61,"DEAR PROF. LAWRENCE,","And the self-denial which led them voluntarily to stint themselves of food,"
62,"DEAR PROF. LAWRENCE,","that we in Europe might be fed, is one of many things about which it is not"
63,"DEAR PROF. LAWRENCE,",easy to speak. Our heart must indeed have been hardened if we had not
64,"DEAR PROF. LAWRENCE,",considered the miracle of those loaves. But I fear that to refer to that
65,"DEAR PROF. LAWRENCE,",great debt in the dedication to this little book may draw on me the
66,"DEAR PROF. LAWRENCE,",ridicule incurred by the poor man who dedicated his book to the Universe.

85,PREFACE,PREFACE
86,PREFACE,
87,PREFACE,"I have to thank various colleagues who have read proofs of this book, in"
88,PREFACE,"whole or in part: first and foremost my old teacher, W. P. Ker; also Robert"
89,PREFACE,"Priebsch, J. H. G. Grattan, Ernest Classen and two old students, Miss E. V."
90,PREFACE,Hitchcock and Mrs Blackman. I have also to thank Prof. W. W. Lawrence of
91,PREFACE,"Columbia; and though there are details where we do not agree, I think there"
92,PREFACE,is no difference upon any important issues. If in these details I am in the
93,PREFACE,"right, this is largely due to the helpful criticism of Prof. Lawrence,"
94,PREFACE,"which has often led me to reconsider my conclusions, and to re-state them"
95,PREFACE,"more cautiously, and, I hope, more correctly. If, on the other hand, I am"
96,PREFACE,"in the wrong, then it is thanks to Prof. Lawrence that I am not still more"
97,PREFACE,in the wrong.
98,PREFACE,
99,PREFACE,"From Axel Olrik, though my debt to him is heavy, I find myself differing on"
100,PREFACE,several questions. I had hoped that what I had to urge on some of these
101,PREFACE,"might have convinced him, or, better still, might have drawn from him a"
102,PREFACE,reply which would have convinced me. But the death of that great scholar
103,PREFACE,"has put an end to many hopes, and deprived many of us of a warm personal"
104,PREFACE,friend. It would be impossible to modify now these passages expressing
105,PREFACE,"dissent, for the early pages of this book were printed off some years ago."
106,PREFACE,I can only repeat that it is just because of my intense respect for the
107,PREFACE,"work of Dr Olrik that, where I cannot agree with his conclusions, I feel"
108,PREFACE,"bound to go into the matter at length. Names like those of Olrik, Bradley,"
109,PREFACE,Chadwick and Sievers carry rightly such authority as to make it the duty of
110,PREFACE,"those who differ, if only on minor details, to justify that difference if"
111,PREFACE,they can.
112,PREFACE,
113,PREFACE,From Dr Bradley especially I have had help in discussing various of these
114,PREFACE,"problems: also from Mr Wharton of the British Museum, Prof. Collin of"
115,PREFACE,"Christiania, Mr Ritchie Girvan of Glasgow, and Mr Teddy. To Prof. Brøgger,"
116,PREFACE,"the Norwegian state-antiquary, I am indebted for permission to reproduce"
117,PREFACE,photographs of the {viii} Viking ships: to Prof. Finnur Jónsson for
118,PREFACE,permission to quote from his most useful edition of the _Hrólfs Saga_ and
119,PREFACE,"the _Bjarka Rímur_, and, above all, to Mr Sigfús Blöndal, of the Royal"
120,PREFACE,"Library of Copenhagen, for his labour in collating with the manuscript the"
121,PREFACE,passages quoted from the _Grettis Saga_.
122,PREFACE,
123,PREFACE,"Finally, I have to thank the Syndics of the University Press for"
124,PREFACE,"undertaking the publication of the book, and the staff for the efficient"
125,PREFACE,"way in which they have carried out the work, in spite of the long"
126,PREFACE,interruption caused by the war.

372,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,"of Anglo-Saxon times: ""a book got up with some care,"" as if intended for"
373,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,the library of a nobleman or of a monastery. Yet this MS is removed from
374,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,the date when the poem was composed and from the events which it narrates
375,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,(so far as these events are historic at all) by periods of time
376,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,approximately equal to those which separate us from the time when

383,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,the business of three generations of scholars distributed among the ten
384,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,nations of Germanic speech. A whole library has been written around our

390,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,"The story which the MS tells us may be summarized thus: Beowulf, a prince"
391,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,"of the Geatas, voyages to Heorot, the hall of Hrothgar, king of the Danes;"
392,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,"there he destroys a monster Grendel, who for twelve years has haunted the"
393,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,hall by night and slain all he found therein. When Grendel's mother in
394,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,"revenge makes an attack on the hall, Beowulf seeks her out and kills her"
395,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,also in her home beneath the waters. He then {2} returns to his land with
396,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,honour and is rewarded by his king Hygelac. Ultimately he himself becomes
397,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,"king of the Geatas, and fifty years later slays a dragon and is slain by"
398,SECTION I. THE PROBLEM.,it. The poem closes with an account of the funeral rites.

409,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,
410,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,Beowulf's people have been identified with many tribes: but there is strong
411,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,"evidence that the Geatas are the Götar (O.N. _Gautar_), the inhabitants of"
412,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,"what is now a portion of Southern Sweden, immediately to the south of the"
413,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,great lakes Wener and Wetter. The names _Geatas_ and _Gautar_ correspond
414,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,"exactly[3], according to the rules of O.E. and O.N. phonetic development,"
415,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,and all we can ascertain of the Geatas and of the Gautar harmonizes well
416,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,with the identification[4].
417,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,
418,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,We know of one occasion only when the Geatas came into violent contact with
419,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,the world outside Scandinavia. Putting together the accounts which we
420,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,"receive from Gregory of Tours and from two other (anonymous) writers, we"
421,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,learn that a piratical raid was made upon the country of the Atuarii (the
422,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,O.E. _Hetware_) who dwelt between the lower Rhine and what is now the
423,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,"Zuyder Zee, by a king whose name is spelt in a variety of ways, all of"
424,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,which readily admit of identification with that of the Hygelac of our
425,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,poem[5]. From the land of the Atuarii this king carried much spoil to his
426,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,"ships; but, remaining on shore, he was overwhelmed and slain by the army"
427,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,which the {3} Frankish king Theodoric had sent under his son to the rescue
428,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,of these outlying provinces; the plunderers' fleet was routed and the booty
429,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,"restored to the country. The bones of this gigantic king of the ""Getae"""
430,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,"[presumably = Geatas] were long preserved, it was said, on an island near"
431,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,the mouth of the Rhine.
432,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,
433,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,"Such is the story of the raid, so far as we can reconstruct it from monkish"
434,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,"Latin sources. The precise date is not given, but it must have been between"
435,SECTION II. THE GEATAS--THEIR KINGS AND THEIR WARS.,A.D. 512 and 520.

684,"II_, 274).","(1) _Geatas_ etymologically corresponds exactly with O.N. _Gautar_, the"

687,"II_, 274).","the West Saxon _Iete_, _Yte_."
688,"II_, 274).",
689,"II_, 274).","Now it is true that in one passage in the O.E. translation of Bede (I,"
690,"II_, 274).","15) the word ""Iutarum"" _is_ rendered _Geata_: but in the other (IV, 16)"
691,"II_, 274).","""Iutorum"" is rendered _Eota_, _Ytena_. And this latter rendering is"
692,"II_, 274).","supported (_a_) by the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ (_Iotum_, _Iutna_) and"
693,"II_, 274).","(_b_) by the fact that the current O.E. word for Jutes was _Yte_,"
694,"II_, 274).","_Ytan_, which survived till after the Norman conquest. For the name"
695,"II_, 274).",_Ytena land_ was used for that portion of Hampshire which had been
696,"II_, 274).","settled by the Jutes: William Rufus was slain, according to Florence of"
697,"II_, 274).","Worcester, in _Ytene_ (which Florence explains as _prouincia Jutarum_)."
698,"II_, 274).",
699,"II_, 274).","From the purely etymological point of view the Götar-hypothesis, then,"
700,"II_, 274).","is unimpeachable: but the Jute-hypothesis is unsatisfactory, since it"
701,"II_, 274).","is based upon one passage in the O.E. Bede, where _Jutarum_ is"

1016,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,
1017,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,{17} (_a_) That the modern Leire occupies the site of the ancient Leire has
1018,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"indeed been disputed[34], but seems hardly open to doubt, in view of the"
1019,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"express words of the Danish chroniclers[35]. It is true that the mounds,"
1020,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,which these early chroniclers probably imagined as covering the ashes of
1021,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"'Haldanus' or 'Roe,' and which later antiquaries dubbed with the names of"
1022,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"other kings, are now thought to belong, not to the time of Hrothgar, but to"
1023,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,the Stone or Bronze Ages. But this evidence that Leire was a place of
1024,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"importance thousands of years before Hrothgar or Hrothulf were born, in no"
1025,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,wise invalidates the overwhelming evidence that it was their residence
1026,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,also.
1027,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,
1028,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,The equation of the modern Leire with the Leire of Rolf Kraki we may then
1029,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,accept. We cannot be quite so sure of our thesis (_b_): that the ancient
1030,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,Leire was identical with the site where Hrothgar built Heorot. But it is
1031,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,highly probable: for although Leire is more particularly connected with the
1032,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"memory of Rolf Kraki himself, we are assured, in one of the mediæval Danish"
1033,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"chronicles, that Leire was the royal seat of Rolf's predecessors as well:"
1034,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"of Ro (Hrothgar) and of Ro's father: and that Ro ""enriched it with great"
1035,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"magnificence[36]."" Ro also, according to this chronicler, heaped a mound at"
1036,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"Leire over the grave of his father, and was himself buried at Leire under"
1037,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,another mound.
1038,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,
1039,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,Now since the Danish tradition represents Hrothgar as enriching his royal
1040,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"town of Leire, whilst English tradition commemorates him as a builder king,"
1041,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"constructing a royal hall ""greater than the sons of men had ever heard"

1043,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"of the same fact, and that the site of that hall was Leire. That Heorot,"
1044,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"the picturesque name of the hall itself, should, in English tradition, have"
1045,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"been remembered, whilst that of the town where it was built had been"

1047,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"such numbers, after the settlement of the Angles in England, it was very"
1048,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"rarely indeed, so far as we can judge, that the Angles and Saxons continued"

1073,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"said to have built Roskilde, not as a capital for himself, but as a"
1074,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,market-place for the merchants: there is no suggestion that it was his
1075,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"royal town, though in time it became the capital, and its cathedral is"

1077,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,
1078,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,What at first sight looks so much in favour of our equating {19} Roskilde
1079,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,with Heorot--the presence in its name of the element _Ro_ (Hrothgar)--is in
1080,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,reality the most suspicious thing about the identification. There are other
1081,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"names in Denmark with the element _Ro_, in places where it is quite"
1082,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,impossible to suppose that the king's name is commemorated. Some other
1083,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"explanation of the name has therefore to be sought, and it is very probable"
1084,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"that Roskilde meant originally not ""Hrothgar's spring,"" but ""the horses'"
1085,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"spring,"" and that the connection with King Ro is simply one of those"
1086,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,inevitable pieces of popular etymology which take place so soon as the true
1087,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,origin of a name is forgotten[41].
1088,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,
1089,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"Leire has, then, a much better claim than Roskilde to being the site of"
1090,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,Heorot: and geographical considerations confirm this. For Heorot is clearly
1091,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"imagined by the poet of _Beowulf_ as being some distance inland; and this,"
1092,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"whilst it suits admirably the position of Leire, is quite inapplicable to"
1093,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"Roskilde, which is situated on the sea at the head of the Roskilde"
1094,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"fjord[42]. Of course we must not expect to find the poet of _Beowulf_, or"
1095,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"indeed any epic poet, minutely exact in his geography. At the same time it"
1096,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,is clear that at the time _Beowulf_ was written there were traditions
1097,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"extant, dealing with the attack made upon Heorot by the ancestral foes of"
1098,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"the Danes, a tribe called the Heathobeardan. These accounts of the fighting"
1099,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"around Heorot must have preserved the general impression of its situation,"
1100,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,precisely as from the _Iliad_ we know that Troy is neither on the sea nor
1101,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,"yet very remote from it. A poet would draw on his imagination for details,"
1102,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,but would hardly alter a feature like this.
1103,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,
1104,SECTION IV. LEIRE AND HEOROT.,In these matters absolute certainty cannot be reached: but we may be fairly

1124,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"at Heorot and the attack of the Heathobeardan upon them, rather than any"
1125,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"story of monster-quelling, was what the old poets more particularly"
1126,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,associated with the name of Heorot. The passage in _Widsith_ runs:
1127,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1128,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"""For a very long time did Hrothgar and Hrothwulf, uncle and nephew,"
1129,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"hold the peace together, after they had driven away the race of the"
1130,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"Vikings and humbled the array of Ingeld, had hewed down at Heorot the"

1132,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1133,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"The details of this war can be reconstructed, partly from the allusions in"
1134,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"_Beowulf_, partly from the Scandinavian accounts. The Scandinavian versions"
1135,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,are less primitive and historic. They have forgotten all about the
1136,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"Heathobeardan as an independent tribe, and, whilst remembering the names of"
1137,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"the leading chieftains on both sides, they see in them members of two rival"
1138,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,branches of the Danish royal house.
1139,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1140,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,We gather from _Beowulf_ that for generations a blood feud has raged
1141,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,between the Danes and the Heathobeardan. Nothing is told us in _Beowulf_
1142,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"about the king Healfdene, except that he {21} was fierce in war and that he"
1143,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,lived to be old. From the Scandinavian stories it seems clear that he was
1144,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,concerned in the Heathobard feud. According to some later Scandinavian
1145,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"accounts he was slain by Frothi (=Froda, whom we know from _Beowulf_ to"
1146,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,have been king of the Heathobeardan) and this may well have been the
1147,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"historic fact[44]. How Hroar and Helgi (Hrothgar and Halga), the sons of"
1148,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"Halfdan (Healfdene), evaded the pursuit of Frothi, we learn from the"
1149,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,Scandinavian tales; whether the Old English story knew anything of their
1150,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"hair-breadth escapes we cannot tell. Ultimately, the saga tells us, Hroar"
1151,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"and Helgi, in revenge for their father's death, burnt the hall over the"
1152,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"head of his slayer, Frothi[45]. To judge from the hints in _Beowulf_, it"
1153,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,would rather seem that the Old English tradition represented this vengeance
1154,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,upon Froda as having been inflicted in a pitched battle. The eldest brother
1155,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,Heorogar--known only to the English story--perhaps took his share in this
1156,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"feat. But, after his brothers Heorogar and Halga were dead, Hrothgar, left"
1157,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"alone, and fearing vengeance in his turn, strove to compose the feud by"
1158,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"wedding his daughter Freawaru to Ingeld, the son of Froda. So much we learn"
1159,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"from the report which Beowulf gives, on his return home, to Hygelac, as to"
1160,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,the state of things at the Danish court.
1161,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1162,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"Beowulf is depicted as carrying a very sage head upon his young shoulders,"
1163,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,and he gives evidence of his astuteness by predicting[46] that the peace
1164,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,which Hrothgar has purchased will not be lasting. Some Heathobard survivor
1165,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"of the fight in which Froda fell, will, he thinks, see a young Dane in the"
1166,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"retinue of Freawaru proudly pacing the hall, wearing the treasures which"
1167,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,his father had won from the Heathobeardan. Then the old warrior will urge
1168,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"on his younger comrade ""Canst thou, my lord, tell the sword, the dear iron,"
1169,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"which thy father carried to the fight when he bore helm for the last time,"
1170,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,when the Danes slew him and had the victory? And now the son {22} of one of
1171,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"these slayers paces the hall, proud of his arms, boasts of the slaughter"
1172,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"and wears the precious sword which thou by right shouldst wield[47]."""
1173,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1174,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"Such a reminder as this no Germanic warrior could long resist. So, Beowulf"
1175,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"thinks, the young Dane will be slain; Ingeld will cease to take joy in his"
1176,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,bride; and the old feud will break out afresh.
1177,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1178,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"That it did so we know from _Widsith_, and from the same source we know"
1179,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,that this Heathobard attack was repulsed by the combined strength of
1180,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,Hrothgar and his nephew Hrothulf.
1181,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1182,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"But the tragic figure of Ingeld, hesitating between love for his father and"
1183,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"love for his wife, between the duty of vengeance and his plighted word, was"
1184,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,one which was sure to attract the interest of the old heroic poets more
1185,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,even than those of the victorious uncle and nephew. In the eighth century
1186,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"Alcuin, the Northumbrian, quotes Ingeld as the typical hero of song."
1187,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"Writing to a bishop of Lindisfarne, he reproves the monks for their"
1188,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"fondness for the old stories about heathen kings, who are now lamenting"
1189,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"their sins in Hell: ""in the Refectory,"" he says, ""the Bible should be read:"
1190,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"the lector heard, not the harper: patristic sermons rather than pagan"
1191,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"songs. For what has Ingeld to do with Christ[48]?"" This protest testifies"
1192,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"eloquently to the popularity of the Ingeld story, and further evidence is"
1193,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,possibly afforded by the fact that few heroes of story seem to have had so
1194,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,many namesakes in Eighth Century England.
1195,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1196,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,What is emphasized in _Beowulf_ is not so much the struggle in the mind of
1197,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"Ingeld as the stern, unforgiving temper of the grim old warrior who will"
1198,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,not let the feud die down; and this is the case also with the Danish

1228,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1229,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,Who the Heathobeardan were is uncertain. It is frequently argued that
1230,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,they are identical with the Longobardi; that the words _Heatho-Bard_
1231,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"and _Long-Bard_ correspond, just as we get sometimes _Gar-Dene_,"
1232,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"sometimes _Hring-Dene_. (So Heyne; Bremer in _Pauls Grdr._ (2) III, 949"
1233,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"_etc._) The evidence for this is however unsatisfactory (see Chambers,"
1234,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"_Widsith_, 205). Since the year 186 A.D. onwards the Longobardi were"
1235,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"dwelling far inland, and were certainly never in a position from which"
1236,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"an attack upon the Danes would have been practicable. If, therefore, we"
1237,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"accept the identification of Heatho-Bard and Long-Bard, we must suppose"
1238,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,the Heathobeardan of _Beowulf_ to have been not the Longobardi of
1239,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"history, but a separate portion of the people, which had been left"
1240,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"behind on the shores of the Baltic, when the main body went south. But"
1241,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"as we have no evidence for any such offshoot from the main tribe, it is"
1242,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,misleading to speak of the Heathobeardan as identical with the
1243,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,Longobardi: and although the similarity of one element in the name
1244,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"suggests some primitive relationship, that relationship may well have"
1245,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,been exceedingly remote[52].
1246,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1247,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,{24}
1248,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1249,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,It has further been proposed to identify the Heathobeardan with the
1250,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"Heruli[53]. The Heruli came from the Scandinavian district, overran"
1251,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"Europe, and became famous for their valour, savagery, and value as"
1252,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"light-armed troops. If the Heathobeardan are identical with the Heruli,"
1253,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"and if what we are told of the customs of the Heruli is true, Freawaru"
1254,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,was certainly to be pitied. The Heruli were accustomed to put to death
1255,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,their sick and aged: and to compel widows to commit suicide.
1256,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1257,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,The supposed identity of the Heruli with the Heathobeardan is however
1258,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,very doubtful. It rests solely upon the statement of Jordanes that they
1259,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,had been driven from their homes by the Danes (_Dani ... Herulos
1260,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"propriis sedibus expulerunt_). This is inconclusive, since the growth"
1261,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,of the Danish power is likely enough to have led to collisions with
1262,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"more than one tribe. In fact _Beowulf_ tells us that Scyld ""tore away"
1263,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"the mead benches from _many_ a people."" On the other hand the"
1264,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,dissimilarity of names is not conclusive evidence against the
1265,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"identification, for the word _Heruli_ is pretty certainly the same as"
1266,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"the Old English _Eorlas_, and is a complimentary nick-name applied by"
1267,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"the tribe to themselves, rather than their original racial designation."
1268,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1269,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"Nothing, then, is really known of the Heathobeardan, except that"
1270,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,evidence points to their having dwelt somewhere on the Baltic[54].
1271,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1272,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,The Scandinavian sources which have preserved the memory of this feud
1273,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,have transformed it in an extraordinary way. The Heathobeardan came to
1274,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"be quite forgotten, although maybe some trace of their name remains in"
1275,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"_Hothbrodd_, who is represented as the foe of Roe (Hrothgar) and Rolf"
1276,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"(Hrothulf). When the Heathobeardan were forgotten, Froda and Ingeld"
1277,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"were left without any subjects, and naturally came to be regarded, like"
1278,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"Healfdene and the other kings with whom they were associated in story,"
1279,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,as Danish kings. Accordingly the tale developed in Scandinavian lands
1280,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"in two ways. Some documents, and especially the Icelandic ones[55],"
1281,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,represent the struggle as a feud between two branches of the Danish
1282,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,royal house. Even here there is no agreement who is the usurper and who
1283,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"the victim, so that sometimes it is Froda and sometimes Healfdene who"
1284,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,is represented as the traitor and murderer.
1285,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,
1286,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,But another version[56]--the Danish--whilst making Froda and Ingeld
1287,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"into Danish kings, separates their story altogether from that of"
1288,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,Healfdene and his house: in this version the quarrel is still thought
1289,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"of as being between two nations, not as between the rightful heir to"
1290,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,the throne and a treacherous and relentless usurper. Accordingly the
1291,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"feud is such as may be, at any rate temporarily, laid aside: peace"
1292,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,between the contending parties is not out of the question. This version
1293,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"therefore preserves much more of the original character of the story,"
1294,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"for it remains the tale of a young prince who, willing to marry into"
1295,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"the house of his ancestral foes and to forgive and forget the old feud,"
1296,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,is stirred by his more unrelenting henchman into taking vengeance for
1297,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"his father. But, owing to the prince having come to be represented as a"
1298,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"Dane, patriotic reasons have suggested to the {25} Danish poets and"
1299,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,historians a quite different conclusion to the story. Instead of being
1300,SECTION V. THE HEATHOBEARDAN.,"routed, Ingeld, in Saxo, is successful in his revenge."

1363,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"himself, a king of the Danes, and must, therefore, have preceded Roluo on"

1401,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,never supposed to be due solely to the recklessness of the monarch
1402,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,himself--it was the work of an evil counsellor--a Bikki or an Iring. Now we
1403,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,have seen that there is mischief brewing in Heorot--and we are introduced
1404,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"to a counsellor Unferth, the _thyle_ or official spokesman and adviser of"
1405,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,King Hrothgar. And Unferth is evil. His jealous temper is shown by the
1406,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,hostile and inhospitable reception which he gives to Beowulf. And Beowulf's
1407,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"reply gives us a hint of some darker stain: ""though {28} thou hast been the"
1408,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,slayer of thine own brethren--thy flesh and blood: for that thou shalt
1409,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"suffer damnation in hell, good though thy wit may be[68]."" One might"
1410,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"perhaps think that Beowulf in these words was only giving the ""countercheck"
1411,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"quarrelsome,"" and indulging in mere reckless abuse, just as Sinfjotli (the"
1412,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,Fitela of _Beowulf_) in the _First Helgi Lay_ hurls at his foes all kinds
1413,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"of outrageous charges assuredly not meant to be taken literally. But, as we"
1414,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"learn from the _Helgi Lay_ itself, the uttering of such unfounded taunts"
1415,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,was not considered good form; whilst it seems pretty clear that the speech
1416,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,of Beowulf to Unferth is intended as an example of justifiable and spirited
1417,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"self-defence, not, like the speech of Sinfjotli, as a storehouse of things"
1418,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,which a well-mannered warrior should _not_ say.
1419,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,
1420,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"Besides, the taunt of Beowulf is confirmed, although but darkly, by the"

1422,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,Wealhtheow lest perhaps Hrothulf should not be loyal to Hrothgar and his
1423,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"issue: ""Likewise there Unferth the counsellor sat at the foot of the lord"
1424,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,of the Scyldingas: each of them [i.e. both Hrothgar and Hrothulf] trusted
1425,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"to his spirit: that his courage was great, _though he had not done his duty"
1426,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"by his kinsmen at the sword-play_[69]."""
1427,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,
1428,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"But, granting that Unferth has really been the cause of the death of his"
1429,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"kinsmen, some scholars have doubted whether we are to suppose that he"
1430,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"literally slew them himself. For, had that been the case, they urge, he"
1431,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,could not be occupying a place of trust with the almost ideal king
1432,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,Hrothgar. But the record of the historians makes it quite clear that murder
1433,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"of kin did happen, and that constantly[70]. Amid the tragic complexities of"
1434,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"heroic life it often could not be avoided. The _comitatus_-system, by which"
1435,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,a man was expected to give unflinching support to any chief whose service
1436,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"he had entered, must often have resulted in slaughter between men united by"
1437,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"very close bonds of kin or friendship. Turning from history to saga, we"
1438,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"find some of the greatest heroes not free from the stain. Sigmund, {29}"
1439,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"Gunnar, Hogni, Atli, Hrothulf, Heoroweard, Hnæf, Eadgils, Hæthcyn,"
1440,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"Ermanaric and Hildebrand were all marred with this taint, and indeed were,"
1441,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"in many cases, rather to be pitied than blamed. I doubt, therefore, whether"
1442,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,we need try and save Unferth's character by suggesting that the stern words
1443,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,of the poet mean only that he had indirectly caused the death of his
1444,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"brethren by failing them, in battle, at some critical moment[71]. I suspect"
1445,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"that this, involving cowardice or incompetence, would have been held the"
1446,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"more unpardonable offence, and _would_ have resulted in Unferth's disgrace."
1447,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"But a man might well have slain his kin under circumstances which, while"
1448,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"leaving a blot on his record, did not necessitate his banishment from good"
1449,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"society. All the same, the poet evidently thinks it a weakness on the part"
1450,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"of Hrothgar and Hrothulf that, after what has happened, they still put"
1451,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,their trust in Unferth.
1452,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,
1453,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,Here then is the situation. The king has a counsellor: that counsellor is
1454,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,evil. Both the king and his nephew trust the evil counsellor. A bitter feud
1455,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,springs up between the king and his nephew. That the feud was due to the
1456,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,machinations of the evil adviser can hardly be doubted by those who have
1457,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,studied the ways of the old Germanic heroic story. But it is only an

1462,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"Lastly, there is Heoroweard. Of him we are told in _Beowulf_ very little."
1463,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"He is son of Heorogar (or Heregar), Hrothgar's elder brother, who was"
1464,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"apparently king before him, but died young[72]. It is quite natural, as we"
1465,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"have seen, that, if Heoroweard was too young for the responsibility when"
1466,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"his father died, he should not have succeeded to the throne. What is not so"
1467,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"natural is that he does not inherit his father's arms, which one might"
1468,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"reasonably have supposed Hrothgar would have preserved, to give to him when"
1469,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"he came of age. Instead, Hrothgar gives them to Beowulf[73]. Does Hrothgar"
1470,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"deliberately avoid doing honour to Heoroweard, because he fears that any"
1471,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,distinction conferred upon him would strengthen a rival {30} whose claims
1472,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"to the throne might endanger those of his own sons? However this may be, in"
1473,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,any future struggle for the throne Heoroweard may reasonably be expected to

1475,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,
1476,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"Turning now to Saxo, and to the _Saga of Rolf Kraki_, we find that Rolf"

1478,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"that of Heoroweard--Hiarwarus (Saxo), Hj[o,]rvarthr (_Saga_). Neither Saxo"
1479,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,nor the _Saga_ thinks of Hiarwarus as the cousin of Rolf Kraki: they do not
1480,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,make it really clear _what_ the cause of his enmity was. But they tell us
1481,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"that, after a banquet, he and his men treacherously rose upon Rolf and his"
1482,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,warriors. The defence which Rolf and his men put up in their burning hall:
1483,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"the loyalty and defiance of Rolf's champions, invincible in death--these"
1484,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,were amongst the most famous things of the North; they were told in the
1485,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"_Bjarkamál_, now unfortunately extant in Saxo's paraphrase only."
1486,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,
1487,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"But the triumph of Hiarwarus was brief. Rolf's men all fell around him,"
1488,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"save the young Wiggo, who had previously, in the confidence of youth,"
1489,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"boasted that, should Rolf fall, he would avenge him. Astonished at the"
1490,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"loyalty of Rolf's champions, Hiarwarus expressed regret that none had taken"
1491,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"quarter, declaring that he would gladly accept the service of such men."
1492,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"Whereupon Wiggo came from the hiding-place where he had taken refuge, and"
1493,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"offered to do homage to Hiarwarus, by placing his hand on the hilt of his"
1494,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"new lord's sword: but in doing so he drove the point through Hiarwarus, and"
1495,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,rejoiced as he received his death from the attendants of the foe he had
1496,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,slain. It shows how entirely the duty of vengeance was felt to outweigh all
1497,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"other considerations, that this treacherous act of Wiggo is always spoken"
1498,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,of with the highest praise.

1508,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"bad character of Unferth has its part to play: ""It is a _weakness_ in"
1509,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,Hrothgar that he entrusts important office to such a man--a {31}
1510,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,"weakness which will carry its punishment."" Independently the domestic"
1511,SECTION VI. HROTHULF.,feud was demonstrated again by Sarrazin (_Rolf Krake und sein vetter im

1531,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,was celebrated through the Middle Ages chiefly as the founder of the great
1532,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,abbey of St Albans. This Offa is sometimes referred to as Offa _the
1533,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Second_, because he had a remote ancestor, Offa I, who, if the Mercian"
1534,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"pedigree can be trusted, lived twelve generations earlier, and therefore"
1535,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"presumably in the latter half of the fourth century. Offa I, then, must"

1538,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1539,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,Now the Offa mentioned in _Beowulf_ is spoken of as related to Garmund and
1540,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Eomer (MS _geomor_). This, apart from the abundant further evidence, is"

1551,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"gained, first of men, by arms the greatest of kingdoms whilst yet a"
1552,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,boy; no one of equal age ever did greater deeds of valour in battle
1553,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,with his single sword: he drew the boundary against the Myrgingas at

1562,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1563,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"After the lapse of some five centuries, we get abundant further information"

1566,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"kingdom of Angel: for as Angel was incorporated into the Danish kingdom, so"
1567,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,these stories became part of the stock of Danish national legend. Offa came
1568,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"to be regarded as a Danish king, and his story is told at length by the two"
1569,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"earliest historians of Denmark, Sweyn Aageson and Saxo Grammaticus. In Saxo"
1570,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,the story runs thus:
1571,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1572,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Wermund, king of Denmark, had a son Uffo [Offa], tall beyond the measure of"

1574,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"neighbour, the king of Saxony, laid claim to Denmark on the ground that he"
1575,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"was no longer fit to rule, and, relying upon Uffo's incapacity, suggested"
1576,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,that the quarrel should be decided by their two sons in single combat.
1577,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Wermund, in despair, offered himself to fight, in spite of his blindness:"
1578,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"this offer the envoys of the Saxon king refused with insult, and the Danes"
1579,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"knew not what to say. Thereupon Uffo, who happened to be present, suddenly"
1580,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,asked leave to speak. Wermund could not believe that it was really his son
1581,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"who had spoken, but when they all assured him that it _was_, he gave the"
1582,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"permission. ""In vain,"" then said Uffo, ""does the king of Saxony covet the"
1583,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"land of Denmark, which trusts to its true king and its brave nobles:"
1584,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"neither is a son wanting to the king nor a successor to the kingdom."" And"

1587,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1588,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,The Saxon envoys accepted the offer and departed. The blind king was at

1591,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"split the rings of every coat of mail: the largest, his father's, had to be"
1592,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,cleft down the side and fastened with a clasp. Likewise no sword {33} was
1593,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"so well tempered that he did not shatter it by merely brandishing it, till"
1594,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"the old king directed his men how they might find his ancient sword,"
1595,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"_Skrep_ (= ? stedfast) which he had buried, in despair, thinking his son"
1596,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"unworthy of it. The sword, when found, was so frail from age that Uffo did"
1597,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"not test it: for Wermund told him that, if he broke it, there was no other"
1598,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,left strong enough for him.
1599,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1600,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"So Uffo and his two antagonists were taken to the place of combat, an"
1601,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"island in the river Eider. Crowds lined either bank, and Wermund stood"
1602,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,prepared to throw himself into the river should his son be slain. Uffo held
1603,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"back at first, till he had discovered which of his antagonists was the more"
1604,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"dangerous, since he feared the sword would only be good for one blow. Then,"
1605,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"having by his taunts induced the champion to come to close quarters, he"
1606,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,clove him asunder with one stroke. Wermund cried out that he had heard the
1607,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"sound of his son's sword, and asked where the blow had fallen: his"
1608,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"attendants assured him that it had pierced, not any particular part, but"
1609,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,the man's whole structure.
1610,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1611,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"So Wermund drew back from the edge, desiring life now as keenly as before"
1612,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"he had longed for death. Finally Uffo smote his second antagonist through,"
1613,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,thus opening a career which after such a beginning we may well believe to
1614,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,have been glorious.
1615,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1616,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,The story is told again by Sweyn Aageson in a slightly varying form.
1617,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,Sweyn's story has some good traits of its own--as when it makes Uffo enter
1618,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"the lists girt with _two_ swords, intending to use his father's only in an"
1619,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"emergency. The worthless sword breaks, and all the Danes quake for fear:"
1620,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,whereupon Uffo draws the old sword and achieves the victory. But above all
1621,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Sweyn Aageson tells us the _reason_ of Uffo's dumbness and incapacity,"
1622,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,which Saxo leaves obscure: it was the result of shame over the deeds of two
1623,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,Danes who had combined to avenge their father upon a single foe. What is
1624,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"the incident referred to we can gather from Saxo. Two Danes, Keto and Wigo,"
1625,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"whose father Frowinus had been slain by a hostile king Athislus, attacked"
1626,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Athislus together, two to one, thus breaking the laws of the duel. Uffo had"
1627,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"wedded the sister of {34} Keto and Wigo, and it was in order to wipe out"
1628,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,the stain left upon his family and his nation by their breach of duelling
1629,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,etiquette that he insisted upon fighting single-handed against two
1630,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,opponents.
1631,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1632,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,That this incident was also known in England is rendered probable by the
1633,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"fact that Freawine and Wig, who correspond to Saxo's Frowinus and Wiggo,"
1634,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"are found in the genealogy of English kings, and that an Eadgils, king of"
1635,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"the Myrgingas, who is almost certainly the Athislus of Saxo[74], also"
1636,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,appears in Old English heroic poetry. It is probable then that the two
1637,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,tales were connected in Old English story: the two brethren shamefully
1638,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,combine to avenge their father: in due time the family of the slain foe
1639,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,take up the feud: Offa saves his country and his country's honour by
1640,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,voluntarily undertaking to fight one against two.
1641,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1642,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"About the same time that the Danish ecclesiastics were at work, a monk of"
1643,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,St Albans was committing to Latin the English stories which were still
1644,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"current concerning Offa. The object of the English writer was, however,"
1645,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,local rather than national. He wrote the _Vitae duorum Offarum_ to
1646,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"celebrate the historic Offa, king of Mercia, the founder of his abbey, and"
1647,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"that founder's ancestor, Offa I: popular tradition had confused the two,"
1648,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,and much is told concerning the Mercian Offa that seems to belong more
1649,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,rightly to his forefather. The St Albans writer drew upon contemporary
1650,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"tradition, and it is evident that in certain cases, as when he gives two"
1651,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"sets of names to some of the chief actors in the story, he is trying to"
1652,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,harmonize two distinct versions: he makes at least one error which seems to
1653,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,point to a written source[75]. In one of the MSS the story is illustrated
1654,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"by a series of very artistic drawings, which might possibly be from the pen"
1655,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,of Matthew Paris himself[76]. These drawings depict a version of the story
1656,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,which in some respects differs from the Latin text which they accompany.

1662,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1663,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,{35} The story is located in England. Warmundus is represented as a king of
1664,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"the Western Angles, ruling at Warwick. Offa, his only son, was blind till"
1665,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"his seventh, dumb till his thirtieth year. Accordingly an ambitious noble,"
1666,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Riganus, otherwise called Aliel, claims to be recognized heir, in hope of"
1667,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"gaining the throne for his son, Hildebrand (Brutus). Offa gains the gift of"
1668,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,speech in answer to prayer; to the joy of his father and the councillors he
1669,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"vindicates his right, much as in the Danish story. He is knighted with a"
1670,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"chosen body of companions, armed, and leads the host to meet the foe. He"
1671,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"dashes across the river which separates the two armies, although his"
1672,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,followers hang back. This act of cowardice on their part is not explained:
1673,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,it is apparently a reminiscence of an older version in which Offa fights
1674,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"his duel single handed by the river, and his host look on. The armies join"
1675,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"battle, but after a long struggle draw away from each other with the"
1676,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,victory undecided. Offa remaining in front of his men is attacked by Brutus
1677,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"(or Hildebrand) and Sueno, the sons of the usurper, and slays them both (a"
1678,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,second reminiscence of the duel-scene). He then hurls himself again upon
1679,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"the foe, and wins the victory."
1680,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1681,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,_Widsith_ shows us that the Danish account has kept closer to the primitive
1682,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,story than has later English tradition. _Widsith_ confirms the Danish view
1683,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"that the quarrel was with a foreign, not with a domestic foe, and the"
1684,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"combat a duel, not a pitched battle: above all, _Widsith_ confirms Saxo in"
1685,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,representing the fight as taking place on the Eider--_b[=i]
1686,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"F[=i]feldore_[77], whilst the account recorded by the monk of St Albans had"
1687,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,localised the story in England.

1691,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"In _Beowulf_ too we hear of Offa as a mighty king, ""the best of all mankind"
1692,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"betwixt the seas."" But, although his wars are referred to, we are given no"
1693,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,details of them. The episode in _Beowulf_ relates rather to his wife
1694,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Thryth, and his dealings with her. The passage is the most obscure in the"
1695,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"whole poem, but this at least is clear: Thryth had an evil reputation for"
1696,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"cruelty and murder: she wedded Offa, and he put a stop to her evil deeds:"
1697,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,she became to him a good and loyal wife.
1698,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1699,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,Now in the _Lives of the two Offas_ quite a long space is devoted to the
1700,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"matrimonial entanglements of both kings. Concerning Offa I, a tale is told"
1701,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"of how he succoured a daughter of the king of York, who had been turned"
1702,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,adrift by her father; how when his years were advancing his subjects
1703,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,pressed him to marry: and how his mind went back to the damsel whom he had
1704,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"saved, and he chose her for his wife. Whilst the king was absent on his"
1705,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"wars, a messenger whom he had sent with a letter to report his victories"
1706,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"passed through York, where the wicked father of Offa's queen lived. A false"
1707,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"letter was substituted, commanding that the queen and her children should"
1708,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"be mutilated and left to die in the woods, because she was a witch and had"
1709,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"brought defeat upon the king's arms. The order was carried out, but a"
1710,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"hermit rescued and healed the queen and her children, and ultimately united"
1711,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,them to the king.
1712,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1713,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"This is a popular folk-tale which is scattered all over Europe, and which"
1714,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,has many times been clothed in literary form: in France in the romance of
1715,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"the _Manekine_, in English in the metrical romance of _Emaré_, and in"
1716,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,Chaucer's _Man of Lawes Tale_. From the name of the heroine in the last of
1717,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"these versions, the tale is often known as the _Constance_-story. But it is"
1718,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,clear that this tale is not identical with the obscure story of the wife of
1719,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Offa, which is indicated in _Beowulf_."
1720,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1721,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"When, however, we turn to the _Life of Offa II_, we do find a very close"
1722,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,parallel to the Thryth story.

1728,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1729,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,{37} This tells how in the days of Charles the Great a certain beautiful
1730,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"but wicked girl, related to that king, was condemned to death on account of"
1731,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"her crimes, but, from respect for her birth, was exposed instead in a boat"
1732,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"without sails or tackle, and driven ashore on the coast of King Offa's"
1733,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"land. Drida, as she said her name was, deceived the king by a tale of"
1734,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"injured innocence, and he committed her to the safe keeping of his mother,"
1735,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"the Countess Marcellina. Later, Offa fell in love with Drida, and married"
1736,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"her, after which she became known as _Quendrida_. But Drida continued her"
1737,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"evil courses and compassed the death of St Æthelbert, the vassal king of"
1738,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,East Anglia. In the end she was murdered by robbers--a just punishment for
1739,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,her crimes--and her widowed husband built the Abbey of St Albans as a
1740,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,thank-offering for her death.
1741,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1742,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,The parallel here is too striking to be denied: for Drida is but another
1743,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"way of spelling Thryth, and the character of the murderous queen is the"
1744,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"same in both stories. There are, however, striking differences: for whereas"
1745,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Thryth ceases from her evil deeds and becomes a model wife to Offa, Drida"
1746,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"continues on her course of crime, and is cut off by violence in the midst"
1747,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,of her evil career. How are we to account for the parallels and for the
1748,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,discrepancies?
1749,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1750,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"As a matter of historical fact, the wife of Offa, king of Mercia, _was_"
1751,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"named (not indeed Cwoenthryth, which is the form which should correspond to"
1752,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Quendrida, but) Cynethryth. The most obvious and facile way of accounting"
1753,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,for the likeness between what we are told in _Beowulf_ of the queen of Offa
1754,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"I, and what we are elsewhere told of the queen of Offa II, is to suppose"
1755,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,that Thryth in _Beowulf_ is a mere fiction evolved from the historic
1756,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Cynethryth, wife of Offa II, and by poetic licence represented as the wife"
1757,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"of his ancestor, Offa I. It was in this way she was explained by Professor"
1758,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,Earle:
1759,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1760,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"The name [Thrytho] was suggested by that of Cynethryth, Offa's"
1761,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,queen.... The vindictive character here given to Thrytho is a poetic
1762,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,and veiled admonition addressed to Cynethryth[78].
1763,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1764,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Unfortunately this, like many another facile theory, is open to fatal"
1765,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"objections. In the first place the poem of _Beowulf_ can, with fair"
1766,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"certainty, be attributed to a date _earlier_ than that at which the"
1767,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"historic Offa and his spouse lived. Of course, it may be said that the Offa"
1768,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,episode in _Beowulf_ is an interpolation of a later date. But this needs
1769,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,proof.
1770,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1771,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,There are metrical and above all syntactical grounds {38} which have led
1772,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,most scholars to place _Beowulf_ very early[79]. If we wish to regard the
1773,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"_Offa-Thryth_-episode as a later interpolation, we ought first to prove"
1774,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,that it is later in its syntax and metre. We have no right to assume that
1775,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,the episode is an interpolation merely because such an assumption may suit
1776,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,our theory of the development of _Beowulf_. So until reasons are
1777,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,forthcoming for supposing the episode of Thryth to be later than the rest
1778,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"of the poem, we can but note that what we know of the date of _Beowulf_"
1779,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"forbids us to accept Earle's theory that Thryth is a reflection of, or"
1780,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"upon, the historic Cynethryth."
1781,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1782,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,But there are difficulties in the way of Earle's theory even more serious
1783,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,than the chronological one. We know nothing very definitely about the wife
1784,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"of Offa II, except her name, but from a reference in a letter of Alcuin it"
1785,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,seems clear that she was a woman of marked piety: it is not likely that she
1786,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,could have been guilty of deliberate murder of the kind represented in the
1787,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"_Life of Offa II_. The St Albans _Life_ depends, so far as we know, upon"
1788,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,the traditions which were current four centuries after her death. There may
1789,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"be, there doubtless are, some historic facts concerning Offa preserved in"
1790,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,it: but we have no reason to think that the bad character of Offa's queen
1791,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"is one of them. Indeed, on purely intrinsic grounds we might well suppose"
1792,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,the reverse. As a matter of history we know that Offa _did_ put to death
1793,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Æthelberht, the vassal king of East Anglia. When in the _Life_ we find Offa"
1794,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"completely exonerated, and the deed represented as an assassination brought"
1795,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"about by the malice and cruelty of his queen, it seems intrinsically likely"
1796,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,that we are dealing with an attempt of the monks to clear their founder by
1797,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,transferring his cruel deeds to the account of his wife.
1798,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1799,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"So far, then, from Thryth being a reflection of an historic cruel queen"
1800,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Cynethryth, it is more probable that the influence has been in the reverse"
1801,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,direction; that the pious Cynethryth has been represented as a monster of
1802,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,cruelty because she has not unnaturally been confused with a mythical
1803,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Thryth, the wife of Offa I."
1804,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1805,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,To this it may be objected that we have no right to assume remarkable
1806,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"coincidences, and that such a coincidence is {39} involved by the"
1807,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"assumption that there was a story of a mythical Thryth, the wife of Offa I,"
1808,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"and that this existed prior to, and independently of, the actual wedding of"
1809,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,Offa II to a Cynethryth. But the exceeding frequency of the element
1810,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,_thryth_ in the names of women robs this objection of all its point. Such a
1811,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"coincidence, far from being remarkable, would be the most natural in the"
1812,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,world. If we look at the Mercian pedigree we find that almost half the
1813,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,ladies connected with it have that element _thryth_ in their names. The
1814,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"founder of the house, Wihtlæg, according to Saxo Grammaticus[80], wedded"
1815,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Hermuthruda, the old English form of which would be Eormenthryth."
1816,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1817,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,It is to this lady Hermuthruda that we must now devote our attention. She
1818,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,belongs to a type which is common in folk-tale down to the time of Hans
1819,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,Andersen--the cruel princess who puts her lovers to death unless they can
1820,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"vanquish her in some way, worsting her in a contest of wits, such as the"
1821,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"guessing of riddles, or a contest of strength, such as running, jumping, or"
1822,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"wrestling. The stock example of this perilous maiden is, of course, for"
1823,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"classical story Atalanta, for Germanic tradition the Brunhilt of the"
1824,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"_Nibelungen Lied_, who demands from her wooer that he shall surpass her in"
1825,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"all three feats; if he fails in one, his head is forfeit[81]."
1826,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1827,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Of this type was Hermuthruda: ""in the cruelty of her arrogance she had"
1828,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"always loathed her wooers, and inflicted upon them the supreme punishment,"
1829,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,so that out of many there was not one but paid for his boldness with his
1830,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"head[82],"" words which remind us strongly of what our poet says of Thryth."
1831,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1832,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,Hamlet (Amlethus) is sent by the king of Britain to woo this maiden for
1833,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,him: but she causes Hamlet's shield and the commission to be stolen while
1834,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,he sleeps: she learns from the shield that the messenger is the famous and
1835,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"valiant Hamlet, and alters the commission so that her hand is requested,"
1836,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"not for the king of Britain, but for Hamlet himself. With this request she"
1837,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"complies, and the wedding is celebrated. But when Wihtlæg (Vigletus)"
1838,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"conquers and slays Hamlet, she weds the conqueror, thus becoming ancestress"
1839,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,of Offa.
1840,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1841,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,{40}
1842,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,
1843,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,It may well be that there is some connection between the Thryth of
1844,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,_Beowulf_ and the Hermuthruda who in Saxo weds Offa's ancestor--that they
1845,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,are both types of the wild maiden who becomes a submissive though not
1846,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"always happy wife. If so, the continued wickedness of Drida in the _Life of"
1847,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"Offa II_ would be an alteration of the original story, made in order to"
1848,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,"exonerate Offa II from the deeds of murder which, as a matter of history,"
1849,SECTION VII. KING OFFA.,did characterize his reign.

1875,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,
1876,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Now ""Beowulf"" is an exceedingly rare name. The presence of the earlier"
1877,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Beowulf, Scyld's son, seems then to demand explanation, and many critics,"
1878,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"working on quite different lines, have arrived independently at the"
1879,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"conclusion that either the story of Grendel and his mother, or the story of"
1880,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"the dragon, or both stories, were originally told of the son of Scyld, and"
1881,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,only afterwards transferred to the Geatic hero. This has indeed been
1882,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"generally accepted, almost from the beginning of {42} Beowulf"
1883,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"criticism[83]. Yet, though possible enough, it does not admit of any"
1884,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,demonstration.
1885,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,
1886,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Now Beowulf, son of Scyld, clearly corresponds to a Beow or Beaw in the"
1887,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,West Saxon genealogy. In this genealogy Beow is always connected with Scyld
1888,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"and Scef, and in some versions the relations are identical with those given"
1889,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"in _Beowulf_: Beow, son of Scyld, son of Scef, in the genealogies[84],"
1890,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"corresponding to Beowulf, son of Scyld Scefing, in our poem. Hence arose"
1891,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,the further speculation of many scholars that the hero who slays the
1892,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"monsters was originally called, not Beowulf, but Beow, and that he was"
1893,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"identical with the hero in the West Saxon pedigree; in other words, that"
1894,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,the original story was of a hero Beow (son of Scyld) who slew a monster and
1895,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,a dragon: and that this adventure was only subsequently transferred to
1896,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Beowulf, prince of the Geatas."
1897,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,
1898,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"This is a theory based upon a theory, and some confirmation may reasonably"
1899,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"be asked, before it is entertained. As to the dragon-slaying, the"
1900,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,confirmatory evidence is open to extreme doubt. It is dealt with in Section
1901,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"VII (Beowulf-Frotho), below. As to Grendel, one such piece of confirmation"
1902,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,there is. The conquering Angles and Saxons seem to have given the names of
1903,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,their heroes to the lands they won in England: some such names--'Wade's
1904,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"causeway,' 'Weyland's smithy'--have survived to modern times. The evidence"
1905,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,of the Anglo-Saxon charters shows that very many which have now been lost
1906,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,existed in England prior to the Conquest. Now in a Wiltshire charter of the
1907,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"year 931, we have _B[=e]owan hammes hecgan_ mentioned not far from a"
1908,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,_Grendles mere_. This has been claimed as evidence that the story of
1909,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Grendel, with Beow as his adversary, was localized in Wiltshire in the"
1910,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"reign of Athelstan, and perhaps had been localized there since the"
1911,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,settlement four centuries previously. Until recently this was accepted as
1912,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,definitely {43} proving that the Beowulf-Grendel story was derived from an
1913,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,ancient Beow-myth. Yet one such instance of name-association is not
1914,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,conclusive. We cannot leave out of consideration the possibility of its
1915,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"being a mere chance coincidence, especially considering how large is the"
1916,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"number of place names recorded in Old English charters. Of late, people"
1917,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"have become more sceptical in drawing inferences from proper names, and"
1918,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,quite recently there has been a tendency entirely to overlook the evidence
1919,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"of the charter, by way of making compensation for having hitherto overrated"
1920,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,it.
1921,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,
1922,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,All that can be said with certainty is that it _is_ remarkable that a place
1923,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,named after Beowa should be found in the immediate proximity of a
1924,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"""Grendel's lake,"" and that this fact supports the possibility, though it"
1925,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"assuredly does not prove, that in the oldest versions of the tale the"

1956,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,
1957,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,The answer surely is that the occurrence of the two names together in
1958,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"the charter would, by itself, give no basis whatever for starting such"
1959,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"a theory: but if, on other grounds, the theory were likely, then the"
1960,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,occurrence of the two names together would certainly have some
1961,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"corroborative value. Exactly how much, it is impossible to say, because"
1962,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"we cannot estimate the element of chance, and we cannot {44} be certain"
1963,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,that the _grendel_ and the _beowa_ mentioned are identical with our

1965,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,
1966,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Miller has argued [_Academy_, May 1894, p. 396] that _grendles_ is not"
1967,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"a proper name here, but a common noun signifying ""drain,"" and that"
1968,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"_grendles mere_ therefore means ""cesspool."""
1969,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,
1970,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Now ""grindle"" is found in modern dialect and even in Middle English[85]"
1971,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"in the sense of ""a narrow ditch"" or ""gutter,"" but I doubt if it can be"

1973,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,being an East Anglian corruption of the much more widely spread
1974,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"_drindle_, or _dringle_, used both as a verb ""to go slowly, to"
1975,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"trickle,"" and as ""a small trickling stream."" And even if an O.E."
1976,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"_grendel_ as a common noun meaning ""gutter"" were authenticated, it"
1977,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"seems unlikely to me that places were named ""the fen,"" ""the mere,"" ""the"

1979,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"supposing the existence of an O.E. _grendel_ = ""sewer,"" or anything"
1980,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,which would lead us to suppose _grendles mere_ or _gryndeles sylle_ to
1981,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"mean ""cesspool[86]."" Surely it is probable, knowing what we do of the"
1982,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,way in which the English settlers gave epic names to the localities
1983,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"around their settlements, that these places were named after Grendel"
1984,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,because they seemed the sort of place where his story might be

1988,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Again, both Panzer and Lawrence suggest that the Beowa who gave his"

1994,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,of these heroes of the genealogies[87]?
1995,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,
1996,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Recent scepticism as to the ""Beow-myth"" has been largely due to the fact"
1997,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"that speculation as to Beow had been carried too far. For example, because"
1998,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Beow appeared in the West Saxon genealogy, it had been assumed that the"
1999,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,Beow-myth belonged essentially to the Angles and Saxons. Yet Beow would
2000,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,seem to have been also known among Scandinavians. For in somewhat later
2001,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"days Scandinavian genealogists, when they had made the acquaintance of the"
2002,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Anglo-Saxon pedigrees, noted that Beow had a Scandinavian counterpart in a"
2003,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,hero whom they called Bjar[88]. That something was known in the north of
2004,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"this Bjar is proved by the _Kálfsvísa_, that same catalogue of famous"
2005,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,heroes and their horses which we have already found giving us the
2006,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,counterparts of Onela and Eadgils. Yet this dry reference serves to show
2007,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,that Bjar must once have been sufficiently famous to have a horse specially
2008,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,his own[89]. Whether the fourteenth century Scandinavian who made Bjar the
2009,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Northern equivalent of Beow was merely guessing, we unfortunately cannot"
2010,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"tell. Most probably he was, for there is reason to think that the hero"
2011,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"corresponding to Beow was named, not _Bjár_, but _Byggvir_[90]: a"
2012,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,correspondence intelligible to modern philologists as in agreement with
2013,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"phonetic law, but naturally not obvious to an Icelandic genealogist. But"
2014,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"however this may be, the assumption that Beow was peculiarly the hero of"
2015,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,Angles and Saxons seems hardly justified.

2017,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,{46}
2018,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,
2019,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Again, since Beow is an ancestor of Woden, it was further assumed that he"
2020,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"was an ancient god, and that in the story of his adventures we had to deal"
2021,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,with a nature-myth of a divine deliverer who saved the people from Grendel
2022,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"and his mother, the personified powers of the stormy sea. It is with the"
2023,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"name of Müllenhoff, its most enthusiastic and ablest advocate, that this"
2024,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"""mythological theory"" is particularly associated. That Grendel is"
2025,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"fictitious no one, of course, would deny. But Müllenhoff and his school, in"
2026,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"applying the term ""mythical"" to those portions of the _Beowulf_ story for"
2027,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"which no historical explanation could be found, meant that they enshrined"
2028,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,_nature-myths_. They thought that those elements in heroic poetry which
2029,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,could not be referred back to actual fact must be traced to ancient stories
2030,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,in which were recorded the nation's belief about the sun and the gods:
2031,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,about storms and seasons.
2032,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,
2033,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,The different mythological explanations of Beowulf-Beowa and Grendel have
2034,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,depended mainly upon hazardous etymological explanations of the hero's
2035,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,name. The most popular is Müllenhoff's interpretation. Beaw is the divine
2036,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,helper of man in his struggle with the elements. Grendel represents the
2037,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"stormy North Sea of early spring, flooding and destroying the habitations"
2038,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"of men, till the god rescues them: Grendel's mother represents the depths"
2039,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,of the ocean. But in the autumn the power of the god wanes: the dragon
2040,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,personifies the coming of the wild weather: the god sinks in his final
2041,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,struggle to safeguard the treasures of the earth for his people[91].
2042,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Others, remembering that Grendel dwells in the fen, see in him rather a"
2043,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,demon of the sea-marsh than of the sea itself: he is the pestilential
2044,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"swamp[92], and the hero a wind which drives him away[93]. Or, whilst"
2045,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Grendel still represents the storms, his antagonist is a ""Blitzheros[94]."""
2046,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Others, whilst hardly ranking Beowulf as {47} a god, still see an allegory"
2047,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"in his adventures, and Grendel must be a personification either of an"
2048,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"inundation[95], or of the terror of the long winter nights[96], or possibly"
2049,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"of grinding at the mill, the work of the enslaved foe[97]."
2050,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,
2051,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,Such explanations were till recently universally current: the instances

2054,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,Sufficient allowance was not made for the influence upon heroic poetry of

2059,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,"Though this is assuredly to go too far, it is but reasonable to recognize"

2066,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,giant-killers and dragon-slayers have been current among the people of

2071,SECTION I. THE GRENDEL FIGHT.,Those students who of late years have tried thus to elucidate the story of

2117,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,
2118,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,Grettir conjectures that the two missing men must have been pulled by the

2124,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"his feet, and then knew no more what had become of him."" Grettir swims"
2125,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"under the fall and gets into the cave, where he sees a giant sitting by a"
2126,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,fire: the giant aims a blow at him with a weapon with a wooden handle
2127,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"(""such a weapon men then called a _hefti-sax_""). Grettir hews it asunder."
2128,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"The giant then grasps at another sword hanging on the wall of the cave, but"
2129,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"before he can use it Grettir wounds him. Stein, the priest, seeing the"
2130,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"water stained with blood from this wound, concludes that Grettir is dead,"
2131,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"and departs home, lamenting the loss of such a man. ""But Grettir let little"

2135,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"no reply, and he has to climb up, unaided. He leaves the bones in the"
2136,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"church porch, for the confusion of the priest, who has to admit that he has"
2137,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,failed to do his part faithfully.
2138,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,
2139,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"Now if we compare this with _Beowulf_, we see that in the Icelandic story"
2140,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"much is different: for example, in the _Grettis saga_ it is the female"
2141,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"monster who raids the habitation of men, the male who stays at home in his"
2142,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,den. In this the _Grettis saga_ probably represents a corrupt tradition:
2143,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"for, that the female should remain at home whilst the male searches for his"
2144,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"prey, is a rule which holds good for devils as well as for men[100]. {50}"
2145,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,The change was presumably made in order to avoid the difficulty--which the
2146,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,_Beowulf_ poet seems also to have realized--that after the male has been
2147,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"slain, the rout of the female is felt to be a deed of less note--something"

2161,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,
2162,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,Now obviously such a series of resemblances cannot be the result of an
2163,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,accident. Either the _Grettir_-story is derived directly or indirectly from
2164,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"the _Beowulf_ epic, more or less as we have it, or both stories are derived"
2165,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,from one common earlier source. The scholars who first discovered the

2167,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,original[103]. This view has generally been endorsed by later
2168,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"investigators, but not universally[104]. And this is one of the questions"
2169,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"which the student cannot leave open, because our view of the origin of the"
2170,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,_Grendel_-story will have to depend largely upon the view we take as to its
2171,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,connection with the episode in the _Grettis saga_.
2172,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,
2173,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"If this episode be derived from _Beowulf_, then we have an interesting"

2180,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,
2181,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,The evidence seems to me to support strongly the view of the majority of
2182,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,scholars--that the _Grettir_-episode is not derived from _Beowulf_ in the

2186,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,It is certain that the story of the monster invading a dwelling of men and

2190,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"therefore we find it existing, independently of its Danish setting, the"
2191,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,presumption is in favour of this being a survival of the old independent
2192,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,story. Of course it is _conceivable_ that the Hrothgar-Heorot setting might

2194,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"trace of it remains. But it seems going out of our way to assume this,"
2195,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,unless we are forced to do so[105].
2196,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,
2197,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"Again, it is certain that these stories--like all the subject matter of the"
2198,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"Old English epic--did not originate in England, but were brought across the"

2203,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"also have been current in Scandinavia, and thence have been carried to"
2204,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,Iceland.
2205,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,
2206,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,Other stories which were current in England in the eighth century were also
2207,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,current in Scandinavia in the thirteenth. Yet this does not mean that the

2211,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"alliterative line. Why then, contrary to all analogy, should we assume a"
2212,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,literary borrowing in the case of the _Beowulf-Grettir_-story? The compiler
2213,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,of the _Grettis saga_ could not possibly have drawn his material from a MS
2214,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,of _Beowulf_[106]: he could not have made sense of a single passage. He
2215,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,conceivably _might_ have drawn from traditions _derived_ from the Old
2216,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,English epic. But it is difficult to see how. Long before his time these
2217,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,traditions had for the most part been forgotten in England itself. One of

2219,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,England at the beginning of the thirteenth century. That a Scandinavian

2221,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,with Anglo-Saxon epic tradition seems on the whole unlikely. The
2222,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"Scandinavian tradition of Offa, scholars are now agreed[107], was not"
2223,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"borrowed from England, and there is no reason why we should assume such"
2224,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,borrowing in the case of Grettir.
2225,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,
2226,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"The probability is, then, considerable, that the _Beowulf_-story and the"

2229,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,And this probability would be confirmed to a certainty if we should find

2277,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"arguing, therefore, from any parallel, it must first be shown that the"
2278,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,feature in which Orm resembles {54} Beowulf is not derived at second hand
2279,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"from the _Grettis saga_. One such feature there is, namely Orm's piety,"
2280,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,which he certainly does not derive from Grettir. In this he with equal
2281,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"certainty resembles Beowulf. According to modern ideas, indeed, there is"
2282,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,more of the Christian hero in Beowulf than in Orm.
2283,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,
2284,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"Now Orm owes his victory to the fact, among other things, that, at the"

2286,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,pilgrimage to Rome should he be successful. In this a parallel is seen to
2287,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,"the fact that Beowulf is saved, not only by his coat of mail, but also by"
2288,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,the divine interposition[114]. But is this really a parallel? Beowulf is
2289,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,too much of a sportsman to buy victory by making a vow when in a tight
2290,SECTION II. THE SCANDINAVIAN PARALLELS--GRETTIR AND ORM.,place. _G[=æ]ð [=a] wyrd sw[=a] h[=i]o scel_[115] is the exact antithesis

2314,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2315,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"We have seen that there are in _Beowulf_ two distinct elements, which never"
2316,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,seem quite harmonized: firstly the historic background of the Danish and
2317,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Geatic courts, with their chieftains, Hrothgar and Hrothulf, or Hrethel and"
2318,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,Hygelac: and secondly the old wives' fables of struggles with ogres and
2319,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"dragons. In the story of Grettir, the ogre fable appears--unmistakably"
2320,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"connected with the similar story as given in _Beowulf_, but with {55} no"
2321,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,faintest trace of having ever possessed any Danish heroic setting.
2322,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2323,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Turning back to the _Saga of Rolf Kraki_, we _do_ find against that Danish"
2324,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"setting a figure, that of the hero Bothvar Bjarki, bearing a very"
2325,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,remarkable resemblance to Beowulf.
2326,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2327,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Bjarki, bent on adventure, leaves the land of the Gautar (Götar), where his"
2328,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"brother is king, and reaches Leire, where Rolf, the king of the Danes,"
2329,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"holds his court; [just as Beowulf, bent on adventure, leaves the land of"
2330,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"the Geatas (Götar) where his uncle is king, and reaches Heorot, where"
2331,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,Hrothgar and Hrothulf (Rolf) hold court].
2332,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2333,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Arrived at Leire, Bjarki takes under his protection the despised coward"
2334,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Hott, whom Rolf's retainers have been wont to bully. The champions at the"
2335,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Danish court [in _Beowulf_ one of them only--Unferth] prove quarrelsome,"
2336,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"and they assail the hero during the feast, in the _Saga_ by throwing bones"
2337,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"at him, in _Beowulf_ only by bitter words. The hero in each case replies,"
2338,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"in kind, with such effect that the enemy is silenced."
2339,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2340,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"But despite the fame and splendour of the Danish court, it has long been"
2341,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,subject to the attacks of a strange monster[116]--a winged beast whom no
2342,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,iron will bite [just as Grendel is immune from swords[117]]. Bjarki [like
2343,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,Beowulf[118]] is scornful at the inability of the Danes to defend their own
2344,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"home: ""if one beast can lay waste the kingdom and the cattle of the king."""
2345,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"He goes out to fight with the monster _by night_, accompanied only by Hott."
2346,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"He tries to draw his sword, but the sword is fast in its sheath: he tugs,"
2347,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"the sword comes out, and he slays the beast with it. This seems a most"
2348,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,pointless incident: taken in connection with the supposed invulnerability
2349,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"of the foe, it looks like the survival of some episode in which the hero"
2350,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,was unwilling [as in Beowulf's fight with Grendel[119]] or unable [as in
2351,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,Beowulf's fight with Grendel's mother[120]] to slay the foe {56} with his
2352,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,sword. Bjarki then compels the terrified coward Hott to drink the monster's
2353,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"blood. Hott forthwith becomes a valiant champion, second only to Bjarki"
2354,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,himself. The beast is then propped up as if still alive: when it is seen
2355,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"next morning the king calls upon his retainers to play the man, and Bjarki"
2356,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,tells Hott that now is the time to clear his reputation. Hott demands first
2357,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"the sword, Gullinhjalti, from Rolf, and with this he slays the dead beast a"
2358,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,second time. King Rolf is not deceived by this trick; yet he rejoices that
2359,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Bjarki has not only himself slain the monster, but changed the cowardly"
2360,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Hott into a champion; he commands that Hott shall be called Hjalti, after"
2361,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,the sword which has been given him. We are hardly justified in demanding
2362,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"logic in a wild tale like this, or one might ask how Rolf was convinced of"
2363,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,Hott's valour by what he knew to be a piece of stage management on the part
2364,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"of Bjarki. But, however that may be, it is remarkable that in _Beowulf_"
2365,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"also the monster Grendel, though proof against all ordinary weapons, is"
2366,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,smitten _when dead_ by a magic sword of which the _golden hilt_[121] is
2367,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,specially mentioned.
2368,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2369,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"In addition to the undeniable similarity of the stories of these heroes, a"
2370,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,certain similarity of name has been claimed. That _Bjarki_ is not
2371,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,etymologically connected with _B[=e]owulf_ or _B[=e]ow_ is clear: but if we
2372,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"are to accept the identification of Beowulf and Beow, remembering that the"
2373,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Scandinavian equivalent of the latter is said to be _Bjár_, the resemblance"
2374,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,to _Bjarki_ is obvious. Similarity of sound might have caused one name to
2375,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,be substituted for another[122]. This argument obviously depends upon the
2376,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"identification _B[=e]ow_ = _Bjár_, which is extremely doubtful: it will be"
2377,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,argued below that it is more likely that _B[=e]ow_ = _Byggvir_[123].
2378,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2379,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,But force remains in the argument that the name Bjarki (little bear) is
2380,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"very appropriate to a hero like the Beowulf of {57} our epic, who crushes"
2381,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,or hugs his foe to death instead of using his sword; even if we do not
2382,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"accept explanations which would interpret the name ""Beowulf"" itself as a"
2383,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"synonym for ""Bear."""
2384,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2385,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"It is scarcely to be wondered at, then, that most critics have seen in"
2386,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,Bjarki a Scandinavian parallel to Beowulf. But serious difficulties remain.
2387,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,There is in the Scandinavian story a mass of detail quite unparallelled in
2388,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"_Beowulf_, which overshadows the resemblances. Bjarki's friendship, for"
2389,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"example, with the coward Hott or Hjalti has no counterpart in _Beowulf_."
2390,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"And Bjarki becomes a retainer of King Rolf and dies in his service, whilst"
2391,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,Beowulf never comes into direct contact with Hrothulf at all; the poet
2392,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"seems to avoid naming them together. Still, it is quite intelligible that"
2393,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,the story should have developed on different lines in Scandinavia from
2394,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"those which it followed in England, till the new growths overshadowed the"
2395,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"original resemblance, without obliterating it. After nearly a thousand"
2396,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,years of independent development discrepancies must be expected. It would
2397,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,not be a reasonable objection to the identity of _Gullinhjalti_ with
2398,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"_Gyldenhilt_, that the word _hilt_ had grown to have a rather different"
2399,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,meaning in Norse and in English; subsequent developments do not invalidate
2400,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,an original resemblance if the points of contact are really there.
2401,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2402,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"But, allowing for this independent growth in Scandinavia, we should"
2403,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,naturally expect that the further back we traced the story the greater the
2404,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,resemblance would become.
2405,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2406,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"This brings us to the second, serious difficulty: that, when we turn from"
2407,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,the _Saga of Rolf Kraki_--belonging in its present form perhaps to the
2408,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"early fifteenth century--to the pages of Saxo Grammaticus, who tells the"
2409,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"same tale more than two centuries earlier, the resemblance, instead of"
2410,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"becoming stronger, almost vanishes. Nothing is said of Bjarki coming from"
2411,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Gautland, or indeed of his being a stranger at the Danish court: nothing is"
2412,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"said of the monster having paid previous visits, visits repeated till king"
2413,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Rolf, like Hrothgar, has to give up all attempt at resistance, and submit"
2414,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"to its depredations. The monster, instead of being a troll, like Grendel,"
2415,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"becomes a commonplace bear. All Saxo tells us is that ""He [Biarco, i.e."
2416,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Bjarki] met a great bear in a thicket and slew it with a spear, and bade"
2417,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,his {58} comrade Ialto [i.e. Hjalti] place his lips to the beast and drink
2418,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"its blood as it flowed, that he might become stronger."""
2419,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2420,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Hence the Danish scholar, Axel Olrik, in the best and most elaborate"
2421,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"discussion of Bjarki and all about him, has roundly denied any connection"
2422,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,between his hero and Beowulf. He is astonished at the slenderness of the
2423,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,evidence upon which previous students have argued for relationship.
2424,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"""Neither Beowulf's wrestling match in the hall, nor in the fen, nor his"
2425,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"struggle with the firedrake has any real identity, but when we take a"
2426,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,little of them all we can get a kind of similarity with the latest and
2427,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"worst form of the Bjarki saga[124]."" The development of Saxo's bear into a"
2428,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"winged monster, ""the worst of trolls,"" Olrik regards as simply in"
2429,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"accordance with the usual heightening, in later Icelandic, of these early"
2430,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"stories of struggles with beasts, and of this he gives a parallel instance."
2431,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2432,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Some Icelandic ballads on Bjarki (the _Bjarka rímur_), which were first"
2433,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"printed in 1904, were claimed by Olrik as supporting his contention. These"
2434,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"ballads belong to about the year 1400. Yet, though they are thus in date"
2435,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,and dialect closely allied to the _Saga of Rolf Kraki_ and remote from Saxo
2436,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Grammaticus, they are so far from supporting the tradition of the _Saga_"
2437,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"with regard to the monster slain, that they represent the foe first as a"
2438,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"man-eating she-wolf, which is slain by Bjarki, then as a grey bear [as in"
2439,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Saxo], which is slain by Hjalti after he has been compelled to drink the"
2440,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,blood of the she-wolf. We must therefore give up the winged beast as mere
2441,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,later elaboration; for if the Bjarki ballads in a point like this support
2442,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Saxo, as against the _Saga_ which is so closely connected with them by its"
2443,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"date and Icelandic tongue, we must admit Saxo's version here to represent,"
2444,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"beyond dispute, the genuine tradition."
2445,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2446,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,Accordingly the attempt which has been made to connect Bjarki's winged
2447,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,monster with Beowulf's winged dragon goes overboard at once. But such an
2448,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,attempt ought never to have been made at all. The parallel is between
2449,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Bjarki and the Beowulf-Grendel episode, not between Bjarki and the"
2450,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Beowulf-dragon episode, which ought to be left out of consideration. And"
2451,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,the monstrous bear and the wolf of the _Rímur_ are not so {59} dissimilar
2452,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"from Grendel, with his bear-like hug, and Grendel's mother, the"
2453,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,'sea-wolf[125].'
2454,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2455,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"The likeness between Beowulf and Bjarki lies, not in the wingedness or"
2456,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"otherwise of the monsters they overthrow, but in the similarity of the"
2457,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"position--in the situation which places the most famous court of the North,"
2458,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"and its illustrious king, at the mercy of a ravaging foe, till a chance"
2459,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"stranger from Gautland brings deliverance. And here the _Rímur_ support,"
2460,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"not Saxo, but the _Saga_, though in an outworn and faded way. In the"
2461,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,_Rímur_ Bjarki is a stranger come from abroad: the bear has made previous
2462,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,attacks upon the king's folds.
2463,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2464,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Thus, whilst we grant the wings of the beast to be a later elaboration, it"
2465,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,does not in the least follow that other features in which the _Saga_
2466,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"differs from Saxo--the advent of Bjarki from Gautland, for instance--are"
2467,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,also later elaboration.
2468,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2469,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,And we must be careful not to attach too much weight to the account of Saxo
2470,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,merely because it is earlier in date than that of the _Saga_. The
2471,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"presumption is, of course, that the earlier form will be the more original:"
2472,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"but just as a late manuscript will often preserve, amidst its corruptions,"
2473,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"features which are lost in much earlier manuscripts, so will a tradition."
2474,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Saxo's accounts are often imperfect[126]. And in this particular instance,"
2475,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"there is a want of coherency and intelligibility in Saxo's account, which"
2476,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,in itself affords a strong presumption that it _is_ imperfect.
2477,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2478,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,What Saxo tells us is this:
2479,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2480,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"At which banquet, when the champions were rioting with every kind of"
2481,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"wantonness, and flinging knuckle-bones at a certain Ialto [Hjalti] from"
2482,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"all sides, it happened that his messmate Biarco [Bjarki] through the"
2483,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"bad aim of the thrower received a severe blow on the head. But Biarco,"
2484,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"equally annoyed by the injury and the insult, sent the bone back to the"
2485,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"thrower, so that he twisted the front of his head to the back and the"
2486,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"back to the front, punishing the cross-grain of the man's temper by"
2487,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,turning his face round about.
2488,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2489,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"But who were this ""certain Hjalti"" and Bjarki? There seems to be something"
2490,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"missing in the story. The explanation [which Saxo does not give us, but the"
2491,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,_Saga_ does] that Bjarki has come from afar and taken the despised
2492,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Hott-Hjalti under his {60} protection, seems to be necessary. Why was"
2493,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Hjalti chosen as the victim, at whom missiles were to be discharged?"
2494,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Obviously [though Saxo does not tell us so], because he was the butt of the"
2495,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"mess. And if Bjarki had been one of the mess for many hours, his messmates"
2496,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,would have known him too well to throw knuckle-bones either at him or his
2497,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"friend. This is largely a matter of personal feeling, but Saxo's account"
2498,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"seems to me pointless, till it is supplemented from the _Saga_[127]."
2499,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2500,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2501,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2502,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,And there is one further piece of evidence which seems to clinch the whole
2503,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"matter finally, though its importance has been curiously overlooked, by"
2504,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Panzer and Lawrence in their arguments for the identification, and by Olrik"
2505,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,in his arguments to the contrary.
2506,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2507,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"We have seen above how Beowulf ""became a friend"" to Eadgils, helping him in"
2508,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"his expedition against King Onela of Sweden, and avenging, in ""chill raids"
2509,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"fraught with woe,"" _cealdum cears[=i]ðum_, the wrongs which Onela had"
2510,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"inflicted upon the Geatas. We saw, too, that this expedition was remembered"
2511,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"in Scandinavian tradition. ""They had a battle on the ice of Lake Wener;"
2512,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"there King Ali fell, and Athils had the victory. Concerning this battle"
2513,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"there is much said in the _Skjoldunga saga_."" The _Skjoldunga saga_ is"
2514,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"lost, but the Latin extracts from it give some information about this"
2515,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"battle[128]. Further, an account of it _is_ preserved in the _Bjarka"
2516,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"rímur_, probably derived from the lost _Skjoldunga saga_. And the _Bjarka"
2517,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,rímur_ expressly mention Bjarki as helping Athils in this battle against
2518,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,Ali on the ice of Lake Wener[129].
2519,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2520,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Olrik does not seem to allow for this at all, though of course aware of it."
2521,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,The other parallels between Bjarki and Beowulf he believes to be mere
2522,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,coincidence. But is this likely?
2523,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2524,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,To recapitulate: In old English tradition a hero comes from the land of the
2525,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Geatas to the royal court of Denmark, where Hrothgar and Hrothulf hold"
2526,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,sway. This hero is received in none too friendly wise by one of the
2527,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"retainers, but {61} puts his foe to shame, is warmly welcomed by the king,"
2528,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,and slays by night a monster which has been attacking the Danish capital
2529,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,and against which the warriors of that court have been helpless. The
2530,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"monster is proof against all swords, yet its dead body is mutilated by a"
2531,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,sword with a golden hilt. Subsequently this same hero helps King Eadgils of
2532,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,Sweden to overthrow Onela.
2533,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2534,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,We find precisely the same situation in Icelandic tradition some seven
2535,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"centuries later, except that not Hrothgar and Hrothulf, but Hrothulf (Rolf)"
2536,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"alone is represented as ruling the Danes, and the sword with the golden"
2537,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"hilt has become a sword named ""Golden-hilt."" It is _conceivable_ for a"
2538,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"situation to have been reconstructed in this way by mere accident, just as"
2539,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,it is conceivable that one player may have the eight or nine best trumps
2540,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"dealt him. But it does not seem advisable to base one's calculations, as"
2541,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Olrik does, upon such an accident happening."
2542,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,
2543,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,The parallel of Bjarki and Beowulf seems to have been first noted by
2544,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Gisli Brynjulfsson (_Antiquarisk Tidsskrift_, 1852-3, p. 130). It has"
2545,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"been often discussed by Sarrazin (_Beowulf Studien_, 13 _etc._, 47:"
2546,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"_Anglia_, IX, 195 _etc._: _Engl. Stud._ XVI, 79 _etc._, XXIII, 242"
2547,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"_etc._, XXXV, 19 _etc._). Sarrazin's over-elaborated parallels form a"
2548,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"broad target for doubters: it must be remembered that a case, though it"
2549,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"may be discredited, is not invalidated by exaggeration. The problem is"
2550,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"of course noted in the Beowulf studies of Müllenhoff (55), Bugge"
2551,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"(_P.B.B._ XII, 55) and Boer (_Die Beowulfsage_, II, in _Arkiv f. nord."
2552,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"filol._ XIX, 44 _etc._) and discussed at length and convincingly by"
2553,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"Panzer (364-386) and Lawrence (_Pub. Mod. Lang. Assoc. Amer._ XXIV,"
2554,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"1909, 222 _etc._). The usual view which accepts some relationship is"
2555,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"endorsed by all these scholars, as it is by Finnur Jónsson in his"
2556,SECTION III. BOTHVAR BJARKI.,"edition of the _Hrólfs Saga Kraka og Bjarkarímur_ (København, 1904, p."

2579,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,Hitherto we have been dealing with parallels to the Grendel story in
2580,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"written literature: but a further series of parallels, although much more"
2581,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"remote, is to be found in that vast store of old wives' tales which no one"
2582,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"till the nineteenth century took the trouble to write down systematically,"
2583,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"but which certainly go back to a very ancient period. One particular tale,"
2584,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"that of the Bear's Son[130] (extant in many forms), has been instanced as"
2585,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"showing a resemblance to the _Beowulf_-story. In this tale the hero, a"
2586,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"young man of extraordinary strength, (1) sets out on his adventures,"
2587,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,associating with himself various companions; (2) makes resistance in a
2588,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"house against a supernatural being, which his fellows have in vain striven"
2589,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"to withstand, and succeeds in mishandling or mutilating him. (3) By the"
2590,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"blood-stained track of this creature, or guided by him in some other"
2591,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"manner, the hero finds his way to a spring, or hole in the earth, (4) is"
2592,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,lowered down by a cord and (5) overcomes in the underworld different
2593,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"supernatural foes, amongst whom is often included his former foe, or very"
2594,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,rarely the mother of that foe: victory can often only be gained by the use
2595,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,of a magic sword which the hero finds below. (6) The hero is left
2596,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"treacherously in the lurch by his companions, whose duty it was to have"
2597,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,drawn him up...
2598,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2599,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"Now it may be objected, with truth, that this is not like the"
2600,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"_Beowulf_-story, or even particularly like the _Grettir_-story. But the"
2601,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,question is not merely whether it resembles these stories as we possess
2602,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"them, but whether it resembles the story which must have been the common"
2603,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,origin of both. And we have only to try to reconstruct from _Beowulf_ and
2604,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,from the _Grettis saga_ a tale which can have been the common original of
2605,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"both, to see that it must be something extraordinarily like the folk-tale"
2606,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,outlined above.
2607,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2608,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,{63}
2609,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2610,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"For example, it is true that the departure of the Danes homeward because"
2611,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"they believe that Beowulf has met his death in the water below, bears only"
2612,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,the remotest resemblance to the deliberate treachery which the companions
2613,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,in the folk-tale mete out to the hero. But when we compare the
2614,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"_Grettir_-story, we see there that a real breach of trust is involved, for"
2615,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"there the priest Stein leaves the hero in the lurch, and abandons the rope"
2616,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,by which he should have drawn Grettir up. This can hardly be an innovation
2617,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"on the part of the composer of the _Grettis saga_, for he is quite well"
2618,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"disposed towards Stein, and has no motive for wantonly attributing"
2619,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"treachery to him. The innovation presumably lies in the _Beowulf_-story,"
2620,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,where Hrothgar and his court are depicted in such a friendly spirit that no
2621,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"disreputable act can be attributed to them, and consequently Hrothgar's"
2622,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,departure home must not be allowed in any way to imperil or inconvenience
2623,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,the hero. A comparison of the _Beowulf_-story with the _Grettir_-story
2624,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,leads then to the conclusion that in the oldest version those who remained
2625,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,above when the hero plunged below _were_ guilty of some measure of
2626,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,disloyalty in ceasing to watch for him. In other words we see that the
2627,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"further we track the _Beowulf_-story back, the more it comes to resemble"
2628,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,the folk-tale.
2629,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2630,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,And our belief that there is some connection between the folk-tale and the
2631,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"original of _Beowulf_ must be strengthened when we find that, by a"
2632,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"comparison of the folk-tale, we are able to explain features in _Beowulf_"
2633,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,which strike us as difficult and even absurd: precisely as when we turn to
2634,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,a study of Shakespeare's sources we often find the explanation of things
2635,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,that puzzle us: we see that the poet is dealing with an unmanageable
2636,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"source, which he cannot make quite plausible. For instance: when Grendel"
2637,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,enters Heorot he kills and eats the first of Beowulf's retinue whom he
2638,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,finds: no one tries to prevent him. The only explanation which the poet has
2639,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,to offer is that the retinue are all asleep[131]--strange somnolence on the
2640,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"part of men who are awaiting a hostile attack, which they expect will be"
2641,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,fatal to them all[132]. And Beowulf at any rate is not asleep. Yet he
2642,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,calmly watches whilst his henchman is {64} both killed and eaten: and
2643,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"apparently, but for the accident that the monster next tackles Beowulf"
2644,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"himself, he would have allowed his whole bodyguard to be devoured one after"
2645,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,another.
2646,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2647,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"But if we suppose the story to be derived from the folk-tale, we have an"
2648,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"explanation. For in the folk-tale, the companions and the hero await the"
2649,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"foe singly, in succession: the turn of the hero comes last, after all his"
2650,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"companions have been put to shame. But Beowulf, who is represented as"
2651,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"having specially voyaged to Heorot in order to purge it, cannot leave the"
2652,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,defence of the hall for the first night to one of his comrades. Hence the
2653,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,discomfiture of the comrade and the single-handed success of the hero have
2654,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,to be represented as simultaneous. The result is incongruous: Beowulf _has_
2655,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,to look on whilst his comrade is killed.
2656,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2657,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"Again, both Beowulf and Grettir plunge in the water with a sword, and with"
2658,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,the deliberate object of shedding the monster's blood. Why then should the
2659,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,watchers on the cliff above assume that the blood-stained water must
2660,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"necessarily signify the _hero's_ death, and depart home? Why did it never"
2661,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,occur to them that this deluge of blood might much more suitably proceed
2662,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,from the monster?
2663,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2664,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,But we can understand this unreason if we suppose that the story-teller had
2665,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"to start from the deliberate and treacherous departure of the companions,"
2666,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,whilst at the same time it was not to his purpose to represent the
2667,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,companions as treacherous. In that case some excuse _must_ be found for
2668,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,them: and the blood-stained water was the nearest at hand[133].
2669,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2670,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"Again, quite independently of the folk-tale, many _Beowulf_ scholars have"
2671,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,come to the conclusion that in the original version of the story the hero
2672,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,did not wait for a second attack from the mother of the monster he had
2673,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"slain, but rather, from a natural and laudable desire to complete his task,"
2674,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"followed the monster's tracks to the mere, and finished him and his mother"
2675,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,below. Many traits have survived which may conceivably point to an original
2676,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,version of the story in which Beowulf (or the figure corresponding to him)
2677,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,at once plunged down {65} in order to combat the foe corresponding to
2678,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,Grendel. There are unsatisfactory features in the story as it stands. For
2679,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"why, it might be urged, should the wrenching off of an arm have been fatal"
2680,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"to so tough a monster? And why, it has often been asked, is the adversary"
2681,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"under the water sometimes male, sometimes female? And why is it apparently"
2682,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"the blood of Grendel, not of his mother, which discolours the water and"
2683,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"burns up the sword, and the head of Grendel, not of his mother, which is"
2684,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"brought home in triumph? These arguments may not carry much weight, but at"
2685,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,any rate when we turn to the folk-tale we find that the adventure beneath
2686,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"the earth _is_ the natural following up of the adventure in the house, not"
2687,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,the result of any renewed attack.
2688,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2689,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2690,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2691,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"In addition, there are many striking coincidences between individual"
2692,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,versions or groups of the folk-tale on the one hand and the
2693,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,_Beowulf-Grettir_ story on the other: yet it is very difficult to know what
2694,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"value should be attached to these parallels, since there are many features"
2695,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,of popular story which float around and attach themselves to this or that
2696,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"tale without any original connection, so that it is easy for the same trait"
2697,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"to recur in _Beowulf_ and in a group of folk-tales, without this proving"
2698,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,that the stories as a whole are connected[134].
2699,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2700,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,The hero of the Bear's son folk-tale is often in his youth unmanageable or
2701,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,lazy. This is also emphasized in the stories both of Grettir and of Orm:
2702,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"and though such a feature was uncongenial to the courtly tone of _Beowulf_,"
2703,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"which sought to depict the hero as a model prince, yet it _is_ there[135],"
2704,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"even though only alluded to incidentally, and elsewhere ignored or even"
2705,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,denied[136].
2706,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2707,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"Again, the hero of the folk-tale is very frequently (but not necessarily)"
2708,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"either descended from a bear, nourished by a bear, or has some ursine"
2709,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,characteristic. We see this recurring in certain traits of Beowulf such as
2710,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,his bear-like method of hugging {66} his adversary to death. Here again the
2711,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,courtly poet has not emphasized his hero's wildness[137].
2712,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2713,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"Again, there are some extraordinary coincidences in names, between the"
2714,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,_Beowulf-Grettir_ story and the folk-tale. These are not found in _Beowulf_
2715,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"itself, but only in the stories of Grettir and Orm. Yet, as the"
2716,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,_Grettir_-episode is presumably derived from the same original as the
2717,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"_Beowulf_-episode, any _original_ connection between it and the folk-tale"
2718,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,involves such connection for _Beowulf_ also. We have seen that in _Grettis
2719,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"saga_ the priest Stein, as the unfaithful guardian of the rope which is to"
2720,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"draw up the hero, seems to represent the faithless companions of the"
2721,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"folktale. There is really no other way of accounting for him, for except on"
2722,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,this supposition he is quite otiose and unnecessary to the _Grettir_-story:
2723,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"the saga-man has no use for him. And his name confirms this explanation,"
2724,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,for in the folk-tale one of the three faithless companions of the hero is
2725,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"called the Stone-cleaver, _Steinhauer_, _Stenkløver_, or even, in one"
2726,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"Scandinavian version, simply _Stein_[138]."
2727,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2728,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"Again, the struggle in the _Grettis saga_ is localized at Sandhaugar in"
2729,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,Barthardal in Northern Iceland. Yet it is difficult to say why the
2730,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"saga-teller located the story there. The scenery, with the neighbouring"
2731,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"river and mighty waterfall, is fully described: but students of Icelandic"
2732,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,topography assert that the neighbourhood does _not_ at all lend itself to
2733,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,this description[139]. When we turn to the story of Orm we find it
2734,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,localized on the island Sandey. We are forced to the conclusion that the
2735,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"name belongs to the story, and that in some early version this was"
2736,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"localized at a place called Sandhaug, perhaps at one of the numerous places"
2737,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,in Norway of that name. Now turning to one of the Scandinavian versions of
2738,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"the folk-tale, we find that the descent into the earth and the consequent"
2739,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,struggle is localized in _en stor sandhaug_[140].
2740,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2741,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,{67}
2742,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2743,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"On the other hand, it must be remembered that if a collection is made of"
2744,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"some two hundred folk-tales, it is bound to contain, in addition to the"
2745,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"essential kernel of common tradition, a vast amount of that floating"
2746,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,material which tends to associate itself with this or that hero of story.
2747,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,Individual versions or groups of versions of the tale may contain features
2748,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"which occur also in the _Grendel_-story, without that being any evidence"
2749,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,for primitive connection. Thus we are told how Grendel forces open the door
2750,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,of Heorot. In a Sicilian version of the folk-tale the doors spring open of
2751,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"themselves as the foe appears. This has been claimed as a parallel. But, as"
2752,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"a sceptic has observed, the extraordinary thing is that of so slight a"
2753,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,similarity (if it is entitled to be called a similarity) we should find
2754,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"only one example out of two hundred, and have to go to Sicily for"
2755,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,that[141].
2756,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2757,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"The parallel between the _Beowulf_-story and the ""Bear's son"" folk-tale"
2758,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"had been noted by Laistner (_Das Rätsel der Sphinx_, Berlin, 1889, II,"
2759,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,22 _etc._): but the prevalent belief that the _Beowulf_-story was a
2760,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,nature-myth seems to have prevented further investigation on these
2761,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,lines till Panzer independently (p. 254) undertook his monumental work.
2762,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2763,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,Yet there are other features in the folk-tale which are entirely
2764,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,unrepresented in the _Beowulf-Grettir_ story. The hero of the folk-tale
2765,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,rescues captive princesses in the underworld (it is because they wish to
2766,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,rob him of this prize that his companions leave him below); he is saved by
2767,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"some miraculous helper, and finally, after adopting a disguise, puts his"
2768,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,treacherous comrades to shame and weds the youngest princess. None of these
2769,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"elements[142] are to be found in the stories of Beowulf, Grettir, Orm or"
2770,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"Bjarki, yet they are essential to the fairy tale[143]."

2772,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,{68}
2773,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,
2774,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,So that to speak of _Beowulf_ as a version of the fairy tale is undoubtedly
2775,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"going too far. All we can say is that some early story-teller took, from"
2776,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"folk-tale, those elements which suited his purpose, and that a tale,"
2777,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"containing many leading features found in the ""Bear's son"" story, but"
2778,SECTION IV. PARALLELS FROM FOLKLORE.,"omitting many of the leading motives of that story, came to be told of"

2888,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Note here, firstly, that the story is told, not of Scyld Scefing, but of"

2895,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"can judge from Ethelwerd's dry summary, entirely warlike: Scef is"
2896,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,surrounded by weapons.

2906,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
2907,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"William of Malmesbury was, of course, aware of Ethelwerd's account, and may"
2908,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,have been influenced by it. Some of his variations may be his own
2909,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,invention. The substitution of the classical form _Scandza_ for Ethelwerd's
2910,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"_Scani_ is simply a change from popular to learned nomenclature, and"
2911,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,enables the historian to show that he has read something of Jordanes. The
2912,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"alteration by which Malmesbury makes Sceaf, when grown up, rule at"
2913,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Schleswig in ancient Angel, may again be his own work--a variant added in"

2915,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
2916,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"But William of Malmesbury was, as we shall see later, prone to incorporate"
2917,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"current ballads into his history, and after allowing for what he may have"
2918,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"derived from Ethelwerd, and what he may have invented, there can be no"
2919,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,doubt that many of the additional details which he gives are genuine
2920,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"popular poetry. Indeed, whilst the story of Scyld's _funeral_ is very"
2921,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"impressive in _Beowulf_, it is in William's narrative that the story of the"
2922,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,child coming over the sea first becomes poetic.
2923,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
2924,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Now since even the English historians connected this tale with the Danish
2925,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"territory of _Scani, Scandza_, we should expect to find it again on turning"
2926,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"to the records of the Danish royal house. And we do find there, generally"
2927,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"at the head of the pedigree[148], a hero--Skjold--whose name corresponds,"
2928,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,and whose relationship to the later Danish kings shows him to be the same
2929,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"as the _Scyld Scefing_ of _Beowulf_. But neither Saxo Grammaticus, nor any"
2930,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"other Danish historian, knows anything of {72} Skjold having come in his"

2932,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,

2937,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"weighty, for presumably the spoils which the hero brings with him from the"
2938,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"unknown, or takes back thither, are in harmony with his career. _Beowulf_"
2939,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"and Ethelwerd seem to show the warrior king, William of Malmesbury seems"
2940,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"rather to be telling the story of a semi-divine foundling, who introduces"
2941,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,the tillage of the earth[149].
2942,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
2943,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"In _Beowulf_ the child is Scyld Scefing, in Ethelwerd and William of"
2944,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Malmesbury he is Sceaf, father of Scyld."
2945,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
2946,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"_Beowulf_, Ethelwerd and William of Malmesbury agree in connecting the"

2948,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,_Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ all make Sceaf the ancestor of the West Saxon
2949,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,house. Yet we have no evidence that the English were regarded as having
2950,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,come from Scandinavia.
2951,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
2952,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,The last problem admits of easy solution. In heathen times the English
2953,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"traced the pedigree of most of their kings to Woden, and stopped there. For"
2954,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"higher than that they could not go. But a Christian poet or genealogist,"
2955,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"who had no belief in Woden as a god, would regard the All Father as a"
2956,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"man--a mere man who, by magic powers, had made the heathen believe he was a"
2957,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,god. To such a Christian pedigree-maker Woden would convey no idea of
2958,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,finality; he would feel no difficulty in giving this human Woden any number
2959,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"of ancestors. Wishing to glorify the pedigree of his king, he would add any"
2960,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"other distinguished and authentic genealogies, and the obvious place for"
2961,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"these would be at the end of the line, i.e., above Woden. Hence we have in"
2962,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"some quite early (not West Saxon) pedigrees, five names given as ancestors"
2963,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"of Woden. These five names end in Geat or Geata, who was apparently"
2964,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"regarded as a god, and was possibly Woden under another name[150]. Somewhat"
2965,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"later, in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, under {73} the year 855, we have a"
2966,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,long version of the West Saxon pedigree with yet nine further names above
2967,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Geat, ending in Sceaf. Sceaf is described as a son of Noah, and so the"
2968,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"pedigree is carried back to Adam, 25 generations in all beyond Woden[151]."
2969,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"But it is rash to assume with Müllenhoff that, because Sceaf comes at the"
2970,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"head[152] of this English pedigree, Sceaf was therefore essentially an"
2971,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,English hero. _All_ these later stages above Woden look like the ornate
2972,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"additions of a later compiler. Some of the figures, Finn, Sceldwa, Heremod,"
2973,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Sceaf himself, we have reason to identify with the primitive heroes of"
2974,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,other nations.
2975,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
2976,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"The genealogist who finally made Sceaf into a son born to Noah in the ark,"
2977,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,and then carried the pedigree nine stages further back through Noah to
2978,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Adam, merely made the last of a series of accretions. It does not follow"
2979,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"that, because he made them ancestors of the English king, this compiler"
2980,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"regarded Noah, Enoch and Adam as Englishmen. Neither need he have so"
2981,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,regarded Sceaf or Scyld[153] or Beaw. In fact--and this has constantly been
2982,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"overlooked--the authority for Sceaf, Scyld and Beaw as Anglo-Saxon heroes"
2983,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,is but little stronger than the authority for Noah and Adam in that
2984,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,capacity. No manuscript exists which stops at Scyld or Sceaf. There is no
2985,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"version which goes beyond Geat except that which goes up to Adam. Scyld,"
2986,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Beaw, Sceaf, Noah and Adam as heroes of English mythology are all alike"
2987,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,doubtful.
2988,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
2989,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"We must be careful, however, to define what we mean when we regard these"
2990,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,stages of the pedigree as doubtful. They are doubtful in so far as they are
2991,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"represented as standing above Woden in the Anglo-Saxon pedigree, because it"
2992,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"is incredible that, in primitive and heathen times, Woden was credited with"
2993,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,a dozen or more forefathers. The _position_ of these names in the pedigree
2994,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,is therefore doubtful. But it is only their connection with the West Saxon
2995,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"house that is unauthentic. It does not follow that the names are, _per se_,"
2996,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"unauthentic. On the contrary, it is because the genealogist had such"
2997,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,implicit belief in the authenticity of the generations {74} from Noah to
2998,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Adam that he could not rest satisfied with his West Saxon pedigree till he
2999,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"had incorporated these names. They are not West Saxon, but they are part of"
3000,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,a tradition much more ancient than any pedigree of the West Saxon kings.
3001,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,And the argument which applies to the layer of Hebrew names between Noah
3002,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,and Adam applies equally to the layer of Germanic names between Woden and
3003,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Sceaf. From whatever branch of the Germanic race the genealogist may have
3004,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"taken them, the fact that he placed them where he did in the pedigree is a"
3005,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,proof of his veneration for them. But we must not without evidence claim
3006,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,them as West Saxon or Anglo-Saxon: we must not be surprised if evidence
3007,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"points to some of them being connected with other nations--as Heremod, for"
3008,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"example, with the Danes[154]."
3009,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3010,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3011,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3012,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,More difficult are the other problems. William of Malmesbury tells the
3013,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"story of Sceaf, with the attributes of a culture-hero: _Beowulf_, four"
3014,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"centuries earlier, tells it of Scyld, a warrior hero: Ethelwerd tells it of"
3015,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Sceaf, but gives him the warrior attributes of Scyld[155] instead of the"
3016,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,sheaf of corn.
3017,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3018,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,The earlier scholars mostly agreed[156] in regarding Malmesbury's
3019,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,attribution of the story to Sceaf as the original and correct version of
3020,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"the story, in spite of its late date. As a representative of these early"
3021,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,scholars we may take Müllenhoff[157]. Müllenhoff's love of mythological
3022,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"interpretation found ample scope in the story of the child with the sheaf,"
3023,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"which he, with considerable reason, regarded as a ""culture-myth."""
3024,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Müllenhoff believed the carrying over of the attributes of a god to a line
3025,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,of his supposed descendants to be a common feature of myth--the descendants
3026,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"representing the god under another name. In accordance with this view,"
3027,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Scyld could be explained as an ""hypostasis"" of his father or forefather"
3028,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Sceaf, as a figure further explaining him and representing him, so that in"
3029,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"the end the tale of the boat arrival came to be told, in _Beowulf_, of"
3030,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Scyld instead of Sceaf.
3031,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3032,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,{75}
3033,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3034,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Recent years have seen a revolt against most of Müllenhoff's theories. The
3035,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,view that the story originally belonged to Sceaf has come to be regarded
3036,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"with a certain amount of impatience as ""out of date."" Even so fine a"
3037,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,scholar as Dr Lawrence has expressed this impatience:
3038,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3039,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"""That the graceful story of the boy sailing in an open boat to the land"
3040,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,of his future people was told originally of Sceaf ... needs no detailed
3041,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,refutation at the present day.
3042,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3043,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"""The attachment of the motive to Sceaf must be, as an examination of"
3044,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"the sources shows, a later development[158]."""
3045,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3046,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Accordingly the view of recent scholars has been this: That the story
3047,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"belongs essentially to Scyld. That, as the hero of the boat story is"
3048,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"obviously of unknown parentage, we must interpret _Scefing_ not as ""son of"
3049,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Sceaf"" but as ""with the sheaf"" (in itself a quite possible explanation)."
3050,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,That this stage of the story is preserved in _Beowulf_. That subsequently
3051,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"_Scyld Scefing_, standing at the head of the pedigree, came to be"
3052,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"misunderstood as ""Scyld, son of Sceaf"". That consequently the story, which"
3053,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"must be told of the earlier ancestor, was thus transferred from Scyld to"
3054,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,his supposed father Sceaf--the version which is found in Ethelwerd and
3055,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,William of Malmesbury.
3056,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3057,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"One apparent advantage of this theory is that the oldest version, that of"
3058,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"_Beowulf_, is accepted as the correct and original one, and the much later"
3059,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,versions of the historians Ethelwerd and William of Malmesbury are regarded
3060,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,as subsequent corruptions. This on the surface seems eminently reasonable.
3061,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,But let us look closer. _Scyld Scefing_ in _Beowulf_ is to be interpreted
3062,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"""Scyld with the Sheaf."" But _Beowulf_ nowhere mentions the sheaf as part of"
3063,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Scyld's equipment. On the contrary, we gather that the hero is connected"
3064,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,rather with prowess in war. It is the same in Ethelwerd. It is not till
3065,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,William of Malmesbury that the sheaf comes into the story. So that the
3066,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"interpretation of _Scefing_ as ""with the sheaf"" assumes the accuracy of"
3067,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,William of Malmesbury's story even in a point where it receives no support
3068,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,from the _Beowulf_ version. In other words this theory does the very thing
3069,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,to avoid doing which it was called into being[159].
3070,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3071,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,{76}
3072,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3073,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Besides this, there are two fundamental objections to the theory that Sceaf"
3074,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"is a late creation, a figure formed from the misunderstanding of the"
3075,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,epithet _Scefing_ applied to _Scyld_. One portion of the poem of _Widsith_
3076,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"consists of a catalogue of ancient kings, and among these occurs _Sceafa_,"
3077,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"ruling the Langobards. Now portions of _Widsith_ are very ancient, and this"
3078,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,catalogue in which Sceafa occurs is almost certainly appreciably older than
3079,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,_Beowulf_ itself.
3080,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3081,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Secondly, the story of the wonderful foundling who comes over the sea from"
3082,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"the unknown and founds a royal line, must _ex hypothesi_ be told of the"
3083,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"first in the line, and we have seen that it is Sceaf, not Scyld, who comes"
3084,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,at the head of the Teutonic names in the genealogy in the _Anglo-Saxon
3085,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Chronicle_.
3086,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3087,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Now we can date this genealogy fairly exactly. It occurs under the year
3088,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"855, and seems to have been drawn up at the court of King Æthelwulf. In any"
3089,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,case it cannot be later than the latter part of Alfred's reign. This takes
3090,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,us back to a period when the old English epic was still widely popular. A
3091,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,genealogist at Alfred's court must have known much about Old English story.
3092,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3093,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,These facts are simply not consistent with the belief that Sceaf is a late
3094,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"creation, a figure formed from a misunderstanding of the epithet _Scefing_,"
3095,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,applied to Scyld[160].
3096,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3097,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,{77}
3098,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3099,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,To arrive at any definite conclusion is difficult. But the following may be
3100,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,hazarded.
3101,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3102,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,It may be taken as proved that the Scyld or Sceldwa of the genealogists is
3103,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,identical with the Scyld Scefing of _Beowulf_. For Sceldwa according to the
3104,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"genealogy is also ultimately a _Sceafing_, and is the father of Beow; Scyld"
3105,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,is _Scefing_ and is father of Beowulf[161].
3106,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3107,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,It is equally clear that the Scyld Scefing of _Beowulf_ is identical with
3108,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,the Skjold of the Danish genealogists and historians. For Scyld and Skjold
3109,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,are both represented as the founder and head of the Danish royal house of
3110,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Scyldingas or Skjoldungar, and as reigning in the same district. Here,"
3111,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"however, the resemblance ceases. _Beowulf_ tells us of Scyld's marvellous"
3112,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,coming and departure. The only Danish authority who tells us much of Skjold
3113,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"is Saxo Grammaticus, who records how as a boy Skjold wrestled successfully"
3114,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"with a bear and overcame champions, and how later he annulled unrighteous"
3115,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"laws, and distinguished himself by generosity to his court. But the Danish"
3116,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"and English accounts have nothing specifically in common, though the type"
3117,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,they portray is the same--that of a king from his youth beloved by his
3118,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"retainers and feared by neighbouring peoples, whom he subdues and makes"
3119,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,tributary. It looks rather as if the oldest traditions had had little to
3120,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,say about this hero beyond the typical things which might be said of any
3121,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,great king; so that Danes and English had each supplied the deficiency in
3122,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,their own way.
3123,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3124,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Now this is exactly what we should expect. For Scyld-Skjold is hardly a
3125,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"personality: he is a figure evolved out of the name _Scyldingas_,"
3126,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"_Skjoldungar_, which is an old epic title for the Danes. Of this we may be"
3127,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,fairly certain: the Scyldingas did not get their name because they were
3128,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"really descended from Scyld, but Scyld was created in order to provide an"
3129,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,eponymous father to the Scyldingas[162]. In just the same way {78}
3130,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"tradition also evolved a hero Dan, from whom the Danes were supposed to"
3131,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"have their name. Saxo Grammaticus has combined both pedigrees, making"
3132,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Skjold a descendant of Dan; but usually it was agreed that nothing came
3133,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"before Skjold, that he was the beginning of the Skjoldung line[163]. At"
3134,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"first a mere name, we should expect that he would have no characteristic"
3135,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"save that, like every respectable Germanic king, he took tribute from his"
3136,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,foes and gave it to his friends. He differs therefore from those heroic
3137,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"figures like Hygelac or Guthhere (Gunnar) which, being derived from actual"
3138,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"historic characters, have, from the beginning of their story, certain"
3139,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"definite features attached to them. Scyld is, in the beginning, merely a"
3140,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"name, the ancestor of the Scyldings. Tradition collects round him"
3141,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,gradually.
3142,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3143,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Hence it will be rash to attach much weight to any feature which is found
3144,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,in one account of him only. Anything we are told of Scyld in English
3145,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"sources alone is not to be construed as evidence as to his original story,"
3146,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"but only as to the form that story assumed in England. When, for example,"
3147,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"_Beowulf_ tells us that Scyld is _Scefing_, or that he is father of"
3148,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Beowulf, it will be very rash of us to assume that these relationships"
3149,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"existed in the Danish, but have been forgotten. This is, I think,"
3150,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"universally admitted[164]. Yet the very scholars who emphasize this, have"
3151,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"assumed that the marvellous arrival as a child, in a boat, surrounded by"
3152,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"weapons, is an essential feature of Scyld's story. Yet the evidence for"
3153,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,this is no better and no worse than the evidence for his relationship to
3154,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Sceaf or Beow--it rests solely on the English documents. Accordingly it
3155,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,only shows what was told about Scyld in England.
3156,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3157,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Of course the boat arrival _might_ be an original part of the story of
3158,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"_Scyld-Skjold_, which has been forgotten in his native {79} country, but"
3159,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,remembered in England. But I cannot see that we have any right to assert
3160,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"this, without proof."
3161,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3162,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,What we can assert to have been the original feature of Scyld is this--that
3163,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,he was the eponymous hero king of the Danes. Both _Beowulf_ and the
3164,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Scandinavian authorities agree upon that. The fact that his name (in the
3165,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,form _Sceldwa_) appears in the genealogy of the kings of Wessex is not
3166,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,evidence against a Danish origin. The name appears in close connection with
3167,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"that of Heremod, another Danish king, and is merely evidence of a desire on"
3168,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,the part of the genealogist of the Wessex kings to connect his royal house
3169,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"with the most distinguished family he knew: that of the Scyldingas, about"
3170,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,whom so much is said in the prologue to _Beowulf_.
3171,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3172,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Neither do the instances of place-names in England, such as _Scyldes"
3173,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"treow_, _Scildes well_, prove Scyld to have been an English hero. They"
3174,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,merely prove him to have been a hero who was celebrated in England--which
3175,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,the Prologue to _Beowulf_ alone is sufficient to show to have been the
3176,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,case. For place-names commemorating heroes of alien tribes are common
3177,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,enough[165] on English ground.
3178,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3179,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,So much at least is gained. Whatever Müllenhoff[166] and his followers
3180,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,constructed upon the assumption that Scyld was an essentially Anglo-Saxon
3181,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,hero goes overboard. Scyld is the ancestor king of the Danish house--more
3182,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,than this we can hardly with safety assert.
3183,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3184,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Now let us turn to the figure of Sceaf. This was not necessarily connected
3185,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,with Scyld from the first.
3186,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3187,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,The story of Sceaf first meets us in its completeness in the pages of
3188,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,William of Malmesbury. And William of Malmesbury is a twelfth century
3189,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,authority; by his time the Old English courtly epics had died out--for they
3190,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,could not have long survived the Norman Conquest and the overthrow of Old
3191,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"English court life. But the popular tradition[167] remained, and {80} a"
3192,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"good many of the old stories, banished from the hall, must have lingered on"
3193,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"at the cross-roads--tales of Wade and Weyland, of Offa and Sceaf. For"
3194,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"songs, sung by minstrels at the cross roads, William of Malmesbury is good"
3195,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"evidence, and he owns to having drawn information from similar popular"
3196,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"sources[168]. William's story, then, is evidence that in his own day there"
3197,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,was a tradition of a mythical king Sheaf who came as a child sleeping in a
3198,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"ship with a sheaf of corn at his head How old this tradition may be, we"
3199,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"cannot say. Ethelwerd knew the story, though he has nothing to say of the"
3200,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"sheaf. But we have seen that when we get back to the ninth century, and the"
3201,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"formation of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, at a court where we may be sure"
3202,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"the old English heroic stories were still popular, it is Sceaf and not"
3203,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Sceldwa who is regarded as the beginning of things--the king whose origin
3204,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,is so remote that he is the oldest Germanic ancestor one can get back
3205,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"to[169]: ""he was born in Noah's ark."""
3206,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3207,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Whether or no Noah's ark was chosen as Sceaf's birthplace because legend
3208,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"represented him as coming in a boat over the water, we cannot tell. But the"
3209,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"place he occupies, with only the Biblical names before him, as compared"
3210,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"with Sceldwa the son of Heremod, clearly marks Sceaf rather than Sceldwa as"
3211,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,the hero who comes from the unknown. Turning now to the catalogue of kings
3212,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"in _Widsith_, probably the oldest extant piece of Anglo-Saxon verse, some"
3213,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"generations more ancient than _Beowulf_, we find a King Sceafa, who ruled"
3214,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"over the Langobards. Finally, in _Beowulf_ itself, although the story is"
3215,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"told of Scyld, nevertheless this Scyld is characterized as _Scefing_. If"
3216,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"this means ""with the sheaf,"" then the _Beowulf_-story stands convicted of"
3217,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"imperfection, of needing explanation outside itself from the {81} account"
3218,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"which William of Malmesbury wrote four centuries later. If it means ""son of"
3219,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Sceaf,"" why should a father be given to Scyld, when the story demands that"
3220,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"he should come from the unknown? Was it because, if the boat story was to"
3221,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"be attributed to Scyld, it was felt that this could only be made plausible"
3222,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,by giving him some relation to Sceaf?
3223,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3224,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3225,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3226,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"When we find an ancient king bearing the extraordinary name of ""Sheaf,"" it"
3227,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"is difficult not to connect this with the honour done to the sheaf of corn,"
3228,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,survivals of which have been found in different parts of England. In
3229,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Herrick's time, the sheaves of corn were still kissed as they were carried"
3230,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"home on the Hock-cart, whilst"
3231,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3232,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Some, with great"
3233,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Devotion, stroke the home-borne wheat."
3234,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3235,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Professor Chadwick argues, on the analogy of Prussian and Bulgarian harvest"
3236,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"customs, that the figure of the ""Harvest Queen"" in the English ceremony is"
3237,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"derived from a corn figure made from the last sheaf, and that the sheaf was"
3238,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,once regarded as a religious symbol[170]. But the evidence for this is
3239,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,surely even stronger than would be gathered from Professor Chadwick's very
3240,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,cautious statement. I suppose there is hardly a county in England from Kent
3241,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"to Cornwall and from Kent to Northumberland, where there is not evidence"
3242,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,for honour paid to the last sheaf--an honour which cannot be accounted for
3243,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,as merely expressing the joy of the reapers at having got to the end of
3244,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"their task. In Kent ""a figure composed of some of the best corn"" was made"
3245,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"into a human shape: ""this is afterwards curiously dressed by the women, and"
3246,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"adorned with paper trimmings cut to resemble a cap, ruffles, handkerchief,"
3247,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"etc., of the finest lace. It is brought home with the last load of"
3248,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"corn[171]."" In Northumberland and Durham a sheaf known as the ""Kern baby"""
3249,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"was made into the likeness of a human figure, decked out and brought home"
3250,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,in triumph with dancing and singing[172]. But the most striking form of the
3251,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"sheaf ceremony is found in the honour done to the ""Neck"" in the West of"
3252,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,England.
3253,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3254,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,{82}
3255,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3256,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"... After the wheat is all cut, on most farms in the north of Devon the"
3257,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"harvest people have a custom of ""crying the neck."" I believe that this"
3258,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,practice is seldom omitted on any large farm in that part of the
3259,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"country. It is done in this way. An old man, or someone else well"
3260,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,acquainted with the ceremonies used on the occasion (when the labourers
3261,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"are reaping the last field of wheat), goes round to the shocks and"
3262,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"sheaves, and picks out a little bundle of all the best ears he can"
3263,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"find; this bundle he ties up very neat and trim, and plats and arranges"
3264,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"the straws very tastefully. This is called ""the neck"" of wheat, or"
3265,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"wheaten-ears. After the field is cut out, and the pitcher once more"
3266,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"circulated, the reapers, binders, and the women, stand round in a"
3267,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"circle. The person with ""the neck"" stands in the centre, grasping it"
3268,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"with both his hands. He first stoops and holds it near the ground, and"
3269,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"all the men forming the ring take off their hats, stooping and holding"
3270,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,them with both hands towards the ground. They then all begin at once in
3271,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"a very prolonged and harmonious tone to cry ""the neck!"" at the same"
3272,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"time slowly raising themselves upright, and elevating their arms and"
3273,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"hats above their heads; the person with ""the neck"" also raising it on"
3274,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"high. This is done three times. They then change their cry to ""wee"
3275,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"yen!""--""way yen!""--which they sound in the same prolonged and slow"
3276,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"manner as before, with singular harmony and effect, three times. This"
3277,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,last cry is accompanied by the same movements of the body and arms as
3278,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"in crying ""the neck."" ..."
3279,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3280,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"... After having thus repeated ""the neck"" three times, and ""wee yen"" or"
3281,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"""way yen"" as often, they all burst out into a kind of loud and joyous"
3282,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"laugh, flinging up their hats and caps into the air, capering about and"
3283,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"perhaps kissing the girls. One of them then gets ""the neck,"" and runs"
3284,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"as hard as he can down to the farm-house, where the dairy-maid, or one"
3285,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"of the young female domestics, stands at the door prepared with a pail"
3286,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"of water. If he who holds ""the neck"" can manage to get into the house,"
3287,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"in any way, unseen or openly, by any other way than the door at which"
3288,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"the girl stands with the pail of water, then he may lawfully kiss her;"
3289,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"but, if otherwise, he is regularly soused with the contents of the"
3290,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"bucket. On a fine still autumn evening, the ""crying of the neck"" has a"
3291,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"wonderful effect at a distance, far finer than that of the Turkish"
3292,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"muezzin, which Lord Byron eulogizes so much, and which he says is"
3293,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,preferable to all the bells in Christendom. I have once or twice heard
3294,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"upwards of twenty men cry it, and sometimes joined by an equal number"
3295,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"of female voices. About three years back, on some high grounds, where"
3296,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"our people were harvesting, I heard six or seven ""necks"" cried in one"

3332,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,portion of land adjoining the river. The monks appealed to a judgment of
3333,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"God to vindicate their claim, and this took the shape of {84} placing a"

3340,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Professor Chadwick, who first emphasized the importance of this strange"

3390,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,To sum up:
3391,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3392,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Sceafa, when the Catalogue of Kings in _Widsith_ was drawn up--before"
3393,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"_Beowulf_ was composed, at any rate in its present form--was regarded as an"
3394,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"ancient king. When the West Saxon pedigree was drawn up, certainly not much"
3395,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"more than a century and a half after the composition of _Beowulf_, and"
3396,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"perhaps much less, Sceaf was regarded as the primitive figure in the"
3397,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"pedigree, before whom no one lived save the Hebrew patriarchs. That he was"
3398,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"originally thought of as a child, {86} coming across the water, with the"
3399,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"sheaf of corn, is, in view of the Finnish parallel, exceedingly probable,"
3400,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,and acquires some confirmation from the Chronicler's placing him in Noah's
3401,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,ark. But the definite evidence for this is late.
3402,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3403,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"Scyld, on the other hand, is in the first place probably a mere eponym of"

3407,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"in one case it is expressly said to be ""according to the custom of his"
3408,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"ancestors."" But it seems exceedingly improbable that his original story"
3409,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"represented him as coming over the sea in a boat. For, if so, it remains to"
3410,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,be explained why this motive has entirely disappeared among his own people
3411,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"in Scandinavia, and has been preserved only in England. Would the Danes"
3412,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"have been likely to forget utterly so striking a story, concerning the king"
3413,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"from whom their line derived its name? Further, in England, _Beowulf_ alone"
3414,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"attributes this story to Scyld, whilst later historians attribute it to"
3415,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,Sceaf. In view of the way in which the story of William of Malmesbury is
3416,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"supported by folklore, to regard that story as merely the result of error"
3417,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,or invention seems perilous indeed.
3418,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,
3419,SECTION V. SCEF AND SCYLD.,"On the other hand, all becomes straightforward if we allow that Scyld and"

3438,SECTION VI. BEOW.,Many etymologies have been suggested for _B[=e]ow_. But considering that

3448,SECTION VI. BEOW.,"Norse mythology, together with Magnus Olsen's linguistic"
3449,SECTION VI. BEOW.,"interpretation. The Finnish has a deity Pekko, concerning whom it is"
3450,SECTION VI. BEOW.,"said that he promoted the growth of barley: the Esths, closely akin to"
3451,SECTION VI. BEOW.,"the Finns, have a corresponding Peko, whose image--the size of a"

3453,SECTION VI. BEOW.,"the time of sowing, or else was kept in the corn-bin by a custodian"
3454,SECTION VI. BEOW.,chosen for a year. This Pekko is plainly a personification of the
3455,SECTION VI. BEOW.,barley; the form corresponding phonetically in Runic Norse would be
3456,SECTION VI. BEOW.,*_beggw-_ (from which comes Old Norse _bygg_).
3457,SECTION VI. BEOW.,
3458,SECTION VI. BEOW.,"""So in Norse there was a grain *_beggw-_ (becoming _bygg_) and a"

3462,SECTION VI. BEOW.,"which it is difficult to avoid is, that the corn-spirit 'Barley' and"

3525,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"grew up to rule had long endured cruel need, ""being without a prince[196]."""
3526,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,We hear in _Beowulf_ of one Danish king only whom we can place
3527,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,chronologically before Scyld--viz. Heremod[197]. The way in which Heremod
3528,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,is referred to would fit in very well with the supposition[198] that he was
3529,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,the last of a dynasty; the immediate predecessor of Scyld; and that it was
3530,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,the death or exile of Heremod which ushered in the time when the Danes were
3531,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,without a prince.
3532,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3533,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Now there is a natural tendency in genealogies for each king to be
3534,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"represented as the descendant of his predecessor, whether he really was so"
3535,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"or no; so that in the course of time, and sometimes of a very short time,"
3536,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,the first king of a new dynasty may come to be reckoned as son of a king of
3537,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"the preceding line[199]. Consequently, there would be nothing surprising"
3538,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"if, in another account, we find Scyld represented as a son of Heremod. And"
3539,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"we _do_ find the matter represented thus in the West Saxon genealogy, where"
3540,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Sceldwa or Scyld is son of Heremod. Turning to the Danish accounts,"
3541,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"however, we do not find any _Hermóðr_ (which is the form we should expect"

3543,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"father of Skjold is known, or else (in Saxo Grammaticus) he has a father"
3544,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Lotherus. But, although the names are different, there is some"
3545,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,correspondence between what we are told of Lother and what we are told of
3546,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Heremod. A close parallel has indeed been drawn by Sievers between the
3547,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"whole dynasty: on the one hand Lotherus, his son Skioldus, and his"
3548,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"descendant Frotho, {90} as given in Saxo: and on the other hand the"

3551,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3552,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"The fixed and certain point here is the identity of the central figure,"
3553,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Skioldus-Scyld. All the rest is very doubtful; not that there are not many
3554,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"parallel features, but because the parallels are of a commonplace type"
3555,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,which might so easily recur accidentally.
3556,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3557,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"The story of Lother, as given by Saxo, will be found below: the story of"

3583,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"one and the same, because both heroes are linked in some way or other with"
3584,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Sigemund. How these two kings, Heremod and Sigemund, came to be connected,"
3585,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"we do not know, but we find this connection recurring again and again[201]."
3586,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,This _may_ be {91} mere coincidence: but I doubt if we are justified in
3587,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,assuming it to be so[202].
3588,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3589,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,It has been suggested[203] that both Heremod and Sigemund were originally
3590,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"heroes specially connected with the worship of Odin, and hence grouped"
3591,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,together. The history of the Scandinavian Sigmund is bound up with that of
3592,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"the magic sword which Odin gave him, and with which he was always"
3593,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,victorious till the last fight when Odin himself shattered it.
3594,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3595,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"And we are told in the Icelandic that Odin, whilst he gave a sword to"
3596,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Sigmund, gave a helm and byrnie to Hermoth."
3597,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3598,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Again, whilst in one Scandinavian poem Sigmund is represented as welcoming"
3599,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"the newcomer at the gates of Valhalla, in another the same duty is"
3600,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,entrusted to Hermoth.
3601,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3602,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,It is clear also that the _Beowulf_-poet had in mind some kind of
3603,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"connection, though we cannot tell what, between Sigemund and Heremod."
3604,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3605,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"We may take it, then, that the Heremod who is linked with Sigemund in"
3606,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,_Beowulf_ was also known in Scandinavian literature as a hero in some way
3607,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,connected with Sigmund: whether or no the adventures which Saxo records of
3608,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Lotherus were really told in Scandinavian lands in connection with Hermoth,"
3609,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,we cannot say. The wicked king whose subjects rebel against him is too
3610,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"common a feature of Germanic story for us to feel sure, without a good deal"
3611,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"of corroborative evidence, that the figures of Lotherus and Heremod are"
3612,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,identical.
3613,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3614,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"The next king in the line, Skioldus in Saxo, is, as we have seen, clearly"
3615,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"identical with Scyld in _Beowulf_. But beyond the name, the two traditions"
3616,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"have, as we have also seen, but little in common. Both are youthful"
3617,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"heroes[204], both force neighbouring kings to pay tribute[205]; but such"
3618,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,things are commonplaces[206].
3619,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3620,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,We must therefore turn to the next figure in the pedigree: the son of
3621,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Skjold in Scandinavian tradition is Frothi (Frotho {92} in Saxo)[207], the"
3622,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,son of Scyld in _Beowulf_ is Beowulf the Dane. And Frothi is the father of
3623,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Halfdan (Haldanus in Saxo) as Beowulf the Dane is of Healfdene. The Frothi
3624,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,of Scandinavian tradition corresponds then in position to Beowulf the Dane
3625,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,in Old English story[208].
3626,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3627,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Now of Beowulf the Dane we are told so little that we have really no means
3628,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,of drawing a comparison between him and Frothi. But a _theory_ that has
3629,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,found wide acceptance among scholars assumes that the dragon fight of
3630,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Beowulf the Geat was originally narrated of Beowulf the Dane, and only"
3631,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"subsequently transferred to the Geatic hero. Theoretically, then, Beowulf"
3632,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,the Dane kills a dragon. Now certainly Frotho kills a dragon: and it has
3633,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,been generally accepted[209] that the parallels between the dragon slain by
3634,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Frotho and that slain by Beowulf the Geat are so remarkable as to exclude
3635,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"the possibility of mere accidental coincidence, and to lead us to conclude"
3636,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,that the dragon story was originally told of that Beowulf who corresponds
3637,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"to Frothi, i.e. Beowulf the Dane, son of Scyld and father of Healfdene; not"
3638,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, the Geat."
3639,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3640,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,But are the parallels really so close? We must not forget that here we are
3641,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,building theory upon theory. That the Frotho of Saxo is the same figure as
3642,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Beowulf the Dane in Old English, is a theory, based upon his common"
3643,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,relationship to Skiold-Scyld before him and to Haldanus-Healfdene coming
3644,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"after him: that Beowulf the Dane was the original hero of the dragon fight,"
3645,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,and that that dragon fight was only subsequently transferred to the credit
3646,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"of Beowulf the Geat, is again a theory. Only if we can find real parallels"
3647,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,between the dragon-slaying of Frotho and the dragon-slaying of Beowulf will
3648,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,these theories have confirmation.
3649,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3650,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,{93}
3651,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3652,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Parallels have been pointed out by Sievers which he regards as so close as
3653,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"to justify a belief that both are derived ultimately from an old lay, with"
3654,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,so much closeness that verbal resemblances can still be traced.
3655,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3656,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Unfortunately the parallels are all commonplaces. That Sievers and others
3657,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,have been satisfied with them was perhaps due to the fact that they started
3658,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,by assuming as proved that the dragon fight of Beowulf the Geat belonged
3659,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"originally to Beowulf the Dane[210], and argued that since Frotho in Saxo"
3660,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,occupies a place corresponding exactly to that of Beowulf the Dane in
3661,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"_Beowulf_, a comparatively limited resemblance between two dragons coming,"
3662,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"as it were, at the same point in the pedigree, might be held sufficient to"
3663,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,identify them.
3664,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3665,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"But, as we have seen, the assumption that the dragon fight of Beowulf the"
3666,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Geat belonged originally to Beowulf the Dane is only a theory that will
3667,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,have to stand or fall as we can prove that the dragon fight of Frotho is
3668,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"really parallel to that of Beowulf the Geat, and therefore must have"
3669,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,belonged to the connecting link supplied by the Scylding prince Beowulf the
3670,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Dane. In other words, the theory that the dragon in _Beowulf_ is to be"
3671,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,identified with the dragon which in Saxo is slain by Frotho the Danish
3672,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"prince, father of Haldanus-Healfdene, is one of the main arguments upon"
3673,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,which we must base the theory that the dragon in _Beowulf_ was originally
3674,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"slain by the Danish Beowulf, father of Healfdene, not by Beowulf the Geat."
3675,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"We cannot then turn round, and assert that the fact that they were both"
3676,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"slain by a Danish prince, the father of Healfdene, is an argument for"
3677,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,identifying the dragons.
3678,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3679,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Turning to the dragon fight itself, the following parallels have been noted"
3680,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,by Sievers:
3681,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3682,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"(1) A native (_indigena_) comes to Frotho, and tells him of the"
3683,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,treasure-guarding dragon. An informer (_melda_) plays the same part in
3684,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,_Beowulf_[211].
3685,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3686,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,But a dragon is not game which can be met with every day. He is a shy
3687,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"beast, lurking in desert places. Some informant has very frequently to"
3688,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,guide the hero to his {94} foe[212]. And the situation is widely different.
3689,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Frotho knows nothing of the dragon till directed to the spot: Beowulf's
3690,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"land has been assailed, he knows of the dragon, though he needs to be"
3691,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,guided to its _exact_ lair.
3692,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3693,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"(2) Frotho's dragon lives on an island. Beowulf's lives near the sea, and"
3694,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"there is an island (_[=e]alond_, 2334) in the neighbourhood."
3695,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3696,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"But _[=e]alond_ in _Beowulf_ probably does not mean ""island"" at all: and in"
3697,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,any case the dragon did not live upon the _[=e]alond_. Many dragons have
3698,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,lived near the sea. Sigemund's dragon did so[213].
3699,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3700,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,(3) The hero in each case attacks the dragon single-handed.
3701,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3702,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"But what hero ever did otherwise? On the contrary, Beowulf's exploit"
3703,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,differs from that of Frotho and of most other dragon slayers in that he is
3704,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"unable to _overcome_ his foe single-handed, and needs the support of"
3705,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Wiglaf.
3706,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3707,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,(4) Special armour is carried by the dragon slayer in each case.
3708,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3709,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,But this again is no uncommon feature. The Red Cross Knight also needs
3710,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,special armour. Dragon slayers constantly invent some ingenious or even
3711,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,unique method. And again the parallel is far from close. Frotho is advised
3712,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,to cover his shield and his limbs with the hides of bulls and kine: a
3713,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,sensible precaution against fiery venom. Beowulf constructs a shield of
3714,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,iron[214]: which naturally gives very inferior protection[215].
3715,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3716,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,(5) Frotho's informant tells him that he must be of good courage[216].
3717,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Wiglaf encourages Beowulf[217].
3718,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3719,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,But the circumstances under which the words are uttered are entirely
3720,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"different, nor have the words more than a general resemblance. That a man"
3721,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"needs courage, if he is going to tackle a dragon, is surely a conclusion at"
3722,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,which two minds could have arrived independently.
3723,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3724,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,(6) Both heroes waste their blows at first on the scaly back of the dragon.
3725,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3726,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,{95}
3727,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3728,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"But if the hero went at once for the soft parts, there would be no fight at"
3729,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"all, and all the fun would be lost. Sigurd's dragon-fight is, for this"
3730,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"reason, a one-sided business from the first. To avoid this, Frotho is"
3731,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,depicted as beginning by an attack on the dragon's rough hide (although he
3732,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,has been specially warned by the _indigena_ not to do so):
3733,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3734,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,ventre sub imo
3735,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"esse locum scito quo ferrum mergere fas est,"
3736,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,hunc mucrone petens medium rimaberis anguem[218].
3737,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3738,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,(7) The hoard is plundered by both heroes.
3739,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3740,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"But it is the nature of a dragon to guard a hoard[219]. And, having slain"
3741,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"the dragon, what hero would neglect the gold?"
3742,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3743,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"(8) There are many verbal resemblances: the dragon spits venom[220], and"
3744,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,twists himself into coils[221].
3745,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3746,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Some of these verbal resemblances may be granted as proved: but they surely
3747,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,do not prove the common origin of the two dragon fights. They only tend to
3748,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,prove the common origin of the school of poetry in which these two dragon
3749,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,fights were told. That dragons dwelt in mounds was a common Germanic
3750,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"belief, to which the Cottonian Gnomic verses testify. Naturally, therefore,"
3751,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Frotho's dragon is _montis possessor_: Beowulf's is _beorges hyrde_. The
3752,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"two phrases undoubtedly point back to a similar gradus, to a similar"
3753,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"traditional stock phraseology, and to similar beliefs: that is all. As well"
3754,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"argue that two kings must be identical, because each is called _folces"
3755,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,hyrde_.
3756,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3757,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,These commonplace phrases and commonplace features are surely quite
3758,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,insufficient to prove that the stories are identical--at most they only
3759,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,prove that they bear the impress of one and the same poetical school. If a
3760,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"parallel is to carry weight there must be something individual about it, as"
3761,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"there is, for example, about the arguments by which the identity of Beowulf"
3762,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,and Bjarki have been supported. That a hero comes from {96} Geatland
3763,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,(Gautland) to the court where Hrothulf (Rolf) is abiding; that the same
3764,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,hero subsequently is instrumental in helping Eadgils (Athils) against Onela
3765,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"(Ali)--here we have something tangible. But when two heroes, engaged upon"
3766,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"slaying a dragon, are each told to be brave, the parallel is too general to"
3767,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"be a parallel at all. ""There is a river in Macedon: and there is also"
3768,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"moreover a river at Monmouth, and there is salmons in both."""
3769,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3770,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"And there is a fundamental difference, which would serve to neutralize the"
3771,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"parallels, even did they appear much less accidental than they do."
3772,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3773,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Dragon fights may be classified into several types: two stand out
3774,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,prominently. There is the story in which the young hero begins his career
3775,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"by slaying a dragon or monster and winning, it may be a hoard of gold, it"
3776,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"may be a bride. This is the type of story found, for instance, in the tales"
3777,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"of Sigurd, or Perseus, or St George. On the other hand there is the hero"
3778,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"who, at the end of his career, seeks to ward off evil from himself and his"
3779,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"people. He slays the monster, but is himself slain by it. The great example"
3780,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"of this type is the god Thor, who in the last fight of the gods slays the"
3781,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Dragon, but dies when he has reeled back nine paces from the ""baleful"
3782,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"serpent[222]."""
3783,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3784,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,Now the story of the victorious young Frotho is of the one type: that of
3785,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"the aged Beowulf is of the other. And this difference is essential,"
3786,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"fundamental, dominating the whole situation in each case: giving its"
3787,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"cheerful and aggressive tone to the story of Frotho, giving the elegiac and"
3788,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,pathetic note which runs through the whole of the last portion of
3789,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,_Beowulf_[223]. It is no mere detail which could be added or subtracted by
3790,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,a narrator without altering the essence of the story.
3791,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3792,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,In face of this we must pronounce the two stories essentially and
3793,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"originally distinct. If, nevertheless, there were a large number of"
3794,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"striking and specific similarities, we should have to allow that, though"
3795,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"originally distinct, the one dragon story had influenced the other in"
3796,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"detail. For, whilst each poet who retold the tale would make alterations in"
3797,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"detail, and might {97} import such detail from one dragon story into"
3798,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"another, what we know of the method of the ancient story tellers does not"
3799,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,allow us to assume that a poet would have altered the whole drift of a
3800,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"story, either by changing the last death-struggle of an aged, childless"
3801,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"prince into the victorious feat of a young hero, or by the reverse process."
3802,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3803,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Those, therefore, who hold the parallels quoted above to be convincing, may"
3804,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"believe that one dragon story has influenced another, originally"
3805,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"distinct[224]. To me, it does not appear that even this necessarily follows"
3806,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,from the evidence.
3807,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3808,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,It seems very doubtful whether any of the parallels drawn by Sievers
3809,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"between the stories of Lotherus and Heremod[225], Skioldus and Scyld,"
3810,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Frotho and Beowulf, are more than the resemblances inevitable in poetry"
3811,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"which, like the Old Danish and the Old English, still retains so many"
3812,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,traces of the common Germanic frame in which it was moulded.
3813,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,
3814,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"Indeed, of the innumerable dragon-stories extant, there is probably not one"
3815,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,which we can declare to be really identical with that of Beowulf. There is
3816,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"a Danish tradition which shows many similarities[226], and I have given"
3817,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"this below, in Part II; but rather as an example of a dragon-slaying of the"
3818,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,"_Beowulf_ type, than because I believe in any direct connection between the"
3819,BEOWULF-FROTHO.,two stories.

4059,LITERARY HISTORY.,"monastery, and this fact alone may have often led to confusion in the"
4060,LITERARY HISTORY.,dialectal forms of works transcribed.
4061,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4062,LITERARY HISTORY.,A thorough investigation of the significance of all the abnormal forms in
4063,LITERARY HISTORY.,_Beowulf_ has still to be made. Whether it would repay the labour of the
4064,LITERARY HISTORY.,investigator may well be questioned. In the meantime we may accept the view
4065,LITERARY HISTORY.,that the poem was in all probability originally written in some
4066,LITERARY HISTORY.,"non-West-Saxon dialect, and most probably in an Anglian dialect, since this"
4067,LITERARY HISTORY.,is confirmed by the way in which the Anglian hero Offa is dragged into the
4068,LITERARY HISTORY.,story.
4069,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4070,LITERARY HISTORY.,Ten Brink's attempt to decide the dialect and transmission of _Beowulf_
4071,LITERARY HISTORY.,"will be found in his _Beowulf_, pp. 237-241: he notes the difficulty"
4072,LITERARY HISTORY.,"that the ""Kentish"" forms from which he argues are nearly all such as"
4073,LITERARY HISTORY.,occur also sporadically in West Saxon texts. A classification of the
4074,LITERARY HISTORY.,"forms by P. G. Thomas will be found in the _Modern Language Review_, I,"
4075,LITERARY HISTORY.,202 _etc._ How difficult and uncertain all classification must be has
4076,LITERARY HISTORY.,"been shown by Frederick Tupper (_Pub. Mod. Lang. Assoc. Amer._ XXVI,"

4080,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4081,LITERARY HISTORY.,Somewhat more definite results can be drawn from certain syntactical
4082,LITERARY HISTORY.,"usages. There can be no doubt that as time went on, the use of _se_,"
4083,LITERARY HISTORY.,"_s[=e]o_, _þæt_ became more and more common in O.E. verse. This is largely"
4084,LITERARY HISTORY.,due to the fact that in the older poems the _weak adjective_ + _noun_
4085,LITERARY HISTORY.,appears frequently where we should now use the definite article: _w[=i]sa
4086,LITERARY HISTORY.,"fengel_--""the wise prince""; _se w[=i]sa fengel_ is used where some"
4087,LITERARY HISTORY.,"demonstrative is needed--""that wise prince."" Later, however, _se_,"
4088,LITERARY HISTORY.,"_s[=e]o_, _þæt_ comes to be used in the common and vague sense in which the"
4089,LITERARY HISTORY.,definite article is used in Modern English.
4090,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4091,LITERARY HISTORY.,We consequently get with increasing frequency the use of the _definite
4092,LITERARY HISTORY.,article_ + _weak adjective_ + _noun_: whilst the usage _weak adjective_ +
4093,LITERARY HISTORY.,_noun_ decreases. Some rough criterion of date can thus be obtained by an
4094,LITERARY HISTORY.,examination of a poet's usage in this particular. Of course it would be
4095,LITERARY HISTORY.,absurd--as has been done--to group Old English poems in a strict
4096,LITERARY HISTORY.,chronological order according to the proportion of forms with and without
4097,LITERARY HISTORY.,the article. Individual usage must count for a good deal: {106} also the
4098,LITERARY HISTORY.,scribes in copying and recopying our text must to a considerable extent
4099,LITERARY HISTORY.,have obliterated the earlier practice. Metre and syntax combine to make it
4100,LITERARY HISTORY.,"probable that, in line 9 of our poem, the scribe has inserted the"
4101,LITERARY HISTORY.,unnecessary article _þ[=a]ra_ before _ymbsittendra_: and in the rare cases
4102,LITERARY HISTORY.,"where we have an O.E. poem preserved in two texts, a comparison proves that"
4103,LITERARY HISTORY.,the scribe has occasionally interpolated an article. But this later
4104,LITERARY HISTORY.,tendency to level out the peculiarity only makes it the more remarkable
4105,LITERARY HISTORY.,"that we should find such great differences between O.E. poems, all of them"
4106,LITERARY HISTORY.,extant in copies transcribed about the year 1000.
4107,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4108,LITERARY HISTORY.,How great is the difference between the usage of _Beowulf_ and that of the
4109,LITERARY HISTORY.,great body of Old English poetry will be clear from the following
4110,LITERARY HISTORY.,statistics.
4111,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4112,LITERARY HISTORY.,The proportion of phrases containing the weak adjective + noun with and
4113,LITERARY HISTORY.,without the definite article in the certain works of Cynewulf is as
4114,LITERARY HISTORY.,follows[234]:
4115,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4116,LITERARY HISTORY.,With article  Without article

4130,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4131,LITERARY HISTORY.,The nearest approach to the proportions of _Beowulf_ is in the (certainly

4137,LITERARY HISTORY.,"On the other hand, certain late texts show how fallible this criterion is."
4138,LITERARY HISTORY.,"Anyone dating _Maldon_ solely by ""Lichtenheld's Test"" would assuredly place"
4139,LITERARY HISTORY.,it much earlier than 991.
4140,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4141,LITERARY HISTORY.,{107}
4142,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4143,LITERARY HISTORY.,It is easy to make a false use of grammatical statistics: and this test
4144,LITERARY HISTORY.,should only be applied with the greatest caution. But the difference
4145,LITERARY HISTORY.,between _Beowulf_ and the works of Cynewulf is too striking to be
4146,LITERARY HISTORY.,"overlooked. In _Beowulf_, to every five examples without the article (e.g."
4147,LITERARY HISTORY.,_heaðo-st[=e]apa helm_) we have _one_ with the article (e.g. _se hearda
4148,LITERARY HISTORY.,helm_): in Cynewulf to every five examples without the article we have
4149,LITERARY HISTORY.,_forty_ with it.
4150,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4151,LITERARY HISTORY.,A further test of antiquity is in the use of the weak adjective with the
4152,LITERARY HISTORY.,instrumental--a use which rapidly diminishes.
4153,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4154,LITERARY HISTORY.,There are eighteen such instrumental phrases in _Beowulf_ (3182
4155,LITERARY HISTORY.,lines)[235]. In _Exodus_ (589 lines) there are six
4156,LITERARY HISTORY.,examples[236]--proportionally more than in _Beowulf_. In Cynewulf's
4157,LITERARY HISTORY.,"undoubted works (c. 2478 lines) there is one example only, _beorhtan"
4158,LITERARY HISTORY.,reorde_[237].
4159,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4160,LITERARY HISTORY.,This criterion of the absence of the definite article before the weak
4161,LITERARY HISTORY.,adjective is often referred to as Lichtenheld's Test (see article by
4162,LITERARY HISTORY.,"him in _Z.f.d.A._ XVI, 325 _etc._). It has been applied to the whole"
4163,LITERARY HISTORY.,"body of O.E. poetry by Barnouw (_Textcritische Untersuchungen_, 1902)."
4164,LITERARY HISTORY.,"The data collected by Barnouw are most valuable, but we must be"
4165,LITERARY HISTORY.,"cautious in the conclusions we draw, as is shown by Sarrazin (_Eng."
4166,LITERARY HISTORY.,"Stud._ XXXVIII, 145 _etc._), and Tupper (_Pub. Mod. Lang. Assoc._ XXVI,"
4167,LITERARY HISTORY.,274).
4168,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4169,LITERARY HISTORY.,"Exact enumeration of instances is difficult. For example, Lichtenheld"
4170,LITERARY HISTORY.,gave 22 instances of definite article + weak adjective + noun in
4171,LITERARY HISTORY.,_Beowulf_[238]. But eight of these are not quite certain; _se g[=o]da
4172,LITERARY HISTORY.,"m[=æ]g Hygel[=a]ces_ may be not ""the good kinsman of Hygelac,"" but ""the"
4173,LITERARY HISTORY.,"good one--the kinsman of Hygelac,"" for there is the half line pause"
4174,LITERARY HISTORY.,after _g[=o]da_. These eight examples therefore should be
4175,LITERARY HISTORY.,"deducted[239]. One instance, though practically certain, is the result"
4176,LITERARY HISTORY.,of conjectural emendation[240]. Of the remaining thirteen[241] three
4177,LITERARY HISTORY.,are variations of the same phrase.
4178,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4179,LITERARY HISTORY.,The statistics given above are those of Brandl (_Sitzungsberichte d. k.
4180,LITERARY HISTORY.,"Preuss. Akad. d. Wissenschaften_, 1905, p. 719) which are based upon"
4181,LITERARY HISTORY.,those of Barnouw.
4182,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4183,LITERARY HISTORY.,"""_Morsbach's Test._"""
4184,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4185,LITERARY HISTORY.,Sievers' theories as to O.E. metre have not been accepted by all scholars
4186,LITERARY HISTORY.,in their entirety. But the statistics which he {108} collected enable us to
4187,LITERARY HISTORY.,"say, with absolute certainty, that some given types of verse were not"
4188,LITERARY HISTORY.,acceptable to the ear of an Old English bard.
4189,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4190,LITERARY HISTORY.,"Sceptics may emphasize the fact that Old English texts are uncertain, that"
4191,LITERARY HISTORY.,"nearly all poems are extant in one MS only, that the MS in each case was"
4192,LITERARY HISTORY.,"written down long after the poems were composed, and that precise verbal"
4193,LITERARY HISTORY.,accuracy is therefore not to be expected[242]. All the more remarkable then
4194,LITERARY HISTORY.,"becomes the fact, for it is a fact, that there are certain types of line"
4195,LITERARY HISTORY.,"which never occur in _Beowulf_, and that there are other types which are"
4196,LITERARY HISTORY.,"exceedingly rare. Again, there are certain types of line which _do_ occur"
4197,LITERARY HISTORY.,"in _Beowulf_ as we have it, though they seem contrary to the principles of"
4198,LITERARY HISTORY.,O.E. scansion. When we find that such lines consistently contain some word
4199,LITERARY HISTORY.,which had a different metrical value when our extant MS of _Beowulf_ was
4200,LITERARY HISTORY.,"transcribed, from that which it had at the earlier date when _Beowulf_ was"
4201,LITERARY HISTORY.,"composed, and that the earlier value makes the line metrical, the"
4202,LITERARY HISTORY.,conclusion is obvious. _Beowulf_ must have been composed at a time or in a
4203,LITERARY HISTORY.,dialect when the earlier metrical values held good.
4204,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4205,LITERARY HISTORY.,"But we reach a certain date beyond which, if we put the language back into"
4206,LITERARY HISTORY.,"its older form, it will no longer fit into the metrical structure. For"
4207,LITERARY HISTORY.,"example, words like _fl[=o]d_, _feld_, _eard_ were originally ""u-nouns"":"
4208,LITERARY HISTORY.,"with nom. and acc. sing. _fl[=o]du_, etc. But the half-line _ofer fealone"
4209,LITERARY HISTORY.,fl[=o]d_ (1950) becomes exceedingly difficult if we put it in the form
4210,LITERARY HISTORY.,_ofer fealone fl[=o]du_[243]: the half-line _f[=i]felcynnes eard_ becomes
4211,LITERARY HISTORY.,absolutely impossible in the form _f[=i]felcynnes eardu_[244].
4212,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4213,LITERARY HISTORY.,"It can, consequently, with some certainty be argued that these half-lines"
4214,LITERARY HISTORY.,"were composed after the time when _fl[=o]du_, _eardu_ had become _fl[=o]d_,"
4215,LITERARY HISTORY.,"_eard_. Therefore, it has been further argued, _Beowulf_ was composed after"
4216,LITERARY HISTORY.,that date. But are we justified in this further step--in assuming that
4217,LITERARY HISTORY.,because a certain number of half-lines in _Beowulf_ must have been composed
4218,LITERARY HISTORY.,"after a certain date, therefore _Beowulf_ itself must have been composed"
4219,LITERARY HISTORY.,after that date?
4220,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4221,LITERARY HISTORY.,{109}
4222,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4223,LITERARY HISTORY.,From what we know of the mechanical way in which the Old English _scribe_
4224,LITERARY HISTORY.,"worked, we have no reason to suppose that he would have consistently"
4225,LITERARY HISTORY.,"altered what he found in an older copy, so as to make it metrical according"
4226,LITERARY HISTORY.,to the later speech into which he was transcribing it. But if we go back to
4227,LITERARY HISTORY.,"a time when poems were committed to memory by a _scop_, skilled in the laws"
4228,LITERARY HISTORY.,"of O.E. metre, the matter is very different. A written poem may be copied"
4229,LITERARY HISTORY.,"word for word, even though the spelling is at the same time modernized, but"
4230,LITERARY HISTORY.,it is obvious that a poem preserved orally will be altered slightly from
4231,LITERARY HISTORY.,"time to time, if the language in which it is written is undergoing changes"
4232,LITERARY HISTORY.,which make the poem no longer metrically correct.
4233,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4234,LITERARY HISTORY.,Imagine the state of things at the period when final _u_ was being lost
4235,LITERARY HISTORY.,after a long syllable. This loss of a syllable would make a large number of
4236,LITERARY HISTORY.,the half-lines and formulas in the old poetry unmetrical. Are we to suppose
4237,LITERARY HISTORY.,"that the whole of O.E. poetry was at once scrapped, and entirely new poems"
4238,LITERARY HISTORY.,composed to fit in with the new sound laws? Surely not; old formulas would
4239,LITERARY HISTORY.,"be recast, old lines modified where they needed it, but the old poetry"
4240,LITERARY HISTORY.,"would go on[245], with these minor verbal changes adapting it to the new"
4241,LITERARY HISTORY.,"order of things. We can see this taking place, to a limited extent, in the"
4242,LITERARY HISTORY.,transcripts of Middle English poems. In the transmission of poems by word
4243,LITERARY HISTORY.,of mouth it would surely take place to such an extent as to baffle later
4244,LITERARY HISTORY.,investigation[246].
4245,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4246,LITERARY HISTORY.,Consequently I am inclined to agree that this test is hardly final except
4247,LITERARY HISTORY.,"""on the assumption that the poems were written down from the very"
4248,LITERARY HISTORY.,"beginning[247]."" And we are clearly not justified in making any such"
4249,LITERARY HISTORY.,"assumption. A small number of such lines would accordingly give, not so"
4250,LITERARY HISTORY.,much a means of fixing a period before which _Beowulf_ cannot have been
4251,LITERARY HISTORY.,"composed, as merely {110} one before which _Beowulf_ cannot have been fixed"
4252,LITERARY HISTORY.,by writing in its present form.
4253,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4254,LITERARY HISTORY.,"If, however, more elaborate investigation were to show that the"
4255,LITERARY HISTORY.,_percentage_ of such lines is _just as great_ in _Beowulf_ as it is in
4256,LITERARY HISTORY.,"poems certainly written after the sound changes had taken place, it might"
4257,LITERARY HISTORY.,"be conceded that the test was a valid one, and that it proved _Beowulf_ to"
4258,LITERARY HISTORY.,have been written after these sound changes occurred.
4259,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4260,LITERARY HISTORY.,This would then bring us to our second difficulty. At what date exactly did
4261,LITERARY HISTORY.,these sound changes take place? The chief documents available are the
4262,LITERARY HISTORY.,"proper names in Bede's History, and in certain Latin charters, the glosses,"
4263,LITERARY HISTORY.,"and a few early runic inscriptions. Most important, although very scanty,"
4264,LITERARY HISTORY.,"are the charters, since they bear a date. With these we proceed to"
4265,LITERARY HISTORY.,investigate:
4266,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4267,LITERARY HISTORY.,A. The dropping of the _u_ after a long accented syllable (_fl['=o]du_
4268,LITERARY HISTORY.,"becoming _fl['=o]d_), or semi-accented syllable (_St['=a]nfòrdu_ becoming"
4269,LITERARY HISTORY.,_St['=a]nfòrd_).
4270,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4271,LITERARY HISTORY.,There is evidence from an Essex charter that this was already lost in 692
4272,LITERARY HISTORY.,"or 693 (_uuidmundesfelt_)[248]. From this date on, examples without the _u_"
4273,LITERARY HISTORY.,are forthcoming in increasing number[249]. One certain example only has
4274,LITERARY HISTORY.,been claimed for the preservation of _u_. In the runic inscription on the
4275,LITERARY HISTORY.,"""Franks casket"" _flodu_ is found for _flod_. But the spelling of the Franks"
4276,LITERARY HISTORY.,"casket is erratic: for example _giuþeasu_ is also found for _giuþeas_, ""the"
4277,LITERARY HISTORY.,"Jews."" Now _u_ here is impossible[250], and we must conclude perhaps that"
4278,LITERARY HISTORY.,the inscriber of the runes intended to write _giuþea su[mæ]_[250] or
4279,LITERARY HISTORY.,"_giuþea su[na]_[251], ""some of the Jews,"" ""the sons of the Jews,"" and that"
4280,LITERARY HISTORY.,"having reached the end of his line at _u_, he neglected to complete the"
4281,LITERARY HISTORY.,word: or else perhaps that he wrote _giuþeas_ and having some additional
4282,LITERARY HISTORY.,"space added a _u_ at the end of his line, just for fun. Whichever"
4283,LITERARY HISTORY.,"explanation we {111} adopt, it will apply to _flodu_, which equally comes"
4284,LITERARY HISTORY.,"at the end of a line, and the _u_ of which may equally have been part of"
4285,LITERARY HISTORY.,some following word which was never completed[252].
4286,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4287,LITERARY HISTORY.,Other linguistic data of the Franks casket would lead us to place it
4288,LITERARY HISTORY.,"somewhere in the first half of the eighth century, and we should hardly"
4289,LITERARY HISTORY.,expect to find _u_ preserved as late as this[253]. For we have seen that by
4290,LITERARY HISTORY.,693 the _u_ was already lost after a subordinate accent in the Essex
4291,LITERARY HISTORY.,charter. Yet it is arguable that the _u_ was retained later after a long
4292,LITERARY HISTORY.,accented syllable (_fl[=ó]du_) than after a subordinate accent
4293,LITERARY HISTORY.,"(_uu[=í]dmùndesfèlt_); and, besides, the casket is Northumbrian, and the"
4294,LITERARY HISTORY.,sound changes need not have been simultaneous all over the country.
4295,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4296,LITERARY HISTORY.,We cannot but feel that the evidence is pitifully scanty. All we can say is
4297,LITERARY HISTORY.,that _perhaps_ the _flodu_ of the Franks casket shows that _u_ was still
4298,LITERARY HISTORY.,preserved after a fully accented syllable as late as 700. But the _u_ in
4299,LITERARY HISTORY.,"_flodu_ may be a deliberate archaism on the part of the writer, may be a"
4300,LITERARY HISTORY.,"local dialectal survival, may be a mere miswriting."
4301,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4302,LITERARY HISTORY.,B. The preservation of _h_ between consonant and vowel.
4303,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4304,LITERARY HISTORY.,Here there is one clear example which we can date: the archaic spelling of
4305,LITERARY HISTORY.,the proper name _Welhisc_. _Signum manus uelhisci_ occurs in a Kentish
4306,LITERARY HISTORY.,charter of 679[254]. The same charter shows _h_ already lost between
4307,LITERARY HISTORY.,"vowels: _uuestan ae_ (_ae_ dative of _[=e]a_, ""river,"" cf. Gothic _ahwa_)."
4308,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4309,LITERARY HISTORY.,"Not much can be argued from the proper name _Welhisc_, as to the current"
4310,LITERARY HISTORY.,"pronunciation in Kent in 679, for an old man may well have continued to"
4311,LITERARY HISTORY.,"spell his name as it was spelt when he was a child, even though the current"
4312,LITERARY HISTORY.,pronunciation had changed[255]. But we have further evidence in the
4313,LITERARY HISTORY.,"glosses, which show _h_ sometimes preserved and sometimes not. These"
4314,LITERARY HISTORY.,glosses are mechanical copies of an original which was presumably compiled
4315,LITERARY HISTORY.,between 680 and 720. We are therefore justified in arguing that at that
4316,LITERARY HISTORY.,"date _h_ was still preserved, at any rate occasionally."
4317,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4318,LITERARY HISTORY.,{112}
4319,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4320,LITERARY HISTORY.,"Of ""Morsbach's test"" we can then say that it establishes something of an"
4321,LITERARY HISTORY.,argument that _Beowulf_ was composed after the date when final _u_ after a
4322,LITERARY HISTORY.,"long syllable, or _h_ between consonant and vowel, were lost, and that this"
4323,LITERARY HISTORY.,date was probably within a generation or so of the year 700 A.D. But there
4324,LITERARY HISTORY.,are too many uncertain contingencies involved to make the test at all a
4325,LITERARY HISTORY.,conclusive one.
4326,LITERARY HISTORY.,
4327,LITERARY HISTORY.,Morsbach's _Zur Datierung des Beowulf-epos_ will be found in the
4328,LITERARY HISTORY.,"Göttingen _Nachrichten_, 1906, pp. 252-77. These tests have been worked"
4329,LITERARY HISTORY.,out for the whole body of Old English poetry in the _Chronologische

4632,POEM?,"Later students (like the man in Dante, placed between two equally enticing"
4633,POEM?,dishes) have been unable to decide in favour of either of the rival
4634,POEM?,"theories of Müllenhoff and ten Brink, and consequently the unity of the"
4635,POEM?,"poem, which always had its champions, has of late years come to be"
4636,POEM?,maintained with increasing conviction and certainty.
4637,POEM?,
4638,POEM?,Yet many recent critics have followed Müllenhoff so far at least as to
4639,POEM?,believe that the Christian passages are inconsistent with what they regard
4640,POEM?,"as the ""essentially heathen"" tone of the rest of the poem, and are"
4641,POEM?,therefore the work of an interpolator[279].
4642,POEM?,
4643,POEM?,"Certainly no one can escape a feeling of incongruity, as he passes from"
4644,POEM?,"ideas of which the home lies in the forests of ancient Germany, to others"
4645,POEM?,which come from the Holy Land. But that both sets of ideas could not have
4646,POEM?,"been cherished, in England, about the year 700, by one and the same poet,"
4647,POEM?,is an assumption which calls for examination.
4648,POEM?,
4649,POEM?,"As Christianity swept northward, situations were created which to the"
4650,POEM?,modern student are incongruous. But the Teutonic chief often had a larger
4651,POEM?,"mind than the modern student: he needed to have, if he was to get the best"
4652,POEM?,at the same time both from his wild fighting men and from his Latin clerks.
4653,POEM?,It is this which gives so remarkable a character to the great men of the
4654,POEM?,"early centuries of converted Teutonism: men, like Theodoric the Great or"
4655,POEM?,"Charles the Great, who could perform simultaneously the duties of a"
4656,POEM?,Germanic king and of a Roman Emperor: kings like Alfred the Great or St
4657,POEM?,"Olaf, who combined the character of the tough fighting chieftain with that"
4658,POEM?,of the saintly churchman. I love to think of these incongruities: to
4659,POEM?,"remember that the warrior Alfred, surrounded by _thegn_ and _gesith_,"
4660,POEM?,"listening to the ""Saxon songs"" which he loved, was yet the same Alfred who"
4661,POEM?,painfully translated Gregory's _Pastoral {122} Care_ under the direction of
4662,POEM?,"foreign clerics. It is well to remember that Charles the Great, the"
4663,POEM?,"catholic and the orthodox, collected ancient lays which his successors"
4664,POEM?,"thought too heathen to be tolerated; or that St Olaf (who was so holy that,"
4665,POEM?,"having absent mindedly chipped shavings off a stick on Sunday, he burnt"
4666,POEM?,"them, as penance, on his open hand) nevertheless allowed to be sung before"
4667,POEM?,"him, on the morning of his last fight, one of the most wild and utterly"
4668,POEM?,heathen of all the old songs--the _Bjarkamál_.
4669,POEM?,
4670,POEM?,It has been claimed that the account of the funeral rites of Beowulf is
4671,POEM?,"such as ""no Christian poet could or would have composed[280]."" Lately this"
4672,POEM?,argument has been stated more at length:
4673,POEM?,
4674,POEM?,"""In the long account of Beowulf's obsequies--beginning with the dying"
4675,POEM?,king's injunction to construct for him a lofty barrow on the edge of
4676,POEM?,"the cliff, and ending with the scene of the twelve princes riding round"
4677,POEM?,"the barrow, proclaiming the dead man's exploits--we have the most"
4678,POEM?,detailed description of an early Teutonic funeral which has come down
4679,POEM?,"to us, and one of which the accuracy is confirmed in every point by"
4680,POEM?,archaeological or contemporary literary evidence[281]. Such an account
4681,POEM?,must have been composed within living memory of a time when ceremonies
4682,POEM?,"of this kind were still actually in use[282]."""
4683,POEM?,
4684,POEM?,"Owing to the standing of the scholar who urges it, this argument is coming"
4685,POEM?,"to rank as a dogma[283], and needs therefore rather close examination."
4686,POEM?,
4687,POEM?,Professor Chadwick _may_ be right in urging that the custom of burning the
4688,POEM?,dead had gone out of use in England even before Christianity was
4689,POEM?,"introduced[284]: anyhow it is certain that, wherever it survived, the"
4690,POEM?,"practice was disapproved by ecclesiastics, and was, indeed, formally"
4691,POEM?,censured and suppressed by the church abroad.
4692,POEM?,
4693,POEM?,The church equally censured and endeavoured to suppress the ancient
4694,POEM?,"""heathen lays""; but without equal success. Now, in many of these lays the"
4695,POEM?,"heathen rites of cremation must certainly have been depicted, and, in this"
4696,POEM?,"way, the memory of the old funeral customs must have been kept fresh, long"
4697,POEM?,{123} after the last funeral pyre had died out in England. Of course there
4698,POEM?,"were then, as there have been ever since, puritanical people who objected"
4699,POEM?,that heathen lays and heathen ways were no fit concern for a Christian man.
4700,POEM?,But the protests of such purists are just the strongest evidence that the
4701,POEM?,average Christian did continue to take an interest in these things. We have
4702,POEM?,seen that the very monks of Lindisfarne had to be warned by Alcuin. I
4703,POEM?,"cannot see that there is any such _a priori_ impossibility that a poet,"
4704,POEM?,"though a sincere Christian enough, would have described a funeral in the"
4705,POEM?,"old style, modelling his account upon older lays, or upon tradition derived"
4706,POEM?,from those lays.
4707,POEM?,
4708,POEM?,"The church might disapprove of the practice of cremation, but we have no"
4709,POEM?,reason to suppose that mention of it was tabooed. And many of the old
4710,POEM?,"burial customs seem to have kept their hold, even upon the converted."
4711,POEM?,"Indeed, when the funeral of Attila is instanced as a type of the old"
4712,POEM?,"heathen ceremony, it seems to be forgotten that those Gothic chieftains who"
4713,POEM?,rode their horses round the body of Attila were themselves probably Arian
4714,POEM?,"Christians, and that the historian who has preserved the account was an"
4715,POEM?,orthodox cleric.
4716,POEM?,
4717,POEM?,"Saxo Grammaticus, ecclesiastic as he was, has left us several accounts[285]"
4718,POEM?,"of cremations. He mentions the ""pyre built of ships"" and differs from the"
4719,POEM?,poet of _Beowulf_ chiefly because he allows those frankly heathen
4720,POEM?,references to gods and offerings which the poet of _Beowulf_ excludes. Of
4721,POEM?,"course, Saxo was merely translating. One can quite believe that a Christian"
4722,POEM?,"poet composing an account of a funeral in the old days, would have omitted"
4723,POEM?,"the more frankly heathen features, as indeed the _Beowulf_ poet does. But"
4724,POEM?,"Saxo shows us how far into Christian times the ancient funeral, in all its"
4725,POEM?,"heathendom, was remembered; and how little compunction an ecclesiastic had"
4726,POEM?,in recording it. The assumption that no Christian poet would have composed
4727,POEM?,"the account of Beowulf's funeral or of Scyld's funeral ship, seems then to"
4728,POEM?,be quite unjustified.
4729,POEM?,
4730,POEM?,"The further question remains: Granting that he _would_, could he? Is the"
4731,POEM?,account of Beowulf's funeral so true to old custom that it must have been
4732,POEM?,"composed by an eye-witness of {124} the rite of cremation? Is its ""accuracy"
4733,POEM?,confirmed in every point by archaeological or contemporary literary
4734,POEM?,"evidence""?"
4735,POEM?,
4736,POEM?,"As to the archaeological evidence, the fact seems to be that the account is"
4737,POEM?,archaeologically so inexact that it has given great trouble to one eminent
4738,POEM?,"antiquary, Knut Stjerna. That the pyre should be hung with arms, which are"
4739,POEM?,"_burnt_ with the hero (ll. 3139-40), and that then a second supply of"
4740,POEM?,"unburnt treasures should be _buried_ with the cremated bones (ll. 3163-8),"
4741,POEM?,is regarded by Stjerna as extraordinary[286].
4742,POEM?,
4743,POEM?,"Surely, any such inexactitude is what we should expect in a late poet,"
4744,POEM?,drawing upon tradition. He would know that in heathen times bodies were
4745,POEM?,"burnt, and that weapons were buried; and he might well combine both. It is"
4746,POEM?,"not necessary to suppose, as Stjerna does, that the poet has combined two"
4747,POEM?,"separate accounts of Beowulf's funeral, given in older lays, in one of"
4748,POEM?,"which the hero was burnt, and in the other buried. But the fact that an"
4749,POEM?,archaeological specialist finds the account of Beowulf's funeral so inexact
4750,POEM?,"that he has to assume a confused and composite source, surely disposes of"
4751,POEM?,the argument that it is so exact that it must date back to heathen times.
4752,POEM?,
4753,POEM?,"As to confirmation from literary documents, the only one instanced by"
4754,POEM?,Chadwick is the account of the funeral of Attila. The parallel here is by
4755,POEM?,no means so close as has been asserted. The features of Attila's funeral
4756,POEM?,"are: the lying in state, during which the chosen horsemen of the nation"
4757,POEM?,rode round the body singing the dead king's praises; the funeral feast; and
4758,POEM?,the burial (not burning) of the body. Now the only feature which recurs in
4759,POEM?,_Beowulf_ is the praise of the dead man by the mounted thanes. Even here
4760,POEM?,there is an essential difference. Attila's men rode round the dead body of
4761,POEM?,their lord _before_ his funeral. Beowulf's retainers ride and utter their
4762,POEM?,"lament around (not the body but) the grave mound of their lord, ten days"
4763,POEM?,after the cremation.
4764,POEM?,
4765,POEM?,And this is perhaps no accidental discrepancy: it may well correspond to a
4766,POEM?,real difference in practice between the Gothic custom of the time of the
4767,POEM?,migrations and the Anglo-Saxon {125} practice as it prevailed in Christian
4768,POEM?,"times[287]. For many documents, including the _Dream of the Rood_, tend to"
4769,POEM?,"show that the _sorhl[=e]oð_, the lament of the retainers for their dead"
4770,POEM?,"lord, survived into Christian times, but as a ceremony which was subsequent"
4771,POEM?,"not merely to the funeral, but even to the building of the tomb."
4772,POEM?,
4773,POEM?,"So that, here again, so far from the archaeological accuracy of the account"
4774,POEM?,"of Beowulf's funeral being confirmed by the account of that of Attila, we"
4775,POEM?,"find a discrepancy such as we might expect if a Christian poet, in later"
4776,POEM?,"times, had tried to describe a funeral of the old heathen type."
4777,POEM?,
4778,POEM?,"Of course, the evidence is far too scanty to allow of much positive"
4779,POEM?,"argument. Still, _so far as it goes_, and that is not far, it rather tends"
4780,POEM?,"to show that the account of the funeral customs is not quite accurate,"
4781,POEM?,representing what later Christian times knew by tradition of the rite of
4782,POEM?,"cremation, rather than showing the observation of that rite by an"
4783,POEM?,eye-witness.
4784,POEM?,
4785,POEM?,"We must turn, then, to some other argument, if we wish to prove that the"
4786,POEM?,Christian element is inconsistent with other parts of the poem.
4787,POEM?,
4788,POEM?,"A second argument that _Beowulf_ must belong either to heathen times, or to"
4789,POEM?,"the very earliest Christian period in England, has been found in the"
4790,POEM?,"character of the Christian allusions: they contain no ""reference to Christ,"
4791,POEM?,"to the Cross, to the Virgin or the Saints, to any doctrine of the church in"
4792,POEM?,"regard to the Trinity, the Atonement, _etc._[288]"" ""A pious Jew would have"
4793,POEM?,"no difficulty in assenting to them all[289]."" Hence it has been argued[290]"
4794,POEM?,"that they are the work of an interpolator who, working upon a poem"
4795,POEM?,"""essentially heathen,"" was not able to impose upon it more than this ""vague"
4796,POEM?,"and colourless Christianity."" I cannot see this. If passages had to be"
4797,POEM?,"rewritten at all, it was just as easy to rewrite them in a tone"
4798,POEM?,emphatically Christian as in a tone mildly so. The difficulties which the
4799,POEM?,"interpolator would meet in removing a heathen phrase, and composing a"
4800,POEM?,"Christian half-line in substitution, would be metrical, rather than"
4801,POEM?,"theological. For example, in a second {126} half-line the interpolator"
4802,POEM?,could have written _ond h[=a]lig Crist_ or _ylda nergend_ just as easily as
4803,POEM?,"_ond h[=a]lig god_, or _ylda waldend_: he could have put in an allusion to"
4804,POEM?,the Trinity or to the Cross as easily as to the Lord of Hosts or the King
4805,POEM?,of Glory. It would depend upon the alliteration which was the more
4806,POEM?,"convenient. And surely, if he was a monk deliberately sitting down to turn"
4807,POEM?,"a heathen into a Christian poem, he would, of two alternatives, have"
4808,POEM?,favoured the more dogmatically Christian.
4809,POEM?,
4810,POEM?,The vagueness which is so characteristic of the Christian references in
4811,POEM?,_Beowulf_ can then hardly be due to the poem having originally been a
4812,POEM?,"heathen one, worked over by a Christian."
4813,POEM?,
4814,POEM?,"Others have seen in this vagueness a proof ""that the minstrels who"
4815,POEM?,introduced the Christian element had but a vague knowledge of the new
4816,POEM?,"faith[291]"": or that the poem was the work of ""a man who, without having,"
4817,POEM?,"or wanting to have, much definite instruction, had become Christian because"
4818,POEM?,"the Court had newly become Christian[292]."" But, vague as it is, does the"
4819,POEM?,Christianity of _Beowulf_ justify such a judgment as this? Do not the
4820,POEM?,"characters of Hrothgar or of Beowulf, of Hygd or of Wealhtheow, show a"
4821,POEM?,"Christian influence which, however little dogmatic, is anything but"
4822,POEM?,superficial? This is a matter where individual feeling rather than argument
4823,POEM?,must weigh: but the _Beowulf_ does not seem to me the work of a man whose
4824,POEM?,adherence to Christianity is merely nominal[293].
4825,POEM?,
4826,POEM?,"And, so far as the absence of dogma goes, it seems to have been overlooked"
4827,POEM?,"that the Christian references in the _Battle of Maldon_, written when"
4828,POEM?,"England had been Christian for over three centuries, are precisely of the"
4829,POEM?,same vague character as those in _Beowulf_.
4830,POEM?,
4831,POEM?,"Surely the explanation is that to a devout, but not {127}"
4832,POEM?,"theologically-minded poet, writing battle poetry, references to God as the"
4833,POEM?,Lord of Hosts or the Giver of Victory came naturally--references to the
4834,POEM?,Trinity or the Atonement did not. This seems quite a sufficient
4835,POEM?,explanation; though it may be that in _Beowulf_ the poet has consciously
4836,POEM?,"avoided dogmatic references, because he realized that the characters in his"
4837,POEM?,"story were not Christians[294]. That, at the same time, he allows those"
4838,POEM?,characters with whom he sympathizes to speak in a Christian spirit is only
4839,POEM?,what we should expect. Just so Chaucer allows his pagans--Theseus for
4840,POEM?,"instance--to use Christian expressions about God or the soul, whilst"
4841,POEM?,avoiding anything strikingly doctrinal.
4842,POEM?,
4843,POEM?,"Finally I cannot admit that the Christian passages are ""poetically of no"
4844,POEM?,"value[295]."" The description of Grendel nearing Heorot is good:"
4845,POEM?,
4846,POEM?,Ð[=a] c[=o]m of m[=o]re under mist-hleoþum
4847,POEM?,Grendel gongan--
4848,POEM?,
4849,POEM?,but it is heightened when the poet adds:
4850,POEM?,
4851,POEM?,Godes yrre bær.
4852,POEM?,
4853,POEM?,Yet here again it is impossible to argue: it is a matter of individual
4854,POEM?,feeling.
4855,POEM?,
4856,POEM?,"When, however, we come to the further statement of Dr Bradley, that the"
4857,POEM?,"Christian passages are not only interpolations poetically worthless, but"
4858,POEM?,"""may be of any date down to that of the extant MS"" (i.e. about the year"
4859,POEM?,"1000 A.D.), we have reached ground where argument _is_ possible, and where"
4860,POEM?,"definite results can be attained. For Dr Bradley, at the same time that he"
4861,POEM?,"makes this statement about the character of the Christian passages, also"
4862,POEM?,quotes the archaic syntax of _Beowulf_ as proving an early date[296]. _But
4863,POEM?,this archaic syntax is just as prominent a feature of the Christian

5411,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",Now news came to King Rolf and his men up in the castle that a stately man

5413,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",to kill the man. King Rolf asked whether the retainer who had been killed
5414,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","had given any offence. ""Next to none,"" they said: then all the truth of the"
5415,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",matter came up before King Rolf.
5416,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",
5417,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","King Rolf said that it should be far from them to kill the man: ""You have"

5419,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",is a dishonour to me and a great shame to you to do so. I have spoken about
5420,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","it before, and you have paid no attention. I think that this man whom you"

5423,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",
5424,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",Bothvar went before the king and greeted him courteously. The king asked

5440,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","before. He pulled up three men in one place, and then he and Hott sat down"
5441,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",there higher in the hall than the place which had been given to them. The
5442,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","men thought Bothvar overbearing, and there was the greatest ill will among"

5444,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",
5445,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","And when it drew near to Christmas, men became gloomy. Bothvar asked Hott"

5455,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",

5458,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",with this beast. It must be with the cattle as fate will have it: but I do

5460,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","Bothvar went out in secret that night; he caused Hott to go with him, but"
5461,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","Hott did that only under compulsion, and said that it would be the death of"
5462,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",him. Bothvar said that he hoped that it would be better than that. They
5463,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","went away from the hall, and Bothvar had to carry Hott, so frightened was"
5464,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",he. Now they saw the beast; and thereupon Hott cried out as loud as he
5465,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","could, and said that the beast would swallow him. Bothvar said, ""Be silent,"
5466,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","thou dog,"" and threw him down in the mire. And there he lay in no small"

5468,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",
5469,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","Now Bothvar went against the beast, and it happened that his sword was fast"
5470,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","in his sheath when he wished to draw it. Bothvar now tugged at his sword,"
5471,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","it moved, he wrenched the scabbard so that the sword came out. And at once"
5472,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",he plunged it into the beast's shoulder so mightily that it pierced him to
5473,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","the heart, and the beast fell down dead to the earth. After that Bothvar"
5474,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",went where Hott lay. Bothvar took him up and bore him to where the beast
5475,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","lay dead. Hott was trembling all over. Bothvar said, ""Now must thou drink"
5476,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","the blood of the beast."" For long Hott was unwilling, and yet he did not"
5477,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",dare to do anything else. Bothvar made him drink two great sups; also he
5478,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",made him eat somewhat of the heart of the beast.
5479,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",
5480,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","After that Bothvar turned to Hott, and they fought a long time."

5489,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","After that they went home, and were quiet, and no man knew what they had"
5490,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",achieved.
5491,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",
5492,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","In the morning the king asked what news there was of the beast, and whether"

5494,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","king, that all the cattle were safe and uninjured in their folds. The king"
5495,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23",bade his men examine whether any trace could be seen of the beast having
5496,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","visited them. The watchers did so, and came quickly back to the king with"
5497,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","the news that the beast was making for the castle, and in great fury. The"
5498,"B. HRÓLFS SAGA KRAKA, CAP. 23","king bade his retainers be brave, and each play the man according as he had"

6122,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,The _Grettis saga_ was first printed in the middle of the eighteenth
6123,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"century, in Iceland (Marcússon, _Nockrer Marg-frooder Sogu-þatter_,"
6124,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"1756, pp. 81-163). It was edited by Magnússon and Thordarson,"
6125,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Copenhagen, 1853, with a Danish translation, and again by Boer"
6126,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"(_Altnordische Saga-bibliothek_, Halle, 1900). An edition was also"
6127,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"printed at Reykjavik in 1900, edited by V. Ásmundarson."
6128,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6129,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,There are over forty MSS of the saga: _Cod. Arn. Mag. 551 a_ (quoted in
6130,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,the notes below as A) forms the basis of all three modern editions.
6131,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Boer has investigated the relationship of the MSS (_Die
6132,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"handschriftliche überlieferung der Grettissaga, Z.f.d.Ph._ XXXI,"
6133,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"40-60), and has published, in an appendix to his edition, the readings"
6134,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"of five of the more important, in so far as he considers that they can"
6135,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,be utilized to amend the text supplied by A.
6136,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6137,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,The reader who consults the editions of both Magnússon and Boer will be
6138,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"struck by the differences in the text, although both are following the"
6139,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"same MS. Many of these differences are, of course, due to the fact that"
6140,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"the editors are normalizing the spelling, but on different principles:"
6141,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"many others, however, are due to the extraordinary difficulty of the MS"
6142,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"itself. Mr Sigfús Blöndal, of the Royal Library of Copenhagen, has"
6143,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"examined _Cod. Arn. Mag. 551 a_ for me, and he writes:"
6144,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6145,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"""It is the very worst MS I have ever met with. The writing is"
6146,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"small, almost every word is abbreviated, and, worst of all, the"
6147,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"writing is in many places effaced, partly by smoke (I suppose the"
6148,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,MS needs must have been lying for years in some smoky and damp
6149,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,_baðstofa_) rendering the parchment almost as black as
6150,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"shoe-leather, but still more owing to the use of chemicals, which"
6151,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"modern editors have been obliged to use, to make sure of what there"
6152,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"really was in the text. By the use of much patience and a lens, one"
6153,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"can read it, though, in most places. Unfortunately, this does not"
6154,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"apply to the _Glámur_ episode, a big portion of which belongs to"
6155,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"the very worst part of the MS, and the readings of that portion are"
6156,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"therefore rather uncertain."""
6157,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6158,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,The Icelandic text given above agrees in the main with that in the
6159,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"excellent edition of Boer, to whom, in common with all students of the"
6160,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"{163} _Grettis saga_, I am much indebted: but I have frequently adopted"
6161,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,in preference a spelling or wording nearer to that of Magnússon. In
6162,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,several of these instances (notably the spelling of the verses

6211,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Skapti answered, ""There must be some evil being about, if men are more"
6212,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,unwilling to look after thy sheep than those of other folk. Now because
6213,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"thou hast sought counsel of me, I will find thee a shepherd, who is named"
6214,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Glam, a Swede, from Sylgsdale, who came out to Iceland last summer. He is"
6215,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"great and strong, but not much to everybody's taste."""
6216,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6217,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Thorhall said that he would not mind that, if he guarded the sheep well."
6218,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Skapti said that if Glam had not the strength and courage to do that, there"
6219,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,was no hope of anyone else. Then Thorhall went out; this was when the
6220,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,All-Thing was nearly ending.
6221,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6222,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Thorhall missed two light bay horses, and he went himself to look for"
6223,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,them--so it seems that he was not a great man. He went up under Sledge-hill
6224,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,and south along the mountain called Armannsfell.
6225,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6226,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Then he saw where a man came down from Gothashaw, bearing faggots on a"
6227,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"horse. They soon met, and Thorhall asked him his name, and he said he was"
6228,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"called Glam. Glam [Sidenote: p. 148] was tall and strange in bearing, with"
6229,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"blue[299] and glaring eyes, and wolf-grey hair. Thorhall opened his eyes"
6230,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"when he saw him, but yet he discerned that this was he to whom he had been"
6231,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,sent.
6232,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6233,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"""What work art thou best fitted for?"" said Thorhall."
6234,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6235,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Glam said he was well fitted to watch sheep in the winter.
6236,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6237,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"""Wilt thou watch my sheep?"" said Thorhall. ""Skapti gave thee into my hand."""

6242,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"""That will not matter to me,"" said Thorhall, ""and I wish that thou shouldst"

6251,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"""I am not afraid of such phantoms,"" said Glam, ""and it seems to me all the"

6256,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6257,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"After that they struck their bargain, and Glam was to come at the"
6258,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"winter-nights [14th-16th of October]. Then they parted, and Thorhall found"
6259,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,his horses where he had just been searching. Thorhall rode home and thanked
6260,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Skapti for his good deed.
6261,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6262,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Summer passed, and Thorhall heard nothing of his shepherd, and no one knew"
6263,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,anything of him; but at the time appointed he came to Thorhall's Farm. The
6264,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"yeoman greeted him well, but all the others could not abide him, and"
6265,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Thorhall's wife least of all. Glam undertook the watching of the sheep, and"
6266,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"it gave him little trouble. He had a great deep voice, and the sheep came"
6267,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"together as soon as he called them. There was a church at Thorhall's Farm,"
6268,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"but Glam would not go to it. He would have nothing to do with the service,"
6269,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,and was godless; he was obstinate and surly and abhorred by all.
6270,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6271,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Now time went on till it came to Yule eve. Then Glam rose early and called
6272,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"for meat. The yeoman's wife answered, ""That is not the custom of Christian"
6273,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"men to eat meat today, because tomorrow is the first day of Yule,"" said"
6274,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"she, ""and therefore it is right that we should first fast today."""
6275,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6276,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"He answered, ""Ye have many superstitions which I see are good for nothing."
6277,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"I do not know that men fare better now [Sidenote: p. 149] than before, when"
6278,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,they had nought to do with such things. It seemed to me a better way when
6279,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"men were called heathen; and I want my meat and no tricks."""
6280,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6281,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"The yeoman's wife said, ""I know for a certainty that it will fare ill with"
6282,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"thee today, if thou dost this evil thing."""
6283,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6284,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Glam bade her bring the meat at once, else he said it should be worse for"
6285,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"her. She dared not do otherwise than he willed, and when he had eaten he"
6286,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"went out, foul-mouthed."
6287,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6288,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Now it had gone so with the weather that it was heavy all round, and"
6289,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"snow-flakes were falling, and it was blowing loud, and grew much worse as"
6290,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"the day went on. The shepherd {166} was heard early in the day, but less"
6291,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"later. Then wind began to drive the snow, and towards evening it became a"
6292,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"tempest. Then men came to the service, and so it went on to nightfall. Glam"
6293,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,did not come home. Then there was talk whether search ought not to be made
6294,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"for him, but because there was a tempest and it was pitch dark, no search"
6295,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"was attempted. That Yule night he did not come home, and so men waited till"
6296,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"after the service [next, i.e. Christmas, morning]. But when it was full"
6297,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"day, men went to search, and found the sheep scattered in the"
6298,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"snow-drifts[300], battered by the tempest, or strayed up into the"
6299,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"mountains. Then they came on a great space beaten down, high up in the"
6300,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,valley. It looked to them as if there had been somewhat violent wrestling
6301,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"there, because the stones had been torn up for a distance around, and the"
6302,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,earth likewise. They looked closely and saw where Glam lay a little
6303,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"distance away. He was dead, and blue like Hel and swollen like an ox. They"
6304,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"had great loathing of him, and their souls shuddered at him. Nevertheless"
6305,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"they strove to bring him to the church, but they could get him no further"
6306,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"than the edge of a ravine a little below, and they went home leaving"
6307,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"matters so, and told the yeoman what had happened. He asked what appeared"
6308,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"to have been the death of Glam. They said that, from the trodden spot, up"
6309,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"to a place beneath the rocks high in the valley, they had tracked marks as"
6310,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"big as if a cask-bottom had been stamped down, and great drops of blood"
6311,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"with them. So men concluded from this, that the evil thing which had been"
6312,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"there before must have killed Glam, but Glam must have done it damage which"
6313,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"had been enough, in that nought has ever happened since from that evil"
6314,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,thing.
6315,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6316,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,The second day of Yule it was again essayed to bring Glam to the church.
6317,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6318,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Beasts of draught were harnessed, but they could not move him where it was"
6319,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"level ground and not down hill, so they departed, leaving matters so."
6320,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6321,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"The third day the priest went with them, and they searched [Sidenote: p."
6322,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"150] all day, but Glam could not be found. The priest would go no {167}"
6323,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"more, but Glam was found when the priest was not in the company. Then they"
6324,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"gave up trying to carry him to the church, and buried him where he was,"
6325,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,under a cairn.
6326,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6327,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,A little later men became aware that Glam was not lying quiet. Great harm
6328,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"came to men from this, so that many fell into a swoon when they saw him,"
6329,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"and some could not keep their wits. Just after Yule, men thought they saw"
6330,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"him at home at the farm. They were exceedingly afraid, and many fled away."
6331,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Thereupon Glam took to riding the house-roofs at nights, so that he nearly"
6332,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,broke them in. He walked almost night and day. Men hardly dared to go up
6333,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"into the dale, even though they had business enough. Men in that"
6334,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,country-side thought great harm of this.
6335,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6336,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,In the spring Thorhall got farm-hands together and set up house on his
6337,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,land. Then the apparition began to grow less frequent whilst the sun's
6338,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,course was at its height; and so it went on till midsummer. That summer a
6339,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,ship came out to Hunawater. On it was a man called Thorgaut. He was an
6340,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"outlander by race, big and powerful; he had the strength of two men. He was"
6341,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"in no man's service, and alone, and he wished to take up some work, since"
6342,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"he had no money. Thorhall rode to the ship, and met Thorgaut. He asked him"
6343,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"if he would work for him. Thorgaut said that might well be, and that he"
6344,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,would make no difficulties.
6345,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6346,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"""But thou must be prepared,"" said Thorhall, ""that it is no place for"
6347,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"weaklings, by reason of the hauntings which have been going on for a while,"
6348,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"for I will not let thee into a trap."""
6349,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6350,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Thorgaut answered, ""It does not seem to me that I am undone, even though I"
6351,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,were to see some little ghosts. It must be no easy matter for others if I
6352,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"am frightened, and I will not give up my place for that."""
6353,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6354,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"So now they agreed well, and Thorgaut was to watch the sheep when winter"
6355,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,came.
6356,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6357,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Now the summer passed on. Thorgaut took charge of the sheep at the
6358,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,winter-nights. He was well-pleasing to all. Glam ever came home and rode on
6359,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"the roofs. Thorgaut thought it sporting, and said that the thrall would"
6360,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,have to come nearer {168} in order to scare him. But Thorhall bade him keep
6361,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"quiet: ""It is best that ye should not try your strength together."" Thorgaut"
6362,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"said, ""Verily, your courage is shaken out of you: I shall not drop down"
6363,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"with fear between day and night over such talk."""
6364,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6365,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Now things went on through the winter up to Yule-tide. On Yule evening the
6366,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,shepherd went out to his sheep. Then [Sidenote: p. 151] the yeoman's wife
6367,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"said, ""It is to be hoped that now things will not go in the old way."""
6368,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6369,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"He answered, ""Be not afraid of that, mistress; something worth telling will"
6370,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"have happened if I do not come back."""
6371,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6372,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Then he went to his sheep. The weather was cold, and it snowed much."
6373,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Thorgaut was wont to come home when it was twilight, but now he did not"
6374,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"come at that time. Men came to the service, as was the custom. It seemed to"
6375,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,people that things were going as they had before. The yeoman wished to have
6376,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"search made for the shepherd, but the church-goers excused themselves, and"
6377,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,said they would not risk themselves out in the hands of the trolls by
6378,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"night. And the yeoman did not dare to go, so the search came to nothing."
6379,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6380,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"On Yule-day, when men had eaten, they went and searched for the shepherd."
6381,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"They went first to Glam's cairn, because men thought that the shepherd's"
6382,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,disappearance must have been through his bringing-about. But when they came
6383,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"near the cairn they saw great things, for there they found the shepherd"
6384,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,with his neck broken and not a bone in him whole. Then they carried him to
6385,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"the church, and no harm happened to any man from Thorgaut afterwards; but"
6386,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Glam began to increase in strength anew. He did so much that all men fled
6387,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"away from Thorhall's Farm, except only the yeoman and his wife."
6388,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6389,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Now the same cattle-herd had been there a long time. Thorhall would not let
6390,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"him go, because of his good-will and good service. He was far gone in age"
6391,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,and was very unwilling to leave: he saw that everything went to waste which
6392,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"the yeoman had, if no one looked after it. And once after mid-winter it"
6393,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,happened one morning that the yeoman's wife went to the byre to milk the
6394,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"cows as usual. It was quite light, because no one dared to go out before,"
6395,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,except the cattle-herd: he went {169} out as soon as it dawned. She heard
6396,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"great cracking in the byre and a hideous bellowing. She ran back, crying"
6397,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"out, and said she did not know what devilry was going on in the byre."
6398,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6399,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"The yeoman went out, and came to the cattle, and they were goring each"
6400,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"other. It seemed to him no good to stay there, and he went further into the"
6401,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"hay-barn. He saw where the cattle-herd lay, and he had his head in one"
6402,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,stall and his feet in the next. He lay on his back. The yeoman went to him
6403,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"and felt him. He soon found that he was dead, and his back-bone broken in"
6404,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,two; it had been broken over the partition slab.
6405,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6406,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Now it seemed no longer bearable to Thorhall, and he left his farm with all"
6407,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,that he could carry away; but all the live-stock [Sidenote: p. 152] left
6408,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,behind Glam killed. After that he went through all the dale and laid waste
6409,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,all the farms up from Tongue. Thorhall spent what was left of the winter
6410,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"with his friends. No man could go up into the dale with horse or hound,"
6411,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"because it was slain forthwith. But when spring came, and the course of the"
6412,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"sun was highest, the apparitions abated somewhat. Now Thorhall wished to go"
6413,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"back to his land. It was not easy for him to get servants, but still he set"
6414,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,up house at Thorhall's Farm.
6415,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6416,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,All went the same way as before. When autumn came on the hauntings began to
6417,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"increase. The yeoman's daughter was most attacked, and it fared so that she"
6418,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"died. Many counsels were taken, but nothing was done. Things seemed to men"
6419,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"to be looking as if all Water-dale must be laid waste, unless some remedies"
6420,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,could be found.
6421,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6422,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6423,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6424,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Now the story must be taken up about Grettir, how he sat at home at Bjarg"
6425,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"that autumn, after he had parted from Barthi-of-the-Slayings at Thorey's"
6426,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Peak. And when it had almost come to the winter-nights, Grettir rode from"
6427,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"home, north over the neck to Willow-dale, and was a guest at Authun's Farm."
6428,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"He was fully reconciled to Authun, and gave him a good axe, and they spake"
6429,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,of their wish for friendship one with the other. (Authun dwelt long at
6430,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Authun's Farm, and much goodly offspring had he. Egil was his son, who"
6431,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"wedded Ulfheith, daughter of Eyjolf Guthmundson; and their son was Eyjolf,"
6432,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"who was slain at the All-Thing. He was father of Orm, chaplain to {170}"
6433,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Bishop Thorlak.) Grettir rode north to Water-dale and came on a visit to
6434,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Tongue. At that time Jokul Barthson lived there, Grettir's uncle. Jokul was"
6435,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"a man great and strong and very proud. He was a seafaring man, and very"
6436,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"over-bearing, yet of great account. He received Grettir well, and Grettir"
6437,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,was there three nights.
6438,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6439,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,There was so much said about the apparitions of Glam that nothing was
6440,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,spoken of by men equally with that. Grettir inquired exactly about the
6441,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,events which had happened. Jokul said that nothing more had been spoken
6442,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"than had verily occurred. ""But art thou anxious, kinsman, to go there?"""
6443,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6444,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Grettir said that that was the truth. Jokul begged him not to do so, ""For"
6445,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"that is a great risk of thy luck, and thy kinsmen have much at stake where"
6446,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"thou art,"" said he, ""for none of the young men seems to us to be equal to"
6447,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"thee; but ill will come of ill where Glam is, and it is much better to have"

6510,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"it down under his feet, and twisted the other under his head and looked out"
6511,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,through the head-opening. There was a great and strong partition beam in

6513,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"all broken away from the outer door, but now boards, fastened together"
6514,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"carelessly anyhow, had been tied in front. The panelling which had been in"

6518,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6519,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,A light burned in the hall during the night: and when a third part of the
6520,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"night was past, Grettir heard a great noise outside. Some creature had"
6521,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,mounted upon the buildings and was riding upon the hall and beating it with
6522,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"its heels, so that it cracked in every rafter. This went on a long time."
6523,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Then the creature came down from the buildings and went to the door. When
6524,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"the door was opened Grettir saw that the thrall had stretched in his head,"
6525,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,and it seemed to him monstrously great and wonderfully huge. Glam went
6526,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,slowly and stretched himself up when he came inside the door. He towered up
6527,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,to the roof. He turned and laid his arm upon the cross-beam and glared in
6528,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"upon the hall. The yeoman did not let himself be heard, because the noise"
6529,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,he heard outside seemed to him enough. Grettir lay quiet and did not move.
6530,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6531,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Glam saw that a heap lay upon the seat, and he stalked in up the hall and"
6532,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,gripped the cloak wondrous fast. Grettir pressed his feet against the post
6533,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"and gave not at all. Glam pulled a second time much more violently, and the"
6534,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,cloak did not move. A third time he gripped with both hands so mightily
6535,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"that he pulled Grettir up from the seat, and now the cloak was torn asunder"
6536,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,between them.
6537,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6538,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Glam gazed at the portion which he held, and wondered much who could have"
6539,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,pulled so hard against him; and at that moment Grettir leapt under his arms
6540,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"and grasped him round {173} the middle, and bent his back as mightily as he"
6541,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"could, reckoning that Glam would sink to his knees at his attack. But the"
6542,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,thrall laid such a grip on Grettir's arm that he recoiled at the might of
6543,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"it. Then Grettir gave way from one seat to another. The beams[302] started,"
6544,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,and all that came in their way was broken. [Sidenote: p. 155] Glam wished
6545,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"to get out, but Grettir set his feet against any support he could find;"
6546,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,nevertheless Glam dragged him forward out of the hall. And there they had a
6547,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"sore wrestling, in that the thrall meant to drag him right out of the"
6548,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"building; but ill as it was to have to do with Glam inside, Grettir saw"
6549,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"that it would be yet worse without, and so he struggled with all his might"
6550,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"against going out. Glam put forth all his strength, and dragged Grettir"
6551,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,towards himself when they came to the porch. And when Grettir saw that he
6552,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"could not resist, then all at once he flung himself against the breast of"
6553,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"the thrall, as powerfully as he could, and pressed forward with both his"
6554,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,feet against a stone which stood fast in the earth at the entrance. The
6555,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"thrall was not ready for this, he had been pulling to drag Grettir towards"
6556,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"himself; and thereupon he stumbled on his back out of doors, so that his"
6557,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"shoulders smote against the cross-piece of the door, and the roof clave"
6558,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"asunder, both wood and frozen thatch. So Glam fell backwards out of the"
6559,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,house and Grettir on top of him. There was bright moonshine and broken
6560,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,clouds without. At times they drifted in front of the moon and at times
6561,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"away. Now at the moment when Glam fell, the clouds cleared from before the"
6562,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"moon, and Glam rolled up his eyes; and Grettir himself has said that that"
6563,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,was the one sight he had seen which struck fear into him. Then such a
6564,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"sinking came over Grettir, from his weariness and from that sight of Glam"
6565,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"rolling his eyes, that he had no strength to draw his knife and lay almost"
6566,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,between life and death.

6570,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,But in this was there more power for evil in Glam than in most other

6598,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"day. Grettir lay down, for he was very stiff. Thorhall sent people to the"
6599,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"next farm for men, and showed to them what had happened. To all those who"
6600,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"heard of it, it seemed a work of great account; and that was then spoken by"
6601,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"all, that no man in all the land was equal to Grettir Asmundarson for might"
6602,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,and valour and all prowess. Thorhall sent Grettir from his house with
6603,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"honour, and gave him a good horse and fit clothing; for all the clothes"
6604,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,which he had worn before were torn asunder. They parted great friends.

6631,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,People thought the place was much haunted by reason of the visitation of

6634,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"service, according to her custom, at Isledale river, but her husband"
6635,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"remained at home. In the evening men went to bed, and during the night they"

6637,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"to get up to look to it, because there were very few men about. The"

6693,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"once up against his breast; then it tossed a great icefloe against him, but"
6694,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,he put out the hand that was free and pushed it from him. Then it grew so
6695,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"deep that the river dashed over his shoulder; but he waded stoutly on,"
6696,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"until he came to the bank on the other side, and threw Steinvor and her"
6697,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,daughter on the land.
6698,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6699,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Then he turned back, and it was half dark when he came to Sandhaugar and"
6700,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"called for meat; and when he had eaten, he bade the farm folk go to the far"
6701,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,side of the room. Then he took boards and loose timber which he dragged
6702,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"across the room, and made a great barrier so that none of the farm folk"
6703,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,could come over it. No one dared to say anything against him or to murmur
6704,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,in any wise. The entrance was in the side wall of the chamber by the
6705,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"gable-end, and there was a dais there. Guest lay down there, but did not"
6706,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,take off his clothes: a light was burning in the room over against the
6707,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,door: Guest lay there far into the night.

6711,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"The good-wife came to Isledale river to the service, and men wondered how"
6712,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,she had crossed the river. She said she did not know whether it was a man
6713,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"or a troll who had carried her over. The priest said, ""It must surely be a"
6714,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"man, although there are few like him. And let us say nothing about it,"""
6715,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"said he, ""it may be that he is destined to work a remedy for your evils."""
6716,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,The good-wife remained there through the night.
6717,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6718,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6719,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6720,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Now it is to be told concerning Grettir that when it drew towards midnight
6721,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,he heard great noises outside. Thereupon there came into the room a great
6722,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"giantess. She had in one hand a trough and in the other a short-sword,"
6723,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"rather a big one. She looked round when she came in, and saw where Guest"
6724,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"lay, and sprang at him; but he sprang up against her, and they struggled"
6725,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,fiercely and wrestled for a long time in the room. She was the {178}
6726,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"stronger, but he gave way warily; and they broke all that was before them,"
6727,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,as well as the panelling of the room. She dragged him forward through the
6728,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"door and so[305] into the porch, and he [Sidenote: p. 159] struggled hard"
6729,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"against her. She wished to drag him out of the house, but that did not"
6730,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,happen until they had broken all the fittings of the outer doorway and
6731,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,forced them out on their shoulders. Then she dragged him slowly down
6732,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,towards the river and right along to the gorge.
6733,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6734,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"By that time Guest was exceedingly weary, but yet, one or other it had to"
6735,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"be, either he had to gather his strength together, or else she would have"
6736,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,hurled him down into the gorge. All night they struggled. He thought that
6737,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,he had never grappled with such a devil in the matter of strength. She had
6738,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"got such a grip upon him that he could do nothing with either hand, except"
6739,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,to hold the witch by the middle; but when they came to the gorge of the
6740,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"river he swung the giantess round, and thereupon got his right hand free."
6741,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Then quickly he gripped his knife that he wore in his girdle and drew it,"
6742,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,and smote the shoulder of the giantess so that he cut off her right arm. So
6743,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"he got free: but she fell into the gorge, and so into the rapids below."
6744,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6745,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Guest was then both stiff and tired, and lay long on the rocks; then he"
6746,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"went home when it began to grow light, and lay down in bed. He was all"
6747,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,swollen black and blue.
6748,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6749,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"And when the good-wife came from the service, it seemed to her that things"
6750,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,had been somewhat disarranged in her house. Then she went to Guest and
6751,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"asked him what had happened, that all was broken and destroyed[306]. He"
6752,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"told her all that had taken place. She thought it very wonderful, and asked"
6753,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"who he was. He told her the truth, and asked her to send for the priest,"
6754,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,and said he wished to meet him; and so it was done.
6755,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6756,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Then when Stein the priest came to Sandhaugar, he knew soon that it was"
6757,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Grettir Asmundarson who had come there, and who had called himself Guest."
6758,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6759,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,The priest asked Grettir what he thought must have become of those men who
6760,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,had vanished. Grettir said he thought they {179} must have vanished into
6761,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"the gorge. The priest said that he could not believe Grettir's saying, if"
6762,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,no signs of it were to be seen. Grettir said that they would know more
6763,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,accurately about it later. Then the priest went home. Grettir lay many days
6764,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"in bed. The good-wife looked after him well, and so the Christmas-time"
6765,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,passed.
6766,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6767,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Grettir's account was that the giantess fell into the gulf when she got her
6768,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,wound; but the men of Barthardal say that day came upon her whilst they
6769,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"wrestled, and that she burst when he smote her hand off, and that she"
6770,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"stands there on the cliff yet, a rock in the likeness of a woman[307]."
6771,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6772,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,The dwellers in the dale kept Grettir in hiding there. But after Christmas
6773,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"time, one day that winter, Grettir went to Isledale river. And when Grettir"
6774,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"and the priest met, Grettir [Sidenote: p. 160] said ""I see, priest, that"
6775,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,you place little belief in my words. Now will I that you go with me to the
6776,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"river and see what the likelihood seems to you to be."""
6777,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6778,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,The priest did so. But when they came to the waterfall they saw that the
6779,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,sides of the gorge hung over[308]: it was a sheer cliff so great that one
6780,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"could in nowise come up, and it was nearly ten fathoms[309] from the top to"
6781,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"the water below. They had a rope with them. Then the priest said, ""It seems"
6782,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"to me quite impossible for thee to get down."""
6783,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6784,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Grettir said, ""Assuredly it is possible, but best for those who are men of"
6785,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"valour. I will examine what is in the waterfall, and thou shalt watch the"
6786,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"rope."""
6787,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6788,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,{180}
6789,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6790,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"The priest said it should be as he wished, drove a peg into the cliff,"
6791,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"piled stones against it, and sat by it[310]."
6792,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6793,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Now it must be told concerning Grettir that he knotted a stone into the
6794,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"rope, and so let it down to the water."
6795,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6796,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"""What way,"" said the priest, ""do you mean to go?"""
6797,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6798,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"""I will not be bound,"" said Grettir, ""when I go into the water, so much my"
6799,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"mind forebodes me."""
6800,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6801,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"After that he got ready for his exploit, and had little on; he girded"
6802,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"himself with his short sword, and had no other weapon."
6803,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6804,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Then he plunged from the cliff down into the waterfall. The priest saw the
6805,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"soles of his feet, and knew no more what had become of him. Grettir dived"
6806,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"under the waterfall, and that was difficult because there was a great eddy,"
6807,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,and he had to dive right to the bottom before he could come up behind the
6808,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,waterfall. There was a jutting rock and he climbed upon it. There was a
6809,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"great cave behind the waterfall, and the river fell in front of it from the"
6810,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"precipice. He went into the cave, and there was a big fire burning. Grettir"
6811,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,saw that there sat a giant of frightful size. He was terrible to look upon:
6812,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"but when Grettir came to him, the giant leapt up and seized a pike, and"
6813,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,hewed at the new-comer: for with the pike he could both cut and stab. It
6814,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,had a handle of wood: men at that time called a weapon made in such a way a
6815,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"_heptisax_. Grettir smote against it with his short sword, and struck the"
6816,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,handle so that he cut it asunder. Then the giant tried to reach back for a
6817,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,sword which hung behind him in the cave. Thereupon Grettir smote him in the
6818,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"breast, and struck off almost all the lower part of his chest and his"
6819,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"belly, so that the entrails gushed out of him down into the river, and were"
6820,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,swept along the current.
6821,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6822,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"And as the priest sat by the rope he saw some lumps, clotted [Sidenote: p."
6823,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"161] with blood, carried down stream. Then he became unsteady, and thought"
6824,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,that now he knew that Grettir must be dead: and he ran from keeping the
6825,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"rope and went home. It was then evening, and the priest said for certain"
6826,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"that Grettir was dead, and added that it was a great loss of such a man."
6827,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6828,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Now the tale must be told concerning Grettir. He let little space go
6829,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,between his blows till the giant was dead. Then he {181} went further into
6830,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,the cave; he kindled a light and examined it. It is not said how much
6831,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"wealth he took in the cave, but men think that there was something. He"
6832,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"stayed there far into the night. He found there the bones of two men, and"
6833,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,put them into a bag. Then he left the cave and swam to the rope and shook
6834,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"it, for he thought that the priest must be there. But when he knew that the"
6835,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"priest had gone home, then he had to draw himself up, hand over hand, and"
6836,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,so he came up on to the cliff.
6837,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6838,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Then he went home to Isledale river, and came to the church porch, with the"
6839,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"bag that the bones were in, and with a rune-staff, on which these verses"
6840,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,were exceedingly well cut:
6841,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6842,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"There into gloomy gulf I passed,"
6843,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,O'er which from the rock's throat is cast
6844,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"The swirling rush of waters wan,"
6845,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,To meet the sword-player feared of man.
6846,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,By giant's hall the strong stream pressed
6847,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Cold hands against the singer's breast;
6848,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Huge weight upon him there did hurl
6849,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,The swallower of the changing whirl[311].
6850,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6851,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,And this rhyme too:
6852,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6853,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,The dreadful dweller of the cave
6854,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Great strokes and many 'gainst me drave;
6855,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"Full hard he had to strive for it,"
6856,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,But toiling long he wan no whit;
6857,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,For from its mighty shaft of tree
6858,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,The heft-sax smote I speedily;
6859,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,And dulled the flashing war-flame fair
6860,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,In the black breast that met me there.
6861,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6862,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,[Sidenote: p. 162]
6863,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6864,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,These verses told also that Grettir had taken these bones out of the cave.
6865,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"But when the priest came to the church in the morning he found the staff,"
6866,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,"and what was with it, and read the runes; but Grettir had gone home to"
6867,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Sandhaugar.
6868,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6869,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,But when the priest met Grettir he asked him closely as to what had
6870,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,happened: and Grettir told him all the story of his journey. And he added
6871,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,that the priest had not watched the rope faithfully. The priest said that
6872,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,that was true enough.
6873,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6874,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,Men thought for certain that these monsters must have caused the loss of
6875,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,men there in the dale; and there was never any loss from hauntings or
6876,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,spirit-walkings there afterwards.
6877,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,
6878,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,{182} Grettir was thought to have caused a great purging of the land. The
6879,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM GRETTIS SAGA,priest buried these bones in the churchyard.

7011,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM BJARKA RÍMUR,"cunning in speech. One day Hjalti and Bothvar went out of the hall, in such"

7013,TRANSLATION OF EXTRACTS FROM BJARKA RÍMUR,

7061,"IV, 58-64.",
7062,"IV, 58-64.",12. That was the beginning of his exploits: many followed later; his spirit
7063,"IV, 58-64.",was ever excellent amid the play of battle.
7064,"IV, 58-64.",

7363,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"And he made himself ready forthwith for the expedition, took a touching"
7364,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"farewell of his lord and king, and said among other things: ""My lord, if I"
7365,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"come not back, care thou for my wife and my children."""
7366,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,
7367,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"Afterwards, when he crossed over to Vendsyssel, he caused the peasants to"
7368,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"show him the place where the monster had its lair, and learnt how that very"
7369,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"day the drake had been out of its den, and had carried off a herdsman and"
7370,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"an ox; how, according to its wont, it would now not come out for three"
7371,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"hours, when it would want to go down to the water to drink after its meal."
7372,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"Henry clothed himself in full armour, and inasmuch as no one dared to stand"
7373,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"by him in that task, he lay down all alone by the water, but in such wise"
7374,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,that the wind did not blow from him toward the monster. First of all he
7375,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"sent a mighty arrow from his bow: but, although it exactly hit the spot at"
7376,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"which he had aimed, it darted back from the dragon's hard scales. At this"
7377,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"the monster was so maddened, that it attacked him forthwith, reckoning him"
7378,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,but a little meal. But Henry had had a mighty barbed crook prepared by a
7379,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"smith beforehand, which he thrust into the beast's open mouth, so that it"
7380,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"could {195} not get rid of it, however much it strove, although the iron"
7381,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,rod broke in Henry's hands. Then it smote him to the ground with its mighty
7382,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"tail, and although he was in complete armour, clutched at him with its"
7383,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"dread claws, so that he fell in a swoon, wounded almost to death. But when"
7384,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"he came somewhat to his senses again, after the drake for some time had had"
7385,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"him lying under its belly, he rallied his last strength and grasped a"
7386,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"dagger, of which he carried several with him in his belt, and smote it"
7387,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"therewith in the belly, where the scales were weakest. So the monster at"
7388,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"last breathed out its poisoned breath, whilst he himself lay half crushed"
7389,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"under its weight. When the Vendsyssel peasants, who stood some distance"
7390,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"away, in great fear and little hope, at last noticed that the battle had"
7391,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"slackened, and that both combatants were still, they drew near and found"
7392,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,Henry almost lifeless under the slain monster. And after they for some time
7393,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"had tended him well, he returned to die by his king, to whom he again"
7394,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"commended his offspring. From him descends the family Lindenroth, which in"
7395,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,memory of this mighty contest carries a drake on its coat of arms.
7396,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,
7397,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"This story resembles the dragon fight in _Beowulf_, in that the hero"
7398,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"faces the dragon as protector of the land, with forebodings, and after"
7399,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"taking farewell; he attacks the dragon in its lair, single-handed; his"
7400,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,first attack is frustrated by the dragon's scales; in spite of
7401,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,"apparatus specially prepared, he is wounded and stunned by the dragon,"
7402,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,but nevertheless smites the dragon in the soft parts and slays him; the
7403,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,watchers draw near when the fight is over. Yet these things merely
7404,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,prove that the two stories are of the same type; there is no evidence
7405,A DANISH DRAGON-SLAYING OF THE BEOWULF-TYPE.,that this story is descended from _Beowulf_.

7423,I. _THE MERCIAN GENEALOGY_.,"By noting where these lists stop, we get a limit for the final compilation"

7426,I. _THE MERCIAN GENEALOGY_.,and some of them were even at that date old. For the genealogy of the
7427,I. _THE MERCIAN GENEALOGY_.,"Mercian kings, from Woden, is not traced directly down to this period"
7428,I. _THE MERCIAN GENEALOGY_.,"811-814, but in the first place only as far as Æthelred (reigning 675-704),"

7432,I. _THE MERCIAN GENEALOGY_.,"Cenwulf, king of Mercia (reigning 796-821). It is difficult to account for"
7433,I. _THE MERCIAN GENEALOGY_.,such an arrangement except on the hypothesis that the genealogy was

7437,I. _THE MERCIAN GENEALOGY_.,when we find that precisely the same arrangement holds good for the

7439,I. _THE MERCIAN GENEALOGY_.,"(670-685), the contemporary of Æthelred of Mercia, and is then brought up"

7445,I. _THE MERCIAN GENEALOGY_.,traces of having been originally drawn up in the time of Æthelred of Mercia
7446,I. _THE MERCIAN GENEALOGY_.,"(675-704) or possibly of his father Penda, and of having then been brought"

9294,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,
9295,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,The _Finnsburg Fragment_ was discovered two centuries ago in the library of
9296,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"Lambeth Palace by George Hickes. It was written on a single leaf, which was"
9297,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,transcribed and published by Hickes: but the leaf is not now to be found.
9298,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"This is to be regretted for reasons other than sentimental, since Hickes'"
9299,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,transcript is far from accurate[423].
9300,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,
9301,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,The _Fragment_ begins and breaks off in the middle of a line: but possibly
9302,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,not much has been lost at the beginning. For the {246} first lines of the

9304,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"arms within the hall, as the watcher sees the foes approach. It was with"
9305,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"such a call that the _Bjarkamál_, the poem on the death of Rolf Kraki,"
9306,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"began: ""a good call to work"" as a fighting king-saint thought it[424]. It"
9307,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,is with a similar summons to business that the _Finnsburg Fragment_ begins.
9308,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,The watchman has warned the king within the hall that he sees lights
9309,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,approaching--so much we can gather from the two and a half words which are

9312,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"woe; to arms, my men."" And the defending warriors take their posts: at the"
9313,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"one door Sigeferth and Eaha: at the other Ordlaf and Guthlaf, and Hengest"
9314,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,himself[425].
9315,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,
9316,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"Then the poet turns to the foes, as they approach for the attack. The text"
9317,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,as reported by Hickes is difficult: but it seems that Garulf[426] is the
9318,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"name of the warrior about to lead the assault on the hall. Another warrior,"
9319,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"Guthere, whether a friend, kinsman, or retainer[427] we do not know, is"
9320,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"dissuading him, urging him not to risk so precious a life in the first"
9321,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"brunt. But Garulf pays no heed; he challenges the champion on guard: ""Who"
9322,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"is it who holds the door?"""
9323,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,
9324,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"""Sigeferth is my name,"" comes the reply, ""Prince I am of the Secgan: a"

9326,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"endured: from me canst thou have what thou seekest."""
9327,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,
9328,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"So the clash of arms begins: and the first to fall is Garulf, son of"

9337,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"of the men at arms fell: but they held the doors."" After a few more lines"
9338,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,the piece breaks off.
9339,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,
9340,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"There are many textual difficulties here. But these, for the most part, do"
9341,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"not affect the actual narrative, which is a story of clear and"
9342,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,straightforward fighting. It is when we try to fit this narrative into
9343,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,relationship with the _Episode_ in _Beowulf_ that our troubles begin.
9344,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,Within the _Fragment_ itself one difficulty only need at present be
9345,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,mentioned. Guthlaf is one of the champions defending the hall. Yet the
9346,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"leader of the assault, Garulf, is spoken of as Guthlaf's son. Of course it"
9347,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,is possible that we have here a tragic incident parallel to the story of
9348,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,Hildebrand and Hadubrand: father and son may have been separated through
9349,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"earlier misadventures, and now find themselves engaged on opposite sides."
9350,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"This would harmonize with the atmosphere of the _Finnsburg_ story, which is"
9351,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"one of slaughter breaking out among men near of kin, so that afterwards an"
9352,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,uncle and a nephew are burnt on the same pyre. And it has been noted[428]
9353,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"that Garulf rushes to the attack only after he has asked ""Who holds the"
9354,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"door?"" and has learnt that it is Sigeferth: Guthlaf had gone to the"
9355,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,opposite door. Can Garulf's question mean that he knows his father Guthlaf
9356,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"to be inside the hall, and wishes to avoid conflict with him? Possibly; but"
9357,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,I do not think we can argue much from this double appearance of the name
9358,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,Guthlaf. It is possible that the occurrence of Guthlaf as Garulf's father
9359,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"is simply a scribal error. For, puzzling as the tradition of _Finnsburg_"
9360,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"everywhere is, it is peculiarly puzzling in its proper names, which are"
9361,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,mostly given in forms that seem to have undergone some alteration. And even
9362,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,"if _G[=u]ðl[=a]fes sunu_ be correctly written, it is possible that the"
9363,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,Guthlaf who is father of Garulf is not to be identified with the Guthlaf
9364,SECTION I. THE FINNSBURG FRAGMENT,whom Garulf is besieging within the hall[429].

9382,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,enumerated. There are none of the dramatic speeches which we find in the
9383,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"_Fragment_. It is evident that the tale has been reduced in scope, in order"

9390,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9391,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,For never can true reconcilement grow
9392,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,Where wounds of deadly hate have struck so deep.
9393,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9394,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,It is on this note that the _Episode_ in _Beowulf_ begins: with the tragic
9395,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,figure of Hildeburh. Hildeburh is closely related to both contending
9396,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"parties. She is sister to Hnæf, prince of the ""Half-Danes,"" and she is"
9397,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"wedded to Finn, king of the Frisians. Whatever may be obscure in the story,"
9398,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,it is clear that a fight has taken place between the men of Hnæf and those
9399,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"of Finn, and that Hnæf has been slain: probably by Finn directly, though"
9400,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,perhaps by his followers[430]. A son of Finn has also fallen.
9401,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9402,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,With regard to the peoples concerned there are difficulties. Finn's
9403,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Frisians are presumably the main Frisian race, dwelling in and around the"
9404,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,district still known as Friesland; for in the Catalogue of Kings in
9405,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"_Widsith_ it is said that ""Finn Folcwalding {249} ruled the kin of the"
9406,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Frisians[431]."" Hnæf and his people are called Half-Danes, Danes and"
9407,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,Scyldings; Hnæf is therefore presumably related to the Danish royal house.
9408,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"But, in no account which has come down to us of that house, are Hnæf or his"
9409,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"father Hoc ever mentioned as kings or princes of Denmark, and their"
9410,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"connection with the family of Hrothgar, the great house of Scyldings who"
9411,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"ruled Denmark from the capital of Leire, remains obscure. In _Widsith_, the"
9412,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"people ruled over by Hnæf are called ""children of Hoc"" (_H[=o]cingum_), and"
9413,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"are mentioned immediately after the ""Sea-Danes[432]."""
9414,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9415,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Then there is a mysterious people called the _Eotens_, upon whom is placed"
9416,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"the blame of the struggle: ""Verily Hildeburh had little reason to praise"
9417,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"the good faith of the Eotens."" This is the typical understatement of Old"
9418,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,English rhetoric: it can only point to deliberate treachery on the part of
9419,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,the Eotens. Our interpretation of the poem will therefore hinge largely
9420,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,upon our interpretation of this name. There have been two views as to the
9421,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Eotens. The one view holds them to be Hnæf's Danes, and consequently places"
9422,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"on Hnæf the responsibility for the aggression. This theory is, I think,"
9423,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"quite wrong, and has been the cause of much confusion: but it has been held"
9424,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,by scholars of great weight[433]. The other view regards the Eotens as
9425,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,subjects {250} of Finn and foes of Hnæf. This view has been more generally
9426,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"held, and it is, as I shall try to show, only along these lines that a"
9427,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,satisfactory solution can be found.
9428,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9429,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9430,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9431,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"The poet continues of the woes of Hildeburh. ""Guiltless, she lost at the"
9432,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"war those whom she loved, child and brother. They fell as was fated,"
9433,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"wounded by the spear, and a sad lady was she. Not for naught did the"
9434,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"daughter of Hoc [i.e. Hildeburh] bewail her fate when morning came, when"

9436,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9437,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Then the poet turns to the figure of Finn, king of the Frisians. His cause"
9438,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,for grief is as deep as that of Hildeburh. For he has lost that body of
9439,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"retainers which to a Germanic chief, even as to King Arthur, was dearer"
9440,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"than a wife[434]. ""War swept away all the retainers of Finn, except some"
9441,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"few."""
9442,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9443,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"What follows is obscure, but as to the general drift there is no doubt."
9444,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"After the death of their king Hnæf, the besieged Danes are led by Hengest."
9445,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Hengest must be Hnæf's retainer, for he is expressly so called (_þ[=e]odnes"
9446,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"þegn_) ""the king's thegn."" So able is the defence of Hengest, and so heavy"
9447,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"the loss among Finn's men, that Finn has to come to terms. Peace is made"
9448,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"between Finn and Hengest, and the terms are given fully in the _Episode_."
9449,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Unfortunately, owing to the confusion of pronouns, we soon lose our way"
9450,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"amidst the clauses of this treaty, and it becomes exceedingly difficult to"
9451,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"say who are the people who are alluded to as ""they."" This is peculiarly"
9452,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"unlucky because here again the critical word _Eotena_ occurs, but amid such"
9453,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"a tangle of ""thems"" and ""theys"" that it is not easy to tell from this"
9454,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,passage to which side the Eotens belong[435].
9455,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9456,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,But one thing in the treaty is indisputable. In the midst of these
9457,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"complicated clauses, it is said of the Danes, the retainers {251} of Hnæf,"
9458,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,that they are not to be taunted with a certain fact: or perhaps it may be
9459,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"that they are not, when speaking amongst themselves, to remind each other"
9460,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"of a certain fact. However that may be, what _is_ clear is the _fact_, the"
9461,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"mention of which is barred. Nothing is to be said of it, even though ""_they"
9462,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"were following the slayer (bana) of their lord, being without a prince,"
9463,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"since they were compelled so to do_."" Here, at least, are two lines about"
9464,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,the interpretation of which we can be certain: and I shall therefore return
9465,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"to them. We must be careful, however, to remember that the word _bana_,"
9466,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"""slayer,"" conveys no idea of fault or criminality. It is a quite neutral"
9467,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"word, although it has frequently been mistranslated ""murderer,"" and has"
9468,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,thus helped to encourage the belief that Finn slew Hnæf by treachery. Of
9469,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,course it conveys no such implication: _bana_ can be applied to one who
9470,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,slays another in self-defence: it implies neither the one thing nor the
9471,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,other.
9472,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9473,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Then the poet turns to the funeral of the dead champions, who are burned on"
9474,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,one pyre by the now reconciled foes. The bodies of Hnæf and of the son (or
9475,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"sons)[436] of Hildeburh are placed together, uncle and nephew side by side,"
9476,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,whilst Hildeburh stands by lamenting.
9477,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9478,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Then, we are told, the warriors, deprived of their friends, departed to"
9479,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Friesland, to their homes and to their high-city."
9480,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9481,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Hengest still continued to dwell for the whole of that winter with Finn,"
9482,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,and could not return home because of the winter storms. But when spring
9483,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"came and the bosom of the earth became fair, there came also the question"
9484,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,of Hengest's departure: but he thought more of vengeance than of his
9485,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"sea-journey: ""If he might bring about that hostile meeting which he kept in"
9486,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"his mind concerning the child (or children) of the Eotens."" Here again the"
9487,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"word _Eotena_ is used ambiguously, but, I think, this time not without some"
9488,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,indication of its meaning. It has indeed been urged that the child or
9489,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"children of the Eotens are Hnæf, and any other Danes who may have fallen"
9490,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"with him, and that when it is said that Hengest keeps them in mind, it is"
9491,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,meant that he is remembering his fallen comrades with a view to taking
9492,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"{252} vengeance for them. But this would be a queer way of speaking, as"
9493,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,Hengest and his living comrades would on this theory be also themselves
9494,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,children of the Eotens[437]. We should therefore need the term to be
9495,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"further defined: ""children of the Eotens _who fell at Finnsburg_."" It seems"
9496,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"far more likely, from the way in which the expression is used here, that"
9497,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,the children of the Eotens are the people _upon_ whom Hengest intends to
9498,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,take vengeance.
9499,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9500,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Then, we are further told, Hunlafing places in the bosom of Hengest a sword"
9501,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,of which the edges were well known amongst the Eotens. Here again there has
9502,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"been ambiguity, dispute and doubt. Hunlafing has been even bisected into a"
9503,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"chief ""Hun,"" and a sword ""Lafing"" which ""Hun"" is supposed to have placed in"
9504,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"the bosom of Hengest (or of someone else). Upon this act of ""Hun"" many an"
9505,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"interpretation has been placed, and many a theory built. Fortunately it has"
9506,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"become possible, by a series of rather extraordinary discoveries, such as"
9507,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"we had little reason to hope for at this time of day, to put Hunlafing"
9508,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,together again. We now know (and this I think should be regarded as outside
9509,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,the region of controversy) that the warrior who put the sword into
9510,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Hengest's bosom _was_ Hunlafing. And about Hunlafing we gather, though very"
9511,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"little, yet enough to help us. He is apparently a Dane, the son of Hunlaf,"
9512,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,and Hunlaf is the brother of the two champions Guthlaf and Ordlaf[438]. Now
9513,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Guthlaf and Ordlaf, as we know from the _Fragment_, were in the hall"
9514,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"together {253} with Hengest: it was ""Guthlaf, Ordlaf and Hengest himself"""
9515,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,who undertook the defence of one of the doors against the assailants.
9516,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,Guthlaf and Ordlaf were apparently sons of the king of Denmark. As
9517,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Scyldings they would be Hnæf's kinsmen, and accompanied him to his meeting"
9518,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"with Finn. Hunlafing, then, is a nephew of two champions who were attacked"
9519,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"in the hall, and it is possible, though we cannot prove this, that his"
9520,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"father Hunlaf was himself also in the hall, and was slain in the"
9521,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"struggle[439]. At any rate, when Hunlaf's son places a sword in the bosom"
9522,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"of Hengest, this can only mean one thing. It means mischief. The placing of"
9523,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"the sword, by a prince, in the bosom of another, is a symbol of"
9524,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,war-service. It means that Hengest has accepted obligations to a Danish
9525,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"lord, a Scylding, a kinsman of the dead Hnæf, and consequently that he"
9526,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,means to break the troth which he has sworn to Finn.
9527,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9528,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Further, we are told concerning the sword, that its edges were well known"
9529,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"amongst the Eotens. At first sight this might seem, and to many has seemed,"
9530,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"an ambiguous phrase, for a sword may be well known amongst either friends"
9531,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,or foes. The old poets loved nothing better than to dwell upon the
9532,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"adornments of a sword, to say how a man, by reason of a fine sword which"
9533,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"had been given to him, was honoured amongst his associates at table[440]."
9534,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"But if this had been the poet's meaning here, he would surely have dwelt,"
9535,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"not upon the edges of the sword, but upon its gold-adorned hilt, or its"
9536,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,jewelled pommel. When he says the _edges_ of the sword were well known
9537,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"amongst the Eotens, this seems to convey a hostile meaning. We know that"
9538,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,the ill-faith of the Eotens was the cause of the trouble. The phrase about
9539,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,the sword seems therefore to mean that Hengest used this sword in order to
9540,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"take vengeance on the Eotens, presumably for their treachery."
9541,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9542,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"The _Eotenas_, therefore, far from being the men of Hnæf and Hengest, must"
9543,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,have been their foes.
9544,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,
9545,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Then the poet goes on to tell how ""Dire sword-bale came upon the valiant"
9546,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"Finn likewise."" The Danes fell upon Finn at {254} his own home, reddened"
9547,SECTION II. THE EPISODE IN BEOWULF,"the floor of his hall with the life-blood of his men, slew him, plundered"

9555,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9556,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,Now our first task is to find what is the relation between the events told
9557,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,in the _Fragment_ and the events told in the _Episode_ in _Beowulf_. It
9558,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"can, I think, be shown that the events of the _Fragment_ precede the events"
9559,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"of the _Episode_ in _Beowulf_; that is to say that the fight in the hall,"
9560,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"of which we are told in the _Fragment_, is the same fight which has taken"
9561,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"place before the _Episode_ in _Beowulf_ begins, the fight which has"
9562,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"resulted in the slaughter over which Hildeburh laments, and which"
9563,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,necessitates the great funeral described in the first part of the _Episode_
9564,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,(ll. 1108-24).
9565,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9566,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"How necessary it is to place the _Fragment_ here, before the beginning of"
9567,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"the _Episode_, will be best seen, I think, if we examine the theory which"
9568,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,has tried to place it elsewhere.
9569,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9570,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"This is the theory, worked out elaborately and ingeniously by Möller[441],"
9571,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"a theory which has had considerable vogue, and many of the assumptions of"
9572,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"which have been widely accepted. According to Möller and his followers, the"
9573,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,story ran something like this:
9574,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9575,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"""Finn, king of the Frisians, had carried off Hildeburh, daughter of Hoc"
9576,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"(1076), probably with her consent. Her father Hoc seems to have pursued"
9577,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"the fugitives, and to have been slain in the fight which ensued on his"
9578,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"overtaking them. After the lapse of some twenty years, the brothers"
9579,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"Hnæf and Hengest, Hoc's sons, were old enough to undertake the duty of"
9580,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,avenging their father's death. They make an inroad into Finn's
9581,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"country."""
9582,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9583,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"Up to this, all is Möller's hypothesis, unsupported by any evidence, either"
9584,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"in the _Fragment_ or the _Episode_. It is based, so far as it has any real"
9585,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"foundation, upon a mythical interpretation of Finn, and upon parallels with"
9586,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"the Hild-story, the Gudrun-story, and a North Frisian folk-tale[442]. Some"
9587,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"of the {255} parallels are striking, but they are not sufficient to justify"
9588,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,Möller's reconstruction. The authenticity of large portions of the
9589,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,folk-tale is open to doubt[443]: and these portions are vital to any
9590,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,parallel with the story of _Finnsburg_; whilst we have no right to read
9591,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"into the Finn story details from the Hild or Gudrun stories, unless we can"
9592,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,show that they are really versions of the same tale: and this cannot be
9593,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,shown. Möller's suppositions as to the events before the _Episode_ in
9594,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"_Beowulf_ opens, must therefore be dismissed. Möller's reconstruction then"
9595,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"gets into relation with the real story, as narrated in _Beowulf_:"
9596,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9597,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"""A battle takes place in which many warriors, among them Hnæf and a son"
9598,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"of Finn (1074, 1079, 1115), are killed. Peace is therefore solemnly"
9599,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"concluded, and the slain warriors are burnt (1068-1124)."
9600,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9601,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,As the year is too far advanced for Hengest to return home (ll. 1130
9602,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"ff.), he and those of his men who survive remain for the winter in the"
9603,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,Frisian country with Finn. But Hengest's thoughts dwell constantly on
9604,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"the death of his brother Hnæf, and he would gladly welcome any excuse"
9605,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,to break the peace which has been sworn by both parties. His
9606,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"ill-concealed desire for revenge is noticed by the Frisians, who"
9607,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,anticipate it by themselves taking the initiative and attacking Hengest
9608,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,and his men whilst they are sleeping in the hall. _This is the night
9609,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,attack described in the Fragment._ It would seem that after a brave and
9610,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"desperate resistance Hengest himself falls in this fight[444], but two"
9611,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"of his retainers, Guthlaf and Oslaf[444], succeed in cutting their way"
9612,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,through their enemies and in escaping to their own land. They return
9613,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"with fresh troops, attack and slay Finn, and carry his queen Hildeburh"
9614,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"off with them (1125-1159)[445]."""
9615,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9616,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"Now the difficulties of this theory will, I think, be found to be"
9617,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,insuperable. Let us look at some of them.
9618,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9619,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,Möller's view rests upon his interpretation of the Eotens as the men of
9620,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"Hnæf[446]. Since the Eotens are the aggressors, he _has_ consequently to"
9621,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"invent the opening, which makes Hnæf and Hengest the invaders of Finn's"
9622,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,country: and he _has_ therefore to relegate the _Fragment_ (in which Hnæf's
9623,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,men are clearly not the attacking party but the attacked) to a later stage
9624,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,in the story. But we have already seen that this interpretation of the
9625,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,Eotens as the men of Hnæf is not the natural one.
9626,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9627,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"Further, the assumption that Hnæf and Hengest are brothers, though still"
9628,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"frequently met with[447], is surely not justifiable. {256} There is nothing"
9629,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"which demands any such relationship, and there is much which definitely"
9630,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"excludes it. _After Hnæf's death_, Hengest is described as the thegn of"
9631,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"Hnæf: an expression without parallel or explanation, if he was really his"
9632,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"brother and successor. Again, we are expressly told in the _Episode_ that"
9633,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"the Danish retainers make terms with Finn, _the slayer of their lord, being"
9634,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"without a prince_. How could this be said, if Hengest was now their lord"
9635,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"and prince? These lines are, as we have seen, one of the few clear and"
9636,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,indisputable things in the poem. An interpretation which contradicts them
9637,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"flatly, by making Hengest the lord of the Danish retainers, seems"
9638,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,self-condemned.
9639,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9640,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"Again, in _Beowulf_, the poet dwells upon the blameless sorrows of"
9641,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,Hildeburh. We gather that she wakes up in the morning to find that the
9642,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"kinsfolk whom she loves have, during the night, come to blows. ""Innocent,"
9643,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"she lost son and brother[448]--a sad lady she."" Are such expressions"
9644,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"natural, if Hildeburh had eloped with Finn, and her father had in"
9645,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,consequence been slain by him some twenty years before? If she has taken
9646,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"that calmly, and continued to live happily with Finn, would her equanimity"
9647,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,be so seriously disturbed by the slaughter of a brother in addition?
9648,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9649,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,But these difficulties are nothing compared to the further difficulties
9650,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,which Möller's adherents have to face when they proceed to find a place for
9651,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"the night attack as told in the _Fragment_, in the middle of the _Episode_"
9652,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"in _Beowulf_, i.e. between lines 1145 and 1146. In the first place we have"
9653,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,no right to postulate that such important events could have been passed
9654,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,over in silence in the summary of the story as given in _Beowulf_. For
9655,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,Möller has to assume that after the reconciliation between Hengest and
9656,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"Finn, Finn broke his pledges, attacked Hengest by night, slew most of the"
9657,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"men who were with him, including perhaps Hengest himself; and that the"
9658,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"_Beowulf_-poet nevertheless omitted all reference to these events, though"
9659,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"they occur in the midst of the story, and are essential to an understanding"
9660,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,of it.
9661,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9662,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"But even apart from this initial difficulty, we find that by no process of"
9663,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,explaining _can_ we make the night attack narrated {257} in the _Fragment_
9664,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,fit in at the point where Möller places it. In the night attack the men are
9665,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"called to arms by a ""war-young king."" This ""war-young king"" cannot be, as"
9666,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"Möller supposes, Hengest, for the simple reason that Hengest, as I have"
9667,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"tried to show above, far from being the brother of Hnæf, and his successor"
9668,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"as king, is his servant and thegn. The king can only be Hnæf. But Hnæf has"
9669,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,already been slain before the _Episode_ begins: and this makes it
9670,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,impossible to place the _Fragment_ (in which Hnæf appears) in the middle of
9671,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"the _Episode_. Further, it is said in the _Fragment_ that never did"
9672,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,retainers repay a lord better than did his men repay Hnæf. Now these words
9673,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,would only be possible if the retainers were fighting for their lord; that
9674,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"is, either defending him alive or avenging him dead. But Möller's theory"
9675,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,assumes that we are dealing with a period when the retainers have
9676,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"definitely left the service of their lord Hnæf, after his death, and have"
9677,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"entered the service of his slayer, Finn. They have thus dissolved all bonds"
9678,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,with their former lord: they have taken Finn's money and become _his_ men.
9679,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,If Finn then turns upon his new retainers and treacherously tries to slay
9680,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"them, it might be said that the retainers defended their own lives stoutly:"
9681,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,but it would be far-fetched to say that in doing so they repaid their lord
9682,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"Hnæf. Their lord, according to Möller's view, is no longer Hnæf, but Finn,"
9683,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,who is seeking their lives.
9684,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,
9685,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,"Against such difficulties as these it is impossible to make headway, and we"
9686,SECTION III. MÖLLER'S THEORY,must therefore turn to some more possible view of the situation[449].

9691,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,
9692,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"Let us therefore examine the second theory, which is more particularly"
9693,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"associated with the name of Bugge, though it was the current theory before"
9694,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"his time, and has been generally accepted since."
9695,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,
9696,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"According to this view, the _Eotenas_ are the men of Finn, and since upon"
9697,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"them is placed the blame for the trouble, it {258} must be Finn that makes"
9698,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"a treacherous attack upon his wife's brother Hnæf, who is his guest in"
9699,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,Finnsburg[450]. This is the fight of which the _Fragment_ gives us the
9700,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"beginning. Hnæf is slain, and then follow the events as narrated in the"
9701,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"_Episode_: the treaty which Finn makes with Hengest, the leader of the"
9702,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,survivors: and the ultimate vengeance taken upon Finn by these survivors.
9703,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,
9704,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"Here I think we are getting nearer to facts, nearer to a view which can"
9705,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"command general acceptance: at any rate, in so far as the fight narrated in"
9706,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,the _Fragment_ is placed before the beginning of the _Episode_ in
9707,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,_Beowulf_. Positive evidence that this is the right place for the
9708,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"_Fragment_ is scanty, yet not altogether lacking. After all, the fight in"
9709,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"the _Fragment_ is a night attack, and the fight which precedes the"
9710,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"_Episode_ in _Beowulf_, as I have tried to show, is a night attack[451]."
9711,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,But our reason for putting the _Fragment_ before the commencement of the
9712,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,_Episode_ is mainly negative: it lies in the insuperable difficulties which
9713,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,meet us when we try to place it anywhere else.
9714,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,
9715,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"But, it will be objected, there are difficulties also in placing the"
9716,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,_Fragment_ before the _Episode_. Perhaps: but I do not think these
9717,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,difficulties will be found to survive examination.
9718,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,
9719,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,The first objection to supposing that the _Fragment_ narrates the same
9720,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"fight as precedes the _Episode_ is, that the fight in the _Fragment_ takes"
9721,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"place at Finnsburg[452], whilst the fight which precedes the _Episode_"
9722,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,apparently takes place away from Finn's capital: for after the fighting is
9723,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"over, the dead burned, and the treaty made, the warriors depart ""to see"
9724,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"Friesland, their homes, and their high-town (_h[=e]a-burh_)[453]."""
9725,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,
9726,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,{259}
9727,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,
9728,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,But I do not see that this involves us in any difficulty. It is surely
9729,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,quite reasonable that Finnsburg--Finn's castle--where the first fight takes
9730,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"place, is not, and was never meant to be, the same as Finn's capital, his"
9731,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"_h[=e]aburh_, his ""own home."" After all, when a king's name is given to a"
9732,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"town, the presumption is rather that the town is _not_ his capital, but"
9733,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,some new settlement built in a newly acquired territory. _[=E]adwinesburh_
9734,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,was not the capital of King Eadwine: it was the stronghold which he held
9735,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,against the Picts on the outskirts of his realm. Aosta was not the capital
9736,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"of Augustus, nor Fort William of William III, nor Harounabad of Haroun al"
9737,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,Raschid. So here: we know that the chief town of the Frisians was not
9738,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"Finnsburg, but Dorestad: ""Dorostates of the Frisians[454]."" The fight may"
9739,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"have taken place at some outlying castle built by Finn, and named after him"
9740,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"_Finnsburg_: then he returned, we are told, to his _h[=e]aburh_: and it is"
9741,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"here, _æt his sylfes h[=a]m_, ""in his own home"" (the poet himself seems to"
9742,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,emphasize a distinction) that destruction in the end comes upon him. There
9743,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,is surely no difficulty here.
9744,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,
9745,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,A second discrepancy has often been indicated. In the _Fragment_ the fight
9746,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,lasts five days before any one of the defenders fall: in the _Episode_ (it
9747,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,is argued) Hildeburh in the morning finds her brother slain[455]. Even were
9748,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"this so, I do not know that it need trouble us much. In a detail like this,"
9749,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"which {260} does not go to the heart of the story, there might easily be a"
9750,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,discrepancy between two versions[456].
9751,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,
9752,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,But the whole difficulty merely arises from reading more into the words of
9753,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,the _Episode_ than the text will warrant. It is not asserted in the
9754,SECTION IV. BUGGE'S THEORY,"_Episode_ that Hildeburh found her kinsfolk dead in the morning, but that"

9824,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,
9825,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,We have seen above[461] that according to a Scandinavian tradition Lotherus
9826,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"was exiled _in Jutiam_: and Heremod, who has been held to be the"
9827,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,counterpart of Lotherus

9834,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,
9835,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"(3) Finn comes into many Old English pedigrees, which have doubtless"

9838,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"of Kent[462]. Here, too, the name Hengest meets us."
9839,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,
9840,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"The view that the name ""Eoten"" in the _Finnsburg_ story is a form of the"

9842,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"which has in the past been held by many scholars and is, I think, held by"
9843,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,all who have recently expressed any opinion on the subject[463]. But this
9844,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,renders very difficult the assumption of Bugge and his followers that the
9845,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"word ""Eoten"" is synonymous with ""Frisian[464]."" For Frisians were not"
9846,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,Jutes. {263} The tribes were closely related; but the two words were not
9847,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"synonymous. The very lines in _Widsith_, which couple Jutes and Frisians"
9848,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"together, as if they were related in story, show that the names were"
9849,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,regarded as those of distinct tribes. And this evidence from _Widsith_ is
9850,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"very important, because the compiler of that list of names clearly knew the"
9851,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,story of Finn and Hnæf.
9852,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,
9853,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,But this is not the only difficulty in Bugge's interpretation of the Eotens
9854,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"as Frisians. The outbreak of war, we are told, is due to the treachery of"
9855,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,the Eotens. This Bugge and his followers interpret as meaning that Finn
9856,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"must have treacherously attacked Hnæf. Yet the poet speaks of ""the warriors"
9857,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"of Finn when the sudden danger fell upon them"": _þ[=a] h[=i][=e] se f[=æ]r"
9858,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,begeat_. It is essential to _f[=æ]r_ that it signifies a sudden and
9859,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"unexpected attack[465]: and the unexpected attack must have come, not upon"
9860,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,the assailants but upon the assailed.
9861,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,
9862,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"Yet this difficulty, though it has been emphasized by Möller[466] and other"
9863,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"opponents of Bugge's view, is not insuperable[467], and I hope to show"
9864,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,below that there is no real difficulty. But it leads us to a problem not so
9865,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"easily surmounted. If Finn made a treacherous attack upon Hnæf, and slew"
9866,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"him, how did it come that Hengest, and Hnæf's other men, made terms with"
9867,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,their murderous host?
9868,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,
9869,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,In the primitive heathen days it had been a rule that the retainer must not
9870,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,survive his vanquished lord[468]. The ferocity of this rule was
9871,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"subsequently softened, and, in point of fact, we _do_ often hear, after"
9872,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"some great leader has been slain, of his followers accepting quarter from a"

9874,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"disgracefully[469]. But, if Finn had invited Hnæf and Hnæf's retainers to"
9875,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"be his guests, and had fallen upon them by treachery, the action of the"
9876,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"retainers in coming to terms with Finn, in entering his service, and"
9877,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"stipulating how much of his pay they shall receive, would be contrary to"
9878,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"all standards of conduct as understood in the Heroic Age, and would deprive"
9879,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,Hnæf's men of any sympathy the audience might feel for them. But Hnæf's men
9880,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,are not censured: they are in fact treated most sympathetically in the
9881,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"_Episode_, and in the _Fragment_, at an earlier point in the story, they"
9882,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,are enthusiastically applauded[470].
9883,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,
9884,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,It is strange enough in any case that Hnæf's retainers should make terms
9885,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"with the slayer of their lord. But it is not merely strange, it is"
9886,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"absolutely unintelligible, if we are to suppose that Finn has not merely"
9887,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"slain Hnæf, but has lured him into his power, and then slain him while a"
9888,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,guest.
9889,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,
9890,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,It is to the credit of Bugge that he felt this difficulty: but his attempt
9891,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,to explain it is hardly satisfactory. He fell back upon a parallel between
9892,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,the story of the death of Rolf Kraki and the story of _Finnsburg_. We have
9893,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"already seen that the resemblance is very close between the _Bjarkamál_,"
9894,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"which narrates the death of Rolf, and the opening of the _Finnsburg"
9895,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,Fragment_. The parallel which Bugge invoked comes from the sequel to the
9896,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"Rolf story[471] which tells how Hiarwarus, the murderer of Rolf Kraki,"
9897,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"astonished by the devotion of Rolf's retainers, lamented their death, and"
9898,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"said how gladly he would have given quarter to such men, and taken them"
9899,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"into his service. Thereupon Wiggo, the one survivor, who had previously"
9900,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"vowed to avenge his lord, and had concealed himself with that object, came"
9901,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,forward and offered to accept these terms. Accordingly he placed his hand
9902,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"upon the hilt of his new master's drawn sword, as if about to swear fealty"
9903,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"to him: but instead of swearing, he ran him through."
9904,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,
9905,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"""Glorious and ever memorable hero, who valiantly kept his vow,"" says"
9906,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,Saxo[472]. Whether or no we share the exultation of {265} that excellent if
9907,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"somewhat bloodthirsty ecclesiastic, we must admit that Wiggo's methods were"
9908,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"sensible and practical. If, singlehanded, he was to keep his vow, and"
9909,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"avenge his lord, he could only hope to do it by some such stratagem."
9910,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,
9911,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"Bugge tries to explain Hengest's action on similar lines: ""He does not"
9912,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,hesitate to enter the service of Finn in order thereby to carry out his
9913,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"revenge[473]."""
9914,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,
9915,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"But the circumstances are entirely different. Wiggo was left alone, the"
9916,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"only survivor of Rolf's household, to face a whole army. But Hengest is no"
9917,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,single survivor: he and his fellows have made so good a defence that Finn
9918,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"cannot overcome them by conflict on the _meðel-stede_. Not only so, but, if"
9919,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,we accept the interpretation that almost every critic and editor has put
9920,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"upon the passage (ll. 1184-5), Hengest's position is even stronger. Finn"
9921,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,has lost almost all his thegns; the usual interpretation puts him at the
9922,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"mercy of Hengest: at best it is a draw[474]. If, then, Hengest wants"
9923,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"vengeance upon Finn, why does he not pursue it? Instead of which, according"
9924,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"to Bugge, he enters Finn's service in order that he may get an opportunity"
9925,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,for revenge.
9926,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,
9927,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"And note, that Wiggo did not swear the oath of fealty to the murderer of"
9928,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"his master Rolf: he merely put himself in the posture to do so, and then,"
9929,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"instead, ran the tyrant through forthwith. But Hengest _does_ swear the"
9930,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"oath, and _does not_ forthwith slay the tyrant. He spends the winter with"
9931,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"him, receives a sword from Hunlafing, after which his name does not occur"
9932,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"again. Finn is ultimately slain, but the names which are found in that"

9934,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,
9935,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,So Bugge's explanation comes to this: Hengest is fighting with success
9936,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"against Finn, but he refrains from vengeance: instead, he treacherously"
9937,SECTION V. SOME DIFFICULTIES IN BUGGE'S THEORY,"enters his service in order that he may take an opportunity of vengeance,"

10046,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"Many of the difficulties disappear: but the two big ones remain. Firstly,"
10047,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"if ""Eoten"" means ""Jute,"" as it is usually agreed that it does, why should"
10048,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"the Frisians be called Jutes, seeing that a Frisian is not a Jute?"
10049,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"Secondly, when Hengest and the other thegns of Hnæf enter the service of"

10051,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"excused, _þ[=a] him sw[=a] geþearfod wæs_. Such a situation is unusual; but"
10052,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"it becomes incredible if that slayer, whose service they enter, had fallen"
10053,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"upon and slain their lord by treachery, when his guest."
10054,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,
10055,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,It seems to me that neither of these difficulties is really inherent in the
10056,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"situation, but rather accidental, and owing to the way Bugge's theory,"
10057,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"right enough in its main lines, has been presented both by Bugge and his"
10058,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,followers. For it is not necessary to assume that Frisians _are_ called
10059,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,_Eotenas_ or Jutes. All that we are justified in deducing from the text is
10060,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,that Frisians and _Eotenas_ are both under the command of Finn. If we
10061,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"suppose what the text demands, _and no more_, we are at one stroke relieved"
10062,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"of both our difficulties. Though ""Jute"" can hardly have been synonymous"
10063,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"with ""Frisian,"" nothing is more probable, as I shall try to show[478], than"
10064,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"that a great Frisian king should have had a tribe of Jutes subject to him,"
10065,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,or should have had in his pay a band of Jutish mercenaries. Now if the
10066,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"trouble was due to these ""Eotens""--and we are told that it was[479]--our"
10067,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,second difficulty is also solved. It would be much more natural for Hengest
10068,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"to come to terms with Finn, albeit the _bana_ of his lord, if Finn's"
10069,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"conduct had not been stained by treachery, and if the blame for the"
10070,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,original attack did not rest with him.
10071,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,
10072,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"And, as I have said, there is nothing in the text which justifies us in"
10073,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"assuming that _Eotenas_ means ""Frisians"" and that therefore _Eotena"
10074,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,tr[=e]owe_ refers to Finn's breach of faith. It has indeed been argued that
10075,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"_Eotenas_ and Frisians are synonymous, {269} because in the terms of peace,"
10076,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,whilst it is stipulated that Hengest and his comrades are to have equal
10077,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"control with the _Eotena bearn_, it is further stipulated that Finn is to"
10078,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,give Hengest's men gifts equal to those which he gives to the _Fr[=e]sena
10079,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,cynn_[480]. Here then _Eotena bearn_ and _Fr[=e]sena cynn_ are certainly
10080,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"parallel, and are both contrasted with Hengest and his troops. But surely"
10081,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,this in no wise proves _Eotena bearn_ and _Fr[=e]sena cynn_ synonymous:
10082,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"they may equally well be different sections of Finn's host, just as in"
10083,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"_Brunanburh_ the soldiers of Athelstan are spoken of first as _Westseaxe_,"
10084,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,and then as _Myrce_. Are we to argue that West-Saxons are Mercians? So in
10085,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,the account of Hygelac's fatal expedition[481] the opponents are called
10086,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"Franks, Frisians, _H[=u]gas_, _Hetware_. A reader ignorant of the story"
10087,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,might suppose these all synonymous terms for one tribe. But we know that
10088,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,they are not: the _Hetware_ were the people immediately attacked--the
10089,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"Frankish overlord hastened to the rescue, and was apparently helped by the"
10090,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"neighbouring Frisians, who although frequently at this date opposed to the"
10091,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"Franks, would naturally make common cause against the pirate from"
10092,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,overseas[482].
10093,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,
10094,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"It was quite natural that the earlier students of the _Finnsburg Episode_,"
10095,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"thinking of the two opposing forces as two homogeneous tribes, and finding"
10096,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"mention of three tribal names, Danes, Eotens and Frisians, should have"
10097,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,assumed that the Eotens must be exactly synonymous with _either_ Danes _or_
10098,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,Frisians. But it is now recognized that the conditions of the time
10099,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,postulate not so much tribes as groups of tribes[483]. In the _Fragment_ we
10100,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"have, on the side of the Danes, _Sigeferth_, prince of the _Secgan_. The"
10101,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"_Secgan_ are not necessarily Danes, because their lord is fighting on the"
10102,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"Danish side. Neither need the _Eotenas_ be Frisians, because they are"
10103,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,fighting on the Frisian side.
10104,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,
10105,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"We cannot, then, argue that two tribes are identical, because engaged in"
10106,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"fighting a common foe: still less, because they are {270} mentioned with a"
10107,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"certain parallelism[484]. And anyway, it is impossible to find in the use"
10108,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,of the expression _Eotena bearn_ in l. 1088 any support for the
10109,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,interpretation which makes _Eotena tr[=e]owe_ signify the treachery of Finn
10110,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"himself. For, assuredly, the proviso that Hengest and his fellows are to"
10111,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,have half control as against the _Eotena bearn_ does not mean that they are
10112,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,to have half control as against Finn himself. For the very next lines make
10113,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,it clear that they are to enter Finn's service and become his retainers.
10114,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,That Hengest and his men are to have equal rights with Finn's Jutish
10115,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,followers (_Eotena bearn_) is reasonable enough: but they obviously have
10116,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"not equal rights with Finn, their lord whom they are now to follow. _Eotena"
10117,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"bearn_ in l. 1088, then, does _not_ include Finn: how _can_ it then be used"
10118,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,as an argument that _Eotena tr[=e]owe_ must refer to _Finn's_ faith and his
10119,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,breach of it?
10120,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,
10121,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"Finn, then, is the _bana_ of Hnæf, but there is nothing in the text which"
10122,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,compels us to assume that he is the slayer of his guest.
10123,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,
10124,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,The reader may regard my zeal to clear the character of Finn as excessive.
10125,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,But it is always worth while to understand a good old tale. And it is only
10126,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,when we withdraw our unjust aspersions upon Finn's good faith that the tale

10131,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,
10132,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"The poet tells us that Finn was the _bana_ of Hnæf, so, says Ayres, ""it is"
10133,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"hard to see how it helps matters[485]"" to argue that Finn was not guilty of"
10134,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,treachery. And Lawrence argues in the same way:
10135,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,
10136,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"""How is it possible to shift the blame for the attack from Finn to the"
10137,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,Eotenas when Finn is called the _bana_ of Hnæf? It does not matter
10138,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,whether he killed him with his own hands or not; he is clearly held
10139,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,responsible; the lines tell us it was regarded as disgraceful for the
10140,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"{271} Danes to have to follow him, and the revenge at the end falls"
10141,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,heavily upon him. The insult and hurt to Danish pride would be very
10142,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,little lessened by the assumption that someone else started the
10143,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"quarrel; and for this assumption, too, the lines give no warrant[486]."""
10144,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,
10145,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,Let us take these objections in turn. I do not see how the fact that Finn
10146,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"is called the _bana_ of Hnæf can prove _anything_ as to ""the blame for the"
10147,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"attack."" Of course the older editors may have thought so. Kemble translates"
10148,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"_bana_ ""slaughterer,"" which implies brutality, and perhaps culpability."
10149,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"Bosworth-Toller renders _bana_ ""murderer,"" which certainly implies blame"
10150,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,for attack. But we know that these are mere mistranslations. Nothing as to
10151,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"""blame for attack"" is implied in the term _bana_: ""_bana_ 'slayer' is a"
10152,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"perfectly neutral word, and must not be translated by 'murderer,' or any"
10153,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"word connoting criminality. A man who slays another in self-defence, or in"

10155,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,this to be true: and yet at the same time _bana_ is quoted to prove that
10156,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"Finn is to blame; because, for want of a better word, we half-consciously"
10157,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"render _bana_ ""murderer"": and ""murderer"" _does_ imply blame. ""Words,"" says"

10161,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"Lawrence continues: ""The lines tell us that it was regarded as disgraceful"
10162,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"for the Danes to have to follow him."" But surely this is saying too much."
10163,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,That the Frisians are not to taunt the Danes with following the slayer of
10164,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,their lord is only one of two possible interpretations of the ll. 1101-3.
10165,SECTION VII. PROBLEMS STILL OUTSTANDING,"And even if we accept this interpretation, it does not follow that the"

10215,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"authority for the hypothesis that Frisians occupied Jutish territory, we"
10216,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"find it to be this: that because in _Beowulf_ ""Jute"" means ""Frisian,"" some"
10217,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,such event must have taken place to account for this nomenclature[489]. So
10218,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"it comes to this: the Frisians must have been called Jutes, because they"
10219,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,occupied {273} Jutish territory: the Frisians must have occupied Jutish
10220,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,territory because they are called Jutes. I do not think we could have a
10221,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"better example of what Prof. Tupper calls ""philological legend."""
10222,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,
10223,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"Siebs rejects Bede's statement, which places the Jutes in what is now"
10224,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,Jutland: he believes them to have been immediately adjacent to the
10225,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,Frisians. For this belief that the Jutes were immediate neighbours of the
10226,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"Frisians there is, of course, some support, though not of a very convincing"
10227,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,kind: but the belief that the Frisians occupied the territory of these
10228,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"adjacent Jutes rests, so far as I know, solely upon this identification of"
10229,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"the _Eotenas_-Jutes with the Frisians, which it is then in turn used to"
10230,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,prove.
10231,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,
10232,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,But if by Jutes we understand (following Bede) a people dwelling north of
10233,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"the Angles, in or near the peninsula of Jutland, then it is of course true"
10234,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,that (at a much later date) a colony of Frisians _did_ occupy territory
10235,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"which is near Jutland, and which is sometimes included in the name"
10236,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"""Jutland."" But, as I have tried to show above, this ""North Frisian"" colony"
10237,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,belongs to a period much later than that of the Finn-story: we have no
10238,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,reason whatever to suppose that the Frisians of the Finn story are the
10239,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,North Frisians of Sylt and the adjoining islands and mainland--the
10240,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,_Frisiones qui habitabant Juthlandie_[490].
10241,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,
10242,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"And when we have assumed, without evidence, that, at the period with which"
10243,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"we are dealing, Frisians had occupied Jutish territory, we are then further"
10244,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"asked to assume that, from this settlement in Jutish territory, such"
10245,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,Frisians came to be called Jutes. Now this is an hypothesis _per se_
10246,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"conceivable, but very improbable. Throughout the whole Heroic Age, for a"
10247,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"thousand years after the time of Tacitus, Germanic tribes were moving, and"
10248,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"occupying the territory of other people. During this period, how many"
10249,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,instances can we find in which a tribe took the name of the people whose
10250,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"territory it occupied? Even where the name of the new home is adopted, the"
10251,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"old tribal name is _not_ adopted. For instance, the Bavarians occupied the"
10252,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"territory of the Celtic Boii, but they did not call themselves Boii, but"
10253,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"Bai(haim)varii, ""the dwellers in the land of the Boii""--a very {274}"
10254,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,different thing. In the same way the Jutes who settled in the land of the
10255,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"Cantii did not call themselves _Kente_, but _Cantware_, ""dwellers in"
10256,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"Cantium."" Of course, where the old name of a country survives, it does"
10257,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,often _in the long run_ come to be applied to its new inhabitants; but this
10258,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,takes many ages. It was not till a good thousand years after the English
10259,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"had conquered the land of the Britons, that Englishmen began to speak and"
10260,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"think of themselves as ""Britons."" In feudal or 18th century days all the"
10261,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"subjects of the ruler of Britain, Prussia, Austria, may come to be called"
10262,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"British, Prussians, Austrians. But this is no argument for the period with"
10263,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"which we are dealing. The assumption, then, that a body of Frisians, simply"
10264,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"because they inhabited land which had once been inhabited by Jutes, should"
10265,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"have called themselves Jutes, is so contrary to all we know of tribal"
10266,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"nomenclature at this date, that one could only accept it if compelled by"
10267,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,very definite evidence to do so. And of such evidence there is no
10268,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,scrap[491]. Neither is there a scrap of evidence for the underlying
10269,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,hypothesis that any Frisians _were_ settled at this date in Jutish
10270,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,territory.
10271,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,
10272,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"And as if this were not hypothetical enough, a further hypothesis has then"
10273,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"to be built upon it: viz., that this name ""Jutes,"" belonging to such of the"
10274,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"Frisians as had settled in Jutish territory, somehow became applicable to"
10275,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"Frisians as a whole. Now this might conceivably have happened, but only as"
10276,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,a result of certain political events. If the Jutish Frisians had become the
10277,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"governing element in Frisia, it would be conceivable. But after all, we"
10278,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"know something about Frisian history, and I do not {275} think we are at"
10279,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,liberty to assume any such changes as would have enabled the Frisian
10280,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"people, as a whole, to be called Jutes. How is it that we never get any"

10293,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"connected. The Signy of the _V[o,]lsunga Saga_ has been quoted as a"

10295,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,her brother Sigmund to wed King Siggeir. Siggeir invites the kin of his
10296,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"wife to visit him, and then slays Volsung and all his sons, save Sigmund."
10297,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"But it is the difference of the story, rather than its likeness, which is"
10298,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,striking. No hint is ever made of any possibility of reconciliation between
10299,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,Siggeir and the kin of the men he has slain. The feud admits of no
10300,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,"atonement, and is continued to the utterance. Siggeir's very wife helps her"
10301,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,brother Sigmund to his revenge.
10302,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,
10303,SECTION VIII. THE WEIGHT OF PROOF: THE EOTENS,How different from the attitude of Sigmund and Signy is the willingness of

10424,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,those who make it; but the questions which arise are precisely these: Who
10425,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,started the quarrel? Was the slaying fair or treacherous? Upon the answer
10426,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,depends the possibility of atonement. There may be some insult and hurt to
10427,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"a man's pride in accepting atonement, even in cases where the other side"

10431,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10432,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Prof. Lawrence has suggested that perhaps, in the original version of the"
10433,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"_Finnsburg_ story, the Danes were reduced to greater straits than is"
10434,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,represented to be the case in the extant _Beowulf Episode_. He thinks that
10435,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"it is ""almost incomprehensible"" that Hengest should make terms with Finn,"
10436,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,if he had really reduced Finn and his thegns to such a degree of
10437,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,helplessness as the words of the _Episode_ state. It seems to me that the
10438,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,matter depends much more upon the treachery or the honesty of Finn. If Finn
10439,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"was guilty of treachery and slaughter of his guests, then it _is_"
10440,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"""unintelligible"" that Hengest should spare him: but if Finn was really a"
10441,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"respectable character, then the fact that Hengest was making headway"
10442,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"against him is rather a reason why Hengest should be moderate, than"
10443,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,otherwise. To quote the _Laxdæla Saga_ again: though Olaf the Peacock lets
10444,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"off Bolli, the _bani_ of his son Kjartan, with a money payment, he makes it"
10445,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"clear that he is master of the situation, before he shows this mercy."
10446,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Paradoxical as it sounds, it was often easier for a man to show moderation"
10447,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"in pursuing a blood feud, just _because_ he was in a strong position. It is"
10448,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,so again in the _Saga of Thorstein the White_. But the adversary must be
10449,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,one who deserves to be treated with moderation.
10450,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10451,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Of course it is quite possible that Prof. Lawrence is right, and that in"
10452,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,some earlier and more correct version the Danes may have been represented
10453,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,as so outnumbered by the Frisians that they had no choice except to
10454,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"surrender to Finn, and enter his service, or else to be destroyed. But,"
10455,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"whether this be so or no, all parallel incidents in the old literature show"
10456,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,that their choice between these evil alternatives will depend upon whether
10457,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Finn, the _bana_ of their lord, slew that lord by deliberate and"
10458,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"premeditated treachery whilst he was his guest, or whether he {280} was"
10459,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"embroiled with him through the fault of others, under circumstances which"
10460,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"were perfectly honourable. If the latter is the case, then Hnæf's men"
10461,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,_might_ accept quarter. Their position is comparable with that of Illugi at
10462,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,the end of the _Grettis Saga_[502]. Illugi is a prisoner in the hands of
10463,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"the slayers of Grettir and he charges them with having overcome Grettir,"
10464,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"when already on the point of death from a mortifying wound, which they had"
10465,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,inflicted on him by sorcery and enchantment. The slayers propose to Illugi
10466,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"terms parallel to those made to the retainers of Hnæf. ""I will give thee"
10467,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"thy life,"" says their leader, ""if thou wilt swear to us an oath not to take"
10468,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"vengeance on any of those who have been in this business."""
10469,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10470,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Now, note the answer of Illugi: ""That might have seemed to me a matter to"
10471,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"be discussed, if Grettir had been able to defend himself, and if ye had"
10472,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,overcome him with valour and courage; but now it is not to be looked for
10473,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"that I will save my life by being such a coward as art thou. In a word, no"
10474,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"man shall be more harmful to thee than I, if I live, _for never can I"
10475,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"forget how it was that ye have vanquished Grettir_. Much rather, then, do I"
10476,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"choose to die."""
10477,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10478,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Now of course it would have been an ""insult and hurt"" to the pride of"
10479,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Illugi, or of any other decent eleventh century Icelander, to have been"
10480,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"compelled to swear an oath not to avenge his brother, even though that"
10481,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,brother had been slain in the most chivalrous way possible; and it would
10482,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"doubtless have been a hard matter, even in such a case, for Illugi to have"
10483,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"kept his oath, had he sworn it. But the treachery of the opponents puts an"
10484,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"oath out of the question, just as it must have done in the case of the"
10485,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"followers of King Cynewulf[503] or of Rolf Kraki, and as it must have done"
10486,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"in the case of the followers of Hnæf, had the slaying of Hnæf been a"
10487,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,premeditated act of treachery on the part of Finn.
10488,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10489,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"In the _Njáls Saga_, Flosi has to take up the feud for the slain Hauskuld."
10490,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Flosi is a moderate and reasonable man, so the first thing he does is to"
10491,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,enquire into the _circumstances_ under which Hauskuld was slain. Flosi
10492,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"finds that the circumstances, and the outrageous conduct of the slayers,"
10493,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,give him no choice {281} but to prosecute the feud. So in the end he burns
10494,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Njal's hall, and in it the child of Kari."
10495,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10496,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,Now to have burned a man's child to death might well seem a deed impossible
10497,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,of atonement. Yet in the end Flosi and Kari are reconciled by a full
10498,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"atonement, _the father of the slain child actually taking the first"
10499,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,step_[504]. And all this is possible because Flosi and Kari recognise that
10500,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"each has been trying to play his part with justice and fairness, and that"
10501,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,each is dragged into the feud through the fault of others. When Flosi has
10502,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"said of his enemy, ""I would that I were altogether such a man as Kari is,"""
10503,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,we feel that reconciliation is in sight.
10504,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10505,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,Very similar is the reconciliation between Alboin and Thurisind in
10506,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Longobard story, but with this difference, that here it is Alboin who seeks"
10507,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"reconciliation by going to the hall of the man whose son he has slain, thus"
10508,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,reversing the parts of Flosi and Kari; and reconciliation is possible--just
10509,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,barely possible.
10510,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10511,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Again, when Bothvar comes to the hall of Rolf, and slays one of Rolf's"
10512,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"retainers, the other retainers naturally claim full vengeance. Rolf insists"
10513,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,upon investigating the _circumstances_. When he learns that it was his own
10514,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"man who gave the provocation, he comes to terms with the slayer."
10515,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10516,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Of course it was a difficult matter, and one involving a sacrifice of their"
10517,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"pride, for the retainers of Hnæf to come to any composition with the _bana_"
10518,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"of their lord; but it is not unthinkable, if the quarrel was started by"
10519,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Finn's subordinates without his consent, and if Finn himself fought fair."
10520,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,But had the slaying been an act of premeditated treachery on the part of
10521,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Finn, the atonement would, I submit, have been not only difficult but"
10522,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,impossible. If the retainers of Hnæf had had such success as our poem
10523,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"implies, then their action under such circumstances is, as Lawrence says,"
10524,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"""almost incomprehensible."" If they did it under compulsion, and fear of"
10525,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"death, then their action would be contrary to all the ties of Germanic"
10526,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"honour, and would entirely deprive them of any sympathy the audience might"
10527,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,otherwise have felt for them. Yet it is quite obvious that the retainers of
10528,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,Hnæf are precisely the people with whom the audience is expected to
10529,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,sympathise[505].
10530,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10531,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,{282}
10532,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10533,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"In any case, the feud was likely enough to break out again as it did in the"
10534,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"case of Alboin and Thurisind, and equally in that of Hrothgar and Ingeld."
10535,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10536,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Indeed, the different versions of the story of the feud between the house"
10537,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,of Hrothgar and the house of Froda are very much to the point.
10538,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10539,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,Much the oldest version--probably in its main lines quite historical--is
10540,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,the story as given in _Beowulf_. Froda has been slain by the Danes in
10541,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"pitched battle. Subsequently Hrothgar, upon whom, as King of the Danes, the"
10542,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"responsibility for meeting the feud has devolved, tries to stave it off by"
10543,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"wedding his daughter Freawaru to Ingeld, son of Froda. The sympathy of the"
10544,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"poet is obviously with the luckless pair, Ingeld and Freawaru, involved as"
10545,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,they are in ancient hatreds which are not of their making. For it is
10546,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"foreseen how some old warrior, who cannot forget his loyalty to his former"
10547,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"king, will stir up the feud afresh."
10548,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10549,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,But Saxo Grammaticus tells the story differently. Froda (Frotho) is
10550,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"treacherously invited to a banquet, and then slain. By this treachery the"
10551,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,whole atmosphere of the story is changed. Ingeld (Ingellus) marries the
10552,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"daughter of his father's slayer, and, for this, the old version reproduced"
10553,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,by Saxo showers upon him literally scores of phrases of scorn and contempt.
10554,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,The whole interest of the story now centres not in the recreant Ingeld or
10555,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"his wife of treacherous race, but in the old warrior Starkad, whose spirit"
10556,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"and eloquence is such that he can bring Ingeld to a sense of his ""vast"
10557,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"sin[506],"" can burst the bonds of his iniquity, and at last compel him to"
10558,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,take vengeance for his father.
10559,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10560,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,In the _Saga of Rolf Kraki_ the story of Froda is still further changed. It
10561,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,is a tale not only of treachery but also of slaying of kin. Consequently
10562,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"the idea of any kind of atonement, however temporary, has become"
10563,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,impossible; there is no hint of it.
10564,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,
10565,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,Now the whole atmosphere of the Hengest-story in _Beowulf_ is parallel to
10566,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"that of the _Beowulf_ version of the Ingeld-story: agreement is possible,"
10567,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,though it does not prove to be permanent. There is room for much hesitation
10568,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,in the minds of Hengest and of Ingeld: they remain the heroes of the story.
10569,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"But if Finn had, as is usually supposed, invited Hnæf to his fort and then"
10570,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"{283} deliberately slain him by treachery, the whole atmosphere would have"
10571,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"been different. Hengest could not then be the hero, but the foil: the"
10572,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"example of a man whose spirit fails at the crisis, who does the utterly"
10573,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"disgraceful thing, and enters the service of his lord's treacherous foe."
10574,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,The hero of the story would be some other character--possibly the young
10575,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Hunlafing, who, loyal in spite of the treachery and cowardice of his leader"
10576,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"Hengest, yet, remaining steadfast of soul, is able in the end to infuse his"
10577,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,"own courage into the heart of the recreant Hengest, and to inspire all the"
10578,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,perjured Danish thegns to their final and triumphant revenge on Finn.
10579,SECTION IX. ETHICS OF THE BLOOD FEUD,

10586,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"The theory, then, which seems to fit in best with what we know of the"
10587,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"historic conditions at the time when the story arose, and which fits in"
10588,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"best with such details of the story as we have, is this:"
10589,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,
10590,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"Finn, King of Frisia, has a stronghold, Finnsburg, outside the limits of"
10591,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"Frisia proper. There several clans and chieftains are assembled[507]: Hnæf,"
10592,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"Finn's brother-in-law, prince of the Hocings, the Eotens, and Sigeferth,"
10593,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,prince of the Secgan; whether Sigeferth has his retinue with him or no is
10594,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,not clear.
10595,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,
10596,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,But the treachery of the Eotens causes trouble: they have some old feud
10597,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"with Hnæf and his Danes, and attack them by surprise in their hall. There"
10598,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,is no proof that Finn has any share in this treason. It is therefore quite
10599,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,natural that in the _Episode_--although the treachery of the Eotens is
10600,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"censured--Finn is never blamed; and that in the _Fragment_, Finn has"
10601,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"apparently no share in the attack on the hall, at any rate during those"
10602,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,first five days to which the account in the _Fragment_ is limited.
10603,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,
10604,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"The attack is led by Garulf (_Fragment_, l. 20), presumably the prince of"
10605,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,the Eotens: and some friend or kinsman is urging Garulf not to hazard so
10606,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"precious a life in the first attack. And {284} here, too, the situation now"
10607,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"becomes clearer: if Garulf is the chief of the attacking people, we can"
10608,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,understand one of his kinsmen or friends expostulating thus: but if he is
10609,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,merely one of a number of subordinates despatched by Finn to attack the
10610,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"hall, the position would not be so easily understood."
10611,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,
10612,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"Garulf, however, does not heed the warning, and falls, ""first of all the"
10613,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"dwellers in that land."" The _Fragment_ breaks off, but the fight goes on:"
10614,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,we can imagine that matters must have proceeded much as in the great attack
10615,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,upon the hall in the _Nibelungen lied_[508]. One man after another would be
10616,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"drawn in, by the duty of revenge, and Finn's own men would wake to find a"
10617,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"battle in progress. ""The sudden bale (_f[=æ]r_) came upon them."" Finn's son"
10618,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"joins in the attack, perhaps in order to avenge some young comrade in arms;"
10619,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"and is slain, possibly by Hnæf. Then Finn _has_ to intervene, and Hnæf in"
10620,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"turn is slain, possibly, though not certainly, by Finn himself. But"
10621,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"Hengest, the thegn of Hnæf, puts up so stout a defence, that Finn is unable"
10622,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,to take a full vengeance upon all the Danes. He offers them terms. What are
10623,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,Hengest and the thegns to do?
10624,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,
10625,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"Finn has slain their lord. But they are Finn's guests, and they have slain"
10626,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"Finn's son in his own house. Finn himself is, I take it, blameless. _It is"
10627,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"here that the tragic tension comes in._ We can understand how, even if"
10628,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"Hengest had Finn in his power, he might well have stayed his hand. So peace"
10629,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"is made, and all is to be forgotten: solemn oaths are sworn. And Finn keeps"
10630,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"his promise honestly. He resumes his position of host, making no"
10631,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"distinction between Eotens, Frisians and Danes, who are all, for the time"
10632,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"at least, his followers."
10633,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,
10634,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,I think we have here a rational explanation of the action of Hengest and
10635,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"the other thegns of Hnæf, in following the slayer of their lord."
10636,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,
10637,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,The situation resembles that which takes place when Alboin seeks
10638,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"hospitality in the hall of the man whose son he has slain, or when Ingeld"
10639,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"is reconciled to Hrothgar. Very similar, too, {285} is the temporary"
10640,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,reconciliation often brought about in an Icelandic feud by the feeling that
10641,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"the other side has something to say for itself, and that both have suffered"
10642,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,grievously. The death of Finn's son is a set off against the death of
10643,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"Hnæf[509]. But, as in the case of Alboin and of Ingeld, or of many an"
10644,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"Icelandic Saga, the passion for revenge is too deep to be laid to rest"
10645,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"permanently. This is what makes the figure of Hengest tragic, like the"
10646,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"figure of Ingeld: both have plighted their word, but neither can keep it."
10647,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,
10648,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"The assembly breaks up. Finn and his men go back to Friesland, and Hengest"
10649,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,accompanies them: of the other Danish survivors nothing is said for the
10650,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"moment: whatever longings they may have had for revenge, the poet"
10651,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,concentrates all for the moment in the figure of Hengest.
10652,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,
10653,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"Hengest spends the winter with Finn, but he cannot quiet his conscience:"
10654,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"and in the end, he accepts the gift of a sword from a young Danish prince"
10655,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"Hunlafing, who is planning revenge. The uncles of Hunlafing, Guthlaf and"
10656,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"Oslaf [Ordlaf], had been in the hall when it was attacked, and had"
10657,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"survived. It is possible that the young prince's father, Hunlaf, was slain"
10658,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"then, and that his son is therefore recognised as having the nominal"
10659,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"leadership in the operations of vengeance[510]. Hengest, by accepting the"
10660,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"sword, promises his services in the work of revenge, and makes a great"
10661,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,slaughter of the treacherous Eotens. Perhaps he so far respects his oath
10662,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,that he leaves the simultaneous attack upon Finn to Guthlaf and Oslaf
10663,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"[Ordlaf]. Here we should have an explanation of _swylce_: ""in like"
10664,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"wise[511]""; and also an explanation of the omission of Hengest's name from"
10665,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,"the final act, the slaying of Finn himself. Hengest made the Eotens {286}"
10666,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,feel the sharpness of his sword: and in like wise Guthlaf and Oslaf
10667,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,conducted their part of the campaign. Of course this is only a guess: but
10668,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,it is very much in the manner of the Heroic Age to get out of a difficulty
10669,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,by respecting the letter of an oath whilst breaking its spirit--just as
10670,SECTION X. AN ATTEMPT AT RECONSTRUCTION,Hogni and Gunnar arrange that the actual slaying of Sigurd shall be done by

10747,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,
10748,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"It is now generally recognised that loose confederacies of tribes were, at"
10749,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"the period with which we are dealing, very common. Lawrence says this"
10750,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"expressly: ""The actors in this drama are members of two North Sea tribes,"
10751,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"or _rather groups of tribes_[513]""; and again[514]: ""At the time when the"
10752,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"present poem was put into shape, we surely have to assume for the Danes and"
10753,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"Frisians, not compact and unified political units, but groups of tribes"
10754,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"held somewhat loosely together, and sometimes known by tribal names."""
10755,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,
10756,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,This seems to me a quite accurate view of the political situation in the
10757,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"later Heroic Age. The independent tribes, as they existed at the time of"
10758,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"Tacitus, tended to coalesce, and from such coalition the nations of modern"
10759,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,Europe are gradually evolved. In the seventh and eighth centuries a great
10760,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"king of Northumbria or Frisia is likely to be king, not of one only, but of"
10761,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,many allied tribes. I cannot therefore quite understand why some scholars
10762,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,reject so immediately the idea that the Eotens are not necessarily
10763,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"Frisians, but rather a tribe in alliance with the Frisians. For if, as they"
10764,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"admit, we are dealing not with two compact units, but with two groups of"
10765,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"tribes, why must we assume, as earlier scholars have done, that _Eotenas_"
10766,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,must be synonymous either with Frisians or Danes? That assumption is based
10767,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,upon the belief that we _are_ dealing with two compact units. It has no
10768,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,other foundation. I can quite understand Kemble and Ettmüller jumping at
10769,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,the conclusion that the Eotens _must_ be identical with the one side or the
10770,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"other. But once we have recognised that confederacies of tribes, rather"
10771,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"than individual tribes, are to be expected in the period with which we are"
10772,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"dealing, then surely no such assumption should be made."
10773,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,
10774,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,I think we shall be helped if we try to get some clear idea of the
10775,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,nationalities concerned in the struggle. For to judge by the analogy of
10776,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"other contemporary Germanic stories, there probably is some historic basis"
10777,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"for the _Finnsburg_ story: and even if the fight is purely fictitious, and"
10778,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"if Finn Folcwalding never existed, still the Old English poets would"
10779,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,represent the fictitious Frisian king in the light of what they knew of
10780,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,contemporary kings.
10781,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,
10782,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"Now the Frisians were no insignificant tribe. They were a power,"
10783,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"controlling the coasts of what was then called the ""Frisian Sea[515]."""
10784,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,Commerce was in Frisian hands. Archaeological evidence points to a lively
10785,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,trade between the Frisian districts and the coast of Norway[516]. From
10786,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"about the sixth century, when ""Dorostates of the Frisians"" is mentioned by"
10787,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,the Geographer of Ravenna (or the source from which he drew) in a manner
10788,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,which shows it to have been known even in Italy as a place of peculiar
10789,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"{289} importance[517], to the ninth century, when it was destroyed by"
10790,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"repeated attacks of the Vikings, the Frisian port of Dorestad[518] was one"
10791,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,of the greatest trade centres of Northern Europe[519]. By the year 700 the
10792,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,Frisian power had suffered severely from the constant blows dealt to it by
10793,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,the Frankish Mayors of the Palace. Yet evidence seems to show that even at
10794,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,that date the Frisian king ruled all the coast which intervened between the
10795,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,borders of the Franks on the one side and of the Danes on the other[520].
10796,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,When a zealous missionary demonstrated the powerlessness of the heathen
10797,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"gods by baptizing three converts in the sacred spring of Fosetisland, he"
10798,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,was carried before the King of Frisia for judgement[521].
10799,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,
10800,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"At a later date the ""Danes"" became the controlling power in the North Sea;"
10801,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"but in the centuries before the Viking raids began, the Frisians appear to"
10802,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,have had it all their own way.
10803,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,
10804,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"Finn, son of Folcwald, found his way into some English genealogies[522]"
10805,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,just as the Roman Emperor did into others. This also seems to point to the
10806,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,Frisian power having made an impression on the nations around.
10807,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,
10808,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,We should expect all this to be reflected in the story of the great Frisian
10809,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,king. How then would a seventh or eighth century Englishman regard Finn and
10810,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"his father Folcwalda? Probably as paramount chiefs, holding authority over"
10811,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"the tribes of the South and East coast of the North Sea, similar to that"
10812,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"which, for example, a Northumbrian king held over the tribes settled along"
10813,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"the British coast. Indeed, the whole story of the Northumbrian kings, as"
10814,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"given in Bede, deserves comparison: the relation with the subordinate"
10815,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"tribes, the alliances, the feuds, the attempted assassinations, the loyalty"
10816,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,of the thegns--this is the atmosphere amid which the Finn story grew up in
10817,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"England, and if we want to understand the story we must begin by getting"
10818,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,this point of view.
10819,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,
10820,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"But, if this be a correct estimate of tribal conditions at the time the"
10821,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"_Finnsburg_ story took form, we no longer need far-fetched explanations to"
10822,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,account for Finnsburg not being in Friesland. It is natural that it should
10823,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,"not be, just as natural as that the contemporary Eadwinesburg should be"
10824,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,outside the ancient limits of Deira. Nor do we need any far-fetched
10825,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,explanations why the Frisians should be called _Eotenas_. That the King of
10826,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,Frisia should have had Jutes under his rule is likely enough. And this is
10827,FRISIA IN THE HEROIC AGE,all that the words of the _Episode_ demand.

11358,B. GRENDEL,A.D. 972. Extract from an account of the descent of lands belonging to
11359,B. GRENDEL,"Westminster, quoting a grant of King Edgar[578]."

11363,B. GRENDEL,
11364,B. GRENDEL,"The property described is near Watling Street, between Edgware, Hendon, and"
11365,B. GRENDEL,the River Brent. It is a low-lying {307} district almost surrounded by the
11366,B. GRENDEL,"hills of Hampstead, Highgate, Barnet, Mill Hill, Elstree, Bushey Heath and"
11367,B. GRENDEL,Harrow. The bottom of the basin thus formed must have been a swamp[579].
11368,B. GRENDEL,"What the ""gate"" may have been it is difficult to say. A foreign scholar has"
11369,B. GRENDEL,suggested that it may have been a narrow mountain defile or possibly a
11370,B. GRENDEL,cave[580]: but this suggestion could never have been made by anyone who
11371,B. GRENDEL,"knew the country. The ""gate"" is likely to have been a channel connecting"
11372,B. GRENDEL,two meres--or it might have been a narrow piece of land between them--one
11373,B. GRENDEL,of those _enge [=a]npaðas_ which Grendel and his mother had to tread.
11374,B. GRENDEL,"Anyway, there is nothing exceptional in this use of ""gate"" in connection"
11375,B. GRENDEL,"with a water-spirit. Necker, on the Continent, also had his ""gates."" Thus"
11376,B. GRENDEL,"there is a ""Neckersgate Mill"" near Brussels, and the name ""Neckersgate"""
11377,B. GRENDEL,"used also to be applied to a group of houses near by, surrounded by"
11378,B. GRENDEL,water[581].
11379,B. GRENDEL,
11380,B. GRENDEL,"All the other places clearly point to a water-spirit: two meres, two pits,"
11381,B. GRENDEL,a mire and a beck: for the most part situated in low-lying country which
11382,B. GRENDEL,must in Anglo-Saxon times have been swampy. All this harmonizes excellently
11383,B. GRENDEL,with the _fenfreoðo_ of _Beowulf_ (l. 851). Of course it does not in the
11384,B. GRENDEL,least follow that these places were named after the Grendel of our poem. It
11385,B. GRENDEL,may well be that there was in England a current belief in a creature
11386,B. GRENDEL,"Grendel, dwelling among the swamps. Von Sydow has compared the Yorkshire"
11387,B. GRENDEL,"belief in Peg Powler, or the Lancashire Jenny Greenteeth. But these aquatic"
11388,B. GRENDEL,"monsters are not exactly parallel; for they abide in the water, and are"
11389,B. GRENDEL,"dangerous only to those who attempt to cross it, or at any rate venture too"
11390,B. GRENDEL,"near the bank[582], whilst Grendel and even his mother are capable of"
11391,B. GRENDEL,excursions of some distance from their fastness amid the fens.
11392,B. GRENDEL,
11393,B. GRENDEL,{308}
11394,B. GRENDEL,
11395,B. GRENDEL,Of course the mere-haunting Grendel _may_ have been identified only at a
11396,B. GRENDEL,comparatively late date with the spirit who struggles with the hero in the
11397,B. GRENDEL,"house, and flees below the earth in the folk-tale."
11398,B. GRENDEL,
11399,B. GRENDEL,"At any rate belief in a Grendel, haunting mere and fen, is clearly"
11400,B. GRENDEL,demonstrable for England--at any rate for the south and west of England:
11401,B. GRENDEL,"for of these place-names two belong to the London district, one to"
11402,B. GRENDEL,"Wiltshire, one to Devonshire, two to Worcester and one to Stafford. The"
11403,B. GRENDEL,place-name _Grendele_ in Yorkshire is too doubtful to be of much help.
11404,B. GRENDEL,"(_Domesday Book_, I, 302.) It is the modern village Grindale, four miles"
11405,B. GRENDEL,"N.W. of Bridlington. From it, probably, is derived the surname _Grindle,"
11406,B. GRENDEL,Grindall_ (Bardsley).
11407,B. GRENDEL,
11408,B. GRENDEL,
11409,B. GRENDEL,
11410,B. GRENDEL,"Abroad, the nearest parallel is to be found in Transsylvania, where there"
11411,B. GRENDEL,"is a _Grändels môr_ among the Saxons of the Senndorf district, near"
11412,B. GRENDEL,Bistritz. The Saxons of Transsylvania are supposed to have emigrated from
11413,B. GRENDEL,"the neighbourhood of the lower Rhine and the Moselle, and there is a"
11414,B. GRENDEL,_Grindelbach_ in Luxemburg which may possibly be connected with the marsh
11415,B. GRENDEL,demon[583].
11416,B. GRENDEL,
11417,B. GRENDEL,Most of the German names in _Grindel-_ or _Grendel-_ are connected with
11418,B. GRENDEL,"_grendel_, ""a bar,"" and therefore do not come into consideration here[584]:"
11419,B. GRENDEL,"but the Transsylvanian ""Grendel's marsh[585],"" anyway, reminds us of the"
11420,B. GRENDEL,"English ""Grendel's marsh"" or ""mere"" or ""pit."" Nevertheless, the local story"
11421,B. GRENDEL,with which the Transsylvanian swamp is connected--that of a peasant who was
11422,B. GRENDEL,ploughing with six oxen and was swallowed up in the earth--is such that it
11423,B. GRENDEL,requires considerable ingenuity to see any connection between it and the
11424,B. GRENDEL,_Beowulf-Grendel_-tale[586].
11425,B. GRENDEL,
11426,B. GRENDEL,{309}
11427,B. GRENDEL,
11428,B. GRENDEL,The Anglo-Saxon place-names may throw some light upon the meaning and
11429,B. GRENDEL,"etymology of ""Grendel[587]."" The name has generally been derived from"
11430,B. GRENDEL,"_grindan_, ""to grind""; either directly[588], because Grendel grinds the"
11431,B. GRENDEL,"bones of those he devours, or indirectly, in the sense of ""tormentor[589]."""
11432,B. GRENDEL,"Others would connect with O.N. _grindill_, ""storm,"" and perhaps with M.E."
11433,B. GRENDEL,"_gryndel_, ""angry[590]."""
11434,B. GRENDEL,
11435,B. GRENDEL,"It has recently been proposed to connect the word with _grund_, ""bottom"":"
11436,B. GRENDEL,for Grendel lives in the _mere-grund_ or _grund-wong_ and his mother is the
11437,B. GRENDEL,"_grund-wyrgin_. Erik Rooth, who proposes this etymology, compares the"
11438,B. GRENDEL,"Icelandic _grandi_, ""a sandbank,"" and the common Low German dialect word"
11439,B. GRENDEL,"_grand_, ""coarse sand[591]."" This brings us back to the root ""to grind,"""
11440,B. GRENDEL,"for _grand_, ""sand"" is simply the product of the grinding of the"
11441,B. GRENDEL,waves[592]. Indeed the same explanation has been given of the word
11442,B. GRENDEL,"""ground[593]."""
11443,B. GRENDEL,
11444,B. GRENDEL,"However this may be, the new etymology differs from the old in giving"
11445,B. GRENDEL,"Grendel a name derived, not from his grinding or tormenting others, but"
11446,B. GRENDEL,from his dwelling at the bottom of the lake or marsh[594]. The name would
11447,B. GRENDEL,"have a parallel in the Modern English _grindle_, _grundel_, German"
11448,B. GRENDEL,"_grundel_[595], a fish haunting the bottom of the water."
11449,B. GRENDEL,
11450,B. GRENDEL,"The Old English place-names, associating Grendel as they do with meres and"
11451,B. GRENDEL,"swamps, seem rather to support this."
11452,B. GRENDEL,
11453,B. GRENDEL,"As to the Devonshire stream _Grendel_ (now the Grindle or Greendale Brook),"
11454,B. GRENDEL,it has been suggested that this name is also {310} connected with the root
11455,B. GRENDEL,"_grand_, ""gravel,"" ""sand."" But, so far as I have been able to observe,"
11456,B. GRENDEL,there is no particular suggestion of sand or gravel about this modest
11457,B. GRENDEL,little brook. If we follow the River Clyst from the point where the Grindle
11458,B. GRENDEL,"flows into it, through two miles of marshy land, to the estuary of the Exe,"
11459,B. GRENDEL,we shall there find plenty. But it is clear from the charter of 963 that
11460,B. GRENDEL,"the name was then, as now, restricted to the small brook. I cannot tell why"
11461,B. GRENDEL,"the stream should bear the name, or what, if any, is the connection with"
11462,B. GRENDEL,the monster Grendel. We can only note that the name is again found attached
11463,B. GRENDEL,"to water, and, near the junction with the Clyst, to marshy ground."
11464,B. GRENDEL,
11465,B. GRENDEL,"Anyone who will hunt Grendel through the shires, first on the 6-in."
11466,B. GRENDEL,"ordnance map, and later on foot, will probably have to agree with the Three"
11467,B. GRENDEL,Jovial Huntsmen
11468,B. GRENDEL,
11469,B. GRENDEL,"This huntin' doesn't pay,"
11470,B. GRENDEL,"But we'n powler't up an' down a bit, an' had a rattlin' day."
11471,B. GRENDEL,
11472,B. GRENDEL,"But, if some conclusions, although scanty, can be drawn from place-names in"
11473,B. GRENDEL,"which the word _grendel_ occurs, nothing can be got from the numerous"
11474,B. GRENDEL,place-names which have been thought to contain the name _B[=e]ow_. The
11475,B. GRENDEL,"clearest of these is the _on B[=e]owan hammes hecgan_, which occurs in the"
11476,B. GRENDEL,Wiltshire charter of 931. But we can learn nothing definite from it: and
11477,B. GRENDEL,"although there are other instances of strong and weak forms alternating, we"
11478,B. GRENDEL,cannot even be quite certain that the Beowa here is identical with the Beow
11479,B. GRENDEL,of the genealogies[596].
11480,B. GRENDEL,
11481,B. GRENDEL,"The other cases, many of which occur in _Domesday Book_ are worthless."
11482,B. GRENDEL,Those which point to a weak form may often be derived from the weak noun
11483,B. GRENDEL,"_b[=e]o_, ""bee"": ""The Anglo-Saxons set great store by their bees, honey and"
11484,B. GRENDEL,"wax being indispensables to them[597]."""
11485,B. GRENDEL,
11486,B. GRENDEL,"_B[=e]as br[=o]c_, _B[=e]as feld_ (_Bewes feld_) occur in charters: but"
11487,B. GRENDEL,"here a connection with _b[=e]aw_, ""horsefly,"" is possible: for parallels,"
11488,B. GRENDEL,"one has only to consider the long list of places enumerated by Björkman,"
11489,B. GRENDEL,"the names of which are derived from those of beasts, {311} birds, or"
11490,B. GRENDEL,"insects[598]. And in such a word as _B[=e]ol[=e]ah_, even if the first"
11491,B. GRENDEL,"element be _b[=e]ow_, why may it not be the common noun ""barley,"" and not"
11492,B. GRENDEL,the name of the hero at all?
11493,B. GRENDEL,
11494,B. GRENDEL,"No argument can therefore be drawn from such a conjecture as that of Olrik,"
11495,B. GRENDEL,that _B[=e]as br[=o]c_ refers to the water into which the last sheaf
11496,B. GRENDEL,"(representing Beow) was thrown, in accordance with the harvest custom, and"
11497,B. GRENDEL,in the expectation of the return of the spirit in the coming spring[599].

11713,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,Now the West-Saxon pedigree is found in many forms: some which trace the

11718,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,(1) The nucleus of the whole pedigree is to be found in the names between

11746,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,In both MSS the pedigree is brought down to King Ine (688-726): both MSS

11788,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"all the ancestors of Scef, thus severing relations with Noah and Adam, and"
11789,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,that he would have attributed to Scef the story which in _Beowulf_ is
11790,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"attributed to Scyld, all this simply in order to bring his English pedigree"
11791,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,into some harmony with what is told about the Danish pedigree in

11793,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,

11796,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"from all we know of Ethelwerd, was most likely to have interested him: that"
11797,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"which connected his race with Noah and Adam. Further, it is to suppose him"
11798,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,to have reproduced just those stages in the pedigree which on critical

11803,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"come down to us to-day, namely _Beowulf_ and the _Chronicle_, he is, in"

11807,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"that Ethelwerd, who writes as the historian of the West-Saxon royal family,"
11808,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,should have known of a family pedigree which traced the line up to Sceaf
11809,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"and his arrival in the boat, and that he should have (rightly) thought this"
11810,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,to be more authoritative than the pedigree in the _Chronicle_ under the

11812,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"is here quite justified in holding that Ethelwerd had ""acquired the"
11813,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"genealogy from some unknown source, in a more primitive form than that"
11814,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"contained in the _Chronicle_[627]."""
11815,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,
11816,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"But, because the source of Ethelwerd's pedigree is more primitive than that"
11817,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"contained in the _Chronicle_ under the year 855, it does not follow that it"
11818,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,goes back to heathen times. Wessex had been converted more than two
11819,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,centuries earlier.
11820,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,
11821,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,
11822,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,
11823,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,We are now in a position to make some estimate of the antiquity of Scyld
11824,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,and Sceaf in the West-Saxon pedigree. The nucleus of this pedigree is to be
11825,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,found in the verses connecting Cynric and Cerdic with Woden. (Even as late
11826,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"as Æthelwulf and Alfred this nucleus is often kept distinct from the later,"
11827,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,more historic stages connecting Cerdic with living men.) Pedigrees of other
11828,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"royal houses go to Woden, and many stop there; however, in times"
11829,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"comparatively early, but yet Christian, we find Woden provided with five"
11830,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"ancestors: later, Ethelwerd gives him ten: the _Chronicle_ gives him"
11831,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,twenty-five. It is evidently a process of accumulation.
11832,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,
11833,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"Now, if the name of Scyld had occurred in the portion of the pedigree which"
11834,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"traces the West-Saxon kings up to Woden, {320} it would possess sufficient"
11835,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"authority to form the basis of an argument. But Scyld, like Heremod, Beaw"
11836,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"and Sceaf, occurs in the fantastic development of the pedigree, by which"
11837,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,Woden is connected up with Adam and Noah. The fact that these heroes occur
11838,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,_above_ Woden makes it almost incredible that their position in the
11839,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,pedigree can go back to heathen times. Those who believed in Woden as a god
11840,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,can hardly have believed at the same time that he was a descendant of the
11841,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"Danish king Scyld. This difficulty Prof. Chadwick admits: ""It is difficult"
11842,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,to believe that in heathen times Woden was credited with five generations
11843,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"of ancestors, as in the _Frealaf-Geat_ list."" Still less is it credible"
11844,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"that he was credited with 25 generations of ancestors, as in the"
11845,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,_Frealaf-Geat-Sceldwa-Sceaf-Noe-Adam_ list.
11846,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,
11847,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,The obvious conclusion seems to me to be that the names above Woden were
11848,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"added in Christian times to the original list, which in heathen times only"
11849,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"went back to Woden, and _which is still extant in this form_. A Christian,"
11850,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"rationalizing Woden as a human magician, would have no difficulty in"
11851,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"placing him far down the ages, just as Saxo Grammaticus does[628]."
11852,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"Obviously _Noe-Adam_ must be an addition of Christian times, and the same"
11853,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"seems to me to apply to all the other names above Woden, which, though"
11854,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"ancient and Germanic, are not therefore ancient and Germanic in the"
11855,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,capacity of ancestors of Woden.
11856,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,
11857,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,And even if these extraordinary ancestors of Woden were really believed in
11858,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"in heathen times, they cannot have been regarded as the special property of"
11859,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,any one nation. For it was never claimed that the West-Saxon kings had any
11860,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"unique distinction in tracing their ancestry to Woden, such as would give"
11861,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,them a special claim upon Woden's forefathers. How then can the ancient
11862,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,belief (if indeed it _were_ an ancient belief) that Woden was descended
11863,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"from Scyld, King of Denmark, prove that the Anglo-Saxons regarded"
11864,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,_themselves_ as specially related to the Danes? For any such relationship
11865,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,derived through Woden must have been shared by all descendants of the
11866,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,All-Father.
11867,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,
11868,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,Prof. Chadwick avoids this difficulty by supposing that Woden did not
11869,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"originally occur in the pedigree, but is a later {321} insertion[629]. But"
11870,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"how can this be so when, of the two forms in which the West-Saxon pedigree"
11871,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"appears, one (and, so far as our evidence goes, much the older one) traces"
11872,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,the kings to Woden _and stops there_. The _object_ of this pedigree is to
11873,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"connect the West-Saxon kings with Woden. The expanded pedigrees, which"
11874,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"carry on the line still further, from Woden to Sceldwa, Sceaf and Adam,"
11875,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"though very numerous, are all traceable to one, or at most two, sources. It"
11876,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,is surely not the right method to regard Woden as an interpolation (though
11877,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"he occurs in that portion of the pedigree which is common to all versions,"
11878,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"some of which we can probably trace back to primitive times), and to regard"
11879,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,as the original element Scyld and Sceaf (though they form part of the
11880,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"continuation of the pedigree found only in, at most, two families of MSS"
11881,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,which we cannot trace back beyond the ninth century).
11882,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,
11883,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"Besides, there is the strongest external support for Woden in the very"

11885,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,in all its texts up to one Baldæg and his father Woden. Those texts which
11886,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,further give Woden's ancestry make him a descendant of Frealaf--they
11887,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"generally make Woden son of Frealaf, though some texts insert an"

11892,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,(e.g. the _Historia Brittonum_) the Northumbrian pedigree stops there: in
11893,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,others (e.g. the _Vespasian MS_) Woden has a father Frealaf. How then _can_
11894,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"it be argued, contrary to the unanimous evidence of all the dozen or more"
11895,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"MSS of the West-Saxon pedigree, that _Woden_, standing as he does between"
11896,C. THE STAGES ABOVE WODEN IN THE WEST-SAXON GENEALOGY,"his proper father and his proper son, is an interpolation? There is no"

11922,CLASSICAL EPIC,A few years ago there was a tendency to exaggerate the value of grammatical

11932,CLASSICAL EPIC,
11933,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Schücking[632], in an elaborate recent monograph on the date of _Beowulf_,"
11934,CLASSICAL EPIC,"rejects the grammatical evidence as valueless, and proceeds to date the"

12001,CLASSICAL EPIC,"leading us to place _Beowulf_ late, would _also_ lead us to place it near"
12002,CLASSICAL EPIC,the time of the conversion. For it is precisely in these times just after
12003,CLASSICAL EPIC,"the conversion, that we get the most striking instances in all Old English"
12004,CLASSICAL EPIC,"history of that ""tact, modesty, generosity, and magnanimity"" which"
12005,CLASSICAL EPIC,Schücking rightly regards as characteristic of _Beowulf_.
12006,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12007,CLASSICAL EPIC,"King Oswin (who was slain in 651) was, Bede tells us, handsome, courteous"
12008,CLASSICAL EPIC,"of speech and bearing, bountiful both to great {325} and lowly, beloved of"
12009,CLASSICAL EPIC,"all men for his qualities of mind and body, so that noblemen came from all"
12010,CLASSICAL EPIC,over England to enter his service--yet of all his endowments gentleness and
12011,CLASSICAL EPIC,humility were the chief. We cannot read the description without being
12012,CLASSICAL EPIC,"reminded of the words of the thegns in praise of the dead Beowulf. Indeed,"
12013,CLASSICAL EPIC,I doubt if Beowulf would have carried gentleness to those around him quite
12014,CLASSICAL EPIC,so far as did Oswin. For Oswin had given to Bishop Aidan an exceptionally
12015,CLASSICAL EPIC,fine horse--and Aidan gave it to a beggar who asked alms. The king's mild
12016,CLASSICAL EPIC,suggestion that a horse of less value would have been good enough for the
12017,CLASSICAL EPIC,"beggar, and that the bishop needed a good horse for his own use, drew from"
12018,CLASSICAL EPIC,"the saint the stern question ""Is that son of a mare dearer to thee than the"
12019,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Son of God?"" The king, who had come from hunting, stood warming himself at"
12020,CLASSICAL EPIC,"the fire, thinking over what had passed; then he suddenly ungirt his sword,"
12021,CLASSICAL EPIC,"gave it to his squire, and throwing himself at the feet of the bishop,"
12022,CLASSICAL EPIC,promised never again to grudge anything he might give in his charities.
12023,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12024,CLASSICAL EPIC,Of course such conduct was exceptional in seventh century Northumbria--it
12025,CLASSICAL EPIC,"convinced Aidan that the king was too good to live long, as indeed proved"
12026,CLASSICAL EPIC,to be the case. But it shows that the ideals of courtesy and gentleness
12027,CLASSICAL EPIC,shown in _Beowulf_ were by no means beyond the possibility of
12028,CLASSICAL EPIC,attainment--were indeed surpassed by a seventh century king. I do not know
12029,CLASSICAL EPIC,if they could be so easily paralleled in later Old English times.
12030,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12031,CLASSICAL EPIC,And what is true from the point of view of morals is true equally from that
12032,CLASSICAL EPIC,of art and learning. In spite of the misfortunes of Northumbrian kings in
12033,CLASSICAL EPIC,"the eighth century, the _first third_ of that century was ""the Golden Age"
12034,CLASSICAL EPIC,"of Anglo-Saxon England[641]."" And not unnaturally, for it had been preceded"
12035,CLASSICAL EPIC,by half a century during which Northumbria had been free both from internal
12036,CLASSICAL EPIC,strife and from invasion. The empire won by Oswiu over Picts and Scots in
12037,CLASSICAL EPIC,the North had been lost at the battle of Nectansmere: but that battle had
12038,CLASSICAL EPIC,"been followed by the twenty years reign of the learned Aldfrid, whose"
12039,CLASSICAL EPIC,scholarship did not prevent him from nobly retrieving the state of the
12040,CLASSICAL EPIC,"kingdom[642], though he could not recover the lost dominions."
12041,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12042,CLASSICAL EPIC,{326}
12043,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12044,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Now, whatever we may think of _Beowulf_ as poetry, it is remarkable for its"
12045,CLASSICAL EPIC,"conscious and deliberate art, and for the tone of civilization which"
12046,CLASSICAL EPIC,"pervades it. And this half century was distinguished, above any other"
12047,CLASSICAL EPIC,"period of Old English history, precisely for its art and its civilization."
12048,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Four and a half centuries later, when the works of great Norman master"
12049,CLASSICAL EPIC,"builders were rising everywhere in the land, the buildings which Bishop"
12050,CLASSICAL EPIC,Wilfrid had put up during this first period of conversion were still
12051,CLASSICAL EPIC,"objects of admiration, even for those who had seen the glories of the great"
12052,CLASSICAL EPIC,Roman basilicas[643].
12053,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12054,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Nor is there anything surprising in the fact that this ""golden age"" was not"
12055,CLASSICAL EPIC,"maintained. On the contrary, it is ""in accordance with the phenomena of"
12056,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Saxon history in general, in which seasons of brilliant promise are"
12057,CLASSICAL EPIC,succeeded by long eras of national eclipse. It is from this point of view
12058,CLASSICAL EPIC,quite in accordance with natural likelihood that the age of conversion was
12059,CLASSICAL EPIC,one of such stimulus to the artistic powers of the people that a level of
12060,CLASSICAL EPIC,effort and achievement was reached which subsequent generations were not
12061,CLASSICAL EPIC,able to maintain. The carved crosses and the coins certainly degenerate in
12062,CLASSICAL EPIC,"artistic value as the centuries pass away, and the fine barbaric gold and"
12063,CLASSICAL EPIC,"encrusted work is early in date[644]."""
12064,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12065,CLASSICAL EPIC,Already in the early part of the eighth century signs of decay are to be
12066,CLASSICAL EPIC,"observed. At the end of his _Ecclesiastical History_, Bede complains that"
12067,CLASSICAL EPIC,"the times are so full of disturbance that one knows not what to say, or"
12068,CLASSICAL EPIC,what the end will be. And these fears were justified. A hundred and forty
12069,CLASSICAL EPIC,"years of turmoil and decay follow, till the civilization of the North and"
12070,CLASSICAL EPIC,"the Midlands was overthrown by the Danes, and York became the uneasy seat"
12071,CLASSICAL EPIC,of a heathen jarl.
12072,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12073,CLASSICAL EPIC,"How it should be possible to see in these facts, as contrasted with the"
12074,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Christian and civilized tone of _Beowulf_, any argument for late date, I"
12075,CLASSICAL EPIC,"cannot see. On the contrary, because of its Christian civilization combined"
12076,CLASSICAL EPIC,"with its still vivid, if perhaps not always quite exact, recollection of"
12077,CLASSICAL EPIC,"heathen customs, we should be inclined to put _Beowulf_ in the early"
12078,CLASSICAL EPIC,Christian ages.
12079,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12080,CLASSICAL EPIC,{327}
12081,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12082,CLASSICAL EPIC,A further argument put forward for this late date is the old one that the
12083,CLASSICAL EPIC,Scandinavian sympathies of _Beowulf_ show it to have been composed for a
12084,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Scandinavian court, the court, Schücking thinks, of one of the princes who"
12085,CLASSICAL EPIC,ruled over those portions of England which the Danes had settled[645]. Of
12086,CLASSICAL EPIC,course Schücking is too sound a scholar to revive at this time of day the
12087,CLASSICAL EPIC,old fallacy that the Anglo-Saxons ought to have taken no interest in the
12088,CLASSICAL EPIC,"deeds of any but Anglo-Saxon heroes. But how, he asks, are we to account"
12089,CLASSICAL EPIC,"for such _enthusiasm_ for, such a burning interest in, a people of alien"
12090,CLASSICAL EPIC,"dialect and foreign dynasty, such as the Scyldings of Denmark?"
12091,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12092,CLASSICAL EPIC,The answer seems to me to be that the enthusiasm of _Beowulf_ is not for
12093,CLASSICAL EPIC,"the Danish nation as such: on the contrary, _Beowulf_ depicts a situation"
12094,CLASSICAL EPIC,which is most humiliating to the Danes. For twelve years they have suffered
12095,CLASSICAL EPIC,the depredations of Grendel; Hrothgar and his kin have proved helpless: all
12096,CLASSICAL EPIC,the Danes have been unequal to the need. Twice at least this is emphasized
12097,CLASSICAL EPIC,"in the most uncompromising, and indeed insulting, way[646]. The poet's"
12098,CLASSICAL EPIC,"enthusiasm is not, then, for the Danish race as such, but for the ideal of"
12099,CLASSICAL EPIC,a great court with its body of retainers. Such retainers are not
12100,CLASSICAL EPIC,necessarily native born--rather is it the mark of the great court that it
12101,CLASSICAL EPIC,"draws men from far and wide to enter the service, whether permanently or"
12102,CLASSICAL EPIC,"temporarily, even as Beowulf came from afar to help the aged Hrothgar in"
12103,CLASSICAL EPIC,his need.
12104,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12105,CLASSICAL EPIC,"It is this ideal of personal valour and personal loyalty, rather than of"
12106,CLASSICAL EPIC,"tribal patriotism, which pervades _Beowulf_, and which certainly suits the"
12107,CLASSICAL EPIC,known facts of the seventh and early eighth centuries. The bitterest strife
12108,CLASSICAL EPIC,in England in the seventh century had been between the two quite new states
12109,CLASSICAL EPIC,"of Northumbria and Mercia, both equally of Anglian race. Both these states"
12110,CLASSICAL EPIC,"had been built up by a combination of smaller units, and not without"
12111,CLASSICAL EPIC,violating the old local patriotisms of the diverse elements from which they
12112,CLASSICAL EPIC,"had been formed. At first, at any rate, no such thing as Northumbrian or"
12113,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Mercian patriotism can have existed. Loyalty was personal, to the king."
12114,CLASSICAL EPIC,Neither the kingdom nor the _comitatus_ was homogeneous. We have seen {328}
12115,CLASSICAL EPIC,that Bede mentions it as a peculiar honour to a Northumbrian prince that
12116,CLASSICAL EPIC,_from all parts of England_ nobles came to enter his service. We must not
12117,CLASSICAL EPIC,demand from the seventh or eighth century our ideals of exclusive
12118,CLASSICAL EPIC,"enthusiasm for the land of one's birth, ideals which make it disreputable"
12119,CLASSICAL EPIC,"for a ""mercenary"" to sell his sword. The ideal is, on the contrary, loyalty"
12120,CLASSICAL EPIC,to a prince whose service a warrior _voluntarily_ enters. And the Danish
12121,CLASSICAL EPIC,court is depicted as a pattern of such loyalty--before the Scyldings began
12122,CLASSICAL EPIC,"to work evil[647], by the treason of Hrothulf."
12123,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12124,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Further, the fact that the Danish court at Leire had been a heathen one"
12125,CLASSICAL EPIC,"might be matter for regret, but it would not prevent its being praised by"
12126,CLASSICAL EPIC,an Englishman about 700. For England was then entirely Christian. In the
12127,CLASSICAL EPIC,"process of conversion no single Christian had, so far as we know, been"
12128,CLASSICAL EPIC,martyred. There had been no war of religion. If Penda had fought against
12129,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Oswald, it had been as the king of Mercia against the king of Northumbria."
12130,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Penda's allies were Christian, and he showed no antipathy to the new"
12131,CLASSICAL EPIC,faith[648]. So that at this date there was no reason for men to feel any
12132,CLASSICAL EPIC,deep hostility towards a heathendom which had been the faith of their
12133,CLASSICAL EPIC,"grandfathers, and with which there had never been any embittered conflict."
12134,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12135,CLASSICAL EPIC,But in 900 the position was quite different. For more than a generation the
12136,CLASSICAL EPIC,country had been engaged in a life-and-death struggle between two warring
12137,CLASSICAL EPIC,"camps, the ""Christian men"" and the ""heathen men."" The ""heathen men"" were in"
12138,CLASSICAL EPIC,"process of conversion, but were liable to be ever recruited afresh from"
12139,CLASSICAL EPIC,beyond the sea. It seems highly unlikely that _Beowulf_ could have been
12140,CLASSICAL EPIC,"written at this date, by some English poet, for the court of a converted"
12141,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Scandinavian prince, with a view perhaps, as Schücking suggests, to"
12142,CLASSICAL EPIC,educating his children in the English speech. In such a case the one thing
12143,CLASSICAL EPIC,"likely to be avoided by the English poet, with more than two centuries of"
12144,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Christianity behind him, would surely have been the praise of that"
12145,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Scandinavian heathendom, from which his patron had freed himself, and from"
12146,CLASSICAL EPIC,which his children were to be weaned. The martyrdom of S. Edmund might have
12147,CLASSICAL EPIC,seemed a more appropriate theme[649]. {329} The tolerant attitude towards
12148,CLASSICAL EPIC,"heathen customs, and the almost antiquarian interest in them, very justly,"
12149,CLASSICAL EPIC,"as it seems to me, emphasized by Schücking[650], is surely far more"
12150,CLASSICAL EPIC,possible in A.D. 700 than in A.D. 900. For between those dates heathendom
12151,CLASSICAL EPIC,"had ceased to be an antiquarian curiosity, and had become an imminent"
12152,CLASSICAL EPIC,peril.
12153,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12154,CLASSICAL EPIC,"If those are right who hold that _Beowulf_ is no purely native growth, but"
12155,CLASSICAL EPIC,"shows influence of the classical epic, then again it is easier to credit"
12156,CLASSICAL EPIC,such influence about the year 700 than 900. At the earlier date we have
12157,CLASSICAL EPIC,"scholars like Aldhelm and Bede, both well acquainted with Virgil, yet both"
12158,CLASSICAL EPIC,"interested in vernacular verse. It has been urged, as a _reductio ad"
12159,CLASSICAL EPIC,"absurdum_ of the view which would connect _Beowulf_ with Virgil, that the"
12160,CLASSICAL EPIC,relation to the _Odyssey_ is more obvious than that to the _Æneid_.
12161,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Perhaps, however, some remote and indirect connection even between"
12162,CLASSICAL EPIC,"_Beowulf_ and the _Odyssey_ is not altogether unthinkable, about the year"
12163,CLASSICAL EPIC,700. At the end of the seventh century there was a flourishing school of
12164,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Greek learning in England, under Hadrian and the Greek Archbishop Theodore,"
12165,CLASSICAL EPIC,"both ""well read in sacred _and in secular_ literature."" In 730 their"
12166,CLASSICAL EPIC,"scholars were still alive, and, Bede tells us, could speak Greek and Latin"
12167,CLASSICAL EPIC,as correctly as their native tongue. Bede himself knew something about the
12168,CLASSICAL EPIC,"_Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_. Not till eight centuries have passed, and we"
12169,CLASSICAL EPIC,"reach Grocyn and Linacre, was it again to be as easy for an Englishman to"
12170,CLASSICAL EPIC,have a first-hand knowledge of a Greek classic as it was about the year
12171,CLASSICAL EPIC,"700. What scholarship had sunk to by the days of Alfred, we know: and we"
12172,CLASSICAL EPIC,know that all Alfred's patronage did not produce any scholar whom we can
12173,CLASSICAL EPIC,think of as in the least degree comparable to Bede.
12174,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12175,CLASSICAL EPIC,"So that from the point of view of its close touch with heathendom, its"
12176,CLASSICAL EPIC,"tolerance for heathen customs, its Christian magnanimity and gentleness,"
12177,CLASSICAL EPIC,"its conscious art, and its learned tone, all historic and artistic analogy"
12178,CLASSICAL EPIC,would lead us to place _Beowulf_ in the great age--the age of Bede.
12179,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12180,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12181,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12182,CLASSICAL EPIC,This has brought us to another question--more interesting to many than the
12183,CLASSICAL EPIC,mere question of date. Are we to suppose {330} any direct connection
12184,CLASSICAL EPIC,between the classical and the Old English epic?
12185,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12186,CLASSICAL EPIC,"As nations pass through their ""Heroic Age,"" similar social conditions will"
12187,CLASSICAL EPIC,necessarily be reflected by many similarities in their poetry. In heroic
12188,CLASSICAL EPIC,"lays like _Finnsburg_ or _Hildebrand_ or the Norse poems, phrases and"
12189,CLASSICAL EPIC,situations may occur which remind us of phrases and situations in the
12190,CLASSICAL EPIC,"_Iliad_, without affording any ground for supposing classical influence"
12191,CLASSICAL EPIC,direct or indirect.
12192,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12193,CLASSICAL EPIC,But there is much more in _Beowulf_ than mere accidental coincidence of
12194,CLASSICAL EPIC,phrase or situation.
12195,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12196,CLASSICAL EPIC,A simple-minded romancer would have made the _Æneid_ a biography of Æneas
12197,CLASSICAL EPIC,from the cradle to the grave. Not so Virgil. The story begins with mention
12198,CLASSICAL EPIC,of Carthage. Æneas then comes on the scene. At a banquet he tells to Dido
12199,CLASSICAL EPIC,"his earlier adventures. Just so _Beowulf_ begins, not with the birth of"
12200,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Beowulf and his boyhood, but with Heorot. Beowulf arrives. At the banquet,"
12201,CLASSICAL EPIC,"in reply to Unferth, he narrates his earlier adventures. The _Beowulf_-poet"
12202,CLASSICAL EPIC,"is not content merely to tell us that there was minstrelsy at the feast,"
12203,CLASSICAL EPIC,"but like Virgil or Homer, he must give an account of what was sung. The"
12204,CLASSICAL EPIC,epic style leads often to almost verbal similarities. Jupiter consoling
12205,CLASSICAL EPIC,Hercules for the loss of the son of his host says:
12206,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12207,CLASSICAL EPIC,"stat sua cuique dies, breve et inreparabile tempus"
12208,CLASSICAL EPIC,omnibus est vitae; sed famam extendere factis
12209,CLASSICAL EPIC,hoc virtutis opus[651].
12210,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12211,CLASSICAL EPIC,In the same spirit and almost in the same words does Beowulf console
12212,CLASSICAL EPIC,Hrothgar for the loss of his friend:
12213,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12214,CLASSICAL EPIC,[=U]re [=æ]ghwylc sceal ende geb[=i]dan
12215,CLASSICAL EPIC,worolde l[=i]fes; wyrce s[=e] þe m[=o]te
12216,CLASSICAL EPIC,d[=o]mes [=æ]r d[=e]aþe; þæt biþ drihtguman
12217,CLASSICAL EPIC,unlifgendum æfter s[=e]lest.
12218,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12219,CLASSICAL EPIC,"On the other hand, though we are often struck by the likeness in spirit and"
12220,CLASSICAL EPIC,"in plan, it must be allowed that there is no tangible or conclusive proof"
12221,CLASSICAL EPIC,of borrowing[652]. But the influence may have been none the less effective
12222,CLASSICAL EPIC,"for being indirect: nor is {331} it quite certain that the author, had he"
12223,CLASSICAL EPIC,"known his Virgil, would necessarily have left traces of direct borrowing."
12224,CLASSICAL EPIC,"For the deep Christian feeling, which has given to _Beowulf_ its almost"
12225,CLASSICAL EPIC,"prudish propriety and its edifying tone, is manifested by no direct and"
12226,CLASSICAL EPIC,dogmatic reference to Christian personages or doctrines.
12227,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12228,CLASSICAL EPIC,I sympathize with Prof. Chadwick's feeling that a man who knew Virgil would
12229,CLASSICAL EPIC,"not have disguised his knowledge, and would probably have lacked both"
12230,CLASSICAL EPIC,inclination and ability to compose such a poem as _Beowulf_[653]. But does
12231,CLASSICAL EPIC,not this feeling rest largely upon the analogy of other races and ages? Is
12232,CLASSICAL EPIC,it borne out by such known facts as we can gather about this period? The
12233,CLASSICAL EPIC,reticence of _Beowulf_ with reference to Christianity does not harmonize
12234,CLASSICAL EPIC,with one's preconceived ideas; and Bishop Aldhelm gives us an even greater
12235,CLASSICAL EPIC,"surprise. Let anyone read, or try to read, Aldhelm's _Epistola ad Acircium,"
12236,CLASSICAL EPIC,"sive liber de septenario et de metris_. Let him then ask himself ""Is it"
12237,CLASSICAL EPIC,possible that this learned pedant can also have been the author of English
12238,CLASSICAL EPIC,poems which King Alfred--surely no mean judge--thought best of all he
12239,CLASSICAL EPIC,"knew?"" These poems may of course have been educated and learned in tone."
12240,CLASSICAL EPIC,But we have the authority of King Alfred for the fact that Aldhelm used to
12241,CLASSICAL EPIC,"perform at the cross roads as a common minstrel, and that he could hold his"
12242,CLASSICAL EPIC,audiences with such success that they resorted to him again and again[654].
12243,CLASSICAL EPIC,Only after he had made himself popular by several performances did he
12244,CLASSICAL EPIC,"attempt to weave edifying matter into his verse. And the popular, secular"
12245,CLASSICAL EPIC,"poetry of Aldhelm, his _carmen triviale_, remained current among the common"
12246,CLASSICAL EPIC,"people for centuries. Nor was Aldhelm's classical knowledge of late growth,"
12247,CLASSICAL EPIC,"something superimposed upon an earlier love of popular poetry, for he had"
12248,CLASSICAL EPIC,{332} studied under Hadrian as a boy[655]. Later we are told that King Ine
12249,CLASSICAL EPIC,imported two Greek teachers from Athens for the help of Aldhelm and his
12250,CLASSICAL EPIC,school[656]; this may be exaggeration.
12251,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12252,CLASSICAL EPIC,Everything seems to show that about 700 an atmosphere existed in England
12253,CLASSICAL EPIC,"which might easily have led a scholarly Englishman, acquainted with the old"
12254,CLASSICAL EPIC,"lays, to have set to work to compose an epic. Even so venerable a person as"
12255,CLASSICAL EPIC,"Bede, during his last illness, uttered his last teaching not, as we should"
12256,CLASSICAL EPIC,"expect on _a priori_ grounds, in Latin hexameters, but in English metre."
12257,CLASSICAL EPIC,"The evidence for this is conclusive[657]. But, at a later date, Alcuin"
12258,CLASSICAL EPIC,would surely have condemned the minstrelsy of Aldhelm[658]. Even King
12259,CLASSICAL EPIC,Alfred seems to have felt that it needed some apology. It would have
12260,CLASSICAL EPIC,rendered Aldhelm liable to severe censure under the Laws of King
12261,CLASSICAL EPIC,Edgar[659]; and Dunstan's biographer indignantly denies the charge brought
12262,CLASSICAL EPIC,against his hero of having learnt the heathen songs of his
12263,CLASSICAL EPIC,forefathers[660].
12264,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12265,CLASSICAL EPIC,"The evidence is not as plentiful as we might wish, but it rather suggests"
12266,CLASSICAL EPIC,that the chasm between secular poetry and ecclesiastical learning was more
12267,CLASSICAL EPIC,easily bridged in the first generations after the conversion than was the
12268,CLASSICAL EPIC,case later.
12269,CLASSICAL EPIC,
12270,CLASSICAL EPIC,"But, however that may be, it assuredly does not give any grounds for"
12271,CLASSICAL EPIC,"abandoning the old view, based largely upon grammatical and metrical"
12272,CLASSICAL EPIC,"considerations, which would make _Beowulf_ a product of the early eighth"
12273,CLASSICAL EPIC,"century, and substituting for it a theory which would make our poem a"
12274,CLASSICAL EPIC,product of mixed Saxon and Danish society in the early tenth century.

12297,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",opening chapters of Scandinavian history turns upon it.
12298,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12299,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Supporters of the ""Jute-theory"" have seldom approached the subject from the"
12300,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",point of view of Old English. Bugge[664] perhaps did so: but the
12301,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","""Jute-theory"" has been held chiefly by students of Scandinavian history,"
12302,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","literature or geography, like Fahlbeck[665], Steenstrup[666], Gering[667],"
12303,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Olrik[668], Schütte[669] and Kier[670]. But, now that the laws of Old"
12304,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","English sound-change have been {334} clearly defined, it seldom happens"
12305,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",that anyone who approaches the subject primarily as a student of the
12306,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",Anglo-Saxon language holds the view that the Geatas are Jutes.
12307,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12308,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","And this is naturally so: for, from the point of view of language, the"
12309,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",question is not disputable. The _G[=e]atas_ phonologically are the _Gautar_
12310,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",(the modern Götar of Southern Sweden). It is admitted that the words are
12311,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","identical[671]. And, equally, it is admitted that the word _G[=e]atas_"
12312,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","cannot be identical with the word _Iuti_, _Iutae_, used by Bede as the name"
12313,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","of the Jutes who colonized Kent[671]. Bede's _Iuti_, _Iutae_, on the"
12314,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","contrary, would correspond to a presumed Old English _*[=I]uti_ or"
12315,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","_*[=I]utan_[672], current in his time in Northumbria. This in later"
12316,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Northumbrian would become _[=I]ote_, _[=I]otan_ (though the form _[=I]ute_,"
12317,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",_[=I]utan_ might also survive). The dialect forms which we should expect
12318,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",(and which we find in the genitive and dative) corresponding to this would
12319,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","be: Mercian, _[=E]ote_, _[=E]otan_; Late West-Saxon, _[=Y]te_, _[=Y]tan_"
12320,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","(through an intermediate Early West-Saxon _*[=I]ete_, _*[=I]etan_, which is"
12321,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",not recorded).
12322,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12323,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","If, then, the word _G[=e]atas_ came to supplant the correct form _[=I]ote_,"
12324,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","_[=I]otan_ (or its Mercian and West-Saxon equivalents _[=E]ote_,"
12325,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","_[=E]otan_, _[=Y]te_, _[=Y]tan_), this can only have been the result of"
12326,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","confusion. Such confusion is, on abstract grounds, conceivable: it is"
12327,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",always possible that the name of one tribe may come to be attached to
12328,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","another. ""Scot"" has ceased to mean ""Irishman,"" and has come to mean ""North"
12329,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Briton""; and there is no intrinsic impossibility in the word _G[=e]atas_"
12330,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","having been transferred by Englishmen, from the half-forgotten Gautar, to"
12331,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","the Jutes, and having driven out the correct name of the latter, _[=I]ote_,"
12332,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","_[=I]otan_. For example, there might have been an exiled Geatic family"
12333,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","among the Jutish invaders, which might have become so prominent as to cause"
12334,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","{335} the name _G[=e]atas_ to supplant the correct _[=I]ote_, _[=E]ote_,"
12335,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","etc. But, whoever the Geatas may have been, _Beowulf_ is their chief early"
12336,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","record: indeed, almost all we know of their earliest history is derived"
12337,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","from _Beowulf_. In _Beowulf_, therefore, if anywhere, the old names and"
12338,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",traditions should be remembered. The word _G[=e]at_ occurs some 50 times in
12339,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","the poem. The poet obviously wishes to use other synonyms, for the sake of"
12340,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","variety and alliteration: hence we get _Weder-G[=e]atas_, _Wederas_,"
12341,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","_S[=æ]-G[=e]atas_, _G[=u]ð-G[=e]atas_. Now, if these Geatas are the Jutes,"
12342,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","how comes it that the poet _never_ calls them such, never speaks of them"
12343,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","under the correct tribal name of _[=E]ote_, etc., although this was the"
12344,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","current name at the time _Beowulf_ was written, and indeed for centuries"
12345,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",later?
12346,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12347,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","For, demonstrably, the form _[=E]ote_, etc., _was_ recognized as the name"
12348,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",of the Jutes till at least the twelfth century. Then it died out of current
12349,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","speech, and only Bede's Latin _Iuti_ (and the modern ""Jute"" derived"
12350,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",therefrom) remained as terms used by the historians. The evidence is
12351,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",conclusive:
12352,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12353,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","(_a_) Bede, writing about the time when _Beowulf_, in its present form, is"
12354,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","supposed to have been composed, uses _Iuti_, _Iutae_, corresponding to a"
12355,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","presumed contemporary Northumbrian _*[=I]uti_, _*[=I]utan_."
12356,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12357,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","(_b_) In the O.E. translation of Bede, made in Mercia perhaps two centuries"
12358,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","after Bede's time, we do indeed in one place find ""Geata,"" ""Geatum"" used to"
12359,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","translate ""Iutarum,"" ""Iutis,"" instead of the correctly corresponding"
12360,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Mercian form ""Eota,"" ""Eotum."" Only two MSS are extant at this point. But"
12361,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","since both agree, and since they belong to different types, it is probable"
12362,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","that ""Geata"" here is no mere copyist's error, but is due to the translator"
12363,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","himself[673]. But, later, when the translator {336} has to render Bede's"
12364,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","""Iutorum,"" he gives, not ""Geata,"" but the correct Mercian ""Eota."" There can"
12365,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","be no possible doubt here, for five MSS are extant at this point, and all"
12366,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","give the correct form--four in the Mercian, ""Eota,"" whilst one gives the"
12367,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","West-Saxon equivalent, ""Ytena."""
12368,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12369,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",Now the _G[=e]ata_-passage in the Bede translation is the chief piece of
12370,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","evidence which those who would explain the Geatas of _Beowulf_ as ""Jutes"""
12371,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","can call: and it does not, in fact, much help them. What they have to prove"
12372,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",is that the _Beowulf_-poet could _consistently and invariably_ have used
12373,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",_G[=e]atas_ in the place of _[=E]ote_. To produce an instance in which the
12374,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","two terms are both used by the same translator is very little use, when"
12375,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","what has to be proved is that the one term had already, at a much earlier"
12376,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","period, entirely ousted the other."
12377,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12378,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",All our other evidence is for the invariable use of the correct form
12379,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","_[=I]ote_, _[=I]otan_, etc. in Old English."
12380,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12381,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","(_c_) The passage from Bede was again translated, and inserted into a copy"
12382,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, which was sent quite early to one of the"
12383,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","great abbeys of Northumbria[674]. In this, ""Iutis, Iutarum"" is represented"
12384,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","by the correct Northumbrian equivalent, ""Iutum,"" ""Iotum""; ""Iutna."""
12385,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12386,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","(_d_) This Northumbrian Chronicle, or a transcript of it, subsequently came"
12387,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","South, to Canterbury. There, roughly about the year 1100, it was used to"
12388,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",interpolate an Early West-Saxon copy of the Chronicle. Surely at
12389,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Canterbury, the capital of the old Jutish kingdom, people must have known"
12390,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","the correct form of the Jutish name, whether _G[=e]atas_ or _[=I]ote_. We"
12391,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","find the forms ""Iotum,"" ""Iutum""; ""Iutna."""
12392,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12393,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","(_e_) Corresponding to this Northumbrian (and Kentish) form _[=I]ote_,"
12394,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Mercian _[=E]ote_, the Late West-Saxon form should be _[=Y]te_. Now _MS"
12395,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Corpus Christi College, Cambridge_, 41, gives us ""the Wessex version of the"
12396,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","English Bede"" and is written by a scribe who knew the Hampshire"
12397,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","district[675]. In this MS the ""Eota"" of the Mercian original has been"
12398,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","transcribed as ""Ytena,"" ""Eotum"" as ""Ytum,"" showing that the scribe"
12399,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",understood the tribal name and its equivalent correctly. This was about the
12400,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","{337} time of the Norman Conquest, but the name continued to be understood"
12401,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",till the early twelfth century at least. For Florence of Worcester records
12402,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",that William Rufus was slain _in Noua Foresta quae lingua Anglorum Ytene
12403,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",nuncupatur_; and in another place he speaks of the same event as happening
12404,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","_in prouincia Jutarum in Noua Foresta_[676], which shows that Florence"
12405,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","understood that ""Ytene"" was _[=Y]tena land_, ""the province of the Jutes."""
12406,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12407,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12408,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12409,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","It comes, then, to this. The ""Jute-hypothesis"" postulates not only that, at"
12410,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","the time _Beowulf_ was composed, _G[=e]atas_ had come to mean ""Jutes,"" but"
12411,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","also that it had so completely ousted the correct old name _[=I]uti,"
12412,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","[=I]ote, [=E]ote, [=Y]te_, that none of the latter terms are ever used in"
12413,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",the poem as synonyms for Beowulf's people[677]. Yet all the evidence shows
12414,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","that _[=I]uti_ etc. was the recognized name when Bede wrote, and we have"
12415,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",evidence at intervals showing that it was so understood till four centuries
12416,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","later. But not only was _[=I]uti_, _[=I]ote_ never superseded in O.E."
12417,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",times; there is no real evidence that _G[=e]atas_ was ever _generally_ used
12418,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","to signify ""Jutes."" The fact that one translator in one passage (writing"
12419,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","probably some two centuries after _Beowulf_ was composed) uses ""Geata,"""
12420,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","""Geatum,"" where he should have used ""Eota,"" ""Eotum,"" does not prove the"
12421,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",misnomer to have been general--especially when the same translator
12422,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","subsequently uses the correct form ""Eota."""
12423,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12424,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",I do not think sufficient importance has been attached to what seems (to
12425,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","me) the vital argument against the ""Jute-theory."" It is not merely that"
12426,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",_G[=e]atas_ is the exact phonological equivalent of _Gautar_ (Götar) and
12427,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",cannot be equivalent to Bede's _Iuti_. This difficulty may be got over by
12428,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","the assumption that somehow the _Iuti_, or some of them, had adopted the"
12429,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",name _G[=e]atas_: and we are not in a position to disprove such assumption.
12430,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","But the advocates of the ""Jute-theory"" have further to assume that, at the"
12431,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","date when _Beowulf_ was written, the correct name _Iuti_ (Northumbrian"
12432,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","_[=I]ote_, Mercian _[=E]ote_, West-Saxon _[=Y]te_) must have so passed into"
12433,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",disuse that it could not be once used as a {338} synonym for Beowulf's
12434,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","people, by our synonym-hunting poet. And this assumption we _are_ in a"
12435,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",position to disprove.
12436,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12437,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12438,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12439,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",The Jute-theory would therefore still be untenable on the ground of the
12440,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","name, even though it were laboriously proved that, from the historical and"
12441,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","geographical standpoint, there was more to be said for it than had hitherto"
12442,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",been recognized. But even this has not been proved: quite the reverse. As I
12443,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","have tried to show above, historical and geographical considerations,"
12444,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","though in themselves not absolutely conclusive, point emphatically to an"
12445,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","identification with the Götar, rather than with the Jutes[678]."
12446,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12447,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",The relations of Beowulf and the Geatas with the kings of Denmark and of
12448,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",Sweden are the constant topic of the poem. Now the land of the Götar _was_
12449,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","situated between Denmark and Sweden. But if the Geatas be Jutes, their"
12450,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",neighbours were the Danes on the east and the Angles on the south; farther
12451,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","away, across the Cattegat lay the Götar, and beyond these the Swedes. If"
12452,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","the Geatas be Jutes, why should their immediate neighbours, the Angles,"
12453,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","never appear in _Beowulf_ as having any dealings with them? And why, above"
12454,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","all, should the Götar never be mentioned, whilst the Swedes, far to the"
12455,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","north, play so large a part? Even if Swedes and Götar had at this time been"
12456,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","under one king, the Götar could not have been thus ignored, seeing that,"
12457,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","owing to their position, the brunt of the fighting must have fallen on"
12458,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",them[679]. But we know that the Götar were independent. The strictly
12459,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",contemporary evidence of Procopius shows quite conclusively that they were
12460,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",one of the strongest of the Scandinavian kingdoms[680]. How then could
12461,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",warfare be carried on for three generations between Jutes and Swedes
12462,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","without concerning the Götar, whose territory lay in between?"
12463,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12464,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Again, in the ""Catalogue of Kings"" in _Widsith_, the Swedes are named with"
12465,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","their famous king Ongentheow. The Jutes (_[=Y]te_) are also mentioned, with"
12466,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","_their_ king. And their king is {339} not Hrethel, Hæthcyn, Hygelac or"
12467,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Heardred, but a certain Gefwulf, whose name does not even alliterate with"
12468,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",that of any known king of the Geatas[681].
12469,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12470,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Again, in the (certainly very early) _Book on Monsters_, Hygelac is"
12471,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",described as _Huiglaucus qui imperavit Getis_. Now Getis can mean
12472,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Götar[682], but can hardly mean Jutes."
12473,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12474,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",The geographical case against the identification of Geatas and Götar
12475,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",depends upon the assumption that the western sea-coast of the Götar in
12476,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",ancient times must have coincided with that of West Gothland
12477,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",(Vestra-Götland) in mediæval and modern times. Now as this coast consists
12478,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","merely of a small strip south of the river Götaelv, it is argued that the"
12479,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Götar could not be the maritime Geatas of _Beowulf_, capable of undertaking"
12480,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",a Viking raid to the mouth of the Rhine. But the assumption that the
12481,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",frontiers of the Götar about A.D. 500 were the same as they were a thousand
12482,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","years later, is not only improbable on _a priori_ grounds, but, as Schück"
12483,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","has shown[683], can be definitely disproved. Adam of Bremen, writing in the"
12484,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","eleventh century, speaks of the river Gothelba (Götaelv) as running through"
12485,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",the midst of the peoples of the Götar. And the obvious connection between
12486,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",the name of the river and the name of the people seems to make it certain
12487,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","that Adam is right, and that the original Götar must have dwelt around the"
12488,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","river Götaelv. But, if so, then they were a maritime folk: for the river"
12489,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Götaelv is merely the outlet which connects Lake Wener with the sea,"
12490,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",running a course almost parallel with the shore and nowhere very distant
12491,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","from it[684]. But even when Adam wrote, the {340} Götar to the north of the"
12492,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",river had long been politically subject to Norway[685]: and the
12493,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",_Heimskringla_ tells us how this happened.
12494,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12495,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Harold Fairhair, King of Norway (a contemporary of King Alfred), attacked"
12496,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","them: they had staked the river Götaelv against him, but he moored his"
12497,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",ships to the stakes[686] and harried _on either shore_: he fought far and
12498,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","wide in the country, had many battles _on either side of the river_, and"
12499,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","finally slew the leader of the Götar, Hrani Gauzki (the Götlander). Then he"
12500,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",annexed to Norway all the land north of the river and west of Lake Wener.
12501,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",Thenceforward the Götaelv was the boundary between Norway and West
12502,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Gothland, though the country ultimately became Swedish, as it now is. But"
12503,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",it is abundantly clear from the _Heimskringla_ that Harold regarded as

12583,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12584,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",It is repeatedly objected that the Götar are remote from the
12585,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",Anglo-Saxons[704]. Possibly: but remoteness did not prevent {343} the
12586,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",Anglo-Saxons from being interested in heroes of the Huns or Goths or
12587,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Burgundians or Longobards, who were much more[705] distant. And the absence"
12588,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",of any direct connection between the history of the Geatas and the historic
12589,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Anglo-Saxon records, affords a strong presumption that the Geatas _were_ a"

12591,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","the same people as the Jutes who colonized Kent and Hampshire, why do we"
12592,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","never, in the Kentish royal genealogies or elsewhere, find any claim to"
12593,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",such connection? The Mercians did not so forget their connection with the
12594,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","old Offa of Angel, although a much greater space of time had intervened."
12595,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",The fact that we have no mention among the ancestors of Beowulf and Hygelac
12596,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","of any names which we can connect with the Jutish genealogy affords,"

12598,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12599,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","The strongest historical argument for the ""Jute-theory"" was that produced"
12600,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",by Bugge. The _Ynglinga tal_ represents Ottar (who is certainly the Ohthere
12601,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","of _Beowulf_) as having fallen in Vendel, and this Vendel was clearly"
12602,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",understood as being the district of that name in North Jutland. The body of
12603,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","this Swedish king was torn asunder by carrion birds, and he was remembered"
12604,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","as ""the Vendel-crow,"" a mocking nickname which pretty clearly goes back to"
12605,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","primitive times. Other ancient authors attributed this name, not to Ottar,"
12606,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","but to his father, who can be identified with the Ongentheow of _Beowulf_."
12607,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",This would seem to indicate that the hereditary foes of Ongentheow and the
12608,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Swedish kings of his house were, after all, the Jutes of Vendel."
12609,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12610,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","But Knut Stjerna has shown that the Vendel from which ""Ottar Vendel-crow"""
12611,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","took his name was probably not the Vendel of Jutland at all, but the place"
12612,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","of that name north of Uppsala, famous for the splendid grave-finds which"
12613,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",show it to have been of peculiar importance during our period[706]. And
12614,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","subsequent research has shown that a huge grave-mound, near this Vendel, is"
12615,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",mentioned in a record of the seventeenth century as King {344} Ottar's
12616,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","mound, and is still popularly known as the mound of Ottar Vendel-crow[707]."
12617,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","But, if so, this story of the Vendel-crow, so far from supporting the"
12618,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","""Jute-hypothesis,"" tells against it: nothing could be more suitable than"
12619,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Vendel, north of Uppsala, as the ""last ditch"" to which Ongentheow"
12620,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","retreated, if we assume his adversaries to have been the Götar: but it"
12621,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",would not suit the Jutes so well.
12622,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12623,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",An exploration of the mound has proved beyond reasonable doubt that it
12624,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","_was_ raised to cover the ashes of Ottar Vendel-crow, the Ohthere of"
12625,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",_Beowulf_[708]. That Ohthere fell in battle against the Geatas there is
12626,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","nothing, in _Beowulf_ or elsewhere, to prove. But the fact that his ashes"
12627,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",were laid in mound at Vendel in Sweden makes it unlikely that he fell in
12628,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","battle against the Jutes, and is quite incompatible with what we are told"
12629,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",in the _Ynglinga saga_ of his body having been torn to pieces by carrion
12630,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","fowl on a mound in Vendel in Jutland. It now becomes clear that this story,"
12631,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",and the tale of the crow of wood made by the Jutlanders in mockery of
12632,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","Ottar, is a mere invention to account for the name Vendel-crow: the name,"
12633,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","as so often, has survived, and a new story has grown up to give a reason"
12634,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",for the name.
12635,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",
12636,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","What ""Vendel-crow"" originally implied we cannot be quite sure. Apparently"

12638,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED",inhabitants of Swedish Vendel. Ottar may have been so called because he was
12639,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","buried (possibly because he lived) in Vendel, not, like other members of"
12640,"E. THE ""JUTE-QUESTION"" REOPENED","his race, his son and his father, at Old Uppsala. But however that may be,"

12723,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
12724,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Now Stjerna, very rightly and naturally, drew his illustrations of"
12725,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"_Beowulf_ from those Scandinavian, and especially Swedish, grave-finds"
12726,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,which he knew so well: and very valuable those illustrations are. But it
12727,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"does not follow, because the one archæologist who has chosen to devote his"
12728,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,knowledge so wholeheartedly to the elucidation of _Beowulf_ was a
12729,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Scandinavian, using Scandinavian material, that therefore _Beowulf_ is"
12730,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Scandinavian. This, however, is the inference which Stjerna himself was apt"
12731,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"to draw, and which is still being drawn from his work. Stjerna speaks of"
12732,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,our poem as a monument raised by the Geatas to the memory of their
12733,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"saga-renowned king[715], though he allows that certain features of the"
12734,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"poem, such as the dragon-fight[716], are of Anglo-Saxon origin."
12735,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
12736,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Of course, it must be allowed that accounts such as those of the fighting"
12737,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"between Swedes and Geatas, if they are historical (and they obviously are),"
12738,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,must have originated from eyewitnesses of the Scandinavian battles: but I
12739,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,doubt if there is anything in _Beowulf_ so purely Scandinavian as to compel
12740,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"us to assume that any line of the story, in the poetical form in which we"
12741,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"now have it, was _necessarily_ composed in Scandinavia. Even if it could be"
12742,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,shown that the conditions depicted in _Beowulf_ can be better illustrated
12743,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"from the grave-finds of Vendel in Sweden than from English diggings, this"
12744,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,would not prove _Beowulf_ Scandinavian. Modern scientific archæology is
12745,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,surely based on chronology as well as geography. The English finds date
12746,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"from {348} the period before 650 A.D., and the Vendel finds from the period"
12747,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,after. _Beowulf_ might well show similarity rather with contemporary art
12748,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,abroad than with the art of earlier generations at home. For intercourse
12749,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,was more general than is always realized. It was not merely trade and
12750,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,plunder which spread fashions from nation to nation. There were the
12751,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"presents of arms which Tacitus mentions as sent, not only privately, but"
12752,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"with public ceremony, from one tribe to another[717]. Similar presentations"
12753,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,are indicated in _Beowulf_[718]; we find them equally at the court of the
12754,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,Ostrogothic Theodoric[719]; Charles the Great sent to Offa of Mercia _unum
12755,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,balteum et unum gladium huniscum_[720]; according to the famous story in
12756,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"the _Heimskringla_, Athelstan sent to Harold Fairhair of Norway a sword and"
12757,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,belt arrayed with gold and silver; Athelstan gave Harold's son Hakon a
12758,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,sword which was the best that ever came to Norway[721]. It is not
12759,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"surprising, then, if we find parallels between English poetry and"
12760,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Scandinavian grave-finds, both apparently dating from about the year 700"
12761,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"A.D. But I do not think that there is any _special_ resemblance, though,"
12762,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"both in _Beowulf_ and in the Vendel graves, there is a profusion lacking in"
12763,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,the case of the simpler Anglo-Saxon tomb-furniture.

12769,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,golden treasure found in the dragon's lair was so bulky that it had to be
12770,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"transported by waggon. And, certainly, gold is found in greater profusion"
12771,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,in Swedish than in English graves: the most casual visitor to the Stockholm
12772,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"museum must be impressed by the magnificence of the exhibits there. But,"
12773,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"granting gold to have been rarer in England than in Sweden, I cannot grant"
12774,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,Stjerna's contention that therefore an English poet could not have
12775,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"conceived the idea of a vast gold hoard[722]; or that, even if the poet"
12776,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,does deck his warriors with gold somewhat more sumptuously than was
12777,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"actually the case in England, {349} we can draw any argument from it. For,"
12778,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"if the dragon in _Beowulf_ guards a treasure, so equally does the typical"
12779,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,dragon of Old English proverbial lore[723]. Beowulf is spoken of as
12780,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"_gold-wlanc_, but the typical thegn in _Finnsburg_ is called"
12781,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,_gold-hladen_[724]. The sword found by Beowulf in the hall of Grendel's
12782,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"mother has a golden hilt, but the English proverb had it that ""gold is in"
12783,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"its place on a man's sword[725]."" Heorot is hung with golden tapestry, but"
12784,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"gold-inwoven fabric has been unearthed from Saxon graves at Taplow, and"
12785,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,elsewhere in England[726]. Gold glitters in other poems quite as lavishly
12786,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"as in _Beowulf_, sometimes more so. Widsith made a hobby of collecting"
12787,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,golden _b[=e]agas_. The subject of _Waldere_ is a fight for treasure. The
12788,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,byrnie of Waldere[727] is adorned with gold: so is that of Holofernes in
12789,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"_Judith_[728], so is that of the typical warrior in the _Elene_[729]. Are"
12790,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,all these poems Scandinavian?

12792,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"""The prevalence of ring-swords."" We know that swords were sometimes fitted"
12793,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,with a ring in the hilt[730]. It is not clear whether the object of this
12794,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"ring was to fasten the hilt by a strap to the wrist, for convenience in"
12795,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,fighting (as has been the custom with the cavalry sword in modern times) or
12796,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"whether it was used to attach the ""peace bands,"" by which the hilt of the"

12798,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"ceremonially[731]. The word _hring-m[=æ]l_, applied three times to the"
12799,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"sword in _Beowulf_, has been interpretated as a reference to these"
12800,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"""ring-swords,"" though it is quite conceivable that it may refer only to the"
12801,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,damascening of the sword with a ringed pattern[732]. Assuming that the
12802,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"reference in _Beowulf_ _is_ to a ""ring-sword,"" Stjerna illustrates the"
12803,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"allusion from seven ring-swords, or fragments of ring-swords, found in"
12804,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Sweden. But, as Dr Clark Hall himself points out (whilst oddly enough"
12805,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,accepting this argument {350} as proof of the Scandinavian colouring of
12806,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,_Beowulf_) four ring-swords at least have been found in England[733]. And
12807,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"these English swords are _real_ ring-swords; that is to say, the pommel is"
12808,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"furnished with a ring, within which another ring moves (in the oldest type"
12809,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"of sword) quite freely. This freedom of movement seems, however, to be"
12810,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"gradually restricted, and in one of these English swords the two rings are"
12811,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"made in one and the same piece. In the Swedish swords, however, this"
12812,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"restriction is carried further, and the two rings are represented by a knob"
12813,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"growing out of a circular base. Another sword of this ""knob""-type has"
12814,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"recently been found in a Frankish tomb[734], and yet another in the"
12815,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,Rhineland[735]. It seems to be agreed among archæologists that the English
12816,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"type, as found in Kent, is the original, and that the Swedish and"
12817,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"continental ""ring-swords"" are merely imitations, in which the ring has"
12818,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"become conventionalized into a knob[736]. But, if so, how can the mention"
12819,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,of a ring-sword in _Beowulf_ (if indeed that be the meaning of
12820,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,_hring-m[=æ]l_) prove Scandinavian colouring? If it proved anything (which
12821,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"it does not) it would tend to prove the reverse, and to locate _Beowulf_ in"
12822,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Kent, where the true ring-swords have been found."
12823,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
12824,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"""The prevalence of boar-helmets."" It is true that several representations"
12825,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,of warriors wearing boar-helmets have been found in Scandinavia. But the
12826,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,only certainly Anglo-Saxon {351} helmet yet found in England has a
12827,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"boar-crest[737]; and this is, I believe, the only actual boar-helmet yet"
12828,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,found. How then can the boar-helmets of _Beowulf_ show Scandinavian rather
12829,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,than Anglo-Saxon origin?
12830,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
12831,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"""The prevalence of ring-corslets."" It is true that only one trace of a"
12832,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"byrnie, and that apparently not of ring-mail, has so far been found in an"
12833,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,Anglo-Saxon grave. (We have somewhat more abundant remains from the period
12834,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"prior to the migration to England: a peculiarly fine corslet of ring-mail,"
12835,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"with remains of some nine others, was found in the moss at Thorsbjerg[738]"
12836,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,in the midst of the ancient Anglian continental home; and other
12837,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"ring-corslets have been found in the neighbourhood of Angel, at Vimose[739]"
12838,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"in Fünen.) But, for the period when _Beowulf_ must have been composed, the"
12839,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,ring-corslet is almost as rare in Scandinavia as in England[740]; the
12840,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"artist, however, seems to be indicating a byrnie upon many of the warriors"
12841,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"depicted on the Vendel helm (Grave 14: seventh century). Equally, in"
12842,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"England, warriors are represented on the Franks Casket as wearing the"
12843,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,byrnie: also the laws of Ine (688-95) make it clear that the byrnie was by
12844,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"no means unknown[741]. Other Old English poems, certainly not Scandinavian,"
12845,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,mention the ring-byrnie. How then can the mention of it in _Beowulf_ be a
12846,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,proof of Scandinavian origin?
12847,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
12848,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"""The prevalence of ring-money."" Before minted money became current, rings"
12849,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"were used everywhere among the Teutonic peoples. Gold rings, _intertwined_"
12850,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"so as to form a chain, have been found throughout Scandinavia, presumably"
12851,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,for use as a medium of exchange. The term _locenra b[=e]aga_ (gen. plu.)
12852,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"occurs in _Beowulf_, and this is interpreted by Stjerna as ""rings"
12853,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"_intertwined or locked_ together[742]."" But _locen_ in _Beowulf_ need not"
12854,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"have the meaning of ""intertwined""; it occurs elsewhere in Old English of a"
12855,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"single jewel, _sincgim locen_[743]. Further, even if _locen_ does mean"
12856,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"{352} ""intertwined,"" such intertwined rings are not limited to Scandinavia"
12857,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,proper. They have been found in Schleswig[744]. And almost the very phrase
12858,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"in _Beowulf_, _londes ne locenra b[=e]aga_[745], recurs in the _Andreas_."

12861,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,the traditional poetic diction: but its occurrence in the _Andreas_ shows
12862,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,that it cannot be used as an argument of Scandinavian origin.

12867,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"which Stjerna has drawn from Scandinavian grave-finds, we must be careful"
12868,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,not to read a Scandinavian colouring into features of _Beowulf_ which are
12869,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"at least as much English as Scandinavian, such as the ring-sword or the"

12874,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,with the wealthy life depicted in _Beowulf_ than does the comparatively
12875,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"meagre tomb-furniture of England. But we must remember that, after the"
12876,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"spread of Christianity in the first half of the seventh century, the custom"
12877,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"of burying articles with the bodies of the dead naturally ceased, or almost"
12878,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"ceased, in England. Scandinavia continued heathen for another four hundred"
12879,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"years, and it was during these years that the most magnificent deposits"
12880,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"were made. As Stjerna himself points out, ""a steadily increasing luxury in"
12881,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"the appointment of graves"" is to be found in Scandinavia in these centuries"
12882,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,before the introduction of Christianity there. When we find in Scandinavia
12883,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"things (complete ships, for example) which we do not find in England, we"
12884,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"owe this, partly to the nature of the soil in which they were embedded, but"
12885,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,also to the continuance of such burial customs after they had died out in
12886,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,England.
12887,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
12888,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
12889,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
12890,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Helm and byrnie were not necessarily unknown, or even very rare in England,"
12891,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,simply because it was not the custom to bury them with the dead. On the
12892,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"other hand, the frequent mention of them in _Beowulf_ does not imply that"
12893,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,they were common: for {353} _Beowulf_ deals only with the aristocratic
12894,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"adherents of a court, and even in _Beowulf_ fine specimens of the helm and"
12895,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,byrnie are spoken of as things which a king seeks far and wide to procure
12896,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"for his retainers[746]. We cannot, therefore, argue that there is any"
12897,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"discrepancy. However, if we do so argue, it would merely prove, not that"
12898,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"_Beowulf_ is Scandinavian as opposed to English, but that it is"
12899,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,comparatively late in date. Tacitus emphasizes the fact that spear and
12900,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"shield were the Teutonic weapons, that helmet and corslet were hardly"
12901,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,known[747]. Pagan graves show that at any rate they were hardly known _as
12902,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"tomb-furniture_ in England in the fifth, sixth, and early seventh"
12903,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"centuries. The introduction of Christianity, and the intercourse with the"
12904,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"South which it involved, certainly led to the growth of pomp and wealth in"
12905,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"England, till the early eighth century became ""the golden age of"
12906,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Anglo-Saxon England."""
12907,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
12908,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,It might therefore conceivably be argued that _Beowulf_ reflects the
12909,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"comparative abundance of early Christian England, as opposed to the more"
12910,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,primitive heathen simplicity; but to argue a Scandinavian origin from the
12911,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,profusion of _Beowulf_ admits of an easy _reductio ad absurdum_. For the
12912,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"same arguments would prove a heathen, Scandinavian origin for the"
12913,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"_Andreas_, the _Elene_, the _Exodus_, or even for the Franks Casket,"
12914,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,despite its Anglo-Saxon inscription and Christian carvings.
12915,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
12916,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
12917,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
12918,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"However, though the absence of helm and byrnie from Anglo-Saxon graves does"
12919,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"not prove that these arms were not used by the living in heathen times, one"
12920,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,thing it assuredly _does_ prove: that the Anglo-Saxons in heathen times did
12921,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,not sacrifice helm and byrnie recklessly in funeral pomp. And this brings
12922,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,us to the second argument as to the origin of _Beowulf_ which has been
12923,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,based on archæology.
12924,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
12925,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,Something has been said above of this second contention[748]--that the
12926,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,accuracy of the account of Beowulf's funeral is confirmed in every point by
12927,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,archæological evidence: that it must {354} therefore have been composed

12934,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,funeral pyres were equipped in England. But we _do_ know how the buried
12935,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,bodies were equipped. And (although inhumation cemeteries are much more
12936,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,common than cremation cemeteries) all the graves that have been opened have
12937,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,so far yielded only one case of a helmet and byrnie being buried with the
12938,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"warrior, and one other very doubtful case of a helmet without the byrnie."
12939,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Abroad, instances are somewhat more common, but still of great rarity. For"
12940,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,such things could ill be spared. Charles the Great forbade the export of
12941,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,byrnies from his dominions. Worn by picked champions fighting in the
12942,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"forefront, they might well decide the issue of a battle. In the mounds"
12943,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"where we have reason to think that the great chiefs mentioned in _Beowulf_,"
12944,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Eadgils or Ohthere, lie buried, any trace of weapons was conspicuously"
12945,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"absent among the burnt remains. Nevertheless, the belief that his armour"
12946,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"would be useful to the champion in the next life, joined perhaps with a"
12947,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"feeling that it was unlucky, or unfair on the part of the survivor to"
12948,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"deprive the dead of his personal weapons, led in heathen times to the"
12949,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,occasional burial of these treasures with the warrior who owned them. The
12950,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"fifth century tomb of Childeric I, when discovered twelve centuries later,"
12951,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,was found magnificently furnished--the prince had been buried with treasure
12952,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"and much equipment[749], sword, scramasax[750], axe, spear. But these were"
12953,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"his own. Similarly, piety might have demanded that Beowulf should be burnt"
12954,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,with his full equipment. But would the pyre have been hung with helmets and
12955,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"byrnies? Whose? Were the thegns asked to sacrifice theirs, and go naked"
12956,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"into the next fight in honour of their lord? If so, what archæological"

13028,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,antiquarian conjecture: but that such is not the case here was proved by
13029,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,the recent discovery that an antiquarian survey (preserved in MS in the
13030,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Royal Library at Stockholm) dating from 1677, mentions in Vendel ""widh"
13031,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Hussby, [en] stor jorde högh, som heeter Otters högen[761]."" An exploration"
13032,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,of Ottar's mound showed a striking similarity with the Uppsala mounds. The

13034,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"{357} cremated remains were similar, there were abundant traces of burnt"

13058,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"character of its hilt[763]."" In this it contrasts with the sword found in"
13059,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"the peat-bogs of Schleswig from an earlier period: ""these swords of the"
13060,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Schleswig moss-finds are much better weapons[764],"" as well as with the"
13061,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"later Viking sword of the ninth or tenth century, which ""is a remarkably"
13062,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"effective and well-considered implement[765]."" It has been suggested that"
13063,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,both the earlier Schleswig swords and the later Viking swords (which bear a
13064,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"considerable likeness to each other, as against the inferior Anglo-Saxon"
13065,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"sword) are the product of intercourse with Romanized peoples[766], whilst"
13066,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"the typical Anglo-Saxon sword ""may represent an independent Germanic effort"
13067,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"at sword making[767]."" However this may be, it is noteworthy that nowhere"

13069,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"regarded as contemporary. A good sword is always ""an old heirloom,"" ""an"
13070,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"ancient treasure[768]."" The sword of Wiglaf, which had belonged to Eanmund,"
13071,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"or the sword with which Eofor slays Ongentheow, are {358} described by the"
13072,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"phrase _ealdsweord eotenisc_, as if they were weapons of which the secret"
13073,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,and origin had been lost--indeed the same phrase is applied to the magic
13074,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,sword which Beowulf finds in the hall of Grendel's mother.
13075,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
13076,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,The blade of these ancestral swords was sometimes damascened or adorned
13077,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,with wave-like patterns[769]. The swords of the Schleswig moss-finds are
13078,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"almost all thus adorned with a variegated surface, as often are the later"
13079,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,Viking swords; but those of the Anglo-Saxon graves are _not_. Is it
13080,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,fanciful to suggest that the reference to damascening is a tradition coming
13081,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,down from the time of the earlier sword as found in the Nydam moss? A few

13091,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
13092,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,THE HELMET. The helmet found at Benty Grange in Derbyshire in 1848 is now
13093,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"in the Sheffield Museum[770]: little remains except the boar-crest, the"
13094,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"nose-piece, and the framework of iron ribs radiating from the crown, and"
13095,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,fixed to a circle of iron surrounding the brow (perhaps the
13096,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"_fr[=e]awr[=a]sn_ of _Beowulf_, 1451). Mr Bateman, the discoverer,"
13097,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"described the helmet as ""coated with narrow plates of horn, running in a"
13098,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"diagonal direction from the ribs, so as to form a herring-bone pattern; the"
13099,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"ends were secured by strips of horn, radiating in like manner as the iron"
13100,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"ribs, to which they were riveted at intervals of about an inch and a half:"
13101,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"all the rivets had ornamented heads of silver on the outside, and on the"
13102,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,front rib is a small cross of the same metal. Upon the top or crown of the
13103,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"helmet, is an elongated oval brass plate, upon which stands the figure of"
13104,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"an animal, carved in iron, now much rusted, but still a very good"
13105,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"representation of a pig: it has bronze eyes[771]."" Helmets of very similar"
13106,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"construction, but without the boar, have been found on the Continent and in"
13107,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Scandinavia (Vendel, Grave 14, late seventh century). The continental"
13108,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,helmets often {359} stand higher[772] than the Benty Grange or Vendel
13109,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"specimens, being sometimes quite conical (cf. the epithet ""war-steep,"""
13110,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"_heaðo-st[=e]ap_, _Beowulf_). Many of the continental helmets are provided"
13111,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"with cheek-protections, and these also appear in the Scandinavian"
13112,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,representations of warriors on the Torslunda plates and elsewhere. These
13113,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"side pieces have become detached from the magnificent Vendel helmet, which"
13114,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"is often shown in engravings without them[773], but they can be seen in the"
13115,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Stockholm Museum[774]. If it ever possessed them, the Benty Grange helmet"
13116,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"has lost these side pieces. Such cheek-protections are, however,"
13117,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"represented, together with the nose-protection, on the head of one of the"
13118,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"warriors depicted on the Franks Casket. In the Vendel helms, the"
13119,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"nose-pieces were connected under the eyes with the rim of the helmet, so as"
13120,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,to form a mask[774]; the helmet in _Beowulf_ is frequently spoken of as the
13121,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,battle-mask[775].

13151,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,THE SPEAR. Spear and shield were the essential Germanic weapons in the days
13152,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"of Tacitus, and they are the weapons most commonly found in Old English"
13153,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"tombs. The spear-shaft has generally decayed, analysis of fragments"
13154,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,surviving show that it was frequently of ash[784]. The butt-end of the
13155,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"spear was frequently furnished with an iron tip, and the distance of this"
13156,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"from the spear-head, and the size of the socket, show the spear-shaft to"
13157,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"have been six or seven feet long, and three-quarters of an inch to one inch"
13158,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,in diameter.

13162,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"THE SHIELD. Several round shields were preserved on the Gokstad ship, and"
13163,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,in the deposits of an earlier period at Thorsbjerg and Nydam. These are
13164,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"formed of boards fastened together, often only a quarter of an inch thick,"
13165,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"and not strengthened or braced in any way, bearing out the contemptuous"
13166,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,description of the painted German shield which Tacitus puts into the mouth
13167,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"of Germanicus[785]. It was, however, intended that the shield should be"
13168,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"light. It was easily pierced, but, by a rapid twist, the foe's sword could"
13169,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,be broken or wrenched from his hand. Thus we are told how Gunnar gave his
13170,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"shield a twist, as his adversary thrust his sword through it, and so"
13171,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"snapped off his sword at the hilt[786]. The shield was held by a bar,"
13172,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,crossing a hole some four inches wide cut in the middle. The hand was
13173,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"protected by a hollow conical boss or umbo, fixed to the wood by its brim,"
13174,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,but projecting considerably. In England the wood of the shield has always
13175,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"perished, but a large number of bosses have been preserved. The boss seems"
13176,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"to have been called _rond_, a word which is also used for the shield as a"
13177,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"whole. In _Beowulf_, 2673, _Gifts of Men_, 65, the meaning ""boss"" suits"
13178,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"_rond_ best, also in _rand sceal on scylde, fæst fingra gebeorh_ (_Cotton."
13179,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Gnomic Verses_, 37-8). But the original meaning of _rand_ must have been"

13187,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
13188,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,THE BOW is a weapon of much less importance in _Beowulf_ than the spear.
13189,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Few traces of the bow have survived from Anglo-Saxon England, though many"
13190,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,wooden long-bows have been preserved in the moss-finds in a remarkably fine
13191,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"state. They are of yew, some over six feet long, and in at least one"
13192,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"instance tipped with horn. The bow entirely of horn was, of course, well"
13193,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"known in the East, and in classical antiquity, but I do not think traces of"
13194,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,any horn-bow have been discovered in the North. It was a difficult weapon
13195,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"to manage, as the suitors of Penelope found to their cost. Possibly that is"
13196,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,why Hæthcyn is represented as killing his brother Herebeald accidentally
13197,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,with a horn-bow: he could not manage the exotic weapon.

13202,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,

13205,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"the Mohammedan invasion. But, even if this surmise[787] be correct, the"
13206,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,structure of a stone hall of about 750 A.D. gives us little information as
13207,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,to the wooden halls of early Anglo-Saxon times. Heorot is clearly built of
13208,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"timber, held together by iron clamps[788]. These halls were oblong, and a"
13209,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"famous passage in Bede[789] makes it clear that, at any rate at the time of"
13210,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"the Conversion, the hall had a door at both ends, and the fire burnt in the"
13211,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"middle. (The smoke escaped through a hole in the roof, through which"
13212,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"probably most of the light came, for windows were few or none.) The"
13213,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,_Finnsburg Fragment_ also implies two doors. Further indications can be
13214,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,drawn from references to the halls of Norse chiefs. The Scandinavian hall
13215,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,was divided by rows of wooden pillars into a central nave and side aisles.
13216,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"The pillars in the centre were known as the ""high-seat pillars."" Rows of"
13217,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"seats ran down the length of the hall on each side. The central position,"
13218,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"facing the high-seat pillars and the fire, was the most honourable. The"
13219,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,place of honour for the chief guest was opposite: and it is quite clear
13220,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,that in _Beowulf_ also the guest did not sit next his host[790].
13221,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,
13222,F. _BEOWULF_ AND THE ARCHÆOLOGISTS,"Other points we may note about Heorot, are the tapestry with which its"

13402,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,The obvious interpretation of the name _B[=e]owulf_ is that suggested by
13403,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Grimm[806], that it means ""wolf, or foe, of the bee."" Grimm's suggestion"
13404,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"was repeated independently by Skeat[807], and further reasons for the"
13405,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"interpretation ""bee-foe"" have been found by Sweet[808] (who had been"
13406,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"anticipated by Simrock[809] in some of his points), by Cosijn[810],"
13407,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Sievers[811], von Grienberger[812], Panzer[813] and Björkman[814]."
13408,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13409,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"From the phonological point of view the etymology is a {366} perfect one,"
13410,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"but many of those who were convinced that ""Beowulf"" meant ""bee-foe"" had no"
13411,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"satisfactory explanation of ""bee-foe"" to offer[815]. Others, like Bugge,"
13412,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"whilst admitting that, so far as the form of the words goes, the etymology"
13413,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"is satisfactory, rejected ""bee-foe"" because it seemed to them"
13414,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,meaningless[816].
13415,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13416,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Yet it is very far from meaningless. ""Bee-foe"" means ""bear."" The bear has"
13417,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"got a name, or nickname, in many northern languages from his habit of"
13418,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,raiding the hives for honey. The Finnish name for bear is said to be
13419,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"""honey-hand"": he is certainly called ""sweet-foot,"" _sötfot_, in Sweden, and"
13420,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the Old Slavonic name, ""honey-eater,"" has come to be accepted in Russian,"
13421,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"not merely as a nickname, but as the regular term for ""bear."""
13422,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13423,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"And ""bear"" is an excellent name for a hero of story. The O.E. _beorn_,"
13424,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"""warrior, hero, prince"" seems originally to have meant simply ""bear."" The"
13425,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"bear, says Grimm, ""is regarded, in the belief of the Old Norse, Slavonic,"
13426,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Finnish and Lapp peoples, as an exalted and holy being, endowed with human"
13427,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"understanding and the strength of twelve men. He is called 'forest-king,'"
13428,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"'gold-foot,' 'sweet-foot,' 'honey-hand,' 'honey-paw,' 'honey-eater,' but"
13429,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"also 'the great,' 'the old,' 'the old grandsire[817].'"" ""Bee-hunter"" is"
13430,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,then a satisfactory explanation of _B[=e]owulf_: while the alternative
13431,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,explanations are none of them satisfactory.
13432,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13433,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,Many scholars have been led off the track by the assumption that Beow and
13434,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Beowulf are to be identified, and that we must therefore assume that the"
13435,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,first element in Beowulf's name is _B[=e]ow_--that we must divide not
13436,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"_B[=e]o-wulf_ but _B[=e]ow-ulf_, ""a warrior after the manner of Beow[818]."""
13437,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,But there is no ground {367} for any such assumption. It is true that in
13438,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"ll. 18, 53, ""Beowulf"" is written where we should have expected ""Beowa."""
13439,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"But, even if two words of similar sound have been confused, this fact"
13440,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,affords no reason for supposing that they must necessarily have been in the
13441,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"first instance connected etymologically. And against the ""warrior of Beow"""
13442,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,interpretation is the fact that the name is recorded in the early
13443,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Northumbrian _Liber Vitae_ under the form ""Biuuulf[819]."" This name, which"
13444,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"is that of an early monk of Durham, is presumably the same as that of the"
13445,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"hero of our poem, though it does not, of course, follow that the bearer of"
13446,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,it was named with any special reference to the slayer of Grendel. Now
13447,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"_Biuuulf_ is correct Northumbrian for ""bee-wolf,"" but the first element in"
13448,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the word cannot stand for _B[=e]ow_[820], unless the {368} affinities and"
13449,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,forms of that word are quite different from all that the evidence has
13450,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"hitherto led us to believe. So much at least seems certain. Besides, we"
13451,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,have seen that Byggvir is taunted by Loki precisely with the fact that he
13452,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,_is_ no warrior. If we can estimate the characteristics of the O.E. Beow
13453,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"from those of the Scandinavian Byggvir, the name ""Warrior after the manner"
13454,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"of Beow"" would be meaningless, if not absurd. Bugge[821], relying upon the"
13455,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"parallel O.N. form _Bjólfr_[822], which is recorded as the name of one of"
13456,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the early settlers in Iceland[823], tried to interpret the word as"
13457,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"_Boejólfr_ ""the wolf of the farmstead,"" quoting as parallels _Heimulf_,"
13458,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"_Gardulf_. But _Bjólfr_ itself is best interpreted as ""Bee-wolf[824]."" And"
13459,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"admittedly Bugge's explanation does not suit the O.E. _B[=e]owulf_, and"
13460,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,necessitates the assumption that the word in English is a mere meaningless
13461,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,borrowing from the Scandinavian: for _B[=e]owulf_ assuredly does not mean
13462,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"""wolf of the farmstead[825]."""
13463,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13464,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,Neither can we take very seriously the explanation of Sarrazin and
13465,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Ferguson[826] that _B[=e]owulf_ is an abbreviation of _Beadu-wulf_, ""wolf"
13466,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"of war."" Our business is to interpret the name _B[=e]owulf_, or, if we"
13467,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"cannot, to admit that we cannot; not to substitute some quite distinct name"
13468,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"for it, and interpret that. Such theories merely show to what straits we"
13469,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"may be reduced, if we reject the obvious etymology of the word."
13470,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13471,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"And there are two further considerations, which confirm, almost to a"
13472,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"certainty, this obvious interpretation of ""Beowulf"" as ""Bee-wolf"" or"
13473,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"""Bear."" The first is that it agrees excellently with Beowulf's bear-like"
13474,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,habit of hugging his adversaries to death--a feature which surely belongs
13475,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"to the original kernel of our story, since it is incompatible with the"
13476,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"chivalrous, {369} weapon-loving trappings in which that story has been"
13477,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"dressed[827]. The second is that, as I have tried to show, the evidence is"
13478,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,strongly in favour of Bjarki and Beowulf being originally the same
13479,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,figure[828]: and Bjarki is certainly a bear-hero[829]. His name signifies
13480,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"as much, and in the _Saga of Rolf Kraki_ we are told at length how the"
13481,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,father of Bjarki was a prince who had been turned by enchantment into a
13482,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,bear[830].
13483,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13484,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13485,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13486,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"If, then, Beowulf is a bear-hero[831], the next step is to enquire whether"
13487,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,there is any real likeness between his adventures at Heorot and under the
13488,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"mere, and the adventures of the hero of the widely-spread ""Bear's Son"""
13489,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"folk-tale. This investigation has, as we have seen above[832], been carried"
13490,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"out by Panzer in his monumental work, which marks an epoch in the study of"
13491,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,_Beowulf_.
13492,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13493,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Panzer's arguments in favour of such connection would, I think, have been"
13494,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,strengthened if he had either quoted textually a number of the more
13495,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"important and less generally accessible folk-tales, or, since this would"
13496,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"have proved cumbersome, if he had at least given abstracts of them. The"
13497,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"method which Panzer follows, is to enumerate over two hundred tales, and"
13498,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,from them to construct a story which is a compound of them all. This is
13499,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"obviously a method which is liable to abuse, though I do not say that"
13500,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,Panzer has abused it. But we must not let a story so constructed usurp in
13501,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"our minds the place of the actual recorded folk-tales. Folk-tales, as"
13502,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Andrew Lang wrote long ago, ""consist of but few incidents, grouped together"
13503,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"in a kaleidoscopic variety of arrangements."" A collection of over two"
13504,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,hundred cognate tales offers a wide field for the selection therefrom of a
13505,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"composite story. Further, some geographical discrimination is necessary:"
13506,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"these tales are scattered over Europe and Asia, and it is important to keep"
13507,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"constantly in mind whether a given type of tale belongs, for example, to"
13508,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,Greece or to Scandinavia.

13511,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13512,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,A typical example of the Bear's son tale is _Der Starke Hans_ in
13513,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,Grimm[833]. Hans is brought up in a robber's den: but quite apart from any
13514,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"of the theories we are now considering, it has long been recognized that"
13515,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"this is a mere toning down of the original incredible story, which makes a"
13516,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,bear's den the nursery of the strong youth[834]. Hans overcomes in an empty
13517,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,castle the foe (a mannikin of magic powers) who has already worsted his
13518,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"comrades Fir-twister and Stone-splitter. He pursues this foe to his hole,"
13519,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"is let down by his companions in a basket by a rope, slays the foe with his"
13520,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,club and rescues a princess. He sends up the princess in the basket; but
13521,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,when his own turn comes to be pulled up his associates intentionally drop
13522,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the basket when halfway up. But Hans, suspecting treason, has only sent up"
13523,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"his club. He escapes by magic help, takes vengeance on the traitors, and"
13524,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,weds the princess.
13525,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13526,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"In another story in Grimm[835], the antagonist whom the hero overcomes, but"
13527,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"does not in this case slay, is called the Earthman, _Dat Erdmänneken_. This"
13528,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"type begins with the disappearance of the princesses, who are to the"
13529,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,orthodox number of three; otherwise it does not differ materially from the
13530,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"abstract given above. Grimm records four distinct versions, all from"
13531,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,Western Germany.
13532,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13533,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,The versions of this widespread story which are most easily accessible to
13534,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,English readers are likely to prejudice such readers against Panzer's view.
13535,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"The two versions in Campbell's _Popular Tales of the West Highlands_[836],"
13536,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,or the version in Kennedy's _Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts_[837]

13538,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"or of the _Grettir_-story either. Indeed, I believe that from countries so"
13539,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,remote as North Italy or Russia parallels can be found which are closer
13540,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,than any so far quoted from the Celtic portions of the British Isles.

13575,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,half his kingdom to whomsoever will destroy the beast. The youngest prince
13576,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"of three watches, {372} after the failure of his two elder brothers, chases"
13577,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"and wounds the monster, who in the end pulls up a stone and disappears into"
13578,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the earth. The prince is let down by his brothers, and, with the help of a"
13579,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"sword specially given him in the underworld, and a draught of the water of"
13580,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"strength, he slays the foe, and wins the princesses. In order to have these"
13581,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"for themselves, the elder brothers drop what they suppose to be their"
13582,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"youngest brother, as they are drawing him up: but it is only a stone he has"
13583,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,cautiously tied to the rope in place of himself. The prince's miraculous
13584,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"return in disguise, his feats, recognition by the youngest princess, the"
13585,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"exposure of the traitors, and marriage of the hero, all follow in due"
13586,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,course[846].
13587,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13588,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"A closer Russian parallel is that of _Ivashko Medvedko_[847]. ""John"
13589,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Honey-eater"" or ""Bear."" John grows up, not by years, but by hours: nearly"
13590,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"every hour he gains an inch in height. At fifteen, there are complaints of"
13591,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"his rough play with other village boys, and John Bear has to go out into"
13592,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the world, after his grandfather has provided him with a weapon, an iron"
13593,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,staff of immense weight. He meets a champion who is drinking up a river:
13594,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"""Good morning, John Bear, whither art going?"" ""I know not whither; I just"
13595,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"go, not knowing where to go."" ""If so, take me with you."" The same happens"
13596,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"with a second champion whose hobby is to carry mountains on his shoulder,"
13597,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"and with a third, who plucks up oaks or pushes them into the ground. They"
13598,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"come to a revolving house in a dark forest, which at John's word stands"
13599,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,with its back door to the forest and its front door to them: all its doors
13600,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"and windows open of their own accord. Though the yard is full of poultry,"
13601,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the house is empty. Whilst the three companions go hunting, the"
13602,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"river-swallower stays in the house to cook dinner: this done, he washes his"
13603,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"head, and sits at the window to comb his locks. Suddenly the earth shakes,"
13604,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"then stands still: a stone is lifted, and from under it appears Baba Yaga"
13605,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,driving in her mortar with a pestle: behind her comes barking a little dog.
13606,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"A short dialogue ensues, and the champion, at her request, gives her food;"
13607,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"but the second helping she throws to her dog, and thereupon beats the"
13608,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,champion with {373} her pestle till he becomes unconscious; then she cuts a
13609,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"strip of skin from his back, and after eating all the food, vanishes. The"
13610,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"victim recovers his senses, ties up his head with a handkerchief, and, when"
13611,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"his companions return, apologizes for the ill-success of his cooking: ""He"
13612,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"had been nearly suffocated by the fumes of the charcoal, and had had his"
13613,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"work cut out to get the room clear."" Exactly the same happens to the other"
13614,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"champions. On the fourth day it is the turn of John Bear, and here again"
13615,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the same formulas are repeated. John does the cooking, washes his head,"
13616,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,sits down at the window and begins to comb his curly locks. Baba Yaga
13617,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"appears with the usual phenomena, and the usual dialogue follows, till she"
13618,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"begins to belabour the hero with her pestle. But he wrests it from her,"
13619,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"beats her almost to death, cuts three strips from her skin, and imprisons"
13620,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"her in a closet. When his companions return, they are astonished to find"
13621,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"dinner ready. After dinner they have a bath, and the companions try not to"
13622,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"show their mutilated backs, but at last have to confess. ""Now I see why you"
13623,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"all suffered from suffocation,"" says John Bear. He goes to the closet,"
13624,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"takes the three strips cut from his friends, and reinserts them: they heal"
13625,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"at once. Then he ties up Baba Yaga by a cord fastened to one foot, and they"
13626,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"all shoot at the cord in turn. John Bear hits it, and cuts the string in"
13627,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"two; Baba Yaga falls to the earth, but rises, runs to the stone from under"
13628,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"which she had appeared, lifts it, and vanishes. Each of the companions"
13629,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"tries in turn to lift the stone, but only John can accomplish it, and only"
13630,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"he is willing to go down. His comrades let him down by a rope, which"
13631,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"however is too short, and John has to eke it out by the three strips"
13632,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"previously cut from the back of Baba Yaga. At the bottom he sees a path,"
13633,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"follows it, and reaches a palace where are three beautiful maidens, who"
13634,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"welcome him, but warn him against their mother, who is Baba Yaga herself:"
13635,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"""She is asleep now, but she keeps at her head a sword. Do not touch it, but"
13636,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"take two golden apples lying on a silver tray, wake her gently, and offer"
13637,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"them to her. As soon as she begins to eat, seize the sword, and cut her"
13638,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"head off at one blow."" John Bear carries out these instructions, and sends"
13639,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"up the maidens, two to be wives to his companions, and the youngest to be"
13640,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"his own wife. This leaves the third companion wifeless {374} and, in"
13641,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"indignation, he cuts the rope when the turn comes to pull John up. The hero"
13642,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"falls and is badly hurt. [John has forgotten, in this version, to put his"
13643,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,iron club into the basket instead of himself--indeed he has up to now made
13644,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"no use of his staff.] In time the hero sees an underground passage, and"
13645,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"makes his way out into the white world. Here he finds the youngest maiden,"
13646,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"who is tending cattle, after refusing to marry the false companion. John"
13647,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Bear follows her home, slays his former comrades with his staff, and throws"
13648,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,their bodies on the field for the wild beasts to devour. He then takes his
13649,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"sweetheart home to his people, and weds her."
13650,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13651,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"The abstract given above is from a translation made by one of my students,"
13652,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Miss M. Steine, who tells me that she had heard the tale in this form many"
13653,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"times from her old nurse ""when we were being sent to sleep, or sitting"
13654,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"round her in the evening."" I have given it at this length because I do not"
13655,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,know of any accessible translation into any Western language.
13656,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13657,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,Panzer enumerates two hundred and two variants of the story: and there are
13658,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,others[848]. But there is reason in the criticism that what is important
13659,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,for us is the form the folk-tale may have taken in those countries where we
13660,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,must look for the original home of the _Beowulf_-story[849]. The Mantuan
13661,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,folk-tale may have been carried down to North Italy from Scandinavia by the
13662,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,Longobards: who can say? But Panzer's theory must stand or fall by the
13663,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,parallels which can be drawn between the _Beowulf-Grettir_-story on the one
13664,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"hand, and the folk-tales as they have been collected in the countries where"
13665,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"this story is native: the lands, that is to say, adjoining the North Sea."
13666,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13667,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,Now it is precisely here that we do find the most remarkable resemblances:
13668,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"in Iceland, the Faroes, Norway, Denmark, Jutland, Schleswig, and the Low"
13669,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,German lands as far as the Scheldt.
13670,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13671,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,An Icelandic version exists in an unprinted MS at Reykjavik[850] which can
13672,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"be consulted in a German translation[851]. In this {375} version a bear,"
13673,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"who is really an enchanted prince, carries off a princess. He resumes his"
13674,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"human form and weds the princess, but must still at times take the bear's"
13675,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"form. His child, the Bear-boy (Bjarndreingur), is to be kept in the house"
13676,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,during the long periods when the enchanted husband is away. But at twelve
13677,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"years old the Bear-boy is too strong and unmanageable, bursts out, and"
13678,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"slays a bear who turns out to be his father. His mother's heart is broken,"
13679,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"but Bear-boy goes on his adventures, and associates with himself three"
13680,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"companions, one of whom is Stein. They build a house in the wood, which is"
13681,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"attacked by a giant, and, as usual, the companions are unable to withstand"
13682,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the attacks. Bear-boy does so, ties the giant's hands behind his back, and"
13683,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,fastens him by his beard. But the giant tears himself free. As in
13684,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"_Beowulf_, Bear-boy and his companions follow the track by the drops of"
13685,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"blood, and come to a hole. Stein is let some way down, the other companions"
13686,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"further, but only Bear-boy dares to go to the bottom. There he finds a"
13687,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"weeping princess, and learns that she, and her two sisters, have been"
13688,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"carried off by three giants, one of whom is his former assailant. He slays"
13689,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"all three, and sends their heads up, together with the maidens and other"
13690,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"treasures. But his companions desert the rope, and he has to climb up"
13691,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,unaided. In the end he weds the youngest princess.
13692,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13693,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,The story from the Faroe Islands runs thus:
13694,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13695,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Three brothers lived together and took turns, two to go out fishing, and"
13696,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"one to be at home. For two days, when the two elder brothers were at home,"
13697,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,came a giant with a long beard (Skeggjatussi) and ate and drank all the
13698,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"food. Then comes the turn of the despised youngest brother, who is called"
13699,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"in one version Øskudólgur--""the one who sits and rakes in the ashes""--a"
13700,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"kind of male Cinderella. This brother routs the giant, either by catching"
13701,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"his long beard in a cleft tree-trunk, or by branding him in the nose with a"
13702,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,hot iron. In either case the mutilated giant escapes down a hole: in one
13703,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"version, after the other brothers come home, they follow him to this hole"
13704,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,by the track of his blood. The two elder brothers leave the task of
13705,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"plunging down to the youngest one, who finds below a girl (in the second"
13706,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"version, two kidnapped princesses). He finds also a magic sword hanging"
13707,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"{376} on the wall, which he is only able to lift when he has drunk a magic"
13708,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"potion. He then slays the giant, rescues the maiden or maidens, is betrayed"
13709,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,in the usual way by his brothers: in the one version they deliberately
13710,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,refuse to draw him up: in the other they cut the rope as they are doing so:
13711,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"but he is discreetly sending up only a big stone. The hero is helped out,"
13712,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"however, by a giant, ""Skræddi Kjálki"" or ""Snerkti risi,"" and in the end"
13713,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,marries the princess[852].
13714,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13715,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,In the Norwegian folk-tale the three adventurers are called respectively
13716,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the Captain, the Lieutenant and the Soldier. They search for the three"
13717,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"princesses, and watch in a castle, where the Captain and Lieutenant are in"
13718,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,turn worsted by a strange visitor--who in this version is not identical
13719,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,with the troll below ground who guards the princesses[853]. When the turn
13720,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"of the Soldier comes, he seizes the intruder (the man, as he is called)."
13721,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13722,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"""Ah no, Ah no, spare my life,"" said the man, ""and you shall know all."
13723,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"East of the castle is a great sandheap, and down in it a winch, with"
13724,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"which you can lower yourself. But if you are afraid, and do not dare to"
13725,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"go right down, you only need to pull the bell rope which you will find"
13726,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"there, and up you will come again. But if you dare venture so far as to"
13727,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"come to the bottom, there stands a flask on a shelf over the door: you"
13728,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,must drink what is in it: so will you become so strong that you can
13729,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,strike the head off the troll of the mountain. And by the door there
13730,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"hangs a Troll-sword, which also you must take, for no other steel will"
13731,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"bite on his body."""
13732,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13733,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"When he had learnt this, he let the man go. When the Captain and the"
13734,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Lieutenant came home, they were not a little surprised to find the"
13735,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Soldier alive. ""How have you escaped a drubbing,"" said they, ""has not"
13736,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the man been {377} here?"" ""Oh yes, he is quite a good fellow, he is,"""
13737,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"said the Soldier, ""I have learnt from him where the princesses are,"""
13738,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"and he told them all. They were glad when they heard that, and when"
13739,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"they had eaten, they went all three to the sandheap."
13740,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13741,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"As usual, the Captain and the Lieutenant do not dare to go to the bottom:"
13742,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the hero accomplishes the adventure, is (as usual) betrayed by his"
13743,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"comrades, but is saved because he has put a stone in the basket instead of"
13744,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"himself, and in the end is rescued by the interposition of ""Kløverhans."""
13745,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13746,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"What is the explanation of the ""sandheap"" (_sandhaug_) I do not know. But"
13747,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"one cannot forget that Grettir's adventure in the house, followed by his"
13748,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"adventure with the troll under the earth, is localized at Sandhaugar. This"
13749,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,may be a mere accident; but it is worth noting that in following up the
13750,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,track indicated by Panzer we come across startling coincidences of this
13751,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"kind. As stated above, it can hardly be due to any influence of the"
13752,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,_Grettis Saga_ upon the folk-tale[854]. The likeness between the two is too
13753,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,remote to have suggested a transference of such details from the one story
13754,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,to the other.
13755,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13756,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"We find the story in its normal form in Jutland[855]. The hero, a"
13757,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"foundling, is named Bjørnøre (Bear-ears). There is no explanation offered"
13758,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"of this name, but we know that in other versions of the story, where the"
13759,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"hero is half bear and half man, his bear nature is shown by his bear's"
13760,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"ears. ""Bear-ears"" comes with his companions to an empty house, worsts the"
13761,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"foe (the old man, _den gamle_) who has put his companions to shame, and"
13762,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,fixes him by his beard in a cloven tree. The foe escapes nevertheless; they
13763,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"follow him to his hole: the companions are afraid, but ""Bear-ears"" is let"
13764,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"down, finds the enemy on his bed, and slays him. The rest of the story"
13765,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"follows the usual pattern. ""Bear-ears"" rescues and sends up the princesses,"
13766,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"his comrades detach the rope, which however is hauling up only the hero's"
13767,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"iron club. He escapes miraculously from his confinement below, and returns"
13768,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"to marry the youngest princess. In another Danish version, from the South"
13769,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"of Zealand[856], the hero, ""Strong Hans"" (nothing is said {378} about his"
13770,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"bear-origin), comes with his companions to a magnificent but empty castle."
13771,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,The old witch worsts his comrades and imprisons them under the trap-door:
13772,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"but Hans beats her and rescues them, though the witch herself escapes. Hans"
13773,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"is let down, rescues the princesses, is betrayed by his comrades (who,"
13774,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"thinking to drop him in drawing him up, only drop his iron club), and"
13775,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,finally weds the third princess.
13776,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13777,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,A little further South we have three versions of the same tale recorded for
13778,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Schleswig-Holstein[857]. The hero wins his victory below by means of ""a"
13779,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"great iron sword"" (_en grotes ysernes Schwäert_) which he can only wield"
13780,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,after drinking of the magic potion.
13781,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13782,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"From Hanover comes the story of Peter Bär[858], which shows all the"
13783,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,familiar features: from the same district came some of Grimm's variants.
13784,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,Others were from the Rhine provinces: but the fullest version of all comes
13785,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"from the Scheldt, just over the Flemish border. The hero, Jean l'Ourson, is"
13786,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"recovered as a child from a bear's den, is despised in his youth[859], but"
13787,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,gives early proof of his strength. He defends an empty castle _un superbe
13788,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"château_, when his companion has failed, strikes off an arm[860] of his"
13789,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"assailant _Petit-Père-Bidoux_, chases him to his hole, _un puits vaste et"
13790,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"profond_. He is let down by his companion, but finding the rope too short,"
13791,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"plunges, and arrives battered at the bottom. There he perceives _une"
13792,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,lumière qui brillait au bout d'une longue galerie_[861]. At the end of the
13793,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"gallery he sees his former assailant, attended by _une vieille femme à"
13794,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"cheveux blancs, qui semblait âgée de plus de cent ans_, who is salving his"
13795,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,wounded arm. The hero quenches the light (which is a magic one) smites his
13796,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"foe on the head and kills him, and then rekindles the lamp[862]. His"
13797,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"companion above seeks to rob him of the two princesses he has won, by"
13798,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"detaching the rope. Nevertheless, he escapes, weds the good princess, and"
13799,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,punishes his faithless companion by making him wed the bad one.
13800,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13801,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,The white-haired old woman is not spoken of as the mother {379} of the foe
13802,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"she is nursing, and it may be doubted whether she is in any way parallel to"
13803,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Grendel's mother. The hero does not fight her: indeed it is she who, in the"
13804,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"end, enables him to escape. Still the parallels between Jean l'Ourson and"
13805,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Beowulf are striking enough. Nine distinct features recur, in the same"
13806,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"order, in the _Beowulf_-story and in this folk-tale. It needs a more robust"
13807,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,faith than I possess to attribute this solely to chance.
13808,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13809,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Unfortunately, this French-Flemish tale is found in a somewhat"
13810,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"sophisticated collection. Its recorder, as Sainte-Beuve points out in his"
13811,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"letter introductory to the series[863], uses literary touches which"
13812,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,diminish the value of his folk-tales to the student of origins. Any
13813,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,contamination from the _Beowulf_-story or the _Grettir_-story is surely
13814,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"improbable enough in this case: nevertheless, one would have liked the tale"
13815,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,taken down verbatim from the lips of some simple-minded narrator as it used
13816,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,to be told at Condé on the Scheldt.
13817,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13818,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13819,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13820,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"But if we take together the different versions enumerated above, the result"
13821,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"is, I think, convincing. Here are eight versions of one folk-tale taken as"
13822,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,representatives from a much larger number current in the countries in touch
13823,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"with the North Sea: from Iceland, the Faroes, Norway, Jutland, Zealand,"
13824,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Schleswig, Hanover, and the Scheldt. The champion is a bear-hero (as"
13825,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Beowulf almost certainly is, and as Bjarki quite certainly is); he is"
13826,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"called, in Iceland, _Bjarndreingur_, in Jutland, _Bjørnøre_, in Hanover,"
13827,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"_Peter Bär_, on the Scheldt _Jean l'Ourson_. Like Beowulf, he is despised"
13828,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"in his youth (Faroe, Scheldt). In all versions he resists his adversary in"
13829,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"an empty house or castle, after his comrades have failed. In most versions"
13830,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"of the folk-tale this is the third attack, as it is in the case of Grettir"
13831,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"at Sandhaugar and of Bjarki: in _Beowulf_, on the contrary, we gather that"
13832,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"Heorot has been raided many times. The adversary, though vanquished,"
13833,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,escapes; in one version after the loss of an arm (Scheldt): they follow his
13834,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"track to the hole into which he has vanished, sometimes, as in _Beowulf_,"
13835,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"marking traces of his blood (Iceland, Faroe, Schleswig). The hero always"
13836,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"ventures down alone, and gets into {380} an underworld of magic, which has"
13837,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,left traces of its mysteriousness in _Beowulf_. In one tale (Scheldt) the
13838,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"hero sees a magic lamp burning below, just as he sees the fire in _Beowulf_"
13839,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"or the _Grettis Saga_. He overcomes either his original foe, or new ones,"
13840,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"often by the use of a magic sword (Faroe, Norway, Schleswig); this sword"
13841,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,hangs by the door (Norway) or on the wall (Faroe) as in _Beowulf_. After
13842,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"slaying his foe, the hero rekindles the magic lamp, in the Scheldt fairy"
13843,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"tale, just as he kindles a light in the _Grettis Saga_, and as the light"
13844,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,flashes up in _Beowulf_ after the hero has smitten Grendel's mother. The
13845,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"hero is in each case deserted by his companions: a feature which, while it"
13846,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"is marked in the _Grettis Saga_, can obviously be allowed to survive in"
13847,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,_Beowulf_ only in a much softened form. The chosen retainers whom Beowulf
13848,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"has taken with him on his journey could not be represented as unfaithful,"
13849,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,because the poet is reserving the episode of the faithless retainers for
13850,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,the death of Beowulf. To have twice represented the escort as cowardly
13851,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"would have made the poem a satire upon the _comitatus_, and would have"
13852,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,assured it a hostile reception in every hall from Canterbury to Edinburgh.
13853,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,But there is no doubt as to the faithlessness of the comrade Stein in the
13854,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"_Grettis Saga_. And in Zealand, one of the faithless companions is called"
13855,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"_Stenhuggeren_ (the Stone-hewer), in Schleswig _Steenklöwer_, in Hanover"
13856,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"_Steinspieler_, whilst in Iceland he has the same name, _Stein_, which he"
13857,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,has in the _Grettis Saga_.
13858,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13859,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,The fact that the departure home of the Danes in _Beowulf_ is due to the
13860,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"same cause as that which accounts for the betrayal of his trust by Stein,"
13861,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,shows that in the original _Beowulf_-story also this feature must have
13862,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"occurred, however much it may have become worn down in the existing epic."
13863,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13864,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,I think enough has been said to show that there is a real likeness between
13865,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,a large number of recorded folk-tales and the _Beowulf-Grettir_ story. The
13866,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"parallel is not merely with an artificial, theoretical composite put"
13867,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,together by Panzer. But it becomes equally clear that _Beowulf_ cannot be
13868,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,spoken of as a version of these folk-tales. At most it is a version of a
13869,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,portion of them. The omission of the princesses in _Beowulf_ and the
13870,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,_Grettis Saga_ is fundamental. With the princesses much else falls away.
13871,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,There is no longer any motive for the betrayal of trust {381} by the
13872,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,watchers. The disguise of the hero and his vengeance are now no longer
13873,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,necessary to the tale.
13874,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13875,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13876,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13877,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,It might be argued that there was something about the three princesses
13878,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,which made them unsatisfactory as subjects of story. It has been thought
13879,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,that in the oldest version the hero married all three: an awkward episode
13880,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,where a _scop_ had to compose a poem for an audience certainly monogamous
13881,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,and most probably Christian. The rather tragic and sombre atmosphere of the
13882,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,stories of Beowulf and Grettir fits in better with a version from which the
13883,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"princesses, and the living happily ever afterwards, have been dropped. On"
13884,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the other hand, it might be argued that the folk-tale is composite, and"
13885,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,that the source from which the _Beowulf-Grettir_-story drew was a simpler
13886,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,tale to which the princesses had not yet been added.
13887,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,
13888,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,And there are additions as well as subtractions. Alike in _Beowulf_ and in
13889,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"the _Grettis Saga_, the fight in the house and the fight below are"
13890,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,associated with struggles with monsters of different sex. The association
13891,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"of ""The Devil and his Dam"" has only few and remote parallels in the"
13892,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"""Bear's-son"" folk-tale."

13897,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,"and his plunging down into the deep, is simply an epic glorification of a"
13898,H. BEE-WOLF AND BEAR'S SON,folk-tale motive.

13906,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,"who died 27 Nov. 511. Theudoric died in 534. This, then, gives the extreme"

13916,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,
13917,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,Now Theudobert was born before the death of his grandfather Chlodoweg. For

13922,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,were a precocious race; but if we are to allow Theudobert to have been at
13923,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,"least fifteen before being placed in charge of a very important expedition,"
13924,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,"and Chlodoweg to have been at least forty before becoming a grandfather,"
13925,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,the defeat of Hygelac cannot be put before 521; and probability would
13926,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,favour a date five or ten years later.
13927,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,
13928,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,"There is confirmation for this. When Theudobert died, in 548, he left one"
13929,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,"son only, quite a child and still under tutelage[867]; probably therefore"
13930,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,not more than twelve or thirteen at most. We know the circumstances of the
13931,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,child's birth. Theudobert had been betrothed by his father Theudoric to a
13932,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,"Longobardic princess, Wisigardis[868]. In the meantime he fell in love with"
13933,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,"the lady Deoteria[869], and married her[870]. The Franks were shocked at"
13934,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,"this fickleness (_valde scandalizabantur_), and Theudobert had ultimately"
13935,I. THE DATE OF THE DEATH OF HYGELAC.,"to put away Deoteria[871], although they had this young son (_parvulum"

14120,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,and the _Letter of Alexander on the Wonders of India_. The pieces preceding
14121,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"these, however (the _Soliloquies of S. Augustine_, the _Gospel of"
14122,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"Nicodemus_, _Salomon and Saturn_), are certainly not in the same hand, and"
14123,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,their connection with the _Beowulf_-MS is simply due to the bookbinder.
14124,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,
14125,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"From l. 1939 to the end, _Beowulf_ is written in a second hand, thicker and"
14126,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,less elegant than the first. This second hand seems to be clearly identical
14127,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"with that in which the poem of _Judith_, immediately following _Beowulf_,"
14128,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"is written. This was pointed out by Sievers in 1872 (_Z.f.d.A._ XV, 457),"
14129,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"and has never, I think, been disputed (cf. Sisam, p. 337; Förster, p. 31)."
14130,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,Nevertheless the two poems have probably not always formed one book. For
14131,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"the last page of _Beowulf_ was apparently once the last page of the volume,"
14132,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"to judge from its battered condition, whilst _Judith_ is imperfect at the"
14133,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"beginning. And there are trifling differences, e.g. in the frequency of the"
14134,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"use of contractions, and the form of the capital H."
14135,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,
14136,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,This identity of the scribe of the second portion of _Beowulf_ and the

14138,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,the scribe of the first portion of _Beowulf_ and the scribe of the three
14139,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"preceding works, is important. A detailed comparison of these texts will"
14140,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,throw light upon the characteristics of the scribes.
14141,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,
14142,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,That the three preceding works are in the same hand as that of the first
14143,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"_Beowulf_ scribe was again announced, independently of Mr Sisam, by Prof."
14144,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"Max Förster, in 1919. Sievers had already in 1871 arrived at the same"
14145,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"result (see Förster, p. 35, note) but had not published it."
14146,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,
14147,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,It seems to me in the highest degree improbable that the _Beowulf_-MS has
14148,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"lost its ending, as Prof. Förster thinks (pp. 82, 88). Surely nothing could"
14149,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,be better than the conclusion of the poem as it stands in the MS: that the
14150,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,{386} casual loss of a number of leaves could have resulted in so
14151,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"satisfactory a conclusion is, I think, not conceivable. Moreover, the"
14152,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,scribe has crammed as much material as possible into the last leaf of
14153,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"_Beowulf_, making his lines abnormally long, and using contractions in a"
14154,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,way he does not use them elsewhere. The only reason for this must be to
14155,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,avoid running over into a new leaf or quire: there could be no motive for
14156,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,this crowded page if the poem had ever run on beyond it.
14157,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,
14158,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,There is pretty general agreement that the date of the _Beowulf_-MS is
14159,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"about the year 1000, and that it is somewhat more likely to be before that"
14160,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,date than after.

14162,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,"The _Beowulf_-MS was injured in the great Cottonian fire of 1731, and the"
14163,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,edges of the parchment have since chipped away owing to the damage then
14164,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,sustained. Valuable assistance can therefore be derived from the two

14177,§ 3. THE MS AND ITS TRANSCRIPTS,by Wanley. He describes the poem as telling of the wars _quæ Beowulfus

16766,NOTES,"_Hróðgeirr_. The by-form _Hróarr_, which is used of the famous Danish king,"
16767,NOTES,"is due to a number of rather irregular changes, which can however be"
16768,NOTES,paralleled. The Primitive Germanic form of the name would have been
16769,NOTES,*_Hr[=o]þugaisaz_: for the loss of the _g_ at the beginning of the second

16777,NOTES,"The form _[=E]adgils_ may be due to confusion with the famous Eadgils, king"
16778,NOTES,"of the Myrgingas, who is mentioned in _Widsith_. The name comes only once"
16779,NOTES,in _Beowulf_ (l. 2392) and may owe its form there to a corruption of the
16780,NOTES,scribe. That the O.E. form is corrupt seems more likely than that the O.N.

16784,NOTES,[3] It must be remembered that the sound changes of the Germanic dialects
16785,NOTES,have been worked out so minutely that it is nearly always possible to
16786,NOTES,decide quite definitely whether two names do or do not exactly correspond.

16788,NOTES,phonetically the exact equivalent of _Hroarr_].

16808,NOTES,[7] The identification of Chochilaicus with Hygelac is the most important
16809,NOTES,"discovery ever made in the study of _Beowulf_, and the foundation of our"
16810,NOTES,belief in the historic character of its episodes. It is sometimes
16811,NOTES,"attributed to Grundtvig, sometimes to Outzen. It was first vaguely"
16812,NOTES,"suggested by Grundtvig (_Nyeste Skilderie af Kjøbenhavn_, 1815, col. 1030):"
16813,NOTES,"the importance of the identification was worked out by him fully, two years"
16814,NOTES,"later (_Danne-Virke_, II, 285). In the meantime the passage from Gregory"
16815,NOTES,had been quoted by Outzen in his review of Thorkelin's _Beowulf_ (_Kieler
16816,NOTES,"Blätter_, III, 312). Outzen's reference was obviously made independently,"
16817,NOTES,but he failed to detect the real bearing of the passage upon _Beowulf_.
16818,NOTES,Credit for the find accordingly belongs solely to Grundtvig.

16820,NOTES,[8] Ongentheow is mentioned in _Widsith_ (l. 31) as a famous king of the
16821,NOTES,Swedes. Many of the kings mentioned in the same list can be proved to be
16822,NOTES,"historical, and the reference in _Widsith_ therefore supports Ongentheow's"
16823,NOTES,"historic character, but is far, in itself, from proving it."

16837,NOTES,
16838,NOTES,"[13] But the accounts are quite inconsistent. Saxo (ed. Holder, pp. 56-7)"

18433,"XX, 202-7.","statement of ll. 1125-7, that the warriors departed from the place of"
18434,"XX, 202-7.","combat to see Friesland, seems to necessitate that such place of combat was"
18435,"XX, 202-7.","not in Friesland. Klaeber objects to this (surely obvious) inference: ""If"
18436,"XX, 202-7.",we are to infer [from ll. 1125-7] that Finnsburg lies outside Friesland
18437,"XX, 202-7.","proper, we might as well conclude that _Dyflen_ (Dublin) is not situated in"

18440,"XX, 202-7.","from the _Brunanburh_ lines? What we _are_ justified in inferring, is,"
18441,"XX, 202-7.","surely, that the _site of the battle of Brunanburh_ (from which the"
18442,"XX, 202-7.",Northmen departed to visit Ireland and Dublin) was not identical with
18443,"XX, 202-7.","Dublin, and did not lie in Ireland. And by exact parity of reason, we are"
18444,"XX, 202-7.","justified in arguing that Finnsburg, the site of the first battle in which"

19931,"[871] III, 27.",[872] Many recent historians have expressed doubts as to the conventional
19932,"[871] III, 27.","date, 515, for Hygelac's death. J. P. Jacobsen, in the Danish translation"
19933,"[871] III, 27.",of Gregory (1911) suggested 525-30: following him Severinsen (_Danske
19934,"[871] III, 27.","Studier_, 1919, 96) suggested c. 526, as did Fredborg, _Det första årtalet"

19936,"[871] III, 27.","500, _note_, 1918) suggested c. 528."

19938,"[871] III, 27.",[873] Archæological works bearing less directly upon _Beowulf_ are

19940,"[871] III, 27.",
19941,"[871] III, 27.",[874] Most students nowadays will probably agree with v. Sydow's contention
19942,"[871] III, 27.","that the struggle of Beowulf, first above ground and then below, is a"
19943,"[871] III, 27.","folk-story, one and indivisible, and that therefore there is no reason for"
19944,"[871] III, 27.","attributing the two sections to different authors, as do Boer, Müllenhoff"
19945,"[871] III, 27.",and ten Brink. But that the folk-tale is exclusively Celtic remains to be
19946,"[871] III, 27.",proved; v. Sydow's contention that Celtic influence is shown in _Beowulf_
19947,"[871] III, 27.",by the inhospitable shamelessness of Unferth (compare that of Kai) is
19948,"[871] III, 27.",surely fanciful. Also the statement that the likeness of Bjarki and Beowulf
19949,"[871] III, 27.",is confined to the freeing of the Danish palace from a dangerous monster by
19950,"[871] III, 27.","a stranger from abroad, and that ""das sonstige Beiwerk völlig verschieden"
19951,"[871] III, 27.","ist"" surely cannot be maintained. As argued above (pp. 54-61) there are"
19952,"[871] III, 27.",other distinct points of resemblance.
19953,"[871] III, 27.",
19954,"[871] III, 27.",v. Sydow's statement no doubt suffers from the brevity with which it is
