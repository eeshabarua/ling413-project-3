58,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
59,INTRODUCTION,
60,INTRODUCTION,"Homer's ""Iliad"" begins towards the close of the last of the ten"
61,INTRODUCTION,years of the Trojan War: its incidents extend over some fifty
62,INTRODUCTION,"days only, and it ends with the burial of Hector.  The things"
63,INTRODUCTION,"which came before and after were told by other bards, who between"
64,INTRODUCTION,"them narrated the whole ""cycle"" of the events of the war, and so"
65,INTRODUCTION,were called the Cyclic Poets.  Of their works none have survived;
66,INTRODUCTION,but the story of what befell between Hector's funeral and the
67,INTRODUCTION,"taking of Troy is told in detail, and well told, in a poem about"
68,INTRODUCTION,"half as long as the ""Iliad"".  Some four hundred years after"
69,INTRODUCTION,Christ there lived at Smyrna a poet of whom we know scarce
70,INTRODUCTION,"anything, save that his first name was Quintus.  He had saturated"
71,INTRODUCTION,"himself with the spirit of Homer, he had caught the ring of his"
72,INTRODUCTION,"music, and he perhaps had before him the works of those Cyclic"
73,INTRODUCTION,Poets whose stars had paled before the sun.
74,INTRODUCTION,
75,INTRODUCTION,We have practically no external evidence as to the date or place
76,INTRODUCTION,"of birth of Quintus of Smyrna, or for the sources whence he drew"
77,INTRODUCTION,his materials.  His date is approximately settled by two passages
78,INTRODUCTION,"in the poem, viz. vi. 531 sqq., in which occurs an illustration"
79,INTRODUCTION,"drawn from the man-and-beast fights of the amphitheatre, which"
80,INTRODUCTION,were suppressed by Theodosius I. (379-395 A.D.); and xiii. 335
81,INTRODUCTION,"sqq., which contains a prophecy, the special particularity of"
82,INTRODUCTION,"which, it is maintained by Koechly, limits its applicability to"
83,INTRODUCTION,the middle of the fourth century A.D.
84,INTRODUCTION,
85,INTRODUCTION,"His place of birth, and the precise locality, is given by himself"
86,INTRODUCTION,"in xii. 308-313, and confirmatory evidence is afforded by his"
87,INTRODUCTION,"familiarity, of which he gives numerous instances, with many"
88,INTRODUCTION,natural features of the western part of Asia Minor.
89,INTRODUCTION,
90,INTRODUCTION,"With respect to his authorities, and the use he made of their"
91,INTRODUCTION,"writings, there has been more difference of opinion.  Since his"
92,INTRODUCTION,"narrative covers the same ground as the ""Aethiopis"" (""Coming of"
93,INTRODUCTION,"Memnon"") and the ""Iliupersis"" (""Destruction of Troy"") of Arctinus"
94,INTRODUCTION,"(circ. 776 B.C.), and the ""Little Iliad"" of Lesches (circ. 700"
95,INTRODUCTION,"B.C.), it has been assumed that the work of Quintus ""is little"
96,INTRODUCTION,more than an amplification or remodelling of the works of these
97,INTRODUCTION,"two Cyclic Poets.""  This, however, must needs be pure conjecture,"
98,INTRODUCTION,as the only remains of these poets consist of fragments amounting
99,INTRODUCTION,"to no more than a very few lines from each, and of the ""summaries"
100,INTRODUCTION,"of contents"" made by the grammarian Proclus (circ. 140 A.D.),"
101,INTRODUCTION,"which, again, we but get at second-hand through the ""Bibliotheca"""
102,INTRODUCTION,"of Photius (ninth century).  Now, not merely do the only"
103,INTRODUCTION,descriptions of incident that are found in the fragments differ
104,INTRODUCTION,essentially from the corresponding incidents as described by
105,INTRODUCTION,"Quintus, but even in the summaries, meagre as they are, we find,"
106,INTRODUCTION,"as German critics have shown by exhaustive investigation, serious"
107,INTRODUCTION,"discrepancies enough to justify us in the conclusion that, even"
108,INTRODUCTION,"if Quintus had the works of the Cyclic poets before him, which is"
109,INTRODUCTION,"far from certain, his poem was no mere remodelling of theirs, but"
110,INTRODUCTION,an independent and practically original work.  Not that this
111,INTRODUCTION,conclusion disposes by any means of all difficulties.  If Quintus
112,INTRODUCTION,"did not follow the Cyclic poets, from what source did he draw his"
113,INTRODUCTION,"materials?  The German critic unhesitatingly answers, ""from"
114,INTRODUCTION,"Homer.""  As regards language, versification, and general spirit,"
115,INTRODUCTION,the matter is beyond controversy; but when we come to consider
116,INTRODUCTION,"the incidents of the story, we find deviations from Homer even"
117,INTRODUCTION,more serious than any of those from the Cyclic poets.  And the
118,INTRODUCTION,"strange thing is, that each of these deviations is a manifest"
119,INTRODUCTION,detriment to the perfection of his poem; in each of them the
120,INTRODUCTION,"writer has missed, or has rejected, a magnificent opportunity."
121,INTRODUCTION,With regard to the slaying of Achilles by the hand of Apollo
122,INTRODUCTION,"only, and not by those of Apollo and Paris, he might have pleaded"
123,INTRODUCTION,that Homer himself here speaks with an uncertain voice (cf.
124,INTRODUCTION,"""Iliad"" xv. 416-17, xxii. 355-60, and xxi. 277-78).  But, in"
125,INTRODUCTION,"describing the fight for the body of Achilles (""Odyssey"" xxiv. 36"
126,INTRODUCTION,"sqq.), Homer makes Agamemnon say:"
127,INTRODUCTION,
128,INTRODUCTION,"""So we grappled the livelong day, and we had not refrained"
129,INTRODUCTION,"us then,"
130,INTRODUCTION,"But Zeus sent a hurricane, stilling the storm of the battle"
131,INTRODUCTION,"of men."""
132,INTRODUCTION,
133,INTRODUCTION,"Now, it is just in describing such natural phenomena, and in"
134,INTRODUCTION,"blending them with the turmoil of battle, that Quintus is in his"
135,INTRODUCTION,"element; yet for such a scene he substitutes what is, by"
136,INTRODUCTION,"comparison, a lame and impotent conclusion.  Of that awful cry"
137,INTRODUCTION,that rang over the sea heralding the coming of Thetis and the
138,INTRODUCTION,"Nymphs to the death-rites of her son, and the panic with which it"
139,INTRODUCTION,"filled the host, Quintus is silent.  Again, Homer (""Odyssey"" iv."
140,INTRODUCTION,"274-89) describes how Helen came in the night with Deiphobus, and"
141,INTRODUCTION,"stood by the Wooden Horse, and called to each of the hidden"
142,INTRODUCTION,warriors with the voice of his own wife.  This thrilling scene
143,INTRODUCTION,"Quintus omits, and substitutes nothing of his own.  Later on, he"
144,INTRODUCTION,"makes Menelaus slay Deiphobus unresisting, ""heavy with wine,"""
145,INTRODUCTION,"whereas Homer (""Odyssey"" viii. 517-20) makes him offer such a"
146,INTRODUCTION,"magnificent resistance, that Odysseus and Menelaus together could"
147,INTRODUCTION,"not kill him without the help of Athena.  In fact, we may say"
148,INTRODUCTION,"that, though there are echoes of the ""Iliad"" all through the"
149,INTRODUCTION,"poem, yet, wherever Homer has, in the ""Odyssey"", given the"
150,INTRODUCTION,"outline-sketch of an effective scene, Quintus has uniformly"
151,INTRODUCTION,"neglected to develop it, has sometimes substituted something much"
152,INTRODUCTION,"weaker--as though he had not the ""Odyssey"" before him!"
153,INTRODUCTION,
154,INTRODUCTION,For this we have no satisfactory explanation to offer.  He may
155,INTRODUCTION,have set his own judgment above Homer--a most unlikely hypothesis:
156,INTRODUCTION,"he may have been consistently following, in the framework of his"
157,INTRODUCTION,"story, some original now lost to us: there may be more, and longer,"
158,INTRODUCTION,"lacunae in the text than any editors have ventured to indicate: but,"
159,INTRODUCTION,"whatever theory we adopt, it must be based on mere conjecture."
160,INTRODUCTION,
161,INTRODUCTION,The Greek text here given is that of Koechly (1850) with many of
162,INTRODUCTION,"Zimmermann's emendations, which are acknowledged in the notes."
163,INTRODUCTION,Passages enclosed in square brackets are suggestions of Koechly
164,INTRODUCTION,for supplying the general sense of lacunae.  Where he has made no
165,INTRODUCTION,"such suggestion, or none that seemed to the editors to be"
166,INTRODUCTION,"adequate, the lacuna has been indicated by asterisks, though here"
167,INTRODUCTION,"too a few words have been added in the translation, sufficient to"
168,INTRODUCTION,connect the sense.

216,BOOK I:,"Tarried in Priam's city, sore afraid"

218,BOOK I:,"As kine they were, that midst the copses shrink"
219,BOOK I:,"From faring forth to meet a lion grim,"
220,BOOK I:,But in dense thickets terror-huddled cower;
221,BOOK I:,So in their fortress shivered these to see
222,BOOK I:,That mighty man.  Of those already dead
223,BOOK I:,They thought of all whose lives he reft away
224,BOOK I:,"As by Scamander's outfall on he rushed,"
225,BOOK I:,And all that in mid-flight to that high wall
226,BOOK I:,"He slew, how he quelled Hector, how he haled"
227,BOOK I:,"His corse round Troy;--yea, and of all beside"
228,BOOK I:,Laid low by him since that first day whereon
229,BOOK I:,O'er restless seas he brought the Trojans doom.
230,BOOK I:,"Ay, all these they remembered, while they stayed"

232,BOOK I:,"Hovered dark-winged, as though that very day"
233,BOOK I:,All Troy with shrieks were crumbling down in fire.
234,BOOK I:,
235,BOOK I:,"Then from Thermodon, from broad-sweeping streams,"
236,BOOK I:,"Came, clothed upon with beauty of Goddesses,"
237,BOOK I:,Penthesileia--came athirst indeed
238,BOOK I:,"For groan-resounding battle, but yet more"
239,BOOK I:,"Fleeing abhorred reproach and evil fame,"
240,BOOK I:,Lest they of her own folk should rail on her
241,BOOK I:,"Because of her own sister's death, for whom"
242,BOOK I:,"Ever her sorrows waxed, Hippolyte,"
243,BOOK I:,"Whom she had struck dead with her mighty spear,"
244,BOOK I:,Not of her will--'twas at a stag she hurled.
245,BOOK I:,So came she to the far-famed land of Troy.
246,BOOK I:,"Yea, and her warrior spirit pricked her on,"
247,BOOK I:,Of murder's dread pollution thus to cleanse
248,BOOK I:,"Her soul, and with such sacrifice to appease"
249,BOOK I:,"The Awful Ones, the Erinnyes, who in wrath"
250,BOOK I:,For her slain sister straightway haunted her
251,BOOK I:,Unseen: for ever round the sinner's steps
252,BOOK I:,They hover; none may 'scape those Goddesses.
253,BOOK I:,"And with her followed twelve beside, each one"
254,BOOK I:,"A princess, hot for war and battle grim,"
255,BOOK I:,"Far-famous each, yet handmaids unto her:"
256,BOOK I:,Penthesileia far outshone them all.
257,BOOK I:,As when in the broad sky amidst the stars
258,BOOK I:,"The moon rides over all pre-eminent,"
259,BOOK I:,When through the thunderclouds the cleaving heavens
260,BOOK I:,"Open, when sleep the fury-breathing winds;"
261,BOOK I:,So peerless was she mid that charging host.
262,BOOK I:,"Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe,"
263,BOOK I:,"Evandre, and Antandre, and Bremusa,"
264,BOOK I:,"Hippothoe, dark-eyed Harmothoe,"
265,BOOK I:,"Alcibie, Derimacheia, Antibrote,"
266,BOOK I:,And Thermodosa glorying with the spear.
267,BOOK I:,All these to battle fared with warrior-souled
268,BOOK I:,Penthesileia: even as when descends
269,BOOK I:,"Dawn from Olympus' crest of adamant,"
270,BOOK I:,"Dawn, heart-exultant in her radiant steeds"
271,BOOK I:,"Amidst the bright-haired Hours; and o'er them all,"
272,BOOK I:,"How flawless-fair soever these may be,"
273,BOOK I:,Her splendour of beauty glows pre-eminent;
274,BOOK I:,So peerless amid all the Amazons Unto
275,BOOK I:,Troy-town Penthesileia came.
276,BOOK I:,"To right, to left, from all sides hurrying thronged"
277,BOOK I:,"The Trojans, greatly marvelling, when they saw"
278,BOOK I:,"The tireless War-god's child, the mailed maid,"
279,BOOK I:,Like to the Blessed Gods; for in her face
280,BOOK I:,Glowed beauty glorious and terrible.
281,BOOK I:,Her smile was ravishing: beneath her brows
282,BOOK I:,"Her love-enkindling eyes shone like to stars,"
283,BOOK I:,And with the crimson rose of shamefastness
284,BOOK I:,"Bright were her cheeks, and mantled over them"
285,BOOK I:,Unearthly grace with battle-prowess clad.
286,BOOK I:,
287,BOOK I:,"Then joyed Troy's folk, despite past agonies,"
288,BOOK I:,"As when, far-gazing from a height, the hinds"
289,BOOK I:,"Behold a rainbow spanning the wide sea,"
290,BOOK I:,"When they be yearning for the heaven-sent shower,"
291,BOOK I:,When the parched fields be craving for the rain;
292,BOOK I:,"Then the great sky at last is overgloomed,"
293,BOOK I:,And men see that fair sign of coming wind
294,BOOK I:,"And imminent rain, and seeing, they are glad,"
295,BOOK I:,Who for their corn-fields' plight sore sighed before;
296,BOOK I:,Even so the sons of Troy when they beheld
297,BOOK I:,There in their land Penthesileia dread
298,BOOK I:,"Afire for battle, were exceeding glad;"
299,BOOK I:,"For when the heart is thrilled with hope of good,"
300,BOOK I:,All smart of evils past is wiped away:
301,BOOK I:,"So, after all his sighing and his pain,"
302,BOOK I:,Gladdened a little while was Priam's soul.
303,BOOK I:,As when a man who hath suffered many a pang
304,BOOK I:,"From blinded eyes, sore longing to behold"
305,BOOK I:,"The light, and, if he may not, fain would die,"
306,BOOK I:,"Then at the last, by a cunning leech's skill,"
307,BOOK I:,"Or by a God's grace, sees the dawn-rose flush,"
308,BOOK I:,"Sees the mist rolled back from before his eyes,--"
309,BOOK I:,"Yea, though clear vision come not as of old,"
310,BOOK I:,"Yet, after all his anguish, joys to have"
311,BOOK I:,"Some small relief, albeit the stings of pain"
312,BOOK I:,Prick sharply yet beneath his eyelids;--so
313,BOOK I:,Joyed the old king to see that terrible queen--
314,BOOK I:,The shadowy joy of one in anguish whelmed
315,BOOK I:,"For slain sons.  Into his halls he led the Maid,"
316,BOOK I:,"And with glad welcome honoured her, as one"
317,BOOK I:,Who greets a daughter to her home returned
318,BOOK I:,From a far country in the twentieth year;
319,BOOK I:,"And set a feast before her, sumptuous"
320,BOOK I:,"As battle-glorious kings, who have brought low"
321,BOOK I:,"Nations of foes, array in splendour of pomp,"
322,BOOK I:,With hearts in pride of victory triumphing.
323,BOOK I:,"And gifts he gave her costly and fair to see,"
324,BOOK I:,"And pledged him to give many more, so she"
325,BOOK I:,Would save the Trojans from the imminent doom.
326,BOOK I:,And she such deeds she promised as no man
327,BOOK I:,"Had hoped for, even to lay Achilles low,"
328,BOOK I:,"To smite the wide host of the Argive men,"
329,BOOK I:,And cast the brands red-flaming on the ships.
330,BOOK I:,"Ah fool!--but little knew she him, the lord"
331,BOOK I:,"Of ashen spears, how far Achilles' might"
332,BOOK I:,In warrior-wasting strife o'erpassed her own!
333,BOOK I:,
334,BOOK I:,"But when Andromache, the stately child"
335,BOOK I:,"Of king Eetion, heard the wild queen's vaunt,"
336,BOOK I:,Low to her own soul bitterly murmured she:
337,BOOK I:,"""Ah hapless!  why with arrogant heart dost thou"
338,BOOK I:,Speak such great swelling words?  No strength is thine
339,BOOK I:,To grapple in fight with Peleus' aweless son.
340,BOOK I:,"Nay, doom and swift death shall he deal to thee."
341,BOOK I:,Alas for thee!  What madness thrills thy soul?
342,BOOK I:,Fate and the end of death stand hard by thee!
343,BOOK I:,Hector was mightier far to wield the spear
344,BOOK I:,"Than thou, yet was for all his prowess slain,"
345,BOOK I:,"Slain for the bitter grief of Troy, whose folk"
346,BOOK I:,The city through looked on him as a God.
347,BOOK I:,My glory and his noble parents' glory
348,BOOK I:,Was he while yet he lived--O that the earth
349,BOOK I:,"Over my dead face had been mounded high,"
350,BOOK I:,Or ever through his throat the breath of life
351,BOOK I:,Followed the cleaving spear!  But now have I
352,BOOK I:,"Looked--woe is me!--on grief unutterable,"
353,BOOK I:,When round the city those fleet-footed steeds
354,BOOK I:,"Haled him, steeds of Achilles, who had made"
355,BOOK I:,"Me widowed of mine hero-husband, made"
356,BOOK I:,"My portion bitterness through all my days."""
357,BOOK I:,
358,BOOK I:,So spake Eetion's lovely-ankled child
359,BOOK I:,"Low to her own soul, thinking on her lord."
360,BOOK I:,So evermore the faithful-hearted wife
361,BOOK I:,Nurseth for her lost love undying grief.
362,BOOK I:,
363,BOOK I:,Then in swift revolution sweeping round
364,BOOK I:,"Into the Ocean's deep stream sank the sun,"
365,BOOK I:,And daylight died.  So when the banqueters
366,BOOK I:,"Ceased from the wine-cup and the goodly feast,"
367,BOOK I:,Then did the handmaids spread in Priam's halls
368,BOOK I:,For Penthesileia dauntless-souled the couch
369,BOOK I:,"Heart-cheering, and she laid her down to rest;"
370,BOOK I:,And slumber mist-like overveiled her eyes [depths
371,BOOK I:,Like sweet dew dropping round.  From heavens' blue
372,BOOK I:,Slid down the might of a deceitful dream
373,BOOK I:,"At Pallas' hest, that so the warrior-maid"
374,BOOK I:,"Might see it, and become a curse to Troy"
375,BOOK I:,"And to herself, when strained her soul to meet;"
376,BOOK I:,The whirlwind of the battle.  In this wise
377,BOOK I:,"The Trito-born, the subtle-souled, contrived:"
378,BOOK I:,Stood o'er the maiden's head that baleful dream
379,BOOK I:,"In likeness of her father, kindling her"
380,BOOK I:,Fearlessly front to front to meet in fight
381,BOOK I:,"Fleetfoot Achilles.  And she heard the voice,"
382,BOOK I:,"And all her heart exulted, for she weened"
383,BOOK I:,That she should on that dawning day achieve
384,BOOK I:,A mighty deed in battle's deadly toil
385,BOOK I:,"Ah, fool, who trusted for her sorrow a dream"
386,BOOK I:,"Out of the sunless land, such as beguiles"
387,BOOK I:,"Full oft the travail-burdened tribes of men,"
388,BOOK I:,"Whispering mocking lies in sleeping ears,"
389,BOOK I:,And to the battle's travail lured her then!
390,BOOK I:,
391,BOOK I:,"But when the Dawn, the rosy-ankled, leapt"
392,BOOK I:,"Up from her bed, then, clad in mighty strength"
393,BOOK I:,"Of spirit, suddenly from her couch uprose"
394,BOOK I:,Penthesileia.  Then did she array
395,BOOK I:,Her shoulders in those wondrous-fashioned arms
396,BOOK I:,Given her of the War-god.  First she laid
397,BOOK I:,Beneath her silver-gleaming knees the greaves
398,BOOK I:,"Fashioned of gold, close-clipping the strong limbs."
399,BOOK I:,Her rainbow-radiant corslet clasped she then
400,BOOK I:,"About her, and around her shoulders slung,"
401,BOOK I:,"With glory in her heart, the massy brand"
402,BOOK I:,Whose shining length was in a scabbard sheathed
403,BOOK I:,"Of ivory and silver.  Next, her shield"
404,BOOK I:,"Unearthly splendid, caught she up, whose rim"
405,BOOK I:,Swelled like the young moon's arching chariot-rail
406,BOOK I:,When high o'er Ocean's fathomless-flowing stream
407,BOOK I:,"She rises, with the space half filled with light"
408,BOOK I:,Betwixt her bowing horns.  So did it shine
409,BOOK I:,Unutterably fair.  Then on her head
410,BOOK I:,She settled the bright helmet overstreamed
411,BOOK I:,With a wild mane of golden-glistering hairs.
412,BOOK I:,"So stood she, lapped about with flaming mail,"
413,BOOK I:,"In semblance like the lightning, which the might,"
414,BOOK I:,"The never-wearied might of Zeus, to earth"
415,BOOK I:,"Hurleth, what time he showeth forth to men"
416,BOOK I:,"Fury of thunderous-roaring rain, or swoop"
417,BOOK I:,Resistless of his shouting host of winds.
418,BOOK I:,Then in hot haste forth of her bower to pass
419,BOOK I:,Caught she two javelins in the hand that grasped
420,BOOK I:,Her shield-band; but her strong right hand laid hold
421,BOOK I:,"On a huge halberd, sharp of either blade,"
422,BOOK I:,Which terrible Eris gave to Ares' child
423,BOOK I:,To be her Titan weapon in the strife
424,BOOK I:,That raveneth souls of men.  Laughing for glee
425,BOOK I:,"Thereover, swiftly flashed she forth the ring"
426,BOOK I:,Of towers.  Her coming kindled all the sons
427,BOOK I:,Of Troy to rush into the battle forth
428,BOOK I:,Which crowneth men with glory.  Swiftly all
429,BOOK I:,"Hearkened her gathering-ery, and thronging came,"
430,BOOK I:,"Champions, yea, even such as theretofore"
431,BOOK I:,Shrank back from standing in the ranks of war
432,BOOK I:,Against Achilles the all-ravager.
433,BOOK I:,But she in pride of triumph on she rode
434,BOOK I:,"Throned on a goodly steed and fleet, the gift"
435,BOOK I:,"Of Oreithyia, the wild North-wind's bride,"
436,BOOK I:,"Given to her guest the warrior-maid, what time"
437,BOOK I:,"She came to Thrace, a steed whose flying feet"
438,BOOK I:,Could match the Harpies' wings.  Riding thereon
439,BOOK I:,Penthesileia in her goodlihead
440,BOOK I:,Left the tall palaces of Troy behind.
441,BOOK I:,And ever were the ghastly-visaged Fates
442,BOOK I:,"Thrusting her on into the battle, doomed"
443,BOOK I:,To be her first against the Greeks--and last!
444,BOOK I:,"To right, to left, with unreturning feet"
445,BOOK I:,"The Trojan thousands followed to the fray,"
446,BOOK I:,"The pitiless fray, that death-doomed warrior-maid,"
447,BOOK I:,"Followed in throngs, as follow sheep the ram"
448,BOOK I:,That by the shepherd's art strides before all.
449,BOOK I:,"So followed they, with battle-fury filled,"
450,BOOK I:,Strong Trojans and wild-hearted Amazons.
451,BOOK I:,"And like Tritonis seemed she, as she went"
452,BOOK I:,"To meet the Giants, or as flasheth far"
453,BOOK I:,"Through war-hosts Eris, waker of onset-shouts."
454,BOOK I:,"So mighty in the Trojans' midst she seemed,"
455,BOOK I:,Penthesileia of the flying feet.
456,BOOK I:,
457,BOOK I:,Then unto Cronos' Son Laomedon's child
458,BOOK I:,"Upraised his hands, his sorrow-burdened hands,"
459,BOOK I:,Turning him toward the sky-encountering fane
460,BOOK I:,"Of Zeus of Ida, who with sleepless eyes"
461,BOOK I:,Looks ever down on Ilium; and he prayed:
462,BOOK I:,"""Father, give ear!  Vouchsafe that on this day"
463,BOOK I:,Achaea's host may fall before the hands
464,BOOK I:,"Of this our warrior-queen, the War-god's child;"
465,BOOK I:,And do thou bring her back unscathed again
466,BOOK I:,Unto mine halls: we pray thee by the love
467,BOOK I:,Thou bear'st to Ares of the fiery heart
468,BOOK I:,"Thy son, yea, to her also!  is she not"
469,BOOK I:,Most wondrous like the heavenly Goddesses?
470,BOOK I:,And is she not the child of thine own seed?
471,BOOK I:,Pity my stricken heart withal!  Thou know'st
472,BOOK I:,All agonies I have suffered in the deaths
473,BOOK I:,Of dear sons whom the Fates have torn from me
474,BOOK I:,By Argive hands in the devouring fight.
475,BOOK I:,"Compassionate us, while a remnant yet"
476,BOOK I:,"Remains of noble Dardanus' blood, while yet"
477,BOOK I:,This city stands unwasted!  Let us know
478,BOOK I:,"From ghastly slaughter and strife one breathing-space!"""
479,BOOK I:,
480,BOOK I:,"In passionate prayer he spake:--lo, with shrill scream"
481,BOOK I:,Swiftly to left an eagle darted by
482,BOOK I:,And in his talons bare a gasping dove.
483,BOOK I:,Then round the heart of Priam all the blood
484,BOOK I:,Was chilled with fear.  Low to his soul he said:
485,BOOK I:,"""Ne'er shall I see return alive from war"
486,BOOK I:,"Penthesileia!""  On that selfsame day"
487,BOOK I:,The Fates prepared his boding to fulfil;
488,BOOK I:,And his heart brake with anguish of despair.
489,BOOK I:,
490,BOOK I:,"Marvelled the Argives, far across the plain"
491,BOOK I:,"Seeing the hosts of Troy charge down on them,"
492,BOOK I:,"And midst them Penthesileia, Ares' child."
493,BOOK I:,These seemed like ravening beasts that mid the hills
494,BOOK I:,Bring grimly slaughter to the fleecy flocks;
495,BOOK I:,"And she, as a rushing blast of flame she seemed"
496,BOOK I:,"That maddeneth through the copses summer-scorched,"
497,BOOK I:,When the wind drives it on; and in this wise
498,BOOK I:,Spake one to other in their mustering host:
499,BOOK I:,"""Who shall this be who thus can rouse to war"
500,BOOK I:,"The Trojans, now that Hector hath been slain--"
501,BOOK I:,"These who, we said, would never more find heart"
502,BOOK I:,"To stand against us?  Lo now, suddenly"
503,BOOK I:,"Forth are they rushing, madly afire for fight!"
504,BOOK I:,"Sure, in their midst some great one kindleth them"
505,BOOK I:,To battle's toil!  Thou verily wouldst say
506,BOOK I:,"This were a God, of such great deeds he dreams!"
507,BOOK I:,"Go to, with aweless courage let us arm"
508,BOOK I:,Our own breasts: let us summon up our might
509,BOOK I:,In battle-fury.  We shall lack not help
510,BOOK I:,"Of Gods this day to close in fight with Troy."""
511,BOOK I:,
512,BOOK I:,So cried they; and their flashing battle-gear
513,BOOK I:,Cast they about them: forth the ships they poured
514,BOOK I:,Clad in the rage of fight as with a cloak.
515,BOOK I:,"Then front to front their battles closed, like beasts"
516,BOOK I:,"Of ravin, locked in tangle of gory strife."
517,BOOK I:,"Clanged their bright mail together, clashed the spears,"
518,BOOK I:,"The corslets, and the stubborn-welded shields"
519,BOOK I:,And adamant helms.  Each stabbed at other's flesh
520,BOOK I:,"With the fierce brass: was neither ruth nor rest,"
521,BOOK I:,And all the Trojan soil was crimson-red.
522,BOOK I:,
523,BOOK I:,Then first Penthesileia smote and slew
524,BOOK I:,"Molion; now Persinous falls, and now"
525,BOOK I:,Eilissus; reeled Antitheus 'neath her spear
526,BOOK I:,The pride of Lernus quelled she: down she bore
527,BOOK I:,Hippalmus 'neath her horse-hoofs; Haemon's son
528,BOOK I:,Died; withered stalwart Elasippus' strength.
529,BOOK I:,"And Derinoe laid low Laogonus,"
530,BOOK I:,"And Clonie Menippus, him who sailed"
531,BOOK I:,"Long since from Phylace, led by his lord"
532,BOOK I:,Protesilaus to the war with Troy.
533,BOOK I:,"Then was Podarces, son of Iphiclus,"
534,BOOK I:,Heart-wrung with ruth and wrath to see him lie
535,BOOK I:,"Dead, of all battle-comrades best-beloved."
536,BOOK I:,"Swiftly at Clonie he hurled, the maid"
537,BOOK I:,Fair as a Goddess: plunged the unswerving lance
538,BOOK I:,"'Twixt hip and hip, and rushed the dark blood forth"
539,BOOK I:,"After the spear, and all her bowels gushed out."
540,BOOK I:,Then wroth was Penthesileia; through the brawn
541,BOOK I:,"Of his right arm she drave the long spear's point,"
542,BOOK I:,"She shore atwain the great blood-brimming veins,"
543,BOOK I:,And through the wide gash of the wound the gore
544,BOOK I:,"Spirted, a crimson fountain.  With a groan"
545,BOOK I:,"Backward he sprang, his courage wholly quelled"
546,BOOK I:,By bitter pain; and sorrow and dismay
547,BOOK I:,"Thrilled, as he fled, his men of Phylace."
548,BOOK I:,"A short way from the fight he reeled aside,"
549,BOOK I:,And in his friends' arms died in little space.
550,BOOK I:,"Then with his lance Idomeneus thrust out,"
551,BOOK I:,And by the right breast stabbed Bremusa.  Stilled
552,BOOK I:,For ever was the beating of her heart.
553,BOOK I:,"She fell, as falls a graceful-shafted pine"
554,BOOK I:,"Hewn mid the hills by woodmen: heavily,"
555,BOOK I:,"Sighing through all its boughs, it crashes down."
556,BOOK I:,"So with a wailing shriek she fell, and death"
557,BOOK I:,Unstrung her every limb: her breathing soul
558,BOOK I:,Mingled with multitudinous-sighing winds.
559,BOOK I:,"Then, as Evandre through the murderous fray"
560,BOOK I:,"With Thermodosa rushed, stood Meriones,"
561,BOOK I:,"A lion in the path, and slew: his spear"
562,BOOK I:,"Right to the heart of one he drave, and one"
563,BOOK I:,Stabbed with a lightning sword-thrust 'twixt the hips:
564,BOOK I:,"Leapt through the wounds the life, and fled away."
565,BOOK I:,Oileus' fiery son smote Derinoe
566,BOOK I:,'Twixt throat and shoulder with his ruthless spear;
567,BOOK I:,And on Alcibie Tydeus' terrible son
568,BOOK I:,"Swooped, and on Derimacheia: head with neck"
569,BOOK I:,Clean from the shoulders of these twain he shore
570,BOOK I:,With ruin-wreaking brand.  Together down
571,BOOK I:,"Fell they, as young calves by the massy axe"
572,BOOK I:,"Of brawny flesher felled, that, shearing through"
573,BOOK I:,"The sinews of the neck, lops life away."
574,BOOK I:,"So, by the hands of Tydeus' son laid low"
575,BOOK I:,"Upon the Trojan plain, far, far away"
576,BOOK I:,"From their own highland-home, they fell.  Nor these"
577,BOOK I:,Alone died; for the might of Sthenelus
578,BOOK I:,"Down on them hurled Cabeirus' corse, who came"
579,BOOK I:,"From Sestos, keen to fight the Argive foe,"
580,BOOK I:,But never saw his fatherland again.
581,BOOK I:,Then was the heart of Paris filled with wrath
582,BOOK I:,For a friend slain.  Full upon Sthenelus
583,BOOK I:,"Aimed he a shaft death-winged, yet touched him not,"
584,BOOK I:,Despite his thirst for vengeance: otherwhere
585,BOOK I:,"The arrow glanced aside, and carried death"
586,BOOK I:,"Whither the stern Fates guided its fierce wing,"
587,BOOK I:,"And slew Evenor brazen-tasleted,"
588,BOOK I:,Who from Dulichium came to war with Troy.
589,BOOK I:,For his death fury-kindled was the son
590,BOOK I:,Of haughty Phyleus: as a lion leaps
591,BOOK I:,"Upon the flock, so swiftly rushed he: all"
592,BOOK I:,Shrank huddling back before that terrible man.
593,BOOK I:,"Itymoneus he slew, and Hippasus' son"
594,BOOK I:,Agelaus: from Miletus brought they war
595,BOOK I:,"Against the Danaan men by Nastes led,"
596,BOOK I:,"The god-like, and Amphimachus mighty-souled."
597,BOOK I:,On Mycale they dwelt; beside their home
598,BOOK I:,"Rose Latmus' snowy crests, stretched the long glens"
599,BOOK I:,"Of Branchus, and Panormus' water-meads."
600,BOOK I:,"Maeander's flood deep-rolling swept thereby,"
601,BOOK I:,"Which from the Phrygian uplands, pastured o'er"
602,BOOK I:,"By myriad flocks, around a thousand forelands"
603,BOOK I:,"Curls, swirls, and drives his hurrying ripples on"
604,BOOK I:,Down to the vine-clad land of Carian men
605,BOOK I:,"These mid the storm of battle Meges slew,"
606,BOOK I:,"Nor these alone, but whomsoe'er his lance"
607,BOOK I:,"Black-shafted touched, were dead men; for his breast"
608,BOOK I:,The glorious Trito-born with courage thrilled
609,BOOK I:,To bring to all his foes the day of doom.
610,BOOK I:,"And Polypoetes, dear to Ares, slew"
611,BOOK I:,"Dresaeus, whom the Nymph Neaera bare"
612,BOOK I:,To passing-wise Theiodamas for these
613,BOOK I:,Spread was the bed of love beside the foot
614,BOOK I:,"Of Sipylus the Mountain, where the Gods"
615,BOOK I:,"Made Niobe a stony rock, wherefrom"
616,BOOK I:,"Tears ever stream: high up, the rugged crag"
617,BOOK I:,"Bows as one weeping, weeping, waterfalls"
618,BOOK I:,"Cry from far-echoing Hermus, wailing moan"
619,BOOK I:,Of sympathy: the sky-encountering crests
620,BOOK I:,"Of Sipylus, where alway floats a mist"
621,BOOK I:,"Hated of shepherds, echo back the cry."
622,BOOK I:,Weird marvel seems that Rock of Niobe
623,BOOK I:,To men that pass with feet fear-goaded: there
624,BOOK I:,"They see the likeness of a woman bowed,"
625,BOOK I:,"In depths of anguish sobbing, and her tears"
626,BOOK I:,"Drop, as she mourns grief-stricken, endlessly."
627,BOOK I:,"Yea, thou wouldst say that verily so it was,"
628,BOOK I:,Viewing it from afar; but when hard by
629,BOOK I:,"Thou standest, all the illusion vanishes;"
630,BOOK I:,"And lo, a steep-browed rock, a fragment rent"
631,BOOK I:,"From Sipylus--yet Niobe is there,"
632,BOOK I:,"Dreeing her weird, the debt of wrath divine,"
633,BOOK I:,A broken heart in guise of shattered stone.
634,BOOK I:,
635,BOOK I:,All through the tangle of that desperate fray
636,BOOK I:,Stalked slaughter and doom.  The incarnate Onset-shout
637,BOOK I:,Raved through the rolling battle; at her side
638,BOOK I:,"Paced Death the ruthless, and the Fearful Faces,"
639,BOOK I:,"The Fates, beside them strode, and in red hands"
640,BOOK I:,Bare murder and the groans of dying men.
641,BOOK I:,"That day the beating of full many a heart,"
642,BOOK I:,"Trojan and Argive, was for ever stilled,"
643,BOOK I:,"While roared the battle round them, while the fury"
644,BOOK I:,Of Penthesileia fainted not nor failed;
645,BOOK I:,But as amid long ridges of lone hills
646,BOOK I:,"A lioness, stealing down a deep ravine,"
647,BOOK I:,"Springs on the kine with lightning leap, athirst"
648,BOOK I:,For blood wherein her fierce heart revelleth;
649,BOOK I:,So on the Danaans leapt that warrior-maid.
650,BOOK I:,"And they, their souls were cowed: backward they shrank,"
651,BOOK I:,"And fast she followed, as a towering surge"
652,BOOK I:,Chases across the thunder-booming sea
653,BOOK I:,"A flying bark, whose white sails strain beneath"
654,BOOK I:,"The wind's wild buffering, and all the air"
655,BOOK I:,"Maddens with roaring, as the rollers crash"
656,BOOK I:,On a black foreland looming on the lee
657,BOOK I:,Where long reefs fringe the surf-tormented shores.
658,BOOK I:,"So chased she, and so dashed the ranks asunder"
659,BOOK I:,"Triumphant-souled, and hurled fierce threats before:"
660,BOOK I:,"""Ye dogs, this day for evil outrage done"

673,BOOK I:,
674,BOOK I:,"Then heart-uplifted leapt she on the foe,"

676,BOOK I:,"Ranks upon ranks of Argives, smiting now"
677,BOOK I:,"With that huge halberd massy-headed, now"
678,BOOK I:,"Hurling the keen dart, while her battle-horse"
679,BOOK I:,"Flashed through the fight, and on his shoulder bare"
680,BOOK I:,"Quiver and bow death-speeding, close to her hand,"
681,BOOK I:,If mid that revel of blood she willed to speed
682,BOOK I:,The bitter-biting shaft.  Behind her swept
683,BOOK I:,"The charging lines of men fleet-footed, friends"
684,BOOK I:,And brethren of the man who never flinched
685,BOOK I:,"From close death-grapple, Hector, panting all"
686,BOOK I:,"The hot breath of the War-god from their breasts,"
687,BOOK I:,"All slaying Danaans with the ashen spear,"
688,BOOK I:,Who fell as frost-touched leaves in autumn fall
689,BOOK I:,"One after other, or as drops of rain."
690,BOOK I:,And aye went up a moaning from earth's breast
691,BOOK I:,"All blood-bedrenched, and heaped with corse on corse."
692,BOOK I:,"Horses pierced through with arrows, or impaled"
693,BOOK I:,"On spears, were snorting forth their last of strength"
694,BOOK I:,"With screaming neighings.  Men, with gnashing teeth"
695,BOOK I:,"Biting the dust, lay gasping, while the steeds"
696,BOOK I:,"Of Trojan charioteers stormed in pursuit,"
697,BOOK I:,Trampling the dying mingled with the dead
698,BOOK I:,As oxen trample corn in threshing-floors.
699,BOOK I:,
700,BOOK I:,Then one exulting boasted mid the host
701,BOOK I:,"Of Troy, beholding Penthesileia rush"
702,BOOK I:,"On through the foes' array, like the black storm"
703,BOOK I:,"That maddens o'er the sea, what time the sun"

727,BOOK I:,In overweening exultation so
728,BOOK I:,Vaunted a Trojan.  Fool!--he had no vision
729,BOOK I:,Of ruin onward rushing upon himself
730,BOOK I:,"And Troy, and Penthesileia's self withal."
731,BOOK I:,For not as yet had any tidings come
732,BOOK I:,"Of that wild fray to Aias stormy-souled,"
733,BOOK I:,"Nor to Achilles, waster of tower and town."
734,BOOK I:,But on the grave-mound of Menoetius' son

746,BOOK I:,She aimed the unswerving spear-thrust: aye she pierced
747,BOOK I:,"The backs of them that fled, the breasts of such"
748,BOOK I:,As charged to meet her.  All the long shaft dripped
749,BOOK I:,With steaming blood.  Swift were her feet as wind
750,BOOK I:,As down she swooped.  Her aweless spirit failed
751,BOOK I:,"For weariness nor fainted, but her might"
752,BOOK I:,"Was adamantine.  The impending Doom,"
753,BOOK I:,Which roused unto the terrible strife not yet
754,BOOK I:,"Achilles, clothed her still with glory; still"

805,BOOK I:,And that a husband who for hearth and home
806,BOOK I:,Hath died; some wail for fathers now no more;
807,BOOK I:,Some grieve for brethren and for kinsmen lost.
808,BOOK I:,Not one but hath some share in sorrow's cup.
809,BOOK I:,"Behind all this a fearful shadow looms,"
810,BOOK I:,The day of bondage!  Therefore flinch not ye
811,BOOK I:,"From war, O sorrow-laden!  Better far"
812,BOOK I:,"To die in battle now, than afterwards"
813,BOOK I:,Hence to be haled into captivity
814,BOOK I:,"To alien folk, we and our little ones,"
815,BOOK I:,In the stern grip of fate leaving behind
816,BOOK I:,"A burning city, and our husbands' graves."""
817,BOOK I:,
818,BOOK I:,"So cried she, and with passion for stern war"
819,BOOK I:,Thrilled all those women; and with eager speed
820,BOOK I:,They hasted to go forth without the wall
821,BOOK I:,"Mail-clad, afire to battle for their town"
822,BOOK I:,And people: all their spirit was aflame.
823,BOOK I:,"As when within a hive, when winter-tide"
824,BOOK I:,"Is over and gone, loud hum the swarming bees"
825,BOOK I:,What time they make them ready forth to fare
826,BOOK I:,"To bright flower-pastures, and no more endure"
827,BOOK I:,"To linger therewithin, but each to other"
828,BOOK I:,Crieth the challenge-cry to sally forth;
829,BOOK I:,"Even so bestirred themselves the women of Troy,"
830,BOOK I:,And kindled each her sister to the fray.
831,BOOK I:,"The weaving-wool, the distaff far they flung,"
832,BOOK I:,And to grim weapons stretched their eager hands.
833,BOOK I:,
834,BOOK I:,And now without the city these had died
835,BOOK I:,"In that wild battle, as their husbands died"
836,BOOK I:,"And the strong Amazons died, had not one voice"
837,BOOK I:,"Of wisdom cried to stay their maddened feet,"
838,BOOK I:,When with dissuading words Theano spake:
839,BOOK I:,"""Wherefore, ah wherefore for the toil and strain"
840,BOOK I:,"Of battle's fearful tumult do ye yearn,"
841,BOOK I:,Infatuate ones?  Never your limbs have toiled
842,BOOK I:,In conflict yet.  In utter ignorance
843,BOOK I:,"Panting for labour unendurable,"
844,BOOK I:,Ye rush on all-unthinking; for your strength
845,BOOK I:,"Can never be as that of Danaan men,"
846,BOOK I:,Men trained in daily battle.  Amazons
847,BOOK I:,"Have joyed in ruthless fight, in charging steeds,"
848,BOOK I:,From the beginning: all the toil of men
849,BOOK I:,Do they endure; and therefore evermore
850,BOOK I:,The spirit of the War-god thrills them through.
851,BOOK I:,'They fall not short of men in anything:
852,BOOK I:,Their labour-hardened frames make great their hearts
853,BOOK I:,For all achievement: never faint their knees
854,BOOK I:,Nor tremble.  Rumour speaks their queen to be
855,BOOK I:,A daughter of the mighty Lord of War.
856,BOOK I:,Therefore no woman may compare with her
857,BOOK I:,"In prowess--if she be a woman, not"
858,BOOK I:,A God come down in answer to our prayers.
859,BOOK I:,"Yea, of one blood be all the race of men,"
860,BOOK I:,Yet unto diverse labours still they turn;
861,BOOK I:,And that for each is evermore the best
862,BOOK I:,Whereto he bringeth skill of use and wont.
863,BOOK I:,Therefore do ye from tumult of the fray
864,BOOK I:,"Hold you aloof, and in your women's bowers"
865,BOOK I:,Before the loom still pace ye to and fro;
866,BOOK I:,And war shall be the business of our lords.
867,BOOK I:,"Lo, of fair issue is there hope: we see"
868,BOOK I:,The Achaeans falling fast: we see the might
869,BOOK I:,Of our men waxing ever: fear is none
870,BOOK I:,Of evil issue now: the pitiless foe
871,BOOK I:,Beleaguer not the town: no desperate need
872,BOOK I:,"There is that women should go forth to war."""
873,BOOK I:,
874,BOOK I:,"So cried she, and they hearkened to the words"
875,BOOK I:,Of her who had garnered wisdom from the years;
876,BOOK I:,So from afar they watched the fight.  But still
877,BOOK I:,"Penthesileia brake the ranks, and still"
878,BOOK I:,Before her quailed the Achaeans: still they found
879,BOOK I:,Nor screen nor hiding-place from imminent death.
880,BOOK I:,As bleating goats are by the blood-stained jaws
881,BOOK I:,"Of a grim panther torn, so slain were they."
882,BOOK I:,"In each man's heart all lust of battle died,"
883,BOOK I:,"And fear alone lived.  This way, that way fled"
884,BOOK I:,The panic-stricken: some to earth had flung
885,BOOK I:,The armour from their shoulders; some in dust
886,BOOK I:,Grovelled in terror 'neath their shields: the steeds
887,BOOK I:,Fled through the rout unreined of charioteers.
888,BOOK I:,"In rapture of triumph charged the Amazons,"
889,BOOK I:,With groan and scream of agony died the Greeks.
890,BOOK I:,Withered their manhood was in that sore strait;
891,BOOK I:,Brief was the span of all whom that fierce maid
892,BOOK I:,Mid the grim jaws of battle overtook.
893,BOOK I:,As when with mighty roaring bursteth down
894,BOOK I:,"A storm upon the forest-trees, and some"
895,BOOK I:,"Uprendeth by the roots, and on the earth"
896,BOOK I:,"Dashes them down, the tail stems blossom-crowned,"
897,BOOK I:,"And snappeth some athwart the trunk, and high"
898,BOOK I:,"Whirls them through air, till all confused they lie"
899,BOOK I:,A ruin of splintered stems and shattered sprays;
900,BOOK I:,"So the great Danaan host lay, dashed to dust"
901,BOOK I:,"By doom of Fate, by Penthesileia's spear."
902,BOOK I:,
903,BOOK I:,But when the very ships were now at point
904,BOOK I:,"To be by hands of Trojans set aflame,"
905,BOOK I:,Then battle-bider Aias heard afar
906,BOOK I:,"The panic-cries, and spake to Aeacus' son:"
907,BOOK I:,"""Achilles, all the air about mine ears"
908,BOOK I:,"Is full of multitudinous eries, is full"
909,BOOK I:,Of thunder of battle rolling nearer aye.
910,BOOK I:,"Let us go forth then, ere the Trojans win"
911,BOOK I:,"Unto the ships, and make great slaughter there"
912,BOOK I:,"Of Argive men, and set the ships aflame."
913,BOOK I:,Foulest reproach such thing on thee and me
914,BOOK I:,Should bring; for it beseems not that the seed
915,BOOK I:,Of mighty Zeus should shame the sacred blood
916,BOOK I:,"Of hero-fathers, who themselves of old"
917,BOOK I:,With Hercules the battle-eager sailed
918,BOOK I:,"To Troy, and smote her even at her height"
919,BOOK I:,"Of glory, when Laomedon was king."
920,BOOK I:,"Ay, and I ween that our hands even now"
921,BOOK I:,"Shall do the like: we too are mighty men."""
922,BOOK I:,
923,BOOK I:,He spake: the aweless strength of Aeacus' son
924,BOOK I:,"Hearkened thereto, for also to his ears"
925,BOOK I:,By this the roar of bitter battle came.
926,BOOK I:,"Then hasted both, and donned their warrior-gear"
927,BOOK I:,"All splendour-gleaming: now, in these arrayed"
928,BOOK I:,Facing that stormy-tossing rout they stand.
929,BOOK I:,Loud clashed their glorious armour: in their souls
930,BOOK I:,A battle-fury like the War-god's wrath
931,BOOK I:,Maddened; such might was breathed into these twain
932,BOOK I:,"By Atrytone, Shaker of the Shield,"
933,BOOK I:,As on they pressed.  With joy the Argives saw
934,BOOK I:,The coming of that mighty twain: they seemed
935,BOOK I:,In semblance like Aloeus' giant sons
936,BOOK I:,Who in the old time made that haughty vaunt
937,BOOK I:,Of piling on Olympus' brow the height
938,BOOK I:,"Of Ossa steeply-towering, and the crest"
939,BOOK I:,"Of sky-encountering Pelion, so to rear"
940,BOOK I:,A mountain-stair for their rebellious rage
941,BOOK I:,To scale the highest heaven.  Huge as these
942,BOOK I:,"The sons of Aeacus seemed, as forth they strode"
943,BOOK I:,To stem the tide of war.  A gladsome sight
944,BOOK I:,"To friends who have fainted for their coming, now"
945,BOOK I:,Onward they press to crush triumphant foes.
946,BOOK I:,Many they slew with their resistless spears;
947,BOOK I:,As when two herd-destroying lions come
948,BOOK I:,"On sheep amid the copses feeding, far"
949,BOOK I:,"From help of shepherds, and in heaps on heaps"
950,BOOK I:,"Slay them, till they have drunken to the full"
951,BOOK I:,"Of blood, and filled their maws insatiate"
952,BOOK I:,"With flesh, so those destroyers twain slew on,"
953,BOOK I:,Spreading wide havoc through the hosts of Troy.
954,BOOK I:,
955,BOOK I:,There Deiochus and gallant Hyllus fell
956,BOOK I:,"By Alas slain, and fell Eurynomus"
957,BOOK I:,"Lover of war, and goodly Enyeus died."
958,BOOK I:,But Peleus' son burst on the Amazons
959,BOOK I:,"Smiting Antandre, Polemusa then,"
960,BOOK I:,"Antibrote, fierce-souled Hippothoe,"
961,BOOK I:,Hurling Harmothoe down on sisters slain.
962,BOOK I:,Then hard on all their-reeling ranks he pressed
963,BOOK I:,With Telamon's mighty-hearted son; and now
964,BOOK I:,Before their hands battalions dense and strong
965,BOOK I:,Crumbled as weakly and as suddenly
966,BOOK I:,As when in mountain-folds the forest-brakes
967,BOOK I:,Shrivel before a tempest-driven fire.
968,BOOK I:,
969,BOOK I:,When battle-eager Penthesileia saw
970,BOOK I:,"These twain, as through the scourging storm of war"
971,BOOK I:,"Like ravening beasts they rushed, to meet them there"
972,BOOK I:,"She sped, as when a leopard grim, whose mood"
973,BOOK I:,"Is deadly, leaps from forest-coverts forth,"
974,BOOK I:,"Lashing her tail, on hunters closing round,"
975,BOOK I:,"While these, in armour clad, and putting trust"
976,BOOK I:,"In their long spears, await her lightning leap;"
977,BOOK I:,So did those warriors twain with spears upswung
978,BOOK I:,Wait Penthesileia.  Clanged the brazen plates
979,BOOK I:,About their shoulders as they moved.  And first
980,BOOK I:,Leapt the long-shafted lance sped from the hand
981,BOOK I:,Of goodly Penthesileia.  Straight it flew
982,BOOK I:,"To the shield of Aeacus' son, but glancing thence"
983,BOOK I:,This way and that the shivered fragments sprang
984,BOOK I:,As from a rock-face: of such temper were
985,BOOK I:,The cunning-hearted Fire-god's gifts divine.
986,BOOK I:,Then in her hand the warrior-maid swung up
987,BOOK I:,"A second javelin fury-winged, against"
988,BOOK I:,"Aias, and with fierce words defied the twain:"
989,BOOK I:,"""Ha, from mine hand in vain one lance hath leapt!"
990,BOOK I:,But with this second look I suddenly
991,BOOK I:,"To quell the strength and courage of two foes,--"
992,BOOK I:,"Ay, though ye vaunt you mighty men of war"
993,BOOK I:,"Amid your Danaans!  Die ye shall, and so"
994,BOOK I:,Lighter shall be the load of war's affliction
995,BOOK I:,That lies upon the Trojan chariot-lords.
996,BOOK I:,"Draw nigh, come through the press to grips with me,"
997,BOOK I:,So shall ye learn what might wells up in breasts
998,BOOK I:,Of Amazons.  With my blood is mingled war!
999,BOOK I:,"No mortal man begat me, but the Lord"
1000,BOOK I:,"Of War, insatiate of the battle-cry."
1001,BOOK I:,"Therefore my might is more than any man's."""
1002,BOOK I:,
1003,BOOK I:,With scornful laughter spake she: then she hurled
1004,BOOK I:,Her second lance; but they in utter scorn
1005,BOOK I:,"Laughed now, as swiftly flew the shaft, and smote"
1006,BOOK I:,"The silver greave of Aias, and was foiled"
1007,BOOK I:,"Thereby, and all its fury could not scar"
1008,BOOK I:,The flesh within; for fate had ordered not
1009,BOOK I:,That any blade of foes should taste the blood
1010,BOOK I:,Of Aias in the bitter war.  But he
1011,BOOK I:,"Recked of the Amazon naught, but turned him thence"
1012,BOOK I:,"To rush upon the Trojan host, and left"
1013,BOOK I:,Penthesileia unto Peleus' son
1014,BOOK I:,"Alone, for well he knew his heart within"
1015,BOOK I:,"That she, for all her prowess, none the less"
1016,BOOK I:,"Would cost Achilles battle-toil as light,"
1017,BOOK I:,"As effortless, as doth the dove the hawk."
1018,BOOK I:,
1019,BOOK I:,Then groaned she an angry groan that she had sped
1020,BOOK I:,Her shafts in vain; and now with scoffing speech
1021,BOOK I:,To her in turn the son of Peleus spake:
1022,BOOK I:,"""Woman, with what vain vauntings triumphing"
1023,BOOK I:,"Hast thou come forth against us, all athirst"
1024,BOOK I:,"To battle with us, who be mightier far"
1025,BOOK I:,"Than earthborn heroes?  We from Cronos' Son,"
1026,BOOK I:,"The Thunder-roller, boast our high descent."
1027,BOOK I:,"Ay, even Hector quailed, the battle-swift,"
1028,BOOK I:,"Before us, e'en though far away he saw"
1029,BOOK I:,"Our onrush to grim battle.  Yea, my spear"
1030,BOOK I:,"Slew him, for all his might.  But thou--thine heart"
1031,BOOK I:,"Is utterly mad, that thou hast greatly dared"
1032,BOOK I:,To threaten us with death this day!  On thee
1033,BOOK I:,Thy latest hour shall swiftly come--is come!
1034,BOOK I:,Thee not thy sire the War-god now shall pluck
1035,BOOK I:,"Out of mine hand, but thou the debt shalt pay"
1036,BOOK I:,"Of a dark doom, as when mid mountain-folds"
1037,BOOK I:,"A pricket meets a lion, waster of herds."
1038,BOOK I:,"What, woman, hast thou heard not of the heaps"
1039,BOOK I:,"Of slain, that into Xanthus' rushing stream"
1040,BOOK I:,Were thrust by these mine hands?--or hast thou heard
1041,BOOK I:,"In vain, because the Blessed Ones have stol'n"
1042,BOOK I:,"Wit and discretion from thee, to the end"
1043,BOOK I:,"That Doom's relentless gulf might gape for thee?"""
1044,BOOK I:,
1045,BOOK I:,He spake; he swung up in his mighty hand
1046,BOOK I:,"And sped the long spear warrior-slaying, wrought"
1047,BOOK I:,"By Chiron, and above the right breast pierced"
1048,BOOK I:,The battle-eager maid.  The red blood leapt
1049,BOOK I:,"Forth, as a fountain wells, and all at once"
1050,BOOK I:,Fainted the strength of Penthesileia's limbs;
1051,BOOK I:,Dropped the great battle-axe from her nerveless hand;
1052,BOOK I:,"A mist of darkness overveiled her eyes,"
1053,BOOK I:,And anguish thrilled her soul.  Yet even so
1054,BOOK I:,"Still drew she difficult breath, still dimly saw"
1055,BOOK I:,"The hero, even now in act to drag"
1056,BOOK I:,Her from the swift steed's back.  Confusedly
1057,BOOK I:,"She thought: ""Or shall I draw my mighty sword,"
1058,BOOK I:,"And bide Achilles' fiery onrush, or"
1059,BOOK I:,Hastily cast me from my fleet horse down
1060,BOOK I:,"To earth, and kneel unto this godlike man,"
1061,BOOK I:,And with wild breath promise for ransoming
1062,BOOK I:,"Great heaps of brass and gold, which pacify"
1063,BOOK I:,The hearts of victors never so athirst
1064,BOOK I:,"For blood, if haply so the murderous might"
1065,BOOK I:,"Of Aeacus' son may hearken and may spare,"
1066,BOOK I:,Or peradventure may compassionate
1067,BOOK I:,"My youth, and so vouchsafe me to behold"
1068,BOOK I:,"Mine home again?--for O, I long to live!"""
1069,BOOK I:,
1070,BOOK I:,So surged the wild thoughts in her; but the Gods
1071,BOOK I:,Ordained it otherwise.  Even now rushed on
1072,BOOK I:,In terrible anger Peleus' son: he thrust
1073,BOOK I:,"With sudden spear, and on its shaft impaled"
1074,BOOK I:,"The body of her tempest-footed steed,"
1075,BOOK I:,Even as a man in haste to sup might pierce
1076,BOOK I:,"Flesh with the spit, above the glowing hearth"
1077,BOOK I:,"To roast it, or as in a mountain-glade"
1078,BOOK I:,A hunter sends the shaft of death clear through
1079,BOOK I:,The body of a stag with such winged speed
1080,BOOK I:,"That the fierce dart leaps forth beyond, to plunge"
1081,BOOK I:,Into the tall stem of an oak or pine.
1082,BOOK I:,So that death-ravening spear of Peleus' son
1083,BOOK I:,"Clear through the goodly steed rushed on, and pierced"
1084,BOOK I:,Penthesileia.  Straightway fell she down
1085,BOOK I:,"Into the dust of earth, the arms of death,"
1086,BOOK I:,"In grace and comeliness fell, for naught of shame"
1087,BOOK I:,Dishonoured her fair form.  Face down she lay
1088,BOOK I:,"On the long spear outgasping her last breath,"
1089,BOOK I:,Stretched upon that fleet horse as on a couch;
1090,BOOK I:,Like some tall pine snapped by the icy mace
1091,BOOK I:,"Of Boreas, earth's forest-fosterling"
1092,BOOK I:,"Reared by a spring to stately height, amidst"
1093,BOOK I:,"Long mountain-glens, a glory of mother earth;"
1094,BOOK I:,So from the once fleet steed low fallen lay
1095,BOOK I:,"Penthesileia, all her shattered strength"
1096,BOOK I:,"Brought down to this, and all her loveliness."
1097,BOOK I:,
1098,BOOK I:,Now when the Trojans saw the Warrior-queen
1099,BOOK I:,"Struck down in battle, ran through all their lines"
1100,BOOK I:,A shiver of panic.  Straightway to their walls
1101,BOOK I:,"Turned they in flight, heart-agonized with grief."
1102,BOOK I:,"As when on the wide sea, 'neath buffetings"
1103,BOOK I:,"Of storm-blasts, castaways whose ship is wrecked"
1104,BOOK I:,"Escape, a remnant of a crew, forspent"
1105,BOOK I:,With desperate conflict with the cruel sea:
1106,BOOK I:,"Late and at last appears the land hard by,"
1107,BOOK I:,Appears a city: faint and weary-limbed
1108,BOOK I:,"With that grim struggle, through the surf they strain"
1109,BOOK I:,"To land, sore grieving for the good ship lost,"
1110,BOOK I:,And shipmates whom the terrible surge dragged down
1111,BOOK I:,"To nether gloom; so, Troyward as they fled"
1112,BOOK I:,"From battle, all those Trojans wept for her,"
1113,BOOK I:,"The Child of the resistless War-god, wept"
1114,BOOK I:,For friends who died in groan-resounding fight.
1115,BOOK I:,
1116,BOOK I:,Then over her with scornful laugh the son
1117,BOOK I:,"Of Peleus vaunted: ""In the dust lie there"
1118,BOOK I:,"A prey to teeth of dogs, to ravens' beaks,"
1119,BOOK I:,Thou wretched thing!  Who cozened thee to come
1120,BOOK I:,Forth against me?  And thoughtest thou to fare
1121,BOOK I:,"Home from the war alive, to bear with thee"
1122,BOOK I:,"Right royal gifts from Priam the old king,"
1123,BOOK I:,"Thy guerdon for slain Argives?  Ha, 'twas not"
1124,BOOK I:,"The Immortals who inspired thee with this thought,"
1125,BOOK I:,"Who know that I of heroes mightiest am,"
1126,BOOK I:,"The Danaans' light of safety, but a woe"
1127,BOOK I:,"To Trojans and to thee, O evil-starred!"
1128,BOOK I:,"Nay, but it was the darkness-shrouded Fates"
1129,BOOK I:,And thine own folly of soul that pricked thee on
1130,BOOK I:,"To leave the works of women, and to fare"
1131,BOOK I:,"To war, from which strong men shrink shuddering back."""
1132,BOOK I:,
1133,BOOK I:,"So spake he, and his ashen spear the son"
1134,BOOK I:,"Of Peleus drew from that swift horse, and from"
1135,BOOK I:,Penthesileia in death's agony.
1136,BOOK I:,Then steed and rider gasped their lives away
1137,BOOK I:,Slain by one spear.  Now from her head he plucked
1138,BOOK I:,The helmet splendour-flashing like the beams
1139,BOOK I:,"Of the great sun, or Zeus' own glory-light."
1140,BOOK I:,"Then, there as fallen in dust and blood she lay,"
1141,BOOK I:,"Rose, like the breaking of the dawn, to view"
1142,BOOK I:,"'Neath dainty-pencilled brows a lovely face,"
1143,BOOK I:,"Lovely in death.  The Argives thronged around,"
1144,BOOK I:,"And all they saw and marvelled, for she seemed"
1145,BOOK I:,Like an Immortal.  In her armour there
1146,BOOK I:,"Upon the earth she lay, and seemed the Child"
1147,BOOK I:,"Of Zeus, the tireless Huntress Artemis"
1148,BOOK I:,"Sleeping, what time her feet forwearied are"
1149,BOOK I:,With following lions with her flying shafts
1150,BOOK I:,Over the hills far-stretching.  She was made
1151,BOOK I:,A wonder of beauty even in her death
1152,BOOK I:,"By Aphrodite glorious-crowned, the Bride"
1153,BOOK I:,"Of the strong War-god, to the end that he,"
1154,BOOK I:,"The son of noble Peleus, might be pierced"
1155,BOOK I:,With the sharp arrow of repentant love.
1156,BOOK I:,"The warriors gazed, and in their hearts they prayed"
1157,BOOK I:,"That fair and sweet like her their wives might seem,"
1158,BOOK I:,"Laid on the bed of love, when home they won."
1159,BOOK I:,"Yea, and Achilles' very heart was wrung"
1160,BOOK I:,"With love's remorse to have slain a thing so sweet,"
1161,BOOK I:,"Who might have borne her home, his queenly bride,"
1162,BOOK I:,To chariot-glorious Phthia; for she was
1163,BOOK I:,"Flawless, a very daughter of the Gods,"
1164,BOOK I:,"Divinely tall, and most divinely fair."
1165,BOOK I:,
1166,BOOK I:,Then Ares' heart was thrilled with grief and rage
1167,BOOK I:,For his child slain.  Straight from Olympus down
1168,BOOK I:,"He darted, swift and bright as thunderbolt"
1169,BOOK I:,Terribly flashing from the mighty hand Of
1170,BOOK I:,"Zeus, far leaping o'er the trackless sea,"
1171,BOOK I:,"Or flaming o'er the land, while shuddereth"
1172,BOOK I:,All wide Olympus as it passeth by.
1173,BOOK I:,So through the quivering air with heart aflame
1174,BOOK I:,"Swooped Ares armour-clad, soon as he heard"
1175,BOOK I:,"The dread doom of his daughter.  For the Gales,"
1176,BOOK I:,"The North-wind's fleet-winged daughters, bare to him,"
1177,BOOK I:,"As through the wide halls of the sky he strode,"
1178,BOOK I:,The tidings of the maiden's woeful end.
1179,BOOK I:,"Soon as he heard it, like a tempest-blast"
1180,BOOK I:,Down to the ridges of Ida leapt he: quaked
1181,BOOK I:,Under his feet the long glens and ravines
1182,BOOK I:,"Deep-scored, all Ida's torrent-beds, and all"
1183,BOOK I:,Far-stretching foot-hills.  Now had Ares brought
1184,BOOK I:,"A day of mourning on the Myrmidons,"
1185,BOOK I:,But Zeus himself from far Olympus sent
1186,BOOK I:,Mid shattering thunders terror of levin-bolts
1187,BOOK I:,Which thick and fast leapt through the welkin down
1188,BOOK I:,"Before his feet, blazing with fearful flames."
1189,BOOK I:,"And Ares saw, and knew the stormy threat"
1190,BOOK I:,"Of the mighty-thundering Father, and he stayed"
1191,BOOK I:,"His eager feet, now on the very brink"
1192,BOOK I:,Of battle's turmoil.  As when some huge crag
1193,BOOK I:,Thrust from a beetling cliff-brow by the winds
1194,BOOK I:,"And torrent rains, or lightning-lance of Zeus,"
1195,BOOK I:,"Leaps like a wild beast, and the mountain-glens"
1196,BOOK I:,Fling back their crashing echoes as it rolls
1197,BOOK I:,"In mad speed on, as with resistless swoop"
1198,BOOK I:,"Of bound on bound it rushes down, until"
1199,BOOK I:,"It cometh to the levels of the plain,"
1200,BOOK I:,And there perforce its stormy flight is stayed;
1201,BOOK I:,
1202,BOOK I:,"So Ares, battle-eager Son of Zeus,"
1203,BOOK I:,"Was stayed, how loth soe'er; for all the Gods"
1204,BOOK I:,"To the Ruler of the Blessed needs must yield,"
1205,BOOK I:,"Seeing he sits high-throned above them all,"
1206,BOOK I:,Clothed in his might unspeakable.  Yet still
1207,BOOK I:,"Many a wild thought surged through Ares' soul,"
1208,BOOK I:,Urging him now to dread the terrible threat
1209,BOOK I:,"Of Cronos' wrathful Son, and to return"
1210,BOOK I:,"Heavenward, and now to reck not of his Sire,"
1211,BOOK I:,"But with Achilles' blood to stain those hands,"
1212,BOOK I:,The battle-tireless.  At the last his heart
1213,BOOK I:,Remembered how that many and many a son
1214,BOOK I:,"Of Zeus himself in many a war had died,"
1215,BOOK I:,Nor in their fall had Zeus availed them aught.
1216,BOOK I:,"Therefore he turned him from the Argives--else,"
1217,BOOK I:,"Down smitten by the blasting thunderbolt,"
1218,BOOK I:,"With Titans in the nether gloom he had lain,"
1219,BOOK I:,Who dared defy the eternal will of Zeus.
1220,BOOK I:,
1221,BOOK I:,Then did the warrior sons of Argos strip
1222,BOOK I:,With eager haste from corpses strown all round
1223,BOOK I:,The blood-stained spoils.  But ever Peleus' son
1224,BOOK I:,"Gazed, wild with all regret, still gazed on her,"
1225,BOOK I:,"The strong, the beautiful, laid in the dust;"
1226,BOOK I:,"And all his heart was wrung, was broken down"
1227,BOOK I:,"With sorrowing love, deep, strong as he had known"
1228,BOOK I:,When that beloved friend Patroclus died.
1229,BOOK I:,
1230,BOOK I:,"Loud jeered Thersites, mocking to his face:"
1231,BOOK I:,"""Thou sorry-souled Achilles!  art not shamed"
1232,BOOK I:,To let some evil Power beguile thine heart
1233,BOOK I:,To pity of a pitiful Amazon
1234,BOOK I:,Whose furious spirit purposed naught but ill
1235,BOOK I:,"To us and ours?  Ha, woman-mad art thou,"
1236,BOOK I:,"And thy soul lusts for this thing, as she were"
1237,BOOK I:,"Some lady wise in household ways, with gifts"
1238,BOOK I:,And pure intent for honoured wedlock wooed!
1239,BOOK I:,"Good had it been had her spear reached thine heart,"
1240,BOOK I:,The heart that sighs for woman-creatures still!
1241,BOOK I:,"Thou carest not, unmanly-souled, not thou,"
1242,BOOK I:,"For valour's glorious path, when once thine eye"
1243,BOOK I:,"Lights on a woman!  Sorry wretch, where now"
1244,BOOK I:,Is all thy goodly prowess?  where thy wit?
1245,BOOK I:,And where the might that should beseem a king
1246,BOOK I:,All-stainless?  Dost not know what misery
1247,BOOK I:,This self-same woman-madness wrought for Troy?
1248,BOOK I:,Nothing there is to men more ruinous
1249,BOOK I:,Than lust for woman's beauty; it maketh fools
1250,BOOK I:,Of wise men.  But the toil of war attains
1251,BOOK I:,Renown.  To him that is a hero indeed
1252,BOOK I:,Glory of victory and the War-god's works
1253,BOOK I:,Are sweet.  'Tis but the battle-blencher craves
1254,BOOK I:,"The beauty and the bed of such as she!"""
1255,BOOK I:,
1256,BOOK I:,So railed he long and loud: the mighty heart
1257,BOOK I:,Of Peleus' son leapt into flame of wrath.
1258,BOOK I:,A sudden buffet of his resistless hand
1259,BOOK I:,"Smote 'neath the railer's ear, and all his teeth"
1260,BOOK I:,Were dashed to the earth: he fell upon his face:
1261,BOOK I:,Forth of his lips the blood in torrent gushed:
1262,BOOK I:,Swift from his body fled the dastard soul
1263,BOOK I:,Of that vile niddering.  Achaea's sons
1264,BOOK I:,"Rejoiced thereat, for aye he wont to rail"
1265,BOOK I:,"On each and all with venomous gibes, himself"
1266,BOOK I:,A scandal and the shame of all the host.
1267,BOOK I:,Then mid the warrior Argives cried a voice:
1268,BOOK I:,"""Not good it is for baser men to rail"
1269,BOOK I:,"On kings, or secretly or openly;"
1270,BOOK I:,For wrathful retribution swiftly comes.
1271,BOOK I:,The Lady of Justice sits on high; and she
1272,BOOK I:,"Who heapeth woe on woe on humankind,"
1273,BOOK I:,"Even Ate, punisheth the shameless tongue."""
1274,BOOK I:,
1275,BOOK I:,So mid the Danaans cried a voice: nor yet
1276,BOOK I:,Within the mighty soul of Peleus' son
1277,BOOK I:,"Lulled was the storm of wrath, but fiercely he spake:"
1278,BOOK I:,"""Lie there in dust, thy follies all forgot!"
1279,BOOK I:,'Tis not for knaves to beard their betters: once
1280,BOOK I:,"Thou didst provoke Odysseus' steadfast soul,"
1281,BOOK I:,"Babbling with venomous tongue a thousand gibes,"
1282,BOOK I:,And didst escape with life; but thou hast found
1283,BOOK I:,"The son of Peleus not so patient-souled,"
1284,BOOK I:,Who with one only buffet from his hand
1285,BOOK I:,Unkennels thy dog's soul!  A bitter doom
1286,BOOK I:,Hath swallowed thee: by thine own rascalry
1287,BOOK I:,"Thy life is sped.  Hence from Achaean men,"
1288,BOOK I:,"And mouth out thy revilings midst the dead!"""
1289,BOOK I:,
1290,BOOK I:,So spake the valiant-hearted aweless son
1291,BOOK I:,Of Aeacus.  But Tydeus' son alone
1292,BOOK I:,Of all the Argives was with anger stirred
1293,BOOK I:,"Against Achilles for Thersites slain,"
1294,BOOK I:,"Seeing these twain were of the self-same blood,"
1295,BOOK I:,"The one, proud Tydeus' battle-eager son,"
1296,BOOK I:,"The other, seed of godlike Agrius:"
1297,BOOK I:,Brother of noble Oeneus Agrius was;
1298,BOOK I:,And Oeneus in the Danaan land begat
1299,BOOK I:,"Tydeus the battle-eager, son to whom"
1300,BOOK I:,Was stalwart Diomedes.  Therefore wroth
1301,BOOK I:,"Was he for slain Thersites, yea, had raised"
1302,BOOK I:,"Against the son of Peleus vengeful hands,"
1303,BOOK I:,Except the noblest of Aehaea's sons
1304,BOOK I:,"Had thronged around him, and besought him sore,"
1305,BOOK I:,And held him back therefrom.  With Peleus' son
1306,BOOK I:,"Also they pleaded; else those mighty twain,"
1307,BOOK I:,"The mightiest of all Argives, were at point"
1308,BOOK I:,"To close with clash of swords, so stung were they"
1309,BOOK I:,With bitter wrath; yet hearkened they at last
1310,BOOK I:,"To prayers of comrades, and were reconciled."
1311,BOOK I:,
1312,BOOK I:,Then of their pity did the Atreid kings--
1313,BOOK I:,For these too at the imperial loveliness
1314,BOOK I:,Of Penthesileia marvelled--render up
1315,BOOK I:,"Her body to the men of Troy, to bear"
1316,BOOK I:,Unto the burg of Ilus far-renowned
1317,BOOK I:,With all her armour.  For a herald came
1318,BOOK I:,Asking this boon for Priam; for the king
1319,BOOK I:,Longed with deep yearning of the heart to lay
1320,BOOK I:,"That battle-eager maiden, with her arms,"
1321,BOOK I:,"And with her war-horse, in the great earth-mound"
1322,BOOK I:,Of old Laomedon.  And so he heaped
1323,BOOK I:,A high broad pyre without the city wall:
1324,BOOK I:,Upon the height thereof that warrior-queen
1325,BOOK I:,"They laid, and costly treasures did they heap"
1326,BOOK I:,"Around her, all that well beseems to burn"
1327,BOOK I:,Around a mighty queen in battle slain.
1328,BOOK I:,"And so the Fire-god's swift-upleaping might,"
1329,BOOK I:,"The ravening flame, consumed her.  All around"
1330,BOOK I:,"The people stood on every hand, and quenched"
1331,BOOK I:,The pyre with odorous wine.  Then gathered they
1332,BOOK I:,"The bones, and poured sweet ointment over them,"
1333,BOOK I:,And laid them in a casket: over all
1334,BOOK I:,"Shed they the rich fat of a heifer, chief"
1335,BOOK I:,Among the herds that grazed on Ida's slope.
1336,BOOK I:,"And, as for a beloved daughter, rang"
1337,BOOK I:,"All round the Trojan men's heart-stricken wail,"
1338,BOOK I:,As by the stately wall they buried her
1339,BOOK I:,"On an outstanding tower, beside the bones"
1340,BOOK I:,"Of old Laomedon, a queen beside"
1341,BOOK I:,A king.  This honour for the War-god's sake
1342,BOOK I:,"They rendered, and for Penthesileia's own."
1343,BOOK I:,And in the plain beside her buried they
1344,BOOK I:,"The Amazons, even all that followed her"
1345,BOOK I:,"To battle, and by Argive spears were slain."
1346,BOOK I:,For Atreus' sons begrudged not these the boon
1347,BOOK I:,"Of tear-besprinkled graves, but let their friends,"
1348,BOOK I:,"The warrior Trojans, draw their corpses forth,"
1349,BOOK I:,"Yea, and their own slain also, from amidst"
1350,BOOK I:,The swath of darts o'er that grim harvest-field.
1351,BOOK I:,Wrath strikes not at the dead: pitied are foes
1352,BOOK I:,"When life has fled, and left them foes no more."
1353,BOOK I:,
1354,BOOK I:,Far off across the plain the while uprose
1355,BOOK I:,Smoke from the pyres whereon the Argives laid
1356,BOOK I:,The many heroes overthrown and slain
1357,BOOK I:,By Trojan hands what time the sword devoured;
1358,BOOK I:,And multitudinous lamentation wailed
1359,BOOK I:,Over the perished.  But above the rest
1360,BOOK I:,"Mourned they o'er brave Podarces, who in fight"
1361,BOOK I:,Was no less mighty than his hero-brother
1362,BOOK I:,"Protesilaus, he who long ago"
1363,BOOK I:,"Fell, slain of Hector: so Podarces now,"
1364,BOOK I:,"Struck down by Penthesileia's spear, hath cast"
1365,BOOK I:,Over all Argive hearts the pall of grief.
1366,BOOK I:,Wherefore apart from him they laid in clay
1367,BOOK I:,The common throng of slain; but over him
1368,BOOK I:,Toiling they heaped an earth-mound far-descried
1369,BOOK I:,In memory of a warrior aweless-souled.
1370,BOOK I:,And in a several pit withal they thrust
1371,BOOK I:,The niddering Thersites' wretched corse.
1372,BOOK I:,"Then to the ships, acclaiming Aeacus' son,"
1373,BOOK I:,Returned they all.  But when the radiant day
1374,BOOK I:,"Had plunged beneath the Ocean-stream, and night,"
1375,BOOK I:,"The holy, overspread the face of earth,"
1376,BOOK I:,Then in the rich king Agamemnon's tent
1377,BOOK I:,"Feasted the might of Peleus' son, and there"
1378,BOOK I:,Sat at the feast those other mighty ones
1379,BOOK I:,"All through the dark, till rose the dawn divine."

1389,BOOK II,The splendour of the tireless-racing sun
1390,BOOK II,"Poured o'er the land, still in their tents rejoiced"
1391,BOOK II,"Achaea's stalwart sons, and still acclaimed"
1392,BOOK II,Achilles the resistless.  But in Troy
1393,BOOK II,"Still mourned her people, still from all her towers"
1394,BOOK II,Seaward they strained their gaze; for one great fear
1395,BOOK II,Gripped all their hearts--to see that terrible man
1396,BOOK II,"At one bound overleap their high-built wall,"
1397,BOOK II,"Then smite with the sword all people therewithin,"
1398,BOOK II,"And burn with fire fanes, palaces, and homes."
1399,BOOK II,And old Thymoetes spake to the anguished ones:
1400,BOOK II,"""Friends, I have lost hope: mine heart seeth not"
1401,BOOK II,"Or help, or bulwark from the storm of war,"
1402,BOOK II,"Now that the aweless Hector, who was once"
1403,BOOK II,"Troy's mighty champion, is in dust laid low."
1404,BOOK II,"Not all his might availed to escape the Fates,"
1405,BOOK II,"But overborne he was by Achilles' hands,"
1406,BOOK II,"The hands that would, I verily deem, bear down"
1407,BOOK II,"A God, if he defied him to the fight,"
1408,BOOK II,Even as he overthrew this warrior-queen
1409,BOOK II,"Penthesileia battle-revelling,"
1410,BOOK II,From whom all other Argives shrank in fear.
1411,BOOK II,"Ah, she was marvellous!  When at the first"
1412,BOOK II,"I looked on her, meseemed a Blessed One"
1413,BOOK II,From heaven had come down hitherward to bring
1414,BOOK II,"Light to our darkness--ah, vain hope, vain dream!"
1415,BOOK II,"Go to, let us take counsel, what to do"
1416,BOOK II,Were best for us.  Or shall we still maintain
1417,BOOK II,"A hopeless fight against these ruthless foes,"
1418,BOOK II,Or shall we straightway flee a city doomed?
1419,BOOK II,"Ay, doomed!--for never more may we withstand"
1420,BOOK II,"Argives in fighting field, when in the front"
1421,BOOK II,"Of battle pitiless Achilles storms."""
1422,BOOK II,
1423,BOOK II,"Then spake Laomedon's son, the ancient king:"

1437,BOOK II,"To Troy, and make all end of all our woes."
1438,BOOK II,"And now, I trust, he is nigh.  Let us endure"

1497,BOOK II,"Who maketh faint the hearts of all the host!"""
1498,BOOK II,
1499,BOOK II,So fiercely he reviled: Polydamas
1500,BOOK II,"Wrathfully answered; for he shrank not, he,"
1501,BOOK II,"From answering to his face.  A caitiff hound,"
1502,BOOK II,"A reptile fool, is he who fawns on men"
1503,BOOK II,"Before their faces, while his heart is black"
1504,BOOK II,"With malice, and, when they be gone, his tongue"
1505,BOOK II,Backbites them.  Openly Polydamas

1507,BOOK II,"""O thou of living men most mischievous!"
1508,BOOK II,Thy valour--quotha!--brings us misery!

1515,BOOK II,
1516,BOOK II,"Indignantly he spake, and Paris found"
1517,BOOK II,"No word to answer him, for conscience woke"
1518,BOOK II,"Remembrance of all woes he had brought on Troy,"
1519,BOOK II,And should bring; for his passion-fevered heart
1520,BOOK II,Would rather hail quick death than severance
1521,BOOK II,"From Helen the divinely fair, although"
1522,BOOK II,For her sake was it that the sons of Troy
1523,BOOK II,Even then were gazing from their towers to see
1524,BOOK II,The Argives and Achilles drawing nigh.
1525,BOOK II,
1526,BOOK II,But no long time thereafter came to them
1527,BOOK II,"Memnon the warrior-king, and brought with him"
1528,BOOK II,A countless host of swarthy Aethiops.
1529,BOOK II,From all the streets of Troy the Trojans flocked
1530,BOOK II,"Glad-eyed to gaze on him, as seafarers,"
1531,BOOK II,"With ruining tempest utterly forspent,"
1532,BOOK II,See through wide-parting clouds the radiance
1533,BOOK II,Of the eternal-wheeling Northern Wain;
1534,BOOK II,"So joyed the Troyfolk as they thronged around,"
1535,BOOK II,"And more than all Laomedon's son, for now"
1536,BOOK II,"Leapt in his heart a hope, that yet the ships"
1537,BOOK II,Might by those Aethiop men be burned with fire;
1538,BOOK II,"So giantlike their king was, and themselves"
1539,BOOK II,"So huge a host, and so athirst for fight."
1540,BOOK II,Therefore with all observance welcomed he
1541,BOOK II,The strong son of the Lady of the Dawn
1542,BOOK II,With goodly gifts and with abundant cheer.
1543,BOOK II,So at the banquet King and Hero sat
1544,BOOK II,"And talked, this telling of the Danaan chiefs,"
1545,BOOK II,"And all the woes himself had suffered, that"
1546,BOOK II,Telling of that strange immortality
1547,BOOK II,"By the Dawn-goddess given to his sire,"
1548,BOOK II,Telling of the unending flow and ebb
1549,BOOK II,"Of the Sea-mother, of the sacred flood"
1550,BOOK II,"Of Ocean fathomless-rolling, of the bounds"
1551,BOOK II,"Of Earth that wearieth never of her travail,"
1552,BOOK II,"Of where the Sun-steeds leap from orient waves,"
1553,BOOK II,Telling withal of all his wayfaring
1554,BOOK II,"From Ocean's verge to Priam's wall, and spurs"
1555,BOOK II,"Of Ida.  Yea, he told how his strong hands"
1556,BOOK II,Smote the great army of the Solymi
1557,BOOK II,"Who barred his way, whose deed presumptuous brought"
1558,BOOK II,Upon their own heads crushing ruin and woe.
1559,BOOK II,"So told he all that marvellous tale, and told"
1560,BOOK II,Of countless tribes and nations seen of him.
1561,BOOK II,"And Priam heard, and ever glowed his heart"
1562,BOOK II,Within him; and the old lips answering spake:
1563,BOOK II,"""Memnon, the Gods are good, who have vouchsafed"
1564,BOOK II,"To me to look upon thine host, and thee"
1565,BOOK II,Here in mine halls.  O that their grace would so
1566,BOOK II,"Crown this their boon, that I might see my foes"
1567,BOOK II,All thrust to one destruction by thy spears.
1568,BOOK II,"That well may be, for marvellous-like art thou"
1569,BOOK II,"To some invincible Deathless One, yea, more"
1570,BOOK II,"Than any earthly hero.  Wherefore thou,"
1571,BOOK II,"I trust, shalt hurl wild havoc through their host."
1572,BOOK II,"But now, I pray thee, for this day do thou"
1573,BOOK II,"Cheer at my feast thine heart, and with the morn"
1574,BOOK II,"Shalt thou go forth to battle worthy of thee."""
1575,BOOK II,
1576,BOOK II,Then in his hands a chalice deep and wide
1577,BOOK II,"He raised, and Memnon in all love he pledged"
1578,BOOK II,"In that huge golden cup, a gift of Gods;"
1579,BOOK II,"For this the cunning God-smith brought to Zeus,"
1580,BOOK II,"His masterpiece, what time the Mighty in Power"
1581,BOOK II,To Hephaestus gave for bride the Cyprian Queen;
1582,BOOK II,And Zeus on Dardanus his godlike son
1583,BOOK II,"Bestowed it, he on Erichthonius;"
1584,BOOK II,Erichthonius to Tros the great of heart
1585,BOOK II,"Gave it, and he with all his treasure-store"
1586,BOOK II,"Bequeathed it unto Ilus, and he gave"
1587,BOOK II,"That wonder to Laomedon, and he"
1588,BOOK II,"To Priam, who had thought to leave the same"
1589,BOOK II,To his own son.  Fate ordered otherwise.
1590,BOOK II,And Memnon clasped his hands about that cup
1591,BOOK II,"So peerless-beautiful, and all his heart"
1592,BOOK II,Marvelled; and thus he spake unto the King:
1593,BOOK II,"""Beseems not with great swelling words to vaunt"
1594,BOOK II,"Amidst the feast, and lavish promises,"
1595,BOOK II,"But rather quietly to eat in hall,"
1596,BOOK II,And to devise deeds worthy.  Whether I
1597,BOOK II,"Be brave and strong, or whether I be not,"
1598,BOOK II,"Battle, wherein a man's true might is seen,"
1599,BOOK II,"Shall prove to thee.  Now would I rest, nor drink"
1600,BOOK II,The long night through.  The battle-eager spirit
1601,BOOK II,"By measureless wine and lack of sleep is dulled."""
1602,BOOK II,
1603,BOOK II,"Marvelled at him the old King, and he said:"
1604,BOOK II,"""As seems thee good touching the banquet, do"
1605,BOOK II,"After thy pleasure.  I, when thou art loth,"
1606,BOOK II,"Will not constrain thee.  Yea, unmeet it is"
1607,BOOK II,"To hold back him who fain would leave the board,"
1608,BOOK II,Or hurry from one's halls who fain would stay.
1609,BOOK II,"So is the good old law with all true men."""
1610,BOOK II,
1611,BOOK II,"Then rose that champion from the board, and passed"
1612,BOOK II,Thence to his sleep--his last!  And with him went
1613,BOOK II,All others from the banquet to their rest:
1614,BOOK II,And gentle sleep slid down upon them soon.
1615,BOOK II,
1616,BOOK II,"But in the halls of Zeus, the Lightning-lord,"
1617,BOOK II,"Feasted the gods the while, and Cronos' son,"
1618,BOOK II,"All-father, of his deep foreknowledge spake"
1619,BOOK II,Amidst them of the issue of the strife:
1620,BOOK II,"""Be it known unto you all, to-morn shall bring"
1621,BOOK II,By yonder war affliction swift and sore;
1622,BOOK II,For many mighty horses shall ye see
1623,BOOK II,"In either host beside their chariots slain,"
1624,BOOK II,And many heroes perishing.  Therefore ye
1625,BOOK II,"Remember these my words, howe'er ye grieve"
1626,BOOK II,"For dear ones.  Let none clasp my knees in prayer,"
1627,BOOK II,"Since even to us relentless are the fates."""
1628,BOOK II,
1629,BOOK II,"So warned he them, which knew before, that all"
1630,BOOK II,"Should from the battle stand aside, howe'er"
1631,BOOK II,"Heart-wrung; that none, petitioning for a son"
1632,BOOK II,"Or dear one, should to Olympus vainly come."
1633,BOOK II,"So, at that warning of the Thunderer,"
1634,BOOK II,"The Son of Cronos, all they steeled their hearts"
1635,BOOK II,"To bear, and spake no word against their king;"
1636,BOOK II,For in exceeding awe they stood of him.
1637,BOOK II,Yet to their several mansions and their rest
1638,BOOK II,With sore hearts went they.  O'er their deathless eyes
1639,BOOK II,The blessing-bringer Sleep his light veils spread.
1640,BOOK II,
1641,BOOK II,When o'er precipitous crests of mountain-walls
1642,BOOK II,Leapt up broad heaven the bright morning-star
1643,BOOK II,Who rouseth to their toils from slumber sweet
1644,BOOK II,"The binders of the sheaf, then his last sleep"
1645,BOOK II,Unclasped the warrior-son of her who brings
1646,BOOK II,"Light to the world, the Child of Mists of Night."
1647,BOOK II,Now swelled his mighty heart with eagerness
1648,BOOK II,To battle with the foe forthright.  And Dawn
1649,BOOK II,With most reluctant feet began to climb
1650,BOOK II,Heaven's broad highway.  Then did the Trojans gird
1651,BOOK II,Their battle-harness on; then armed themselves
1652,BOOK II,"The Aethiop men, and all the mingled tribes"
1653,BOOK II,Of those war-helpers that from many lands
1654,BOOK II,To Priam's aid were gathered.  Forth the gates
1655,BOOK II,"Swiftly they rushed, like darkly lowering clouds"
1656,BOOK II,"Which Cronos' Son, when storm is rolling up,"
1657,BOOK II,Herdeth together through the welkin wide.
1658,BOOK II,Swiftly the whole plain filled.  Onward they streamed
1659,BOOK II,Like harvest-ravaging locusts drifting on
1660,BOOK II,In fashion of heavy-brooding rain-clouds o'er
1661,BOOK II,"Wide plains of earth, an irresistible host"
1662,BOOK II,Bringing wan famine on the sons of men;
1663,BOOK II,So in their might and multitude they went.
1664,BOOK II,The city streets were all too strait for them
1665,BOOK II,Marching: upsoared the dust from underfoot.
1666,BOOK II,
1667,BOOK II,"From far the Argives gazed, and marvelling saw"
1668,BOOK II,"Their onrush, but with speed arrayed their limbs"
1669,BOOK II,"In brass, and in the might of Peleus' son"
1670,BOOK II,Put their glad trust.  Amidst them rode he on
1671,BOOK II,"Like to a giant Titan, glorying"
1672,BOOK II,"In steeds and chariot, while his armour flashed"
1673,BOOK II,Splendour around in sudden lightning-gleams.
1674,BOOK II,It was as when the sun from utmost bounds
1675,BOOK II,"Of earth-encompassing ocean comes, and brings"
1676,BOOK II,"Light to the world, and flings his splendour wide"
1677,BOOK II,"Through heaven, and earth and air laugh all around."
1678,BOOK II,"So glorious, mid the Argives Peleus' son"
1679,BOOK II,Rode onward.  Mid the Trojans rode the while
1680,BOOK II,"Memnon the hero, even such to see"
1681,BOOK II,As Ares furious-hearted.  Onward swept
1682,BOOK II,The eager host arrayed about their lord.
1683,BOOK II,
1684,BOOK II,Then in the grapple of war on either side
1685,BOOK II,"Closed the long lines, Trojan and Danaan;"
1686,BOOK II,But chief in prowess still the Aethiops were.
1687,BOOK II,Crashed they together as when surges meet
1688,BOOK II,"On the wild sea, when, in a day of storm,"
1689,BOOK II,From every quarter winds to battle rush.
1690,BOOK II,"Foe hurled at foe the ashen spear, and slew:"
1691,BOOK II,Screams and death-groans went up like roaring fire.
1692,BOOK II,As when down-thundering torrents shout and rave
1693,BOOK II,"On-pouring seaward, when the madding rains"
1694,BOOK II,"Stream from God's cisterns, when the huddling clouds"
1695,BOOK II,"Are hurled against each other ceaselessly,"
1696,BOOK II,And leaps their fiery breath in flashes forth;
1697,BOOK II,So 'neath the fighters' trampling feet the earth
1698,BOOK II,"Thundered, and leapt the terrible battle-yell"
1699,BOOK II,"Through frenzied air, for mad the war-cries were."
1700,BOOK II,
1701,BOOK II,For firstfruits of death's harvest Peleus' son
1702,BOOK II,"Slew Thalius and Mentes nobly born,"
1703,BOOK II,"Men of renown, and many a head beside"
1704,BOOK II,Dashed he to dust.  As in its furious swoop
1705,BOOK II,"A whirlwind shakes dark chasms underground,"
1706,BOOK II,And earth's foundations crumble and melt away
1707,BOOK II,"Around the deep roots of the shuddering world,"
1708,BOOK II,So the ranks crumbled in swift doom to the dust
1709,BOOK II,Before the spear and fury of Peleus's son.
1710,BOOK II,
1711,BOOK II,But on the other side the hero child
1712,BOOK II,"Of the Dawn-goddess slew the Argive men,"
1713,BOOK II,Like to a baleful Doom which bringeth down
1714,BOOK II,On men a grim and ghastly pestilence.
1715,BOOK II,First slew he Pheron; for the bitter spear
1716,BOOK II,"Plunged through his breast, and down on him he hurled"
1717,BOOK II,"Goodly Ereuthus, battle-revellers both,"
1718,BOOK II,"Dwellers in Thryus by Alpheus' streams,"
1719,BOOK II,Which followed Nestor to the god-built burg
1720,BOOK II,"Of Ilium.  But when he had laid these low,"
1721,BOOK II,Against the son of Neleus pressed he on
1722,BOOK II,Eager to slay.  Godlike Antilochus
1723,BOOK II,"Strode forth to meet him, sped the long spear's flight,"
1724,BOOK II,"Yet missed him, for a little he swerved, but slew"
1725,BOOK II,"His Aethiop comrade, son of Pyrrhasus."
1726,BOOK II,"Wroth for his fall, against Antilochus"
1727,BOOK II,"He leapt, as leaps a lion mad of mood"
1728,BOOK II,"Upon a boar, the beast that flincheth not"
1729,BOOK II,"From fight with man or brute, whose charge is a flash"
1730,BOOK II,Of lightning; so was his swift leap.  His foe
1731,BOOK II,"Antilochus caught a huge stone from the ground,"
1732,BOOK II,"Hurled, smote him; but unshaken abode his strength,"
1733,BOOK II,For the strong helm-crest fenced his head from death;
1734,BOOK II,But rang the morion round his brows.  His heart
1735,BOOK II,Kindled with terrible fury at the blow
1736,BOOK II,More than before against Antilochus.
1737,BOOK II,Like seething cauldron boiled his maddened might.
1738,BOOK II,"He stabbed, for all his cunning of fence, the son"
1739,BOOK II,Of Nestor above the breast; the crashing spear
1740,BOOK II,"Plunged to the heart, the spot of speediest death."
1741,BOOK II,
1742,BOOK II,Then upon all the Danaans at his fall
1743,BOOK II,Came grief; but anguish-stricken was the heart
1744,BOOK II,"Of Nestor most of all, to see his child"
1745,BOOK II,Slain in his sight; for no more bitter pang
1746,BOOK II,Smiteth the heart of man than when a son
1747,BOOK II,"Perishes, and his father sees him die."
1748,BOOK II,"Therefore, albeit unused to melting mood,"
1749,BOOK II,His soul was torn with agony for the son
1750,BOOK II,By black death slain.  A wild cry hastily
1751,BOOK II,To Thrasymedes did he send afar:
1752,BOOK II,"""Hither to me, Thrasymedes war-renowned!"
1753,BOOK II,"Help me to thrust back from thy brother's corse,"
1754,BOOK II,"Yea, from mine hapless son, his murderer,"
1755,BOOK II,That so ourselves may render to our dead
1756,BOOK II,"All dues of mourning.  If thou flinch for fear,"
1757,BOOK II,"No son of mine art thou, nor of the line"
1758,BOOK II,"Of Periclymenus, who dared withstand"
1759,BOOK II,"Hercules' self.  Come, to the battle-toil!"
1760,BOOK II,For grim necessity oftentimes inspires
1761,BOOK II,"The very coward with courage of despair."""
1762,BOOK II,
1763,BOOK II,Then at his cry that brother's heart was stung
1764,BOOK II,With bitter grief.  Swift for his help drew nigh
1765,BOOK II,"Phereus, on whom for his great prince's fall"
1766,BOOK II,Came anguish.  Charged these warriors twain to face
1767,BOOK II,Strong Memnon in the gory strife.  As when
1768,BOOK II,"Two hunters 'mid a forest's mountain-folds,"
1769,BOOK II,"Eager to take the prey, rush on to meet"
1770,BOOK II,"A wild boar or a bear, with hearts afire"
1771,BOOK II,"To slay him, but in furious mood he leaps"
1772,BOOK II,"On them, and holds at bay the might of men;"
1773,BOOK II,"So swelled the heart of Memnon.  Nigh drew they,"
1774,BOOK II,"Yet vainly essayed to slay him, as they hurled"
1775,BOOK II,"The long spears, but the lances glanced aside"
1776,BOOK II,Far from his flesh: the Dawn-queen turned them thence.
1777,BOOK II,Yet fell their spears not vainly to the ground:
1778,BOOK II,"The lance of fiery-hearted Phereus, winged"
1779,BOOK II,"With eager speed, dealt death to Meges' son,"
1780,BOOK II,Polymnius: Laomedon was slain
1781,BOOK II,"By the wrath of Nestor's son for a brother dead,"
1782,BOOK II,"The dear one Memnon slew in battle-rout,"
1783,BOOK II,And whom the slayer's war-unwearied hands
1784,BOOK II,"Now stripped of his all-brazen battle-gear,"
1785,BOOK II,"Nought recking, he, of Thrasymedes' might,"
1786,BOOK II,"Nor of stout Phereus, who were unto him"
1787,BOOK II,But weaklings.  A great lion seemed he there
1788,BOOK II,"Standing above a hart, as jackals they,"
1789,BOOK II,"That, howso hungry, dare not come too nigh."
1790,BOOK II,
1791,BOOK II,But hard thereby the father gazed thereon
1792,BOOK II,"In agony, and cried the rescue-cry"
1793,BOOK II,To other his war-comrades for their aid
1794,BOOK II,Against the foe.  Himself too burned to fight
1795,BOOK II,From his war-car; for yearning for the dead
1796,BOOK II,Goaded him to the fray beyond his strength.
1797,BOOK II,"Ay, and himself had been on his dear son"
1798,BOOK II,"Laid, numbered with the dead, had not the voice"
1799,BOOK II,Of Memnon stayed him even in act to rush
1800,BOOK II,"Upon him, for he reverenced in his heart"
1801,BOOK II,The white hairs of an age-mate of his sire:
1802,BOOK II,"""Ancient,"" he cried, ""it were my shame to fight."
1803,BOOK II,With one so much mine elder: I am not
1804,BOOK II,Blind unto honour.  Verily I weened
1805,BOOK II,"That this was some young warrior, when I saw"
1806,BOOK II,Thee facing thus the foe.  My bold heart hoped
1807,BOOK II,For contest worthy of mine hand and spear.
1808,BOOK II,"Nay, draw thou back afar from battle-toil"
1809,BOOK II,"And bitter death.  Go, lest, how loth soe'er,"
1810,BOOK II,"I smite thee of sore need.  Nay, fall not thou"
1811,BOOK II,"Beside thy son, against a mightier man"
1812,BOOK II,"Fighting, lest men with folly thee should charge,"
1813,BOOK II,"For folly it is that braves o'ermastering might."""
1814,BOOK II,
1815,BOOK II,"He spake, and answered him that warrior old:"
1816,BOOK II,"""Nay, Memnon, vain was that last word of thine."
1817,BOOK II,"None would name fool the father who essayed,"
1818,BOOK II,"Battling with foes for his son's sake, to thrust"
1819,BOOK II,"The ruthless slayer back from that dear corpse,"
1820,BOOK II,"But ah that yet my strength were whole in me,"
1821,BOOK II,That thou might'st know my spear!  Now canst thou vaunt
1822,BOOK II,Proudly enow: a young man's heart is bold
1823,BOOK II,And light his wit.  Uplifted is thy soul
1824,BOOK II,And vain thy speech.  If in my strength of youth
1825,BOOK II,"Thou hadst met me--ha, thy friends had not rejoiced,"
1826,BOOK II,For all thy might!  But me the grievous weight
1827,BOOK II,"Of age bows down, like an old lion whom"
1828,BOOK II,"A cur may boldly drive back from the fold,"
1829,BOOK II,"For that he cannot, in his wrath's despite,"
1830,BOOK II,"Maintain his own cause, being toothless now,"
1831,BOOK II,"And strengthless, and his strong heart tamed by time."
1832,BOOK II,So well the springs of olden strength no more
1833,BOOK II,Now in my breast.  Yet am I stronger still
1834,BOOK II,Than many men; my grey hairs yield to few
1835,BOOK II,"That have within them all the strength of youth."""
1836,BOOK II,
1837,BOOK II,"So drew he back a little space, and left"
1838,BOOK II,"Lying in dust his son, since now no more"
1839,BOOK II,"Lived in the once lithe limbs the olden strength,"
1840,BOOK II,For the years' weight lay heavy on his head.
1841,BOOK II,"Back leapt Thrasymedes likewise, spearman good,"
1842,BOOK II,"And battle-eager Phereus, and the rest"
1843,BOOK II,Their comrades; for that slaughter-dealing man
1844,BOOK II,Pressed hard on them.  As when from mountains high
1845,BOOK II,A shouting river with wide-echoing din
1846,BOOK II,"Sweeps down its fathomless whirlpools through the gloom,"
1847,BOOK II,When God with tumult of a mighty storm
1848,BOOK II,"Hath palled the sky in cloud from verge to verge,"
1849,BOOK II,"When thunders crash all round, when thick and fast"
1850,BOOK II,"Gleam lightnings from the huddling clouds, when fields"
1851,BOOK II,"Are flooded as the hissing rain descends,"
1852,BOOK II,And all the air is filled with awful roar
1853,BOOK II,Of torrents pouring down the hill-ravines;
1854,BOOK II,So Memnon toward the shores of Hellespont
1855,BOOK II,"Before him hurled the Argives, following hard"
1856,BOOK II,"Behind them, slaughtering ever.  Many a man"
1857,BOOK II,"Fell in the dust, and left his life in blood"
1858,BOOK II,'Neath Aethiop hands.  Stained was the earth with gore
1859,BOOK II,As Danaans died.  Exulted Memnon's soul
1860,BOOK II,"As on the ranks of foemen ever he rushed,"
1861,BOOK II,And heaped with dead was all the plain of Troy.
1862,BOOK II,And still from fight refrained he not; he hoped
1863,BOOK II,To be a light of safety unto Troy
1864,BOOK II,And bane to Danaans.  But all the while
1865,BOOK II,"Stood baleful Doom beside him, and spurred on"
1866,BOOK II,"To strife, with flattering smile.  To right, to left"
1867,BOOK II,"His stalwart helpers wrought in battle-toil,"
1868,BOOK II,"Alcyoneus and Nychius, and the son"
1869,BOOK II,"Of Asius furious-souled; Meneclus' spear,"
1870,BOOK II,"Clydon and Alexippus, yea, a host"
1871,BOOK II,"Eager to chase the foe, men who in fight"
1872,BOOK II,"Quit them like men, exulting in their king."
1873,BOOK II,"Then, as Meneclus on the Danaans charged,"
1874,BOOK II,"The son of Neleus slew him.  Wroth for his friend,"
1875,BOOK II,Whole throngs of foes fierce-hearted Memnon slew.
1876,BOOK II,As when a hunter midst the mountains drives
1877,BOOK II,Swift deer within the dark lines of his toils--
1878,BOOK II,The eager ring of beaters closing in
1879,BOOK II,Presses the huddled throng into the snares
1880,BOOK II,Of death: the dogs are wild with joy of the chase
1881,BOOK II,"Ceaselessly giving tongue, the while his darts"
1882,BOOK II,Leap winged with death on brocket and on hind;
1883,BOOK II,So Memnon slew and ever slew: his men
1884,BOOK II,"Rejoiced, the while in panic stricken rout"
1885,BOOK II,Before that glorious man the Argives fled.
1886,BOOK II,As when from a steep mountain's precipice-brow
1887,BOOK II,"Leaps a huge crag, which all-resistless Zeus"
1888,BOOK II,By stroke of thunderbolt hath hurled from the crest;
1889,BOOK II,"Crash oakwood copses, echo long ravines,"
1890,BOOK II,"Shudders the forest to its rattle and roar,"
1891,BOOK II,And flocks therein and herds and wild things flee
1892,BOOK II,"Scattering, as bounding, whirling, it descends"
1893,BOOK II,With deadly pitiless onrush; so his foes
1894,BOOK II,Fled from the lightning-flash of Memnon's spear.
1895,BOOK II,
1896,BOOK II,Then to the side of Aeacus' mighty son
1897,BOOK II,Came Nestor.  Anguished for his son he cried:
1898,BOOK II,"""Achilles, thou great bulwark of the Greeks,"
1899,BOOK II,Slain is my child!  The armour of my dead
1900,BOOK II,"Hath Memnon, and I fear me lest his corse"
1901,BOOK II,Be cast a prey to dogs.  Haste to his help!
1902,BOOK II,True friend is he who still remembereth
1903,BOOK II,"A friend though slain, and grieves for one no more."""
1904,BOOK II,
1905,BOOK II,Achilles heard; his heart was thrilled with grief:
1906,BOOK II,"He glanced across the rolling battle, saw"
1907,BOOK II,"Memnon, saw where in throngs the Argives fell"
1908,BOOK II,Beneath his spear.  Forthright he turned away
1909,BOOK II,From where the rifted ranks of Troy fell fast
1910,BOOK II,"Before his hands, and, thirsting for the fight,"
1911,BOOK II,"Wroth for Antilochus and the others slain,"
1912,BOOK II,Came face to face with Memnon.  In his hands
1913,BOOK II,That godlike hero caught up from the ground
1914,BOOK II,"A stone, a boundary-mark 'twixt fields of wheat,"
1915,BOOK II,And hurled.  Down on the shield of Peleus' son
1916,BOOK II,"It crashed.  But he, the invincible, shrank not"
1917,BOOK II,"Before the huge rock-shard, but, thrusting out"
1918,BOOK II,"His long lance, rushed to close with him, afoot,"
1919,BOOK II,For his steeds stayed behind the battle-rout.
1920,BOOK II,On the right shoulder above the shield he smote
1921,BOOK II,"And staggered him; but he, despite the wound,"
1922,BOOK II,Fought on with heart unquailing.  Swiftly he thrust
1923,BOOK II,And pricked with his strong spear Achilles' arm.
1924,BOOK II,Forth gushed the blood: rejoicing with vain joy
1925,BOOK II,To Aeacus' son with arrogant words he cried:
1926,BOOK II,"""Now shalt thou in thy death fill up, I trow,"
1927,BOOK II,"Thy dark doom, overmastered by mine hands."
1928,BOOK II,Thou shalt not from this fray escape alive!
1929,BOOK II,"Fool, wherefore hast thou ruthlessly destroyed"
1930,BOOK II,"Trojans, and vaunted thee the mightiest man"
1931,BOOK II,"Of men, a deathless Nereid's son?  Ha, now"
1932,BOOK II,"Thy doom hath found thee!  Of birth divine am I,"
1933,BOOK II,"The Dawn-queen's mighty son, nurtured afar"
1934,BOOK II,"By lily-slender Hesperid Maids, beside"
1935,BOOK II,The Ocean-river.  Therefore not from thee
1936,BOOK II,"Nor from grim battle shrink I, knowing well"
1937,BOOK II,How far my goddess-mother doth transcend
1938,BOOK II,"A Nereid, whose child thou vauntest thee."
1939,BOOK II,To Gods and men my mother bringeth light;
1940,BOOK II,"On her depends the issue of all things,"
1941,BOOK II,Works great and glorious in Olympus wrought
1942,BOOK II,Whereof comes blessing unto men.  But thine--
1943,BOOK II,She sits in barren crypts of brine: she dwells
1944,BOOK II,"Glorying mid dumb sea-monsters and mid fish,"
1945,BOOK II,"Deedless, unseen!  Nothing I reck of her,"
1946,BOOK II,"Nor rank her with the immortal Heavenly Ones."""
1947,BOOK II,
1948,BOOK II,In stern rebuke spake Aeacus' aweless son:
1949,BOOK II,"""Memnon, how wast thou so distraught of wit"
1950,BOOK II,"That thou shouldst face me, and to fight defy"
1951,BOOK II,"Me, who in might, in blood, in stature far"
1952,BOOK II,Surpass thee?  From supremest Zeus I trace
1953,BOOK II,My glorious birth; and from the strong Sea-god
1954,BOOK II,"Nereus, begetter of the Maids of the Sea,"
1955,BOOK II,"The Nereids, honoured of the Olympian Gods."
1956,BOOK II,"And chiefest of them all is Thetis, wise"
1957,BOOK II,With wisdom world-renowned; for in her bowers
1958,BOOK II,"She sheltered Dionysus, chased by might"
1959,BOOK II,Of murderous Lycurgus from the earth.
1960,BOOK II,"Yea, and the cunning God-smith welcomed she"
1961,BOOK II,"Within her mansion, when from heaven he fell."
1962,BOOK II,"Ay, and the Lightning-lord she once released"
1963,BOOK II,From bonds.  The all-seeing Dwellers in the Sky
1964,BOOK II,"Remember all these things, and reverence"
1965,BOOK II,My mother Thetis in divine Olympus.
1966,BOOK II,"Ay, that she is a Goddess shalt thou know"
1967,BOOK II,When to thine heart the brazen spear shall pierce
1968,BOOK II,Sped by my might.  Patroclus' death I avenged
1969,BOOK II,"On Hector, and Antilochus on thee"
1970,BOOK II,Will I avenge.  No weakling's friend thou hast slain!
1971,BOOK II,But why like witless children stand we here
1972,BOOK II,Babbling our parents' fame and our own deeds?
1973,BOOK II,"Now is the hour when prowess shall decide."""
1974,BOOK II,
1975,BOOK II,"Then from the sheath he flashed his long keen sword,"
1976,BOOK II,And Memnon his; and swiftly in fiery fight
1977,BOOK II,"Closed they, and rained the never-ceasing blows"
1978,BOOK II,Upon the bucklers which with craft divine
1979,BOOK II,Hephaestus' self had fashioned.  Once and again
1980,BOOK II,"Clashed they together, and their cloudy crests"
1981,BOOK II,"Touched, mingling all their tossing storm of hair."
1982,BOOK II,"And Zeus, for that he loved them both, inspired"
1983,BOOK II,"With prowess each, and mightier than their wont"
1984,BOOK II,"He made them, made them tireless, nothing like"
1985,BOOK II,"To men, but Gods: and gloated o'er the twain"
1986,BOOK II,The Queen of Strife.  In eager fury these
1987,BOOK II,"Thrust swiftly out the spear, with fell intent"
1988,BOOK II,"To reach the throat 'twixt buckler-rim and helm,"
1989,BOOK II,"Thrust many a time and oft, and now would aim"
1990,BOOK II,"The point beneath the shield, above the greave,"
1991,BOOK II,Now close beneath the corslet curious-wrought
1992,BOOK II,"That lapped the stalwart frame: hard, fast they lunged,"
1993,BOOK II,And on their shoulders clashed the arms divine.
1994,BOOK II,Roared to the very heavens the battle-shout
1995,BOOK II,"Of warring men, of Trojans, Aethiops,"
1996,BOOK II,"And Argives mighty-hearted, while the dust"
1997,BOOK II,"Rolled up from 'neath their feet, tossed to the sky"
1998,BOOK II,In stress of battle-travail great and strong.
1999,BOOK II,
2000,BOOK II,"As when a mist enshrouds the hills, what time"
2001,BOOK II,"Roll up the rain-clouds, and the torrent-beds"
2002,BOOK II,"Roar as they fill with rushing floods, and howls"
2003,BOOK II,Each gorge with fearful voices; shepherds quake
2004,BOOK II,"To see the waters' downrush and the mist,"
2005,BOOK II,Screen dear to wolves and all the wild fierce things
2006,BOOK II,Nursed in the wide arms of the forest; so
2007,BOOK II,Around the fighters' feet the choking dust
2008,BOOK II,"Hung, hiding the fair splendour of the sun"
2009,BOOK II,And darkening all the heaven.  Sore distressed
2010,BOOK II,With dust and deadly conflict were the folk.
2011,BOOK II,Then with a sudden hand some Blessed One
2012,BOOK II,Swept the dust-pall aside; and the Gods saw
2013,BOOK II,The deadly Fates hurling the charging lines
2014,BOOK II,"Together, in the unending wrestle locked"
2015,BOOK II,"Of that grim conflict, saw where never ceased"
2016,BOOK II,"Ares from hideous slaughter, saw the earth"
2017,BOOK II,"Crimsoned all round with rushing streams of blood,"
2018,BOOK II,"Saw where dark Havoc gloated o'er the scene,"
2019,BOOK II,"Saw the wide plain with corpses heaped, even all"
2020,BOOK II,"Bounded 'twixt Simois and Xanthus, where"
2021,BOOK II,They sweep from Ida down to Hellespont.
2022,BOOK II,
2023,BOOK II,But when long lengthened out the conflict was
2024,BOOK II,"Of those two champions, and the might of both"
2025,BOOK II,"In that strong tug and strain was equal-matched,"
2026,BOOK II,"Then, gazing from Olympus' far-off heights,"
2027,BOOK II,"The Gods joyed, some in the invincible son"
2028,BOOK II,"Of Peleus, others in the goodly child"
2029,BOOK II,Of old Tithonus and the Queen of Dawn.
2030,BOOK II,"Thundered the heavens on high from east to west,"
2031,BOOK II,"And roared the sea from verge to verge, and rocked"
2032,BOOK II,"The dark earth 'neath the heroes' feet, and quaked"
2033,BOOK II,Proud Nereus' daughters all round Thetis thronged
2034,BOOK II,In grievous fear for mighty Achilles' sake;
2035,BOOK II,And trembled for her son the Child of the Mist
2036,BOOK II,As in her chariot through the sky she rode.
2037,BOOK II,"Marvelled the Daughters of the Sun, who stood"
2038,BOOK II,"Near her, around that wondrous splendour-ring"
2039,BOOK II,Traced for the race-course of the tireless sun
2040,BOOK II,"By Zeus, the limit of all Nature's life"
2041,BOOK II,"And death, the dally round that maketh up"
2042,BOOK II,The eternal circuit of the rolling years.
2043,BOOK II,And now amongst the Blessed bitter feud
2044,BOOK II,Had broken out; but by behest of Zeus
2045,BOOK II,"The twin Fates suddenly stood beside these twain,"
2046,BOOK II,One dark--her shadow fell on Memnon's heart;
2047,BOOK II,One bright--her radiance haloed Peleus' son.
2048,BOOK II,"And with a great cry the Immortals saw,"
2049,BOOK II,"And filled with sorrow they of the one part were,"
2050,BOOK II,They of the other with triumphant joy.
2051,BOOK II,
2052,BOOK II,Still in the midst of blood-stained battle-rout
2053,BOOK II,"Those heroes fought, unknowing of the Fates"
2054,BOOK II,"Now drawn so nigh, but each at other hurled"
2055,BOOK II,"His whole heart's courage, all his bodily might."
2056,BOOK II,Thou hadst said that in the strife of that dread day
2057,BOOK II,"Huge tireless Giants or strong Titans warred,"
2058,BOOK II,"So fiercely blazed the wildfire of their strife,"
2059,BOOK II,"Now, when they clashed with swords, now when they leapt"
2060,BOOK II,Hurling huge stones.  Nor either would give back
2061,BOOK II,"Before the hail of blows, nor quailed.  They stood"
2062,BOOK II,"Like storm-tormented headlands steadfast, clothed"
2063,BOOK II,"With might past words, unearthly; for the twain"
2064,BOOK II,Alike could boast their lineage of high Zeus.
2065,BOOK II,Therefore 'twixt these Enyo lengthened out
2066,BOOK II,"The even-balanced strife, while ever they"
2067,BOOK II,"In that grim wrestle strained their uttermost,"
2068,BOOK II,"They and their dauntless comrades, round their kings"
2069,BOOK II,"With ceaseless fury toiling, till their spears"
2070,BOOK II,"Stood shivered all in shields of warriors slain,"
2071,BOOK II,And of the fighters woundless none remained;
2072,BOOK II,But from all limbs streamed down into the dust
2073,BOOK II,The blood and sweat of that unresting strain
2074,BOOK II,"Of fight, and earth was hidden with the dead,"
2075,BOOK II,As heaven is hidden with clouds when meets the sun
2076,BOOK II,"The Goat-star, and the shipman dreads the deep."
2077,BOOK II,"As charged the lines, the snorting chariot-steeds"
2078,BOOK II,"Trampled the dead, as on the myriad leaves"
2079,BOOK II,Ye trample in the woods at entering-in
2080,BOOK II,"Of winter, when the autumn-tide is past."
2081,BOOK II,
2082,BOOK II,Still mid the corpses and the blood fought on
2083,BOOK II,"Those glorious sons of Gods, nor ever ceased"
2084,BOOK II,From wrath of fight.  But Eris now inclined
2085,BOOK II,"The fatal scales of battle, which no more"
2086,BOOK II,Were equal-poised.  Beneath the breast-bone then
2087,BOOK II,Of godlike Memnon plunged Achilles' sword;
2088,BOOK II,Clear through his body all the dark-blue blade
2089,BOOK II,Leapt: suddenly snapped the silver cord of life.
2090,BOOK II,"Down in a pool of blood he fell, and clashed"
2091,BOOK II,"His massy armour, and earth rang again."
2092,BOOK II,"Then turned to flight his comrades panic-struck,"
2093,BOOK II,"And of his arms the Myrmidons stripped the dead,"
2094,BOOK II,"While fled the Trojans, and Achilles chased,"
2095,BOOK II,As whirlwind swift and mighty to destroy.
2096,BOOK II,
2097,BOOK II,"Then groaned the Dawn, and palled herself in clouds,"
2098,BOOK II,And earth was darkened.  At their mother's hest
2099,BOOK II,"All the light Breathings of the Dawn took hands,"
2100,BOOK II,And slid down one long stream of sighing wind
2101,BOOK II,"To Priam's plain, and floated round the dead,"
2102,BOOK II,"And softly, swiftly caught they up, and bare"
2103,BOOK II,"Through silver mists the Dawn-queen's son, with hearts"
2104,BOOK II,"Sore aching for their brother's fall, while moaned"
2105,BOOK II,"Around them all the air.  As on they passed,"
2106,BOOK II,Fell many blood-gouts from those pierced limbs
2107,BOOK II,"Down to the earth, and these were made a sign"
2108,BOOK II,To generations yet to be.  The Gods
2109,BOOK II,"Gathered them up from many lands, and made"
2110,BOOK II,"Thereof a far-resounding river, named"
2111,BOOK II,Of all that dwell beneath long Ida's flanks
2112,BOOK II,Paphlagoneion.  As its waters flow
2113,BOOK II,"'Twixt fertile acres, once a year they turn"
2114,BOOK II,"To blood, when comes the woeful day whereon"
2115,BOOK II,Died Memnon.  Thence a sick and choking reek
2116,BOOK II,Steams: thou wouldst say that from a wound unhealed
2117,BOOK II,Corrupting humours breathed an evil stench.
2118,BOOK II,"Ay, so the Gods ordained: but now flew on"
2119,BOOK II,Bearing Dawn's mighty son the rushing winds
2120,BOOK II,Skimming earth's face and palled about with night.
2121,BOOK II,
2122,BOOK II,Nor were his Aethiopian comrades left
2123,BOOK II,To wander of their King forlorn: a God
2124,BOOK II,Suddenly winged those eager souls with speed
2125,BOOK II,"Such as should soon be theirs for ever, changed"
2126,BOOK II,"To flying fowl, the children of the air."
2127,BOOK II,Wailing their King in the winds' track they sped.
2128,BOOK II,As when a hunter mid the forest-brakes
2129,BOOK II,"Is by a boar or grim-jawed lion slain,"
2130,BOOK II,"And now his sorrowing friends take up the corse,"
2131,BOOK II,And bear it heavy-hearted; and the hounds
2132,BOOK II,"Follow low-whimpering, pining for their lord"
2133,BOOK II,In that disastrous hunting lost; so they
2134,BOOK II,"Left far behind that stricken field of blood,"
2135,BOOK II,And fast they followed after those swift winds
2136,BOOK II,
2137,BOOK II,"With multitudinous moaning, veiled in mist"
2138,BOOK II,Unearthly.  Trojans over all the plain
2139,BOOK II,"And Danaans marvelled, seeing that great host"
2140,BOOK II,Vanishing with their King.  All hearts stood still
2141,BOOK II,In dumb amazement. But the tireless winds
2142,BOOK II,Sighing set hero Memnon's giant corpse
2143,BOOK II,"Down by the deep flow of Aesopus' stream,"
2144,BOOK II,"Where is a fair grove of the bright-haired Nymphs,"
2145,BOOK II,The which round his long barrow afterward
2146,BOOK II,"Aesopus' daughters planted, screening it"
2147,BOOK II,With many and manifold trees: and long and loud
2148,BOOK II,"Wailed those Immortals, chanting his renown,"
2149,BOOK II,The son of the Dawn-goddess splendour-throned.
2150,BOOK II,
2151,BOOK II,Now sank the sun: the Lady of the Morn
2152,BOOK II,Wailing her dear child from the heavens came down.
2153,BOOK II,"Twelve maidens shining-tressed attended her,"
2154,BOOK II,The warders of the high paths of the sun
2155,BOOK II,"For ever circling, warders of the night"
2156,BOOK II,"And dawn, and each world-ordinance framed of Zeus,"
2157,BOOK II,Around whose mansion's everlasting doors
2158,BOOK II,"From east to west they dance, from west to east,"
2159,BOOK II,"Whirling the wheels of harvest-laden years,"
2160,BOOK II,"While rolls the endless round of winter's cold,"
2161,BOOK II,"And flowery spring, and lovely summer-tide,"
2162,BOOK II,And heavy-clustered autumn.  These came down
2163,BOOK II,"From heaven, for Memnon wailing wild and high;"
2164,BOOK II,And mourned with these the Pleiads.  Echoed round
2165,BOOK II,"Far-stretching mountains, and Aesopus' stream."
2166,BOOK II,"Ceaseless uprose the keen, and in their midst,"
2167,BOOK II,"Fallen on her son and clasping, wailed the Dawn;"
2168,BOOK II,"""Dead art thou, dear, dear child, and thou hast clad"
2169,BOOK II,"Thy mother with a pall of grief.  Oh, I,"
2170,BOOK II,"Now thou art slain, will not endure to light"
2171,BOOK II,"The Immortal Heavenly Ones!  No, I will plunge"
2172,BOOK II,"Down to the dread depths of the underworld,"
2173,BOOK II,"Where thy lone spirit flitteth to and fro,"
2174,BOOK II,"And will to blind night leave earth, sky, and sea,"
2175,BOOK II,"Till Chaos and formless darkness brood o'er all,"
2176,BOOK II,That Cronos' Son may also learn what means
2177,BOOK II,Anguish of heart.  For not less worship-worthy
2178,BOOK II,"Than Nereus' Child, by Zeus's ordinance,"
2179,BOOK II,"Am I, who look on all things, I, who bring"
2180,BOOK II,All to their consummation.  Recklessly
2181,BOOK II,My light Zeus now despiseth!  Therefore I
2182,BOOK II,Will pass into the darkness.  Let him bring
2183,BOOK II,Up to Olympus Thetis from the sea
2184,BOOK II,To hold for him light forth to Gods and men!
2185,BOOK II,"My sad soul loveth darkness more than day,"
2186,BOOK II,Lest I pour light upon thy slayer's head:
2187,BOOK II,
2188,BOOK II,"Thus as she cried, the tears ran down her face"
2189,BOOK II,"Immortal, like a river brimming aye:"
2190,BOOK II,Drenched was the dark earth round the corse.  The Night
2191,BOOK II,"Grieved in her daughter's anguish, and the heaven"
2192,BOOK II,Drew over all his stars a veil of mist
2193,BOOK II,"And cloud, of love unto the Lady of Light."
2194,BOOK II,
2195,BOOK II,Meanwhile within their walls the Trojan folk
2196,BOOK II,"For Memnon sorrowed sore, with vain regret"
2197,BOOK II,Yearning for that lost king and all his host.
2198,BOOK II,"Nor greatly joyed the Argives, where they lay"
2199,BOOK II,Camped in the open plain amidst the dead.
2200,BOOK II,"There, mingled with Achilles' praise, uprose"
2201,BOOK II,Wails for Antilochus: joy clasped hands with grief.
2202,BOOK II,
2203,BOOK II,All night in groans and sighs most pitiful
2204,BOOK II,The Dawn-queen lay: a sea of darkness moaned
2205,BOOK II,Around her.  Of the dayspring nought she recked:
2206,BOOK II,She loathed Olympus' spaces.  At her side
2207,BOOK II,"Fretted and whinnied still her fleetfoot steeds,"
2208,BOOK II,"Trampling the strange earth, gazing at their Queen"
2209,BOOK II,"Grief-stricken, yearning for the fiery course."
2210,BOOK II,Suddenly crashed the thunder of the wrath
2211,BOOK II,"Of Zeus; rocked round her all the shuddering earth,"
2212,BOOK II,And on immortal Eos trembling came.
2213,BOOK II,
2214,BOOK II,Swiftly the dark-skinned Aethiops from her sight
2215,BOOK II,Buried their lord lamenting.  As they wailed
2216,BOOK II,"Unceasingly, the Dawn-queen lovely-eyed"
2217,BOOK II,Changed them to birds sweeping through air around
2218,BOOK II,The barrow of the mighty dead.  And these
2219,BOOK II,"Still do the tribes of men ""The Memnons"" call;"
2220,BOOK II,And still with wailing cries they dart and wheel
2221,BOOK II,"Above their king's tomb, and they scatter dust"
2222,BOOK II,"Down on his grave, still shrill the battle-cry,"
2223,BOOK II,"In memory of Memnon, each to each."
2224,BOOK II,"But he in Hades' mansions, or perchance"
2225,BOOK II,"Amid the Blessed on the Elysian Plain,"
2226,BOOK II,Laugheth.  Divine Dawn comforteth her heart
2227,BOOK II,Beholding them: but theirs is toil of strife
2228,BOOK II,"Unending, till the weary victors strike"
2229,BOOK II,"The vanquished dead, or one and all fill up"
2230,BOOK II,The measure of their doom around his grave.
2231,BOOK II,
2232,BOOK II,"So by command of Eos, Lady of Light,"
2233,BOOK II,The swift birds dree their weird.  But Dawn divine
2234,BOOK II,"Now heavenward soared with the all-fostering Hours,"
2235,BOOK II,"Who drew her to Zeus' threshold, sorely loth,"
2236,BOOK II,"Yet conquered by their gentle pleadings, such"
2237,BOOK II,As salve the bitterest grief of broken hearts.
2238,BOOK II,"Nor the Dawn-queen forgat her daily course,"
2239,BOOK II,"But quailed before the unbending threat of Zeus,"
2240,BOOK II,"Of whom are all things, even all comprised"
2241,BOOK II,"Within the encircling sweep of Ocean's stream,"
2242,BOOK II,Earth and the palace-dome of burning stars.
2243,BOOK II,"Before her went her Pleiad-harbingers,"
2244,BOOK II,"Then she herself flung wide the ethereal gates,"
2245,BOOK II,"And, scattering spray of splendour, flashed there-through."
2246,BOOK II,
2247,BOOK II,
2248,BOOK II,
2249,BOOK III,BOOK III
2250,BOOK III,
2251,BOOK III,How by the shaft of a God laid low was Hero Achilles.
2252,BOOK III,
2253,BOOK III,
2254,BOOK III,"When shone the light of Dawn the splendour-throned,"
2255,BOOK III,Then to the ships the Pylian spearmen bore
2256,BOOK III,"Antilochus' corpse, sore sighing for their prince,"
2257,BOOK III,And by the Hellespont they buried him
2258,BOOK III,With aching hearts.  Around him groaning stood
2259,BOOK III,"The battle-eager sons of Argives, all,"
2260,BOOK III,"Of love for Nestor, shrouded o'er with grief."
2261,BOOK III,But that grey hero's heart was nowise crushed
2262,BOOK III,By sorrow; for the wise man's soul endures
2263,BOOK III,"Bravely, and cowers not under affliction's stroke."
2264,BOOK III,"But Peleus' son, wroth for Antilochus"
2265,BOOK III,"His dear friend, armed for vengeance terrible"
2266,BOOK III,"Upon the Trojans.  Yea, and these withal,"
2267,BOOK III,"Despite their dread of mighty Achilles' spear,"
2268,BOOK III,"Poured battle-eager forth their gates, for now"
2269,BOOK III,"The Fates with courage filled their breasts, of whom"
2270,BOOK III,"Many were doomed to Hades to descend,"
2271,BOOK III,"Whence there is no return, thrust down by hands"
2272,BOOK III,"Of Aeacus' son, who also was foredoomed"
2273,BOOK III,To perish that same day by Priam's wall.
2274,BOOK III,Swift met the fronts of conflict: all the tribes
2275,BOOK III,"Of Troy's host, and the battle-biding Greeks,"
2276,BOOK III,Afire with that new-kindled fury of war.
2277,BOOK III,
2278,BOOK III,Then through the foe the son of Peleus made
2279,BOOK III,Wide havoc: all around the earth was drenched
2280,BOOK III,"With gore, and choked with corpses were the streams"
2281,BOOK III,"Of Simois and Xanthus.  Still he chased,"
2282,BOOK III,"Still slaughtered, even to the city's walls;"
2283,BOOK III,For panic fell on all the host.  And now
2284,BOOK III,"All had he slain, had dashed the gates to earth,"
2285,BOOK III,"Rending them from their hinges, or the bolts,"
2286,BOOK III,"Hurling himself against them, had he snapped,"
2287,BOOK III,And for the Danaans into Priam's burg
2288,BOOK III,"Had made a way, had utterly destroyed"
2289,BOOK III,That goodly town--but now was Phoebus wroth
2290,BOOK III,"Against him with grim fury, when he saw"
2291,BOOK III,Those countless troops of heroes slain of him.
2292,BOOK III,Down from Olympus with a lion-leap
2293,BOOK III,"He came: his quiver on his shoulders lay,"
2294,BOOK III,And shafts that deal the wounds incurable.
2295,BOOK III,Facing Achilles stood he; round him clashed
2296,BOOK III,Quiver and arrows; blazed with quenchless flame
2297,BOOK III,"His eyes, and shook the earth beneath his feet."
2298,BOOK III,"Then with a terrible shout the great God cried,"
2299,BOOK III,So to turn back from war Achilles awed
2300,BOOK III,"By the voice divine, and save from death the Trojans:"
2301,BOOK III,"""Back from the Trojans, Peleus' son!  Beseems not"
2302,BOOK III,"That longer thou deal death unto thy foes,"
2303,BOOK III,"Lest an Olympian God abase thy pride."""
2304,BOOK III,
2305,BOOK III,But nothing quailed the hero at the voice
2306,BOOK III,"Immortal, for that round him even now"
2307,BOOK III,Hovered the unrelenting Fates.  He recked
2308,BOOK III,"Naught of the God, and shouted his defiance."
2309,BOOK III,"""Phoebus, why dost thou in mine own despite"
2310,BOOK III,"Stir me to fight with Gods, and wouldst protect"
2311,BOOK III,The arrogant Trojans?  Heretofore hast thou
2312,BOOK III,"By thy beguiling turned me from the fray,"
2313,BOOK III,When from destruction thou at the first didst save
2314,BOOK III,"Hector, whereat the Trojans all through Troy"
2315,BOOK III,"Exulted.  Nay, thou get thee back: return"
2316,BOOK III,"Unto the mansion of the Blessed, lest"
2317,BOOK III,"I smite thee--ay, immortal though thou be!"""
2318,BOOK III,
2319,BOOK III,"Then on the God he turned his back, and sped"
2320,BOOK III,"After the Trojans fleeing cityward,"
2321,BOOK III,And harried still their flight; but wroth at heart
2322,BOOK III,Thus Phoebus spake to his indignant soul:
2323,BOOK III,"""Out on this man!  he is sense-bereft!  But now"
2324,BOOK III,Not Zeus himself nor any other Power
2325,BOOK III,"Shall save this madman who defies the Gods!"""
2326,BOOK III,
2327,BOOK III,"From mortal sight he vanished into cloud,"
2328,BOOK III,And cloaked with mist a baleful shaft he shot
2329,BOOK III,Which leapt to Achilles' ankle: sudden pangs
2330,BOOK III,With mortal sickness made his whole heart faint.
2331,BOOK III,"He reeled, and like a tower he fell, that falls"
2332,BOOK III,Smit by a whirlwind when an earthquake cleaves
2333,BOOK III,A chasm for rushing blasts from underground;
2334,BOOK III,So fell the goodly form of Aeacus' son.
2335,BOOK III,"He glared, a murderous glance, to right, to left,"
2336,BOOK III,"[Upon the Trojans, and a terrible threat]"
2337,BOOK III,"Shouted, a threat that could not be fulfilled:"
2338,BOOK III,"""Who shot at me a stealthy-smiting shaft?"
2339,BOOK III,Let him but dare to meet me face to face!
2340,BOOK III,So shall his blood and all his bowels gush out
2341,BOOK III,"About my spear, and he be hellward sped!"
2342,BOOK III,I know that none can meet me man to man
2343,BOOK III,"And quell in fight--of earth-born heroes none,"
2344,BOOK III,Though such an one should bear within his breast
2345,BOOK III,"A heart unquailing, and have thews of brass."
2346,BOOK III,But dastards still in stealthy ambush lurk
2347,BOOK III,For lives of heroes.  Let him face me then!--
2348,BOOK III,Ay! though he be a God whose anger burns
2349,BOOK III,"Against the Danaans!  Yea, mine heart forebodes"
2350,BOOK III,"That this my smiter was Apollo, cloaked"
2351,BOOK III,In deadly darkness.  So in days gone by
2352,BOOK III,My mother told me how that by his shafts
2353,BOOK III,I was to die before the Scaean Gates
2354,BOOK III,"A piteous death.  Her words were not vain words."""
2355,BOOK III,
2356,BOOK III,Then with unflinching hands from out the wound
2357,BOOK III,Incurable he drew the deadly shaft
2358,BOOK III,In agonized pain.  Forth gushed the blood; his heart
2359,BOOK III,Waxed faint beneath the shadow of coming doom.
2360,BOOK III,Then in indignant wrath he hurled from him
2361,BOOK III,"The arrow: a sudden gust of wind swept by,"
2362,BOOK III,"And caught it up, and, even as he trod"
2363,BOOK III,"Zeus' threshold, to Apollo gave it back;"
2364,BOOK III,"For it beseemed not that a shaft divine,"
2365,BOOK III,"Sped forth by an Immortal, should be lost."
2366,BOOK III,"He unto high Olympus swiftly came,"
2367,BOOK III,"To the great gathering of immortal Gods,"
2368,BOOK III,"Where all assembled watched the war of men,"
2369,BOOK III,"These longing for the Trojans' triumph, those"
2370,BOOK III,For Danaan victory; so with diverse wills
2371,BOOK III,"Watched they the strife, the slayers and the slain."
2372,BOOK III,
2373,BOOK III,"Him did the Bride of Zeus behold, and straight"
2374,BOOK III,Upbraided with exceeding bitter words:
2375,BOOK III,"""What deed of outrage, Phoebus, hast thou done"
2376,BOOK III,"This day, forgetful of that day whereon"
2377,BOOK III,To godlike Peleus' spousals gathered all
2378,BOOK III,"The Immortals?  Yea, amidst the feasters thou"
2379,BOOK III,Sangest how Thetis silver-footed left
2380,BOOK III,The sea's abysses to be Peleus' bride;
2381,BOOK III,And as thou harpedst all earth's children came
2382,BOOK III,"To hearken, beasts and birds, high craggy hills,"
2383,BOOK III,"Rivers, and all deep-shadowed forests came."
2384,BOOK III,"All this hast thou forgotten, and hast wrought"
2385,BOOK III,"A ruthless deed, hast slain a godlike man,"
2386,BOOK III,Albeit thou with other Gods didst pour
2387,BOOK III,"The nectar, praying that he might be the son"
2388,BOOK III,By Thetis given to Peleus.  But that prayer
2389,BOOK III,"Hast thou forgotten, favouring the folk"
2390,BOOK III,"Of tyrannous Laomedon, whose kine"
2391,BOOK III,"Thou keptest.  He, a mortal, did despite"
2392,BOOK III,"To thee, the deathless!  O, thou art wit-bereft!"
2393,BOOK III,"Thou favourest Troy, thy sufferings all forgot."
2394,BOOK III,"Thou wretch, and doth thy false heart know not this,"
2395,BOOK III,"What man is an offence, and meriteth"
2396,BOOK III,"Suffering, and who is honoured of the Gods?"
2397,BOOK III,"Ever Achilles showed us reverence--yea,"
2398,BOOK III,"Was of our race.  Ha, but the punishment"
2399,BOOK III,"Of Troy, I ween, shall not be lighter, though"
2400,BOOK III,Aeacus' son have fallen; for his son
2401,BOOK III,Right soon shall come from Scyros to the war
2402,BOOK III,"To help the Argive men, no less in might"
2403,BOOK III,"Than was his sire, a bane to many a foe."
2404,BOOK III,"But thou--thou for the Trojans dost not care,"
2405,BOOK III,"But for his valour enviedst Peleus' son,"
2406,BOOK III,Seeing he was the mightest of all men.
2407,BOOK III,"Thou fool!  how wilt thou meet the Nereid's eyes,"
2408,BOOK III,"When she shall stand in Zeus' hall midst the Gods,"
2409,BOOK III,"Who praised thee once, and loved as her own son?"""
2410,BOOK III,
2411,BOOK III,"So Hera spake, in bitterness of soul"
2412,BOOK III,"Upbraiding, but he answered her not a word,"
2413,BOOK III,Of reverence for his mighty Father's bride;
2414,BOOK III,"Nor could he lift his eyes to meet her eyes,"
2415,BOOK III,"But sat abashed, aloof from all the Gods"
2416,BOOK III,"Eternal, while in unforgiving wrath"
2417,BOOK III,Scowled on him all the Immortals who maintained
2418,BOOK III,The Danaans' cause; but such as fain would bring
2419,BOOK III,"Triumph to Troy, these with exultant hearts"
2420,BOOK III,"Extolled him, hiding it from Hera's eyes,"
2421,BOOK III,Before whose wrath all Heaven-abiders shrank.
2422,BOOK III,
2423,BOOK III,But Peleus' son the while forgat not yet
2424,BOOK III,War's fury: still in his invincible limbs
2425,BOOK III,"The hot blood throbbed, and still he longed for fight."
2426,BOOK III,Was none of all the Trojans dared draw nigh
2427,BOOK III,"The stricken hero, but at distance stood,"
2428,BOOK III,As round a wounded lion hunters stand
2429,BOOK III,"Mid forest-brakes afraid, and, though the shaft"
2430,BOOK III,"Stands in his heart, yet faileth not in him"
2431,BOOK III,"His royal courage, but with terrible glare"
2432,BOOK III,"Roll his fierce eyes, and roar his grimly jaws;"
2433,BOOK III,So wrath and anguish of his deadly hurt
2434,BOOK III,To fury stung Peleides' soul; but aye
2435,BOOK III,His strength ebbed through the god-envenomed wound.
2436,BOOK III,"Yet leapt he up, and rushed upon the foe,"
2437,BOOK III,And flashed the lightning of his lance; it slew
2438,BOOK III,"The goodly Orythaon, comrade stout"
2439,BOOK III,"Of Hector, through his temples crashing clear:"
2440,BOOK III,His helm stayed not the long lance fury-sped
2441,BOOK III,"Which leapt therethrough, and won within the bones"
2442,BOOK III,"The heart of the brain, and spilt his lusty life."
2443,BOOK III,Then stabbed he 'neath the brow Hipponous
2444,BOOK III,"Even to the eye-roots, that the eyeball fell"
2445,BOOK III,To earth: his soul to Hades flitted forth.
2446,BOOK III,"Then through the jaw he pierced Alcathous,"
2447,BOOK III,And shore away his tongue: in dust he fell
2448,BOOK III,"Gasping his life out, and the spear-head shot"
2449,BOOK III,"Out through his ear.  These, as they rushed on him,"
2450,BOOK III,That hero slew; but many a fleer's life
2451,BOOK III,"He spilt, for in his heart still leapt the blood."
2452,BOOK III,
2453,BOOK III,"But when his limbs grew chill, and ebbed away"
2454,BOOK III,"His spirit, leaning on his spear he stood,"
2455,BOOK III,While still the Trojans fled in huddled rout
2456,BOOK III,"Of panic, and he shouted unto them:"
2457,BOOK III,"""Trojan and Dardan cravens, ye shall not"
2458,BOOK III,"Even in my death, escape my merciless spear,"
2459,BOOK III,But unto mine Avenging Spirits ye
2460,BOOK III,"Shall pay--ay, one and all--destruction's debt!"""
2461,BOOK III,
2462,BOOK III,He spake; they heard and quailed: as mid the hills
2463,BOOK III,"Fawns tremble at a lion's deep-mouthed roar,"
2464,BOOK III,"And terror-stricken flee the monster, so"
2465,BOOK III,"The ranks of Trojan chariot-lords, the lines"
2466,BOOK III,"Of battle-helpers drawn from alien lands,"
2467,BOOK III,"Quailed at the last shout of Achilles, deemed"
2468,BOOK III,That he was woundless yet.  But 'neath the weight
2469,BOOK III,"Of doom his aweless heart, his mighty limbs,"
2470,BOOK III,At last were overborne.  Down midst the dead
2471,BOOK III,"He fell, as fails a beetling mountain-cliff."
2472,BOOK III,Earth rang beneath him: clanged with a thundercrash
2473,BOOK III,"His arms, as Peleus' son the princely fell."
2474,BOOK III,And still his foes with most exceeding dread
2475,BOOK III,"Stared at him, even as, when some murderous beast"
2476,BOOK III,"Lies slain by shepherds, tremble still the sheep"
2477,BOOK III,"Eyeing him, as beside the fold he lies,"
2478,BOOK III,"And shrinking, as they pass him, far aloof"
2479,BOOK III,"And, even as he were living, fear him dead;"
2480,BOOK III,"So feared they him, Achilles now no more."
2481,BOOK III,
2482,BOOK III,Yet Paris strove to kindle those faint hearts;
2483,BOOK III,"For his own heart exulted, and he hoped,"
2484,BOOK III,"Now Peleus' son, the Danaans' strength, had fallen,"
2485,BOOK III,Wholly to quench the Argive battle-fire:
2486,BOOK III,"""Friends, if ye help me truly and loyally,"
2487,BOOK III,"Let us this day die, slain by Argive men,"
2488,BOOK III,"Or live, and hale to Troy with Hector's steeds"
2489,BOOK III,"In triumph Peleus' son thus fallen dead,"
2490,BOOK III,"The steeds that, grieving, yearning for their lord"
2491,BOOK III,To fight have borne me since my brother died.
2492,BOOK III,"Might we with these but hale Achilles slain,"
2493,BOOK III,"Glory were this for Hector's horses, yea,"
2494,BOOK III,For Hector--if in Hades men have sense
2495,BOOK III,Of righteous retribution.  This man aye
2496,BOOK III,Devised but mischief for the sons of Troy;
2497,BOOK III,And now Troy's daughters with exultant hearts
2498,BOOK III,"From all the city streets shall gather round,"
2499,BOOK III,"As pantheresses wroth for stolen cubs,"
2500,BOOK III,"Or lionesses, might stand around a man"
2501,BOOK III,Whose craft in hunting vexed them while he lived.
2502,BOOK III,So round Achilles--a dead corpse at last!--
2503,BOOK III,In hurrying throngs Troy's daughters then shall come
2504,BOOK III,"In unforgiving, unforgetting hate,"
2505,BOOK III,"For parents wroth, for husbands slain, for sons,"
2506,BOOK III,For noble kinsmen.  Most of all shall joy
2507,BOOK III,"My father, and the ancient men, whose feet"
2508,BOOK III,Unwillingly are chained within the walls
2509,BOOK III,"By eld, if we shall hale him through our gates,"
2510,BOOK III,"And give our foe to fowls of the air for meat."""
2511,BOOK III,
2512,BOOK III,"Then they, which feared him theretofore, in haste"
2513,BOOK III,"Closed round the corpse of strong-heart Aeacus' son,"
2514,BOOK III,"Glaucus, Aeneas, battle-fain Agenor,"
2515,BOOK III,"And other cunning men in deadly fight,"
2516,BOOK III,Eager to hale him thence to Ilium
2517,BOOK III,The god-built burg.  But Aias failed him not.
2518,BOOK III,Swiftly that godlike man bestrode the dead:
2519,BOOK III,Back from the corpse his long lance thrust them all.
2520,BOOK III,"Yet ceased they not from onslaught; thronging round,"
2521,BOOK III,"Still with swift rushes fought they for the prize,"
2522,BOOK III,"One following other, like to long-lipped bees"
2523,BOOK III,Which hover round their hive in swarms on swarms
2524,BOOK III,"To drive a man thence; but he, recking naught"
2525,BOOK III,"Of all their fury, carveth out the combs"
2526,BOOK III,Of nectarous honey: harassed sore are they
2527,BOOK III,By smoke-reek and the robber; spite of all
2528,BOOK III,Ever they dart against him; naught cares he;
2529,BOOK III,So naught of all their onsets Aias recked;
2530,BOOK III,"But first he stabbed Agelaus in the breast,"
2531,BOOK III,And slew that son of Maion: Thestor next:
2532,BOOK III,"Ocythous he smote, Agestratus,"
2533,BOOK III,"Aganippus, Zorus, Nessus, Erymas"
2534,BOOK III,"The war-renowned, who came from Lycia-land"
2535,BOOK III,"With mighty-hearted Glaucus, from his home"
2536,BOOK III,"In Melanippion on the mountain-ridge,"
2537,BOOK III,"Athena's fane, which Massikyton fronts"
2538,BOOK III,"Anigh Chelidonia's headland, dreaded sore"
2539,BOOK III,"Of scared seafarers, when its lowering crags"
2540,BOOK III,Must needs be doubled.  For his death the blood
2541,BOOK III,Of famed Hippolochus' son was horror-chilled;
2542,BOOK III,For this was his dear friend.  With one swift thrust
2543,BOOK III,"He pierced the sevenfold hides of Aias' shield,"
2544,BOOK III,Yet touched his flesh not; stayed the spear-head was
2545,BOOK III,By those thick hides and by the corset-plate
2546,BOOK III,Which lapped his battle-tireless limbs.  But still
2547,BOOK III,"From that stern conflict Glaucus drew not back,"
2548,BOOK III,"Burning to vanquish Aias, Aeacus' son,"
2549,BOOK III,And in his folly vaunting threatened him:
2550,BOOK III,"""Aias, men name thee mightiest man of all"
2551,BOOK III,"The Argives, hold thee in passing-high esteem"
2552,BOOK III,"Even as Achilles: therefore thou, I wot,"
2553,BOOK III,"By that dead warrior dead this day shalt lie!"""
2554,BOOK III,
2555,BOOK III,"So hurled he forth a vain word, knowing not"
2556,BOOK III,How far in might above him was the man
2557,BOOK III,Whom his spear threatened.  Battle-bider Aias
2558,BOOK III,"Darkly and scornfully glaring on him, said"
2559,BOOK III,"""Thou craven wretch, and knowest thou not this,"
2560,BOOK III,How much was Hector mightier than thou
2561,BOOK III,"In war-craft?  yet before my might, my spear,"
2562,BOOK III,"He shrank.  Ay, with his valour was there blent"
2563,BOOK III,"Discretion.  Thou thy thoughts are deathward set,"
2564,BOOK III,"Who dar'st defy me to the battle, me,"
2565,BOOK III,A mightier far than thou!  Thou canst not say
2566,BOOK III,That friendship of our fathers thee shall screen;
2567,BOOK III,Nor me thy gifts shall wile to let thee pass
2568,BOOK III,"Scatheless from war, as once did Tydeus' son."
2569,BOOK III,"Though thou didst 'scape his fury, will not I"
2570,BOOK III,Suffer thee to return alive from war.
2571,BOOK III,"Ha, in thy many helpers dost thou trust"
2572,BOOK III,"Who with thee, like so many worthless flies,"
2573,BOOK III,Flit round the noble Achilles' corpse?  To these
2574,BOOK III,"Death and black doom shall my swift onset deal."""
2575,BOOK III,
2576,BOOK III,"Then on the Trojans this way and that he turned,"
2577,BOOK III,As mid long forest-glens a lion turns
2578,BOOK III,"On hounds, and Trojans many and Lycians slew"
2579,BOOK III,"That came for honour hungry, till he stood"
2580,BOOK III,Mid a wide ring of flinchers; like a shoal
2581,BOOK III,Of darting fish when sails into their midst
2582,BOOK III,"Dolphin or shark, a huge sea-fosterling;"
2583,BOOK III,"So shrank they from the might of Telamon's son,"
2584,BOOK III,As aye he charged amidst the rout.  But still
2585,BOOK III,"Swarmed fighters up, till round Achilles' corse"
2586,BOOK III,"To right, to left, lay in the dust the slain"
2587,BOOK III,"Countless, as boars around a lion at bay;"
2588,BOOK III,And evermore the strife waxed deadlier.
2589,BOOK III,Then too Hippolochus' war-wise son was slain
2590,BOOK III,By Aias of the heart of fire.  He fell
2591,BOOK III,"Backward upon Achilles, even as falls"
2592,BOOK III,A sapling on a sturdy mountain-oak;
2593,BOOK III,So quelled by the spear on Peleus' son he fell.
2594,BOOK III,But for his rescue Anchises' stalwart son
2595,BOOK III,"Strove hard, with all his comrades battle-fain,"
2596,BOOK III,"And haled the corse forth, and to sorrowing friends"
2597,BOOK III,"Gave it, to bear to Ilium's hallowed burg."
2598,BOOK III,"Himself to spoil Achilles still fought on,"
2599,BOOK III,Till warrior Aias pierced him with the spear
2600,BOOK III,Through the right forearm.  Swiftly leapt he back
2601,BOOK III,"From murderous war, and hasted thence to Troy."
2602,BOOK III,"There for his healing cunning leeches wrought,"
2603,BOOK III,"Who stanched the blood-rush, and laid on the gash"
2604,BOOK III,"Balms, such as salve war-stricken warriors' pangs."
2605,BOOK III,
2606,BOOK III,"But Aias still fought on: here, there he slew"
2607,BOOK III,With thrusts like lightning-flashes.  His great heart
2608,BOOK III,Ached sorely for his mighty cousin slain.
2609,BOOK III,And now the warrior-king Laertes' son
2610,BOOK III,"Fought at his side: before him blenched the foe,"
2611,BOOK III,"As he smote down Peisander's fleetfoot son,"
2612,BOOK III,"The warrior Maenalus, who left his home"
2613,BOOK III,In far-renowned Abydos: down on him
2614,BOOK III,"He hurled Atymnius, the goodly son"
2615,BOOK III,Whom Pegasis the bright-haired Nymph had borne
2616,BOOK III,To strong Emathion by Granicus' stream.
2617,BOOK III,"Dead by his side he laid Orestius' son,"
2618,BOOK III,"Proteus, who dwelt 'neath lofty Ida's folds."
2619,BOOK III,"Ah, never did his mother welcome home"
2620,BOOK III,"That son from war, Panaceia beauty-famed!"
2621,BOOK III,"He fell by Odysseus' hands, who spilt the lives"
2622,BOOK III,Of many more whom his death-hungering spear
2623,BOOK III,Reached in that fight around the mighty dead.
2624,BOOK III,"Yet Alcon, son of Megacles battle-swift,"
2625,BOOK III,Hard by Odysseus' right knee drave the spear
2626,BOOK III,"Home, and about the glittering greave the blood"
2627,BOOK III,"Dark-crimson welled.  He recked not of the wound,"
2628,BOOK III,But was unto his smiter sudden death;
2629,BOOK III,For clear through his shield he stabbed him with his spear
2630,BOOK III,Amidst his battle-fury: to the earth
2631,BOOK III,Backward he dashed him by his giant might
2632,BOOK III,And strength of hand: clashed round him in the dust
2633,BOOK III,"His armour, and his corslet was distained"
2634,BOOK III,With crimson life-blood.  Forth from flesh and shield
2635,BOOK III,The hero plucked the spear of death: the soul
2636,BOOK III,"Followed the lance-head from the body forth,"
2637,BOOK III,And life forsook its mortal mansion.  Then
2638,BOOK III,"Rushed on his comrades, in his wound's despite,"
2639,BOOK III,"Odysseus, nor from that stern battle-toil"
2640,BOOK III,Refrained him.  And by this a mingled host
2641,BOOK III,Of Danaans eager-hearted fought around
2642,BOOK III,"The mighty dead, and many and many a foe"
2643,BOOK III,Slew they with those smooth-shafted ashen spears.
2644,BOOK III,Even as the winds strew down upon the ground
2645,BOOK III,"The flying leaves, when through the forest-glades"
2646,BOOK III,"Sweep the wild gusts, as waneth autumn-tide,"
2647,BOOK III,And the old year is dying; so the spears
2648,BOOK III,"Of dauntless Danaans strewed the earth with slain,"
2649,BOOK III,"For loyal to dead Achilles were they all,"
2650,BOOK III,And loyal to hero Aias to the death.
2651,BOOK III,For like black Doom he blasted the ranks of Troy.
2652,BOOK III,Then against Aias Paris strained his bow;
2653,BOOK III,"But he was ware thereof, and sped a stone"
2654,BOOK III,Swift to the archer's head: that bolt of death
2655,BOOK III,"Crashed through his crested helm, and darkness closed"
2656,BOOK III,Round him.  In dust down fell he: naught availed
2657,BOOK III,"His shafts their eager lord, this way and that"
2658,BOOK III,"Scattered in dust: empty his quiver lay,"
2659,BOOK III,Flew from his hand the bow.  In haste his friends
2660,BOOK III,"Upcaught him from the earth, and Hector's steeds"
2661,BOOK III,"Hurried him thence to Troy, scarce drawing breath,"
2662,BOOK III,And moaning in his pain.  Nor left his men
2663,BOOK III,"The weapons of their lord, but gathered up"
2664,BOOK III,"All from the plain, and bare them to the prince;"
2665,BOOK III,While Aias after him sent a wrathful shout:
2666,BOOK III,"""Dog, thou hast 'scaped the heavy hand of death"
2667,BOOK III,To-day!  But swiftly thy last hour shall come
2668,BOOK III,"By some strong Argive's hands, or by mine own,"
2669,BOOK III,"But now have I a nobler task in hand,"
2670,BOOK III,"From murder's grip to rescue Achilles' corse."""
2671,BOOK III,"Then turned he on the foe, hurling swift doom"
2672,BOOK III,On such as fought around Peleides yet.
2673,BOOK III,'These saw how many yielded up the ghost
2674,BOOK III,"Neath his strong hands, and, with hearts failing them"
2675,BOOK III,"For fear, against him could they stand no more."
2676,BOOK III,"As rascal vultures were they, which the swoop"
2677,BOOK III,"Of an eagle, king of birds, scares far away"
2678,BOOK III,From carcasses of sheep that wolves have torn;
2679,BOOK III,"So this way, that way scattered they before"
2680,BOOK III,"The hurtling stones, the sword, the might of Aias."
2681,BOOK III,"In utter panic from the war they fled,"
2682,BOOK III,"In huddled rout, like starlings from the swoop"
2683,BOOK III,"Of a death-dealing hawk, when, fleeing bane,"
2684,BOOK III,"One drives against another, as they dart"
2685,BOOK III,All terror-huddled in tumultuous flight.
2686,BOOK III,So from the war to Priam's burg they fled
2687,BOOK III,"Wretchedly clad with terror as a cloak,"
2688,BOOK III,"Quailing from mighty Aias' battle-shout,"
2689,BOOK III,As with hands dripping blood-gouts he pursued.
2690,BOOK III,"Yea, all, one after other, had he slain,"
2691,BOOK III,Had they not streamed through city-gates flung wide
2692,BOOK III,"Hard-panting, pierced to the very heart with fear."
2693,BOOK III,"Pent therewithin he left them, as a shepherd"
2694,BOOK III,"Leaves folded sheep, and strode back o'er the plain;"
2695,BOOK III,"Yet never touched he with his feet the ground,"
2696,BOOK III,"But aye he trod on dead men, arms, and blood;"
2697,BOOK III,For countless corpses lay o'er that wide stretch
2698,BOOK III,"Even from broad-wayed Troy to Hellespont,"
2699,BOOK III,"Bodies of strong men slain, the spoil of Doom."
2700,BOOK III,As when the dense stalks of sun-ripened corn
2701,BOOK III,"Fall 'neath the reapers' hands, and the long swaths,"
2702,BOOK III,"Heavy with full ears, overspread the field,"
2703,BOOK III,And joys the heart of him who oversees
2704,BOOK III,"The toil, lord of the harvest; even so,"
2705,BOOK III,"By baleful havoc overmastered, lay"
2706,BOOK III,All round face-downward men remembering not
2707,BOOK III,The death-denouncing war-shout.  But the sons
2708,BOOK III,Of fair Achaea left their slaughtered foes
2709,BOOK III,In dust and blood unstripped of arms awhile
2710,BOOK III,Till they should lay upon the pyre the son
2711,BOOK III,"Of Peleus, who in battle-shock had been"
2712,BOOK III,"Their banner of victory, charging in his might."
2713,BOOK III,So the kings drew him from that stricken field
2714,BOOK III,"Straining beneath the weight of giant limbs,"
2715,BOOK III,"And with all loving care they bore him on,"
2716,BOOK III,And laid him in his tent before the ships.
2717,BOOK III,"And round him gathered that great host, and wailed"
2718,BOOK III,"Heart-anguished him who had been the Achaeans' strength,"
2719,BOOK III,"And now, forgotten all the splendour of spears,"
2720,BOOK III,"Lay mid the tents by moaning Hellespont,"
2721,BOOK III,"In stature more than human, even as lay"
2722,BOOK III,"Tityos, who sought to force Queen Leto, when"
2723,BOOK III,She fared to Pytho: swiftly in his wrath
2724,BOOK III,"Apollo shot, and laid him low, who seemed"
2725,BOOK III,Invincible: in a foul lake of gore
2726,BOOK III,"There lay he, covering many a rood of ground,"
2727,BOOK III,"On the broad earth, his mother; and she moaned"
2728,BOOK III,"Over her son, of blessed Gods abhorred;"
2729,BOOK III,But Lady Leto laughed.  So grand of mould
2730,BOOK III,"There in the foemen's land lay Aeacus' son,"
2731,BOOK III,"For joy to Trojans, but for endless grief"
2732,BOOK III,To Achaean men lamenting.  Moaned the air
2733,BOOK III,With sighing from the abysses of the sea;
2734,BOOK III,"And passing heavy grew the hearts of all,"
2735,BOOK III,"Thinking: ""Now shall we perish by the hands"
2736,BOOK III,"Of Trojans!""  Then by those dark ships they thought"
2737,BOOK III,"Of white-haired fathers left in halls afar,"
2738,BOOK III,"Of wives new-wedded, who by couches cold"
2739,BOOK III,"Mourned, waiting, waiting, with their tender babes"
2740,BOOK III,For husbands unreturning; and they groaned
2741,BOOK III,In bitterness of soul.  A passion of grief
2742,BOOK III,Came o'er their hearts; they fell upon their faces
2743,BOOK III,"On the deep sand flung down, and wept as men"
2744,BOOK III,"All comfortless round Peleus' mighty son,"
2745,BOOK III,"And clutched and plucked out by the roots their hair,"
2746,BOOK III,And east upon their heads defiling sand.
2747,BOOK III,Their cry was like the cry that goeth up
2748,BOOK III,From folk that after battle by their walls
2749,BOOK III,"Are slaughtered, when their maddened foes set fire"
2750,BOOK III,"To a great city, and slay in heaps on heaps"
2751,BOOK III,"Her people, and make spoil of all her wealth;"
2752,BOOK III,"So wild and high they wailed beside the sea,"
2753,BOOK III,"Because the Danaans' champion, Aeacus' son,"
2754,BOOK III,"Lay, grand in death, by a God's arrow slain,"
2755,BOOK III,"As Ares lay, when She of the Mighty Father"
2756,BOOK III,With that huge stone down dashed him on Troy's plain.
2757,BOOK III,
2758,BOOK III,"Ceaselessly wailed the Myrmidons Achilles,"
2759,BOOK III,"A ring of mourners round the kingly dead,"
2760,BOOK III,"That kind heart, friend alike to each and all,"
2761,BOOK III,"To no man arrogant nor hard of mood,"
2762,BOOK III,But ever tempering strength with courtesy.
2763,BOOK III,
2764,BOOK III,"Then Aias first, deep-groaning, uttered forth"
2765,BOOK III,His yearning o'er his father's brother's son
2766,BOOK III,"God-stricken--ay, no man had smitten him"
2767,BOOK III,Of all upon the wide-wayed earth that dwell!
2768,BOOK III,"Him glorious Aias heavy-hearted mourned,"
2769,BOOK III,"Now wandering to the tent of Peleus' son,"
2770,BOOK III,"Now cast down all his length, a giant form,"
2771,BOOK III,On the sea-sands; and thus lamented he:
2772,BOOK III,"""Achilles, shield and sword of Argive men,"
2773,BOOK III,"Thou hast died in Troy, from Phthia's plains afar,"
2774,BOOK III,"Smitten unwares by that accursed shaft,"
2775,BOOK III,Such thing as weakling dastards aim in fight!
2776,BOOK III,"For none who trusts in wielding the great shield,"
2777,BOOK III,None who for war can skill to set the helm
2778,BOOK III,"Upon his brows, and sway the spear in grip,"
2779,BOOK III,"And cleave the brass about the breasts of foes,"
2780,BOOK III,"Warreth with arrows, shrinking from the fray."
2781,BOOK III,"Not man to man he met thee, whoso smote;"
2782,BOOK III,Else woundless never had he 'scaped thy lance!
2783,BOOK III,"But haply Zeus purposed to ruin all,"
2784,BOOK III,And maketh all our toil and travail vain--
2785,BOOK III,"Ay, now will grant the Trojans victory"
2786,BOOK III,Who from Achaea now hath reft her shield!
2787,BOOK III,Ah me!  how shall old Peleus in his halls
2788,BOOK III,Take up the burden of a mighty grief
2789,BOOK III,Now in his joyless age!  His heart shall break
2790,BOOK III,"At the mere rumour of it.  Better so,"
2791,BOOK III,Thus in a moment to forget all pain.
2792,BOOK III,"But if these evil tidings slay him not,"
2793,BOOK III,"Ah, laden with sore sorrow eld shall come"
2794,BOOK III,"Upon him, eating out his heart with grief"
2795,BOOK III,By a lone hearth Peleus so passing dear
2796,BOOK III,Once to the Blessed!  But the Gods vouchsafe
2797,BOOK III,"No perfect happiness to hapless men."""
2798,BOOK III,
2799,BOOK III,So he in grief lamented Peleus' son.
2800,BOOK III,"Then ancient Phoenix made heart-stricken moan,"
2801,BOOK III,"Clasping the noble form of Aeacus' seed,"
2802,BOOK III,And in wild anguish wailed the wise of heart:
2803,BOOK III,"""Thou art reft from me, dear child, and cureless pain"
2804,BOOK III,Hast left to me!  Oh that upon my face
2805,BOOK III,"The veiling earth had fallen, ere I saw"
2806,BOOK III,Thy bitter doom!  No pang more terrible
2807,BOOK III,"Hath ever stabbed mine heart no, not that hour"
2808,BOOK III,"Of exile, when I fled from fatherland"
2809,BOOK III,"And noble parents, fleeing Hellas through,"
2810,BOOK III,"Till Peleus welcomed me with gifts, and lord"
2811,BOOK III,Of his Dolopians made me.  In his arms
2812,BOOK III,"Thee through his halls one day he bare, and set"
2813,BOOK III,"Upon my knees, and bade me foster thee,"
2814,BOOK III,"His babe, with all love, as mine own dear child:"
2815,BOOK III,I hearkened to him: blithely didst thou cling
2816,BOOK III,"About mine heart, and, babbling wordless speech,"
2817,BOOK III,"Didst call me `father' oft, and didst bedew"
2818,BOOK III,My breast and tunic with thy baby lips.
2819,BOOK III,Ofttimes with soul that laughed for glee I held
2820,BOOK III,Thee in mine arms; for mine heart whispered me
2821,BOOK III,"`This fosterling through life shall care for thee,"
2822,BOOK III,Staff of thine age shall be.'  And that mine hope
2823,BOOK III,Was for a little while fulfilled; but now
2824,BOOK III,"Thou hast vanished into darkness, and to me"
2825,BOOK III,Is left long heart-ache wild with all regret.
2826,BOOK III,"Ah, might my sorrow slay me, ere the tale"
2827,BOOK III,To noble Peleus come!  When on his ears
2828,BOOK III,"Falleth the heavy tidings, he shall weep"
2829,BOOK III,And wail without surcease.  Most piteous grief
2830,BOOK III,"We twain for thy sake shall inherit aye,"
2831,BOOK III,"Thy sire and I, who, ere our day of doom,"
2832,BOOK III,Mourning shall go down to the grave for thee--
2833,BOOK III,"Ay, better this than life unholpen of thee!"""
2834,BOOK III,
2835,BOOK III,So moaned his ever-swelling tide of grief.
2836,BOOK III,And Atreus' son beside him mourned and wept
2837,BOOK III,With heart on fire with inly smouldering pain:
2838,BOOK III,"""Thou hast perished, chiefest of the Danaan men,"
2839,BOOK III,"Hast perished, and hast left the Achaean host"
2840,BOOK III,"Fenceless!  Now thou art fallen, are they left"
2841,BOOK III,An easier prey to foes.  Thou hast given joy
2842,BOOK III,"To Trojans by thy fall, who dreaded thee"
2843,BOOK III,As sheep a lion.  These with eager hearts
2844,BOOK III,Even to the ships will bring the battle now.
2845,BOOK III,"Zeus, Father, thou too with deceitful words"
2846,BOOK III,Beguilest mortals!  Thou didst promise me
2847,BOOK III,That Priam's burg should be destroyed; but now
2848,BOOK III,"That promise given dost thou not fulfil,"
2849,BOOK III,But thou didst cheat mine heart: I shall not win
2850,BOOK III,"The war's goal, now Achilles is no more."""
2851,BOOK III,
2852,BOOK III,So did he cry heart-anguished.  Mourned all round
2853,BOOK III,Wails multitudinous for Peleus' son:
2854,BOOK III,"The dark ships echoed back the voice of grief,"
2855,BOOK III,And sighed and sobbed the immeasurable air.
2856,BOOK III,"And as when long sea-rollers, onward driven"
2857,BOOK III,"By a great wind, heave up far out at sea,"
2858,BOOK III,"And strandward sweep with terrible rush, and aye"
2859,BOOK III,"Headland and beach with shattered spray are scourged,"
2860,BOOK III,And roar unceasing; so a dread sound rose
2861,BOOK III,"Of moaning of the Danaans round the corse,"
2862,BOOK III,Ceaselessly wailing Peleus' aweless son.
2863,BOOK III,
2864,BOOK III,"And on their mourning soon black night had come,"
2865,BOOK III,"But spake unto Atreides Neleus' son,"
2866,BOOK III,"Nestor, whose own heart bare its load of grief"
2867,BOOK III,Remembering his own son Antilochus:
2868,BOOK III,"""O mighty Agamemnon, sceptre-lord"
2869,BOOK III,"Of Argives, from wide-shrilling lamentation"
2870,BOOK III,Refrain we for this day.  None shall withhold
2871,BOOK III,Hereafter these from all their heart's desire
2872,BOOK III,Of weeping and lamenting many days.
2873,BOOK III,"But now go to, from aweless Aeacus' son"
2874,BOOK III,"Wash we the foul blood-gouts, and lay we him"
2875,BOOK III,Upon a couch: unseemly it is to shame
2876,BOOK III,"The dead by leaving them untended long."""
2877,BOOK III,
2878,BOOK III,"So counselled Neleus' son, the passing-wise."
2879,BOOK III,"Then hasted he his men, and bade them set"
2880,BOOK III,"Caldrons of cold spring-water o'er the flames,"
2881,BOOK III,"And wash the corse, and clothe in vesture fair,"
2882,BOOK III,"Sea-purple, which his mother gave her son"
2883,BOOK III,At his first sailing against Troy.  With speed
2884,BOOK III,"They did their lord's command: with loving care,"
2885,BOOK III,"All service meetly rendered, on a couch"
2886,BOOK III,"Laid they the mighty fallen, Peleus' son."
2887,BOOK III,
2888,BOOK III,"The Trito-born, the passing-wise, beheld"
2889,BOOK III,"And pitied him, and showered upon his head"
2890,BOOK III,"Ambrosia, which hath virtue aye to keep"
2891,BOOK III,"Taintless, men say, the flesh of warriors slain."
2892,BOOK III,Like softly-breathing sleeper dewy-fresh
2893,BOOK III,She made him: over that dead face she drew
2894,BOOK III,"A stern frown, even as when he lay, with wrath"
2895,BOOK III,"Darkening his grim face, clasping his slain friend"
2896,BOOK III,Patroclus; and she made his frame to be
2897,BOOK III,"More massive, like a war-god to behold."
2898,BOOK III,"And wonder seized the Argives, as they thronged"
2899,BOOK III,"And saw the image of a living man,"
2900,BOOK III,Where all the stately length of Peleus' son
2901,BOOK III,"Lay on the couch, and seemed as though he slept."
2902,BOOK III,
2903,BOOK III,"Around him all the woeful captive-maids,"
2904,BOOK III,"Whom he had taken for a prey, what time"
2905,BOOK III,"He had ravaged hallowed Lemnos, and had scaled"
2906,BOOK III,"The towered crags of Thebes, Eetion's town,"
2907,BOOK III,"Wailed, as they stood and rent their fair young flesh,"
2908,BOOK III,"And smote their breasts, and from their hearts bemoaned"
2909,BOOK III,"That lord of gentleness and courtesy,"
2910,BOOK III,Who honoured even the daughters of his foes.
2911,BOOK III,And stricken most of all with heart-sick pain
2912,BOOK III,"Briseis, hero Achilles' couchmate, bowed"
2913,BOOK III,"Over the dead, and tore her fair young flesh"
2914,BOOK III,"With ruthless fingers, shrieking: her soft breast"
2915,BOOK III,"Was ridged with gory weals, so cruelly"
2916,BOOK III,She smote it thou hadst said that crimson blood
2917,BOOK III,"Had dripped on milk.  Yet, in her griefs despite,"
2918,BOOK III,"Her winsome loveliness shone out, and grace"
2919,BOOK III,"Hung like a veil about her, as she wailed:"
2920,BOOK III,"""Woe for this grief passing all griefs beside!"
2921,BOOK III,Never on me came anguish like to this
2922,BOOK III,"Not when my brethren died, my fatherland"
2923,BOOK III,Was wasted--like this anguish for thy death!
2924,BOOK III,"Thou wast my day, my sunlight, my sweet life,"
2925,BOOK III,"Mine hope of good, my strong defence from harm,"
2926,BOOK III,"Dearer than all my beauty--yea, more dear"
2927,BOOK III,Than my lost parents!  Thou wast all in all
2928,BOOK III,"To me, thou only, captive though I be."
2929,BOOK III,Thou tookest from me every bondmaid's task
2930,BOOK III,"And like a wife didst hold me.  Ah, but now"
2931,BOOK III,Me shall some new Achaean master bear
2932,BOOK III,"To fertile Sparta, or to thirsty Argos."
2933,BOOK III,"The bitter cup of thraldom shall I drain,"
2934,BOOK III,"Severed, ah me, from thee!  Oh that the earth"
2935,BOOK III,"Had veiled my dead face ere I saw thy doom!"""
2936,BOOK III,
2937,BOOK III,So for slain Peleus' son did she lament
2938,BOOK III,"With woeful handmaids and heart-anguished Greeks,"
2939,BOOK III,"Mourning a king, a husband.  Never dried"
2940,BOOK III,Her tears were: ever to the earth they streamed
2941,BOOK III,Like sunless water trickling from a rock
2942,BOOK III,While rime and snow yet mantle o'er the earth
2943,BOOK III,Above it; yet the frost melts down before
2944,BOOK III,The east-wind and the flame-shafts of the sun.
2945,BOOK III,
2946,BOOK III,Now came the sound of that upringing wail
2947,BOOK III,"To Nereus' Daughters, dwellers in the depths"
2948,BOOK III,Unfathomed.  With sore anguish all their hearts
2949,BOOK III,Were smitten: piteously they moaned: their cry
2950,BOOK III,Shivered along the waves of Hellespont.
2951,BOOK III,Then with dark mantles overpalled they sped
2952,BOOK III,Swiftly to where the Argive men were thronged.
2953,BOOK III,"As rushed their troop up silver paths of sea,"
2954,BOOK III,The flood disported round them as they came.
2955,BOOK III,"With one wild cry they floated up; it rang,"
2956,BOOK III,A sound as when fleet-flying cranes forebode
2957,BOOK III,A great storm.  Moaned the monsters of the deep
2958,BOOK III,Plaintively round that train of mourners.  Fast
2959,BOOK III,"On sped they to their goal, with awesome cry"
2960,BOOK III,Wailing the while their sister's mighty son.
2961,BOOK III,Swiftly from Helicon the Muses came
2962,BOOK III,"Heart-burdened with undying grief, for love"
2963,BOOK III,And honour to the Nereid starry-eyed.
2964,BOOK III,
2965,BOOK III,"Then Zeus with courage filled the Argive men,"
2966,BOOK III,That-eyes of flesh might undismayed behold
2967,BOOK III,That glorious gathering of Goddesses.
2968,BOOK III,Then those Divine Ones round Achilles' corse
2969,BOOK III,Pealed forth with one voice from immortal lips
2970,BOOK III,A lamentation.  Rang again the shores
2971,BOOK III,Of Hellespont.  As rain upon the earth
2972,BOOK III,"Their tears fell round the dead man, Aeacus' son;"
2973,BOOK III,For out of depths of sorrow rose their moan.
2974,BOOK III,"And all the armour, yea, the tents, the ships"
2975,BOOK III,Of that great sorrowing multitude were wet
2976,BOOK III,With tears from ever-welling springs of grief.
2977,BOOK III,"His mother cast her on him, clasping him,"
2978,BOOK III,"And kissed her son's lips, crying through her tears:"
2979,BOOK III,"""Now let the rosy-vestured Dawn in heaven"
2980,BOOK III,Exult!  Now let broad-flowing Axius
2981,BOOK III,"Exult, and for Asteropaeus dead"
2982,BOOK III,Put by his wrath!  Let Priam's seed be glad
2983,BOOK III,"But I unto Olympus will ascend,"
2984,BOOK III,And at the feet of everlasting Zeus
2985,BOOK III,"Will cast me, bitterly planning that he gave"
2986,BOOK III,"Me, an unwilling bride, unto a man--"
2987,BOOK III,"A man whom joyless eld soon overtook,"
2988,BOOK III,"To whom the Fates are near, with death for gift."
2989,BOOK III,Yet not so much for his lot do I grieve
2990,BOOK III,As for Achilles; for Zeus promised me
2991,BOOK III,"To make him glorious in the Aeacid halls,"
2992,BOOK III,In recompense for the bridal I so loathed
2993,BOOK III,"That into wild wind now I changed me, now"
2994,BOOK III,"To water, now in fashion as a bird"
2995,BOOK III,"I was, now as the blast of flame; nor might"
2996,BOOK III,"A mortal win me for his bride, who seemed"
2997,BOOK III,"All shapes in turn that earth and heaven contain,"
2998,BOOK III,Until the Olympian pledged him to bestow
2999,BOOK III,"A godlike son on me, a lord of war."
3000,BOOK III,"Yea, in a manner this did he fulfil"
3001,BOOK III,Faithfully; for my son was mightiest
3002,BOOK III,Of men.  But Zeus made brief his span of life
3003,BOOK III,Unto my sorrow.  Therefore up to heaven
3004,BOOK III,Will I: to Zeus's mansion will I go
3005,BOOK III,"And wail my son, and will put Zeus in mind"
3006,BOOK III,Of all my travail for him and his sons
3007,BOOK III,"In their sore stress, and sting his soul with shame."""
3008,BOOK III,
3009,BOOK III,So in her wild lament the Sea-queen cried.
3010,BOOK III,"But now to Thetis spake Calliope,"
3011,BOOK III,She in whose heart was steadfast wisdom throned:
3012,BOOK III,"""From lamentation, Thetis, now forbear,"
3013,BOOK III,"And do not, in the frenzy of thy grief"
3014,BOOK III,"For thy lost son, provoke to wrath the Lord"
3015,BOOK III,"Of Gods and men.  Lo, even sons of Zeus,"
3016,BOOK III,"The Thunder-king, have perished, overborne"
3017,BOOK III,"By evil fate.  Immortal though I be,"
3018,BOOK III,"Mine own son Orpheus died, whose magic song"
3019,BOOK III,"Drew all the forest-trees to follow him,"
3020,BOOK III,"And every craggy rock and river-stream,"
3021,BOOK III,"And blasts of winds shrill-piping stormy-breathed,"
3022,BOOK III,And birds that dart through air on rushing wings.
3023,BOOK III,Yet I endured mine heavy sorrow: Gods
3024,BOOK III,Ought not with anguished grief to vex their souls.
3025,BOOK III,Therefore make end of sorrow-stricken wail
3026,BOOK III,For thy brave child; for to the sons of earth
3027,BOOK III,"Minstrels shall chant his glory and his might,"
3028,BOOK III,"By mine and by my sisters' inspiration,"
3029,BOOK III,Unto the end of time.  Let not thy soul
3030,BOOK III,"Be crushed by dark grief, nor do thou lament"
3031,BOOK III,Like those frail mortal women.  Know'st thou not
3032,BOOK III,That round all men which dwell upon the earth
3033,BOOK III,"Hovereth irresistible deadly Fate,"
3034,BOOK III,Who recks not even of the Gods?  Such power
3035,BOOK III,"She only hath for heritage.  Yea, she"
3036,BOOK III,"Soon shall destroy gold-wealthy Priam's town,"
3037,BOOK III,"And Trojans many and Argives doom to death,"
3038,BOOK III,"Whomso she will.  No God can stay her hand."""
3039,BOOK III,
3040,BOOK III,So in her wisdom spake Calliope.
3041,BOOK III,"Then plunged the sun down into Ocean's stream,"
3042,BOOK III,And sable-vestured Night came floating up
3043,BOOK III,"O'er the wide firmament, and brought her boon"
3044,BOOK III,Of sleep to sorrowing mortals.  On the sands
3045,BOOK III,"There slept they, all the Achaean host, with heads"
3046,BOOK III,Bowed 'neath the burden of calamity.
3047,BOOK III,But upon Thetis sleep laid not his hand:
3048,BOOK III,Still with the deathless Nereids by the sea
3049,BOOK III,She sate; on either side the Muses spake
3050,BOOK III,One after other comfortable words
3051,BOOK III,To make that sorrowing heart forget its pain.
3052,BOOK III,
3053,BOOK III,But when with a triumphant laugh the Dawn
3054,BOOK III,"Soared up the sky, and her most radiant light"
3055,BOOK III,"Shed over all the Trojans and their king,"
3056,BOOK III,"Then, sorrowing sorely for Achilles still,"
3057,BOOK III,"The Danaans woke to weep.  Day after day,"
3058,BOOK III,For many days they wept.  Around them moaned
3059,BOOK III,"Far-stretching beaches of the sea, and mourned"
3060,BOOK III,Great Nereus for his daughter Thetis' sake;
3061,BOOK III,And mourned with him the other Sea-gods all
3062,BOOK III,For dead Achilles.  Then the Argives gave
3063,BOOK III,The corpse of great Peleides to the flame.
3064,BOOK III,A pyre of countless tree-trunks built they up
3065,BOOK III,"Which, all with one mind toiling, from the heights"
3066,BOOK III,Of Ida they brought down; for Atreus' sons
3067,BOOK III,"Sped on the work, and charged them to bring thence"
3068,BOOK III,"Wood without measure, that consumed with speed"
3069,BOOK III,Might be Achilles' body.  All around
3070,BOOK III,Piled they about the pyre much battle-gear
3071,BOOK III,Of strong men slain; and slew and cast thereon
3072,BOOK III,"Full many goodly sons of Trojan men,"
3073,BOOK III,"And snorting steeds, and mighty bulls withal,"
3074,BOOK III,And sheep and fatling swine thereon they cast.
3075,BOOK III,And wailing captive maids from coffers brought
3076,BOOK III,Mantles untold; all cast they on the pyre:
3077,BOOK III,Gold heaped they there and amber.  All their hair
3078,BOOK III,"The Myrmidons shore, and shrouded with the same"
3079,BOOK III,The body of their king.  Briseis laid
3080,BOOK III,"Her own shorn tresses on the corpse, her gift,"
3081,BOOK III,"Her last, unto her lord.  Great jars of oil"
3082,BOOK III,"Full many poured they out thereon, with jars"
3083,BOOK III,"Of honey and of wine, rich blood of the grape"
3084,BOOK III,"That breathed an odour as of nectar, yea,"
3085,BOOK III,Cast incense-breathing perfumes manifold
3086,BOOK III,"Marvellous sweet, the precious things put forth"
3087,BOOK III,"By earth, and treasures of the sea divine."
3088,BOOK III,
3089,BOOK III,"Then, when all things were set in readiness"
3090,BOOK III,"About the pyre, all, footmen, charioteers,"
3091,BOOK III,"Compassed that woeful bale, clashing their arms,"
3092,BOOK III,"While, from the viewless heights Olympian, Zeus"
3093,BOOK III,Rained down ambrosia on dead Aeacus' son.
3094,BOOK III,"For honour to the Goddess, Nereus' child,"
3095,BOOK III,"He sent to Aeolus Hermes, bidding him"
3096,BOOK III,"Summon the sacred might of his swift winds,"
3097,BOOK III,For that the corpse of Aeacus' son must now
3098,BOOK III,"Be burned.  With speed he went, and Aeolus"
3099,BOOK III,Refused not: the tempestuous North in haste
3100,BOOK III,"He summoned, and the wild blast of the West;"
3101,BOOK III,And to Troy sped they on their whirlwind wings.
3102,BOOK III,"Fast in mad onrush, fast across the deep"
3103,BOOK III,They darted; roared beneath them as they flew
3104,BOOK III,"The sea, the land; above crashed thunder-voiced"
3105,BOOK III,Clouds headlong hurtling through the firmament.
3106,BOOK III,Then by decree of Zeus down on the pyre
3107,BOOK III,"Of slain Achilles, like a charging host"
3108,BOOK III,Swooped they; upleapt the Fire-god's madding breath:
3109,BOOK III,Uprose a long wail from the Myrmidons.
3110,BOOK III,"Then, though with whirlwind rushes toiled the winds,"
3111,BOOK III,"All day, all night, they needs must fan the flames"
3112,BOOK III,Ere that death-pyre burned out.  Up to the heavens
3113,BOOK III,Vast-volumed rolled the smoke.  The huge tree-trunks
3114,BOOK III,"Groaned, writhing, bursting, in the heat, and dropped"
3115,BOOK III,The dark-grey ash all round.  So when the winds
3116,BOOK III,"Had tirelessly fulfilled their mighty task,"
3117,BOOK III,Back to their cave they rode cloud-charioted.
3118,BOOK III,
3119,BOOK III,"Then, when the fire had last of all consumed"
3120,BOOK III,"That hero-king, when all the steeds, the men"
3121,BOOK III,"Slain round the pyre had first been ravined up,"
3122,BOOK III,With all the costly offerings laid around
3123,BOOK III,"The mighty dead by Achaia's weeping sons,"
3124,BOOK III,The glowing embers did the Myrmidons quench
3125,BOOK III,With wine.  Then clear to be discerned were seen
3126,BOOK III,"His bones; for nowise like the rest were they,"
3127,BOOK III,But like an ancient Giant's; none beside
3128,BOOK III,"With these were blent; for bulls and steeds, and sons"
3129,BOOK III,"Of Troy, with all that mingled hecatomb,"
3130,BOOK III,"Lay in a wide ring round his corse, and he"
3131,BOOK III,"Amidst them, flame-devoured, lay there alone."
3132,BOOK III,So his companions groaning gathered up
3133,BOOK III,"His bones, and in a silver casket laid"
3134,BOOK III,"Massy and deep, and banded and bestarred"
3135,BOOK III,With flashing gold; and Nereus' daughters shed
3136,BOOK III,"Ambrosia over them, and precious nards"
3137,BOOK III,For honour to Achilles: fat of kine
3138,BOOK III,And amber honey poured they over all.
3139,BOOK III,"A golden vase his mother gave, the gift"
3140,BOOK III,"In old time of the Wine-god, glorious work"
3141,BOOK III,"Of the craft-master Fire-god, in the which"
3142,BOOK III,They laid the casket that enclosed the bones
3143,BOOK III,Of mighty-souled Achilles.  All around
3144,BOOK III,"The Argives heaped a barrow, a giant sign,"
3145,BOOK III,"Upon a foreland's uttermost end, beside"
3146,BOOK III,"The Hellespont's deep waters, wailing loud"
3147,BOOK III,Farewells unto the Myrmidons' hero-king.
3148,BOOK III,
3149,BOOK III,Nor stayed the immortal steeds of Aeacus' son
3150,BOOK III,Tearless beside the ships; they also mourned
3151,BOOK III,Their slain king: sorely loth were they to abide
3152,BOOK III,Longer mid mortal men or Argive steeds
3153,BOOK III,Bearing a burden of consuming grief;
3154,BOOK III,"But fain were they to soar through air, afar"
3155,BOOK III,"From wretched men, over the Ocean's streams,"
3156,BOOK III,"Over the Sea-queen's caverns, unto where"
3157,BOOK III,Divine Podarge bare that storm-foot twain
3158,BOOK III,Begotten of the West-wind clarion-voiced
3159,BOOK III,"Yea, and they had accomplished their desire,"
3160,BOOK III,"But the Gods' purpose held them back, until"
3161,BOOK III,From Scyros' isle Achilles' fleetfoot son
3162,BOOK III,"Should come.  Him waited they to welcome, when"
3163,BOOK III,"He came unto the war-host; for the Fates,"
3164,BOOK III,"Daughters of holy Chaos, at their birth"
3165,BOOK III,"Had spun the life-threads of those deathless foals,"
3166,BOOK III,"Even to serve Poseidon first, and next"
3167,BOOK III,"Peleus the dauntless king, Achilles then"
3168,BOOK III,"The invincible, and, after these, the fourth,"
3169,BOOK III,"The mighty-hearted Neoptolemus,"
3170,BOOK III,Whom after death to the Elysian Plain
3171,BOOK III,"They were to bear, unto the Blessed Land,"
3172,BOOK III,"By Zeus' decree.  For which cause, though their hearts"
3173,BOOK III,"Were pierced with bitter anguish, they abode"
3174,BOOK III,"Still by the ships, with spirits sorrowing"
3175,BOOK III,"For their old lord, and yearning for the new."
3176,BOOK III,
3177,BOOK III,Then from the surge of heavy-plunging seas
3178,BOOK III,Rose the Earth-shaker.  No man saw his feet
3179,BOOK III,"Pace up the strand, but suddenly he stood"
3180,BOOK III,"Beside the Nereid Goddesses, and spake"
3181,BOOK III,"To Thetis, yet for Achilles bowed with grief:"
3182,BOOK III,"""Refrain from endless mourning for thy son."
3183,BOOK III,"Not with the dead shall he abide, but dwell"
3184,BOOK III,"With Gods, as doth the might of Herakles,"
3185,BOOK III,And Dionysus ever fair.  Not him
3186,BOOK III,"Dread doom shall prison in darkness evermore,"
3187,BOOK III,Nor Hades keep him.  To the light of Zeus
3188,BOOK III,Soon shall he rise; and I will give to him
3189,BOOK III,A holy island for my gift: it lies
3190,BOOK III,Within the Euxine Sea: there evermore
3191,BOOK III,A God thy son shall be.  The tribes that dwell
3192,BOOK III,Around shall as mine own self honour him
3193,BOOK III,With incense and with steam of sacrifice.
3194,BOOK III,"Hush thy laments, vex not thine heart with grief."""
3195,BOOK III,
3196,BOOK III,Then like a wind-breath had he passed away
3197,BOOK III,"Over the sea, when that consoling word"
3198,BOOK III,Was spoken; and a little in her breast
3199,BOOK III,Revived the spirit of Thetis: and the God
3200,BOOK III,Brought this to pass thereafter.  All the host
3201,BOOK III,"Moved moaning thence, and came unto the ships"
3202,BOOK III,That brought them o'er from Hellas.  Then returned
3203,BOOK III,"To Helicon the Muses: 'neath the sea,"
3204,BOOK III,"Wailing the dear dead, Nereus' Daughters sank,"
3205,BOOK III,
3206,BOOK III,
3207,BOOK III,
3208,BOOK IV,BOOK IV
3209,BOOK IV,
3210,BOOK IV,How in the Funeral Games of Achilles heroes contended.
3211,BOOK IV,
3212,BOOK IV,
3213,BOOK IV,Nor did the hapless Trojans leave unwept
3214,BOOK IV,"The warrior-king Hippolochus' hero-son,"
3215,BOOK IV,"But laid, in front of the Dardanian gate,"
3216,BOOK IV,Upon the pyre that captain war-renowned.
3217,BOOK IV,But him Apollo's self caught swiftly up
3218,BOOK IV,"Out of the blazing fire, and to the winds"
3219,BOOK IV,"Gave him, to bear away to Lycia-land;"
3220,BOOK IV,"And fast and far they bare him, 'neath the glens"
3221,BOOK IV,"Of high Telandrus, to a lovely glade;"
3222,BOOK IV,And for a monument above his grave
3223,BOOK IV,Upheaved a granite rock. The Nymphs therefrom
3224,BOOK IV,Made gush the hallowed water of a stream
3225,BOOK IV,"For ever flowing, which the tribes of men"
3226,BOOK IV,Still call fair-fleeting Glaucus. This the gods
3227,BOOK IV,Wrought for an honour to the Lycian king.
3228,BOOK IV,
3229,BOOK IV,But for Achilles still the Argives mourned
3230,BOOK IV,Beside the swift ships: heart-sick were they all
3231,BOOK IV,With dolorous pain and grief.  Each yearned for him
3232,BOOK IV,As for a son; no eye in that wide host
3233,BOOK IV,Was tearless.  But the Trojans with great joy
3234,BOOK IV,"Exulted, seeing their sorrow from afar,"
3235,BOOK IV,And the great fire that spake their foe consumed.
3236,BOOK IV,And thus a vaunting voice amidst them cried:
3237,BOOK IV,"""Now hath Cronion from his heaven vouchsafed"
3238,BOOK IV,"A joy past hope unto our longing eyes,"
3239,BOOK IV,To see Achilles fallen before Troy.
3240,BOOK IV,"Now he is smitten down, the glorious hosts"
3241,BOOK IV,"Of Troy, I trow, shall win a breathing-space"
3242,BOOK IV,From blood of death and from the murderous fray.
3243,BOOK IV,Ever his heart devised the Trojans' bane;
3244,BOOK IV,In his hands maddened aye the spear of doom
3245,BOOK IV,"With gore besprent, and none of us that faced"
3246,BOOK IV,Him in the fight beheld another dawn.
3247,BOOK IV,"But now, I wot, Achaea's valorous sons"
3248,BOOK IV,"Shall flee unto their galleys shapely-prowed,"
3249,BOOK IV,Since slain Achilles lies.  Ah that the might
3250,BOOK IV,"Of Hector still were here, that he might slay"
3251,BOOK IV,"The Argives one and all amidst their tents!"""
3252,BOOK IV,
3253,BOOK IV,So in unbridled joy a Trojan cried;
3254,BOOK IV,But one more wise and prudent answered him:
3255,BOOK IV,"""Thou deemest that yon murderous Danaan host"
3256,BOOK IV,"Will straightway get them to the ships, to flee"
3257,BOOK IV,"Over the misty sea.  Nay, still their lust"
3258,BOOK IV,"Is hot for fight: us will they nowise fear,"
3259,BOOK IV,"Still are there left strong battle-eager men,"
3260,BOOK IV,"As Aias, as Tydeides, Atreus' sons:"
3261,BOOK IV,"Though dead Achilles be, I still fear these."
3262,BOOK IV,Oh that Apollo Silverbow would end them!
3263,BOOK IV,Then in that day were given to our prayers
3264,BOOK IV,"A breathing-space from war and ghastly death."""
3265,BOOK IV,
3266,BOOK IV,"In heaven was dole among the Immortal Ones,"
3267,BOOK IV,Even all that helped the stalwart Danaans' cause.
3268,BOOK IV,In clouds like mountains piled they veiled their heads
3269,BOOK IV,For grief of soul.  But glad those others were
3270,BOOK IV,Who fain would speed Troy to a happy goal.
3271,BOOK IV,Then unto Cronos' Son great Hera spake:
3272,BOOK IV,"""Zeus, Lightning-father, wherefore helpest thou"
3273,BOOK IV,"Troy, all forgetful of the fair-haired bride"
3274,BOOK IV,Whom once to Peleus thou didst give to wife
3275,BOOK IV,Midst Pelion's glens?  Thyself didst bring to pass
3276,BOOK IV,Those spousals of a Goddess: on that day
3277,BOOK IV,"All we Immortals feasted there, and gave"
3278,BOOK IV,"Gifts passing-fair.  All this dost thou forget,"
3279,BOOK IV,"And hast devised for Hellas heaviest woe."""
3280,BOOK IV,
3281,BOOK IV,So spake she; but Zeus answered not a word;
3282,BOOK IV,"For pondering there he sat with burdened breast,"
3283,BOOK IV,Thinking how soon the Argives should destroy
3284,BOOK IV,"The city of Priam, thinking how himself"
3285,BOOK IV,Would visit on the victors ruin dread
3286,BOOK IV,In war and on the great sea thunder-voiced.
3287,BOOK IV,"Such thoughts were his, ere long to be fulfilled."
3288,BOOK IV,
3289,BOOK IV,Now sank the sun to Ocean's fathomless flood:
3290,BOOK IV,"O'er the dim land the infinite darkness stole,"
3291,BOOK IV,Wherein men gain a little rest from toil.
3292,BOOK IV,"Then by the ships, despite their sorrow, supped"
3293,BOOK IV,"The Argives, for ye cannot thrust aside"
3294,BOOK IV,"Hunger's importunate craving, when it comes"
3295,BOOK IV,"Upon the breast, but straightway heavy and faint"
3296,BOOK IV,Lithe limbs become; nor is there remedy
3297,BOOK IV,Until one satisfy this clamorous guest
3298,BOOK IV,Therefore these ate the meat of eventide
3299,BOOK IV,In grief for Achilles' hard necessity
3300,BOOK IV,"Constrained them all.  And, when they had broken bread,"
3301,BOOK IV,"Sweet sleep came on them, loosening from their frames"
3302,BOOK IV,"Care's heavy chain, and quickening strength anew"
3303,BOOK IV,
3304,BOOK IV,But when the starry Bears had eastward turned
3305,BOOK IV,"Their heads, expectant of the uprushing light"
3306,BOOK IV,"Of Helios, and when woke the Queen of Dawn,"
3307,BOOK IV,Then rose from sleep the stalwart Argive men
3308,BOOK IV,Purposing for the Trojans death and doom.
3309,BOOK IV,Stirred were they like the roughly-ridging sea
3310,BOOK IV,"Icarian, or as sudden-rippling corn"
3311,BOOK IV,"In harvest field, what time the rushing wings"
3312,BOOK IV,Of the cloud-gathering West sweep over it;
3313,BOOK IV,So upon Hellespont's strand the folk were stirred.
3314,BOOK IV,And to those eager hearts cried Tydeus' son:
3315,BOOK IV,"""If we be battle-biders, friends, indeed,"
3316,BOOK IV,"More fiercely fight we now the hated foe,"
3317,BOOK IV,Lest they take heart because Achilles lives
3318,BOOK IV,"No longer.  Come, with armour, car, and steed"
3319,BOOK IV,"Let us beset them.  Glory waits our toil?"""
3320,BOOK IV,
3321,BOOK IV,But battle-eager Aias answering spake
3322,BOOK IV,"""Brave be thy words, and nowise idle talk,"
3323,BOOK IV,"Kindling the dauntless Argive men, whose hearts"
3324,BOOK IV,"Before were battle-eager, to the fight"
3325,BOOK IV,"Against the Trojan men, O Tydeus' son."
3326,BOOK IV,But we must needs abide amidst the ships
3327,BOOK IV,Till Goddess Thetis come forth of the sea;
3328,BOOK IV,For that her heart is purposed to set here
3329,BOOK IV,Fair athlete-prizes for the funeral-games.
3330,BOOK IV,"This yesterday she told me, ere she plunged"
3331,BOOK IV,"Into sea-depths, yea, spake to me apart"
3332,BOOK IV,"From other Danaans; and, I trow, by this"
3333,BOOK IV,"Her haste hath brought her nigh.  Yon Trojan men,"
3334,BOOK IV,"Though Peleus' son hath died, shall have small heart"
3335,BOOK IV,"For battle, while myself am yet alive,"
3336,BOOK IV,"And thou, and noble Atreus' son, the king."""
3337,BOOK IV,
3338,BOOK IV,"So spake the mighty son of Telamon,"
3339,BOOK IV,But knew not that a dark and bitter doom
3340,BOOK IV,For him should follow hard upon those games
3341,BOOK IV,By Fate's contrivance.  Answered Tydeus' son
3342,BOOK IV,"""O friend, if Thetis comes indeed this day"
3343,BOOK IV,"With goodly gifts for her son's funeral-games,"
3344,BOOK IV,"Then bide we by the ships, and keep we here"
3345,BOOK IV,All others.  Meet it is to do the will
3346,BOOK IV,"Of the Immortals: yea, to Achilles too,"
3347,BOOK IV,"Though the Immortals willed it not, ourselves"
3348,BOOK IV,"Must render honour grateful to the dead."""
3349,BOOK IV,
3350,BOOK IV,So spake the battle-eager Tydeus' son.
3351,BOOK IV,"And lo, the Bride of Peleus gliding came"
3352,BOOK IV,"Forth of the sea, like the still breath of dawn,"
3353,BOOK IV,And suddenly was with the Argive throng
3354,BOOK IV,"Where eager-faced they waited, some, that looked"
3355,BOOK IV,"Soon to contend in that great athlete-strife,"
3356,BOOK IV,"And some, to joy in seeing the mighty strive."
3357,BOOK IV,Amidst that gathering Thetis sable-stoled
3358,BOOK IV,"Set down her prizes, and she summoned forth"
3359,BOOK IV,Achaea's champions: at her best they came.
3360,BOOK IV,
3361,BOOK IV,"But first amidst them all rose Neleus' son,"
3362,BOOK IV,Not as desiring in the strife of fists
3363,BOOK IV,"To toil, nor strain of wrestling; for his arms"
3364,BOOK IV,And all his sinews were with grievous eld
3365,BOOK IV,"Outworn, but still his heart and brain were strong."
3366,BOOK IV,Of all the Achaeans none could match himself
3367,BOOK IV,Against him in the folkmote's war of words;
3368,BOOK IV,"Yea, even Laertes' glorious son to him"
3369,BOOK IV,Ever gave place when men for speech were met;
3370,BOOK IV,"Nor he alone, but even the kingliest"
3371,BOOK IV,"Of Argives, Agamemnon, lord of spears."
3372,BOOK IV,Now in their midst he sang the gracious Queen
3373,BOOK IV,"Of Nereids, sang how she in willsomeness"
3374,BOOK IV,Of beauty was of all the Sea-maids chief.
3375,BOOK IV,"Well-pleased she hearkened.  Yet again he sang,"
3376,BOOK IV,"Singing of Peleus' Bridal of Delight,"
3377,BOOK IV,Which all the blest Immortals brought to pass
3378,BOOK IV,By Pelion's crests; sang of the ambrosial feast
3379,BOOK IV,When the swift Hours brought in immortal hands
3380,BOOK IV,"Meats not of earth, and heaped in golden maunds;"
3381,BOOK IV,Sang how the silver tables were set forth
3382,BOOK IV,In haste by Themis blithely laughing; sang
3383,BOOK IV,How breathed Hephaestus purest flame of fire;
3384,BOOK IV,Sang how the Nymphs in golden chalices
3385,BOOK IV,Mingled ambrosia; sang the ravishing dance
3386,BOOK IV,Twined by the Graces' feet; sang of the chant
3387,BOOK IV,"The Muses raised, and how its spell enthralled"
3388,BOOK IV,"All mountains, rivers, all the forest brood;"
3389,BOOK IV,"How raptured was the infinite firmament,"
3390,BOOK IV,"Cheiron's fair caverns, yea, the very Gods."
3391,BOOK IV,
3392,BOOK IV,Such noble strain did Neleus' son pour out
3393,BOOK IV,Into the Argives' eager ears; and they
3394,BOOK IV,Hearkened with ravished souls.  Then in their midst
3395,BOOK IV,He sang once more the imperishable deeds
3396,BOOK IV,Of princely Achilles.  All the mighty throng
3397,BOOK IV,Acclaimed him with delight.  From that beginning
3398,BOOK IV,With fitly chosen words did he extol
3399,BOOK IV,The glorious hero; how he voyaged and smote
3400,BOOK IV,Twelve cities; how he marched o'er leagues on leagues
3401,BOOK IV,"Of land, and spoiled eleven; how he slew"
3402,BOOK IV,Telephus and Eetion's might renowned
3403,BOOK IV,"In Thebe; how his spear laid Cyenus low,"
3404,BOOK IV,"Poseidon's son, and godlike Polydorus,"
3405,BOOK IV,"Troilus the goodly, princely Asteropaeus;"
3406,BOOK IV,And how he dyed with blood the river-streams
3407,BOOK IV,"Of Xanthus, and with countless corpses choked"
3408,BOOK IV,"His murmuring flow, when from the limbs he tore"
3409,BOOK IV,Lycaon's life beside the sounding river;
3410,BOOK IV,And how he smote down Hector; how he slew
3411,BOOK IV,"Penthesileia, and the godlike son"
3412,BOOK IV,Of splendour-throned Dawn;--all this he sang
3413,BOOK IV,To Argives which already knew the tale;
3414,BOOK IV,"Sang of his giant mould, how no man's strength"
3415,BOOK IV,"In fight could stand against him, nor in games"
3416,BOOK IV,"Where strong men strive for mastery, where the swift"
3417,BOOK IV,Contend with flying feet or hurrying wheels
3418,BOOK IV,"Of chariots, nor in combat panoplied;"
3419,BOOK IV,And how in goodlihead he far outshone
3420,BOOK IV,"All Danaans, and how his bodily might"
3421,BOOK IV,Was measureless in the stormy clash of war.
3422,BOOK IV,"Last, he prayed Heaven that he might see a son"
3423,BOOK IV,Like that great sire from sea-washed Scyros come.
3424,BOOK IV,
3425,BOOK IV,That noble song acclaiming Argives praised;
3426,BOOK IV,"Yea, silver-looted Thetis smiled, and gave"
3427,BOOK IV,"The singer fleetfoot horses, given of old"
3428,BOOK IV,Beside Caicus' mouth by Telephus
3429,BOOK IV,"To Achilles, when he healed the torturing wound"
3430,BOOK IV,With that same spear wherewith himself had pierced
3431,BOOK IV,"Telephus' thigh, and thrust the point clear through."
3432,BOOK IV,"These Nestor Neleus' son to his comrades gave,"
3433,BOOK IV,"And, glorying in their godlike lord, they led"
3434,BOOK IV,The steeds unto his ships.  Then Thetis set
3435,BOOK IV,"Amidst the athlete-ring ten kine, to be"
3436,BOOK IV,"Her prizes for the footrace, and by each"
3437,BOOK IV,Ran a fair suckling calf.  These the bold might
3438,BOOK IV,Of Peleus' tireless son had driven down
3439,BOOK IV,"From slopes of Ida, prizes of his spear."
3440,BOOK IV,
3441,BOOK IV,"To strive for these rose up two victory-fain,"
3442,BOOK IV,"Teucer the first, the son of Telamon,"
3443,BOOK IV,"And Aias, of the Locrian archers chief."
3444,BOOK IV,These twain with swift hands girded them about
3445,BOOK IV,"With loin-cloths, reverencing the Goddess-bride"
3446,BOOK IV,"Of Peleus, and the Sea-maids, who with her"
3447,BOOK IV,Came to behold the Argives' athlete-sport.
3448,BOOK IV,"And Atreus' son, lord of all Argive men,"
3449,BOOK IV,Showed them the turning-goal of that swift course.
3450,BOOK IV,"Then these the Queen of Rivalry spurred on,"
3451,BOOK IV,As from the starting-line like falcons swift
3452,BOOK IV,They sped away.  Long doubtful was the race:
3453,BOOK IV,"Now, as the Argives gazed, would Aias' friends"
3454,BOOK IV,"Shout, now rang out the answering cheer from friends"
3455,BOOK IV,Of Teucer.  But when in their eager speed
3456,BOOK IV,"Close on the end they were, then Teucer's feet"
3457,BOOK IV,Were trammelled by unearthly powers: some god
3458,BOOK IV,Or demon dashed his foot against the stock
3459,BOOK IV,Of a deep-rooted tamarisk.  Sorely wrenched
3460,BOOK IV,Was his left ankle: round the joint upswelled
3461,BOOK IV,The veins high-ridged.  A great shout rang from all
3462,BOOK IV,That watched the contest.  Aias darted past
3463,BOOK IV,Exultant: ran his Locrian folk to hail
3464,BOOK IV,"Their lord, with sudden joy in all their souls."
3465,BOOK IV,"Then to his ships they drave the kine, and cast"
3466,BOOK IV,Fodder before them.  Eager-helpful friends
3467,BOOK IV,Led Teucer halting thence.  The leeches drew
3468,BOOK IV,Blood from his foot: then over it they laid
3469,BOOK IV,"Soft-shredded linen ointment-smeared, and swathed"
3470,BOOK IV,"With smooth bands round, and charmed away the pain."
3471,BOOK IV,
3472,BOOK IV,Then swiftly rose two mighty-hearted ones
3473,BOOK IV,"Eager to match their strength in wrestling strain,"
3474,BOOK IV,The son of Tydeus and the giant Aias.
3475,BOOK IV,"Into the midst they strode, and marvelling gazed"
3476,BOOK IV,The Argives on men shapen like to gods.
3477,BOOK IV,"Then grappled they, like lions famine-stung"
3478,BOOK IV,"Fighting amidst the mountains o'er a stag,"
3479,BOOK IV,Whose strength is even-balanced; no whit less
3480,BOOK IV,Is one than other in their deadly rage;
3481,BOOK IV,"So these long time in might were even-matched,"
3482,BOOK IV,Till Aias locked his strong hands round the son
3483,BOOK IV,"Of Tydeus, straining hard to break his back;"
3484,BOOK IV,"But he, with wrestling-craft and strength combined,"
3485,BOOK IV,"Shifted his hip 'neath Telamon's son, and heaved"
3486,BOOK IV,The giant up; with a side-twist wrenched free
3487,BOOK IV,"From Aias' ankle-lock his thigh, and so"
3488,BOOK IV,With one huge shoulder-heave to earth he threw
3489,BOOK IV,"That mighty champion, and himself came down"
3490,BOOK IV,Astride him: then a mighty shout went up.
3491,BOOK IV,"But battle-stormer Aias, chafed in mind,"
3492,BOOK IV,"Sprang up, hot-eager to essay again"
3493,BOOK IV,That grim encounter.  From his terrible hands
3494,BOOK IV,"He dashed the dust, and challenged furiously"
3495,BOOK IV,With a great voice Tydeides: not a whit
3496,BOOK IV,"That other quailed, but rushed to close with him."
3497,BOOK IV,Rolled up the dust in clouds from 'neath their feet:
3498,BOOK IV,Hurtling they met like battling mountain-bulls
3499,BOOK IV,"That clash to prove their dauntless strength, and spurn"
3500,BOOK IV,"The dust, while with their roaring all the hills"
3501,BOOK IV,Re-echo: in their desperate fury these
3502,BOOK IV,"Dash their strong heads together, straining long"
3503,BOOK IV,"Against each other with their massive strength,"
3504,BOOK IV,"Hard-panting in the fierce rage of their strife,"
3505,BOOK IV,While from their mouths drip foam-flakes to the ground;
3506,BOOK IV,So strained they twain with grapple of brawny hands.
3507,BOOK IV,'Neath that hard grip their backs and sinewy necks
3508,BOOK IV,"Cracked, even as when in mountain-glades the trees"
3509,BOOK IV,Dash storm-tormented boughs together.  Oft
3510,BOOK IV,"Tydeides clutched at Aias' brawny thighs,"
3511,BOOK IV,But could not stir his steadfast-rooted feet.
3512,BOOK IV,"Oft Aias hurled his whole weight on him, bowed"
3513,BOOK IV,"His shoulders backward, strove to press him down;"
3514,BOOK IV,And to new grips their hands were shifting aye.
3515,BOOK IV,"All round the gazing people shouted, some"
3516,BOOK IV,"Cheering on glorious Tydeus' son, and some"
3517,BOOK IV,The might of Aias.  Then the giant swung
3518,BOOK IV,"The shoulders of his foe to right, to left;"
3519,BOOK IV,Then gripped him 'neath the waist; with one fierce heave
3520,BOOK IV,And giant effort hurled him like a stone
3521,BOOK IV,To earth.  The floor of Troyland rang again
3522,BOOK IV,As fell Tydeides: shouted all the folk.
3523,BOOK IV,Yet leapt he up all eager to contend
3524,BOOK IV,With giant Aias for the third last fall:
3525,BOOK IV,But Nestor rose and spake unto the twain:
3526,BOOK IV,"""From grapple of wrestling, noble sons, forbear;"
3527,BOOK IV,For all we know that ye be mightiest
3528,BOOK IV,"Of Argives since the great Achilles died."""
3529,BOOK IV,
3530,BOOK IV,"Then these from toil refrained, and from their brows"
3531,BOOK IV,Wiped with their hands the plenteous-streaming sweat:
3532,BOOK IV,"They kissed each other, and forgat their strife."
3533,BOOK IV,"Then Thetis, queen of Goddesses, gave to them"
3534,BOOK IV,Four handmaids; and those strong and aweless ones
3535,BOOK IV,"Marvelled beholding them, for these surpassed"
3536,BOOK IV,"All captive-maids in beauty and household-skill,"
3537,BOOK IV,Save only lovely-tressed Briseis.  These
3538,BOOK IV,"Achilles captive brought from Lesbos' Isle,"
3539,BOOK IV,And in their service joyed.  The first was made
3540,BOOK IV,Stewardess of the feast and lady of meats;
3541,BOOK IV,The second to the feasters poured the wine;
3542,BOOK IV,The third shed water on their hands thereafter;
3543,BOOK IV,"The fourth bare all away, the banquet done."
3544,BOOK IV,"These Tydeus' son and giant Aias shared,"
3545,BOOK IV,"And, parted two and two, unto their ships"
3546,BOOK IV,Sent they those fair and serviceable ones.
3547,BOOK IV,
3548,BOOK IV,"Next, for the play of fists Idomeneus rose,"
3549,BOOK IV,For cunning was he in all athlete-lore;
3550,BOOK IV,"But none came forth to meet him, yielding all"
3551,BOOK IV,"To him, the elder-born, with reverent awe."
3552,BOOK IV,So in their midst gave Thetis unto him
3553,BOOK IV,"A chariot and fleet steeds, which theretofore"
3554,BOOK IV,Mighty Patroclus from the ranks of Troy
3555,BOOK IV,"Drave, when he slew Sarpedon, seed of Zeus,"
3556,BOOK IV,These to his henchmen gave Idomeneus
3557,BOOK IV,To drive unto the ships: himself remained
3558,BOOK IV,Still sitting in the glorious athlete-ring.
3559,BOOK IV,Then Phoenix to the stalwart Argives cried:
3560,BOOK IV,"""Now to Idomeneus the Gods have given"
3561,BOOK IV,"A fair prize uncontested, free of toil"
3562,BOOK IV,"Of mighty arms and shoulders, honouring"
3563,BOOK IV,The elder-born with bloodless victory.
3564,BOOK IV,"But lo, ye younger men, another prize"
3565,BOOK IV,Awaiteth the swift play of cunning hands.
3566,BOOK IV,"Step forth then: gladden great Peleides' soul."""
3567,BOOK IV,
3568,BOOK IV,"He spake, they heard; but each on other looked,"
3569,BOOK IV,"And, loth to essay the contest, all sat still,"
3570,BOOK IV,Till Neleus' son rebuked those laggard souls:
3571,BOOK IV,"""Friends, it were shame that men should shun the play"
3572,BOOK IV,"Of clenched hands, who in that noble sport"
3573,BOOK IV,"Have skill, wherein young men delight, which links"
3574,BOOK IV,Glory to toil.  Ah that my thews were strong
3575,BOOK IV,"As when we held King Pelias' funeral-feast,"
3576,BOOK IV,"I and Acastus, kinsmen joining hands,"
3577,BOOK IV,When I with godlike Polydeuces stood
3578,BOOK IV,"In gauntlet-strife, in even-balanced fray,"
3579,BOOK IV,And when Ancaeus in the wrestlers' ring
3580,BOOK IV,"Mightier than all beside, yet feared and shrank"
3581,BOOK IV,"From me, and dared not strive with me that day,"
3582,BOOK IV,For that ere then amidst the Epeian men--
3583,BOOK IV,"No battle-blenchers they!--I had vanquished him,"
3584,BOOK IV,"For all his might, and dashed him to the dust"
3585,BOOK IV,"By dead Amaryncus' tomb, and thousands round"
3586,BOOK IV,Sat marvelling at my prowess and my strength.
3587,BOOK IV,Therefore against me not a second time
3588,BOOK IV,"Raised he his hands, strong wrestler though he were;"
3589,BOOK IV,And so I won an uncontested prize.
3590,BOOK IV,"But now old age is on me, and many griefs."
3591,BOOK IV,"Therefore I bid you, whom it well beseems,"
3592,BOOK IV,To win the prize; for glory crowns the youth
3593,BOOK IV,"Who bears away the meed of athlete-strife."""
3594,BOOK IV,
3595,BOOK IV,"Stirred by his gallant chiding, a brave man"
3596,BOOK IV,"Rose, son of haughty godlike Panopeus,"
3597,BOOK IV,"The man who framed the Horse, the bane of Troy,"
3598,BOOK IV,Not long thereafter.  None dared meet him now
3599,BOOK IV,"In play of fists, albeit in deadly craft"
3600,BOOK IV,"Of war, when Ares rusheth through the field,"
3601,BOOK IV,He was not cunning.  But for strife of hands
3602,BOOK IV,The fair prize uncontested had been won
3603,BOOK IV,"By stout Epeius--yea, he was at point"
3604,BOOK IV,To bear it thence unto the Achaean ships;
3605,BOOK IV,"But one strode forth to meet him, Theseus' son,"
3606,BOOK IV,"The spearman Acamas, the mighty of heart,"
3607,BOOK IV,Bearing already on his swift hands girt
3608,BOOK IV,"The hard hide-gauntlets, which Evenor's son"
3609,BOOK IV,Agelaus on his prince's hands had drawn
3610,BOOK IV,With courage-kindling words.  The comrades then
3611,BOOK IV,Of Panopeus' princely son for Epeius raised
3612,BOOK IV,A heartening cheer.  He like a lion stood
3613,BOOK IV,"Forth in the midst, his strong hands gauntleted"
3614,BOOK IV,With bull's hide hard as horn.  Loud rang the cheers
3615,BOOK IV,"From side to side of that great throng, to fire"
3616,BOOK IV,The courage of the mighty ones to clash
3617,BOOK IV,"Hands in the gory play.  Sooth, little spur"
3618,BOOK IV,Needed they for their eagerness for fight.
3619,BOOK IV,"But, ere they closed, they flashed out proving blows"
3620,BOOK IV,"To wot if still, as theretofore, their arms"
3621,BOOK IV,"Were limber and lithe, unclogged by toil of war;"
3622,BOOK IV,"Then faced each other, and upraised their hands"
3623,BOOK IV,"With ever-watching eyes, and short quick steps"
3624,BOOK IV,"A-tiptoe, and with ever-shifting feet,"
3625,BOOK IV,Each still eluding other's crushing might.
3626,BOOK IV,Then with a rush they closed like thunder-clouds
3627,BOOK IV,"Hurled on each other by the tempest-blast,"
3628,BOOK IV,"Flashing forth lightnings, while the welkin thrills"
3629,BOOK IV,As clash the clouds and hollow roar the winds;
3630,BOOK IV,So 'neath the hard hide-gauntlets clashed their jaws.
3631,BOOK IV,"Down streamed the blood, and from their brows the sweat"
3632,BOOK IV,Blood-streaked made on the flushed cheeks crimson bars.
3633,BOOK IV,"Fierce without pause they fought, and never flagged"
3634,BOOK IV,"Epeius, but threw all his stormy strength"
3635,BOOK IV,Into his onrush.  Yet did Theseus' son
3636,BOOK IV,"Never lose heart, but baffled the straight blows"
3637,BOOK IV,"Of those strong hands, and by his fighting-craft"
3638,BOOK IV,"Flinging them right and left, leapt in, brought home"
3639,BOOK IV,"A blow to his eyebrow, cutting to the bone."
3640,BOOK IV,Even then with counter-stroke Epeius reached
3641,BOOK IV,"Acamas' temple, and hurled him to the ground."
3642,BOOK IV,"Swift he sprang up, and on his stalwart foe"
3643,BOOK IV,"Rushed, smote his head: as he rushed in again,"
3644,BOOK IV,"The other, slightly swerving, sent his left"
3645,BOOK IV,"Clean to his brow; his right, with all his might"
3646,BOOK IV,"Behind it, to his nose.  Yet Acamas still"
3647,BOOK IV,Warded and struck with all the manifold shifts
3648,BOOK IV,Of fighting-craft.  But now the Achaeans all
3649,BOOK IV,"Bade stop the fight, though eager still were both"
3650,BOOK IV,To strive for coveted victory.  Then came
3651,BOOK IV,"Their henchmen, and the gory gauntlets loosed"
3652,BOOK IV,In haste from those strong hands.  Now drew they breath
3653,BOOK IV,"From that great labour, as they bathed their brows"
3654,BOOK IV,With sponges myriad-pored.  Comrades and friends
3655,BOOK IV,"With pleading words then drew them face to face,"
3656,BOOK IV,"And prayed, ""In friendship straight forget your wrath."""
3657,BOOK IV,So to their comrades' suasion hearkened they;
3658,BOOK IV,For wise men ever bear a placable mind.
3659,BOOK IV,"They kissed each other, and their hearts forgat"
3660,BOOK IV,That bitter strife.  Then Thetis sable-stoled
3661,BOOK IV,Gave to their glad hands two great silver bowls
3662,BOOK IV,"The which Euneus, Jason's warrior son"
3663,BOOK IV,In sea-washed Lemnos to Achilles gave
3664,BOOK IV,To ransom strong Lycaon from his hands.
3665,BOOK IV,These had Hephaestus fashioned for his gift
3666,BOOK IV,"To glorious Dionysus, when he brought"
3667,BOOK IV,"His bride divine to Olympus, Minos' child"
3668,BOOK IV,"Far-famous, whom in sea-washed Dia's isle"
3669,BOOK IV,Theseus unwitting left.  The Wine-god brimmed
3670,BOOK IV,"With nectar these, and gave them to his son;"
3671,BOOK IV,And Thoas at his death to Hypsipyle
3672,BOOK IV,With great possessions left them.  She bequeathed
3673,BOOK IV,"The bowls to her godlike son, who gave them up"
3674,BOOK IV,Unto Achilles for Lycaon's life.
3675,BOOK IV,"The one the son of lordly Theseus took,"
3676,BOOK IV,And goodly Epeius sent to his ship with joy
3677,BOOK IV,The other.  Then their bruises and their scars
3678,BOOK IV,Did Podaleirius tend with loving care.
3679,BOOK IV,"First pressed he out black humours, then his hands"
3680,BOOK IV,Deftly knit up the gashes: salves he laid
3681,BOOK IV,"Thereover, given him by his sire of old,"
3682,BOOK IV,Such as had virtue in one day to heal
3683,BOOK IV,"The deadliest hurts, yea, seeming-cureless wounds."
3684,BOOK IV,"Straight was the smart assuaged, and healed the scars"
3685,BOOK IV,Upon their brows and 'neath their clustering hair
3686,BOOK IV,
3687,BOOK IV,Then for the archery-test Oileus' son
3688,BOOK IV,"Stood forth with Teucer, they which in the race"
3689,BOOK IV,Erewhile contended.  Far away from these
3690,BOOK IV,"Agamemnon, lord of spears, set up a helm"
3691,BOOK IV,"Crested with plumes, and spake: ""The master-shot"
3692,BOOK IV,"Is that which shears the hair-crest clean away."""
3693,BOOK IV,"Then straightway Aias shot his arrow first,"
3694,BOOK IV,And smote the helm-ridge: sharply rang the brass.
3695,BOOK IV,Then Teucer second with most earnest heed
3696,BOOK IV,Shot: the swift shaft hath shorn the plume away.
3697,BOOK IV,"Loud shouted all the people as they gazed,"
3698,BOOK IV,"And praised him without stint, for still his foot"
3699,BOOK IV,"Halted in pain, yet nowise marred his aim"
3700,BOOK IV,When with his hands he sped the flying shaft.
3701,BOOK IV,Then Peleus' bride gave unto him the arms
3702,BOOK IV,"Of godlike Troilus, the goodliest"
3703,BOOK IV,Of all fair sons whom Hecuba had borne
3704,BOOK IV,In hallowed Troy; yet of his goodlihead
3705,BOOK IV,No joy she had; the prowess and the spear
3706,BOOK IV,Of fell Achilles reft his life from him.
3707,BOOK IV,As when a gardener with new-whetted scythe
3708,BOOK IV,"Mows down, ere it may seed, a blade of corn"
3709,BOOK IV,"Or poppy, in a garden dewy-fresh"
3710,BOOK IV,"And blossom-flushed, which by a water-course"
3711,BOOK IV,Crowdeth its blooms--mows it ere it may reach
3712,BOOK IV,"Its goal of bringing offspring to the birth,"
3713,BOOK IV,And with his scythe-sweep makes its life-work vain
3714,BOOK IV,"And barren of all issue, nevermore"
3715,BOOK IV,Now to be fostered by the dews of spring;
3716,BOOK IV,So did Peleides cut down Priam's son
3717,BOOK IV,"The god-like beautiful, the beardless yet"
3718,BOOK IV,"And virgin of a bride, almost a child!"
3719,BOOK IV,Yet the Destroyer Fate had lured him on
3720,BOOK IV,"To war, upon the threshold of glad youth,"
3721,BOOK IV,"When youth is bold, and the heart feels no void."
3722,BOOK IV,
3723,BOOK IV,Forthwith a bar of iron massy and long
3724,BOOK IV,From the swift-speeding hand did many essay
3725,BOOK IV,To hurl; but not an Argive could prevail
3726,BOOK IV,To cast that ponderous mass.  Aias alone
3727,BOOK IV,"Sped it from his strong hand, as in the time"
3728,BOOK IV,Of harvest might a reaper fling from him
3729,BOOK IV,"A dry oak-bough, when all the fields are parched."
3730,BOOK IV,And all men marvelled to behold how far
3731,BOOK IV,Flew from his hand the bronze which scarce two men
3732,BOOK IV,Hard-straining had uplifted from the ground.
3733,BOOK IV,Even this Antaeus' might was wont to hurl
3734,BOOK IV,"Erstwhile, ere the strong hands of Hercules"
3735,BOOK IV,"O'ermastered him.  This, with much spoil beside,"
3736,BOOK IV,"Hercules took, and kept it to make sport"
3737,BOOK IV,For his invincible hand; but afterward
3738,BOOK IV,"Gave it to valiant Peleus, who with him"
3739,BOOK IV,Had smitten fair-towered Ilium's burg renowned;
3740,BOOK IV,"And he to Achilles gave it, whose swift ships"
3741,BOOK IV,"Bare it to Troy, to put him aye in mind"
3742,BOOK IV,"Of his own father, as with eager will"
3743,BOOK IV,"He fought with stalwart Trojans, and to be"
3744,BOOK IV,A worthy test wherewith to prove his strength.
3745,BOOK IV,Even this did Aias from his brawny hand
3746,BOOK IV,Fling far.  So then the Nereid gave to him
3747,BOOK IV,The glorious arms from godlike Memnon stripped.
3748,BOOK IV,Marvelling the Argives gazed on them: they were
3749,BOOK IV,A giant's war-gear.  Laughing a glad laugh
3750,BOOK IV,That man renowned received them: he alone
3751,BOOK IV,Could wear them on his brawny limbs; they seemed
3752,BOOK IV,As they had even been moulded to his frame.
3753,BOOK IV,"The great bar thence he bore withal, to be"
3754,BOOK IV,His joy when he was fain of athlete-toil.
3755,BOOK IV,
3756,BOOK IV,Still sped the contests on; and many rose
3757,BOOK IV,Now for the leaping.  Far beyond the marks
3758,BOOK IV,Of all the rest brave Agapenor sprang:
3759,BOOK IV,Loud shouted all for that victorious leap;
3760,BOOK IV,And Thetis gave him the fair battle-gear
3761,BOOK IV,"Of mighty Cycnus, who had smitten first"
3762,BOOK IV,"Protesilaus, then had reft the life"
3763,BOOK IV,"From many more, till Peleus' son slew him"
3764,BOOK IV,First of the chiefs of grief-enshrouded Troy.
3765,BOOK IV,
3766,BOOK IV,"Next, in the javelin-cast Euryalus"
3767,BOOK IV,"Hurled far beyond all rivals, while the folk"
3768,BOOK IV,"Shouted aloud: no archer, so they deemed,"
3769,BOOK IV,Could speed a winged shaft farther than his cast;
3770,BOOK IV,Therefore the Aeacid hero's mother gave
3771,BOOK IV,"To him a deep wide silver oil-flask, ta'en"
3772,BOOK IV,"By Achilles in possession, when his spear"
3773,BOOK IV,"Slew Mynes, and he spoiled Lyrnessus' wealth."
3774,BOOK IV,
3775,BOOK IV,Then fiery-hearted Aias eagerly
3776,BOOK IV,"Rose, challenging to strife of hands and feet"
3777,BOOK IV,The mightiest hero there; but marvelling
3778,BOOK IV,"They marked his mighty thews, and no man dared"
3779,BOOK IV,Confront him.  Chilling dread had palsied all
3780,BOOK IV,"Their courage: from their hearts they feared him, lest"
3781,BOOK IV,His hands invincible should all to-break
3782,BOOK IV,"His adversary's face, and naught but pain"
3783,BOOK IV,Be that man's meed.  But at the last all men
3784,BOOK IV,"Made signs to battle-bider Euryalus,"
3785,BOOK IV,For well they knew him skilled in fighting-craft;
3786,BOOK IV,"But he too feared that giant, and he cried:"
3787,BOOK IV,"""Friends, any other Achaean, whom ye will,"
3788,BOOK IV,Blithe will I face; but mighty Alas--no!
3789,BOOK IV,Far doth he overmatch me.  He will rend
3790,BOOK IV,"Mine heart, if in the onset anger rise"
3791,BOOK IV,"Within him: from his hands invincible,"
3792,BOOK IV,"I trow, I should not win to the ships alive."""
3793,BOOK IV,
3794,BOOK IV,Loud laughed they all: but glowed with triumph-joy
3795,BOOK IV,The heart of Aias.  Gleaming talents twain
3796,BOOK IV,"Of silver he from Thetis' hands received,"
3797,BOOK IV,His uncontested prize.  His stately height
3798,BOOK IV,"Called to her mind her dear son, and she sighed."
3799,BOOK IV,
3800,BOOK IV,They which had skill in chariot-driving then
3801,BOOK IV,Rose at the contest's summons eagerly:
3802,BOOK IV,"Menelaus first, Eurypylus bold in fight,"
3803,BOOK IV,"Eumelus, Thoas, godlike Polypoetes"
3804,BOOK IV,"Harnessed their steeds, and led them to the cars"
3805,BOOK IV,All panting for the joy of victory.
3806,BOOK IV,Then rode they in a glittering chariot rank
3807,BOOK IV,"Out to one place, to a stretch of sand, and stood"
3808,BOOK IV,Ranged at the starting-line.  The reins they grasped
3809,BOOK IV,"In strong hands quickly, while the chariot-steeds"
3810,BOOK IV,"Shoulder to shoulder fretted, all afire"
3811,BOOK IV,"To take the lead at starting, pawed the sand,"
3812,BOOK IV,"Pricked ears, and o'er their frontlets flung the foam."
3813,BOOK IV,With sudden-stiffened sinews those ear-lords
3814,BOOK IV,Lashed with their whips the tempest-looted steeds;
3815,BOOK IV,Then swift as Harpies sprang they forth; they strained
3816,BOOK IV,"Furiously at the harness, onward whirling"
3817,BOOK IV,The chariots bounding ever from the earth.
3818,BOOK IV,"Thou couldst not see a wheel-track, no, nor print"
3819,BOOK IV,Of hoof upon the sand--they verily flew.
3820,BOOK IV,Up from the plain the dust-clouds to the sky
3821,BOOK IV,"Soared, like the smoke of burning, or a mist"
3822,BOOK IV,Rolled round the mountain-forelands by the might
3823,BOOK IV,"Of the dark South-wind or the West, when wakes"
3824,BOOK IV,"A tempest, when the hill-sides stream with rain."
3825,BOOK IV,Burst to the front Eumelus' steeds: behind
3826,BOOK IV,Close pressed the team of godlike Thoas: shouts
3827,BOOK IV,"Still answered shouts that cheered each chariot, while"
3828,BOOK IV,Onward they swept across the wide-wayed plain.
3829,BOOK IV,
3830,((LACUNA)),((LACUNA))
3831,((LACUNA)),
3832,((LACUNA)),"""From hallowed Elis, when he had achieved"
3833,((LACUNA)),"A mighty triumph, in that he outstripped"
3834,((LACUNA)),"The swift ear of Oenomaus evil-souled,"
3835,((LACUNA)),The ruthless slayer of youths who sought to wed
3836,((LACUNA)),His daughter Hippodameia passing-wise.
3837,((LACUNA)),"Yet even he, for all his chariot-lore,"
3838,((LACUNA)),Had no such fleetfoot steeds as Atreus' son--
3839,((LACUNA)),"Far slower!--the wind is in the feet of these."""
3840,((LACUNA)),
3841,((LACUNA)),"So spake he, giving glory to the might"
3842,((LACUNA)),"Of those good steeds, and to Atreides' self;"
3843,((LACUNA)),And filled with joy was Menelaus' soul.
3844,((LACUNA)),Straightway his henchmen from the yoke-band loosed
3845,((LACUNA)),"The panting team, and all those chariot-lords,"
3846,((LACUNA)),"Who in the race had striven, now unyoked"
3847,((LACUNA)),Their tempest-footed steeds.  Podaleirius then
3848,((LACUNA)),Hasted to spread salves over all the wounds
3849,((LACUNA)),"Of Thoas and Eurypylus, gashes scored"
3850,((LACUNA)),Upon their frames when from the cars they fell
3851,((LACUNA)),But Menelaus with exceeding joy
3852,((LACUNA)),"Of victory glowed, when Thetis lovely-tressed"
3853,((LACUNA)),"Gave him a golden cup, the chief possession"
3854,((LACUNA)),Once of Eetion the godlike; ere
3855,((LACUNA)),Achilles spoiled the far-famed burg of Thebes.
3856,((LACUNA)),
3857,((LACUNA)),Then horsemen riding upon horses came
3858,((LACUNA)),Down to the course: they grasped in hand the whip
3859,((LACUNA)),"And bounding from the earth bestrode their steeds,"
3860,((LACUNA)),The while with foaming mouths the coursers champed
3861,((LACUNA)),"The bits, and pawed the ground, and fretted aye"
3862,((LACUNA)),To dash into the course.  Forth from the line
3863,((LACUNA)),"Swiftly they darted, eager for the strife,"
3864,((LACUNA)),Wild as the blasts of roaring Boreas
3865,((LACUNA)),"Or shouting Notus, when with hurricane-swoop"
3866,((LACUNA)),"He heaves the wide sea high, when in the east"
3867,((LACUNA)),Uprises the disastrous Altar-star
3868,((LACUNA)),Bringing calamity to seafarers;
3869,((LACUNA)),"So swift they rushed, spurning with flying feet"
3870,((LACUNA)),The deep dust on the plain.  The riders cried
3871,((LACUNA)),"Each to his steed, and ever plied the lash"
3872,((LACUNA)),And shook the reins about the clashing bits.
3873,((LACUNA)),On strained the horses: from the people rose
3874,((LACUNA)),A shouting like the roaring of a sea.
3875,((LACUNA)),"On, on across the level plain they flew;"
3876,((LACUNA)),And now the flashing-footed Argive steed
3877,((LACUNA)),"By Sthenelus bestridden, had won the race,"
3878,((LACUNA)),"But from the course he swerved, and o'er the plain"
3879,((LACUNA)),"Once and again rushed wide; nor Capaneus' son,"
3880,((LACUNA)),"Good horseman though he were, could turn him back"
3881,((LACUNA)),"By rein or whip, because that steed was strange"
3882,((LACUNA)),Still to the race-course; yet of lineage
3883,((LACUNA)),"Noble was he, for in his veins the blood"
3884,((LACUNA)),"Of swift Arion ran, the foal begotten"
3885,((LACUNA)),"By the loud-piping West-wind on a Harpy,"
3886,((LACUNA)),"The fleetest of all earth-born steeds, whose feet"
3887,((LACUNA)),Could race against his father's swiftest blasts.
3888,((LACUNA)),Him did the Blessed to Adrastus give:
3889,((LACUNA)),"And from him sprang the steed of Sthenelus,"
3890,((LACUNA)),Which Tydeus' son had given unto his friend
3891,((LACUNA)),In hallowed Troyland.  Filled with confidence
3892,((LACUNA)),In those swift feet his rider led him forth
3893,((LACUNA)),"Unto the contest of the steeds that day,"
3894,((LACUNA)),Looking his horsemanship should surely win
3895,((LACUNA)),Renown: yet victory gladdened not his heart
3896,((LACUNA)),In that great struggle for Achilles' prizes;
3897,((LACUNA)),"Nay, swift albeit he was, the King of Men"
3898,((LACUNA)),"By skill outraced him.  Shouted all the folk,"
3899,((LACUNA)),"""Glory to Agamemnon!""  Yet they acclaimed"
3900,((LACUNA)),"The steed of valiant Sthenelus and his lord,"
3901,((LACUNA)),For that the fiery flying of his feet
3902,((LACUNA)),"Still won him second place, albeit oft"
3903,((LACUNA)),Wide of the course he swerved.  Then Thetis gave
3904,((LACUNA)),"To Atreus' son, while laughed his lips for joy,"
3905,((LACUNA)),God-sprung Polydorus' breastplate silver-wrought.
3906,((LACUNA)),"To Sthenelus Asteropaeus' massy helm,"
3907,((LACUNA)),"Two lances, and a taslet strong, she gave."
3908,((LACUNA)),"Yea, and to all the riders who that day"
3909,((LACUNA)),Came at Achilles' funeral-feast to strive
3910,((LACUNA)),"She gave gifts.  But the son of the old war-lord,"
3911,((LACUNA)),"Laertes, inly grieved to be withheld"
3912,((LACUNA)),"From contests of the strong, how fain soe'er,"
3913,((LACUNA)),By that sore wound which Alcon dealt to him
3914,((LACUNA)),In the grim fight around dead Aeacas' son.
3915,((LACUNA)),
3916,((LACUNA)),
3917,((LACUNA)),
3918,BOOK V,BOOK V
3919,BOOK V,
3920,BOOK V,How the Arms of Achilles were cause of madness and death unto Aias.
3921,BOOK V,
3922,BOOK V,
3923,BOOK V,"So when all other contests had an end,"
3924,BOOK V,Thetis the Goddess laid down in the midst
3925,BOOK V,Great-souled Achilles' arms divinely wrought;
3926,BOOK V,And all around flashed out the cunning work
3927,BOOK V,Wherewith the Fire-god overchased the shield
3928,BOOK V,"Fashioned for Aeacus' son, the dauntless-souled."
3929,BOOK V,
3930,BOOK V,Inwrought upon that labour of a God
3931,BOOK V,"Were first high heaven and cloudland, and beneath"
3932,BOOK V,"Lay earth and sea: the winds, the clouds were there,"
3933,BOOK V,"The moon and sun, each in its several place;"
3934,BOOK V,"There too were all the stars that, fixed in heaven,"
3935,BOOK V,Are borne in its eternal circlings round.
3936,BOOK V,Above and through all was the infinite air
3937,BOOK V,Where to and fro flit birds of slender beak:
3938,BOOK V,"Thou hadst said they lived, and floated on the breeze."
3939,BOOK V,"Here Tethys' all-embracing arms were wrought,"
3940,BOOK V,And Ocean's fathomless flow.  The outrushing flood
3941,BOOK V,Of rivers crying to the echoing hills
3942,BOOK V,"All round, to right, to left, rolled o'er the land."
3943,BOOK V,
3944,BOOK V,"Round it rose league-long mountain-ridges, haunts"
3945,BOOK V,Of terrible lions and foul jackals: there
3946,BOOK V,Fierce bears and panthers prowled; with these were seen
3947,BOOK V,Wild boars that whetted deadly-clashing tusks
3948,BOOK V,In grimly-frothing jaws.  There hunters sped
3949,BOOK V,"After the hounds: beaters with stone and dart,"
3950,BOOK V,"To the life portrayed, toiled in the woodland sport."
3951,BOOK V,
3952,BOOK V,"And there were man-devouring wars, and all"
3953,BOOK V,Horrors of fight: slain men were falling down
3954,BOOK V,Mid horse-hoofs; and the likeness of a plain
3955,BOOK V,Blood-drenched was on that shield invincible.
3956,BOOK V,"Panic was there, and Dread, and ghastly Enyo"
3957,BOOK V,"With limbs all gore-bespattered hideously,"
3958,BOOK V,"And deadly Strife, and the Avenging Spirits"
3959,BOOK V,"Fierce-hearted--she, still goading warriors on"
3960,BOOK V,"To the onset they, outbreathing breath of fire."
3961,BOOK V,Around them hovered the relentless Fates;
3962,BOOK V,Beside them Battle incarnate onward pressed
3963,BOOK V,"Yelling, and from their limbs streamed blood and sweat."
3964,BOOK V,There were the ruthless Gorgons: through their hair
3965,BOOK V,Horribly serpents coiled with flickering tongues.
3966,BOOK V,A measureless marvel was that cunning work
3967,BOOK V,Of things that made men shudder to behold
3968,BOOK V,Seeming as though they verily lived and moved.
3969,BOOK V,
3970,BOOK V,"And while here all war's marvels were portrayed,"
3971,BOOK V,Yonder were all the works of lovely peace.
3972,BOOK V,The myriad tribes of much-enduring men
3973,BOOK V,Dwelt in fair cities.  Justice watched o'er all.
3974,BOOK V,To diverse toils they set their hands; the fields
3975,BOOK V,Were harvest-laden; earth her increase bore.
3976,BOOK V,
3977,BOOK V,Most steeply rose on that god-laboured work
3978,BOOK V,"The rugged flanks of holy Honour's mount,"
3979,BOOK V,And there upon a palm-tree throned she sat
3980,BOOK V,"Exalted, and her hands reached up to heaven."
3981,BOOK V,"All round her, paths broken by many rocks"
3982,BOOK V,Thwarted the climbers' feet; by those steep tracks
3983,BOOK V,Daunted ye saw returning many folk:
3984,BOOK V,Few won by sweat of toil the sacred height.
3985,BOOK V,
3986,BOOK V,And there were reapers moving down long swaths
3987,BOOK V,Swinging the whetted sickles: 'neath their hands
3988,BOOK V,The hot work sped to its close.  Hard after these
3989,BOOK V,"Many sheaf-binders followed, and the work"
3990,BOOK V,Grew passing great.  With yoke-bands on their necks
3991,BOOK V,"Oxen were there, whereof some drew the wains"
3992,BOOK V,"Heaped high with full-eared sheaves, and further on"
3993,BOOK V,"Were others ploughing, and the glebe showed black"
3994,BOOK V,Behind them.  Youths with ever-busy goads
3995,BOOK V,Followed: a world of toil was there portrayed.
3996,BOOK V,
3997,BOOK V,"And there a banquet was, with pipe and harp,"
3998,BOOK V,"Dances of maids, and flashing feet of boys,"
3999,BOOK V,"All in swift movement, like to living souls."
4000,BOOK V,
4001,BOOK V,Hard by the dance and its sweet winsomeness
4002,BOOK V,Out of the sea was rising lovely-crowned
4003,BOOK V,"Cypris, foam-blossoms still upon her hair;"
4004,BOOK V,And round her hovered smiling witchingly
4005,BOOK V,"Desire, and danced the Graces lovely-tressed."
4006,BOOK V,
4007,BOOK V,And there were lordly Nereus' Daughters shown
4008,BOOK V,Leading their sister up from the wide sea
4009,BOOK V,To her espousals with the warrior-king.
4010,BOOK V,And round her all the Immortals banqueted
4011,BOOK V,On Pelion's ridge far-stretching.  All about
4012,BOOK V,"Lush dewy watermeads there were, bestarred"
4013,BOOK V,"With flowers innumerable, grassy groves,"
4014,BOOK V,And springs with clear transparent water bright.
4015,BOOK V,
4016,BOOK V,"There ships with sighing sheets swept o'er the sea,"
4017,BOOK V,"Some beating up to windward, some that sped"
4018,BOOK V,"Before a following wind, and round them heaved"
4019,BOOK V,The melancholy surge.  Seared shipmen rushed
4020,BOOK V,"This way and that, adread for tempest-gusts,"
4021,BOOK V,"Hauling the white sails in, to 'scape the death--"
4022,BOOK V,"It all seemed real--some tugging at the oars,"
4023,BOOK V,While the dark sea on either side the ship
4024,BOOK V,Grew hoary 'neath the swiftly-plashing blades.
4025,BOOK V,
4026,BOOK V,And there triumphant the Earth-shaker rode
4027,BOOK V,Amid sea-monsters' stormy-footed steeds
4028,BOOK V,"Drew him, and seemed alive, as o'er the deep"
4029,BOOK V,"They raced, oft smitten by the golden whip."
4030,BOOK V,"Around their path of flight the waves fell smooth,"
4031,BOOK V,And all before them was unrippled calm.
4032,BOOK V,Dolphins on either hand about their king
4033,BOOK V,"Swarmed, in wild rapture of homage bowing backs,"
4034,BOOK V,And seemed like live things o'er the hazy sea
4035,BOOK V,"Swimming, albeit all of silver wrought."
4036,BOOK V,
4037,BOOK V,Marvels of untold craft were imaged there
4038,BOOK V,By cunning-souled Hephaestus' deathless hands
4039,BOOK V,Upon the shield.  And Ocean's fathomless flood
4040,BOOK V,"Clasped like a garland all the outer rim,"
4041,BOOK V,And compassed all the strong shield's curious work.
4042,BOOK V,
4043,BOOK V,And therebeside the massy helmet lay.
4044,BOOK V,Zeus in his wrath was set upon the crest
4045,BOOK V,Throned on heaven's dome; the Immortals all around
4046,BOOK V,Fierce-battling with the Titans fought for Zeus.
4047,BOOK V,"Already were their foes enwrapped with flame,"
4048,BOOK V,For thick and fast as snowflakes poured from heaven
4049,BOOK V,"The thunderbolts: the might of Zeus was roused,"
4050,BOOK V,And burning giants seemed to breathe out flames.
4051,BOOK V,
4052,BOOK V,"And therebeside the fair strong corslet lay,"
4053,BOOK V,"Unpierceable, which clasped Peleides once:"
4054,BOOK V,"There were the greaves close-lapping, light alone"
4055,BOOK V,To Achilles; massy of mould and huge they were.
4056,BOOK V,
4057,BOOK V,And hard by flashed the sword whose edge and point
4058,BOOK V,"No mail could turn, with golden belt, and sheath"
4059,BOOK V,"Of silver, and with haft of ivory:"
4060,BOOK V,Brightest amid those wondrous arms it shone.
4061,BOOK V,"Stretched on the earth thereby was that dread spear,"
4062,BOOK V,"Long as the tall-tressed pines of Pelion,"
4063,BOOK V,Still breathing out the reek of Hector's blood.
4064,BOOK V,
4065,BOOK V,Then mid the Argives Thetis sable-stoled
4066,BOOK V,In her deep sorrow for Achilles spake;
4067,BOOK V,"""Now all the athlete-prizes have been won"
4068,BOOK V,Which I set forth in sorrow for my child.
4069,BOOK V,Now let that mightiest of the Argives come
4070,BOOK V,Who rescued from the foe my dead: to him
4071,BOOK V,These glorious and immortal arms I give
4072,BOOK V,"Which even the blessed Deathless joyed to see."""
4073,BOOK V,
4074,BOOK V,"Then rose in rivalry, each claiming them,"
4075,BOOK V,"Laertes' seed and godlike Telamon's son,"
4076,BOOK V,"Aias, the mightiest far of Danaan men:"
4077,BOOK V,He seemed the star that in the glittering sky
4078,BOOK V,"Outshines the host of heaven, Hesperus,"
4079,BOOK V,So splendid by Peleides' arms he stood;
4080,BOOK V,"""And let these judge,"" he cried, ""Idomeneus,"
4081,BOOK V,"Nestor, and kingly-counselled Agamemnon,"""
4082,BOOK V,"For these, he weened, would sureliest know the truth"
4083,BOOK V,Of deeds wrought in that glorious battle-toil.
4084,BOOK V,"""To these I also trust most utterly,"""
4085,BOOK V,"Odysseus said, ""for prudent of their wit"
4086,BOOK V,"Be these, and princeliest of all Danaan men."""
4087,BOOK V,
4088,BOOK V,But to Idomeneus and Atreus' son
4089,BOOK V,"Spake Nestor apart, and willingly they heard:"
4090,BOOK V,"""Friends, a great woe and unendurable"
4091,BOOK V,"This day the careless Gods have laid on us,"
4092,BOOK V,In that into this lamentable strife
4093,BOOK V,Aias the mighty hath been thrust by them
4094,BOOK V,"Against Odysseus passing-wise.  For he,"
4095,BOOK V,To whichsoe'er God gives the victor's glory--
4096,BOOK V,"O yea, he shall rejoice!  But he that loseth--"
4097,BOOK V,All for the grief in all the Danaans' hearts
4098,BOOK V,For him!  And ours shall be the deepest grief
4099,BOOK V,Of all; for that man will not in the war
4100,BOOK V,Stand by us as of old.  A sorrowful day
4101,BOOK V,"It shall be for us, whichsoe'er of these"
4102,BOOK V,"Shall break into fierce anger, seeing they"
4103,BOOK V,"Are of our heroes chiefest, this in war,"
4104,BOOK V,"And that in counsel.  Hearken then to me,"
4105,BOOK V,"Seeing that I am older far than ye,"
4106,BOOK V,Not by a few years only: with mine age
4107,BOOK V,"Is prudence joined, for I have suffered and wrought"
4108,BOOK V,"Much; and in counsel ever the old man,"
4109,BOOK V,"Who knoweth much, excelleth younger men."
4110,BOOK V,Therefore let us ordain to judge this cause
4111,BOOK V,"'Twixt godlike Aias and war-fain Odysseus,"
4112,BOOK V,Our Trojan captives.  They shall say whom most
4113,BOOK V,"Our foes dread, and who saved Peleides' corse"
4114,BOOK V,"From that most deadly fight.  Lo, in our midst"
4115,BOOK V,"Be many spear-won Trojans, thralls of Fate;"
4116,BOOK V,"And these will pass true judgment on these twain,"
4117,BOOK V,"To neither showing favour, since they hate"
4118,BOOK V,"Alike all authors of their misery."""
4119,BOOK V,
4120,BOOK V,He spake: replied Agamemnon lord of spears:
4121,BOOK V,"""Ancient, there is none other in our midst"
4122,BOOK V,"Wiser than thou, of Danaans young or old,"
4123,BOOK V,In that thou say'st that unforgiving wrath
4124,BOOK V,Will burn in him to whom the Gods herein
4125,BOOK V,Deny the victory; for these which strive
4126,BOOK V,Are both our chiefest.  Therefore mine heart too
4127,BOOK V,"Is set on this, that to the thralls of war"
4128,BOOK V,This judgment we commit: the loser then
4129,BOOK V,Shall against Troy devise his deadly work
4130,BOOK V,"Of vengeance, and shall not be wroth with us."""
4131,BOOK V,
4132,BOOK V,"He spake, and these three, being of one mind,"
4133,BOOK V,In hearing of all men refused to judge
4134,BOOK V,Judgment so thankless: they would none of it.
4135,BOOK V,Therefore they set the high-born sons of Troy
4136,BOOK V,"There in the midst, spear-thralls although they were,"
4137,BOOK V,To give just judgment in the warriors' strife.
4138,BOOK V,"Then in hot anger Aias rose, and spake:"
4139,BOOK V,"""Odysseus, frantic soul, why hath a God"
4140,BOOK V,"Deluded thee, to make thee hold thyself"
4141,BOOK V,My peer in might invincible?  Dar'st thou say
4142,BOOK V,"That thou, when slain Achilles lay in dust,"
4143,BOOK V,"When round him swarmed the Trojans, didst bear back"
4144,BOOK V,"That furious throng, when I amidst them hurled"
4145,BOOK V,"Death, and thou coweredst away?  Thy dam"
4146,BOOK V,Bare thee a craven and a weakling wretch
4147,BOOK V,"Frail in comparison of me, as is"
4148,BOOK V,A cur beside a lion thunder-voiced!
4149,BOOK V,"No battle-biding heart is in thy breast,"
4150,BOOK V,But wiles and treachery be all thy care.
4151,BOOK V,Hast thou forgotten how thou didst shrink back
4152,BOOK V,From faring with Achaea's gathered host
4153,BOOK V,"To Ilium's holy burg, till Atreus' sons"
4154,BOOK V,"Forced thee, the cowering craven, how loth soe'er,"
4155,BOOK V,To follow them--would God thou hadst never come!
4156,BOOK V,For by thy counsel left we in Lemnos' isle
4157,BOOK V,Groaning in agony Poeas' son renowned.
4158,BOOK V,And not for him alone was ruin devised
4159,BOOK V,Of thee; for godlike Palamedes too
4160,BOOK V,"Didst thou contrive destruction--ha, he was"
4161,BOOK V,Alike in battle and council better than thou!
4162,BOOK V,"And now thou dar'st to rise up against me,"
4163,BOOK V,"Neither remembering my kindness, nor"
4164,BOOK V,Having respect unto the mightier man
4165,BOOK V,"Who rescued thee erewhile, when thou didst quaff"
4166,BOOK V,"In fight before the onset of thy foes,"
4167,BOOK V,"When thou, forsaken of all Greeks beside,"
4168,BOOK V,"Midst tumult of the fray, wast fleeing too!"
4169,BOOK V,Oh that in that great fight Zeus' self had stayed
4170,BOOK V,My dauntless might with thunder from his heaven!
4171,BOOK V,Then with their two-edged swords the Trojan men
4172,BOOK V,"Had hewn thee limb from limb, and to their dogs"
4173,BOOK V,Had cast thy carrion!  Then thou hadst not presumed
4174,BOOK V,"To meet me, trusting in thy trickeries!"
4175,BOOK V,"Wretch, wherefore, if thou vauntest thee in might"
4176,BOOK V,"Beyond all others, hast thou set thy ships"
4177,BOOK V,"In the line's centre, screened from foes, nor dared"
4178,BOOK V,"As I, on the far wing to draw them up?"
4179,BOOK V,Because thou wast afraid!  Not thou it was
4180,BOOK V,Who savedst from devouring fire the ships;
4181,BOOK V,But I with heart unquailing there stood fast
4182,BOOK V,"Facing the fire and Hector ay, even he"
4183,BOOK V,Gave back before me everywhere in fight.
4184,BOOK V,Thou--thou didst fear him aye with deadly fear!
4185,BOOK V,"Oh, had this our contention been but set"
4186,BOOK V,"Amidst that very battle, when the roar"
4187,BOOK V,Of conflict rose around Achilles slain!
4188,BOOK V,Then had thine own eyes seen me bearing forth
4189,BOOK V,Out from the battle's heart and fury of foes
4190,BOOK V,That goodly armour and its hero lord
4191,BOOK V,Unto the tents.  But here thou canst but trust
4192,BOOK V,"In cunning speech, and covetest a place"
4193,BOOK V,Amongst the mighty!  Thou--thou hast not strength
4194,BOOK V,"To wear Achilles' arms invincible,"
4195,BOOK V,Nor sway his massy spear in thy weak hands!
4196,BOOK V,But I they are verily moulded to my frame:
4197,BOOK V,"Yea, seemly it is I wear those glorious arms,"
4198,BOOK V,Who shall not shame a God's gifts passing fair.
4199,BOOK V,But wherefore for Achilles' glorious arms
4200,BOOK V,With words discourteous wrangling stand we here?
4201,BOOK V,"Come, let us try in strife with brazen spears"
4202,BOOK V,Who of us twain is best in murderous right!
4203,BOOK V,For silver-footed Thetis set in the midst
4204,BOOK V,"This prize for prowess, not for pestilent words."
4205,BOOK V,In folkmote may men have some use for words:
4206,BOOK V,"In pride of prowess I know me above thee far,"
4207,BOOK V,"And great Achilles' lineage is mine own."""
4208,BOOK V,
4209,BOOK V,He spake: with scornful glance and bitter speech
4210,BOOK V,Odysseus the resourceful chode with him:
4211,BOOK V,"""Aias, unbridled tongue, why these vain words"
4212,BOOK V,"To me?  Thou hast called me pestilent, niddering,"
4213,BOOK V,And weakling: yet I boast me better far
4214,BOOK V,"Than thou in wit and speech, which things increase"
4215,BOOK V,"The strength of men.  Lo, how the craggy rock,"
4216,BOOK V,"Adamantine though it seem, the hewers of stone"
4217,BOOK V,Amid the hills by wisdom undermine
4218,BOOK V,"Full lightly, and by wisdom shipmen cross"
4219,BOOK V,"The thunderous-plunging sea, when mountain-high"
4220,BOOK V,"It surgeth, and by craft do hunters quell"
4221,BOOK V,"Strong lions, panthers, boars, yea, all the brood"
4222,BOOK V,Of wild things.  Furious-hearted bulls are tamed
4223,BOOK V,To bear the yoke-bands by device of men.
4224,BOOK V,"Yea, all things are by wit accomplished.  Still"
4225,BOOK V,It is the man who knoweth that excels
4226,BOOK V,The witless man alike in toils and counsels.
4227,BOOK V,For my keen wit did Oeneus' valiant son
4228,BOOK V,Choose me of all men with him to draw nigh
4229,BOOK V,"To Hector's watchmen: yea, and mighty deeds"
4230,BOOK V,We twain accomplished.  I it was who brought
4231,BOOK V,"To Atreus' sons Peleides far-renowned,"
4232,BOOK V,Their battle-helper.  Whensoe'er the host
4233,BOOK V,"Needeth some other champion, not for the sake"
4234,BOOK V,"Of thine hands will he come, nor by the rede"
4235,BOOK V,Of other Argives: of Achaeans I
4236,BOOK V,Alone will draw him with soft suasive words
4237,BOOK V,To where strong men are warring.  Mighty power
4238,BOOK V,"The tongue hath over men, when courtesy"
4239,BOOK V,Inspires it.  Valour is a deedless thing;
4240,BOOK V,And bulk and big assemblage of a man
4241,BOOK V,"Cometh to naught, by wisdom unattended."
4242,BOOK V,But unto me the Immortals gave both strength
4243,BOOK V,"And wisdom, and unto the Argive host"
4244,BOOK V,"Made me a blessing.  Nor, as thou hast said,"
4245,BOOK V,Hast thou in time past saved me when in flight
4246,BOOK V,"From foes.  I never fled, but steadfastly"
4247,BOOK V,Withstood the charge of all the Trojan host.
4248,BOOK V,Furious the enemy came on like a flood
4249,BOOK V,But I by might of hands cut short the thread
4250,BOOK V,Of many lives.  Herein thou sayest not true
4251,BOOK V,"Me in the fray thou didst not shield nor save,"
4252,BOOK V,"But for thine own life roughtest, lest a spear"
4253,BOOK V,Should pierce thy back if thou shouldst turn to flee
4254,BOOK V,"From war.  My ships?  I drew them up mid-line,"
4255,BOOK V,"Not dreading the battle-fury of any foe,"
4256,BOOK V,But to bring healing unto Atreus' sons
4257,BOOK V,Of war's calamities: and thou didst set
4258,BOOK V,"Far from their help thy ships.  Nay more, I seamed"
4259,BOOK V,"With cruel stripes my body, and entered so"
4260,BOOK V,"The Trojans' burg, that I might learn of them"
4261,BOOK V,All their devisings for this troublous war.
4262,BOOK V,Nor ever I dreaded Hector's spear; myself
4263,BOOK V,"Rose mid the foremost, eager for the fight,"
4264,BOOK V,"When, prowess-confident, he defied us all."
4265,BOOK V,"Yea, in the fight around Achilles, I"
4266,BOOK V,Slew foes far more than thou; 'twas I who saved
4267,BOOK V,The dead king with this armour.  Not a whit
4268,BOOK V,"I dread thy spear now, but my grievous hurt"
4269,BOOK V,"With pain still vexeth me, the wound I gat"
4270,BOOK V,In fighting for these arms and their slain lord.
4271,BOOK V,"In me as in Achilles is Zeus' blood."""
4272,BOOK V,
4273,BOOK V,He spake; strong Aias answered him again.
4274,BOOK V,"""Most cunning and most pestilent of men,"
4275,BOOK V,"Nor I, nor any other Argive, saw"
4276,BOOK V,"Thee toiling in that fray, when Trojans strove"
4277,BOOK V,Fiercely to hale away Achilles slain.
4278,BOOK V,My might it was that with the spear unstrung
4279,BOOK V,"The knees of some in fight, and others thrilled"
4280,BOOK V,With panic as they pressed on ceaselessly.
4281,BOOK V,"Then fled they in dire straits, as geese or cranes"
4282,BOOK V,Flee from an eagle swooping as they feed
4283,BOOK V,"Along a grassy meadow; so, in dread"
4284,BOOK V,The Trojans shrinking backward from my spear
4285,BOOK V,"And lightening sword, fled into Ilium"
4286,BOOK V,To 'scape destruction.  If thy might came there
4287,BOOK V,"Ever at all, not anywhere nigh me"
4288,BOOK V,With foes thou foughtest: somewhere far aloot
4289,BOOK V,"Mid other ranks thou toiledst, nowhere nigh"
4290,BOOK V,"Achilles, where the one great battle raged."""
4291,BOOK V,
4292,BOOK V,He spake; replied Odysseus the shrewd heart:
4293,BOOK V,"""Aias, I hold myself no worse than thou"
4294,BOOK V,"In wit or might, how goodly in outward show"
4295,BOOK V,"Thou be soever.  Nay, I am keener far"
4296,BOOK V,Of wit than thou in all the Argives' eyes.
4297,BOOK V,In battle-prowess do I equal thee
4298,BOOK V,"Haply surpass; and this the Trojans know,"
4299,BOOK V,Who tremble when they see me from afar.
4300,BOOK V,"Aye, thou too know'st, and others know my strength"
4301,BOOK V,"By that hard struggle in the wrestling-match,"
4302,BOOK V,When Peleus' son set glorious prizes forth
4303,BOOK V,"Beside the barrow of Patroclus slain."""
4304,BOOK V,
4305,BOOK V,So spake Laertes' son the world-renowned.
4306,BOOK V,Then on that strife disastrous of the strong
4307,BOOK V,The sons of Troy gave judgment.  Victory
4308,BOOK V,And those immortal arms awarded they
4309,BOOK V,With one consent to Odysseus mighty in war.
4310,BOOK V,Greatly his soul rejoiced; but one deep groan
4311,BOOK V,Brake from the Greeks.  Then Aias' noble might
4312,BOOK V,Stood frozen stiff; and suddenly fell on him
4313,BOOK V,Dark wilderment; all blood within his frame
4314,BOOK V,"Boiled, and his gall swelled, bursting forth in flood."
4315,BOOK V,Against his liver heaved his bowels; his heart
4316,BOOK V,With anguished pangs was thrilled; fierce stabbing throes
4317,BOOK V,Shot through the filmy veil 'twixt bone and brain;
4318,BOOK V,And darkness and confusion wrapped his mind.
4319,BOOK V,With fixed eyes staring on the ground he stood
4320,BOOK V,Still as a statue.  Then his sorrowing friends
4321,BOOK V,"Closed round him, led him to the shapely ships,"
4322,BOOK V,Aye murmuring consolations.  But his feet
4323,BOOK V,"Trod for the last time, with reluctant steps,"
4324,BOOK V,That path; and hard behind him followed Doom.
4325,BOOK V,
4326,BOOK V,When to the ships beside the boundless sea
4327,BOOK V,"The Argives, faint for supper and for sleep,"
4328,BOOK V,"Had passed, into the great deep Thetis plunged,"
4329,BOOK V,And all the Nereids with her.  Round them swam
4330,BOOK V,"Sea-monsters many, children of the brine."
4331,BOOK V,
4332,BOOK V,Against the wise Prometheus bitter-wroth
4333,BOOK V,"The Sea-maids were, remembering how that Zeus,"
4334,BOOK V,"Moved by his prophecies, unto Peleus gave"
4335,BOOK V,"Thetis to wife, a most unwilling bride."
4336,BOOK V,Then cried in wrath to these Cymothoe:
4337,BOOK V,"""O that the pestilent prophet had endured"
4338,BOOK V,"All pangs he merited, when, deep-burrowing,"
4339,BOOK V,"The eagle tare his liver aye renewed!"""
4340,BOOK V,
4341,BOOK V,So to the dark-haired Sea-maids cried the Nymph.
4342,BOOK V,Then sank the sun: the onrush of the night
4343,BOOK V,"Shadowed the fields, the heavens were star-bestrewn;"
4344,BOOK V,And by the long-prowed ships the Argives slept
4345,BOOK V,"By ambrosial sleep o'ermastered, and by wine"
4346,BOOK V,The which from proud Idomeneus' realm of Crete:
4347,BOOK V,The shipmen bare o'er foaming leagues of sea.
4348,BOOK V,
4349,BOOK V,"But Aias, wroth against the Argive men,"
4350,BOOK V,"Would none of meat or drink, nor clasped him round"
4351,BOOK V,"The arms of sleep. In fury he donned his mail,"
4352,BOOK V,"He clutched his sword, thinking unspeakable thoughts;"
4353,BOOK V,"For now he thought to set the ships aflame,"
4354,BOOK V,"And slaughter all the Argives, now, to hew"
4355,BOOK V,With sudden onslaught of his terrible sword
4356,BOOK V,Guileful Odysseus limb from limb.  Such things
4357,BOOK V,"He purposed--nay, had soon accomplished all,"
4358,BOOK V,Had Pallas not with madness smitten him;
4359,BOOK V,"For over Odysseus, strong to endure, her heart"
4360,BOOK V,"Yearned, as she called to mind the sacrifices"
4361,BOOK V,Offered to her of him continually.
4362,BOOK V,Therefore she turned aside from Argive men
4363,BOOK V,"The might of Aias.  As a terrible storm,"
4364,BOOK V,"Whose wings are laden with dread hurricane-blasts,"
4365,BOOK V,Cometh with portents of heart-numbing fear
4366,BOOK V,"To shipmen, when the Pleiads, fleeing adread"
4367,BOOK V,"From glorious Orion, plunge beneath"
4368,BOOK V,"The stream of tireless Ocean, when the air"
4369,BOOK V,"Is turmoil, and the sea is mad with storm;"
4370,BOOK V,"So rushed he, whithersoe'er his feet might bear."
4371,BOOK V,"This way and that he ran, like some fierce beast"
4372,BOOK V,Which darteth down a rock-walled glen's ravines
4373,BOOK V,"With foaming jaws, and murderous intent"
4374,BOOK V,"Against the hounds and huntsmen, who have torn"
4375,BOOK V,"Out of the cave her cubs, and slain: she runs"
4376,BOOK V,"This way and that, and roars, if mid the brakes"
4377,BOOK V,Haply she yet may see the dear ones lost;
4378,BOOK V,"Whom if a man meet in that maddened mood,"
4379,BOOK V,Straightway his darkest of all days hath dawned;
4380,BOOK V,So ruthless-raving rushed he; blackly boiled
4381,BOOK V,"His heart, as caldron on the Fire-god's hearth"
4382,BOOK V,Maddens with ceaseless hissing o'er the flames
4383,BOOK V,"From blazing billets coiling round its sides,"
4384,BOOK V,At bidding of the toiler eager-souled
4385,BOOK V,To singe the bristles of a huge-fed boar;
4386,BOOK V,So was his great heart boiling in his breast.
4387,BOOK V,"Like a wild sea he raved, like tempest-blast,"
4388,BOOK V,Like the winged might of tireless flame amidst
4389,BOOK V,"The mountains maddened by a mighty wind,"
4390,BOOK V,When the wide-blazing forest crumbles down
4391,BOOK V,"In fervent heat.  So Aias, his fierce heart"
4392,BOOK V,"With agony stabbed, in maddened misery raved."
4393,BOOK V,Foam frothed about his lips; a beast-like roar
4394,BOOK V,Howled from his throat.  About his shoulders clashed
4395,BOOK V,"His armour.  They which saw him trembled, all"
4396,BOOK V,Cowed by the fearful shout of that one man.
4397,BOOK V,
4398,BOOK V,From Ocean then uprose Dawn golden-reined:
4399,BOOK V,"Like a soft wind upfloated Sleep to heaven,"
4400,BOOK V,"And there met Hera, even then returned"
4401,BOOK V,"To Olympus back from Tethys, unto whom"
4402,BOOK V,"But yester-morn she went.  She clasped him round,"
4403,BOOK V,"And kissed him, who had been her marriage-kin"
4404,BOOK V,Since at her prayer on Ida's erest he had lulled
4405,BOOK V,"To sleep Cronion, when his anger burned"
4406,BOOK V,Against the Argives.  Straightway Hera passed
4407,BOOK V,"To Zeus's mansion, and Sleep swiftly flew"
4408,BOOK V,To Pasithea's couch.  From slumber woke
4409,BOOK V,"All nations of the earth.  But Aias, like"
4410,BOOK V,"Orion the invincible, prowled on,"
4411,BOOK V,Still bearing murderous madness in his heart.
4412,BOOK V,"He rushed upon the sheep, like lion fierce"
4413,BOOK V,Whose savage heart is stung with hunger-pangs.
4414,BOOK V,"Here, there, he smote them, laid them dead in dust"
4415,BOOK V,Thick as the leaves which the strong North-wind's might
4416,BOOK V,"Strews, when the waning year to winter turns;"
4417,BOOK V,"So on the sheep in fury Aias fell,"
4418,BOOK V,Deeming he dealt to Danaans evil doom.
4419,BOOK V,
4420,BOOK V,"Then to his brother Menelaus came,"
4421,BOOK V,"And spake, but not in hearing of the rest:"
4422,BOOK V,"""This day shall surely be a ruinous day"
4423,BOOK V,"For all, since Aias thus is sense-distraught."
4424,BOOK V,"It may be he will set the ships aflame,"
4425,BOOK V,"And slay us all amidst our tents, in wrath"
4426,BOOK V,For those lost arms.  Would God that Thetis ne'er
4427,BOOK V,Had set them for the prize of rivalry!
4428,BOOK V,Would God Laertes' son had not presumed
4429,BOOK V,In folly of soul to strive with a better man!
4430,BOOK V,Fools were we all; and some malignant God
4431,BOOK V,Beguiled us; for the one great war-defence
4432,BOOK V,"Left us, since Aeacus' son in battle fell,"
4433,BOOK V,Was Aias' mighty strength.  And now the Gods
4434,BOOK V,"Will to our loss destroy him, bringing bane"
4435,BOOK V,"On thee and me, that all we may fill up"
4436,BOOK V,"The cup of doom, and pass to nothingness."""
4437,BOOK V,
4438,BOOK V,"He spake; replied Agamemnon, lord of spears:"
4439,BOOK V,"""Now nay, Menelaus, though thine heart he wrung,"
4440,BOOK V,Be thou not wroth with the resourceful king
4441,BOOK V,"Of Cephallenian folk, but with the Gods"
4442,BOOK V,"Who plot our ruin.  Blame not him, who oft"
4443,BOOK V,"Hath been our blessing and our enemies' curse."""
4444,BOOK V,
4445,BOOK V,So heavy-hearted spake the Danaan kings.
4446,BOOK V,But by the streams of Xanthus far away
4447,BOOK V,"'Neath tamarisks shepherds cowered to hide from death,"
4448,BOOK V,As when from a swift eagle cower hares
4449,BOOK V,"'Neath tangled copses, when with sharp fierce scream"
4450,BOOK V,This way and that with wings wide-shadowing
4451,BOOK V,"He wheeleth very nigh; so they here, there,"
4452,BOOK V,Quailed from the presence of that furious man.
4453,BOOK V,"At last above a slaughtered ram he stood,"
4454,BOOK V,And with a deadly laugh he cried to it:
4455,BOOK V,"""Lie there in dust; be meat for dogs and kites!"
4456,BOOK V,"Achilles' glorious arms have saved not thee,"
4457,BOOK V,For which thy folly strove with a better man!
4458,BOOK V,"Lie there, thou cur!  No wife shall fall on thee,"
4459,BOOK V,"And clasp, and wail thee and her fatherless childs,"
4460,BOOK V,"Nor shalt thou greet thy parents' longing eyes,"
4461,BOOK V,The staff of their old age!  Far from thy land
4462,BOOK V,"Thy carrion dogs and vultures shall devour!"""
4463,BOOK V,
4464,BOOK V,"So cried he, thinking that amidst the slain"
4465,BOOK V,Odysseus lay blood-boltered at his feet.
4466,BOOK V,But in that moment from his mind and eyes
4467,BOOK V,Athena tore away the nightmare-fiend
4468,BOOK V,"Of Madness havoc-breathing, and it passed"
4469,BOOK V,Thence swiftly to the rock-walled river Styx
4470,BOOK V,"Where dwell the winged Erinnyes, they which still"
4471,BOOK V,Visit with torments overweening men.
4472,BOOK V,
4473,BOOK V,Then Aias saw those sheep upon the earth
4474,BOOK V,"Gasping in death; and sore amazed he stood,"
4475,BOOK V,For he divined that by the Blessed Ones
4476,BOOK V,His senses had been cheated.  All his limbs
4477,BOOK V,Failed under him; his soul was anguished-thrilled:
4478,BOOK V,He could not in his horror take one step
4479,BOOK V,Forward nor backward.  Like some towering rock
4480,BOOK V,"Fast-rooted mid the mountains, there he stood."
4481,BOOK V,"But when the wild rout of his thoughts had rallied,"
4482,BOOK V,"He groaned in misery, and in anguish wailed:"
4483,BOOK V,"""Ah me! why do the Gods abhor me so?"
4484,BOOK V,"They have wrecked my mind, have with fell madness filled,"
4485,BOOK V,Making me slaughter all these innocent sheep!
4486,BOOK V,Would God that on Odysseus' pestilent heart
4487,BOOK V,"Mine hands had so avenged me!  Miscreant, he"
4488,BOOK V,Brought on me a fell curse!  O may his soul
4489,BOOK V,Suffer all torments that the Avenging Fiends
4490,BOOK V,Devise for villains!  On all other Greeks
4491,BOOK V,"May they bring murderous battle, woeful griefs,"
4492,BOOK V,"And chiefly on Agamemnon, Atreus' son!"
4493,BOOK V,Not scatheless to the home may he return
4494,BOOK V,"So long desired!  But why should I consort,"
4495,BOOK V,"I, a brave man, with the abominable?"
4496,BOOK V,"Perish the Argive host, perish my life,"
4497,BOOK V,Now unendurable!  The brave no more
4498,BOOK V,"Hath his due guerdon, but the baser sort"
4499,BOOK V,"Are honoured most and loved, as this Odysseus"
4500,BOOK V,Hath worship mid the Greeks: but utterly
4501,BOOK V,"Have they forgotten me and all my deeds,"
4502,BOOK V,"All that I wrought and suffered in their cause."""
4503,BOOK V,
4504,BOOK V,"So spake the brave son of strong Telamon,"
4505,BOOK V,Then thrust the sword of Hector through his throat.
4506,BOOK V,Forth rushed the blood in torrent: in the dust
4507,BOOK V,"Outstretched he lay, like Typhon, when the bolts"
4508,BOOK V,Of Zeus had blasted him.  Around him groaned
4509,BOOK V,The dark earth as he fell upon her breast.
4510,BOOK V,
4511,BOOK V,"Then thronging came the Danaans, when they saw"
4512,BOOK V,Low laid in dust the hero; but ere then
4513,BOOK V,"None dared draw nigh him, but in deadly fear"
4514,BOOK V,They watched him from afar.  Now hasted they
4515,BOOK V,"And flung themselves upon the dead, outstretched"
4516,BOOK V,Upon their faces: on their heads they cast
4517,BOOK V,"Dust, and their wailing went up to the sky."
4518,BOOK V,As when men drive away the tender lambs
4519,BOOK V,"Out of the fleecy flock, to feast thereon,"
4520,BOOK V,And round the desolate pens the mothers leap
4521,BOOK V,"Ceaselessly bleating, so o'er Aias rang"
4522,BOOK V,That day a very great and bitter cry.
4523,BOOK V,"Wild echoes pealed from Ida forest-palled,"
4524,BOOK V,"And from the plain, the ships, the boundless sea."
4525,BOOK V,
4526,BOOK V,Then Teucer clasping him was minded too
4527,BOOK V,To rush on bitter doom: howbeit the rest
4528,BOOK V,Held from the sword his hand.  Anguished he fell
4529,BOOK V,"Upon the dead, outpouring many a tear"
4530,BOOK V,More comfortlessly than the orphan babe
4531,BOOK V,"That wails beside the hearth, with ashes strewn"
4532,BOOK V,"On head and shoulders, wails bereavement's day"
4533,BOOK V,That brings death to the mother who hath nursed
4534,BOOK V,"The fatherless child; so wailed he, ever wailed"
4535,BOOK V,"His great death-stricken brother, creeping slow"
4536,BOOK V,"Around the corpse, and uttering his lament:"
4537,BOOK V,"""O Aias, mighty-souled, why was thine heart"
4538,BOOK V,"Distraught, that thou shouldst deal unto thyself"
4539,BOOK V,"Murder and bale?  All, was it that the sons"
4540,BOOK V,"Of Troy might win a breathing-space from woes,"
4541,BOOK V,"Might come and slay the Greeks, now thou art not?"
4542,BOOK V,From these shall all the olden courage fail
4543,BOOK V,When fast they fall in fight.  Their shield from harm
4544,BOOK V,"Is broken now!  For me, I have no will"
4545,BOOK V,"To see mine home again, now thou art dead."
4546,BOOK V,"Nay, but I long here also now to die,"
4547,BOOK V,That so the earth may shroud me--me and thee
4548,BOOK V,"Not for my parents so much do I care,"
4549,BOOK V,"If haply yet they live, if haply yet"
4550,BOOK V,"Spared from the grave, in Salamis they dwell,"
4551,BOOK V,"As for thee, O my glory and my crown!"""
4552,BOOK V,
4553,BOOK V,So cried he groaning sore; with answering moan
4554,BOOK V,"Queenly Tecmessa wailed, the princess-bride"
4555,BOOK V,"Of noble Aias, captive of his spear,"
4556,BOOK V,"Yet ta'en by him to wife, and household-queen"
4557,BOOK V,"O'er all his substance, even all that wives"
4558,BOOK V,Won with a bride-price rule for wedded lords.
4559,BOOK V,"Clasped in his mighty arms, she bare to him"
4560,BOOK V,"A son Eurysaces, in all things like"
4561,BOOK V,"Unto his father, far as babe might be"
4562,BOOK V,Yet cradled in his tent.  With bitter moan
4563,BOOK V,"Fell she on that dear corpse, all her fair form"
4564,BOOK V,"Close-shrouded in her veil, and dust-defiled,"
4565,BOOK V,And from her anguished heart cried piteously:
4566,BOOK V,"""Alas for me, for me now thou art dead,"
4567,BOOK V,"Not by the hands of foes in fight struck down,"
4568,BOOK V,But by thine own!  On me is come a grief
4569,BOOK V,Ever-abiding!  Never had I looked
4570,BOOK V,To see thy woeful death-day here by Troy.
4571,BOOK V,"Ah, visions shattered by rude hands of Fate!"
4572,BOOK V,Oh that the earth had yawned wide for my grave
4573,BOOK V,Ere I beheld thy bitter doom!  On me
4574,BOOK V,"No sharper, more heart-piercing pang hath come--"
4575,BOOK V,"No, not when first from fatherland afar"
4576,BOOK V,"And parents thou didst bear me, wailing sore"
4577,BOOK V,"Mid other captives, when the day of bondage"
4578,BOOK V,"Had come on me, a princess theretofore."
4579,BOOK V,"Not for that dear lost home so much I grieve,"
4580,BOOK V,"Nor for my parents dead, as now for thee:"
4581,BOOK V,For all thine heart was kindness unto me
4582,BOOK V,"The hapless, and thou madest me thy wife,"
4583,BOOK V,"One soul with thee; yea, and thou promisedst"
4584,BOOK V,"To throne me queen of fair-towered Salamis,"
4585,BOOK V,When home we won from Troy.  The Gods denied
4586,BOOK V,Accomplishment thereof.  And thou hast passed
4587,BOOK V,Unto the Unseen Land: thou hast forgot
4588,BOOK V,"Me and thy child, who never shall make glad"
4589,BOOK V,"His father's heart, shall never mount thy throne."
4590,BOOK V,But him shall strangers make a wretched thrall:
4591,BOOK V,"For when the father is no more, the babe"
4592,BOOK V,Is ward of meaner men.  A weary life
4593,BOOK V,"The orphan knows, and suffering cometh in"
4594,BOOK V,From every side upon him like a flood.
4595,BOOK V,"To me too thraldom's day shall doubtless come,"
4596,BOOK V,"Now thou hast died, who wast my god on earth."""
4597,BOOK V,
4598,BOOK V,Then in all kindness Agamemnon spake:
4599,BOOK V,"""Princess, no man on earth shall make thee thrall,"
4600,BOOK V,"While Teucer liveth yet, while yet I live."
4601,BOOK V,Thou shalt have worship of us evermore
4602,BOOK V,"And honour as a Goddess, with thy son,"
4603,BOOK V,"As though yet living were that godlike man,"
4604,BOOK V,"Aias, who was the Achaeans' chiefest strength."
4605,BOOK V,Ah that he had not laid this load of grief
4606,BOOK V,"On all, in dying by his own right hand!"
4607,BOOK V,For all the countless armies of his foes
4608,BOOK V,"Never availed to slay him in fair fight."""
4609,BOOK V,
4610,BOOK V,"So spake he, grieved to the inmost heart.  The folk"
4611,BOOK V,Woefully wafted all round.  O'er Hellespont
4612,BOOK V,Echoes of mourning rolled: the sighing air
4613,BOOK V,"Darkened around, a wide-spread sorrow-pall."
4614,BOOK V,"Yea, grief laid hold on wise Odysseus' self"
4615,BOOK V,"For the great dead, and with remorseful soul"
4616,BOOK V,To anguish-stricken Argives thus he spake:
4617,BOOK V,"""O friends, there is no greater curse to men"
4618,BOOK V,"Than wrath, which groweth till its bitter fruit"
4619,BOOK V,Is strife.  Now wrath hath goaded Aias on
4620,BOOK V,To this dire issue of the rage that filled
4621,BOOK V,His soul against me.  Would to God that ne'er
4622,BOOK V,Yon Trojans in the strife for Achilles' arms
4623,BOOK V,"Had crowned me with that victory, for which"
4624,BOOK V,"Strong Telamon's brave son, in agony"
4625,BOOK V,"Of soul, thus perished by his own right hand!"
4626,BOOK V,"Yet blame not me, I pray you, for his wrath:"
4627,BOOK V,Blame the dark dolorous Fate that struck him down.
4628,BOOK V,"For, had mine heart foreboded aught of this,"
4629,BOOK V,"This desperation of a soul distraught,"
4630,BOOK V,"Never for victory had I striven with him,"
4631,BOOK V,"Nor had I suffered any Danaan else,"
4632,BOOK V,"Though ne'er so eager, to contend with him."
4633,BOOK V,"Nay, I had taken up those arms divine"
4634,BOOK V,"With mine own hands, and gladly given them"
4635,BOOK V,"To him, ay, though himself desired it not."
4636,BOOK V,But for such mighty grief and wrath in him
4637,BOOK V,"I had not looked, since not for a woman's sake"
4638,BOOK V,"Nor for a city, nor possessions wide,"
4639,BOOK V,"I then contended, but for Honour's meed,"
4640,BOOK V,Which alway is for all right-hearted men
4641,BOOK V,The happy goal of all their rivalry.
4642,BOOK V,But that great-hearted man was led astray
4643,BOOK V,"By Fate, the hateful fiend; for surely it is"
4644,BOOK V,Unworthy a man to be made passion's fool.
4645,BOOK V,"The wise man's part is, steadfast-souled to endure"
4646,BOOK V,"All ills, and not to rage against his lot."""
4647,BOOK V,
4648,BOOK V,"So spake Laertes' son, the far-renowned."
4649,BOOK V,"But when they all were weary of grief and groan,"
4650,BOOK V,Then to those sorrowing ones spake Neleus' son:
4651,BOOK V,"""O friends, the pitiless-hearted Fates have laid"
4652,BOOK V,"Stroke after stroke of sorrow upon us,"
4653,BOOK V,"Sorrow for Aias dead, for mighty Achilles,"
4654,BOOK V,"For many an Argive, and for mine own son"
4655,BOOK V,Antilochus.  Yet all unmeet it is
4656,BOOK V,Day after day with passion of grief to wail
4657,BOOK V,"Men slain in battle: nay, we must forget"
4658,BOOK V,"Laments, and turn us to the better task"
4659,BOOK V,"Of rendering dues beseeming to the dead,"
4660,BOOK V,"The dues of pyre, of tomb, of bones inurned."
4661,BOOK V,No lamentations will awake the dead;
4662,BOOK V,"No note thereof he taketh, when the Fates,"
4663,BOOK V,"The ruthless ones, have swallowed him in night."""
4664,BOOK V,
4665,BOOK V,So spake he words of cheer: the godlike kings
4666,BOOK V,"Gathered with heavy hearts around the dead,"
4667,BOOK V,"And many hands upheaved the giant corpse,"
4668,BOOK V,"And swiftly bare him to the ships, and there"
4669,BOOK V,Washed they away the blood that clotted lay
4670,BOOK V,Dust-flecked on mighty limbs and armour: then
4671,BOOK V,In linen swathed him round.  From Ida's heights
4672,BOOK V,"Wood without measure did the young men bring,"
4673,BOOK V,And piled it round the corpse.  Billets and logs
4674,BOOK V,Yet more in a wide circle heaped they round;
4675,BOOK V,"And sheep they laid thereon, fair-woven vests,"
4676,BOOK V,"And goodly kine, and speed-triumphant steeds,"
4677,BOOK V,"And gleaming gold, and armour without stint,"
4678,BOOK V,From slain foes by that glorious hero stripped.
4679,BOOK V,"And lucent amber-drops they laid thereon,"
4680,BOOK V,"Years, say they, which the Daughters of the Sun,"
4681,BOOK V,"The Lord of Omens, shed for Phaethon slain,"
4682,BOOK V,When by Eridanus' flood they mourned for him.
4683,BOOK V,"These, for undying honour to his son,"
4684,BOOK V,"The God made amber, precious in men's eyes."
4685,BOOK V,Even this the Argives on that broad-based pyre
4686,BOOK V,"Cast freely, honouring the mighty dead."
4687,BOOK V,"And round him, groaning heavily, they laid"
4688,BOOK V,"Silver most fair and precious ivory,"
4689,BOOK V,"And jars of oil, and whatsoe'er beside"
4690,BOOK V,They have who heap up goodly and glorious wealth.
4691,BOOK V,"Then thrust they in the strength of ravening flame,"
4692,BOOK V,"And from the sea there breathed a wind, sent forth"
4693,BOOK V,"By Thetis, to consume the giant frame"
4694,BOOK V,Of Aias.  All the night and all the morn
4695,BOOK V,Burned 'neath the urgent stress of that great wind
4696,BOOK V,"Beside the ships that giant form, as when"
4697,BOOK V,Enceladus by Zeus' levin was consumed
4698,BOOK V,"Beneath Thrinacia, when from all the isle"
4699,BOOK V,Smoke of his burning rose--or like as when
4700,BOOK V,"Hercules, trapped by Nessus' deadly guile,"
4701,BOOK V,"Gave to devouring fire his living limbs,"
4702,BOOK V,"What time he dared that awful deed, when groaned"
4703,BOOK V,"All Oeta as he burned alive, and passed"
4704,BOOK V,"His soul into the air, leaving the man"
4705,BOOK V,"Far-famous, to be numbered with the Gods,"
4706,BOOK V,When earth closed o'er his toil-tried mortal part.
4707,BOOK V,"So huge amid the flames, all-armour clad,"
4708,BOOK V,"Lay Aias, all the joy of fight forgot,"
4709,BOOK V,While a great multitude watching thronged the sands.
4710,BOOK V,"Glad were the Trojans, but the Achaeans grieved."
4711,BOOK V,
4712,BOOK V,But when that goodly frame by ravening fire
4713,BOOK V,"Was all consumed, they quenched the pyre with wine;"
4714,BOOK V,"They gathered up the bones, and reverently"
4715,BOOK V,Laid in a golden casket.  Hard beside
4716,BOOK V,Rhoeteium's headland heaped they up a mound
4717,BOOK V,Measureless-high.  Then scattered they amidst
4718,BOOK V,"The long ships, heavy-hearted for the man"
4719,BOOK V,Whom they had honoured even as Achilles.
4720,BOOK V,"Then black night, bearing unto all men sleep,"
4721,BOOK V,"Upfloated: so they brake bread, and lay down"
4722,BOOK V,"Waiting the Child of the Mist.  Short was sleep,"
4723,BOOK V,"Broken by fitful staring through the dark,"
4724,BOOK V,Haunted by dread lest in the night the foe
4725,BOOK V,"Should fall on them, now Telamon's son was dead."
4726,BOOK V,
4727,BOOK V,
4728,BOOK V,
4729,BOOK VI,BOOK VI
4730,BOOK VI,
4731,BOOK VI,"How came for the helping of Troy Eurypylus, Hercules' grandson."
4732,BOOK VI,
4733,BOOK VI,
4734,BOOK VI,"Rose Dawn from Ocean and Tithonus' bed,"
4735,BOOK VI,"And climbed the steeps of heaven, scattering round"
4736,BOOK VI,Flushed flakes of splendour; laughed all earth and air.
4737,BOOK VI,"Then turned unto their labours, each to each,"
4738,BOOK VI,"Mortals, frail creatures daily dying.  Then"
4739,BOOK VI,Streamed to a folkmote all the Achaean men
4740,BOOK VI,At Menelaus' summons.  When the host
4741,BOOK VI,"Were gathered all, then in their midst he spake:"
4742,BOOK VI,"""Hearken my words, ye god-descended kings:"
4743,BOOK VI,Mine heart within my breast is burdened sore
4744,BOOK VI,"For men which perish, men that for my sake"
4745,BOOK VI,"Came to the bitter war, whose home-return"
4746,BOOK VI,Parents and home shall welcome nevermore;
4747,BOOK VI,For Fate hath cut off thousands in their prime.
4748,BOOK VI,Oh that the heavy hand of death had fallen
4749,BOOK VI,"On me, ere hitherward I gathered these!"
4750,BOOK VI,But now hath God laid on me cureless pain
4751,BOOK VI,In seeing all these ills.  Who could rejoice
4752,BOOK VI,"Beholding strivings, struggles of despair?"
4753,BOOK VI,"Come, let us, which be yet alive, in haste"
4754,BOOK VI,"Flee in the ships, each to his several land,"
4755,BOOK VI,Since Aias and Achilles both are dead.
4756,BOOK VI,"I look not, now they are slain, that we the rest"
4757,BOOK VI,"Shall 'scape destruction; nay, but we shall fall"
4758,BOOK VI,Before yon terrible Trojans for my sake
4759,BOOK VI,And shameless Helen's!  Think not that I care
4760,BOOK VI,"For her: for you I care, when I behold"
4761,BOOK VI,Good men in battle slain.  Away with her--
4762,BOOK VI,Her and her paltry paramour!  The Gods
4763,BOOK VI,Stole all discretion out of her false heart
4764,BOOK VI,When she forsook mine home and marriage-bed.
4765,BOOK VI,Let Priam and the Trojans cherish her!
4766,BOOK VI,But let us straight return: 'twere better far
4767,BOOK VI,"To flee from dolorous war than perish all."""
4768,BOOK VI,
4769,BOOK VI,So spake he but to try the Argive men.
4770,BOOK VI,Far other thoughts than these made his heart burn
4771,BOOK VI,"With passionate desire to slay his foes,"
4772,BOOK VI,To break the long walls of their city down
4773,BOOK VI,"From their foundations, and to glut with blood"
4774,BOOK VI,"Ares, when Paris mid the slain should fall."
4775,BOOK VI,Fiercer is naught than passionate desire!
4776,BOOK VI,"Thus as he pondered, sitting in his place,"
4777,BOOK VI,"Uprose Tydeides, shaker of the shield,"
4778,BOOK VI,And chode in fiery speech with Menelaus:
4779,BOOK VI,"""O coward Atreus' son, what craven fear"
4780,BOOK VI,"Hath gripped thee, that thou speakest so to us"
4781,BOOK VI,As might a weakling child or woman speak?
4782,BOOK VI,Not unto thee Achaea's noblest sons
4783,BOOK VI,"Will hearken, ere Troy's coronal of towers"
4784,BOOK VI,Be wholly dashed to the dust: for unto men
4785,BOOK VI,"Valour is high renown, and flight is shame!"
4786,BOOK VI,If any man shall hearken to the words
4787,BOOK VI,"Of this thy counsel, I will smite from him"
4788,BOOK VI,"His head with sharp blue steel, and hurl it down"
4789,BOOK VI,For soaring kites to feast on.  Up!  all ye
4790,BOOK VI,Who care to enkindle men to battle: rouse
4791,BOOK VI,Our warriors all throughout the fleet to whet
4792,BOOK VI,"The spear, to burnish corslet, helm and shield;"
4793,BOOK VI,"And cause both man and horse, all which be keen"
4794,BOOK VI,"In fight, to break their fast.  Then in yon plain"
4795,BOOK VI,"Who is the stronger Ares shall decide."""
4796,BOOK VI,
4797,BOOK VI,"So speaking, in his place he sat him down;"
4798,BOOK VI,"Then rose up Thestor's son, and in the midst,"
4799,BOOK VI,"Where meet it is to speak, stood forth and cried:"
4800,BOOK VI,"""Hear me, ye sons of battle-biding Greeks:"
4801,BOOK VI,Ye know I have the spirit of prophecy.
4802,BOOK VI,Erewhile I said that ye in the tenth year
4803,BOOK VI,Should lay waste towered Ilium: this the Gods
4804,BOOK VI,Are even now fulfilling; victory lies
4805,BOOK VI,"At the Argives' very feet.  Come, let us send"
4806,BOOK VI,Tydeides and Odysseus battle-staunch
4807,BOOK VI,"With speed to Scyros overseas, by prayers"
4808,BOOK VI,Hither to bring Achilles' hero son:
4809,BOOK VI,"A light of victory shall he be to us."""
4810,BOOK VI,
4811,BOOK VI,"So spake wise Thestius' son, and all the folk"
4812,BOOK VI,Shouted for joy; for all their hearts and hopes
4813,BOOK VI,Yearned to see Calchas' prophecy fulfilled.
4814,BOOK VI,Then to the Argives spake Laertes' son:
4815,BOOK VI,"""Friends, it befits not to say many words"
4816,BOOK VI,"This day to you, in sorrow's weariness."
4817,BOOK VI,I know that wearied men can find no joy
4818,BOOK VI,"In speech or song, though the Pierides,"
4819,BOOK VI,"The immortal Muses, love it.  At such time"
4820,BOOK VI,"Few words do men desire.  But now, this thing"
4821,BOOK VI,"That pleaseth all the Achaean host, will I"
4822,BOOK VI,"Accomplish, so Tydeides fare with me;"
4823,BOOK VI,"For, if we twain go, we shall surely bring,"
4824,BOOK VI,"Won by our words, war-fain Achilles' son,"
4825,BOOK VI,"Yea, though his mother, weeping sore, should strive"
4826,BOOK VI,Within her halls to keep him; for mine heart
4827,BOOK VI,"Trusts that he is a hero's valorous son."""
4828,BOOK VI,
4829,BOOK VI,Then out spake Menelaus earnestly:
4830,BOOK VI,"""Odysseus, the strong Argives' help at need,"
4831,BOOK VI,If mighty-souled Achilles' valiant son
4832,BOOK VI,From Scyros by thy suasion come to aid
4833,BOOK VI,"Us who yearn for him, and some Heavenly One"
4834,BOOK VI,"Grant victory to our prayers, and I win home"
4835,BOOK VI,"To Hellas, I will give to him to wife"
4836,BOOK VI,"My noble child Hermione, with gifts"
4837,BOOK VI,Many and goodly for her marriage-dower
4838,BOOK VI,With a glad heart.  I trow he shall not scorn
4839,BOOK VI,"Either his bride or high-born sire-in-law."""
4840,BOOK VI,
4841,BOOK VI,With a great shout the Danaans hailed his words.
4842,BOOK VI,"Then was the throng dispersed, and to the ships"
4843,BOOK VI,They scattered hungering for the morning meat
4844,BOOK VI,Which strengtheneth man's heart.  So when they ceased
4845,BOOK VI,"From eating, and desire was satisfied,"
4846,BOOK VI,Then with the wise Odysseus Tydeus' son
4847,BOOK VI,"Drew down a swift ship to the boundless sea,"
4848,BOOK VI,And victual and all tackling cast therein.
4849,BOOK VI,"Then stepped they aboard, and with them twenty men,"
4850,BOOK VI,"Men skilled to row when winds were contrary,"
4851,BOOK VI,Or when the unrippled sea slept 'neath a calm.
4852,BOOK VI,"They smote the brine, and flashed the boiling foam:"
4853,BOOK VI,On leapt the ship; a watery way was cleft
4854,BOOK VI,About the oars that sweating rowers tugged.
4855,BOOK VI,"As when hard-toiling oxen, 'neath the yoke"
4856,BOOK VI,"Straining, drag on a massy-timbered wain,"
4857,BOOK VI,"While creaks the circling axle 'neath its load,"
4858,BOOK VI,And from their weary necks and shoulders streams
4859,BOOK VI,Down to the ground the sweat abundantly;
4860,BOOK VI,"So at the stiff oars toiled those stalwart men,"
4861,BOOK VI,And fast they laid behind them leagues of sea.
4862,BOOK VI,"Gazed after them the Achaeans as they went,"
4863,BOOK VI,"Then turned to whet their deadly darts and spears,"
4864,BOOK VI,The weapons of their warfare.  In their town
4865,BOOK VI,The aweless Trojans armed themselves the while
4866,BOOK VI,"War-eager, praying to the Gods to grant"
4867,BOOK VI,"Respite from slaughter, breathing-space from toil."
4868,BOOK VI,
4869,BOOK VI,"To these, while sorely thus they yearned, the Gods"
4870,BOOK VI,"Brought present help in trouble, even the seed"
4871,BOOK VI,"Of mighty Hercules, Eurypylus."
4872,BOOK VI,"A great host followed him, in battle skilled,"
4873,BOOK VI,"All that by long Caicus' outflow dwelt,"
4874,BOOK VI,Full of triumphant trust in their strong spears.
4875,BOOK VI,Round them rejoicing thronged the sons of Troy:
4876,BOOK VI,As when tame geese within a pen gaze up
4877,BOOK VI,"On him who casts them corn, and round his feet"
4878,BOOK VI,"Throng hissing uncouth love, and his heart warms"
4879,BOOK VI,As he looks down on them; so thronged the sons
4880,BOOK VI,"Of Troy, as on fierce-heart Eurypylus"
4881,BOOK VI,They gazed; and gladdened was his aweless soul
4882,BOOK VI,To see those throngs: from porchways women looked
4883,BOOK VI,Wide-eyed with wonder on the godlike man.
4884,BOOK VI,"Above all men he towered as on he strode,"
4885,BOOK VI,As looks a lion when amid the hills
4886,BOOK VI,"He comes on jackals.  Paris welcomed him,"
4887,BOOK VI,"As Hector honouring him, his cousin he,"
4888,BOOK VI,"Being of one blood with him, who was born Of"
4889,BOOK VI,"Astyoche, King Priam's sister fair"
4890,BOOK VI,"Whom Telephus embraced in his strong arms,"
4891,BOOK VI,"Telephus, whom to aweless Hercules"
4892,BOOK VI,Auge the bright-haired bare in secret love.
4893,BOOK VI,"That babe, a suckling craving for the breast,"
4894,BOOK VI,"A swift hind fostered, giving him the teat"
4895,BOOK VI,As to her own fawn in all love; for Zeus
4896,BOOK VI,"So willed it, in whose eyes it was not meet"
4897,BOOK VI,That Hercules' child should perish wretchedly.
4898,BOOK VI,His glorious son with glad heart Paris led
4899,BOOK VI,Unto his palace through the wide-wayed burg
4900,BOOK VI,Beside Assaracus' tomb and stately halls
4901,BOOK VI,"Of Hector, and Tritonis' holy fane."
4902,BOOK VI,"Hard by his mansion stood, and therebeside"
4903,BOOK VI,The stainless altar of Home-warder Zeus
4904,BOOK VI,"Rose.  As they went, he lovingly questioned him"
4905,BOOK VI,"Of brethren, parents, and of marriage-kin;"
4906,BOOK VI,And all he craved to know Eurypylus told.
4907,BOOK VI,"So communed they, on-pacing side by side."
4908,BOOK VI,Then came they to a palace great and rich:
4909,BOOK VI,"There goddess-like sat Helen, clothed upon"
4910,BOOK VI,With beauty of the Graces.  Maidens four
4911,BOOK VI,About her plied their tasks: others apart
4912,BOOK VI,Within that goodly bower wrought the works
4913,BOOK VI,Beseeming handmaids.  Helen marvelling gazed
4914,BOOK VI,"Upon Eurypylus, on Helen he."
4915,BOOK VI,Then these in converse each with other spake
4916,BOOK VI,In that all-odorous bower.  The handmaids brought
4917,BOOK VI,And set beside their lady high-seats twain;
4918,BOOK VI,"And Paris sat him down, and at his side"
4919,BOOK VI,Eurypylus.  That hero's host encamped
4920,BOOK VI,"Without the city, where the Trojan guards"
4921,BOOK VI,Kept watch.  Their armour laid they on the earth;
4922,BOOK VI,"Their steeds, yet breathing battle, stood thereby,"
4923,BOOK VI,And cribs were heaped with horses' provender.
4924,BOOK VI,
4925,BOOK VI,"Upfloated night, and darkened earth and air;"
4926,BOOK VI,"Then feasted they before that cliff-like wall,"
4927,BOOK VI,Ceteian men and Trojans: babel of talk
4928,BOOK VI,Rose from the feasters: all around the glow
4929,BOOK VI,Of blazing campfires lighted up the tents:
4930,BOOK VI,"Pealed out the pipe's sweet voice, and hautboys rang"
4931,BOOK VI,With their clear-shrilling reeds; the witching strain
4932,BOOK VI,Of lyres was rippling round.  From far away
4933,BOOK VI,"The Argives gazed and marvelled, seeing the plain"
4934,BOOK VI,"Aglare with many fires, and hearing notes"
4935,BOOK VI,"Of flutes and lyres, neighing of chariot-steeds"
4936,BOOK VI,"And pipes, the shepherd's and the banquet's joy."
4937,BOOK VI,Therefore they bade their fellows each in turn
4938,BOOK VI,"Keep watch and ward about the tents till dawn,"
4939,BOOK VI,Lest those proud Trojans feasting by their walls
4940,BOOK VI,"Should fall on them, and set the ships aflame."
4941,BOOK VI,
4942,BOOK VI,Within the halls of Paris all this while
4943,BOOK VI,With kings and princes Telephus' hero son
4944,BOOK VI,Feasted; and Priam and the sons of Troy
4945,BOOK VI,Each after each prayed him to play the man
4946,BOOK VI,"Against the Argives, and in bitter doom"
4947,BOOK VI,To lay them low; and blithe he promised all.
4948,BOOK VI,"So when they had supped, each hied him to his home;"
4949,BOOK VI,But there Eurypylus laid him down to rest
4950,BOOK VI,"Full nigh the feast-hall, in the stately bower"
4951,BOOK VI,Where Paris theretofore himself had slept
4952,BOOK VI,With Helen world-renowned.  A bower it was
4953,BOOK VI,"Most wondrous fair, the goodliest of them all."
4954,BOOK VI,There lay he down; but otherwhere their rest
4955,BOOK VI,"Took they, till rose the bright-throned Queen of Morn."
4956,BOOK VI,"Up sprang with dawn the son of Telephus,"
4957,BOOK VI,And passed to the host with all those other kings
4958,BOOK VI,In Troy abiding.  Straightway did the folk
4959,BOOK VI,"All battle-eager don their warrior-gear,"
4960,BOOK VI,Burning to strike in forefront of the fight.
4961,BOOK VI,And now Eurypylus clad his mighty limbs
4962,BOOK VI,In armour that like levin-flashes gleamed;
4963,BOOK VI,Upon his shield by cunning hands were wrought
4964,BOOK VI,All the great labours of strong Hercules.
4965,BOOK VI,
4966,BOOK VI,Thereon were seen two serpents flickering
4967,BOOK VI,Black tongues from grimly jaws: they seemed in act
4968,BOOK VI,To dart; but Hercules' hands to right and left--
4969,BOOK VI,Albeit a babe's hands--now were throttling them;
4970,BOOK VI,For aweless was his spirit.  As Zeus' strength
4971,BOOK VI,From the beginning was his strength.  The seed
4972,BOOK VI,Of Heaven-abiders never deedless is
4973,BOOK VI,"Nor helpless, but hath boundless prowess, yea,"
4974,BOOK VI,Even when in the womb unborn it lies.
4975,BOOK VI,
4976,BOOK VI,Nemea's mighty lion there was seen
4977,BOOK VI,"Strangled in the strong arms of Hercules,"
4978,BOOK VI,His grim jaws dashed about with bloody foam:
4979,BOOK VI,He seemed in verity gasping out his life.
4980,BOOK VI,
4981,BOOK VI,Thereby was wrought the Hydra many-necked
4982,BOOK VI,Flickering its dread tongues.  Of its fearful heads
4983,BOOK VI,"Some severed lay on earth, but many more"
4984,BOOK VI,"Were budding from its necks, while Hercules"
4985,BOOK VI,"And Iolaus, dauntless-hearted twain,"
4986,BOOK VI,Toiled hard; the one with lightning sickle-sweeps
4987,BOOK VI,"Lopped the fierce heads, his fellow seared each neck"
4988,BOOK VI,With glowing iron; the monster so was slain.
4989,BOOK VI,
4990,BOOK VI,Thereby was wrought the mighty tameless Boar
4991,BOOK VI,"With foaming jaws; real seemed the pictured thing,"
4992,BOOK VI,As by Aleides' giant strength the brute
4993,BOOK VI,Was to Eurystheus living borne on high.
4994,BOOK VI,
4995,BOOK VI,There fashioned was the fleetfoot stag which laid
4996,BOOK VI,The vineyards waste of hapless husbandmen.
4997,BOOK VI,"The Hero's hands held fast its golden horns,"
4998,BOOK VI,The while it snorted breath of ravening fire.
4999,BOOK VI,
5000,BOOK VI,"Thereon were seen the fierce Stymphalian Birds,"
5001,BOOK VI,"Some arrow-smitten dying in the dust,"
5002,BOOK VI,Some through the grey air darting in swift flight.
5003,BOOK VI,"At this, at that one--hot in haste he seemed--"
5004,BOOK VI,Hercules sped the arrows of his wrath.
5005,BOOK VI,
5006,BOOK VI,Augeias' monstrous stable there was wrought
5007,BOOK VI,With cunning craft on that invincible targe;
5008,BOOK VI,And Hercules was turning through the same
5009,BOOK VI,"The deep flow of Alpheius' stream divine,"
5010,BOOK VI,While wondering Nymphs looked down on every hand
5011,BOOK VI,Upon that mighty work.  Elsewhere portrayed
5012,BOOK VI,Was the Fire-breathing Bull: the Hero's grip
5013,BOOK VI,On his strong horns wrenched round the massive neck:
5014,BOOK VI,The straining muscles on his arm stood out:
5015,BOOK VI,The huge beast seemed to bellow.  Next thereto
5016,BOOK VI,Wrought on the shield was one in beauty arrayed
5017,BOOK VI,"As of a Goddess, even Hippolyta."
5018,BOOK VI,The hero by the hair was dragging her
5019,BOOK VI,"From her swift steed, with fierce resolve to wrest"
5020,BOOK VI,With his strong hands the Girdle Marvellous
5021,BOOK VI,"From the Amazon Queen, while quailing shrank away"
5022,BOOK VI,The Maids of War.  There in the Thracian land
5023,BOOK VI,Were Diomedes' grim man-eating steeds:
5024,BOOK VI,"These at their gruesome mangers had he slain,"
5025,BOOK VI,And dead they lay with their fiend-hearted lord.
5026,BOOK VI,
5027,BOOK VI,There lay the bulk of giant Geryon
5028,BOOK VI,Dead mid his kine.  His gory heads were cast
5029,BOOK VI,"In dust, dashed down by that resistless club."
5030,BOOK VI,Before him slain lay that most murderous hound
5031,BOOK VI,"Orthros, in furious might like Cerberus"
5032,BOOK VI,"His brother-hound: a herdman lay thereby,"
5033,BOOK VI,"Eurytion, all bedabbled with his blood."
5034,BOOK VI,
5035,BOOK VI,"There were the Golden Apples wrought, that gleamed"
5036,BOOK VI,In the Hesperides' garden undefiled:
5037,BOOK VI,"All round the fearful Serpent's dead coils lay,"
5038,BOOK VI,And shrank the Maids aghast from Zeus' bold son.
5039,BOOK VI,
5040,BOOK VI,"And there, a dread sight even for Gods to see,"
5041,BOOK VI,"Was Cerberus, whom the Loathly Worm had borne"
5042,BOOK VI,To Typho in a craggy cavern's gloom
5043,BOOK VI,"Close on the borders of Eternal Night,"
5044,BOOK VI,"A hideous monster, warder of the Gate"
5045,BOOK VI,"Of Hades, Home of Wailing, jailer-hound"
5046,BOOK VI,Of dead folk in the shadowy Gulf of Doom.
5047,BOOK VI,But lightly Zeus' son with his crashing blows
5048,BOOK VI,"Tamed him, and haled him from the cataract flood"
5049,BOOK VI,"Of Styx, with heavy-drooping head, and dragged"
5050,BOOK VI,The Dog sore loth to the strange upper air
5051,BOOK VI,"All dauntlessly.  And there, at the world's end,"
5052,BOOK VI,"Were Caucasus' long glens, where Hercules,"
5053,BOOK VI,"Rending Prometheus' chains, and hurling them"
5054,BOOK VI,This way and that with fragments of the rock
5055,BOOK VI,"Whereinto they were riveted, set free"
5056,BOOK VI,The mighty Titan.  Arrow-smitten lay
5057,BOOK VI,The Eagle of the Torment therebeside.
5058,BOOK VI,
5059,BOOK VI,There stormed the wild rout of the Centaurs round
5060,BOOK VI,The hall of Pholus: goaded on by Strife
5061,BOOK VI,"And wine, with Hercules the monsters fought."
5062,BOOK VI,Amidst the pine-trunks stricken to death they lay
5063,BOOK VI,"Still grasping those strange weapons in dead hands,"
5064,BOOK VI,While some with stems long-shafted still fought on
5065,BOOK VI,"In fury, and refrained not from the strife;"
5066,BOOK VI,"And all their heads, gashed in the pitiless fight,"
5067,BOOK VI,Were drenched with gore--the whole scene seemed to live--
5068,BOOK VI,With blood the wine was mingled: meats and bowls
5069,BOOK VI,And tables in one ruin shattered lay.
5070,BOOK VI,
5071,BOOK VI,"There by Evenus' torrent, in fierce wrath"
5072,BOOK VI,"For his sweet bride, he laid with the arrow low"
5073,BOOK VI,Nessus in mid-flight.  There withal was wrought
5074,BOOK VI,"Antaeus' brawny strength, who challenged him"
5075,BOOK VI,To wrestling-strife; he in those sinewy arms
5076,BOOK VI,"Raised high above the earth, was crushed to death."
5077,BOOK VI,
5078,BOOK VI,"There where swift Hellespont meets the outer sea,"
5079,BOOK VI,"Lay the sea-monster slain by his ruthless shafts,"
5080,BOOK VI,While from Hesione he rent her chains.
5081,BOOK VI,
5082,BOOK VI,Of bold Alcides many a deed beside
5083,BOOK VI,Shone on the broad shield of Eurypylus.
5084,BOOK VI,"He seemed the War-god, as from rank to rank"
5085,BOOK VI,"He sped; rejoiced the Trojans following him,"
5086,BOOK VI,"Seeing his arms, and him clothed with the might"
5087,BOOK VI,Of Gods; and Paris hailed him to the fray:
5088,BOOK VI,"""Glad am I for thy coming, for mine heart"
5089,BOOK VI,Trusts that the Argives all shall wretchedly
5090,BOOK VI,Be with their ships destroyed; for such a man
5091,BOOK VI,Mid Greeks or Trojans never have I seen.
5092,BOOK VI,"Now, by the strength and fury of Hercules--"
5093,BOOK VI,"To whom in stature, might, and goodlihead"
5094,BOOK VI,"Most like thou art I pray thee, have in mind"
5095,BOOK VI,"Him, and resolve to match his deeds with thine."
5096,BOOK VI,Be the strong shield of Trojans hard-bestead:
5097,BOOK VI,"Win us a breathing-space.  Thou only, I trow,"
5098,BOOK VI,"From perishing Troy canst thrust the dark doom back."""
5099,BOOK VI,
5100,BOOK VI,With kindling words he spake.  That hero cried:
5101,BOOK VI,"""Great-hearted Paris, like the Blessed Ones"
5102,BOOK VI,"In goodlihead, this lieth foreordained"
5103,BOOK VI,"On the Gods' knees, who in the fight shall fall,"
5104,BOOK VI,"And who outlive it.  I, as honour bids,"
5105,BOOK VI,"And as my strength sufficeth, will not flinch"
5106,BOOK VI,From Troy's defence.  I swear to turn from fight
5107,BOOK VI,"Never, except in victory or death."""
5108,BOOK VI,
5109,BOOK VI,Gallantly spake he: with exceeding joy
5110,BOOK VI,"Rejoiced the Trojans.  Champions then he chose,"
5111,BOOK VI,"Alexander and Aeneas fiery-souled,"
5112,BOOK VI,"Polydamas, Pammon, and Deiphobus,"
5113,BOOK VI,"And Aethicus, of Paphlagonian men"
5114,BOOK VI,The staunchest man to stem the tide of war;
5115,BOOK VI,"These chose he, cunning all in battle-toil,"
5116,BOOK VI,To meet the foe in forefront of the fight.
5117,BOOK VI,Swiftly they strode before that warrior-throng
5118,BOOK VI,Then from the city cheering charged.  The host
5119,BOOK VI,"Followed them in their thousands, as when bees"
5120,BOOK VI,"Follow by bands their leaders from the hives,"
5121,BOOK VI,With loud hum on a spring day pouring forth.
5122,BOOK VI,So to the fight the warriors followed these;
5123,BOOK VI,"And, as they charged, the thunder-tramp of men"
5124,BOOK VI,"And steeds, and clang of armour, rang to heaven."
5125,BOOK VI,As when a rushing mighty wind stirs up
5126,BOOK VI,"The barren sea-plain from its nethermost floor,"
5127,BOOK VI,And darkling to the strand roll roaring waves
5128,BOOK VI,"Belching sea-tangle from the bursting surf,"
5129,BOOK VI,And wild sounds rise from beaches harvestless;
5130,BOOK VI,"So, as they charged, the wide earth rang again."
5131,BOOK VI,
5132,BOOK VI,Now from their rampart forth the Argives poured
5133,BOOK VI,Round godlike Agamemnon.  Rang their shouts
5134,BOOK VI,"Cheering each other on to face the fight,"
5135,BOOK VI,And not to cower beside the ships in dread
5136,BOOK VI,Of onset-shouts of battle-eager foes.
5137,BOOK VI,They met those charging hosts with hearts as light
5138,BOOK VI,"As calves bear, when they leap to meet the kine"
5139,BOOK VI,Down faring from hill-pastures in the spring
5140,BOOK VI,"Unto the steading, when the fields are green"
5141,BOOK VI,"With corn-blades, when the earth is glad with flowers,"
5142,BOOK VI,"And bowls are brimmed with milk of kine and ewes,"
5143,BOOK VI,And multitudinous lowing far and near
5144,BOOK VI,"Uprises as the mothers meet their young,"
5145,BOOK VI,And in their midst the herdman joys; so great
5146,BOOK VI,Was the uproar that rose when met the fronts
5147,BOOK VI,Of battle: dread it rang on either hand.
5148,BOOK VI,Hard-strained was then the fight: incarnate
5149,BOOK VI,"Strife Stalked through the midst, with Slaughter ghastly-faced."
5150,BOOK VI,"Crashed bull-hide shields, and spears, and helmet-crests"
5151,BOOK VI,Meeting: the brass flashed out like leaping flames.
5152,BOOK VI,Bristled the battle with the lances; earth
5153,BOOK VI,"Ran red with blood, as slaughtered heroes fell"
5154,BOOK VI,"And horses, mid a tangle of shattered ears,"
5155,BOOK VI,"Some yet with spear-wounds gasping, while on them"
5156,BOOK VI,Others were falling.  Through the air upshrieked
5157,BOOK VI,An awful indistinguishable roar;
5158,BOOK VI,For on both hosts fell iron-hearted Strife.
5159,BOOK VI,"Here were men hurling cruel jagged stones,"
5160,BOOK VI,"There speeding arrows and new-whetted darts,"
5161,BOOK VI,"There with the axe or twibill hewing hard,"
5162,BOOK VI,"Slashing with swords, and thrusting out with spears:"
5163,BOOK VI,Their mad hands clutched all manner of tools of death.
5164,BOOK VI,
5165,BOOK VI,At first the Argives bore the ranks of Troy
5166,BOOK VI,"Backward a little; but they rallied, charged,"
5167,BOOK VI,"Leapt on the foe, and drenched the field with blood."
5168,BOOK VI,Like a black hurricane rushed Eurypylus
5169,BOOK VI,"Cheering his men on, hewing Argives down"
5170,BOOK VI,Awelessly: measureless might was lent to him
5171,BOOK VI,"By Zeus, for a grace to glorious Hercules."
5172,BOOK VI,"Nireus, a man in beauty like the Gods,"
5173,BOOK VI,"His spear long-shafted stabbed beneath the ribs,"
5174,BOOK VI,"Down on the plain he fell, forth streamed the blood"
5175,BOOK VI,"Drenching his splendid arms, drenching the form"
5176,BOOK VI,"Glorious of mould, and his thick-clustering hair."
5177,BOOK VI,"There mid the slain in dust and blood he lay,"
5178,BOOK VI,"Like a young lusty olive-sapling, which"
5179,BOOK VI,"A river rushing down in roaring flood,"
5180,BOOK VI,"Tearing its banks away, and cleaving wide"
5181,BOOK VI,"A chasm-channel, hath disrooted; low"
5182,BOOK VI,It lieth heavy-blossomed; so lay then
5183,BOOK VI,"The goodly form, the grace of loveliness"
5184,BOOK VI,Of Nireus on earth's breast.  But o'er the slain
5185,BOOK VI,Loud rang the taunting of Eurypylus:
5186,BOOK VI,"""Lie there in dust!  Thy beauty marvellous"
5187,BOOK VI,Naught hath availed thee!  I have plucked thee away
5188,BOOK VI,"From life, to which thou wast so fain to cling."
5189,BOOK VI,"Rash fool, who didst defy a mightier man"
5190,BOOK VI,"Unknowing!  Beauty is no match for strength!"""
5191,BOOK VI,
5192,BOOK VI,"He spake, and leapt upon the slain to strip"
5193,BOOK VI,His goodly arms: but now against him came
5194,BOOK VI,"Machaon wroth for Nireus, by his side"
5195,BOOK VI,Doom-overtaken.  With his spear he drave
5196,BOOK VI,"At his right shoulder: strong albeit he was,"
5197,BOOK VI,"He touched him, and blood spurted from the gash."
5198,BOOK VI,"Yet, ere he might leap back from grapple of death,"
5199,BOOK VI,Even as a lion or fierce mountain-boar
5200,BOOK VI,"Maddens mid thronging huntsmen, furious-fain"
5201,BOOK VI,To rend the man whose hand first wounded him;
5202,BOOK VI,So fierce Eurypylus on Machaon rushed.
5203,BOOK VI,"The long lance shot out swiftly, and pierced him through"
5204,BOOK VI,"On the right haunch; yet would he not give back,"
5205,BOOK VI,"Nor flinch from the onset, fast though flowed the blood."
5206,BOOK VI,"In haste he snatched a huge stone from the ground,"
5207,BOOK VI,And dashed it on the head of Telephus' son;
5208,BOOK VI,But his helm warded him from death or harm
5209,BOOK VI,Then waxed Eurypylus more hotly wroth
5210,BOOK VI,"With that strong warrior, and in fury of soul"
5211,BOOK VI,"Clear through Machaon's breast he drave his spear,"
5212,BOOK VI,And through the midriff passed the gory point.
5213,BOOK VI,"He fell, as falls beneath a lion's jaws"
5214,BOOK VI,"A bull, and round him clashed his glancing arms."
5215,BOOK VI,Swiftly Eurypylus plucked the lance of death
5216,BOOK VI,"Out of the wound, and vaunting cried aloud:"
5217,BOOK VI,"""Wretch, wisdom was not bound up in thine heart,"
5218,BOOK VI,"That thou, a weakling, didst come forth to fight"
5219,BOOK VI,A mightier.  Therefore art thou in the toils
5220,BOOK VI,"Of Doom.  Much profit shall be thine, when kites"
5221,BOOK VI,Devour the flesh of thee in battle slain!
5222,BOOK VI,"Ha, dost thou hope still to return, to 'scape"
5223,BOOK VI,"Mine hands?  A leech art thou, and soothing salves"
5224,BOOK VI,"Thou knowest, and by these didst haply hope"
5225,BOOK VI,"To flee the evil day!  Not thine own sire,"
5226,BOOK VI,"On the wind's wings descending from Olympus,"
5227,BOOK VI,"Should save thy life, not though between thy lips"
5228,BOOK VI,"He should pour nectar and ambrosia!"""
5229,BOOK VI,
5230,BOOK VI,Faint-breathing answered him the dying man:
5231,BOOK VI,"""Eurypylus, thine own weird is to live"
5232,BOOK VI,Not long: Fate is at point to meet thee here
5233,BOOK VI,"On Troy's plain, and to still thine impious tongue."""
5234,BOOK VI,
5235,BOOK VI,So passed his spirit into Hades' halls.
5236,BOOK VI,Then to the dead man spake his conqueror:
5237,BOOK VI,"""Now on the earth lie thou.  What shall betide"
5238,BOOK VI,"Hereafter, care I not--yea, though this day"
5239,BOOK VI,Death's doom stand by my feet: no man may live
5240,BOOK VI,"For ever: each man's fate is foreordained."""
5241,BOOK VI,
5242,BOOK VI,Stabbing the corpse he spake.  Then shouted loud
5243,BOOK VI,"Teucer, at seeing Machaon in the dust."
5244,BOOK VI,"Far thence he stood hard-toiling in the fight,"
5245,BOOK VI,For on the centre sore the battle lay:
5246,BOOK VI,Foe after foe pressed on; yet not for this
5247,BOOK VI,"Was Teucer heedless of the fallen brave,"
5248,BOOK VI,Neither of Nireus lying hard thereby
5249,BOOK VI,"Behind Machaon in the dust.  He saw,"
5250,BOOK VI,
5251,BOOK VI,And with a great voice raised the rescue-cry:
5252,BOOK VI,"""Charge, Argives!  Flinch not from the charging foe!"
5253,BOOK VI,For shame unspeakable shall cover us
5254,BOOK VI,If Trojan men hale back to Ilium
5255,BOOK VI,Noble Machaon and Nireus godlike-fair.
5256,BOOK VI,"Come, with a good heart let us face the foe"
5257,BOOK VI,"To rescue these slain friends, or fall ourselves"
5258,BOOK VI,Beside them.  Duty bids that men defend
5259,BOOK VI,"Friends, and to aliens leave them not a prey,"
5260,BOOK VI,"Not without sweat of toil is glory won!"""
5261,BOOK VI,
5262,BOOK VI,Then were the Danaans anguish-stung: the earth
5263,BOOK VI,"All round them dyed they red with blood of slain,"
5264,BOOK VI,As foe fought foe in even-balanced fight.
5265,BOOK VI,By this to Podaleirius tidings came
5266,BOOK VI,"How that in dust his brother lay, struck down"
5267,BOOK VI,By woeful death.  Beside the ships he sat
5268,BOOK VI,Ministering to the hurts of men with spears
5269,BOOK VI,"Stricken.  In wrath for his brother's sake he rose,"
5270,BOOK VI,He clad him in his armour; in his breast
5271,BOOK VI,Dread battle-prowess swelled.  For conflict grim
5272,BOOK VI,He panted: boiled the mad blood round his heart
5273,BOOK VI,He leapt amidst the foemen; his swift hands
5274,BOOK VI,"Swung the snake-headed javelin up, and hurled,"
5275,BOOK VI,And slew with its winged speed Agamestor's son
5276,BOOK VI,"Cleitus, a bright-haired Nymph had given him birth"
5277,BOOK VI,"Beside Parthenius, whose quiet stream"
5278,BOOK VI,"Fleets smooth as oil through green lands, till it pours"
5279,BOOK VI,Its shining ripples to the Euxine sea.
5280,BOOK VI,Then by his warrior-brother laid he low
5281,BOOK VI,"Lassus, whom Pronoe, fair as a goddess, bare"
5282,BOOK VI,"Beside Nymphaeus' stream, hard by a cave,"
5283,BOOK VI,A wide and wondrous cave: sacred it is
5284,BOOK VI,"Men say, unto the Nymphs, even all that haunt"
5285,BOOK VI,"The long-ridged Paphlagonian hills, and all"
5286,BOOK VI,That by full-clustered Heracleia dwell.
5287,BOOK VI,"That cave is like the work of gods, of stone"
5288,BOOK VI,In manner marvellous moulded: through it flows
5289,BOOK VI,Cold water crystal-clear: in niches round
5290,BOOK VI,"Stand bowls of stone upon the rugged rock,"
5291,BOOK VI,Seeming as they were wrought by carvers' hands.
5292,BOOK VI,"Statues of Wood-gods stand around, fair Nymphs,"
5293,BOOK VI,"Looms, distaffs, all such things as mortal craft"
5294,BOOK VI,Fashioneth.  Wondrous seem they unto men
5295,BOOK VI,"Which pass into that hallowed cave.  It hath,"
5296,BOOK VI,"Up-leading and down-leading, doorways twain,"
5297,BOOK VI,"Facing, the one, the wild North's shrilling blasts,"
5298,BOOK VI,And one the dank rain-burdened South.  By this
5299,BOOK VI,Do mortals pass beneath the Nymphs' wide cave;
5300,BOOK VI,But that is the Immortals' path: no man
5301,BOOK VI,"May tread it, for a chasm deep and wide"
5302,BOOK VI,"Down-reaching unto Hades, yawns between."
5303,BOOK VI,This track the Blest Gods may alone behold.
5304,BOOK VI,So died a host on either side that warred
5305,BOOK VI,Over Machaon and Aglaia's son.
5306,BOOK VI,But at the last through desperate wrestle of fight
5307,BOOK VI,The Danaans rescued them: yet few were they
5308,BOOK VI,Which bare them to the ships: by bitter stress
5309,BOOK VI,"Of conflict were the more part compassed round,"
5310,BOOK VI,And needs must still abide the battle's brunt.
5311,BOOK VI,But when full many had filled the measure up
5312,BOOK VI,"Of fate, mid tumult, blood and agony,"
5313,BOOK VI,Then to their ships did many Argives flee
5314,BOOK VI,"Pressed by Eurypylus hard, an avalanche"
5315,BOOK VI,Of havoc.  Yet a few abode the strife
5316,BOOK VI,Round Aias and the Atreidae rallying;
5317,BOOK VI,"And haply these had perished all, beset"
5318,BOOK VI,"By throngs on throngs of foes on every hand,"
5319,BOOK VI,Had not Oileus' son stabbed with his spear
5320,BOOK VI,'Twixt shoulder and breast war-wise Polydamas;
5321,BOOK VI,"Forth gushed the blood, and he recoiled a space."
5322,BOOK VI,Then Menelaus pierced Deiphobus
5323,BOOK VI,"By the right breast, that with swift feet he fled."
5324,BOOK VI,And many of that slaughter-breathing throng
5325,BOOK VI,Were slain by Agamemnon: furiously
5326,BOOK VI,He rushed on godlike Aethicus with the spear;
5327,BOOK VI,But he shrank from the forefront back mid friends.
5328,BOOK VI,
5329,BOOK VI,Now when Eurypylus the battle-stay
5330,BOOK VI,"Marked how the ranks of Troy gave back from fight,"
5331,BOOK VI,He turned him from the host that he had chased
5332,BOOK VI,"Even to the ships, and rushed with eagle-swoop"
5333,BOOK VI,On Atreus' strong sons and Oileus' seed
5334,BOOK VI,"Stout-hearted, who was passing fleet of foot"
5335,BOOK VI,And in fight peerless.  Swiftly he charged on these
5336,BOOK VI,Grasping his spear long-shafted: at Iris side
5337,BOOK VI,"Charged Paris, charged Aeneas stout of heart,"
5338,BOOK VI,"Who hurled a stone exceeding huge, that crashed"
5339,BOOK VI,"On Aias' helmet: dashed to the dust he was,"
5340,BOOK VI,"Yet gave not up the ghost, whose day of doom"
5341,BOOK VI,Was fate-ordained amidst Caphaerus' rocks
5342,BOOK VI,On the home-voyage.  Now his valiant men
5343,BOOK VI,"Out of the foes' hands snatched him, bare him thence,"
5344,BOOK VI,"Scarce drawing breath, to the Achaean ships."
5345,BOOK VI,"And now the Atreid kings, the war-renowned,"
5346,BOOK VI,"Were left alone, and murder-breathing foes"
5347,BOOK VI,"Encompassed them, and hurled from every side"
5348,BOOK VI,Whate'er their hands might find the deadly shaft
5349,BOOK VI,"Some showered, some the stone, the javelin some."
5350,BOOK VI,"They in the midst aye turned this way and that,"
5351,BOOK VI,As boars or lions compassed round with pales
5352,BOOK VI,On that day when kings gather to the sport
5353,BOOK VI,"The people, and have penned the mighty beasts"
5354,BOOK VI,"Within the toils of death; but these, although"
5355,BOOK VI,"With walls ringed round, yet tear with tusk and fang"
5356,BOOK VI,What luckless thrall soever draweth near.
5357,BOOK VI,So these death-compassed heroes slew their foes
5358,BOOK VI,Ever as they pressed on.  Yet had their might
5359,BOOK VI,"Availed not for defence, for all their will,"
5360,BOOK VI,Had Teucer and Idomeneus strong of heart
5361,BOOK VI,"Come not to help, with Thoas, Meriones,"
5362,BOOK VI,"And godlike Thrasymedes, they which shrank"
5363,BOOK VI,"Erewhile before Eurypylus yea, had fled"
5364,BOOK VI,"Unto the ships to 'scape the crushing doom,"
5365,BOOK VI,"But that, in fear for Atreus' sons, they rallied"
5366,BOOK VI,Against Eurypylus: deadly waxed the fight.
5367,BOOK VI,
5368,BOOK VI,Then Teucer with a mighty spear-thrust smote
5369,BOOK VI,"Aeneas' shield, yet wounded not his flesh,"
5370,BOOK VI,For the great fourfold buckler warded him;
5371,BOOK VI,"Yet feared he, and recoiled a little space."
5372,BOOK VI,Leapt Meriones upon Laophoon
5373,BOOK VI,"The son of Paeon, born by Axius' flood"
5374,BOOK VI,Of bright-haired Cleomede.  Unto Troy
5375,BOOK VI,With noble Asteropaeus had he come
5376,BOOK VI,To aid her folk: him Meriones' keen spear
5377,BOOK VI,"Stabbed 'neath the navel, and the lance-head tore"
5378,BOOK VI,His bowels forth; swift sped his soul away
5379,BOOK VI,"Into the Shadow-land.  Alcimedes,"
5380,BOOK VI,"The warrior-friend of Aias, Oileus' son,"
5381,BOOK VI,Shot mid the press of Trojans; for he sped
5382,BOOK VI,With taunting shout a sharp stone from a sling
5383,BOOK VI,Into their battle's heart.  They quailed in fear
5384,BOOK VI,Before the hum and onrush of the bolt.
5385,BOOK VI,Fate winged its flight to the bold charioteer
5386,BOOK VI,"Of Pammon, Hippasus' son: his brow it smote"
5387,BOOK VI,"While yet he grasped the reins, and flung him stunned"
5388,BOOK VI,Down from the chariot-seat before the wheels.
5389,BOOK VI,The rushing war-wain whirled his wretched form
5390,BOOK VI,"'Twixt tyres and heels of onward-leaping steeds,"
5391,BOOK VI,And awful death in that hour swallowed him
5392,BOOK VI,When whip and reins had flown from his nerveless hands.
5393,BOOK VI,Then grief thrilled Pammon: hard necessity
5394,BOOK VI,Made him both chariot-lord and charioteer.
5395,BOOK VI,"Now to his doom and death-day had he bowed,"
5396,BOOK VI,Had not a Trojan through that gory strife
5397,BOOK VI,"Leapt, grasped the reins, and saved the prince, when now"
5398,BOOK VI,His strength failed 'neath the murderous hands of foes.
5399,BOOK VI,
5400,BOOK VI,"As godlike Acamas charged, the stalwart son"
5401,BOOK VI,"Of Nestor thrust the spear above his knee,"
5402,BOOK VI,And with that wound sore anguish came on him:
5403,BOOK VI,Back from the fight he drew; the deadly strife
5404,BOOK VI,He left unto his comrades: quenched was now
5405,BOOK VI,His battle-lust.  Eurypylus' henchman smote
5406,BOOK VI,"Echemmon, Thoas' friend, amidst the fray"
5407,BOOK VI,Beneath the shoulder: nigh his heart the spear
5408,BOOK VI,Passed bitter-biting: o'er his limbs brake out
5409,BOOK VI,Mingled with blood cold sweat of agony.
5410,BOOK VI,He turned to flee; Eurypylus' giant might
5411,BOOK VI,"Chased, caught him, shearing his heel-tendons through:"
5412,BOOK VI,"There, where the blow fell, his reluctant feet"
5413,BOOK VI,"Stayed, and the spirit left his mortal frame."
5414,BOOK VI,Thoas pricked Paris with quick-thrusting spear
5415,BOOK VI,On the right thigh: backward a space he ran
5416,BOOK VI,"For his death-speeding bow, which had been left"
5417,BOOK VI,To rearward of the fight.  Idomeneus
5418,BOOK VI,"Upheaved a stone, huge as his hands could swing,"
5419,BOOK VI,And dashed it on Eurypylus' arm: to earth
5420,BOOK VI,Fell his death-dealing spear.  Backward he stepped
5421,BOOK VI,"To grasp another, since from out his hand"
5422,BOOK VI,The first was smitten.  So had Atreus' sons
5423,BOOK VI,A moment's breathing-space from stress of war.
5424,BOOK VI,But swiftly drew Eurypylus' henchmen near
5425,BOOK VI,"Bearing a stubborn-shafted lance, wherewith"
5426,BOOK VI,He brake the strength of many.  In stormy might
5427,BOOK VI,Then charged he on the foe: whomso he met
5428,BOOK VI,"He slew, and spread wide havoc through their ranks."
5429,BOOK VI,
5430,BOOK VI,"Now neither Atreus' sons might steadfast stand,"
5431,BOOK VI,"Nor any valiant Danaan beside,"
5432,BOOK VI,For ruinous panic suddenly gripped the hearts
5433,BOOK VI,Of all; for on them all Eurypylus rushed
5434,BOOK VI,"Flashing death in their faces, chased them, slew,"
5435,BOOK VI,Cried to the Trojans and to his chariot-lords:
5436,BOOK VI,"""Friends, be of good heart!  To these Danaans"
5437,BOOK VI,Let us deal slaughter and doom's darkness now!
5438,BOOK VI,"Lo, how like scared sheep back to the ships they flee!"
5439,BOOK VI,"Forget not your death-dealing battle-lore,"
5440,BOOK VI,"O ye that from your youth are men of war!"""
5441,BOOK VI,
5442,BOOK VI,Then charged they on the Argives as one man;
5443,BOOK VI,And these in utter panic turned and fled
5444,BOOK VI,"The bitter battle, those hard after them"
5445,BOOK VI,"Followed, as white-fanged hounds hold deer in chase"
5446,BOOK VI,Up the long forest-glens.  Full many in dust
5447,BOOK VI,"They dashed down, howsoe'er they longed to escape."
5448,BOOK VI,The slaughter grim and great of that wild fray.
5449,BOOK VI,"Eurypylus hath slain Bucolion,"
5450,BOOK VI,"Nesus, and Chromion and Antiphus;"
5451,BOOK VI,"Twain in Mycenae dwelt, a goodly land;"
5452,BOOK VI,In Lacedaemon twain.  Men of renown
5453,BOOK VI,"Albeit they were, he slew them.  Then he smote"
5454,BOOK VI,A host unnumbered of the common throng.
5455,BOOK VI,"My strength should not suffice to sing their fate,"
5456,BOOK VI,"How fain soever, though within my breast"
5457,BOOK VI,Were iron lungs.  Aeneas slew withal
5458,BOOK VI,"Antimachus and Pheres, twain which left"
5459,BOOK VI,Crete with Idomeneus.  Agenor smote
5460,BOOK VI,"Molus the princely,--with king Sthenelus"
5461,BOOK VI,"He came from Argos,--hurled from far behind"
5462,BOOK VI,"A dart new-whetted, as he fled from fight,"
5463,BOOK VI,"Piercing his right leg, and the eager shaft"
5464,BOOK VI,"Cut sheer through the broad sinew, shattering"
5465,BOOK VI,The bones with anguished pain: and so his doom
5466,BOOK VI,"Met him, to die a death of agony."
5467,BOOK VI,"Then Paris' arrows laid proud Phorcys low,"
5468,BOOK VI,"And Mosynus, brethren both, from Salamis"
5469,BOOK VI,"Who came in Aias' ships, and nevermore"
5470,BOOK VI,"Saw the home-land.  Cleolaus smote he next,"
5471,BOOK VI,Meges' stout henchman; for the arrow struck
5472,BOOK VI,"His left breast: deadly night enwrapped him round,"
5473,BOOK VI,And his soul fleeted forth: his fainting heart
5474,BOOK VI,Still in his breast fluttering convulsively
5475,BOOK VI,Made the winged arrow shiver.  Yet again
5476,BOOK VI,Did Paris shoot at bold Eetion.
5477,BOOK VI,Through his jaw leapt the sudden-flashing brass:
5478,BOOK VI,"He groaned, and with his blood were mingled tears."
5479,BOOK VI,"So ever man slew man, till all the space"
5480,BOOK VI,Was heaped with Argives each on other cast.
5481,BOOK VI,"Now had the Trojans burnt with fire the ships,"
5482,BOOK VI,"Had not night, trailing heavy-folded mist,"
5483,BOOK VI,"Uprisen.  So Eurypylus drew back,"
5484,BOOK VI,"And Troy's sons with him, from the ships aloof"
5485,BOOK VI,"A little space, by Simois' outfall; there"
5486,BOOK VI,Camped they exultant.  But amidst the ships
5487,BOOK VI,Flung down upon the sands the Argives wailed
5488,BOOK VI,"Heart-anguished for the slain, so many of whom"
5489,BOOK VI,Dark fate had overtaken and laid in dust.
5490,BOOK VI,
5491,BOOK VI,
5492,BOOK VI,
5493,BOOK VII,BOOK VII
5494,BOOK VII,
5495,BOOK VII,How the Son of Achilles was brought to the War from the Isle of Scyros.
5496,BOOK VII,
5497,BOOK VII,
5498,BOOK VII,"When heaven hid his stars, and Dawn awoke"
5499,BOOK VII,"Outspraying splendour, and night's darkness fled,"
5500,BOOK VII,Then undismayed the Argives' warrior-sons
5501,BOOK VII,Marched forth without the ships to meet in fight
5502,BOOK VII,"Eurypylus, save those that tarried still"
5503,BOOK VII,To render to Machaon midst the ships
5504,BOOK VII,"Death-dues, with Nireus--Nireus, who in grace"
5505,BOOK VII,"And goodlihead was like the Deathless Ones,"
5506,BOOK VII,Yet was not strong in bodily might: the Gods
5507,BOOK VII,Grant not perfection in all things to men;
5508,BOOK VII,But evil still is blended with the good
5509,BOOK VII,By some strange fate: to Nireus' winsome grace
5510,BOOK VII,Was linked a weakling's prowess.  Yet the Greeks
5511,BOOK VII,"Slighted him not, but gave him all death-dues,"
5512,BOOK VII,And mourned above his grave with no less grief
5513,BOOK VII,"Than for Machaon, whom they honoured aye,"
5514,BOOK VII,"For his deep wisdom, as the immortal Gods."
5515,BOOK VII,One mound they swiftly heaped above these twain.
5516,BOOK VII,
5517,BOOK VII,Then in the plain once more did murderous war
5518,BOOK VII,Madden: the multitudinous clash and cry
5519,BOOK VII,"Rose, as the shields were shattered with huge stones,"
5520,BOOK VII,Were pierced with lances.  So they toiled in fight;
5521,BOOK VII,But all this while lay Podaleirius
5522,BOOK VII,"Fasting in dust and groaning, leaving not"
5523,BOOK VII,His brother's tomb; and oft his heart was moved
5524,BOOK VII,With his own hands to slay himself.  And now
5525,BOOK VII,"He clutched his sword, and now amidst his herbs"
5526,BOOK VII,Sought for a deadly drug; and still his friends
5527,BOOK VII,Essayed to stay his hand and comfort him
5528,BOOK VII,With many pleadings.  But he would not cease
5529,BOOK VII,"From grieving: yea, his hands had spilt his life"
5530,BOOK VII,"There on his noble brother's new-made tomb,"
5531,BOOK VII,"But Nestor heard thereof, and sorrowed sore"
5532,BOOK VII,"In his affliction, and he came on him"
5533,BOOK VII,"As now he flung him on that woeful grave,"
5534,BOOK VII,"And now was casting dust upon his head,"
5535,BOOK VII,"Beating his breast, and on his brother's name"
5536,BOOK VII,"Crying, while thralls and comrades round their lord"
5537,BOOK VII,"Groaned, and affliction held them one and all."
5538,BOOK VII,Then gently spake he to that stricken one:
5539,BOOK VII,"""Refrain from bitter moan and deadly grief,"
5540,BOOK VII,My son.  It is not for a wise man's honour
5541,BOOK VII,"To wail, as doth a woman, o'er the fallen."
5542,BOOK VII,Thou shalt not bring him up to light again
5543,BOOK VII,"Whose soul hath fleeted vanishing into air,"
5544,BOOK VII,"Whose body fire hath ravined up, whose bones"
5545,BOOK VII,Earth has received.  His end was worthy his life.
5546,BOOK VII,"Endure thy sore grief, even as I endured,"
5547,BOOK VII,"Who lost a son, slain by the hands of foes,"
5548,BOOK VII,"A son not worse than thy Machaon, good"
5549,BOOK VII,"With spears in battle, good in counsel.  None"
5550,BOOK VII,Of all the youths so loved his sire as he
5551,BOOK VII,"Loved me.  He died for me yea, died to save"
5552,BOOK VII,"His father.  Yet, when he was slain, did I"
5553,BOOK VII,"Endure to taste food, and to see the light,"
5554,BOOK VII,Well knowing that all men must tread one path
5555,BOOK VII,"Hades-ward, and before all lies one goal,"
5556,BOOK VII,Death's mournful goal.  A mortal man must bear
5557,BOOK VII,"All joys, all griefs, that God vouchsafes to send."""
5558,BOOK VII,
5559,BOOK VII,"Made answer that heart-stricken one, while still"
5560,BOOK VII,Wet were his cheeks with ever-flowing tears:
5561,BOOK VII,"""Father, mine heart is bowed 'neath crushing grief"
5562,BOOK VII,"For a brother passing wise, who fostered me"
5563,BOOK VII,Even as a son.  When to the heavens had passed
5564,BOOK VII,"Our father, in his arms he cradled me:"
5565,BOOK VII,Gladly he taught me all his healing lore;
5566,BOOK VII,We shared one table; in one bed we lay:
5567,BOOK VII,"We had all things in common these, and love."
5568,BOOK VII,"My grief cannot forget, nor I desire,"
5569,BOOK VII,"Now he is dead, to see the light of life."""
5570,BOOK VII,
5571,BOOK VII,Then spake the old man to that stricken one:
5572,BOOK VII,"""To all men Fate assigns one same sad lot,"
5573,BOOK VII,"Bereavement: earth shall cover all alike,"
5574,BOOK VII,"Albeit we tread not the same path of life,"
5575,BOOK VII,And none the path he chooseth; for on high
5576,BOOK VII,Good things and bad lie on the knees of
5577,BOOK VII,"Gods Unnumbered, indistinguishably blent."
5578,BOOK VII,These no Immortal seeth; they are veiled
5579,BOOK VII,In mystic cloud-folds.  Only Fate puts forth
5580,BOOK VII,"Her hands thereto, nor looks at what she takes,"
5581,BOOK VII,But casts them from Olympus down to earth.
5582,BOOK VII,"This way and that they are wafted, as it were"
5583,BOOK VII,By gusts of wind.  The good man oft is whelmed
5584,BOOK VII,In suffering: wealth undeserved is heaped
5585,BOOK VII,On the vile person.  Blind is each man's life;
5586,BOOK VII,Therefore he never walketh surely; oft
5587,BOOK VII,"He stumbleth: ever devious is his path,"
5588,BOOK VII,"Now sloping down to sorrow, mounting now"
5589,BOOK VII,To bliss.  All-happy is no living man
5590,BOOK VII,"From the beginning to the end, but still"
5591,BOOK VII,The good and evil clash.  Our life is short;
5592,BOOK VII,"Beseems not then in grief to live.  Hope on,"
5593,BOOK VII,Still hope for better days: chain not to woe
5594,BOOK VII,Thine heart.  There is a saying among men
5595,BOOK VII,That to the heavens unperishing mount the souls
5596,BOOK VII,"Of good men, and to nether darkness sink"
5597,BOOK VII,Souls of the wicked.  Both to God and man
5598,BOOK VII,"Dear was thy brother, good to brother-men,"
5599,BOOK VII,And son of an Immortal.  Sure am I
5600,BOOK VII,That to the company of Gods shall he
5601,BOOK VII,"Ascend, by intercession of thy sire."""
5602,BOOK VII,
5603,BOOK VII,Then raised he that reluctant mourner up
5604,BOOK VII,With comfortable words.  From that dark grave
5605,BOOK VII,"He drew him, backward gazing oft with groans."
5606,BOOK VII,"To the ships they came, where Greeks and Trojan men"
5607,BOOK VII,Had bitter travail of rekindled war.
5608,BOOK VII,
5609,BOOK VII,"Eurypylus there, in dauntless spirit like"
5610,BOOK VII,"The War-god, with mad-raging spear and hands"
5611,BOOK VII,"Resistless, smote down hosts of foes: the earth"
5612,BOOK VII,Was clogged with dead men slain on either side.
5613,BOOK VII,"On strode he midst the corpses, awelessly"
5614,BOOK VII,"He fought, with blood-bespattered hands and feet;"
5615,BOOK VII,Never a moment from grim strife he ceased.
5616,BOOK VII,Peneleos the mighty-hearted came
5617,BOOK VII,Against him in the pitiless fray: he fell
5618,BOOK VII,"Before Eurypylus' spear: yea, many more"
5619,BOOK VII,"Fell round him.  Ceased not those destroying hands,"
5620,BOOK VII,"But wrathful on the Argives still he pressed,"
5621,BOOK VII,As when of old on Pholoe's long-ridged heights
5622,BOOK VII,Upon the Centaurs terrible Hercules rushed
5623,BOOK VII,"Storming in might, and slew them, passing-swift"
5624,BOOK VII,And strong and battle-cunning though they were;
5625,BOOK VII,"So rushed he on, so smote he down the array,"
5626,BOOK VII,"One after other, of the Danaan spears."
5627,BOOK VII,"Heaps upon heaps, here, there, in throngs they fell"
5628,BOOK VII,Strewn in the dust.  As when a river in flood
5629,BOOK VII,"Comes thundering down, banks crumble on either side"
5630,BOOK VII,To drifting sand: on seaward rolls the surge
5631,BOOK VII,"Tossing wild crests, while cliffs on every hand"
5632,BOOK VII,"Ring crashing echoes, as their brows break down"
5633,BOOK VII,"Beneath long-leaping roaring waterfalls,"
5634,BOOK VII,And dikes are swept away; so fell in dust
5635,BOOK VII,"The war-famed Argives by Eurypylus slain,"
5636,BOOK VII,Such as he overtook in that red rout.
5637,BOOK VII,"Some few escaped, whom strength of fleeing feet"
5638,BOOK VII,Delivered.  Yet in that sore strait they drew
5639,BOOK VII,"Peneleos from the shrieking tumult forth,"
5640,BOOK VII,"And bare to the ships, though with swift feet themselves"
5641,BOOK VII,"Were fleeing from ghastly death, from pitiless doom."
5642,BOOK VII,Behind the rampart of the ships they fled
5643,BOOK VII,In huddled rout: they had no heart to stand
5644,BOOK VII,"Before Eurypylus, for Hercules,"
5645,BOOK VII,"To crown with glory his son's stalwart son,"
5646,BOOK VII,Thrilled them with panic.  There behind their wall
5647,BOOK VII,"They cowered, as goats to leeward of a hill"
5648,BOOK VII,Shrink from the wild cold rushing of the wind
5649,BOOK VII,That bringeth snow and heavy sleet and haft.
5650,BOOK VII,No longing for the pasture tempteth them
5651,BOOK VII,"Over the brow to step, and face the blast,"
5652,BOOK VII,But huddling screened by rock-wall and ravine
5653,BOOK VII,"They abide the storm, and crop the scanty grass"
5654,BOOK VII,"Under dim copses thronging, till the gusts"
5655,BOOK VII,"Of that ill wind shall lull: so, by their towers"
5656,BOOK VII,"Screened, did the trembling Danaans abide"
5657,BOOK VII,"Telephus' mighty son.  Yea, he had burnt"
5658,BOOK VII,"The ships, and all that host had he destroyed,"
5659,BOOK VII,Had not Athena at the last inspired
5660,BOOK VII,The Argive men with courage.  Ceaselessly
5661,BOOK VII,From the high rampart hurled they at the foe
5662,BOOK VII,"With bitter-biting darts, and slew them fast;"
5663,BOOK VII,"And all the walls were splashed with reeking gore,"
5664,BOOK VII,And aye went up a moan of smitten men.
5665,BOOK VII,
5666,BOOK VII,"So fought they: nightlong, daylong fought they on,"
5667,BOOK VII,"Ceteians, Trojans, battle-biding Greeks,"
5668,BOOK VII,"Fought, now before the ships, and now again"
5669,BOOK VII,"Round the steep wall, with fury unutterable."
5670,BOOK VII,Yet even so for two days did they cease
5671,BOOK VII,From murderous fight; for to Eurypylus came
5672,BOOK VII,"A Danaan embassage, saying, ""From the war"
5673,BOOK VII,"Forbear we, while we give unto the flames"
5674,BOOK VII,"The battle-slain.""  So hearkened he to them:"
5675,BOOK VII,From ruin-wreaking strife forebore the hosts;
5676,BOOK VII,"And so their dead they buried, who in dust"
5677,BOOK VII,Had fallen.  Chiefly the Achaeans mourned
5678,BOOK VII,Peneleos; o'er the mighty dead they heaped
5679,BOOK VII,"A barrow broad and high, a sign for men"
5680,BOOK VII,Of days to be.  But in a several place
5681,BOOK VII,"The multitude of heroes slain they laid,"
5682,BOOK VII,Mourning with stricken hearts.  On one great pyre
5683,BOOK VII,"They burnt them all, and buried in one grave."
5684,BOOK VII,So likewise far from thence the sons of Troy
5685,BOOK VII,"Buried their slain.  Yet murderous Strife slept not,"
5686,BOOK VII,But roused again Eurypylus' dauntless might
5687,BOOK VII,"To meet the foe.  He turned not from the ships,"
5688,BOOK VII,"But there abode, and fanned the fury of war."
5689,BOOK VII,
5690,BOOK VII,Meanwhile the black ship on to Scyros ran;
5691,BOOK VII,And those twain found before his palace-gate
5692,BOOK VII,"Achilles' son, now hurling dart and lance,"
5693,BOOK VII,Now in his chariot driving fleetfoot steeds.
5694,BOOK VII,Glad were they to behold him practising
5695,BOOK VII,"The deeds of war, albeit his heart was sad"
5696,BOOK VII,"For his slain sire, of whom had tidings come"
5697,BOOK VII,Ere this.  With reverent eyes of awe they went
5698,BOOK VII,"To meet him, for that goodly form and face"
5699,BOOK VII,Seemed even as very Achilles unto them.
5700,BOOK VII,"But he, or ever they had spoken, cried:"
5701,BOOK VII,"""All hail, ye strangers, unto this mine home"
5702,BOOK VII,"Say whence ye are, and who, and what the need"
5703,BOOK VII,"That hither brings you over barren seas."""
5704,BOOK VII,
5705,BOOK VII,"So spake he, and Odysseus answered him:"
5706,BOOK VII,"""Friends are we of Achilles lord of war,"
5707,BOOK VII,To whom of Deidameia thou wast born--
5708,BOOK VII,"Yea, when we look on thee we seem to see"
5709,BOOK VII,That Hero's self; and like the Immortal Ones
5710,BOOK VII,Was he.  Of Ithaca am I: this man
5711,BOOK VII,"Of Argos, nurse of horses--if perchance"
5712,BOOK VII,Thou hast heard the name of Tydeus' warrior son
5713,BOOK VII,"Or of the wise Odysseus.  Lo, I stand"
5714,BOOK VII,"Before thee, sent by voice of prophecy."
5715,BOOK VII,"I pray thee, pity us: come thou to Troy"
5716,BOOK VII,And help us.  Only so unto the war
5717,BOOK VII,An end shall be.  Gifts beyond words to thee
5718,BOOK VII,"The Achaean kings shall give: yea, I myself"
5719,BOOK VII,"Will give to thee thy godlike father's arms,"
5720,BOOK VII,And great shall be thy joy in bearing them;
5721,BOOK VII,"For these be like no mortal's battle-gear,"
5722,BOOK VII,But splendid as the very War-god's arms.
5723,BOOK VII,Over their marvellous blazonry hath gold
5724,BOOK VII,"Been lavished; yea, in heaven Hephaestus' self"
5725,BOOK VII,"Rejoiced in fashioning that work divine,"
5726,BOOK VII,The which thine eyes shall marvel to behold;
5727,BOOK VII,For earth and heaven and sea upon the shield
5728,BOOK VII,"Are wrought, and in its wondrous compass are"
5729,BOOK VII,Creatures that seem to live and move--a wonder
5730,BOOK VII,Even to the Immortals.  Never man
5731,BOOK VII,"Hath seen their like, nor any man hath worn,"
5732,BOOK VII,"Save thy sire only, whom the Achaeans all"
5733,BOOK VII,Honoured as Zeus himself.  I chiefliest
5734,BOOK VII,"From mine heart loved him, and when he was slain,"
5735,BOOK VII,"To many a foe I dealt a ruthless doom,"
5736,BOOK VII,And through them all bare back to the ships his corse.
5737,BOOK VII,Therefore his glorious arms did Thetis give
5738,BOOK VII,"To me.  These, though I prize them well, to thee"
5739,BOOK VII,Will I give gladly when thou com'st to Troy.
5740,BOOK VII,"Yea also, when we have smitten Priam's towns"
5741,BOOK VII,"And unto Hellas in our ships return,"
5742,BOOK VII,"Shall Menelaus give thee, an thou wilt,"
5743,BOOK VII,"His princess-child to wife, of love for thee,"
5744,BOOK VII,And with his bright-haired daughter shall bestow
5745,BOOK VII,"Rich dower of gold and treasure, even all"
5746,BOOK VII,"That meet is to attend a wealthy king."""
5747,BOOK VII,
5748,BOOK VII,"So spake he, and replied Achilles' son:"
5749,BOOK VII,"""If bidden of oracles the Achaean men"
5750,BOOK VII,"Summon me, let us with to-morrow's dawn"
5751,BOOK VII,"Fare forth upon the broad depths of the sea,"
5752,BOOK VII,If so to longing Danaans I may prove
5753,BOOK VII,"A light of help.  Now pass we to mine halls,"
5754,BOOK VII,And to such guest-fare as befits to set
5755,BOOK VII,Before the stranger.  For my marriage-day--
5756,BOOK VII,"To this the Gods in time to come shall see."""
5757,BOOK VII,
5758,BOOK VII,"Then hall-ward led he them, and with glad hearts"
5759,BOOK VII,They followed.  To the forecourt when they came
5760,BOOK VII,"Of that great mansion, found they there the Queen"
5761,BOOK VII,Deidameia in her sorrow of soul
5762,BOOK VII,"Grief-wasted, as when snow from mountain-sides"
5763,BOOK VII,Before the sun and east-wind wastes away;
5764,BOOK VII,So pined she for that princely hero slain.
5765,BOOK VII,"Then came to her amidst her grief the kings,"
5766,BOOK VII,And greeted her in courteous wise.  Her son
5767,BOOK VII,Drew near and told their lineage and their names;
5768,BOOK VII,But that for which they came he left untold
5769,BOOK VII,"Until the morrow, lest unto her woe"
5770,BOOK VII,"There should be added grief and floods of tears,"
5771,BOOK VII,And lest her prayers should hold him from the path
5772,BOOK VII,"Whereon his heart was set.  Straight feasted these,"
5773,BOOK VII,"And comforted their hearts with sleep, even all"
5774,BOOK VII,"Which dwelt in sea-ringed Scyros, nightlong lulled"
5775,BOOK VII,"By long low thunder of the girdling deep,"
5776,BOOK VII,Of waves Aegean breaking on her shores.
5777,BOOK VII,But not on Deidameia fell the hands
5778,BOOK VII,Of kindly sleep.  She bore in mind the names
5779,BOOK VII,Of crafty Odysseus and of Diomede
5780,BOOK VII,"The godlike, how these twain had widowed her"
5781,BOOK VII,"Of battle-fain Achilles, how their words"
5782,BOOK VII,Had won his aweless heart to fare with them
5783,BOOK VII,"To meet the war-cry where stern Fate met him,"
5784,BOOK VII,"Shattered his hope of home-return, and laid"
5785,BOOK VII,Measureless grief on Peleus and on her.
5786,BOOK VII,Therefore an awful dread oppressed her soul
5787,BOOK VII,Lest her son too to tumult of the war
5788,BOOK VII,"Should speed, and grief be added to her grief."
5789,BOOK VII,
5790,BOOK VII,"Dawn climbed the wide-arched heaven, straightway they"
5791,BOOK VII,Rose from their beds.  Then Deidameia knew;
5792,BOOK VII,"And on her son's broad breast she cast herself,"
5793,BOOK VII,"And bitterly wailed: her cry thrilled through the air,"
5794,BOOK VII,As when a cow loud-lowing mid the hills
5795,BOOK VII,"Seeks through the glens her calf, and all around"
5796,BOOK VII,Echo long ridges of the mountain-steep;
5797,BOOK VII,So on all sides from dim recesses rang
5798,BOOK VII,The hall; and in her misery she cried:
5799,BOOK VII,"""Child, wherefore is thy soul now on the wing"
5800,BOOK VII,To follow strangers unto Ilium
5801,BOOK VII,"The fount of tears, where perish many in fight,"
5802,BOOK VII,"Yea, cunning men in war and battle grim?"
5803,BOOK VII,"And thou art but a youth, and hast not learnt"
5804,BOOK VII,"The ways of war, which save men in the day"
5805,BOOK VII,"Of peril.  Hearken thou to me, abide"
5806,BOOK VII,"Here in thine home, lest evil tidings come"
5807,BOOK VII,"From Troy unto my ears, that thou in fight"
5808,BOOK VII,"Hast perished; for mine heart saith, never thou"
5809,BOOK VII,Hitherward shalt from battle-toil return.
5810,BOOK VII,Not even thy sire escaped the doom of death--
5811,BOOK VII,"He, mightier than thou, mightier than all"
5812,BOOK VII,"Heroes on earth, yea, and a Goddess' son--"
5813,BOOK VII,"But was in battle slain, all through the wiles"
5814,BOOK VII,And crafty counsels of these very men
5815,BOOK VII,Who now to woeful war be kindling thee.
5816,BOOK VII,Therefore mine heart is full of shuddering fear
5817,BOOK VII,"Lest, son, my lot should be to live bereaved"
5818,BOOK VII,"Of thee, and to endure dishonour and pain,"
5819,BOOK VII,For never heavier blow on woman falls
5820,BOOK VII,"Than when her lord hath perished, and her sons"
5821,BOOK VII,"Die also, and her house is left to her"
5822,BOOK VII,Desolate.  Straightway evil men remove
5823,BOOK VII,"Her landmarks, yea, and rob her of her all,"
5824,BOOK VII,Setting the right at naught.  There is no lot
5825,BOOK VII,More woeful and more helpless than is hers
5826,BOOK VII,"Who is left a widow in a desolate home."""
5827,BOOK VII,
5828,BOOK VII,Loud-wailing spake she; but her son replied:
5829,BOOK VII,"""Be of good cheer, my mother; put from thee"
5830,BOOK VII,Evil foreboding.  No man is in war
5831,BOOK VII,Beyond his destiny slain.  If my weird be
5832,BOOK VII,"To die in my country's cause, then let me die"
5833,BOOK VII,"When I have done deeds worthy of my sire."""
5834,BOOK VII,
5835,BOOK VII,"Then to his side old Lycomedes came,"
5836,BOOK VII,And to his battle-eager grandson spake:
5837,BOOK VII,"""O valiant-hearted son, so like thy sire,"
5838,BOOK VII,"I know thee strong and valorous; yet, O yet"
5839,BOOK VII,For thee I fear the bitter war; I fear
5840,BOOK VII,The terrible sea-surge.  Shipmen evermore
5841,BOOK VII,"Hang on destruction's brink.  Beware, my child,"
5842,BOOK VII,Perils of waters when thou sailest back
5843,BOOK VII,"From Troy or other shores, such as beset"
5844,BOOK VII,Full oftentimes the voyagers that ride
5845,BOOK VII,"The long sea-ridges, when the sun hath left"
5846,BOOK VII,"The Archer-star, and meets the misty Goat,"
5847,BOOK VII,"When the wild blasts drive on the lowering storm,"
5848,BOOK VII,Or when Orion to the darkling west
5849,BOOK VII,"Slopes, into Ocean's river sinking slow."
5850,BOOK VII,"Beware the time of equal days and nights,"
5851,BOOK VII,"When blasts that o'er the sea's abysses rush,"
5852,BOOK VII,None knoweth whence in fury of battle clash.
5853,BOOK VII,"Beware the Pleiads' setting, when the sea"
5854,BOOK VII,"Maddens beneath their power nor these alone,"
5855,BOOK VII,"But other stars, terrors of hapless men,"
5856,BOOK VII,"As o'er the wide sea-gulf they set or rise."""
5857,BOOK VII,
5858,BOOK VII,"Then kissed he him, nor sought to stay the feet"
5859,BOOK VII,"Of him who panted for the clamour of war,"
5860,BOOK VII,Who smiled for pleasure and for eagerness
5861,BOOK VII,To haste to the ship.  Yet were his hurrying feet
5862,BOOK VII,Stayed by his mother's pleading and her tears
5863,BOOK VII,Still in those halls awhile.  As some swift horse
5864,BOOK VII,"Is reined in by his rider, when he strains"
5865,BOOK VII,"Unto the race-course, and he neighs, and champs"
5866,BOOK VII,"The curbing bit, dashing his chest with foam,"
5867,BOOK VII,And his feet eager for the course are still
5868,BOOK VII,"Never, his restless hooves are clattering aye;"
5869,BOOK VII,"His mane is a stormy cloud, he tosses high"
5870,BOOK VII,"His head with snortings, and his lord is glad;"
5871,BOOK VII,So reined his mother back the glorious son
5872,BOOK VII,"Of battle-stay Achilles, so his feet"
5873,BOOK VII,"Were restless, so the mother's loving pride"
5874,BOOK VII,"Joyed in her son, despite her heart-sick pain."
5875,BOOK VII,
5876,BOOK VII,"A thousand times he kissed her, then at last"
5877,BOOK VII,Left her alone with her own grief and moan
5878,BOOK VII,There in her father's halls.  As o'er her nest
5879,BOOK VII,A swallow in her anguish cries aloud
5880,BOOK VII,"For her lost nestlings which, mid piteous shrieks,"
5881,BOOK VII,"A fearful serpent hath devoured, and wrung"
5882,BOOK VII,The loving mother's heart; and now above
5883,BOOK VII,"That empty cradle spreads her wings, and now"
5884,BOOK VII,Flies round its porchway fashioned cunningly
5885,BOOK VII,Lamenting piteously her little ones:
5886,BOOK VII,So for her child Deidameia mourned.
5887,BOOK VII,"Now on her son's bed did she cast herself,"
5888,BOOK VII,"Crying aloud, against his door-post now"
5889,BOOK VII,"She leaned, and wept: now laid she in her lap"
5890,BOOK VII,"Those childhood's toys yet treasured in her bower,"
5891,BOOK VII,Wherein his babe-heart joyed long years agone.
5892,BOOK VII,"She saw a dart there left behind of him,"
5893,BOOK VII,"And kissed it o'er and o'er yea, whatso else"
5894,BOOK VII,Her weeping eyes beheld that was her son's.
5895,BOOK VII,
5896,BOOK VII,"Naught heard he of her moans unutterable,"
5897,BOOK VII,"But was afar, fast striding to the ship."
5898,BOOK VII,"He seemed, as his feet swiftly bare him on,"
5899,BOOK VII,Like some all-radiant star; and at his side
5900,BOOK VII,"With Tydeus' son war-wise Odysseus went,"
5901,BOOK VII,"And with them twenty gallant-hearted men,"
5902,BOOK VII,Whom Deidameia chose as trustiest
5903,BOOK VII,"Of all her household, and unto her son"
5904,BOOK VII,Gave them for henchmen swift to do his will.
5905,BOOK VII,"And these attended Achilles' valiant son,"
5906,BOOK VII,As through the city to the ship he sped.
5907,BOOK VII,"On, with glad laughter, in their midst he strode;"
5908,BOOK VII,And Thetis and the Nereids joyed thereat.
5909,BOOK VII,"Yea, glad was even the Raven-haired, the Lord"
5910,BOOK VII,"Of all the sea, beholding that brave son"
5911,BOOK VII,"Of princely Achilles, marking how he longed"
5912,BOOK VII,"For battle.  Beardless boy albeit he was,"
5913,BOOK VII,His prowess and his might were inward spurs
5914,BOOK VII,To him.  He hasted forth his fatherland
5915,BOOK VII,"Like to the War-god, when to gory strife"
5916,BOOK VII,"He speedeth, wroth with foes, when maddeneth"
5917,BOOK VII,"His heart, and grim his frown is, and his eyes"
5918,BOOK VII,"Flash levin-flame around him, and his face"
5919,BOOK VII,"Is clothed with glory of beauty terror-blent,"
5920,BOOK VII,As on he rusheth: quail the very Gods.
5921,BOOK VII,So seemed Achilles' goodly son; and prayers
5922,BOOK VII,Went up through all the city unto Heaven
5923,BOOK VII,To bring their noble prince safe back from war;
5924,BOOK VII,And the Gods hearkened to them.  High he towered
5925,BOOK VII,Above all stateliest men which followed him.
5926,BOOK VII,
5927,BOOK VII,"So came they to the heavy-plunging sea,"
5928,BOOK VII,And found the rowers in the smooth-wrought ship
5929,BOOK VII,"Handling the tackle, fixing mast and sail."
5930,BOOK VII,Straightway they went aboard: the shipmen cast
5931,BOOK VII,"The hawsers loose, and heaved the anchor-stones,"
5932,BOOK VII,The strength and stay of ships in time of need.
5933,BOOK VII,Then did the Sea-queen's lord grant voyage fair
5934,BOOK VII,To these with gracious mind; for his heart yearned
5935,BOOK VII,"O'er the Achaeans, by the Trojan men"
5936,BOOK VII,And mighty-souled Eurypylus hard-bestead.
5937,BOOK VII,On either side of Neoptolemus sat
5938,BOOK VII,"Those heroes, gladdening his soul with tales"
5939,BOOK VII,Of his sire's mighty deeds--of all he wrought
5940,BOOK VII,"In sea-raids, and in valiant Telephus' land,"
5941,BOOK VII,And how he smote round Priam's burg the men
5942,BOOK VII,"Of Troy, for glory unto Atreus' sons."
5943,BOOK VII,"His heart glowed, fain to grasp his heritage,"
5944,BOOK VII,His aweless father's honour and renown.
5945,BOOK VII,
5946,BOOK VII,"In her bower, sorrowing for her son the while,"
5947,BOOK VII,Deidameia poured forth sighs and tears.
5948,BOOK VII,With agony of soul her very heart
5949,BOOK VII,"Melted in her, as over coals doth lead"
5950,BOOK VII,"Or wax, and never did her moaning cease,"
5951,BOOK VII,As o'er the wide sea her gaze followed him.
5952,BOOK VII,"Ay, for her son a mother fretteth still,"
5953,BOOK VII,"Though it be to a feast that he hath gone,"
5954,BOOK VII,By a friend bidden forth.  But soon the sail
5955,BOOK VII,Of that good ship far-fleeting o'er the blue
5956,BOOK VII,Grew faint and fainter--melted in sea-haze.
5957,BOOK VII,"But still she sighed, still daylong made her moan."
5958,BOOK VII,
5959,BOOK VII,"On ran the ship before a following wind,"
5960,BOOK VII,"Seeming to skim the myriad-surging sea,"
5961,BOOK VII,And crashed the dark wave either side the prow:
5962,BOOK VII,Swiftly across the abyss unplumbed she sped.
5963,BOOK VII,"Night's darkness fell about her, but the breeze"
5964,BOOK VII,"Held, and the steersman's hand was sure.  O'er gulfs"
5965,BOOK VII,"Of brine she flew, till Dawn divine rose up"
5966,BOOK VII,To climb the sky.  Then sighted they the peaks
5967,BOOK VII,"Of Ida, Chrysa next, and Smintheus' fane,"
5968,BOOK VII,"Then the Sigean strand, and then the tomb"
5969,BOOK VII,"Of Aeacus' son.  Yet would Laertes' seed,"
5970,BOOK VII,"The man discreet of soul, not point it out"
5971,BOOK VII,"To Neoptolemus, lest the tide of grief"
5972,BOOK VII,Too high should swell within his breast.  They passed
5973,BOOK VII,"Calydnae's isles, left Tenedos behind;"
5974,BOOK VII,"And now was seen the fane of Eleus,"
5975,BOOK VII,"Where stands Protesilaus' tomb, beneath"
5976,BOOK VII,"The shade of towery elms; when, soaring high"
5977,BOOK VII,"Above the plain, their topmost boughs discern"
5978,BOOK VII,"Troy, straightway wither all their highest sprays."
5979,BOOK VII,Nigh Ilium now the ship by wind and oar
5980,BOOK VII,Was brought: they saw the long strand fringed with keels
5981,BOOK VII,"Of Argives, who endured sore travail of war"
5982,BOOK VII,"Even then about the wall, the which themselves"
5983,BOOK VII,Had reared to screen the ships and men in stress
5984,BOOK VII,Of battle.  Even now Eurypylus' hands
5985,BOOK VII,To earth were like to dash it and destroy;
5986,BOOK VII,But the quick eyes of Tydeus' strong son marked
5987,BOOK VII,How rained the darts and stones on that long wall.
5988,BOOK VII,"Forth of the ship he sprang, and shouted loud"
5989,BOOK VII,With all the strength of his undaunted breast:
5990,BOOK VII,"""Friends, on the Argive men is heaped this day"
5991,BOOK VII,Sore travail!  Let us don our flashing arms
5992,BOOK VII,"With speed, and to yon battle-turmoil haste."
5993,BOOK VII,For now upon our towers the warrior sons
5994,BOOK VII,"Of Troy press hard--yea, haply will they tear"
5995,BOOK VII,"The long walls down, and burn the ships with fire,"
5996,BOOK VII,And so the souls that long for home-return
5997,BOOK VII,"Shall win it never; nay, ourselves shall fall"
5998,BOOK VII,"Before our due time, and shall lie in graves"
5999,BOOK VII,"In Troyland, far from children and from wives."""
6000,BOOK VII,
6001,BOOK VII,All as one man down from the ship they leapt;
6002,BOOK VII,For trembling seized on all for that grim sight--
6003,BOOK VII,On all save aweless Neoptolemus
6004,BOOK VII,Whose might was like his father's: lust of war
6005,BOOK VII,Swept o'er him.  To Odysseus' tent in haste
6006,BOOK VII,"They sped, for close it lay to where the ship"
6007,BOOK VII,Touched land.  About its walls was hung great store
6008,BOOK VII,"Of change of armour, of wise Odysseus some,"
6009,BOOK VII,And rescued some from gallant comrades slain.
6010,BOOK VII,Then did the brave man put on goodly arms;
6011,BOOK VII,But they in whose breasts faintlier beat their hearts
6012,BOOK VII,Must don the worser.  Odysseus stood arrayed
6013,BOOK VII,In those which came with him from Ithaca:
6014,BOOK VII,To Diomede he gave fair battle-gear
6015,BOOK VII,Stripped in time past from mighty Socus slain.
6016,BOOK VII,But in his father's arms Achilles' son
6017,BOOK VII,"Clad him and lo, he seemed Achilles' self!"
6018,BOOK VII,Light on his limbs and lapping close they lay--
6019,BOOK VII,So cunning was Hephaestus' workmanship--
6020,BOOK VII,Which for another had been a giant's arms.
6021,BOOK VII,The massive helmet cumbered not his brows;
6022,BOOK VII,"Yea, the great Pelian spear-shaft burdened not"
6023,BOOK VII,"His hand, but lightly swung he up on high"
6024,BOOK VII,The heavy and tall lance thirsting still for blood.
6025,BOOK VII,
6026,BOOK VII,Of many Argives which beheld him then
6027,BOOK VII,"Might none draw nigh to him, how fain soe'er,"
6028,BOOK VII,So fast were they in that grim grapple locked
6029,BOOK VII,Of the wild war that raged all down the wall.
6030,BOOK VII,"But as when shipmen, under a desolate isle"
6031,BOOK VII,"Mid the wide sea by stress of weather bound,"
6032,BOOK VII,"Chafe, while afar from men the adverse blasts"
6033,BOOK VII,Prison them many a day; they pace the deck
6034,BOOK VII,"With sinking hearts, while scantier grows their store"
6035,BOOK VII,Of food; they weary till a fair wind sings;
6036,BOOK VII,"So joyed the Achaean host, which theretofore"
6037,BOOK VII,"Were heavy of heart, when Neoptolemus came,"
6038,BOOK VII,Joyed in the hope of breathing-space from toil.
6039,BOOK VII,"Then like the aweless lion's flashed his eyes,"
6040,BOOK VII,Which mid the mountains leaps in furious mood
6041,BOOK VII,"To meet the hunters that draw nigh his cave,"
6042,BOOK VII,"Thinking to steal his cubs, there left alone"
6043,BOOK VII,In a dark-shadowed glen but from a height
6044,BOOK VII,"The beast hath spied, and on the spoilers leaps"
6045,BOOK VII,With grim jaws terribly roaring; even so
6046,BOOK VII,That glorious child of Aeacus' aweless son
6047,BOOK VII,Against the Trojan warriors burned in wrath.
6048,BOOK VII,Thither his eagle-swoop descended first
6049,BOOK VII,"Where loudest from the plain uproared the fight,"
6050,BOOK VII,"There weakest, he divined, must be the wall,"
6051,BOOK VII,"The battlements lowest, since the surge of foes"
6052,BOOK VII,Brake heaviest there.  Charged at his side the rest
6053,BOOK VII,Breathing the battle-spirit.  There they found
6054,BOOK VII,Eurypylus mighty of heart and all his men
6055,BOOK VII,"Scaling a tower, exultant in the hope"
6056,BOOK VII,"Of tearing down the walls, of slaughtering"
6057,BOOK VII,The Argives in one holocaust.  No mind
6058,BOOK VII,The Gods had to accomplish their desire!
6059,BOOK VII,"But now Odysseus, Diomede the strong,"
6060,BOOK VII,"Leonteus, and Neoptolemus, as a God"
6061,BOOK VII,"In strength and beauty, hailed their javelins down,"
6062,BOOK VII,And thrust them from the wall.  As dogs and shepherds
6063,BOOK VII,By shouting and hard fighting drive away
6064,BOOK VII,"Strong lions from a steading, rushing forth"
6065,BOOK VII,"From all sides, and the brutes with glaring eyes"
6066,BOOK VII,Pace to and fro; with savage lust for blood
6067,BOOK VII,Of calves and kine their jaws are slavering;
6068,BOOK VII,Yet must their onrush give back from the hounds
6069,BOOK VII,And fearless onset of the shepherd folk;
6070,BOOK VII,[So from these new defenders shrank the foe]
6071,BOOK VII,"A little, far as one may hurl a stone"
6072,BOOK VII,Exceeding great; for still Eurypylus
6073,BOOK VII,"Suffered them not to flee far from the ships,"
6074,BOOK VII,"But cheered them on to bide the brunt, until"
6075,BOOK VII,"The ships be won, and all the Argives slain;"
6076,BOOK VII,For Zeus with measureless might thrilled all his frame.
6077,BOOK VII,"Then seized he a rugged stone and huge, and leapt"
6078,BOOK VII,And hurled it full against the high-built wall.
6079,BOOK VII,"It crashed, and terribly boomed that rampart steep"
6080,BOOK VII,"To its foundations.  Terror gripped the Greeks,"
6081,BOOK VII,As though that wall had crumbled down in dust;
6082,BOOK VII,"Yet from the deadly conflict flinched they not,"
6083,BOOK VII,"But stood fast, like to jackals or to wolves"
6084,BOOK VII,Bold robbers of the sheep--when mid the hills
6085,BOOK VII,"Hunter and hound would drive them forth their caves,"
6086,BOOK VII,Being grimly purposed there to slay their whelps.
6087,BOOK VII,"Yet these, albeit tormented by the darts,"
6088,BOOK VII,"Flee not, but for their cubs' sake bide and fight;"
6089,BOOK VII,"So for the ships' sake they abode and fought,"
6090,BOOK VII,And for their own lives.  But Eurypylus
6091,BOOK VII,"Afront of all the ships stood, taunting them:"
6092,BOOK VII,"""Coward and dastard souls!  no darts of yours"
6093,BOOK VII,"Had given me pause, nor thrust back from your ships,"
6094,BOOK VII,Had not your rampart stayed mine onset-rush.
6095,BOOK VII,"Ye are like to dogs, that in a forest flinch"
6096,BOOK VII,Before a lion!  Skulking therewithin
6097,BOOK VII,"Ye are fighting--nay, are shrinking back from death!"
6098,BOOK VII,"But if ye dare come forth on Trojan ground,"
6099,BOOK VII,"As once when ye were eager for the fray,"
6100,BOOK VII,None shall from ghastly death deliver you:
6101,BOOK VII,"Slain by mine hand ye all shall lie in dust!"""
6102,BOOK VII,
6103,BOOK VII,"So did he shout a prophecy unfulfilled,"
6104,BOOK VII,Nor heard Doom's chariot-wheels fast rolling near
6105,BOOK VII,"Bearing swift death at Neoptolemus' hands,"
6106,BOOK VII,Nor saw death gleaming from his glittering spear.
6107,BOOK VII,"Ay, and that hero paused not now from fight,"
6108,BOOK VII,But from the ramparts smote the Trojans aye.
6109,BOOK VII,From that death leaping from above they quailed
6110,BOOK VII,In tumult round Eurypylus: deadly fear
6111,BOOK VII,Gripped all their hearts.  As little children cower
6112,BOOK VII,About a father's knees when thunder of Zeus
6113,BOOK VII,"Crashes from cloud to cloud, when all the air"
6114,BOOK VII,"Shudders and groans, so did the sons of Troy,"
6115,BOOK VII,"With those Ceteians round their great king, cower"
6116,BOOK VII,Ever as prince Neoptolemus hurled; for death
6117,BOOK VII,"Rode upon all he cast, and bare his wrath"
6118,BOOK VII,Straight rushing down upon the heads of foes.
6119,BOOK VII,Now in their hearts those wildered Trojans said
6120,BOOK VII,That once more they beheld Achilles' self
6121,BOOK VII,Gigantic in his armour.  Yet they hid
6122,BOOK VII,"That horror in their breasts, lest panic fear"
6123,BOOK VII,Should pass from them to the Ceteian host
6124,BOOK VII,And king Eurypylus; so on every side
6125,BOOK VII,They wavered 'twixt the stress of their hard strait
6126,BOOK VII,"And that blood-curdling dread, 'twixt shame and fear."
6127,BOOK VII,As when men treading a precipitous path
6128,BOOK VII,"Look up, and see adown the mountain-slope"
6129,BOOK VII,"A torrent rushing on them, thundering down"
6130,BOOK VII,"The rocks, and dare not meet its clamorous flood,"
6131,BOOK VII,"But hurry shuddering on, with death in sight"
6132,BOOK VII,Holding as naught the perils of the path;
6133,BOOK VII,"So stayed the Trojans, spite of their desire"
6134,BOOK VII,[To flee the imminent death that waited them]
6135,BOOK VII,Beneath the wall.  Godlike Eurypylus
6136,BOOK VII,Aye cheered them on to fight.  He trusted still
6137,BOOK VII,That this new mighty foe would weary at last
6138,BOOK VII,With toil of slaughter; but he wearied not.
6139,BOOK VII,
6140,BOOK VII,"That desperate battle-travail Pallas saw,"
6141,BOOK VII,"And left the halls of Heaven incense-sweet,"
6142,BOOK VII,And flew o'er mountain-crests: her hurrying feet
6143,BOOK VII,"Touched not the earth, borne by the air divine"
6144,BOOK VII,"In form of cloud-wreaths, swifter than the wind."
6145,BOOK VII,"She came to Troy, she stayed her feet upon"
6146,BOOK VII,"Sigeum's windy ness, she looked forth thence"
6147,BOOK VII,"Over the ringing battle of dauntless men,"
6148,BOOK VII,And gave the Achaeans glory.  Achilles' son
6149,BOOK VII,Beyond the rest was filled with valour and strength
6150,BOOK VII,Which win renown for men in whom they meet.
6151,BOOK VII,Peerless was he in both: the blood of Zeus
6152,BOOK VII,Gave strength; to his father's valour was he heir;
6153,BOOK VII,So by those towers he smote down many a foe.
6154,BOOK VII,"And as a fisher on the darkling sea,"
6155,BOOK VII,"To lure the fish to their destruction, takes"
6156,BOOK VII,Within his boat the strength of fire; his breath
6157,BOOK VII,"Kindles it to a flame, till round the boat"
6158,BOOK VII,"Glareth its splendour, and from the black sea"
6159,BOOK VII,Dart up the fish all eager to behold
6160,BOOK VII,The radiance--for the last time; for the barbs
6161,BOOK VII,"Of his three-pointed spear, as up they leap,"
6162,BOOK VII,Slay them; his heart rejoices o'er the prey.
6163,BOOK VII,So that war-king Achilles' glorious son
6164,BOOK VII,Slew hosts of onward-rushing foes around
6165,BOOK VII,"That wall of stone.  Well fought the Achaeans all,"
6166,BOOK VII,"Here, there, adown the ramparts: rang again"
6167,BOOK VII,The wide strand and the ships: the battered walls
6168,BOOK VII,Groaned ever.  Men with weary ache of toil
6169,BOOK VII,Fainted on either side; sinews and might
6170,BOOK VII,Of strong men were unstrung.  But o'er the son
6171,BOOK VII,Of battle-stay Achilles weariness
6172,BOOK VII,Crept not: his battle-eager spirit aye
6173,BOOK VII,Was tireless; never touched by palsying fear
6174,BOOK VII,"He fought on, as with the triumphant strength"
6175,BOOK VII,Of an ever-flowing river: though it roll
6176,BOOK VII,"'Twixt blazing forests, though the madding blast"
6177,BOOK VII,"Roll stormy seas of flame, it feareth not,"
6178,BOOK VII,"For at its brink faint grows the fervent heat,"
6179,BOOK VII,The strong flood turns its might to impotence;
6180,BOOK VII,So weariness nor fear could bow the knees
6181,BOOK VII,"Of Hero Achilles' gallant-hearted son,"
6182,BOOK VII,"Still as he fought, still cheered his comrades on."
6183,BOOK VII,Of myriad shafts sped at him none might touch
6184,BOOK VII,"His flesh, but even as snowflakes on a rock"
6185,BOOK VII,Fell vainly ever: wholly screened was he
6186,BOOK VII,"By broad shield and strong helmet, gifts of a God."
6187,BOOK VII,In these exulting did the Aeacid's son
6188,BOOK VII,"Stride all along the wall, with ringing shouts"
6189,BOOK VII,"Cheering the dauntless Argives to the fray,"
6190,BOOK VII,"Being their mightiest far, bearing a soul"
6191,BOOK VII,"Insatiate of the awful onset-cry,"
6192,BOOK VII,"Burning with one strong purpose, to avenge"
6193,BOOK VII,His father's death: the Myrmidons in their king
6194,BOOK VII,Exulted.  Roared the battle round the wall.
6195,BOOK VII,
6196,BOOK VII,"Two sons he slew of Meges rich in gold,"
6197,BOOK VII,"Scion of Dymas--sons of high renown,"
6198,BOOK VII,"Cunning to hurl the dart, to drive the steed"
6199,BOOK VII,"In war, and deftly cast the lance afar,"
6200,BOOK VII,Born at one birth beside Sangarius' banks
6201,BOOK VII,"Of Periboea to him, Celtus one,"
6202,BOOK VII,And Eubius the other.  But not long
6203,BOOK VII,"His boundless wealth enjoyed they, for the"
6204,BOOK VII,Fates Span them a thread of life exceeding brief.
6205,BOOK VII,"As on one day they saw the light, they died"
6206,BOOK VII,On one day by the same hand.  To the heart
6207,BOOK VII,Of one Neoptolemus sped a javelin; one
6208,BOOK VII,He smote down with a massy stone that crashed
6209,BOOK VII,"Through his strong helmet, shattered all its ridge,"
6210,BOOK VII,And dashed his brains to earth.  Around them fell
6211,BOOK VII,"Foes many, a host untold.  The War-god's work"
6212,BOOK VII,"Waxed ever mightier till the eventide,"
6213,BOOK VII,Till failed the light celestial; then the host
6214,BOOK VII,Of brave Eurypylus from the ships drew back
6215,BOOK VII,A little: they that held those leaguered towers
6216,BOOK VII,Had a short breathing-space; the sons of Troy
6217,BOOK VII,"Had respite from the deadly-echoing strife,"
6218,BOOK VII,From that hard rampart-battle.  Verily all
6219,BOOK VII,"The Argives had beside their ships been slain,"
6220,BOOK VII,Had not Achilles' strong son on that day
6221,BOOK VII,Withstood the host of foes and their great chief
6222,BOOK VII,Eurypylus.  Came to that young hero's side
6223,BOOK VII,"Phoenix the old, and marvelling gazed on one"
6224,BOOK VII,The image of Peleides.  Tides of joy
6225,BOOK VII,"And grief swept o'er him--grief, for memories"
6226,BOOK VII,"Of that swift-footed father--joy, for sight"
6227,BOOK VII,Of such a son.  He for sheer gladness wept;
6228,BOOK VII,For never without tears the tribes of men
6229,BOOK VII,"Live--nay, not mid the transports of delight."
6230,BOOK VII,He clasped him round as father claspeth son
6231,BOOK VII,"Whom, after long and troublous wanderings,"
6232,BOOK VII,The Gods bring home to gladden a father's heart.
6233,BOOK VII,"So kissed he Neoptolemus' head and breast,"
6234,BOOK VII,"Clasping him round, and cried in rapture of joy:"
6235,BOOK VII,"""Hail, goodly son of that Achilles whom"
6236,BOOK VII,I nursed a little one in mine own arms
6237,BOOK VII,With a glad heart.  By Heaven's high providence
6238,BOOK VII,"Like a strong sapling waxed he in stature fast,"
6239,BOOK VII,And daily I rejoiced to see his form
6240,BOOK VII,"And prowess, my life's blessing, honouring him"
6241,BOOK VII,As though he were the son of mine old age;
6242,BOOK VII,For like a father did he honour me.
6243,BOOK VII,"I was indeed his father, he my son"
6244,BOOK VII,In spirit: thou hadst deemed us of one blood
6245,BOOK VII,Who were in heart one: but of nobler mould
6246,BOOK VII,"Was he by far, in form and strength a God."
6247,BOOK VII,"Thou art wholly like him--yea, I seem to see"
6248,BOOK VII,Alive amid the Argives him for whom
6249,BOOK VII,Sharp anguish shrouds me ever.  I waste away
6250,BOOK VII,In sorrowful age--oh that the grave had closed
6251,BOOK VII,On me while yet he lived!  How blest to be
6252,BOOK VII,By loving hands of kinsmen laid to rest!
6253,BOOK VII,"Ah child, my sorrowing heart will nevermore"
6254,BOOK VII,Forget him!  Chide me not for this my grief.
6255,BOOK VII,"But now, help thou the Myrmidons and Greeks"
6256,BOOK VII,In their sore strait: wreak on the foe thy wrath
6257,BOOK VII,For thy brave sire.  It shall be thy renown
6258,BOOK VII,To slay this war-insatiate Telephus' son;
6259,BOOK VII,"For mightier art thou, and shalt prove, than he,"
6260,BOOK VII,"As was thy father than his wretched sire."""
6261,BOOK VII,
6262,BOOK VII,Made answer golden-haired Achilles' son:
6263,BOOK VII,"""Ancient, our battle-prowess mighty Fate"
6264,BOOK VII,"And the o'ermastering War-god shall decide."""
6265,BOOK VII,
6266,BOOK VII,"But, as he spake, he had fain on that same day"
6267,BOOK VII,Forth of the gates have rushed in his sire's arms;
6268,BOOK VII,"But night, which bringeth men release from toil,"
6269,BOOK VII,Rose from the ocean veiled in sable pall.
6270,BOOK VII,
6271,BOOK VII,With honour as of mighty Achilles' self
6272,BOOK VII,"Him mid the ships the glad Greeks hailed, who had won"
6273,BOOK VII,Courage from that his eager rush to war.
6274,BOOK VII,"With princely presents did they honour him,"
6275,BOOK VII,"With priceless gifts, whereby is wealth increased;"
6276,BOOK VII,"For some gave gold and silver, handmaids some,"
6277,BOOK VII,"Brass without weight gave these, and iron those;"
6278,BOOK VII,Others in deep jars brought the ruddy wine:
6279,BOOK VII,"Yea, fleetfoot steeds they gave, and battle-gear,"
6280,BOOK VII,And raiment woven fair by women's hands.
6281,BOOK VII,Glowed Neoptolemus' heart for joy of these.
6282,BOOK VII,"A feast they made for him amidst the tents,"
6283,BOOK VII,And there extolled Achilles' godlike son
6284,BOOK VII,With praise as of the immortal Heavenly Ones;
6285,BOOK VII,And joyful-voiced Agamemnon spake to him:
6286,BOOK VII,"""Thou verily art the brave-souled Aeacid's son,"
6287,BOOK VII,"His very image thou in stalwart might,"
6288,BOOK VII,"In beauty, stature, courage, and in soul."
6289,BOOK VII,Mine heart burns in me seeing thee.  I trust
6290,BOOK VII,"Thine hands and spear shall smite yon hosts of foes,"
6291,BOOK VII,Shall smite the city of Priam world-renowned--
6292,BOOK VII,So like thy sire thou art!  Methinks I see
6293,BOOK VII,"Himself beside the ships, as when his shout"
6294,BOOK VII,Of wrath for dead Patroclus shook the ranks
6295,BOOK VII,"Of Troy.  But he is with the Immortal Ones,"
6296,BOOK VII,"Yet, bending from that heaven, sends thee to-day"
6297,BOOK VII,"To save the Argives on destruction's brink."""
6298,BOOK VII,
6299,BOOK VII,Answered Achilles' battle-eager son:
6300,BOOK VII,"""Would I might meet him living yet, O King,"
6301,BOOK VII,That so himself might see the son of his love
6302,BOOK VII,Not shaming his great father's name. I trust
6303,BOOK VII,"So shall it be, if the Gods grant me life."""
6304,BOOK VII,
6305,BOOK VII,So spake he in wisdom and in modesty;
6306,BOOK VII,And all there marvelled at the godlike man.
6307,BOOK VII,"But when with meat and wine their hearts were filled,"
6308,BOOK VII,"Then rose Achilles' battle-eager son,"
6309,BOOK VII,And from the feast passed forth unto the tent
6310,BOOK VII,That was his sire's.  Much armour of heroes slain
6311,BOOK VII,Lay there; and here and there were captive maids
6312,BOOK VII,"Arraying that tent widowed of its lord,"
6313,BOOK VII,As though its king lived.  When that son beheld
6314,BOOK VII,"Those Trojan arms and handmaid-thralls, he groaned,"
6315,BOOK VII,By passionate longing for his father seized.
6316,BOOK VII,As when through dense oak-groves and tangled glens
6317,BOOK VII,Comes to the shadowed cave a lion's whelp
6318,BOOK VII,"Whose grim sire by the hunters hath been slain,"
6319,BOOK VII,"And looketh all around that empty den,"
6320,BOOK VII,And seeth heaps of bones of steeds and kine
6321,BOOK VII,"Slain theretofore, and grieveth for his sire;"
6322,BOOK VII,Even so the heart of brave Peleides' son
6323,BOOK VII,With grief was numbed.  The handmaids marvelling gazed;
6324,BOOK VII,"And fair Briseis' self, when she beheld"
6325,BOOK VII,"Achilles' son, was now right glad at heart,"
6326,BOOK VII,And sorrowed now with memories of the dead.
6327,BOOK VII,"Her soul was wildered all, as though indeed"
6328,BOOK VII,There stood the aweless Aeacid living yet.
6329,BOOK VII,
6330,BOOK VII,Meanwhile exultant Trojans camped aloof
6331,BOOK VII,"Extolled Eurypylus the fierce and strong,"
6332,BOOK VII,"As erst they had praised Hector, when he smote"
6333,BOOK VII,"Their foes, defending Troy and all her wealth."
6334,BOOK VII,"But when sweet sleep stole over mortal men,"
6335,BOOK VII,Then sons of Troy and battle-biding Greeks
6336,BOOK VII,All slumber-heavy slept unsentinelled.
6337,BOOK VII,
6338,BOOK VII,
6339,BOOK VII,
6340,BOOK VIII,BOOK VIII
6341,BOOK VIII,
6342,BOOK VIII,How Hercules' Grandson perished in fight with the Son of Achilles.
6343,BOOK VIII,
6344,BOOK VIII,
6345,BOOK VIII,"When from the far sea-line, where is the cave"
6346,BOOK VIII,"Of Dawn, rose up the sun, and scattered light"
6347,BOOK VIII,"Over the earth, then did the eager sons"
6348,BOOK VIII,Of Troy and of Achaea arm themselves
6349,BOOK VIII,Athirst for battle: these Achilles' son
6350,BOOK VIII,Cheered on to face the Trojans awelessly;
6351,BOOK VIII,And those the giant strength of Telephus' seed
6352,BOOK VIII,Kindled.  He trusted to dash down the wall
6353,BOOK VIII,"To earth, and utterly destroy the ships"
6354,BOOK VIII,"With ravening fire, and slay the Argive host."
6355,BOOK VIII,"Ah, but his hope was as the morning breeze"
6356,BOOK VIII,Delusive: hard beside him stood the Fates
6357,BOOK VIII,Laughing to scorn his vain imaginings.
6358,BOOK VIII,
6359,BOOK VIII,"Then to the Myrmidons spake Achilles' son,"
6360,BOOK VIII,"The aweless, to the fight enkindling them:"
6361,BOOK VIII,"""Hear me, mine henchmen: take ye to your hearts"
6362,BOOK VIII,"The spirit of war, that we may heal the wounds"
6363,BOOK VIII,"Of Argos, and be ruin to her foes."
6364,BOOK VIII,"Let no man fear, for mighty prowess is"
6365,BOOK VIII,The child of courage; but fear slayeth strength
6366,BOOK VIII,And spirit.  Gird yourselves with strength for war;
6367,BOOK VIII,"Give foes no breathing-space, that they may say"
6368,BOOK VIII,"That mid our ranks Achilles liveth yet."""
6369,BOOK VIII,
6370,BOOK VIII,Then clad he with his father's flashing arms
6371,BOOK VIII,His shoulders.  Then exulted Thetis' heart
6372,BOOK VIII,When from the sea she saw the mighty strength
6373,BOOK VIII,Of her son's son.  Then forth with eagle-speed
6374,BOOK VIII,"Afront of that high wall he rushed, his ear"
6375,BOOK VIII,Drawn by the immortal horses of his sire.
6376,BOOK VIII,As from the ocean-verge upsprings the sun
6377,BOOK VIII,"In glory, flashing fire far over earth--"
6378,BOOK VIII,"Fire, when beside his radiant chariot-team"
6379,BOOK VIII,"Races the red star Sirius, scatterer"
6380,BOOK VIII,Of woefullest diseases over men;
6381,BOOK VIII,So flashed upon the eyes of Ilium's host
6382,BOOK VIII,"That battle-eager hero, Achilles' son."
6383,BOOK VIII,"Onward they whirled him, those immortal steeds,"
6384,BOOK VIII,"The which, when now he longed to chase the foe"
6385,BOOK VIII,"Back from the ships, Automedon, who wont"
6386,BOOK VIII,"To rein them for his father, brought to him."
6387,BOOK VIII,"With joy that pair bore battleward their lord,"
6388,BOOK VIII,"So like to Aeacus' son, their deathless hearts"
6389,BOOK VIII,Held him no worser than Achilles' self.
6390,BOOK VIII,Laughing for glee the Argives gathered round
6391,BOOK VIII,"The might resistless of Neoptolemus,"
6392,BOOK VIII,Eager for fight as wasps [whose woodland bower
6393,BOOK VIII,"The axe] hath shaken, who dart swarming forth"
6394,BOOK VIII,Furious to sting the woodman: round their nest
6395,BOOK VIII,"Long eddying, they torment all passers by;"
6396,BOOK VIII,So streamed they forth from galley and from wall
6397,BOOK VIII,"Burning for fight, and that wide space was thronged,"
6398,BOOK VIII,"And all the plain far blazed with armour-sheen,"
6399,BOOK VIII,As shone from heaven's vault the sun thereon.
6400,BOOK VIII,As flees the cloud-rack through the welkin wide
6401,BOOK VIII,"Scourged onward by the North-wind's Titan blasts,"
6402,BOOK VIII,"When winter-tide and snow are hard at hand,"
6403,BOOK VIII,And darkness overpalls the firmament;
6404,BOOK VIII,So with their thronging squadrons was the earth
6405,BOOK VIII,"Covered before the ships.  To heaven uprolled,"
6406,BOOK VIII,Dust hung on hovering wings' men's armour clashed;
6407,BOOK VIII,Rattled a thousand chariots; horses neighed
6408,BOOK VIII,On-rushing to the fray.  Each warrior's prowess
6409,BOOK VIII,Kindled him with its trumpet-call to war.
6410,BOOK VIII,
6411,BOOK VIII,"As leap the long sea-rollers, onward hurled"
6412,BOOK VIII,By two winds terribly o'er th' broad sea-flood
6413,BOOK VIII,"Roaring from viewless bournes, with whirlwind blasts"
6414,BOOK VIII,"Crashing together, when a ruining storm"
6415,BOOK VIII,"Maddens along the wide gulfs of the deep,"
6416,BOOK VIII,And moans the Sea-queen with her anguished waves
6417,BOOK VIII,"Which sweep from every hand, uptowering"
6418,BOOK VIII,"Like precipiced mountains, while the bitter squall,"
6419,BOOK VIII,"Ceaselessly veering, shrieks across the sea;"
6420,BOOK VIII,So clashed in strife those hosts from either hand
6421,BOOK VIII,"With mad rage.  Strife incarnate spurred them on,"
6422,BOOK VIII,And their own prowess.  Crashed together these
6423,BOOK VIII,"Like thunderclouds outlightening, thrilling the air."
6424,BOOK VIII,"With shattering trumpet-challenge, when the blasts"
6425,BOOK VIII,"Are locked in frenzied wrestle, with mad breath"
6426,BOOK VIII,"Rending the clouds, when Zeus is wroth with men"
6427,BOOK VIII,"Who travail with iniquity, and flout"
6428,BOOK VIII,"His law.  So grappled they, as spear with spear"
6429,BOOK VIII,"Clashed, shield with shield, and man on man was hurled."
6430,BOOK VIII,
6431,BOOK VIII,And first Achilles' war-impetuous son
6432,BOOK VIII,"Struck down stout Melaneus and Alcidamas,"
6433,BOOK VIII,"Sons of the war-lord Alexinomus,"
6434,BOOK VIII,"Who dwelt in Caunus mountain-cradled, nigh"
6435,BOOK VIII,The clear lake shining at Tarbelus' feet
6436,BOOK VIII,"'Neath snow-capt Imbrus.  Menes, fleetfoot son"
6437,BOOK VIII,"Of King Cassandrus, slew he, born to him"
6438,BOOK VIII,"By fair Creusa, where the lovely streams"
6439,BOOK VIII,"Of Lindus meet the sea, beside the marches"
6440,BOOK VIII,"Of battle-biding Carians, and the heights"
6441,BOOK VIII,Of Lycia the renowned.  He slew withal
6442,BOOK VIII,"Morys the spearman, who from Phrygia came;"
6443,BOOK VIII,Polybus and Hippomedon by his side
6444,BOOK VIII,"He laid, this stabbed to the heart, that pierced between"
6445,BOOK VIII,Shoulder and neck: man after man he slew.
6446,BOOK VIII,Earth groaned 'neath Trojan corpses; rank on rank
6447,BOOK VIII,"Crumbled before him, even as parched brakes"
6448,BOOK VIII,Sink down before the blast of ravening fire
6449,BOOK VIII,When the north wind of latter summer blows;
6450,BOOK VIII,So ruining squadrons fell before his charge.
6451,BOOK VIII,
6452,BOOK VIII,"Meanwhile Aeneas slew Aristolochus,"
6453,BOOK VIII,Crashing a great stone down on his head: it brake
6454,BOOK VIII,"Helmet and skull together, and fled his life."
6455,BOOK VIII,Fleetfoot Eumaeus Diomede slew; he dwelt
6456,BOOK VIII,"In craggy Dardanus, where the bride-bed is"
6457,BOOK VIII,Whereon Anchises clasped the Queen of Love.
6458,BOOK VIII,Agamemnon smote down Stratus: unto Thrace
6459,BOOK VIII,"Returned he not from war, but died far off"
6460,BOOK VIII,From his dear fatherland.  And Meriones
6461,BOOK VIII,"Struck Chlemus down, Peisenor's son, the friend"
6462,BOOK VIII,"Of god-like Glaucus, and his comrade leal,"
6463,BOOK VIII,Who by Limurus' outfall dwelt: the folk
6464,BOOK VIII,"Honoured him as their king, when reigned no more"
6465,BOOK VIII,"Glaucus, in battle slain,--all who abode"
6466,BOOK VIII,"Around Phoenice's towers, and by the crest"
6467,BOOK VIII,"Of Massicytus, and Chimaera's glen."
6468,BOOK VIII,
6469,BOOK VIII,So man slew man in fight; but more than all
6470,BOOK VIII,Eurypylus hurled doom on many a foe.
6471,BOOK VIII,"First slew he battle-bider Eurytus,"
6472,BOOK VIII,"Menoetius of the glancing taslet next,"
6473,BOOK VIII,Elephenor's godlike comrades.  Fell with these
6474,BOOK VIII,"Harpalus, wise Odysseus' warrior-friend;"
6475,BOOK VIII,"But in the fight afar that hero toiled,"
6476,BOOK VIII,And might not aid his fallen henchman: yet
6477,BOOK VIII,"Fierce Antiphus for that slain man was wroth,"
6478,BOOK VIII,"And hurled his spear against Eurypylus,"
6479,BOOK VIII,"Yet touched him not; the strong shaft glanced aside,"
6480,BOOK VIII,"And pierced Meilanion battle-staunch, the son"
6481,BOOK VIII,"Of Cleite lovely-faced, Erylaus' bride,"
6482,BOOK VIII,Who bare him where Caicus meets the sea.
6483,BOOK VIII,"Wroth for his comrade slain, Eurypylus"
6484,BOOK VIII,"Rushed upon Antiphus, but terror-winged"
6485,BOOK VIII,He plunged amid his comrades; so the spear
6486,BOOK VIII,"Of the avenger slew him not, whose doom"
6487,BOOK VIII,Was one day wretchedly to be devoured
6488,BOOK VIII,By the manslaying Cyclops: so it pleased
6489,BOOK VIII,"Stern Fate, I know not why.  Elsewhither sped"
6490,BOOK VIII,Eurypylus; and aye as he rushed on
6491,BOOK VIII,Fell 'neath his spear a multitude untold.
6492,BOOK VIII,"As tall trees, smitten by the strength of steel"
6493,BOOK VIII,"In mountain-forest, fill the dark ravines,"
6494,BOOK VIII,"Heaped on the earth confusedly, so fell"
6495,BOOK VIII,The Achaeans 'neath Eurypylus' flying spears--
6496,BOOK VIII,Till heart-uplifted met him face to face
6497,BOOK VIII,Achilles' son.  The long spears in their hands
6498,BOOK VIII,"They twain swung up, each hot to smite his foe."
6499,BOOK VIII,But first Eurypylus cried the challenge-cry;
6500,BOOK VIII,"""Who art thou?  Whence hast come to brave me here?"
6501,BOOK VIII,To Hades merciless Fate is bearing thee;
6502,BOOK VIII,For in grim fight hath none escaped mine hands;
6503,BOOK VIII,"But whoso, eager for the fray, have come"
6504,BOOK VIII,"Hither, on all have I hurled anguished death."
6505,BOOK VIII,By Xanthus' streams have dogs devoured their flesh
6506,BOOK VIII,"And gnawed their bones.  Answer me, who art thou?"
6507,BOOK VIII,"Whose be the steeds that bear thee exultant on?"""
6508,BOOK VIII,
6509,BOOK VIII,Answered Achilles' battle-eager son:
6510,BOOK VIII,"""Wherefore, when I am hurrying to the fray,"
6511,BOOK VIII,"Dost thou, a foe, put question thus to me,"
6512,BOOK VIII,"As might a friend, touching my lineage,"
6513,BOOK VIII,"Which many know?  Achilles' son am I,"
6514,BOOK VIII,"Son of the man whose long spear smote thy sire,"
6515,BOOK VIII,"And made him flee--yea, and the ruthless fates"
6516,BOOK VIII,"Of death had seized him, but my father's self"
6517,BOOK VIII,Healed him upon the brink of woeful death.
6518,BOOK VIII,The steeds which bear me were my godlike sire's;
6519,BOOK VIII,"These the West-wind begat, the Harpy bare:"
6520,BOOK VIII,Over the barren sea their feet can race
6521,BOOK VIII,Skimming its crests: in speed they match the winds.
6522,BOOK VIII,Since then thou know'st the lineage of my steeds
6523,BOOK VIII,"And mine, now put thou to the test the might"
6524,BOOK VIII,"Of my strong spear, born on steep Pelion's crest,"
6525,BOOK VIII,"Who hath left his father-stock and forest there."""
6526,BOOK VIII,
6527,BOOK VIII,He spake; and from the chariot sprang to earth
6528,BOOK VIII,That glorious man: he swung the long spear up.
6529,BOOK VIII,But in his brawny hand his foe hath seized
6530,BOOK VIII,A monstrous stone: full at the golden shield
6531,BOOK VIII,Of Neoptolemus he sped its flight;
6532,BOOK VIII,"But, no whir staggered by its whirlwind rush,"
6533,BOOK VIII,He like a giant mountain-foreland stood
6534,BOOK VIII,Which all the banded fury of river-floods
6535,BOOK VIII,"Can stir not, rooted in the eternal hills;"
6536,BOOK VIII,So stood unshaken still Achilles' son.
6537,BOOK VIII,Yet not for this Eurypylus' dauntless might
6538,BOOK VIII,"Shrank from Achilles' son invincible,"
6539,BOOK VIII,On-spurred by his own hardihood and by Fate.
6540,BOOK VIII,"Their hearts like caldrons seethed o'er fires of wrath,"
6541,BOOK VIII,Their glancing armour flashed about their limbs.
6542,BOOK VIII,"Like terrible lions each on other rushed,"
6543,BOOK VIII,"Which fight amid the mountains famine-stung,"
6544,BOOK VIII,Writhing and leaping in the strain of strife
6545,BOOK VIII,"For a slain ox or stag, while all the glens"
6546,BOOK VIII,"Ring with their conflict; so they grappled, so"
6547,BOOK VIII,Clashed they in pitiless strife.  On either hand
6548,BOOK VIII,Long lines of warriors Greek and Trojan toiled
6549,BOOK VIII,In combat: round them roared up flames of war.
6550,BOOK VIII,Like mighty rushing winds they hurled together
6551,BOOK VIII,With eager spears for blood of life athirst.
6552,BOOK VIII,"Hard by them stood Enyo, spurred them on"
6553,BOOK VIII,Ceaselessly: never paused they from the strife.
6554,BOOK VIII,"Now hewed they each the other's shield, and now"
6555,BOOK VIII,"Thrust at the greaves, now at the crested helms."
6556,BOOK VIII,"Reckless of wounds, in that grim toil pressed on"
6557,BOOK VIII,Those aweless heroes: Strife incarnate watched
6558,BOOK VIII,And gloated o'er them.  Ran the sweat in streams
6559,BOOK VIII,"From either: straining hard they stood their ground,"
6560,BOOK VIII,For both were of the seed of Blessed Ones.
6561,BOOK VIII,"From Heaven, with hearts at variance, Gods looked down;"
6562,BOOK VIII,"For some gave glory to Achilles' son,"
6563,BOOK VIII,Some to Eurypylus the godlike.  Still
6564,BOOK VIII,"They fought on, giving ground no more than rock."
6565,BOOK VIII,Of granite mountains.  Rang from side to side
6566,BOOK VIII,"Spear-smitten shields.  At last the Pelian lance,"
6567,BOOK VIII,"Sped onward by a mighty thrust, hath passed"
6568,BOOK VIII,Clear through Eurypylus' throat.  Forth poured the blood
6569,BOOK VIII,Torrent-like; through the portal of the wound
6570,BOOK VIII,The soul from the body flew: darkness of death
6571,BOOK VIII,Dropped o'er his eyes.  To earth in clanging arms
6572,BOOK VIII,"He fell, like stately pine or silver fir"
6573,BOOK VIII,Uprooted by the fury of Boreas;
6574,BOOK VIII,Such space of earth Eurypylus' giant frame
6575,BOOK VIII,Covered in falling: rang again the floor
6576,BOOK VIII,And plain of Troyland.  Grey death-pallor swept
6577,BOOK VIII,"Over the corpse, and all the flush of life"
6578,BOOK VIII,Faded away.  With a triumphant laugh
6579,BOOK VIII,Shouted the mighty hero over him:
6580,BOOK VIII,"""Eurypylus, thou saidst thou wouldst destroy"
6581,BOOK VIII,"The Danaan ships and men, wouldst slay us all"
6582,BOOK VIII,Wretchedly--but the Gods would not fulfil
6583,BOOK VIII,"Thy wish.  For all thy might invincible,"
6584,BOOK VIII,My father's massy spear hath now subdued
6585,BOOK VIII,"Thee under me, that spear no man shall 'scape,"
6586,BOOK VIII,"Though he be brass all through, who faceth me."""
6587,BOOK VIII,
6588,BOOK VIII,"He spake, and tore the long lance from the corse,"
6589,BOOK VIII,"While shrank the Trojans back in dread, at sight"
6590,BOOK VIII,Of that strong-hearted man.  Straightway he stripped
6591,BOOK VIII,"The armour from the dead, for friends to bear"
6592,BOOK VIII,Fast to the ships Achaean.  But himself
6593,BOOK VIII,To the swift chariot and the tireless steeds
6594,BOOK VIII,"Sprang, and sped onward like a thunderbolt"
6595,BOOK VIII,That lightning-girdled leaps through the wide air
6596,BOOK VIII,From Zeus's hands unconquerable--the bolt
6597,BOOK VIII,Before whose downrush all the Immortals quail
6598,BOOK VIII,"Save only Zeus.  It rusheth down to earth,"
6599,BOOK VIII,It rendeth trees and rugged mountain-crags;
6600,BOOK VIII,"So rushed he on the Trojans, flashing doom"
6601,BOOK VIII,Before their eyes; dashed to the earth they fell
6602,BOOK VIII,Before the charge of those immortal steeds:
6603,BOOK VIII,"The earth was heaped with slain, was dyed with gore."
6604,BOOK VIII,As when in mountain-glens the unnumbered leaves
6605,BOOK VIII,"Down-streaming thick and fast hide all the ground,"
6606,BOOK VIII,So hosts of Troy untold on earth were strewn
6607,BOOK VIII,"By Neoptolemus and fierce-hearted Greeks,"
6608,BOOK VIII,Shed by whose hands the blood in torrents ran
6609,BOOK VIII,'Neath feet of men and horses.  Chariot-rails
6610,BOOK VIII,Were dashed with blood-spray whirled up from the tyres.
6611,BOOK VIII,
6612,BOOK VIII,Now had the Trojans fled within their gates
6613,BOOK VIII,"As calves that flee a lion, or as swine"
6614,BOOK VIII,"Flee from a storm--but murderous Ares came,"
6615,BOOK VIII,"Unmarked of other Gods, down from the heavens,"
6616,BOOK VIII,Eager to help the warrior sons of Troy.
6617,BOOK VIII,"Red-fire and Flame, Tumult and Panic-fear,"
6618,BOOK VIII,"His car-steeds, bare him down into the fight,"
6619,BOOK VIII,The coursers which to roaring Boreas
6620,BOOK VIII,"Grim-eyed Erinnys bare, coursers that breathed"
6621,BOOK VIII,"Life-blasting flame: groaned all the shivering air,"
6622,BOOK VIII,As battleward they sped.  Swiftly he came
6623,BOOK VIII,To Troy: loud rang the earth beneath the feet
6624,BOOK VIII,Of that wild team.  Into the battle's heart
6625,BOOK VIII,"Tossing his massy spear, he came; with a shout"
6626,BOOK VIII,He cheered the Trojans on to face the foe.
6627,BOOK VIII,"They heard, and marvelled at that wondrous cry,"
6628,BOOK VIII,"Not seeing the God's immortal form, nor steeds,"
6629,BOOK VIII,Veiled in dense mist.  But the wise prophet-soul
6630,BOOK VIII,Of Helenus knew the voice divine that leapt
6631,BOOK VIII,"Unto the Trojans' ears, they knew not whence,"
6632,BOOK VIII,And with glad heart to the fleeing host he cried:
6633,BOOK VIII,"""O cravens, wherefore fear Achilles' son,"
6634,BOOK VIII,Though ne'er so brave?  He is mortal even as we;
6635,BOOK VIII,"His strength is not as Ares' strength, who is come"
6636,BOOK VIII,A very present help in our sore need.
6637,BOOK VIII,"That was his shout far-pealing, bidding us"
6638,BOOK VIII,Fight on against the Argives.  Let your hearts
6639,BOOK VIII,"Be strong, O friends: let courage fill your breasts."
6640,BOOK VIII,No mightier battle-helper can draw nigh
6641,BOOK VIII,To Troy than he.  Who is of more avail
6642,BOOK VIII,"For war than Ares, when he aideth men"
6643,BOOK VIII,"Hard-fighting?  Lo, to our help he cometh now!"
6644,BOOK VIII,"On to the fight!  Cast to the winds your fears!"""
6645,BOOK VIII,
6646,BOOK VIII,"They fled no more, they faced the Argive men,"
6647,BOOK VIII,"As hounds, that mid the copses fled at first,"
6648,BOOK VIII,"Turn them about to face and fight the wolf,"
6649,BOOK VIII,Spurred by the chiding of their shepherd-lord;
6650,BOOK VIII,"So turned the sons of Troy again to war,"
6651,BOOK VIII,Casting away their fear.  Man leapt on man
6652,BOOK VIII,Valiantly fighting; loud their armour clashed
6653,BOOK VIII,"Smitten with swords, with lances, and with darts."
6654,BOOK VIII,Spears plunged into men's flesh: dread Ares drank
6655,BOOK VIII,"His fill of blood: struck down fell man on man,"
6656,BOOK VIII,As Greek and Trojan fought.  In level poise
6657,BOOK VIII,The battle-balance hung.  As when young men
6658,BOOK VIII,"In hot haste prune a vineyard with the steel,"
6659,BOOK VIII,"And each keeps pace with each in rivalry,"
6660,BOOK VIII,Since all in strength and age be equal-matched;
6661,BOOK VIII,So did the awful scales of battle hang
6662,BOOK VIII,"Level: all Trojan hearts beat high, and firm"
6663,BOOK VIII,"Stood they in trust on aweless Ares' might,"
6664,BOOK VIII,While the Greeks trusted in Achilles' son.
6665,BOOK VIII,Ever they slew and slew: stalked through the midst
6666,BOOK VIII,"Deadly Enyo, her shoulders and her hands"
6667,BOOK VIII,"Blood-splashed, while fearful sweat streamed from her limbs."
6668,BOOK VIII,"Revelling in equal fight, she aided none,"
6669,BOOK VIII,Lest Thetis' or the War-god's wrath be stirred.
6670,BOOK VIII,
6671,BOOK VIII,"Then Neoptolemus slew one far-renowned,"
6672,BOOK VIII,"Perimedes, who had dwelt by Smintheus' grove;"
6673,BOOK VIII,"Next Cestrus died, Phalerus battle-staunch,"
6674,BOOK VIII,"Perilaus the strong, Menalcas lord of spears,"
6675,BOOK VIII,Whom Iphianassa bare by the haunted foot
6676,BOOK VIII,Of Cilla to the cunning craftsman Medon.
6677,BOOK VIII,"In the home-land afar the sire abode,"
6678,BOOK VIII,And never kissed his son's returning head:
6679,BOOK VIII,For that fair home and all his cunning works
6680,BOOK VIII,Did far-off kinsmen wrangle o'er his grave.
6681,BOOK VIII,Deiphobus slew Lycon battle-staunch:
6682,BOOK VIII,"The lance-head pierced him close above the groin,"
6683,BOOK VIII,And round the long spear all his bowels gushed out.
6684,BOOK VIII,"Aeneas smote down Dymas, who erewhile"
6685,BOOK VIII,"In Aulis dwelt, and followed unto Troy"
6686,BOOK VIII,"Arcesilaus, and saw never more"
6687,BOOK VIII,"The dear home-land.  Euryalus hurled a dart,"
6688,BOOK VIII,And through Astraeus' breast the death-winged point
6689,BOOK VIII,"Flew, shearing through the breathways of man's life;"
6690,BOOK VIII,And all that lay within was drenched with blood.
6691,BOOK VIII,And hard thereby great-souled Agenor slew
6692,BOOK VIII,"Hippomenes, hero Teucer's comrade staunch,"
6693,BOOK VIII,With one swift thrust 'twixt shoulder and neck: his soul
6694,BOOK VIII,Rushed forth in blood; death's night swept over him.
6695,BOOK VIII,Grief for his comrade slain on Teucer fell;
6696,BOOK VIII,"He strained his bow, a swift-winged shaft he sped,"
6697,BOOK VIII,"But smote him not, for slightly Agenor swerved."
6698,BOOK VIII,Yet nigh him Deiophontes stood; the shaft
6699,BOOK VIII,"Into his left eye plunged, passed through the ball,"
6700,BOOK VIII,"And out through his right ear, because the Fates"
6701,BOOK VIII,Whither they willed thrust on the bitter barbs.
6702,BOOK VIII,"Even as in agony he leapt full height,"
6703,BOOK VIII,Yet once again the archer's arrow hissed:
6704,BOOK VIII,"It pierced his throat, through the neck-sinews cleft"
6705,BOOK VIII,"Unswerving, and his hard doom came on him."
6706,BOOK VIII,
6707,BOOK VIII,So man to man dealt death; and joyed the Fates
6708,BOOK VIII,"And Doom, and fell Strife in her maddened glee"
6709,BOOK VIII,"Shouted aloud, and Ares terribly"
6710,BOOK VIII,"Shouted in answer, and with courage thrilled"
6711,BOOK VIII,"The Trojans, and with panic fear the Greeks,"
6712,BOOK VIII,And shook their reeling squadrons.  But one man
6713,BOOK VIII,"He scared not, even Achilles' son; he abode,"
6714,BOOK VIII,"And fought undaunted, slaying foes on foes."
6715,BOOK VIII,As when a young lad sweeps his hand around
6716,BOOK VIII,"Flies swarming over milk, and nigh the bowl"
6717,BOOK VIII,"Here, there they lie, struck dead by that light touch,"
6718,BOOK VIII,And gleefully the child still plies the work;
6719,BOOK VIII,So stern Achilles' glorious scion joyed
6720,BOOK VIII,"Over the slain, and recked not of the God"
6721,BOOK VIII,Who spurred the Trojans on: man after man
6722,BOOK VIII,Tasted his vengeance of their charging host.
6723,BOOK VIII,Even as a giant mountain-peak withstands
6724,BOOK VIII,"On-rushing hurricane-blasts, so he abode"
6725,BOOK VIII,Unquailing.  Ares at his eager mood
6726,BOOK VIII,"Grew wroth, and would have cast his veil of cloud"
6727,BOOK VIII,"Away, and met him face to face in fight,"
6728,BOOK VIII,But now Athena from Olympus swooped
6729,BOOK VIII,To forest-mantled Ida.  Quaked the earth
6730,BOOK VIII,And Xanthus' murmuring streams; so mightily
6731,BOOK VIII,She shook them: terror-stricken were the souls
6732,BOOK VIII,"Of all the Nymphs, adread for Priam's town."
6733,BOOK VIII,From her immortal armour flashed around
6734,BOOK VIII,The hovering lightnings; fearful serpents breathed
6735,BOOK VIII,Fire from her shield invincible; the crest
6736,BOOK VIII,Of her great helmet swept the clouds.  And now
6737,BOOK VIII,She was at point to close in sudden fight
6738,BOOK VIII,With Ares; but the mighty will of Zeus
6739,BOOK VIII,"Daunted them both, from high heaven thundering"
6740,BOOK VIII,"His terrors.  Ares drew back from the war,"
6741,BOOK VIII,For manifest to him was Zeus's wrath.
6742,BOOK VIII,To wintry Thrace he passed; his haughty heart
6743,BOOK VIII,Reeked no more of the Trojans.  In the plain
6744,BOOK VIII,Of Troy no more stayed Pallas; she was gone
6745,BOOK VIII,To hallowed Athens.  But the armies still
6746,BOOK VIII,Strove in the deadly fray; and fainted now
6747,BOOK VIII,The Trojans' prowess; but all battle-fain
6748,BOOK VIII,The Argives pressed on these as they gave ground.
6749,BOOK VIII,As winds chase ships that fly with straining sails
6750,BOOK VIII,On to the outsea--as on forest-brakes
6751,BOOK VIII,Leapeth the fury of flame--as swift hounds drive
6752,BOOK VIII,"Deer through the mountains, eager for the prey,"
6753,BOOK VIII,So did the Argives chase them: Achilles' son
6754,BOOK VIII,"Still cheered them on, still slew with that great spear"
6755,BOOK VIII,"Whomso he overtook.  On, on they fled"
6756,BOOK VIII,Till into stately-gated Troy they poured.
6757,BOOK VIII,
6758,BOOK VIII,Then had the Argives a short breathing-space
6759,BOOK VIII,"From war, when they had penned the hosts of Troy"
6760,BOOK VIII,"In Priam's burg, as shepherds pen up lambs"
6761,BOOK VIII,"Upon a lonely steading.  And, as when"
6762,BOOK VIII,"After hard strain, a breathing-space is given"
6763,BOOK VIII,"To oxen that, quick-panting 'neath the yoke,"
6764,BOOK VIII,"Up a steep hill have dragged a load, so breathed"
6765,BOOK VIII,Awhile the Achaeans after toil in arms.
6766,BOOK VIII,Then once more hot for the fray did they beset
6767,BOOK VIII,The city-towers.  But now with gates fast barred
6768,BOOK VIII,The Trojans from the walls withstood the assault.
6769,BOOK VIII,As when within their steading shepherd-folk
6770,BOOK VIII,"Abide the lowering tempest, when a day"
6771,BOOK VIII,"Of storm hath dawned, with fury of lightnings, rain"
6772,BOOK VIII,"And heavy-drifting snow, and dare not haste"
6773,BOOK VIII,"Forth to the pasture, howsoever fain,"
6774,BOOK VIII,"Till the great storm abate, and rivers, wide"
6775,BOOK VIII,"With rushing floods, again be passable;"
6776,BOOK VIII,So trembling on their walls they abode the rage
6777,BOOK VIII,Of foes against their ramparts surging fast.
6778,BOOK VIII,And as when daws or starlings drop in clouds
6779,BOOK VIII,"Down on an orchard-close, full fain to feast"
6780,BOOK VIII,"Upon its pleasant fruits, and take no heed"
6781,BOOK VIII,"Of men that shout to scare them thence away,"
6782,BOOK VIII,Until the reckless hunger be appeased
6783,BOOK VIII,That makes them bold; so poured round Priam's burg
6784,BOOK VIII,The furious Danaans.  Against the gates
6785,BOOK VIII,"They hurled themselves, they strove to batter down"
6786,BOOK VIII,The mighty-souled Earth-shaker's work divine.
6787,BOOK VIII,
6788,BOOK VIII,"Yet did tim Troyfolk not, despite their fear,"
6789,BOOK VIII,"Flinch from the fight: they manned their towers, they toiled"
6790,BOOK VIII,Unresting: ever from the fair-built walls
6791,BOOK VIII,"Leapt arrows, stones, and fleet-winged javelins down"
6792,BOOK VIII,Amidst the thronging foes; for Phoebus thrilled
6793,BOOK VIII,Their souls with steadfast hardihood.  Fain was he
6794,BOOK VIII,"To save them still, though Hector was no more."
6795,BOOK VIII,
6796,BOOK VIII,"Then Meriones shot forth a deadly shaft,"
6797,BOOK VIII,"And smote Phylodamas, Polites' friend,"
6798,BOOK VIII,Beneath the jaw; the arrow pierced his throat.
6799,BOOK VIII,"Down fell he like a vulture, from a rock"
6800,BOOK VIII,By fowler's barbed arrow shot and slain;
6801,BOOK VIII,So from the high tower swiftly down he fell:
6802,BOOK VIII,His life fled; clanged his armour o'er the corpse.
6803,BOOK VIII,With laughter of triumph stalwart Molus' son
6804,BOOK VIII,"A second arrow sped, with strong desire"
6805,BOOK VIII,"To smite Polites, ill-starred Priam's son:"
6806,BOOK VIII,But with a swift side-swerve did he escape
6807,BOOK VIII,"The death, nor did the arrow touch his flesh."
6808,BOOK VIII,"As when a shipman, as his bark flies on"
6809,BOOK VIII,"O'er sea-gulfs, spies amid the rushing tide"
6810,BOOK VIII,"A rock, and to escape it swiftly puts"
6811,BOOK VIII,"The helm about, and turns aside the ship"
6812,BOOK VIII,"Even as he listeth, that a little strength"
6813,BOOK VIII,Averts a great disaster; so did he
6814,BOOK VIII,Foresee and shun the deadly shaft of doom.
6815,BOOK VIII,
6816,BOOK VIII,"Ever they fought on; walls, towers, battlements"
6817,BOOK VIII,"Were blood-besprent, wherever Trojans fell"
6818,BOOK VIII,Slain by the arrows of the stalwart Greeks.
6819,BOOK VIII,Yet these escaped not scatheless; many of them
6820,BOOK VIII,Dyed the earth red: aye waxed the havoc of death
6821,BOOK VIII,As friends and foes were stricken.  O'er the strife
6822,BOOK VIII,"Shouted for glee Enyo, sister of War."
6823,BOOK VIII,
6824,BOOK VIII,"Now had the Argives burst the gates, had breached"
6825,BOOK VIII,"The walls of Troy, for boundless was their might;"
6826,BOOK VIII,"But Ganymedes saw from heaven, and cried,"
6827,BOOK VIII,Anguished with fear for his own fatherland:
6828,BOOK VIII,"""O Father Zeus, if of thy seed I am,"
6829,BOOK VIII,If at thine best I left far-famous Troy
6830,BOOK VIII,"For immortality with deathless Gods,"
6831,BOOK VIII,"O hear me now, whose soul is anguish-thrilled!"
6832,BOOK VIII,I cannot bear to see my fathers' town
6833,BOOK VIII,"In flames, my kindred in disastrous strife"
6834,BOOK VIII,Perishing: bitterer sorrow is there none!
6835,BOOK VIII,"Oh, if thine heart is fixed to do this thing,"
6836,BOOK VIII,Let me be far hence!  Less shall be my grief
6837,BOOK VIII,If I behold it not with these mine eyes.
6838,BOOK VIII,That is the depth of horror and of shame
6839,BOOK VIII,"To see one's country wrecked by hands of foes."""
6840,BOOK VIII,
6841,BOOK VIII,With groans and tears so pleaded Ganymede.
6842,BOOK VIII,Then Zeus himself with one vast pall of cloud
6843,BOOK VIII,Veiled all the city of Priam world-renowned;
6844,BOOK VIII,"And all the murderous fight was drowned in mist,"
6845,BOOK VIII,And like a vanished phantom was the wall
6846,BOOK VIII,In vapours heavy-hung no eye could pierce;
6847,BOOK VIII,"And all around crashed thunders, lightnings flamed"
6848,BOOK VIII,From heaven.  The Danaans heard Zeus' clarion peal
6849,BOOK VIII,Awe-struck; and Neleus' son cried unto them:
6850,BOOK VIII,"""Far-famous lords of Argives, all our strength"
6851,BOOK VIII,"Palsied shall be, while Zeus protecteth thus"
6852,BOOK VIII,Our foes.  A great tide of calamity
6853,BOOK VIII,On us is rolling; haste we then to the ships;
6854,BOOK VIII,"Cease we awhile from bitter toil of strife,"
6855,BOOK VIII,Lest the fire of his wrath consume us all.
6856,BOOK VIII,Submit we to his portents; needs must all
6857,BOOK VIII,"Obey him ever, who is mightier far"
6858,BOOK VIII,"Than all strong Gods, all weakling sons of men."
6859,BOOK VIII,On the presumptuous Titans once in wrath
6860,BOOK VIII,He poured down fire from heaven: then burned all earth
6861,BOOK VIII,"Beneath, and Ocean's world-engirdling flood"
6862,BOOK VIII,"Boiled from its depths, yea, to its utmost bounds:"
6863,BOOK VIII,Far-flowing mighty rivers were dried up:
6864,BOOK VIII,"Perished all broods of life-sustaining earth,"
6865,BOOK VIII,"All fosterlings of the boundless sea, and all"
6866,BOOK VIII,Dwellers in rivers: smoke and ashes veiled
6867,BOOK VIII,The air: earth fainted in the fervent heat.
6868,BOOK VIII,Therefore this day I dread the might of Zeus.
6869,BOOK VIII,"Now, pass we to the ships, since for to-day"
6870,BOOK VIII,He helpeth Troy.  To us too shall he grant
6871,BOOK VIII,"Glory hereafter; for the dawn on men,"
6872,BOOK VIII,"Though whiles it frown, anon shall smile.  Not yet,"
6873,BOOK VIII,"But soon, shall Fate lead us to smite yon town,"
6874,BOOK VIII,If true indeed was Calchas' prophecy
6875,BOOK VIII,"Spoken aforetime to the assembled Greeks,"
6876,BOOK VIII,"That in the tenth year Priam's burg should fall."""
6877,BOOK VIII,
6878,BOOK VIII,"Then left they that far-famous town, and turned"
6879,BOOK VIII,"From war, in awe of Zeus's threatenings,"
6880,BOOK VIII,Hearkening to one with ancient wisdom wise.
6881,BOOK VIII,"Yet they forgat not friends in battle slain,"
6882,BOOK VIII,But bare them from the field and buried them.
6883,BOOK VIII,"These the mist hid not, but the town alone"
6884,BOOK VIII,"And its unscaleable wall, around which fell"
6885,BOOK VIII,Trojans and Argives many in battle slain.
6886,BOOK VIII,"So came they to the ships, and put from them"
6887,BOOK VIII,"Their battle-gear, and strode into the waves"
6888,BOOK VIII,"Of Hellespont fair-flowing, and washed away"
6889,BOOK VIII,All stain of dust and sweat and clotted gore.
6890,BOOK VIII,
6891,BOOK VIII,The sun drave down his never-wearying steeds
6892,BOOK VIII,"Into the dark west: night streamed o'er the earth,"
6893,BOOK VIII,Bidding men cease from toil.  The Argives then
6894,BOOK VIII,Acclaimed Achilles' valiant son with praise
6895,BOOK VIII,High as his father's.  Mid triumphant mirth
6896,BOOK VIII,He feasted in kings' tents: no battle-toil
6897,BOOK VIII,Had wearied him; for Thetis from his limbs
6898,BOOK VIII,"Had charmed all ache of travail, making him"
6899,BOOK VIII,As one whom labour had no power to tire.
6900,BOOK VIII,"When his strong heart was satisfied with meat,"
6901,BOOK VIII,"He passed to his father's tent, and over him"
6902,BOOK VIII,Sleep's dews were poured.  The Greeks slept in the plain
6903,BOOK VIII,"Before the ships, by ever-changing guards"
6904,BOOK VIII,"Watched; for they dreaded lest the host of Troy,"
6905,BOOK VIII,"Or of her staunch allies, should kindle flame"
6906,BOOK VIII,"Upon the ships, and from them all cut off"
6907,BOOK VIII,Their home-return.  In Priam's burg the while
6908,BOOK VIII,"By gate and wall men watched and slept in turn,"
6909,BOOK VIII,Adread to hear the Argives' onset-shout.
6910,BOOK VIII,
6911,BOOK VIII,
6912,BOOK VIII,
6913,BOOK IX,BOOK IX
6914,BOOK IX,
6915,BOOK IX,How from his long lone exile returned to the war Philoctetes.
6916,BOOK IX,
6917,BOOK IX,
6918,BOOK IX,"When ended was night's darkness, and the Dawn"
6919,BOOK IX,"Rose from the world's verge, and the wide air glowed"
6920,BOOK IX,"With splendour, then did Argos' warrior-sons"
6921,BOOK IX,"Gaze o'er the plain; and lo, all cloudless-clear"
6922,BOOK IX,Stood Ilium's towers.  The marvel of yesterday
6923,BOOK IX,Seemed a strange dream.  No thought the Trojans had
6924,BOOK IX,Of standing forth to fight without the wall.
6925,BOOK IX,"A great fear held them thralls, the awful thought"
6926,BOOK IX,That yet alive was Peleus' glorious son.
6927,BOOK IX,But to the King of Heaven Antenor cried:
6928,BOOK IX,"""Zeus, Lord of Ida and the starry sky,"
6929,BOOK IX,Hearken my prayer!  Oh turn back from our town
6930,BOOK IX,"That battle-eager murderous-hearted man,"
6931,BOOK IX,Be he Achilles who hath not passed down
6932,BOOK IX,"To Hades, or some other like to him."
6933,BOOK IX,For now in heaven-descended Priam's burg
6934,BOOK IX,By thousands are her people perishing:
6935,BOOK IX,No respite cometh from calamity:
6936,BOOK IX,Murder and havoc evermore increase.
6937,BOOK IX,"O Father Zeus, thou carest not though we"
6938,BOOK IX,"Be slaughtered of our foes: thou helpest them,"
6939,BOOK IX,"Forgetting thy son, godlike Dardanus!"
6940,BOOK IX,"But, if this be the purpose of thine heart"
6941,BOOK IX,"That Argives shall destroy us wretchedly,"
6942,BOOK IX,"Now do it: draw not out our agony!"""
6943,BOOK IX,
6944,BOOK IX,In passionate prayer he cried; and Zeus from heaven
6945,BOOK IX,"Hearkened, and hasted on the end of all,"
6946,BOOK IX,Which else he had delayed.  He granted him
6947,BOOK IX,"This awful boon, that myriads of Troy's sons"
6948,BOOK IX,Should with their children perish: but that prayer
6949,BOOK IX,"He granted not, to turn Achilles' son"
6950,BOOK IX,"Back from the wide-wayed town; nay, all the more"
6951,BOOK IX,"He enkindled him to war, for he would now"
6952,BOOK IX,Give grace and glory to the Nereid Queen.
6953,BOOK IX,
6954,BOOK IX,"So purposed he, of all Gods mightiest."
6955,BOOK IX,But now between the city and Hellespont
6956,BOOK IX,Were Greeks and Trojans burning men and steeds
6957,BOOK IX,"In battle slain, while paused the murderous strife."
6958,BOOK IX,For Priam sent his herald Menoetes forth
6959,BOOK IX,"To Agamemnon and the Achaean chiefs,"
6960,BOOK IX,Asking a truce wherein to burn the dead;
6961,BOOK IX,"And they, of reverence for the slain, gave ear;"
6962,BOOK IX,For wrath pursueth not the dead.  And when
6963,BOOK IX,"They had lain their slain on those close-thronging pyres,"
6964,BOOK IX,"Then did the Argives to their tents return,"
6965,BOOK IX,And unto Priam's gold-abounding halls
6966,BOOK IX,"The Trojans, for Eurypylus sorrowing sore:"
6967,BOOK IX,For even as Priam's sons they honoured him.
6968,BOOK IX,"Therefore apart from all the other slain,"
6969,BOOK IX,Before the Gate Dardanian--where the streams
6970,BOOK IX,Of eddying Xanthus down from Ida flow
6971,BOOK IX,Fed by the rains of heavens--they buried him.
6972,BOOK IX,
6973,BOOK IX,Aweless Achilles' son the while went forth
6974,BOOK IX,"To his sire's huge tomb.  Outpouring tears, he kissed"
6975,BOOK IX,"The tall memorial pillar of the dead,"
6976,BOOK IX,"And groaning clasped it round, and thus he cried:"
6977,BOOK IX,"""Hail, father!  Though beneath the earth thou lie"
6978,BOOK IX,"In Hades' halls, I shall forget thee not."
6979,BOOK IX,Oh to have met thee living mid the host!
6980,BOOK IX,"Then of each other had our souls had joy,"
6981,BOOK IX,Then of her wealth had we spoiled Ilium.
6982,BOOK IX,"But now, thou hast not seen thy child, nor I"
6983,BOOK IX,"Seen thee, who yearned to look on thee in life."
6984,BOOK IX,"Yet, though thou be afar amidst the dead,"
6985,BOOK IX,"Thy spear, thy son, have made thy foes to quail;"
6986,BOOK IX,And Danaans with exceeding joy behold
6987,BOOK IX,"One like to thee in stature, fame and deeds."""
6988,BOOK IX,
6989,BOOK IX,"He spake, and wiped the hot tears from his face;"
6990,BOOK IX,And to his father's ships passed swiftly thence:
6991,BOOK IX,"With him went Myrmidon warriors two and ten,"
6992,BOOK IX,And white-haired Phoenix followed on with these
6993,BOOK IX,Woefully sighing for the glorious dead.
6994,BOOK IX,
6995,BOOK IX,"Night rose o'er earth, the stars flashed out in heaven;"
6996,BOOK IX,"So these brake bread, and slept till woke the Dawn."
6997,BOOK IX,Then the Greeks donned their armour: flashed afar
6998,BOOK IX,Its splendour up to the very firmament.
6999,BOOK IX,"Forth of their gates in one great throng they poured,"
7000,BOOK IX,"Like snowflakes thick and fast, which drift adown"
7001,BOOK IX,Heavily from the clouds in winter's cold;
7002,BOOK IX,"So streamed they forth before the wall, and rose"
7003,BOOK IX,Their dread shout: groaned the deep earth 'neath their tramp.
7004,BOOK IX,
7005,BOOK IX,"The Trojans heard that shout, and saw that host,"
7006,BOOK IX,And marvelled.  Crushed with fear were all their hearts
7007,BOOK IX,Foreboding doom; for like a huge cloud seemed
7008,BOOK IX,That throng of foes: with clashing arms they came:
7009,BOOK IX,Volumed and vast the dust rose 'neath their feet.
7010,BOOK IX,Then either did some God with hardihood thrill
7011,BOOK IX,"Deiphobus' heart, and made it void of fear,"
7012,BOOK IX,"Or his own spirit spurred him on to fight,"
7013,BOOK IX,To drive by thrust of spear that terrible host
7014,BOOK IX,Of foemen from the city of his birth.
7015,BOOK IX,So there in Troy he cried with heartening speech:
7016,BOOK IX,"""O friends, be stout of heart to play the men!"
7017,BOOK IX,Remember all the agonies that war
7018,BOOK IX,Brings in the end to them that yield to foes.
7019,BOOK IX,"Ye wrestle not for Alexander alone,"
7020,BOOK IX,"Nor Helen, but for home, for your own lives,"
7021,BOOK IX,"For wives, for little ones, for parents grey,"
7022,BOOK IX,"For all the grace of life, for all ye have,"
7023,BOOK IX,For this dear land--oh may she shroud me o'er
7024,BOOK IX,"Slain in the battle, ere I see her lie"
7025,BOOK IX,'Neath foemen's spears--my country!  I know not
7026,BOOK IX,A bitterer pang than this for hapless men!
7027,BOOK IX,O be ye strong for battle!  Forth to the fight
7028,BOOK IX,"With me, and thrust this horror far away!"
7029,BOOK IX,Think not Achilles liveth still to war
7030,BOOK IX,Against us: him the ravening fire consumed.
7031,BOOK IX,Some other Achaean was it who so late
7032,BOOK IX,"Enkindled them to war.  Oh, shame it were"
7033,BOOK IX,If men who fight for fatherland should fear
7034,BOOK IX,"Achilles' self, or any Greek beside!"
7035,BOOK IX,Let us not flinch from war-toil!  have we not
7036,BOOK IX,Endured much battle-travail heretofore?
7037,BOOK IX,"What, know ye not that to men sorely tried"
7038,BOOK IX,Prosperity and joyance follow toil?
7039,BOOK IX,So after scourging winds and ruining storms
7040,BOOK IX,Zeus brings to men a morn of balmy air;
7041,BOOK IX,"After disease new strength comes, after war"
7042,BOOK IX,"Peace: all things know Time's changeless law of change."""
7043,BOOK IX,
7044,BOOK IX,Then eager all for war they armed themselves
7045,BOOK IX,In haste.  All through the town rang clangour of arms
7046,BOOK IX,As for grim fight strong men arrayed their limbs.
7047,BOOK IX,"Here stood a wife, shuddering with dread of war,"
7048,BOOK IX,"Yet piling, as she wept, her husband's arms"
7049,BOOK IX,Before his feet.  There little children brought
7050,BOOK IX,To a father his war-gear with eager haste;
7051,BOOK IX,"And now his heart was wrung to hear their sobs,"
7052,BOOK IX,"And now he smiled on those small ministers,"
7053,BOOK IX,And stronger waxed his heart's resolve to fight
7054,BOOK IX,"To the last gasp for these, the near and dear."
7055,BOOK IX,"Yonder again, with hands that had not lost"
7056,BOOK IX,"Old cunning, a grey father for the fray"
7057,BOOK IX,"Girded a son, and murmured once and again:"
7058,BOOK IX,"""Dear boy, yield thou to no man in the war!"""
7059,BOOK IX,"And showed his son the old scars on his breast,"
7060,BOOK IX,Proud memories of fights fought long ago.
7061,BOOK IX,
7062,BOOK IX,"So when they all stood mailed in battle-gear,"
7063,BOOK IX,Forth of the gates they poured all eager-souled
7064,BOOK IX,For war.  Against the chariots of the Greeks
7065,BOOK IX,Their chariots charged; their ranks of footmen pressed
7066,BOOK IX,To meet the footmen of the foe.  The earth
7067,BOOK IX,Rang to the tramp of onset; pealed the cheer
7068,BOOK IX,From man to man; swift closed the fronts of war.
7069,BOOK IX,Loud clashed their arms all round; from either side
7070,BOOK IX,War-cries were mingled in one awful roar
7071,BOOK IX,Swift-winged full many a dart and arrow flew
7072,BOOK IX,From host to host; loud clanged the smitten shields
7073,BOOK IX,"'Neath thrusting spears, 'neath javelin-point and sword:"
7074,BOOK IX,Men hewed with battle-axes lightening down;
7075,BOOK IX,Crimson the armour ran with blood of men.
7076,BOOK IX,And all this while Troy's wives and daughters watched
7077,BOOK IX,From high walls that grim battle of the strong.
7078,BOOK IX,"All trembled as they prayed for husbands, sons,"
7079,BOOK IX,"And brothers: white-haired sires amidst them sat,"
7080,BOOK IX,"And gazed, while anguished fear for sons devoured"
7081,BOOK IX,Their hearts.  But Helen in her bower abode
7082,BOOK IX,"Amidst her maids, there held by utter shame."
7083,BOOK IX,
7084,BOOK IX,"So without pause before the wall they fought,"
7085,BOOK IX,While Death exulted o'er them; deadly Strife
7086,BOOK IX,Shrieked out a long wild cry from host to host.
7087,BOOK IX,With blood of slain men dust became red mire:
7088,BOOK IX,"Here, there, fast fell the warriors mid the fray."
7089,BOOK IX,
7090,BOOK IX,Then slew Deiphobus the charioteer
7091,BOOK IX,"Of Nestor, Hippasus' son: from that high car"
7092,BOOK IX,Down fell he 'midst the dead; fear seized his lord
7093,BOOK IX,"Lest, while his hands were cumbered with the reins,"
7094,BOOK IX,He too by Priam's strong son might be slain.
7095,BOOK IX,Melanthius marked his plight: swiftly he sprang
7096,BOOK IX,"Upon the car; he urged the horses on,"
7097,BOOK IX,"Shaking the reins, goading them with his spear,"
7098,BOOK IX,Seeing the scourge was lost.  But Priam's son
7099,BOOK IX,"Left these, and plunged amid a throng of foes."
7100,BOOK IX,There upon many he brought the day of doom;
7101,BOOK IX,For like a ruining tempest on he stormed
7102,BOOK IX,Through reeling ranks.  His mighty hand struck down
7103,BOOK IX,Foes numberless: the plain was heaped with dead.
7104,BOOK IX,
7105,BOOK IX,As when a woodman on the long-ridged hills
7106,BOOK IX,"Plunges amid the forest-depths, and hews"
7107,BOOK IX,"With might and main, and fells sap-laden trees"
7108,BOOK IX,To make him store of charcoal from the heaps
7109,BOOK IX,Of billets overturfed and set afire:
7110,BOOK IX,"The trunks on all sides fallen strew the slopes,"
7111,BOOK IX,While o'er his work the man exulteth; so
7112,BOOK IX,Before Deiphobus' swift death-dealing hands
7113,BOOK IX,In heaps the Achaeans each on other fell.
7114,BOOK IX,The charging lines of Troy swept over some;
7115,BOOK IX,Some fled to Xanthus' stream: Deiphobus chased
7116,BOOK IX,"Into the flood yet more, and slew and slew."
7117,BOOK IX,As when on fish-abounding Hellespont's strand
7118,BOOK IX,The fishermen hard-straining drag a net
7119,BOOK IX,"Forth of the depths to land; but, while it trails"
7120,BOOK IX,"Yet through the sea, one leaps amid the waves"
7121,BOOK IX,Grasping in hand a sinuous-headed spear
7122,BOOK IX,"To deal the sword-fish death, and here and there,"
7123,BOOK IX,"Fast as he meets them, slays them, and with blood"
7124,BOOK IX,The waves are reddened; so were Xanthus' streams
7125,BOOK IX,"Impurpled by his hands, and choked with dead."
7126,BOOK IX,
7127,BOOK IX,Yet not without sore loss the Trojans fought;
7128,BOOK IX,For all this while Peleides' fierce-heart son
7129,BOOK IX,Of other ranks made havoc.  Thetis gazed
7130,BOOK IX,"Rejoicing in her son's son, with a joy"
7131,BOOK IX,As great as was her grief for Achilles slain.
7132,BOOK IX,For a great host beneath his spear were hurled
7133,BOOK IX,"Down to the dust, steeds, warriors slaughter-blent."
7134,BOOK IX,"And still he chased, and still he slew: he smote"
7135,BOOK IX,"Amides war-renowned, who on his steed"
7136,BOOK IX,"Bore down on him, but of his horsemanship"
7137,BOOK IX,Small profit won.  The bright spear pierced him through
7138,BOOK IX,"From navel unto spine, and all his bowels"
7139,BOOK IX,"Gushed out, and deadly Doom laid hold on him"
7140,BOOK IX,Even as he fell beside his horse's feet.
7141,BOOK IX,Ascanius and Oenops next he slew;
7142,BOOK IX,Under the fifth rib of the one he drave
7143,BOOK IX,"His spear, the other stabbed he 'neath the throat"
7144,BOOK IX,Where a wound bringeth surest doom to man.
7145,BOOK IX,Whomso he met besides he slew--the names
7146,BOOK IX,What man could tell of all that by the hands
7147,BOOK IX,Of Neoptolemus died?  Never his limbs
7148,BOOK IX,"Waxed weary.  As some brawny labourer,"
7149,BOOK IX,With strong hands toiling in a fruitful field
7150,BOOK IX,"The livelong day, rains down to earth the fruit"
7151,BOOK IX,"Of olives, swiftly beating with his pole,"
7152,BOOK IX,"And with the downfall covers all the ground,"
7153,BOOK IX,So fast fell 'neath his hands the thronging foe.
7154,BOOK IX,
7155,BOOK IX,"Elsewhere did Agamemnon, Tydeus' son,"
7156,BOOK IX,And other chieftains of the Danaans toil
7157,BOOK IX,With fury in the fight.  Yet never quailed
7158,BOOK IX,The mighty men of Troy: with heart and soul
7159,BOOK IX,"They also fought, and ever stayed from flight"
7160,BOOK IX,Such as gave back.  Yet many heeded not
7161,BOOK IX,"Their chiefs, but fled, cowed by the Achaeans' might."
7162,BOOK IX,
7163,BOOK IX,Now at the last Achilles' strong son marked
7164,BOOK IX,How fast beside Scamander's outfall Greeks
7165,BOOK IX,Were perishing.  Those Troyward-fleeing foes
7166,BOOK IX,"Whom he had followed slaying, left he now,"
7167,BOOK IX,"And bade Automedon thither drive, where hosts"
7168,BOOK IX,Were falling of the Achaeans.  Straightway he
7169,BOOK IX,"Hearkened, and scourged the steeds immortal on"
7170,BOOK IX,To that wild fray: bearing their lord they flew
7171,BOOK IX,Swiftly o'er battle-highways paved with death.
7172,BOOK IX,
7173,BOOK IX,As Ares chariot-borne to murderous war
7174,BOOK IX,"Fares forth, and round his onrush quakes the ground,"
7175,BOOK IX,While on the God's breast clash celestial arms
7176,BOOK IX,"Outflashing fire, so charged Achilles' son"
7177,BOOK IX,Against Deiphobus.  Clouds of dust upsoared
7178,BOOK IX,About his horses' feet.  Automedon marked
7179,BOOK IX,"The Trojan chief, and knew him.  To his lord"
7180,BOOK IX,Straightway he named that hero war-renowned:
7181,BOOK IX,"""My king, this is Deiphobus' array--"
7182,BOOK IX,The man who from thy father fled in fear.
7183,BOOK IX,"Some God or fiend with courage fills him now."""
7184,BOOK IX,
7185,BOOK IX,"Naught answered Neoptolemus, save to bid"
7186,BOOK IX,"Drive on the steeds yet faster, that with speed"
7187,BOOK IX,He might avert grim death from perishing friends.
7188,BOOK IX,"But when to each other now full nigh they drew,"
7189,BOOK IX,"Deiphobus, despite his battle-lust,"
7190,BOOK IX,"Stayed, as a ravening fire stays when it meets"
7191,BOOK IX,"Water.  He marvelled, seeing Achilles' steeds"
7192,BOOK IX,"And that gigantic son, huge as his sire;"
7193,BOOK IX,"And his heart wavered, choosing now to flee,"
7194,BOOK IX,"And now to face that hero, man to man"
7195,BOOK IX,As when a mountain boar from his young brood
7196,BOOK IX,Chases the jackals--then a lion leaps
7197,BOOK IX,From hidden ambush into view: the boar
7198,BOOK IX,"Halts in his furious onset, loth to advance,"
7199,BOOK IX,"Loth to retreat, while foam his jaws about"
7200,BOOK IX,His whetted tusks; so halted Priam's son
7201,BOOK IX,"Car-steeds and car, perplexed, while quivered his hands"
7202,BOOK IX,About the lance.  Shouted Achilles' son:
7203,BOOK IX,"""Ho, Priam's son, why thus so mad to smite"
7204,BOOK IX,"Those weaker Argives, who have feared thy wrath"
7205,BOOK IX,And fled thine onset?  So thou deem'st thyself
7206,BOOK IX,"Far mightiest!  If thine heart be brave indeed,"
7207,BOOK IX,"Of my spear now make trial in the strife."""
7208,BOOK IX,
7209,BOOK IX,"On rushed he, as a lion against a stag,"
7210,BOOK IX,Borne by the steeds and chariot of his sire.
7211,BOOK IX,"And now full soon his lance had slain his foe,"
7212,BOOK IX,Him and his charioteer--but Phoebus poured
7213,BOOK IX,A dense cloud round him from the viewless heights
7214,BOOK IX,"Of heaven, and snatched him from the deadly fray,"
7215,BOOK IX,"And set him down in Troy, amid the rout"
7216,BOOK IX,Of fleeing Trojans: so did Peleus' son
7217,BOOK IX,Stab but the empty air; and loud he cried:
7218,BOOK IX,"""Dog, thou hast 'scaped my wrath!  No might of thine"
7219,BOOK IX,"Saved thee, though ne'er so fain!  Some God hath cast"
7220,BOOK IX,"Night's veil o'er thee, and snatched thee from thy death."""
7221,BOOK IX,
7222,BOOK IX,Then Cronos' Son dispersed that dense dark cloud:
7223,BOOK IX,Mist-like it thinned and vanished into air:
7224,BOOK IX,Straightway the plain and all the land were seen.
7225,BOOK IX,Then far away about the Scaean Gate
7226,BOOK IX,"He saw the Trojans: seeming like his sire,"
7227,BOOK IX,He sped against them; they at his coming quailed.
7228,BOOK IX,As shipmen tremble when a wild wave bears
7229,BOOK IX,"Down on their bark, wind-heaved until it swings"
7230,BOOK IX,"Broad, mountain-high above them, when the sea"
7231,BOOK IX,"Is mad with tempest; so, as on he came,"
7232,BOOK IX,"Terror clad all those Trojans as a cloak,"
7233,BOOK IX,"The while he shouted, cheering on his men:"
7234,BOOK IX,"""Hear, friends!--fill full your hearts with dauntless strength,"
7235,BOOK IX,The strength that well beseemeth mighty men
7236,BOOK IX,"Who thirst to win them glorious victory,"
7237,BOOK IX,"To win renown from battle's tumult!  Come,"
7238,BOOK IX,"Brave hearts, now strive we even beyond our strength"
7239,BOOK IX,"Till we smite Troy's proud city, till we win"
7240,BOOK IX,Our hearts' desire!  Foul shame it were to abide
7241,BOOK IX,"Long deedless here and strengthless, womanlike!"
7242,BOOK IX,"Ere I be called war-blencher, let me die!"""
7243,BOOK IX,
7244,BOOK IX,Then unto Ares' work their spirits flamed.
7245,BOOK IX,"Down on the Trojans charged they: yea, and these"
7246,BOOK IX,"Fought with high courage, round their city now,"
7247,BOOK IX,And now from wall and gate-towers.  Never lulled
7248,BOOK IX,"The rage of war, while Trojan hearts were hot"
7249,BOOK IX,"To hurl the foemen back, and the strong Greeks"
7250,BOOK IX,To smite the town: grim havoc compassed all.
7251,BOOK IX,
7252,BOOK IX,"Then, eager for the Trojans' help, swooped down"
7253,BOOK IX,"Out of Olympus, cloaked about with clouds,"
7254,BOOK IX,The son of Leto.  Mighty rushing winds
7255,BOOK IX,Bare him in golden armour clad; and gleamed
7256,BOOK IX,With lightning-splendour of his descent the long
7257,BOOK IX,Highways of air.  His quiver clashed; loud rang
7258,BOOK IX,"The welkin; earth re-echoed, as he set"
7259,BOOK IX,His tireless feet by Xanthus.  Pealed his shout
7260,BOOK IX,"Dreadly, with courage filling them of Troy,"
7261,BOOK IX,Scaring their foes from biding the red fray.
7262,BOOK IX,But of all this the mighty Shaker of Earth
7263,BOOK IX,Was ware: he breathed into the fainting
7264,BOOK IX,"Greeks Fierce valour, and the fight waxed murderous"
7265,BOOK IX,Through those Immortals' clashing wills.  Then died
7266,BOOK IX,Hosts numberless on either side.  In wrath
7267,BOOK IX,Apollo thought to smite Achilles' son
7268,BOOK IX,In the same place where erst he smote his sire;
7269,BOOK IX,"But birds of boding screamed to left, to stay"
7270,BOOK IX,"His mood, and other signs from heaven were sent;"
7271,BOOK IX,Yet was his wrath not minded to obey
7272,BOOK IX,Those portents.  Swiftly drew Earth-shaker nigh
7273,BOOK IX,In mist celestial cloaked: about his feet
7274,BOOK IX,Quaked the dark earth as came the Sea-king on.
7275,BOOK IX,"Then, to stay Phoebus' hand, he cried to him:"
7276,BOOK IX,"""Refrain thy wrath: Achilles' giant son"
7277,BOOK IX,Slay not!  Olympus' Lord himself shall be
7278,BOOK IX,"Wroth for his death, and bitter grief shall light"
7279,BOOK IX,"On me and all the Sea-gods, as erstwhile"
7280,BOOK IX,"For Achilles' sake.  Nay, get thee back to heights"
7281,BOOK IX,"Celestial, lest thou kindle me to wrath,"
7282,BOOK IX,"And so I cleave a sudden chasm in earth,"
7283,BOOK IX,And Ilium and all her walls go down
7284,BOOK IX,"To darkness.  Thine own soul were vexed thereat."""
7285,BOOK IX,
7286,BOOK IX,"Then, overawed by the brother of his sire,"
7287,BOOK IX,"And fearing for Troy's fate and for her folk,"
7288,BOOK IX,"To heaven went back Apollo, to the sea"
7289,BOOK IX,"Poseidon.  But the sons of men fought on,"
7290,BOOK IX,And slew; and Strife incarnate gloating watched.
7291,BOOK IX,
7292,BOOK IX,At last by Calchas' counsel Achaea's sons
7293,BOOK IX,"Drew back to the ships, and put from them the thought"
7294,BOOK IX,"Of battle, seeing it was not foreordained"
7295,BOOK IX,That Ilium should fall until the might
7296,BOOK IX,Of war-wise Philoctetes came to aid
7297,BOOK IX,The Achaean host.  This had the prophet learnt.
7298,BOOK IX,"From birds of prosperous omen, or had read"
7299,BOOK IX,In hearts of victims.  Wise in prophecy-lore
7300,BOOK IX,"Was he, and like a God knew things to be."
7301,BOOK IX,
7302,BOOK IX,"Trusting in him, the sons of Atreus stayed"
7303,BOOK IX,"Awhile the war, and unto Lemnos, land"
7304,BOOK IX,"Of stately mansions, sent they Tydeus' son"
7305,BOOK IX,And battle-staunch Odysseus oversea.
7306,BOOK IX,Fast by the Fire-god's city sped they on
7307,BOOK IX,Over the broad flood of the Aegean Sea
7308,BOOK IX,"To vine-clad Lemnos, where in far-off days"
7309,BOOK IX,"The wives wreaked murderous vengeance on their lords,"
7310,BOOK IX,"In fierce wrath that they gave them not their due,"
7311,BOOK IX,"But couched beside the handmaid-thralls of Thrace,"
7312,BOOK IX,The captives of their spears when they laid waste
7313,BOOK IX,"The land of warrior Thracians.  Then these wives,"
7314,BOOK IX,"Their hearts with fiery jealousy's fever filled,"
7315,BOOK IX,Murdered in every home with merciless hands
7316,BOOK IX,Their husbands: no compassion would they show
7317,BOOK IX,To their own wedded lords--such madness shakes
7318,BOOK IX,"The heart of man or woman, when it burns"
7319,BOOK IX,"With jealousy's fever, stung by torturing pangs."
7320,BOOK IX,So with souls filled with desperate hardihood
7321,BOOK IX,In one night did they slaughter all their lords;
7322,BOOK IX,And on a widowed nation rose the sun.
7323,BOOK IX,
7324,BOOK IX,To hallowed Lemnos came those heroes twain;
7325,BOOK IX,They marked the rocky cave where lay the son
7326,BOOK IX,Of princely Poeas.  Horror came on them
7327,BOOK IX,When they beheld the hero of their quest
7328,BOOK IX,"Groaning with bitter pangs, on the hard earth"
7329,BOOK IX,"Lying, with many feathers round him strewn,"
7330,BOOK IX,"And others round his body, rudely sewn"
7331,BOOK IX,"Into a cloak, a screen from winter's cold."
7332,BOOK IX,"For, oft as famine stung him, would he shoot"
7333,BOOK IX,The shaft that missed no fowl his aim had doomed.
7334,BOOK IX,"Their flesh he ate, their feathers vestured him."
7335,BOOK IX,"And there lay herbs and healing leaves, the which,"
7336,BOOK IX,"Spread on his deadly wound, assuaged its pangs."
7337,BOOK IX,Wild tangled elf-locks hung about his head.
7338,BOOK IX,"He seemed a wild beast, that hath set its foot,"
7339,BOOK IX,"Prowling by night, upon a hidden trap,"
7340,BOOK IX,And so hath been constrained in agony
7341,BOOK IX,To bite with fierce teeth through the prisoned limb
7342,BOOK IX,"Ere it could win back to its cave, and there"
7343,BOOK IX,In hunger and torturing pains it languisheth.
7344,BOOK IX,So in that wide cave suffering crushed the man;
7345,BOOK IX,And all his frame was wasted: naught but skin
7346,BOOK IX,Covered his bones.  Unwashen there he crouched
7347,BOOK IX,"With famine-haggard cheeks, with sunken eyes"
7348,BOOK IX,Glaring his misery 'neath cavernous brows.
7349,BOOK IX,"Never his groaning ceased, for evermore"
7350,BOOK IX,"The ulcerous black wound, eating to the bone,"
7351,BOOK IX,Festered with thrills of agonizing pain.
7352,BOOK IX,"As when a beetling cliff, by seething seas"
7353,BOOK IX,"Aye buffeted, is carved and underscooped,"
7354,BOOK IX,"For all its stubborn strength, by tireless waves,"
7355,BOOK IX,"Till, scourged by winds and lashed by tempest-flails,"
7356,BOOK IX,The sea into deep caves hath gnawed its base;
7357,BOOK IX,So greater 'neath his foot grew evermore
7358,BOOK IX,"The festering wound, dealt when the envenomed fangs"
7359,BOOK IX,"Tare him of that fell water-snake, which men"
7360,BOOK IX,"Say dealeth ghastly wounds incurable,"
7361,BOOK IX,When the hot sun hath parched it as it crawls
7362,BOOK IX,Over the sands; and so that mightiest man
7363,BOOK IX,Lay faint and wasted with his cureless pain;
7364,BOOK IX,And from the ulcerous wound aye streamed to earth
7365,BOOK IX,Fetid corruption fouling all the floor
7366,BOOK IX,"Of that wide cave, a marvel to be heard"
7367,BOOK IX,Of men unborn.  Beside his stony bed
7368,BOOK IX,"Lay a long quiver full of arrows, some"
7369,BOOK IX,"For hunting, some to smite his foes withal;"
7370,BOOK IX,With deadly venom of that fell water-snake
7371,BOOK IX,"Were these besmeared.  Before it, nigh to his hand,"
7372,BOOK IX,"Lay the great bow, with curving tips of horn,"
7373,BOOK IX,Wrought by the mighty hands of Hercules.
7374,BOOK IX,
7375,BOOK IX,Now when that solitary spied these twain
7376,BOOK IX,"Draw nigh his cave, he sprang to his bow, he laid"
7377,BOOK IX,The deadly arrow on the string; for now
7378,BOOK IX,Fierce memory of his wrongs awoke against
7379,BOOK IX,"These, who had left him years agone, in pain"
7380,BOOK IX,Groaning upon the desolate sea-shore.
7381,BOOK IX,"Yea, and his heart's stem will he had swiftly wrought,"
7382,BOOK IX,"But, even as upon that godlike twain"
7383,BOOK IX,"He gazed, Athena caused his bitter wrath"
7384,BOOK IX,To melt away.  Then drew they nigh to him
7385,BOOK IX,"With looks of sad compassion, and sat down"
7386,BOOK IX,"On either hand beside him in the cave,"
7387,BOOK IX,And of his deadly wound and grievous pangs
7388,BOOK IX,Asked; and he told them all his sufferings.
7389,BOOK IX,And they spake hope and comfort; and they said:
7390,BOOK IX,"""Thy woeful wound, thine anguish, shall be healed,"
7391,BOOK IX,If thou but come with us to Achaea's host--
7392,BOOK IX,The host that now is sorrowing after thee
7393,BOOK IX,With all its kings.  And no man of them all
7394,BOOK IX,"Was cause of thine affliction, but the Fates,"
7395,BOOK IX,"The cruel ones, whom none that walk the earth"
7396,BOOK IX,"Escape, but aye they visit hapless men"
7397,BOOK IX,Unseen; and day by day with pitiless hearts
7398,BOOK IX,"Now they afflict men, now again exalt"
7399,BOOK IX,To honour--none knows why; for all the woes
7400,BOOK IX,And all the joys of men do these devise
7401,BOOK IX,"After their pleasure.""  Hearkening he sat"
7402,BOOK IX,To Odysseus and to godlike Diomede;
7403,BOOK IX,And all the hoarded wrath for olden wrongs
7404,BOOK IX,"And all the torturing rage, melted away."
7405,BOOK IX,
7406,BOOK IX,"Straight to the strand dull-thundering and the ship,"
7407,BOOK IX,"Laughing for joy, they bare him with his bow."
7408,BOOK IX,There washed they all his body and that foul wound
7409,BOOK IX,"With sponges, and with plenteous water bathed:"
7410,BOOK IX,So was his soul refreshed.  Then hasted they
7411,BOOK IX,"And made meat ready for the famished man,"
7412,BOOK IX,And in the galley supped with him.  Then came
7413,BOOK IX,"The balmy night, and sleep slid down on them."
7414,BOOK IX,Till rose the dawn they tarried by the strand
7415,BOOK IX,"Of sea-girt Lemnos, but with dayspring cast"
7416,BOOK IX,"The hawsers loose, and heaved the anchor-stones"
7417,BOOK IX,Out of the deep.  Athena sent a breeze
7418,BOOK IX,Blowing behind the galley taper-prowed.
7419,BOOK IX,They strained the sail with either stern-sheet taut;
7420,BOOK IX,Seaward they pointed the stout-girdered ship;
7421,BOOK IX,O'er the broad flood she leapt before the wind;
7422,BOOK IX,"Broken to right and left the dark wave sighed,"
7423,BOOK IX,"And seething all around was hoary foam,"
7424,BOOK IX,While thronging dolphins raced on either hand
7425,BOOK IX,Flashing along the paths of silver sea.
7426,BOOK IX,
7427,BOOK IX,Full soon to fish-fraught Hellespont they came
7428,BOOK IX,And the far-stretching ships.  Glad were the Greeks
7429,BOOK IX,To see the longed-for faces.  Forth the ship
7430,BOOK IX,With joy they stepped; and Poeas' valiant son
7431,BOOK IX,"On those two heroes leaned thin wasted hands,"
7432,BOOK IX,Who bare him painfully halting to the shore
7433,BOOK IX,Staying his weight upon their brawny arms.
7434,BOOK IX,As seems mid mountain-brakes an oak or pine
7435,BOOK IX,"By strength of the woodcutter half hewn through,"
7436,BOOK IX,Which for a little stands on what was left
7437,BOOK IX,Of the smooth trunk by him who hewed thereat
7438,BOOK IX,"Hard by the roots, that its slow-smouldering wood"
7439,BOOK IX,Might yield him pitch--now like to one in pain
7440,BOOK IX,"It groans, in weakness borne down by the wind,"
7441,BOOK IX,Yet is upstayed upon its leafy boughs
7442,BOOK IX,Which from the earth bear up its helpless weight;
7443,BOOK IX,So by pain unendurable bowed down
7444,BOOK IX,"Leaned he on those brave heroes, and was borne"
7445,BOOK IX,"Unto the war-host.  Men beheld, and all"
7446,BOOK IX,"Compassionated that great archer, crushed"
7447,BOOK IX,"By anguish of his hurt.  But one drew near,"
7448,BOOK IX,"Podaleirius, godlike in his power to heal."
7449,BOOK IX,Swifter than thought he made him whole and sound;
7450,BOOK IX,"For deftly on the wound he spread his salves,"
7451,BOOK IX,Calling on his physician-father's name;
7452,BOOK IX,"And soon the Achaeans shouted all for joy,"
7453,BOOK IX,All praising with one voice Asclepius' son.
7454,BOOK IX,"Lovingly then they bathed him, and with oil"
7455,BOOK IX,Anointed.  All his heaviness of cheer
7456,BOOK IX,And misery vanished by the Immortals' will;
7457,BOOK IX,And glad at heart were all that looked on him;
7458,BOOK IX,And from affliction he awoke to joy.
7459,BOOK IX,Over the bloodless face the flush of health
7460,BOOK IX,"Glowed, and for wretched weakness mighty strength"
7461,BOOK IX,Thrilled through him: goodly and great waxed all his limbs.
7462,BOOK IX,As when a field of corn revives again
7463,BOOK IX,"Which erst had drooped, by rains of ruining storm"
7464,BOOK IX,"Down beaten flat, but by warm summer winds"
7465,BOOK IX,"Requickened, o'er the laboured land it smiles,"
7466,BOOK IX,So Philoctetes' erstwhile wasted frame
7467,BOOK IX,Was all requickened:--in the galley's hold
7468,BOOK IX,He seemed to have left all cares that crushed his soul.
7469,BOOK IX,
7470,BOOK IX,And Atreus' sons beheld him marvelling
7471,BOOK IX,As one re-risen from the dead: it seemed
7472,BOOK IX,The work of hands immortal.  And indeed
7473,BOOK IX,"So was it verily, as their hearts divined;"
7474,BOOK IX,For 'twas the glorious Trito-born that shed
7475,BOOK IX,Stature and grace upon him.  Suddenly
7476,BOOK IX,He seemed as when of old mid Argive men
7477,BOOK IX,"He stood, before calamity struck him down."
7478,BOOK IX,Then unto wealthy Agamemnon's tent
7479,BOOK IX,"Did all their mightiest men bring Poeas' son,"
7480,BOOK IX,"And set him chief in honour at the feast,"
7481,BOOK IX,Extolling him.  When all with meat and drink
7482,BOOK IX,"Were filled, spake Agamemnon lord of spears:"
7483,BOOK IX,"""Dear friend, since by the will of Heaven our souls"
7484,BOOK IX,"Were once perverted, that in sea-girt Lemnos"
7485,BOOK IX,"We left thee, harbour not thine heart within"
7486,BOOK IX,Fierce wrath for this: by the blest Gods constrained
7487,BOOK IX,"We did it; and, I trow, the Immortals willed"
7488,BOOK IX,"To bring much evil on us, bereft of thee,"
7489,BOOK IX,Who art of all men skilfullest to quell
7490,BOOK IX,With shafts of death all foes that face thee in fight.
7491,BOOK IX,"For all the tangled paths of human life,"
7492,BOOK IX,"By land and sea, are by the will of Fate"
7493,BOOK IX,"Hid from our eyes, in many and devious tracks"
7494,BOOK IX,"Are cleft apart, in wandering mazes lost."
7495,BOOK IX,Along them men by Fortune's dooming drift
7496,BOOK IX,Like unto leaves that drive before the wind.
7497,BOOK IX,Oft on an evil path the good man's feet
7498,BOOK IX,"Stumble, the brave finds not a prosperous path;"
7499,BOOK IX,"And none of earth-born men can shun the Fates,"
7500,BOOK IX,And of his own will none can choose his way.
7501,BOOK IX,So then doth it behove the wise of heart
7502,BOOK IX,Though on a troublous track the winds of fate
7503,BOOK IX,Sweep him away to suffer and be strong.
7504,BOOK IX,"Since we were blinded then, and erred herein,"
7505,BOOK IX,With rich gifts will we make amends to thee
7506,BOOK IX,"Hereafter, when we take the stately towers"
7507,BOOK IX,"Of Troy: but now receive thou handmaids seven,"
7508,BOOK IX,"Fleet steeds two-score, victors in chariot-race,"
7509,BOOK IX,"And tripods twelve, wherein thine heart may joy"
7510,BOOK IX,Through all thy days; and always in my tent
7511,BOOK IX,"Shall royal honour at the feast be thine."""
7512,BOOK IX,
7513,BOOK IX,"He spake, and gave the hero those fair gifts."
7514,BOOK IX,Then answered Poeas' mighty-hearted son;
7515,BOOK IX,"""Friend, I forgive thee freely, and all beside"
7516,BOOK IX,Whoso against me haply hath trangressed.
7517,BOOK IX,I know how good men's minds sometimes be warped:
7518,BOOK IX,Nor meet it is that one be obdurate
7519,BOOK IX,"Ever, and nurse mean rancours: sternest wrath"
7520,BOOK IX,Must yield anon unto the melting mood.
7521,BOOK IX,Now pass we to our rest; for better is sleep
7522,BOOK IX,"Than feasting late, for him who longs to fight."""
7523,BOOK IX,
7524,BOOK IX,"He spake, and rose, and came to his comrades' tent;"
7525,BOOK IX,Then swiftly for their war-fain king they dight
7526,BOOK IX,"The couch, while laughed their hearts for very joy."
7527,BOOK IX,Gladly he laid him down to sleep till dawn.
7528,BOOK IX,
7529,BOOK IX,"So passed the night divine, till flushed the hills"
7530,BOOK IX,"In the sun's light, and men awoke to toil."
7531,BOOK IX,Then all athirst for war the Argive men
7532,BOOK IX,"'Gan whet the spear smooth-shafted, or the dart,"
7533,BOOK IX,"Or javelin, and they brake the bread of dawn,"
7534,BOOK IX,And foddered all their horses.  Then to these
7535,BOOK IX,Spake Poeas' son with battle-kindling speech:
7536,BOOK IX,"""Up!  let us make us ready for the war!"
7537,BOOK IX,"Let no man linger mid the galleys, ere"
7538,BOOK IX,The glorious walls of Ilium stately-towered
7539,BOOK IX,"Be shattered, and her palaces be burned!"""
7540,BOOK IX,
7541,BOOK IX,Then at his words each heart and spirit glowed:
7542,BOOK IX,"They donned their armour, and they grasped their shields."
7543,BOOK IX,Forth of the ships in one huge mass they poured
7544,BOOK IX,"Arrayed with bull-hide bucklers, ashen spears,"
7545,BOOK IX,And gallant-crested helms.  Through all their ranks
7546,BOOK IX,Shoulder to shoulder marched they: thou hadst seen
7547,BOOK IX,No gap 'twixt man and man as on they charged;
7548,BOOK IX,"So close they thronged, so dense was their array."
7549,BOOK IX,
7550,BOOK IX,
7551,BOOK IX,
7552,BOOK X,BOOK X
7553,BOOK X,
7554,BOOK X,"How Paris was stricken to death, and in vain sought help of Oenone."
7555,BOOK X,
7556,BOOK X,
7557,BOOK X,Now were the Trojans all without the town
7558,BOOK X,"Of Priam, armour-clad, with battle-cars"
7559,BOOK X,"And chariot-steeds; for still they burnt their dead,"
7560,BOOK X,And still they feared lest the Achaean men
7561,BOOK X,"Should fall on them. They looked, and saw them come"
7562,BOOK X,With furious speed against the walls. In haste
7563,BOOK X,"They cast a hurried earth-mound o'er the slain,"
7564,BOOK X,For greatly trembled they to see their foes.
7565,BOOK X,Then in their sore disquiet spake to them
7566,BOOK X,"Polydamas, a wise and prudent chief:"
7567,BOOK X,"""Friends, unendurably against us now"
7568,BOOK X,"Maddens the war.  Go to, let us devise"
7569,BOOK X,How we may find deliverance from our strait.
7570,BOOK X,"Still bide the Danaans here, still gather strength:"
7571,BOOK X,"Now therefore let us man our stately towers,"
7572,BOOK X,"And thence withstand them, fighting night and day,"
7573,BOOK X,"Until yon Danaans weary, and return"
7574,BOOK X,"To Sparta, or, renownless lingering here"
7575,BOOK X,"Beside the wall, lose heart.  No strength of theirs"
7576,BOOK X,"Shall breach the long walls, howsoe'er they strive,"
7577,BOOK X,For in the imperishable work of Gods
7578,BOOK X,"Weakness is none.  Food, drink, we shall not lack,"
7579,BOOK X,For in King Priam's gold-abounding halls
7580,BOOK X,"Is stored abundant food, that shall suffice"
7581,BOOK X,"For many more than we, through many years,"
7582,BOOK X,Though thrice so great a host at our desire
7583,BOOK X,"Should gather, eager to maintain our cause."""
7584,BOOK X,
7585,BOOK X,Then chode with him Anchises' valiant son:
7586,BOOK X,"""Polydamas, wherefore do they call thee wise,"
7587,BOOK X,Who biddest suffer endless tribulations
7588,BOOK X,"Cooped within walls?  Never, how long soe'er"
7589,BOOK X,"The Achaeans tarry here, will they lose heart;"
7590,BOOK X,"But when they see us skulking from the field,"
7591,BOOK X,More fiercely will press on.  So ours shall be
7592,BOOK X,"The sufferance, perishing in our native home,"
7593,BOOK X,If for long season they beleaguer us.
7594,BOOK X,"No food, if we be pent within our walls,"
7595,BOOK X,"Shall Thebe send us, nor Maeonia wine,"
7596,BOOK X,"But wretchedly by famine shall we die,"
7597,BOOK X,"Though the great wall stand firm.  Nay, though our lot"
7598,BOOK X,"Should be to escape that evil death and doom,"
7599,BOOK X,And not by famine miserably to die;
7600,BOOK X,Yet rather let us fight in armour clad
7601,BOOK X,For children and grey fathers!  Haply Zeus
7602,BOOK X,Will help us yet; of his high blood are we.
7603,BOOK X,"Nay, even though we be abhorred of him,"
7604,BOOK X,Better straightway to perish gloriously
7605,BOOK X,"Fighting unto the last for fatherland,"
7606,BOOK X,"Than die a death of lingering agony!"""
7607,BOOK X,
7608,BOOK X,Shouted they all who heard that gallant rede.
7609,BOOK X,Swiftly with helms and shields and spears they stood
7610,BOOK X,In close array.  The eyes of mighty Zeus
7611,BOOK X,From heaven beheld the Trojans armed for fight
7612,BOOK X,Against the Danaans: then did he awake
7613,BOOK X,"Courage in these and those, that there might be"
7614,BOOK X,Strain of unflinching fight 'twixt host and host.
7615,BOOK X,"That day was Paris doomed, for Helen's sake"
7616,BOOK X,"Fighting, by Philoctetes' hands to die."
7617,BOOK X,
7618,BOOK X,"To one place Strife incarnate drew them all,"
7619,BOOK X,"The fearful Battle-queen, beheld of none,"
7620,BOOK X,But cloaked in clouds blood-raining: on she stalked
7621,BOOK X,"Swelling the mighty roar of battle, now"
7622,BOOK X,"Rushed through Troy's squadrons, through Achaea's now;"
7623,BOOK X,Panic and Fear still waited on her steps
7624,BOOK X,To make their father's sister glorious.
7625,BOOK X,From small to huge that Fury's stature grew;
7626,BOOK X,"Her arms of adamant were blood-besprent,"
7627,BOOK X,The deadly lance she brandished reached the sky.
7628,BOOK X,Earth quaked beneath her feet: dread blasts of fire
7629,BOOK X,Flamed from her mouth: her voice pealed thunder-like
7630,BOOK X,Kindling strong men.  Swift closed the fronts of fight
7631,BOOK X,Drawn by a dread Power to the mighty work.
7632,BOOK X,Loud as the shriek of winds that madly blow
7633,BOOK X,"In early spring, when the tall woodland trees"
7634,BOOK X,Put forth their leaves--loud as the roar of fire
7635,BOOK X,Blazing through sun-scorched brakes--loud as the voice
7636,BOOK X,"Of many waters, when the wide sea raves"
7637,BOOK X,"Beneath the howling blast, with thunderous crash"
7638,BOOK X,"Of waves, when shake the fearful shipman's knees;"
7639,BOOK X,So thundered earth beneath their charging feet.
7640,BOOK X,Strife swooped on them: foe hurled himself on foe.
7641,BOOK X,
7642,BOOK X,First did Aeneas of the Danaans slay
7643,BOOK X,"Harpalion, Arizelus' scion, born"
7644,BOOK X,"In far Boeotia of Amphinome,"
7645,BOOK X,Who came to Troy to help the Argive men
7646,BOOK X,With godlike Prothoenor.  'Neath his waist
7647,BOOK X,"Aeneas stabbed, and reft sweet life from him."
7648,BOOK X,"Dead upon him he cast Thersander's son,"
7649,BOOK X,For the barbed javelin pierced through Hyllus' throat
7650,BOOK X,Whom Arethusa by Lethaeus bare
7651,BOOK X,In Crete: sore grieved Idomeneus for his fall.
7652,BOOK X,
7653,BOOK X,By this Peleides' son had swiftly slain
7654,BOOK X,Twelve Trojan warriors with his father's spear.
7655,BOOK X,"First Cebrus fell, Harmon, Pasitheus then,"
7656,BOOK X,"Hysminus, Schedius, and Imbrasius,"
7657,BOOK X,"Phleges, Mnesaeus, Ennomus, Amphinous,"
7658,BOOK X,"Phasis, Galenus last, who had his home"
7659,BOOK X,
7660,BOOK X,By Gargarus' steep--a mighty warrior he
7661,BOOK X,Among Troy's mighties: with a countless host
7662,BOOK X,To Troy he came: for Priam Dardanus' son
7663,BOOK X,Promised him many gifts and passing fair.
7664,BOOK X,"Ah fool!  his own doom never he foresaw,"
7665,BOOK X,Whose weird was suddenly to fall in fight
7666,BOOK X,Ere he bore home King Priam's glorious gifts.
7667,BOOK X,
7668,BOOK X,Doom the Destroyer against the Argives sped
7669,BOOK X,"Valiant Aeneas' friend, Eurymenes."
7670,BOOK X,"Wild courage spurred him on, that he might slay"
7671,BOOK X,Many--and then fill death's cup for himself.
7672,BOOK X,"Man after man he slew like some fierce beast,"
7673,BOOK X,And foes shrank from the terrible rage that burned
7674,BOOK X,"On his life's verge, nor reeked of imminent doom."
7675,BOOK X,"Yea, peerless deeds in that fight had he done,"
7676,BOOK X,"Had not his hands grown weary, his spear-head"
7677,BOOK X,"Bent utterly: his sword availed him not,"
7678,BOOK X,Snapped at the hilt by Fate.  Then Meges' dart
7679,BOOK X,"Smote 'neath his ribs; blood spurted from his mouth,"
7680,BOOK X,And in death's agony Doom stood at his side.
7681,BOOK X,
7682,BOOK X,"Even as he fell, Epeius' henchmen twain,"
7683,BOOK X,"Deileon and Amphion, rushed to strip"
7684,BOOK X,His armour; but Aeneas brave and strong
7685,BOOK X,Chilled their hot hearts in death beside the dead.
7686,BOOK X,As one in latter summer 'mid his vines
7687,BOOK X,"Kills wasps that dart about his ripening grapes,"
7688,BOOK X,"And so, ere they may taste the fruit, they die;"
7689,BOOK X,"So smote he them, ere they could seize the arms."
7690,BOOK X,
7691,BOOK X,"Menon and Amphinous Tydeides slew,"
7692,BOOK X,Both goodly men.  Paris slew Hippasus' son
7693,BOOK X,"Demoleon, who in Laconia's land"
7694,BOOK X,"Beside the outfall of Eurotas dwelt,"
7695,BOOK X,"The stream deep-flowing, and to Troy he came"
7696,BOOK X,With Menelaus.  Under his right breast
7697,BOOK X,"The shaft of Paris smote him unto death,"
7698,BOOK X,Driving his soul forth like a scattering breath.
7699,BOOK X,
7700,BOOK X,"Teucer slew Zechis, Medon's war-famed son,"
7701,BOOK X,"Who dwelt in Phrygia, land of myriad flocks,"
7702,BOOK X,Below that haunted cave of fair-haired Nymphs
7703,BOOK X,"Where, as Endymion slept beside his kine,"
7704,BOOK X,"Divine Selene watched him from on high,"
7705,BOOK X,And slid from heaven to earth; for passionate love
7706,BOOK X,Drew down the immortal stainless Queen of Night.
7707,BOOK X,And a memorial of her couch abides
7708,BOOK X,Still 'neath the oaks; for mid the copses round
7709,BOOK X,Was poured out milk of kine; and still do men
7710,BOOK X,Marvelling behold its whiteness.  Thou wouldst say
7711,BOOK X,"Far off that this was milk indeed, which is"
7712,BOOK X,A well-spring of white water: if thou draw
7713,BOOK X,"A little nigher, lo, the stream is fringed"
7714,BOOK X,"As though with ice, for white stone rims it round."
7715,BOOK X,
7716,BOOK X,"Rushed on Alcaeus Meges, Phyleus' son,"
7717,BOOK X,And drave his spear beneath his fluttering heart.
7718,BOOK X,"Loosed were the cords of sweet life suddenly,"
7719,BOOK X,And his sad parents longed in vain to greet
7720,BOOK X,That son returning from the woeful war
7721,BOOK X,"To Margasus and Phyllis lovely-girt,"
7722,BOOK X,"Dwellers by lucent streams of Harpasus,"
7723,BOOK X,Who pours the full blood of his clamorous flow
7724,BOOK X,Into Maeander madly rushing aye.
7725,BOOK X,
7726,BOOK X,With Glaucus' warrior-comrade Scylaceus
7727,BOOK X,"Odeus' son closed in the fight, and stabbed"
7728,BOOK X,"Over the shield-rim, and the cruel spear"
7729,BOOK X,"Passed through his shoulder, and drenched his shield with blood."
7730,BOOK X,"Howbeit he slew him not, whose day of doom"
7731,BOOK X,Awaited him afar beside the wall
7732,BOOK X,Of his own city; for when Illium's towers
7733,BOOK X,Were brought low by that swift avenging host
7734,BOOK X,Fleeing the war to Lycia then he came
7735,BOOK X,"Alone; and when he drew nigh to the town,"
7736,BOOK X,The thronging women met and questioned him
7737,BOOK X,Touching their sons and husbands; and he told
7738,BOOK X,"How all were dead. They compassed him about,"
7739,BOOK X,"And stoned the man with great stones, that he died."
7740,BOOK X,"So had he no joy of his winning home,"
7741,BOOK X,"But the stones muffled up his dying groans,"
7742,BOOK X,And of the same his ghastly tomb was reared
7743,BOOK X,Beside Bellerophon's grave and holy place
7744,BOOK X,"In Tlos, nigh that far-famed Chimaera's Crag."
7745,BOOK X,"Yet, though he thus fulfilled his day of doom,"
7746,BOOK X,As a God afterward men worshipped him
7747,BOOK X,"By Phoebus' hest, and never his honour fades."
7748,BOOK X,
7749,BOOK X,Now Poeas' son the while slew Deioneus
7750,BOOK X,"And Acamas, Antenor's warrior son:"
7751,BOOK X,"Yea, a great host of strong men laid he low."
7752,BOOK X,"On, like the War-god, through his foes he rushed,"
7753,BOOK X,Or as a river roaring in full flood
7754,BOOK X,"Breaks down long dykes, when, maddening round its rocks,"
7755,BOOK X,Down from the mountains swelled by rain it pours
7756,BOOK X,An ever-flowing mightily-rushing stream
7757,BOOK X,Whose foaming crests over its forelands sweep;
7758,BOOK X,So none who saw him even from afar
7759,BOOK X,"Dared meet renowned Poeas' valiant son,"
7760,BOOK X,"Whose breast with battle-fury was fulfilled,"
7761,BOOK X,Whose limbs were clad in mighty Hercules' arms
7762,BOOK X,Of cunning workmanship; for on the belt
7763,BOOK X,"Gleamed bears most grim and savage, jackals fell,"
7764,BOOK X,"And panthers, in whose eyes there seems to lurk"
7765,BOOK X,"A deadly smile.  There were fierce-hearted wolves,"
7766,BOOK X,"And boars with flashing tusks, and mighty lions"
7767,BOOK X,"All seeming strangely alive; and, there portrayed"
7768,BOOK X,"Through all its breadth, were battles murder-rife."
7769,BOOK X,With all these marvels covered was the belt;
7770,BOOK X,And with yet more the quiver was adorned.
7771,BOOK X,"There Hermes was, storm-footed Son of Zeus,"
7772,BOOK X,"Slaying huge Argus nigh to Inachus' streams,"
7773,BOOK X,"Argus, whose sentinel eyes in turn took sleep."
7774,BOOK X,And there was Phaethon from the Sun-car hurled
7775,BOOK X,Into Eridanus.  Earth verily seemed
7776,BOOK X,"Ablaze, and black smoke hovered on the air."
7777,BOOK X,There Perseus slew Medusa gorgon-eyed
7778,BOOK X,By the stars' baths and utmost bounds of earth
7779,BOOK X,"And fountains of deep-flowing Ocean, where"
7780,BOOK X,Night in the far west meets the setting sun.
7781,BOOK X,There was the Titan Iapetus' great son
7782,BOOK X,Hung from the beetling crag of Caucasus
7783,BOOK X,"In bonds of adamant, and the eagle tare"
7784,BOOK X,His liver unconsumed--he seemed to groan!
7785,BOOK X,All these Hephaestus' cunning hands had wrought
7786,BOOK X,"For Hercules; and these to Poeas' son,"
7787,BOOK X,"Most near of friends and dear, he gave to bear."
7788,BOOK X,
7789,BOOK X,So glorying in those arms he smote the foe.
7790,BOOK X,But Paris at the last to meet him sprang
7791,BOOK X,"Fearlessly, bearing in his hands his bow"
7792,BOOK X,And deadly arrows--but his latest day
7793,BOOK X,Now met himself.  A flying shaft he sped
7794,BOOK X,"Forth from the string, which sang as leapt the dart,"
7795,BOOK X,Which flew not vainly: yet the very mark
7796,BOOK X,"It missed, for Philoctetes swerved aside"
7797,BOOK X,"A hair-breadth, and it smote above the breast"
7798,BOOK X,"Cleodorus war-renowned, and cleft a path"
7799,BOOK X,Clear through his shoulder; for he had not now
7800,BOOK X,The buckler broad which wont to fence from death
7801,BOOK X,"Its bearer, but was falling back from fight,"
7802,BOOK X,Being shieldless; for Polydamas' massy lance
7803,BOOK X,Had cleft the shoulder-belt whereby his targe
7804,BOOK X,"Hung, and he gave back therefore, fighting still"
7805,BOOK X,With stubborn spear.  But now the arrow of death
7806,BOOK X,"Fell on him, as from ambush leaping forth."
7807,BOOK X,"For so Fate willed, I trow, to bring dread doom"
7808,BOOK X,"On noble-hearted Lernus' scion, born"
7809,BOOK X,"Of Amphiale, in Rhodes the fertile land."
7810,BOOK X,
7811,BOOK X,But soon as Poeas' battle-eager son
7812,BOOK X,"Marked him by Paris' deadly arrow slain,"
7813,BOOK X,"Swiftly he strained his bow, shouting aloud:"
7814,BOOK X,"""Dog!  I will give thee death, will speed thee down"
7815,BOOK X,"To the Unseen Land, who darest to brave me!"
7816,BOOK X,"And so shall they have rest, who travail now"
7817,BOOK X,For thy vile sake.  Destruction shall have end
7818,BOOK X,"When thou art dead, the author of our bane."""
7819,BOOK X,
7820,BOOK X,Then to his breast he drew the plaited cord.
7821,BOOK X,"The great bow arched, the merciless shaft was aimed"
7822,BOOK X,"Straight, and the terrible point a little peered"
7823,BOOK X,"Above the bow, in that constraining grip."
7824,BOOK X,"Loud sang the string, as the death-hissing shaft"
7825,BOOK X,"Leapt, and missed not: yet was not Paris' heart"
7826,BOOK X,"Stilled, but his spirit yet was strong in him;"
7827,BOOK X,For that first arrow was not winged with death:
7828,BOOK X,It did but graze the fair flesh by his wrist.
7829,BOOK X,"Then once again the avenger drew the bow,"
7830,BOOK X,"And the barbed shaft of Poeas' son had plunged,"
7831,BOOK X,"Ere he could swerve, 'twixt flank and groin.  No more"
7832,BOOK X,"He abode the fight, but swiftly hasted back"
7833,BOOK X,As hastes a dog which on a lion rushed
7834,BOOK X,"At first, then fleeth terror-stricken back."
7835,BOOK X,"So he, his very heart with agony thrilled,"
7836,BOOK X,"Fled from the war.  Still clashed the grappling hosts,"
7837,BOOK X,Man slaying man: aye bloodier waxed the fray
7838,BOOK X,As rained the blows: corpse upon corpse was flung
7839,BOOK X,"Confusedly, like thunder-drops, or flakes"
7840,BOOK X,"Of snow, or hailstones, by the wintry blast"
7841,BOOK X,At Zeus' behest strewn over the long hills
7842,BOOK X,And forest-boughs; so by a pitiless doom
7843,BOOK X,"Slain, friends with foes in heaps on heaps were strown."
7844,BOOK X,
7845,BOOK X,Sorely groaned Paris; with the torturing wound
7846,BOOK X,Fainted his spirit.  Leeches sought to allay
7847,BOOK X,His frenzy of pain.  But now drew back to Troy
7848,BOOK X,"The Trojans, and the Danaans to their ships"
7849,BOOK X,"Swiftly returned, for dark night put an end"
7850,BOOK X,"To strife, and stole from men's limbs weariness,"
7851,BOOK X,Pouring upon their eyes pain-healing sleep.
7852,BOOK X,
7853,BOOK X,But through the livelong night no sleep laid hold
7854,BOOK X,"On Paris: for his help no leech availed,"
7855,BOOK X,"Though ne'er so willing, with his salves.  His weird"
7856,BOOK X,Was only by Oenone's hands to escape
7857,BOOK X,"Death's doom, if so she willed.  Now he obeyed"
7858,BOOK X,"The prophecy, and he went--exceeding loth,"
7859,BOOK X,"But grim necessity forced him thence, to face"
7860,BOOK X,The wife forsaken.  Evil-boding fowl
7861,BOOK X,"Shrieked o'er his head, or darted past to left,"
7862,BOOK X,"Still as he went.  Now, as he looked at them,"
7863,BOOK X,"His heart sank; now hope whispered, ""Haply vain"
7864,BOOK X,"Their bodings are!"" but on their wings were borne"
7865,BOOK X,Visions of doom that blended with his pain.
7866,BOOK X,Into Oenone's presence thus he came.
7867,BOOK X,Amazed her thronging handmaids looked on him
7868,BOOK X,As at the Nymph's feet that pale suppliant fell
7869,BOOK X,"Faint with the anguish of his wound, whose pangs"
7870,BOOK X,"Stabbed him through brain and heart, yea, quivered through"
7871,BOOK X,"His very bones, for that fierce venom crawled"
7872,BOOK X,Through all his inwards with corrupting fangs;
7873,BOOK X,And his life fainted in him agony-thrilled.
7874,BOOK X,As one with sickness and tormenting thirst
7875,BOOK X,"Consumed, lies parched, with heart quick-shuddering,"
7876,BOOK X,"With liver seething as in flame, the soul,"
7877,BOOK X,"Scarce conscious, fluttering at his burning lips,"
7878,BOOK X,"Longing for life, for water longing sore;"
7879,BOOK X,So was his breast one fire of torturing pain.
7880,BOOK X,Then in exceeding feebleness he spake:
7881,BOOK X,"""O reverenced wife, turn not from me in hate"
7882,BOOK X,For that I left thee widowed long ago!
7883,BOOK X,Not of my will I did it: the strong Fates
7884,BOOK X,Dragged me to Helen--oh that I had died
7885,BOOK X,Ere I embraced her--in thine arms had died!
7886,BOOK X,"All, by the Gods I pray, the Lords of Heaven,"
7887,BOOK X,"By all the memories of our wedded love,"
7888,BOOK X,Be merciful!  Banish my bitter pain:
7889,BOOK X,Lay on my deadly wound those healing salves
7890,BOOK X,"Which only can, by Fate's decree, remove"
7891,BOOK X,"This torment, if thou wilt.  Thine heart must speak"
7892,BOOK X,"My sentence, to be saved from death or no."
7893,BOOK X,"Pity me--oh, make haste to pity me!"
7894,BOOK X,This venom's might is swiftly bringing death!
7895,BOOK X,"Heal me, while life yet lingers in my limbs!"
7896,BOOK X,"Remember not those pangs of jealousy,"
7897,BOOK X,Nor leave me by a cruel doom to die
7898,BOOK X,Low fallen at thy feet!  This should offend
7899,BOOK X,"The Prayers, the Daughters of the Thunderer Zeus,"
7900,BOOK X,Whose anger followeth unrelenting pride
7901,BOOK X,"With vengeance, and the Erinnys executes"
7902,BOOK X,"Their wrath.  My queen, I sinned, in folly sinned;"
7903,BOOK X,"Yet from death save me--oh, make haste to save!"""
7904,BOOK X,
7905,BOOK X,So prayed he; but her darkly-brooding heart
7906,BOOK X,"Was steeled, and her words mocked his agony:"
7907,BOOK X,"""Thou comest unto me!--thou, who didst leave"
7908,BOOK X,Erewhile a wailing wife in a desolate home!--
7909,BOOK X,"Didst leave her for thy Tyndarid darling!  Go,"
7910,BOOK X,Lie laughing in her arms for bliss!  She is better
7911,BOOK X,"Than thy true wife--is, rumour saith, immortal!"
7912,BOOK X,Make haste to kneel to her but not to me!
7913,BOOK X,"Weep not to me, nor whimper pitiful prayers!"
7914,BOOK X,"Oh that mine heart beat with a tigress' strength,"
7915,BOOK X,That I might tear thy flesh and lap thy blood
7916,BOOK X,For all the pain thy folly brought on me!
7917,BOOK X,Vile wretch!  where now is Love's Queen glory-crowned?
7918,BOOK X,Hath Zeus forgotten his daughter's paramour?
7919,BOOK X,Have them for thy deliverers!  Get thee hence
7920,BOOK X,"Far from my dwelling, curse of Gods and men!"
7921,BOOK X,"Yea, for through thee, thou miscreant, sorrow came"
7922,BOOK X,"On deathless Gods, for sons and sons' sons slain."
7923,BOOK X,Hence from my threshold!--to thine Helen go!
7924,BOOK X,Agonize day and night beside her bed:
7925,BOOK X,"There whimper, pierced to the heart with cruel pangs,"
7926,BOOK X,"Until she heal thee of thy grievous pain."""
7927,BOOK X,
7928,BOOK X,So from her doors she drave that groaning man--
7929,BOOK X,"Ah fool!  not knowing her own doom, whose weird"
7930,BOOK X,Was straightway after him to tread the path
7931,BOOK X,Of death!  So Fate had spun her destiny-thread.
7932,BOOK X,
7933,BOOK X,"Then, as he stumbled down through Ida's brakes,"
7934,BOOK X,Where Doom on his death-path was leading him
7935,BOOK X,"Painfully halting, racked with heart-sick pain,"
7936,BOOK X,"Hera beheld him, with rejoicing soul"
7937,BOOK X,Throned in the Olympian palace-court of Zeus.
7938,BOOK X,And seated at her side were handmaids four
7939,BOOK X,Whom radiant-faced Selene bare to the Sun
7940,BOOK X,"To be unwearying ministers in Heaven,"
7941,BOOK X,In form and office diverse each from each;
7942,BOOK X,"For of these Seasons one was summer's queen,"
7943,BOOK X,"And one of winter and his stormy star,"
7944,BOOK X,"Of spring the third, of autumn-tide the fourth."
7945,BOOK X,So in four portions parted is man's year
7946,BOOK X,Ruled by these Queens in turn--but of all this
7947,BOOK X,Be Zeus himself the Overseer in heaven.
7948,BOOK X,And of those issues now these spake with her
7949,BOOK X,Which baleful Fate in her all-ruining heart
7950,BOOK X,Was shaping to the birth the new espousals
7951,BOOK X,"Of Helen, fatal to Deiphobus--"
7952,BOOK X,"The wrath of Helenus, who hoped in vain"
7953,BOOK X,"For that fair bride, and how, when he had fled,"
7954,BOOK X,"Wroth with the Trojans, to the mountain-height,"
7955,BOOK X,Achaea's sons would seize him and would hale
7956,BOOK X,"Unto their ships--how, by his counselling"
7957,BOOK X,Strong Tydeus' son should with Odysseus scale
7958,BOOK X,"The great wall, and should slay Alcathous"
7959,BOOK X,"The temple-warder, and should bear away"
7960,BOOK X,"Pallas the Gracious, with her free consent,"
7961,BOOK X,Whose image was the sure defence of Troy;--
7962,BOOK X,"Yea, for not even a God, how wroth soe'er,"
7963,BOOK X,Had power to lay the City of Priam waste
7964,BOOK X,While that immortal shape stood warder there.
7965,BOOK X,"No man had carven that celestial form,"
7966,BOOK X,But Cronos' Son himself had cast it down
7967,BOOK X,From heaven to Priam's gold-abounding burg.
7968,BOOK X,
7969,BOOK X,Of these things with her handmaids did the Queen
7970,BOOK X,"Of Heaven hold converse, and of many such,"
7971,BOOK X,"But Paris, while they talked, gave up the ghost"
7972,BOOK X,On Ida: never Helen saw him more.
7973,BOOK X,Loud wailed the Nymphs around him; for they still
7974,BOOK X,Remembered how their nursling wont to lisp
7975,BOOK X,"His childish prattle, compassed with their smiles."
7976,BOOK X,"And with them mourned the neatherds light of foot,"
7977,BOOK X,Sorrowful-hearted; moaned the mountain-glens.
7978,BOOK X,
7979,BOOK X,Then unto travail-burdened Priam's queen
7980,BOOK X,A herdman told the dread doom of her son.
7981,BOOK X,Wildly her trembling heart leapt when she heard;
7982,BOOK X,With failing limbs she sank to earth and wailed:
7983,BOOK X,"""Dead!  thou dead, O dear child!  Grief heaped on grief"
7984,BOOK X,"Hast thou bequeathed me, grief eternal!  Best"
7985,BOOK X,"Of all my sons, save Hector alone, wast thou!"
7986,BOOK X,"While beats my heart, my grief shall weep for thee."
7987,BOOK X,The hand of Heaven is in our sufferings:
7988,BOOK X,Some Fate devised our ruin--oh that I
7989,BOOK X,"Had lived not to endure it, but had died"
7990,BOOK X,In days of wealthy peace!  But now I see
7991,BOOK X,"Woes upon woes, and ever look to see"
7992,BOOK X,"Worse things--my children slain, my city sacked"
7993,BOOK X,"And burned with fire by stony-hearted foes,"
7994,BOOK X,"Daughters, sons' wives, all Trojan women, haled"
7995,BOOK X,"Into captivity with our little ones!"""
7996,BOOK X,
7997,BOOK X,"So wailed she; but the King heard naught thereof,"
7998,BOOK X,"But weeping ever sat by Hector's grave,"
7999,BOOK X,"For most of all his sons he honoured him,"
8000,BOOK X,"His mightiest, the defender of his land."
8001,BOOK X,Nothing of Paris knew that pierced heart;
8002,BOOK X,But long and loud lamented Helen; yet
8003,BOOK X,Those wails were but for Trojan ears; her soul
8004,BOOK X,"With other thoughts was busy, as she cried:"
8005,BOOK X,"""Husband, to me, to Troy, and to thyself"
8006,BOOK X,A bitter blow is this thy woeful death!
8007,BOOK X,"In misery hast thou left me, and I look"
8008,BOOK X,To see calamities more deadly yet.
8009,BOOK X,Oh that the Spirits of the Storm had snatched
8010,BOOK X,Me from the earth when first I fared with thee
8011,BOOK X,Drawn by a baleful Fate!  It might not be;
8012,BOOK X,The Gods have meted ruin to thee and me.
8013,BOOK X,"With shuddering horror all men look on me,"
8014,BOOK X,All hate me!  Place of refuge is there none
8015,BOOK X,"For me; for if to the Danaan host I fly,"
8016,BOOK X,"With torments will they greet me.  If I stay,"
8017,BOOK X,Troy's sons and daughters here will compass me
8018,BOOK X,"And rend me.  Earth shall cover not my corpse,"
8019,BOOK X,But dogs and fowl of ravin shall devour.
8020,BOOK X,"Oh had Fate slain me ere I saw these woes!"""
8021,BOOK X,
8022,BOOK X,So cried she: but for him far less she mourned
8023,BOOK X,"Than for herself, remembering her own sin."
8024,BOOK X,"Yea, and Troy's daughters but in semblance wailed"
8025,BOOK X,For him: of other woes their hearts were full.
8026,BOOK X,"Some thought on parents, some on husbands slain,"
8027,BOOK X,"These on their sons, on honoured kinsmen those."
8028,BOOK X,
8029,BOOK X,"One only heart was pierced with grief unfeigned,"
8030,BOOK X,"Oenone.  Not with them of Troy she wailed,"
8031,BOOK X,But far away within that desolate home
8032,BOOK X,Moaning she lay on her lost husband's bed.
8033,BOOK X,As when the copses on high mountains stand
8034,BOOK X,"White-veiled with frozen snow, which o'er the glens"
8035,BOOK X,"The west-wind blasts have strown, but now the sun"
8036,BOOK X,"And east-wind melt it fast, and the long heights"
8037,BOOK X,"With water-courses stream, and down the glades"
8038,BOOK X,"Slide, as they thaw, the heavy sheets, to swell"
8039,BOOK X,"The rushing waters of an ice-cold spring,"
8040,BOOK X,"So melted she in tears of anguished pain,"
8041,BOOK X,"And for her own, her husband, agonised,"
8042,BOOK X,And cried to her heart with miserable moans:
8043,BOOK X,"""Woe for my wickedness!  O hateful life!"
8044,BOOK X,I loved mine hapless husband--dreamed with him
8045,BOOK X,"To pace to eld's bright threshold hand in hand,"
8046,BOOK X,And heart in heart!  The gods ordained not so.
8047,BOOK X,Oh had the black Fates snatched me from the earth
8048,BOOK X,Ere I from Paris turned away in hate!
8049,BOOK X,My living love hath left me!--yet will I
8050,BOOK X,"Dare to die with him, for I loathe the light."""
8051,BOOK X,
8052,BOOK X,"So cried she, weeping, weeping piteously,"
8053,BOOK X,"Remembering him whom death had swallowed up,"
8054,BOOK X,"Wasting, as melteth wax before the flame"
8055,BOOK X,"Yet secretly, being fearful lest her sire"
8056,BOOK X,"Should mark it, or her handmaids till the night"
8057,BOOK X,"Rose from broad Ocean, flooding all the earth"
8058,BOOK X,With darkness bringing men release from toil.
8059,BOOK X,"Then, while her father and her maidens slept,"
8060,BOOK X,"She slid the bolts back of the outer doors,"
8061,BOOK X,"And rushed forth like a storm-blast.  Fast she ran,"
8062,BOOK X,"As when a heifer 'mid the mountains speeds,"
8063,BOOK X,"Her heart with passion stung, to meet her mate,"
8064,BOOK X,"And madly races on with flying feet,"
8065,BOOK X,"And fears not, in her frenzy of desire,"
8066,BOOK X,"The herdman, as her wild rush bears her on,"
8067,BOOK X,So she but find her mate amid the woods;
8068,BOOK X,So down the long tracks flew Oenone's feet;
8069,BOOK X,"Seeking the awful pyre, to leap thereon."
8070,BOOK X,No weariness she knew: as upon wings
8071,BOOK X,"Her feet flew faster ever, onward spurred"
8072,BOOK X,"By fell Fate, and the Cyprian Queen.  She feared"
8073,BOOK X,No shaggy beast that met her in the dark
8074,BOOK X,Who erst had feared them sorely--rugged rock
8075,BOOK X,"And precipice of tangled mountain-slope,"
8076,BOOK X,She trod them all unstumbling; torrent-beds
8077,BOOK X,She leapt.  The white Moon-goddess from on high
8078,BOOK X,"Looked on her, and remembered her own love,"
8079,BOOK X,"Princely Endymion, and she pitied her"
8080,BOOK X,"In that wild race, and, shining overhead"
8081,BOOK X,"In her full brightness, made the long tracks plain."
8082,BOOK X,
8083,BOOK X,Through mountain-gorges so she won to where
8084,BOOK X,Wailed other Nymphs round Alexander's corpse.
8085,BOOK X,Roared up about him a great wall of fire;
8086,BOOK X,For from the mountains far and near had come
8087,BOOK X,"Shepherds, and heaped the death-bale broad and high"
8088,BOOK X,For love's and sorrow's latest service done
8089,BOOK X,To one of old their comrade and their king.
8090,BOOK X,"Sore weeping stood they round.  She raised no wail,"
8091,BOOK X,"The broken-hearted, when she saw him there,"
8092,BOOK X,"But, in her mantle muffling up her face,"
8093,BOOK X,Leapt on the pyre: loud wailed that multitude.
8094,BOOK X,"There burned she, clasping Paris.  All the Nymphs"
8095,BOOK X,"Marvelled, beholding her beside her lord"
8096,BOOK X,"Flung down, and heart to heart spake whispering:"
8097,BOOK X,"""Verily evil-hearted Paris was,"
8098,BOOK X,"Who left a leal true wife, and took for bride"
8099,BOOK X,"A wanton, to himself and Troy a curse."
8100,BOOK X,"Ah fool, who recked not of the broken heart"
8101,BOOK X,"Of a most virtuous wife, who more than life"
8102,BOOK X,"Loved him who turned from her and loved her not!"""
8103,BOOK X,
8104,BOOK X,So in their hearts the Nymphs spake: but they twain
8105,BOOK X,"Burned on the pyre, never to hail again"
8106,BOOK X,"The dayspring.  Wondering herdmen stood around,"
8107,BOOK X,As once the thronging Argives marvelling saw
8108,BOOK X,Evadne clasping mid the fire her lord
8109,BOOK X,"Capaneus, slain by Zeus' dread thunderbolt."
8110,BOOK X,But when the blast of the devouring fire
8111,BOOK X,"Had made twain one, Oenone and Paris, now"
8112,BOOK X,"One little heap of ashes, then with wine"
8113,BOOK X,"Quenched they the embers, and they laid their bones"
8114,BOOK X,"In a wide golden vase, and round them piled"
8115,BOOK X,The earth-mound; and they set two pillars there
8116,BOOK X,That each from other ever turn away;
8117,BOOK X,For the old jealousy in the marble lives.
8118,BOOK X,
8119,BOOK X,
8120,BOOK X,
8121,BOOK XI,BOOK XI
8122,BOOK XI,
8123,BOOK XI,How the sons of Troy for the last time fought from her walls and
8124,BOOK XI,her towers.
8125,BOOK XI,
8126,BOOK XI,
8127,BOOK XI,Troy's daughters mourned within her walls; might none
8128,BOOK XI,"Go forth to Paris' tomb, for far away"
8129,BOOK XI,From high-built Troy it lay.  But the young men
8130,BOOK XI,Without the city toiled unceasingly
8131,BOOK XI,"In fight wherein from slaughter rest was none,"
8132,BOOK XI,Though dead was Paris; for the Achaeans pressed
8133,BOOK XI,Hard on the Trojans even unto Troy.
8134,BOOK XI,"Yet these charged forth--they could not choose but so,"
8135,BOOK XI,For Strife and deadly Enyo in their midst
8136,BOOK XI,"Stalked, like the fell Erinyes to behold,"
8137,BOOK XI,Breathing destruction from their lips like flame.
8138,BOOK XI,Beside them raged the ruthless-hearted Fates
8139,BOOK XI,Fiercely: here Panic-fear and Ares there
8140,BOOK XI,Stirred up the hosts: hard after followed
8141,BOOK XI,"Dread With slaughter's gore besprent, that in one host"
8142,BOOK XI,"Might men see, and be strong, in the other fear;"
8143,BOOK XI,"And all around were javelins, spears, and darts"
8144,BOOK XI,"Murder-athirst from this side, that side, showered."
8145,BOOK XI,"Aye, as they hurled together, armour clashed,"
8146,BOOK XI,As foe with foe grappled in murderous fight.
8147,BOOK XI,
8148,BOOK XI,"There Neoptolemus slew Laodamas,"
8149,BOOK XI,"Whom Lycia nurtured by fair Xanthus' stream,"
8150,BOOK XI,"The stream revealed to men by Leto, bride"
8151,BOOK XI,"Of Thunderer Zeus, when Lycia's stony plain"
8152,BOOK XI,Was by her hands uptorn mid agonies
8153,BOOK XI,Of travail-throes wherein she brought to light
8154,BOOK XI,Mid bitter pangs those babes of birth divine.
8155,BOOK XI,Nirus upon him laid he dead; the spear
8156,BOOK XI,"Crashed through his jaw, and clear through mouth and tongue"
8157,BOOK XI,Passed: on the lance's irresistible point
8158,BOOK XI,Shrieking was he impaled: flooded with gore
8159,BOOK XI,"His mouth was as he cried.  The cruel shaft,"
8160,BOOK XI,"Sped on by that strong hand, dashed him to earth"
8161,BOOK XI,In throes of death.  Evenor next he smote
8162,BOOK XI,"Above the flank, and onward drave the spear"
8163,BOOK XI,Into his liver: swiftly anguished death
8164,BOOK XI,Came upon him.  Iphition next he slew:
8165,BOOK XI,"He quelled Hippomedon, Hippasus' bold son,"
8166,BOOK XI,Whom Ocyone the Nymph had borne beside
8167,BOOK XI,Sangarius' river-flow.  Ne'er welcomed she
8168,BOOK XI,"Her son's returning face, but ruthless Fate"
8169,BOOK XI,With anguish thrilled her of her child bereaved.
8170,BOOK XI,
8171,BOOK XI,"Bremon Aeneas slew, and Andromachus,"
8172,BOOK XI,"Of Cnossus this, of hallowed Lyctus that:"
8173,BOOK XI,On one spot both from their swift chariots fell;
8174,BOOK XI,"This gasped for breath, his throat by the long spear"
8175,BOOK XI,"Transfixed; that other, by a massy stone,"
8176,BOOK XI,"Sped from a strong hand, on the temple struck,"
8177,BOOK XI,"Breathed out his life, and black doom shrouded him."
8178,BOOK XI,"The startled steeds, bereft of charioteers,"
8179,BOOK XI,"Fleeing, mid all those corpses were confused,"
8180,BOOK XI,And princely Aeneas' henchmen seized on them
8181,BOOK XI,With hearts exulting in the goodly spoil.
8182,BOOK XI,
8183,BOOK XI,There Philoctetes with his deadly shaft
8184,BOOK XI,Smote Peirasus in act to flee the war:
8185,BOOK XI,"The tendons twain behind the knee it snapped,"
8186,BOOK XI,"And palsied all his speed.  A Danaan marked,"
8187,BOOK XI,And leapt on that maimed man with sweep of sword
8188,BOOK XI,Shearing his neck through.  On the breast of earth
8189,BOOK XI,The headless body fell: the head far flung
8190,BOOK XI,Went rolling with lips parted as to shriek;
8191,BOOK XI,And swiftly fleeted thence the homeless soul.
8192,BOOK XI,
8193,BOOK XI,Polydamas struck down Eurymachus
8194,BOOK XI,And Cleon with his spear.  From Syme came
8195,BOOK XI,With Nireus' following these: cunning were both
8196,BOOK XI,In craft of fisher-folk to east the hook
8197,BOOK XI,"Baited with guile, to drop into the sea"
8198,BOOK XI,"The net, from the boat's prow with deftest hands"
8199,BOOK XI,Swiftly and straight to plunge the three-forked spear.
8200,BOOK XI,But not from bane their sea-craft saved them now.
8201,BOOK XI,
8202,BOOK XI,"Eurypylus battle-staunch laid Hellus low,"
8203,BOOK XI,"Whom Cleito bare beside Gygaea's mere,"
8204,BOOK XI,Cleito the fair-cheeked.  Face-down in the dust
8205,BOOK XI,Outstretched he lay: shorn by the cruel sword
8206,BOOK XI,From his strong shoulder fell the arm that held
8207,BOOK XI,"His long spear.  Still its muscles twitched, as though"
8208,BOOK XI,Fain to uplift the lance for fight in vain;
8209,BOOK XI,"For the man's will no longer stirred therein,"
8210,BOOK XI,"But aimlessly it quivered, even as leaps"
8211,BOOK XI,"The severed tail of a snake malignant-eyed,"
8212,BOOK XI,Which cannot chase the man who dealt the wound;
8213,BOOK XI,So the right hand of that strong-hearted man
8214,BOOK XI,With impotent grip still clutched the spear for fight.
8215,BOOK XI,
8216,BOOK XI,"Aenus and Polydorus Odysseus slew,"
8217,BOOK XI,"Ceteians both; this perished by his spear,"
8218,BOOK XI,That by his sword death-dealing.  Sthenelus
8219,BOOK XI,Smote godlike Abas with a javelin-cast:
8220,BOOK XI,On through his throat and shuddering nape it rushed:
8221,BOOK XI,"Stopped were his heart-beats, all his limbs collapsed."
8222,BOOK XI,
8223,BOOK XI,Tydeides slew Laodocus; Melius fell
8224,BOOK XI,By Agamemnon's hand; Deiphobus
8225,BOOK XI,"Smote Alcimus and Dryas: Hippasus,"
8226,BOOK XI,"How war-renowned soe'er, Agenor slew"
8227,BOOK XI,"Far from Peneius' river.  Crushed by fate,"
8228,BOOK XI,Love's nursing-debt to parents ne'er he paid.
8229,BOOK XI,
8230,BOOK XI,"Lamus and stalwart Lyncus Thoas smote,"
8231,BOOK XI,And Meriones slew Lycon; Menelaus
8232,BOOK XI,Laid low Archelochus.  Upon his home
8233,BOOK XI,"Looked down Corycia's ridge, and that great rock"
8234,BOOK XI,"Of the wise Fire-god, marvellous in men's eyes;"
8235,BOOK XI,"For thereon, nightlong, daylong, unto him"
8236,BOOK XI,"Fire blazes, tireless and unquenchable."
8237,BOOK XI,"Laden with fruit around it palm-trees grow,"
8238,BOOK XI,While mid the stones fire plays about their roots.
8239,BOOK XI,"Gods' work is this, a wonder to all time."
8240,BOOK XI,
8241,BOOK XI,"By Teucer princely Hippomedon's son was slain,"
8242,BOOK XI,"Menoetes: as the archer drew on him,"
8243,BOOK XI,Rushed he to smite him; but already hand
8244,BOOK XI,"And eye, and bow-craft keen were aiming straight"
8245,BOOK XI,On the arching horn the shaft.  Swiftly released
8246,BOOK XI,"It leapt on the hapless man, while sang the string."
8247,BOOK XI,"Stricken full front he heaved one choking gasp,"
8248,BOOK XI,Because the fates on the arrow riding flew
8249,BOOK XI,"Right to his heart, the throne of thought and strength"
8250,BOOK XI,"For men, whence short the path is unto death."
8251,BOOK XI,
8252,BOOK XI,Far from his brawny hand Euryalus hurled
8253,BOOK XI,"A massy stone, and shook the ranks of Troy."
8254,BOOK XI,As when in anger against long-screaming cranes
8255,BOOK XI,"A watcher of the field leaps from the ground,"
8256,BOOK XI,"In swift hand whirling round his head the sling,"
8257,BOOK XI,"And speeds the stone against them, scattering"
8258,BOOK XI,Before its hum their ranks far down the wind
8259,BOOK XI,"Outspread, and they in huddled panic dart"
8260,BOOK XI,"With wild cries this way and that, who theretofore"
8261,BOOK XI,Swept on in ordered lines; so shrank the foe
8262,BOOK XI,To right and left from that dread bolt of doom
8263,BOOK XI,Hurled of Euryalus.  Not in vain it flew
8264,BOOK XI,Fate-winged; it shattered Meles' helm and head
8265,BOOK XI,Down to the eyes: so met him ghastly death.
8266,BOOK XI,
8267,BOOK XI,"Still man slew man, while earth groaned all around,"
8268,BOOK XI,"As when a mighty wind scourges the land,"
8269,BOOK XI,"And this way, that way, under its shrieking blasts"
8270,BOOK XI,Through the wide woodland bow from the roots and fall
8271,BOOK XI,"Great trees, while all the earth is thundering round;"
8272,BOOK XI,"So fell they in the dust, so clanged their arms,"
8273,BOOK XI,So crashed the earth around.  Still hot were they
8274,BOOK XI,"For fell fight, still dealt bane unto their foes."
8275,BOOK XI,
8276,BOOK XI,"Nigh to Aeneas then Apollo came,"
8277,BOOK XI,"And to Eurymachus, brave Antenor's son;"
8278,BOOK XI,For these against the mighty Achaeans fought
8279,BOOK XI,"Shoulder to shoulder, as two strong oxen, matched"
8280,BOOK XI,"In age, yoked to a wain; nor ever ceased"
8281,BOOK XI,From battling.  Suddenly spake the God to these
8282,BOOK XI,"In Polymestor's shape, the seer his mother"
8283,BOOK XI,By Xanthus bare to the Far-darter's priest:
8284,BOOK XI,"""Eurymachus, Aeneas, seed of Gods,"
8285,BOOK XI,"'Twere shame if ye should flinch from Argives!  Nay,"
8286,BOOK XI,"Not Ares' self should joy to encounter you,"
8287,BOOK XI,An ye would face him in the fray; for Fate
8288,BOOK XI,"Hath spun long destiny-threads for thee and thee."""
8289,BOOK XI,
8290,BOOK XI,"He spake, and vanished, mingling with the winds."
8291,BOOK XI,But their hearts felt the God's power: suddenly
8292,BOOK XI,"Flooded with boundless courage were their frames,"
8293,BOOK XI,Maddened their spirits: on the foe they leapt
8294,BOOK XI,Like furious wasps that in a storm of rage
8295,BOOK XI,"Swoop upon bees, beholding them draw nigh"
8296,BOOK XI,"In latter-summer to the mellowing grapes,"
8297,BOOK XI,Or from their hives forth-streaming thitherward;
8298,BOOK XI,So fiercely leapt these sons of Troy to meet
8299,BOOK XI,War-hardened Greeks.  The black Fates joyed to see
8300,BOOK XI,"Their conflict, Ares laughed, Enyo yelled"
8301,BOOK XI,Horribly.  Loud their glancing armour clanged:
8302,BOOK XI,"They stabbed, they hewed down hosts of foes untold"
8303,BOOK XI,With irresistible hands.  The reeling ranks
8304,BOOK XI,"Fell, as the swath falls in the harvest heat,"
8305,BOOK XI,"When the swift-handed reapers, ranged adown"
8306,BOOK XI,"The field's long furrows, ply the sickle fast;"
8307,BOOK XI,So fell before their hands ranks numberless:
8308,BOOK XI,"With corpses earth was heaped, with torrent blood"
8309,BOOK XI,Was streaming: Strife incarnate o'er the slain
8310,BOOK XI,"Gloated.  They paused not from the awful toil,"
8311,BOOK XI,"But aye pressed on, like lions chasing sheep."
8312,BOOK XI,Then turned the Greeks to craven flight; all feet
8313,BOOK XI,Unmaimed as yet fled from the murderous war.
8314,BOOK XI,"Aye followed on Anchises' warrior son,"
8315,BOOK XI,Smiting foes' backs with his avenging spear:
8316,BOOK XI,"On pressed Eurymachus, while glowed the heart"
8317,BOOK XI,Of Healer Apollo watching from on high.
8318,BOOK XI,
8319,BOOK XI,As when a man descries a herd of swine
8320,BOOK XI,"Draw nigh his ripening corn, before the sheaves"
8321,BOOK XI,"Fall neath the reapers' hands, and harketh on"
8322,BOOK XI,"Against them his strong dogs; as down they rush,"
8323,BOOK XI,The spoilers see and quake; no more think they
8324,BOOK XI,"Of feasting, but they turn in panic flight"
8325,BOOK XI,Huddling: fast follow at their heels the hounds
8326,BOOK XI,"Biting remorselessly, while long and loud"
8327,BOOK XI,"Squealing they flee, and joys the harvest's lord;"
8328,BOOK XI,"So rejoiced Phoebus, seeing from the war"
8329,BOOK XI,Fleeing the mighty Argive host.  No more
8330,BOOK XI,"Cared they for deeds of men, but cried to the Gods"
8331,BOOK XI,"For swift feet, in whose feet alone was hope"
8332,BOOK XI,To escape Eurymachus' and Aeneas' spears
8333,BOOK XI,Which lightened ever all along their rear.
8334,BOOK XI,
8335,BOOK XI,"But one Greek, over-trusting in his strength,"
8336,BOOK XI,"Or by Fate's malice to destruction drawn,"
8337,BOOK XI,"Curbed in mid flight from war's turmoil his steed,"
8338,BOOK XI,And strove to wheel him round into the fight
8339,BOOK XI,To face the foe.  But fierce Agenor thrust
8340,BOOK XI,Ere he was ware; his two-edged partizan
8341,BOOK XI,"Shore though his shoulder; yea, the very bone"
8342,BOOK XI,Of that gashed arm was cloven by the steel;
8343,BOOK XI,"The tendons parted, the veins spirted blood:"
8344,BOOK XI,"Down by his horse's neck he slid, and straight"
8345,BOOK XI,Fell mid the dead.  But still the strong arm hung
8346,BOOK XI,With rigid fingers locked about the reins
8347,BOOK XI,"Like a live man's.  Weird marvel was that sight,"
8348,BOOK XI,"The bloody hand down hanging from the rein,"
8349,BOOK XI,"Scaring the foes yet more, by Ares' will."
8350,BOOK XI,"Thou hadst said, ""It craveth still for horsemanship!"""
8351,BOOK XI,So bare the steed that sign of his slain lord.
8352,BOOK XI,
8353,BOOK XI,Aeneas hurled his spear; it found the waist
8354,BOOK XI,"Of Anthalus' son, it pierced the navel through,"
8355,BOOK XI,"Dragging the inwards with it.  Stretched in dust,"
8356,BOOK XI,"Clutching with agonized hands at steel and bowels,"
8357,BOOK XI,"Horribly shrieked he, tore with his teeth the earth"
8358,BOOK XI,"Groaning, till life and pain forsook the man."
8359,BOOK XI,"Scared were the Argives, like a startled team"
8360,BOOK XI,"Of oxen 'neath the yoke-band straining hard,"
8361,BOOK XI,What time the sharp-fanged gadfly stings their flanks
8362,BOOK XI,"Athirst for blood, and they in frenzy of pain"
8363,BOOK XI,"Start from the furrow, and sore disquieted"
8364,BOOK XI,"The hind is for marred work, and for their sake,"
8365,BOOK XI,Lest haply the recoiling ploughshare light
8366,BOOK XI,"On their leg-sinews, and hamstring his team;"
8367,BOOK XI,"So were the Danaans scared, so feared for them"
8368,BOOK XI,"Achilles' son, and shouted thunder-voiced:"
8369,BOOK XI,"""Cravens, why flee, like starlings nothing-worth"
8370,BOOK XI,Scared by a hawk that swoopeth down on them?
8371,BOOK XI,"Come, play the men!  Better it is by far"
8372,BOOK XI,"To die in war than choose unmanly flight!"""
8373,BOOK XI,
8374,BOOK XI,"Then to his cry they hearkened, and straightway"
8375,BOOK XI,Were of good heart.  Mighty of mood he leapt
8376,BOOK XI,"Upon the Trojans, swinging in his hand"
8377,BOOK XI,The lightening spear: swept after him his host
8378,BOOK XI,Of Myrmidons with hearts swelled with the strength
8379,BOOK XI,Resistless of a tempest; so the Greeks
8380,BOOK XI,Won breathing-space.  With fury like his sire's
8381,BOOK XI,One after other slew he of the foe.
8382,BOOK XI,"Recoiling back they fell, as waves on-rolled"
8383,BOOK XI,"By Boreas foaming from the deep to the strand,"
8384,BOOK XI,Are caught by another blast that whirlwind-like
8385,BOOK XI,"Leaps, in a short lull of the north-wind, forth,"
8386,BOOK XI,"Smites them full-face, and hurls them back from the shore;"
8387,BOOK XI,So them that erewhile on the Danaans pressed
8388,BOOK XI,Godlike Achilles' son now backward hurled
8389,BOOK XI,A short space only brave Aeneas' spirit
8390,BOOK XI,"Let him not flee, but made him bide the fight"
8391,BOOK XI,Fearlessly; and Enyo level held
8392,BOOK XI,The battle's scales.  Yet not against Aeneas
8393,BOOK XI,"Achilles' son upraised his father's spear,"
8394,BOOK XI,But elsewhither turned his fury: in reverence
8395,BOOK XI,"For Aphrodite, Thetis splendour-veiled"
8396,BOOK XI,Turned from that man her mighty son's son's rage
8397,BOOK XI,And giant strength on other hosts of foes.
8398,BOOK XI,"There slew he many a Trojan, while the ranks"
8399,BOOK XI,Of Greeks were ravaged by Aeneas' hand.
8400,BOOK XI,"Over the battle-slain the vultures joyed,"
8401,BOOK XI,Hungry to rend the hearts and flesh of men.
8402,BOOK XI,"But all the Nymphs were wailing, daughters born"
8403,BOOK XI,Of Xanthus and fair-flowing Simois.
8404,BOOK XI,
8405,BOOK XI,So toiled they in the fight: the wind's breath rolled
8406,BOOK XI,Huge dust-clouds up; the illimitable air
8407,BOOK XI,"Was one thick haze, as with a sudden mist:"
8408,BOOK XI,"Earth disappeared, faces were blotted out;"
8409,BOOK XI,"Yet still they fought on; each man, whomso he met,"
8410,BOOK XI,"Ruthlessly slew him, though his very friend"
8411,BOOK XI,It might be--in that turmoil none could tell
8412,BOOK XI,"Who met him, friend or foe: blind wilderment"
8413,BOOK XI,Enmeshed the hosts.  And now had all been blent
8414,BOOK XI,"Confusedly, had perished miserably,"
8415,BOOK XI,"All falling by their fellows' murderous swords,"
8416,BOOK XI,Had not Cronion from Olympus helped
8417,BOOK XI,"Their sore strait, and he swept aside the dust"
8418,BOOK XI,"Of conflict, and he calmed those deadly winds."
8419,BOOK XI,Yet still the hosts fought on; but lighter far
8420,BOOK XI,"Their battle-travail was, who now discerned"
8421,BOOK XI,"Whom in the fray to smite, and whom to spare."
8422,BOOK XI,"The Danaans now forced back the Trojan host,"
8423,BOOK XI,"The Trojans now the Danaan ranks, as swayed"
8424,BOOK XI,The dread fight to and fro.  From either side
8425,BOOK XI,Darts leapt and fell like snowflakes.  Far away
8426,BOOK XI,"Shepherds from Ida trembling watched the strife,"
8427,BOOK XI,And to the Heaven-abiders lifted hands
8428,BOOK XI,"Of supplication, praying that all their foes"
8429,BOOK XI,"Might perish, and that from the woeful war"
8430,BOOK XI,"Troy might win breathing-space, and see at last"
8431,BOOK XI,The day of freedom: the Gods hearkened not.
8432,BOOK XI,"Far other issues Fate devised, nor recked"
8433,BOOK XI,"Of Zeus the Almighty, nor of none beside"
8434,BOOK XI,Of the Immortals.  Her unpitying soul
8435,BOOK XI,Cares naught what doom she spinneth with her thread
8436,BOOK XI,"Inevitable, be it for men new-born"
8437,BOOK XI,Or cities: all things wax and wane through her.
8438,BOOK XI,So by her hest the battle-travail swelled
8439,BOOK XI,'Twixt Trojan chariot-lords and Greeks that closed
8440,BOOK XI,In grapple of fight--they dealt each other death
8441,BOOK XI,"Ruthlessly: no man quailed, but stout of heart"
8442,BOOK XI,Fought on; for courage thrusts men into war.
8443,BOOK XI,
8444,BOOK XI,"But now when many had perished in the dust,"
8445,BOOK XI,Then did the Argive might prevail at last
8446,BOOK XI,By stern decree of Pallas; for she came
8447,BOOK XI,"Into the heart of battle, hot to help"
8448,BOOK XI,The Greeks to lay waste Priam's glorious town.
8449,BOOK XI,"Then Aphrodite, who lamented sore"
8450,BOOK XI,"For Paris slain, snatched suddenly away"
8451,BOOK XI,"Renowned Aeneas from the deadly strife,"
8452,BOOK XI,And poured thick mist about him.  Fate forbade
8453,BOOK XI,That hero any longer to contend
8454,BOOK XI,With Argive foes without the high-built wall.
8455,BOOK XI,"Yea, and his mother sorely feared the wrath"
8456,BOOK XI,"Of Pallas passing-wise, whose heart was keen"
8457,BOOK XI,"To help the Danaans now--yea, feared lest she"
8458,BOOK XI,"Might slay him even beyond his doom, who spared"
8459,BOOK XI,"Not Ares' self, a mightier far than he."
8460,BOOK XI,
8461,BOOK XI,No more the Trojans now abode the edge
8462,BOOK XI,"Of fight, but all disheartened backward drew."
8463,BOOK XI,For like fierce ravening beasts the Argive men
8464,BOOK XI,"Leapt on them, mad with murderous rage of war."
8465,BOOK XI,"Choked with their slain the river-channels were,"
8466,BOOK XI,"Heaped was the field; in red dust thousands fell,"
8467,BOOK XI,Horses and men; and chariots overturned
8468,BOOK XI,Were strewn there: blood was streaming all around
8469,BOOK XI,"Like rain, for deadly Doom raged through the fray."
8470,BOOK XI,
8471,BOOK XI,"Men stabbed with swords, and men impaled on spears"
8472,BOOK XI,"Lay all confusedly, like scattered beams,"
8473,BOOK XI,When on the strand of the low-thundering sea
8474,BOOK XI,Men from great girders of a tall ship's hull
8475,BOOK XI,"Strike out the bolts and clamps, and scatter wide"
8476,BOOK XI,"Long planks and timbers, till the whole broad beach"
8477,BOOK XI,Is paved with beams o'erplashed by darkling surge;
8478,BOOK XI,"So lay in dust and blood those slaughtered men,"
8479,BOOK XI,Rapture and pain of fight forgotten now.
8480,BOOK XI,
8481,BOOK XI,A remnant from the pitiless strife escaped
8482,BOOK XI,"Entered their stronghold, scarce eluding doom."
8483,BOOK XI,Children and wives from their limbs blood-besprent
8484,BOOK XI,Received their arms bedabbled with foul gore;
8485,BOOK XI,And baths for all were heated.  Leeches ran
8486,BOOK XI,Through all the town in hot haste to the homes
8487,BOOK XI,Of wounded men to minister to their hurts.
8488,BOOK XI,Here wives and daughters moaned round men come back
8489,BOOK XI,"From war, there cried on many who came not"
8490,BOOK XI,"Here, men stung to the soul by bitter pangs"
8491,BOOK XI,"Groaned upon beds of pain; there, toil-spent men"
8492,BOOK XI,Turned them to supper.  Whinnied the swift steeds
8493,BOOK XI,And neighed o'er mangers heaped.  By tent and ship
8494,BOOK XI,Far off the Greeks did even as they of Troy.
8495,BOOK XI,
8496,BOOK XI,When o'er the streams of Ocean Dawn drove up
8497,BOOK XI,"Her splendour-flashing steeds, and earth's tribes waked,"
8498,BOOK XI,Then the strong Argives' battle-eager sons
8499,BOOK XI,"Marched against Priam's city lofty-towered,"
8500,BOOK XI,Save some that mid the tents by wounded men
8501,BOOK XI,"Tarried, lest haply raiders on the ships"
8502,BOOK XI,"Might fall, to help the Trojans, while these fought"
8503,BOOK XI,"The foe from towers, while rose the flame of war."
8504,BOOK XI,
8505,BOOK XI,Before the Scaean gate fought Capaneus' son
8506,BOOK XI,And godlike Diomedes.  High above
8507,BOOK XI,Deiphobus battle-staunch and strong Polites
8508,BOOK XI,"With many comrades, stoutly held them back"
8509,BOOK XI,With arrows and huge stones.  Clanged evermore
8510,BOOK XI,The smitten helms and shields that fenced strong men
8511,BOOK XI,"From bitter doom and unrelenting fate,"
8512,BOOK XI,
8513,BOOK XI,Before the Gate Idaean Achilles' son
8514,BOOK XI,Set in array the fight: around him toiled
8515,BOOK XI,His host of battle-cunning Myrmidons.
8516,BOOK XI,"Helenus and Agenor gallant-souled,"
8517,BOOK XI,"Down-hailing darts, against them held the wall,"
8518,BOOK XI,Aye cheering on their men.  No spurring these
8519,BOOK XI,Needed to fight hard for their country's walls.
8520,BOOK XI,
8521,BOOK XI,Odysseus and Eurypylus made assault
8522,BOOK XI,Unresting on the gates that fated the plain
8523,BOOK XI,And looked to the swift ships.  From wall and tower
8524,BOOK XI,With huge stones brave Aeneas made defence.
8525,BOOK XI,
8526,BOOK XI,In battle-stress by Simons Teucer toiled.
8527,BOOK XI,Each endured hardness at his several post.
8528,BOOK XI,
8529,BOOK XI,"Then round war-wise Odysseus men renowned,"
8530,BOOK XI,"By that great captain's battle cunning ruled,"
8531,BOOK XI,"Locked shields together, raised them o'er their heads"
8532,BOOK XI,"Ranged side by side, that many were made one."
8533,BOOK XI,"Thou hadst said it was a great hall's solid roof,"
8534,BOOK XI,Which no tempestuous wind-blast misty wet
8535,BOOK XI,"Can pierce, nor rain from heaven in torrents poured."
8536,BOOK XI,So fenced about with shields firm stood the ranks
8537,BOOK XI,"Of Argives, one in heart for fight, and one"
8538,BOOK XI,In that array close-welded.  From above
8539,BOOK XI,The Trojans hailed great stones; as from a rock
8540,BOOK XI,Rolled these to earth.  Full many a spear and dart
8541,BOOK XI,And galling javelin in the pierced shields stood;
8542,BOOK XI,Some in the earth stood; many glanced away
8543,BOOK XI,With bent points falling baffled from the shields
8544,BOOK XI,Battered on all sides.  But that clangorous din
8545,BOOK XI,None feared; none flinched; as pattering drops of rain
8546,BOOK XI,They heard it.  Up to the rampart's foot they marched:
8547,BOOK XI,None hung back; shoulder to shoulder on they came
8548,BOOK XI,Like a long lurid cloud that o'er the sky
8549,BOOK XI,Cronion trails in wild midwinter-tide.
8550,BOOK XI,"On that battalion moved, with thunderous tread"
8551,BOOK XI,Of tramping feet: a little above the earth
8552,BOOK XI,Rose up the dust; the breeze swept it aside
8553,BOOK XI,Drifting away behind the men.  There went
8554,BOOK XI,"A sound confused of voices with them, like"
8555,BOOK XI,"The hum of bees that murmur round the hives,"
8556,BOOK XI,"And multitudinous panting, and the gasp"
8557,BOOK XI,Of men hard-breathing.  Exceeding glad the sons
8558,BOOK XI,"Of Atreus, glorying in them, saw that wall"
8559,BOOK XI,Unwavering of doom-denouncing war.
8560,BOOK XI,In one dense mass against the city-gate
8561,BOOK XI,"They hurled themselves, with twibills strove to breach"
8562,BOOK XI,"The long walls, from their hinges to upheave"
8563,BOOK XI,"The gates, and dash to earth.  The pulse of hope"
8564,BOOK XI,Beat strong in those proud hearts.  But naught availed
8565,BOOK XI,"Targes nor levers, when Aeneas' might"
8566,BOOK XI,"Swung in his hands a stone like a thunderbolt,"
8567,BOOK XI,"Hurled it with uttermost strength, and dashed to death"
8568,BOOK XI,"All whom it caught beneath the shields, as when"
8569,BOOK XI,A mountain's precipice-edge breaks off and falls
8570,BOOK XI,"On pasturing goats, and all that graze thereby"
8571,BOOK XI,Tremble; so were those Danaans dazed with dread.
8572,BOOK XI,"Stone after stone he hurled on the reeling ranks,"
8573,BOOK XI,As when amid the hills Olympian Zeus
8574,BOOK XI,With thunderbolts and blazing lightnings rends
8575,BOOK XI,"From their foundations crags that rim a peak,"
8576,BOOK XI,"And this way, that way, sends them hurtling down;"
8577,BOOK XI,"Then the flocks tremble, scattering in wild flight;"
8578,BOOK XI,"So quailed the Achaeans, when Aeneas dashed"
8579,BOOK XI,To sudden fragments all that battle-wall
8580,BOOK XI,"Moulded of adamant shields, because a God"
8581,BOOK XI,Gave more than human strength.  No man of them
8582,BOOK XI,"Could lift his eyes unto him in that fight,"
8583,BOOK XI,Because the arms that lapped his sinewy limbs
8584,BOOK XI,Flashed like the heaven-born lightnings.  At his side
8585,BOOK XI,"Stood, all his form divine in darkness cloaked,"
8586,BOOK XI,"Ares the terrible, and winged the flight"
8587,BOOK XI,Of what bare down to the Argives doom or dread.
8588,BOOK XI,He fought as when Olympian Zeus himself
8589,BOOK XI,From heaven in wrath smote down the insolent bands
8590,BOOK XI,"Of giants grim, and shook the boundless earth,"
8591,BOOK XI,"And sea, and ocean, and the heavens, when reeled"
8592,BOOK XI,The knees of Atlas neath the rush of Zeus.
8593,BOOK XI,So crumbled down beneath Aeneas' bolts
8594,BOOK XI,The Argive squadrons.  All along the wall
8595,BOOK XI,Wroth with the foeman rushed he: from his hands
8596,BOOK XI,Whatso he lighted on in onslaught-haste
8597,BOOK XI,Hurled he; for many a battle-staying bolt
8598,BOOK XI,Lay on the walls of those staunch Dardan men.
8599,BOOK XI,"With such Aeneas stormed in giant might,"
8600,BOOK XI,With such drave back the thronging foes.  All round
8601,BOOK XI,The Trojans played the men.  Sore travail and pain
8602,BOOK XI,"Had all folk round the city: many fell,"
8603,BOOK XI,Argives and Trojans.  Rang the battle-cries:
8604,BOOK XI,Aeneas cheered the war-fain Trojans on
8605,BOOK XI,"To fight for home, for wives, and their own souls"
8606,BOOK XI,With a good heart: war-staunch Achilles' son
8607,BOOK XI,"Shouted: ""Flinch not, ye Argives, from the walls,"
8608,BOOK XI,"Till Troy be taken, and sink down in flames!"""
8609,BOOK XI,And round these twain an awful measureless roar
8610,BOOK XI,"Rang, daylong as they fought: no breathing-space"
8611,BOOK XI,"Came from the war to them whose spirits burned,"
8612,BOOK XI,"These, to smite Ilium, those, to guard her safe."
8613,BOOK XI,
8614,BOOK XI,But from Aeneas valiant-souled afar
8615,BOOK XI,"Fought Aias, speeding midst the men of Troy"
8616,BOOK XI,Winged death; for now his arrow straight through air
8617,BOOK XI,"Flew, now his deadly dart, and smote them down"
8618,BOOK XI,One after one: yet others cowered away
8619,BOOK XI,"Before his peerless prowess, and abode"
8620,BOOK XI,"The fight no more, but fenceless left the wall"
8621,BOOK XI,
8622,BOOK XI,"Then one, of all the Locrians mightiest,"
8623,BOOK XI,"Fierce-souled Alcimedon, trusting in his prince"
8624,BOOK XI,"And his own might and valour of his youth,"
8625,BOOK XI,All battle-eager on a ladder set
8626,BOOK XI,"Swift feet, to pave for friends a death-strewn path"
8627,BOOK XI,Into the town.  Above his head he raised
8628,BOOK XI,
8629,BOOK XI,The screening shield; up that dread path he went
8630,BOOK XI,"Hardening his heart from trembling, in his hand"
8631,BOOK XI,"Now shook the threatening spear, now upward climbed"
8632,BOOK XI,Fast high in air he trod the perilous way.
8633,BOOK XI,"Now on the Trojans had disaster come,"
8634,BOOK XI,"But, even as above the parapet"
8635,BOOK XI,"His head rose, and for the first time and the last"
8636,BOOK XI,"From her high rampart he looked down on Troy,"
8637,BOOK XI,"Aeneas, who had marked, albeit afar,"
8638,BOOK XI,"That bold assault, rushed on him, dashed on his head"
8639,BOOK XI,So huge a stone that the hero's mighty strength
8640,BOOK XI,Shattered the ladder.  Down from on high he rushed
8641,BOOK XI,As arrow from the string: death followed him
8642,BOOK XI,As whirling round he fell; with air was blent
8643,BOOK XI,"His lost life, ere he crashed to the stony ground."
8644,BOOK XI,"Strong spear, broad shield, in mid fall flew from his hands,"
8645,BOOK XI,And from his head the helm: his corslet came
8646,BOOK XI,Alone with him to earth.  The Locrian men
8647,BOOK XI,"Groaned, seeing their champion quelled by evil doom;"
8648,BOOK XI,For all his hair and all the stones around
8649,BOOK XI,"Were brain-bespattered: all his bones were crushed,"
8650,BOOK XI,And his once active limbs besprent with gore.
8651,BOOK XI,
8652,BOOK XI,Then godlike Poeas' war-triumphant son
8653,BOOK XI,Marked where Aeneas stormed along the wall
8654,BOOK XI,"In lion-like strength, and straightway shot a shaft"
8655,BOOK XI,"Aimed at that glorious hero, neither missed"
8656,BOOK XI,The man: yet not through his unyielding targe
8657,BOOK XI,"To the fair flesh it won, being turned aside"
8658,BOOK XI,"By Cytherea and the shield, but grazed"
8659,BOOK XI,The buckler lightly: yet not all in vain
8660,BOOK XI,"Fell earthward, but between the targe and helm"
8661,BOOK XI,"Smote Medon: from the tower he fell, as falls"
8662,BOOK XI,"A wild goat from a crag, the hunter's shaft"
8663,BOOK XI,"Deep in its heart: so nerveless-flung he fell,"
8664,BOOK XI,And fled away from him the precious life.
8665,BOOK XI,"Wroth for his friend, a stone Aeneas hurled,"
8666,BOOK XI,"And Philoctetes' stalwart comrade slew,"
8667,BOOK XI,Toxaechmes; for he shattered his head and crushed
8668,BOOK XI,Helmet and skull-bones; and his noble heart
8669,BOOK XI,Was stilled.  Loud shouted princely Poeas' son:
8670,BOOK XI,"""Aeneas, thou, forsooth, dost deem thyself"
8671,BOOK XI,"A mighty champion, fighting from a tower"
8672,BOOK XI,Whence craven women war with foes!  Now if
8673,BOOK XI,"Thou be a man, come forth without the wall"
8674,BOOK XI,"In battle-harness, and so learn to know"
8675,BOOK XI,"In spear-craft and in bow-craft Poeas' son!"""
8676,BOOK XI,
8677,BOOK XI,"So cried he; but Anchises' valiant seed,"
8678,BOOK XI,"How fain soe'er, naught answered, for the stress"
8679,BOOK XI,Of desperate conflict round that wall and burg
8680,BOOK XI,Ceaselessly raging: pause from fight was none:
8681,BOOK XI,"Yea, for long time no respite had there been"
8682,BOOK XI,For the war-weary from that endless toil.
8683,BOOK XI,
8684,BOOK XI,
8685,BOOK XI,
8686,BOOK XII,BOOK XII
8687,BOOK XII,
8688,BOOK XII,"How the Wooden Horse was fashioned, and brought into Troy by her people."
8689,BOOK XII,
8690,BOOK XII,
8691,BOOK XII,When round the walls of Troy the Danaan host
8692,BOOK XII,"Had borne much travail, and yet the end was not,"
8693,BOOK XII,By Calchas then assembled were the chiefs;
8694,BOOK XII,For his heart was instructed by the hests
8695,BOOK XII,"Of Phoebus, by the flights of birds, the stars,"
8696,BOOK XII,And all the signs that speak to men the will
8697,BOOK XII,Of Heaven; so he to that assembly cried:
8698,BOOK XII,"""No longer toil in leaguer of yon walls;"
8699,BOOK XII,"Some other counsel let your hearts devise,"
8700,BOOK XII,Some stratagem to help the host and us.
8701,BOOK XII,For here but yesterday I saw a sign:
8702,BOOK XII,"A falcon chased a dove, and she, hard pressed,"
8703,BOOK XII,Entered a cleft of the rock; and chafing he
8704,BOOK XII,"Tarried long time hard by that rift, but she"
8705,BOOK XII,"Abode in covert.  Nursing still his wrath,"
8706,BOOK XII,"He hid him in a bush.  Forth darted she,"
8707,BOOK XII,"In folly deeming him afar: he swooped,"
8708,BOOK XII,And to the hapless dove dealt wretched death.
8709,BOOK XII,"Therefore by force essay we not to smite Troy,"
8710,BOOK XII,"but let cunning stratagem avail."""
8711,BOOK XII,
8712,BOOK XII,He spake; but no man's wit might find a way
8713,BOOK XII,"To escape their grievous travail, as they sought"
8714,BOOK XII,"To find a remedy, till Laertes' son"
8715,BOOK XII,"Discerned it of his wisdom, and he spake:"
8716,BOOK XII,"""Friend, in high honour held of the Heavenly Ones,"
8717,BOOK XII,If doomed it be indeed that Priam's burg
8718,BOOK XII,"By guile must fall before the war-worn Greeks,"
8719,BOOK XII,"A great Horse let us fashion, in the which"
8720,BOOK XII,Our mightiest shall take ambush.  Let the host
8721,BOOK XII,"Burn all their tents, and sail from hence away"
8722,BOOK XII,"To Tenedos; so the Trojans, from their towers"
8723,BOOK XII,"Gazing, shall stream forth fearless to the plain."
8724,BOOK XII,"Let some brave man, unknown of any in Troy,"
8725,BOOK XII,"With a stout heart abide without the Horse,"
8726,BOOK XII,"Crouching beneath its shadow, who shall say:"
8727,BOOK XII,"""`Achaea's lords of might, exceeding fain"
8728,BOOK XII,"Safe to win home, made this their offering"
8729,BOOK XII,"For safe return, an image to appease"
8730,BOOK XII,The wrath of Pallas for her image stolen
8731,BOOK XII,"From Troy.'  And to this story shall he stand,"
8732,BOOK XII,"How long soe'er they question him, until,"
8733,BOOK XII,"Though never so relentless, they believe,"
8734,BOOK XII,"And drag it, their own doom, within the town."
8735,BOOK XII,Then shall war's signal unto us be given--
8736,BOOK XII,"To them at sea, by sudden flash of torch,"
8737,BOOK XII,"To the ambush, by the cry, `Come forth the Horse!'"
8738,BOOK XII,"When unsuspecting sleep the sons of Troy."""
8739,BOOK XII,
8740,BOOK XII,"He spake, and all men praised him: most of all"
8741,BOOK XII,"Extolled him Calchas, that such marvellous guile"
8742,BOOK XII,"He put into the Achaeans' hearts, to be"
8743,BOOK XII,"For them assurance of triumph, but for Troy"
8744,BOOK XII,Ruin; and to those battle-lords he cried:
8745,BOOK XII,"""Let your hearts seek none other stratagem,"
8746,BOOK XII,Friends; to war-strong Odysseus' rede give ear.
8747,BOOK XII,His wise thought shall not miss accomplishment.
8748,BOOK XII,"Yea, our desire even now the Gods fulfil."
8749,BOOK XII,Hark!  for new tokens come from the Unseen!
8750,BOOK XII,"Lo, there on high crash through the firmament"
8751,BOOK XII,"Zeus' thunder and lightning!  See, where birds to right"
8752,BOOK XII,"Dart past, and scream with long-resounding cry!"
8753,BOOK XII,"Go to, no more in endless leaguer of Troy"
8754,BOOK XII,Linger we.  Hard necessity fills the foe
8755,BOOK XII,With desperate courage that makes cowards brave;
8756,BOOK XII,"For then are men most dangerous, when they stake"
8757,BOOK XII,"Their lives in utter recklessness of death,"
8758,BOOK XII,As battle now the aweless sons of Troy
8759,BOOK XII,"All round their burg, mad with the lust of fight."""
8760,BOOK XII,
8761,BOOK XII,But cried Achilles' battle-eager son:
8762,BOOK XII,"""Calchas, brave men meet face to face their foes!"
8763,BOOK XII,"Who skulk behind their walls, and fight from towers,"
8764,BOOK XII,"Are nidderings, hearts palsied with base fear."
8765,BOOK XII,Hence with all thought of wile and stratagem!
8766,BOOK XII,The great war-travail of the spear beseems
8767,BOOK XII,"True heroes.  Best in battle are the brave."""
8768,BOOK XII,
8769,BOOK XII,But answer made to him Laertes' seed:
8770,BOOK XII,"""Bold-hearted child of aweless Aeacus' son,"
8771,BOOK XII,"This as beseems a hero princely and brave,"
8772,BOOK XII,"Dauntlessly trusting in thy strength, thou say'st."
8773,BOOK XII,Yet thine invincible sire's unquailing might
8774,BOOK XII,"Availed not to smite Priam's wealthy burg,"
8775,BOOK XII,"Nor we, for all our travail.  Nay, with speed,"
8776,BOOK XII,"As counselleth Calchas, go we to the ships,"
8777,BOOK XII,"And fashion we the Horse by Epeius' hands,"
8778,BOOK XII,Who in the woodwright's craft is chiefest far
8779,BOOK XII,"Of Argives, for Athena taught his lore."""
8780,BOOK XII,
8781,BOOK XII,Then all their mightiest men gave ear to him
8782,BOOK XII,"Save twain, fierce-hearted Neoptolemus"
8783,BOOK XII,And Philoctetes mighty-souled; for these
8784,BOOK XII,"Still were insatiate for the bitter fray,"
8785,BOOK XII,Still longed for turmoil of the fight.  They bade
8786,BOOK XII,Their own folk bear against that giant wall
8787,BOOK XII,"What things soe'er for war's assaults avail,"
8788,BOOK XII,"In hope to lay that stately fortress low,"
8789,BOOK XII,Seeing Heaven's decrees had brought them both to war.
8790,BOOK XII,"Yea, they had haply accomplished all their will,"
8791,BOOK XII,But from the sky Zeus showed his wrath; he shook
8792,BOOK XII,"The earth beneath their feet, and all the air"
8793,BOOK XII,"Shuddered, as down before those heroes twain"
8794,BOOK XII,He hurled his thunderbolt: wide echoes crashed
8795,BOOK XII,Through all Dardania.  Unto fear straightway
8796,BOOK XII,"Turned were their bold hearts: they forgat their might,"
8797,BOOK XII,And Calchas' counsels grudgingly obeyed.
8798,BOOK XII,So with the Argives came they to the ships
8799,BOOK XII,In reverence for the seer who spake from Zeus
8800,BOOK XII,"Or Phoebus, and they obeyed him utterly."
8801,BOOK XII,
8802,BOOK XII,What time round splendour-kindled heavens the stars
8803,BOOK XII,"From east to west far-flashing wheel, and when"
8804,BOOK XII,"Man doth forget his toil, in that still hour"
8805,BOOK XII,"Athena left the high mansions of the Blest,"
8806,BOOK XII,"Clothed her in shape of a maiden tender-fleshed,"
8807,BOOK XII,And came to ships and host.  Over the head
8808,BOOK XII,"Of brave Epeius stood she in his dream,"
8809,BOOK XII,And bade him build a Horse of tree: herself
8810,BOOK XII,"Would labour in his labour, and herself"
8811,BOOK XII,"Stand by his side, to the work enkindling him."
8812,BOOK XII,"Hearing the Goddess' word, with a glad laugh"
8813,BOOK XII,Leapt he from careless sleep: right well he knew
8814,BOOK XII,The Immortal One celestial.  Now his heart
8815,BOOK XII,Could hold no thought beside; his mind was fixed
8816,BOOK XII,"Upon the wondrous work, and through his soul"
8817,BOOK XII,Marched marshalled each device of craftsmanship.
8818,BOOK XII,
8819,BOOK XII,"When rose the dawn, and thrust back kindly night"
8820,BOOK XII,"To Erebus, and through the firmament streamed"
8821,BOOK XII,"Glad glory, then Epeius told his dream"
8822,BOOK XII,To eager Argives--all he saw and heard;
8823,BOOK XII,And hearkening joyed they with exceeding joy.
8824,BOOK XII,Straightway to tall-tressed Ida's leafy glades
8825,BOOK XII,The sons of Atreus sent swift messengers.
8826,BOOK XII,"These laid the axe unto the forest-pines,"
8827,BOOK XII,And hewed the great trees: to their smiting rang
8828,BOOK XII,The echoing glens.  On those far-stretching hills
8829,BOOK XII,All bare of undergrowth the high peaks rose:
8830,BOOK XII,"Open their glades were, not, as in time past,"
8831,BOOK XII,Haunted of beasts: there dry the tree-trunks rose
8832,BOOK XII,Wooing the winds.  Even these the Achaeans hewed
8833,BOOK XII,"With axes, and in haste they bare them down"
8834,BOOK XII,From those shagged mountain heights to Hellespont's shores.
8835,BOOK XII,Strained with a strenuous spirit at the work
8836,BOOK XII,Young men and mules; and all the people toiled
8837,BOOK XII,Each at his task obeying Epeius's hest.
8838,BOOK XII,"For with the keen steel some were hewing beams,"
8839,BOOK XII,"Some measuring planks, and some with axes lopped"
8840,BOOK XII,Branches away from trunks as yet unsawn:
8841,BOOK XII,Each wrought his several work.  Epeius first
8842,BOOK XII,Fashioned the feet of that great Horse of Wood:
8843,BOOK XII,"The belly next he shaped, and over this"
8844,BOOK XII,"Moulded the back and the great loins behind,"
8845,BOOK XII,"The throat in front, and ridged the towering neck"
8846,BOOK XII,"With waving mane: the crested head he wrought,"
8847,BOOK XII,"The streaming tail, the ears, the lucent eyes--"
8848,BOOK XII,All that of lifelike horses have.  So grew
8849,BOOK XII,"Like a live thing that more than human work,"
8850,BOOK XII,For a God gave to a man that wondrous craft.
8851,BOOK XII,"And in three days, by Pallas's decree,"
8852,BOOK XII,Finished was all.  Rejoiced thereat the host
8853,BOOK XII,"Of Argos, marvelling how the wood expressed"
8854,BOOK XII,"Mettle, and speed of foot--yea, seemed to neigh."
8855,BOOK XII,Godlike Epeius then uplifted hands
8856,BOOK XII,"To Pallas, and for that huge Horse he prayed:"
8857,BOOK XII,"""Hear, great-souled Goddess: bless thine Horse and me!"""
8858,BOOK XII,"He spake: Athena rich in counsel heard,"
8859,BOOK XII,And made his work a marvel to all men
8860,BOOK XII,"Which saw, or heard its fame in days to be."
8861,BOOK XII,
8862,BOOK XII,But while the Danaans o'er Epeius' work
8863,BOOK XII,"Joyed, and their routed foes within the walls"
8864,BOOK XII,"Tarried, and shrank from death and pitiless doom,"
8865,BOOK XII,"Then, when imperious Zeus far from the Gods"
8866,BOOK XII,"Had gone to Ocean's streams and Tethys' caves,"
8867,BOOK XII,Strife rose between the Immortals: heart with heart
8868,BOOK XII,Was set at variance.  Riding on the blasts
8869,BOOK XII,"Of winds, from heaven to earth they swooped: the air"
8870,BOOK XII,Crashed round them.  Lighting down by Xanthus' stream
8871,BOOK XII,"Arrayed they stood against each other, these"
8872,BOOK XII,"For the Achaeans, for the Trojans those;"
8873,BOOK XII,And all their souls were thrilled with lust of war:
8874,BOOK XII,There gathered too the Lords of the wide Sea.
8875,BOOK XII,These in their wrath were eager to destroy
8876,BOOK XII,"The Horse of Guile and all the ships, and those"
8877,BOOK XII,Fair Ilium.  But all-contriving Fate
8878,BOOK XII,"Held them therefrom, and turned their hearts to strife"
8879,BOOK XII,Against each other.  Ares to the fray
8880,BOOK XII,"Rose first, and on Athena rushed.  Thereat"
8881,BOOK XII,Fell each on other: clashed around their limbs
8882,BOOK XII,The golden arms celestial as they charged.
8883,BOOK XII,"Round them the wide sea thundered, the dark earth"
8884,BOOK XII,Quaked 'neath immortal feet.  Rang from them all
8885,BOOK XII,Far-pealing battle-shouts; that awful cry
8886,BOOK XII,"Rolled up to the broad-arching heaven, and down"
8887,BOOK XII,Even to Hades' fathomless abyss:
8888,BOOK XII,Trembled the Titans there in depths of gloom.
8889,BOOK XII,"Ida's long ridges sighed, sobbed clamorous streams"
8890,BOOK XII,"Of ever-flowing rivers, groaned ravines"
8891,BOOK XII,"Far-furrowed, Argive ships, and Priam's towers."
8892,BOOK XII,"Yet men feared not, for naught they knew of all"
8893,BOOK XII,"That strife, by Heaven's decree.  Then her high peaks"
8894,BOOK XII,"The Gods' hands wrenched from Ida's crest, and hurled"
8895,BOOK XII,Against each other: but like crumbling sands
8896,BOOK XII,"Shivered they fell round those invincible limbs,"
8897,BOOK XII,"Shattered to small dust.  But the mind of Zeus,"
8898,BOOK XII,"At the utmost verge of earth, was ware of all:"
8899,BOOK XII,"Straight left he Ocean's stream, and to wide heaven"
8900,BOOK XII,"Ascended, charioted upon the winds,"
8901,BOOK XII,"The East, the North, the West-wind, and the South:"
8902,BOOK XII,For Iris rainbow-plumed led 'neath the yoke
8903,BOOK XII,"Of his eternal ear that stormy team,"
8904,BOOK XII,The ear which Time the immortal framed for him
8905,BOOK XII,Of adamant with never-wearying hands.
8906,BOOK XII,So came he to Olympus' giant ridge.
8907,BOOK XII,"His wrath shook all the firmament, as crashed"
8908,BOOK XII,"From east to west his thunders; lightnings gleamed,"
8909,BOOK XII,"As thick and fast his thunderbolts poured to earth,"
8910,BOOK XII,And flamed the limitless welkin.  Terror fell
8911,BOOK XII,Upon the hearts of those Immortals: quaked
8912,BOOK XII,"The limbs of all--ay, deathless though they were!"
8913,BOOK XII,"Then Themis, trembling for them, swift as thought"
8914,BOOK XII,"Leapt down through clouds, and came with speed to them--"
8915,BOOK XII,For in the strife she only had no part
8916,BOOK XII,"And stood between the fighters, and she cried:"
8917,BOOK XII,"""Forbear the conflict!  O, when Zeus is wroth,"
8918,BOOK XII,It ill beseems that everlasting Gods
8919,BOOK XII,"Should fight for men's sake, creatures of a day:"
8920,BOOK XII,Else shall ye be all suddenly destroyed;
8921,BOOK XII,"For Zeus will tear up all the hills, and hurl"
8922,BOOK XII,"Upon you: sons nor daughters will he spare,"
8923,BOOK XII,But bury 'neath one ruin of shattered earth
8924,BOOK XII,"All.  No escape shall ye find thence to light,"
8925,BOOK XII,"In horror of darkness prisoned evermore."""
8926,BOOK XII,
8927,BOOK XII,"Dreading Zeus' menace gave they heed to her,"
8928,BOOK XII,"From strife refrained, and cast away their wrath,"
8929,BOOK XII,And were made one in peace and amity.
8930,BOOK XII,"Some heavenward soared, some plunged into the sea,"
8931,BOOK XII,On earth stayed some.  Amid the Achaean host
8932,BOOK XII,Spake in his subtlety Laertes' son:
8933,BOOK XII,"""O valorous-hearted lords of the Argive host,"
8934,BOOK XII,"Now prove in time of need what men ye be,"
8935,BOOK XII,"How passing-strong, how flawless-brave!  The hour"
8936,BOOK XII,"Is this for desperate emprise: now, with hearts"
8937,BOOK XII,"Heroic, enter ye yon carven horse,"
8938,BOOK XII,So to attain the goal of this stern war.
8939,BOOK XII,For better it is by stratagem and craft
8940,BOOK XII,"Now to destroy this city, for whose sake"
8941,BOOK XII,"Hither we came, and still are suffering"
8942,BOOK XII,Many afflictions far from our own land.
8943,BOOK XII,"Come then, and let your hearts be stout and strong"
8944,BOOK XII,For he who in stress of fight hath turned to bay
8945,BOOK XII,"And snatched a desperate courage from despair,"
8946,BOOK XII,"Oft, though the weaker, slays a mightier foe."
8947,BOOK XII,"For courage, which is all men's glory, makes"
8948,BOOK XII,"The heart great.  Come then, set the ambush, ye"
8949,BOOK XII,"Which be our mightiest, and the rest shall go"
8950,BOOK XII,"To Tenedos' hallowed burg, and there abide"
8951,BOOK XII,Until our foes have haled within their walls
8952,BOOK XII,"Us with the Horse, as deeming that they bring"
8953,BOOK XII,"A gift unto Tritonis.  Some brave man,"
8954,BOOK XII,"One whom the Trojans know not, yet we lack,"
8955,BOOK XII,"To harden his heart as steel, and to abide"
8956,BOOK XII,Near by the Horse.  Let that man bear in mind
8957,BOOK XII,Heedfully whatsoe'er I said erewhile.
8958,BOOK XII,"And let none other thought be in his heart,"
8959,BOOK XII,"Lest to the foe our counsel be revealed."""
8960,BOOK XII,
8961,BOOK XII,"Then, when all others feared, a man far-famed"
8962,BOOK XII,"Made answer, Sinon, marked of destiny"
8963,BOOK XII,To bring the great work to accomplishment.
8964,BOOK XII,"Therefore with worship all men looked on him,"
8965,BOOK XII,"The loyal of heart, as in the midst he spake:"
8966,BOOK XII,"""Odysseus, and all ye Achaean chiefs,"
8967,BOOK XII,This work for which ye crave will I perform--
8968,BOOK XII,"Yea, though they torture me, though into fire"
8969,BOOK XII,Living they thrust me; for mine heart is fixed
8970,BOOK XII,"Not to escape, but die by hands of foes,"
8971,BOOK XII,"Except I crown with glory your desire."""
8972,BOOK XII,
8973,BOOK XII,Stoutly he spake: right glad the Argives were;
8974,BOOK XII,"And one said: ""How the Gods have given to-day"
8975,BOOK XII,High courage to this man!  He hath not been
8976,BOOK XII,Heretofore valiant.  Heaven is kindling him
8977,BOOK XII,"To be the Trojans' ruin, but to us"
8978,BOOK XII,"Salvation.  Now full soon, I trow, we reach"
8979,BOOK XII,"The goal of grievous war, so long unseen."""
8980,BOOK XII,
8981,BOOK XII,So a voice murmured mid the Achaean host.
8982,BOOK XII,"Then, to stir up the heroes, Nestor cried:"
8983,BOOK XII,"""Now is the time, dear sons, for courage and strength:"
8984,BOOK XII,Now do the Gods bring nigh the end of toil:
8985,BOOK XII,Now give they victory to our longing hands.
8986,BOOK XII,"Come, bravely enter ye this cavernous Horse."
8987,BOOK XII,For high renown attendeth courage high.
8988,BOOK XII,"Oh that my limbs were mighty as of old,"
8989,BOOK XII,"When Aeson's son for heroes called, to man"
8990,BOOK XII,"Swift Argo, when of the heroes foremost I"
8991,BOOK XII,"Would gladly have entered her, but Pelias"
8992,BOOK XII,The king withheld me in my own despite.
8993,BOOK XII,"Ah me, but now the burden of years--O nay,"
8994,BOOK XII,"As I were young, into the Horse will I"
8995,BOOK XII,"Fearlessly!  Glory and strength shall courage give."""
8996,BOOK XII,
8997,BOOK XII,Answered him golden-haired Achilles' son:
8998,BOOK XII,"""Nestor, in wisdom art thou chief of men;"
8999,BOOK XII,But cruel age hath caught thee in his grip:
9000,BOOK XII,No more thy strength may match thy gallant will;
9001,BOOK XII,Therefore thou needs must unto Tenedos' strand.
9002,BOOK XII,"We will take ambush, we the youths, of strife"
9003,BOOK XII,"Insatiate still, as thou, old sire, dost bid."""
9004,BOOK XII,
9005,BOOK XII,"Then strode the son of Neleus to his side,"
9006,BOOK XII,"And kissed his hands, and kissed the head of him"
9007,BOOK XII,Who offered thus himself the first of all
9008,BOOK XII,"To enter that huge horse, being peril-fain,"
9009,BOOK XII,And bade the elder of days abide without.
9010,BOOK XII,Then to the battle-eager spake the old:
9011,BOOK XII,"""Thy father's son art thou!  Achilles' might"
9012,BOOK XII,"And chivalrous speech be here!  O, sure am I"
9013,BOOK XII,That by thine hands the Argives shall destroy
9014,BOOK XII,"The stately city of Priam.  At the last,"
9015,BOOK XII,"After long travail, glory shall be ours,"
9016,BOOK XII,"Ours, after toil and tribulation of war;"
9017,BOOK XII,The Gods have laid tribulation at men's feet
9018,BOOK XII,"But happiness far off, and toil between:"
9019,BOOK XII,Therefore for men full easy is the path
9020,BOOK XII,"To ruin, and the path to fame is hard,"
9021,BOOK XII,"Where feet must press right on through painful toil."""
9022,BOOK XII,
9023,BOOK XII,He spake: replied Achilles' glorious son:
9024,BOOK XII,"""Old sire, as thine heart trusteth, be it vouchsafed"
9025,BOOK XII,In answer to our prayers; for best were this:
9026,BOOK XII,"But if the Gods will otherwise, be it so."
9027,BOOK XII,"Ay, gladlier would I fall with glory in fight"
9028,BOOK XII,"Than flee from Troy, bowed 'neath a load of shame."""
9029,BOOK XII,
9030,BOOK XII,Then in his sire's celestial arms he arrayed
9031,BOOK XII,His shoulders; and with speed in harness sheathed
9032,BOOK XII,"Stood the most mighty heroes, in whose healers"
9033,BOOK XII,"Was dauntless spirit.  Tell, ye Queens of Song,"
9034,BOOK XII,Now man by man the names of all that passed
9035,BOOK XII,Into the cavernous Horse; for ye inspired
9036,BOOK XII,"My soul with all my song, long ere my cheek"
9037,BOOK XII,"Grew dark with manhood's beard, what time I fed"
9038,BOOK XII,"My goodly sheep on Smyrna's pasture-lea,"
9039,BOOK XII,From Hermus thrice so far as one may hear
9040,BOOK XII,"A man's shout, by the fane of Artemis,"
9041,BOOK XII,"In the Deliverer's Grove, upon a hill"
9042,BOOK XII,Neither exceeding low nor passing high.
9043,BOOK XII,
9044,BOOK XII,Into that cavernous Horse Achilles' son
9045,BOOK XII,"First entered, strong Menelaus followed then,"
9046,BOOK XII,"Odysseus, Sthenelus, godlike Diomede,"
9047,BOOK XII,"Philoctetes and Menestheus, Anticlus,"
9048,BOOK XII,"Thoas and Polypoetes golden-haired,"
9049,BOOK XII,"Aias, Eurypylus, godlike Thrasymede,"
9050,BOOK XII,"Idomeneus, Meriones, far-famous twain,"
9051,BOOK XII,"Podaleirius of spears, Eurymachus,"
9052,BOOK XII,"Teucer the godlike, fierce Ialmenus,"
9053,BOOK XII,"Thalpius, Antimachus, Leonteus staunch,"
9054,BOOK XII,"Eumelus, and Euryalus fair as a God,"
9055,BOOK XII,"Amphimachus, Demophoon, Agapenor,"
9056,BOOK XII,"Akamas, Meges stalwart Phyleus' son--"
9057,BOOK XII,"Yea, more, even all their chiefest, entered in,"
9058,BOOK XII,So many as that carven Horse could hold.
9059,BOOK XII,"Godlike Epeius last of all passed in,"
9060,BOOK XII,The fashioner of the Horse; in his breast lay
9061,BOOK XII,The secret of the opening of its doors
9062,BOOK XII,And of their closing: therefore last of all
9063,BOOK XII,"He entered, and he drew the ladders up"
9064,BOOK XII,"Whereby they clomb: then made he all secure,"
9065,BOOK XII,And set himself beside the bolt.  So all
9066,BOOK XII,In silence sat 'twixt victory and death.
9067,BOOK XII,
9068,BOOK XII,"But the rest fired the tents, wherein erewhile"
9069,BOOK XII,"They slept, and sailed the wide sea in their ships."
9070,BOOK XII,"Two mighty-hearted captains ordered these,"
9071,BOOK XII,Nestor and Agamemnon lord of spears.
9072,BOOK XII,"Fain had they also entered that great Horse,"
9073,BOOK XII,"But all the host withheld them, bidding stay"
9074,BOOK XII,"With them a-shipboard, ordering their array:"
9075,BOOK XII,For men far better work the works of war
9076,BOOK XII,When their kings oversee them; therefore these
9077,BOOK XII,"Abode without, albeit mighty men."
9078,BOOK XII,"So came they swiftly unto Tenedos' shore,"
9079,BOOK XII,"And dropped the anchor-stones, then leapt in haste"
9080,BOOK XII,"Forth of the ships, and silent waited there"
9081,BOOK XII,Keen-watching till the signal-torch should flash.
9082,BOOK XII,
9083,BOOK XII,"But nigh the foe were they in the Horse, and now"
9084,BOOK XII,"Looked they for death, and now to smite the town;"
9085,BOOK XII,And on their hopes and fears uprose the dawn.
9086,BOOK XII,
9087,BOOK XII,Then marked the Trojans upon Hellespont's strand
9088,BOOK XII,The smoke upleaping yet through air: no more
9089,BOOK XII,Saw they the ships which brought to them from Greece
9090,BOOK XII,"Destruction dire.  With joy to the shore they ran,"
9091,BOOK XII,"But armed them first, for fear still haunted them"
9092,BOOK XII,"Then marked they that fair-carven Horse, and stood"
9093,BOOK XII,"Marvelling round, for a mighty work was there."
9094,BOOK XII,"A hapless-seeming man thereby they spied,"
9095,BOOK XII,"Sinon; and this one, that one questioned him"
9096,BOOK XII,"Touching the Danaans, as in a great ring"
9097,BOOK XII,"They compassed him, and with unangry words"
9098,BOOK XII,"First questioned, then with terrible threatenings."
9099,BOOK XII,Then tortured they that man of guileful soul
9100,BOOK XII,Long time unceasing.  Firm as a rock abode
9101,BOOK XII,"The unquivering limbs, the unconquerable will."
9102,BOOK XII,"His ears, his nose, at last they shore away"
9103,BOOK XII,"In every wise tormenting him, until"
9104,BOOK XII,"He should declare the truth, whither were gone"
9105,BOOK XII,"The Danaans in their ships, what thing the Horse"
9106,BOOK XII,Concealed within it.  He had armed his mind
9107,BOOK XII,"With resolution, and of outrage foul"
9108,BOOK XII,"Recked not; his soul endured their cruel stripes,"
9109,BOOK XII,"Yea, and the bitter torment of the fire;"
9110,BOOK XII,For strong endurance into him Hera breathed;
9111,BOOK XII,And still he told them the same guileful tale:
9112,BOOK XII,"""The Argives in their ships flee oversea"
9113,BOOK XII,Weary of tribulation of endless war.
9114,BOOK XII,This horse by Calchas' counsel fashioned they
9115,BOOK XII,"For wise Athena, to propitiate"
9116,BOOK XII,Her stern wrath for that guardian image stol'n
9117,BOOK XII,From Troy.  And by Odysseus' prompting I
9118,BOOK XII,"Was marked for slaughter, to be sacrificed"
9119,BOOK XII,"To the sea-powers, beside the moaning waves,"
9120,BOOK XII,To win them safe return.  But their intent
9121,BOOK XII,"I marked; and ere they spilt the drops of wine,"
9122,BOOK XII,"And sprinkled hallowed meal upon mine head,"
9123,BOOK XII,"Swiftly I fled, and, by the help of Heaven,"
9124,BOOK XII,"I flung me down, clasping the Horse's feet;"
9125,BOOK XII,"And they, sore loth, perforce must leave me there"
9126,BOOK XII,"Dreading great Zeus's daughter mighty-souled."""
9127,BOOK XII,
9128,BOOK XII,"In subtlety so he spake, his soul untamed"
9129,BOOK XII,By pain; for a brave man's part is to endure
9130,BOOK XII,To the uttermost.  And of the Trojans some
9131,BOOK XII,"Believed him, others for a wily knave"
9132,BOOK XII,"Held him, of whose mind was Laocoon."
9133,BOOK XII,"Wisely he spake: ""A deadly fraud is this,"""
9134,BOOK XII,"He said, ""devised by the Achaean chiefs!"""
9135,BOOK XII,"And cried to all straightway to burn the Horse,"
9136,BOOK XII,And know if aught within its timbers lurked.
9137,BOOK XII,
9138,BOOK XII,"Yea, and they had obeyed him, and had 'scaped"
9139,BOOK XII,"Destruction; but Athena, fiercely wroth"
9140,BOOK XII,"With him, the Trojans, and their city, shook"
9141,BOOK XII,Earth's deep foundations 'neath Laocoon's feet.
9142,BOOK XII,"Straight terror fell on him, and trembling bowed"
9143,BOOK XII,The knees of the presumptuous: round his head
9144,BOOK XII,Horror of darkness poured; a sharp pang thrilled
9145,BOOK XII,His eyelids; swam his eyes beneath his brows;
9146,BOOK XII,"His eyeballs, stabbed with bitter anguish, throbbed"
9147,BOOK XII,"Even from the roots, and rolled in frenzy of pain."
9148,BOOK XII,Clear through his brain the bitter torment pierced
9149,BOOK XII,Even to the filmy inner veil thereof;
9150,BOOK XII,"Now bloodshot were his eyes, now ghastly green;"
9151,BOOK XII,"Anon with rheum they ran, as pours a stream"
9152,BOOK XII,"Down from a rugged crag, with thawing snow"
9153,BOOK XII,Made turbid.  As a man distraught he seemed:
9154,BOOK XII,"All things he saw showed double, and he groaned"
9155,BOOK XII,Fearfully; yet he ceased not to exhort
9156,BOOK XII,"The men of Troy, and recked not of his pain."
9157,BOOK XII,Then did the Goddess strike him utterly blind.
9158,BOOK XII,Stared his fixed eyeballs white from pits of blood;
9159,BOOK XII,"And all folk groaned for pity of their friend,"
9160,BOOK XII,"And dread of the Prey-giver, lest he had sinned"
9161,BOOK XII,"In folly against her, and his mind was thus"
9162,BOOK XII,"Warped to destruction yea, lest on themselves"
9163,BOOK XII,"Like judgment should be visited, to avenge"
9164,BOOK XII,"The outrage done to hapless Sinon's flesh,"
9165,BOOK XII,Whereby they hoped to wring the truth from him.
9166,BOOK XII,"So led they him in friendly wise to Troy,"
9167,BOOK XII,"Pitying him at the last.  Then gathered all,"
9168,BOOK XII,"And o'er that huge Horse hastily cast a rope,"
9169,BOOK XII,And made it fast above; for under its feet
9170,BOOK XII,"Smooth wooden rollers had Epeius laid,"
9171,BOOK XII,"That, dragged by Trojan hands, it might glide on"
9172,BOOK XII,Into their fortress.  One and all they haled
9173,BOOK XII,"With multitudinous tug and strain, as when"
9174,BOOK XII,Down to the sea young men sore-labouring drag
9175,BOOK XII,"A ship; hard-crushed the stubborn rollers groan,"
9176,BOOK XII,"As, sliding with weird shrieks, the keel descends"
9177,BOOK XII,Into the sea-surge; so that host with toil
9178,BOOK XII,"Dragged up unto their city their own doom,"
9179,BOOK XII,Epeius' work.  With great festoons of flowers
9180,BOOK XII,"They hung it, and their own heads did they wreathe,"
9181,BOOK XII,While answering each other pealed the flutes.
9182,BOOK XII,"Grimly Enyo laughed, seeing the end"
9183,BOOK XII,Of that dire war; Hera rejoiced on high;
9184,BOOK XII,Glad was Athena.  When the Trojans came
9185,BOOK XII,"Unto their city, brake they down the walls,"
9186,BOOK XII,"Their city's coronal, that the Horse of Death"
9187,BOOK XII,Might be led in.  Troy's daughters greeted it
9188,BOOK XII,With shouts of salutation; marvelling all
9189,BOOK XII,Gazed at the mighty work where lurked their doom.
9190,BOOK XII,
9191,BOOK XII,But still Laocoon ceased not to exhort
9192,BOOK XII,His countrymen to burn the Horse with fire:
9193,BOOK XII,"They would not hear, for dread of the Gods' wrath."
9194,BOOK XII,But then a yet more hideous punishment
9195,BOOK XII,Athena visited on his hapless sons.
9196,BOOK XII,"A cave there was, beneath a rugged cliff"
9197,BOOK XII,"Exceeding high, unscalable, wherein"
9198,BOOK XII,Dwelt fearful monsters of the deadly brood
9199,BOOK XII,"Of Typhon, in the rock-clefts of the isle"
9200,BOOK XII,Calydna that looks Troyward from the sea.
9201,BOOK XII,"Thence stirred she up the strength of serpents twain,"
9202,BOOK XII,And summoned them to Troy.  By her uproused
9203,BOOK XII,They shook the island as with earthquake: roared
9204,BOOK XII,The sea; the waves disparted as they came.
9205,BOOK XII,Onward they swept with fearful-flickering tongues:
9206,BOOK XII,Shuddered the very monsters of the deep:
9207,BOOK XII,"Xanthus' and Simois' daughters moaned aloud,"
9208,BOOK XII,The River-nymphs: the Cyprian Queen looked down
9209,BOOK XII,In anguish from Olympus.  Swiftly they came
9210,BOOK XII,Whither the Goddess sped them: with grim jaws
9211,BOOK XII,"Whetting their deadly fangs, on his hapless sons"
9212,BOOK XII,"Sprang they.  All Trojans panic-stricken fled,"
9213,BOOK XII,Seeing those fearsome dragons in their town.
9214,BOOK XII,"No man, though ne'er so dauntless theretofore,"
9215,BOOK XII,Dared tarry; ghastly dread laid hold on all
9216,BOOK XII,Shrinking in horror from the monsters. Screamed
9217,BOOK XII,"The women; yea, the mother forgat her child,"
9218,BOOK XII,Fear-frenzied as she fled: all Troy became
9219,BOOK XII,"One shriek of fleers, one huddle of jostling limbs:"
9220,BOOK XII,The streets were choked with cowering fugitives.
9221,BOOK XII,"Alone was left Laocoon with his sons,"
9222,BOOK XII,For death's doom and the Goddess chained their feet.
9223,BOOK XII,"Then, even as from destruction shrank the lads,"
9224,BOOK XII,Those deadly fangs had seized and ravined up
9225,BOOK XII,"The twain, outstretching to their sightless sire"
9226,BOOK XII,Agonized hands: no power to help had he.
9227,BOOK XII,Trojans far off looked on from every side
9228,BOOK XII,"Weeping, all dazed.  And, having now fulfilled"
9229,BOOK XII,"Upon the Trojans Pallas' awful hest,"
9230,BOOK XII,Those monsters vanished 'neath the earth; and still
9231,BOOK XII,"Stands their memorial, where into the fane"
9232,BOOK XII,They entered of Apollo in Pergamus
9233,BOOK XII,The hallowed.  Therebefore the sons of Troy
9234,BOOK XII,"Gathered, and reared a cenotaph for those"
9235,BOOK XII,Who miserably had perished.  Over it
9236,BOOK XII,Their father from his blind eyes rained the tears:
9237,BOOK XII,"Over the empty tomb their mother shrieked,"
9238,BOOK XII,"Boding the while yet worse things, wailing o'er"
9239,BOOK XII,"The ruin wrought by folly of her lord,"
9240,BOOK XII,Dreading the anger of the Blessed Ones.
9241,BOOK XII,As when around her void nest in a brake
9242,BOOK XII,In sorest anguish moans the nightingale
9243,BOOK XII,"Whose fledglings, ere they learned her plaintive song,"
9244,BOOK XII,"A hideous serpent's fangs have done to death,"
9245,BOOK XII,"And left the mother anguish, endless woe,"
9246,BOOK XII,And bootless crying round her desolate home;
9247,BOOK XII,"So groaned she for her children's wretched death,"
9248,BOOK XII,So moaned she o'er the void tomb; and her pangs
9249,BOOK XII,Were sharpened by her lord's plight stricken blind.
9250,BOOK XII,
9251,BOOK XII,While she for children and for husband moaned--
9252,BOOK XII,"These slain, he of the sun's light portionless--"
9253,BOOK XII,"The Trojans to the Immortals sacrificed,"
9254,BOOK XII,Pouring the wine.  Their hearts beat high with hope
9255,BOOK XII,To escape the weary stress of woeful war.
9256,BOOK XII,"Howbeit the victims burned not, and the flames"
9257,BOOK XII,"Died out, as though 'neath heavy-hissing rain;"
9258,BOOK XII,"And writhed the smoke-wreaths blood-red, and the thighs"
9259,BOOK XII,Quivering from crumbling altars fell to earth.
9260,BOOK XII,"Drink-offerings turned to blood, Gods' statues wept,"
9261,BOOK XII,And temple-walls dripped gore: along them rolled
9262,BOOK XII,Echoes of groaning out of depths unseen;
9263,BOOK XII,And all the long walls shuddered: from the towers
9264,BOOK XII,Came quick sharp sounds like cries of men in pain;
9265,BOOK XII,"And, weirdly shrieking, of themselves slid back"
9266,BOOK XII,"The gate-bolts.  Screaming ""Desolation!"" wailed"
9267,BOOK XII,The birds of night.  Above that God-built burg
9268,BOOK XII,A mist palled every star; and yet no cloud
9269,BOOK XII,Was in the flashing heavens.  By Phoebus' fane
9270,BOOK XII,Withered the bays that erst were lush and green.
9271,BOOK XII,Wolves and foul-feeding jackals came and howled
9272,BOOK XII,"Within the gates.  Ay, other signs untold"
9273,BOOK XII,"Appeared, portending woe to Dardanus' sons"
9274,BOOK XII,And Troy: yet no fear touched the Trojans' hearts
9275,BOOK XII,Who saw all through the town those portents dire:
9276,BOOK XII,"Fate crazed them all, that midst their revelling"
9277,BOOK XII,Slain by their foes they might fill up their doom.
9278,BOOK XII,
9279,BOOK XII,"One heart was steadfast, and one soul clear-eyed,"
9280,BOOK XII,Cassandra.  Never her words were unfulfilled;
9281,BOOK XII,"Yet was their utter truth, by Fate's decree,"
9282,BOOK XII,"Ever as idle wind in the hearers' ears,"
9283,BOOK XII,That no bar to Troy's ruin might be set.
9284,BOOK XII,She saw those evil portents all through Troy
9285,BOOK XII,"Conspiring to one end; loud rang her cry,"
9286,BOOK XII,As roars a lioness that mid the brakes
9287,BOOK XII,"A hunter has stabbed or shot, whereat her heart"
9288,BOOK XII,"Maddens, and down the long hills rolls her roar,"
9289,BOOK XII,And her might waxes tenfold; so with heart
9290,BOOK XII,Aflame with prophecy came she forth her bower.
9291,BOOK XII,Over her snowy shoulders tossed her hair
9292,BOOK XII,"Streaming far down, and wildly blazed her eyes."
9293,BOOK XII,"Her neck writhed, like a sapling in the wind"
9294,BOOK XII,"Shaken, as moaned and shrieked that noble maid:"
9295,BOOK XII,"""O wretches!  into the Land of Darkness now"
9296,BOOK XII,We are passing; for all round us full of fire
9297,BOOK XII,And blood and dismal moan the city is.
9298,BOOK XII,Everywhere portents of calamity
9299,BOOK XII,Gods show: destruction yawns before your feet.
9300,BOOK XII,Fools!  ye know not your doom: still ye rejoice
9301,BOOK XII,"With one consent in madness, who to Troy"
9302,BOOK XII,Have brought the Argive Horse where ruin lurks!
9303,BOOK XII,"Oh, ye believe not me, though ne'er so loud"
9304,BOOK XII,"I cry!  The Erinyes and the ruthless Fates,"
9305,BOOK XII,"For Helen's spousals madly wroth, through Troy"
9306,BOOK XII,"Dart on wild wings.  And ye, ye are banqueting there"
9307,BOOK XII,"In your last feast, on meats befouled with gore,"
9308,BOOK XII,"When now your feet are on the Path of Ghosts!"""
9309,BOOK XII,
9310,BOOK XII,Then cried a scoffing voice an ominous word:
9311,BOOK XII,"""Why doth a raving tongue of evil speech,"
9312,BOOK XII,"Daughter of Priam, make thy lips to cry"
9313,BOOK XII,Words empty as wind?  No maiden modesty
9314,BOOK XII,With purity veils thee: thou art compassed round
9315,BOOK XII,With ruinous madness; therefore all men scorn
9316,BOOK XII,"Thee, babbler!  Hence, thine evil bodings speak"
9317,BOOK XII,To the Argives and thyself!  For thee doth wait
9318,BOOK XII,Anguish and shame yet bitterer than befell
9319,BOOK XII,Presumptuous Laocoon.  Shame it were
9320,BOOK XII,"In folly to destroy the Immortals' gift."""
9321,BOOK XII,
9322,BOOK XII,So scoffed a Trojan: others in like sort
9323,BOOK XII,"Cried shame on her, and said she spake but lies,"
9324,BOOK XII,Saying that ruin and Fate's heavy stroke
9325,BOOK XII,"Were hard at hand.  They knew not their own doom,"
9326,BOOK XII,"And mocked, and thrust her back from that huge Horse"
9327,BOOK XII,"For fain she was to smite its beams apart,"
9328,BOOK XII,Or burn with ravening fire.  She snatched a brand
9329,BOOK XII,Of blazing pine-wood from the hearth and ran
9330,BOOK XII,In fury: in the other hand she bare
9331,BOOK XII,A two-edged halberd: on that Horse of Doom
9332,BOOK XII,"She rushed, to cause the Trojans to behold"
9333,BOOK XII,With their own eyes the ambush hidden there.
9334,BOOK XII,But straightway from her hands they plucked and flung
9335,BOOK XII,"Afar the fire and steel, and careless turned"
9336,BOOK XII,To the feast; for darkened o'er them their last night.
9337,BOOK XII,Within the horse the Argives joyed to hear
9338,BOOK XII,The uproar of Troy's feasters setting at naught
9339,BOOK XII,"Cassandra, but they marvelled that she knew"
9340,BOOK XII,So well the Achaeans' purpose and device.
9341,BOOK XII,
9342,BOOK XII,"As mid the hills a furious pantheress,"
9343,BOOK XII,Which from the steading hounds and shepherd-folk
9344,BOOK XII,"Drive with fierce rush, with savage heart turns back"
9345,BOOK XII,"Even in departing, galled albeit by darts:"
9346,BOOK XII,"So from the great Horse fled she, anguish-racked"
9347,BOOK XII,"For Troy, for all the ruin she foreknew."
9348,BOOK XII,
9349,BOOK XII,
9350,BOOK XII,
9351,BOOK XIII,BOOK XIII
9352,BOOK XIII,
9353,BOOK XIII,How Troy in the night was taken and sacked with fire and slaughter.
9354,BOOK XIII,
9355,BOOK XIII,
9356,BOOK XIII,"So feasted they through Troy, and in their midst"
9357,BOOK XIII,Loud pealed the flutes and pipes: on every hand
9358,BOOK XIII,"Were song and dance, laughter and cries confused"
9359,BOOK XIII,Of banqueters beside the meats and wine.
9360,BOOK XIII,"They, lifting in their hands the beakers brimmed,"
9361,BOOK XIII,"Recklessly drank, till heavy of brain they grew,"
9362,BOOK XIII,Till rolled their fluctuant eyes.  Now and again
9363,BOOK XIII,Some mouth would babble the drunkard's broken words.
9364,BOOK XIII,"The household gear, the very roof and walls"
9365,BOOK XIII,Seemed as they rocked: all things they looked on seemed
9366,BOOK XIII,Whirled in wild dance.  About their eyes a veil
9367,BOOK XIII,"Of mist dropped, for the drunkard's sight is dimmed,"
9368,BOOK XIII,"And the wit dulled, when rise the fumes to the brain:"
9369,BOOK XIII,And thus a heavy-headed feaster cried:
9370,BOOK XIII,"""For naught the Danaans mustered that great host"
9371,BOOK XIII,"Hither!  Fools, they have wrought not their intent,"
9372,BOOK XIII,But with hopes unaccomplished from our town
9373,BOOK XIII,"Like silly boys or women have they fled."""
9374,BOOK XIII,
9375,BOOK XIII,"So cried a Trojan wit-befogged with wine,"
9376,BOOK XIII,"Fool, nor discerned destruction at the doors."
9377,BOOK XIII,
9378,BOOK XIII,When sleep had locked his fetters everywhere
9379,BOOK XIII,"Through Troy on folk fulfilled of wine and meat,"
9380,BOOK XIII,Then Sinon lifted high a blazing torch
9381,BOOK XIII,To show the Argive men the splendour of fire.
9382,BOOK XIII,"But fearfully the while his heart beat, lest"
9383,BOOK XIII,"The men of Troy might see it, and the plot"
9384,BOOK XIII,Be suddenly revealed.  But on their beds
9385,BOOK XIII,"Sleeping their last sleep lay they, heavy with wine."
9386,BOOK XIII,"The host saw, and from Tenedos set sail."
9387,BOOK XIII,
9388,BOOK XIII,"Then nigh the Horse drew Sinon: softly he called,"
9389,BOOK XIII,"Full softly, that no man of Troy might hear,"
9390,BOOK XIII,"But only Achaea's chiefs, far from whose eyes"
9391,BOOK XIII,"Sleep hovered, so athirst were they for fight."
9392,BOOK XIII,"They heard, and to Odysseus all inclined"
9393,BOOK XIII,Their ears: he bade them urgently go forth
9394,BOOK XIII,Softly and fearlessly; and they obeyed
9395,BOOK XIII,"That battle-summons, pressing in hot haste"
9396,BOOK XIII,To leap to earth: but in his subtlety
9397,BOOK XIII,He stayed them from all thrusting eagerly forth.
9398,BOOK XIII,"But first himself with swift unfaltering hands,"
9399,BOOK XIII,"Helped of Epeius, here and there unbarred"
9400,BOOK XIII,The ribs of the Horse of beams: above the planks
9401,BOOK XIII,"A little he raised his head, and gazed around"
9402,BOOK XIII,"On all sides, if he haply might descry"
9403,BOOK XIII,"One Trojan waking yet.  As when a wolf,"
9404,BOOK XIII,"With hunger stung to the heart, comes from the hills,"
9405,BOOK XIII,And ravenous for flesh draws nigh the flock
9406,BOOK XIII,"Penned in the wide fold, slinking past the men"
9407,BOOK XIII,"And dogs that watch, all keen to ward the sheep,"
9408,BOOK XIII,Then o'er the fold-wall leaps with soundless feet;
9409,BOOK XIII,So stole Odysseus down from the Horse: with him
9410,BOOK XIII,"Followed the war-fain lords of Hellas' League,"
9411,BOOK XIII,"Orderly stepping down the ladders, which"
9412,BOOK XIII,"Epeius framed for paths of mighty men,"
9413,BOOK XIII,"For entering and for passing forth the Horse,"
9414,BOOK XIII,"Who down them now on this side, that side, streamed"
9415,BOOK XIII,As fearless wasps startled by stroke of axe
9416,BOOK XIII,In angry mood pour all together forth
9417,BOOK XIII,"From the tree-bole, at sound of woodman's blow;"
9418,BOOK XIII,So battle-kindled forth the Horse they poured
9419,BOOK XIII,Into the midst of that strong city of Troy
9420,BOOK XIII,With hearts that leapt expectant.  [With swift hands
9421,BOOK XIII,"Snatched they the brands from dying hearths, and fired"
9422,BOOK XIII,Temple and palace.  Onward then to the gates
9423,BOOK XIII,"Sped they,] and swiftly slew the slumbering guards,"
9424,BOOK XIII,[Then held the gate-towers till their friends should come.]
9425,BOOK XIII,Fast rowed the host the while; on swept the ships
9426,BOOK XIII,Over the great flood: Thetis made their paths
9427,BOOK XIII,"Straight, and behind them sent a driving wind"
9428,BOOK XIII,"Speeding them, and the hearts Achaean glowed."
9429,BOOK XIII,"Swiftly to Hellespont's shore they came, and there"
9430,BOOK XIII,"Beached they the keels again, and deftly dealt"
9431,BOOK XIII,With whatso tackling appertains to ships.
9432,BOOK XIII,"Then leapt they aland, and hasted on to Troy"
9433,BOOK XIII,Silent as sheep that hurry to the fold
9434,BOOK XIII,From woodland pasture on an autumn eve;
9435,BOOK XIII,So without sound of voices marched they on
9436,BOOK XIII,"Unto the Trojans' fortress, eager all"
9437,BOOK XIII,To help those mighty chiefs with foes begirt.
9438,BOOK XIII,Now these--as famished wolves fierce-glaring round
9439,BOOK XIII,"Fall on a fold mid the long forest-hills,"
9440,BOOK XIII,"While sleeps the toil-worn watchman, and they rend"
9441,BOOK XIII,The sheep on every hand within the wall
9442,BOOK XIII,"In darkness, and all round [are heaped the slain;"
9443,BOOK XIII,"So these within the city smote and slew,"
9444,BOOK XIII,"As swarmed the awakened foe around them; yet,"
9445,BOOK XIII,"Fast as they slew, aye faster closed on them"
9446,BOOK XIII,"Those thousands, mad to thrust them from the gates.]"
9447,BOOK XIII,Slipping in blood and stumbling o'er the dead
9448,BOOK XIII,"[Their line reeled,] and destruction loomed o'er them,"
9449,BOOK XIII,Though Danaan thousands near and nearer drew.
9450,BOOK XIII,
9451,BOOK XIII,"But when the whole host reached the walls of Troy,"
9452,BOOK XIII,"Into the city of Priam, breathing rage"
9453,BOOK XIII,"Of fight, with reckless battle-lust they poured;"
9454,BOOK XIII,And all that fortress found they full of war
9455,BOOK XIII,"And slaughter, palaces, temples, horribly"
9456,BOOK XIII,Blazing on all sides; glowed their hearts with joy.
9457,BOOK XIII,In deadly mood then charged they on the foe.
9458,BOOK XIII,Ares and fell Enyo maddened there:
9459,BOOK XIII,"Blood ran in torrents, drenched was all the earth,"
9460,BOOK XIII,As Trojans and their alien helpers died.
9461,BOOK XIII,Here were men lying quelled by bitter death
9462,BOOK XIII,All up and down the city in their blood;
9463,BOOK XIII,"Others on them were falling, gasping forth"
9464,BOOK XIII,"Their life's strength; others, clutching in their hands"
9465,BOOK XIII,"Their bowels that looked through hideous gashes forth,"
9466,BOOK XIII,Wandered in wretched plight around their homes:
9467,BOOK XIII,"Others, whose feet, while yet asleep they lay,"
9468,BOOK XIII,"Had been hewn off, with groans unutterable"
9469,BOOK XIII,"Crawled mid the corpses.  Some, who had rushed to fight,"
9470,BOOK XIII,"Lay now in dust, with hands and heads hewn off."
9471,BOOK XIII,"Some were there, through whose backs, even as they fled,"
9472,BOOK XIII,"The spear had passed, clear through to the breast, and some"
9473,BOOK XIII,"Whose waists the lance had pierced, impaling them"
9474,BOOK XIII,Where sharpest stings the anguish-laden steel.
9475,BOOK XIII,And all about the city dolorous howls
9476,BOOK XIII,"Of dogs uprose, and miserable moans"
9477,BOOK XIII,Of strong men stricken to death; and every home
9478,BOOK XIII,With awful cries was echoing.  Rang the shrieks
9479,BOOK XIII,"Of women, like to screams of cranes, which see"
9480,BOOK XIII,"An eagle stooping on them from the sky,"
9481,BOOK XIII,"Which have no courage to resist, but scream"
9482,BOOK XIII,Long terror-shrieks in dread of Zeus's bird;
9483,BOOK XIII,"So here, so there the Trojan women wailed,"
9484,BOOK XIII,"Some starting from their sleep, some to the ground"
9485,BOOK XIII,Leaping: they thought not in that agony
9486,BOOK XIII,Of robe and zone; in naught but tunics clad
9487,BOOK XIII,Distraught they wandered: others found nor veil
9488,BOOK XIII,"Nor cloak to cast about them, but, as came"
9489,BOOK XIII,"Onward their foes, they stood with beating hearts"
9490,BOOK XIII,"Trembling, as lettered by despair, essaying,"
9491,BOOK XIII,"All-hapless, with their hands alone to hide"
9492,BOOK XIII,Their nakedness.  And some in frenzy of woe:
9493,BOOK XIII,"Their tresses tore, and beat their breasts, and screamed."
9494,BOOK XIII,Others against that stormy torrent of foes
9495,BOOK XIII,"Recklessly rushed, insensible of fear,"
9496,BOOK XIII,"Through mad desire to aid the perishing,"
9497,BOOK XIII,Husbands or children; for despair had given
9498,BOOK XIII,High courage.  Shrieks had startled from their sleep
9499,BOOK XIII,Soft little babes whose hearts had never known
9500,BOOK XIII,Trouble--and there one with another lay
9501,BOOK XIII,Gasping their lives out!  Some there were whose dreams
9502,BOOK XIII,Changed to a sudden vision of doom.  All round
9503,BOOK XIII,The fell Fates gloated horribly o'er the slain.
9504,BOOK XIII,And even as swine be slaughtered in the court
9505,BOOK XIII,"Of a rich king who makes his folk a feast,"
9506,BOOK XIII,So without number were they slain.  The wine
9507,BOOK XIII,Left in the mixing-bowls was blent with blood
9508,BOOK XIII,Gruesomely.  No man bare a sword unstained
9509,BOOK XIII,"With murder of defenceless folk of Troy,"
9510,BOOK XIII,Though he were but a weakling in fair fight.
9511,BOOK XIII,"And as by wolves or jackals sheep are torn,"
9512,BOOK XIII,What time the furnace-breath of midnoon-heat
9513,BOOK XIII,"Darts down, and all the flock beneath the shade"
9514,BOOK XIII,"Are crowded, and the shepherd is not there,"
9515,BOOK XIII,But to the homestead bears afar their milk;
9516,BOOK XIII,"And the fierce brutes leap on them, tear their throats,"
9517,BOOK XIII,"Gorge to the full their ravenous maws, and then"
9518,BOOK XIII,"Lap the dark blood, and linger still to slay"
9519,BOOK XIII,"All in mere lust of slaughter, and provide"
9520,BOOK XIII,An evil banquet for that shepherd-lord;
9521,BOOK XIII,So through the city of Priam Danaans slew
9522,BOOK XIII,One after other in that last fight of all.
9523,BOOK XIII,"No Trojan there was woundless, all men's limbs"
9524,BOOK XIII,With blood in torrents spilt were darkly dashed.
9525,BOOK XIII,
9526,BOOK XIII,Nor seetheless were the Danaans in the fray:
9527,BOOK XIII,"With beakers some were smitten, with tables some,"
9528,BOOK XIII,Thrust in the eyes of some were burning brands
9529,BOOK XIII,Snatched from the hearth; some died transfixed with spits
9530,BOOK XIII,Yet left within the hot flesh of the swine
9531,BOOK XIII,Whereon the red breath of the Fire-god beat;
9532,BOOK XIII,Others struck down by bills and axes keen
9533,BOOK XIII,Gasped in their blood: from some men's hands were shorn
9534,BOOK XIII,"The fingers, who, in wild hope to escape"
9535,BOOK XIII,"The imminent death, had clutched the blades of swords."
9536,BOOK XIII,And here in that dark tumult one had hurled
9537,BOOK XIII,"A stone, and crushed the crown of a friend's head."
9538,BOOK XIII,Like wild beasts trapped and stabbed within a fold
9539,BOOK XIII,"On a lone steading, frenziedly they fought,"
9540,BOOK XIII,"Mad with despair-enkindled rage, beneath"
9541,BOOK XIII,That night of horror.  Hot with battle-lust
9542,BOOK XIII,"Here, there, the fighters rushed and hurried through"
9543,BOOK XIII,The palace of Priam.  Many an Argive fell
9544,BOOK XIII,Spear-slain; for whatso Trojan in his halls
9545,BOOK XIII,"Might seize a sword, might lift a spear in hand,"
9546,BOOK XIII,"Slew foes--ay, heavy though he were with wine."
9547,BOOK XIII,
9548,BOOK XIII,"Upflashed a glare unearthly through the town,"
9549,BOOK XIII,For many an Argive bare in hand a torch
9550,BOOK XIII,To know in that dim battle friends from foes.
9551,BOOK XIII,
9552,BOOK XIII,Then Tydeus' son amid the war-storm met
9553,BOOK XIII,"Spearman Coroebus, lordly Mygdon's son,"
9554,BOOK XIII,And 'neath the left ribs pierced him with the lance
9555,BOOK XIII,Where run the life-ways of man's meat and drink;
9556,BOOK XIII,So met him black death borne upon the spear:
9557,BOOK XIII,Down in dark blood he fell mid hosts of slain.
9558,BOOK XIII,"Ah fool!  the bride he won not, Priam's child"
9559,BOOK XIII,"Cassandra, yea, his loveliest, for whose sake"
9560,BOOK XIII,"To Priam's burg but yesterday he came,"
9561,BOOK XIII,And vaunted he would thrust the Argives back
9562,BOOK XIII,From Ilium.  Never did the Gods fulfil
9563,BOOK XIII,His hope: the Fates hurled doom upon his head.
9564,BOOK XIII,"With him the slayer laid Eurydamas low,"
9565,BOOK XIII,"Antenor's gallant son-in-law, who most"
9566,BOOK XIII,For prudence was pre-eminent in Troy.
9567,BOOK XIII,"Then met he Ilioneus the elder of days,"
9568,BOOK XIII,And flashed his terrible sword forth.  All the limbs
9569,BOOK XIII,Of that grey sire were palsied with his fear:
9570,BOOK XIII,"He put forth trembling hands, with one he caught"
9571,BOOK XIII,"The swift avenging sword, with one he clasped"
9572,BOOK XIII,"The hero's knees.  Despite his fury of war,"
9573,BOOK XIII,"A moment paused his wrath, or haply a God"
9574,BOOK XIII,"Held back the sword a space, that that old man"
9575,BOOK XIII,Might speak to his fierce foe one word of prayer.
9576,BOOK XIII,"Piteously cried he, terror-overwhelmed:"
9577,BOOK XIII,"""I kneel before thee, whosoe'er thou be"
9578,BOOK XIII,Of mighty Argives.  Oh compassionate
9579,BOOK XIII,My suppliant hands!  Abate thy wrath!  To slay
9580,BOOK XIII,The young and valiant is a glorious thing;
9581,BOOK XIII,"But if thou smite an old man, small renown"
9582,BOOK XIII,Waits on thy prowess.  Therefore turn from me
9583,BOOK XIII,"Thine hands against young men, if thou dost hope"
9584,BOOK XIII,"Ever to come to grey hairs such as mine."""
9585,BOOK XIII,
9586,BOOK XIII,So spake he; but replied strong Tydeus' son:
9587,BOOK XIII,"""Old man, I look to attain to honoured age;"
9588,BOOK XIII,"But while my Strength yet waxeth, will not I"
9589,BOOK XIII,"Spare any foe, but hurl to Hades all."
9590,BOOK XIII,"The brave man makes an end of every foe."""
9591,BOOK XIII,
9592,BOOK XIII,Then through his throat that terrible warrior drave
9593,BOOK XIII,"The deadly blade, and thrust it straight to where"
9594,BOOK XIII,The paths of man's life lead by swiftest way
9595,BOOK XIII,Blood-paved to doom: death palsied his poor strength
9596,BOOK XIII,By Diomedes' hands.  Thence rushed he on
9597,BOOK XIII,"Slaying the Trojans, storming in his might"
9598,BOOK XIII,All through their fortress: pierced by his long spear
9599,BOOK XIII,"Eurycoon fell, Perimnestor's son renowned."
9600,BOOK XIII,Amphimedon Aias slew: Agamemnon smote
9601,BOOK XIII,Damastor's son: Idomeneus struck down
9602,BOOK XIII,Mimas: by Meges Deiopites died.
9603,BOOK XIII,
9604,BOOK XIII,Achilles' son with his resistless lance
9605,BOOK XIII,Smote godlike Pammon; then his javelin pierced
9606,BOOK XIII,Polites in mid-rush: Antiphonus
9607,BOOK XIII,"Dead upon these he laid, all Priam's sons."
9608,BOOK XIII,"Agenor faced him in the fight, and fell:"
9609,BOOK XIII,Hero on hero slew he; everywhere
9610,BOOK XIII,Stalked at his side Death's black doom manifest:
9611,BOOK XIII,"Clad in his sire's might, whomso he met he slew."
9612,BOOK XIII,"Last, on Troy's king in murderous mood he came."
9613,BOOK XIII,"By Zeus the Hearth-lord's altar.  Seeing him,"
9614,BOOK XIII,Old Priam knew him and quaked not; for he longed
9615,BOOK XIII,Himself to lay his life down midst his sons;
9616,BOOK XIII,And craving death to Achilles' seed he spake:
9617,BOOK XIII,"""Fierce-hearted son of Achilles strong in war,"
9618,BOOK XIII,"Slay me, and pity not my misery."
9619,BOOK XIII,"I have no will to see the sun's light more,"
9620,BOOK XIII,Who have suffered woes so many and so dread.
9621,BOOK XIII,"With my sons would I die, and so forget"
9622,BOOK XIII,Anguish and horror of war.  Oh that thy sire
9623,BOOK XIII,"Had slain me, ere mine eyes beheld aflame"
9624,BOOK XIII,"Illium, had slain me when I brought to him"
9625,BOOK XIII,"Ransom for Hector, whom thy father slew."
9626,BOOK XIII,He spared me--so the Fates had spun my thread
9627,BOOK XIII,"Of destiny.  But thou, glut with my blood"
9628,BOOK XIII,"Thy fierce heart, and let me forget my pain."""
9629,BOOK XIII,Answered Achilles' battle-eager son:
9630,BOOK XIII,"""Fain am I, yea, in haste to grant thy prayer."
9631,BOOK XIII,A foe like thee will I not leave alive;
9632,BOOK XIII,"For naught is dearer unto men than life."""
9633,BOOK XIII,
9634,BOOK XIII,With one stroke swept he off that hoary head
9635,BOOK XIII,Lightly as when a reaper lops an ear
9636,BOOK XIII,In a parched cornfield at the harvest-tide.
9637,BOOK XIII,With lips yet murmuring low it rolled afar
9638,BOOK XIII,From where with quivering limbs the body lay
9639,BOOK XIII,Amidst dark-purple blood and slaughtered men.
9640,BOOK XIII,"So lay he, chiefest once of all the world"
9641,BOOK XIII,"In lineage, wealth, in many and goodly sons."
9642,BOOK XIII,"Ah me, not long abides the honour of man,"
9643,BOOK XIII,But shame from unseen ambush leaps on him
9644,BOOK XIII,"So clutched him Doom, so he forgat his woes."
9645,BOOK XIII,
9646,BOOK XIII,"Yea, also did those Danaan car-lords hurl"
9647,BOOK XIII,"From a high tower the babe Astyanax,"
9648,BOOK XIII,Dashing him out of life.  They tore the child
9649,BOOK XIII,"Out of his mother's arms, in wrathful hate"
9650,BOOK XIII,"Of Hector, who in life had dealt to them"
9651,BOOK XIII,"Such havoc; therefore hated they his seed,"
9652,BOOK XIII,And down from that high rampart flung his child--
9653,BOOK XIII,A wordless babe that nothing knew of war!
9654,BOOK XIII,As when amid the mountains hungry wolves
9655,BOOK XIII,"Chase from the mother's side a suckling calf,"
9656,BOOK XIII,And with malignant cunning drive it o'er
9657,BOOK XIII,"An echoing cliffs edge, while runs to and fro"
9658,BOOK XIII,"Its dam with long moans mourning her dear child,"
9659,BOOK XIII,"And a new evil followeth hard on her,"
9660,BOOK XIII,For suddenly lions seize her for a prey;
9661,BOOK XIII,"So, as she agonized for her son, the foe"
9662,BOOK XIII,To bondage haled with other captive thralls
9663,BOOK XIII,That shrieking daughter of King Eetion.
9664,BOOK XIII,"Then, as on those three fearful deaths she thought"
9665,BOOK XIII,"Of husband, child, and father, Andromaehe"
9666,BOOK XIII,"Longed sore to die.  Yea, for the royally-born"
9667,BOOK XIII,"Better it is to die in war, than do"
9668,BOOK XIII,The service of the thrall to baser folk.
9669,BOOK XIII,All piteously the broken-hearted cried:
9670,BOOK XIII,"""Oh hurl my body also from the wall,"
9671,BOOK XIII,"Or down the cliff, or cast me midst the fire,"
9672,BOOK XIII,Ye Argives!  Woes are mine unutterable!
9673,BOOK XIII,For Peleus' son smote down my noble father
9674,BOOK XIII,"In Thebe, and in Troy mine husband slew,"
9675,BOOK XIII,"Who unto me was all mine heart's desire,"
9676,BOOK XIII,"Who left me in mine halls one little child,"
9677,BOOK XIII,My darling and my pride--of all mine hopes
9678,BOOK XIII,In him fell merciless Fate hath cheated me!
9679,BOOK XIII,Oh therefore thrust this broken-hearted one
9680,BOOK XIII,Now out of life!  Hale me not overseas
9681,BOOK XIII,Mingled with spear-thralls; for my soul henceforth
9682,BOOK XIII,"Hath no more pleasure in life, since God hath slain"
9683,BOOK XIII,My nearest and my dearest!  For me waits
9684,BOOK XIII,"Trouble and anguish and lone homelessness!"""
9685,BOOK XIII,
9686,BOOK XIII,"So cried she, longing for the grave; for vile"
9687,BOOK XIII,Is life to them whose glory is swallowed up
9688,BOOK XIII,Of shame: a horror is the scorn of men.
9689,BOOK XIII,"But, spite her prayers, to thraldom dragged they her."
9690,BOOK XIII,
9691,BOOK XIII,"In all the homes of Troy lay dying men,"
9692,BOOK XIII,"And rose from all a lamentable cry,"
9693,BOOK XIII,Save only Antenor's halls; for unto him
9694,BOOK XIII,"The Argives rendered hospitality's debt,"
9695,BOOK XIII,For that in time past had his roof received
9696,BOOK XIII,"And sheltered godlike Menelaus, when"
9697,BOOK XIII,He with Odysseus came to claim his own.
9698,BOOK XIII,Therefore the mighty sons of Achaea showed
9699,BOOK XIII,"Grace to him, as to a friend, and spared his life"
9700,BOOK XIII,"And substance, fearing Themis who seeth all."
9701,BOOK XIII,
9702,BOOK XIII,Then also princely Anchises' noble son--
9703,BOOK XIII,Hard had he fought through Priam's burg that night
9704,BOOK XIII,"With spear and valour, and many had he slain--"
9705,BOOK XIII,When now he saw the city set aflame
9706,BOOK XIII,"By hands of foes, saw her folk perishing"
9707,BOOK XIII,"In multitudes, her treasures spoiled, her wives"
9708,BOOK XIII,"And children dragged to thraldom from their homes,"
9709,BOOK XIII,No more he hoped to see the stately walls
9710,BOOK XIII,"Of his birth-city, but bethought him now"
9711,BOOK XIII,How from that mighty ruin to escape.
9712,BOOK XIII,"And as the helmsman of a ship, who toils"
9713,BOOK XIII,"On the deep sea, and matches all his craft"
9714,BOOK XIII,Against the winds and waves from every side
9715,BOOK XIII,"Rushing against him in the stormy time,"
9716,BOOK XIII,"Forspent at last, both hand and heart, when now"
9717,BOOK XIII,"The ship is foundering in the surge, forsakes"
9718,BOOK XIII,"The helm, to launch forth in a little boat,"
9719,BOOK XIII,And heeds no longer ship and lading; so
9720,BOOK XIII,Anchises' gallant son forsook the town
9721,BOOK XIII,"And left her to her foes, a sea of fire."
9722,BOOK XIII,His son and father alone he snatched from death;
9723,BOOK XIII,The old man broken down with years he set
9724,BOOK XIII,"On his broad shoulders with his own strong hands,"
9725,BOOK XIII,"And led the young child by his small soft hand,"
9726,BOOK XIII,Whose little footsteps lightly touched the ground;
9727,BOOK XIII,"And, as he quaked to see that work of deaths"
9728,BOOK XIII,"His father led him through the roar of fight,"
9729,BOOK XIII,"And clinging hung on him the tender child,"
9730,BOOK XIII,Tears down his soft cheeks streaming.  But the man
9731,BOOK XIII,"O'er many a body sprang with hurrying feet,"
9732,BOOK XIII,And in the darkness in his own despite
9733,BOOK XIII,"Trampled on many.  Cypris guided them,"
9734,BOOK XIII,"Earnest to save from that wild ruin her son,"
9735,BOOK XIII,"His father, and his child.  As on he pressed,"
9736,BOOK XIII,The flames gave back before him everywhere:
9737,BOOK XIII,The blast of the Fire-god's breath to right and left
9738,BOOK XIII,Was cloven asunder.  Spears and javelins hurled
9739,BOOK XIII,Against him by the Achaeans harmless fell.
9740,BOOK XIII,"Also, to stay them, Calchas cried aloud:"
9741,BOOK XIII,"""Forbear against Aeneas' noble head"
9742,BOOK XIII,"To hurl the bitter dart, the deadly spear!"
9743,BOOK XIII,Fated he is by the high Gods' decree
9744,BOOK XIII,"To pass from Xanthus, and by Tiber's flood"
9745,BOOK XIII,To found a city holy and glorious
9746,BOOK XIII,"Through all time, and to rule o'er tribes of men"
9747,BOOK XIII,Far-sundered.  Of his seed shall lords of earth
9748,BOOK XIII,Rule from the rising to the setting sun.
9749,BOOK XIII,"Yea, with the Immortals ever shall he dwell,"
9750,BOOK XIII,Who is son of Aphrodite lovely-tressed.
9751,BOOK XIII,From him too is it meet we hold our hands
9752,BOOK XIII,Because he hath preferred his father and son
9753,BOOK XIII,"To gold, to all things that might profit a man"
9754,BOOK XIII,Who fleeth exiled to an alien land.
9755,BOOK XIII,This one night hath revealed to us a man
9756,BOOK XIII,"Faithful to death to his father and his child."""
9757,BOOK XIII,
9758,BOOK XIII,"Then hearkened they, and as a God did all"
9759,BOOK XIII,Look on him.  Forth the city hasted he
9760,BOOK XIII,"Whither his feet should bear him, while the foe"
9761,BOOK XIII,Made havoc still of goodly-builded Troy.
9762,BOOK XIII,
9763,BOOK XIII,Then also Menelaus in Helen's bower
9764,BOOK XIII,"Found, heavy with wine, ill-starred Deiphobus,"
9765,BOOK XIII,And slew him with the sword: but she had fled
9766,BOOK XIII,And hidden her in the palace.  O'er the blood
9767,BOOK XIII,"Of that slain man exulted he, and cried:"
9768,BOOK XIII,"""Dog!  I, even I have dealt thee unwelcome death"
9769,BOOK XIII,This day!  No dawn divine shall meet thee again
9770,BOOK XIII,"Alive in Troy--ay, though thou vaunt thyself"
9771,BOOK XIII,Spouse of the child of Zeus the thunder-voiced!
9772,BOOK XIII,Black death hath trapped thee slain in my wife's bower!
9773,BOOK XIII,Would I had met Alexander too in fight
9774,BOOK XIII,"Ere this, and plucked his heart out!  So my grief"
9775,BOOK XIII,Had been a lighter load.  But he hath paid
9776,BOOK XIII,"Already justice' debt, hath passed beneath"
9777,BOOK XIII,"Death's cold dark shadow.  Ha, small joy to thee"
9778,BOOK XIII,"My wife was doomed to bring!  Ay, wicked men"
9779,BOOK XIII,Never elude pure Themis: night and day
9780,BOOK XIII,"Her eyes are on them, and the wide world through"
9781,BOOK XIII,"Above the tribes of men she floats in air,"
9782,BOOK XIII,"Holpen of Zeus, for punishment of sin."""
9783,BOOK XIII,
9784,BOOK XIII,"On passed he, dealing merciless death to foes,"
9785,BOOK XIII,For maddened was his soul with jealousy.
9786,BOOK XIII,Against the Trojans was his bold heart full
9787,BOOK XIII,"Of thoughts of vengeance, which were now fulfilled"
9788,BOOK XIII,"By the dread Goddess Justice, for that theirs"
9789,BOOK XIII,"Was that first outrage touching Helen, theirs"
9790,BOOK XIII,"That profanation of the oaths, and theirs"
9791,BOOK XIII,That trampling on the blood of sacrifice
9792,BOOK XIII,When their presumptuous souls forgat the Gods.
9793,BOOK XIII,Therefore the Vengeance-friends brought woes on them
9794,BOOK XIII,"Thereafter, and some died in fighting field,"
9795,BOOK XIII,Some now in Troy by board and bridal bower.
9796,BOOK XIII,
9797,BOOK XIII,Menelaus mid the inner chambers found
9798,BOOK XIII,"At last his wife, there cowering from the wrath"
9799,BOOK XIII,"Of her bold-hearted lord.  He glared on her,"
9800,BOOK XIII,Hungering to slay her in his jealous rage.
9801,BOOK XIII,"But winsome Aphrodite curbed him, struck"
9802,BOOK XIII,"Out of his hand the sword, his onrush reined,"
9803,BOOK XIII,"Jealousy's dark cloud swept she away, and stirred"
9804,BOOK XIII,Love's deep sweet well-springs in his heart and eyes.
9805,BOOK XIII,Swept o'er him strange amazement: powerless all
9806,BOOK XIII,"Was he to lift the sword against her neck,"
9807,BOOK XIII,Seeing her splendour of beauty.  Like a stock
9808,BOOK XIII,"Of dead wood in a mountain forest, which"
9809,BOOK XIII,"No swiftly-rushing blasts of north-winds shake,"
9810,BOOK XIII,"Nor fury of south-winds ever, so he stood,"
9811,BOOK XIII,So dazed abode long time.  All his great strength
9812,BOOK XIII,"Was broken, as he looked upon his wife."
9813,BOOK XIII,And suddenly had he forgotten all
9814,BOOK XIII,"Yea, all her sins against her spousal-troth;"
9815,BOOK XIII,"For Aphrodite made all fade away,"
9816,BOOK XIII,She who subdueth all immortal hearts
9817,BOOK XIII,And mortal.  Yet even so he lifted up
9818,BOOK XIII,"From earth his sword, and made as he would rush"
9819,BOOK XIII,"Upon his wife but other was his intent,"
9820,BOOK XIII,"Even as he sprang: he did but feign, to cheat"
9821,BOOK XIII,Achaean eyes.  Then did his brother stay
9822,BOOK XIII,"His fury, and spake with pacifying words,"
9823,BOOK XIII,Fearing lest all they had toiled for should be lost:
9824,BOOK XIII,"""Forbear wrath, Menelaus, now: 'twere shame"
9825,BOOK XIII,"To slay thy wedded wife, for whose sake we"
9826,BOOK XIII,"Have suffered much affliction, while we sought"
9827,BOOK XIII,"Vengeance on Priam.  Not, as thou dost deem,"
9828,BOOK XIII,"Was Helen's the sin, but his who set at naught"
9829,BOOK XIII,"The Guest-lord, and thine hospitable board;"
9830,BOOK XIII,"So with death-pangs hath God requited him."""
9831,BOOK XIII,
9832,BOOK XIII,Then hearkened Menelaus to his rede.
9833,BOOK XIII,"But the Gods, palled in dark clouds, mourned for Troy,"
9834,BOOK XIII,A ruined glory save fair-tressed Tritonis
9835,BOOK XIII,"And Hera: their hearts triumphed, when they saw"
9836,BOOK XIII,The burg of god-descended Priam destroyed.
9837,BOOK XIII,Yet not the wise heart Trito-born herself
9838,BOOK XIII,Was wholly tearless; for within her fane
9839,BOOK XIII,Outraged Cassandra was of Oileus son
9840,BOOK XIII,Lust-maddened.  But grim vengeance upon him
9841,BOOK XIII,"Ere long the Goddess wreaked, repaying insult"
9842,BOOK XIII,"With mortal sufferance.  Yea, she would not look"
9843,BOOK XIII,"Upon the infamy, but clad herself"
9844,BOOK XIII,With shame and wrath as with a cloak: she turned
9845,BOOK XIII,"Her stern eyes to the temple-roof, and groaned"
9846,BOOK XIII,"The holy image, and the hallowed floor"
9847,BOOK XIII,Quaked mightily.  Yet did he not forbear
9848,BOOK XIII,"His mad sin, for his soul was lust-distraught."
9849,BOOK XIII,
9850,BOOK XIII,"Here, there, on all sides crumbled flaming homes"
9851,BOOK XIII,In ruin down: scorched dust with smoke was blent:
9852,BOOK XIII,Trembled the streets to the awful thunderous crash.
9853,BOOK XIII,"Here burned Aeneas' palace, yonder flamed"
9854,BOOK XIII,Antimachus' halls: one furnace was the height
9855,BOOK XIII,Of fair-built Pergamus; flames were roaring round
9856,BOOK XIII,"Apollo's temple, round Athena's fane,"
9857,BOOK XIII,And round the Hearth-lord's altar: flames licked up
9858,BOOK XIII,Fair chambers of the sons' sons of a king;
9859,BOOK XIII,And all the city sank down into hell.
9860,BOOK XIII,
9861,BOOK XIII,"Of Trojans some by Argos' sons were slain,"
9862,BOOK XIII,"Some by their own roofs crashing down in fire,"
9863,BOOK XIII,Giving at once in death and tomb to them:
9864,BOOK XIII,"Some in their own throats plunged the steel, when foes"
9865,BOOK XIII,And fire were in the porch together seen:
9866,BOOK XIII,"Some slew their wives and children, and flung themselves"
9867,BOOK XIII,"Dead on them, when despair had done its work"
9868,BOOK XIII,"Of horror.  One, who deemed the foe afar,"
9869,BOOK XIII,"Caught up a vase, and, fain to quench the flame,"
9870,BOOK XIII,Hasted for water.  Leapt unmarked on him
9871,BOOK XIII,"An Argive, and his spirit, heavy with wine,"
9872,BOOK XIII,Was thrust forth from the body by the spear.
9873,BOOK XIII,"Clashed the void vase above him, as he fell"
9874,BOOK XIII,Backward within the house.  As through his hall
9875,BOOK XIII,"Another fled, the burning roof-beam crashed"
9876,BOOK XIII,"Down on his head, and swift death came with it."
9877,BOOK XIII,"And many women, as in frenzied flight"
9878,BOOK XIII,"They rushed forth, suddenly remembered babes"
9879,BOOK XIII,Left in their beds beneath those burning roofs:
9880,BOOK XIII,With wild feet sped they back--the house fell in
9881,BOOK XIII,"Upon them, and they perished, mother and child."
9882,BOOK XIII,Horses and dogs in panic through the town
9883,BOOK XIII,"Fled from the flames, trampling beneath their feet"
9884,BOOK XIII,"The dead, and dashing into living men"
9885,BOOK XIII,To their sore hurt.  Shrieks rang through all the town.
9886,BOOK XIII,In through his blazing porchway rushed a man
9887,BOOK XIII,To rescue wife and child.  Through smoke and flame
9888,BOOK XIII,"Blindly he groped, and perished while he cried"
9889,BOOK XIII,"Their names, and pitiless doom slew those within."
9890,BOOK XIII,
9891,BOOK XIII,"The fire-glow upward mounted to the sky,"
9892,BOOK XIII,"The red glare o'er the firmament spread its wings,"
9893,BOOK XIII,And all the tribes of folk that dwelt around
9894,BOOK XIII,"Beheld it, far as Ida's mountain-crests,"
9895,BOOK XIII,"And sea-girt Tenedos, and Thracian Samos."
9896,BOOK XIII,And men that voyaged on the deep sea cried:
9897,BOOK XIII,"""The Argives have achieved their mighty task"
9898,BOOK XIII,After long toil for star-eyed Helen's sake.
9899,BOOK XIII,"All Troy, the once queen-city, burns in fire:"
9900,BOOK XIII,"For all their prayers, no God defends them now;"
9901,BOOK XIII,"For strong Fate oversees all works of men,"
9902,BOOK XIII,And the renownless and obscure to fame
9903,BOOK XIII,"She raises, and brings low the exalted ones."
9904,BOOK XIII,"Oft out of good is evil brought, and good"
9905,BOOK XIII,"From evil, mid the travail and change of life."""
9906,BOOK XIII,
9907,BOOK XIII,"So spake they, who from far beheld the glare"
9908,BOOK XIII,Of Troy's great burning.  Compassed were her folk
9909,BOOK XIII,With wailing misery: through her streets the foe
9910,BOOK XIII,"Exulted, as when madding blasts turmoil"
9911,BOOK XIII,"The boundless sea, what time the Altar ascends"
9912,BOOK XIII,"To heaven's star-pavement, turned to the misty south"
9913,BOOK XIII,"Overagainst Arcturus tempest-breathed,"
9914,BOOK XIII,"And with its rising leap the wild winds forth,"
9915,BOOK XIII,And ships full many are whelmed 'neath ravening seas;
9916,BOOK XIII,Wild as those stormy winds Achaea's sons
9917,BOOK XIII,Ravaged steep Ilium while she burned in flame.
9918,BOOK XIII,As when a mountain clothed with shaggy woods
9919,BOOK XIII,"Burns swiftly in a fire-blast winged with winds,"
9920,BOOK XIII,"And from her tall peaks goeth up a roar,"
9921,BOOK XIII,And all the forest-children this way and that
9922,BOOK XIII,"Rush through the wood, tormented by the flame;"
9923,BOOK XIII,So were the Trojans perishing: there was none
9924,BOOK XIII,"To save, of all the Gods.  Round these were staked"
9925,BOOK XIII,"The nets of Fate, which no man can escape."
9926,BOOK XIII,
9927,BOOK XIII,Then were Demophoon and Acamas
9928,BOOK XIII,By mighty Theseus' mother Aethra met.
9929,BOOK XIII,Yearning to see them was she guided on
9930,BOOK XIII,"To meet them by some Blessed One, the while"
9931,BOOK XIII,'Wildered from war and fire she fled.  They saw
9932,BOOK XIII,"In that red glare a woman royal-tall,"
9933,BOOK XIII,"Imperial-moulded, and they weened that this"
9934,BOOK XIII,"Was Priam's queen, and with swift eagerness"
9935,BOOK XIII,"Laid hands on her, to lead her captive thence"
9936,BOOK XIII,To the Danaans; but piteously she moaned:
9937,BOOK XIII,"""Ah, do not, noble sons of warrior Greeks,"
9938,BOOK XIII,"To your ships hale me, as I were a foe!"
9939,BOOK XIII,I am not of Trojan birth: of Danaans came
9940,BOOK XIII,My princely blood renowned.  In Troezen's halls
9941,BOOK XIII,"Pittheus begat me, Aegeus wedded me,"
9942,BOOK XIII,And of my womb sprang Theseus glory-crowned.
9943,BOOK XIII,"For great Zeus' sake, for your dear parents' sake,"
9944,BOOK XIII,"I pray you, if the seed of Theseus came"
9945,BOOK XIII,"Hither with Atreus' sons, O bring ye me"
9946,BOOK XIII,Unto their yearning eyes.  I trow they be
9947,BOOK XIII,Young men like you.  My soul shall be refreshed
9948,BOOK XIII,"If living I behold those chieftains twain."""
9949,BOOK XIII,
9950,BOOK XIII,"Hearkening to her they called their sire to mind,"
9951,BOOK XIII,"His deeds for Helen's sake, and how the sons"
9952,BOOK XIII,Of Zeus the Thunderer in the old time smote
9953,BOOK XIII,"Aphidnae, when, because these were but babes,"
9954,BOOK XIII,Their nurses hid them far from peril of fight;
9955,BOOK XIII,And Aethra they remembered--all she endured
9956,BOOK XIII,"Through wars, as mother-in-law at first, and thrall"
9957,BOOK XIII,"Thereafter of Helen.  Dumb for joy were they,"
9958,BOOK XIII,Till spake Demophoon to that wistful one:
9959,BOOK XIII,"""Even now the Gods fulfil thine heart's desire:"
9960,BOOK XIII,"We whom thou seest are the sons of him,"
9961,BOOK XIII,Thy noble son: thee shall our loving hands
9962,BOOK XIII,Bear to the ships: with joy to Hellas' soil
9963,BOOK XIII,"Thee will we bring, where once thou wast a queen."""
9964,BOOK XIII,
9965,BOOK XIII,Then his great father's mother clasped him round
9966,BOOK XIII,"With clinging arms: she kissed his shoulders broad,"
9967,BOOK XIII,"His head, his breast, his bearded lips she kissed,"
9968,BOOK XIII,"And Acamas kissed withal, the while she shed"
9969,BOOK XIII,Glad tears on these who could not choose but weep.
9970,BOOK XIII,"As when one tarries long mid alien men,"
9971,BOOK XIII,"And folk report him dead, but suddenly"
9972,BOOK XIII,"He cometh home: his children see his face,"
9973,BOOK XIII,"And break into glad weeping; yea, and he,"
9974,BOOK XIII,"His arms around them, and their little heads"
9975,BOOK XIII,"Upon his shoulders, sobs: echoes the home"
9976,BOOK XIII,With happy mourning's music-beating wings;
9977,BOOK XIII,So wept they with sweet sighs and sorrowless moans.
9978,BOOK XIII,
9979,BOOK XIII,"Then, too, affliction-burdened Priam's child,"
9980,BOOK XIII,"Laodice, say they, stretched her hands to heaven,"
9981,BOOK XIII,Praying the mighty Gods that earth might gape
9982,BOOK XIII,"To swallow her, ere she defiled her hand"
9983,BOOK XIII,"With thralls' work; and a God gave ear, and rent"
9984,BOOK XIII,Deep earth beneath her: so by Heaven's decree
9985,BOOK XIII,Did earth's abysmal chasm receive the maid
9986,BOOK XIII,"In Troy's last hour.  Electra's self withal,"
9987,BOOK XIII,"The Star-queen lovely-robed, shrouded her form"
9988,BOOK XIII,"In mist and cloud, and left the Pleiad-band,"
9989,BOOK XIII,"Her sisters, as the olden legend tells."
9990,BOOK XIII,Still riseth up in sight of toil-worn men
9991,BOOK XIII,Their bright troop in the skies; but she alone
9992,BOOK XIII,"Hides viewless ever, since the hallowed town"
9993,BOOK XIII,"Of her son Dardanus in ruin fell,"
9994,BOOK XIII,"When Zeus most high from heaven could help her not,"
9995,BOOK XIII,Because to Fate the might of Zeus must bow;
9996,BOOK XIII,And by the Immortals' purpose all these things
9997,BOOK XIII,"Had come to pass, or by Fate's ordinance."
9998,BOOK XIII,
9999,BOOK XIII,"Still on Troy's folk the Argives wreaked their wrath,"
10000,BOOK XIII,And battle's issues Strife Incarnate held.
10001,BOOK XIII,
10002,BOOK XIII,
10003,BOOK XIII,
10004,BOOK XIV.,BOOK XIV.
10005,BOOK XIV.,
10006,BOOK XIV.,How the conquerors sailed from Troy unto judgment of tempest and
10007,BOOK XIV.,shipwreck.
10008,BOOK XIV.,
10009,BOOK XIV.,
10010,BOOK XIV.,Then rose from Ocean Dawn the golden-throned
10011,BOOK XIV.,Up to the heavens; night into Chaos sank.
10012,BOOK XIV.,"And now the Argives spoiled fair-fenced Troy,"
10013,BOOK XIV.,And took her boundless treasures for a prey.
10014,BOOK XIV.,"Like river-torrents seemed they, that sweep down,"
10015,BOOK XIV.,"By rain, floods swelled, in thunder from the hills,"
10016,BOOK XIV.,And seaward hurl tall trees and whatsoe'er
10017,BOOK XIV.,"Grows on the mountains, mingled with the wreck"
10018,BOOK XIV.,Of shattered cliff and crag; so the long lines
10019,BOOK XIV.,Of Danaans who had wasted Troy with fire
10020,BOOK XIV.,"Seemed, streaming with her plunder to the ships."
10021,BOOK XIV.,Troy's daughters therewithal in scattered bands
10022,BOOK XIV.,"They haled down seaward--virgins yet unwed,"
10023,BOOK XIV.,"And new-made brides, and matrons silver-haired,"
10024,BOOK XIV.,And mothers from whose bosoms foes had torn
10025,BOOK XIV.,Babes for the last time closing lips on breasts.
10026,BOOK XIV.,
10027,BOOK XIV.,Amidst of these Menelaus led his wife
10028,BOOK XIV.,"Forth of the burning city, having wrought"
10029,BOOK XIV.,A mighty triumph--joy and shame were his.
10030,BOOK XIV.,Cassandra heavenly-fair was haled the prize
10031,BOOK XIV.,Of Agamemnon: to Achilles' son
10032,BOOK XIV.,Andromache had fallen: Hecuba
10033,BOOK XIV.,Odysseus dragged unto his ship.  The tears
10034,BOOK XIV.,Poured from her eyes as water from a spring;
10035,BOOK XIV.,"Trembled her limbs, fear-frenzied was her heart;"
10036,BOOK XIV.,Rent were her hoary tresses and besprent
10037,BOOK XIV.,"With ashes of the hearth, cast by her hands"
10038,BOOK XIV.,When she saw Priam slain and Troy aflame.
10039,BOOK XIV.,And aye she deeply groaned for thraldom's day
10040,BOOK XIV.,That trapped her vainly loth.  Each hero led
10041,BOOK XIV.,A wailing Trojan woman to his ship.
10042,BOOK XIV.,"Here, there, uprose from these the wild lament,"
10043,BOOK XIV.,The woeful-mingling cries of mother and babe.
10044,BOOK XIV.,As when with white-tusked swine the herdmen drive
10045,BOOK XIV.,Their younglings from the hill-pens to the plain
10046,BOOK XIV.,"As winter closeth in, and evermore"
10047,BOOK XIV.,Each answereth each with mingled plaintive cries;
10048,BOOK XIV.,"So moaned Troy's daughters by their foes enslaved,"
10049,BOOK XIV.,Handmaid and queen made one in thraldom's lot.
10050,BOOK XIV.,
10051,BOOK XIV.,But Helen raised no lamentation: shame
10052,BOOK XIV.,"Sat on her dark-blue eyes, and cast its flush"
10053,BOOK XIV.,Over her lovely cheeks.  Her heart beat hard
10054,BOOK XIV.,"With sore misgiving, lest, as to the ships"
10055,BOOK XIV.,"She passed, the Achaeans might mishandle her."
10056,BOOK XIV.,Therefore with fluttering soul she trembled sore;
10057,BOOK XIV.,"And, her head darkly mantled in her veil,"
10058,BOOK XIV.,"Close-following trod she in her husband's steps,"
10059,BOOK XIV.,"With cheek shame-crimsoned, like the Queen of Love,"
10060,BOOK XIV.,What time the Heaven-abiders saw her clasped
10061,BOOK XIV.,"In Ares' arms, shaming in sight of all"
10062,BOOK XIV.,"The marriage-bed, trapped in the myriad-meshed"
10063,BOOK XIV.,Toils of Hephaestus: tangled there she lay
10064,BOOK XIV.,"In agony of shame, while thronged around"
10065,BOOK XIV.,"The Blessed, and there stood Hephaestus' self:"
10066,BOOK XIV.,For fearful it is for wives to be beheld
10067,BOOK XIV.,By husbands' eyes doing the deed of shame.
10068,BOOK XIV.,Lovely as she in form and roseate blush
10069,BOOK XIV.,Passed Helen mid the Trojan captives on
10070,BOOK XIV.,To the Argive ships.  But the folk all around
10071,BOOK XIV.,Marvelled to see the glory of loveliness
10072,BOOK XIV.,Of that all-flawless woman.  No man dared
10073,BOOK XIV.,Or secretly or openly to cast
10074,BOOK XIV.,Reproach on her.  As on a Goddess all
10075,BOOK XIV.,Gazed on her with adoring wistful eyes.
10076,BOOK XIV.,"As when to wanderers on a stormy sea,"
10077,BOOK XIV.,"After long time and passion of prayer, the sight"
10078,BOOK XIV.,Of fatherland is given; from deadly deeps
10079,BOOK XIV.,"Escaped, they stretch hands to her joyful-souled;"
10080,BOOK XIV.,"So joyed the Danaans all, no man of them"
10081,BOOK XIV.,Remembered any more war's travail and pain.
10082,BOOK XIV.,"Such thoughts Cytherea stirred in them, for grace"
10083,BOOK XIV.,"To Helen starry-eyed, and Zeus her sire."
10084,BOOK XIV.,
10085,BOOK XIV.,"Then, when he saw that burg beloved destroyed,"
10086,BOOK XIV.,"Xanthus, scarce drawing breath from bloody war,"
10087,BOOK XIV.,"Mourned with his Nymphs for ruin fallen on Troy,"
10088,BOOK XIV.,Mourned for the city of Priam blotted out.
10089,BOOK XIV.,"As when hail lashes a field of ripened wheat,"
10090,BOOK XIV.,"And beats it small, and smites off all the ears"
10091,BOOK XIV.,"With merciless scourge, and levelled with the ground"
10092,BOOK XIV.,"Are stalks, and on the earth is all the grain"
10093,BOOK XIV.,"Woefully wasted, and the harvest's lord"
10094,BOOK XIV.,Is stricken with deadly grief; so Xanthus' soul
10095,BOOK XIV.,Was utterly whelmed in grief for Ilium made
10096,BOOK XIV.,"A desolation; grief undying was his,"
10097,BOOK XIV.,Immortal though he was.  Mourned Simois
10098,BOOK XIV.,And long-ridged Ida: all who on Ida dwelt
10099,BOOK XIV.,Wailed from afar the ruin of Priam's town.
10100,BOOK XIV.,
10101,BOOK XIV.,But with loud laughter of glee the Argives sought
10102,BOOK XIV.,"Their galleys, chanting the triumphant might"
10103,BOOK XIV.,"Of victory, chanting now the Blessed Gods,"
10104,BOOK XIV.,"Now their own valour, and Epeius' work"
10105,BOOK XIV.,"Ever renowned.  Their song soared up to heaven,"
10106,BOOK XIV.,"Like multitudinous cries of daws, when breaks"
10107,BOOK XIV.,A day of sunny calm and windless air
10108,BOOK XIV.,After a ruining storm: from their glad hearts
10109,BOOK XIV.,"So rose the joyful clamour, till the Gods"
10110,BOOK XIV.,"Heard and rejoiced in heaven, all who had helped"
10111,BOOK XIV.,With willing hands the war-fain Argive men.
10112,BOOK XIV.,"But chafed those others which had aided Troy,"
10113,BOOK XIV.,"Beholding Priam's city wrapped in flame,"
10114,BOOK XIV.,Yet powerless for her help to override
10115,BOOK XIV.,Fate; for not Cronos' Son can stay the hand
10116,BOOK XIV.,"Of Destiny, whose might transcendeth all"
10117,BOOK XIV.,"The Immortals, and Zeus sanctioneth all her deeds."
10118,BOOK XIV.,
10119,BOOK XIV.,The Argives on the flaming altar-wood
10120,BOOK XIV.,"Laid many thighs of oxen, and made haste"
10121,BOOK XIV.,"To spill sweet wine on their burnt offerings,"
10122,BOOK XIV.,Thanking the Gods for that great work achieved.
10123,BOOK XIV.,And loudly at the feast they sang the praise
10124,BOOK XIV.,Of all the mailed men whom the Horse of Tree
10125,BOOK XIV.,Had ambushed.  Far-famed Sinon they extolled
10126,BOOK XIV.,For that dire torment he endured of foes;
10127,BOOK XIV.,"Yea, song and honour-guerdons without end"
10128,BOOK XIV.,All rendered him: and that resolved soul
10129,BOOK XIV.,"Glad-hearted joyed for the Argives victory,"
10130,BOOK XIV.,And for his own misfeaturing sorrowed not.
10131,BOOK XIV.,For to the wise and prudent man renown
10132,BOOK XIV.,"Is better far than gold, than goodlihead,"
10133,BOOK XIV.,Than all good things men have or hope to win.
10134,BOOK XIV.,
10135,BOOK XIV.,"So, feasting by the ships all void of fear,"
10136,BOOK XIV.,Cried one to another ever and anon:
10137,BOOK XIV.,"""We have touched the goal of this long war, have won"
10138,BOOK XIV.,"Glory, have smitten our foes and their great town!"
10139,BOOK XIV.,"Now grant, O Zeus, to our prayers safe home-return!"""
10140,BOOK XIV.,But not to all the Sire vouchsafed return.
10141,BOOK XIV.,
10142,BOOK XIV.,Then rose a cunning harper in their midst.
10143,BOOK XIV.,And sang the song of triumph and of peace
10144,BOOK XIV.,"Re-won, and with glad hearts untouched by care"
10145,BOOK XIV.,"They heard; for no more fear of war had they,"
10146,BOOK XIV.,But of sweet toil of law-abiding days
10147,BOOK XIV.,"And blissful, fleeting hours henceforth they dreamed."
10148,BOOK XIV.,All the War's Story in their eager ears
10149,BOOK XIV.,He sang--how leagued peoples gathering met
10150,BOOK XIV.,At hallowed Aulis--how the invincible strength
10151,BOOK XIV.,Of Peleus' son smote fenced cities twelve
10152,BOOK XIV.,"In sea-raids, how he marched o'er leagues on leagues"
10153,BOOK XIV.,"Of land, and spoiled eleven--all he wrought"
10154,BOOK XIV.,In fight with Telephus and Eetion--
10155,BOOK XIV.,How he slew giant Cycnus--all the toil
10156,BOOK XIV.,Of war that through Achilles' wrath befell
10157,BOOK XIV.,The Achaeans--how he dragged dead Hector round
10158,BOOK XIV.,"His own Troy's wall, and how he slew in fight"
10159,BOOK XIV.,Penthesileia and Tithonus' son:--
10160,BOOK XIV.,"How Aias laid low Glaucus, lord of spears,"
10161,BOOK XIV.,Then sang he how the child of Aeacus' son
10162,BOOK XIV.,"Struck down Eurypylus, and how the shafts"
10163,BOOK XIV.,Of Philoctetes dealt to Paris death.
10164,BOOK XIV.,Then the song named all heroes who passed in
10165,BOOK XIV.,"To ambush in the Horse of Guile, and hymned"
10166,BOOK XIV.,The fall of god-descended Priam's burg;
10167,BOOK XIV.,"The feast he sang last, and peace after war;"
10168,BOOK XIV.,"Then many another, as they listed, sang."
10169,BOOK XIV.,
10170,BOOK XIV.,But when above those feasters midnight's stars
10171,BOOK XIV.,"Hung, ceased the Danaans from the feast and wine,"
10172,BOOK XIV.,"And turned to sleep's forgetfulness of care,"
10173,BOOK XIV.,For that with yesterday's war-travail all
10174,BOOK XIV.,"Were wearied; wherefore they, who fain all night"
10175,BOOK XIV.,"Had revelled, needs must cease: how loth soe'er,"
10176,BOOK XIV.,"Sleep drew them thence; here, there, soft slumbered they."
10177,BOOK XIV.,
10178,BOOK XIV.,But in his tent Menelaus lovingly
10179,BOOK XIV.,With bright-haired Helen spake; for on their eyes
10180,BOOK XIV.,Sleep had not fallen yet.  The Cyprian Queen
10181,BOOK XIV.,"Brooded above their souls, that olden love"
10182,BOOK XIV.,"Might be renewed, and heart-ache chased away."
10183,BOOK XIV.,
10184,BOOK XIV.,"Helen first brake the silence, and she said:"
10185,BOOK XIV.,"""O Menelaus, be not wroth with me!"
10186,BOOK XIV.,"Not of my will I left thy roof, thy bed,"
10187,BOOK XIV.,But Alexander and the sons of Troy
10188,BOOK XIV.,"Came upon me, and snatched away, when thou"
10189,BOOK XIV.,Wast far thence.  Oftentimes did I essay
10190,BOOK XIV.,"By the death-noose to perish wretchedly,"
10191,BOOK XIV.,Or by the bitter sword; but still they stayed
10192,BOOK XIV.,"Mine hand, and still spake comfortable words"
10193,BOOK XIV.,To salve my grief for thee and my sweet child.
10194,BOOK XIV.,"For her sake, for the sake of olden love,"
10195,BOOK XIV.,"And for thine own sake, I beseech thee now,"
10196,BOOK XIV.,"Forget thy stern displeasure against thy wife."""
10197,BOOK XIV.,
10198,BOOK XIV.,Answered her Menelaus wise of wit:
10199,BOOK XIV.,"""No more remember past griefs: seal them up"
10200,BOOK XIV.,Hid in thine heart.  Let all be locked within
10201,BOOK XIV.,The dim dark mansion of forgetfulness.
10202,BOOK XIV.,"What profits it to call ill deeds to mind?"""
10203,BOOK XIV.,
10204,BOOK XIV.,"Glad was she then: fear flitted from her heart,"
10205,BOOK XIV.,And came sweet hope that her lord's wrath was dead.
10206,BOOK XIV.,"She cast her arms around him, and their eyes"
10207,BOOK XIV.,With tears were brimming as they made sweet moan;
10208,BOOK XIV.,"And side by side they laid them, and their hearts"
10209,BOOK XIV.,Thrilled with remembrance of old spousal joy.
10210,BOOK XIV.,And as a vine and ivy entwine their stems
10211,BOOK XIV.,"Each around other, that no might of wind"
10212,BOOK XIV.,"Avails to sever them, so clung these twain"
10213,BOOK XIV.,Twined in the passionate embrace of love.
10214,BOOK XIV.,
10215,BOOK XIV.,"When came on these too sorrow-drowning sleep,"
10216,BOOK XIV.,Even then above his son's head rose and stood
10217,BOOK XIV.,"Godlike Achilles' mighty shade, in form"
10218,BOOK XIV.,"As when he lived, the Trojans' bane, the joy"
10219,BOOK XIV.,"Of Greeks, and kissed his neck and flashing eyes"
10220,BOOK XIV.,"Lovingly, and spake comfortable words:"
10221,BOOK XIV.,"""All hail, my son!  Vex not thine heart with grief"
10222,BOOK XIV.,For thy dead sire; for with the Blessed Gods
10223,BOOK XIV.,Now at the feast I sit.  Refrain thy soul
10224,BOOK XIV.,"From sorrow, and plant my strength within thy mind."
10225,BOOK XIV.,Be foremost of the Argives ever; yield
10226,BOOK XIV.,"To none in valour, but in council bow"
10227,BOOK XIV.,Before thine elders: so shall all acclaim
10228,BOOK XIV.,Thy courtesy.  Honour princely men and wise;
10229,BOOK XIV.,"For the true man is still the true man's friend,"
10230,BOOK XIV.,Even as the vile man cleaveth to the knave.
10231,BOOK XIV.,"If good thy thought be, good shall be thy deeds:"
10232,BOOK XIV.,"But no man shall attain to Honour's height,"
10233,BOOK XIV.,Except his heart be right within: her stem
10234,BOOK XIV.,"Is hard to climb, and high in heaven spread"
10235,BOOK XIV.,Her branches: only they whom strength and toil
10236,BOOK XIV.,"Attend, strain up to pluck her blissful fruit,"
10237,BOOK XIV.,Climbing the Tree of Honour glow-crowned.
10238,BOOK XIV.,"Thou therefore follow fame, and let thy soul"
10239,BOOK XIV.,"Be not in sorrow afflicted overmuch,"
10240,BOOK XIV.,"Nor in prosperity over-glad.  To friends,"
10241,BOOK XIV.,"To comrades, child and wife, be kindly of heart,"
10242,BOOK XIV.,Remembering still that near to all men stand
10243,BOOK XIV.,"The gates of doom, the mansions of the dead:"
10244,BOOK XIV.,"For humankind are like the flower of grass,"
10245,BOOK XIV.,The blossom of spring; these fade the while those bloom:
10246,BOOK XIV.,Therefore be ever kindly with thy kind.
10247,BOOK XIV.,Now to the Argives say--to Atreus' son
10248,BOOK XIV.,Agamemnon chiefly--if my battle-toil
10249,BOOK XIV.,"Round Priam's walls, and those sea-raids I led"
10250,BOOK XIV.,"Or ever I set foot on Trojan land,"
10251,BOOK XIV.,"Be in their hearts remembered, to my tomb"
10252,BOOK XIV.,Be Priam's daughter Polyxeina led--
10253,BOOK XIV.,Whom as my portion of the spoil I claim--
10254,BOOK XIV.,And sacrificed thereon: else shall my wrath
10255,BOOK XIV.,Against them more than for Briseis burn.
10256,BOOK XIV.,The waves of the great deep will I turmoil
10257,BOOK XIV.,"To bar their way, upstirring storm on storm,"
10258,BOOK XIV.,That through their own mad folly pining away
10259,BOOK XIV.,"Here they may linger long, until to me"
10260,BOOK XIV.,"They pour drink-offerings, yearning sore for home."
10261,BOOK XIV.,"But, when they have slain the maiden, I grudge not"
10262,BOOK XIV.,"That whoso will may bury her far from me."""
10263,BOOK XIV.,
10264,BOOK XIV.,"Then as a wind-breath swift he fleeted thence,"
10265,BOOK XIV.,"And came to the Elysian Plain, whereto"
10266,BOOK XIV.,"A path to heaven reacheth, for the feet"
10267,BOOK XIV.,Ascending and descending of the Blest.
10268,BOOK XIV.,"Then the son started up from sleep, and called"
10269,BOOK XIV.,"His sire to mind, and glowed the heart in him."
10270,BOOK XIV.,
10271,BOOK XIV.,"When to wide heaven the Child of Mist uprose,"
10272,BOOK XIV.,"Scattering night, unveiling earth and air,"
10273,BOOK XIV.,Then from their rest upsprang Achaea's sons
10274,BOOK XIV.,Yearning for home.  With laughter 'gan they hale
10275,BOOK XIV.,"Down to the sea the keels: but lo, their haste"
10276,BOOK XIV.,Was reined in by Achilles' mighty son:
10277,BOOK XIV.,
10278,BOOK XIV.,"He assembled them, and told his sire's behest:"
10279,BOOK XIV.,"""Hearken, dear sons of Argives battle-staunch,"
10280,BOOK XIV.,"To this my glorious father's hest, to me"
10281,BOOK XIV.,Spoken in darkness slumbering on my bed:
10282,BOOK XIV.,"He saith, he dwells with the Immortal Gods:"
10283,BOOK XIV.,He biddeth you and Atreus' son the king
10284,BOOK XIV.,"To bring, as his war-guerdon passing-fair,"
10285,BOOK XIV.,"To his dim dark tomb Polyxeina queenly-robed,"
10286,BOOK XIV.,"To slay her there, but far thence bury her."
10287,BOOK XIV.,"But if ye slight him, and essay to sail"
10288,BOOK XIV.,"The sea, he threateneth to stir up the waves"
10289,BOOK XIV.,"To bar your path upon the deep, and here"
10290,BOOK XIV.,"Storm-bound long time to hold you, ships and men."""
10291,BOOK XIV.,
10292,BOOK XIV.,"Then hearkened they, and as to a God they prayed;"
10293,BOOK XIV.,For even now a storm-blast on the sea
10294,BOOK XIV.,"Upheaved the waves, broad-backed and thronging fast"
10295,BOOK XIV.,More than before beneath the madding wind.
10296,BOOK XIV.,"Tossed the great deep, smit by Poseidon's hands"
10297,BOOK XIV.,For a grace to strong Achilles.  All the winds
10298,BOOK XIV.,Swooped on the waters.  Prayed the Dardans all
10299,BOOK XIV.,"To Achilles, and a man to his fellow cried:"
10300,BOOK XIV.,"""Great Zeus's seed Achilles verily was;"
10301,BOOK XIV.,"Therefore is he a God, who in days past"
10302,BOOK XIV.,Dwelt among us; for lapse of dateless time
10303,BOOK XIV.,"Makes not the sons of Heaven to fade away."""
10304,BOOK XIV.,
10305,BOOK XIV.,"Then to Achilles' tomb the host returned,"
10306,BOOK XIV.,"And led the maid, as calf by herdmen dragged"
10307,BOOK XIV.,"For sacrifice, from woodland pastures torn"
10308,BOOK XIV.,"From its mother's side, and lowing long and loud"
10309,BOOK XIV.,It moans with anguished heart; so Priam's child
10310,BOOK XIV.,Wailed in the hands of foes.  Down streamed her tears
10311,BOOK XIV.,As when beneath the heavy sacks of sand
10312,BOOK XIV.,"Olives clear-skinned, ne'er blotched by drops of storm,"
10313,BOOK XIV.,"Pour out their oil, when the long levers creak"
10314,BOOK XIV.,As strong men strain the cords; so poured the tears
10315,BOOK XIV.,"Of travail-burdened Priam's daughter, haled"
10316,BOOK XIV.,"To stern Achilles' tomb, tears blent with moans."
10317,BOOK XIV.,"Drenched were her bosom-folds, glistened the drops"
10318,BOOK XIV.,On flesh clear-white as costly ivory.
10319,BOOK XIV.,
10320,BOOK XIV.,"Then, to crown all her griefs, yet sharper pain"
10321,BOOK XIV.,Fell on the heart of hapless Hecuba.
10322,BOOK XIV.,"Then did her soul recall that awful dream,"
10323,BOOK XIV.,The vision of sleep of that night overpast:
10324,BOOK XIV.,Herseemed that on Achilles' tomb she stood
10325,BOOK XIV.,"Moaning, her hair down-streaming to the ground,"
10326,BOOK XIV.,"And from her breasts blood dripped to earth the while,"
10327,BOOK XIV.,"And drenched the tomb.  Fear-haunted touching this,"
10328,BOOK XIV.,"Foreboding all calamity, she wailed"
10329,BOOK XIV.,Piteously; far rang her wild lament.
10330,BOOK XIV.,"As a dog moaning at her master's door,"
10331,BOOK XIV.,"Utters long howls, her teats with milk distent,"
10332,BOOK XIV.,"Whose whelps, ere their eyes opened to the light,"
10333,BOOK XIV.,"Her lords afar have flung, a prey to kites;"
10334,BOOK XIV.,"And now with short sharp cries she plains, and now"
10335,BOOK XIV.,Long howling: the weird outcry thrills the air;
10336,BOOK XIV.,So wailed and shrieked for her child Hecuba:
10337,BOOK XIV.,"""Ah me! what sorrows first or last shall I"
10338,BOOK XIV.,"Lament heart-anguished, who am full of woes?"
10339,BOOK XIV.,"Those unimagined ills my sons, my king"
10340,BOOK XIV.,"Have suffered?  or my city, or daughters shamed?"
10341,BOOK XIV.,"Or my despair, my day of slavery?"
10342,BOOK XIV.,"Oh, the grim fates have caught me in a net"
10343,BOOK XIV.,"Of manifold ills!  O child, they have spun for thee"
10344,BOOK XIV.,Dread weird of unimagined misery!
10345,BOOK XIV.,"They have thrust thee away, when near was Hymen's hymn,"
10346,BOOK XIV.,"From thine espousals, marked thee for destruction"
10347,BOOK XIV.,"Dark, unendurable, unspeakable!"
10348,BOOK XIV.,"For lo, a dead man's heart, Achilles' heart,"
10349,BOOK XIV.,Is by our blood made warm with life to-day!
10350,BOOK XIV.,"O child, dear child, that I might die with thee,"
10351,BOOK XIV.,"That earth might swallow me, ere I see thy doom!"""
10352,BOOK XIV.,"So cried she, weeping never-ceasing tears,"
10353,BOOK XIV.,For grief on bitter grief encompassed her.
10354,BOOK XIV.,"But when these reached divine Achilles' tomb,"
10355,BOOK XIV.,"Then did his son unsheathe the whetted sword,"
10356,BOOK XIV.,"His left hand grasped the maid, and his right hand"
10357,BOOK XIV.,"Was laid upon the tomb, and thus he cried:"
10358,BOOK XIV.,"""Hear, father, thy son's prayer, hear all the prayers"
10359,BOOK XIV.,"Of Argives, and be no more wroth with us!"
10360,BOOK XIV.,"Lo, unto thee now all thine heart's desire"
10361,BOOK XIV.,"Will we fulfil.  Be gracious to us thou,"
10362,BOOK XIV.,"And to our praying grant sweet home-return."""
10363,BOOK XIV.,
10364,BOOK XIV.,Into the maid's throat then he plunged the blade
10365,BOOK XIV.,"Of death: the dear life straightway sobbed she forth,"
10366,BOOK XIV.,With the last piteous moan of parting breath.
10367,BOOK XIV.,Face-downward to the earth she fell: all round
10368,BOOK XIV.,"Her flesh was crimsoned from her neck, as snow"
10369,BOOK XIV.,Stained on a mountain-side with scarlet blood
10370,BOOK XIV.,"Rushing, from javelin-smitten boar or bear."
10371,BOOK XIV.,"The maiden's corpse then gave they, to be borne"
10372,BOOK XIV.,"Unto the city, to Antenor's home,"
10373,BOOK XIV.,"For that, when Troy yet stood, he nurtured her"
10374,BOOK XIV.,"In his fair halls, a bride for his own son"
10375,BOOK XIV.,"Eurymachus.  The old man buried her,"
10376,BOOK XIV.,"King Priam's princess-child, nigh his own house,"
10377,BOOK XIV.,"By Ganymedes' shrine, and overagainst"
10378,BOOK XIV.,The temple of Pallas the Unwearied One.
10379,BOOK XIV.,"Then were the waves stilled, and the blast was hushed"
10380,BOOK XIV.,"To sleep, and all the sea-flood lulled to calm."
10381,BOOK XIV.,
10382,BOOK XIV.,"Swift with glad laughter hied they to the ships,"
10383,BOOK XIV.,Hymning Achilles and the Blessed Ones.
10384,BOOK XIV.,"A feast they made, first severing thighs of kine"
10385,BOOK XIV.,For the Immortals.  Gladsome sacrifice
10386,BOOK XIV.,Steamed on all sides: in cups of silver and gold
10387,BOOK XIV.,They drank sweet wine: their hearts leaped up with hope
10388,BOOK XIV.,Of winning to their fatherland again.
10389,BOOK XIV.,"But when with meats and wine all these were filled,"
10390,BOOK XIV.,Then in their eager ears spake Neleus' son:
10391,BOOK XIV.,"""Hear, friends, who have 'scaped the long turmoil of war,"
10392,BOOK XIV.,That I may say to you one welcome word:
10393,BOOK XIV.,"Now is the hour of heart's delight, the hour"
10394,BOOK XIV.,Of home-return.  Away!  Achilles soul
10395,BOOK XIV.,Hath ceased from ruinous wrath; Earth-shaker stills
10396,BOOK XIV.,"The stormy wave, and gentle breezes blow;"
10397,BOOK XIV.,"No more the waves toss high.  Haste, hale the ships"
10398,BOOK XIV.,"Down to the sea.  Now, ho for home-return!"""
10399,BOOK XIV.,
10400,BOOK XIV.,"Eager they heard, and ready made the ships."
10401,BOOK XIV.,Then was a marvellous portent seen of men;
10402,BOOK XIV.,For all-unhappy Priam's queen was changed
10403,BOOK XIV.,From woman's form into a pitiful hound;
10404,BOOK XIV.,And all men gathered round in wondering awe.
10405,BOOK XIV.,Then all her body a God transformed to stone--
10406,BOOK XIV.,A mighty marvel for men yet unborn!
10407,BOOK XIV.,At Calchas' bidding this the Achaeans bore
10408,BOOK XIV.,In a swift ship to Hellespont's far side.
10409,BOOK XIV.,Then down to the sea in haste they ran the keels:
10410,BOOK XIV.,"Their wealth they laid aboard, even all the spoil"
10411,BOOK XIV.,"Taken, or ever unto Troy they came,"
10412,BOOK XIV.,From conquered neighbour peoples; therewithal
10413,BOOK XIV.,"Whatso they took from Ilium, wherein most"
10414,BOOK XIV.,"They joyed, for untold was the sum thereof."
10415,BOOK XIV.,And followed with them many a captive maid
10416,BOOK XIV.,With anguished heart: so went they aboard the ships.
10417,BOOK XIV.,But Calchas would not with that eager host
10418,BOOK XIV.,"Launch forth; yea, he had fain withheld therefrom"
10419,BOOK XIV.,"All the Achaeans, for his prophet-soul"
10420,BOOK XIV.,Foreboded dread destruction looming o'er
10421,BOOK XIV.,The Argives by the Rocks Capherean.
10422,BOOK XIV.,But naught they heeded him; malignant
10423,BOOK XIV.,Fate Deluded men's souls: only Amphilochus
10424,BOOK XIV.,"The wise in prophet-lore, the gallant son"
10425,BOOK XIV.,"Of princely Amphiaraus, stayed with him."
10426,BOOK XIV.,"Fated were these twain, far from their own land,"
10427,BOOK XIV.,To reach Pamphylian and Cilician burgs;
10428,BOOK XIV.,And this the Gods thereafter brought to pass.
10429,BOOK XIV.,
10430,BOOK XIV.,But now the Achaeans cast the hawsers loose
10431,BOOK XIV.,From shore: in haste they heaved the anchor-stones.
10432,BOOK XIV.,Roared Hellespont beneath swift-flashing oars;
10433,BOOK XIV.,Crashed the prows through the sea.  About the bows
10434,BOOK XIV.,Much armour of slain foes was lying heaped:
10435,BOOK XIV.,Along the bulwarks victory-trophies hung
10436,BOOK XIV.,"Countless.  With garlands wreathed they all the ships,"
10437,BOOK XIV.,"Their heads, the spears, the shields wherewith they had fought"
10438,BOOK XIV.,"Against their foes.  The chiefs stood on the prows,"
10439,BOOK XIV.,And poured into the dark sea once and again
10440,BOOK XIV.,"Wine to the Gods, to grant them safe return."
10441,BOOK XIV.,But with the winds their prayers mixed; far away
10442,BOOK XIV.,Vainly they floated blent with cloud and air.
10443,BOOK XIV.,
10444,BOOK XIV.,With anguished hearts the captive maids looked back
10445,BOOK XIV.,"On Ilium, and with sobs and moans they wailed,"
10446,BOOK XIV.,Striving to hide their grief from Argive eyes.
10447,BOOK XIV.,Clasping their knees some sat; in misery some
10448,BOOK XIV.,Veiled with their hands their faces; others nursed
10449,BOOK XIV.,Young children in their arms: those innocents
10450,BOOK XIV.,"Not yet bewailed their day of bondage, nor"
10451,BOOK XIV.,Their country's ruin; all their thoughts were set
10452,BOOK XIV.,"On comfort of the breast, for the babe's heart"
10453,BOOK XIV.,Hath none affinity with sorrow.  All
10454,BOOK XIV.,Sat with unbraided hair and pitiful breasts
10455,BOOK XIV.,Scored with their fingers.  On their cheeks there lay
10456,BOOK XIV.,"Stains of dried tears, and streamed thereover now"
10457,BOOK XIV.,"Fresh tears full fast, as still they gazed aback"
10458,BOOK XIV.,"On the lost hapless home, wherefrom yet rose"
10459,BOOK XIV.,"The flames, and o'er it writhed the rolling smoke."
10460,BOOK XIV.,"Now on Cassandra marvelling they gazed,"
10461,BOOK XIV.,Calling to mind her prophecy of doom;
10462,BOOK XIV.,"But at their tears she laughed in bitter scorn,"
10463,BOOK XIV.,In anguish for the ruin of her land.
10464,BOOK XIV.,
10465,BOOK XIV.,Such Trojans as had scaped from pitiless war
10466,BOOK XIV.,Gathered to render now the burial-dues
10467,BOOK XIV.,Unto their city's slain.  Antenor led
10468,BOOK XIV.,To that sad work: one pyre for all they raised.
10469,BOOK XIV.,
10470,BOOK XIV.,"But laughed with triumphing hearts the Argive men,"
10471,BOOK XIV.,"As now with oars they swept o'er dark sea-ways,"
10472,BOOK XIV.,"Now hastily hoised the sails high o'er the ships,"
10473,BOOK XIV.,"And fleeted fast astern Dardania-land,"
10474,BOOK XIV.,"And Hero Achilles' tomb.  But now their hearts,"
10475,BOOK XIV.,"How blithe soe'er, remembered comrades slain,"
10476,BOOK XIV.,"And sorely grieved, and wistfully they looked"
10477,BOOK XIV.,Back to the alien's land; it seemed to them
10478,BOOK XIV.,Aye sliding farther from their ships.  Full soon
10479,BOOK XIV.,By Tenedos' beaches slipt they: now they ran
10480,BOOK XIV.,"By Chrysa, Sminthian Phoebus' holy place,"
10481,BOOK XIV.,And hallowed Cilla.  Far away were glimpsed
10482,BOOK XIV.,The windy heights of Lesbos.  Rounded now
10483,BOOK XIV.,"Was Lecton's foreland, where is the last peak"
10484,BOOK XIV.,"Of Ida.  In the sails loud hummed the wind,"
10485,BOOK XIV.,Crashed round the prows the dark surge: the long waves
10486,BOOK XIV.,"Showed shadowy hollows, far the white wake gleamed."
10487,BOOK XIV.,
10488,BOOK XIV.,Now had the Argives all to the hallowed soil
10489,BOOK XIV.,"Of Hellas won, by perils of the deep"
10490,BOOK XIV.,"Unscathed, but for Athena Daughter of Zeus"
10491,BOOK XIV.,"The Thunderer, and her indignation's wrath."
10492,BOOK XIV.,"When nigh Euboea's windy heights they drew,"
10493,BOOK XIV.,"She rose, in anger unappeasable"
10494,BOOK XIV.,"Against the Locrian king, devising doom"
10495,BOOK XIV.,"Crushing and pitiless, and drew nigh to Zeus"
10496,BOOK XIV.,"Lord of the Gods, and spake to him apart"
10497,BOOK XIV.,In wrath that in her breast would not be pent:
10498,BOOK XIV.,"""Zeus, Father, unendurable of Gods"
10499,BOOK XIV.,"Is men's presumption!  They reck not of thee,"
10500,BOOK XIV.,"Of none of the Blessed reck they, forasmuch"
10501,BOOK XIV.,As vengeance followeth after sin no more;
10502,BOOK XIV.,And ofttimes more afflicted are good men
10503,BOOK XIV.,"Than evil, and their misery hath no end."
10504,BOOK XIV.,Therefore no man regardeth justice: shame
10505,BOOK XIV.,"Lives not with men!  And I, I will not dwell"
10506,BOOK XIV.,"Hereafter in Olympus, not be named"
10507,BOOK XIV.,"Thy daughter, if I may not be avenged"
10508,BOOK XIV.,"On the Achaeans' reckless sin!  Behold,"
10509,BOOK XIV.,Within my very temple Oileus' son
10510,BOOK XIV.,"Hath wrought iniquity, hath pitied not"
10511,BOOK XIV.,Cassandra stretching unregarded hands
10512,BOOK XIV.,Once and again to me; nor did he dread
10513,BOOK XIV.,"My might, nor reverenced in his wicked heart"
10514,BOOK XIV.,"The Immortal, but a deed intolerable"
10515,BOOK XIV.,He did.  Therefore let not thy spirit divine
10516,BOOK XIV.,"Begrudge mine heart's desire, that so all men"
10517,BOOK XIV.,"May quake before the manifest wrath of Gods."""
10518,BOOK XIV.,
10519,BOOK XIV.,Answered the Sire with heart-assuaging words:
10520,BOOK XIV.,"""Child, not for the Argives' sake withstand I thee;"
10521,BOOK XIV.,But all mine armoury which the Cyclops' might
10522,BOOK XIV.,"To win my favour wrought with tireless hands,"
10523,BOOK XIV.,"To thy desire I give.  O strong heart, hurl"
10524,BOOK XIV.,"A ruining storm thyself on the Argive fleet."""
10525,BOOK XIV.,
10526,BOOK XIV.,Then down before the aweless Maid he cast
10527,BOOK XIV.,"Swift lightning, thunder, and deadly thunderbolt;"
10528,BOOK XIV.,"And her heart leapt, and gladdened was her soul."
10529,BOOK XIV.,"She donned the stormy Aegis flashing far,"
10530,BOOK XIV.,"Adamantine, massy, a marvel to the Gods,"
10531,BOOK XIV.,"Whereon was wrought Medusa's ghastly head,"
10532,BOOK XIV.,Fearful: strong serpents breathing forth the blast
10533,BOOK XIV.,Of ravening fire were on the face thereof.
10534,BOOK XIV.,"Crashed on the Queen's breast all the Aegis-links,"
10535,BOOK XIV.,As after lightning crashes the firmament.
10536,BOOK XIV.,"Then grasped she her father's weapons, which no God"
10537,BOOK XIV.,"Save Zeus can lift, and wide Olympus shook."
10538,BOOK XIV.,Then swept she clouds and mist together on high;
10539,BOOK XIV.,"Night over earth was poured, haze o'er the sea."
10540,BOOK XIV.,"Zeus watched, and was right glad as broad heaven's floor"
10541,BOOK XIV.,"Rocked 'neath the Goddess's feet, and crashed the sky,"
10542,BOOK XIV.,As though invincible Zeus rushed forth to war.
10543,BOOK XIV.,"Then sped she Iris unto Acolus,"
10544,BOOK XIV.,"From heaven far-flying over misty seas,"
10545,BOOK XIV.,To bid him send forth all his buffering winds
10546,BOOK XIV.,O'er iron-bound Caphereus' cliffs to sweep
10547,BOOK XIV.,"Ceaselessly, and with ruin of madding blasts"
10548,BOOK XIV.,"To upheave the sea.  And Iris heard, and swift"
10549,BOOK XIV.,"She darted, through cloud-billows plunging down--"
10550,BOOK XIV.,"Thou hadst said: ""Lo, in the sky dark water and fire!"""
10551,BOOK XIV.,"And to Aeolia came she, isle of caves,"
10552,BOOK XIV.,Of echoing dungeons of mad-raging winds
10553,BOOK XIV.,"With rugged ribs of mountain overarched,"
10554,BOOK XIV.,Whereby the mansion stands of Aeolus
10555,BOOK XIV.,Hippotas' son.  Him found she therewithin
10556,BOOK XIV.,With wife and twelve sons; and she told to him
10557,BOOK XIV.,Athena's purpose toward the homeward-bound
10558,BOOK XIV.,"Achaeans.  He denied her not, but passed"
10559,BOOK XIV.,"Forth of his halls, and in resistless hands"
10560,BOOK XIV.,"Upswung his trident, smiting the mountain-side"
10561,BOOK XIV.,Within whose chasm-cell the wild winds dwelt
10562,BOOK XIV.,Tempestuously shrieking.  Ever pealed
10563,BOOK XIV.,Weird roarings of their voices round its vaults.
10564,BOOK XIV.,Cleft by his might was the hill-side; forth they poured.
10565,BOOK XIV.,He bade them on their wings bear blackest storm
10566,BOOK XIV.,"To upheave the sea, and shroud Caphereus' heights."
10567,BOOK XIV.,"Swiftly upsprang they, ere their king's command"
10568,BOOK XIV.,Was fully spoken.  Mightily moaned the sea
10569,BOOK XIV.,As they rushed o'er it; waves like mountain-cliffs
10570,BOOK XIV.,From all sides were uprolled.  The Achaeans' hearts
10571,BOOK XIV.,"Were terror-palsied, as the uptowering surge"
10572,BOOK XIV.,"Now swung the ships up high through palling mist,"
10573,BOOK XIV.,Now hurled them rolled as down a precipice
10574,BOOK XIV.,To dark abysses.  Up through yawning deeps
10575,BOOK XIV.,Some power resistless belched the boiling sand
10576,BOOK XIV.,"From the sea's floor.  Tossed in despair, fear-dazed,"
10577,BOOK XIV.,"Men could not grasp the oar, nor reef the sail"
10578,BOOK XIV.,"About the yard-arm, howsoever fain,"
10579,BOOK XIV.,"Ere the winds rent it, could not with the sheets"
10580,BOOK XIV.,"Trim the torn canvas, buffeted so were they"
10581,BOOK XIV.,By ruining blasts.  The helmsman had no power
10582,BOOK XIV.,"To guide the rudder with his practised hands,"
10583,BOOK XIV.,For those ill winds hurled all confusedly.
10584,BOOK XIV.,"No hope of life was left them: blackest night,"
10585,BOOK XIV.,"Fury of tempest, wrath of deathless Gods,"
10586,BOOK XIV.,Raged round them.  Still Poseidon heaved and swung
10587,BOOK XIV.,"The merciless sea, to work the heart's desire"
10588,BOOK XIV.,Of his brother's glorious child; and she on high
10589,BOOK XIV.,"Stormed with her lightnings, ruthless in her rage."
10590,BOOK XIV.,"Thundered from heaven Zeus, in purpose fixed"
10591,BOOK XIV.,To glorify his daughter.  All the isles
10592,BOOK XIV.,And mainlands round were lashed by leaping seas
10593,BOOK XIV.,"Nigh to Euboea, where the Power divine"
10594,BOOK XIV.,Scourged most with unrelenting stroke on stroke
10595,BOOK XIV.,The Argives.  Groan and shriek of perishing men
10596,BOOK XIV.,Rang through the ships; started great beams and snapped
10597,BOOK XIV.,"With ominous sound, for ever ship on ship"
10598,BOOK XIV.,With shivering timbers crashed.  With hopeless toil
10599,BOOK XIV.,Men strained with oars to thrust back hulls that reeled
10600,BOOK XIV.,"Down on their own, but with the shattered planks"
10601,BOOK XIV.,"Were hurled into the abyss, to perish there"
10602,BOOK XIV.,By pitiless doom; for beams of foundering ships
10603,BOOK XIV.,"From this, from that side battered out their lives,"
10604,BOOK XIV.,And crushed were all their bodies wretchedly.
10605,BOOK XIV.,"Some in the ships fell down, and like dead men"
10606,BOOK XIV.,"Lay there; some, in the grip of destiny,"
10607,BOOK XIV.,"Clinging to oars smooth-shaven, tried to swim;"
10608,BOOK XIV.,Some upon planks were tossing.  Roared the surge
10609,BOOK XIV.,"From fathomless depths: it seemed as though sea, sky,"
10610,BOOK XIV.,And land were blended all confusedly.
10611,BOOK XIV.,
10612,BOOK XIV.,Still from Olympus thundering Atrytone
10613,BOOK XIV.,"Wielded her Father's power unshamed, and still"
10614,BOOK XIV.,The welkin shrieked around.  Her ruin of wrath
10615,BOOK XIV.,Now upon Aias hurled she: on his ship
10616,BOOK XIV.,"Dashed she a thunderbolt, and shivered it"
10617,BOOK XIV.,"Wide in a moment into fragments small,"
10618,BOOK XIV.,"While earth and air yelled o'er the wreck, and whirled"
10619,BOOK XIV.,And plunged and fell the whole sea down thereon.
10620,BOOK XIV.,They in the ship were all together flung
10621,BOOK XIV.,"Forth: all about them swept the giant waves,"
10622,BOOK XIV.,Round them leapt lightnings flaming through the dark.
10623,BOOK XIV.,"Choked with the strangling surf of hissing brine,"
10624,BOOK XIV.,"Gasping out life, they drifted o'er the sea."
10625,BOOK XIV.,
10626,BOOK XIV.,"But even in death those captive maids rejoiced,"
10627,BOOK XIV.,"As some ill-starred ones, clasping to their breasts"
10628,BOOK XIV.,"Their babes, sank in the sea; some flung their arms"
10629,BOOK XIV.,"Round Danaans' horror-stricken heads, and dragged"
10630,BOOK XIV.,"These down with them, so rendering to their foes"
10631,BOOK XIV.,Requital for foul outrage down to them.
10632,BOOK XIV.,And from on high the haughty Trito-born
10633,BOOK XIV.,"Looked down on all this, and her heart was glad."
10634,BOOK XIV.,
10635,BOOK XIV.,"But Aias floated now on a galley's plank,"
10636,BOOK XIV.,"Now through the brine with strong hands oared his path,"
10637,BOOK XIV.,Like some old Titan in his tireless might.
10638,BOOK XIV.,Cleft was the salt sea-surge by the sinewy hands
10639,BOOK XIV.,Of that undaunted man: the Gods beheld
10640,BOOK XIV.,And marvelled at his courage and his strength.
10641,BOOK XIV.,But now the billows swung him up on high
10642,BOOK XIV.,"Through misty air, as though to a mountain's peak,"
10643,BOOK XIV.,"Now whelmed him down, as they would bury him"
10644,BOOK XIV.,In ravening whirlpits: yet his stubborn hands
10645,BOOK XIV.,Toiled on unwearied.  Aye to right and left
10646,BOOK XIV.,"Flashed lightnings down, and quenched them in the sea;"
10647,BOOK XIV.,For not yet was the Child of Thunderer Zeus
10648,BOOK XIV.,"Purposed to smite him dead, despite her wrath,"
10649,BOOK XIV.,Ere he had drained the cup of travail and pain
10650,BOOK XIV.,Down to the dregs; so in the deep long time
10651,BOOK XIV.,"Affliction wore him down, tormented sore"
10652,BOOK XIV.,On every side.  Grim Fates stood round the man
10653,BOOK XIV.,Unnumbered; yet despair still kindled strength.
10654,BOOK XIV.,"He cried: ""Though all the Olympians banded come"
10655,BOOK XIV.,"In wrath, and rouse against me all the sea,"
10656,BOOK XIV.,"I will escape them!""  But no whit did he"
10657,BOOK XIV.,Elude the Gods' wrath; for the Shaker of Earth
10658,BOOK XIV.,In fierceness of his indignation marked
10659,BOOK XIV.,"Where his hands clung to the Gyraean Rock,"
10660,BOOK XIV.,And in stern anger with an earthquake shook
10661,BOOK XIV.,Both sea and land.  Around on all sides crashed
10662,BOOK XIV.,Caphereus' cliffs: beneath the Sea-king's wrath
10663,BOOK XIV.,The surf-tormented beaches shrieked and roared.
10664,BOOK XIV.,"The broad crag rifted reeled into the sea,"
10665,BOOK XIV.,The rock whereto his desperate hands had clung;
10666,BOOK XIV.,"Yet did he writhe up round its jutting spurs,"
10667,BOOK XIV.,"While flayed his hands were, and from 'neath his nails"
10668,BOOK XIV.,"The blood ran.  Wrestling with him roared the waves,"
10669,BOOK XIV.,And the foam whitened all his hair and beard.
10670,BOOK XIV.,
10671,BOOK XIV.,"Yet had he 'scaped perchance his evil doom,"
10672,BOOK XIV.,"Had not Poseidon, wroth with his hardihood,"
10673,BOOK XIV.,"Cleaving the earth, hurled down the chasm the rock,"
10674,BOOK XIV.,As in the old time Pallas heaved on high
10675,BOOK XIV.,"Sicily, and on huge Enceladus"
10676,BOOK XIV.,"Dashed down the isle, which burns with the burning yet"
10677,BOOK XIV.,"Of that immortal giant, as he breathes"
10678,BOOK XIV.,"Fire underground; so did the mountain-crag,"
10679,BOOK XIV.,"Hurled from on high, bury the Locrian king,"
10680,BOOK XIV.,"Pinning the strong man down, a wretch crushed flat."
10681,BOOK XIV.,And so on him death's black destruction came
10682,BOOK XIV.,Whom land and sea alike were leagued to slay.
10683,BOOK XIV.,
10684,BOOK XIV.,Still over the great deep were swept the rest
10685,BOOK XIV.,"Of those Achaeans, crouching terror-dazed"
10686,BOOK XIV.,"Down in the ships, save those that mid the waves"
10687,BOOK XIV.,Had fallen.  Misery encompassed all;
10688,BOOK XIV.,"For some with heavily-plunging prows drave on,"
10689,BOOK XIV.,With keels upturned some drifted.  Here were masts
10690,BOOK XIV.,"Snapped from the hull by rushing gusts, and there"
10691,BOOK XIV.,Were tempest-rifted wrecks of scattered beams;
10692,BOOK XIV.,"And some had sunk, whelmed in the mighty deep,"
10693,BOOK XIV.,Swamped by the torrent downpour from the clouds:
10694,BOOK XIV.,For these endured not madness of wind-tossed sea
10695,BOOK XIV.,Leagued with heaven's waterspout; for streamed the sky
10696,BOOK XIV.,"Ceaselessly like a river, while the deep"
10697,BOOK XIV.,"Raved round them.  And one cried: ""Such floods on men"
10698,BOOK XIV.,"Fell only when Deucalion's deluge came,"
10699,BOOK XIV.,"When earth was drowned, and all was fathomless sea!"""
10700,BOOK XIV.,
10701,BOOK XIV.,"So cried a Danaan, seeing soul-appalled"
10702,BOOK XIV.,That wild storm.  Thousands perished; corpses thronged
10703,BOOK XIV.,The great sea-highways: all the beaches were
10704,BOOK XIV.,Too strait for them: the surf belched multitudes
10705,BOOK XIV.,Forth on the land.  The heavy-booming sea
10706,BOOK XIV.,"With weltering beams of ships was wholly paved,"
10707,BOOK XIV.,And here and there the grey waves gleamed between.
10708,BOOK XIV.,
10709,BOOK XIV.,"So found they each his several evil fate,"
10710,BOOK XIV.,"Some whelmed beneath broad-rushing billows, some"
10711,BOOK XIV.,Wretchedly perishing with their shattered ships
10712,BOOK XIV.,By Nauplius' devising on the rocks.
10713,BOOK XIV.,"Wroth for that son whom they had done to death,"
10714,BOOK XIV.,"He; when the storm rose and the Argives died,"
10715,BOOK XIV.,"Rejoiced amid his sorrow, seeing a God"
10716,BOOK XIV.,"Gave to his hands revenge, which now he wreaked"
10717,BOOK XIV.,"Upon the host he hated, as o'er the deep"
10718,BOOK XIV.,They tossed sore-harassed.  To his sea-god sire
10719,BOOK XIV.,"He prayed that all might perish, ships and men"
10720,BOOK XIV.,"Whelmed in the deep.  Poseidon heard his prayer,"
10721,BOOK XIV.,And on the dark surge swept them nigh his land.
10722,BOOK XIV.,"He, like a harbour-warder, lifted high"
10723,BOOK XIV.,"A blazing torch, and so by guile he trapped"
10724,BOOK XIV.,"The Achaean men, who deemed that they had won"
10725,BOOK XIV.,A sheltering haven: but sharp reefs and crags
10726,BOOK XIV.,"Gave awful welcome unto ships and men,"
10727,BOOK XIV.,"Who, dashed to pieces on the cruel rocks"
10728,BOOK XIV.,"In the black night, crowned ills with direr ills."
10729,BOOK XIV.,"Some few escaped, by a God or Power unseen"
10730,BOOK XIV.,Plucked from death's hand.  Athena now rejoiced
10731,BOOK XIV.,"Her heart within, and now was racked with fears"
10732,BOOK XIV.,For prudent-souled Odysseus; for his weird
10733,BOOK XIV.,Was through Poseidon's wrath to suffer woes
10734,BOOK XIV.,Full many.
10735,BOOK XIV.,
10736,BOOK XIV.,But Earth-shaker's jealousy now
10737,BOOK XIV.,Burned against those long walls and towers uppiled
10738,BOOK XIV.,By the strong Argives for a fence against
10739,BOOK XIV.,The Trojans' battle-onset.  Swiftly then
10740,BOOK XIV.,He swelled to overbrimming all the sea
10741,BOOK XIV.,"That rolls from Euxine down to Hellespont,"
10742,BOOK XIV.,"And hurled it on the shore of Troy: and Zeus,"
10743,BOOK XIV.,"For a grace unto the glorious Shaker of Earth,"
10744,BOOK XIV.,Poured rain from heaven: withal Far-darter bare
10745,BOOK XIV.,In that great work his part; from Ida's heights
10746,BOOK XIV.,"Into one channel led he all her streams,"
10747,BOOK XIV.,And flooded the Achaeans' work.  The sea
10748,BOOK XIV.,"Dashed o'er it, and the roaring torrents still"
10749,BOOK XIV.,"Rushed on it, swollen by the rains of Zeus;"
10750,BOOK XIV.,And the dark surge of the wide-moaning sea
10751,BOOK XIV.,"Still hurled them back from mingling with the deep,"
10752,BOOK XIV.,Till all the Danaan walls were blotted out
10753,BOOK XIV.,Beneath their desolating flood.  Then earth
10754,BOOK XIV.,Was by Poseidon chasm-cleft: up rushed
10755,BOOK XIV.,"Deluge of water, slime and sand, while quaked"
10756,BOOK XIV.,"Sigeum with the mighty shock, and roared"
10757,BOOK XIV.,The beach and the foundations of the land
10758,BOOK XIV.,"Dardanian.  So vanished, whelmed from sight,"
10759,BOOK XIV.,"That mighty rampart.  Earth asunder yawned,"
10760,BOOK XIV.,"And all sank down, and only sand was seen,"
10761,BOOK XIV.,"When back the sea rolled, o'er the beach outspread"
10762,BOOK XIV.,Far down the heavy-booming shore.  All this
10763,BOOK XIV.,The Immortals' anger wrought.  But in their ships
10764,BOOK XIV.,The Argives storm-dispersed went sailing on.
10765,BOOK XIV.,"So came they home, as heaven guided each,"
10766,BOOK XIV.,Even all that 'scaped the fell sea-tempest blasts.
