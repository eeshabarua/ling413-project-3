58,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
59,INTRODUCTION.,
60,INTRODUCTION.,
61,INTRODUCTION.,
62,INTRODUCTION.,It is many years since I first entertained a vague idea of
63,INTRODUCTION.,"translating the _Orlando Furioso_, and circumstances of little"
64,INTRODUCTION.,"importance to the reader, led me more recently to undertake it in"
65,INTRODUCTION.,earnest. This work was again laid down; and afterwards resumed at
66,INTRODUCTION.,"the instance of a distinguished friend; and by an odd coincidence,"
67,INTRODUCTION.,I am indebted also to the suggestion of another eminent person for
68,INTRODUCTION.,"the idea of the present translation of the _Orlando Innamorato_,"
69,INTRODUCTION.,"which, I should observe, is intended to be auxiliary to that, my"
70,INTRODUCTION.,"first and greater undertaking, though I need scarcely say, that"
71,INTRODUCTION.,the story of Boiardo is a necessary prologue to the poem of
72,INTRODUCTION.,Ariosto.
73,INTRODUCTION.,
74,INTRODUCTION.,"It was my intention to have translated the first mentioned work,"
75,INTRODUCTION.,exactly upon the model adopted by Tressan in his version of the
76,INTRODUCTION.,"French romances, a scheme afterwards executed with so much better"
77,INTRODUCTION.,"success, by my late excellent friend, Mr. George Ellis, in his"
78,INTRODUCTION.,English work of the same description. A further consideration of
79,INTRODUCTION.,"the subject, however, induced me to imitate them only in their"
80,INTRODUCTION.,general plan of illustrating a compendious prose translation by
81,INTRODUCTION.,"extracts, without seeking to add poignancy to this, by what might"
82,INTRODUCTION.,give a false idea of the tone of my original. I recollected that I
83,INTRODUCTION.,stood in a very different predicament from that of either of these
84,INTRODUCTION.,"authors; that, to compare my work with the one, which is most"
85,INTRODUCTION.,"likely to be familiar to my readers, the 'Specimens of early"
86,INTRODUCTION.,"English Romances,' the originals are composed in a spirit of"
87,INTRODUCTION.,gravity which can hardly be confused with the gay style of the
88,INTRODUCTION.,"translator, and therefore nobody can be misled by the vein of"
89,INTRODUCTION.,"pleasantry which runs through Mr. Ellis's work, and which is sure"
90,INTRODUCTION.,to be exclusively ascribed to the author of the _Rifacimento_.
91,INTRODUCTION.,"This, however, would possibly not be the case with me, as the"
92,INTRODUCTION.,"_Innamorato_ is in a great measure a humourous work, of which I"
93,INTRODUCTION.,"might give a false impression, by infusing into it a different"
94,INTRODUCTION.,"species of wit, from that which distinguishes it;—a"
95,INTRODUCTION.,consideration which induced me to adopt the scheme I have pursued
96,INTRODUCTION.,in the following sheets.
97,INTRODUCTION.,
98,INTRODUCTION.,This project is to give a mere ground-plan of the Gothic edifice
99,INTRODUCTION.,"of Boiardo, upon a small scale, accompanied with some elevations"
100,INTRODUCTION.,and sections of the chambers; which I have sought to colour after
101,INTRODUCTION.,"my original: or, (to speak more plainly,) the reader is to look"
102,INTRODUCTION.,"for the mere story in my prose abridgement, while he may form some"
103,INTRODUCTION.,"notion of its tone and style, from the stanzas with which it is"
104,INTRODUCTION.,interspersed.
105,INTRODUCTION.,
106,INTRODUCTION.,"The _story_ indeed, which seems most likely to interest the"
107,INTRODUCTION.,"English reader, is that which took a strong possession of the"
108,INTRODUCTION.,"imagination of Milton, who refers with more apparent enthusiasm to"
109,INTRODUCTION.,"the _Innamorato_, than to the _Furioso_, and whose apparent"
110,INTRODUCTION.,"preference is justifiable, if a richer stream of invention, and"
111,INTRODUCTION.,"more consummate art in its distribution, are legitimate titles to"
112,INTRODUCTION.,admiration.
113,INTRODUCTION.,
114,INTRODUCTION.,"In this latter qualification more especially, Boiardo, however"
115,INTRODUCTION.,"inferior as a poet, must be considered as a superior artist to"
116,INTRODUCTION.,"Ariosto; and weaving as complicated a web as his successor, it is"
117,INTRODUCTION.,curious to observe how much he excels him as a story-teller. The
118,INTRODUCTION.,"tales, indeed, of Ariosto, (and the want of connexion among these"
119,INTRODUCTION.,"is, in my eyes, his most essential defect) are so many loose"
120,INTRODUCTION.,"episodes, which may be compared to parallel streams, flowing"
121,INTRODUCTION.,"towards one reservoir, but through separate and independent"
122,INTRODUCTION.,"channels. Those of Boiardo, on the contrary, are like waters,"
123,INTRODUCTION.,"that, however they may diverge, preserve their relation to the"
124,INTRODUCTION.,"parent river, to which their accession always seems necessary, and"
125,INTRODUCTION.,"with which they reunite, previous to its discharging its contents"
126,INTRODUCTION.,into their common resting-place. A short example may serve to
127,INTRODUCTION.,illustrate what I have laid down. A damsel in the _Innamorato_
128,INTRODUCTION.,relates to Rinaldo the adventures of two worthies named Iroldo and
129,INTRODUCTION.,"Prasildo, a narration which is interrupted, and which, though good"
130,INTRODUCTION.,"in itself, at first appears to be an insulated episode. Rinaldo,"
131,INTRODUCTION.,"however, afterwards falls in with Iroldo and his friend; and this"
132,INTRODUCTION.,"history, thus resumed, unites itself naturally with that of the"
133,INTRODUCTION.,paladin. It is thus that all the stories are dove-tailed one into
134,INTRODUCTION.,"the other, and form a mosaic, as striking from the nice union of"
135,INTRODUCTION.,"its parts, as from the brilliancy of its colours."
136,INTRODUCTION.,
137,INTRODUCTION.,"Boiardo's art, though here indeed he cannot be said to excel"
138,INTRODUCTION.,"Ariosto, is as conspicuous also in the direction of the strange"
139,INTRODUCTION.,"under-current of allegory which pervades his poem, as it is in the"
140,INTRODUCTION.,distribution of his stream of story; while the sort of esoteric
141,INTRODUCTION.,"doctrines conveyed by it, gives a mysterious interest even to what"
142,INTRODUCTION.,we imperfectly comprehend.
143,INTRODUCTION.,
144,INTRODUCTION.,"Such indeed is the case with many of the fables of the Odyssey,"
145,INTRODUCTION.,"and even of the Iliad; where the allegory, moreover, is always"
146,INTRODUCTION.,"subservient to poetry, and poetry is never made subservient to"
147,INTRODUCTION.,"allegory. This remarkable piece of judgment in the Greek poet has,"
148,INTRODUCTION.,"I think, been well imitated both by Boiardo and Ariosto, and it is"
149,INTRODUCTION.,the neglect of this principle which has made allegory so often
150,INTRODUCTION.,offensive in the _Faery Queene_ of Spenser. The obtrusive nature
151,INTRODUCTION.,"of this has been well compared by Mr. George Ellis, in his"
152,INTRODUCTION.,"Specimens of the early English poets, to a ghost in day-light. It"
153,INTRODUCTION.,"is, moreover, destructive to all character; for Spenser's heroes"
154,INTRODUCTION.,"being mere abstract personifications of some virtue or vice, we"
155,INTRODUCTION.,"almost always know what they are to do, though their actions are"
156,INTRODUCTION.,"often unnatural, if considered as the actions of human beings."
157,INTRODUCTION.,Hence it is that we are never entertained with pictures of manners
158,INTRODUCTION.,"in the _Faery Queen_, while these form one of the great charms of"
159,INTRODUCTION.,the poems with which I am contrasting it.
160,INTRODUCTION.,
161,INTRODUCTION.,"It may however be said with justice, that we are to ascribe this"
162,INTRODUCTION.,"more picturesque effect of allegory, rather to the spirit of the"
163,INTRODUCTION.,age than to that of the fabulist. For it is perhaps true that all
164,INTRODUCTION.,early fable is purely allegorical; that this is by degrees mixed
165,INTRODUCTION.,"up with other circumstances, and it is in this mixed character"
166,INTRODUCTION.,that it is most conducive to poetical effect. But in a later age
167,INTRODUCTION.,"and later process of refinement, when there is a greater tendency"
168,INTRODUCTION.,"to abstract, allegory is stript of her adventitious ornaments, and"
169,INTRODUCTION.,"is at last forced upon us in poetry, painting, and sculpture,"
170,INTRODUCTION.,"unveiled, or unencompassed by that sort of pleasing halo which is"
171,INTRODUCTION.,necessary to give her effect.
172,INTRODUCTION.,
173,INTRODUCTION.,But whether we are to ascribe Boiardo's success in this particular
174,INTRODUCTION.,"to the character of his age, or to his own superior judgment,"
175,INTRODUCTION.,"there is, I think, no doubt about the fact, and there is, I think,"
176,INTRODUCTION.,"as little difficulty in conceding to my author, upon other"
177,INTRODUCTION.,"grounds, the praise of skill in executing the singular work of"
178,INTRODUCTION.,which he was the architect.
179,INTRODUCTION.,
180,INTRODUCTION.,"This extraordinary man was Matteo Maria Boiardo, count of"
181,INTRODUCTION.,"Scandiano, and a native of Reggio in the Modenese, who flourished"
182,INTRODUCTION.,in the beginning of the sixteenth century. These are circumstances
183,INTRODUCTION.,"the more worthy of mention, as some of them tend to explain what"
184,INTRODUCTION.,may seem most strange in the composition of the _Innamorato_; such
185,INTRODUCTION.,"as the provincial character of the diction, and more especially"
186,INTRODUCTION.,that careless and almost contemptuous tone between jest and
187,INTRODUCTION.,"earnest, which distinguishes his poem. It is doubtless on this"
188,INTRODUCTION.,"account that Ugo Foscolo observes, in an ingenious critique on the"
189,INTRODUCTION.,"Italian romantic poets, in the _Quarterly Review_*, that he tells"
190,INTRODUCTION.,his story in the tone of a feudal baron; thus applying to him more
191,INTRODUCTION.,"justly what M. de Balzac has objected to another; of whom he says,"
192,INTRODUCTION.,"""qu'il s'est comporté dans son poëme comme un prince dans ses"
193,INTRODUCTION.,états. C'est en vertu de cette souverainté qu'il ne reconnoit
194,INTRODUCTION.,"point les lois, et qu'il se met au dessus du droit commun."""
195,INTRODUCTION.,
196,INTRODUCTION.,* In an article purporting to be a review of _Whistlecraft's
197,INTRODUCTION.,"poem_, (now entitled _The Monks and Giants_,) and _The Court and"
198,INTRODUCTION.,Parliament of Beasts_.
199,INTRODUCTION.,
200,INTRODUCTION.,"After speaking of the mode in which he arranged his work, it is a"
201,INTRODUCTION.,natural transition to the substance with which Boiardo built. This
202,INTRODUCTION.,"shews strong internal evidence* of having been taken, in the main,"
203,INTRODUCTION.,"from the old French romances of Charlemagne, or rather from"
204,INTRODUCTION.,"Italian works, raised upon their foundation. Hoole mentions one of"
205,INTRODUCTION.,"these, called _Aspramonte_, &c., of uncertain date, and we have"
206,INTRODUCTION.,"the titles of two others, which were anterior to the _Innamorato_,"
207,INTRODUCTION.,"one called _Li fatti di Carlo Magno e dei Paladini di Francia_,"
208,INTRODUCTION.,"printed in 1481; the other printed in 1491, and entitled _La"
209,INTRODUCTION.,"Historia real di Francia, che tratta dei fatti dei Paladini e di"
210,INTRODUCTION.,Carlo Magno in set libri_. Some indeed would seem to deny that
211,INTRODUCTION.,"Boiardo had dug in these mines, and would wish us to believe, that"
212,INTRODUCTION.,he not only compounded but manufactured the materials with which
213,INTRODUCTION.,he wrought. Such at least would appear to have been the drift of
214,INTRODUCTION.,"one, who observes that Agramant, Sacripant and Gradassso were"
215,INTRODUCTION.,names of certain of the vassals of Scandiano. But if he means to
216,INTRODUCTION.,"insinuate by this, that Boiardo was not also indebted to the other"
217,INTRODUCTION.,"source for his fictions and characters, as well might a critic of"
218,INTRODUCTION.,"to-day, contend that the author of the _Monks and Giants_, who"
219,INTRODUCTION.,"writes under the name of _Whistlecraft_, had not borrowed the idea"
220,INTRODUCTION.,"of their cause of quarrel from Pulci, because he has given"
221,INTRODUCTION.,ridiculous modern names to some of his giants; or that he had not
222,INTRODUCTION.,taken the leaders amongst his _dramatis personæ_ from the romances
223,INTRODUCTION.,"of the _Round Table_, because he has conferred ""two leopards'"
224,INTRODUCTION.,"faces,"" that is, his own arms, on the single knight, who perishes"
225,INTRODUCTION.,in Sir Tristram's successful expedition.
226,INTRODUCTION.,
227,INTRODUCTION.,"* A single circumstance, which I cite, because it can be"
228,INTRODUCTION.,"appreciated by every body, would convince me that such stories as"
229,INTRODUCTION.,"are to be found in the _Innamorato_, were not the growth of"
230,INTRODUCTION.,Boiardo's century. No author of that age could have imagined the
231,INTRODUCTION.,friendly ties of alliance and consanguinity between Christians and
232,INTRODUCTION.,"paynims, though such fictions are justified by facts: thus we"
233,INTRODUCTION.,learn from Gibbon that like relations existed between Greeks and
234,INTRODUCTION.,"Turks, and (as we are informed by Mr. Lockhart, in the preface to"
235,INTRODUCTION.,"his _Spanish Ballads_, a work which presents a striking pictures"
236,INTRODUCTION.,of manners as of passion) between Spaniards and Moors. Nor need
237,INTRODUCTION.,"such things surprise us, though the barriers which now separate"
238,INTRODUCTION.,"Christian and Mahomedan, render them impossible. Nations are like"
239,INTRODUCTION.,"individuals, and when they are brought into close and constant"
240,INTRODUCTION.,"intercourse, of whatever kind, their passions, good or bad, must"
241,INTRODUCTION.,be kindled by the contact.
242,INTRODUCTION.,
243,INTRODUCTION.,But if Boiardo has apparently taken his principal fictions from
244,INTRODUCTION.,"the romances of Charlemagne, he has also resorted to other known"
245,INTRODUCTION.,"quarries, and ransacked classical as well as romantic fable for"
246,INTRODUCTION.,materials.
247,INTRODUCTION.,
248,INTRODUCTION.,"This edifice, so constructed, which Boiardo did not live to"
249,INTRODUCTION.,"finish, soon underwent alteration and repairs. The first were made"
250,INTRODUCTION.,"by Niccolo degli Agostini, and later in the same century a second"
251,INTRODUCTION.,"and more celebrated _rifacimento_ of it, from which this"
252,INTRODUCTION.,"translation is composed, was produced by Francesco Berni; whose"
253,INTRODUCTION.,"name has given a distinctive epithet to the style of poetry, in"
254,INTRODUCTION.,"which he excelled, and of which he is vulgarly supposed to have"
255,INTRODUCTION.,been the inventor.
256,INTRODUCTION.,
257,INTRODUCTION.,"This man was born of poor but noble parents, in a small town of"
258,INTRODUCTION.,"Tuscany. He entered the church, to which he had evidently no"
259,INTRODUCTION.,"disposition, as a means of livelihood, and, though as unqualified"
260,INTRODUCTION.,"for servitude as for the discharge of his clerical duties, spent"
261,INTRODUCTION.,"the better part of his life in dependence. He appears, however, to"
262,INTRODUCTION.,"have been blessed with a vein of cheerfulness, which, seconded by"
263,INTRODUCTION.,"a lively imagination, enabled him to beguile the wearisome nature"
264,INTRODUCTION.,"of occupations, which were uncongenial to him; and of this he has"
265,INTRODUCTION.,"left many monuments in sonnets and pieces in _terza rima_, (styled"
266,INTRODUCTION.,"in Italian _capitoli_,) consisting of satires and various species"
267,INTRODUCTION.,of ludicrous composition. The titles of many of these sufficiently
268,INTRODUCTION.,"attest their whimsicality, such as his _Capitoli sugli Orinali,"
269,INTRODUCTION.,"sulle Anguille_, his _Eulogy of the Plague_, &c. &c. But the mode"
270,INTRODUCTION.,"in which he has handled this last subject, will give the best"
271,INTRODUCTION.,insight into the character of his humour. Having premised that
272,INTRODUCTION.,different persons gave a preference to different seasons—as the
273,INTRODUCTION.,"poet to the spring, and the reveller to the autumn,—he observes,"
274,INTRODUCTION.,"that one may well like the season of flowers, or the other that of"
275,INTRODUCTION.,"fruits; but that, for his part, he preferred the time of plague."
276,INTRODUCTION.,He then backs his predilection by a rehearsal of the advantages
277,INTRODUCTION.,attending this visitation; observing that a man is in such times
278,INTRODUCTION.,"free from solicitations of borrowers or creditors, and safe from"
279,INTRODUCTION.,disagreeable companions; that he has elbow-room at church and
280,INTRODUCTION.,"market, and can then only be said to be in the full possession of"
281,INTRODUCTION.,his natural liberty. He has rung all sorts of changes on this
282,INTRODUCTION.,"theme, and nothing can be more humorous than his details."
283,INTRODUCTION.,
284,INTRODUCTION.,"These are worked up with singular powers of diction, set off by"
285,INTRODUCTION.,"great apparent facility of style, and are no less remarkable for"
286,INTRODUCTION.,"music of rythm, richness of rhyme, and a happy boldness of"
287,INTRODUCTION.,"expression. In this respect there is some analogy, though no"
288,INTRODUCTION.,"likeness, between Berni and Dryden; and the real merits of both"
289,INTRODUCTION.,"are therefore imperfectly estimated by foreigners, and even by the"
290,INTRODUCTION.,"generality of their own countrymen. Many Italians, indeed,"
291,INTRODUCTION.,"consider Berni as a mere buffoon, which the English reader will"
292,INTRODUCTION.,"think less extraordinary, when he hears (as Lord Glenbervie*"
293,INTRODUCTION.,"observes, I think, in his notes to Ricciardetto,) that such an"
294,INTRODUCTION.,"opinion has been entertained in Italy, even with regard to"
295,INTRODUCTION.,Ariosto.
296,INTRODUCTION.,
297,INTRODUCTION.,"* I state this on Lord Glenbervie's sole authority, which is,"
298,INTRODUCTION.,"however, a weighty one. Such an opinion was probably current when"
299,INTRODUCTION.,he first knew Italy; but I should imagine it could hardly be
300,INTRODUCTION.,entertained at present.
301,INTRODUCTION.,
302,INTRODUCTION.,Better reasons may seem to palliate such a mistake of the real
303,INTRODUCTION.,"poetical character of Berni, than of that of Ariosto. Some of"
304,INTRODUCTION.,"these are of a general description, and others of a nature more"
305,INTRODUCTION.,"peculiarly applicable to his case. We may observe, as to the"
306,INTRODUCTION.,"first, that whoever indulges his wit, in whatever species of"
307,INTRODUCTION.,"composition, is usually misjudged; for wit, in the sight of the"
308,INTRODUCTION.,"world, overlays all the other qualities of an author, in whatever"
309,INTRODUCTION.,"act or pursuit he may be engaged. Thus a great English painter,"
310,INTRODUCTION.,"single in his walk, and distinguished by his various powers, is"
311,INTRODUCTION.,"looked upon by the multitude as a mere caricaturist, even where"
312,INTRODUCTION.,caricature is intended by him only as a foil to beauty; and
313,INTRODUCTION.,orators have for the same reason sunk into jesters in the opinion
314,INTRODUCTION.,"of the mob, though they may have been equally distinguished for"
315,INTRODUCTION.,argumentative discussion or pathetic effect.
316,INTRODUCTION.,
317,INTRODUCTION.,But other and more particular circumstances have tended to fix
318,INTRODUCTION.,this character upon Berni. Few men have a delicate perception of
319,INTRODUCTION.,"familiar expression, and still fewer yet have a nice feeling of"
320,INTRODUCTION.,"the delicacies of prosody,"
321,INTRODUCTION.,
322,INTRODUCTION.,Untwisting all the links that tie
323,INTRODUCTION.,The secret chain of harmony.
324,INTRODUCTION.,
325,INTRODUCTION.,"Now it is for the bold, however dexterous, use of language, and"
326,INTRODUCTION.,"rythm, that Berni is principally distinguished; and hence, as the"
327,INTRODUCTION.,means through which he works are imperfectly understood by the
328,INTRODUCTION.,"majority of his readers, his object has been frequently mistaken."
329,INTRODUCTION.,"I should cite, in illustration of this, his description of a storm"
330,INTRODUCTION.,"at sea, which has been often deemed burlesque, but in which the"
331,INTRODUCTION.,poet would be more justly considered as working a fine effect by
332,INTRODUCTION.,unwonted means.
333,INTRODUCTION.,
334,INTRODUCTION.,Let us try this question by the rules of analogy. Men in all
335,INTRODUCTION.,"countries resemble one another in the main, and where they are not"
336,INTRODUCTION.,"guided by a natural taste and judgment, lean upon some rule, which"
337,INTRODUCTION.,"is to direct them as an infallible guide. Depending upon this,"
338,INTRODUCTION.,"they seldom consider that it may be narrow, or of insufficient"
339,INTRODUCTION.,"support. Thus an Englishman who has learned to think about verse,"
340,INTRODUCTION.,"by the help of a few simple precepts*, which he believes to be"
341,INTRODUCTION.,"absolute, is taught to look upon the double rhyme as suited only"
342,INTRODUCTION.,to burlesque poetry. Yet Drummond's
343,INTRODUCTION.,
344,INTRODUCTION.,"""Methought desponding nightingales did borrow,"
345,INTRODUCTION.,"Plaint of my plaint, and sorrow of my sorrow;"""
346,INTRODUCTION.,
347,INTRODUCTION.,"and the description of him, who"
348,INTRODUCTION.,
349,INTRODUCTION.,"""Saw with wonder,"
350,INTRODUCTION.,"Vast magazines of ice and piles of thunder,""**"
351,INTRODUCTION.,
352,INTRODUCTION.,might be cited to prove what widely different effects are produced
353,INTRODUCTION.,"by the same weapon, as it is differently wielded. But, impressed"
354,INTRODUCTION.,"with the notions of the laws of verse which I have specified, that"
355,INTRODUCTION.,"is, not knowing that almost all such metrical rules as have been"
356,INTRODUCTION.,"alluded to, are merely conditional, some Italians***, and"
357,INTRODUCTION.,"certainly, almost all English readers of Italian poetry, suppose"
358,INTRODUCTION.,"the triple rhyme, (_la rima sdrucciola_) or dactyl, as it is"
359,INTRODUCTION.,"called by us, to be as exclusively applied to ludicrous"
360,INTRODUCTION.,"composition in Italian, as the double rhyme is imagined to be in"
361,INTRODUCTION.,English; and this is perhaps one cause why some of Berni's
362,INTRODUCTION.,"stanzas, which abound in triple rhymes, have been so utterly"
363,INTRODUCTION.,misconceived in England. Yet Berni and Ariosto have frequently
364,INTRODUCTION.,employed the _versi sdruccioli_ where they have aimed at a bold or
365,INTRODUCTION.,"pathetic effect, though they have also undoubtedly been used by"
366,INTRODUCTION.,them to heighten that of comic or satirical composition. Caro the
367,INTRODUCTION.,cotemporary of Berni is even profuse of triple rhymes in his
368,INTRODUCTION.,"translation of the Æneid; lyric poets, after the example of"
369,INTRODUCTION.,"Chiabrera, often insert them in the sublimest of their odes; and"
370,INTRODUCTION.,"one, who lately died full of years, managed the _rime sdrucciole_"
371,INTRODUCTION.,"so easily, as to compose whole poems with them, and with such"
372,INTRODUCTION.,"dignity, both of versification and expression, as (in the opinion"
373,INTRODUCTION.,of a distinguished Italian friend already cited) to vie with Tasso
374,INTRODUCTION.,and Petrarch.
375,INTRODUCTION.,
376,INTRODUCTION.,"* For example, there is no rule deemed more absolute, and yet"
377,INTRODUCTION.,there is none which admits more exceptions than the maxim
378,INTRODUCTION.,"forbidding a line of ten monosyllables. For monosyllables, in"
379,INTRODUCTION.,"French and English, are often such only to the eye, such words"
380,INTRODUCTION.,"being frequently, in both languages, melted into each other. Hence"
381,INTRODUCTION.,"many good English verses consist of ten words, as that of Dryden,"
382,INTRODUCTION.,"which will be in the recollection of every body,"
383,INTRODUCTION.,
384,INTRODUCTION.,"""Arms and the man I sing, &c."""
385,INTRODUCTION.,
386,INTRODUCTION.,"and the French cite as beautiful a line of Racine, which is"
387,INTRODUCTION.,"composed of twelve,"
388,INTRODUCTION.,
389,INTRODUCTION.,"""Lej ur n'est pas plus pur que le fond de mon cœur."""
390,INTRODUCTION.,
391,INTRODUCTION.,** I quote from memory.
392,INTRODUCTION.,
393,INTRODUCTION.,*** Thus Goldoni in one of his comedies introduces a man
394,INTRODUCTION.,improvising in triple rhymes for the sake of producing a ludicrous
395,INTRODUCTION.,"effect. Goldoni, however, (it must be confessed,) is no authority"
396,INTRODUCTION.,in questions of language or of versification.
397,INTRODUCTION.,
398,INTRODUCTION.,Now let a man keep such doctrines in mind; let him come to the
399,INTRODUCTION.,consideration of Berni's storm with a memory imbued with the
400,INTRODUCTION.,sights and sounds seen and heard in one; let him consider all
401,INTRODUCTION.,"circumstances of metre, not absolutely, but conditionally; that"
402,INTRODUCTION.,"is, in their relation to each other and the thing described, and"
403,INTRODUCTION.,"he will then, I believe, enter into the real spirit in which the"
404,INTRODUCTION.,"poet executed this description, and contemplate him with very"
405,INTRODUCTION.,different eyes from those with which he viewed him before.
406,INTRODUCTION.,
407,INTRODUCTION.,"Another cause of misconception, to which I have already alluded,"
408,INTRODUCTION.,"has probably more misled the mob of readers of Italian poetry,"
409,INTRODUCTION.,natives as well as foreigners. I mean the language of Berni; and
410,INTRODUCTION.,"as to this, certainly few very few, are capable of appreciating"
411,INTRODUCTION.,"his skill, or even of making out his track. There is indeed, I"
412,INTRODUCTION.,"believe, no poet of any country, who has attempted so difficult a"
413,INTRODUCTION.,"flight; a flight of unwearied wing, struck out with courage, and"
414,INTRODUCTION.,maintained only by the most incessant exertion and care.
415,INTRODUCTION.,
416,INTRODUCTION.,Traces of these are seen in what may be called the charts on which
417,INTRODUCTION.,"he has pricked out his course, and which, I understand, witness as"
418,INTRODUCTION.,"much to his diligence, as Ariosto's attest the care with which he"
419,INTRODUCTION.,accomplished his most extraordinary voyage. The documents to which
420,INTRODUCTION.,"I allude, are the original MSS. of the _Innamorato_, preserved at"
421,INTRODUCTION.,"Brescia. As I was ignorant of the existence of these, during two"
422,INTRODUCTION.,"residences which I made in Italy, I can only speak of them on the"
423,INTRODUCTION.,"testimony of others; but an Italian critic, whom I have often"
424,INTRODUCTION.,"quoted, and from whose authority upon such points I would almost"
425,INTRODUCTION.,"say there was no appeal, once assured me these are as much blotted"
426,INTRODUCTION.,as those of Ariosto at Ferrara; and that Berni seems to have
427,INTRODUCTION.,"usually clothed his thoughts in ornate language at first, which he"
428,INTRODUCTION.,"rejected on after-consideration, simplifying, but at the same time"
429,INTRODUCTION.,"improving, his diction, as he proceeded, till he arrived at that"
430,INTRODUCTION.,"exquisite happiness of expression, that _curiosa felicitas_, which"
431,INTRODUCTION.,makes his principal charm. It is hence that he is the most
432,INTRODUCTION.,"untranslatable of authors; since in copying him, it is not only a"
433,INTRODUCTION.,"question of imitating colours, but the fine and more elaborate"
434,INTRODUCTION.,touches of a peculiar pencil.
435,INTRODUCTION.,
436,INTRODUCTION.,"While, however, it is clear that the versification and diction"
437,INTRODUCTION.,"make the great charms of the _Innamorato_, these beauties should"
438,INTRODUCTION.,not throw his other excellencies into shade; and the openings of
439,INTRODUCTION.,"the different cantos, which he has engrafted on the original work"
440,INTRODUCTION.,"of Boiardo, sometimes original, and sometimes imitated from the"
441,INTRODUCTION.,"older poets, are not greatly inferior to those which Ariosto has"
442,INTRODUCTION.,"prefixed to the several cantos of the Furioso, in imitation of"
443,INTRODUCTION.,"him; no, not even in the higher claims of poetical merit."
444,INTRODUCTION.,
445,INTRODUCTION.,"These sometimes consist of moral reflections, arising out of the"
446,INTRODUCTION.,narrative; and the following may remind the reader of one of those
447,INTRODUCTION.,little gems scattered through the plays of Shakspeare:—
448,INTRODUCTION.,
449,INTRODUCTION.,"Who steals a bugle-horn, a ring, a steed,"
450,INTRODUCTION.,"Or such like worthless thing, has some discretion."
451,INTRODUCTION.,'Tis petty larceny.—Not such his deed
452,INTRODUCTION.,"Who robs us of our fame, our best possession;"
453,INTRODUCTION.,"And he who takes our labour's worthiest meed,"
454,INTRODUCTION.,May well be deemed a felon by profession;
455,INTRODUCTION.,Who so much more our hate and scourge deserves.
456,INTRODUCTION.,As from the rule of right he wider swerves.
457,INTRODUCTION.,
458,INTRODUCTION.,"Sometimes indulging in a declamation against vices or follies, he"
459,INTRODUCTION.,makes his satire more poignant by allusions to some prevalent
460,INTRODUCTION.,"practice of the day: thus, in a sally against avarice, he attacks"
461,INTRODUCTION.,those who masqued it under the disguise of hypocrisy in the
462,INTRODUCTION.,following stanza:
463,INTRODUCTION.,
464,INTRODUCTION.,"This other, under show of an adviser"
465,INTRODUCTION.,And practiser of what is strict and right;
466,INTRODUCTION.,"But being in effect a rogue and miser,"
467,INTRODUCTION.,Cloisters a dozen daughters out of sight:
468,INTRODUCTION.,And fain would have the pretty creatures wiser
469,INTRODUCTION.,Than their frail sisters; but mistakes them quite;
470,INTRODUCTION.,"For they are like the rest, and set the group"
471,INTRODUCTION.,"Of monks, and priests, and abbots, cock-a-hoop."
472,INTRODUCTION.,
473,INTRODUCTION.,"The following extract, illustrating a philosophical dogma of his"
474,INTRODUCTION.,"age, taken from the opening of the forty-sixth canto, is of"
475,INTRODUCTION.,"another description, and may serve as a specimen of the variety of"
476,INTRODUCTION.,"his vein, and the odd ingenuity with which he winds in and out of"
477,INTRODUCTION.,his argument; sometimes bearing up for his harbour when in the
478,INTRODUCTION.,"middle of a digression; and then, when he seems to feel himself"
479,INTRODUCTION.,"sure of a retreat, indulging in a new sally, in which he however"
480,INTRODUCTION.,never entirely loses sight of his port.

487,INTRODUCTION.,"And I may say that long and deep, and wide"
488,INTRODUCTION.,"And middling, good and bad, are found in it."

496,INTRODUCTION.,"And haply here too moist, or there too dry."
497,INTRODUCTION.,"Here foaming hoarse, and there with murmur bland,"
498,INTRODUCTION.,"Streams glide, or torrents tumble from on high."

532,INTRODUCTION.,
533,INTRODUCTION.,6.
534,INTRODUCTION.,"As these are worthier, more or less, so they"
535,INTRODUCTION.,"Abound with lead or gold; and practised wight,"

540,INTRODUCTION.,"Who strange vagaries play, like men possessed;"
541,INTRODUCTION.,"_Tarantulated_*, as 'tis there express'd."
542,INTRODUCTION.,
543,INTRODUCTION.,* The Tarantula is now known to be harmless. The cause of its
544,INTRODUCTION.,"supposed mischievous effects, and the efficacy of the mode of"
545,INTRODUCTION.,curing them are perhaps easily explained. People are in all
546,INTRODUCTION.,countries (though they are imagined to be peculiarly so in
547,INTRODUCTION.,"England) exposed to attacks of melancholy, which arise out of some"
548,INTRODUCTION.,"physical cause, whether indigestion, or other bodily complaint."
549,INTRODUCTION.,The doctors of Calabria attributed this to the sting of the
550,INTRODUCTION.,"tarantula, which is assuredly not more extravagant than a popular"
551,INTRODUCTION.,English medical author's ascribing jaundice to the bite of a mad
552,INTRODUCTION.,"dog. The patient, delighted to find a cause for his complaint, was"
553,INTRODUCTION.,"easily, by leading questions, brought to recollect that he had, at"
554,INTRODUCTION.,"some time or other, felt a prick, which probably proceeded from"
555,INTRODUCTION.,the sting of a tarantula. Dancing was the remedy prescribed; and
556,INTRODUCTION.,"this, as exciting the animal spirits, &c. may very well have"
557,INTRODUCTION.,operated a cure of the real disease. The patients were to be
558,INTRODUCTION.,"played to, as Berni states, till a tune was struck which pleased"
559,INTRODUCTION.,"their fancy, and animated them to exertion. The Tarantella, an air"
560,INTRODUCTION.,"supposed to be particularly stimulating in such a case, is still a"
561,INTRODUCTION.,popular dance in the south of Italy. Modern philosophers have
562,INTRODUCTION.,found out that the tarantula has no venom.
563,INTRODUCTION.,
564,INTRODUCTION.,7.
565,INTRODUCTION.,"For this, 'tis needful, touching sharp or flat."
566,INTRODUCTION.,To seek a sound which may the patients please;

570,INTRODUCTION.,"And still with various offer tempt and tease,"

699,INTRODUCTION.,"Flame out of smoke, instead of smoke from light;"
700,INTRODUCTION.,With wise Ulysses' acts to fill our ears.
701,INTRODUCTION.,To the more wonderment of him who hears.
702,INTRODUCTION.,
703,INTRODUCTION.,So much for the poetry of Berni. His life was not such as
704,INTRODUCTION.,"reflected any lustre on his works. This, if we reject some foul"
705,INTRODUCTION.,"imputations cast upon him, was, to say the least of it,"
706,INTRODUCTION.,"disreputable. It is, however, certain, that being at last"
707,INTRODUCTION.,"established in a canonry at Florence, he lived there in high and"
708,INTRODUCTION.,"accomplished society. This fact, however, in a profligate age,"
709,INTRODUCTION.,"like that in which he flourished, proves nothing in his favour;"
710,INTRODUCTION.,"and, if we listened to the stories of his biographers, we might"
711,INTRODUCTION.,suppose him even to have been courted for some of his vicious
712,INTRODUCTION.,propensities: for one of these writers tells us he was excited by
713,INTRODUCTION.,"the cardinal Ippolito de' Medici to poison the duke Alexander,"
714,INTRODUCTION.,"against whom he had a private pique; another, would have us"
715,INTRODUCTION.,believe that he was tempted by the duke to poison the cardinal;
716,INTRODUCTION.,and (to complicate the matter yet more) that the cardinal or the
717,INTRODUCTION.,"duke, or both, had poison administered to Berni himself, upon his"
718,INTRODUCTION.,"refusal. The dates, however, of their respective deaths, are at"
719,INTRODUCTION.,variance with these strange assertions; and if such certain means
720,INTRODUCTION.,"of contradiction were wanting, the internal evidence of Berni's"
721,INTRODUCTION.,"character, however vicious, might be almost sufficient to refute"
722,INTRODUCTION.,"such improbable calumnies. It may be said, indeed, that perhaps no"
723,INTRODUCTION.,"one was ever selected as a probable agent of guilt, who seems to"
724,INTRODUCTION.,have been so little capable of engaging in the sort of crimes
725,INTRODUCTION.,which were expected of him.
726,INTRODUCTION.,
727,INTRODUCTION.,As a proof of this we might almost refer to the picture which he
728,INTRODUCTION.,"has given of himself, and which carries with it every warrant of"
729,INTRODUCTION.,resemblance. In one of the cantos of the last book of the
730,INTRODUCTION.,"_Innamorato_, he describes a number of persons as having become"
731,INTRODUCTION.,"the victims of a fairy, of whom they afterwards remain the"
732,INTRODUCTION.,"voluntary prisoners. Among these he has, in imitation of certain"
733,INTRODUCTION.,"painters, introduced himself with another known character of the"
734,INTRODUCTION.,"day: a circumstance which, together with the nature of the"
735,INTRODUCTION.,"episode, might lead one to suspect that Thomson was indebted to"
736,INTRODUCTION.,"this fiction for his _Castle of Indolence_. He has, however, given"
737,INTRODUCTION.,"the tenants of his ""bowers of ease,"" a character so much more"
738,INTRODUCTION.,"intellectual than that of Berni's actors, that he may very fairly"
739,INTRODUCTION.,"pretend to the praise of original composition, even if his work be"
740,INTRODUCTION.,an imitation instead of a mere accidental coincidence; which I am
741,INTRODUCTION.,more tempted to believe.* But I draw the curtain of Berni's
742,INTRODUCTION.,picture.
743,INTRODUCTION.,
744,INTRODUCTION.,* I do not recollect any authority for Thomson's having been
745,INTRODUCTION.,conversant with Italian poetry; and I think that a view of his
746,INTRODUCTION.,works would lead to a contrary supposition. Thus I should say that
747,INTRODUCTION.,though no man could copy what he actually saw with a nicer hand or
748,INTRODUCTION.,"eye, no man had more need of study in the Italian school of ideal"
749,INTRODUCTION.,picture than this English poet. In his drawings from nature his
750,INTRODUCTION.,"colouring is as inimitable as his design; and his bird, who"
751,INTRODUCTION.,
752,INTRODUCTION.,"""Shivers every feather with desire,"""
753,INTRODUCTION.,
754,INTRODUCTION.,is painted with the precision as well as the force of the Flemish
755,INTRODUCTION.,pencil. Yet he has personified Autumn as
756,INTRODUCTION.,
757,INTRODUCTION.,"""_Crowned with the sickle_ and the wheaten sheaf,"""
758,INTRODUCTION.,
759,INTRODUCTION.,"thus putting on his head what should have been in his hand, and"
760,INTRODUCTION.,"presenting us a ludicrous figure surmounted by a ""crumpled horn."""
761,INTRODUCTION.,No Italian poet would have painted from nature with Thomson's
762,INTRODUCTION.,marvellous precision; and no Italian poet would have committed
763,INTRODUCTION.,"such gross offences against propriety as he has, in his imaginary"
764,INTRODUCTION.,pictures.

985,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"Having in the preceding part of this introduction, given some"
986,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,account of the mode in which I have executed my task as a
987,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"translator, it may be expected that I should give some information"
988,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"respecting my labours as an editor. To speak frankly, I have none"
989,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"to give: having annexed no commentary, or, at least, nothing"
990,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"worthy of being called a commentary, to this work. Some readers"
991,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"may, perhaps, think I have in this neglected my duty, and reproach"
992,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,me with not having pointed out the sources from which many of the
993,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"fictions in the _Innamorato_ are borrowed, or at least the points"
994,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,of resemblance which may be found between many of these and other
995,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"ancient stories. It appeared, however, to me, that my readers were"
996,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,as likely as myself to be conversant with incidents to be found in
997,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"the _Spectator_, _Persian Tales_, _Arabian Nights_, and"
998,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"_Bibliothèque Orientale_. Others who will, perhaps, thank me for"
999,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"sparing them such a display of common-place knowledge may,"
1000,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"however, think I have erred in having done nothing to illustrate"
1001,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"the allegory of the _Innamorato_. If I have not, the omission has"
1002,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,arisen from a conviction of the inutility of such an attempt. I
1003,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,have read much that has been written upon the allegory of the
1004,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"_Furioso_, yet never met with any explanation of it, which I"
1005,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"considered as satisfactory to myself, though I was persuaded that"
1006,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,the commentators were right. Holding obscurity to be one source of
1007,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"the sublime in this branch of imagination, though I will not"
1008,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"venture to extend the position further, it appears to me that the"
1009,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"reader always best fills up an indistinct outline, according to"
1010,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"his own fancy, and is more likely to derive pleasure from doing"
1011,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"so, than from a solution which usually presents him with something"
1012,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,very different from what he had preconceived. It is this
1013,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,consideration which has restrained me from doing more than
1014,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,throwing out a few ideas which suggested themselves on some parts
1015,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"of Boiardo's allegory, and no wish to avoid any trouble which I"
1016,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,might have thought satisfactorily bestowed on it. Still less have
1017,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,I been influenced by any fear of that ridicule which is so readily
1018,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"discharged upon Italian commentators, or those who report their"
1019,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"lucubrations; for I can safely say, that I should have pursued the"
1020,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"research to which I have alluded, if I had thought I could have"
1021,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"done so with any satisfaction to myself, though I had met with no"
1022,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,better recompence than that of being compared to the ass who
1023,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"carried off the dead body of the sphynx, after her enigma had been"
1024,BOOK III. CANTO VII.,"unriddled, and she herself slain by Œdipus."

1105,BOOK I.,"placed the dukes and marquisses; and at the third, the counts and"
1106,BOOK I.,simple knights. Those of the house of Maganza were especially
1107,BOOK I.,"honoured, and above all the others, Gano of Poictiers. Rinaldo saw"
1108,BOOK I.,"this with eyes of fire; the more so that these traitors, laughing"
1109,BOOK I.,"amongst themselves, were mocking him as not equally"

1171,BOOK I.,"Merlin are always placed by the first romancers, to wit, those of"
1172,BOOK I.,"the Round Table, in Britain; and their constantly laying their"
1173,BOOK I.,"scene in our island, and choosing their actors from thence, has"
1174,BOOK I.,"led M. de la Rue, and after him, Mr. George Ellis, to suppose that"
1175,BOOK I.,"these earliest romancers were subjects of English kings, who wrote"
1176,BOOK I.,"for the amusement of their court, the language of which was"
1177,BOOK I.,"Norman. The romancers, however, who celebrated Charlemagne, and"
1178,BOOK I.,"who were doubtless French, very naturally chose their heroes from"
1179,BOOK I.,"France, and transferred the scene to that country. To these, I"
1180,BOOK I.,"have already said, that Boiardo and Ariosto arc mainly indebted"
1181,BOOK I.,for their fictions.
1182,BOOK I.,
1183,BOOK I.,"She remains kneeling awhile before Charles, as waiting his answer."
1184,BOOK I.,"All behold the damsel in mute admiration; but, above all, Orlando,"
1185,BOOK I.,"approaching her with downcast eyes, gives the first signs of the"
1186,BOOK I.,passion which was destined to be his ruin. While Orlando is thus
1187,BOOK I.,"love-stricken, he is not single in his folly; and even the grey-haired"
1188,BOOK I.,"Namus, and Charles himself, participate in it. But, while"
1189,BOOK I.,"these and all the rest gaze upon her in silence, Ferrau is so"
1190,BOOK I.,transported with passion as to be about to snatch her up in his
1191,BOOK I.,"arms, and transport her away from the presence. Respect for"
1192,BOOK I.,"Charlemagne, however, restrains him. While this is passing,"
1193,BOOK I.,"Malagigi, brother to Rinaldo, a puissant magician, closely"
1194,BOOK I.,"observes the strangers, and reads in them some mysterious purpose,"
1195,BOOK I.,different from what they pretended to be the object of their
1196,BOOK I.,expedition. Charlemagne had now recovered from his embarrassment
1197,BOOK I.,"sufficiently to speak, and plied Angelica with different subjects"
1198,BOOK I.,"of discourse, for the purpose of detaining her; but at length, not"
1199,BOOK I.,"being able to prolong the interview with decency, gave her a"
1200,BOOK I.,dismissal by according the request.
1201,BOOK I.,
1202,BOOK I.,"The damsel has scarce left the city, when Malagigi"
1203,BOOK I.,
1204,BOOK I.,"Still fearing for the king, and full of care."
1205,BOOK I.,"Flies to his book, retiring from the revel,"
1206,BOOK I.,"To know the secret purpose of the pair,"
1207,BOOK I.,And at what aim the knight and damsel level.
1208,BOOK I.,"He reads; and, as he reads, in upper air"
1209,BOOK I.,"Is heard a voice, and next appears a devil,"
1210,BOOK I.,"Who bids, in haughty tone, the wise magician"
1211,BOOK I.,"Proclaim his will, and give him his dismission."
1212,BOOK I.,
1213,BOOK I.,"Malagigi having proposed his questions, the fiend informs him that"
1214,BOOK I.,"Angelica is an enemy come to put a notable scorn upon Charlemagne,"
1215,BOOK I.,"and that her father, who is an ancient Indian king, called"
1216,BOOK I.,"Galaphron, of Catay, has dispatched her for this object,"
1217,BOOK I.,"accompanied by her brother, Argalia, and not Uberto, as she"
1218,BOOK I.,"falsely designated him: that she is full of malice, and read in"
1219,BOOK I.,"every sort of magic, whilst her brother is as valiant in arms,"
1220,BOOK I.,"gifted with a courser of marvellous swiftness, and armed with an"
1221,BOOK I.,"enchanted lance: the virtue of this is such, that no knight (no,"
1222,BOOK I.,not even Orlando or Rinaldo) could resist its push; nor are his
1223,BOOK I.,other arms inferior to his spear. To this; he has received from
1224,BOOK I.,"his father a ring, which, when on the finger, makes enchantment of"
1225,BOOK I.,"no effect, and when placed between the lips renders the wearer"
1226,BOOK I.,"invisible. Galaphron, it is added, reckons much upon these gifts,"
1227,BOOK I.,but yet more upon the beauty of his daughter. Hence he has
1228,BOOK I.,"dispatched Argalia with the damsel, in trust, that she shall"
1229,BOOK I.,"entice the Paladins into duel with her brother, who, unhorsing"
1230,BOOK I.,"them, will send them prisoners to Catay. Malagigi is much"
1231,BOOK I.,"disturbed at the devil's news, and determines to seek the damsel"
1232,BOOK I.,"in person, and frustrate her design. Argalia was already reposing"
1233,BOOK I.,"himself under a fair pavilion, pitched near the stair of Merlin,"
1234,BOOK I.,while
1235,BOOK I.,
1236,BOOK I.,"Angelica beneath a pine was sleeping,"
1237,BOOK I.,"Her long light tresses scattered on the grass,"
1238,BOOK I.,"Beside a limpid font, whose waters, leaping,"
1239,BOOK I.,Fell back into a pool as clear as glass.
1240,BOOK I.,A giant had the damsel in his keeping.
1241,BOOK I.,Who might for a reposing angel pass.
1242,BOOK I.,Her brother's ring the sleeping lady wore.
1243,BOOK I.,Whose hidden virtues were described before.
1244,BOOK I.,
1245,BOOK I.,"False Malagigi, borne on fiendish steed,"
1246,BOOK I.,Meantime through fields of air in silence swept
1247,BOOK I.,"And now, dismounting on the flow'ry mead,"
1248,BOOK I.,Approached the weary damsel where she slept.
1249,BOOK I.,"By that grim giant watched, who, for her need."
1250,BOOK I.,"Good guard upon the sleeping lady kept,"
1251,BOOK I.,While others of her following paced the sward.
1252,BOOK I.,And (such their charge) kept wider watch and ward.
1253,BOOK I.,
1254,BOOK I.,"The necromancer smiles at seeing the whole party, as it were,"
1255,BOOK I.,"delivered over into his hands, and opens his books for the purpose"
1256,BOOK I.,"of beginning his operations. Whilst he reads, a heavy slumber"
1257,BOOK I.,"falls upon the watchers; and, having drawn his sword, (for he was"
1258,BOOK I.,"a belted knight,) he approaches the princess with the intention of"
1259,BOOK I.,"putting her to death. He yields, however, to the enchantment of"
1260,BOOK I.,"beauty, and determines to make a different use of the opportunity."
1261,BOOK I.,"Not aware that the enchanted ring was on her finger, which she had"
1262,BOOK I.,"accidentally received from Argalia, he conceives he has rendered"
1263,BOOK I.,"her sleep as fast as that of her followers, and clasps her in his"
1264,BOOK I.,"arms; but the ring, which is proof against all spells, does its"
1265,BOOK I.,"duty. Angelica wakes with a shriek, and Argalia rushes to her"
1266,BOOK I.,"assistance. Being unprovided with other weapon, he avenges the"
1267,BOOK I.,insult offered to his sister with a cudgel; but as he is bruising
1268,BOOK I.,"the unfortunate Malagigi, Angelica cries to him to bind the"
1269,BOOK I.,"ravisher fast, while she holds him; as he is a potent necromancer,"
1270,BOOK I.,"who, but for the assistance of the ring, would laugh at chains."
1271,BOOK I.,"Argalia runs immediately to wake the giant, but finding, after"
1272,BOOK I.,"some time, that this was a fruitless attempt, he himself binds"
1273,BOOK I.,"Malagigi, hands and feet. The damsel this while possesses herself"
1274,BOOK I.,"of the magician's book, and having evoked his fiends, bids them"
1275,BOOK I.,"convey her prisoner instantly to King Galaphron, and inform him"
1276,BOOK I.,"that her project goes well, since she has mastered the only enemy"
1277,BOOK I.,"whom she had reason to fear. Malagigi is confined by Galaphron, in"
1278,BOOK I.,"a dungeon under the sea. In the mean time, Angelica dissolves the"
1279,BOOK I.,enchanted sleep of her followers.
1280,BOOK I.,
1281,BOOK I.,"While these things are going on, all is uproar at Paris, since"
1282,BOOK I.,Orlando insists upon being the first to try the adventure at the
1283,BOOK I.,stair of Merlin. This is resented by the other pretenders to
1284,BOOK I.,"Angelica, and all contest his right to the precedency. The tumult"
1285,BOOK I.,"is stilled by the usual expedient of casting lots, and the first"
1286,BOOK I.,"prize is drawn by Astolpho. Ferrau has the second, and the giant"
1287,BOOK I.,"Grandonio the third. Next to these came Berlinghier and Otho, then"
1288,BOOK I.,"Charles himself, and (as his ill fortune would have it), after"
1289,BOOK I.,"thirty more, the indignant Orlando."
1290,BOOK I.,
1291,BOOK I.,"The character of the holder of the first lot is now developed, who"
1292,BOOK I.,is to play a considerable part in the romance.
1293,BOOK I.,
1294,BOOK I.,"Astolpho, who the winning ticket bore,"
1295,BOOK I.,"Was nimble, and with youthful beauty blest;"
1296,BOOK I.,"And, for these gentle gifts, was prized before"
1297,BOOK I.,"Christian or Pagan princes, east or west;"
1298,BOOK I.,"With that, was rich, and full of courteous lore."
1299,BOOK I.,And always loved to go in gilded vest!
1300,BOOK I.,One only fault the prince's pride might humble;
1301,BOOK I.,Sir Turpin tells us he was given to tumble.
1302,BOOK I.,
1303,BOOK I.,Astolpho goes forth upon his adventure with great gaiety of dress
1304,BOOK I.,"and manner, and Argalia and he encounter, after having with much"
1305,BOOK I.,"courtesy renewed the engagements, which were before specified as"
1306,BOOK I.,regulating the duel. They engage; when Astolpho is immediately
1307,BOOK I.,tilted out of his saddle. His rage and surprise are excessive; but
1308,BOOK I.,his painful feelings receive some relief from the kindness of
1309,BOOK I.,"Angelica, who, moved to compassion for his misfortune, and"
1310,BOOK I.,"somewhat touched by his gallantry and grace, grants him the"
1311,BOOK I.,liberty of the pavilion; where he is treated with every sort of
1312,BOOK I.,kindness and respect. Here he is assigned a magnificent bed; the
1313,BOOK I.,"others retreat to _their_ couches, and thus passes the night."
1314,BOOK I.,
1315,BOOK I.,"The sleepers are awakened at dawn by Ferrau's bugle, who, as next"
1316,BOOK I.,"upon the list, claims the second course. Argalia goes forth to"
1317,BOOK I.,"meet him, clad in his enchanted arms, and mounted on his horse"
1318,BOOK I.,"Rabican, who is described as blacker than a crow, save that three"
1319,BOOK I.,"of his legs were pie-balled, and that his forehead was marked with"
1320,BOOK I.,a star.
1321,BOOK I.,
1322,BOOK I.,"Ferrau undergoes the fate of Astolpho; but when unhorsed, refuses"
1323,BOOK I.,"to abide, like him, the established conditions, and springing upon"
1324,BOOK I.,"his feet, in despite of the protest of Argalia, renews the battle"
1325,BOOK I.,"with his sword. Argalia's giants now rush between the combatants,"
1326,BOOK I.,"and attack him; their master, however, in courtesy, retires from"
1327,BOOK I.,"such unequal fray, and stands apart till his giants are"
1328,BOOK I.,"overthrown. He then renews the contest, and Astolpho, who had been"
1329,BOOK I.,"waked by the disturbance, in vain seeks to allay it. Ferrau says"
1330,BOOK I.,"that he is no vassal of Charles's, and therefore is not bound by"
1331,BOOK I.,"any pact respecting the duel, which he may have made with"
1332,BOOK I.,Angelica: and that he is resolved to win her and wear her. In
1333,BOOK I.,"answer to the observation of Argalia, that he is without a helmet,"
1334,BOOK I.,"which had been beat off and broken by the golden lance, he"
1335,BOOK I.,"observes, that without one, he is a fair match for his opposite."
1336,BOOK I.,
1337,BOOK I.,"This dispute had been carried on by the combatants on foot, but"
1338,BOOK I.,"they now remount in order to decide it on horseback, when Argalia"
1339,BOOK I.,"in his fury forgets his lance, which he has left leaning against a"
1340,BOOK I.,"pine. Many blows had been given and taken without effect, when the"
1341,BOOK I.,"two knights paused in mutual astonishment, and Argalia informed"
1342,BOOK I.,"Ferrau that his efforts were fruitless, as his armour was"
1343,BOOK I.,enchanted; a communication which Ferrau repaid by observing that
1344,BOOK I.,his skin was invulnerable with the exception of one side. The
1345,BOOK I.,"recital of these gifts, which produces a sort of reciprocal"
1346,BOOK I.,"respect, leads them to a further parley; in which Argalia agrees"
1347,BOOK I.,"to give Ferrau Angelica to wife, provided she consents to the"
1348,BOOK I.,"arrangement. But Angelica, who is startled by Ferrau's ugliness"
1349,BOOK I.,"and fierceness, and more especially by his ill-shaped head and"
1350,BOOK I.,"black hair, her favour being especially set upon a light-haired"
1351,BOOK I.,"lover, entreats her brother, rather than sacrifice her to such a"
1352,BOOK I.,"man, to renew his battle which had been suspended, while she"
1353,BOOK I.,transports herself by magic to Catay; she then observes he may
1354,BOOK I.,"watch his opportunity, to escape and follow her to the wood of"
1355,BOOK I.,"Arden, where she will wait his arrival."
1356,BOOK I.,
1357,BOOK I.,"He, in consequence, communicates to Ferrau the refusal of his"
1358,BOOK I.,"sister. The battle is renewed; and upon its renewal, Angelica"
1359,BOOK I.,"disappears. She is soon followed by Argalia, who turns his back"
1360,BOOK I.,"upon his adversary. Ferrau pursues, but sees no traces either of"
1361,BOOK I.,"the damsel or the knight. In the meantime Astolpho, who finds"
1362,BOOK I.,"himself at liberty, puts on his armour, and his own lance having"
1363,BOOK I.,"been splintered in the joust, takes, unconscious of its virtues,"
1364,BOOK I.,"that of Argalia, which was left leaning against the pine."
1365,BOOK I.,"Returning home, he meets Rinaldo, who had wandered out to the"
1366,BOOK I.,"wood, to learn the fortune of Ferrau. He, too, hearing of the"
1367,BOOK I.,"disappearance of Angelica, gallops away in pursuit, while Astolpho"
1368,BOOK I.,continues his road to Paris.
1369,BOOK I.,
1370,BOOK I.,"Here Orlando seeks him, and learns all that has passed. Distracted"
1371,BOOK I.,"with the news, and, above all, jealous of Rinaldo, he too, waits,"
1372,BOOK I.,only till evening to join in the pursuit; when he makes his secret
1373,BOOK I.,"sally, and rides towards the wood of Arden. Thus, three champions,"
1374,BOOK I.,"to wit, Ferrau, Rinaldo, and Orlando are entered in the chase."
1375,BOOK I.,
1376,BOOK I.,"This, while Charlemagne is proceeding in his preparations for the"
1377,BOOK I.,"tournament, the prize of which was to be the _Crown of Roses_."
1378,BOOK I.,"Many fair feats had already been wrought, and the knights are in"
1379,BOOK I.,"the heat of the jousts, when Astolpho pricks forth into the"
1380,BOOK I.,medley*; but his courser falls with him and dislocates his foot.
1381,BOOK I.,"All regret this accident of the English prince, who is carried to"
1382,BOOK I.,his palace where his foot is set. The jousts are continued by the
1383,BOOK I.,"others, from whom Grandonio the giant bears away the honours of"
1384,BOOK I.,"the field, wounding and unhorsing knights on all sides. In the"
1385,BOOK I.,"meantime,"

1387,BOOK I.,"* Mischia, melée."
1388,BOOK I.,
1389,BOOK I.,"Astolpho was return'd into the square,"
1390,BOOK I.,"His single faulchion to his girdle tied,"
1391,BOOK I.,"And rode in gallant guise an ambling mare,"
1392,BOOK I.,Unarm'd and weaponless in all beside:
1393,BOOK I.,"And laugh'd and loiter'd with the ladies there,"
1394,BOOK I.,And jested with the circle far and wide:
1395,BOOK I.,"While he thus idly chatted, Gryphon fell,"
1396,BOOK I.,Thrust by Grandonio from his lofty sell.
1397,BOOK I.,
1398,BOOK I.,All who contend with Grandonio suffer the same destiny; while the
1399,BOOK I.,outrageous Pagan overwhelms Charles and his paladins with
1400,BOOK I.,"invective. On the other hand, Charles vents threats and"
1401,BOOK I.,"imprecations upon the absent Orlando, Rinaldo, and Gano,"
1402,BOOK I.,expressing at the same time his earnest desire to be revenged upon
1403,BOOK I.,the Saracens.
1404,BOOK I.,
1405,BOOK I.,"Astolpho, hearing this, retreats, unobserved, to his palace, arms"
1406,BOOK I.,"himself at all points and reappears amongst the combatants; not,"
1407,BOOK I.,"as the author observes, that he expects to do himself much honour;"
1408,BOOK I.,in which opinion he seems to have agreed with the multitude who
1409,BOOK I.,"hailed his entrance with smiles and whispers, but with the"
1410,BOOK I.,"intention of doing his duty to his lord, and leaving the event to"
1411,BOOK I.,Heaven. Accordingly
1412,BOOK I.,
1413,BOOK I.,"Firm on his prancing steed, he louted low"
1414,BOOK I.,"In graceful act, and ""Know, Sir King,"" he cried,"
1415,BOOK I.,"""I come to venge thee of thy Pagan foe,"
1416,BOOK I.,"""Knowing that thou such wish hast signified."""
1417,BOOK I.,"As one whose mood was still fastidious; ""Go,"
1418,BOOK I.,"""Go in the name of God;"" King Charles replied:"
1419,BOOK I.,"Then, turning to the lords that hemm'd his seat;"
1420,BOOK I.,"""There lack'd but this to make our shame complete."""
1421,BOOK I.,
1422,BOOK I.,"Astolpho, thus dismissed, pours a volley of abuse upon Grandonio,"
1423,BOOK I.,and tilts at him in fury. The golden lance works an unexpected
1424,BOOK I.,"miracle, and the giant tumbles like a tower that is undermined."
1425,BOOK I.,"King Charlemagne and all are in amazement, while Astolpho, though"
1426,BOOK I.,"no less surprized at his own prowess, pursues his fortune, and"
1427,BOOK I.,"clears the field. These events were immediately recounted to Gan,"
1428,BOOK I.,"who was in his own house, and who, having armed a party of his"
1429,BOOK I.,"kinsmen and retainers, comes before the king, and alleges some"
1430,BOOK I.,"frivolous pretext for his tardy appearance; which, whether"
1431,BOOK I.,"believed or not, is accepted by the sovereign. He now sends a"
1432,BOOK I.,"message to Astolpho, proposing to close the tournament, as the"
1433,BOOK I.,"paynims are defeated. To which the English prince replies, 'that"
1434,BOOK I.,"he considers him every whit as false a Pagan as the others,' and"
1435,BOOK I.,"immediately attacks him with his lance. Gan, Pinabello and all"
1436,BOOK I.,their household are unhorsed; but while Astolpho is in full
1437,BOOK I.,"career, a traitor assails him from behind, and bears him to the"
1438,BOOK I.,"ground. He rises in fury, tilts at friends and foes, and outrages"
1439,BOOK I.,"all, king Charlemagne among the rest; by whose order he is at last"
1440,BOOK I.,"surrounded, mastered, and carried off to prison."
1441,BOOK I.,
1442,BOOK I.,"He was here ill bested, yet not so ill, says the author, as the"
1443,BOOK I.,"other three, who suffered the pains of love for Angelica. These"

1503,BOOK I.,
1504,BOOK I.,"She thirsts, and lightly leaping from her steed,"

1513,BOOK I.,"Enamoured of the slumbering knight, she hesitates long between"
1514,BOOK I.,"love and shame, but, at length, no longer mistress of herself,"
1515,BOOK I.,"pulls a handful of flowers, and flings them in his face. The"
1516,BOOK I.,"gallantry is lost upon Rinaldo; who wakes, and flies from her with"
1517,BOOK I.,"loathing. She pursues, and entreats his compassion in vain; and,"
1518,BOOK I.,"at length, wearied with the chace, sinks down upon the turf, and"
1519,BOOK I.,"weeps herself asleep. Ferrau now arrives in the forest, in the"
1520,BOOK I.,"hope of finding Angelica, or wreaking his vengeance upon her"
1521,BOOK I.,"brother. Occupied with these thoughts he lights upon Argalia; who,"
1522,BOOK I.,"having followed his sister, had dismounted, and was also sleeping"
1523,BOOK I.,"under a tree. Ferrau unties the sleeper's horse, and drives him"
1524,BOOK I.,into the thicket. His adversary's means of escape thus
1525,BOOK I.,"intercepted, he watches till the sleeping man should wake; nor is"
1526,BOOK I.,"his patience put to a long trial. Argalia soon opens his eyes, and"
1527,BOOK I.,"is in great distress at finding his horse gone; but Ferrau, who is"
1528,BOOK I.,"as quickly on his feet, tells him not to think of his loss; as one"
1529,BOOK I.,"of them must not quit the place alive, and his own horse will"
1530,BOOK I.,remain the prize of the survivor.
1531,BOOK I.,
1532,BOOK I.,"The two warriors now again engage in battle, and closing, Ferrau,"
1533,BOOK I.,"through a chink in his armour, strikes Argalia to the heart."
1534,BOOK I.,"Argalia sinks beneath the blow, and dying entreats his adversary"
1535,BOOK I.,"to have regard to his honor, and cast him and his armour into the"
1536,BOOK I.,river; that his memory may not be disgraced by the knowledge of
1537,BOOK I.,"his having been vanquished in enchanted arms. Ferrau, who"
1538,BOOK I.,"compassionates his fate, promises compliance, with the reservation"
1539,BOOK I.,of wearing his helmet till he can provide himself with another.
1540,BOOK I.,"Argalia consents by a sign, and soon after expires."
1541,BOOK I.,
1542,BOOK I.,"Ferrau, who had waited by him till he drew his last sigh, now puts"
1543,BOOK I.,"on the helmet, which he had previously taken from his wounded"
1544,BOOK I.,adversary's head in order to give him air; and having razed off
1545,BOOK I.,"the crest, places it upon his own. He then, with the dead body"
1546,BOOK I.,"under his arm, having remounted his horse, proceeds sadly towards"
1547,BOOK I.,"the neighbouring river, into which he casts Argalia, all armed as"
1548,BOOK I.,"he was, conformably to his dying request. He then pursues his"
1549,BOOK I.,melancholy way through the wood.
1550,BOOK I.,
1551,BOOK I.,"This while Orlando had arrived on this theatre of adventures, and"
1552,BOOK I.,"comes suddenly upon Angelica, who is described as sleeping in act"
1553,BOOK I.,"so exquisitely graceful, that he gazes on the vision in stupid"
1554,BOOK I.,"wonderment, and, at last, to contemplate her more closely, throws"
1555,BOOK I.,himself down by her side.
1556,BOOK I.,
1557,BOOK I.,"Ferrau arrives at this juncture, and supposing Orlando, whom he"
1558,BOOK I.,"had not recognized, to be Angelica's guard, insults and defies"
1559,BOOK I.,"him. The paladin starts up and declares himself; when Ferrau,"
1560,BOOK I.,"though somewhat surprized, making a virtue of necessity, stands to"
1561,BOOK I.,his arms. A desperate duel follows: during this Angelica wakes and
1562,BOOK I.,"flies: Orlando proposes a truce to his adversary, that he may"
1563,BOOK I.,"follow her; but Ferrau, whose courage was now up, tells him she"
1564,BOOK I.,"shall be the prize of the conqueror, and refuses. The battle is"
1565,BOOK I.,therefore renewed with more fury than before. The author here
1566,BOOK I.,exclaims:—
1567,BOOK I.,
1568,BOOK I.,"Gifted with odd half lights, I often wonder"
1569,BOOK I.,How I should think of love; if well or ill.
1570,BOOK I.,"For whether 'tis a thing above, or under"
1571,BOOK I.,"The rule of reason, foils my little skill;"
1572,BOOK I.,"If we go guided by some god, or blunder"
1573,BOOK I.,"Into the snare, which warps our better will;"
1574,BOOK I.,If we by line and rule our actions measure.
1575,BOOK I.,And 'tis a thing we take or leave at pleasure.
1576,BOOK I.,
1577,BOOK I.,"When we behold two bulls each other tear,"
1578,BOOK I.,"A cow the cause of strife, with mutual wound,"
1579,BOOK I.,It looks as if such foolish fury were
1580,BOOK I.,In nature and controlling instinct found:
1581,BOOK I.,"But when we see that absence, prudence, care"
1582,BOOK I.,"And occupation, can preserve us sound"
1583,BOOK I.,"From such a charm, or, if you will, infection;"
1584,BOOK I.,Love seems to be the fruit of pure election.
1585,BOOK I.,
1586,BOOK I.,"Of this so many men have sung and told,"
1587,BOOK I.,"In Hebrew, Latin, and in heathen Greek,"
1588,BOOK I.,"In Egypt, Athens, and in Rome, of old,"
1589,BOOK I.,"Who govern'd by such different judgments speak,"
1590,BOOK I.,That I can ill decide with whom to hold.
1591,BOOK I.,And cannot waste my time the truth to seek.
1592,BOOK I.,"Let it suffice, that Love's a wayward god:"
1593,BOOK I.,And so heav'n keep us from the tyrant's rod!
1594,BOOK I.,
1595,BOOK I.,The truth of these reflections the author considers as strikingly
1596,BOOK I.,"exemplified by the combat between the champions, which is"
1597,BOOK I.,interrupted by the appearance of a strange damsel upon a panting
1598,BOOK I.,"palfrey, who clamours eagerly for Ferrau. She, perceiving him,"
1599,BOOK I.,entreats Orlando to forbear his blows; which he immediately does
1600,BOOK I.,"upon the damsel's request. Addressing herself to the paynim, she"
1601,BOOK I.,"informs him that she is his relation Flordespina, and dispatched"
1602,BOOK I.,"in search of him, to say that Gradasso king of Sericane, a fiend"
1603,BOOK I.,"incarnate, has invaded the Spanish dominions; that king Falsiron"
1604,BOOK I.,"is taken, Valencia ravaged, Arragon destroyed, and Barcelona"
1605,BOOK I.,besieged; that poor Marsilius is broken down by so many
1606,BOOK I.,"calamities, and that his last, hopes rest on him, in pursuit of"
1607,BOOK I.,whom she was wandering. Ferrau balances for a moment between love
1608,BOOK I.,"and duty, but at length determines to suspend his combat, with the"
1609,BOOK I.,"permission of Orlando, who agrees to the proposal, and who himself"
1610,BOOK I.,"follows Angelica. Ferrau, on the other hand, departs with"
1611,BOOK I.,Flordespina for Spain. The author here leaves each to pursue his
1612,BOOK I.,"separate quest, and returns to Charles. This monarch calls a"
1613,BOOK I.,"council in consequence of intelligence received, which was similar"
1614,BOOK I.,to that brought by Flordespina to Ferrau. He observes in this
1615,BOOK I.,"council, that Marsilius is his neighbour and relation, and is yet"
1616,BOOK I.,more entitled to succour from a consideration of common danger;
1617,BOOK I.,"and in consequence, with the consent of his peers, dispatches"
1618,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo with a great charge of men at arms against Gradasso, who"
1619,BOOK I.,had crossed the streights of Gibraltar into Spain. He at the same
1620,BOOK I.,"time constitutes Rinaldo lieutenant of his southern provinces, who"
1621,BOOK I.,departs for the seat of war; and all the knights present at the
1622,BOOK I.,"tournament assemble under his banner. His coming, as well as that"
1623,BOOK I.,"of Ferrau, (now arrived) is highly gratifying to Marsilius, who"
1624,BOOK I.,had sheltered himself in Gerona. The greatest part of Spain (as
1625,BOOK I.,"stated) had been already sacked, and all the Spanish warriors"
1626,BOOK I.,(with the exception of Ferrau) who had returned to the defence of
1627,BOOK I.,"their country, were killed, or prisoners. Even the giant-king,"
1628,BOOK I.,"Grandonio, who we lately saw braving Charlemagne and all his"
1629,BOOK I.,"peerage, had sought refuge in Barcelona. Marsilius, on the arrival"
1630,BOOK I.,"of the French succours, now marches to his relief. The banners of"
1631,BOOK I.,"the allied army are no sooner distinguished by Gradasso, where he"
1632,BOOK I.,"lay camped, and served by giant-kings, than he issues extravagant"
1633,BOOK I.,orders to his various vassals. Four of these he dispatches with
1634,BOOK I.,"their followers against Barcelona, with orders not leave a soul"
1635,BOOK I.,"alive in that city, with the exception of Grandonio, whom he"
1636,BOOK I.,"wishes (as he says) to take alive, that he may bait him with his"
1637,BOOK I.,"dogs. Others are sent forth, with orders to take or destroy the"
1638,BOOK I.,most distinguished amongst the captains of the confederates. This
1639,BOOK I.,"last command is given to Faraldo, king of Arabia, who is enjoined"
1640,BOOK I.,"to bring him Rinaldo and the banner of Charlemagne, which, it"
1641,BOOK I.,"seems, was also one of the principal objects of his expedition."
1642,BOOK I.,
1643,BOOK I.,"The battle now rages in the field, and within the city of"
1644,BOOK I.,"Barcelona, in which the army of Gradasso had previously made"
1645,BOOK I.,"lodgements. While the warfare within the town is still doubtful,"
1646,BOOK I.,"the bands dispatched against the confederates under Rinaldo, are,"
1647,BOOK I.,"after a long contest, defeated; and one of the surviving giant-kings"
1648,BOOK I.,"reports their discomfiture to Gradasso, who immediately arms"
1649,BOOK I.,and goes forth against the conquerors. His first object of attack
1650,BOOK I.,"is Rinaldo; but Bayardo, startled by the appearance of the Alfana,"
1651,BOOK I.,"a monstrous mare, on which Gradasso rode, made a leap of twenty"
1652,BOOK I.,"feet into the air, and thus evaded the charge. Gradasso, though"
1653,BOOK I.,"somewhat surprized, gallops on, and unhorses many of the best"
1654,BOOK I.,"amongst the confederates, who are immediately taken and bound by"
1655,BOOK I.,"Alfrera, one of his giant-kings, who serves him as a lacquey."
1656,BOOK I.,
1657,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo now wheels Bayardo round, and spurs him at Gradasso; and"
1658,BOOK I.,"both charge with such fury, that the Alfana and Bayardo crumble"
1659,BOOK I.,"under their riders, who, however, preserve their seats. Gradasso,"
1660,BOOK I.,"who first recollects himself, gives immediate orders to Alfrera,"
1661,BOOK I.,"who was following him upon a camelopard, to secure Rinaldo and his"
1662,BOOK I.,"horse; and according to his practice, himself follows up the"
1663,BOOK I.,pursuit of the confederates.
1664,BOOK I.,
1665,BOOK I.,"Alfrera has, however, a more difficult task assigned him than"
1666,BOOK I.,"Gradasso had imagined; for Bayardo, having regained his feet,"
1667,BOOK I.,"bears away his rider, who was not yet himself. The paladin,"
1668,BOOK I.,"however, waking from his short stupor, rides again in chase of"
1669,BOOK I.,"Gradasso, himself pursued in vain by the giant Alfrera."
1670,BOOK I.,
1671,BOOK I.,Rinaldo charges Gradasso just as he has unhorsed his brother
1672,BOOK I.,"Alardo, and discharges a furious stroke upon his head. Gradasso"
1673,BOOK I.,"repays the greeting in a way that would have ended the strife, but"
1674,BOOK I.,"for Mambrino's helmet, which saved the knight from any worse evil"
1675,BOOK I.,than a concussion of the brain; while Bayardo again galloped away
1676,BOOK I.,with him in a state of half stupefaction. Recovering himself a
1677,BOOK I.,"second time, and full of shame and fury, he returns to seek"
1678,BOOK I.,"Gradasso, and the combat is renewed with more equality than was"
1679,BOOK I.,"promised by its commencement; Rinaldo, counterbalancing the"
1680,BOOK I.,"strength of his opposite, by his own superior dexterity, and the"
1681,BOOK I.,"quickness and docility of Bayardo. The combatants are, however,"
1682,BOOK I.,"separated, and borne asunder by the tide of battle. After"
1683,BOOK I.,"different adventures, they yet again meet, when Gradasso observing"
1684,BOOK I.,"that Rinaldo is surrounded by the troops of Sericane, courteously"
1685,BOOK I.,proposes that their duel should be deferred till the succeeding
1686,BOOK I.,"day, to be fought under the following conditions, by both"
1687,BOOK I.,"combatants on foot: ""If Rinaldo conquers, he is to have back all"
1688,BOOK I.,"the prisoners made by Gradasso; and if Gradasso wins the day, he"
1689,BOOK I.,is to have Bayardo for his prize; but is in either case to return
1690,BOOK I.,"home, and never more set foot in Europe."" Rinaldo willingly"
1691,BOOK I.,"accedes to this, and a place is fixed on, near the sea, for the"
1692,BOOK I.,"combat, to which both are to come, with no other than defensive"
1693,BOOK I.,"armour and their swords. But the author, while the barriers are"
1694,BOOK I.,"preparing, returns to Angelica, who, being returned to India,"
1695,BOOK I.,"determines on setting Malagigi at liberty, and making him her"
1696,BOOK I.,mediator with the disdainful knight. She accordingly frees him
1697,BOOK I.,"from his dungeon, unlocks his fetters with her own hand, and bids"
1698,BOOK I.,"him in return to unloosen her own. She then returns him his book,"
1699,BOOK I.,"explains herself more precisely, and promises him final liberty,"
1700,BOOK I.,on condition of his bringing back Rinaldo.
1701,BOOK I.,
1702,BOOK I.,"Malagigi calls up a demon with the aid of his book, mounts him and"
1703,BOOK I.,"departs. He is entertained, during his journey, with a relation of"
1704,BOOK I.,"Gradasso's enterprise, by the devil; who told him, as the author"
1705,BOOK I.,"observes, ""all that had chanced, and indeed more, which was so"
1706,BOOK I.,"much the easier, in that he lied."" Malagigi arrived at his"
1707,BOOK I.,"destination, finds Rinaldo rejoiced to see him, but immoveable on"
1708,BOOK I.,"the subject of Angelica; and hence, after many fruitless"
1709,BOOK I.,"endeavours, vanishes with a threat. Having reached a spot"
1710,BOOK I.,"convenient for his incantations, he opens his book, calls up a"
1711,BOOK I.,"legion of demons, and from these, selects Draghinazzo and"
1712,BOOK I.,Falsetta. The latter is bid to take the appearance of one of king
1713,BOOK I.,"Marsilius's heralds, the coat of arms and battoon; and thus"
1714,BOOK I.,"equipped, to inform Gradasso that Rinaldo expects to meet him at"
1715,BOOK I.,"mid-day. Gradasso accepts the invitation, and gifts the false"
1716,BOOK I.,herald with a cup.
1717,BOOK I.,
1718,BOOK I.,"The same devil, again transformed, comes now to Rinaldo, as if"
1719,BOOK I.,"from Gradasso, but with a very different appearance. He has a"
1720,BOOK I.,"turban on his head, wears a flowing robe, and has rings in his"
1721,BOOK I.,"ears, instead of on his fingers. His object is to remind Rinaldo,"
1722,BOOK I.,"on the part of Gradasso, to meet him in the morning, which had"
1723,BOOK I.,"been the time previously stipulated. Thus each, on the supposed"
1724,BOOK I.,"invitation of the other, prepares for a different appointment.—"
1725,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo necessarily is first at the place, but sees nothing but a"
1726,BOOK I.,
1727,BOOK I.,Small pinnace anchor'd by the shore.
1728,BOOK I.,
1729,BOOK I.,"He, however, immediately after, descries a figure on the beach, in"
1730,BOOK I.,"the garb and guise of Gradasso, but which was, in reality, no"
1731,BOOK I.,"other than one of the fiends, Draghinazzo, evoked by Malagigi, and"
1732,BOOK I.,"thus transmogrified. The combat immediately begins; and Rinaldo,"
1733,BOOK I.,"after some blows given and taken, making a desperate two-handed"
1734,BOOK I.,"stroke at the supposed Gradasso, buries his sword Fusberta in the"
1735,BOOK I.,"sand. The devil avails himself of the opportunity to escape, flies"
1736,BOOK I.,"to the boat, and is putting off. Rinaldo, however, follows him"
1737,BOOK I.,"into his barque, and deals a blow at him, but the demon leaps from"
1738,BOOK I.,prow to poop:
1739,BOOK I.,
1740,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo chas'd him back from poop to prow,"
1741,BOOK I.,The sword Fusberta flaming in his hand;
1742,BOOK I.,"But he from side to side, from stern to bow,"
1743,BOOK I.,"Flits, while the barque is drifting from the land."
1744,BOOK I.,Rinaldo marks it not; who thought but how
1745,BOOK I.,To reach the foe with his avenging brand;
1746,BOOK I.,Nor from his long day-dream of vengeance woke.
1747,BOOK I.,Till the false fiend was melted into smoke.
1748,BOOK I.,
1749,BOOK I.,"Yet the paladin will not give over his hopes of finding him, and"
1750,BOOK I.,"renews a fruitless search above and below. In the meantime, the"
1751,BOOK I.,"barque is seven miles from shore, and Rinaldo observes, too late,"
1752,BOOK I.,"that she is scudding, self-steered, before the wind."
1753,BOOK I.,
1754,BOOK I.,"The vessel at length takes the ground near a beautiful garden, and"
1755,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo lands in front of a palace, worthy of its grounds.—Here,"
1756,BOOK I.,"says the author, I leave him, with less compunction, as he is in"
1757,BOOK I.,"good quarters, and proceed in pursuit of Orlando, who, having"
1758,BOOK I.,"wandered as far as the Tanais, in search of Angelica, meets an old"
1759,BOOK I.,"man weeping the loss of his son, who had been taken prisoner by a"
1760,BOOK I.,"giant. The paladin delivers the youth, and the old man, in"
1761,BOOK I.,"gratitude, presents him with a book, which is capable (he says) of"
1762,BOOK I.,resolving the questions of any one who consults it. Instructed by
1763,BOOK I.,"this book, he seeks a sphynx, who appears to have been a yet"
1764,BOOK I.,"better resolver of doubts, in order to obtain information of the"
1765,BOOK I.,"dwelling-place of Angelica. The monster tells him, that this is in"
1766,BOOK I.,Albracca of Catay. In the meantime the sphinx has her question for
1767,BOOK I.,"the interrogator, which it is death not to interpret; and plies"
1768,BOOK I.,"Orlando with the riddle, solved by Œdipus. Orlando, with intent to"
1769,BOOK I.,"cut the knot which he cannot untie, draws Durindana, attacks the"
1770,BOOK I.,"monster sword in hand, and at length slays and tumbles her from"
1771,BOOK I.,the rock on which she made her abode. He has now leisure to look
1772,BOOK I.,in his book for the solution of the sphynx's enigma; and finds
1773,BOOK I.,"that her question of ""What animal begins his career upon four"
1774,BOOK I.,"legs, after a time continues it on two, and ends it upon three?"""
1775,BOOK I.,"means Man; designating thus the child who crawls, the man who"
1776,BOOK I.,"walks, and the old man who supports himself with a stick. Having"
1777,BOOK I.,"cleared up this point, he pursues his way still poring upon the"
1778,BOOK I.,"book, and soon arrives at a river dark, deep, and dangerous, whose"
1779,BOOK I.,precipitous banks afford no means of passage. Orlando rides along
1780,BOOK I.,"the shore till he comes to a bridge, where he dismounts. This is"
1781,BOOK I.,"kept by a giant, who tells him that _he_ who arrives at that"
1782,BOOK I.,"bridge, which is justly named the Bridge of Death, has little"
1783,BOOK I.,while to live; for that all the roads which lead from it wind back
1784,BOOK I.,"to that fatal water, into which either he or Orlando must soon be"
1785,BOOK I.,"plunged never to rise again. Orlando, however, who seems little"
1786,BOOK I.,"impressed by this warning, springs upon the bridge, and attacks"
1787,BOOK I.,"him. A desperate combat now ensues, but with the usual issue. The"
1788,BOOK I.,"giant is slain. He, however, in falling, springs a clap-net of"
1789,BOOK I.,"iron, which closing on the paladin, beats his sword out of his"
1790,BOOK I.,"hand, and envelopes him in its folds."
1791,BOOK I.,
1792,BOOK I.,"As he lies helpless in this trap, a friar arrives, who, after vain"
1793,BOOK I.,"attempts to release him, offers him spiritual consolation, which"
1794,BOOK I.,"is ill received: but the friar, having the sinner at his mercy,"
1795,BOOK I.,continues to inculcate it; and in illustration of the powers of a
1796,BOOK I.,protecting Providence informs him of a late miraculous escape of
1797,BOOK I.,"his own. He was travelling with certain of his brothers, when they"
1798,BOOK I.,"were surprised by a horrible Cyclops, who made a feast on one of"
1799,BOOK I.,"his companions, but cast him from a rock, as worthless carrion;"
1800,BOOK I.,"when he luckily lighted amongst the branches of a tree, where he"
1801,BOOK I.,"lay concealed till evening, and then effected his escape. He is"
1802,BOOK I.,"yet engaged in his narration, when he breaks off with a scream and"
1803,BOOK I.,flies.
1804,BOOK I.,
1805,BOOK I.,His sudden terror was produced by the sight of the very Cyclops of
1806,BOOK I.,"whom he spoke, who came armed with a club and three darts. He,"
1807,BOOK I.,"however, instead of pursuing the friar, stops to consider Orlando."
1808,BOOK I.,"He then takes up Durindana, which lies near, and hews the chain-net"
1809,BOOK I.,"in pieces, without injury to the count, whose skin was"
1810,BOOK I.,"enchanted. Orlando instantly starts up, his bones aching with the"
1811,BOOK I.,"blows, which had not been able to penetrate his flesh; and seizing"
1812,BOOK I.,"the giant's club, they, having thus exchanged weapons, engage in a"
1813,BOOK I.,desperate and equal combat. For if Orlando's skin was
1814,BOOK I.,"invulnerable, the giant's armour, which was made of griffins'"
1815,BOOK I.,"claws, was equally impenetrable. At length Orlando bethinks him of"
1816,BOOK I.,"the three shafts, which the giant had laid down, as well as his"
1817,BOOK I.,"club, when he possessed himself of Durindana."
1818,BOOK I.,
1819,BOOK I.,"Seizing these, and launching one of them at his single eye, it"
1820,BOOK I.,penetrates his brain and stretches him dead. At this juncture the
1821,BOOK I.,"friar, who yet trembles with fear as well as joy, reappears, and"
1822,BOOK I.,"entreats Orlando to accompany him towards the dead cyclops' den,"
1823,BOOK I.,for the purpose of liberating his companions.
1824,BOOK I.,
1825,BOOK I.,"This done, Orlando rides on; when, arriving at a place where many"
1826,BOOK I.,"roads cross, he meets a courier, and asking him news, learns that"
1827,BOOK I.,"he is dispatched by Angelica, to solicit the aid of Sacripant,"
1828,BOOK I.,"king of Circassia, in favour of her father, Galaphron, besieged by"
1829,BOOK I.,"Agrican, emperor of Tartary, in Albracca. This Agrican had been an"
1830,BOOK I.,"unsuccessful suitor to the damsel, whom he now pursues with arms."
1831,BOOK I.,"Orlando, who learns that he is within a day's journey of Albracca,"
1832,BOOK I.,"now thinks that he is secure of Angelica, and proceeds with"
1833,BOOK I.,rapture towards her seat.
1834,BOOK I.,
1835,BOOK I.,"Thus journeying, he arrives at a bridge which united two"
1836,BOOK I.,"mountains, and under which ran a foaming river. Here a damsel"
1837,BOOK I.,"meets him with a goblet, and informs him, with much grace of"
1838,BOOK I.,"demeanor, that it is the usage of the bridge to present the"
1839,BOOK I.,"traveller with a cup, which she offers to Orlando, and which the"
1840,BOOK I.,"paladin, in courtesy, drains. He has, however, no sooner swallowed"
1841,BOOK I.,"the julep which sparkles in it, than his brain dances, and he is"
1842,BOOK I.,"no longer conscious of the object of his journey, or even of his"
1843,BOOK I.,"own existence. Under the influence of this fascination, he follows"
1844,BOOK I.,the damsel into a magnificent and marvellous palace.
1845,BOOK I.,
1846,BOOK I.,"Here the author leaves the count to return to Gradasso, who,"
1847,BOOK I.,deceived by the false herald that appointed him to meet Rinaldo
1848,BOOK I.,"upon the sea-shore at noon, in vain expects his arrival. He waits"
1849,BOOK I.,"there till night, when he retires full of indignation at the"
1850,BOOK I.,"supposed cowardice of his opponent. In the meantime, Ricciardetto"
1851,BOOK I.,"(who had been left by his brother, Rinaldo, in charge of"
1852,BOOK I.,"Charlemagne's army), on the paladin's departure for the false"
1853,BOOK I.,"appointment according to the instructions he had received, in case"
1854,BOOK I.,"of his not returning in a given time, withdraws Charles's forces"
1855,BOOK I.,"from Marsilius's camp, and returns to France."
1856,BOOK I.,
1857,BOOK I.,"Gano immediately cries out upon Rinaldo's treason, and all is"
1858,BOOK I.,"dismay. On the other part, Marsilius, thus deserted, has no means"
1859,BOOK I.,"of safety, but in making peace with Gradasso, and consenting to"
1860,BOOK I.,"hold Spain as his liegeman. In consequence of his so doing,"
1861,BOOK I.,"Gradasso, strengthened by the accession of Marsilius, with"
1862,BOOK I.,"Grandonio and his other vassal kings, marches upon Paris."
1863,BOOK I.,"Charlemagne, with all his peerage, sallies to encounter him; but"
1864,BOOK I.,"his army experiences a disastrous rout, and he, with almost all"
1865,BOOK I.,"his paladins, is captured; while Paris is immediately invested by"
1866,BOOK I.,the invaders.
1867,BOOK I.,
1868,BOOK I.,"Gradasso, however, does not abuse his victory: he takes Charles by"
1869,BOOK I.,"the hand, seats him by his side, and tells him he wars only for"
1870,BOOK I.,"honour. Hence he renounces all conquests, but insists on the"
1871,BOOK I.,"monarch promising him Bayardo and Durindana, both the property of"
1872,BOOK I.,"his vassals, the first of which, as he maintained, was already"
1873,BOOK I.,forfeited by the treason of Rinaldo. To this; Charlemagne and his
1874,BOOK I.,"peers in acknowledgment of their defeat, were to remain his"
1875,BOOK I.,"prisoners for a day: Bayardo, who had been brought back by"
1876,BOOK I.,"Ricciardetto, was to be forthwith delivered up, and Durindana"
1877,BOOK I.,"consigned to Gradasso in Sericana, upon the return of Orlando to"
1878,BOOK I.,"France. To these terms Charlemagne readily accedes, and sends for"
1879,BOOK I.,the horse to Paris.
1880,BOOK I.,
1881,BOOK I.,"Here, Astolpho had assumed the command, having obtained his"
1882,BOOK I.,"freedom during the confusion, which followed upon the rout of"
1883,BOOK I.,"Charlemagne's army, and asserted an authority which, in the"
1884,BOOK I.,"absence of the other peers, there was no one to dispute."
1885,BOOK I.,
1886,BOOK I.,He receives with great indignation the messenger dispatched for
1887,BOOK I.,"Bayardo, and throws him into prison; answering the embassy by a"
1888,BOOK I.,"herald, who says, on the part of Astolpho, ""that Charles has no"
1889,BOOK I.,right in the steed; but that Gradasso may come and fight for him;
1890,BOOK I.,"in which case he will meet him in the field."""
1891,BOOK I.,
1892,BOOK I.,"The next day the two knights encounter, having previously"
1893,BOOK I.,established the conditions of their combat. The enchanted lance
1894,BOOK I.,"performs a new wonder; and Gradasso, the terrible Gradasso, is"
1895,BOOK I.,unhorsed.
1896,BOOK I.,
1897,BOOK I.,"According to their previous agreement, Gradasso is to give up his"
1898,BOOK I.,"prisoners, and return to his kingdom of Sericana. Astolpho,"
1899,BOOK I.,"however, begs him not to spoil a jest which he wishes to put upon"
1900,BOOK I.,"Charlemagne and his paladins, by making them believe that the"
1901,BOOK I.,"issue of the duel had been different from what it was, and that"
1902,BOOK I.,"they, therefore, (in consequence of the first proffer of Gradasso"
1903,BOOK I.,"not having been acceded to,) were still the prisoners of that"
1904,BOOK I.,"sovereign. When Astolpho has sufficiently bantered both king,"
1905,BOOK I.,"count, and bishop (for Turpin was amongst the captives, and one of"
1906,BOOK I.,"the objects of his raillery), he falls upon his knees, begs pardon"
1907,BOOK I.,"of Charles for his irreverence, and observes, that as he is ill"
1908,BOOK I.,"looked upon in his court, he will leave the field to Gano, and set"
1909,BOOK I.,out on the morrow in search of his cousins Orlando and Rinaldo.
1910,BOOK I.,"Having said this, Charles and his peers are freed, and Gano is"
1911,BOOK I.,"getting into his saddle; when he is brought back by Astolpho, who"
1912,BOOK I.,"observes, that he only gives him his liberty, (since the disposal"
1913,BOOK I.,"of all is at his option,) on condition of his swearing before"
1914,BOOK I.,"Charles, to constitute himself his prisoner for four days,"
1915,BOOK I.,whenever he should enjoin it. Charles undertakes for his
1916,BOOK I.,"compliance with such a requisition, and seeks to detain Astolpho"
1917,BOOK I.,"with the bribe of Ireland; but the duke is inflexible, and"
1918,BOOK I.,departs. Gradasso also returns into Sericana.
1919,BOOK I.,
1920,BOOK I.,"The author now returns to Rinaldo, who was landed by the self-piloted"
1921,BOOK I.,"boat in what was, it seems, denominated _The Joyous"
1922,BOOK I.,"Garden_. He is scarcely disembarked, before a lady appears, who"
1923,BOOK I.,"takes him by the hand, and conducts him into a palace, where he is"
1924,BOOK I.,"served by attendant damsels, with every sort of luxury and"
1925,BOOK I.,"magnificence. At last, the chief of the servants tells him, that"
1926,BOOK I.,"all this is his which he surveys, being the present of a lady,"
1927,BOOK I.,"who, to have his love, has brought him out of Spain. While Rinaldo"
1928,BOOK I.,"stands lost in astonishment, the name of Angelica, who is"
1929,BOOK I.,"proclaimed by this man to be the mistress of the palace, breaks"
1930,BOOK I.,"the charm, and he flies in fury through the garden, till, arriving"
1931,BOOK I.,"at the landing-place, he leaps again into his pinnace. The bark,"
1932,BOOK I.,"however, remains immoveable, and he is about to cast himself into"
1933,BOOK I.,"the sea in despair, when it darts from the shore and traverses the"
1934,BOOK I.,waves.
1935,BOOK I.,
1936,BOOK I.,"Arrived on the banks of a well-wooded country, it again takes the"
1937,BOOK I.,"land; and Rinaldo disembarking, encounters a hoary and aged man"
1938,BOOK I.,"upon the beach, who has a melancholy story for the paladin, of a"
1939,BOOK I.,ravisher who had that moment carried away his daughter. Pursuing
1940,BOOK I.,"the thief, Rinaldo falls into a pit-fall, and is carried away"
1941,BOOK I.,"prisoner by a giant; who bears him to a castle, situated upon a"
1942,BOOK I.,"promontory, the walls of which were covered with maimed bodies and"
1943,BOOK I.,"heads, some of which yet quivered with the remains of life."
1944,BOOK I.,
1945,BOOK I.,"The giant, entering the building, casts Rinaldo down before an old"
1946,BOOK I.,woman of stern and forbidding appearance; who thus addresses him:
1947,BOOK I.,—
1948,BOOK I.,
1949,BOOK I.,"""Haply, Sir Knight, thou hast not heard display"
1950,BOOK I.,"""Our castle's use,"" exclaims the beldame old;"
1951,BOOK I.,"""In the short time thou hast to live,—a day"
1952,BOOK I.,"""Is yet thine own,—the story shall be told:"
1953,BOOK I.,"""Then listen to the legend, whilst thou may,"
1954,BOOK I.,"""And I the melancholy tale unfold."
1955,BOOK I.,"""Thou in that space may'st hear the tale of sorrow,"
1956,BOOK I.,"""And witness to its truth in blood to-morrow."""
1957,BOOK I.,
1958,BOOK I.,"She pursues her story* thus: ""Know, Sir Stranger, that this castle"
1959,BOOK I.,"was formerly held by a rich lord, famous for his magnificence and"
1960,BOOK I.,"hospitality, and yet more so, for the incomparable beauty of the"
1961,BOOK I.,"lady whom he had to wife. This castellan was hight Gryphon, his"
1962,BOOK I.,"castle Altaripa, and Stella was the name of his wife. It was his"
1963,BOOK I.,favourite pleasure to disport himself in the green-wood near the
1964,BOOK I.,"shore, where thou arrived'st this morning, and roving one day"
1965,BOOK I.,"through this, he heard the hunting-horn of a stranger, whom he"
1966,BOOK I.,"invited to his castle. The guest was Marchino, lord of Aronda, and"
1967,BOOK I.,"my husband; who was so smitten by the beauty of Stella, that he"
1968,BOOK I.,"could not rest till he had made her his own. He, however,"
1969,BOOK I.,"dissembled his evil intentions, and took a friendly leave of his"
1970,BOOK I.,"entertainer. This was only to return, as a treacherous enemy. He,"
1971,BOOK I.,"accordingly, bearing some resemblance to Gryphon, counterfeited"
1972,BOOK I.,"his ensigns, and came back with a party of his retainers, whom he"
1973,BOOK I.,"concealed, as well as those, in the neighbouring wood. He, in the"
1974,BOOK I.,"mean time, pursued the chace unarmed. Gryphon again sought him"
1975,BOOK I.,"out, and finding him apparently distressed by the loss of a hound,"
1976,BOOK I.,"joined him in his search. He was thus decoyed into the ambuscade,"
1977,BOOK I.,"and assassinated. Marchino, having disposed of his rival, entered"
1978,BOOK I.,"Altaripa under the disguise of Gryphon's ensigns, where he did not"
1979,BOOK I.,"leave a soul alive, with the exception of Stella. She, while"
1980,BOOK I.,"preserved by the conqueror, brooded in secret over schemes of"
1981,BOOK I.,"vengeance, and after pondering some time, determined to have"
1982,BOOK I.,"recourse to that animal whose wrath is the most intolerable,"
1983,BOOK I.,"namely, the wife who has been once loved, and after slighted for"
1984,BOOK I.,"another. This was no other than myself, and the cruelties which I"
1985,BOOK I.,"perpetrated, well justified her expectation. Two children, whom I"
1986,BOOK I.,"had by Marchino, I killed and quartered.—Think upon this: yet"
1987,BOOK I.,know that I still triumph in the recollection of my vengeance.
1988,BOOK I.,"Their heads only, I preserved: the remainder I cooked, and served"
1989,BOOK I.,"up to the wretched father for his supper. This done, I departed"
1990,BOOK I.,"secretly for the court of the king of Orgagna, who had long been a"
1991,BOOK I.,"wooer to me, without success. Him I stirred up to vengeance"
1992,BOOK I.,"against Marchino, and brought in arms against his newly-acquired"
1993,BOOK I.,castle of Altaripa.
1994,BOOK I.,
1995,BOOK I.,"* I have thought it the duty of a translator, to preserve this"
1996,BOOK I.,"story; but I would say to my readers, in the words of Ariosto,—"
1997,BOOK I.,
1998,BOOK I.,"Lasciate questo canto, che senz' esso"
1999,BOOK I.,"Può star l'istoria, e non sarà men' chiara."
2000,BOOK I.,"Mettendolo Turpino, anch' io l'ho messo."
2001,BOOK I.,
2002,BOOK I.,Leave out this canto; since the tale will tell
2003,BOOK I.,"Without it, and the story is as clear:"
2004,BOOK I.,"Which, told by Turpin, I relate as well."
2005,BOOK I.,
2006,BOOK I.,"While I was gone on this errand, Stella, with dishevelled hair, a"
2007,BOOK I.,"smile upon her lips, but bitterness in her heart, presented"
2008,BOOK I.,"herself before the murderer of her husband, with the heads of his"
2009,BOOK I.,"two children in a charger, and disclosed to him the horrid"
2010,BOOK I.,"tragedy, at which he had been an unwitting assistant. The traitor"
2011,BOOK I.,"hesitated for a moment, as if suspended between the desire of lust"
2012,BOOK I.,"and vengeance, and then slew the lady, and satiated both; nay, as"
2013,BOOK I.,"if in outrage of God and man, pursued his impious loves with the"
2014,BOOK I.,"body, till I returned with the king of Orgagna."
2015,BOOK I.,
2016,BOOK I.,"After a desperate resistance, we possessed ourselves of Altaripa,"
2017,BOOK I.,"and Marchino, having been made prisoner, perished in such tortures"
2018,BOOK I.,as he had deserved.
2019,BOOK I.,
2020,BOOK I.,"The king of Orgagna now departed, leaving me mistress of the"
2021,BOOK I.,"conquered castle, with three giants for my defence, having first"
2022,BOOK I.,"buried the unfortunate Stella, together with the body of Gryphon,"
2023,BOOK I.,which had been left exposed and subjected to outrage by the
2024,BOOK I.,barbarous Marchino.
2025,BOOK I.,
2026,BOOK I.,More than eight months had now passed when a horrid cry was heard
2027,BOOK I.,"from the marble sepulchre, in which Gryphon and Stella were laid,"
2028,BOOK I.,"and we fled in dismay from the sound. Only one of my giants, more"
2029,BOOK I.,"daring than his fellows, approached the tomb, and lifted the lid;"
2030,BOOK I.,"when a monster thrust forth its claw, and having dragged him into"
2031,BOOK I.,"the grave, devoured him alive. We immediately walled up the space"
2032,BOOK I.,"about the monument, as a protection against its attacks, and the"
2033,BOOK I.,"monster, having made its way out of the sepulchre, remains thus"
2034,BOOK I.,enclosed between the defences which we have constructed. But such
2035,BOOK I.,"is his rage and craving for human flesh, that we supply him with"
2036,BOOK I.,"this, lest he should tear down the wall in his fury. Hence the"
2037,BOOK I.,"usage of this castle; which is to seize on all strangers, in order"
2038,BOOK I.,to provide him with food. The quarters which you see exposed on
2039,BOOK I.,"the walls, are the leavings of the beast: for though the custom"
2040,BOOK I.,"sprung out of necessity, my heart is become hardened with cruelty,"
2041,BOOK I.,"and I now live for no other pleasure."""
2042,BOOK I.,
2043,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo hears the hag with stern composure, and desires no other"
2044,BOOK I.,"favour than that of being exposed to the monster, clad in armour,"
2045,BOOK I.,"as he is, and with Fusberta in his hand. This the beldam grants,"
2046,BOOK I.,"with a bitter smile of mockery, and the night closes upon him in"
2047,BOOK I.,his dungeon.
2048,BOOK I.,
2049,BOOK I.,"The succeeding morning, he is lowered down from the wall into the"
2050,BOOK I.,"space tenanted by the beast, the horrible fruit of Marchino's"
2051,BOOK I.,intercourse with the body of Stella. A desperate combat now
2052,BOOK I.,"ensues, Rinaldo being unable to make any impression on the scales"
2053,BOOK I.,"of the monster: while he, on the contrary, shears away plate and"
2054,BOOK I.,mail from the paladin. While he is engaged in this hopeless
2055,BOOK I.,"struggle, the beast seizes Fusberta with his teeth, and disarms"
2056,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo, who is left without defence."
2057,BOOK I.,
2058,BOOK I.,"The author here leaves him, as he says, to speak of a spirit"
2059,BOOK I.,"hardly less afflicted, though in another manner: he means"
2060,BOOK I.,"Angelica; who expects in trembling, the effect of Malagigi's"
2061,BOOK I.,"attempt. He arrives, and states his failure, but would comfort the"
2062,BOOK I.,damsel with the thoughts of vengeance; relating to what a perilous
2063,BOOK I.,pass he had brought the miserable Rinaldo; for it was by his
2064,BOOK I.,"stratagem that he was conveyed to Altaripa. She, however, is in"
2065,BOOK I.,"despair at his danger, and overwhelms Malagigi with repoaches. He"
2066,BOOK I.,"tells her, it is not yet too late to save him, and furnishes her"
2067,BOOK I.,"with the means. These are a rope, with a noose at the distance of"
2068,BOOK I.,"every palm, a cake of wax, and a file. Furnished with these"
2069,BOOK I.,"implements, and instructed by Malagigi in the use of them,"
2070,BOOK I.,Angelica flies through the air to the succour of Rinaldo.
2071,BOOK I.,
2072,BOOK I.,"The miserable paladin had, in the mean time, sprang upon a beam,"
2073,BOOK I.,"which projected from the wall, and thus remained hanging between"
2074,BOOK I.,"heaven and earth, with little hope even of present safety; since"
2075,BOOK I.,"the monster continually leapt at him, and, often, all but reached"
2076,BOOK I.,"him with his claws. It was now evening, when Rinaldo was surprised"
2077,BOOK I.,"by the shadow of a woman, and soon after by the sight of Angelica,"
2078,BOOK I.,"kneeling before him, self-suspended in air. She reproaches herself"
2079,BOOK I.,"for having brought him into this peril, and opening her arms,"
2080,BOOK I.,"entreats him to take refuge in them, and escape. Such, however,"
2081,BOOK I.,"are the effects of the fountain of hate, that Rinaldo spurns at"
2082,BOOK I.,"the proposal, and vows if she does not immediately depart, he will"
2083,BOOK I.,cast himself down from the beam. After long and fruitless efforts
2084,BOOK I.,"to move him, she at length descends, throws her cake of wax to the"
2085,BOOK I.,"monster, and immediately flings her rope, knotted with nooses,"
2086,BOOK I.,"before him. The beast, who takes the bait, finding his teeth glued"
2087,BOOK I.,"together by the wax, vents his fury in bounds, and leaping into"
2088,BOOK I.,"one of the snares is noosed by Angelica, who leaves him thus"
2089,BOOK I.,"entangled, and departs."
2090,BOOK I.,
2091,BOOK I.,"Though the monster is delivered over to him gagged and bound, so"
2092,BOOK I.,"invulnerable is his hide, that Rinaldo makes long and fruitless"
2093,BOOK I.,"efforts to destroy him; till, at length, leaping upon his neck, he"
2094,BOOK I.,squeezes his eyes out of their sockets; and the beast expires
2095,BOOK I.,under the gripe.
2096,BOOK I.,
2097,BOOK I.,Another difficulty yet remained to be overcome. The walls were of
2098,BOOK I.,"immense height, and the only opening in them was a grated window,"
2099,BOOK I.,of such strength that Fusberta was unable to separate the bars. In
2100,BOOK I.,"his distress, however, Rinaldo perceived the file which had been"
2101,BOOK I.,"left by Angelica on the ground, and, with the help of this,"
2102,BOOK I.,effected his deliverance.
2103,BOOK I.,
2104,BOOK I.,"He is immediately discovered and surrounded, but he charges and"
2105,BOOK I.,"slays his pursuers; and the beldam, having witnessed the"
2106,BOOK I.,"destruction of her followers, throws herself headlong from a"
2107,BOOK I.,balcony of three hundred feet in height.
2108,BOOK I.,
2109,BOOK I.,"Departing hence, Rinaldo returns to the seaside; but, unwilling to"
2110,BOOK I.,"trust himself again to the bark, pursues his way along the shore."
2111,BOOK I.,
2112,BOOK I.,"The author now returns to Astolpho, who had set out in search of"
2113,BOOK I.,"his cousins, Orlando and Rinaldo, splendidly dressed and equipt,"
2114,BOOK I.,"as was his use, and mounted on Bayardo; in the intention of"
2115,BOOK I.,"returning him to his lord. Having arrived in Circassia, he finds"
2116,BOOK I.,"there a great army, encamped under the command of Sacripant, the"
2117,BOOK I.,king of that country; who was leading it to the defence of
2118,BOOK I.,"Galaphron, the father of Angelica. Astolpho visits the camp of"
2119,BOOK I.,"this faithful, but ill-requited lover of the princess; and not"
2120,BOOK I.,"having the leopard on his buckler, which was of gold, is known"
2121,BOOK I.,through the Circassian army as the knight of the golden shield.
2122,BOOK I.,"Sacripant, much struck by the appearance of Astolpho and his"
2123,BOOK I.,"horse, accosts him affably, and"
2124,BOOK I.,
2125,BOOK I.,"Demands how his assistance may be bought,"
2126,BOOK I.,"And bids him make his price of service known,"
2127,BOOK I.,"""—With gift of this fair host, whom thou hast brought"
2128,BOOK I.,"""To war in Indian fields from tower and town;"""
2129,BOOK I.,"The British duke replies, ""With this, or nought.—"
2130,BOOK I.,"""Leave me, or make me at this price thine own."
2131,BOOK I.,"""Nor will I serve, sir king, for other pay,"
2132,BOOK I.,"""Born to command, unweeting to obey."""
2133,BOOK I.,
2134,BOOK I.,"This, with other more extravagant speeches, leads the Circassian"
2135,BOOK I.,"captains to consider him as a madman, and Astolpho is left to"
2136,BOOK I.,"pursue his journey. King Sacripant, however, has been too much"
2137,BOOK I.,"struck with the appearance of his horse and armour, to part with"
2138,BOOK I.,"him so easily, and having divested himself of his kingly"
2139,BOOK I.,"ornaments, he determines to pursue him."
2140,BOOK I.,
2141,BOOK I.,Astolpho was in the meantime advanced a day's journey upon his
2142,BOOK I.,"road, when he was overtaken by a strange warrior:"
2143,BOOK I.,
2144,BOOK I.,"The stranger knight was named sir Brandimart,"
2145,BOOK I.,Lord of the Sylvan Tower and its domain:
2146,BOOK I.,"Through paynim countries, and in every part"
2147,BOOK I.,"Bruited for glorious feats, by hill and plain."
2148,BOOK I.,Well versed in tilt and tourney's valiant art;
2149,BOOK I.,In his appearance graceful and humane:
2150,BOOK I.,"Courteous, with that: and over and above"
2151,BOOK I.,"His other virtues, famed for constant love."
2152,BOOK I.,
2153,BOOK I.,"A gentle damsel had the knight for guide,"
2154,BOOK I.,Who with Astolpho bold encountered there;
2155,BOOK I.,Blooming in early youth and beauty's pride;
2156,BOOK I.,And in his faithful eyes as dear as fair.
2157,BOOK I.,Him from afar the British duke* defied.
2158,BOOK I.,And proudly bade him for the joust prepare
2159,BOOK I.,"And wheel and take his ground, and guard his right,"
2160,BOOK I.,"""Or leave his lady love, a prize to better knight."""
2161,BOOK I.,
2162,BOOK I.,* Astolpho.
2163,BOOK I.,
2164,BOOK I.,"Brandimart is as ready for battle as Astolpho; but observes, as"
2165,BOOK I.,"the latter has no lady, he may wager his horse; as it was but fair"
2166,BOOK I.,"that each should deposit his stake. The proposal is acceded to,"
2167,BOOK I.,"and the knights encounter. Brandimart is unhorsed, and his steed"
2168,BOOK I.,"falls dead, while Bayardo remains uninjured by the shock."
2169,BOOK I.,
2170,BOOK I.,"The paynim knight observing the disconsolate looks of the damsel,"
2171,BOOK I.,"is so overwhelmed with despair, that he draws his sword and is"
2172,BOOK I.,"about to plunge it into his own bosom. Astolpho, however, holds"
2173,BOOK I.,"his hand, and exclaims that he contended but for glory, and having"
2174,BOOK I.,"won the honours of the fight, was contented to leave him the lady."
2175,BOOK I.,
2176,BOOK I.,"While Brandimart is vowing eternal service and gratitude, king"
2177,BOOK I.,"Sacripant arrives, and now longing for the damsel of the one as"
2178,BOOK I.,"well as the steed and arms of the other, defies them to the joust."
2179,BOOK I.,"Astolpho, as mounted, meets the challenger, whom he instantly"
2180,BOOK I.,"overthrows, and presents Brandimart with his courser; leaving the"
2181,BOOK I.,king to return to his army on foot. This disposition is scarcely
2182,BOOK I.,"made, when Brandimart's damsel changes colour, and tells them they"
2183,BOOK I.,"are approaching the waters of Oblivion, and advises them either to"
2184,BOOK I.,"turn back, or to change their direction. Both refuse; and pursuing"
2185,BOOK I.,"their path, arrive at the bridge where Orlando was left."
2186,BOOK I.,
2187,BOOK I.,"The damsel, as before, appears with the enchanted chalice, which"
2188,BOOK I.,is rejected by Astolpho with contumely. She immediately dashes it
2189,BOOK I.,"to the ground, and a fire blazes up, which renders the bridge"
2190,BOOK I.,"impassable. Upon this the damsel, who accompanied them, seizes"
2191,BOOK I.,"each by the hand, runs with them along the river, and brings them"
2192,BOOK I.,"to another secret and narrow bridge, which they cross in safety,"
2193,BOOK I.,and find themselves beside the enchanted garden.
2194,BOOK I.,
2195,BOOK I.,"Brandimart instantly batters down the gate, and the two warriors"
2196,BOOK I.,"entering, are attacked by sundry knights known and unknown, who,"
2197,BOOK I.,"having, no recollection of any thing, join blindly in the defence"
2198,BOOK I.,"of their prison-house. While these are engaged by Brandimart,"
2199,BOOK I.,"Astolpho entering the garden and pursuing his career, meets with"
2200,BOOK I.,"Orlando, who being, like the rest, mindless of kindred or of"

2202,BOOK I.,"activity of Bayardo. He clears the wall, and bears off his rider."
2203,BOOK I.,
2204,BOOK I.,The author pauses to tell us that the enchanted water signifies
2205,BOOK I.,"the affection, impression, or opinion which man takes from others,"
2206,BOOK I.,"either at sight, or upon trust; and the cup, which the damsel lets"
2207,BOOK I.,"fall, is that which gives its colouring to the thing seen."

2209,BOOK I.,"Bayardo, this time, continues to gain upon Orlando's horse; and"
2210,BOOK I.,"while Astolpho is thus born out of danger, Brandimart is overlaid"
2211,BOOK I.,"with fearful odds in the enchanted garden; and his lady, trembling"
2212,BOOK I.,"for the issue of the battle, entreats him to yield to necessity,"
2213,BOOK I.,"and comply with the usage of the fairy. So saying, she flies; and"

2221,BOOK I.,"kindly by Angelica, though she is somewhat outraged by his"
2222,BOOK I.,rhodomontades. He is not long before he attempts to put them in
2223,BOOK I.,practice. For having one night ordered the drawbridge to be
2224,BOOK I.,"lowered, he sallies out alone, arrives in Agrican's camp, and"
2225,BOOK I.,"unhorses his warriors, right and left, by means of the enchanted"

2227,BOOK I.,"consternation among the besieged, and the author says that no one"
2228,BOOK I.,dared sally from the city.
2229,BOOK I.,
2230,BOOK I.,"Relief, was, however at hand; for, as the burghers and soldiers,"
2231,BOOK I.,"are one day, leaning over their walls, they descry a cloud of"
2232,BOOK I.,"dust, from which horsemen are seen to prick forth, as it rolls on"
2233,BOOK I.,"towards the camp of the besiegers, which lay between the town and"
2234,BOOK I.,the new army that was approaching.
2235,BOOK I.,
2236,BOOK I.,"This turns out to be the army of Sacripant, which, arriving the"
2237,BOOK I.,"morning after the capture of Astolpho, attacks that of Agrican,"
2238,BOOK I.,with the view of cutting a passage through his camp into the
2239,BOOK I.,"besieged city. Agrican, however, mounted on Bayardo, taken from"
2240,BOOK I.,"Astolpho, but not armed with the lance of gold, with the virtues"
2241,BOOK I.,"of which he appears to have been unacquainted, performs prodigies,"
2242,BOOK I.,"and rallies his scattered troops, which had given way to the"
2243,BOOK I.,"sudden and unexpected assault. Sacripant, on the other hand,"
2244,BOOK I.,"encourages his own by the most desperate acts of valour, and, as"
2245,BOOK I.,"an additional incentive to his courage, sends a messenger to"
2246,BOOK I.,"Angelica, entreating that she will appear upon the walls. She not"
2247,BOOK I.,"only complies with this invitation, but sends him a sword as an"
2248,BOOK I.,earnest of her favour.
2249,BOOK I.,
2250,BOOK I.,She arrives in time to see a single combat between the two
2251,BOOK I.,"leaders, Agrican and Sacripant: in this, however, her defender"
2252,BOOK I.,"appears to be rather overmatched, when the Circassians break the"
2253,BOOK I.,"ring, and separate the two combatants, who are borne asunder by"
2254,BOOK I.,"the crowd. Sacripant, who was severely wounded, profits by the"
2255,BOOK I.,"occasion, and escapes into Albracca, where he is put to bed and"
2256,BOOK I.,carefully attended.

2261,BOOK I.,"Angelica orders the drawbridge to be lowered, and the gates to be"
2262,BOOK I.,"thrown open to the fugitives. With these Agrican, who was not"
2263,BOOK I.,"distinguished in the hurly-burly, enters the place pell mell,"
2264,BOOK I.,"driving both Circassians and Catayans before him, and the"

2270,BOOK I.,"learning the cause, leaps from bed, naked and wounded as he was,"
2271,BOOK I.,"and armed only with his sword and shield, opposes himself to his"
2272,BOOK I.,fury. His example and his reproaches take effect. Her allies the
2273,BOOK I.,"flyers, and, fresh forces coming to his assistance, and pouring in"

2280,BOOK I.,"questioned as to the cause of her sorrow, tells him she wanders"
2281,BOOK I.,"upon a hopeless quest, and is in search of one who will do battle"
2282,BOOK I.,"with nine knights, amongst whom is Orlando. This is the lady loved"
2283,BOOK I.,"of Brandimart; to whom Rinaldo promises his assistance, trusting"
2284,BOOK I.,to accomplish the adventure either by valour or by skill. The
2285,BOOK I.,"author here pauses from his narrative, and exclaims,"
2286,BOOK I.,
2287,BOOK I.,To the grim winter and the dismal night
2288,BOOK I.,Succeed the balmy spring and cheerful day.
2289,BOOK I.,"That battle had so fill'd me with affright,"

2295,BOOK I.,
2296,BOOK I.,"The damsel, on their setting out together on the adventure,"
2297,BOOK I.,"insists upon Rinaldo's taking her horse. This he refuses, and a"
2298,BOOK I.,"contest of courtesy follows, which is ended by Rinaldo's accepting"
2299,BOOK I.,"the palfrey, on condition of her mounting upon the croup. This she"
2300,BOOK I.,"does, in some fear for her honour; but finding the cavalier cold"
2301,BOOK I.,"and silent, at last proposes to beguile the way with a story. To"
2302,BOOK I.,"this he consents, and she begins her narration as follows:"
2303,BOOK I.,
2304,BOOK I.,"""There lived of late, in Babylon, a cavalier, called Iroldo, who"
2305,BOOK I.,"had for his wife a lady named Tisbina, to whom he was passionately"
2306,BOOK I.,"attached. Near them dwelt a Babylonian gentleman, named Prasildo,"
2307,BOOK I.,"rich, gay, courteous and valiant; who, making one of a party of"
2308,BOOK I.,"both sexes, in a garden, where a game was played which admitted"
2309,BOOK I.,"familiarities between them, fell desperately in love with Tisbina,"
2310,BOOK I.,"whom he vainly solicited, by every kind of gallantry and"
2311,BOOK I.,magnificence.
2312,BOOK I.,
2313,BOOK I.,"""All his efforts were however unavailing; and, disappointed in his"
2314,BOOK I.,"hope, he fell into a state of melancholy which rendered life"
2315,BOOK I.,intolerable. One only occupation seemed to afford him some little
2316,BOOK I.,"relief. This was to brood over his sorrows in a wood, situated at"
2317,BOOK I.,a small distance from Babylon.
2318,BOOK I.,
2319,BOOK I.,"""As he here one day indulged his grief (and it grew by"
2320,BOOK I.,"indulgence,) he fell into such a fit of passion, that he"
2321,BOOK I.,"determined, after a broken soliloquy, to slay himself and die with"
2322,BOOK I.,"the name of Tisbina on his lips. By a strange accident, his"
2323,BOOK I.,"intention was overheard by Iroldo and Tisbina herself, who were"
2324,BOOK I.,walking together in the wood. They were both moved to compassion;
2325,BOOK I.,and Iroldo insisted upon Tisbina's offering some consolation to
2326,BOOK I.,the despairing lover.
2327,BOOK I.,
2328,BOOK I.,"""Her husband leaving her, that she may execute this purpose, she"
2329,BOOK I.,"comes upon him as if by accident; pretends that, though modesty"
2330,BOOK I.,"has hitherto restrained her, she has not been insensible to his"
2331,BOOK I.,"tenderness; and assures him, that, if he will give her an"
2332,BOOK I.,"indubitable proof of his devotion, in undertaking an adventure"
2333,BOOK I.,"which she has at heart, she will reward him with the possession of"
2334,BOOK I.,her person.
2335,BOOK I.,
2336,BOOK I.,"""She then tells him that beyond the woods of Barbary, there is a"
2337,BOOK I.,"garden, which is surrounded by an iron wall, to be entered through"
2338,BOOK I.,"four gates. These are respectively called the gate of Life, of"
2339,BOOK I.,"Death, of Riches, and of Poverty."
2340,BOOK I.,
2341,BOOK I.,"""In the centre (she said) was a tree, whose top was an arrow's"
2342,BOOK I.,"flight from the ground, with leaves of emerald, and golden fruit."
2343,BOOK I.,"Of this tree she required a branch, and again renewed her"
2344,BOOK I.,assurance of the price which she would pay for the acquisition.
2345,BOOK I.,"Prasildo joyfully promised it, and would have promised sun, moon,"
2346,BOOK I.,"and stars, as easily as the achievement of the adventure; upon"
2347,BOOK I.,which he immediately departs.
2348,BOOK I.,
2349,BOOK I.,"""The lady, it appears, dispatched him to the garden of Medusa*,"
2350,BOOK I.,"for so it was called, that he might find a cure for his love in"
2351,BOOK I.,"absence and in travel: or, if he reached the spot, might find"
2352,BOOK I.,there a yet surer remedy for his distemper. For the sight of
2353,BOOK I.,"Medusa, who was to be found standing under the wonderful tree,"
2354,BOOK I.,"occasioned every one to forget the errand he came on, and, if he"
2355,BOOK I.,"had any speech with the dame, his very name and self."
2356,BOOK I.,
2357,BOOK I.,"* Designed, I suppose, as the type of conscience; as one ""whose"
2358,BOOK I.,"sight would make him forget the errand on which he came,"" &c."
2359,BOOK I.,
2360,BOOK I.,"""Prasildo, departing on this forlorn enterprise, traversed Egypt,"
2361,BOOK I.,"and arriving near the mountains of Barca, encounters an old man,"
2362,BOOK I.,to whom he relates the object of his expedition.
2363,BOOK I.,
2364,BOOK I.,"""The old man assures him that fortune could not have directed him"
2365,BOOK I.,"to a better counsellor, and immediately furnishes him with his"
2366,BOOK I.,instructions.
2367,BOOK I.,
2368,BOOK I.,"""He begins by telling him that the gates of Life and of Death are"
2369,BOOK I.,never used as entrances to the enchanted enclosure; and that it is
2370,BOOK I.,only through the gate of Poverty that man can penetrate into the
2371,BOOK I.,garden of Medusa. He next informs him that Medusa herself guards
2372,BOOK I.,the marvellous tree; whose appearance deprives whoever sets eyes
2373,BOOK I.,on her of his memory; but that she is to be terrified into flight
2374,BOOK I.,by the reflection of her own face.
2375,BOOK I.,
2376,BOOK I.,"""He therefore counsels Prasildo to provide himself with a shield"
2377,BOOK I.,"of looking-glass, being in other respects naked; for such"
2378,BOOK I.,appearance is a fitting guise for entering the gate of Poverty.
2379,BOOK I.,This (he observes) is the most terrible and the most severely
2380,BOOK I.,"guarded of all, being watched by Misery and Shame, Cold, Hunger,"
2381,BOOK I.,"Melancholy, and Scorn. ""There,"" said he, ""is to be seen Roguery"
2382,BOOK I.,"stretched upon the ground, and covered with itch, and (in strange"
2383,BOOK I.,"union,) Industry and Laziness, Compassion and Desperation."
2384,BOOK I.,
2385,BOOK I.,"""Having succeeded in the enterprise, and torn off a branch of the"
2386,BOOK I.,"tree, you will seek the opposite gate,"" he pursues, ""by which you"
2387,BOOK I.,"are to retreat; and will there find Wealth seated, and on the"
2388,BOOK I.,watch. Here you are to make an offering of a portion of the
2389,BOOK I.,"branch, that Avarice, who plays the porter, may open to you"
2390,BOOK I.,"quickly; a wretch who asks the more, the more you give. Here, too,"
2391,BOOK I.,"you will see Pomp and Honour, Flattery and Hospitality, Ambition,"
2392,BOOK I.,"Grandeur, and Favour: then Inquietude and Torment, Jealousy,"
2393,BOOK I.,"Suspicion, Fear, Solicitude, and Terror. Behind the door stand"
2394,BOOK I.,"Hate, and Envy with a bow for ever bent."""
2395,BOOK I.,
2396,BOOK I.,"""Prasildo having received his full instructions, now crosses the"
2397,BOOK I.,"desert, and, after thirty days' journey, arrives at the garden."
2398,BOOK I.,"Here he easily passes the gate of Poverty, the entry of which no"
2399,BOOK I.,"one defends. On the contrary, there ever stands some one near it,"
2400,BOOK I.,to encourage and invite.
2401,BOOK I.,
2402,BOOK I.,"""Having entered the inclosure, he advances, holding his shield of"
2403,BOOK I.,"glass before his eyes; and reaching the tree, against which Medusa"
2404,BOOK I.,"was leaning, the Fairy, who raises her head at his approach, and"
2405,BOOK I.,"beholds herself in the mirror, takes to flight; scared, it seems,"
2406,BOOK I.,by seeing reflected in it the head of a serpent; though in other
2407,BOOK I.,"eyes her beauty is divine.* Prasildo, hearing the Fairy fly,"
2408,BOOK I.,"uncovers his eyes, which were before protected by his shield, and"
2409,BOOK I.,"leaving her to escape, goes directly to the tree, from which he"
2410,BOOK I.,"severs a branch. Then, pursuing the directions received, makes for"
2411,BOOK I.,"the opposite gate, where he sees Wealth, surrounded by her"
2412,BOOK I.,"followers. This gate, which is of load-stone, never opens without"
2413,BOOK I.,"noise, and is for the most part shut: Fatigue and Fraud are the"
2414,BOOK I.,"guides who conduct to it. It is, however, sometimes open; but"
2415,BOOK I.,requires both luck and courage to enable any one to profit by the
2416,BOOK I.,"chance. It was open the day Prasildo came, and he made the"
2417,BOOK I.,"offering of half the bough, as he was instructed, and escaped with"
2418,BOOK I.,the remainder of his prize.
2419,BOOK I.,
2420,BOOK I.,* The circumstance of Medusa not being able to contemplate the
2421,BOOK I.,"reflection of her own hideous appearance, though beautiful in the"
2422,BOOK I.,sight of others; the fact of no one being able to win the golden
2423,BOOK I.,"bough which she kept, but by refraining from looking her in the"
2424,BOOK I.,"face; and other circumstances, confirm the conjecture which I have"
2425,BOOK I.,hazarded in a preceding note.
2426,BOOK I.,
2427,BOOK I.,"""Transported with pleasure, he issues from the garden, passes"
2428,BOOK I.,"through Nubia, crosses the Arabian Gulf with a fair wind, and"
2429,BOOK I.,journeys day and night till he arrives in Babylon.
2430,BOOK I.,
2431,BOOK I.,"""Arrived there, he sends immediate news of his success to Tisbina,"
2432,BOOK I.,who is in an agony at learning the unexpected result of her
2433,BOOK I.,"device. Iroldo is rendered equally miserable, but insists upon the"
2434,BOOK I.,"necessity of her redeeming her promise, though he knows he cannot"
2435,BOOK I.,survive its execution. She feels that she can as ill survive
2436,BOOK I.,"Iroldo; and they at last resolve, that faith must be kept with"
2437,BOOK I.,"Prasildo, and that they will both die. They accordingly send to an"
2438,BOOK I.,"aged apothecary for a deadly draught, which they divide between"
2439,BOOK I.,"them; and each having swallowed a due portion, Iroldo covers his"
2440,BOOK I.,"face and throws himself on his bed, while the yet more miserable"
2441,BOOK I.,Tisbina proceeds to the residence of Prasildo. Here she attempts
2442,BOOK I.,"to dissemble her sorrow and to feign a cheerfulness, foreign to"
2443,BOOK I.,"her heart. But Prasildo detects the imposture, and at last extorts"
2444,BOOK I.,"a full confession of the truth. This declared, he reproaches her,"
2445,BOOK I.,"as having little faith in his generosity, with a bursting heart"
2446,BOOK I.,"renounces the proffered happiness, and dismisses her with an"
2447,BOOK I.,affectionate kiss.
2448,BOOK I.,
2449,BOOK I.,"""Tisbina, who had assured him that if she had known him first, she"
2450,BOOK I.,"should have loved him as devotedly as she did her husband, now"
2451,BOOK I.,"departs, overflowing with gratitude, and returns to Iroldo who was"
2452,BOOK I.,"still unaffected by the draught, but prostrate on the bed. She"
2453,BOOK I.,relates to him the sacrifice of her lover. The husband springs
2454,BOOK I.,"from his couch, thanks God for this last mercy, and invokes every"
2455,BOOK I.,"blessing upon the head of Prasildo. While he is yet praying, he"
2456,BOOK I.,"sees the countenance of Tisbina change, who sinks, as if overcome"
2457,BOOK I.,"by sleep. The husband sees the operation of the drink with horror,"
2458,BOOK I.,and is transported from his short fit of pleasure to a state of
2459,BOOK I.,the most agonizing despair.
2460,BOOK I.,
2461,BOOK I.,"""The situation of Prasildo is scarcely less intolerable; who"
2462,BOOK I.,"locked himself up in his chamber, in order to indulge his grief in"
2463,BOOK I.,"solitude, upon the departure of Tisbina. While he is shut up in"
2464,BOOK I.,"darkness, the ancient apothecary calls, and tells his valet that"
2465,BOOK I.,Prasildo's life depends upon his immediate admission to him. The
2466,BOOK I.,"valet was a native of Casazzo, of a merry humour and full of faith"
2467,BOOK I.,"and attachment, diligent, active, and experienced in all his"
2468,BOOK I.,duties; but of a frankness which sometimes gave his master
2469,BOOK I.,"offence. This man, having a master-key, admits the apothecary; who"
2470,BOOK I.,"excusing the intrusion by his zeal for Prasildo's repose, informs"
2471,BOOK I.,him that he had that morning furnished the chambermaid of Tisbina
2472,BOOK I.,"with a potion, by her mistress's order, which he believed was"
2473,BOOK I.,"destined for his destruction, as Tisbina had been shortly"
2474,BOOK I.,"afterwards traced to his house; but adds, that he need be under no"
2475,BOOK I.,"apprehension, even if he has swallowed the draught: since, in the"
2476,BOOK I.,"apprehension of mischief, he had substituted a mere sleeping-potion,"
2477,BOOK I.,the effects of which were only calculated to last for a
2478,BOOK I.,few hours.
2479,BOOK I.,
2480,BOOK I.,"""Prasildo, transported with joy, immediately flies in search of"
2481,BOOK I.,"Iroldo, whose stronger constitution had as yet resisted the"
2482,BOOK I.,"soporific, and informs him of the joyful tidings of the"
2483,BOOK I.,apothecary. Iroldo receives the news in such a manner as might
2484,BOOK I.,"have been expected, and concludes with making Prasildo a return"
2485,BOOK I.,"such as he had never looked for. In a transport of gratitude, he"
2486,BOOK I.,"insists on his receiving Tisbina, and accordingly departs from"
2487,BOOK I.,"Babylon, leaving her yet asleep. On waking, she is combated by"
2488,BOOK I.,"opposing feelings; but at length, as the generosity of Prasildo"
2489,BOOK I.,"had made more impression on her heart, than she was willing to"
2490,BOOK I.,"confess, even to herself, yields to Iroldo's will, and takes"
2491,BOOK I.,"Prasildo for her husband."""
2492,BOOK I.,
2493,BOOK I.,"The damsel was yet speaking, when a loud cry was heard, which"
2494,BOOK I.,"filled her with consternation. Rinaldo however, re-assuring her as"
2495,BOOK I.,"he best could, pressed forward through the wood (for they were"
2496,BOOK I.,then in the centre of one) towards the quarter from which it
2497,BOOK I.,proceeded.
2498,BOOK I.,
2499,BOOK I.,"He soon perceived a giant standing under a vaulted cavern, with a"
2500,BOOK I.,"large club in his hand, and of an appearance to have struck the"
2501,BOOK I.,boldest spirit with dread. On each side of the cavern was chained
2502,BOOK I.,"a griffin, who, together with the giant, were stationed there for"
2503,BOOK I.,the protection of the horse which was once Argalia's.
2504,BOOK I.,
2505,BOOK I.,This monster of enchantment was the creature.
2506,BOOK I.,"For of a mare, composed of spark and flame,"
2507,BOOK I.,"(Strange wonder, and beyond the laws of nature)"
2508,BOOK I.,"Made pregnant by the wind, the courser came;"
2509,BOOK I.,"Matchless in vigour, speed, and form and feature."
2510,BOOK I.,"Such was his birth, and Rabican his name:"
2511,BOOK I.,"Who, with his fellow-steeds, disdain'd to share"
2512,BOOK I.,"The proffer'd corn or grass, and fed on air."
2513,BOOK I.,
2514,BOOK I.,"This marvellous horse being driven away by Ferrau, in the wood of"
2515,BOOK I.,"Arden, previous to his fatal encounter with Argalia, who had"
2516,BOOK I.,"possessed himself of him by enchantment, on finding himself at"
2517,BOOK I.,"liberty, returned to his native cavern, and was here stabled under"
2518,BOOK I.,the protection of the giant and the griffins. Towards these
2519,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo advances with deliberate valour, over ground whitened with"
2520,BOOK I.,"the bones of their victims. He is the first to smite at the giant,"
2521,BOOK I.,but his stroke is rendered of no effect by the enchanted helmet of
2522,BOOK I.,his adversary. In a second blow he is more fortunate; but his
2523,BOOK I.,"adversary, though wounded near the heart, escapes, and looses his"
2524,BOOK I.,griffins. One of these immediately seizes the giant by a foot:
2525,BOOK I.,"rises with him into the sky, hovers over Rinaldo's head, and at"
2526,BOOK I.,"length drops his burden, with intent to crush the intruder."
2527,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo, however, who was as remarkable for his activity, as for"
2528,BOOK I.,"his strength and courage, shuns the descending mischief, and the"
2529,BOOK I.,"giant falls to the ground crushed, without harm to the paladin. In"
2530,BOOK I.,"the meantime, the other griffin, having towered in air, pounces"
2531,BOOK I.,"upon Rinaldo, who, watching his opportunity, wounds her"
2532,BOOK I.,"desperately in her descent. She has, however, strength enough to"
2533,BOOK I.,"soar a second flight, and swooping upon Rinaldo's helmet, loosens"
2534,BOOK I.,"its circle with her claws; tear it she could not, since this was"
2535,BOOK I.,"the enchanted helmet, which was once the head-piece of Mambrino."
2536,BOOK I.,
2537,BOOK I.,"In this manner the griffin repeats her attacks, and Rinaldo fends"
2538,BOOK I.,"and parries as he can; while the damsel stands trembling near, and"
2539,BOOK I.,witnesses the contest.
2540,BOOK I.,
2541,BOOK I.,"The battle still continued, rendered more terrible by the approach"
2542,BOOK I.,"of night; when Rinaldo, fearing he should not be able to"
2543,BOOK I.,"distinguish his enemy, determined upon a desperate expedient, in"
2544,BOOK I.,"order to bring it to a conclusion. He fell, as if fainting from"
2545,BOOK I.,"his wounds, and on the close approach of the griffin, dealt her a"
2546,BOOK I.,"blow, which sheared away one of her wings. The beast, though"
2547,BOOK I.,"sinking, griped him fast with her talons, digging through plate"
2548,BOOK I.,"and mail: but Rinaldo plied his sword in utter desperation, and at"
2549,BOOK I.,last accomplished her destruction.
2550,BOOK I.,
2551,BOOK I.,The damsel now entreats Rinaldo to mount and proceed; but he
2552,BOOK I.,"thinks the adventure ill accomplished, and proceeds towards the"
2553,BOOK I.,"entrance of the cavern. This was secured by a door,"
2554,BOOK I.,
2555,BOOK I.,Whose marble pannel a mosaic fill'd
2556,BOOK I.,"Of pearl and emerald, sown with care so nice;"
2557,BOOK I.,"That he who saw the piece, if little skill'd,"
2558,BOOK I.,Might deem it was a treasure passing price.
2559,BOOK I.,In the mid-picture lay a damsel kill'd;
2560,BOOK I.,"And, writ in golden letters, the device"
2561,BOOK I.,"This legend bore: ""Let whoso passes, plight"
2562,BOOK I.,"""His word to 'venge my death, and do me right;"
2563,BOOK I.,
2564,BOOK I.,"""Or he shall die the death; but if he swear"
2565,BOOK I.,"""To slay the traitor who my death design'd;"
2566,BOOK I.,"""The enchanted courser shall the warrior bear,"
2567,BOOK I.,"""A courser that is swifter than the wind."""
2568,BOOK I.,The prince stopt not to think; but plighted there
2569,BOOK I.,"In solemn form, his promise, as enjoin'd;"
2570,BOOK I.,"His promise to avenge, alive or dead."
2571,BOOK I.,"The slaughter'd damsel's blood, unjustly shed."
2572,BOOK I.,
2573,BOOK I.,"Then enters, and beholds the courser tied"
2574,BOOK I.,"With chains of gold, so famous for his speed."
2575,BOOK I.,With foot-cloth of white silk he was supplied.
2576,BOOK I.,And all things else convenient for his need.
2577,BOOK I.,"Tho' coal-black all the rest, the tail was pied."
2578,BOOK I.,And starred with white the forehead of the steed;
2579,BOOK I.,And white one foot behind. Bayardo's might
2580,BOOK I.,Was more: but this had pass'd a dart in flight.
2581,BOOK I.,
2582,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo is delighted with his adventure, and, while surveying the"
2583,BOOK I.,"steed, beholds a book, secured by a chain, in which was written in"
2584,BOOK I.,blood the history of the damsel's death.
2585,BOOK I.,
2586,BOOK I.,"The book related that Truffaldino, king of Baldacca, had a count"
2587,BOOK I.,"for his neighbour, distinguished for his virtues and"
2588,BOOK I.,"accomplishments, whom that evil-minded prince misliked on that"
2589,BOOK I.,"very account. His name was Orisello, and Montefalcon was that of"
2590,BOOK I.,the castle where he resided. This lord had a sister as
2591,BOOK I.,"distinguished for her merit, called Albarosa, who loved Polindo, a"
2592,BOOK I.,noble knight of equal virtue and daring. The castle was built upon
2593,BOOK I.,"a rock, and so well fortified, that Truffaldino, who had warred"
2594,BOOK I.,"upon the count, though he had made several assaults upon it, had"
2595,BOOK I.,always been defeated in his attempts.
2596,BOOK I.,
2597,BOOK I.,"Things being in this state, Polindo, who had a great love for"
2598,BOOK I.,"travel, and often wandered from court to court, arrived at that of"
2599,BOOK I.,"Truffaldino; who, for his own evil views, shewed him great favour,"
2600,BOOK I.,"and having acquired his confidence, promised him assistance in his"
2601,BOOK I.,"designs upon Albarosa. As a means of forwarding these, he presents"
2602,BOOK I.,"him with a castle of pleasure, situated a day's journey from"
2603,BOOK I.,Montefalcon; and Polindo having persuaded Albarosa to elope with
2604,BOOK I.,"him, carries her thither; but while they are supping together,"
2605,BOOK I.,"with infinite delight, Truffaldino, who had entered the castle by"
2606,BOOK I.,"a subterraneous passage, unknown to its new possessor, breaks in"
2607,BOOK I.,"upon them with a party of his retainers, and binds them both. He"
2608,BOOK I.,"then dictates a letter to the lady, which he orders her to send to"
2609,BOOK I.,"her brother Orisello, in order to decoy him into his hands. She"
2610,BOOK I.,"refuses; when the tyrant puts her to the torture, in the presence"
2611,BOOK I.,"of Polindo, before whose eyes she expires, refusing compliance"
2612,BOOK I.,with her latest breath.
2613,BOOK I.,
2614,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo, having read this dreadful history, swears anew to avenge"
2615,BOOK I.,"the treason, and, mounted upon Rabican, issues forth from the"
2616,BOOK I.,"cavern. He and the damsel, however, have not ridden far, when the"
2617,BOOK I.,"light fails them in a forest, where they dismount, secure their"
2618,BOOK I.,"horses, and compose themselves to rest."
2619,BOOK I.,
2620,BOOK I.,Beside the maid with zest Rinaldo sleeps;
2621,BOOK I.,"For him, nor time, nor place, nor beauty move."
2622,BOOK I.,"From whence we learn the antidote, which keeps"
2623,BOOK I.,The heart and mind from that which is above
2624,BOOK I.,"All other cure; that he, who sows and reaps,"
2625,BOOK I.,"Or tilts and tourneys, never dies of love:"
2626,BOOK I.,"But in this book I am ill read, nor can"
2627,BOOK I.,"Bolt, as I would, such matters to the bran."
2628,BOOK I.,
2629,BOOK I.,"And now the air on every side grew light,"
2630,BOOK I.,Though the sun shew'd not yet his golden ray;
2631,BOOK I.,"With few and fading stars the sky was dight,"
2632,BOOK I.,And the glad birds rang out their matin lay.
2633,BOOK I.,"Such was the season, neither day nor night;"
2634,BOOK I.,When the maid view'd Rinaldo where he lay;
2635,BOOK I.,"Who from her grassy couch before had crept,"
2636,BOOK I.,And watch'd the weary warrior as he slept.
2637,BOOK I.,
2638,BOOK I.,"Of lively visage, though composed to rest,"
2639,BOOK I.,The lusty knight in early youth appear'd.
2640,BOOK I.,"Light in the flanks, and large across the chest;"
2641,BOOK I.,And on his lip scarce bloom'd the manly beard.
2642,BOOK I.,"On him the damsel gazed with alter'd breast,"
2643,BOOK I.,To her by new-discovered gifts endear'd:
2644,BOOK I.,For slumber ever gives the sleeper's face
2645,BOOK I.,I know not what of loveliness and grace.
2646,BOOK I.,
2647,BOOK I.,"While the damsel is engaged in contemplating the knight, she is"
2648,BOOK I.,"startled by a loud roar, and turning, sees a centaur with a live"
2649,BOOK I.,"lion, which he had just taken, in one hand, and a club and three"
2650,BOOK I.,darts in the other. Rinaldo is at the same time awakened by the
2651,BOOK I.,"sound, and grasping his shield, or rather the remnant of it, which"
2652,BOOK I.,"had been left by the griffin, advances to her assistance."
2653,BOOK I.,
2654,BOOK I.,"The centaur now leaves his prey, and flying to a little distance,"
2655,BOOK I.,"launches his darts at the paladin. These he avoids by his agility,"
2656,BOOK I.,"when the monster returns and charges him with his club. Rinaldo,"
2657,BOOK I.,"thus pressed, shelters himself, by placing his back against a"
2658,BOOK I.,"pine, and maintains the combat with Fusberta. The centaur, who had"
2659,BOOK I.,"at first seemed to have the advantage, in being able to curvet"
2660,BOOK I.,"about the knight, and threaten him behind and before, finding"
2661,BOOK I.,"himself deprived of this double means of annoyance, leaves him,"
2662,BOOK I.,"and gallops after the damsel, who had in the meantime seated"
2663,BOOK I.,"herself upon her palfrey. From this he snatches her in fury,"
2664,BOOK I.,"throws her on his own croup, and flies with her through the"
2665,BOOK I.,forest.
2666,BOOK I.,
2667,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo, who is this while engaged in mounting Rabican, follows;"
2668,BOOK I.,"and, such is the swiftness of his horse, is almost immediately up"
2669,BOOK I.,"with the beast; who, being overtaken on the brink of a rapid"
2670,BOOK I.,"river, casts his burden into the stream, which carries it away."
2671,BOOK I.,Rinaldo and the centaur again join in battle; at first on the
2672,BOOK I.,"shore, and afterwards in the water. The paladin at length slays"
2673,BOOK I.,"his savage opponent: but having slain the monster, is in doubt"
2674,BOOK I.,what course to pursue.
2675,BOOK I.,
2676,BOOK I.,He at last determines to proceed in the adventure in which he had
2677,BOOK I.,"embarked, being especially moved thereto, by the hope of"
2678,BOOK I.,delivering Orlando. Deprived then of the guidance of the poor
2679,BOOK I.,"damsel, he resolves to steer the same northern course in which she"
2680,BOOK I.,had before directed him.
2681,BOOK I.,
2682,BOOK I.,"Here, however, according to the author, Turpin leaves the story to"
2683,BOOK I.,"return to Albracca. Agrican was left there, surrounded and alone,"
2684,BOOK I.,in the midst of his enemies. Whilst he is thus reduced to the last
2685,BOOK I.,"extremities, he is saved by the very circumstance which threatened"
2686,BOOK I.,"him with destruction. The soldiers of Angelica, closing upon him"
2687,BOOK I.,"from all parts, had deserted their defences, and his own besieging"
2688,BOOK I.,"army enter these pell mell, in a part where the wall is"
2689,BOOK I.,accessible.
2690,BOOK I.,
2691,BOOK I.,"In this way was Agrican rescued, the city taken by storm, and the"
2692,BOOK I.,"miserable inhabitants put to the sword. Angelica, however, with"
2693,BOOK I.,"some of the kings who were her defenders, and amongst whom was"
2694,BOOK I.,"Truffaldino, saved herself in the citadel, which was planted upon"
2695,BOOK I.,a rock. Hither also came Sacripant when all beside was lost.
2696,BOOK I.,
2697,BOOK I.,"But though the situation of the fortress rendered it impregnable,"
2698,BOOK I.,it was scantily victualled and ill provided with other necessaries
2699,BOOK I.,"besides food. Under these circumstances, Angelica announced to"
2700,BOOK I.,"those blockaded with her in the citadel, her intention to go in"
2701,BOOK I.,"quest of assistance; and, having plighted her promise to come back"
2702,BOOK I.,"within a certain period, set out, with the enchanted ring upon her"
2703,BOOK I.,finger.
2704,BOOK I.,
2705,BOOK I.,"Mounted on her palfrey, the damsel passed through the enemies'"
2706,BOOK I.,"camp at night, without having occasion to avail herself of the"
2707,BOOK I.,"talisman, and by sun-rise was many miles clear of their"
2708,BOOK I.,encampment.
2709,BOOK I.,
2710,BOOK I.,"She at length arrives near Orgagna in Circassia, and here"
2711,BOOK I.,"encounters an old man weeping bitterly, who entreats her"
2712,BOOK I.,"assistance on behalf of his only son, who is dying of a fever. The"
2713,BOOK I.,"damsel, who was well skilled in medicine, promises succour, turns"
2714,BOOK I.,"her palfrey, and accompanies the elder."
2715,BOOK I.,
2716,BOOK I.,"This old man was a traitor, and his story a fiction, formed for"
2717,BOOK I.,"the purpose of getting her into his hands. He was, it seems,"
2718,BOOK I.,"employed to inveigle and capture damsels for the king of Orgagna,"
2719,BOOK I.,"and for this purpose brought those who followed him to a tower,"
2720,BOOK I.,"built over a river, which served him as a dungeon for his"
2721,BOOK I.,"prisoners. Angelica following him thither, the door closed upon"
2722,BOOK I.,"her, and she found herself a captive with many other dames and"
2723,BOOK I.,"damsels. Amongst these was Flordelis, the lady of Brandimart, who,"
2724,BOOK I.,"when cast into the river by the centaur, had drifted with the"
2725,BOOK I.,"current, and was taken up more dead than alive, by the wicked"
2726,BOOK I.,"elder. She now relates her adventures to Angelica, and tells her"
2727,BOOK I.,"how she was going, accompanied by Rinaldo, to the garden of"
2728,BOOK I.,"Dragontina, where Orlando, Brandimart, and many other valiant"
2729,BOOK I.,knights were enchanted by that fairy.
2730,BOOK I.,
2731,BOOK I.,"Angelica treasures up their history in her mind, as useful to the"
2732,BOOK I.,"purpose which she had in hand, and on the door of the tower"
2733,BOOK I.,"opening, to admit a new victim, slips the ring into her mouth and"
2734,BOOK I.,escapes.
2735,BOOK I.,
2736,BOOK I.,"Being again at liberty, she sets out for the garden of Dragontina,"
2737,BOOK I.,"and, entering it unseen, disenchants Orlando, Brandimart, and the"
2738,BOOK I.,"rest, by a touch of her talisman. These she conjures to assist her"
2739,BOOK I.,"in the recovery of her kingdom, and all depart together for"
2740,BOOK I.,Albracca.
2741,BOOK I.,
2742,BOOK I.,In the meantime a revolution had taken place in the citadel of
2743,BOOK I.,"that metropolis. Truffaldino, always false, had surprised"
2744,BOOK I.,"Sacripant, and the other wounded princes in their beds, and cast"
2745,BOOK I.,"them into prison. This done, he sent a messenger to Agrican, with"
2746,BOOK I.,"an offer to deliver the fortress into his hands. Agrican, however,"
2747,BOOK I.,"received the proposal in a manner little expected by Truffaldino,"
2748,BOOK I.,whom he reviled as a traitor and a coward; declared that he would
2749,BOOK I.,"never be indebted to fraud, for that which he could have by force;"
2750,BOOK I.,"said he knew the extremities of the garrison, which must soon be"
2751,BOOK I.,"his, and declared, that as soon as the place was in his"
2752,BOOK I.,"possession, he would hang up Truffaldino by the heels."
2753,BOOK I.,
2754,BOOK I.,"Soon after this, Orlando, with his friendly squadron of knights"
2755,BOOK I.,"(nine in number), with Angelica in the midst of them, arrives"
2756,BOOK I.,"before Albracca; and charging through the camp of Agrican, arrives"
2757,BOOK I.,"at the foot of the citadel: this is, however, kept against them by"
2758,BOOK I.,"Truffaldino, who appears upon the walls, and declares that he will"
2759,BOOK I.,"only admit Orlando and his followers, on their swearing to protect"
2760,BOOK I.,"him for ever from the vengeance of Sacripant and the others; whom,"
2761,BOOK I.,"for his own safety, he has been under the necessity of casting"
2762,BOOK I.,"into prison. Orlando indignantly refuses; but, conjured by"
2763,BOOK I.,"Angelica, consents; as do the others who accompany him; and after"
2764,BOOK I.,"the oath has been taken as enjoined, the squadron enters the"
2765,BOOK I.,fortress.
2766,BOOK I.,
2767,BOOK I.,"This, however, is found so destitute of food, that a sally is"
2768,BOOK I.,resolved upon for the purpose of provisioning it: it is to be made
2769,BOOK I.,"by Orlando, Brandimart, Adrian, Clarion, and Uberto of the Lion;"
2770,BOOK I.,while Gryphon and Aquilant remain at home for the protection of
2771,BOOK I.,Angelica and the citadel.
2772,BOOK I.,
2773,BOOK I.,Orlando and his friends having made the warder lower his
2774,BOOK I.,"drawbridge, ride boldly towards the enemy's camp; and Agrican,"
2775,BOOK I.,"marking their scanty number, bids his squadrons stand apart, and"
2776,BOOK I.,"leave a fair field for himself and Orlando, who engage in a"
2777,BOOK I.,"desperate duel. While they are employed in this, with little"
2778,BOOK I.,"vantage on either side, and to their mutual astonishment at"
2779,BOOK I.,"finding themselves so equally matched, a loud larum is heard from"
2780,BOOK I.,"the citadel, which announces the arrival of succours."
2781,BOOK I.,
2782,BOOK I.,"This was an army, raised by Galaphron, for the relief of Albracca;"
2783,BOOK I.,the vanguard commanded by a vassal giant; the second body by
2784,BOOK I.,"Marphisa, a young Indian queen, who had made a vow in her infancy,"
2785,BOOK I.,"never to lay aside her armour, till she had taken three kings"
2786,BOOK I.,"prisoners, to wit, Charlemagne, Gradasso, and Agrican; while the"
2787,BOOK I.,"rear-guard was conducted by Galaphron himself. The van-guard, led"
2788,BOOK I.,"by the giant, is immediately engaged with the besiegers; and its"
2789,BOOK I.,"leader, armed with an immense hammer, deals such destruction"
2790,BOOK I.,"amongst their ranks, that all is speedily in confusion and"
2791,BOOK I.,disarray.
2792,BOOK I.,
2793,BOOK I.,"Agrican, witnessing the rout of his followers, now entreats"
2794,BOOK I.,"Orlando, for his lady's love, that their combat may be suspended"
2795,BOOK I.,"till the morrow, in order to give him an opportunity of rallying"
2796,BOOK I.,"the fugitives. This Orlando not only grants, but offers to assist"
2797,BOOK I.,"him in his design. The offer is, however, courteously declined by"
2798,BOOK I.,"Agrican, who, flying in pursuit of the giant, unhorses him, and"
2799,BOOK I.,leaves him desperately wounded to the daggers of his followers. He
2800,BOOK I.,himself charges the troops who come under the giant's conduct; and
2801,BOOK I.,the tide of battle is turned.
2802,BOOK I.,
2803,BOOK I.,No attempt to stop the confusion of the vanguard is made by
2804,BOOK I.,"Marphisa, who this time was retired from the field, and sleeping"
2805,BOOK I.,under a tree.
2806,BOOK I.,
2807,BOOK I.,But first the queen her chamber-wench bespoke.
2808,BOOK I.,"""Attend to my command,"" Marphisa said,"
2809,BOOK I.,"""And when thou seest our Indian army broke,"
2810,BOOK I.,"""And Galaphron, its royal leader, dead,"
2811,BOOK I.,"""When all these things shall be, 'twere time I woke,"
2812,BOOK I.,"""_Then_, bring my steed and rouse me from my bed."
2813,BOOK I.,"""But till these things shall be, such care delay,"
2814,BOOK I.,"""'Tis then this single arm shall change the day."""
2815,BOOK I.,
2816,BOOK I.,"Galaphron now observing the rout of his vanguard, determines to"
2817,BOOK I.,"retrieve things, or perish in the attempt. With this resolution he"
2818,BOOK I.,"spurs towards the enemy; when Angelica, beholding his danger from"
2819,BOOK I.,"the walls, sends a messenger to Orlando, to entreat his assistance"
2820,BOOK I.,for her father; reminding him that he fought beneath her eyes.
2821,BOOK I.,
2822,BOOK I.,"The author here leaves the story suspended, and returns to"
2823,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo; who journeying northward, in the direction which"
2824,BOOK I.,"Flordelis, the damsel of Brandimart, had first given him, arrives"
2825,BOOK I.,at a fountain; where he finds a cavalier weeping upon the ground.
2826,BOOK I.,"Having long observed his grief in silence, he at length dismounts"
2827,BOOK I.,"from his horse, and entreats the sorrowing knight to inform him of"
2828,BOOK I.,its cause.
2829,BOOK I.,
2830,BOOK I.,The stranger tells him that his misery is such as can find no
2831,BOOK I.,remedy but in death: nor does the fear of that oppress him; but
2832,BOOK I.,the knowledge that his death must be followed by that of another.
2833,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo entreats him to explain how this can be, and prevails on"
2834,BOOK I.,him to relate his history at length.
2835,BOOK I.,
2836,BOOK I.,"This the stranger began in the following manner: ""About twenty"
2837,BOOK I.,"days' journey from hence is situated the famous city of Babylon,"
2838,BOOK I.,of which Tisbina was the wonder; a lady alike renowned for her
2839,BOOK I.,"charms and virtues. Of this treasure I became the possessor; yet,"
2840,BOOK I.,"having possessed her, found it my cruel duty to yield her to"
2841,BOOK I.,"another. For two years afterwards I wandered, almost deprived of"
2842,BOOK I.,my reason; but time at last brought with it some alleviation of my
2843,BOOK I.,sorrow. To this common remedy of grief was united the reflection
2844,BOOK I.,that I had resigned her to the most virtuous and most courteous of
2845,BOOK I.,"men; and that, however dear it might cost me, it was impossible to"
2846,BOOK I.,repent my sacrifice.
2847,BOOK I.,
2848,BOOK I.,"""While I was thus wandering, my evil fortune led me into Orgagna,"
2849,BOOK I.,"whose rightful king, Poliphernus, was absent with the army of"
2850,BOOK I.,"Agrican; his kingdom having, during his absence, fallen into the"
2851,BOOK I.,"possession of an evil woman, who makes all strangers her prey."
2852,BOOK I.,"This enchantress (for such she is), whose name is Falerina, has a"
2853,BOOK I.,"beautiful garden, which is only open towards the east; where a"
2854,BOOK I.,"serpent keeps the gate, to whom Falerina gives her unfortunate"
2855,BOOK I.,"prisoners to be devoured. The names of these are paired, a"
2856,BOOK I.,"cavalier and a lady, according to the order of their arrival; and"
2857,BOOK I.,a couple is thus every day offered to the monster.
2858,BOOK I.,
2859,BOOK I.,"""I was amongst the prisoners of Falerina; when tidings of my"
2860,BOOK I.,"imprisonment, for my greater misfortune, reached the ears of"
2861,BOOK I.,"Prasildo, the noble gentleman to whom I had relinquished Tisbina."
2862,BOOK I.,"Unknown to me, he immediately set out for the enchanted garden,"
2863,BOOK I.,"loaded with treasure, with which he attempted to accomplish my"
2864,BOOK I.,"release. All his endeavours, however, were vain; and desperate of"
2865,BOOK I.,"accomplishing it in any other way, he offered himself as a victim"
2866,BOOK I.,in my place. This offer was accepted: I was thrust out of the
2867,BOOK I.,"dungeon, and he remains a prisoner in my stead. This day is that"
2868,BOOK I.,"appointed for his sacrifice, which shall not be consummated,"
2869,BOOK I.,"whilst I am alive: for it is my resolution, when he is led out of"
2870,BOOK I.,"prison to be conducted to the place of punishment, to attack his"
2871,BOOK I.,"guards and perish in his defence. My single source of grief is,"
2872,BOOK I.,that I shall not be able to purchase his deliverance with my
2873,BOOK I.,"life."""
2874,BOOK I.,
2875,BOOK I.,"Rinaldo bids the stranger be of better cheer, and offers to join"
2876,BOOK I.,"him in the attack of Prasildo's guards, to which Iroldo, who"
2877,BOOK I.,"conceives this will be a useless sacrifice of life, very"
2878,BOOK I.,unwillingly accedes.
2879,BOOK I.,
2880,BOOK I.,"The issue of the attempt is, however, very different from what"
2881,BOOK I.,"Iroldo had anticipated. The rabble, who were conducting two"
2882,BOOK I.,"prisoners to the place of execution, are set upon by the knights,"
2883,BOOK I.,and scattered on all sides; principally by the valour of Rinaldo.
2884,BOOK I.,
2885,BOOK I.,"In the male prisoner Iroldo recognizes Prasildo, as he had"
2886,BOOK I.,expected; and the damsel turns out to be Flordelis. Rinaldo is now
2887,BOOK I.,impatient to crown his victory with the destruction of the
2888,BOOK I.,"enchanted garden; but the damsel, his former guide, after vainly"
2889,BOOK I.,seeking to terrify him by a description of the various monsters
2890,BOOK I.,"and enchantments by which it was guarded, reminds him of the"
2891,BOOK I.,"imprisonment of Orlando, and his unaccomplished promise to achieve"
2892,BOOK I.,the destruction of the garden of Dragontina. This consideration
2893,BOOK I.,prevails over his anxiety to demolish that of Falerina; and in
2894,BOOK I.,"company with his two friends and the damsel, who all become"
2895,BOOK I.,Christians in admiration of his prowess and in gratitude for their
2896,BOOK I.,"deliverance, proceeds on his journey towards the garden of"
2897,BOOK I.,Dragontina.
2898,BOOK I.,
2899,BOOK I.,"This however had been previously destroyed and effaced, even to"

2901,BOOK I.,
2902,BOOK I.,"The knights, pursuing their journey towards its former situation,"
2903,BOOK I.,meet on their way a fugitive from Agrican's army; who gives such
2904,BOOK I.,an account of the prowess of a champion who fought upon the part
2905,BOOK I.,"of Angelica, that Rinaldo is persuaded this must have been"
2906,BOOK I.,Orlando; though all are at a loss to imagine how he could have
2907,BOOK I.,"been freed. They had not proceeded much farther, when they saw a"
2908,BOOK I.,"warrior under some trees, to whom a damsel was presenting a horse."
2909,BOOK I.,"This warrior Flordelis recognized by her bearings for Marphisa,"
2910,BOOK I.,"and whom she especially counselled her companions to avoid. They,"
2911,BOOK I.,"however, and more especially Rinaldo, treated the caution with"
2912,BOOK I.,"contempt, and made boldly towards the virago."
2913,BOOK I.,
2914,BOOK I.,"As she is just mounting, to defy them to the joust, she is"
2915,BOOK I.,"approached by an elderly man, all in tears, who relates the"
2916,BOOK I.,"overthrow of Galaphron's vanguard, and entreats her assistance;"
2917,BOOK I.,"which she promises to bestow, as soon as she shall have unhorsed"
2918,BOOK I.,and taken the approaching strangers.
2919,BOOK I.,
2920,BOOK I.,"Advancing against them, she first encounters and overthrows Iroldo"
2921,BOOK I.,"and Prasildo in succession, who are made prisoners by some of"
2922,BOOK I.,"Marphisa's followers, that were in waiting, together with the"
2923,BOOK I.,"attendant damsel. She next meets Rinaldo, and breaks upon him an"
2924,BOOK I.,"enormous lance, which had never yet failed her. Rinaldo too breaks"
2925,BOOK I.,"his upon the damsel, and both, casting away their broken spears,"
2926,BOOK I.,encounter with their swords. Here Rinaldo's dextrous skill in
2927,BOOK I.,"defence, and the superior temper of Fusberta, give him a temporary"
2928,BOOK I.,"advantage; and in parrying a blow of his opponent, he beats the"
2929,BOOK I.,"faulchion out of her hand. Full of fury, the virago deals him a"
2930,BOOK I.,"deadly blow on the face with her gauntletted hand in return, and"
2931,BOOK I.,makes him reel in his saddle; while Rabican wheels round and
2932,BOOK I.,carries off his half-stupefied rider. Marphisa instantly springs
2933,BOOK I.,"to ground and regains her sword, and Rinaldo recovering himself,"
2934,BOOK I.,again spurs his courser to the encounter.
2935,BOOK I.,
2936,BOOK I.,"In the mean time, Orlando, at the command of Angelica, had"
2937,BOOK I.,"galloped to the assistance of Galaphron, at the head of his brave"
2938,BOOK I.,"companions, and had again changed the fortune of the day. He and"
2939,BOOK I.,"Agrican now meet a second time in the medley, and renew the"
2940,BOOK I.,"contest with more fury than before; and Agrican, being at last"
2941,BOOK I.,convinced that it will be impossible for him to effect any thing
2942,BOOK I.,"against Albracca but by the destruction of Orlando, determines to"
2943,BOOK I.,"bring the battle to a desperate issue, and in order to get his"
2944,BOOK I.,adversary into a place where they shall be secure from
2945,BOOK I.,"interruption, feigns to fly; and is followed by Orlando to an open"
2946,BOOK I.,"space in a wood, in the middle of which is a fountain. Here, after"
2947,BOOK I.,"mutual reproaches, they again charge each other with their swords,"
2948,BOOK I.,"and still with doubtful success. Night closes upon the combatants,"
2949,BOOK I.,who have passed the greater part of the day in the interchange of
2950,BOOK I.,blows.
2951,BOOK I.,
2952,BOOK I.,"The two champions again suspend their combat almost of necessity,"
2953,BOOK I.,and agree upon a truce till day-light. They accordingly lie down
2954,BOOK I.,together and engage in a friendly conversation. During this
2955,BOOK I.,Agrican makes out his antagonist to be Orlando; and Orlando seizes
2956,BOOK I.,"the opportunity to attempt his conversion. Agrican, however,"
2957,BOOK I.,"receives the proposal with utter contempt, and observes that love"
2958,BOOK I.,and arms are the only subjects of conversation becoming a knight.
2959,BOOK I.,
2960,BOOK I.,This change of theme almost necessarily leads to the mention of
2961,BOOK I.,"Angelica, and the rivals, being kindled by the discourse which"
2962,BOOK I.,"ensues between them, into new animosity, remount their horses and"
2963,BOOK I.,attack each other in the dark.
2964,BOOK I.,
2965,BOOK I.,"The contest is thus continued with various success, and day breaks"
2966,BOOK I.,"upon this desperate and unheard-of duel. At length, however, the"
2967,BOOK I.,"fortune of Orlando prevails, and he after receiving many desperate"
2968,BOOK I.,"contusions (for wounded he could not be), inflicts a deadly gash"
2969,BOOK I.,in his adversary's side.
2970,BOOK I.,
2971,BOOK I.,"Agrican is now deserted by his lofty spirit, and demands baptism"
2972,BOOK I.,from the hands of Orlando:
2973,BOOK I.,
2974,BOOK I.,"While tears descending bathed his manly face,"
2975,BOOK I.,"The gentle count dismounted to his aid,"
2976,BOOK I.,"Then locked the wounded knight in his embrace,"
2977,BOOK I.,Upon the fountain's grassy border laid:
2978,BOOK I.,"And kiss'd his fading lips, and sought his grace,"
2979,BOOK I.,And of the mischief done forgiveness prayed.
2980,BOOK I.,"The speechless Tartar king his head inclin'd,"
2981,BOOK I.,And with the cross his brows Orlando sign'd.
2982,BOOK I.,
2983,BOOK I.,When having to his sorrow found that he
2984,BOOK I.,"Was breathless, and all vital warmth was fled;"
2985,BOOK I.,"He weened his gallant spirit was set free,"
2986,BOOK I.,And by the crystal fountain left him dead;
2987,BOOK I.,"Clad as he was in armour cap-a-pe,"
2988,BOOK I.,"With sword in hand, and crown upon his head:"
2989,BOOK I.,"Then first towards his courser turn'd his view,"
2990,BOOK I.,And in that steed the good Bayardo knew.
2991,BOOK I.,
2992,BOOK I.,"He is assured of this by a closer examination of the gentle horse,"
2993,BOOK I.,who comes neighing to greet the kinsman and comrade of his master.
2994,BOOK I.,
2995,BOOK I.,"Mounted upon him, and leading his own Brigliadoro, the count"
2996,BOOK I.,"leaves the place, but has not rode far, before he hears the clash"
2997,BOOK I.,"of weapons; when, having first secured Brigliadoro, he rides in"
2998,BOOK I.,"the direction of the sound; and, guided by it, discovers a damsel,"
2999,BOOK I.,"whom three giants were conducting, with a camel and much treasure,"
3000,BOOK I.,which they had carried away by force. One of the giants had charge
3001,BOOK I.,of the lady; while the other two maintained a combat with a
3002,BOOK I.,"cavalier: but this story is broken off, by the author, who hastens"
3003,BOOK I.,"to tell the effects, produced by the death of Agrican."
3004,BOOK I.,
3005,BOOK I.,All was rout and dismay in the Tartarian army; and Galaphron
3006,BOOK I.,"entering the enemy's camp, set free Astolpho and the other"
3007,BOOK I.,"prisoners, who were detained there. Astolpho is scarcely presented"
3008,BOOK I.,"to Angelica, before he demands the means of avenging himself on"
3009,BOOK I.,"the enemy, and being furnished with a horse and arms, immediately"
3010,BOOK I.,returns into the field. Here he is fortunate enough to meet one
3011,BOOK I.,"clad in his own armour, and armed with the enchanted lance."
3012,BOOK I.,
3013,BOOK I.,"Of these he immediately repossesses himself, and joins Galaphron"
3014,BOOK I.,"and his troops, who had pursued the flying enemy to the banks of a"
3015,BOOK I.,"river, fast by where Rinaldo and Marphisa were still engaged."
3016,BOOK I.,"Marphisa was protected by enchanted harness, yet was armed with"
3017,BOOK I.,"but half a sword; which, as related, was severed by Fusberta. On"
3018,BOOK I.,"the other hand, the greater part of Rinaldo's defensive armour had"
3019,BOOK I.,been hewed away.
3020,BOOK I.,
3021,BOOK I.,"Galaphron instantly knows Marphisa by her cognizance, but is at a"
3022,BOOK I.,"loss to distinguish Rinaldo; till, observing Rabican, who had"
3023,BOOK I.,"belonged to Argalia, he conceived that he saw in him the murderer"
3024,BOOK I.,"of his son. Under this persuasion he rode at Rinaldo, and smote"
3025,BOOK I.,"him with all his force, when Marphisa, enraged at this"
3026,BOOK I.,"interference, immediately turned her arms against her aged"
3027,BOOK I.,"commander. Brandimart and others coming up, rescue him from the"
3028,BOOK I.,"hands of the virago, whom they take for some warrior of the Tartar"
3029,BOOK I.,"troops; when Rinaldo, as generous as Marphisa, not enduring to see"
3030,BOOK I.,"his former enemy overlaid with odds, joins her against those with"
3031,BOOK I.,whom she is now engaged. The main body of Galaphron's army coming
3032,BOOK I.,"up, reinforces the enemies of Marphisa; who is on her part"
3033,BOOK I.,"supported by the arrival of her own division, by whose succour,"
3034,BOOK I.,"joined to that of Rinaldo, she is enabled to repel the assailants."
3035,BOOK I.,
3036,BOOK I.,"All this time, Iroldo, Prasildo, and Flordelis, were standing at"
3037,BOOK I.,"some distance, and the damsel of Marphisa, was entertaining them"
3038,BOOK I.,with a history of the feats and prowess of her mistress. Flordelis
3039,BOOK I.,"is by this alarmed for the safety of Brandimart, one of the first"
3040,BOOK I.,"who had assailed Marphisa, and goes in search of him amongst the"
3041,BOOK I.,"warriors, whom the virago and Rinaldo had scattered, and who were"
3042,BOOK I.,"making, in utter rout and confusion, for Albracca. She, however,"
3043,BOOK I.,"to her infinite content, finds him safe and standing apart from"
3044,BOOK I.,"the fray, he having separated from the enemies of Marphisa, after"
3045,BOOK I.,"she was oppressed by numbers. The happy lovers, thus re-united,"
3046,BOOK I.,"retire into a neighbouring wood, and after giving a loose to their"
3047,BOOK I.,mutual tenderness fall asleep upon the grass.
3048,BOOK I.,
3049,BOOK I.,"Here, however, a new and unexpected peril was impending. Their"
3050,BOOK I.,"caresses were unfortunately overseen by a hermit, who dabbled in"
3051,BOOK I.,"necromancy, and who, excited by the beauties of Flordelis,"
3052,BOOK I.,"determined on making her his prize. Among other secrets, he was"
3053,BOOK I.,"possessed of a root, which had the faculty of throwing the person"
3054,BOOK I.,"to whom it was applied, provided it touched any part of the naked"
3055,BOOK I.,"body, into a profound and indissoluble sleep. Armed with this, he"
3056,BOOK I.,"approaches Flordelis, lifts her coats, and applies it to her"
3057,BOOK I.,"thigh. Having thus so riveted her natural slumber, that he was"
3058,BOOK I.,"sure she could not wake for an hour to come, the hermit snatches"
3059,BOOK I.,"her up, and bears her off; being afraid to try the virtues of his"
3060,BOOK I.,"root upon Brandimart, lest he should awake before the charm was"
3061,BOOK I.,consummated.
3062,BOOK I.,
3063,BOOK I.,Brandimart slept soundly till he was awakened by a loud noise. At
3064,BOOK I.,"the same moment he missed Flordelis: yet, notwithstanding his"
3065,BOOK I.,"unutterable grief, approached the quarter, from whence the sound"
3066,BOOK I.,"proceeded, in which he distinguished the cries of a woman in"
3067,BOOK I.,distress.
3068,BOOK I.,
3069,BOOK I.,"On his arrival he found three giants, who were conducting a file"
3070,BOOK I.,"of camels. Two of them followed, and another preceded the string,"
3071,BOOK I.,"leading one, on which was seated a damsel, with dishevelled hair"
3072,BOOK I.,and weeping bitterly. In her Brandimart believed that he
3073,BOOK I.,"recognised Flordelis, and galloped in fury against the ravishers."
3074,BOOK I.,
3075,BOOK I.,"The giants instantly prepare to resist him, and in the combat"
3076,BOOK I.,"which follows, he is put to great peril, and loses his horse."
3077,BOOK I.,
3078,BOOK I.,"It is at this moment that Orlando, who had lately slain Agrican,"
3079,BOOK I.,comes to his succour. His assistance renders the combat more
3080,BOOK I.,"equal: but Brandimart, though he has killed one of the giants, is"
3081,BOOK I.,"beaten down by another. Orlando, however, avenges him on his"
3082,BOOK I.,"enemy, and clears the field. He has now leisure to look to his"
3083,BOOK I.,"bleeding friend, and finding there is yet life in him, consigns"
3084,BOOK I.,"him to the care of the rescued damsel, who applies the proper"
3085,BOOK I.,medicaments to his wounds.
3086,BOOK I.,
3087,BOOK I.,Marphisa and Rinaldo were this while still in full pursuit of
3088,BOOK I.,"their enemies, who found refuge within the citadel of Albracca."
3089,BOOK I.,"Marphisa having chased them up to the gates, menaced Galaphron"
3090,BOOK I.,"with vengeance; and, indeed, she and Rinaldo had now a common"
3091,BOOK I.,cause. Marphisa on account of her recent quarrel with her former
3092,BOOK I.,leader; and Rinaldo since the fountain of hate had disposed him to
3093,BOOK I.,"enmity with Angelica, and the oath, he had sworn on winning"
3094,BOOK I.,"Rabican, bound him to take vengeance on Truffaldino, one of her"
3095,BOOK I.,"defenders. They accordingly sit down before the place, and, on the"
3096,BOOK I.,"second day, Rinaldo appears beneath the walls, sounds his horn and"
3097,BOOK I.,"defies Truffaldino, king of Baldacca by the titles of traitor,"
3098,BOOK I.,renegade and tyrant.
3099,BOOK I.,
3100,BOOK I.,"There were at this time, within the fortress, many warriors who"
3101,BOOK I.,"had sworn to defend him against Sacripant and Torindo, whom he had"
3102,BOOK I.,"imprisoned, and against all others whatsoever. Truffaldino calls"
3103,BOOK I.,"on these to fulfil their engagement, and several knights, with the"
3104,BOOK I.,"traitor king in the midst of them, descend from the citadel to do"
3105,BOOK I.,"battle with Rinaldo, on his behalf."
3106,BOOK I.,
3107,BOOK I.,"These were the brothers Gryphon and Aquilant, who had enchanted"
3108,BOOK I.,"horse and armour; Uberto, Adrian, and Clarion. They attack Rinaldo"
3109,BOOK I.,"singly and successively. He soon defeats the two first comers, but"
3110,BOOK I.,he finds himself better matched with Gryphon of the enchanted
3111,BOOK I.,"arms; with whom he engages in a long and doubtful battle, after a"
3112,BOOK I.,fruitless expostulation and attempt to negotiate on the part of
3113,BOOK I.,Gryphon.
3114,BOOK I.,
3115,BOOK I.,"Leaving these, the author returns to Brandimart; who, restored to"
3116,BOOK I.,"life by the skill of the damsel, whom he and Orlando rescued from"
3117,BOOK I.,"the giants, is rendered desperate by the discovery, that she is"
3118,BOOK I.,not Flordelis. He curses the hour in which he was rescued from
3119,BOOK I.,"death, as well as that in which he was born, and recapitulates all"
3120,BOOK I.,the circumstances of his life in the following apostrophe:
3121,BOOK I.,
3122,BOOK I.,"""Thou took'st me, Fortune, from a royal dome,"
3123,BOOK I.,"""(Such early blow thy deadly malice gave;)"
3124,BOOK I.,"""And I, thus ravished from my noble home,"
3125,BOOK I.,"""In other lands was sold to be a slave;"
3126,BOOK I.,"""And now, long doomed in foreign climes to roam,"
3127,BOOK I.,"""But her remember to whose breasts I clave;"
3128,BOOK I.,"""(My father's and my country's name effaced,)"
3129,BOOK I.,"""My mother's in my mind is only traced."
3130,BOOK I.,
3131,BOOK I.,"""Never did evil destiny so lour,"
3132,BOOK I.,"""As upon me; to early bondage sold,"
3133,BOOK I.,"""With one, entitled Lord of the Sylvan Tower:"
3134,BOOK I.,"""When, but to make me suffer sevenfold,"
3135,BOOK I.,"""Softened awhile appear'd the faithless Power;"
3136,BOOK I.,"""And the good Master of the Sylvan hold"
3137,BOOK I.,"""Freed me; and having none his name to bear,"
3138,BOOK I.,"""Of his broad lands and living made me heir."
3139,BOOK I.,
3140,BOOK I.,"""But Fortune had so marked me for her prey,"
3141,BOOK I.,"""That to fill up the bitter cup of woe,"
3142,BOOK I.,"""Fairest among the fair, a damsel gay"
3143,BOOK I.,"""She chose in her displeasure to bestow;"
3144,BOOK I.,"""Simply to take the precious prize away."
3145,BOOK I.,"""Then can I choose but sink beneath the blow?"
3146,BOOK I.,"""O thou, that hast renewed my fleeting breath,"
3147,BOOK I.,"""Undo thy work, and give me back to death."""
3148,BOOK I.,
3149,BOOK I.,"Orlando, and the charitable damsel sympathise deeply in his grief;"
3150,BOOK I.,"and the lady, to prove, at least, that he was not single in his"
3151,BOOK I.,"sorrows, begins the narration of her own adventures."
3152,BOOK I.,
3153,BOOK I.,"She informs him, that she was daughter and heir of the king of"
3154,BOOK I.,"_the Distant Isles_, where all the treasure of the earth is"
3155,BOOK I.,accumulated. Gifted with beauty and destined to inherit such
3156,BOOK I.,"riches, two lovers came to demand her in marriage on the same day,"
3157,BOOK I.,Ordauro and Folderico; the one handsome and the other more than
3158,BOOK I.,"seventy years old. The first distinguished by his prowess, the"
3159,BOOK I.,second by his wisdom and riches. The damsel's father inclined in
3160,BOOK I.,favour of Folderico; but the damsel hoped by a sleight to transfer
3161,BOOK I.,herself to Ordauro.
3162,BOOK I.,
3163,BOOK I.,She had accordingly obtained a boon from the monarch; and this
3164,BOOK I.,"was, that no one should have her to wife, who had not previously"
3165,BOOK I.,"vanquished her in the foot-race. By this, she considered herself"
3166,BOOK I.,as secure of success; but Folderico countermined her stratagem.
3167,BOOK I.,"Being paired with her in the course, he had recourse to the"
3168,BOOK I.,"expedient of dropping three golden apples, and the damsel was"
3169,BOOK I.,distanced by the same means as Atalanta. Thus the old man won his
3170,BOOK I.,"wife; who, however, determined on taking such vengeance as was in"
3171,BOOK I.,her power.
3172,BOOK I.,
3173,BOOK I.,"Here the lady, who was her own historian, observed Brandimart's"
3174,BOOK I.,"distraction; who being charged with it, confessed that he had"
3175,BOOK I.,"neither eyes nor ears but for Flordelis, and that he should never"
3176,BOOK I.,"regain possession of himself, till she was found. On this the"
3177,BOOK I.,"damsel and Orlando, who was mounted on Bayardo, and had resigned"
3178,BOOK I.,"his Brigliadoro to Brandimart, as before related, offer to"
3179,BOOK I.,"accompany him in an attempt to recover her, and they immediately"
3180,BOOK I.,proceed upon their search.
3181,BOOK I.,
3182,BOOK I.,"Flordelis, in the interval, had been carried off by the hermit to"
3183,BOOK I.,"a cave; where she woke at the moment that a lion, who harboured"
3184,BOOK I.,"there, sprang forth to punish the intrusion of the ravisher: who"
3185,BOOK I.,"instantly dropt his plunder and fled. The beast, however, passing-by"
3186,BOOK I.,"the proffered prey, follows and tears in pieces the hermit who"
3187,BOOK I.,"had cast it down. Flordelis, while he is thus employed, escapes."
3188,BOOK I.,
3189,BOOK I.,"She, however, only gains a present respite from misfortune; for,"
3190,BOOK I.,"flying at random, she falls into the hands of a hairy savage in"
3191,BOOK I.,"the forest, who binds her to a tree with twigs; and then, gazing"
3192,BOOK I.,"stupidly upon her, casts himself down at a little distance."
3193,BOOK I.,
3194,BOOK I.,"Brandimart was this while in pursuit of her, in the same wood,"
3195,BOOK I.,"accompanied by Orlando and the damsel of the golden apples, who"
3196,BOOK I.,was seated upon his courser's croup. Orlando now entreats that she
3197,BOOK I.,"will finish her story, which she continues."
3198,BOOK I.,
3199,BOOK I.,"Folderico who had won the damsel, carried her to a tower, which he"
3200,BOOK I.,"possessed upon the sea-shore, called Altamura, where he kept her,"
3201,BOOK I.,"together with his treasure, under lock and key, and utterly"
3202,BOOK I.,secluded from the sight of man.*
3203,BOOK I.,
3204,BOOK I.,"* As the author is indebted to Greek fable for the beginning, so"
3205,BOOK I.,"he is to Norman story for this subsequent adventure, which is"
3206,BOOK I.,"taken, with some variation, from an old _fabliau_. See Barbasan's"
3207,BOOK I.,or Le Grand's _fabliaux_. The story would seem to be of Eastern
3208,BOOK I.,origin.
3209,BOOK I.,
3210,BOOK I.,"But what will not love? Ordauro who was also rich, though not so"
3211,BOOK I.,"wealthy as Folderico, purchased a sumptuous palace in the"
3212,BOOK I.,"immediate neighbourhood of Altamura, and at an immense cost made a"
3213,BOOK I.,subterraneous passage from his palace to the damsel's prison; by
3214,BOOK I.,"which he visited and enjoyed her without danger. At last, however,"
3215,BOOK I.,"the lovers, tired of the restraint under which they carried on"
3216,BOOK I.,"their intercourse, and emboldened by success, determined to make a"
3217,BOOK I.,desperate effort to escape.
3218,BOOK I.,
3219,BOOK I.,With this view Ordauro communicates to Folderico news of his
3220,BOOK I.,approaching nuptials with another daughter of Monodontes; for so
3221,BOOK I.,"was called the king of the Distant Isles; and invites him, as his"
3222,BOOK I.,"brother-in-law, to the marriage feast. Folderico having carefully"
3223,BOOK I.,"secured the gates of his tower, goes thither, and finding his wife"
3224,BOOK I.,"installed as bride, becomes ferocious at the sight. Ordauro,"
3225,BOOK I.,"however, with great difficulty, succeeds in appeasing him, by the"
3226,BOOK I.,"assurance that she was a twin-sister of his own wife, to whom she"
3227,BOOK I.,"bore a perfect resemblance; and, by bidding him return to his"
3228,BOOK I.,tower and satisfy himself of the fact. The means of proof appeared
3229,BOOK I.,"decisive, and accordingly Folderico accepts them. He finds his"
3230,BOOK I.,"locks as they were left, and his wife, (who had returned by the"
3231,BOOK I.,"subterraneous passage and changed her dress,) alone and overcome"
3232,BOOK I.,"with melancholy. He again takes the way, which was somewhat"
3233,BOOK I.,"circuitous, to the palace of Ordauro, and again finds her there,"
3234,BOOK I.,shining in all the festivity of a bride. He can no longer resist
3235,BOOK I.,"the conviction that the two persons, whom he had seen, were"
3236,BOOK I.,"different women; lays aside his distrust, and even offers to"
3237,BOOK I.,convoy the bridegroom and his bride on a part of their journey
3238,BOOK I.,"towards Ordauro's natural home, to which he was returning."
3239,BOOK I.,
3240,BOOK I.,A certain advantage was thus gained; since Folderico never left
3241,BOOK I.,"his tower, though locked, for above an hour, and consequently"
3242,BOOK I.,"would have soon discovered his loss, if the lovers had eloped in"
3243,BOOK I.,secret.
3244,BOOK I.,
3245,BOOK I.,The party set out together; and at the end of the first day's
3246,BOOK I.,"journey, Folderico turns back and gallops to his tower. He is now"
3247,BOOK I.,"first assured of his disgrace. Full of rage, he pursues his rival;"
3248,BOOK I.,"but does not dare make any attempt to recover his wife, till he"
3249,BOOK I.,has separated Ordauro from his adherents. Having effected this by
3250,BOOK I.,"a stratagem, he attacks his retainers, and repossesses himself of"
3251,BOOK I.,the lady. He is destined to a short possession of the prize; for
3252,BOOK I.,"he is, on his return, beset by giants, who seize her, and all his"
3253,BOOK I.,treasure; which the wife was carrying off as a dowry to her new
3254,BOOK I.,lord. He himself escapes.
3255,BOOK I.,
3256,BOOK I.,"Orlando listened with curiosity to this relation: but Brandimart,"
3257,BOOK I.,"who only thought upon Flordelis, separated from his companions in"
3258,BOOK I.,"order to pursue a separate search. Whilst he is engaged in this,"
3259,BOOK I.,"he hears her cries, and, directed by them, finds her bound to the"
3260,BOOK I.,"tree. He dismounts from his horse to assist her, and is about to"
3261,BOOK I.,"loosen her bonds, when he is attacked by the savage, armed with a"
3262,BOOK I.,rustic club and shield. This strange woodman is described as
3263,BOOK I.,"gifted with extraordinary strength of body, and distinguished by"
3264,BOOK I.,some strange propensities:
3265,BOOK I.,

3267,BOOK I.,And drank the limpid brook which bubbled by:
3268,BOOK I.,"And (such his nature) ever, it is said,"
3269,BOOK I.,"Wept, when he saw a clear and cloudless sky:"
3270,BOOK I.,"Since, fearful of the sign, he lived in dread,"
3271,BOOK I.,"That tempest, clouds, and cold, and rain were nigh,"
3272,BOOK I.,But joy'd in thunder and in hail; since he
3273,BOOK I.,Hoped warmer suns and happier days to see.
3274,BOOK I.,
3275,BOOK I.,"This savage, but for the exclamation of Flordelis, would have"
3276,BOOK I.,surprised Brandimart in the act of untying her. Being warned by
3277,BOOK I.,"her of his danger, he guarded himself against his attacks, which"
3278,BOOK I.,required all his skill and courage to repel. He indeed hewed in
3279,BOOK I.,"pieces the rustic weapon with which he was armed; but the monster,"
3280,BOOK I.,"closing with him, grasped him in his arms, and attempted to cast"
3281,BOOK I.,"him down a precipice, when he fortunately escaped from his"
3282,BOOK I.,embrace.
3283,BOOK I.,
3284,BOOK I.,"The savage finding himself foiled in this hope, and weaponless,"
3285,BOOK I.,"now flew to a sapling, which he was trying to pluck up by its"
3286,BOOK I.,"roots, when the knight killed him while engaged in the attempt."
3287,BOOK I.,"Brandimart now releases Flordelis, seats her on his horse's croup,"
3288,BOOK I.,"and goes in pursuit of Orlando, from whom he had separated."
3289,BOOK I.,
3290,BOOK I.,"Whilst he is thus engaged, the author resumes the story of"
3291,BOOK I.,"Albracca. Rinaldo was left in close combat with Gryphon, whom he"
3292,BOOK I.,"at last stunned with a desperate blow. When Aquilant, believing"
3293,BOOK I.,"his brother killed, took up the conqueror. Gryphon, however,"
3294,BOOK I.,"reviving from the effects of the stroke, returned to the charge."
3295,BOOK I.,"Marphisa seeing Rinaldo thus oppressed with odds, came to his"
3296,BOOK I.,"assistance; and others again of those sworn to defend Truffaldino,"
3297,BOOK I.,"who was an unwilling spectator of the fray, took part against her"
3298,BOOK I.,"and Rinaldo. Orlando was, this while, pursuing his way in search"
3299,BOOK I.,"of Brandimart, while Brandimart as vainly sought him through the"
3300,BOOK I.,forest.
3301,BOOK I.,
3302,BOOK I.,"Whilst Orlando is thus engaged, he sees a damsel issue from a wood"
3303,BOOK I.,"upon a palfrey, who bears a book and horn. Addressing herself to"
3304,BOOK I.,"the count, she tells him, that, if he is what his countenance"
3305,BOOK I.,"bespeaks him, the fairest adventure awaits him, which ever was"
3306,BOOK I.,"achieved by knight; and which, indeed, had hitherto foiled the"
3307,BOOK I.,"prowess of all who had attempted it, who remained prisoners in the"
3308,BOOK I.,"enchanted garden, which she invites him (if he has the courage"
3309,BOOK I.,sufficient for such an adventure) to attack. Orlando accepts the
3310,BOOK I.,proposal with rapture; the damsel presents him with the book and
3311,BOOK I.,"horn; both necessary for the achievement of the enterprize; and,"
3312,BOOK I.,"having instructed him in the use of them, retires to a distance."
3313,BOOK I.,
3314,BOOK I.,"Orlando accordingly, having first disposed of the other damsel"
3315,BOOK I.,"whom he carried behind him, sounds the bugle, and a rock opens,"
3316,BOOK I.,"from which issue two ferocious bulls, with horns of iron, and"
3317,BOOK I.,strangely coloured hair turned contrary to the natural grain:
3318,BOOK I.,
3319,BOOK I.,"And sometimes green; now black, now white it seemed,"
3320,BOOK I.,"Now yellow, and now red; and ever gleamed."
3321,BOOK I.,
3322,BOOK I.,"Orlando learned from the book, by whose rules he was to proceed,"
3323,BOOK I.,"that he was to bind these beasts; and this done, was to enter the"
3324,BOOK I.,"opening, from which they sallied, and plow with them the space"
3325,BOOK I.,within. Such was to be his first labour.
3326,BOOK I.,
3327,BOOK I.,"The bulls long maintained a severe fight with the champion, and"
3328,BOOK I.,"often tossed, though they could not gore him: at length he so"
3329,BOOK I.,"fatigued them by repeated blows from Durindana, (for their skin"
3330,BOOK I.,"was as impenetrable as his own,) that he was enabled to master"
3331,BOOK I.,"them, seized them by their horns, and bound them separately, with"
3332,BOOK I.,"Bayardo's bridle, to an adjoining column, which was the monument"
3333,BOOK I.,"of the king Bavardo. He then made a plow of Durindana, the point"
3334,BOOK I.,"of which served as a share and the hilt as a handle, yoked the"
3335,BOOK I.,"bulls to the instrument, and having torn off the limb of a tree"
3336,BOOK I.,"for a whip, ploughed, the field as he was directed. The work"
3337,BOOK I.,"accomplished, he loosed his beasts, who ran roaring through the"
3338,BOOK I.,"wood, and disappeared behind a mountain."
3339,BOOK I.,
3340,BOOK I.,"Orlando now devoutly thanks God for his first success, and the"
3341,BOOK I.,"damsel of the book and horn, having dismounted from the palfrey in"
3342,BOOK I.,"the meadow, wreaths her brows with the flowers which it produced."
3343,BOOK I.,"Orlando, however, does not allow himself a longer truce, but"
3344,BOOK I.,sounds a second challenge on his enchanted bugle.
3345,BOOK I.,
3346,BOOK I.,"Upon the second sound, the earth trembles, and a neighbouring hill"
3347,BOOK I.,vomits forth flame; which is followed by the appearance of a fiery
3348,BOOK I.,dragon. The damsel of the golden apples is now about to fly; but
3349,BOOK I.,she of the book and horn bids her
3350,BOOK I.,
3351,BOOK I.,"——""in faith and hope, stand near,"
3352,BOOK I.,"""For only he who proves the quest need fear."""
3353,BOOK I.,
3354,BOOK I.,"The damsel of the golden apples, who resented Orlando's coldness"
3355,BOOK I.,"during their journey through the forest, observes she is glad that"
3356,BOOK I.,"he only is in danger, and that she cannot regret what may happen"
3357,BOOK I.,to him;
3358,BOOK I.,
3359,BOOK I.,"""In that there lives not a more worthless wight."""
3360,BOOK I.,
3361,BOOK I.,"This reproach reaches Orlando's ears, as he consults his book."
3362,BOOK I.,This guide taught him that his only means of safety consisted in
3363,BOOK I.,"cutting off the dragon's head, before he was consumed by the flame"
3364,BOOK I.,"and venom, which issued from her mouth. The head cut off, he was"
3365,BOOK I.,"to perform the labour of Jason, and sow the field in which he had"
3366,BOOK I.,laboured with the serpent's teeth. From these was to spring a crop
3367,BOOK I.,"of armed men; and, if he saved himself from their swords, he might"
3368,BOOK I.,esteem himself the flower of chivalry.
3369,BOOK I.,
3370,BOOK I.,"He has scarce learned his lesson, when the serpent is upon him."
3371,BOOK I.,Orlando protected himself from her assault with his shield; but
3372,BOOK I.,this and all his armour was consumed by the flame which she
3373,BOOK I.,"vomited forth. He contends long with the monster, enveloped in"
3374,BOOK I.,"fire and smoke, but at last separates her head at a blow. He"
3375,BOOK I.,"immediately draws the teeth, puts them into his helmet, and sows"
3376,BOOK I.,them as the book had enjoined. The effect followed which had been
3377,BOOK I.,foretold.
3378,BOOK I.,
3379,BOOK I.,"First, feathers sprouting from the ground appear,"
3380,BOOK I.,By little and by little; then a crest;
3381,BOOK I.,"And next is seen the bust of cavalier,"
3382,BOOK I.,"Furnish'd with manly limbs, and spreading chest."
3383,BOOK I.,"Foot in the front, and horsemen in the rear;"
3384,BOOK I.,"They rise and shout, and lay the lance in rest;"
3385,BOOK I.,"And, drums and trumpets sounding to the charge,"
3386,BOOK I.,"Level the spear, and lift the covering targe."
3387,BOOK I.,
3388,BOOK I.,"Orlando, however, though he had neither lance nor shield left him,"
3389,BOOK I.,soon reaps this harvest with Durindana; and the seed of the
3390,BOOK I.,serpent thus springs and perishes in a day.
3391,BOOK I.,
3392,BOOK I.,"The victory achieved, he blows the third and last blast upon his"

3496,BOOK I.,Norman; even where we should be least inclined to trace it to such

3539,BOOK I.,On the ensuing day the combat is renewed between the former
3540,BOOK I.,"parties with the addition of Astolpho on one side, and of Orlando"

3552,BOOK I.,"Rabican's tail. With the wretch thus suspended, he gallops off at"
3553,BOOK I.,full speed; the superior swiftness of Rabican rendering all
3554,BOOK I.,interference on the behalf of Truffaldino impossible; and drags
3555,BOOK I.,him at his horse's heels till he is dashed in pieces.
3556,BOOK I.,
3557,BOOK I.,"Whilst he is running this cruel course, Rinaldo thunders out"

3636,BOOK I.,him on Oringo.
3637,BOOK I.,
3638,BOOK I.,"""In the mean time, this Ariantes met and attacked me, taking me by"
3639,BOOK I.,"my cognizance for Oringo, and I yielded myself a prisoner, after"
3640,BOOK I.,"little resistance, in the hope of the reward promised by Origilla."
3641,BOOK I.,
3642,BOOK I.,"""Lucrino, who was, this while, dispatched by her in pursuit of me,"
3643,BOOK I.,"fell in with the real Oringo, and both were desperately wounded in"
3644,BOOK I.,"the combat which ensued. Lucrino had, however, strength enough"
3645,BOOK I.,"left to master his opposite, and was bringing him away prisoner,"
3646,BOOK I.,"when he was met by the father of Origilla, who at first judged him"
3647,BOOK I.,"to be Ariantes; but when undeceived on a nearer approach, offered"
3648,BOOK I.,"him his daughter in marriage, whom he had previously promised to"
3649,BOOK I.,"Ariantes on the same conditions, provided he would deliver up his"
3650,BOOK I.,prisoner.
3651,BOOK I.,
3652,BOOK I.,"""The offer was scarcely accepted, when Ariantes arrived, bringing"
3653,BOOK I.,"in me, disguised in the arms of Oringo; and the whole stratagem"
3654,BOOK I.,was now apparent.
3655,BOOK I.,
3656,BOOK I.,"""The clearing up this led to new contests: for Ariantes complained"
3657,BOOK I.,of Lucrino's having taken his bearings; and Oringo thought himself
3658,BOOK I.,wronged in that his had been usurped by me.
3659,BOOK I.,
3660,BOOK I.,"""Now, to wear the ensigns of another is death by our law, unless"
3661,BOOK I.,the penalty be remitted by him who has been offended; and the
3662,BOOK I.,"cause being brought before the king, we were all condemned;"
3663,BOOK I.,"Oringo, for having slain (as before told) Corbino, who was a youth"
3664,BOOK I.,"scarcely capable of defending himself; Ariantes, for having"
3665,BOOK I.,"bargained away the life of another; and Lucrino and myself, for"
3666,BOOK I.,"having usurped arms and ensigns, which we were not entitled to"
3667,BOOK I.,wear.
3668,BOOK I.,
3669,BOOK I.,"""Origilla was condemned to a yet heavier punishment; to wit, to be"
3670,BOOK I.,"hanged up by the hair till she was dead; while we, in the"
3671,BOOK I.,"expectation of our sentence, were to assist in the execution of"
3672,BOOK I.,"hers; and to keep watch and ward over her, as she wavered in the"
3673,BOOK I.,wind. My lot (for we drew lots to determine the order of our
3674,BOOK I.,"guard) happened to be the first, and I have already slain seven"
3675,BOOK I.,"knights, that would have relieved her; whose arms and bearings may"
3676,BOOK I.,"be seen fastened to the tree."""
3677,BOOK I.,
3678,BOOK I.,"The knight had scarcely ended, when the wretched woman gave the"
3679,BOOK I.,"lie to his assertions, and denounced him as having slain those he"
3680,BOOK I.,"mentioned by treachery, hoping by the show of these trophies to"
3681,BOOK I.,terrify others from attempting to defend her.

3684,BOOK I.,"no sooner conquered, than a horn sounds, which a dwarf winds from"
3685,BOOK I.,a tower's top; when another knight takes up the conqueror; and the
3686,BOOK I.,"four concerned are all successively encountered, and dismounted,"
3687,BOOK I.,"by Orlando, who now cuts down the damsel, and departs with her"
3688,BOOK I.,seated on his horse's croup.
3689,BOOK I.,
3690,BOOK I.,"Thus riding together, and beguiling the way with talk, they"
3691,BOOK I.,"descried, in the middle of a meadow, a huge rock of marble cut"
3692,BOOK I.,"into steps, and bearing an inscription in letters of gold; when"
3693,BOOK I.,"the damsel informs him they are near a notable wonder, which well"
3694,BOOK I.,"deserves his examination; since, if he will take the pains of"
3695,BOOK I.,"climbing this pile, which is hollow within, he may from the top"
3696,BOOK I.,"descry Hell and Paradise, opened to the sight below. Orlando"
3697,BOOK I.,"believes the tale, and ascends the steps, when Origilla having"
3698,BOOK I.,"possessed herself of Brigliadoro, laughs at him for his folly and"
3699,BOOK I.,departs.
3700,BOOK I.,
3701,BOOK I.,"Orlando, now examining the inscription, finds it imports nothing"
3702,BOOK I.,"more than that this was the tomb of Ninus, the founder of Nineveh."

3719,ARGUMENT.,"before Albracca, in search of Orlando, with whom he is impatient"
3720,ARGUMENT.,"to terminate his quarrel. On his way, he falls in with a damsel,"
3721,ARGUMENT.,"in whose behalf he combats with an enchanted man, who plunges with"
3722,ARGUMENT.,"him into a lake, in which they both disappear. Agramant, in the"
3723,ARGUMENT.,"meantime, is unable to find Rogero, and Rodomont of Sarza, one of"
3724,ARGUMENT.,"his vassal kings, determines to undertake the expedition alone."
3725,ARGUMENT.,"Orlando, who had been dispatched by Angelica on a perilous quest,"
3726,ARGUMENT.,achieves this and other adventures. She is in the meantime robbed
3727,ARGUMENT.,"of her magic ring by Brunello, who steals his horse from"

3729,ARGUMENT.,"to invade France alone, embarks for that country in a storm, and"
3730,ARGUMENT.,makes good his descent. Orlando now falls in with the enchanted
3731,ARGUMENT.,"man, who had regained the shore after leaving Rinaldo below the"
3732,ARGUMENT.,"waves, and a long combat ensues between them on land and under"
3733,ARGUMENT.,"water. Orlando at length vanquishes him, and makes the conquest of"
3734,ARGUMENT.,"Morgana's garden, of which he was the champion. From this Orlando"
3735,ARGUMENT.,"delivers all her prisoners, except Ziliantes, son of Monodontes,"
3736,ARGUMENT.,"her minion; and more especially Rinaldo, to whom he is reconciled."
3737,ARGUMENT.,"The Christian knights delivered, excepting Orlando, depart to the"

3741,ARGUMENT.,"Brunello, pursued by Marphisa, and is himself plundered by the"
3742,ARGUMENT.,fugitive of his sabre and his horn. He is afterwards entrapped by
3743,ARGUMENT.,"the same spell as the others, and carried prisoner to Damogir, in"
3744,ARGUMENT.,"the empire of Monodontes. This adventure leads to the discovery,"
3745,ARGUMENT.,that Brandimart is the eldest son of Monodontes; for whom his
3746,ARGUMENT.,"younger son, Ziliantes, is also recovered by Orlando, who a second"
3747,ARGUMENT.,"time makes himself master of Morgana. Rinaldo, Astolpho, and the"
3748,ARGUMENT.,"rest, again delivered from prison by him, pursue their way to"

3750,ARGUMENT.,of Alcina. Rinaldo and Rodomont meet in battle in France; but are
3751,ARGUMENT.,separated. The invasion of this country is to be attempted by a
3752,ARGUMENT.,"yet more formidable force than that of Rodomont; for Agramant,"
3753,ARGUMENT.,"having received from Brunello the booty he had made, discovers, by"
3754,ARGUMENT.,"help of the magic ring, the abode of Rogero, and allures him into"
3755,ARGUMENT.,"his service. Orlando, with Angelica, whose covert object is the"
3756,ARGUMENT.,"pursuit of Rinaldo, takes his way to France: she, drinking,"

3771,BOOK II.,"threatened invasion of France; to consult on which, Agramant calls"
3772,BOOK II.,a council of his tributary kings. Here Sobrino strongly opposes
3773,BOOK II.,"the measure; but finding his opposition useless, observes that the"
3774,BOOK II.,"only thing which can render it effectual, will be to get"
3775,BOOK II.,"possession of Rogero, a youth who is the cousin of Agramant by the"
3776,BOOK II.,"mother's side, and now detained a prisoner by the African,"
3777,BOOK II.,"Atlantes, on the mountain of Carena. This advice is better"
3778,BOOK II.,"listened to than the former, and the council breaks up after it"
3779,BOOK II.,"has been adopted, and the king has commanded a search to be"
3780,BOOK II.,"prosecuted for him, on whose presence so much appears to depend."
3781,BOOK II.,
3782,BOOK II.,"The scene now again shifts to Albracca, from before the walls of"
3783,BOOK II.,"which, still besieged by Marphisa, Rinaldo departs in pursuit of"
3784,BOOK II.,"his new enemy, Orlando, accompanied by Astolpho, Iroldo, and"
3785,BOOK II.,Prasildo.
3786,BOOK II.,
3787,BOOK II.,Astolpho was at the head of this party when they fell in with a
3788,BOOK II.,"weeping damsel, who, being questioned as to her cause of sorrow,"
3789,BOOK II.,"related that, on lately crossing a neighbouring bridge, a wretch"
3790,BOOK II.,"had issued from a tower which commanded it, and seized upon her"
3791,BOOK II.,"sister that accompanied her, whom he made prisoner, and whipt"
3792,BOOK II.,"bitterly; having first stript her, and tied her naked to a"
3793,BOOK II.,cypress. Astolpho immediately places the weeping sister behind him
3794,BOOK II.,"on his horse, and all proceed together to effect the deliverance"
3795,BOOK II.,of the damsel.
3796,BOOK II.,
3797,BOOK II.,"The damsel, bridge, tower, and scourging warder are soon descried."
3798,BOOK II.,"Iroldo and Prasildo first encounter the oppressor, but are"
3799,BOOK II.,successively defeated; and the ruffian casts their bodies into a
3800,BOOK II.,"lake, into which the river, bestrid by the bridge, disembogues"
3801,BOOK II.,"itself. Rinaldo now attacks him with as little success, and is"
3802,BOOK II.,beat down with an iron mace; but when the conqueror attempts to
3803,BOOK II.,"dispose of him like the others, he makes such violent efforts to"
3804,BOOK II.,"free himself, that the savage, being unable to throw him, springs"
3805,BOOK II.,with him into the lake; where they both disappear.
3806,BOOK II.,
3807,BOOK II.,"Astolpho remains a long time in affliction upon the banks, but is"
3808,BOOK II.,at last persuaded by the two damsels (for one sister had in the
3809,BOOK II.,meantime freed the other) to depart.
3810,BOOK II.,
3811,BOOK II.,"He accordingly mounts Bayardo, gives Rabican to one of the"
3812,BOOK II.,"damsels, and one of the Babylonian knights' horses to the other;"
3813,BOOK II.,"and they both, thus mounted, go forth under his guidance."
3814,BOOK II.,
3815,BOOK II.,"At this time, Brandimart (who, it may be remembered, was in"
3816,BOOK II.,"Albracca) hearing of Orlando's departure, determines to pursue"
3817,BOOK II.,him.
3818,BOOK II.,
3819,BOOK II.,"The same resolution is taken by Gryphon and Aquilant; and these,"
3820,BOOK II.,"arriving at the shore, find a castle situated upon the beach, with"
3821,BOOK II.,"an open gallery towards the sea. In this, damsels are dancing; and"
3822,BOOK II.,"the brothers are informed by two maids, who are passing with hawks"
3823,BOOK II.,"upon their fists, that it is their usage to detain every"
3824,BOOK II.,"passenger; who is obliged to join in their dance, and to pass a"
3825,BOOK II.,night under their roof.
3826,BOOK II.,
3827,BOOK II.,"The brothers consent to submit to this joyous usage, but have soon"
3828,BOOK II.,reason to repent their complaisance. They soon see a damsel
3829,BOOK II.,"approaching upon Brigliadoro, which she had stolen from Orlando,"
3830,BOOK II.,"as was told in the former book, and who, being interrogated as to"
3831,BOOK II.,"the manner in which she had become mistress of him, said that he"
3832,BOOK II.,was the horse of a knight (describing his ensigns as those of
3833,BOOK II.,"Orlando) whom she had found dead upon a plain, with the body of a"
3834,BOOK II.,giant by his side.
3835,BOOK II.,
3836,BOOK II.,"The two brothers are much distressed by this falsehood, which"
3837,BOOK II.,leaves them little inclination to enjoy the festivities of the
3838,BOOK II.,"castle, in which they had been compelled to join."
3839,BOOK II.,
3840,BOOK II.,"To add to their misfortune, they are surprised the ensuing night"
3841,BOOK II.,"in their beds; and, having been detained for some days in chains,"
3842,BOOK II.,"are, together with the damsel, who had also arrived mounted on"
3843,BOOK II.,"Brigliadoro, led forth for execution. As they are however"
3844,BOOK II.,"conducting to the place of punishment, a stranger knight is seen"
3845,BOOK II.,"approaching; but here the author breaks off, and carries his"
3846,BOOK II.,readers back to the war before Albracca.
3847,BOOK II.,
3848,BOOK II.,Marphisa had now encountered and worsted every one of the
3849,BOOK II.,"defenders of Angelica, in an attack which they made upon her camp,"
3850,BOOK II.,"when she was assailed by Sacripant, who had hitherto been confined"
3851,BOOK II.,to the fortress from the effects of a former wound.
3852,BOOK II.,
3853,BOOK II.,"A desperate combat ensues, in which the Circassian is much"
3854,BOOK II.,assisted by the speed and docility of his horse Frontilatte. In
3855,BOOK II.,the heat of this a courier brings him news of the invasion of his
3856,BOOK II.,"kingdom by Mandricardo, the son of Agrican. As he and Marphisa,"
3857,BOOK II.,"however, cannot agree upon the conditions of a truce, this"
3858,BOOK II.,occasions but a short interruption of the duel; which is at last
3859,BOOK II.,"only broken off by the author, that he may give some account of"
3860,BOOK II.,"the search made for Rogero, in consequence of what was determined"
3861,BOOK II.,at the council of Agramant.
3862,BOOK II.,
3863,BOOK II.,"The emissary of the king returns, reporting the inutility of his"
3864,BOOK II.,"journey, made through the mountain of Carena, and Rodomont,"
3865,BOOK II.,"enraged at the delay, sets out with his own forces for the"
3866,BOOK II.,invasion of France. In the mean time Agramant is assured that
3867,BOOK II.,"Rogero is upon Mount Carena; though the garden, where he is"
3868,BOOK II.,"confined, is invisible; and that the possession of Angelica's ring"
3869,BOOK II.,would enable him to succeed in his enterprise.
3870,BOOK II.,
3871,BOOK II.,Agramant now promises a kingdom to whoever shall obtain for him
3872,BOOK II.,"this prize, and the theft is confidently promised by a dwarf, who"
3873,BOOK II.,is entitled Brunello.
3874,BOOK II.,
3875,BOOK II.,"This while, Orlando, robbed by the damsel of Brigliadoro, was"
3876,BOOK II.,plodding upon his way a-foot: when he one day fell in with an
3877,BOOK II.,"escort of armed men, leading two knights as prisoners, whom he"
3878,BOOK II.,"immediately recognized for Gryphon and Aquilant, and the damsel"
3879,BOOK II.,who had carried off his courser.
3880,BOOK II.,
3881,BOOK II.,"The escort was, it seems, carrying off these to be devoured by the"
3882,BOOK II.,serpent of the garden of Orgagna; but Orlando immediately routs
3883,BOOK II.,"the guard, and sets the prisoners at liberty."
3884,BOOK II.,
3885,BOOK II.,"He has scarcely looked the damsel in the face, when he forgets the"
3886,BOOK II.,"wrongs he has received; and Gryphon, who had exchanged hearts with"
3887,BOOK II.,"her, almost at sight, is yet more fascinated by her graces."
3888,BOOK II.,"Orlando observing this, under some pretence sends the two brothers"
3889,BOOK II.,"away, that he may keep her to himself; and sitting down by her on"
3890,BOOK II.,"the grass, begins to woo her with such courtesy as he can."
3891,BOOK II.,
3892,BOOK II.,"While he is thus engaged, another damsel approaches on a white"
3893,BOOK II.,"palfrey, who warns Orlando of impending danger, and informs him he"
3894,BOOK II.,is close to the garden of Orgagna. Orlando is delighted at the
3895,BOOK II.,"intelligence, and entreats her to inform him how he is to procure"
3896,BOOK II.,admittance.
3897,BOOK II.,
3898,BOOK II.,"She promises him full instructions; and, as the first of these,"
3899,BOOK II.,"tells him he must keep himself chaste for three days, previous to"
3900,BOOK II.,"attempting the adventure, if he would preserve himself from being"
3901,BOOK II.,"devoured by the dragon, who guards the gate. She then says she"
3902,BOOK II.,"will give him a book, in which he will find painted the garden and"
3903,BOOK II.,"all it contains, together with the palace of the false"
3904,BOOK II.,"enchantress, which she had only entered the day before, for the"
3905,BOOK II.,purpose of executing a magic work in which she was engaged.
3906,BOOK II.,
3907,BOOK II.,"This, which was the manufacture of a sword, capable of cutting"
3908,BOOK II.,"through even enchanted substances, she only pursued on moonless"
3909,BOOK II.,nights. The object of this labour was the destruction of a knight
3910,BOOK II.,"of the west, hight Orlando; who, she had read in the book of Fate,"
3911,BOOK II.,"was destined to demolish her garden. To this, the damsel adds,"
3912,BOOK II.,"that the garden can only be entered at sunrise; and, having"
3913,BOOK II.,"presented him with a book of instructions, departs."
3914,BOOK II.,
3915,BOOK II.,"Orlando, who finds he must delay his enterprize till the next"
3916,BOOK II.,"morning, now lies down, and is soon asleep. In the mean time,"
3917,BOOK II.,"Origilla, who was still with him, meditated her escape, in order"
3918,BOOK II.,"to rejoin Gryphon; and yielding to the impulse of her evil nature,"
3919,BOOK II.,"was about to slay Orlando with his own sword, which she had drawn"
3920,BOOK II.,"for the purpose. Afraid, however, to execute her design, she"
3921,BOOK II.,"mounts Brigliadoro, and gallops off, carrying away Durindana."
3922,BOOK II.,
3923,BOOK II.,"Orlando wakes, in such indignation as may be supposed, on the"
3924,BOOK II.,"discovery of the theft; but, like a good knight and true, is not"
3925,BOOK II.,to be diverted from his enterprise. He tears off a huge branch of
3926,BOOK II.,"elm to supply the place of his sword, and, the sun rising, takes"
3927,BOOK II.,"his way towards the eastern gate, where the dragon was on his"
3928,BOOK II.,watch.
3929,BOOK II.,
3930,BOOK II.,This he slays by repeated blows upon the spine; but finds that the
3931,BOOK II.,"wall of the enchanted garden, which he had entered, was closed"
3932,BOOK II.,"upon him. Looking round him, he saw a fair fountain of water,"
3933,BOOK II.,"which overflowed into a river, and in the centre of the fountain"
3934,BOOK II.,"was a figure, on whose forehead was written,"
3935,BOOK II.,
3936,BOOK II.,"""The stream which waters violet and rose,"
3937,BOOK II.,"""From hence to the enchanted palace flows."""
3938,BOOK II.,
3939,BOOK II.,"Following the banks of this flowery stream, and rapt in the"
3940,BOOK II.,"delights of the delicious garden, Orlando arrives at the palace,"
3941,BOOK II.,"and entering it, finds the mistress, clad in white, and with a"
3942,BOOK II.,"crown of gold upon her head, in the act of viewing herself in the"
3943,BOOK II.,surface of the fatal sword. He surprises her before she can
3944,BOOK II.,"escape, deprives her of the weapon, and holding her fast by her"
3945,BOOK II.,"long hair, which floated behind, threatens her with immediate"
3946,BOOK II.,death if she does not instruct him in the means of retreat.
3947,BOOK II.,
3948,BOOK II.,"Falerina, however, was firm of purpose, and refused. Hence"
3949,BOOK II.,"Orlando, being unable to move her either by threats or kindness,"
3950,BOOK II.,was under the necessity of binding her to a beech. Having thus
3951,BOOK II.,"secured his prisoner, he renewed his questions, but she still"
3952,BOOK II.,refused to point out the gate of the garden.
3953,BOOK II.,
3954,BOOK II.,"He now bethinks him of his book, and consulting it, finds there is"
3955,BOOK II.,"an entrance to the south but that it is watched by a bull, with"
3956,BOOK II.,"one horn of iron, and another of flame."
3957,BOOK II.,
3958,BOOK II.,"Moreover, before arriving at this, there is another impediment: a"
3959,BOOK II.,"lake is to be passed, pregnant with new danger; but to provide"
3960,BOOK II.,"against this, he is instructed by his book. According to its"
3961,BOOK II.,"directions,"
3962,BOOK II.,
3963,BOOK II.,*        *        *        *
3964,BOOK II.,*        *        *        *
3965,BOOK II.,"He, still his path pursuing, gathers posies"
3966,BOOK II.,"Of flowers, which every where about him spring."
3967,BOOK II.,"And filling well his casque and ears with roses,"
3968,BOOK II.,Lists if he hears the birds in green-wood sing:
3969,BOOK II.,"He sees the gaping beak, the swelling throat,"
3970,BOOK II.,"And ruffled plumes, but cannot catch a note."
3971,BOOK II.,
3972,BOOK II.,"Having thus proved the force of his defence, he proceeds towards"
3973,BOOK II.,"the lake, which was small but deep; and so clear and tranquil,"
3974,BOOK II.,that the eye could penetrate to the bottom.
3975,BOOK II.,
3976,BOOK II.,"He is no sooner arrived upon the banks, than the waters are seen"
3977,BOOK II.,"to gurgle; and a syren, rising midway out of the pool, sings so"
3978,BOOK II.,"sweetly, that birds and beasts troop to the water-side, attracted"
3979,BOOK II.,by her song. Of this the count hears nothing; but feigning to
3980,BOOK II.,"yield to the charm, sinks down beside the water; from which the"
3981,BOOK II.,syren issues with the intent to accomplish his destruction.
3982,BOOK II.,"Orlando, however, seizes her by the hair, and, while singing yet"
3983,BOOK II.,"louder (song being her only defence), cuts off her head, and (so"
3984,BOOK II.,instructed by the book) stains himself all over with her blood.
3985,BOOK II.,
3986,BOOK II.,"Having done this as a protection against the horns of the bull,"
3987,BOOK II.,"and taken the roses from his helmet and ears, he proceeds towards"
3988,BOOK II.,the southern gate.
3989,BOOK II.,
3990,BOOK II.,"Here he is encountered by the bull, whose horn of iron he severs"
3991,BOOK II.,"at a stroke. His horn of flame was however yet left, and by this"
3992,BOOK II.,"Orlando, but for the virtue of the syren's blood, would have been"
3993,BOOK II.,"consumed. Guarded by this, he pursues his advantage, and at last"
3994,BOOK II.,"slaughters his enemy. The bull is, however, no sooner slain, than"
3995,BOOK II.,"the gate, of which he is the guardian, disappears, the wall"
3996,BOOK II.,"closes, and Orlando again finds himself a prisoner, without the"
3997,BOOK II.,means of escape.
3998,BOOK II.,
3999,BOOK II.,"Again resorting to his book, he finds that another river, running"
4000,BOOK II.,"westward, leads to a gate formed of jewels, which is kept by an"
4001,BOOK II.,enchanted ass.
4002,BOOK II.,
4003,BOOK II.,"Taking his course towards this, he arrives at a tree of surprising"
4004,BOOK II.,"height, and again consulting his book, razes off his crest, and"
4005,BOOK II.,makes a penthouse of his shield for the protection of his sight.
4006,BOOK II.,"Covering himself with it, he advances with his eyes fixed upon the"
4007,BOOK II.,"ground, towards the miraculous tree."
4008,BOOK II.,
4009,BOOK II.,"On approaching it, a harpy with a beautiful female head, and"
4010,BOOK II.,"crowned with strangely coloured plumes, flutters out from the"
4011,BOOK II.,"branches, and hovering above the count, squirts her ordure at his"
4012,BOOK II.,"head. This is fortunately protected by his shield, on which it"
4013,BOOK II.,"hisses like boiling oil. Orlando, distracted by the yells of the"
4014,BOOK II.,"harpy, is often tempted to raise his eyes: he however perseveres"
4015,BOOK II.,"in keeping them fixed to the ground till he is near the tree, when"
4016,BOOK II.,"he falls, as if blinded by the burning liquor. The bird now swoops"
4017,BOOK II.,"to the ground, and having darted her talons into his breast-plate,"
4018,BOOK II.,attempts to drag him towards the trunk. The count sees his time is
4019,BOOK II.,"come, and dispatches her with a back-handed stroke of his sword."
4020,BOOK II.,
4021,BOOK II.,"The harpy demolished, he re-adjusted his crest, the gift of"
4022,BOOK II.,"Angelica, braced his shield anew, and took his way towards the"
4023,BOOK II.,"western gate. Nothing was ever seen more beautiful than this, with"
4024,BOOK II.,"respect to the materials, or the workmanship. Nor was the animal"
4025,BOOK II.,"who kept it less extraordinary; being an ass, armed with scales of"
4026,BOOK II.,"gold, and ears of such length and strength, as to be able to"
4027,BOOK II.,"seize, and drag to himself by the aid of them, whatever was within"
4028,BOOK II.,"his reach; his tail cut like a trenchant sword, and his bray made"
4029,BOOK II.,the forest tremble.
4030,BOOK II.,
4031,BOOK II.,"Though his golden scales had resisted all other weapons, they were"
4032,BOOK II.,"not impenetrable by Orlando's steel, and he smote off his head at"
4033,BOOK II.,a blow.
4034,BOOK II.,
4035,BOOK II.,A strange wonder followed; the earth swallowed the carcase of the
4036,BOOK II.,"ass, this gate too disappeared, and the walls again closed upon"
4037,BOOK II.,Orlando.
4038,BOOK II.,
4039,BOOK II.,"He is now directed by his instructions to a a northern entrance,"
4040,BOOK II.,"and, strong in patience, proceeds in this direction. On his way"
4041,BOOK II.,thither he sees a table spread in the wilderness. He is tempted by
4042,BOOK II.,"the viands; but recurring to the book, is informed of his danger,"
4043,BOOK II.,and refrains.
4044,BOOK II.,
4045,BOOK II.,From this he learns that a faun lay conceale amongst the
4046,BOOK II.,"neighbouring thorns and roses, provided with a chain, with which"
4047,BOOK II.,she snared whoever tasted of the banquet. She fled from Orlando on
4048,BOOK II.,"his approaching her haunt, dragging after her a serpent's tail,"
4049,BOOK II.,"till then concealed, which was as loathsome as her face was"
4050,BOOK II.,"lovely. Being overtaken, she made no defence and was slaughtered"
4051,BOOK II.,at a blow.
4052,BOOK II.,
4053,BOOK II.,"The count now arrives at the northern gate, which he finds guarded"
4054,BOOK II.,by a giant. Orlando had so often been engaged with enemies of this
4055,BOOK II.,"description, that he thought little of the combat in which he was"
4056,BOOK II.,"going to engage. In effect, his expectations were in part"
4057,BOOK II.,"justified, as he slew his adversary. This was, however, but the"
4058,BOOK II.,"beginning of his labour; for, from the blood of the slaughtered"
4059,BOOK II.,"enemy sprang a fire, and from this issued two other giants yet"
4060,BOOK II.,fiercer than the first. Orlando sees that to spill the blood of
4061,BOOK II.,"these, would be but to multiply his foes, and accordingly,"
4062,BOOK II.,"changing his mode of proceeding, grapples with one of the two in"
4063,BOOK II.,"the hopes of squeezing him to death. He is, however, still"
4064,BOOK II.,"interrupted by the other, before he can accomplish his purpose;"
4065,BOOK II.,and at last sees the necessity of separating them.
4066,BOOK II.,
4067,BOOK II.,"To effect this, he feigns to fly, but the giants, instead of"
4068,BOOK II.,"pursuing, return to keep guard over the enchanted gate. If,"
4069,BOOK II.,"however, Orlando was disappointed in his hope of dividing them,"
4070,BOOK II.,his stratagem was productive of another advantage. He saw the
4071,BOOK II.,"chain lying on the ground, which was spread for his destruction by"
4072,BOOK II.,"the faun. Returning with this, he nooses the giants and then again"
4073,BOOK II.,recurs to the book for his future proceedings.
4074,BOOK II.,
4075,BOOK II.,"This informs him, that the total destruction of the garden (the"
4076,BOOK II.,task imposed by Angelica) can only be accomplished by tearing off
4077,BOOK II.,"a certain branch of a lofty tree, in which was involved the"
4078,BOOK II.,destiny of this fairy creation.
4079,BOOK II.,
4080,BOOK II.,"According to the rules which he received, he returned through a"
4081,BOOK II.,"spacious valley towards the palace, passing Falerina, whom he had"
4082,BOOK II.,"left fastened to the beech. He soon descries the fatal tree, which"
4083,BOOK II.,"is of an immeasurable height: while the stem, even at the bottom,"
4084,BOOK II.,is no more than a palm in girt.
4085,BOOK II.,
4086,BOOK II.,No thicker; but from this close branch and spray
4087,BOOK II.,"Bristled, whence foliage green and narrow grew."
4088,BOOK II.,"The leaves which died and sprouted every day,"
4089,BOOK II.,Conceal'd within sharp pointed thorns from view:
4090,BOOK II.,Apples of gold the loaded twigs display;
4091,BOOK II.,"Apples in form, but burnish'd gold in hue."
4092,BOOK II.,"Suspended from small stalks, so slight in show."
4093,BOOK II.,The man had periled life who walked below.
4094,BOOK II.,
4095,BOOK II.,To obviate this danger (and we are afterwards told that the fruit
4096,BOOK II.,"was as large as the human head), Orlando forms a sort of grating"
4097,BOOK II.,"of boughs of trees, and, under cover of this, proceeds towards the"
4098,BOOK II.,"tree, amidst a shower of the golden apples, which fall, loosened"
4099,BOOK II.,"by the vibration of the soil beneath his feet. Having reached it,"
4100,BOOK II.,"he severs the trunk close to the root, and every thing is"
4101,BOOK II.,instantly involved in darkness.
4102,BOOK II.,
4103,BOOK II.,"The cloud at length clears away, and the sun shines forth upon a"
4104,BOOK II.,"wild landscape; where no vestige is to be seen of the garden, or"
4105,BOOK II.,"trace of the adventure, except in the appearance of the fairy"
4106,BOOK II.,"Falerina, who remains in the middle of the wilderness, fastened to"
4107,BOOK II.,the beech.
4108,BOOK II.,
4109,BOOK II.,"Her tone is now changed, and she entreats Orlando's mercy,"
4110,BOOK II.,assuring him that many lives depend upon the preservation of hers.
4111,BOOK II.,"She explains herself by saying, that she had constructed the"
4112,BOOK II.,"garden and a neighbouring snare in a bridge over a torrent, in"
4113,BOOK II.,"order to be revenged on a knight called Ariantes, and an infamous"
4114,BOOK II.,"woman of the name of Origilla, who, though many had fallen into"
4115,BOOK II.,"her toils, had both hitherto escaped."
4116,BOOK II.,
4117,BOOK II.,"""Many,"" pursues the fairy, ""were entrapped in my garden, and yet"
4118,BOOK II.,more at the bridge; and here it was that I took a certain
4119,BOOK II.,"enchantress, daughter of king Galaphron, who by some secret means"
4120,BOOK II.,"escaped, and effected the deliverance of her fellow prisoners."
4121,BOOK II.,"Many more, however, have been taken since, and all these will"
4122,BOOK II.,"perish, if you are resolved on my destruction."" Orlando"
4123,BOOK II.,"immediately promised her life, upon her pledging herself for the"
4124,BOOK II.,deliverance of the captives.
4125,BOOK II.,
4126,BOOK II.,"With this view they proceed together, towards the bridge; but the"
4127,BOOK II.,"author snaps this thread, to take up that of the story of"
4128,BOOK II.,Albracca.
4129,BOOK II.,
4130,BOOK II.,"Here Sacripant and Marphisa were left engaged in a single combat,"
4131,BOOK II.,"which was still continued with mutual animosity; while Angelica,"
4132,BOOK II.,"surrounded by a group of warriors, sate contemplating the fight"
4133,BOOK II.,from the ramparts of the citadel. While the attention of all was
4134,BOOK II.,"thus engaged, Brunello, who (it will be remembered) had undertaken"
4135,BOOK II.,"to steal Angelica's ring, arrived beneath the walls of Albracca,"
4136,BOOK II.,"scaled the rock and walls of the fortress, while the crowd was"
4137,BOOK II.,"watching the duel, and disputing on its probable result,"
4138,BOOK II.,"approached the princess unobserved, and, slipping the ring from"
4139,BOOK II.,"her finger, escaped amid the confusion which followed."
4140,BOOK II.,
4141,BOOK II.,"Having descended safely to the ground, and swam a water by which"
4142,BOOK II.,"the citadel was surrounded, the dwarf perceived that the two"
4143,BOOK II.,"combatants had separated for an interval of repose, and"
4144,BOOK II.,"immediately meditated a new exercise of his art. With this view,"
4145,BOOK II.,"he approached Sacripant, who, absorbed in an amorous reverie, sate"
4146,BOOK II.,"apart, upon his courser, and having first loosened the girths, and"
4147,BOOK II.,"supported the saddle by a piece of wood, withdrew the horse from"
4148,BOOK II.,under him.*
4149,BOOK II.,
4150,BOOK II.,* The reader will recollect the imitation of this absurd incident
4151,BOOK II.,"in ""Don Quixote,"" whose squire's ass, Dapple, is stolen in a"
4152,BOOK II.,similar manner.
4153,BOOK II.,
4154,BOOK II.,"Marphisa, who was at a little distance, witnessed this with"
4155,BOOK II.,"wonder, and, before she recovered from her astonishment, was"
4156,BOOK II.,herself plundered of her sword. Marphisa is no sooner aware of the
4157,BOOK II.,"theft, than she pursues the robber; but he, mounted upon"
4158,BOOK II.,"Frontilatte, his new acquisition, soon distances the pursuer."
4159,BOOK II.,
4160,BOOK II.,"While Angelica, who felt her misfortune yet more than the others,"
4161,BOOK II.,"is in despair at the loss of her treasure, an alarm is given by"
4162,BOOK II.,"the warder, who reports the arrival of a new army before Albracca."
4163,BOOK II.,"This was a Turkish force, led by Caramano, brother of Torindo, one"
4164,BOOK II.,"of the princes who had been seized and imprisoned by Truffaldino,"
4165,BOOK II.,"and who, having refused to enter into the engagement to which the"
4166,BOOK II.,"others agreed, on his delivering them from durance, now brought"
4167,BOOK II.,this brother against Albracca.
4168,BOOK II.,
4169,BOOK II.,"Angelica's last hopes of deliverance rest upon Gradasso; who, it"
4170,BOOK II.,"seems, was her relation, and who was meditating anew the invasion"
4171,BOOK II.,of France. Hence Sacripant undertakes a secret embassy to this
4172,BOOK II.,"prince, with the view of soliciting his succour."
4173,BOOK II.,
4174,BOOK II.,"Rodomont, this while, who was too impatient to wait for"
4175,BOOK II.,"_Agramant's_ attack upon Charlemagne, had already sailed for"
4176,BOOK II.,France. A tremendous storm wrecked his fleet upon the coast of
4177,BOOK II.,"that kingdom; but he, landing with such force as the tempest had"
4178,BOOK II.,"left him, made good his footing, and routed the Christians in more"
4179,BOOK II.,engagements than one: though the balance at last turned in their
4180,BOOK II.,favour.
4181,BOOK II.,
4182,BOOK II.,"Previous, however, to this, Gano, or Ganelon, (as he is sometimes"
4183,BOOK II.,"called) enters into a traitorous correspondence with Marsilius,"
4184,BOOK II.,whom he invites into France.
4185,BOOK II.,
4186,BOOK II.,"While great events are preparing in this quarter, the author"
4187,BOOK II.,"resumes the story of Orlando, who was journeying with Falerina"
4188,BOOK II.,"towards the bridge, where so many prisoners were entrapped. On"
4189,BOOK II.,"their way thither, however, they arrived at a yet more perilous"
4190,BOOK II.,"pass: this was the bridge, and lake into which the felon warrior"
4191,BOOK II.,"leaped with Rinaldo in his arms. Falerina, enchantress as she was,"
4192,BOOK II.,"turned pale at the sight of this place, and cursed the hour in"
4193,BOOK II.,which they had taken the road which conducted them thither;
4194,BOOK II.,"informing Orlando that they were approaching a snare, laid by"
4195,BOOK II.,Morgana; who plotted revenge against a knight who had destroyed
4196,BOOK II.,"many of her spells, and set at nought her riches and her power."
4197,BOOK II.,
4198,BOOK II.,"For this purpose she had formed the lake; and selected, as a"
4199,BOOK II.,"defender of the pass, a man named Arridano, a churl of the most"
4200,BOOK II.,ferocious and pitiless character she could find. Him she had
4201,BOOK II.,"clothed in invulnerable arms, and charmed in such a manner, that"
4202,BOOK II.,his strength always increased in a six-fold proportion to that of
4203,BOOK II.,"the adversary with whom he was matched. Hence, no one had hitherto"
4204,BOOK II.,"escaped from the contest; since, such was his strength and power"
4205,BOOK II.,"of endurance, that he could breathe freely under water. Hence,"
4206,BOOK II.,"having grappled with a knight, and sunk with him to the bottom of"
4207,BOOK II.,"the lake, he returned, bearing his arms in triumph to the top."
4208,BOOK II.,
4209,BOOK II.,"While Falerina is explaining the danger of the enterprise, Orlando"
4210,BOOK II.,"sees Rinaldo's arms, erected in form of a trophy, amongst other"
4211,BOOK II.,"spoils made by the villain; and forgetting their late quarrel,"
4212,BOOK II.,determines upon revenging his friend. A desperate contest ensues
4213,BOOK II.,"between the churl and the knight, during which Falerina flies. The"
4214,BOOK II.,"combatants (as in the case of Rinaldo) both grapple, and sink"
4215,BOOK II.,"together in the water. Arrived at the bottom, Orlando finds"
4216,BOOK II.,"himself in another world, upon a dry meadow, with the lake"
4217,BOOK II.,"overhead, through which shone the beams of our sun; the meadow"
4218,BOOK II.,being on all sides surrounded by a crystal wall. Here the battle
4219,BOOK II.,"was renewed, and in this Orlando had an advantage, which none had"
4220,BOOK II.,"hitherto possessed. Besides that he was himself invulnerable, he"
4221,BOOK II.,"was now in possession of the sword, tempered by Falerina, against"
4222,BOOK II.,"which no spells could avail. Thus armed, and countervailing the"
4223,BOOK II.,"strength of his adversary by his superior skill and activity, he"
4224,BOOK II.,had the good fortune to lay him dead upon the field.
4225,BOOK II.,
4226,BOOK II.,"Orlando having slain his foe, discovers a gate in the crystal"
4227,BOOK II.,"wall; and having passed through a dark labyrinth, comes at last"
4228,BOOK II.,"where it is lighted by a carbuncle, whose lustre was equal to that"
4229,BOOK II.,of day. This discovered to his view a river little less than
4230,BOOK II.,"twenty-yards over, and beyond this was seen a field as thickly"
4231,BOOK II.,covered with precious stones as the sky is full of stars.
4232,BOOK II.,
4233,BOOK II.,"Over this was thrown a bridge, only half a palm wide, and at each"
4234,BOOK II.,end was stationed an iron figure with a mace. Orlando no sooner
4235,BOOK II.,"attempted to pass this, than the figures smote upon it, and it was"
4236,BOOK II.,"instantly engulphed in the stream. Orlando however, being resolved"
4237,BOOK II.,"to accomplish the adventure or perish in the attempt, leapt the"
4238,BOOK II.,"river and arrived in the field, which contained the treasures of"
4239,BOOK II.,the fairy.
4240,BOOK II.,
4241,BOOK II.,"When he had arrived at the other extremity of this, he entered a"
4242,BOOK II.,"building, where he beheld the likeness of a king, surrounded by"
4243,BOOK II.,"his peers, and encompassed by all the pomp and magnificence of"
4244,BOOK II.,"royalty. The monarch appeared to be seated at a banquet, with a"
4245,BOOK II.,"naked sword suspended over his head, and on the table before him"
4246,BOOK II.,"was a live coal, supported on a golden lily, which gave light to"
4247,BOOK II.,the apartment. On his left stood a figure with a bended bow in
4248,BOOK II.,"guise of one who waits the crossing of the stag; and on the right,"
4249,BOOK II.,"the form of one, who, from his likeness to the king, appeared to"
4250,BOOK II.,"be his brother, and who bore in one hand a writing illustrative of"
4251,BOOK II.,the vanity of his worldly pursuits.
4252,BOOK II.,
4253,BOOK II.,The troubled countenance of the king seemed to bear witness to the
4254,BOOK II.,"truth of the inscription; and Orlando, having satisfied his"
4255,BOOK II.,"curiosity, departed through the door opposite to that by which he"
4256,BOOK II.,"had entered. He was however no sooner out of the apartment, than"
4257,BOOK II.,all was darkness.
4258,BOOK II.,
4259,BOOK II.,"After wandering for some time at random, he bethought himself of"
4260,BOOK II.,"the coal, which was burning before the king, and returned in order"
4261,BOOK II.,"to take it. He had however no sooner laid his hand upon this, than"
4262,BOOK II.,"the archer let fly his arrow, which extinguished it, and night"
4263,BOOK II.,"followed. This was rendered terrible by an earthquake, which shook"
4264,BOOK II.,"the world to its centre. The earthquake at last ceased, the light"
4265,BOOK II.,"rekindled of itself, and all was as before. Again Orlando issued"
4266,BOOK II.,"through the dark passage, again was compelled to return in search"
4267,BOOK II.,"of the coal, and again witnessed the same effect."
4268,BOOK II.,
4269,BOOK II.,A third attempt was more successful: he intercepted the arrow with
4270,BOOK II.,"his shield, and carried off the light in safety. Using this as a"
4271,BOOK II.,"lamp, Orlando arrived where the way divided; and turning to the"
4272,BOOK II.,"left, instead of the right (which would have conducted him out of"
4273,BOOK II.,the building) took the road which led to the dungeons of Morgana.
4274,BOOK II.,"Here were imprisoned Rinaldo, Dudon, Brandimart, and others who"
4275,BOOK II.,had fallen into the power of Morgana; but the count did not
4276,BOOK II.,immediately arrive at their place of confinement. Still guiding
4277,BOOK II.,"himself by his light, he came to a cleft in the rock, through"
4278,BOOK II.,"which he passed into a flowery meadow, planted with trees covered"
4279,BOOK II.,"with fruit and flowers, and full of all imaginable delights."
4280,BOOK II.,
4281,BOOK II.,"In the middle of this was a fountain, and fast by it lay Morgana"
4282,BOOK II.,"asleep; a lady of a lovely aspect, dressed in white and vermilion"
4283,BOOK II.,"garments; her forehead well furnished with hair, but with scarcely"
4284,BOOK II.,any behind.
4285,BOOK II.,
4286,BOOK II.,"While Orlando stood in silence, contemplating her beauty, he heard"
4287,BOOK II.,"a voice exclaim, ""Seize the fairy by the forelock if thou hopest"
4288,BOOK II.,"fair success;"" Orlando turning, and advancing in the direction"
4289,BOOK II.,"from which the voice came, discovered a prison of crystal in which"
4290,BOOK II.,he beheld the captives of Morgana.
4291,BOOK II.,
4292,BOOK II.,"At the sight of these, he raised his sabre to smite the wall; but"
4293,BOOK II.,was advertised by a female prisoner that all attempts to release
4294,BOOK II.,them would only be productive of new misery to those he sought to
4295,BOOK II.,"benefit, unless he could take Morgana herself, and force from her"
4296,BOOK II.,the keys of their prison-house.
4297,BOOK II.,
4298,BOOK II.,"Thus admonished, he returned towards the fountain. But the fairy,"
4299,BOOK II.,"who was awake and risen, was now dancing round its border with the"
4300,BOOK II.,"lightness of a leaf, and timing her steps to the following song:"
4301,BOOK II.,
4302,BOOK II.,"""Who in this world would wealth and treasure share,"
4303,BOOK II.,"""Honour, delight, and state, and what is best,"
4304,BOOK II.,"""Quick let him catch me by the lock of hair"
4305,BOOK II.,"""Which flutters from my forehead, and be blest;"
4306,BOOK II.,"""But let him not the proffered good forbear,"
4307,BOOK II.,"""Nor, till he seize the fleeting blessing, rest."
4308,BOOK II.,"""For present loss is sought in vain to-morrow,"
4309,BOOK II.,"""And the deluded wretch is left in sorrow."""
4310,BOOK II.,
4311,BOOK II.,"The fairy, however, no sooner set eyes on the count, than she"
4312,BOOK II.,"bounded off, and fled from the flowery meadow over a high and"
4313,BOOK II.,inhospitable mountain. Orlando pursued her through thorns and
4314,BOOK II.,"rocks, though the sky, on her gaining this dreary scene, became"
4315,BOOK II.,"overcast, and he was assailed by tempest, lightning and hail."
4316,BOOK II.,
4317,BOOK II.,"While Orlando thus pursues, enveloped in storm, a pale and meagre"
4318,BOOK II.,"woman issues from a cave, armed with a whip, and treading close"
4319,BOOK II.,"upon the pursuer, scourges him, till his skin is raised in"
4320,BOOK II.,"furrows. She informs him, while she inflicts this discipline, that"
4321,BOOK II.,"she is Penitence, and sent to punish him for having neglected to"
4322,BOOK II.,"seize Morgana, when he found her sleeping by the fountain."
4323,BOOK II.,"Orlando, determined to resist this chastisement, turns upon his"
4324,BOOK II.,tormentor; but might as well seek to wound the wind. Convinced at
4325,BOOK II.,"last of the shadowy nature of his persecutor, and observing that"
4326,BOOK II.,"Morgana gained upon him, while he was thus hopelessly engaged, he"
4327,BOOK II.,determines to pursue the fairy without being diverted by the
4328,BOOK II.,molestation of Penitence.
4329,BOOK II.,
4330,BOOK II.,"Chasing Morgana, then, over rock and hill, he made sundry snatches"
4331,BOOK II.,"at her white and vermilion garments, which still eluded his grasp."
4332,BOOK II.,"On the fairy, however, turning her head for an instant, he"
4333,BOOK II.,"profited by the chance, and seized her by the forelock. In an"
4334,BOOK II.,"instant the tempest ceased, the sky became serene, and Penitence"
4335,BOOK II.,retreated into her cave.
4336,BOOK II.,
4337,BOOK II.,Orlando now demanded of Morgana the keys of her dungeon; and the
4338,BOOK II.,"fairy, feigning a complacent aspect, told him that these were at"
4339,BOOK II.,"his disposal; entreating him, though he should free all her other"
4340,BOOK II.,"prisoners, to leave her a youthful son of Monodontes, who was her"
4341,BOOK II.,"darling. Orlando consented to this, and the fairy delivered up a"
4342,BOOK II.,"key of silver, bidding him be cautious in the use of it; since, to"
4343,BOOK II.,"break the lock, would be to involve himself and all, in inevitable"
4344,BOOK II.,destruction; a caution which gave the count room for long
4345,BOOK II.,"meditation, and led him to consider"
4346,BOOK II.,
4347,BOOK II.,"How few amid the suitors, who importune"
4348,BOOK II.,"The dame, know how to guide the keys of Fortune."
4349,BOOK II.,
4350,BOOK II.,"Keeping the fairy still fast by the forelock, Orlando proceeded"
4351,BOOK II.,"towards the prison, turned the key without occasioning the"
4352,BOOK II.,"mischief apprehended, and delivered the prisoners."
4353,BOOK II.,
4354,BOOK II.,"Amongst these were Brandimart, Rinaldo, and all the knights,"
4355,BOOK II.,"baptized or infidel, who had been taken at the bridge. The only"
4356,BOOK II.,"unhappy person amid this joyous band was Ziliantes, the minion of"
4357,BOOK II.,"Morgana. This youth remained behind weeping; and time will come,"
4358,BOOK II.,"says the author, when Orlando will repent of having yielded to the"
4359,BOOK II.,entreaties of the fairy.
4360,BOOK II.,
4361,BOOK II.,"The others, now delivered from their captivity, together with"
4362,BOOK II.,"Orlando, ascending a lofty stair issued into the field of"
4363,BOOK II.,"treasure, where was to be seen the king and his court, all"
4364,BOOK II.,"composed of the richest materials in the world. Rinaldo, on"
4365,BOOK II.,"finding himself amid this mass of wealth, could not resist the"
4366,BOOK II.,"temptation of seizing a gold seat that stood in his way, which, he"
4367,BOOK II.,"observed, would feed his hungry garrison of Mont Albano. This he"
4368,BOOK II.,"was bearing off, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Orlando,"
4369,BOOK II.,when a violent wind blew him back as often as he approached the
4370,BOOK II.,"gate, by which they were retiring. Rinaldo at length yielded to"
4371,BOOK II.,"necessity, rather than to the entreaties of his comrades, and cast"
4372,BOOK II.,"away his prize. All now climbing another immeasurable stair,"
4373,BOOK II.,"ascended into the upper world, and found themselves in the field"
4374,BOOK II.,decorated with their arms.
4375,BOOK II.,
4376,BOOK II.,Here each knight resumed his own; and all except the paladins and
4377,BOOK II.,"their friends, separated, as their inclinations or duty prompted."
4378,BOOK II.,It was now that Dudon informed the cousins that he had been made
4379,BOOK II.,"prisoner by Morgana, when in the discharge of an embassy to them"
4380,BOOK II.,"from Charlemagne, who called upon them to return to the defence of"
4381,BOOK II.,"Christendom. Orlando is too much fascinated by Angelica, to obey"
4382,BOOK II.,"this summons; and, followed by the faithful Brandimart, returns"
4383,BOOK II.,"towards Albracca. Rinaldo, accompanied by Dudon, Iroldo and"
4384,BOOK II.,"Prasildo, takes his way towards the west."
4385,BOOK II.,
4386,BOOK II.,"These, though unprovided with horses, (for their coursers were"
4387,BOOK II.,"lost at the bridge,) went laughing and talking on their way. Their"
4388,BOOK II.,"journey was without adventures till the sixth day, when they heard"
4389,BOOK II.,a horn sound from a neighbouring castle. From this they were
4390,BOOK II.,"divided by a river, and near the opposite bank was a small bark,"
4391,BOOK II.,"with a damsel in the stern, who proffered them a passage."
4392,BOOK II.,
4393,BOOK II.,"Arrived on the other shore, she tells them they must account for"
4394,BOOK II.,"this with the warder, who was then approaching. This was an old"
4395,BOOK II.,"man mounted on a heavy steed, and surrounded by a numerous escort."
4396,BOOK II.,"He informs the knights, that they are upon the territory of the"
4397,BOOK II.,"king Monodontes, from which they will not be suffered to depart,"
4398,BOOK II.,before they have rendered him a day's service. This was to avenge
4399,BOOK II.,"him of a certain enemy named Balisardo, at once a giant and"
4400,BOOK II.,"enchanter, who kept a bridge, flanked with towers, near the mouth"
4401,BOOK II.,"of the river which they had crossed, and who had put many scorns"
4402,BOOK II.,upon that monarch and those who travelled to his realm.
4403,BOOK II.,
4404,BOOK II.,"Nothing more agreeable could have been proposed to the warriors,"
4405,BOOK II.,and they reimbark in the damsel's skiff for the purpose of seeking
4406,BOOK II.,the necromancer.
4407,BOOK II.,
4408,BOOK II.,"The event of the combat was, however, very different from what"
4409,BOOK II.,"they had anticipated. Encountering the giant singly, they all"
4410,BOOK II.,"became the victims of his enchantments, and were cast into his"
4411,BOOK II.,"dungeons, already peopled with illustrious knights, amongst whom"
4412,BOOK II.,was Astolpho of England.
4413,BOOK II.,
4414,BOOK II.,"This prince, in company with the two damsels before mentioned, had"
4415,BOOK II.,"gone about the world, with Bayardo and Rabican, weeping the loss"
4416,BOOK II.,"of Rinaldo, whom he saw go to the bottom of the enchanted lake"
4417,BOOK II.,"with Arridano. Wandering thence, he had arrived on the same spot"
4418,BOOK II.,where Rinaldo and his comrades afterwards found themselves; like
4419,BOOK II.,"them he had ferried the river in the damsel's boat, like them, had"
4420,BOOK II.,"been dispatched against Balisardo; and, like them, had been made"
4421,BOOK II.,"prisoner by the wizard, who ensnared him, under the form of a"
4422,BOOK II.,damsel.
4423,BOOK II.,
4424,BOOK II.,"In the mean time, Orlando, who had parted company with Rinaldo,"
4425,BOOK II.,"and the rest, was returning, with Brandimart, towards Albracca On"
4426,BOOK II.,"his way thither he, to his surprise, saw Marphisa in chase of"
4427,BOOK II.,"Brunello, and contemplating the two, was himself robbed of his"
4428,BOOK II.,"horn, and Balisarda."
4429,BOOK II.,
4430,BOOK II.,"As both he and Brandimart were on foot, to chase the robber was"
4431,BOOK II.,"useless; leaving, therefore, Marphisa still in pursuit, the two"
4432,BOOK II.,"warriors proceeded on their way. Pursuing this, they too arrived"
4433,BOOK II.,"at the same ferry as Rinaldo had, and there found two damsels"
4434,BOOK II.,"assailing each other with reproaches, the one in a boat, and the"
4435,BOOK II.,other on horseback. Orlando immediately recognized the latter for
4436,BOOK II.,"Origilla, who had stolen Brigliadoro and Durindana, previous to"
4437,BOOK II.,"his entering the garden of Orgagna. His resentment, however, was"
4438,BOOK II.,forgotten on seeing her; and he received her again into his
4439,BOOK II.,"company, embarking, as the others had done, for the adventure of"
4440,BOOK II.,Balisardo.
4441,BOOK II.,
4442,BOOK II.,"In this his usual fortune deserted him, and having been vanquished"
4443,BOOK II.,"by the enchantments of the giant, he was cast on board a miserable"
4444,BOOK II.,"prison-ship, in order to be transported to some distant dungeons."
4445,BOOK II.,
4446,BOOK II.,"From this he is, however, delivered by the valour of Brandimart*,"
4447,BOOK II.,"who slays the giant, and rescues Orlando from captivity. The two"
4448,BOOK II.,champions now interrogate the master of the prison-ship; who tells
4449,BOOK II.,"them that the wizard-giant was the instrument of a certain king,"
4450,BOOK II.,"called Monodontes, who dwelt in Damogir, an island situated in the"
4451,BOOK II.,"ocean; where he had amassed riches, which surpassed the"
4452,BOOK II.,"imagination to conceive. As, something is always wanting to the"
4453,BOOK II.,"completion of human happiness, this prince was miserable in the"
4454,BOOK II.,"loss of his two only sons, the first of whom was carried off, in"
4455,BOOK II.,"his childhood, by a slave of the name of Bardino, and the second"
4456,BOOK II.,"taken and imprisoned by a fairy named Morgana, who was said to be"
4457,BOOK II.,enamoured of the youth.
4458,BOOK II.,
4459,BOOK II.,"* The reader will have remarked that a vein of allegory, more or"
4460,BOOK II.,"less apparent, runs through the whole of the romance. This"
4461,BOOK II.,"observation will, perhaps, serve to explain the defeat of Orlando,"
4462,BOOK II.,"and the subsequent triumph of Brandimart. Orlando, by his love of"
4463,BOOK II.,"vice, as figured in Origilla, has derogated from his natural self,"
4464,BOOK II.,"and forfeited the protection of Providence, while Brandimart, the"
4465,BOOK II.,"model of purity and constancy, is proof against all the powers of"
4466,BOOK II.,hell.
4467,BOOK II.,
4468,BOOK II.,"The ship-master, pursuing his story, stated that the fairy had"
4469,BOOK II.,"offered to surrender the stripling to his father, upon his putting"
4470,BOOK II.,"her in possession of a certain knight, entitled Orlando, with whom"
4471,BOOK II.,"she was at enmity, on account of his having destroyed her"
4472,BOOK II.,"enchantments. This the necromancer, overcome by Brandimart, had"
4473,BOOK II.,"offered to effect for Monodontes, but had never succeeded, though"
4474,BOOK II.,he had crowded his dungeons with champions; amongst whom were
4475,BOOK II.,"Rinaldo, Astolpho, Dudon, Gryphon and Aquilant, and others, too"
4476,BOOK II.,many to mention.
4477,BOOK II.,
4478,BOOK II.,"Orlando listened to the narration in silence: then, after some"
4479,BOOK II.,"secret conference with the ship-master, bade him make sail for"
4480,BOOK II.,"Damogir, as he and Brandimart were now masters of the vessel, for"
4481,BOOK II.,he was minded to put this Orlando into the hands of Monodontes. He
4482,BOOK II.,"obeys his command, and the ship, after traversing the ocean,"
4483,BOOK II.,arrives with them at the island.
4484,BOOK II.,
4485,BOOK II.,"Here the proposal was renewed by the knights, and accepted by"
4486,BOOK II.,"Monodontes; who, waiting the accomplishment of their promise,"
4487,BOOK II.,lodged them in a magnificent palace near his own. Here too was
4488,BOOK II.,"guested the infamous Origilla, who was privy to Orlando's design."
4489,BOOK II.,"She having her mind entirely set upon Gryphon, who (it will be"
4490,BOOK II.,"remembered) was amongst the prisoners of Monodontes, and thinking"
4491,BOOK II.,"she was possessed of sure means of delivering him, secretly"
4492,BOOK II.,"presented herself before the king, and informed him that Orlando"
4493,BOOK II.,was in his power.
4494,BOOK II.,
4495,BOOK II.,"As the covenanted reward of her service, Monodontes ordered"
4496,BOOK II.,"Gryphon to be delivered up to her; and he refusing freedom, unless"
4497,BOOK II.,"Aquilant was at the same time freed, both were set at liberty, and"
4498,BOOK II.,departed with Origilla.
4499,BOOK II.,
4500,BOOK II.,To take Orlando was a more difficult enterprise; but this was
4501,BOOK II.,"accomplished through the means of a potion, by which both he and"
4502,BOOK II.,"Brandimart were put to sleep, and, while stupefied by the liquor,"
4503,BOOK II.,lodged in the dungeons of Monodontes. In the solitude of their
4504,BOOK II.,prison Orlando converts Brandimart to the Christian faith; and
4505,BOOK II.,"this knight, who appears to be the type of friendship and virtuous"
4506,BOOK II.,"love, upon the guards of the monarch coming in search of Orlando,"
4507,BOOK II.,"announces himself as the person sought for, and as such presents"
4508,BOOK II.,himself to Monodontes.
4509,BOOK II.,
4510,BOOK II.,"This monarch tells Brandimart, whom he imagines to be Orlando,"
4511,BOOK II.,that he seeks the liberation of his son Ziliantes; and as he knows
4512,BOOK II.,"no method of obtaining him from the fairy, but by such a"
4513,BOOK II.,"sacrifice, is reluctantly compelled to offer him in exchange for"
4514,BOOK II.,"the royal captive. To which Brandimart replies, that if he only"
4515,BOOK II.,"seeks this, he may obtain his end without such a breach of"
4516,BOOK II.,"hospitality, as his comrade is ready to descend to the dungeons of"
4517,BOOK II.,"Morgana, where he has already been, and rescue him by force. That"
4518,BOOK II.,"in the meantime he will remain as his hostage, and if he whom he"
4519,BOOK II.,"is to free does not, within a month, return with Ziliantes, the"
4520,BOOK II.,"king can, at the worst, accomplish the deliverance of his son, by"
4521,BOOK II.,giving him up (the king believing him to be Orlando) to the
4522,BOOK II.,vengeance of Morgana.
4523,BOOK II.,
4524,BOOK II.,"Monodontes accedes to this proposal, and the real Orlando is"
4525,BOOK II.,suffered to depart.
4526,BOOK II.,
4527,BOOK II.,"In the meantime Brandimart, always under the name of Orlando,"
4528,BOOK II.,remains for some time a prisoner at large; when the secret is
4529,BOOK II.,"discovered, through the indiscretion of Astolpho, and Monodontes"
4530,BOOK II.,"in fury orders Brandimart to be cast into a dungeon, preparatory"
4531,BOOK II.,to his expiating his imposture by death. Orlando this while is
4532,BOOK II.,"bound upon his adventure, and arriving at the lake formerly kept"
4533,BOOK II.,"by Arridano, finds upon its banks a beautiful lady weeping over a"
4534,BOOK II.,dead dragon.
4535,BOOK II.,
4536,BOOK II.,"While Orlando contemplates this spectacle with surprise, the lady"
4537,BOOK II.,"snatches up the dragon in her arms, and embarks with it in a"
4538,BOOK II.,"little pinnace, which was moored hard by. She now loosens from the"
4539,BOOK II.,"shore, sets her sail, and having reached the middle of the lake,"
4540,BOOK II.,sinks to the bottom with her enchanted barque.
4541,BOOK II.,
4542,BOOK II.,"Orlando was yet absorbed in wonder at what he had witnessed, when"
4543,BOOK II.,"another damsel arrived upon the bank, mounted on a palfrey, and"
4544,BOOK II.,"accompanied by a single sergeant, who called upon the count by"
4545,BOOK II.,"name, and expressed the greatest pleasure at his sight."
4546,BOOK II.,
4547,BOOK II.,"This damsel was no other than Flordelis, the lady-love of"
4548,BOOK II.,"Brandimart; the damsel of the barque, it will be easily divined,"
4549,BOOK II.,was Morgana.
4550,BOOK II.,
4551,BOOK II.,"This fairy, upon the departure of Orlando from her enchanted"
4552,BOOK II.,"garden, transformed Ziliantes, by the aid of certain witcheries,"
4553,BOOK II.,"into a dragon, meaning that he should supply the place of Arridano"
4554,BOOK II.,"and keep the avenues of her territory. Whether, however, from some"
4555,BOOK II.,"error in her enchantments or other cause, the transformation was"
4556,BOOK II.,no sooner completed than the youth uttered a shriek and expired.
4557,BOOK II.,"Hence the fairy, distracted with her loss, had embarked with him"
4558,BOOK II.,"in the pinnace, and descended to the bottom of the lake, in the"
4559,BOOK II.,hope of re-animating him in her world below.
4560,BOOK II.,
4561,BOOK II.,"As soon as Flordelis, who was immediately recognised by the count,"
4562,BOOK II.,"had set eyes upon him, she conjured him to lend her his"
4563,BOOK II.,"assistance; and, that he might understand for what purpose,"
4564,BOOK II.,"entreated him to listen to her story, which she began in the"
4565,BOOK II.,following words.
4566,BOOK II.,
4567,BOOK II.,"""I was wandering in search of Brandimart, when I fell in with the"
4568,BOOK II.,"sergeant, whom you see with me; and who, by a strange fortune,"
4569,BOOK II.,turned out to be one who was also in search of him. His story was
4570,BOOK II.,yet more extraordinary than the accident which brought us
4571,BOOK II.,"together, and is the cause of my present distress. He informed me"
4572,BOOK II.,"that he was formerly a slave of the king Monodontes, and named"
4573,BOOK II.,"Bardino; who, to avenge himself upon the monarch for some wrong,"
4574,BOOK II.,"conveyed away from him his eldest son, and sold him to the lord of"
4575,BOOK II.,"the Sylvan Tower; who conceived such fondness for him, that he"
4576,BOOK II.,"brought him up as his son, and dying, left him his possessions."
4577,BOOK II.,
4578,BOOK II.,"""His love of arms, however, carried him away from the Tower, of"
4579,BOOK II.,which he had made Bardino castellan; and this was attacked by a
4580,BOOK II.,"neighbour named Rupardo, in his absence, with such forces as"
4581,BOOK II.,"rendered a defence hopeless. Under these circumstances Bardino,"
4582,BOOK II.,"had cast lots to learn the fate of Brandimart, and found that he"
4583,BOOK II.,"was prisoner to Morgana. Hence it is,"" pursued the damsel, ""that I"
4584,BOOK II.,entreat you to lend your assistance to recover him from her
4585,BOOK II.,"power."""
4586,BOOK II.,
4587,BOOK II.,"Orlando related in return what had since happened to Brandimart,"
4588,BOOK II.,"and, lastly, how he had left him in the power of Monodontes,"
4589,BOOK II.,"meaning to redeem him, by the recovery of Ziliantes, from the"
4590,BOOK II.,prisons of Morgana.
4591,BOOK II.,
4592,BOOK II.,"The damsel heard Orlando's recital with gratitude, and, throwing"
4593,BOOK II.,"herself on her knees, prayed devoutly for the success of his"
4594,BOOK II.,undertaking.
4595,BOOK II.,
4596,BOOK II.,He immediately entered upon his adventure. Descending by the
4597,BOOK II.,"entrance, through which he had formerly ascended into the upper"
4598,BOOK II.,"air, and which he remembered, though concealed by briars and"
4599,BOOK II.,"thorns, he again traversed the field of treasure, and saw the"
4600,BOOK II.,"golden seat, lying in the very place where Rinaldo had been"
4601,BOOK II.,obliged to abandon it.
4602,BOOK II.,
4603,BOOK II.,"Thus pursuing his old path, he came upon Morgana near the"
4604,BOOK II.,"fountain, where he had formerly found her disporting herself."
4605,BOOK II.,
4606,BOOK II.,"She was this time engaged in a very different occupation, and was"
4607,BOOK II.,"caressing Ziliantes, who had now resumed the human form, but"
4608,BOOK II.,"remained yet pale, and terrified by the effects of the"
4609,BOOK II.,"metamorphose. The count does not again neglect his opportunity,"
4610,BOOK II.,"but, seizing the fairy by the forelock, compels her to abandon her"
4611,BOOK II.,prisoner. Orlando returning into light with Ziliantes by the
4612,BOOK II.,"ancient staircase, finds Flordelis yet engaged in prayer, and now"
4613,BOOK II.,"all journeying to the coast, which was near, and embarking upon"
4614,BOOK II.,"the ocean, arrive safely at Damogir."
4615,BOOK II.,
4616,BOOK II.,"The delight of Monodontes at the recovery of his two sons, when he"
4617,BOOK II.,"had despaired of even retrieving Ziliantes, may be easily"
4618,BOOK II.,"imagined: king and people become Christians; Rinaldo, Astolpho,"
4619,BOOK II.,"Dudon, and the other prisoners are set at liberty; all is"
4620,BOOK II.,"festivity, and the offence of Bardino is forgiven, in consequence"
4621,BOOK II.,of his subsequent attachment to Brandimart. To complete the
4622,BOOK II.,"general joy, a lady arrives at this period, who is recognized as"
4623,BOOK II.,the daughter of Monodontes and the damsel of the golden apples.
4624,BOOK II.,
4625,BOOK II.,But human life is chequered by light and shade. The long continued
4626,BOOK II.,"festivities of Damogir are broken in upon by Dudon the Dane, who"
4627,BOOK II.,reminds the princes of their obligation to hurry to the defence of
4628,BOOK II.,Christendom.
4629,BOOK II.,
4630,BOOK II.,"Rinaldo and all the Franks obey the summons, with the exception of"
4631,BOOK II.,"Orlando; who, accompanied by Brandimart, his inseparable"
4632,BOOK II.,"companion, returns towards Albracca. In the meantime Rinaldo,"
4633,BOOK II.,"Iroldo, Prasildo, and the others, with Astolpho in the midst,"
4634,BOOK II.,"armed with his lance of gold, set forward on their return to"
4635,BOOK II.,France.
4636,BOOK II.,
4637,BOOK II.,"Travelling thus, north about, into Europe, the knights found"
4638,BOOK II.,themselves one morning in front of a beautiful castle and garden
4639,BOOK II.,"on the sea-shore. This was the domain of Alcina, sister of"
4640,BOOK II.,"Morgana, and queen of the Atarberi. The fay herself was standing"
4641,BOOK II.,"on the beach, and amusing herself with taking fish, which she"
4642,BOOK II.,inveigled by her enchantments.
4643,BOOK II.,
4644,BOOK II.,"She herself was ensnared by the beauties of Astolpho, whom she"
4645,BOOK II.,"invited to pass into a neighbouring island, in order to hear the"
4646,BOOK II.,music of a syren who frequented it.
4647,BOOK II.,
4648,BOOK II.,"Astolpho crosses on horseback into the island, which lay close to"
4649,BOOK II.,"the shore; but this is in motion as soon as he reaches it, and"
4650,BOOK II.,"proves to be a large whale, which was a minister of the fairy."
4651,BOOK II.,"Rinaldo and Dudon instantly swim off to his assistance, but the"
4652,BOOK II.,"horse of Dudon sinking with his rider, Rinaldo is compelled to"
4653,BOOK II.,"swim Bayardo to the relief of the Dane, whom he succeeds in"
4654,BOOK II.,"bringing to shore. Meantime the whale floats out of sight, and a"
4655,BOOK II.,terrible tempest obscures both sky and ocean
4656,BOOK II.,
4657,BOOK II.,"To succour Astolpho was now impossible, and the confederated"
4658,BOOK II.,champions continued their journey to the westward.
4659,BOOK II.,
4660,BOOK II.,"Pursuing this, they at last arrived at Buda in Hungary, whence the"
4661,BOOK II.,king of that country was dispatching his son Ottachiero with a
4662,BOOK II.,large army to the succour of Charlemagne. Delighted with the
4663,BOOK II.,"arrival of Rinaldo, he placed his son and troops under this"
4664,BOOK II.,"conduct, and these having, after long and distant marches, united"
4665,BOOK II.,"themselves with the troops of Desiderius king of Lombardy, passed"
4666,BOOK II.,"the Genovese Alps, and poured down into Provence."
4667,BOOK II.,
4668,BOOK II.,The confederate armies had not marched many days through this gay
4669,BOOK II.,"tract, before they heard a crash of drums and trumpets behind the"
4670,BOOK II.,"hills, which spoke the conflict between the paynims, led by"
4671,BOOK II.,"Rodomont, and the Christian forces."
4672,BOOK II.,
4673,BOOK II.,"Rinaldo, witnessing from a mountain the prowess of Rodomont,"
4674,BOOK II.,"leaves his troops in charge of his friends, and gallops towards"
4675,BOOK II.,"him with his lance in the rest. The impulse is irresistible, and"
4676,BOOK II.,"Rodomont is unhorsed. Rinaldo, however, in a high spirit of"
4677,BOOK II.,"chivalry, gallops back to the hill from which he had descended,"
4678,BOOK II.,"secures Bayardo amongst the baggage, and returns to pursue the"
4679,BOOK II.,combat with his former antagonist on foot.
4680,BOOK II.,
4681,BOOK II.,"During this interval the battle had become general, the Hungarians"
4682,BOOK II.,"were routed by Rodomont, and Rinaldo, on his return, had the"
4683,BOOK II.,"mortification to find that Ottachiero was wounded, and Dudon a"
4684,BOOK II.,prisoner.
4685,BOOK II.,
4686,BOOK II.,"He now again engages Rodomont; when in the midst of their strife,"
4687,BOOK II.,"a new sound of drums and trumpets was heard, and the army of"
4688,BOOK II.,Charlemagne was descried advancing in battalia.
4689,BOOK II.,
4690,BOOK II.,"Rodomont, who had in the meantime mounted the horse of Dudon,"
4691,BOOK II.,"leaves Rinaldo, who was on foot, and gallops to the attack of the"
4692,BOOK II.,"enemy. A desperate battle ensues, but night separates the"
4693,BOOK II.,combatants.
4694,BOOK II.,
4695,BOOK II.,"Rodomont now thinks only of Rinaldo, and deceived by a false"
4696,BOOK II.,"report, sets off in pursuit of him towards the forest of Arden."
4697,BOOK II.,
4698,BOOK II.,"Rinaldo, however, having this time gone in search of Bayardo, was"
4699,BOOK II.,"returning towards the field upon that courser, when he fell in"
4700,BOOK II.,"with the Saracens, engaged in carrying aboard their ships the"
4701,BOOK II.,"plunder, and the prisoners made in battle. Some of these had"
4702,BOOK II.,"already sailed for Africa with Dudon, while Rinaldo, still seeking"
4703,BOOK II.,"Rodomont, makes a tremendous carnage among the rest."
4704,BOOK II.,
4705,BOOK II.,"He at last learns that his adversary, following a false scent, is"
4706,BOOK II.,"gone towards Merlin's fountain, in the forest of Arden, when he"
4707,BOOK II.,"quits the pursuit of the Saracens, in order to follow him."
4708,BOOK II.,
4709,BOOK II.,"Rodomont was in the meantime far advanced upon his way, when he"
4710,BOOK II.,"fell in with a strange cavalier, that proved to be Ferrau, who"
4711,BOOK II.,"had, it seems, returned to France, in search of Angelica. The two"
4712,BOOK II.,"knights mixing in conversation, their talk, according to the"
4713,BOOK II.,"practice of chivalry, turned upon love, when Ferrau spoke of"
4714,BOOK II.,"Doralice, daughter of Stordilano, king of Granada, as a lady to"
4715,BOOK II.,"whom he had been a suitor. Rodomont, kindling at this, avowed his"
4716,BOOK II.,"passion for her, declared he would bear with no rival in his love,"
4717,BOOK II.,"and bade him resign all pretensions to her, or take his ground and"
4718,BOOK II.,"defend himself. Ferrau replied, that he had loved her and left"
4719,BOOK II.,her; but that he would now love her in his despite.
4720,BOOK II.,
4721,BOOK II.,"A duel ensues, but the author leaves the knights engaged, in order"
4722,BOOK II.,"to pursue the story of Rinaldo. He, still seeking his pursuer,"
4723,BOOK II.,"Rodomont, misses him, whilst he is engaged in combat with Ferrau;"
4724,BOOK II.,"and wandering into a sylvan lawn, in the middle of the forest of"
4725,BOOK II.,"Arden, is surprised by the vision of a beautiful child, dancing"
4726,BOOK II.,"naked, with three damsels, as naked and as beautiful as himself."
4727,BOOK II.,"While he is lost in admiration at the sight, the child approaches"
4728,BOOK II.,"him, and smiting on his helmet with a bunch of roses and lilies,"
4729,BOOK II.,strikes him from his horse. He is no sooner down than he is seized
4730,BOOK II.,"by the dancers, by whom he is dragged about and scourged with"
4731,BOOK II.,flowers till he falls into a swoon. While he is yet absorbed in
4732,BOOK II.,"this, one of the group approaches him, who says her name is"
4733,BOOK II.,Pasiphae; that his punishment is the consequence of his rebellion
4734,BOOK II.,"against that power, before whom every thing bends; and that there"
4735,BOOK II.,is but one remedy that can heal the wounds which have been
4736,BOOK II.,"inflicted; and this is, to drink of the waters of Love."
4737,BOOK II.,
4738,BOOK II.,"Rinaldo, sore and faint, drags himself into the neighbouring wood,"
4739,BOOK II.,"and being parched with thirst, drinks greedily, and almost"
4740,BOOK II.,"unconsciously, of a spring which he finds there. After repeated"
4741,BOOK II.,"draughts of the water, which is sweet to the taste, but bitter at"
4742,BOOK II.,"the heart, he recovers his strength and recollection, and finds"
4743,BOOK II.,himself in the same place where Angelica had formerly awakened him
4744,BOOK II.,"with a rain of flowers, and whence he had fled in contempt of her"
4745,BOOK II.,courtesy.
4746,BOOK II.,
4747,BOOK II.,His remembrance of the scene is followed by the recognition of his
4748,BOOK II.,"crime; and, repenting bitterly of his ingratitude, he leaps upon"
4749,BOOK II.,"Bayardo with the intention of following Angelica to India, and"
4750,BOOK II.,soliciting his pardon at her feet. He has not ridden far with this
4751,BOOK II.,"intention, when he beholds, at a distance, a damsel mounted upon a"
4752,BOOK II.,"palfrey, attended by a cavalier who bore a burning mountain for"
4753,BOOK II.,"his device: but, before explaining who were the damsel and knight,"
4754,BOOK II.,"the author returns to Marphisa, lately left in pursuit of"
4755,BOOK II.,Brunello.
4756,BOOK II.,
4757,BOOK II.,She had now hunted him for fifteen days. Her horse had sunk under
4758,BOOK II.,"her during the chase; and she had cast away her arms, to be the"
4759,BOOK II.,better able to pursue him.
4760,BOOK II.,
4761,BOOK II.,Her pains were thrown away. Brunello arrived before her at the
4762,BOOK II.,"sea-side, and finding a vessel ready to sail, embarked, and"
4763,BOOK II.,"arrived at Biserta, in Africa. Here he found Agramant, who was"
4764,BOOK II.,"impatient for the ring, which was to foil the enchantments of"
4765,BOOK II.,"Atlantes and to put Rogero into his hands. The dwarf, now kneeling"
4766,BOOK II.,"before the king, related his story, and presented him with the"
4767,BOOK II.,"ring of Angelica, and the horn stolen from Orlando; when Agramant,"
4768,BOOK II.,"delighted at the success of his mission, crowned him, in"
4769,BOOK II.,"recompense, king of Tingitana."
4770,BOOK II.,
4771,BOOK II.,"All are now anxious to go in quest of Rogero, nor will Brunello be"
4772,BOOK II.,"left behind. The cavalcade accordingly departs, and having"
4773,BOOK II.,"traversed the Great Desert, arrives at the mountain of Carena."
4774,BOOK II.,
4775,BOOK II.,"At the bottom of this was a fruitful and well-wooded plain,"
4776,BOOK II.,"watered by a large river, which traversed it in its way to the"
4777,BOOK II.,sea; and from this plain was descried a beautiful garden on the
4778,BOOK II.,"mountain-top, which contained the mansion of Atlantes: but the"
4779,BOOK II.,"ring, which discovered what was before invisible, could not,"
4780,BOOK II.,"though it revealed this paradise, enable Agramant or his followers"
4781,BOOK II.,"to enter it. So steep and smooth was the rock by nature, that none"
4782,BOOK II.,could scale it; and even Brunello was obliged to renounce the
4783,BOOK II.,"attempt. He did not, however, for this, despair of accomplishing"
4784,BOOK II.,"the object of the enterprise; and, having obtained Agramant's"
4785,BOOK II.,"approbation, caused the assembled courtiers and knights to"
4786,BOOK II.,celebrate a tournament upon the plain below. This was done with
4787,BOOK II.,"the view of seducing Rogero from his fastness, and the stratagem"
4788,BOOK II.,was attended with success.
4789,BOOK II.,
4790,BOOK II.,"Rogero joins the tourney, presented by Brunello with Sacripant's"
4791,BOOK II.,"horse, Frontilatte, (whose name is afterwards changed into"
4792,BOOK II.,"Frontino,) and with Balisarda, the sword of Orlando. In the medley"
4793,BOOK II.,"he is treacherously wounded, but avenges himself of the traitor;"
4794,BOOK II.,"and, returning to the summit of the mountain, is healed by the"
4795,BOOK II.,"skill and attention of Atlantes, having previously learned from"
4796,BOOK II.,Brunello the preparations which were making for the invasion of
4797,BOOK II.,"France, and having indeed received his horse and arms, as an"
4798,BOOK II.,earnest for his service in the expedition.
4799,BOOK II.,
4800,BOOK II.,"The author now leaves him again on the mountain of Carena, to"
4801,BOOK II.,accompany Orlando and Brandimart.
4802,BOOK II.,
4803,BOOK II.,"These two, having separated from Rinaldo, Astolpho, and the rest,"
4804,BOOK II.,"were pursuing their journey through India, when they found"
4805,BOOK II.,"themselves near a stone, situated by a fountain, where sate a"
4806,BOOK II.,"lady, having her eyes fixed upon the ground, while a bridge, which"
4807,BOOK II.,"divided two roads hard by, was kept by an armed knight."
4808,BOOK II.,
4809,BOOK II.,"While Orlando and Brandimart were engaged in a friendly contest,"
4810,BOOK II.,"who should first encounter him, a pilgrim advanced towards the"
4811,BOOK II.,"bridge, notwithstanding the prohibition of him who kept it; and"
4812,BOOK II.,"finding that the knight approached in order to enforce his threat,"
4813,BOOK II.,"cast off his pilgrim's slough, and showed that he was armed cap-à-pe."
4814,BOOK II.,"A fierce combat now ensued, between him and the warder of the"
4815,BOOK II.,"bridge, whom both Brandimart and Orlando thought they had seen"
4816,BOOK II.,"before, but could not recognise, through the strangeness of his"
4817,BOOK II.,disguise. In this strife the pilgrim at last succeeded in making
4818,BOOK II.,"the warder give ground, and retire slowly from his post."
4819,BOOK II.,
4820,BOOK II.,"On the other side of the bridge, and near the fountain which"
4821,BOOK II.,"formed the stream, was a monument, which an inscription proclaimed"
4822,BOOK II.,to be the sepulchre of Narcissus.
4823,BOOK II.,
4824,BOOK II.,"Contemplating himself in the neighbouring fountain, he had pined"
4825,BOOK II.,away; and his death was productive of new calamities. The fairy
4826,BOOK II.,"Silvanella, as her evil destiny would have it, passing near the"
4827,BOOK II.,"body, fell in love with the dead youth, whom she entombed in this"
4828,BOOK II.,"mausoleum of alabaster. Here, too, consumed by hopeless passion,"
4829,BOOK II.,"_she_ perished, and left this dying curse upon the waters; that"
4830,BOOK II.,who contemplated them should see pourtrayed there such a vision of
4831,BOOK II.,"beauty, that they should become incapable of departing from the"
4832,BOOK II.,place.
4833,BOOK II.,
4834,BOOK II.,"Many, who had arrived upon the banks of the river, in consequence"
4835,BOOK II.,"of her malediction, remained gazing upon the stream, till they"
4836,BOOK II.,"expired. Among these was the gentle king Larbino, who came there"
4837,BOOK II.,"with his leman Calidora, who remained inconsolable for his loss,"
4838,BOOK II.,"and took up her dwelling in the meadow, where he died. This is"
4839,BOOK II.,"she, who sits weeping by the water-side, and whose champion"
4840,BOOK II.,maintains the bridge against all comers.
4841,BOOK II.,
4842,BOOK II.,"And such was the tale she told Orlando, whom she conjured, in"
4843,BOOK II.,"favour of her pious intentions, to aid her cavalier, hard pressed"
4844,BOOK II.,by the pilgrim.
4845,BOOK II.,
4846,BOOK II.,"Orlando, moved by her prayer, thrust himself between the"
4847,BOOK II.,"combatants, whom he separated, and recognized one for Sacripant,"
4848,BOOK II.,and the other for Isoliero. Isoliero had accompanied the lady from
4849,BOOK II.,"Spain to India, for the purpose of rendering her this service; and"
4850,BOOK II.,"Sacripant had been dispatched (as was said) by Angelica, to king"
4851,BOOK II.,"Gradasso, for assistance, towards whose kingdom he was now upon"
4852,BOOK II.,his way.
4853,BOOK II.,
4854,BOOK II.,When the count had learned from this monarch the object of his
4855,BOOK II.,"journey, and the peril of Angelica, he fled with Brandimart, from"
4856,BOOK II.,"the dangerous water, mindful of the fate of those that had"
4857,BOOK II.,"perished there; leaving Isoliero, who had been severely wounded by"
4858,BOOK II.,"Sacripant, in the company of Calidora."
4859,BOOK II.,
4860,BOOK II.,"While Orlando took his way to Albracca, Sacripant took up the"
4861,BOOK II.,"pilgrim's garb and staff, and pursued his towards the kingdom of"
4862,BOOK II.,Gradasso.
4863,BOOK II.,
4864,BOOK II.,"Orlando, arriving before Albracca, finds it closely beleaguered."
4865,BOOK II.,"He, however, makes his way into the citadel, and relates his"
4866,BOOK II.,"adventures to Angelica, from the time of his departure, up to his"
4867,BOOK II.,"separation from Rinaldo and the rest, when they departed to the"
4868,BOOK II.,"assistance of Charlemagne. Angelica, in return, described the"
4869,BOOK II.,"distresses of the garrison, and the force of the besiegers; and in"
4870,BOOK II.,"conclusion, prayed Orlando to favour her escape from the pressing"
4871,BOOK II.,"danger, and escort her into France. Orlando, who did not suspect"
4872,BOOK II.,"that love for Rinaldo, who had returned thither, was her secret"
4873,BOOK II.,"motive, joyfully agreed to the proposal, and the sally was"
4874,BOOK II.,resolved.
4875,BOOK II.,
4876,BOOK II.,"Leaving lights burning in the fortress, they departed at night-fall,"
4877,BOOK II.,and passed in safety through the enemy's camp. On the
4878,BOOK II.,"ensuing day, however, the besiegers discovered the deceit, stormed"
4879,BOOK II.,"and sacked the citadel, and then pursued the deserters."
4880,BOOK II.,
4881,BOOK II.,"Of these, Orlando went first, escorting Angelica and Flordelis,"
4882,BOOK II.,while Brandimart covered their retreat. In consequence of this
4883,BOOK II.,"arrangement, Brandimart was separated one night from his"
4884,BOOK II.,"companions, while Orlando and the two damsels were advancing on"
4885,BOOK II.,their way.
4886,BOOK II.,
4887,BOOK II.,"As these last, sorely tormented by hunger, were entering a valley"
4888,BOOK II.,"at sunset, they saw, at the other extremity, a party of"
4889,BOOK II.,"Lestrigonians, seated at their supper, and immediately galloped"
4890,BOOK II.,"towards them; Orlando first, but followed by the damsels. Arriving"
4891,BOOK II.,"amongst these cannibals, he prayed them, either for courtesy or"
4892,BOOK II.,"hire, to give them food; and, being received with a feigned"
4893,BOOK II.,"hospitality, had already dismounted from his horse, in order to"
4894,BOOK II.,"take some refreshment, when the leader of the party, coming behind"
4895,BOOK II.,"him, dealt a blow with his club, that laid him senseless on the"
4896,BOOK II.,"ground. The damsels, who had just come up, terrified at this"
4897,BOOK II.,"catastrophe, fled different ways, pursued by a party of the"
4898,BOOK II.,Lestrigonians.
4899,BOOK II.,
4900,BOOK II.,"During this time, the others had stript Orlando of his arms; and"
4901,BOOK II.,"were handling him, to see if he was fat, when he was awakened by"
4902,BOOK II.,"the operation. Possessing himself of Durindana, he soon cleared"
4903,BOOK II.,"the field of the cannibals, and was seeking an outlet from the"
4904,BOOK II.,"valley, when he recognized Angelica, hunted by those who had"
4905,BOOK II.,"pursued her and Flordelis. To save her, and avenge her of the"
4906,BOOK II.,"miscreants, was the work of a moment."
4907,BOOK II.,
4908,BOOK II.,It was said that the two damsels separated in their flight; in
4909,BOOK II.,"directing which, chance conducted each towards her natural"
4910,BOOK II.,"protector; for Flordelis, flying east, whilst Angelica fled west,"
4911,BOOK II.,"galloped towards a wood, where Brandimart was sleeping, after"
4912,BOOK II.,having long sought his companions in vain. Brandimart was as
4913,BOOK II.,"prompt in rescuing her, as Orlando was in saving Angelica. It is"
4914,BOOK II.,"needless to describe his transports on this occasion: these were,"
4915,BOOK II.,"however, of short duration; and he heard, with the bitterest"
4916,BOOK II.,"regret, the narrative of Flordelis, who, relating what she"
4917,BOOK II.,"believed she had witnessed, informed him she had left Orlando dead"
4918,BOOK II.,upon the field.
4919,BOOK II.,
4920,BOOK II.,Returning with Brandimart towards the spot where she had left the
4921,BOOK II.,"count, a strange adventure for a long time delayed their search;"
4922,BOOK II.,"for they had not ridden far, before they fell in with a cavalier"
4923,BOOK II.,"on foot, unarmed, except as to his sword, who defied Brandimart to"
4924,BOOK II.,"battle; and while he, in a spirit of generosity, refused the"
4925,BOOK II.,"challenge, snatched Flordelis from her palfrey, and running up a"
4926,BOOK II.,"steep rock with his burden, threatened to throw her down a"
4927,BOOK II.,"precipice, unless Brandimart ransomed her with his armour and his"
4928,BOOK II.,steed.
4929,BOOK II.,
4930,BOOK II.,"As Brandimart's armour rendered it impossible for him to pursue,"
4931,BOOK II.,he consented to the sacrifice; and the stranger appropriated the
4932,BOOK II.,"spoils. This was Marphisa, who had thrown-by her arms, in order to"
4933,BOOK II.,"pursue Brunello, and who, finding the chace hopeless, took this"
4934,BOOK II.,method to equip herself anew.
4935,BOOK II.,
4936,BOOK II.,"Brandimart, now reduced to his tunick, and deprived of his"
4937,BOOK II.,"courser, mounted the damsel's palfrey, seated her on the croup,"
4938,BOOK II.,and proceeded on his way.
4939,BOOK II.,
4940,BOOK II.,They were doomed to experience new dangers and interruptions. For
4941,BOOK II.,"journeying thus, they fell in with a band of robbers, from whom"
4942,BOOK II.,"Brandimart fled, in the hope of finding some means of defence. His"
4943,BOOK II.,"hope was realized; for, penetrating a wood, he arrived at a"
4944,BOOK II.,"fountain, near which a king lay dead, who was armed cap-a-pe."
4945,BOOK II.,"Providing himself with his sword, Brandimart turned to bay, and"
4946,BOOK II.,soon made his pursuers repent of their temerity. These slain or
4947,BOOK II.,"put to flight, he clothed himself reluctantly in the other arms of"
4948,BOOK II.,"the monarch, leaving him his crown and regal ornaments. This king"
4949,BOOK II.,"was no other than Agrican, so preserved by a visible miracle."
4950,BOOK II.,
4951,BOOK II.,An after-combat with the captain of these corsairs put the knight
4952,BOOK II.,"in possession of a steed, and thus re-equipt, he accompanied"
4953,BOOK II.,Flordelis in search of Orlando.
4954,BOOK II.,
4955,BOOK II.,"This paladin, having recovered Angelica (as has been related) had"
4956,BOOK II.,journeyed as far homeward as the sea-coast of Syria without
4957,BOOK II.,impediment. Here he found a vessel ready to carry the king of
4958,BOOK II.,"Damascus, Norandino, to the island of Cyprus, where he was to make"
4959,BOOK II.,his first essay of arms.
4960,BOOK II.,
4961,BOOK II.,"This was to be made for love of a lady whose name was Lucina, and"
4962,BOOK II.,"whose father, Tibiano was king of Cyprus. This sovereign had"
4963,BOOK II.,"proclaimed a tournament, of which the princess was to be the"
4964,BOOK II.,"prize, and thither went Norandino, who invited Orlando to"
4965,BOOK II.,"accompany him. The count, disguising his name and country, and"
4966,BOOK II.,"feigning himself a Circassian, called Rotolante, accepted the"
4967,BOOK II.,"offer, and, together with Angelica, joined Norandino, who was"
4968,BOOK II.,accompanied by a brilliant train of adventurers. He was scarcely
4969,BOOK II.,"on ship-board before a breeze sprang up from the land, and the"
4970,BOOK II.,galley was under sail.
4971,BOOK II.,
4972,BOOK II.,"For the tournament which was preparing, many Greeks and many"
4973,BOOK II.,"Pagans had assembled, among whom were Basaldo and Morbeco, Turks,"
4974,BOOK II.,"and Gostanzo a Greek. This Gostanzo was the son of Vataron,"
4975,BOOK II.,"emperor of Constantinople, and had brought Gryphon and Aquilant in"
4976,BOOK II.,"his company, who, together with Origilla had sought the"
4977,BOOK II.,hospitality of the Grecian court.
4978,BOOK II.,
4979,BOOK II.,In the tourney the combatants are ranged under the banner of this
4980,BOOK II.,"Gostanzo on the one side, and that of Norandino on the other."
4981,BOOK II.,"Gryphon and Aquilant serve under the first, and Orlando under the"
4982,BOOK II.,"second. They are, however, disguised from each other by borrowed"
4983,BOOK II.,"devices, and Gryphon only suspects a knight who bore away the"
4984,BOOK II.,"honors of the first day, to be Orlando, from his superior prowess,"
4985,BOOK II.,"and from the presence of Angelica, whom he had observed seated"
4986,BOOK II.,amongst the ladies that honoured the spectacle with their
4987,BOOK II.,presence.
4988,BOOK II.,
4989,BOOK II.,Imparting his suspicions to Gostanzo after the trumpets had blown
4990,BOOK II.,"to lodging, the wily Greek determined to rid himself of so"
4991,BOOK II.,formidable an adversary. He accordingly introduced himself
4992,BOOK II.,"secretly to Orlando, and informed him of a treason which (as he"
4993,BOOK II.,"said) the king of Cyprus meditated against him, at the instigation"
4994,BOOK II.,"of Ganelon, offering him at the same time the means of escape."
4995,BOOK II.,"This was a pinnace moored in a creek, in which Orlando, breathing"
4996,BOOK II.,"vengeance against the Maganzese, embarked with Angelica, for"
4997,BOOK II.,France.
4998,BOOK II.,
4999,BOOK II.,"Disembarking in Provence, they pursued their way by land, and"
5000,BOOK II.,"arriving hot, and weary, in the forest of Arden, where Rinaldo had"
5001,BOOK II.,"lately drunk of the fountain of Love, chance directed Angelica to"
5002,BOOK II.,"the waters of Disdain, of which she drank."
5003,BOOK II.,
5004,BOOK II.,"Issuing thence, the count and damsel encountered a stranger"
5005,BOOK II.,"knight. This was no other than Rinaldo, who had missed Rodomont,"
5006,BOOK II.,"then engaged in combat with Ferrau; and who, on a nearer approach,"
5007,BOOK II.,"recognised Angelica with joy, though his new arms and ensigns"
5008,BOOK II.,"disguised Orlando, who accompanied her. The consequences of such a"
5009,BOOK II.,"meeting are easily foreseen. Angelica views Rinaldo with disgust,"
5010,BOOK II.,and a new cause of strife is kindled between the kinsmen.
5011,BOOK II.,
5012,BOOK II.,"Terrified at the combat which ensued, Angelica fled amain, through"
5013,BOOK II.,"the forest, and came out upon a plain, covered with tents. This"
5014,BOOK II.,"was the camp of Charlemagne, who led the army of reserve, destined"
5015,BOOK II.,to support the troops which had advanced to oppose the descent of
5016,BOOK II.,"Rodomont. Charles, having heard the damsel's tale, with difficulty"
5017,BOOK II.,"separates the two cousins, and then consigns Angelica, as the"
5018,BOOK II.,"cause of quarrel, to the care of Namus duke of Bavaria, promising"
5019,BOOK II.,"she shall be _his_ who best deserves her, in the first battle with"
5020,BOOK II.,the Saracens.
5021,BOOK II.,
5022,BOOK II.,"The author here returns to Agramant, who was left holding a"
5023,BOOK II.,tournament at the foot of Mount Carena in Africa. He having heard
5024,BOOK II.,"of the knight who was slain, and _that_, contrary to his orders,"
5025,BOOK II.,"(which were only to employ courteous weapons,) determined to take"
5026,BOOK II.,"vengeance upon his murderer, and supposing Brunello to be the"
5027,BOOK II.,"criminal, (since Rogero had appeared with his arms and steed,)"
5028,BOOK II.,ordered him to be hanged upon the spot.
5029,BOOK II.,
5030,BOOK II.,"The danger of him who was about to suffer for his sake, now again"
5031,BOOK II.,brought Rogero from his retreat. He routed the troops appointed to
5032,BOOK II.,"watch over the execution, rescued Brunello, and then, presenting"
5033,BOOK II.,"himself to Agramant, related every thing as it had passed."
5034,BOOK II.,
5035,BOOK II.,"Agramant, too happy to find the object of his search in the youth"
5036,BOOK II.,"who had performed such wonders, forgave the death of the"
5037,BOOK II.,"slaughtered cavalier, knighted Rogero, and carried him off to"
5038,BOOK II.,"Biserta, where his vassal kings and barons assembled for the"
5039,BOOK II.,invasion of Christendom.
5040,BOOK II.,
5041,BOOK II.,"While they are in the midst of their revelry, a messenger reports"
5042,BOOK II.,"the return of Rodomont's fleet, whose followers brought with them,"
5043,BOOK II.,"as a prisoner, Dudon the Dane; but could give no account of"
5044,BOOK II.,Rodomont their leader.
5045,BOOK II.,
5046,BOOK II.,"He was this while engaged in battle with Ferrau, with whom we left"
5047,BOOK II.,him quarrelling about Doralice; but their strife was soon
5048,BOOK II.,"interrupted by the arrival of a messenger, who brought news that"
5049,BOOK II.,"Marsilius was, at the instigation of Ganelon, besieging Mount"
5050,BOOK II.,"Albano. On hearing this, the duellists make peace, and ride"
5051,BOOK II.,together to join the besiegers.
5052,BOOK II.,
5053,BOOK II.,"On their way they fall in with Vivian and Malagigi, sons of duke"
5054,BOOK II.,"Aymon, of Mount Albano, who are proceeding towards Paris, to"
5055,BOOK II.,"demand succour of Charlemagne; and Malagigi, retiring with Vivian"
5056,BOOK II.,"into a wood, performs a magic rite, by which he ascertains the"
5057,BOOK II.,design of the approaching warriors Rodomont and Ferrau. To
5058,BOOK II.,"frustrate this, he conjures up a bevy of fiends, armed and mounted"
5059,BOOK II.,"as knights, divides them into two squadrons, takes the command of"
5060,BOOK II.,"one himself, and gives that of the other to Vivian. Thus"
5061,BOOK II.,"accompanied, the Christian knights charge their adversaries. But"
5062,BOOK II.,"the Pagans are too strong for them, take Malagigi and Vivian"
5063,BOOK II.,"prisoners, and send their demons howling back to hell."
5064,BOOK II.,
5065,BOOK II.,"Here the author exclaims,"
5066,BOOK II.,
5067,BOOK II.,"But that I would not seem with folly tainted,"
5068,BOOK II.,I own I would have fain beheld the attack;
5069,BOOK II.,So great is my desire to be acquainted
5070,BOOK II.,With those the wizard brought his cause to back:
5071,BOOK II.,"And prove with my own eyes, if truly painted,"
5072,BOOK II.,The devil be so very foul and black;
5073,BOOK II.,"More; that his pictures differ as to nail,"
5074,BOOK II.,"And horn, and hoof, and length and breadth of tail."
5075,BOOK II.,
5076,BOOK II.,"To return to the story, Rodomont and Ferrau arrive in the Spanish"
5077,BOOK II.,"camp before Mount Albano, which is shortly afterwards attacked by"
5078,BOOK II.,the army of Charlemagne. Divers feats of prowess are achieved on
5079,BOOK II.,both sides; but the most interesting circumstance is a single
5080,BOOK II.,combat between Rodomont and Bradamant; which the author breaks off
5081,BOOK II.,in order to resume the story of Brandimart.
5082,BOOK II.,
5083,BOOK II.,"This knight, having obtained a steed and armour, as has been"
5084,BOOK II.,"before related, proceeds with Flordelis towards Europe."
5085,BOOK II.,
5086,BOOK II.,"Thus journeying, the pair arrived in front of a magnificent"
5087,BOOK II.,"palace. Here a damsel, standing in a balcony, motioned to them to"
5088,BOOK II.,"take another way; but in vain; for Brandimart, feigning not to"
5089,BOOK II.,"understand the purport of her signs, rode boldly up to the gate."
5090,BOOK II.,"He is now opposed by a giant, armed with a serpent, which he uses"
5091,BOOK II.,"as a sword. Him the knight vanquishes after a long battle, in"
5092,BOOK II.,which he is opposed by a variety of enchantments; the giant and
5093,BOOK II.,"serpent exchanging forms, as one or the other is slain He next"
5094,BOOK II.,"kills a knight who kept a sepulchre in the inner court, and"
5095,BOOK II.,opposed his further progress.
5096,BOOK II.,
5097,BOOK II.,"He and Flordelis, who had followed her lover, now seek the gate by"
5098,BOOK II.,"which they had entered, but all appearance of it was lost."
5099,BOOK II.,
5100,BOOK II.,"While they are vainly seeking the means of escape, they are"
5101,BOOK II.,addressed by the damsel who had at first waved them from the
5102,BOOK II.,"palace; and who informed Brandimart, he must open the sepulchre,"
5103,BOOK II.,"and kiss whatever issued from it, if he expected deliverance from"
5104,BOOK II.,"his prison. Brandimart, little terrified by the injunction,"
5105,BOOK II.,"promised compliance; but started back, and put his hand to his"
5106,BOOK II.,"sword, on the appearance of a dragon. Reproached by the damsel of"
5107,BOOK II.,"the castle for his breach of promise, he manned his spirits for"
5108,BOOK II.,"the encounter, and kissed the monster in the mouth. A sudden cold"
5109,BOOK II.,ran through his bones at coming in contact with her: but what was
5110,BOOK II.,"his surprise, on seeing the dragon transformed into a beautiful"
5111,BOOK II.,damsel!
5112,BOOK II.,
5113,BOOK II.,"This was a fay so transmuted, who, grateful for her deliverance,"
5114,BOOK II.,"offered to enchant the horse and arms of Brandimart, at the same"
5115,BOOK II.,"time entreating him to conduct the lady of the castle, who was"
5116,BOOK II.,"named Doristella, into Syria."
5117,BOOK II.,
5118,BOOK II.,"This promised, the gate re-appeared, the fay enchanted the steed"
5119,BOOK II.,"and arms of Brandimart, and he, accompanied by the two ladies,"
5120,BOOK II.,departed upon the quest enjoined.
5121,BOOK II.,
5122,BOOK II.,"They had ridden some time in silence, when Doristella, rallying"
5123,BOOK II.,"the knight for his taciturnity, proposed to beguile the way with"
5124,BOOK II.,"the relation of her adventures. The offer was gratefully received,"
5125,BOOK II.,and the damsel began her story as follows:—
5126,BOOK II.,
5127,BOOK II.,"""My father, king Doliston,"" said she, ""had two daughters, the"
5128,BOOK II.,"eldest of whom, while yet a child, was carried off by a thief from"
5129,BOOK II.,"the shore of Lissa. Of this daughter, who was the promised spouse"
5130,BOOK II.,"of Theodore the son of a neighbouring king, nothing was ever"
5131,BOOK II.,"afterwards heard."""
5132,BOOK II.,
5133,BOOK II.,"""And what was the name of the mother?"" exclaimed Flordelis; but"
5134,BOOK II.,"Brandimart having checked her for her interruption, Doristella"
5135,BOOK II.,"continued her narrative in her own way. ""My intended brother-in-law,"""
5136,BOOK II.,"said the damsel, ""still kept up his connection with my"
5137,BOOK II.,"family, and he and I soon became mutually enamoured of one"
5138,BOOK II.,"another. The young man at length unbosomed himself to my father,"
5139,BOOK II.,"and demanded me in marriage; but my father, to his mortification,"
5140,BOOK II.,"told him, that he had that very day promised me to the wretch,"
5141,BOOK II.,whom you slew in the palace.
5142,BOOK II.,
5143,BOOK II.,"""To this wretch, named Usbeck of Bursa, a Turcoman by nation, was"
5144,BOOK II.,"I wedded; a man valiant in the field, but, as to the rest, little"
5145,BOOK II.,"capable of winning a lady's love. This man, who was jealous in"
5146,BOOK II.,"proportion to the grounds he gave me for disgust, was compelled to"
5147,BOOK II.,join an expedition against Vatarone the emperor of Greece.
5148,BOOK II.,"Departing, he left me in care of a slave called Gambone, a monster"
5149,BOOK II.,"of deformity, whom he commanded never to stir from my side. He had"
5150,BOOK II.,"not been long absent, when Theodore arrived at Bursa, and having"
5151,BOOK II.,"corrupted Gambone, obtained access to my bed."
5152,BOOK II.,
5153,BOOK II.,"""Our intercourse was long continued, to our mutual satisfaction,"
5154,BOOK II.,"when Usbeck arrived suddenly one night at Bursa, and demanded"
5155,BOOK II.,instant entrance into his house. Our courage did not desert us
5156,BOOK II.,"under these circumstances, and Theodore, slipping down stairs in"
5157,BOOK II.,"the dark, escaped at the same time that Usbeck was admitted. Our"
5158,BOOK II.,"danger, however, did not end here; for my husband's suspicions had"
5159,BOOK II.,"been awakened by his detention at the door, and searching every"
5160,BOOK II.,"part of my chamber, he found a mantle which my lover had left"
5161,BOOK II.,behind him in his retreat.
5162,BOOK II.,
5163,BOOK II.,"""His suspicions being now confirmed, he burst into a transport of"
5164,BOOK II.,"jealous fury, and ordered the slave Gambone for instant execution."
5165,BOOK II.,"According to the custom of the country, his other slaves were"
5166,BOOK II.,"conducting him for that purpose, through the city with a horn"
5167,BOOK II.,"sounding before him, when Theodore met the procession, and falling"
5168,BOOK II.,"upon the criminal, reproached him, amid a shower of blows, with"
5169,BOOK II.,"having robbed him of his mantle. This trick of Theodore's, who was"
5170,BOOK II.,"unknown to Usbeck, saved the slave, and effaced the suspicions"
5171,BOOK II.,"which he entertained of my fidelity. New offences, however, on my"
5172,BOOK II.,"part, for I still continued my intercourse with Theodore, renewed"
5173,BOOK II.,"his jealousy, and he at last shut me up in the enchanted palace"
5174,BOOK II.,whence you delivered me; though it was not then kept by the giant
5175,BOOK II.,"and serpent, which were the afterwork of a necromancer who wrought"
5176,BOOK II.,"for him."""
5177,BOOK II.,
5178,BOOK II.,"The damsel was here interrupted by an outcry, and the party was"
5179,BOOK II.,"instantly set upon by thieves. These were, however, beaten off,"
5180,BOOK II.,"and their leader taken prisoner by Brandimart. He, throwing"
5181,BOOK II.,"himself at the feet of the cavalier, entreated him not to carry"
5182,BOOK II.,"him to Lissa, as he dreaded the vengeance of Doliston, the prince"
5183,BOOK II.,"of that country, for having formerly carried off his eldest"
5184,BOOK II.,"daughter, whom he had sold to the lord of the Sylvan Tower."
5185,BOOK II.,
5186,BOOK II.,"Brandimart, however, who has secret reasons (as will be shortly"
5187,BOOK II.,"seen) for being pleased at this account, insists upon carrying him"
5188,BOOK II.,"to Lissa; and arriving before Doliston's capital, finds it"
5189,BOOK II.,"besieged by Theodore, in revenge for the monarch's having refused"
5190,BOOK II.,him Doristella. All now is cleared up. Flordelis turns out to be
5191,BOOK II.,"the missing daughter of Doliston, who had been wooed by Brandimart"
5192,BOOK II.,in the Sylvan Tower; and no further obstacle existing to the union
5193,BOOK II.,"of Theodore and Doristella, these two, as well as Brandimart and"
5194,BOOK II.,"Flordelis, are united in marriage; Doliston and Theodora having"
5195,BOOK II.,previously made peace.
5196,BOOK II.,
5197,BOOK II.,"After long festivities in honour of these double espousals,"
5198,BOOK II.,"Brandimart and Flordelis, still anxious to pursue Orlando, embark"
5199,BOOK II.,"for France with a prosperous wind. This, however, changes;"
5200,BOOK II.,increases to a tempest; and finally drives them on the shores of
5201,BOOK II.,"Carthage. Here Brandimart, less anxious for his own safety than"
5202,BOOK II.,"for that of Flordelis and his companions, conceals his being a"
5203,BOOK II.,"Christian, and announcing himself only as son of Monodontes, king"
5204,BOOK II.,"of the Distant Isles, declares that it was his purpose to visit"
5205,BOOK II.,Agramant in Biserta.
5206,BOOK II.,
5207,BOOK II.,"He accordingly sets off, always attended by Flordelis, for that"
5208,BOOK II.,"capital; where he is magnificently received, and is afterwards"
5209,BOOK II.,"carried off by Agramant, together with Rogero, on his expedition"
5210,BOOK II.,against France.
5211,BOOK II.,
5212,BOOK II.,"Agramant, leaving Dudon a prisoner at large in Biserta, which was"
5213,BOOK II.,"to be governed in his absence by a vice-roy, embarks upon his long"
5214,BOOK II.,"meditated enterprise, disembarks in Spain, and arrives, by forced"
5215,BOOK II.,"marches, near Mount Albano, in the neighbourhood of which the"
5216,BOOK II.,armies of Charlemagne and Marsilius were left engaged.
5217,BOOK II.,
5218,BOOK II.,The strife was still continued with unabated fury; and in this
5219,BOOK II.,"Rinaldo was matched with Ferrau, king Grandonio with the marquis"
5220,BOOK II.,"Oliviero, Serpentine with Ogier the Dane, and Marsilius himself"
5221,BOOK II.,against Charlemagne.
5222,BOOK II.,
5223,BOOK II.,"These duels were, however, of little account, compared with that"
5224,BOOK II.,which raged between Rodomont and Bradamant. Of this desperate
5225,BOOK II.,contest Orlando was a witness; who would not turn his arms against
5226,BOOK II.,Rodomont while he was engaged with so formidable an adversary.
5227,BOOK II.,
5228,BOOK II.,"While Orlando thus played the part of a looker-on, he was"
5229,BOOK II.,"surprised by the sound of an approaching enemy, and casting his"
5230,BOOK II.,"eyes in that direction, saw a plump of spears, with banners and"
5231,BOOK II.,"pennons, descending the sides of a mountain. He immediately"
5232,BOOK II.,stooped from his saddle to pick up a weighty lance which was lying
5233,BOOK II.,"on the ground, and thus prepared himself for the encounter of what"
5234,BOOK II.,proved to be the army of Agramant.
5235,BOOK II.,
5236,BOOK II.,This sovereign had in the meantime dispatched one of his vassal
5237,BOOK II.,"kings, named Pinadoro, towards the field of battle, with orders to"
5238,BOOK II.,"bring him one or more prisoners, who might inform him of the state"
5239,BOOK II.,of the Christian army. Pinadoro and Orlando meet and tilt
5240,BOOK II.,"together; but the feudatory king, instead of accomplishing the"
5241,BOOK II.,"orders of his sovereign, remains the prisoner of the count. He is,"
5242,BOOK II.,"however, no sooner taken than liberated by his conqueror, who bids"
5243,BOOK II.,him return to his army in peace. The report of his ill success
5244,BOOK II.,does not frighten Agramant from his purpose; and the Moorish army
5245,BOOK II.,descends like a torrent into the plain.
5246,BOOK II.,
5247,BOOK II.,"At the sight of these new enemies, Charles left Marsilius, who was"
5248,BOOK II.,"closely pressed by him, and ordered Rinaldo also to give a respite"
5249,BOOK II.,"to Ferrau, and lead a squadron against the approaching troops,"
5250,BOOK II.,whom he divined to be what they really were. Other divisions of
5251,BOOK II.,"the army followed in support of one another, and a bloody battle"
5252,BOOK II.,"ensued, with various and very doubtful success."
5253,BOOK II.,
5254,BOOK II.,"Meantime Orlando, who wished such measure of misfortune to"
5255,BOOK II.,"Charlemagne as should make his assistance necessary, and ensure"
5256,BOOK II.,"him the possession of Angelica as his reward, had retired from the"
5257,BOOK II.,"medley into a neighbouring wood, and was praying devoutly for the"
5258,BOOK II.,"discomfiture of the Christians. By accident, Ferrau, fatigued by"
5259,BOOK II.,"his long contest with Rinaldo, and lately as hard pressed by him"
5260,BOOK II.,"as Marsilius was by Charlemagne, had sought shelter in the same"
5261,BOOK II.,"retreat. Here, stooping to drink from the banks of a river, he"
5262,BOOK II.,"dropt his helmet in the water, and was engaged in a vain attempt"
5263,BOOK II.,"to recover it, when he was discovered by Orlando. The count,"
5264,BOOK II.,"however, was too generous to attack an enemy under such"
5265,BOOK II.,"disadvantages, and weakened as Ferrau evidently was by the combat"
5266,BOOK II.,"he had previously waged against Rinaldo. He accordingly, after a"
5267,BOOK II.,"short conference with him, in which he learned the state of"
5268,BOOK II.,"things, spurred his courser, in order to join the army of"
5269,BOOK II.,Charlemagne.
5270,BOOK II.,
5271,BOOK II.,"Here he performs high feats of valour, and, after the slaughter of"
5272,BOOK II.,"many adversaries, is advancing against Rogero, when Atlantes, who"
5273,BOOK II.,"had accompanied the youth, (since he could not restrain him from"
5274,BOOK II.,"following his destiny,) diverts Orlando from his object by the"
5275,BOOK II.,"vision of a triumphant Pagan squadron, and of the personal danger"
5276,BOOK II.,"of Charlemagne. Fascinated by this illusion, he follows the"
5277,BOOK II.,supposed Saracens into the forest of Arden. Here the vision
5278,BOOK II.,"disappears; and the count, wearied with the fruitless chace,"
5279,BOOK II.,"lights from Brigliadoro near a fountain. Stooping to drink, he"
5280,BOOK II.,"sees a crystal palace at the bottom, through the walls of which he"
5281,BOOK II.,"beholds a dance of ladies, and, unable to resist the temptation of"
5282,BOOK II.,"an adventure, plunges, armed as he is, into the fountain."

5301,BOOK III.,"the north. Here a mighty storm was gathering; and France, already"
5302,BOOK III.,"sore-bested, was suddenly threatened by a new storm from the"
5303,BOOK III.,remote quarter of Tartary.
5304,BOOK III.,
5305,BOOK III.,"The emperor of this region, named Mandricardo, having wasted it by"
5306,BOOK III.,"his violences, was proceeding in a course of imperious tyranny,"
5307,BOOK III.,"when an old man threw himself in his way, and, reproaching him"
5308,BOOK III.,"with his outrages, bade him desist from warring upon the innocent"
5309,BOOK III.,"and defenceless, and seek to revenge the death of his father upon"
5310,BOOK III.,"one who was worthy of his wrath; to wit, upon Orlando, the"
5311,BOOK III.,murderer of king Agrican.
5312,BOOK III.,
5313,BOOK III.,"Stung to the heart by the old man's reproaches, Mandricardo,"
5314,BOOK III.,determining to owe his success in the enterprise on which he
5315,BOOK III.,"resolved to his own individual valour, leaves his kingdom"
5316,BOOK III.,"incognito, and departs, without horse or arms, towards the west."
5317,BOOK III.,"Travelling thus alone and a-foot, he had passed the confines of"
5318,BOOK III.,"Armenia, when he spied upon a day a pavilion, pitched near a"
5319,BOOK III.,fountain; and imagining that he might there find what he was
5320,BOOK III.,"determined to win by force, entered it, with the view of searching"
5321,BOOK III.,for the horse and arms of which he stood in need. There was none
5322,BOOK III.,"to defend the entrance, and he was already within the pavilion,"
5323,BOOK III.,"when a voice was heard to murmur from the waters, that he was a"
5324,BOOK III.,"prisoner to the power, whose possession he had violated."
5325,BOOK III.,
5326,BOOK III.,"Mandricardo, however, heard not, or else disregarded the voice;"
5327,BOOK III.,"and pursuing his search, found a suit of armour, disposed upon a"
5328,BOOK III.,"carpet, and a courser fastened to a neighbouring pine."
5329,BOOK III.,
5330,BOOK III.,"He immediately clothed himself in the arms, and seized upon the"
5331,BOOK III.,"steed, with which he was departing, when a fire suddenly sprang up"
5332,BOOK III.,"before him, that, spreading itself, destroyed the pine, and left"
5333,BOOK III.,the fountain and pavilion alone untouched. Mandricardo is himself
5334,BOOK III.,"embraced by the flames, which destroy his armour and clothing even"
5335,BOOK III.,"to his shirt. To escape the torture, he leaps from his horse,"
5336,BOOK III.,"every thing which he had on him being consumed, and casts himself"
5337,BOOK III.,"into the water. Here, he is received into the arms of a naked"
5338,BOOK III.,"damsel of incomparable beauty, who kisses him, and bids him be of"
5339,BOOK III.,"good cheer, informing him that he is taken in the snare of a"
5340,BOOK III.,"fairy, but that if he has heart and discretion, he may rescue not"
5341,BOOK III.,"only himself, but so many damsels and cavaliers, that he shall"
5342,BOOK III.,reap immortal glory from the achievement.
5343,BOOK III.,
5344,BOOK III.,"She pursued her story, informing him, that the fountain was the"
5345,BOOK III.,"work of a fairy, who had imprisoned there king Gradasso of"
5346,BOOK III.,"Sericane, Gryphon and Aquilant, and many other knights and ladies."
5347,BOOK III.,"""Beyond the hill,"" said she, ""which you see before you, is"
5348,BOOK III.,"situated a castle, where this fairy has laid up the arms of"
5349,BOOK III.,"Hector, with the exception of his sword. On his being slain"
5350,BOOK III.,"treacherously by Achilles, a queen, named Penthesilea, possessed"
5351,BOOK III.,"herself of this. At her death it passed to Almontes, and from him"
5352,BOOK III.,was taken by Orlando. This weapon was called Durindana. The
5353,BOOK III.,"remainder of his arms was saved and carried off by Æneas, from"
5354,BOOK III.,"whom they were received by her, in recompence of a marvellous"
5355,BOOK III.,service which she had bestowed upon him. If you have the courage
5356,BOOK III.,"to attempt the acquisition of these arms, secured in yonder castle"
5357,BOOK III.,"by enchantment, I will be your guide."""
5358,BOOK III.,
5359,BOOK III.,"Mandricardo was enraptured at the proposal, and only hesitated at"
5360,BOOK III.,"the idea of exposing himself naked. This difficulty was, however,"
5361,BOOK III.,"got over by the lady, who, letting down her hair, which was bound"
5362,BOOK III.,"about her head in braids, furnished a complete covering for"
5363,BOOK III.,"herself and the cavalier. Being sheltered from sight by this, they"
5364,BOOK III.,"issued, linked arm in arm, from the water, and took their way"
5365,BOOK III.,together to the pavilion.
5366,BOOK III.,
5367,BOOK III.,"Entering this, which, as was said, remained untouched by the fire,"
5368,BOOK III.,they reposed for some time upon flowers. At length the damsel gave
5369,BOOK III.,"the signal for departure, and having clothed Mandricardo in"
5370,BOOK III.,"armour, conducted him where a courser was in waiting. Upon this he"
5371,BOOK III.,"leapt, all armed as he was; and the lady having mounted on a"
5372,BOOK III.,"palfrey, both set forward on their enterprise."
5373,BOOK III.,
5374,BOOK III.,"They had ridden about a mile, when the damsel, explaining the"
5375,BOOK III.,"dangers of the quest, informed Mandricardo that he would have to"
5376,BOOK III.,"combat with Gradasso, the conqueror of Gryphon, who had at first"
5377,BOOK III.,maintained the field against all comers.
5378,BOOK III.,
5379,BOOK III.,"Thus speaking, they arrived at the castle, which was of alabaster,"
5380,BOOK III.,"overlaid with gold. Before this, on a lawn, enclosed with a"
5381,BOOK III.,"barrier of live myrtles, sat an armed knight on horseback, and who"
5382,BOOK III.,"was no other than Gradasso. Mandricardo, upon seeing him, dropt"
5383,BOOK III.,"his vizor, and laid his lance in the rest. The champion of the"
5384,BOOK III.,"castle was as ready, and each spurred towards his opponent. They"
5385,BOOK III.,"splintered their spears with equal force, and again returning to"
5386,BOOK III.,"the charge, encountered with their swords. This contest was long"
5387,BOOK III.,"and doubtful, when Mandricardo, determining to bring it to an"
5388,BOOK III.,"issue, threw his arms about Gradasso, and the two horsemen,"
5389,BOOK III.,"grappling together, tumbled to the ground. In the struggle,"
5390,BOOK III.,"however, Mandricardo fell uppermost, and preserving his advantage,"
5391,BOOK III.,"made Gradasso prisoner. The damsel now interfered, proclaiming the"
5392,BOOK III.,"victory of the new comer, and consoling the vanquished as she"
5393,BOOK III.,"could, for his discomfiture."
5394,BOOK III.,
5395,BOOK III.,"In the meantime, the sun had set upon the strife, and it was too"
5396,BOOK III.,"late for Mandricardo to enter the enchanted castle, which the"
5397,BOOK III.,damsel informed him would be only accessible after sunrise. She
5398,BOOK III.,"invites him, therefore, to lie down amongst the flowers with which"
5399,BOOK III.,"the meadow is enamelled, proffering to be his guard; but informs"
5400,BOOK III.,"him, that there is harbourage to be obtained at a neighbouring"
5401,BOOK III.,"castle, though it can only be purchased by exposure to notable"
5402,BOOK III.,"peril. This, she says, is kept by a kind and courteous lady, who"
5403,BOOK III.,"is often disturbed, in the exercise of her hospitality, by a giant"
5404,BOOK III.,"named Malapresa, whom he would do well to avoid, as he has already"
5405,BOOK III.,sufficient toil and danger on his hands.
5406,BOOK III.,
5407,BOOK III.,"Mandricardo rejects this kind intimation, and insists upon being"
5408,BOOK III.,guided to the lady's lodging.
5409,BOOK III.,
5410,BOOK III.,"He and the damsel accordingly set off in that direction, and soon"
5411,BOOK III.,"arrive at the palace, which is illuminated with a thousand lights."
5412,BOOK III.,It appeared as if a watch was kept for friends or foes; and a
5413,BOOK III.,"dwarf was posted in a gallery over the entrance, whose duty it was"
5414,BOOK III.,"to give notice of all comers. On the winding of his horn, if there"
5415,BOOK III.,"were cause for suspicion, the household, armed with missile"
5416,BOOK III.,"weapons, assembled in the balconies: but if it were an errant"
5417,BOOK III.,"knight, in search of hospitality, damsels came forth to salute"
5418,BOOK III.,"him, and conduct him into the castle."
5419,BOOK III.,
5420,BOOK III.,"In this manner was Mandricardo received, who was afterwards"
5421,BOOK III.,magnificently entertained by the lady of the mansion. Their
5422,BOOK III.,"festivity is, however, interrupted by the dwarf's horn, which"
5423,BOOK III.,"sounds an alarum. The signal is hardly given, before Malapresa has"
5424,BOOK III.,"forced the gate, and appears in the middle of the guests, armed"
5425,BOOK III.,with an enormous mace. A furious combat now ensues between him and
5426,BOOK III.,"the Tartar king, in which the giant is slain, and cast into the"
5427,BOOK III.,castle ditch. This event occasions only a short interruption of
5428,BOOK III.,"the festivity, which is prolonged late into the night. The"
5429,BOOK III.,"revellers at length retire; and Mandricardo amongst the rest, who"
5430,BOOK III.,"is as magnificently lodged, as he had been feasted, by the lady of"
5431,BOOK III.,the castle.
5432,BOOK III.,
5433,BOOK III.,"At sun-rise he starts from his couch, descends into the castle-garden,"
5434,BOOK III.,"washes himself at a fountain; then puts on his armour,"
5435,BOOK III.,"and, guided by his former conductress, proceeds upon his"
5436,BOOK III.,enterprise.
5437,BOOK III.,
5438,BOOK III.,On arriving at the eastern entrance of the outer wall of the
5439,BOOK III.,"enchanted castle, which was not more magnificent than extensive,"
5440,BOOK III.,"and which entrance Mandricardo found undefended, he was informed,"
5441,BOOK III.,"that he must plight an oath upon the threshold, to touch a shield"
5442,BOOK III.,which was suspended there from a pilaster of gold. The bearing of
5443,BOOK III.,"this was a white eagle on an azure field, in memory of the bird of"
5444,BOOK III.,"Jove, who bore away Ganymede, the flower of the Phrygian race."
5445,BOOK III.,Beneath was engraved the following legend:
5446,BOOK III.,
5447,BOOK III.,"Let none, with hand profane, my buckler wrong,"
5448,BOOK III.,Unless he be himself as Hector strong.
5449,BOOK III.,
5450,BOOK III.,"The damsel immediately, alighting from her palfrey, inclined"
5451,BOOK III.,herself to the ground; the Tartar king bent himself with equal
5452,BOOK III.,"reverence, and afterwards passed the threshold without an"
5453,BOOK III.,obstacle.
5454,BOOK III.,
5455,BOOK III.,Advancing through the eastern entrance of the enclosure towards
5456,BOOK III.,"the shield, Mandricardo touched it with his sword. An earthquake"
5457,BOOK III.,"immediately shook the place, and the way by which he had entered"
5458,BOOK III.,"closed. Another, and an opposite gate, however, opened, and"
5459,BOOK III.,"displayed a field, bristling with stalks and grain of gold. The"
5460,BOOK III.,"damsel upon this told him, that he who had entered had no means of"
5461,BOOK III.,"departure but by cutting down the harvest which was before him,"
5462,BOOK III.,and in uprooting a tree which grew in the middle of the field. The
5463,BOOK III.,"champion, without answering, prepared himself for his work, and"
5464,BOOK III.,immediately began to mow the harvest with his sword. A strange
5465,BOOK III.,effect followed; and every grain was instantly transformed into
5466,BOOK III.,"some ravenous animal,—lion, panther, or unicorn, who all flew in"
5467,BOOK III.,fury at the reaper.
5468,BOOK III.,
5469,BOOK III.,"Mandricardo, thus assailed, snatched up a stone, without knowing"
5470,BOOK III.,"what virtue resided in it, and cast it amongst the herd. This"
5471,BOOK III.,"stone was party-coloured, green, vermilion, white, azure and gold."
5472,BOOK III.,A strange wonder followed: for it no sooner lighted amongst the
5473,BOOK III.,"beasts, than they turned their rage one against the other, and"
5474,BOOK III.,perished by mutual wounds. Mandricardo did not stop to marvel at
5475,BOOK III.,"the miracle, but proceeded to fulfil his task, and uproot the"
5476,BOOK III.,"tree. This, which was lofty and full of leaves, he embraced by the"
5477,BOOK III.,"trunk, making vigorous efforts to tear it up by the roots. At each"
5478,BOOK III.,"of these fell a shower of leaves, which were instantly changed"
5479,BOOK III.,"into birds of prey, who attacked the knight, as the beasts had"
5480,BOOK III.,"done before. Undismayed, however, by this new annoyance, he"
5481,BOOK III.,continued to tug at the trunk till it yielded to his efforts. A
5482,BOOK III.,"burst of wind and thunder followed, and the hawks and vultures"
5483,BOOK III.,were dispersed.
5484,BOOK III.,
5485,BOOK III.,"These, however, only gave place to a new foe; for from the hole"
5486,BOOK III.,"made by tearing up the tree, issued a furious serpent with many"
5487,BOOK III.,"tails, who darted at Mandricardo, wound herself about his limbs,"
5488,BOOK III.,"and was about to devour him. Fortune, however, again stood his"
5489,BOOK III.,"friend; for, writhing under the folds of the monster, and"
5490,BOOK III.,"struggling to free himself, he fell backwards into the hole, and"
5491,BOOK III.,his enemy was crushed beneath his weight.
5492,BOOK III.,
5493,BOOK III.,"Mandricardo, when he had somewhat recovered from the shock, and"
5494,BOOK III.,"assured himself of the destruction of the dragon, began to"
5495,BOOK III.,"contemplate the place into which he had fallen, and saw that he"
5496,BOOK III.,"was in a vault, encrusted with costly metals, and illuminated by a"
5497,BOOK III.,"live coal. In the middle was a sort of ivory bier, and upon this"
5498,BOOK III.,"was extended, what appeared to be a knight in armour, but what was"
5499,BOOK III.,"in truth, an empty trophy, composed of the rich and precious arms,"
5500,BOOK III.,"once Hector's, and to which nothing was wanting but the sword."
5501,BOOK III.,"While Mandricardo stood contemplating the prize, a door opened"
5502,BOOK III.,"behind him, and a bevy of fair damsels entered dancing, who bore"
5503,BOOK III.,"him away to the place where the shield was suspended, and where he"
5504,BOOK III.,found the fairy of the castle seated in state. By her he was
5505,BOOK III.,"invested with the arms which he had won, he first swearing, at her"
5506,BOOK III.,"injunction, to wear no other blade but the sword Durindana, which"
5507,BOOK III.,"he was to ravish from Orlando, and thus complete the conquest of"
5508,BOOK III.,Hector's arms.
5509,BOOK III.,
5510,BOOK III.,"The adventure was now accomplished, and the champion departed in"
5511,BOOK III.,"order to achieve the great purpose, for which he left his realm of"
5512,BOOK III.,Tartary. Many illustrious knights issued at the same time from the
5513,BOOK III.,"dungeons of the fairy, who had remained prisoners on a failure of"
5514,BOOK III.,"their enterprise, and who had been now liberated by his success."
5515,BOOK III.,"Amongst these were Gradasso, Isolier, Sacripant, Gryphon, and"
5516,BOOK III.,"Aquilant, with many others."
5517,BOOK III.,
5518,BOOK III.,"Mandricardo himself pursued his journey, in company with Gradasso."
5519,BOOK III.,"Of the others, Gryphon and Aquilant, who knew the language of the"
5520,BOOK III.,"Saracens, travelled through strange countries; and thus journeying"
5521,BOOK III.,"along the sea-shore, fell in with two damsels, the one clothed in"
5522,BOOK III.,"white, and the other in black, and attended by two dwarfs. As the"
5523,BOOK III.,"colour of their respective ladies, such was that of their dwarfs,"
5524,BOOK III.,"and of the palfreys which they rode: saving in this, they were so"
5525,BOOK III.,"alike, as to be undistinguishable one from the other; and were"
5526,BOOK III.,equals in beauty and grace.
5527,BOOK III.,
5528,BOOK III.,"""Sister,"" said one of these, addressing herself to her companion,"
5529,BOOK III.,"""there is no defence against destiny; yet wisdom may in some sort,"
5530,BOOK III.,"controul fortune: then let us detain these, at least awhile, from"
5531,BOOK III.,"the fate which is reserved for them in France.""—Thus spoke the"
5532,BOOK III.,"sable to the white damsel, unheard of the two knights who were"
5533,BOOK III.,"approaching, and who saluted them with all the courtesy due to"
5534,BOOK III.,their bearing and appearance.
5535,BOOK III.,
5536,BOOK III.,One of the ladies demanded a boon of the two cavaliers; who both
5537,BOOK III.,as instantly vowed to perform whatever was enjoined them. This was
5538,BOOK III.,"to take the field against a miscreant, named Orrilo, engendered of"
5539,BOOK III.,"a goblin and fairy, who inhabited a tower upon the Nile, where he"
5540,BOOK III.,"kept (says the story) a kind of dragon, termed a crocodile, and"
5541,BOOK III.,"fed it with human flesh. The damsels go on to state, that hitherto"
5542,BOOK III.,"no one has been able to prevail against the wretch, who, in dying,"
5543,BOOK III.,renews himself like the phœnix. This account does not discourage
5544,BOOK III.,"the brothers, who again proffer their assistance."
5545,BOOK III.,
5546,BOOK III.,"Aquilant accordingly encounters Orrilo, where he keeps the way"
5547,BOOK III.,"against travellers; and he being sore pressed, flies to the tower,"
5548,BOOK III.,and turns out his crocodile.
5549,BOOK III.,
5550,BOOK III.,Gryphon now deems himself justified in assisting his brother; and
5551,BOOK III.,"the crocodile is at length slain. Orrilo, however, though often"
5552,BOOK III.,"worsted, appears to be irresistible: for though he is frequently"
5553,BOOK III.,"unhorsed, and is actually severed into two parts by one of the"
5554,BOOK III.,"brothers, he constantly re-unites himself, and renews the contest"
5555,BOOK III.,"The day is now closing, and the two brothers are in despair."
5556,BOOK III.,
5557,BOOK III.,"While things are in this state, a new performer appears upon the"
5558,BOOK III.,"theatre. This is a knight, who dragged a giant captive: but here"
5559,BOOK III.,"the author leaves Gryphon and Aquilant, as well as the knight and"
5560,BOOK III.,"his prisoner, and resumes the story of Mandricardo and Gradasso,"
5561,BOOK III.,who were left journeying together towards France.
5562,BOOK III.,
5563,BOOK III.,"This pair, after traversing various regions, arrive upon the sea-coast,"
5564,BOOK III.,where they find a lady chained and exposed upon the beach.
5565,BOOK III.,"On their interrogating her, she tells them, that she awaits the"
5566,BOOK III.,"approach of a furious Ork, who will devour her alive; and entreats"
5567,BOOK III.,"them, as an act of compassion, rather to put her to an immediate"
5568,BOOK III.,"death, than to leave her exposed to so horrible a fate. The only"
5569,BOOK III.,"favour that she requests of them, besides this dreadful grace, is,"
5570,BOOK III.,"(should they fall in with him,) to inform Norandino, king of"
5571,BOOK III.,"Damascus, of her death, and dying sentiments of affection to him."
5572,BOOK III.,
5573,BOOK III.,"The knights, however, insist on defending her, and a dreadful"
5574,BOOK III.,"conflict ensues between them and the Ork, who is represented as"
5575,BOOK III.,"something indistinct, monstrous and gigantic. Gradasso is soon"
5576,BOOK III.,"overpowered, and Mandricardo, who, in conformity to his vow, was"
5577,BOOK III.,"unprovided with a sword, is obliged to fly before the pest."
5578,BOOK III.,
5579,BOOK III.,"He, however, finds his deliverance in flight; for, speeding his"
5580,BOOK III.,"steps along the cliffs, he arrives at a frightful chasm, at which"
5581,BOOK III.,"he springs in utter desperation. The Ork following him, is unable"
5582,BOOK III.,"to clear it, and tumbles down the abyss."
5583,BOOK III.,
5584,BOOK III.,"Mandricardo quit of his foe, descends to the shore, in search of"
5585,BOOK III.,"Gradasso and Lucina, (for so was named the lady chained to the"
5586,BOOK III.,"rock,) and proceeds in company with them along the beach. From"
5587,BOOK III.,"this they behold a ship in the distance, which bears the flag of"
5588,BOOK III.,"Tibiano, king of Cyprus and Rhodes, the father of Lucina, and who"
5589,BOOK III.,"was then seeking his daughter. Lucina, overjoyed at the sight,"
5590,BOOK III.,"makes a signal of her vest, and waves the galley to the land. On"
5591,BOOK III.,"board this she embarks, together with her defenders; but the"
5592,BOOK III.,"vessel has scarcely shown her stern to the shore, when the Ork re-appears,"
5593,BOOK III.,with a monstrous fragment of a mountain on his shoulders:
5594,BOOK III.,"This he heaves into the sea, which flashes above her topmast head,"
5595,BOOK III.,and all cower at the bottom of the vessel for refuge; but the mass
5596,BOOK III.,"misses the mark at which it was hurled, and a loud land-wind"
5597,BOOK III.,"rising at the moment, the vessel is blown off to sea."
5598,BOOK III.,
5599,BOOK III.,"One danger is only substituted for another; the storm increases,"
5600,BOOK III.,"and all is darkness and dismay. In this situation, the night"
5601,BOOK III.,"closes in, during which they drift at the mercy of the winds. The"
5602,BOOK III.,succeeding day dawns upon them under better auspices; and they
5603,BOOK III.,"find themselves, in the morning, upon the shore of Acquamorta,"
5604,BOOK III.,where a mountain separates France and Spain.
5605,BOOK III.,
5606,BOOK III.,"Here they land in the neighbourhood of a cave, called Runa,"
5607,BOOK III.,without having any knowledge of the coast upon which they are
5608,BOOK III.,"cast. Leaving there Tibiano and Lucina, Gradasso and Mandricardo"
5609,BOOK III.,"proceed, armed and mounted, in search of intelligence."
5610,BOOK III.,
5611,BOOK III.,"They have not proceeded far, before they hear the noise of battle,"
5612,BOOK III.,"and pushing their horses towards the sound, find Agramant engaged"
5613,BOOK III.,with Charlemagne.
5614,BOOK III.,
5615,BOOK III.,The main story is thus brought back to the point where the
5616,BOOK III.,"christian and paynim armies were left, and where the tide of"
5617,BOOK III.,conquest was fluctuating between the hostile forces. Retiring from
5618,BOOK III.,"the medley, Ferrau had withdrawn into a neighbouring wood, and was"
5619,BOOK III.,"fishing for his helmet, in a stream in which he had lost it as he"
5620,BOOK III.,stooped to drink. At this period fortune declares decisively in
5621,BOOK III.,"favour of the infidels; and, while Rogero and Rinaldo are engaged"
5622,BOOK III.,"in a single combat on foot, Charlemagne's forces give way at all"
5623,BOOK III.,"points, in irreparable confusion."
5624,BOOK III.,
5625,BOOK III.,The duel of the two champions is interrupted by the crowd of
5626,BOOK III.,"fugitives and pursuers; and Rinaldo, now seeing Bayardo loose in"
5627,BOOK III.,"the field, attempts to get possession of him. The horse, however,"
5628,BOOK III.,"will not be taken; and Rinaldo, following him into a thick wood,"
5629,BOOK III.,"is left there by the author, who returns to Rogero."
5630,BOOK III.,
5631,BOOK III.,"Rogero was also a-foot, and grieving for the loss of his own"
5632,BOOK III.,"horse, Frontino, whom he however recovered in the rout. He now"
5633,BOOK III.,finds Bradamant and Rodomont engaged in combat. Though he knew not
5634,BOOK III.,"who they were, he could distinguish that one was a paynim, and the"
5635,BOOK III.,"other a Christian; and, moved by the spirit of courtesy,"
5636,BOOK III.,"approached them, and exclaimed, ""Let him of the two, who worships"
5637,BOOK III.,"Christ, pause, and hear what I have to say. The army of Charles is"
5638,BOOK III.,"routed, and in flight; so that if he wishes to follow his leader,"
5639,BOOK III.,"he has no time for delay."" Bradamant, who is thunderstruck with"
5640,BOOK III.,"the tidings, desires immediately to leave the field; but this is"
5641,BOOK III.,"refused by her antagonist: and Rogero, indignant at his"
5642,BOOK III.,"discourtesy, insists upon her departure, while he takes up the"
5643,BOOK III.,quarrel with Rodomont.
5644,BOOK III.,
5645,BOOK III.,"This, long and obstinately maintained on both sides, is"
5646,BOOK III.,"interrupted by the return of Bradamant, who, not being able to"
5647,BOOK III.,"overtake the fugitives, and being divided in her feelings, as to"
5648,BOOK III.,"what she owed on the one side to her emperor, and on the other to"
5649,BOOK III.,"the stranger who had so generously taken her part, yields at last"
5650,BOOK III.,"to what was the stronger impulse, and comes back to his"
5651,BOOK III.,assistance.
5652,BOOK III.,
5653,BOOK III.,"She arrives, however, when he was least in need of it; and when he"
5654,BOOK III.,"had smote his enemy such a blow, as obliged him to drop both his"
5655,BOOK III.,"sword and bridle. Rogero, however, disdaining to profit by his"
5656,BOOK III.,"defenceless situation, sate apart upon his horse, whilst that of"
5657,BOOK III.,"Rodomont bore his rider, stunned and stupefied, about the field."
5658,BOOK III.,
5659,BOOK III.,Rogero was at this juncture approached by Bradamant; who conceived
5660,BOOK III.,"a yet higher notion of his valour, on beholding such an instance"
5661,BOOK III.,"of forbearance. She addressed him, by excusing herself for leaving"
5662,BOOK III.,"him exposed to an enemy from his interference in her cause,"
5663,BOOK III.,pleading her attachment to her sovereign as the motive; and was
5664,BOOK III.,"engaged in conference with him, when Rodomont recovered from his"
5665,BOOK III.,"confusion. His bearing was however changed, and he disclaimed all"
5666,BOOK III.,"thoughts of further contest with one ""who he said, had already"
5667,BOOK III.,"vanquished him by his courtesy."" So saying, he quitted his"
5668,BOOK III.,"antagonist, picked up his sword, and spurred out of sight."
5669,BOOK III.,
5670,BOOK III.,"Bradamant was now again desirous of retiring from the field, and"
5671,BOOK III.,"Rogero insisted on accompanying her, though yet unconscious of her"
5672,BOOK III.,sex.
5673,BOOK III.,
5674,BOOK III.,"As they pursued their way, she enquired the name and quality of"
5675,BOOK III.,her new associate; and Rogero informed her of his nation and
5676,BOOK III.,"family. Beginning from the destruction of Troy, he told her that"
5677,BOOK III.,"Astyanax, who was preserved by a stratagem of the Greeks, having"
5678,BOOK III.,"established the kingdom of Messina, in Sicily, perished by the"
5679,BOOK III.,"treachery of a priest, named Œgystus. The widow of this prince,"
5680,BOOK III.,"being then big with child, flying from her enemies, escaped to"
5681,BOOK III.,"Rheggio. Here she brought forth a son, who was christened"
5682,BOOK III.,"Polydore. From this Polydore descended Polydantes, and from him"
5683,BOOK III.,"twin branches, who gave origin to two other families of renown."
5684,BOOK III.,From one of these sprang the royal race of Pepin and Charlemagne;
5685,BOOK III.,"and from the other, two illustrious houses, one of which took root"
5686,BOOK III.,"at Rheggio, ('once called Risa') and the other at Ancona. ""From"
5687,BOOK III.,"that of Rheggio am I derived,"" continued he; ""and am son of"
5688,BOOK III.,"Rogero, the son of Agolant and Gallicella. She flying when big"
5689,BOOK III.,"with me, from a horrible persecution which she endured during the"
5690,BOOK III.,"absence of her husband, then engaged in war, brought me forth in a"
5691,BOOK III.,"foreign land, and died in giving me life. It was here that a"
5692,BOOK III.,"magician took charge of me, who trained me to feats of arms amidst"
5693,BOOK III.,"the dangers of the desert and of the chace."""
5694,BOOK III.,
5695,BOOK III.,"Having thus ended his tale, Rogero entreated a similar return of"
5696,BOOK III.,"courtesy from his companion; who replied, without disguise, that"
5697,BOOK III.,"she was of the race of Clermont, and sister to Rinaldo, the fame"
5698,BOOK III.,"of whom was perhaps known to him. Rogero, much moved by this"
5699,BOOK III.,"intelligence, entreats her to take off her helmet; and, at the"
5700,BOOK III.,"discovery of her face, remains transported with pleasure."
5701,BOOK III.,
5702,BOOK III.,"Whilst he is contemplating this with rapture, an unexpected danger"
5703,BOOK III.,"hangs over the future lovers. A party which was placed in a wood,"
5704,BOOK III.,"in order to intercept the retreating Christians, breaks from its"
5705,BOOK III.,"ambush upon the pair; and Bradamant, who was uncasqued, is wounded"
5706,BOOK III.,"in the head. Rogero is in fury at this attack; and Bradamant,"
5707,BOOK III.,"replacing her helmet, joins him in taking speedy vengeance on"
5708,BOOK III.,"their enemies. Of these they clear the field, but separate in the"
5709,BOOK III.,pursuit; and the author first resumes the story of Rogero.
5710,BOOK III.,
5711,BOOK III.,"Quitting the chace, and wandering by hill and vale, in search of"
5712,BOOK III.,"her whom he had no sooner found than lost, Rogero now falls in"
5713,BOOK III.,"with two knights, whom he joins, and who promise to assist him in"
5714,BOOK III.,"the search of his companion, whose arms he describes, concealing,"
5715,BOOK III.,"from a vague feeling of jealousy, her quality and sex."
5716,BOOK III.,
5717,BOOK III.,"It was evening when they joined company, and having journeyed"
5718,BOOK III.,"together through the night, the morning was beginning to break,"
5719,BOOK III.,"when one of the strangers, fixing his eyes upon Rogero's shield,"
5720,BOOK III.,demanded of him by what right he bore the device pourtrayed upon
5721,BOOK III.,"it. Rogero, in return interrogated the enquirer as to his"
5722,BOOK III.,"pretensions to the bearing of Hector, who proclaimed himself to be"
5723,BOOK III.,"Mandricardo, declared how he had won it, and proposed that arms"
5724,BOOK III.,should decide which of the two was most worthy to bear the symbol
5725,BOOK III.,of the Trojan knight.
5726,BOOK III.,
5727,BOOK III.,"Rogero felt no other objection to this proposal, than the scruple"
5728,BOOK III.,"which rose out of the observation, that his antagonist was without"
5729,BOOK III.,"a sword. Mandricardo, however, insisted that this need be no"
5730,BOOK III.,"impediment; and then informed him of the vow which he had taken,"
5731,BOOK III.,never to wear a sword till he had completed the acquisition of
5732,BOOK III.,Hector's arms by the conquest of Durindana.
5733,BOOK III.,
5734,BOOK III.,"This was no sooner said, than a new antagonist started up in"
5735,BOOK III.,"Gradasso, in whom the reader will have recognised the companion of"
5736,BOOK III.,Mandricardo. Gradasso now vindicates his prior right to the quest
5737,BOOK III.,"of Durindana, to obtain which he had embarked (as was related in"
5738,BOOK III.,the beginning) in that fearful war upon France. A quarrel is thus
5739,BOOK III.,kindled between the kings of Tartary and Sericane. Mandricardo
5740,BOOK III.,"uproots a young elm-tree, to supply the place of a sword; and"
5741,BOOK III.,"Gradasso, disdaining to combat with unequal weapons, arms himself"
5742,BOOK III.,"with a pine. Being thus furnished for offence, they encounter one"
5743,BOOK III.,"another with fury, while Rogero laughs and looks upon the strife."
5744,BOOK III.,
5745,BOOK III.,"He, nevertheless, several times attempts to separate the"
5746,BOOK III.,"combatants, but always without success. While the conflict is thus"
5747,BOOK III.,"raging, a knight arrives upon the ground, accompanied by a damsel,"
5748,BOOK III.,to whom Rogero relates the cause and progress of the strife. This
5749,BOOK III.,"turns out to be Brandimart, accompanied by Flordelis. He also"
5750,BOOK III.,"interposes his mediation, and succeeds better in bringing the two"
5751,BOOK III.,"champions to accord. This he affects, by informing them that he"
5752,BOOK III.,"can conduct them to the presence of Orlando, the master of"
5753,BOOK III.,Durindana.
5754,BOOK III.,
5755,BOOK III.,"""If,"" said he, ""you can heal him of a strange enchantment, it is"
5756,BOOK III.,from him that you may claim the sword; nor is he one who will
5757,BOOK III.,"refuse you a fair field for obtaining it. Two leagues from hence,"""
5758,BOOK III.,"continued Brandimart, ""is a water, called the _River of Laughter_,"
5759,BOOK III.,but which would be better entitled _the Stream of Tears_. Here
5760,BOOK III.,"Orlando is enchanted. An African magician made this known to me,"
5761,BOOK III.,"and I had already disposed myself to free him, or perish by his"
5762,BOOK III.,"side, but being insufficient by myself for such an enterprise,"
5763,BOOK III.,Heaven has willed that I should light upon you to assist me in the
5764,BOOK III.,"attempt."""
5765,BOOK III.,
5766,BOOK III.,"Gradasso and Mandricardo instantly make truce, in order to"
5767,BOOK III.,"accompany Brandimart in his quest, nor will Rogero be left behind."
5768,BOOK III.,
5769,BOOK III.,"This resolution, however, gave rise to a serious difficulty; for"
5770,BOOK III.,"the number to be employed in the adventure was to be unequal, as"
5771,BOOK III.,Brandimart was instructed; and one must therefore necessarily be
5772,BOOK III.,"rejected. Who should be rejected, it was now determined to decide"
5773,BOOK III.,"by lot; and chance pronounced against Mandricardo, who departed"
5774,BOOK III.,"with reluctance from the field, and wandering long, arrived at"
5775,BOOK III.,"last in Agramant's camp, who had sate down before Paris."
5776,BOOK III.,
5777,BOOK III.,"The story of Orlando is now resumed, where it was left by the"
5778,BOOK III.,author at the conclusion of the second book. The count having
5779,BOOK III.,"plunged into the fountain, termed the River of Laughter, is so"
5780,BOOK III.,"delighted with the company of Naiads, and with the pleasures which"
5781,BOOK III.,"he finds beneath the waters, that he remains there a willing"
5782,BOOK III.,prisoner.
5783,BOOK III.,
5784,BOOK III.,"About this water extended an enchanted wood, thick with evergreen"
5785,BOOK III.,"trees; and here arrived Rogero, Gradasso, Brandimart, and"
5786,BOOK III.,"Flordelis, determined to attempt the deliverance of Orlando."
5787,BOOK III.,
5788,BOOK III.,"This forest seemed impenetrable; but by the advice of Flordelis,"
5789,BOOK III.,"the knights descended from their horses, and determined to cut"
5790,BOOK III.,"themselves a passage. Rogero, in pursuance of this resolution,"
5791,BOOK III.,hews down a laurel with his sword. The tree is no sooner
5792,BOOK III.,"overthrown, than a beautiful damsel starts from its trunk, and"
5793,BOOK III.,"claims the compassion of the knight. She informs him, that the"
5794,BOOK III.,"trees which he beholds, as well as that which he has felled,"
5795,BOOK III.,"contain sister nymphs, the victims of enchantment; the nature of"
5796,BOOK III.,"which is such that they remain transformed till liberated, as she"
5797,BOOK III.,"had been, by the destruction of the plant in which they are"
5798,BOOK III.,"imprisoned. ""This deliverance is, however, as yet incomplete,"""
5799,BOOK III.,"pursued the damsel; ""and, to perfect it, you must accompany me to"
5800,BOOK III.,"the water, if you would not see me again rooted in the forest."""
5801,BOOK III.,"Rogero yields to her prayer, accompanies her to the water, and,"
5802,BOOK III.,"seduced by the enchantment, leaps hand in hand with her into the"
5803,BOOK III.,fountain.
5804,BOOK III.,
5805,BOOK III.,"In the meantime, Gradasso, attempting to clear his way, cuts down"
5806,BOOK III.,"an ash, which is converted into a courser. He immediately mounts"
5807,BOOK III.,"it; when the horse transports him through the air, and plunges"
5808,BOOK III.,"with him into the enchanted stream, where he remains a prisoner"
5809,BOOK III.,with the rest.*
5810,BOOK III.,
5811,BOOK III.,"* The reader will see in this adventure, more especially in the"
5812,BOOK III.,"author's fitting the temptations to the character of the knights,"
5813,BOOK III.,the hint which Tasso turned to so much better account in his
5814,BOOK III.,creation of the forest of Armida.
5815,BOOK III.,
5816,BOOK III.,"Brandimart, counselled by Flordelis, pursues the adventure with"
5817,BOOK III.,better success; and resisting every species of temptation which is
5818,BOOK III.,"presented to him, at length arrives at the banks of the fountain."
5819,BOOK III.,"Here, however, he would have yielded to the same fascination as"
5820,BOOK III.,"the others, but for the wise precautions of Flordelis,—"
5821,BOOK III.,
5822,BOOK III.,"Who, for a safeguard, round his brow disposes"
5823,BOOK III.,A mystic garland of enchanted roses.*
5824,BOOK III.,
5825,BOOK III.,"* The idea of roses being a solvent of enchantments, is as old as"
5826,BOOK III.,"Apuleius and Lucian; and, like most of the mysticisms to be found"
5827,BOOK III.,"in those authors, is probably to be traced to a much more ancient"
5828,BOOK III.,source.
5829,BOOK III.,
5830,BOOK III.,She had also furnished him with the same ornaments for the others
5831,BOOK III.,"whom he was to deliver from the pool. Armed with these wreaths, he"
5832,BOOK III.,"approaches the knights, whom he finds in the bowers of crystal,"
5833,BOOK III.,"into which he plunged, and crowns them with the garlands. The"
5834,BOOK III.,"charm forthwith operates; their perverse inclination ceases, and"
5835,BOOK III.,they gladly return with their deliverer to the surface.
5836,BOOK III.,
5837,BOOK III.,"They are scarcely safe from the spell, when Gradasso bethinks him"
5838,BOOK III.,"of his long quest, and a fierce battle ensues between him and"
5839,BOOK III.,"Orlando, for the possession of Durindana. They are, however,"
5840,BOOK III.,"induced to suspend this by the instances of their companions, and"
5841,BOOK III.,"the entreaties of a stranger dwarf, who appears, mounted on a"
5842,BOOK III.,"palfrey, and entreats the assistance of some of the knights."
5843,BOOK III.,
5844,BOOK III.,"These accordingly divide; Orlando, attended by Brandimart and"
5845,BOOK III.,"Flordelis, taking his way towards Paris, and Rogero and Gradasso"
5846,BOOK III.,accompanying the dwarf.
5847,BOOK III.,
5848,BOOK III.,"The author accompanies Orlando and his friends, who arrive before"
5849,BOOK III.,"Paris, besieged by the forces of Agramant, amid whose ranks were"
5850,BOOK III.,"to be found assembled, Rodomont, Mandricardo, Ferrau, the newly"
5851,BOOK III.,"arrived Gradasso, and all the worthies of the paynim army."
5852,BOOK III.,"Flordelis now retires into a wood for safety, while the two"
5853,BOOK III.,champions approach the camp of the besiegers. At this crisis
5854,BOOK III.,"Charlemagne makes a desperate sally, which is seconded by Orlando"
5855,BOOK III.,"and Brandimart, and the fortune of the day seems balanced between"
5856,BOOK III.,the contending troops.
5857,BOOK III.,
5858,BOOK III.,"The author here leaves things thus suspended, and takes up the"
5859,BOOK III.,"story of Bradamant, who lately separated form Rogero, in repulsing"
5860,BOOK III.,"the ambuscade of the paynims. She journeying alone, and still"
5861,BOOK III.,"suffering from her wound, at length reaches a hermitage, the"
5862,BOOK III.,"tenant of which examines her head, cuts off her hair and with this"
5863,BOOK III.,"bandages, and finally heals the gash which she had received."
5864,BOOK III.,
5865,BOOK III.,"Departing from his hermitage, and still pursuing her way alone,"
5866,BOOK III.,"she alights from her horse, and reposes herself in a wood, where"
5867,BOOK III.,"she is surprised sleeping by Flordespina, who, deceived by the"
5868,BOOK III.,"appearance of her hair, takes her for a man. This princess, who"
5869,BOOK III.,"was engaged with her damsels in the chase, by a stratagem detains"
5870,BOOK III.,"Bradamant in the forest, where they pursue their sports in"
5871,BOOK III.,company.
5872,BOOK III.,
5873,BOOK III.,"But, exclaims the poet, while I sing these lays of ladies and of"
5874,BOOK III.,"loves, I see France arming against Italy, and the horizon bright"
5875,BOOK III.,"with flames. Hereafter, if it shall be permitted me I will piece"
5876,BOOK III.,the tale which I leave unfinished.
