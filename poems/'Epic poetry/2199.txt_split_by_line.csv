50,BOOK I.,The quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles—Achilles withdraws
51,BOOK I.,"from the war, and sends his mother Thetis to ask Jove to help the"
52,BOOK I.,Trojans—Scene between Jove and Juno on Olympus.
53,BOOK I.,
54,BOOK I.,"Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that"
55,BOOK I.,brought countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did
56,BOOK I.,"it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a"
57,BOOK I.,"prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove"
58,BOOK I.,"fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men,"
59,BOOK I.,"and great Achilles, first fell out with one another."
60,BOOK I.,
61,BOOK I.,And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was
62,BOOK I.,the son of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent
63,BOOK I.,"a pestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son"
64,BOOK I.,of Atreus had dishonoured Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had
65,BOOK I.,"come to the ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and had"
66,BOOK I.,brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the
67,BOOK I.,"sceptre of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant’s wreath, and he"
68,BOOK I.,"besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus,"
69,BOOK I.,who were their chiefs.
70,BOOK I.,
71,BOOK I.,"“Sons of Atreus,” he cried, “and all other Achaeans, may the gods"
72,BOOK I.,"who dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to"
73,BOOK I.,"reach your homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a"
74,BOOK I.,"ransom for her, in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove.”"
75,BOOK I.,
76,BOOK I.,On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for
77,BOOK I.,respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but
78,BOOK I.,"not so Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly"
79,BOOK I.,"away. “Old man,” said he, “let me not find you tarrying about our"
80,BOOK I.,"ships, nor yet coming hereafter. Your sceptre of the god and your"
81,BOOK I.,wreath shall profit you nothing. I will not free her. She shall
82,BOOK I.,"grow old in my house at Argos far from her own home, busying"
83,BOOK I.,"herself with her loom and visiting my couch; so go, and do not"
84,BOOK I.,provoke me or it shall be the worse for you.”
85,BOOK I.,
86,BOOK I.,"The old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went"
87,BOOK I.,by the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo
88,BOOK I.,"whom lovely Leto had borne. “Hear me,” he cried, “O god of the"
89,BOOK I.,"silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest"
90,BOOK I.,"Tenedos with thy might, hear me oh thou of Sminthe. If I have"
91,BOOK I.,"ever decked your temple with garlands, or burned your thigh-bones"
92,BOOK I.,"in fat of bulls or goats, grant my prayer, and let your arrows"
93,BOOK I.,avenge these my tears upon the Danaans.”
94,BOOK I.,
95,BOOK I.,"Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down"
96,BOOK I.,"furious from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver"
97,BOOK I.,"upon his shoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the"
98,BOOK I.,rage that trembled within him. He sat himself down away from the
99,BOOK I.,"ships with a face as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death"
100,BOOK I.,as he shot his arrow in the midst of them. First he smote their
101,BOOK I.,"mules and their hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the"
102,BOOK I.,"people themselves, and all day long the pyres of the dead were"
103,BOOK I.,burning.
104,BOOK I.,
105,BOOK I.,"For nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon"
106,BOOK I.,the tenth day Achilles called them in assembly—moved thereto by
107,BOOK I.,"Juno, who saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had"
108,BOOK I.,"compassion upon them. Then, when they were got together, he rose"
109,BOOK I.,and spoke among them.
110,BOOK I.,
111,BOOK I.,"“Son of Atreus,” said he, “I deem that we should now turn roving"
112,BOOK I.,"home if we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by"
113,BOOK I.,"war and pestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or"
114,BOOK I.,"some reader of dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell"
115,BOOK I.,"us why Phoebus Apollo is so angry, and say whether it is for some"
116,BOOK I.,"vow that we have broken, or hecatomb that we have not offered,"
117,BOOK I.,and whether he will accept the savour of lambs and goats without
118,BOOK I.,"blemish, so as to take away the plague from us.”"
119,BOOK I.,
120,BOOK I.,"With these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest"
121,BOOK I.,"of augurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to"
122,BOOK I.,speak. He it was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to
123,BOOK I.,"Ilius, through the prophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had"
124,BOOK I.,inspired him. With all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them
125,BOOK I.,thus:—
126,BOOK I.,
127,BOOK I.,"“Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger"
128,BOOK I.,"of King Apollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and"
129,BOOK I.,"swear that you will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I"
130,BOOK I.,"know that I shall offend one who rules the Argives with might, to"
131,BOOK I.,whom all the Achaeans are in subjection. A plain man cannot stand
132,BOOK I.,"against the anger of a king, who if he swallow his displeasure"
133,BOOK I.,"now, will yet nurse revenge till he has wreaked it. Consider,"
134,BOOK I.,"therefore, whether or no you will protect me.”"
135,BOOK I.,
136,BOOK I.,"And Achilles answered, “Fear not, but speak as it is borne in"
137,BOOK I.,"upon you from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray,"
138,BOOK I.,"and whose oracles you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships"
139,BOOK I.,"shall lay his hand upon you, while I yet live to look upon the"
140,BOOK I.,"face of the earth—no, not though you name Agamemnon himself, who"
141,BOOK I.,is by far the foremost of the Achaeans.”
142,BOOK I.,
143,BOOK I.,"Thereon the seer spoke boldly. “The god,” he said, “is angry"
144,BOOK I.,"neither about vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest’s sake, whom"
145,BOOK I.,"Agamemnon has dishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter"
146,BOOK I.,nor take a ransom for her; therefore has he sent these evils upon
147,BOOK I.,"us, and will yet send others. He will not deliver the Danaans"
148,BOOK I.,from this pestilence till Agamemnon has restored the girl without
149,BOOK I.,"fee or ransom to her father, and has sent a holy hecatomb to"
150,BOOK I.,Chryse. Thus we may perhaps appease him.”
151,BOOK I.,
152,BOOK I.,"With these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His"
153,BOOK I.,"heart was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he"
154,BOOK I.,"scowled on Calchas and said, “Seer of evil, you never yet"
155,BOOK I.,"prophesied smooth things concerning me, but have ever loved to"
156,BOOK I.,foretell that which was evil. You have brought me neither comfort
157,BOOK I.,"nor performance; and now you come seeing among Danaans, and"
158,BOOK I.,saying that Apollo has plagued us because I would not take a
159,BOOK I.,"ransom for this girl, the daughter of Chryses. I have set my"
160,BOOK I.,"heart on keeping her in my own house, for I love her better even"
161,BOOK I.,"than my own wife Clytemnestra, whose peer she is alike in form"
162,BOOK I.,"and feature, in understanding and accomplishments. Still I will"
163,BOOK I.,"give her up if I must, for I would have the people live, not die;"
164,BOOK I.,"but you must find me a prize instead, or I alone among the"
165,BOOK I.,"Argives shall be without one. This is not well; for you behold,"
166,BOOK I.,"all of you, that my prize is to go elsewhither.”"
167,BOOK I.,
168,BOOK I.,"And Achilles answered, “Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond"
169,BOOK I.,"all mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We"
170,BOOK I.,have no common store from which to take one. Those we took from
171,BOOK I.,the cities have been awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that
172,BOOK I.,"have been made already. Give this girl, therefore, to the god,"
173,BOOK I.,and if ever Jove grants us to sack the city of Troy we will
174,BOOK I.,requite you three and fourfold.”
175,BOOK I.,
176,BOOK I.,"Then Agamemnon said, “Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall"
177,BOOK I.,not thus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not
178,BOOK I.,"persuade me. Are you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely"
179,BOOK I.,under my loss and give up the girl at your bidding? Let the
180,BOOK I.,"Achaeans find me a prize in fair exchange to my liking, or I will"
181,BOOK I.,"come and take your own, or that of Ajax or of Ulysses; and he to"
182,BOOK I.,whomsoever I may come shall rue my coming. But of this we will
183,BOOK I.,"take thought hereafter; for the present, let us draw a ship into"
184,BOOK I.,"the sea, and find a crew for her expressly; let us put a hecatomb"
185,BOOK I.,"on board, and let us send Chryseis also; further, let some chief"
186,BOOK I.,"man among us be in command, either Ajax, or Idomeneus, or"
187,BOOK I.,"yourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you are, that we may"
188,BOOK I.,offer sacrifice and appease the anger of the god.”
189,BOOK I.,
190,BOOK I.,"Achilles scowled at him and answered, “You are steeped in"
191,BOOK I.,insolence and lust of gain. With what heart can any of the
192,BOOK I.,"Achaeans do your bidding, either on foray or in open fighting? I"
193,BOOK I.,came not warring here for any ill the Trojans had done me. I have
194,BOOK I.,no quarrel with them. They have not raided my cattle nor my
195,BOOK I.,"horses, nor cut down my harvests on the rich plains of Phthia;"
196,BOOK I.,"for between me and them there is a great space, both mountain and"
197,BOOK I.,"sounding sea. We have followed you, Sir Insolence! for your"
198,BOOK I.,"pleasure, not ours—to gain satisfaction from the Trojans for your"
199,BOOK I.,"shameless self and for Menelaus. You forget this, and threaten to"
200,BOOK I.,"rob me of the prize for which I have toiled, and which the sons"
201,BOOK I.,of the Achaeans have given me. Never when the Achaeans sack any
202,BOOK I.,"rich city of the Trojans do I receive so good a prize as you do,"
203,BOOK I.,though it is my hands that do the better part of the fighting.
204,BOOK I.,"When the sharing comes, your share is far the largest, and I,"
205,BOOK I.,"forsooth, must go back to my ships, take what I can get and be"
206,BOOK I.,"thankful, when my labour of fighting is done. Now, therefore, I"
207,BOOK I.,shall go back to Phthia; it will be much better for me to return
208,BOOK I.,"home with my ships, for I will not stay here dishonoured to"
209,BOOK I.,gather gold and substance for you.”
210,BOOK I.,
211,BOOK I.,"And Agamemnon answered, “Fly if you will, I shall make you no"
212,BOOK I.,"prayers to stay you. I have others here who will do me honour,"
213,BOOK I.,"and above all Jove, the lord of counsel. There is no king here so"
214,BOOK I.,"hateful to me as you are, for you are ever quarrelsome and"
215,BOOK I.,ill-affected. What though you be brave? Was it not heaven that
216,BOOK I.,"made you so? Go home, then, with your ships and comrades to lord"
217,BOOK I.,it over the Myrmidons. I care neither for you nor for your anger;
218,BOOK I.,and thus will I do: since Phoebus Apollo is taking Chryseis from
219,BOOK I.,"me, I shall send her with my ship and my followers, but I shall"
220,BOOK I.,"come to your tent and take your own prize Briseis, that you may"
221,BOOK I.,"learn how much stronger I am than you are, and that another may"
222,BOOK I.,fear to set himself up as equal or comparable with me.”
223,BOOK I.,
224,BOOK I.,"The son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggy"
225,BOOK I.,"breast was divided whether to draw his sword, push the others"
226,BOOK I.,"aside, and kill the son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and"
227,BOOK I.,"check his anger. While he was thus in two minds, and was drawing"
228,BOOK I.,"his mighty sword from its scabbard, Minerva came down from heaven"
229,BOOK I.,"(for Juno had sent her in the love she bore to them both), and"
230,BOOK I.,"seized the son of Peleus by his yellow hair, visible to him"
231,BOOK I.,"alone, for of the others no man could see her. Achilles turned in"
232,BOOK I.,"amaze, and by the fire that flashed from her eyes at once knew"
233,BOOK I.,"that she was Minerva. “Why are you here,” said he, “daughter of"
234,BOOK I.,"aegis-bearing Jove? To see the pride of Agamemnon, son of Atreus?"
235,BOOK I.,Let me tell you—and it shall surely be—he shall pay for this
236,BOOK I.,insolence with his life.”
237,BOOK I.,
238,BOOK I.,"And Minerva said, “I come from heaven, if you will hear me, to"
239,BOOK I.,"bid you stay your anger. Juno has sent me, who cares for both of"
240,BOOK I.,"you alike. Cease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your"
241,BOOK I.,"sword; rail at him if you will, and your railing will not be"
242,BOOK I.,"vain, for I tell you—and it shall surely be—that you shall"
243,BOOK I.,hereafter receive gifts three times as splendid by reason of this
244,BOOK I.,"present insult. Hold, therefore, and obey.”"
245,BOOK I.,
246,BOOK I.,"“Goddess,” answered Achilles, “however angry a man may be, he"
247,BOOK I.,"must do as you two command him. This will be best, for the gods"
248,BOOK I.,ever hear the prayers of him who has obeyed them.”
249,BOOK I.,
250,BOOK I.,"He stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust it"
251,BOOK I.,back into the scabbard as Minerva bade him. Then she went back to
252,BOOK I.,"Olympus among the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing"
253,BOOK I.,Jove.
254,BOOK I.,
255,BOOK I.,"But the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus,"
256,BOOK I.,"for he was still in a rage. “Wine-bibber,” he cried, “with the"
257,BOOK I.,"face of a dog and the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out"
258,BOOK I.,"with the host in fight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade."
259,BOOK I.,You shun this as you do death itself. You had rather go round and
260,BOOK I.,rob his prizes from any man who contradicts you. You devour your
261,BOOK I.,"people, for you are king over a feeble folk; otherwise, son of"
262,BOOK I.,"Atreus, henceforward you would insult no man. Therefore I say,"
263,BOOK I.,"and swear it with a great oath—nay, by this my sceptre which"
264,BOOK I.,"shalt sprout neither leaf nor shoot, nor bud anew from the day on"
265,BOOK I.,which it left its parent stem upon the mountains—for the axe
266,BOOK I.,"stripped it of leaf and bark, and now the sons of the Achaeans"
267,BOOK I.,bear it as judges and guardians of the decrees of heaven—so
268,BOOK I.,surely and solemnly do I swear that hereafter they shall look
269,BOOK I.,fondly for Achilles and shall not find him. In the day of your
270,BOOK I.,"distress, when your men fall dying by the murderous hand of"
271,BOOK I.,"Hector, you shall not know how to help them, and shall rend your"
272,BOOK I.,heart with rage for the hour when you offered insult to the
273,BOOK I.,bravest of the Achaeans.”
274,BOOK I.,
275,BOOK I.,With this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on
276,BOOK I.,"the ground and took his seat, while the son of Atreus was"
277,BOOK I.,beginning fiercely from his place upon the other side. Then
278,BOOK I.,"uprose smooth-tongued Nestor, the facile speaker of the Pylians,"
279,BOOK I.,and the words fell from his lips sweeter than honey. Two
280,BOOK I.,generations of men born and bred in Pylos had passed away under
281,BOOK I.,"his rule, and he was now reigning over the third. With all"
282,BOOK I.,"sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:—"
283,BOOK I.,
284,BOOK I.,"“Of a truth,” he said, “a great sorrow has befallen the Achaean"
285,BOOK I.,"land. Surely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans"
286,BOOK I.,"be glad at heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two,"
287,BOOK I.,who are so excellent in fight and counsel. I am older than either
288,BOOK I.,of you; therefore be guided by me. Moreover I have been the
289,BOOK I.,"familiar friend of men even greater than you are, and they did"
290,BOOK I.,not disregard my counsels. Never again can I behold such men as
291,BOOK I.,"Pirithous and Dryas shepherd of his people, or as Caeneus,"
292,BOOK I.,"Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus son of Aegeus, peer of"
293,BOOK I.,the immortals. These were the mightiest men ever born upon this
294,BOOK I.,"earth: mightiest were they, and when they fought the fiercest"
295,BOOK I.,tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them. I came
296,BOOK I.,"from distant Pylos, and went about among them, for they would"
297,BOOK I.,"have me come, and I fought as it was in me to do. Not a man now"
298,BOOK I.,"living could withstand them, but they heard my words, and were"
299,BOOK I.,"persuaded by them. So be it also with yourselves, for this is the"
300,BOOK I.,"more excellent way. Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong,"
301,BOOK I.,"take not this girl away, for the sons of the Achaeans have"
302,BOOK I.,"already given her to Achilles; and you, Achilles, strive not"
303,BOOK I.,"further with the king, for no man who by the grace of Jove wields"
304,BOOK I.,"a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon. You are strong, and"
305,BOOK I.,have a goddess for your mother; but Agamemnon is stronger than
306,BOOK I.,"you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus, check your"
307,BOOK I.,"anger, I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, who in the"
308,BOOK I.,day of battle is a tower of strength to the Achaeans.”
309,BOOK I.,
310,BOOK I.,"And Agamemnon answered, “Sir, all that you have said is true, but"
311,BOOK I.,this fellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be
312,BOOK I.,"lord of all, king of all, and captain of all, and this shall"
313,BOOK I.,"hardly be. Granted that the gods have made him a great warrior,"
314,BOOK I.,have they also given him the right to speak with railing?”
315,BOOK I.,
316,BOOK I.,"Achilles interrupted him. “I should be a mean coward,” he cried,"
317,BOOK I.,“were I to give in to you in all things. Order other people
318,BOOK I.,"about, not me, for I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say—and"
319,BOOK I.,lay my saying to your heart—I shall fight neither you nor any man
320,BOOK I.,"about this girl, for those that take were those also that gave."
321,BOOK I.,But of all else that is at my ship you shall carry away nothing
322,BOOK I.,"by force. Try, that others may see; if you do, my spear shall be"
323,BOOK I.,reddened with your blood.”
324,BOOK I.,
325,BOOK I.,"When they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up"
326,BOOK I.,the assembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went
327,BOOK I.,back to his tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his
328,BOOK I.,"company, while Agamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a"
329,BOOK I.,crew of twenty oarsmen. He escorted Chryseis on board and sent
330,BOOK I.,moreover a hecatomb for the god. And Ulysses went as captain.
331,BOOK I.,
332,BOOK I.,"These, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea."
333,BOOK I.,But the son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they
334,BOOK I.,purified themselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then they
335,BOOK I.,offered hecatombs of bulls and goats without blemish on the
336,BOOK I.,"sea-shore, and the smoke with the savour of their sacrifice rose"
337,BOOK I.,curling up towards heaven.
338,BOOK I.,
339,BOOK I.,Thus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon
340,BOOK I.,"did not forget the threat that he had made Achilles, and called"
341,BOOK I.,"his trusty messengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. “Go,”"
342,BOOK I.,"said he, “to the tent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by"
343,BOOK I.,the hand and bring her hither; if he will not give her I shall
344,BOOK I.,come with others and take her—which will press him harder.”
345,BOOK I.,
346,BOOK I.,"He charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon"
347,BOOK I.,"they went their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came to"
348,BOOK I.,the tents and ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting
349,BOOK I.,"by his tent and his ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld"
350,BOOK I.,"them. They stood fearfully and reverently before him, and never a"
351,BOOK I.,"word did they speak, but he knew them and said, “Welcome,"
352,BOOK I.,"heralds, messengers of gods and men; draw near; my quarrel is not"
353,BOOK I.,with you but with Agamemnon who has sent you for the girl
354,BOOK I.,"Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus, bring her and give her to them,"
355,BOOK I.,"but let them be witnesses by the blessed gods, by mortal men, and"
356,BOOK I.,"by the fierceness of Agamemnon’s anger, that if ever again there"
357,BOOK I.,"be need of me to save the people from ruin, they shall seek and"
358,BOOK I.,they shall not find. Agamemnon is mad with rage and knows not how
359,BOOK I.,to look before and after that the Achaeans may fight by their
360,BOOK I.,ships in safety.”
361,BOOK I.,
362,BOOK I.,Patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought
363,BOOK I.,"Briseis from the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took"
364,BOOK I.,her with them to the ships of the Achaeans—and the woman was loth
365,BOOK I.,"to go. Then Achilles went all alone by the side of the hoar sea,"
366,BOOK I.,weeping and looking out upon the boundless waste of waters. He
367,BOOK I.,"raised his hands in prayer to his immortal mother, “Mother,” he"
368,BOOK I.,"cried, “you bore me doomed to live but for a little season;"
369,BOOK I.,"surely Jove, who thunders from Olympus, might have made that"
370,BOOK I.,"little glorious. It is not so. Agamemnon, son of Atreus, has done"
371,BOOK I.,"me dishonour, and has robbed me of my prize by force.”"

373,BOOK I.,"As he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was"
374,BOOK I.,sitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father.
375,BOOK I.,"Forthwith she rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat"
376,BOOK I.,"down before him as he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand,"
377,BOOK I.,"and said, “My son, why are you weeping? What is it that grieves"
378,BOOK I.,"you? Keep it not from me, but tell me, that we may know it"
379,BOOK I.,together.”
380,BOOK I.,
381,BOOK I.,"Achilles drew a deep sigh and said, “You know it; why tell you"
382,BOOK I.,what you know well already? We went to Thebe the strong city of
383,BOOK I.,"Eetion, sacked it, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of the"
384,BOOK I.,"Achaeans shared it duly among themselves, and chose lovely"
385,BOOK I.,"Chryseis as the meed of Agamemnon; but Chryses, priest of Apollo,"
386,BOOK I.,"came to the ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, and"
387,BOOK I.,brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the
388,BOOK I.,"sceptre of Apollo, wreathed with a suppliant’s wreath, and he"
389,BOOK I.,"besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus who"
390,BOOK I.,were their chiefs.
391,BOOK I.,
392,BOOK I.,“On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for
393,BOOK I.,respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but
394,BOOK I.,"not so Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly"
395,BOOK I.,"away. So he went back in anger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly,"
396,BOOK I.,heard his prayer. Then the god sent a deadly dart upon the
397,BOOK I.,"Argives, and the people died thick on one another, for the arrows"
398,BOOK I.,went everywhither among the wide host of the Achaeans. At last a
399,BOOK I.,seer in the fulness of his knowledge declared to us the oracles
400,BOOK I.,"of Apollo, and I was myself first to say that we should appease"
401,BOOK I.,"him. Whereon the son of Atreus rose in anger, and threatened that"
402,BOOK I.,which he has since done. The Achaeans are now taking the girl in
403,BOOK I.,"a ship to Chryse, and sending gifts of sacrifice to the god; but"
404,BOOK I.,"the heralds have just taken from my tent the daughter of Briseus,"
405,BOOK I.,whom the Achaeans had awarded to myself.
406,BOOK I.,
407,BOOK I.,"“Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus,"
408,BOOK I.,"and if you have ever done him service in word or deed, implore"
409,BOOK I.,the aid of Jove. Ofttimes in my father’s house have I heard you
410,BOOK I.,glory in that you alone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn
411,BOOK I.,"from ruin, when the others, with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas"
412,BOOK I.,"Minerva would have put him in bonds. It was you, goddess, who"
413,BOOK I.,delivered him by calling to Olympus the hundred-handed monster
414,BOOK I.,"whom gods call Briareus, but men Aegaeon, for he is stronger even"
415,BOOK I.,than his father; when therefore he took his seat all-glorious
416,BOOK I.,"beside the son of Saturn, the other gods were afraid, and did not"
417,BOOK I.,"bind him. Go, then, to him, remind him of all this, clasp his"
418,BOOK I.,"knees, and bid him give succour to the Trojans. Let the Achaeans"
419,BOOK I.,"be hemmed in at the sterns of their ships, and perish on the"
420,BOOK I.,"sea-shore, that they may reap what joy they may of their king,"
421,BOOK I.,and that Agamemnon may rue his blindness in offering insult to
422,BOOK I.,the foremost of the Achaeans.”
423,BOOK I.,
424,BOOK I.,"Thetis wept and answered, “My son, woe is me that I should have"
425,BOOK I.,borne or suckled you. Would indeed that you had lived your span
426,BOOK I.,"free from all sorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief;"
427,BOOK I.,"alas, that you should be at once short of life and long of sorrow"
428,BOOK I.,"above your peers: woe, therefore, was the hour in which I bore"
429,BOOK I.,"you; nevertheless I will go to the snowy heights of Olympus, and"
430,BOOK I.,"tell this tale to Jove, if he will hear our prayer: meanwhile"
431,BOOK I.,"stay where you are with your ships, nurse your anger against the"
432,BOOK I.,"Achaeans, and hold aloof from fight. For Jove went yesterday to"
433,BOOK I.,"Oceanus, to a feast among the Ethiopians, and the other gods went"
434,BOOK I.,with him. He will return to Olympus twelve days hence; I will
435,BOOK I.,then go to his mansion paved with bronze and will beseech him;
436,BOOK I.,nor do I doubt that I shall be able to persuade him.”
437,BOOK I.,
438,BOOK I.,"On this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had"
439,BOOK I.,been taken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached Chryse with the
440,BOOK I.,hecatomb. When they had come inside the harbour they furled the
441,BOOK I.,sails and laid them in the ship’s hold; they slackened the
442,BOOK I.,"forestays, lowered the mast into its place, and rowed the ship to"
443,BOOK I.,the place where they would have her lie; there they cast out
444,BOOK I.,their mooring-stones and made fast the hawsers. They then got out
445,BOOK I.,upon the sea-shore and landed the hecatomb for Apollo; Chryseis
446,BOOK I.,"also left the ship, and Ulysses led her to the altar to deliver"
447,BOOK I.,"her into the hands of her father. “Chryses,” said he, “King"
448,BOOK I.,"Agamemnon has sent me to bring you back your child, and to offer"
449,BOOK I.,"sacrifice to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, that we may"
450,BOOK I.,"propitiate the god, who has now brought sorrow upon the Argives.”"
451,BOOK I.,
452,BOOK I.,"So saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her"
453,BOOK I.,"gladly, and they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round the"
454,BOOK I.,altar of the god. They washed their hands and took up the
455,BOOK I.,"barley-meal to sprinkle over the victims, while Chryses lifted up"
456,BOOK I.,"his hands and prayed aloud on their behalf. “Hear me,” he cried,"
457,BOOK I.,"“O god of the silver bow, that protectest Chryse and holy Cilla,"
458,BOOK I.,and rulest Tenedos with thy might. Even as thou didst hear me
459,BOOK I.,"aforetime when I prayed, and didst press hardly upon the"
460,BOOK I.,"Achaeans, so hear me yet again, and stay this fearful pestilence"
461,BOOK I.,from the Danaans.”
462,BOOK I.,
463,BOOK I.,"Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done"
464,BOOK I.,"praying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads"
465,BOOK I.,of the victims and killed and flayed them. They cut out the
466,BOOK I.,"thigh-bones, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, set some"
467,BOOK I.,"pieces of raw meat on the top of them, and then Chryses laid them"
468,BOOK I.,"on the wood fire and poured wine over them, while the young men"
469,BOOK I.,stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands. When the
470,BOOK I.,"thigh-bones were burned and they had tasted the inward meats,"
471,BOOK I.,"they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon the spits,"
472,BOOK I.,"roasted them till they were done, and drew them off: then, when"
473,BOOK I.,"they had finished their work and the feast was ready, they ate"
474,BOOK I.,"it, and every man had his full share, so that all were satisfied."
475,BOOK I.,"As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink, pages filled the"
476,BOOK I.,"mixing-bowl with wine and water and handed it round, after giving"
477,BOOK I.,every man his drink-offering.
478,BOOK I.,
479,BOOK I.,"Thus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song,"
480,BOOK I.,"hymning him and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took"
481,BOOK I.,"pleasure in their voices; but when the sun went down, and it came"
482,BOOK I.,"on dark, they laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables"
483,BOOK I.,"of the ship, and when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,"
484,BOOK I.,appeared they again set sail for the host of the Achaeans. Apollo
485,BOOK I.,"sent them a fair wind, so they raised their mast and hoisted"
486,BOOK I.,their white sails aloft. As the sail bellied with the wind the
487,BOOK I.,"ship flew through the deep blue water, and the foam hissed"
488,BOOK I.,against her bows as she sped onward. When they reached the
489,BOOK I.,"wide-stretching host of the Achaeans, they drew the vessel"
490,BOOK I.,"ashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strong props beneath"
491,BOOK I.,"her, and went their ways to their own tents and ships."
492,BOOK I.,
493,BOOK I.,But Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not
494,BOOK I.,"to the honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but"
495,BOOK I.,"gnawed at his own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry."
496,BOOK I.,
497,BOOK I.,Now after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to
498,BOOK I.,"Olympus, and Jove led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of the"
499,BOOK I.,"charge her son had laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea"
500,BOOK I.,"and went through great heaven with early morning to Olympus,"
501,BOOK I.,where she found the mighty son of Saturn sitting all alone upon
502,BOOK I.,"its topmost ridges. She sat herself down before him, and with her"
503,BOOK I.,"left hand seized his knees, while with her right she caught him"
504,BOOK I.,"under the chin, and besought him, saying:—"
505,BOOK I.,
506,BOOK I.,"“Father Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the"
507,BOOK I.,"immortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is"
508,BOOK I.,to be cut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by
509,BOOK I.,"taking his prize and keeping her. Honour him then yourself,"
510,BOOK I.,"Olympian lord of counsel, and grant victory to the Trojans, till"
511,BOOK I.,the Achaeans give my son his due and load him with riches in
512,BOOK I.,requital.”
513,BOOK I.,
514,BOOK I.,"Jove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still"
515,BOOK I.,"kept firm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time."
516,BOOK I.,"“Incline your head,” said she, “and promise me surely, or else"
517,BOOK I.,deny me—for you have nothing to fear—that I may learn how greatly
518,BOOK I.,you disdain me.”
519,BOOK I.,
520,BOOK I.,"At this Jove was much troubled and answered, “I shall have"
521,BOOK I.,"trouble if you set me quarrelling with Juno, for she will provoke"
522,BOOK I.,me with her taunting speeches; even now she is always railing at
523,BOOK I.,me before the other gods and accusing me of giving aid to the
524,BOOK I.,"Trojans. Go back now, lest she should find out. I will consider"
525,BOOK I.,"the matter, and will bring it about as you wish. See, I incline"
526,BOOK I.,my head that you may believe me. This is the most solemn promise
527,BOOK I.,"that I can give to any god. I never recall my word, or deceive,"
528,BOOK I.,"or fail to do what I say, when I have nodded my head.”"
529,BOOK I.,
530,BOOK I.,"As he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and the"
531,BOOK I.,"ambrosial locks swayed on his immortal head, till vast Olympus"
532,BOOK I.,reeled.
533,BOOK I.,
534,BOOK I.,"When the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted—Jove to his"
535,BOOK I.,"house, while the goddess quitted the splendour of Olympus, and"
536,BOOK I.,plunged into the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their
537,BOOK I.,"seats, before the coming of their sire. Not one of them dared to"
538,BOOK I.,"remain sitting, but all stood up as he came among them. There,"
539,BOOK I.,"then, he took his seat. But Juno, when she saw him, knew that he"
540,BOOK I.,"and the old merman’s daughter, silver-footed Thetis, had been"
541,BOOK I.,"hatching mischief, so she at once began to upbraid him."
542,BOOK I.,"“Trickster,” she cried, “which of the gods have you been taking"
543,BOOK I.,into your counsels now? You are always settling matters in secret
544,BOOK I.,"behind my back, and have never yet told me, if you could help it,"
545,BOOK I.,one word of your intentions.”
546,BOOK I.,
547,BOOK I.,"“Juno,” replied the sire of gods and men, “you must not expect to"
548,BOOK I.,"be informed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would"
549,BOOK I.,find it hard to understand them. When it is proper for you to
550,BOOK I.,"hear, there is no one, god or man, who will be told sooner, but"
551,BOOK I.,"when I mean to keep a matter to myself, you must not pry nor ask"
552,BOOK I.,questions.”
553,BOOK I.,
554,BOOK I.,"“Dread son of Saturn,” answered Juno, “what are you talking"
555,BOOK I.,about? I? Pry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own
556,BOOK I.,"way in everything. Still, I have a strong misgiving that the old"
557,BOOK I.,"merman’s daughter Thetis has been talking you over, for she was"
558,BOOK I.,with you and had hold of your knees this self-same morning. I
559,BOOK I.,"believe, therefore, that you have been promising her to give"
560,BOOK I.,"glory to Achilles, and to kill much people at the ships of the"
561,BOOK I.,Achaeans.”
562,BOOK I.,
563,BOOK I.,"“Wife,” said Jove, “I can do nothing but you suspect me and find"
564,BOOK I.,"it out. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike you"
565,BOOK I.,"the more, and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as"
566,BOOK I.,you say; I mean to have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as I
567,BOOK I.,"bid you for if I once begin to lay my hands about you, though all"
568,BOOK I.,heaven were on your side it would profit you nothing.”
569,BOOK I.,
570,BOOK I.,"On this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and"
571,BOOK I.,sat down in silence. But the heavenly beings were disquieted
572,BOOK I.,"throughout the house of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan"
573,BOOK I.,began to try and pacify his mother Juno. “It will be
574,BOOK I.,"intolerable,” said he, “if you two fall to wrangling and setting"
575,BOOK I.,heaven in an uproar about a pack of mortals. If such ill counsels
576,BOOK I.,"are to prevail, we shall have no pleasure at our banquet. Let me"
577,BOOK I.,then advise my mother—and she must herself know that it will be
578,BOOK I.,"better—to make friends with my dear father Jove, lest he again"
579,BOOK I.,scold her and disturb our feast. If the Olympian Thunderer wants
580,BOOK I.,"to hurl us all from our seats, he can do so, for he is far the"
581,BOOK I.,"strongest, so give him fair words, and he will then soon be in a"
582,BOOK I.,good humour with us.”
583,BOOK I.,
584,BOOK I.,"As he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in his"
585,BOOK I.,"mother’s hand. “Cheer up, my dear mother,” said he, “and make the"
586,BOOK I.,"best of it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see"
587,BOOK I.,"you get a thrashing; however grieved I might be, I could not"
588,BOOK I.,"help, for there is no standing against Jove. Once before when I"
589,BOOK I.,"was trying to help you, he caught me by the foot and flung me"
590,BOOK I.,"from the heavenly threshold. All day long from morn till eve, was"
591,BOOK I.,"I falling, till at sunset I came to ground in the island of"
592,BOOK I.,"Lemnos, and there I lay, with very little life left in me, till"
593,BOOK I.,the Sintians came and tended me.”
594,BOOK I.,
595,BOOK I.,"Juno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her"
596,BOOK I.,"son’s hands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl,"
597,BOOK I.,"and served it round among the gods, going from left to right; and"
598,BOOK I.,the blessed gods laughed out a loud applause as they saw him
599,BOOK I.,bustling about the heavenly mansion.
600,BOOK I.,
601,BOOK I.,Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they
602,BOOK I.,"feasted, and every one had his full share, so that all were"
603,BOOK I.,"satisfied. Apollo struck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their"
604,BOOK I.,"sweet voices, calling and answering one another. But when the"
605,BOOK I.,"sun’s glorious light had faded, they went home to bed, each in"
606,BOOK I.,"his own abode, which lame Vulcan with his consummate skill had"
607,BOOK I.,"fashioned for them. So Jove, the Olympian Lord of Thunder, hied"
608,BOOK I.,him to the bed in which he always slept; and when he had got on
609,BOOK I.,"to it he went to sleep, with Juno of the golden throne by his"
610,BOOK I.,side.

618,BOOK II.,"Jove sends a lying dream to Agamemnon, who thereon calls the"
619,BOOK II.,"chiefs in assembly, and proposes to sound the mind of his army—In"
620,BOOK II.,the end they march to fight—Catalogue of the Achaean and Trojan
621,BOOK II.,forces.
622,BOOK II.,
623,BOOK II.,Now the other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slept
624,BOOK II.,"soundly, but Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do"
625,BOOK II.,"honour to Achilles, and destroyed much people at the ships of the"
626,BOOK II.,Achaeans. In the end he deemed it would be best to send a lying
627,BOOK II.,"dream to King Agamemnon; so he called one to him and said to it,"
628,BOOK II.,"“Lying Dream, go to the ships of the Achaeans, into the tent of"
629,BOOK II.,"Agamemnon, and say to him word for word as I now bid you. Tell"
630,BOOK II.,"him to get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for he shall take"
631,BOOK II.,Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno
632,BOOK II.,"has brought them to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans.”"
633,BOOK II.,
634,BOOK II.,"The dream went when it had heard its message, and soon reached"
635,BOOK II.,the ships of the Achaeans. It sought Agamemnon son of Atreus and
636,BOOK II.,"found him in his tent, wrapped in a profound slumber. It hovered"
637,BOOK II.,"over his head in the likeness of Nestor, son of Neleus, whom"
638,BOOK II.,"Agamemnon honoured above all his councillors, and said:—"
639,BOOK II.,
640,BOOK II.,"“You are sleeping, son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his"
641,BOOK II.,host and so much other care upon his shoulders should dock his
642,BOOK II.,"sleep. Hear me at once, for I come as a messenger from Jove, who,"
643,BOOK II.,"though he be not near, yet takes thought for you and pities you."
644,BOOK II.,"He bids you get the Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall"
645,BOOK II.,take Troy. There are no longer divided counsels among the gods;
646,BOOK II.,"Juno has brought them over to her own mind, and woe betides the"
647,BOOK II.,"Trojans at the hands of Jove. Remember this, and when you wake"
648,BOOK II.,see that it does not escape you.”
649,BOOK II.,
650,BOOK II.,"The dream then left him, and he thought of things that were"
651,BOOK II.,surely not to be accomplished. He thought that on that same day
652,BOOK II.,"he was to take the city of Priam, but he little knew what was in"
653,BOOK II.,"the mind of Jove, who had many another hard-fought fight in store"
654,BOOK II.,"alike for Danaans and Trojans. Then presently he woke, with the"
655,BOOK II.,"divine message still ringing in his ears; so he sat upright, and"
656,BOOK II.,"put on his soft shirt so fair and new, and over this his heavy"
657,BOOK II.,"cloak. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet, and slung his"
658,BOOK II.,silver-studded sword about his shoulders; then he took the
659,BOOK II.,"imperishable staff of his father, and sallied forth to the ships"
660,BOOK II.,of the Achaeans.
661,BOOK II.,
662,BOOK II.,The goddess Dawn now wended her way to vast Olympus that she
663,BOOK II.,"might herald day to Jove and to the other immortals, and"
664,BOOK II.,Agamemnon sent the criers round to call the people in assembly;
665,BOOK II.,so they called them and the people gathered thereon. But first he
666,BOOK II.,summoned a meeting of the elders at the ship of Nestor king of
667,BOOK II.,"Pylos, and when they were assembled he laid a cunning counsel"
668,BOOK II.,before them.
669,BOOK II.,
670,BOOK II.,"“My friends,” said he, “I have had a dream from heaven in the"
671,BOOK II.,"dead of night, and its face and figure resembled none but"
672,BOOK II.,"Nestor’s. It hovered over my head and said, ‘You are sleeping,"
673,BOOK II.,son of Atreus; one who has the welfare of his host and so much
674,BOOK II.,other care upon his shoulders should dock his sleep. Hear me at
675,BOOK II.,"once, for I am a messenger from Jove, who, though he be not near,"
676,BOOK II.,yet takes thought for you and pities you. He bids you get the
677,BOOK II.,"Achaeans instantly under arms, for you shall take Troy. There are"
678,BOOK II.,no longer divided counsels among the gods; Juno has brought them
679,BOOK II.,"over to her own mind, and woe betides the Trojans at the hands of"
680,BOOK II.,Jove. Remember this.’ The dream then vanished and I awoke. Let us
681,BOOK II.,"now, therefore, arm the sons of the Achaeans. But it will be well"
682,BOOK II.,"that I should first sound them, and to this end I will tell them"
683,BOOK II.,to fly with their ships; but do you others go about among the
684,BOOK II.,host and prevent their doing so.”
685,BOOK II.,
686,BOOK II.,"He then sat down, and Nestor the prince of Pylos with all"
687,BOOK II.,"sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: “My friends,” said"
688,BOOK II.,"he, “princes and councillors of the Argives, if any other man of"
689,BOOK II.,the Achaeans had told us of this dream we should have declared it
690,BOOK II.,"false, and would have had nothing to do with it. But he who has"
691,BOOK II.,seen it is the foremost man among us; we must therefore set about
692,BOOK II.,getting the people under arms.”
693,BOOK II.,
694,BOOK II.,"With this he led the way from the assembly, and the other"
695,BOOK II.,sceptred kings rose with him in obedience to the word of
696,BOOK II.,Agamemnon; but the people pressed forward to hear. They swarmed
697,BOOK II.,like bees that sally from some hollow cave and flit in countless
698,BOOK II.,"throng among the spring flowers, bunched in knots and clusters;"
699,BOOK II.,even so did the mighty multitude pour from ships and tents to the
700,BOOK II.,"assembly, and range themselves upon the wide-watered shore, while"
701,BOOK II.,"among them ran Wildfire Rumour, messenger of Jove, urging them"
702,BOOK II.,ever to the fore. Thus they gathered in a pell-mell of mad
703,BOOK II.,"confusion, and the earth groaned under the tramp of men as the"
704,BOOK II.,people sought their places. Nine heralds went crying about among
705,BOOK II.,"them to stay their tumult and bid them listen to the kings, till"
706,BOOK II.,at last they were got into their several places and ceased their
707,BOOK II.,"clamour. Then King Agamemnon rose, holding his sceptre. This was"
708,BOOK II.,"the work of Vulcan, who gave it to Jove the son of Saturn. Jove"
709,BOOK II.,"gave it to Mercury, slayer of Argus, guide and guardian. King"
710,BOOK II.,"Mercury gave it to Pelops, the mighty charioteer, and Pelops to"
711,BOOK II.,"Atreus, shepherd of his people. Atreus, when he died, left it to"
712,BOOK II.,"Thyestes, rich in flocks, and Thyestes in his turn left it to be"
713,BOOK II.,"borne by Agamemnon, that he might be lord of all Argos and of the"
714,BOOK II.,"isles. Leaning, then, on his sceptre, he addressed the Argives."
715,BOOK II.,
716,BOOK II.,"“My friends,” he said, “heroes, servants of Mars, the hand of"
717,BOOK II.,heaven has been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his
718,BOOK II.,solemn promise that I should sack the city of Priam before
719,BOOK II.,"returning, but he has played me false, and is now bidding me go"
720,BOOK II.,ingloriously back to Argos with the loss of much people. Such is
721,BOOK II.,"the will of Jove, who has laid many a proud city in the dust, as"
722,BOOK II.,"he will yet lay others, for his power is above all. It will be a"
723,BOOK II.,"sorry tale hereafter that an Achaean host, at once so great and"
724,BOOK II.,"valiant, battled in vain against men fewer in number than"
725,BOOK II.,themselves; but as yet the end is not in sight. Think that the
726,BOOK II.,"Achaeans and Trojans have sworn to a solemn covenant, and that"
727,BOOK II.,they have each been numbered—the Trojans by the roll of their
728,BOOK II.,"householders, and we by companies of ten; think further that each"
729,BOOK II.,of our companies desired to have a Trojan householder to pour out
730,BOOK II.,their wine; we are so greatly more in number that full many a
731,BOOK II.,company would have to go without its cup-bearer. But they have in
732,BOOK II.,"the town allies from other places, and it is these that hinder me"
733,BOOK II.,from being able to sack the rich city of Ilius. Nine of Jove’s
734,BOOK II.,years are gone; the timbers of our ships have rotted; their
735,BOOK II.,tackling is sound no longer. Our wives and little ones at home
736,BOOK II.,"look anxiously for our coming, but the work that we came hither"
737,BOOK II.,"to do has not been done. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say:"
738,BOOK II.,"let us sail back to our own land, for we shall not take Troy.”"
739,BOOK II.,
740,BOOK II.,"With these words he moved the hearts of the multitude, so many of"
741,BOOK II.,them as knew not the cunning counsel of Agamemnon. They surged to
742,BOOK II.,"and fro like the waves of the Icarian Sea, when the east and"
743,BOOK II.,south winds break from heaven’s clouds to lash them; or as when
744,BOOK II.,the west wind sweeps over a field of corn and the ears bow
745,BOOK II.,"beneath the blast, even so were they swayed as they flew with"
746,BOOK II.,"loud cries towards the ships, and the dust from under their feet"
747,BOOK II.,rose heavenward. They cheered each other on to draw the ships
748,BOOK II.,into the sea; they cleared the channels in front of them; they
749,BOOK II.,"began taking away the stays from underneath them, and the welkin"
750,BOOK II.,"rang with their glad cries, so eager were they to return."
751,BOOK II.,
752,BOOK II.,Then surely the Argives would have returned after a fashion that
753,BOOK II.,"was not fated. But Juno said to Minerva, “Alas, daughter of"
754,BOOK II.,"aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to"
755,BOOK II.,"their own land over the broad sea, and leave Priam and the"
756,BOOK II.,"Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many"
757,BOOK II.,"of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Go about"
758,BOOK II.,"at once among the host, and speak fairly to them, man by man,"
759,BOOK II.,that they draw not their ships into the sea.”
760,BOOK II.,
761,BOOK II.,Minerva was not slack to do her bidding. Down she darted from the
762,BOOK II.,"topmost summits of Olympus, and in a moment she was at the ships"
763,BOOK II.,"of the Achaeans. There she found Ulysses, peer of Jove in"
764,BOOK II.,"counsel, standing alone. He had not as yet laid a hand upon his"
765,BOOK II.,"ship, for he was grieved and sorry; so she went close up to him"
766,BOOK II.,"and said, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, are you going to fling"
767,BOOK II.,yourselves into your ships and be off home to your own land in
768,BOOK II.,this way? Will you leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still
769,BOOK II.,"keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died"
770,BOOK II.,"at Troy, far from their homes? Go about at once among the host,"
771,BOOK II.,"and speak fairly to them, man by man, that they draw not their"
772,BOOK II.,ships into the sea.”
773,BOOK II.,
774,BOOK II.,Ulysses knew the voice as that of the goddess: he flung his cloak
775,BOOK II.,"from him and set off to run. His servant Eurybates, a man of"
776,BOOK II.,"Ithaca, who waited on him, took charge of the cloak, whereon"
777,BOOK II.,Ulysses went straight up to Agamemnon and received from him his
778,BOOK II.,"ancestral, imperishable staff. With this he went about among the"
779,BOOK II.,ships of the Achaeans.
780,BOOK II.,
781,BOOK II.,"Whenever he met a king or chieftain, he stood by him and spoke"
782,BOOK II.,"him fairly. “Sir,” said he, “this flight is cowardly and"
783,BOOK II.,"unworthy. Stand to your post, and bid your people also keep their"
784,BOOK II.,places. You do not yet know the full mind of Agamemnon; he was
785,BOOK II.,"sounding us, and ere long will visit the Achaeans with his"
786,BOOK II.,displeasure. We were not all of us at the council to hear what he
787,BOOK II.,then said; see to it lest he be angry and do us a mischief; for
788,BOOK II.,"the pride of kings is great, and the hand of Jove is with them.”"
789,BOOK II.,
790,BOOK II.,"But when he came across any common man who was making a noise, he"
791,BOOK II.,"struck him with his staff and rebuked him, saying, “Sirrah, hold"
792,BOOK II.,"your peace, and listen to better men than yourself. You are a"
793,BOOK II.,coward and no soldier; you are nobody either in fight or council;
794,BOOK II.,we cannot all be kings; it is not well that there should be many
795,BOOK II.,masters; one man must be supreme—one king to whom the son of
796,BOOK II.,scheming Saturn has given the sceptre of sovereignty over you
797,BOOK II.,all.”
798,BOOK II.,
799,BOOK II.,"Thus masterfully did he go about among the host, and the people"
800,BOOK II.,hurried back to the council from their tents and ships with a
801,BOOK II.,sound as the thunder of surf when it comes crashing down upon the
802,BOOK II.,"shore, and all the sea is in an uproar."
803,BOOK II.,
804,BOOK II.,The rest now took their seats and kept to their own several
805,BOOK II.,"places, but Thersites still went on wagging his unbridled"
806,BOOK II.,"tongue—a man of many words, and those unseemly; a monger of"
807,BOOK II.,"sedition, a railer against all who were in authority, who cared"
808,BOOK II.,"not what he said, so that he might set the Achaeans in a laugh."
809,BOOK II.,He was the ugliest man of all those that came before
810,BOOK II.,"Troy—bandy-legged, lame of one foot, with his two shoulders"
811,BOOK II.,"rounded and hunched over his chest. His head ran up to a point,"
812,BOOK II.,but there was little hair on the top of it. Achilles and Ulysses
813,BOOK II.,"hated him worst of all, for it was with them that he was most"
814,BOOK II.,"wont to wrangle; now, however, with a shrill squeaky voice he"
815,BOOK II.,began heaping his abuse on Agamemnon. The Achaeans were angry and
816,BOOK II.,"disgusted, yet none the less he kept on brawling and bawling at"
817,BOOK II.,the son of Atreus.
818,BOOK II.,
819,BOOK II.,"“Agamemnon,” he cried, “what ails you now, and what more do you"
820,BOOK II.,"want? Your tents are filled with bronze and with fair women, for"
821,BOOK II.,whenever we take a town we give you the pick of them. Would you
822,BOOK II.,"have yet more gold, which some Trojan is to give you as a ransom"
823,BOOK II.,"for his son, when I or another Achaean has taken him prisoner? or"
824,BOOK II.,is it some young girl to hide and lie with? It is not well that
825,BOOK II.,"you, the ruler of the Achaeans, should bring them into such"
826,BOOK II.,"misery. Weakling cowards, women rather than men, let us sail"
827,BOOK II.,"home, and leave this fellow here at Troy to stew in his own meeds"
828,BOOK II.,"of honour, and discover whether we were of any service to him or"
829,BOOK II.,"no. Achilles is a much better man than he is, and see how he has"
830,BOOK II.,treated him—robbing him of his prize and keeping it himself.
831,BOOK II.,"Achilles takes it meekly and shows no fight; if he did, son of"
832,BOOK II.,"Atreus, you would never again insult him.”"
833,BOOK II.,
834,BOOK II.,"Thus railed Thersites, but Ulysses at once went up to him and"
835,BOOK II.,"rebuked him sternly. “Check your glib tongue, Thersites,” said"
836,BOOK II.,"he, “and babble not a word further. Chide not with princes when"
837,BOOK II.,you have none to back you. There is no viler creature come before
838,BOOK II.,"Troy with the sons of Atreus. Drop this chatter about kings, and"
839,BOOK II.,neither revile them nor keep harping about going home. We do not
840,BOOK II.,"yet know how things are going to be, nor whether the Achaeans are"
841,BOOK II.,to return with good success or evil. How dare you gibe at
842,BOOK II.,Agamemnon because the Danaans have awarded him so many prizes? I
843,BOOK II.,"tell you, therefore—and it shall surely be—that if I again catch"
844,BOOK II.,"you talking such nonsense, I will either forfeit my own head and"
845,BOOK II.,"be no more called father of Telemachus, or I will take you, strip"
846,BOOK II.,"you stark naked, and whip you out of the assembly till you go"
847,BOOK II.,blubbering back to the ships.”
848,BOOK II.,
849,BOOK II.,On this he beat him with his staff about the back and shoulders
850,BOOK II.,till he dropped and fell a-weeping. The golden sceptre raised a
851,BOOK II.,"bloody weal on his back, so he sat down frightened and in pain,"
852,BOOK II.,looking foolish as he wiped the tears from his eyes. The people
853,BOOK II.,"were sorry for him, yet they laughed heartily, and one would turn"
854,BOOK II.,"to his neighbour saying, “Ulysses has done many a good thing ere"
855,BOOK II.,"now in fight and council, but he never did the Argives a better"
856,BOOK II.,turn than when he stopped this fellow’s mouth from prating
857,BOOK II.,further. He will give the kings no more of his insolence.”
858,BOOK II.,
859,BOOK II.,"Thus said the people. Then Ulysses rose, sceptre in hand, and"
860,BOOK II.,"Minerva in the likeness of a herald bade the people be still,"
861,BOOK II.,that those who were far off might hear him and consider his
862,BOOK II.,council. He therefore with all sincerity and goodwill addressed
863,BOOK II.,them thus:—
864,BOOK II.,
865,BOOK II.,"“King Agamemnon, the Achaeans are for making you a by-word among"
866,BOOK II.,all mankind. They forget the promise they made you when they set
867,BOOK II.,"out from Argos, that you should not return till you had sacked"
868,BOOK II.,"the town of Troy, and, like children or widowed women, they"
869,BOOK II.,murmur and would set off homeward. True it is that they have had
870,BOOK II.,toil enough to be disheartened. A man chafes at having to stay
871,BOOK II.,"away from his wife even for a single month, when he is on"
872,BOOK II.,"shipboard, at the mercy of wind and sea, but it is now nine long"
873,BOOK II.,"years that we have been kept here; I cannot, therefore, blame the"
874,BOOK II.,Achaeans if they turn restive; still we shall be shamed if we go
875,BOOK II.,"home empty after so long a stay—therefore, my friends, be patient"
876,BOOK II.,yet a little longer that we may learn whether the prophesyings of
877,BOOK II.,Calchas were false or true.
878,BOOK II.,
879,BOOK II.,“All who have not since perished must remember as though it were
880,BOOK II.,"yesterday or the day before, how the ships of the Achaeans were"
881,BOOK II.,detained in Aulis when we were on our way hither to make war on
882,BOOK II.,Priam and the Trojans. We were ranged round about a fountain
883,BOOK II.,"offering hecatombs to the gods upon their holy altars, and there"
884,BOOK II.,was a fine plane-tree from beneath which there welled a stream of
885,BOOK II.,pure water. Then we saw a prodigy; for Jove sent a fearful
886,BOOK II.,"serpent out of the ground, with blood-red stains upon its back,"
887,BOOK II.,and it darted from under the altar on to the plane-tree. Now
888,BOOK II.,"there was a brood of young sparrows, quite small, upon the"
889,BOOK II.,"topmost bough, peeping out from under the leaves, eight in all,"
890,BOOK II.,and their mother that hatched them made nine. The serpent ate the
891,BOOK II.,"poor cheeping things, while the old bird flew about lamenting her"
892,BOOK II.,little ones; but the serpent threw his coils about her and caught
893,BOOK II.,"her by the wing as she was screaming. Then, when he had eaten"
894,BOOK II.,"both the sparrow and her young, the god who had sent him made him"
895,BOOK II.,become a sign; for the son of scheming Saturn turned him into
896,BOOK II.,"stone, and we stood there wondering at that which had come to"
897,BOOK II.,"pass. Seeing, then, that such a fearful portent had broken in"
898,BOOK II.,"upon our hecatombs, Calchas forthwith declared to us the oracles"
899,BOOK II.,"of heaven. ‘Why, Achaeans,’ said he, ‘are you thus speechless?"
900,BOOK II.,"Jove has sent us this sign, long in coming, and long ere it be"
901,BOOK II.,"fulfilled, though its fame shall last for ever. As the serpent"
902,BOOK II.,"ate the eight fledglings and the sparrow that hatched them, which"
903,BOOK II.,"makes nine, so shall we fight nine years at Troy, but in the"
904,BOOK II.,"tenth shall take the town.’ This was what he said, and now it is"
905,BOOK II.,"all coming true. Stay here, therefore, all of you, till we take"
906,BOOK II.,the city of Priam.”
907,BOOK II.,
908,BOOK II.,"On this the Argives raised a shout, till the ships rang again"
909,BOOK II.,"with the uproar. Nestor, knight of Gerene, then addressed them."
910,BOOK II.,"“Shame on you,” he cried, “to stay talking here like children,"
911,BOOK II.,"when you should fight like men. Where are our covenants now, and"
912,BOOK II.,where the oaths that we have taken? Shall our counsels be flung
913,BOOK II.,"into the fire, with our drink-offerings and the right hands of"
914,BOOK II.,fellowship wherein we have put our trust? We waste our time in
915,BOOK II.,"words, and for all our talking here shall be no further forward."
916,BOOK II.,"Stand, therefore, son of Atreus, by your own steadfast purpose;"
917,BOOK II.,"lead the Argives on to battle, and leave this handful of men to"
918,BOOK II.,"rot, who scheme, and scheme in vain, to get back to Argos ere"
919,BOOK II.,they have learned whether Jove be true or a liar. For the mighty
920,BOOK II.,"son of Saturn surely promised that we should succeed, when we"
921,BOOK II.,Argives set sail to bring death and destruction upon the Trojans.
922,BOOK II.,He showed us favourable signs by flashing his lightning on our
923,BOOK II.,right hands; therefore let none make haste to go till he has
924,BOOK II.,"first lain with the wife of some Trojan, and avenged the toil and"
925,BOOK II.,"sorrow that he has suffered for the sake of Helen. Nevertheless,"
926,BOOK II.,"if any man is in such haste to be at home again, let him lay his"
927,BOOK II.,hand to his ship that he may meet his doom in the sight of all.
928,BOOK II.,"But, O king, consider and give ear to my counsel, for the word"
929,BOOK II.,"that I say may not be neglected lightly. Divide your men,"
930,BOOK II.,"Agamemnon, into their several tribes and clans, that clans and"
931,BOOK II.,"tribes may stand by and help one another. If you do this, and if"
932,BOOK II.,"the Achaeans obey you, you will find out who, both chiefs and"
933,BOOK II.,"peoples, are brave, and who are cowards; for they will vie"
934,BOOK II.,against the other. Thus you shall also learn whether it is
935,BOOK II.,through the counsel of heaven or the cowardice of man that you
936,BOOK II.,shall fail to take the town.”
937,BOOK II.,
938,BOOK II.,"And Agamemnon answered, “Nestor, you have again outdone the sons"
939,BOOK II.,"of the Achaeans in counsel. Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and"
940,BOOK II.,"Apollo, that I had among them ten more such councillors, for the"
941,BOOK II.,"city of King Priam would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we"
942,BOOK II.,should sack it. But the son of Saturn afflicts me with bootless
943,BOOK II.,wranglings and strife. Achilles and I are quarrelling about this
944,BOOK II.,"girl, in which matter I was the first to offend; if we can be of"
945,BOOK II.,"one mind again, the Trojans will not stave off destruction for a"
946,BOOK II.,"day. Now, therefore, get your morning meal, that our hosts join"
947,BOOK II.,in fight. Whet well your spears; see well to the ordering of your
948,BOOK II.,"shields; give good feeds to your horses, and look your chariots"
949,BOOK II.,"carefully over, that we may do battle the livelong day; for we"
950,BOOK II.,"shall have no rest, not for a moment, till night falls to part"
951,BOOK II.,us. The bands that bear your shields shall be wet with the sweat
952,BOOK II.,"upon your shoulders, your hands shall weary upon your spears,"
953,BOOK II.,"your horses shall steam in front of your chariots, and if I see"
954,BOOK II.,"any man shirking the fight, or trying to keep out of it at the"
955,BOOK II.,"ships, there shall be no help for him, but he shall be a prey to"
956,BOOK II.,dogs and vultures.”
957,BOOK II.,
958,BOOK II.,"Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans roared applause. As when the"
959,BOOK II.,waves run high before the blast of the south wind and break on
960,BOOK II.,"some lofty headland, dashing against it and buffeting it without"
961,BOOK II.,"ceasing, as the storms from every quarter drive them, even so did"
962,BOOK II.,the Achaeans rise and hurry in all directions to their ships.
963,BOOK II.,"There they lighted their fires at their tents and got dinner,"
964,BOOK II.,"offering sacrifice every man to one or other of the gods, and"
965,BOOK II.,praying each one of them that he might live to come out of the
966,BOOK II.,"fight. Agamemnon, king of men, sacrificed a fat five-year-old"
967,BOOK II.,"bull to the mighty son of Saturn, and invited the princes and"
968,BOOK II.,"elders of his host. First he asked Nestor and King Idomeneus,"
969,BOOK II.,"then the two Ajaxes and the son of Tydeus, and sixthly Ulysses,"
970,BOOK II.,"peer of gods in counsel; but Menelaus came of his own accord, for"
971,BOOK II.,he knew how busy his brother then was. They stood round the bull
972,BOOK II.,"with the barley-meal in their hands, and Agamemnon prayed,"
973,BOOK II.,"saying, “Jove, most glorious, supreme, that dwellest in heaven,"
974,BOOK II.,"and ridest upon the storm-cloud, grant that the sun may not go"
975,BOOK II.,"down, nor the night fall, till the palace of Priam is laid low,"
976,BOOK II.,and its gates are consumed with fire. Grant that my sword may
977,BOOK II.,"pierce the shirt of Hector about his heart, and that full many of"
978,BOOK II.,his comrades may bite the dust as they fall dying round him.”
979,BOOK II.,
980,BOOK II.,"Thus he prayed, but the son of Saturn would not fulfil his"
981,BOOK II.,"prayer. He accepted the sacrifice, yet none the less increased"
982,BOOK II.,their toil continually. When they had done praying and sprinkling
983,BOOK II.,"the barley-meal upon the victim, they drew back its head, killed"
984,BOOK II.,"it, and then flayed it. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped"
985,BOOK II.,"them round in two layers of fat, and set pieces of raw meat on"
986,BOOK II.,the top of them. These they burned upon the split logs of
987,BOOK II.,"firewood, but they spitted the inward meats, and held them in the"
988,BOOK II.,"flames to cook. When the thigh-bones were burned, and they had"
989,BOOK II.,"tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small, put the"
990,BOOK II.,"pieces upon spits, roasted them till they were done, and drew"
991,BOOK II.,"them off; then, when they had finished their work and the feast"
992,BOOK II.,"was ready, they ate it, and every man had his full share, so that"
993,BOOK II.,all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and
994,BOOK II.,"drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began to speak. “King"
995,BOOK II.,"Agamemnon,” said he, “let us not stay talking here, nor be slack"
996,BOOK II.,in the work that heaven has put into our hands. Let the heralds
997,BOOK II.,summon the people to gather at their several ships; we will then
998,BOOK II.,"go about among the host, that we may begin fighting at once.”"
999,BOOK II.,
1000,BOOK II.,"Thus did he speak, and Agamemnon heeded his words. He at once"
1001,BOOK II.,sent the criers round to call the people in assembly. So they
1002,BOOK II.,"called them, and the people gathered thereon. The chiefs about"
1003,BOOK II.,"the son of Atreus chose their men and marshalled them, while"
1004,BOOK II.,Minerva went among them holding her priceless aegis that knows
1005,BOOK II.,neither age nor death. From it there waved a hundred tassels of
1006,BOOK II.,"pure gold, all deftly woven, and each one of them worth a hundred"
1007,BOOK II.,oxen. With this she darted furiously everywhere among the hosts
1008,BOOK II.,"of the Achaeans, urging them forward, and putting courage into"
1009,BOOK II.,"the heart of each, so that he might fight and do battle without"
1010,BOOK II.,ceasing. Thus war became sweeter in their eyes even than
1011,BOOK II.,returning home in their ships. As when some great forest fire is
1012,BOOK II.,"raging upon a mountain top and its light is seen afar, even so as"
1013,BOOK II.,they marched the gleam of their armour flashed up into the
1014,BOOK II.,firmament of heaven.
1015,BOOK II.,
1016,BOOK II.,"They were like great flocks of geese, or cranes, or swans on the"
1017,BOOK II.,"plain about the waters of Cayster, that wing their way hither and"
1018,BOOK II.,"thither, glorying in the pride of flight, and crying as they"
1019,BOOK II.,settle till the fen is alive with their screaming. Even thus did
1020,BOOK II.,their tribes pour from ships and tents on to the plain of the
1021,BOOK II.,"Scamander, and the ground rang as brass under the feet of men and"
1022,BOOK II.,horses. They stood as thick upon the flower-bespangled field as
1023,BOOK II.,leaves that bloom in summer.
1024,BOOK II.,
1025,BOOK II.,As countless swarms of flies buzz around a herdsman’s homestead
1026,BOOK II.,"in the time of spring when the pails are drenched with milk, even"
1027,BOOK II.,so did the Achaeans swarm on to the plain to charge the Trojans
1028,BOOK II.,and destroy them.
1029,BOOK II.,
1030,BOOK II.,The chiefs disposed their men this way and that before the fight
1031,BOOK II.,"began, drafting them out as easily as goatherds draft their"
1032,BOOK II.,flocks when they have got mixed while feeding; and among them
1033,BOOK II.,"went King Agamemnon, with a head and face like Jove the lord of"
1034,BOOK II.,"thunder, a waist like Mars, and a chest like that of Neptune. As"
1035,BOOK II.,"some great bull that lords it over the herds upon the plain, even"
1036,BOOK II.,so did Jove make the son of Atreus stand peerless among the
1037,BOOK II.,multitude of heroes.
1038,BOOK II.,
1039,BOOK II.,"And now, O Muses, dwellers in the mansions of Olympus, tell"
1040,BOOK II.,me—for you are goddesses and are in all places so that you see
1041,BOOK II.,"all things, while we know nothing but by report—who were the"
1042,BOOK II.,"chiefs and princes of the Danaans? As for the common soldiers,"
1043,BOOK II.,they were so that I could not name every single one of them
1044,BOOK II.,"though I had ten tongues, and though my voice failed not and my"
1045,BOOK II.,"heart were of bronze within me, unless you, O Olympian Muses,"
1046,BOOK II.,"daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, were to recount them to me."
1047,BOOK II.,"Nevertheless, I will tell the captains of the ships and all the"
1048,BOOK II.,fleet together.
1049,BOOK II.,
1050,BOOK II.,"Peneleos, Leitus, Arcesilaus, Prothoenor, and Clonius were"
1051,BOOK II.,captains of the Boeotians. These were they that dwelt in Hyria
1052,BOOK II.,"and rocky Aulis, and who held Schoenus, Scolus, and the highlands"
1053,BOOK II.,"of Eteonus, with Thespeia, Graia, and the fair city of"
1054,BOOK II.,"Mycalessus. They also held Harma, Eilesium, and Erythrae; and"
1055,BOOK II.,"they had Eleon, Hyle, and Peteon; Ocalea and the strong fortress"
1056,BOOK II.,"of Medeon; Copae, Eutresis, and Thisbe the haunt of doves;"
1057,BOOK II.,"Coronea, and the pastures of Haliartus; Plataea and Glisas; the"
1058,BOOK II.,fortress of Thebes the less; holy Onchestus with its famous grove
1059,BOOK II.,"of Neptune; Arne rich in vineyards; Midea, sacred Nisa, and"
1060,BOOK II.,"Anthedon upon the sea. From these there came fifty ships, and in"
1061,BOOK II.,each there were a hundred and twenty young men of the Boeotians.
1062,BOOK II.,
1063,BOOK II.,"Ascalaphus and Ialmenus, sons of Mars, led the people that dwelt"
1064,BOOK II.,in Aspledon and Orchomenus the realm of Minyas. Astyoche a noble
1065,BOOK II.,maiden bore them in the house of Actor son of Azeus; for she had
1066,BOOK II.,"gone with Mars secretly into an upper chamber, and he had lain"
1067,BOOK II.,with her. With these there came thirty ships.
1068,BOOK II.,
1069,BOOK II.,"The Phoceans were led by Schedius and Epistrophus, sons of mighty"
1070,BOOK II.,Iphitus the son of Naubolus. These were they that held
1071,BOOK II.,"Cyparissus, rocky Pytho, holy Crisa, Daulis, and Panopeus; they"
1072,BOOK II.,"also that dwelt in Anemorea and Hyampolis, and about the waters"
1073,BOOK II.,"of the river Cephissus, and Lilaea by the springs of the"
1074,BOOK II.,"Cephissus; with their chieftains came forty ships, and they"
1075,BOOK II.,"marshalled the forces of the Phoceans, which were stationed next"
1076,BOOK II.,"to the Boeotians, on their left."
1077,BOOK II.,
1078,BOOK II.,"Ajax, the fleet son of Oileus, commanded the Locrians. He was not"
1079,BOOK II.,"so great, nor nearly so great, as Ajax the son of Telamon. He was"
1080,BOOK II.,"a little man, and his breastplate was made of linen, but in use"
1081,BOOK II.,of the spear he excelled all the Hellenes and the Achaeans. These
1082,BOOK II.,"dwelt in Cynus, Opous, Calliarus, Bessa, Scarphe, fair Augeae,"
1083,BOOK II.,"Tarphe, and Thronium about the river Boagrius. With him there"
1084,BOOK II.,came forty ships of the Locrians who dwell beyond Euboea.
1085,BOOK II.,
1086,BOOK II.,"The fierce Abantes held Euboea with its cities, Chalcis, Eretria,"
1087,BOOK II.,"Histiaea rich in vines, Cerinthus upon the sea, and the"
1088,BOOK II.,rock-perched town of Dium; with them were also the men of
1089,BOOK II.,Carystus and Styra; Elephenor of the race of Mars was in command
1090,BOOK II.,"of these; he was son of Chalcodon, and chief over all the"
1091,BOOK II.,"Abantes. With him they came, fleet of foot and wearing their hair"
1092,BOOK II.,"long behind, brave warriors, who would ever strive to tear open"
1093,BOOK II.,the corslets of their foes with their long ashen spears. Of these
1094,BOOK II.,there came fifty ships.
1095,BOOK II.,
1096,BOOK II.,"And they that held the strong city of Athens, the people of great"
1097,BOOK II.,"Erechtheus, who was born of the soil itself, but Jove’s daughter,"
1098,BOOK II.,"Minerva, fostered him, and established him at Athens in her own"
1099,BOOK II.,"rich sanctuary. There, year by year, the Athenian youths worship"
1100,BOOK II.,him with sacrifices of bulls and rams. These were commanded by
1101,BOOK II.,"Menestheus, son of Peteos. No man living could equal him in the"
1102,BOOK II.,marshalling of chariots and foot soldiers. Nestor could alone
1103,BOOK II.,"rival him, for he was older. With him there came fifty ships."
1104,BOOK II.,
1105,BOOK II.,"Ajax brought twelve ships from Salamis, and stationed them"
1106,BOOK II.,alongside those of the Athenians.
1107,BOOK II.,
1108,BOOK II.,"The men of Argos, again, and those who held the walls of Tiryns,"
1109,BOOK II.,"with Hermione, and Asine upon the gulf; Troezene, Eionae, and the"
1110,BOOK II.,"vineyard lands of Epidaurus; the Achaean youths, moreover, who"
1111,BOOK II.,came from Aegina and Mases; these were led by Diomed of the loud
1112,BOOK II.,"battle-cry, and Sthenelus son of famed Capaneus. With them in"
1113,BOOK II.,"command was Euryalus, son of king Mecisteus, son of Talaus; but"
1114,BOOK II.,Diomed was chief over them all. With these there came eighty
1115,BOOK II.,ships.
1116,BOOK II.,
1117,BOOK II.,"Those who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and"
1118,BOOK II.,"Cleonae; Orneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned"
1119,BOOK II.,"of old; Hyperesia, high Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the"
1120,BOOK II.,coast-land round about Helice; these sent a hundred ships under
1121,BOOK II.,"the command of King Agamemnon, son of Atreus. His force was far"
1122,BOOK II.,"both finest and most numerous, and in their midst was the king"
1123,BOOK II.,"himself, all glorious in his armour of gleaming bronze—foremost"
1124,BOOK II.,"among the heroes, for he was the greatest king, and had most men"
1125,BOOK II.,under him.
1126,BOOK II.,
1127,BOOK II.,"And those that dwelt in Lacedaemon, lying low among the hills,"
1128,BOOK II.,"Pharis, Sparta, with Messe the haunt of doves; Bryseae, Augeae,"
1129,BOOK II.,"Amyclae, and Helos upon the sea; Laas, moreover, and Oetylus;"
1130,BOOK II.,"these were led by Menelaus of the loud battle-cry, brother to"
1131,BOOK II.,"Agamemnon, and of them there were sixty ships, drawn up apart"
1132,BOOK II.,"from the others. Among them went Menelaus himself, strong in"
1133,BOOK II.,"zeal, urging his men to fight; for he longed to avenge the toil"
1134,BOOK II.,and sorrow that he had suffered for the sake of Helen.
1135,BOOK II.,
1136,BOOK II.,"The men of Pylos and Arene, and Thryum where is the ford of the"
1137,BOOK II.,"river Alpheus; strong Aipy, Cyparisseis, and Amphigenea; Pteleum,"
1138,BOOK II.,"Helos, and Dorium, where the Muses met Thamyris, and stilled his"
1139,BOOK II.,"minstrelsy for ever. He was returning from Oechalia, where"
1140,BOOK II.,"Eurytus lived and reigned, and boasted that he would surpass even"
1141,BOOK II.,"the Muses, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, if they should sing"
1142,BOOK II.,"against him; whereon they were angry, and maimed him. They robbed"
1143,BOOK II.,"him of his divine power of song, and thenceforth he could strike"
1144,BOOK II.,"the lyre no more. These were commanded by Nestor, knight of"
1145,BOOK II.,"Gerene, and with him there came ninety ships."
1146,BOOK II.,
1147,BOOK II.,"And those that held Arcadia, under the high mountain of Cyllene,"
1148,BOOK II.,"near the tomb of Aepytus, where the people fight hand to hand;"
1149,BOOK II.,"the men of Pheneus also, and Orchomenus rich in flocks; of"
1150,BOOK II.,"Rhipae, Stratie, and bleak Enispe; of Tegea and fair Mantinea; of"
1151,BOOK II.,Stymphelus and Parrhasia; of these King Agapenor son of Ancaeus
1152,BOOK II.,"was commander, and they had sixty ships. Many Arcadians, good"
1153,BOOK II.,"soldiers, came in each one of them, but Agamemnon found them the"
1154,BOOK II.,"ships in which to cross the sea, for they were not a people that"
1155,BOOK II.,occupied their business upon the waters.
1156,BOOK II.,
1157,BOOK II.,"The men, moreover, of Buprasium and of Elis, so much of it as is"
1158,BOOK II.,"enclosed between Hyrmine, Myrsinus upon the sea-shore, the rock"
1159,BOOK II.,"Olene and Alesium. These had four leaders, and each of them had"
1160,BOOK II.,"ten ships, with many Epeans on board. Their captains were"
1161,BOOK II.,"Amphimachus and Thalpius—the one, son of Cteatus, and the other,"
1162,BOOK II.,"of Eurytus—both of the race of Actor. The two others were Diores,"
1163,BOOK II.,"son of Amarynceus, and Polyxenus, son of King Agasthenes, son of"
1164,BOOK II.,Augeas.
1165,BOOK II.,
1166,BOOK II.,"And those of Dulichium with the sacred Echinean islands, who"
1167,BOOK II.,"dwelt beyond the sea off Elis; these were led by Meges, peer of"
1168,BOOK II.,"Mars, and the son of valiant Phyleus, dear to Jove, who"
1169,BOOK II.,"quarrelled with his father, and went to settle in Dulichium. With"
1170,BOOK II.,him there came forty ships.
1171,BOOK II.,
1172,BOOK II.,"Ulysses led the brave Cephallenians, who held Ithaca, Neritum"
1173,BOOK II.,"with its forests, Crocylea, rugged Aegilips, Samos and Zacynthus,"
1174,BOOK II.,with the mainland also that was over against the islands. These
1175,BOOK II.,"were led by Ulysses, peer of Jove in counsel, and with him there"
1176,BOOK II.,came twelve ships.
1177,BOOK II.,
1178,BOOK II.,"Thoas, son of Andraemon, commanded the Aetolians, who dwelt in"
1179,BOOK II.,"Pleuron, Olenus, Pylene, Chalcis by the sea, and rocky Calydon,"
1180,BOOK II.,"for the great king Oeneus had now no sons living, and was himself"
1181,BOOK II.,"dead, as was also golden-haired Meleager, who had been set over"
1182,BOOK II.,the Aetolians to be their king. And with Thoas there came forty
1183,BOOK II.,ships.
1184,BOOK II.,
1185,BOOK II.,"The famous spearsman Idomeneus led the Cretans, who held Cnossus,"
1186,BOOK II.,"and the well-walled city of Gortys; Lyctus also, Miletus and"
1187,BOOK II.,Lycastus that lies upon the chalk; the populous towns of Phaestus
1188,BOOK II.,"and Rhytium, with the other peoples that dwelt in the hundred"
1189,BOOK II.,"cities of Crete. All these were led by Idomeneus, and by"
1190,BOOK II.,"Meriones, peer of murderous Mars. And with these there came"
1191,BOOK II.,eighty ships.
1192,BOOK II.,
1193,BOOK II.,"Tlepolemus, son of Hercules, a man both brave and large of"
1194,BOOK II.,"stature, brought nine ships of lordly warriors from Rhodes. These"
1195,BOOK II.,dwelt in Rhodes which is divided among the three cities of
1196,BOOK II.,"Lindus, Ielysus, and Cameirus, that lies upon the chalk. These"
1197,BOOK II.,"were commanded by Tlepolemus, son of Hercules by Astyochea, whom"
1198,BOOK II.,"he had carried off from Ephyra, on the river Selleis, after"
1199,BOOK II.,"sacking many cities of valiant warriors. When Tlepolemus grew up,"
1200,BOOK II.,"he killed his father’s uncle Licymnius, who had been a famous"
1201,BOOK II.,"warrior in his time, but was then grown old. On this he built"
1202,BOOK II.,"himself a fleet, gathered a great following, and fled beyond the"
1203,BOOK II.,"sea, for he was menaced by the other sons and grandsons of"
1204,BOOK II.,"Hercules. After a voyage, during which he suffered great"
1205,BOOK II.,"hardship, he came to Rhodes, where the people divided into three"
1206,BOOK II.,"communities, according to their tribes, and were dearly loved by"
1207,BOOK II.,"Jove, the lord of gods and men; wherefore the son of Saturn"
1208,BOOK II.,showered down great riches upon them.
1209,BOOK II.,
1210,BOOK II.,"And Nireus brought three ships from Syme—Nireus, who was the"
1211,BOOK II.,handsomest man that came up under Ilius of all the Danaans after
1212,BOOK II.,"the son of Peleus—but he was a man of no substance, and had but a"
1213,BOOK II.,small following.
1214,BOOK II.,
1215,BOOK II.,"And those that held Nisyrus, Crapathus, and Casus, with Cos, the"
1216,BOOK II.,"city of Eurypylus, and the Calydnian islands, these were"
1217,BOOK II.,"commanded by Pheidippus and Antiphus, two sons of King Thessalus"
1218,BOOK II.,the son of Hercules. And with them there came thirty ships.
1219,BOOK II.,
1220,BOOK II.,"Those again who held Pelasgic Argos, Alos, Alope, and Trachis;"
1221,BOOK II.,"and those of Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women, who were"
1222,BOOK II.,"called Myrmidons, Hellenes, and Achaeans; these had fifty ships,"
1223,BOOK II.,over which Achilles was in command. But they now took no part in
1224,BOOK II.,"the war, inasmuch as there was no one to marshal them; for"
1225,BOOK II.,"Achilles stayed by his ships, furious about the loss of the girl"
1226,BOOK II.,"Briseis, whom he had taken from Lyrnessus at his own great peril,"
1227,BOOK II.,"when he had sacked Lyrnessus and Thebe, and had overthrown Mynes"
1228,BOOK II.,"and Epistrophus, sons of king Evenor, son of Selepus. For her"
1229,BOOK II.,"sake Achilles was still grieving, but ere long he was again to"
1230,BOOK II.,join them.
1231,BOOK II.,
1232,BOOK II.,"And those that held Phylace and the flowery meadows of Pyrasus,"
1233,BOOK II.,"sanctuary of Ceres; Iton, the mother of sheep; Antrum upon the"
1234,BOOK II.,"sea, and Pteleum that lies upon the grass lands. Of these brave"
1235,BOOK II.,"Protesilaus had been captain while he was yet alive, but he was"
1236,BOOK II.,now lying under the earth. He had left a wife behind him in
1237,BOOK II.,"Phylace to tear her cheeks in sorrow, and his house was only half"
1238,BOOK II.,"finished, for he was slain by a Dardanian warrior while leaping"
1239,BOOK II.,"foremost of the Achaeans upon the soil of Troy. Still, though his"
1240,BOOK II.,"people mourned their chieftain, they were not without a leader,"
1241,BOOK II.,"for Podarces, of the race of Mars, marshalled them; he was son of"
1242,BOOK II.,"Iphiclus, rich in sheep, who was the son of Phylacus, and he was"
1243,BOOK II.,"own brother to Protesilaus, only younger, Protesilaus being at"
1244,BOOK II.,once the elder and the more valiant. So the people were not
1245,BOOK II.,"without a leader, though they mourned him whom they had lost."
1246,BOOK II.,With him there came forty ships.
1247,BOOK II.,
1248,BOOK II.,"And those that held Pherae by the Boebean lake, with Boebe,"
1249,BOOK II.,"Glaphyrae, and the populous city of Iolcus, these with their"
1250,BOOK II.,"eleven ships were led by Eumelus, son of Admetus, whom Alcestis"
1251,BOOK II.,"bore to him, loveliest of the daughters of Pelias."
1252,BOOK II.,
1253,BOOK II.,"And those that held Methone and Thaumacia, with Meliboea and"
1254,BOOK II.,"rugged Olizon, these were led by the skilful archer Philoctetes,"
1255,BOOK II.,"and they had seven ships, each with fifty oarsmen all of them"
1256,BOOK II.,good archers; but Philoctetes was lying in great pain in the
1257,BOOK II.,"Island of Lemnos, where the sons of the Achaeans left him, for he"
1258,BOOK II.,had been bitten by a poisonous water snake. There he lay sick and
1259,BOOK II.,"sorry, and full soon did the Argives come to miss him. But his"
1260,BOOK II.,"people, though they felt his loss were not leaderless, for Medon,"
1261,BOOK II.,"the bastard son of Oileus by Rhene, set them in array."
1262,BOOK II.,
1263,BOOK II.,"Those, again, of Tricca and the stony region of Ithome, and they"
1264,BOOK II.,"that held Oechalia, the city of Oechalian Eurytus, these were"
1265,BOOK II.,"commanded by the two sons of Aesculapius, skilled in the art of"
1266,BOOK II.,"healing, Podalirius and Machaon. And with them there came thirty"
1267,BOOK II.,ships.
1268,BOOK II.,
1269,BOOK II.,"The men, moreover, of Ormenius, and by the fountain of Hypereia,"
1270,BOOK II.,"with those that held Asterius, and the white crests of Titanus,"
1271,BOOK II.,"these were led by Eurypylus, the son of Euaemon, and with them"
1272,BOOK II.,there came forty ships.
1273,BOOK II.,
1274,BOOK II.,"Those that held Argissa and Gyrtone, Orthe, Elone, and the white"
1275,BOOK II.,"city of Oloosson, of these brave Polypoetes was leader. He was"
1276,BOOK II.,"son of Pirithous, who was son of Jove himself, for Hippodameia"
1277,BOOK II.,bore him to Pirithous on the day when he took his revenge on the
1278,BOOK II.,shaggy mountain savages and drove them from Mt. Pelion to the
1279,BOOK II.,"Aithices. But Polypoetes was not sole in command, for with him"
1280,BOOK II.,"was Leonteus, of the race of Mars, who was son of Coronus, the"
1281,BOOK II.,son of Caeneus. And with these there came forty ships.
1282,BOOK II.,
1283,BOOK II.,"Guneus brought two and twenty ships from Cyphus, and he was"
1284,BOOK II.,"followed by the Enienes and the valiant Peraebi, who dwelt about"
1285,BOOK II.,"wintry Dodona, and held the lands round the lovely river"
1286,BOOK II.,"Titaresius, which sends its waters into the Peneus. They do not"
1287,BOOK II.,"mingle with the silver eddies of the Peneus, but flow on the top"
1288,BOOK II.,of them like oil; for the Titaresius is a branch of dread Orcus
1289,BOOK II.,and of the river Styx.
1290,BOOK II.,
1291,BOOK II.,"Of the Magnetes, Prothous son of Tenthredon was commander. They"
1292,BOOK II.,were they that dwelt about the river Peneus and Mt. Pelion.
1293,BOOK II.,"Prothous, fleet of foot, was their leader, and with him there"
1294,BOOK II.,came forty ships.
1295,BOOK II.,
1296,BOOK II.,"Such were the chiefs and princes of the Danaans. Who, then, O"
1297,BOOK II.,"Muse, was the foremost, whether man or horse, among those that"
1298,BOOK II.,followed after the sons of Atreus?
1299,BOOK II.,
1300,BOOK II.,"Of the horses, those of the son of Pheres were by far the finest."
1301,BOOK II.,"They were driven by Eumelus, and were as fleet as birds. They"
1302,BOOK II.,"were of the same age and colour, and perfectly matched in height."
1303,BOOK II.,"Apollo, of the silver bow, had bred them in Perea—both of them"
1304,BOOK II.,"mares, and terrible as Mars in battle. Of the men, Ajax, son of"
1305,BOOK II.,"Telamon, was much the foremost so long as Achilles’ anger lasted,"
1306,BOOK II.,for Achilles excelled him greatly and he had also better horses;
1307,BOOK II.,but Achilles was now holding aloof at his ships by reason of his
1308,BOOK II.,"quarrel with Agamemnon, and his people passed their time upon the"
1309,BOOK II.,"sea-shore, throwing discs or aiming with spears at a mark, and in"
1310,BOOK II.,"archery. Their horses stood each by his own chariot, champing"
1311,BOOK II.,"lotus and wild celery. The chariots were housed under cover, but"
1312,BOOK II.,"their owners, for lack of leadership, wandered hither and thither"
1313,BOOK II.,about the host and went not forth to fight.
1314,BOOK II.,
1315,BOOK II.,"Thus marched the host like a consuming fire, and the earth"
1316,BOOK II.,groaned beneath them when the lord of thunder is angry and lashes
1317,BOOK II.,"the land about Typhoeus among the Arimi, where they say Typhoeus"
1318,BOOK II.,lies. Even so did the earth groan beneath them as they sped over
1319,BOOK II.,the plain.
1320,BOOK II.,
1321,BOOK II.,"And now Iris, fleet as the wind, was sent by Jove to tell the bad"
1322,BOOK II.,"news among the Trojans. They were gathered in assembly, old and"
1323,BOOK II.,"young, at Priam’s gates, and Iris came close up to Priam,"
1324,BOOK II.,"speaking with the voice of Priam’s son Polites, who, being fleet"
1325,BOOK II.,"of foot, was stationed as watchman for the Trojans on the tomb of"
1326,BOOK II.,"old Aesyetes, to look out for any sally of the Achaeans. In his"
1327,BOOK II.,"likeness Iris spoke, saying, “Old man, you talk idly, as in time"
1328,BOOK II.,"of peace, while war is at hand. I have been in many a battle, but"
1329,BOOK II.,never yet saw such a host as is now advancing. They are crossing
1330,BOOK II.,the plain to attack the city as thick as leaves or as the sands
1331,BOOK II.,"of the sea. Hector, I charge you above all others, do as I say."
1332,BOOK II.,There are many allies dispersed about the city of Priam from
1333,BOOK II.,"distant places and speaking divers tongues. Therefore, let each"
1334,BOOK II.,"chief give orders to his own people, setting them severally in"
1335,BOOK II.,array and leading them forth to battle.”
1336,BOOK II.,
1337,BOOK II.,"Thus she spoke, but Hector knew that it was the goddess, and at"
1338,BOOK II.,once broke up the assembly. The men flew to arms; all the gates
1339,BOOK II.,"were opened, and the people thronged through them, horse and"
1340,BOOK II.,"foot, with the tramp as of a great multitude."
1341,BOOK II.,
1342,BOOK II.,"Now there is a high mound before the city, rising by itself upon"
1343,BOOK II.,"the plain. Men call it Batieia, but the gods know that it is the"
1344,BOOK II.,tomb of lithe Myrine. Here the Trojans and their allies divided
1345,BOOK II.,their forces.
1346,BOOK II.,
1347,BOOK II.,"Priam’s son, great Hector of the gleaming helmet, commanded the"
1348,BOOK II.,"Trojans, and with him were arrayed by far the greater number and"
1349,BOOK II.,most valiant of those who were longing for the fray.
1350,BOOK II.,
1351,BOOK II.,"The Dardanians were led by brave Aeneas, whom Venus bore to"
1352,BOOK II.,"Anchises, when she, goddess though she was, had lain with him"
1353,BOOK II.,"upon the mountain slopes of Ida. He was not alone, for with him"
1354,BOOK II.,"were the two sons of Antenor, Archelochus and Acamas, both"
1355,BOOK II.,skilled in all the arts of war.
1356,BOOK II.,
1357,BOOK II.,"They that dwelt in Telea under the lowest spurs of Mt. Ida, men"
1358,BOOK II.,"of substance, who drink the limpid waters of the Aesepus, and are"
1359,BOOK II.,"of Trojan blood—these were led by Pandarus son of Lycaon, whom"
1360,BOOK II.,Apollo had taught to use the bow.
1361,BOOK II.,
1362,BOOK II.,"They that held Adresteia and the land of Apaesus, with Pityeia,"
1363,BOOK II.,and the high mountain of Tereia—these were led by Adrestus and
1364,BOOK II.,"Amphius, whose breastplate was of linen. These were the sons of"
1365,BOOK II.,"Merops of Percote, who excelled in all kinds of divination. He"
1366,BOOK II.,"told them not to take part in the war, but they gave him no heed,"
1367,BOOK II.,for fate lured them to destruction.
1368,BOOK II.,
1369,BOOK II.,"They that dwelt about Percote and Practius, with Sestos, Abydos,"
1370,BOOK II.,"and Arisbe—these were led by Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a brave"
1371,BOOK II.,"commander—Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, whom his powerful dark bay"
1372,BOOK II.,"steeds, of the breed that comes from the river Selleis, had"
1373,BOOK II.,brought from Arisbe.
1374,BOOK II.,
1375,BOOK II.,"Hippothous led the tribes of Pelasgian spearsmen, who dwelt in"
1376,BOOK II.,"fertile Larissa—Hippothous, and Pylaeus of the race of Mars, two"
1377,BOOK II.,"sons of the Pelasgian Lethus, son of Teutamus."
1378,BOOK II.,
1379,BOOK II.,Acamas and the warrior Peirous commanded the Thracians and those
1380,BOOK II.,that came from beyond the mighty stream of the Hellespont.
1381,BOOK II.,
1382,BOOK II.,"Euphemus, son of Troezenus, the son of Ceos, was captain of the"
1383,BOOK II.,Ciconian spearsmen.
1384,BOOK II.,
1385,BOOK II.,"Pyraechmes led the Paeonian archers from distant Amydon, by the"
1386,BOOK II.,"broad waters of the river Axius, the fairest that flow upon the"
1387,BOOK II.,earth.
1388,BOOK II.,
1389,BOOK II.,The Paphlagonians were commanded by stout-hearted Pylaemanes from
1390,BOOK II.,"Enetae, where the mules run wild in herds. These were they that"
1391,BOOK II.,"held Cytorus and the country round Sesamus, with the cities by"
1392,BOOK II.,"the river Parthenius, Cromna, Aegialus, and lofty Erithini."
1393,BOOK II.,
1394,BOOK II.,Odius and Epistrophus were captains over the Halizoni from
1395,BOOK II.,"distant Alybe, where there are mines of silver."
1396,BOOK II.,
1397,BOOK II.,"Chromis, and Ennomus the augur, led the Mysians, but his skill in"
1398,BOOK II.,"augury availed not to save him from destruction, for he fell by"
1399,BOOK II.,"the hand of the fleet descendant of Aeacus in the river, where he"

1408,BOOK II.,
1409,BOOK II.,"Nastes led the Carians, men of a strange speech. These held"
1410,BOOK II.,"Miletus and the wooded mountain of Phthires, with the water of"
1411,BOOK II.,the river Maeander and the lofty crests of Mt. Mycale. These were
1412,BOOK II.,"commanded by Nastes and Amphimachus, the brave sons of Nomion. He"
1413,BOOK II.,"came into the fight with gold about him, like a girl; fool that"
1414,BOOK II.,"he was, his gold was of no avail to save him, for he fell in the"

1431,BOOK III.,
1432,BOOK III.,"When the companies were thus arrayed, each under its own captain,"
1433,BOOK III.,the Trojans advanced as a flight of wild-fowl or cranes that
1434,BOOK III.,scream overhead when rain and winter drive them over the flowing
1435,BOOK III.,"waters of Oceanus to bring death and destruction on the Pygmies,"
1436,BOOK III.,and they wrangle in the air as they fly; but the Achaeans marched
1437,BOOK III.,"silently, in high heart, and minded to stand by one another."
1438,BOOK III.,
1439,BOOK III.,As when the south wind spreads a curtain of mist upon the
1440,BOOK III.,"mountain tops, bad for shepherds but better than night for"
1441,BOOK III.,"thieves, and a man can see no further than he can throw a stone,"
1442,BOOK III.,even so rose the dust from under their feet as they made all
1443,BOOK III.,speed over the plain.
1444,BOOK III.,
1445,BOOK III.,"When they were close up with one another, Alexandrus came forward"
1446,BOOK III.,as champion on the Trojan side. On his shoulders he bore the skin
1447,BOOK III.,"of a panther, his bow, and his sword, and he brandished two"
1448,BOOK III.,spears shod with bronze as a challenge to the bravest of the
1449,BOOK III.,Achaeans to meet him in single fight. Menelaus saw him thus
1450,BOOK III.,"stride out before the ranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that"
1451,BOOK III.,"lights on the carcase of some goat or horned stag, and devours it"
1452,BOOK III.,"there and then, though dogs and youths set upon him. Even thus"
1453,BOOK III.,"was Menelaus glad when his eyes caught sight of Alexandrus, for"
1454,BOOK III.,"he deemed that now he should be revenged. He sprang, therefore,"
1455,BOOK III.,"from his chariot, clad in his suit of armour."
1456,BOOK III.,
1457,BOOK III.,"Alexandrus quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank in"
1458,BOOK III.,fear of his life under cover of his men. As one who starts back
1459,BOOK III.,"affrighted, trembling and pale, when he comes suddenly upon a"
1460,BOOK III.,"serpent in some mountain glade, even so did Alexandrus plunge"
1461,BOOK III.,"into the throng of Trojan warriors, terror-stricken at the sight"
1462,BOOK III.,of the son of Atreus.
1463,BOOK III.,
1464,BOOK III.,"Then Hector upbraided him. “Paris,” said he, “evil-hearted Paris,"
1465,BOOK III.,"fair to see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you"
1466,BOOK III.,"had never been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than"
1467,BOOK III.,live to be disgraced and looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans
1468,BOOK III.,mock at us and say that we have sent one to champion us who is
1469,BOOK III.,"fair to see but who has neither wit nor courage? Did you not,"
1470,BOOK III.,"such as you are, get your following together and sail beyond the"
1471,BOOK III.,seas? Did you not from your a far country carry off a lovely
1472,BOOK III.,woman wedded among a people of warriors—to bring sorrow upon your
1473,BOOK III.,"father, your city, and your whole country, but joy to your"
1474,BOOK III.,"enemies, and hang-dog shamefacedness to yourself? And now can you"
1475,BOOK III.,not dare face Menelaus and learn what manner of man he is whose
1476,BOOK III.,wife you have stolen? Where indeed would be your lyre and your
1477,BOOK III.,"love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair favour, when you"
1478,BOOK III.,were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are a weak-kneed
1479,BOOK III.,"people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones for the"
1480,BOOK III.,wrongs you have done them.”
1481,BOOK III.,
1482,BOOK III.,"And Alexandrus answered, “Hector, your rebuke is just. You are"
1483,BOOK III.,"hard as the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and"
1484,BOOK III.,"cleaves the timber to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen"
1485,BOOK III.,"is the edge of your scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts"
1486,BOOK III.,that golden Venus has given me; they are precious; let not a man
1487,BOOK III.,"disdain them, for the gods give them where they are minded, and"
1488,BOOK III.,none can have them for the asking. If you would have me do battle
1489,BOOK III.,"with Menelaus, bid the Trojans and Achaeans take their seats,"
1490,BOOK III.,while he and I fight in their midst for Helen and all her wealth.
1491,BOOK III.,Let him who shall be victorious and prove to be the better man
1492,BOOK III.,"take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his home, but let"
1493,BOOK III.,the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace whereby you Trojans
1494,BOOK III.,"shall stay here in Troy, while the others go home to Argos and"
1495,BOOK III.,the land of the Achaeans.”
1496,BOOK III.,
1497,BOOK III.,"When Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the"
1498,BOOK III.,"Trojan ranks holding his spear by the middle to keep them back,"
1499,BOOK III.,and they all sat down at his bidding: but the Achaeans still
1500,BOOK III.,"aimed at him with stones and arrows, till Agamemnon shouted to"
1501,BOOK III.,"them saying, “Hold, Argives, shoot not, sons of the Achaeans;"
1502,BOOK III.,Hector desires to speak.”
1503,BOOK III.,
1504,BOOK III.,"They ceased taking aim and were still, whereon Hector spoke."
1505,BOOK III.,"“Hear from my mouth,” said he, “Trojans and Achaeans, the saying"
1506,BOOK III.,"of Alexandrus, through whom this quarrel has come about. He bids"
1507,BOOK III.,"the Trojans and Achaeans lay their armour upon the ground, while"
1508,BOOK III.,he and Menelaus fight in the midst of you for Helen and all her
1509,BOOK III.,wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and prove to be the
1510,BOOK III.,"better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them to his"
1511,BOOK III.,"own home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace.”"
1512,BOOK III.,
1513,BOOK III.,"Thus he spoke, and they all held their peace, till Menelaus of"
1514,BOOK III.,"the loud battle-cry addressed them. “And now,” he said, “hear me"
1515,BOOK III.,"too, for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I deem that the"
1516,BOOK III.,"parting of Achaeans and Trojans is at hand, as well it may be,"
1517,BOOK III.,seeing how much have suffered for my quarrel with Alexandrus and
1518,BOOK III.,"the wrong he did me. Let him who shall die, die, and let the"
1519,BOOK III.,"others fight no more. Bring, then, two lambs, a white ram and a"
1520,BOOK III.,"black ewe, for Earth and Sun, and we will bring a third for Jove."
1521,BOOK III.,"Moreover, you shall bid Priam come, that he may swear to the"
1522,BOOK III.,"covenant himself; for his sons are high-handed and ill to trust,"
1523,BOOK III.,and the oaths of Jove must not be transgressed or taken in vain.
1524,BOOK III.,"Young men’s minds are light as air, but when an old man comes he"
1525,BOOK III.,"looks before and after, deeming that which shall be fairest upon"
1526,BOOK III.,both sides.”
1527,BOOK III.,
1528,BOOK III.,"The Trojans and Achaeans were glad when they heard this, for they"
1529,BOOK III.,thought that they should now have rest. They backed their
1530,BOOK III.,"chariots toward the ranks, got out of them, and put off their"
1531,BOOK III.,"armour, laying it down upon the ground; and the hosts were near"
1532,BOOK III.,to one another with a little space between them. Hector sent two
1533,BOOK III.,"messengers to the city to bring the lambs and to bid Priam come,"
1534,BOOK III.,while Agamemnon told Talthybius to fetch the other lamb from the
1535,BOOK III.,"ships, and he did as Agamemnon had said."
1536,BOOK III.,
1537,BOOK III.,"Meanwhile Iris went to Helen in the form of her sister-in-law,"
1538,BOOK III.,"wife of the son of Antenor, for Helicaon, son of Antenor, had"
1539,BOOK III.,"married Laodice, the fairest of Priam’s daughters. She found her"
1540,BOOK III.,"in her own room, working at a great web of purple linen, on which"
1541,BOOK III.,"she was embroidering the battles between Trojans and Achaeans,"
1542,BOOK III.,that Mars had made them fight for her sake. Iris then came close
1543,BOOK III.,"up to her and said, “Come hither, child, and see the strange"
1544,BOOK III.,doings of the Trojans and Achaeans. Till now they have been
1545,BOOK III.,"warring upon the plain, mad with lust of battle, but now they"
1546,BOOK III.,"have left off fighting, and are leaning upon their shields,"
1547,BOOK III.,sitting still with their spears planted beside them. Alexandrus
1548,BOOK III.,"and Menelaus are going to fight about yourself, and you are to be"
1549,BOOK III.,the wife of him who is the victor.”
1550,BOOK III.,
1551,BOOK III.,"Thus spoke the goddess, and Helen’s heart yearned after her"
1552,BOOK III.,"former husband, her city, and her parents. She threw a white"
1553,BOOK III.,"mantle over her head, and hurried from her room, weeping as she"
1554,BOOK III.,"went, not alone, but attended by two of her handmaids, Aethrae,"
1555,BOOK III.,"daughter of Pittheus, and Clymene. And straightway they were at"
1556,BOOK III.,the Scaean gates.
1557,BOOK III.,
1558,BOOK III.,"The two sages, Ucalegon and Antenor, elders of the people, were"
1559,BOOK III.,"seated by the Scaean gates, with Priam, Panthous, Thymoetes,"
1560,BOOK III.,"Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the race of Mars. These were too"
1561,BOOK III.,"old to fight, but they were fluent orators, and sat on the tower"
1562,BOOK III.,like cicales that chirrup delicately from the boughs of some high
1563,BOOK III.,"tree in a wood. When they saw Helen coming towards the tower,"
1564,BOOK III.,"they said softly to one another, “Small wonder that Trojans and"
1565,BOOK III.,"Achaeans should endure so much and so long, for the sake of a"
1566,BOOK III.,"woman so marvellously and divinely lovely. Still, fair though she"
1567,BOOK III.,"be, let them take her and go, or she will breed sorrow for us and"
1568,BOOK III.,for our children after us.”
1569,BOOK III.,
1570,BOOK III.,"But Priam bade her draw nigh. “My child,” said he, “take your"
1571,BOOK III.,"seat in front of me that you may see your former husband, your"
1572,BOOK III.,"kinsmen and your friends. I lay no blame upon you, it is the"
1573,BOOK III.,"gods, not you who are to blame. It is they that have brought"
1574,BOOK III.,"about this terrible war with the Achaeans. Tell me, then, who is"
1575,BOOK III.,yonder huge hero so great and goodly? I have seen men taller by a
1576,BOOK III.,"head, but none so comely and so royal. Surely he must be a king.”"
1577,BOOK III.,
1578,BOOK III.,"“Sir,” answered Helen, “father of my husband, dear and reverend"
1579,BOOK III.,"in my eyes, would that I had chosen death rather than to have"
1580,BOOK III.,"come here with your son, far from my bridal chamber, my friends,"
1581,BOOK III.,"my darling daughter, and all the companions of my girlhood. But"
1582,BOOK III.,"it was not to be, and my lot is one of tears and sorrow. As for"
1583,BOOK III.,"your question, the hero of whom you ask is Agamemnon, son of"
1584,BOOK III.,"Atreus, a good king and a brave soldier, brother-in-law as surely"
1585,BOOK III.,"as that he lives, to my abhorred and miserable self.”"
1586,BOOK III.,
1587,BOOK III.,"The old man marvelled at him and said, “Happy son of Atreus,"
1588,BOOK III.,child of good fortune. I see that the Achaeans are subject to you
1589,BOOK III.,"in great multitudes. When I was in Phrygia I saw much horsemen,"
1590,BOOK III.,"the people of Otreus and of Mygdon, who were camping upon the"
1591,BOOK III.,"banks of the river Sangarius; I was their ally, and with them"
1592,BOOK III.,"when the Amazons, peers of men, came up against them, but even"
1593,BOOK III.,they were not so many as the Achaeans.”
1594,BOOK III.,
1595,BOOK III.,"The old man next looked upon Ulysses; “Tell me,” he said, “who is"
1596,BOOK III.,"that other, shorter by a head than Agamemnon, but broader across"
1597,BOOK III.,"the chest and shoulders? His armour is laid upon the ground, and"
1598,BOOK III.,he stalks in front of the ranks as it were some great woolly ram
1599,BOOK III.,ordering his ewes.”
1600,BOOK III.,
1601,BOOK III.,"And Helen answered, “He is Ulysses, a man of great craft, son of"
1602,BOOK III.,"Laertes. He was born in rugged Ithaca, and excels in all manner"
1603,BOOK III.,of stratagems and subtle cunning.”
1604,BOOK III.,
1605,BOOK III.,"On this Antenor said, “Madam, you have spoken truly. Ulysses once"
1606,BOOK III.,"came here as envoy about yourself, and Menelaus with him. I"
1607,BOOK III.,"received them in my own house, and therefore know both of them by"
1608,BOOK III.,sight and conversation. When they stood up in presence of the
1609,BOOK III.,"assembled Trojans, Menelaus was the broader shouldered, but when"
1610,BOOK III.,both were seated Ulysses had the more royal presence. After a
1611,BOOK III.,"time they delivered their message, and the speech of Menelaus ran"
1612,BOOK III.,"trippingly on the tongue; he did not say much, for he was a man"
1613,BOOK III.,"of few words, but he spoke very clearly and to the point, though"
1614,BOOK III.,"he was the younger man of the two; Ulysses, on the other hand,"
1615,BOOK III.,"when he rose to speak, was at first silent and kept his eyes"
1616,BOOK III.,fixed upon the ground. There was no play nor graceful movement of
1617,BOOK III.,his sceptre; he kept it straight and stiff like a man unpractised
1618,BOOK III.,in oratory—one might have taken him for a mere churl or
1619,BOOK III.,"simpleton; but when he raised his voice, and the words came"
1620,BOOK III.,"driving from his deep chest like winter snow before the wind,"
1621,BOOK III.,"then there was none to touch him, and no man thought further of"
1622,BOOK III.,what he looked like.”
1623,BOOK III.,
1624,BOOK III.,"Priam then caught sight of Ajax and asked, “Who is that great and"
1625,BOOK III.,goodly warrior whose head and broad shoulders tower above the
1626,BOOK III.,rest of the Argives?”
1627,BOOK III.,
1628,BOOK III.,"“That,” answered Helen, “is huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans,"
1629,BOOK III.,"and on the other side of him, among the Cretans, stands Idomeneus"
1630,BOOK III.,"looking like a god, and with the captains of the Cretans round"
1631,BOOK III.,him. Often did Menelaus receive him as a guest in our house when
1632,BOOK III.,"he came visiting us from Crete. I see, moreover, many other"
1633,BOOK III.,"Achaeans whose names I could tell you, but there are two whom I"
1634,BOOK III.,"can nowhere find, Castor, breaker of horses, and Pollux the"
1635,BOOK III.,"mighty boxer; they are children of my mother, and own brothers to"
1636,BOOK III.,"myself. Either they have not left Lacedaemon, or else, though"
1637,BOOK III.,"they have brought their ships, they will not show themselves in"
1638,BOOK III.,battle for the shame and disgrace that I have brought upon them.”
1639,BOOK III.,
1640,BOOK III.,She knew not that both these heroes were already lying under the
1641,BOOK III.,earth in their own land of Lacedaemon.
1642,BOOK III.,
1643,BOOK III.,Meanwhile the heralds were bringing the holy oath-offerings
1644,BOOK III.,"through the city—two lambs and a goatskin of wine, the gift of"
1645,BOOK III.,earth; and Idaeus brought the mixing-bowl and the cups of gold.
1646,BOOK III.,"He went up to Priam and said, “Son of Laomedon, the princes of"
1647,BOOK III.,the Trojans and Achaeans bid you come down on to the plain and
1648,BOOK III.,swear to a solemn covenant. Alexandrus and Menelaus are to fight
1649,BOOK III.,"for Helen in single combat, that she and all her wealth may go"
1650,BOOK III.,with him who is the victor. We are to swear to a solemn covenant
1651,BOOK III.,"of peace whereby we others shall dwell here in Troy, while the"
1652,BOOK III.,Achaeans return to Argos and the land of the Achaeans.”
1653,BOOK III.,
1654,BOOK III.,"The old man trembled as he heard, but bade his followers yoke the"
1655,BOOK III.,"horses, and they made all haste to do so. He mounted the chariot,"
1656,BOOK III.,"gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor took his seat beside"
1657,BOOK III.,him; they then drove through the Scaean gates on to the plain.
1658,BOOK III.,When they reached the ranks of the Trojans and Achaeans they left
1659,BOOK III.,"the chariot, and with measured pace advanced into the space"
1660,BOOK III.,between the hosts.
1661,BOOK III.,
1662,BOOK III.,Agamemnon and Ulysses both rose to meet them. The attendants
1663,BOOK III.,brought on the oath-offerings and mixed the wine in the
1664,BOOK III.,"mixing-bowls; they poured water over the hands of the chieftains,"
1665,BOOK III.,"and the son of Atreus drew the dagger that hung by his sword, and"
1666,BOOK III.,cut wool from the lambs’ heads; this the men-servants gave about
1667,BOOK III.,"among the Trojan and Achaean princes, and the son of Atreus"
1668,BOOK III.,"lifted up his hands in prayer. “Father Jove,” he cried, “that"
1669,BOOK III.,"rulest in Ida, most glorious in power, and thou oh Sun, that"
1670,BOOK III.,"seest and givest ear to all things, Earth and Rivers, and ye who"
1671,BOOK III.,in the realms below chastise the soul of him that has broken his
1672,BOOK III.,"oath, witness these rites and guard them, that they be not vain."
1673,BOOK III.,"If Alexandrus kills Menelaus, let him keep Helen and all her"
1674,BOOK III.,"wealth, while we sail home with our ships; but if Menelaus kills"
1675,BOOK III.,"Alexandrus, let the Trojans give back Helen and all that she has;"
1676,BOOK III.,let them moreover pay such fine to the Achaeans as shall be
1677,BOOK III.,"agreed upon, in testimony among those that shall be born"
1678,BOOK III.,hereafter. And if Priam and his sons refuse such fine when
1679,BOOK III.,"Alexandrus has fallen, then will I stay here and fight on till I"
1680,BOOK III.,have got satisfaction.”
1681,BOOK III.,
1682,BOOK III.,"As he spoke he drew his knife across the throats of the victims,"
1683,BOOK III.,"and laid them down gasping and dying upon the ground, for the"
1684,BOOK III.,knife had reft them of their strength. Then they poured wine from
1685,BOOK III.,"the mixing-bowl into the cups, and prayed to the everlasting"
1686,BOOK III.,"gods, saying, Trojans and Achaeans among one another, “Jove, most"
1687,BOOK III.,"great and glorious, and ye other everlasting gods, grant that the"
1688,BOOK III.,brains of them who shall first sin against their oaths—of them
1689,BOOK III.,"and their children—may be shed upon the ground even as this wine,"
1690,BOOK III.,and let their wives become the slaves of strangers.”
1691,BOOK III.,
1692,BOOK III.,"Thus they prayed, but not as yet would Jove grant them their"
1693,BOOK III.,"prayer. Then Priam, descendant of Dardanus, spoke, saying, “Hear"
1694,BOOK III.,"me, Trojans and Achaeans, I will now go back to the wind-beaten"
1695,BOOK III.,city of Ilius: I dare not with my own eyes witness this fight
1696,BOOK III.,"between my son and Menelaus, for Jove and the other immortals"
1697,BOOK III.,alone know which shall fall.”
1698,BOOK III.,
1699,BOOK III.,On this he laid the two lambs on his chariot and took his seat.
1700,BOOK III.,"He gathered the reins in his hand, and Antenor sat beside him;"
1701,BOOK III.,the two then went back to Ilius. Hector and Ulysses measured the
1702,BOOK III.,"ground, and cast lots from a helmet of bronze to see which should"
1703,BOOK III.,take aim first. Meanwhile the two hosts lifted up their hands and
1704,BOOK III.,"prayed saying, “Father Jove, that rulest from Ida, most glorious"
1705,BOOK III.,"in power, grant that he who first brought about this war between"
1706,BOOK III.,"us may die, and enter the house of Hades, while we others remain"
1707,BOOK III.,at peace and abide by our oaths.”
1708,BOOK III.,
1709,BOOK III.,"Great Hector now turned his head aside while he shook the helmet,"
1710,BOOK III.,and the lot of Paris flew out first. The others took their
1711,BOOK III.,"several stations, each by his horses and the place where his arms"
1712,BOOK III.,"were lying, while Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, put on his"
1713,BOOK III.,goodly armour. First he greaved his legs with greaves of good
1714,BOOK III.,make and fitted with ancle-clasps of silver; after this he donned
1715,BOOK III.,"the cuirass of his brother Lycaon, and fitted it to his own body;"
1716,BOOK III.,"he hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders,"
1717,BOOK III.,"and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his helmet,"
1718,BOOK III.,"well wrought, with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly"
1719,BOOK III.,"above it, and he grasped a redoubtable spear that suited his"
1720,BOOK III.,hands. In like fashion Menelaus also put on his armour.
1721,BOOK III.,
1722,BOOK III.,"When they had thus armed, each amid his own people, they strode"
1723,BOOK III.,"fierce of aspect into the open space, and both Trojans and"
1724,BOOK III.,Achaeans were struck with awe as they beheld them. They stood
1725,BOOK III.,"near one another on the measured ground, brandishing their"
1726,BOOK III.,"spears, and each furious against the other. Alexandrus aimed"
1727,BOOK III.,"first, and struck the round shield of the son of Atreus, but the"
1728,BOOK III.,"spear did not pierce it, for the shield turned its point."
1729,BOOK III.,"Menelaus next took aim, praying to Father Jove as he did so."
1730,BOOK III.,"“King Jove,” he said, “grant me revenge on Alexandrus who has"
1731,BOOK III.,wronged me; subdue him under my hand that in ages yet to come a
1732,BOOK III.,man may shrink from doing ill deeds in the house of his host.”
1733,BOOK III.,
1734,BOOK III.,"He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it at the shield of"
1735,BOOK III.,"Alexandrus. Through shield and cuirass it went, and tore the"
1736,BOOK III.,"shirt by his flank, but Alexandrus swerved aside, and thus saved"
1737,BOOK III.,"his life. Then the son of Atreus drew his sword, and drove at the"
1738,BOOK III.,"projecting part of his helmet, but the sword fell shivered in"
1739,BOOK III.,"three or four pieces from his hand, and he cried, looking towards"
1740,BOOK III.,"Heaven, “Father Jove, of all gods thou art the most despiteful; I"
1741,BOOK III.,"made sure of my revenge, but the sword has broken in my hand, my"
1742,BOOK III.,"spear has been hurled in vain, and I have not killed him.”"
1743,BOOK III.,
1744,BOOK III.,"With this he flew at Alexandrus, caught him by the horse-hair"
1745,BOOK III.,"plume of his helmet, and began dragging him towards the Achaeans."
1746,BOOK III.,"The strap of the helmet that went under his chin was choking him,"
1747,BOOK III.,and Menelaus would have dragged him off to his own great glory
1748,BOOK III.,had not Jove’s daughter Venus been quick to mark and to break the
1749,BOOK III.,"strap of ox-hide, so that the empty helmet came away in his hand."
1750,BOOK III.,"This he flung to his comrades among the Achaeans, and was again"
1751,BOOK III.,"springing upon Alexandrus to run him through with a spear, but"
1752,BOOK III.,"Venus snatched him up in a moment (as a god can do), hid him"
1753,BOOK III.,"under a cloud of darkness, and conveyed him to his own"
1754,BOOK III.,bedchamber.
1755,BOOK III.,
1756,BOOK III.,"Then she went to call Helen, and found her on a high tower with"
1757,BOOK III.,the Trojan women crowding round her. She took the form of an old
1758,BOOK III.,woman who used to dress wool for her when she was still in
1759,BOOK III.,"Lacedaemon, and of whom she was very fond. Thus disguised she"
1760,BOOK III.,"plucked her by perfumed robe and said, “Come hither; Alexandrus"
1761,BOOK III.,says you are to go to the house; he is on his bed in his own
1762,BOOK III.,"room, radiant with beauty and dressed in gorgeous apparel. No one"
1763,BOOK III.,"would think he had just come from fighting, but rather that he"
1764,BOOK III.,"was going to a dance, or had done dancing and was sitting down.”"
1765,BOOK III.,
1766,BOOK III.,With these words she moved the heart of Helen to anger. When she
1767,BOOK III.,"marked the beautiful neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and"
1768,BOOK III.,"sparkling eyes, she marvelled at her and said, “Goddess, why do"
1769,BOOK III.,you thus beguile me? Are you going to send me afield still
1770,BOOK III.,further to some man whom you have taken up in Phrygia or fair
1771,BOOK III.,"Meonia? Menelaus has just vanquished Alexandrus, and is to take"
1772,BOOK III.,my hateful self back with him. You are come here to betray me. Go
1773,BOOK III.,sit with Alexandrus yourself; henceforth be goddess no longer;
1774,BOOK III.,never let your feet carry you back to Olympus; worry about him
1775,BOOK III.,"and look after him till he make you his wife, or, for the matter"
1776,BOOK III.,"of that, his slave—but me? I shall not go; I can garnish his bed"
1777,BOOK III.,no longer; I should be a by-word among all the women of Troy.
1778,BOOK III.,"Besides, I have trouble on my mind.”"
1779,BOOK III.,
1780,BOOK III.,"Venus was very angry, and said, “Bold hussy, do not provoke me;"
1781,BOOK III.,"if you do, I shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as"
1782,BOOK III.,I have loved you. I will stir up fierce hatred between Trojans
1783,BOOK III.,"and Achaeans, and you shall come to a bad end.”"
1784,BOOK III.,
1785,BOOK III.,At this Helen was frightened. She wrapped her mantle about her
1786,BOOK III.,"and went in silence, following the goddess and unnoticed by the"
1787,BOOK III.,Trojan women.
1788,BOOK III.,
1789,BOOK III.,When they came to the house of Alexandrus the maid-servants set
1790,BOOK III.,"about their work, but Helen went into her own room, and the"
1791,BOOK III.,laughter-loving goddess took a seat and set it for her facing
1792,BOOK III.,"Alexandrus. On this Helen, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, sat"
1793,BOOK III.,"down, and with eyes askance began to upbraid her husband."
1794,BOOK III.,
1795,BOOK III.,"“So you are come from the fight,” said she; “would that you had"
1796,BOOK III.,fallen rather by the hand of that brave man who was my husband.
1797,BOOK III.,You used to brag that you were a better man with hands and spear
1798,BOOK III.,"than Menelaus. Go, then, and challenge him again—but I should"
1799,BOOK III.,"advise you not to do so, for if you are foolish enough to meet"
1800,BOOK III.,"him in single combat, you will soon fall by his spear.”"
1801,BOOK III.,
1802,BOOK III.,"And Paris answered, “Wife, do not vex me with your reproaches."
1803,BOOK III.,"This time, with the help of Minerva, Menelaus has vanquished me;"
1804,BOOK III.,"another time I may myself be victor, for I too have gods that"
1805,BOOK III.,"will stand by me. Come, let us lie down together and make"
1806,BOOK III.,friends. Never yet was I so passionately enamoured of you as at
1807,BOOK III.,this moment—not even when I first carried you off from Lacedaemon
1808,BOOK III.,and sailed away with you—not even when I had converse with you
1809,BOOK III.,upon the couch of love in the island of Cranae was I so
1810,BOOK III.,enthralled by desire of you as now.” On this he led her towards
1811,BOOK III.,"the bed, and his wife went with him."
1812,BOOK III.,
1813,BOOK III.,Thus they laid themselves on the bed together; but the son of
1814,BOOK III.,"Atreus strode among the throng, looking everywhere for"
1815,BOOK III.,"Alexandrus, and no man, neither of the Trojans nor of the allies,"
1816,BOOK III.,could find him. If they had seen him they were in no mind to hide
1817,BOOK III.,"him, for they all of them hated him as they did death itself."
1818,BOOK III.,"Then Agamemnon, king of men, spoke, saying, “Hear me, Trojans,"
1819,BOOK III.,"Dardanians, and allies. The victory has been with Menelaus;"
1820,BOOK III.,"therefore give back Helen with all her wealth, and pay such fine"
1821,BOOK III.,"as shall be agreed upon, in testimony among them that shall be"
1822,BOOK III.,born hereafter.”
1823,BOOK III.,
1824,BOOK III.,"Thus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans shouted in"
1825,BOOK III.,applause.
1826,BOOK III.,
1827,BOOK III.,
1828,BOOK III.,
1829,BOOK III.,
1830,BOOK IV.,BOOK IV.
1831,BOOK IV.,
1832,BOOK IV.,
1833,BOOK IV.,A quarrel in Olympus—Minerva goes down and persuades Fandarus to
1834,BOOK IV.,violate the oaths by wounding Menelaus with an arrow—Agamemnon
1835,BOOK IV.,makes a speech and sends for Machaon—He then goes about among his
1836,BOOK IV.,"captains and upbraids Ulysses and Sthenelus, who each of them"
1837,BOOK IV.,"retort fiercely—Diomed checks Sthenelus, and the two hosts then"
1838,BOOK IV.,"engage, with great slaughter on either side."
1839,BOOK IV.,
1840,BOOK IV.,Now the gods were sitting with Jove in council upon the golden
1841,BOOK IV.,"floor while Hebe went round pouring out nectar for them to drink,"
1842,BOOK IV.,and as they pledged one another in their cups of gold they looked
1843,BOOK IV.,down upon the town of Troy. The son of Saturn then began to tease
1844,BOOK IV.,"Juno, talking at her so as to provoke her. “Menelaus,” said he,"
1845,BOOK IV.,"“has two good friends among the goddesses, Juno of Argos, and"
1846,BOOK IV.,"Minerva of Alalcomene, but they only sit still and look on, while"
1847,BOOK IV.,Venus keeps ever by Alexandrus’ side to defend him in any danger;
1848,BOOK IV.,indeed she has just rescued him when he made sure that it was all
1849,BOOK IV.,over with him—for the victory really did lie with Menelaus. We
1850,BOOK IV.,must consider what we shall do about all this; shall we set them
1851,BOOK IV.,fighting anew or make peace between them? If you will agree to
1852,BOOK IV.,this last Menelaus can take back Helen and the city of Priam may
1853,BOOK IV.,remain still inhabited.”
1854,BOOK IV.,
1855,BOOK IV.,Minerva and Juno muttered their discontent as they sat side by
1856,BOOK IV.,side hatching mischief for the Trojans. Minerva scowled at her
1857,BOOK IV.,"father, for she was in a furious passion with him, and said"
1858,BOOK IV.,"nothing, but Juno could not contain herself. “Dread son of"
1859,BOOK IV.,"Saturn,” said she, “what, pray, is the meaning of all this? Is my"
1860,BOOK IV.,"trouble, then, to go for nothing, and the sweat that I have"
1861,BOOK IV.,"sweated, to say nothing of my horses, while getting the people"
1862,BOOK IV.,"together against Priam and his children? Do as you will, but we"
1863,BOOK IV.,other gods shall not all of us approve your counsel.”
1864,BOOK IV.,
1865,BOOK IV.,"Jove was angry and answered, “My dear, what harm have Priam and"
1866,BOOK IV.,his sons done you that you are so hotly bent on sacking the city
1867,BOOK IV.,of Ilius? Will nothing do for you but you must go within their walls
1868,BOOK IV.,"and eat Priam raw, with his sons and all the other Trojans to"
1869,BOOK IV.,boot? Have it your own way then; for I would not have this matter
1870,BOOK IV.,"become a bone of contention between us. I say further, and lay my"
1871,BOOK IV.,"saying to your heart, if ever I want to sack a city belonging to"
1872,BOOK IV.,"friends of yours, you must not try to stop me; you will have to"
1873,BOOK IV.,"let me do it, for I am giving in to you sorely against my will."
1874,BOOK IV.,"Of all inhabited cities under the sun and stars of heaven, there"
1875,BOOK IV.,was none that I so much respected as Ilius with Priam and his
1876,BOOK IV.,"whole people. Equitable feasts were never wanting about my altar,"
1877,BOOK IV.,"nor the savour of burning fat, which is honour due to ourselves.”"
1878,BOOK IV.,
1879,BOOK IV.,"“My own three favourite cities,” answered Juno, “are Argos,"
1880,BOOK IV.,"Sparta, and Mycenae. Sack them whenever you may be displeased"
1881,BOOK IV.,with them. I shall not defend them and I shall not care. Even if
1882,BOOK IV.,"I did, and tried to stay you, I should take nothing by it, for"
1883,BOOK IV.,"you are much stronger than I am, but I will not have my own work"
1884,BOOK IV.,wasted. I too am a god and of the same race with yourself. I am
1885,BOOK IV.,"Saturn’s eldest daughter, and am honourable not on this ground"
1886,BOOK IV.,"only, but also because I am your wife, and you are king over the"
1887,BOOK IV.,"gods. Let it be a case, then, of give-and-take between us, and"
1888,BOOK IV.,the rest of the gods will follow our lead. Tell Minerva to go and
1889,BOOK IV.,"take part in the fight at once, and let her contrive that the"
1890,BOOK IV.,Trojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the
1891,BOOK IV.,Achaeans.”
1892,BOOK IV.,
1893,BOOK IV.,"The sire of gods and men heeded her words, and said to Minerva,"
1894,BOOK IV.,"“Go at once into the Trojan and Achaean hosts, and contrive that"
1895,BOOK IV.,the Trojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon
1896,BOOK IV.,the Achaeans.”
1897,BOOK IV.,
1898,BOOK IV.,"This was what Minerva was already eager to do, so down she darted"
1899,BOOK IV.,from the topmost summits of Olympus. She shot through the sky as
1900,BOOK IV.,some brilliant meteor which the son of scheming Saturn has sent
1901,BOOK IV.,"as a sign to mariners or to some great army, and a fiery train of"
1902,BOOK IV.,light follows in its wake. The Trojans and Achaeans were struck
1903,BOOK IV.,"with awe as they beheld, and one would turn to his neighbour,"
1904,BOOK IV.,"saying, “Either we shall again have war and din of combat, or"
1905,BOOK IV.,Jove the lord of battle will now make peace between us.”
1906,BOOK IV.,
1907,BOOK IV.,"Thus did they converse. Then Minerva took the form of Laodocus,"
1908,BOOK IV.,"son of Antenor, and went through the ranks of the Trojans to find"
1909,BOOK IV.,"Pandarus, the redoubtable son of Lycaon. She found him standing"
1910,BOOK IV.,among the stalwart heroes who had followed him from the banks of
1911,BOOK IV.,"the Aesopus, so she went close up to him and said, “Brave son of"
1912,BOOK IV.,"Lycaon, will you do as I tell you? If you dare send an arrow at"
1913,BOOK IV.,"Menelaus you will win honour and thanks from all the Trojans, and"
1914,BOOK IV.,especially from prince Alexandrus—he would be the first to
1915,BOOK IV.,requite you very handsomely if he could see Menelaus mount his
1916,BOOK IV.,"funeral pyre, slain by an arrow from your hand. Take your home"
1917,BOOK IV.,"aim then, and pray to Lycian Apollo, the famous archer; vow that"
1918,BOOK IV.,when you get home to your strong city of Zelea you will offer a
1919,BOOK IV.,hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour.”
1920,BOOK IV.,
1921,BOOK IV.,"His fool’s heart was persuaded, and he took his bow from its"
1922,BOOK IV.,case. This bow was made from the horns of a wild ibex which he
1923,BOOK IV.,"had killed as it was bounding from a rock; he had stalked it, and"
1924,BOOK IV.,it had fallen as the arrow struck it to the heart. Its horns were
1925,BOOK IV.,"sixteen palms long, and a worker in horn had made them into a"
1926,BOOK IV.,"bow, smoothing them well down, and giving them tips of gold. When"
1927,BOOK IV.,"Pandarus had strung his bow he laid it carefully on the ground,"
1928,BOOK IV.,and his brave followers held their shields before him lest the
1929,BOOK IV.,Achaeans should set upon him before he had shot Menelaus. Then he
1930,BOOK IV.,opened the lid of his quiver and took out a winged arrow that had
1931,BOOK IV.,"not yet been shot, fraught with the pangs of death. He laid the"
1932,BOOK IV.,"arrow on the string and prayed to Lycian Apollo, the famous"
1933,BOOK IV.,"archer, vowing that when he got home to his strong city of Zelea"
1934,BOOK IV.,he would offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour. He
1935,BOOK IV.,"laid the notch of the arrow on the ox-hide bowstring, and drew"
1936,BOOK IV.,both notch and string to his breast till the arrow-head was near
1937,BOOK IV.,the bow; then when the bow was arched into a half-circle he let
1938,BOOK IV.,"fly, and the bow twanged, and the string sang as the arrow flew"
1939,BOOK IV.,gladly on over the heads of the throng.
1940,BOOK IV.,
1941,BOOK IV.,"But the blessed gods did not forget thee, O Menelaus, and Jove’s"
1942,BOOK IV.,"daughter, driver of the spoil, was the first to stand before thee"
1943,BOOK IV.,and ward off the piercing arrow. She turned it from his skin as a
1944,BOOK IV.,mother whisks a fly from off her child when it is sleeping
1945,BOOK IV.,sweetly; she guided it to the part where the golden buckles of
1946,BOOK IV.,"the belt that passed over his double cuirass were fastened, so"
1947,BOOK IV.,the arrow struck the belt that went tightly round him. It went
1948,BOOK IV.,right through this and through the cuirass of cunning
1949,BOOK IV.,"workmanship; it also pierced the belt beneath it, which he wore"
1950,BOOK IV.,next his skin to keep out darts or arrows; it was this that
1951,BOOK IV.,"served him in the best stead, nevertheless the arrow went through"
1952,BOOK IV.,"it and grazed the top of the skin, so that blood began flowing"
1953,BOOK IV.,from the wound.
1954,BOOK IV.,
1955,BOOK IV.,As when some woman of Meonia or Caria strains purple dye on to a
1956,BOOK IV.,"piece of ivory that is to be the cheek-piece of a horse, and is"
1957,BOOK IV.,to be laid up in a treasure house—many a knight is fain to bear
1958,BOOK IV.,"it, but the king keeps it as an ornament of which both horse and"
1959,BOOK IV.,"driver may be proud—even so, O Menelaus, were your shapely thighs"
1960,BOOK IV.,and your legs down to your fair ancles stained with blood.
1961,BOOK IV.,
1962,BOOK IV.,When King Agamemnon saw the blood flowing from the wound he was
1963,BOOK IV.,"afraid, and so was brave Menelaus himself till he saw that the"
1964,BOOK IV.,barbs of the arrow and the thread that bound the arrow-head to
1965,BOOK IV.,"the shaft were still outside the wound. Then he took heart, but"
1966,BOOK IV.,Agamemnon heaved a deep sigh as he held Menelaus’s hand in his
1967,BOOK IV.,"own, and his comrades made moan in concert. “Dear brother,” he"
1968,BOOK IV.,"cried, “I have been the death of you in pledging this covenant"
1969,BOOK IV.,and letting you come forward as our champion. The Trojans have
1970,BOOK IV.,trampled on their oaths and have wounded you; nevertheless the
1971,BOOK IV.,"oath, the blood of lambs, the drink-offerings and the right hands"
1972,BOOK IV.,of fellowship in which we have put our trust shall not be vain.
1973,BOOK IV.,"If he that rules Olympus fulfil it not here and now, he will yet"
1974,BOOK IV.,"fulfil it hereafter, and they shall pay dearly with their lives"
1975,BOOK IV.,and with their wives and children. The day will surely come when
1976,BOOK IV.,"mighty Ilius shall be laid low, with Priam and Priam’s people,"
1977,BOOK IV.,when the son of Saturn from his high throne shall overshadow them
1978,BOOK IV.,with his awful aegis in punishment of their present treachery.
1979,BOOK IV.,"This shall surely be; but how, Menelaus, shall I mourn you, if it"
1980,BOOK IV.,"be your lot now to die? I should return to Argos as a by-word,"
1981,BOOK IV.,for the Achaeans will at once go home. We shall leave Priam and
1982,BOOK IV.,"the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, and the earth will"
1983,BOOK IV.,rot your bones as you lie here at Troy with your purpose not
1984,BOOK IV.,fulfilled. Then shall some braggart Trojan leap upon your tomb
1985,BOOK IV.,"and say, ‘Ever thus may Agamemnon wreak his vengeance; he brought"
1986,BOOK IV.,his army in vain; he is gone home to his own land with empty
1987,BOOK IV.,"ships, and has left Menelaus behind him.’ Thus will one of them"
1988,BOOK IV.,"say, and may the earth then swallow me.”"
1989,BOOK IV.,
1990,BOOK IV.,"But Menelaus reassured him and said, “Take heart, and do not"
1991,BOOK IV.,"alarm the people; the arrow has not struck me in a mortal part,"
1992,BOOK IV.,"for my outer belt of burnished metal first stayed it, and under"
1993,BOOK IV.,this my cuirass and the belt of mail which the bronze-smiths made
1994,BOOK IV.,me.”
1995,BOOK IV.,
1996,BOOK IV.,"And Agamemnon answered, “I trust, dear Menelaus, that it may be"
1997,BOOK IV.,"even so, but the surgeon shall examine your wound and lay herbs"
1998,BOOK IV.,upon it to relieve your pain.”
1999,BOOK IV.,
2000,BOOK IV.,"He then said to Talthybius, “Talthybius, tell Machaon, son to the"
2001,BOOK IV.,"great physician, Aesculapius, to come and see Menelaus"
2002,BOOK IV.,immediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has wounded him with an
2003,BOOK IV.,"arrow to our dismay, and to his own great glory.”"
2004,BOOK IV.,
2005,BOOK IV.,"Talthybius did as he was told, and went about the host trying to"
2006,BOOK IV.,find Machaon. Presently he found standing amid the brave warriors
2007,BOOK IV.,who had followed him from Tricca; thereon he went up to him and
2008,BOOK IV.,"said, “Son of Aesculapius, King Agamemnon says you are to come"
2009,BOOK IV.,and see Menelaus immediately. Some Trojan or Lycian archer has
2010,BOOK IV.,wounded him with an arrow to our dismay and to his own great
2011,BOOK IV.,glory.”
2012,BOOK IV.,
2013,BOOK IV.,"Thus did he speak, and Machaon was moved to go. They passed"
2014,BOOK IV.,through the spreading host of the Achaeans and went on till they
2015,BOOK IV.,came to the place where Menelaus had been wounded and was lying
2016,BOOK IV.,with the chieftains gathered in a circle round him. Machaon
2017,BOOK IV.,passed into the middle of the ring and at once drew the arrow
2018,BOOK IV.,"from the belt, bending its barbs back through the force with"
2019,BOOK IV.,"which he pulled it out. He undid the burnished belt, and beneath"
2020,BOOK IV.,this the cuirass and the belt of mail which the bronze-smiths had
2021,BOOK IV.,"made; then, when he had seen the wound, he wiped away the blood"
2022,BOOK IV.,and applied some soothing drugs which Chiron had given to
2023,BOOK IV.,Aesculapius out of the good will he bore him.
2024,BOOK IV.,
2025,BOOK IV.,"While they were thus busy about Menelaus, the Trojans came"
2026,BOOK IV.,"forward against them, for they had put on their armour, and now"
2027,BOOK IV.,renewed the fight.
2028,BOOK IV.,
2029,BOOK IV.,You would not have then found Agamemnon asleep nor cowardly and
2030,BOOK IV.,"unwilling to fight, but eager rather for the fray. He left his"
2031,BOOK IV.,chariot rich with bronze and his panting steeds in charge of
2032,BOOK IV.,"Eurymedon, son of Ptolemaeus the son of Peiraeus, and bade him"
2033,BOOK IV.,hold them in readiness against the time his limbs should weary of
2034,BOOK IV.,"going about and giving orders to so many, for he went among the"
2035,BOOK IV.,ranks on foot. When he saw men hasting to the front he stood by
2036,BOOK IV.,"them and cheered them on. “Argives,” said he, “slacken not one"
2037,BOOK IV.,whit in your onset; father Jove will be no helper of liars; the
2038,BOOK IV.,Trojans have been the first to break their oaths and to attack
2039,BOOK IV.,us; therefore they shall be devoured of vultures; we shall take
2040,BOOK IV.,their city and carry off their wives and children in our ships.”
2041,BOOK IV.,
2042,BOOK IV.,But he angrily rebuked those whom he saw shirking and disinclined
2043,BOOK IV.,"to fight. “Argives,” he cried, “cowardly miserable creatures,"
2044,BOOK IV.,"have you no shame to stand here like frightened fawns who, when"
2045,BOOK IV.,"they can no longer scud over the plain, huddle together, but show"
2046,BOOK IV.,no fight? You are as dazed and spiritless as deer. Would you wait
2047,BOOK IV.,till the Trojans reach the sterns of our ships as they lie on the
2048,BOOK IV.,"shore, to see whether the son of Saturn will hold his hand over"
2049,BOOK IV.,you to protect you?”
2050,BOOK IV.,
2051,BOOK IV.,Thus did he go about giving his orders among the ranks. Passing
2052,BOOK IV.,"through the crowd, he came presently on the Cretans, arming round"
2053,BOOK IV.,"Idomeneus, who was at their head, fierce as a wild boar, while"
2054,BOOK IV.,Meriones was bringing up the battalions that were in the rear.
2055,BOOK IV.,"Agamemnon was glad when he saw him, and spoke him fairly."
2056,BOOK IV.,"“Idomeneus,” said he, “I treat you with greater distinction than"
2057,BOOK IV.,"I do any others of the Achaeans, whether in war or in other"
2058,BOOK IV.,"things, or at table. When the princes are mixing my choicest"
2059,BOOK IV.,"wines in the mixing-bowls, they have each of them a fixed"
2060,BOOK IV.,"allowance, but your cup is kept always full like my own, that you"
2061,BOOK IV.,"may drink whenever you are minded. Go, therefore, into battle,"
2062,BOOK IV.,and show yourself the man you have been always proud to be.”
2063,BOOK IV.,
2064,BOOK IV.,"Idomeneus answered, “I will be a trusty comrade, as I promised"
2065,BOOK IV.,"you from the first I would be. Urge on the other Achaeans, that"
2066,BOOK IV.,"we may join battle at once, for the Trojans have trampled upon"
2067,BOOK IV.,"their covenants. Death and destruction shall be theirs, seeing"
2068,BOOK IV.,they have been the first to break their oaths and to attack us.”
2069,BOOK IV.,
2070,BOOK IV.,"The son of Atreus went on, glad at heart, till he came upon the"
2071,BOOK IV.,two Ajaxes arming themselves amid a host of foot soldiers. As
2072,BOOK IV.,when a goat-herd from some high post watches a storm drive over
2073,BOOK IV.,the deep before the west wind—black as pitch is the offing and a
2074,BOOK IV.,"mighty whirlwind draws towards him, so that he is afraid and"
2075,BOOK IV.,drives his flock into a cave—even thus did the ranks of stalwart
2076,BOOK IV.,"youths move in a dark mass to battle under the Ajaxes, horrid"
2077,BOOK IV.,with shield and spear. Glad was King Agamemnon when he saw them.
2078,BOOK IV.,"“No need,” he cried, “to give orders to such leaders of the"
2079,BOOK IV.,"Argives as you are, for of your own selves you spur your men on"
2080,BOOK IV.,"to fight with might and main. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and"
2081,BOOK IV.,"Apollo that all were so minded as you are, for the city of Priam"
2082,BOOK IV.,"would then soon fall beneath our hands, and we should sack it.”"
2083,BOOK IV.,
2084,BOOK IV.,"With this he left them and went onward to Nestor, the facile"
2085,BOOK IV.,"speaker of the Pylians, who was marshalling his men and urging"
2086,BOOK IV.,"them on, in company with Pelagon, Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, and"
2087,BOOK IV.,Bias shepherd of his people. He placed his knights with their
2088,BOOK IV.,"chariots and horses in the front rank, while the foot soldiers,"
2089,BOOK IV.,"brave men and many, whom he could trust, were in the rear. The"
2090,BOOK IV.,"cowards he drove into the middle, that they might fight whether"
2091,BOOK IV.,"they would or no. He gave his orders to the knights first,"
2092,BOOK IV.,"bidding them hold their horses well in hand, so as to avoid"
2093,BOOK IV.,"confusion. “Let no man,” he said, “relying on his strength or"
2094,BOOK IV.,"horsemanship, get before the others and engage singly with the"
2095,BOOK IV.,"Trojans, nor yet let him lag behind or you will weaken your"
2096,BOOK IV.,attack; but let each when he meets an enemy’s chariot throw his
2097,BOOK IV.,spear from his own; this be much the best; this is how the men of
2098,BOOK IV.,old took towns and strongholds; in this wise were they minded.”
2099,BOOK IV.,
2100,BOOK IV.,"Thus did the old man charge them, for he had been in many a"
2101,BOOK IV.,"fight, and King Agamemnon was glad. “I wish,” he said to him,"
2102,BOOK IV.,“that your limbs were as supple and your strength as sure as your
2103,BOOK IV.,"judgment is; but age, the common enemy of mankind, has laid his"
2104,BOOK IV.,"hand upon you; would that it had fallen upon some other, and that"
2105,BOOK IV.,you were still young.”
2106,BOOK IV.,
2107,BOOK IV.,"And Nestor, knight of Gerene, answered, “Son of Atreus, I too"
2108,BOOK IV.,would gladly be the man I was when I slew mighty Ereuthalion; but
2109,BOOK IV.,the gods will not give us everything at one and the same time. I
2110,BOOK IV.,"was then young, and now I am old; still I can go with my knights"
2111,BOOK IV.,and give them that counsel which old men have a right to give.
2112,BOOK IV.,The wielding of the spear I leave to those who are younger and
2113,BOOK IV.,stronger than myself.”
2114,BOOK IV.,
2115,BOOK IV.,"Agamemnon went his way rejoicing, and presently found Menestheus,"
2116,BOOK IV.,"son of Peteos, tarrying in his place, and with him were the"
2117,BOOK IV.,Athenians loud of tongue in battle. Near him also tarried cunning
2118,BOOK IV.,"Ulysses, with his sturdy Cephallenians round him; they had not"
2119,BOOK IV.,"yet heard the battle-cry, for the ranks of Trojans and Achaeans"
2120,BOOK IV.,"had only just begun to move, so they were standing still, waiting"
2121,BOOK IV.,for some other columns of the Achaeans to attack the Trojans and
2122,BOOK IV.,begin the fighting. When he saw this Agamemnon rebuked them and
2123,BOOK IV.,"said, “Son of Peteos, and you other, steeped in cunning, heart of"
2124,BOOK IV.,"guile, why stand you here cowering and waiting on others? You two"
2125,BOOK IV.,should be of all men foremost when there is hard fighting to be
2126,BOOK IV.,"done, for you are ever foremost to accept my invitation when we"
2127,BOOK IV.,councillors of the Achaeans are holding feast. You are glad
2128,BOOK IV.,enough then to take your fill of roast meats and to drink wine as
2129,BOOK IV.,"long as you please, whereas now you would not care though you saw"
2130,BOOK IV.,ten columns of Achaeans engage the enemy in front of you.”
2131,BOOK IV.,
2132,BOOK IV.,"Ulysses glared at him and answered, “Son of Atreus, what are you"
2133,BOOK IV.,talking about? How can you say that we are slack? When the
2134,BOOK IV.,"Achaeans are in full fight with the Trojans, you shall see, if"
2135,BOOK IV.,"you care to do so, that the father of Telemachus will join battle"
2136,BOOK IV.,with the foremost of them. You are talking idly.”
2137,BOOK IV.,
2138,BOOK IV.,"When Agamemnon saw that Ulysses was angry, he smiled pleasantly"
2139,BOOK IV.,"at him and withdrew his words. “Ulysses,” said he, “noble son of"
2140,BOOK IV.,"Laertes, excellent in all good counsel, I have neither fault to"
2141,BOOK IV.,"find nor orders to give you, for I know your heart is right, and"
2142,BOOK IV.,that you and I are of a mind. Enough; I will make you amends for
2143,BOOK IV.,"what I have said, and if any ill has now been spoken may the gods"
2144,BOOK IV.,bring it to nothing.”
2145,BOOK IV.,
2146,BOOK IV.,He then left them and went on to others. Presently he saw the son
2147,BOOK IV.,"of Tydeus, noble Diomed, standing by his chariot and horses, with"
2148,BOOK IV.,Sthenelus the son of Capaneus beside him; whereon he began to
2149,BOOK IV.,"upbraid him. “Son of Tydeus,” he said, “why stand you cowering"
2150,BOOK IV.,"here upon the brink of battle? Tydeus did not shrink thus, but"
2151,BOOK IV.,was ever ahead of his men when leading them on against the
2152,BOOK IV.,"foe—so, at least, say they that saw him in battle, for I never"
2153,BOOK IV.,set eyes upon him myself. They say that there was no man like
2154,BOOK IV.,"him. He came once to Mycenae, not as an enemy but as a guest, in"
2155,BOOK IV.,"company with Polynices to recruit his forces, for they were"
2156,BOOK IV.,"levying war against the strong city of Thebes, and prayed our"
2157,BOOK IV.,people for a body of picked men to help them. The men of Mycenae
2158,BOOK IV.,"were willing to let them have one, but Jove dissuaded them by"
2159,BOOK IV.,"showing them unfavourable omens. Tydeus, therefore, and Polynices"
2160,BOOK IV.,went their way. When they had got as far the deep-meadowed and
2161,BOOK IV.,"rush-grown banks of the Aesopus, the Achaeans sent Tydeus as"
2162,BOOK IV.,"their envoy, and he found the Cadmeans gathered in great numbers"
2163,BOOK IV.,"to a banquet in the house of Eteocles. Stranger though he was, he"
2164,BOOK IV.,"knew no fear on finding himself single-handed among so many, but"
2165,BOOK IV.,"challenged them to contests of all kinds, and in each one of them"
2166,BOOK IV.,"was at once victorious, so mightily did Minerva help him. The"
2167,BOOK IV.,"Cadmeans were incensed at his success, and set a force of fifty"
2168,BOOK IV.,"youths with two captains—the godlike hero Maeon, son of Haemon,"
2169,BOOK IV.,"and Polyphontes, son of Autophonus—at their head, to lie in wait"
2170,BOOK IV.,"for him on his return journey; but Tydeus slew every man of them,"
2171,BOOK IV.,"save only Maeon, whom he let go in obedience to heaven’s omens."
2172,BOOK IV.,"Such was Tydeus of Aetolia. His son can talk more glibly, but he"
2173,BOOK IV.,cannot fight as his father did.”
2174,BOOK IV.,
2175,BOOK IV.,"Diomed made no answer, for he was shamed by the rebuke of"
2176,BOOK IV.,"Agamemnon; but the son of Capaneus took up his words and said,"
2177,BOOK IV.,"“Son of Atreus, tell no lies, for you can speak truth if you"
2178,BOOK IV.,will. We boast ourselves as even better men than our fathers; we
2179,BOOK IV.,"took seven-gated Thebes, though the wall was stronger and our men"
2180,BOOK IV.,"were fewer in number, for we trusted in the omens of the gods and"
2181,BOOK IV.,"in the help of Jove, whereas they perished through their own"
2182,BOOK IV.,"sheer folly; hold not, then, our fathers in like honour with us.”"
2183,BOOK IV.,
2184,BOOK IV.,"Diomed looked sternly at him and said, “Hold your peace, my"
2185,BOOK IV.,"friend, as I bid you. It is not amiss that Agamemnon should urge"
2186,BOOK IV.,"the Achaeans forward, for the glory will be his if we take the"
2187,BOOK IV.,"city, and his the shame if we are vanquished. Therefore let us"
2188,BOOK IV.,acquit ourselves with valour.”
2189,BOOK IV.,
2190,BOOK IV.,"As he spoke he sprang from his chariot, and his armour rang so"
2191,BOOK IV.,fiercely about his body that even a brave man might well have
2192,BOOK IV.,been scared to hear it.
2193,BOOK IV.,
2194,BOOK IV.,As when some mighty wave that thunders on the beach when the west
2195,BOOK IV.,wind has lashed it into fury—it has reared its head afar and now
2196,BOOK IV.,comes crashing down on the shore; it bows its arching crest high
2197,BOOK IV.,over the jagged rocks and spews its salt foam in all
2198,BOOK IV.,directions—even so did the serried phalanxes of the Danaans march
2199,BOOK IV.,steadfastly to battle. The chiefs gave orders each to his own
2200,BOOK IV.,"people, but the men said never a word; no man would think it, for"
2201,BOOK IV.,"huge as the host was, it seemed as though there was not a tongue"
2202,BOOK IV.,"among them, so silent were they in their obedience; and as they"
2203,BOOK IV.,marched the armour about their bodies glistened in the sun. But
2204,BOOK IV.,the clamour of the Trojan ranks was as that of many thousand ewes
2205,BOOK IV.,that stand waiting to be milked in the yards of some rich
2206,BOOK IV.,"flock-master, and bleat incessantly in answer to the bleating of"
2207,BOOK IV.,"their lambs; for they had not one speech nor language, but their"
2208,BOOK IV.,"tongues were diverse, and they came from many different places."
2209,BOOK IV.,"These were inspired of Mars, but the others by Minerva—and with"
2210,BOOK IV.,"them came Panic, Rout, and Strife whose fury never tires, sister"
2211,BOOK IV.,"and friend of murderous Mars, who, from being at first but low in"
2212,BOOK IV.,"stature, grows till she uprears her head to heaven, though her"
2213,BOOK IV.,feet are still on earth. She it was that went about among them
2214,BOOK IV.,and flung down discord to the waxing of sorrow with even hand
2215,BOOK IV.,between them.
2216,BOOK IV.,
2217,BOOK IV.,When they were got together in one place shield clashed with
2218,BOOK IV.,shield and spear with spear in the rage of battle. The bossed
2219,BOOK IV.,"shields beat one upon another, and there was a tramp as of a"
2220,BOOK IV.,great multitude—death-cry and shout of triumph of slain and
2221,BOOK IV.,"slayers, and the earth ran red with blood. As torrents swollen"
2222,BOOK IV.,with rain course madly down their deep channels till the angry
2223,BOOK IV.,"floods meet in some gorge, and the shepherd on the hillside hears"
2224,BOOK IV.,their roaring from afar—even such was the toil and uproar of the
2225,BOOK IV.,hosts as they joined in battle.
2226,BOOK IV.,
2227,BOOK IV.,"First Antilochus slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Echepolus,"
2228,BOOK IV.,"son of Thalysius, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck at"
2229,BOOK IV.,the projecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his
2230,BOOK IV.,"brow; the point of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled"
2231,BOOK IV.,his eyes; headlong as a tower he fell amid the press of the
2232,BOOK IV.,"fight, and as he dropped King Elephenor, son of Chalcodon and"
2233,BOOK IV.,captain of the proud Abantes began dragging him out of reach of
2234,BOOK IV.,"the darts that were falling around him, in haste to strip him of"
2235,BOOK IV.,his armour. But his purpose was not for long; Agenor saw him
2236,BOOK IV.,"haling the body away, and smote him in the side with his"
2237,BOOK IV.,bronze-shod spear—for as he stooped his side was left unprotected
2238,BOOK IV.,by his shield—and thus he perished. Then the fight between
2239,BOOK IV.,"Trojans and Achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flew"
2240,BOOK IV.,"upon each other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the"
2241,BOOK IV.,other.
2242,BOOK IV.,
2243,BOOK IV.,"Forthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair youth Simoeisius,"
2244,BOOK IV.,"son of Anthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the"
2245,BOOK IV.,"Simois, as she was coming down from Mt. Ida, where she had been"
2246,BOOK IV.,with her parents to see their flocks. Therefore he was named
2247,BOOK IV.,"Simoeisius, but he did not live to pay his parents for his"
2248,BOOK IV.,"rearing, for he was cut off untimely by the spear of mighty Ajax,"
2249,BOOK IV.,who struck him in the breast by the right nipple as he was coming
2250,BOOK IV.,on among the foremost fighters; the spear went right through his
2251,BOOK IV.,"shoulder, and he fell as a poplar that has grown straight and"
2252,BOOK IV.,"tall in a meadow by some mere, and its top is thick with"
2253,BOOK IV.,branches. Then the wheelwright lays his axe to its roots that he
2254,BOOK IV.,"may fashion a felloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and it"
2255,BOOK IV.,lies seasoning by the waterside. In such wise did Ajax fell to
2256,BOOK IV.,"earth Simoeisius, son of Anthemion. Thereon Antiphus of the"
2257,BOOK IV.,"gleaming corslet, son of Priam, hurled a spear at Ajax from amid"
2258,BOOK IV.,"the crowd and missed him, but he hit Leucus, the brave comrade of"
2259,BOOK IV.,"Ulysses, in the groin, as he was dragging the body of Simoeisius"
2260,BOOK IV.,over to the other side; so he fell upon the body and loosed his
2261,BOOK IV.,"hold upon it. Ulysses was furious when he saw Leucus slain, and"
2262,BOOK IV.,strode in full armour through the front ranks till he was quite
2263,BOOK IV.,"close; then he glared round about him and took aim, and the"
2264,BOOK IV.,"Trojans fell back as he did so. His dart was not sped in vain,"
2265,BOOK IV.,"for it struck Democoon, the bastard son of Priam, who had come to"
2266,BOOK IV.,"him from Abydos, where he had charge of his father’s mares."
2267,BOOK IV.,"Ulysses, infuriated by the death of his comrade, hit him with his"
2268,BOOK IV.,"spear on one temple, and the bronze point came through on the"
2269,BOOK IV.,"other side of his forehead. Thereon darkness veiled his eyes, and"
2270,BOOK IV.,his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the
2271,BOOK IV.,"ground. Hector, and they that were in front, then gave round"
2272,BOOK IV.,"while the Argives raised a shout and drew off the dead, pressing"
2273,BOOK IV.,further forward as they did so. But Apollo looked down from
2274,BOOK IV.,"Pergamus and called aloud to the Trojans, for he was displeased."
2275,BOOK IV.,"“Trojans,” he cried, “rush on the foe, and do not let yourselves"
2276,BOOK IV.,be thus beaten by the Argives. Their skins are not stone nor iron
2277,BOOK IV.,"that when you hit them you do them no harm. Moreover, Achilles, the"
2278,BOOK IV.,"son of lovely Thetis, is not fighting, but is nursing his anger"
2279,BOOK IV.,at the ships.”
2280,BOOK IV.,
2281,BOOK IV.,"Thus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from the city, while"
2282,BOOK IV.,"Jove’s redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, went about among the"
2283,BOOK IV.,"host of the Achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld"
2284,BOOK IV.,them slackening.
2285,BOOK IV.,
2286,BOOK IV.,"Then fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynceus, for he was struck"
2287,BOOK IV.,by a jagged stone near the ancle of his right leg. He that hurled
2288,BOOK IV.,"it was Peirous, son of Imbrasus, captain of the Thracians, who"
2289,BOOK IV.,had come from Aenus; the bones and both the tendons were crushed
2290,BOOK IV.,"by the pitiless stone. He fell to the ground on his back, and in"
2291,BOOK IV.,his death-throes stretched out his hands towards his comrades.
2292,BOOK IV.,"But Peirous, who had wounded him, sprang on him and thrust a"
2293,BOOK IV.,"spear into his belly, so that his bowels came gushing out upon"
2294,BOOK IV.,"the ground, and darkness veiled his eyes. As he was leaving the"
2295,BOOK IV.,"body, Thoas of Aetolia struck him in the chest near the nipple,"
2296,BOOK IV.,and the point fixed itself in his lungs. Thoas came close up to
2297,BOOK IV.,"him, pulled the spear out of his chest, and then drawing his"
2298,BOOK IV.,"sword, smote him in the middle of the belly so that he died; but"
2299,BOOK IV.,"he did not strip him of his armour, for his Thracian comrades,"
2300,BOOK IV.,"men who wear their hair in a tuft at the top of their heads,"
2301,BOOK IV.,stood round the body and kept him off with their long spears for
2302,BOOK IV.,all his great stature and valour; so he was driven back. Thus the
2303,BOOK IV.,"two corpses lay stretched on earth near to one another, the one"
2304,BOOK IV.,captain of the Thracians and the other of the Epeans; and many
2305,BOOK IV.,another fell round them.
2306,BOOK IV.,
2307,BOOK IV.,And now no man would have made light of the fighting if he could
2308,BOOK IV.,"have gone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with Minerva"
2309,BOOK IV.,"leading him by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of"
2310,BOOK IV.,spears and arrows. For many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay
2311,BOOK IV.,stretched side by side face downwards upon the earth.
2312,BOOK IV.,
2313,BOOK IV.,
2314,BOOK IV.,
2315,BOOK IV.,
2316,BOOK V.,BOOK V.
2317,BOOK V.,
2318,BOOK V.,
2319,BOOK V.,"The exploits of Diomed, who, though wounded by Pandarus,"
2320,BOOK V.,continues fighting—He kills Pandarus and wounds AEneas—Venus
2321,BOOK V.,"rescues AEneas, but being wounded by Diomed, commits him to the"
2322,BOOK V.,"care of Apollo and goes to Olympus, where she is tended by her"
2323,BOOK V.,"mother Dione—Mars encourages the Trojans, and AEneas returns to"
2324,BOOK V.,"the fight cured of his wound—Minerva and Juno help the Achaeans,"
2325,BOOK V.,"and by the advice of the former Diomed wounds Mars, who returns"
2326,BOOK V.,to Olympus to get cured.
2327,BOOK V.,
2328,BOOK V.,"Then Pallas Minerva put valour into the heart of Diomed, son of"
2329,BOOK V.,"Tydeus, that he might excel all the other Argives, and cover"
2330,BOOK V.,himself with glory. She made a stream of fire flare from his
2331,BOOK V.,shield and helmet like the star that shines most brilliantly in
2332,BOOK V.,summer after its bath in the waters of Oceanus—even such a fire
2333,BOOK V.,did she kindle upon his head and shoulders as she bade him speed
2334,BOOK V.,into the thickest hurly-burly of the fight.
2335,BOOK V.,
2336,BOOK V.,Now there was a certain rich and honourable man among the
2337,BOOK V.,"Trojans, priest of Vulcan, and his name was Dares. He had two"
2338,BOOK V.,"sons, Phegeus and Idaeus, both of them skilled in all the arts of"
2339,BOOK V.,"war. These two came forward from the main body of Trojans, and"
2340,BOOK V.,"set upon Diomed, he being on foot, while they fought from their"
2341,BOOK V.,"chariot. When they were close up to one another, Phegeus took aim"
2342,BOOK V.,"first, but his spear went over Diomed’s left shoulder without"
2343,BOOK V.,"hitting him. Diomed then threw, and his spear sped not in vain,"
2344,BOOK V.,"for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the nipple, and he fell"
2345,BOOK V.,from his chariot. Idaeus did not dare to bestride his brother’s
2346,BOOK V.,"body, but sprang from the chariot and took to flight, or he would"
2347,BOOK V.,have shared his brother’s fate; whereon Vulcan saved him by
2348,BOOK V.,"wrapping him in a cloud of darkness, that his old father might"
2349,BOOK V.,not be utterly overwhelmed with grief; but the son of Tydeus
2350,BOOK V.,"drove off with the horses, and bade his followers take them to"
2351,BOOK V.,the ships. The Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons of
2352,BOOK V.,"Dares, one of them in fright and the other lying dead by his"
2353,BOOK V.,"chariot. Minerva, therefore, took Mars by the hand and said,"
2354,BOOK V.,"“Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities, may we"
2355,BOOK V.,"not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans to fight it out, and see"
2356,BOOK V.,to which of the two Jove will vouchsafe the victory? Let us go
2357,BOOK V.,"away, and thus avoid his anger.”"
2358,BOOK V.,
2359,BOOK V.,"So saying, she drew Mars out of the battle, and set him down upon"
2360,BOOK V.,the steep banks of the Scamander. Upon this the Danaans drove the
2361,BOOK V.,"Trojans back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man."
2362,BOOK V.,"First King Agamemnon flung mighty Odius, captain of the Halizoni,"
2363,BOOK V.,from his chariot. The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad
2364,BOOK V.,"of his back, just as he was turning in flight; it struck him"
2365,BOOK V.,"between the shoulders and went right through his chest, and his"
2366,BOOK V.,armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.
2367,BOOK V.,
2368,BOOK V.,"Then Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Borus the Meonian, who had"
2369,BOOK V.,come from Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right
2370,BOOK V.,"shoulder as he was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of"
2371,BOOK V.,death enshrouded him as he fell heavily from the car.
2372,BOOK V.,
2373,BOOK V.,"The squires of Idomeneus spoiled him of his armour, while"
2374,BOOK V.,"Menelaus, son of Atreus, killed Scamandrius the son of Strophius,"
2375,BOOK V.,a mighty huntsman and keen lover of the chase. Diana herself had
2376,BOOK V.,taught him how to kill every kind of wild creature that is bred
2377,BOOK V.,"in mountain forests, but neither she nor his famed skill in"
2378,BOOK V.,"archery could now save him, for the spear of Menelaus struck him"
2379,BOOK V.,in the back as he was flying; it struck him between the shoulders
2380,BOOK V.,"and went right through his chest, so that he fell headlong and"
2381,BOOK V.,his armour rang rattling round him.
2382,BOOK V.,
2383,BOOK V.,"Meriones then killed Phereclus the son of Tecton, who was the son"
2384,BOOK V.,"of Hermon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner of cunning"
2385,BOOK V.,"workmanship, for Pallas Minerva had dearly loved him. He it was"
2386,BOOK V.,"that made the ships for Alexandrus, which were the beginning of"
2387,BOOK V.,"all mischief, and brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on"
2388,BOOK V.,Alexandrus himself; for he heeded not the decrees of heaven.
2389,BOOK V.,"Meriones overtook him as he was flying, and struck him on the"
2390,BOOK V.,right buttock. The point of the spear went through the bone into
2391,BOOK V.,"the bladder, and death came upon him as he cried aloud and fell"
2392,BOOK V.,forward on his knees.
2393,BOOK V.,
2394,BOOK V.,"Meges, moreover, slew Pedaeus, son of Antenor, who, though he was"
2395,BOOK V.,"a bastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own"
2396,BOOK V.,"children, for the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus"
2397,BOOK V.,got close up to him and drove a spear into the nape of his neck:
2398,BOOK V.,"it went under his tongue all among his teeth, so he bit the cold"
2399,BOOK V.,"bronze, and fell dead in the dust."
2400,BOOK V.,
2401,BOOK V.,"And Eurypylus, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor, the son of noble"
2402,BOOK V.,"Dolopion, who had been made priest of the river Scamander, and"
2403,BOOK V.,was honoured among the people as though he were a god. Eurypylus
2404,BOOK V.,"gave him chase as he was flying before him, smote him with his"
2405,BOOK V.,"sword upon the arm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The"
2406,BOOK V.,"bloody hand fell to the ground, and the shades of death, with"
2407,BOOK V.,"fate that no man can withstand, came over his eyes."
2408,BOOK V.,
2409,BOOK V.,Thus furiously did the battle rage between them. As for the son
2410,BOOK V.,"of Tydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the"
2411,BOOK V.,Achaeans or the Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter
2412,BOOK V.,"torrent that has burst its barrier in full flood; no dykes, no"
2413,BOOK V.,walls of fruitful vineyards can embank it when it is swollen with
2414,BOOK V.,"rain from heaven, but in a moment it comes tearing onward, and"
2415,BOOK V.,lays many a field waste that many a strong man’s hand has
2416,BOOK V.,reclaimed—even so were the dense phalanxes of the Trojans driven
2417,BOOK V.,"in rout by the son of Tydeus, and many though they were, they"
2418,BOOK V.,dared not abide his onslaught.
2419,BOOK V.,
2420,BOOK V.,Now when the son of Lycaon saw him scouring the plain and driving
2421,BOOK V.,"the Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit the"
2422,BOOK V.,front part of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right
2423,BOOK V.,"through the metal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was"
2424,BOOK V.,"covered with blood. On this the son of Lycaon shouted in triumph,"
2425,BOOK V.,"“Knights Trojans, come on; the bravest of the Achaeans is"
2426,BOOK V.,"wounded, and he will not hold out much longer if King Apollo was"
2427,BOOK V.,indeed with me when I sped from Lycia hither.”
2428,BOOK V.,
2429,BOOK V.,"Thus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed Diomed, who"
2430,BOOK V.,"withdrew and made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelus, the"
2431,BOOK V.,"son of Capaneus. “Dear son of Capaneus,” said he, “come down from"
2432,BOOK V.,"your chariot, and draw the arrow out of my shoulder.”"
2433,BOOK V.,
2434,BOOK V.,"Sthenelus sprang from his chariot, and drew the arrow from the"
2435,BOOK V.,"wound, whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that"
2436,BOOK V.,"had been made in his shirt. Then Diomed prayed, saying, “Hear me,"
2437,BOOK V.,"daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, if ever you loved my"
2438,BOOK V.,"father well and stood by him in the thick of a fight, do the like"
2439,BOOK V.,now by me; grant me to come within a spear’s throw of that man
2440,BOOK V.,and kill him. He has been too quick for me and has wounded me;
2441,BOOK V.,and now he is boasting that I shall not see the light of the sun
2442,BOOK V.,much longer.”
2443,BOOK V.,
2444,BOOK V.,"Thus he prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard him; she made his limbs"
2445,BOOK V.,supple and quickened his hands and his feet. Then she went up
2446,BOOK V.,"close to him and said, “Fear not, Diomed, to do battle with the"
2447,BOOK V.,"Trojans, for I have set in your heart the spirit of your knightly"
2448,BOOK V.,"father Tydeus. Moreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your"
2449,BOOK V.,"eyes, that you know gods and men apart. If, then, any other god"
2450,BOOK V.,"comes here and offers you battle, do not fight him; but should"
2451,BOOK V.,"Jove’s daughter Venus come, strike her with your spear and wound"
2452,BOOK V.,her.”
2453,BOOK V.,
2454,BOOK V.,"When she had said this Minerva went away, and the son of Tydeus"
2455,BOOK V.,"again took his place among the foremost fighters, three times"
2456,BOOK V.,more fierce even than he had been before. He was like a lion that
2457,BOOK V.,"some mountain shepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is"
2458,BOOK V.,springing over the wall of a sheep-yard to attack the sheep. The
2459,BOOK V.,shepherd has roused the brute to fury but cannot defend his
2460,BOOK V.,"flock, so he takes shelter under cover of the buildings, while"
2461,BOOK V.,"the sheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, are smothered in"
2462,BOOK V.,"heaps one on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps out over"
2463,BOOK V.,the sheep-yard wall. Even thus did Diomed go furiously about
2464,BOOK V.,among the Trojans.
2465,BOOK V.,
2466,BOOK V.,"He killed Astynous, and Hypeiron shepherd of his people, the one"
2467,BOOK V.,"with a thrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple,"
2468,BOOK V.,"the other with a sword-cut on the collar-bone, that severed his"
2469,BOOK V.,"shoulder from his neck and back. He let both of them lie, and"
2470,BOOK V.,"went in pursuit of Abas and Polyidus, sons of the old reader of"
2471,BOOK V.,dreams Eurydamas: they never came back for him to read them any
2472,BOOK V.,"more dreams, for mighty Diomed made an end of them. He then gave"
2473,BOOK V.,"chase to Xanthus and Thoon, the two sons of Phaenops, both of"
2474,BOOK V.,"them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with age, and"
2475,BOOK V.,begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. But Diomed took
2476,BOOK V.,"both their lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for he"
2477,BOOK V.,"nevermore saw them come home from battle alive, and his kinsmen"
2478,BOOK V.,divided his wealth among themselves.
2479,BOOK V.,
2480,BOOK V.,"Then he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon and Chromius, as"
2481,BOOK V.,they were both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion
2482,BOOK V.,fastens on the neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is
2483,BOOK V.,feeding in a coppice. For all their vain struggles he flung them
2484,BOOK V.,both from their chariot and stripped the armour from their
2485,BOOK V.,bodies. Then he gave their horses to his comrades to take them
2486,BOOK V.,back to the ships.
2487,BOOK V.,
2488,BOOK V.,"When Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the ranks, he went"
2489,BOOK V.,through the fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could find
2490,BOOK V.,"Pandarus. When he had found the brave son of Lycaon he said,"
2491,BOOK V.,"“Pandarus, where is now your bow, your winged arrows, and your"
2492,BOOK V.,"renown as an archer, in respect of which no man here can rival"
2493,BOOK V.,you nor is there any in Lycia that can beat you? Lift then your
2494,BOOK V.,hands to Jove and send an arrow at this fellow who is going so
2495,BOOK V.,"masterfully about, and has done such deadly work among the"
2496,BOOK V.,Trojans. He has killed many a brave man—unless indeed he is some
2497,BOOK V.,"god who is angry with the Trojans about their sacrifices, and"
2498,BOOK V.,has set his hand against them in his displeasure.”
2499,BOOK V.,
2500,BOOK V.,"And the son of Lycaon answered, “Aeneas, I take him for none"
2501,BOOK V.,"other than the son of Tydeus. I know him by his shield, the visor"
2502,BOOK V.,"of his helmet, and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a"
2503,BOOK V.,"god, but if he is the man I say he is, he is not making all this"
2504,BOOK V.,"havoc without heaven’s help, but has some god by his side who is"
2505,BOOK V.,"shrouded in a cloud of darkness, and who turned my arrow aside"
2506,BOOK V.,when it had hit him. I have taken aim at him already and hit him
2507,BOOK V.,on the right shoulder; my arrow went through the breast-piece of
2508,BOOK V.,his cuirass; and I made sure I should send him hurrying to the
2509,BOOK V.,"world below, but it seems that I have not killed him. There must"
2510,BOOK V.,be a god who is angry with me. Moreover I have neither horse nor
2511,BOOK V.,chariot. In my father’s stables there are eleven excellent
2512,BOOK V.,"chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with cloths spread"
2513,BOOK V.,"over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses,"
2514,BOOK V.,champing barley and rye; my old father Lycaon urged me again and
2515,BOOK V.,"again when I was at home and on the point of starting, to take"
2516,BOOK V.,chariots and horses with me that I might lead the Trojans in
2517,BOOK V.,"battle, but I would not listen to him; it would have been much"
2518,BOOK V.,"better if I had done so, but I was thinking about the horses,"
2519,BOOK V.,"which had been used to eat their fill, and I was afraid that in"
2520,BOOK V.,"such a great gathering of men they might be ill-fed, so I left"
2521,BOOK V.,them at home and came on foot to Ilius armed only with my bow and
2522,BOOK V.,"arrows. These it seems, are of no use, for I have already hit two"
2523,BOOK V.,"chieftains, the sons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and though I drew"
2524,BOOK V.,"blood surely enough, I have only made them still more furious. I"
2525,BOOK V.,did ill to take my bow down from its peg on the day I led my band
2526,BOOK V.,"of Trojans to Ilius in Hector’s service, and if ever I get home"
2527,BOOK V.,"again to set eyes on my native place, my wife, and the greatness"
2528,BOOK V.,"of my house, may some one cut my head off then and there if I do"
2529,BOOK V.,not break the bow and set it on a hot fire—such pranks as it
2530,BOOK V.,plays me.”
2531,BOOK V.,
2532,BOOK V.,"Aeneas answered, “Say no more. Things will not mend till we two"
2533,BOOK V.,go against this man with chariot and horses and bring him to a
2534,BOOK V.,"trial of arms. Mount my chariot, and note how cleverly the horses"
2535,BOOK V.,of Tros can speed hither and thither over the plain in pursuit or
2536,BOOK V.,flight. If Jove again vouchsafes glory to the son of Tydeus they
2537,BOOK V.,"will carry us safely back to the city. Take hold, then, of the"
2538,BOOK V.,"whip and reins while I stand upon the car to fight, or else do"
2539,BOOK V.,you wait this man’s onset while I look after the horses.”
2540,BOOK V.,
2541,BOOK V.,"“Aeneas,” replied the son of Lycaon, “take the reins and drive;"
2542,BOOK V.,if we have to fly before the son of Tydeus the horses will go
2543,BOOK V.,better for their own driver. If they miss the sound of your voice
2544,BOOK V.,"when they expect it they may be frightened, and refuse to take us"
2545,BOOK V.,out of the fight. The son of Tydeus will then kill both of us and
2546,BOOK V.,take the horses. Therefore drive them yourself and I will be
2547,BOOK V.,ready for him with my spear.”
2548,BOOK V.,
2549,BOOK V.,They then mounted the chariot and drove full speed towards the
2550,BOOK V.,"son of Tydeus. Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, saw them coming and"
2551,BOOK V.,"said to Diomed, “Diomed, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, I"
2552,BOOK V.,"see two heroes speeding towards you, both of them men of might"
2553,BOOK V.,"the one a skilful archer, Pandarus son of Lycaon, the other,"
2554,BOOK V.,"Aeneas, whose sire is Anchises, while his mother is Venus. Mount"
2555,BOOK V.,"the chariot and let us retreat. Do not, I pray you, press so"
2556,BOOK V.,"furiously forward, or you may get killed.”"
2557,BOOK V.,
2558,BOOK V.,"Diomed looked angrily at him and answered: “Talk not of flight,"
2559,BOOK V.,for I shall not listen to you: I am of a race that knows neither
2560,BOOK V.,"flight nor fear, and my limbs are as yet unwearied. I am in no"
2561,BOOK V.,"mind to mount, but will go against them even as I am; Pallas"
2562,BOOK V.,"Minerva bids me be afraid of no man, and even though one of them"
2563,BOOK V.,"escape, their steeds shall not take both back again. I say"
2564,BOOK V.,"further, and lay my saying to your heart—if Minerva sees fit to"
2565,BOOK V.,"vouchsafe me the glory of killing both, stay your horses here and"
2566,BOOK V.,make the reins fast to the rim of the chariot; then be sure you
2567,BOOK V.,spring Aeneas’ horses and drive them from the Trojan to the
2568,BOOK V.,Achaean ranks. They are of the stock that great Jove gave to Tros
2569,BOOK V.,"in payment for his son Ganymede, and are the finest that live and"
2570,BOOK V.,move under the sun. King Anchises stole the blood by putting his
2571,BOOK V.,"mares to them without Laomedon’s knowledge, and they bore him six"
2572,BOOK V.,"foals. Four are still in his stables, but he gave the other two"
2573,BOOK V.,to Aeneas. We shall win great glory if we can take them.”
2574,BOOK V.,
2575,BOOK V.,"Thus did they converse, but the other two had now driven close up"
2576,BOOK V.,"to them, and the son of Lycaon spoke first. “Great and mighty"
2577,BOOK V.,"son,” said he, “of noble Tydeus, my arrow failed to lay you low,"
2578,BOOK V.,so I will now try with my spear.”
2579,BOOK V.,
2580,BOOK V.,He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it from him. It struck
2581,BOOK V.,the shield of the son of Tydeus; the bronze point pierced it and
2582,BOOK V.,passed on till it reached the breastplate. Thereon the son of
2583,BOOK V.,"Lycaon shouted out and said, “You are hit clean through the"
2584,BOOK V.,"belly; you will not stand out for long, and the glory of the"
2585,BOOK V.,fight is mine.”
2586,BOOK V.,
2587,BOOK V.,"But Diomed all undismayed made answer, “You have missed, not hit,"
2588,BOOK V.,and before you two see the end of this matter one or other of you
2589,BOOK V.,shall glut tough-shielded Mars with his blood.”
2590,BOOK V.,
2591,BOOK V.,"With this he hurled his spear, and Minerva guided it on to"
2592,BOOK V.,Pandarus’s nose near the eye. It went crashing in among his white
2593,BOOK V.,"teeth; the bronze point cut through the root of his tongue,"
2594,BOOK V.,"coming out under his chin, and his glistening armour rang"
2595,BOOK V.,rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. The horses
2596,BOOK V.,"started aside for fear, and he was reft of life and strength."
2597,BOOK V.,
2598,BOOK V.,"Aeneas sprang from his chariot armed with shield and spear,"
2599,BOOK V.,fearing lest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He bestrode
2600,BOOK V.,"it as a lion in the pride of strength, with shield and spear"
2601,BOOK V.,before him and a cry of battle on his lips resolute to kill the
2602,BOOK V.,first that should dare face him. But the son of Tydeus caught up
2603,BOOK V.,"a mighty stone, so huge and great that as men now are it would"
2604,BOOK V.,take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore it aloft with ease
2605,BOOK V.,"unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas on the groin where the"
2606,BOOK V.,hip turns in the joint that is called the “cup-bone.” The stone
2607,BOOK V.,"crushed this joint, and broke both the sinews, while its jagged"
2608,BOOK V.,"edges tore away all the flesh. The hero fell on his knees, and"
2609,BOOK V.,propped himself with his hand resting on the ground till the
2610,BOOK V.,"darkness of night fell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas, king of"
2611,BOOK V.,"men, would have perished then and there, had not his mother,"
2612,BOOK V.,"Jove’s daughter Venus, who had conceived him by Anchises when he"
2613,BOOK V.,"was herding cattle, been quick to mark, and thrown her two white"
2614,BOOK V.,arms about the body of her dear son. She protected him by
2615,BOOK V.,"covering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest some"
2616,BOOK V.,Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him.
2617,BOOK V.,
2618,BOOK V.,"Thus, then, did she bear her dear son out of the fight. But the"
2619,BOOK V.,son of Capaneus was not unmindful of the orders that Diomed had
2620,BOOK V.,"given him. He made his own horses fast, away from the"
2621,BOOK V.,"hurly-burly, by binding the reins to the rim of the chariot. Then"
2622,BOOK V.,he sprang upon Aeneas’s horses and drove them from the Trojan to
2623,BOOK V.,the Achaean ranks. When he had so done he gave them over to his
2624,BOOK V.,"chosen comrade Deipylus, whom he valued above all others as the"
2625,BOOK V.,"one who was most like-minded with himself, to take them on to the"
2626,BOOK V.,"ships. He then remounted his own chariot, seized the reins, and"
2627,BOOK V.,drove with all speed in search of the son of Tydeus.
2628,BOOK V.,
2629,BOOK V.,"Now the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess,"
2630,BOOK V.,"spear in hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those"
2631,BOOK V.,goddesses that can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or
2632,BOOK V.,"Enyo the waster of cities, and when at last after a long chase he"
2633,BOOK V.,"caught her up, he flew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh"
2634,BOOK V.,of her delicate hand. The point tore through the ambrosial robe
2635,BOOK V.,"which the Graces had woven for her, and pierced the skin between"
2636,BOOK V.,"her wrist and the palm of her hand, so that the immortal blood,"
2637,BOOK V.,"or ichor, that flows in the veins of the blessed gods, came"
2638,BOOK V.,pouring from the wound; for the gods do not eat bread nor drink
2639,BOOK V.,"wine, hence they have no blood such as ours, and are immortal."
2640,BOOK V.,"Venus screamed aloud, and let her son fall, but Phoebus Apollo"
2641,BOOK V.,"caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of darkness, lest"
2642,BOOK V.,some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him;
2643,BOOK V.,"and Diomed shouted out as he left her, “Daughter of Jove, leave"
2644,BOOK V.,"war and battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling"
2645,BOOK V.,silly women? If you meddle with fighting you will get what will
2646,BOOK V.,make you shudder at the very name of war.”
2647,BOOK V.,
2648,BOOK V.,"The goddess went dazed and discomfited away, and Iris, fleet as"
2649,BOOK V.,"the wind, drew her from the throng, in pain and with her fair"
2650,BOOK V.,skin all besmirched. She found fierce Mars waiting on the left of
2651,BOOK V.,"the battle, with his spear and his two fleet steeds resting on a"
2652,BOOK V.,cloud; whereon she fell on her knees before her brother and
2653,BOOK V.,"implored him to let her have his horses. “Dear brother,” she"
2654,BOOK V.,"cried, “save me, and give me your horses to take me to Olympus"
2655,BOOK V.,"where the gods dwell. I am badly wounded by a mortal, the son of"
2656,BOOK V.,"Tydeus, who would now fight even with father Jove.”"
2657,BOOK V.,
2658,BOOK V.,"Thus she spoke, and Mars gave her his gold-bedizened steeds. She"
2659,BOOK V.,"mounted the chariot sick and sorry at heart, while Iris sat"
2660,BOOK V.,beside her and took the reins in her hand. She lashed her horses
2661,BOOK V.,"on and they flew forward nothing loth, till in a trice they were"
2662,BOOK V.,"at high Olympus, where the gods have their dwelling. There she"
2663,BOOK V.,"stayed them, unloosed them from the chariot, and gave them their"
2664,BOOK V.,ambrosial forage; but Venus flung herself on to the lap of her
2665,BOOK V.,"mother Dione, who threw her arms about her and caressed her,"
2666,BOOK V.,"saying, “Which of the heavenly beings has been treating you in"
2667,BOOK V.,"this way, as though you had been doing something wrong in the"
2668,BOOK V.,face of day?”
2669,BOOK V.,
2670,BOOK V.,"And laughter-loving Venus answered, “Proud Diomed, the son of"
2671,BOOK V.,"Tydeus, wounded me because I was bearing my dear son Aeneas, whom"
2672,BOOK V.,"I love best of all mankind, out of the fight. The war is no"
2673,BOOK V.,"longer one between Trojans and Achaeans, for the Danaans have now"
2674,BOOK V.,taken to fighting with the immortals.”
2675,BOOK V.,
2676,BOOK V.,"“Bear it, my child,” replied Dione, “and make the best of it. We"
2677,BOOK V.,"dwellers in Olympus have to put up with much at the hands of men,"
2678,BOOK V.,and we lay much suffering on one another. Mars had to suffer when
2679,BOOK V.,"Otus and Ephialtes, children of Aloeus, bound him in cruel bonds,"
2680,BOOK V.,so that he lay thirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze.
2681,BOOK V.,"Mars would have then perished had not fair Eeriboea, stepmother"
2682,BOOK V.,"to the sons of Aloeus, told Mercury, who stole him away when he"
2683,BOOK V.,was already well-nigh worn out by the severity of his bondage.
2684,BOOK V.,"Juno, again, suffered when the mighty son of Amphitryon wounded"
2685,BOOK V.,"her on the right breast with a three-barbed arrow, and nothing"
2686,BOOK V.,"could assuage her pain. So, also, did huge Hades, when this same"
2687,BOOK V.,"man, the son of aegis-bearing Jove, hit him with an arrow even at"
2688,BOOK V.,"the gates of hell, and hurt him badly. Thereon Hades went to the"
2689,BOOK V.,"house of Jove on great Olympus, angry and full of pain; and the"
2690,BOOK V.,arrow in his brawny shoulder caused him great anguish till Paeeon
2691,BOOK V.,"healed him by spreading soothing herbs on the wound, for Hades"
2692,BOOK V.,"was not of mortal mould. Daring, headstrong, evildoer who recked"
2693,BOOK V.,not of his sin in shooting the gods that dwell in Olympus. And
2694,BOOK V.,"now Minerva has egged this son of Tydeus on against yourself,"
2695,BOOK V.,fool that he is for not reflecting that no man who fights with
2696,BOOK V.,gods will live long or hear his children prattling about his
2697,BOOK V.,"knees when he returns from battle. Let, then, the son of Tydeus"
2698,BOOK V.,see that he does not have to fight with one who is stronger than
2699,BOOK V.,"you are. Then shall his brave wife Aegialeia, daughter of"
2700,BOOK V.,"Adrestus, rouse her whole house from sleep, wailing for the loss"
2701,BOOK V.,"of her wedded lord, Diomed the bravest of the Achaeans.”"
2702,BOOK V.,
2703,BOOK V.,"So saying, she wiped the ichor from the wrist of her daughter"
2704,BOOK V.,"with both hands, whereon the pain left her, and her hand was"
2705,BOOK V.,"healed. But Minerva and Juno, who were looking on, began to taunt"
2706,BOOK V.,"Jove with their mocking talk, and Minerva was first to speak."
2707,BOOK V.,"“Father Jove,” said she, “do not be angry with me, but I think"
2708,BOOK V.,the Cyprian must have been persuading some one of the Achaean
2709,BOOK V.,"women to go with the Trojans of whom she is so very fond, and"
2710,BOOK V.,while caressing one or other of them she must have torn her
2711,BOOK V.,delicate hand with the gold pin of the woman’s brooch.”
2712,BOOK V.,
2713,BOOK V.,"The sire of gods and men smiled, and called golden Venus to his"
2714,BOOK V.,"side. “My child,” said he, “it has not been given you to be a"
2715,BOOK V.,"warrior. Attend, henceforth, to your own delightful matrimonial"
2716,BOOK V.,"duties, and leave all this fighting to Mars and to Minerva.”"
2717,BOOK V.,
2718,BOOK V.,"Thus did they converse. But Diomed sprang upon Aeneas, though he"
2719,BOOK V.,knew him to be in the very arms of Apollo. Not one whit did he
2720,BOOK V.,"fear the mighty god, so set was he on killing Aeneas and"
2721,BOOK V.,stripping him of his armour. Thrice did he spring forward with
2722,BOOK V.,"might and main to slay him, and thrice did Apollo beat back his"
2723,BOOK V.,"gleaming shield. When he was coming on for the fourth time, as"
2724,BOOK V.,"though he were a god, Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice"
2725,BOOK V.,"and said, “Take heed, son of Tydeus, and draw off; think not to"
2726,BOOK V.,"match yourself against gods, for men that walk the earth cannot"
2727,BOOK V.,hold their own with the immortals.”
2728,BOOK V.,
2729,BOOK V.,"The son of Tydeus then gave way for a little space, to avoid the"
2730,BOOK V.,"anger of the god, while Apollo took Aeneas out of the crowd and"
2731,BOOK V.,"set him in sacred Pergamus, where his temple stood. There, within"
2732,BOOK V.,"the mighty sanctuary, Latona and Diana healed him and made him"
2733,BOOK V.,"glorious to behold, while Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a"
2734,BOOK V.,"wraith in the likeness of Aeneas, and armed as he was. Round this"
2735,BOOK V.,the Trojans and Achaeans hacked at the bucklers about one
2736,BOOK V.,"another’s breasts, hewing each other’s round shields and light"
2737,BOOK V.,"hide-covered targets. Then Phoebus Apollo said to Mars, “Mars,"
2738,BOOK V.,"Mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of cities, can you not"
2739,BOOK V.,"go to this man, the son of Tydeus, who would now fight even with"
2740,BOOK V.,"father Jove, and draw him out of the battle? He first went up to"
2741,BOOK V.,"the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and"
2742,BOOK V.,"afterwards sprang upon me too, as though he were a god.”"
2743,BOOK V.,
2744,BOOK V.,"He then took his seat on the top of Pergamus, while murderous"
2745,BOOK V.,"Mars went about among the ranks of the Trojans, cheering them on,"
2746,BOOK V.,in the likeness of fleet Acamas chief of the Thracians. “Sons of
2747,BOOK V.,"Priam,” said he, “how long will you let your people be thus"
2748,BOOK V.,slaughtered by the Achaeans? Would you wait till they are at the
2749,BOOK V.,"walls of Troy? Aeneas the son of Anchises has fallen, he whom we"
2750,BOOK V.,"held in as high honour as Hector himself. Help me, then, to"
2751,BOOK V.,rescue our brave comrade from the stress of the fight.”
2752,BOOK V.,
2753,BOOK V.,With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Then
2754,BOOK V.,"Sarpedon rebuked Hector very sternly. “Hector,” said he, “where"
2755,BOOK V.,is your prowess now? You used to say that though you had neither
2756,BOOK V.,people nor allies you could hold the town alone with your
2757,BOOK V.,brothers and brothers-in-law. I see not one of them here; they
2758,BOOK V.,"cower as hounds before a lion; it is we, your allies, who bear"
2759,BOOK V.,"the brunt of the battle. I have come from afar, even from Lycia"
2760,BOOK V.,"and the banks of the river Xanthus, where I have left my wife, my"
2761,BOOK V.,"infant son, and much wealth to tempt whoever is needy;"
2762,BOOK V.,"nevertheless, I head my Lycian soldiers and stand my ground"
2763,BOOK V.,against any who would fight me though I have nothing here for the
2764,BOOK V.,"Achaeans to plunder, while you look on, without even bidding your"
2765,BOOK V.,men stand firm in defence of their wives. See that you fall not
2766,BOOK V.,"into the hands of your foes as men caught in the meshes of a net,"
2767,BOOK V.,and they sack your fair city forthwith. Keep this before your
2768,BOOK V.,"mind night and day, and beseech the captains of your allies to"
2769,BOOK V.,"hold on without flinching, and thus put away their reproaches"
2770,BOOK V.,from you.”
2771,BOOK V.,
2772,BOOK V.,"So spoke Sarpedon, and Hector smarted under his words. He sprang"
2773,BOOK V.,"from his chariot clad in his suit of armour, and went about among"
2774,BOOK V.,"the host brandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight"
2775,BOOK V.,and raising the terrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and
2776,BOOK V.,"again faced the Achaeans, but the Argives stood compact and firm,"
2777,BOOK V.,and were not driven back. As the breezes sport with the chaff
2778,BOOK V.,"upon some goodly threshing-floor, when men are winnowing—while"
2779,BOOK V.,yellow Ceres blows with the wind to sift the chaff from the
2780,BOOK V.,"grain, and the chaff-heaps grow whiter and whiter—even so did the"
2781,BOOK V.,Achaeans whiten in the dust which the horses’ hoofs raised to the
2782,BOOK V.,"firmament of heaven, as their drivers turned them back to battle,"
2783,BOOK V.,"and they bore down with might upon the foe. Fierce Mars, to help"
2784,BOOK V.,"the Trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and went about"
2785,BOOK V.,"everywhere among them, inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told him"
2786,BOOK V.,that when he saw Pallas Minerva leave the fray he was to put
2787,BOOK V.,courage into the hearts of the Trojans—for it was she who was
2788,BOOK V.,helping the Danaans. Then Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich
2789,BOOK V.,"sanctuary, and filled his heart with valour, whereon he took his"
2790,BOOK V.,"place among his comrades, who were overjoyed at seeing him alive,"
2791,BOOK V.,"sound, and of a good courage; but they could not ask him how it"
2792,BOOK V.,"had all happened, for they were too busy with the turmoil raised"
2793,BOOK V.,"by Mars and by Strife, who raged insatiably in their midst."
2794,BOOK V.,
2795,BOOK V.,"The two Ajaxes, Ulysses and Diomed, cheered the Danaans on,"
2796,BOOK V.,fearless of the fury and onset of the Trojans. They stood as
2797,BOOK V.,still as clouds which the son of Saturn has spread upon the
2798,BOOK V.,mountain tops when there is no air and fierce Boreas sleeps with
2799,BOOK V.,the other boisterous winds whose shrill blasts scatter the clouds
2800,BOOK V.,in all directions—even so did the Danaans stand firm and
2801,BOOK V.,unflinching against the Trojans. The son of Atreus went about
2802,BOOK V.,"among them and exhorted them. “My friends,” said he, “quit"
2803,BOOK V.,"yourselves like brave men, and shun dishonour in one another’s"
2804,BOOK V.,eyes amid the stress of battle. They that shun dishonour more
2805,BOOK V.,"often live than get killed, but they that fly save neither life"
2806,BOOK V.,nor name.”
2807,BOOK V.,
2808,BOOK V.,As he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of those who were in
2809,BOOK V.,"the front rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deicoon son of Pergasus,"
2810,BOOK V.,"whom the Trojans held in no less honour than the sons of Priam,"
2811,BOOK V.,for he was ever quick to place himself among the foremost. The
2812,BOOK V.,spear of King Agamemnon struck his shield and went right through
2813,BOOK V.,"it, for the shield stayed it not. It drove through his belt into"
2814,BOOK V.,"the lower part of his belly, and his armour rang rattling round"
2815,BOOK V.,him as he fell heavily to the ground.
2816,BOOK V.,
2817,BOOK V.,"Then Aeneas killed two champions of the Danaans, Crethon and"
2818,BOOK V.,Orsilochus. Their father was a rich man who lived in the strong
2819,BOOK V.,"city of Phere and was descended from the river Alpheus, whose"
2820,BOOK V.,broad stream flows through the land of the Pylians. The river
2821,BOOK V.,"begat Orsilochus, who ruled over much people and was father to"
2822,BOOK V.,"Diocles, who in his turn begat twin sons, Crethon and Orsilochus,"
2823,BOOK V.,"well skilled in all the arts of war. These, when they grew up,"
2824,BOOK V.,went to Ilius with the Argive fleet in the cause of Menelaus and
2825,BOOK V.,"Agamemnon sons of Atreus, and there they both of them fell. As"
2826,BOOK V.,two lions whom their dam has reared in the depths of some
2827,BOOK V.,mountain forest to plunder homesteads and carry off sheep and
2828,BOOK V.,"cattle till they get killed by the hand of man, so were these two"
2829,BOOK V.,"vanquished by Aeneas, and fell like high pine-trees to the"
2830,BOOK V.,ground.
2831,BOOK V.,
2832,BOOK V.,"Brave Menelaus pitied them in their fall, and made his way to the"
2833,BOOK V.,"front, clad in gleaming bronze and brandishing his spear, for"
2834,BOOK V.,Mars egged him on to do so with intent that he should be killed
2835,BOOK V.,by Aeneas; but Antilochus the son of Nestor saw him and sprang
2836,BOOK V.,"forward, fearing that the king might come to harm and thus bring"
2837,BOOK V.,"all their labour to nothing; when, therefore Aeneas and Menelaus"
2838,BOOK V.,were setting their hands and spears against one another eager to
2839,BOOK V.,"do battle, Antilochus placed himself by the side of Menelaus."
2840,BOOK V.,"Aeneas, bold though he was, drew back on seeing the two heroes"
2841,BOOK V.,"side by side in front of him, so they drew the bodies of Crethon"
2842,BOOK V.,and Orsilochus to the ranks of the Achaeans and committed the two
2843,BOOK V.,poor fellows into the hands of their comrades. They then turned
2844,BOOK V.,back and fought in the front ranks.
2845,BOOK V.,
2846,BOOK V.,"They killed Pylaemenes peer of Mars, leader of the Paphlagonian"
2847,BOOK V.,warriors. Menelaus struck him on the collar-bone as he was
2848,BOOK V.,"standing on his chariot, while Antilochus hit his charioteer and"
2849,BOOK V.,"squire Mydon, the son of Atymnius, who was turning his horses in"
2850,BOOK V.,"flight. He hit him with a stone upon the elbow, and the reins,"
2851,BOOK V.,"enriched with white ivory, fell from his hands into the dust."
2852,BOOK V.,Antilochus rushed towards him and struck him on the temples with
2853,BOOK V.,"his sword, whereon he fell head first from the chariot to the"
2854,BOOK V.,ground. There he stood for a while with his head and shoulders
2855,BOOK V.,buried deep in the dust—for he had fallen on sandy soil till his
2856,BOOK V.,"horses kicked him and laid him flat on the ground, as Antilochus"
2857,BOOK V.,lashed them and drove them off to the host of the Achaeans.
2858,BOOK V.,
2859,BOOK V.,"But Hector marked them from across the ranks, and with a loud cry"
2860,BOOK V.,"rushed towards them, followed by the strong battalions of the"
2861,BOOK V.,"Trojans. Mars and dread Enyo led them on, she fraught with"
2862,BOOK V.,"ruthless turmoil of battle, while Mars wielded a monstrous spear,"
2863,BOOK V.,"and went about, now in front of Hector and now behind him."
2864,BOOK V.,
2865,BOOK V.,Diomed shook with passion as he saw them. As a man crossing a
2866,BOOK V.,wide plain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some great
2867,BOOK V.,river rolling swiftly to the sea—he sees its boiling waters and
2868,BOOK V.,starts back in fear—even so did the son of Tydeus give ground.
2869,BOOK V.,"Then he said to his men, “My friends, how can we wonder that"
2870,BOOK V.,Hector wields the spear so well? Some god is ever by his side to
2871,BOOK V.,"protect him, and now Mars is with him in the likeness of mortal"
2872,BOOK V.,"man. Keep your faces therefore towards the Trojans, but give"
2873,BOOK V.,"ground backwards, for we dare not fight with gods.”"
2874,BOOK V.,
2875,BOOK V.,"As he spoke the Trojans drew close up, and Hector killed two men,"
2876,BOOK V.,"both in one chariot, Menesthes and Anchialus, heroes well versed"
2877,BOOK V.,in war. Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came
2878,BOOK V.,"close up and hurled his spear, hitting Amphius the son of"
2879,BOOK V.,"Selagus, a man of great wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much"
2880,BOOK V.,"corn-growing land, but his lot had led him to come to the aid of"
2881,BOOK V.,Priam and his sons. Ajax struck him in the belt; the spear
2882,BOOK V.,"pierced the lower part of his belly, and he fell heavily to the"
2883,BOOK V.,"ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to strip him of his armour, but"
2884,BOOK V.,"the Trojans rained spears upon him, many of which fell upon his"
2885,BOOK V.,"shield. He planted his heel upon the body and drew out his spear,"
2886,BOOK V.,but the darts pressed so heavily upon him that he could not strip
2887,BOOK V.,"the goodly armour from his shoulders. The Trojan chieftains,"
2888,BOOK V.,"moreover, many and valiant, came about him with their spears, so"
2889,BOOK V.,"that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiant though he was,"
2890,BOOK V.,they drove him from them and he was beaten back.
2891,BOOK V.,
2892,BOOK V.,"Thus, then, did the battle rage between them. Presently the"
2893,BOOK V.,"strong hand of fate impelled Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, a"
2894,BOOK V.,"man both brave and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the"
2895,BOOK V.,"two, son and grandson of great Jove, drew near to one another,"
2896,BOOK V.,"and Tlepolemus spoke first. “Sarpedon,” said he, “councillor of"
2897,BOOK V.,"the Lycians, why should you come skulking here you who are a man"
2898,BOOK V.,"of peace? They lie who call you son of aegis-bearing Jove, for"
2899,BOOK V.,you are little like those who were of old his children. Far other
2900,BOOK V.,"was Hercules, my own brave and lion-hearted father, who came here"
2901,BOOK V.,"for the horses of Laomedon, and though he had six ships only, and"
2902,BOOK V.,"few men to follow him, sacked the city of Ilius and made a"
2903,BOOK V.,"wilderness of her highways. You are a coward, and your people are"
2904,BOOK V.,"falling from you. For all your strength, and all your coming from"
2905,BOOK V.,"Lycia, you will be no help to the Trojans but will pass the gates"
2906,BOOK V.,of Hades vanquished by my hand.”
2907,BOOK V.,
2908,BOOK V.,"And Sarpedon, captain of the Lycians, answered, “Tlepolemus, your"
2909,BOOK V.,father overthrew Ilius by reason of Laomedon’s folly in refusing
2910,BOOK V.,payment to one who had served him well. He would not give your
2911,BOOK V.,father the horses which he had come so far to fetch. As for
2912,BOOK V.,"yourself, you shall meet death by my spear. You shall yield glory"
2913,BOOK V.,"to myself, and your soul to Hades of the noble steeds.”"
2914,BOOK V.,
2915,BOOK V.,"Thus spoke Sarpedon, and Tlepolemus upraised his spear. They"
2916,BOOK V.,"threw at the same moment, and Sarpedon struck his foe in the"
2917,BOOK V.,"middle of his throat; the spear went right through, and the"
2918,BOOK V.,darkness of death fell upon his eyes. Tlepolemus’s spear struck
2919,BOOK V.,Sarpedon on the left thigh with such force that it tore through
2920,BOOK V.,"the flesh and grazed the bone, but his father as yet warded off"
2921,BOOK V.,destruction from him.
2922,BOOK V.,
2923,BOOK V.,"His comrades bore Sarpedon out of the fight, in great pain by the"
2924,BOOK V.,weight of the spear that was dragging from his wound. They were
2925,BOOK V.,in such haste and stress as they bore him that no one thought of
2926,BOOK V.,drawing the spear from his thigh so as to let him walk uprightly.
2927,BOOK V.,"Meanwhile the Achaeans carried off the body of Tlepolemus,"
2928,BOOK V.,"whereon Ulysses was moved to pity, and panted for the fray as he"
2929,BOOK V.,"beheld them. He doubted whether to pursue the son of Jove, or to"
2930,BOOK V.,"make slaughter of the Lycian rank and file; it was not decreed,"
2931,BOOK V.,"however, that he should slay the son of Jove; Minerva, therefore,"
2932,BOOK V.,turned him against the main body of the Lycians. He killed
2933,BOOK V.,"Coeranus, Alastor, Chromius, Alcandrus, Halius, Noemon, and"
2934,BOOK V.,"Prytanis, and would have slain yet more, had not great Hector"
2935,BOOK V.,"marked him, and sped to the front of the fight clad in his suit"
2936,BOOK V.,"of mail, filling the Danaans with terror. Sarpedon was glad when"
2937,BOOK V.,"he saw him coming, and besought him, saying, “Son of Priam, let"
2938,BOOK V.,"me not be here to fall into the hands of the Danaans. Help me,"
2939,BOOK V.,and since I may not return home to gladden the hearts of my wife
2940,BOOK V.,"and of my infant son, let me die within the walls of your city.”"
2941,BOOK V.,
2942,BOOK V.,"Hector made him no answer, but rushed onward to fall at once upon"
2943,BOOK V.,the Achaeans and kill many among them. His comrades then bore
2944,BOOK V.,Sarpedon away and laid him beneath Jove’s spreading oak tree.
2945,BOOK V.,"Pelagon, his friend and comrade, drew the spear out of his thigh,"
2946,BOOK V.,but Sarpedon fainted and a mist came over his eyes. Presently he
2947,BOOK V.,"came to himself again, for the breath of the north wind as it"
2948,BOOK V.,"played upon him gave him new life, and brought him out of the"
2949,BOOK V.,deep swoon into which he had fallen.
2950,BOOK V.,
2951,BOOK V.,Meanwhile the Argives were neither driven towards their ships by
2952,BOOK V.,"Mars and Hector, nor yet did they attack them; when they knew"
2953,BOOK V.,"that Mars was with the Trojans they retreated, but kept their"
2954,BOOK V.,"faces still turned towards the foe. Who, then, was first and who"
2955,BOOK V.,"last to be slain by Mars and Hector? They were valiant Teuthras,"
2956,BOOK V.,"and Orestes the renowned charioteer, Trechus the Aetolian"
2957,BOOK V.,"warrior, Oenomaus, Helenus the son of Oenops, and Oresbius of the"
2958,BOOK V.,"gleaming girdle, who was possessed of great wealth, and dwelt by"
2959,BOOK V.,"the Cephisian lake with the other Boeotians who lived near him,"
2960,BOOK V.,owners of a fertile country.
2961,BOOK V.,
2962,BOOK V.,"Now when the goddess Juno saw the Argives thus falling, she said"
2963,BOOK V.,"to Minerva, “Alas, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable,"
2964,BOOK V.,the promise we made Menelaus that he should not return till he
2965,BOOK V.,had sacked the city of Ilius will be of no effect if we let Mars
2966,BOOK V.,rage thus furiously. Let us go into the fray at once.”
2967,BOOK V.,
2968,BOOK V.,"Minerva did not gainsay her. Thereon the august goddess, daughter"
2969,BOOK V.,"of great Saturn, began to harness her gold-bedizened steeds. Hebe"
2970,BOOK V.,with all speed fitted on the eight-spoked wheels of bronze that
2971,BOOK V.,were on either side of the iron axle-tree. The felloes of the
2972,BOOK V.,"wheels were of gold, imperishable, and over these there was a"
2973,BOOK V.,"tire of bronze, wondrous to behold. The naves of the wheels were"
2974,BOOK V.,"silver, turning round the axle upon either side. The car itself"
2975,BOOK V.,"was made with plaited bands of gold and silver, and it had a"
2976,BOOK V.,double top-rail running all round it. From the body of the car
2977,BOOK V.,"there went a pole of silver, on to the end of which she bound the"
2978,BOOK V.,"golden yoke, with the bands of gold that were to go under the"
2979,BOOK V.,"necks of the horses. Then Juno put her steeds under the yoke,"
2980,BOOK V.,eager for battle and the war-cry.
2981,BOOK V.,
2982,BOOK V.,"Meanwhile Minerva flung her richly embroidered vesture, made with"
2983,BOOK V.,"her own hands, on to her father’s threshold, and donned the shirt"
2984,BOOK V.,"of Jove, arming herself for battle. She threw her tasselled aegis"
2985,BOOK V.,"about her shoulders, wreathed round with Rout as with a fringe,"
2986,BOOK V.,"and on it were Strife, and Strength, and Panic whose blood runs"
2987,BOOK V.,"cold; moreover there was the head of the dread monster Gorgon,"
2988,BOOK V.,"grim and awful to behold, portent of aegis-bearing Jove. On her"
2989,BOOK V.,"head she set her helmet of gold, with four plumes, and coming to"
2990,BOOK V.,a peak both in front and behind—decked with the emblems of a
2991,BOOK V.,hundred cities; then she stepped into her flaming chariot and
2992,BOOK V.,"grasped the spear, so stout and sturdy and strong, with which she"
2993,BOOK V.,quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno lashed
2994,BOOK V.,"the horses on, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew open"
2995,BOOK V.,"of their own accord—gates over which the Hours preside, in whose"
2996,BOOK V.,"hands are Heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense cloud that"
2997,BOOK V.,"hides them, or to close it. Through these the goddesses drove"
2998,BOOK V.,"their obedient steeds, and found the son of Saturn sitting all"
2999,BOOK V.,alone on the topmost ridges of Olympus. There Juno stayed her
3000,BOOK V.,"horses, and spoke to Jove the son of Saturn, lord of all. “Father"
3001,BOOK V.,"Jove,” said she, “are you not angry with Mars for these high"
3002,BOOK V.,doings? how great and goodly a host of the Achaeans he has
3003,BOOK V.,"destroyed to my great grief, and without either right or reason,"
3004,BOOK V.,while the Cyprian and Apollo are enjoying it all at their ease
3005,BOOK V.,and setting this unrighteous madman on to do further mischief. I
3006,BOOK V.,"hope, Father Jove, that you will not be angry if I hit Mars hard,"
3007,BOOK V.,and chase him out of the battle.”
3008,BOOK V.,
3009,BOOK V.,"And Jove answered, “Set Minerva on to him, for she punishes him"
3010,BOOK V.,more often than any one else does.”
3011,BOOK V.,
3012,BOOK V.,"Juno did as he had said. She lashed her horses, and they flew"
3013,BOOK V.,forward nothing loth midway betwixt earth and sky. As far as a
3014,BOOK V.,"man can see when he looks out upon the sea from some high beacon,"
3015,BOOK V.,so far can the loud-neighing horses of the gods spring at a
3016,BOOK V.,single bound. When they reached Troy and the place where its two
3017,BOOK V.,"flowing streams Simois and Scamander meet, there Juno stayed them"
3018,BOOK V.,"and took them from the chariot. She hid them in a thick cloud,"
3019,BOOK V.,and Simois made ambrosia spring up for them to eat; the two
3020,BOOK V.,"goddesses then went on, flying like turtledoves in their"
3021,BOOK V.,eagerness to help the Argives. When they came to the part where
3022,BOOK V.,"the bravest and most in number were gathered about mighty Diomed,"
3023,BOOK V.,fighting like lions or wild boars of great strength and
3024,BOOK V.,"endurance, there Juno stood still and raised a shout like that of"
3025,BOOK V.,"brazen-voiced Stentor, whose cry was as loud as that of fifty men"
3026,BOOK V.,"together. “Argives,” she cried; “shame on cowardly creatures,"
3027,BOOK V.,"brave in semblance only; as long as Achilles was fighting, if his"
3028,BOOK V.,spear was so deadly that the Trojans dared not show themselves
3029,BOOK V.,"outside the Dardanian gates, but now they sally far from the city"
3030,BOOK V.,and fight even at your ships.”
3031,BOOK V.,
3032,BOOK V.,"With these words she put heart and soul into them all, while"
3033,BOOK V.,"Minerva sprang to the side of the son of Tydeus, whom she found"
3034,BOOK V.,"near his chariot and horses, cooling the wound that Pandarus had"
3035,BOOK V.,given him. For the sweat caused by the hand that bore the weight
3036,BOOK V.,"of his shield irritated the hurt: his arm was weary with pain,"
3037,BOOK V.,and he was lifting up the strap to wipe away the blood. The
3038,BOOK V.,"goddess laid her hand on the yoke of his horses and said, “The"
3039,BOOK V.,son of Tydeus is not such another as his father. Tydeus was a
3040,BOOK V.,"little man, but he could fight, and rushed madly into the fray"
3041,BOOK V.,even when I told him not to do so. When he went all unattended as
3042,BOOK V.,"envoy to the city of Thebes among the Cadmeans, I bade him feast"
3043,BOOK V.,in their houses and be at peace; but with that high spirit which
3044,BOOK V.,"was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of the"
3045,BOOK V.,"Cadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, so"
3046,BOOK V.,"mightily did I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and I"
3047,BOOK V.,bid you be instant in fighting the Trojans; but either you are
3048,BOOK V.,"tired out, or you are afraid and out of heart, and in that case I"
3049,BOOK V.,say that you are no true son of Tydeus the son of Oeneus.”
3050,BOOK V.,
3051,BOOK V.,"Diomed answered, “I know you, goddess, daughter of aegis-bearing"
3052,BOOK V.,"Jove, and will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid nor out of"
3053,BOOK V.,"heart, nor is there any slackness in me. I am only following your"
3054,BOOK V.,own instructions; you told me not to fight any of the blessed
3055,BOOK V.,gods; but if Jove’s daughter Venus came into battle I was to
3056,BOOK V.,"wound her with my spear. Therefore I am retreating, and bidding"
3057,BOOK V.,"the other Argives gather in this place, for I know that Mars is"
3058,BOOK V.,now lording it in the field.”
3059,BOOK V.,
3060,BOOK V.,"“Diomed, son of Tydeus,” replied Minerva, “man after my own"
3061,BOOK V.,"heart, fear neither Mars nor any other of the immortals, for I"
3062,BOOK V.,"will befriend you. Nay, drive straight at Mars, and smite him in"
3063,BOOK V.,"close combat; fear not this raging madman, villain incarnate,"
3064,BOOK V.,first on one side and then on the other. But now he was holding
3065,BOOK V.,"talk with Juno and myself, saying he would help the Argives and"
3066,BOOK V.,"attack the Trojans; nevertheless he is with the Trojans, and has"
3067,BOOK V.,forgotten the Argives.”
3068,BOOK V.,
3069,BOOK V.,With this she caught hold of Sthenelus and lifted him off the
3070,BOOK V.,"chariot on to the ground. In a second he was on the ground,"
3071,BOOK V.,whereupon the goddess mounted the car and placed herself by the
3072,BOOK V.,side of Diomed. The oaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of
3073,BOOK V.,the awful goddess and the hero; Pallas Minerva took the whip and
3074,BOOK V.,"reins, and drove straight at Mars. He was in the act of stripping"
3075,BOOK V.,"huge Periphas, son of Ochesius and bravest of the Aetolians."
3076,BOOK V.,"Bloody Mars was stripping him of his armour, and Minerva donned"
3077,BOOK V.,"the helmet of Hades, that he might not see her; when, therefore,"
3078,BOOK V.,"he saw Diomed, he made straight for him and let Periphas lie"
3079,BOOK V.,where he had fallen. As soon as they were at close quarters he
3080,BOOK V.,"let fly with his bronze spear over the reins and yoke, thinking"
3081,BOOK V.,"to take Diomed’s life, but Minerva caught the spear in her hand"
3082,BOOK V.,"and made it fly harmlessly over the chariot. Diomed then threw,"
3083,BOOK V.,and Pallas Minerva drove the spear into the pit of Mars’s stomach
3084,BOOK V.,"where his under-girdle went round him. There Diomed wounded him,"
3085,BOOK V.,tearing his fair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Mars
3086,BOOK V.,roared as loudly as nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a
3087,BOOK V.,"fight, and the Achaeans and Trojans were struck with panic, so"
3088,BOOK V.,terrible was the cry he raised.
3089,BOOK V.,
3090,BOOK V.,"As a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to blow after heat,"
3091,BOOK V.,even so did Diomed son of Tydeus see Mars ascend into the broad
3092,BOOK V.,"heavens. With all speed he reached high Olympus, home of the"
3093,BOOK V.,"gods, and in great pain sat down beside Jove the son of Saturn."
3094,BOOK V.,He showed Jove the immortal blood that was flowing from his
3095,BOOK V.,"wound, and spoke piteously, saying, “Father Jove, are you not"
3096,BOOK V.,angered by such doings? We gods are continually suffering in the
3097,BOOK V.,most cruel manner at one another’s hands while helping mortals;
3098,BOOK V.,and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten that mad
3099,BOOK V.,"termagant of a daughter, who is always committing outrage of some"
3100,BOOK V.,"kind. We other gods must all do as you bid us, but her you"
3101,BOOK V.,neither scold nor punish; you encourage her because the pestilent
3102,BOOK V.,creature is your daughter. See how she has been inciting proud
3103,BOOK V.,Diomed to vent his rage on the immortal gods. First he went up to
3104,BOOK V.,"the Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then"
3105,BOOK V.,he sprang upon me too as though he were a god. Had I not run for
3106,BOOK V.,it I must either have lain there for long enough in torments
3107,BOOK V.,"among the ghastly corpses, or have been eaten alive with spears"
3108,BOOK V.,till I had no more strength left in me.”
3109,BOOK V.,
3110,BOOK V.,"Jove looked angrily at him and said, “Do not come whining here,"
3111,BOOK V.,Sir Facing-both-ways. I hate you worst of all the gods in
3112,BOOK V.,"Olympus, for you are ever fighting and making mischief. You have"
3113,BOOK V.,the intolerable and stubborn spirit of your mother Juno: it is
3114,BOOK V.,"all I can do to manage her, and it is her doing that you are now"
3115,BOOK V.,"in this plight: still, I cannot let you remain longer in such"
3116,BOOK V.,"great pain; you are my own offspring, and it was by me that your"
3117,BOOK V.,"mother conceived you; if, however, you had been the son of any"
3118,BOOK V.,"other god, you are so destructive that by this time you should"
3119,BOOK V.,have been lying lower than the Titans.”
3120,BOOK V.,
3121,BOOK V.,"He then bade Paeeon heal him, whereon Paeeon spread pain-killing"
3122,BOOK V.,"herbs upon his wound and cured him, for he was not of mortal"
3123,BOOK V.,"mould. As the juice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it"
3124,BOOK V.,"in a moment though it is liquid, even so instantly did Paeeon"
3125,BOOK V.,"cure fierce Mars. Then Hebe washed him, and clothed him in goodly"
3126,BOOK V.,"raiment, and he took his seat by his father Jove all glorious to"
3127,BOOK V.,behold.
3128,BOOK V.,
3129,BOOK V.,"But Juno of Argos and Minerva of Alalcomene, now that they had"
3130,BOOK V.,"put a stop to the murderous doings of Mars, went back again to"
3131,BOOK V.,the house of Jove.

3142,BOOK VI.,The fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as it
3143,BOOK VI.,"would, and the tide of war surged hither and thither over the"
3144,BOOK VI.,plain as they aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another
3145,BOOK VI.,between the streams of Simois and Xanthus.
3146,BOOK VI.,
3147,BOOK VI.,"First, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans,"
3148,BOOK VI.,"broke a phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his"
3149,BOOK VI.,"comrades by killing Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among"
3150,BOOK VI.,"the Thracians, being both brave and of great stature. The spear"
3151,BOOK VI.,struck the projecting peak of his helmet: its bronze point then
3152,BOOK VI.,"went through his forehead into the brain, and darkness veiled his"
3153,BOOK VI.,eyes.
3154,BOOK VI.,
3155,BOOK VI.,"Then Diomed killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived"
3156,BOOK VI.,"in the strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he"
3157,BOOK VI.,"had a house by the roadside, and entertained every one who"
3158,BOOK VI.,passed; howbeit not one of his guests stood before him to save
3159,BOOK VI.,"his life, and Diomed killed both him and his squire Calesius, who"
3160,BOOK VI.,was then his charioteer—so the pair passed beneath the earth.
3161,BOOK VI.,
3162,BOOK VI.,"Euryalus killed Dresus and Opheltius, and then went in pursuit of"
3163,BOOK VI.,"Aesepus and Pedasus, whom the naiad nymph Abarbarea had borne to"
3164,BOOK VI.,"noble Bucolion. Bucolion was eldest son to Laomedon, but he was a"
3165,BOOK VI.,"bastard. While tending his sheep he had converse with the nymph,"
3166,BOOK VI.,"and she conceived twin sons; these the son of Mecisteus now slew,"
3167,BOOK VI.,and he stripped the armour from their shoulders. Polypoetes then
3168,BOOK VI.,"killed Astyalus, Ulysses Pidytes of Percote, and Teucer Aretaon."
3169,BOOK VI.,"Ablerus fell by the spear of Nestor’s son Antilochus, and"
3170,BOOK VI.,"Agamemnon, king of men, killed Elatus who dwelt in Pedasus by the"
3171,BOOK VI.,banks of the river Satnioeis. Leitus killed Phylacus as he was
3172,BOOK VI.,"flying, and Eurypylus slew Melanthus."
3173,BOOK VI.,
3174,BOOK VI.,"Then Menelaus of the loud war-cry took Adrestus alive, for his"
3175,BOOK VI.,"horses ran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over"
3176,BOOK VI.,"the plain, and broke the pole from the car; they went on towards"
3177,BOOK VI.,"the city along with the others in full flight, but Adrestus"
3178,BOOK VI.,"rolled out, and fell in the dust flat on his face by the wheel of"
3179,BOOK VI.,"his chariot; Menelaus came up to him spear in hand, but Adrestus"
3180,BOOK VI.,"caught him by the knees begging for his life. “Take me alive,” he"
3181,BOOK VI.,"cried, “son of Atreus, and you shall have a full ransom for me:"
3182,BOOK VI.,"my father is rich and has much treasure of gold, bronze, and"
3183,BOOK VI.,wrought iron laid by in his house. From this store he will give
3184,BOOK VI.,you a large ransom should he hear of my being alive and at the
3185,BOOK VI.,ships of the Achaeans.”
3186,BOOK VI.,
3187,BOOK VI.,"Thus did he plead, and Menelaus was for yielding and giving him"
3188,BOOK VI.,"to a squire to take to the ships of the Achaeans, but Agamemnon"
3189,BOOK VI.,"came running up to him and rebuked him. “My good Menelaus,” said"
3190,BOOK VI.,"he, “this is no time for giving quarter. Has, then, your house"
3191,BOOK VI.,fared so well at the hands of the Trojans? Let us not spare a
3192,BOOK VI.,single one of them—not even the child unborn and in its mother’s
3193,BOOK VI.,"womb; let not a man of them be left alive, but let all in Ilius"
3194,BOOK VI.,"perish, unheeded and forgotten.”"
3195,BOOK VI.,
3196,BOOK VI.,"Thus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his"
3197,BOOK VI.,"words were just. Menelaus, therefore, thrust Adrestus from him,"
3198,BOOK VI.,"whereon King Agamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell: then"
3199,BOOK VI.,the son of Atreus planted his foot upon his breast to draw his
3200,BOOK VI.,spear from the body.
3201,BOOK VI.,
3202,BOOK VI.,"Meanwhile Nestor shouted to the Argives, saying, “My friends,"
3203,BOOK VI.,"Danaan warriors, servants of Mars, let no man lag that he may"
3204,BOOK VI.,"spoil the dead, and bring back much booty to the ships. Let us"
3205,BOOK VI.,"kill as many as we can; the bodies will lie upon the plain, and"
3206,BOOK VI.,you can despoil them later at your leisure.”
3207,BOOK VI.,
3208,BOOK VI.,With these words he put heart and soul into them all. And now the
3209,BOOK VI.,"Trojans would have been routed and driven back into Ilius, had"
3210,BOOK VI.,"not Priam’s son Helenus, wisest of augurs, said to Hector and"
3211,BOOK VI.,"Aeneas, “Hector and Aeneas, you two are the mainstays of the"
3212,BOOK VI.,"Trojans and Lycians, for you are foremost at all times, alike in"
3213,BOOK VI.,"fight and counsel; hold your ground here, and go about among the"
3214,BOOK VI.,"host to rally them in front of the gates, or they will fling"
3215,BOOK VI.,"themselves into the arms of their wives, to the great joy of our"
3216,BOOK VI.,"foes. Then, when you have put heart into all our companies, we"
3217,BOOK VI.,will stand firm here and fight the Danaans however hard they
3218,BOOK VI.,"press us, for there is nothing else to be done. Meanwhile do you,"
3219,BOOK VI.,"Hector, go to the city and tell our mother what is happening."
3220,BOOK VI.,Tell her to bid the matrons gather at the temple of Minerva in
3221,BOOK VI.,the acropolis; let her then take her key and open the doors of
3222,BOOK VI.,"the sacred building; there, upon the knees of Minerva, let her"
3223,BOOK VI.,"lay the largest, fairest robe she has in her house—the one she"
3224,BOOK VI.,"sets most store by; let her, moreover, promise to sacrifice"
3225,BOOK VI.,"twelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the"
3226,BOOK VI.,"temple of the goddess, if she will take pity on the town, with"
3227,BOOK VI.,"the wives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the son of"
3228,BOOK VI.,Tydeus from falling on the goodly city of Ilius; for he fights
3229,BOOK VI.,with fury and fills men’s souls with panic. I hold him mightiest
3230,BOOK VI.,"of them all; we did not fear even their great champion Achilles,"
3231,BOOK VI.,"son of a goddess though he be, as we do this man: his rage is"
3232,BOOK VI.,"beyond all bounds, and there is none can vie with him in"
3233,BOOK VI.,prowess.”
3234,BOOK VI.,
3235,BOOK VI.,"Hector did as his brother bade him. He sprang from his chariot,"
3236,BOOK VI.,"and went about everywhere among the host, brandishing his spears,"
3237,BOOK VI.,"urging the men on to fight, and raising the dread cry of battle."
3238,BOOK VI.,"Thereon they rallied and again faced the Achaeans, who gave"
3239,BOOK VI.,"ground and ceased their murderous onset, for they deemed that"
3240,BOOK VI.,some one of the immortals had come down from starry heaven to
3241,BOOK VI.,"help the Trojans, so strangely had they rallied. And Hector"
3242,BOOK VI.,"shouted to the Trojans, “Trojans and allies, be men, my friends,"
3243,BOOK VI.,"and fight with might and main, while I go to Ilius and tell the"
3244,BOOK VI.,old men of our council and our wives to pray to the gods and vow
3245,BOOK VI.,hecatombs in their honour.”
3246,BOOK VI.,
3247,BOOK VI.,"With this he went his way, and the black rim of hide that went"
3248,BOOK VI.,round his shield beat against his neck and his ancles.
3249,BOOK VI.,
3250,BOOK VI.,"Then Glaucus son of Hippolochus, and the son of Tydeus went into"
3251,BOOK VI.,the open space between the hosts to fight in single combat. When
3252,BOOK VI.,they were close up to one another Diomed of the loud war-cry was
3253,BOOK VI.,"the first to speak. “Who, my good sir,” said he, “who are you"
3254,BOOK VI.,"among men? I have never seen you in battle until now, but you are"
3255,BOOK VI.,daring beyond all others if you abide my onset. Woe to those
3256,BOOK VI.,"fathers whose sons face my might. If, however, you are one of the"
3257,BOOK VI.,"immortals and have come down from heaven, I will not fight you;"
3258,BOOK VI.,"for even valiant Lycurgus, son of Dryas, did not live long when"
3259,BOOK VI.,he took to fighting with the gods. He it was that drove the
3260,BOOK VI.,nursing women who were in charge of frenzied Bacchus through the
3261,BOOK VI.,"land of Nysa, and they flung their thyrsi on the ground as"
3262,BOOK VI.,murderous Lycurgus beat them with his oxgoad. Bacchus himself
3263,BOOK VI.,"plunged terror-stricken into the sea, and Thetis took him to her"
3264,BOOK VI.,"bosom to comfort him, for he was scared by the fury with which"
3265,BOOK VI.,the man reviled him. Thereon the gods who live at ease were angry
3266,BOOK VI.,"with Lycurgus and the son of Saturn struck him blind, nor did he"
3267,BOOK VI.,live much longer after he had become hateful to the immortals.
3268,BOOK VI.,Therefore I will not fight with the blessed gods; but if you are
3269,BOOK VI.,"of them that eat the fruit of the ground, draw near and meet your"
3270,BOOK VI.,doom.”
3271,BOOK VI.,
3272,BOOK VI.,"And the son of Hippolochus answered, “Son of Tydeus, why ask me"
3273,BOOK VI.,of my lineage? Men come and go as leaves year by year upon the
3274,BOOK VI.,"trees. Those of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when"
3275,BOOK VI.,spring returns the forest buds forth with fresh vines. Even so is
3276,BOOK VI.,"it with the generations of mankind, the new spring up as the old"
3277,BOOK VI.,"are passing away. If, then, you would learn my descent, it is one"
3278,BOOK VI.,that is well known to many. There is a city in the heart of
3279,BOOK VI.,"Argos, pasture land of horses, called Ephyra, where Sisyphus"
3280,BOOK VI.,"lived, who was the craftiest of all mankind. He was the son of"
3281,BOOK VI.,"Aeolus, and had a son named Glaucus, who was father to"
3282,BOOK VI.,"Bellerophon, whom heaven endowed with the most surpassing"
3283,BOOK VI.,"comeliness and beauty. But Proetus devised his ruin, and being"
3284,BOOK VI.,"stronger than he, drove him from the land of the Argives, over"
3285,BOOK VI.,"which Jove had made him ruler. For Antea, wife of Proetus, lusted"
3286,BOOK VI.,"after him, and would have had him lie with her in secret; but"
3287,BOOK VI.,"Bellerophon was an honourable man and would not, so she told lies"
3288,BOOK VI.,"about him to Proetus. ‘Proetus,’ said she, ‘kill Bellerophon or"
3289,BOOK VI.,"die, for he would have had converse with me against my will.’ The"
3290,BOOK VI.,"king was angered, but shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent"
3291,BOOK VI.,"him to Lycia with lying letters of introduction, written on a"
3292,BOOK VI.,"folded tablet, and containing much ill against the bearer. He"
3293,BOOK VI.,"bade Bellerophon show these letters to his father-in-law, to the"
3294,BOOK VI.,end that he might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore went to
3295,BOOK VI.,"Lycia, and the gods convoyed him safely."
3296,BOOK VI.,
3297,BOOK VI.,"“When he reached the river Xanthus, which is in Lycia, the king"
3298,BOOK VI.,"received him with all goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed"
3299,BOOK VI.,"nine heifers in his honour, but when rosy-fingered morning"
3300,BOOK VI.,"appeared upon the tenth day, he questioned him and desired to see"
3301,BOOK VI.,the letter from his son-in-law Proetus. When he had received the
3302,BOOK VI.,wicked letter he first commanded Bellerophon to kill that savage
3303,BOOK VI.,"monster, the Chimaera, who was not a human being, but a goddess,"
3304,BOOK VI.,"for she had the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent, while"
3305,BOOK VI.,"her body was that of a goat, and she breathed forth flames of"
3306,BOOK VI.,"fire; but Bellerophon slew her, for he was guided by signs from"
3307,BOOK VI.,"heaven. He next fought the far-famed Solymi, and this, he said,"
3308,BOOK VI.,"was the hardest of all his battles. Thirdly, he killed the"
3309,BOOK VI.,"Amazons, women who were the peers of men, and as he was returning"
3310,BOOK VI.,thence the king devised yet another plan for his destruction; he
3311,BOOK VI.,"picked the bravest warriors in all Lycia, and placed them in"
3312,BOOK VI.,"ambuscade, but not a man ever came back, for Bellerophon killed"
3313,BOOK VI.,every one of them. Then the king knew that he must be the valiant
3314,BOOK VI.,"offspring of a god, so he kept him in Lycia, gave him his"
3315,BOOK VI.,"daughter in marriage, and made him of equal honour in the kingdom"
3316,BOOK VI.,"with himself; and the Lycians gave him a piece of land, the best"
3317,BOOK VI.,"in all the country, fair with vineyards and tilled fields, to"
3318,BOOK VI.,have and to hold.
3319,BOOK VI.,
3320,BOOK VI.,"“The king’s daughter bore Bellerophon three children, Isander,"
3321,BOOK VI.,"Hippolochus, and Laodameia. Jove, the lord of counsel, lay with"
3322,BOOK VI.,"Laodameia, and she bore him noble Sarpedon; but when Bellerophon"
3323,BOOK VI.,"came to be hated by all the gods, he wandered all desolate and"
3324,BOOK VI.,"dismayed upon the Alean plain, gnawing at his own heart, and"
3325,BOOK VI.,"shunning the path of man. Mars, insatiate of battle, killed his"
3326,BOOK VI.,son Isander while he was fighting the Solymi; his daughter was
3327,BOOK VI.,"killed by Diana of the golden reins, for she was angered with"
3328,BOOK VI.,"her; but Hippolochus was father to myself, and when he sent me to"
3329,BOOK VI.,Troy he urged me again and again to fight ever among the foremost
3330,BOOK VI.,"and outvie my peers, so as not to shame the blood of my fathers"
3331,BOOK VI.,"who were the noblest in Ephyra and in all Lycia. This, then, is"
3332,BOOK VI.,the descent I claim.”
3333,BOOK VI.,
3334,BOOK VI.,"Thus did he speak, and the heart of Diomed was glad. He planted"
3335,BOOK VI.,"his spear in the ground, and spoke to him with friendly words."
3336,BOOK VI.,"“Then,” he said, “you are an old friend of my father’s house."
3337,BOOK VI.,"Great Oeneus once entertained Bellerophon for twenty days, and"
3338,BOOK VI.,"the two exchanged presents. Oeneus gave a belt rich with purple,"
3339,BOOK VI.,"and Bellerophon a double cup, which I left at home when I set out"
3340,BOOK VI.,"for Troy. I do not remember Tydeus, for he was taken from us"
3341,BOOK VI.,"while I was yet a child, when the army of the Achaeans was cut to"
3342,BOOK VI.,"pieces before Thebes. Henceforth, however, I must be your host in"
3343,BOOK VI.,"middle Argos, and you mine in Lycia, if I should ever go there;"
3344,BOOK VI.,let us avoid one another’s spears even during a general
3345,BOOK VI.,engagement; there are many noble Trojans and allies whom I can
3346,BOOK VI.,"kill, if I overtake them and heaven delivers them into my hand;"
3347,BOOK VI.,"so again with yourself, there are many Achaeans whose lives you"
3348,BOOK VI.,"may take if you can; we two, then, will exchange armour, that all"
3349,BOOK VI.,present may know of the old ties that subsist between us.”
3350,BOOK VI.,
3351,BOOK VI.,"With these words they sprang from their chariots, grasped one"
3352,BOOK VI.,"another’s hands, and plighted friendship. But the son of Saturn"
3353,BOOK VI.,"made Glaucus take leave of his wits, for he exchanged golden"
3354,BOOK VI.,"armour for bronze, the worth of a hundred head of cattle for the"
3355,BOOK VI.,worth of nine.
3356,BOOK VI.,
3357,BOOK VI.,"Now when Hector reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, the"
3358,BOOK VI.,wives and daughters of the Trojans came running towards him to
3359,BOOK VI.,"ask after their sons, brothers, kinsmen, and husbands: he told"
3360,BOOK VI.,"them to set about praying to the gods, and many were made"
3361,BOOK VI.,sorrowful as they heard him.
3362,BOOK VI.,
3363,BOOK VI.,"Presently he reached the splendid palace of King Priam, adorned"
3364,BOOK VI.,with colonnades of hewn stone. In it there were fifty
3365,BOOK VI.,"bedchambers—all of hewn stone—built near one another, where the"
3366,BOOK VI.,"sons of Priam slept, each with his wedded wife. Opposite these,"
3367,BOOK VI.,"on the other side the courtyard, there were twelve upper rooms"
3368,BOOK VI.,"also of hewn stone for Priam’s daughters, built near one another,"
3369,BOOK VI.,where his sons-in-law slept with their wives. When Hector got
3370,BOOK VI.,"there, his fond mother came up to him with Laodice the fairest of"
3371,BOOK VI.,"her daughters. She took his hand within her own and said, “My"
3372,BOOK VI.,"son, why have you left the battle to come hither? Are the"
3373,BOOK VI.,"Achaeans, woe betide them, pressing you hard about the city that"
3374,BOOK VI.,you have thought fit to come and uplift your hands to Jove from
3375,BOOK VI.,the citadel? Wait till I can bring you wine that you may make
3376,BOOK VI.,"offering to Jove and to the other immortals, and may then drink"
3377,BOOK VI.,and be refreshed. Wine gives a man fresh strength when he is
3378,BOOK VI.,"wearied, as you now are with fighting on behalf of your kinsmen.”"
3379,BOOK VI.,
3380,BOOK VI.,"And Hector answered, “Honoured mother, bring no wine, lest you"
3381,BOOK VI.,unman me and I forget my strength. I dare not make a
3382,BOOK VI.,drink-offering to Jove with unwashed hands; one who is
3383,BOOK VI.,bespattered with blood and filth may not pray to the son of
3384,BOOK VI.,"Saturn. Get the matrons together, and go with offerings to the"
3385,BOOK VI.,"temple of Minerva driver of the spoil; there, upon the knees of"
3386,BOOK VI.,"Minerva, lay the largest and fairest robe you have in your"
3387,BOOK VI.,"house—the one you set most store by; promise, moreover, to"
3388,BOOK VI.,sacrifice twelve yearling heifers that have never yet felt the
3389,BOOK VI.,"goad, in the temple of the goddess if she will take pity on the"
3390,BOOK VI.,"town, with the wives and little ones of the Trojans, and keep the"
3391,BOOK VI.,"son of Tydeus from off the goodly city of Ilius, for he fights"
3392,BOOK VI.,"with fury, and fills men’s souls with panic. Go, then, to the"
3393,BOOK VI.,"temple of Minerva, while I seek Paris and exhort him, if he will"
3394,BOOK VI.,hear my words. Would that the earth might open her jaws and
3395,BOOK VI.,"swallow him, for Jove bred him to be the bane of the Trojans, and"
3396,BOOK VI.,of Priam and Priam’s sons. Could I but see him go down into the
3397,BOOK VI.,"house of Hades, my heart would forget its heaviness.”"
3398,BOOK VI.,
3399,BOOK VI.,His mother went into the house and called her waiting-women who
3400,BOOK VI.,gathered the matrons throughout the city. She then went down into
3401,BOOK VI.,"her fragrant store-room, where her embroidered robes were kept,"
3402,BOOK VI.,"the work of Sidonian women, whom Alexandrus had brought over from"
3403,BOOK VI.,Sidon when he sailed the seas upon that voyage during which he
3404,BOOK VI.,"carried off Helen. Hecuba took out the largest robe, and the one"
3405,BOOK VI.,"that was most beautifully enriched with embroidery, as an"
3406,BOOK VI.,"offering to Minerva: it glittered like a star, and lay at the"
3407,BOOK VI.,very bottom of the chest. With this she went on her way and many
3408,BOOK VI.,matrons with her.
3409,BOOK VI.,
3410,BOOK VI.,"When they reached the temple of Minerva, lovely Theano, daughter"
3411,BOOK VI.,"of Cisseus and wife of Antenor, opened the doors, for the Trojans"
3412,BOOK VI.,had made her priestess of Minerva. The women lifted up their
3413,BOOK VI.,"hands to the goddess with a loud cry, and Theano took the robe to"
3414,BOOK VI.,"lay it upon the knees of Minerva, praying the while to the"
3415,BOOK VI.,"daughter of great Jove. “Holy Minerva,” she cried, “protectress"
3416,BOOK VI.,"of our city, mighty goddess, break the spear of Diomed and lay"
3417,BOOK VI.,"him low before the Scaean gates. Do this, and we will sacrifice"
3418,BOOK VI.,"twelve heifers that have never yet known the goad, in your"
3419,BOOK VI.,"temple, if you will have pity upon the town, with the wives and"
3420,BOOK VI.,"little ones of the Trojans.” Thus she prayed, but Pallas Minerva"
3421,BOOK VI.,granted not her prayer.
3422,BOOK VI.,
3423,BOOK VI.,"While they were thus praying to the daughter of great Jove,"
3424,BOOK VI.,"Hector went to the fair house of Alexandrus, which he had built"
3425,BOOK VI.,for him by the foremost builders in the land. They had built him
3426,BOOK VI.,"his house, storehouse, and courtyard near those of Priam and"
3427,BOOK VI.,"Hector on the acropolis. Here Hector entered, with a spear eleven"
3428,BOOK VI.,cubits long in his hand; the bronze point gleamed in front of
3429,BOOK VI.,"him, and was fastened to the shaft of the spear by a ring of"
3430,BOOK VI.,"gold. He found Alexandrus within the house, busied about his"
3431,BOOK VI.,"armour, his shield and cuirass, and handling his curved bow;"
3432,BOOK VI.,"there, too, sat Argive Helen with her women, setting them their"
3433,BOOK VI.,several tasks; and as Hector saw him he rebuked him with words of
3434,BOOK VI.,"scorn. “Sir,” said he, “you do ill to nurse this rancour; the"
3435,BOOK VI.,people perish fighting round this our town; you would yourself
3436,BOOK VI.,"chide one whom you saw shirking his part in the combat. Up then,"
3437,BOOK VI.,or ere long the city will be in a blaze.”
3438,BOOK VI.,
3439,BOOK VI.,"And Alexandrus answered, “Hector, your rebuke is just; listen"
3440,BOOK VI.,"therefore, and believe me when I tell you that I am not here so"
3441,BOOK VI.,"much through rancour or ill-will towards the Trojans, as from a"
3442,BOOK VI.,desire to indulge my grief. My wife was even now gently urging me
3443,BOOK VI.,"to battle, and I hold it better that I should go, for victory is"
3444,BOOK VI.,"ever fickle. Wait, then, while I put on my armour, or go first"
3445,BOOK VI.,and I will follow. I shall be sure to overtake you.”
3446,BOOK VI.,
3447,BOOK VI.,"Hector made no answer, but Helen tried to soothe him. “Brother,”"
3448,BOOK VI.,"said she, “to my abhorred and sinful self, would that a whirlwind"
3449,BOOK VI.,"had caught me up on the day my mother brought me forth, and had"
3450,BOOK VI.,borne me to some mountain or to the waves of the roaring sea that
3451,BOOK VI.,"should have swept me away ere this mischief had come about. But,"
3452,BOOK VI.,"since the gods have devised these evils, would, at any rate, that"
3453,BOOK VI.,I had been wife to a better man—to one who could smart under
3454,BOOK VI.,dishonour and men’s evil speeches. This fellow was never yet to
3455,BOOK VI.,"be depended upon, nor never will be, and he will surely reap what"
3456,BOOK VI.,"he has sown. Still, brother, come in and rest upon this seat, for"
3457,BOOK VI.,it is you who bear the brunt of that toil that has been caused by
3458,BOOK VI.,my hateful self and by the sin of Alexandrus—both of whom Jove
3459,BOOK VI.,has doomed to be a theme of song among those that shall be born
3460,BOOK VI.,hereafter.”
3461,BOOK VI.,
3462,BOOK VI.,"And Hector answered, “Bid me not be seated, Helen, for all the"
3463,BOOK VI.,goodwill you bear me. I cannot stay. I am in haste to help the
3464,BOOK VI.,"Trojans, who miss me greatly when I am not among them; but urge"
3465,BOOK VI.,"your husband, and of his own self also let him make haste to"
3466,BOOK VI.,overtake me before I am out of the city. I must go home to see my
3467,BOOK VI.,"household, my wife and my little son, for I know not whether I"
3468,BOOK VI.,"shall ever again return to them, or whether the gods will cause"
3469,BOOK VI.,me to fall by the hands of the Achaeans.”
3470,BOOK VI.,
3471,BOOK VI.,"Then Hector left her, and forthwith was at his own house. He did"
3472,BOOK VI.,"not find Andromache, for she was on the wall with her child and"
3473,BOOK VI.,"one of her maids, weeping bitterly. Seeing, then, that she was"
3474,BOOK VI.,"not within, he stood on the threshold of the women’s rooms and"
3475,BOOK VI.,"said, “Women, tell me, and tell me true, where did Andromache go"
3476,BOOK VI.,"when she left the house? Was it to my sisters, or to my brothers’"
3477,BOOK VI.,wives? or is she at the temple of Minerva where the other women
3478,BOOK VI.,are propitiating the awful goddess?”
3479,BOOK VI.,
3480,BOOK VI.,"His good housekeeper answered, “Hector, since you bid me tell you"
3481,BOOK VI.,"truly, she did not go to your sisters nor to your brothers’"
3482,BOOK VI.,"wives, nor yet to the temple of Minerva, where the other women"
3483,BOOK VI.,"are propitiating the awful goddess, but she is on the high wall"
3484,BOOK VI.,"of Ilius, for she had heard the Trojans were being hard pressed,"
3485,BOOK VI.,and that the Achaeans were in great force: she went to the wall
3486,BOOK VI.,"in frenzied haste, and the nurse went with her carrying the"
3487,BOOK VI.,child.”
3488,BOOK VI.,
3489,BOOK VI.,"Hector hurried from the house when she had done speaking, and"
3490,BOOK VI.,went down the streets by the same way that he had come. When he
3491,BOOK VI.,had gone through the city and had reached the Scaean gates
3492,BOOK VI.,"through which he would go out on to the plain, his wife came"
3493,BOOK VI.,"running towards him, Andromache, daughter of great Eetion who"
3494,BOOK VI.,"ruled in Thebe under the wooded slopes of Mt. Placus, and was"
3495,BOOK VI.,"king of the Cilicians. His daughter had married Hector, and now"
3496,BOOK VI.,came to meet him with a nurse who carried his little child in her
3497,BOOK VI.,"bosom—a mere babe. Hector’s darling son, and lovely as a star."
3498,BOOK VI.,"Hector had named him Scamandrius, but the people called him"
3499,BOOK VI.,"Astyanax, for his father stood alone as chief guardian of Ilius."
3500,BOOK VI.,"Hector smiled as he looked upon the boy, but he did not speak,"
3501,BOOK VI.,and Andromache stood by him weeping and taking his hand in her
3502,BOOK VI.,"own. “Dear husband,” said she, “your valour will bring you to"
3503,BOOK VI.,"destruction; think on your infant son, and on my hapless self who"
3504,BOOK VI.,ere long shall be your widow—for the Achaeans will set upon you
3505,BOOK VI.,"in a body and kill you. It would be better for me, should I lose"
3506,BOOK VI.,"you, to lie dead and buried, for I shall have nothing left to"
3507,BOOK VI.,"comfort me when you are gone, save only sorrow. I have neither"
3508,BOOK VI.,father nor mother now. Achilles slew my father when he sacked
3509,BOOK VI.,"Thebe the goodly city of the Cilicians. He slew him, but did not"
3510,BOOK VI.,for very shame despoil him; when he had burned him in his
3511,BOOK VI.,"wondrous armour, he raised a barrow over his ashes and the"
3512,BOOK VI.,"mountain nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing Jove, planted a grove"
3513,BOOK VI.,of elms about his tomb. I had seven brothers in my father’s
3514,BOOK VI.,"house, but on the same day they all went within the house of"
3515,BOOK VI.,Hades. Achilles killed them as they were with their sheep and
3516,BOOK VI.,cattle. My mother—her who had been queen of all the land under
3517,BOOK VI.,"Mt. Placus—he brought hither with the spoil, and freed her for a"
3518,BOOK VI.,"great sum, but the archer-queen Diana took her in the house of"
3519,BOOK VI.,"your father. Nay—Hector—you who to me are father, mother,"
3520,BOOK VI.,"brother, and dear husband—have mercy upon me; stay here upon this"
3521,BOOK VI.,"wall; make not your child fatherless, and your wife a widow; as"
3522,BOOK VI.,"for the host, place them near the fig-tree, where the city can be"
3523,BOOK VI.,"best scaled, and the wall is weakest. Thrice have the bravest of"
3524,BOOK VI.,"them come thither and assailed it, under the two Ajaxes,"
3525,BOOK VI.,"Idomeneus, the sons of Atreus, and the brave son of Tydeus,"
3526,BOOK VI.,"either of their own bidding, or because some soothsayer had told"
3527,BOOK VI.,them.”
3528,BOOK VI.,
3529,BOOK VI.,"And Hector answered, “Wife, I too have thought upon all this, but"
3530,BOOK VI.,"with what face should I look upon the Trojans, men or women, if I"
3531,BOOK VI.,shirked battle like a coward? I cannot do so: I know nothing save
3532,BOOK VI.,to fight bravely in the forefront of the Trojan host and win
3533,BOOK VI.,renown alike for my father and myself. Well do I know that the
3534,BOOK VI.,day will surely come when mighty Ilius shall be destroyed with
3535,BOOK VI.,"Priam and Priam’s people, but I grieve for none of these—not even"
3536,BOOK VI.,"for Hecuba, nor King Priam, nor for my brothers many and brave"
3537,BOOK VI.,who may fall in the dust before their foes—for none of these do I
3538,BOOK VI.,grieve as for yourself when the day shall come on which some one
3539,BOOK VI.,"of the Achaeans shall rob you for ever of your freedom, and bear"
3540,BOOK VI.,you weeping away. It may be that you will have to ply the loom in
3541,BOOK VI.,"Argos at the bidding of a mistress, or to fetch water from the"
3542,BOOK VI.,"springs Messeis or Hypereia, treated brutally by some cruel"
3543,BOOK VI.,"task-master; then will one say who sees you weeping, ‘She was"
3544,BOOK VI.,"wife to Hector, the bravest warrior among the Trojans during the"
3545,BOOK VI.,war before Ilius.’ On this your tears will break forth anew for
3546,BOOK VI.,him who would have put away the day of captivity from you. May I
3547,BOOK VI.,lie dead under the barrow that is heaped over my body ere I hear
3548,BOOK VI.,your cry as they carry you into bondage.”
3549,BOOK VI.,
3550,BOOK VI.,"He stretched his arms towards his child, but the boy cried and"
3551,BOOK VI.,"nestled in his nurse’s bosom, scared at the sight of his father’s"
3552,BOOK VI.,"armour, and at the horse-hair plume that nodded fiercely from his"
3553,BOOK VI.,"helmet. His father and mother laughed to see him, but Hector took"
3554,BOOK VI.,the helmet from his head and laid it all gleaming upon the
3555,BOOK VI.,"ground. Then he took his darling child, kissed him, and dandled"
3556,BOOK VI.,"him in his arms, praying over him the while to Jove and to all"
3557,BOOK VI.,"the gods. “Jove,” he cried, “grant that this my child may be even"
3558,BOOK VI.,"as myself, chief among the Trojans; let him be not less excellent"
3559,BOOK VI.,"in strength, and let him rule Ilius with his might. Then may one"
3560,BOOK VI.,"say of him as he comes from battle, ‘The son is far better than"
3561,BOOK VI.,the father.’ May he bring back the blood-stained spoils of him
3562,BOOK VI.,"whom he has laid low, and let his mother’s heart be glad.”"
3563,BOOK VI.,
3564,BOOK VI.,"With this he laid the child again in the arms of his wife, who"
3565,BOOK VI.,"took him to her own soft bosom, smiling through her tears. As her"
3566,BOOK VI.,husband watched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressed
3567,BOOK VI.,"her fondly, saying, “My own wife, do not take these things too"
3568,BOOK VI.,bitterly to heart. No one can hurry me down to Hades before my
3569,BOOK VI.,"time, but if a man’s hour is come, be he brave or be he coward,"
3570,BOOK VI.,"there is no escape for him when he has once been born. Go, then,"
3571,BOOK VI.,"within the house, and busy yourself with your daily duties, your"
3572,BOOK VI.,"loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for war is"
3573,BOOK VI.,"man’s matter, and mine above all others of them that have been"
3574,BOOK VI.,born in Ilius.”
3575,BOOK VI.,
3576,BOOK VI.,"He took his plumed helmet from the ground, and his wife went back"
3577,BOOK VI.,"again to her house, weeping bitterly and often looking back"
3578,BOOK VI.,towards him. When she reached her home she found her maidens
3579,BOOK VI.,"within, and bade them all join in her lament; so they mourned"
3580,BOOK VI.,"Hector in his own house though he was yet alive, for they deemed"
3581,BOOK VI.,"that they should never see him return safe from battle, and from"
3582,BOOK VI.,the furious hands of the Achaeans.
3583,BOOK VI.,
3584,BOOK VI.,Paris did not remain long in his house. He donned his goodly
3585,BOOK VI.,"armour overlaid with bronze, and hasted through the city as fast"
3586,BOOK VI.,"as his feet could take him. As a horse, stabled and fed, breaks"
3587,BOOK VI.,loose and gallops gloriously over the plain to the place where he
3588,BOOK VI.,is wont to bathe in the fair-flowing river—he holds his head
3589,BOOK VI.,"high, and his mane streams upon his shoulders as he exults in his"
3590,BOOK VI.,strength and flies like the wind to the haunts and feeding ground
3591,BOOK VI.,"of the mares—even so went forth Paris from high Pergamus,"
3592,BOOK VI.,"gleaming like sunlight in his armour, and he laughed aloud as he"
3593,BOOK VI.,sped swiftly on his way. Forthwith he came upon his brother
3594,BOOK VI.,"Hector, who was then turning away from the place where he had"
3595,BOOK VI.,"held converse with his wife, and he was himself the first to"
3596,BOOK VI.,"speak. “Sir,” said he, “I fear that I have kept you waiting when"
3597,BOOK VI.,"you are in haste, and have not come as quickly as you bade me.”"
3598,BOOK VI.,
3599,BOOK VI.,"“My good brother,” answered Hector, “you fight bravely, and no"
3600,BOOK VI.,man with any justice can make light of your doings in battle. But
3601,BOOK VI.,you are careless and wilfully remiss. It grieves me to the heart
3602,BOOK VI.,"to hear the ill that the Trojans speak about you, for they have"
3603,BOOK VI.,"suffered much on your account. Let us be going, and we will make"
3604,BOOK VI.,"things right hereafter, should Jove vouchsafe us to set the cup"
3605,BOOK VI.,of our deliverance before ever-living gods of heaven in our own
3606,BOOK VI.,"homes, when we have chased the Achaeans from Troy.”"
3607,BOOK VI.,
3608,BOOK VI.,
3609,BOOK VI.,
3610,BOOK VI.,
3611,BOOK VII.,BOOK VII.
3612,BOOK VII.,
3613,BOOK VII.,
3614,BOOK VII.,Hector and Ajax fight—Hector is getting worsted when night comes
3615,BOOK VII.,"on and parts them—They exchange presents—The burial of the dead,"
3616,BOOK VII.,and the building of a wall round their ships by the Achaeans—The
3617,BOOK VII.,Achaeans buy their wine of Agamemnon and Menelaus.
3618,BOOK VII.,
3619,BOOK VII.,"With these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brother"
3620,BOOK VII.,"Alexandrus with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven"
3621,BOOK VII.,"sends a breeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain,"
3622,BOOK VII.,"and have laboured at their oars till they are faint with toil,"
3623,BOOK VII.,even so welcome was the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans.
3624,BOOK VII.,
3625,BOOK VII.,Thereon Alexandrus killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; he
3626,BOOK VII.,"lived in Arne, and was son of Areithous the Mace-man, and of"
3627,BOOK VII.,Phylomedusa. Hector threw a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead
3628,BOOK VII.,with a wound in the neck under the bronze rim of his helmet.
3629,BOOK VII.,"Glaucus, moreover, son of Hippolochus, captain of the Lycians, in"
3630,BOOK VII.,hard hand-to-hand fight smote Iphinous son of Dexius on the
3631,BOOK VII.,"shoulder, as he was springing on to his chariot behind his fleet"
3632,BOOK VII.,"mares; so he fell to earth from the car, and there was no life"
3633,BOOK VII.,left in him.
3634,BOOK VII.,
3635,BOOK VII.,"When, therefore, Minerva saw these men making havoc of the"
3636,BOOK VII.,"Argives, she darted down to Ilius from the summits of Olympus,"
3637,BOOK VII.,"and Apollo, who was looking on from Pergamus, went out to meet"
3638,BOOK VII.,her; for he wanted the Trojans to be victorious. The pair met by
3639,BOOK VII.,"the oak tree, and King Apollo son of Jove was first to speak."
3640,BOOK VII.,"“What would you have,” said he, “daughter of great Jove, that"
3641,BOOK VII.,your proud spirit has sent you hither from Olympus? Have you no
3642,BOOK VII.,"pity upon the Trojans, and would you incline the scales of"
3643,BOOK VII.,victory in favour of the Danaans? Let me persuade you—for it will
3644,BOOK VII.,"be better thus—stay the combat for to-day, but let them renew the"
3645,BOOK VII.,"fight hereafter till they compass the doom of Ilius, since you"
3646,BOOK VII.,goddesses have made up your minds to destroy the city.”
3647,BOOK VII.,
3648,BOOK VII.,"And Minerva answered, “So be it, Far-Darter; it was in this mind"
3649,BOOK VII.,that I came down from Olympus to the Trojans and Achaeans. Tell
3650,BOOK VII.,"me, then, how do you propose to end this present fighting?”"
3651,BOOK VII.,
3652,BOOK VII.,"Apollo, son of Jove, replied, “Let us incite great Hector to"
3653,BOOK VII.,challenge some one of the Danaans in single combat; on this the
3654,BOOK VII.,Achaeans will be shamed into finding a man who will fight him.”
3655,BOOK VII.,
3656,BOOK VII.,"Minerva assented, and Helenus son of Priam divined the counsel of"
3657,BOOK VII.,"the gods; he therefore went up to Hector and said, “Hector son of"
3658,BOOK VII.,"Priam, peer of gods in counsel, I am your brother, let me then"
3659,BOOK VII.,persuade you. Bid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them take
3660,BOOK VII.,"their seats, and challenge the best man among the Achaeans to"
3661,BOOK VII.,meet you in single combat. I have heard the voice of the
3662,BOOK VII.,"ever-living gods, and the hour of your doom is not yet come.”"
3663,BOOK VII.,
3664,BOOK VII.,"Hector was glad when he heard this saying, and went in among the"
3665,BOOK VII.,"Trojans, grasping his spear by the middle to hold them back, and"
3666,BOOK VII.,they all sat down. Agamemnon also bade the Achaeans be seated.
3667,BOOK VII.,"But Minerva and Apollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on"
3668,BOOK VII.,"father Jove’s high oak tree, proud of their men; and the ranks"
3669,BOOK VII.,"sat close ranged together, bristling with shield and helmet and"
3670,BOOK VII.,spear. As when the rising west wind furs the face of the sea and
3671,BOOK VII.,"the waters grow dark beneath it, so sat the companies of Trojans"
3672,BOOK VII.,and Achaeans upon the plain. And Hector spoke thus:—
3673,BOOK VII.,
3674,BOOK VII.,"“Hear me, Trojans and Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am"
3675,BOOK VII.,minded; Jove on his high throne has brought our oaths and
3676,BOOK VII.,"covenants to nothing, and foreshadows ill for both of us, till"
3677,BOOK VII.,"you either take the towers of Troy, or are yourselves vanquished"
3678,BOOK VII.,at your ships. The princes of the Achaeans are here present in
3679,BOOK VII.,"the midst of you; let him, then, that will fight me stand forward"
3680,BOOK VII.,"as your champion against Hector. Thus I say, and may Jove be"
3681,BOOK VII.,"witness between us. If your champion slay me, let him strip me of"
3682,BOOK VII.,"my armour and take it to your ships, but let him send my body"
3683,BOOK VII.,home that the Trojans and their wives may give me my dues of fire
3684,BOOK VII.,"when I am dead. In like manner, if Apollo vouchsafe me glory and"
3685,BOOK VII.,"I slay your champion, I will strip him of his armour and take it"
3686,BOOK VII.,"to the city of Ilius, where I will hang it in the temple of"
3687,BOOK VII.,"Apollo, but I will give up his body, that the Achaeans may bury"
3688,BOOK VII.,"him at their ships, and then build him a mound by the wide waters"
3689,BOOK VII.,of the Hellespont. Then will one say hereafter as he sails his
3690,BOOK VII.,"ship over the sea, ‘This is the monument of one who died long"
3691,BOOK VII.,since a champion who was slain by mighty Hector.’ Thus will one
3692,BOOK VII.,"say, and my fame shall not be lost.”"
3693,BOOK VII.,
3694,BOOK VII.,"Thus did he speak, but they all held their peace, ashamed to"
3695,BOOK VII.,"decline the challenge, yet fearing to accept it, till at last"
3696,BOOK VII.,"Menelaus rose and rebuked them, for he was angry. “Alas,” he"
3697,BOOK VII.,"cried, “vain braggarts, women forsooth not men, double-dyed"
3698,BOOK VII.,indeed will be the stain upon us if no man of the Danaans will
3699,BOOK VII.,now face Hector. May you be turned every man of you into earth
3700,BOOK VII.,and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious in your places. I
3701,BOOK VII.,"will myself go out against this man, but the upshot of the fight"
3702,BOOK VII.,will be from on high in the hands of the immortal gods.”
3703,BOOK VII.,
3704,BOOK VII.,"With these words he put on his armour; and then, O Menelaus, your"
3705,BOOK VII.,"life would have come to an end at the hands of hands of Hector,"
3706,BOOK VII.,"for he was far better the man, had not the princes of the"
3707,BOOK VII.,Achaeans sprung upon you and checked you. King Agamemnon caught
3708,BOOK VII.,"him by the right hand and said, “Menelaus, you are mad; a truce"
3709,BOOK VII.,"to this folly. Be patient in spite of passion, do not think of"
3710,BOOK VII.,fighting a man so much stronger than yourself as Hector son of
3711,BOOK VII.,"Priam, who is feared by many another as well as you. Even"
3712,BOOK VII.,"Achilles, who is far more doughty than you are, shrank from"
3713,BOOK VII.,"meeting him in battle. Sit down your own people, and the Achaeans"
3714,BOOK VII.,will send some other champion to fight Hector; fearless and fond
3715,BOOK VII.,"of battle though he be, I ween his knees will bend gladly under"
3716,BOOK VII.,him if he comes out alive from the hurly-burly of this fight.”
3717,BOOK VII.,
3718,BOOK VII.,"With these words of reasonable counsel he persuaded his brother,"
3719,BOOK VII.,whereon his squires gladly stripped the armour from off his
3720,BOOK VII.,"shoulders. Then Nestor rose and spoke, “Of a truth,” said he,"
3721,BOOK VII.,“the Achaean land is fallen upon evil times. The old knight
3722,BOOK VII.,"Peleus, counsellor and orator among the Myrmidons, loved when I"
3723,BOOK VII.,was in his house to question me concerning the race and lineage
3724,BOOK VII.,of all the Argives. How would it not grieve him could he hear of
3725,BOOK VII.,them as now quailing before Hector? Many a time would he lift his
3726,BOOK VII.,hands in prayer that his soul might leave his body and go down
3727,BOOK VII.,"within the house of Hades. Would, by father Jove, Minerva, and"
3728,BOOK VII.,"Apollo, that I were still young and strong as when the Pylians"
3729,BOOK VII.,and Arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid river Celadon
3730,BOOK VII.,"under the walls of Pheia, and round about the waters of the river"
3731,BOOK VII.,Iardanus. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood forward as their
3732,BOOK VII.,"champion, with the armour of King Areithous upon his"
3733,BOOK VII.,shoulders—Areithous whom men and women had surnamed ‘the
3734,BOOK VII.,"Mace-man,’ because he fought neither with bow nor spear, but"
3735,BOOK VII.,broke the battalions of the foe with his iron mace. Lycurgus
3736,BOOK VII.,"killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him in a narrow"
3737,BOOK VII.,way where his mace served him in no stead; for Lycurgus was too
3738,BOOK VII.,"quick for him and speared him through the middle, so he fell to"
3739,BOOK VII.,earth on his back. Lycurgus then spoiled him of the armour which
3740,BOOK VII.,"Mars had given him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but when"
3741,BOOK VII.,"he grew old and stayed at home, he gave it to his faithful squire"
3742,BOOK VII.,"Ereuthalion, who in this same armour challenged the foremost men"
3743,BOOK VII.,"among us. The others quaked and quailed, but my high spirit bade"
3744,BOOK VII.,me fight him though none other would venture; I was the youngest
3745,BOOK VII.,man of them all; but when I fought him Minerva vouchsafed me
3746,BOOK VII.,"victory. He was the biggest and strongest man that ever I killed,"
3747,BOOK VII.,and covered much ground as he lay sprawling upon the earth. Would
3748,BOOK VII.,"that I were still young and strong as I then was, for the son of"
3749,BOOK VII.,"Priam would then soon find one who would face him. But you,"
3750,BOOK VII.,"foremost among the whole host though you be, have none of you any"
3751,BOOK VII.,stomach for fighting Hector.”
3752,BOOK VII.,
3753,BOOK VII.,"Thus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith nine men started"
3754,BOOK VII.,"to their feet. Foremost of all uprose King Agamemnon, and after"
3755,BOOK VII.,"him brave Diomed the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men"
3756,BOOK VII.,"clothed in valour as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and"
3757,BOOK VII.,Meriones his brother in arms. After these Eurypylus son of
3758,BOOK VII.,"Euaemon, Thoas the son of Andraemon, and Ulysses also rose. Then"
3759,BOOK VII.,"Nestor knight of Gerene again spoke, saying: “Cast lots among you"
3760,BOOK VII.,to see who shall be chosen. If he come alive out of this fight he
3761,BOOK VII.,will have done good service alike to his own soul and to the
3762,BOOK VII.,Achaeans.”
3763,BOOK VII.,
3764,BOOK VII.,"Thus he spoke, and when each of them had marked his lot, and had"
3765,BOOK VII.,"thrown it into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the people"
3766,BOOK VII.,"lifted their hands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as"
3767,BOOK VII.,"he looked into the vault of heaven, “Father Jove, grant that the"
3768,BOOK VII.,"lot fall on Ajax, or on the son of Tydeus, or upon the king of"
3769,BOOK VII.,rich Mycene himself.”
3770,BOOK VII.,
3771,BOOK VII.,"As they were speaking, Nestor knight of Gerene shook the helmet,"
3772,BOOK VII.,and from it there fell the very lot which they wanted—the lot of
3773,BOOK VII.,Ajax. The herald bore it about and showed it to all the
3774,BOOK VII.,"chieftains of the Achaeans, going from left to right; but they"
3775,BOOK VII.,"none of them owned it. When, however, in due course he reached"
3776,BOOK VII.,"the man who had written upon it and had put it into the helmet,"
3777,BOOK VII.,"brave Ajax held out his hand, and the herald gave him the lot."
3778,BOOK VII.,When Ajax saw his mark he knew it and was glad; he threw it to
3779,BOOK VII.,"the ground and said, “My friends, the lot is mine, and I rejoice,"
3780,BOOK VII.,"for I shall vanquish Hector. I will put on my armour; meanwhile,"
3781,BOOK VII.,pray to King Jove in silence among yourselves that the Trojans
3782,BOOK VII.,"may not hear you—or aloud if you will, for we fear no man. None"
3783,BOOK VII.,"shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for I was born"
3784,BOOK VII.,"and bred in Salamis, and can hold my own in all things.”"
3785,BOOK VII.,
3786,BOOK VII.,"With this they fell praying to King Jove the son of Saturn, and"
3787,BOOK VII.,"thus would one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven,"
3788,BOOK VII.,"“Father Jove that rulest from Ida, most glorious in power,"
3789,BOOK VII.,"vouchsafe victory to Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if"
3790,BOOK VII.,"you wish well to Hector also and would protect him, grant to each"
3791,BOOK VII.,of them equal fame and prowess.”
3792,BOOK VII.,
3793,BOOK VII.,"Thus they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming"
3794,BOOK VII.,bronze. When he was in full array he sprang forward as monstrous
3795,BOOK VII.,Mars when he takes part among men whom Jove has set fighting with
3796,BOOK VII.,"one another—even so did huge Ajax, bulwark of the Achaeans,"
3797,BOOK VII.,spring forward with a grim smile on his face as he brandished his
3798,BOOK VII.,long spear and strode onward. The Argives were elated as they
3799,BOOK VII.,"beheld him, but the Trojans trembled in every limb, and the heart"
3800,BOOK VII.,"even of Hector beat quickly, but he could not now retreat and"
3801,BOOK VII.,"withdraw into the ranks behind him, for he had been the"
3802,BOOK VII.,challenger. Ajax came up bearing his shield in front of him like
3803,BOOK VII.,a wall—a shield of bronze with seven folds of ox-hide—the work of
3804,BOOK VII.,"Tychius, who lived in Hyle and was by far the best worker in"
3805,BOOK VII.,"leather. He had made it with the hides of seven full-fed bulls,"
3806,BOOK VII.,and over these he had set an eighth layer of bronze. Holding this
3807,BOOK VII.,"shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to Hector,"
3808,BOOK VII.,"and menaced him saying, “Hector, you shall now learn, man to man,"
3809,BOOK VII.,what kind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides
3810,BOOK VII.,lion-hearted Achilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides
3811,BOOK VII.,"at the ships in anger with Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but"
3812,BOOK VII.,there are many of us who are well able to face you; therefore
3813,BOOK VII.,begin the fight.”
3814,BOOK VII.,
3815,BOOK VII.,"And Hector answered, “Noble Ajax, son of Telamon, captain of the"
3816,BOOK VII.,"host, treat me not as though I were some puny boy or woman that"
3817,BOOK VII.,cannot fight. I have been long used to the blood and butcheries
3818,BOOK VII.,of battle. I am quick to turn my leathern shield either to right
3819,BOOK VII.,"or left, for this I deem the main thing in battle. I can charge"
3820,BOOK VII.,"among the chariots and horsemen, and in hand to hand fighting can"
3821,BOOK VII.,delight the heart of Mars; howbeit I would not take such a man as
3822,BOOK VII.,you are off his guard—but I will smite you openly if I can.”
3823,BOOK VII.,
3824,BOOK VII.,"He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it from him. It"
3825,BOOK VII.,"struck the sevenfold shield in its outermost layer—the eighth,"
3826,BOOK VII.,which was of bronze—and went through six of the layers but in the
3827,BOOK VII.,"seventh hide it stayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck"
3828,BOOK VII.,the round shield of the son of Priam. The terrible spear went
3829,BOOK VII.,"through his gleaming shield, and pressed onward through his"
3830,BOOK VII.,cuirass of cunning workmanship; it pierced the shirt against his
3831,BOOK VII.,"side, but he swerved and thus saved his life. They then each of"
3832,BOOK VII.,"them drew out the spear from his shield, and fell on one another"
3833,BOOK VII.,like savage lions or wild boars of great strength and endurance:
3834,BOOK VII.,"the son of Priam struck the middle of Ajax’s shield, but the"
3835,BOOK VII.,"bronze did not break, and the point of his dart was turned. Ajax"
3836,BOOK VII.,then sprang forward and pierced the shield of Hector; the spear
3837,BOOK VII.,went through it and staggered him as he was springing forward to
3838,BOOK VII.,attack; it gashed his neck and the blood came pouring from the
3839,BOOK VII.,"wound, but even so Hector did not cease fighting; he gave ground,"
3840,BOOK VII.,"and with his brawny hand seized a stone, rugged and huge, that"
3841,BOOK VII.,was lying upon the plain; with this he struck the shield of Ajax
3842,BOOK VII.,"on the boss that was in its middle, so that the bronze rang"
3843,BOOK VII.,"again. But Ajax in turn caught up a far larger stone, swung it"
3844,BOOK VII.,"aloft, and hurled it with prodigious force. This millstone of a"
3845,BOOK VII.,rock broke Hector’s shield inwards and threw him down on his back
3846,BOOK VII.,"with the shield crushing him under it, but Apollo raised him at"
3847,BOOK VII.,once. Thereon they would have hacked at one another in close
3848,BOOK VII.,"combat with their swords, had not heralds, messengers of gods and"
3849,BOOK VII.,"men, come forward, one from the Trojans and the other from the"
3850,BOOK VII.,Achaeans—Talthybius and Idaeus both of them honourable men; these
3851,BOOK VII.,"parted them with their staves, and the good herald Idaeus said,"
3852,BOOK VII.,"“My sons, fight no longer, you are both of you valiant, and both"
3853,BOOK VII.,"are dear to Jove; we know this; but night is now falling, and the"
3854,BOOK VII.,behests of night may not be well gainsaid.”
3855,BOOK VII.,
3856,BOOK VII.,"Ajax son of Telamon answered, “Idaeus, bid Hector say so, for it"
3857,BOOK VII.,was he that challenged our princes. Let him speak first and I
3858,BOOK VII.,will accept his saying.”
3859,BOOK VII.,
3860,BOOK VII.,"Then Hector said, “Ajax, heaven has vouchsafed you stature and"
3861,BOOK VII.,"strength, and judgement; and in wielding the spear you excel all"
3862,BOOK VII.,others of the Achaeans. Let us for this day cease fighting;
3863,BOOK VII.,"hereafter we will fight anew till heaven decide between us, and"
3864,BOOK VII.,"give victory to one or to the other; night is now falling, and"
3865,BOOK VII.,"the behests of night may not be well gainsaid. Gladden, then, the"
3866,BOOK VII.,"hearts of the Achaeans at your ships, and more especially those"
3867,BOOK VII.,"of your own followers and clansmen, while I, in the great city of"
3868,BOOK VII.,"King Priam, bring comfort to the Trojans and their women, who vie"
3869,BOOK VII.,"with one another in their prayers on my behalf. Let us, moreover,"
3870,BOOK VII.,exchange presents that it may be said among the Achaeans and
3871,BOOK VII.,"Trojans, ‘They fought with might and main, but were reconciled"
3872,BOOK VII.,and parted in friendship.’”
3873,BOOK VII.,
3874,BOOK VII.,On this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword with its sheath and
3875,BOOK VII.,"leathern baldric, and in return Ajax gave him a girdle dyed with"
3876,BOOK VII.,"purple. Thus they parted, the one going to the host of the"
3877,BOOK VII.,"Achaeans, and the other to that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when"
3878,BOOK VII.,they saw their hero come to them safe and unharmed from the
3879,BOOK VII.,"strong hands of mighty Ajax. They led him, therefore, to the city"
3880,BOOK VII.,as one that had been saved beyond their hopes. On the other side
3881,BOOK VII.,the Achaeans brought Ajax elated with victory to Agamemnon.
3882,BOOK VII.,
3883,BOOK VII.,"When they reached the quarters of the son of Atreus, Agamemnon"
3884,BOOK VII.,sacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honour of Jove the
3885,BOOK VII.,"son of Saturn. They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and"
3886,BOOK VII.,divided it into joints; these they cut carefully up into smaller
3887,BOOK VII.,"pieces, putting them on the spits, roasting them sufficiently,"
3888,BOOK VII.,and then drawing them off. When they had done all this and had
3889,BOOK VII.,"prepared the feast, they ate it, and every man had his full and"
3890,BOOK VII.,"equal share, so that all were satisfied, and King Agamemnon gave"
3891,BOOK VII.,"Ajax some slices cut lengthways down the loin, as a mark of"
3892,BOOK VII.,"special honour. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,"
3893,BOOK VII.,old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest began to speak; with all
3894,BOOK VII.,"sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:—"
3895,BOOK VII.,
3896,BOOK VII.,"“Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch as many of the"
3897,BOOK VII.,"Achaeans are now dead, whose blood Mars has shed by the banks of"
3898,BOOK VII.,"the Scamander, and their souls have gone down to the house of"
3899,BOOK VII.,"Hades, it will be well when morning comes that we should cease"
3900,BOOK VII.,fighting; we will then wheel our dead together with oxen and
3901,BOOK VII.,"mules and burn them not far from the ships, that when we sail"
3902,BOOK VII.,hence we may take the bones of our comrades home to their
3903,BOOK VII.,children. Hard by the funeral pyre we will build a barrow that
3904,BOOK VII.,shall be raised from the plain for all in common; near this let
3905,BOOK VII.,"us set about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our"
3906,BOOK VII.,"ships, and let it have well-made gates that there may be a way"
3907,BOOK VII.,through them for our chariots. Close outside we will dig a deep
3908,BOOK VII.,"trench all round it to keep off both horse and foot, that the"
3909,BOOK VII.,Trojan chieftains may not bear hard upon us.”
3910,BOOK VII.,
3911,BOOK VII.,"Thus he spoke, and the princes shouted in applause. Meanwhile"
3912,BOOK VII.,"the Trojans held a council, angry and full of discord, on the"
3913,BOOK VII.,acropolis by the gates of King Priam’s palace; and wise Antenor
3914,BOOK VII.,"spoke. “Hear me,” he said, “Trojans, Dardanians, and allies, that"
3915,BOOK VII.,I may speak even as I am minded. Let us give up Argive Helen and
3916,BOOK VII.,"her wealth to the sons of Atreus, for we are now fighting in"
3917,BOOK VII.,"violation of our solemn covenants, and shall not prosper till we"
3918,BOOK VII.,have done as I say.”
3919,BOOK VII.,
3920,BOOK VII.,He then sat down and Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen rose to
3921,BOOK VII.,"speak. “Antenor,” said he, “your words are not to my liking; you"
3922,BOOK VII.,"can find a better saying than this if you will; if, however, you"
3923,BOOK VII.,"have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has heaven robbed you of"
3924,BOOK VII.,"your reason. I will speak plainly, and hereby notify to the"
3925,BOOK VII.,Trojans that I will not give up the woman; but the wealth that I
3926,BOOK VII.,"brought home with her from Argos I will restore, and will add yet"
3927,BOOK VII.,further of my own.”
3928,BOOK VII.,
3929,BOOK VII.,"On this, when Paris had spoken and taken his seat, Priam of the"
3930,BOOK VII.,"race of Dardanus, peer of gods in council, rose and with all"
3931,BOOK VII.,"sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus: “Hear me, Trojans,"
3932,BOOK VII.,"Dardanians, and allies, that I may speak even as I am minded. Get"
3933,BOOK VII.,"your suppers now as hitherto throughout the city, but keep your"
3934,BOOK VII.,"watches and be wakeful. At daybreak let Idaeus go to the ships,"
3935,BOOK VII.,and tell Agamemnon and Menelaus sons of Atreus the saying of
3936,BOOK VII.,Alexandrus through whom this quarrel has come about; and let him
3937,BOOK VII.,also be instant with them that they now cease fighting till we
3938,BOOK VII.,"burn our dead; hereafter we will fight anew, till heaven decide"
3939,BOOK VII.,between us and give victory to one or to the other.”
3940,BOOK VII.,
3941,BOOK VII.,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They took"
3942,BOOK VII.,supper in their companies and at daybreak Idaeus went his way to
3943,BOOK VII.,"the ships. He found the Danaans, servants of Mars, in council at"
3944,BOOK VII.,"the stern of Agamemnon’s ship, and took his place in the midst of"
3945,BOOK VII.,"them. “Son of Atreus,” he said, “and princes of the Achaean host,"
3946,BOOK VII.,Priam and the other noble Trojans have sent me to tell you the
3947,BOOK VII.,"saying of Alexandrus through whom this quarrel has come about, if"
3948,BOOK VII.,so be that you may find it acceptable. All the treasure he took
3949,BOOK VII.,with him in his ships to Troy—would that he had sooner
3950,BOOK VII.,"perished—he will restore, and will add yet further of his own,"
3951,BOOK VII.,"but he will not give up the wedded wife of Menelaus, though the"
3952,BOOK VII.,Trojans would have him do so. Priam bade me inquire further if
3953,BOOK VII.,you will cease fighting till we burn our dead; hereafter we will
3954,BOOK VII.,"fight anew, till heaven decide between us and give victory to one"
3955,BOOK VII.,or to the other.”
3956,BOOK VII.,
3957,BOOK VII.,"They all held their peace, but presently Diomed of the loud"
3958,BOOK VII.,"war-cry spoke, saying, “Let there be no taking, neither treasure,"
3959,BOOK VII.,"nor yet Helen, for even a child may see that the doom of the"
3960,BOOK VII.,Trojans is at hand.”
3961,BOOK VII.,
3962,BOOK VII.,The sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words that
3963,BOOK VII.,"Diomed had spoken, and thereon King Agamemnon said to Idaeus,"
3964,BOOK VII.,"“Idaeus, you have heard the answer the Achaeans make you and I"
3965,BOOK VII.,"with them. But as concerning the dead, I give you leave to burn"
3966,BOOK VII.,"them, for when men are once dead there should be no grudging them"
3967,BOOK VII.,the rites of fire. Let Jove the mighty husband of Juno be witness
3968,BOOK VII.,to this covenant.”
3969,BOOK VII.,
3970,BOOK VII.,"As he spoke he upheld his sceptre in the sight of all the gods,"
3971,BOOK VII.,and Idaeus went back to the strong city of Ilius. The Trojans and
3972,BOOK VII.,Dardanians were gathered in council waiting his return; when he
3973,BOOK VII.,"came, he stood in their midst and delivered his message. As soon"
3974,BOOK VII.,"as they heard it they set about their twofold labour, some to"
3975,BOOK VII.,"gather the corpses, and others to bring in wood. The Argives on"
3976,BOOK VII.,"their part also hastened from their ships, some to gather the"
3977,BOOK VII.,"corpses, and others to bring in wood."
3978,BOOK VII.,
3979,BOOK VII.,"The sun was beginning to beat upon the fields, fresh risen into"
3980,BOOK VII.,"the vault of heaven from the slow still currents of deep Oceanus,"
3981,BOOK VII.,"when the two armies met. They could hardly recognise their dead,"
3982,BOOK VII.,"but they washed the clotted gore from off them, shed tears over"
3983,BOOK VII.,"them, and lifted them upon their waggons. Priam had forbidden the"
3984,BOOK VII.,"Trojans to wail aloud, so they heaped their dead sadly and"
3985,BOOK VII.,"silently upon the pyre, and having burned them went back to the"
3986,BOOK VII.,city of Ilius. The Achaeans in like manner heaped their dead
3987,BOOK VII.,"sadly and silently on the pyre, and having burned them went back"
3988,BOOK VII.,to their ships.
3989,BOOK VII.,
3990,BOOK VII.,"Now in the twilight when it was not yet dawn, chosen bands of the"
3991,BOOK VII.,Achaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow that
3992,BOOK VII.,"was raised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high"
3993,BOOK VII.,wall to shelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong
3994,BOOK VII.,"gates that there might be a way through them for their chariots,"
3995,BOOK VII.,"and close outside it they dug a trench deep and wide, and they"
3996,BOOK VII.,planted it within with stakes.
3997,BOOK VII.,
3998,BOOK VII.,"Thus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods, seated by the side of"
3999,BOOK VII.,"Jove the lord of lightning, marvelled at their great work; but"
4000,BOOK VII.,"Neptune, lord of the earthquake, spoke, saying, “Father Jove,"
4001,BOOK VII.,what mortal in the whole world will again take the gods into his
4002,BOOK VII.,counsel? See you not how the Achaeans have built a wall about
4003,BOOK VII.,"their ships and driven a trench all round it, without offering"
4004,BOOK VII.,hecatombs to the gods? The fame of this wall will reach as far as
4005,BOOK VII.,"dawn itself, and men will no longer think anything of the one"
4006,BOOK VII.,which Phoebus Apollo and myself built with so much labour for
4007,BOOK VII.,Laomedon.”
4008,BOOK VII.,
4009,BOOK VII.,"Jove was displeased and answered, “What, O shaker of the earth,"
4010,BOOK VII.,are you talking about? A god less powerful than yourself might be
4011,BOOK VII.,"alarmed at what they are doing, but your fame reaches as far as"
4012,BOOK VII.,dawn itself. Surely when the Achaeans have gone home with their
4013,BOOK VII.,"ships, you can shatter their wall and fling it into the sea; you"
4014,BOOK VII.,"can cover the beach with sand again, and the great wall of the"
4015,BOOK VII.,Achaeans will then be utterly effaced.”
4016,BOOK VII.,
4017,BOOK VII.,"Thus did they converse, and by sunset the work of the Achaeans"
4018,BOOK VII.,was completed; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and got
4019,BOOK VII.,"their supper. Many ships had come with wine from Lemnos, sent by"
4020,BOOK VII.,"Eueneus the son of Jason, born to him by Hypsipyle. The son of"
4021,BOOK VII.,"Jason freighted them with ten thousand measures of wine, which he"
4022,BOOK VII.,"sent specially to the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus."
4023,BOOK VII.,"From this supply the Achaeans bought their wine, some with"
4024,BOOK VII.,"bronze, some with iron, some with hides, some with whole heifers,"
4025,BOOK VII.,and some again with captives. They spread a goodly banquet and
4026,BOOK VII.,"feasted the whole night through, as also did the Trojans and"
4027,BOOK VII.,their allies in the city. But all the time Jove boded them ill
4028,BOOK VII.,and roared with his portentous thunder. Pale fear got hold upon
4029,BOOK VII.,"them, and they spilled the wine from their cups on to the ground,"
4030,BOOK VII.,nor did any dare drink till he had made offerings to the most
4031,BOOK VII.,mighty son of Saturn. Then they laid themselves down to rest and
4032,BOOK VII.,enjoyed the boon of sleep.
4033,BOOK VII.,
4034,BOOK VII.,
4035,BOOK VII.,
4036,BOOK VII.,
4037,BOOK VIII.,BOOK VIII.
4038,BOOK VIII.,
4039,BOOK VIII.,
4040,BOOK VIII.,Jove forbids the gods to interfere further—There is an even fight
4041,BOOK VIII.,"till midday, but then Jove inclines the scales of victory in"
4042,BOOK VIII.,"favour of the Trojans, who eventually chase the Achaeans within"
4043,BOOK VIII.,their wall—Juno and Minerva set out to help the Trojans: Jove
4044,BOOK VIII.,"sends Iris to turn them back, but later on he promises Juno that"
4045,BOOK VIII.,she shall have her way in the end—Hector’s triumph is stayed by
4046,BOOK VIII.,nightfall—The Trojans bivouac on the plain.
4047,BOOK VIII.,
4048,BOOK VIII.,"Now when Morning, clad in her robe of saffron, had begun to"
4049,BOOK VIII.,"suffuse light over the earth, Jove called the gods in council on"
4050,BOOK VIII.,the topmost crest of serrated Olympus. Then he spoke and all the
4051,BOOK VIII.,"other gods gave ear. “Hear me,” said he, “gods and goddesses,"
4052,BOOK VIII.,that I may speak even as I am minded. Let none of you neither
4053,BOOK VIII.,"goddess nor god try to cross me, but obey me every one of you"
4054,BOOK VIII.,that I may bring this matter to an end. If I see anyone acting
4055,BOOK VIII.,"apart and helping either Trojans or Danaans, he shall be beaten"
4056,BOOK VIII.,inordinately ere he come back again to Olympus; or I will hurl
4057,BOOK VIII.,him down into dark Tartarus far into the deepest pit under the
4058,BOOK VIII.,"earth, where the gates are iron and the floor bronze, as far"
4059,BOOK VIII.,"beneath Hades as heaven is high above the earth, that you may"
4060,BOOK VIII.,learn how much the mightiest I am among you. Try me and find out
4061,BOOK VIII.,"for yourselves. Hangs me a golden chain from heaven, and lay hold"
4062,BOOK VIII.,"of it all of you, gods and goddesses together—tug as you will,"
4063,BOOK VIII.,you will not drag Jove the supreme counsellor from heaven to
4064,BOOK VIII.,earth; but were I to pull at it myself I should draw you up with
4065,BOOK VIII.,"earth and sea into the bargain, then would I bind the chain about"
4066,BOOK VIII.,some pinnacle of Olympus and leave you all dangling in the mid
4067,BOOK VIII.,firmament. So far am I above all others either of gods or men.”
4068,BOOK VIII.,
4069,BOOK VIII.,"They were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he"
4070,BOOK VIII.,"had spoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, “Father,"
4071,BOOK VIII.,"son of Saturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not"
4072,BOOK VIII.,"to be gainsaid, but we are also sorry for the Danaan warriors,"
4073,BOOK VIII.,"who are perishing and coming to a bad end. We will, however,"
4074,BOOK VIII.,"since you so bid us, refrain from actual fighting, but we will"
4075,BOOK VIII.,make serviceable suggestions to the Argives that they may not all
4076,BOOK VIII.,of them perish in your displeasure.”
4077,BOOK VIII.,
4078,BOOK VIII.,"Jove smiled at her and answered, “Take heart, my child,"
4079,BOOK VIII.,"Trito-born; I am not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to"
4080,BOOK VIII.,you.”
4081,BOOK VIII.,
4082,BOOK VIII.,"With this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and"
4083,BOOK VIII.,manes of glittering gold. He girded himself also with gold about
4084,BOOK VIII.,"the body, seized his gold whip and took his seat in his chariot."
4085,BOOK VIII.,Thereon he lashed his horses and they flew forward nothing loth
4086,BOOK VIII.,midway twixt earth and starry heaven. After a while he reached
4087,BOOK VIII.,"many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, and Gargarus, where"
4088,BOOK VIII.,are his grove and fragrant altar. There the father of gods and
4089,BOOK VIII.,"men stayed his horses, took them from the chariot, and hid them"
4090,BOOK VIII.,in a thick cloud; then he took his seat all glorious upon the
4091,BOOK VIII.,"topmost crests, looking down upon the city of Troy and the ships"
4092,BOOK VIII.,of the Achaeans.
4093,BOOK VIII.,
4094,BOOK VIII.,"The Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and"
4095,BOOK VIII.,afterwards put on their armour. The Trojans on the other hand
4096,BOOK VIII.,"likewise armed themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers"
4097,BOOK VIII.,but nevertheless eager perforce to do battle for their wives and
4098,BOOK VIII.,"children. All the gates were flung wide open, and horse and foot"
4099,BOOK VIII.,sallied forth with the tramp as of a great multitude.
4100,BOOK VIII.,
4101,BOOK VIII.,"When they were got together in one place, shield clashed with"
4102,BOOK VIII.,"shield, and spear with spear, in the conflict of mail-clad men."
4103,BOOK VIII.,Mighty was the din as the bossed shields pressed hard on one
4104,BOOK VIII.,"another—death—cry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and"
4105,BOOK VIII.,the earth ran red with blood.
4106,BOOK VIII.,
4107,BOOK VIII.,Now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning their
4108,BOOK VIII.,"weapons beat against one another, and the people fell, but when"
4109,BOOK VIII.,"the sun had reached mid-heaven, the sire of all balanced his"
4110,BOOK VIII.,"golden scales, and put two fates of death within them, one for"
4111,BOOK VIII.,the Trojans and the other for the Achaeans. He took the balance
4112,BOOK VIII.,"by the middle, and when he lifted it up the day of the Achaeans"
4113,BOOK VIII.,sank; the death-fraught scale of the Achaeans settled down upon
4114,BOOK VIII.,"the ground, while that of the Trojans rose heavenwards. Then he"
4115,BOOK VIII.,"thundered aloud from Ida, and sent the glare of his lightning"
4116,BOOK VIII.,"upon the Achaeans; when they saw this, pale fear fell upon them"
4117,BOOK VIII.,and they were sore afraid.
4118,BOOK VIII.,
4119,BOOK VIII.,"Idomeneus dared not stay nor yet Agamemnon, nor did the two"
4120,BOOK VIII.,"Ajaxes, servants of Mars, hold their ground. Nestor knight of"
4121,BOOK VIII.,"Gerene alone stood firm, bulwark of the Achaeans, not of his own"
4122,BOOK VIII.,"will, but one of his horses was disabled. Alexandrus husband of"
4123,BOOK VIII.,lovely Helen had hit it with an arrow just on the top of its head
4124,BOOK VIII.,"where the mane begins to grow away from the skull, a very deadly"
4125,BOOK VIII.,place. The horse bounded in his anguish as the arrow pierced his
4126,BOOK VIII.,"brain, and his struggles threw others into confusion. The old man"
4127,BOOK VIII.,"instantly began cutting the traces with his sword, but Hector’s"
4128,BOOK VIII.,fleet horses bore down upon him through the rout with their bold
4129,BOOK VIII.,"charioteer, even Hector himself, and the old man would have"
4130,BOOK VIII.,"perished there and then had not Diomed been quick to mark, and"
4131,BOOK VIII.,with a loud cry called Ulysses to help him.
4132,BOOK VIII.,
4133,BOOK VIII.,"“Ulysses,” he cried, “noble son of Laertes where are you flying"
4134,BOOK VIII.,"to, with your back turned like a coward? See that you are not"
4135,BOOK VIII.,struck with a spear between the shoulders. Stay here and help me
4136,BOOK VIII.,to defend Nestor from this man’s furious onset.”
4137,BOOK VIII.,
4138,BOOK VIII.,"Ulysses would not give ear, but sped onward to the ships of the"
4139,BOOK VIII.,"Achaeans, and the son of Tydeus flinging himself alone into the"
4140,BOOK VIII.,thick of the fight took his stand before the horses of the son of
4141,BOOK VIII.,"Neleus. “Sir,” said he, “these young warriors are pressing you"
4142,BOOK VIII.,"hard, your force is spent, and age is heavy upon you, your squire"
4143,BOOK VIII.,"is naught, and your horses are slow to move. Mount my chariot and"
4144,BOOK VIII.,see what the horses of Tros can do—how cleverly they can scud
4145,BOOK VIII.,hither and thither over the plain either in flight or in pursuit.
4146,BOOK VIII.,I took them from the hero Aeneas. Let our squires attend to your
4147,BOOK VIII.,"own steeds, but let us drive mine straight at the Trojans, that"
4148,BOOK VIII.,Hector may learn how furiously I too can wield my spear.”
4149,BOOK VIII.,
4150,BOOK VIII.,Nestor knight of Gerene hearkened to his words. Thereon the
4151,BOOK VIII.,"doughty squires, Sthenelus and kind-hearted Eurymedon, saw to"
4152,BOOK VIII.,"Nestor’s horses, while the two both mounted Diomed’s chariot."
4153,BOOK VIII.,Nestor took the reins in his hands and lashed the horses on; they
4154,BOOK VIII.,"were soon close up with Hector, and the son of Tydeus aimed a"
4155,BOOK VIII.,spear at him as he was charging full speed towards them. He
4156,BOOK VIII.,"missed him, but struck his charioteer and squire Eniopeus son of"
4157,BOOK VIII.,noble Thebaeus in the breast by the nipple while the reins were
4158,BOOK VIII.,"in his hands, so that he died there and then, and the horses"
4159,BOOK VIII.,swerved as he fell headlong from the chariot. Hector was greatly
4160,BOOK VIII.,"grieved at the loss of his charioteer, but let him lie for all"
4161,BOOK VIII.,"his sorrow, while he went in quest of another driver; nor did his"
4162,BOOK VIII.,"steeds have to go long without one, for he presently found brave"
4163,BOOK VIII.,"Archeptolemus the son of Iphitus, and made him get up behind the"
4164,BOOK VIII.,"horses, giving the reins into his hand."
4165,BOOK VIII.,
4166,BOOK VIII.,"All had then been lost and no help for it, for they would have"
4167,BOOK VIII.,"been penned up in Ilius like sheep, had not the sire of gods and"
4168,BOOK VIII.,"men been quick to mark, and hurled a fiery flaming thunderbolt"
4169,BOOK VIII.,which fell just in front of Diomed’s horses with a flare of
4170,BOOK VIII.,burning brimstone. The horses were frightened and tried to back
4171,BOOK VIII.,"beneath the car, while the reins dropped from Nestor’s hands."
4172,BOOK VIII.,"Then he was afraid and said to Diomed, “Son of Tydeus, turn your"
4173,BOOK VIII.,horses in flight; see you not that the hand of Jove is against
4174,BOOK VIII.,"you? To-day he vouchsafes victory to Hector; to-morrow, if it so"
4175,BOOK VIII.,"please him, he will again grant it to ourselves; no man, however"
4176,BOOK VIII.,"brave, may thwart the purpose of Jove, for he is far stronger"
4177,BOOK VIII.,than any.”
4178,BOOK VIII.,
4179,BOOK VIII.,"Diomed answered, “All that you have said is true; there is a"
4180,BOOK VIII.,"grief however which pierces me to the very heart, for Hector will"
4181,BOOK VIII.,"talk among the Trojans and say, ‘The son of Tydeus fled before me"
4182,BOOK VIII.,"to the ships.’ This is the vaunt he will make, and may earth then"
4183,BOOK VIII.,swallow me.”
4184,BOOK VIII.,
4185,BOOK VIII.,"“Son of Tydeus,” replied Nestor, “what mean you? Though Hector"
4186,BOOK VIII.,say that you are a coward the Trojans and Dardanians will not
4187,BOOK VIII.,"believe him, nor yet the wives of the mighty warriors whom you"
4188,BOOK VIII.,have laid low.”
4189,BOOK VIII.,
4190,BOOK VIII.,So saying he turned the horses back through the thick of the
4191,BOOK VIII.,"battle, and with a cry that rent the air the Trojans and Hector"
4192,BOOK VIII.,"rained their darts after them. Hector shouted to him and said,"
4193,BOOK VIII.,"“Son of Tydeus, the Danaans have done you honour hitherto as"
4194,BOOK VIII.,"regards your place at table, the meals they give you, and the"
4195,BOOK VIII.,"filling of your cup with wine. Henceforth they will despise you,"
4196,BOOK VIII.,"for you are become no better than a woman. Be off, girl and"
4197,BOOK VIII.,"coward that you are, you shall not scale our walls through any"
4198,BOOK VIII.,flinching upon my part; neither shall you carry off our wives in
4199,BOOK VIII.,"your ships, for I shall kill you with my own hand.”"
4200,BOOK VIII.,
4201,BOOK VIII.,The son of Tydeus was in two minds whether or no to turn his
4202,BOOK VIII.,"horses round again and fight him. Thrice did he doubt, and thrice"
4203,BOOK VIII.,did Jove thunder from the heights of Ida in token to the Trojans
4204,BOOK VIII.,that he would turn the battle in their favour. Hector then
4205,BOOK VIII.,"shouted to them and said, “Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians,"
4206,BOOK VIII.,"lovers of close fighting, be men, my friends, and fight with"
4207,BOOK VIII.,might and with main; I see that Jove is minded to vouchsafe
4208,BOOK VIII.,"victory and great glory to myself, while he will deal destruction"
4209,BOOK VIII.,"upon the Danaans. Fools, for having thought of building this weak"
4210,BOOK VIII.,and worthless wall. It shall not stay my fury; my horses will
4211,BOOK VIII.,"spring lightly over their trench, and when I am at their ships"
4212,BOOK VIII.,"forget not to bring me fire that I may burn them, while I"
4213,BOOK VIII.,slaughter the Argives who will be all dazed and bewildered by the
4214,BOOK VIII.,smoke.”
4215,BOOK VIII.,
4216,BOOK VIII.,"Then he cried to his horses, “Xanthus and Podargus, and you"
4217,BOOK VIII.,"Aethon and goodly Lampus, pay me for your keep now and for all"
4218,BOOK VIII.,the honey-sweet corn with which Andromache daughter of great
4219,BOOK VIII.,"Eetion has fed you, and for she has mixed wine and water for you"
4220,BOOK VIII.,"to drink whenever you would, before doing so even for me who am"
4221,BOOK VIII.,"her own husband. Haste in pursuit, that we may take the shield of"
4222,BOOK VIII.,"Nestor, the fame of which ascends to heaven, for it is of solid"
4223,BOOK VIII.,"gold, arm-rods and all, and that we may strip from the shoulders"
4224,BOOK VIII.,of Diomed the cuirass which Vulcan made him. Could we take these
4225,BOOK VIII.,"two things, the Achaeans would set sail in their ships this"
4226,BOOK VIII.,self-same night.”
4227,BOOK VIII.,
4228,BOOK VIII.,"Thus did he vaunt, but Queen Juno made high Olympus quake as she"
4229,BOOK VIII.,shook with rage upon her throne. Then said she to the mighty god
4230,BOOK VIII.,"of Neptune, “What now, wide ruling lord of the earthquake? Can"
4231,BOOK VIII.,"you find no compassion in your heart for the dying Danaans, who"
4232,BOOK VIII.,bring you many a welcome offering to Helice and to Aegae? Wish
4233,BOOK VIII.,them well then. If all of us who are with the Danaans were to
4234,BOOK VIII.,"drive the Trojans back and keep Jove from helping them, he would"
4235,BOOK VIII.,have to sit there sulking alone on Ida.”
4236,BOOK VIII.,
4237,BOOK VIII.,"King Neptune was greatly troubled and answered, “Juno, rash of"
4238,BOOK VIII.,"tongue, what are you talking about? We other gods must not set"
4239,BOOK VIII.,"ourselves against Jove, for he is far stronger than we are.”"
4240,BOOK VIII.,
4241,BOOK VIII.,Thus did they converse; but the whole space enclosed by the
4242,BOOK VIII.,"ditch, from the ships even to the wall, was filled with horses"
4243,BOOK VIII.,"and warriors, who were pent up there by Hector son of Priam, now"
4244,BOOK VIII.,that the hand of Jove was with him. He would even have set fire
4245,BOOK VIII.,"to the ships and burned them, had not Queen Juno put it into the"
4246,BOOK VIII.,"mind of Agamemnon, to bestir himself and to encourage the"
4247,BOOK VIII.,Achaeans. To this end he went round the ships and tents carrying
4248,BOOK VIII.,"a great purple cloak, and took his stand by the huge black hull"
4249,BOOK VIII.,"of Ulysses’ ship, which was middlemost of all; it was from this"
4250,BOOK VIII.,"place that his voice would carry farthest, on the one hand"
4251,BOOK VIII.,"towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the other"
4252,BOOK VIII.,"towards those of Achilles—for these two heroes, well assured of"
4253,BOOK VIII.,"their own strength, had valorously drawn up their ships at the"
4254,BOOK VIII.,"two ends of the line. From this spot then, with a voice that"
4255,BOOK VIII.,"could be heard afar, he shouted to the Danaans, saying, “Argives,"
4256,BOOK VIII.,"shame on you cowardly creatures, brave in semblance only; where"
4257,BOOK VIII.,are now our vaunts that we should prove victorious—the vaunts we
4258,BOOK VIII.,"made so vaingloriously in Lemnos, when we ate the flesh of horned"
4259,BOOK VIII.,cattle and filled our mixing-bowls to the brim? You vowed that
4260,BOOK VIII.,"you would each of you stand against a hundred or two hundred men,"
4261,BOOK VIII.,"and now you prove no match even for one—for Hector, who will be"
4262,BOOK VIII.,"ere long setting our ships in a blaze. Father Jove, did you ever"
4263,BOOK VIII.,so ruin a great king and rob him so utterly of his greatness?
4264,BOOK VIII.,"Yet, when to my sorrow I was coming hither, I never let my ship"
4265,BOOK VIII.,pass your altars without offering the fat and thigh-bones of
4266,BOOK VIII.,"heifers upon every one of them, so eager was I to sack the city"
4267,BOOK VIII.,of Troy. Vouchsafe me then this prayer—suffer us to escape at any
4268,BOOK VIII.,"rate with our lives, and let not the Achaeans be so utterly"
4269,BOOK VIII.,vanquished by the Trojans.”
4270,BOOK VIII.,
4271,BOOK VIII.,"Thus did he pray, and father Jove pitying his tears vouchsafed"
4272,BOOK VIII.,"him that his people should live, not die; forthwith he sent them"
4273,BOOK VIII.,"an eagle, most unfailingly portentous of all birds, with a young"
4274,BOOK VIII.,fawn in its talons; the eagle dropped the fawn by the altar on
4275,BOOK VIII.,"which the Achaeans sacrificed to Jove the lord of omens; when,"
4276,BOOK VIII.,"therefore, the people saw that the bird had come from Jove, they"
4277,BOOK VIII.,sprang more fiercely upon the Trojans and fought more boldly.
4278,BOOK VIII.,
4279,BOOK VIII.,There was no man of all the many Danaans who could then boast
4280,BOOK VIII.,that he had driven his horses over the trench and gone forth to
4281,BOOK VIII.,fight sooner than the son of Tydeus; long before any one else
4282,BOOK VIII.,"could do so he slew an armed warrior of the Trojans, Agelaus the"
4283,BOOK VIII.,"son of Phradmon. He had turned his horses in flight, but the"
4284,BOOK VIII.,spear struck him in the back midway between his shoulders and
4285,BOOK VIII.,"went right through his chest, and his armour rang rattling round"
4286,BOOK VIII.,him as he fell forward from his chariot.
4287,BOOK VIII.,
4288,BOOK VIII.,"After him came Agamemnon and Menelaus, sons of Atreus, the two"
4289,BOOK VIII.,"Ajaxes clothed in valour as with a garment, Idomeneus and his"
4290,BOOK VIII.,"companion in arms Meriones, peer of murderous Mars, and Eurypylus"
4291,BOOK VIII.,"the brave son of Euaemon. Ninth came Teucer with his bow, and"
4292,BOOK VIII.,took his place under cover of the shield of Ajax son of Telamon.
4293,BOOK VIII.,"When Ajax lifted his shield Teucer would peer round, and when he"
4294,BOOK VIII.,"had hit any one in the throng, the man would fall dead; then"
4295,BOOK VIII.,"Teucer would hie back to Ajax as a child to its mother, and again"
4296,BOOK VIII.,duck down under his shield.
4297,BOOK VIII.,
4298,BOOK VIII.,"Which of the Trojans did brave Teucer first kill? Orsilochus, and"
4299,BOOK VIII.,"then Ormenus and Ophelestes, Daetor, Chromius, and godlike"
4300,BOOK VIII.,"Lycophontes, Amopaon son of Polyaemon, and Melanippus. All these"
4301,BOOK VIII.,"in turn did he lay low upon the earth, and King Agamemnon was"
4302,BOOK VIII.,glad when he saw him making havoc of the Trojans with his mighty
4303,BOOK VIII.,"bow. He went up to him and said, “Teucer, man after my own heart,"
4304,BOOK VIII.,"son of Telamon, captain among the host, shoot on, and be at once"
4305,BOOK VIII.,"the saving of the Danaans and the glory of your father Telamon,"
4306,BOOK VIII.,who brought you up and took care of you in his own house when you
4307,BOOK VIII.,"were a child, bastard though you were. Cover him with glory"
4308,BOOK VIII.,though he is far off; I will promise and I will assuredly
4309,BOOK VIII.,perform; if aegis-bearing Jove and Minerva grant me to sack the
4310,BOOK VIII.,"city of Ilius, you shall have the next best meed of honour after"
4311,BOOK VIII.,"my own—a tripod, or two horses with their chariot, or a woman who"
4312,BOOK VIII.,shall go up into your bed.”
4313,BOOK VIII.,
4314,BOOK VIII.,"And Teucer answered, “Most noble son of Atreus, you need not urge"
4315,BOOK VIII.,"me; from the moment we began to drive them back to Ilius, I have"
4316,BOOK VIII.,never ceased so far as in me lies to look out for men whom I can
4317,BOOK VIII.,"shoot and kill; I have shot eight barbed shafts, and all of them"
4318,BOOK VIII.,"have been buried in the flesh of warlike youths, but this mad dog"
4319,BOOK VIII.,I cannot hit.”
4320,BOOK VIII.,
4321,BOOK VIII.,"As he spoke he aimed another arrow straight at Hector, for he was"
4322,BOOK VIII.,"bent on hitting him; nevertheless he missed him, and the arrow"
4323,BOOK VIII.,"hit Priam’s brave son Gorgythion in the breast. His mother, fair"
4324,BOOK VIII.,"Castianeira, lovely as a goddess, had been married from Aesyme,"
4325,BOOK VIII.,and now he bowed his head as a garden poppy in full bloom when it
4326,BOOK VIII.,is weighed down by showers in spring—even thus heavy bowed his
4327,BOOK VIII.,head beneath the weight of his helmet.
4328,BOOK VIII.,
4329,BOOK VIII.,"Again he aimed at Hector, for he was longing to hit him, and"
4330,BOOK VIII.,"again his arrow missed, for Apollo turned it aside; but he hit"
4331,BOOK VIII.,"Hector’s brave charioteer Archeptolemus in the breast, by the"
4332,BOOK VIII.,"nipple, as he was driving furiously into the fight. The horses"
4333,BOOK VIII.,"swerved aside as he fell headlong from the chariot, and there was"
4334,BOOK VIII.,no life left in him. Hector was greatly grieved at the loss of
4335,BOOK VIII.,"his charioteer, but for all his sorrow he let him lie where he"
4336,BOOK VIII.,"fell, and bade his brother Cebriones, who was hard by, take the"
4337,BOOK VIII.,reins. Cebriones did as he had said. Hector thereon with a loud
4338,BOOK VIII.,"cry sprang from his chariot to the ground, and seizing a great"
4339,BOOK VIII.,stone made straight for Teucer with intent to kill him. Teucer
4340,BOOK VIII.,had just taken an arrow from his quiver and had laid it upon the
4341,BOOK VIII.,"bowstring, but Hector struck him with the jagged stone as he was"
4342,BOOK VIII.,taking aim and drawing the string to his shoulder; he hit him
4343,BOOK VIII.,"just where the collar-bone divides the neck from the chest, a"
4344,BOOK VIII.,"very deadly place, and broke the sinew of his arm so that his"
4345,BOOK VIII.,"wrist was less, and the bow dropped from his hand as he fell"
4346,BOOK VIII.,"forward on his knees. Ajax saw that his brother had fallen, and"
4347,BOOK VIII.,running towards him bestrode him and sheltered him with his
4348,BOOK VIII.,"shield. Meanwhile his two trusty squires, Mecisteus son of"
4349,BOOK VIII.,"Echius, and Alastor, came up and bore him to the ships groaning"
4350,BOOK VIII.,in his great pain.
4351,BOOK VIII.,
4352,BOOK VIII.,"Jove now again put heart into the Trojans, and they drove the"
4353,BOOK VIII.,Achaeans to their deep trench with Hector in all his glory at
4354,BOOK VIII.,their head. As a hound grips a wild boar or lion in flank or
4355,BOOK VIII.,"buttock when he gives him chase, and watches warily for his"
4356,BOOK VIII.,"wheeling, even so did Hector follow close upon the Achaeans, ever"
4357,BOOK VIII.,killing the hindmost as they rushed panic-stricken onwards. When
4358,BOOK VIII.,they had fled through the set stakes and trench and many Achaeans
4359,BOOK VIII.,"had been laid low at the hands of the Trojans, they halted at"
4360,BOOK VIII.,"their ships, calling upon one another and praying every man"
4361,BOOK VIII.,instantly as they lifted up their hands to the gods; but Hector
4362,BOOK VIII.,"wheeled his horses this way and that, his eyes glaring like those"
4363,BOOK VIII.,of Gorgo or murderous Mars.
4364,BOOK VIII.,
4365,BOOK VIII.,"Juno when she saw them had pity upon them, and at once said to"
4366,BOOK VIII.,"Minerva, “Alas, child of aegis-bearing Jove, shall you and I take"
4367,BOOK VIII.,"no more thought for the dying Danaans, though it be the last time"
4368,BOOK VIII.,we ever do so? See how they perish and come to a bad end before
4369,BOOK VIII.,the onset of but a single man. Hector the son of Priam rages with
4370,BOOK VIII.,"intolerable fury, and has already done great mischief.”"
4371,BOOK VIII.,
4372,BOOK VIII.,"Minerva answered, “Would, indeed, this fellow might die in his"
4373,BOOK VIII.,"own land, and fall by the hands of the Achaeans; but my father"
4374,BOOK VIII.,"Jove is mad with spleen, ever foiling me, ever headstrong and"
4375,BOOK VIII.,unjust. He forgets how often I saved his son when he was worn out
4376,BOOK VIII.,by the labours Eurystheus had laid on him. He would weep till his
4377,BOOK VIII.,"cry came up to heaven, and then Jove would send me down to help"
4378,BOOK VIII.,"him; if I had had the sense to foresee all this, when Eurystheus"
4379,BOOK VIII.,"sent him to the house of Hades, to fetch the hell-hound from"
4380,BOOK VIII.,"Erebus, he would never have come back alive out of the deep"
4381,BOOK VIII.,"waters of the river Styx. And now Jove hates me, while he lets"
4382,BOOK VIII.,Thetis have her way because she kissed his knees and took hold of
4383,BOOK VIII.,"his beard, when she was begging him to do honour to Achilles. I"
4384,BOOK VIII.,shall know what to do next time he begins calling me his
4385,BOOK VIII.,"grey-eyed darling. Get our horses ready, while I go within the"
4386,BOOK VIII.,house of aegis-bearing Jove and put on my armour; we shall then
4387,BOOK VIII.,find out whether Priam’s son Hector will be glad to meet us in
4388,BOOK VIII.,"the highways of battle, or whether the Trojans will glut hounds"
4389,BOOK VIII.,and vultures with the fat of their flesh as they be dead by the
4390,BOOK VIII.,ships of the Achaeans.”
4391,BOOK VIII.,
4392,BOOK VIII.,"Thus did she speak and white-armed Juno, daughter of great"
4393,BOOK VIII.,"Saturn, obeyed her words; she set about harnessing her"
4394,BOOK VIII.,"gold-bedizened steeds, while Minerva daughter of aegis-bearing"
4395,BOOK VIII.,"Jove flung her richly vesture, made with her own hands, on to the"
4396,BOOK VIII.,"threshold of her father, and donned the shirt of Jove, arming"
4397,BOOK VIII.,"herself for battle. Then she stepped into her flaming chariot,"
4398,BOOK VIII.,and grasped the spear so stout and sturdy and strong with which
4399,BOOK VIII.,she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her. Juno
4400,BOOK VIII.,"lashed her horses, and the gates of heaven bellowed as they flew"
4401,BOOK VIII.,"open of their own accord—gates over which the Hours preside, in"
4402,BOOK VIII.,"whose hands are heaven and Olympus, either to open the dense"
4403,BOOK VIII.,cloud that hides them or to close it. Through these the goddesses
4404,BOOK VIII.,drove their obedient steeds.
4405,BOOK VIII.,
4406,BOOK VIII.,"But father Jove when he saw them from Ida was very angry, and"
4407,BOOK VIII.,"sent winged Iris with a message to them. “Go,” said he, “fleet"
4408,BOOK VIII.,"Iris, turn them back, and see that they do not come near me, for"
4409,BOOK VIII.,if we come to fighting there will be mischief. This is what I
4410,BOOK VIII.,"say, and this is what I mean to do. I will lame their horses for"
4411,BOOK VIII.,"them; I will hurl them from their chariot, and will break it in"
4412,BOOK VIII.,pieces. It will take them all ten years to heal the wounds my
4413,BOOK VIII.,lightning shall inflict upon them; my grey-eyed daughter will
4414,BOOK VIII.,then learn what quarrelling with her father means. I am less
4415,BOOK VIII.,"surprised and angry with Juno, for whatever I say she always"
4416,BOOK VIII.,contradicts me.”
4417,BOOK VIII.,
4418,BOOK VIII.,"With this Iris went her way, fleet as the wind, from the heights"
4419,BOOK VIII.,of Ida to the lofty summits of Olympus. She met the goddesses at
4420,BOOK VIII.,the outer gates of its many valleys and gave them her message.
4421,BOOK VIII.,"“What,” said she, “are you about? Are you mad? The son of Saturn"
4422,BOOK VIII.,"forbids going. This is what he says, and this is what he means to"
4423,BOOK VIII.,"do, he will lame your horses for you, he will hurl you from your"
4424,BOOK VIII.,"chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take you all ten"
4425,BOOK VIII.,"years to heal the wounds his lightning will inflict upon you,"
4426,BOOK VIII.,"that you may learn, grey-eyed goddess, what quarrelling with your"
4427,BOOK VIII.,"father means. He is less hurt and angry with Juno, for whatever"
4428,BOOK VIII.,"he says she always contradicts him but you, bold hussy, will you"
4429,BOOK VIII.,really dare to raise your huge spear in defiance of Jove?”
4430,BOOK VIII.,
4431,BOOK VIII.,"With this she left them, and Juno said to Minerva, “Of a truth,"
4432,BOOK VIII.,"child of aegis-bearing Jove, I am not for fighting men’s battles"
4433,BOOK VIII.,further in defiance of Jove. Let them live or die as luck will
4434,BOOK VIII.,"have it, and let Jove mete out his judgements upon the Trojans"
4435,BOOK VIII.,and Danaans according to his own pleasure.”
4436,BOOK VIII.,
4437,BOOK VIII.,"She turned her steeds; the Hours presently unyoked them, made"
4438,BOOK VIII.,"them fast to their ambrosial mangers, and leaned the chariot"
4439,BOOK VIII.,against the end wall of the courtyard. The two goddesses then sat
4440,BOOK VIII.,"down upon their golden thrones, amid the company of the other"
4441,BOOK VIII.,gods; but they were very angry.
4442,BOOK VIII.,
4443,BOOK VIII.,"Presently father Jove drove his chariot to Olympus, and entered"
4444,BOOK VIII.,the assembly of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked
4445,BOOK VIII.,"his horses for him, set the car upon its stand, and threw a cloth"
4446,BOOK VIII.,over it. Jove then sat down upon his golden throne and Olympus
4447,BOOK VIII.,"reeled beneath him. Minerva and Juno sat alone, apart from Jove,"
4448,BOOK VIII.,"and neither spoke nor asked him questions, but Jove knew what"
4449,BOOK VIII.,"they meant, and said, “Minerva and Juno, why are you so angry?"
4450,BOOK VIII.,Are you fatigued with killing so many of your dear friends the
4451,BOOK VIII.,"Trojans? Be this as it may, such is the might of my hands that"
4452,BOOK VIII.,all the gods in Olympus cannot turn me; you were both of you
4453,BOOK VIII.,trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and its terrible
4454,BOOK VIII.,doings. I tell you therefore-and it would have surely been—I
4455,BOOK VIII.,"should have struck you with lightning, and your chariots would"
4456,BOOK VIII.,never have brought you back again to Olympus.”
4457,BOOK VIII.,
4458,BOOK VIII.,Minerva and Juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side and
4459,BOOK VIII.,brooded mischief for the Trojans. Minerva sat silent without a
4460,BOOK VIII.,"word, for she was in a furious passion and bitterly incensed"
4461,BOOK VIII.,"against her father; but Juno could not contain herself and said,"
4462,BOOK VIII.,"“What, dread son of Saturn, are you talking about? We know how"
4463,BOOK VIII.,"great your power is, nevertheless we have compassion upon the"
4464,BOOK VIII.,Danaan warriors who are perishing and coming to a bad end. We
4465,BOOK VIII.,"will, however, since you so bid us, refrain from actual fighting,"
4466,BOOK VIII.,"but we will make serviceable suggestions to the Argives, that"
4467,BOOK VIII.,they may not all of them perish in your displeasure.”
4468,BOOK VIII.,
4469,BOOK VIII.,"And Jove answered, “To-morrow morning, Juno, if you choose to do"
4470,BOOK VIII.,"so, you will see the son of Saturn destroying large numbers of"
4471,BOOK VIII.,"the Argives, for fierce Hector shall not cease fighting till he"
4472,BOOK VIII.,has roused the son of Peleus when they are fighting in dire
4473,BOOK VIII.,straits at their ships’ sterns about the body of Patroclus. Like
4474,BOOK VIII.,"it or no, this is how it is decreed; for aught I care, you may go"
4475,BOOK VIII.,"to the lowest depths beneath earth and sea, where Iapetus and"
4476,BOOK VIII.,Saturn dwell in lone Tartarus with neither ray of light nor
4477,BOOK VIII.,breath of wind to cheer them. You may go on and on till you get
4478,BOOK VIII.,"there, and I shall not care one whit for your displeasure; you"
4479,BOOK VIII.,are the greatest vixen living.”
4480,BOOK VIII.,
4481,BOOK VIII.,Juno made him no answer. The sun’s glorious orb now sank into
4482,BOOK VIII.,Oceanus and drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were the
4483,BOOK VIII.,"Trojans when light failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for"
4484,BOOK VIII.,did darkness fall upon the Achaeans.
4485,BOOK VIII.,
4486,BOOK VIII.,"Then Hector led the Trojans back from the ships, and held a"
4487,BOOK VIII.,"council on the open space near the river, where there was a spot"
4488,BOOK VIII.,clear of corpses. They left their chariots and sat down on the
4489,BOOK VIII.,ground to hear the speech he made them. He grasped a spear eleven
4490,BOOK VIII.,"cubits long, the bronze point of which gleamed in front of it,"
4491,BOOK VIII.,while the ring round the spear-head was of gold. Spear in hand he
4492,BOOK VIII.,"spoke. “Hear me,” said he, “Trojans, Dardanians, and allies. I"
4493,BOOK VIII.,deemed but now that I should destroy the ships and all the
4494,BOOK VIII.,"Achaeans with them ere I went back to Ilius, but darkness came on"
4495,BOOK VIII.,too soon. It was this alone that saved them and their ships upon
4496,BOOK VIII.,"the sea-shore. Now, therefore, let us obey the behests of night,"
4497,BOOK VIII.,and prepare our suppers. Take your horses out of their chariots
4498,BOOK VIII.,and give them their feeds of corn; then make speed to bring sheep
4499,BOOK VIII.,and cattle from the city; bring wine also and corn for your
4500,BOOK VIII.,"horses and gather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn"
4501,BOOK VIII.,watchfires whose flare may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may
4502,BOOK VIII.,"try to fly beyond the sea by night, and they must not embark"
4503,BOOK VIII.,scatheless and unmolested; many a man among them must take a dart
4504,BOOK VIII.,"with him to nurse at home, hit with spear or arrow as he is"
4505,BOOK VIII.,"leaping on board his ship, that others may fear to bring war and"
4506,BOOK VIII.,weeping upon the Trojans. Moreover let the heralds tell it about
4507,BOOK VIII.,the city that the growing youths and grey-bearded men are to camp
4508,BOOK VIII.,upon its heaven-built walls. Let the women each of them light a
4509,BOOK VIII.,"great fire in her house, and let watch be safely kept lest the"
4510,BOOK VIII.,"town be entered by surprise while the host is outside. See to it,"
4511,BOOK VIII.,"brave Trojans, as I have said, and let this suffice for the"
4512,BOOK VIII.,moment; at daybreak I will instruct you further. I pray in hope
4513,BOOK VIII.,to Jove and to the gods that we may then drive those fate-sped
4514,BOOK VIII.,"hounds from our land, for ’tis the fates that have borne them and"
4515,BOOK VIII.,"their ships hither. This night, therefore, let us keep watch, but"
4516,BOOK VIII.,with early morning let us put on our armour and rouse fierce war
4517,BOOK VIII.,at the ships of the Achaeans; I shall then know whether brave
4518,BOOK VIII.,Diomed the son of Tydeus will drive me back from the ships to the
4519,BOOK VIII.,"wall, or whether I shall myself slay him and carry off his"
4520,BOOK VIII.,"blood-stained spoils. To-morrow let him show his mettle, abide my"
4521,BOOK VIII.,"spear if he dare. I ween that at break of day, he shall be among"
4522,BOOK VIII.,the first to fall and many another of his comrades round him.
4523,BOOK VIII.,Would that I were as sure of being immortal and never growing
4524,BOOK VIII.,"old, and of being worshipped like Minerva and Apollo, as I am"
4525,BOOK VIII.,that this day will bring evil to the Argives.”
4526,BOOK VIII.,
4527,BOOK VIII.,Thus spoke Hector and the Trojans shouted applause. They took
4528,BOOK VIII.,"their sweating steeds from under the yoke, and made them fast"
4529,BOOK VIII.,each by his own chariot. They made haste to bring sheep and
4530,BOOK VIII.,"cattle from the city, they brought wine also and corn from their"
4531,BOOK VIII.,houses and gathered much wood. They then offered unblemished
4532,BOOK VIII.,"hecatombs to the immortals, and the wind carried the sweet savour"
4533,BOOK VIII.,"of sacrifice to heaven—but the blessed gods partook not thereof,"
4534,BOOK VIII.,for they bitterly hated Ilius with Priam and Priam’s people. Thus
4535,BOOK VIII.,high in hope they sat through the livelong night by the highways
4536,BOOK VIII.,"of war, and many a watchfire did they kindle. As when the stars"
4537,BOOK VIII.,"shine clear, and the moon is bright—there is not a breath of air,"
4538,BOOK VIII.,not a peak nor glade nor jutting headland but it stands out in
4539,BOOK VIII.,the ineffable radiance that breaks from the serene of heaven; the
4540,BOOK VIII.,stars can all of them be told and the heart of the shepherd is
4541,BOOK VIII.,glad—even thus shone the watchfires of the Trojans before Ilius
4542,BOOK VIII.,midway between the ships and the river Xanthus. A thousand
4543,BOOK VIII.,"camp-fires gleamed upon the plain, and in the glow of each there"
4544,BOOK VIII.,"sat fifty men, while the horses, champing oats and corn beside"
4545,BOOK VIII.,"their chariots, waited till dawn should come."
4546,BOOK VIII.,

4553,BOOK IX.,The Embassy to Achilles.
4554,BOOK IX.,
4555,BOOK IX.,"Thus did the Trojans watch. But Panic, comrade of blood-stained"
4556,BOOK IX.,"Rout, had taken fast hold of the Achaeans, and their princes were"
4557,BOOK IX.,all of them in despair. As when the two winds that blow from
4558,BOOK IX.,Thrace—the north and the northwest—spring up of a sudden and
4559,BOOK IX.,rouse the fury of the main—in a moment the dark waves uprear
4560,BOOK IX.,their heads and scatter their sea-wrack in all directions—even
4561,BOOK IX.,thus troubled were the hearts of the Achaeans.
4562,BOOK IX.,
4563,BOOK IX.,The son of Atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to a
4564,BOOK IX.,"council man by man, but not to cry the matter aloud; he made"
4565,BOOK IX.,"haste also himself to call them, and they sat sorry at heart in"
4566,BOOK IX.,their assembly. Agamemnon shed tears as it were a running stream
4567,BOOK IX.,"or cataract on the side of some sheer cliff; and thus, with many"
4568,BOOK IX.,"a heavy sigh he spoke to the Achaeans. “My friends,” said he,"
4569,BOOK IX.,"“princes and councillors of the Argives, the hand of heaven has"
4570,BOOK IX.,been laid heavily upon me. Cruel Jove gave me his solemn promise
4571,BOOK IX.,"that I should sack the city of Troy before returning, but he has"
4572,BOOK IX.,"played me false, and is now bidding me go ingloriously back to"
4573,BOOK IX.,"Argos with the loss of much people. Such is the will of Jove, who"
4574,BOOK IX.,"has laid many a proud city in the dust as he will yet lay others,"
4575,BOOK IX.,"for his power is above all. Now, therefore, let us all do as I"
4576,BOOK IX.,"say and sail back to our own country, for we shall not take"
4577,BOOK IX.,Troy.”
4578,BOOK IX.,
4579,BOOK IX.,"Thus he spoke, and the sons of the Achaeans for a long while sat"
4580,BOOK IX.,"sorrowful there, but they all held their peace, till at last"
4581,BOOK IX.,"Diomed of the loud battle-cry made answer saying, “Son of Atreus,"
4582,BOOK IX.,"I will chide your folly, as is my right in council. Be not then"
4583,BOOK IX.,aggrieved that I should do so. In the first place you attacked me
4584,BOOK IX.,before all the Danaans and said that I was a coward and no
4585,BOOK IX.,soldier. The Argives young and old know that you did so. But the
4586,BOOK IX.,son of scheming Saturn endowed you by halves only. He gave you
4587,BOOK IX.,"honour as the chief ruler over us, but valour, which is the"
4588,BOOK IX.,"highest both right and might he did not give you. Sir, think you"
4589,BOOK IX.,that the sons of the Achaeans are indeed as unwarlike and
4590,BOOK IX.,cowardly as you say they are? If your own mind is set upon going
4591,BOOK IX.,home—go—the way is open to you; the many ships that followed you
4592,BOOK IX.,from Mycene stand ranged upon the sea-shore; but the rest of us
4593,BOOK IX.,stay here till we have sacked Troy. Nay though these too should
4594,BOOK IX.,"turn homeward with their ships, Sthenelus and myself will still"
4595,BOOK IX.,"fight on till we reach the goal of Ilius, for heaven was with us"
4596,BOOK IX.,when we came.”
4597,BOOK IX.,
4598,BOOK IX.,"The sons of the Achaeans shouted applause at the words of Diomed,"
4599,BOOK IX.,"and presently Nestor rose to speak. “Son of Tydeus,” said he, “in"
4600,BOOK IX.,"war your prowess is beyond question, and in council you excel all"
4601,BOOK IX.,who are of your own years; no one of the Achaeans can make light
4602,BOOK IX.,"of what you say nor gainsay it, but you have not yet come to the"
4603,BOOK IX.,end of the whole matter. You are still young—you might be the
4604,BOOK IX.,youngest of my own children—still you have spoken wisely and have
4605,BOOK IX.,counselled the chief of the Achaeans not without discretion;
4606,BOOK IX.,nevertheless I am older than you and I will tell you everything;
4607,BOOK IX.,"therefore let no man, not even King Agamemnon, disregard my"
4608,BOOK IX.,"saying, for he that foments civil discord is a clanless,"
4609,BOOK IX.,hearthless outlaw.
4610,BOOK IX.,
4611,BOOK IX.,"“Now, however, let us obey the behests of night and get our"
4612,BOOK IX.,"suppers, but let the sentinels every man of them camp by the"
4613,BOOK IX.,trench that is without the wall. I am giving these instructions
4614,BOOK IX.,"to the young men; when they have been attended to, do you, son of"
4615,BOOK IX.,"Atreus, give your orders, for you are the most royal among us"
4616,BOOK IX.,all. Prepare a feast for your councillors; it is right and
4617,BOOK IX.,reasonable that you should do so; there is abundance of wine in
4618,BOOK IX.,"your tents, which the ships of the Achaeans bring from Thrace"
4619,BOOK IX.,daily. You have everything at your disposal wherewith to
4620,BOOK IX.,"entertain guests, and you have many subjects. When many are got"
4621,BOOK IX.,"together, you can be guided by him whose counsel is wisest—and"
4622,BOOK IX.,"sorely do we need shrewd and prudent counsel, for the foe has lit"
4623,BOOK IX.,his watchfires hard by our ships. Who can be other than dismayed?
4624,BOOK IX.,"This night will either be the ruin of our host, or save it.”"
4625,BOOK IX.,
4626,BOOK IX.,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The"
4627,BOOK IX.,sentinels went out in their armour under command of Nestor’s son
4628,BOOK IX.,"Thrasymedes, a captain of the host, and of the bold warriors"
4629,BOOK IX.,"Ascalaphus and Ialmenus: there were also Meriones, Aphareus and"
4630,BOOK IX.,"Deipyrus, and the son of Creion, noble Lycomedes. There were"
4631,BOOK IX.,"seven captains of the sentinels, and with each there went a"
4632,BOOK IX.,hundred youths armed with long spears: they took their places
4633,BOOK IX.,"midway between the trench and the wall, and when they had done so"
4634,BOOK IX.,they lit their fires and got every man his supper.
4635,BOOK IX.,
4636,BOOK IX.,The son of Atreus then bade many councillors of the Achaeans to
4637,BOOK IX.,his quarters and prepared a great feast in their honour. They
4638,BOOK IX.,"laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as"
4639,BOOK IX.,"soon as they had enough to eat and drink, old Nestor, whose"
4640,BOOK IX.,"counsel was ever truest, was the first to lay his mind before"
4641,BOOK IX.,"them. He, therefore, with all sincerity and goodwill addressed"
4642,BOOK IX.,them thus.
4643,BOOK IX.,
4644,BOOK IX.,"“With yourself, most noble son of Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon,"
4645,BOOK IX.,"will I both begin my speech and end it, for you are king over"
4646,BOOK IX.,"much people. Jove, moreover, has vouchsafed you to wield the"
4647,BOOK IX.,"sceptre and to uphold righteousness, that you may take thought"
4648,BOOK IX.,for your people under you; therefore it behooves you above all
4649,BOOK IX.,"others both to speak and to give ear, and to out the counsel of"
4650,BOOK IX.,another who shall have been minded to speak wisely. All turns on
4651,BOOK IX.,"you and on your commands, therefore I will say what I think will"
4652,BOOK IX.,be best. No man will be of a truer mind than that which has been
4653,BOOK IX.,"mine from the hour when you, sir, angered Achilles by taking the"
4654,BOOK IX.,girl Briseis from his tent against my judgment. I urged you not
4655,BOOK IX.,"to do so, but you yielded to your own pride, and dishonoured a"
4656,BOOK IX.,hero whom heaven itself had honoured—for you still hold the prize
4657,BOOK IX.,"that had been awarded to him. Now, however, let us think how we"
4658,BOOK IX.,"may appease him, both with presents and fair speeches that may"
4659,BOOK IX.,conciliate him.”
4660,BOOK IX.,
4661,BOOK IX.,"And King Agamemnon answered, “Sir, you have reproved my folly"
4662,BOOK IX.,justly. I was wrong. I own it. One whom heaven befriends is in
4663,BOOK IX.,"himself a host, and Jove has shown that he befriends this man by"
4664,BOOK IX.,destroying much people of the Achaeans. I was blinded with
4665,BOOK IX.,passion and yielded to my worser mind; therefore I will make
4666,BOOK IX.,"amends, and will give him great gifts by way of atonement. I will"
4667,BOOK IX.,tell them in the presence of you all. I will give him seven
4668,BOOK IX.,"tripods that have never yet been on the fire, and ten talents of"
4669,BOOK IX.,gold. I will give him twenty iron cauldrons and twelve strong
4670,BOOK IX.,"horses that have won races and carried off prizes. Rich, indeed,"
4671,BOOK IX.,both in land and gold is he that has as many prizes as my horses
4672,BOOK IX.,"have won me. I will give him seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians,"
4673,BOOK IX.,whom I chose for myself when he took Lesbos—all of surpassing
4674,BOOK IX.,"beauty. I will give him these, and with them her whom I erewhile"
4675,BOOK IX.,"took from him, the daughter of Briseus; and I swear a great oath"
4676,BOOK IX.,"that I never went up into her couch, nor have been with her after"
4677,BOOK IX.,the manner of men and women.
4678,BOOK IX.,
4679,BOOK IX.,"“All these things will I give him now, and if hereafter the gods"
4680,BOOK IX.,"vouchsafe me to sack the city of Priam, let him come when we"
4681,BOOK IX.,"Achaeans are dividing the spoil, and load his ship with gold and"
4682,BOOK IX.,bronze to his liking; furthermore let him take twenty Trojan
4683,BOOK IX.,"women, the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we reach"
4684,BOOK IX.,"Achaean Argos, wealthiest of all lands, he shall be my son-in-law"
4685,BOOK IX.,"and I will show him like honour with my own dear son Orestes, who"
4686,BOOK IX.,"is being nurtured in all abundance. I have three daughters,"
4687,BOOK IX.,"Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa, let him take the one of"
4688,BOOK IX.,"his choice, freely and without gifts of wooing, to the house of"
4689,BOOK IX.,Peleus; I will add such dower to boot as no man ever yet gave his
4690,BOOK IX.,"daughter, and will give him seven well-established cities,"
4691,BOOK IX.,"Cardamyle, Enope, and Hire, where there is grass; holy Pherae and"
4692,BOOK IX.,"the rich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also, and the vine-clad slopes"
4693,BOOK IX.,"of Pedasus, all near the sea, and on the borders of sandy Pylos."
4694,BOOK IX.,The men that dwell there are rich in cattle and sheep; they will
4695,BOOK IX.,"honour him with gifts as though he were a god, and be obedient to"
4696,BOOK IX.,his comfortable ordinances. All this will I do if he will now
4697,BOOK IX.,forgo his anger. Let him then yield; it is only Hades who is
4698,BOOK IX.,utterly ruthless and unyielding—and hence he is of all gods the
4699,BOOK IX.,one most hateful to mankind. Moreover I am older and more royal
4700,BOOK IX.,"than himself. Therefore, let him now obey me.”"
4701,BOOK IX.,
4702,BOOK IX.,"Then Nestor answered, “Most noble son of Atreus, king of men,"
4703,BOOK IX.,"Agamemnon. The gifts you offer are no small ones, let us then"
4704,BOOK IX.,"send chosen messengers, who may go to the tent of Achilles son of"
4705,BOOK IX.,Peleus without delay. Let those go whom I shall name. Let
4706,BOOK IX.,"Phoenix, dear to Jove, lead the way; let Ajax and Ulysses follow,"
4707,BOOK IX.,and let the heralds Odius and Eurybates go with them. Now bring
4708,BOOK IX.,"water for our hands, and bid all keep silence while we pray to"
4709,BOOK IX.,"Jove the son of Saturn, if so be that he may have mercy upon us.”"
4710,BOOK IX.,
4711,BOOK IX.,"Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well. Men-servants"
4712,BOOK IX.,"poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled the"
4713,BOOK IX.,"mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after"
4714,BOOK IX.,"giving every man his drink-offering; then, when they had made"
4715,BOOK IX.,"their offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the"
4716,BOOK IX.,envoys set out from the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus; and
4717,BOOK IX.,"Nestor, looking first to one and then to another, but most"
4718,BOOK IX.,"especially at Ulysses, was instant with them that they should"
4719,BOOK IX.,prevail with the noble son of Peleus.
4720,BOOK IX.,
4721,BOOK IX.,"They went their way by the shore of the sounding sea, and prayed"
4722,BOOK IX.,earnestly to earth-encircling Neptune that the high spirit of the
4723,BOOK IX.,son of Aeacus might incline favourably towards them. When they
4724,BOOK IX.,"reached the ships and tents of the Myrmidons, they found Achilles"
4725,BOOK IX.,"playing on a lyre, fair, of cunning workmanship, and its"
4726,BOOK IX.,cross-bar was of silver. It was part of the spoils which he had
4727,BOOK IX.,"taken when he sacked the city of Eetion, and he was now diverting"
4728,BOOK IX.,himself with it and singing the feats of heroes. He was alone
4729,BOOK IX.,"with Patroclus, who sat opposite to him and said nothing, waiting"
4730,BOOK IX.,till he should cease singing. Ulysses and Ajax now came
4731,BOOK IX.,in—Ulysses leading the way—and stood before him. Achilles sprang
4732,BOOK IX.,"from his seat with the lyre still in his hand, and Patroclus,"
4733,BOOK IX.,"when he saw the strangers, rose also. Achilles then greeted them"
4734,BOOK IX.,"saying, “All hail and welcome—you must come upon some great"
4735,BOOK IX.,"matter, you, who for all my anger are still dearest to me of the"
4736,BOOK IX.,Achaeans.”
4737,BOOK IX.,
4738,BOOK IX.,"With this he led them forward, and bade them sit on seats covered"
4739,BOOK IX.,"with purple rugs; then he said to Patroclus who was close by him,"
4740,BOOK IX.,"“Son of Menoetius, set a larger bowl upon the table, mix less"
4741,BOOK IX.,"water with the wine, and give every man his cup, for these are"
4742,BOOK IX.,"very dear friends, who are now under my roof.”"
4743,BOOK IX.,
4744,BOOK IX.,Patroclus did as his comrade bade him; he set the chopping-block
4745,BOOK IX.,"in front of the fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep, the"
4746,BOOK IX.,"loin also of a goat, and the chine of a fat hog. Automedon held"
4747,BOOK IX.,the meat while Achilles chopped it; he then sliced the pieces and
4748,BOOK IX.,put them on spits while the son of Menoetius made the fire burn
4749,BOOK IX.,"high. When the flame had died down, he spread the embers, laid"
4750,BOOK IX.,"the spits on top of them, lifting them up and setting them upon"
4751,BOOK IX.,the spit-racks; and he sprinkled them with salt. When the meat
4752,BOOK IX.,"was roasted, he set it on platters, and handed bread round the"
4753,BOOK IX.,"table in fair baskets, while Achilles dealt them their portions."
4754,BOOK IX.,Then Achilles took his seat facing Ulysses against the opposite
4755,BOOK IX.,"wall, and bade his comrade Patroclus offer sacrifice to the gods;"
4756,BOOK IX.,"so he cast the offerings into the fire, and they laid their hands"
4757,BOOK IX.,upon the good things that were before them. As soon as they had
4758,BOOK IX.,"had enough to eat and drink, Ajax made a sign to Phoenix, and"
4759,BOOK IX.,"when he saw this, Ulysses filled his cup with wine and pledged"
4760,BOOK IX.,Achilles.
4761,BOOK IX.,
4762,BOOK IX.,"“Hail,” said he, “Achilles, we have had no scant of good cheer,"
4763,BOOK IX.,"neither in the tent of Agamemnon, nor yet here; there has been"
4764,BOOK IX.,"plenty to eat and drink, but our thought turns upon no such"
4765,BOOK IX.,"matter. Sir, we are in the face of great disaster, and without"
4766,BOOK IX.,your help know not whether we shall save our fleet or lose it.
4767,BOOK IX.,The Trojans and their allies have camped hard by our ships and by
4768,BOOK IX.,the wall; they have lit watchfires throughout their host and deem
4769,BOOK IX.,that nothing can now prevent them from falling on our fleet.
4770,BOOK IX.,"Jove, moreover, has sent his lightnings on their right; Hector,"
4771,BOOK IX.,"in all his glory, rages like a maniac; confident that Jove is"
4772,BOOK IX.,"with him he fears neither god nor man, but is gone raving mad,"
4773,BOOK IX.,and prays for the approach of day. He vows that he will hew the
4774,BOOK IX.,"high sterns of our ships in pieces, set fire to their hulls, and"
4775,BOOK IX.,make havoc of the Achaeans while they are dazed and smothered in
4776,BOOK IX.,"smoke; I much fear that heaven will make good his boasting, and"
4777,BOOK IX.,it will prove our lot to perish at Troy far from our home in
4778,BOOK IX.,"Argos. Up, then, and late though it be, save the sons of the"
4779,BOOK IX.,Achaeans who faint before the fury of the Trojans. You will
4780,BOOK IX.,"repent bitterly hereafter if you do not, for when the harm is"
4781,BOOK IX.,"done there will be no curing it; consider ere it be too late, and"
4782,BOOK IX.,save the Danaans from destruction.
4783,BOOK IX.,
4784,BOOK IX.,"“My good friend, when your father Peleus sent you from Phthia to"
4785,BOOK IX.,"Agamemnon, did he not charge you saying, ‘Son, Minerva and Juno"
4786,BOOK IX.,"will make you strong if they choose, but check your high temper,"
4787,BOOK IX.,"for the better part is in goodwill. Eschew vain quarrelling, and"
4788,BOOK IX.,the Achaeans old and young will respect you more for doing so.’
4789,BOOK IX.,"These were his words, but you have forgotten them. Even now,"
4790,BOOK IX.,"however, be appeased, and put away your anger from you. Agamemnon"
4791,BOOK IX.,"will make you great amends if you will forgive him; listen, and I"
4792,BOOK IX.,will tell you what he has said in his tent that he will give you.
4793,BOOK IX.,He will give you seven tripods that have never yet been on the
4794,BOOK IX.,"fire, and ten talents of gold; twenty iron cauldrons, and twelve"
4795,BOOK IX.,strong horses that have won races and carried off prizes. Rich
4796,BOOK IX.,indeed both in land and gold is he who has as many prizes as
4797,BOOK IX.,these horses have won for Agamemnon. Moreover he will give you
4798,BOOK IX.,"seven excellent workwomen, Lesbians, whom he chose for himself,"
4799,BOOK IX.,when you took Lesbos—all of surpassing beauty. He will give you
4800,BOOK IX.,"these, and with them her whom he erewhile took from you, the"
4801,BOOK IX.,"daughter of Briseus, and he will swear a great oath, he has never"
4802,BOOK IX.,gone up into her couch nor been with her after the manner of men
4803,BOOK IX.,"and women. All these things will he give you now down, and if"
4804,BOOK IX.,"hereafter the gods vouchsafe him to sack the city of Priam, you"
4805,BOOK IX.,"can come when we Achaeans are dividing the spoil, and load your"
4806,BOOK IX.,ship with gold and bronze to your liking. You can take twenty
4807,BOOK IX.,"Trojan women, the loveliest after Helen herself. Then, when we"
4808,BOOK IX.,"reach Achaean Argos, wealthiest of all lands, you shall be his"
4809,BOOK IX.,"son-in-law, and he will show you like honour with his own dear"
4810,BOOK IX.,"son Orestes, who is being nurtured in all abundance. Agamemnon"
4811,BOOK IX.,"has three daughters, Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa; you"
4812,BOOK IX.,"may take the one of your choice, freely and without gifts of"
4813,BOOK IX.,"wooing, to the house of Peleus; he will add such dower to boot as"
4814,BOOK IX.,"no man ever yet gave his daughter, and will give you seven"
4815,BOOK IX.,"well-established cities, Cardamyle, Enope, and Hire where there"
4816,BOOK IX.,"is grass; holy Pherae and the rich meadows of Anthea; Aepea also,"
4817,BOOK IX.,"and the vine-clad slopes of Pedasus, all near the sea, and on the"
4818,BOOK IX.,borders of sandy Pylos. The men that dwell there are rich in
4819,BOOK IX.,cattle and sheep; they will honour you with gifts as though were
4820,BOOK IX.,"a god, and be obedient to your comfortable ordinances. All this"
4821,BOOK IX.,"will he do if you will now forgo your anger. Moreover, though you"
4822,BOOK IX.,"hate both him and his gifts with all your heart, yet pity the"
4823,BOOK IX.,rest of the Achaeans who are being harassed in all their host;
4824,BOOK IX.,"they will honour you as a god, and you will earn great glory at"
4825,BOOK IX.,their hands. You might even kill Hector; he will come within your
4826,BOOK IX.,"reach, for he is infatuated, and declares that not a Danaan whom"
4827,BOOK IX.,the ships have brought can hold his own against him.”
4828,BOOK IX.,
4829,BOOK IX.,"Achilles answered, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, I should give"
4830,BOOK IX.,you formal notice plainly and in all fixity of purpose that there
4831,BOOK IX.,"be no more of this cajoling, from whatsoever quarter it may come."
4832,BOOK IX.,Him do I hate even as the gates of hell who says one thing while
4833,BOOK IX.,he hides another in his heart; therefore I will say what I mean.
4834,BOOK IX.,I will be appeased neither by Agamemnon son of Atreus nor by any
4835,BOOK IX.,"other of the Danaans, for I see that I have no thanks for all my"
4836,BOOK IX.,fighting. He that fights fares no better than he that does not;
4837,BOOK IX.,"coward and hero are held in equal honour, and death deals like"
4838,BOOK IX.,measure to him who works and him who is idle. I have taken
4839,BOOK IX.,nothing by all my hardships—with my life ever in my hand; as a
4840,BOOK IX.,"bird when she has found a morsel takes it to her nestlings, and"
4841,BOOK IX.,"herself fares hardly, even so many a long night have I been"
4842,BOOK IX.,"wakeful, and many a bloody battle have I waged by day against"
4843,BOOK IX.,those who were fighting for their women. With my ships I have
4844,BOOK IX.,"taken twelve cities, and eleven round about Troy have I stormed"
4845,BOOK IX.,with my men by land; I took great store of wealth from every one
4846,BOOK IX.,"of them, but I gave all up to Agamemnon son of Atreus. He stayed"
4847,BOOK IX.,"where he was by his ships, yet of what came to him he gave"
4848,BOOK IX.,"little, and kept much himself."
4849,BOOK IX.,
4850,BOOK IX.,“Nevertheless he did distribute some meeds of honour among the
4851,BOOK IX.,"chieftains and kings, and these have them still; from me alone of"
4852,BOOK IX.,the Achaeans did he take the woman in whom I delighted—let him
4853,BOOK IX.,"keep her and sleep with her. Why, pray, must the Argives needs"
4854,BOOK IX.,fight the Trojans? What made the son of Atreus gather the host
4855,BOOK IX.,and bring them? Was it not for the sake of Helen? Are the sons of
4856,BOOK IX.,Atreus the only men in the world who love their wives? Any man of
4857,BOOK IX.,"common right feeling will love and cherish her who is his own, as"
4858,BOOK IX.,"I this woman, with my whole heart, though she was but a fruitling"
4859,BOOK IX.,of my spear. Agamemnon has taken her from me; he has played me
4860,BOOK IX.,"false; I know him; let him tempt me no further, for he shall not"
4861,BOOK IX.,"move me. Let him look to you, Ulysses, and to the other princes"
4862,BOOK IX.,to save his ships from burning. He has done much without me
4863,BOOK IX.,already. He has built a wall; he has dug a trench deep and wide
4864,BOOK IX.,"all round it, and he has planted it within with stakes; but even"
4865,BOOK IX.,so he stays not the murderous might of Hector. So long as I
4866,BOOK IX.,fought the Achaeans Hector suffered not the battle range far from
4867,BOOK IX.,the city walls; he would come to the Scaean gates and to the oak
4868,BOOK IX.,"tree, but no further. Once he stayed to meet me and hardly did he"
4869,BOOK IX.,"escape my onset: now, however, since I am in no mood to fight"
4870,BOOK IX.,"him, I will to-morrow offer sacrifice to Jove and to all the"
4871,BOOK IX.,gods; I will draw my ships into the water and then victual them
4872,BOOK IX.,"duly; to-morrow morning, if you care to look, you will see my"
4873,BOOK IX.,"ships on the Hellespont, and my men rowing out to sea with might"
4874,BOOK IX.,"and main. If great Neptune vouchsafes me a fair passage, in three"
4875,BOOK IX.,days I shall be in Phthia. I have much there that I left behind
4876,BOOK IX.,"me when I came here to my sorrow, and I shall bring back still"
4877,BOOK IX.,"further store of gold, of red copper, of fair women, and of iron,"
4878,BOOK IX.,"my share of the spoils that we have taken; but one prize, he who"
4879,BOOK IX.,"gave has insolently taken away. Tell him all as I now bid you,"
4880,BOOK IX.,and tell him in public that the Achaeans may hate him and beware
4881,BOOK IX.,of him should he think that he can yet dupe others for his
4882,BOOK IX.,effrontery never fails him.
4883,BOOK IX.,
4884,BOOK IX.,"“As for me, hound that he is, he dares not look me in the face. I"
4885,BOOK IX.,"will take no counsel with him, and will undertake nothing in"
4886,BOOK IX.,"common with him. He has wronged me and deceived me enough, he"
4887,BOOK IX.,"shall not cozen me further; let him go his own way, for Jove has"
4888,BOOK IX.,"robbed him of his reason. I loathe his presents, and for himself"
4889,BOOK IX.,care not one straw. He may offer me ten or even twenty times what
4890,BOOK IX.,"he has now done, nay—not though it be all that he has in the"
4891,BOOK IX.,"world, both now or ever shall have; he may promise me the wealth"
4892,BOOK IX.,"of Orchomenus or of Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in"
4893,BOOK IX.,"the whole world, for it has a hundred gates through each of which"
4894,BOOK IX.,two hundred men may drive at once with their chariots and horses;
4895,BOOK IX.,he may offer me gifts as the sands of the sea or the dust of the
4896,BOOK IX.,"plain in multitude, but even so he shall not move me till I have"
4897,BOOK IX.,been revenged in full for the bitter wrong he has done me. I will
4898,BOOK IX.,"not marry his daughter; she may be fair as Venus, and skilful as"
4899,BOOK IX.,"Minerva, but I will have none of her: let another take her, who"
4900,BOOK IX.,may be a good match for her and who rules a larger kingdom. If
4901,BOOK IX.,"the gods spare me to return home, Peleus will find me a wife;"
4902,BOOK IX.,"there are Achaean women in Hellas and Phthia, daughters of kings"
4903,BOOK IX.,that have cities under them; of these I can take whom I will and
4904,BOOK IX.,marry her. Many a time was I minded when at home in Phthia to woo
4905,BOOK IX.,"and wed a woman who would make me a suitable wife, and to enjoy"
4906,BOOK IX.,the riches of my old father Peleus. My life is more to me than
4907,BOOK IX.,all the wealth of Ilius while it was yet at peace before the
4908,BOOK IX.,"Achaeans went there, or than all the treasure that lies on the"
4909,BOOK IX.,stone floor of Apollo’s temple beneath the cliffs of Pytho.
4910,BOOK IX.,"Cattle and sheep are to be had for harrying, and a man buy both"
4911,BOOK IX.,"tripods and horses if he wants them, but when his life has once"
4912,BOOK IX.,left him it can neither be bought nor harried back again.
4913,BOOK IX.,
4914,BOOK IX.,“My mother Thetis tells me that there are two ways in which I may
4915,BOOK IX.,"meet my end. If I stay here and fight, I shall not return alive"
4916,BOOK IX.,but my name will live for ever: whereas if I go home my name will
4917,BOOK IX.,"die, but it will be long ere death shall take me. To the rest of"
4918,BOOK IX.,"you, then, I say, ‘Go home, for you will not take Ilius.’ Jove"
4919,BOOK IX.,"has held his hand over her to protect her, and her people have"
4920,BOOK IX.,"taken heart. Go, therefore, as in duty bound, and tell the"
4921,BOOK IX.,princes of the Achaeans the message that I have sent them; tell
4922,BOOK IX.,them to find some other plan for the saving of their ships and
4923,BOOK IX.,"people, for so long as my displeasure lasts the one that they"
4924,BOOK IX.,"have now hit upon may not be. As for Phoenix, let him sleep here"
4925,BOOK IX.,that he may sail with me in the morning if he so will. But I will
4926,BOOK IX.,not take him by force.”
4927,BOOK IX.,
4928,BOOK IX.,"They all held their peace, dismayed at the sternness with which"
4929,BOOK IX.,"he had denied them, till presently the old knight Phoenix in his"
4930,BOOK IX.,"great fear for the ships of the Achaeans, burst into tears and"
4931,BOOK IX.,"said, “Noble Achilles, if you are now minded to return, and in"
4932,BOOK IX.,the fierceness of your anger will do nothing to save the ships
4933,BOOK IX.,"from burning, how, my son, can I remain here without you? Your"
4934,BOOK IX.,father Peleus bade me go with you when he sent you as a mere lad
4935,BOOK IX.,from Phthia to Agamemnon. You knew nothing neither of war nor of
4936,BOOK IX.,"the arts whereby men make their mark in council, and he sent me"
4937,BOOK IX.,with you to train you in all excellence of speech and action.
4938,BOOK IX.,"Therefore, my son, I will not stay here without you—no, not"
4939,BOOK IX.,"though heaven itself vouchsafe to strip my years from off me, and"
4940,BOOK IX.,make me young as I was when I first left Hellas the land of fair
4941,BOOK IX.,"women. I was then flying the anger of father Amyntor, son of"
4942,BOOK IX.,"Ormenus, who was furious with me in the matter of his concubine,"
4943,BOOK IX.,of whom he was enamoured to the wronging of his wife my mother.
4944,BOOK IX.,"My mother, therefore, prayed me without ceasing to lie with the"
4945,BOOK IX.,"woman myself, that so she hate my father, and in the course of"
4946,BOOK IX.,"time I yielded. But my father soon came to know, and cursed me"
4947,BOOK IX.,"bitterly, calling the dread Erinyes to witness. He prayed that no"
4948,BOOK IX.,"son of mine might ever sit upon knees—and the gods, Jove of the"
4949,BOOK IX.,"world below and awful Proserpine, fulfilled his curse. I took"
4950,BOOK IX.,"counsel to kill him, but some god stayed my rashness and bade me"
4951,BOOK IX.,think on men’s evil tongues and how I should be branded as the
4952,BOOK IX.,murderer of my father; nevertheless I could not bear to stay in
4953,BOOK IX.,my father’s house with him so bitter against me. My cousins and
4954,BOOK IX.,"clansmen came about me, and pressed me sorely to remain; many a"
4955,BOOK IX.,"sheep and many an ox did they slaughter, and many a fat hog did"
4956,BOOK IX.,"they set down to roast before the fire; many a jar, too, did they"
4957,BOOK IX.,broach of my father’s wine. Nine whole nights did they set a
4958,BOOK IX.,"guard over me taking it in turns to watch, and they kept a fire"
4959,BOOK IX.,"always burning, both in the cloister of the outer court and in"
4960,BOOK IX.,the inner court at the doors of the room wherein I lay; but when
4961,BOOK IX.,"the darkness of the tenth night came, I broke through the closed"
4962,BOOK IX.,"doors of my room, and climbed the wall of the outer court after"
4963,BOOK IX.,passing quickly and unperceived through the men on guard and the
4964,BOOK IX.,women servants. I then fled through Hellas till I came to fertile
4965,BOOK IX.,"Phthia, mother of sheep, and to King Peleus, who made me welcome"
4966,BOOK IX.,and treated me as a father treats an only son who will be heir to
4967,BOOK IX.,"all his wealth. He made me rich and set me over much people,"
4968,BOOK IX.,establishing me on the borders of Phthia where I was chief ruler
4969,BOOK IX.,over the Dolopians.
4970,BOOK IX.,
4971,BOOK IX.,"“It was I, Achilles, who had the making of you; I loved you with"
4972,BOOK IX.,all my heart: for you would eat neither at home nor when you had
4973,BOOK IX.,"gone out elsewhere, till I had first set you upon my knees, cut"
4974,BOOK IX.,"up the dainty morsel that you were to eat, and held the wine-cup"
4975,BOOK IX.,to your lips. Many a time have you slobbered your wine in baby
4976,BOOK IX.,"helplessness over my shirt; I had infinite trouble with you, but"
4977,BOOK IX.,"I knew that heaven had vouchsafed me no offspring of my own, and"
4978,BOOK IX.,"I made a son of you, Achilles, that in my hour of need you might"
4979,BOOK IX.,"protect me. Now, therefore, I say battle with your pride and beat"
4980,BOOK IX.,it; cherish not your anger for ever; the might and majesty of
4981,BOOK IX.,"heaven are more than ours, but even heaven may be appeased; and"
4982,BOOK IX.,"if a man has sinned he prays the gods, and reconciles them to"
4983,BOOK IX.,"himself by his piteous cries and by frankincense, with"
4984,BOOK IX.,drink-offerings and the savour of burnt sacrifice. For prayers
4985,BOOK IX.,"are as daughters to great Jove; halt, wrinkled, with eyes"
4986,BOOK IX.,"askance, they follow in the footsteps of sin, who, being fierce"
4987,BOOK IX.,"and fleet of foot, leaves them far behind him, and ever baneful"
4988,BOOK IX.,to mankind outstrips them even to the ends of the world; but
4989,BOOK IX.,nevertheless the prayers come hobbling and healing after. If a
4990,BOOK IX.,man has pity upon these daughters of Jove when they draw near
4991,BOOK IX.,"him, they will bless him and hear him too when he is praying; but"
4992,BOOK IX.,"if he deny them and will not listen to them, they go to Jove the"
4993,BOOK IX.,son of Saturn and pray that he may presently fall into sin—to his
4994,BOOK IX.,"ruing bitterly hereafter. Therefore, Achilles, give these"
4995,BOOK IX.,"daughters of Jove due reverence, and bow before them as all good"
4996,BOOK IX.,men will bow. Were not the son of Atreus offering you gifts and
4997,BOOK IX.,promising others later—if he were still furious and implacable—I
4998,BOOK IX.,am not he that would bid you throw off your anger and help the
4999,BOOK IX.,"Achaeans, no matter how great their need; but he is giving much"
5000,BOOK IX.,"now, and more hereafter; he has sent his captains to urge his"
5001,BOOK IX.,"suit, and has chosen those who of all the Argives are most"
5002,BOOK IX.,acceptable to you; make not then their words and their coming to
5003,BOOK IX.,be of none effect. Your anger has been righteous so far. We have
5004,BOOK IX.,heard in song how heroes of old time quarrelled when they were
5005,BOOK IX.,"roused to fury, but still they could be won by gifts, and fair"
5006,BOOK IX.,words could soothe them.
5007,BOOK IX.,
5008,BOOK IX.,“I have an old story in my mind—a very old one—but you are all
5009,BOOK IX.,friends and I will tell it. The Curetes and the Aetolians were
5010,BOOK IX.,fighting and killing one another round Calydon—the Aetolians
5011,BOOK IX.,defending the city and the Curetes trying to destroy it. For
5012,BOOK IX.,Diana of the golden throne was angry and did them hurt because
5013,BOOK IX.,Oeneus had not offered her his harvest first-fruits. The other
5014,BOOK IX.,"gods had all been feasted with hecatombs, but to the daughter of"
5015,BOOK IX.,"great Jove alone he had made no sacrifice. He had forgotten her,"
5016,BOOK IX.,"or somehow or other it had escaped him, and this was a grievous"
5017,BOOK IX.,sin. Thereon the archer goddess in her displeasure sent a
5018,BOOK IX.,prodigious creature against him—a savage wild boar with great
5019,BOOK IX.,"white tusks that did much harm to his orchard lands, uprooting"
5020,BOOK IX.,apple-trees in full bloom and throwing them to the ground. But
5021,BOOK IX.,Meleager son of Oeneus got huntsmen and hounds from many cities
5022,BOOK IX.,"and killed it—for it was so monstrous that not a few were needed,"
5023,BOOK IX.,and many a man did it stretch upon his funeral pyre. On this the
5024,BOOK IX.,goddess set the Curetes and the Aetolians fighting furiously
5025,BOOK IX.,about the head and skin of the boar.
5026,BOOK IX.,
5027,BOOK IX.,“So long as Meleager was in the field things went badly with the
5028,BOOK IX.,"Curetes, and for all their numbers they could not hold their"
5029,BOOK IX.,ground under the city walls; but in the course of time Meleager
5030,BOOK IX.,was angered as even a wise man will sometimes be. He was incensed
5031,BOOK IX.,"with his mother Althaea, and therefore stayed at home with his"
5032,BOOK IX.,"wedded wife fair Cleopatra, who was daughter of Marpessa daughter"
5033,BOOK IX.,"of Euenus, and of Ides the man then living. He it was who took"
5034,BOOK IX.,his bow and faced King Apollo himself for fair Marpessa’s sake;
5035,BOOK IX.,"her father and mother then named her Alcyone, because her mother"
5036,BOOK IX.,had mourned with the plaintive strains of the halcyon-bird when
5037,BOOK IX.,"Phoebus Apollo had carried her off. Meleager, then, stayed at"
5038,BOOK IX.,"home with Cleopatra, nursing the anger which he felt by reason of"
5039,BOOK IX.,"his mother’s curses. His mother, grieving for the death of her"
5040,BOOK IX.,"brother, prayed the gods, and beat the earth with her hands,"
5041,BOOK IX.,calling upon Hades and on awful Proserpine; she went down upon
5042,BOOK IX.,her knees and her bosom was wet with tears as she prayed that
5043,BOOK IX.,they would kill her son—and Erinys that walks in darkness and
5044,BOOK IX.,knows no ruth heard her from Erebus.
5045,BOOK IX.,
5046,BOOK IX.,"“Then was heard the din of battle about the gates of Calydon, and"
5047,BOOK IX.,the dull thump of the battering against their walls. Thereon the
5048,BOOK IX.,elders of the Aetolians besought Meleager; they sent the chiefest
5049,BOOK IX.,"of their priests, and begged him to come out and help them,"
5050,BOOK IX.,promising him a great reward. They bade him choose fifty
5051,BOOK IX.,"plough-gates, the most fertile in the plain of Calydon, the"
5052,BOOK IX.,one-half vineyard and the other open plough-land. The old warrior
5053,BOOK IX.,"Oeneus implored him, standing at the threshold of his room and"
5054,BOOK IX.,beating the doors in supplication. His sisters and his mother
5055,BOOK IX.,"herself besought him sore, but he the more refused them; those of"
5056,BOOK IX.,"his comrades who were nearest and dearest to him also prayed him,"
5057,BOOK IX.,but they could not move him till the foe was battering at the
5058,BOOK IX.,"very doors of his chamber, and the Curetes had scaled the walls"
5059,BOOK IX.,and were setting fire to the city. Then at last his sorrowing
5060,BOOK IX.,wife detailed the horrors that befall those whose city is taken;
5061,BOOK IX.,"she reminded him how the men are slain, and the city is given"
5062,BOOK IX.,"over to the flames, while the women and children are carried into"
5063,BOOK IX.,"captivity; when he heard all this, his heart was touched, and he"
5064,BOOK IX.,donned his armour to go forth. Thus of his own inward motion he
5065,BOOK IX.,saved the city of the Aetolians; but they now gave him nothing of
5066,BOOK IX.,"those rich rewards that they had offered earlier, and though he"
5067,BOOK IX.,"saved the city he took nothing by it. Be not then, my son, thus"
5068,BOOK IX.,minded; let not heaven lure you into any such course. When the
5069,BOOK IX.,ships are burning it will be a harder matter to save them. Take
5070,BOOK IX.,"the gifts, and go, for the Achaeans will then honour you as a"
5071,BOOK IX.,"god; whereas if you fight without taking them, you may beat the"
5072,BOOK IX.,"battle back, but you will not be held in like honour.”"
5073,BOOK IX.,
5074,BOOK IX.,"And Achilles answered, “Phoenix, old friend and father, I have no"
5075,BOOK IX.,"need of such honour. I have honour from Jove himself, which will"
5076,BOOK IX.,"abide with me at my ships while I have breath in my body, and my"
5077,BOOK IX.,limbs are strong. I say further—and lay my saying to your
5078,BOOK IX.,"heart—vex me no more with this weeping and lamentation, all in"
5079,BOOK IX.,"the cause of the son of Atreus. Love him so well, and you may"
5080,BOOK IX.,lose the love I bear you. You ought to help me rather in
5081,BOOK IX.,"troubling those that trouble me; be king as much as I am, and"
5082,BOOK IX.,share like honour with myself; the others shall take my answer;
5083,BOOK IX.,stay here yourself and sleep comfortably in your bed; at daybreak
5084,BOOK IX.,we will consider whether to remain or go.”
5085,BOOK IX.,
5086,BOOK IX.,On this he nodded quietly to Patroclus as a sign that he was to
5087,BOOK IX.,"prepare a bed for Phoenix, and that the others should take their"
5088,BOOK IX.,"leave. Ajax son of Telamon then said, “Ulysses, noble son of"
5089,BOOK IX.,"Laertes, let us be gone, for I see that our journey is vain. We"
5090,BOOK IX.,"must now take our answer, unwelcome though it be, to the Danaans"
5091,BOOK IX.,who are waiting to receive it. Achilles is savage and
5092,BOOK IX.,"remorseless; he is cruel, and cares nothing for the love his"
5093,BOOK IX.,comrades lavished upon him more than on all the others. He is
5094,BOOK IX.,implacable—and yet if a man’s brother or son has been slain he
5095,BOOK IX.,"will accept a fine by way of amends from him that killed him, and"
5096,BOOK IX.,the wrong-doer having paid in full remains in peace among his own
5097,BOOK IX.,"people; but as for you, Achilles, the gods have put a wicked"
5098,BOOK IX.,"unforgiving spirit in your heart, and this, all about one single"
5099,BOOK IX.,"girl, whereas we now offer you the seven best we have, and much"
5100,BOOK IX.,"else into the bargain. Be then of a more gracious mind, respect"
5101,BOOK IX.,the hospitality of your own roof. We are with you as messengers
5102,BOOK IX.,"from the host of the Danaans, and would fain be held nearest and"
5103,BOOK IX.,dearest to yourself of all the Achaeans.”
5104,BOOK IX.,
5105,BOOK IX.,"“Ajax,” replied Achilles, “noble son of Telamon, you have spoken"
5106,BOOK IX.,"much to my liking, but my blood boils when I think it all over,"
5107,BOOK IX.,and remember how the son of Atreus treated me with contumely as
5108,BOOK IX.,"though I were some vile tramp, and that too in the presence of"
5109,BOOK IX.,"the Argives. Go, then, and deliver your message; say that I will"
5110,BOOK IX.,"have no concern with fighting till Hector, son of noble Priam,"
5111,BOOK IX.,"reaches the tents of the Myrmidons in his murderous course, and"
5112,BOOK IX.,"flings fire upon their ships. For all his lust of battle, I take"
5113,BOOK IX.,it he will be held in check when he is at my own tent and ship.”
5114,BOOK IX.,
5115,BOOK IX.,"On this they took every man his double cup, made their"
5116,BOOK IX.,"drink-offerings, and went back to the ships, Ulysses leading the"
5117,BOOK IX.,way. But Patroclus told his men and the maid-servants to make
5118,BOOK IX.,ready a comfortable bed for Phoenix; they therefore did so with
5119,BOOK IX.,"sheepskins, a rug, and a sheet of fine linen. The old man then"
5120,BOOK IX.,laid himself down and waited till morning came. But Achilles
5121,BOOK IX.,"slept in an inner room, and beside him the daughter of Phorbas"
5122,BOOK IX.,"lovely Diomede, whom he had carried off from Lesbos. Patroclus"
5123,BOOK IX.,"lay on the other side of the room, and with him fair Iphis whom"
5124,BOOK IX.,Achilles had given him when he took Scyros the city of Enyeus.
5125,BOOK IX.,
5126,BOOK IX.,"When the envoys reached the tents of the son of Atreus, the"
5127,BOOK IX.,"Achaeans rose, pledged them in cups of gold, and began to"
5128,BOOK IX.,"question them. King Agamemnon was the first to do so. “Tell me,"
5129,BOOK IX.,"Ulysses,” said he, “will he save the ships from burning, or did"
5130,BOOK IX.,"he refuse, and is he still furious?”"
5131,BOOK IX.,
5132,BOOK IX.,"Ulysses answered, “Most noble son of Atreus, king of men,"
5133,BOOK IX.,"Agamemnon, Achilles will not be calmed, but is more fiercely"
5134,BOOK IX.,"angry than ever, and spurns both you and your gifts. He bids you"
5135,BOOK IX.,take counsel with the Achaeans to save the ships and host as you
5136,BOOK IX.,"best may; as for himself, he said that at daybreak he should draw"
5137,BOOK IX.,his ships into the water. He said further that he should advise
5138,BOOK IX.,"every one to sail home likewise, for that you will not reach the"
5139,BOOK IX.,"goal of Ilius. ‘Jove,’ he said, ‘has laid his hand over the city"
5140,BOOK IX.,"to protect it, and the people have taken heart.’ This is what he"
5141,BOOK IX.,"said, and the others who were with me can tell you the same"
5142,BOOK IX.,"story—Ajax and the two heralds, men, both of them, who may be"
5143,BOOK IX.,"trusted. The old man Phoenix stayed where he was to sleep, for so"
5144,BOOK IX.,"Achilles would have it, that he might go home with him in the"
5145,BOOK IX.,morning if he so would; but he will not take him by force.”
5146,BOOK IX.,
5147,BOOK IX.,"They all held their peace, sitting for a long time silent and"
5148,BOOK IX.,"dejected, by reason of the sternness with which Achilles had"
5149,BOOK IX.,"refused them, till presently Diomed said, “Most noble son of"
5150,BOOK IX.,"Atreus, king of men, Agamemnon, you ought not to have sued the"
5151,BOOK IX.,"son of Peleus nor offered him gifts. He is proud enough as it is,"
5152,BOOK IX.,and you have encouraged him in his pride still further. Let him
5153,BOOK IX.,stay or go as he will. He will fight later when he is in the
5154,BOOK IX.,"humour, and heaven puts it in his mind to do so. Now, therefore,"
5155,BOOK IX.,"let us all do as I say; we have eaten and drunk our fill, let us"
5156,BOOK IX.,"then take our rest, for in rest there is both strength and stay."
5157,BOOK IX.,"But when fair rosy-fingered morn appears, forthwith bring out"
5158,BOOK IX.,"your host and your horsemen in front of the ships, urging them"
5159,BOOK IX.,"on, and yourself fighting among the foremost.”"
5160,BOOK IX.,
5161,BOOK IX.,"Thus he spoke, and the other chieftains approved his words. They"
5162,BOOK IX.,then made their drink-offerings and went every man to his own
5163,BOOK IX.,"tent, where they laid down to rest and enjoyed the boon of sleep."
5164,BOOK IX.,
5165,BOOK IX.,
5166,BOOK IX.,
5167,BOOK IX.,
5168,BOOK X.,BOOK X.
5169,BOOK X.,
5170,BOOK X.,
5171,BOOK X.,"Ulysses and Diomed go out as spies, and meet Dolon, who gives"
5172,BOOK X.,"them information: they then kill him, and profiting by what he"
5173,BOOK X.,"had told them, kill Rhesus king of the Thracians and take his"
5174,BOOK X.,horses.
5175,BOOK X.,
5176,BOOK X.,Now the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the whole
5177,BOOK X.,"night through, but Agamemnon son of Atreus was troubled, so that"
5178,BOOK X.,he could get no rest. As when fair Juno’s lord flashes his
5179,BOOK X.,lightning in token of great rain or hail or snow when the
5180,BOOK X.,"snow-flakes whiten the ground, or again as a sign that he will"
5181,BOOK X.,"open the wide jaws of hungry war, even so did Agamemnon heave"
5182,BOOK X.,"many a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled within him. When he"
5183,BOOK X.,looked upon the plain of Troy he marvelled at the many watchfires
5184,BOOK X.,"burning in front of Ilius, and at the sound of pipes and flutes"
5185,BOOK X.,"and of the hum of men, but when presently he turned towards the"
5186,BOOK X.,"ships and hosts of the Achaeans, he tore his hair by handfuls"
5187,BOOK X.,"before Jove on high, and groaned aloud for the very disquietness"
5188,BOOK X.,of his soul. In the end he deemed it best to go at once to Nestor
5189,BOOK X.,"son of Neleus, and see if between them they could find any way of"
5190,BOOK X.,"the Achaeans from destruction. He therefore rose, put on his"
5191,BOOK X.,"shirt, bound his sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of"
5192,BOOK X.,a huge tawny lion over his shoulders—a skin that reached his
5193,BOOK X.,feet—and took his spear in his hand.
5194,BOOK X.,
5195,BOOK X.,"Neither could Menelaus sleep, for he, too, boded ill for the"
5196,BOOK X.,Argives who for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to
5197,BOOK X.,fight the Trojans. He covered his broad back with the skin of a
5198,BOOK X.,"spotted panther, put a casque of bronze upon his head, and took"
5199,BOOK X.,"his spear in his brawny hand. Then he went to rouse his brother,"
5200,BOOK X.,"who was by far the most powerful of the Achaeans, and was"
5201,BOOK X.,honoured by the people as though he were a god. He found him by
5202,BOOK X.,the stern of his ship already putting his goodly array about his
5203,BOOK X.,"shoulders, and right glad was he that his brother had come."
5204,BOOK X.,
5205,BOOK X.,"Menelaus spoke first. “Why,” said he, “my dear brother, are you"
5206,BOOK X.,thus arming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to exploit
5207,BOOK X.,"the Trojans? I greatly fear that no one will do you this service,"
5208,BOOK X.,and spy upon the enemy alone in the dead of night. It will be a
5209,BOOK X.,deed of great daring.”
5210,BOOK X.,
5211,BOOK X.,"And King Agamemnon answered, “Menelaus, we both of us need shrewd"
5212,BOOK X.,"counsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed"
5213,BOOK X.,"his mind, and inclines towards Hector’s sacrifices rather than"
5214,BOOK X.,ours. I never saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought
5215,BOOK X.,such ruin in one day as Hector has now wrought against the sons
5216,BOOK X.,"of the Achaeans—and that too of his own unaided self, for he is"
5217,BOOK X.,son neither to god nor goddess. The Argives will rue it long and
5218,BOOK X.,"deeply. Run, therefore, with all speed by the line of the ships,"
5219,BOOK X.,"and call Ajax and Idomeneus. Meanwhile I will go to Nestor, and"
5220,BOOK X.,bid him rise and go about among the companies of our sentinels to
5221,BOOK X.,give them their instructions; they will listen to him sooner than
5222,BOOK X.,"to any man, for his own son, and Meriones brother in arms to"
5223,BOOK X.,"Idomeneus, are captains over them. It was to them more"
5224,BOOK X.,particularly that we gave this charge.”
5225,BOOK X.,
5226,BOOK X.,"Menelaus replied, “How do I take your meaning? Am I to stay with"
5227,BOOK X.,"them and wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as I"
5228,BOOK X.,"have given your orders?” “Wait,” answered King Agamemnon, “for"
5229,BOOK X.,there are so many paths about the camp that we might miss one
5230,BOOK X.,"another. Call every man on your way, and bid him be stirring;"
5231,BOOK X.,"name him by his lineage and by his father’s name, give each all"
5232,BOOK X.,"titular observance, and stand not too much upon your own dignity;"
5233,BOOK X.,"we must take our full share of toil, for at our birth Jove laid"
5234,BOOK X.,this heavy burden upon us.”
5235,BOOK X.,
5236,BOOK X.,"With these instructions he sent his brother on his way, and went"
5237,BOOK X.,on to Nestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in his
5238,BOOK X.,tent hard by his own ship; his goodly armour lay beside him—his
5239,BOOK X.,"shield, his two spears and his helmet; beside him also lay the"
5240,BOOK X.,gleaming girdle with which the old man girded himself when he
5241,BOOK X.,armed to lead his people into battle—for his age stayed him not.
5242,BOOK X.,He raised himself on his elbow and looked up at Agamemnon. “Who
5243,BOOK X.,"is it,” said he, “that goes thus about the host and the ships"
5244,BOOK X.,"alone and in the dead of night, when men are sleeping? Are you"
5245,BOOK X.,looking for one of your mules or for some comrade? Do not stand
5246,BOOK X.,"there and say nothing, but speak. What is your business?”"
5247,BOOK X.,
5248,BOOK X.,"And Agamemnon answered, “Nestor, son of Neleus, honour to the"
5249,BOOK X.,"Achaean name, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Jove has"
5250,BOOK X.,laid labour and sorrow so long as there is breath in my body and
5251,BOOK X.,my limbs carry me. I am thus abroad because sleep sits not upon
5252,BOOK X.,"my eyelids, but my heart is big with war and with the jeopardy of"
5253,BOOK X.,"the Achaeans. I am in great fear for the Danaans. I am at sea,"
5254,BOOK X.,and without sure counsel; my heart beats as though it would leap
5255,BOOK X.,"out of my body, and my limbs fail me. If then you can do"
5256,BOOK X.,anything—for you too cannot sleep—let us go the round of the
5257,BOOK X.,"watch, and see whether they are drowsy with toil and sleeping to"
5258,BOOK X.,the neglect of their duty. The enemy is encamped hard and we know
5259,BOOK X.,not but he may attack us by night.”
5260,BOOK X.,
5261,BOOK X.,"Nestor replied, “Most noble son of Atreus, king of men,"
5262,BOOK X.,"Agamemnon, Jove will not do all for Hector that Hector thinks he"
5263,BOOK X.,will; he will have troubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay
5264,BOOK X.,"aside his anger. I will go with you, and we will rouse others,"
5265,BOOK X.,"either the son of Tydeus, or Ulysses, or fleet Ajax and the"
5266,BOOK X.,valiant son of Phyleus. Some one had also better go and call Ajax
5267,BOOK X.,"and King Idomeneus, for their ships are not near at hand but the"
5268,BOOK X.,"farthest of all. I cannot however refrain from blaming Menelaus,"
5269,BOOK X.,"much as I love him and respect him—and I will say so plainly,"
5270,BOOK X.,even at the risk of offending you—for sleeping and leaving all
5271,BOOK X.,this trouble to yourself. He ought to be going about imploring
5272,BOOK X.,"aid from all the princes of the Achaeans, for we are in extreme"
5273,BOOK X.,danger.”
5274,BOOK X.,
5275,BOOK X.,"And Agamemnon answered, “Sir, you may sometimes blame him justly,"
5276,BOOK X.,for he is often remiss and unwilling to exert himself—not indeed
5277,BOOK X.,"from sloth, nor yet heedlessness, but because he looks to me and"
5278,BOOK X.,"expects me to take the lead. On this occasion, however, he was"
5279,BOOK X.,"awake before I was, and came to me of his own accord. I have"
5280,BOOK X.,already sent him to call the very men whom you have named. And
5281,BOOK X.,now let us be going. We shall find them with the watch outside
5282,BOOK X.,"the gates, for it was there I said that we would meet them.”"
5283,BOOK X.,
5284,BOOK X.,"“In that case,” answered Nestor, “the Argives will not blame him"
5285,BOOK X.,nor disobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives them
5286,BOOK X.,instructions.”
5287,BOOK X.,
5288,BOOK X.,"With this he put on his shirt, and bound his sandals about his"
5289,BOOK X.,"comely feet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two thicknesses,"
5290,BOOK X.,"large, and of a rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable"
5291,BOOK X.,"bronze-shod spear, and wended his way along the line of the"
5292,BOOK X.,Achaean ships. First he called loudly to Ulysses peer of gods in
5293,BOOK X.,"counsel and woke him, for he was soon roused by the sound of the"
5294,BOOK X.,"battle-cry. He came outside his tent and said, “Why do you go"
5295,BOOK X.,"thus alone about the host, and along the line of the ships in the"
5296,BOOK X.,stillness of the night? What is it that you find so urgent?” And
5297,BOOK X.,"Nestor knight of Gerene answered, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,"
5298,BOOK X.,"take it not amiss, for the Achaeans are in great straits. Come"
5299,BOOK X.,"with me and let us wake some other, who may advise well with us"
5300,BOOK X.,whether we shall fight or fly.”
5301,BOOK X.,
5302,BOOK X.,"On this Ulysses went at once into his tent, put his shield about"
5303,BOOK X.,his shoulders and came out with them. First they went to Diomed
5304,BOOK X.,"son of Tydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armour"
5305,BOOK X.,with his comrades sleeping round him and using their shields as
5306,BOOK X.,"pillows; as for their spears, they stood upright on the spikes of"
5307,BOOK X.,"their butts that were driven into the ground, and the burnished"
5308,BOOK X.,bronze flashed afar like the lightning of father Jove. The hero
5309,BOOK X.,"was sleeping upon the skin of an ox, with a piece of fine carpet"
5310,BOOK X.,under his head; Nestor went up to him and stirred him with his
5311,BOOK X.,"heel to rouse him, upbraiding him and urging him to bestir"
5312,BOOK X.,"himself. “Wake up,” he exclaimed, “son of Tydeus. How can you"
5313,BOOK X.,sleep on in this way? Can you not see that the Trojans are
5314,BOOK X.,"encamped on the brow of the plain hard by our ships, with but a"
5315,BOOK X.,little space between us and them?”
5316,BOOK X.,
5317,BOOK X.,"On these words Diomed leaped up instantly and said, “Old man,"
5318,BOOK X.,your heart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labours.
5319,BOOK X.,Are there no younger men among the Achaeans who could go about to
5320,BOOK X.,rouse the princes? There is no tiring you.”
5321,BOOK X.,
5322,BOOK X.,"And Nestor knight of Gerene made answer, “My son, all that you"
5323,BOOK X.,"have said is true. I have good sons, and also much people who"
5324,BOOK X.,"might call the chieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest"
5325,BOOK X.,danger; life and death are balanced as it were on the edge of a
5326,BOOK X.,"razor. Go then, for you are younger than I, and of your courtesy"
5327,BOOK X.,rouse Ajax and the fleet son of Phyleus.”
5328,BOOK X.,
5329,BOOK X.,Diomed threw the skin of a great tawny lion about his shoulders—a
5330,BOOK X.,skin that reached his feet—and grasped his spear. When he had
5331,BOOK X.,"roused the heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went"
5332,BOOK X.,"the round of those who were on guard, and found the captains not"
5333,BOOK X.,sleeping at their posts but wakeful and sitting with their arms
5334,BOOK X.,about them. As sheep dogs that watch their flocks when they are
5335,BOOK X.,"yarded, and hear a wild beast coming through the mountain forest"
5336,BOOK X.,"towards them—forthwith there is a hue and cry of dogs and men,"
5337,BOOK X.,and slumber is broken—even so was sleep chased from the eyes of
5338,BOOK X.,"the Achaeans as they kept the watches of the wicked night, for"
5339,BOOK X.,they turned constantly towards the plain whenever they heard any
5340,BOOK X.,stir among the Trojans. The old man was glad and bade them be of
5341,BOOK X.,"good cheer. “Watch on, my children,” said he, “and let not sleep"
5342,BOOK X.,"get hold upon you, lest our enemies triumph over us.”"
5343,BOOK X.,
5344,BOOK X.,"With this he passed the trench, and with him the other chiefs of"
5345,BOOK X.,the Achaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones and the
5346,BOOK X.,"brave son of Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When"
5347,BOOK X.,they were beyond the trench that was dug round the wall they held
5348,BOOK X.,their meeting on the open ground where there was a space clear of
5349,BOOK X.,"corpses, for it was here that when night fell Hector had turned"
5350,BOOK X.,"back from his onslaught on the Argives. They sat down, therefore,"
5351,BOOK X.,and held debate with one another.
5352,BOOK X.,
5353,BOOK X.,"Nestor spoke first. “My friends,” said he, “is there any man bold"
5354,BOOK X.,"enough to venture among the Trojans, and cut off some straggler,"
5355,BOOK X.,or bring us news of what the enemy mean to do whether they will
5356,BOOK X.,"stay here by the ships away from the city, or whether, now that"
5357,BOOK X.,"they have worsted the Achaeans, they will retire within their"
5358,BOOK X.,"walls. If he could learn all this and come back safely here, his"
5359,BOOK X.,"fame would be high as heaven in the mouths of all men, and he"
5360,BOOK X.,would be rewarded richly; for the chiefs from all our ships would
5361,BOOK X.,each of them give him a black ewe with her lamb—which is a
5362,BOOK X.,present of surpassing value—and he would be asked as a guest to
5363,BOOK X.,all feasts and clan-gatherings.”
5364,BOOK X.,
5365,BOOK X.,"They all held their peace, but Diomed of the loud war-cry spoke"
5366,BOOK X.,"saying, “Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans over"
5367,BOOK X.,"against us, but if another will go with me I shall do so in"
5368,BOOK X.,"greater confidence and comfort. When two men are together, one of"
5369,BOOK X.,them may see some opportunity which the other has not caught
5370,BOOK X.,"sight of; if a man is alone he is less full of resource, and his"
5371,BOOK X.,wit is weaker.”
5372,BOOK X.,
5373,BOOK X.,"On this several offered to go with Diomed. The two Ajaxes,"
5374,BOOK X.,"servants of Mars, Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to"
5375,BOOK X.,"go, so did Menelaus son of Atreus; Ulysses also wished to go"
5376,BOOK X.,"among the host of the Trojans, for he was ever full of daring,"
5377,BOOK X.,"and thereon Agamemnon king of men spoke thus: “Diomed,” said he,"
5378,BOOK X.,"“son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, choose your comrade for"
5379,BOOK X.,"yourself—take the best man of those that have offered, for many"
5380,BOOK X.,would now go with you. Do not through delicacy reject the better
5381,BOOK X.,"man, and take the worst out of respect for his lineage, because"
5382,BOOK X.,he is of more royal blood.”
5383,BOOK X.,
5384,BOOK X.,"He said this because he feared for Menelaus. Diomed answered, “If"
5385,BOOK X.,"you bid me take the man of my own choice, how in that case can I"
5386,BOOK X.,"fail to think of Ulysses, than whom there is no man more eager to"
5387,BOOK X.,face all kinds of danger—and Pallas Minerva loves him well? If he
5388,BOOK X.,"were to go with me we should pass safely through fire itself, for"
5389,BOOK X.,he is quick to see and understand.”
5390,BOOK X.,
5391,BOOK X.,"“Son of Tydeus,” replied Ulysses, “say neither good nor ill about"
5392,BOOK X.,"me, for you are among Argives who know me well. Let us be going,"
5393,BOOK X.,for the night wanes and dawn is at hand. The stars have gone
5394,BOOK X.,"forward, two-thirds of the night are already spent, and the third"
5395,BOOK X.,is alone left us.”
5396,BOOK X.,
5397,BOOK X.,They then put on their armour. Brave Thrasymedes provided the son
5398,BOOK X.,of Tydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own at
5399,BOOK X.,his ship) and on his head he set a helmet of bull’s hide without
5400,BOOK X.,either peak or crest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common
5401,BOOK X.,"headgear. Meriones found a bow and quiver for Ulysses, and on his"
5402,BOOK X.,head he set a leathern helmet that was lined with a strong
5403,BOOK X.,"plaiting of leathern thongs, while on the outside it was thickly"
5404,BOOK X.,"studded with boar’s teeth, well and skilfully set into it; next"
5405,BOOK X.,the head there was an inner lining of felt. This helmet had been
5406,BOOK X.,stolen by Autolycus out of Eleon when he broke into the house of
5407,BOOK X.,Amyntor son of Ormenus. He gave it to Amphidamas of Cythera to
5408,BOOK X.,"take to Scandea, and Amphidamas gave it as a guest-gift to Molus,"
5409,BOOK X.,who gave it to his son Meriones; and now it was set upon the head
5410,BOOK X.,of Ulysses.
5411,BOOK X.,
5412,BOOK X.,"When the pair had armed, they set out, and left the other"
5413,BOOK X.,chieftains behind them. Pallas Minerva sent them a heron by the
5414,BOOK X.,wayside upon their right hands; they could not see it for the
5415,BOOK X.,"darkness, but they heard its cry. Ulysses was glad when he heard"
5416,BOOK X.,"it and prayed to Minerva: “Hear me,” he cried, “daughter of"
5417,BOOK X.,"aegis-bearing Jove, you who spy out all my ways and who are with"
5418,BOOK X.,"me in all my hardships; befriend me in this mine hour, and grant"
5419,BOOK X.,that we may return to the ships covered with glory after having
5420,BOOK X.,achieved some mighty exploit that shall bring sorrow to the
5421,BOOK X.,Trojans.”
5422,BOOK X.,
5423,BOOK X.,"Then Diomed of the loud war-cry also prayed: “Hear me too,” said"
5424,BOOK X.,"he, “daughter of Jove, unweariable; be with me even as you were"
5425,BOOK X.,with my noble father Tydeus when he went to Thebes as envoy sent
5426,BOOK X.,by the Achaeans. He left the Achaeans by the banks of the river
5427,BOOK X.,"Aesopus, and went to the city bearing a message of peace to the"
5428,BOOK X.,"Cadmeians; on his return thence, with your help, goddess, he did"
5429,BOOK X.,"great deeds of daring, for you were his ready helper. Even so"
5430,BOOK X.,"guide me and guard me now, and in return I will offer you in"
5431,BOOK X.,"sacrifice a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and"
5432,BOOK X.,never yet brought by man under the yoke. I will gild her horns
5433,BOOK X.,and will offer her up to you in sacrifice.”
5434,BOOK X.,
5435,BOOK X.,"Thus they prayed, and Pallas Minerva heard their prayer. When"
5436,BOOK X.,"they had done praying to the daughter of great Jove, they went"
5437,BOOK X.,their way like two lions prowling by night amid the armour and
5438,BOOK X.,blood-stained bodies of them that had fallen.
5439,BOOK X.,
5440,BOOK X.,Neither again did Hector let the Trojans sleep; for he too called
5441,BOOK X.,the princes and councillors of the Trojans that he might set his
5442,BOOK X.,"counsel before them. “Is there one,” said he, “who for a great"
5443,BOOK X.,reward will do me the service of which I will tell you? He shall
5444,BOOK X.,be well paid if he will. I will give him a chariot and a couple
5445,BOOK X.,"of horses, the fleetest that can be found at the ships of the"
5446,BOOK X.,"Achaeans, if he will dare this thing; and he will win infinite"
5447,BOOK X.,honour to boot; he must go to the ships and find out whether they
5448,BOOK X.,"are still guarded as heretofore, or whether now that we have"
5449,BOOK X.,"beaten them the Achaeans design to fly, and through sheer"
5450,BOOK X.,exhaustion are neglecting to keep their watches.”
5451,BOOK X.,
5452,BOOK X.,They all held their peace; but there was among the Trojans a
5453,BOOK X.,"certain man named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald—a man"
5454,BOOK X.,"rich in gold and bronze. He was ill-favoured, but a good runner,"
5455,BOOK X.,and was an only son among five sisters. He it was that now
5456,BOOK X.,"addressed the Trojans. “I, Hector,” said he, “Will to the ships"
5457,BOOK X.,and will exploit them. But first hold up your sceptre and swear
5458,BOOK X.,"that you will give me the chariot, bedight with bronze, and the"
5459,BOOK X.,horses that now carry the noble son of Peleus. I will make you a
5460,BOOK X.,"good scout, and will not fail you. I will go through the host"
5461,BOOK X.,"from one end to the other till I come to the ship of Agamemnon,"
5462,BOOK X.,where I take it the princes of the Achaeans are now consulting
5463,BOOK X.,whether they shall fight or fly.”
5464,BOOK X.,
5465,BOOK X.,"When he had done speaking Hector held up his sceptre, and swore"
5466,BOOK X.,"him his oath saying, “May Jove the thundering husband of Juno"
5467,BOOK X.,bear witness that no other Trojan but yourself shall mount those
5468,BOOK X.,"steeds, and that you shall have your will with them for ever.”"
5469,BOOK X.,
5470,BOOK X.,"The oath he swore was bootless, but it made Dolon more keen on"
5471,BOOK X.,"going. He hung his bow over his shoulder, and as an overall he"
5472,BOOK X.,"wore the skin of a grey wolf, while on his head he set a cap of"
5473,BOOK X.,"ferret skin. Then he took a pointed javelin, and left the camp"
5474,BOOK X.,"for the ships, but he was not to return with any news for Hector."
5475,BOOK X.,"When he had left the horses and the troops behind him, he made"
5476,BOOK X.,"all speed on his way, but Ulysses perceived his coming and said"
5477,BOOK X.,"to Diomed, “Diomed, here is some one from the camp; I am not sure"
5478,BOOK X.,"whether he is a spy, or whether it is some thief who would"
5479,BOOK X.,"plunder the bodies of the dead; let him get a little past us, we"
5480,BOOK X.,"can then spring upon him and take him. If, however, he is too"
5481,BOOK X.,"quick for us, go after him with your spear and hem him in towards"
5482,BOOK X.,"the ships away from the Trojan camp, to prevent his getting back"
5483,BOOK X.,to the town.”
5484,BOOK X.,
5485,BOOK X.,With this they turned out of their way and lay down among the
5486,BOOK X.,"corpses. Dolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when"
5487,BOOK X.,he had got about as far as the distance by which a mule-plowed
5488,BOOK X.,furrow exceeds one that has been ploughed by oxen (for mules can
5489,BOOK X.,"plow fallow land quicker than oxen) they ran after him, and when"
5490,BOOK X.,"he heard their footsteps he stood still, for he made sure they"
5491,BOOK X.,were friends from the Trojan camp come by Hector’s orders to bid
5492,BOOK X.,"him return; when, however, they were only a spear’s cast, or"
5493,BOOK X.,"less, away from him, he saw that they were enemies and ran as"
5494,BOOK X.,"fast as his legs could take him. The others gave chase at once,"
5495,BOOK X.,and as a couple of well-trained hounds press forward after a doe
5496,BOOK X.,"or hare that runs screaming in front of them, even so did the son"
5497,BOOK X.,of Tydeus and Ulysses pursue Dolon and cut him off from his own
5498,BOOK X.,people. But when he had fled so far towards the ships that he
5499,BOOK X.,"would soon have fallen in with the outposts, Minerva infused"
5500,BOOK X.,fresh strength into the son of Tydeus for fear some other of the
5501,BOOK X.,"Achaeans might have the glory of being first to hit him, and he"
5502,BOOK X.,might himself be only second; he therefore sprang forward with
5503,BOOK X.,"his spear and said, “Stand, or I shall throw my spear, and in"
5504,BOOK X.,that case I shall soon make an end of you.”
5505,BOOK X.,
5506,BOOK X.,"He threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on purpose. The dart"
5507,BOOK X.,"flew over the man’s right shoulder, and then stuck in the ground."
5508,BOOK X.,"He stood stock still, trembling and in great fear; his teeth"
5509,BOOK X.,"chattered, and he turned pale with fear. The two came breathless"
5510,BOOK X.,"up to him and seized his hands, whereon he began to weep and"
5511,BOOK X.,"said, “Take me alive; I will ransom myself; we have great store"
5512,BOOK X.,"of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this my father will"
5513,BOOK X.,"satisfy you with a very large ransom, should he hear of my being"
5514,BOOK X.,alive at the ships of the Achaeans.”
5515,BOOK X.,
5516,BOOK X.,"“Fear not,” replied Ulysses, “let no thought of death be in your"
5517,BOOK X.,"mind; but tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going about"
5518,BOOK X.,alone in the dead of night away from your camp and towards the
5519,BOOK X.,"ships, while other men are sleeping? Is it to plunder the bodies"
5520,BOOK X.,"of the slain, or did Hector send you to spy out what was going on"
5521,BOOK X.,at the ships? Or did you come here of your own mere notion?”
5522,BOOK X.,
5523,BOOK X.,"Dolon answered, his limbs trembling beneath him: “Hector, with"
5524,BOOK X.,"his vain flattering promises, lured me from my better judgement."
5525,BOOK X.,He said he would give me the horses of the noble son of Peleus
5526,BOOK X.,and his bronze-bedizened chariot; he bade me go through the
5527,BOOK X.,"darkness of the flying night, get close to the enemy, and find"
5528,BOOK X.,"out whether the ships are still guarded as heretofore, or"
5529,BOOK X.,"whether, now that we have beaten them, the Achaeans design to"
5530,BOOK X.,"fly, and through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep their"
5531,BOOK X.,watches.”
5532,BOOK X.,
5533,BOOK X.,"Ulysses smiled at him and answered, “You had indeed set your"
5534,BOOK X.,"heart upon a great reward, but the horses of the descendant of"
5535,BOOK X.,Aeacus are hardly to be kept in hand or driven by any other
5536,BOOK X.,"mortal man than Achilles himself, whose mother was an immortal."
5537,BOOK X.,"But tell me, and tell me true, where did you leave Hector when"
5538,BOOK X.,"you started? Where lies his armour and his horses? How, too, are"
5539,BOOK X.,the watches and sleeping-ground of the Trojans ordered? What are
5540,BOOK X.,their plans? Will they stay here by the ships and away from the
5541,BOOK X.,"city, or now that they have worsted the Achaeans, will they"
5542,BOOK X.,retire within their walls?”
5543,BOOK X.,
5544,BOOK X.,"And Dolon answered, “I will tell you truly all. Hector and the"
5545,BOOK X.,other councillors are now holding conference by the monument of
5546,BOOK X.,"great Ilus, away from the general tumult; as for the guards about"
5547,BOOK X.,"which you ask me, there is no chosen watch to keep guard over the"
5548,BOOK X.,"host. The Trojans have their watchfires, for they are bound to"
5549,BOOK X.,"have them; they, therefore, are awake and keep each other to"
5550,BOOK X.,their duty as sentinels; but the allies who have come from other
5551,BOOK X.,"places are asleep and leave it to the Trojans to keep guard, for"
5552,BOOK X.,their wives and children are not here.”
5553,BOOK X.,
5554,BOOK X.,"Ulysses then said, “Now tell me; are they sleeping among the"
5555,BOOK X.,"Trojan troops, or do they lie apart? Explain this that I may"
5556,BOOK X.,understand it.”
5557,BOOK X.,
5558,BOOK X.,"“I will tell you truly all,” replied Dolon. “To the seaward lie"
5559,BOOK X.,"the Carians, the Paeonian bowmen, the Leleges, the Cauconians,"
5560,BOOK X.,"and the noble Pelasgi. The Lycians and proud Mysians, with the"
5561,BOOK X.,"Phrygians and Meonians, have their place on the side towards"
5562,BOOK X.,Thymbra; but why ask about all this? If you want to find your way
5563,BOOK X.,"into the host of the Trojans, there are the Thracians, who have"
5564,BOOK X.,lately come here and lie apart from the others at the far end of
5565,BOOK X.,the camp; and they have Rhesus son of Eioneus for their king. His
5566,BOOK X.,"horses are the finest and strongest that I have ever seen, they"
5567,BOOK X.,are whiter than snow and fleeter than any wind that blows. His
5568,BOOK X.,"chariot is bedight with silver and gold, and he has brought his"
5569,BOOK X.,"marvellous golden armour, of the rarest workmanship—too splendid"
5570,BOOK X.,"for any mortal man to carry, and meet only for the gods. Now,"
5571,BOOK X.,"therefore, take me to the ships or bind me securely here, until"
5572,BOOK X.,you come back and have proved my words whether they be false or
5573,BOOK X.,true.”
5574,BOOK X.,
5575,BOOK X.,"Diomed looked sternly at him and answered, “Think not, Dolon, for"
5576,BOOK X.,"all the good information you have given us, that you shall escape"
5577,BOOK X.,"now you are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you"
5578,BOOK X.,will come some second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as
5579,BOOK X.,"a spy or as an open enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you,"
5580,BOOK X.,you will give no more trouble.”
5581,BOOK X.,
5582,BOOK X.,On this Dolon would have caught him by the beard to beseech him
5583,BOOK X.,"further, but Diomed struck him in the middle of his neck with his"
5584,BOOK X.,sword and cut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling
5585,BOOK X.,in the dust while he was yet speaking. They took the ferret skin
5586,BOOK X.,"cap from his head, and also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long"
5587,BOOK X.,spear. Ulysses hung them up aloft in honour of Minerva the
5588,BOOK X.,"goddess of plunder, and prayed saying, “Accept these, goddess,"
5589,BOOK X.,for we give them to you in preference to all the gods in Olympus:
5590,BOOK X.,therefore speed us still further towards the horses and
5591,BOOK X.,sleeping-ground of the Thracians.”
5592,BOOK X.,
5593,BOOK X.,With these words he took the spoils and set them upon a tamarisk
5594,BOOK X.,"tree, and they marked the place by pulling up reeds and gathering"
5595,BOOK X.,boughs of tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back
5596,BOOK X.,through the flying hours of darkness. The two then went onwards
5597,BOOK X.,"amid the fallen armour and the blood, and came presently to the"
5598,BOOK X.,"company of Thracian soldiers, who were sleeping, tired out with"
5599,BOOK X.,their day’s toil; their goodly armour was lying on the ground
5600,BOOK X.,"beside them all orderly in three rows, and each man had his yoke"
5601,BOOK X.,"of horses beside him. Rhesus was sleeping in the middle, and hard"
5602,BOOK X.,by him his horses were made fast to the topmost rim of his
5603,BOOK X.,"chariot. Ulysses from some way off saw him and said, “This,"
5604,BOOK X.,"Diomed, is the man, and these are the horses about which Dolon"
5605,BOOK X.,whom we killed told us. Do your very utmost; dally not about your
5606,BOOK X.,"armour, but loose the horses at once—or else kill the men"
5607,BOOK X.,"yourself, while I see to the horses.”"
5608,BOOK X.,
5609,BOOK X.,"Thereon Minerva put courage into the heart of Diomed, and he"
5610,BOOK X.,smote them right and left. They made a hideous groaning as they
5611,BOOK X.,"were being hacked about, and the earth was red with their blood."
5612,BOOK X.,As a lion springs furiously upon a flock of sheep or goats when
5613,BOOK X.,"he finds them without their shepherd, so did the son of Tydeus"
5614,BOOK X.,set upon the Thracian soldiers till he had killed twelve. As he
5615,BOOK X.,killed them Ulysses came and drew them aside by their feet one by
5616,BOOK X.,"one, that the horses might go forward freely without being"
5617,BOOK X.,"frightened as they passed over the dead bodies, for they were not"
5618,BOOK X.,"yet used to them. When the son of Tydeus came to the king, he"
5619,BOOK X.,"killed him too (which made thirteen), as he was breathing hard,"
5620,BOOK X.,"for by the counsel of Minerva an evil dream, the seed of Oeneus,"
5621,BOOK X.,hovered that night over his head. Meanwhile Ulysses untied the
5622,BOOK X.,"horses, made them fast one to another and drove them off,"
5623,BOOK X.,"striking them with his bow, for he had forgotten to take the whip"
5624,BOOK X.,from the chariot. Then he whistled as a sign to Diomed.
5625,BOOK X.,
5626,BOOK X.,"But Diomed stayed where he was, thinking what other daring deed"
5627,BOOK X.,he might accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the chariot
5628,BOOK X.,"in which the king’s armour was lying, and draw it out by the"
5629,BOOK X.,"pole, or to lift the armour out and carry it off; or whether"
5630,BOOK X.,"again, he should not kill some more Thracians. While he was thus"
5631,BOOK X.,"hesitating Minerva came up to him and said, “Get back, Diomed, to"
5632,BOOK X.,"the ships or you may be driven thither, should some other god"
5633,BOOK X.,rouse the Trojans.”
5634,BOOK X.,
5635,BOOK X.,"Diomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the"
5636,BOOK X.,horses. Ulysses beat them with his bow and they flew onward to
5637,BOOK X.,the ships of the Achaeans.
5638,BOOK X.,
5639,BOOK X.,But Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw Minerva with the
5640,BOOK X.,"son of Tydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of"
5641,BOOK X.,"the Trojans he roused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians"
5642,BOOK X.,and a noble kinsman of Rhesus. He started up out of his sleep and
5643,BOOK X.,"saw that the horses were no longer in their place, and that the"
5644,BOOK X.,"men were gasping in their death-agony; on this he groaned aloud,"
5645,BOOK X.,and called upon his friend by name. Then the whole Trojan camp
5646,BOOK X.,"was in an uproar as the people kept hurrying together, and they"
5647,BOOK X.,marvelled at the deeds of the heroes who had now got away towards
5648,BOOK X.,the ships.
5649,BOOK X.,
5650,BOOK X.,"When they reached the place where they had killed Hector’s scout,"
5651,BOOK X.,"Ulysses stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus, leaping to the"
5652,BOOK X.,"ground, placed the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Ulysses"
5653,BOOK X.,"and remounted: then he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew"
5654,BOOK X.,forward nothing loth towards the ships as though of their own
5655,BOOK X.,free will. Nestor was first to hear the tramp of their feet. “My
5656,BOOK X.,"friends,” said he, “princes and counsellors of the Argives, shall"
5657,BOOK X.,I guess right or wrong?—but I must say what I think: there is a
5658,BOOK X.,sound in my ears as of the tramp of horses. I hope it may be
5659,BOOK X.,"Diomed and Ulysses driving in horses from the Trojans, but I much"
5660,BOOK X.,fear that the bravest of the Argives may have come to some harm
5661,BOOK X.,at their hands.”
5662,BOOK X.,
5663,BOOK X.,He had hardly done speaking when the two men came in and
5664,BOOK X.,"dismounted, whereon the others shook hands right gladly with them"
5665,BOOK X.,and congratulated them. Nestor knight of Gerene was first to
5666,BOOK X.,"question them. “Tell me,” said he, “renowned Ulysses, how did you"
5667,BOOK X.,two come by these horses? Did you steal in among the Trojan
5668,BOOK X.,"forces, or did some god meet you and give them to you? They are"
5669,BOOK X.,"like sunbeams. I am well conversant with the Trojans, for old"
5670,BOOK X.,"warrior though I am I never hold back by the ships, but I never"
5671,BOOK X.,yet saw or heard of such horses as these are. Surely some god
5672,BOOK X.,"must have met you and given them to you, for you are both of you"
5673,BOOK X.,"dear to Jove, and to Jove’s daughter Minerva.”"
5674,BOOK X.,
5675,BOOK X.,"And Ulysses answered, “Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the"
5676,BOOK X.,"Achaean name, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better"
5677,BOOK X.,"horses than these, for the gods are far mightier than we are."
5678,BOOK X.,"These horses, however, about which you ask me, are freshly come"
5679,BOOK X.,from Thrace. Diomed killed their king with the twelve bravest of
5680,BOOK X.,his companions. Hard by the ships we took a thirteenth man—a
5681,BOOK X.,scout whom Hector and the other Trojans had sent as a spy upon
5682,BOOK X.,our ships.”
5683,BOOK X.,
5684,BOOK X.,"He laughed as he spoke and drove the horses over the ditch, while"
5685,BOOK X.,the other Achaeans followed him gladly. When they reached the
5686,BOOK X.,"strongly built quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the"
5687,BOOK X.,"horses with thongs of leather to the manger, where the steeds of"
5688,BOOK X.,"Diomed stood eating their sweet corn, but Ulysses hung the"
5689,BOOK X.,"blood-stained spoils of Dolon at the stern of his ship, that they"
5690,BOOK X.,"might prepare a sacred offering to Minerva. As for themselves,"
5691,BOOK X.,"they went into the sea and washed the sweat from their bodies,"
5692,BOOK X.,and from their necks and thighs. When the sea-water had taken all
5693,BOOK X.,"the sweat from off them, and had refreshed them, they went into"
5694,BOOK X.,the baths and washed themselves. After they had so done and had
5695,BOOK X.,"anointed themselves with oil, they sat down to table, and drawing"
5696,BOOK X.,"from a full mixing-bowl, made a drink-offering of wine to"
5697,BOOK X.,Minerva.

5705,BOOK XI.,"In the forenoon the fight is equal, but Agamemnon turns the"

5707,BOOK XI.,leaves the field—Hector then drives everything before him till he
5708,BOOK XI.,"is wounded by Diomed—Paris wounds Diomed—Ulysses, Nestor, and"

5715,BOOK XI.,"And now as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger of"
5716,BOOK XI.,"light alike to mortals and immortals, Jove sent fierce Discord"
5717,BOOK XI.,with the ensign of war in her hands to the ships of the Achaeans.
5718,BOOK XI.,She took her stand by the huge black hull of Ulysses’ ship which
5719,BOOK XI.,"was middlemost of all, so that her voice might carry farthest on"
5720,BOOK XI.,"either side, on the one hand towards the tents of Ajax son of"
5721,BOOK XI.,"Telamon, and on the other towards those of Achilles—for these two"
5722,BOOK XI.,"heroes, well assured of their own strength, had valorously drawn"
5723,BOOK XI.,up their ships at the two ends of the line. There she took her
5724,BOOK XI.,"stand, and raised a cry both loud and shrill that filled the"
5725,BOOK XI.,"Achaeans with courage, giving them heart to fight resolutely and"
5726,BOOK XI.,"with all their might, so that they had rather stay there and do"
5727,BOOK XI.,battle than go home in their ships.
5728,BOOK XI.,
5729,BOOK XI.,The son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the Argives gird
5730,BOOK XI.,themselves for battle while he put on his armour. First he girded
5731,BOOK XI.,"his goodly greaves about his legs, making them fast with"
5732,BOOK XI.,ankle-clasps of silver; and about his chest he set the
5733,BOOK XI.,breastplate which Cinyras had once given him as a guest-gift. It
5734,BOOK XI.,had been noised abroad as far as Cyprus that the Achaeans were
5735,BOOK XI.,"about to sail for Troy, and therefore he gave it to the king. It"
5736,BOOK XI.,"had ten courses of dark cyanus, twelve of gold, and ten of tin."
5737,BOOK XI.,There were serpents of cyanus that reared themselves up towards
5738,BOOK XI.,"the neck, three upon either side, like the rainbows which the son"
5739,BOOK XI.,of Saturn has set in heaven as a sign to mortal men. About his
5740,BOOK XI.,"shoulders he threw his sword, studded with bosses of gold; and"
5741,BOOK XI.,the scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold wherewith to hang
5742,BOOK XI.,it. He took moreover the richly-dight shield that covered his
5743,BOOK XI.,"body when he was in battle—fair to see, with ten circles of"
5744,BOOK XI.,bronze running all round it. On the body of the shield there were
5745,BOOK XI.,"twenty bosses of white tin, with another of dark cyanus in the"
5746,BOOK XI.,"middle: this last was made to show a Gorgon’s head, fierce and"
5747,BOOK XI.,"grim, with Rout and Panic on either side. The band for the arm to"
5748,BOOK XI.,"go through was of silver, on which there was a writhing snake of"
5749,BOOK XI.,"cyanus with three heads that sprang from a single neck, and went"
5750,BOOK XI.,"in and out among one another. On his head Agamemnon set a helmet,"
5751,BOOK XI.,"with a peak before and behind, and four plumes of horse-hair that"
5752,BOOK XI.,nodded menacingly above it; then he grasped two redoubtable
5753,BOOK XI.,"bronze-shod spears, and the gleam of his armour shot from him as"
5754,BOOK XI.,"a flame into the firmament, while Juno and Minerva thundered in"
5755,BOOK XI.,honour of the king of rich Mycene.
5756,BOOK XI.,
5757,BOOK XI.,Every man now left his horses in charge of his charioteer to hold
5758,BOOK XI.,"them in readiness by the trench, while he went into battle on"
5759,BOOK XI.,"foot clad in full armour, and a mighty uproar rose on high into"
5760,BOOK XI.,the dawning. The chiefs were armed and at the trench before the
5761,BOOK XI.,"horses got there, but these came up presently. The son of Saturn"
5762,BOOK XI.,"sent a portent of evil sound about their host, and the dew fell"
5763,BOOK XI.,"red with blood, for he was about to send many a brave man"
5764,BOOK XI.,hurrying down to Hades.
5765,BOOK XI.,
5766,BOOK XI.,"The Trojans, on the other side upon the rising slope of the"
5767,BOOK XI.,"plain, were gathered round great Hector, noble Polydamas, Aeneas"
5768,BOOK XI.,"who was honoured by the Trojans like an immortal, and the three"
5769,BOOK XI.,"sons of Antenor, Polybus, Agenor, and young Acamas beauteous as a"
5770,BOOK XI.,"god. Hector’s round shield showed in the front rank, and as some"
5771,BOOK XI.,baneful star that shines for a moment through a rent in the
5772,BOOK XI.,clouds and is again hidden beneath them; even so was Hector now
5773,BOOK XI.,"seen in the front ranks and now again in the hindermost, and his"
5774,BOOK XI.,bronze armour gleamed like the lightning of aegis-bearing Jove.
5775,BOOK XI.,
5776,BOOK XI.,And now as a band of reapers mow swathes of wheat or barley upon
5777,BOOK XI.,"a rich man’s land, and the sheaves fall thick before them, even"
5778,BOOK XI.,so did the Trojans and Achaeans fall upon one another; they were
5779,BOOK XI.,"in no mood for yielding but fought like wolves, and neither side"
5780,BOOK XI.,"got the better of the other. Discord was glad as she beheld them,"
5781,BOOK XI.,for she was the only god that went among them; the others were
5782,BOOK XI.,"not there, but stayed quietly each in his own home among the"
5783,BOOK XI.,dells and valleys of Olympus. All of them blamed the son of
5784,BOOK XI.,"Saturn for wanting to give victory to the Trojans, but father"
5785,BOOK XI.,"Jove heeded them not: he held aloof from all, and sat apart in"
5786,BOOK XI.,"his all-glorious majesty, looking down upon the city of the"
5787,BOOK XI.,"Trojans, the ships of the Achaeans, the gleam of bronze, and"
5788,BOOK XI.,alike upon the slayers and on the slain.
5789,BOOK XI.,
5790,BOOK XI.,"Now so long as the day waxed and it was still morning, their"
5791,BOOK XI.,"darts rained thick on one another and the people perished, but as"
5792,BOOK XI.,the hour drew nigh when a woodman working in some mountain forest
5793,BOOK XI.,will get his midday meal—for he has felled till his hands are
5794,BOOK XI.,"weary; he is tired out, and must now have food—then the Danaans"
5795,BOOK XI.,"with a cry that rang through all their ranks, broke the"
5796,BOOK XI.,"battalions of the enemy. Agamemnon led them on, and slew first"
5797,BOOK XI.,"Bienor, a leader of his people, and afterwards his comrade and"
5798,BOOK XI.,"charioteer Oileus, who sprang from his chariot and was coming"
5799,BOOK XI.,full towards him; but Agamemnon struck him on the forehead with
5800,BOOK XI.,"his spear; his bronze visor was of no avail against the weapon,"
5801,BOOK XI.,"which pierced both bronze and bone, so that his brains were"
5802,BOOK XI.,battered in and he was killed in full fight.
5803,BOOK XI.,
5804,BOOK XI.,Agamemnon stripped their shirts from off them and left them with
5805,BOOK XI.,their breasts all bare to lie where they had fallen. He then went
5806,BOOK XI.,"on to kill Isus and Antiphus two sons of Priam, the one a"
5807,BOOK XI.,"bastard, the other born in wedlock; they were in the same"
5808,BOOK XI.,"chariot—the bastard driving, while noble Antiphus fought beside"
5809,BOOK XI.,him. Achilles had once taken both of them prisoners in the glades
5810,BOOK XI.,"of Ida, and had bound them with fresh withes as they were"
5811,BOOK XI.,"shepherding, but he had taken a ransom for them; now, however,"
5812,BOOK XI.,Agamemnon son of Atreus smote Isus in the chest above the nipple
5813,BOOK XI.,"with his spear, while he struck Antiphus hard by the ear and"
5814,BOOK XI.,threw him from his chariot. Forthwith he stripped their goodly
5815,BOOK XI.,"armour from off them and recognized them, for he had already seen"
5816,BOOK XI.,them at ships when Achilles brought them in from Ida. As a lion
5817,BOOK XI.,fastens on the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his great
5818,BOOK XI.,"jaws, robbing them of their tender life while he on his way back"
5819,BOOK XI.,to his lair—the hind can do nothing for them even though she be
5820,BOOK XI.,"close by, for she is in an agony of fear, and flies through the"
5821,BOOK XI.,"thick forest, sweating, and at her utmost speed before the mighty"
5822,BOOK XI.,"monster—so, no man of the Trojans could help Isus and Antiphus,"
5823,BOOK XI.,for they were themselves flying in panic before the Argives.
5824,BOOK XI.,
5825,BOOK XI.,"Then King Agamemnon took the two sons of Antimachus, Pisander and"
5826,BOOK XI.,brave Hippolochus. It was Antimachus who had been foremost in
5827,BOOK XI.,"preventing Helen’s being restored to Menelaus, for he was largely"
5828,BOOK XI.,"bribed by Alexandrus; and now Agamemnon took his two sons, both"
5829,BOOK XI.,"in the same chariot, trying to bring their horses to a stand—for"
5830,BOOK XI.,they had lost hold of the reins and the horses were mad with
5831,BOOK XI.,"fear. The son of Atreus sprang upon them like a lion, and the"
5832,BOOK XI.,"pair besought him from their chariot. “Take us alive,” they"
5833,BOOK XI.,"cried, “son of Atreus, and you shall receive a great ransom for"
5834,BOOK XI.,"us. Our father Antimachus has great store of gold, bronze, and"
5835,BOOK XI.,"wrought iron, and from this he will satisfy you with a very large"
5836,BOOK XI.,ransom should he hear of our being alive at the ships of the
5837,BOOK XI.,Achaeans.”
5838,BOOK XI.,
5839,BOOK XI.,"With such piteous words and tears did they beseech the king, but"
5840,BOOK XI.,"they heard no pitiful answer in return. “If,” said Agamemnon,"
5841,BOOK XI.,"“you are sons of Antimachus, who once at a council of Trojans"
5842,BOOK XI.,"proposed that Menelaus and Ulysses, who had come to you as"
5843,BOOK XI.,"envoys, should be killed and not suffered to return, you shall"
5844,BOOK XI.,now pay for the foul iniquity of your father.”
5845,BOOK XI.,
5846,BOOK XI.,"As he spoke he felled Pisander from his chariot to the earth,"
5847,BOOK XI.,"smiting him on the chest with his spear, so that he lay face"
5848,BOOK XI.,"uppermost upon the ground. Hippolochus fled, but him too did"
5849,BOOK XI.,Agamemnon smite; he cut off his hands and his head—which he sent
5850,BOOK XI.,rolling in among the crowd as though it were a ball. There he let
5851,BOOK XI.,"them both lie, and wherever the ranks were thickest thither he"
5852,BOOK XI.,"flew, while the other Achaeans followed. Foot soldiers drove the"
5853,BOOK XI.,"foot soldiers of the foe in rout before them, and slew them;"
5854,BOOK XI.,"horsemen did the like by horsemen, and the thundering tramp of"
5855,BOOK XI.,the horses raised a cloud of dust from off the plain. King
5856,BOOK XI.,"Agamemnon followed after, ever slaying them and cheering on the"
5857,BOOK XI.,Achaeans. As when some mighty forest is all ablaze—the eddying
5858,BOOK XI.,gusts whirl fire in all directions till the thickets shrivel and
5859,BOOK XI.,are consumed before the blast of the flame—even so fell the heads
5860,BOOK XI.,"of the flying Trojans before Agamemnon son of Atreus, and many a"
5861,BOOK XI.,noble pair of steeds drew an empty chariot along the highways of
5862,BOOK XI.,"war, for lack of drivers who were lying on the plain, more useful"
5863,BOOK XI.,now to vultures than to their wives.
5864,BOOK XI.,
5865,BOOK XI.,"Jove drew Hector away from the darts and dust, with the carnage"
5866,BOOK XI.,"and din of battle; but the son of Atreus sped onwards, calling"
5867,BOOK XI.,"out lustily to the Danaans. They flew on by the tomb of old Ilus,"
5868,BOOK XI.,"son of Dardanus, in the middle of the plain, and past the place"
5869,BOOK XI.,of the wild fig-tree making always for the city—the son of Atreus
5870,BOOK XI.,"still shouting, and with hands all bedrabbled in gore; but when"
5871,BOOK XI.,"they had reached the Scaean gates and the oak tree, there they"
5872,BOOK XI.,halted and waited for the others to come up. Meanwhile the
5873,BOOK XI.,Trojans kept on flying over the middle of the plain like a herd
5874,BOOK XI.,of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them in the
5875,BOOK XI.,"dead of night—he springs on one of them, seizes her neck in the"
5876,BOOK XI.,grip of his strong teeth and then laps up her blood and gorges
5877,BOOK XI.,himself upon her entrails—even so did King Agamemnon son of
5878,BOOK XI.,"Atreus pursue the foe, ever slaughtering the hindmost as they"
5879,BOOK XI.,fled pell-mell before him. Many a man was flung headlong from his
5880,BOOK XI.,"chariot by the hand of the son of Atreus, for he wielded his"
5881,BOOK XI.,spear with fury.
5882,BOOK XI.,
5883,BOOK XI.,"But when he was just about to reach the high wall and the city,"
5884,BOOK XI.,the father of gods and men came down from heaven and took his
5885,BOOK XI.,"seat, thunderbolt in hand, upon the crest of many-fountained Ida."
5886,BOOK XI.,He then told Iris of the golden wings to carry a message for him.
5887,BOOK XI.,"“Go,” said he, “fleet Iris, and speak thus to Hector—say that so"
5888,BOOK XI.,long as he sees Agamemnon heading his men and making havoc of the
5889,BOOK XI.,"Trojan ranks, he is to keep aloof and bid the others bear the"
5890,BOOK XI.,"brunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon is wounded either by"
5891,BOOK XI.,"spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then will I vouchsafe"
5892,BOOK XI.,him strength to slay till he reach the ships and night falls at
5893,BOOK XI.,the going down of the sun.”
5894,BOOK XI.,
5895,BOOK XI.,Iris hearkened and obeyed. Down she went to strong Ilius from the
5896,BOOK XI.,"crests of Ida, and found Hector son of Priam standing by his"
5897,BOOK XI.,"chariot and horses. Then she said, “Hector son of Priam, peer of"
5898,BOOK XI.,"gods in counsel, father Jove has sent me to bear you this"
5899,BOOK XI.,message—so long as you see Agamemnon heading his men and making
5900,BOOK XI.,"havoc of the Trojan ranks, you are to keep aloof and bid the"
5901,BOOK XI.,"others bear the brunt of the battle, but when Agamemnon is"
5902,BOOK XI.,"wounded either by spear or arrow, and takes to his chariot, then"
5903,BOOK XI.,will Jove vouchsafe you strength to slay till you reach the
5904,BOOK XI.,"ships, and till night falls at the going down of the sun.”"
5905,BOOK XI.,
5906,BOOK XI.,"When she had thus spoken Iris left him, and Hector sprang full"
5907,BOOK XI.,"armed from his chariot to the ground, brandishing his spear as he"
5908,BOOK XI.,"went about everywhere among the host, cheering his men on to"
5909,BOOK XI.,"fight, and stirring the dread strife of battle. The Trojans then"
5910,BOOK XI.,"wheeled round, and again met the Achaeans, while the Argives on"
5911,BOOK XI.,their part strengthened their battalions. The battle was now in
5912,BOOK XI.,"array and they stood face to face with one another, Agamemnon"
5913,BOOK XI.,ever pressing forward in his eagerness to be ahead of all others.
5914,BOOK XI.,
5915,BOOK XI.,"Tell me now ye Muses that dwell in the mansions of Olympus, who,"
5916,BOOK XI.,"whether of the Trojans or of their allies, was first to face"
5917,BOOK XI.,"Agamemnon? It was Iphidamas son of Antenor, a man both brave and"
5918,BOOK XI.,"of great stature, who was brought up in fertile Thrace, the"
5919,BOOK XI.,"mother of sheep. Cisses, his mother’s father, brought him up in"
5920,BOOK XI.,"his own house when he was a child—Cisses, father to fair Theano."
5921,BOOK XI.,"When he reached manhood, Cisses would have kept him there, and"
5922,BOOK XI.,"was for giving him his daughter in marriage, but as soon as he"
5923,BOOK XI.,had married he set out to fight the Achaeans with twelve ships
5924,BOOK XI.,that followed him: these he had left at Percote and had come on
5925,BOOK XI.,by land to Ilius. He it was that now met Agamemnon son of Atreus.
5926,BOOK XI.,"When they were close up with one another, the son of Atreus"
5927,BOOK XI.,"missed his aim, and Iphidamas hit him on the girdle below the"
5928,BOOK XI.,"cuirass and then flung himself upon him, trusting to his strength"
5929,BOOK XI.,"of arm; the girdle, however, was not pierced, nor nearly so, for"
5930,BOOK XI.,the point of the spear struck against the silver and was turned
5931,BOOK XI.,aside as though it had been lead: King Agamemnon caught it from
5932,BOOK XI.,"his hand, and drew it towards him with the fury of a lion; he"
5933,BOOK XI.,"then drew his sword, and killed Iphidamas by striking him on the"
5934,BOOK XI.,"neck. So there the poor fellow lay, sleeping a sleep as it were"
5935,BOOK XI.,"of bronze, killed in the defence of his fellow-citizens, far from"
5936,BOOK XI.,"his wedded wife, of whom he had had no joy though he had given"
5937,BOOK XI.,"much for her: he had given a hundred head of cattle down, and had"
5938,BOOK XI.,"promised later on to give a thousand sheep and goats mixed, from"
5939,BOOK XI.,the countless flocks of which he was possessed. Agamemnon son of
5940,BOOK XI.,"Atreus then despoiled him, and carried off his armour into the"
5941,BOOK XI.,host of the Achaeans.
5942,BOOK XI.,
5943,BOOK XI.,"When noble Coon, Antenor’s eldest son, saw this, sore indeed were"
5944,BOOK XI.,his eyes at the sight of his fallen brother. Unseen by Agamemnon
5945,BOOK XI.,"he got beside him, spear in hand, and wounded him in the middle"
5946,BOOK XI.,"of his arm below the elbow, the point of the spear going right"
5947,BOOK XI.,"through the arm. Agamemnon was convulsed with pain, but still not"
5948,BOOK XI.,"even for this did he leave off struggling and fighting, but"
5949,BOOK XI.,"grasped his spear that flew as fleet as the wind, and sprang upon"
5950,BOOK XI.,Coon who was trying to drag off the body of his brother—his
5951,BOOK XI.,"father’s son—by the foot, and was crying for help to all the"
5952,BOOK XI.,bravest of his comrades; but Agamemnon struck him with a
5953,BOOK XI.,bronze-shod spear and killed him as he was dragging the dead body
5954,BOOK XI.,through the press of men under cover of his shield: he then cut
5955,BOOK XI.,"off his head, standing over the body of Iphidamas. Thus did the"
5956,BOOK XI.,sons of Antenor meet their fate at the hands of the son of
5957,BOOK XI.,"Atreus, and go down into the house of Hades."
5958,BOOK XI.,
5959,BOOK XI.,As long as the blood still welled warm from his wound Agamemnon
5960,BOOK XI.,went about attacking the ranks of the enemy with spear and sword
5961,BOOK XI.,"and with great handfuls of stone, but when the blood had ceased"
5962,BOOK XI.,"to flow and the wound grew dry, the pain became great. As the"
5963,BOOK XI.,"sharp pangs which the Eilithuiae, goddesses of childbirth,"
5964,BOOK XI.,"daughters of Juno and dispensers of cruel pain, send upon a woman"
5965,BOOK XI.,when she is in labour—even so sharp were the pangs of the son of
5966,BOOK XI.,"Atreus. He sprang on to his chariot, and bade his charioteer"
5967,BOOK XI.,"drive to the ships, for he was in great agony. With a loud clear"
5968,BOOK XI.,"voice he shouted to the Danaans, “My friends, princes and"
5969,BOOK XI.,"counsellors of the Argives, defend the ships yourselves, for Jove"
5970,BOOK XI.,has not suffered me to fight the whole day through against the
5971,BOOK XI.,Trojans.”
5972,BOOK XI.,
5973,BOOK XI.,"With this the charioteer turned his horses towards the ships, and"
5974,BOOK XI.,they flew forward nothing loth. Their chests were white with foam
5975,BOOK XI.,"and their bellies with dust, as they drew the wounded king out of"
5976,BOOK XI.,the battle.
5977,BOOK XI.,
5978,BOOK XI.,"When Hector saw Agamemnon quit the field, he shouted to the"
5979,BOOK XI.,"Trojans and Lycians saying, “Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanian"
5980,BOOK XI.,"warriors, be men, my friends, and acquit yourselves in battle"
5981,BOOK XI.,"bravely; their best man has left them, and Jove has vouchsafed me"
5982,BOOK XI.,a great triumph; charge the foe with your chariots that you may
5983,BOOK XI.,win still greater glory.”
5984,BOOK XI.,
5985,BOOK XI.,"With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and as a"
5986,BOOK XI.,"huntsman hounds his dogs on against a lion or wild boar, even so"
5987,BOOK XI.,"did Hector, peer of Mars, hound the proud Trojans on against the"
5988,BOOK XI.,"Achaeans. Full of hope he plunged in among the foremost, and fell"
5989,BOOK XI.,on the fight like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the
5990,BOOK XI.,"sea, and lashes its deep blue waters into fury."
5991,BOOK XI.,
5992,BOOK XI.,"What, then is the full tale of those whom Hector son of Priam"
5993,BOOK XI.,killed in the hour of triumph which Jove then vouchsafed him?
5994,BOOK XI.,"First Asaeus, Autonous, and Opites; Dolops son of Clytius,"
5995,BOOK XI.,"Opheltius and Agelaus; Aesymnus, Orus and Hipponous steadfast in"
5996,BOOK XI.,"battle; these chieftains of the Achaeans did Hector slay, and"
5997,BOOK XI.,then he fell upon the rank and file. As when the west wind
5998,BOOK XI.,hustles the clouds of the white south and beats them down with
5999,BOOK XI.,"the fierceness of its fury—the waves of the sea roll high, and"
6000,BOOK XI.,the spray is flung aloft in the rage of the wandering wind—even
6001,BOOK XI.,so thick were the heads of them that fell by the hand of Hector.
6002,BOOK XI.,
6003,BOOK XI.,"All had then been lost and no help for it, and the Achaeans would"
6004,BOOK XI.,"have fled pell-mell to their ships, had not Ulysses cried out to"
6005,BOOK XI.,"Diomed, “Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we thus"
6006,BOOK XI.,"forget our prowess? Come, my good fellow, stand by my side and"
6007,BOOK XI.,"help me, we shall be shamed for ever if Hector takes the ships.”"
6008,BOOK XI.,
6009,BOOK XI.,"And Diomed answered, “Come what may, I will stand firm; but we"
6010,BOOK XI.,"shall have scant joy of it, for Jove is minded to give victory to"
6011,BOOK XI.,the Trojans rather than to us.”
6012,BOOK XI.,
6013,BOOK XI.,With these words he struck Thymbraeus from his chariot to the
6014,BOOK XI.,"ground, smiting him in the left breast with his spear, while"
6015,BOOK XI.,"Ulysses killed Molion who was his squire. These they let lie, now"
6016,BOOK XI.,that they had stopped their fighting; the two heroes then went on
6017,BOOK XI.,"playing havoc with the foe, like two wild boars that turn in fury"
6018,BOOK XI.,and rend the hounds that hunt them. Thus did they turn upon the
6019,BOOK XI.,"Trojans and slay them, and the Achaeans were thankful to have"
6020,BOOK XI.,breathing time in their flight from Hector.
6021,BOOK XI.,
6022,BOOK XI.,"They then took two princes with their chariot, the two sons of"
6023,BOOK XI.,"Merops of Percote, who excelled all others in the arts of"
6024,BOOK XI.,"divination. He had forbidden his sons to go to the war, but they"
6025,BOOK XI.,"would not obey him, for fate lured them to their fall. Diomed son"
6026,BOOK XI.,"of Tydeus slew them both and stripped them of their armour, while"
6027,BOOK XI.,Ulysses killed Hippodamus and Hypeirochus.
6028,BOOK XI.,
6029,BOOK XI.,And now the son of Saturn as he looked down from Ida ordained
6030,BOOK XI.,"that neither side should have the advantage, and they kept on"
6031,BOOK XI.,killing one another. The son of Tydeus speared Agastrophus son of
6032,BOOK XI.,Paeon in the hip-joint with his spear. His chariot was not at
6033,BOOK XI.,"hand for him to fly with, so blindly confident had he been. His"
6034,BOOK XI.,squire was in charge of it at some distance and he was fighting
6035,BOOK XI.,on foot among the foremost until he lost his life. Hector soon
6036,BOOK XI.,"marked the havoc Diomed and Ulysses were making, and bore down"
6037,BOOK XI.,"upon them with a loud cry, followed by the Trojan ranks; brave"
6038,BOOK XI.,"Diomed was dismayed when he saw them, and said to Ulysses who was"
6039,BOOK XI.,"beside him, “Great Hector is bearing down upon us and we shall be"
6040,BOOK XI.,undone; let us stand firm and wait his onset.”
6041,BOOK XI.,
6042,BOOK XI.,"He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it, nor did he miss"
6043,BOOK XI.,his mark. He had aimed at Hector’s head near the top of his
6044,BOOK XI.,"helmet, but bronze was turned by bronze, and Hector was"
6045,BOOK XI.,"untouched, for the spear was stayed by the visored helm made with"
6046,BOOK XI.,"three plates of metal, which Phoebus Apollo had given him. Hector"
6047,BOOK XI.,sprang back with a great bound under cover of the ranks; he fell
6048,BOOK XI.,on his knees and propped himself with his brawny hand leaning on
6049,BOOK XI.,"the ground, for darkness had fallen on his eyes. The son of"
6050,BOOK XI.,Tydeus having thrown his spear dashed in among the foremost
6051,BOOK XI.,"fighters, to the place where he had seen it strike the ground;"
6052,BOOK XI.,meanwhile Hector recovered himself and springing back into his
6053,BOOK XI.,"chariot mingled with the crowd, by which means he saved his life."
6054,BOOK XI.,"But Diomed made at him with his spear and said, “Dog, you have"
6055,BOOK XI.,again got away though death was close on your heels. Phoebus
6056,BOOK XI.,"Apollo, to whom I ween you pray ere you go into battle, has again"
6057,BOOK XI.,"saved you, nevertheless I will meet you and make an end of you"
6058,BOOK XI.,"hereafter, if there is any god who will stand by me too and be my"
6059,BOOK XI.,helper. For the present I must pursue those I can lay hands on.”
6060,BOOK XI.,
6061,BOOK XI.,"As he spoke he began stripping the spoils from the son of Paeon,"
6062,BOOK XI.,"but Alexandrus husband of lovely Helen aimed an arrow at him,"
6063,BOOK XI.,leaning against a pillar of the monument which men had raised to
6064,BOOK XI.,"Ilus son of Dardanus, a ruler in days of old. Diomed had taken"
6065,BOOK XI.,"the cuirass from off the breast of Agastrophus, his heavy helmet"
6066,BOOK XI.,"also, and the shield from off his shoulders, when Paris drew his"
6067,BOOK XI.,"bow and let fly an arrow that sped not from his hand in vain, but"
6068,BOOK XI.,"pierced the flat of Diomed’s right foot, going right through it"
6069,BOOK XI.,and fixing itself in the ground. Thereon Paris with a hearty
6070,BOOK XI.,"laugh sprang forward from his hiding-place, and taunted him"
6071,BOOK XI.,"saying, “You are wounded—my arrow has not been shot in vain;"
6072,BOOK XI.,"would that it had hit you in the belly and killed you, for thus"
6073,BOOK XI.,"the Trojans, who fear you as goats fear a lion, would have had a"
6074,BOOK XI.,truce from evil.”
6075,BOOK XI.,
6076,BOOK XI.,"Diomed all undaunted answered, “Archer, you who without your bow"
6077,BOOK XI.,"are nothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in"
6078,BOOK XI.,"single combat fighting in full armour, your bow and your arrows"
6079,BOOK XI.,would serve you in little stead. Vain is your boast in that you
6080,BOOK XI.,have scratched the sole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl
6081,BOOK XI.,or some silly boy had hit me. A worthless coward can inflict but
6082,BOOK XI.,a light wound; when I wound a man though I but graze his skin it
6083,BOOK XI.,"is another matter, for my weapon will lay him low. His wife will"
6084,BOOK XI.,tear her cheeks for grief and his children will be fatherless:
6085,BOOK XI.,"there will he rot, reddening the earth with his blood, and"
6086,BOOK XI.,"vultures, not women, will gather round him.”"
6087,BOOK XI.,
6088,BOOK XI.,"Thus he spoke, but Ulysses came up and stood over him. Under this"
6089,BOOK XI.,"cover he sat down to draw the arrow from his foot, and sharp was"
6090,BOOK XI.,the pain he suffered as he did so. Then he sprang on to his
6091,BOOK XI.,"chariot and bade the charioteer drive him to the ships, for he"
6092,BOOK XI.,was sick at heart.
6093,BOOK XI.,
6094,BOOK XI.,"Ulysses was now alone; not one of the Argives stood by him, for"
6095,BOOK XI.,"they were all panic-stricken. “Alas,” said he to himself in his"
6096,BOOK XI.,"dismay, “what will become of me? It is ill if I turn and fly"
6097,BOOK XI.,"before these odds, but it will be worse if I am left alone and"
6098,BOOK XI.,"taken prisoner, for the son of Saturn has struck the rest of the"
6099,BOOK XI.,Danaans with panic. But why talk to myself in this way? Well do I
6100,BOOK XI.,"know that though cowards quit the field, a hero, whether he wound"
6101,BOOK XI.,"or be wounded, must stand firm and hold his own.”"
6102,BOOK XI.,
6103,BOOK XI.,"While he was thus in two minds, the ranks of the Trojans advanced"
6104,BOOK XI.,"and hemmed him in, and bitterly did they come to rue it. As"
6105,BOOK XI.,hounds and lusty youths set upon a wild boar that sallies from
6106,BOOK XI.,his lair whetting his white tusks—they attack him from every side
6107,BOOK XI.,"and can hear the gnashing of his jaws, but for all his fierceness"
6108,BOOK XI.,they still hold their ground—even so furiously did the Trojans
6109,BOOK XI.,attack Ulysses. First he sprang spear in hand upon Deiopites and
6110,BOOK XI.,wounded him on the shoulder with a downward blow; then he killed
6111,BOOK XI.,Thoon and Ennomus. After these he struck Chersidamas in the loins
6112,BOOK XI.,under his shield as he had just sprung down from his chariot; so
6113,BOOK XI.,he fell in the dust and clutched the earth in the hollow of his
6114,BOOK XI.,"hand. These he let lie, and went on to wound Charops son of"
6115,BOOK XI.,"Hippasus own brother to noble Socus. Socus, hero that he was,"
6116,BOOK XI.,"made all speed to help him, and when he was close to Ulysses he"
6117,BOOK XI.,"said, “Far-famed Ulysses, insatiable of craft and toil, this day"
6118,BOOK XI.,you shall either boast of having killed both the sons of Hippasus
6119,BOOK XI.,"and stripped them of their armour, or you shall fall before my"
6120,BOOK XI.,spear.”
6121,BOOK XI.,
6122,BOOK XI.,With these words he struck the shield of Ulysses. The spear went
6123,BOOK XI.,through the shield and passed on through his richly wrought
6124,BOOK XI.,"cuirass, tearing the flesh from his side, but Pallas Minerva did"
6125,BOOK XI.,not suffer it to pierce the entrails of the hero. Ulysses knew
6126,BOOK XI.,"that his hour was not yet come, but he gave ground and said to"
6127,BOOK XI.,"Socus, “Wretch, you shall now surely die. You have stayed me from"
6128,BOOK XI.,"fighting further with the Trojans, but you shall now fall by my"
6129,BOOK XI.,"spear, yielding glory to myself, and your soul to Hades of the"
6130,BOOK XI.,noble steeds.”
6131,BOOK XI.,
6132,BOOK XI.,"Socus had turned in flight, but as he did so, the spear struck"
6133,BOOK XI.,"him in the back midway between the shoulders, and went right"
6134,BOOK XI.,through his chest. He fell heavily to the ground and Ulysses
6135,BOOK XI.,"vaunted over him saying, “O Socus, son of Hippasus tamer of"
6136,BOOK XI.,"horses, death has been too quick for you and you have not escaped"
6137,BOOK XI.,"him: poor wretch, not even in death shall your father and mother"
6138,BOOK XI.,"close your eyes, but the ravening vultures shall enshroud you"
6139,BOOK XI.,with the flapping of their dark wings and devour you. Whereas
6140,BOOK XI.,even though I fall the Achaeans will give me my due rites of
6141,BOOK XI.,burial.”
6142,BOOK XI.,
6143,BOOK XI.,So saying he drew Socus’s heavy spear out of his flesh and from
6144,BOOK XI.,"his shield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was"
6145,BOOK XI.,withdrawn so that he was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that
6146,BOOK XI.,Ulysses was bleeding they raised a great shout and came on in a
6147,BOOK XI.,"body towards him; he therefore gave ground, and called his"
6148,BOOK XI.,comrades to come and help him. Thrice did he cry as loudly as man
6149,BOOK XI.,"can cry, and thrice did brave Menelaus hear him; he turned,"
6150,BOOK XI.,"therefore, to Ajax who was close beside him and said, “Ajax,"
6151,BOOK XI.,"noble son of Telamon, captain of your people, the cry of Ulysses"
6152,BOOK XI.,"rings in my ears, as though the Trojans had cut him off and were"
6153,BOOK XI.,worsting him while he is single-handed. Let us make our way
6154,BOOK XI.,through the throng; it will be well that we defend him; I fear he
6155,BOOK XI.,may come to harm for all his valour if he be left without
6156,BOOK XI.,"support, and the Danaans would miss him sorely.”"
6157,BOOK XI.,
6158,BOOK XI.,He led the way and mighty Ajax went with him. The Trojans had
6159,BOOK XI.,gathered round Ulysses like ravenous mountain jackals round the
6160,BOOK XI.,carcase of some horned stag that has been hit with an arrow—the
6161,BOOK XI.,stag has fled at full speed so long as his blood was warm and his
6162,BOOK XI.,"strength has lasted, but when the arrow has overcome him, the"
6163,BOOK XI.,savage jackals devour him in the shady glades of the forest. Then
6164,BOOK XI.,"heaven sends a fierce lion thither, whereon the jackals fly in"
6165,BOOK XI.,terror and the lion robs them of their prey—even so did Trojans
6166,BOOK XI.,"many and brave gather round crafty Ulysses, but the hero stood at"
6167,BOOK XI.,bay and kept them off with his spear. Ajax then came up with his
6168,BOOK XI.,"shield before him like a wall, and stood hard by, whereon the"
6169,BOOK XI.,Trojans fled in all directions. Menelaus took Ulysses by the
6170,BOOK XI.,"hand, and led him out of the press while his squire brought up"
6171,BOOK XI.,"his chariot, but Ajax rushed furiously on the Trojans and killed"
6172,BOOK XI.,"Doryclus, a bastard son of Priam; then he wounded Pandocus,"
6173,BOOK XI.,"Lysandrus, Pyrasus, and Pylartes; as some swollen torrent comes"
6174,BOOK XI.,"rushing in full flood from the mountains on to the plain, big"
6175,BOOK XI.,with the rain of heaven—many a dry oak and many a pine does it
6176,BOOK XI.,"engulf, and much mud does it bring down and cast into the"
6177,BOOK XI.,sea—even so did brave Ajax chase the foe furiously over the
6178,BOOK XI.,"plain, slaying both men and horses."
6179,BOOK XI.,
6180,BOOK XI.,"Hector did not yet know what Ajax was doing, for he was fighting"
6181,BOOK XI.,on the extreme left of the battle by the banks of the river
6182,BOOK XI.,"Scamander, where the carnage was thickest and the war-cry loudest"
6183,BOOK XI.,round Nestor and brave Idomeneus. Among these Hector was making
6184,BOOK XI.,"great slaughter with his spear and furious driving, and was"
6185,BOOK XI.,destroying the ranks that were opposed to him; still the Achaeans
6186,BOOK XI.,"would have given no ground, had not Alexandrus husband of lovely"
6187,BOOK XI.,"Helen stayed the prowess of Machaon, shepherd of his people, by"
6188,BOOK XI.,wounding him in the right shoulder with a triple-barbed arrow.
6189,BOOK XI.,The Achaeans were in great fear that as the fight had turned
6190,BOOK XI.,"against them the Trojans might take him prisoner, and Idomeneus"
6191,BOOK XI.,"said to Nestor, “Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the Achaean"
6192,BOOK XI.,"name, mount your chariot at once; take Machaon with you and drive"
6193,BOOK XI.,your horses to the ships as fast as you can. A physician is worth
6194,BOOK XI.,"more than several other men put together, for he can cut out"
6195,BOOK XI.,arrows and spread healing herbs.”
6196,BOOK XI.,
6197,BOOK XI.,Nestor knight of Gerene did as Idomeneus had counselled; he at
6198,BOOK XI.,"once mounted his chariot, and Machaon son of the famed physician"
6199,BOOK XI.,"Aesculapius, went with him. He lashed his horses and they flew"
6200,BOOK XI.,"onward nothing loth towards the ships, as though of their own"
6201,BOOK XI.,free will.
6202,BOOK XI.,
6203,BOOK XI.,Then Cebriones seeing the Trojans in confusion said to Hector
6204,BOOK XI.,"from his place beside him, “Hector, here are we two fighting on"
6205,BOOK XI.,"the extreme wing of the battle, while the other Trojans are in"
6206,BOOK XI.,"pell-mell rout, they and their horses. Ajax son of Telamon is"
6207,BOOK XI.,driving them before him; I know him by the breadth of his shield:
6208,BOOK XI.,"let us turn our chariot and horses thither, where horse and foot"
6209,BOOK XI.,"are fighting most desperately, and where the cry of battle is"
6210,BOOK XI.,loudest.”
6211,BOOK XI.,
6212,BOOK XI.,"With this he lashed his goodly steeds, and when they felt the"
6213,BOOK XI.,whip they drew the chariot full speed among the Achaeans and
6214,BOOK XI.,"Trojans, over the bodies and shields of those that had fallen:"
6215,BOOK XI.,"the axle was bespattered with blood, and the rail round the car"
6216,BOOK XI.,was covered with splashes both from the horses’ hoofs and from
6217,BOOK XI.,the tyres of the wheels. Hector tore his way through and flung
6218,BOOK XI.,"himself into the thick of the fight, and his presence threw the"
6219,BOOK XI.,"Danaans into confusion, for his spear was not long idle;"
6220,BOOK XI.,"nevertheless though he went among the ranks with sword and spear,"
6221,BOOK XI.,"and throwing great stones, he avoided Ajax son of Telamon, for"
6222,BOOK XI.,Jove would have been angry with him if he had fought a better man
6223,BOOK XI.,than himself.
6224,BOOK XI.,
6225,BOOK XI.,Then father Jove from his high throne struck fear into the heart
6226,BOOK XI.,"of Ajax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield behind"
6227,BOOK XI.,him—looking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were
6228,BOOK XI.,"some wild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching"
6229,BOOK XI.,slowly backwards. As peasants with their hounds chase a lion from
6230,BOOK XI.,"their stockyard, and watch by night to prevent his carrying off"
6231,BOOK XI.,"the pick of their herd—he makes his greedy spring, but in vain,"
6232,BOOK XI.,"for the darts from many a strong hand fall thick around him, with"
6233,BOOK XI.,"burning brands that scare him for all his fury, and when morning"
6234,BOOK XI.,"comes he slinks foiled and angry away—even so did Ajax, sorely"
6235,BOOK XI.,"against his will, retreat angrily before the Trojans, fearing for"
6236,BOOK XI.,the ships of the Achaeans. Or as some lazy ass that has had many
6237,BOOK XI.,"a cudgel broken about his back, when he into a field begins"
6238,BOOK XI.,"eating the corn—boys beat him but he is too many for them, and"
6239,BOOK XI.,though they lay about with their sticks they cannot hurt him;
6240,BOOK XI.,still when he has had his fill they at last drive him from the
6241,BOOK XI.,"field—even so did the Trojans and their allies pursue great Ajax,"
6242,BOOK XI.,ever smiting the middle of his shield with their darts. Now and
6243,BOOK XI.,"again he would turn and show fight, keeping back the battalions"
6244,BOOK XI.,"of the Trojans, and then he would again retreat; but he prevented"
6245,BOOK XI.,any of them from making his way to the ships. Single-handed he
6246,BOOK XI.,stood midway between the Trojans and Achaeans: the spears that
6247,BOOK XI.,"sped from their hands stuck some of them in his mighty shield,"
6248,BOOK XI.,"while many, though thirsting for his blood, fell to the ground"
6249,BOOK XI.,ere they could reach him to the wounding of his fair flesh.
6250,BOOK XI.,
6251,BOOK XI.,Now when Eurypylus the brave son of Euaemon saw that Ajax was
6252,BOOK XI.,"being overpowered by the rain of arrows, he went up to him and"
6253,BOOK XI.,hurled his spear. He struck Apisaon son of Phausius in the liver
6254,BOOK XI.,"below the midriff, and laid him low. Eurypylus sprang upon him,"
6255,BOOK XI.,and stripped the armour from his shoulders; but when Alexandrus
6256,BOOK XI.,"saw him, he aimed an arrow at him which struck him in the right"
6257,BOOK XI.,"thigh; the arrow broke, but the point that was left in the wound"
6258,BOOK XI.,"dragged on the thigh; he drew back, therefore, under cover of his"
6259,BOOK XI.,"comrades to save his life, shouting as he did so to the Danaans,"
6260,BOOK XI.,"“My friends, princes and counsellors of the Argives, rally to the"
6261,BOOK XI.,"defence of Ajax who is being overpowered, and I doubt whether he"
6262,BOOK XI.,"will come out of the fight alive. Hither, then, to the rescue of"
6263,BOOK XI.,great Ajax son of Telamon.”
6264,BOOK XI.,
6265,BOOK XI.,Even so did he cry when he was wounded; thereon the others came
6266,BOOK XI.,"near, and gathered round him, holding their shields upwards from"
6267,BOOK XI.,their shoulders so as to give him cover. Ajax then made towards
6268,BOOK XI.,"them, and turned round to stand at bay as soon as he had reached"
6269,BOOK XI.,his men.
6270,BOOK XI.,
6271,BOOK XI.,Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the
6272,BOOK XI.,"mares of Neleus, all in a lather with sweat, were bearing Nestor"
6273,BOOK XI.,"out of the fight, and with him Machaon shepherd of his people."
6274,BOOK XI.,"Achilles saw and took note, for he was standing on the stern of"
6275,BOOK XI.,his ship watching the hard stress and struggle of the fight. He
6276,BOOK XI.,"called from the ship to his comrade Patroclus, who heard him in"
6277,BOOK XI.,the tent and came out looking like Mars himself—here indeed was
6278,BOOK XI.,"the beginning of the ill that presently befell him. “Why,” said"
6279,BOOK XI.,"he, “Achilles, do you call me? What do you want with me?” And"
6280,BOOK XI.,"Achilles answered, “Noble son of Menoetius, man after my own"
6281,BOOK XI.,"heart, I take it that I shall now have the Achaeans praying at my"
6282,BOOK XI.,"knees, for they are in great straits; go, Patroclus, and ask"
6283,BOOK XI.,Nestor who it is that he is bearing away wounded from the field;
6284,BOOK XI.,"from his back I should say it was Machaon son of Aesculapius, but"
6285,BOOK XI.,I could not see his face for the horses went by me at full
6286,BOOK XI.,speed.”
6287,BOOK XI.,
6288,BOOK XI.,"Patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him, and set off"
6289,BOOK XI.,running by the ships and tents of the Achaeans.
6290,BOOK XI.,
6291,BOOK XI.,When Nestor and Machaon had reached the tents of the son of
6292,BOOK XI.,"Neleus, they dismounted, and an esquire, Eurymedon, took the"
6293,BOOK XI.,horses from the chariot. The pair then stood in the breeze by the
6294,BOOK XI.,"seaside to dry the sweat from their shirts, and when they had so"
6295,BOOK XI.,"done they came inside and took their seats. Fair Hecamede, whom"
6296,BOOK XI.,"Nestor had had awarded to him from Tenedos when Achilles took it,"
6297,BOOK XI.,"mixed them a mess; she was daughter of wise Arsinous, and the"
6298,BOOK XI.,Achaeans had given her to Nestor because he excelled all of them
6299,BOOK XI.,in counsel. First she set for them a fair and well-made table
6300,BOOK XI.,that had feet of cyanus; on it there was a vessel of bronze and
6301,BOOK XI.,"an onion to give relish to the drink, with honey and cakes of"
6302,BOOK XI.,barley-meal. There was also a cup of rare workmanship which the
6303,BOOK XI.,"old man had brought with him from home, studded with bosses of"
6304,BOOK XI.,"gold; it had four handles, on each of which there were two golden"
6305,BOOK XI.,"doves feeding, and it had two feet to stand on. Any one else"
6306,BOOK XI.,would hardly have been able to lift it from the table when it was
6307,BOOK XI.,"full, but Nestor could do so quite easily. In this the woman, as"
6308,BOOK XI.,"fair as a goddess, mixed them a mess with Pramnian wine; she"
6309,BOOK XI.,"grated goat’s milk cheese into it with a bronze grater, threw in"
6310,BOOK XI.,"a handful of white barley-meal, and having thus prepared the mess"
6311,BOOK XI.,she bade them drink it. When they had done so and had thus
6312,BOOK XI.,"quenched their thirst, they fell talking with one another, and at"
6313,BOOK XI.,this moment Patroclus appeared at the door.
6314,BOOK XI.,
6315,BOOK XI.,"When the old man saw him he sprang from his seat, seized his"
6316,BOOK XI.,"hand, led him into the tent, and bade him take his place among"
6317,BOOK XI.,"them; but Patroclus stood where he was and said, “Noble sir, I"
6318,BOOK XI.,"may not stay, you cannot persuade me to come in; he that sent me"
6319,BOOK XI.,"is not one to be trifled with, and he bade me ask who the wounded"
6320,BOOK XI.,man was whom you were bearing away from the field. I can now see
6321,BOOK XI.,"for myself that he is Machaon, shepherd of his people. I must go"
6322,BOOK XI.,"back and tell Achilles. You, sir, know what a terrible man he is,"
6323,BOOK XI.,and how ready to blame even where no blame should lie.”
6324,BOOK XI.,
6325,BOOK XI.,"And Nestor answered, “Why should Achilles care to know how many"
6326,BOOK XI.,of the Achaeans may be wounded? He recks not of the dismay that
6327,BOOK XI.,"reigns in our host; our most valiant chieftains lie disabled,"
6328,BOOK XI.,"brave Diomed, son of Tydeus, is wounded; so are Ulysses and"
6329,BOOK XI.,"Agamemnon; Eurypylus has been hit with an arrow in the thigh, and"
6330,BOOK XI.,I have just been bringing this man from the field—he too wounded
6331,BOOK XI.,"with an arrow. Nevertheless, Achilles, so valiant though he be,"
6332,BOOK XI.,"cares not and knows no ruth. Will he wait till the ships, do what"
6333,BOOK XI.,"we may, are in a blaze, and we perish one upon the other? As for"
6334,BOOK XI.,"me, I have no strength nor stay in me any longer; would that I"
6335,BOOK XI.,were still young and strong as in the days when there was a fight
6336,BOOK XI.,between us and the men of Elis about some cattle-raiding. I then
6337,BOOK XI.,"killed Itymoneus, the valiant son of Hypeirochus, a dweller in"
6338,BOOK XI.,"Elis, as I was driving in the spoil; he was hit by a dart thrown"
6339,BOOK XI.,by my hand while fighting in the front rank in defence of his
6340,BOOK XI.,"cows, so he fell and the country people around him were in great"
6341,BOOK XI.,"fear. We drove off a vast quantity of booty from the plain, fifty"
6342,BOOK XI.,herds of cattle and as many flocks of sheep; fifty droves also of
6343,BOOK XI.,"pigs, and as many wide-spreading flocks of goats. Of horses,"
6344,BOOK XI.,"moreover, we seized a hundred and fifty, all of them mares, and"
6345,BOOK XI.,many had foals running with them. All these did we drive by night
6346,BOOK XI.,"to Pylus, the city of Neleus, taking them within the city; and"
6347,BOOK XI.,"the heart of Neleus was glad in that I had taken so much, though"
6348,BOOK XI.,it was the first time I had ever been in the field. At daybreak
6349,BOOK XI.,the heralds went round crying that all in Elis to whom there was
6350,BOOK XI.,a debt owing should come; and the leading Pylians assembled to
6351,BOOK XI.,divide the spoils. There were many to whom the Epeans owed
6352,BOOK XI.,"chattels, for we men of Pylus were few and had been oppressed"
6353,BOOK XI.,"with wrong; in former years Hercules had come, and had laid his"
6354,BOOK XI.,"hand heavy upon us, so that all our best men had perished. Neleus"
6355,BOOK XI.,"had had twelve sons, but I alone was left; the others had all"
6356,BOOK XI.,been killed. The Epeans presuming upon all this had looked down
6357,BOOK XI.,upon us and had done us much evil. My father chose a herd of
6358,BOOK XI.,cattle and a great flock of sheep—three hundred in all—and he
6359,BOOK XI.,"took their shepherds with him, for there was a great debt due to"
6360,BOOK XI.,"him in Elis, to wit four horses, winners of prizes. They and"
6361,BOOK XI.,their chariots with them had gone to the games and were to run
6362,BOOK XI.,"for a tripod, but King Augeas took them, and sent back their"
6363,BOOK XI.,driver grieving for the loss of his horses. Neleus was angered by
6364,BOOK XI.,"what he had both said and done, and took great value in return,"
6365,BOOK XI.,"but he divided the rest, that no man might have less than his"
6366,BOOK XI.,full share.
6367,BOOK XI.,
6368,BOOK XI.,"“Thus did we order all things, and offer sacrifices to the gods"
6369,BOOK XI.,throughout the city; but three days afterwards the Epeans came in
6370,BOOK XI.,"a body, many in number, they and their chariots, in full array,"
6371,BOOK XI.,"and with them the two Moliones in their armour, though they were"
6372,BOOK XI.,"still lads and unused to fighting. Now there is a certain town,"
6373,BOOK XI.,"Thryoessa, perched upon a rock on the river Alpheus, the border"
6374,BOOK XI.,"city of Pylus. This they would destroy, and pitched their camp"
6375,BOOK XI.,"about it, but when they had crossed their whole plain, Minerva"
6376,BOOK XI.,darted down by night from Olympus and bade us set ourselves in
6377,BOOK XI.,"array; and she found willing soldiers in Pylos, for the men meant"
6378,BOOK XI.,"fighting. Neleus would not let me arm, and hid my horses, for he"
6379,BOOK XI.,said that as yet I could know nothing about war; nevertheless
6380,BOOK XI.,"Minerva so ordered the fight that, all on foot as I was, I fought"
6381,BOOK XI.,among our mounted forces and vied with the foremost of them.
6382,BOOK XI.,"There is a river Minyeius that falls into the sea near Arene, and"
6383,BOOK XI.,there they that were mounted (and I with them) waited till
6384,BOOK XI.,"morning, when the companies of foot soldiers came up with us in"
6385,BOOK XI.,force. Thence in full panoply and equipment we came towards noon
6386,BOOK XI.,"to the sacred waters of the Alpheus, and there we offered victims"
6387,BOOK XI.,"to almighty Jove, with a bull to Alpheus, another to Neptune, and"
6388,BOOK XI.,a herd-heifer to Minerva. After this we took supper in our
6389,BOOK XI.,"companies, and laid us down to rest each in his armour by the"
6390,BOOK XI.,river.
6391,BOOK XI.,
6392,BOOK XI.,“The Epeans were beleaguering the city and were determined to
6393,BOOK XI.,"take it, but ere this might be there was a desperate fight in"
6394,BOOK XI.,store for them. When the sun’s rays began to fall upon the earth
6395,BOOK XI.,"we joined battle, praying to Jove and to Minerva, and when the"
6396,BOOK XI.,"fight had begun, I was the first to kill my man and take his"
6397,BOOK XI.,"horses—to wit the warrior Mulius. He was son-in-law to Augeas,"
6398,BOOK XI.,"having married his eldest daughter, golden-haired Agamede, who"
6399,BOOK XI.,knew the virtues of every herb which grows upon the face of the
6400,BOOK XI.,"earth. I speared him as he was coming towards me, and when he"
6401,BOOK XI.,"fell headlong in the dust, I sprang upon his chariot and took my"
6402,BOOK XI.,place in the front ranks. The Epeans fled in all directions when
6403,BOOK XI.,they saw the captain of their horsemen (the best man they had)
6404,BOOK XI.,"laid low, and I swept down on them like a whirlwind, taking fifty"
6405,BOOK XI.,"chariots—and in each of them two men bit the dust, slain by my"
6406,BOOK XI.,"spear. I should have even killed the two Moliones, sons of Actor,"
6407,BOOK XI.,"unless their real father, Neptune lord of the earthquake, had"
6408,BOOK XI.,hidden them in a thick mist and borne them out of the fight.
6409,BOOK XI.,"Thereon Jove vouchsafed the Pylians a great victory, for we"
6410,BOOK XI.,"chased them far over the plain, killing the men and bringing in"
6411,BOOK XI.,"their armour, till we had brought our horses to Buprasium, rich"
6412,BOOK XI.,"in wheat, and to the Olenian rock, with the hill that is called"
6413,BOOK XI.,"Alision, at which point Minerva turned the people back. There I"
6414,BOOK XI.,slew the last man and left him; then the Achaeans drove their
6415,BOOK XI.,horses back from Buprasium to Pylos and gave thanks to Jove among
6416,BOOK XI.,"the gods, and among mortal men to Nestor."
6417,BOOK XI.,
6418,BOOK XI.,"“Such was I among my peers, as surely as ever was, but Achilles"
6419,BOOK XI.,is for keeping all his valour for himself; bitterly will he rue
6420,BOOK XI.,it hereafter when the host is being cut to pieces. My good
6421,BOOK XI.,"friend, did not Menoetius charge you thus, on the day when he"
6422,BOOK XI.,sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon? Ulysses and I were in the
6423,BOOK XI.,"house, inside, and heard all that he said to you; for we came to"
6424,BOOK XI.,the fair house of Peleus while beating up recruits throughout all
6425,BOOK XI.,"Achaea, and when we got there we found Menoetius and yourself,"
6426,BOOK XI.,and Achilles with you. The old knight Peleus was in the outer
6427,BOOK XI.,"court, roasting the fat thigh-bones of a heifer to Jove the lord"
6428,BOOK XI.,of thunder; and he held a gold chalice in his hand from which he
6429,BOOK XI.,poured drink-offerings of wine over the burning sacrifice. You
6430,BOOK XI.,"two were busy cutting up the heifer, and at that moment we stood"
6431,BOOK XI.,"at the gates, whereon Achilles sprang to his feet, led us by the"
6432,BOOK XI.,"hand into the house, placed us at table, and set before us such"
6433,BOOK XI.,hospitable entertainment as guests expect. When we had satisfied
6434,BOOK XI.,"ourselves with meat and drink, I said my say and urged both of"
6435,BOOK XI.,"you to join us. You were ready enough to do so, and the two old"
6436,BOOK XI.,men charged you much and straitly. Old Peleus bade his son
6437,BOOK XI.,"Achilles fight ever among the foremost and outvie his peers,"
6438,BOOK XI.,"while Menoetius the son of Actor spoke thus to you: ‘My son,’"
6439,BOOK XI.,"said he, ‘Achilles is of nobler birth than you are, but you are"
6440,BOOK XI.,"older than he, though he is far the better man of the two."
6441,BOOK XI.,"Counsel him wisely, guide him in the right way, and he will"
6442,BOOK XI.,"follow you to his own profit.’ Thus did your father charge you,"
6443,BOOK XI.,"but you have forgotten; nevertheless, even now, say all this to"
6444,BOOK XI.,Achilles if he will listen to you. Who knows but with heaven’s
6445,BOOK XI.,"help you may talk him over, for it is good to take a friend’s"
6446,BOOK XI.,"advice. If, however, he is fearful about some oracle, or if his"
6447,BOOK XI.,"mother has told him something from Jove, then let him send you,"
6448,BOOK XI.,"and let the rest of the Myrmidons follow with you, if perchance"
6449,BOOK XI.,you may bring light and saving to the Danaans. And let him send
6450,BOOK XI.,"you into battle clad in his own armour, that the Trojans may"
6451,BOOK XI.,mistake you for him and leave off fighting; the sons of the
6452,BOOK XI.,"Achaeans may thus have time to get their breath, for they are"
6453,BOOK XI.,"hard pressed and there is little breathing time in battle. You,"
6454,BOOK XI.,"who are fresh, might easily drive a tired enemy back to his walls"
6455,BOOK XI.,and away from the tents and ships.”
6456,BOOK XI.,
6457,BOOK XI.,"With these words he moved the heart of Patroclus, who set off"
6458,BOOK XI.,"running by the line of the ships to Achilles, descendant of"
6459,BOOK XI.,"Aeacus. When he had got as far as the ships of Ulysses, where was"
6460,BOOK XI.,"their place of assembly and court of justice, with their altars"
6461,BOOK XI.,"dedicated to the gods, Eurypylus son of Euaemon, met him, wounded"
6462,BOOK XI.,"in the thigh with an arrow, and limping out of the fight. Sweat"
6463,BOOK XI.,"rained from his head and shoulders, and black blood welled from"
6464,BOOK XI.,"his cruel wound, but his mind did not wander. The son of"
6465,BOOK XI.,Menoetius when he saw him had compassion upon him and spoke
6466,BOOK XI.,"piteously saying, “O unhappy princes and counsellors of the"
6467,BOOK XI.,"Danaans, are you then doomed to feed the hounds of Troy with your"
6468,BOOK XI.,"fat, far from your friends and your native land? Say, noble"
6469,BOOK XI.,"Eurypylus, will the Achaeans be able to hold great Hector in"
6470,BOOK XI.,"check, or will they fall now before his spear?”"
6471,BOOK XI.,
6472,BOOK XI.,"Wounded Eurypylus made answer, “Noble Patroclus, there is no hope"
6473,BOOK XI.,left for the Achaeans but they will perish at their ships. All
6474,BOOK XI.,they that were princes among us are lying struck down and wounded
6475,BOOK XI.,"at the hands of the Trojans, who are waxing stronger and"
6476,BOOK XI.,stronger. But save me and take me to your ship; cut out the arrow
6477,BOOK XI.,"from my thigh; wash the black blood from off it with warm water,"
6478,BOOK XI.,"and lay upon it those gracious herbs which, so they say, have"
6479,BOOK XI.,"been shown you by Achilles, who was himself shown them by Chiron,"
6480,BOOK XI.,most righteous of all the centaurs. For of the physicians
6481,BOOK XI.,"Podalirius and Machaon, I hear that the one is lying wounded in"
6482,BOOK XI.,"his tent and is himself in need of healing, while the other is"
6483,BOOK XI.,fighting the Trojans upon the plain.”
6484,BOOK XI.,
6485,BOOK XI.,"“Hero Eurypylus,” replied the brave son of Menoetius, “how may"
6486,BOOK XI.,these things be? What can I do? I am on my way to bear a message
6487,BOOK XI.,"to noble Achilles from Nestor of Gerene, bulwark of the Achaeans,"
6488,BOOK XI.,but even so I will not be unmindful of your distress.”
6489,BOOK XI.,
6490,BOOK XI.,With this he clasped him round the middle and led him into the
6491,BOOK XI.,"tent, and a servant, when he saw him, spread bullock-skins on the"
6492,BOOK XI.,ground for him to lie on. He laid him at full length and cut out
6493,BOOK XI.,the sharp arrow from his thigh; he washed the black blood from
6494,BOOK XI.,"the wound with warm water; he then crushed a bitter herb, rubbing"
6495,BOOK XI.,"it between his hands, and spread it upon the wound; this was a"
6496,BOOK XI.,virtuous herb which killed all pain; so the wound presently dried
6497,BOOK XI.,and the blood left off flowing.

6504,BOOK XII.,
6505,BOOK XII.,"The Trojans and their allies break the wall, led on by Hector."
6506,BOOK XII.,
6507,BOOK XII.,So the son of Menoetius was attending to the hurt of Eurypylus
6508,BOOK XII.,"within the tent, but the Argives and Trojans still fought"
6509,BOOK XII.,"desperately, nor were the trench and the high wall above it, to"
6510,BOOK XII.,keep the Trojans in check longer. They had built it to protect
6511,BOOK XII.,"their ships, and had dug the trench all round it that it might"
6512,BOOK XII.,safeguard both the ships and the rich spoils which they had
6513,BOOK XII.,"taken, but they had not offered hecatombs to the gods. It had"
6514,BOOK XII.,"been built without the consent of the immortals, and therefore it"
6515,BOOK XII.,did not last. So long as Hector lived and Achilles nursed his
6516,BOOK XII.,"anger, and so long as the city of Priam remained untaken, the"
6517,BOOK XII.,great wall of the Achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of
6518,BOOK XII.,"the Trojans were no more, and many also of the Argives, though"
6519,BOOK XII.,"some were yet left alive—when, moreover, the city was sacked in"
6520,BOOK XII.,"the tenth year, and the Argives had gone back with their ships to"
6521,BOOK XII.,their own country—then Neptune and Apollo took counsel to destroy
6522,BOOK XII.,"the wall, and they turned on to it the streams of all the rivers"
6523,BOOK XII.,"from Mount Ida into the sea, Rhesus, Heptaporus, Caresus,"
6524,BOOK XII.,"Rhodius, Grenicus, Aesopus, and goodly Scamander, with Simois,"
6525,BOOK XII.,"where many a shield and helm had fallen, and many a hero of the"
6526,BOOK XII.,race of demigods had bitten the dust. Phoebus Apollo turned the
6527,BOOK XII.,mouths of all these rivers together and made them flow for nine
6528,BOOK XII.,"days against the wall, while Jove rained the whole time that he"
6529,BOOK XII.,"might wash it sooner into the sea. Neptune himself, trident in"
6530,BOOK XII.,"hand, surveyed the work and threw into the sea all the"
6531,BOOK XII.,foundations of beams and stones which the Achaeans had laid with
6532,BOOK XII.,so much toil; he made all level by the mighty stream of the
6533,BOOK XII.,"Hellespont, and then when he had swept the wall away he spread a"
6534,BOOK XII.,great beach of sand over the place where it had been. This done
6535,BOOK XII.,he turned the rivers back into their old courses.
6536,BOOK XII.,
6537,BOOK XII.,This was what Neptune and Apollo were to do in after time; but as
6538,BOOK XII.,yet battle and turmoil were still raging round the wall till its
6539,BOOK XII.,"timbers rang under the blows that rained upon them. The Argives,"
6540,BOOK XII.,"cowed by the scourge of Jove, were hemmed in at their ships in"
6541,BOOK XII.,"fear of Hector the mighty minister of Rout, who as heretofore"
6542,BOOK XII.,fought with the force and fury of a whirlwind. As a lion or wild
6543,BOOK XII.,"boar turns fiercely on the dogs and men that attack him, while"
6544,BOOK XII.,these form a solid wall and shower their javelins as they face
6545,BOOK XII.,"him—his courage is all undaunted, but his high spirit will be the"
6546,BOOK XII.,death of him; many a time does he charge at his pursuers to
6547,BOOK XII.,"scatter them, and they fall back as often as he does so—even so"
6548,BOOK XII.,"did Hector go about among the host exhorting his men, and"
6549,BOOK XII.,cheering them on to cross the trench.
6550,BOOK XII.,
6551,BOOK XII.,"But the horses dared not do so, and stood neighing upon its"
6552,BOOK XII.,"brink, for the width frightened them. They could neither jump it"
6553,BOOK XII.,"nor cross it, for it had overhanging banks all round upon either"
6554,BOOK XII.,"side, above which there were the sharp stakes that the sons of"
6555,BOOK XII.,the Achaeans had planted so close and strong as a defence against
6556,BOOK XII.,"all who would assail it; a horse, therefore, could not get into"
6557,BOOK XII.,"it and draw his chariot after him, but those who were on foot"
6558,BOOK XII.,kept trying their very utmost. Then Polydamas went up to Hector
6559,BOOK XII.,"and said, “Hector, and you other captains of the Trojans and"
6560,BOOK XII.,"allies, it is madness for us to try and drive our horses across"
6561,BOOK XII.,"the trench; it will be very hard to cross, for it is full of"
6562,BOOK XII.,"sharp stakes, and beyond these there is the wall. Our horses"
6563,BOOK XII.,"therefore cannot get down into it, and would be of no use if they"
6564,BOOK XII.,did; moreover it is a narrow place and we should come to harm.
6565,BOOK XII.,"If, indeed, great Jove is minded to help the Trojans, and in his"
6566,BOOK XII.,"anger will utterly destroy the Achaeans, I would myself gladly"
6567,BOOK XII.,see them perish now and here far from Argos; but if they should
6568,BOOK XII.,rally and we are driven back from the ships pell-mell into the
6569,BOOK XII.,trench there will be not so much as a man get back to the city to
6570,BOOK XII.,"tell the tale. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let our"
6571,BOOK XII.,"squires hold our horses by the trench, but let us follow Hector"
6572,BOOK XII.,"in a body on foot, clad in full armour, and if the day of their"
6573,BOOK XII.,doom is at hand the Achaeans will not be able to withstand us.”
6574,BOOK XII.,
6575,BOOK XII.,"Thus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased Hector, who sprang in"
6576,BOOK XII.,"full armour to the ground, and all the other Trojans, when they"
6577,BOOK XII.,"saw him do so, also left their chariots. Each man then gave his"
6578,BOOK XII.,horses over to his charioteer in charge to hold them ready for
6579,BOOK XII.,"him at the trench. Then they formed themselves into companies,"
6580,BOOK XII.,"made themselves ready, and in five bodies followed their leaders."
6581,BOOK XII.,Those that went with Hector and Polydamas were the bravest and
6582,BOOK XII.,"most in number, and the most determined to break through the wall"
6583,BOOK XII.,and fight at the ships. Cebriones was also joined with them as
6584,BOOK XII.,"third in command, for Hector had left his chariot in charge of a"
6585,BOOK XII.,"less valiant soldier. The next company was led by Paris,"
6586,BOOK XII.,"Alcathous, and Agenor; the third by Helenus and Deiphobus, two"
6587,BOOK XII.,"sons of Priam, and with them was the hero Asius—Asius, the son of"
6588,BOOK XII.,"Hyrtacus, whose great black horses of the breed that comes from"
6589,BOOK XII.,"the river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe. Aeneas, the"
6590,BOOK XII.,"valiant son of Anchises, led the fourth; he and the two sons of"
6591,BOOK XII.,"Antenor, Archelochus and Acamas, men well versed in all the arts"
6592,BOOK XII.,"of war. Sarpedon was captain over the allies, and took with him"
6593,BOOK XII.,Glaucus and Asteropaeus whom he deemed most valiant after
6594,BOOK XII.,himself—for he was far the best man of them all. These helped to
6595,BOOK XII.,"array one another in their ox-hide shields, and then charged"
6596,BOOK XII.,"straight at the Danaans, for they felt sure that they would not"
6597,BOOK XII.,hold out longer and that they should themselves now fall upon the
6598,BOOK XII.,ships.
6599,BOOK XII.,
6600,BOOK XII.,The rest of the Trojans and their allies now followed the counsel
6601,BOOK XII.,"of Polydamas but Asius, son of Hyrtacus, would not leave his"
6602,BOOK XII.,horses and his esquire behind him; in his foolhardiness he took
6603,BOOK XII.,"them on with him towards the ships, nor did he fail to come by"
6604,BOOK XII.,his end in consequence. Nevermore was he to return to wind-beaten
6605,BOOK XII.,"Ilius, exulting in his chariot and his horses; ere he could do"
6606,BOOK XII.,"so, death of ill-omened name had overshadowed him and he had"
6607,BOOK XII.,fallen by the spear of Idomeneus the noble son of Deucalion. He
6608,BOOK XII.,"had driven towards the left wing of the ships, by which way the"
6609,BOOK XII.,Achaeans used to return with their chariots and horses from the
6610,BOOK XII.,plain. Hither he drove and found the gates with their doors
6611,BOOK XII.,"opened wide, and the great bar down—for the gatemen kept them"
6612,BOOK XII.,open so as to let those of their comrades enter who might be
6613,BOOK XII.,flying towards the ships. Hither of set purpose did he direct his
6614,BOOK XII.,"horses, and his men followed him with a loud cry, for they felt"
6615,BOOK XII.,"sure that the Achaeans would not hold out longer, and that they"
6616,BOOK XII.,should now fall upon the ships. Little did they know that at the
6617,BOOK XII.,"gates they should find two of the bravest chieftains, proud sons"
6618,BOOK XII.,"of the fighting Lapithae—the one, Polypoetes, mighty son of"
6619,BOOK XII.,"Pirithous, and the other Leonteus, peer of murderous Mars. These"
6620,BOOK XII.,stood before the gates like two high oak trees upon the
6621,BOOK XII.,"mountains, that tower from their wide-spreading roots, and year"
6622,BOOK XII.,after year battle with wind and rain—even so did these two men
6623,BOOK XII.,await the onset of great Asius confidently and without flinching.
6624,BOOK XII.,"The Trojans led by him and by Iamenus, Orestes, Adamas the son of"
6625,BOOK XII.,"Asius, Thoon and Oenomaus, raised a loud cry of battle and made"
6626,BOOK XII.,"straight for the wall, holding their shields of dry ox-hide above"
6627,BOOK XII.,their heads; for a while the two defenders remained inside and
6628,BOOK XII.,cheered the Achaeans on to stand firm in the defence of their
6629,BOOK XII.,"ships; when, however, they saw that the Trojans were attacking"
6630,BOOK XII.,"the wall, while the Danaans were crying out for help and being"
6631,BOOK XII.,"routed, they rushed outside and fought in front of the gates like"
6632,BOOK XII.,two wild boars upon the mountains that abide the attack of men
6633,BOOK XII.,"and dogs, and charging on either side break down the wood all"
6634,BOOK XII.,"round them tearing it up by the roots, and one can hear the"
6635,BOOK XII.,"clattering of their tusks, till some one hits them and makes an"
6636,BOOK XII.,end of them—even so did the gleaming bronze rattle about their
6637,BOOK XII.,"breasts, as the weapons fell upon them; for they fought with"
6638,BOOK XII.,"great fury, trusting to their own prowess and to those who were"
6639,BOOK XII.,on the wall above them. These threw great stones at their
6640,BOOK XII.,assailants in defence of themselves their tents and their ships.
6641,BOOK XII.,The stones fell thick as the flakes of snow which some fierce
6642,BOOK XII.,blast drives from the dark clouds and showers down in sheets upon
6643,BOOK XII.,the earth—even so fell the weapons from the hands alike of
6644,BOOK XII.,Trojans and Achaeans. Helmet and shield rang out as the great
6645,BOOK XII.,"stones rained upon them, and Asius, the son of Hyrtacus, in his"
6646,BOOK XII.,"dismay cried aloud and smote his two thighs. “Father Jove,” he"
6647,BOOK XII.,"cried, “of a truth you too are altogether given to lying. I made"
6648,BOOK XII.,"sure the Argive heroes could not withstand us, whereas like"
6649,BOOK XII.,"slim-waisted wasps, or bees that have their nests in the rocks by"
6650,BOOK XII.,the wayside—they leave not the holes wherein they have built
6651,BOOK XII.,"undefended, but fight for their little ones against all who would"
6652,BOOK XII.,"take them—even so these men, though they be but two, will not be"
6653,BOOK XII.,"driven from the gates, but stand firm either to slay or be"
6654,BOOK XII.,slain.”
6655,BOOK XII.,
6656,BOOK XII.,"He spoke, but moved not the mind of Jove, whose counsel it then"
6657,BOOK XII.,was to give glory to Hector. Meanwhile the rest of the Trojans
6658,BOOK XII.,"were fighting about the other gates; I, however, am no god to be"
6659,BOOK XII.,"able to tell about all these things, for the battle raged"
6660,BOOK XII.,everywhere about the stone wall as it were a fiery furnace. The
6661,BOOK XII.,"Argives, discomfited though they were, were forced to defend"
6662,BOOK XII.,"their ships, and all the gods who were defending the Achaeans"
6663,BOOK XII.,were vexed in spirit; but the Lapithae kept on fighting with
6664,BOOK XII.,might and main.
6665,BOOK XII.,
6666,BOOK XII.,"Thereon Polypoetes, mighty son of Pirithous, hit Damasus with a"
6667,BOOK XII.,spear upon his cheek-pierced helmet. The helmet did not protect
6668,BOOK XII.,"him, for the point of the spear went through it, and broke the"
6669,BOOK XII.,"bone, so that the brain inside was scattered about, and he died"
6670,BOOK XII.,"fighting. He then slew Pylon and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the race"
6671,BOOK XII.,"of Mars, killed Hippomachus the son of Antimachus by striking him"
6672,BOOK XII.,with his spear upon the girdle. He then drew his sword and sprang
6673,BOOK XII.,"first upon Antiphates whom he killed in combat, and who fell face"
6674,BOOK XII.,"upwards on the earth. After him he killed Menon, Iamenus, and"
6675,BOOK XII.,"Orestes, and laid them low one after the other."
6676,BOOK XII.,
6677,BOOK XII.,"While they were busy stripping the armour from these heroes, the"
6678,BOOK XII.,youths who were led on by Polydamas and Hector (and these were
6679,BOOK XII.,the greater part and the most valiant of those that were trying
6680,BOOK XII.,to break through the wall and fire the ships) were still standing
6681,BOOK XII.,"by the trench, uncertain what they should do; for they had seen a"
6682,BOOK XII.,sign from heaven when they had essayed to cross it—a soaring
6683,BOOK XII.,"eagle that flew skirting the left wing of their host, with a"
6684,BOOK XII.,monstrous blood-red snake in its talons still alive and
6685,BOOK XII.,"struggling to escape. The snake was still bent on revenge,"
6686,BOOK XII.,wriggling and twisting itself backwards till it struck the bird
6687,BOOK XII.,"that held it, on the neck and breast; whereon the bird being in"
6688,BOOK XII.,"pain, let it fall, dropping it into the middle of the host, and"
6689,BOOK XII.,then flew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans were struck
6690,BOOK XII.,"with terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearing"
6691,BOOK XII.,"Jove, writhing in the midst of them, and Polydamas went up to"
6692,BOOK XII.,"Hector and said, “Hector, at our councils of war you are ever"
6693,BOOK XII.,"given to rebuke me, even when I speak wisely, as though it were"
6694,BOOK XII.,"not well, forsooth, that one of the people should cross your will"
6695,BOOK XII.,either in the field or at the council board; you would have them
6696,BOOK XII.,support you always: nevertheless I will say what I think will be
6697,BOOK XII.,"best; let us not now go on to fight the Danaans at their ships,"
6698,BOOK XII.,for I know what will happen if this soaring eagle which skirted
6699,BOOK XII.,the left wing of our host with a monstrous blood-red snake in its
6700,BOOK XII.,talons (the snake being still alive) was really sent as an omen
6701,BOOK XII.,to the Trojans on their essaying to cross the trench. The eagle
6702,BOOK XII.,let go her hold; she did not succeed in taking it home to her
6703,BOOK XII.,"little ones, and so will it be—with ourselves; even though by a"
6704,BOOK XII.,mighty effort we break through the gates and wall of the
6705,BOOK XII.,"Achaeans, and they give way before us, still we shall not return"
6706,BOOK XII.,"in good order by the way we came, but shall leave many a man"
6707,BOOK XII.,behind us whom the Achaeans will do to death in defence of their
6708,BOOK XII.,"ships. Thus would any seer who was expert in these matters, and"
6709,BOOK XII.,"was trusted by the people, read the portent.”"
6710,BOOK XII.,
6711,BOOK XII.,"Hector looked fiercely at him and said, “Polydamas, I like not of"
6712,BOOK XII.,your reading. You can find a better saying than this if you will.
6713,BOOK XII.,"If, however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has"
6714,BOOK XII.,heaven robbed you of your reason. You would have me pay no heed
6715,BOOK XII.,"to the counsels of Jove, nor to the promises he made me—and he"
6716,BOOK XII.,bowed his head in confirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the
6717,BOOK XII.,flight of wild-fowl. What care I whether they fly towards dawn or
6718,BOOK XII.,"dark, and whether they be on my right hand or on my left? Let us"
6719,BOOK XII.,"put our trust rather in the counsel of great Jove, king of"
6720,BOOK XII.,"mortals and immortals. There is one omen, and one only—that a man"
6721,BOOK XII.,should fight for his country. Why are you so fearful? Though we
6722,BOOK XII.,be all of us slain at the ships of the Argives you are not likely
6723,BOOK XII.,"to be killed yourself, for you are not steadfast nor courageous."
6724,BOOK XII.,"If you will not fight, or would talk others over from doing so,"
6725,BOOK XII.,you shall fall forthwith before my spear.”
6726,BOOK XII.,
6727,BOOK XII.,"With these words he led the way, and the others followed after"
6728,BOOK XII.,with a cry that rent the air. Then Jove the lord of thunder sent
6729,BOOK XII.,"the blast of a mighty wind from the mountains of Ida, that bore"
6730,BOOK XII.,the dust down towards the ships; he thus lulled the Achaeans into
6731,BOOK XII.,"security, and gave victory to Hector and to the Trojans, who,"
6732,BOOK XII.,"trusting to their own might and to the signs he had shown them,"
6733,BOOK XII.,essayed to break through the great wall of the Achaeans. They
6734,BOOK XII.,"tore down the breastworks from the walls, and overthrew the"
6735,BOOK XII.,"battlements; they upheaved the buttresses, which the Achaeans had"
6736,BOOK XII.,set in front of the wall in order to support it; when they had
6737,BOOK XII.,"pulled these down they made sure of breaking through the wall,"
6738,BOOK XII.,but the Danaans still showed no sign of giving ground; they still
6739,BOOK XII.,"fenced the battlements with their shields of ox-hide, and hurled"
6740,BOOK XII.,their missiles down upon the foe as soon as any came below the
6741,BOOK XII.,wall.
6742,BOOK XII.,
6743,BOOK XII.,The two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the walls cheering on the
6744,BOOK XII.,"Achaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke sharply to"
6745,BOOK XII.,"any one whom they saw to be remiss. “My friends,” they cried,"
6746,BOOK XII.,"“Argives one and all—good bad and indifferent, for there was"
6747,BOOK XII.,"never fight yet, in which all were of equal prowess—there is now"
6748,BOOK XII.,"work enough, as you very well know, for all of you. See that you"
6749,BOOK XII.,"none of you turn in flight towards the ships, daunted by the"
6750,BOOK XII.,"shouting of the foe, but press forward and keep one another in"
6751,BOOK XII.,"heart, if it may so be that Olympian Jove the lord of lightning"
6752,BOOK XII.,"will vouchsafe us to repel our foes, and drive them back towards"
6753,BOOK XII.,the city.”
6754,BOOK XII.,
6755,BOOK XII.,Thus did the two go about shouting and cheering the Achaeans on.
6756,BOOK XII.,"As the flakes that fall thick upon a winter’s day, when Jove is"
6757,BOOK XII.,minded to snow and to display these his arrows to mankind—he
6758,BOOK XII.,"lulls the wind to rest, and snows hour after hour till he has"
6759,BOOK XII.,"buried the tops of the high mountains, the headlands that jut"
6760,BOOK XII.,"into the sea, the grassy plains, and the tilled fields of men;"
6761,BOOK XII.,"the snow lies deep upon the forelands, and havens of the grey"
6762,BOOK XII.,"sea, but the waves as they come rolling in stay it that it can"
6763,BOOK XII.,"come no further, though all else is wrapped as with a mantle, so"
6764,BOOK XII.,heavy are the heavens with snow—even thus thickly did the stones
6765,BOOK XII.,"fall on one side and on the other, some thrown at the Trojans,"
6766,BOOK XII.,and some by the Trojans at the Achaeans; and the whole wall was
6767,BOOK XII.,in an uproar.
6768,BOOK XII.,
6769,BOOK XII.,Still the Trojans and brave Hector would not yet have broken down
6770,BOOK XII.,"the gates and the great bar, had not Jove turned his son Sarpedon"
6771,BOOK XII.,against the Argives as a lion against a herd of horned cattle.
6772,BOOK XII.,"Before him he held his shield of hammered bronze, that the smith"
6773,BOOK XII.,"had beaten so fair and round, and had lined with ox-hides which"
6774,BOOK XII.,he had made fast with rivets of gold all round the shield; this
6775,BOOK XII.,"he held in front of him, and brandishing his two spears came on"
6776,BOOK XII.,"like some lion of the wilderness, who has been long famished for"
6777,BOOK XII.,want of meat and will dare break even into a well-fenced
6778,BOOK XII.,homestead to try and get at the sheep. He may find the shepherds
6779,BOOK XII.,"keeping watch over their flocks with dogs and spears, but he is"
6780,BOOK XII.,in no mind to be driven from the fold till he has had a try for
6781,BOOK XII.,"it; he will either spring on a sheep and carry it off, or be hit"
6782,BOOK XII.,by a spear from some strong hand—even so was Sarpedon fain to
6783,BOOK XII.,attack the wall and break down its battlements. Then he said to
6784,BOOK XII.,"Glaucus son of Hippolochus, “Glaucus, why in Lycia do we receive"
6785,BOOK XII.,especial honour as regards our place at table? Why are the
6786,BOOK XII.,"choicest portions served us and our cups kept brimming, and why"
6787,BOOK XII.,do men look up to us as though we were gods? Moreover we hold a
6788,BOOK XII.,"large estate by the banks of the river Xanthus, fair with orchard"
6789,BOOK XII.,"lawns and wheat-growing land; it becomes us, therefore, to take"
6790,BOOK XII.,our stand at the head of all the Lycians and bear the brunt of
6791,BOOK XII.,"the fight, that one may say to another, ‘Our princes in Lycia eat"
6792,BOOK XII.,"the fat of the land and drink best of wine, but they are fine"
6793,BOOK XII.,fellows; they fight well and are ever at the front in battle.’ My
6794,BOOK XII.,"good friend, if, when we were once out of this fight, we could"
6795,BOOK XII.,"escape old age and death thenceforward and forever, I should"
6796,BOOK XII.,"neither press forward myself nor bid you do so, but death in ten"
6797,BOOK XII.,"thousand shapes hangs ever over our heads, and no man can elude"
6798,BOOK XII.,him; therefore let us go forward and either win glory for
6799,BOOK XII.,"ourselves, or yield it to another.”"
6800,BOOK XII.,
6801,BOOK XII.,"Glaucus heeded his saying, and the pair forthwith led on the host"
6802,BOOK XII.,of Lycians. Menestheus son of Peteos was dismayed when he saw
6803,BOOK XII.,"them, for it was against his part of the wall that they"
6804,BOOK XII.,came—bringing destruction with them; he looked along the wall for
6805,BOOK XII.,"some chieftain to support his comrades and saw the two Ajaxes,"
6806,BOOK XII.,"men ever eager for the fray, and Teucer, who had just come from"
6807,BOOK XII.,"his tent, standing near them; but he could not make his voice"
6808,BOOK XII.,"heard by shouting to them, so great an uproar was there from"
6809,BOOK XII.,crashing shields and helmets and the battering of gates with a
6810,BOOK XII.,"din which reached the skies. For all the gates had been closed,"
6811,BOOK XII.,and the Trojans were hammering at them to try and break their way
6812,BOOK XII.,"through them. Menestheus, therefore, sent Thootes with a message"
6813,BOOK XII.,"to Ajax. “Run, good Thootes,” he said, “and call Ajax, or better"
6814,BOOK XII.,"still bid both come, for it will be all over with us here"
6815,BOOK XII.,"directly; the leaders of the Lycians are upon us, men who have"
6816,BOOK XII.,ever fought desperately heretofore. But if they have too much on
6817,BOOK XII.,"their hands to let them come, at any rate let Ajax son of Telamon"
6818,BOOK XII.,"do so, and let Teucer, the famous bowman, come with him.”"
6819,BOOK XII.,
6820,BOOK XII.,"The messenger did as he was told, and set off running along the"
6821,BOOK XII.,"wall of the Achaeans. When he reached the Ajaxes he said to them,"
6822,BOOK XII.,"“Sirs, princes of the Argives, the son of noble Peteos bids you"
6823,BOOK XII.,come to him for a while and help him. You had better both come if
6824,BOOK XII.,"you can, or it will be all over with him directly; the leaders of"
6825,BOOK XII.,"the Lycians are upon him, men who have ever fought desperately"
6826,BOOK XII.,"heretofore; if you have too much on your hands to let both come,"
6827,BOOK XII.,"at any rate let Ajax, son of Telamon, do so, and let Teucer, the"
6828,BOOK XII.,"famous bowman, come with him.”"
6829,BOOK XII.,
6830,BOOK XII.,"Great Ajax son of Telamon heeded the message, and at once spoke"
6831,BOOK XII.,"to the son of Oileus. “Ajax,” said he, “do you two, yourself and"
6832,BOOK XII.,"brave Lycomedes, stay here and keep the Danaans in heart to fight"
6833,BOOK XII.,"their hardest. I will go over yonder, and bear my part in the"
6834,BOOK XII.,"fray, but I will come back here at once as soon as I have given"
6835,BOOK XII.,them the help they need.”
6836,BOOK XII.,
6837,BOOK XII.,"With this, Ajax son of Telamon set off, and Teucer, his brother"
6838,BOOK XII.,"by the same father, went also, with Pandion to carry Teucer’s"
6839,BOOK XII.,"bow. They went along inside the wall, and when they came to the"
6840,BOOK XII.,tower where Menestheus was (and hard pressed indeed did they find
6841,BOOK XII.,him) the brave captains and leaders of the Lycians were storming
6842,BOOK XII.,"the battlements as it were a thick dark cloud, fighting in close"
6843,BOOK XII.,"quarters, and raising the battle-cry aloud."
6844,BOOK XII.,
6845,BOOK XII.,"First, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave Epicles, a comrade of"
6846,BOOK XII.,"Sarpedon, hitting him with a jagged stone that lay by the"
6847,BOOK XII.,"battlements at the very top of the wall. As men now are, even one"
6848,BOOK XII.,who is in the bloom of youth could hardly lift it with his two
6849,BOOK XII.,"hands, but Ajax raised it high aloft and flung it down, smashing"
6850,BOOK XII.,Epicles’ four-crested helmet so that the bones of his head were
6851,BOOK XII.,"crushed to pieces, and he fell from the high wall as though he"
6852,BOOK XII.,"were diving, with no more life left in him. Then Teucer wounded"
6853,BOOK XII.,Glaucus the brave son of Hippolochus as he was coming on to
6854,BOOK XII.,attack the wall. He saw his shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at
6855,BOOK XII.,"it, which made Glaucus leave off fighting. Thereon he sprang"
6856,BOOK XII.,covertly down for fear some of the Achaeans might see that he was
6857,BOOK XII.,wounded and taunt him. Sarpedon was stung with grief when he saw
6858,BOOK XII.,"Glaucus leave him, still he did not leave off fighting, but aimed"
6859,BOOK XII.,his spear at Alcmaon the son of Thestor and hit him. He drew his
6860,BOOK XII.,spear back again and Alcmaon came down headlong after it with his
6861,BOOK XII.,bronzed armour rattling round him. Then Sarpedon seized the
6862,BOOK XII.,"battlement in his strong hands, and tugged at it till it all gave"
6863,BOOK XII.,"way together, and a breach was made through which many might"
6864,BOOK XII.,pass.
6865,BOOK XII.,
6866,BOOK XII.,Ajax and Teucer then both of them attacked him. Teucer hit him
6867,BOOK XII.,with an arrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his
6868,BOOK XII.,"body, but Jove saved his son from destruction that he might not"
6869,BOOK XII.,fall by the ships’ sterns. Meanwhile Ajax sprang on him and
6870,BOOK XII.,"pierced his shield, but the spear did not go clean through,"
6871,BOOK XII.,though it hustled him back that he could come on no further. He
6872,BOOK XII.,"therefore retired a little space from the battlement, yet without"
6873,BOOK XII.,"losing all his ground, for he still thought to cover himself with"
6874,BOOK XII.,glory. Then he turned round and shouted to the brave Lycians
6875,BOOK XII.,"saying, “Lycians, why do you thus fail me? For all my prowess I"
6876,BOOK XII.,cannot break through the wall and open a way to the ships
6877,BOOK XII.,"single-handed. Come close on behind me, for the more there are of"
6878,BOOK XII.,us the better.”
6879,BOOK XII.,
6880,BOOK XII.,"The Lycians, shamed by his rebuke, pressed closer round him who"
6881,BOOK XII.,was their counsellor and their king. The Argives on their part
6882,BOOK XII.,"got their men in fighting order within the wall, and there was a"
6883,BOOK XII.,deadly struggle between them. The Lycians could not break through
6884,BOOK XII.,"the wall and force their way to the ships, nor could the Danaans"
6885,BOOK XII.,drive the Lycians from the wall now that they had once reached
6886,BOOK XII.,"it. As two men, measuring-rods in hand, quarrel about their"
6887,BOOK XII.,"boundaries in a field that they own in common, and stickle for"
6888,BOOK XII.,"their rights though they be but in a mere strip, even so did the"
6889,BOOK XII.,"battlements now serve as a bone of contention, and they beat one"
6890,BOOK XII.,another’s round shields for their possession. Many a man’s body
6891,BOOK XII.,"was wounded with the pitiless bronze, as he turned round and"
6892,BOOK XII.,"bared his back to the foe, and many were struck clean through"
6893,BOOK XII.,their shields; the wall and battlements were everywhere deluged
6894,BOOK XII.,with the blood alike of Trojans and of Achaeans. But even so the
6895,BOOK XII.,"Trojans could not rout the Achaeans, who still held on; and as"
6896,BOOK XII.,some honest hard-working woman weighs wool in her balance and
6897,BOOK XII.,"sees that the scales be true, for she would gain some pitiful"
6898,BOOK XII.,"earnings for her little ones, even so was the fight balanced"
6899,BOOK XII.,evenly between them till the time came when Jove gave the greater
6900,BOOK XII.,"glory to Hector son of Priam, who was first to spring towards the"
6901,BOOK XII.,"wall of the Achaeans. When he had done so, he cried aloud to the"
6902,BOOK XII.,"Trojans, “Up, Trojans, break the wall of the Argives, and fling"
6903,BOOK XII.,fire upon their ships.”
6904,BOOK XII.,
6905,BOOK XII.,"Thus did he hound them on, and in one body they rushed straight"
6906,BOOK XII.,"at the wall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements"
6907,BOOK XII.,with sharp spears in their hands. Hector laid hold of a stone
6908,BOOK XII.,that lay just outside the gates and was thick at one end but
6909,BOOK XII.,"pointed at the other; two of the best men in a town, as men now"
6910,BOOK XII.,"are, could hardly raise it from the ground and put it on to a"
6911,BOOK XII.,"waggon, but Hector lifted it quite easily by himself, for the son"
6912,BOOK XII.,of scheming Saturn made it light for him. As a shepherd picks up
6913,BOOK XII.,"a ram’s fleece with one hand and finds it no burden, so easily"
6914,BOOK XII.,did Hector lift the great stone and drive it right at the doors
6915,BOOK XII.,that closed the gates so strong and so firmly set. These doors
6916,BOOK XII.,"were double and high, and were kept closed by two cross-bars to"
6917,BOOK XII.,"which there was but one key. When he had got close up to them,"
6918,BOOK XII.,Hector strode towards them that his blow might gain in force and
6919,BOOK XII.,"struck them in the middle, leaning his whole weight against them."
6920,BOOK XII.,"He broke both hinges, and the stone fell inside by reason of its"
6921,BOOK XII.,"great weight. The portals re-echoed with the sound, the bars held"
6922,BOOK XII.,"no longer, and the doors flew open, one one way, and the other"
6923,BOOK XII.,"the other, through the force of the blow. Then brave Hector"
6924,BOOK XII.,leaped inside with a face as dark as that of flying night. The
6925,BOOK XII.,gleaming bronze flashed fiercely about his body and he had two
6926,BOOK XII.,spears in his hand. None but a god could have withstood him as he
6927,BOOK XII.,"flung himself into the gateway, and his eyes glared like fire."
6928,BOOK XII.,Then he turned round towards the Trojans and called on them to
6929,BOOK XII.,"scale the wall, and they did as he bade them—some of them at once"
6930,BOOK XII.,"climbing over the wall, while others passed through the gates."
6931,BOOK XII.,"The Danaans then fled panic-stricken towards their ships, and all"
6932,BOOK XII.,was uproar and confusion.
6933,BOOK XII.,
6934,BOOK XII.,
6935,BOOK XII.,
6936,BOOK XII.,
6937,BOOK XIII.,BOOK XIII.
6938,BOOK XIII.,
6939,BOOK XIII.,
6940,BOOK XIII.,Neptune helps the Achaeans—The feats of Idomeneus—Hector at the
6941,BOOK XIII.,ships.
6942,BOOK XIII.,
6943,BOOK XIII.,Now when Jove had thus brought Hector and the Trojans to the
6944,BOOK XIII.,"ships, he left them to their never-ending toil, and turned his"
6945,BOOK XIII.,"keen eyes away, looking elsewhither towards the horse-breeders of"
6946,BOOK XIII.,"Thrace, the Mysians, fighters at close quarters, the noble"
6947,BOOK XIII.,"Hippemolgi, who live on milk, and the Abians, justest of mankind."
6948,BOOK XIII.,"He no longer turned so much as a glance towards Troy, for he did"
6949,BOOK XIII.,not think that any of the immortals would go and help either
6950,BOOK XIII.,Trojans or Danaans.
6951,BOOK XIII.,
6952,BOOK XIII.,But King Neptune had kept no blind look-out; he had been looking
6953,BOOK XIII.,admiringly on the battle from his seat on the topmost crests of
6954,BOOK XIII.,"wooded Samothrace, whence he could see all Ida, with the city of"
6955,BOOK XIII.,Priam and the ships of the Achaeans. He had come from under the
6956,BOOK XIII.,"sea and taken his place here, for he pitied the Achaeans who were"
6957,BOOK XIII.,being overcome by the Trojans; and he was furiously angry with
6958,BOOK XIII.,Jove.
6959,BOOK XIII.,
6960,BOOK XIII.,"Presently he came down from his post on the mountain top, and as"
6961,BOOK XIII.,he strode swiftly onwards the high hills and the forest quaked
6962,BOOK XIII.,"beneath the tread of his immortal feet. Three strides he took,"
6963,BOOK XIII.,"and with the fourth he reached his goal—Aegae, where is his"
6964,BOOK XIII.,"glittering golden palace, imperishable, in the depths of the sea."
6965,BOOK XIII.,"When he got there, he yoked his fleet brazen-footed steeds with"
6966,BOOK XIII.,their manes of gold all flying in the wind; he clothed himself in
6967,BOOK XIII.,"raiment of gold, grasped his gold whip, and took his stand upon"
6968,BOOK XIII.,his chariot. As he went his way over the waves the sea-monsters
6969,BOOK XIII.,"left their lairs, for they knew their lord, and came gambolling"
6970,BOOK XIII.,"round him from every quarter of the deep, while the sea in her"
6971,BOOK XIII.,gladness opened a path before his chariot. So lightly did the
6972,BOOK XIII.,horses fly that the bronze axle of the car was not even wet
6973,BOOK XIII.,beneath it; and thus his bounding steeds took him to the ships of
6974,BOOK XIII.,the Achaeans.
6975,BOOK XIII.,
6976,BOOK XIII.,Now there is a certain huge cavern in the depths of the sea
6977,BOOK XIII.,midway between Tenedos and rocky Imbrus; here Neptune lord of the
6978,BOOK XIII.,"earthquake stayed his horses, unyoked them, and set before them"
6979,BOOK XIII.,their ambrosial forage. He hobbled their feet with hobbles of
6980,BOOK XIII.,"gold which none could either unloose or break, so that they might"
6981,BOOK XIII.,stay there in that place until their lord should return. This
6982,BOOK XIII.,done he went his way to the host of the Achaeans.
6983,BOOK XIII.,
6984,BOOK XIII.,Now the Trojans followed Hector son of Priam in close array like
6985,BOOK XIII.,"a storm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main and"
6986,BOOK XIII.,raising the cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the
6987,BOOK XIII.,ships of the Achaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and
6988,BOOK XIII.,there. Meanwhile earth-encircling Neptune lord of the earthquake
6989,BOOK XIII.,"cheered on the Argives, for he had come up out of the sea and had"
6990,BOOK XIII.,assumed the form and voice of Calchas.
6991,BOOK XIII.,
6992,BOOK XIII.,"First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing their best"
6993,BOOK XIII.,"already, and said, “Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the"
6994,BOOK XIII.,Achaeans if you will put out all your strength and not let
6995,BOOK XIII.,"yourselves be daunted. I am not afraid that the Trojans, who have"
6996,BOOK XIII.,"got over the wall in force, will be victorious in any other part,"
6997,BOOK XIII.,"for the Achaeans can hold all of them in check, but I much fear"
6998,BOOK XIII.,"that some evil will befall us here where furious Hector, who"
6999,BOOK XIII.,"boasts himself the son of great Jove himself, is leading them on"
7000,BOOK XIII.,"like a pillar of flame. May some god, then, put it into your"
7001,BOOK XIII.,"hearts to make a firm stand here, and to incite others to do the"
7002,BOOK XIII.,like. In this case you will drive him from the ships even though
7003,BOOK XIII.,he be inspired by Jove himself.”
7004,BOOK XIII.,
7005,BOOK XIII.,As he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the earthquake struck
7006,BOOK XIII.,both of them with his sceptre and filled their hearts with
7007,BOOK XIII.,"daring. He made their legs light and active, as also their hands"
7008,BOOK XIII.,"and their feet. Then, as the soaring falcon poises on the wing"
7009,BOOK XIII.,"high above some sheer rock, and presently swoops down to chase"
7010,BOOK XIII.,"some bird over the plain, even so did Neptune lord of the"
7011,BOOK XIII.,earthquake wing his flight into the air and leave them. Of the
7012,BOOK XIII.,"two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was the first to know who it was"
7013,BOOK XIII.,"that had been speaking with them, and said to Ajax son of"
7014,BOOK XIII.,"Telamon, “Ajax, this is one of the gods that dwell on Olympus,"
7015,BOOK XIII.,who in the likeness of the prophet is bidding us fight hard by
7016,BOOK XIII.,our ships. It was not Calchas the seer and diviner of omens; I
7017,BOOK XIII.,"knew him at once by his feet and knees as he turned away, for the"
7018,BOOK XIII.,gods are soon recognised. Moreover I feel the lust of battle burn
7019,BOOK XIII.,"more fiercely within me, while my hands and my feet under me are"
7020,BOOK XIII.,more eager for the fray.”
7021,BOOK XIII.,
7022,BOOK XIII.,"And Ajax son of Telamon answered, “I too feel my hands grasp my"
7023,BOOK XIII.,"spear more firmly; my strength is greater, and my feet more"
7024,BOOK XIII.,"nimble; I long, moreover, to meet furious Hector son of Priam,"
7025,BOOK XIII.,even in single combat.”
7026,BOOK XIII.,
7027,BOOK XIII.,"Thus did they converse, exulting in the hunger after battle with"
7028,BOOK XIII.,which the god had filled them. Meanwhile the earth-encircler
7029,BOOK XIII.,"roused the Achaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships"
7030,BOOK XIII.,overcome at once by hard fighting and by grief at seeing that the
7031,BOOK XIII.,Trojans had got over the wall in force. Tears began falling from
7032,BOOK XIII.,"their eyes as they beheld them, for they made sure that they"
7033,BOOK XIII.,should not escape destruction; but the lord of the earthquake
7034,BOOK XIII.,passed lightly about among them and urged their battalions to the
7035,BOOK XIII.,front.
7036,BOOK XIII.,
7037,BOOK XIII.,"First he went up to Teucer and Leitus, the hero Peneleos, and"
7038,BOOK XIII.,"Thoas and Deipyrus; Meriones also and Antilochus, valiant"
7039,BOOK XIII.,"warriors; all did he exhort. “Shame on you young Argives,” he"
7040,BOOK XIII.,"cried, “it was on your prowess I relied for the saving of our"
7041,BOOK XIII.,"ships; if you fight not with might and main, this very day will"
7042,BOOK XIII.,see us overcome by the Trojans. Of a truth my eyes behold a great
7043,BOOK XIII.,and terrible portent which I had never thought to see—the Trojans
7044,BOOK XIII.,"at our ships—they, who were heretofore like panic-stricken hinds,"
7045,BOOK XIII.,"the prey of jackals and wolves in a forest, with no strength but"
7046,BOOK XIII.,in flight for they cannot defend themselves. Hitherto the Trojans
7047,BOOK XIII.,"dared not for one moment face the attack of the Achaeans, but now"
7048,BOOK XIII.,they have sallied far from their city and are fighting at our
7049,BOOK XIII.,very ships through the cowardice of our leader and the
7050,BOOK XIII.,"disaffection of the people themselves, who in their discontent"
7051,BOOK XIII.,care not to fight in defence of the ships but are being
7052,BOOK XIII.,"slaughtered near them. True, King Agamemnon son of Atreus is the"
7053,BOOK XIII.,"cause of our disaster by having insulted the son of Peleus, still"
7054,BOOK XIII.,this is no reason why we should leave off fighting. Let us be
7055,BOOK XIII.,"quick to heal, for the hearts of the brave heal quickly. You do"
7056,BOOK XIII.,"ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the finest soldiers in our"
7057,BOOK XIII.,whole army. I blame no man for keeping out of battle if he is a
7058,BOOK XIII.,"weakling, but I am indignant with such men as you are. My good"
7059,BOOK XIII.,"friends, matters will soon become even worse through this"
7060,BOOK XIII.,"slackness; think, each one of you, of his own honour and credit,"
7061,BOOK XIII.,for the hazard of the fight is extreme. Great Hector is now
7062,BOOK XIII.,fighting at our ships; he has broken through the gates and the
7063,BOOK XIII.,strong bolt that held them.”
7064,BOOK XIII.,
7065,BOOK XIII.,Thus did the earth-encircler address the Achaeans and urge them
7066,BOOK XIII.,on. Thereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong bands of
7067,BOOK XIII.,"men, of whom not even Mars nor Minerva, marshaller of hosts could"
7068,BOOK XIII.,"make light if they went among them, for they were the picked men"
7069,BOOK XIII.,of all those who were now awaiting the onset of Hector and the
7070,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans. They made a living fence, spear to spear, shield to"
7071,BOOK XIII.,"shield, buckler to buckler, helmet to helmet, and man to man. The"
7072,BOOK XIII.,horse-hair crests on their gleaming helmets touched one another
7073,BOOK XIII.,"as they nodded forward, so closely serried were they; the spears"
7074,BOOK XIII.,"they brandished in their strong hands were interlaced, and their"
7075,BOOK XIII.,hearts were set on battle.
7076,BOOK XIII.,
7077,BOOK XIII.,"The Trojans advanced in a dense body, with Hector at their head"
7078,BOOK XIII.,pressing right on as a rock that comes thundering down the side
7079,BOOK XIII.,of some mountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn
7080,BOOK XIII.,it; the foundations of the dull thing have been loosened by
7081,BOOK XIII.,"floods of rain, and as it bounds headlong on its way it sets the"
7082,BOOK XIII.,whole forest in an uproar; it swerves neither to right nor left
7083,BOOK XIII.,"till it reaches level ground, but then for all its fury it can go"
7084,BOOK XIII.,no further—even so easily did Hector for a while seem as though
7085,BOOK XIII.,he would career through the tents and ships of the Achaeans till
7086,BOOK XIII.,he had reached the sea in his murderous course; but the closely
7087,BOOK XIII.,"serried battalions stayed him when he reached them, for the sons"
7088,BOOK XIII.,of the Achaeans thrust at him with swords and spears pointed at
7089,BOOK XIII.,"both ends, and drove him from them so that he staggered and gave"
7090,BOOK XIII.,"ground; thereon he shouted to the Trojans, “Trojans, Lycians, and"
7091,BOOK XIII.,"Dardanians, fighters in close combat, stand firm: the Achaeans"
7092,BOOK XIII.,"have set themselves as a wall against me, but they will not check"
7093,BOOK XIII.,me for long; they will give ground before me if the mightiest of
7094,BOOK XIII.,"the gods, the thundering spouse of Juno, has indeed inspired my"
7095,BOOK XIII.,onset.”
7096,BOOK XIII.,
7097,BOOK XIII.,With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Deiphobus
7098,BOOK XIII.,son of Priam went about among them intent on deeds of daring with
7099,BOOK XIII.,"his round shield before him, under cover of which he strode"
7100,BOOK XIII.,"quickly forward. Meriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did"
7101,BOOK XIII.,he fail to hit the broad orb of ox-hide; but he was far from
7102,BOOK XIII.,piercing it for the spear broke in two pieces long ere he could
7103,BOOK XIII.,do so; moreover Deiphobus had seen it coming and had held his
7104,BOOK XIII.,shield well away from him. Meriones drew back under cover of his
7105,BOOK XIII.,"comrades, angry alike at having failed to vanquish Deiphobus, and"
7106,BOOK XIII.,having broken his spear. He turned therefore towards the ships
7107,BOOK XIII.,and tents to fetch a spear which he had left behind in his tent.
7108,BOOK XIII.,
7109,BOOK XIII.,"The others continued fighting, and the cry of battle rose up into"
7110,BOOK XIII.,"the heavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill his man,"
7111,BOOK XIII.,"to wit, the warrior Imbrius, son of Mentor, rich in horses. Until"
7112,BOOK XIII.,"the Achaeans came he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married"
7113,BOOK XIII.,"Medesicaste, a bastard daughter of Priam; but on the arrival of"
7114,BOOK XIII.,"the Danaan fleet he had gone back to Ilius, and was a great man"
7115,BOOK XIII.,"among the Trojans, dwelling near Priam himself, who gave him like"
7116,BOOK XIII.,honour with his own sons. The son of Telamon now struck him under
7117,BOOK XIII.,"the ear with a spear which he then drew back again, and Imbrius"
7118,BOOK XIII.,fell headlong as an ash-tree when it is felled on the crest of
7119,BOOK XIII.,"some high mountain beacon, and its delicate green foliage comes"
7120,BOOK XIII.,toppling down to the ground. Thus did he fall with his
7121,BOOK XIII.,"bronze-dight armour ringing harshly round him, and Teucer sprang"
7122,BOOK XIII.,forward with intent to strip him of his armour; but as he was
7123,BOOK XIII.,"doing so, Hector took aim at him with a spear. Teucer saw the"
7124,BOOK XIII.,"spear coming and swerved aside, whereon it hit Amphimachus, son"
7125,BOOK XIII.,"of Cteatus son of Actor, in the chest as he was coming into"
7126,BOOK XIII.,"battle, and his armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily"
7127,BOOK XIII.,to the ground. Hector sprang forward to take Amphimachus’s helmet
7128,BOOK XIII.,"from off his temples, and in a moment Ajax threw a spear at him,"
7129,BOOK XIII.,"but did not wound him, for he was encased all over in his"
7130,BOOK XIII.,terrible armour; nevertheless the spear struck the boss of his
7131,BOOK XIII.,"shield with such force as to drive him back from the two corpses,"
7132,BOOK XIII.,"which the Achaeans then drew off. Stichius and Menestheus,"
7133,BOOK XIII.,"captains of the Athenians, bore away Amphimachus to the host of"
7134,BOOK XIII.,"the Achaeans, while the two brave and impetuous Ajaxes did the"
7135,BOOK XIII.,like by Imbrius. As two lions snatch a goat from the hounds that
7136,BOOK XIII.,"have it in their fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high"
7137,BOOK XIII.,"above the ground in their jaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear aloft"
7138,BOOK XIII.,"the body of Imbrius, and strip it of its armour. Then the son of"
7139,BOOK XIII.,Oileus severed the head from the neck in revenge for the death of
7140,BOOK XIII.,"Amphimachus, and sent it whirling over the crowd as though it had"
7141,BOOK XIII.,"been a ball, till it fell in the dust at Hector’s feet."
7142,BOOK XIII.,
7143,BOOK XIII.,Neptune was exceedingly angry that his grandson Amphimachus
7144,BOOK XIII.,should have fallen; he therefore went to the tents and ships of
7145,BOOK XIII.,"the Achaeans to urge the Danaans still further, and to devise"
7146,BOOK XIII.,"evil for the Trojans. Idomeneus met him, as he was taking leave"
7147,BOOK XIII.,"of a comrade, who had just come to him from the fight, wounded in"
7148,BOOK XIII.,"the knee. His fellow-soldiers bore him off the field, and"
7149,BOOK XIII.,Idomeneus having given orders to the physicians went on to his
7150,BOOK XIII.,"tent, for he was still thirsting for battle. Neptune spoke in the"
7151,BOOK XIII.,likeness and with the voice of Thoas son of Andraemon who ruled
7152,BOOK XIII.,"the Aetolians of all Pleuron and high Calydon, and was honoured"
7153,BOOK XIII.,"among his people as though he were a god. “Idomeneus,” said he,"
7154,BOOK XIII.,"“lawgiver to the Cretans, what has now become of the threats with"
7155,BOOK XIII.,which the sons of the Achaeans used to threaten the Trojans?”
7156,BOOK XIII.,
7157,BOOK XIII.,"And Idomeneus chief among the Cretans answered, “Thoas, no one,"
7158,BOOK XIII.,"so far as I know, is in fault, for we can all fight. None are"
7159,BOOK XIII.,"held back neither by fear nor slackness, but it seems to be the"
7160,BOOK XIII.,will of almighty Jove that the Achaeans should perish
7161,BOOK XIII.,"ingloriously here far from Argos: you, Thoas, have been always"
7162,BOOK XIII.,"staunch, and you keep others in heart if you see any fail in"
7163,BOOK XIII.,"duty; be not then remiss now, but exhort all to do their utmost.”"
7164,BOOK XIII.,
7165,BOOK XIII.,"To this Neptune lord of the earthquake made answer, “Idomeneus,"
7166,BOOK XIII.,"may he never return from Troy, but remain here for dogs to batten"
7167,BOOK XIII.,"upon, who is this day wilfully slack in fighting. Get your armour"
7168,BOOK XIII.,"and go, we must make all haste together if we may be of any use,"
7169,BOOK XIII.,though we are only two. Even cowards gain courage from
7170,BOOK XIII.,"companionship, and we two can hold our own with the bravest.”"
7171,BOOK XIII.,
7172,BOOK XIII.,"Therewith the god went back into the thick of the fight, and"
7173,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus when he had reached his tent donned his armour, grasped"
7174,BOOK XIII.,"his two spears, and sallied forth. As the lightning which the son"
7175,BOOK XIII.,of Saturn brandishes from bright Olympus when he would show a
7176,BOOK XIII.,"sign to mortals, and its gleam flashes far and wide—even so did"
7177,BOOK XIII.,his armour gleam about him as he ran. Meriones his sturdy squire
7178,BOOK XIII.,met him while he was still near his tent (for he was going to
7179,BOOK XIII.,fetch his spear) and Idomeneus said:
7180,BOOK XIII.,
7181,BOOK XIII.,"“Meriones, fleet son of Molus, best of comrades, why have you"
7182,BOOK XIII.,"left the field? Are you wounded, and is the point of the weapon"
7183,BOOK XIII.,hurting you? or have you been sent to fetch me? I want no
7184,BOOK XIII.,fetching; I had far rather fight than stay in my tent.”
7185,BOOK XIII.,
7186,BOOK XIII.,"“Idomeneus,” answered Meriones, “I come for a spear, if I can"
7187,BOOK XIII.,"find one in my tent; I have broken the one I had, in throwing it"
7188,BOOK XIII.,at the shield of Deiphobus.”
7189,BOOK XIII.,
7190,BOOK XIII.,"And Idomeneus captain of the Cretans answered, “You will find one"
7191,BOOK XIII.,"spear, or twenty if you so please, standing up against the end"
7192,BOOK XIII.,wall of my tent. I have taken them from Trojans whom I have
7193,BOOK XIII.,"killed, for I am not one to keep my enemy at arm’s length;"
7194,BOOK XIII.,"therefore I have spears, bossed shields, helmets, and burnished"
7195,BOOK XIII.,corslets.”
7196,BOOK XIII.,
7197,BOOK XIII.,"Then Meriones said, “I too in my tent and at my ship have spoils"
7198,BOOK XIII.,"taken from the Trojans, but they are not at hand. I have been at"
7199,BOOK XIII.,"all times valorous, and wherever there has been hard fighting"
7200,BOOK XIII.,have held my own among the foremost. There may be those among the
7201,BOOK XIII.,"Achaeans who do not know how I fight, but you know it well enough"
7202,BOOK XIII.,yourself.”
7203,BOOK XIII.,
7204,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus answered, “I know you for a brave man: you need not"
7205,BOOK XIII.,tell me. If the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on
7206,BOOK XIII.,an ambush—and there is nothing like this for showing what a man
7207,BOOK XIII.,is made of; it comes out then who is cowardly and who brave; the
7208,BOOK XIII.,coward will change colour at every touch and turn; he is full of
7209,BOOK XIII.,"fears, and keeps shifting his weight first on one knee and then"
7210,BOOK XIII.,"on the other; his heart beats fast as he thinks of death, and one"
7211,BOOK XIII.,can hear the chattering of his teeth; whereas the brave man will
7212,BOOK XIII.,"not change colour nor be frightened on finding himself in ambush,"
7213,BOOK XIII.,but is all the time longing to go into action—if the best men
7214,BOOK XIII.,"were being chosen for such a service, no one could make light of"
7215,BOOK XIII.,your courage nor feats of arms. If you were struck by a dart or
7216,BOOK XIII.,"smitten in close combat, it would not be from behind, in your"
7217,BOOK XIII.,"neck nor back, but the weapon would hit you in the chest or belly"
7218,BOOK XIII.,as you were pressing forward to a place in the front ranks. But
7219,BOOK XIII.,"let us no longer stay here talking like children, lest we be ill"
7220,BOOK XIII.,"spoken of; go, fetch your spear from the tent at once.”"
7221,BOOK XIII.,
7222,BOOK XIII.,"On this Meriones, peer of Mars, went to the tent and got himself"
7223,BOOK XIII.,"a spear of bronze. He then followed after Idomeneus, big with"
7224,BOOK XIII.,great deeds of valour. As when baneful Mars sallies forth to
7225,BOOK XIII.,"battle, and his son Panic so strong and dauntless goes with him,"
7226,BOOK XIII.,to strike terror even into the heart of a hero—the pair have gone
7227,BOOK XIII.,from Thrace to arm themselves among the Ephyri or the brave
7228,BOOK XIII.,"Phlegyans, but they will not listen to both the contending hosts,"
7229,BOOK XIII.,and will give victory to one side or to the other—even so did
7230,BOOK XIII.,"Meriones and Idomeneus, captains of men, go out to battle clad in"
7231,BOOK XIII.,their bronze armour. Meriones was first to speak. “Son of
7232,BOOK XIII.,"Deucalion,” said he, “where would you have us begin fighting? On"
7233,BOOK XIII.,"the right wing of the host, in the centre, or on the left wing,"
7234,BOOK XIII.,where I take it the Achaeans will be weakest?”
7235,BOOK XIII.,
7236,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus answered, “There are others to defend the centre—the"
7237,BOOK XIII.,"two Ajaxes and Teucer, who is the finest archer of all the"
7238,BOOK XIII.,"Achaeans, and is good also in a hand-to-hand fight. These will"
7239,BOOK XIII.,"give Hector son of Priam enough to do; fight as he may, he will"
7240,BOOK XIII.,"find it hard to vanquish their indomitable fury, and fire the"
7241,BOOK XIII.,"ships, unless the son of Saturn fling a firebrand upon them with"
7242,BOOK XIII.,his own hand. Great Ajax son of Telamon will yield to no man who
7243,BOOK XIII.,"is in mortal mould and eats the grain of Ceres, if bronze and"
7244,BOOK XIII.,great stones can overthrow him. He would not yield even to
7245,BOOK XIII.,"Achilles in hand-to-hand fight, and in fleetness of foot there is"
7246,BOOK XIII.,"none to beat him; let us turn therefore towards the left wing,"
7247,BOOK XIII.,that we may know forthwith whether we are to give glory to some
7248,BOOK XIII.,"other, or he to us.”"
7249,BOOK XIII.,
7250,BOOK XIII.,"Meriones, peer of fleet Mars, then led the way till they came to"
7251,BOOK XIII.,the part of the host which Idomeneus had named.
7252,BOOK XIII.,
7253,BOOK XIII.,Now when the Trojans saw Idomeneus coming on like a flame of
7254,BOOK XIII.,"fire, him and his squire clad in their richly wrought armour,"
7255,BOOK XIII.,"they shouted and made towards him all in a body, and a furious"
7256,BOOK XIII.,hand-to-hand fight raged under the ships’ sterns. Fierce as the
7257,BOOK XIII.,shrill winds that whistle upon a day when dust lies deep on the
7258,BOOK XIII.,"roads, and the gusts raise it into a thick cloud—even such was"
7259,BOOK XIII.,"the fury of the combat, and might and main did they hack at each"
7260,BOOK XIII.,other with spear and sword throughout the host. The field
7261,BOOK XIII.,bristled with the long and deadly spears which they bore.
7262,BOOK XIII.,"Dazzling was the sheen of their gleaming helmets, their"
7263,BOOK XIII.,"fresh-burnished breastplates, and glittering shields as they"
7264,BOOK XIII.,joined battle with one another. Iron indeed must be his courage
7265,BOOK XIII.,"who could take pleasure in the sight of such a turmoil, and look"
7266,BOOK XIII.,on it without being dismayed.
7267,BOOK XIII.,
7268,BOOK XIII.,Thus did the two mighty sons of Saturn devise evil for mortal
7269,BOOK XIII.,heroes. Jove was minded to give victory to the Trojans and to
7270,BOOK XIII.,"Hector, so as to do honour to fleet Achilles, nevertheless he did"
7271,BOOK XIII.,"not mean to utterly overthrow the Achaean host before Ilius, and"
7272,BOOK XIII.,only wanted to glorify Thetis and her valiant son. Neptune on the
7273,BOOK XIII.,"other hand went about among the Argives to incite them, having"
7274,BOOK XIII.,"come up from the grey sea in secret, for he was grieved at seeing"
7275,BOOK XIII.,"them vanquished by the Trojans, and was furiously angry with"
7276,BOOK XIII.,"Jove. Both were of the same race and country, but Jove was elder"
7277,BOOK XIII.,"born and knew more, therefore Neptune feared to defend the"
7278,BOOK XIII.,"Argives openly, but in the likeness of man, he kept on"
7279,BOOK XIII.,"encouraging them throughout their host. Thus, then, did these two"
7280,BOOK XIII.,"devise a knot of war and battle, that none could unloose or"
7281,BOOK XIII.,"break, and set both sides tugging at it, to the failing of men’s"
7282,BOOK XIII.,knees beneath them.
7283,BOOK XIII.,
7284,BOOK XIII.,"And now Idomeneus, though his hair was already flecked with grey,"
7285,BOOK XIII.,called loud on the Danaans and spread panic among the Trojans as
7286,BOOK XIII.,"he leaped in among them. He slew Othryoneus from Cabesus, a"
7287,BOOK XIII.,"sojourner, who had but lately come to take part in the war. He"
7288,BOOK XIII.,"sought Cassandra, the fairest of Priam’s daughters, in marriage,"
7289,BOOK XIII.,"but offered no gifts of wooing, for he promised a great thing, to"
7290,BOOK XIII.,"wit, that he would drive the sons of the Achaeans willy nilly"
7291,BOOK XIII.,from Troy; old King Priam had given his consent and promised her
7292,BOOK XIII.,"to him, whereon he fought on the strength of the promises thus"
7293,BOOK XIII.,"made to him. Idomeneus aimed a spear, and hit him as he came"
7294,BOOK XIII.,"striding on. His cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and the"
7295,BOOK XIII.,"spear stuck in his belly, so that he fell heavily to the ground."
7296,BOOK XIII.,"Then Idomeneus vaunted over him saying, “Othryoneus, there is no"
7297,BOOK XIII.,"one in the world whom I shall admire more than I do you, if you"
7298,BOOK XIII.,indeed perform what you have promised Priam son of Dardanus in
7299,BOOK XIII.,return for his daughter. We too will make you an offer; we will
7300,BOOK XIII.,"give you the loveliest daughter of the son of Atreus, and will"
7301,BOOK XIII.,"bring her from Argos for you to marry, if you will sack the"
7302,BOOK XIII.,goodly city of Ilius in company with ourselves; so come along
7303,BOOK XIII.,"with me, that we may make a covenant at the ships about the"
7304,BOOK XIII.,"marriage, and we will not be hard upon you about gifts of"
7305,BOOK XIII.,wooing.”
7306,BOOK XIII.,
7307,BOOK XIII.,With this Idomeneus began dragging him by the foot through the
7308,BOOK XIII.,"thick of the fight, but Asius came up to protect the body, on"
7309,BOOK XIII.,"foot, in front of his horses which his esquire drove so close"
7310,BOOK XIII.,behind him that he could feel their breath upon his shoulder. He
7311,BOOK XIII.,"was longing to strike down Idomeneus, but ere he could do so"
7312,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus smote him with his spear in the throat under the chin,"
7313,BOOK XIII.,"and the bronze point went clean through it. He fell as an oak, or"
7314,BOOK XIII.,"poplar, or pine which shipwrights have felled for ship’s timber"
7315,BOOK XIII.,upon the mountains with whetted axes—even thus did he lie full
7316,BOOK XIII.,"length in front of his chariot and horses, grinding his teeth and"
7317,BOOK XIII.,clutching at the blood-stained dust. His charioteer was struck
7318,BOOK XIII.,with panic and did not dare turn his horses round and escape:
7319,BOOK XIII.,thereupon Antilochus hit him in the middle of his body with a
7320,BOOK XIII.,"spear; his cuirass of bronze did not protect him, and the spear"
7321,BOOK XIII.,stuck in his belly. He fell gasping from his chariot and
7322,BOOK XIII.,"Antilochus, great Nestor’s son, drove his horses from the Trojans"
7323,BOOK XIII.,to the Achaeans.
7324,BOOK XIII.,
7325,BOOK XIII.,"Deiphobus then came close up to Idomeneus to avenge Asius, and"
7326,BOOK XIII.,"took aim at him with a spear, but Idomeneus was on the look-out"
7327,BOOK XIII.,"and avoided it, for he was covered by the round shield he always"
7328,BOOK XIII.,bore—a shield of ox-hide and bronze with two arm-rods on the
7329,BOOK XIII.,"inside. He crouched under cover of this, and the spear flew over"
7330,BOOK XIII.,"him, but the shield rang out as the spear grazed it, and the"
7331,BOOK XIII.,"weapon sped not in vain from the strong hand of Deiphobus, for it"
7332,BOOK XIII.,"struck Hypsenor son of Hippasus, shepherd of his people, in the"
7333,BOOK XIII.,"liver under the midriff, and his limbs failed beneath him."
7334,BOOK XIII.,"Deiphobus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying,"
7335,BOOK XIII.,“Of a truth Asius has not fallen unavenged; he will be glad even
7336,BOOK XIII.,"while passing into the house of Hades, strong warden of the gate,"
7337,BOOK XIII.,that I have sent some one to escort him.”
7338,BOOK XIII.,
7339,BOOK XIII.,"Thus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung by his saying."
7340,BOOK XIII.,"Noble Antilochus was more angry than any one, but grief did not"
7341,BOOK XIII.,"make him forget his friend and comrade. He ran up to him,"
7342,BOOK XIII.,"bestrode him, and covered him with his shield; then two of his"
7343,BOOK XIII.,"staunch comrades, Mecisteus son of Echius, and Alastor, stooped"
7344,BOOK XIII.,"down, and bore him away groaning heavily to the ships. But"
7345,BOOK XIII.,Idomeneus ceased not his fury. He kept on striving continually
7346,BOOK XIII.,"either to enshroud some Trojan in the darkness of death, or"
7347,BOOK XIII.,himself to fall while warding off the evil day from the Achaeans.
7348,BOOK XIII.,Then fell Alcathous son of noble Aesyetes; he was son-in-law to
7349,BOOK XIII.,"Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameia, who was"
7350,BOOK XIII.,"the darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her"
7351,BOOK XIII.,"generation in beauty, accomplishments, and understanding,"
7352,BOOK XIII.,wherefore the bravest man in all Troy had taken her to wife—him
7353,BOOK XIII.,"did Neptune lay low by the hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright"
7354,BOOK XIII.,eyes and binding his strong limbs in fetters so that he could
7355,BOOK XIII.,"neither go back nor to one side, but stood stock still like"
7356,BOOK XIII.,pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus struck him with a spear in
7357,BOOK XIII.,the middle of his chest. The coat of mail that had hitherto
7358,BOOK XIII.,"protected his body was now broken, and rang harshly as the spear"
7359,BOOK XIII.,"tore through it. He fell heavily to the ground, and the spear"
7360,BOOK XIII.,"stuck in his heart, which still beat, and made the butt-end of"
7361,BOOK XIII.,the spear quiver till dread Mars put an end to his life.
7362,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying,"
7363,BOOK XIII.,"“Deiphobus, since you are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits"
7364,BOOK XIII.,"now that we have killed three men to your one? Nay, sir, stand in"
7365,BOOK XIII.,"fight with me yourself, that you may learn what manner of"
7366,BOOK XIII.,Jove-begotten man am I that have come hither. Jove first begot
7367,BOOK XIII.,"Minos, chief ruler in Crete, and Minos in his turn begot a son,"
7368,BOOK XIII.,noble Deucalion. Deucalion begot me to be a ruler over many men
7369,BOOK XIII.,"in Crete, and my ships have now brought me hither, to be the bane"
7370,BOOK XIII.,"of yourself, your father, and the Trojans.”"
7371,BOOK XIII.,
7372,BOOK XIII.,"Thus did he speak, and Deiphobus was in two minds, whether to go"
7373,BOOK XIII.,"back and fetch some other Trojan to help him, or to take up the"
7374,BOOK XIII.,"challenge single-handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and"
7375,BOOK XIII.,"fetch Aeneas, whom he found standing in the rear, for he had long"
7376,BOOK XIII.,been aggrieved with Priam because in spite of his brave deeds he
7377,BOOK XIII.,did not give him his due share of honour. Deiphobus went up to
7378,BOOK XIII.,"him and said, “Aeneas, prince among the Trojans, if you know any"
7379,BOOK XIII.,"ties of kinship, help me now to defend the body of your sister’s"
7380,BOOK XIII.,"husband; come with me to the rescue of Alcathous, who being"
7381,BOOK XIII.,husband to your sister brought you up when you were a child in
7382,BOOK XIII.,"his house, and now Idomeneus has slain him.”"
7383,BOOK XIII.,
7384,BOOK XIII.,"With these words he moved the heart of Aeneas, and he went in"
7385,BOOK XIII.,"pursuit of Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valour; but"
7386,BOOK XIII.,Idomeneus was not to be thus daunted as though he were a mere
7387,BOOK XIII.,child; he held his ground as a wild boar at bay upon the
7388,BOOK XIII.,"mountains, who abides the coming of a great crowd of men in some"
7389,BOOK XIII.,"lonely place—the bristles stand upright on his back, his eyes"
7390,BOOK XIII.,"flash fire, and he whets his tusks in his eagerness to defend"
7391,BOOK XIII.,himself against hounds and men—even so did famed Idomeneus hold
7392,BOOK XIII.,his ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas. He cried aloud
7393,BOOK XIII.,"to his comrades looking towards Ascalaphus, Aphareus, Deipyrus,"
7394,BOOK XIII.,"Meriones, and Antilochus, all of them brave soldiers—“Hither my"
7395,BOOK XIII.,"friends,” he cried, “and leave me not single-handed—I go in great"
7396,BOOK XIII.,"fear by fleet Aeneas, who is coming against me, and is a"
7397,BOOK XIII.,redoubtable dispenser of death battle. Moreover he is in the
7398,BOOK XIII.,flower of youth when a man’s strength is greatest; if I was of
7399,BOOK XIII.,"the same age as he is and in my present mind, either he or I"
7400,BOOK XIII.,should soon bear away the prize of victory.”
7401,BOOK XIII.,
7402,BOOK XIII.,"On this, all of them as one man stood near him, shield on"
7403,BOOK XIII.,"shoulder. Aeneas on the other side called to his comrades,"
7404,BOOK XIII.,"looking towards Deiphobus, Paris, and Agenor, who were leaders of"
7405,BOOK XIII.,"the Trojans along with himself, and the people followed them as"
7406,BOOK XIII.,sheep follow the ram when they go down to drink after they have
7407,BOOK XIII.,"been feeding, and the heart of the shepherd is glad—even so was"
7408,BOOK XIII.,the heart of Aeneas gladdened when he saw his people follow him.
7409,BOOK XIII.,
7410,BOOK XIII.,Then they fought furiously in close combat about the body of
7411,BOOK XIII.,"Alcathous, wielding their long spears; and the bronze armour"
7412,BOOK XIII.,about their bodies rang fearfully as they took aim at one another
7413,BOOK XIII.,"in the press of the fight, while the two heroes Aeneas and"
7414,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus, peers of Mars, outvied everyone in their desire to"
7415,BOOK XIII.,"hack at each other with sword and spear. Aeneas took aim first,"
7416,BOOK XIII.,"but Idomeneus was on the look-out and avoided the spear, so that"
7417,BOOK XIII.,"it sped from Aeneas’ strong hand in vain, and fell quivering in"
7418,BOOK XIII.,the ground. Idomeneus meanwhile smote Oenomaus in the middle of
7419,BOOK XIII.,"his belly, and broke the plate of his corslet, whereon his bowels"
7420,BOOK XIII.,came gushing out and he clutched the earth in the palms of his
7421,BOOK XIII.,hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. Idomeneus drew his spear
7422,BOOK XIII.,"out of the body, but could not strip him of the rest of his"
7423,BOOK XIII.,armour for the rain of darts that were showered upon him:
7424,BOOK XIII.,moreover his strength was now beginning to fail him so that he
7425,BOOK XIII.,"could no longer charge, and could neither spring forward to"
7426,BOOK XIII.,recover his own weapon nor swerve aside to avoid one that was
7427,BOOK XIII.,"aimed at him; therefore, though he still defended himself in"
7428,BOOK XIII.,"hand-to-hand fight, his heavy feet could not bear him swiftly out"
7429,BOOK XIII.,of the battle. Deiphobus aimed a spear at him as he was
7430,BOOK XIII.,"retreating slowly from the field, for his bitterness against him"
7431,BOOK XIII.,"was as fierce as ever, but again he missed him, and hit"
7432,BOOK XIII.,"Ascalaphus, the son of Mars; the spear went through his shoulder,"
7433,BOOK XIII.,and he clutched the earth in the palms of his hands as he fell
7434,BOOK XIII.,sprawling in the dust.
7435,BOOK XIII.,
7436,BOOK XIII.,Grim Mars of awful voice did not yet know that his son had
7437,BOOK XIII.,"fallen, for he was sitting on the summits of Olympus under the"
7438,BOOK XIII.,"golden clouds, by command of Jove, where the other gods were also"
7439,BOOK XIII.,"sitting, forbidden to take part in the battle. Meanwhile men"
7440,BOOK XIII.,fought furiously about the body. Deiphobus tore the helmet from
7441,BOOK XIII.,"off his head, but Meriones sprang upon him, and struck him on the"
7442,BOOK XIII.,arm with a spear so that the visored helmet fell from his hand
7443,BOOK XIII.,and came ringing down upon the ground. Thereon Meriones sprang
7444,BOOK XIII.,"upon him like a vulture, drew the spear from his shoulder, and"
7445,BOOK XIII.,"fell back under cover of his men. Then Polites, own brother of"
7446,BOOK XIII.,"Deiphobus passed his arms around his waist, and bore him away"
7447,BOOK XIII.,from the battle till he got to his horses that were standing in
7448,BOOK XIII.,the rear of the fight with the chariot and their driver. These
7449,BOOK XIII.,"took him towards the city groaning and in great pain, with the"
7450,BOOK XIII.,blood flowing from his arm.
7451,BOOK XIII.,
7452,BOOK XIII.,"The others still fought on, and the battle-cry rose to heaven"
7453,BOOK XIII.,"without ceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of Caletor, and"
7454,BOOK XIII.,struck him with a spear in his throat which was turned towards
7455,BOOK XIII.,"him; his head fell on one side, his helmet and shield came down"
7456,BOOK XIII.,"along with him, and death, life’s foe, was shed around him."
7457,BOOK XIII.,"Antilochus spied his chance, flew forward towards Thoon, and"
7458,BOOK XIII.,wounded him as he was turning round. He laid open the vein that
7459,BOOK XIII.,runs all the way up the back to the neck; he cut this vein clean
7460,BOOK XIII.,"away throughout its whole course, and Thoon fell in the dust face"
7461,BOOK XIII.,"upwards, stretching out his hands imploringly towards his"
7462,BOOK XIII.,comrades. Antilochus sprang upon him and stripped the armour from
7463,BOOK XIII.,"his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully as he did so. The"
7464,BOOK XIII.,Trojans came about him on every side and struck his broad and
7465,BOOK XIII.,"gleaming shield, but could not wound his body, for Neptune stood"
7466,BOOK XIII.,"guard over the son of Nestor, though the darts fell thickly round"
7467,BOOK XIII.,"him. He was never clear of the foe, but was always in the thick"
7468,BOOK XIII.,of the fight; his spear was never idle; he poised and aimed it in
7469,BOOK XIII.,"every direction, so eager was he to hit someone from a distance"
7470,BOOK XIII.,or to fight him hand to hand.
7471,BOOK XIII.,
7472,BOOK XIII.,"As he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was seen by Adamas, son"
7473,BOOK XIII.,"of Asius, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear in"
7474,BOOK XIII.,"the middle of his shield, but Neptune made its point without"
7475,BOOK XIII.,"effect, for he grudged him the life of Antilochus. One half,"
7476,BOOK XIII.,"therefore, of the spear stuck fast like a charred stake in"
7477,BOOK XIII.,"Antilochus’s shield, while the other lay on the ground. Adamas"
7478,BOOK XIII.,"then sought shelter under cover of his men, but Meriones followed"
7479,BOOK XIII.,after and hit him with a spear midway between the private parts
7480,BOOK XIII.,"and the navel, where a wound is particularly painful to wretched"
7481,BOOK XIII.,"mortals. There did Meriones transfix him, and he writhed"
7482,BOOK XIII.,convulsively about the spear as some bull whom mountain herdsmen
7483,BOOK XIII.,have bound with ropes of withes and are taking away perforce.
7484,BOOK XIII.,"Even so did he move convulsively for a while, but not for very"
7485,BOOK XIII.,"long, till Meriones came up and drew the spear out of his body,"
7486,BOOK XIII.,and his eyes were veiled in darkness.
7487,BOOK XIII.,
7488,BOOK XIII.,"Helenus then struck Deipyrus with a great Thracian sword, hitting"
7489,BOOK XIII.,him on the temple in close combat and tearing the helmet from his
7490,BOOK XIII.,"head; the helmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were"
7491,BOOK XIII.,fighting on the Achaean side took charge of it as it rolled at
7492,BOOK XIII.,"his feet, but the eyes of Deipyrus were closed in the darkness of"
7493,BOOK XIII.,death.
7494,BOOK XIII.,
7495,BOOK XIII.,"On this Menelaus was grieved, and made menacingly towards"
7496,BOOK XIII.,"Helenus, brandishing his spear; but Helenus drew his bow, and the"
7497,BOOK XIII.,"two attacked one another at one and the same moment, the one with"
7498,BOOK XIII.,"his spear, and the other with his bow and arrow. The son of Priam"
7499,BOOK XIII.,"hit the breastplate of Menelaus’s corslet, but the arrow glanced"
7500,BOOK XIII.,from off it. As black beans or pulse come pattering down on to a
7501,BOOK XIII.,"threshing-floor from the broad winnowing-shovel, blown by shrill"
7502,BOOK XIII.,winds and shaken by the shovel—even so did the arrow glance off
7503,BOOK XIII.,"and recoil from the shield of Menelaus, who in his turn wounded"
7504,BOOK XIII.,the hand with which Helenus carried his bow; the spear went right
7505,BOOK XIII.,"through his hand and stuck in the bow itself, so that to his life"
7506,BOOK XIII.,"he retreated under cover of his men, with his hand dragging by"
7507,BOOK XIII.,his side—for the spear weighed it down till Agenor drew it out
7508,BOOK XIII.,and bound the hand carefully up in a woollen sling which his
7509,BOOK XIII.,esquire had with him.
7510,BOOK XIII.,
7511,BOOK XIII.,Pisander then made straight at Menelaus—his evil destiny luring
7512,BOOK XIII.,"him on to his doom, for he was to fall in fight with you, O"
7513,BOOK XIII.,Menelaus. When the two were hard by one another the spear of the
7514,BOOK XIII.,son of Atreus turned aside and he missed his aim; Pisander then
7515,BOOK XIII.,"struck the shield of brave Menelaus but could not pierce it, for"
7516,BOOK XIII.,the shield stayed the spear and broke the shaft; nevertheless he
7517,BOOK XIII.,"was glad and made sure of victory; forthwith, however, the son of"
7518,BOOK XIII.,Atreus drew his sword and sprang upon him. Pisander then seized
7519,BOOK XIII.,"the bronze battle-axe, with its long and polished handle of olive"
7520,BOOK XIII.,"wood that hung by his side under his shield, and the two made at"
7521,BOOK XIII.,one another. Pisander struck the peak of Menelaus’s crested
7522,BOOK XIII.,"helmet just under the crest itself, and Menelaus hit Pisander as"
7523,BOOK XIII.,"he was coming towards him, on the forehead, just at the rise of"
7524,BOOK XIII.,his nose; the bones cracked and his two gore-bedrabbled eyes fell
7525,BOOK XIII.,"by his feet in the dust. He fell backwards to the ground, and"
7526,BOOK XIII.,"Menelaus set his heel upon him, stripped him of his armour, and"
7527,BOOK XIII.,"vaunted over him saying, “Even thus shall you Trojans leave the"
7528,BOOK XIII.,"ships of the Achaeans, proud and insatiate of battle though you"
7529,BOOK XIII.,"be, nor shall you lack any of the disgrace and shame which you"
7530,BOOK XIII.,"have heaped upon myself. Cowardly she-wolves that you are, you"
7531,BOOK XIII.,"feared not the anger of dread Jove, avenger of violated"
7532,BOOK XIII.,"hospitality, who will one day destroy your city; you stole my"
7533,BOOK XIII.,wedded wife and wickedly carried off much treasure when you were
7534,BOOK XIII.,"her guest, and now you would fling fire upon our ships, and kill"
7535,BOOK XIII.,"our heroes. A day will come when, rage as you may, you shall be"
7536,BOOK XIII.,"stayed. O father Jove, you, who they say art above all, both gods"
7537,BOOK XIII.,"and men, in wisdom, and from whom all things that befall us do"
7538,BOOK XIII.,"proceed, how can you thus favour the Trojans—men so proud and"
7539,BOOK XIII.,"overweening, that they are never tired of fighting? All things"
7540,BOOK XIII.,"pall after a while—sleep, love, sweet song, and stately"
7541,BOOK XIII.,dance—still these are things of which a man would surely have his
7542,BOOK XIII.,"fill rather than of battle, whereas it is of battle that the"
7543,BOOK XIII.,Trojans are insatiate.”
7544,BOOK XIII.,
7545,BOOK XIII.,So saying Menelaus stripped the blood-stained armour from the
7546,BOOK XIII.,"body of Pisander, and handed it over to his men; then he again"
7547,BOOK XIII.,ranged himself among those who were in the front of the fight.
7548,BOOK XIII.,
7549,BOOK XIII.,Harpalion son of King Pylaemenes then sprang upon him; he had
7550,BOOK XIII.,"come to fight at Troy along with his father, but he did not go"
7551,BOOK XIII.,home again. He struck the middle of Menelaus’s shield with his
7552,BOOK XIII.,"spear but could not pierce it, and to save his life drew back"
7553,BOOK XIII.,"under cover of his men, looking round him on every side lest he"
7554,BOOK XIII.,should be wounded. But Meriones aimed a bronze-tipped arrow at
7555,BOOK XIII.,"him as he was leaving the field, and hit him on the right"
7556,BOOK XIII.,"buttock; the arrow pierced the bone through and through, and"
7557,BOOK XIII.,"penetrated the bladder, so he sat down where he was and breathed"
7558,BOOK XIII.,"his last in the arms of his comrades, stretched like a worm upon"
7559,BOOK XIII.,the ground and watering the earth with the blood that flowed from
7560,BOOK XIII.,his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended him with all due care;
7561,BOOK XIII.,"they raised him into his chariot, and bore him sadly off to the"
7562,BOOK XIII.,"city of Troy; his father went also with him weeping bitterly, but"
7563,BOOK XIII.,there was no ransom that could bring his dead son to life again.
7564,BOOK XIII.,
7565,BOOK XIII.,"Paris was deeply grieved by the death of Harpalion, who was his"
7566,BOOK XIII.,"host when he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed an arrow,"
7567,BOOK XIII.,"therefore, in order to avenge him. Now there was a certain man"
7568,BOOK XIII.,"named Euchenor, son of Polyidus the prophet, a brave man and"
7569,BOOK XIII.,"wealthy, whose home was in Corinth. This Euchenor had set sail"
7570,BOOK XIII.,"for Troy well knowing that it would be the death of him, for his"
7571,BOOK XIII.,good old father Polyidus had often told him that he must either
7572,BOOK XIII.,"stay at home and die of a terrible disease, or go with the"
7573,BOOK XIII.,"Achaeans and perish at the hands of the Trojans; he chose,"
7574,BOOK XIII.,"therefore, to avoid incurring the heavy fine the Achaeans would"
7575,BOOK XIII.,"have laid upon him, and at the same time to escape the pain and"
7576,BOOK XIII.,suffering of disease. Paris now smote him on the jaw under his
7577,BOOK XIII.,"ear, whereon the life went out of him and he was enshrouded in"
7578,BOOK XIII.,the darkness of death.
7579,BOOK XIII.,
7580,BOOK XIII.,Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. But Hector
7581,BOOK XIII.,"had not yet heard, and did not know that the Argives were making"
7582,BOOK XIII.,"havoc of his men on the left wing of the battle, where the"
7583,BOOK XIII.,"Achaeans ere long would have triumphed over them, so vigorously"
7584,BOOK XIII.,did Neptune cheer them on and help them. He therefore held on at
7585,BOOK XIII.,the point where he had first forced his way through the gates and
7586,BOOK XIII.,"the wall, after breaking through the serried ranks of Danaan"
7587,BOOK XIII.,warriors. It was here that the ships of Ajax and Protesilaus were
7588,BOOK XIII.,"drawn up by the sea-shore; here the wall was at its lowest, and"
7589,BOOK XIII.,the fight both of man and horse raged most fiercely. The
7590,BOOK XIII.,"Boeotians and the Ionians with their long tunics, the Locrians,"
7591,BOOK XIII.,"the men of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeans could"
7592,BOOK XIII.,"hardly stay Hector as he rushed on towards the ships, nor could"
7593,BOOK XIII.,"they drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire. The"
7594,BOOK XIII.,"chosen men of the Athenians were in the van, led by Menestheus"
7595,BOOK XIII.,"son of Peteos, with whom were also Pheidas, Stichius, and"
7596,BOOK XIII.,"stalwart Bias; Meges son of Phyleus, Amphion, and Dracius"
7597,BOOK XIII.,"commanded the Epeans, while Medon and staunch Podarces led the"
7598,BOOK XIII.,"men of Phthia. Of these, Medon was bastard son to Oileus and"
7599,BOOK XIII.,"brother of Ajax, but he lived in Phylace away from his own"
7600,BOOK XIII.,"country, for he had killed the brother of his stepmother Eriopis,"
7601,BOOK XIII.,"the wife of Oileus; the other, Podarces, was the son of Iphiclus,"
7602,BOOK XIII.,"son of Phylacus. These two stood in the van of the Phthians, and"
7603,BOOK XIII.,defended the ships along with the Boeotians.
7604,BOOK XIII.,
7605,BOOK XIII.,"Ajax son of Oileus, never for a moment left the side of Ajax, son"
7606,BOOK XIII.,"of Telamon, but as two swart oxen both strain their utmost at the"
7607,BOOK XIII.,"plough which they are drawing in a fallow field, and the sweat"
7608,BOOK XIII.,steams upwards from about the roots of their horns—nothing but
7609,BOOK XIII.,the yoke divides them as they break up the ground till they reach
7610,BOOK XIII.,the end of the field—even so did the two Ajaxes stand shoulder to
7611,BOOK XIII.,shoulder by one another. Many and brave comrades followed the son
7612,BOOK XIII.,"of Telamon, to relieve him of his shield when he was overcome"
7613,BOOK XIII.,"with sweat and toil, but the Locrians did not follow so close"
7614,BOOK XIII.,"after the son of Oileus, for they could not hold their own in a"
7615,BOOK XIII.,hand-to-hand fight. They had no bronze helmets with plumes of
7616,BOOK XIII.,"horse-hair, neither had they shields nor ashen spears, but they"
7617,BOOK XIII.,"had come to Troy armed with bows, and with slings of twisted wool"
7618,BOOK XIII.,from which they showered their missiles to break the ranks of the
7619,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans. The others, therefore, with their heavy armour bore the"
7620,BOOK XIII.,"brunt of the fight with the Trojans and with Hector, while the"
7621,BOOK XIII.,"Locrians shot from behind, under their cover; and thus the"
7622,BOOK XIII.,"Trojans began to lose heart, for the arrows threw them into"
7623,BOOK XIII.,confusion.
7624,BOOK XIII.,
7625,BOOK XIII.,The Trojans would now have been driven in sorry plight from the
7626,BOOK XIII.,"ships and tents back to windy Ilius, had not Polydamas presently"
7627,BOOK XIII.,"said to Hector, “Hector, there is no persuading you to take"
7628,BOOK XIII.,advice. Because heaven has so richly endowed you with the arts of
7629,BOOK XIII.,"war, you think that you must therefore excel others in counsel;"
7630,BOOK XIII.,but you cannot thus claim preeminence in all things. Heaven has
7631,BOOK XIII.,made one man an excellent soldier; of another it has made a
7632,BOOK XIII.,dancer or a singer and player on the lyre; while yet in another
7633,BOOK XIII.,Jove has implanted a wise understanding of which men reap fruit
7634,BOOK XIII.,"to the saving of many, and he himself knows more about it than"
7635,BOOK XIII.,any one; therefore I will say what I think will be best. The
7636,BOOK XIII.,"fight has hemmed you in as with a circle of fire, and even now"
7637,BOOK XIII.,that the Trojans are within the wall some of them stand aloof in
7638,BOOK XIII.,"full armour, while others are fighting scattered and outnumbered"
7639,BOOK XIII.,"near the ships. Draw back, therefore, and call your chieftains"
7640,BOOK XIII.,"round you, that we may advise together whether to fall now upon"
7641,BOOK XIII.,"the ships in the hope that heaven may vouchsafe us victory, or to"
7642,BOOK XIII.,beat a retreat while we can yet safely do so. I greatly fear that
7643,BOOK XIII.,"the Achaeans will pay us their debt of yesterday in full, for"
7644,BOOK XIII.,"there is one abiding at their ships who is never weary of battle,"
7645,BOOK XIII.,and who will not hold aloof much longer.”
7646,BOOK XIII.,
7647,BOOK XIII.,"Thus spoke Polydamas, and his words pleased Hector well. He"
7648,BOOK XIII.,"sprang in full armour from his chariot and said, “Polydamas,"
7649,BOOK XIII.,"gather the chieftains here; I will go yonder into the fight, but"
7650,BOOK XIII.,will return at once when I have given them their orders.”
7651,BOOK XIII.,
7652,BOOK XIII.,"He then sped onward, towering like a snowy mountain, and with a"
7653,BOOK XIII.,loud cry flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies.
7654,BOOK XIII.,When they heard his voice they all hastened to gather round
7655,BOOK XIII.,"Polydamas, the excellent son of Panthous, but Hector kept on"
7656,BOOK XIII.,"among the foremost, looking everywhere to find Deiphobus and"
7657,BOOK XIII.,"prince Helenus, Adamas son of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus;"
7658,BOOK XIII.,"living, indeed, and scatheless he could no longer find them, for"
7659,BOOK XIII.,"the two last were lying by the sterns of the Achaean ships, slain"
7660,BOOK XIII.,"by the Argives, while the others had been also stricken and"
7661,BOOK XIII.,wounded by them; but upon the left wing of the dread battle he
7662,BOOK XIII.,"found Alexandrus, husband of lovely Helen, cheering his men and"
7663,BOOK XIII.,urging them on to fight. He went up to him and upbraided him.
7664,BOOK XIII.,"“Paris,” said he, “evil-hearted Paris, fair to see but woman-mad"
7665,BOOK XIII.,"and false of tongue, where are Deiphobus and King Helenus? Where"
7666,BOOK XIII.,"are Adamas son of Asius, and Asius son of Hyrtacus? Where too is"
7667,BOOK XIII.,Othryoneus? Ilius is undone and will now surely fall!”
7668,BOOK XIII.,
7669,BOOK XIII.,"Alexandrus answered, “Hector, why find fault when there is no one"
7670,BOOK XIII.,to find fault with? I should hold aloof from battle on any day
7671,BOOK XIII.,"rather than this, for my mother bore me with nothing of the"
7672,BOOK XIII.,coward about me. From the moment when you set our men fighting
7673,BOOK XIII.,about the ships we have been staying here and doing battle with
7674,BOOK XIII.,the Danaans. Our comrades about whom you ask me are dead;
7675,BOOK XIII.,"Deiphobus and King Helenus alone have left the field, wounded"
7676,BOOK XIII.,"both of them in the hand, but the son of Saturn saved them alive."
7677,BOOK XIII.,"Now, therefore, lead on where you would have us go, and we will"
7678,BOOK XIII.,follow with right goodwill; you shall not find us fail you in so
7679,BOOK XIII.,"far as our strength holds out, but no man can do more than in him"
7680,BOOK XIII.,"lies, no matter how willing he may be.”"
7681,BOOK XIII.,
7682,BOOK XIII.,"With these words he satisfied his brother, and the two went"
7683,BOOK XIII.,"towards the part of the battle where the fight was thickest,"
7684,BOOK XIII.,"about Cebriones, brave Polydamas, Phalces, Orthaeus, godlike"
7685,BOOK XIII.,"Polyphetes, Palmys, Ascanius, and Morys son of Hippotion, who had"
7686,BOOK XIII.,come from fertile Ascania on the preceding day to relieve other
7687,BOOK XIII.,troops. Then Jove urged them on to fight. They flew forth like
7688,BOOK XIII.,the blasts of some fierce wind that strike earth in the van of a
7689,BOOK XIII.,thunderstorm—they buffet the salt sea into an uproar; many and
7690,BOOK XIII.,mighty are the great waves that come crashing in one after the
7691,BOOK XIII.,other upon the shore with their arching heads all crested with
7692,BOOK XIII.,foam—even so did rank behind rank of Trojans arrayed in gleaming
7693,BOOK XIII.,armour follow their leaders onward. The way was led by Hector son
7694,BOOK XIII.,"of Priam, peer of murderous Mars, with his round shield before"
7695,BOOK XIII.,him—his shield of ox-hides covered with plates of bronze—and his
7696,BOOK XIII.,gleaming helmet upon his temples. He kept stepping forward under
7697,BOOK XIII.,"cover of his shield in every direction, making trial of the ranks"
7698,BOOK XIII.,"to see if they would give way before him, but he could not daunt"
7699,BOOK XIII.,the courage of the Achaeans. Ajax was the first to stride out and
7700,BOOK XIII.,"challenge him. “Sir,” he cried, “draw near; why do you think thus"
7701,BOOK XIII.,"vainly to dismay the Argives? We Achaeans are excellent soldiers,"
7702,BOOK XIII.,"but the scourge of Jove has fallen heavily upon us. Your heart,"
7703,BOOK XIII.,"forsooth, is set on destroying our ships, but we too have hands"
7704,BOOK XIII.,"that can keep you at bay, and your own fair town shall be sooner"
7705,BOOK XIII.,taken and sacked by ourselves. The time is near when you shall
7706,BOOK XIII.,"pray Jove and all the gods in your flight, that your steeds may"
7707,BOOK XIII.,be swifter than hawks as they raise the dust on the plain and
7708,BOOK XIII.,bear you back to your city.”
7709,BOOK XIII.,
7710,BOOK XIII.,"As he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand, and"
7711,BOOK XIII.,"the host of the Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the"
7712,BOOK XIII.,"omen. But Hector answered, “Ajax, braggart and false of tongue,"
7713,BOOK XIII.,would that I were as sure of being son for evermore to
7714,BOOK XIII.,"aegis-bearing Jove, with Queen Juno for my mother, and of being"
7715,BOOK XIII.,"held in like honour with Minerva and Apollo, as I am that this"
7716,BOOK XIII.,day is big with the destruction of the Achaeans; and you shall
7717,BOOK XIII.,fall among them if you dare abide my spear; it shall rend your
7718,BOOK XIII.,fair body and bid you glut our hounds and birds of prey with your
7719,BOOK XIII.,"fat and your flesh, as you fall by the ships of the Achaeans.”"
7720,BOOK XIII.,
7721,BOOK XIII.,With these words he led the way and the others followed after
7722,BOOK XIII.,"with a cry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind them."
7723,BOOK XIII.,"The Argives on their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they"
7724,BOOK XIII.,"forget their prowess, but stood firm against the onslaught of the"
7725,BOOK XIII.,"Trojan chieftains, and the cry from both the hosts rose up to"
7726,BOOK XIII.,heaven and to the brightness of Jove’s presence.

7732,BOOK XIV.,
7733,BOOK XIV.,
7734,BOOK XIV.,"Agamemnon proposes that the Achaeans should sail home, and is"
7735,BOOK XIV.,rebuked by Ulysses—Juno beguiles Jupiter—Hector is wounded.
7736,BOOK XIV.,
7737,BOOK XIV.,"Nestor was sitting over his wine, but the cry of battle did not"
7738,BOOK XIV.,"escape him, and he said to the son of Aesculapius, “What, noble"
7739,BOOK XIV.,"Machaon, is the meaning of all this? The shouts of men fighting"
7740,BOOK XIV.,"by our ships grow stronger and stronger; stay here, therefore,"
7741,BOOK XIV.,"and sit over your wine, while fair Hecamede heats you a bath and"
7742,BOOK XIV.,washes the clotted blood from off you. I will go at once to the
7743,BOOK XIV.,look-out station and see what it is all about.”
7744,BOOK XIV.,
7745,BOOK XIV.,As he spoke he took up the shield of his son Thrasymedes that was
7746,BOOK XIV.,"lying in his tent, all gleaming with bronze, for Thrasymedes had"
7747,BOOK XIV.,taken his father’s shield; he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod
7748,BOOK XIV.,"spear, and as soon as he was outside saw the disastrous rout of"
7749,BOOK XIV.,"the Achaeans who, now that their wall was overthrown, were flying"
7750,BOOK XIV.,pell-mell before the Trojans. As when there is a heavy swell upon
7751,BOOK XIV.,"the sea, but the waves are dumb—they keep their eyes on the watch"
7752,BOOK XIV.,"for the quarter whence the fierce winds may spring upon them, but"
7753,BOOK XIV.,"they stay where they are and set neither this way nor that, till"
7754,BOOK XIV.,some particular wind sweeps down from heaven to determine
7755,BOOK XIV.,them—even so did the old man ponder whether to make for the crowd
7756,BOOK XIV.,"of Danaans, or go in search of Agamemnon. In the end he deemed it"
7757,BOOK XIV.,best to go to the son of Atreus; but meanwhile the hosts were
7758,BOOK XIV.,"fighting and killing one another, and the hard bronze rattled on"
7759,BOOK XIV.,"their bodies, as they thrust at one another with their swords and"
7760,BOOK XIV.,spears.
7761,BOOK XIV.,
7762,BOOK XIV.,"The wounded kings, the son of Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon son"
7763,BOOK XIV.,"of Atreus, fell in with Nestor as they were coming up from their"
7764,BOOK XIV.,ships—for theirs were drawn up some way from where the fighting
7765,BOOK XIV.,"was going on, being on the shore itself inasmuch as they had been"
7766,BOOK XIV.,"beached first, while the wall had been built behind the"
7767,BOOK XIV.,"hindermost. The stretch of the shore, wide though it was, did not"
7768,BOOK XIV.,"afford room for all the ships, and the host was cramped for"
7769,BOOK XIV.,"space, therefore they had placed the ships in rows one behind the"
7770,BOOK XIV.,"other, and had filled the whole opening of the bay between the"
7771,BOOK XIV.,"two points that formed it. The kings, leaning on their spears,"
7772,BOOK XIV.,"were coming out to survey the fight, being in great anxiety, and"
7773,BOOK XIV.,when old Nestor met them they were filled with dismay. Then King
7774,BOOK XIV.,"Agamemnon said to him, “Nestor son of Neleus, honour to the"
7775,BOOK XIV.,"Achaean name, why have you left the battle to come hither? I fear"
7776,BOOK XIV.,"that what dread Hector said will come true, when he vaunted among"
7777,BOOK XIV.,the Trojans saying that he would not return to Ilius till he had
7778,BOOK XIV.,"fired our ships and killed us; this is what he said, and now it"
7779,BOOK XIV.,"is all coming true. Alas! others of the Achaeans, like Achilles,"
7780,BOOK XIV.,are in such anger with me that they refuse to fight by the sterns
7781,BOOK XIV.,of our ships.”
7782,BOOK XIV.,
7783,BOOK XIV.,"Then Nestor knight of Gerene, answered, “It is indeed as you say;"
7784,BOOK XIV.,"it is all coming true at this moment, and even Jove who thunders"
7785,BOOK XIV.,from on high cannot prevent it. Fallen is the wall on which we
7786,BOOK XIV.,relied as an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet. The
7787,BOOK XIV.,Trojans are fighting stubbornly and without ceasing at the ships;
7788,BOOK XIV.,look where you may you cannot see from what quarter the rout of
7789,BOOK XIV.,the Achaeans is coming; they are being killed in a confused mass
7790,BOOK XIV.,"and the battle-cry ascends to heaven; let us think, if counsel"
7791,BOOK XIV.,"can be of any use, what we had better do; but I do not advise our"
7792,BOOK XIV.,"going into battle ourselves, for a man cannot fight when he is"
7793,BOOK XIV.,wounded.”
7794,BOOK XIV.,
7795,BOOK XIV.,"And King Agamemnon answered, “Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed"
7796,BOOK XIV.,"fighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the"
7797,BOOK XIV.,"trench has served us—over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and"
7798,BOOK XIV.,which they deemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and
7799,BOOK XIV.,our fleet—I see it must be the will of Jove that the Achaeans
7800,BOOK XIV.,"should perish ingloriously here, far from Argos. I knew when Jove"
7801,BOOK XIV.,"was willing to defend us, and I know now that he is raising the"
7802,BOOK XIV.,"Trojans to like honour with the gods, while us, on the other"
7803,BOOK XIV.,"hand, he has bound hand and foot. Now, therefore, let us all do"
7804,BOOK XIV.,as I say; let us bring down the ships that are on the beach and
7805,BOOK XIV.,draw them into the water; let us make them fast to their
7806,BOOK XIV.,"mooring-stones a little way out, against the fall of night—if"
7807,BOOK XIV.,even by night the Trojans will desist from fighting; we may then
7808,BOOK XIV.,draw down the rest of the fleet. There is nothing wrong in flying
7809,BOOK XIV.,ruin even by night. It is better for a man that he should fly and
7810,BOOK XIV.,be saved than be caught and killed.”
7811,BOOK XIV.,
7812,BOOK XIV.,"Ulysses looked fiercely at him and said, “Son of Atreus, what are"
7813,BOOK XIV.,"you talking about? Wretch, you should have commanded some other"
7814,BOOK XIV.,"and baser army, and not been ruler over us to whom Jove has"
7815,BOOK XIV.,"allotted a life of hard fighting from youth to old age, till we"
7816,BOOK XIV.,every one of us perish. Is it thus that you would quit the city
7817,BOOK XIV.,"of Troy, to win which we have suffered so much hardship? Hold"
7818,BOOK XIV.,"your peace, lest some other of the Achaeans hear you say what no"
7819,BOOK XIV.,"man who knows how to give good counsel, no king over so great a"
7820,BOOK XIV.,host as that of the Argives should ever have let fall from his
7821,BOOK XIV.,lips. I despise your judgement utterly for what you have been
7822,BOOK XIV.,"saying. Would you, then, have us draw down our ships into the"
7823,BOOK XIV.,"water while the battle is raging, and thus play further into the"
7824,BOOK XIV.,hands of the conquering Trojans? It would be ruin; the Achaeans
7825,BOOK XIV.,will not go on fighting when they see the ships being drawn into
7826,BOOK XIV.,"the water, but will cease attacking and keep turning their eyes"
7827,BOOK XIV.,"towards them; your counsel, therefore, sir captain, would be our"
7828,BOOK XIV.,destruction.”
7829,BOOK XIV.,
7830,BOOK XIV.,"Agamemnon answered, “Ulysses, your rebuke has stung me to the"
7831,BOOK XIV.,"heart. I am not, however, ordering the Achaeans to draw their"
7832,BOOK XIV.,"ships into the sea whether they will or no. Someone, it may be,"
7833,BOOK XIV.,"old or young, can offer us better counsel which I shall rejoice"
7834,BOOK XIV.,to hear.”
7835,BOOK XIV.,
7836,BOOK XIV.,"Then said Diomed, “Such an one is at hand; he is not far to seek,"
7837,BOOK XIV.,if you will listen to me and not resent my speaking though I am
7838,BOOK XIV.,"younger than any of you. I am by lineage son to a noble sire,"
7839,BOOK XIV.,"Tydeus, who lies buried at Thebes. For Portheus had three noble"
7840,BOOK XIV.,"sons, two of whom, Agrius and Melas, abode in Pleuron and rocky"
7841,BOOK XIV.,"Calydon. The third was the knight Oeneus, my father’s father, and"
7842,BOOK XIV.,he was the most valiant of them all. Oeneus remained in his own
7843,BOOK XIV.,"country, but my father (as Jove and the other gods ordained it)"
7844,BOOK XIV.,"migrated to Argos. He married into the family of Adrastus, and"
7845,BOOK XIV.,"his house was one of great abundance, for he had large estates of"
7846,BOOK XIV.,"rich corn-growing land, with much orchard ground as well, and he"
7847,BOOK XIV.,had many sheep; moreover he excelled all the Argives in the use
7848,BOOK XIV.,of the spear. You must yourselves have heard whether these things
7849,BOOK XIV.,are true or no; therefore when I say well despise not my words as
7850,BOOK XIV.,"though I were a coward or of ignoble birth. I say, then, let us"
7851,BOOK XIV.,"go to the fight as we needs must, wounded though we be. When"
7852,BOOK XIV.,"there, we may keep out of the battle and beyond the range of the"
7853,BOOK XIV.,spears lest we get fresh wounds in addition to what we have
7854,BOOK XIV.,"already, but we can spur on others, who have been indulging their"
7855,BOOK XIV.,spleen and holding aloof from battle hitherto.”
7856,BOOK XIV.,
7857,BOOK XIV.,Thus did he speak; whereon they did even as he had said and set
7858,BOOK XIV.,"out, King Agamemnon leading the way."
7859,BOOK XIV.,
7860,BOOK XIV.,"Meanwhile Neptune had kept no blind look-out, and came up to them"
7861,BOOK XIV.,in the semblance of an old man. He took Agamemnon’s right hand in
7862,BOOK XIV.,"his own and said, “Son of Atreus, I take it Achilles is glad now"
7863,BOOK XIV.,"that he sees the Achaeans routed and slain, for he is utterly"
7864,BOOK XIV.,without remorse—may he come to a bad end and heaven confound him.
7865,BOOK XIV.,"As for yourself, the blessed gods are not yet so bitterly angry"
7866,BOOK XIV.,with you but that the princes and counsellors of the Trojans
7867,BOOK XIV.,"shall again raise the dust upon the plain, and you shall see them"
7868,BOOK XIV.,flying from the ships and tents towards their city.”
7869,BOOK XIV.,
7870,BOOK XIV.,"With this he raised a mighty cry of battle, and sped forward to"
7871,BOOK XIV.,the plain. The voice that came from his deep chest was as that of
7872,BOOK XIV.,nine or ten thousand men when they are shouting in the thick of a
7873,BOOK XIV.,"fight, and it put fresh courage into the hearts of the Achaeans"
7874,BOOK XIV.,to wage war and do battle without ceasing.
7875,BOOK XIV.,
7876,BOOK XIV.,Juno of the golden throne looked down as she stood upon a peak of
7877,BOOK XIV.,Olympus and her heart was gladdened at the sight of him who was
7878,BOOK XIV.,"at once her brother and her brother-in-law, hurrying hither and"
7879,BOOK XIV.,thither amid the fighting. Then she turned her eyes to Jove as he
7880,BOOK XIV.,"sat on the topmost crests of many-fountained Ida, and loathed"
7881,BOOK XIV.,"him. She set herself to think how she might hoodwink him, and in"
7882,BOOK XIV.,the end she deemed that it would be best for her to go to Ida and
7883,BOOK XIV.,"array herself in rich attire, in the hope that Jove might become"
7884,BOOK XIV.,"enamoured of her, and wish to embrace her. While he was thus"
7885,BOOK XIV.,engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be made to steal over
7886,BOOK XIV.,his eyes and senses.
7887,BOOK XIV.,
7888,BOOK XIV.,"She went, therefore, to the room which her son Vulcan had made"
7889,BOOK XIV.,"her, and the doors of which he had cunningly fastened by means of"
7890,BOOK XIV.,a secret key so that no other god could open them. Here she
7891,BOOK XIV.,entered and closed the doors behind her. She cleansed all the
7892,BOOK XIV.,"dirt from her fair body with ambrosia, then she anointed herself"
7893,BOOK XIV.,"with olive oil, ambrosial, very soft, and scented specially for"
7894,BOOK XIV.,herself—if it were so much as shaken in the bronze-floored house
7895,BOOK XIV.,"of Jove, the scent pervaded the universe of heaven and earth."
7896,BOOK XIV.,"With this she anointed her delicate skin, and then she plaited"
7897,BOOK XIV.,the fair ambrosial locks that flowed in a stream of golden
7898,BOOK XIV.,tresses from her immortal head. She put on the wondrous robe
7899,BOOK XIV.,"which Minerva had worked for her with consummate art, and had"
7900,BOOK XIV.,embroidered with manifold devices; she fastened it about her
7901,BOOK XIV.,"bosom with golden clasps, and she girded herself with a girdle"
7902,BOOK XIV.,"that had a hundred tassels: then she fastened her earrings, three"
7903,BOOK XIV.,"brilliant pendants that glistened most beautifully, through the"
7904,BOOK XIV.,"pierced lobes of her ears, and threw a lovely new veil over her"
7905,BOOK XIV.,"head. She bound her sandals on to her feet, and when she had"
7906,BOOK XIV.,"arrayed herself perfectly to her satisfaction, she left her room"
7907,BOOK XIV.,"and called Venus to come aside and speak to her. “My dear child,”"
7908,BOOK XIV.,"said she, “will you do what I am going to ask of you, or will you"
7909,BOOK XIV.,"refuse me because you are angry at my being on the Danaan side,"
7910,BOOK XIV.,while you are on the Trojan?”
7911,BOOK XIV.,
7912,BOOK XIV.,"Jove’s daughter Venus answered, “Juno, august queen of goddesses,"
7913,BOOK XIV.,"daughter of mighty Saturn, say what you want, and I will do it"
7914,BOOK XIV.,"for you at once, if I can, and if it can be done at all.”"
7915,BOOK XIV.,
7916,BOOK XIV.,"Then Juno told her a lying tale and said, “I want you to endow me"
7917,BOOK XIV.,"with some of those fascinating charms, the spells of which bring"
7918,BOOK XIV.,all things mortal and immortal to your feet. I am going to the
7919,BOOK XIV.,world’s end to visit Oceanus (from whom all we gods proceed) and
7920,BOOK XIV.,"mother Tethys: they received me in their house, took care of me,"
7921,BOOK XIV.,"and brought me up, having taken me over from Rhaea when Jove"
7922,BOOK XIV.,imprisoned great Saturn in the depths that are under earth and
7923,BOOK XIV.,sea. I must go and see them that I may make peace between them;
7924,BOOK XIV.,"they have been quarrelling, and are so angry that they have not"
7925,BOOK XIV.,slept with one another this long while; if I can bring them round
7926,BOOK XIV.,"and restore them to one another’s embraces, they will be grateful"
7927,BOOK XIV.,to me and love me for ever afterwards.”
7928,BOOK XIV.,
7929,BOOK XIV.,"Thereon laughter-loving Venus said, “I cannot and must not refuse"
7930,BOOK XIV.,"you, for you sleep in the arms of Jove who is our king.”"
7931,BOOK XIV.,
7932,BOOK XIV.,As she spoke she loosed from her bosom the curiously embroidered
7933,BOOK XIV.,"girdle into which all her charms had been wrought—love, desire,"
7934,BOOK XIV.,and that sweet flattery which steals the judgement even of the
7935,BOOK XIV.,"most prudent. She gave the girdle to Juno and said, “Take this"
7936,BOOK XIV.,girdle wherein all my charms reside and lay it in your bosom. If
7937,BOOK XIV.,"you will wear it I promise you that your errand, be it what it"
7938,BOOK XIV.,"may, will not be bootless.”"
7939,BOOK XIV.,
7940,BOOK XIV.,"When she heard this Juno smiled, and still smiling she laid the"
7941,BOOK XIV.,girdle in her bosom.
7942,BOOK XIV.,
7943,BOOK XIV.,"Venus now went back into the house of Jove, while Juno darted"
7944,BOOK XIV.,down from the summits of Olympus. She passed over Pieria and fair
7945,BOOK XIV.,"Emathia, and went on and on till she came to the snowy ranges of"
7946,BOOK XIV.,"the Thracian horsemen, over whose topmost crests she sped without"
7947,BOOK XIV.,ever setting foot to ground. When she came to Athos she went on
7948,BOOK XIV.,"over the waves of the sea till she reached Lemnos, the city of"
7949,BOOK XIV.,"noble Thoas. There she met Sleep, own brother to Death, and"
7950,BOOK XIV.,"caught him by the hand, saying, “Sleep, you who lord it alike"
7951,BOOK XIV.,"over mortals and immortals, if you ever did me a service in times"
7952,BOOK XIV.,"past, do one for me now, and I shall be grateful to you ever"
7953,BOOK XIV.,after. Close Jove’s keen eyes for me in slumber while I hold him
7954,BOOK XIV.,"clasped in my embrace, and I will give you a beautiful golden"
7955,BOOK XIV.,"seat, that can never fall to pieces; my clubfooted son Vulcan"
7956,BOOK XIV.,"shall make it for you, and he shall give it a footstool for you"
7957,BOOK XIV.,to rest your fair feet upon when you are at table.”
7958,BOOK XIV.,
7959,BOOK XIV.,"Then Sleep answered, “Juno, great queen of goddesses, daughter of"
7960,BOOK XIV.,"mighty Saturn, I would lull any other of the gods to sleep"
7961,BOOK XIV.,"without compunction, not even excepting the waters of Oceanus"
7962,BOOK XIV.,"from whom all of them proceed, but I dare not go near Jove, nor"
7963,BOOK XIV.,send him to sleep unless he bids me. I have had one lesson
7964,BOOK XIV.,"already through doing what you asked me, on the day when Jove’s"
7965,BOOK XIV.,mighty son Hercules set sail from Ilius after having sacked the
7966,BOOK XIV.,city of the Trojans. At your bidding I suffused my sweet self
7967,BOOK XIV.,"over the mind of aegis-bearing Jove, and laid him to rest;"
7968,BOOK XIV.,"meanwhile you hatched a plot against Hercules, and set the blasts"
7969,BOOK XIV.,"of the angry winds beating upon the sea, till you took him to the"
7970,BOOK XIV.,"goodly city of Cos, away from all his friends. Jove was furious"
7971,BOOK XIV.,"when he awoke, and began hurling the gods about all over the"
7972,BOOK XIV.,"house; he was looking more particularly for myself, and would"
7973,BOOK XIV.,have flung me down through space into the sea where I should
7974,BOOK XIV.,"never have been heard of any more, had not Night who cows both"
7975,BOOK XIV.,men and gods protected me. I fled to her and Jove left off
7976,BOOK XIV.,"looking for me in spite of his being so angry, for he did not"
7977,BOOK XIV.,dare do anything to displease Night. And now you are again asking
7978,BOOK XIV.,me to do something on which I cannot venture.”
7979,BOOK XIV.,
7980,BOOK XIV.,"And Juno said, “Sleep, why do you take such notions as those into"
7981,BOOK XIV.,your head? Do you think Jove will be as anxious to help the
7982,BOOK XIV.,"Trojans, as he was about his own son? Come, I will marry you to"
7983,BOOK XIV.,"one of the youngest of the Graces, and she shall be your"
7984,BOOK XIV.,"own—Pasithea, whom you have always wanted to marry.”"
7985,BOOK XIV.,
7986,BOOK XIV.,"Sleep was pleased when he heard this, and answered, “Then swear"
7987,BOOK XIV.,it to me by the dread waters of the river Styx; lay one hand on
7988,BOOK XIV.,"the bounteous earth, and the other on the sheen of the sea, so"
7989,BOOK XIV.,that all the gods who dwell down below with Saturn may be our
7990,BOOK XIV.,"witnesses, and see that you really do give me one of the youngest"
7991,BOOK XIV.,"of the Graces—Pasithea, whom I have always wanted to marry.”"
7992,BOOK XIV.,
7993,BOOK XIV.,"Juno did as he had said. She swore, and invoked all the gods of"
7994,BOOK XIV.,"the nether world, who are called Titans, to witness. When she had"
7995,BOOK XIV.,"completed her oath, the two enshrouded themselves in a thick mist"
7996,BOOK XIV.,"and sped lightly forward, leaving Lemnos and Imbrus behind them."
7997,BOOK XIV.,"Presently they reached many-fountained Ida, mother of wild"
7998,BOOK XIV.,"beasts, and Lectum where they left the sea to go on by land, and"
7999,BOOK XIV.,the tops of the trees of the forest soughed under the going of
8000,BOOK XIV.,"their feet. Here Sleep halted, and ere Jove caught sight of him"
8001,BOOK XIV.,he climbed a lofty pine-tree—the tallest that reared its head
8002,BOOK XIV.,towards heaven on all Ida. He hid himself behind the branches and
8003,BOOK XIV.,sat there in the semblance of the sweet-singing bird that haunts
8004,BOOK XIV.,"the mountains and is called Chalcis by the gods, but men call it"
8005,BOOK XIV.,"Cymindis. Juno then went to Gargarus, the topmost peak of Ida,"
8006,BOOK XIV.,"and Jove, driver of the clouds, set eyes upon her. As soon as he"
8007,BOOK XIV.,did so he became inflamed with the same passionate desire for her
8008,BOOK XIV.,that he had felt when they had first enjoyed each other’s
8009,BOOK XIV.,"embraces, and slept with one another without their dear parents"
8010,BOOK XIV.,"knowing anything about it. He went up to her and said, “What do"
8011,BOOK XIV.,you want that you have come hither from Olympus—and that too with
8012,BOOK XIV.,neither chariot nor horses to convey you?”
8013,BOOK XIV.,
8014,BOOK XIV.,"Then Juno told him a lying tale and said, “I am going to the"
8015,BOOK XIV.,"world’s end, to visit Oceanus, from whom all we gods proceed, and"
8016,BOOK XIV.,"mother Tethys; they received me into their house, took care of"
8017,BOOK XIV.,"me, and brought me up. I must go and see them that I may make"
8018,BOOK XIV.,"peace between them: they have been quarrelling, and are so angry"
8019,BOOK XIV.,that they have not slept with one another this long time. The
8020,BOOK XIV.,horses that will take me over land and sea are stationed on the
8021,BOOK XIV.,"lowermost spurs of many-fountained Ida, and I have come here from"
8022,BOOK XIV.,Olympus on purpose to consult you. I was afraid you might be
8023,BOOK XIV.,"angry with me later on, if I went to the house of Oceanus without"
8024,BOOK XIV.,letting you know.”
8025,BOOK XIV.,
8026,BOOK XIV.,"And Jove said, “Juno, you can choose some other time for paying"
8027,BOOK XIV.,your visit to Oceanus—for the present let us devote ourselves to
8028,BOOK XIV.,love and to the enjoyment of one another. Never yet have I been
8029,BOOK XIV.,so overpowered by passion neither for goddess nor mortal woman as
8030,BOOK XIV.,I am at this moment for yourself—not even when I was in love with
8031,BOOK XIV.,"the wife of Ixion who bore me Pirithous, peer of gods in counsel,"
8032,BOOK XIV.,"nor yet with Danae the daintily-ancled daughter of Acrisius, who"
8033,BOOK XIV.,bore me the famed hero Perseus. Then there was the daughter of
8034,BOOK XIV.,"Phoenix, who bore me Minos and Rhadamanthus: there was Semele,"
8035,BOOK XIV.,and Alcmena in Thebes by whom I begot my lion-hearted son
8036,BOOK XIV.,"Hercules, while Semele became mother to Bacchus the comforter of"
8037,BOOK XIV.,"mankind. There was queen Ceres again, and lovely Leto, and"
8038,BOOK XIV.,yourself—but with none of these was I ever so much enamoured as I
8039,BOOK XIV.,now am with you.”
8040,BOOK XIV.,
8041,BOOK XIV.,Juno again answered him with a lying tale. “Most dread son of
8042,BOOK XIV.,"Saturn,” she exclaimed, “what are you talking about? Would you"
8043,BOOK XIV.,"have us enjoy one another here on the top of Mount Ida, where"
8044,BOOK XIV.,everything can be seen? What if one of the ever-living gods
8045,BOOK XIV.,"should see us sleeping together, and tell the others? It would be"
8046,BOOK XIV.,such a scandal that when I had risen from your embraces I could
8047,BOOK XIV.,never show myself inside your house again; but if you are so
8048,BOOK XIV.,"minded, there is a room which your son Vulcan has made me, and he"
8049,BOOK XIV.,"has given it good strong doors; if you would so have it, let us"
8050,BOOK XIV.,go thither and lie down.”
8051,BOOK XIV.,
8052,BOOK XIV.,"And Jove answered, “Juno, you need not be afraid that either god"
8053,BOOK XIV.,"or man will see you, for I will enshroud both of us in such a"
8054,BOOK XIV.,"dense golden cloud, that the very sun for all his bright piercing"
8055,BOOK XIV.,beams shall not see through it.”
8056,BOOK XIV.,
8057,BOOK XIV.,With this the son of Saturn caught his wife in his embrace;
8058,BOOK XIV.,"whereon the earth sprouted them a cushion of young grass, with"
8059,BOOK XIV.,"dew-bespangled lotus, crocus, and hyacinth, so soft and thick"
8060,BOOK XIV.,that it raised them well above the ground. Here they laid
8061,BOOK XIV.,themselves down and overhead they were covered by a fair cloud of
8062,BOOK XIV.,"gold, from which there fell glittering dew-drops."
8063,BOOK XIV.,
8064,BOOK XIV.,"Thus, then, did the sire of all things repose peacefully on the"
8065,BOOK XIV.,"crest of Ida, overcome at once by sleep and love, and he held his"
8066,BOOK XIV.,spouse in his arms. Meanwhile Sleep made off to the ships of the
8067,BOOK XIV.,"Achaeans, to tell earth-encircling Neptune, lord of the"
8068,BOOK XIV.,"earthquake. When he had found him he said, “Now, Neptune, you can"
8069,BOOK XIV.,"help the Danaans with a will, and give them victory though it be"
8070,BOOK XIV.,only for a short time while Jove is still sleeping. I have sent
8071,BOOK XIV.,"him into a sweet slumber, and Juno has beguiled him into going to"
8072,BOOK XIV.,bed with her.”
8073,BOOK XIV.,
8074,BOOK XIV.,"Sleep now departed and went his ways to and fro among mankind,"
8075,BOOK XIV.,leaving Neptune more eager than ever to help the Danaans. He
8076,BOOK XIV.,"darted forward among the first ranks and shouted saying,"
8077,BOOK XIV.,"“Argives, shall we let Hector son of Priam have the triumph of"
8078,BOOK XIV.,taking our ships and covering himself with glory? This is what he
8079,BOOK XIV.,"says that he shall now do, seeing that Achilles is still in"
8080,BOOK XIV.,dudgeon at his ship; we shall get on very well without him if we
8081,BOOK XIV.,"keep each other in heart and stand by one another. Now,"
8082,BOOK XIV.,"therefore, let us all do as I say. Let us each take the best and"
8083,BOOK XIV.,"largest shield we can lay hold of, put on our helmets, and sally"
8084,BOOK XIV.,"forth with our longest spears in our hands; I will lead you on,"
8085,BOOK XIV.,"and Hector son of Priam, rage as he may, will not dare to hold"
8086,BOOK XIV.,out against us. If any good staunch soldier has only a small
8087,BOOK XIV.,"shield, let him hand it over to a worse man, and take a larger"
8088,BOOK XIV.,one for himself.”
8089,BOOK XIV.,
8090,BOOK XIV.,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. The son of"
8091,BOOK XIV.,"Tydeus, Ulysses, and Agamemnon, wounded though they were, set the"
8092,BOOK XIV.,"others in array, and went about everywhere effecting the"
8093,BOOK XIV.,"exchanges of armour; the most valiant took the best armour, and"
8094,BOOK XIV.,gave the worse to the worse man. When they had donned their
8095,BOOK XIV.,bronze armour they marched on with Neptune at their head. In his
8096,BOOK XIV.,"strong hand he grasped his terrible sword, keen of edge and"
8097,BOOK XIV.,flashing like lightning; woe to him who comes across it in the
8098,BOOK XIV.,day of battle; all men quake for fear and keep away from it.
8099,BOOK XIV.,
8100,BOOK XIV.,Hector on the other side set the Trojans in array. Thereon
8101,BOOK XIV.,Neptune and Hector waged fierce war on one another—Hector on the
8102,BOOK XIV.,Trojan and Neptune on the Argive side. Mighty was the uproar as
8103,BOOK XIV.,the two forces met; the sea came rolling in towards the ships and
8104,BOOK XIV.,"tents of the Achaeans, but waves do not thunder on the shore more"
8105,BOOK XIV.,"loudly when driven before the blast of Boreas, nor do the flames"
8106,BOOK XIV.,of a forest fire roar more fiercely when it is well alight upon
8107,BOOK XIV.,"the mountains, nor does the wind bellow with ruder music as it"
8108,BOOK XIV.,"tears on through the tops of when it is blowing its hardest, than"
8109,BOOK XIV.,the terrible shout which the Trojans and Achaeans raised as they
8110,BOOK XIV.,sprang upon one another.
8111,BOOK XIV.,
8112,BOOK XIV.,"Hector first aimed his spear at Ajax, who was turned full towards"
8113,BOOK XIV.,"him, nor did he miss his aim. The spear struck him where two"
8114,BOOK XIV.,bands passed over his chest—the band of his shield and that of
8115,BOOK XIV.,his silver-studded sword—and these protected his body. Hector was
8116,BOOK XIV.,"angry that his spear should have been hurled in vain, and"
8117,BOOK XIV.,"withdrew under cover of his men. As he was thus retreating, Ajax"
8118,BOOK XIV.,"son of Telamon, struck him with a stone, of which there were many"
8119,BOOK XIV.,lying about under the men’s feet as they fought—brought there to
8120,BOOK XIV.,give support to the ships’ sides as they lay on the shore. Ajax
8121,BOOK XIV.,caught up one of them and struck Hector above the rim of his
8122,BOOK XIV.,shield close to his neck; the blow made him spin round like a top
8123,BOOK XIV.,and reel in all directions. As an oak falls headlong when
8124,BOOK XIV.,"uprooted by the lightning flash of father Jove, and there is a"
8125,BOOK XIV.,terrible smell of brimstone—no man can help being dismayed if he
8126,BOOK XIV.,"is standing near it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful thing—even"
8127,BOOK XIV.,so did Hector fall to earth and bite the dust. His spear fell
8128,BOOK XIV.,"from his hand, but his shield and helmet were made fast about his"
8129,BOOK XIV.,"body, and his bronze armour rang about him."
8130,BOOK XIV.,
8131,BOOK XIV.,The sons of the Achaeans came running with a loud cry towards
8132,BOOK XIV.,"him, hoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on"
8133,BOOK XIV.,"the Trojans, but none of them could wound him before he was"
8134,BOOK XIV.,"surrounded and covered by the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor,"
8135,BOOK XIV.,"Sarpedon captain of the Lycians, and noble Glaucus. Of the"
8136,BOOK XIV.,"others, too, there was not one who was unmindful of him, and they"
8137,BOOK XIV.,held their round shields over him to cover him. His comrades then
8138,BOOK XIV.,lifted him off the ground and bore him away from the battle to
8139,BOOK XIV.,the place where his horses stood waiting for him at the rear of
8140,BOOK XIV.,the fight with their driver and the chariot; these then took him
8141,BOOK XIV.,towards the city groaning and in great pain. When they reached
8142,BOOK XIV.,"the ford of the fair stream of Xanthus, begotten of Immortal"
8143,BOOK XIV.,"Jove, they took him from off his chariot and laid him down on the"
8144,BOOK XIV.,"ground; they poured water over him, and as they did so he"
8145,BOOK XIV.,breathed again and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees he
8146,BOOK XIV.,"vomited blood, but soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes"
8147,BOOK XIV.,were again closed in darkness for he was still stunned by the
8148,BOOK XIV.,blow.
8149,BOOK XIV.,
8150,BOOK XIV.,"When the Argives saw Hector leaving the field, they took heart"
8151,BOOK XIV.,and set upon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of
8152,BOOK XIV.,"Oileus began by springing on Satnius son of Enops, and wounding"
8153,BOOK XIV.,him with his spear: a fair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops as
8154,BOOK XIV.,he was herding cattle by the banks of the river Satnioeis. The
8155,BOOK XIV.,son of Oileus came up to him and struck him in the flank so that
8156,BOOK XIV.,"he fell, and a fierce fight between Trojans and Danaans raged"
8157,BOOK XIV.,round his body. Polydamas son of Panthous drew near to avenge
8158,BOOK XIV.,"him, and wounded Prothoenor son of Areilycus on the right"
8159,BOOK XIV.,"shoulder; the terrible spear went right through his shoulder, and"
8160,BOOK XIV.,he clutched the earth as he fell in the dust. Polydamas vaunted
8161,BOOK XIV.,"loudly over him saying, “Again I take it that the spear has not"
8162,BOOK XIV.,sped in vain from the strong hand of the son of Panthous; an
8163,BOOK XIV.,"Argive has caught it in his body, and it will serve him for a"
8164,BOOK XIV.,staff as he goes down into the house of Hades.”
8165,BOOK XIV.,
8166,BOOK XIV.,The Argives were maddened by this boasting. Ajax son of Telamon
8167,BOOK XIV.,"was more angry than any, for the man had fallen close beside him;"
8168,BOOK XIV.,"so he aimed at Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas"
8169,BOOK XIV.,saved himself by swerving aside and the spear struck Archelochus
8170,BOOK XIV.,"son of Antenor, for heaven counselled his destruction; it struck"
8171,BOOK XIV.,him where the head springs from the neck at the top joint of the
8172,BOOK XIV.,"spine, and severed both the tendons at the back of the head. His"
8173,BOOK XIV.,"head, mouth, and nostrils reached the ground long before his legs"
8174,BOOK XIV.,"and knees could do so, and Ajax shouted to Polydamas saying,"
8175,BOOK XIV.,"“Think, Polydamas, and tell me truly whether this man is not as"
8176,BOOK XIV.,"well worth killing as Prothoenor was: he seems rich, and of rich"
8177,BOOK XIV.,"family, a brother, it may be, or son of the knight Antenor, for"
8178,BOOK XIV.,he is very like him.”
8179,BOOK XIV.,
8180,BOOK XIV.,"But he knew well who it was, and the Trojans were greatly"
8181,BOOK XIV.,angered. Acamas then bestrode his brother’s body and wounded
8182,BOOK XIV.,"Promachus the Boeotian with his spear, for he was trying to drag"
8183,BOOK XIV.,"his brother’s body away. Acamas vaunted loudly over him saying,"
8184,BOOK XIV.,"“Argive archers, braggarts that you are, toil and suffering shall"
8185,BOOK XIV.,"not be for us only, but some of you too shall fall here as well"
8186,BOOK XIV.,"as ourselves. See how Promachus now sleeps, vanquished by my"
8187,BOOK XIV.,spear; payment for my brother’s blood has not been long delayed;
8188,BOOK XIV.,"a man, therefore, may well be thankful if he leaves a kinsman in"
8189,BOOK XIV.,his house behind him to avenge his fall.”
8190,BOOK XIV.,
8191,BOOK XIV.,"His taunts infuriated the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged"
8192,BOOK XIV.,"than any of them. He sprang towards Acamas, but Acamas did not"
8193,BOOK XIV.,"stand his ground, and he killed Ilioneus son of the rich"
8194,BOOK XIV.,"flock-master Phorbas, whom Mercury had favoured and endowed with"
8195,BOOK XIV.,greater wealth than any other of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his
8196,BOOK XIV.,"only son, and Peneleos now wounded him in the eye under his"
8197,BOOK XIV.,"eyebrows, tearing the eye-ball from its socket: the spear went"
8198,BOOK XIV.,"right through the eye into the nape of the neck, and he fell,"
8199,BOOK XIV.,stretching out both hands before him. Peneleos then drew his
8200,BOOK XIV.,"sword and smote him on the neck, so that both head and helmet"
8201,BOOK XIV.,came tumbling down to the ground with the spear still sticking in
8202,BOOK XIV.,"the eye; he then held up the head, as though it had been a"
8203,BOOK XIV.,"poppy-head, and showed it to the Trojans, vaunting over them as"
8204,BOOK XIV.,"he did so. “Trojans,” he cried, “bid the father and mother of"
8205,BOOK XIV.,"noble Ilioneus make moan for him in their house, for the wife"
8206,BOOK XIV.,also of Promachus son of Alegenor will never be gladdened by the
8207,BOOK XIV.,coming of her dear husband—when we Argives return with our ships
8208,BOOK XIV.,from Troy.”
8209,BOOK XIV.,
8210,BOOK XIV.,"As he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man looked round about"
8211,BOOK XIV.,to see whither he might fly for safety.
8212,BOOK XIV.,
8213,BOOK XIV.,"Tell me now, O Muses that dwell on Olympus, who was the first of"
8214,BOOK XIV.,the Argives to bear away blood-stained spoils after Neptune lord
8215,BOOK XIV.,of the earthquake had turned the fortune of war. Ajax son of
8216,BOOK XIV.,"Telamon was first to wound Hyrtius son of Gyrtius, captain of the"
8217,BOOK XIV.,"staunch Mysians. Antilochus killed Phalces and Mermerus, while"
8218,BOOK XIV.,"Meriones slew Morys and Hippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon"
8219,BOOK XIV.,and Periphetes. The son of Atreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd
8220,BOOK XIV.,"of his people, in the flank, and the bronze point made his"
8221,BOOK XIV.,entrails gush out as it tore in among them; on this his life came
8222,BOOK XIV.,"hurrying out of him at the place where he had been wounded, and"
8223,BOOK XIV.,his eyes were closed in darkness. Ajax son of Oileus killed more
8224,BOOK XIV.,"than any other, for there was no man so fleet as he to pursue"
8225,BOOK XIV.,flying foes when Jove had spread panic among them.
8226,BOOK XIV.,
8227,BOOK XIV.,
8228,BOOK XIV.,
8229,BOOK XIV.,
8230,BOOK XV.,BOOK XV.
8231,BOOK XV.,
8232,BOOK XV.,
8233,BOOK XV.,"Jove awakes, tells Apollo to heal Hector, and the Trojans again"
8234,BOOK XV.,become victorious.
8235,BOOK XV.,
8236,BOOK XV.,But when their flight had taken them past the trench and the set
8237,BOOK XV.,"stakes, and many had fallen by the hands of the Danaans, the"
8238,BOOK XV.,"Trojans made a halt on reaching their chariots, routed and pale"
8239,BOOK XV.,"with fear. Jove now woke on the crests of Ida, where he was lying"
8240,BOOK XV.,"with golden-throned Juno by his side, and starting to his feet he"
8241,BOOK XV.,"saw the Trojans and Achaeans, the one thrown into confusion, and"
8242,BOOK XV.,the others driving them pell-mell before them with King Neptune
8243,BOOK XV.,in their midst. He saw Hector lying on the ground with his
8244,BOOK XV.,"comrades gathered round him, gasping for breath, wandering in"
8245,BOOK XV.,"mind and vomiting blood, for it was not the feeblest of the"
8246,BOOK XV.,Achaeans who struck him.
8247,BOOK XV.,
8248,BOOK XV.,"The sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on"
8249,BOOK XV.,"Juno. “I see, Juno,” said he, “you mischief-making trickster,"
8250,BOOK XV.,that your cunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused
8251,BOOK XV.,"the rout of his host. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in which"
8252,BOOK XV.,case you will be the first to reap the fruits of your scurvy
8253,BOOK XV.,knavery. Do you not remember how once upon a time I had you
8254,BOOK XV.,"hanged? I fastened two anvils on to your feet, and bound your"
8255,BOOK XV.,"hands in a chain of gold which none might break, and you hung in"
8256,BOOK XV.,"mid-air among the clouds. All the gods in Olympus were in a fury,"
8257,BOOK XV.,but they could not reach you to set you free; when I caught any
8258,BOOK XV.,one of them I gripped him and hurled him from the heavenly
8259,BOOK XV.,threshold till he came fainting down to earth; yet even this did
8260,BOOK XV.,not relieve my mind from the incessant anxiety which I felt about
8261,BOOK XV.,noble Hercules whom you and Boreas had spitefully conveyed beyond
8262,BOOK XV.,"the seas to Cos, after suborning the tempests; but I rescued him,"
8263,BOOK XV.,and notwithstanding all his mighty labours I brought him back
8264,BOOK XV.,again to Argos. I would remind you of this that you may learn to
8265,BOOK XV.,"leave off being so deceitful, and discover how much you are"
8266,BOOK XV.,likely to gain by the embraces out of which you have come here to
8267,BOOK XV.,trick me.”
8268,BOOK XV.,
8269,BOOK XV.,"Juno trembled as he spoke, and said, “May heaven above and earth"
8270,BOOK XV.,"below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx—and this"
8271,BOOK XV.,"is the most solemn oath that a blessed god can take—nay, I swear"
8272,BOOK XV.,also by your own almighty head and by our bridal bed—things over
8273,BOOK XV.,which I could never possibly perjure myself—that Neptune is not
8274,BOOK XV.,punishing Hector and the Trojans and helping the Achaeans through
8275,BOOK XV.,any doing of mine; it is all of his own mere motion because he
8276,BOOK XV.,was sorry to see the Achaeans hard pressed at their ships: if I
8277,BOOK XV.,"were advising him, I should tell him to do as you bid him.”"
8278,BOOK XV.,
8279,BOOK XV.,"The sire of gods and men smiled and answered, “If you, Juno, were"
8280,BOOK XV.,"always to support me when we sit in council of the gods, Neptune,"
8281,BOOK XV.,"like it or no, would soon come round to your and my way of"
8282,BOOK XV.,"thinking. If, then, you are speaking the truth and mean what you"
8283,BOOK XV.,"say, go among the rank and file of the gods, and tell Iris and"
8284,BOOK XV.,"Apollo lord of the bow, that I want them—Iris, that she may go to"
8285,BOOK XV.,the Achaean host and tell Neptune to leave off fighting and go
8286,BOOK XV.,"home, and Apollo, that he may send Hector again into battle and"
8287,BOOK XV.,give him fresh strength; he will thus forget his present
8288,BOOK XV.,"sufferings, and drive the Achaeans back in confusion till they"
8289,BOOK XV.,fall among the ships of Achilles son of Peleus. Achilles will
8290,BOOK XV.,"then send his comrade Patroclus into battle, and Hector will kill"
8291,BOOK XV.,"him in front of Ilius after he has slain many warriors, and among"
8292,BOOK XV.,them my own noble son Sarpedon. Achilles will kill Hector to
8293,BOOK XV.,"avenge Patroclus, and from that time I will bring it about that"
8294,BOOK XV.,the Achaeans shall persistently drive the Trojans back till they
8295,BOOK XV.,fulfil the counsels of Minerva and take Ilius. But I will not
8296,BOOK XV.,"stay my anger, nor permit any god to help the Danaans till I have"
8297,BOOK XV.,"accomplished the desire of the son of Peleus, according to the"
8298,BOOK XV.,promise I made by bowing my head on the day when Thetis touched
8299,BOOK XV.,my knees and besought me to give him honour.”
8300,BOOK XV.,
8301,BOOK XV.,Juno heeded his words and went from the heights of Ida to great
8302,BOOK XV.,Olympus. Swift as the thought of one whose fancy carries him over
8303,BOOK XV.,"vast continents, and he says to himself, “Now I will be here, or"
8304,BOOK XV.,"there,” and he would have all manner of things—even so swiftly"
8305,BOOK XV.,did Juno wing her way till she came to high Olympus and went in
8306,BOOK XV.,among the gods who were gathered in the house of Jove. When they
8307,BOOK XV.,"saw her they all of them came up to her, and held out their cups"
8308,BOOK XV.,"to her by way of greeting. She let the others be, but took the"
8309,BOOK XV.,"cup offered her by lovely Themis, who was first to come running"
8310,BOOK XV.,"up to her. “Juno,” said she, “why are you here? And you seem"
8311,BOOK XV.,troubled—has your husband the son of Saturn been frightening
8312,BOOK XV.,you?”
8313,BOOK XV.,
8314,BOOK XV.,"And Juno answered, “Themis, do not ask me about it. You know what"
8315,BOOK XV.,a proud and cruel disposition my husband has. Lead the gods to
8316,BOOK XV.,"table, where you and all the immortals can hear the wicked"
8317,BOOK XV.,"designs which he has avowed. Many a one, mortal and immortal,"
8318,BOOK XV.,"will be angered by them, however peaceably he may be feasting"
8319,BOOK XV.,now.”
8320,BOOK XV.,
8321,BOOK XV.,"On this Juno sat down, and the gods were troubled throughout the"
8322,BOOK XV.,house of Jove. Laughter sat on her lips but her brow was furrowed
8323,BOOK XV.,"with care, and she spoke up in a rage. “Fools that we are,” she"
8324,BOOK XV.,"cried, “to be thus madly angry with Jove; we keep on wanting to"
8325,BOOK XV.,"go up to him and stay him by force or by persuasion, but he sits"
8326,BOOK XV.,"aloof and cares for nobody, for he knows that he is much stronger"
8327,BOOK XV.,"than any other of the immortals. Make the best, therefore, of"
8328,BOOK XV.,"whatever ills he may choose to send each one of you; Mars, I take"
8329,BOOK XV.,"it, has had a taste of them already, for his son Ascalaphus has"
8330,BOOK XV.,fallen in battle—the man whom of all others he loved most dearly
8331,BOOK XV.,and whose father he owns himself to be.”
8332,BOOK XV.,
8333,BOOK XV.,When he heard this Mars smote his two sturdy thighs with the flat
8334,BOOK XV.,"of his hands, and said in anger, “Do not blame me, you gods that"
8335,BOOK XV.,"dwell in heaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and avenge"
8336,BOOK XV.,"the death of my son, even though it end in my being struck by"
8337,BOOK XV.,Jove’s lightning and lying in blood and dust among the corpses.”
8338,BOOK XV.,
8339,BOOK XV.,"As he spoke he gave orders to yoke his horses Panic and Rout,"
8340,BOOK XV.,"while he put on his armour. On this, Jove would have been roused"
8341,BOOK XV.,to still more fierce and implacable enmity against the other
8342,BOOK XV.,"immortals, had not Minerva, alarmed for the safety of the gods,"
8343,BOOK XV.,sprung from her seat and hurried outside. She tore the helmet
8344,BOOK XV.,"from his head and the shield from his shoulders, and she took the"
8345,BOOK XV.,bronze spear from his strong hand and set it on one side; then
8346,BOOK XV.,"she said to Mars, “Madman, you are undone; you have ears that"
8347,BOOK XV.,"hear not, or you have lost all judgement and understanding; have"
8348,BOOK XV.,you not heard what Juno has said on coming straight from the
8349,BOOK XV.,presence of Olympian Jove? Do you wish to go through all kinds of
8350,BOOK XV.,"suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry to Olympus,"
8351,BOOK XV.,after having caused infinite mischief to all us others? Jove
8352,BOOK XV.,would instantly leave the Trojans and Achaeans to themselves; he
8353,BOOK XV.,"would come to Olympus to punish us, and would grip us up one"
8354,BOOK XV.,"after another, guilty or not guilty. Therefore lay aside your"
8355,BOOK XV.,anger for the death of your son; better men than he have either
8356,BOOK XV.,"been killed already or will fall hereafter, and one cannot"
8357,BOOK XV.,protect every one’s whole family.”
8358,BOOK XV.,
8359,BOOK XV.,With these words she took Mars back to his seat. Meanwhile Juno
8360,BOOK XV.,"called Apollo outside, with Iris the messenger of the gods."
8361,BOOK XV.,"“Jove,” she said to them, “desires you to go to him at once on"
8362,BOOK XV.,Mt. Ida; when you have seen him you are to do as he may then bid
8363,BOOK XV.,you.”
8364,BOOK XV.,
8365,BOOK XV.,"Thereon Juno left them and resumed her seat inside, while Iris"
8366,BOOK XV.,and Apollo made all haste on their way. When they reached
8367,BOOK XV.,"many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts, they found Jove"
8368,BOOK XV.,seated on topmost Gargarus with a fragrant cloud encircling his
8369,BOOK XV.,"head as with a diadem. They stood before his presence, and he was"
8370,BOOK XV.,pleased with them for having been so quick in obeying the orders
8371,BOOK XV.,his wife had given them.
8372,BOOK XV.,
8373,BOOK XV.,"He spoke to Iris first. “Go,” said he, “fleet Iris, tell King"
8374,BOOK XV.,Neptune what I now bid you—and tell him true. Bid him leave off
8375,BOOK XV.,"fighting, and either join the company of the gods, or go down"
8376,BOOK XV.,"into the sea. If he takes no heed and disobeys me, let him"
8377,BOOK XV.,consider well whether he is strong enough to hold his own against
8378,BOOK XV.,me if I attack him. I am older and much stronger than he is; yet
8379,BOOK XV.,"he is not afraid to set himself up as on a level with myself, of"
8380,BOOK XV.,whom all the other gods stand in awe.”
8381,BOOK XV.,
8382,BOOK XV.,"Iris, fleet as the wind, obeyed him, and as the cold hail or"
8383,BOOK XV.,snow-flakes that fly from out the clouds before the blast of
8384,BOOK XV.,"Boreas, even so did she wing her way till she came close up to"
8385,BOOK XV.,"the great shaker of the earth. Then she said, “I have come, O"
8386,BOOK XV.,"dark-haired king that holds the world in his embrace, to bring"
8387,BOOK XV.,"you a message from Jove. He bids you leave off fighting, and"
8388,BOOK XV.,"either join the company of the gods or go down into the sea; if,"
8389,BOOK XV.,"however, you take no heed and disobey him, he says he will come"
8390,BOOK XV.,"down here and fight you. He would have you keep out of his reach,"
8391,BOOK XV.,"for he is older and much stronger than you are, and yet you are"
8392,BOOK XV.,"not afraid to set yourself up as on a level with himself, of whom"
8393,BOOK XV.,all the other gods stand in awe.”
8394,BOOK XV.,
8395,BOOK XV.,"Neptune was very angry and said, “Great heavens! strong as Jove"
8396,BOOK XV.,"may be, he has said more than he can do if he has threatened"
8397,BOOK XV.,"violence against me, who am of like honour with himself. We were"
8398,BOOK XV.,"three brothers whom Rhea bore to Saturn—Jove, myself, and Hades"
8399,BOOK XV.,who rules the world below. Heaven and earth were divided into
8400,BOOK XV.,"three parts, and each of us was to have an equal share. When we"
8401,BOOK XV.,"cast lots, it fell to me to have my dwelling in the sea for"
8402,BOOK XV.,"evermore; Hades took the darkness of the realms under the earth,"
8403,BOOK XV.,while air and sky and clouds were the portion that fell to Jove;
8404,BOOK XV.,but earth and great Olympus are the common property of all.
8405,BOOK XV.,Therefore I will not walk as Jove would have me. For all his
8406,BOOK XV.,"strength, let him keep to his own third share and be contented"
8407,BOOK XV.,without threatening to lay hands upon me as though I were nobody.
8408,BOOK XV.,"Let him keep his bragging talk for his own sons and daughters,"
8409,BOOK XV.,who must perforce obey him.”
8410,BOOK XV.,
8411,BOOK XV.,"Iris fleet as the wind then answered, “Am I really, Neptune, to"
8412,BOOK XV.,"take this daring and unyielding message to Jove, or will you"
8413,BOOK XV.,"reconsider your answer? Sensible people are open to argument, and"
8414,BOOK XV.,you know that the Erinyes always range themselves on the side of
8415,BOOK XV.,the older person.”
8416,BOOK XV.,
8417,BOOK XV.,"Neptune answered, “Goddess Iris, your words have been spoken in"
8418,BOOK XV.,season. It is well when a messenger shows so much discretion.
8419,BOOK XV.,Nevertheless it cuts me to the very heart that any one should
8420,BOOK XV.,"rebuke so angrily another who is his own peer, and of like empire"
8421,BOOK XV.,"with himself. Now, however, I will give way in spite of my"
8422,BOOK XV.,"displeasure; furthermore let me tell you, and I mean what I"
8423,BOOK XV.,"say—if contrary to the desire of myself, Minerva driver of the"
8424,BOOK XV.,"spoil, Juno, Mercury, and King Vulcan, Jove spares steep Ilius,"
8425,BOOK XV.,and will not let the Achaeans have the great triumph of sacking
8426,BOOK XV.,"it, let him understand that he will incur our implacable"
8427,BOOK XV.,resentment.”
8428,BOOK XV.,
8429,BOOK XV.,"Neptune now left the field to go down under the sea, and sorely"
8430,BOOK XV.,"did the Achaeans miss him. Then Jove said to Apollo, “Go, dear"
8431,BOOK XV.,"Phoebus, to Hector, for Neptune who holds the earth in his"
8432,BOOK XV.,embrace has now gone down under the sea to avoid the severity of
8433,BOOK XV.,my displeasure. Had he not done so those gods who are below with
8434,BOOK XV.,Saturn would have come to hear of the fight between us. It is
8435,BOOK XV.,better for both of us that he should have curbed his anger and
8436,BOOK XV.,"kept out of my reach, for I should have had much trouble with"
8437,BOOK XV.,"him. Take, then, your tasselled aegis, and shake it furiously, so"
8438,BOOK XV.,"as to set the Achaean heroes in a panic; take, moreover, brave"
8439,BOOK XV.,"Hector, O Far-Darter, into your own care, and rouse him to deeds"
8440,BOOK XV.,"of daring, till the Achaeans are sent flying back to their ships"
8441,BOOK XV.,"and to the Hellespont. From that point I will think it well over,"
8442,BOOK XV.,how the Achaeans may have a respite from their troubles.”
8443,BOOK XV.,
8444,BOOK XV.,"Apollo obeyed his father’s saying, and left the crests of Ida,"
8445,BOOK XV.,"flying like a falcon, bane of doves and swiftest of all birds. He"
8446,BOOK XV.,"found Hector no longer lying upon the ground, but sitting up, for"
8447,BOOK XV.,he had just come to himself again. He knew those who were about
8448,BOOK XV.,"him, and the sweat and hard breathing had left him from the"
8449,BOOK XV.,moment when the will of aegis-bearing Jove had revived him.
8450,BOOK XV.,"Apollo stood beside him and said, “Hector son of Priam, why are"
8451,BOOK XV.,"you so faint, and why are you here away from the others? Has any"
8452,BOOK XV.,mishap befallen you?”
8453,BOOK XV.,
8454,BOOK XV.,"Hector in a weak voice answered, “And which, kind sir, of the"
8455,BOOK XV.,"gods are you, who now ask me thus? Do you not know that Ajax"
8456,BOOK XV.,struck me on the chest with a stone as I was killing his comrades
8457,BOOK XV.,"at the ships of the Achaeans, and compelled me to leave off"
8458,BOOK XV.,fighting? I made sure that this very day I should breathe my last
8459,BOOK XV.,and go down into the house of Hades.”
8460,BOOK XV.,
8461,BOOK XV.,"Then King Apollo said to him, “Take heart; the son of Saturn has"
8462,BOOK XV.,"sent you a mighty helper from Ida to stand by you and defend you,"
8463,BOOK XV.,"even me, Phoebus Apollo of the golden sword, who have been"
8464,BOOK XV.,"guardian hitherto not only of yourself but of your city. Now,"
8465,BOOK XV.,"therefore, order your horsemen to drive their chariots to the"
8466,BOOK XV.,ships in great multitudes. I will go before your horses to smooth
8467,BOOK XV.,"the way for them, and will turn the Achaeans in flight.”"
8468,BOOK XV.,
8469,BOOK XV.,As he spoke he infused great strength into the shepherd of his
8470,BOOK XV.,"people. And as a horse, stabled and full-fed, breaks loose and"
8471,BOOK XV.,gallops gloriously over the plain to the place where he is wont
8472,BOOK XV.,"to take his bath in the river—he tosses his head, and his mane"
8473,BOOK XV.,streams over his shoulders as in all the pride of his strength he
8474,BOOK XV.,flies full speed to the pastures where the mares are feeding—even
8475,BOOK XV.,"so Hector, when he heard what the god said, urged his horsemen"
8476,BOOK XV.,"on, and sped forward as fast as his limbs could take him. As"
8477,BOOK XV.,country peasants set their hounds on to a homed stag or wild
8478,BOOK XV.,"goat—he has taken shelter under rock or thicket, and they cannot"
8479,BOOK XV.,"find him, but, lo, a bearded lion whom their shouts have roused"
8480,BOOK XV.,"stands in their path, and they are in no further humour for the"
8481,BOOK XV.,"chase—even so the Achaeans were still charging on in a body,"
8482,BOOK XV.,"using their swords and spears pointed at both ends, but when they"
8483,BOOK XV.,"saw Hector going about among his men they were afraid, and their"
8484,BOOK XV.,hearts fell down into their feet.
8485,BOOK XV.,
8486,BOOK XV.,"Then spoke Thoas son of Andraemon, leader of the Aetolians, a man"
8487,BOOK XV.,"who could throw a good throw, and who was staunch also in close"
8488,BOOK XV.,"fight, while few could surpass him in debate when opinions were"
8489,BOOK XV.,divided. He then with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them
8490,BOOK XV.,"thus: “What, in heaven’s name, do I now see? Is it not Hector"
8491,BOOK XV.,come to life again? Every one made sure he had been killed by
8492,BOOK XV.,"Ajax son of Telamon, but it seems that one of the gods has again"
8493,BOOK XV.,"rescued him. He has killed many of us Danaans already, and I take"
8494,BOOK XV.,"it will yet do so, for the hand of Jove must be with him or he"
8495,BOOK XV.,would never dare show himself so masterful in the forefront of
8496,BOOK XV.,"the battle. Now, therefore, let us all do as I say; let us order"
8497,BOOK XV.,"the main body of our forces to fall back upon the ships, but let"
8498,BOOK XV.,"those of us who profess to be the flower of the army stand firm,"
8499,BOOK XV.,and see whether we cannot hold Hector back at the point of our
8500,BOOK XV.,spears as soon as he comes near us; I conceive that he will then
8501,BOOK XV.,think better of it before he tries to charge into the press of
8502,BOOK XV.,the Danaans.”
8503,BOOK XV.,
8504,BOOK XV.,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. Those who"
8505,BOOK XV.,"were about Ajax and King Idomeneus, the followers moreover of"
8506,BOOK XV.,"Teucer, Meriones, and Meges peer of Mars called all their best"
8507,BOOK XV.,men about them and sustained the fight against Hector and the
8508,BOOK XV.,"Trojans, but the main body fell back upon the ships of the"
8509,BOOK XV.,Achaeans.
8510,BOOK XV.,
8511,BOOK XV.,"The Trojans pressed forward in a dense body, with Hector striding"
8512,BOOK XV.,on at their head. Before him went Phoebus Apollo shrouded in
8513,BOOK XV.,cloud about his shoulders. He bore aloft the terrible aegis with
8514,BOOK XV.,"its shaggy fringe, which Vulcan the smith had given Jove to"
8515,BOOK XV.,strike terror into the hearts of men. With this in his hand he
8516,BOOK XV.,led on the Trojans.
8517,BOOK XV.,
8518,BOOK XV.,The Argives held together and stood their ground. The cry of
8519,BOOK XV.,"battle rose high from either side, and the arrows flew from the"
8520,BOOK XV.,bowstrings. Many a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in
8521,BOOK XV.,"the bodies of many a valiant warrior, while others fell to earth"
8522,BOOK XV.,"midway, before they could taste of man’s fair flesh and glut"
8523,BOOK XV.,themselves with blood. So long as Phoebus Apollo held his aegis
8524,BOOK XV.,"quietly and without shaking it, the weapons on either side took"
8525,BOOK XV.,"effect and the people fell, but when he shook it straight in the"
8526,BOOK XV.,face of the Danaans and raised his mighty battle-cry their hearts
8527,BOOK XV.,fainted within them and they forgot their former prowess. As when
8528,BOOK XV.,two wild beasts spring in the dead of night on a herd of cattle
8529,BOOK XV.,or a large flock of sheep when the herdsman is not there—even so
8530,BOOK XV.,"were the Danaans struck helpless, for Apollo filled them with"
8531,BOOK XV.,panic and gave victory to Hector and the Trojans.
8532,BOOK XV.,
8533,BOOK XV.,The fight then became more scattered and they killed one another
8534,BOOK XV.,"where they best could. Hector killed Stichius and Arcesilaus, the"
8535,BOOK XV.,"one, leader of the Boeotians, and the other, friend and comrade"
8536,BOOK XV.,of Menestheus. Aeneas killed Medon and Iasus. The first was
8537,BOOK XV.,"bastard son to Oileus, and brother to Ajax, but he lived in"
8538,BOOK XV.,"Phylace away from his own country, for he had killed a man, a"
8539,BOOK XV.,kinsman of his stepmother Eriopis whom Oileus had married. Iasus
8540,BOOK XV.,"had become a leader of the Athenians, and was son of Sphelus the"
8541,BOOK XV.,"son of Boucolos. Polydamas killed Mecisteus, and Polites Echius,"
8542,BOOK XV.,"in the front of the battle, while Agenor slew Clonius. Paris"
8543,BOOK XV.,"struck Deiochus from behind in the lower part of the shoulder, as"
8544,BOOK XV.,"he was flying among the foremost, and the point of the spear went"
8545,BOOK XV.,clean through him.
8546,BOOK XV.,
8547,BOOK XV.,"While they were spoiling these heroes of their armour, the"
8548,BOOK XV.,"Achaeans were flying pell-mell to the trench and the set stakes,"
8549,BOOK XV.,and were forced back within their wall. Hector then cried out to
8550,BOOK XV.,"the Trojans, “Forward to the ships, and let the spoils be. If I"
8551,BOOK XV.,see any man keeping back on the other side the wall away from the
8552,BOOK XV.,ships I will have him killed: his kinsmen and kinswomen shall not
8553,BOOK XV.,"give him his dues of fire, but dogs shall tear him in pieces in"
8554,BOOK XV.,front of our city.”
8555,BOOK XV.,
8556,BOOK XV.,As he spoke he laid his whip about his horses’ shoulders and
8557,BOOK XV.,called to the Trojans throughout their ranks; the Trojans shouted
8558,BOOK XV.,"with a cry that rent the air, and kept their horses neck and neck"
8559,BOOK XV.,"with his own. Phoebus Apollo went before, and kicked down the"
8560,BOOK XV.,banks of the deep trench into its middle so as to make a great
8561,BOOK XV.,"broad bridge, as broad as the throw of a spear when a man is"
8562,BOOK XV.,trying his strength. The Trojan battalions poured over the
8563,BOOK XV.,"bridge, and Apollo with his redoubtable aegis led the way. He"
8564,BOOK XV.,kicked down the wall of the Achaeans as easily as a child who
8565,BOOK XV.,playing on the sea-shore has built a house of sand and then kicks
8566,BOOK XV.,"it down again and destroys it—even so did you, O Apollo, shed"
8567,BOOK XV.,"toil and trouble upon the Argives, filling them with panic and"
8568,BOOK XV.,confusion.
8569,BOOK XV.,
8570,BOOK XV.,"Thus then were the Achaeans hemmed in at their ships, calling out"
8571,BOOK XV.,to one another and raising their hands with loud cries every man
8572,BOOK XV.,"to heaven. Nestor of Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans,"
8573,BOOK XV.,"lifted up his hands to the starry firmament of heaven, and prayed"
8574,BOOK XV.,"more fervently than any of them. “Father Jove,” said he, “if ever"
8575,BOOK XV.,any one in wheat-growing Argos burned you fat thigh-bones of
8576,BOOK XV.,"sheep or heifer and prayed that he might return safely home,"
8577,BOOK XV.,"whereon you bowed your head to him in assent, bear it in mind"
8578,BOOK XV.,"now, and suffer not the Trojans to triumph thus over the"
8579,BOOK XV.,Achaeans.”
8580,BOOK XV.,
8581,BOOK XV.,All-counselling Jove thundered loudly in answer to the prayer of
8582,BOOK XV.,the aged son of Neleus. When they heard Jove thunder they flung
8583,BOOK XV.,themselves yet more fiercely on the Achaeans. As a wave breaking
8584,BOOK XV.,over the bulwarks of a ship when the sea runs high before a
8585,BOOK XV.,gale—for it is the force of the wind that makes the waves so
8586,BOOK XV.,"great—even so did the Trojans spring over the wall with a shout,"
8587,BOOK XV.,and drive their chariots onwards. The two sides fought with their
8588,BOOK XV.,double-pointed spears in hand-to-hand encounter-the Trojans from
8589,BOOK XV.,"their chariots, and the Achaeans climbing up into their ships and"
8590,BOOK XV.,wielding the long pikes that were lying on the decks ready for
8591,BOOK XV.,"use in a sea-fight, jointed and shod with bronze."
8592,BOOK XV.,
8593,BOOK XV.,"Now Patroclus, so long as the Achaeans and Trojans were fighting"
8594,BOOK XV.,"about the wall, but were not yet within it and at the ships,"
8595,BOOK XV.,"remained sitting in the tent of good Eurypylus, entertaining him"
8596,BOOK XV.,with his conversation and spreading herbs over his wound to ease
8597,BOOK XV.,"his pain. When, however, he saw the Trojans swarming through the"
8598,BOOK XV.,"breach in the wall, while the Achaeans were clamouring and struck"
8599,BOOK XV.,"with panic, he cried aloud, and smote his two thighs with the"
8600,BOOK XV.,"flat of his hands. “Eurypylus,” said he in his dismay, “I know"
8601,BOOK XV.,"you want me badly, but I cannot stay with you any longer, for"
8602,BOOK XV.,there is hard fighting going on; a servant shall take care of you
8603,BOOK XV.,"now, for I must make all speed to Achilles, and induce him to"
8604,BOOK XV.,fight if I can; who knows but with heaven’s help I may persuade
8605,BOOK XV.,him. A man does well to listen to the advice of a friend.”
8606,BOOK XV.,
8607,BOOK XV.,When he had thus spoken he went his way. The Achaeans stood firm
8608,BOOK XV.,"and resisted the attack of the Trojans, yet though these were"
8609,BOOK XV.,"fewer in number, they could not drive them back from the ships,"
8610,BOOK XV.,neither could the Trojans break the Achaean ranks and make their
8611,BOOK XV.,way in among the tents and ships. As a carpenter’s line gives a
8612,BOOK XV.,"true edge to a piece of ship’s timber, in the hand of some"
8613,BOOK XV.,skilled workman whom Minerva has instructed in all kinds of
8614,BOOK XV.,useful arts—even so level was the issue of the fight between the
8615,BOOK XV.,"two sides, as they fought some round one and some round another."
8616,BOOK XV.,
8617,BOOK XV.,"Hector made straight for Ajax, and the two fought fiercely about"
8618,BOOK XV.,the same ship. Hector could not force Ajax back and fire the
8619,BOOK XV.,"ship, nor yet could Ajax drive Hector from the spot to which"
8620,BOOK XV.,heaven had brought him.
8621,BOOK XV.,
8622,BOOK XV.,Then Ajax struck Caletor son of Clytius in the chest with a spear
8623,BOOK XV.,as he was bringing fire towards the ship. He fell heavily to the
8624,BOOK XV.,ground and the torch dropped from his hand. When Hector saw his
8625,BOOK XV.,cousin fallen in front of the ship he shouted to the Trojans and
8626,BOOK XV.,"Lycians saying, “Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close"
8627,BOOK XV.,"fight, bate not a jot, but rescue the son of Clytius lest the"
8628,BOOK XV.,Achaeans strip him of his armour now that he has fallen.”
8629,BOOK XV.,
8630,BOOK XV.,"He then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him, but he hit"
8631,BOOK XV.,"Lycophron a follower of Ajax, who came from Cythera, but was"
8632,BOOK XV.,living with Ajax inasmuch as he had killed a man among the
8633,BOOK XV.,"Cythereans. Hector’s spear struck him on the head below the ear,"
8634,BOOK XV.,and he fell headlong from the ship’s prow on to the ground with
8635,BOOK XV.,no life left in him. Ajax shook with rage and said to his
8636,BOOK XV.,"brother, “Teucer, my good fellow, our trusty comrade the son of"
8637,BOOK XV.,"Mastor has fallen, he came to live with us from Cythera and whom"
8638,BOOK XV.,we honoured as much as our own parents. Hector has just killed
8639,BOOK XV.,him; fetch your deadly arrows at once and the bow which Phoebus
8640,BOOK XV.,Apollo gave you.”
8641,BOOK XV.,
8642,BOOK XV.,Teucer heard him and hastened towards him with his bow and quiver
8643,BOOK XV.,"in his hands. Forthwith he showered his arrows on the Trojans,"
8644,BOOK XV.,"and hit Cleitus the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the"
8645,BOOK XV.,"noble son of Panthous, with the reins in his hands as he was"
8646,BOOK XV.,attending to his horses; he was in the middle of the very
8647,BOOK XV.,"thickest part of the fight, doing good service to Hector and the"
8648,BOOK XV.,"Trojans, but evil had now come upon him, and not one of those who"
8649,BOOK XV.,"were fain to do so could avert it, for the arrow struck him on"
8650,BOOK XV.,the back of the neck. He fell from his chariot and his horses
8651,BOOK XV.,shook the empty car as they swerved aside. King Polydamas saw
8652,BOOK XV.,"what had happened, and was the first to come up to the horses; he"
8653,BOOK XV.,"gave them in charge to Astynous son of Protiaon, and ordered him"
8654,BOOK XV.,"to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. He then went"
8655,BOOK XV.,back and took his place in the front ranks.
8656,BOOK XV.,
8657,BOOK XV.,"Teucer then aimed another arrow at Hector, and there would have"
8658,BOOK XV.,been no more fighting at the ships if he had hit him and killed
8659,BOOK XV.,"him then and there: Jove, however, who kept watch over Hector,"
8660,BOOK XV.,"had his eyes on Teucer, and deprived him of his triumph, by"
8661,BOOK XV.,breaking his bowstring for him just as he was drawing it and
8662,BOOK XV.,about to take his aim; on this the arrow went astray and the bow
8663,BOOK XV.,fell from his hands. Teucer shook with anger and said to his
8664,BOOK XV.,"brother, “Alas, see how heaven thwarts us in all we do; it has"
8665,BOOK XV.,"broken my bowstring and snatched the bow from my hand, though I"
8666,BOOK XV.,strung it this self-same morning that it might serve me for many
8667,BOOK XV.,an arrow.”
8668,BOOK XV.,
8669,BOOK XV.,"Ajax son of Telamon answered, “My good fellow, let your bow and"
8670,BOOK XV.,"your arrows be, for Jove has made them useless in order to spite"
8671,BOOK XV.,"the Danaans. Take your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder,"
8672,BOOK XV.,and both fight the Trojans yourself and urge others to do so.
8673,BOOK XV.,They may be successful for the moment but if we fight as we ought
8674,BOOK XV.,they will find it a hard matter to take the ships.”
8675,BOOK XV.,
8676,BOOK XV.,Teucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a
8677,BOOK XV.,"shield four hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely"
8678,BOOK XV.,head he set his helmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair
8679,BOOK XV.,that nodded menacingly above it; he grasped his redoubtable
8680,BOOK XV.,"bronze-shod spear, and forthwith he was by the side of Ajax."
8681,BOOK XV.,
8682,BOOK XV.,"When Hector saw that Teucer’s bow was of no more use to him, he"
8683,BOOK XV.,"shouted out to the Trojans and Lycians, “Trojans, Lycians, and"
8684,BOOK XV.,"Dardanians good in close fight, be men, my friends, and show your"
8685,BOOK XV.,"mettle here at the ships, for I see the weapon of one of their"
8686,BOOK XV.,chieftains made useless by the hand of Jove. It is easy to see
8687,BOOK XV.,"when Jove is helping people and means to help them still further,"
8688,BOOK XV.,or again when he is bringing them down and will do nothing for
8689,BOOK XV.,"them; he is now on our side, and is going against the Argives."
8690,BOOK XV.,Therefore swarm round the ships and fight. If any of you is
8691,BOOK XV.,"struck by spear or sword and loses his life, let him die; he dies"
8692,BOOK XV.,with honour who dies fighting for his country; and he will leave
8693,BOOK XV.,"his wife and children safe behind him, with his house and"
8694,BOOK XV.,allotment unplundered if only the Achaeans can be driven back to
8695,BOOK XV.,"their own land, they and their ships.”"
8696,BOOK XV.,
8697,BOOK XV.,With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Ajax on the
8698,BOOK XV.,"other side exhorted his comrades saying, “Shame on you Argives,"
8699,BOOK XV.,"we are now utterly undone, unless we can save ourselves by"
8700,BOOK XV.,"driving the enemy from our ships. Do you think, if Hector takes"
8701,BOOK XV.,"them, that you will be able to get home by land? Can you not hear"
8702,BOOK XV.,"him cheering on his whole host to fire our fleet, and bidding"
8703,BOOK XV.,them remember that they are not at a dance but in battle? Our
8704,BOOK XV.,only course is to fight them with might and main; we had better
8705,BOOK XV.,"chance it, life or death, once for all, than fight long and"
8706,BOOK XV.,without issue hemmed in at our ships by worse men than
8707,BOOK XV.,ourselves.”
8708,BOOK XV.,
8709,BOOK XV.,With these words he put life and soul into them all. Hector then
8710,BOOK XV.,"killed Schedius son of Perimedes, leader of the Phoceans, and"
8711,BOOK XV.,Ajax killed Laodamas captain of foot soldiers and son to Antenor.
8712,BOOK XV.,Polydamas killed Otus of Cyllene a comrade of the son of Phyleus
8713,BOOK XV.,and chief of the proud Epeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon
8714,BOOK XV.,"him, but Polydamas crouched down, and he missed him, for Apollo"
8715,BOOK XV.,would not suffer the son of Panthous to fall in battle; but the
8716,BOOK XV.,"spear hit Croesmus in the middle of his chest, whereon he fell"
8717,BOOK XV.,"heavily to the ground, and Meges stripped him of his armour. At"
8718,BOOK XV.,that moment the valiant soldier Dolops son of Lampus sprang upon
8719,BOOK XV.,"Lampus was son of Laomedon and noted for his valour, while his"
8720,BOOK XV.,son Dolops was versed in all the ways of war. He then struck the
8721,BOOK XV.,"middle of the son of Phyleus’ shield with his spear, setting on"
8722,BOOK XV.,"him at close quarters, but his good corslet made with plates of"
8723,BOOK XV.,metal saved him; Phyleus had brought it from Ephyra and the river
8724,BOOK XV.,"Selleis, where his host, King Euphetes, had given it him to wear"
8725,BOOK XV.,in battle and protect him. It now served to save the life of his
8726,BOOK XV.,son. Then Meges struck the topmost crest of Dolops’s bronze
8727,BOOK XV.,"helmet with his spear and tore away its plume of horse-hair, so"
8728,BOOK XV.,that all newly dyed with scarlet as it was it tumbled down into
8729,BOOK XV.,"the dust. While he was still fighting and confident of victory,"
8730,BOOK XV.,"Menelaus came up to help Meges, and got by the side of Dolops"
8731,BOOK XV.,"unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder, from behind,"
8732,BOOK XV.,"and the point, driven so furiously, went through into his chest,"
8733,BOOK XV.,whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him to strip
8734,BOOK XV.,"him of his armour, but Hector called on all his brothers for"
8735,BOOK XV.,"help, and he especially upbraided brave Melanippus son of"
8736,BOOK XV.,"Hiketaon, who erewhile used to pasture his herds of cattle in"
8737,BOOK XV.,Percote before the war broke out; but when the ships of the
8738,BOOK XV.,"Danaans came, he went back to Ilius, where he was eminent among"
8739,BOOK XV.,"the Trojans, and lived near Priam who treated him as one of his"
8740,BOOK XV.,"own sons. Hector now rebuked him and said, “Why, Melanippus, are"
8741,BOOK XV.,"we thus remiss? do you take no note of the death of your kinsman,"
8742,BOOK XV.,and do you not see how they are trying to take Dolops’s armour?
8743,BOOK XV.,Follow me; there must be no fighting the Argives from a distance
8744,BOOK XV.,"now, but we must do so in close combat till either we kill them"
8745,BOOK XV.,or they take the high wall of Ilius and slay her people.”
8746,BOOK XV.,
8747,BOOK XV.,"He led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippus followed after."
8748,BOOK XV.,Meanwhile Ajax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. “My
8749,BOOK XV.,"friends,” he cried, “be men, and fear dishonour; quit yourselves"
8750,BOOK XV.,in battle so as to win respect from one another. Men who respect
8751,BOOK XV.,each other’s good opinion are less likely to be killed than those
8752,BOOK XV.,"who do not, but in flight there is neither gain nor glory.”"
8753,BOOK XV.,
8754,BOOK XV.,Thus did he exhort men who were already bent upon driving back
8755,BOOK XV.,the Trojans. They laid his words to heart and hedged the ships as
8756,BOOK XV.,"with a wall of bronze, while Jove urged on the Trojans. Menelaus"
8757,BOOK XV.,"of the loud battle-cry urged Antilochus on. “Antilochus,” said"
8758,BOOK XV.,"he, “you are young and there is none of the Achaeans more fleet"
8759,BOOK XV.,of foot or more valiant than you are. See if you cannot spring
8760,BOOK XV.,upon some Trojan and kill him.”
8761,BOOK XV.,
8762,BOOK XV.,"He hurried away when he had thus spurred Antilochus, who at once"
8763,BOOK XV.,"darted out from the front ranks and aimed a spear, after looking"
8764,BOOK XV.,"carefully round him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the"
8765,BOOK XV.,"dart did not speed from his hand without effect, for it struck"
8766,BOOK XV.,Melanippus the proud son of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple
8767,BOOK XV.,"as he was coming forward, and his armour rang rattling round him"
8768,BOOK XV.,as he fell heavily to the ground. Antilochus sprang upon him as a
8769,BOOK XV.,dog springs on a fawn which a hunter has hit as it was breaking
8770,BOOK XV.,"away from its covert, and killed it. Even so, O Melanippus, did"
8771,BOOK XV.,stalwart Antilochus spring upon you to strip you of your armour;
8772,BOOK XV.,"but noble Hector marked him, and came running up to him through"
8773,BOOK XV.,"the thick of the battle. Antilochus, brave soldier though he was,"
8774,BOOK XV.,"would not stay to face him, but fled like some savage creature"
8775,BOOK XV.,"which knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it has killed a"
8776,BOOK XV.,"dog or a man who is herding his cattle, before a body of men can"
8777,BOOK XV.,"be gathered to attack it. Even so did the son of Nestor fly, and"
8778,BOOK XV.,the Trojans and Hector with a cry that rent the air showered
8779,BOOK XV.,their weapons after him; nor did he turn round and stay his
8780,BOOK XV.,flight till he had reached his comrades.
8781,BOOK XV.,
8782,BOOK XV.,"The Trojans, fierce as lions, were still rushing on towards the"
8783,BOOK XV.,ships in fulfilment of the behests of Jove who kept spurring them
8784,BOOK XV.,"on to new deeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the"
8785,BOOK XV.,Argives and defeated them by encouraging the Trojans. For he
8786,BOOK XV.,"meant giving glory to Hector son of Priam, and letting him throw"
8787,BOOK XV.,"fire upon the ships, till he had fulfilled the unrighteous prayer"
8788,BOOK XV.,"that Thetis had made him; Jove, therefore, bided his time till he"
8789,BOOK XV.,should see the glare of a blazing ship. From that hour he was
8790,BOOK XV.,about so to order that the Trojans should be driven back from the
8791,BOOK XV.,ships and to vouchsafe glory to the Achaeans. With this purpose
8792,BOOK XV.,"he inspired Hector son of Priam, who was eager enough already, to"
8793,BOOK XV.,"assail the ships. His fury was as that of Mars, or as when a fire"
8794,BOOK XV.,is raging in the glades of some dense forest upon the mountains;
8795,BOOK XV.,"he foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared under his terrible"
8796,BOOK XV.,"eyebrows, and his helmet quivered on his temples by reason of"
8797,BOOK XV.,"the fury with which he fought. Jove from heaven was with him, and"
8798,BOOK XV.,"though he was but one against many, vouchsafed him victory and"
8799,BOOK XV.,"glory; for he was doomed to an early death, and already Pallas"
8800,BOOK XV.,Minerva was hurrying on the hour of his destruction at the hands
8801,BOOK XV.,"of the son of Peleus. Now, however, he kept trying to break the"
8802,BOOK XV.,"ranks of the enemy wherever he could see them thickest, and in"
8803,BOOK XV.,the goodliest armour; but do what he might he could not break
8804,BOOK XV.,"through them, for they stood as a tower foursquare, or as some"
8805,BOOK XV.,high cliff rising from the grey sea that braves the anger of the
8806,BOOK XV.,"gale, and of the waves that thunder up against it. He fell upon"
8807,BOOK XV.,"them like flames of fire from every quarter. As when a wave,"
8808,BOOK XV.,"raised mountain high by wind and storm, breaks over a ship and"
8809,BOOK XV.,"covers it deep in foam, the fierce winds roar against the mast,"
8810,BOOK XV.,"the hearts of the sailors fail them for fear, and they are saved"
8811,BOOK XV.,but by a very little from destruction—even so were the hearts of
8812,BOOK XV.,the Achaeans fainting within them. Or as a savage lion attacking
8813,BOOK XV.,a herd of cows while they are feeding by thousands in the
8814,BOOK XV.,low-lying meadows by some wide-watered shore—the herdsman is at
8815,BOOK XV.,his wit’s end how to protect his herd and keeps going about now
8816,BOOK XV.,"in the van and now in the rear of his cattle, while the lion"
8817,BOOK XV.,springs into the thick of them and fastens on a cow so that they
8818,BOOK XV.,all tremble for fear—even so were the Achaeans utterly
8819,BOOK XV.,panic-stricken by Hector and father Jove. Nevertheless Hector
8820,BOOK XV.,only killed Periphetes of Mycenae; he was son of Copreus who was
8821,BOOK XV.,"wont to take the orders of King Eurystheus to mighty Hercules,"
8822,BOOK XV.,but the son was a far better man than the father in every way; he
8823,BOOK XV.,"was fleet of foot, a valiant warrior, and in understanding ranked"
8824,BOOK XV.,among the foremost men of Mycenae. He it was who then afforded
8825,BOOK XV.,"Hector a triumph, for as he was turning back he stumbled against"
8826,BOOK XV.,"the rim of his shield which reached his feet, and served to keep"
8827,BOOK XV.,the javelins off him. He tripped against this and fell face
8828,BOOK XV.,"upward, his helmet ringing loudly about his head as he did so."
8829,BOOK XV.,Hector saw him fall and ran up to him; he then thrust a spear
8830,BOOK XV.,"into his chest, and killed him close to his own comrades. These,"
8831,BOOK XV.,"for all their sorrow, could not help him for they were themselves"
8832,BOOK XV.,terribly afraid of Hector.
8833,BOOK XV.,
8834,BOOK XV.,They had now reached the ships and the prows of those that had
8835,BOOK XV.,"been drawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans"
8836,BOOK XV.,came pouring after them. The Argives were driven back from the
8837,BOOK XV.,"first row of ships, but they made a stand by their tents without"
8838,BOOK XV.,being broken up and scattered; shame and fear restrained them.
8839,BOOK XV.,"They kept shouting incessantly to one another, and Nestor of"
8840,BOOK XV.,"Gerene, tower of strength to the Achaeans, was loudest in"
8841,BOOK XV.,"imploring every man by his parents, and beseeching him to stand"
8842,BOOK XV.,firm.
8843,BOOK XV.,
8844,BOOK XV.,"“Be men, my friends,” he cried, “and respect one another’s good"
8845,BOOK XV.,"opinion. Think, all of you, on your children, your wives, your"
8846,BOOK XV.,"property, and your parents whether these be alive or dead. On"
8847,BOOK XV.,"their behalf though they are not here, I implore you to stand"
8848,BOOK XV.,"firm, and not to turn in flight.”"
8849,BOOK XV.,
8850,BOOK XV.,With these words he put heart and soul into them all. Minerva
8851,BOOK XV.,"lifted the thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light"
8852,BOOK XV.,"fell upon them, alike on the side of the ships and on that where"
8853,BOOK XV.,"the fight was raging. They could see Hector and all his men, both"
8854,BOOK XV.,"those in the rear who were taking no part in the battle, and"
8855,BOOK XV.,those who were fighting by the ships.
8856,BOOK XV.,
8857,BOOK XV.,"Ajax could not bring himself to retreat along with the rest, but"
8858,BOOK XV.,strode from deck to deck with a great sea-pike in his hands
8859,BOOK XV.,twelve cubits long and jointed with rings. As a man skilled in
8860,BOOK XV.,feats of horsemanship couples four horses together and comes
8861,BOOK XV.,tearing full speed along the public way from the country into
8862,BOOK XV.,some large town—many both men and women marvel as they see him
8863,BOOK XV.,"for he keeps all the time changing his horse, springing from one"
8864,BOOK XV.,to another without ever missing his feet while the horses are at
8865,BOOK XV.,a gallop—even so did Ajax go striding from one ship’s deck to
8866,BOOK XV.,"another, and his voice went up into the heavens. He kept on"
8867,BOOK XV.,shouting his orders to the Danaans and exhorting them to defend
8868,BOOK XV.,their ships and tents; neither did Hector remain within the main
8869,BOOK XV.,"body of the Trojan warriors, but as a dun eagle swoops down upon"
8870,BOOK XV.,"a flock of wild-fowl feeding near a river—geese, it may be, or"
8871,BOOK XV.,"cranes, or long-necked swans—even so did Hector make straight for"
8872,BOOK XV.,"a dark-prowed ship, rushing right towards it; for Jove with his"
8873,BOOK XV.,"mighty hand impelled him forward, and roused his people to follow"
8874,BOOK XV.,him.
8875,BOOK XV.,
8876,BOOK XV.,And now the battle again raged furiously at the ships. You would
8877,BOOK XV.,"have thought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so"
8878,BOOK XV.,fiercely did they fight; and this was the mind in which they
8879,BOOK XV.,were—the Achaeans did not believe they should escape destruction
8880,BOOK XV.,"but thought themselves doomed, while there was not a Trojan but"
8881,BOOK XV.,his heart beat high with the hope of firing the ships and putting
8882,BOOK XV.,the Achaean heroes to the sword.
8883,BOOK XV.,
8884,BOOK XV.,Thus were the two sides minded. Then Hector seized the stern of
8885,BOOK XV.,"the good ship that had brought Protesilaus to Troy, but never"
8886,BOOK XV.,bore him back to his native land. Round this ship there raged a
8887,BOOK XV.,close hand-to-hand fight between Danaans and Trojans. They did
8888,BOOK XV.,"not fight at a distance with bows and javelins, but with one mind"
8889,BOOK XV.,hacked at one another in close combat with their mighty swords
8890,BOOK XV.,and spears pointed at both ends; they fought moreover with keen
8891,BOOK XV.,battle-axes and with hatchets. Many a good stout blade hilted and
8892,BOOK XV.,"scabbarded with iron, fell from hand or shoulder as they fought,"
8893,BOOK XV.,"and the earth ran red with blood. Hector, when he had seized the"
8894,BOOK XV.,"ship, would not loose his hold but held on to its curved stern"
8895,BOOK XV.,"and shouted to the Trojans, “Bring fire, and raise the battle-cry"
8896,BOOK XV.,all of you with a single voice. Now has Jove vouchsafed us a day
8897,BOOK XV.,that will pay us for all the rest; this day we shall take the
8898,BOOK XV.,"ships which came hither against heaven’s will, and which have"
8899,BOOK XV.,caused us such infinite suffering through the cowardice of our
8900,BOOK XV.,"councillors, who when I would have done battle at the ships held"
8901,BOOK XV.,me back and forbade the host to follow me; if Jove did then
8902,BOOK XV.,"indeed warp our judgements, himself now commands me and cheers me"
8903,BOOK XV.,on.”
8904,BOOK XV.,
8905,BOOK XV.,As he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more fiercely on the
8906,BOOK XV.,"Achaeans, and Ajax no longer held his ground, for he was overcome"
8907,BOOK XV.,"by the darts that were flung at him, and made sure that he was"
8908,BOOK XV.,"doomed. Therefore he left the raised deck at the stern, and"
8909,BOOK XV.,stepped back on to the seven-foot bench of the oarsmen. Here he
8910,BOOK XV.,"stood on the look-out, and with his spear held back any Trojan"
8911,BOOK XV.,whom he saw bringing fire to the ships. All the time he kept on
8912,BOOK XV.,shouting at the top of his voice and exhorting the Danaans. “My
8913,BOOK XV.,"friends,” he cried, “Danaan heroes, servants of Mars, be men my"
8914,BOOK XV.,"friends, and fight with might and with main. Can we hope to find"
8915,BOOK XV.,"helpers hereafter, or a wall to shield us more surely than the"
8916,BOOK XV.,"one we have? There is no strong city within reach, whence we may"
8917,BOOK XV.,draw fresh forces to turn the scales in our favour. We are on the
8918,BOOK XV.,"plain of the armed Trojans with the sea behind us, and far from"
8919,BOOK XV.,"our own country. Our salvation, therefore, is in the might of our"
8920,BOOK XV.,hands and in hard fighting.”
8921,BOOK XV.,
8922,BOOK XV.,"As he spoke he wielded his spear with still greater fury, and"
8923,BOOK XV.,when any Trojan made towards the ships with fire at Hector’s
8924,BOOK XV.,"bidding, he would be on the look-out for him, and drive at him"
8925,BOOK XV.,with his long spear. Twelve men did he thus kill in hand-to-hand
8926,BOOK XV.,fight before the ships.
8927,BOOK XV.,
8928,BOOK XV.,
8929,BOOK XV.,
8930,BOOK XV.,
8931,BOOK XVI.,BOOK XVI.
8932,BOOK XVI.,
8933,BOOK XVI.,
8934,BOOK XVI.,"Fire being now thrown on the ship of Protesilaus, Patroclus"
8935,BOOK XVI.,"fights in the armour of Achilles—He drives the Trojans back, but"
8936,BOOK XVI.,is in the end killed by Euphorbus and Hector.
8937,BOOK XVI.,
8938,BOOK XVI.,Thus did they fight about the ship of Protesilaus. Then Patroclus
8939,BOOK XVI.,"drew near to Achilles with tears welling from his eyes, as from"
8940,BOOK XVI.,some spring whose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high
8941,BOOK XVI.,precipice. When Achilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for
8942,BOOK XVI.,"him and said, “Why, Patroclus, do you stand there weeping like"
8943,BOOK XVI.,"some silly child that comes running to her mother, and begs to be"
8944,BOOK XVI.,taken up and carried—she catches hold of her mother’s dress to
8945,BOOK XVI.,"stay her though she is in a hurry, and looks tearfully up until"
8946,BOOK XVI.,"her mother carries her—even such tears, Patroclus, are you now"
8947,BOOK XVI.,shedding. Have you anything to say to the Myrmidons or to myself?
8948,BOOK XVI.,or have you had news from Phthia which you alone know? They tell
8949,BOOK XVI.,"me Menoetius son of Actor is still alive, as also Peleus son of"
8950,BOOK XVI.,"Aeacus, among the Myrmidons—men whose loss we two should bitterly"
8951,BOOK XVI.,deplore; or are you grieving about the Argives and the way in
8952,BOOK XVI.,"which they are being killed at the ships, through their own"
8953,BOOK XVI.,high-handed doings? Do not hide anything from me but tell me that
8954,BOOK XVI.,both of us may know about it.”
8955,BOOK XVI.,
8956,BOOK XVI.,"Then, O knight Patroclus, with a deep sigh you answered,"
8957,BOOK XVI.,"“Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the Achaeans, do"
8958,BOOK XVI.,"not be angry, but I weep for the disaster that has now befallen"
8959,BOOK XVI.,the Argives. All those who have been their champions so far are
8960,BOOK XVI.,"lying at the ships, wounded by sword or spear. Brave Diomed son"
8961,BOOK XVI.,"of Tydeus has been hit with a spear, while famed Ulysses and"
8962,BOOK XVI.,Agamemnon have received sword-wounds; Eurypylus again has been
8963,BOOK XVI.,struck with an arrow in the thigh; skilled apothecaries are
8964,BOOK XVI.,"attending to these heroes, and healing them of their wounds; are"
8965,BOOK XVI.,"you still, O Achilles, so inexorable? May it never be my lot to"
8966,BOOK XVI.,"nurse such a passion as you have done, to the baning of your own"
8967,BOOK XVI.,good name. Who in future story will speak well of you unless you
8968,BOOK XVI.,now save the Argives from ruin? You know no pity; knight Peleus
8969,BOOK XVI.,"was not your father nor Thetis your mother, but the grey sea bore"
8970,BOOK XVI.,"you and the sheer cliffs begot you, so cruel and remorseless are"
8971,BOOK XVI.,you. If however you are kept back through knowledge of some
8972,BOOK XVI.,"oracle, or if your mother Thetis has told you something from the"
8973,BOOK XVI.,"mouth of Jove, at least send me and the Myrmidons with me, if I"
8974,BOOK XVI.,may bring deliverance to the Danaans. Let me moreover wear your
8975,BOOK XVI.,armour; the Trojans may thus mistake me for you and quit the
8976,BOOK XVI.,"field, so that the hard-pressed sons of the Achaeans may have"
8977,BOOK XVI.,breathing time—which while they are fighting may hardly be. We
8978,BOOK XVI.,who are fresh might soon drive tired men back from our ships and
8979,BOOK XVI.,tents to their own city.”
8980,BOOK XVI.,
8981,BOOK XVI.,"He knew not what he was asking, nor that he was suing for his own"
8982,BOOK XVI.,"destruction. Achilles was deeply moved and answered, “What, noble"
8983,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I am"
8984,BOOK XVI.,"heeding, nor has my mother told me anything from the mouth of"
8985,BOOK XVI.,"Jove, but I am cut to the very heart that one of my own rank"
8986,BOOK XVI.,should dare to rob me because he is more powerful than I am.
8987,BOOK XVI.,"This, after all that I have gone through, is more than I can"
8988,BOOK XVI.,"endure. The girl whom the sons of the Achaeans chose for me, whom"
8989,BOOK XVI.,I won as the fruit of my spear on having sacked a city—her has
8990,BOOK XVI.,King Agamemnon taken from me as though I were some common
8991,BOOK XVI.,"vagrant. Still, let bygones be bygones: no man may keep his anger"
8992,BOOK XVI.,for ever; I said I would not relent till battle and the cry of
8993,BOOK XVI.,"war had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird my armour"
8994,BOOK XVI.,"about your shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle, for the"
8995,BOOK XVI.,dark cloud of Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet; the
8996,BOOK XVI.,"Argives are driven back on to the beach, cooped within a narrow"
8997,BOOK XVI.,"space, and the whole people of Troy has taken heart to sally out"
8998,BOOK XVI.,"against them, because they see not the visor of my helmet"
8999,BOOK XVI.,"gleaming near them. Had they seen this, there would not have been"
9000,BOOK XVI.,a creek nor grip that had not been filled with their dead as they
9001,BOOK XVI.,"fled back again. And so it would have been, if only King"
9002,BOOK XVI.,Agamemnon had dealt fairly by me. As it is the Trojans have beset
9003,BOOK XVI.,our host. Diomed son of Tydeus no longer wields his spear to
9004,BOOK XVI.,"defend the Danaans, neither have I heard the voice of the son of"
9005,BOOK XVI.,"Atreus coming from his hated head, whereas that of murderous"
9006,BOOK XVI.,"Hector rings in my cars as he gives orders to the Trojans, who"
9007,BOOK XVI.,triumph over the Achaeans and fill the whole plain with their cry
9008,BOOK XVI.,"of battle. But even so, Patroclus, fall upon them and save the"
9009,BOOK XVI.,"fleet, lest the Trojans fire it and prevent us from being able to"
9010,BOOK XVI.,"return. Do, however, as I now bid you, that you may win me great"
9011,BOOK XVI.,"honour from all the Danaans, and that they may restore the girl"
9012,BOOK XVI.,to me again and give me rich gifts into the bargain. When you
9013,BOOK XVI.,"have driven the Trojans from the ships, come back again. Though"
9014,BOOK XVI.,"Juno’s thundering husband should put triumph within your reach,"
9015,BOOK XVI.,"do not fight the Trojans further in my absence, or you will rob"
9016,BOOK XVI.,me of glory that should be mine. And do not for lust of battle go
9017,BOOK XVI.,"on killing the Trojans nor lead the Achaeans on to Ilius, lest"
9018,BOOK XVI.,one of the ever-living gods from Olympus attack you—for Phoebus
9019,BOOK XVI.,Apollo loves them well: return when you have freed the ships from
9020,BOOK XVI.,"peril, and let others wage war upon the plain. Would, by father"
9021,BOOK XVI.,"Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that not a single man of all the"
9022,BOOK XVI.,"Trojans might be left alive, nor yet of the Argives, but that we"
9023,BOOK XVI.,two might be alone left to tear aside the mantle that veils the
9024,BOOK XVI.,brow of Troy.”
9025,BOOK XVI.,
9026,BOOK XVI.,Thus did they converse. But Ajax could no longer hold his ground
9027,BOOK XVI.,for the shower of darts that rained upon him; the will of Jove
9028,BOOK XVI.,and the javelins of the Trojans were too much for him; the helmet
9029,BOOK XVI.,that gleamed about his temples rang with the continuous clatter
9030,BOOK XVI.,of the missiles that kept pouring on to it and on to the
9031,BOOK XVI.,cheek-pieces that protected his face. Moreover his left shoulder
9032,BOOK XVI.,"was tired with having held his shield so long, yet for all this,"
9033,BOOK XVI.,"let fly at him as they would, they could not make him give"
9034,BOOK XVI.,"ground. He could hardly draw his breath, the sweat rained from"
9035,BOOK XVI.,"every pore of his body, he had not a moment’s respite, and on all"
9036,BOOK XVI.,sides he was beset by danger upon danger.
9037,BOOK XVI.,
9038,BOOK XVI.,"And now, tell me, O Muses that hold your mansions on Olympus, how"
9039,BOOK XVI.,fire was thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hector came close
9040,BOOK XVI.,up and let drive with his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax.
9041,BOOK XVI.,He cut it clean in two just behind where the point was fastened
9042,BOOK XVI.,"on to the shaft of the spear. Ajax, therefore, had now nothing"
9043,BOOK XVI.,"but a headless spear, while the bronze point flew some way off"
9044,BOOK XVI.,and came ringing down on to the ground. Ajax knew the hand of
9045,BOOK XVI.,"heaven in this, and was dismayed at seeing that Jove had now left"
9046,BOOK XVI.,him utterly defenceless and was willing victory for the Trojans.
9047,BOOK XVI.,"Therefore he drew back, and the Trojans flung fire upon the ship"
9048,BOOK XVI.,which was at once wrapped in flame.
9049,BOOK XVI.,
9050,BOOK XVI.,"The fire was now flaring about the ship’s stern, whereon Achilles"
9051,BOOK XVI.,"smote his two thighs and said to Patroclus, “Up, noble knight,"
9052,BOOK XVI.,"for I see the glare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they"
9053,BOOK XVI.,"destroy our ships, and there be no way by which we may retreat."
9054,BOOK XVI.,Gird on your armour at once while I call our people together.”
9055,BOOK XVI.,
9056,BOOK XVI.,As he spoke Patroclus put on his armour. First he greaved his
9057,BOOK XVI.,"legs with greaves of good make, and fitted with ancle-clasps of"
9058,BOOK XVI.,"silver; after this he donned the cuirass of the son of Aeacus,"
9059,BOOK XVI.,richly inlaid and studded. He hung his silver-studded sword of
9060,BOOK XVI.,"bronze about his shoulders, and then his mighty shield. On his"
9061,BOOK XVI.,"comely head he set his helmet, well wrought, with a crest of"
9062,BOOK XVI.,horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it. He grasped two
9063,BOOK XVI.,"redoubtable spears that suited his hands, but he did not take the"
9064,BOOK XVI.,"spear of noble Achilles, so stout and strong, for none other of"
9065,BOOK XVI.,"the Achaeans could wield it, though Achilles could do so easily."
9066,BOOK XVI.,"This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion, which Chiron had cut"
9067,BOOK XVI.,"upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus, wherewith to deal"
9068,BOOK XVI.,out death among heroes. He bade Automedon yoke his horses with
9069,BOOK XVI.,"all speed, for he was the man whom he held in honour next after"
9070,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles, and on whose support in battle he could rely most"
9071,BOOK XVI.,firmly. Automedon therefore yoked the fleet horses Xanthus and
9072,BOOK XVI.,"Balius, steeds that could fly like the wind: these were they whom"
9073,BOOK XVI.,"the harpy Podarge bore to the west wind, as she was grazing in a"
9074,BOOK XVI.,meadow by the waters of the river Oceanus. In the side traces he
9075,BOOK XVI.,"set the noble horse Pedasus, whom Achilles had brought away with"
9076,BOOK XVI.,"him when he sacked the city of Eetion, and who, mortal steed"
9077,BOOK XVI.,"though he was, could take his place along with those that were"
9078,BOOK XVI.,immortal.
9079,BOOK XVI.,
9080,BOOK XVI.,"Meanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among the tents, and"
9081,BOOK XVI.,bade his Myrmidons put on their armour. Even as fierce ravening
9082,BOOK XVI.,wolves that are feasting upon a homed stag which they have killed
9083,BOOK XVI.,"upon the mountains, and their jaws are red with blood—they go in"
9084,BOOK XVI.,a pack to lap water from the clear spring with their long thin
9085,BOOK XVI.,tongues; and they reek of blood and slaughter; they know not what
9086,BOOK XVI.,"fear is, for it is hunger drives them—even so did the leaders and"
9087,BOOK XVI.,counsellors of the Myrmidons gather round the good squire of the
9088,BOOK XVI.,"fleet descendant of Aeacus, and among them stood Achilles himself"
9089,BOOK XVI.,cheering on both men and horses.
9090,BOOK XVI.,
9091,BOOK XVI.,"Fifty ships had noble Achilles brought to Troy, and in each there"
9092,BOOK XVI.,was a crew of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five captains whom
9093,BOOK XVI.,"he could trust, while he was himself commander over them all."
9094,BOOK XVI.,"Menesthius of the gleaming corslet, son to the river Spercheius"
9095,BOOK XVI.,"that streams from heaven, was captain of the first company. Fair"
9096,BOOK XVI.,Polydora daughter of Peleus bore him to ever-flowing Spercheius—a
9097,BOOK XVI.,woman mated with a god—but he was called son of Borus son of
9098,BOOK XVI.,"Perieres, with whom his mother was living as his wedded wife, and"
9099,BOOK XVI.,who gave great wealth to gain her. The second company was led by
9100,BOOK XVI.,"noble Eudorus, son to an unwedded woman. Polymele, daughter of"
9101,BOOK XVI.,"Phylas the graceful dancer, bore him; the mighty slayer of Argos"
9102,BOOK XVI.,was enamoured of her as he saw her among the singing women at a
9103,BOOK XVI.,dance held in honour of Diana the rushing huntress of the golden
9104,BOOK XVI.,"arrows; he therefore—Mercury, giver of all good—went with her"
9105,BOOK XVI.,"into an upper chamber, and lay with her in secret, whereon she"
9106,BOOK XVI.,"bore him a noble son Eudorus, singularly fleet of foot and in"
9107,BOOK XVI.,fight valiant. When Ilithuia goddess of the pains of childbirth
9108,BOOK XVI.,"brought him to the light of day, and he saw the face of the sun,"
9109,BOOK XVI.,"mighty Echecles son of Actor took the mother to wife, and gave"
9110,BOOK XVI.,"great wealth to gain her, but her father Phylas brought the child"
9111,BOOK XVI.,"up, and took care of him, doting as fondly upon him as though he"
9112,BOOK XVI.,were his own son. The third company was led by Pisander son of
9113,BOOK XVI.,"Maemalus, the finest spearman among all the Myrmidons next to"
9114,BOOK XVI.,Achilles’ own comrade Patroclus. The old knight Phoenix was
9115,BOOK XVI.,"captain of the fourth company, and Alcimedon, noble son of"
9116,BOOK XVI.,Laerceus of the fifth.
9117,BOOK XVI.,
9118,BOOK XVI.,When Achilles had chosen his men and had stationed them all with
9119,BOOK XVI.,"their captains, he charged them straitly saying, “Myrmidons,"
9120,BOOK XVI.,remember your threats against the Trojans while you were at the
9121,BOOK XVI.,"ships in the time of my anger, and you were all complaining of"
9122,BOOK XVI.,"me. ‘Cruel son of Peleus,’ you would say, ‘your mother must have"
9123,BOOK XVI.,"suckled you on gall, so ruthless are you. You keep us here at the"
9124,BOOK XVI.,ships against our will; if you are so relentless it were better
9125,BOOK XVI.,we went home over the sea.’ Often have you gathered and thus
9126,BOOK XVI.,chided with me. The hour is now come for those high feats of arms
9127,BOOK XVI.,"that you have so long been pining for, therefore keep high hearts"
9128,BOOK XVI.,each one of you to do battle with the Trojans.”
9129,BOOK XVI.,
9130,BOOK XVI.,"With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they"
9131,BOOK XVI.,serried their companies yet more closely when they heard the
9132,BOOK XVI.,words of their king. As the stones which a builder sets in the
9133,BOOK XVI.,wall of some high house which is to give shelter from the
9134,BOOK XVI.,winds—even so closely were the helmets and bossed shields set
9135,BOOK XVI.,"against one another. Shield pressed on shield, helm on helm, and"
9136,BOOK XVI.,man on man; so close were they that the horse-hair plumes on the
9137,BOOK XVI.,gleaming ridges of their helmets touched each other as they bent
9138,BOOK XVI.,their heads.
9139,BOOK XVI.,
9140,BOOK XVI.,In front of them all two men put on their armour—Patroclus and
9141,BOOK XVI.,"Automedon—two men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons. Then"
9142,BOOK XVI.,Achilles went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong
9143,BOOK XVI.,chest which silver-footed Thetis had given him to take on board
9144,BOOK XVI.,"ship, and which she had filled with shirts, cloaks to keep out"
9145,BOOK XVI.,"the cold, and good thick rugs. In this chest he had a cup of rare"
9146,BOOK XVI.,"workmanship, from which no man but himself might drink, nor would"
9147,BOOK XVI.,he make offering from it to any other god save only to father
9148,BOOK XVI.,Jove. He took the cup from the chest and cleansed it with
9149,BOOK XVI.,"sulphur; this done he rinsed it clean water, and after he had"
9150,BOOK XVI.,washed his hands he drew wine. Then he stood in the middle of the
9151,BOOK XVI.,"court and prayed, looking towards heaven, and making his"
9152,BOOK XVI.,drink-offering of wine; nor was he unseen of Jove whose joy is in
9153,BOOK XVI.,"thunder. “King Jove,” he cried, “lord of Dodona, god of the"
9154,BOOK XVI.,"Pelasgi, who dwellest afar, you who hold wintry Dodona in your"
9155,BOOK XVI.,"sway, where your prophets the Selli dwell around you with their"
9156,BOOK XVI.,feet unwashed and their couches made upon the ground—if you heard
9157,BOOK XVI.,"me when I prayed to you aforetime, and did me honour while you"
9158,BOOK XVI.,"sent disaster on the Achaeans, vouchsafe me now the fulfilment of"
9159,BOOK XVI.,yet this further prayer. I shall stay here where my ships are
9160,BOOK XVI.,"lying, but I shall send my comrade into battle at the head of"
9161,BOOK XVI.,"many Myrmidons. Grant, O all-seeing Jove, that victory may go"
9162,BOOK XVI.,with him; put your courage into his heart that Hector may learn
9163,BOOK XVI.,"whether my squire is man enough to fight alone, or whether his"
9164,BOOK XVI.,might is only then so indomitable when I myself enter the turmoil
9165,BOOK XVI.,of war. Afterwards when he has chased the fight and the cry of
9166,BOOK XVI.,"battle from the ships, grant that he may return unharmed, with"
9167,BOOK XVI.,"his armour and his comrades, fighters in close combat.”"
9168,BOOK XVI.,
9169,BOOK XVI.,"Thus did he pray, and all-counselling Jove heard his prayer. Part"
9170,BOOK XVI.,of it he did indeed vouchsafe him—but not the whole. He granted
9171,BOOK XVI.,"that Patroclus should thrust back war and battle from the ships,"
9172,BOOK XVI.,but refused to let him come safely out of the fight.
9173,BOOK XVI.,
9174,BOOK XVI.,"When he had made his drink-offering and had thus prayed, Achilles"
9175,BOOK XVI.,went inside his tent and put back the cup into his chest.
9176,BOOK XVI.,
9177,BOOK XVI.,"Then he again came out, for he still loved to look upon the"
9178,BOOK XVI.,fierce fight that raged between the Trojans and Achaeans.
9179,BOOK XVI.,
9180,BOOK XVI.,Meanwhile the armed band that was about Patroclus marched on till
9181,BOOK XVI.,they sprang high in hope upon the Trojans. They came swarming out
9182,BOOK XVI.,"like wasps whose nests are by the roadside, and whom silly"
9183,BOOK XVI.,"children love to tease, whereon any one who happens to be passing"
9184,BOOK XVI.,"may get stung—or again, if a wayfarer going along the road vexes"
9185,BOOK XVI.,"them by accident, every wasp will come flying out in a fury to"
9186,BOOK XVI.,defend his little ones—even with such rage and courage did the
9187,BOOK XVI.,"Myrmidons swarm from their ships, and their cry of battle rose"
9188,BOOK XVI.,heavenwards. Patroclus called out to his men at the top of his
9189,BOOK XVI.,"voice, “Myrmidons, followers of Achilles son of Peleus, be men my"
9190,BOOK XVI.,"friends, fight with might and with main, that we may win glory"
9191,BOOK XVI.,"for the son of Peleus, who is far the foremost man at the ships"
9192,BOOK XVI.,"of the Argives—he, and his close fighting followers. The son of"
9193,BOOK XVI.,Atreus King Agamemnon will thus learn his folly in showing no
9194,BOOK XVI.,respect to the bravest of the Achaeans.”
9195,BOOK XVI.,
9196,BOOK XVI.,"With these words he put heart and soul into them all, and they"
9197,BOOK XVI.,fell in a body upon the Trojans. The ships rang again with the
9198,BOOK XVI.,"cry which the Achaeans raised, and when the Trojans saw the brave"
9199,BOOK XVI.,"son of Menoetius and his squire all gleaming in their armour,"
9200,BOOK XVI.,they were daunted and their battalions were thrown into
9201,BOOK XVI.,"confusion, for they thought the fleet son of Peleus must now have"
9202,BOOK XVI.,"put aside his anger, and have been reconciled to Agamemnon; every"
9203,BOOK XVI.,"one, therefore, looked round about to see whither he might fly"
9204,BOOK XVI.,for safety.
9205,BOOK XVI.,
9206,BOOK XVI.,Patroclus first aimed a spear into the middle of the press where
9207,BOOK XVI.,"men were packed most closely, by the stern of the ship of"
9208,BOOK XVI.,Protesilaus. He hit Pyraechmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen
9209,BOOK XVI.,from the Amydon and the broad waters of the river Axius; the
9210,BOOK XVI.,"spear struck him on the right shoulder, and with a groan he fell"
9211,BOOK XVI.,backwards in the dust; on this his men were thrown into
9212,BOOK XVI.,"confusion, for by killing their leader, who was the finest"
9213,BOOK XVI.,"soldier among them, Patroclus struck panic into them all. He thus"
9214,BOOK XVI.,drove them from the ship and quenched the fire that was then
9215,BOOK XVI.,blazing—leaving the half-burnt ship to lie where it was. The
9216,BOOK XVI.,"Trojans were now driven back with a shout that rent the skies,"
9217,BOOK XVI.,"while the Danaans poured after them from their ships, shouting"
9218,BOOK XVI.,"also without ceasing. As when Jove, gatherer of the"
9219,BOOK XVI.,"thunder-cloud, spreads a dense canopy on the top of some lofty"
9220,BOOK XVI.,"mountain, and all the peaks, the jutting headlands, and forest"
9221,BOOK XVI.,glades show out in the great light that flashes from the bursting
9222,BOOK XVI.,"heavens, even so when the Danaans had now driven back the fire"
9223,BOOK XVI.,"from their ships, they took breath for a little while; but the"
9224,BOOK XVI.,"fury of the fight was not yet over, for the Trojans were not"
9225,BOOK XVI.,"driven back in utter rout, but still gave battle, and were ousted"
9226,BOOK XVI.,from their ground only by sheer fighting.
9227,BOOK XVI.,
9228,BOOK XVI.,"The fight then became more scattered, and the chieftains killed"
9229,BOOK XVI.,one another when and how they could. The valiant son of Menoetius
9230,BOOK XVI.,first drove his spear into the thigh of Areilycus just as he was
9231,BOOK XVI.,"turning round; the point went clean through, and broke the bone"
9232,BOOK XVI.,so that he fell forward. Meanwhile Menelaus struck Thoas in the
9233,BOOK XVI.,"chest, where it was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he"
9234,BOOK XVI.,"fell dead. The son of Phyleus saw Amphiclus about to attack him,"
9235,BOOK XVI.,"and ere he could do so took aim at the upper part of his thigh,"
9236,BOOK XVI.,where the muscles are thicker than in any other part; the spear
9237,BOOK XVI.,"tore through all the sinews of the leg, and his eyes were closed"
9238,BOOK XVI.,"in darkness. Of the sons of Nestor one, Antilochus, speared"
9239,BOOK XVI.,"Atymnius, driving the point of the spear through his throat, and"
9240,BOOK XVI.,down he fell. Maris then sprang on Antilochus in hand-to-hand
9241,BOOK XVI.,"fight to avenge his brother, and bestrode the body spear in hand;"
9242,BOOK XVI.,"but valiant Thrasymedes was too quick for him, and in a moment"
9243,BOOK XVI.,had struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his blow; his
9244,BOOK XVI.,"aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at the root"
9245,BOOK XVI.,"of his arm, and tore them right down to the bone, so he fell"
9246,BOOK XVI.,heavily to the ground and his eyes were closed in darkness. Thus
9247,BOOK XVI.,did these two noble comrades of Sarpedon go down to Erebus slain
9248,BOOK XVI.,by the two sons of Nestor; they were the warrior sons of
9249,BOOK XVI.,"Amisodorus, who had reared the invincible Chimaera, to the bane"
9250,BOOK XVI.,of many. Ajax son of Oileus sprang on Cleobulus and took him
9251,BOOK XVI.,alive as he was entangled in the crush; but he killed him then
9252,BOOK XVI.,and there by a sword-blow on the neck. The sword reeked with his
9253,BOOK XVI.,"blood, while dark death and the strong hand of fate gripped him"
9254,BOOK XVI.,and closed his eyes.
9255,BOOK XVI.,
9256,BOOK XVI.,"Peneleos and Lycon now met in close fight, for they had missed"
9257,BOOK XVI.,each other with their spears. They had both thrown without
9258,BOOK XVI.,"effect, so now they drew their swords. Lycon struck the plumed"
9259,BOOK XVI.,"crest of Peneleos’ helmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while"
9260,BOOK XVI.,Peneleos smote Lycon on the neck under the ear. The blade sank so
9261,BOOK XVI.,"deep that the head was held on by nothing but the skin, and there"
9262,BOOK XVI.,was no more life left in him. Meriones gave chase to Acamas on
9263,BOOK XVI.,foot and caught him up just as he was about to mount his chariot;
9264,BOOK XVI.,he drove a spear through his right shoulder so that he fell
9265,BOOK XVI.,"headlong from the car, and his eyes were closed in darkness."
9266,BOOK XVI.,Idomeneus speared Erymas in the mouth; the bronze point of the
9267,BOOK XVI.,"spear went clean through it beneath the brain, crashing in among"
9268,BOOK XVI.,the white bones and smashing them up. His teeth were all of them
9269,BOOK XVI.,knocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream from both his
9270,BOOK XVI.,"eyes; it also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils, and"
9271,BOOK XVI.,the darkness of death enfolded him round about.
9272,BOOK XVI.,
9273,BOOK XVI.,Thus did these chieftains of the Danaans each of them kill his
9274,BOOK XVI.,"man. As ravening wolves seize on kids or lambs, fastening on them"
9275,BOOK XVI.,when they are alone on the hillsides and have strayed from the
9276,BOOK XVI.,main flock through the carelessness of the shepherd—and when the
9277,BOOK XVI.,wolves see this they pounce upon them at once because they cannot
9278,BOOK XVI.,defend themselves—even so did the Danaans now fall on the
9279,BOOK XVI.,"Trojans, who fled with ill-omened cries in their panic and had no"
9280,BOOK XVI.,more fight left in them.
9281,BOOK XVI.,
9282,BOOK XVI.,"Meanwhile great Ajax kept on trying to drive a spear into Hector,"
9283,BOOK XVI.,but Hector was so skilful that he held his broad shoulders well
9284,BOOK XVI.,"under cover of his ox-hide shield, ever on the look-out for the"
9285,BOOK XVI.,whizzing of the arrows and the heavy thud of the spears. He well
9286,BOOK XVI.,"knew that the fortunes of the day had changed, but still stood"
9287,BOOK XVI.,his ground and tried to protect his comrades.
9288,BOOK XVI.,
9289,BOOK XVI.,"As when a cloud goes up into heaven from Olympus, rising out of a"
9290,BOOK XVI.,clear sky when Jove is brewing a gale—even with such panic
9291,BOOK XVI.,"stricken rout did the Trojans now fly, and there was no order in"
9292,BOOK XVI.,their going. Hector’s fleet horses bore him and his armour out of
9293,BOOK XVI.,"the fight, and he left the Trojan host penned in by the deep"
9294,BOOK XVI.,trench against their will. Many a yoke of horses snapped the pole
9295,BOOK XVI.,of their chariots in the trench and left their master’s car
9296,BOOK XVI.,"behind them. Patroclus gave chase, calling impetuously on the"
9297,BOOK XVI.,"Danaans and full of fury against the Trojans, who, being now no"
9298,BOOK XVI.,"longer in a body, filled all the ways with their cries of panic"
9299,BOOK XVI.,and rout; the air was darkened with the clouds of dust they
9300,BOOK XVI.,"raised, and the horses strained every nerve in their flight from"
9301,BOOK XVI.,the tents and ships towards the city.
9302,BOOK XVI.,
9303,BOOK XVI.,Patroclus kept on heading his horses wherever he saw most men
9304,BOOK XVI.,"flying in confusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots were"
9305,BOOK XVI.,"being smashed in all directions, and many a man came tumbling"
9306,BOOK XVI.,down from his own car to fall beneath the wheels of that of
9307,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus, whose immortal steeds, given by the gods to Peleus,"
9308,BOOK XVI.,sprang over the trench at a bound as they sped onward. He was
9309,BOOK XVI.,"intent on trying to get near Hector, for he had set his heart on"
9310,BOOK XVI.,"spearing him, but Hector’s horses were now hurrying him away. As"
9311,BOOK XVI.,the whole dark earth bows before some tempest on an autumn day
9312,BOOK XVI.,when Jove rains his hardest to punish men for giving crooked
9313,BOOK XVI.,"judgement in their courts, and driving justice therefrom without"
9314,BOOK XVI.,heed to the decrees of heaven—all the rivers run full and the
9315,BOOK XVI.,torrents tear many a new channel as they roar headlong from the
9316,BOOK XVI.,"mountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works of"
9317,BOOK XVI.,men—even such was the stress and strain of the Trojan horses in
9318,BOOK XVI.,their flight.
9319,BOOK XVI.,
9320,BOOK XVI.,Patroclus now cut off the battalions that were nearest to him and
9321,BOOK XVI.,drove them back to the ships. They were doing their best to reach
9322,BOOK XVI.,"the city, but he would not let them, and bore down on them"
9323,BOOK XVI.,between the river and the ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade
9324,BOOK XVI.,did he then avenge. First he hit Pronous with a spear on the
9325,BOOK XVI.,"chest where it was exposed near the rim of his shield, and he"
9326,BOOK XVI.,fell heavily to the ground. Next he sprang on Thestor son of
9327,BOOK XVI.,"Enops, who was sitting all huddled up in his chariot, for he had"
9328,BOOK XVI.,lost his head and the reins had been torn out of his hands.
9329,BOOK XVI.,Patroclus went up to him and drove a spear into his right jaw; he
9330,BOOK XVI.,thus hooked him by the teeth and the spear pulled him over the
9331,BOOK XVI.,"rim of his car, as one who sits at the end of some jutting rock"
9332,BOOK XVI.,and draws a strong fish out of the sea with a hook and a
9333,BOOK XVI.,line—even so with his spear did he pull Thestor all gaping from
9334,BOOK XVI.,his chariot; he then threw him down on his face and he died while
9335,BOOK XVI.,"falling. On this, as Erylaus was on coming to attack him, he"
9336,BOOK XVI.,"struck him full on the head with a stone, and his brains were all"
9337,BOOK XVI.,"battered inside his helmet, whereon he fell headlong to the"
9338,BOOK XVI.,ground and the pangs of death took hold upon him. Then he laid
9339,BOOK XVI.,"low, one after the other, Erymas, Amphoterus, Epaltes,"
9340,BOOK XVI.,"Tlepolemus, Echius son of Damastor, Pyris, Ipheus, Euippus and"
9341,BOOK XVI.,Polymelus son of Argeas.
9342,BOOK XVI.,
9343,BOOK XVI.,"Now when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who wore ungirdled"
9344,BOOK XVI.,"tunics, being overcome by Patroclus son of Menoetius, he rebuked"
9345,BOOK XVI.,"the Lycians saying. “Shame on you, where are you flying to? Show"
9346,BOOK XVI.,your mettle; I will myself meet this man in fight and learn who
9347,BOOK XVI.,"it is that is so masterful; he has done us much hurt, and has"
9348,BOOK XVI.,stretched many a brave man upon the ground.”
9349,BOOK XVI.,
9350,BOOK XVI.,"He sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and Patroclus, when he"
9351,BOOK XVI.,"saw this, leaped on to the ground also. The two then rushed at"
9352,BOOK XVI.,one another with loud cries like eagle-beaked crook-taloned
9353,BOOK XVI.,vultures that scream and tear at one another in some high
9354,BOOK XVI.,mountain fastness.
9355,BOOK XVI.,
9356,BOOK XVI.,The son of scheming Saturn looked down upon them in pity and said
9357,BOOK XVI.,"to Juno who was his wife and sister, “Alas, that it should be the"
9358,BOOK XVI.,lot of Sarpedon whom I love so dearly to perish by the hand of
9359,BOOK XVI.,Patroclus. I am in two minds whether to catch him up out of the
9360,BOOK XVI.,fight and set him down safe and sound in the fertile land of
9361,BOOK XVI.,"Lycia, or to let him now fall by the hand of the son of"
9362,BOOK XVI.,Menoetius.”
9363,BOOK XVI.,
9364,BOOK XVI.,"And Juno answered, “Most dread son of Saturn, what is this that"
9365,BOOK XVI.,"you are saying? Would you snatch a mortal man, whose doom has"
9366,BOOK XVI.,"long been fated, out of the jaws of death? Do as you will, but we"
9367,BOOK XVI.,"shall not all of us be of your mind. I say further, and lay my"
9368,BOOK XVI.,"saying to your heart, that if you send Sarpedon safely to his own"
9369,BOOK XVI.,"home, some other of the gods will be also wanting to escort his"
9370,BOOK XVI.,"son out of battle, for there are many sons of gods fighting round"
9371,BOOK XVI.,"the city of Troy, and you will make every one jealous. If,"
9372,BOOK XVI.,"however, you are fond of him and pity him, let him indeed fall by"
9373,BOOK XVI.,"the hand of Patroclus, but as soon as the life is gone out of"
9374,BOOK XVI.,"him, send Death and sweet Sleep to bear him off the field and"
9375,BOOK XVI.,"take him to the broad lands of Lycia, where his brothers and his"
9376,BOOK XVI.,"kinsmen will bury him with mound and pillar, in due honour to the"
9377,BOOK XVI.,dead.”
9378,BOOK XVI.,
9379,BOOK XVI.,"The sire of gods and men assented, but he shed a rain of blood"
9380,BOOK XVI.,upon the earth in honour of his son whom Patroclus was about to
9381,BOOK XVI.,kill on the rich plain of Troy far from his home.
9382,BOOK XVI.,
9383,BOOK XVI.,When they were now come close to one another Patroclus struck
9384,BOOK XVI.,"Thrasydemus, the brave squire of Sarpedon, in the lower part of"
9385,BOOK XVI.,"the belly, and killed him. Sarpedon then aimed a spear at"
9386,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus and missed him, but he struck the horse Pedasus in the"
9387,BOOK XVI.,"right shoulder, and it screamed aloud as it lay, groaning in the"
9388,BOOK XVI.,dust until the life went out of it. The other two horses began to
9389,BOOK XVI.,plunge; the pole of the chariot cracked and they got entangled in
9390,BOOK XVI.,the reins through the fall of the horse that was yoked along with
9391,BOOK XVI.,them; but Automedon knew what to do; without the loss of a moment
9392,BOOK XVI.,he drew the keen blade that hung by his sturdy thigh and cut the
9393,BOOK XVI.,"third horse adrift; whereon the other two righted themselves, and"
9394,BOOK XVI.,pulling hard at the reins again went together into battle.
9395,BOOK XVI.,
9396,BOOK XVI.,"Sarpedon now took a second aim at Patroclus, and again missed"
9397,BOOK XVI.,"him, the point of the spear passed over his left shoulder without"
9398,BOOK XVI.,"hitting him. Patroclus then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped"
9399,BOOK XVI.,"not from his hand in vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where the"
9400,BOOK XVI.,midriff surrounds the ever-beating heart. He fell like some oak
9401,BOOK XVI.,or silver poplar or tall pine to which woodmen have laid their
9402,BOOK XVI.,axes upon the mountains to make timber for ship-building—even so
9403,BOOK XVI.,did he lie stretched at full length in front of his chariot and
9404,BOOK XVI.,"horses, moaning and clutching at the blood-stained dust. As when"
9405,BOOK XVI.,a lion springs with a bound upon a herd of cattle and fastens on
9406,BOOK XVI.,a great black bull which dies bellowing in its clutches—even so
9407,BOOK XVI.,did the leader of the Lycian warriors struggle in death as he
9408,BOOK XVI.,fell by the hand of Patroclus. He called on his trusty comrade
9409,BOOK XVI.,"and said, “Glaucus, my brother, hero among heroes, put forth all"
9410,BOOK XVI.,"your strength, fight with might and main, now if ever quit"
9411,BOOK XVI.,yourself like a valiant soldier. First go about among the Lycian
9412,BOOK XVI.,captains and bid them fight for Sarpedon; then yourself also do
9413,BOOK XVI.,battle to save my armour from being taken. My name will haunt you
9414,BOOK XVI.,henceforth and for ever if the Achaeans rob me of my armour now
9415,BOOK XVI.,that I have fallen at their ships. Do your very utmost and call
9416,BOOK XVI.,all my people together.”
9417,BOOK XVI.,
9418,BOOK XVI.,Death closed his eyes as he spoke. Patroclus planted his heel on
9419,BOOK XVI.,"his breast and drew the spear from his body, whereon his senses"
9420,BOOK XVI.,"came out along with it, and he drew out both spear-point and"
9421,BOOK XVI.,Sarpedon’s soul at the same time. Hard by the Myrmidons held his
9422,BOOK XVI.,"snorting steeds, who were wild with panic at finding themselves"
9423,BOOK XVI.,deserted by their lords.
9424,BOOK XVI.,
9425,BOOK XVI.,"Glaucus was overcome with grief when he heard what Sarpedon said,"
9426,BOOK XVI.,for he could not help him. He had to support his arm with his
9427,BOOK XVI.,"other hand, being in great pain through the wound which Teucer’s"
9428,BOOK XVI.,"arrow had given him when Teucer was defending the wall as he,"
9429,BOOK XVI.,"Glaucus, was assailing it. Therefore he prayed to far-darting"
9430,BOOK XVI.,"Apollo saying, “Hear me O king from your seat, may be in the rich"
9431,BOOK XVI.,"land of Lycia, or may be in Troy, for in all places you can hear"
9432,BOOK XVI.,"the prayer of one who is in distress, as I now am. I have a"
9433,BOOK XVI.,"grievous wound; my hand is aching with pain, there is no"
9434,BOOK XVI.,"staunching the blood, and my whole arm drags by reason of my"
9435,BOOK XVI.,"hurt, so that I cannot grasp my sword nor go among my foes and"
9436,BOOK XVI.,"fight them, though our prince, Jove’s son Sarpedon, is slain."
9437,BOOK XVI.,"Jove defended not his son, do you, therefore, O king, heal me of"
9438,BOOK XVI.,"my wound, ease my pain and grant me strength both to cheer on the"
9439,BOOK XVI.,Lycians and to fight along with them round the body of him who
9440,BOOK XVI.,has fallen.”
9441,BOOK XVI.,
9442,BOOK XVI.,"Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He eased his pain,"
9443,BOOK XVI.,"staunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new"
9444,BOOK XVI.,"strength. Glaucus perceived this, and was thankful that the"
9445,BOOK XVI.,"mighty god had answered his prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went"
9446,BOOK XVI.,"among the Lycian captains, and bade them come to fight about the"
9447,BOOK XVI.,body of Sarpedon. From these he strode on among the Trojans to
9448,BOOK XVI.,Polydamas son of Panthous and Agenor; he then went in search of
9449,BOOK XVI.,"Aeneas and Hector, and when he had found them he said, “Hector,"
9450,BOOK XVI.,"you have utterly forgotten your allies, who languish here for"
9451,BOOK XVI.,your sake far from friends and home while you do nothing to
9452,BOOK XVI.,support them. Sarpedon leader of the Lycian warriors has
9453,BOOK XVI.,fallen—he who was at once the right and might of Lycia; Mars has
9454,BOOK XVI.,"laid him low by the spear of Patroclus. Stand by him, my friends,"
9455,BOOK XVI.,"and suffer not the Myrmidons to strip him of his armour, nor to"
9456,BOOK XVI.,treat his body with contumely in revenge for all the Danaans whom
9457,BOOK XVI.,we have speared at the ships.”
9458,BOOK XVI.,
9459,BOOK XVI.,As he spoke the Trojans were plunged in extreme and ungovernable
9460,BOOK XVI.,"grief; for Sarpedon, alien though he was, had been one of the"
9461,BOOK XVI.,"main stays of their city, both as having much people with him,"
9462,BOOK XVI.,"and himself the foremost among them all. Led by Hector, who was"
9463,BOOK XVI.,"infuriated by the fall of Sarpedon, they made instantly for the"
9464,BOOK XVI.,"Danaans with all their might, while the undaunted spirit of"
9465,BOOK XVI.,Patroclus son of Menoetius cheered on the Achaeans. First he
9466,BOOK XVI.,"spoke to the two Ajaxes, men who needed no bidding. “Ajaxes,”"
9467,BOOK XVI.,"said he, “may it now please you to show yourselves the men you"
9468,BOOK XVI.,"have always been, or even better—Sarpedon is fallen—he who was"
9469,BOOK XVI.,first to overleap the wall of the Achaeans; let us take the body
9470,BOOK XVI.,"and outrage it; let us strip the armour from his shoulders, and"
9471,BOOK XVI.,kill his comrades if they try to rescue his body.”
9472,BOOK XVI.,
9473,BOOK XVI.,"He spoke to men who of themselves were full eager; both sides,"
9474,BOOK XVI.,"therefore, the Trojans and Lycians on the one hand, and the"
9475,BOOK XVI.,"Myrmidons and Achaeans on the other, strengthened their"
9476,BOOK XVI.,"battalions, and fought desperately about the body of Sarpedon,"
9477,BOOK XVI.,shouting fiercely the while. Mighty was the din of their armour
9478,BOOK XVI.,"as they came together, and Jove shed a thick darkness over the"
9479,BOOK XVI.,"fight, to increase the toil of the battle over the body of his"
9480,BOOK XVI.,son.
9481,BOOK XVI.,
9482,BOOK XVI.,"At first the Trojans made some headway against the Achaeans, for"
9483,BOOK XVI.,"one of the best men among the Myrmidons was killed, Epeigeus, son"
9484,BOOK XVI.,of noble Agacles who had erewhile been king in the good city of
9485,BOOK XVI.,"Budeum; but presently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his"
9486,BOOK XVI.,"own, he took refuge with Peleus and Thetis, who sent him to Ilius"
9487,BOOK XVI.,the land of noble steeds to fight the Trojans under Achilles.
9488,BOOK XVI.,Hector now struck him on the head with a stone just as he had
9489,BOOK XVI.,"caught hold of the body, and his brains inside his helmet were"
9490,BOOK XVI.,"all battered in, so that he fell face foremost upon the body of"
9491,BOOK XVI.,"Sarpedon, and there died. Patroclus was enraged by the death of"
9492,BOOK XVI.,"his comrade, and sped through the front ranks as swiftly as a"
9493,BOOK XVI.,hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings. Even so
9494,BOOK XVI.,"swiftly, O noble knight Patroclus, did you make straight for the"
9495,BOOK XVI.,Lycians and Trojans to avenge your comrade. Forthwith he struck
9496,BOOK XVI.,"Sthenelaus the son of Ithaemenes on the neck with a stone, and"
9497,BOOK XVI.,broke the tendons that join it to the head and spine. On this
9498,BOOK XVI.,Hector and the front rank of his men gave ground. As far as a man
9499,BOOK XVI.,"can throw a javelin when competing for some prize, or even in"
9500,BOOK XVI.,battle—so far did the Trojans now retreat before the Achaeans.
9501,BOOK XVI.,"Glaucus, captain of the Lycians, was the first to rally them, by"
9502,BOOK XVI.,killing Bathycles son of Chalcon who lived in Hellas and was the
9503,BOOK XVI.,"richest man among the Myrmidons. Glaucus turned round suddenly,"
9504,BOOK XVI.,just as Bathycles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of
9505,BOOK XVI.,"him, and drove his spear right into the middle of his chest,"
9506,BOOK XVI.,"whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and the fall of so good a"
9507,BOOK XVI.,"man filled the Achaeans with dismay, while the Trojans were"
9508,BOOK XVI.,"exultant, and came up in a body round the corpse. Nevertheless"
9509,BOOK XVI.,"the Achaeans, mindful of their prowess, bore straight down upon"
9510,BOOK XVI.,them.
9511,BOOK XVI.,
9512,BOOK XVI.,"Meriones then killed a helmed warrior of the Trojans, Laogonus"
9513,BOOK XVI.,"son of Onetor, who was priest of Jove of Mt. Ida, and was"
9514,BOOK XVI.,honoured by the people as though he were a god. Meriones struck
9515,BOOK XVI.,"him under the jaw and ear, so that life went out of him and the"
9516,BOOK XVI.,darkness of death laid hold upon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear
9517,BOOK XVI.,"at Meriones, hoping to hit him under the shield as he was"
9518,BOOK XVI.,"advancing, but Meriones saw it coming and stooped forward to"
9519,BOOK XVI.,"avoid it, whereon the spear flew past him and the point stuck in"
9520,BOOK XVI.,"the ground, while the butt-end went on quivering till Mars robbed"
9521,BOOK XVI.,"it of its force. The spear, therefore, sped from Aeneas’s hand in"
9522,BOOK XVI.,"vain and fell quivering to the ground. Aeneas was angry and said,"
9523,BOOK XVI.,"“Meriones, you are a good dancer, but if I had hit you my spear"
9524,BOOK XVI.,would soon have made an end of you.”
9525,BOOK XVI.,
9526,BOOK XVI.,"And Meriones answered, “Aeneas, for all your bravery, you will"
9527,BOOK XVI.,not be able to make an end of every one who comes against you.
9528,BOOK XVI.,"You are only a mortal like myself, and if I were to hit you in"
9529,BOOK XVI.,"the middle of your shield with my spear, however strong and"
9530,BOOK XVI.,"self-confident you may be, I should soon vanquish you, and you"
9531,BOOK XVI.,would yield your life to Hades of the noble steeds.”
9532,BOOK XVI.,
9533,BOOK XVI.,"On this the son of Menoetius rebuked him and said, “Meriones,"
9534,BOOK XVI.,"hero though you be, you should not speak thus; taunting speeches,"
9535,BOOK XVI.,"my good friend, will not make the Trojans draw away from the dead"
9536,BOOK XVI.,"body; some of them must go under ground first; blows for battle,"
9537,BOOK XVI.,"and words for council; fight, therefore, and say nothing.”"
9538,BOOK XVI.,
9539,BOOK XVI.,He led the way as he spoke and the hero went forward with him. As
9540,BOOK XVI.,the sound of woodcutters in some forest glade upon the
9541,BOOK XVI.,mountains—and the thud of their axes is heard afar—even such a
9542,BOOK XVI.,din now rose from earth-clash of bronze armour and of good
9543,BOOK XVI.,"ox-hide shields, as men smote each other with their swords and"
9544,BOOK XVI.,spears pointed at both ends. A man had need of good eyesight now
9545,BOOK XVI.,"to know Sarpedon, so covered was he from head to foot with spears"
9546,BOOK XVI.,"and blood and dust. Men swarmed about the body, as flies that"
9547,BOOK XVI.,buzz round the full milk-pails in spring when they are brimming
9548,BOOK XVI.,with milk—even so did they gather round Sarpedon; nor did Jove
9549,BOOK XVI.,"turn his keen eyes away for one moment from the fight, but kept"
9550,BOOK XVI.,"looking at it all the time, for he was settling how best to kill"
9551,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus, and considering whether Hector should be allowed to"
9552,BOOK XVI.,"end him now in the fight round the body of Sarpedon, and strip"
9553,BOOK XVI.,"him of his armour, or whether he should let him give yet further"
9554,BOOK XVI.,"trouble to the Trojans. In the end, he deemed it best that the"
9555,BOOK XVI.,brave squire of Achilles son of Peleus should drive Hector and
9556,BOOK XVI.,the Trojans back towards the city and take the lives of many.
9557,BOOK XVI.,"First, therefore, he made Hector turn fainthearted, whereon he"
9558,BOOK XVI.,"mounted his chariot and fled, bidding the other Trojans fly also,"
9559,BOOK XVI.,for he saw that the scales of Jove had turned against him.
9560,BOOK XVI.,Neither would the brave Lycians stand firm; they were dismayed
9561,BOOK XVI.,when they saw their king lying struck to the heart amid a heap of
9562,BOOK XVI.,corpses—for when the son of Saturn made the fight wax hot many
9563,BOOK XVI.,"had fallen above him. The Achaeans, therefore stripped the"
9564,BOOK XVI.,gleaming armour from his shoulders and the brave son of Menoetius
9565,BOOK XVI.,gave it to his men to take to the ships. Then Jove lord of the
9566,BOOK XVI.,"storm-cloud said to Apollo, “Dear Phoebus, go, I pray you, and"
9567,BOOK XVI.,take Sarpedon out of range of the weapons; cleanse the black
9568,BOOK XVI.,"blood from off him, and then bear him a long way off where you"
9569,BOOK XVI.,"may wash him in the river, anoint him with ambrosia, and clothe"
9570,BOOK XVI.,"him in immortal raiment; this done, commit him to the arms of the"
9571,BOOK XVI.,"two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who will carry him"
9572,BOOK XVI.,"straightway to the rich land of Lycia, where his brothers and"
9573,BOOK XVI.,"kinsmen will inter him, and will raise both mound and pillar to"
9574,BOOK XVI.,"his memory, in due honour to the dead.”"
9575,BOOK XVI.,
9576,BOOK XVI.,"Thus he spoke. Apollo obeyed his father’s saying, and came down"
9577,BOOK XVI.,from the heights of Ida into the thick of the fight; forthwith he
9578,BOOK XVI.,"took Sarpedon out of range of the weapons, and then bore him a"
9579,BOOK XVI.,"long way off, where he washed him in the river, anointed him with"
9580,BOOK XVI.,"ambrosia and clothed him in immortal raiment; this done, he"
9581,BOOK XVI.,"committed him to the arms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and"
9582,BOOK XVI.,"Sleep, who presently set him down in the rich land of Lycia."
9583,BOOK XVI.,
9584,BOOK XVI.,"Meanwhile Patroclus, with many a shout to his horses and to"
9585,BOOK XVI.,"Automedon, pursued the Trojans and Lycians in the pride and"
9586,BOOK XVI.,foolishness of his heart. Had he but obeyed the bidding of the
9587,BOOK XVI.,"son of Peleus, he would have escaped death and have been"
9588,BOOK XVI.,scatheless; but the counsels of Jove pass man’s understanding; he
9589,BOOK XVI.,will put even a brave man to flight and snatch victory from his
9590,BOOK XVI.,"grasp, or again he will set him on to fight, as he now did when"
9591,BOOK XVI.,he put a high spirit into the heart of Patroclus.
9592,BOOK XVI.,
9593,BOOK XVI.,"Who then first, and who last, was slain by you, O Patroclus, when"
9594,BOOK XVI.,"the gods had now called you to meet your doom? First Adrestus,"
9595,BOOK XVI.,"Autonous, Echeclus, Perimus the son of Megas, Epistor and"
9596,BOOK XVI.,"Melanippus; after these he killed Elasus, Mulius, and Pylartes."
9597,BOOK XVI.,"These he slew, but the rest saved themselves by flight."
9598,BOOK XVI.,
9599,BOOK XVI.,The sons of the Achaeans would now have taken Troy by the hands
9600,BOOK XVI.,"of Patroclus, for his spear flew in all directions, had not"
9601,BOOK XVI.,Phoebus Apollo taken his stand upon the wall to defeat his
9602,BOOK XVI.,purpose and to aid the Trojans. Thrice did Patroclus charge at an
9603,BOOK XVI.,"angle of the high wall, and thrice did Apollo beat him back,"
9604,BOOK XVI.,striking his shield with his own immortal hands. When Patroclus
9605,BOOK XVI.,"was coming on like a god for yet a fourth time, Apollo shouted to"
9606,BOOK XVI.,"him with an awful voice and said, “Draw back, noble Patroclus, it"
9607,BOOK XVI.,"is not your lot to sack the city of the Trojan chieftains, nor"
9608,BOOK XVI.,yet will it be that of Achilles who is a far better man than you
9609,BOOK XVI.,"are.” On hearing this, Patroclus withdrew to some distance and"
9610,BOOK XVI.,avoided the anger of Apollo.
9611,BOOK XVI.,
9612,BOOK XVI.,Meanwhile Hector was waiting with his horses inside the Scaean
9613,BOOK XVI.,"gates, in doubt whether to drive out again and go on fighting, or"
9614,BOOK XVI.,to call the army inside the gates. As he was thus doubting
9615,BOOK XVI.,Phoebus Apollo drew near him in the likeness of a young and lusty
9616,BOOK XVI.,"warrior Asius, who was Hector’s uncle, being own brother to"
9617,BOOK XVI.,"Hecuba, and son of Dymas who lived in Phrygia by the waters of"
9618,BOOK XVI.,the river Sangarius; in his likeness Jove’s son Apollo now spoke
9619,BOOK XVI.,"to Hector saying, “Hector, why have you left off fighting? It is"
9620,BOOK XVI.,"ill done of you. If I were as much better a man than you, as I am"
9621,BOOK XVI.,"worse, you should soon rue your slackness. Drive straight towards"
9622,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus, if so be that Apollo may grant you a triumph over him,"
9623,BOOK XVI.,and you may rule him.”
9624,BOOK XVI.,
9625,BOOK XVI.,"With this the god went back into the hurly-burly, and Hector bade"
9626,BOOK XVI.,Cebriones drive again into the fight. Apollo passed in among
9627,BOOK XVI.,"them, and struck panic into the Argives, while he gave triumph to"
9628,BOOK XVI.,Hector and the Trojans. Hector let the other Danaans alone and
9629,BOOK XVI.,"killed no man, but drove straight at Patroclus. Patroclus then"
9630,BOOK XVI.,"sprang from his chariot to the ground, with a spear in his left"
9631,BOOK XVI.,"hand, and in his right a jagged stone as large as his hand could"
9632,BOOK XVI.,"hold. He stood still and threw it, nor did it go far without"
9633,BOOK XVI.,"hitting some one; the cast was not in vain, for the stone struck"
9634,BOOK XVI.,"Cebriones, Hector’s charioteer, a bastard son of Priam, as he"
9635,BOOK XVI.,held the reins in his hands. The stone hit him on the forehead
9636,BOOK XVI.,"and drove his brows into his head for the bone was smashed, and"
9637,BOOK XVI.,his eyes fell to the ground at his feet. He dropped dead from his
9638,BOOK XVI.,"chariot as though he were diving, and there was no more life left"
9639,BOOK XVI.,"in him. Over him did you then vaunt, O knight Patroclus, saying,"
9640,BOOK XVI.,"“Bless my heart, how active he is, and how well he dives. If we"
9641,BOOK XVI.,had been at sea this fellow would have dived from the ship’s side
9642,BOOK XVI.,"and brought up as many oysters as the whole crew could stomach,"
9643,BOOK XVI.,"even in rough water, for he has dived beautifully off his chariot"
9644,BOOK XVI.,"on to the ground. It seems, then, that there are divers also"
9645,BOOK XVI.,among the Trojans.”
9646,BOOK XVI.,
9647,BOOK XVI.,"As he spoke he flung himself on Cebriones with the spring, as it"
9648,BOOK XVI.,"were, of a lion that while attacking a stockyard is himself"
9649,BOOK XVI.,"struck in the chest, and his courage is his own bane—even so"
9650,BOOK XVI.,"furiously, O Patroclus, did you then spring upon Cebriones."
9651,BOOK XVI.,Hector sprang also from his chariot to the ground. The pair then
9652,BOOK XVI.,fought over the body of Cebriones. As two lions fight fiercely on
9653,BOOK XVI.,"some high mountain over the body of a stag that they have killed,"
9654,BOOK XVI.,"even so did these two mighty warriors, Patroclus son of Menoetius"
9655,BOOK XVI.,"and brave Hector, hack and hew at one another over the corpse of"
9656,BOOK XVI.,Cebriones. Hector would not let him go when he had once got him
9657,BOOK XVI.,"by the head, while Patroclus kept fast hold of his feet, and a"
9658,BOOK XVI.,fierce fight raged between the other Danaans and Trojans. As the
9659,BOOK XVI.,east and south wind buffet one another when they beat upon some
9660,BOOK XVI.,dense forest on the mountains—there is beech and ash and
9661,BOOK XVI.,spreading cornel; the top of the trees roar as they beat on one
9662,BOOK XVI.,"another, and one can hear the boughs cracking and breaking—even"
9663,BOOK XVI.,so did the Trojans and Achaeans spring upon one another and lay
9664,BOOK XVI.,"about each other, and neither side would give way. Many a pointed"
9665,BOOK XVI.,spear fell to ground and many a winged arrow sped from its
9666,BOOK XVI.,"bowstring about the body of Cebriones; many a great stone,"
9667,BOOK XVI.,"moreover, beat on many a shield as they fought around his body,"
9668,BOOK XVI.,"but there he lay in the whirling clouds of dust, all huge and"
9669,BOOK XVI.,"hugely, heedless of his driving now."
9670,BOOK XVI.,
9671,BOOK XVI.,So long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven the weapons of
9672,BOOK XVI.,"either side were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he"
9673,BOOK XVI.,"went down towards the time when men loose their oxen, the"
9674,BOOK XVI.,"Achaeans proved to be beyond all forecast stronger, so that they"
9675,BOOK XVI.,drew Cebriones out of range of the darts and tumult of the
9676,BOOK XVI.,"Trojans, and stripped the armour from his shoulders. Then"
9677,BOOK XVI.,Patroclus sprang like Mars with fierce intent and a terrific
9678,BOOK XVI.,"shout upon the Trojans, and thrice did he kill nine men; but as"
9679,BOOK XVI.,"he was coming on like a god for a time, then, O Patroclus, was"
9680,BOOK XVI.,"the hour of your end approaching, for Phoebus fought you in fell"
9681,BOOK XVI.,earnest. Patroclus did not see him as he moved about in the
9682,BOOK XVI.,"crush, for he was enshrouded in thick darkness, and the god"
9683,BOOK XVI.,struck him from behind on his back and his broad shoulders with
9684,BOOK XVI.,"the flat of his hand, so that his eyes turned dizzy. Phoebus"
9685,BOOK XVI.,"Apollo beat the helmet from off his head, and it rolled rattling"
9686,BOOK XVI.,"off under the horses’ feet, where its horse-hair plumes were all"
9687,BOOK XVI.,begrimed with dust and blood. Never indeed had that helmet fared
9688,BOOK XVI.,"so before, for it had served to protect the head and comely"
9689,BOOK XVI.,"forehead of the godlike hero Achilles. Now, however, Zeus"
9690,BOOK XVI.,delivered it over to be worn by Hector. Nevertheless the end of
9691,BOOK XVI.,"Hector also was near. The bronze-shod spear, so great and so"
9692,BOOK XVI.,"strong, was broken in the hand of Patroclus, while his shield"
9693,BOOK XVI.,that covered him from head to foot fell to the ground as did also
9694,BOOK XVI.,"the band that held it, and Apollo undid the fastenings of his"
9695,BOOK XVI.,corslet.
9696,BOOK XVI.,
9697,BOOK XVI.,"On this his mind became clouded; his limbs failed him, and he"
9698,BOOK XVI.,stood as one dazed; whereon Euphorbus son of Panthous a
9699,BOOK XVI.,"Dardanian, the best spearman of his time, as also the finest"
9700,BOOK XVI.,"horseman and fleetest runner, came behind him and struck him in"
9701,BOOK XVI.,"the back with a spear, midway between the shoulders. This man as"
9702,BOOK XVI.,soon as ever he had come up with his chariot had dismounted
9703,BOOK XVI.,"twenty men, so proficient was he in all the arts of war—he it"
9704,BOOK XVI.,"was, O knight Patroclus, that first drove a weapon into you, but"
9705,BOOK XVI.,he did not quite overpower you. Euphorbus then ran back into the
9706,BOOK XVI.,"crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of the wound; he would"
9707,BOOK XVI.,"not stand firm and wait for Patroclus, unarmed though he now was,"
9708,BOOK XVI.,"to attack him; but Patroclus unnerved, alike by the blow the god"
9709,BOOK XVI.,"had given him and by the spear-wound, drew back under cover of"
9710,BOOK XVI.,"his men in fear for his life. Hector on this, seeing him to be"
9711,BOOK XVI.,"wounded and giving ground, forced his way through the ranks, and"
9712,BOOK XVI.,when close up with him struck him in the lower part of the belly
9713,BOOK XVI.,"with a spear, driving the bronze point right through it, so that"
9714,BOOK XVI.,he fell heavily to the ground to the great grief of the Achaeans.
9715,BOOK XVI.,As when a lion has fought some fierce wild boar and worsted
9716,BOOK XVI.,him—the two fight furiously upon the mountains over some little
9717,BOOK XVI.,"fountain at which they would both drink, and the lion has beaten"
9718,BOOK XVI.,the boar till he can hardly breathe—even so did Hector son of
9719,BOOK XVI.,Priam take the life of the brave son of Menoetius who had killed
9720,BOOK XVI.,"so many, striking him from close at hand, and vaunting over him"
9721,BOOK XVI.,"the while. “Patroclus,” said he, “you deemed that you should sack"
9722,BOOK XVI.,"our city, rob our Trojan women of their freedom, and carry them"
9723,BOOK XVI.,off in your ships to your own country. Fool; Hector and his fleet
9724,BOOK XVI.,horses were ever straining their utmost to defend them. I am
9725,BOOK XVI.,foremost of all the Trojan warriors to stave the day of bondage
9726,BOOK XVI.,"from off them; as for you, vultures shall devour you here. Poor"
9727,BOOK XVI.,"wretch, Achilles with all his bravery availed you nothing; and"
9728,BOOK XVI.,"yet I ween when you left him he charged you straitly saying,"
9729,BOOK XVI.,"‘Come not back to the ships, knight Patroclus, till you have rent"
9730,BOOK XVI.,the blood-stained shirt of murderous Hector about his body.’ Thus
9731,BOOK XVI.,"I ween did he charge you, and your fool’s heart answered him"
9732,BOOK XVI.,‘yea’ within you.”
9733,BOOK XVI.,
9734,BOOK XVI.,"Then, as the life ebbed out of you, you answered, O knight"
9735,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus: “Hector, vaunt as you will, for Jove the son of Saturn"
9736,BOOK XVI.,and Apollo have vouchsafed you victory; it is they who have
9737,BOOK XVI.,"vanquished me so easily, and they who have stripped the armour"
9738,BOOK XVI.,"from my shoulders; had twenty such men as you attacked me, all of"
9739,BOOK XVI.,them would have fallen before my spear. Fate and the son of Leto
9740,BOOK XVI.,"have overpowered me, and among mortal men Euphorbus; you are"
9741,BOOK XVI.,"yourself third only in the killing of me. I say further, and lay"
9742,BOOK XVI.,"my saying to your heart, you too shall live but for a little"
9743,BOOK XVI.,"season; death and the day of your doom are close upon you, and"
9744,BOOK XVI.,they will lay you low by the hand of Achilles son of Aeacus.”
9745,BOOK XVI.,
9746,BOOK XVI.,"When he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in death, his soul"
9747,BOOK XVI.,"left his body and flitted down to the house of Hades, mourning"
9748,BOOK XVI.,its sad fate and bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its
9749,BOOK XVI.,"manhood. Dead though he was, Hector still spoke to him saying,"
9750,BOOK XVI.,"“Patroclus, why should you thus foretell my doom? Who knows but"
9751,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles, son of lovely Thetis, may be smitten by my spear and"
9752,BOOK XVI.,die before me?”
9753,BOOK XVI.,
9754,BOOK XVI.,"As he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the wound, planting his"
9755,BOOK XVI.,"foot upon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its back."
9756,BOOK XVI.,"He then went spear in hand after Automedon, squire of the fleet"
9757,BOOK XVI.,"descendant of Aeacus, for he longed to lay him low, but the"
9758,BOOK XVI.,immortal steeds which the gods had given as a rich gift to Peleus
9759,BOOK XVI.,bore him swiftly from the field.

9767,BOOK XVII.,The fight around the body of Patroclus.
9768,BOOK XVII.,
9769,BOOK XVII.,Brave Menelaus son of Atreus now came to know that Patroclus had
9770,BOOK XVII.,"fallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in full"
9771,BOOK XVII.,armour to bestride him. As a cow stands lowing over her first
9772,BOOK XVII.,"calf, even so did yellow-haired Menelaus bestride Patroclus. He"
9773,BOOK XVII.,"held his round shield and his spear in front of him, resolute to"
9774,BOOK XVII.,kill any who should dare face him. But the son of Panthous had
9775,BOOK XVII.,"also noted the body, and came up to Menelaus saying, “Menelaus,"
9776,BOOK XVII.,"son of Atreus, draw back, leave the body, and let the"
9777,BOOK XVII.,blood-stained spoils be. I was first of the Trojans and their
9778,BOOK XVII.,"brave allies to drive my spear into Patroclus, let me, therefore,"
9779,BOOK XVII.,"have my full glory among the Trojans, or I will take aim and kill"
9780,BOOK XVII.,you.”
9781,BOOK XVII.,
9782,BOOK XVII.,"To this Menelaus answered in great anger “By father Jove,"
9783,BOOK XVII.,"boasting is an ill thing. The pard is not more bold, nor the lion"
9784,BOOK XVII.,"nor savage wild boar, which is fiercest and most dauntless of all"
9785,BOOK XVII.,"creatures, than are the proud sons of Panthous. Yet Hyperenor did"
9786,BOOK XVII.,not see out the days of his youth when he made light of me and
9787,BOOK XVII.,"withstood me, deeming me the meanest soldier among the Danaans."
9788,BOOK XVII.,His own feet never bore him back to gladden his wife and parents.
9789,BOOK XVII.,"Even so shall I make an end of you too, if you withstand me; get"
9790,BOOK XVII.,"you back into the crowd and do not face me, or it shall be worse"
9791,BOOK XVII.,for you. Even a fool may be wise after the event.”
9792,BOOK XVII.,
9793,BOOK XVII.,"Euphorbus would not listen, and said, “Now indeed, Menelaus,"
9794,BOOK XVII.,"shall you pay for the death of my brother over whom you vaunted,"
9795,BOOK XVII.,"and whose wife you widowed in her bridal chamber, while you"
9796,BOOK XVII.,brought grief unspeakable on his parents. I shall comfort these
9797,BOOK XVII.,poor people if I bring your head and armour and place them in the
9798,BOOK XVII.,hands of Panthous and noble Phrontis. The time is come when this
9799,BOOK XVII.,"matter shall be fought out and settled, for me or against me.”"
9800,BOOK XVII.,
9801,BOOK XVII.,"As he spoke he struck Menelaus full on the shield, but the spear"
9802,BOOK XVII.,"did not go through, for the shield turned its point. Menelaus"
9803,BOOK XVII.,"then took aim, praying to father Jove as he did so; Euphorbus was"
9804,BOOK XVII.,"drawing back, and Menelaus struck him about the roots of his"
9805,BOOK XVII.,"throat, leaning his whole weight on the spear, so as to drive it"
9806,BOOK XVII.,"home. The point went clean through his neck, and his armour rang"
9807,BOOK XVII.,rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. His hair
9808,BOOK XVII.,"which was like that of the Graces, and his locks so deftly bound"
9809,BOOK XVII.,"in bands of silver and gold, were all bedrabbled with blood. As"
9810,BOOK XVII.,one who has grown a fine young olive tree in a clear space where
9811,BOOK XVII.,"there is abundance of water—the plant is full of promise, and"
9812,BOOK XVII.,though the winds beat upon it from every quarter it puts forth
9813,BOOK XVII.,its white blossoms till the blasts of some fierce hurricane sweep
9814,BOOK XVII.,down upon it and level it with the ground—even so did Menelaus
9815,BOOK XVII.,strip the fair youth Euphorbus of his armour after he had slain
9816,BOOK XVII.,him. Or as some fierce lion upon the mountains in the pride of
9817,BOOK XVII.,his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd as it is
9818,BOOK XVII.,"feeding—first he breaks her neck with his strong jaws, and then"
9819,BOOK XVII.,gorges on her blood and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue
9820,BOOK XVII.,"and cry against him, but they stand aloof and will not come close"
9821,BOOK XVII.,"to him, for they are pale with fear—even so no one had the"
9822,BOOK XVII.,courage to face valiant Menelaus. The son of Atreus would have
9823,BOOK XVII.,"then carried off the armour of the son of Panthous with ease, had"
9824,BOOK XVII.,"not Phoebus Apollo been angry, and in the guise of Mentes chief"
9825,BOOK XVII.,"of the Cicons incited Hector to attack him. “Hector,” said he,"
9826,BOOK XVII.,"“you are now going after the horses of the noble son of Aeacus,"
9827,BOOK XVII.,but you will not take them; they cannot be kept in hand and
9828,BOOK XVII.,"driven by mortal man, save only by Achilles, who is son to an"
9829,BOOK XVII.,immortal mother. Meanwhile Menelaus son of Atreus has bestridden
9830,BOOK XVII.,"the body of Patroclus and killed the noblest of the Trojans,"
9831,BOOK XVII.,"Euphorbus son of Panthous, so that he can fight no more.”"
9832,BOOK XVII.,
9833,BOOK XVII.,"The god then went back into the toil and turmoil, but the soul of"
9834,BOOK XVII.,Hector was darkened with a cloud of grief; he looked along the
9835,BOOK XVII.,ranks and saw Euphorbus lying on the ground with the blood still
9836,BOOK XVII.,"flowing from his wound, and Menelaus stripping him of his armour."
9837,BOOK XVII.,"On this he made his way to the front like a flame of fire, clad"
9838,BOOK XVII.,"in his gleaming armour, and crying with a loud voice. When the"
9839,BOOK XVII.,"son of Atreus heard him, he said to himself in his dismay, “Alas!"
9840,BOOK XVII.,what shall I do? I may not let the Trojans take the armour of
9841,BOOK XVII.,"Patroclus who has fallen fighting on my behalf, lest some Danaan"
9842,BOOK XVII.,who sees me should cry shame upon me. Still if for my honour’s
9843,BOOK XVII.,"sake I fight Hector and the Trojans single-handed, they will"
9844,BOOK XVII.,"prove too many for me, for Hector is bringing them up in force."
9845,BOOK XVII.,"Why, however, should I thus hesitate? When a man fights in"
9846,BOOK XVII.,"despite of heaven with one whom a god befriends, he will soon rue"
9847,BOOK XVII.,"it. Let no Danaan think ill of me if I give place to Hector, for"
9848,BOOK XVII.,"the hand of heaven is with him. Yet, if I could find Ajax, the"
9849,BOOK XVII.,"two of us would fight Hector and heaven too, if we might only"
9850,BOOK XVII.,"save the body of Patroclus for Achilles son of Peleus. This, of"
9851,BOOK XVII.,many evils would be the least.”
9852,BOOK XVII.,
9853,BOOK XVII.,"While he was thus in two minds, the Trojans came up to him with"
9854,BOOK XVII.,"Hector at their head; he therefore drew back and left the body,"
9855,BOOK XVII.,turning about like some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs
9856,BOOK XVII.,"and men from a stockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he"
9857,BOOK XVII.,is daunted and slinks sulkily off—even so did Menelaus son of
9858,BOOK XVII.,Atreus turn and leave the body of Patroclus. When among the body
9859,BOOK XVII.,"of his men, he looked around for mighty Ajax son of Telamon, and"
9860,BOOK XVII.,"presently saw him on the extreme left of the fight, cheering on"
9861,BOOK XVII.,"his men and exhorting them to keep on fighting, for Phoebus"
9862,BOOK XVII.,Apollo had spread a great panic among them. He ran up to him and
9863,BOOK XVII.,"said, “Ajax, my good friend, come with me at once to dead"
9864,BOOK XVII.,"Patroclus, if so be that we may take the body to Achilles—as for"
9865,BOOK XVII.,"his armour, Hector already has it.”"
9866,BOOK XVII.,
9867,BOOK XVII.,"These words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he made his way among"
9868,BOOK XVII.,"the front ranks, Menelaus going with him. Hector had stripped"
9869,BOOK XVII.,"Patroclus of his armour, and was dragging him away to cut off his"
9870,BOOK XVII.,head and take the body to fling before the dogs of Troy. But Ajax
9871,BOOK XVII.,"came up with his shield like wall before him, on which Hector"
9872,BOOK XVII.,"withdrew under shelter of his men, and sprang on to his chariot,"
9873,BOOK XVII.,"giving the armour over to the Trojans to take to the city, as a"
9874,BOOK XVII.,"great trophy for himself; Ajax, therefore, covered the body of"
9875,BOOK XVII.,Patroclus with his broad shield and bestrode him; as a lion
9876,BOOK XVII.,stands over his whelps if hunters have come upon him in a forest
9877,BOOK XVII.,when he is with his little ones—in the pride and fierceness of
9878,BOOK XVII.,his strength he draws his knit brows down till they cover his
9879,BOOK XVII.,"eyes—even so did Ajax bestride the body of Patroclus, and by his"
9880,BOOK XVII.,"side stood Menelaus son of Atreus, nursing great sorrow in his"
9881,BOOK XVII.,heart.
9882,BOOK XVII.,
9883,BOOK XVII.,Then Glaucus son of Hippolochus looked fiercely at Hector and
9884,BOOK XVII.,"rebuked him sternly. “Hector,” said he, “you make a brave show,"
9885,BOOK XVII.,but in fight you are sadly wanting. A runaway like yourself has
9886,BOOK XVII.,no claim to so great a reputation. Think how you may now save
9887,BOOK XVII.,your town and citadel by the hands of your own people born in
9888,BOOK XVII.,"Ilius; for you will get no Lycians to fight for you, seeing what"
9889,BOOK XVII.,thanks they have had for their incessant hardships. Are you
9890,BOOK XVII.,"likely, sir, to do anything to help a man of less note, after"
9891,BOOK XVII.,"leaving Sarpedon, who was at once your guest and comrade in arms,"
9892,BOOK XVII.,to be the spoil and prey of the Danaans? So long as he lived he
9893,BOOK XVII.,did good service both to your city and yourself; yet you had no
9894,BOOK XVII.,stomach to save his body from the dogs. If the Lycians will
9895,BOOK XVII.,"listen to me, they will go home and leave Troy to its fate. If"
9896,BOOK XVII.,the Trojans had any of that daring fearless spirit which lays
9897,BOOK XVII.,hold of men who are fighting for their country and harassing
9898,BOOK XVII.,"those who would attack it, we should soon bear off Patroclus into"
9899,BOOK XVII.,Ilius. Could we get this dead man away and bring him into the
9900,BOOK XVII.,"city of Priam, the Argives would readily give up the armour of"
9901,BOOK XVII.,"Sarpedon, and we should get his body to boot. For he whose squire"
9902,BOOK XVII.,has been now killed is the foremost man at the ships of the
9903,BOOK XVII.,Achaeans—he and his close fighting followers. Nevertheless you
9904,BOOK XVII.,"dared not make a stand against Ajax, nor face him, eye to eye,"
9905,BOOK XVII.,"with battle all round you, for he is a braver man than you are.”"
9906,BOOK XVII.,
9907,BOOK XVII.,"Hector scowled at him and answered, “Glaucus, you should know"
9908,BOOK XVII.,better. I have held you so far as a man of more understanding
9909,BOOK XVII.,"than any in all Lycia, but now I despise you for saying that I am"
9910,BOOK XVII.,"afraid of Ajax. I fear neither battle nor the din of chariots,"
9911,BOOK XVII.,but Jove’s will is stronger than ours; Jove at one time makes
9912,BOOK XVII.,"even a strong man draw back and snatches victory from his grasp,"
9913,BOOK XVII.,"while at another he will set him on to fight. Come hither then,"
9914,BOOK XVII.,"my friend, stand by me and see indeed whether I shall play the"
9915,BOOK XVII.,"coward the whole day through as you say, or whether I shall not"
9916,BOOK XVII.,stay some even of the boldest Danaans from fighting round the
9917,BOOK XVII.,body of Patroclus.”
9918,BOOK XVII.,
9919,BOOK XVII.,"As he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans saying, “Trojans,"
9920,BOOK XVII.,"Lycians, and Dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my"
9921,BOOK XVII.,"friends, and fight might and main, while I put on the goodly"
9922,BOOK XVII.,"armour of Achilles, which I took when I killed Patroclus.”"
9923,BOOK XVII.,
9924,BOOK XVII.,"With this Hector left the fight, and ran full speed after his men"
9925,BOOK XVII.,"who were taking the armour of Achilles to Troy, but had not yet"
9926,BOOK XVII.,"got far. Standing for a while apart from the woeful fight, he"
9927,BOOK XVII.,changed his armour. His own he sent to the strong city of Ilius
9928,BOOK XVII.,"and to the Trojans, while he put on the immortal armour of the"
9929,BOOK XVII.,"son of Peleus, which the gods had given to Peleus, who in his age"
9930,BOOK XVII.,gave it to his son; but the son did not grow old in his father’s
9931,BOOK XVII.,armour.
9932,BOOK XVII.,
9933,BOOK XVII.,"When Jove, lord of the storm-cloud, saw Hector standing aloof and"
9934,BOOK XVII.,"arming himself in the armour of the son of Peleus, he wagged his"
9935,BOOK XVII.,"head and muttered to himself saying, “A! poor wretch, you arm in"
9936,BOOK XVII.,"the armour of a hero, before whom many another trembles, and you"
9937,BOOK XVII.,reck nothing of the doom that is already close upon you. You have
9938,BOOK XVII.,"killed his comrade so brave and strong, but it was not well that"
9939,BOOK XVII.,you should strip the armour from his head and shoulders. I do
9940,BOOK XVII.,"indeed endow you with great might now, but as against this you"
9941,BOOK XVII.,shall not return from battle to lay the armour of the son of
9942,BOOK XVII.,Peleus before Andromache.”
9943,BOOK XVII.,
9944,BOOK XVII.,"The son of Saturn bowed his portentous brows, and Hector fitted"
9945,BOOK XVII.,"the armour to his body, while terrible Mars entered into him, and"
9946,BOOK XVII.,filled his whole body with might and valour. With a shout he
9947,BOOK XVII.,"strode in among the allies, and his armour flashed about him so"
9948,BOOK XVII.,that he seemed to all of them like the great son of Peleus
9949,BOOK XVII.,"himself. He went about among them and cheered them on—Mesthles,"
9950,BOOK XVII.,"Glaucus, Medon, Thersilochus, Asteropaeus, Deisenor and"
9951,BOOK XVII.,"Hippothous, Phorcys, Chromius and Ennomus the augur. All these"
9952,BOOK XVII.,"did he exhort saying, “Hear me, allies from other cities who are"
9953,BOOK XVII.,"here in your thousands, it was not in order to have a crowd about"
9954,BOOK XVII.,"me that I called you hither each from his several city, but that"
9955,BOOK XVII.,with heart and soul you might defend the wives and little ones of
9956,BOOK XVII.,the Trojans from the fierce Achaeans. For this do I oppress my
9957,BOOK XVII.,people with your food and the presents that make you rich.
9958,BOOK XVII.,"Therefore turn, and charge at the foe, to stand or fall as is the"
9959,BOOK XVII.,"game of war; whoever shall bring Patroclus, dead though he be,"
9960,BOOK XVII.,"into the hands of the Trojans, and shall make Ajax give way"
9961,BOOK XVII.,"before him, I will give him one half of the spoils while I keep"
9962,BOOK XVII.,the other. He will thus share like honour with myself.”
9963,BOOK XVII.,
9964,BOOK XVII.,When he had thus spoken they charged full weight upon the Danaans
9965,BOOK XVII.,"with their spears held out before them, and the hopes of each ran"
9966,BOOK XVII.,high that he should force Ajax son of Telamon to yield up the
9967,BOOK XVII.,"body—fools that they were, for he was about to take the lives of"
9968,BOOK XVII.,"many. Then Ajax said to Menelaus, “My good friend Menelaus, you"
9969,BOOK XVII.,and I shall hardly come out of this fight alive. I am less
9970,BOOK XVII.,"concerned for the body of Patroclus, who will shortly become meat"
9971,BOOK XVII.,"for the dogs and vultures of Troy, than for the safety of my own"
9972,BOOK XVII.,head and yours. Hector has wrapped us round in a storm of battle
9973,BOOK XVII.,"from every quarter, and our destruction seems now certain. Call"
9974,BOOK XVII.,then upon the princes of the Danaans if there is any who can hear
9975,BOOK XVII.,us.”
9976,BOOK XVII.,
9977,BOOK XVII.,"Menelaus did as he said, and shouted to the Danaans for help at"
9978,BOOK XVII.,"the top of his voice. “My friends,” he cried, “princes and"
9979,BOOK XVII.,"counsellors of the Argives, all you who with Agamemnon and"
9980,BOOK XVII.,"Menelaus drink at the public cost, and give orders each to his"
9981,BOOK XVII.,"own people as Jove vouchsafes him power and glory, the fight is"
9982,BOOK XVII.,so thick about me that I cannot distinguish you severally; come
9983,BOOK XVII.,"on, therefore, every man unbidden, and think it shame that"
9984,BOOK XVII.,Patroclus should become meat and morsel for Trojan hounds.”
9985,BOOK XVII.,
9986,BOOK XVII.,Fleet Ajax son of Oileus heard him and was first to force his way
9987,BOOK XVII.,through the fight and run to help him. Next came Idomeneus and
9988,BOOK XVII.,"Meriones his esquire, peer of murderous Mars. As for the others"
9989,BOOK XVII.,"that came into the fight after these, who of his own self could"
9990,BOOK XVII.,name them?
9991,BOOK XVII.,
9992,BOOK XVII.,The Trojans with Hector at their head charged in a body. As a
9993,BOOK XVII.,great wave that comes thundering in at the mouth of some
9994,BOOK XVII.,"heaven-born river, and the rocks that jut into the sea ring with"
9995,BOOK XVII.,the roar of the breakers that beat and buffet them—even with such
9996,BOOK XVII.,a roar did the Trojans come on; but the Achaeans in singleness of
9997,BOOK XVII.,"heart stood firm about the son of Menoetius, and fenced him with"
9998,BOOK XVII.,"their bronze shields. Jove, moreover, hid the brightness of their"
9999,BOOK XVII.,"helmets in a thick cloud, for he had borne no grudge against the"
10000,BOOK XVII.,son of Menoetius while he was still alive and squire to the
10001,BOOK XVII.,descendant of Aeacus; therefore he was loth to let him fall a
10002,BOOK XVII.,"prey to the dogs of his foes the Trojans, and urged his comrades"
10003,BOOK XVII.,on to defend him.
10004,BOOK XVII.,
10005,BOOK XVII.,"At first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back, and they withdrew"
10006,BOOK XVII.,from the dead man daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in killing
10007,BOOK XVII.,"any one, nevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans"
10008,BOOK XVII.,"did not lose it long, for Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after"
10009,BOOK XVII.,"the son of Peleus alike in stature and prowess, quickly rallied"
10010,BOOK XVII.,them and made towards the front like a wild boar upon the
10011,BOOK XVII.,mountains when he stands at bay in the forest glades and routs
10012,BOOK XVII.,the hounds and lusty youths that have attacked him—even so did
10013,BOOK XVII.,Ajax son of Telamon passing easily in among the phalanxes of the
10014,BOOK XVII.,"Trojans, disperse those who had bestridden Patroclus and were"
10015,BOOK XVII.,most bent on winning glory by dragging him off to their city. At
10016,BOOK XVII.,"this moment Hippothous brave son of the Pelasgian Lethus, in his"
10017,BOOK XVII.,"zeal for Hector and the Trojans, was dragging the body off by the"
10018,BOOK XVII.,"foot through the press of the fight, having bound a strap round"
10019,BOOK XVII.,the sinews near the ancle; but a mischief soon befell him from
10020,BOOK XVII.,"which none of those could save him who would have gladly done so,"
10021,BOOK XVII.,for the son of Telamon sprang forward and smote him on his
10022,BOOK XVII.,bronze-cheeked helmet. The plumed headpiece broke about the point
10023,BOOK XVII.,"of the weapon, struck at once by the spear and by the strong hand"
10024,BOOK XVII.,"of Ajax, so that the bloody brain came oozing out through the"
10025,BOOK XVII.,crest-socket. His strength then failed him and he let Patroclus’
10026,BOOK XVII.,"foot drop from his hand, as he fell full length dead upon the"
10027,BOOK XVII.,"body; thus he died far from the fertile land of Larissa, and"
10028,BOOK XVII.,"never repaid his parents the cost of bringing him up, for his"
10029,BOOK XVII.,life was cut short early by the spear of mighty Ajax. Hector then
10030,BOOK XVII.,"took aim at Ajax with a spear, but he saw it coming and just"
10031,BOOK XVII.,managed to avoid it; the spear passed on and struck Schedius son
10032,BOOK XVII.,"of noble Iphitus, captain of the Phoceans, who dwelt in famed"
10033,BOOK XVII.,Panopeus and reigned over much people; it struck him under the
10034,BOOK XVII.,middle of the collar-bone the bronze point went right through
10035,BOOK XVII.,"him, coming out at the bottom of his shoulder-blade, and his"
10036,BOOK XVII.,armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.
10037,BOOK XVII.,Ajax in his turn struck noble Phorcys son of Phaenops in the
10038,BOOK XVII.,"middle of the belly as he was bestriding Hippothous, and broke"
10039,BOOK XVII.,the plate of his cuirass; whereon the spear tore out his entrails
10040,BOOK XVII.,and he clutched the ground in his palm as he fell to earth.
10041,BOOK XVII.,"Hector and those who were in the front rank then gave ground,"
10042,BOOK XVII.,"while the Argives raised a loud cry of triumph, and drew off the"
10043,BOOK XVII.,bodies of Phorcys and Hippothous which they stripped presently of
10044,BOOK XVII.,their armour.
10045,BOOK XVII.,
10046,BOOK XVII.,The Trojans would now have been worsted by the brave Achaeans and
10047,BOOK XVII.,"driven back to Ilius through their own cowardice, while the"
10048,BOOK XVII.,"Argives, so great was their courage and endurance, would have"
10049,BOOK XVII.,"achieved a triumph even against the will of Jove, if Apollo had"
10050,BOOK XVII.,"not roused Aeneas, in the likeness of Periphas son of Epytus, an"
10051,BOOK XVII.,attendant who had grown old in the service of Aeneas’ aged
10052,BOOK XVII.,"father, and was at all times devoted to him. In his likeness,"
10053,BOOK XVII.,"then, Apollo said, “Aeneas, can you not manage, even though"
10054,BOOK XVII.,"heaven be against us, to save high Ilius? I have known men, whose"
10055,BOOK XVII.,"numbers, courage, and self-reliance have saved their people in"
10056,BOOK XVII.,"spite of Jove, whereas in this case he would much rather give"
10057,BOOK XVII.,"victory to us than to the Danaans, if you would only fight"
10058,BOOK XVII.,instead of being so terribly afraid.”
10059,BOOK XVII.,
10060,BOOK XVII.,"Aeneas knew Apollo when he looked straight at him, and shouted to"
10061,BOOK XVII.,"Hector saying, “Hector and all other Trojans and allies, shame on"
10062,BOOK XVII.,us if we are beaten by the Achaeans and driven back to Ilius
10063,BOOK XVII.,through our own cowardice. A god has just come up to me and told
10064,BOOK XVII.,me that Jove the supreme disposer will be with us. Therefore let
10065,BOOK XVII.,"us make for the Danaans, that it may go hard with them ere they"
10066,BOOK XVII.,bear away dead Patroclus to the ships.”
10067,BOOK XVII.,
10068,BOOK XVII.,"As he spoke he sprang out far in front of the others, who then"
10069,BOOK XVII.,rallied and again faced the Achaeans. Aeneas speared Leiocritus
10070,BOOK XVII.,"son of Arisbas, a valiant follower of Lycomedes, and Lycomedes"
10071,BOOK XVII.,was moved with pity as he saw him fall; he therefore went close
10072,BOOK XVII.,"up, and speared Apisaon son of Hippasus shepherd of his people in"
10073,BOOK XVII.,"the liver under the midriff, so that he died; he had come from"
10074,BOOK XVII.,fertile Paeonia and was the best man of them all after
10075,BOOK XVII.,Asteropaeus. Asteropaeus flew forward to avenge him and attack
10076,BOOK XVII.,"the Danaans, but this might no longer be, inasmuch as those about"
10077,BOOK XVII.,"Patroclus were well covered by their shields, and held their"
10078,BOOK XVII.,"spears in front of them, for Ajax had given them strict orders"
10079,BOOK XVII.,"that no man was either to give ground, or to stand out before the"
10080,BOOK XVII.,"others, but all were to hold well together about the body and"
10081,BOOK XVII.,"fight hand to hand. Thus did huge Ajax bid them, and the earth"
10082,BOOK XVII.,ran red with blood as the corpses fell thick on one another alike
10083,BOOK XVII.,"on the side of the Trojans and allies, and on that of the"
10084,BOOK XVII.,"Danaans; for these last, too, fought no bloodless fight though"
10085,BOOK XVII.,"many fewer of them perished, through the care they took to defend"
10086,BOOK XVII.,and stand by one another.
10087,BOOK XVII.,
10088,BOOK XVII.,Thus did they fight as it were a flaming fire; it seemed as
10089,BOOK XVII.,"though it had gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were"
10090,BOOK XVII.,hidden over all that part where the bravest heroes were fighting
10091,BOOK XVII.,"about the dead son of Menoetius, whereas the other Danaans and"
10092,BOOK XVII.,Achaeans fought at their ease in full daylight with brilliant
10093,BOOK XVII.,"sunshine all round them, and there was not a cloud to be seen"
10094,BOOK XVII.,neither on plain nor mountain. These last moreover would rest for
10095,BOOK XVII.,"a while and leave off fighting, for they were some distance apart"
10096,BOOK XVII.,"and beyond the range of one another’s weapons, whereas those who"
10097,BOOK XVII.,were in the thick of the fray suffered both from battle and
10098,BOOK XVII.,darkness. All the best of them were being worn out by the great
10099,BOOK XVII.,"weight of their armour, but the two valiant heroes, Thrasymedes"
10100,BOOK XVII.,"and Antilochus, had not yet heard of the death of Patroclus, and"
10101,BOOK XVII.,believed him to be still alive and leading the van against the
10102,BOOK XVII.,Trojans; they were keeping themselves in reserve against the
10103,BOOK XVII.,"death or rout of their own comrades, for so Nestor had ordered"
10104,BOOK XVII.,when he sent them from the ships into battle.
10105,BOOK XVII.,
10106,BOOK XVII.,"Thus through the livelong day did they wage fierce war, and the"
10107,BOOK XVII.,"sweat of their toil rained ever on their legs under them, and on"
10108,BOOK XVII.,"their hands and eyes, as they fought over the squire of the fleet"
10109,BOOK XVII.,son of Peleus. It was as when a man gives a great ox-hide all
10110,BOOK XVII.,"drenched in fat to his men, and bids them stretch it; whereon"
10111,BOOK XVII.,they stand round it in a ring and tug till the moisture leaves
10112,BOOK XVII.,"it, and the fat soaks in for the many that pull at it, and it is"
10113,BOOK XVII.,well stretched—even so did the two sides tug the dead body hither
10114,BOOK XVII.,and thither within the compass of but a little space—the Trojans
10115,BOOK XVII.,"steadfastly set on dragging it into Ilius, while the Achaeans"
10116,BOOK XVII.,were no less so on taking it to their ships; and fierce was the
10117,BOOK XVII.,"fight between them. Not Mars himself the lord of hosts, nor yet"
10118,BOOK XVII.,"Minerva, even in their fullest fury could make light of such a"
10119,BOOK XVII.,battle.
10120,BOOK XVII.,
10121,BOOK XVII.,Such fearful turmoil of men and horses did Jove on that day
10122,BOOK XVII.,ordain round the body of Patroclus. Meanwhile Achilles did not
10123,BOOK XVII.,"know that he had fallen, for the fight was under the wall of Troy"
10124,BOOK XVII.,"a long way off the ships. He had no idea, therefore, that"
10125,BOOK XVII.,"Patroclus was dead, and deemed that he would return alive as soon"
10126,BOOK XVII.,as he had gone close up to the gates. He knew that he was not to
10127,BOOK XVII.,"sack the city neither with nor without himself, for his mother"
10128,BOOK XVII.,"had often told him this when he had sat alone with her, and she"
10129,BOOK XVII.,"had informed him of the counsels of great Jove. Now, however, she"
10130,BOOK XVII.,had not told him how great a disaster had befallen him in the
10131,BOOK XVII.,death of the one who was far dearest to him of all his comrades.
10132,BOOK XVII.,
10133,BOOK XVII.,The others still kept on charging one another round the body with
10134,BOOK XVII.,"their pointed spears and killing each other. Then would one say,"
10135,BOOK XVII.,"“My friends, we can never again show our faces at the"
10136,BOOK XVII.,"ships—better, and greatly better, that earth should open and"
10137,BOOK XVII.,"swallow us here in this place, than that we should let the"
10138,BOOK XVII.,Trojans have the triumph of bearing off Patroclus to their city.”
10139,BOOK XVII.,
10140,BOOK XVII.,"The Trojans also on their part spoke to one another saying,"
10141,BOOK XVII.,"“Friends, though we fall to a man beside this body, let none"
10142,BOOK XVII.,shrink from fighting.” With such words did they exhort each
10143,BOOK XVII.,"other. They fought and fought, and an iron clank rose through the"
10144,BOOK XVII.,void air to the brazen vault of heaven. The horses of the
10145,BOOK XVII.,descendant of Aeacus stood out of the fight and wept when they
10146,BOOK XVII.,heard that their driver had been laid low by the hand of
10147,BOOK XVII.,"murderous Hector. Automedon, valiant son of Diores, lashed them"
10148,BOOK XVII.,"again and again; many a time did he speak kindly to them, and"
10149,BOOK XVII.,"many a time did he upbraid them, but they would neither go back"
10150,BOOK XVII.,"to the ships by the waters of the broad Hellespont, nor yet into"
10151,BOOK XVII.,battle among the Achaeans; they stood with their chariot stock
10152,BOOK XVII.,"still, as a pillar set over the tomb of some dead man or woman,"
10153,BOOK XVII.,and bowed their heads to the ground. Hot tears fell from their
10154,BOOK XVII.,"eyes as they mourned the loss of their charioteer, and their"
10155,BOOK XVII.,noble manes drooped all wet from under the yoke-straps on either
10156,BOOK XVII.,side the yoke.
10157,BOOK XVII.,
10158,BOOK XVII.,The son of Saturn saw them and took pity upon their sorrow. He
10159,BOOK XVII.,"wagged his head, and muttered to himself, saying, “Poor things,"
10160,BOOK XVII.,"why did we give you to King Peleus who is a mortal, while you are"
10161,BOOK XVII.,yourselves ageless and immortal? Was it that you might share the
10162,BOOK XVII.,sorrows that befall mankind? for of all creatures that live and
10163,BOOK XVII.,"move upon the earth there is none so pitiable as he is—still,"
10164,BOOK XVII.,Hector son of Priam shall drive neither you nor your chariot. I
10165,BOOK XVII.,will not have it. It is enough that he should have the armour
10166,BOOK XVII.,over which he vaunts so vainly. Furthermore I will give you
10167,BOOK XVII.,strength of heart and limb to bear Automedon safely to the ships
10168,BOOK XVII.,"from battle, for I shall let the Trojans triumph still further,"
10169,BOOK XVII.,and go on killing till they reach the ships; whereon night shall
10170,BOOK XVII.,fall and darkness overshadow the land.”
10171,BOOK XVII.,
10172,BOOK XVII.,As he spoke he breathed heart and strength into the horses so
10173,BOOK XVII.,"that they shook the dust from out of their manes, and bore their"
10174,BOOK XVII.,chariot swiftly into the fight that raged between Trojans and
10175,BOOK XVII.,Achaeans. Behind them fought Automedon full of sorrow for his
10176,BOOK XVII.,"comrade, as a vulture amid a flock of geese. In and out, and here"
10177,BOOK XVII.,"and there, full speed he dashed amid the throng of the Trojans,"
10178,BOOK XVII.,"but for all the fury of his pursuit he killed no man, for he"
10179,BOOK XVII.,could not wield his spear and keep his horses in hand when alone
10180,BOOK XVII.,"in the chariot; at last, however, a comrade, Alcimedon, son of"
10181,BOOK XVII.,Laerces son of Haemon caught sight of him and came up behind his
10182,BOOK XVII.,"chariot. “Automedon,” said he, “what god has put this folly into"
10183,BOOK XVII.,"your heart and robbed you of your right mind, that you fight the"
10184,BOOK XVII.,Trojans in the front rank single-handed? He who was your comrade
10185,BOOK XVII.,"is slain, and Hector plumes himself on being armed in the armour"
10186,BOOK XVII.,of the descendant of Aeacus.”
10187,BOOK XVII.,
10188,BOOK XVII.,"Automedon son of Diores answered, “Alcimedon, there is no one"
10189,BOOK XVII.,else who can control and guide the immortal steeds so well as you
10190,BOOK XVII.,"can, save only Patroclus—while he was alive—peer of gods in"
10191,BOOK XVII.,"counsel. Take then the whip and reins, while I go down from the"
10192,BOOK XVII.,car and fight.”
10193,BOOK XVII.,
10194,BOOK XVII.,"Alcimedon sprang on to the chariot, and caught up the whip and"
10195,BOOK XVII.,"reins, while Automedon leaped from off the car. When Hector saw"
10196,BOOK XVII.,"him he said to Aeneas who was near him, “Aeneas, counsellor of"
10197,BOOK XVII.,"the mail-clad Trojans, I see the steeds of the fleet son of"
10198,BOOK XVII.,"Aeacus come into battle with weak hands to drive them. I am sure,"
10199,BOOK XVII.,"if you think well, that we might take them; they will not dare"
10200,BOOK XVII.,face us if we both attack them.”
10201,BOOK XVII.,
10202,BOOK XVII.,"The valiant son of Anchises was of the same mind, and the pair"
10203,BOOK XVII.,"went right on, with their shoulders covered under shields of"
10204,BOOK XVII.,"tough dry ox-hide, overlaid with much bronze. Chromius and Aretus"
10205,BOOK XVII.,"went also with them, and their hearts beat high with hope that"
10206,BOOK XVII.,they might kill the men and capture the horses—fools that they
10207,BOOK XVII.,"were, for they were not to return scatheless from their meeting"
10208,BOOK XVII.,"with Automedon, who prayed to father Jove and was forthwith"
10209,BOOK XVII.,filled with courage and strength abounding. He turned to his
10210,BOOK XVII.,"trusty comrade Alcimedon and said, “Alcimedon, keep your horses"
10211,BOOK XVII.,so close up that I may feel their breath upon my back; I doubt
10212,BOOK XVII.,that we shall not stay Hector son of Priam till he has killed us
10213,BOOK XVII.,and mounted behind the horses; he will then either spread panic
10214,BOOK XVII.,"among the ranks of the Achaeans, or himself be killed among the"
10215,BOOK XVII.,foremost.”
10216,BOOK XVII.,
10217,BOOK XVII.,"On this he cried out to the two Ajaxes and Menelaus, “Ajaxes"
10218,BOOK XVII.,"captains of the Argives, and Menelaus, give the dead body over to"
10219,BOOK XVII.,"them that are best able to defend it, and come to the rescue of"
10220,BOOK XVII.,us living; for Hector and Aeneas who are the two best men among
10221,BOOK XVII.,"the Trojans, are pressing us hard in the full tide of war."
10222,BOOK XVII.,"Nevertheless the issue lies on the lap of heaven, I will"
10223,BOOK XVII.,therefore hurl my spear and leave the rest to Jove.”
10224,BOOK XVII.,
10225,BOOK XVII.,"He poised and hurled as he spoke, whereon the spear struck the"
10226,BOOK XVII.,"round shield of Aretus, and went right through it for the shield"
10227,BOOK XVII.,"stayed it not, so that it was driven through his belt into the"
10228,BOOK XVII.,"lower part of his belly. As when some sturdy youth, axe in hand,"
10229,BOOK XVII.,deals his blow behind the horns of an ox and severs the tendons
10230,BOOK XVII.,at the back of its neck so that it springs forward and then
10231,BOOK XVII.,"drops, even so did Aretus give one bound and then fall on his"
10232,BOOK XVII.,back the spear quivering in his body till it made an end of him.
10233,BOOK XVII.,Hector then aimed a spear at Automedon but he saw it coming and
10234,BOOK XVII.,"stooped forward to avoid it, so that it flew past him and the"
10235,BOOK XVII.,"point stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on quivering"
10236,BOOK XVII.,till Mars robbed it of its force. They would then have fought
10237,BOOK XVII.,hand to hand with swords had not the two Ajaxes forced their way
10238,BOOK XVII.,"through the crowd when they heard their comrade calling, and"
10239,BOOK XVII.,"parted them for all their fury—for Hector, Aeneas, and Chromius"
10240,BOOK XVII.,"were afraid and drew back, leaving Aretus to lie there struck to"
10241,BOOK XVII.,"the heart. Automedon, peer of fleet Mars, then stripped him of"
10242,BOOK XVII.,"his armour and vaunted over him saying, “I have done little to"
10243,BOOK XVII.,"assuage my sorrow for the son of Menoetius, for the man I have"
10244,BOOK XVII.,killed is not so good as he was.”
10245,BOOK XVII.,
10246,BOOK XVII.,As he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils and laid them upon
10247,BOOK XVII.,his chariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet all
10248,BOOK XVII.,steeped in gore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull.
10249,BOOK XVII.,
10250,BOOK XVII.,"And now the fierce groanful fight again raged about Patroclus,"
10251,BOOK XVII.,for Minerva came down from heaven and roused its fury by the
10252,BOOK XVII.,"command of far-seeing Jove, who had changed his mind and sent her"
10253,BOOK XVII.,to encourage the Danaans. As when Jove bends his bright bow in
10254,BOOK XVII.,heaven in token to mankind either of war or of the chill storms
10255,BOOK XVII.,"that stay men from their labour and plague the flocks—even so,"
10256,BOOK XVII.,"wrapped in such radiant raiment, did Minerva go in among the host"
10257,BOOK XVII.,and speak man by man to each. First she took the form and voice
10258,BOOK XVII.,"of Phoenix and spoke to Menelaus son of Atreus, who was standing"
10259,BOOK XVII.,"near her. “Menelaus,” said she, “it will be shame and dishonour"
10260,BOOK XVII.,"to you, if dogs tear the noble comrade of Achilles under the"
10261,BOOK XVII.,"walls of Troy. Therefore be staunch, and urge your men to be so"
10262,BOOK XVII.,also.”
10263,BOOK XVII.,
10264,BOOK XVII.,"Menelaus answered, “Phoenix, my good old friend, may Minerva"
10265,BOOK XVII.,"vouchsafe me strength and keep the darts from off me, for so"
10266,BOOK XVII.,shall I stand by Patroclus and defend him; his death has gone to
10267,BOOK XVII.,"my heart, but Hector is as a raging fire and deals his blows"
10268,BOOK XVII.,"without ceasing, for Jove is now granting him a time of triumph.”"
10269,BOOK XVII.,
10270,BOOK XVII.,Minerva was pleased at his having named herself before any of the
10271,BOOK XVII.,other gods. Therefore she put strength into his knees and
10272,BOOK XVII.,"shoulders, and made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven"
10273,BOOK XVII.,"off will yet come again and bite if it can, so dearly does it"
10274,BOOK XVII.,love man’s blood—even so bold as this did she make him as he
10275,BOOK XVII.,stood over Patroclus and threw his spear. Now there was among the
10276,BOOK XVII.,"Trojans a man named Podes, son of Eetion, who was both rich and"
10277,BOOK XVII.,valiant. Hector held him in the highest honour for he was his
10278,BOOK XVII.,comrade and boon companion; the spear of Menelaus struck this man
10279,BOOK XVII.,"in the girdle just as he had turned in flight, and went right"
10280,BOOK XVII.,"through him. Whereon he fell heavily forward, and Menelaus son of"
10281,BOOK XVII.,Atreus drew off his body from the Trojans into the ranks of his
10282,BOOK XVII.,own people.
10283,BOOK XVII.,
10284,BOOK XVII.,"Apollo then went up to Hector and spurred him on to fight, in the"
10285,BOOK XVII.,likeness of Phaenops son of Asius who lived in Abydos and was the
10286,BOOK XVII.,most favoured of all Hector’s guests. In his likeness Apollo
10287,BOOK XVII.,"said, “Hector, who of the Achaeans will fear you henceforward now"
10288,BOOK XVII.,that you have quailed before Menelaus who has ever been rated
10289,BOOK XVII.,poorly as a soldier? Yet he has now got a corpse away from the
10290,BOOK XVII.,"Trojans single-handed, and has slain your own true comrade, a man"
10291,BOOK XVII.,"brave among the foremost, Podes son of Eetion.”"
10292,BOOK XVII.,
10293,BOOK XVII.,"A dark cloud of grief fell upon Hector as he heard, and he made"
10294,BOOK XVII.,his way to the front clad in full armour. Thereon the son of
10295,BOOK XVII.,"Saturn seized his bright tasselled aegis, and veiled Ida in"
10296,BOOK XVII.,"cloud: he sent forth his lightnings and his thunders, and as he"
10297,BOOK XVII.,shook his aegis he gave victory to the Trojans and routed the
10298,BOOK XVII.,Achaeans.
10299,BOOK XVII.,
10300,BOOK XVII.,"The panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian, for while keeping"
10301,BOOK XVII.,his face turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a spear
10302,BOOK XVII.,on the upper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by Polydamas
10303,BOOK XVII.,"had grazed the top of the bone, for Polydamas had come up to him"
10304,BOOK XVII.,and struck him from close at hand. Then Hector in close combat
10305,BOOK XVII.,"struck Leitus son of noble Alectryon in the hand by the wrist,"
10306,BOOK XVII.,and disabled him from fighting further. He looked about him in
10307,BOOK XVII.,"dismay, knowing that never again should he wield spear in battle"
10308,BOOK XVII.,"with the Trojans. While Hector was in pursuit of Leitus,"
10309,BOOK XVII.,Idomeneus struck him on the breastplate over his chest near the
10310,BOOK XVII.,"nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft, and the Trojans cheered"
10311,BOOK XVII.,aloud. Hector then aimed at Idomeneus son of Deucalion as he was
10312,BOOK XVII.,"standing on his chariot, and very narrowly missed him, but the"
10313,BOOK XVII.,"spear hit Coiranus, a follower and charioteer of Meriones who had"
10314,BOOK XVII.,come with him from Lyctus. Idomeneus had left the ships on foot
10315,BOOK XVII.,and would have afforded a great triumph to the Trojans if
10316,BOOK XVII.,"Coiranus had not driven quickly up to him, he therefore brought"
10317,BOOK XVII.,"life and rescue to Idomeneus, but himself fell by the hand of"
10318,BOOK XVII.,murderous Hector. For Hector hit him on the jaw under the ear;
10319,BOOK XVII.,the end of the spear drove out his teeth and cut his tongue in
10320,BOOK XVII.,"two pieces, so that he fell from his chariot and let the reins"
10321,BOOK XVII.,fall to the ground. Meriones gathered them up from the ground and
10322,BOOK XVII.,"took them into his own hands, then he said to Idomeneus, “Lay on,"
10323,BOOK XVII.,"till you get back to the ships, for you must see that the day is"
10324,BOOK XVII.,no longer ours.”
10325,BOOK XVII.,
10326,BOOK XVII.,"On this Idomeneus lashed the horses to the ships, for fear had"
10327,BOOK XVII.,taken hold upon him.
10328,BOOK XVII.,
10329,BOOK XVII.,Ajax and Menelaus noted how Jove had turned the scale in favour
10330,BOOK XVII.,"of the Trojans, and Ajax was first to speak. “Alas,” said he,"
10331,BOOK XVII.,“even a fool may see that father Jove is helping the Trojans. All
10332,BOOK XVII.,their weapons strike home; no matter whether it be a brave man or
10333,BOOK XVII.,"a coward that hurls them, Jove speeds all alike, whereas ours"
10334,BOOK XVII.,"fall each one of them without effect. What, then, will be best"
10335,BOOK XVII.,"both as regards rescuing the body, and our return to the joy of"
10336,BOOK XVII.,our friends who will be grieving as they look hitherwards; for
10337,BOOK XVII.,they will make sure that nothing can now check the terrible hands
10338,BOOK XVII.,"of Hector, and that he will fling himself upon our ships. I wish"
10339,BOOK XVII.,"that some one would go and tell the son of Peleus at once, for I"
10340,BOOK XVII.,do not think he can have yet heard the sad news that the dearest
10341,BOOK XVII.,of his friends has fallen. But I can see not a man among the
10342,BOOK XVII.,"Achaeans to send, for they and their chariots are alike hidden in"
10343,BOOK XVII.,"darkness. O father Jove, lift this cloud from over the sons of"
10344,BOOK XVII.,"the Achaeans; make heaven serene, and let us see; if you will"
10345,BOOK XVII.,"that we perish, let us fall at any rate by daylight.”"
10346,BOOK XVII.,
10347,BOOK XVII.,Father Jove heard him and had compassion upon his tears.
10348,BOOK XVII.,"Forthwith he chased away the cloud of darkness, so that the sun"
10349,BOOK XVII.,shone out and all the fighting was revealed. Ajax then said to
10350,BOOK XVII.,"Menelaus, “Look, Menelaus, and if Antilochus son of Nestor be"
10351,BOOK XVII.,"still living, send him at once to tell Achilles that by far the"
10352,BOOK XVII.,dearest to him of all his comrades has fallen.”
10353,BOOK XVII.,
10354,BOOK XVII.,Menelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from a
10355,BOOK XVII.,"stockyard—the lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who"
10356,BOOK XVII.,keep watch the whole night through and will not let him feast on
10357,BOOK XVII.,the fat of their herd. In his lust of meat he makes straight at
10358,BOOK XVII.,"them but in vain, for darts from strong hands assail him, and"
10359,BOOK XVII.,"burning brands which daunt him for all his hunger, so in the"
10360,BOOK XVII.,morning he slinks sulkily away—even so did Menelaus sorely
10361,BOOK XVII.,"against his will leave Patroclus, in great fear lest the Achaeans"
10362,BOOK XVII.,should be driven back in rout and let him fall into the hands of
10363,BOOK XVII.,"the foe. He charged Meriones and the two Ajaxes straitly saying,"
10364,BOOK XVII.,"“Ajaxes and Meriones, leaders of the Argives, now indeed remember"
10365,BOOK XVII.,"how good Patroclus was; he was ever courteous while alive, bear"
10366,BOOK XVII.,it in mind now that he is dead.”
10367,BOOK XVII.,
10368,BOOK XVII.,"With this Menelaus left them, looking round him as keenly as an"
10369,BOOK XVII.,"eagle, whose sight they say is keener than that of any other"
10370,BOOK XVII.,"bird—however high he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs"
10371,BOOK XVII.,"can escape him by crouching under bush or thicket, for he will"
10372,BOOK XVII.,"swoop down upon it and make an end of it—even so, O Menelaus, did"
10373,BOOK XVII.,your keen eyes range round the mighty host of your followers to
10374,BOOK XVII.,see if you could find the son of Nestor still alive. Presently
10375,BOOK XVII.,Menelaus saw him on the extreme left of the battle cheering on
10376,BOOK XVII.,his men and exhorting them to fight boldly. Menelaus went up to
10377,BOOK XVII.,"him and said, “Antilochus, come here and listen to sad news,"
10378,BOOK XVII.,which I would indeed were untrue. You must see with your own eyes
10379,BOOK XVII.,"that heaven is heaping calamity upon the Danaans, and giving"
10380,BOOK XVII.,"victory to the Trojans. Patroclus has fallen, who was the bravest"
10381,BOOK XVII.,"of the Achaeans, and sorely will the Danaans miss him. Run"
10382,BOOK XVII.,"instantly to the ships and tell Achilles, that he may come to"
10383,BOOK XVII.,"rescue the body and bear it to the ships. As for the armour,"
10384,BOOK XVII.,Hector already has it.”
10385,BOOK XVII.,
10386,BOOK XVII.,Antilochus was struck with horror. For a long time he was
10387,BOOK XVII.,speechless; his eyes filled with tears and he could find no
10388,BOOK XVII.,"utterance, but he did as Menelaus had said, and set off running"
10389,BOOK XVII.,"as soon as he had given his armour to a comrade, Laodocus, who"
10390,BOOK XVII.,"was wheeling his horses round, close beside him."
10391,BOOK XVII.,
10392,BOOK XVII.,"Thus, then, did he run weeping from the field, to carry the bad"
10393,BOOK XVII.,"news to Achilles son of Peleus. Nor were you, O Menelaus, minded"
10394,BOOK XVII.,"to succour his harassed comrades, when Antilochus had left the"
10395,BOOK XVII.,Pylians—and greatly did they miss him—but he sent them noble
10396,BOOK XVII.,"Thrasymedes, and himself went back to Patroclus. He came running"
10397,BOOK XVII.,"up to the two Ajaxes and said, “I have sent Antilochus to the"
10398,BOOK XVII.,"ships to tell Achilles, but rage against Hector as he may, he"
10399,BOOK XVII.,"cannot come, for he cannot fight without armour. What then will"
10400,BOOK XVII.,"be our best plan both as regards rescuing the dead, and our own"
10401,BOOK XVII.,escape from death amid the battle-cries of the Trojans?”
10402,BOOK XVII.,
10403,BOOK XVII.,"Ajax answered, “Menelaus, you have said well: do you, then, and"
10404,BOOK XVII.,"Meriones stoop down, raise the body, and bear it out of the fray,"
10405,BOOK XVII.,"while we two behind you keep off Hector and the Trojans, one in"
10406,BOOK XVII.,"heart as in name, and long used to fighting side by side with one"
10407,BOOK XVII.,another.”
10408,BOOK XVII.,
10409,BOOK XVII.,On this Menelaus and Meriones took the dead man in their arms and
10410,BOOK XVII.,lifted him high aloft with a great effort. The Trojan host raised
10411,BOOK XVII.,a hue and cry behind them when they saw the Achaeans bearing the
10412,BOOK XVII.,"body away, and flew after them like hounds attacking a wounded"
10413,BOOK XVII.,boar at the loo of a band of young huntsmen. For a while the
10414,BOOK XVII.,"hounds fly at him as though they would tear him in pieces, but"
10415,BOOK XVII.,"now and again he turns on them in a fury, scaring and scattering"
10416,BOOK XVII.,them in all directions—even so did the Trojans for a while charge
10417,BOOK XVII.,"in a body, striking with sword and with spears pointed at both"
10418,BOOK XVII.,"the ends, but when the two Ajaxes faced them and stood at bay,"
10419,BOOK XVII.,they would turn pale and no man dared press on to fight further
10420,BOOK XVII.,about the dead.
10421,BOOK XVII.,
10422,BOOK XVII.,In this wise did the two heroes strain every nerve to bear the
10423,BOOK XVII.,body to the ships out of the fight. The battle raged round them
10424,BOOK XVII.,like fierce flames that when once kindled spread like wildfire
10425,BOOK XVII.,"over a city, and the houses fall in the glare of its burning—even"
10426,BOOK XVII.,such was the roar and tramp of men and horses that pursued them
10427,BOOK XVII.,as they bore Patroclus from the field. Or as mules that put forth
10428,BOOK XVII.,all their strength to draw some beam or great piece of ship’s
10429,BOOK XVII.,"timber down a rough mountain-track, and they pant and sweat as"
10430,BOOK XVII.,they go—even so did Menelaus and Meriones pant and sweat as they bore the
10431,BOOK XVII.,body of Patroclus. Behind them the two Ajaxes held stoutly out.
10432,BOOK XVII.,As some wooded mountain-spur that stretches across a plain will
10433,BOOK XVII.,"turn water and check the flow even of a great river, nor is there"
10434,BOOK XVII.,any stream strong enough to break through it—even so did the two
10435,BOOK XVII.,Ajaxes face the Trojans and stem the tide of their fighting
10436,BOOK XVII.,though they kept pouring on towards them and foremost among them
10437,BOOK XVII.,all was Aeneas son of Anchises with valiant Hector. As a flock of
10438,BOOK XVII.,daws or starlings fall to screaming and chattering when they see
10439,BOOK XVII.,"a falcon, foe to all small birds, come soaring near them, even so"
10440,BOOK XVII.,did the Achaean youth raise a babel of cries as they fled before
10441,BOOK XVII.,"Aeneas and Hector, unmindful of their former prowess. In the rout"
10442,BOOK XVII.,"of the Danaans much goodly armour fell round about the trench,"
10443,BOOK XVII.,and of fighting there was no end.

10453,BOOK XVIII.,
10454,BOOK XVIII.,Thus then did they fight as it were a flaming fire. Meanwhile the
10455,BOOK XVIII.,"fleet runner Antilochus, who had been sent as messenger, reached"
10456,BOOK XVIII.,"Achilles, and found him sitting by his tall ships and boding that"
10457,BOOK XVIII.,"which was indeed too surely true. “Alas,” said he to himself in"
10458,BOOK XVIII.,"the heaviness of his heart, “why are the Achaeans again scouring"
10459,BOOK XVIII.,the plain and flocking towards the ships? Heaven grant the gods
10460,BOOK XVIII.,be not now bringing that sorrow upon me of which my mother Thetis
10461,BOOK XVIII.,"spoke, saying that while I was yet alive the bravest of the"
10462,BOOK XVIII.,"Myrmidons should fall before the Trojans, and see the light of"
10463,BOOK XVIII.,the sun no longer. I fear the brave son of Menoetius has fallen
10464,BOOK XVIII.,through his own daring and yet I bade him return to the ships as
10465,BOOK XVIII.,soon as he had driven back those that were bringing fire against
10466,BOOK XVIII.,"them, and not join battle with Hector.”"
10467,BOOK XVIII.,
10468,BOOK XVIII.,"As he was thus pondering, the son of Nestor came up to him and"
10469,BOOK XVIII.,"told his sad tale, weeping bitterly the while. “Alas,” he cried,"
10470,BOOK XVIII.,"“son of noble Peleus, I bring you bad tidings, would indeed that"
10471,BOOK XVIII.,"they were untrue. Patroclus has fallen, and a fight is raging"
10472,BOOK XVIII.,about his naked body—for Hector holds his armour.”
10473,BOOK XVIII.,
10474,BOOK XVIII.,A dark cloud of grief fell upon Achilles as he listened. He
10475,BOOK XVIII.,"filled both hands with dust from off the ground, and poured it"
10476,BOOK XVIII.,"over his head, disfiguring his comely face, and letting the"
10477,BOOK XVIII.,refuse settle over his shirt so fair and new. He flung himself
10478,BOOK XVIII.,"down all huge and hugely at full length, and tore his hair with"
10479,BOOK XVIII.,his hands. The bondswomen whom Achilles and Patroclus had taken
10480,BOOK XVIII.,"captive screamed aloud for grief, beating their breasts, and with"
10481,BOOK XVIII.,their limbs failing them for sorrow. Antilochus bent over him the
10482,BOOK XVIII.,"while, weeping and holding both his hands as he lay groaning for"
10483,BOOK XVIII.,he feared that he might plunge a knife into his own throat. Then
10484,BOOK XVIII.,Achilles gave a loud cry and his mother heard him as she was
10485,BOOK XVIII.,"sitting in the depths of the sea by the old man her father,"
10486,BOOK XVIII.,"whereon she screamed, and all the goddesses daughters of Nereus"
10487,BOOK XVIII.,"that dwelt at the bottom of the sea, came gathering round her."
10488,BOOK XVIII.,"There were Glauce, Thalia and Cymodoce, Nesaia, Speo, Thoe and"
10489,BOOK XVIII.,"dark-eyed Halie, Cymothoe, Actaea and Limnorea, Melite, Iaera,"
10490,BOOK XVIII.,"Amphithoe and Agave, Doto and Proto, Pherusa and Dynamene,"
10491,BOOK XVIII.,"Dexamene, Amphinome and Callianeira, Doris, Panope, and the"
10492,BOOK XVIII.,"famous sea-nymph Galatea, Nemertes, Apseudes and Callianassa."
10493,BOOK XVIII.,"There were also Clymene, Ianeira and Ianassa, Maera, Oreithuia"
10494,BOOK XVIII.,"and Amatheia of the lovely locks, with other Nereids who dwell in"
10495,BOOK XVIII.,the depths of the sea. The crystal cave was filled with their
10496,BOOK XVIII.,multitude and they all beat their breasts while Thetis led them
10497,BOOK XVIII.,in their lament.
10498,BOOK XVIII.,
10499,BOOK XVIII.,"“Listen,” she cried, “sisters, daughters of Nereus, that you may"
10500,BOOK XVIII.,"hear the burden of my sorrows. Alas, woe is me, woe in that I"
10501,BOOK XVIII.,have borne the most glorious of offspring. I bore him fair and
10502,BOOK XVIII.,"strong, hero among heroes, and he shot up as a sapling; I tended"
10503,BOOK XVIII.,"him as a plant in a goodly garden, and sent him with his ships to"
10504,BOOK XVIII.,"Ilius to fight the Trojans, but never shall I welcome him back to"
10505,BOOK XVIII.,the house of Peleus. So long as he lives to look upon the light
10506,BOOK XVIII.,"of the sun he is in heaviness, and though I go to him I cannot"
10507,BOOK XVIII.,"help him. Nevertheless I will go, that I may see my dear son and"
10508,BOOK XVIII.,learn what sorrow has befallen him though he is still holding
10509,BOOK XVIII.,aloof from battle.”
10510,BOOK XVIII.,
10511,BOOK XVIII.,"She left the cave as she spoke, while the others followed weeping"
10512,BOOK XVIII.,"after, and the waves opened a path before them. When they reached"
10513,BOOK XVIII.,"the rich plain of Troy, they came up out of the sea in a long"
10514,BOOK XVIII.,"line on to the sands, at the place where the ships of the"
10515,BOOK XVIII.,Myrmidons were drawn up in close order round the tents of
10516,BOOK XVIII.,Achilles. His mother went up to him as he lay groaning; she laid
10517,BOOK XVIII.,"her hand upon his head and spoke piteously, saying, “My son, why"
10518,BOOK XVIII.,are you thus weeping? What sorrow has now befallen you? Tell me;
10519,BOOK XVIII.,hide it not from me. Surely Jove has granted you the prayer you
10520,BOOK XVIII.,"made him, when you lifted up your hands and besought him that the"
10521,BOOK XVIII.,"Achaeans might all of them be pent up at their ships, and rue it"
10522,BOOK XVIII.,bitterly in that you were no longer with them.”
10523,BOOK XVIII.,
10524,BOOK XVIII.,"Achilles groaned and answered, “Mother, Olympian Jove has indeed"
10525,BOOK XVIII.,"vouchsafed me the fulfilment of my prayer, but what boots it to"
10526,BOOK XVIII.,"me, seeing that my dear comrade Patroclus has fallen—he whom I"
10527,BOOK XVIII.,"valued more than all others, and loved as dearly as my own life?"
10528,BOOK XVIII.,"I have lost him; aye, and Hector when he had killed him stripped"
10529,BOOK XVIII.,"the wondrous armour, so glorious to behold, which the gods gave"
10530,BOOK XVIII.,to Peleus when they laid you in the couch of a mortal man. Would
10531,BOOK XVIII.,"that you were still dwelling among the immortal sea-nymphs, and"
10532,BOOK XVIII.,that Peleus had taken to himself some mortal bride. For now you
10533,BOOK XVIII.,shall have grief infinite by reason of the death of that son whom
10534,BOOK XVIII.,"you can never welcome home—nay, I will not live nor go about"
10535,BOOK XVIII.,"among mankind unless Hector fall by my spear, and thus pay me for"
10536,BOOK XVIII.,having slain Patroclus son of Menoetius.”
10537,BOOK XVIII.,
10538,BOOK XVIII.,"Thetis wept and answered, “Then, my son, is your end near at"
10539,BOOK XVIII.,hand—for your own death awaits you full soon after that of
10540,BOOK XVIII.,Hector.”
10541,BOOK XVIII.,
10542,BOOK XVIII.,"Then said Achilles in his great grief, “I would die here and now,"
10543,BOOK XVIII.,"in that I could not save my comrade. He has fallen far from home,"
10544,BOOK XVIII.,and in his hour of need my hand was not there to help him. What
10545,BOOK XVIII.,"is there for me? Return to my own land I shall not, and I have"
10546,BOOK XVIII.,brought no saving neither to Patroclus nor to my other comrades
10547,BOOK XVIII.,of whom so many have been slain by mighty Hector; I stay here by
10548,BOOK XVIII.,"my ships a bootless burden upon the earth, I, who in fight have"
10549,BOOK XVIII.,"no peer among the Achaeans, though in council there are better"
10550,BOOK XVIII.,"than I. Therefore, perish strife both from among gods and men,"
10551,BOOK XVIII.,"and anger, wherein even a righteous man will harden his"
10552,BOOK XVIII.,"heart—which rises up in the soul of a man like smoke, and the"
10553,BOOK XVIII.,taste thereof is sweeter than drops of honey. Even so has
10554,BOOK XVIII.,"Agamemnon angered me. And yet—so be it, for it is over; I will"
10555,BOOK XVIII.,force my soul into subjection as I needs must; I will go; I will
10556,BOOK XVIII.,"pursue Hector who has slain him whom I loved so dearly, and will"
10557,BOOK XVIII.,then abide my doom when it may please Jove and the other gods to
10558,BOOK XVIII.,"send it. Even Hercules, the best beloved of Jove—even he could"
10559,BOOK XVIII.,"not escape the hand of death, but fate and Juno’s fierce anger"
10560,BOOK XVIII.,"laid him low, as I too shall lie when I am dead if a like doom"
10561,BOOK XVIII.,"awaits me. Till then I will win fame, and will bid Trojan and"
10562,BOOK XVIII.,Dardanian women wring tears from their tender cheeks with both
10563,BOOK XVIII.,their hands in the grievousness of their great sorrow; thus shall
10564,BOOK XVIII.,they know that he who has held aloof so long will hold aloof no
10565,BOOK XVIII.,"longer. Hold me not back, therefore, in the love you bear me, for"
10566,BOOK XVIII.,you shall not move me.”
10567,BOOK XVIII.,
10568,BOOK XVIII.,"Then silver-footed Thetis answered, “My son, what you have said"
10569,BOOK XVIII.,"is true. It is well to save your comrades from destruction, but"
10570,BOOK XVIII.,your armour is in the hands of the Trojans; Hector bears it in
10571,BOOK XVIII.,triumph upon his own shoulders. Full well I know that his vaunt
10572,BOOK XVIII.,"shall not be lasting, for his end is close at hand; go not,"
10573,BOOK XVIII.,"however, into the press of battle till you see me return hither;"
10574,BOOK XVIII.,"to-morrow at break of day I shall be here, and will bring you"
10575,BOOK XVIII.,goodly armour from King Vulcan.”
10576,BOOK XVIII.,
10577,BOOK XVIII.,"On this she left her brave son, and as she turned away she said"
10578,BOOK XVIII.,"to the sea-nymphs her sisters, “Dive into the bosom of the sea"
10579,BOOK XVIII.,and go to the house of the old sea-god my father. Tell him
10580,BOOK XVIII.,"everything; as for me, I will go to the cunning workman Vulcan on"
10581,BOOK XVIII.,"high Olympus, and ask him to provide my son with a suit of"
10582,BOOK XVIII.,splendid armour.”
10583,BOOK XVIII.,
10584,BOOK XVIII.,"When she had so said, they dived forthwith beneath the waves,"
10585,BOOK XVIII.,while silver-footed Thetis went her way that she might bring the
10586,BOOK XVIII.,armour for her son.
10587,BOOK XVIII.,
10588,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus, then, did her feet bear the goddess to Olympus, and"
10589,BOOK XVIII.,meanwhile the Achaeans were flying with loud cries before
10590,BOOK XVIII.,"murderous Hector till they reached the ships and the Hellespont,"
10591,BOOK XVIII.,and they could not draw the body of Mars’s servant Patroclus out
10592,BOOK XVIII.,"of reach of the weapons that were showered upon him, for Hector"
10593,BOOK XVIII.,son of Priam with his host and horsemen had again caught up to
10594,BOOK XVIII.,him like the flame of a fiery furnace; thrice did brave Hector
10595,BOOK XVIII.,"seize him by the feet, striving with might and main to draw him"
10596,BOOK XVIII.,"away and calling loudly on the Trojans, and thrice did the two"
10597,BOOK XVIII.,"Ajaxes, clothed in valour as with a garment, beat him from off"
10598,BOOK XVIII.,the body; but all undaunted he would now charge into the thick of
10599,BOOK XVIII.,"the fight, and now again he would stand still and cry aloud, but"
10600,BOOK XVIII.,he would give no ground. As upland shepherds that cannot chase
10601,BOOK XVIII.,"some famished lion from a carcase, even so could not the two"
10602,BOOK XVIII.,Ajaxes scare Hector son of Priam from the body of Patroclus.
10603,BOOK XVIII.,
10604,BOOK XVIII.,And now he would even have dragged it off and have won
10605,BOOK XVIII.,"imperishable glory, had not Iris fleet as the wind, winged her"
10606,BOOK XVIII.,way as messenger from Olympus to the son of Peleus and bidden him
10607,BOOK XVIII.,arm. She came secretly without the knowledge of Jove and of the
10608,BOOK XVIII.,"other gods, for Juno sent her, and when she had got close to him"
10609,BOOK XVIII.,"she said, “Up, son of Peleus, mightiest of all mankind; rescue"
10610,BOOK XVIII.,Patroclus about whom this fearful fight is now raging by the
10611,BOOK XVIII.,"ships. Men are killing one another, the Danaans in defence of the"
10612,BOOK XVIII.,"dead body, while the Trojans are trying to hale it away, and take"
10613,BOOK XVIII.,it to windy Ilius: Hector is the most furious of them all; he is
10614,BOOK XVIII.,for cutting the head from the body and fixing it on the stakes of
10615,BOOK XVIII.,"the wall. Up, then, and bide here no longer; shrink from the"
10616,BOOK XVIII.,thought that Patroclus may become meat for the dogs of Troy.
10617,BOOK XVIII.,"Shame on you, should his body suffer any kind of outrage.”"
10618,BOOK XVIII.,
10619,BOOK XVIII.,"And Achilles said, “Iris, which of the gods was it that sent you"
10620,BOOK XVIII.,to me?”
10621,BOOK XVIII.,
10622,BOOK XVIII.,"Iris answered, “It was Juno the royal spouse of Jove, but the son"
10623,BOOK XVIII.,"of Saturn does not know of my coming, nor yet does any other of"
10624,BOOK XVIII.,the immortals who dwell on the snowy summits of Olympus.”
10625,BOOK XVIII.,
10626,BOOK XVIII.,"Then fleet Achilles answered her saying, “How can I go up into"
10627,BOOK XVIII.,the battle? They have my armour. My mother forbade me to arm till
10628,BOOK XVIII.,"I should see her come, for she promised to bring me goodly armour"
10629,BOOK XVIII.,"from Vulcan; I know no man whose arms I can put on, save only the"
10630,BOOK XVIII.,"shield of Ajax son of Telamon, and he surely must be fighting in"
10631,BOOK XVIII.,the front rank and wielding his spear about the body of dead
10632,BOOK XVIII.,Patroclus.”
10633,BOOK XVIII.,
10634,BOOK XVIII.,"Iris said, “We know that your armour has been taken, but go as"
10635,BOOK XVIII.,you are; go to the deep trench and show yourself before the
10636,BOOK XVIII.,"Trojans, that they may fear you and cease fighting. Thus will the"
10637,BOOK XVIII.,"fainting sons of the Achaeans gain some brief breathing time,"
10638,BOOK XVIII.,which in battle may hardly be.”
10639,BOOK XVIII.,
10640,BOOK XVIII.,Iris left him when she had so spoken. But Achilles dear to Jove
10641,BOOK XVIII.,"arose, and Minerva flung her tasselled aegis round his strong"
10642,BOOK XVIII.,shoulders; she crowned his head with a halo of golden cloud from
10643,BOOK XVIII.,which she kindled a glow of gleaming fire. As the smoke that goes
10644,BOOK XVIII.,up into heaven from some city that is being beleaguered on an
10645,BOOK XVIII.,island far out at sea—all day long do men sally from the city and
10646,BOOK XVIII.,"fight their hardest, and at the going down of the sun the line of"
10647,BOOK XVIII.,"beacon-fires blazes forth, flaring high for those that dwell near"
10648,BOOK XVIII.,"them to behold, if so be that they may come with their ships and"
10649,BOOK XVIII.,succour them—even so did the light flare from the head of
10650,BOOK XVIII.,"Achilles, as he stood by the trench, going beyond the wall—but he"
10651,BOOK XVIII.,did not join the Achaeans for he heeded the charge which his
10652,BOOK XVIII.,mother laid upon him.
10653,BOOK XVIII.,
10654,BOOK XVIII.,There did he stand and shout aloud. Minerva also raised her voice
10655,BOOK XVIII.,"from afar, and spread terror unspeakable among the Trojans."
10656,BOOK XVIII.,Ringing as the note of a trumpet that sounds alarm then the foe
10657,BOOK XVIII.,"is at the gates of a city, even so brazen was the voice of the"
10658,BOOK XVIII.,"son of Aeacus, and when the Trojans heard its clarion tones they"
10659,BOOK XVIII.,were dismayed; the horses turned back with their chariots for
10660,BOOK XVIII.,"they boded mischief, and their drivers were awe-struck by the"
10661,BOOK XVIII.,steady flame which the grey-eyed goddess had kindled above the
10662,BOOK XVIII.,head of the great son of Peleus.
10663,BOOK XVIII.,
10664,BOOK XVIII.,"Thrice did Achilles raise his loud cry as he stood by the trench,"
10665,BOOK XVIII.,and thrice were the Trojans and their brave allies thrown into
10666,BOOK XVIII.,confusion; whereon twelve of their noblest champions fell beneath
10667,BOOK XVIII.,the wheels of their chariots and perished by their own spears.
10668,BOOK XVIII.,The Achaeans to their great joy then drew Patroclus out of reach
10669,BOOK XVIII.,"of the weapons, and laid him on a litter: his comrades stood"
10670,BOOK XVIII.,"mourning round him, and among them fleet Achilles who wept"
10671,BOOK XVIII.,bitterly as he saw his true comrade lying dead upon his bier. He
10672,BOOK XVIII.,"had sent him out with horses and chariots into battle, but his"
10673,BOOK XVIII.,return he was not to welcome.
10674,BOOK XVIII.,
10675,BOOK XVIII.,"Then Juno sent the busy sun, loth though he was, into the waters"
10676,BOOK XVIII.,"of Oceanus; so he set, and the Achaeans had rest from the tug and"
10677,BOOK XVIII.,turmoil of war.
10678,BOOK XVIII.,
10679,BOOK XVIII.,"Now the Trojans when they had come out of the fight, unyoked"
10680,BOOK XVIII.,their horses and gathered in assembly before preparing their
10681,BOOK XVIII.,"supper. They kept their feet, nor would any dare to sit down, for"
10682,BOOK XVIII.,fear had fallen upon them all because Achilles had shown himself
10683,BOOK XVIII.,after having held aloof so long from battle. Polydamas son of
10684,BOOK XVIII.,"Panthous was first to speak, a man of judgement, who alone among"
10685,BOOK XVIII.,"them could look both before and after. He was comrade to Hector,"
10686,BOOK XVIII.,and they had been born upon the same night; with all sincerity
10687,BOOK XVIII.,"and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:—"
10688,BOOK XVIII.,
10689,BOOK XVIII.,"“Look to it well, my friends; I would urge you to go back now to"
10690,BOOK XVIII.,"your city and not wait here by the ships till morning, for we are"
10691,BOOK XVIII.,far from our walls. So long as this man was at enmity with
10692,BOOK XVIII.,"Agamemnon the Achaeans were easier to deal with, and I would have"
10693,BOOK XVIII.,gladly camped by the ships in the hope of taking them; but now I
10694,BOOK XVIII.,go in great fear of the fleet son of Peleus; he is so daring that
10695,BOOK XVIII.,he will never bide here on the plain whereon the Trojans and
10696,BOOK XVIII.,"Achaeans fight with equal valour, but he will try to storm our"
10697,BOOK XVIII.,"city and carry off our women. Do then as I say, and let us"
10698,BOOK XVIII.,retreat. For this is what will happen. The darkness of night will
10699,BOOK XVIII.,"for a time stay the son of Peleus, but if he find us here in the"
10700,BOOK XVIII.,"morning when he sallies forth in full armour, we shall have"
10701,BOOK XVIII.,knowledge of him in good earnest. Glad indeed will he be who can
10702,BOOK XVIII.,"escape and get back to Ilius, and many a Trojan will become meat"
10703,BOOK XVIII.,for dogs and vultures may I never live to hear it. If we do as I
10704,BOOK XVIII.,"say, little though we may like it, we shall have strength in"
10705,BOOK XVIII.,"counsel during the night, and the great gates with the doors that"
10706,BOOK XVIII.,close them will protect the city. At dawn we can arm and take our
10707,BOOK XVIII.,stand on the walls; he will then rue it if he sallies from the
10708,BOOK XVIII.,ships to fight us. He will go back when he has given his horses
10709,BOOK XVIII.,"their fill of being driven all whithers under our walls, and will"
10710,BOOK XVIII.,be in no mind to try and force his way into the city. Neither
10711,BOOK XVIII.,"will he ever sack it, dogs shall devour him ere he do so.”"
10712,BOOK XVIII.,
10713,BOOK XVIII.,"Hector looked fiercely at him and answered, “Polydamas, your"
10714,BOOK XVIII.,words are not to my liking in that you bid us go back and be pent
10715,BOOK XVIII.,within the city. Have you not had enough of being cooped up
10716,BOOK XVIII.,behind walls? In the old-days the city of Priam was famous the
10717,BOOK XVIII.,"whole world over for its wealth of gold and bronze, but our"
10718,BOOK XVIII.,"treasures are wasted out of our houses, and much goods have been"
10719,BOOK XVIII.,"sold away to Phrygia and fair Meonia, for the hand of Jove has"
10720,BOOK XVIII.,"been laid heavily upon us. Now, therefore, that the son of"
10721,BOOK XVIII.,scheming Saturn has vouchsafed me to win glory here and to hem
10722,BOOK XVIII.,"the Achaeans in at their ships, prate no more in this fool’s wise"
10723,BOOK XVIII.,among the people. You will have no man with you; it shall not be;
10724,BOOK XVIII.,do all of you as I now say;—take your suppers in your companies
10725,BOOK XVIII.,"throughout the host, and keep your watches and be wakeful every"
10726,BOOK XVIII.,"man of you. If any Trojan is uneasy about his possessions, let"
10727,BOOK XVIII.,him gather them and give them out among the people. Better let
10728,BOOK XVIII.,"these, rather than the Achaeans, have them. At daybreak we will"
10729,BOOK XVIII.,arm and fight about the ships; granted that Achilles has again
10730,BOOK XVIII.,"come forward to defend them, let it be as he will, but it shall"
10731,BOOK XVIII.,"go hard with him. I shall not shun him, but will fight him, to"
10732,BOOK XVIII.,"fall or conquer. The god of war deals out like measure to all,"
10733,BOOK XVIII.,and the slayer may yet be slain.”
10734,BOOK XVIII.,
10735,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus spoke Hector; and the Trojans, fools that they were, shouted"
10736,BOOK XVIII.,"in applause, for Pallas Minerva had robbed them of their"
10737,BOOK XVIII.,"understanding. They gave ear to Hector with his evil counsel, but"
10738,BOOK XVIII.,the wise words of Polydamas no man would heed. They took their
10739,BOOK XVIII.,"supper throughout the host, and meanwhile through the whole night"
10740,BOOK XVIII.,"the Achaeans mourned Patroclus, and the son of Peleus led them in"
10741,BOOK XVIII.,their lament. He laid his murderous hands upon the breast of his
10742,BOOK XVIII.,"comrade, groaning again and again as a bearded lion when a man"
10743,BOOK XVIII.,who was chasing deer has robbed him of his young in some dense
10744,BOOK XVIII.,"forest; when the lion comes back he is furious, and searches"
10745,BOOK XVIII.,"dingle and dell to track the hunter if he can find him, for he is"
10746,BOOK XVIII.,mad with rage—even so with many a sigh did Achilles speak among
10747,BOOK XVIII.,"the Myrmidons saying, “Alas! vain were the words with which I"
10748,BOOK XVIII.,cheered the hero Menoetius in his own house; I said that I would
10749,BOOK XVIII.,bring his brave son back again to Opoeis after he had sacked
10750,BOOK XVIII.,Ilius and taken his share of the spoils—but Jove does not give
10751,BOOK XVIII.,all men their heart’s desire. The same soil shall be reddened
10752,BOOK XVIII.,"here at Troy by the blood of us both, for I too shall never be"
10753,BOOK XVIII.,"welcomed home by the old knight Peleus, nor by my mother Thetis,"
10754,BOOK XVIII.,"but even in this place shall the earth cover me. Nevertheless, O"
10755,BOOK XVIII.,"Patroclus, now that I am left behind you, I will not bury you,"
10756,BOOK XVIII.,till I have brought hither the head and armour of mighty Hector
10757,BOOK XVIII.,who has slain you. Twelve noble sons of Trojans will I behead
10758,BOOK XVIII.,before your bier to avenge you; till I have done so you shall lie
10759,BOOK XVIII.,"as you are by the ships, and fair women of Troy and Dardanus,"
10760,BOOK XVIII.,whom we have taken with spear and strength of arm when we sacked
10761,BOOK XVIII.,"men’s goodly cities, shall weep over you both night and day.”"
10762,BOOK XVIII.,
10763,BOOK XVIII.,Then Achilles told his men to set a large tripod upon the fire
10764,BOOK XVIII.,that they might wash the clotted gore from off Patroclus. Thereon
10765,BOOK XVIII.,they set a tripod full of bath water on to a clear fire: they
10766,BOOK XVIII.,"threw sticks on to it to make it blaze, and the water became hot"
10767,BOOK XVIII.,as the flame played about the belly of the tripod. When the water
10768,BOOK XVIII.,"in the cauldron was boiling they washed the body, anointed it"
10769,BOOK XVIII.,"with oil, and closed its wounds with ointment that had been kept"
10770,BOOK XVIII.,nine years. Then they laid it on a bier and covered it with a
10771,BOOK XVIII.,"linen cloth from head to foot, and over this they laid a fair"
10772,BOOK XVIII.,white robe. Thus all night long did the Myrmidons gather round
10773,BOOK XVIII.,Achilles to mourn Patroclus.
10774,BOOK XVIII.,
10775,BOOK XVIII.,"Then Jove said to Juno his sister-wife, “So, Queen Juno, you have"
10776,BOOK XVIII.,"gained your end, and have roused fleet Achilles. One would think"
10777,BOOK XVIII.,that the Achaeans were of your own flesh and blood.”
10778,BOOK XVIII.,
10779,BOOK XVIII.,"And Juno answered, “Dread son of Saturn, why should you say this"
10780,BOOK XVIII.,thing? May not a man though he be only mortal and knows less than
10781,BOOK XVIII.,"we do, do what he can for another person? And shall not"
10782,BOOK XVIII.,I—foremost of all goddesses both by descent and as wife to you
10783,BOOK XVIII.,who reign in heaven—devise evil for the Trojans if I am angry
10784,BOOK XVIII.,with them?”
10785,BOOK XVIII.,
10786,BOOK XVIII.,Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Thetis came to the house of
10787,BOOK XVIII.,"Vulcan, imperishable, star-bespangled, fairest of the abodes in"
10788,BOOK XVIII.,"heaven, a house of bronze wrought by the lame god’s own hands."
10789,BOOK XVIII.,"She found him busy with his bellows, sweating and hard at work,"
10790,BOOK XVIII.,for he was making twenty tripods that were to stand by the wall
10791,BOOK XVIII.,"of his house, and he set wheels of gold under them all that they"
10792,BOOK XVIII.,"might go of their own selves to the assemblies of the gods, and"
10793,BOOK XVIII.,come back again—marvels indeed to see. They were finished all but
10794,BOOK XVIII.,the ears of cunning workmanship which yet remained to be fixed to
10795,BOOK XVIII.,"them: these he was now fixing, and he was hammering at the"
10796,BOOK XVIII.,rivets. While he was thus at work silver-footed Thetis came to
10797,BOOK XVIII.,"the house. Charis, of graceful head-dress, wife to the far-famed"
10798,BOOK XVIII.,"lame god, came towards her as soon as she saw her, and took her"
10799,BOOK XVIII.,"hand in her own, saying, “Why have you come to our house, Thetis,"
10800,BOOK XVIII.,honoured and ever welcome—for you do not visit us often? Come
10801,BOOK XVIII.,inside and let me set refreshment before you.”
10802,BOOK XVIII.,
10803,BOOK XVIII.,"The goddess led the way as she spoke, and bade Thetis sit on a"
10804,BOOK XVIII.,richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a footstool
10805,BOOK XVIII.,"also under her feet. Then she called Vulcan and said, “Vulcan,"
10806,BOOK XVIII.,"come here, Thetis wants you”; and the far-famed lame god"
10807,BOOK XVIII.,"answered, “Then it is indeed an august and honoured goddess who"
10808,BOOK XVIII.,has come here; she it was that took care of me when I was
10809,BOOK XVIII.,suffering from the heavy fall which I had through my cruel
10810,BOOK XVIII.,mother’s anger—for she would have got rid of me because I was
10811,BOOK XVIII.,"lame. It would have gone hardly with me had not Eurynome,"
10812,BOOK XVIII.,"daughter of the ever-encircling waters of Oceanus, and Thetis,"
10813,BOOK XVIII.,"taken me to their bosom. Nine years did I stay with them, and"
10814,BOOK XVIII.,"many beautiful works in bronze, brooches, spiral armlets, cups,"
10815,BOOK XVIII.,"and chains, did I make for them in their cave, with the roaring"
10816,BOOK XVIII.,waters of Oceanus foaming as they rushed ever past it; and no one
10817,BOOK XVIII.,"knew, neither of gods nor men, save only Thetis and Eurynome who"
10818,BOOK XVIII.,"took care of me. If, then, Thetis has come to my house I must"
10819,BOOK XVIII.,"make her due requital for having saved me; entertain her,"
10820,BOOK XVIII.,"therefore, with all hospitality, while I put by my bellows and"
10821,BOOK XVIII.,all my tools.”
10822,BOOK XVIII.,
10823,BOOK XVIII.,"On this the mighty monster hobbled off from his anvil, his thin"
10824,BOOK XVIII.,legs plying lustily under him. He set the bellows away from the
10825,BOOK XVIII.,"fire, and gathered his tools into a silver chest. Then he took a"
10826,BOOK XVIII.,"sponge and washed his face and hands, his shaggy chest and brawny"
10827,BOOK XVIII.,"neck; he donned his shirt, grasped his strong staff, and limped"
10828,BOOK XVIII.,towards the door. There were golden handmaids also who worked for
10829,BOOK XVIII.,"him, and were like real young women, with sense and reason, voice"
10830,BOOK XVIII.,"also and strength, and all the learning of the immortals; these"
10831,BOOK XVIII.,"busied themselves as the king bade them, while he drew near to"
10832,BOOK XVIII.,"Thetis, seated her upon a goodly seat, and took her hand in his"
10833,BOOK XVIII.,"own, saying, “Why have you come to our house, Thetis honoured and"
10834,BOOK XVIII.,"ever welcome—for you do not visit us often? Say what you want,"
10835,BOOK XVIII.,"and I will do it for you at once if I can, and if it can be done"
10836,BOOK XVIII.,at all.”
10837,BOOK XVIII.,
10838,BOOK XVIII.,"Thetis wept and answered, “Vulcan, is there another goddess in"
10839,BOOK XVIII.,Olympus whom the son of Saturn has been pleased to try with so
10840,BOOK XVIII.,much affliction as he has me? Me alone of the marine goddesses
10841,BOOK XVIII.,"did he make subject to a mortal husband, Peleus son of Aeacus,"
10842,BOOK XVIII.,and sorely against my will did I submit to the embraces of one
10843,BOOK XVIII.,"who was but mortal, and who now stays at home worn out with age."
10844,BOOK XVIII.,"Neither is this all. Heaven vouchsafed me a son, hero among"
10845,BOOK XVIII.,"heroes, and he shot up as a sapling. I tended him as a plant in a"
10846,BOOK XVIII.,goodly garden and sent him with his ships to Ilius to fight the
10847,BOOK XVIII.,"Trojans, but never shall I welcome him back to the house of"
10848,BOOK XVIII.,"Peleus. So long as he lives to look upon the light of the sun, he"
10849,BOOK XVIII.,"is in heaviness, and though I go to him I cannot help him; King"
10850,BOOK XVIII.,Agamemnon has made him give up the maiden whom the sons of the
10851,BOOK XVIII.,"Achaeans had awarded him, and he wastes with sorrow for her sake."
10852,BOOK XVIII.,Then the Trojans hemmed the Achaeans in at their ships’ sterns
10853,BOOK XVIII.,"and would not let them come forth; the elders, therefore, of the"
10854,BOOK XVIII.,"Argives besought Achilles and offered him great treasure, whereon"
10855,BOOK XVIII.,"he refused to bring deliverance to them himself, but put his own"
10856,BOOK XVIII.,armour on Patroclus and sent him into the fight with much people
10857,BOOK XVIII.,after him. All day long they fought by the Scaean gates and would
10858,BOOK XVIII.,"have taken the city there and then, had not Apollo vouchsafed"
10859,BOOK XVIII.,glory to Hector and slain the valiant son of Menoetius after he
10860,BOOK XVIII.,had done the Trojans much evil. Therefore I am suppliant at your
10861,BOOK XVIII.,"knees if haply you may be pleased to provide my son, whose end is"
10862,BOOK XVIII.,"near at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly greaves fitted"
10863,BOOK XVIII.,"with ancle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost his own"
10864,BOOK XVIII.,"when his true comrade fell at the hands of the Trojans, and he"
10865,BOOK XVIII.,now lies stretched on earth in the bitterness of his soul.”
10866,BOOK XVIII.,
10867,BOOK XVIII.,"And Vulcan answered, “Take heart, and be no more disquieted about"
10868,BOOK XVIII.,this matter; would that I could hide him from death’s sight when
10869,BOOK XVIII.,"his hour is come, so surely as I can find him armour that shall"
10870,BOOK XVIII.,amaze the eyes of all who behold it.”
10871,BOOK XVIII.,
10872,BOOK XVIII.,"When he had so said he left her and went to his bellows, turning"
10873,BOOK XVIII.,them towards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty
10874,BOOK XVIII.,"bellows blew upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every"
10875,BOOK XVIII.,"kind, some fierce to help him when he had need of them, and"
10876,BOOK XVIII.,others less strong as Vulcan willed it in the course of his work.
10877,BOOK XVIII.,"He threw tough copper into the fire, and tin, with silver and"
10878,BOOK XVIII.,"gold; he set his great anvil on its block, and with one hand"
10879,BOOK XVIII.,grasped his mighty hammer while he took the tongs in the other.
10880,BOOK XVIII.,
10881,BOOK XVIII.,"First he shaped the shield so great and strong, adorning it all"
10882,BOOK XVIII.,over and binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three
10883,BOOK XVIII.,layers; and the baldric was made of silver. He made the shield in
10884,BOOK XVIII.,"five thicknesses, and with many a wonder did his cunning hand"
10885,BOOK XVIII.,enrich it.
10886,BOOK XVIII.,
10887,BOOK XVIII.,"He wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea; the moon also at"
10888,BOOK XVIII.,"her full and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify"
10889,BOOK XVIII.,"the face of heaven—the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the"
10890,BOOK XVIII.,"Bear, which men also call the Wain and which turns round ever in"
10891,BOOK XVIII.,"one place, facing Orion, and alone never dips into the stream of"
10892,BOOK XVIII.,Oceanus.
10893,BOOK XVIII.,
10894,BOOK XVIII.,"He wrought also two cities, fair to see and busy with the hum of"
10895,BOOK XVIII.,"men. In the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they were"
10896,BOOK XVIII.,going about the city with brides whom they were escorting by
10897,BOOK XVIII.,"torchlight from their chambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and"
10898,BOOK XVIII.,"the youths danced to the music of flute and lyre, while the women"
10899,BOOK XVIII.,stood each at her house door to see them.
10900,BOOK XVIII.,
10901,BOOK XVIII.,"Meanwhile the people were gathered in assembly, for there was a"
10902,BOOK XVIII.,"quarrel, and two men were wrangling about the blood-money for a"
10903,BOOK XVIII.,"man who had been killed, the one saying before the people that he"
10904,BOOK XVIII.,"had paid damages in full, and the other that he had not been"
10905,BOOK XVIII.,"paid. Each was trying to make his own case good, and the people"
10906,BOOK XVIII.,"took sides, each man backing the side that he had taken; but the"
10907,BOOK XVIII.,"heralds kept them back, and the elders sate on their seats of"
10908,BOOK XVIII.,"stone in a solemn circle, holding the staves which the heralds"
10909,BOOK XVIII.,had put into their hands. Then they rose and each in his turn
10910,BOOK XVIII.,"gave judgement, and there were two talents laid down, to be given"
10911,BOOK XVIII.,to him whose judgement should be deemed the fairest.
10912,BOOK XVIII.,
10913,BOOK XVIII.,About the other city there lay encamped two hosts in gleaming
10914,BOOK XVIII.,"armour, and they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare it"
10915,BOOK XVIII.,and accept the half of what it contained. But the men of the city
10916,BOOK XVIII.,"would not yet consent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their"
10917,BOOK XVIII.,"wives and little children kept guard upon the walls, and with"
10918,BOOK XVIII.,them were the men who were past fighting through age; but the
10919,BOOK XVIII.,others sallied forth with Mars and Pallas Minerva at their
10920,BOOK XVIII.,"head—both of them wrought in gold and clad in golden raiment,"
10921,BOOK XVIII.,"great and fair with their armour as befitting gods, while they"
10922,BOOK XVIII.,that followed were smaller. When they reached the place where
10923,BOOK XVIII.,"they would lay their ambush, it was on a riverbed to which live"
10924,BOOK XVIII.,"stock of all kinds would come from far and near to water; here,"
10925,BOOK XVIII.,"then, they lay concealed, clad in full armour. Some way off them"
10926,BOOK XVIII.,there were two scouts who were on the look-out for the coming of
10927,BOOK XVIII.,"sheep or cattle, which presently came, followed by two shepherds"
10928,BOOK XVIII.,"who were playing on their pipes, and had not so much as a thought"
10929,BOOK XVIII.,"of danger. When those who were in ambush saw this, they cut off"
10930,BOOK XVIII.,the flocks and herds and killed the shepherds. Meanwhile the
10931,BOOK XVIII.,"besiegers, when they heard much noise among the cattle as they"
10932,BOOK XVIII.,"sat in council, sprang to their horses, and made with all speed"
10933,BOOK XVIII.,towards them; when they reached them they set battle in array by
10934,BOOK XVIII.,"the banks of the river, and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod"
10935,BOOK XVIII.,"spears at one another. With them were Strife and Riot, and fell"
10936,BOOK XVIII.,"Fate who was dragging three men after her, one with a fresh"
10937,BOOK XVIII.,"wound, and the other unwounded, while the third was dead, and she"
10938,BOOK XVIII.,was dragging him along by his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled
10939,BOOK XVIII.,in men’s blood. They went in and out with one another and fought
10940,BOOK XVIII.,as though they were living people haling away one another’s dead.
10941,BOOK XVIII.,
10942,BOOK XVIII.,"He wrought also a fair fallow field, large and thrice ploughed"
10943,BOOK XVIII.,"already. Many men were working at the plough within it, turning"
10944,BOOK XVIII.,"their oxen to and fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they"
10945,BOOK XVIII.,turned on reaching the headland a man would come up to them and
10946,BOOK XVIII.,"give them a cup of wine, and they would go back to their furrows"
10947,BOOK XVIII.,looking forward to the time when they should again reach the
10948,BOOK XVIII.,"headland. The part that they had ploughed was dark behind them,"
10949,BOOK XVIII.,"so that the field, though it was of gold, still looked as if it"
10950,BOOK XVIII.,were being ploughed—very curious to behold.
10951,BOOK XVIII.,
10952,BOOK XVIII.,"He wrought also a field of harvest corn, and the reapers were"
10953,BOOK XVIII.,reaping with sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe
10954,BOOK XVIII.,"fell to the ground in a straight line behind them, and the"
10955,BOOK XVIII.,binders bound them in bands of twisted straw. There were three
10956,BOOK XVIII.,"binders, and behind them there were boys who gathered the cut"
10957,BOOK XVIII.,corn in armfuls and kept on bringing them to be bound: among them
10958,BOOK XVIII.,all the owner of the land stood by in silence and was glad. The
10959,BOOK XVIII.,"servants were getting a meal ready under an oak, for they had"
10960,BOOK XVIII.,"sacrificed a great ox, and were busy cutting him up, while the"
10961,BOOK XVIII.,women were making a porridge of much white barley for the
10962,BOOK XVIII.,labourers’ dinner.
10963,BOOK XVIII.,
10964,BOOK XVIII.,"He wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to see, and the vines"
10965,BOOK XVIII.,"were loaded with grapes. The bunches overhead were black, but the"
10966,BOOK XVIII.,vines were trained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark
10967,BOOK XVIII.,"metal all round it, and fenced it with a fence of tin; there was"
10968,BOOK XVIII.,"only one path to it, and by this the vintagers went when they"
10969,BOOK XVIII.,would gather the vintage. Youths and maidens all blithe and full
10970,BOOK XVIII.,"of glee, carried the luscious fruit in plaited baskets; and with"
10971,BOOK XVIII.,"them there went a boy who made sweet music with his lyre, and"
10972,BOOK XVIII.,sang the Linos-song with his clear boyish voice.
10973,BOOK XVIII.,
10974,BOOK XVIII.,He wrought also a herd of horned cattle. He made the cows of gold
10975,BOOK XVIII.,"and tin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of the yards"
10976,BOOK XVIII.,to go and feed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of
10977,BOOK XVIII.,"the river. Along with the cattle there went four shepherds, all"
10978,BOOK XVIII.,"of them in gold, and their nine fleet dogs went with them. Two"
10979,BOOK XVIII.,terrible lions had fastened on a bellowing bull that was with the
10980,BOOK XVIII.,"foremost cows, and bellow as he might they haled him, while the"
10981,BOOK XVIII.,dogs and men gave chase: the lions tore through the bull’s thick
10982,BOOK XVIII.,"hide and were gorging on his blood and bowels, but the herdsmen"
10983,BOOK XVIII.,"were afraid to do anything, and only hounded on their dogs; the"
10984,BOOK XVIII.,dogs dared not fasten on the lions but stood by barking and
10985,BOOK XVIII.,keeping out of harm’s way.
10986,BOOK XVIII.,
10987,BOOK XVIII.,"The god wrought also a pasture in a fair mountain dell, and a"
10988,BOOK XVIII.,"large flock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and sheltered"
10989,BOOK XVIII.,sheepfolds.
10990,BOOK XVIII.,
10991,BOOK XVIII.,"Furthermore he wrought a green, like that which Daedalus once"
10992,BOOK XVIII.,made in Cnossus for lovely Ariadne. Hereon there danced youths
10993,BOOK XVIII.,"and maidens whom all would woo, with their hands on one another’s"
10994,BOOK XVIII.,"wrists. The maidens wore robes of light linen, and the youths"
10995,BOOK XVIII.,well woven shirts that were slightly oiled. The girls were
10996,BOOK XVIII.,"crowned with garlands, while the young men had daggers of gold"
10997,BOOK XVIII.,that hung by silver baldrics; sometimes they would dance deftly
10998,BOOK XVIII.,"in a ring with merry twinkling feet, as it were a potter sitting"
10999,BOOK XVIII.,at his work and making trial of his wheel to see whether it will
11000,BOOK XVIII.,"run, and sometimes they would go all in line with one another,"
11001,BOOK XVIII.,and much people was gathered joyously about the green. There was
11002,BOOK XVIII.,"a bard also to sing to them and play his lyre, while two tumblers"
11003,BOOK XVIII.,went about performing in the midst of them when the man struck up
11004,BOOK XVIII.,with his tune.
11005,BOOK XVIII.,
11006,BOOK XVIII.,All round the outermost rim of the shield he set the mighty
11007,BOOK XVIII.,stream of the river Oceanus.
11008,BOOK XVIII.,
11009,BOOK XVIII.,"Then when he had fashioned the shield so great and strong, he"
11010,BOOK XVIII.,made a breastplate also that shone brighter than fire. He made a
11011,BOOK XVIII.,"helmet, close fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a"
11012,BOOK XVIII.,golden plume overhanging it; and he made greaves also of beaten
11013,BOOK XVIII.,tin.
11014,BOOK XVIII.,
11015,BOOK XVIII.,"Lastly, when the famed lame god had made all the armour, he took"
11016,BOOK XVIII.,it and set it before the mother of Achilles; whereon she darted
11017,BOOK XVIII.,like a falcon from the snowy summits of Olympus and bore away the
11018,BOOK XVIII.,gleaming armour from the house of Vulcan.
11019,BOOK XVIII.,

11024,BOOK XIX.,
11025,BOOK XIX.,
11026,BOOK XIX.,"Achilles is reconciled with Agamemnon, puts on the armour which"
11027,BOOK XIX.,"Vulcan had made him, and goes out to fight."
11028,BOOK XIX.,
11029,BOOK XIX.,Now when Dawn in robe of saffron was hasting from the streams of
11030,BOOK XIX.,"Oceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached"
11031,BOOK XIX.,the ships with the armour that the god had given her. She found
11032,BOOK XIX.,her son fallen about the body of Patroclus and weeping bitterly.
11033,BOOK XIX.,"Many also of his followers were weeping round him, but when the"
11034,BOOK XIX.,"goddess came among them she clasped his hand in her own, saying,"
11035,BOOK XIX.,"“My son, grieve as we may we must let this man lie, for it is by"
11036,BOOK XIX.,"heaven’s will that he has fallen; now, therefore, accept from"
11037,BOOK XIX.,"Vulcan this rich and goodly armour, which no man has ever yet"
11038,BOOK XIX.,borne upon his shoulders.”
11039,BOOK XIX.,
11040,BOOK XIX.,"As she spoke she set the armour before Achilles, and it rang out"
11041,BOOK XIX.,"bravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and"
11042,BOOK XIX.,"none dared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles"
11043,BOOK XIX.,"was roused to still greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a"
11044,BOOK XIX.,"fierce light, for he was glad when he handled the splendid"
11045,BOOK XIX.,"present which the god had made him. Then, as soon as he had"
11046,BOOK XIX.,"satisfied himself with looking at it, he said to his mother,"
11047,BOOK XIX.,"“Mother, the god has given me armour, meet handiwork for an"
11048,BOOK XIX.,immortal and such as no-one living could have fashioned; I will
11049,BOOK XIX.,"now arm, but I much fear that flies will settle upon the son of"
11050,BOOK XIX.,"Menoetius and breed worms about his wounds, so that his body, now"
11051,BOOK XIX.,"he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.”"
11052,BOOK XIX.,
11053,BOOK XIX.,"Silver-footed Thetis answered, “My son, be not disquieted about"
11054,BOOK XIX.,this matter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms of
11055,BOOK XIX.,noisome flies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed
11056,BOOK XIX.,"in battle. He may lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still"
11057,BOOK XIX.,"be as sound as ever, or even sounder. Call, therefore, the"
11058,BOOK XIX.,Achaean heroes in assembly; unsay your anger against Agamemnon;
11059,BOOK XIX.,"arm at once, and fight with might and main.”"
11060,BOOK XIX.,
11061,BOOK XIX.,"As she spoke she put strength and courage into his heart, and she"
11062,BOOK XIX.,then dropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of
11063,BOOK XIX.,"Patroclus, that his body might suffer no change."
11064,BOOK XIX.,
11065,BOOK XIX.,"Then Achilles went out upon the sea-shore, and with a loud cry"
11066,BOOK XIX.,called on the Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had
11067,BOOK XIX.,"stayed always at the ships, the pilots and helmsmen, and even the"
11068,BOOK XIX.,"stewards who were about the ships and served out rations, all"
11069,BOOK XIX.,came to the place of assembly because Achilles had shown himself
11070,BOOK XIX.,"after having held aloof so long from fighting. Two sons of Mars,"
11071,BOOK XIX.,"Ulysses and the son of Tydeus, came limping, for their wounds"
11072,BOOK XIX.,"still pained them; nevertheless they came, and took their seats"
11073,BOOK XIX.,"in the front row of the assembly. Last of all came Agamemnon,"
11074,BOOK XIX.,"king of men, he too wounded, for Coon son of Antenor had struck"
11075,BOOK XIX.,him with a spear in battle.
11076,BOOK XIX.,
11077,BOOK XIX.,"When the Achaeans were got together Achilles rose and said, “Son"
11078,BOOK XIX.,"of Atreus, surely it would have been better alike for both you"
11079,BOOK XIX.,"and me, when we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely"
11080,BOOK XIX.,"it would have been better, had Diana’s arrow slain her at the"
11081,BOOK XIX.,ships on the day when I took her after having sacked Lyrnessus.
11082,BOOK XIX.,"For so, many an Achaean the less would have bitten dust before"
11083,BOOK XIX.,the foe in the days of my anger. It has been well for Hector and
11084,BOOK XIX.,"the Trojans, but the Achaeans will long indeed remember our"
11085,BOOK XIX.,"quarrel. Now, however, let it be, for it is over. If we have been"
11086,BOOK XIX.,"angry, necessity has schooled our anger. I put it from me: I dare"
11087,BOOK XIX.,"not nurse it for ever; therefore, bid the Achaeans arm forthwith"
11088,BOOK XIX.,"that I may go out against the Trojans, and learn whether they"
11089,BOOK XIX.,"will be in a mind to sleep by the ships or no. Glad, I ween, will"
11090,BOOK XIX.,he be to rest his knees who may fly my spear when I wield it.”
11091,BOOK XIX.,
11092,BOOK XIX.,"Thus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in that he had put"
11093,BOOK XIX.,away his anger.
11094,BOOK XIX.,
11095,BOOK XIX.,"Then Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the"
11096,BOOK XIX.,"middle of the assembly. “Danaan heroes,” said he, “servants of"
11097,BOOK XIX.,"Mars, it is well to listen when a man stands up to speak, and it"
11098,BOOK XIX.,"is not seemly to interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a"
11099,BOOK XIX.,practised speaker. Who can either hear or speak in an uproar?
11100,BOOK XIX.,Even the finest orator will be disconcerted by it. I will expound
11101,BOOK XIX.,"to the son of Peleus, and do you other Achaeans heed me and mark"
11102,BOOK XIX.,me well. Often have the Achaeans spoken to me of this matter and
11103,BOOK XIX.,"upbraided me, but it was not I that did it: Jove, and Fate, and"
11104,BOOK XIX.,Erinys that walks in darkness struck me mad when we were
11105,BOOK XIX.,assembled on the day that I took from Achilles the meed that had
11106,BOOK XIX.,been awarded to him. What could I do? All things are in the hand
11107,BOOK XIX.,"of heaven, and Folly, eldest of Jove’s daughters, shuts men’s"
11108,BOOK XIX.,"eyes to their destruction. She walks delicately, not on the solid"
11109,BOOK XIX.,"earth, but hovers over the heads of men to make them stumble or"
11110,BOOK XIX.,to ensnare them.
11111,BOOK XIX.,
11112,BOOK XIX.,"“Time was when she fooled Jove himself, who they say is greatest"
11113,BOOK XIX.,"whether of gods or men; for Juno, woman though she was, beguiled"
11114,BOOK XIX.,him on the day when Alcmena was to bring forth mighty Hercules in
11115,BOOK XIX.,"the fair city of Thebes. He told it out among the gods saying,"
11116,BOOK XIX.,"‘Hear me, all gods and goddesses, that I may speak even as I am"
11117,BOOK XIX.,"minded; this day shall an Ilithuia, helper of women who are in"
11118,BOOK XIX.,"labour, bring a man child into the world who shall be lord over"
11119,BOOK XIX.,all that dwell about him who are of my blood and lineage.’ Then
11120,BOOK XIX.,"said Juno all crafty and full of guile, ‘You will play false, and"
11121,BOOK XIX.,"will not hold to your word. Swear me, O Olympian, swear me a"
11122,BOOK XIX.,"great oath, that he who shall this day fall between the feet of a"
11123,BOOK XIX.,"woman, shall be lord over all that dwell about him who are of"
11124,BOOK XIX.,your blood and lineage.’
11125,BOOK XIX.,
11126,BOOK XIX.,"“Thus she spoke, and Jove suspected her not, but swore the great"
11127,BOOK XIX.,"oath, to his much ruing thereafter. For Juno darted down from the"
11128,BOOK XIX.,"high summit of Olympus, and went in haste to Achaean Argos where"
11129,BOOK XIX.,she knew that the noble wife of Sthenelus son of Perseus then
11130,BOOK XIX.,"was. She being with child and in her seventh month, Juno brought"
11131,BOOK XIX.,"the child to birth though there was a month still wanting, but"
11132,BOOK XIX.,"she stayed the offspring of Alcmena, and kept back the Ilithuiae."
11133,BOOK XIX.,"Then she went to tell Jove the son of Saturn, and said, ‘Father"
11134,BOOK XIX.,"Jove, lord of the lightning—I have a word for your ear. There is"
11135,BOOK XIX.,"a fine child born this day, Eurystheus, son to Sthenelus the son"
11136,BOOK XIX.,"of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well, therefore, that he"
11137,BOOK XIX.,should reign over the Argives.’
11138,BOOK XIX.,
11139,BOOK XIX.,"“On this Jove was stung to the very quick, and in his rage he"
11140,BOOK XIX.,"caught Folly by the hair, and swore a great oath that never"
11141,BOOK XIX.,"should she again invade starry heaven and Olympus, for she was"
11142,BOOK XIX.,the bane of all. Then he whirled her round with a twist of his
11143,BOOK XIX.,"hand, and flung her down from heaven so that she fell on to the"
11144,BOOK XIX.,fields of mortal men; and he was ever angry with her when he saw
11145,BOOK XIX.,his son groaning under the cruel labours that Eurystheus laid
11146,BOOK XIX.,upon him. Even so did I grieve when mighty Hector was killing the
11147,BOOK XIX.,"Argives at their ships, and all the time I kept thinking of Folly"
11148,BOOK XIX.,"who had so baned me. I was blind, and Jove robbed me of my"
11149,BOOK XIX.,"reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much treasure by"
11150,BOOK XIX.,"way of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your people"
11151,BOOK XIX.,with you. I will give you all that Ulysses offered you yesterday
11152,BOOK XIX.,"in your tents: or if it so please you, wait, though you would"
11153,BOOK XIX.,"fain fight at once, and my squires shall bring the gifts from my"
11154,BOOK XIX.,"ship, that you may see whether what I give you is enough.”"
11155,BOOK XIX.,
11156,BOOK XIX.,"And Achilles answered, “Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, you"
11157,BOOK XIX.,"can give such gifts as you think proper, or you can withhold"
11158,BOOK XIX.,them: it is in your own hands. Let us now set battle in array; it
11159,BOOK XIX.,"is not well to tarry talking about trifles, for there is a deed"
11160,BOOK XIX.,which is as yet to do. Achilles shall again be seen fighting
11161,BOOK XIX.,"among the foremost, and laying low the ranks of the Trojans: bear"
11162,BOOK XIX.,this in mind each one of you when he is fighting.”
11163,BOOK XIX.,
11164,BOOK XIX.,"Then Ulysses said, “Achilles, godlike and brave, send not the"
11165,BOOK XIX.,"Achaeans thus against Ilius to fight the Trojans fasting, for the"
11166,BOOK XIX.,"battle will be no brief one, when it is once begun, and heaven"
11167,BOOK XIX.,has filled both sides with fury; bid them first take food both
11168,BOOK XIX.,"bread and wine by the ships, for in this there is strength and"
11169,BOOK XIX.,stay. No man can do battle the livelong day to the going down of
11170,BOOK XIX.,the sun if he is without food; however much he may want to fight
11171,BOOK XIX.,his strength will fail him before he knows it; hunger and thirst
11172,BOOK XIX.,"will find him out, and his limbs will grow weary under him. But a"
11173,BOOK XIX.,man can fight all day if he is full fed with meat and wine; his
11174,BOOK XIX.,"heart beats high, and his strength will stay till he has routed"
11175,BOOK XIX.,"all his foes; therefore, send the people away and bid them"
11176,BOOK XIX.,prepare their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts in
11177,BOOK XIX.,"presence of the assembly, that all may see them and you may be"
11178,BOOK XIX.,satisfied. Moreover let him swear an oath before the Argives that
11179,BOOK XIX.,"he has never gone up into the couch of Briseis, nor been with her"
11180,BOOK XIX.,"after the manner of men and women; and do you, too, show yourself"
11181,BOOK XIX.,of a gracious mind; let Agamemnon entertain you in his tents with
11182,BOOK XIX.,"a feast of reconciliation, that so you may have had your dues in"
11183,BOOK XIX.,"full. As for you, son of Atreus, treat people more righteously in"
11184,BOOK XIX.,future; it is no disgrace even to a king that he should make
11185,BOOK XIX.,amends if he was wrong in the first instance.”
11186,BOOK XIX.,
11187,BOOK XIX.,"And King Agamemnon answered, “Son of Laertes, your words please"
11188,BOOK XIX.,"me well, for throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as"
11189,BOOK XIX.,"you would have me do; I do so of my own free will, neither shall"
11190,BOOK XIX.,"I take the name of heaven in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait,"
11191,BOOK XIX.,"though he would fain fight at once, and do you others wait also,"
11192,BOOK XIX.,till the gifts come from my tent and we ratify the oath with
11193,BOOK XIX.,"sacrifice. Thus, then, do I charge you: take some noble young"
11194,BOOK XIX.,"Achaeans with you, and bring from my tents the gifts that I"
11195,BOOK XIX.,"promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring the women also;"
11196,BOOK XIX.,furthermore let Talthybius find me a boar from those that are
11197,BOOK XIX.,"with the host, and make it ready for sacrifice to Jove and to the"
11198,BOOK XIX.,sun.”
11199,BOOK XIX.,
11200,BOOK XIX.,"Then said Achilles, “Son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, see to"
11201,BOOK XIX.,"these matters at some other season, when there is breathing time"
11202,BOOK XIX.,and when I am calmer. Would you have men eat while the bodies of
11203,BOOK XIX.,those whom Hector son of Priam slew are still lying mangled upon
11204,BOOK XIX.,"the plain? Let the sons of the Achaeans, say I, fight fasting and"
11205,BOOK XIX.,"without food, till we have avenged them; afterwards at the going"
11206,BOOK XIX.,"down of the sun let them eat their fill. As for me, Patroclus is"
11207,BOOK XIX.,"lying dead in my tent, all hacked and hewn, with his feet to the"
11208,BOOK XIX.,"door, and his comrades are mourning round him. Therefore I can"
11209,BOOK XIX.,take thought of nothing save only slaughter and blood and the
11210,BOOK XIX.,rattle in the throat of the dying.”
11211,BOOK XIX.,
11212,BOOK XIX.,"Ulysses answered, “Achilles, son of Peleus, mightiest of all the"
11213,BOOK XIX.,"Achaeans, in battle you are better than I, and that more than a"
11214,BOOK XIX.,"little, but in counsel I am much before you, for I am older and"
11215,BOOK XIX.,of greater knowledge. Therefore be patient under my words.
11216,BOOK XIX.,"Fighting is a thing of which men soon surfeit, and when Jove, who"
11217,BOOK XIX.,"is war’s steward, weighs the upshot, it may well prove that the"
11218,BOOK XIX.,straw which our sickles have reaped is far heavier than the
11219,BOOK XIX.,grain. It may not be that the Achaeans should mourn the dead with
11220,BOOK XIX.,their bellies; day by day men fall thick and threefold
11221,BOOK XIX.,continually; when should we have respite from our sorrow? Let us
11222,BOOK XIX.,"mourn our dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, but"
11223,BOOK XIX.,let those of us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and
11224,BOOK XIX.,"fight our foes more fiercely. In that hour let no man hold back,"
11225,BOOK XIX.,waiting for a second summons; such summons shall bode ill for him
11226,BOOK XIX.,who is found lagging behind at our ships; let us rather sally as
11227,BOOK XIX.,one man and loose the fury of war upon the Trojans.”
11228,BOOK XIX.,
11229,BOOK XIX.,"When he had thus spoken he took with him the sons of Nestor, with"
11230,BOOK XIX.,"Meges son of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lycomedes son of Creontes,"
11231,BOOK XIX.,"and Melanippus, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus."
11232,BOOK XIX.,The word was not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought
11233,BOOK XIX.,"out the seven tripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the"
11234,BOOK XIX.,twenty metal cauldrons and the twelve horses; they also brought
11235,BOOK XIX.,"the women skilled in useful arts, seven in number, with Briseis,"
11236,BOOK XIX.,which made eight. Ulysses weighed out the ten talents of gold and
11237,BOOK XIX.,"then led the way back, while the young Achaeans brought the rest"
11238,BOOK XIX.,"of the gifts, and laid them in the middle of the assembly."
11239,BOOK XIX.,
11240,BOOK XIX.,"Agamemnon then rose, and Talthybius whose voice was like that of"
11241,BOOK XIX.,a god came to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the knife
11242,BOOK XIX.,"which he wore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by"
11243,BOOK XIX.,"cutting off some bristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in"
11244,BOOK XIX.,prayer as he did so. The other Achaeans sat where they were all
11245,BOOK XIX.,"silent and orderly to hear the king, and Agamemnon looked into"
11246,BOOK XIX.,"the vault of heaven and prayed saying, “I call Jove the first and"
11247,BOOK XIX.,"mightiest of all gods to witness, I call also Earth and Sun and"
11248,BOOK XIX.,the Erinyes who dwell below and take vengeance on him who shall
11249,BOOK XIX.,"swear falsely, that I have laid no hand upon the girl Briseis,"
11250,BOOK XIX.,"neither to take her to my bed nor otherwise, but that she has"
11251,BOOK XIX.,remained in my tents inviolate. If I swear falsely may heaven
11252,BOOK XIX.,visit me with all the penalties which it metes out to those who
11253,BOOK XIX.,perjure themselves.”
11254,BOOK XIX.,
11255,BOOK XIX.,"He cut the boar’s throat as he spoke, whereon Talthybius whirled"
11256,BOOK XIX.,"it round his head, and flung it into the wide sea to feed the"
11257,BOOK XIX.,"fishes. Then Achilles also rose and said to the Argives, “Father"
11258,BOOK XIX.,"Jove, of a truth you blind men’s eyes and bane them. The son of"
11259,BOOK XIX.,"Atreus had not else stirred me to so fierce an anger, nor so"
11260,BOOK XIX.,stubbornly taken Briseis from me against my will. Surely Jove
11261,BOOK XIX.,"must have counselled the destruction of many an Argive. Go, now,"
11262,BOOK XIX.,and take your food that we may begin fighting.”
11263,BOOK XIX.,
11264,BOOK XIX.,"On this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back to his"
11265,BOOK XIX.,own ship. The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them
11266,BOOK XIX.,"away to the ship of Achilles. They placed them in his tents,"
11267,BOOK XIX.,while the stable-men drove the horses in among the others.
11268,BOOK XIX.,
11269,BOOK XIX.,"Briseis, fair as Venus, when she saw the mangled body of"
11270,BOOK XIX.,"Patroclus, flung herself upon it and cried aloud, tearing her"
11271,BOOK XIX.,"breast, her neck, and her lovely face with both her hands."
11272,BOOK XIX.,"Beautiful as a goddess she wept and said, “Patroclus, dearest"
11273,BOOK XIX.,"friend, when I went hence I left you living; I return, O prince,"
11274,BOOK XIX.,to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows multiply upon me one
11275,BOOK XIX.,after the other. I saw him to whom my father and mother married
11276,BOOK XIX.,"me, cut down before our city, and my three own dear brothers"
11277,BOOK XIX.,"perished with him on the self-same day; but you, Patroclus, even"
11278,BOOK XIX.,"when Achilles slew my husband and sacked the city of noble Mynes,"
11279,BOOK XIX.,"told me that I was not to weep, for you said you would make"
11280,BOOK XIX.,"Achilles marry me, and take me back with him to Phthia, we should"
11281,BOOK XIX.,have a wedding feast among the Myrmidons. You were always kind to
11282,BOOK XIX.,me and I shall never cease to grieve for you.”
11283,BOOK XIX.,
11284,BOOK XIX.,"She wept as she spoke, and the women joined in her lament-making"
11285,BOOK XIX.,"as though their tears were for Patroclus, but in truth each was"
11286,BOOK XIX.,weeping for her own sorrows. The elders of the Achaeans gathered
11287,BOOK XIX.,"round Achilles and prayed him to take food, but he groaned and"
11288,BOOK XIX.,"would not do so. “I pray you,” said he, “if any comrade will hear"
11289,BOOK XIX.,"me, bid me neither eat nor drink, for I am in great heaviness,"
11290,BOOK XIX.,and will stay fasting even to the going down of the sun.”
11291,BOOK XIX.,
11292,BOOK XIX.,"On this he sent the other princes away, save only the two sons of"
11293,BOOK XIX.,"Atreus and Ulysses, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the knight Phoenix,"
11294,BOOK XIX.,who stayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of
11295,BOOK XIX.,his sorrow: but he would not be comforted till he should have
11296,BOOK XIX.,"flung himself into the jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on"
11297,BOOK XIX.,"sigh, thinking ever of Patroclus. Then he said—"
11298,BOOK XIX.,
11299,BOOK XIX.,"“Hapless and dearest comrade, you it was who would get a good"
11300,BOOK XIX.,dinner ready for me at once and without delay when the Achaeans
11301,BOOK XIX.,"were hasting to fight the Trojans; now, therefore, though I have"
11302,BOOK XIX.,"meat and drink in my tents, yet will I fast for sorrow. Grief"
11303,BOOK XIX.,"greater than this I could not know, not even though I were to"
11304,BOOK XIX.,"hear of the death of my father, who is now in Phthia weeping for"
11305,BOOK XIX.,"the loss of me his son, who am here fighting the Trojans in a"
11306,BOOK XIX.,"strange land for the accursed sake of Helen, nor yet though I"
11307,BOOK XIX.,should hear that my son is no more—he who is being brought up in
11308,BOOK XIX.,Scyros—if indeed Neoptolemus is still living. Till now I made
11309,BOOK XIX.,"sure that I alone was to fall here at Troy away from Argos, while"
11310,BOOK XIX.,"you were to return to Phthia, bring back my son with you in your"
11311,BOOK XIX.,"own ship, and show him all my property, my bondsmen, and the"
11312,BOOK XIX.,"greatness of my house—for Peleus must surely be either dead, or"
11313,BOOK XIX.,what little life remains to him is oppressed alike with the
11314,BOOK XIX.,infirmities of age and ever present fear lest he should hear the
11315,BOOK XIX.,sad tidings of my death.”
11316,BOOK XIX.,
11317,BOOK XIX.,"He wept as he spoke, and the elders sighed in concert as each"
11318,BOOK XIX.,thought on what he had left at home behind him. The son of Saturn
11319,BOOK XIX.,"looked down with pity upon them, and said presently to Minerva,"
11320,BOOK XIX.,"“My child, you have quite deserted your hero; is he then gone so"
11321,BOOK XIX.,clean out of your recollection? There he sits by the ships all
11322,BOOK XIX.,"desolate for the loss of his dear comrade, and though the others"
11323,BOOK XIX.,are gone to their dinner he will neither eat nor drink. Go then
11324,BOOK XIX.,"and drop nectar and ambrosia into his breast, that he may know no"
11325,BOOK XIX.,hunger.”
11326,BOOK XIX.,
11327,BOOK XIX.,"With these words he urged Minerva, who was already of the same"
11328,BOOK XIX.,mind. She darted down from heaven into the air like some falcon
11329,BOOK XIX.,sailing on his broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans
11330,BOOK XIX.,"were arming throughout the host, and when Minerva had dropped"
11331,BOOK XIX.,nectar and ambrosia into Achilles so that no cruel hunger should
11332,BOOK XIX.,"cause his limbs to fail him, she went back to the house of her"
11333,BOOK XIX.,mighty father. Thick as the chill snow-flakes shed from the hand
11334,BOOK XIX.,"of Jove and borne on the keen blasts of the north wind, even so"
11335,BOOK XIX.,"thick did the gleaming helmets, the bossed shields, the strongly"
11336,BOOK XIX.,"plated breastplates, and the ashen spears stream from the ships."
11337,BOOK XIX.,"The sheen pierced the sky, the whole land was radiant with their"
11338,BOOK XIX.,"flashing armour, and the sound of the tramp of their treading"
11339,BOOK XIX.,rose from under their feet. In the midst of them all Achilles put
11340,BOOK XIX.,"on his armour; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes gleamed like fire,"
11341,BOOK XIX.,"for his grief was greater than he could bear. Thus, then, full of"
11342,BOOK XIX.,"fury against the Trojans, did he don the gift of the god, the"
11343,BOOK XIX.,armour that Vulcan had made him.
11344,BOOK XIX.,
11345,BOOK XIX.,"First he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle-clasps, and"
11346,BOOK XIX.,next he did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the
11347,BOOK XIX.,"silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took"
11348,BOOK XIX.,up the shield so great and strong that shone afar with a
11349,BOOK XIX.,splendour as of the moon. As the light seen by sailors from out
11350,BOOK XIX.,"at sea, when men have lit a fire in their homestead high up among"
11351,BOOK XIX.,"the mountains, but the sailors are carried out to sea by wind and"
11352,BOOK XIX.,storm far from the haven where they would be—even so did the
11353,BOOK XIX.,gleam of Achilles’ wondrous shield strike up into the heavens. He
11354,BOOK XIX.,"lifted the redoubtable helmet, and set it upon his head, from"
11355,BOOK XIX.,"whence it shone like a star, and the golden plumes which Vulcan"
11356,BOOK XIX.,"had set thick about the ridge of the helmet, waved all around it."
11357,BOOK XIX.,Then Achilles made trial of himself in his armour to see whether
11358,BOOK XIX.,"it fitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under it, and"
11359,BOOK XIX.,it seemed to buoy him up as though it had been wings.
11360,BOOK XIX.,
11361,BOOK XIX.,"He also drew his father’s spear out of the spear-stand, a spear"
11362,BOOK XIX.,so great and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans save only
11363,BOOK XIX.,Achilles had strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian
11364,BOOK XIX.,"ash from the topmost ridges of Mt. Pelion, which Chiron had once"
11365,BOOK XIX.,"given to Peleus, fraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and"
11366,BOOK XIX.,Alcimus busied themselves with the harnessing of his horses; they
11367,BOOK XIX.,"made the bands fast about them, and put the bit in their mouths,"
11368,BOOK XIX.,"drawing the reins back towards the chariot. Automedon, whip in"
11369,BOOK XIX.,"hand, sprang up behind the horses, and after him Achilles mounted"
11370,BOOK XIX.,"in full armour, resplendent as the sun-god Hyperion. Then with a"
11371,BOOK XIX.,"loud voice he chided with his father’s horses saying, “Xanthus"
11372,BOOK XIX.,"and Balius, famed offspring of Podarge—this time when we have"
11373,BOOK XIX.,done fighting be sure and bring your driver safely back to the
11374,BOOK XIX.,"host of the Achaeans, and do not leave him dead on the plain as"
11375,BOOK XIX.,you did Patroclus.”
11376,BOOK XIX.,
11377,BOOK XIX.,Then fleet Xanthus answered under the yoke—for white-armed Juno
11378,BOOK XIX.,had endowed him with human speech—and he bowed his head till his
11379,BOOK XIX.,mane touched the ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band.
11380,BOOK XIX.,"“Dread Achilles,” said he, “we will indeed save you now, but the"
11381,BOOK XIX.,"day of your death is near, and the blame will not be ours, for it"
11382,BOOK XIX.,will be heaven and stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was
11383,BOOK XIX.,it through any sloth or slackness on our part that the Trojans
11384,BOOK XIX.,stripped Patroclus of his armour; it was the mighty god whom
11385,BOOK XIX.,"lovely Leto bore that slew him as he fought among the foremost,"
11386,BOOK XIX.,and vouchsafed a triumph to Hector. We two can fly as swiftly as
11387,BOOK XIX.,Zephyrus who they say is fleetest of all winds; nevertheless it
11388,BOOK XIX.,is your doom to fall by the hand of a man and of a god.”
11389,BOOK XIX.,
11390,BOOK XIX.,"When he had thus said the Erinyes stayed his speech, and Achilles"
11391,BOOK XIX.,"answered him in great sadness, saying, “Why, O Xanthus, do you"
11392,BOOK XIX.,"thus foretell my death? You need not do so, for I well know that"
11393,BOOK XIX.,"I am to fall here, far from my dear father and mother; none the"
11394,BOOK XIX.,"more, however, shall I stay my hand till I have given the Trojans"
11395,BOOK XIX.,their fill of fighting.”
11396,BOOK XIX.,
11397,BOOK XIX.,"So saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses to the front."

11405,BOOK XX.,"The gods hold a council and determine to watch the fight, from"
11406,BOOK XX.,"the hill Callicolone, and the barrow of Hercules—A fight between"
11407,BOOK XX.,"Achilles and AEneas is interrupted by Neptune, who saves"
11408,BOOK XX.,AEneas—Achilles kills many Trojans.
11409,BOOK XX.,
11410,BOOK XX.,"Thus, then, did the Achaeans arm by their ships round you, O son"
11411,BOOK XX.,"of Peleus, who were hungering for battle; while the Trojans over"
11412,BOOK XX.,against them armed upon the rise of the plain.
11413,BOOK XX.,
11414,BOOK XX.,"Meanwhile Jove from the top of many-delled Olympus, bade Themis"
11415,BOOK XX.,"gather the gods in council, whereon she went about and called"
11416,BOOK XX.,them to the house of Jove. There was not a river absent except
11417,BOOK XX.,"Oceanus, nor a single one of the nymphs that haunt fair groves,"
11418,BOOK XX.,or springs of rivers and meadows of green grass. When they
11419,BOOK XX.,"reached the house of cloud-compelling Jove, they took their seats"
11420,BOOK XX.,in the arcades of polished marble which Vulcan with his
11421,BOOK XX.,consummate skill had made for father Jove.
11422,BOOK XX.,
11423,BOOK XX.,"In such wise, therefore, did they gather in the house of Jove."
11424,BOOK XX.,"Neptune also, lord of the earthquake, obeyed the call of the"
11425,BOOK XX.,"goddess, and came up out of the sea to join them. There, sitting"
11426,BOOK XX.,"in the midst of them, he asked what Jove’s purpose might be."
11427,BOOK XX.,"“Why,” said he, “wielder of the lightning, have you called the"
11428,BOOK XX.,gods in council? Are you considering some matter that concerns
11429,BOOK XX.,the Trojans and Achaeans—for the blaze of battle is on the point
11430,BOOK XX.,of being kindled between them?”
11431,BOOK XX.,
11432,BOOK XX.,"And Jove answered, “You know my purpose, shaker of earth, and"
11433,BOOK XX.,wherefore I have called you hither. I take thought for them even
11434,BOOK XX.,in their destruction. For my own part I shall stay here seated on
11435,BOOK XX.,"Mt. Olympus and look on in peace, but do you others go about"
11436,BOOK XX.,"among Trojans and Achaeans, and help either side as you may be"
11437,BOOK XX.,severally disposed. If Achilles fights the Trojans without
11438,BOOK XX.,hindrance they will make no stand against him; they have ever
11439,BOOK XX.,"trembled at the sight of him, and now that he is roused to such"
11440,BOOK XX.,"fury about his comrade, he will override fate itself and storm"
11441,BOOK XX.,their city.”
11442,BOOK XX.,
11443,BOOK XX.,"Thus spoke Jove and gave the word for war, whereon the gods took"
11444,BOOK XX.,"their several sides and went into battle. Juno, Pallas Minerva,"
11445,BOOK XX.,"earth-encircling Neptune, Mercury bringer of good luck and"
11446,BOOK XX.,excellent in all cunning—all these joined the host that came from
11447,BOOK XX.,"the ships; with them also came Vulcan in all his glory, limping,"
11448,BOOK XX.,but yet with his thin legs plying lustily under him. Mars of
11449,BOOK XX.,"gleaming helmet joined the Trojans, and with him Apollo of locks"
11450,BOOK XX.,"unshorn, and the archer goddess Diana, Leto, Xanthus, and"
11451,BOOK XX.,laughter-loving Venus.
11452,BOOK XX.,
11453,BOOK XX.,So long as the gods held themselves aloof from mortal warriors
11454,BOOK XX.,"the Achaeans were triumphant, for Achilles who had long refused"
11455,BOOK XX.,to fight was now with them. There was not a Trojan but his limbs
11456,BOOK XX.,failed him for fear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all
11457,BOOK XX.,"glorious in his armour, and looking like Mars himself. When,"
11458,BOOK XX.,"however, the Olympians came to take their part among men,"
11459,BOOK XX.,"forthwith uprose strong Strife, rouser of hosts, and Minerva"
11460,BOOK XX.,"raised her loud voice, now standing by the deep trench that ran"
11461,BOOK XX.,"outside the wall, and now shouting with all her might upon the"
11462,BOOK XX.,shore of the sounding sea. Mars also bellowed out upon the other
11463,BOOK XX.,"side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called on the Trojans"
11464,BOOK XX.,"at the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and now speeding"
11465,BOOK XX.,up the side of the river Simois till he came to the hill
11466,BOOK XX.,Callicolone.
11467,BOOK XX.,
11468,BOOK XX.,"Thus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight, and rouse fierce"
11469,BOOK XX.,contention also among themselves. The sire of gods and men
11470,BOOK XX.,"thundered from heaven above, while from beneath Neptune shook the"
11471,BOOK XX.,"vast earth, and bade the high hills tremble. The spurs and crests"
11472,BOOK XX.,"of many-fountained Ida quaked, as also the city of the Trojans"
11473,BOOK XX.,"and the ships of the Achaeans. Hades, king of the realms below,"
11474,BOOK XX.,was struck with fear; he sprang panic-stricken from his throne
11475,BOOK XX.,"and cried aloud in terror lest Neptune, lord of the earthquake,"
11476,BOOK XX.,"should crack the ground over his head, and lay bare his mouldy"
11477,BOOK XX.,mansions to the sight of mortals and immortals—mansions so
11478,BOOK XX.,ghastly grim that even the gods shudder to think of them. Such
11479,BOOK XX.,was the uproar as the gods came together in battle. Apollo with
11480,BOOK XX.,"his arrows took his stand to face King Neptune, while Minerva"
11481,BOOK XX.,took hers against the god of war; the archer goddess Diana with
11482,BOOK XX.,"her golden arrows, sister of far-darting Apollo, stood to face"
11483,BOOK XX.,"Juno; Mercury the lusty bringer of good luck faced Leto, while"
11484,BOOK XX.,"the mighty eddying river whom men can Scamander, but gods"
11485,BOOK XX.,"Xanthus, matched himself against Vulcan."
11486,BOOK XX.,
11487,BOOK XX.,"The gods, then, were thus ranged against one another. But the"
11488,BOOK XX.,"heart of Achilles was set on meeting Hector son of Priam, for it"
11489,BOOK XX.,was with his blood that he longed above all things else to glut
11490,BOOK XX.,the stubborn lord of battle. Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to
11491,BOOK XX.,"attack the son of Peleus, and put courage into his heart,"
11492,BOOK XX.,speaking with the voice of Lycaon son of Priam. In his likeness
11493,BOOK XX.,"therefore, he said to Aeneas, “Aeneas, counsellor of the Trojans,"
11494,BOOK XX.,where are now the brave words with which you vaunted over your
11495,BOOK XX.,"wine before the Trojan princes, saying that you would fight"
11496,BOOK XX.,Achilles son of Peleus in single combat?”
11497,BOOK XX.,
11498,BOOK XX.,"And Aeneas answered, “Why do you thus bid me fight the proud son"
11499,BOOK XX.,"of Peleus, when I am in no mind to do so? Were I to face him now,"
11500,BOOK XX.,it would not be for the first time. His spear has already put me
11501,BOOK XX.,"to flight from Ida, when he attacked our cattle and sacked"
11502,BOOK XX.,Lyrnessus and Pedasus; Jove indeed saved me in that he vouchsafed
11503,BOOK XX.,"me strength to fly, else had I fallen by the hands of Achilles"
11504,BOOK XX.,"and Minerva, who went before him to protect him and urged him to"
11505,BOOK XX.,"fall upon the Lelegae and Trojans. No man may fight Achilles, for"
11506,BOOK XX.,"one of the gods is always with him as his guardian angel, and"
11507,BOOK XX.,"even were it not so, his weapon flies ever straight, and fails"
11508,BOOK XX.,not to pierce the flesh of him who is against him; if heaven
11509,BOOK XX.,would let me fight him on even terms he should not soon overcome
11510,BOOK XX.,"me, though he boasts that he is made of bronze.”"
11511,BOOK XX.,
11512,BOOK XX.,"Then said King Apollo, son to Jove, “Nay, hero, pray to the"
11513,BOOK XX.,"ever-living gods, for men say that you were born of Jove’s"
11514,BOOK XX.,"daughter Venus, whereas Achilles is son to a goddess of inferior"
11515,BOOK XX.,"rank. Venus is child to Jove, while Thetis is but daughter to the"
11516,BOOK XX.,"old man of the sea. Bring, therefore, your spear to bear upon"
11517,BOOK XX.,"him, and let him not scare you with his taunts and menaces.”"
11518,BOOK XX.,
11519,BOOK XX.,As he spoke he put courage into the heart of the shepherd of his
11520,BOOK XX.,"people, and he strode in full armour among the ranks of the"
11521,BOOK XX.,foremost fighters. Nor did the son of Anchises escape the notice
11522,BOOK XX.,"of white-armed Juno, as he went forth into the throng to meet"
11523,BOOK XX.,"Achilles. She called the gods about her, and said, “Look to it,"
11524,BOOK XX.,"you two, Neptune and Minerva, and consider how this shall be;"
11525,BOOK XX.,Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas clad in full armour to
11526,BOOK XX.,"fight Achilles. Shall we turn him back at once, or shall one of"
11527,BOOK XX.,us stand by Achilles and endow him with strength so that his
11528,BOOK XX.,"heart fail not, and he may learn that the chiefs of the immortals"
11529,BOOK XX.,"are on his side, while the others who have all along been"
11530,BOOK XX.,defending the Trojans are but vain helpers? Let us all come down
11531,BOOK XX.,"from Olympus and join in the fight, that this day he may take no"
11532,BOOK XX.,hurt at the hands of the Trojans. Hereafter let him suffer
11533,BOOK XX.,whatever fate may have spun out for him when he was begotten and
11534,BOOK XX.,his mother bore him. If Achilles be not thus assured by the voice
11535,BOOK XX.,"of a god, he may come to fear presently when one of us meets him"
11536,BOOK XX.,"in battle, for the gods are terrible if they are seen face to"
11537,BOOK XX.,face.”
11538,BOOK XX.,
11539,BOOK XX.,"Neptune lord of the earthquake answered her saying, “Juno,"
11540,BOOK XX.,restrain your fury; it is not well; I am not in favour of forcing
11541,BOOK XX.,"the other gods to fight us, for the advantage is too greatly on"
11542,BOOK XX.,our own side; let us take our places on some hill out of the
11543,BOOK XX.,"beaten track, and let mortals fight it out among themselves. If"
11544,BOOK XX.,"Mars or Phoebus Apollo begin fighting, or keep Achilles in check"
11545,BOOK XX.,"so that he cannot fight, we too, will at once raise the cry of"
11546,BOOK XX.,"battle, and in that case they will soon leave the field and go"
11547,BOOK XX.,back vanquished to Olympus among the other gods.”
11548,BOOK XX.,
11549,BOOK XX.,With these words the dark-haired god led the way to the high
11550,BOOK XX.,"earth-barrow of Hercules, built round solid masonry, and made by"
11551,BOOK XX.,the Trojans and Pallas Minerva for him to fly to when the
11552,BOOK XX.,sea-monster was chasing him from the shore on to the plain. Here
11553,BOOK XX.,"Neptune and those that were with him took their seats, wrapped in"
11554,BOOK XX.,a thick cloud of darkness; but the other gods seated themselves
11555,BOOK XX.,"on the brow of Callicolone round you, O Phoebus, and Mars the"
11556,BOOK XX.,waster of cities.
11557,BOOK XX.,
11558,BOOK XX.,"Thus did the gods sit apart and form their plans, but neither"
11559,BOOK XX.,"side was willing to begin battle with the other, and Jove from"
11560,BOOK XX.,his seat on high was in command over them all. Meanwhile the
11561,BOOK XX.,"whole plain was alive with men and horses, and blazing with the"
11562,BOOK XX.,gleam of armour. The earth rang again under the tramp of their
11563,BOOK XX.,"feet as they rushed towards each other, and two champions, by far"
11564,BOOK XX.,"the foremost of them all, met between the hosts to fight—to wit,"
11565,BOOK XX.,"Aeneas son of Anchises, and noble Achilles."
11566,BOOK XX.,
11567,BOOK XX.,"Aeneas was first to stride forward in attack, his doughty helmet"
11568,BOOK XX.,tossing defiance as he came on. He held his strong shield before
11569,BOOK XX.,"his breast, and brandished his bronze spear. The son of Peleus"
11570,BOOK XX.,"from the other side sprang forth to meet him, like some fierce"
11571,BOOK XX.,lion that the whole country-side has met to hunt and kill—at
11572,BOOK XX.,"first he bodes no ill, but when some daring youth has struck him"
11573,BOOK XX.,"with a spear, he crouches openmouthed, his jaws foam, he roars"
11574,BOOK XX.,"with fury, he lashes his tail from side to side about his ribs"
11575,BOOK XX.,"and loins, and glares as he springs straight before him, to find"
11576,BOOK XX.,"out whether he is to slay, or be slain among the foremost of his"
11577,BOOK XX.,foes—even with such fury did Achilles burn to spring upon Aeneas.
11578,BOOK XX.,
11579,BOOK XX.,When they were now close up with one another Achilles was first
11580,BOOK XX.,"to speak. “Aeneas,” said he, “why do you stand thus out before"
11581,BOOK XX.,the host to fight me? Is it that you hope to reign over the
11582,BOOK XX.,"Trojans in the seat of Priam? Nay, though you kill me Priam will"
11583,BOOK XX.,"not hand his kingdom over to you. He is a man of sound judgement,"
11584,BOOK XX.,and he has sons of his own. Or have the Trojans been allotting
11585,BOOK XX.,"you a demesne of passing richness, fair with orchard lawns and"
11586,BOOK XX.,"corn lands, if you should slay me? This you shall hardly do. I"
11587,BOOK XX.,have discomfited you once already. Have you forgotten how when
11588,BOOK XX.,you were alone I chased you from your herds helter-skelter down
11589,BOOK XX.,the slopes of Ida? You did not turn round to look behind you; you
11590,BOOK XX.,"took refuge in Lyrnessus, but I attacked the city, and with the"
11591,BOOK XX.,help of Minerva and father Jove I sacked it and carried its women
11592,BOOK XX.,"into captivity, though Jove and the other gods rescued you. You"
11593,BOOK XX.,"think they will protect you now, but they will not do so;"
11594,BOOK XX.,"therefore I say go back into the host, and do not face me, or you"
11595,BOOK XX.,will rue it. Even a fool may be wise after the event.”
11596,BOOK XX.,
11597,BOOK XX.,"Then Aeneas answered, “Son of Peleus, think not that your words"
11598,BOOK XX.,"can scare me as though I were a child. I too, if I will, can brag"
11599,BOOK XX.,and talk unseemly. We know one another’s race and parentage as
11600,BOOK XX.,"matters of common fame, though neither have you ever seen my"
11601,BOOK XX.,"parents nor I yours. Men say that you are son to noble Peleus,"
11602,BOOK XX.,"and that your mother is Thetis, fair-haired daughter of the sea."
11603,BOOK XX.,"I have noble Anchises for my father, and Venus for my mother; the"
11604,BOOK XX.,"parents of one or other of us shall this day mourn a son, for it"
11605,BOOK XX.,will be more than silly talk that shall part us when the fight is
11606,BOOK XX.,"over. Learn, then, my lineage if you will—and it is known to"
11607,BOOK XX.,many.
11608,BOOK XX.,
11609,BOOK XX.,"“In the beginning Dardanus was the son of Jove, and founded"
11610,BOOK XX.,"Dardania, for Ilius was not yet stablished on the plain for men"
11611,BOOK XX.,"to dwell in, and her people still abode on the spurs of"
11612,BOOK XX.,"many-fountained Ida. Dardanus had a son, king Erichthonius, who"
11613,BOOK XX.,was wealthiest of all men living; he had three thousand mares
11614,BOOK XX.,"that fed by the water-meadows, they and their foals with them."
11615,BOOK XX.,"Boreas was enamoured of them as they were feeding, and covered"
11616,BOOK XX.,them in the semblance of a dark-maned stallion. Twelve filly
11617,BOOK XX.,"foals did they conceive and bear him, and these, as they sped"
11618,BOOK XX.,"over the rich plain, would go bounding on over the ripe ears of"
11619,BOOK XX.,corn and not break them; or again when they would disport
11620,BOOK XX.,themselves on the broad back of Ocean they could gallop on the
11621,BOOK XX.,"crest of a breaker. Erichthonius begat Tros, king of the Trojans,"
11622,BOOK XX.,"and Tros had three noble sons, Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede who"
11623,BOOK XX.,was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the gods carried him off
11624,BOOK XX.,"to be Jove’s cup-bearer, for his beauty’s sake, that he might"
11625,BOOK XX.,"dwell among the immortals. Ilus begat Laomedon, and Laomedon"
11626,BOOK XX.,"begat Tithonus, Priam, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon of the stock"
11627,BOOK XX.,"of Mars. But Assaracus was father to Capys, and Capys to"
11628,BOOK XX.,"Anchises, who was my father, while Hector is son to Priam."
11629,BOOK XX.,
11630,BOOK XX.,"“Such do I declare my blood and lineage, but as for valour, Jove"
11631,BOOK XX.,"gives it or takes it as he will, for he is lord of all. And now"
11632,BOOK XX.,let there be no more of this prating in mid-battle as though we
11633,BOOK XX.,were children. We could fling taunts without end at one another;
11634,BOOK XX.,a hundred-oared galley would not hold them. The tongue can run
11635,BOOK XX.,"all whithers and talk all wise; it can go here and there, and as"
11636,BOOK XX.,"a man says, so shall he be gainsaid. What is the use of our"
11637,BOOK XX.,bandying hard like women who when they fall foul of one another
11638,BOOK XX.,"go out and wrangle in the streets, one half true and the other"
11639,BOOK XX.,"lies, as rage inspires them? No words of yours shall turn me now"
11640,BOOK XX.,that I am fain to fight—therefore let us make trial of one
11641,BOOK XX.,another with our spears.”
11642,BOOK XX.,
11643,BOOK XX.,As he spoke he drove his spear at the great and terrible shield
11644,BOOK XX.,"of Achilles, which rang out as the point struck it. The son of"
11645,BOOK XX.,"Peleus held the shield before him with his strong hand, and he"
11646,BOOK XX.,"was afraid, for he deemed that Aeneas’s spear would go through it"
11647,BOOK XX.,"quite easily, not reflecting that the god’s glorious gifts were"
11648,BOOK XX.,little likely to yield before the blows of mortal men; and indeed
11649,BOOK XX.,"Aeneas’s spear did not pierce the shield, for the layer of gold,"
11650,BOOK XX.,"gift of the god, stayed the point. It went through two layers,"
11651,BOOK XX.,"but the god had made the shield in five, two of bronze, the two"
11652,BOOK XX.,"innermost ones of tin, and one of gold; it was in this that the"
11653,BOOK XX.,spear was stayed.
11654,BOOK XX.,
11655,BOOK XX.,"Achilles in his turn threw, and struck the round shield of Aeneas"
11656,BOOK XX.,"at the very edge, where the bronze was thinnest; the spear of"
11657,BOOK XX.,"Pelian ash went clean through, and the shield rang under the"
11658,BOOK XX.,"blow; Aeneas was afraid, and crouched backwards, holding the"
11659,BOOK XX.,"shield away from him; the spear, however, flew over his back, and"
11660,BOOK XX.,"stuck quivering in the ground, after having gone through both"
11661,BOOK XX.,circles of the sheltering shield. Aeneas though he had avoided
11662,BOOK XX.,"the spear, stood still, blinded with fear and grief because the"
11663,BOOK XX.,weapon had gone so near him; then Achilles sprang furiously upon
11664,BOOK XX.,"him, with a cry as of death and with his keen blade drawn, and"
11665,BOOK XX.,"Aeneas seized a great stone, so huge that two men, as men now"
11666,BOOK XX.,"are, would be unable to lift it, but Aeneas wielded it quite"
11667,BOOK XX.,easily.
11668,BOOK XX.,
11669,BOOK XX.,Aeneas would then have struck Achilles as he was springing
11670,BOOK XX.,"towards him, either on the helmet, or on the shield that covered"
11671,BOOK XX.,"him, and Achilles would have closed with him and despatched him"
11672,BOOK XX.,"with his sword, had not Neptune lord of the earthquake been quick"
11673,BOOK XX.,"to mark, and said forthwith to the immortals, “Alas, I am sorry"
11674,BOOK XX.,"for great Aeneas, who will now go down to the house of Hades,"
11675,BOOK XX.,vanquished by the son of Peleus. Fool that he was to give ear to
11676,BOOK XX.,the counsel of Apollo. Apollo will never save him from
11677,BOOK XX.,"destruction. Why should this man suffer when he is guiltless, to"
11678,BOOK XX.,"no purpose, and in another’s quarrel? Has he not at all times"
11679,BOOK XX.,offered acceptable sacrifice to the gods that dwell in heaven?
11680,BOOK XX.,"Let us then snatch him from death’s jaws, lest the son of Saturn"
11681,BOOK XX.,"be angry should Achilles slay him. It is fated, moreover, that he"
11682,BOOK XX.,"should escape, and that the race of Dardanus, whom Jove loved"
11683,BOOK XX.,"above all the sons born to him of mortal women, shall not perish"
11684,BOOK XX.,utterly without seed or sign. For now indeed has Jove hated the
11685,BOOK XX.,"blood of Priam, while Aeneas shall reign over the Trojans, he and"
11686,BOOK XX.,his children’s children that shall be born hereafter.”
11687,BOOK XX.,
11688,BOOK XX.,"Then answered Juno, “Earth-shaker, look to this matter yourself,"
11689,BOOK XX.,"and consider concerning Aeneas, whether you will save him, or"
11690,BOOK XX.,"suffer him, brave though he be, to fall by the hand of Achilles"
11691,BOOK XX.,"son of Peleus. For of a truth we two, I and Pallas Minerva, have"
11692,BOOK XX.,"sworn full many a time before all the immortals, that never would"
11693,BOOK XX.,"we shield Trojans from destruction, not even when all Troy is"
11694,BOOK XX.,burning in the flames that the Achaeans shall kindle.”
11695,BOOK XX.,
11696,BOOK XX.,When earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went into the battle
11697,BOOK XX.,"amid the clash of spears, and came to the place where Achilles"
11698,BOOK XX.,and Aeneas were. Forthwith he shed a darkness before the eyes of
11699,BOOK XX.,"the son of Peleus, drew the bronze-headed ashen spear from the"
11700,BOOK XX.,"shield of Aeneas, and laid it at the feet of Achilles. Then he"
11701,BOOK XX.,lifted Aeneas on high from off the earth and hurried him away.
11702,BOOK XX.,Over the heads of many a band of warriors both horse and foot did
11703,BOOK XX.,"he soar as the god’s hand sped him, till he came to the very"
11704,BOOK XX.,fringe of the battle where the Cauconians were arming themselves
11705,BOOK XX.,"for fight. Neptune, shaker of the earth, then came near to him"
11706,BOOK XX.,"and said, “Aeneas, what god has egged you on to this folly in"
11707,BOOK XX.,"fighting the son of Peleus, who is both a mightier man of valour"
11708,BOOK XX.,and more beloved of heaven than you are? Give way before him
11709,BOOK XX.,"whensoever you meet him, lest you go down to the house of Hades"
11710,BOOK XX.,even though fate would have it otherwise. When Achilles is dead
11711,BOOK XX.,"you may then fight among the foremost undaunted, for none other"
11712,BOOK XX.,of the Achaeans shall slay you.”
11713,BOOK XX.,
11714,BOOK XX.,"The god left him when he had given him these instructions, and at"
11715,BOOK XX.,"once removed the darkness from before the eyes of Achilles, who"
11716,BOOK XX.,"opened them wide indeed and said in great anger, “Alas! what"
11717,BOOK XX.,"marvel am I now beholding? Here is my spear upon the ground, but"
11718,BOOK XX.,I see not him whom I meant to kill when I hurled it. Of a truth
11719,BOOK XX.,"Aeneas also must be under heaven’s protection, although I had"
11720,BOOK XX.,thought his boasting was idle. Let him go hang; he will be in no
11721,BOOK XX.,"mood to fight me further, seeing how narrowly he has missed being"
11722,BOOK XX.,killed. I will now give my orders to the Danaans and attack some
11723,BOOK XX.,other of the Trojans.”
11724,BOOK XX.,
11725,BOOK XX.,He sprang forward along the line and cheered his men on as he did
11726,BOOK XX.,"so. “Let not the Trojans,” he cried, “keep you at arm’s length,"
11727,BOOK XX.,"Achaeans, but go for them and fight them man for man. However"
11728,BOOK XX.,"valiant I may be, I cannot give chase to so many and fight all of"
11729,BOOK XX.,"them. Even Mars, who is an immortal, or Minerva, would shrink"
11730,BOOK XX.,from flinging himself into the jaws of such a fight and laying
11731,BOOK XX.,"about him; nevertheless, so far as in me lies I will show no"
11732,BOOK XX.,"slackness of hand or foot nor want of endurance, not even for a"
11733,BOOK XX.,"moment; I will utterly break their ranks, and woe to the Trojan"
11734,BOOK XX.,who shall venture within reach of my spear.”
11735,BOOK XX.,
11736,BOOK XX.,Thus did he exhort them. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans
11737,BOOK XX.,"and declared that he would fight Achilles. “Be not afraid, proud"
11738,BOOK XX.,"Trojans,” said he, “to face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods"
11739,BOOK XX.,"myself if the battle were one of words only, but they would be"
11740,BOOK XX.,"more than a match for me, if we had to use our spears. Even so"
11741,BOOK XX.,the deed of Achilles will fall somewhat short of his word; he
11742,BOOK XX.,"will do in part, and the other part he will clip short. I will go"
11743,BOOK XX.,up against him though his hands be as fire—though his hands be
11744,BOOK XX.,fire and his strength iron.”
11745,BOOK XX.,
11746,BOOK XX.,Thus urged the Trojans lifted up their spears against the
11747,BOOK XX.,"Achaeans, and raised the cry of battle as they flung themselves"
11748,BOOK XX.,into the midst of their ranks. But Phoebus Apollo came up to
11749,BOOK XX.,"Hector and said, “Hector, on no account must you challenge"
11750,BOOK XX.,Achilles to single combat; keep a look-out for him while you are
11751,BOOK XX.,"under cover of the others and away from the thick of the fight,"
11752,BOOK XX.,otherwise he will either hit you with a spear or cut you down at
11753,BOOK XX.,close quarters.”
11754,BOOK XX.,
11755,BOOK XX.,"Thus he spoke, and Hector drew back within the crowd, for he was"
11756,BOOK XX.,afraid when he heard what the god had said to him. Achilles then
11757,BOOK XX.,"sprang upon the Trojans with a terrible cry, clothed in valour as"
11758,BOOK XX.,"with a garment. First he killed Iphition son of Otrynteus, a"
11759,BOOK XX.,leader of much people whom a naiad nymph had borne to Otrynteus
11760,BOOK XX.,"waster of cities, in the land of Hyde under the snowy heights of"
11761,BOOK XX.,Mt. Tmolus. Achilles struck him full on the head as he was coming
11762,BOOK XX.,"on towards him, and split it clean in two; whereon he fell"
11763,BOOK XX.,"heavily to the ground and Achilles vaunted over him saying, “You"
11764,BOOK XX.,"be low, son of Otrynteus, mighty hero; your death is here, but"
11765,BOOK XX.,your lineage is on the Gygaean lake where your father’s estate
11766,BOOK XX.,"lies, by Hyllus, rich in fish, and the eddying waters of Hermus.”"
11767,BOOK XX.,
11768,BOOK XX.,"Thus did he vaunt, but darkness closed the eyes of the other. The"
11769,BOOK XX.,chariots of the Achaeans cut him up as their wheels passed over
11770,BOOK XX.,"him in the front of the battle, and after him Achilles killed"
11771,BOOK XX.,"Demoleon, a valiant man of war and son to Antenor. He struck him"
11772,BOOK XX.,on the temple through his bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did
11773,BOOK XX.,"not stay the spear, but it went right on, crushing the bone so"
11774,BOOK XX.,"that the brain inside was shed in all directions, and his lust of"
11775,BOOK XX.,fighting was ended. Then he struck Hippodamas in the midriff as
11776,BOOK XX.,"he was springing down from his chariot in front of him, and"
11777,BOOK XX.,"trying to escape. He breathed his last, bellowing like a bull"
11778,BOOK XX.,bellows when young men are dragging him to offer him in sacrifice
11779,BOOK XX.,"to the King of Helice, and the heart of the earth-shaker is glad;"
11780,BOOK XX.,even so did he bellow as he lay dying. Achilles then went in
11781,BOOK XX.,"pursuit of Polydorus son of Priam, whom his father had always"
11782,BOOK XX.,"forbidden to fight because he was the youngest of his sons, the"
11783,BOOK XX.,"one he loved best, and the fastest runner. He, in his folly and"
11784,BOOK XX.,"showing off the fleetness of his feet, was rushing about among"
11785,BOOK XX.,"front ranks until he lost his life, for Achilles struck him in"
11786,BOOK XX.,the middle of the back as he was darting past him: he struck him
11787,BOOK XX.,just at the golden fastenings of his belt and where the two
11788,BOOK XX.,pieces of the double breastplate overlapped. The point of the
11789,BOOK XX.,"spear pierced him through and came out by the navel, whereon he"
11790,BOOK XX.,fell groaning on to his knees and a cloud of darkness
11791,BOOK XX.,overshadowed him as he sank holding his entrails in his hands.
11792,BOOK XX.,
11793,BOOK XX.,When Hector saw his brother Polydorus with his entrails in his
11794,BOOK XX.,"hands and sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his"
11795,BOOK XX.,"eyes, and he could not bear to keep longer at a distance; he"
11796,BOOK XX.,therefore poised his spear and darted towards Achilles like a
11797,BOOK XX.,flame of fire. When Achilles saw him he bounded forward and
11798,BOOK XX.,"vaunted saying, “This is he that has wounded my heart most deeply"
11799,BOOK XX.,and has slain my beloved comrade. Not for long shall we two quail
11800,BOOK XX.,before one another on the highways of war.”
11801,BOOK XX.,
11802,BOOK XX.,"He looked fiercely on Hector and said, “Draw near, that you may"
11803,BOOK XX.,"meet your doom the sooner.” Hector feared him not and answered,"
11804,BOOK XX.,"“Son of Peleus, think not that your words can scare me as though"
11805,BOOK XX.,I were a child; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I
11806,BOOK XX.,"know that you are a mighty warrior, mightier by far than I,"
11807,BOOK XX.,"nevertheless the issue lies in the lap of heaven whether I, worse"
11808,BOOK XX.,"man though I be, may not slay you with my spear, for this too has"
11809,BOOK XX.,been found keen ere now.”
11810,BOOK XX.,
11811,BOOK XX.,"He hurled his spear as he spoke, but Minerva breathed upon it,"
11812,BOOK XX.,and though she breathed but very lightly she turned it back from
11813,BOOK XX.,"going towards Achilles, so that it returned to Hector and lay at"
11814,BOOK XX.,his feet in front of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him
11815,BOOK XX.,"with a loud cry, bent on killing him, but Apollo caught him up"
11816,BOOK XX.,"easily as a god can, and hid him in a thick darkness. Thrice did"
11817,BOOK XX.,"Achilles spring towards him spear in hand, and thrice did he"
11818,BOOK XX.,waste his blow upon the air. When he rushed forward for the
11819,BOOK XX.,"fourth time as though he were a god, he shouted aloud saying,"
11820,BOOK XX.,"“Hound, this time too you have escaped death—but of a truth it"
11821,BOOK XX.,"came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whom it seems you"
11822,BOOK XX.,"pray before you go into battle, has again saved you; but if I too"
11823,BOOK XX.,have any friend among the gods I will surely make an end of you
11824,BOOK XX.,"when I come across you at some other time. Now, however, I will"
11825,BOOK XX.,pursue and overtake other Trojans.”
11826,BOOK XX.,
11827,BOOK XX.,"On this he struck Dryops with his spear, about the middle of his"
11828,BOOK XX.,"neck, and he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie and"
11829,BOOK XX.,"stayed Demouchus son of Philetor, a man both brave and of great"
11830,BOOK XX.,"stature, by hitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote"
11831,BOOK XX.,him with his sword and killed him. After this he sprang on
11832,BOOK XX.,"Laogonus and Dardanus, sons of Bias, and threw them from their"
11833,BOOK XX.,"chariot, the one with a blow from a thrown spear, while the other"
11834,BOOK XX.,he cut down in hand-to-hand fight. There was also Tros the son of
11835,BOOK XX.,Alastor—he came up to Achilles and clasped his knees in the hope
11836,BOOK XX.,"that he would spare him and not kill him but let him go, because"
11837,BOOK XX.,"they were both of the same age. Fool, he might have known that he"
11838,BOOK XX.,"should not prevail with him, for the man was in no mood for pity"
11839,BOOK XX.,or forbearance but was in grim earnest. Therefore when Tros laid
11840,BOOK XX.,"hold of his knees and sought a hearing for his prayers, Achilles"
11841,BOOK XX.,"drove his sword into his liver, and the liver came rolling out,"
11842,BOOK XX.,while his bosom was all covered with the black blood that welled
11843,BOOK XX.,from the wound. Thus did death close his eyes as he lay lifeless.
11844,BOOK XX.,
11845,BOOK XX.,Achilles then went up to Mulius and struck him on the ear with a
11846,BOOK XX.,"spear, and the bronze spear-head came right out at the other ear."
11847,BOOK XX.,"He also struck Echeclus son of Agenor on the head with his sword,"
11848,BOOK XX.,"which became warm with the blood, while death and stern fate"
11849,BOOK XX.,closed the eyes of Echeclus. Next in order the bronze point of
11850,BOOK XX.,his spear wounded Deucalion in the fore-arm where the sinews of
11851,BOOK XX.,"the elbow are united, whereon he waited Achilles’ onset with his"
11852,BOOK XX.,arm hanging down and death staring him in the face. Achilles cut
11853,BOOK XX.,his head off with a blow from his sword and flung it helmet and
11854,BOOK XX.,"all away from him, and the marrow came oozing out of his backbone"
11855,BOOK XX.,"as he lay. He then went in pursuit of Rhigmus, noble son of"
11856,BOOK XX.,"Peires, who had come from fertile Thrace, and struck him through"
11857,BOOK XX.,"the middle with a spear which fixed itself in his belly, so that"
11858,BOOK XX.,he fell headlong from his chariot. He also speared Areithous
11859,BOOK XX.,squire to Rhigmus in the back as he was turning his horses in
11860,BOOK XX.,"flight, and thrust him from his chariot, while the horses were"
11861,BOOK XX.,struck with panic.
11862,BOOK XX.,
11863,BOOK XX.,As a fire raging in some mountain glen after long drought—and the
11864,BOOK XX.,"dense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great tongues"
11865,BOOK XX.,"of fire in every direction—even so furiously did Achilles rage,"
11866,BOOK XX.,"wielding his spear as though he were a god, and giving chase to"
11867,BOOK XX.,"those whom he would slay, till the dark earth ran with blood. Or"
11868,BOOK XX.,as one who yokes broad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in
11869,BOOK XX.,a threshing-floor—and it is soon bruised small under the feet of
11870,BOOK XX.,the lowing cattle—even so did the horses of Achilles trample on
11871,BOOK XX.,the shields and bodies of the slain. The axle underneath and the
11872,BOOK XX.,railing that ran round the car were bespattered with clots of
11873,BOOK XX.,"blood thrown up by the horses’ hoofs, and from the tyres of the"
11874,BOOK XX.,wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed on to win still further
11875,BOOK XX.,"glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with gore."
11876,BOOK XX.,

11884,BOOK XXI.,among themselves—Achilles drives the Trojans within their gates.
11885,BOOK XXI.,
11886,BOOK XXI.,"Now when they came to the ford of the full-flowing river Xanthus,"
11887,BOOK XXI.,"begotten of immortal Jove, Achilles cut their forces in two: one"
11888,BOOK XXI.,half he chased over the plain towards the city by the same way
11889,BOOK XXI.,that the Achaeans had taken when flying panic-stricken on the
11890,BOOK XXI.,preceding day with Hector in full triumph; this way did they fly
11891,BOOK XXI.,"pell-mell, and Juno sent down a thick mist in front of them to"
11892,BOOK XXI.,stay them. The other half were hemmed in by the deep
11893,BOOK XXI.,"silver-eddying stream, and fell into it with a great uproar. The"
11894,BOOK XXI.,"waters resounded, and the banks rang again, as they swam hither"
11895,BOOK XXI.,and thither with loud cries amid the whirling eddies. As locusts
11896,BOOK XXI.,flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire—the flame
11897,BOOK XXI.,comes on and on till at last it overtakes them and they huddle
11898,BOOK XXI.,into the water—even so was the eddying stream of Xanthus filled
11899,BOOK XXI.,"with the uproar of men and horses, all struggling in confusion"
11900,BOOK XXI.,before Achilles.
11901,BOOK XXI.,
11902,BOOK XXI.,"Forthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank, leaning it"
11903,BOOK XXI.,"against a tamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a god,"
11904,BOOK XXI.,armed with his sword only. Fell was his purpose as he hewed the
11905,BOOK XXI.,Trojans down on every side. Their dying groans rose hideous as
11906,BOOK XXI.,"the sword smote them, and the river ran red with blood. As when"
11907,BOOK XXI.,"fish fly scared before a huge dolphin, and fill every nook and"
11908,BOOK XXI.,corner of some fair haven—for he is sure to eat all he can
11909,BOOK XXI.,catch—even so did the Trojans cower under the banks of the mighty
11910,BOOK XXI.,"river, and when Achilles’ arms grew weary with killing them, he"
11911,BOOK XXI.,"drew twelve youths alive out of the water, to sacrifice in"
11912,BOOK XXI.,revenge for Patroclus son of Menoetius. He drew them out like
11913,BOOK XXI.,"dazed fawns, bound their hands behind them with the girdles of"
11914,BOOK XXI.,"their own shirts, and gave them over to his men to take back to"
11915,BOOK XXI.,"the ships. Then he sprang into the river, thirsting for still"
11916,BOOK XXI.,further blood.
11917,BOOK XXI.,
11918,BOOK XXI.,"There he found Lycaon, son of Priam seed of Dardanus, as he was"
11919,BOOK XXI.,escaping out of the water; he it was whom he had once taken
11920,BOOK XXI.,"prisoner when he was in his father’s vineyard, having set upon"
11921,BOOK XXI.,"him by night, as he was cutting young shoots from a wild fig-tree"
11922,BOOK XXI.,to make the wicker sides of a chariot. Achilles then caught him
11923,BOOK XXI.,"to his sorrow unawares, and sent him by sea to Lemnos, where the"
11924,BOOK XXI.,"son of Jason bought him. But a guest-friend, Eetion of Imbros,"
11925,BOOK XXI.,"freed him with a great sum, and sent him to Arisbe, whence he had"
11926,BOOK XXI.,escaped and returned to his father’s house. He had spent eleven
11927,BOOK XXI.,"days happily with his friends after he had come from Lemnos, but"
11928,BOOK XXI.,on the twelfth heaven again delivered him into the hands of
11929,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles, who was to send him to the house of Hades sorely"
11930,BOOK XXI.,against his will. He was unarmed when Achilles caught sight of
11931,BOOK XXI.,"him, and had neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had he any spear,"
11932,BOOK XXI.,"for he had thrown all his armour from him on to the bank, and was"
11933,BOOK XXI.,"sweating with his struggles to get out of the river, so that his"
11934,BOOK XXI.,strength was now failing him.
11935,BOOK XXI.,
11936,BOOK XXI.,"Then Achilles said to himself in his surprise, “What marvel do I"
11937,BOOK XXI.,see here? If this man can come back alive after having been sold
11938,BOOK XXI.,"over into Lemnos, I shall have the Trojans also whom I have slain"
11939,BOOK XXI.,rising from the world below. Could not even the waters of the
11940,BOOK XXI.,"grey sea imprison him, as they do many another whether he will or"
11941,BOOK XXI.,"no? This time let him taste my spear, that I may know for certain"
11942,BOOK XXI.,"whether mother earth who can keep even a strong man down, will be"
11943,BOOK XXI.,"able to hold him, or whether thence too he will return.”"
11944,BOOK XXI.,
11945,BOOK XXI.,Thus did he pause and ponder. But Lycaon came up to him dazed and
11946,BOOK XXI.,"trying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not"
11947,BOOK XXI.,"die. Achilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him,"
11948,BOOK XXI.,"but Lycaon ran crouching up to him and caught his knees, whereby"
11949,BOOK XXI.,"the spear passed over his back, and stuck in the ground,"
11950,BOOK XXI.,hungering though it was for blood. With one hand he caught
11951,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles’ knees as he besought him, and with the other he"
11952,BOOK XXI.,"clutched the spear and would not let it go. Then he said,"
11953,BOOK XXI.,"“Achilles, have mercy upon me and spare me, for I am your"
11954,BOOK XXI.,suppliant. It was in your tents that I first broke bread on the
11955,BOOK XXI.,day when you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you
11956,BOOK XXI.,"sold me away to Lemnos far from my father and my friends, and I"
11957,BOOK XXI.,brought you the price of a hundred oxen. I have paid three times
11958,BOOK XXI.,as much to gain my freedom; it is but twelve days that I have
11959,BOOK XXI.,"come to Ilius after much suffering, and now cruel fate has again"
11960,BOOK XXI.,"thrown me into your hands. Surely father Jove must hate me, that"
11961,BOOK XXI.,he has given me over to you a second time. Short of life indeed
11962,BOOK XXI.,"did my mother Laothoe bear me, daughter of aged Altes—of Altes"
11963,BOOK XXI.,who reigns over the warlike Lelegae and holds steep Pedasus on
11964,BOOK XXI.,the river Satnioeis. Priam married his daughter along with many
11965,BOOK XXI.,"other women and two sons were born of her, both of whom you will"
11966,BOOK XXI.,have slain. Your spear slew noble Polydorus as he was fighting in
11967,BOOK XXI.,"the front ranks, and now evil will here befall me, for I fear"
11968,BOOK XXI.,that I shall not escape you since heaven has delivered me over to
11969,BOOK XXI.,"you. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, spare"
11970,BOOK XXI.,"me, for I am not of the same womb as Hector who slew your brave"
11971,BOOK XXI.,and noble comrade.”
11972,BOOK XXI.,
11973,BOOK XXI.,With such words did the princely son of Priam beseech Achilles;
11974,BOOK XXI.,"but Achilles answered him sternly. “Idiot,” said he, “talk not to"
11975,BOOK XXI.,me of ransom. Until Patroclus fell I preferred to give the
11976,BOOK XXI.,"Trojans quarter, and sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had"
11977,BOOK XXI.,taken alive; but now not a man shall live of those whom heaven
11978,BOOK XXI.,delivers into my hands before the city of Ilius—and of all
11979,BOOK XXI.,"Trojans it shall fare hardest with the sons of Priam. Therefore,"
11980,BOOK XXI.,"my friend, you too shall die. Why should you whine in this way?"
11981,BOOK XXI.,"Patroclus fell, and he was a better man than you are. I too—see"
11982,BOOK XXI.,"you not how I am great and goodly? I am son to a noble father,"
11983,BOOK XXI.,"and have a goddess for my mother, but the hands of doom and death"
11984,BOOK XXI.,"overshadow me all as surely. The day will come, either at dawn or"
11985,BOOK XXI.,"dark, or at the noontide, when one shall take my life also in"
11986,BOOK XXI.,"battle, either with his spear, or with an arrow sped from his"
11987,BOOK XXI.,bow.”
11988,BOOK XXI.,
11989,BOOK XXI.,"Thus did he speak, and Lycaon’s heart sank within him. He loosed"
11990,BOOK XXI.,"his hold of the spear, and held out both hands before him; but"
11991,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles drew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone"
11992,BOOK XXI.,on his neck; he plunged his two-edged sword into him to the very
11993,BOOK XXI.,"hilt, whereon he lay at full length on the ground, with the dark"
11994,BOOK XXI.,blood welling from him till the earth was soaked. Then Achilles
11995,BOOK XXI.,caught him by the foot and flung him into the river to go down
11996,BOOK XXI.,"stream, vaunting over him the while, and saying, “Lie there among"
11997,BOOK XXI.,"the fishes, who will lick the blood from your wound and gloat"
11998,BOOK XXI.,"over it; your mother shall not lay you on any bier to mourn you,"
11999,BOOK XXI.,but the eddies of Scamander shall bear you into the broad bosom
12000,BOOK XXI.,of the sea. There shall the fishes feed on the fat of Lycaon as
12001,BOOK XXI.,they dart under the dark ripple of the waters—so perish all of
12002,BOOK XXI.,"you till we reach the citadel of strong Ilius—you in flight, and"
12003,BOOK XXI.,I following after to destroy you. The river with its broad silver
12004,BOOK XXI.,"stream shall serve you in no stead, for all the bulls you offered"
12005,BOOK XXI.,him and all the horses that you flung living into his waters.
12006,BOOK XXI.,None the less miserably shall you perish till there is not a man
12007,BOOK XXI.,of you but has paid in full for the death of Patroclus and the
12008,BOOK XXI.,havoc you wrought among the Achaeans whom you have slain while I
12009,BOOK XXI.,held aloof from battle.”
12010,BOOK XXI.,
12011,BOOK XXI.,"So spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and more angry, and"
12012,BOOK XXI.,pondered within himself how he should stay the hand of Achilles
12013,BOOK XXI.,"and save the Trojans from disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus,"
12014,BOOK XXI.,"spear in hand, sprang upon Asteropaeus son of Pelegon to kill"
12015,BOOK XXI.,him. He was son to the broad river Axius and Periboea eldest
12016,BOOK XXI.,daughter of Acessamenus; for the river had lain with her.
12017,BOOK XXI.,Asteropaeus stood up out of the water to face him with a spear in
12018,BOOK XXI.,"either hand, and Xanthus filled him with courage, being angry for"
12019,BOOK XXI.,the death of the youths whom Achilles was slaying ruthlessly
12020,BOOK XXI.,within his waters. When they were close up with one another
12021,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles was first to speak. “Who and whence are you,” said he,"
12022,BOOK XXI.,“who dare to face me? Woe to the parents whose son stands up
12023,BOOK XXI.,"against me.” And the son of Pelegon answered, “Great son of"
12024,BOOK XXI.,"Peleus, why should you ask my lineage. I am from the fertile land"
12025,BOOK XXI.,"of far Paeonia, captain of the Paeonians, and it is now eleven"
12026,BOOK XXI.,days that I am at Ilius. I am of the blood of the river Axius—of
12027,BOOK XXI.,Axius that is the fairest of all rivers that run. He begot the
12028,BOOK XXI.,"famed warrior Pelegon, whose son men call me. Let us now fight,"
12029,BOOK XXI.,Achilles.”
12030,BOOK XXI.,
12031,BOOK XXI.,"Thus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his spear of Pelian"
12032,BOOK XXI.,"ash. Asteropaeus failed with both his spears, for he could use"
12033,BOOK XXI.,"both hands alike; with the one spear he struck Achilles’ shield,"
12034,BOOK XXI.,"but did not pierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god,"
12035,BOOK XXI.,stayed the point; with the other spear he grazed the elbow of
12036,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles’ right arm drawing dark blood, but the spear itself went"
12037,BOOK XXI.,"by him and fixed itself in the ground, foiled of its bloody"
12038,BOOK XXI.,"banquet. Then Achilles, fain to kill him, hurled his spear at"
12039,BOOK XXI.,"Asteropaeus, but failed to hit him and struck the steep bank of"
12040,BOOK XXI.,"the river, driving the spear half its length into the earth. The"
12041,BOOK XXI.,son of Peleus then drew his sword and sprang furiously upon him.
12042,BOOK XXI.,Asteropaeus vainly tried to draw Achilles’ spear out of the bank
12043,BOOK XXI.,"by main force; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his might"
12044,BOOK XXI.,"to draw it out, and thrice he had to leave off trying; the fourth"
12045,BOOK XXI.,"time he tried to bend and break it, but ere he could do so"
12046,BOOK XXI.,Achilles smote him with his sword and killed him. He struck him
12047,BOOK XXI.,"in the belly near the navel, so that all his bowels came gushing"
12048,BOOK XXI.,"out on to the ground, and the darkness of death came over him as"
12049,BOOK XXI.,he lay gasping. Then Achilles set his foot on his chest and
12050,BOOK XXI.,"spoiled him of his armour, vaunting over him and saying, “Lie"
12051,BOOK XXI.,"there—begotten of a river though you be, it is hard for you to"
12052,BOOK XXI.,strive with the offspring of Saturn’s son. You declare yourself
12053,BOOK XXI.,"sprung from the blood of a broad river, but I am of the seed of"
12054,BOOK XXI.,"mighty Jove. My father is Peleus, son of Aeacus ruler over the"
12055,BOOK XXI.,"many Myrmidons, and Aeacus was the son of Jove. Therefore as Jove"
12056,BOOK XXI.,"is mightier than any river that flows into the sea, so are his"
12057,BOOK XXI.,children stronger than those of any river whatsoever. Moreover
12058,BOOK XXI.,"you have a great river hard by if he can be of any use to you,"
12059,BOOK XXI.,"but there is no fighting against Jove the son of Saturn, with"
12060,BOOK XXI.,"whom not even King Achelous can compare, nor the mighty stream of"
12061,BOOK XXI.,"deep-flowing Oceanus, from whom all rivers and seas with all"
12062,BOOK XXI.,springs and deep wells proceed; even Oceanus fears the lightnings
12063,BOOK XXI.,"of great Jove, and his thunder that comes crashing out of"
12064,BOOK XXI.,heaven.”
12065,BOOK XXI.,
12066,BOOK XXI.,"With this he drew his bronze spear out of the bank, and now that"
12067,BOOK XXI.,"he had killed Asteropaeus, he let him lie where he was on the"
12068,BOOK XXI.,"sand, with the dark water flowing over him and the eels and"
12069,BOOK XXI.,fishes busy nibbling and gnawing the fat that was about his
12070,BOOK XXI.,"kidneys. Then he went in chase of the Paeonians, who were flying"
12071,BOOK XXI.,along the bank of the river in panic when they saw their leader
12072,BOOK XXI.,slain by the hands of the son of Peleus. Therein he slew
12073,BOOK XXI.,"Thersilochus, Mydon, Astypylus, Mnesus, Thrasius, Oeneus, and"
12074,BOOK XXI.,"Ophelestes, and he would have slain yet others, had not the river"
12075,BOOK XXI.,"in anger taken human form, and spoken to him from out the deep"
12076,BOOK XXI.,"waters saying, “Achilles, if you excel all in strength, so do you"
12077,BOOK XXI.,"also in wickedness, for the gods are ever with you to protect"
12078,BOOK XXI.,"you: if, then, the son of Saturn has vouchsafed it to you to"
12079,BOOK XXI.,"destroy all the Trojans, at any rate drive them out of my stream,"
12080,BOOK XXI.,and do your grim work on land. My fair waters are now filled with
12081,BOOK XXI.,"corpses, nor can I find any channel by which I may pour myself"
12082,BOOK XXI.,"into the sea for I am choked with dead, and yet you go on"
12083,BOOK XXI.,"mercilessly slaying. I am in despair, therefore, O captain of"
12084,BOOK XXI.,"your host, trouble me no further.”"
12085,BOOK XXI.,
12086,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles answered, “So be it, Scamander, Jove-descended; but I"
12087,BOOK XXI.,"will never cease dealing out death among the Trojans, till I have"
12088,BOOK XXI.,"pent them up in their city, and made trial of Hector face to"
12089,BOOK XXI.,"face, that I may learn whether he is to vanquish me, or I him.”"
12090,BOOK XXI.,
12091,BOOK XXI.,As he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury like that of the
12092,BOOK XXI.,"gods. But the river said to Apollo, “Surely, son of Jove, lord of"
12093,BOOK XXI.,"the silver bow, you are not obeying the commands of Jove who"
12094,BOOK XXI.,charged you straitly that you should stand by the Trojans and
12095,BOOK XXI.,"defend them, till twilight fades, and darkness is over the"
12096,BOOK XXI.,earth.”
12097,BOOK XXI.,
12098,BOOK XXI.,"Meanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into mid-stream, whereon"
12099,BOOK XXI.,the river raised a high wave and attacked him. He swelled his
12100,BOOK XXI.,"stream into a torrent, and swept away the many dead whom Achilles"
12101,BOOK XXI.,had slain and left within his waters. These he cast out on to the
12102,BOOK XXI.,"land, bellowing like a bull the while, but the living he saved"
12103,BOOK XXI.,"alive, hiding them in his mighty eddies. The great and terrible"
12104,BOOK XXI.,"wave gathered about Achilles, falling upon him and beating on his"
12105,BOOK XXI.,"shield, so that he could not keep his feet; he caught hold of a"
12106,BOOK XXI.,"great elm-tree, but it came up by the roots, and tore away the"
12107,BOOK XXI.,"bank, damming the stream with its thick branches and bridging it"
12108,BOOK XXI.,"all across; whereby Achilles struggled out of the stream, and"
12109,BOOK XXI.,"fled full speed over the plain, for he was afraid."
12110,BOOK XXI.,
12111,BOOK XXI.,"But the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit, and sprang upon him"
12112,BOOK XXI.,"with a dark-crested wave, to stay his hands and save the Trojans"
12113,BOOK XXI.,from destruction. The son of Peleus darted away a spear’s throw
12114,BOOK XXI.,from him; swift as the swoop of a black hunter-eagle which is the
12115,BOOK XXI.,"strongest and fleetest of all birds, even so did he spring"
12116,BOOK XXI.,"forward, and the armour rang loudly about his breast. He fled on"
12117,BOOK XXI.,"in front, but the river with a loud roar came tearing after. As"
12118,BOOK XXI.,one who would water his garden leads a stream from some fountain
12119,BOOK XXI.,"over his plants, and all his ground—spade in hand he clears away"
12120,BOOK XXI.,"the dams to free the channels, and the little stones run rolling"
12121,BOOK XXI.,round and round with the water as it goes merrily down the bank
12122,BOOK XXI.,faster than the man can follow—even so did the river keep
12123,BOOK XXI.,"catching up with Achilles albeit he was a fleet runner, for the"
12124,BOOK XXI.,gods are stronger than men. As often as he would strive to stand
12125,BOOK XXI.,"his ground, and see whether or no all the gods in heaven were in"
12126,BOOK XXI.,"league against him, so often would the mighty wave come beating"
12127,BOOK XXI.,"down upon his shoulders, and he would have to keep flying on and"
12128,BOOK XXI.,on in great dismay; for the angry flood was tiring him out as it
12129,BOOK XXI.,flowed past him and ate the ground from under his feet.
12130,BOOK XXI.,
12131,BOOK XXI.,"Then the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to heaven saying,"
12132,BOOK XXI.,"“Father Jove, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon"
12133,BOOK XXI.,"me, and save me from the river? I do not care what may happen to"
12134,BOOK XXI.,me afterwards. I blame none of the other dwellers on Olympus so
12135,BOOK XXI.,"severely as I do my dear mother, who has beguiled and tricked me."
12136,BOOK XXI.,She told me I was to fall under the walls of Troy by the flying
12137,BOOK XXI.,"arrows of Apollo; would that Hector, the best man among the"
12138,BOOK XXI.,"Trojans, might there slay me; then should I fall a hero by the"
12139,BOOK XXI.,hand of a hero; whereas now it seems that I shall come to a most
12140,BOOK XXI.,"pitiable end, trapped in this river as though I were some"
12141,BOOK XXI.,"swineherd’s boy, who gets carried down a torrent while trying to"
12142,BOOK XXI.,cross it during a storm.”
12143,BOOK XXI.,
12144,BOOK XXI.,"As soon as he had spoken thus, Neptune and Minerva came up to him"
12145,BOOK XXI.,"in the likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to reassure"
12146,BOOK XXI.,"him. Neptune spoke first. “Son of Peleus,” said he, “be not so"
12147,BOOK XXI.,"exceeding fearful; we are two gods, come with Jove’s sanction to"
12148,BOOK XXI.,"assist you, I, and Pallas Minerva. It is not your fate to perish"
12149,BOOK XXI.,in this river; he will abate presently as you will see; moreover
12150,BOOK XXI.,"we strongly advise you, if you will be guided by us, not to stay"
12151,BOOK XXI.,your hand from fighting till you have pent the Trojan host within
12152,BOOK XXI.,the famed walls of Ilius—as many of them as may escape. Then kill
12153,BOOK XXI.,"Hector and go back to the ships, for we will vouchsafe you a"
12154,BOOK XXI.,triumph over him.”
12155,BOOK XXI.,
12156,BOOK XXI.,"When they had so said they went back to the other immortals, but"
12157,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles strove onward over the plain, encouraged by the charge"
12158,BOOK XXI.,the gods had laid upon him. All was now covered with the flood of
12159,BOOK XXI.,"waters, and much goodly armour of the youths that had been slain"
12160,BOOK XXI.,"was rifting about, as also many corpses, but he forced his way"
12161,BOOK XXI.,"against the stream, speeding right onwards, nor could the broad"
12162,BOOK XXI.,"waters stay him, for Minerva had endowed him with great strength."
12163,BOOK XXI.,"Nevertheless Scamander did not slacken in his pursuit, but was"
12164,BOOK XXI.,still more furious with the son of Peleus. He lifted his waters
12165,BOOK XXI.,"into a high crest and cried aloud to Simois saying, “Dear"
12166,BOOK XXI.,"brother, let the two of us unite to save this man, or he will"
12167,BOOK XXI.,"sack the mighty city of King Priam, and the Trojans will not hold"
12168,BOOK XXI.,out against him. Help me at once; fill your streams with water
12169,BOOK XXI.,"from their sources, rouse all your torrents to a fury; raise your"
12170,BOOK XXI.,"wave on high, and let snags and stones come thundering down you"
12171,BOOK XXI.,that we may make an end of this savage creature who is now
12172,BOOK XXI.,lording it as though he were a god. Nothing shall serve him
12173,BOOK XXI.,"longer, not strength nor comeliness, nor his fine armour, which"
12174,BOOK XXI.,forsooth shall soon be lying low in the deep waters covered over
12175,BOOK XXI.,"with mud. I will wrap him in sand, and pour tons of shingle round"
12176,BOOK XXI.,"him, so that the Achaeans shall not know how to gather his bones"
12177,BOOK XXI.,"for the silt in which I shall have hidden him, and when they"
12178,BOOK XXI.,celebrate his funeral they need build no barrow.”
12179,BOOK XXI.,
12180,BOOK XXI.,"On this he upraised his tumultuous flood high against Achilles,"
12181,BOOK XXI.,seething as it was with foam and blood and the bodies of the
12182,BOOK XXI.,dead. The dark waters of the river stood upright and would have
12183,BOOK XXI.,"overwhelmed the son of Peleus, but Juno, trembling lest Achilles"
12184,BOOK XXI.,"should be swept away in the mighty torrent, lifted her voice on"
12185,BOOK XXI.,"high and called out to Vulcan her son. “Crook-foot,” she cried,"
12186,BOOK XXI.,"“my child, be up and doing, for I deem it is with you that"
12187,BOOK XXI.,"Xanthus is fain to fight; help us at once, kindle a fierce fire;"
12188,BOOK XXI.,I will then bring up the west and the white south wind in a
12189,BOOK XXI.,"mighty hurricane from the sea, that shall bear the flames against"
12190,BOOK XXI.,"the heads and armour of the Trojans and consume them, while you"
12191,BOOK XXI.,go along the banks of Xanthus burning his trees and wrapping him
12192,BOOK XXI.,round with fire. Let him not turn you back neither by fair words
12193,BOOK XXI.,"nor foul, and slacken not till I shout and tell you. Then you may"
12194,BOOK XXI.,stay your flames.”
12195,BOOK XXI.,
12196,BOOK XXI.,"On this Vulcan kindled a fierce fire, which broke out first upon"
12197,BOOK XXI.,the plain and burned the many dead whom Achilles had killed and
12198,BOOK XXI.,whose bodies were lying about in great numbers; by this means the
12199,BOOK XXI.,"plain was dried and the flood stayed. As the north wind, blowing"
12200,BOOK XXI.,"on an orchard that has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries"
12201,BOOK XXI.,"it, and the heart of the owner is glad—even so the whole plain"
12202,BOOK XXI.,was dried and the dead bodies were consumed. Then he turned
12203,BOOK XXI.,tongues of fire on to the river. He burned the elms the willows
12204,BOOK XXI.,"and the tamarisks, the lotus also, with the rushes and marshy"
12205,BOOK XXI.,herbage that grew abundantly by the banks of the river. The eels
12206,BOOK XXI.,"and fishes that go darting about everywhere in the water, these,"
12207,BOOK XXI.,"too, were sorely harassed by the flames that cunning Vulcan had"
12208,BOOK XXI.,"kindled, and the river himself was scalded, so that he spoke"
12209,BOOK XXI.,"saying, “Vulcan, there is no god can hold his own against you. I"
12210,BOOK XXI.,cannot fight you when you flare out your flames in this way;
12211,BOOK XXI.,strive with me no longer. Let Achilles drive the Trojans out of
12212,BOOK XXI.,their city immediately. What have I to do with quarrelling and
12213,BOOK XXI.,helping people?”
12214,BOOK XXI.,
12215,BOOK XXI.,"He was boiling as he spoke, and all his waters were seething. As"
12216,BOOK XXI.,a cauldron upon a large fire boils when it is melting the lard of
12217,BOOK XXI.,"some fatted hog, and the lard keeps bubbling up all over when the"
12218,BOOK XXI.,dry faggots blaze under it—even so were the goodly waters of
12219,BOOK XXI.,Xanthus heated with the fire till they were boiling. He could
12220,BOOK XXI.,"flow no longer but stayed his stream, so afflicted was he by the"
12221,BOOK XXI.,blasts of fire which cunning Vulcan had raised. Then he prayed to
12222,BOOK XXI.,"Juno and besought her saying, “Juno, why should your son vex my"
12223,BOOK XXI.,stream with such especial fury? I am not so much to blame as all
12224,BOOK XXI.,the others are who have been helping the Trojans. I will leave
12225,BOOK XXI.,"off, since you so desire it, and let your son leave off also."
12226,BOOK XXI.,Furthermore I swear never again will I do anything to save the
12227,BOOK XXI.,"Trojans from destruction, not even when all Troy is burning in"
12228,BOOK XXI.,the flames which the Achaeans will kindle.”
12229,BOOK XXI.,
12230,BOOK XXI.,"As soon as Juno heard this she said to her son Vulcan, “Son"
12231,BOOK XXI.,"Vulcan, hold now your flames; we ought not to use such violence"
12232,BOOK XXI.,against a god for the sake of mortals.”
12233,BOOK XXI.,
12234,BOOK XXI.,"When she had thus spoken Vulcan quenched his flames, and the"
12235,BOOK XXI.,river went back once more into his own fair bed.
12236,BOOK XXI.,
12237,BOOK XXI.,"Xanthus was now beaten, so these two left off fighting, for Juno"
12238,BOOK XXI.,stayed them though she was still angry; but a furious quarrel
12239,BOOK XXI.,"broke out among the other gods, for they were of divided"
12240,BOOK XXI.,counsels. They fell on one another with a mighty uproar—earth
12241,BOOK XXI.,"groaned, and the spacious firmament rang out as with a blare of"
12242,BOOK XXI.,"trumpets. Jove heard as he was sitting on Olympus, and laughed"
12243,BOOK XXI.,for joy when he saw the gods coming to blows among themselves.
12244,BOOK XXI.,"They were not long about beginning, and Mars piercer of shields"
12245,BOOK XXI.,opened the battle. Sword in hand he sprang at once upon Minerva
12246,BOOK XXI.,"and reviled her. “Why, vixen,” said he, “have you again set the"
12247,BOOK XXI.,gods by the ears in the pride and haughtiness of your heart? Have
12248,BOOK XXI.,"you forgotten how you set Diomed son of Tydeus on to wound me,"
12249,BOOK XXI.,and yourself took visible spear and drove it into me to the hurt
12250,BOOK XXI.,of my fair body? You shall now suffer for what you then did to
12251,BOOK XXI.,me.”
12252,BOOK XXI.,
12253,BOOK XXI.,As he spoke he struck her on the terrible tasselled aegis—so
12254,BOOK XXI.,terrible that not even can Jove’s lightning pierce it. Here did
12255,BOOK XXI.,murderous Mars strike her with his great spear. She drew back and
12256,BOOK XXI.,with her strong hand seized a stone that was lying on the
12257,BOOK XXI.,plain—great and rugged and black—which men of old had set for the
12258,BOOK XXI.,"boundary of a field. With this she struck Mars on the neck, and"
12259,BOOK XXI.,"brought him down. Nine roods did he cover in his fall, and his"
12260,BOOK XXI.,"hair was all soiled in the dust, while his armour rang rattling"
12261,BOOK XXI.,"round him. But Minerva laughed and vaunted over him saying,"
12262,BOOK XXI.,"“Idiot, have you not learned how far stronger I am than you, but"
12263,BOOK XXI.,you must still match yourself against me? Thus do your mother’s
12264,BOOK XXI.,"curses now roost upon you, for she is angry and would do you"
12265,BOOK XXI.,mischief because you have deserted the Achaeans and are helping
12266,BOOK XXI.,the Trojans.”
12267,BOOK XXI.,
12268,BOOK XXI.,"She then turned her two piercing eyes elsewhere, whereon Jove’s"
12269,BOOK XXI.,daughter Venus took Mars by the hand and led him away groaning
12270,BOOK XXI.,"all the time, for it was only with great difficulty that he had"
12271,BOOK XXI.,"come to himself again. When Queen Juno saw her, she said to"
12272,BOOK XXI.,"Minerva, “Look, daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, that"
12273,BOOK XXI.,vixen Venus is again taking Mars through the crowd out of the
12274,BOOK XXI.,battle; go after her at once.”
12275,BOOK XXI.,
12276,BOOK XXI.,"Thus she spoke. Minerva sped after Venus with a will, and made at"
12277,BOOK XXI.,"her, striking her on the bosom with her strong hand so that she"
12278,BOOK XXI.,"fell fainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at"
12279,BOOK XXI.,"full length. Then Minerva vaunted over her saying, “May all who"
12280,BOOK XXI.,help the Trojans against the Argives prove just as redoubtable
12281,BOOK XXI.,and stalwart as Venus did when she came across me while she was
12282,BOOK XXI.,"helping Mars. Had this been so, we should long since have ended"
12283,BOOK XXI.,the war by sacking the strong city of Ilius.”
12284,BOOK XXI.,
12285,BOOK XXI.,Juno smiled as she listened. Meanwhile King Neptune turned to
12286,BOOK XXI.,"Apollo saying, “Phoebus, why should we keep each other at arm’s"
12287,BOOK XXI.,"length? it is not well, now that the others have begun fighting;"
12288,BOOK XXI.,it will be disgraceful to us if we return to Jove’s
12289,BOOK XXI.,bronze-floored mansion on Olympus without having fought each
12290,BOOK XXI.,"other; therefore come on, you are the younger of the two, and I"
12291,BOOK XXI.,"ought not to attack you, for I am older and have had more"
12292,BOOK XXI.,"experience. Idiot, you have no sense, and forget how we two alone"
12293,BOOK XXI.,of all the gods fared hardly round about Ilius when we came from
12294,BOOK XXI.,Jove’s house and worked for Laomedon a whole year at a stated
12295,BOOK XXI.,wage and he gave us his orders. I built the Trojans the wall
12296,BOOK XXI.,"about their city, so wide and fair that it might be impregnable,"
12297,BOOK XXI.,"while you, Phoebus, herded cattle for him in the dales of many"
12298,BOOK XXI.,"valleyed Ida. When, however, the glad hours brought round the"
12299,BOOK XXI.,"time of payment, mighty Laomedon robbed us of all our hire and"
12300,BOOK XXI.,sent us off with nothing but abuse. He threatened to bind us hand
12301,BOOK XXI.,"and foot and sell us over into some distant island. He tried,"
12302,BOOK XXI.,"moreover, to cut off the ears of both of us, so we went away in a"
12303,BOOK XXI.,"rage, furious about the payment he had promised us, and yet"
12304,BOOK XXI.,"withheld; in spite of all this, you are now showing favour to his"
12305,BOOK XXI.,"people, and will not join us in compassing the utter ruin of the"
12306,BOOK XXI.,proud Trojans with their wives and children.”
12307,BOOK XXI.,
12308,BOOK XXI.,"And King Apollo answered, “Lord of the earthquake, you would have"
12309,BOOK XXI.,no respect for me if I were to fight you about a pack of
12310,BOOK XXI.,"miserable mortals, who come out like leaves in summer and eat the"
12311,BOOK XXI.,"fruit of the field, and presently fall lifeless to the ground."
12312,BOOK XXI.,Let us stay this fighting at once and let them settle it among
12313,BOOK XXI.,themselves.”
12314,BOOK XXI.,
12315,BOOK XXI.,"He turned away as he spoke, for he would lay no hand on the"
12316,BOOK XXI.,"brother of his own father. But his sister the huntress Diana,"
12317,BOOK XXI.,"patroness of wild beasts, was very angry with him and said, “So"
12318,BOOK XXI.,"you would fly, Far-Darter, and hand victory over to Neptune with"
12319,BOOK XXI.,"a cheap vaunt to boot. Baby, why keep your bow thus idle? Never"
12320,BOOK XXI.,"let me again hear you bragging in my father’s house, as you have"
12321,BOOK XXI.,"often done in the presence of the immortals, that you would stand"
12322,BOOK XXI.,up and fight with Neptune.”
12323,BOOK XXI.,
12324,BOOK XXI.,"Apollo made her no answer, but Jove’s august queen was angry and"
12325,BOOK XXI.,"upbraided her bitterly. “Bold vixen,” she cried, “how dare you"
12326,BOOK XXI.,cross me thus? For all your bow you will find it hard to hold
12327,BOOK XXI.,"your own against me. Jove made you as a lion among women, and"
12328,BOOK XXI.,lets you kill them whenever you choose. You will find it better
12329,BOOK XXI.,to chase wild beasts and deer upon the mountains than to fight
12330,BOOK XXI.,"those who are stronger than you are. If you would try war, do so,"
12331,BOOK XXI.,"and find out by pitting yourself against me, how far stronger I"
12332,BOOK XXI.,am than you are.”
12333,BOOK XXI.,
12334,BOOK XXI.,"She caught both Diana’s wrists with her left hand as she spoke,"
12335,BOOK XXI.,"and with her right she took the bow from her shoulders, and"
12336,BOOK XXI.,laughed as she beat her with it about the ears while Diana
12337,BOOK XXI.,wriggled and writhed under her blows. Her swift arrows were shed
12338,BOOK XXI.,"upon the ground, and she fled weeping from under Juno’s hand as a"
12339,BOOK XXI.,"dove that flies before a falcon to the cleft of some hollow rock,"
12340,BOOK XXI.,when it is her good fortune to escape. Even so did she fly
12341,BOOK XXI.,"weeping away, leaving her bow and arrows behind her."
12342,BOOK XXI.,
12343,BOOK XXI.,"Then the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, said to Leto,"
12344,BOOK XXI.,"“Leto, I shall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any"
12345,BOOK XXI.,of Jove’s wives. Therefore boast as you will among the immortals
12346,BOOK XXI.,that you worsted me in fair fight.”
12347,BOOK XXI.,
12348,BOOK XXI.,Leto then gathered up Diana’s bow and arrows that had fallen
12349,BOOK XXI.,"about amid the whirling dust, and when she had got them she made"
12350,BOOK XXI.,all haste after her daughter. Diana had now reached Jove’s
12351,BOOK XXI.,"bronze-floored mansion on Olympus, and sat herself down with many"
12352,BOOK XXI.,"tears on the knees of her father, while her ambrosial raiment was"
12353,BOOK XXI.,"quivering all about her. The son of Saturn drew her towards him,"
12354,BOOK XXI.,"and laughing pleasantly the while began to question her saying,"
12355,BOOK XXI.,"“Which of the heavenly beings, my dear child, has been treating"
12356,BOOK XXI.,"you in this cruel manner, as though you had been misconducting"
12357,BOOK XXI.,yourself in the face of everybody?” and the fair-crowned goddess
12358,BOOK XXI.,"of the chase answered, “It was your wife Juno, father, who has"
12359,BOOK XXI.,been beating me; it is always her doing when there is any
12360,BOOK XXI.,quarrelling among the immortals.”
12361,BOOK XXI.,
12362,BOOK XXI.,"Thus did they converse, and meanwhile Phoebus Apollo entered the"
12363,BOOK XXI.,"strong city of Ilius, for he was uneasy lest the wall should not"
12364,BOOK XXI.,"hold out and the Danaans should take the city then and there,"
12365,BOOK XXI.,before its hour had come; but the rest of the ever-living gods
12366,BOOK XXI.,"went back, some angry and some triumphant to Olympus, where they"
12367,BOOK XXI.,"took their seats beside Jove lord of the storm-cloud, while"
12368,BOOK XXI.,Achilles still kept on dealing out death alike on the Trojans and
12369,BOOK XXI.,on their horses. As when the smoke from some burning city ascends
12370,BOOK XXI.,to heaven when the anger of the gods has kindled it—there is then
12371,BOOK XXI.,"toil for all, and sorrow for not a few—even so did Achilles bring"
12372,BOOK XXI.,toil and sorrow on the Trojans.
12373,BOOK XXI.,
12374,BOOK XXI.,Old King Priam stood on a high tower of the wall looking down on
12375,BOOK XXI.,"huge Achilles as the Trojans fled panic-stricken before him, and"
12376,BOOK XXI.,there was none to help them. Presently he came down from off the
12377,BOOK XXI.,tower and with many a groan went along the wall to give orders to
12378,BOOK XXI.,"the brave warders of the gate. “Keep the gates,” said he, “wide"
12379,BOOK XXI.,"open till the people come flying into the city, for Achilles is"
12380,BOOK XXI.,hard by and is driving them in rout before him. I see we are in
12381,BOOK XXI.,"great peril. As soon as our people are inside and in safety,"
12382,BOOK XXI.,close the strong gates for I fear lest that terrible man should
12383,BOOK XXI.,come bounding inside along with the others.”
12384,BOOK XXI.,
12385,BOOK XXI.,"As he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened the gates, and"
12386,BOOK XXI.,when these were opened there was a haven of refuge for the
12387,BOOK XXI.,Trojans. Apollo then came full speed out of the city to meet them
12388,BOOK XXI.,"and protect them. Right for the city and the high wall, parched"
12389,BOOK XXI.,"with thirst and grimy with dust, still they fled on, with"
12390,BOOK XXI.,Achilles wielding his spear furiously behind them. For he was as
12391,BOOK XXI.,"one possessed, and was thirsting after glory."
12392,BOOK XXI.,
12393,BOOK XXI.,Then had the sons of the Achaeans taken the lofty gates of Troy
12394,BOOK XXI.,"if Apollo had not spurred on Agenor, valiant and noble son to"
12395,BOOK XXI.,"Antenor. He put courage into his heart, and stood by his side to"
12396,BOOK XXI.,"guard him, leaning against a beech tree and shrouded in thick"
12397,BOOK XXI.,darkness. When Agenor saw Achilles he stood still and his heart
12398,BOOK XXI.,"was clouded with care. “Alas,” said he to himself in his dismay,"
12399,BOOK XXI.,"“if I fly before mighty Achilles, and go where all the others are"
12400,BOOK XXI.,"being driven in rout, he will none the less catch me and kill me"
12401,BOOK XXI.,for a coward. How would it be were I to let Achilles drive the
12402,BOOK XXI.,"others before him, and then fly from the wall to the plain that"
12403,BOOK XXI.,is behind Ilius till I reach the spurs of Ida and can hide in the
12404,BOOK XXI.,underwood that is thereon? I could then wash the sweat from off
12405,BOOK XXI.,me in the river and in the evening return to Ilius. But why
12406,BOOK XXI.,commune with myself in this way? Like enough he would see me as I
12407,BOOK XXI.,"am hurrying from the city over the plain, and would speed after"
12408,BOOK XXI.,"me till he had caught me—I should stand no chance against him,"
12409,BOOK XXI.,"for he is mightiest of all mankind. What, then, if I go out and"
12410,BOOK XXI.,"meet him in front of the city? His flesh too, I take it, can be"
12411,BOOK XXI.,"pierced by pointed bronze. Life is the same in one and all, and"
12412,BOOK XXI.,men say that he is but mortal despite the triumph that Jove son
12413,BOOK XXI.,of Saturn vouchsafes him.”
12414,BOOK XXI.,
12415,BOOK XXI.,"So saying he stood on his guard and awaited Achilles, for he was"
12416,BOOK XXI.,now fain to fight him. As a leopardess that bounds from out a
12417,BOOK XXI.,thick covert to attack a hunter—she knows no fear and is not
12418,BOOK XXI.,dismayed by the baying of the hounds; even though the man be too
12419,BOOK XXI.,"quick for her and wound her either with thrust or spear, still,"
12420,BOOK XXI.,though the spear has pierced her she will not give in till she
12421,BOOK XXI.,has either caught him in her grip or been killed outright—even so
12422,BOOK XXI.,did noble Agenor son of Antenor refuse to fly till he had made
12423,BOOK XXI.,"trial of Achilles, and took aim at him with his spear, holding"
12424,BOOK XXI.,his round shield before him and crying with a loud voice. “Of a
12425,BOOK XXI.,"truth,” said he, “noble Achilles, you deem that you shall this"
12426,BOOK XXI.,"day sack the city of the proud Trojans. Fool, there will be"
12427,BOOK XXI.,"trouble enough yet before it, for there is many a brave man of us"
12428,BOOK XXI.,still inside who will stand in front of our dear parents with our
12429,BOOK XXI.,"wives and children, to defend Ilius. Here therefore, huge and"
12430,BOOK XXI.,"mighty warrior though you be, here shall you die.”"
12431,BOOK XXI.,
12432,BOOK XXI.,"As he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin from him, and the"
12433,BOOK XXI.,spear struck Achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave of
12434,BOOK XXI.,"newly wrought tin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the"
12435,BOOK XXI.,"body of him whom it had struck, and did not pierce it, for the"
12436,BOOK XXI.,"god’s gift stayed it. Achilles in his turn attacked noble Agenor,"
12437,BOOK XXI.,"but Apollo would not vouchsafe him glory, for he snatched Agenor"
12438,BOOK XXI.,"away and hid him in a thick mist, sending him out of the battle"
12439,BOOK XXI.,unmolested. Then he craftily drew the son of Peleus away from
12440,BOOK XXI.,"going after the host, for he put on the semblance of Agenor and"
12441,BOOK XXI.,"stood in front of Achilles, who ran towards him to give him chase"
12442,BOOK XXI.,"and pursued him over the corn lands of the plain, turning him"
12443,BOOK XXI.,towards the deep waters of the river Scamander. Apollo ran but a
12444,BOOK XXI.,little way before him and beguiled Achilles by making him think
12445,BOOK XXI.,all the time that he was on the point of overtaking him.
12446,BOOK XXI.,Meanwhile the rabble of routed Trojans was thankful to crowd
12447,BOOK XXI.,within the city till their numbers thronged it; no longer did
12448,BOOK XXI.,"they dare wait for one another outside the city walls, to learn"
12449,BOOK XXI.,"who had escaped and who were fallen in fight, but all whose feet"
12450,BOOK XXI.,and knees could still carry them poured pell-mell into the town.
12451,BOOK XXI.,

12453,BOOK XXI.,
12454,BOOK XXI.,
12455,BOOK XXII.,BOOK XXII.
12456,BOOK XXII.,
12457,BOOK XXII.,
12458,BOOK XXII.,The death of Hector.
12459,BOOK XXII.,
12460,BOOK XXII.,"Thus the Trojans in the city, scared like fawns, wiped the sweat"
12461,BOOK XXII.,"from off them and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against"
12462,BOOK XXII.,"the goodly battlements, while the Achaeans with their shields"
12463,BOOK XXII.,laid upon their shoulders drew close up to the walls. But stern
12464,BOOK XXII.,fate bade Hector stay where he was before Ilius and the Scaean
12465,BOOK XXII.,"gates. Then Phoebus Apollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying,"
12466,BOOK XXII.,"“Why, son of Peleus, do you, who are but man, give chase to me"
12467,BOOK XXII.,who am immortal? Have you not yet found out that it is a god whom
12468,BOOK XXII.,you pursue so furiously? You did not harass the Trojans whom you
12469,BOOK XXII.,"had routed, and now they are within their walls, while you have"
12470,BOOK XXII.,"been decoyed hither away from them. Me you cannot kill, for death"
12471,BOOK XXII.,can take no hold upon me.”
12472,BOOK XXII.,
12473,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles was greatly angered and said, “You have baulked me,"
12474,BOOK XXII.,"Far-Darter, most malicious of all gods, and have drawn me away"
12475,BOOK XXII.,"from the wall, where many another man would have bitten the dust"
12476,BOOK XXII.,ere he got within Ilius; you have robbed me of great glory and
12477,BOOK XXII.,"have saved the Trojans at no risk to yourself, for you have"
12478,BOOK XXII.,"nothing to fear, but I would indeed have my revenge if it were in"
12479,BOOK XXII.,my power to do so.”
12480,BOOK XXII.,
12481,BOOK XXII.,"On this, with fell intent he made towards the city, and as the"
12482,BOOK XXII.,winning horse in a chariot race strains every nerve when he is
12483,BOOK XXII.,"flying over the plain, even so fast and furiously did the limbs"
12484,BOOK XXII.,of Achilles bear him onwards. King Priam was first to note him as
12485,BOOK XXII.,"he scoured the plain, all radiant as the star which men call"
12486,BOOK XXII.,"Orion’s Hound, and whose beams blaze forth in time of harvest"
12487,BOOK XXII.,more brilliantly than those of any other that shines by night;
12488,BOOK XXII.,"brightest of them all though he be, he yet bodes ill for mortals,"
12489,BOOK XXII.,for he brings fire and fever in his train—even so did Achilles’
12490,BOOK XXII.,armour gleam on his breast as he sped onwards. Priam raised a cry
12491,BOOK XXII.,and beat his head with his hands as he lifted them up and shouted
12492,BOOK XXII.,"out to his dear son, imploring him to return; but Hector still"
12493,BOOK XXII.,"stayed before the gates, for his heart was set upon doing battle"
12494,BOOK XXII.,with Achilles. The old man reached out his arms towards him and
12495,BOOK XXII.,"bade him for pity’s sake come within the walls. “Hector,” he"
12496,BOOK XXII.,"cried, “my son, stay not to face this man alone and unsupported,"
12497,BOOK XXII.,"or you will meet death at the hands of the son of Peleus, for he"
12498,BOOK XXII.,is mightier than you. Monster that he is; would indeed that the
12499,BOOK XXII.,"gods loved him no better than I do, for so, dogs and vultures"
12500,BOOK XXII.,"would soon devour him as he lay stretched on earth, and a load of"
12501,BOOK XXII.,"grief would be lifted from my heart, for many a brave son has he"
12502,BOOK XXII.,"reft from me, either by killing them or selling them away in the"
12503,BOOK XXII.,islands that are beyond the sea: even now I miss two sons from
12504,BOOK XXII.,"among the Trojans who have thronged within the city, Lycaon and"
12505,BOOK XXII.,"Polydorus, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they"
12506,BOOK XXII.,"be still alive and in the hands of the Achaeans, we will ransom"
12507,BOOK XXII.,"them with gold and bronze, of which we have store, for the old"
12508,BOOK XXII.,man Altes endowed his daughter richly; but if they are already
12509,BOOK XXII.,"dead and in the house of Hades, sorrow will it be to us two who"
12510,BOOK XXII.,were their parents; albeit the grief of others will be more
12511,BOOK XXII.,"short-lived unless you too perish at the hands of Achilles. Come,"
12512,BOOK XXII.,"then, my son, within the city, to be the guardian of Trojan men"
12513,BOOK XXII.,"and Trojan women, or you will both lose your own life and afford"
12514,BOOK XXII.,a mighty triumph to the son of Peleus. Have pity also on your
12515,BOOK XXII.,"unhappy father while life yet remains to him—on me, whom the son"
12516,BOOK XXII.,of Saturn will destroy by a terrible doom on the threshold of old
12517,BOOK XXII.,"age, after I have seen my sons slain and my daughters haled away"
12518,BOOK XXII.,"as captives, my bridal chambers pillaged, little children dashed"
12519,BOOK XXII.,"to earth amid the rage of battle, and my sons’ wives dragged away"
12520,BOOK XXII.,by the cruel hands of the Achaeans; in the end fierce hounds will
12521,BOOK XXII.,tear me in pieces at my own gates after some one has beaten the
12522,BOOK XXII.,life out of my body with sword or spear-hounds that I myself
12523,BOOK XXII.,"reared and fed at my own table to guard my gates, but who will"
12524,BOOK XXII.,yet lap my blood and then lie all distraught at my doors. When a
12525,BOOK XXII.,"young man falls by the sword in battle, he may lie where he is"
12526,BOOK XXII.,"and there is nothing unseemly; let what will be seen, all is"
12527,BOOK XXII.,"honourable in death, but when an old man is slain there is"
12528,BOOK XXII.,nothing in this world more pitiable than that dogs should defile
12529,BOOK XXII.,his grey hair and beard and all that men hide for shame.”
12530,BOOK XXII.,
12531,BOOK XXII.,"The old man tore his grey hair as he spoke, but he moved not the"
12532,BOOK XXII.,heart of Hector. His mother hard by wept and moaned aloud as she
12533,BOOK XXII.,bared her bosom and pointed to the breast which had suckled him.
12534,BOOK XXII.,"“Hector,” she cried, weeping bitterly the while, “Hector, my son,"
12535,BOOK XXII.,"spurn not this breast, but have pity upon me too: if I have ever"
12536,BOOK XXII.,"given you comfort from my own bosom, think on it now, dear son,"
12537,BOOK XXII.,and come within the wall to protect us from this man; stand not
12538,BOOK XXII.,"without to meet him. Should the wretch kill you, neither I nor"
12539,BOOK XXII.,"your richly dowered wife shall ever weep, dear offshoot of"
12540,BOOK XXII.,"myself, over the bed on which you lie, for dogs will devour you"
12541,BOOK XXII.,at the ships of the Achaeans.”
12542,BOOK XXII.,
12543,BOOK XXII.,"Thus did the two with many tears implore their son, but they"
12544,BOOK XXII.,"moved not the heart of Hector, and he stood his ground awaiting"
12545,BOOK XXII.,huge Achilles as he drew nearer towards him. As a serpent in its
12546,BOOK XXII.,"den upon the mountains, full fed with deadly poisons, waits for"
12547,BOOK XXII.,the approach of man—he is filled with fury and his eyes glare
12548,BOOK XXII.,terribly as he goes writhing round his den—even so Hector leaned
12549,BOOK XXII.,his shield against a tower that jutted out from the wall and
12550,BOOK XXII.,"stood where he was, undaunted."
12551,BOOK XXII.,
12552,BOOK XXII.,"“Alas,” said he to himself in the heaviness of his heart, “if I"
12553,BOOK XXII.,"go within the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap reproach"
12554,BOOK XXII.,"upon me, for it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to"
12555,BOOK XXII.,the city on that awful night when Achilles again came forth
12556,BOOK XXII.,"against us. I would not listen, but it would have been indeed"
12557,BOOK XXII.,better if I had done so. Now that my folly has destroyed the
12558,BOOK XXII.,"host, I dare not look Trojan men and Trojan women in the face,"
12559,BOOK XXII.,"lest a worse man should say, ‘Hector has ruined us by his"
12560,BOOK XXII.,self-confidence.’ Surely it would be better for me to return
12561,BOOK XXII.,"after having fought Achilles and slain him, or to die gloriously"
12562,BOOK XXII.,"here before the city. What, again, if I were to lay down my"
12563,BOOK XXII.,"shield and helmet, lean my spear against the wall and go straight"
12564,BOOK XXII.,"up to noble Achilles? What if I were to promise to give up Helen,"
12565,BOOK XXII.,"who was the fountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure"
12566,BOOK XXII.,"that Alexandrus brought with him in his ships to Troy, aye, and"
12567,BOOK XXII.,to let the Achaeans divide the half of everything that the city
12568,BOOK XXII.,"contains among themselves? I might make the Trojans, by the"
12569,BOOK XXII.,"mouths of their princes, take a solemn oath that they would hide"
12570,BOOK XXII.,"nothing, but would divide into two shares all that is within the"
12571,BOOK XXII.,city—but why argue with myself in this way? Were I to go up to
12572,BOOK XXII.,him he would show me no kind of mercy; he would kill me then and
12573,BOOK XXII.,"there as easily as though I were a woman, when I had off my"
12574,BOOK XXII.,armour. There is no parleying with him from some rock or oak tree
12575,BOOK XXII.,as young men and maidens prattle with one another. Better fight
12576,BOOK XXII.,"him at once, and learn to which of us Jove will vouchsafe"
12577,BOOK XXII.,victory.”
12578,BOOK XXII.,
12579,BOOK XXII.,"Thus did he stand and ponder, but Achilles came up to him as it"
12580,BOOK XXII.,"were Mars himself, plumed lord of battle. From his right shoulder"
12581,BOOK XXII.,"he brandished his terrible spear of Pelian ash, and the bronze"
12582,BOOK XXII.,gleamed around him like flashing fire or the rays of the rising
12583,BOOK XXII.,"sun. Fear fell upon Hector as he beheld him, and he dared not"
12584,BOOK XXII.,stay longer where he was but fled in dismay from before the
12585,BOOK XXII.,"gates, while Achilles darted after him at his utmost speed. As a"
12586,BOOK XXII.,"mountain falcon, swiftest of all birds, swoops down upon some"
12587,BOOK XXII.,cowering dove—the dove flies before him but the falcon with a
12588,BOOK XXII.,"shrill scream follows close after, resolved to have her—even so"
12589,BOOK XXII.,"did Achilles make straight for Hector with all his might, while"
12590,BOOK XXII.,Hector fled under the Trojan wall as fast as his limbs could take
12591,BOOK XXII.,him.
12592,BOOK XXII.,
12593,BOOK XXII.,On they flew along the waggon-road that ran hard by under the
12594,BOOK XXII.,"wall, past the look-out station, and past the weather-beaten wild"
12595,BOOK XXII.,"fig-tree, till they came to two fair springs which feed the river"
12596,BOOK XXII.,"Scamander. One of these two springs is warm, and steam rises from"
12597,BOOK XXII.,"it as smoke from a burning fire, but the other even in summer is"
12598,BOOK XXII.,"as cold as hail or snow, or the ice that forms on water. Here,"
12599,BOOK XXII.,"hard by the springs, are the goodly washing-troughs of stone,"
12600,BOOK XXII.,where in the time of peace before the coming of the Achaeans the
12601,BOOK XXII.,wives and fair daughters of the Trojans used to wash their
12602,BOOK XXII.,"clothes. Past these did they fly, the one in front and the other"
12603,BOOK XXII.,"giving chase behind him: good was the man that fled, but better"
12604,BOOK XXII.,"far was he that followed after, and swiftly indeed did they run,"
12605,BOOK XXII.,"for the prize was no mere beast for sacrifice or bullock’s hide,"
12606,BOOK XXII.,"as it might be for a common foot-race, but they ran for the life"
12607,BOOK XXII.,of Hector. As horses in a chariot race speed round the
12608,BOOK XXII.,turning-posts when they are running for some great prize—a tripod
12609,BOOK XXII.,"or woman—at the games in honour of some dead hero, so did these"
12610,BOOK XXII.,two run full speed three times round the city of Priam. All the
12611,BOOK XXII.,"gods watched them, and the sire of gods and men was the first to"
12612,BOOK XXII.,speak.
12613,BOOK XXII.,
12614,BOOK XXII.,"“Alas,” said he, “my eyes behold a man who is dear to me being"
12615,BOOK XXII.,pursued round the walls of Troy; my heart is full of pity for
12616,BOOK XXII.,"Hector, who has burned the thigh-bones of many a heifer in my"
12617,BOOK XXII.,"honour, one while on the crests of many-valleyed Ida, and again"
12618,BOOK XXII.,on the citadel of Troy; and now I see noble Achilles in full
12619,BOOK XXII.,pursuit of him round the city of Priam. What say you? Consider
12620,BOOK XXII.,among yourselves and decide whether we shall now save him or let
12621,BOOK XXII.,"him fall, valiant though he be, before Achilles, son of Peleus.”"
12622,BOOK XXII.,
12623,BOOK XXII.,"Then Minerva said, “Father, wielder of the lightning, lord of"
12624,BOOK XXII.,"cloud and storm, what mean you? Would you pluck this mortal whose"
12625,BOOK XXII.,doom has long been decreed out of the jaws of death? Do as you
12626,BOOK XXII.,"will, but we others shall not be of a mind with you.”"
12627,BOOK XXII.,
12628,BOOK XXII.,"And Jove answered, “My child, Trito-born, take heart. I did not"
12629,BOOK XXII.,"speak in full earnest, and I will let you have your way. Do"
12630,BOOK XXII.,without let or hindrance as you are minded.”
12631,BOOK XXII.,
12632,BOOK XXII.,"Thus did he urge Minerva who was already eager, and down she"
12633,BOOK XXII.,darted from the topmost summits of Olympus.
12634,BOOK XXII.,
12635,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles was still in full pursuit of Hector, as a hound chasing"
12636,BOOK XXII.,"a fawn which he has started from its covert on the mountains, and"
12637,BOOK XXII.,hunts through glade and thicket. The fawn may try to elude him by
12638,BOOK XXII.,"crouching under cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and"
12639,BOOK XXII.,follow her up until he gets her—even so there was no escape for
12640,BOOK XXII.,Hector from the fleet son of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to
12641,BOOK XXII.,"get near the Dardanian gates and under the walls, that his people"
12642,BOOK XXII.,"might help him by showering down weapons from above, Achilles"
12643,BOOK XXII.,"would gain on him and head him back towards the plain, keeping"
12644,BOOK XXII.,himself always on the city side. As a man in a dream who fails to
12645,BOOK XXII.,lay hands upon another whom he is pursuing—the one cannot escape
12646,BOOK XXII.,nor the other overtake—even so neither could Achilles come up
12647,BOOK XXII.,"with Hector, nor Hector break away from Achilles; nevertheless he"
12648,BOOK XXII.,might even yet have escaped death had not the time come when
12649,BOOK XXII.,"Apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and nerved his"
12650,BOOK XXII.,"running, was now no longer to stay by him. Achilles made signs to"
12651,BOOK XXII.,"the Achaean host, and shook his head to show that no man was to"
12652,BOOK XXII.,"aim a dart at Hector, lest another might win the glory of having"
12653,BOOK XXII.,"hit him and he might himself come in second. Then, at last, as"
12654,BOOK XXII.,"they were nearing the fountains for the fourth time, the father"
12655,BOOK XXII.,of all balanced his golden scales and placed a doom in each of
12656,BOOK XXII.,"them, one for Achilles and the other for Hector. As he held the"
12657,BOOK XXII.,"scales by the middle, the doom of Hector fell down deep into the"
12658,BOOK XXII.,house of Hades—and then Phoebus Apollo left him. Thereon Minerva
12659,BOOK XXII.,"went close up to the son of Peleus and said, “Noble Achilles,"
12660,BOOK XXII.,"favoured of heaven, we two shall surely take back to the ships a"
12661,BOOK XXII.,"triumph for the Achaeans by slaying Hector, for all his lust of"
12662,BOOK XXII.,battle. Do what Apollo may as he lies grovelling before his
12663,BOOK XXII.,"father, aegis-bearing Jove, Hector cannot escape us longer. Stay"
12664,BOOK XXII.,"here and take breath, while I go up to him and persuade him to"
12665,BOOK XXII.,make a stand and fight you.”
12666,BOOK XXII.,
12667,BOOK XXII.,"Thus spoke Minerva. Achilles obeyed her gladly, and stood still,"
12668,BOOK XXII.,"leaning on his bronze-pointed ashen spear, while Minerva left him"
12669,BOOK XXII.,and went after Hector in the form and with the voice of
12670,BOOK XXII.,"Deiphobus. She came close up to him and said, “Dear brother, I"
12671,BOOK XXII.,see you are hard pressed by Achilles who is chasing you at full
12672,BOOK XXII.,"speed round the city of Priam, let us await his onset and stand"
12673,BOOK XXII.,on our defence.”
12674,BOOK XXII.,
12675,BOOK XXII.,"And Hector answered, “Deiphobus, you have always been dearest to"
12676,BOOK XXII.,"me of all my brothers, children of Hecuba and Priam, but"
12677,BOOK XXII.,"henceforth I shall rate you yet more highly, inasmuch as you have"
12678,BOOK XXII.,ventured outside the wall for my sake when all the others remain
12679,BOOK XXII.,inside.”
12680,BOOK XXII.,
12681,BOOK XXII.,"Then Minerva said, “Dear brother, my father and mother went down"
12682,BOOK XXII.,"on their knees and implored me, as did all my comrades, to remain"
12683,BOOK XXII.,"inside, so great a fear has fallen upon them all; but I was in an"
12684,BOOK XXII.,"agony of grief when I beheld you; now, therefore, let us two make"
12685,BOOK XXII.,"a stand and fight, and let there be no keeping our spears in"
12686,BOOK XXII.,"reserve, that we may learn whether Achilles shall kill us and"
12687,BOOK XXII.,"bear off our spoils to the ships, or whether he shall fall before"
12688,BOOK XXII.,you.”
12689,BOOK XXII.,
12690,BOOK XXII.,"Thus did Minerva inveigle him by her cunning, and when the two"
12691,BOOK XXII.,were now close to one another great Hector was first to speak. “I
12692,BOOK XXII.,"will no longer fly you, son of Peleus,” said he, “as I have been"
12693,BOOK XXII.,doing hitherto. Three times have I fled round the mighty city of
12694,BOOK XXII.,"Priam, without daring to withstand you, but now, let me either"
12695,BOOK XXII.,"slay or be slain, for I am in the mind to face you. Let us, then,"
12696,BOOK XXII.,"give pledges to one another by our gods, who are the fittest"
12697,BOOK XXII.,witnesses and guardians of all covenants; let it be agreed
12698,BOOK XXII.,between us that if Jove vouchsafes me the longer stay and I take
12699,BOOK XXII.,"your life, I am not to treat your dead body in any unseemly"
12700,BOOK XXII.,"fashion, but when I have stripped you of your armour, I am to"
12701,BOOK XXII.,give up your body to the Achaeans. And do you likewise.”
12702,BOOK XXII.,
12703,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles glared at him and answered, “Fool, prate not to me about"
12704,BOOK XXII.,"covenants. There can be no covenants between men and lions,"
12705,BOOK XXII.,"wolves and lambs can never be of one mind, but hate each other"
12706,BOOK XXII.,out and out all through. Therefore there can be no understanding
12707,BOOK XXII.,"between you and me, nor may there be any covenants between us,"
12708,BOOK XXII.,till one or other shall fall and glut grim Mars with his life’s
12709,BOOK XXII.,blood. Put forth all your strength; you have need now to prove
12710,BOOK XXII.,yourself indeed a bold soldier and man of war. You have no more
12711,BOOK XXII.,"chance, and Pallas Minerva will forthwith vanquish you by my"
12712,BOOK XXII.,spear: you shall now pay me in full for the grief you have caused
12713,BOOK XXII.,me on account of my comrades whom you have killed in battle.”
12714,BOOK XXII.,
12715,BOOK XXII.,He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. Hector saw it
12716,BOOK XXII.,coming and avoided it; he watched it and crouched down so that it
12717,BOOK XXII.,flew over his head and stuck in the ground beyond; Minerva then
12718,BOOK XXII.,snatched it up and gave it back to Achilles without Hector’s
12719,BOOK XXII.,"seeing her; Hector thereon said to the son of Peleus, “You have"
12720,BOOK XXII.,"missed your aim, Achilles, peer of the gods, and Jove has not yet"
12721,BOOK XXII.,"revealed to you the hour of my doom, though you made sure that he"
12722,BOOK XXII.,had done so. You were a false-tongued liar when you deemed that I
12723,BOOK XXII.,should forget my valour and quail before you. You shall not drive
12724,BOOK XXII.,"your spear into the back of a runaway—drive it, should heaven so"
12725,BOOK XXII.,"grant you power, drive it into me as I make straight towards you;"
12726,BOOK XXII.,and now for your own part avoid my spear if you can—would that
12727,BOOK XXII.,you might receive the whole of it into your body; if you were
12728,BOOK XXII.,"once dead the Trojans would find the war an easier matter, for it"
12729,BOOK XXII.,is you who have harmed them most.”
12730,BOOK XXII.,
12731,BOOK XXII.,He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it. His aim was true
12732,BOOK XXII.,"for he hit the middle of Achilles’ shield, but the spear"
12733,BOOK XXII.,"rebounded from it, and did not pierce it. Hector was angry when"
12734,BOOK XXII.,"he saw that the weapon had sped from his hand in vain, and stood"
12735,BOOK XXII.,there in dismay for he had no second spear. With a loud cry he
12736,BOOK XXII.,"called Deiphobus and asked him for one, but there was no man;"
12737,BOOK XXII.,"then he saw the truth and said to himself, “Alas! the gods have"
12738,BOOK XXII.,lured me on to my destruction. I deemed that the hero Deiphobus
12739,BOOK XXII.,"was by my side, but he is within the wall, and Minerva has"
12740,BOOK XXII.,inveigled me; death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and
12741,BOOK XXII.,there is no way out of it—for so Jove and his son Apollo the
12742,BOOK XXII.,"far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever"
12743,BOOK XXII.,ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then
12744,BOOK XXII.,"die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some"
12745,BOOK XXII.,great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.”
12746,BOOK XXII.,
12747,BOOK XXII.,As he spoke he drew the keen blade that hung so great and strong
12748,BOOK XXII.,"by his side, and gathering himself together be sprang on Achilles"
12749,BOOK XXII.,like a soaring eagle which swoops down from the clouds on to some
12750,BOOK XXII.,lamb or timid hare—even so did Hector brandish his sword and
12751,BOOK XXII.,"spring upon Achilles. Achilles mad with rage darted towards him,"
12752,BOOK XXII.,"with his wondrous shield before his breast, and his gleaming"
12753,BOOK XXII.,"helmet, made with four layers of metal, nodding fiercely forward."
12754,BOOK XXII.,The thick tresses of gold with which Vulcan had crested the
12755,BOOK XXII.,"helmet floated round it, and as the evening star that shines"
12756,BOOK XXII.,"brighter than all others through the stillness of night, even"
12757,BOOK XXII.,such was the gleam of the spear which Achilles poised in his
12758,BOOK XXII.,"right hand, fraught with the death of noble Hector. He eyed his"
12759,BOOK XXII.,"fair flesh over and over to see where he could best wound it, but"
12760,BOOK XXII.,all was protected by the goodly armour of which Hector had
12761,BOOK XXII.,"spoiled Patroclus after he had slain him, save only the throat"
12762,BOOK XXII.,"where the collar-bones divide the neck from the shoulders, and"
12763,BOOK XXII.,this is a most deadly place: here then did Achilles strike him as
12764,BOOK XXII.,"he was coming on towards him, and the point of his spear went"
12765,BOOK XXII.,"right through the fleshy part of the neck, but it did not sever"
12766,BOOK XXII.,"his windpipe so that he could still speak. Hector fell headlong,"
12767,BOOK XXII.,"and Achilles vaunted over him saying, “Hector, you deemed that"
12768,BOOK XXII.,"you should come off scatheless when you were spoiling Patroclus,"
12769,BOOK XXII.,and recked not of myself who was not with him. Fool that you
12770,BOOK XXII.,"were: for I, his comrade, mightier far than he, was still left"
12771,BOOK XXII.,"behind him at the ships, and now I have laid you low. The"
12772,BOOK XXII.,"Achaeans shall give him all due funeral rites, while dogs and"
12773,BOOK XXII.,vultures shall work their will upon yourself.”
12774,BOOK XXII.,
12775,BOOK XXII.,"Then Hector said, as the life ebbed out of him, “I pray you by"
12776,BOOK XXII.,"your life and knees, and by your parents, let not dogs devour me"
12777,BOOK XXII.,"at the ships of the Achaeans, but accept the rich treasure of"
12778,BOOK XXII.,"gold and bronze which my father and mother will offer you, and"
12779,BOOK XXII.,"send my body home, that the Trojans and their wives may give me"
12780,BOOK XXII.,my dues of fire when I am dead.”
12781,BOOK XXII.,
12782,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles glared at him and answered, “Dog, talk not to me neither"
12783,BOOK XXII.,of knees nor parents; would that I could be as sure of being able
12784,BOOK XXII.,"to cut your flesh into pieces and eat it raw, for the ill you"
12785,BOOK XXII.,"have done me, as I am that nothing shall save you from the"
12786,BOOK XXII.,"dogs—it shall not be, though they bring ten or twenty-fold ransom"
12787,BOOK XXII.,"and weigh it out for me on the spot, with promise of yet more"
12788,BOOK XXII.,hereafter. Though Priam son of Dardanus should bid them offer me
12789,BOOK XXII.,"your weight in gold, even so your mother shall never lay you out"
12790,BOOK XXII.,"and make lament over the son she bore, but dogs and vultures"
12791,BOOK XXII.,shall eat you utterly up.”
12792,BOOK XXII.,
12793,BOOK XXII.,"Hector with his dying breath then said, “I know you what you are,"
12794,BOOK XXII.,"and was sure that I should not move you, for your heart is hard"
12795,BOOK XXII.,as iron; look to it that I bring not heaven’s anger upon you on
12796,BOOK XXII.,"the day when Paris and Phoebus Apollo, valiant though you be,"
12797,BOOK XXII.,shall slay you at the Scaean gates.”
12798,BOOK XXII.,
12799,BOOK XXII.,"When he had thus said the shrouds of death enfolded him, whereon"
12800,BOOK XXII.,"his soul went out of him and flew down to the house of Hades,"
12801,BOOK XXII.,lamenting its sad fate that it should enjoy youth and strength no
12802,BOOK XXII.,"longer. But Achilles said, speaking to the dead body, “Die; for"
12803,BOOK XXII.,my part I will accept my fate whensoever Jove and the other gods
12804,BOOK XXII.,see fit to send it.”
12805,BOOK XXII.,
12806,BOOK XXII.,As he spoke he drew his spear from the body and set it on one
12807,BOOK XXII.,side; then he stripped the blood-stained armour from Hector’s
12808,BOOK XXII.,shoulders while the other Achaeans came running up to view his
12809,BOOK XXII.,wondrous strength and beauty; and no one came near him without
12810,BOOK XXII.,giving him a fresh wound. Then would one turn to his neighbour
12811,BOOK XXII.,"and say, “It is easier to handle Hector now than when he was"
12812,BOOK XXII.,flinging fire on to our ships”—and as he spoke he would thrust
12813,BOOK XXII.,his spear into him anew.
12814,BOOK XXII.,
12815,BOOK XXII.,"When Achilles had done spoiling Hector of his armour, he stood"
12816,BOOK XXII.,"among the Argives and said, “My friends, princes and counsellors"
12817,BOOK XXII.,"of the Argives, now that heaven has vouchsafed us to overcome"
12818,BOOK XXII.,"this man, who has done us more hurt than all the others together,"
12819,BOOK XXII.,"consider whether we should not attack the city in force, and"
12820,BOOK XXII.,discover in what mind the Trojans may be. We should thus learn
12821,BOOK XXII.,"whether they will desert their city now that Hector has fallen,"
12822,BOOK XXII.,or will still hold out even though he is no longer living. But
12823,BOOK XXII.,"why argue with myself in this way, while Patroclus is still lying"
12824,BOOK XXII.,"at the ships unburied, and unmourned—he whom I can never forget"
12825,BOOK XXII.,so long as I am alive and my strength fails not? Though men
12826,BOOK XXII.,"forget their dead when once they are within the house of Hades,"
12827,BOOK XXII.,yet not even there will I forget the comrade whom I have lost.
12828,BOOK XXII.,"Now, therefore, Achaean youths, let us raise the song of victory"
12829,BOOK XXII.,and go back to the ships taking this man along with us; for we
12830,BOOK XXII.,have achieved a mighty triumph and have slain noble Hector to
12831,BOOK XXII.,whom the Trojans prayed throughout their city as though he were a
12832,BOOK XXII.,god.”
12833,BOOK XXII.,
12834,BOOK XXII.,On this he treated the body of Hector with contumely: he pierced
12835,BOOK XXII.,the sinews at the back of both his feet from heel to ancle and
12836,BOOK XXII.,passed thongs of ox-hide through the slits he had made: thus he
12837,BOOK XXII.,"made the body fast to his chariot, letting the head trail upon"
12838,BOOK XXII.,the ground. Then when he had put the goodly armour on the chariot
12839,BOOK XXII.,"and had himself mounted, he lashed his horses on and they flew"
12840,BOOK XXII.,forward nothing loth. The dust rose from Hector as he was being
12841,BOOK XXII.,"dragged along, his dark hair flew all abroad, and his head once"
12842,BOOK XXII.,"so comely was laid low on earth, for Jove had now delivered him"
12843,BOOK XXII.,into the hands of his foes to do him outrage in his own land.
12844,BOOK XXII.,
12845,BOOK XXII.,Thus was the head of Hector being dishonoured in the dust. His
12846,BOOK XXII.,"mother tore her hair, and flung her veil from her with a loud cry"
12847,BOOK XXII.,"as she looked upon her son. His father made piteous moan, and"
12848,BOOK XXII.,throughout the city the people fell to weeping and wailing. It
12849,BOOK XXII.,was as though the whole of frowning Ilius was being smirched with
12850,BOOK XXII.,fire. Hardly could the people hold Priam back in his hot haste to
12851,BOOK XXII.,rush without the gates of the city. He grovelled in the mire and
12852,BOOK XXII.,"besought them, calling each one of them by his name. “Let be, my"
12853,BOOK XXII.,"friends,” he cried, “and for all your sorrow, suffer me to go"
12854,BOOK XXII.,single-handed to the ships of the Achaeans. Let me beseech this
12855,BOOK XXII.,"cruel and terrible man, if maybe he will respect the feeling of"
12856,BOOK XXII.,"his fellow-men, and have compassion on my old age. His own father"
12857,BOOK XXII.,"is even such another as myself—Peleus, who bred him and reared"
12858,BOOK XXII.,"him to be the bane of us Trojans, and of myself more than of all"
12859,BOOK XXII.,others. Many a son of mine has he slain in the flower of his
12860,BOOK XXII.,"youth, and yet, grieve for these as I may, I do so for"
12861,BOOK XXII.,"one—Hector—more than for them all, and the bitterness of my"
12862,BOOK XXII.,sorrow will bring me down to the house of Hades. Would that he
12863,BOOK XXII.,"had died in my arms, for so both his ill-starred mother who bore"
12864,BOOK XXII.,"him, and myself, should have had the comfort of weeping and"
12865,BOOK XXII.,mourning over him.”
12866,BOOK XXII.,
12867,BOOK XXII.,"Thus did he speak with many tears, and all the people of the city"
12868,BOOK XXII.,joined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing among
12869,BOOK XXII.,"the Trojans. “Alas, my son,” she cried, “what have I left to live"
12870,BOOK XXII.,for now that you are no more? Night and day did I glory in you
12871,BOOK XXII.,"throughout the city, for you were a tower of strength to all in"
12872,BOOK XXII.,"Troy, and both men and women alike hailed you as a god. So long"
12873,BOOK XXII.,"as you lived you were their pride, but now death and destruction"
12874,BOOK XXII.,have fallen upon you.”
12875,BOOK XXII.,
12876,BOOK XXII.,"Hector’s wife had as yet heard nothing, for no one had come to"
12877,BOOK XXII.,tell her that her husband had remained without the gates. She was
12878,BOOK XXII.,"at her loom in an inner part of the house, weaving a double"
12879,BOOK XXII.,"purple web, and embroidering it with many flowers. She told her"
12880,BOOK XXII.,"maids to set a large tripod on the fire, so as to have a warm"
12881,BOOK XXII.,"bath ready for Hector when he came out of battle; poor woman, she"
12882,BOOK XXII.,"knew not that he was now beyond the reach of baths, and that"
12883,BOOK XXII.,Minerva had laid him low by the hands of Achilles. She heard the
12884,BOOK XXII.,"cry coming as from the wall, and trembled in every limb; the"
12885,BOOK XXII.,"shuttle fell from her hands, and again she spoke to her"
12886,BOOK XXII.,"waiting-women. “Two of you,” she said, “come with me that I may"
12887,BOOK XXII.,learn what it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of my
12888,BOOK XXII.,husband’s honoured mother; my own heart beats as though it would
12889,BOOK XXII.,come into my mouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great
12890,BOOK XXII.,misfortune for Priam’s children must be at hand. May I never live
12891,BOOK XXII.,"to hear it, but I greatly fear that Achilles has cut off the"
12892,BOOK XXII.,retreat of brave Hector and has chased him on to the plain where
12893,BOOK XXII.,he was single-handed; I fear he may have put an end to the
12894,BOOK XXII.,"reckless daring which possessed my husband, who would never"
12895,BOOK XXII.,"remain with the body of his men, but would dash on far in front,"
12896,BOOK XXII.,foremost of them all in valour.”
12897,BOOK XXII.,
12898,BOOK XXII.,"Her heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew from the house"
12899,BOOK XXII.,"like a maniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she"
12900,BOOK XXII.,"reached the battlements and the crowd of people, she stood"
12901,BOOK XXII.,"looking out upon the wall, and saw Hector being borne away in"
12902,BOOK XXII.,front of the city—the horses dragging him without heed or care
12903,BOOK XXII.,over the ground towards the ships of the Achaeans. Her eyes were
12904,BOOK XXII.,then shrouded as with the darkness of night and she fell fainting
12905,BOOK XXII.,backwards. She tore the attiring from her head and flung it from
12906,BOOK XXII.,"her, the frontlet and net with its plaited band, and the veil"
12907,BOOK XXII.,which golden Venus had given her on the day when Hector took her
12908,BOOK XXII.,"with him from the house of Eetion, after having given countless"
12909,BOOK XXII.,gifts of wooing for her sake. Her husband’s sisters and the wives
12910,BOOK XXII.,"of his brothers crowded round her and supported her, for she was"
12911,BOOK XXII.,fain to die in her distraction; when she again presently breathed
12912,BOOK XXII.,"and came to herself, she sobbed and made lament among the Trojans"
12913,BOOK XXII.,"saying, “Woe is me, O Hector; woe, indeed, that to share a common"
12914,BOOK XXII.,"lot we were born, you at Troy in the house of Priam, and I at"
12915,BOOK XXII.,Thebes under the wooded mountain of Placus in the house of Eetion
12916,BOOK XXII.,who brought me up when I was a child—ill-starred sire of an
12917,BOOK XXII.,ill-starred daughter—would that he had never begotten me. You are
12918,BOOK XXII.,now going into the house of Hades under the secret places of the
12919,BOOK XXII.,"earth, and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your house. The"
12920,BOOK XXII.,"child, of whom you and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet a"
12921,BOOK XXII.,"mere infant. Now that you are gone, O Hector, you can do nothing"
12922,BOOK XXII.,for him nor he for you. Even though he escape the horrors of this
12923,BOOK XXII.,"woeful war with the Achaeans, yet shall his life henceforth be"
12924,BOOK XXII.,"one of labour and sorrow, for others will seize his lands. The"
12925,BOOK XXII.,day that robs a child of his parents severs him from his own
12926,BOOK XXII.,"kind; his head is bowed, his cheeks are wet with tears, and he"
12927,BOOK XXII.,"will go about destitute among the friends of his father, plucking"
12928,BOOK XXII.,one by the cloak and another by the shirt. Some one or other of
12929,BOOK XXII.,these may so far pity him as to hold the cup for a moment towards
12930,BOOK XXII.,"him and let him moisten his lips, but he must not drink enough to"
12931,BOOK XXII.,wet the roof of his mouth; then one whose parents are alive will
12932,BOOK XXII.,drive him from the table with blows and angry words. ‘Out with
12933,BOOK XXII.,"you,’ he will say, ‘you have no father here,’ and the child will"
12934,BOOK XXII.,"go crying back to his widowed mother—he, Astyanax, who erewhile"
12935,BOOK XXII.,"would sit upon his father’s knees, and have none but the"
12936,BOOK XXII.,daintiest and choicest morsels set before him. When he had played
12937,BOOK XXII.,"till he was tired and went to sleep, he would lie in a bed, in"
12938,BOOK XXII.,"the arms of his nurse, on a soft couch, knowing neither want nor"
12939,BOOK XXII.,"care, whereas now that he has lost his father his lot will be"
12940,BOOK XXII.,"full of hardship—he, whom the Trojans name Astyanax, because you,"
12941,BOOK XXII.,"O Hector, were the only defence of their gates and battlements."
12942,BOOK XXII.,"The wriggling writhing worms will now eat you at the ships, far"
12943,BOOK XXII.,"from your parents, when the dogs have glutted themselves upon"
12944,BOOK XXII.,"you. You will lie naked, although in your house you have fine and"
12945,BOOK XXII.,goodly raiment made by hands of women. This will I now burn; it
12946,BOOK XXII.,"is of no use to you, for you can never again wear it, and thus"
12947,BOOK XXII.,you will have respect shown you by the Trojans both men and
12948,BOOK XXII.,women.”
12949,BOOK XXII.,
12950,BOOK XXII.,"In such wise did she cry aloud amid her tears, and the women"
12951,BOOK XXII.,joined in her lament.
12952,BOOK XXII.,
12953,BOOK XXII.,
12954,BOOK XXII.,
12955,BOOK XXII.,
12956,BOOK XXIII.,BOOK XXIII.
12957,BOOK XXIII.,
12958,BOOK XXIII.,
12959,BOOK XXIII.,"The funeral of Patroclus, and the funeral games."
12960,BOOK XXIII.,
12961,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus did they make their moan throughout the city, while the"
12962,BOOK XXIII.,Achaeans when they reached the Hellespont went back every man to
12963,BOOK XXIII.,"his own ship. But Achilles would not let the Myrmidons go, and"
12964,BOOK XXIII.,"spoke to his brave comrades saying, “Myrmidons, famed horsemen"
12965,BOOK XXIII.,"and my own trusted friends, not yet, forsooth, let us unyoke, but"
12966,BOOK XXIII.,"with horse and chariot draw near to the body and mourn Patroclus,"
12967,BOOK XXIII.,in due honour to the dead. When we have had full comfort of
12968,BOOK XXIII.,lamentation we will unyoke our horses and take supper all of us
12969,BOOK XXIII.,here.”
12970,BOOK XXIII.,
12971,BOOK XXIII.,On this they all joined in a cry of wailing and Achilles led them
12972,BOOK XXIII.,in their lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all
12973,BOOK XXIII.,"sorrowing round the body, and Thetis stirred within them a still"
12974,BOOK XXIII.,deeper yearning. The sands of the sea-shore and the men’s armour
12975,BOOK XXIII.,"were wet with their weeping, so great a minister of fear was he"
12976,BOOK XXIII.,whom they had lost. Chief in all their mourning was the son of
12977,BOOK XXIII.,Peleus: he laid his blood-stained hand on the breast of his
12978,BOOK XXIII.,"friend. “Fare well,” he cried, “Patroclus, even in the house of"
12979,BOOK XXIII.,Hades. I will now do all that I erewhile promised you; I will
12980,BOOK XXIII.,drag Hector hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons
12981,BOOK XXIII.,of Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge you.”
12982,BOOK XXIII.,
12983,BOOK XXIII.,"As he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely,"
12984,BOOK XXIII.,laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of
12985,BOOK XXIII.,"Patroclus. The others then put off every man his armour, took the"
12986,BOOK XXIII.,"horses from their chariots, and seated themselves in great"
12987,BOOK XXIII.,"multitude by the ship of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, who"
12988,BOOK XXIII.,thereon feasted them with an abundant funeral banquet. Many a
12989,BOOK XXIII.,"goodly ox, with many a sheep and bleating goat did they butcher"
12990,BOOK XXIII.,"and cut up; many a tusked boar moreover, fat and well-fed, did"
12991,BOOK XXIII.,they singe and set to roast in the flames of Vulcan; and rivulets
12992,BOOK XXIII.,of blood flowed all round the place where the body was lying.
12993,BOOK XXIII.,
12994,BOOK XXIII.,Then the princes of the Achaeans took the son of Peleus to
12995,BOOK XXIII.,"Agamemnon, but hardly could they persuade him to come with them,"
12996,BOOK XXIII.,so wroth was he for the death of his comrade. As soon as they
12997,BOOK XXIII.,reached Agamemnon’s tent they told the serving-men to set a large
12998,BOOK XXIII.,tripod over the fire in case they might persuade the son of
12999,BOOK XXIII.,"Peleus to wash the clotted gore from this body, but he denied"
13000,BOOK XXIII.,"them sternly, and swore it with a solemn oath, saying, “Nay, by"
13001,BOOK XXIII.,"King Jove, first and mightiest of all gods, it is not meet that"
13002,BOOK XXIII.,"water should touch my body, till I have laid Patroclus on the"
13003,BOOK XXIII.,"flames, have built him a barrow, and shaved my head—for so long"
13004,BOOK XXIII.,"as I live no such second sorrow shall ever draw nigh me. Now,"
13005,BOOK XXIII.,"therefore, let us do all that this sad festival demands, but at"
13006,BOOK XXIII.,"break of day, King Agamemnon, bid your men bring wood, and"
13007,BOOK XXIII.,provide all else that the dead may duly take into the realm of
13008,BOOK XXIII.,darkness; the fire shall thus burn him out of our sight the
13009,BOOK XXIII.,"sooner, and the people shall turn again to their own labours.”"
13010,BOOK XXIII.,
13011,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. They made"
13012,BOOK XXIII.,"haste to prepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full"
13013,BOOK XXIII.,share so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough
13014,BOOK XXIII.,"to eat and drink, the others went to their rest each in his own"
13015,BOOK XXIII.,"tent, but the son of Peleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by"
13016,BOOK XXIII.,"the shore of the sounding sea, in an open place where the waves"
13017,BOOK XXIII.,came surging in one after another. Here a very deep slumber took
13018,BOOK XXIII.,"hold upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows, for his limbs"
13019,BOOK XXIII.,were weary with chasing Hector round windy Ilius. Presently the
13020,BOOK XXIII.,"sad spirit of Patroclus drew near him, like what he had been in"
13021,BOOK XXIII.,"stature, voice, and the light of his beaming eyes, clad, too, as"
13022,BOOK XXIII.,he had been clad in life. The spirit hovered over his head and
13023,BOOK XXIII.,said—
13024,BOOK XXIII.,
13025,BOOK XXIII.,"“You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you loved me living,"
13026,BOOK XXIII.,but now that I am dead you think for me no further. Bury me with
13027,BOOK XXIII.,"all speed that I may pass the gates of Hades; the ghosts, vain"
13028,BOOK XXIII.,"shadows of men that can labour no more, drive me away from them;"
13029,BOOK XXIII.,they will not yet suffer me to join those that are beyond the
13030,BOOK XXIII.,"river, and I wander all desolate by the wide gates of the house"
13031,BOOK XXIII.,"of Hades. Give me now your hand I pray you, for when you have"
13032,BOOK XXIII.,"once given me my dues of fire, never shall I again come forth out"
13033,BOOK XXIII.,of the house of Hades. Nevermore shall we sit apart and take
13034,BOOK XXIII.,sweet counsel among the living; the cruel fate which was my
13035,BOOK XXIII.,"birth-right has yawned its wide jaws around me—nay, you too"
13036,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath the wall of the"
13037,BOOK XXIII.,noble Trojans.
13038,BOOK XXIII.,
13039,BOOK XXIII.,"“One prayer more will I make you, if you will grant it; let not"
13040,BOOK XXIII.,"my bones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them; even"
13041,BOOK XXIII.,"as we were brought up together in your own home, what time"
13042,BOOK XXIII.,Menoetius brought me to you as a child from Opoeis because by a
13043,BOOK XXIII.,"sad spite I had killed the son of Amphidamas—not of set purpose,"
13044,BOOK XXIII.,but in childish quarrel over the dice. The knight Peleus took me
13045,BOOK XXIII.,"into his house, entreated me kindly, and named me to be your"
13046,BOOK XXIII.,"squire; therefore let our bones lie in but a single urn, the"
13047,BOOK XXIII.,two-handled golden vase given to you by your mother.”
13048,BOOK XXIII.,
13049,BOOK XXIII.,"And Achilles answered, “Why, true heart, are you come hither to"
13050,BOOK XXIII.,lay these charges upon me? I will of my own self do all as you
13051,BOOK XXIII.,"have bidden me. Draw closer to me, let us once more throw our"
13052,BOOK XXIII.,"arms around one another, and find sad comfort in the sharing of"
13053,BOOK XXIII.,our sorrows.”
13054,BOOK XXIII.,
13055,BOOK XXIII.,He opened his arms towards him as he spoke and would have clasped
13056,BOOK XXIII.,"him in them, but there was nothing, and the spirit vanished as a"
13057,BOOK XXIII.,"vapour, gibbering and whining into the earth. Achilles sprang to"
13058,BOOK XXIII.,"his feet, smote his two hands, and made lamentation saying, “Of a"
13059,BOOK XXIII.,truth even in the house of Hades there are ghosts and phantoms
13060,BOOK XXIII.,that have no life in them; all night long the sad spirit of
13061,BOOK XXIII.,"Patroclus has hovered over head making piteous moan, telling me"
13062,BOOK XXIII.,"what I am to do for him, and looking wondrously like himself.”"
13063,BOOK XXIII.,
13064,BOOK XXIII.,Thus did he speak and his words set them all weeping and mourning
13065,BOOK XXIII.,"about the poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn appeared. Then"
13066,BOOK XXIII.,"King Agamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to"
13067,BOOK XXIII.,"bring wood, and Meriones, squire to Idomeneus, was in charge over"
13068,BOOK XXIII.,them. They went out with woodmen’s axes and strong ropes in their
13069,BOOK XXIII.,"hands, and before them went the mules. Up hill and down dale did"
13070,BOOK XXIII.,"they go, by straight ways and crooked, and when they reached the"
13071,BOOK XXIII.,"heights of many-fountained Ida, they laid their axes to the roots"
13072,BOOK XXIII.,of many a tall branching oak that came thundering down as they
13073,BOOK XXIII.,"felled it. They split the trees and bound them behind the mules,"
13074,BOOK XXIII.,which then wended their way as they best could through the thick
13075,BOOK XXIII.,brushwood on to the plain. All who had been cutting wood bore
13076,BOOK XXIII.,"logs, for so Meriones squire to Idomeneus had bidden them, and"
13077,BOOK XXIII.,they threw them down in a line upon the sea-shore at the place
13078,BOOK XXIII.,where Achilles would make a mighty monument for Patroclus and for
13079,BOOK XXIII.,himself.
13080,BOOK XXIII.,
13081,BOOK XXIII.,When they had thrown down their great logs of wood over the whole
13082,BOOK XXIII.,"ground, they stayed all of them where they were, but Achilles"
13083,BOOK XXIII.,"ordered his brave Myrmidons to gird on their armour, and to yoke"
13084,BOOK XXIII.,"each man his horses; they therefore rose, girded on their armour"
13085,BOOK XXIII.,and mounted each his chariot—they and their charioteers with
13086,BOOK XXIII.,"them. The chariots went before, and they that were on foot"
13087,BOOK XXIII.,followed as a cloud in their tens of thousands after. In the
13088,BOOK XXIII.,midst of them his comrades bore Patroclus and covered him with
13089,BOOK XXIII.,the locks of their hair which they cut off and threw upon his
13090,BOOK XXIII.,"body. Last came Achilles with his head bowed for sorrow, so noble"
13091,BOOK XXIII.,a comrade was he taking to the house of Hades.
13092,BOOK XXIII.,
13093,BOOK XXIII.,When they came to the place of which Achilles had told them they
13094,BOOK XXIII.,laid the body down and built up the wood. Achilles then bethought
13095,BOOK XXIII.,"him of another matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and"
13096,BOOK XXIII.,cut off the yellow lock which he had let grow for the river
13097,BOOK XXIII.,"Spercheius. He looked all sorrowfully out upon the dark sea, and"
13098,BOOK XXIII.,"said, “Spercheius, in vain did my father Peleus vow to you that"
13099,BOOK XXIII.,when I returned home to my loved native land I should cut off
13100,BOOK XXIII.,this lock and offer you a holy hecatomb; fifty she-goats was I to
13101,BOOK XXIII.,"sacrifice to you there at your springs, where is your grove and"
13102,BOOK XXIII.,"your altar fragrant with burnt-offerings. Thus did my father vow,"
13103,BOOK XXIII.,"but you have not fulfilled his prayer; now, therefore, that I"
13104,BOOK XXIII.,"shall see my home no more, I give this lock as a keepsake to the"
13105,BOOK XXIII.,hero Patroclus.”
13106,BOOK XXIII.,
13107,BOOK XXIII.,"As he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of his dear comrade,"
13108,BOOK XXIII.,and all who stood by were filled with yearning and lamentation.
13109,BOOK XXIII.,The sun would have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles
13110,BOOK XXIII.,"presently said to Agamemnon, “Son of Atreus, for it is to you"
13111,BOOK XXIII.,"that the people will give ear, there is a time to mourn and a"
13112,BOOK XXIII.,time to cease from mourning; bid the people now leave the pyre
13113,BOOK XXIII.,"and set about getting their dinners: we, to whom the dead is"
13114,BOOK XXIII.,"dearest, will see to what is wanted here, and let the other"
13115,BOOK XXIII.,princes also stay by me.”
13116,BOOK XXIII.,
13117,BOOK XXIII.,When King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the people to their
13118,BOOK XXIII.,"ships, but those who were about the dead heaped up wood and built"
13119,BOOK XXIII.,a pyre a hundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead
13120,BOOK XXIII.,all sorrowfully upon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many
13121,BOOK XXIII.,"fat sheep and oxen before the pyre, and Achilles took fat from"
13122,BOOK XXIII.,"all of them and wrapped the body therein from head to foot,"
13123,BOOK XXIII.,heaping the flayed carcases all round it. Against the bier he
13124,BOOK XXIII.,leaned two-handled jars of honey and unguents; four proud horses
13125,BOOK XXIII.,"did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning the while he did so. The"
13126,BOOK XXIII.,dead hero had had house-dogs; two of them did Achilles slay and
13127,BOOK XXIII.,threw upon the pyre; he also put twelve brave sons of noble
13128,BOOK XXIII.,"Trojans to the sword and laid them with the rest, for he was full"
13129,BOOK XXIII.,of bitterness and fury. Then he committed all to the resistless
13130,BOOK XXIII.,and devouring might of the fire; he groaned aloud and called on
13131,BOOK XXIII.,"his dead comrade by name. “Fare well,” he cried, “Patroclus, even"
13132,BOOK XXIII.,in the house of Hades; I am now doing all that I have promised
13133,BOOK XXIII.,you. Twelve brave sons of noble Trojans shall the flames consume
13134,BOOK XXIII.,"along with yourself, but dogs, not fire, shall devour the flesh"
13135,BOOK XXIII.,of Hector son of Priam.”
13136,BOOK XXIII.,
13137,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about the body of"
13138,BOOK XXIII.,"Hector, for Jove’s daughter Venus kept them off him night and"
13139,BOOK XXIII.,"day, and anointed him with ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh"
13140,BOOK XXIII.,might not be torn when Achilles was dragging him about. Phoebus
13141,BOOK XXIII.,"Apollo moreover sent a dark cloud from heaven to earth, which"
13142,BOOK XXIII.,"gave shade to the whole place where Hector lay, that the heat of"
13143,BOOK XXIII.,the sun might not parch his body.
13144,BOOK XXIII.,
13145,BOOK XXIII.,Now the pyre about dead Patroclus would not kindle. Achilles
13146,BOOK XXIII.,therefore bethought him of another matter; he went apart and
13147,BOOK XXIII.,prayed to the two winds Boreas and Zephyrus vowing them goodly
13148,BOOK XXIII.,offerings. He made them many drink-offerings from the golden cup
13149,BOOK XXIII.,and besought them to come and help him that the wood might make
13150,BOOK XXIII.,haste to kindle and the dead bodies be consumed. Fleet Iris heard
13151,BOOK XXIII.,him praying and started off to fetch the winds. They were holding
13152,BOOK XXIII.,high feast in the house of boisterous Zephyrus when Iris came
13153,BOOK XXIII.,"running up to the stone threshold of the house and stood there,"
13154,BOOK XXIII.,but as soon as they set eyes on her they all came towards her and
13155,BOOK XXIII.,"each of them called her to him, but Iris would not sit down. “I"
13156,BOOK XXIII.,"cannot stay,” she said, “I must go back to the streams of Oceanus"
13157,BOOK XXIII.,and the land of the Ethiopians who are offering hecatombs to the
13158,BOOK XXIII.,"immortals, and I would have my share; but Achilles prays that"
13159,BOOK XXIII.,"Boreas and shrill Zephyrus will come to him, and he vows them"
13160,BOOK XXIII.,goodly offerings; he would have you blow upon the pyre of
13161,BOOK XXIII.,Patroclus for whom all the Achaeans are lamenting.”
13162,BOOK XXIII.,
13163,BOOK XXIII.,"With this she left them, and the two winds rose with a cry that"
13164,BOOK XXIII.,rent the air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and
13165,BOOK XXIII.,"on until they came to the sea, and the waves rose high beneath"
13166,BOOK XXIII.,"them, but when they reached Troy they fell upon the pyre till the"
13167,BOOK XXIII.,mighty flames roared under the blast that they blew. All night
13168,BOOK XXIII.,"long did they blow hard and beat upon the fire, and all night"
13169,BOOK XXIII.,"long did Achilles grasp his double cup, drawing wine from a"
13170,BOOK XXIII.,"mixing-bowl of gold, and calling upon the spirit of dead"
13171,BOOK XXIII.,Patroclus as he poured it upon the ground until the earth was
13172,BOOK XXIII.,drenched. As a father mourns when he is burning the bones of his
13173,BOOK XXIII.,"bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of his parents,"
13174,BOOK XXIII.,"even so did Achilles mourn while burning the body of his comrade,"
13175,BOOK XXIII.,pacing round the bier with piteous groaning and lamentation.
13176,BOOK XXIII.,
13177,BOOK XXIII.,At length as the Morning Star was beginning to herald the light
13178,BOOK XXIII.,"which saffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea, the"
13179,BOOK XXIII.,flames fell and the fire began to die. The winds then went home
13180,BOOK XXIII.,"beyond the Thracian sea, which roared and boiled as they swept"
13181,BOOK XXIII.,over it. The son of Peleus now turned away from the pyre and lay
13182,BOOK XXIII.,"down, overcome with toil, till he fell into a sweet slumber."
13183,BOOK XXIII.,Presently they who were about the son of Atreus drew near in a
13184,BOOK XXIII.,"body, and roused him with the noise and tramp of their coming. He"
13185,BOOK XXIII.,"sat upright and said, “Son of Atreus, and all other princes of"
13186,BOOK XXIII.,"the Achaeans, first pour red wine everywhere upon the fire and"
13187,BOOK XXIII.,quench it; let us then gather the bones of Patroclus son of
13188,BOOK XXIII.,"Menoetius, singling them out with care; they are easily found,"
13189,BOOK XXIII.,"for they lie in the middle of the pyre, while all else, both men"
13190,BOOK XXIII.,"and horses, has been thrown in a heap and burned at the outer"
13191,BOOK XXIII.,"edge. We will lay the bones in a golden urn, in two layers of"
13192,BOOK XXIII.,"fat, against the time when I shall myself go down into the house"
13193,BOOK XXIII.,"of Hades. As for the barrow, labour not to raise a great one now,"
13194,BOOK XXIII.,"but such as is reasonable. Afterwards, let those Achaeans who may"
13195,BOOK XXIII.,"be left at the ships when I am gone, build it both broad and"
13196,BOOK XXIII.,high.”
13197,BOOK XXIII.,
13198,BOOK XXIII.,Thus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the son of Peleus.
13199,BOOK XXIII.,First they poured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and
13200,BOOK XXIII.,quenched the fire. With many tears they singled out the whitened
13201,BOOK XXIII.,bones of their loved comrade and laid them within a golden urn in
13202,BOOK XXIII.,two layers of fat: they then covered the urn with a linen cloth
13203,BOOK XXIII.,and took it inside the tent. They marked off the circle where the
13204,BOOK XXIII.,"barrow should be, made a foundation for it about the pyre, and"
13205,BOOK XXIII.,forthwith heaped up the earth. When they had thus raised a mound
13206,BOOK XXIII.,"they were going away, but Achilles stayed the people and made"
13207,BOOK XXIII.,"them sit in assembly. He brought prizes from the ships—cauldrons,"
13208,BOOK XXIII.,"tripods, horses and mules, noble oxen, women with fair girdles,"
13209,BOOK XXIII.,and swart iron.
13210,BOOK XXIII.,
13211,BOOK XXIII.,The first prize he offered was for the chariot races—a woman
13212,BOOK XXIII.,"skilled in all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that had"
13213,BOOK XXIII.,"ears for handles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was"
13214,BOOK XXIII.,for the man who came in first. For the second there was a
13215,BOOK XXIII.,"six-year old mare, unbroken, and in foal to a he-ass; the third"
13216,BOOK XXIII.,was to have a goodly cauldron that had never yet been on the
13217,BOOK XXIII.,"fire; it was still bright as when it left the maker, and would"
13218,BOOK XXIII.,"hold four measures. The fourth prize was two talents of gold, and"
13219,BOOK XXIII.,the fifth a two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by smoke. Then he
13220,BOOK XXIII.,stood up and spoke among the Argives saying—
13221,BOOK XXIII.,
13222,BOOK XXIII.,"“Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these are the prizes that"
13223,BOOK XXIII.,lie waiting the winners of the chariot races. At any other time I
13224,BOOK XXIII.,should carry off the first prize and take it to my own tent; you
13225,BOOK XXIII.,know how far my steeds excel all others—for they are immortal;
13226,BOOK XXIII.,"Neptune gave them to my father Peleus, who in his turn gave them"
13227,BOOK XXIII.,"to myself; but I shall hold aloof, I and my steeds that have lost"
13228,BOOK XXIII.,"their brave and kind driver, who many a time has washed them in"
13229,BOOK XXIII.,clear water and anointed their manes with oil. See how they stand
13230,BOOK XXIII.,"weeping here, with their manes trailing on the ground in the"
13231,BOOK XXIII.,extremity of their sorrow. But do you others set yourselves in
13232,BOOK XXIII.,"order throughout the host, whosoever has confidence in his horses"
13233,BOOK XXIII.,and in the strength of his chariot.”
13234,BOOK XXIII.,
13235,BOOK XXIII.,Thus spoke the son of Peleus and the drivers of chariots
13236,BOOK XXIII.,"bestirred themselves. First among them all uprose Eumelus, king"
13237,BOOK XXIII.,"of men, son of Admetus, a man excellent in horsemanship. Next to"
13238,BOOK XXIII.,him rose mighty Diomed son of Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses
13239,BOOK XXIII.,"which he had taken from Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the"
13240,BOOK XXIII.,"fight. Next to him, yellow-haired Menelaus son of Atreus rose and"
13241,BOOK XXIII.,"yoked his fleet horses, Agamemnon’s mare Aethe, and his own horse"
13242,BOOK XXIII.,Podargus. The mare had been given to Agamemnon by Echepolus son
13243,BOOK XXIII.,"of Anchises, that he might not have to follow him to Ilius, but"
13244,BOOK XXIII.,might stay at home and take his ease; for Jove had endowed him
13245,BOOK XXIII.,"with great wealth and he lived in spacious Sicyon. This mare, all"
13246,BOOK XXIII.,"eager for the race, did Menelaus put under the yoke."
13247,BOOK XXIII.,
13248,BOOK XXIII.,"Fourth in order Antilochus, son to noble Nestor son of Neleus,"
13249,BOOK XXIII.,"made ready his horses. These were bred in Pylos, and his father"
13250,BOOK XXIII.,"came up to him to give him good advice of which, however, he"
13251,BOOK XXIII.,"stood in but little need. “Antilochus,” said Nestor, “you are"
13252,BOOK XXIII.,"young, but Jove and Neptune have loved you well, and have made"
13253,BOOK XXIII.,you an excellent horseman. I need not therefore say much by way
13254,BOOK XXIII.,of instruction. You are skilful at wheeling your horses round the
13255,BOOK XXIII.,"post, but the horses themselves are very slow, and it is this"
13256,BOOK XXIII.,"that will, I fear, mar your chances. The other drivers know less"
13257,BOOK XXIII.,"than you do, but their horses are fleeter; therefore, my dear"
13258,BOOK XXIII.,"son, see if you cannot hit upon some artifice whereby you may"
13259,BOOK XXIII.,insure that the prize shall not slip through your fingers. The
13260,BOOK XXIII.,woodman does more by skill than by brute force; by skill the
13261,BOOK XXIII.,"pilot guides his storm-tossed barque over the sea, and so by"
13262,BOOK XXIII.,skill one driver can beat another. If a man go wide in rounding
13263,BOOK XXIII.,"this way and that, whereas a man who knows what he is doing may"
13264,BOOK XXIII.,"have worse horses, but he will keep them well in hand when he"
13265,BOOK XXIII.,sees the doubling-post; he knows the precise moment at which to
13266,BOOK XXIII.,"pull the rein, and keeps his eye well on the man in front of him."
13267,BOOK XXIII.,I will give you this certain token which cannot escape your
13268,BOOK XXIII.,notice. There is a stump of a dead tree—oak or pine as it may
13269,BOOK XXIII.,"be—some six feet above the ground, and not yet rotted away by"
13270,BOOK XXIII.,rain; it stands at the fork of the road; it has two white stones
13271,BOOK XXIII.,"set one on each side, and there is a clear course all round it."
13272,BOOK XXIII.,"It may have been a monument to some one long since dead, or it"
13273,BOOK XXIII.,"may have been used as a doubling-post in days gone by; now,"
13274,BOOK XXIII.,"however, it has been fixed on by Achilles as the mark round which"
13275,BOOK XXIII.,"the chariots shall turn; hug it as close as you can, but as you"
13276,BOOK XXIII.,stand in your chariot lean over a little to the left; urge on
13277,BOOK XXIII.,"your right-hand horse with voice and lash, and give him a loose"
13278,BOOK XXIII.,"rein, but let the left-hand horse keep so close in, that the nave"
13279,BOOK XXIII.,"of your wheel shall almost graze the post; but mind the stone, or"
13280,BOOK XXIII.,"you will wound your horses and break your chariot in pieces,"
13281,BOOK XXIII.,which would be sport for others but confusion for yourself.
13282,BOOK XXIII.,"Therefore, my dear son, mind well what you are about, for if you"
13283,BOOK XXIII.,can be first to round the post there is no chance of any one
13284,BOOK XXIII.,"giving you the go-by later, not even though you had Adrestus’s"
13285,BOOK XXIII.,horse Arion behind you—a horse which is of divine race—or those
13286,BOOK XXIII.,"of Laomedon, which are the noblest in this country.”"
13287,BOOK XXIII.,
13288,BOOK XXIII.,When Nestor had made an end of counselling his son he sat down in
13289,BOOK XXIII.,"his place, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses. They"
13290,BOOK XXIII.,then all mounted their chariots and cast lots. Achilles shook the
13291,BOOK XXIII.,"helmet, and the lot of Antilochus son of Nestor fell out first;"
13292,BOOK XXIII.,"next came that of King Eumelus, and after his, those of Menelaus"
13293,BOOK XXIII.,son of Atreus and of Meriones. The last place fell to the lot of
13294,BOOK XXIII.,"Diomed son of Tydeus, who was the best man of them all. They took"
13295,BOOK XXIII.,their places in line; Achilles showed them the doubling-post
13296,BOOK XXIII.,"round which they were to turn, some way off upon the plain; here"
13297,BOOK XXIII.,"he stationed his father’s follower Phoenix as umpire, to note the"
13298,BOOK XXIII.,"running, and report truly."
13299,BOOK XXIII.,
13300,BOOK XXIII.,"At the same instant they all of them lashed their horses, struck"
13301,BOOK XXIII.,"them with the reins, and shouted at them with all their might."
13302,BOOK XXIII.,"They flew full speed over the plain away from the ships, the dust"
13303,BOOK XXIII.,"rose from under them as it were a cloud or whirlwind, and their"
13304,BOOK XXIII.,manes were all flying in the wind. At one moment the chariots
13305,BOOK XXIII.,"seemed to touch the ground, and then again they bounded into the"
13306,BOOK XXIII.,"air; the drivers stood erect, and their hearts beat fast and"
13307,BOOK XXIII.,furious in their lust of victory. Each kept calling on his
13308,BOOK XXIII.,"horses, and the horses scoured the plain amid the clouds of dust"
13309,BOOK XXIII.,that they raised.
13310,BOOK XXIII.,
13311,BOOK XXIII.,It was when they were doing the last part of the course on their
13312,BOOK XXIII.,way back towards the sea that their pace was strained to the
13313,BOOK XXIII.,utmost and it was seen what each could do. The horses of the
13314,BOOK XXIII.,"descendant of Pheres now took the lead, and close behind them"
13315,BOOK XXIII.,came the Trojan stallions of Diomed. They seemed as if about to
13316,BOOK XXIII.,"mount Eumelus’s chariot, and he could feel their warm breath on"
13317,BOOK XXIII.,"his back and on his broad shoulders, for their heads were close"
13318,BOOK XXIII.,to him as they flew over the course. Diomed would have now passed
13319,BOOK XXIII.,"him, or there would have been a dead heat, but Phoebus Apollo to"
13320,BOOK XXIII.,spite him made him drop his whip. Tears of anger fell from his
13321,BOOK XXIII.,"eyes as he saw the mares going on faster than ever, while his own"
13322,BOOK XXIII.,horses lost ground through his having no whip. Minerva saw the
13323,BOOK XXIII.,"trick which Apollo had played the son of Tydeus, so she brought"
13324,BOOK XXIII.,him his whip and put spirit into his horses; moreover she went
13325,BOOK XXIII.,after the son of Admetus in a rage and broke his yoke for him;
13326,BOOK XXIII.,"the mares went one to one side of the course, and the other to"
13327,BOOK XXIII.,"the other, and the pole was broken against the ground. Eumelus"
13328,BOOK XXIII.,"was thrown from his chariot close to the wheel; his elbows,"
13329,BOOK XXIII.,"mouth, and nostrils were all torn, and his forehead was bruised"
13330,BOOK XXIII.,above his eyebrows; his eyes filled with tears and he could find
13331,BOOK XXIII.,no utterance. But the son of Tydeus turned his horses aside and
13332,BOOK XXIII.,"shot far ahead, for Minerva put fresh strength into them and"
13333,BOOK XXIII.,covered Diomed himself with glory.
13334,BOOK XXIII.,
13335,BOOK XXIII.,"Menelaus son of Atreus came next behind him, but Antilochus"
13336,BOOK XXIII.,"called to his father’s horses. “On with you both,” he cried, “and"
13337,BOOK XXIII.,do your very utmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of
13338,BOOK XXIII.,"the son of Tydeus, for Minerva has put running into them, and has"
13339,BOOK XXIII.,covered Diomed with glory; but you must overtake the horses of
13340,BOOK XXIII.,"the son of Atreus and not be left behind, or Aethe who is so"
13341,BOOK XXIII.,"fleet will taunt you. Why, my good fellows, are you lagging? I"
13342,BOOK XXIII.,"tell you, and it shall surely be—Nestor will keep neither of you,"
13343,BOOK XXIII.,"but will put both of you to the sword, if we win any the worse a"
13344,BOOK XXIII.,prize through your carelessness. Fly after them at your utmost
13345,BOOK XXIII.,speed; I will hit on a plan for passing them in a narrow part of
13346,BOOK XXIII.,"the way, and it shall not fail me.”"
13347,BOOK XXIII.,
13348,BOOK XXIII.,"They feared the rebuke of their master, and for a short space"
13349,BOOK XXIII.,went quicker. Presently Antilochus saw a narrow place where the
13350,BOOK XXIII.,"road had sunk. The ground was broken, for the winter’s rain had"
13351,BOOK XXIII.,gathered and had worn the road so that the whole place was
13352,BOOK XXIII.,deepened. Menelaus was making towards it so as to get there
13353,BOOK XXIII.,"first, for fear of a foul, but Antilochus turned his horses out"
13354,BOOK XXIII.,"of the way, and followed him a little on one side. The son of"
13355,BOOK XXIII.,"Atreus was afraid and shouted out, “Antilochus, you are driving"
13356,BOOK XXIII.,"recklessly; rein in your horses; the road is too narrow here, it"
13357,BOOK XXIII.,"will be wider soon, and you can pass me then; if you foul my"
13358,BOOK XXIII.,chariot you may bring both of us to a mischief.”
13359,BOOK XXIII.,
13360,BOOK XXIII.,"But Antilochus plied his whip, and drove faster, as though he had"
13361,BOOK XXIII.,not heard him. They went side by side for about as far as a young
13362,BOOK XXIII.,man can hurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his
13363,BOOK XXIII.,"strength, and then Menelaus’s mares drew behind, for he left off"
13364,BOOK XXIII.,driving for fear the horses should foul one another and upset the
13365,BOOK XXIII.,"chariots; thus, while pressing on in quest of victory, they might"
13366,BOOK XXIII.,both come headlong to the ground. Menelaus then upbraided
13367,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus and said, “There is no greater trickster living than"
13368,BOOK XXIII.,"you are; go, and bad luck go with you; the Achaeans say not well"
13369,BOOK XXIII.,"that you have understanding, and come what may you shall not bear"
13370,BOOK XXIII.,away the prize without sworn protest on my part.”
13371,BOOK XXIII.,
13372,BOOK XXIII.,"Then he called on his horses and said to them, “Keep your pace,"
13373,BOOK XXIII.,and slacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary sooner
13374,BOOK XXIII.,"than yours, for they are neither of them young.”"
13375,BOOK XXIII.,
13376,BOOK XXIII.,"The horses feared the rebuke of their master, and went faster, so"
13377,BOOK XXIII.,that they were soon nearly up with the others.
13378,BOOK XXIII.,
13379,BOOK XXIII.,Meanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were watching how the
13380,BOOK XXIII.,"horses went, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their own"
13381,BOOK XXIII.,dust. Idomeneus captain of the Cretans was first to make out the
13382,BOOK XXIII.,"running, for he was not in the thick of the crowd, but stood on"
13383,BOOK XXIII.,the most commanding part of the ground. The driver was a long way
13384,BOOK XXIII.,"off, but Idomeneus could hear him shouting, and could see the"
13385,BOOK XXIII.,"foremost horse quite plainly—a chestnut with a round white star,"
13386,BOOK XXIII.,"like the moon, on its forehead. He stood up and said among the"
13387,BOOK XXIII.,"Argives, “My friends, princes and counsellors of the Argives, can"
13388,BOOK XXIII.,you see the running as well as I can? There seems to be another
13389,BOOK XXIII.,"pair in front now, and another driver; those that led off at the"
13390,BOOK XXIII.,start must have been disabled out on the plain. I saw them at
13391,BOOK XXIII.,"first making their way round the doubling-post, but now, though I"
13392,BOOK XXIII.,"search the plain of Troy, I cannot find them. Perhaps the reins"
13393,BOOK XXIII.,fell from the driver’s hand so that he lost command of his horses
13394,BOOK XXIII.,"at the doubling-post, and could not turn it. I suppose he must"
13395,BOOK XXIII.,"have been thrown out there, and broken his chariot, while his"
13396,BOOK XXIII.,mares have left the course and gone off wildly in a panic. Come
13397,BOOK XXIII.,"up and see for yourselves, I cannot make out for certain, but the"
13398,BOOK XXIII.,"driver seems an Aetolian by descent, ruler over the Argives,"
13399,BOOK XXIII.,brave Diomed the son of Tydeus.”
13400,BOOK XXIII.,
13401,BOOK XXIII.,"Ajax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and said, “Idomeneus,"
13402,BOOK XXIII.,"why should you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it, when"
13403,BOOK XXIII.,the mares are still so far out upon the plain? You are none of
13404,BOOK XXIII.,"the youngest, nor your eyes none of the sharpest, but you are"
13405,BOOK XXIII.,"always laying down the law. You have no right to do so, for there"
13406,BOOK XXIII.,are better men here than you are. Eumelus’s horses are in front
13407,BOOK XXIII.,"now, as they always have been, and he is on the chariot holding"
13408,BOOK XXIII.,the reins.”
13409,BOOK XXIII.,
13410,BOOK XXIII.,"The captain of the Cretans was angry, and answered, “Ajax you are"
13411,BOOK XXIII.,"an excellent railer, but you have no judgement, and are wanting"
13412,BOOK XXIII.,"in much else as well, for you have a vile temper. I will wager"
13413,BOOK XXIII.,"you a tripod or cauldron, and Agamemnon son of Atreus shall"
13414,BOOK XXIII.,decide whose horses are first. You will then know to your cost.”
13415,BOOK XXIII.,
13416,BOOK XXIII.,"Ajax son of Oileus was for making him an angry answer, and there"
13417,BOOK XXIII.,"would have been yet further brawling between them, had not"
13418,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles risen in his place and said, “Cease your railing, Ajax"
13419,BOOK XXIII.,and Idomeneus; it is not seemly; you would be scandalised if you
13420,BOOK XXIII.,saw any one else do the like: sit down and keep your eyes on the
13421,BOOK XXIII.,horses; they are speeding towards the winning-post and will be
13422,BOOK XXIII.,here directly. You will then both of you know whose horses are
13423,BOOK XXIII.,"first, and whose come after.”"
13424,BOOK XXIII.,
13425,BOOK XXIII.,"As he was speaking, the son of Tydeus came driving in, plying his"
13426,BOOK XXIII.,"whip lustily from his shoulder, and his horses stepping high as"
13427,BOOK XXIII.,they flew over the course. The sand and grit rained thick on the
13428,BOOK XXIII.,"driver, and the chariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind"
13429,BOOK XXIII.,his fleet horses. There was little trace of wheel-marks in the
13430,BOOK XXIII.,"fine dust, and the horses came flying in at their utmost speed."
13431,BOOK XXIII.,"Diomed stayed them in the middle of the crowd, and the sweat from"
13432,BOOK XXIII.,their manes and chests fell in streams on to the ground.
13433,BOOK XXIII.,"Forthwith he sprang from his goodly chariot, and leaned his whip"
13434,BOOK XXIII.,"against his horses’ yoke; brave Sthenelus now lost no time, but"
13435,BOOK XXIII.,"at once brought on the prize, and gave the woman and the"
13436,BOOK XXIII.,ear-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away. Then he
13437,BOOK XXIII.,unyoked the horses.
13438,BOOK XXIII.,
13439,BOOK XXIII.,"Next after him came in Antilochus of the race of Neleus, who had"
13440,BOOK XXIII.,passed Menelaus by a trick and not by the fleetness of his
13441,BOOK XXIII.,horses; but even so Menelaus came in as close behind him as the
13442,BOOK XXIII.,wheel is to the horse that draws both the chariot and its master.
13443,BOOK XXIII.,"The end hairs of a horse’s tail touch the tyre of the wheel, and"
13444,BOOK XXIII.,there is never much space between wheel and horse when the
13445,BOOK XXIII.,chariot is going; Menelaus was no further than this behind
13446,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus, though at first he had been a full disc’s throw"
13447,BOOK XXIII.,"behind him. He had soon caught him up again, for Agamemnon’s mare"
13448,BOOK XXIII.,"Aethe kept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the course"
13449,BOOK XXIII.,"had been longer he would have passed him, and there would not"
13450,BOOK XXIII.,even have been a dead heat. Idomeneus’s brave squire Meriones was
13451,BOOK XXIII.,about a spear’s cast behind Menelaus. His horses were slowest of
13452,BOOK XXIII.,"all, and he was the worst driver. Last of them all came the son"
13453,BOOK XXIII.,"of Admetus, dragging his chariot and driving his horses on in"
13454,BOOK XXIII.,"front. When Achilles saw him he was sorry, and stood up among the"
13455,BOOK XXIII.,"Argives saying, “The best man is coming in last. Let us give him"
13456,BOOK XXIII.,"a prize for it is reasonable. He shall have the second, but the"
13457,BOOK XXIII.,first must go to the son of Tydeus.”
13458,BOOK XXIII.,
13459,BOOK XXIII.,Thus did he speak and the others all of them applauded his
13460,BOOK XXIII.,"saying, and were for doing as he had said, but Nestor’s son"
13461,BOOK XXIII.,Antilochus stood up and claimed his rights from the son of
13462,BOOK XXIII.,"Peleus. “Achilles,” said he, “I shall take it much amiss if you"
13463,BOOK XXIII.,"do this thing; you would rob me of my prize, because you think"
13464,BOOK XXIII.,"Eumelus’s chariot and horses were thrown out, and himself too,"
13465,BOOK XXIII.,good man that he is. He should have prayed duly to the immortals;
13466,BOOK XXIII.,he would not have come in last if he had done so. If you are
13467,BOOK XXIII.,"sorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in your tents,"
13468,BOOK XXIII.,"with bronze, sheep, cattle and horses. Take something from this"
13469,BOOK XXIII.,"store if you would have the Achaeans speak well of you, and give"
13470,BOOK XXIII.,him a better prize even than that which you have now offered; but
13471,BOOK XXIII.,"I will not give up the mare, and he that will fight me for her,"
13472,BOOK XXIII.,let him come on.”
13473,BOOK XXIII.,
13474,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles smiled as he heard this, and was pleased with"
13475,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus, who was one of his dearest comrades. So he said—"
13476,BOOK XXIII.,
13477,BOOK XXIII.,"“Antilochus, if you would have me find Eumelus another prize, I"
13478,BOOK XXIII.,will give him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running
13479,BOOK XXIII.,all round it which I took from Asteropaeus. It will be worth much
13480,BOOK XXIII.,money to him.”
13481,BOOK XXIII.,
13482,BOOK XXIII.,He bade his comrade Automedon bring the breastplate from his
13483,BOOK XXIII.,"tent, and he did so. Achilles then gave it over to Eumelus, who"
13484,BOOK XXIII.,received it gladly.
13485,BOOK XXIII.,
13486,BOOK XXIII.,"But Menelaus got up in a rage, furiously angry with Antilochus."
13487,BOOK XXIII.,An attendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the Argives
13488,BOOK XXIII.,"keep silence: the hero then addressed them. “Antilochus,” said"
13489,BOOK XXIII.,"he, “what is this from you who have been so far blameless? You"
13490,BOOK XXIII.,have made me cut a poor figure and baulked my horses by flinging
13491,BOOK XXIII.,"your own in front of them, though yours are much worse than mine"
13492,BOOK XXIII.,"are; therefore, O princes and counsellors of the Argives, judge"
13493,BOOK XXIII.,"between us and show no favour, lest one of the Achaeans say,"
13494,BOOK XXIII.,‘Menelaus has got the mare through lying and corruption; his
13495,BOOK XXIII.,"horses were far inferior to Antilochus’s, but he has greater"
13496,BOOK XXIII.,"weight and influence.’ Nay, I will determine the matter myself,"
13497,BOOK XXIII.,"and no man will blame me, for I shall do what is just. Come here,"
13498,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus, and stand, as our custom is, whip in hand before your"
13499,BOOK XXIII.,"chariot and horses; lay your hand on your steeds, and swear by"
13500,BOOK XXIII.,earth-encircling Neptune that you did not purposely and
13501,BOOK XXIII.,guilefully get in the way of my horses.”
13502,BOOK XXIII.,
13503,BOOK XXIII.,"And Antilochus answered, “Forgive me; I am much younger, King"
13504,BOOK XXIII.,"Menelaus, than you are; you stand higher than I do and are the"
13505,BOOK XXIII.,better man of the two; you know how easily young men are betrayed
13506,BOOK XXIII.,into indiscretion; their tempers are more hasty and they have
13507,BOOK XXIII.,"less judgement; make due allowances therefore, and bear with me;"
13508,BOOK XXIII.,"I will of my own accord give up the mare that I have won, and if"
13509,BOOK XXIII.,"you claim any further chattel from my own possessions, I would"
13510,BOOK XXIII.,"rather yield it to you, at once, than fall from your good graces"
13511,BOOK XXIII.,"henceforth, and do wrong in the sight of heaven.”"
13512,BOOK XXIII.,
13513,BOOK XXIII.,The son of Nestor then took the mare and gave her over to
13514,BOOK XXIII.,"Menelaus, whose anger was thus appeased; as when dew falls upon a"
13515,BOOK XXIII.,"field of ripening corn, and the lands are bristling with the"
13516,BOOK XXIII.,"harvest—even so, O Menelaus, was your heart made glad within you."
13517,BOOK XXIII.,"He turned to Antilochus and said, “Now, Antilochus, angry though"
13518,BOOK XXIII.,"I have been, I can give way to you of my own free will; you have"
13519,BOOK XXIII.,"never been headstrong nor ill-disposed hitherto, but this time"
13520,BOOK XXIII.,your youth has got the better of your judgement; be careful how
13521,BOOK XXIII.,you outwit your betters in future; no one else could have brought
13522,BOOK XXIII.,"me round so easily, but your good father, your brother, and"
13523,BOOK XXIII.,yourself have all of you had infinite trouble on my behalf; I
13524,BOOK XXIII.,"therefore yield to your entreaty, and will give up the mare to"
13525,BOOK XXIII.,"you, mine though it indeed be; the people will thus see that I am"
13526,BOOK XXIII.,neither harsh nor vindictive.”
13527,BOOK XXIII.,
13528,BOOK XXIII.,"With this he gave the mare over to Antilochus’s comrade Noemon,"
13529,BOOK XXIII.,"and then took the cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth,"
13530,BOOK XXIII.,"carried off the two talents of gold, and the fifth prize, the"
13531,BOOK XXIII.,"two-handled urn, being unawarded, Achilles gave it to Nestor,"
13532,BOOK XXIII.,"going up to him among the assembled Argives and saying, “Take"
13533,BOOK XXIII.,"this, my good old friend, as an heirloom and memorial of the"
13534,BOOK XXIII.,funeral of Patroclus—for you shall see him no more among the
13535,BOOK XXIII.,Argives. I give you this prize though you cannot win one; you can
13536,BOOK XXIII.,"now neither wrestle nor fight, and cannot enter for the"
13537,BOOK XXIII.,"javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand of age has been laid"
13538,BOOK XXIII.,heavily upon you.”
13539,BOOK XXIII.,
13540,BOOK XXIII.,"So saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who received it gladly"
13541,BOOK XXIII.,"and answered, “My son, all that you have said is true; there is"
13542,BOOK XXIII.,"no strength now in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my"
13543,BOOK XXIII.,hands from either shoulder. Would that I were still young and
13544,BOOK XXIII.,strong as when the Epeans were burying King Amarynceus in
13545,BOOK XXIII.,"Buprasium, and his sons offered prizes in his honour. There was"
13546,BOOK XXIII.,then none that could vie with me neither of the Epeans nor the
13547,BOOK XXIII.,Pylians themselves nor the Aetolians. In boxing I overcame
13548,BOOK XXIII.,"Clytomedes son of Enops, and in wrestling, Ancaeus of Pleuron who"
13549,BOOK XXIII.,"had come forward against me. Iphiclus was a good runner, but I"
13550,BOOK XXIII.,"beat him, and threw farther with my spear than either Phyleus or"
13551,BOOK XXIII.,Polydorus. In chariot-racing alone did the two sons of Actor
13552,BOOK XXIII.,"surpass me by crowding their horses in front of me, for they were"
13553,BOOK XXIII.,"angry at the way victory had gone, and at the greater part of the"
13554,BOOK XXIII.,prizes remaining in the place in which they had been offered.
13555,BOOK XXIII.,"They were twins, and the one kept on holding the reins, and"
13556,BOOK XXIII.,"holding the reins, while the other plied the whip. Such was I"
13557,BOOK XXIII.,"then, but now I must leave these matters to younger men; I must"
13558,BOOK XXIII.,"bow before the weight of years, but in those days I was eminent"
13559,BOOK XXIII.,"among heroes. And now, sir, go on with the funeral contests in"
13560,BOOK XXIII.,"honour of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heart"
13561,BOOK XXIII.,rejoices that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my
13562,BOOK XXIII.,"goodwill towards you, and of the respect due to me from the"
13563,BOOK XXIII.,Achaeans. For all which may the grace of heaven be vouchsafed you
13564,BOOK XXIII.,in great abundance.”
13565,BOOK XXIII.,
13566,BOOK XXIII.,"Thereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened to all the thanks"
13567,BOOK XXIII.,"of Nestor, went about among the concourse of the Achaeans, and"
13568,BOOK XXIII.,presently offered prizes for skill in the painful art of boxing.
13569,BOOK XXIII.,"He brought out a strong mule, and made it fast in the middle of"
13570,BOOK XXIII.,"the crowd—a she-mule never yet broken, but six years old—when it"
13571,BOOK XXIII.,"is hardest of all to break them: this was for the victor, and for"
13572,BOOK XXIII.,the vanquished he offered a double cup. Then he stood up and said
13573,BOOK XXIII.,"among the Argives, “Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, I"
13574,BOOK XXIII.,invite our two champion boxers to lay about them lustily and
13575,BOOK XXIII.,compete for these prizes. He to whom Apollo vouchsafes the
13576,BOOK XXIII.,"greater endurance, and whom the Achaeans acknowledge as victor,"
13577,BOOK XXIII.,"shall take the mule back with him to his own tent, while he that"
13578,BOOK XXIII.,is vanquished shall have the double cup.”
13579,BOOK XXIII.,
13580,BOOK XXIII.,As he spoke there stood up a champion both brave and of great
13581,BOOK XXIII.,"stature, a skilful boxer, Epeus, son of Panopeus. He laid his"
13582,BOOK XXIII.,"hand on the mule and said, “Let the man who is to have the cup"
13583,BOOK XXIII.,"come hither, for none but myself will take the mule. I am the"
13584,BOOK XXIII.,"best boxer of all here present, and none can beat me. Is it not"
13585,BOOK XXIII.,"enough that I should fall short of you in actual fighting? Still,"
13586,BOOK XXIII.,"no man can be good at everything. I tell you plainly, and it"
13587,BOOK XXIII.,shall come true; if any man will box with me I will bruise his
13588,BOOK XXIII.,body and break his bones; therefore let his friends stay here in
13589,BOOK XXIII.,a body and be at hand to take him away when I have done with
13590,BOOK XXIII.,him.”
13591,BOOK XXIII.,
13592,BOOK XXIII.,"They all held their peace, and no man rose save Euryalus son of"
13593,BOOK XXIII.,"Mecisteus, who was son of Talaus. Mecisteus went once to Thebes"
13594,BOOK XXIII.,"after the fall of Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all"
13595,BOOK XXIII.,"the people of Cadmus. The son of Tydeus was Euryalus’s second,"
13596,BOOK XXIII.,cheering him on and hoping heartily that he would win. First he
13597,BOOK XXIII.,put a waistband round him and then he gave him some well-cut
13598,BOOK XXIII.,thongs of ox-hide; the two men being now girt went into the
13599,BOOK XXIII.,"middle of the ring, and immediately fell to; heavily indeed did"
13600,BOOK XXIII.,they punish one another and lay about them with their brawny
13601,BOOK XXIII.,"fists. One could hear the horrid crashing of their jaws, and they"
13602,BOOK XXIII.,sweated from every pore of their skin. Presently Epeus came on
13603,BOOK XXIII.,and gave Euryalus a blow on the jaw as he was looking round;
13604,BOOK XXIII.,Euryalus could not keep his legs; they gave way under him in a
13605,BOOK XXIII.,"moment and he sprang up with a bound, as a fish leaps into the"
13606,BOOK XXIII.,"air near some shore that is all bestrewn with sea-wrack, when"
13607,BOOK XXIII.,"Boreas furs the top of the waves, and then falls back into deep"
13608,BOOK XXIII.,water. But noble Epeus caught hold of him and raised him up; his
13609,BOOK XXIII.,"comrades also came round him and led him from the ring, unsteady"
13610,BOOK XXIII.,"in his gait, his head hanging on one side, and spitting great"
13611,BOOK XXIII.,clots of gore. They set him down in a swoon and then went to
13612,BOOK XXIII.,fetch the double cup.
13613,BOOK XXIII.,
13614,BOOK XXIII.,The son of Peleus now brought out the prizes for the third
13615,BOOK XXIII.,contest and showed them to the Argives. These were for the
13616,BOOK XXIII.,painful art of wrestling. For the winner there was a great tripod
13617,BOOK XXIII.,"ready for setting upon the fire, and the Achaeans valued it among"
13618,BOOK XXIII.,themselves at twelve oxen. For the loser he brought out a woman
13619,BOOK XXIII.,"skilled in all manner of arts, and they valued her at four oxen."
13620,BOOK XXIII.,"He rose and said among the Argives, “Stand forward, you who will"
13621,BOOK XXIII.,essay this contest.”
13622,BOOK XXIII.,
13623,BOOK XXIII.,"Forthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, and crafty"
13624,BOOK XXIII.,"Ulysses, full of wiles, rose also. The two girded themselves and"
13625,BOOK XXIII.,went into the middle of the ring. They gripped each other in
13626,BOOK XXIII.,their strong hands like the rafters which some master-builder
13627,BOOK XXIII.,frames for the roof of a high house to keep the wind out. Their
13628,BOOK XXIII.,backbones cracked as they tugged at one another with their mighty
13629,BOOK XXIII.,arms—and sweat rained from them in torrents. Many a bloody weal
13630,BOOK XXIII.,"sprang up on their sides and shoulders, but they kept on striving"
13631,BOOK XXIII.,with might and main for victory and to win the tripod. Ulysses
13632,BOOK XXIII.,"could not throw Ajax, nor Ajax him; Ulysses was too strong for"
13633,BOOK XXIII.,"him; but when the Achaeans began to tire of watching them, Ajax"
13634,BOOK XXIII.,"said to Ulysses, “Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall either"
13635,BOOK XXIII.,"lift me, or I you, and let Jove settle it between us.”"
13636,BOOK XXIII.,
13637,BOOK XXIII.,"He lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but Ulysses did not"
13638,BOOK XXIII.,forget his cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his
13639,BOOK XXIII.,"knee, so that he could not keep his feet, but fell on his back"
13640,BOOK XXIII.,"with Ulysses lying upon his chest, and all who saw it marvelled."
13641,BOOK XXIII.,Then Ulysses in turn lifted Ajax and stirred him a little from
13642,BOOK XXIII.,"the ground but could not lift him right off it, his knee sank"
13643,BOOK XXIII.,"under him, and the two fell side by side on the ground and were"
13644,BOOK XXIII.,all begrimed with dust. They now sprang towards one another and
13645,BOOK XXIII.,"were for wrestling yet a third time, but Achilles rose and stayed"
13646,BOOK XXIII.,"them. “Put not each other further,” said he, “to such cruel"
13647,BOOK XXIII.,"suffering; the victory is with both alike, take each of you an"
13648,BOOK XXIII.,"equal prize, and let the other Achaeans now compete.”"
13649,BOOK XXIII.,
13650,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus did he speak and they did even as he had said, and put on"
13651,BOOK XXIII.,their shirts again after wiping the dust from off their bodies.
13652,BOOK XXIII.,
13653,BOOK XXIII.,The son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed in running—a
13654,BOOK XXIII.,"mixing-bowl beautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold"
13655,BOOK XXIII.,"six measures, and far exceeded all others in the whole world for"
13656,BOOK XXIII.,"beauty; it was the work of cunning artificers in Sidon, and had"
13657,BOOK XXIII.,"been brought into port by Phoenicians from beyond the sea, who"
13658,BOOK XXIII.,had made a present of it to Thoas. Eueneus son of Jason had given
13659,BOOK XXIII.,"it to Patroclus in ransom of Priam’s son Lycaon, and Achilles now"
13660,BOOK XXIII.,offered it as a prize in honour of his comrade to him who should
13661,BOOK XXIII.,be the swiftest runner. For the second prize he offered a large
13662,BOOK XXIII.,"ox, well fattened, while for the last there was to be half a"
13663,BOOK XXIII.,"talent of gold. He then rose and said among the Argives, “Stand"
13664,BOOK XXIII.,"forward, you who will essay this contest.”"
13665,BOOK XXIII.,
13666,BOOK XXIII.,"Forthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with cunning Ulysses,"
13667,BOOK XXIII.,"and Nestor’s son Antilochus, the fastest runner among all the"
13668,BOOK XXIII.,youth of his time. They stood side by side and Achilles showed
13669,BOOK XXIII.,them the goal. The course was set out for them from the
13670,BOOK XXIII.,"starting-post, and the son of Oileus took the lead at once, with"
13671,BOOK XXIII.,Ulysses as close behind him as the shuttle is to a woman’s bosom
13672,BOOK XXIII.,when she throws the woof across the warp and holds it close up to
13673,BOOK XXIII.,her; even so close behind him was Ulysses—treading in his
13674,BOOK XXIII.,"footprints before the dust could settle there, and Ajax could"
13675,BOOK XXIII.,feel his breath on the back of his head as he ran swiftly on. The
13676,BOOK XXIII.,Achaeans all shouted applause as they saw him straining his
13677,BOOK XXIII.,"utmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when they were"
13678,BOOK XXIII.,now nearing the end of the course Ulysses prayed inwardly to
13679,BOOK XXIII.,"Minerva. “Hear me,” he cried, “and help my feet, O goddess.” Thus"
13680,BOOK XXIII.,"did he pray, and Pallas Minerva heard his prayer; she made his"
13681,BOOK XXIII.,"hands and his feet feel light, and when the runners were at the"
13682,BOOK XXIII.,"point of pouncing upon the prize, Ajax, through Minerva’s spite"
13683,BOOK XXIII.,slipped upon some offal that was lying there from the cattle
13684,BOOK XXIII.,"which Achilles had slaughtered in honour of Patroclus, and his"
13685,BOOK XXIII.,mouth and nostrils were all filled with cow dung. Ulysses
13686,BOOK XXIII.,"therefore carried off the mixing-bowl, for he got before Ajax and"
13687,BOOK XXIII.,came in first. But Ajax took the ox and stood with his hand on
13688,BOOK XXIII.,"one of its horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth. Then he"
13689,BOOK XXIII.,"said to the Argives, “Alas, the goddess has spoiled my running;"
13690,BOOK XXIII.,she watches over Ulysses and stands by him as though she were his
13691,BOOK XXIII.,own mother.” Thus did he speak and they all of them laughed
13692,BOOK XXIII.,heartily.
13693,BOOK XXIII.,
13694,BOOK XXIII.,Antilochus carried off the last prize and smiled as he said to
13695,BOOK XXIII.,"the bystanders, “You all see, my friends, that now too the gods"
13696,BOOK XXIII.,have shown their respect for seniority. Ajax is somewhat older
13697,BOOK XXIII.,"than I am, and as for Ulysses, he belongs to an earlier"
13698,BOOK XXIII.,"generation, but he is hale in spite of his years, and no man of"
13699,BOOK XXIII.,the Achaeans can run against him save only Achilles.”
13700,BOOK XXIII.,
13701,BOOK XXIII.,"He said this to pay a compliment to the son of Peleus, and"
13702,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles answered, “Antilochus, you shall not have praised me to"
13703,BOOK XXIII.,no purpose; I shall give you an additional half talent of gold.”
13704,BOOK XXIII.,"He then gave the half talent to Antilochus, who received it"
13705,BOOK XXIII.,gladly.
13706,BOOK XXIII.,
13707,BOOK XXIII.,"Then the son of Peleus brought out the spear, helmet and shield"
13708,BOOK XXIII.,"that had been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by"
13709,BOOK XXIII.,"Patroclus. He stood up and said among the Argives, “We bid two"
13710,BOOK XXIII.,"champions put on their armour, take their keen blades, and make"
13711,BOOK XXIII.,trial of one another in the presence of the multitude; whichever
13712,BOOK XXIII.,"of them can first wound the flesh of the other, cut through his"
13713,BOOK XXIII.,"armour, and draw blood, to him will I give this goodly Thracian"
13714,BOOK XXIII.,"sword inlaid with silver, which I took from Asteropaeus, but the"
13715,BOOK XXIII.,"armour let both hold in partnership, and I will give each of them"
13716,BOOK XXIII.,a hearty meal in my own tent.”
13717,BOOK XXIII.,
13718,BOOK XXIII.,"Forthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon, as also mighty"
13719,BOOK XXIII.,Diomed son of Tydeus. When they had put on their armour each on
13720,BOOK XXIII.,"his own side of the ring, they both went into the middle eager to"
13721,BOOK XXIII.,"engage, and with fire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans"
13722,BOOK XXIII.,"marvelled as they beheld them, and when the two were now close up"
13723,BOOK XXIII.,"with one another, thrice did they spring forward and thrice try"
13724,BOOK XXIII.,to strike each other in close combat. Ajax pierced Diomed’s round
13725,BOOK XXIII.,"shield, but did not draw blood, for the cuirass beneath the"
13726,BOOK XXIII.,shield protected him; thereon the son of Tydeus from over his
13727,BOOK XXIII.,huge shield kept aiming continually at Ajax’s neck with the point
13728,BOOK XXIII.,"of his spear, and the Achaeans alarmed for his safety bade them"
13729,BOOK XXIII.,leave off fighting and divide the prize between them. Achilles
13730,BOOK XXIII.,"then gave the great sword to the son of Tydeus, with its"
13731,BOOK XXIII.,"scabbard, and the leathern belt with which to hang it."
13732,BOOK XXIII.,
13733,BOOK XXIII.,Achilles next offered the massive iron quoit which mighty Eetion
13734,BOOK XXIII.,"had erewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles had slain him and"
13735,BOOK XXIII.,carried it off in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up
13736,BOOK XXIII.,"and said among the Argives, “Stand forward, you who would essay"
13737,BOOK XXIII.,this contest. He who wins it will have a store of iron that will
13738,BOOK XXIII.,"last him five years as they go rolling round, and if his fair"
13739,BOOK XXIII.,fields lie far from a town his shepherd or ploughman will not
13740,BOOK XXIII.,"have to make a journey to buy iron, for he will have a stock of"
13741,BOOK XXIII.,it on his own premises.”
13742,BOOK XXIII.,
13743,BOOK XXIII.,"Then uprose the two mighty men Polypoetes and Leonteus, with Ajax"
13744,BOOK XXIII.,son of Telamon and noble Epeus. They stood up one after the other
13745,BOOK XXIII.,"and Epeus took the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him,"
13746,BOOK XXIII.,which set all the Achaeans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of
13747,BOOK XXIII.,"the race of Mars. Ajax son of Telamon threw third, and sent the"
13748,BOOK XXIII.,"quoit beyond any mark that had been made yet, but when mighty"
13749,BOOK XXIII.,Polypoetes took the quoit he hurled it as though it had been a
13750,BOOK XXIII.,stockman’s stick which he sends flying about among his cattle
13751,BOOK XXIII.,"when he is driving them, so far did his throw out-distance those"
13752,BOOK XXIII.,"of the others. All who saw it roared applause, and his comrades"
13753,BOOK XXIII.,carried the prize for him and set it on board his ship.
13754,BOOK XXIII.,
13755,BOOK XXIII.,Achilles next offered a prize of iron for archery—ten
13756,BOOK XXIII.,double-edged axes and ten with single edges: he set up a ship’s
13757,BOOK XXIII.,"mast, some way off upon the sands, and with a fine string tied a"
13758,BOOK XXIII.,pigeon to it by the foot; this was what they were to aim at.
13759,BOOK XXIII.,"“Whoever,” he said, “can hit the pigeon shall have all the axes"
13760,BOOK XXIII.,and take them away with him; he who hits the string without
13761,BOOK XXIII.,hitting the bird will have taken a worse aim and shall have the
13762,BOOK XXIII.,single-edged axes.”
13763,BOOK XXIII.,
13764,BOOK XXIII.,"Then uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the stalwart squire of"
13765,BOOK XXIII.,"Idomeneus rose also, They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the"
13766,BOOK XXIII.,"lot of Teucer fell first. He let fly with his arrow forthwith,"
13767,BOOK XXIII.,but he did not promise hecatombs of firstling lambs to King
13768,BOOK XXIII.,"Apollo, and missed his bird, for Apollo foiled his aim; but he"
13769,BOOK XXIII.,"hit the string with which the bird was tied, near its foot; the"
13770,BOOK XXIII.,arrow cut the string clean through so that it hung down towards
13771,BOOK XXIII.,"the ground, while the bird flew up into the sky, and the Achaeans"
13772,BOOK XXIII.,"shouted applause. Meriones, who had his arrow ready while Teucer"
13773,BOOK XXIII.,"was aiming, snatched the bow out of his hand, and at once"
13774,BOOK XXIII.,promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling lambs to
13775,BOOK XXIII.,Apollo lord of the bow; then espying the pigeon high up under the
13776,BOOK XXIII.,"clouds, he hit her in the middle of the wing as she was circling"
13777,BOOK XXIII.,upwards; the arrow went clean through the wing and fixed itself
13778,BOOK XXIII.,"in the ground at Meriones’ feet, but the bird perched on the"
13779,BOOK XXIII.,ship’s mast hanging her head and with all her feathers drooping;
13780,BOOK XXIII.,"the life went out of her, and she fell heavily from the mast."
13781,BOOK XXIII.,"Meriones, therefore, took all ten double-edged axes, while Teucer"
13782,BOOK XXIII.,bore off the single-edged ones to his ships.
13783,BOOK XXIII.,
13784,BOOK XXIII.,Then the son of Peleus brought in a spear and a cauldron that had
13785,BOOK XXIII.,"never been on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a"
13786,BOOK XXIII.,pattern of flowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up—to
13787,BOOK XXIII.,"wit the son of Atreus, king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones,"
13788,BOOK XXIII.,"stalwart squire of Idomeneus. But Achilles spoke saying, “Son of"
13789,BOOK XXIII.,"Atreus, we know how far you excel all others both in power and in"
13790,BOOK XXIII.,throwing the javelin; take the cauldron back with you to your
13791,BOOK XXIII.,"ships, but if it so please you, let us give the spear to"
13792,BOOK XXIII.,Meriones; this at least is what I should myself wish.”
13793,BOOK XXIII.,
13794,BOOK XXIII.,"King Agamemnon assented. So he gave the bronze spear to Meriones,"
13795,BOOK XXIII.,and handed the goodly cauldron to Talthybius his esquire.

13803,BOOK XXIV.,Priam ransoms the body of Hector—Hector’s funeral.
13804,BOOK XXIV.,
13805,BOOK XXIV.,The assembly now broke up and the people went their ways each to
13806,BOOK XXIV.,"his own ship. There they made ready their supper, and then"
13807,BOOK XXIV.,bethought them of the blessed boon of sleep; but Achilles still
13808,BOOK XXIV.,"wept for thinking of his dear comrade, and sleep, before whom all"
13809,BOOK XXIV.,"things bow, could take no hold upon him. This way and that did he"
13810,BOOK XXIV.,turn as he yearned after the might and manfulness of Patroclus;
13811,BOOK XXIV.,"he thought of all they had done together, and all they had gone"
13812,BOOK XXIV.,through both on the field of battle and on the waves of the weary
13813,BOOK XXIV.,sea. As he dwelt on these things he wept bitterly and lay now on
13814,BOOK XXIV.,"his side, now on his back, and now face downwards, till at last"
13815,BOOK XXIV.,he rose and went out as one distraught to wander upon the
13816,BOOK XXIV.,"sea-shore. Then, when he saw dawn breaking over beach and sea, he"
13817,BOOK XXIV.,"yoked his horses to his chariot, and bound the body of Hector"
13818,BOOK XXIV.,behind it that he might drag it about. Thrice did he drag it
13819,BOOK XXIV.,"round the tomb of the son of Menoetius, and then went back into"
13820,BOOK XXIV.,"his tent, leaving the body on the ground full length and with its"
13821,BOOK XXIV.,"face downwards. But Apollo would not suffer it to be disfigured,"
13822,BOOK XXIV.,"for he pitied the man, dead though he now was; therefore he"
13823,BOOK XXIV.,"shielded him with his golden aegis continually, that he might"
13824,BOOK XXIV.,take no hurt while Achilles was dragging him.
13825,BOOK XXIV.,
13826,BOOK XXIV.,Thus shamefully did Achilles in his fury dishonour Hector; but
13827,BOOK XXIV.,"the blessed gods looked down in pity from heaven, and urged"
13828,BOOK XXIV.,"Mercury, slayer of Argus, to steal the body. All were of this"
13829,BOOK XXIV.,"mind save only Juno, Neptune, and Jove’s grey-eyed daughter, who"
13830,BOOK XXIV.,persisted in the hate which they had ever borne towards Ilius
13831,BOOK XXIV.,with Priam and his people; for they forgave not the wrong done
13832,BOOK XXIV.,them by Alexandrus in disdaining the goddesses who came to him
13833,BOOK XXIV.,"when he was in his sheepyards, and preferring her who had offered"
13834,BOOK XXIV.,him a wanton to his ruin.
13835,BOOK XXIV.,
13836,BOOK XXIV.,"When, therefore, the morning of the twelfth day had now come,"
13837,BOOK XXIV.,"Phoebus Apollo spoke among the immortals saying, “You gods ought"
13838,BOOK XXIV.,to be ashamed of yourselves; you are cruel and hard-hearted. Did
13839,BOOK XXIV.,not Hector burn you thigh-bones of heifers and of unblemished
13840,BOOK XXIV.,"goats? And now dare you not rescue even his dead body, for his"
13841,BOOK XXIV.,"wife to look upon, with his mother and child, his father Priam,"
13842,BOOK XXIV.,"and his people, who would forthwith commit him to the flames, and"
13843,BOOK XXIV.,"give him his due funeral rites? So, then, you would all be on the"
13844,BOOK XXIV.,"side of mad Achilles, who knows neither right nor ruth? He is"
13845,BOOK XXIV.,like some savage lion that in the pride of his great strength and
13846,BOOK XXIV.,daring springs upon men’s flocks and gorges on them. Even so has
13847,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles flung aside all pity, and all that conscience which at"
13848,BOOK XXIV.,once so greatly banes yet greatly boons him that will heed it. A
13849,BOOK XXIV.,"man may lose one far dearer than Achilles has lost—a son, it may"
13850,BOOK XXIV.,"be, or a brother born from his own mother’s womb; yet when he has"
13851,BOOK XXIV.,"mourned him and wept over him he will let him bide, for it takes"
13852,BOOK XXIV.,"much sorrow to kill a man; whereas Achilles, now that he has"
13853,BOOK XXIV.,"slain noble Hector, drags him behind his chariot round the tomb"
13854,BOOK XXIV.,"of his comrade. It were better of him, and for him, that he"
13855,BOOK XXIV.,"should not do so, for brave though he be we gods may take it ill"
13856,BOOK XXIV.,that he should vent his fury upon dead clay.”
13857,BOOK XXIV.,
13858,BOOK XXIV.,"Juno spoke up in a rage. “This were well,” she cried, “O lord of"
13859,BOOK XXIV.,"the silver bow, if you would give like honour to Hector and to"
13860,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles; but Hector was mortal and suckled at a woman’s breast,"
13861,BOOK XXIV.,whereas Achilles is the offspring of a goddess whom I myself
13862,BOOK XXIV.,"reared and brought up. I married her to Peleus, who is above"
13863,BOOK XXIV.,measure dear to the immortals; you gods came all of you to her
13864,BOOK XXIV.,wedding; you feasted along with them yourself and brought your
13865,BOOK XXIV.,"lyre—false, and fond of low company, that you have ever been.”"
13866,BOOK XXIV.,
13867,BOOK XXIV.,"Then said Jove, “Juno, be not so bitter. Their honour shall not"
13868,BOOK XXIV.,"be equal, but of all that dwell in Ilius, Hector was dearest to"
13869,BOOK XXIV.,"the gods, as also to myself, for his offerings never failed me."
13870,BOOK XXIV.,"Never was my altar stinted of its dues, nor of the"
13871,BOOK XXIV.,drink-offerings and savour of sacrifice which we claim of right.
13872,BOOK XXIV.,I shall therefore permit the body of mighty Hector to be stolen;
13873,BOOK XXIV.,"and yet this may hardly be without Achilles coming to know it,"
13874,BOOK XXIV.,for his mother keeps night and day beside him. Let some one of
13875,BOOK XXIV.,"you, therefore, send Thetis to me, and I will impart my counsel"
13876,BOOK XXIV.,"to her, namely that Achilles is to accept a ransom from Priam,"
13877,BOOK XXIV.,and give up the body.”

13880,BOOK XXIV.,Down she plunged into the dark sea midway between Samos and rocky
13881,BOOK XXIV.,"Imbrus; the waters hissed as they closed over her, and she sank"
13882,BOOK XXIV.,"into the bottom as the lead at the end of an ox-horn, that is"
13883,BOOK XXIV.,sped to carry death to fishes. She found Thetis sitting in a
13884,BOOK XXIV.,great cave with the other sea-goddesses gathered round her; there
13885,BOOK XXIV.,she sat in the midst of them weeping for her noble son who was to
13886,BOOK XXIV.,"fall far from his own land, on the rich plains of Troy. Iris went"
13887,BOOK XXIV.,"up to her and said, “Rise Thetis; Jove, whose counsels fail not,"
13888,BOOK XXIV.,"bids you come to him.” And Thetis answered, “Why does the mighty"
13889,BOOK XXIV.,"god so bid me? I am in great grief, and shrink from going in and"
13890,BOOK XXIV.,"out among the immortals. Still, I will go, and the word that he"
13891,BOOK XXIV.,may speak shall not be spoken in vain.”
13892,BOOK XXIV.,
13893,BOOK XXIV.,"The goddess took her dark veil, than which there can be no robe"
13894,BOOK XXIV.,"more sombre, and went forth with fleet Iris leading the way"
13895,BOOK XXIV.,"before her. The waves of the sea opened them a path, and when"
13896,BOOK XXIV.,"they reached the shore they flew up into the heavens, where they"
13897,BOOK XXIV.,found the all-seeing son of Saturn with the blessed gods that
13898,BOOK XXIV.,live for ever assembled near him. Minerva gave up her seat to
13899,BOOK XXIV.,"her, and she sat down by the side of father Jove. Juno then"
13900,BOOK XXIV.,"placed a fair golden cup in her hand, and spoke to her in words"
13901,BOOK XXIV.,"of comfort, whereon Thetis drank and gave her back the cup; and"
13902,BOOK XXIV.,the sire of gods and men was the first to speak.
13903,BOOK XXIV.,
13904,BOOK XXIV.,"“So, goddess,” said he, “for all your sorrow, and the grief that"
13905,BOOK XXIV.,"I well know reigns ever in your heart, you have come hither to"
13906,BOOK XXIV.,"Olympus, and I will tell you why I have sent for you. This nine"
13907,BOOK XXIV.,days past the immortals have been quarrelling about Achilles
13908,BOOK XXIV.,waster of cities and the body of Hector. The gods would have
13909,BOOK XXIV.,"Mercury slayer of Argus steal the body, but in furtherance of our"
13910,BOOK XXIV.,"peace and amity henceforward, I will concede such honour to your"
13911,BOOK XXIV.,"son as I will now tell you. Go, then, to the host and lay these"
13912,BOOK XXIV.,"commands upon him; say that the gods are angry with him, and that"
13913,BOOK XXIV.,"I am myself more angry than them all, in that he keeps Hector at"
13914,BOOK XXIV.,the ships and will not give him up. He may thus fear me and let
13915,BOOK XXIV.,the body go. At the same time I will send Iris to great Priam to
13916,BOOK XXIV.,"bid him go to the ships of the Achaeans, and ransom his son,"
13917,BOOK XXIV.,taking with him such gifts for Achilles as may give him
13918,BOOK XXIV.,satisfaction.”
13919,BOOK XXIV.,
13920,BOOK XXIV.,"Silver-footed Thetis did as the god had told her, and forthwith"
13921,BOOK XXIV.,down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus. She went to
13922,BOOK XXIV.,"her son’s tents where she found him grieving bitterly, while his"
13923,BOOK XXIV.,"trusty comrades round him were busy preparing their morning meal,"
13924,BOOK XXIV.,for which they had killed a great woolly sheep. His mother sat
13925,BOOK XXIV.,"down beside him and caressed him with her hand saying, “My son,"
13926,BOOK XXIV.,how long will you keep on thus grieving and making moan? You are
13927,BOOK XXIV.,"gnawing at your own heart, and think neither of food nor of"
13928,BOOK XXIV.,"woman’s embraces; and yet these too were well, for you have no"
13929,BOOK XXIV.,"long time to live, and death with the strong hand of fate are"
13930,BOOK XXIV.,"already close beside you. Now, therefore, heed what I say, for I"
13931,BOOK XXIV.,come as a messenger from Jove; he says that the gods are angry
13932,BOOK XXIV.,"with you, and himself more angry than them all, in that you keep"
13933,BOOK XXIV.,Hector at the ships and will not give him up. Therefore let him
13934,BOOK XXIV.,"go, and accept a ransom for his body.”"
13935,BOOK XXIV.,
13936,BOOK XXIV.,"And Achilles answered, “So be it. If Olympian Jove of his own"
13937,BOOK XXIV.,"motion thus commands me, let him that brings the ransom bear the"
13938,BOOK XXIV.,body away.”
13939,BOOK XXIV.,
13940,BOOK XXIV.,Thus did mother and son talk together at the ships in long
13941,BOOK XXIV.,discourse with one another. Meanwhile the son of Saturn sent Iris
13942,BOOK XXIV.,"to the strong city of Ilius. “Go,” said he, “fleet Iris, from the"
13943,BOOK XXIV.,"mansions of Olympus, and tell King Priam in Ilius, that he is to"
13944,BOOK XXIV.,go to the ships of the Achaeans and free the body of his dear
13945,BOOK XXIV.,son. He is to take such gifts with him as shall give satisfaction
13946,BOOK XXIV.,"to Achilles, and he is to go alone, with no other Trojan, save"
13947,BOOK XXIV.,"only some honoured servant who may drive his mules and waggon,"
13948,BOOK XXIV.,and bring back the body of him whom noble Achilles has slain. Let
13949,BOOK XXIV.,"him have no thought nor fear of death in his heart, for we will"
13950,BOOK XXIV.,"send the slayer of Argus to escort him, and bring him within the"
13951,BOOK XXIV.,tent of Achilles. Achilles will not kill him nor let another do
13952,BOOK XXIV.,"so, for he will take heed to his ways and sin not, and he will"
13953,BOOK XXIV.,entreat a suppliant with all honourable courtesy.”
13954,BOOK XXIV.,
13955,BOOK XXIV.,"On this Iris, fleet as the wind, sped forth to deliver her"
13956,BOOK XXIV.,"message. She went to Priam’s house, and found weeping and"
13957,BOOK XXIV.,lamentation therein. His sons were seated round their father in
13958,BOOK XXIV.,"the outer courtyard, and their raiment was wet with tears: the"
13959,BOOK XXIV.,old man sat in the midst of them with his mantle wrapped close
13960,BOOK XXIV.,"about his body, and his head and neck all covered with the filth"
13961,BOOK XXIV.,which he had clutched as he lay grovelling in the mire. His
13962,BOOK XXIV.,"daughters and his sons’ wives went wailing about the house, as"
13963,BOOK XXIV.,"they thought of the many and brave men who lay dead, slain by the"
13964,BOOK XXIV.,Argives. The messenger of Jove stood by Priam and spoke softly to
13965,BOOK XXIV.,"him, but fear fell upon him as she did so. “Take heart,” she"
13966,BOOK XXIV.,"said, “Priam offspring of Dardanus, take heart and fear not. I"
13967,BOOK XXIV.,"bring no evil tidings, but am minded well towards you. I come as"
13968,BOOK XXIV.,"a messenger from Jove, who though he be not near, takes thought"
13969,BOOK XXIV.,for you and pities you. The lord of Olympus bids you go and
13970,BOOK XXIV.,"ransom noble Hector, and take with you such gifts as shall give"
13971,BOOK XXIV.,"satisfaction to Achilles. You are to go alone, with no Trojan,"
13972,BOOK XXIV.,save only some honoured servant who may drive your mules and
13973,BOOK XXIV.,"waggon, and bring back to the city the body of him whom noble"
13974,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles has slain. You are to have no thought, nor fear of"
13975,BOOK XXIV.,"death, for Jove will send the slayer of Argus to escort you. When"
13976,BOOK XXIV.,"he has brought you within Achilles’ tent, Achilles will not kill"
13977,BOOK XXIV.,"you nor let another do so, for he will take heed to his ways and"
13978,BOOK XXIV.,"sin not, and he will entreat a suppliant with all honourable"
13979,BOOK XXIV.,courtesy.”
13980,BOOK XXIV.,
13981,BOOK XXIV.,"Iris went her way when she had thus spoken, and Priam told his"
13982,BOOK XXIV.,"sons to get a mule-waggon ready, and to make the body of the"
13983,BOOK XXIV.,waggon fast upon the top of its bed. Then he went down into his
13984,BOOK XXIV.,"fragrant store-room, high-vaulted, and made of cedar-wood, where"
13985,BOOK XXIV.,"his many treasures were kept, and he called Hecuba his wife."
13986,BOOK XXIV.,"“Wife,” said he, “a messenger has come to me from Olympus, and"
13987,BOOK XXIV.,has told me to go to the ships of the Achaeans to ransom my dear
13988,BOOK XXIV.,"son, taking with me such gifts as shall give satisfaction to"
13989,BOOK XXIV.,Achilles. What think you of this matter? for my own part I am
13990,BOOK XXIV.,greatly moved to pass through the camps of the Achaeans and go to
13991,BOOK XXIV.,their ships.”
13992,BOOK XXIV.,
13993,BOOK XXIV.,"His wife cried aloud as she heard him, and said, “Alas, what has"
13994,BOOK XXIV.,become of that judgement for which you have been ever famous both
13995,BOOK XXIV.,among strangers and your own people? How can you venture alone to
13996,BOOK XXIV.,"the ships of the Achaeans, and look into the face of him who has"
13997,BOOK XXIV.,"slain so many of your brave sons? You must have iron courage, for"
13998,BOOK XXIV.,"if the cruel savage sees you and lays hold on you, he will know"
13999,BOOK XXIV.,neither respect nor pity. Let us then weep Hector from afar here
14000,BOOK XXIV.,"in our own house, for when I gave him birth the threads of"
14001,BOOK XXIV.,overruling fate were spun for him that dogs should eat his flesh
14002,BOOK XXIV.,"far from his parents, in the house of that terrible man on whose"
14003,BOOK XXIV.,liver I would fain fasten and devour it. Thus would I avenge my
14004,BOOK XXIV.,"son, who showed no cowardice when Achilles slew him, and thought"
14005,BOOK XXIV.,neither of flight nor of avoiding battle as he stood in defence
14006,BOOK XXIV.,of Trojan men and Trojan women.”
14007,BOOK XXIV.,
14008,BOOK XXIV.,"Then Priam said, “I would go, do not therefore stay me nor be as"
14009,BOOK XXIV.,"a bird of ill omen in my house, for you will not move me. Had it"
14010,BOOK XXIV.,been some mortal man who had sent me some prophet or priest who
14011,BOOK XXIV.,divines from sacrifice—I should have deemed him false and have
14012,BOOK XXIV.,given him no heed; but now I have heard the goddess and seen her
14013,BOOK XXIV.,"face to face, therefore I will go and her saying shall not be in"
14014,BOOK XXIV.,vain. If it be my fate to die at the ships of the Achaeans even
14015,BOOK XXIV.,"so would I have it; let Achilles slay me, if I may but first have"
14016,BOOK XXIV.,taken my son in my arms and mourned him to my heart’s
14017,BOOK XXIV.,comforting.”
14018,BOOK XXIV.,
14019,BOOK XXIV.,"So saying he lifted the lids of his chests, and took out twelve"
14020,BOOK XXIV.,"goodly vestments. He took also twelve cloaks of single fold,"
14021,BOOK XXIV.,"twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal number of shirts."
14022,BOOK XXIV.,"He weighed out ten talents of gold, and brought moreover two"
14023,BOOK XXIV.,"burnished tripods, four cauldrons, and a very beautiful cup which"
14024,BOOK XXIV.,the Thracians had given him when he had gone to them on an
14025,BOOK XXIV.,"embassy; it was very precious, but he grudged not even this, so"
14026,BOOK XXIV.,eager was he to ransom the body of his son. Then he chased all
14027,BOOK XXIV.,the Trojans from the court and rebuked them with words of anger.
14028,BOOK XXIV.,"“Out,” he cried, “shame and disgrace to me that you are. Have you"
14029,BOOK XXIV.,no grief in your own homes that you are come to plague me here?
14030,BOOK XXIV.,"Is it a small thing, think you, that the son of Saturn has sent"
14031,BOOK XXIV.,"this sorrow upon me, to lose the bravest of my sons? Nay, you"
14032,BOOK XXIV.,"shall prove it in person, for now he is gone the Achaeans will"
14033,BOOK XXIV.,"have easier work in killing you. As for me, let me go down within"
14034,BOOK XXIV.,"the house of Hades, ere mine eyes behold the sacking and wasting"
14035,BOOK XXIV.,of the city.”
14036,BOOK XXIV.,
14037,BOOK XXIV.,"He drove the men away with his staff, and they went forth as the"
14038,BOOK XXIV.,"old man sped them. Then he called to his sons, upbraiding"
14039,BOOK XXIV.,"Helenus, Paris, noble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites of the"
14040,BOOK XXIV.,"loud battle-cry, Deiphobus, Hippothous, and Dius. These nine did"
14041,BOOK XXIV.,"the old man call near him. “Come to me at once,” he cried,"
14042,BOOK XXIV.,“worthless sons who do me shame; would that you had all been
14043,BOOK XXIV.,"killed at the ships rather than Hector. Miserable man that I am,"
14044,BOOK XXIV.,"I have had the bravest sons in all Troy—noble Nestor, Troilus the"
14045,BOOK XXIV.,"dauntless charioteer, and Hector who was a god among men, so that"
14046,BOOK XXIV.,one would have thought he was son to an immortal—yet there is not
14047,BOOK XXIV.,one of them left. Mars has slain them and those of whom I am
14048,BOOK XXIV.,"ashamed are alone left me. Liars, and light of foot, heroes of"
14049,BOOK XXIV.,"the dance, robbers of lambs and kids from your own people, why do"
14050,BOOK XXIV.,"you not get a waggon ready for me at once, and put all these"
14051,BOOK XXIV.,things upon it that I may set out on my way?”
14052,BOOK XXIV.,
14053,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus did he speak, and they feared the rebuke of their father."
14054,BOOK XXIV.,"They brought out a strong mule-waggon, newly made, and set the"
14055,BOOK XXIV.,body of the waggon fast on its bed. They took the mule-yoke from
14056,BOOK XXIV.,"the peg on which it hung, a yoke of boxwood with a knob on the"
14057,BOOK XXIV.,top of it and rings for the reins to go through. Then they
14058,BOOK XXIV.,"brought a yoke-band eleven cubits long, to bind the yoke to the"
14059,BOOK XXIV.,"pole; they bound it on at the far end of the pole, and put the"
14060,BOOK XXIV.,ring over the upright pin making it fast with three turns of the
14061,BOOK XXIV.,"band on either side the knob, and bending the thong of the yoke"
14062,BOOK XXIV.,"beneath it. This done, they brought from the store-chamber the"
14063,BOOK XXIV.,"rich ransom that was to purchase the body of Hector, and they set"
14064,BOOK XXIV.,it all orderly on the waggon; then they yoked the strong
14065,BOOK XXIV.,harness-mules which the Mysians had on a time given as a goodly
14066,BOOK XXIV.,present to Priam; but for Priam himself they yoked horses which
14067,BOOK XXIV.,"the old king had bred, and kept for his own use."
14068,BOOK XXIV.,
14069,BOOK XXIV.,Thus heedfully did Priam and his servant see to the yolking of
14070,BOOK XXIV.,"their cars at the palace. Then Hecuba came to them all sorrowful,"
14071,BOOK XXIV.,"with a golden goblet of wine in her right hand, that they might"
14072,BOOK XXIV.,make a drink-offering before they set out. She stood in front of
14073,BOOK XXIV.,"the horses and said, “Take this, make a drink-offering to father"
14074,BOOK XXIV.,"Jove, and since you are minded to go to the ships in spite of me,"
14075,BOOK XXIV.,pray that you may come safely back from the hands of your
14076,BOOK XXIV.,"enemies. Pray to the son of Saturn lord of the whirlwind, who"
14077,BOOK XXIV.,"sits on Ida and looks down over all Troy, pray him to send his"
14078,BOOK XXIV.,"swift messenger on your right hand, the bird of omen which is"
14079,BOOK XXIV.,"strongest and most dear to him of all birds, that you may see it"
14080,BOOK XXIV.,with your own eyes and trust it as you go forth to the ships of
14081,BOOK XXIV.,"the Danaans. If all-seeing Jove will not send you this messenger,"
14082,BOOK XXIV.,"however set upon it you may be, I would not have you go to the"
14083,BOOK XXIV.,ships of the Argives.”
14084,BOOK XXIV.,
14085,BOOK XXIV.,"And Priam answered, “Wife, I will do as you desire me; it is well"
14086,BOOK XXIV.,"to lift hands in prayer to Jove, if so be he may have mercy upon"
14087,BOOK XXIV.,me.”
14088,BOOK XXIV.,
14089,BOOK XXIV.,With this the old man bade the serving-woman pour pure water over
14090,BOOK XXIV.,"his hands, and the woman came, bearing the water in a bowl. He"
14091,BOOK XXIV.,washed his hands and took the cup from his wife; then he made the
14092,BOOK XXIV.,"drink-offering and prayed, standing in the middle of the"
14093,BOOK XXIV.,"courtyard and turning his eyes to heaven. “Father Jove,” he said,"
14094,BOOK XXIV.,"“that rulest from Ida, most glorious and most great, grant that I"
14095,BOOK XXIV.,may be received kindly and compassionately in the tents of
14096,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles; and send your swift messenger upon my right hand, the"
14097,BOOK XXIV.,bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to you of all
14098,BOOK XXIV.,"birds, that I may see it with my own eyes and trust it as I go"
14099,BOOK XXIV.,forth to the ships of the Danaans.”
14100,BOOK XXIV.,
14101,BOOK XXIV.,"So did he pray, and Jove the lord of counsel heard his prayer."
14102,BOOK XXIV.,"Forthwith he sent an eagle, the most unerring portent of all"
14103,BOOK XXIV.,"birds that fly, the dusky hunter that men also call the Black"
14104,BOOK XXIV.,Eagle. His wings were spread abroad on either side as wide as the
14105,BOOK XXIV.,well-made and well-bolted door of a rich man’s chamber. He came
14106,BOOK XXIV.,"to them flying over the city upon their right hands, and when"
14107,BOOK XXIV.,they saw him they were glad and their hearts took comfort within
14108,BOOK XXIV.,"them. The old man made haste to mount his chariot, and drove out"
14109,BOOK XXIV.,through the inner gateway and under the echoing gatehouse of the
14110,BOOK XXIV.,outer court. Before him went the mules drawing the four-wheeled
14111,BOOK XXIV.,"waggon, and driven by wise Idaeus; behind these were the horses,"
14112,BOOK XXIV.,which the old man lashed with his whip and drove swiftly through
14113,BOOK XXIV.,"the city, while his friends followed after, wailing and lamenting"
14114,BOOK XXIV.,for him as though he were on his road to death. As soon as they
14115,BOOK XXIV.,"had come down from the city and had reached the plain, his sons"
14116,BOOK XXIV.,and sons-in-law who had followed him went back to Ilius.
14117,BOOK XXIV.,
14118,BOOK XXIV.,But Priam and Idaeus as they showed out upon the plain did not
14119,BOOK XXIV.,"escape the ken of all-seeing Jove, who looked down upon the old"
14120,BOOK XXIV.,"man and pitied him; then he spoke to his son Mercury and said,"
14121,BOOK XXIV.,"“Mercury, for it is you who are the most disposed to escort men"
14122,BOOK XXIV.,"on their way, and to hear those whom you will hear, go, and so"
14123,BOOK XXIV.,conduct Priam to the ships of the Achaeans that no other of the
14124,BOOK XXIV.,Danaans shall see him nor take note of him until he reach the son
14125,BOOK XXIV.,of Peleus.”
14126,BOOK XXIV.,
14127,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus he spoke and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus,"
14128,BOOK XXIV.,did as he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden
14129,BOOK XXIV.,sandals with which he could fly like the wind over land and sea;
14130,BOOK XXIV.,"he took the wand with which he seals men’s eyes in sleep, or"
14131,BOOK XXIV.,"wakes them just as he pleases, and flew holding it in his hand"
14132,BOOK XXIV.,"till he came to Troy and to the Hellespont. To look at, he was"
14133,BOOK XXIV.,like a young man of noble birth in the hey-day of his youth and
14134,BOOK XXIV.,beauty with the down just coming upon his face.
14135,BOOK XXIV.,
14136,BOOK XXIV.,Now when Priam and Idaeus had driven past the great tomb of
14137,BOOK XXIV.,"Ilius, they stayed their mules and horses that they might drink"
14138,BOOK XXIV.,"in the river, for the shades of night were falling, when,"
14139,BOOK XXIV.,"therefore, Idaeus saw Mercury standing near them he said to"
14140,BOOK XXIV.,"Priam, “Take heed, descendant of Dardanus; here is matter which"
14141,BOOK XXIV.,demands consideration. I see a man who I think will presently
14142,BOOK XXIV.,"fall upon us; let us fly with our horses, or at least embrace his"
14143,BOOK XXIV.,knees and implore him to take compassion upon us?”
14144,BOOK XXIV.,
14145,BOOK XXIV.,"When he heard this the old man’s heart failed him, and he was in"
14146,BOOK XXIV.,"great fear; he stayed where he was as one dazed, and the hair"
14147,BOOK XXIV.,stood on end over his whole body; but the bringer of good luck
14148,BOOK XXIV.,"came up to him and took him by the hand, saying, “Whither,"
14149,BOOK XXIV.,"father, are you thus driving your mules and horses in the dead of"
14150,BOOK XXIV.,night when other men are asleep? Are you not afraid of the fierce
14151,BOOK XXIV.,"Achaeans who are hard by you, so cruel and relentless? Should"
14152,BOOK XXIV.,some one of them see you bearing so much treasure through the
14153,BOOK XXIV.,"darkness of the flying night, what would not your state then be?"
14154,BOOK XXIV.,"You are no longer young, and he who is with you is too old to"
14155,BOOK XXIV.,"protect you from those who would attack you. For myself, I will"
14156,BOOK XXIV.,"do you no harm, and I will defend you from any one else, for you"
14157,BOOK XXIV.,remind me of my own father.”
14158,BOOK XXIV.,
14159,BOOK XXIV.,"And Priam answered, “It is indeed as you say, my dear son;"
14160,BOOK XXIV.,"nevertheless some god has held his hand over me, in that he has"
14161,BOOK XXIV.,sent such a wayfarer as yourself to meet me so opportunely; you
14162,BOOK XXIV.,"are so comely in mien and figure, and your judgement is so"
14163,BOOK XXIV.,excellent that you must come of blessed parents.”
14164,BOOK XXIV.,
14165,BOOK XXIV.,"Then said the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, “Sir, all that"
14166,BOOK XXIV.,"you have said is right; but tell me and tell me true, are you"
14167,BOOK XXIV.,taking this rich treasure to send it to a foreign people where it
14168,BOOK XXIV.,"may be safe, or are you all leaving strong Ilius in dismay now"
14169,BOOK XXIV.,that your son has fallen who was the bravest man among you and
14170,BOOK XXIV.,was never lacking in battle with the Achaeans?”
14171,BOOK XXIV.,
14172,BOOK XXIV.,"And Priam said, “Who are you, my friend, and who are your"
14173,BOOK XXIV.,"parents, that you speak so truly about the fate of my unhappy"
14174,BOOK XXIV.,son?”
14175,BOOK XXIV.,
14176,BOOK XXIV.,"The slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, answered him, “Sir, you"
14177,BOOK XXIV.,"would prove me, that you question me about noble Hector. Many a"
14178,BOOK XXIV.,time have I set eyes upon him in battle when he was driving the
14179,BOOK XXIV.,Argives to their ships and putting them to the sword. We stood
14180,BOOK XXIV.,"still and marvelled, for Achilles in his anger with the son of"
14181,BOOK XXIV.,"Atreus suffered us not to fight. I am his squire, and came with"
14182,BOOK XXIV.,"him in the same ship. I am a Myrmidon, and my father’s name is"
14183,BOOK XXIV.,Polyctor: he is a rich man and about as old as you are; he has
14184,BOOK XXIV.,"six sons besides myself, and I am the seventh. We cast lots, and"
14185,BOOK XXIV.,it fell upon me to sail hither with Achilles. I am now come from
14186,BOOK XXIV.,"the ships on to the plain, for with daybreak the Achaeans will"
14187,BOOK XXIV.,"set battle in array about the city. They chafe at doing nothing,"
14188,BOOK XXIV.,and are so eager that their princes cannot hold them back.”
14189,BOOK XXIV.,
14190,BOOK XXIV.,"Then answered Priam, “If you are indeed the squire of Achilles"
14191,BOOK XXIV.,"son of Peleus, tell me now the whole truth. Is my son still at"
14192,BOOK XXIV.,"the ships, or has Achilles hewn him limb from limb, and given him"
14193,BOOK XXIV.,to his hounds?”
14194,BOOK XXIV.,
14195,BOOK XXIV.,"“Sir,” replied the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, “neither"
14196,BOOK XXIV.,hounds nor vultures have yet devoured him; he is still just lying
14197,BOOK XXIV.,"at the tents by the ship of Achilles, and though it is now twelve"
14198,BOOK XXIV.,"days that he has lain there, his flesh is not wasted nor have the"
14199,BOOK XXIV.,worms eaten him although they feed on warriors. At daybreak
14200,BOOK XXIV.,Achilles drags him cruelly round the sepulchre of his dear
14201,BOOK XXIV.,"comrade, but it does him no hurt. You should come yourself and"
14202,BOOK XXIV.,"see how he lies fresh as dew, with the blood all washed away, and"
14203,BOOK XXIV.,his wounds every one of them closed though many pierced him with
14204,BOOK XXIV.,their spears. Such care have the blessed gods taken of your brave
14205,BOOK XXIV.,"son, for he was dear to them beyond all measure.”"
14206,BOOK XXIV.,
14207,BOOK XXIV.,"The old man was comforted as he heard him and said, “My son, see"
14208,BOOK XXIV.,what a good thing it is to have made due offerings to the
14209,BOOK XXIV.,immortals; for as sure as that he was born my son never forgot
14210,BOOK XXIV.,"the gods that hold Olympus, and now they requite it to him even"
14211,BOOK XXIV.,in death. Accept therefore at my hands this goodly chalice; guard
14212,BOOK XXIV.,me and with heaven’s help guide me till I come to the tent of the
14213,BOOK XXIV.,son of Peleus.”
14214,BOOK XXIV.,
14215,BOOK XXIV.,"Then answered the slayer of Argus, guide and guardian, “Sir, you"
14216,BOOK XXIV.,"are tempting me and playing upon my youth, but you shall not move"
14217,BOOK XXIV.,"me, for you are offering me presents without the knowledge of"
14218,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles whom I fear and hold it great guilt to defraud, lest"
14219,BOOK XXIV.,some evil presently befall me; but as your guide I would go with
14220,BOOK XXIV.,"you even to Argos itself, and would guard you so carefully"
14221,BOOK XXIV.,"whether by sea or land, that no one should attack you through"
14222,BOOK XXIV.,making light of him who was with you.”
14223,BOOK XXIV.,
14224,BOOK XXIV.,"The bringer of good luck then sprang on to the chariot, and"
14225,BOOK XXIV.,seizing the whip and reins he breathed fresh spirit into the
14226,BOOK XXIV.,mules and horses. When they reached the trench and the wall that
14227,BOOK XXIV.,"was before the ships, those who were on guard had just been"
14228,BOOK XXIV.,"getting their suppers, and the slayer of Argus threw them all"
14229,BOOK XXIV.,"into a deep sleep. Then he drew back the bolts to open the gates,"
14230,BOOK XXIV.,and took Priam inside with the treasure he had upon his waggon.
14231,BOOK XXIV.,Ere long they came to the lofty dwelling of the son of Peleus for
14232,BOOK XXIV.,which the Myrmidons had cut pine and which they had built for
14233,BOOK XXIV.,their king; when they had built it they thatched it with coarse
14234,BOOK XXIV.,"tussock-grass which they had mown out on the plain, and all round"
14235,BOOK XXIV.,"it they made a large courtyard, which was fenced with stakes set"
14236,BOOK XXIV.,close together. The gate was barred with a single bolt of pine
14237,BOOK XXIV.,"which it took three men to force into its place, and three to"
14238,BOOK XXIV.,"draw back so as to open the gate, but Achilles could draw it by"
14239,BOOK XXIV.,"himself. Mercury opened the gate for the old man, and brought in"
14240,BOOK XXIV.,the treasure that he was taking with him for the son of Peleus.
14241,BOOK XXIV.,"Then he sprang from the chariot on to the ground and said, “Sir,"
14242,BOOK XXIV.,"it is I, immortal Mercury, that am come with you, for my father"
14243,BOOK XXIV.,"sent me to escort you. I will now leave you, and will not enter"
14244,BOOK XXIV.,"into the presence of Achilles, for it might anger him that a god"
14245,BOOK XXIV.,"should befriend mortal men thus openly. Go you within, and"
14246,BOOK XXIV.,embrace the knees of the son of Peleus: beseech him by his
14247,BOOK XXIV.,"father, his lovely mother, and his son; thus you may move him.”"
14248,BOOK XXIV.,
14249,BOOK XXIV.,With these words Mercury went back to high Olympus. Priam sprang
14250,BOOK XXIV.,"from his chariot to the ground, leaving Idaeus where he was, in"
14251,BOOK XXIV.,charge of the mules and horses. The old man went straight into
14252,BOOK XXIV.,"the house where Achilles, loved of the gods, was sitting. There"
14253,BOOK XXIV.,he found him with his men seated at a distance from him: only
14254,BOOK XXIV.,"two, the hero Automedon, and Alcimus of the race of Mars, were"
14255,BOOK XXIV.,"busy in attendance about his person, for he had but just done"
14256,BOOK XXIV.,"eating and drinking, and the table was still there. King Priam"
14257,BOOK XXIV.,"entered without their seeing him, and going right up to Achilles"
14258,BOOK XXIV.,he clasped his knees and kissed the dread murderous hands that
14259,BOOK XXIV.,had slain so many of his sons.
14260,BOOK XXIV.,
14261,BOOK XXIV.,As when some cruel spite has befallen a man that he should have
14262,BOOK XXIV.,"killed some one in his own country, and must fly to a great man’s"
14263,BOOK XXIV.,"protection in a land of strangers, and all marvel who see him,"
14264,BOOK XXIV.,even so did Achilles marvel as he beheld Priam. The others looked
14265,BOOK XXIV.,"one to another and marvelled also, but Priam besought Achilles"
14266,BOOK XXIV.,"saying, “Think of your father, O Achilles like unto the gods, who"
14267,BOOK XXIV.,"is such even as I am, on the sad threshold of old age. It may be"
14268,BOOK XXIV.,"that those who dwell near him harass him, and there is none to"
14269,BOOK XXIV.,keep war and ruin from him. Yet when he hears of you being still
14270,BOOK XXIV.,"alive, he is glad, and his days are full of hope that he shall"
14271,BOOK XXIV.,"see his dear son come home to him from Troy; but I, wretched man"
14272,BOOK XXIV.,"that I am, had the bravest in all Troy for my sons, and there is"
14273,BOOK XXIV.,not one of them left. I had fifty sons when the Achaeans came
14274,BOOK XXIV.,"here; nineteen of them were from a single womb, and the others"
14275,BOOK XXIV.,were borne to me by the women of my household. The greater part
14276,BOOK XXIV.,"of them has fierce Mars laid low, and Hector, him who was alone"
14277,BOOK XXIV.,"left, him who was the guardian of the city and ourselves, him"
14278,BOOK XXIV.,have you lately slain; therefore I am now come to the ships of
14279,BOOK XXIV.,the Achaeans to ransom his body from you with a great ransom.
14280,BOOK XXIV.,"Fear, O Achilles, the wrath of heaven; think on your own father"
14281,BOOK XXIV.,"and have compassion upon me, who am the more pitiable, for I have"
14282,BOOK XXIV.,"steeled myself as no man yet has ever steeled himself before me,"
14283,BOOK XXIV.,and have raised to my lips the hand of him who slew my son.”
14284,BOOK XXIV.,
14285,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spoke Priam, and the heart of Achilles yearned as he"
14286,BOOK XXIV.,bethought him of his father. He took the old man’s hand and moved
14287,BOOK XXIV.,"him gently away. The two wept bitterly—Priam, as he lay at"
14288,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles’ feet, weeping for Hector, and Achilles now for his"
14289,BOOK XXIV.,"father and now for Patroclus, till the house was filled with"
14290,BOOK XXIV.,their lamentation. But when Achilles was now sated with grief and
14291,BOOK XXIV.,"had unburthened the bitterness of his sorrow, he left his seat"
14292,BOOK XXIV.,"and raised the old man by the hand, in pity for his white hair"
14293,BOOK XXIV.,"and beard; then he said, “Unhappy man, you have indeed been"
14294,BOOK XXIV.,greatly daring; how could you venture to come alone to the ships
14295,BOOK XXIV.,"of the Achaeans, and enter the presence of him who has slain so"
14296,BOOK XXIV.,many of your brave sons? You must have iron courage: sit now upon
14297,BOOK XXIV.,"this seat, and for all our grief we will hide our sorrows in our"
14298,BOOK XXIV.,"hearts, for weeping will not avail us. The immortals know no"
14299,BOOK XXIV.,"care, yet the lot they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the"
14300,BOOK XXIV.,"floor of Jove’s palace there stand two urns, the one filled with"
14301,BOOK XXIV.,"evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He for whom Jove the"
14302,BOOK XXIV.,"lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good"
14303,BOOK XXIV.,and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Jove sends none but
14304,BOOK XXIV.,"evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of"
14305,BOOK XXIV.,"famine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go"
14306,BOOK XXIV.,"up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor"
14307,BOOK XXIV.,men. Even so did it befall Peleus; the gods endowed him with all
14308,BOOK XXIV.,"good things from his birth upwards, for he reigned over the"
14309,BOOK XXIV.,"Myrmidons excelling all men in prosperity and wealth, and mortal"
14310,BOOK XXIV.,though he was they gave him a goddess for his bride. But even on
14311,BOOK XXIV.,"him too did heaven send misfortune, for there is no race of royal"
14312,BOOK XXIV.,"children born to him in his house, save one son who is doomed to"
14313,BOOK XXIV.,die all untimely; nor may I take care of him now that he is
14314,BOOK XXIV.,"growing old, for I must stay here at Troy to be the bane of you"
14315,BOOK XXIV.,"and your children. And you too, O Priam, I have heard that you"
14316,BOOK XXIV.,were aforetime happy. They say that in wealth and plenitude of
14317,BOOK XXIV.,"offspring you surpassed all that is in Lesbos, the realm of Makar"
14318,BOOK XXIV.,"to the northward, Phrygia that is more inland, and those that"
14319,BOOK XXIV.,dwell upon the great Hellespont; but from the day when the
14320,BOOK XXIV.,"dwellers in heaven sent this evil upon you, war and slaughter"
14321,BOOK XXIV.,"have been about your city continually. Bear up against it, and"
14322,BOOK XXIV.,let there be some intervals in your sorrow. Mourn as you may for
14323,BOOK XXIV.,"your brave son, you will take nothing by it. You cannot raise him"
14324,BOOK XXIV.,"from the dead, ere you do so yet another sorrow shall befall"
14325,BOOK XXIV.,you.”
14326,BOOK XXIV.,
14327,BOOK XXIV.,"And Priam answered, “O king, bid me not be seated, while Hector"
14328,BOOK XXIV.,"is still lying uncared for in your tents, but accept the great"
14329,BOOK XXIV.,"ransom which I have brought you, and give him to me at once that"
14330,BOOK XXIV.,I may look upon him. May you prosper with the ransom and reach
14331,BOOK XXIV.,"your own land in safety, seeing that you have suffered me to live"
14332,BOOK XXIV.,and to look upon the light of the sun.”
14333,BOOK XXIV.,
14334,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles looked at him sternly and said, “Vex me, sir, no longer;"
14335,BOOK XXIV.,"I am of myself minded to give up the body of Hector. My mother,"
14336,BOOK XXIV.,"daughter of the old man of the sea, came to me from Jove to bid"
14337,BOOK XXIV.,"me deliver it to you. Moreover I know well, O Priam, and you"
14338,BOOK XXIV.,"cannot hide it, that some god has brought you to the ships of the"
14339,BOOK XXIV.,"Achaeans, for else, no man however strong and in his prime would"
14340,BOOK XXIV.,"dare to come to our host; he could neither pass our guard unseen,"
14341,BOOK XXIV.,"nor draw the bolt of my gates thus easily; therefore, provoke me"
14342,BOOK XXIV.,"no further, lest I sin against the word of Jove, and suffer you"
14343,BOOK XXIV.,"not, suppliant though you are, within my tents.”"
14344,BOOK XXIV.,
14345,BOOK XXIV.,The old man feared him and obeyed. Then the son of Peleus sprang
14346,BOOK XXIV.,"like a lion through the door of his house, not alone, but with"
14347,BOOK XXIV.,him went his two squires Automedon and Alcimus who were closer to
14348,BOOK XXIV.,him than any others of his comrades now that Patroclus was no
14349,BOOK XXIV.,"more. These unyoked the horses and mules, and bade Priam’s herald"
14350,BOOK XXIV.,and attendant be seated within the house. They lifted the ransom
14351,BOOK XXIV.,"for Hector’s body from the waggon, but they left two mantles and"
14352,BOOK XXIV.,"a goodly shirt, that Achilles might wrap the body in them when he"
14353,BOOK XXIV.,gave it to be taken home. Then he called to his servants and
14354,BOOK XXIV.,"ordered them to wash the body and anoint it, but he first took it"
14355,BOOK XXIV.,"to a place where Priam should not see it, lest if he did so, he"
14356,BOOK XXIV.,"should break out in the bitterness of his grief, and enrage"
14357,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles, who might then kill him and sin against the word of"
14358,BOOK XXIV.,"Jove. When the servants had washed the body and anointed it, and"
14359,BOOK XXIV.,"had wrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle, Achilles himself"
14360,BOOK XXIV.,"lifted it on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on the"
14361,BOOK XXIV.,waggon. He cried aloud as he did so and called on the name of his
14362,BOOK XXIV.,"dear comrade, “Be not angry with me, Patroclus,” he said, “if you"
14363,BOOK XXIV.,hear even in the house of Hades that I have given Hector to his
14364,BOOK XXIV.,"father for a ransom. It has been no unworthy one, and I will"
14365,BOOK XXIV.,share it equitably with you.”
14366,BOOK XXIV.,
14367,BOOK XXIV.,Achilles then went back into the tent and took his place on the
14368,BOOK XXIV.,"richly inlaid seat from which he had risen, by the wall that was"
14369,BOOK XXIV.,at right angles to the one against which Priam was sitting.
14370,BOOK XXIV.,"“Sir,” he said, “your son is now laid upon his bier and is"
14371,BOOK XXIV.,ransomed according to desire; you shall look upon him when you
14372,BOOK XXIV.,take him away at daybreak; for the present let us prepare our
14373,BOOK XXIV.,"supper. Even lovely Niobe had to think about eating, though her"
14374,BOOK XXIV.,twelve children—six daughters and six lusty sons—had been all
14375,BOOK XXIV.,slain in her house. Apollo killed the sons with arrows from his
14376,BOOK XXIV.,"silver bow, to punish Niobe, and Diana slew the daughters,"
14377,BOOK XXIV.,because Niobe had vaunted herself against Leto; she said Leto had
14378,BOOK XXIV.,"borne two children only, whereas she had herself borne"
14379,BOOK XXIV.,many—whereon the two killed the many. Nine days did they lie
14380,BOOK XXIV.,"weltering, and there was none to bury them, for the son of Saturn"
14381,BOOK XXIV.,turned the people into stone; but on the tenth day the gods in
14382,BOOK XXIV.,"heaven themselves buried them, and Niobe then took food, being"
14383,BOOK XXIV.,worn out with weeping. They say that somewhere among the rocks on
14384,BOOK XXIV.,"the mountain pastures of Sipylus, where the nymphs live that"
14385,BOOK XXIV.,"haunt the river Achelous, there, they say, she lives in stone and"
14386,BOOK XXIV.,still nurses the sorrows sent upon her by the hand of heaven.
14387,BOOK XXIV.,"Therefore, noble sir, let us two now take food; you can weep for"
14388,BOOK XXIV.,your dear son hereafter as you are bearing him back to Ilius—and
14389,BOOK XXIV.,many a tear will he cost you.”
14390,BOOK XXIV.,
14391,BOOK XXIV.,With this Achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of
14392,BOOK XXIV.,"silvery whiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready all"
14393,BOOK XXIV.,"in due order. They cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces,"
14394,BOOK XXIV.,"spitted them, and drew them off again when they were well"
14395,BOOK XXIV.,roasted. Automedon brought bread in fair baskets and served it
14396,BOOK XXIV.,"round the table, while Achilles dealt out the meat, and they laid"
14397,BOOK XXIV.,their hands on the good things that were before them. As soon as
14398,BOOK XXIV.,"they had had enough to eat and drink, Priam, descendant of"
14399,BOOK XXIV.,"Dardanus, marvelled at the strength and beauty of Achilles for he"
14400,BOOK XXIV.,"was as a god to see, and Achilles marvelled at Priam as he"
14401,BOOK XXIV.,listened to him and looked upon his noble presence. When they had
14402,BOOK XXIV.,"gazed their fill Priam spoke first. “And now, O king,” he said,"
14403,BOOK XXIV.,“take me to my couch that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed
14404,BOOK XXIV.,boon of sleep. Never once have my eyes been closed from the day
14405,BOOK XXIV.,your hands took the life of my son; I have grovelled without
14406,BOOK XXIV.,"ceasing in the mire of my stable-yard, making moan and brooding"
14407,BOOK XXIV.,"over my countless sorrows. Now, moreover, I have eaten bread and"
14408,BOOK XXIV.,drunk wine; hitherto I have tasted nothing.”
14409,BOOK XXIV.,
14410,BOOK XXIV.,As he spoke Achilles told his men and the women servants to set
14411,BOOK XXIV.,"beds in the room that was in the gatehouse, and make them with"
14412,BOOK XXIV.,"good red rugs, and spread coverlets on the top of them with"
14413,BOOK XXIV.,woollen cloaks for Priam and Idaeus to wear. So the maids went
14414,BOOK XXIV.,out carrying a torch and got the two beds ready in all haste.
14415,BOOK XXIV.,"Then Achilles said laughingly to Priam, “Dear sir, you shall lie"
14416,BOOK XXIV.,"outside, lest some counsellor of those who in due course keep"
14417,BOOK XXIV.,coming to advise with me should see you here in the darkness of
14418,BOOK XXIV.,"the flying night, and tell it to Agamemnon. This might cause"
14419,BOOK XXIV.,delay in the delivery of the body. And now tell me and tell me
14420,BOOK XXIV.,"true, for how many days would you celebrate the funeral rites of"
14421,BOOK XXIV.,"noble Hector? Tell me, that I may hold aloof from war and"
14422,BOOK XXIV.,restrain the host.”
14423,BOOK XXIV.,
14424,BOOK XXIV.,"And Priam answered, “Since, then, you suffer me to bury my noble"
14425,BOOK XXIV.,"son with all due rites, do thus, Achilles, and I shall be"
14426,BOOK XXIV.,grateful. You know how we are pent up within our city; it is far
14427,BOOK XXIV.,"for us to fetch wood from the mountain, and the people live in"
14428,BOOK XXIV.,"fear. Nine days, therefore, will we mourn Hector in my house; on"
14429,BOOK XXIV.,the tenth day we will bury him and there shall be a public feast
14430,BOOK XXIV.,in his honour; on the eleventh we will build a mound over his
14431,BOOK XXIV.,"ashes, and on the twelfth, if there be need, we will fight.”"
14432,BOOK XXIV.,
14433,BOOK XXIV.,"And Achilles answered, “All, King Priam, shall be as you have"
14434,BOOK XXIV.,said. I will stay our fighting for as long a time as you have
14435,BOOK XXIV.,named.”
14436,BOOK XXIV.,
14437,BOOK XXIV.,"As he spoke he laid his hand on the old man’s right wrist, in"
14438,BOOK XXIV.,token that he should have no fear; thus then did Priam and his
14439,BOOK XXIV.,"attendant sleep there in the forecourt, full of thought, while"
14440,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles lay in an inner room of the house, with fair Briseis by"
14441,BOOK XXIV.,his side.
14442,BOOK XXIV.,
14443,BOOK XXIV.,And now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through the
14444,BOOK XXIV.,"livelong night, but upon Mercury alone, the bringer of good luck,"
14445,BOOK XXIV.,sleep could take no hold for he was thinking all the time how to
14446,BOOK XXIV.,get King Priam away from the ships without his being seen by the
14447,BOOK XXIV.,strong force of sentinels. He hovered therefore over Priam’s head
14448,BOOK XXIV.,"and said, “Sir, now that Achilles has spared your life, you seem"
14449,BOOK XXIV.,to have no fear about sleeping in the thick of your foes. You
14450,BOOK XXIV.,"have paid a great ransom, and have received the body of your son;"
14451,BOOK XXIV.,were you still alive and a prisoner the sons whom you have left
14452,BOOK XXIV.,at home would have to give three times as much to free you; and
14453,BOOK XXIV.,so it would be if Agamemnon and the other Achaeans were to know
14454,BOOK XXIV.,of your being here.”
14455,BOOK XXIV.,
14456,BOOK XXIV.,When he heard this the old man was afraid and roused his servant.
14457,BOOK XXIV.,"Mercury then yoked their horses and mules, and drove them quickly"
14458,BOOK XXIV.,through the host so that no man perceived them. When they came to
14459,BOOK XXIV.,"the ford of eddying Xanthus, begotten of immortal Jove, Mercury"
14460,BOOK XXIV.,"went back to high Olympus, and dawn in robe of saffron began to"
14461,BOOK XXIV.,break over all the land. Priam and Idaeus then drove on toward
14462,BOOK XXIV.,"the city lamenting and making moan, and the mules drew the body"
14463,BOOK XXIV.,"of Hector. No one neither man nor woman saw them, till Cassandra,"
14464,BOOK XXIV.,"fair as golden Venus standing on Pergamus, caught sight of her"
14465,BOOK XXIV.,"dear father in his chariot, and his servant that was the city’s"
14466,BOOK XXIV.,"herald with him. Then she saw him that was lying upon the bier,"
14467,BOOK XXIV.,"drawn by the mules, and with a loud cry she went about the city"
14468,BOOK XXIV.,"saying, “Come hither Trojans, men and women, and look on Hector;"
14469,BOOK XXIV.,if ever you rejoiced to see him coming from battle when he was
14470,BOOK XXIV.,"alive, look now on him that was the glory of our city and all our"
14471,BOOK XXIV.,people.”
14472,BOOK XXIV.,
14473,BOOK XXIV.,"At this there was not man nor woman left in the city, so great a"
14474,BOOK XXIV.,sorrow had possessed them. Hard by the gates they met Priam as he
14475,BOOK XXIV.,was bringing in the body. Hector’s wife and his mother were the
14476,BOOK XXIV.,first to mourn him: they flew towards the waggon and laid their
14477,BOOK XXIV.,"hands upon his head, while the crowd stood weeping round them."
14478,BOOK XXIV.,"They would have stayed before the gates, weeping and lamenting"
14479,BOOK XXIV.,"the livelong day to the going down of the sun, had not Priam"
14480,BOOK XXIV.,"spoken to them from the chariot and said, “Make way for the mules"
14481,BOOK XXIV.,to pass you. Afterwards when I have taken the body home you shall
14482,BOOK XXIV.,have your fill of weeping.”
14483,BOOK XXIV.,
14484,BOOK XXIV.,"On this the people stood asunder, and made a way for the waggon."
14485,BOOK XXIV.,When they had borne the body within the house they laid it upon a
14486,BOOK XXIV.,"bed and seated minstrels round it to lead the dirge, whereon the"
14487,BOOK XXIV.,women joined in the sad music of their lament. Foremost among
14488,BOOK XXIV.,them all Andromache led their wailing as she clasped the head of
14489,BOOK XXIV.,"mighty Hector in her embrace. “Husband,” she cried, “you have"
14490,BOOK XXIV.,"died young, and leave me in your house a widow; he of whom we are"
14491,BOOK XXIV.,"the ill-starred parents is still a mere child, and I fear he may"
14492,BOOK XXIV.,not reach manhood. Ere he can do so our city will be razed and
14493,BOOK XXIV.,"overthrown, for you who watched over it are no more—you who were"
14494,BOOK XXIV.,"its saviour, the guardian of our wives and children. Our women"
14495,BOOK XXIV.,"will be carried away captives to the ships, and I among them;"
14496,BOOK XXIV.,"while you, my child, who will be with me will be put to some"
14497,BOOK XXIV.,"unseemly tasks, working for a cruel master. Or, may be, some"
14498,BOOK XXIV.,"Achaean will hurl you (O miserable death) from our walls, to"
14499,BOOK XXIV.,"avenge some brother, son, or father whom Hector slew; many of"
14500,BOOK XXIV.,"them have indeed bitten the dust at his hands, for your father’s"
14501,BOOK XXIV.,hand in battle was no light one. Therefore do the people mourn
14502,BOOK XXIV.,"him. You have left, O Hector, sorrow unutterable to your parents,"
14503,BOOK XXIV.,"and my own grief is greatest of all, for you did not stretch"
14504,BOOK XXIV.,"forth your arms and embrace me as you lay dying, nor say to me"
14505,BOOK XXIV.,any words that might have lived with me in my tears night and day
14506,BOOK XXIV.,for evermore.”
14507,BOOK XXIV.,
14508,BOOK XXIV.,"Bitterly did she weep the while, and the women joined in her"
14509,BOOK XXIV.,"lament. Hecuba in her turn took up the strains of woe. “Hector,”"
14510,BOOK XXIV.,"she cried, “dearest to me of all my children. So long as you were"
14511,BOOK XXIV.,"alive the gods loved you well, and even in death they have not"
14512,BOOK XXIV.,been utterly unmindful of you; for when Achilles took any other
14513,BOOK XXIV.,"of my sons, he would sell him beyond the seas, to Samos Imbrus or"
14514,BOOK XXIV.,"rugged Lemnos; and when he had slain you too with his sword, many"
14515,BOOK XXIV.,a time did he drag you round the sepulchre of his comrade—though
14516,BOOK XXIV.,"this could not give him life—yet here you lie all fresh as dew,"
14517,BOOK XXIV.,and comely as one whom Apollo has slain with his painless
14518,BOOK XXIV.,shafts.”
14519,BOOK XXIV.,
14520,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus did she too speak through her tears with bitter moan, and"
14521,BOOK XXIV.,then Helen for a third time took up the strain of lamentation.
14522,BOOK XXIV.,"“Hector,” said she, “dearest of all my brothers-in-law—for I am"
14523,BOOK XXIV.,wife to Alexandrus who brought me hither to Troy—would that I had
14524,BOOK XXIV.,died ere he did so—twenty years are come and gone since I left my
14525,BOOK XXIV.,"home and came from over the sea, but I have never heard one word"
14526,BOOK XXIV.,of insult or unkindness from you. When another would chide with
14527,BOOK XXIV.,"me, as it might be one of your brothers or sisters or of your"
14528,BOOK XXIV.,"brothers’ wives, or my mother-in-law—for Priam was as kind to me"
14529,BOOK XXIV.,as though he were my own father—you would rebuke and check them
14530,BOOK XXIV.,with words of gentleness and goodwill. Therefore my tears flow
14531,BOOK XXIV.,"both for you and for my unhappy self, for there is no one else in"
14532,BOOK XXIV.,"Troy who is kind to me, but all shrink and shudder as they go by"
14533,BOOK XXIV.,me.”
14534,BOOK XXIV.,
14535,BOOK XXIV.,She wept as she spoke and the vast crowd that was gathered round
14536,BOOK XXIV.,"her joined in her lament. Then King Priam spoke to them saying,"
14537,BOOK XXIV.,"“Bring wood, O Trojans, to the city, and fear no cunning ambush"
14538,BOOK XXIV.,"of the Argives, for Achilles when he dismissed me from the ships"
14539,BOOK XXIV.,gave me his word that they should not attack us until the morning
14540,BOOK XXIV.,of the twelfth day.”
14541,BOOK XXIV.,
14542,BOOK XXIV.,Forthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and gathered together
14543,BOOK XXIV.,before the city. Nine days long did they bring in great heaps of
14544,BOOK XXIV.,"wood, and on the morning of the tenth day with many tears they"
14545,BOOK XXIV.,"took brave Hector forth, laid his dead body upon the summit of"
14546,BOOK XXIV.,"the pile, and set the fire thereto. Then when the child of"
14547,BOOK XXIV.,"morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared on the eleventh day, the"
14548,BOOK XXIV.,"people again assembled, round the pyre of mighty Hector. When"
14549,BOOK XXIV.,"they were got together, they first quenched the fire with wine"
14550,BOOK XXIV.,"wherever it was burning, and then his brothers and comrades with"
14551,BOOK XXIV.,"many a bitter tear gathered his white bones, wrapped them in soft"
14552,BOOK XXIV.,"robes of purple, and laid them in a golden urn, which they placed"
14553,BOOK XXIV.,in a grave and covered over with large stones set close together.
14554,BOOK XXIV.,Then they built a barrow hurriedly over it keeping guard on every
14555,BOOK XXIV.,side lest the Achaeans should attack them before they had
14556,BOOK XXIV.,finished. When they had heaped up the barrow they went back again
14557,BOOK XXIV.,"into the city, and being well assembled they held high feast in"
14558,BOOK XXIV.,the house of Priam their king.
14559,BOOK XXIV.,
14560,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of Hector tamer of"
14561,BOOK XXIV.,horses.
