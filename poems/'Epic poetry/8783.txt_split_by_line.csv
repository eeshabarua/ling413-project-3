46,CANTO IX,
47,CANTO IX,"THE hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks"
48,CANTO IX,"Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back,"
49,CANTO IX,"Chas'd that from his which newly they had worn,"
50,CANTO IX,"And inwardly restrain'd it.  He, as one"
51,CANTO IX,"Who listens, stood attentive: for his eye"
52,CANTO IX,"Not far could lead him through the sable air,"
53,CANTO IX,"And the thick-gath'ring cloud.  ""It yet behooves"
54,CANTO IX,"We win this fight""--thus he began--""if not--"
55,CANTO IX,"Such aid to us is offer'd.--Oh, how long"
56,CANTO IX,"Me seems it, ere the promis'd help arrive!"""
57,CANTO IX,
58,CANTO IX,"I noted, how the sequel of his words"
59,CANTO IX,Clok'd their beginning; for the last he spake
60,CANTO IX,Agreed not with the first.  But not the less
61,CANTO IX,My fear was at his saying; sith I drew
62,CANTO IX,"To import worse perchance, than that he held,"
63,CANTO IX,"His mutilated speech.  ""Doth ever any"
64,CANTO IX,Into this rueful concave's extreme depth
65,CANTO IX,"Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain"
66,CANTO IX,"Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?"""
67,CANTO IX,
68,CANTO IX,"Thus I inquiring. ""Rarely,"" he replied,"
69,CANTO IX,"""It chances, that among us any makes"
70,CANTO IX,"This journey, which I wend.  Erewhile 'tis true"
71,CANTO IX,"Once came I here beneath, conjur'd by fell"
72,CANTO IX,"Erictho, sorceress, who compell'd the shades"
73,CANTO IX,Back to their bodies.  No long space my flesh
74,CANTO IX,"Was naked of me, when within these walls"
75,CANTO IX,"She made me enter, to draw forth a spirit"
76,CANTO IX,From out of Judas' circle.  Lowest place
77,CANTO IX,"Is that of all, obscurest, and remov'd"
78,CANTO IX,Farthest from heav'n's all-circling orb.  The road
79,CANTO IX,Full well I know: thou therefore rest secure.
80,CANTO IX,"That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round"
81,CANTO IX,"The city' of grief encompasses, which now"
82,CANTO IX,"We may not enter without rage.""  Yet more"
83,CANTO IX,"He added: but I hold it not in mind,"
84,CANTO IX,For that mine eye toward the lofty tower
85,CANTO IX,"Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top."
86,CANTO IX,Where in an instant I beheld uprisen
87,CANTO IX,At once three hellish furies stain'd with blood:
88,CANTO IX,In limb and motion feminine they seem'd;
89,CANTO IX,Around them greenest hydras twisting roll'd
90,CANTO IX,Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept
91,CANTO IX,"Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound."
92,CANTO IX,
93,CANTO IX,He knowing well the miserable hags
94,CANTO IX,"Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:"
95,CANTO IX,
96,CANTO IX,"""Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left"
97,CANTO IX,"This is Megaera; on the right hand she,"
98,CANTO IX,"Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone"
99,CANTO IX,"I' th' midst.""  This said, in silence he remain'd"
100,CANTO IX,Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves
101,CANTO IX,"Smote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais'd,"
102,CANTO IX,"That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound."
103,CANTO IX,"""Hasten Medusa: so to adamant"
104,CANTO IX,"Him shall we change;"" all looking down exclaim'd."
105,CANTO IX,"""E'en when by Theseus' might assail'd, we took"
106,CANTO IX,"No ill revenge.""  ""Turn thyself round, and keep"
107,CANTO IX,Thy count'nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire
108,CANTO IX,"Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return"
109,CANTO IX,"Upwards would be for ever lost.""  This said,"
110,CANTO IX,"Himself my gentle master turn'd me round,"
111,CANTO IX,"Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own"
112,CANTO IX,He also hid me.  Ye of intellect
113,CANTO IX,"Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal'd"
114,CANTO IX,Under close texture of the mystic strain!
115,CANTO IX,
116,CANTO IX,And now there came o'er the perturbed waves
117,CANTO IX,"Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made"
118,CANTO IX,"Either shore tremble, as if of a wind"
119,CANTO IX,"Impetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung,"
120,CANTO IX,"That 'gainst some forest driving all its might,"
121,CANTO IX,"Plucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls"
122,CANTO IX,Afar; then onward passing proudly sweeps
123,CANTO IX,"Its whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly."
124,CANTO IX,
125,CANTO IX,"Mine eyes he loos'd, and spake: ""And now direct"
126,CANTO IX,"Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam,"
127,CANTO IX,"There, thickest where the smoke ascends."" As frogs"
128,CANTO IX,"Before their foe the serpent, through the wave"
129,CANTO IX,"Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one"
130,CANTO IX,Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits
131,CANTO IX,"Destroy'd, so saw I fleeing before one"
132,CANTO IX,Who pass'd with unwet feet the Stygian sound.
133,CANTO IX,"He, from his face removing the gross air,"
134,CANTO IX,"Oft his left hand forth stretch'd, and seem'd alone"
135,CANTO IX,By that annoyance wearied.  I perceiv'd
136,CANTO IX,"That he was sent from heav'n, and to my guide"
137,CANTO IX,"Turn'd me, who signal made that I should stand"
138,CANTO IX,"Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full"
139,CANTO IX,Of noble anger seem'd he!  To the gate
140,CANTO IX,"He came, and with his wand touch'd it, whereat"
141,CANTO IX,Open without impediment it flew.
142,CANTO IX,
143,CANTO IX,"""Outcasts of heav'n!  O abject race and scorn'd!"""
144,CANTO IX,"Began he on the horrid grunsel standing,"
145,CANTO IX,"""Whence doth this wild excess of insolence"
146,CANTO IX,Lodge in you? wherefore kick you 'gainst that will
147,CANTO IX,"Ne'er frustrate of its end, and which so oft"
148,CANTO IX,Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs?
149,CANTO IX,What profits at the fays to but the horn?
150,CANTO IX,"Your Cerberus, if ye remember, hence"
151,CANTO IX,"Bears still, peel'd of their hair, his throat and maw."""
152,CANTO IX,
153,CANTO IX,"This said, he turn'd back o'er the filthy way,"
154,CANTO IX,"And syllable to us spake none, but wore"
155,CANTO IX,The semblance of a man by other care
156,CANTO IX,"Beset, and keenly press'd, than thought of him"
157,CANTO IX,Who in his presence stands.  Then we our steps
158,CANTO IX,"Toward that territory mov'd, secure"
159,CANTO IX,After the hallow'd words.  We unoppos'd
160,CANTO IX,There enter'd; and my mind eager to learn
161,CANTO IX,"What state a fortress like to that might hold,"
162,CANTO IX,"I soon as enter'd throw mine eye around,"
163,CANTO IX,And see on every part wide-stretching space
164,CANTO IX,Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.
165,CANTO IX,
166,CANTO IX,"As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles,"
167,CANTO IX,"Or as at Pola, near Quarnaro's gulf,"
168,CANTO IX,"That closes Italy and laves her bounds,"
169,CANTO IX,The place is all thick spread with sepulchres;
170,CANTO IX,"So was it here, save what in horror here"
171,CANTO IX,"Excell'd: for 'midst the graves were scattered flames,"
172,CANTO IX,"Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn'd,"
173,CANTO IX,That iron for no craft there hotter needs.
174,CANTO IX,
175,CANTO IX,"Their lids all hung suspended, and beneath"
176,CANTO IX,"From them forth issu'd lamentable moans,"
177,CANTO IX,Such as the sad and tortur'd well might raise.
178,CANTO IX,
179,CANTO IX,"I thus: ""Master! say who are these, interr'd"
180,CANTO IX,"Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear"
181,CANTO IX,"The dolorous sighs?""  He answer thus return'd:"
182,CANTO IX,
183,CANTO IX,"""The arch-heretics are here, accompanied"
184,CANTO IX,"By every sect their followers; and much more,"
185,CANTO IX,"Than thou believest, tombs are freighted: like"
186,CANTO IX,With like is buried; and the monuments
187,CANTO IX,"Are different in degrees of heat.""  This said,"
188,CANTO IX,"He to the right hand turning, on we pass'd"
189,CANTO IX,Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.
190,CANTO IX,

192,CANTO IX,
193,CANTO IX,
194,CANTO X,CANTO X
195,CANTO X,
196,CANTO X,"NOW by a secret pathway we proceed,"
197,CANTO X,"Between the walls, that hem the region round,"
198,CANTO X,"And the tormented souls: my master first,"
199,CANTO X,"I close behind his steps.  ""Virtue supreme!"""
200,CANTO X,"I thus began; ""who through these ample orbs"
201,CANTO X,"In circuit lead'st me, even as thou will'st,"
202,CANTO X,"Speak thou, and satisfy my wish.  May those,"
203,CANTO X,"Who lie within these sepulchres, be seen?"
204,CANTO X,"Already all the lids are rais'd, and none"
205,CANTO X,"O'er them keeps watch.""  He thus in answer spake"
206,CANTO X,"""They shall be closed all, what-time they here"
207,CANTO X,"From Josaphat return'd shall come, and bring"
208,CANTO X,"Their bodies, which above they now have left."
209,CANTO X,The cemetery on this part obtain
210,CANTO X,"With Epicurus all his followers,"
211,CANTO X,Who with the body make the spirit die.
212,CANTO X,Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon
213,CANTO X,"Both to the question ask'd, and to the wish,"
214,CANTO X,"Which thou conceal'st in silence.""  I replied:"
215,CANTO X,"""I keep not, guide belov'd! from thee my heart"
216,CANTO X,"Secreted, but to shun vain length of words,"
217,CANTO X,"A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself."""
218,CANTO X,
219,CANTO X,"""O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire"
220,CANTO X,"Alive art passing, so discreet of speech!"
221,CANTO X,Here please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance
222,CANTO X,Declares the place of thy nativity
223,CANTO X,"To be that noble land, with which perchance"
224,CANTO X,"I too severely dealt.""  Sudden that sound"
225,CANTO X,"Forth issu'd from a vault, whereat in fear"
226,CANTO X,I somewhat closer to my leader's side
227,CANTO X,"Approaching, he thus spake: ""What dost thou?  Turn."
228,CANTO X,"Lo, Farinata, there! who hath himself"
229,CANTO X,Uplifted: from his girdle upwards all
230,CANTO X,"Expos'd behold him.""  On his face was mine"
231,CANTO X,Already fix'd; his breast and forehead there
232,CANTO X,"Erecting, seem'd as in high scorn he held"
233,CANTO X,E'en hell.  Between the sepulchres to him
234,CANTO X,"My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt,"
235,CANTO X,"This warning added: ""See thy words be clear!"""
236,CANTO X,
237,CANTO X,"He, soon as there I stood at the tomb's foot,"
238,CANTO X,"Ey'd me a space, then in disdainful mood"
239,CANTO X,"Address'd me: ""Say, what ancestors were thine?"""
240,CANTO X,
241,CANTO X,"I, willing to obey him, straight reveal'd"
242,CANTO X,"The whole, nor kept back aught: whence he, his brow"
243,CANTO X,"Somewhat uplifting, cried: ""Fiercely were they"
244,CANTO X,"Adverse to me, my party, and the blood"
245,CANTO X,From whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad
246,CANTO X,"Scatter'd them.""  ""Though driv'n out, yet they each time"
247,CANTO X,"From all parts,"" answer'd I, ""return'd; an art"
248,CANTO X,"Which yours have shown, they are not skill'd to learn."""
249,CANTO X,
250,CANTO X,"Then, peering forth from the unclosed jaw,"
251,CANTO X,"Rose from his side a shade, high as the chin,"
252,CANTO X,"Leaning, methought, upon its knees uprais'd."
253,CANTO X,"It look'd around, as eager to explore"
254,CANTO X,If there were other with me; but perceiving
255,CANTO X,"That fond imagination quench'd, with tears"
256,CANTO X,"Thus spake: ""If thou through this blind prison go'st."
257,CANTO X,"Led by thy lofty genius and profound,"
258,CANTO X,"Where is my son? and wherefore not with thee?"""
259,CANTO X,
260,CANTO X,"I straight replied: ""Not of myself I come,"
261,CANTO X,"By him, who there expects me, through this clime"
262,CANTO X,"Conducted, whom perchance Guido thy son"
263,CANTO X,"Had in contempt.""  Already had his words"
264,CANTO X,"And mode of punishment read me his name,"
265,CANTO X,Whence I so fully answer'd.  He at once
266,CANTO X,"Exclaim'd, up starting, ""How! said'st thou he HAD?"
267,CANTO X,No longer lives he?  Strikes not on his eye
268,CANTO X,"The blessed daylight?""  Then of some delay"
269,CANTO X,"I made ere my reply aware, down fell"
270,CANTO X,"Supine, not after forth appear'd he more."
271,CANTO X,
272,CANTO X,"Meanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom"
273,CANTO X,"I yet was station'd, chang'd not count'nance stern,"
274,CANTO X,"Nor mov'd the neck, nor bent his ribbed side."
275,CANTO X,"""And if,"" continuing the first discourse,"
276,CANTO X,"""They in this art,"" he cried, ""small skill have shown,"
277,CANTO X,That doth torment me more e'en than this bed.
278,CANTO X,But not yet fifty times shall be relum'd
279,CANTO X,"Her aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm,"
280,CANTO X,Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art.
281,CANTO X,"So to the pleasant world mayst thou return,"
282,CANTO X,"As thou shalt tell me, why in all their laws,"
283,CANTO X,"Against my kin this people is so fell?"""
284,CANTO X,
285,CANTO X,"""The slaughter and great havoc,"" I replied,"
286,CANTO X,"""That colour'd Arbia's flood with crimson stain--"
287,CANTO X,"To these impute, that in our hallow'd dome"
288,CANTO X,"Such orisons ascend.""  Sighing he shook"
289,CANTO X,"The head, then thus resum'd: ""In that affray"
290,CANTO X,"I stood not singly, nor without just cause"
291,CANTO X,Assuredly should with the rest have stirr'd;
292,CANTO X,"But singly there I stood, when by consent"
293,CANTO X,"Of all, Florence had to the ground been raz'd,"
294,CANTO X,"The one who openly forbad the deed."""
295,CANTO X,
296,CANTO X,"""So may thy lineage find at last repose,"""
297,CANTO X,"I thus adjur'd him, ""as thou solve this knot,"
298,CANTO X,"Which now involves my mind.  If right I hear,"
299,CANTO X,"Ye seem to view beforehand, that which time"
300,CANTO X,"Leads with him, of the present uninform'd."""
301,CANTO X,
302,CANTO X,"""We view, as one who hath an evil sight,"""
303,CANTO X,"He answer'd, ""plainly, objects far remote:"
304,CANTO X,So much of his large spendour yet imparts
305,CANTO X,The' Almighty Ruler; but when they approach
306,CANTO X,"Or actually exist, our intellect"
307,CANTO X,"Then wholly fails, nor of your human state"
308,CANTO X,Except what others bring us know we aught.
309,CANTO X,"Hence therefore mayst thou understand, that all"
310,CANTO X,"Our knowledge in that instant shall expire,"
311,CANTO X,"When on futurity the portals close."""
312,CANTO X,
313,CANTO X,"Then conscious of my fault, and by remorse"
314,CANTO X,"Smitten, I added thus: ""Now shalt thou say"
315,CANTO X,"To him there fallen, that his offspring still"
316,CANTO X,"Is to the living join'd; and bid him know,"
317,CANTO X,"That if from answer silent I abstain'd,"
318,CANTO X,'Twas that my thought was occupied intent
319,CANTO X,"Upon that error, which thy help hath solv'd."""
320,CANTO X,
321,CANTO X,But now my master summoning me back
322,CANTO X,"I heard, and with more eager haste besought"
323,CANTO X,"The spirit to inform me, who with him"
324,CANTO X,Partook his lot.  He answer thus return'd:
325,CANTO X,
326,CANTO X,"""More than a thousand with me here are laid"
327,CANTO X,"Within is Frederick, second of that name,"
328,CANTO X,"And the Lord Cardinal, and of the rest"
329,CANTO X,"I speak not.""  He, this said, from sight withdrew."
330,CANTO X,But I my steps towards the ancient bard
331,CANTO X,"Reverting, ruminated on the words"
332,CANTO X,"Betokening me such ill.  Onward he mov'd,"
333,CANTO X,"And thus in going question'd: ""Whence the' amaze"
334,CANTO X,"That holds thy senses wrapt?""  I satisfied"
335,CANTO X,"The' inquiry, and the sage enjoin'd me straight:"
336,CANTO X,"""Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard"
337,CANTO X,"To thee importing harm; and note thou this,"""
338,CANTO X,"With his rais'd finger bidding me take heed,"
339,CANTO X,
340,CANTO X,"""When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam,"
341,CANTO X,"Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life"
342,CANTO X,"The future tenour will to thee unfold."""
343,CANTO X,
344,CANTO X,Forthwith he to the left hand turn'd his feet:
345,CANTO X,"We left the wall, and tow'rds the middle space"
346,CANTO X,"Went by a path, that to a valley strikes;"
347,CANTO X,Which e'en thus high exhal'd its noisome steam.
348,CANTO X,

352,CANTO XI,CANTO XI
353,CANTO XI,
354,CANTO XI,"UPON the utmost verge of a high bank,"
355,CANTO XI,"By craggy rocks environ'd round, we came,"
356,CANTO XI,Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow'd:
357,CANTO XI,And here to shun the horrible excess
358,CANTO XI,"Of fetid exhalation, upward cast"
359,CANTO XI,"From the profound abyss, behind the lid"
360,CANTO XI,"Of a great monument we stood retir'd,"
361,CANTO XI,
362,CANTO XI,"Whereon this scroll I mark'd: ""I have in charge"
363,CANTO XI,"Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew"
364,CANTO XI,From the right path.--Ere our descent behooves
365,CANTO XI,"We make delay, that somewhat first the sense,"
366,CANTO XI,"To the dire breath accustom'd, afterward"
367,CANTO XI,"Regard it not.""  My master thus; to whom"
368,CANTO XI,"Answering I spake: ""Some compensation find"
369,CANTO XI,"That the time past not wholly lost.""  He then:"
370,CANTO XI,"""Lo! how my thoughts e'en to thy wishes tend!"
371,CANTO XI,"My son! within these rocks,"" he thus began,"
372,CANTO XI,"""Are three close circles in gradation plac'd,"
373,CANTO XI,As these which now thou leav'st. Each one is full
374,CANTO XI,Of spirits accurs'd; but that the sight alone
375,CANTO XI,"Hereafter may suffice thee, listen how"
376,CANTO XI,And for what cause in durance they abide.
377,CANTO XI,
378,CANTO XI,"""Of all malicious act abhorr'd in heaven,"
379,CANTO XI,The end is injury; and all such end
380,CANTO XI,Either by force or fraud works other's woe
381,CANTO XI,"But fraud, because of man peculiar evil,"
382,CANTO XI,To God is more displeasing; and beneath
383,CANTO XI,The fraudulent are therefore doom'd to' endure
384,CANTO XI,Severer pang.  The violent occupy
385,CANTO XI,All the first circle; and because to force
386,CANTO XI,"Three persons are obnoxious, in three rounds"
387,CANTO XI,Hach within other sep'rate is it fram'd.
388,CANTO XI,"To God, his neighbour, and himself, by man"
389,CANTO XI,Force may be offer'd; to himself I say
390,CANTO XI,"And his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear"
391,CANTO XI,"At full.  Death, violent death, and painful wounds"
392,CANTO XI,Upon his neighbour he inflicts; and wastes
393,CANTO XI,"By devastation, pillage, and the flames,"
394,CANTO XI,"His substance.  Slayers, and each one that smites"
395,CANTO XI,"In malice, plund'rers, and all robbers, hence"
396,CANTO XI,The torment undergo of the first round
397,CANTO XI,In different herds.  Man can do violence
398,CANTO XI,To himself and his own blessings: and for this
399,CANTO XI,He in the second round must aye deplore
400,CANTO XI,"With unavailing penitence his crime,"
401,CANTO XI,"Whoe'er deprives himself of life and light,"
402,CANTO XI,"In reckless lavishment his talent wastes,"
403,CANTO XI,And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy.
404,CANTO XI,"To God may force be offer'd, in the heart"
405,CANTO XI,"Denying and blaspheming his high power,"
406,CANTO XI,And nature with her kindly law contemning.
407,CANTO XI,And thence the inmost round marks with its seal
408,CANTO XI,"Sodom and Cahors, and all such as speak"

415,CANTO XI,Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes.

418,CANTO XI,"Theft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce"
419,CANTO XI,"To lust, or set their honesty at pawn,"

459,CANTO XI,"Clearly points out, not in one part alone,"
460,CANTO XI,How imitative nature takes her course
461,CANTO XI,From the celestial mind and from its art:
462,CANTO XI,"And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds,"
463,CANTO XI,"Not many leaves scann'd o'er, observing well"
464,CANTO XI,"Thou shalt discover, that your art on her"

486,CANTO XII,THE place where to descend the precipice
487,CANTO XII,"We came, was rough as Alp, and on its verge"
488,CANTO XII,"Such object lay, as every eye would shun."
489,CANTO XII,
490,CANTO XII,"As is that ruin, which Adice's stream"
491,CANTO XII,"On this side Trento struck, should'ring the wave,"
492,CANTO XII,Or loos'd by earthquake or for lack of prop;
493,CANTO XII,"For from the mountain's summit, whence it mov'd"
494,CANTO XII,"To the low level, so the headlong rock"
495,CANTO XII,"Is shiver'd, that some passage it might give"
496,CANTO XII,To him who from above would pass; e'en such
497,CANTO XII,Into the chasm was that descent: and there
498,CANTO XII,At point of the disparted ridge lay stretch'd
499,CANTO XII,"The infamy of Crete, detested brood"
500,CANTO XII,Of the feign'd heifer: and at sight of us

512,CANTO XII,Plunges on either side; so saw I plunge
513,CANTO XII,The Minotaur; whereat the sage exclaim'd:
514,CANTO XII,"""Run to the passage! while he storms, 't is well"
515,CANTO XII,"That thou descend.""  Thus down our road we took"
516,CANTO XII,"Through those dilapidated crags, that oft"
517,CANTO XII,"Mov'd underneath my feet, to weight like theirs"
518,CANTO XII,"Unus'd.  I pond'ring went, and thus he spake:"
519,CANTO XII,
520,CANTO XII,"""Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin'd steep,"
521,CANTO XII,"Guarded by the brute violence, which I"
522,CANTO XII,"Have vanquish'd now. Know then, that when I erst"
523,CANTO XII,"Hither descended to the nether hell,"
524,CANTO XII,This rock was not yet fallen.  But past doubt
525,CANTO XII,"(If well I mark) not long ere He arrived,"
526,CANTO XII,Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil
527,CANTO XII,"Of the highest circle, then through all its bounds"
528,CANTO XII,"Such trembling seiz'd the deep concave and foul,"
529,CANTO XII,"I thought the universe was thrill'd with love,"
530,CANTO XII,"Whereby, there are who deem, the world hath oft"
531,CANTO XII,"Been into chaos turn'd: and in that point,"
532,CANTO XII,"Here, and elsewhere, that old rock toppled down."
533,CANTO XII,But fix thine eyes beneath: the river of blood
534,CANTO XII,"Approaches, in the which all those are steep'd,"
535,CANTO XII,"Who have by violence injur'd.""  O blind lust!"
536,CANTO XII,O foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on
537,CANTO XII,"In the brief life, and in the eternal then"
538,CANTO XII,Thus miserably o'erwhelm us.  I beheld
539,CANTO XII,"An ample foss, that in a bow was bent,"
540,CANTO XII,As circling all the plain; for so my guide
541,CANTO XII,Had told.  Between it and the rampart's base
542,CANTO XII,"On trail ran Centaurs, with keen arrows arm'd,"
543,CANTO XII,As to the chase they on the earth were wont.
544,CANTO XII,
545,CANTO XII,At seeing us descend they each one stood;
546,CANTO XII,"And issuing from the troop, three sped with bows"
547,CANTO XII,And missile weapons chosen first; of whom
548,CANTO XII,"One cried from far: ""Say to what pain ye come"

555,CANTO XII,
556,CANTO XII,"Then me he touch'd, and spake: ""Nessus is this,"
557,CANTO XII,"Who for the fair Deianira died,"
558,CANTO XII,And wrought himself revenge for his own fate.
559,CANTO XII,"He in the midst, that on his breast looks down,"
560,CANTO XII,Is the great Chiron who Achilles nurs'd;
561,CANTO XII,"That other Pholus, prone to wrath.""  Around"
562,CANTO XII,"The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts"

564,CANTO XII,"From out the blood, more than his guilt allows."
565,CANTO XII,
566,CANTO XII,"We to those beasts, that rapid strode along,"
567,CANTO XII,"Drew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth,"
568,CANTO XII,And with the notch push'd back his shaggy beard
569,CANTO XII,"To the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view"
570,CANTO XII,"Exposing, to his fellows thus exclaim'd:"
571,CANTO XII,"""Are ye aware, that he who comes behind"

574,CANTO XII,"Stood near his breast, where the two natures join,"
575,CANTO XII,"Thus made reply: ""He is indeed alive,"
576,CANTO XII,And solitary so must needs by me
577,CANTO XII,"Be shown the gloomy vale, thereto induc'd"
578,CANTO XII,"By strict necessity, not by delight."
579,CANTO XII,"She left her joyful harpings in the sky,"
580,CANTO XII,Who this new office to my care consign'd.
581,CANTO XII,"He is no robber, no dark spirit I."
582,CANTO XII,"But by that virtue, which empowers my step"
583,CANTO XII,"To treat so wild a path, grant us, I pray,"
584,CANTO XII,"One of thy band, whom we may trust secure,"
585,CANTO XII,"Who to the ford may lead us, and convey"
586,CANTO XII,"Across, him mounted on his back; for he"
587,CANTO XII,"Is not a spirit that may walk the air."""
588,CANTO XII,
589,CANTO XII,"Then on his right breast turning, Chiron thus"
590,CANTO XII,"To Nessus spake: ""Return, and be their guide."
591,CANTO XII,"And if ye chance to cross another troop,"
592,CANTO XII,"Command them keep aloof.""  Onward we mov'd,"
593,CANTO XII,"The faithful escort by our side, along"
594,CANTO XII,"The border of the crimson-seething flood,"
595,CANTO XII,Whence from those steep'd within loud shrieks arose.
596,CANTO XII,
597,CANTO XII,"Some there I mark'd, as high as to their brow"
598,CANTO XII,"Immers'd, of whom the mighty Centaur thus:"
599,CANTO XII,"""These are the souls of tyrants, who were given"
600,CANTO XII,To blood and rapine.  Here they wail aloud
601,CANTO XII,"Their merciless wrongs.  Here Alexander dwells,"
602,CANTO XII,"And Dionysius fell, who many a year"
603,CANTO XII,Of woe wrought for fair Sicily.  That brow
604,CANTO XII,"Whereon the hair so jetty clust'ring hangs,"
605,CANTO XII,Is Azzolino; that with flaxen locks
606,CANTO XII,"Obizzo' of Este, in the world destroy'd"
607,CANTO XII,"By his foul step-son.""  To the bard rever'd"
608,CANTO XII,"I turned me round, and thus he spake; ""Let him"
609,CANTO XII,"Be to thee now first leader, me but next"
610,CANTO XII,"To him in rank.""  Then farther on a space"
611,CANTO XII,"The Centaur paus'd, near some, who at the throat"
612,CANTO XII,Were extant from the wave; and showing us
613,CANTO XII,"A spirit by itself apart retir'd,"
614,CANTO XII,"Exclaim'd: ""He in God's bosom smote the heart,"
615,CANTO XII,"Which yet is honour'd on the bank of Thames."""

618,CANTO XII,And even all the bust above the stream.
619,CANTO XII,'Midst these I many a face remember'd well.
