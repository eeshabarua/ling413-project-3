47,ARGUMENT,ARGUMENT
48,ARGUMENT,
49,ARGUMENT,"In a council of the Gods, Minerva calls their attention to Ulysses, still"
50,ARGUMENT,a wanderer. They resolve to grant him a safe return to Ithaca. Minerva
51,ARGUMENT,"descends to encourage Telemachus, and in the form of Mentes directs him"
52,ARGUMENT,in what manner to proceed. Throughout this book the extravagance and
53,ARGUMENT,profligacy of the suitors are occasionally suggested.
54,ARGUMENT,
55,ARGUMENT,
56,ARGUMENT,"Muse make the man thy theme, for shrewdness famed"
57,ARGUMENT,"And genius versatile, who far and wide"
58,ARGUMENT,"A Wand'rer, after Ilium overthrown,"
59,ARGUMENT,"Discover'd various cities, and the mind"
60,ARGUMENT,"And manners learn'd of men, in lands remote."
61,ARGUMENT,"He num'rous woes on Ocean toss'd, endured,"
62,ARGUMENT,"Anxious to save himself, and to conduct"
63,ARGUMENT,His followers to their home; yet all his care
64,ARGUMENT,Preserved them not; they perish'd self-destroy'd
65,ARGUMENT,By their own fault; infatuate! who devoured                       10
66,ARGUMENT,"The oxen of the all-o'erseeing Sun,"
67,ARGUMENT,"And, punish'd for that crime, return'd no more."
68,ARGUMENT,"Daughter divine of Jove, these things record,"
69,ARGUMENT,"As it may please thee, even in our ears."
70,ARGUMENT,"The rest, all those who had perdition 'scaped"
71,ARGUMENT,"By war or on the Deep, dwelt now at home;"
72,ARGUMENT,"Him only, of his country and his wife"
73,ARGUMENT,"Alike desirous, in her hollow grots"
74,ARGUMENT,"Calypso, Goddess beautiful, detained"
75,ARGUMENT,"Wooing him to her arms. But when, at length,                      20"
76,ARGUMENT,(Many a long year elapsed) the year arrived
77,ARGUMENT,Of his return (by the decree of heav'n)
78,ARGUMENT,"To Ithaca, not even then had he,"
79,ARGUMENT,"Although surrounded by his people, reach'd"
80,ARGUMENT,The period of his suff'rings and his toils.
81,ARGUMENT,"Yet all the Gods, with pity moved, beheld"
82,ARGUMENT,"His woes, save Neptune; He alone with wrath"
83,ARGUMENT,Unceasing and implacable pursued
84,ARGUMENT,Godlike Ulysses to his native shores.
85,ARGUMENT,"But Neptune, now, the Æthiopians fought,                          30"
86,ARGUMENT,"(The Æthiopians, utmost of mankind,"
87,ARGUMENT,"These Eastward situate, those toward the West)"
88,ARGUMENT,Call'd to an hecatomb of bulls and lambs.
89,ARGUMENT,"There sitting, pleas'd he banqueted; the Gods"
90,ARGUMENT,"In Jove's abode, meantime, assembled all,"
91,ARGUMENT,'Midst whom the Sire of heav'n and earth began.
92,ARGUMENT,For he recall'd to mind Ægisthus slain
93,ARGUMENT,By Agamemnon's celebrated son
94,ARGUMENT,"Orestes, and retracing in his thought"
95,ARGUMENT,"That dread event, the Immortals thus address'd.                   40"
96,ARGUMENT,Alas! how prone are human-kind to blame
97,ARGUMENT,"The Pow'rs of Heav'n! From us, they say, proceed"
98,ARGUMENT,"The ills which they endure, yet more than Fate"
99,ARGUMENT,"Herself inflicts, by their own crimes incur."
100,ARGUMENT,"So now Ægisthus, by no force constrained"
101,ARGUMENT,"Of Destiny, Atrides' wedded wife"
102,ARGUMENT,"Took to himself, and him at his return"
103,ARGUMENT,"Slew, not unwarn'd of his own dreadful end"
104,ARGUMENT,By us: for we commanded Hermes down
105,ARGUMENT,"The watchful Argicide, who bade him fear                          50"
106,ARGUMENT,"Alike, to slay the King, or woo the Queen."
107,ARGUMENT,"For that Atrides' son Orestes, soon"
108,ARGUMENT,"As grown mature, and eager to assume"
109,ARGUMENT,"His sway imperial, should avenge the deed."
110,ARGUMENT,"So Hermes spake, but his advice moved not"
111,ARGUMENT,"Ægisthus, on whose head the whole arrear"
112,ARGUMENT,"Of vengeance heap'd, at last, hath therefore fall'n."
113,ARGUMENT,Whom answer'd then Pallas cærulean-eyed.
114,ARGUMENT,"Oh Jove, Saturnian Sire, o'er all supreme!"
115,ARGUMENT,And well he merited the death he found;                           60
116,ARGUMENT,"So perish all, who shall, like him, offend."
117,ARGUMENT,But with a bosom anguish-rent I view
118,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, hapless Chief! who from his friends"
119,ARGUMENT,"Remote, affliction hath long time endured"
120,ARGUMENT,"In yonder wood-land isle, the central boss"
121,ARGUMENT,"Of Ocean. That retreat a Goddess holds,"
122,ARGUMENT,"Daughter of sapient Atlas, who the abyss"
123,ARGUMENT,"Knows to its bottom, and the pillars high"
124,ARGUMENT,Himself upbears which sep'rate earth from heav'n.
125,ARGUMENT,"His daughter, there, the sorrowing Chief detains,                 70"
126,ARGUMENT,And ever with smooth speech insidious seeks
127,ARGUMENT,To wean his heart from Ithaca; meantime
128,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, happy might he but behold"
129,ARGUMENT,"The smoke ascending from his native land,"
130,ARGUMENT,"Death covets. Canst thou not, Olympian Jove!"
131,ARGUMENT,At last relent? Hath not Ulysses oft
132,ARGUMENT,With victims slain amid Achaia's fleet
133,ARGUMENT,"Thee gratified, while yet at Troy he fought?"
134,ARGUMENT,"How hath he then so deep incensed thee, Jove?"
135,ARGUMENT,"To whom, the cloud-assembler God replied.                       80"
136,ARGUMENT,"What word hath pass'd thy lips, Daughter belov'd?"
137,ARGUMENT,Can I forget Ulysses? Him forget
138,ARGUMENT,"So noble, who in wisdom all mankind"
139,ARGUMENT,"Excels, and who hath sacrific'd so oft"
140,ARGUMENT,To us whose dwelling is the boundless heav'n?
141,ARGUMENT,Earth-circling Neptune--He it is whose wrath
142,ARGUMENT,Pursues him ceaseless for the Cyclops' sake
143,ARGUMENT,"Polypheme, strongest of the giant race,"
144,ARGUMENT,Whom of his eye Ulysses hath deprived.
145,ARGUMENT,"For Him, Thoösa bore, Nymph of the sea                            90"
146,ARGUMENT,"From Phorcys sprung, by Ocean's mighty pow'r"
147,ARGUMENT,Impregnated in caverns of the Deep.
148,ARGUMENT,"E'er since that day, the Shaker of the shores,"
149,ARGUMENT,"Although he slay him not, yet devious drives"
150,ARGUMENT,Ulysses from his native isle afar.
151,ARGUMENT,Yet come--in full assembly his return
152,ARGUMENT,"Contrive we now, both means and prosp'rous end;"
153,ARGUMENT,"So Neptune shall his wrath remit, whose pow'r"
154,ARGUMENT,In contest with the force of all the Gods
155,ARGUMENT,"Exerted single, can but strive in vain.                          100"
156,ARGUMENT,"To whom Minerva, Goddess azure-eyed."
157,ARGUMENT,Oh Jupiter! above all Kings enthroned!
158,ARGUMENT,If the Immortals ever-blest ordain
159,ARGUMENT,"That wise Ulysses to his home return,"
160,ARGUMENT,"Dispatch we then Hermes the Argicide,"
161,ARGUMENT,"Our messenger, hence to Ogygia's isle,"
162,ARGUMENT,"Who shall inform Calypso, nymph divine,"
163,ARGUMENT,"Of this our fixt resolve, that to his home"
164,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, toil-enduring Chief, repair."
165,ARGUMENT,"Myself will hence to Ithaca, meantime,                           110"
166,ARGUMENT,"His son to animate, and with new force"
167,ARGUMENT,"Inspire, that (the Achaians all convened"
168,ARGUMENT,"In council,) he may, instant, bid depart"
169,ARGUMENT,"The suitors from his home, who, day by day,"
170,ARGUMENT,His num'rous flocks and fatted herds consume.
171,ARGUMENT,"And I will send him thence to Sparta forth,"
172,ARGUMENT,"And into sandy Pylus, there to hear"
173,ARGUMENT,"(If hear he may) some tidings of his Sire,"
174,ARGUMENT,And to procure himself a glorious name.
175,ARGUMENT,"This said, her golden sandals to her feet                      120"
176,ARGUMENT,"She bound, ambrosial, which o'er all the earth"
177,ARGUMENT,"And o'er the moist flood waft her fleet as air,"
178,ARGUMENT,"Then, seizing her strong spear pointed with brass,"
179,ARGUMENT,"In length and bulk, and weight a matchless beam,"
180,ARGUMENT,With which the Jove-born Goddess levels ranks
181,ARGUMENT,"Of Heroes, against whom her anger burns,"
182,ARGUMENT,"From the Olympian summit down she flew,"
183,ARGUMENT,And on the threshold of Ulysses' hall
184,ARGUMENT,"In Ithaca, and within his vestibule"
185,ARGUMENT,"Apparent stood; there, grasping her bright spear,                130"
186,ARGUMENT,"Mentes[1] she seem'd, the hospitable Chief"
187,ARGUMENT,Of Taphos' isle--she found the haughty throng
188,ARGUMENT,The suitors; they before the palace gate
189,ARGUMENT,"With iv'ry cubes sported, on num'rous hides"
190,ARGUMENT,Reclined of oxen which themselves had slain.
191,ARGUMENT,The heralds and the busy menials there
192,ARGUMENT,Minister'd to them; these their mantling cups
193,ARGUMENT,With water slaked; with bibulous sponges those
194,ARGUMENT,"Made clean the tables, set the banquet on,"
195,ARGUMENT,And portioned out to each his plenteous share.                   140
196,ARGUMENT,Long ere the rest Telemachus himself
197,ARGUMENT,"Mark'd her, for sad amid them all he sat,"
198,ARGUMENT,Pourtraying in deep thought contemplative
199,ARGUMENT,"His noble Sire, and questioning if yet"
200,ARGUMENT,Perchance the Hero might return to chase
201,ARGUMENT,"From all his palace that imperious herd,"
202,ARGUMENT,To his own honour lord of his own home.
203,ARGUMENT,"Amid them musing thus, sudden he saw"
204,ARGUMENT,"The Goddess, and sprang forth, for he abhorr'd"
205,ARGUMENT,To see a guest's admittance long delay'd;                        150
206,ARGUMENT,"Approaching eager, her right hand he seized,"
207,ARGUMENT,"The brazen spear took from her, and in words"
208,ARGUMENT,With welcome wing'd Minerva thus address'd.
209,ARGUMENT,"Stranger, all hail! to share our cordial love"
210,ARGUMENT,"Thou com'st; the banquet finish'd, thou shalt next"
211,ARGUMENT,Inform me wherefore thou hast here arrived.
212,ARGUMENT,"So saying, toward the spacious hall he moved,"
213,ARGUMENT,"Follow'd by Pallas, and, arriving soon"
214,ARGUMENT,"Beneath the lofty roof, placed her bright spear"
215,ARGUMENT,"Within a pillar's cavity, long time                              160"
216,ARGUMENT,"The armoury where many a spear had stood,"
217,ARGUMENT,Bright weapons of his own illustrious Sire.
218,ARGUMENT,"Then, leading her toward a footstool'd throne"
219,ARGUMENT,"Magnificent, which first he overspread"
220,ARGUMENT,"With linen, there he seated her, apart"
221,ARGUMENT,"From that rude throng, and for himself disposed"
222,ARGUMENT,"A throne of various colours at her side,"
223,ARGUMENT,"Lest, stunn'd with clamour of the lawless band,"
224,ARGUMENT,"The new-arrived should loth perchance to eat,"
225,ARGUMENT,And that more free he might the stranger's ear                   170
226,ARGUMENT,"With questions of his absent Sire address,"
227,ARGUMENT,"And now a maiden charg'd with golden ew'r,"
228,ARGUMENT,"And with an argent laver, pouring first"
229,ARGUMENT,"Pure water on their hands, supplied them, next,"
230,ARGUMENT,"With a resplendent table, which the chaste"
231,ARGUMENT,Directress of the stores furnish'd with bread
232,ARGUMENT,"And dainties, remnants of the last regale."
233,ARGUMENT,"Then, in his turn, the sewer[2] with sav'ry meats,"
234,ARGUMENT,"Dish after dish, served them, of various kinds,"
235,ARGUMENT,"And golden cups beside the chargers placed,                      180"
236,ARGUMENT,Which the attendant herald fill'd with wine.
237,ARGUMENT,"Ere long, in rush'd the suitors, and the thrones"
238,ARGUMENT,"And couches occupied, on all whose hands"
239,ARGUMENT,The heralds pour'd pure water; then the maids
240,ARGUMENT,"Attended them with bread in baskets heap'd,"
241,ARGUMENT,And eager they assail'd the ready feast.
242,ARGUMENT,"At length, when neither thirst nor hunger more"
243,ARGUMENT,"They felt unsatisfied, to new delights"
244,ARGUMENT,"Their thoughts they turn'd, to song and sprightly dance,"
245,ARGUMENT,Enlivening sequel of the banquet's joys.                         190
246,ARGUMENT,"An herald, then, to Phemius' hand consign'd"
247,ARGUMENT,His beauteous lyre; he through constraint regaled
248,ARGUMENT,"The suitors with his song, and while the chords"
249,ARGUMENT,"He struck in prelude to his pleasant strains,"
250,ARGUMENT,Telemachus his head inclining nigh
251,ARGUMENT,"To Pallas' ear, lest others should his words"
252,ARGUMENT,"Witness, the blue-eyed Goddess thus bespake."
253,ARGUMENT,My inmate and my friend! far from my lips
254,ARGUMENT,Be ev'ry word that might displease thine ear!
255,ARGUMENT,"The song--the harp,--what can they less than charm               200"
256,ARGUMENT,These wantons? who the bread unpurchased eat
257,ARGUMENT,Of one whose bones on yonder continent
258,ARGUMENT,"Lie mould'ring, drench'd by all the show'rs of heaven,"
259,ARGUMENT,Or roll at random in the billowy deep.
260,ARGUMENT,Ah! could they see him once to his own isle
261,ARGUMENT,"Restored, both gold and raiment they would wish"
262,ARGUMENT,"Far less, and nimbleness of foot instead."
263,ARGUMENT,"But He, alas! hath by a wretched fate,"
264,ARGUMENT,"Past question perish'd, and what news soe'er"
265,ARGUMENT,"We hear of his return, kindles no hope                           210"
266,ARGUMENT,"In us, convinced that he returns no more."
267,ARGUMENT,But answer undissembling; tell me true;
268,ARGUMENT,Who art thou? whence? where stands thy city? where
269,ARGUMENT,Thy father's mansion? In what kind of ship
270,ARGUMENT,Cam'st thou? Why steer'd the mariners their course
271,ARGUMENT,"To Ithaca, and of what land are they?"
272,ARGUMENT,"For that on foot thou found'st us not, is sure."
273,ARGUMENT,"This also tell me, hast thou now arrived"
274,ARGUMENT,"New to our isle, or wast thou heretofore"
275,ARGUMENT,My father's guest? Since many to our house                       220
276,ARGUMENT,"Resorted in those happier days, for he"
277,ARGUMENT,Drew pow'rful to himself the hearts of all.
278,ARGUMENT,"Then Pallas thus, Goddess cærulean-eyed."
279,ARGUMENT,I will with all simplicity of truth
280,ARGUMENT,Thy questions satisfy. Behold in me
281,ARGUMENT,"Mentes, the offspring of a Chief renown'd"
282,ARGUMENT,"In war, Anchialus; and I rule, myself,"
283,ARGUMENT,"An island race, the Taphians oar-expert."
284,ARGUMENT,"With ship and mariners I now arrive,"
285,ARGUMENT,Seeking a people of another tongue                               230
286,ARGUMENT,"Athwart the gloomy flood, in quest of brass"
287,ARGUMENT,"For which I barter steel, ploughing the waves"
288,ARGUMENT,To Temesa. My ship beneath the woods
289,ARGUMENT,"Of Neïus, at yonder field that skirts"
290,ARGUMENT,"Your city, in the haven Rhethrus rides."
291,ARGUMENT,We are hereditary guests; our Sires
292,ARGUMENT,"Were friends long since; as, when thou seest him next,"
293,ARGUMENT,"The Hero old Laertes will avouch,"
294,ARGUMENT,"Of whom, I learn, that he frequents no more"
295,ARGUMENT,"The city now, but in sequester'd scenes                          240"
296,ARGUMENT,"Dwells sorrowful, and by an antient dame"
297,ARGUMENT,With food and drink supplied oft as he feels
298,ARGUMENT,"Refreshment needful to him, while he creeps"
299,ARGUMENT,Between the rows of his luxuriant vines.
300,ARGUMENT,"But I have come drawn hither by report,"
301,ARGUMENT,"Which spake thy Sire arrived, though still it seems"
302,ARGUMENT,The adverse Gods his homeward course retard.
303,ARGUMENT,"For not yet breathless lies the noble Chief,"
304,ARGUMENT,But in some island of the boundless flood
305,ARGUMENT,"Resides a prisoner, by barbarous force                           250"
306,ARGUMENT,Of some rude race detained reluctant there.
307,ARGUMENT,And I will now foreshow thee what the Gods
308,ARGUMENT,"Teach me, and what, though neither augur skill'd"
309,ARGUMENT,"Nor prophet, I yet trust shall come to pass."
310,ARGUMENT,"He shall not, henceforth, live an exile long"
311,ARGUMENT,"From his own shores, no, not although in bands"
312,ARGUMENT,"Of iron held, but will ere long contrive"
313,ARGUMENT,"His own return; for in expedients, framed"
314,ARGUMENT,"With wond'rous ingenuity, he abounds."
315,ARGUMENT,"But tell me true; art thou, in stature such,                     260"
316,ARGUMENT,Son of himself Ulysses? for thy face
317,ARGUMENT,"And eyes bright-sparkling, strongly indicate"
318,ARGUMENT,Ulysses in thee. Frequent have we both
319,ARGUMENT,"Conversed together thus, thy Sire and I,"
320,ARGUMENT,"Ere yet he went to Troy, the mark to which"
321,ARGUMENT,So many Princes of Achaia steer'd.
322,ARGUMENT,"Him since I saw not, nor Ulysses me."
323,ARGUMENT,"To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied."
324,ARGUMENT,Stranger! I tell thee true; my mother's voice
325,ARGUMENT,"Affirms me his, but since no mortal knows                        270"
326,ARGUMENT,"His derivation, I affirm it not."
327,ARGUMENT,"Would I had been son of some happier Sire,"
328,ARGUMENT,Ordain'd in calm possession of his own
329,ARGUMENT,"To reach the verge of life. But now, report"
330,ARGUMENT,"Proclaims me his, whom I of all mankind"
331,ARGUMENT,Unhappiest deem.--Thy question is resolved.
332,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus Pallas blue-eyed return'd.
333,ARGUMENT,"From no ignoble race, in future days,"
334,ARGUMENT,"The Gods shall prove thee sprung, whom so endow'd"
335,ARGUMENT,With ev'ry grace Penelope hath borne.                            280
336,ARGUMENT,But tell me true. What festival is this?
337,ARGUMENT,This throng--whence are they? wherefore hast thou need
338,ARGUMENT,Of such a multitude? Behold I here
339,ARGUMENT,"A banquet, or a nuptial? for these"
340,ARGUMENT,"Meet not by contribution[3] to regale,"
341,ARGUMENT,With such brutality and din they hold
342,ARGUMENT,Their riotous banquet! a wise man and good
343,ARGUMENT,"Arriving, now, among them, at the sight"
344,ARGUMENT,Of such enormities would much be wroth.
345,ARGUMENT,To whom replied Telemachus discrete.                           290
346,ARGUMENT,"Since, stranger! thou hast ask'd, learn also this."
347,ARGUMENT,"While yet Ulysses, with his people dwelt,"
348,ARGUMENT,His presence warranted the hope that here
349,ARGUMENT,Virtue should dwell and opulence; but heav'n
350,ARGUMENT,"Hath cast for us, at length, a diff'rent lot,"
351,ARGUMENT,"And he is lost, as never man before."
352,ARGUMENT,"For I should less lament even his death,"
353,ARGUMENT,"Had he among his friends at Ilium fall'n,"
354,ARGUMENT,"Or in the arms of his companions died,"
355,ARGUMENT,Troy's siege accomplish'd. Then his tomb the Greeks              300
356,ARGUMENT,"Of ev'ry tribe had built, and for his son,"
357,ARGUMENT,"He had immortal glory atchieved; but now,"
358,ARGUMENT,"By harpies torn inglorious, beyond reach"
359,ARGUMENT,Of eye or ear he lies; and hath to me
360,ARGUMENT,"Grief only, and unceasing sighs bequeath'd."
361,ARGUMENT,Nor mourn I for his sake alone; the Gods
362,ARGUMENT,Have plann'd for me still many a woe beside;
363,ARGUMENT,"For all the rulers of the neighbour isles,"
364,ARGUMENT,"Samos, Dulichium, and the forest-crown'd"
365,ARGUMENT,"Zacynthus, others also, rulers here                              310"
366,ARGUMENT,"In craggy Ithaca, my mother seek"
367,ARGUMENT,"In marriage, and my household stores consume."
368,ARGUMENT,"But neither she those nuptial rites abhorr'd,"
369,ARGUMENT,"Refuses absolute, nor yet consents"
370,ARGUMENT,To end them; they my patrimony waste
371,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, and will not long spare even me."
372,ARGUMENT,"To whom, with deep commiseration pang'd,"
373,ARGUMENT,Pallas replied. Alas! great need hast thou
374,ARGUMENT,Of thy long absent father to avenge
375,ARGUMENT,These num'rous wrongs; for could he now appear                   320
376,ARGUMENT,"There, at yon portal, arm'd with helmet, shield,"
377,ARGUMENT,"And grasping his two spears, such as when first"
378,ARGUMENT,"I saw him drinking joyous at our board,"
379,ARGUMENT,"From Ilus son of Mermeris, who dwelt"
380,ARGUMENT,"In distant Ephyre, just then return'd,"
381,ARGUMENT,(For thither also had Ulysses gone
382,ARGUMENT,"In his swift bark, seeking some pois'nous drug"
383,ARGUMENT,"Wherewith to taint his brazen arrows keen,"
384,ARGUMENT,Which drug through fear of the eternal Gods
385,ARGUMENT,"Ilus refused him, and my father free                             330"
386,ARGUMENT,"Gave to him, for he loved him past belief)"
387,ARGUMENT,"Could now, Ulysses, clad in arms as then,"
388,ARGUMENT,"Mix with these suitors, short his date of life"
389,ARGUMENT,"To each, and bitter should his nuptials prove."
390,ARGUMENT,"But these events, whether he shall return"
391,ARGUMENT,"To take just vengeance under his own roof,"
392,ARGUMENT,"Or whether not, lie all in the Gods lap."
393,ARGUMENT,"Meantime I counsel thee, thyself to think"
394,ARGUMENT,By what means likeliest thou shalt expel
395,ARGUMENT,These from thy doors. Now mark me: close attend.                 340
396,ARGUMENT,"To-morrow, summoning the Grecian Chiefs"
397,ARGUMENT,"To council, speak to them, and call the Gods"
398,ARGUMENT,To witness that solemnity. Bid go
399,ARGUMENT,"The suitors hence, each to his own abode."
400,ARGUMENT,Thy mother--if her purpose be resolved
401,ARGUMENT,"On marriage, let her to the house return"
402,ARGUMENT,"Of her own potent father, who, himself,"
403,ARGUMENT,"Shall furnish forth her matrimonial rites,"
404,ARGUMENT,"And ample dow'r, such as it well becomes"
405,ARGUMENT,"A darling daughter to receive, bestow.                           350"
406,ARGUMENT,But hear me now; thyself I thus advise.
407,ARGUMENT,"The prime of all thy ships preparing, mann'd"
408,ARGUMENT,"With twenty rowers, voyage hence to seek"
409,ARGUMENT,Intelligence of thy long-absent Sire.
410,ARGUMENT,"Some mortal may inform thee, or a word,[4]"
411,ARGUMENT,"Perchance, by Jove directed (safest source"
412,ARGUMENT,Of notice to mankind) may reach thine ear.
413,ARGUMENT,"First voyaging to Pylus, there enquire"
414,ARGUMENT,"Of noble Nestor; thence to Sparta tend,"
415,ARGUMENT,"To question Menelaus amber-hair'd,                               360"
416,ARGUMENT,Latest arrived of all the host of Greece.
417,ARGUMENT,"There should'st thou learn that still thy father lives,"
418,ARGUMENT,"And hope of his return, although"
419,ARGUMENT,"Distress'd, thou wilt be patient yet a year."
420,ARGUMENT,But should'st thou there hear tidings that he breathes
421,ARGUMENT,"No longer, to thy native isle return'd,"
422,ARGUMENT,First heap his tomb; then with such pomp perform
423,ARGUMENT,"His funeral rites as his great name demands,"
424,ARGUMENT,"And make thy mother's spousals, next, thy care."
425,ARGUMENT,"These duties satisfied, delib'rate last                          370"
426,ARGUMENT,Whether thou shalt these troublers of thy house
427,ARGUMENT,"By stratagem, or by assault, destroy."
428,ARGUMENT,"For thou art now no child, nor longer may'st"
429,ARGUMENT,Sport like one. Hast thou not the proud report
430,ARGUMENT,"Heard, how Orestes hath renown acquired"
431,ARGUMENT,"With all mankind, his father's murtherer"
432,ARGUMENT,"Ægisthus slaying, the deceiver base"
433,ARGUMENT,Who slaughter'd Agamemnon? Oh my friend!
434,ARGUMENT,"(For with delight thy vig'rous growth I view,"
435,ARGUMENT,"And just proportion) be thou also bold,                          380"
436,ARGUMENT,And merit praise from ages yet to come.
437,ARGUMENT,"But I will to my vessel now repair,"
438,ARGUMENT,"And to my mariners, whom, absent long,"
439,ARGUMENT,I may perchance have troubled. Weigh thou well
440,ARGUMENT,My counsel; let not my advice be lost.
441,ARGUMENT,To whom Telemachus discrete replied.
442,ARGUMENT,"Stranger! thy words bespeak thee much my friend,"
443,ARGUMENT,"Who, as a father teaches his own son,"
444,ARGUMENT,"Hast taught me, and I never will forget."
445,ARGUMENT,"But, though in haste thy voyage to pursue,                       390"
446,ARGUMENT,"Yet stay, that in the bath refreshing first"
447,ARGUMENT,"Thy limbs now weary, thou may'st sprightlier seek"
448,ARGUMENT,"Thy gallant bark, charged with some noble gift"
449,ARGUMENT,"Of finish'd workmanship, which thou shalt keep"
450,ARGUMENT,As my memorial ever; such a boon
451,ARGUMENT,As men confer on guests whom much they love.
452,ARGUMENT,"Then Pallas thus, Goddess cærulean-eyed."
453,ARGUMENT,"Retard me not, for go I must; the gift"
454,ARGUMENT,"Which liberal thou desirest to bestow,"
455,ARGUMENT,"Give me at my return, that I may bear                            400"
456,ARGUMENT,"The treasure home; and, in exchange, thyself"
457,ARGUMENT,Expect some gift equivalent from me.
458,ARGUMENT,"She spake, and as with eagle-wings upborne,"
459,ARGUMENT,"Vanish'd incontinent, but him inspired"
460,ARGUMENT,"With daring fortitude, and on his heart"
461,ARGUMENT,Dearer remembrance of his Sire impress'd
462,ARGUMENT,"Than ever. Conscious of the wond'rous change,"
463,ARGUMENT,"Amazed he stood, and, in his secret thought"
464,ARGUMENT,"Revolving all, believed his guest a God."
465,ARGUMENT,The youthful Hero to the suitors then                            410
466,ARGUMENT,"Repair'd; they silent, listen'd to the song"
467,ARGUMENT,Of the illustrious Bard: he the return
468,ARGUMENT,Deplorable of the Achaian host
469,ARGUMENT,"From Ilium by command of Pallas, sang."
470,ARGUMENT,"Penelope, Icarius' daughter, mark'd"
471,ARGUMENT,"Meantime the song celestial, where she sat"
472,ARGUMENT,"In the superior palace; down she came,"
473,ARGUMENT,By all the num'rous steps of her abode;
474,ARGUMENT,"Not sole, for two fair handmaids follow'd her."
475,ARGUMENT,"She then, divinest of her sex, arrived                           420"
476,ARGUMENT,"In presence of that lawless throng, beneath"
477,ARGUMENT,"The portal of her stately mansion stood,"
478,ARGUMENT,"Between her maidens, with her lucid veil"
479,ARGUMENT,"Her lovely features mantling. There, profuse"
480,ARGUMENT,"She wept, and thus the sacred bard bespake."
481,ARGUMENT,Phemius! for many a sorrow-soothing strain
482,ARGUMENT,"Thou know'st beside, such as exploits record"
483,ARGUMENT,"Of Gods and men, the poet's frequent theme;"
484,ARGUMENT,"Give them of those a song, and let themselves"
485,ARGUMENT,Their wine drink noiseless; but this mournful strain             430
486,ARGUMENT,"Break off, unfriendly to my bosom's peace,"
487,ARGUMENT,"And which of all hearts nearest touches mine,"
488,ARGUMENT,"With such regret my dearest Lord I mourn,"
489,ARGUMENT,Rememb'ring still an husband praised from side
490,ARGUMENT,"To side, and in the very heart of Greece."
491,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus Telemachus return'd.
492,ARGUMENT,My mother! wherefore should it give thee pain
493,ARGUMENT,If the delightful bard that theme pursue
494,ARGUMENT,To which he feels his mind impell'd? the bard
495,ARGUMENT,"Blame not, but rather Jove, who, as he wills,                    440"
496,ARGUMENT,Materials for poetic art supplies.
497,ARGUMENT,"No fault is his, if the disastrous fate"
498,ARGUMENT,"He sing of the Achaians, for the song"
499,ARGUMENT,Wins ever from the hearers most applause
500,ARGUMENT,That has been least in use. Of all who fought
501,ARGUMENT,"At Troy, Ulysses hath not lost, alone,"
502,ARGUMENT,His day of glad return; but many a Chief
503,ARGUMENT,Hath perish'd also. Seek thou then again
504,ARGUMENT,"Thy own apartment, spindle ply and loom,"
505,ARGUMENT,And task thy maidens; management belongs                         450
506,ARGUMENT,"To men of joys convivial, and of men"
507,ARGUMENT,"Especially to me, chief ruler here."
508,ARGUMENT,She heard astonish'd; and the prudent speech
509,ARGUMENT,"Reposing of her son deep in her heart,"
510,ARGUMENT,Again with her attendant maidens sought
511,ARGUMENT,"Her upper chamber. There arrived, she wept"
512,ARGUMENT,"Her lost Ulysses, till Minerva bathed"
513,ARGUMENT,Her weary lids in dewy sleep profound.
514,ARGUMENT,Then echoed through the palace dark-bedimm'd
515,ARGUMENT,"With evening shades the suitors boist'rous roar,                 460"
516,ARGUMENT,"For each the royal bed burn'd to partake,"
517,ARGUMENT,Whom thus Telemachus discrete address'd.
518,ARGUMENT,"All ye my mother's suitors, though addict"
519,ARGUMENT,"To contumacious wrangling fierce, suspend"
520,ARGUMENT,"Your clamour, for a course to me it seems"
521,ARGUMENT,"More decent far, when such a bard as this,"
522,ARGUMENT,"Godlike, for sweetness, sings, to hear his song."
523,ARGUMENT,"To-morrow meet we in full council all,"
524,ARGUMENT,That I may plainly warn you to depart
525,ARGUMENT,From this our mansion. Seek ye where ye may                      470
526,ARGUMENT,Your feasts; consume your own; alternate feed
527,ARGUMENT,Each at the other's cost; but if it seem
528,ARGUMENT,"Wisest in your account and best, to eat"
529,ARGUMENT,Voracious thus the patrimonial goods
530,ARGUMENT,"Of one man, rend'ring no account of all,[5]"
531,ARGUMENT,Bite to the roots; but know that I will cry
532,ARGUMENT,"Ceaseless to the eternal Gods, in hope"
533,ARGUMENT,"That Jove, for retribution of the wrong,"
534,ARGUMENT,"Shall doom you, where ye have intruded, there"
535,ARGUMENT,"To bleed, and of your blood ask no account.[5]                   480"
536,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and each gnaw'd his lip, aghast"
537,ARGUMENT,At his undaunted hardiness of speech.
538,ARGUMENT,"Then thus Antinoüs spake, Eupithes' son."
539,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus! the Gods, methinks, themselves"
540,ARGUMENT,"Teach thee sublimity, and to pronounce"
541,ARGUMENT,"Thy matter fearless. Ah forbid it, Jove!"
542,ARGUMENT,That one so eloquent should with the weight
543,ARGUMENT,"Of kingly cares in Ithaca be charged,"
544,ARGUMENT,"A realm, by claim hereditary, thine."
545,ARGUMENT,Then prudent thus Telemachus replied.                          490
546,ARGUMENT,"Although my speech Antinoüs may, perchance,"
547,ARGUMENT,"Provoke thee, know that I am not averse"
548,ARGUMENT,"From kingly cares, if Jove appoint me such."
549,ARGUMENT,Seems it to thee a burthen to be fear'd
550,ARGUMENT,"By men above all others? trust me, no,"
551,ARGUMENT,There is no ill in royalty; the man
552,ARGUMENT,"So station'd, waits not long ere he obtain"
553,ARGUMENT,Riches and honour. But I grant that Kings
554,ARGUMENT,Of the Achaians may no few be found
555,ARGUMENT,"In sea-girt Ithaca both young and old,                           500"
556,ARGUMENT,"Of whom since great Ulysses is no more,"
557,ARGUMENT,"Reign whoso may; but King, myself, I am"
558,ARGUMENT,"In my own house, and over all my own"
559,ARGUMENT,"Domestics, by Ulysses gained for me."
560,ARGUMENT,"To whom Eurymachus replied, the son"
561,ARGUMENT,Of Polybus. What Grecian Chief shall reign
562,ARGUMENT,"In sea-girt Ithaca, must be referr'd"
563,ARGUMENT,"To the Gods' will, Telemachus! meantime"
564,ARGUMENT,Thou hast unquestionable right to keep
565,ARGUMENT,"Thy own, and to command in thy own house.                        510"
566,ARGUMENT,"May never that man on her shores arrive,"
567,ARGUMENT,While an inhabitant shall yet be left
568,ARGUMENT,"In Ithaca, who shall by violence wrest"
569,ARGUMENT,"Thine from thee. But permit me, noble Sir!"
570,ARGUMENT,To ask thee of thy guest. Whence came the man?
571,ARGUMENT,What country claims him? Where are to be found
572,ARGUMENT,His kindred and his patrimonial fields?
573,ARGUMENT,Brings he glad tidings of thy Sire's approach
574,ARGUMENT,Homeward? or came he to receive a debt
575,ARGUMENT,Due to himself? How swift he disappear'd!                        520
576,ARGUMENT,Nor opportunity to know him gave
577,ARGUMENT,To those who wish'd it; for his face and air
578,ARGUMENT,Him speak not of Plebeian birth obscure.
579,ARGUMENT,Whom answered thus Telemachus discrete.
580,ARGUMENT,Eurymachus! my father comes no more.
581,ARGUMENT,"I can no longer now tidings believe,"
582,ARGUMENT,If such arrive; nor he'd I more the song
583,ARGUMENT,Of sooth-sayers whom my mother may consult.
584,ARGUMENT,But this my guest hath known in other days
585,ARGUMENT,"My father, and he came from Taphos, son                          530"
586,ARGUMENT,"Of brave Anchialus, Mentes by name,"
587,ARGUMENT,And Chief of the sea-practis'd Taphian race.
588,ARGUMENT,"So spake Telemachus, but in his heart"
589,ARGUMENT,Knew well his guest a Goddess from the skies.
590,ARGUMENT,Then they to dance and heart-enlivening song
591,ARGUMENT,"Turn'd joyous, waiting the approach of eve,"
592,ARGUMENT,And dusky evening found them joyous still.
593,ARGUMENT,"Then each, to his own house retiring, sought"
594,ARGUMENT,Needful repose. Meantime Telemachus
595,ARGUMENT,"To his own lofty chamber, built in view                          540"
596,ARGUMENT,"Of the wide hall, retired; but with a heart"
597,ARGUMENT,In various musings occupied intense.
598,ARGUMENT,"Sage Euryclea, bearing in each hand"
599,ARGUMENT,"A torch, preceded him; her sire was Ops,"
600,ARGUMENT,"Pisenor's son, and, in her early prime,"
601,ARGUMENT,"At his own cost Laertes made her his,"
602,ARGUMENT,"Paying with twenty beeves her purchase-price,"
603,ARGUMENT,Nor in less honour than his spotless wife
604,ARGUMENT,"He held her ever, but his consort's wrath"
605,ARGUMENT,"Fearing, at no time call'd her to his bed.                       550"
606,ARGUMENT,"She bore the torches, and with truer heart"
607,ARGUMENT,"Loved him than any of the female train,"
608,ARGUMENT,For she had nurs'd him in his infant years.
609,ARGUMENT,"He open'd his broad chamber-valves, and sat"
610,ARGUMENT,On his couch-side: then putting off his vest
611,ARGUMENT,"Of softest texture, placed it in the hands"
612,ARGUMENT,"Of the attendant dame discrete, who first"
613,ARGUMENT,"Folding it with exactest care, beside"
614,ARGUMENT,"His bed suspended it, and, going forth,"
615,ARGUMENT,"Drew by its silver ring the portal close,                        560"
616,ARGUMENT,And fasten'd it with bolt and brace secure.
617,ARGUMENT,"There lay Telemachus, on finest wool"
618,ARGUMENT,"Reposed, contemplating all night his course"
619,ARGUMENT,Prescribed by Pallas to the Pylian shore.

655,ARGUMENT,"from whom, having informed them of his design to undertake a voyage in"

721,ARGUMENT,"Benign their children, govern'd once yourselves;                  60"
722,ARGUMENT,"The other, and the more alarming ill,"
723,ARGUMENT,"With ruin threatens my whole house, and all"
724,ARGUMENT,My patrimony with immediate waste.
725,ARGUMENT,"Suitors, (their children who in this our isle"
726,ARGUMENT,Hold highest rank) importunate besiege

738,ARGUMENT,"Ourselves are not sufficient; we, alas!"
739,ARGUMENT,"Too feeble should be found, and yet to learn"

741,ARGUMENT,"Else, had I pow'r, I would, myself, redress                       80"

761,ARGUMENT,"I might obtain, perchance, righteous amends                      100"
762,ARGUMENT,Hereafter; you I might with vehement suit

770,ARGUMENT,"Long time, none dared to greet Telemachus"
771,ARGUMENT,"With answer rough, till of them all, at last,                    110"
772,ARGUMENT,"Antinoüs, sole arising, thus replied."
773,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, intemp'rate in harangue,"
774,ARGUMENT,High-sounding orator! it is thy drift
775,ARGUMENT,To make us all odious; but the offence
776,ARGUMENT,Lies not with us the suitors; she alone
777,ARGUMENT,"Thy mother, who in subtlety excels,"
778,ARGUMENT,"And deep-wrought subterfuge, deserves the blame."
779,ARGUMENT,"It is already the third year, and soon"
780,ARGUMENT,"Shall be the fourth, since with delusive art"
781,ARGUMENT,"Practising on their minds, she hath deceived                     120"
782,ARGUMENT,The Greecians; message after message sent
783,ARGUMENT,"Brings hope to each, by turns, and promise fair,"
784,ARGUMENT,"But she, meantime, far otherwise intends."
785,ARGUMENT,"Her other arts exhausted all, she framed"
786,ARGUMENT,This stratagem; a web of amplest size
787,ARGUMENT,"And subtlest woof beginning, thus she spake."
788,ARGUMENT,"Princes, my suitors! since the noble Chief"
789,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses is no more, press not as yet"
790,ARGUMENT,"My nuptials, wait till I shall finish, first,"
791,ARGUMENT,A fun'ral robe (lest all my threads decay)                       130
792,ARGUMENT,"Which for the antient Hero I prepare,"
793,ARGUMENT,"Laertes, looking for the mournful hour"
794,ARGUMENT,When fate shall snatch him to eternal rest;
795,ARGUMENT,"Else I the censure dread of all my sex,"
796,ARGUMENT,"Should he, so wealthy, want at last a shroud."
797,ARGUMENT,"So spake the Queen, and unsuspicious, we"
798,ARGUMENT,"With her request complied. Thenceforth, all day"
799,ARGUMENT,"She wove the ample web, and by the aid"
800,ARGUMENT,Of torches ravell'd it again at night.
801,ARGUMENT,Three years by such contrivance she deceived                     140
802,ARGUMENT,The Greecians; but when (three whole years elaps'd)
803,ARGUMENT,"The fourth arriv'd, then, conscious of the fraud,"
804,ARGUMENT,"A damsel of her train told all the truth,"
805,ARGUMENT,And her we found rav'ling the beauteous work.
806,ARGUMENT,"Thus, through necessity she hath, at length,"
807,ARGUMENT,"Perform'd the task, and in her own despight."
808,ARGUMENT,"Now therefore, for the information clear"
809,ARGUMENT,"Of thee thyself, and of the other Greeks,"
810,ARGUMENT,"We answer. Send thy mother hence, with charge"
811,ARGUMENT,That him she wed on whom her father's choice                     150
812,ARGUMENT,"Shall fall, and whom she shall, herself, approve."
813,ARGUMENT,But if by long procrastination still
814,ARGUMENT,"She persevere wearing our patience out,"
815,ARGUMENT,Attentive only to display the gifts
816,ARGUMENT,"By Pallas so profusely dealt to her,"
817,ARGUMENT,"Works of surpassing skill, ingenious thought,"
818,ARGUMENT,"And subtle shifts, such as no beauteous Greek"
819,ARGUMENT,(For aught that we have heard) in antient times
820,ARGUMENT,"E'er practised, Tyro, or Alcemena fair,"
821,ARGUMENT,"Or fair Mycene, of whom none in art                              160"
822,ARGUMENT,"E'er match'd Penelope, although we yield"
823,ARGUMENT,"To this her last invention little praise,"
824,ARGUMENT,"Then know, that these her suitors will consume"
825,ARGUMENT,"So long thy patrimony and thy goods,"
826,ARGUMENT,"As she her present purpose shall indulge,"
827,ARGUMENT,With which the Gods inspire her. Great renown
828,ARGUMENT,"She to herself insures, but equal woe"
829,ARGUMENT,And devastation of thy wealth to thee;
830,ARGUMENT,For neither to our proper works at home
831,ARGUMENT,"Go we, of that be sure, nor yet elsewhere,                       170"
832,ARGUMENT,"Till him she wed, to whom she most inclines."
833,ARGUMENT,"Him prudent, then, answer'd Telemachus."
834,ARGUMENT,Antinoüs! it is not possible
835,ARGUMENT,"That I should thrust her forth against her will,"
836,ARGUMENT,"Who both produced and reared me. Be he dead,"
837,ARGUMENT,"Or still alive, my Sire is far remote,"
838,ARGUMENT,"And should I, voluntary, hence dismiss"
839,ARGUMENT,"My mother to Icarius, I must much"
840,ARGUMENT,"Refund, which hardship were and loss to me."
841,ARGUMENT,"So doing, I should also wrath incur                              180"
842,ARGUMENT,"From my offended Sire, and from the Gods"
843,ARGUMENT,"Still more; for she, departing, would invoke"
844,ARGUMENT,"Erynnis to avenge her, and reproach"
845,ARGUMENT,Beside would follow me from all mankind.
846,ARGUMENT,"That word I, therefore, never will pronounce."
847,ARGUMENT,"No, if ye judge your treatment at her hands"
848,ARGUMENT,"Injurious to you, go ye forth yourselves,"
849,ARGUMENT,Forsake my mansion; seek where else ye may
850,ARGUMENT,Your feasts; consume your own; alternate feed
851,ARGUMENT,Each at the other's cost. But if it seem                         190
852,ARGUMENT,Wisest in your account and best to eat
853,ARGUMENT,Voracious thus the patrimonial goods
854,ARGUMENT,"Of one man, rend'ring no account of all,"
855,ARGUMENT,Bite to the roots; but know that I will cry
856,ARGUMENT,"Ceaseless to the eternal Gods, in hope"
857,ARGUMENT,"That Jove, in retribution of the wrong,"
858,ARGUMENT,"Shall doom you, where ye have intruded, there"
859,ARGUMENT,"To bleed, and of your blood ask no account."
860,ARGUMENT,"So spake Telemachus, and while he spake,"
861,ARGUMENT,The Thund'rer from a lofty mountain-top                          200
862,ARGUMENT,"Turn'd off two eagles; on the winds, awhile,"
863,ARGUMENT,With outspread pinions ample side by side
864,ARGUMENT,"They floated; but, ere long, hov'ring aloft,"
865,ARGUMENT,Right o'er the midst of the assembled Chiefs
866,ARGUMENT,"They wheel'd around, clang'd all their num'rous plumes,"
867,ARGUMENT,"And with a downward look eyeing the throng,"
868,ARGUMENT,"Death boded, ominous; then rending each"
869,ARGUMENT,"The other's face and neck, they sprang at once"
870,ARGUMENT,"Toward the right, and darted through the town."
871,ARGUMENT,"Amazement universal, at that sight,                              210"
872,ARGUMENT,"Seized the assembly, and with anxious thought"
873,ARGUMENT,Each scann'd the future; amidst whom arose
874,ARGUMENT,"The Hero Halitherses, antient Seer,"
875,ARGUMENT,Offspring of Mastor; for in judgment he
876,ARGUMENT,"Of portents augural, and in forecast"
877,ARGUMENT,"Unerring, his coevals all excell'd,"
878,ARGUMENT,And prudent thus the multitude bespake.
879,ARGUMENT,"Ye men of Ithaca, give ear! hear all!"
880,ARGUMENT,"Though chief my speech shall to the suitors look,"
881,ARGUMENT,"For, on their heads devolved, comes down the woe.                220"
882,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses shall not from his friends, henceforth,"
883,ARGUMENT,"Live absent long, but, hasting to his home,"
884,ARGUMENT,"Comes even now, and as he comes, designs"
885,ARGUMENT,"A bloody death for these, whose bitter woes"
886,ARGUMENT,"No few shall share, inhabitants with us"
887,ARGUMENT,Of pleasant Ithaca; but let us frame
888,ARGUMENT,Effectual means maturely to suppress
889,ARGUMENT,"Their violent deeds, or rather let themselves"
890,ARGUMENT,Repentant cease; and soonest shall be best.
891,ARGUMENT,"Not inexpert, but well-inform'd I speak                          230"
892,ARGUMENT,"The future, and the accomplishment announce"
893,ARGUMENT,Of all which when Ulysses with the Greeks
894,ARGUMENT,"Embark'd for Troy, I to himself foretold."
895,ARGUMENT,"I said that, after many woes, and loss"
896,ARGUMENT,"Of all his people, in the twentieth year,"
897,ARGUMENT,"Unknown to all, he should regain his home,"
898,ARGUMENT,And my prediction shall be now fulfill'd.
899,ARGUMENT,"Him, then, Eurymachus thus answer'd rough"
900,ARGUMENT,"The son of Polybus. Hence to thy house,"
901,ARGUMENT,"Thou hoary dotard! there, prophetic, teach                       240"
902,ARGUMENT,Thy children to escape woes else to come.
903,ARGUMENT,"Birds num'rous flutter in the beams of day,"
904,ARGUMENT,"Not all predictive. Death, far hence remote"
905,ARGUMENT,"Hath found Ulysses, and I would to heav'n"
906,ARGUMENT,"That, where he died, thyself had perish'd too."
907,ARGUMENT,Thou hadst not then run o'er with prophecy
908,ARGUMENT,"As now, nor provocation to the wrath"
909,ARGUMENT,"Giv'n of Telemachus, in hope to win,"
910,ARGUMENT,"Perchance, for thine some favour at his hands."
911,ARGUMENT,"But I to _thee_ foretell, skilled as thou art                    250"
912,ARGUMENT,"In legends old, (nor shall my threat be vain)"
913,ARGUMENT,That if by artifice thou move to wrath
914,ARGUMENT,"A younger than thyself, no matter whom,"
915,ARGUMENT,"Woe first the heavier on himself shall fall,"
916,ARGUMENT,"Nor shalt thou profit him by thy attempt,"
917,ARGUMENT,"And we will charge thee also with a mulct,"
918,ARGUMENT,"Which thou shalt pay with difficulty, and bear"
919,ARGUMENT,The burthen of it with an aching heart.
920,ARGUMENT,"As for Telemachus, I him advise,"
921,ARGUMENT,"Myself, and press the measure on his choice                      260"
922,ARGUMENT,"Earnestly, that he send his mother hence"
923,ARGUMENT,"To her own father's house, who shall, himself,"
924,ARGUMENT,"Set forth her nuptial rites, and shall endow"
925,ARGUMENT,"His daughter sumptuously, and as he ought."
926,ARGUMENT,"For this expensive wooing, as I judge,"
927,ARGUMENT,Till then shall never cease; since we regard
928,ARGUMENT,"No man--no--not Telemachus, although"
929,ARGUMENT,In words exub'rant; neither fear we aught
930,ARGUMENT,"Thy vain prognostics, venerable sir!"
931,ARGUMENT,But only hate thee for their sake the more.                      270
932,ARGUMENT,Waste will continue and disorder foul
933,ARGUMENT,"Unremedied, so long as she shall hold"
934,ARGUMENT,"The suitors in suspense, for, day by day,"
935,ARGUMENT,"Our emulation goads us to the strife,"
936,ARGUMENT,"Nor shall we, going hence, seek to espouse"
937,ARGUMENT,Each his own comfort suitable elsewhere.
938,ARGUMENT,"To whom, discrete, Telemachus replied."
939,ARGUMENT,"Eurymachus, and ye the suitor train"
940,ARGUMENT,"Illustrious, I have spoken: ye shall hear"
941,ARGUMENT,No more this supplication urged by me.                           280
942,ARGUMENT,"The Gods, and all the Greeks, now know the truth."
943,ARGUMENT,But give me instantly a gallant bark
944,ARGUMENT,"With twenty rowers, skill'd their course to win"
945,ARGUMENT,To whatsoever haven; for I go
946,ARGUMENT,"To sandy Pylus, and shall hasten thence"
947,ARGUMENT,"To Lacedemon, tidings to obtain"
948,ARGUMENT,"Of my long-absent Sire, or from the lips"
949,ARGUMENT,"Of man, or by a word from Jove vouchsafed"
950,ARGUMENT,"Himself, best source of notice to mankind."
951,ARGUMENT,"If, there inform'd that still my father lives,                   290"
952,ARGUMENT,"I hope conceive of his return, although"
953,ARGUMENT,"Distress'd, I shall be patient yet a year."
954,ARGUMENT,"But should I learn, haply, that he survives"
955,ARGUMENT,"No longer, then, returning, I will raise"
956,ARGUMENT,"At home his tomb, will with such pomp perform"
957,ARGUMENT,"His fun'ral rites, as his great name demands,"
958,ARGUMENT,And give my mother's hand to whom I may.
959,ARGUMENT,"This said, he sat, and after him arose"
960,ARGUMENT,"Mentor, illustrious Ulysses' friend,"
961,ARGUMENT,"To whom, embarking thence, he had consign'd                      300"
962,ARGUMENT,"All his concerns, that the old Chief might rule"
963,ARGUMENT,"His family, and keep the whole secure."
964,ARGUMENT,"Arising, thus the senior, sage, began."
965,ARGUMENT,"Hear me, ye Ithacans! be never King"
966,ARGUMENT,"Henceforth, benevolent, gracious, humane"
967,ARGUMENT,"Or righteous, but let every sceptred hand"
968,ARGUMENT,"Rule merciless, and deal in wrong alone,"
969,ARGUMENT,"Since none of all his people, whom he sway'd"
970,ARGUMENT,"With such paternal gentleness and love,"
971,ARGUMENT,Remembers the divine Ulysses more!                               310
972,ARGUMENT,That the imperious suitors thus should weave
973,ARGUMENT,"The web of mischief and atrocious wrong,"
974,ARGUMENT,I grudge not; since at hazard of their heads
975,ARGUMENT,"They make Ulysses' property a prey,"
976,ARGUMENT,Persuaded that the Hero comes no more.
977,ARGUMENT,But much the people move me; how ye sit
978,ARGUMENT,"All mute, and though a multitude, yourselves,"
979,ARGUMENT,"Opposed to few, risque not a single word"
980,ARGUMENT,To check the license of these bold intruders!
981,ARGUMENT,"Then thus Liocritus, Evenor's son.                             320"
982,ARGUMENT,Injurious Mentor! headlong orator!
983,ARGUMENT,How dar'st thou move the populace against
984,ARGUMENT,"The suitors? Trust me they should find it hard,"
985,ARGUMENT,"Numerous as they are, to cope with us,"
986,ARGUMENT,A feast the prize. Or should the King himself
987,ARGUMENT,"Of Ithaca, returning, undertake"
988,ARGUMENT,"T' expell the jovial suitors from his house,"
989,ARGUMENT,"Much as Penelope his absence mourns,"
990,ARGUMENT,His presence should afford her little joy;
991,ARGUMENT,"For fighting sole with many, he should meet                      330"
992,ARGUMENT,"A dreadful death. Thou, therefore, speak'st amiss."
993,ARGUMENT,"As for Telemachus, let Mentor him"
994,ARGUMENT,"And Halytherses furnish forth, the friends"
995,ARGUMENT,"Long valued of his Sire, with all dispatch;"
996,ARGUMENT,Though him I judge far likelier to remain
997,ARGUMENT,"Long-time contented an enquirer here,"
998,ARGUMENT,Than to perform the voyage now proposed.
999,ARGUMENT,"Thus saying, Liocritus dissolved in haste"
1000,ARGUMENT,"The council, and the scattered concourse sought"
1001,ARGUMENT,"Their sev'ral homes, while all the suitors flock'd               340"
1002,ARGUMENT,Thence to the palace of their absent King.
1003,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, Telemachus from all resort"
1004,ARGUMENT,"Retiring, in the surf of the gray Deep"
1005,ARGUMENT,"First laved his hands, then, thus to Pallas pray'd."
1006,ARGUMENT,O Goddess! who wast yesterday a guest
1007,ARGUMENT,"Beneath my roof, and didst enjoin me then"
1008,ARGUMENT,A voyage o'er the sable Deep in quest
1009,ARGUMENT,Of tidings of my long regretted Sire!
1010,ARGUMENT,"Which voyage, all in Ithaca, but most"
1011,ARGUMENT,"The haughty suitors, obstinate impede,                           350"
1012,ARGUMENT,Now hear my suit and gracious interpose!
1013,ARGUMENT,"Such pray'r he made; then Pallas, in the form,"
1014,ARGUMENT,"And with the voice of Mentor, drawing nigh,"
1015,ARGUMENT,"In accents wing'd, him kindly thus bespake."
1016,ARGUMENT,Telemachus! thou shalt hereafter prove
1017,ARGUMENT,"Nor base, nor poor in talents. If, in truth,"
1018,ARGUMENT,Thou have received from heav'n thy father's force
1019,ARGUMENT,"Instill'd into thee, and resemblest him"
1020,ARGUMENT,"In promptness both of action and of speech,"
1021,ARGUMENT,"Thy voyage shall not useless be, or vain.                        360"
1022,ARGUMENT,But if Penelope produced thee not
1023,ARGUMENT,"His son, I, then, hope not for good effect"
1024,ARGUMENT,"Of this design which, ardent, thou pursuest."
1025,ARGUMENT,Few sons their fathers equal; most appear
1026,ARGUMENT,"Degenerate; but we find, though rare, sometimes"
1027,ARGUMENT,A son superior even to his Sire.
1028,ARGUMENT,And since thyself shalt neither base be found
1029,ARGUMENT,"Nor spiritless, nor altogether void"
1030,ARGUMENT,"Of talents, such as grace thy royal Sire,"
1031,ARGUMENT,I therefore hope success of thy attempt.                         370
1032,ARGUMENT,Heed not the suitors' projects; neither wise
1033,ARGUMENT,"Are they, nor just, nor aught suspect the doom"
1034,ARGUMENT,"Which now approaches them, and in one day"
1035,ARGUMENT,Shall overwhelm them all. No long suspense
1036,ARGUMENT,"Shall hold thy purposed enterprise in doubt,"
1037,ARGUMENT,"Such help from me, of old thy father's friend,"
1038,ARGUMENT,"Thou shalt receive, who with a bark well-oar'd"
1039,ARGUMENT,"Will serve thee, and myself attend thee forth."
1040,ARGUMENT,"But haste, join thou the suitors, and provide,"
1041,ARGUMENT,"In sep'rate vessels stow'd, all needful stores,                  380"
1042,ARGUMENT,"Wine in thy jars, and flour, the strength of man,"
1043,ARGUMENT,"In skins close-seam'd. I will, meantime, select"
1044,ARGUMENT,Such as shall voluntary share thy toils.
1045,ARGUMENT,In sea-girt Ithaca new ships and old
1046,ARGUMENT,"Abound, and I will chuse, myself, for thee"
1047,ARGUMENT,"The prime of all, which without more delay"
1048,ARGUMENT,We will launch out into the spacious Deep.
1049,ARGUMENT,"Thus Pallas spake, daughter of Jove; nor long,"
1050,ARGUMENT,"So greeted by the voice divine, remain'd"
1051,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, but to his palace went                               390"
1052,ARGUMENT,Distress'd in heart. He found the suitors there
1053,ARGUMENT,"Goats slaying in the hall, and fatted swine"
1054,ARGUMENT,Roasting; when with a laugh Antinoüs flew
1055,ARGUMENT,"To meet him, fasten'd on his hand, and said,"
1056,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, in eloquence sublime,"
1057,ARGUMENT,And of a spirit not to be controul'd!
1058,ARGUMENT,Give harbour in thy breast on no account
1059,ARGUMENT,"To after-grudge or enmity, but eat,"
1060,ARGUMENT,"Far rather, cheerfully as heretofore,"
1061,ARGUMENT,"And freely drink, committing all thy cares                       400"
1062,ARGUMENT,"To the Achaians, who shall furnish forth"
1063,ARGUMENT,"A gallant ship and chosen crew for thee,"
1064,ARGUMENT,"That thou may'st hence to Pylus with all speed,"
1065,ARGUMENT,Tidings to learn of thy illustrious Sire.
1066,ARGUMENT,"To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied."
1067,ARGUMENT,Antinoüs! I have no heart to feast
1068,ARGUMENT,"With guests so insolent, nor can indulge"
1069,ARGUMENT,"The pleasures of a mind at ease, with you."
1070,ARGUMENT,"Is't not enough, suitors, that ye have used"
1071,ARGUMENT,My noble patrimony as your own                                   410
1072,ARGUMENT,"While I was yet a child? now, grown mature,"
1073,ARGUMENT,And competent to understand the speech
1074,ARGUMENT,"Of my instructors, feeling, too, a mind"
1075,ARGUMENT,"Within me conscious of augmented pow'rs,"
1076,ARGUMENT,"I will attempt your ruin, be assured,"
1077,ARGUMENT,"Whether at Pylus, or continuing here."
1078,ARGUMENT,"I go, indeed, (nor shall my voyage prove"
1079,ARGUMENT,"Of which I speak, bootless or vain) I go"
1080,ARGUMENT,"An humble passenger, who neither bark"
1081,ARGUMENT,"Nor rowers have to boast my own, denied                          420"
1082,ARGUMENT,That honour (so ye judg'd it best) by you.
1083,ARGUMENT,"He said, and from Antinoüs' hand his own"
1084,ARGUMENT,Drew sudden. Then their delicate repast
1085,ARGUMENT,"The busy suitors on all sides prepar'd,"
1086,ARGUMENT,"Still taunting as they toil'd, and with sharp speech"
1087,ARGUMENT,"Sarcastic wantoning, of whom a youth,"
1088,ARGUMENT,"Arrogant as his fellows, thus began."
1089,ARGUMENT,"I see it plain, Telemachus intends"
1090,ARGUMENT,Our slaughter; either he will aids procure
1091,ARGUMENT,"From sandy Pylus, or will bring them arm'd                       430"
1092,ARGUMENT,From Sparta; such is his tremendous drift.
1093,ARGUMENT,"Even to fruitful Ephyre, perchance,"
1094,ARGUMENT,"He will proceed, seeking some baneful herb"
1095,ARGUMENT,"Which cast into our cup, shall drug us all."
1096,ARGUMENT,To whom some haughty suitor thus replied.
1097,ARGUMENT,"Who knows but that himself, wand'ring the sea"
1098,ARGUMENT,"From all his friends and kindred far remote,"
1099,ARGUMENT,May perish like Ulysses? Whence to us
1100,ARGUMENT,"Should double toil ensue, on whom the charge"
1101,ARGUMENT,"To parcel out his wealth would then devolve,                     440"
1102,ARGUMENT,And to endow his mother with the house
1103,ARGUMENT,For his abode whom she should chance to wed.
1104,ARGUMENT,"So sported they; but he, ascending sought"
1105,ARGUMENT,"His father's lofty chamber, where his heaps"
1106,ARGUMENT,"He kept of brass and gold, garments in chests,"
1107,ARGUMENT,"And oils of fragrant scent, a copious store."
1108,ARGUMENT,There many a cask with season'd nectar fill'd
1109,ARGUMENT,"The grape's pure juice divine, beside the wall"
1110,ARGUMENT,"Stood orderly arranged, waiting the hour"
1111,ARGUMENT,"(Should e'er such hour arrive) when, after woes                  450"
1112,ARGUMENT,"Num'rous, Ulysses should regain his home."
1113,ARGUMENT,Secure that chamber was with folding doors
1114,ARGUMENT,"Of massy planks compact, and night and day,"
1115,ARGUMENT,"Within it antient Euryclea dwelt,"
1116,ARGUMENT,"Guardian discrete of all the treasures there,"
1117,ARGUMENT,"Whom, thither call'd, Telemachus address'd."
1118,ARGUMENT,"Nurse! draw me forth sweet wine into my jars,"
1119,ARGUMENT,Delicious next to that which thou reserv'st
1120,ARGUMENT,For our poor wand'rer; if escaping death
1121,ARGUMENT,"At last, divine Ulysses e'er return.                             460"
1122,ARGUMENT,"Fill twelve, and stop them close; pour also meal"
1123,ARGUMENT,Well mill'd (full twenty measures) into skins
1124,ARGUMENT,"Close-seam'd, and mention what thou dost to none."
1125,ARGUMENT,Place them together; for at even-tide
1126,ARGUMENT,"I will convey them hence, soon as the Queen,"
1127,ARGUMENT,"Retiring to her couch, shall seek repose."
1128,ARGUMENT,"For hence to Sparta will I take my course,"
1129,ARGUMENT,"And sandy Pylus, tidings there to hear"
1130,ARGUMENT,(If hear I may) of my lov'd Sire's return.
1131,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd, then wept his gentle nurse that sound                 470"
1132,ARGUMENT,"Hearing, and in wing'd accents thus replied."
1133,ARGUMENT,"My child! ah, wherefore hath a thought so rash"
1134,ARGUMENT,"Possess'd thee? whither, only and belov'd,"
1135,ARGUMENT,"Seek'st thou to ramble, travelling, alas!"
1136,ARGUMENT,To distant climes? Ulysses is no more;
1137,ARGUMENT,"Dead lies the Hero in some land unknown,"
1138,ARGUMENT,"And thou no sooner shalt depart, than these"
1139,ARGUMENT,"Will plot to slay thee, and divide thy wealth."
1140,ARGUMENT,"No, stay with us who love thee. Need is none"
1141,ARGUMENT,That thou should'st on the barren Deep distress                  480
1142,ARGUMENT,"Encounter, roaming without hope or end."
1143,ARGUMENT,"Whom, prudent, thus answer'd Telemachus."
1144,ARGUMENT,"Take courage, nurse! for not without consent"
1145,ARGUMENT,Of the Immortals I have thus resolv'd.
1146,ARGUMENT,"But swear, that till eleven days be past,"
1147,ARGUMENT,"Or twelve, or, till enquiry made, she learn"
1148,ARGUMENT,"Herself my going, thou wilt not impart"
1149,ARGUMENT,"Of this my purpose to my mother's ear,"
1150,ARGUMENT,Lest all her beauties fade by grief impair'd.
1151,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and the antient matron swore                         490"
1152,ARGUMENT,"Solemnly by the Gods; which done, she fill'd"
1153,ARGUMENT,"With wine the vessels and the skins with meal,"
1154,ARGUMENT,"And he, returning, join'd the throng below."
1155,ARGUMENT,"Then Pallas, Goddess azure-eyed, her thoughts"
1156,ARGUMENT,"Elsewhere directing, all the city ranged"
1157,ARGUMENT,"In semblance of Telemachus, each man"
1158,ARGUMENT,"Exhorting, at the dusk of eve, to seek"
1159,ARGUMENT,"The gallant ship, and from Noëmon, son"
1160,ARGUMENT,"Renown'd of Phronius, ask'd, herself, a bark,"
1161,ARGUMENT,"Which soon as ask'd, he promis'd to supply.                      500"
1162,ARGUMENT,"Now set the sun, and twilight dimm'd the ways,"
1163,ARGUMENT,"When, drawing down his bark into the Deep,"
1164,ARGUMENT,"He gave her all her furniture, oars, arms"
1165,ARGUMENT,"And tackle, such as well-built galleys bear,"
1166,ARGUMENT,Then moor'd her in the bottom of the bay.
1167,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, his mariners in haste repair'd"
1168,ARGUMENT,"Down to the shore, for Pallas urged them on."
1169,ARGUMENT,"And now on other purposes intent,"
1170,ARGUMENT,"The Goddess sought the palace, where with dews"
1171,ARGUMENT,"Of slumber drenching ev'ry suitor's eye,                         510"
1172,ARGUMENT,"She fool'd the drunkard multitude, and dash'd"
1173,ARGUMENT,The goblets from their idle hands away.
1174,ARGUMENT,"They through the city reeled, happy to leave"
1175,ARGUMENT,"The dull carousal, when the slumb'rous weight"
1176,ARGUMENT,Oppressive on their eye-lids once had fall'n.
1177,ARGUMENT,"Next, Pallas azure-eyed in Mentor's form"
1178,ARGUMENT,"And with the voice of Mentor, summoning"
1179,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus abroad, him thus bespake."
1180,ARGUMENT,Telemachus! already at their oars
1181,ARGUMENT,"Sit all thy fellow-voyagers, and wait                            520"
1182,ARGUMENT,"Thy coming; linger not, but haste away."
1183,ARGUMENT,"This said, Minerva led him thence, whom he"
1184,ARGUMENT,"With nimble steps follow'd, and on the shore"
1185,ARGUMENT,"Arrived, found all his mariners prepared,"
1186,ARGUMENT,Whom thus the princely voyager address'd.
1187,ARGUMENT,"Haste, my companions! bring we down the stores"
1188,ARGUMENT,Already sorted and set forth; but nought
1189,ARGUMENT,"My mother knows, or any of her train"
1190,ARGUMENT,"Of this design, one matron sole except."
1191,ARGUMENT,"He spake, and led them; they, obedient, brought                530"
1192,ARGUMENT,"All down, and, as Ulysses' son enjoin'd,"
1193,ARGUMENT,Within the gallant bark the charge bestow'd.
1194,ARGUMENT,"Then, led by Pallas, went the prince on board,"
1195,ARGUMENT,"Where down they sat, the Goddess in the stern,"
1196,ARGUMENT,And at her side Telemachus. The crew
1197,ARGUMENT,"Cast loose the hawsers, and embarking, fill'd"
1198,ARGUMENT,The benches. Blue-eyed Pallas from the West
1199,ARGUMENT,Call'd forth propitious breezes; fresh they curled
1200,ARGUMENT,"The sable Deep, and, sounding, swept the waves."
1201,ARGUMENT,"He loud-exhorting them, his people bade                          540"
1202,ARGUMENT,"Hand, brisk, the tackle; they, obedient, reared"
1203,ARGUMENT,"The pine-tree mast, which in its socket deep"
1204,ARGUMENT,"They lodg'd, then strain'd the cordage, and with thongs"
1205,ARGUMENT,"Well-twisted, drew the shining sail aloft."
1206,ARGUMENT,"A land-breeze fill'd the canvas, and the flood"
1207,ARGUMENT,Roar'd as she went against the steady bark
1208,ARGUMENT,That ran with even course her liquid way.
1209,ARGUMENT,"The rigging, thus, of all the galley set,"
1210,ARGUMENT,"Their beakers crowning high with wine, they hail'd"
1211,ARGUMENT,"The ever-living Gods, but above all                              550"
1212,ARGUMENT,"Minerva, daughter azure-eyed of Jove."
1213,ARGUMENT,"Thus, all night long the galley, and till dawn"
1214,ARGUMENT,"Had brighten'd into day, cleaved swift the flood."

1230,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus arriving at Pylus, enquires of Nestor concerning Ulysses."
1231,ARGUMENT,Nestor relates to him all that he knows or has heard of the Greecians
1232,ARGUMENT,"since their departure from the siege of Troy, but not being able to give"
1233,ARGUMENT,"him any satisfactory account of Ulysses, refers him to Menelaus. At"
1234,ARGUMENT,"evening Minerva quits Telemachus, but discovers herself in going. Nestor"
1235,ARGUMENT,"sacrifices to the Goddess, and the solemnity ended, Telemachus sets forth"

1237,ARGUMENT,Pisistratus.

1240,ARGUMENT,"The sun, emerging from the lucid waves,"

1242,ARGUMENT,"For the inhabitants of earth and heav'n,"
1243,ARGUMENT,"When in their bark at Pylus they arrived,"
1244,ARGUMENT,City of Neleus. On the shore they found
1245,ARGUMENT,The people sacrificing; bulls they slew
1246,ARGUMENT,"Black without spot, to Neptune azure-hair'd."
1247,ARGUMENT,On ranges nine of seats they sat; each range
1248,ARGUMENT,"Received five hundred, and to each they made"
1249,ARGUMENT,Allotment equal of nine sable bulls.                              10

1251,ARGUMENT,"The entrails, those stood off'ring to the God"

1253,ARGUMENT,"Push'd right ashore, and, furling close the sails,"

1255,ARGUMENT,"Forth came Telemachus, by Pallas led,"
1256,ARGUMENT,Whom thus the Goddess azure-eyed address'd.
1257,ARGUMENT,Telemachus! there is no longer room
1258,ARGUMENT,"For bashful fear, since thou hast cross'd the flood"
1259,ARGUMENT,With purpose to enquire what land conceals                        20
1260,ARGUMENT,"Thy father, and what fate hath follow'd him."
1261,ARGUMENT,Advance at once to the equestrian Chief
1262,ARGUMENT,"Nestor, within whose bosom lies, perhaps,"
1263,ARGUMENT,Advice well worthy of thy search; entreat
1264,ARGUMENT,"Himself, that he will tell thee only truth,"
1265,ARGUMENT,"Who will not lye, for he is passing wise."
1266,ARGUMENT,To whom Telemachus discrete replied.
1267,ARGUMENT,"Ah Mentor! how can I advance, how greet"
1268,ARGUMENT,"A Chief like him, unpractis'd as I am"
1269,ARGUMENT,In manag'd phrase? Shame bids the youth beware                    30
1270,ARGUMENT,How he accosts the man of many years.
1271,ARGUMENT,"But him the Goddess answer'd azure-eyed,"
1272,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus! Thou wilt, in part, thyself"
1273,ARGUMENT,"Fit speech devise, and heav'n will give the rest;"
1274,ARGUMENT,"For thou wast neither born, nor hast been train'd"
1275,ARGUMENT,"To manhood, under unpropitious Pow'rs."
1276,ARGUMENT,"So saying, Minerva led him thence, whom he"
1277,ARGUMENT,"With nimble steps attending, soon arrived"
1278,ARGUMENT,"Among the multitude. There Nestor sat,"
1279,ARGUMENT,"And Nestor's sons, while, busily the feast                        40"
1280,ARGUMENT,"Tending, his num'rous followers roasted, some,"
1281,ARGUMENT,"The viands, some, transfix'd them with the spits."
1282,ARGUMENT,"They seeing guests arrived, together all"
1283,ARGUMENT,"Advanced, and, grasping courteously their hands,"
1284,ARGUMENT,"Invited them to sit; but first, the son"
1285,ARGUMENT,"Of Nestor, young Pisistratus, approach'd,"
1286,ARGUMENT,"Who, fast'ning on the hands of both, beside"
1287,ARGUMENT,"The banquet placed them, where the beach was spread"
1288,ARGUMENT,"With fleeces, and where Thrasymedes sat"
1289,ARGUMENT,"His brother, and the hoary Chief his Sire.                        50"
1290,ARGUMENT,To each a portion of the inner parts
1291,ARGUMENT,"He gave, then fill'd a golden cup with wine,"
1292,ARGUMENT,"Which, tasted first, he to the daughter bore"
1293,ARGUMENT,"Of Jove the Thund'rer, and her thus bespake."
1294,ARGUMENT,Oh guest! the King of Ocean now adore!
1295,ARGUMENT,For ye have chanced on Neptune's festival;
1296,ARGUMENT,"And, when thou hast, thyself, libation made"
1297,ARGUMENT,"Duly, and pray'r, deliver to thy friend"
1298,ARGUMENT,"The gen'rous juice, that he may also make"
1299,ARGUMENT,"Libation; for he, doubtless, seeks, in prayer                     60"
1300,ARGUMENT,"The Immortals, of whose favour all have need."
1301,ARGUMENT,"But, since he younger is, and with myself"
1302,ARGUMENT,"Coeval, first I give the cup to thee."
1303,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd, and to her hand consign'd the cup,"
1304,ARGUMENT,Which Pallas gladly from a youth received
1305,ARGUMENT,"So just and wise, who to herself had first"
1306,ARGUMENT,"The golden cup presented, and in pray'r"
1307,ARGUMENT,Fervent the Sov'reign of the Seas adored.
1308,ARGUMENT,"Hear, earth-encircler Neptune! O vouchsafe"
1309,ARGUMENT,To us thy suppliants the desired effect                           70
1310,ARGUMENT,"Of this our voyage; glory, first, bestow"
1311,ARGUMENT,"On Nestor and his offspring both, then grant"
1312,ARGUMENT,To all the Pylians such a gracious boon
1313,ARGUMENT,As shall requite their noble off'ring well.
1314,ARGUMENT,Grant also to Telemachus and me
1315,ARGUMENT,"To voyage hence, possess'd of what we sought"
1316,ARGUMENT,When hither in our sable bark we came.
1317,ARGUMENT,"So Pallas pray'd, and her own pray'r herself"
1318,ARGUMENT,Accomplish'd. To Telemachus she gave
1319,ARGUMENT,"The splendid goblet next, and in his turn                         80"
1320,ARGUMENT,Like pray'r Ulysses' son also preferr'd.
1321,ARGUMENT,And now (the banquet from the spits withdrawn)
1322,ARGUMENT,They next distributed sufficient share
1323,ARGUMENT,"To each, and all were sumptuously regaled."
1324,ARGUMENT,"At length, (both hunger satisfied and thirst)"
1325,ARGUMENT,"Thus Nestor, the Gerenian Chief, began."
1326,ARGUMENT,"Now with more seemliness we may enquire,"
1327,ARGUMENT,"After repast, what guests we have received."
1328,ARGUMENT,Our guests! who are ye? Whence have ye the waves
1329,ARGUMENT,Plough'd hither? Come ye to transact concerns                     90
1330,ARGUMENT,"Commercial, or at random roam the Deep"
1331,ARGUMENT,"Like pirates, who with mischief charged and woe"
1332,ARGUMENT,"To foreign States, oft hazard life themselves?"
1333,ARGUMENT,"Him answer'd, bolder now, but still discrete,"
1334,ARGUMENT,Telemachus. For Pallas had his heart
1335,ARGUMENT,"With manly courage arm'd, that he might ask"
1336,ARGUMENT,"From Nestor tidings of his absent Sire,"
1337,ARGUMENT,"And win, himself, distinction and renown."
1338,ARGUMENT,"Oh Nestor, Neleus' son, glory of Greece!"
1339,ARGUMENT,Thou askest whence we are. I tell thee whence.                   100
1340,ARGUMENT,"From Ithaca, by the umbrageous woods"
1341,ARGUMENT,"Of Neritus o'erhung, by private need,"
1342,ARGUMENT,"Not public, urged, we come. My errand is"
1343,ARGUMENT,To seek intelligence of the renown'd
1344,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses; of my noble father, prais'd"
1345,ARGUMENT,"For dauntless courage, whom report proclaims"
1346,ARGUMENT,"Conqueror, with thine aid, of sacred Troy."
1347,ARGUMENT,We have already learn'd where other Chiefs
1348,ARGUMENT,"Who fought at Ilium, died; but Jove conceals"
1349,ARGUMENT,Even the death of my illustrious Sire                            110
1350,ARGUMENT,In dull obscurity; for none hath heard
1351,ARGUMENT,"Or confident can answer, where he dy'd;"
1352,ARGUMENT,Whether he on the continent hath fall'n
1353,ARGUMENT,"By hostile hands, or by the waves o'erwhelm'd"
1354,ARGUMENT,"Of Amphitrite, welters in the Deep."
1355,ARGUMENT,"For this cause, at thy knees suppliant, I beg"
1356,ARGUMENT,"That thou would'st tell me his disast'rous end,"
1357,ARGUMENT,If either thou beheld'st that dread event
1358,ARGUMENT,"Thyself, or from some wanderer of the Greeks"
1359,ARGUMENT,Hast heard it: for my father at his birth                        120
1360,ARGUMENT,"Was, sure, predestin'd to no common woes."
1361,ARGUMENT,"Neither through pity, or o'erstrain'd respect"
1362,ARGUMENT,"Flatter me, but explicit all relate"
1363,ARGUMENT,Which thou hast witness'd. If my noble Sire
1364,ARGUMENT,E'er gratified thee by performance just
1365,ARGUMENT,"Of word or deed at Ilium, where ye fell"
1366,ARGUMENT,"So num'rous slain in fight, oh, recollect"
1367,ARGUMENT,"Now his fidelity, and tell me true."
1368,ARGUMENT,Then Nestor thus Gerenian Hero old.
1369,ARGUMENT,"Young friend! since thou remind'st me, speaking thus,            130"
1370,ARGUMENT,Of all the woes which indefatigable
1371,ARGUMENT,"We sons of the Achaians there sustain'd,"
1372,ARGUMENT,Both those which wand'ring on the Deep we bore
1373,ARGUMENT,Wherever by Achilles led in quest
1374,ARGUMENT,"Of booty, and the many woes beside"
1375,ARGUMENT,Which under royal Priam's spacious walls
1376,ARGUMENT,"We suffer'd, know, that there our bravest fell."
1377,ARGUMENT,"There warlike Ajax lies, there Peleus' son;"
1378,ARGUMENT,"There, too, Patroclus, like the Gods themselves"
1379,ARGUMENT,"In council, and my son beloved there,                            140"
1380,ARGUMENT,"Brave, virtuous, swift of foot, and bold in fight,"
1381,ARGUMENT,Antilochus. Nor are these sorrows all;
1382,ARGUMENT,What tongue of mortal man could all relate?
1383,ARGUMENT,"Should'st thou, abiding here, five years employ"
1384,ARGUMENT,"Or six, enquiring of the woes endured"
1385,ARGUMENT,"By the Achaians, ere thou should'st have learn'd"
1386,ARGUMENT,"The whole, thou would'st depart, tir'd of the tale."
1387,ARGUMENT,"For we, nine years, stratagems of all kinds"
1388,ARGUMENT,"Devised against them, and Saturnian Jove"
1389,ARGUMENT,Scarce crown'd the difficult attempt at last.                    150
1390,ARGUMENT,"There, no competitor in wiles well-plann'd"
1391,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses found, so far were all surpass'd"
1392,ARGUMENT,"In shrewd invention by thy noble Sire,"
1393,ARGUMENT,"If thou indeed art his, as sure thou art,"
1394,ARGUMENT,"Whose sight breeds wonder in me, and thy speech"
1395,ARGUMENT,His speech resembles more than might be deem'd
1396,ARGUMENT,Within the scope of years so green as thine.
1397,ARGUMENT,"There, never in opinion, or in voice"
1398,ARGUMENT,Illustrious Ulysses and myself
1399,ARGUMENT,"Divided were, but, one in heart, contrived                       160"
1400,ARGUMENT,"As best we might, the benefit of all."
1401,ARGUMENT,"But after Priam's lofty city sack'd,"
1402,ARGUMENT,And the departure of the Greeks on board
1403,ARGUMENT,"Their barks, and when the Gods had scatter'd them,"
1404,ARGUMENT,Then Jove imagin'd for the Argive host
1405,ARGUMENT,A sorrowful return; for neither just
1406,ARGUMENT,"Were all, nor prudent, therefore many found"
1407,ARGUMENT,A fate disast'rous through the vengeful ire
1408,ARGUMENT,"Of Jove-born Pallas, who between the sons"
1409,ARGUMENT,Of Atreus sharp contention interposed.                           170
1410,ARGUMENT,"They both, irregularly, and against"
1411,ARGUMENT,"Just order, summoning by night the Greeks"
1412,ARGUMENT,"To council, of whom many came with wine"
1413,ARGUMENT,"Oppress'd, promulgated the cause for which"
1414,ARGUMENT,They had convened the people. Then it was
1415,ARGUMENT,That Menelaus bade the general host
1416,ARGUMENT,"Their thoughts bend homeward o'er the sacred Deep,"
1417,ARGUMENT,Which Agamemnon in no sort approved.
1418,ARGUMENT,"His counsel was to slay them yet at Troy,"
1419,ARGUMENT,That so he might assuage the dreadful wrath                      180
1420,ARGUMENT,"Of Pallas, first, by sacrifice and pray'r."
1421,ARGUMENT,Vain hope! he little thought how ill should speed
1422,ARGUMENT,"That fond attempt, for, once provok'd, the Gods"
1423,ARGUMENT,Are not with ease conciliated again.
1424,ARGUMENT,"Thus stood the brothers, altercation hot"
1425,ARGUMENT,"Maintaining, till at length, uprose the Greeks"
1426,ARGUMENT,"With deaf'ning clamours, and with diff'ring minds."
1427,ARGUMENT,"We slept the night, but teeming with disgust"
1428,ARGUMENT,"Mutual, for Jove great woe prepar'd for all."
1429,ARGUMENT,At dawn of day we drew our gallies down                          190
1430,ARGUMENT,"Into the sea, and, hasty, put on board"
1431,ARGUMENT,"The spoils and female captives. Half the host,"
1432,ARGUMENT,"With Agamemnon, son of Atreus, stay'd"
1433,ARGUMENT,"Supreme commander, and, embarking, half"
1434,ARGUMENT,"Push'd forth. Swift course we made, for Neptune smooth'd"
1435,ARGUMENT,The waves before us of the monstrous Deep.
1436,ARGUMENT,"At Tenedos arriv'd, we there perform'd"
1437,ARGUMENT,"Sacrifice to the Gods, ardent to reach"
1438,ARGUMENT,"Our native land, but unpropitious Jove,"
1439,ARGUMENT,"Not yet designing our arrival there,                             200"
1440,ARGUMENT,Involved us in dissension fierce again.
1441,ARGUMENT,"For all the crews, followers of the King,"
1442,ARGUMENT,"Thy noble Sire, to gratify our Chief,"
1443,ARGUMENT,"The son of Atreus, chose a diff'rent course,"
1444,ARGUMENT,And steer'd their oary barks again to Troy.
1445,ARGUMENT,"But I, assured that evil from the Gods"
1446,ARGUMENT,"Impended, gath'ring all my gallant fleet,"
1447,ARGUMENT,"Fled thence in haste, and warlike Diomede"
1448,ARGUMENT,"Exhorting his attendants, also fled."
1449,ARGUMENT,"At length, the Hero Menelaus join'd                              210"
1450,ARGUMENT,Our fleets at Lesbos; there he found us held
1451,ARGUMENT,In deep deliberation on the length
1452,ARGUMENT,"Of way before us, whether we should steer"
1453,ARGUMENT,Above the craggy Chios to the isle
1454,ARGUMENT,"Psyria, that island holding on our left,"
1455,ARGUMENT,Or under Chios by the wind-swept heights
1456,ARGUMENT,"Of Mimas. Then we ask'd from Jove a sign,"
1457,ARGUMENT,And by a sign vouchsafed he bade us cut
1458,ARGUMENT,"The wide sea to Eubœa sheer athwart,"
1459,ARGUMENT,So soonest to escape the threat'ned harm.                        220
1460,ARGUMENT,"Shrill sang the rising gale, and with swift prows"
1461,ARGUMENT,"Cleaving the fishy flood, we reach'd by night"
1462,ARGUMENT,"Geræstus, where arrived, we burn'd the thighs"
1463,ARGUMENT,"Of num'rous bulls to Neptune, who had safe"
1464,ARGUMENT,Conducted us through all our perilous course.
1465,ARGUMENT,The fleet of Diomede in safety moor'd
1466,ARGUMENT,"On the fourth day at Argos, but myself"
1467,ARGUMENT,"Held on my course to Pylus, nor the wind"
1468,ARGUMENT,"One moment thwarted us, or died away,"
1469,ARGUMENT,When Jove had once commanded it to blow.                         230
1470,ARGUMENT,"Thus, uninform'd, I have arrived, my son!"
1471,ARGUMENT,"Nor of the Greecians, who are saved have heard,"
1472,ARGUMENT,Or who have perish'd; but what news soe'er
1473,ARGUMENT,"I have obtain'd, since my return, with truth"
1474,ARGUMENT,"I will relate, nor aught conceal from thee."
1475,ARGUMENT,"The spear-famed Myrmidons, as rumour speaks,"
1476,ARGUMENT,"By Neoptolemus, illustrious son"
1477,ARGUMENT,"Of brave Achilles led, have safe arrived;"
1478,ARGUMENT,"Safe, Philoctetes, also son renown'd"
1479,ARGUMENT,Of Pæas; and Idomeneus at Crete                                  240
1480,ARGUMENT,Hath landed all his followers who survive
1481,ARGUMENT,"The bloody war, the waves have swallow'd none."
1482,ARGUMENT,"Ye have yourselves doubtless, although remote,"
1483,ARGUMENT,"Of Agamemnon heard, how he return'd,"
1484,ARGUMENT,And how Ægisthus cruelly contrived
1485,ARGUMENT,"For him a bloody welcome, but himself"
1486,ARGUMENT,Hath with his own life paid the murth'rous deed.
1487,ARGUMENT,"Good is it, therefore, if a son survive"
1488,ARGUMENT,"The slain, since Agamemnon's son hath well"
1489,ARGUMENT,"Avenged his father's death, slaying, himself,                    250"
1490,ARGUMENT,"Ægisthus, foul assassin of his Sire."
1491,ARGUMENT,"Young friend! (for pleas'd thy vig'rous youth I view,"
1492,ARGUMENT,"And just proportion) be thou also bold,"
1493,ARGUMENT,That thine like his may be a deathless name.
1494,ARGUMENT,"Then, prudent, him answer'd Telemachus."
1495,ARGUMENT,"Oh Nestor, Neleus' son, glory of Greece!"
1496,ARGUMENT,And righteous was that vengeance; _his_ renown
1497,ARGUMENT,"Achaia's sons shall far and wide diffuse,"
1498,ARGUMENT,To future times transmitting it in song.
1499,ARGUMENT,Ah! would that such ability the Gods                             260
1500,ARGUMENT,"Would grant to me, that I, as well, the deeds"
1501,ARGUMENT,"Might punish of our suitors, whose excess"
1502,ARGUMENT,"Enormous, and whose bitter taunts I feel"
1503,ARGUMENT,"Continual, object of their subtle hate."
1504,ARGUMENT,But not for me such happiness the Gods
1505,ARGUMENT,"Have twined into my thread; no, not for me"
1506,ARGUMENT,Or for my father. Patience is our part.
1507,ARGUMENT,To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied.
1508,ARGUMENT,Young friend! (since thou remind'st me of that theme)
1509,ARGUMENT,Fame here reports that num'rous suitors haunt                    270
1510,ARGUMENT,"Thy palace for thy mother's sake, and there"
1511,ARGUMENT,Much evil perpetrate in thy despight.
1512,ARGUMENT,"But say, endur'st thou willing their controul"
1513,ARGUMENT,"Imperious, or because the people, sway'd"
1514,ARGUMENT,"By some response oracular, incline"
1515,ARGUMENT,Against thee? But who knows? the time may come
1516,ARGUMENT,"When to his home restored, either alone,"
1517,ARGUMENT,"Or aided by the force of all the Greeks,"
1518,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses may avenge the wrong; at least,"
1519,ARGUMENT,"Should Pallas azure-eyed thee love, as erst                      280"
1520,ARGUMENT,"At Troy, the scene of our unnumber'd woes,"
1521,ARGUMENT,She lov'd Ulysses (for I have not known
1522,ARGUMENT,The Gods assisting so apparently
1523,ARGUMENT,"A mortal man, as him Minerva there)"
1524,ARGUMENT,Should Pallas view thee also with like love
1525,ARGUMENT,"And kind solicitude, some few of those"
1526,ARGUMENT,"Should dream, perchance, of wedlock never more."
1527,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus Telemachus return'd.
1528,ARGUMENT,That word's accomplishment I cannot hope;
1529,ARGUMENT,It promises too much; the thought alone                          290
1530,ARGUMENT,O'erwhelms me; an event so fortunate
1531,ARGUMENT,"Would, unexpected on my part, arrive,"
1532,ARGUMENT,Although the Gods themselves should purpose it.
1533,ARGUMENT,But Pallas him answer'd cærulean-eyed.
1534,ARGUMENT,Telemachus! what word was that which leap'd
1535,ARGUMENT,The iv'ry guard[7] that should have fenced it in?
1536,ARGUMENT,"A God, so willing, could with utmost ease"
1537,ARGUMENT,"Save any man, howe'er remote. Myself,"
1538,ARGUMENT,"I had much rather, many woes endured,"
1539,ARGUMENT,"Revisit home, at last, happy and safe,                           300"
1540,ARGUMENT,"Than, sooner coming, die in my own house,"
1541,ARGUMENT,As Agamemnon perish'd by the arts
1542,ARGUMENT,Of base Ægisthus and the subtle Queen.
1543,ARGUMENT,Yet not the Gods themselves can save from death
1544,ARGUMENT,"All-levelling, the man whom most they love,"
1545,ARGUMENT,When Fate ordains him once to his last sleep.
1546,ARGUMENT,"To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied."
1547,ARGUMENT,"Howe'er it interest us, let us leave"
1548,ARGUMENT,"This question, Mentor! He, I am assured,"
1549,ARGUMENT,"Returns no more, but hath already found                          310"
1550,ARGUMENT,"A sad, sad fate by the decree of heav'n."
1551,ARGUMENT,But I would now interrogate again
1552,ARGUMENT,"Nestor, and on a different theme, for him"
1553,ARGUMENT,"In human rights I judge, and laws expert,"
1554,ARGUMENT,And in all knowledge beyond other men;
1555,ARGUMENT,"For he hath govern'd, as report proclaims,"
1556,ARGUMENT,Three generations; therefore in my eyes
1557,ARGUMENT,He wears the awful impress of a God.
1558,ARGUMENT,"Oh Nestor, son of Neleus, tell me true;"
1559,ARGUMENT,"What was the manner of Atrides' death,                           320"
1560,ARGUMENT,Wide-ruling Agamemnon? Tell me where
1561,ARGUMENT,Was Menelaus? By what means contrived
1562,ARGUMENT,"Ægisthus to inflict the fatal blow,"
1563,ARGUMENT,Slaying so much a nobler than himself?
1564,ARGUMENT,Had not the brother of the Monarch reach'd
1565,ARGUMENT,"Achaian Argos yet, but, wand'ring still"
1566,ARGUMENT,"In other climes, his long absence gave"
1567,ARGUMENT,Ægisthus courage for that bloody deed?
1568,ARGUMENT,Whom answer'd the Gerenian Chief renown'd.
1569,ARGUMENT,My son! I will inform thee true; meantime                        330
1570,ARGUMENT,Thy own suspicions border on the fact.
1571,ARGUMENT,"Had Menelaus, Hero, amber hair'd,"
1572,ARGUMENT,Ægisthus found living at his return
1573,ARGUMENT,"From Ilium, never on _his_ bones the Greeks"
1574,ARGUMENT,"Had heap'd a tomb, but dogs and rav'ning fowls"
1575,ARGUMENT,Had torn him lying in the open field
1576,ARGUMENT,"Far from the town, nor him had woman wept"
1577,ARGUMENT,"Of all in Greece, for he had foul transgress'd."
1578,ARGUMENT,"But we, in many an arduous task engaged,"
1579,ARGUMENT,"Lay before Ilium; he, the while, secure                          340"
1580,ARGUMENT,"Within the green retreats of Argos, found"
1581,ARGUMENT,Occasion apt by flatt'ry to delude
1582,ARGUMENT,"The spouse of Agamemnon; she, at first,"
1583,ARGUMENT,(The royal Clytemnestra) firm refused
1584,ARGUMENT,The deed dishonourable (for she bore
1585,ARGUMENT,"A virtuous mind, and at her side a bard"
1586,ARGUMENT,"Attended ever, whom the King, to Troy"
1587,ARGUMENT,"Departing, had appointed to the charge.)"
1588,ARGUMENT,But when the Gods had purposed to ensnare
1589,ARGUMENT,"Ægisthus, then dismissing far remote                             350"
1590,ARGUMENT,"The bard into a desart isle, he there"
1591,ARGUMENT,"Abandon'd him to rav'ning fowls a prey,"
1592,ARGUMENT,"And to his own home, willing as himself,"
1593,ARGUMENT,Led Clytemnestra. Num'rous thighs he burn'd
1594,ARGUMENT,"On all their hallow'd altars to the Gods,"
1595,ARGUMENT,"And hung with tap'stry, images, and gold"
1596,ARGUMENT,"Their shrines, his great exploit past hope atchiev'd."
1597,ARGUMENT,We (Menelaus and myself) had sailed
1598,ARGUMENT,"From Troy together, but when we approach'd"
1599,ARGUMENT,"Sunium, headland of th' Athenian shore,                          360"
1600,ARGUMENT,"There Phœbus, sudden, with his gentle shafts"
1601,ARGUMENT,Slew Menelaus' pilot while he steer'd
1602,ARGUMENT,"The volant bark, Phrontis, Onetor's son,"
1603,ARGUMENT,"A mariner past all expert, whom none"
1604,ARGUMENT,"In steerage match'd, what time the tempest roar'd."
1605,ARGUMENT,"Here, therefore, Menelaus was detained,"
1606,ARGUMENT,"Giving his friend due burial, and his rites"
1607,ARGUMENT,"Funereal celebrating, though in haste"
1608,ARGUMENT,"Still to proceed. But when, with all his fleet"
1609,ARGUMENT,"The wide sea traversing, he reach'd at length                    370"
1610,ARGUMENT,"Malea's lofty foreland in his course,"
1611,ARGUMENT,"Rough passage, then, and perilous he found."
1612,ARGUMENT,"Shrill blasts the Thund'rer pour'd into his sails,"
1613,ARGUMENT,And wild waves sent him mountainous. His ships
1614,ARGUMENT,"There scatter'd, some to the Cydonian coast"
1615,ARGUMENT,"Of Crete he push'd, near where the Jardan flows."
1616,ARGUMENT,"Beside the confines of Gortyna stands,"
1617,ARGUMENT,"Amid the gloomy flood, a smooth rock, steep"
1618,ARGUMENT,"Toward the sea, against whose leftward point"
1619,ARGUMENT,"Phæstus by name, the South wind rolls the surge                  380"
1620,ARGUMENT,"Amain, which yet the rock, though small, repells."
1621,ARGUMENT,"Hither with part he came, and scarce the crews"
1622,ARGUMENT,"Themselves escaped, while the huge billows broke"
1623,ARGUMENT,"Their ships against the rocks; yet five he saved,"
1624,ARGUMENT,Which winds and waves drove to the Ægyptian shore.
1625,ARGUMENT,"Thus he, provision gath'ring as he went"
1626,ARGUMENT,"And gold abundant, roam'd to distant lands"
1627,ARGUMENT,"And nations of another tongue. Meantime,"
1628,ARGUMENT,Ægisthus these enormities at home
1629,ARGUMENT,"Devising, slew Atrides, and supreme                              390"
1630,ARGUMENT,Rul'd the subjected land; sev'n years he reign'd
1631,ARGUMENT,"In opulent Mycenæ, but the eighth"
1632,ARGUMENT,From Athens brought renown'd Orestes home
1633,ARGUMENT,"For his destruction, who of life bereaved"
1634,ARGUMENT,Ægisthus base assassin of his Sire.
1635,ARGUMENT,"Orestes, therefore, the funereal rites"
1636,ARGUMENT,Performing to his shameless mother's shade
1637,ARGUMENT,"And to her lustful paramour, a feast"
1638,ARGUMENT,Gave to the Argives; on which self-same day
1639,ARGUMENT,"The warlike Menelaus, with his ships                             400"
1640,ARGUMENT,"All treasure-laden to the brink, arrived."
1641,ARGUMENT,"And thou, young friend! from thy forsaken home"
1642,ARGUMENT,"Rove not long time remote, thy treasures left"
1643,ARGUMENT,"At mercy of those proud, lest they divide"
1644,ARGUMENT,"And waste the whole, rend'ring thy voyage vain."
1645,ARGUMENT,But hence to Menelaus is the course
1646,ARGUMENT,To which I counsel thee; for he hath come
1647,ARGUMENT,"Of late from distant lands, whence to escape"
1648,ARGUMENT,"No man could hope, whom tempests first had driv'n"
1649,ARGUMENT,"Devious into so wide a sea, from which                           410"
1650,ARGUMENT,Themselves the birds of heaven could not arrive
1651,ARGUMENT,"In a whole year, so vast is the expanse."
1652,ARGUMENT,"Go, then, with ship and shipmates, or if more"
1653,ARGUMENT,"The land delight thee, steeds thou shalt not want"
1654,ARGUMENT,"Nor chariot, and my sons shall be thy guides"
1655,ARGUMENT,"To noble Lacedemon, the abode"
1656,ARGUMENT,"Of Menelaus; ask from him the truth,"
1657,ARGUMENT,"Who will not lye, for he is passing wise."
1658,ARGUMENT,"While thus he spake, the sun declined, and night"
1659,ARGUMENT,"Approaching, blue-eyed Pallas interposed.                        420"
1660,ARGUMENT,O antient King! well hast thou spoken all.
1661,ARGUMENT,"But now delay not. Cut ye forth the tongues,[8]"
1662,ARGUMENT,"And mingle wine, that (Neptune first invoked"
1663,ARGUMENT,"With due libation, and the other Gods)"
1664,ARGUMENT,We may repair to rest; for even now
1665,ARGUMENT,"The sun is sunk, and it becomes us not"
1666,ARGUMENT,Long to protract a banquet to the Gods
1667,ARGUMENT,"Devote, but in fit season to depart."
1668,ARGUMENT,So spake Jove's daughter; they obedient heard.
1669,ARGUMENT,"The heralds, then, pour'd water on their hands,                  430"
1670,ARGUMENT,"And the attendant youths, filling the cups,"
1671,ARGUMENT,Served them from left to right. Next all the tongues
1672,ARGUMENT,"They cast into the fire, and ev'ry guest"
1673,ARGUMENT,"Arising, pour'd libation to the Gods."
1674,ARGUMENT,"Libation made, and all with wine sufficed,"
1675,ARGUMENT,Godlike Telemachus and Pallas both
1676,ARGUMENT,"Would have return'd, incontinent, on board,"
1677,ARGUMENT,But Nestor urged them still to be his guests.
1678,ARGUMENT,"Forbid it, Jove, and all the Pow'rs of heav'n!"
1679,ARGUMENT,That ye should leave me to repair on board                       440
1680,ARGUMENT,"Your vessel, as I were some needy wretch"
1681,ARGUMENT,Cloakless and destitute of fleecy stores
1682,ARGUMENT,"Wherewith to spread the couch soft for myself,"
1683,ARGUMENT,Or for my guests. No. I have garments warm
1684,ARGUMENT,"An ample store, and rugs of richest dye;"
1685,ARGUMENT,"And never shall Ulysses' son belov'd,"
1686,ARGUMENT,"My frend's own son, sleep on a galley's plank"
1687,ARGUMENT,"While I draw vital air; grant also, heav'n,"
1688,ARGUMENT,"That, dying, I may leave behind me sons"
1689,ARGUMENT,Glad to accommodate whatever guest!                              450
1690,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then Pallas cærulean-eyed.
1691,ARGUMENT,"Old Chief! thou hast well said, and reason bids"
1692,ARGUMENT,Telemachus thy kind commands obey.
1693,ARGUMENT,"Let _him_ attend thee hence, that he may sleep"
1694,ARGUMENT,"Beneath thy roof, but I return on board"
1695,ARGUMENT,"Myself, to instruct my people, and to give"
1696,ARGUMENT,All needful orders; for among them none
1697,ARGUMENT,"Is old as I, but they are youths alike,"
1698,ARGUMENT,"Coevals of Telemachus, with whom"
1699,ARGUMENT,They have embark'd for friendship's sake alone.                  460
1700,ARGUMENT,I therefore will repose myself on board
1701,ARGUMENT,"This night, and to the Caucons bold in arms"
1702,ARGUMENT,"Will sail to-morrow, to demand arrears"
1703,ARGUMENT,"Long time unpaid, and of no small amount."
1704,ARGUMENT,"But, since he is become thy guest, afford"
1705,ARGUMENT,"My friend a chariot, and a son of thine"
1706,ARGUMENT,"Who shall direct his way, nor let him want"
1707,ARGUMENT,Of all thy steeds the swiftest and the best.
1708,ARGUMENT,"So saying, the blue-eyed Goddess as upborne"
1709,ARGUMENT,"On eagle's wings, vanish'd; amazement seized                     470"
1710,ARGUMENT,"The whole assembly, and the antient King"
1711,ARGUMENT,"O'erwhelmed with wonder at that sight, the hand"
1712,ARGUMENT,"Grasp'd of Telemachus, whom he thus bespake."
1713,ARGUMENT,My friend! I prophesy that thou shalt prove
1714,ARGUMENT,"Nor base nor dastard, whom, so young, the Gods"
1715,ARGUMENT,Already take in charge; for of the Pow'rs
1716,ARGUMENT,"Inhabitants of heav'n, none else was this"
1717,ARGUMENT,"Than Jove's own daughter Pallas, who among"
1718,ARGUMENT,The Greecians honour'd most thy gen'rous Sire.
1719,ARGUMENT,"But thou, O Queen! compassionate us all,                       480"
1720,ARGUMENT,"Myself, my sons, my comfort; give to each"
1721,ARGUMENT,"A glorious name, and I to thee will give"
1722,ARGUMENT,"For sacrifice an heifer of the year,"
1723,ARGUMENT,"Broad-fronted, one that never yet hath borne"
1724,ARGUMENT,"The yoke, and will incase her horns with gold."
1725,ARGUMENT,"So Nestor pray'd, whom Pallas gracious heard."
1726,ARGUMENT,"Then the Gerenian warrior old, before"
1727,ARGUMENT,"His sons and sons in law, to his abode"
1728,ARGUMENT,Magnificent proceeded: they (arrived
1729,ARGUMENT,Within the splendid palace of the King)                          490
1730,ARGUMENT,"On thrones and couches sat in order ranged,"
1731,ARGUMENT,"Whom Nestor welcom'd, charging high the cup"
1732,ARGUMENT,"With wine of richest sort, which she who kept"
1733,ARGUMENT,"That treasure, now in the eleventh year"
1734,ARGUMENT,"First broach'd, unsealing the delicious juice."
1735,ARGUMENT,"With this the hoary Senior fill'd a cup,"
1736,ARGUMENT,And to the daughter of Jove Ægis-arm'd
1737,ARGUMENT,"Pouring libation, offer'd fervent pray'r."
1738,ARGUMENT,"When all had made libation, and no wish"
1739,ARGUMENT,"Remain'd of more, then each to rest retired,                     500"
1740,ARGUMENT,And Nestor the Gerenian warrior old
1741,ARGUMENT,Led thence Telemachus to a carved couch
1742,ARGUMENT,Beneath the sounding portico prepared.
1743,ARGUMENT,"Beside him he bade sleep the spearman bold,"
1744,ARGUMENT,"Pisistratus, a gallant youth, the sole"
1745,ARGUMENT,Unwedded in his house of all his sons.
1746,ARGUMENT,"Himself in the interior palace lay,"
1747,ARGUMENT,Where couch and cov'ring for her antient spouse
1748,ARGUMENT,The consort Queen had diligent prepar'd.
1749,ARGUMENT,"But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,                         510"
1750,ARGUMENT,"Had tinged the East, arising from his bed,"
1751,ARGUMENT,"Gerenian Nestor issued forth, and sat"
1752,ARGUMENT,Before his palace-gate on the white stones
1753,ARGUMENT,"Resplendent as with oil, on which of old"
1754,ARGUMENT,"His father Neleus had been wont to sit,"
1755,ARGUMENT,"In council like a God; but he had sought,"
1756,ARGUMENT,"By destiny dismiss'd long since, the shades."
1757,ARGUMENT,"On those stones therefore now, Nestor himself,"
1758,ARGUMENT,"Achaia's guardian, sat, sceptre in hand,"
1759,ARGUMENT,"Where soon his num'rous sons, leaving betimes                    520"
1760,ARGUMENT,"The place of their repose, also appeared,"
1761,ARGUMENT,"Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Thrasymedes,"
1762,ARGUMENT,Aretus and Pisistratus. They placed
1763,ARGUMENT,"Godlike Telemachus at Nestor's side,"
1764,ARGUMENT,And the Gerenian Hero thus began.
1765,ARGUMENT,Sons be ye quick--execute with dispatch
1766,ARGUMENT,"My purpose, that I may propitiate first"
1767,ARGUMENT,"Of all the Gods Minerva, who herself"
1768,ARGUMENT,Hath honour'd manifest our hallow'd feast.
1769,ARGUMENT,"Haste, one, into the field, to order thence                      530"
1770,ARGUMENT,"An ox, and let the herdsman drive it home."
1771,ARGUMENT,"Another, hasting to the sable bark"
1772,ARGUMENT,"Of brave Telemachus, bring hither all"
1773,ARGUMENT,"His friends, save two, and let a third command"
1774,ARGUMENT,"Laerceus, that he come to enwrap with gold"
1775,ARGUMENT,"The victim's horns. Abide ye here, the rest,"
1776,ARGUMENT,And bid my female train (for I intend
1777,ARGUMENT,A banquet) with all diligence provide
1778,ARGUMENT,"Seats, stores of wood, and water from the rock."
1779,ARGUMENT,"He said, whom instant all obey'd. The ox                       540"
1780,ARGUMENT,"Came from the field, and from the gallant ship"
1781,ARGUMENT,The ship-mates of the brave Telemachus;
1782,ARGUMENT,"Next, charged with all his implements of art,"
1783,ARGUMENT,"His mallet, anvil, pincers, came the smith"
1784,ARGUMENT,To give the horns their gilding; also came
1785,ARGUMENT,Pallas herself to her own sacred rites.
1786,ARGUMENT,"Then Nestor, hoary warrior, furnish'd gold,"
1787,ARGUMENT,"Which, hammer'd thin, the artist wrapp'd around"
1788,ARGUMENT,"The victim's horns, that seeing him attired"
1789,ARGUMENT,"So costly, Pallas might the more be pleased.                     550"
1790,ARGUMENT,Stratius and brave Echephron introduced
1791,ARGUMENT,The victim by his horns; Aretus brought
1792,ARGUMENT,"A laver in one hand, with flow'rs emboss'd,"
1793,ARGUMENT,And in his other hand a basket stored
1794,ARGUMENT,"With cakes, while warlike Thrasymedes, arm'd"
1795,ARGUMENT,"With his long-hafted ax, prepared to smite"
1796,ARGUMENT,"The ox, and Perseus to receive the blood."
1797,ARGUMENT,The hoary Nestor consecrated first
1798,ARGUMENT,"Both cakes and water, and with earnest pray'r"
1799,ARGUMENT,"To Pallas, gave the forelock to the flames.                      560"
1800,ARGUMENT,"When all had worshipp'd, and the broken cakes"
1801,ARGUMENT,"Sprinkled, then godlike Thrasymedes drew"
1802,ARGUMENT,"Close to the ox, and smote him. Deep the edge"
1803,ARGUMENT,"Enter'd, and senseless on the floor he fell."
1804,ARGUMENT,"Then Nestor's daughters, and the consorts all"
1805,ARGUMENT,"Of Nestor's sons, with his own consort, chaste"
1806,ARGUMENT,"Eurydice, the daughter eldest-born"
1807,ARGUMENT,"Of Clymenus, in one shrill orison"
1808,ARGUMENT,"Vocif'rous join'd, while they, lifting the ox,"
1809,ARGUMENT,"Held him supported firmly, and the prince                        570"
1810,ARGUMENT,"Of men, Pisistratus, his gullet pierced."
1811,ARGUMENT,"Soon as the sable blood had ceased, and life"
1812,ARGUMENT,"Had left the victim, spreading him abroad,"
1813,ARGUMENT,With nice address they parted at the joint
1814,ARGUMENT,"His thighs, and wrapp'd them in the double cawl,"
1815,ARGUMENT,Which with crude slices thin they overspread.
1816,ARGUMENT,"Nestor burn'd incense, and libation pour'd"
1817,ARGUMENT,"Large on the hissing brands, while him beside,"
1818,ARGUMENT,"Busy with spit and prong, stood many a youth"
1819,ARGUMENT,"Train'd to the task. The thighs consumed, each took"
1820,ARGUMENT,"His portion of the maw, then, slashing well                      581"
1821,ARGUMENT,"The remnant, they transpierced it with the spits"
1822,ARGUMENT,"Neatly, and held it reeking at the fire."
1823,ARGUMENT,Meantime the youngest of the daughters fair
1824,ARGUMENT,"Of Nestor, beauteous Polycaste, laved,"
1825,ARGUMENT,"Anointed, and in vest and tunic cloathed"
1826,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, who, so refresh'd, stepp'd forth"
1827,ARGUMENT,"From the bright laver graceful as a God,"

1829,ARGUMENT,"The viands dress'd, and from the spits withdrawn,                590"
1830,ARGUMENT,"They sat to share the feast, and princely youths"
1831,ARGUMENT,"Arising, gave them wine in cups of gold."
1832,ARGUMENT,When neither hunger now nor thirst remain'd
1833,ARGUMENT,"Unsated, thus Gerenian Nestor spake."
1834,ARGUMENT,"My sons, arise, lead forth the sprightly steeds,"
1835,ARGUMENT,"And yoke them, that Telemachus may go."
1836,ARGUMENT,"So spake the Chief, to whose commands his sons,"
1837,ARGUMENT,"Obedient, yoked in haste the rapid steeds,"
1838,ARGUMENT,And the intendant matron of the stores
1839,ARGUMENT,"Disposed meantime within the chariot, bread                      600"
1840,ARGUMENT,"And wine, and dainties, such as princes eat."
1841,ARGUMENT,Telemachus into the chariot first
1842,ARGUMENT,"Ascended, and beside him, next, his place"
1843,ARGUMENT,"Pisistratus the son of Nestor took,"
1844,ARGUMENT,"Then seiz'd the reins, and lash'd the coursers on."
1845,ARGUMENT,"They, nothing loth, into the open plain"
1846,ARGUMENT,"Flew, leaving lofty Pylus soon afar."
1847,ARGUMENT,"Thus, journeying, they shook on either side"
1848,ARGUMENT,"The yoke all day, and now the setting sun"
1849,ARGUMENT,"To dusky evening had resign'd the roads,                         610"
1850,ARGUMENT,"When they to Pheræ came, and the abode"
1851,ARGUMENT,"Reach'd of Diocles, whose illustrious Sire"
1852,ARGUMENT,"Orsilochus from Alpheus drew his birth,"
1853,ARGUMENT,"And there, with kindness entertain'd, they slept."
1854,ARGUMENT,"But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,"
1855,ARGUMENT,"Look'd rosy from the East, yoking the steeds,"
1856,ARGUMENT,They in their sumptuous chariot sat again.
1857,ARGUMENT,"The son of Nestor plied the lash, and forth"
1858,ARGUMENT,Through vestibule and sounding portico
1859,ARGUMENT,"The royal coursers, not unwilling, flew.                         620"
1860,ARGUMENT,"A corn-invested land receiv'd them next,"
1861,ARGUMENT,"And there they brought their journey to a close,"
1862,ARGUMENT,So rapidly they moved; and now the sun
1863,ARGUMENT,"Went down, and even-tide dimm'd all the ways."

1907,ARGUMENT,"Achilles' offspring, ruled the Myrmidons."

1926,ARGUMENT,Across the palace to report the news
1927,ARGUMENT,"To his Lord's ear, and, standing at his side,"
1928,ARGUMENT,In accents wing'd with haste thus greeted him.
1929,ARGUMENT,Oh Menelaus! Heav'n descended Chief!
1930,ARGUMENT,"Two guests arrive, both strangers, but the race"
1931,ARGUMENT,Of Jove supreme resembling each in form.
1932,ARGUMENT,"Say, shall we loose, ourselves, their rapid steeds,"
1933,ARGUMENT,Or hence dismiss them to some other host?
1934,ARGUMENT,"But Menelaus, Hero golden-hair'd,"
1935,ARGUMENT,Indignant answer'd him. Boethe's son!                             40
1936,ARGUMENT,"Thou wast not, Eteoneus, heretofore,"
1937,ARGUMENT,"A babbler, who now pratest as a child."

1940,ARGUMENT,"If Jove shall, even here, some pause at last"
1941,ARGUMENT,"Of woe afford us. Therefore loose, at once,"
1942,ARGUMENT,"Their steeds, and introduce them to the feast."
1943,ARGUMENT,"He said, and, issuing, Eteoneus call'd"
1944,ARGUMENT,"The brisk attendants to his aid, with whom"

1946,ARGUMENT,"Them first they bound to mangers, which with oats"

1951,ARGUMENT,Of the heav'n-favour'd King; for on all sides
1952,ARGUMENT,As with the splendour of the sun or moon
1953,ARGUMENT,The lofty dome of Menelaus blazed.
1954,ARGUMENT,"Satiate, at length, with wonder at that sight,"
1955,ARGUMENT,"They enter'd each a bath, and by the hands                        60"
1956,ARGUMENT,"Of maidens laved, and oil'd, and cloath'd again"
1957,ARGUMENT,"With shaggy mantles and resplendent vests,"

1960,ARGUMENT,"And with an argent laver, pouring first"

1973,ARGUMENT,But rather of some race of sceptred Chiefs
1974,ARGUMENT,Heav'n-born; the base have never sons like you.

1976,ARGUMENT,"Distinguish'd portion, and the fatted chine"
1977,ARGUMENT,Gave to his guests; the sav'ry viands they
1978,ARGUMENT,"With outstretch'd hands assail'd, and when the force"
1979,ARGUMENT,"No longer now of appetite they felt,"
1980,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, inclining close his head"
1981,ARGUMENT,"To Nestor's son, lest others should his speech"

1984,ARGUMENT,How all the echoing palace with the light
1985,ARGUMENT,"Of beaming brass, of gold and amber shines                        90"
1986,ARGUMENT,Silver and ivory! for radiance such
1987,ARGUMENT,Th' interior mansion of Olympian Jove
1988,ARGUMENT,"I deem. What wealth, how various, how immense"
1989,ARGUMENT,Is here! astonish'd I survey the sight!
1990,ARGUMENT,"But Menelaus, golden-hair'd, his speech"
1991,ARGUMENT,"O'erhearing, thus in accents wing'd replied"
1992,ARGUMENT,My children! let no mortal man pretend
1993,ARGUMENT,Comparison with Jove; for Jove's abode
1994,ARGUMENT,And all his stores are incorruptible.
1995,ARGUMENT,But whether mortal man with me may vie                           100
1996,ARGUMENT,"In the display of wealth, or whether not,"
1997,ARGUMENT,"This know, that after many toils endured,"
1998,ARGUMENT,"And perilous wand'rings wide, in the eighth year"
1999,ARGUMENT,I brought my treasures home. Remote I roved
2000,ARGUMENT,"To Cyprus, to Phœnice, to the shores"
2001,ARGUMENT,"Of Ægypt; Æthiopia's land I reach'd,"
2002,ARGUMENT,"Th' Erembi, the Sidonians, and the coasts"
2003,ARGUMENT,"Of Lybia, where the lambs their foreheads shew"
2004,ARGUMENT,"At once with horns defended, soon as yean'd."
2005,ARGUMENT,"There, thrice within the year the flocks produce,                110"
2006,ARGUMENT,"Nor master, there, nor shepherd ever feels"
2007,ARGUMENT,"A dearth of cheese, of flesh, or of sweet milk"
2008,ARGUMENT,"Delicious, drawn from udders never dry."
2009,ARGUMENT,"While, thus, commodities on various coasts"
2010,ARGUMENT,"Gath'ring I roam'd, another, by the arts"
2011,ARGUMENT,"Of his pernicious spouse aided, of life"
2012,ARGUMENT,"Bereav'd my brother privily, and when least"
2013,ARGUMENT,He fear'd to lose it. Therefore little joy
2014,ARGUMENT,To me results from all that I possess.
2015,ARGUMENT,Your fathers (be those fathers who they may)                     120
2016,ARGUMENT,These things have doubtless told you; for immense
2017,ARGUMENT,"Have been my suff'rings, and I have destroy'd"
2018,ARGUMENT,A palace well inhabited and stored
2019,ARGUMENT,With precious furniture in ev'ry kind;
2020,ARGUMENT,"Such, that I would to heav'n! I own'd at home"
2021,ARGUMENT,"Though but the third of it, and that the Greeks"
2022,ARGUMENT,"Who perish'd then, beneath the walls of Troy"
2023,ARGUMENT,"Far from steed-pastured Argos, still survived."
2024,ARGUMENT,"Yet while, sequester'd here, I frequent mourn"
2025,ARGUMENT,"My slaughter'd friends, by turns I sooth my soul                 130"
2026,ARGUMENT,"With tears shed for them, and by turns again"
2027,ARGUMENT,I cease; for grief soon satiates free indulged.
2028,ARGUMENT,"But of them all, although I all bewail,"
2029,ARGUMENT,"None mourn I so as one, whom calling back"
2030,ARGUMENT,"To memory, I both sleep and food abhor."
2031,ARGUMENT,"For, of Achaia's sons none ever toiled"
2032,ARGUMENT,Strenuous as Ulysses; but his lot
2033,ARGUMENT,"Was woe, and unremitting sorrow mine"
2034,ARGUMENT,"For his long absence, who, if still he live,"
2035,ARGUMENT,"We know not aught, or be already dead.                           140"
2036,ARGUMENT,"Him doubtless, old Laertes mourns, and him"
2037,ARGUMENT,"Discrete Penelope, nor less his son"
2038,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, born newly when he sail'd."
2039,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he kindled in him strong desire"
2040,ARGUMENT,To mourn his father; at his father's name
2041,ARGUMENT,"Fast fell his tears to ground, and with both hands"
2042,ARGUMENT,He spread his purple cloak before his eyes;
2043,ARGUMENT,"Which Menelaus marking, doubtful sat"
2044,ARGUMENT,"If he should leave him leisure for his tears,"
2045,ARGUMENT,"Or question him, and tell him all at large.                      150"
2046,ARGUMENT,"While thus he doubted, Helen (as it chanced)"
2047,ARGUMENT,"Leaving her fragrant chamber, came, august"
2048,ARGUMENT,"As Dian, goddess of the golden bow."
2049,ARGUMENT,"Adrasta, for her use, set forth a throne,"
2050,ARGUMENT,"Alcippe with soft arras cover'd it,"
2051,ARGUMENT,"And Philo brought her silver basket, gift"
2052,ARGUMENT,"Of fair Alcandra, wife of Polybus,"
2053,ARGUMENT,Whose mansion in Ægyptian Thebes is rich
2054,ARGUMENT,"In untold treasure, and who gave, himself,"
2055,ARGUMENT,"Ten golden talents, and two silver baths                         160"
2056,ARGUMENT,"To Menelaus, with two splendid tripods"
2057,ARGUMENT,"Beside the noble gifts which, at the hand"
2058,ARGUMENT,"Of his illustrious spouse, Helen receiv'd;"
2059,ARGUMENT,"A golden spindle, and a basket wheel'd,"
2060,ARGUMENT,"Itself of silver, and its lip of gold."
2061,ARGUMENT,"That basket Philo, her own handmaid, placed"
2062,ARGUMENT,"At beauteous Helen's side, charged to the brim"
2063,ARGUMENT,"With slender threads, on which the spindle lay"
2064,ARGUMENT,With wool of purple lustre wrapp'd around.
2065,ARGUMENT,"Approaching, on her foot-stool'd throne she sat,                 170"
2066,ARGUMENT,"And, instant, of her royal spouse enquired."
2067,ARGUMENT,"Know we, my Menelaus, dear to Jove!"
2068,ARGUMENT,"These guests of ours, and whence they have arrived?"
2069,ARGUMENT,"Erroneous I may speak, yet speak I must;"
2070,ARGUMENT,In man or woman never have I seen
2071,ARGUMENT,Such likeness to another (wonder-fixt
2072,ARGUMENT,I gaze) as in this stranger to the son
2073,ARGUMENT,"Of brave Ulysses, whom that Hero left"
2074,ARGUMENT,"New-born at home, when (shameless as I was)"
2075,ARGUMENT,For my unworthy sake the Greecians sailed                        180
2076,ARGUMENT,"To Ilium, with fierce rage of battle fir'd."
2077,ARGUMENT,"Then Menelaus, thus, the golden-hair'd."
2078,ARGUMENT,I also such resemblance find in him
2079,ARGUMENT,"As thou; such feet, such hands, the cast of eye[10]"
2080,ARGUMENT,"Similar, and the head and flowing locks."
2081,ARGUMENT,"And even now, when I Ulysses named,"
2082,ARGUMENT,"And his great sufferings mention'd, in my cause,"
2083,ARGUMENT,"The bitter tear dropp'd from his lids, while broad"
2084,ARGUMENT,Before his eyes his purple cloak he spread.
2085,ARGUMENT,To whom the son of Nestor thus replied.                        190
2086,ARGUMENT,Atrides! Menelaus! Chief renown'd!
2087,ARGUMENT,"He is in truth his son, as thou hast said,"
2088,ARGUMENT,"But he is modest, and would much himself"
2089,ARGUMENT,"Condemn, if, at his first arrival here,"
2090,ARGUMENT,"He should loquacious seem and bold to thee,"
2091,ARGUMENT,"To whom we listen, captived by thy voice,"
2092,ARGUMENT,"As if some God had spoken. As for me,"
2093,ARGUMENT,"Nestor, my father, the Gerenian Chief"
2094,ARGUMENT,"Bade me conduct him hither, for he wish'd"
2095,ARGUMENT,"To see thee, promising himself from thee                         200"
2096,ARGUMENT,The benefit of some kind word or deed.
2097,ARGUMENT,"For, destitute of other aid, he much"
2098,ARGUMENT,His father's tedious absence mourns at home.
2099,ARGUMENT,So fares Telemachus; his father strays
2100,ARGUMENT,"Remote, and, in his stead, no friend hath he"
2101,ARGUMENT,Who might avert the mischiefs that he feels.
2102,ARGUMENT,To whom the Hero amber-hair'd replied.
2103,ARGUMENT,Ye Gods! the offspring of indeed a friend
2104,ARGUMENT,"Hath reach'd my house, of one who hath endured"
2105,ARGUMENT,Arduous conflicts num'rous for my sake;                          210
2106,ARGUMENT,"And much I purpos'd, had Olympian Jove"
2107,ARGUMENT,"Vouchsaf'd us prosp'rous passage o'er the Deep,"
2108,ARGUMENT,To have receiv'd him with such friendship here
2109,ARGUMENT,As none beside. In Argos I had then
2110,ARGUMENT,"Founded a city for him, and had rais'd"
2111,ARGUMENT,A palace for himself; I would have brought
2112,ARGUMENT,"The Hero hither, and his son, with all"
2113,ARGUMENT,"His people, and with all his wealth, some town"
2114,ARGUMENT,"Evacuating for his sake, of those"
2115,ARGUMENT,"Ruled by myself, and neighb'ring close my own.                   220"
2116,ARGUMENT,"Thus situate, we had often interchanged"
2117,ARGUMENT,"Sweet converse, nor had other cause at last"
2118,ARGUMENT,"Our friendship terminated or our joys,"
2119,ARGUMENT,Than death's black cloud o'ershadowing him or me.
2120,ARGUMENT,But such delights could only envy move
2121,ARGUMENT,"Ev'n in the Gods, who have, of all the Greeks,"
2122,ARGUMENT,Amerc'd _him_ only of his wish'd return.
2123,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he kindled the desire to weep"
2124,ARGUMENT,In ev'ry bosom. Argive Helen wept
2125,ARGUMENT,"Abundant, Jove's own daughter; wept as fast                      230"
2126,ARGUMENT,Telemachus and Menelaus both;
2127,ARGUMENT,"Nor Nestor's son with tearless eyes remain'd,"
2128,ARGUMENT,Calling to mind Antilochus[11] by the son[12]
2129,ARGUMENT,"Illustrious of the bright Aurora slain,"
2130,ARGUMENT,"Rememb'ring whom, in accents wing'd he said."
2131,ARGUMENT,"Atrides! antient Nestor, when of late"
2132,ARGUMENT,"Conversing with him, we remember'd thee,"
2133,ARGUMENT,Pronounced thee wise beyond all human-kind.
2134,ARGUMENT,"Now therefore, let not even my advice"
2135,ARGUMENT,Displease thee. It affords me no delight                         240
2136,ARGUMENT,"To intermingle tears with my repast,"
2137,ARGUMENT,"And soon, Aurora, daughter of the dawn,"
2138,ARGUMENT,Will tinge the orient. Not that I account
2139,ARGUMENT,Due lamentation of a friend deceased
2140,ARGUMENT,"Blameworthy, since, to sheer the locks and weep,"
2141,ARGUMENT,Is all we can for the unhappy dead.
2142,ARGUMENT,"I also have my grief, call'd to lament"
2143,ARGUMENT,"One, not the meanest of Achaia's sons,"
2144,ARGUMENT,My brother; him I cannot but suppose
2145,ARGUMENT,"To thee well-known, although unknown to me                       250"
2146,ARGUMENT,Who saw him never;[13] but report proclaims
2147,ARGUMENT,"Antilochus superior to the most,"
2148,ARGUMENT,"In speed superior, and in feats of arms."
2149,ARGUMENT,"To whom, the Hero of the yellow locks."
2150,ARGUMENT,O friend belov'd! since nought which thou hast said
2151,ARGUMENT,"Or recommended now, would have disgraced"
2152,ARGUMENT,"A man of years maturer far than thine,"
2153,ARGUMENT,"(For wise thy father is, and such art thou,"
2154,ARGUMENT,And easy is it to discern the son
2155,ARGUMENT,"Of such a father, whom Saturnian Jove                            260"
2156,ARGUMENT,In marriage both and at his birth ordain'd
2157,ARGUMENT,To great felicity; for he hath giv'n
2158,ARGUMENT,To Nestor gradually to sink at home
2159,ARGUMENT,"Into old age, and, while he lives, to see"
2160,ARGUMENT,"His sons past others wise, and skill'd in arms)"
2161,ARGUMENT,The sorrow into which we sudden fell
2162,ARGUMENT,Shall pause. Come--now remember we the feast;
2163,ARGUMENT,"Pour water on our hands, for we shall find,"
2164,ARGUMENT,(Telemachus and I) no dearth of themes
2165,ARGUMENT,For mutual converse when the day shall dawn.                     270
2166,ARGUMENT,"He ended; then, Asphalion, at his word,"
2167,ARGUMENT,"Servant of glorious Menelaus, poured"
2168,ARGUMENT,"Pure water on their hands, and they the feast"
2169,ARGUMENT,Before them with keen appetite assail'd.
2170,ARGUMENT,"But Jove-born Helen otherwise, meantime,"
2171,ARGUMENT,"Employ'd, into the wine of which they drank"
2172,ARGUMENT,"A drug infused, antidote to the pains"
2173,ARGUMENT,"Of grief and anger, a most potent charm"
2174,ARGUMENT,For ills of ev'ry name. Whoe'er his wine
2175,ARGUMENT,"So medicated drinks, he shall not pour                           280"
2176,ARGUMENT,"All day the tears down his wan cheek, although"
2177,ARGUMENT,"His father and his mother both were dead,"
2178,ARGUMENT,Nor even though his brother or his son
2179,ARGUMENT,"Had fall'n in battle, and before his eyes."
2180,ARGUMENT,"Such drugs Jove's daughter own'd, with skill prepar'd,"
2181,ARGUMENT,"And of prime virtue, by the wife of Thone,"
2182,ARGUMENT,"Ægyptian Polydamna, giv'n her."
2183,ARGUMENT,"For Ægypt teems with drugs, yielding no few"
2184,ARGUMENT,"Which, mingled with the drink, are good, and many"
2185,ARGUMENT,"Of baneful juice, and enemies to life.                           290"
2186,ARGUMENT,There ev'ry man in skill medicinal
2187,ARGUMENT,"Excels, for they are sons of Pæon all."
2188,ARGUMENT,"That drug infused, she bade her servant pour"
2189,ARGUMENT,"The bev'rage forth, and thus her speech resumed."
2190,ARGUMENT,Atrides! Menelaus! dear to Jove!
2191,ARGUMENT,"These also are the sons of Chiefs renown'd,"
2192,ARGUMENT,"(For Jove, as pleases him, to each assigns"
2193,ARGUMENT,"Or good or evil, whom all things obey)"
2194,ARGUMENT,"Now therefore, feasting at your ease reclin'd,"
2195,ARGUMENT,"Listen with pleasure, for myself, the while,                     300"
2196,ARGUMENT,Will matter seasonable interpose.
2197,ARGUMENT,"I cannot all rehearse, nor even name,"
2198,ARGUMENT,(Omitting none) the conflicts and exploits
2199,ARGUMENT,Of brave Ulysses; but with what address
2200,ARGUMENT,"Successful, one atchievement he perform'd"
2201,ARGUMENT,"At Ilium, where Achaia's sons endured"
2202,ARGUMENT,"Such hardship, will I speak. Inflicting wounds"
2203,ARGUMENT,"Dishonourable on himself, he took"
2204,ARGUMENT,"A tatter'd garb, and like a serving-man"
2205,ARGUMENT,Enter'd the spacious city of your foes.                          310
2206,ARGUMENT,"So veil'd, some mendicant he seem'd, although"
2207,ARGUMENT,No Greecian less deserved that name than he.
2208,ARGUMENT,In such disguise he enter'd; all alike
2209,ARGUMENT,Misdeem'd him; me alone he not deceived
2210,ARGUMENT,"Who challeng'd him, but, shrewd, he turn'd away."
2211,ARGUMENT,"At length, however, when I had myself"
2212,ARGUMENT,"Bathed him, anointed, cloath'd him, and had sworn"
2213,ARGUMENT,Not to declare him openly in Troy
2214,ARGUMENT,"Till he should reach again the camp and fleet,"
2215,ARGUMENT,He told me the whole purpose of the Greeks.                      320
2216,ARGUMENT,"Then, (many a Trojan slaughter'd,) he regain'd"
2217,ARGUMENT,"The camp, and much intelligence he bore"
2218,ARGUMENT,To the Achaians. Oh what wailing then
2219,ARGUMENT,Was heard of Trojan women! but my heart
2220,ARGUMENT,"Exulted, alter'd now, and wishing home;"
2221,ARGUMENT,For now my crime committed under force
2222,ARGUMENT,"Of Venus' influence I deplored, what time"
2223,ARGUMENT,"She led me to a country far remote,"
2224,ARGUMENT,"A wand'rer from the matrimonial bed,"
2225,ARGUMENT,"From my own child, and from my rightful Lord                     330"
2226,ARGUMENT,Alike unblemish'd both in form and mind.
2227,ARGUMENT,Her answer'd then the Hero golden-hair'd.
2228,ARGUMENT,Helen! thou hast well spoken. All is true.
2229,ARGUMENT,I have the talents fathom'd and the minds
2230,ARGUMENT,"Of num'rous Heroes, and have travell'd far"
2231,ARGUMENT,Yet never saw I with these eyes in man
2232,ARGUMENT,Such firmness as the calm Ulysses own'd;
2233,ARGUMENT,"None such as in the wooden horse he proved,"
2234,ARGUMENT,"Where all our bravest sat, designing woe"
2235,ARGUMENT,And bloody havoc for the sons of Troy.                           340
2236,ARGUMENT,"Thou thither cam'st, impell'd, as it should seem,"
2237,ARGUMENT,By some divinity inclin'd to give
2238,ARGUMENT,"Victory to our foes, and with thee came"
2239,ARGUMENT,Godlike Deiphobus. Thrice round about
2240,ARGUMENT,"The hollow ambush, striking with thy hand"
2241,ARGUMENT,"Its sides thou went'st, and by his name didst call"
2242,ARGUMENT,Each prince of Greece feigning his consort's voice.
2243,ARGUMENT,"Myself with Diomede, and with divine"
2244,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, seated in the midst, the call"
2245,ARGUMENT,Heard plain and loud; we (Diomede and I)                         350
2246,ARGUMENT,With ardour burn'd either to quit the horse
2247,ARGUMENT,"So summon'd, or to answer from within."
2248,ARGUMENT,"But, all impatient as we were, Ulysses"
2249,ARGUMENT,Controul'd the rash design; so there the sons
2250,ARGUMENT,"Of the Achaians silent sat and mute,"
2251,ARGUMENT,And of us all Anticlus would alone
2252,ARGUMENT,Have answer'd; but Ulysses with both hands
2253,ARGUMENT,"Compressing close his lips, saved us, nor ceased"
2254,ARGUMENT,Till Pallas thence conducted thee again.
2255,ARGUMENT,"Then thus, discrete, Telemachus replied.                       360"
2256,ARGUMENT,Atrides! Menelaus! prince renown'd!
2257,ARGUMENT,Hard was his lot whom these rare qualities
2258,ARGUMENT,"Preserved not, neither had his dauntless heart"
2259,ARGUMENT,"Been iron, had he scaped his cruel doom."
2260,ARGUMENT,"But haste, dismiss us hence, that on our beds"
2261,ARGUMENT,"Reposed, we may enjoy sleep, needful now."
2262,ARGUMENT,He ceas'd; then Argive Helen gave command
2263,ARGUMENT,To her attendant maidens to prepare
2264,ARGUMENT,Beds in the portico with purple rugs
2265,ARGUMENT,"Resplendent, and with arras, overspread,                         370"
2266,ARGUMENT,And cover'd warm with cloaks of shaggy pile.
2267,ARGUMENT,"Forth went the maidens, bearing each a torch,"
2268,ARGUMENT,"And spread the couches; next, the herald them"
2269,ARGUMENT,"Led forth, and in the vestibule the son"
2270,ARGUMENT,"Of Nestor and the youthful Hero slept,"
2271,ARGUMENT,Telemachus; but in the interior house
2272,ARGUMENT,"Atrides, with the loveliest of her sex"
2273,ARGUMENT,"Beside him, Helen of the sweeping stole."
2274,ARGUMENT,"But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,"
2275,ARGUMENT,"Glow'd in the East, then from his couch arose                    380"
2276,ARGUMENT,"The warlike Menelaus, fresh attir'd;"
2277,ARGUMENT,"His faulchion o'er his shoulders slung, he bound"
2278,ARGUMENT,"His sandals fair to his unsullied feet,"
2279,ARGUMENT,"And like a God issuing, at the side"
2280,ARGUMENT,"Sat of Telemachus, to whom he spake."
2281,ARGUMENT,Hero! Telemachus! what urgent cause
2282,ARGUMENT,"Hath hither led thee, to the land far-famed"
2283,ARGUMENT,Of Lacedæmon o'er the spacious Deep?
2284,ARGUMENT,Public concern or private? Tell me true.
2285,ARGUMENT,To whom Telemachus discrete replied.                           390
2286,ARGUMENT,Atrides! Menelaus! prince renown'd!
2287,ARGUMENT,"News seeking of my Sire, I have arrived."
2288,ARGUMENT,"My household is devour'd, my fruitful fields"
2289,ARGUMENT,"Are desolated, and my palace fill'd"
2290,ARGUMENT,"With enemies, who while they mutual wage"
2291,ARGUMENT,"Proud competition for my mother's love,"
2292,ARGUMENT,"My flocks continual slaughter, and my beeves."
2293,ARGUMENT,"For this cause, at thy knees suppliant, I beg"
2294,ARGUMENT,"That thou wouldst tell me his disastrous end,"
2295,ARGUMENT,If either thou beheld'st with thine own eyes                     400
2296,ARGUMENT,"His death, or from some wand'rer of the Greeks"
2297,ARGUMENT,"Hast heard it; for no common woes, alas!"
2298,ARGUMENT,Was he ordain'd to share ev'n from the womb.
2299,ARGUMENT,Neither through pity or o'erstrain'd respect
2300,ARGUMENT,"Flatter me, but explicit all relate"
2301,ARGUMENT,Which thou hast witness'd. If my noble Sire
2302,ARGUMENT,E'er gratified thee by performance just
2303,ARGUMENT,"Of word or deed at Ilium, where ye fell"
2304,ARGUMENT,"So num'rous slain in fight, oh recollect"
2305,ARGUMENT,"Now his fidelity, and tell me true!                              410"
2306,ARGUMENT,"Then Menelaus, sighing deep, replied."
2307,ARGUMENT,Gods! their ambition is to reach the bed
2308,ARGUMENT,"Of a brave man, however base themselves."
2309,ARGUMENT,"But as it chances, when the hart hath lay'd"
2310,ARGUMENT,"Her fawns new-yean'd and sucklings yet, to rest"
2311,ARGUMENT,"Within some dreadful lion's gloomy den,"
2312,ARGUMENT,"She roams the hills, and in the grassy vales"
2313,ARGUMENT,"Feeds heedless, till the lion, to his lair"
2314,ARGUMENT,"Return'd, destroys her and her little-ones,"
2315,ARGUMENT,So them thy Sire shall terribly destroy.                         420
2316,ARGUMENT,"Jove, Pallas and Apollo! oh that such"
2317,ARGUMENT,"As erst in well-built Lesbos, where he strove"
2318,ARGUMENT,"With Philomelides, and threw him flat,"
2319,ARGUMENT,"A sight at which Achaia's sons rejoic'd,"
2320,ARGUMENT,"Such, now, Ulysses might assail them all!"
2321,ARGUMENT,Short life and bitter nuptials should be theirs.
2322,ARGUMENT,But thy enquiries neither indirect
2323,ARGUMENT,"Will I evade, nor give thee false reply,"
2324,ARGUMENT,But all that from the Antient of the Deep[14]
2325,ARGUMENT,"I have receiv'd will utter, hiding nought.                       430"
2326,ARGUMENT,As yet the Gods on Ægypt's shore detained
2327,ARGUMENT,"Me wishing home, angry at my neglect"
2328,ARGUMENT,To heap their altars with slain hecatombs.
2329,ARGUMENT,For they exacted from us evermore
2330,ARGUMENT,Strict rev'rence of their laws. There is an isle
2331,ARGUMENT,"Amid the billowy flood, Pharos by name,"
2332,ARGUMENT,"In front of Ægypt, distant from her shore"
2333,ARGUMENT,Far as a vessel by a sprightly gale
2334,ARGUMENT,"Impell'd, may push her voyage in a day."
2335,ARGUMENT,"The haven there is good, and many a ship                         440"
2336,ARGUMENT,Finds wat'ring there from riv'lets on the coast.
2337,ARGUMENT,"There me the Gods kept twenty days, no breeze"
2338,ARGUMENT,"Propitious granting, that might sweep the waves,"
2339,ARGUMENT,And usher to her home the flying bark.
2340,ARGUMENT,"And now had our provision, all consumed,"
2341,ARGUMENT,"Left us exhausted, but a certain nymph"
2342,ARGUMENT,Pitying saved me. Daughter fair was she
2343,ARGUMENT,"Of mighty Proteus, Antient of the Deep,"
2344,ARGUMENT,Idothea named; her most my sorrows moved;
2345,ARGUMENT,She found me from my followers all apart                         450
2346,ARGUMENT,"Wand'ring (for they around the isle, with hooks"
2347,ARGUMENT,"The fishes snaring roamed, by famine urged)"
2348,ARGUMENT,"And standing at my side, me thus bespake."
2349,ARGUMENT,"Stranger! thou must be ideot born, or weak"
2350,ARGUMENT,"At least in intellect, or thy delight"
2351,ARGUMENT,"Is in distress and mis'ry, who delay'st"
2352,ARGUMENT,"To leave this island, and no egress hence"
2353,ARGUMENT,"Canst find, although thy famish'd people faint."
2354,ARGUMENT,"So spake the Goddess, and I thus replied."
2355,ARGUMENT,"I tell thee, whosoever of the Pow'rs                             460"
2356,ARGUMENT,"Divine thou art, that I am prison'd here"
2357,ARGUMENT,"Not willingly, but must have, doubtless, sinn'd"
2358,ARGUMENT,Against the deathless tenants of the skies.
2359,ARGUMENT,Yet say (for the Immortals all things know)
2360,ARGUMENT,"What God detains me, and my course forbids"
2361,ARGUMENT,Hence to my country o'er the fishy Deep?
2362,ARGUMENT,So I; to whom the Goddess all-divine.
2363,ARGUMENT,Stranger! I will inform thee true. A seer
2364,ARGUMENT,"Oracular, the Antient of the Deep,"
2365,ARGUMENT,"Immortal Proteus, the Ægyptian, haunts                           470"
2366,ARGUMENT,"These shores, familiar with all Ocean's gulphs,"
2367,ARGUMENT,And Neptune's subject. He is by report
2368,ARGUMENT,My father; him if thou art able once
2369,ARGUMENT,"To seize and bind, he will prescribe the course"
2370,ARGUMENT,"With all its measured distances, by which"
2371,ARGUMENT,Thou shalt regain secure thy native shores.
2372,ARGUMENT,"He will, moreover, at thy suit declare,"
2373,ARGUMENT,"Thou favour'd of the skies! what good, what ill"
2374,ARGUMENT,"Hath in thine house befall'n, while absent thou"
2375,ARGUMENT,Thy voyage difficult perform'st and long.                        480
2376,ARGUMENT,"She spake, and I replied--Thyself reveal"
2377,ARGUMENT,By what effectual bands I may secure
2378,ARGUMENT,"The antient Deity marine, lest, warn'd"
2379,ARGUMENT,"Of my approach, he shun me and escape."
2380,ARGUMENT,Hard task for mortal hands to bind a God!
2381,ARGUMENT,Then thus Idothea answer'd all-divine.
2382,ARGUMENT,I will inform thee true. Soon as the sun
2383,ARGUMENT,"Hath climb'd the middle heav'ns, the prophet old,"
2384,ARGUMENT,"Emerging while the breezy zephyr blows,"
2385,ARGUMENT,"And cover'd with the scum of ocean, seeks                        490"
2386,ARGUMENT,"His spacious cove, in which outstretch'd he lies."
2387,ARGUMENT,"The phocæ[15] also, rising from the waves,"
2388,ARGUMENT,"Offspring of beauteous Halosydna, sleep"
2389,ARGUMENT,"Around him, num'rous, and the fishy scent"
2390,ARGUMENT,Exhaling rank of the unfathom'd flood.
2391,ARGUMENT,Thither conducting thee at peep of day
2392,ARGUMENT,"I will dispose thee in some safe recess,"
2393,ARGUMENT,But from among thy followers thou shalt chuse
2394,ARGUMENT,The bravest three in all thy gallant fleet.
2395,ARGUMENT,And now the artifices understand                                 500
2396,ARGUMENT,Of the old prophet of the sea. The sum
2397,ARGUMENT,"Of all his phocæ numb'ring duly first,"
2398,ARGUMENT,"He will pass through them, and when all by fives"
2399,ARGUMENT,"He counted hath, will in the midst repose"
2400,ARGUMENT,"Content, as sleeps the shepherd with his flock."
2401,ARGUMENT,"When ye shall see him stretch'd, then call to mind"
2402,ARGUMENT,"That moment all your prowess, and prevent,"
2403,ARGUMENT,"Howe'er he strive impatient, his escape."
2404,ARGUMENT,"All changes trying, he will take the form"
2405,ARGUMENT,"Of ev'ry reptile on the earth, will seem                         510"
2406,ARGUMENT,"A river now, and now devouring fire;"
2407,ARGUMENT,"But hold him ye, and grasp him still the more."
2408,ARGUMENT,"And when himself shall question you, restored"
2409,ARGUMENT,To his own form in which ye found him first
2410,ARGUMENT,"Reposing, then from farther force abstain;"
2411,ARGUMENT,"Then, Hero! loose the Antient of the Deep,"
2412,ARGUMENT,"And ask him, of the Gods who checks thy course"
2413,ARGUMENT,Hence to thy country o'er the fishy flood.
2414,ARGUMENT,"So saying, she plunged into the billowy waste."
2415,ARGUMENT,"I then, in various musings lost, my ships                        520"
2416,ARGUMENT,"Along the sea-beach station'd sought again,"
2417,ARGUMENT,And when I reach'd my galley on the shore
2418,ARGUMENT,"We supp'd, and sacred night falling from heav'n,"
2419,ARGUMENT,Slept all extended on the ocean-side.
2420,ARGUMENT,"But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,"
2421,ARGUMENT,"Look'd rosy forth, pensive beside the shore"
2422,ARGUMENT,"I walk'd of Ocean, frequent to the Gods"
2423,ARGUMENT,"Praying devout, then chose the fittest three"
2424,ARGUMENT,"For bold assault, and worthiest of my trust."
2425,ARGUMENT,Meantime the Goddess from the bosom wide                         530
2426,ARGUMENT,"Of Ocean rising, brought us thence four skins"
2427,ARGUMENT,"Of phocæ, and all newly stript, a snare"
2428,ARGUMENT,Contriving subtle to deceive her Sire.
2429,ARGUMENT,"Four cradles in the sand she scoop'd, then sat"
2430,ARGUMENT,"Expecting us, who in due time approach'd;"
2431,ARGUMENT,"She lodg'd us side by side, and over each"
2432,ARGUMENT,A raw skin cast. Horrible to ourselves
2433,ARGUMENT,Proved that disguise whom the pernicious scent
2434,ARGUMENT,Of the sea-nourish'd phocæ sore annoy'd;
2435,ARGUMENT,For who would lay him down at a whale's side?                    540
2436,ARGUMENT,But she a potent remedy devised
2437,ARGUMENT,"Herself to save us, who the nostrils sooth'd"
2438,ARGUMENT,Of each with pure ambrosia thither brought
2439,ARGUMENT,"Odorous, which the fishy scent subdued."
2440,ARGUMENT,"All morning, patient watchers, there we lay;"
2441,ARGUMENT,And now the num'rous phocæ from the Deep
2442,ARGUMENT,"Emerging, slept along the shore, and he"
2443,ARGUMENT,"At noon came also, and perceiving there"
2444,ARGUMENT,"His fatted monsters, through the flock his course"
2445,ARGUMENT,"Took regular, and summ'd them; with the first                    550"
2446,ARGUMENT,"He number'd us, suspicion none of fraud"
2447,ARGUMENT,"Conceiving, then couch'd also. We, at once,"
2448,ARGUMENT,"Loud-shouting flew on him, and in our arms"
2449,ARGUMENT,Constrain'd him fast; nor the sea-prophet old
2450,ARGUMENT,Call'd not incontinent his shifts to mind.
2451,ARGUMENT,"First he became a long-maned lion grim,"
2452,ARGUMENT,"Then dragon, panther then, a savage boar,"
2453,ARGUMENT,"A limpid stream, and an o'ershadowing tree."
2454,ARGUMENT,"We persevering held him, till at length"
2455,ARGUMENT,"The Antient of the Deep, skill'd as he is                        560"
2456,ARGUMENT,"In wiles, yet weary, question'd me, and said."
2457,ARGUMENT,"Oh Atreus' son, by what confed'rate God"
2458,ARGUMENT,"Instructed liest thou in wait for me,"
2459,ARGUMENT,To seize and hold me? what is thy desire?
2460,ARGUMENT,So He; to whom thus answer I return'd.
2461,ARGUMENT,"Old Seer! thou know'st; why, fraudful, should'st thou ask?"
2462,ARGUMENT,It is because I have been prison'd long
2463,ARGUMENT,"Within this isle, whence I have sought in vain"
2464,ARGUMENT,"Deliv'rance, till my wonted courage fails."
2465,ARGUMENT,Yet say (for the Immortals all things know)                      570
2466,ARGUMENT,"What God detains me, and my course forbids"
2467,ARGUMENT,Hence to my country o'er the fishy Deep?
2468,ARGUMENT,So I; when thus the old one of the waves.
2469,ARGUMENT,But thy plain duty[16] was to have adored
2470,ARGUMENT,"Jove, first, in sacrifice, and all the Gods,"
2471,ARGUMENT,"That then embarking, by propitious gales"
2472,ARGUMENT,"Impell'd, thou might'st have reach'd thy country soon."
2473,ARGUMENT,For thou art doom'd ne'er to behold again
2474,ARGUMENT,"Thy friends, thy palace, or thy native shores,"
2475,ARGUMENT,Till thou have seen once more the hallow'd flood                 580
2476,ARGUMENT,"Of Ægypt, and with hecatombs adored"
2477,ARGUMENT,"Devout, the deathless tenants of the skies."
2478,ARGUMENT,Then will they speed thee whither thou desir'st.
2479,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and my heart broke at his words,"
2480,ARGUMENT,Which bade me pass again the gloomy gulph
2481,ARGUMENT,"To Ægypt; tedious course, and hard to atchieve!"
2482,ARGUMENT,"Yet, though in sorrow whelm'd, I thus replied."
2483,ARGUMENT,Old prophet! I will all thy will perform.
2484,ARGUMENT,"But tell me, and the truth simply reveal;"
2485,ARGUMENT,Have the Achaians with their ships arrived                       590
2486,ARGUMENT,"All safe, whom Nestor left and I, at Troy?"
2487,ARGUMENT,"Or of the Chiefs have any in their barks,"
2488,ARGUMENT,Or in their followers' arms found a dire death
2489,ARGUMENT,"Unlook'd for, since that city's siege we closed?"
2490,ARGUMENT,"I spake, when answer thus the God return'd."
2491,ARGUMENT,"Atrides, why these questions? Need is none"
2492,ARGUMENT,"That thou should'st all my secrets learn, which once"
2493,ARGUMENT,"Reveal'd, thou would'st not long dry-eyed remain."
2494,ARGUMENT,"Of those no few have died, and many live;"
2495,ARGUMENT,"But leaders, two alone, in their return                          600"
2496,ARGUMENT,Have died (thou also hast had war to wage)
2497,ARGUMENT,"And one, still living, roams the boundless sea."
2498,ARGUMENT,"Ajax,[17] surrounded by his galleys, died."
2499,ARGUMENT,"Him Neptune, first, against the bulky rocks"
2500,ARGUMENT,"The Gyræ drove, but saved him from the Deep;"
2501,ARGUMENT,"Nor had he perish'd, hated as he was"
2502,ARGUMENT,"By Pallas, but for his own impious boast"
2503,ARGUMENT,In frenzy utter'd that he would escape
2504,ARGUMENT,"The billows, even in the Gods' despight."
2505,ARGUMENT,"Neptune that speech vain-glorious hearing, grasp'd               610"
2506,ARGUMENT,"His trident, and the huge Gyræan rock"
2507,ARGUMENT,"Smiting indignant, dash'd it half away;"
2508,ARGUMENT,"Part stood, and part, on which the boaster sat"
2509,ARGUMENT,"When, first, the brainsick fury seiz'd him, fell,"
2510,ARGUMENT,Bearing him with it down into the gulphs
2511,ARGUMENT,"Of Ocean, where he drank the brine, and died."
2512,ARGUMENT,But thy own brother in his barks escaped
2513,ARGUMENT,"That fate, by Juno saved; yet when, at length,"
2514,ARGUMENT,"He should have gain'd Malea's craggy shore,"
2515,ARGUMENT,"Then, by a sudden tempest caught, he flew                        620"
2516,ARGUMENT,With many a groan far o'er the fishy Deep
2517,ARGUMENT,"To the land's utmost point, where once his home"
2518,ARGUMENT,"Thyestes had, but where Thyestes' son"
2519,ARGUMENT,"Dwelt then, Ægisthus. Easy lay his course"
2520,ARGUMENT,"And open thence, and, as it pleased the Gods,"
2521,ARGUMENT,The shifted wind soon bore them to their home.
2522,ARGUMENT,"He, high in exultation, trod the shore"
2523,ARGUMENT,"That gave him birth, kiss'd it, and, at the sight,"
2524,ARGUMENT,"The welcome sight of Greece, shed many a tear."
2525,ARGUMENT,"Yet not unseen he landed; for a spy,                             630"
2526,ARGUMENT,One whom the shrewd Ægisthus had seduced
2527,ARGUMENT,"By promise of two golden talents, mark'd"
2528,ARGUMENT,His coming from a rock where he had watch'd
2529,ARGUMENT,"The year complete, lest, passing unperceived,"
2530,ARGUMENT,The King should reassert his right in arms.
2531,ARGUMENT,"Swift flew the spy with tidings to this Lord,"
2532,ARGUMENT,"And He, incontinent, this project framed"
2533,ARGUMENT,"Insidious. Twenty men, the boldest hearts"
2534,ARGUMENT,"Of all the people, from the rest he chose,"
2535,ARGUMENT,"Whom he in ambush placed, and others charged                     640"
2536,ARGUMENT,Diligent to prepare the festal board.
2537,ARGUMENT,"With horses, then, and chariots forth he drove"
2538,ARGUMENT,"Full-fraught with mischief, and conducting home"
2539,ARGUMENT,"The unsuspicious King, amid the feast"
2540,ARGUMENT,"Slew him, as at his crib men slay an ox."
2541,ARGUMENT,"Nor of thy brother's train, nor of his train"
2542,ARGUMENT,"Who slew thy brother, one survived, but all,"
2543,ARGUMENT,"Welt'ring in blood together, there expired."
2544,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and his words beat on my heart"
2545,ARGUMENT,As they would break it. On the sands I sat                       650
2546,ARGUMENT,"Weeping, nor life nor light desiring more."
2547,ARGUMENT,"But when I had in dust roll'd me, and wept"
2548,ARGUMENT,"To full satiety, mine ear again"
2549,ARGUMENT,The oracle of Ocean thus address'd.
2550,ARGUMENT,"Sit not, O son of Atreus! weeping here"
2551,ARGUMENT,"Longer, for remedy can none be found;"
2552,ARGUMENT,"But quick arising, trial make, how best"
2553,ARGUMENT,"Thou shalt, and soonest, reach thy home again."
2554,ARGUMENT,"For either him still living thou shalt find,"
2555,ARGUMENT,"Or ere thou come, Orestes shall have slain                       660"
2556,ARGUMENT,"The traytor, and thine eyes shall see his tomb."
2557,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd, and I, afflicted as I was,"
2558,ARGUMENT,"Yet felt my spirit at that word refresh'd,"
2559,ARGUMENT,And in wing'd accents answer thus return'd.
2560,ARGUMENT,Of these I am inform'd; but name the third
2561,ARGUMENT,"Who, dead or living, on the boundless Deep"
2562,ARGUMENT,"Is still detain'd; I dread, yet wish to hear."
2563,ARGUMENT,So I; to whom thus Proteus in return.
2564,ARGUMENT,"Laertes' son, the Lord of Ithaca--"
2565,ARGUMENT,"Him in an island weeping I beheld,                               670"
2566,ARGUMENT,"Guest of the nymph Calypso, by constraint"
2567,ARGUMENT,"Her guest, and from his native land withheld"
2568,ARGUMENT,"By sad necessity; for ships well-oar'd,"
2569,ARGUMENT,"Or faithful followers hath he none, whose aid"
2570,ARGUMENT,Might speed him safely o'er the spacious flood.
2571,ARGUMENT,"But, Menelaus dear to Jove! thy fate"
2572,ARGUMENT,Ordains not thee the stroke of death to meet
2573,ARGUMENT,"In steed-fam'd Argos, but far hence the Gods"
2574,ARGUMENT,"Will send thee to Elysium, and the earth's"
2575,ARGUMENT,"Extremest bounds; (there Rhadamanthus dwells,                    680"
2576,ARGUMENT,"The golden-hair'd, and there the human kind"
2577,ARGUMENT,"Enjoy the easiest life; no snow is there,"
2578,ARGUMENT,"No biting winter, and no drenching show'r,"
2579,ARGUMENT,But zephyr always gently from the sea
2580,ARGUMENT,Breathes on them to refresh the happy race)
2581,ARGUMENT,For that fair Helen is by nuptial bands
2582,ARGUMENT,"Thy own, and thou art son-in-law of Jove."
2583,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he plunged into the billowy waste,"
2584,ARGUMENT,"I then, with my brave comrades to the fleet"
2585,ARGUMENT,"Return'd, deep-musing as I went, and sad.                        690"
2586,ARGUMENT,No sooner had I reach'd my ship beside
2587,ARGUMENT,"The ocean, and we all had supp'd, than night"
2588,ARGUMENT,"From heav'n fell on us, and, at ease reposed"
2589,ARGUMENT,"Along the margin of the sea, we slept."
2590,ARGUMENT,"But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,"
2591,ARGUMENT,"Look'd rosy forth, drawing our galleys down"
2592,ARGUMENT,"Into the sacred Deep, we rear'd again"
2593,ARGUMENT,"The mast, unfurl'd the sail, and to our seats"
2594,ARGUMENT,"On board returning, thresh'd the foamy flood."
2595,ARGUMENT,"Once more, at length, within the hallow'd stream                 700"
2596,ARGUMENT,"Of Ægypt mooring, on the shore I slew"
2597,ARGUMENT,"Whole hecatombs, and (the displeasure thus"
2598,ARGUMENT,Of the immortal Gods appeased) I reared
2599,ARGUMENT,To Agamemnon's never-dying fame
2600,ARGUMENT,"A tomb, and finishing it, sail'd again"
2601,ARGUMENT,"With such a gale from heaven vouchsafed, as sent"
2602,ARGUMENT,My ships swift-scudding to the shores of Greece.
2603,ARGUMENT,"But come--eleven days wait here, or twelve"
2604,ARGUMENT,"A guest with me, when I will send thee hence"
2605,ARGUMENT,"Nobly, and honour'd with illustrious gifts,                      710"
2606,ARGUMENT,"With polish'd chariot, with three princely steeds,"
2607,ARGUMENT,"And with a gorgeous cup, that to the Gods"
2608,ARGUMENT,Libation pouring ever while thou liv'st
2609,ARGUMENT,"From that same cup, thou may'st remember me."
2610,ARGUMENT,"Him, prudent, then answer'd Telemachus."
2611,ARGUMENT,"Atrides, seek not to detain me here"
2612,ARGUMENT,Long time; for though contented I could sit
2613,ARGUMENT,"The year beside thee, nor regret my home"
2614,ARGUMENT,"Or parents, (so delightful thy discourse"
2615,ARGUMENT,"Sounds in my ear) yet, even now, I know,                         720"
2616,ARGUMENT,That my attendants to the Pylian shore
2617,ARGUMENT,"Wish my return, whom thou thus long detain'st."
2618,ARGUMENT,"What boon soe'er thou giv'st me, be it such"
2619,ARGUMENT,As I may treasur'd keep; but horses none
2620,ARGUMENT,Take I to Ithaca; them rather far
2621,ARGUMENT,"Keep thou, for thy own glory. Thou art Lord"
2622,ARGUMENT,"Of an extended plain, where copious springs"
2623,ARGUMENT,"The lotus, herbage of all savours, wheat,"
2624,ARGUMENT,"Pulse, and white barley of luxuriant growth."
2625,ARGUMENT,"But Ithaca no level champaign owns,                              730"
2626,ARGUMENT,"A nursery of goats, and yet a land"
2627,ARGUMENT,Fairer than even pastures to the eye.
2628,ARGUMENT,No sea-encircled isle of ours affords
2629,ARGUMENT,"Smooth course commodious and expanse of meads,"
2630,ARGUMENT,But my own Ithaca transcends them all!
2631,ARGUMENT,"He said; the Hero Menelaus smiled,"
2632,ARGUMENT,"And stroaking tenderly his cheek, replied."
2633,ARGUMENT,Dear youth! thy speech proclaims thy noble blood.
2634,ARGUMENT,I can with ease supply thee from within
2635,ARGUMENT,"With what shall suit thee better, and the gift                   740"
2636,ARGUMENT,Of all that I possess which most excels
2637,ARGUMENT,"In beauty, and the noblest shall be thine."
2638,ARGUMENT,"I give thee, wrought elaborate, a cup"
2639,ARGUMENT,"Itself all silver, bound with lip of gold."
2640,ARGUMENT,"It is the work of Vulcan, which to me"
2641,ARGUMENT,"The Hero Phædimus imparted, King"
2642,ARGUMENT,"Of the Sidonians, when on my return"
2643,ARGUMENT,His house received me. That shall be thy own.
2644,ARGUMENT,Thus they conferr'd; and now the busy train
2645,ARGUMENT,"Of menials culinary,[18] at the gate                             750"
2646,ARGUMENT,"Enter'd of Menelaus, Chief renown'd;"
2647,ARGUMENT,"They brought him sheep, with heart-ennobling wine,"
2648,ARGUMENT,"While all their wives, their brows with frontlets bound,"
2649,ARGUMENT,Came charg'd with bread. Thus busy they prepared
2650,ARGUMENT,A banquet in the mansion of the King.
2651,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, before Ulysses' palace gate"
2652,ARGUMENT,The suitors sported with the quoit and spear
2653,ARGUMENT,"On the smooth area, customary scene"
2654,ARGUMENT,Of all their strife and angry clamour loud.
2655,ARGUMENT,"There sat Antinoüs, and the godlike youth                        760"
2656,ARGUMENT,"Eurymachus, superior to the rest"
2657,ARGUMENT,"And Chiefs among them, to whom Phronius' son"
2658,ARGUMENT,"Noëmon drawing nigh, with anxious mien"
2659,ARGUMENT,"Question'd Antinoüs, and thus began."
2660,ARGUMENT,"Know we, Antinoüs! or know we not,"
2661,ARGUMENT,When to expect Telemachus at home
2662,ARGUMENT,"Again from Pylus? in my ship he went,"
2663,ARGUMENT,"Which now I need, that I may cross the sea"
2664,ARGUMENT,"To Elis, on whose spacious plain I feed"
2665,ARGUMENT,"Twelve mares, each suckling a mule-colt as yet                   770"
2666,ARGUMENT,"Unbroken, but of which I purpose one"
2667,ARGUMENT,"To ferry thence, and break him into use."
2668,ARGUMENT,"He spake, whom they astonish'd heard; for him"
2669,ARGUMENT,"They deem'd not to Nelëian Pylus gone,"
2670,ARGUMENT,"But haply into his own fields, his flocks"
2671,ARGUMENT,"To visit, or the steward of his swine."
2672,ARGUMENT,"Then thus, Eupithes' son, Antinoüs, spake."
2673,ARGUMENT,"Say true. When sail'd he forth? of all our youth,"
2674,ARGUMENT,Whom chose he for his followers? his own train
2675,ARGUMENT,Of slaves and hirelings? hath he pow'r to effect                 780
2676,ARGUMENT,"This also? Tell me too, for I would learn--"
2677,ARGUMENT,"Took he perforce thy sable bark away,"
2678,ARGUMENT,Or gav'st it to him at his first demand?
2679,ARGUMENT,"To whom Noëmon, Phronius' son, replied."
2680,ARGUMENT,"I gave it voluntary; what could'st thou,"
2681,ARGUMENT,Should such a prince petition for thy bark
2682,ARGUMENT,In such distress? Hard were it to refuse.
2683,ARGUMENT,Brave youths (our bravest youths except yourselves)
2684,ARGUMENT,Attend him forth; and with them I observed
2685,ARGUMENT,"Mentor embarking, ruler o'er them all,                           790"
2686,ARGUMENT,"Or, if not him, a God; for such he seem'd."
2687,ARGUMENT,But this much moves my wonder. Yester-morn
2688,ARGUMENT,"I saw, at day-break, noble Mentor here,"
2689,ARGUMENT,Whom shipp'd for Pylus I had seen before.
2690,ARGUMENT,He ceas'd; and to his father's house return'd;
2691,ARGUMENT,"They, hearing, sat aghast. Their games meantime"
2692,ARGUMENT,"Finish'd, the suitors on their seats reposed,"
2693,ARGUMENT,"To whom Eupithes' son, Antinoüs, next,"
2694,ARGUMENT,Much troubled spake; a black storm overcharged
2695,ARGUMENT,"His bosom, and his vivid eyes flash'd fire.                      800"
2696,ARGUMENT,"Ye Gods, a proud exploit is here atchieved,"
2697,ARGUMENT,"This voyage of Telemachus, by us"
2698,ARGUMENT,Pronounced impracticable; yet the boy
2699,ARGUMENT,"In downright opposition to us all,"
2700,ARGUMENT,"Hath headlong launched a ship, and, with a band"
2701,ARGUMENT,"Selected from our bravest youth, is gone."
2702,ARGUMENT,"He soon will prove more mischievous, whose pow'r"
2703,ARGUMENT,"Jove wither, ere we suffer its effects!"
2704,ARGUMENT,"But give me a swift bark with twenty rowers,"
2705,ARGUMENT,"That, watching his return within the streights                   810"
2706,ARGUMENT,"Of rocky Samos and of Ithaca,"
2707,ARGUMENT,I may surprise him; so shall he have sail'd
2708,ARGUMENT,"To seek his Sire, fatally for himself."
2709,ARGUMENT,"He ceased and loud applause heard in reply,"
2710,ARGUMENT,"With warm encouragement. Then, rising all,"
2711,ARGUMENT,Into Ulysses' house at once they throng'd.
2712,ARGUMENT,Nor was Penelope left uninformed
2713,ARGUMENT,"Long time of their clandestine plottings deep,"
2714,ARGUMENT,"For herald Medon told her all, whose ear"
2715,ARGUMENT,Their councils caught while in the outer-court                   820
2716,ARGUMENT,"He stood, and they that project framed within."
2717,ARGUMENT,"Swift to Penelope the tale he bore,"
2718,ARGUMENT,"Who as he pass'd the gate, him thus address'd."
2719,ARGUMENT,"For what cause, herald! have the suitors sent"
2720,ARGUMENT,Thee foremost? Wou'd they that my maidens lay
2721,ARGUMENT,"Their tasks aside, and dress the board for them?"
2722,ARGUMENT,Here end their wooing! may they hence depart
2723,ARGUMENT,"Never, and may the banquet now prepared,"
2724,ARGUMENT,This banquet prove your last![19] who in such throngs
2725,ARGUMENT,"Here meeting, waste the patrimony fair                           830"
2726,ARGUMENT,"Of brave Telemachus; ye never, sure,"
2727,ARGUMENT,"When children, heard how gracious and how good"
2728,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses dwelt among your parents, none"
2729,ARGUMENT,"Of all his people, or in word or deed"
2730,ARGUMENT,"Injuring, as great princes oft are wont,"
2731,ARGUMENT,"By favour influenc'd now, now by disgust."
2732,ARGUMENT,He no man wrong'd at any time; but plain
2733,ARGUMENT,"Your wicked purpose in your deeds appears,"
2734,ARGUMENT,Who sense have none of benefits conferr'd.
2735,ARGUMENT,"Then Medon answer'd thus, prudent, return'd.                   840"
2736,ARGUMENT,Oh Queen! may the Gods grant this prove the worst.
2737,ARGUMENT,But greater far and heavier ills than this
2738,ARGUMENT,"The suitors plan, whose counsels Jove confound!"
2739,ARGUMENT,Their base desire and purpose are to slay
2740,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus on his return; for he,"
2741,ARGUMENT,To gather tidings of his Sire is gone
2742,ARGUMENT,"To Pylus, or to Sparta's land divine."
2743,ARGUMENT,"He said; and where she stood, her trembling knees"
2744,ARGUMENT,"Fail'd under her, and all her spirits went."
2745,ARGUMENT,"Speechless she long remain'd, tears filled her eyes,             850"
2746,ARGUMENT,And inarticulate in its passage died
2747,ARGUMENT,"Her utt'rance, till at last with pain she spake."
2748,ARGUMENT,Herald! why went my son? he hath no need
2749,ARGUMENT,"On board swift ships to ride, which are to man"
2750,ARGUMENT,His steeds that bear him over seas remote.
2751,ARGUMENT,"Went he, that, with himself, his very name"
2752,ARGUMENT,Might perish from among mankind for ever?
2753,ARGUMENT,"Then answer, thus, Medon the wise return'd."
2754,ARGUMENT,I know not whether him some God impell'd
2755,ARGUMENT,"Or his own heart to Pylus, there to hear                         860"
2756,ARGUMENT,"News of his Sire's return, or by what fate"
2757,ARGUMENT,"At least he died, if he return no more."
2758,ARGUMENT,"He said, and traversing Ulysses' courts,"
2759,ARGUMENT,Departed; she with heart consuming woe
2760,ARGUMENT,"O'erwhelm'd, no longer could endure to take"
2761,ARGUMENT,"Repose on any of her num'rous seats,"
2762,ARGUMENT,But on the threshold of her chamber-door
2763,ARGUMENT,"Lamenting sat, while all her female train"
2764,ARGUMENT,"Around her moan'd, the antient and the young,"
2765,ARGUMENT,"Whom, sobbing, thus Penelope bespake.                            870"
2766,ARGUMENT,"Hear me, ye maidens! for of women born"
2767,ARGUMENT,"Coeval with me, none hath e'er received"
2768,ARGUMENT,"Such plenteous sorrow from the Gods as I,"
2769,ARGUMENT,"Who first my noble husband lost, endued"
2770,ARGUMENT,"With courage lion-like, of all the Greeks"
2771,ARGUMENT,"The Chief with ev'ry virtue most adorn'd,"
2772,ARGUMENT,"A prince all-excellent, whose glorious praise"
2773,ARGUMENT,Through Hellas and all Argos flew diffused.
2774,ARGUMENT,"And now, my darling son,--him storms have snatch'd"
2775,ARGUMENT,"Far hence inglorious, and I knew it not.                         880"
2776,ARGUMENT,Ah treach'rous servants! conscious as ye were
2777,ARGUMENT,"Of his design, not one of you the thought"
2778,ARGUMENT,Conceived to wake me when he went on board.
2779,ARGUMENT,"For had but the report once reach'd my ear,"
2780,ARGUMENT,He either had not gone (how much soe'er
2781,ARGUMENT,He wish'd to leave me) or had left me dead.
2782,ARGUMENT,"But haste ye,--bid my antient servant come,"
2783,ARGUMENT,"Dolion, whom (when I left my father's house"
2784,ARGUMENT,"He gave me, and whose office is to attend"
2785,ARGUMENT,My num'rous garden-plants) that he may seek                      890
2786,ARGUMENT,"At once Laertes, and may tell him all,"
2787,ARGUMENT,"Who may contrive some remedy, perchance,"
2788,ARGUMENT,"Or fit expedient, and shall come abroad"
2789,ARGUMENT,To weep before the men who wish to slay
2790,ARGUMENT,"Even the prince, godlike Ulysses' son."
2791,ARGUMENT,"Then thus the gentle Euryclea spake,"
2792,ARGUMENT,Nurse of Telemachus. Alas! my Queen!
2793,ARGUMENT,"Slay me, or spare, deal with me as thou wilt,"
2794,ARGUMENT,I will confess the truth. I knew it all.
2795,ARGUMENT,I gave him all that he required from me.                         900
2796,ARGUMENT,"Both wine and bread, and, at his bidding, swore"
2797,ARGUMENT,"To tell thee nought in twelve whole days to come,"
2798,ARGUMENT,"Or till, enquiry made, thou should'st thyself"
2799,ARGUMENT,"Learn his departure, lest thou should'st impair"
2800,ARGUMENT,Thy lovely features with excess of grief.
2801,ARGUMENT,"But lave thyself, and, fresh attired, ascend"
2802,ARGUMENT,"To thy own chamber, there, with all thy train,"
2803,ARGUMENT,"To worship Pallas, who shall save, thenceforth,"
2804,ARGUMENT,"Thy son from death, what ills soe'er he meet."
2805,ARGUMENT,Add not fresh sorrows to the present woes                        910
2806,ARGUMENT,"Of the old King, for I believe not yet"
2807,ARGUMENT,Arcesias' race entirely by the Gods
2808,ARGUMENT,"Renounced, but trust that there shall still be found"
2809,ARGUMENT,"Among them, who shall dwell in royal state,"
2810,ARGUMENT,And reap the fruits of fertile fields remote.
2811,ARGUMENT,"So saying, she hush'd her sorrow, and her eyes"
2812,ARGUMENT,"No longer stream'd. Then, bathed and fresh attired,"
2813,ARGUMENT,Penelope ascended with her train
2814,ARGUMENT,"The upper palace, and a basket stored"
2815,ARGUMENT,"With hallow'd cakes off'ring, to Pallas pray'd.                  920"
2816,ARGUMENT,Hear matchless daughter of Jove Ægis-arm'd!
2817,ARGUMENT,If ever wise Ulysses offer'd here
2818,ARGUMENT,"The thighs of fatted kine or sheep to thee,"
2819,ARGUMENT,"Now mindful of his piety, preserve"
2820,ARGUMENT,"His darling son, and frustrate with a frown"
2821,ARGUMENT,The cruelty of these imperious guests!
2822,ARGUMENT,"She said, and wept aloud, whose earnest suit"
2823,ARGUMENT,Pallas received. And now the spacious hall
2824,ARGUMENT,And gloomy passages with tumult rang
2825,ARGUMENT,"And clamour of that throng, when thus, a youth,                  930"
2826,ARGUMENT,"Insolent as his fellows, dared to speak."
2827,ARGUMENT,"Much woo'd and long, the Queen at length prepares"
2828,ARGUMENT,"To chuse another mate,[20] and nought suspects"
2829,ARGUMENT,The bloody death to which her son is doom'd.
2830,ARGUMENT,"So he; but they, meantime, themselves remain'd"
2831,ARGUMENT,"Untaught, what course the dread concern elsewhere"
2832,ARGUMENT,"Had taken, whom Antinoüs thus address'd."
2833,ARGUMENT,"Sirs! one and all, I counsel you, beware"
2834,ARGUMENT,Of such bold boasting unadvised; lest one
2835,ARGUMENT,"O'erhearing you, report your words within.                       940"
2836,ARGUMENT,"No--rather thus, in silence, let us move"
2837,ARGUMENT,To an exploit so pleasant to us all.
2838,ARGUMENT,"He said, and twenty chose, the bravest there,"
2839,ARGUMENT,"With whom he sought the galley on the shore,"
2840,ARGUMENT,"Which drawing down into the deep, they placed"
2841,ARGUMENT,"The mast and sails on board, and, sitting, next,"
2842,ARGUMENT,"Each oar in order to its proper groove,"
2843,ARGUMENT,Unfurl'd and spread their canvas to the gale.
2844,ARGUMENT,"Their bold attendants, then, brought them their arms,"
2845,ARGUMENT,And soon as in deep water they had moor'd                        950
2846,ARGUMENT,"The ship, themselves embarking, supp'd on board,"
2847,ARGUMENT,And watch'd impatient for the dusk of eve.
2848,ARGUMENT,"But when Penelope, the palace stairs"
2849,ARGUMENT,"Remounting, had her upper chamber reach'd,"
2850,ARGUMENT,"There, unrefresh'd with either food or wine,"
2851,ARGUMENT,"She lay'd her down, her noble son the theme"
2852,ARGUMENT,"Of all her thoughts, whether he should escape"
2853,ARGUMENT,"His haughty foes, or perish by their hands."
2854,ARGUMENT,"Num'rous as are the lion's thoughts, who sees,"
2855,ARGUMENT,"Not without fear, a multitude with toils                         960"
2856,ARGUMENT,"Encircling him around, such num'rous thoughts"
2857,ARGUMENT,"Her bosom occupied, till sleep at length"
2858,ARGUMENT,"Invading her, she sank in soft repose."
2859,ARGUMENT,"Then Pallas, teeming with a new design,"
2860,ARGUMENT,Set forth an airy phantom in the form
2861,ARGUMENT,"Of fair Iphthima, daughter of the brave"
2862,ARGUMENT,"Icarius, and Eumelus' wedded wife"
2863,ARGUMENT,In Pheræ. Shaped like her the dream she sent
2864,ARGUMENT,Into the mansion of the godlike Chief
2865,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, with kind purpose to abate                              970"
2866,ARGUMENT,The sighs and tears of sad Penelope.
2867,ARGUMENT,"Ent'ring the chamber-portal, where the bolt"
2868,ARGUMENT,"Secured it, at her head the image stood,"
2869,ARGUMENT,"And thus, in terms compassionate, began."
2870,ARGUMENT,"Sleep'st thou, distress'd Penelope? The Gods,"
2871,ARGUMENT,"Happy in everlasting rest themselves,"
2872,ARGUMENT,Forbid thy sorrows. Thou shalt yet behold

3109,ARGUMENT,For fate ordains him not to perish here
3110,ARGUMENT,"From all his friends remote, but he is doom'd"
3111,ARGUMENT,"To see them yet again, and to arrive"

3115,ARGUMENT,"Ye are unjust, ye Gods, and envious past"

3118,ARGUMENT,"So, when the rosy-finger'd Morning chose"
3119,ARGUMENT,"Orion, though ye live yourselves at ease,"
3120,ARGUMENT,"Yet ye all envied her, until the chaste"
3121,ARGUMENT,Diana from her golden throne dispatch'd
3122,ARGUMENT,"A silent shaft, which slew him in Ortygia."
3123,ARGUMENT,"So, when the golden-tressed Ceres, urged"
3124,ARGUMENT,"By passion, took Iäsion to her arms"
3125,ARGUMENT,"In a thrice-labour'd fallow, not untaught"
3126,ARGUMENT,"Was Jove that secret long, and, hearing it,"
3127,ARGUMENT,"Indignant, slew him with his candent bolt.                       150"
3128,ARGUMENT,"So also, O ye Gods, ye envy me"
3129,ARGUMENT,"The mortal man, my comfort. Him I saved"
3130,ARGUMENT,"Myself, while solitary on his keel"
3131,ARGUMENT,"He rode, for with his sulph'rous arrow Jove"
3132,ARGUMENT,Had cleft his bark amid the sable Deep.
3133,ARGUMENT,"Then perish'd all his gallant friends, but him"
3134,ARGUMENT,"Billows and storms drove hither, whom I lov'd"
3135,ARGUMENT,"Sincere, and fondly destin'd to a life"
3136,ARGUMENT,"Immortal, unobnoxious to decay."
3137,ARGUMENT,But since no Deity may the designs                               160
3138,ARGUMENT,"Elude or controvert of Jove supreme,"
3139,ARGUMENT,"Hence with him o'er the barren Deep, if such"
3140,ARGUMENT,"The Sov'reign's will, and such his stern command."
3141,ARGUMENT,"But undismiss'd he goes by me, who ships"
3142,ARGUMENT,Myself well-oar'd and mariners have none
3143,ARGUMENT,To send with him athwart the spacious flood;
3144,ARGUMENT,"Yet freely, readily, my best advice"
3145,ARGUMENT,"I will afford him, that, escaping all"
3146,ARGUMENT,"Danger, he may regain his native shore."
3147,ARGUMENT,"Then Hermes thus, the messenger of heav'n.                     170"
3148,ARGUMENT,"Act as thou say'st, fearing the frown of Jove,"
3149,ARGUMENT,"Lest, if provoked, he spare not even thee."
3150,ARGUMENT,"So saying, the dauntless Argicide withdrew,"
3151,ARGUMENT,"And she (Jove's mandate heard) all-graceful went,"
3152,ARGUMENT,Seeking the brave Ulysses; on the shore
3153,ARGUMENT,She found him seated; tears succeeding tears
3154,ARGUMENT,"Delug'd his eyes, while, hopeless of return,"
3155,ARGUMENT,Life's precious hours to eating cares he gave
3156,ARGUMENT,"Continual, with the nymph now charm'd no more."
3157,ARGUMENT,"Yet, cold as she was am'rous, still he pass'd                    180"
3158,ARGUMENT,"His nights beside her in the hollow grot,"
3159,ARGUMENT,"Constrain'd, and day by day the rocks among"
3160,ARGUMENT,"Which lined the shore heart-broken sat, and oft"
3161,ARGUMENT,"While wistfully he eyed the barren Deep,"
3162,ARGUMENT,"Wept, groaned, desponded, sigh'd, and wept again."
3163,ARGUMENT,"Then, drawing near, thus spake the nymph divine."
3164,ARGUMENT,"Unhappy! weep not here, nor life consume"
3165,ARGUMENT,In anguish; go; thou hast my glad consent.
3166,ARGUMENT,Arise to labour; hewing down the trunks
3167,ARGUMENT,"Of lofty trees, fashion them with the ax                         190"
3168,ARGUMENT,"To a broad raft, which closely floor'd above,"
3169,ARGUMENT,Shall hence convey thee o'er the gloomy Deep.
3170,ARGUMENT,"Bread, water, and the red grape's cheering juice"
3171,ARGUMENT,"Myself will put on board, which shall preserve"
3172,ARGUMENT,Thy life from famine; I will also give
3173,ARGUMENT,"New raiment for thy limbs, and will dispatch"
3174,ARGUMENT,"Winds after thee to waft thee home unharm'd,"
3175,ARGUMENT,If such the pleasure of the Gods who dwell
3176,ARGUMENT,"In yonder boundless heav'n, superior far"
3177,ARGUMENT,"To me, in knowledge and in skill to judge.                       200"
3178,ARGUMENT,She ceas'd; but horror at that sound the heart
3179,ARGUMENT,"Chill'd of Ulysses, and in accents wing'd"
3180,ARGUMENT,"With wonder, thus the noble Chief replied."
3181,ARGUMENT,Ah! other thoughts than of my safe return
3182,ARGUMENT,"Employ thee, Goddess, now, who bid'st me pass"
3183,ARGUMENT,"The perilous gulph of Ocean on a raft,"
3184,ARGUMENT,"That wild expanse terrible, which even ships"
3185,ARGUMENT,"Pass not, though form'd to cleave their way with ease,"
3186,ARGUMENT,And joyful in propitious winds from Jove.
3187,ARGUMENT,"No--let me never, in despight of thee,                           210"
3188,ARGUMENT,"Embark on board a raft, nor till thou swear,"
3189,ARGUMENT,"O Goddess! the inviolable oath,"
3190,ARGUMENT,That future mischief thou intend'st me none.
3191,ARGUMENT,"He said; Calypso, beauteous Goddess, smiled,"
3192,ARGUMENT,"And, while she spake, stroaking his cheek, replied."
3193,ARGUMENT,"Thou dost asperse me rudely, and excuse"
3194,ARGUMENT,"Of ignorance hast none, far better taught;"
3195,ARGUMENT,What words were these? How could'st thou thus reply?
3196,ARGUMENT,"Now hear me Earth, and the wide Heav'n above!"
3197,ARGUMENT,"Hear, too, ye waters of the Stygian stream                       220"
3198,ARGUMENT,Under the earth (by which the blessed Gods
3199,ARGUMENT,"Swear trembling, and revere the awful oath!)"
3200,ARGUMENT,That future mischief I intend thee none.
3201,ARGUMENT,"No, my designs concerning thee are such"
3202,ARGUMENT,"As, in an exigence resembling thine,"
3203,ARGUMENT,"Myself, most sure, should for myself conceive."
3204,ARGUMENT,"I have a mind more equal, not of steel"
3205,ARGUMENT,"My heart is form'd, but much to pity inclined."
3206,ARGUMENT,"So saying, the lovely Goddess with swift pace"
3207,ARGUMENT,"Led on, whose footsteps he as swift pursued.                     230"
3208,ARGUMENT,"Within the vaulted cavern they arrived,"
3209,ARGUMENT,The Goddess and the man; on the same throne
3210,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses sat, whence Hermes had aris'n,"
3211,ARGUMENT,"And viands of all kinds, such as sustain"
3212,ARGUMENT,"The life of mortal man, Calypso placed"
3213,ARGUMENT,"Before him, both for bev'rage and for food."
3214,ARGUMENT,She opposite to the illustrious Chief
3215,ARGUMENT,"Reposed, by her attendant maidens served"
3216,ARGUMENT,With nectar and ambrosia. They their hands
3217,ARGUMENT,"Stretch'd forth together to the ready feast,                     240"
3218,ARGUMENT,And when nor hunger more nor thirst remain'd
3219,ARGUMENT,"Unsated, thus the beauteous nymph began."
3220,ARGUMENT,"Laertes' noble son, for wisdom famed"
3221,ARGUMENT,And artifice! oh canst thou thus resolve
3222,ARGUMENT,"To seek, incontinent, thy native shores?"
3223,ARGUMENT,I pardon thee. Farewell! but could'st thou guess
3224,ARGUMENT,The woes which fate ordains thee to endure
3225,ARGUMENT,"Ere yet thou reach thy country, well-content"
3226,ARGUMENT,"Here to inhabit, thou would'st keep my grot"
3227,ARGUMENT,"And be immortal, howsoe'er thy wife                              250"
3228,ARGUMENT,Engage thy ev'ry wish day after day.
3229,ARGUMENT,Yet can I not in stature or in form
3230,ARGUMENT,"Myself suspect inferior aught to her,"
3231,ARGUMENT,Since competition cannot be between
3232,ARGUMENT,"Mere mortal beauties, and a form divine."
3233,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
3234,ARGUMENT,Awful Divinity! be not incensed.
3235,ARGUMENT,I know that my Penelope in form
3236,ARGUMENT,"And stature altogether yields to thee,"
3237,ARGUMENT,"For she is mortal, and immortal thou,                            260"
3238,ARGUMENT,From age exempt; yet not the less I wish
3239,ARGUMENT,"My home, and languish daily to return."
3240,ARGUMENT,But should some God amid the sable Deep
3241,ARGUMENT,"Dash me again into a wreck, my soul"
3242,ARGUMENT,"Shall bear _that_ also; for, by practice taught,"
3243,ARGUMENT,"I have learned patience, having much endured"
3244,ARGUMENT,By tempest and in battle both. Come then
3245,ARGUMENT,This evil also! I am well prepared.
3246,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and the sun sinking, resign'd"
3247,ARGUMENT,The earth to darkness. Then in a recess                          270
3248,ARGUMENT,"Interior of the cavern, side by side"
3249,ARGUMENT,"Reposed, they took their amorous delight."
3250,ARGUMENT,"But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,"
3251,ARGUMENT,"Look'd rosy forth, Ulysses then in haste"
3252,ARGUMENT,"Put on his vest and mantle, and, the nymph"
3253,ARGUMENT,"Her snowy vesture of transparent woof,"
3254,ARGUMENT,"Graceful, redundant; to her waist she bound"
3255,ARGUMENT,"Her golden zone, and veil'd her beauteous head,"
3256,ARGUMENT,"Then, musing, plann'd the noble Chief's return."
3257,ARGUMENT,"She gave him, fitted to the grasp, an ax                         280"
3258,ARGUMENT,"Of iron, pond'rous, double-edg'd, with haft"
3259,ARGUMENT,"Of olive-wood, inserted firm, and wrought"
3260,ARGUMENT,"With curious art. Then, placing in his hand"
3261,ARGUMENT,"A polish'd adze, she led, herself, the way"
3262,ARGUMENT,"To her isles' utmost verge, where tallest trees"
3263,ARGUMENT,"But dry long since and sapless stood, which best"
3264,ARGUMENT,"Might serve his purposes, as buoyant most,"
3265,ARGUMENT,"The alder, poplar, and cloud-piercing fir."
3266,ARGUMENT,"To that tall grove she led and left him there,"
3267,ARGUMENT,"Seeking her grot again. Then slept not He,                       290"
3268,ARGUMENT,"But, swinging with both hands the ax, his task"
3269,ARGUMENT,Soon finish'd; trees full twenty to the ground
3270,ARGUMENT,"He cast, which, dext'rous, with his adze he smooth'd,"
3271,ARGUMENT,The knotted surface chipping by a line.
3272,ARGUMENT,Meantime the lovely Goddess to his aid
3273,ARGUMENT,"Sharp augres brought, with which he bored the beams,"
3274,ARGUMENT,"Then, side by side placing them, fitted each"
3275,ARGUMENT,"To other, and with long cramps join'd them all."
3276,ARGUMENT,"Broad as an artist, skill'd in naval works,"
3277,ARGUMENT,"The bottom of a ship of burthen spreads,                         300"
3278,ARGUMENT,Such breadth Ulysses to his raft assign'd.
3279,ARGUMENT,"He deck'd her over with long planks, upborne"
3280,ARGUMENT,"On massy beams; He made the mast, to which"
3281,ARGUMENT,He added suitable the yard;--he framed
3282,ARGUMENT,"Rudder and helm to regulate her course,"
3283,ARGUMENT,With wicker-work he border'd all her length
3284,ARGUMENT,"For safety, and much ballast stow'd within."
3285,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, Calypso brought him for a sail"
3286,ARGUMENT,"Fittest materials, which he also shaped,"
3287,ARGUMENT,And to his sail due furniture annex'd                            310
3288,ARGUMENT,"Of cordage strong, foot-ropes, and ropes aloft,"
3289,ARGUMENT,Then heav'd her down with levers to the Deep.
3290,ARGUMENT,"He finish'd all his work on the fourth day,"
3291,ARGUMENT,"And on the fifth, Calypso, nymph divine,"
3292,ARGUMENT,"Dismiss'd him from her isle, but laved him first,"
3293,ARGUMENT,And cloath'd him in sweet-scented garments new.
3294,ARGUMENT,"Two skins the Goddess also placed on board,"
3295,ARGUMENT,"One charg'd with crimson wine, and ampler one"
3296,ARGUMENT,"With water, nor a bag with food replete"
3297,ARGUMENT,"Forgot, nutritious, grateful to the taste,                       320"
3298,ARGUMENT,"Nor yet, her latest gift, a gentle gale"
3299,ARGUMENT,"And manageable, which Ulysses spread,"
3300,ARGUMENT,"Exulting, all his canvas to receive."
3301,ARGUMENT,"Beside the helm he sat, steering expert,"
3302,ARGUMENT,Nor sleep fell ever on his eyes that watch'd
3303,ARGUMENT,"Intent the Pleiads, tardy in decline"
3304,ARGUMENT,"Bootes, and the Bear, call'd else the Wain,"
3305,ARGUMENT,"Which, in his polar prison circling, looks"
3306,ARGUMENT,"Direct toward Orion, and alone"
3307,ARGUMENT,Of these sinks never to the briny Deep.                          330
3308,ARGUMENT,That star the lovely Goddess bade him hold
3309,ARGUMENT,Continual on his left through all his course.
3310,ARGUMENT,"Ten days and sev'n, he, navigating, cleav'd"
3311,ARGUMENT,"The brine, and on the eighteenth day, at length,"
3312,ARGUMENT,The shadowy mountains of Phæacia's land
3313,ARGUMENT,"Descried, where nearest to his course it lay"
3314,ARGUMENT,Like a broad buckler on the waves afloat.
3315,ARGUMENT,"But Neptune, now returning from the land"
3316,ARGUMENT,"Of Ethiopia, mark'd him on his raft"
3317,ARGUMENT,"Skimming the billows, from the mountain-tops                     340"
3318,ARGUMENT,Of distant Solyma.[21] With tenfold wrath
3319,ARGUMENT,"Inflamed that sight he view'd, his brows he shook,"
3320,ARGUMENT,"And thus within himself, indignant, spake."
3321,ARGUMENT,"So then--new counsels in the skies, it seems,"
3322,ARGUMENT,"Propitious to Ulysses, have prevail'd"
3323,ARGUMENT,Since Æthiopia hath been my abode.
3324,ARGUMENT,"He sees Phæacia nigh, where he must leap"
3325,ARGUMENT,The bound'ry of his woes; but ere that hour
3326,ARGUMENT,"Arrive, I will ensure him many a groan."
3327,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he grasp'd his trident, gather'd dense              350"
3328,ARGUMENT,The clouds and troubled ocean; ev'ry storm
3329,ARGUMENT,"From ev'ry point he summon'd, earth and sea"
3330,ARGUMENT,"Darkening, and the night fell black from heav'n."
3331,ARGUMENT,"The East, the South, the heavy-blowing West,"
3332,ARGUMENT,"And the cold North-wind clear, assail'd at once"
3333,ARGUMENT,"His raft, and heaved on high the billowy flood."
3334,ARGUMENT,"All hope, all courage, in that moment, lost,"
3335,ARGUMENT,The Hero thus within himself complain'd.
3336,ARGUMENT,"Wretch that I am, what destiny at last"
3337,ARGUMENT,Attends me! much I fear the Goddess' words                       360
3338,ARGUMENT,"All true, which threaten'd me with num'rous ills"
3339,ARGUMENT,"On the wide sea, ere I should reach my home."
3340,ARGUMENT,Behold them all fulfill'd! with what a storm
3341,ARGUMENT,"Jove hangs the heav'ns, and agitates the Deep!"
3342,ARGUMENT,The winds combined beat on me. Now I sink!
3343,ARGUMENT,"Thrice blest, and more than thrice, Achaia's sons"
3344,ARGUMENT,At Ilium slain for the Atridæ' sake!
3345,ARGUMENT,"Ah, would to heav'n that, dying, I had felt"
3346,ARGUMENT,"That day the stroke of fate, when me the dead"
3347,ARGUMENT,"Achilles guarding, with a thousand spears                        370"
3348,ARGUMENT,Troy's furious host assail'd! Funereal rites
3349,ARGUMENT,"I then had shared, and praise from ev'ry Greek,"
3350,ARGUMENT,Whom now the most inglorious death awaits.
3351,ARGUMENT,"While thus he spake, a billow on his head"
3352,ARGUMENT,"Bursting impetuous, whirl'd the raft around,"
3353,ARGUMENT,"And, dashing from his grasp the helm, himself"
3354,ARGUMENT,Plunged far remote. Then came a sudden gust
3355,ARGUMENT,"Of mingling winds, that in the middle snapp'd"
3356,ARGUMENT,"His mast, and, hurried o'er the waves afar,"
3357,ARGUMENT,Both sail and sail-yard fell into the flood.                     380
3358,ARGUMENT,"Long time submerged he lay, nor could with ease"
3359,ARGUMENT,"The violence of that dread shock surmount,"
3360,ARGUMENT,"Or rise to air again, so burthensome"
3361,ARGUMENT,"His drench'd apparel proved; but, at the last,"
3362,ARGUMENT,"He rose, and, rising, sputter'd from his lips"
3363,ARGUMENT,The brine that trickled copious from his brows.
3364,ARGUMENT,"Nor, harass'd as he was, resign'd he yet"
3365,ARGUMENT,"His raft, but buffetting the waves aside"
3366,ARGUMENT,"With desp'rate efforts, seized it, and again"
3367,ARGUMENT,"Fast seated on the middle deck, escaped.                         390"
3368,ARGUMENT,"Then roll'd the raft at random in the flood,"
3369,ARGUMENT,"Wallowing unwieldy, toss'd from wave to wave."
3370,ARGUMENT,"As when in autumn, Boreas o'er the plain"
3371,ARGUMENT,"Conglomerated thorns before him drives,"
3372,ARGUMENT,"They, tangled, to each other close adhere,"
3373,ARGUMENT,So her the winds drove wild about the Deep.
3374,ARGUMENT,By turns the South consign'd her to be sport
3375,ARGUMENT,"For the rude North-wind, and, by turns, the East"
3376,ARGUMENT,Yielded her to the worrying West a prey.
3377,ARGUMENT,"But Cadmus' beauteous daughter (Ino once,                        400"
3378,ARGUMENT,Now named Leucothea) saw him; mortal erst
3379,ARGUMENT,"Was she, and trod the earth,[22] but nymph become"
3380,ARGUMENT,"Of Ocean since, in honours shares divine."
3381,ARGUMENT,"She mark'd his anguish, and, while toss'd he roam'd,"
3382,ARGUMENT,"Pitied Ulysses; from the flood, in form"
3383,ARGUMENT,"A cormorant, she flew, and on the raft"
3384,ARGUMENT,"Close-corded perching, thus the Chief address'd."
3385,ARGUMENT,Alas! unhappy! how hast thou incensed
3386,ARGUMENT,"So terribly the Shaker of the shores,"
3387,ARGUMENT,That he pursues thee with such num'rous ills?                    410
3388,ARGUMENT,"Sink thee he cannot, wish it as he may."
3389,ARGUMENT,Thus do (for I account thee not unwise)
3390,ARGUMENT,"Thy garments putting off, let drive thy raft"
3391,ARGUMENT,"As the winds will, then, swimming, strive to reach"
3392,ARGUMENT,"Phæacia, where thy doom is to escape."
3393,ARGUMENT,"Take this. This ribbon bind beneath thy breast,"
3394,ARGUMENT,Celestial texture. Thenceforth ev'ry fear
3395,ARGUMENT,"Of death dismiss, and, laying once thy hands"
3396,ARGUMENT,"On the firm continent, unbind the zone,"
3397,ARGUMENT,Which thou shalt cast far distant from the shore                 420
3398,ARGUMENT,"Into the Deep, turning thy face away."
3399,ARGUMENT,"So saying, the Goddess gave into his hand"
3400,ARGUMENT,"The wond'rous zone, and, cormorant in form,"
3401,ARGUMENT,Plunging herself into the waves again
3402,ARGUMENT,"Headlong, was hidden by the closing flood."
3403,ARGUMENT,"But still Ulysses sat perplex'd, and thus"
3404,ARGUMENT,The toil-enduring Hero reason'd sad.
3405,ARGUMENT,Alas! I tremble lest some God design
3406,ARGUMENT,"T' ensnare me yet, bidding me quit the raft."
3407,ARGUMENT,But let me well beware how I obey                                430
3408,ARGUMENT,"Too soon that precept, for I saw the land"
3409,ARGUMENT,Of my foretold deliv'rance far remote.
3410,ARGUMENT,"Thus, therefore, will I do, for such appears"
3411,ARGUMENT,My wiser course. So long as yet the planks
3412,ARGUMENT,"Mutual adhere, continuing on board"
3413,ARGUMENT,"My raft, I will endure whatever woes,"
3414,ARGUMENT,"But when the waves shall shatter it, I will swim,"
3415,ARGUMENT,"My sole resource then left. While thus he mused,"
3416,ARGUMENT,Neptune a billow of enormous bulk
3417,ARGUMENT,Hollow'd into an overwhelming arch                               440
3418,ARGUMENT,"On high up-heaving, smote him. As the wind"
3419,ARGUMENT,"Tempestuous, falling on some stubble-heap,"
3420,ARGUMENT,"The arid straws dissipates ev'ry way,"
3421,ARGUMENT,"So flew the timbers. He, a single beam"
3422,ARGUMENT,"Bestriding, oar'd it onward with his feet,"
3423,ARGUMENT,"As he had urged an horse. His raiment, then,"
3424,ARGUMENT,"Gift of Calypso, putting off, he bound"
3425,ARGUMENT,"His girdle on, and prone into the sea"
3426,ARGUMENT,"With wide-spread palms prepar'd for swimming, fell."
3427,ARGUMENT,Shore-shaker Neptune noted him; he shook                         450
3428,ARGUMENT,"His awful brows, and in his heart he said,"
3429,ARGUMENT,"Thus, suff'ring many mis'ries roam the flood,"
3430,ARGUMENT,Till thou shalt mingle with a race of men
3431,ARGUMENT,Heav'n's special favourites; yet even there
3432,ARGUMENT,Fear not that thou shalt feel thy sorrows light.
3433,ARGUMENT,"He said, and scourging his bright steeds, arrived"
3434,ARGUMENT,"At Ægæ, where his glorious palace stands."
3435,ARGUMENT,But other thoughts Minerva's mind employ'd
3436,ARGUMENT,"Jove's daughter; ev'ry wind binding beside,"
3437,ARGUMENT,"She lull'd them, and enjoin'd them all to sleep,                 460"
3438,ARGUMENT,"But roused swift Boreas, and the billows broke"
3439,ARGUMENT,"Before Ulysses, that, deliver'd safe"
3440,ARGUMENT,"From a dire death, the noble Chief might mix"
3441,ARGUMENT,With maritime Phæacia's sons renown'd.
3442,ARGUMENT,"Two nights he wander'd, and two days, the flood"
3443,ARGUMENT,"Tempestuous, death expecting ev'ry hour;"
3444,ARGUMENT,"But when Aurora, radiant-hair'd, had brought"
3445,ARGUMENT,"The third day to a close, then ceas'd the wind,"
3446,ARGUMENT,"And breathless came a calm; he, nigh at hand"
3447,ARGUMENT,"The shore beheld, darting acute his sight                        470"
3448,ARGUMENT,"Toward it, from a billow's tow'ring top."
3449,ARGUMENT,Precious as to his children seems the life
3450,ARGUMENT,Of some fond father through disease long time
3451,ARGUMENT,"And pain stretch'd languid on his couch, the prey"
3452,ARGUMENT,"Of some vindictive Pow'r, but now, at last,"
3453,ARGUMENT,"By gracious heav'n to ease and health restored,"
3454,ARGUMENT,So grateful to Ulysses' sight appear'd
3455,ARGUMENT,Forests and hills. Impatient with his feet
3456,ARGUMENT,"To press the shore, he swam; but when within"
3457,ARGUMENT,"Such distance as a shout may fly, he came,                       480"
3458,ARGUMENT,The thunder of the sea against the rocks
3459,ARGUMENT,Then smote his ear; for hoarse the billows roar'd
3460,ARGUMENT,"On the firm land, belch'd horrible abroad,"
3461,ARGUMENT,And the salt spray dimm'd all things to his view.
3462,ARGUMENT,For neither port for ships nor shelt'ring cove
3463,ARGUMENT,"Was there, but the rude coast a headland bluff"
3464,ARGUMENT,"Presented, rocks and craggy masses huge."
3465,ARGUMENT,"Then, hope and strength exhausted both, deep-groan'd"
3466,ARGUMENT,"The Chief, and in his noble heart complain'd."
3467,ARGUMENT,"Alas! though Jove hath given me to behold,                     490"
3468,ARGUMENT,"Unhoped, the land again, and I have pass'd,"
3469,ARGUMENT,"Furrowing my way, these num'rous waves, there seems"
3470,ARGUMENT,No egress from the hoary flood for me.
3471,ARGUMENT,Sharp stones hem in the waters; wild the surge
3472,ARGUMENT,Raves ev'ry where; and smooth the rocks arise;
3473,ARGUMENT,"Deep also is the shore, on which my feet"
3474,ARGUMENT,"No standing gain, or chance of safe escape."
3475,ARGUMENT,What if some billow catch me from the Deep
3476,ARGUMENT,"Emerging, and against the pointed rocks"
3477,ARGUMENT,Dash me conflicting with its force in vain?                      500
3478,ARGUMENT,"But should I, swimming, trace the coast in search"
3479,ARGUMENT,"Of sloping beach, haven or shelter'd creek,"
3480,ARGUMENT,"I fear lest, groaning, I be snatch'd again"
3481,ARGUMENT,"By stormy gusts into the fishy Deep,"
3482,ARGUMENT,Or lest some monster of the flood receive
3483,ARGUMENT,"Command to seize me, of the many such"
3484,ARGUMENT,By the illustrious Amphitrite bred;
3485,ARGUMENT,For that the mighty Shaker of the shores
3486,ARGUMENT,"Hates me implacable, too well I know."
3487,ARGUMENT,"While such discourse within himself he held,                   510"
3488,ARGUMENT,"A huge wave heav'd him on the rugged coast,"
3489,ARGUMENT,"Where flay'd his flesh had been, and all his bones"
3490,ARGUMENT,"Broken together, but for the infused"
3491,ARGUMENT,Good counsel of Minerva azure-eyed.
3492,ARGUMENT,"With both hands suddenly he seized the rock,"
3493,ARGUMENT,"And, groaning, clench'd it till the billow pass'd."
3494,ARGUMENT,So baffled he that wave; but yet again
3495,ARGUMENT,"The refluent flood rush'd on him, and with force"
3496,ARGUMENT,Resistless dash'd him far into the sea.
3497,ARGUMENT,As pebbles to the hollow polypus                                 520
3498,ARGUMENT,"Extracted from his stony bed, adhere,"
3499,ARGUMENT,"So he, the rough rocks clasping, stripp'd his hands"
3500,ARGUMENT,"Raw, and the billows now whelm'd him again."
3501,ARGUMENT,Then had the hapless Hero premature
3502,ARGUMENT,"Perish'd, but for sagacity inspired"
3503,ARGUMENT,By Pallas azure-eyed. Forth from the waves
3504,ARGUMENT,"Emerging, where the surf burst on the rocks,"
3505,ARGUMENT,He coasted (looking landward as he swam)
3506,ARGUMENT,"The shore, with hope of port or level beach."
3507,ARGUMENT,"But when, still swimming, to the mouth he came                   530"
3508,ARGUMENT,"Of a smooth-sliding river, there he deem'd"
3509,ARGUMENT,"Safest th' ascent, for it was undeform'd"
3510,ARGUMENT,"By rocks, and shelter'd close from ev'ry wind."
3511,ARGUMENT,"He felt the current, and thus, ardent, pray'd."
3512,ARGUMENT,"O hear, whate'er thy name, Sov'reign, who rul'st"
3513,ARGUMENT,"This river! at whose mouth, from all the threats"
3514,ARGUMENT,"Of Neptune 'scap'd, with rapture I arrive."
3515,ARGUMENT,Even the Immortal Gods the wand'rer's pray'r
3516,ARGUMENT,"Respect, and such am I, who reach, at length,"
3517,ARGUMENT,"Thy stream, and clasp thy knees, after long toil.                540"
3518,ARGUMENT,I am thy suppliant. Oh King! pity me.
3519,ARGUMENT,He said; the river God at once repress'd
3520,ARGUMENT,"His current, and it ceas'd; smooth he prepared"
3521,ARGUMENT,"The way before Ulysses, and the land"
3522,ARGUMENT,Vouchsafed him easy at his channel's mouth.
3523,ARGUMENT,"There, once again he bent for ease his limbs"
3524,ARGUMENT,"Both arms and knees, in conflict with the floods"
3525,ARGUMENT,"Exhausted; swoln his body was all o'er,"
3526,ARGUMENT,And from his mouth and nostrils stream'd the brine.
3527,ARGUMENT,"Breathless and speechless, and of life well nigh                 550"
3528,ARGUMENT,"Bereft he lay, through dreadful toil immense."
3529,ARGUMENT,"But when, revived, his dissipated pow'rs"
3530,ARGUMENT,"He recollected, loosing from beneath"
3531,ARGUMENT,"His breast the zone divine, he cast it far"
3532,ARGUMENT,"Into the brackish stream, and a huge wave"
3533,ARGUMENT,"Returning bore it downward to the sea,"
3534,ARGUMENT,"Where Ino caught it. Then, the river's brink"
3535,ARGUMENT,"Abandoning, among the rushes prone"
3536,ARGUMENT,"He lay, kiss'd oft the soil, and sighing, said,"
3537,ARGUMENT,"Ah me! what suff'rings must I now sustain,                       560"
3538,ARGUMENT,"What doom, at last, awaits me? If I watch"
3539,ARGUMENT,"This woeful night, here, at the river's side,"
3540,ARGUMENT,"What hope but that the frost and copious dews,"
3541,ARGUMENT,"Weak as I am, my remnant small of life"
3542,ARGUMENT,"Shall quite extinguish, and the chilly air"
3543,ARGUMENT,Breath'd from the river at the dawn of day?
3544,ARGUMENT,"But if, ascending this declivity"
3545,ARGUMENT,"I gain the woods, and in some thicket sleep,"
3546,ARGUMENT,(If sleep indeed can find me overtoil'd
3547,ARGUMENT,And cold-benumb'd) then I have cause to fear                     570
3548,ARGUMENT,"Lest I be torn by wild beasts, and devour'd."
3549,ARGUMENT,"Long time he mused, but, at the last, his course"
3550,ARGUMENT,"Bent to the woods, which not remote he saw"
3551,ARGUMENT,"From the sea-brink, conspicuous on a hill."
3552,ARGUMENT,"Arrived, between two neighbour shrubs he crept,"
3553,ARGUMENT,"Both olives, this the fruitful, that the wild;"
3554,ARGUMENT,"A covert, which nor rough winds blowing moist"
3555,ARGUMENT,"Could penetrate, nor could the noon-day sun"
3556,ARGUMENT,"Smite through it, or unceasing show'rs pervade,"
3557,ARGUMENT,So thick a roof the ample branches form'd                        580
3558,ARGUMENT,Close interwoven; under these the Chief
3559,ARGUMENT,"Retiring, with industrious hands a bed"
3560,ARGUMENT,"Collected broad of leaves, which there he found"
3561,ARGUMENT,"Abundant strew'd, such store as had sufficed"
3562,ARGUMENT,"Two travellers or three for cov'ring warm,"
3563,ARGUMENT,Though winter's roughest blasts had rag'd the while.
3564,ARGUMENT,That bed with joy the suff'ring Chief renown'd
3565,ARGUMENT,"Contemplated, and occupying soon"
3566,ARGUMENT,"The middle space, hillock'd it high with leaves."
3567,ARGUMENT,As when some swain hath hidden deep his torch                    590
3568,ARGUMENT,"Beneath the embers, at the verge extreme"
3569,ARGUMENT,"Of all his farm, where, having neighbours none,"
3570,ARGUMENT,He saves a seed or two of future flame
3571,ARGUMENT,"Alive, doom'd else to fetch it from afar,"
3572,ARGUMENT,So with dry leaves Ulysses overspread
3573,ARGUMENT,"His body, on whose eyes Minerva pour'd"
3574,ARGUMENT,"The balm of sleep copious, that he might taste"
3575,ARGUMENT,"Repose again, after long toil severe."

3591,ARGUMENT,
3592,ARGUMENT,Minerva designing an interview between the daughter of Alcinoüs and
3593,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, admonishes her in a dream to carry down her clothes to the"
3594,ARGUMENT,"river, that she may wash them, and make them ready for her approaching"
3595,ARGUMENT,"nuptials. That task performed, the Princess and her train amuse"
3596,ARGUMENT,themselves with play; by accident they awake Ulysses; he comes forth from
3597,ARGUMENT,"the wood, and applies himself with much address to Nausicaa, who"
3598,ARGUMENT,"compassionating his distressed condition, and being much affected by the"
3599,ARGUMENT,"dignity of his appearance, interests herself in his favour, and conducts"
3600,ARGUMENT,him to the city.
3601,ARGUMENT,
3602,ARGUMENT,
3603,ARGUMENT,"There then the noble suff'rer lay, by sleep"
3604,ARGUMENT,"Oppress'd and labour; meantime, Pallas sought"
3605,ARGUMENT,The populous city of Phæacia's sons.
3606,ARGUMENT,"They, in old time, in Hypereia dwelt"
3607,ARGUMENT,"The spacious, neighbours of a giant race"
3608,ARGUMENT,"The haughty Cyclops, who, endued with pow'r"
3609,ARGUMENT,"Superior, troubled them with frequent wrongs."
3610,ARGUMENT,"Godlike Nausithoüs then arose, who thence"
3611,ARGUMENT,"To Scheria led them, from all nations versed"
3612,ARGUMENT,"In arts of cultivated life, remote;                               10"
3613,ARGUMENT,"With bulwarks strong their city he enclosed,"
3614,ARGUMENT,"Built houses for them, temples to the Gods,"
3615,ARGUMENT,And gave to each a portion of the soil.
3616,ARGUMENT,"But he, already by decree of fate"
3617,ARGUMENT,"Had journey'd to the shades, and in his stead"
3618,ARGUMENT,"Alcinoüs, by the Gods instructed, reign'd."
3619,ARGUMENT,To his abode Minerva azure-eyed
3620,ARGUMENT,"Repair'd, neglecting nought which might advance"
3621,ARGUMENT,Magnanimous Ulysses' safe return.
3622,ARGUMENT,"She sought the sumptuous chamber where, in form                   20"
3623,ARGUMENT,"And feature perfect as the Gods, the young"
3624,ARGUMENT,"Nausicaa, daughter of the King, reposed."
3625,ARGUMENT,Fast by the pillars of the portal lay
3626,ARGUMENT,"Two damsels, one on either side, adorn'd"
3627,ARGUMENT,"By all the Graces, and the doors were shut."
3628,ARGUMENT,"Soft as a breathing air, she stole toward"
3629,ARGUMENT,"The royal virgin's couch, and at her head"
3630,ARGUMENT,"Standing, address'd her. Daughter she appear'd"
3631,ARGUMENT,"Of Dymas, famed for maritime exploits,"
3632,ARGUMENT,Her friend and her coeval; so disguised                           30
3633,ARGUMENT,Cærulean-eyed Minerva thus began.
3634,ARGUMENT,Nausicaa! wherefore hath thy mother borne
3635,ARGUMENT,"A child so negligent? Thy garments share,"
3636,ARGUMENT,"Thy most magnificent, no thought of thine."
3637,ARGUMENT,"Yet thou must marry soon, and must provide"
3638,ARGUMENT,"Robes for thyself, and for thy nuptial train."
3639,ARGUMENT,"Thy fame, on these concerns, and honour stand;"
3640,ARGUMENT,"These managed well, thy parents shall rejoice."
3641,ARGUMENT,"The dawn appearing, let us to the place"
3642,ARGUMENT,"Of washing, where thy work-mate I will be                         40"
3643,ARGUMENT,"For speedier riddance of thy task, since soon"
3644,ARGUMENT,The days of thy virginity shall end;
3645,ARGUMENT,For thou art woo'd already by the prime
3646,ARGUMENT,"Of all Phæacia, country of thy birth."
3647,ARGUMENT,Come then--solicit at the dawn of day
3648,ARGUMENT,"Thy royal father, that he send thee forth"
3649,ARGUMENT,With mules and carriage for conveyance hence
3650,ARGUMENT,"Of thy best robes, thy mantles and thy zones."
3651,ARGUMENT,"Thus, more commodiously thou shalt perform"
3652,ARGUMENT,"The journey, for the cisterns lie remote.                         50"
3653,ARGUMENT,"So saying, Minerva, Goddess azure-eyed,"
3654,ARGUMENT,"Rose to Olympus, the reputed seat"
3655,ARGUMENT,"Eternal of the Gods, which never storms"
3656,ARGUMENT,"Disturb, rains drench, or snow invades, but calm"
3657,ARGUMENT,The expanse and cloudless shines with purest day.
3658,ARGUMENT,There the inhabitants divine rejoice
3659,ARGUMENT,"For ever, (and her admonition giv'n)"
3660,ARGUMENT,Cærulean-eyed Minerva thither flew.
3661,ARGUMENT,"Now came Aurora bright-enthroned, whose rays"
3662,ARGUMENT,Awaken'd fair Nausicaa; she her dream                             60
3663,ARGUMENT,"Remember'd wond'ring, and her parents sought"
3664,ARGUMENT,Anxious to tell them. Them she found within.
3665,ARGUMENT,"Beside the hearth her royal mother sat,"
3666,ARGUMENT,Spinning soft fleeces with sea-purple dyed
3667,ARGUMENT,"Among her menial maidens, but she met"
3668,ARGUMENT,"Her father, whom the Nobles of the land"
3669,ARGUMENT,"Had summon'd, issuing abroad to join"
3670,ARGUMENT,The illustrious Chiefs in council. At his side
3671,ARGUMENT,"She stood, and thus her filial suit preferr'd."
3672,ARGUMENT,Sir![23] wilt thou lend me of the royal wains                   70
3673,ARGUMENT,A sumpter-carriage? for I wish to bear
3674,ARGUMENT,My costly cloaths but sullied and unfit
3675,ARGUMENT,"For use, at present, to the river side."
3676,ARGUMENT,It is but seemly that thou should'st repair
3677,ARGUMENT,Thyself to consultation with the Chiefs
3678,ARGUMENT,"Of all Phæacia, clad in pure attire;"
3679,ARGUMENT,"And my own brothers five, who dwell at home,"
3680,ARGUMENT,"Two wedded, and the rest of age to wed,"
3681,ARGUMENT,"Are all desirous, when they dance, to wear"
3682,ARGUMENT,Raiment new bleach'd; all which is my concern.                    80
3683,ARGUMENT,So spake Nausicaa; for she dared not name
3684,ARGUMENT,"Her own glad nuptials to her father's ear,"
3685,ARGUMENT,"Who, conscious yet of all her drift, replied."
3686,ARGUMENT,"I grudge thee neither mules, my child, nor aught"
3687,ARGUMENT,"That thou canst ask beside. Go, and my train"
3688,ARGUMENT,Shall furnish thee a sumpter-carriage forth
3689,ARGUMENT,"High-built, strong-wheel'd, and of capacious size."
3690,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he issued his command, whom quick"
3691,ARGUMENT,His grooms obey'd. They in the court prepared
3692,ARGUMENT,"The sumpter-carriage, and adjoin'd the mules.                     90"
3693,ARGUMENT,"And now the virgin from her chamber, charged"
3694,ARGUMENT,"With raiment, came, which on the car she placed,"
3695,ARGUMENT,"And in the carriage-chest, meantime, the Queen,"
3696,ARGUMENT,"Her mother, viands of all kinds disposed,"
3697,ARGUMENT,And fill'd a skin with wine. Nausicaa rose
3698,ARGUMENT,"Into her seat; but, ere she went, received"
3699,ARGUMENT,A golden cruse of oil from the Queen's hand
3700,ARGUMENT,"For unction of herself, and of her maids."
3701,ARGUMENT,"Then, seizing scourge and reins, she lash'd the mules."
3702,ARGUMENT,"They trampled loud the soil, straining to draw                   100"
3703,ARGUMENT,Herself with all her vesture; nor alone
3704,ARGUMENT,"She went, but follow'd by her virgin train."
3705,ARGUMENT,At the delightful rivulet arrived
3706,ARGUMENT,Where those perennial cisterns were prepared
3707,ARGUMENT,With purest crystal of the fountain fed
3708,ARGUMENT,"Profuse, sufficient for the deepest stains,"
3709,ARGUMENT,"Loosing the mules, they drove them forth to browze"
3710,ARGUMENT,On the sweet herb beside the dimpled flood.
3711,ARGUMENT,"The carriage, next, light'ning, they bore in hand"
3712,ARGUMENT,"The garments down to the unsullied wave,                         110"
3713,ARGUMENT,"And thrust them heap'd into the pools, their task"
3714,ARGUMENT,"Dispatching brisk, and with an emulous haste."
3715,ARGUMENT,"When they had all purified, and no spot"
3716,ARGUMENT,"Could now be seen, or blemish more, they spread"
3717,ARGUMENT,The raiment orderly along the beach
3718,ARGUMENT,"Where dashing tides had cleansed the pebbles most,"
3719,ARGUMENT,"And laving, next, and smoothing o'er with oil"
3720,ARGUMENT,"Their limbs, all seated on the river's bank,"
3721,ARGUMENT,"They took repast, leaving the garments, stretch'd"
3722,ARGUMENT,"In noon-day fervour of the sun, to dry.                          120"
3723,ARGUMENT,"Their hunger satisfied, at once arose"
3724,ARGUMENT,"The mistress and her train, and putting off"
3725,ARGUMENT,"Their head-attire, play'd wanton with the ball,"
3726,ARGUMENT,The princess singing to her maids the while.
3727,ARGUMENT,"Such as shaft-arm'd Diana roams the hills,"
3728,ARGUMENT,"Täygetus sky-capt, or Erymanth,"
3729,ARGUMENT,"The wild boar chasing, or fleet-footed hind,"
3730,ARGUMENT,"All joy; the rural nymphs, daughters of Jove,"
3731,ARGUMENT,"Sport with her, and Latona's heart exults;"
3732,ARGUMENT,She high her graceful head above the rest                        130
3733,ARGUMENT,"And features lifts divine, though all be fair,"
3734,ARGUMENT,With ease distinguishable from them all;
3735,ARGUMENT,"So, all her train, she, virgin pure, surpass'd."
3736,ARGUMENT,But when the hour of her departure thence
3737,ARGUMENT,"Approach'd (the mules now yoked again, and all"
3738,ARGUMENT,Her elegant apparel folded neat)
3739,ARGUMENT,Minerva azure-eyed mused how to wake
3740,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, that he might behold the fair"
3741,ARGUMENT,"Virgin, his destin'd guide into the town."
3742,ARGUMENT,"The Princess, then, casting the ball toward                      140"
3743,ARGUMENT,"A maiden of her train, erroneous threw"
3744,ARGUMENT,And plunged it deep into the dimpling stream.
3745,ARGUMENT,"All shrieked; Ulysses at the sound awoke,"
3746,ARGUMENT,"And, sitting, meditated thus the cause."
3747,ARGUMENT,Ah me! what mortal race inhabit here?
3748,ARGUMENT,"Rude are they, contumacious and unjust?"
3749,ARGUMENT,"Or hospitable, and who fear the Gods?"
3750,ARGUMENT,So shrill the cry and feminine of nymphs
3751,ARGUMENT,"Fills all the air around, such as frequent"
3752,ARGUMENT,"The hills, clear fountains, and herbaceous meads.                150"
3753,ARGUMENT,Is this a neighbourhood of men endued
3754,ARGUMENT,With voice articulate? But what avails
3755,ARGUMENT,To ask; I will myself go forth and see.
3756,ARGUMENT,"So saying, divine Ulysses from beneath"
3757,ARGUMENT,"His thicket crept, and from the leafy wood"
3758,ARGUMENT,"A spreading branch pluck'd forcibly, design'd"
3759,ARGUMENT,"A decent skreen effectual, held before."
3760,ARGUMENT,"So forth he went, as goes the lion forth,"
3761,ARGUMENT,"The mountain-lion, conscious of his strength,"
3762,ARGUMENT,"Whom winds have vex'd and rains; fire fills his eyes,            160"
3763,ARGUMENT,"And whether herds or flocks, or woodland deer"
3764,ARGUMENT,"He find, he rends them, and, adust for blood,"
3765,ARGUMENT,"Abstains not even from the guarded fold,"
3766,ARGUMENT,"Such sure to seem in virgin eyes, the Chief,"
3767,ARGUMENT,"All naked as he was, left his retreat,"
3768,ARGUMENT,"Reluctant, by necessity constrain'd."
3769,ARGUMENT,"Him foul with sea foam horror-struck they view'd,"
3770,ARGUMENT,And o'er the jutting shores fled all dispersed.
3771,ARGUMENT,Nausicaa alone fled not; for her
3772,ARGUMENT,"Pallas courageous made, and from her limbs,                      170"
3773,ARGUMENT,"By pow'r divine, all tremour took away."
3774,ARGUMENT,"Firm she expected him; he doubtful stood,"
3775,ARGUMENT,"Or to implore the lovely maid, her knees"
3776,ARGUMENT,"Embracing, or aloof standing, to ask"
3777,ARGUMENT,"In gentle terms discrete the gift of cloaths,"
3778,ARGUMENT,And guidance to the city where she dwelt.
3779,ARGUMENT,"Him so deliberating, most, at length,"
3780,ARGUMENT,This counsel pleas'd; in suppliant terms aloof
3781,ARGUMENT,"To sue to her, lest if he clasp'd her knees,"
3782,ARGUMENT,The virgin should that bolder course resent.                     180
3783,ARGUMENT,"Then gentle, thus, and well-advised he spake."
3784,ARGUMENT,Oh Queen! thy earnest suppliant I approach.
3785,ARGUMENT,"Art thou some Goddess, or of mortal race?"
3786,ARGUMENT,"For if some Goddess, and from heaven arrived,"
3787,ARGUMENT,"Diana, then, daughter of mighty Jove"
3788,ARGUMENT,"I deem thee most, for such as hers appear"
3789,ARGUMENT,"Thy form, thy stature, and thy air divine."
3790,ARGUMENT,"But if, of mortal race, thou dwell below,"
3791,ARGUMENT,"Thrice happy then, thy parents I account,"
3792,ARGUMENT,And happy thrice thy brethren. Ah! the joy                       190
3793,ARGUMENT,"Which always for thy sake, their bosoms fill,"
3794,ARGUMENT,"When thee they view, all lovely as thou art,"
3795,ARGUMENT,Ent'ring majestic on the graceful dance.
3796,ARGUMENT,"But him beyond all others blest I deem,"
3797,ARGUMENT,"The youth, who, wealthier than his rich compeers,"
3798,ARGUMENT,Shall win and lead thee to his honour'd home.
3799,ARGUMENT,For never with these eyes a mortal form
3800,ARGUMENT,"Beheld I comparable aught to thine,"
3801,ARGUMENT,In man or woman. Wonder-wrapt I gaze.
3802,ARGUMENT,"Such erst, in Delos, I beheld a palm                             200"
3803,ARGUMENT,"Beside the altar of Apollo, tall,"
3804,ARGUMENT,"And growing still; (for thither too I sail'd,"
3805,ARGUMENT,And num'rous were my followers in a voyage
3806,ARGUMENT,Ordain'd my ruin) and as then I view'd
3807,ARGUMENT,"That palm long time amazed, for never grew"
3808,ARGUMENT,"So strait a shaft, so lovely from the ground,"
3809,ARGUMENT,"So, Princess! thee with wonder I behold,"
3810,ARGUMENT,"Charm'd into fixt astonishment, by awe"
3811,ARGUMENT,"Alone forbidden to embrace thy knees,"
3812,ARGUMENT,For I am one on whom much woe hath fall'n.                       210
3813,ARGUMENT,Yesterday I escaped (the twentieth day
3814,ARGUMENT,Of my distress by sea) the dreary Deep;
3815,ARGUMENT,"For, all those days, the waves and rapid storms"
3816,ARGUMENT,"Bore me along, impetuous from the isle"
3817,ARGUMENT,Ogygia; till at length the will of heav'n
3818,ARGUMENT,"Cast me, that I might also here sustain"
3819,ARGUMENT,"Affliction on your shore; for rest, I think,"
3820,ARGUMENT,Is not for me. No. The Immortal Gods
3821,ARGUMENT,Have much to accomplish ere that day arrive.
3822,ARGUMENT,"But, oh Queen, pity me! who after long                           220"
3823,ARGUMENT,"Calamities endured, of all who live"
3824,ARGUMENT,"Thee first approach, nor mortal know beside"
3825,ARGUMENT,Of the inhabitants of all the land.
3826,ARGUMENT,"Shew me your city; give me, although coarse,"
3827,ARGUMENT,Some cov'ring (if coarse cov'ring _thou_ canst give)
3828,ARGUMENT,"And may the Gods thy largest wishes grant,"
3829,ARGUMENT,"House, husband, concord! for of all the gifts"
3830,ARGUMENT,"Of heav'n, more precious none I deem, than peace"
3831,ARGUMENT,"'Twixt wedded pair, and union undissolved;"
3832,ARGUMENT,"Envy torments their enemies, but joy                             230"
3833,ARGUMENT,"Fills ev'ry virtuous breast, and most their own."
3834,ARGUMENT,To whom Nausicaa the fair replied.
3835,ARGUMENT,"Since, stranger! neither base by birth thou seem'st,"
3836,ARGUMENT,"Nor unintelligent, (but Jove, the King"
3837,ARGUMENT,"Olympian, gives to good and bad alike"
3838,ARGUMENT,"Prosperity according to his will,"
3839,ARGUMENT,"And grief to thee, which thou must patient bear,)"
3840,ARGUMENT,"Now, therefore, at our land and city arrived,"
3841,ARGUMENT,"Nor garment thou shalt want, nor aught beside"
3842,ARGUMENT,Due to a suppliant guest like thee forlorn.                      240
3843,ARGUMENT,"I will both show thee where our city stands,"
3844,ARGUMENT,And who dwell here. Phæacia's sons possess
3845,ARGUMENT,This land; but I am daughter of their King
3846,ARGUMENT,"The brave Alcinoüs, on whose sway depends"
3847,ARGUMENT,For strength and wealth the whole Phæacian race.
3848,ARGUMENT,"She said, and to her beauteous maidens gave"
3849,ARGUMENT,"Instant commandment--My attendants, stay!"
3850,ARGUMENT,"Why flee ye thus, and whither, from the sight"
3851,ARGUMENT,Of a mere mortal? Seems he in your eyes
3852,ARGUMENT,"Some enemy of ours? The heart beats not,                         250"
3853,ARGUMENT,"Nor shall it beat hereafter, which shall come"
3854,ARGUMENT,"An enemy to the Phæacian shores,"
3855,ARGUMENT,So dear to the immortal Gods are we.
3856,ARGUMENT,"Remote, amid the billowy Deep, we hold"
3857,ARGUMENT,"Our dwelling, utmost of all human-kind,"
3858,ARGUMENT,And free from mixture with a foreign race.
3859,ARGUMENT,"This man, a miserable wand'rer comes,"
3860,ARGUMENT,"Whom we are bound to cherish, for the poor"
3861,ARGUMENT,"And stranger are from Jove, and trivial gifts"
3862,ARGUMENT,To such are welcome. Bring ye therefore food                     260
3863,ARGUMENT,"And wine, my maidens, for the guest's regale,"
3864,ARGUMENT,And lave him where the stream is shelter'd most.
3865,ARGUMENT,"She spake; they stood, and by each other's words"
3866,ARGUMENT,"Encouraged, placed Ulysses where the bank"
3867,ARGUMENT,"O'erhung the stream, as fair Nausicaa bade,"
3868,ARGUMENT,Daughter of King Alcinoüs the renown'd.
3869,ARGUMENT,"Apparel also at his side they spread,"
3870,ARGUMENT,"Mantle and vest, and, next, the limpid oil"
3871,ARGUMENT,"Presenting to him in the golden cruse,"
3872,ARGUMENT,Exhorted him to bathe in the clear stream.                       270
3873,ARGUMENT,Ulysses then the maidens thus bespake.
3874,ARGUMENT,"Ye maidens, stand apart, that I may cleanse,"
3875,ARGUMENT,"Myself, my shoulders from the briny surf,"
3876,ARGUMENT,And give them oil which they have wanted long.
3877,ARGUMENT,"But in your presence I bathe not, ashamed"
3878,ARGUMENT,To show myself uncloath'd to female eyes.
3879,ARGUMENT,"He said; they went, and to Nausicaa told"
3880,ARGUMENT,His answer; then the Hero in the stream
3881,ARGUMENT,"His shoulders laved, and loins incrusted rough"
3882,ARGUMENT,"With the salt spray, and with his hands the scum                 280"
3883,ARGUMENT,Of the wild ocean from his locks express'd.
3884,ARGUMENT,"Thus wash'd all over, and refresh'd with oil,"
3885,ARGUMENT,"He put the garments on, Nausicaa's gift."
3886,ARGUMENT,"Then Pallas, progeny of Jove, his form"
3887,ARGUMENT,"Dilated more, and from his head diffused"
3888,ARGUMENT,His curling locks like hyacinthine flowers.
3889,ARGUMENT,"As when some artist, by Minerva made"
3890,ARGUMENT,And Vulcan wise to execute all tasks
3891,ARGUMENT,"Ingenious, binding with a golden verge"
3892,ARGUMENT,"Bright silver, finishes a graceful work,                         290"
3893,ARGUMENT,Such grace the Goddess o'er his ample chest
3894,ARGUMENT,"Copious diffused, and o'er his manly brows."
3895,ARGUMENT,"Retiring, on the beach he sat, with grace"
3896,ARGUMENT,"And dignity illumed, where, viewing him,"
3897,ARGUMENT,"The virgin Princess, with amazement mark'd"
3898,ARGUMENT,"His beauty, and her damsels thus bespake."
3899,ARGUMENT,"My white-arm'd maidens, listen to my voice!"
3900,ARGUMENT,"Not hated, sure, by all above, this man"
3901,ARGUMENT,Among Phæacia's godlike sons arrives.
3902,ARGUMENT,At first I deem'd him of plebeian sort                           300
3903,ARGUMENT,"Dishonourable, but he now assumes"
3904,ARGUMENT,A near resemblance to the Gods above.
3905,ARGUMENT,Ah! would to heaven it were my lot to call
3906,ARGUMENT,"Husband, some native of our land like him"
3907,ARGUMENT,"Accomplish'd, and content to inhabit here!"
3908,ARGUMENT,"Give him, my maidens, food, and give him wine."
3909,ARGUMENT,"She ended; they obedient to her will,"
3910,ARGUMENT,"Both wine and food, dispatchful, placed, and glad,"
3911,ARGUMENT,"Before Ulysses; he rapacious ate,"
3912,ARGUMENT,"Toil-suff'ring Chief, and drank, for he had lived                310"
3913,ARGUMENT,From taste of aliment long time estranged.
3914,ARGUMENT,"On other thoughts meantime intent, her charge"
3915,ARGUMENT,Of folded vestments neat the Princess placed
3916,ARGUMENT,"Within the royal wain, then yoked the mules,"
3917,ARGUMENT,"And to her seat herself ascending, call'd"
3918,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses to depart, and thus she spake."
3919,ARGUMENT,"Up, stranger! seek the city. I will lead"
3920,ARGUMENT,"Thy steps toward my royal Father's house,"
3921,ARGUMENT,Where all Phæacia's Nobles thou shalt see.
3922,ARGUMENT,But thou (for I account thee not unwise)                         320
3923,ARGUMENT,"This course pursue. While through the fields we pass,"
3924,ARGUMENT,"And labours of the rural hind, so long"
3925,ARGUMENT,With my attendants follow fast the mules
3926,ARGUMENT,And sumpter-carriage. I will be thy guide.
3927,ARGUMENT,"But, once the summit gain'd, on which is built"
3928,ARGUMENT,"Our city with proud bulwarks fenced around,"
3929,ARGUMENT,And laved on both sides by its pleasant port
3930,ARGUMENT,"Of narrow entrance, where our gallant barks"
3931,ARGUMENT,"Line all the road, each station'd in her place,"
3932,ARGUMENT,"And where, adjoining close the splendid fane                     330"
3933,ARGUMENT,"Of Neptune, stands the forum with huge stones"
3934,ARGUMENT,"From quarries thither drawn, constructed strong,"

3940,ARGUMENT,"Then, cautious, I would shun their bitter taunts"
3941,ARGUMENT,"Disgustful, lest they mock me as I pass;"
3942,ARGUMENT,For of the meaner people some are coarse                         340
3943,ARGUMENT,"In the extreme, and it may chance that one,"
3944,ARGUMENT,The basest there seeing us shall exclaim--
3945,ARGUMENT,What handsome stranger of athletic form
3946,ARGUMENT,Attends the Princess? Where had she the chance
3947,ARGUMENT,To find him? We shall see them wedded soon.
3948,ARGUMENT,Either she hath received some vagrant guest
3949,ARGUMENT,"From distant lands, (for no land neighbours ours)"
3950,ARGUMENT,"Or by her pray'rs incessant won, some God"
3951,ARGUMENT,Hath left the heav'ns to be for ever hers.

3953,ARGUMENT,"An husband for herself, since she accounts"
3954,ARGUMENT,"The Nobles of Phæacia, who her hand"
3955,ARGUMENT,"Solicit num'rous, worthy to be scorn'd--"
3956,ARGUMENT,"Thus will they speak, injurious. I should blame"
3957,ARGUMENT,"A virgin guilty of such conduct much,"
3958,ARGUMENT,"Myself, who reckless of her parents' will,"
3959,ARGUMENT,"Should so familiar with a man consort,"
3960,ARGUMENT,Ere celebration of her spousal rites.
3961,ARGUMENT,"But mark me, stranger! following my advice,"
3962,ARGUMENT,Thou shalt the sooner at my father's hands                       360
3963,ARGUMENT,Obtain safe conduct and conveyance home.
3964,ARGUMENT,Sacred to Pallas a delightful grove
3965,ARGUMENT,"Of poplars skirts the road, which we shall reach"
3966,ARGUMENT,"Ere long; within that grove a fountain flows,"
3967,ARGUMENT,And meads encircle it; my father's farm
3968,ARGUMENT,"Is there, and his luxuriant garden plot;"
3969,ARGUMENT,A shout might reach it from the city-walls.
3970,ARGUMENT,"There wait, till in the town arrived, we gain"
3971,ARGUMENT,"My father's palace, and when reason bids"
3972,ARGUMENT,"Suppose us there, then ent'ring thou the town,                   370"
3973,ARGUMENT,"Ask where Alcinoüs dwells, my valiant Sire."
3974,ARGUMENT,"Well known is his abode, so that with ease"
3975,ARGUMENT,"A child might lead thee to it, for in nought"
3976,ARGUMENT,The other houses of our land the house
3977,ARGUMENT,"Resemble, in which dwells the Hero, King"
3978,ARGUMENT,Alcinoüs. Once within the court received
3979,ARGUMENT,"Pause not, but, with swift pace advancing, seek"
3980,ARGUMENT,My mother; she beside a column sits
3981,ARGUMENT,"In the hearth's blaze, twirling her fleecy threads"
3982,ARGUMENT,"Tinged with sea-purple, bright, magnificent!                     380"
3983,ARGUMENT,With all her maidens orderly behind.
3984,ARGUMENT,"There also stands my father's throne, on which"
3985,ARGUMENT,"Seated, he drinks and banquets like a God."
3986,ARGUMENT,"Pass that; then suppliant clasp my mother's knees,"
3987,ARGUMENT,So shalt thou quickly win a glad return
3988,ARGUMENT,"To thy own home, however far remote."
3989,ARGUMENT,"Her favour, once, and her kind aid secured,"
3990,ARGUMENT,"Thenceforth thou may'st expect thy friends to see,"
3991,ARGUMENT,"Thy dwelling, and thy native soil again."
3992,ARGUMENT,"So saying, she with her splendid scourge the mules               390"
3993,ARGUMENT,Lash'd onward. They (the stream soon left behind)
3994,ARGUMENT,With even footsteps graceful smote the ground;
3995,ARGUMENT,"But so she ruled them, managing with art"
3996,ARGUMENT,"The scourge, as not to leave afar, although"
3997,ARGUMENT,"Following on foot, Ulysses and her train."
3998,ARGUMENT,"The sun had now declined, when in that grove"

4003,ARGUMENT,"Oh, hear me! Hear me now, because when erst"
4004,ARGUMENT,The mighty Shaker of the shores incensed

4006,ARGUMENT,"Grant me, among Phæacia's sons, to find"
4007,ARGUMENT,Benevolence and pity of my woes!
4008,ARGUMENT,"He spake, whose pray'r well-pleas'd the Goddess heard,"
4009,ARGUMENT,"But, rev'rencing the brother of her sire,[24]"

4032,ARGUMENT,"related to them the manner of his being cast on the shore of Scheria, and"

4071,ARGUMENT,Myself will shew thee; for not distant dwells
4072,ARGUMENT,Alcinoüs from my father's own abode:
4073,ARGUMENT,But hush! be silent--I will lead the way;
4074,ARGUMENT,Mark no man; question no man; for the sight

4076,ARGUMENT,The welcome by this people shown to such.
4077,ARGUMENT,"They, trusting in swift ships, by the free grant"
4078,ARGUMENT,"Of Neptune traverse his wide waters, borne"
4079,ARGUMENT,"As if on wings, or with the speed of thought."
4080,ARGUMENT,"So spake the Goddess, and with nimble pace"
4081,ARGUMENT,"Led on, whose footsteps he, as quick, pursued."
4082,ARGUMENT,But still the seaman-throng through whom he pass'd
4083,ARGUMENT,"Perceiv'd him not; Minerva, Goddess dread,"
4084,ARGUMENT,"That sight forbidding them, whose eyes she dimm'd"

4096,ARGUMENT,"Speed ever best, come whencesoe'er they may."
4097,ARGUMENT,"First thou shalt find the Queen, known by her name"
4098,ARGUMENT,Areta; lineal in descent from those
4099,ARGUMENT,"Who gave Alcinoüs birth, her royal spouse."
4100,ARGUMENT,"Neptune begat Nausithoüs, at the first,"
4101,ARGUMENT,"On Peribæa, loveliest of her sex,"
4102,ARGUMENT,"Latest-born daughter of Eurymedon,"
4103,ARGUMENT,"Heroic King of the proud giant race,"
4104,ARGUMENT,"Who, losing all his impious people, shared"
4105,ARGUMENT,"The same dread fate himself. Her Neptune lov'd,                   70"

4108,ARGUMENT,"Nausithoüs himself two sons begat,"
4109,ARGUMENT,Rhexenor and Alcinoüs. Phoebus slew

4115,ARGUMENT,"Existing, subjects of an husband's pow'r.                         80"
4116,ARGUMENT,Like veneration she from all receives
4117,ARGUMENT,"Unfeign'd, from her own children, from himself"
4118,ARGUMENT,"Alcinoüs, and from all Phæacia's race,"
4119,ARGUMENT,"Who, gazing on her as she were divine,"
4120,ARGUMENT,Shout when she moves in progress through the town.
4121,ARGUMENT,"For she no wisdom wants, but sits, herself,"
4122,ARGUMENT,Arbitress of such contests as arise

4124,ARGUMENT,"Her count'nance once and her kind aid secured,"
4125,ARGUMENT,"Thou may'st thenceforth expect thy friends to see,                90"
4126,ARGUMENT,"Thy dwelling, and thy native soil again."
4127,ARGUMENT,"So Pallas spake, Goddess cærulean-eyed,"
4128,ARGUMENT,And o'er the untillable and barren Deep
4129,ARGUMENT,"Departing, Scheria left, land of delight,"
4130,ARGUMENT,"Whence reaching Marathon, and Athens next,"
4131,ARGUMENT,She pass'd into Erectheus' fair abode.
4132,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, then, toward the palace moved"
4133,ARGUMENT,"Of King Alcinoüs, but immers'd in thought"
4134,ARGUMENT,"Stood, first, and paused, ere with his foot he press'd"
4135,ARGUMENT,The brazen threshold; for a light he saw                         100
4136,ARGUMENT,As of the sun or moon illuming clear
4137,ARGUMENT,The palace of Phæacia's mighty King.
4138,ARGUMENT,"Walls plated bright with brass, on either side"
4139,ARGUMENT,"Stretch'd from the portal to th' interior house,"
4140,ARGUMENT,With azure cornice crown'd; the doors were gold
4141,ARGUMENT,Which shut the palace fast; silver the posts
4142,ARGUMENT,"Rear'd on a brazen threshold, and above,"
4143,ARGUMENT,"The lintels, silver, architraved with gold."
4144,ARGUMENT,"Mastiffs, in gold and silver, lined the approach"
4145,ARGUMENT,"On either side, by art celestial framed                          110"
4146,ARGUMENT,"Of Vulcan, guardians of Alcinoüs' gate"
4147,ARGUMENT,"For ever, unobnoxious to decay."
4148,ARGUMENT,Sheer from the threshold to the inner house
4149,ARGUMENT,"Fixt thrones the walls, through all their length, adorn'd,"
4150,ARGUMENT,With mantles overspread of subtlest warp
4151,ARGUMENT,"Transparent, work of many a female hand."
4152,ARGUMENT,"On these the princes of Phæacia sat,"
4153,ARGUMENT,"Holding perpetual feasts, while golden youths"
4154,ARGUMENT,"On all the sumptuous altars stood, their hands"
4155,ARGUMENT,"With burning torches charged, which, night by night,             120"
4156,ARGUMENT,Shed radiance over all the festive throng.
4157,ARGUMENT,Full fifty female menials serv'd the King
4158,ARGUMENT,In household offices; the rapid mills
4159,ARGUMENT,"These turning, pulverize the mellow'd grain,"
4160,ARGUMENT,"Those, seated orderly, the purple fleece"
4161,ARGUMENT,"Wind off, or ply the loom, restless as leaves"
4162,ARGUMENT,Of lofty poplars fluttering in the breeze;
4163,ARGUMENT,Bright as with oil the new-wrought texture shone.[25]
4164,ARGUMENT,Far as Phæacian mariners all else
4165,ARGUMENT,"Surpass, the swift ship urging through the floods,               130"
4166,ARGUMENT,So far in tissue-work the women pass
4167,ARGUMENT,"All others, by Minerva's self endow'd"
4168,ARGUMENT,With richest fancy and superior skill.
4169,ARGUMENT,"Without the court, and to the gates adjoin'd"
4170,ARGUMENT,"A spacious garden lay, fenced all around"
4171,ARGUMENT,"Secure, four acres measuring complete."
4172,ARGUMENT,"There grew luxuriant many a lofty tree,"
4173,ARGUMENT,"Pomegranate, pear, the apple blushing bright,"
4174,ARGUMENT,"The honied fig, and unctuous olive smooth."
4175,ARGUMENT,"Those fruits, nor winter's cold nor summer's heat                140"
4176,ARGUMENT,"Fear ever, fail not, wither not, but hang"
4177,ARGUMENT,"Perennial, whose unceasing zephyr breathes"
4178,ARGUMENT,"Gently on all, enlarging these, and those"
4179,ARGUMENT,Maturing genial; in an endless course
4180,ARGUMENT,"Pears after pears to full dimensions swell,"
4181,ARGUMENT,"Figs follow figs, grapes clust'ring grow again"
4182,ARGUMENT,"Where clusters grew, and (ev'ry apple stript)"
4183,ARGUMENT,The boughs soon tempt the gath'rer as before.
4184,ARGUMENT,"There too, well-rooted, and of fruit profuse,"
4185,ARGUMENT,"His vineyard grows; part, wide-extended, basks,                  150"
4186,ARGUMENT,In the sun's beams; the arid level glows;
4187,ARGUMENT,"In part they gather, and in part they tread"
4188,ARGUMENT,"The wine-press, while, before the eye, the grapes"
4189,ARGUMENT,"Here put their blossom forth, there, gather fast"
4190,ARGUMENT,Their blackness. On the garden's verge extreme
4191,ARGUMENT,"Flow'rs of all hues smile all the year, arranged"
4192,ARGUMENT,"With neatest art judicious, and amid"
4193,ARGUMENT,"The lovely scene two fountains welling forth,"
4194,ARGUMENT,"One visits, into ev'ry part diffus'd,"
4195,ARGUMENT,"The garden-ground, the other soft beneath                        160"
4196,ARGUMENT,"The threshold steals into the palace-court,"
4197,ARGUMENT,Whence ev'ry citizen his vase supplies.
4198,ARGUMENT,Such were the ample blessings on the house
4199,ARGUMENT,Of King Alcinoüs by the Gods bestow'd.
4200,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses wond'ring stood, and when, at length,"
4201,ARGUMENT,"Silent he had the whole fair scene admired,"
4202,ARGUMENT,With rapid step enter'd the royal gate.
4203,ARGUMENT,The Chiefs he found and Senators within
4204,ARGUMENT,Libation pouring to the vigilant spy
4205,ARGUMENT,"Mercurius, whom with wine they worshipp'd last                   170"
4206,ARGUMENT,"Of all the Gods, and at the hour of rest."
4207,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, toil-worn Hero, through the house"
4208,ARGUMENT,"Pass'd undelaying, by Minerva thick"
4209,ARGUMENT,"With darkness circumfus'd, till he arrived"
4210,ARGUMENT,Where King Alcinoüs and Areta sat.
4211,ARGUMENT,"Around Areta's knees his arms he cast,"
4212,ARGUMENT,"And, in that moment, broken clear away"
4213,ARGUMENT,"The cloud all went, shed on him from above."
4214,ARGUMENT,"Dumb sat the guests, seeing the unknown Chief,"
4215,ARGUMENT,And wond'ring gazed. He thus his suit preferr'd.                 180
4216,ARGUMENT,"Areta, daughter of the Godlike Prince"
4217,ARGUMENT,"Rhexenor! suppliant at thy knees I fall,"
4218,ARGUMENT,"Thy royal spouse imploring, and thyself,"
4219,ARGUMENT,"(After ten thousand toils) and these your guests,"
4220,ARGUMENT,"To whom heav'n grant felicity, and to leave"
4221,ARGUMENT,"Their treasures to their babes, with all the rights"
4222,ARGUMENT,"And honours, by the people's suffrage, theirs!"
4223,ARGUMENT,"But oh vouchsafe me, who have wanted long"
4224,ARGUMENT,"And ardent wish'd my home, without delay"
4225,ARGUMENT,Safe conduct to my native shores again!                          190
4226,ARGUMENT,"Such suit he made, and in the ashes sat"
4227,ARGUMENT,"At the hearth-side; they mute long time remain'd,"
4228,ARGUMENT,"Till, at the last, the antient Hero spake"
4229,ARGUMENT,"Echeneus, eldest of Phæacia's sons,"
4230,ARGUMENT,"With eloquence beyond the rest endow'd,"
4231,ARGUMENT,"Rich in traditionary lore, and wise"
4232,ARGUMENT,"In all, who thus, benevolent, began."
4233,ARGUMENT,"Not honourable to thyself, O King!"
4234,ARGUMENT,"Is such a sight, a stranger on the ground"
4235,ARGUMENT,"At the hearth-side seated, and in the dust.                      200"
4236,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, thy guests, expecting thy command,"
4237,ARGUMENT,Move not; thou therefore raising by his hand
4238,ARGUMENT,"The stranger, lead him to a throne, and bid"
4239,ARGUMENT,"The heralds mingle wine, that we may pour"
4240,ARGUMENT,"To thunder-bearing Jove, the suppliant's friend."
4241,ARGUMENT,Then let the cat'ress for thy guest produce
4242,ARGUMENT,"Supply, a supper from the last regale."
4243,ARGUMENT,"Soon as those words Alcinoüs heard, the King,"
4244,ARGUMENT,Upraising by his hand the prudent Chief
4245,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses from the hearth, he made him sit,                        210"
4246,ARGUMENT,"On a bright throne, displacing for his sake"
4247,ARGUMENT,"Laodamas his son, the virtuous youth"
4248,ARGUMENT,"Who sat beside him, and whom most he lov'd."
4249,ARGUMENT,"And now, a maiden charg'd with golden ew'r"
4250,ARGUMENT,"And with an argent laver, pouring, first,"
4251,ARGUMENT,"Pure water on his hands, supply'd him, next,"
4252,ARGUMENT,"With a resplendent table, which the chaste"
4253,ARGUMENT,Directress of the stores furnish'd with bread
4254,ARGUMENT,"And dainties, remnants of the last regale."
4255,ARGUMENT,"Then ate the Hero toil-inured, and drank,                        220"
4256,ARGUMENT,And to his herald thus Alcinoüs spake.
4257,ARGUMENT,"Pontonoüs! mingling wine, bear it around"
4258,ARGUMENT,"To ev'ry guest in turn, that we may pour"
4259,ARGUMENT,"To thunder-bearer Jove, the stranger's friend,"
4260,ARGUMENT,And guardian of the suppliant's sacred rights.
4261,ARGUMENT,"He said; Pontonoüs, as he bade, the wine"
4262,ARGUMENT,"Mingled delicious, and the cups dispensed"
4263,ARGUMENT,With distribution regular to all.
4264,ARGUMENT,"When each had made libation, and had drunk"
4265,ARGUMENT,"Sufficient, then, Alcinoüs thus began.                           230"
4266,ARGUMENT,"Phæacian Chiefs and Senators, I speak"
4267,ARGUMENT,"The dictates of my mind, therefore attend!"
4268,ARGUMENT,Ye all have feasted--To your homes and sleep.
4269,ARGUMENT,We will assemble at the dawn of day
4270,ARGUMENT,"More senior Chiefs, that we may entertain"
4271,ARGUMENT,"The stranger here, and to the Gods perform"
4272,ARGUMENT,Due sacrifice; the convoy that he asks
4273,ARGUMENT,"Shall next engage our thoughts, that free from pain"
4274,ARGUMENT,"And from vexation, by our friendly aid"
4275,ARGUMENT,"He may revisit, joyful and with speed,                           240"
4276,ARGUMENT,"His native shore, however far remote."
4277,ARGUMENT,"No inconvenience let him feel or harm,"
4278,ARGUMENT,"Ere his arrival; but, arrived, thenceforth"
4279,ARGUMENT,He must endure whatever lot the Fates
4280,ARGUMENT,Spun for him in the moment of his birth.
4281,ARGUMENT,But should he prove some Deity from heav'n
4282,ARGUMENT,"Descended, then the Immortals have in view"
4283,ARGUMENT,Designs not yet apparent; for the Gods
4284,ARGUMENT,Have ever from of old reveal'd themselves
4285,ARGUMENT,"At our solemnities, have on our seats                            250"
4286,ARGUMENT,"Sat with us evident, and shared the feast;"
4287,ARGUMENT,And even if a single traveller
4288,ARGUMENT,"Of the Phæacians meet them, all reserve"
4289,ARGUMENT,They lay aside; for with the Gods we boast
4290,ARGUMENT,As near affinity as do themselves
4291,ARGUMENT,"The Cyclops, or the Giant race profane.[26]"
4292,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
4293,ARGUMENT,Alcinoüs! think not so. Resemblance none
4294,ARGUMENT,In figure or in lineaments I bear
4295,ARGUMENT,"To the immortal tenants of the skies,                            260"
4296,ARGUMENT,But to the sons of earth; if ye have known
4297,ARGUMENT,A man afflicted with a weight of woe
4298,ARGUMENT,"Peculiar, let me be with him compared;"
4299,ARGUMENT,"Woes even passing his could I relate,"
4300,ARGUMENT,And all inflicted on me by the Gods.
4301,ARGUMENT,"But let me eat, comfortless as I am,"
4302,ARGUMENT,Uninterrupted; for no call is loud
4303,ARGUMENT,As that of hunger in the ears of man;
4304,ARGUMENT,"Importunate, unreas'nable, it constrains"
4305,ARGUMENT,"His notice, more than all his woes beside.                       270"
4306,ARGUMENT,"So, I much sorrow feel, yet not the less"
4307,ARGUMENT,Hear I the blatant appetite demand
4308,ARGUMENT,"Due sustenance, and with a voice that drowns"
4309,ARGUMENT,"E'en all my suff'rings, till itself be fill'd."
4310,ARGUMENT,But expedite ye at the dawn of day
4311,ARGUMENT,"My safe return into my native land,"
4312,ARGUMENT,After much mis'ry; and let life itself
4313,ARGUMENT,"Forsake me, may I but once more behold"
4314,ARGUMENT,"All that is mine, in my own lofty abode."
4315,ARGUMENT,"He spake, whom all applauded, and advised,                     280"
4316,ARGUMENT,"Unanimous, the guest's conveyance home,"
4317,ARGUMENT,"Who had so fitly spoken. When, at length,"
4318,ARGUMENT,"All had libation made, and were sufficed,"
4319,ARGUMENT,"Departing to his house, each sought repose."
4320,ARGUMENT,"But still Ulysses in the hall remain'd,"
4321,ARGUMENT,"Where, godlike King, Alcinoüs at his side"
4322,ARGUMENT,"Sat, and Areta; the attendants clear'd"
4323,ARGUMENT,"Meantime the board, and thus the Queen white-arm'd,"
4324,ARGUMENT,"(Marking the vest and mantle, which he wore"
4325,ARGUMENT,And which her maidens and herself had made)                      290
4326,ARGUMENT,In accents wing'd with eager haste began.
4327,ARGUMENT,Stranger! the first enquiry shall be mine;
4328,ARGUMENT,"Who art, and whence? From whom receiv'dst thou these?"
4329,ARGUMENT,Saidst not--I came a wand'rer o'er the Deep?
4330,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
4331,ARGUMENT,Oh Queen! the task were difficult to unfold
4332,ARGUMENT,"In all its length the story of my woes,"
4333,ARGUMENT,For I have num'rous from the Gods receiv'd;
4334,ARGUMENT,But I will answer thee as best I may.
4335,ARGUMENT,"There is a certain isle, Ogygia, placed                          300"
4336,ARGUMENT,"Far distant in the Deep; there dwells, by man"
4337,ARGUMENT,"Alike unvisited, and by the Gods,"
4338,ARGUMENT,"Calypso, beauteous nymph, but deeply skill'd"
4339,ARGUMENT,"In artifice, and terrible in pow'r,"
4340,ARGUMENT,Daughter of Atlas. Me alone my fate
4341,ARGUMENT,"Her miserable inmate made, when Jove"
4342,ARGUMENT,Had riv'n asunder with his candent bolt
4343,ARGUMENT,My bark in the mid-sea. There perish'd all
4344,ARGUMENT,"The valiant partners of my toils, and I"
4345,ARGUMENT,My vessel's keel embracing day and night                         310
4346,ARGUMENT,"With folded arms, nine days was borne along."
4347,ARGUMENT,"But on the tenth dark night, as pleas'd the Gods,"
4348,ARGUMENT,"They drove me to Ogygia, where resides"
4349,ARGUMENT,"Calypso, beauteous nymph, dreadful in pow'r;"
4350,ARGUMENT,"She rescued, cherish'd, fed me, and her wish"
4351,ARGUMENT,"Was to confer on me immortal life,"
4352,ARGUMENT,Exempt for ever from the sap of age.
4353,ARGUMENT,But me her offer'd boon sway'd not. Sev'n years
4354,ARGUMENT,"I there abode continual, with my tears"
4355,ARGUMENT,"Bedewing ceaseless my ambrosial robes,                           320"
4356,ARGUMENT,"Calypso's gift divine; but when, at length,"
4357,ARGUMENT,"(Sev'n years elaps'd) the circling eighth arrived,"
4358,ARGUMENT,"She then, herself, my quick departure thence"
4359,ARGUMENT,"Advised, by Jove's own mandate overaw'd,"
4360,ARGUMENT,Which even her had influenced to a change.
4361,ARGUMENT,On a well-corded raft she sent me forth
4362,ARGUMENT,With num'rous presents; bread she put and wine
4363,ARGUMENT,"On board, and cloath'd me in immortal robes;"
4364,ARGUMENT,She sent before me also a fair wind
4365,ARGUMENT,"Fresh-blowing, but not dang'rous. Sev'nteen days                 330"
4366,ARGUMENT,"I sail'd the flood continual, and descried,"
4367,ARGUMENT,"On the eighteenth, your shadowy mountains tall"
4368,ARGUMENT,"When my exulting heart sprang at the sight,"
4369,ARGUMENT,"All wretched as I was, and still ordain'd"
4370,ARGUMENT,To strive with difficulties many and hard
4371,ARGUMENT,From adverse Neptune; he the stormy winds
4372,ARGUMENT,"Exciting opposite, my wat'ry way"
4373,ARGUMENT,"Impeded, and the waves heav'd to a bulk"
4374,ARGUMENT,"Immeasurable, such as robb'd me soon"
4375,ARGUMENT,"Deep-groaning, of the raft, my only hope;                        340"
4376,ARGUMENT,"For her the tempest scatter'd, and myself"
4377,ARGUMENT,"This ocean measur'd swimming, till the winds"
4378,ARGUMENT,And mighty waters cast me on your shore.
4379,ARGUMENT,"Me there emerging, the huge waves had dash'd"
4380,ARGUMENT,"Full on the land, where, incommodious most,"
4381,ARGUMENT,"The shore presented only roughest rocks,"
4382,ARGUMENT,"But, leaving it, I swam the Deep again,"
4383,ARGUMENT,"Till now, at last, a river's gentle stream"
4384,ARGUMENT,"Receiv'd me, by no rocks deform'd, and where"
4385,ARGUMENT,No violent winds the shelter'd bank annoy'd.                     350
4386,ARGUMENT,"I flung myself on shore, exhausted, weak,"
4387,ARGUMENT,"Needing repose; ambrosial night came on,"
4388,ARGUMENT,"When from the Jove-descended stream withdrawn,"
4389,ARGUMENT,I in a thicket lay'd me down on leaves
4390,ARGUMENT,"Which I had heap'd together, and the Gods"
4391,ARGUMENT,O'erwhelm'd my eye-lids with a flood of sleep.
4392,ARGUMENT,"There under wither'd leaves, forlorn, I slept"
4393,ARGUMENT,"All the long night, the morning and the noon,"
4394,ARGUMENT,"But balmy sleep, at the decline of day,"
4395,ARGUMENT,"Broke from me; then, your daughter's train I heard               360"
4396,ARGUMENT,"Sporting, with whom she also sported, fair"
4397,ARGUMENT,And graceful as the Gods. To her I kneel'd.
4398,ARGUMENT,"She, following the dictates of a mind"
4399,ARGUMENT,"Ingenuous, pass'd in her behaviour all"
4400,ARGUMENT,Which even ye could from an age like hers
4401,ARGUMENT,Have hoped; for youth is ever indiscrete.
4402,ARGUMENT,"She gave me plenteous food, with richest wine"
4403,ARGUMENT,"Refresh'd my spirit, taught me where to bathe,"
4404,ARGUMENT,"And cloath'd me as thou seest; thus, though a prey"
4405,ARGUMENT,"To many sorrows, I have told thee truth.                         370"
4406,ARGUMENT,To whom Alcinoüs answer thus return'd.
4407,ARGUMENT,"My daughter's conduct, I perceive, hath been"
4408,ARGUMENT,"In this erroneous, that she led thee not"
4409,ARGUMENT,"Hither, at once, with her attendant train,"
4410,ARGUMENT,For thy first suit was to herself alone.
4411,ARGUMENT,"Thus then Ulysses, wary Chief, replied."
4412,ARGUMENT,"Blame not, O Hero, for so slight a cause"
4413,ARGUMENT,"Thy faultless child; she bade me follow them,"
4414,ARGUMENT,"But I refused, by fear and awe restrain'd,"
4415,ARGUMENT,Lest thou should'st feel displeasure at that sight               380
4416,ARGUMENT,"Thyself; for we are all, in ev'ry clime,"
4417,ARGUMENT,"Suspicious, and to worst constructions prone."
4418,ARGUMENT,"So spake Ulysses, to whom thus the King."
4419,ARGUMENT,"I bear not, stranger! in my breast an heart"
4420,ARGUMENT,Causeless irascible; for at all times
4421,ARGUMENT,A temp'rate equanimity is best.
4422,ARGUMENT,"And oh, I would to heav'n, that, being such"
4423,ARGUMENT,"As now thou art, and of one mind with me,"
4424,ARGUMENT,"Thou would'st accept my daughter, would'st become"
4425,ARGUMENT,"My son-in-law, and dwell contented here!                         390"
4426,ARGUMENT,"House would I give thee, and possessions too,"
4427,ARGUMENT,"Were such thy choice; else, if thou chuse it not,"
4428,ARGUMENT,No man in all Phæacia shall by force
4429,ARGUMENT,Detain thee. Jupiter himself forbid!
4430,ARGUMENT,"For proof, I will appoint thee convoy hence"
4431,ARGUMENT,To-morrow; and while thou by sleep subdued
4432,ARGUMENT,"Shalt on thy bed repose, they with their oars"
4433,ARGUMENT,"Shall brush the placid flood, till thou arrive"
4434,ARGUMENT,"At home, or at what place soe'er thou would'st,"
4435,ARGUMENT,"Though far more distant than Eubœa lies,                         400"
4436,ARGUMENT,"Remotest isle from us, by the report"
4437,ARGUMENT,"Of ours, who saw it when they thither bore"
4438,ARGUMENT,"Golden-hair'd Rhadamanthus o'er the Deep,"
4439,ARGUMENT,To visit earth-born Tityus. To that isle
4440,ARGUMENT,"They went; they reach'd it, and they brought him thence"
4441,ARGUMENT,"Back to Phæacia, in one day, with ease."
4442,ARGUMENT,Thou also shalt be taught what ships I boast
4443,ARGUMENT,"Unmatch'd in swiftness, and how far my crews"
4444,ARGUMENT,"Excel, upturning with their oars the brine."
4445,ARGUMENT,He ceas'd; Ulysses toil-inur'd his words                       410
4446,ARGUMENT,"Exulting heard, and, praying, thus replied."
4447,ARGUMENT,Eternal Father! may the King perform
4448,ARGUMENT,His whole kind promise! grant him in all lands
4449,ARGUMENT,"A never-dying name, and grant to me"
4450,ARGUMENT,To visit safe my native shores again!
4451,ARGUMENT,Thus they conferr'd; and now Areta bade
4452,ARGUMENT,Her fair attendants dress a fleecy couch
4453,ARGUMENT,"Under the portico, with purple rugs"
4454,ARGUMENT,"Resplendent, and with arras spread beneath,"
4455,ARGUMENT,And over all with cloaks of shaggy pile.                         420
4456,ARGUMENT,"Forth went the maidens, bearing each a torch,"
4457,ARGUMENT,"And, as she bade, prepared in haste a couch"
4458,ARGUMENT,"Of depth commodious, then, returning, gave"
4459,ARGUMENT,Ulysses welcome summons to repose.
4460,ARGUMENT,Stranger! thy couch is spread. Hence to thy rest.
4461,ARGUMENT,So they--Thrice grateful to his soul the thought
4462,ARGUMENT,"Seem'd of repose. There slept Ulysses, then,"
4463,ARGUMENT,"On his carv'd couch, beneath the portico,"
4464,ARGUMENT,But in the inner-house Alcinoüs found
4465,ARGUMENT,"His place of rest, and hers with royal state                     430"
4466,ARGUMENT,"Prepared, the Queen his consort, at his side."

4490,ARGUMENT,
4491,ARGUMENT,The Phæacians consult on the subject of Ulysses. Preparation is made for
4492,ARGUMENT,his departure. Antinoüs entertains them at his table. Games follow the
4493,ARGUMENT,"entertainment. Demodocus the bard sings, first the loves of Mars and"
4494,ARGUMENT,"Venus, then the introduction of the wooden horse into Troy. Ulysses, much"
4495,ARGUMENT,"affected by his song, is questioned by Alcinoüs, whence, and who he is,"
4496,ARGUMENT,and what is the cause of his sorrow.
4497,ARGUMENT,
4498,ARGUMENT,
4499,ARGUMENT,"But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,"
4500,ARGUMENT,"Blush'd in the East, then from his bed arose"
4501,ARGUMENT,The sacred might of the Phæacian King.
4502,ARGUMENT,"Then uprose also, city-waster Chief,"
4503,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, whom the King Alcinoüs"
4504,ARGUMENT,Led forth to council at the ships convened.
4505,ARGUMENT,"There, side by side, on polish'd stones they sat"
4506,ARGUMENT,"Frequent; meantime, Minerva in the form"
4507,ARGUMENT,"Of King Alcinoüs' herald ranged the town,"
4508,ARGUMENT,With purpose to accelerate the return                             10
4509,ARGUMENT,"Of brave Ulysses to his native home,"
4510,ARGUMENT,And thus to ev'ry Chief the Goddess spake.
4511,ARGUMENT,"Phæacian Chiefs and Senators, away!"
4512,ARGUMENT,"Haste all to council on the stranger held,"
4513,ARGUMENT,Who hath of late beneath Alcinoüs' roof
4514,ARGUMENT,"Our King arrived, a wand'rer o'er the Deep,"
4515,ARGUMENT,"But, in his form, majestic as a God."
4516,ARGUMENT,"So saying, she roused the people, and at once"
4517,ARGUMENT,The seats of all the senate-court were fill'd
4518,ARGUMENT,"With fast-assembling throngs, no few of whom                      20"
4519,ARGUMENT,Had mark'd Ulysses with admiring eyes.
4520,ARGUMENT,"Then, Pallas o'er his head and shoulders broad"
4521,ARGUMENT,"Diffusing grace celestial, his whole form"
4522,ARGUMENT,"Dilated, and to the statelier height advanced,"
4523,ARGUMENT,That worthier of all rev'rence he might seem
4524,ARGUMENT,"To the Phæacians, and might many a feat"
4525,ARGUMENT,"Atchieve, with which they should assay his force."
4526,ARGUMENT,"When, therefore, the assembly now was full,"
4527,ARGUMENT,"Alcinoüs, them addressing, thus began."
4528,ARGUMENT,Phæacian Chiefs and Senators! I speak                           30
4529,ARGUMENT,"The dictates of my mind, therefore attend."
4530,ARGUMENT,"This guest, unknown to me, hath, wand'ring, found"
4531,ARGUMENT,"My palace, either from the East arrived,"
4532,ARGUMENT,Or from some nation on our western side.
4533,ARGUMENT,"Safe conduct home he asks, and our consent"
4534,ARGUMENT,"Here wishes ratified, whose quick return"
4535,ARGUMENT,"Be it our part, as usual, to promote;"
4536,ARGUMENT,"For at no time the stranger, from what coast"
4537,ARGUMENT,"Soe'er, who hath resorted to our doors,"
4538,ARGUMENT,Hath long complain'd of his detention here.                       40
4539,ARGUMENT,Haste--draw ye down into the sacred Deep
4540,ARGUMENT,"A vessel of prime speed, and, from among"
4541,ARGUMENT,"The people, fifty and two youths select,"
4542,ARGUMENT,"Approved the best; then, lashing fast the oars,"
4543,ARGUMENT,"Leave her, that at my palace ye may make"
4544,ARGUMENT,"Short feast, for which myself will all provide."
4545,ARGUMENT,Thus I enjoin the crew; but as for those
4546,ARGUMENT,"Of sceptred rank, I bid them all alike"
4547,ARGUMENT,"To my own board, that here we may regale"
4548,ARGUMENT,"The stranger nobly, and let none refuse.                          50"
4549,ARGUMENT,"Call, too, Demodocus, the bard divine,"
4550,ARGUMENT,"To share my banquet, whom the Gods have blest"
4551,ARGUMENT,"With pow'rs of song delectable, unmatch'd"
4552,ARGUMENT,"By any, when his genius once is fired."
4553,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd, and led the way, whom follow'd all"
4554,ARGUMENT,"The sceptred senators, while to the house"
4555,ARGUMENT,An herald hasted of the bard divine.
4556,ARGUMENT,"Then, fifty mariners and two, from all"
4557,ARGUMENT,"The rest selected, to the coast repair'd,"
4558,ARGUMENT,"And, from her station on the sea-bank, launched                   60"
4559,ARGUMENT,The galley down into the sacred Deep.
4560,ARGUMENT,"They placed the canvas and the mast on board,"
4561,ARGUMENT,"Arranged the oars, unfurl'd the shining sail,"
4562,ARGUMENT,"And, leaving her in depth of water moor'd,"
4563,ARGUMENT,All sought the palace of Alcinoüs.
4564,ARGUMENT,"There, soon, the portico, the court, the hall"
4565,ARGUMENT,"Were fill'd with multitudes of young and old,"
4566,ARGUMENT,For whose regale the mighty monarch slew
4567,ARGUMENT,"Two beeves, twelve sheep, and twice four fatted brawns."
4568,ARGUMENT,"They slay'd them first, then busily their task                    70"
4569,ARGUMENT,"Administ'ring, prepared the joyous feast."
4570,ARGUMENT,"And now the herald came, leading with care"
4571,ARGUMENT,"The tuneful bard; dear to the muse was he,"
4572,ARGUMENT,Who yet appointed him both good and ill;
4573,ARGUMENT,"Took from him sight, but gave him strains divine."
4574,ARGUMENT,"For him, Pontonoüs in the midst disposed"
4575,ARGUMENT,"An argent-studded throne, thrusting it close"
4576,ARGUMENT,"To a tall column, where he hung his lyre"
4577,ARGUMENT,"Above his head, and taught him where it hung."
4578,ARGUMENT,"He set before him, next, a polish'd board                         80"
4579,ARGUMENT,"And basket, and a goblet fill'd with wine"
4580,ARGUMENT,"For his own use, and at his own command."
4581,ARGUMENT,"Then, all assail'd at once the ready feast,"
4582,ARGUMENT,"And when nor hunger more nor thirst they felt,"
4583,ARGUMENT,"Then came the muse, and roused the bard to sing"
4584,ARGUMENT,"Exploits of men renown'd; it was a song,"
4585,ARGUMENT,"In that day, to the highest heav'n extoll'd."
4586,ARGUMENT,He sang of a dispute kindled between
4587,ARGUMENT,"The son of Peleus, and Laertes'[27] son,"
4588,ARGUMENT,Both seated at a feast held to the Gods.                          90
4589,ARGUMENT,"That contest Agamemnon, King of men,"
4590,ARGUMENT,Between the noblest of Achaia's host
4591,ARGUMENT,"Hearing, rejoiced; for when in Pytho erst"
4592,ARGUMENT,He pass'd the marble threshold to consult
4593,ARGUMENT,"The oracle of Apollo, such dispute"
4594,ARGUMENT,The voice divine had to his ear announced;
4595,ARGUMENT,"For then it was that, first, the storm of war"
4596,ARGUMENT,"Came rolling on, ordain'd long time to afflict"
4597,ARGUMENT,"Troy and the Greecians, by the will of Jove."
4598,ARGUMENT,So sang the bard illustrious; then his robe                    100
4599,ARGUMENT,Of purple dye with both hands o'er his head
4600,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses drew, behind its ample folds"
4601,ARGUMENT,"Veiling his face, through fear to be observed"
4602,ARGUMENT,By the Phæacians weeping at the song;
4603,ARGUMENT,"And ever as the bard harmonious ceased,"
4604,ARGUMENT,"He wiped his tears, and, drawing from his brows"
4605,ARGUMENT,"The mantle, pour'd libation to the Gods."
4606,ARGUMENT,But when the Chiefs (for they delighted heard
4607,ARGUMENT,"Those sounds) solicited again the bard,"
4608,ARGUMENT,"And he renew'd the strain, then cov'ring close                   110"
4609,ARGUMENT,"His count'nance, as before, Ulysses wept."
4610,ARGUMENT,"Thus, unperceiv'd by all, the Hero mourn'd,"
4611,ARGUMENT,"Save by Alcinoüs; he alone his tears,"
4612,ARGUMENT,"(Beside him seated) mark'd, and his deep sighs"
4613,ARGUMENT,"O'erhearing, the Phæacians thus bespake."
4614,ARGUMENT,"Phæacia's Chiefs and Senators, attend!"
4615,ARGUMENT,"We have regaled sufficient, and the harp"
4616,ARGUMENT,"Heard to satiety, companion sweet"
4617,ARGUMENT,And seasonable of the festive hour.
4618,ARGUMENT,Now go we forth for honourable proof                             120
4619,ARGUMENT,"Of our address in games of ev'ry kind,"
4620,ARGUMENT,"That this our guest may to his friends report,"
4621,ARGUMENT,"At home arriv'd, that none like us have learn'd"
4622,ARGUMENT,"To leap, to box, to wrestle, and to run."
4623,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he led them forth, whose steps the guests"
4624,ARGUMENT,"All follow'd, and the herald hanging high"
4625,ARGUMENT,"The sprightly lyre, took by his hand the bard"
4626,ARGUMENT,"Demodocus, whom he the self-same way"
4627,ARGUMENT,"Conducted forth, by which the Chiefs had gone"
4628,ARGUMENT,"Themselves, for that great spectacle prepared.                   130"
4629,ARGUMENT,They sought the forum; countless swarm'd the throng
4630,ARGUMENT,"Behind them as they went, and many a youth"
4631,ARGUMENT,Strong and courageous to the strife arose.
4632,ARGUMENT,"Upstood Acroneus and Ocyalus,"
4633,ARGUMENT,"Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, after whom"
4634,ARGUMENT,Anchialus with Anabeesineus
4635,ARGUMENT,"Arose, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus bold,"
4636,ARGUMENT,"Amphialus and Thöon. Then arose,"
4637,ARGUMENT,"In aspect dread as homicidal Mars,"
4638,ARGUMENT,"Euryalus, and for his graceful form                              140"
4639,ARGUMENT,(After Laodamas) distinguish'd most
4640,ARGUMENT,"Of all Phæacia's sons, Naubolides."
4641,ARGUMENT,"Three also from Alcinoüs sprung, arose,"
4642,ARGUMENT,"Laodamas, his eldest; Halius, next,"
4643,ARGUMENT,His second-born; and godlike Clytoneus.
4644,ARGUMENT,"Of these, some started for the runner's prize."
4645,ARGUMENT,They gave the race its limits.[28] All at once
4646,ARGUMENT,Along the dusty champaign swift they flew.
4647,ARGUMENT,"But Clytoneus, illustrious youth, outstripp'd"
4648,ARGUMENT,All competition; far as mules surpass                            150
4649,ARGUMENT,"Slow oxen furrowing the fallow ground,"
4650,ARGUMENT,So far before all others he arrived
4651,ARGUMENT,"Victorious, where the throng'd spectators stood."
4652,ARGUMENT,"Some tried the wrestler's toil severe, in which"
4653,ARGUMENT,Euryalus superior proved to all.
4654,ARGUMENT,In the long leap Amphialus prevail'd;
4655,ARGUMENT,"Elatreus most successful hurled the quoit,"
4656,ARGUMENT,"And at the cestus,[29] last, the noble son"
4657,ARGUMENT,"Of Scheria's King, Laodamas excell'd."
4658,ARGUMENT,When thus with contemplation of the games                        160
4659,ARGUMENT,"All had been gratified, Alcinoüs' son"
4660,ARGUMENT,"Laodamas, arising, then address'd."
4661,ARGUMENT,"Friends! ask we now the stranger, if he boast"
4662,ARGUMENT,Proficiency in aught. His figure seems
4663,ARGUMENT,"Not ill; in thighs, and legs, and arms he shews"
4664,ARGUMENT,"Much strength, and in his brawny neck; nor youth"
4665,ARGUMENT,"Hath left him yet, though batter'd he appears"
4666,ARGUMENT,"With num'rous troubles, and misfortune-flaw'd."
4667,ARGUMENT,Nor know I hardships in the world so sure
4668,ARGUMENT,"To break the strongest down, as those by sea.                    170"
4669,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus Euryalus return'd.
4670,ARGUMENT,"Thou hast well said, Laodamas; thyself"
4671,ARGUMENT,"Approaching, speak to him, and call him forth."
4672,ARGUMENT,"Which when Alcinoüs' noble offspring heard,"
4673,ARGUMENT,"Advancing from his seat, amid them all"
4674,ARGUMENT,"He stood, and to Ulysses thus began."
4675,ARGUMENT,"Stand forth, oh guest, thou also; prove thy skill"
4676,ARGUMENT,"(If any such thou hast) in games like ours,"
4677,ARGUMENT,"Which, likeliest, thou hast learn'd; for greater praise"
4678,ARGUMENT,"Hath no man, while he lives, than that he know                   180"
4679,ARGUMENT,His feet to exercise and hands aright.
4680,ARGUMENT,"Come then; make trial; scatter wide thy cares,"
4681,ARGUMENT,We will not hold thee long; the ship is launch'd
4682,ARGUMENT,"Already, and the crew stand all prepared."
4683,ARGUMENT,To whom replied the wily Chief renown'd
4684,ARGUMENT,"Wherefore, as in derision, have ye call'd"
4685,ARGUMENT,"Me forth, Laodamas, to these exploits?"
4686,ARGUMENT,"No games have I, but many a grief, at heart,"
4687,ARGUMENT,"And with far other struggles worn, here sit"
4688,ARGUMENT,"Desirous only of conveyance home,                                190"
4689,ARGUMENT,For which both King and people I implore.
4690,ARGUMENT,Then him Euryalus aloud reproach'd.
4691,ARGUMENT,"I well believ'd it, friend! in thee the guise"
4692,ARGUMENT,I see not of a man expert in feats
4693,ARGUMENT,"Athletic, of which various are perform'd"
4694,ARGUMENT,In ev'ry land; thou rather seem'st with ships
4695,ARGUMENT,"Familiar; one, accustom'd to controul"
4696,ARGUMENT,Some crew of trading mariners; well-learn'd
4697,ARGUMENT,"In stowage, pilotage, and wealth acquired"
4698,ARGUMENT,"By rapine, but of no gymnastic pow'rs.                           200"
4699,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, frowning dark, replied."
4700,ARGUMENT,"Thou hast ill spoken, sir, and like a man"
4701,ARGUMENT,Regardless whom he wrongs. Therefore the Gods
4702,ARGUMENT,"Give not endowments graceful in each kind,"
4703,ARGUMENT,"Of body, mind, and utt'rance, all to one."
4704,ARGUMENT,"This man in figure less excels, yet Jove"
4705,ARGUMENT,Crowns him with eloquence; his hearers charm'd
4706,ARGUMENT,"Behold him, while with modest confidence"
4707,ARGUMENT,"He bears the prize of fluent speech from all,"
4708,ARGUMENT,And in the streets is gazed on as a God!                         210
4709,ARGUMENT,"Another, in his form the Pow'rs above"
4710,ARGUMENT,"Resembles, but no grace around his words"
4711,ARGUMENT,"Twines itself elegant. So, thou in form"
4712,ARGUMENT,"Hast excellence to boast; a God, employ'd"
4713,ARGUMENT,"To make a master-piece in human shape,"
4714,ARGUMENT,Could but produce proportions such as thine;
4715,ARGUMENT,Yet hast thou an untutor'd intellect.
4716,ARGUMENT,Thou much hast moved me; thy unhandsome phrase
4717,ARGUMENT,"Hath roused my wrath; I am not, as thou say'st,"
4718,ARGUMENT,"A novice in these sports, but took the lead                      220"
4719,ARGUMENT,"In all, while youth and strength were on my side."
4720,ARGUMENT,"But I am now in bands of sorrow held,"
4721,ARGUMENT,"And of misfortune, having much endured"
4722,ARGUMENT,"In war, and buffeting the boist'rous waves."
4723,ARGUMENT,"Yet, though with mis'ry worn, I will essay"
4724,ARGUMENT,My strength among you; for thy words had teeth
4725,ARGUMENT,Whose bite hath pinch'd and pain'd me to the proof.
4726,ARGUMENT,"He said; and mantled as he was, a quoit"
4727,ARGUMENT,"Upstarting, seized, in bulk and weight all those"
4728,ARGUMENT,"Transcending far, by the Phæacians used.                         230"
4729,ARGUMENT,"Swiftly he swung, and from his vig'rous hand"
4730,ARGUMENT,"Sent it. Loud sang the stone, and as it flew"
4731,ARGUMENT,The maritime Phæacians low inclined
4732,ARGUMENT,"Their heads beneath it; over all the marks,"
4733,ARGUMENT,"And far beyond them, sped the flying rock."
4734,ARGUMENT,"Minerva, in a human form, the cast"
4735,ARGUMENT,"Prodigious measur'd, and aloud exclaim'd."
4736,ARGUMENT,Stranger! the blind himself might with his hands
4737,ARGUMENT,Feel out the 'vantage here. Thy quoit disdains
4738,ARGUMENT,"Fellowship with a crowd, borne far beyond.                       240"
4739,ARGUMENT,Fear not a losing game; Phæacian none
4740,ARGUMENT,"Will reach thy measure, much less overcast."
4741,ARGUMENT,"She ceased; Ulysses, hardy Chief, rejoiced"
4742,ARGUMENT,That in the circus he had found a judge
4743,ARGUMENT,"So favorable, and with brisker tone,"
4744,ARGUMENT,"As less in wrath, the multitude address'd."
4745,ARGUMENT,"Young men, reach this, and I will quickly heave"
4746,ARGUMENT,"Another such, or yet a heavier quoit."
4747,ARGUMENT,"Then, come the man whose courage prompts him forth"
4748,ARGUMENT,"To box, to wrestle with me, or to run;                           250"
4749,ARGUMENT,"For ye have chafed me much, and I decline"
4750,ARGUMENT,"No strife with any here, but challenge all"
4751,ARGUMENT,"Phæacia, save Laodamas alone."
4752,ARGUMENT,He is mine host. Who combats with his friend?
4753,ARGUMENT,To call to proof of hardiment the man
4754,ARGUMENT,"Who entertains him in a foreign land,"
4755,ARGUMENT,"Would but evince the challenger a fool,"
4756,ARGUMENT,"Who, so, would cripple his own interest there."
4757,ARGUMENT,"As for the rest, I none refuse, scorn none,"
4758,ARGUMENT,"But wish for trial of you, and to match                          260"
4759,ARGUMENT,In opposition fair my force with yours.
4760,ARGUMENT,There is no game athletic in the use
4761,ARGUMENT,"Of all mankind, too difficult for me;"
4762,ARGUMENT,"I handle well the polish'd bow, and first"
4763,ARGUMENT,"Amid a thousand foes strike whom I mark,"
4764,ARGUMENT,Although a throng of warriors at my side
4765,ARGUMENT,"Imbattled, speed their shafts at the same time."
4766,ARGUMENT,Of all Achaia's sons who erst at Troy
4767,ARGUMENT,"Drew bow, the sole who bore the prize from me"
4768,ARGUMENT,Was Philoctetes; I resign it else                                270
4769,ARGUMENT,To none now nourish'd with the fruits of earth.
4770,ARGUMENT,Yet mean I no comparison of myself
4771,ARGUMENT,"With men of antient times, with Hercules,"
4772,ARGUMENT,"Or with Oechalian Eurytus, who, both,"
4773,ARGUMENT,The Gods themselves in archery defied.
4774,ARGUMENT,"Soon, therefore, died huge Eurytus, ere yet"
4775,ARGUMENT,"Old age he reach'd; him, angry to be call'd"
4776,ARGUMENT,"To proof of archership, Apollo slew."
4777,ARGUMENT,"But if ye name the spear, mine flies a length"
4778,ARGUMENT,By no man's arrow reach'd; I fear no foil                        280
4779,ARGUMENT,"From the Phæacians, save in speed alone;"
4780,ARGUMENT,"For I have suffer'd hardships, dash'd and drench'd"
4781,ARGUMENT,"By many a wave, nor had I food on board"
4782,ARGUMENT,"At all times, therefore I am much unstrung."
4783,ARGUMENT,"He spake; and silent the Phæacians sat,"
4784,ARGUMENT,Of whom alone Alcinoüs thus replied.
4785,ARGUMENT,"Since, stranger, not ungraceful is thy speech,"
4786,ARGUMENT,Who hast but vindicated in our ears
4787,ARGUMENT,"Thy question'd prowess, angry that this youth"
4788,ARGUMENT,"Reproach'd thee in the presence of us all,                       290"
4789,ARGUMENT,That no man qualified to give his voice
4790,ARGUMENT,"In public, might affront thy courage more;"
4791,ARGUMENT,"Now mark me, therefore, that in time to come,"
4792,ARGUMENT,"While feasting with thy children and thy spouse,"
4793,ARGUMENT,Thou may'st inform the Heroes of thy land
4794,ARGUMENT,Even of our proficiency in arts
4795,ARGUMENT,By Jove enjoin'd us in our father's days.
4796,ARGUMENT,"We boast not much the boxer's skill, nor yet"
4797,ARGUMENT,The wrestler's; but light-footed in the race
4798,ARGUMENT,"Are we, and navigators well-inform'd.                            300"
4799,ARGUMENT,"Our pleasures are the feast, the harp, the dance,"
4800,ARGUMENT,Garments for change; the tepid bath; the bed.
4801,ARGUMENT,"Come, ye Phæacians, beyond others skill'd"
4802,ARGUMENT,"To tread the circus with harmonious steps,"
4803,ARGUMENT,"Come, play before us; that our guest, arrived"
4804,ARGUMENT,"In his own country, may inform his friends"
4805,ARGUMENT,"How far in seamanship we all excel,"
4806,ARGUMENT,"In running, in the dance, and in the song."
4807,ARGUMENT,Haste! bring ye to Demodocus his lyre
4808,ARGUMENT,"Clear-toned, left somewhere in our hall at home.                 310"
4809,ARGUMENT,"So spake the godlike King, at whose command"
4810,ARGUMENT,The herald to the palace quick return'd
4811,ARGUMENT,To seek the charming lyre. Meantime arose
4812,ARGUMENT,"Nine arbiters, appointed to intend"
4813,ARGUMENT,"The whole arrangement of the public games,"
4814,ARGUMENT,"To smooth the circus floor, and give the ring"
4815,ARGUMENT,"Its compass, widening the attentive throng."
4816,ARGUMENT,"Ere long the herald came, bearing the harp,"
4817,ARGUMENT,"With which Demodocus supplied, advanced"
4818,ARGUMENT,"Into the middle area, around whom                                320"
4819,ARGUMENT,"Stood blooming youths, all skilful in the dance."
4820,ARGUMENT,With footsteps justly timed all smote at once
4821,ARGUMENT,"The sacred floor; Ulysses wonder-fixt,"
4822,ARGUMENT,The ceaseless play of twinkling[30] feet admired.
4823,ARGUMENT,"Then, tuning his sweet chords, Demodocus"
4824,ARGUMENT,"A jocund strain began, his theme, the loves"
4825,ARGUMENT,Of Mars and Cytherea chaplet-crown'd;
4826,ARGUMENT,"How first, clandestine, they embraced beneath"
4827,ARGUMENT,"The roof of Vulcan, her, by many a gift"
4828,ARGUMENT,"Seduced, Mars won, and with adult'rous lust                      330"
4829,ARGUMENT,The bed dishonour'd of the King of fire.
4830,ARGUMENT,"The sun, a witness of their amorous sport,"
4831,ARGUMENT,"Bore swift the tale to Vulcan; he, apprized"
4832,ARGUMENT,"Of that foul deed, at once his smithy sought,"
4833,ARGUMENT,In secret darkness of his inmost soul
4834,ARGUMENT,Contriving vengeance; to the stock he heav'd
4835,ARGUMENT,"His anvil huge, on which he forged a snare"
4836,ARGUMENT,"Of bands indissoluble, by no art"
4837,ARGUMENT,"To be untied, durance for ever firm."
4838,ARGUMENT,"The net prepared, he bore it, fiery-wroth,                       340"
4839,ARGUMENT,"To his own chamber and his nuptial couch,"
4840,ARGUMENT,"Where, stretching them from post to post, he wrapp'd"
4841,ARGUMENT,"With those fine meshes all his bed around,"
4842,ARGUMENT,"And hung them num'rous from the roof, diffused"
4843,ARGUMENT,"Like spiders' filaments, which not the Gods"
4844,ARGUMENT,"Themselves could see, so subtle were the toils."
4845,ARGUMENT,When thus he had encircled all his bed
4846,ARGUMENT,"On ev'ry side, he feign'd a journey thence"
4847,ARGUMENT,"To Lemnos, of all cities that adorn"
4848,ARGUMENT,"The earth, the city that he favours most.                        350"
4849,ARGUMENT,Nor kept the God of the resplendent reins
4850,ARGUMENT,"Mars, drowsy watch, but seeing that the famed"
4851,ARGUMENT,"Artificer of heav'n had left his home,"
4852,ARGUMENT,"Flew to the house of Vulcan, hot to enjoy"
4853,ARGUMENT,The Goddess with the wreath-encircled brows.
4854,ARGUMENT,"She, newly from her potent Sire return'd"
4855,ARGUMENT,"The son of Saturn, sat. Mars, ent'ring, seiz'd"
4856,ARGUMENT,"Her hand, hung on it, and thus urg'd his suit."
4857,ARGUMENT,"To bed, my fair, and let us love! for lo!"
4858,ARGUMENT,"Thine husband is from home, to Lemnos gone,                      360"
4859,ARGUMENT,"And to the Sintians, men of barb'rous speech."
4860,ARGUMENT,"He spake, nor she was loth, but bedward too"
4861,ARGUMENT,"Like him inclined; so then, to bed they went,"
4862,ARGUMENT,"And as they lay'd them down, down stream'd the net"
4863,ARGUMENT,"Around them, labour exquisite of hands"
4864,ARGUMENT,By ingenuity divine inform'd.
4865,ARGUMENT,"Small room they found, so prison'd; not a limb"
4866,ARGUMENT,"Could either lift, or move, but felt at once"
4867,ARGUMENT,Entanglement from which was no escape.
4868,ARGUMENT,"And now the glorious artist, ere he yet                          370"
4869,ARGUMENT,"Had reach'd the Lemnian isle, limping, return'd"
4870,ARGUMENT,"From his feign'd journey, for his spy the sun"
4871,ARGUMENT,Had told him all. With aching heart he sought
4872,ARGUMENT,"His home, and, standing in the vestibule,"
4873,ARGUMENT,"Frantic with indignation roar'd to heav'n,"
4874,ARGUMENT,"And roar'd again, summoning all the Gods.--"
4875,ARGUMENT,Oh Jove! and all ye Pow'rs for ever blest!
4876,ARGUMENT,"Here; hither look, that ye may view a sight"
4877,ARGUMENT,"Ludicrous, yet too monstrous to be borne,"
4878,ARGUMENT,How Venus always with dishonour loads                            380
4879,ARGUMENT,"Her cripple spouse, doating on fiery Mars!"
4880,ARGUMENT,And wherefore? for that he is fair in form
4881,ARGUMENT,"And sound of foot, I ricket-boned and weak."
4882,ARGUMENT,"Whose fault is this? Their fault, and theirs alone"
4883,ARGUMENT,Who gave me being; ill-employ'd were they
4884,ARGUMENT,"Begetting me, one, better far unborn."
4885,ARGUMENT,See where they couch together on my bed
4886,ARGUMENT,"Lascivious! ah, sight hateful to my eyes!"
4887,ARGUMENT,"Yet cooler wishes will they feel, I ween,"
4888,ARGUMENT,To press my bed hereafter; here to sleep                         390
4889,ARGUMENT,"Will little please them, fondly as they love."
4890,ARGUMENT,But these my toils and tangles will suffice
4891,ARGUMENT,"To hold them here, till Jove shall yield me back"
4892,ARGUMENT,"Complete, the sum of all my nuptial gifts"
4893,ARGUMENT,Paid to him for the shameless strumpet's sake
4894,ARGUMENT,"His daughter, as incontinent as fair."
4895,ARGUMENT,"He said, and in the brazen-floor'd abode"
4896,ARGUMENT,Of Jove the Gods assembled. Neptune came
4897,ARGUMENT,"Earth-circling Pow'r; came Hermes friend of man,"
4898,ARGUMENT,"And, regent of the far-commanding bow,                           400"
4899,ARGUMENT,Apollo also came; but chaste reserve
4900,ARGUMENT,Bashful kept all the Goddesses at home.
4901,ARGUMENT,"The Gods, by whose beneficence all live,"
4902,ARGUMENT,Stood in the portal; infinite arose
4903,ARGUMENT,"The laugh of heav'n, all looking down intent"
4904,ARGUMENT,"On that shrewd project of the smith divine,"
4905,ARGUMENT,"And, turning to each other, thus they said."
4906,ARGUMENT,Bad works speed ill. The slow o'ertakes the swift.
4907,ARGUMENT,"So Vulcan, tardy as he is, by craft"
4908,ARGUMENT,"Hath outstript Mars, although the fleetest far                   410"
4909,ARGUMENT,"Of all who dwell in heav'n, and the light-heel'd"
4910,ARGUMENT,Must pay the adult'rer's forfeit to the lame.
4911,ARGUMENT,So spake the Pow'rs immortal; then the King
4912,ARGUMENT,Of radiant shafts thus question'd Mercury.
4913,ARGUMENT,"Jove's son, heaven's herald, Hermes, bounteous God!"
4914,ARGUMENT,Would'st _thou_ such stricture close of bands endure
4915,ARGUMENT,For golden Venus lying at thy side?
4916,ARGUMENT,Whom answer'd thus the messenger of heav'n
4917,ARGUMENT,"Archer divine! yea, and with all my heart;"
4918,ARGUMENT,And be the bands which wind us round about                       420
4919,ARGUMENT,"Thrice these innumerable, and let all"
4920,ARGUMENT,"The Gods and Goddesses in heav'n look on,"
4921,ARGUMENT,So I may clasp Vulcan's fair spouse the while.
4922,ARGUMENT,He spake; then laugh'd the Immortal Pow'rs again.
4923,ARGUMENT,But not so Neptune; he with earnest suit
4924,ARGUMENT,The glorious artist urged to the release
4925,ARGUMENT,"Of Mars, and thus in accents wing'd he said."
4926,ARGUMENT,Loose him; accept my promise; he shall pay
4927,ARGUMENT,Full recompense in presence of us all.
4928,ARGUMENT,Then thus the limping smith far-famed replied.                 430
4929,ARGUMENT,"Earth-circler Neptune, spare me that request."
4930,ARGUMENT,"Lame suitor, lame security.[31] What bands"
4931,ARGUMENT,"Could I devise for thee among the Gods,"
4932,ARGUMENT,"Should Mars, emancipated once, escape,"
4933,ARGUMENT,"Leaving both debt and durance, far behind?"
4934,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then the Shaker of the shores.
4935,ARGUMENT,"I tell thee, Vulcan, that if Mars by flight"
4936,ARGUMENT,"Shun payment, I will pay, myself, the fine."
4937,ARGUMENT,To whom the glorious artist of the skies.
4938,ARGUMENT,"Thou must not, canst not, shalt not be refused.                  440"
4939,ARGUMENT,"So saying, the might of Vulcan loos'd the snare,"
4940,ARGUMENT,"And they, detain'd by those coercive bands"
4941,ARGUMENT,"No longer, from the couch upstarting, flew,"
4942,ARGUMENT,"Mars into Thrace, and to her Paphian home"
4943,ARGUMENT,"The Queen of smiles, where deep in myrtle groves"
4944,ARGUMENT,Her incense-breathing altar stands embow'r'd.
4945,ARGUMENT,"Her there, the Graces laved, and oils diffused"
4946,ARGUMENT,"O'er all her form, ambrosial, such as add"
4947,ARGUMENT,"Fresh beauty to the Gods for ever young,"
4948,ARGUMENT,And cloath'd her in the loveliest robes of heav'n.               450
4949,ARGUMENT,Such was the theme of the illustrious bard.
4950,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses with delight that song, and all"
4951,ARGUMENT,The maritime Phæacian concourse heard.
4952,ARGUMENT,"Alcinoüs, then, (for in the dance they pass'd"
4953,ARGUMENT,"All others) call'd his sons to dance alone,"
4954,ARGUMENT,Halius and Laodamas; they gave
4955,ARGUMENT,"The purple ball into their hands, the work"
4956,ARGUMENT,"Exact of Polybus; one, re-supine,"
4957,ARGUMENT,"Upcast it high toward the dusky clouds,"
4958,ARGUMENT,"The other, springing into air, with ease                         460"
4959,ARGUMENT,"Received it, ere he sank to earth again."
4960,ARGUMENT,When thus they oft had sported with the ball
4961,ARGUMENT,"Thrown upward, next, with nimble interchange"
4962,ARGUMENT,"They pass'd it to each other many a time,"
4963,ARGUMENT,"Footing the plain, while ev'ry youth of all"
4964,ARGUMENT,"The circus clapp'd his hands, and from beneath"
4965,ARGUMENT,The din of stamping feet fill'd all the air.
4966,ARGUMENT,"Then, turning to Alcinoüs, thus the wise"
4967,ARGUMENT,Ulysses spake: Alcinoüs! mighty King!
4968,ARGUMENT,Illustrious above all Phæacia's sons!                            470
4969,ARGUMENT,"Incomparable are ye in the dance,"
4970,ARGUMENT,Ev'n as thou said'st. Amazement-fixt I stand!
4971,ARGUMENT,"So he, whom hearing, the imperial might"
4972,ARGUMENT,"Exulted of Alcinoüs, and aloud"
4973,ARGUMENT,To his oar-skill'd Phæacians thus he spake.
4974,ARGUMENT,"Phæacian Chiefs and Senators, attend!"
4975,ARGUMENT,Wisdom beyond the common stint I mark
4976,ARGUMENT,"In this our guest; good cause in my account,"
4977,ARGUMENT,For which we should present him with a pledge
4978,ARGUMENT,Of hospitality and love. The Chiefs                              480
4979,ARGUMENT,"Are twelve, who, highest in command, controul"
4980,ARGUMENT,"The people, and the thirteenth Chief am I."
4981,ARGUMENT,"Bring each a golden talent, with a vest"
4982,ARGUMENT,"Well-bleach'd, and tunic; gratified with these,"
4983,ARGUMENT,The stranger to our banquet shall repair
4984,ARGUMENT,Exulting; bring them all without delay;
4985,ARGUMENT,And let Euryalus by word and gift
4986,ARGUMENT,"Appease him, for his speech was unadvised."

4988,ARGUMENT,"Each sent his herald forth to bring the gifts,                   490"
4989,ARGUMENT,When thus Euryalus his Sire address'd.
4990,ARGUMENT,Alcinoüs! o'er Phæacia's sons supreme!
4991,ARGUMENT,"I will appease our guest, as thou command'st."
4992,ARGUMENT,"This sword shall be his own, the blade all steel."
4993,ARGUMENT,"The hilt of silver, and the unsullied sheath"
4994,ARGUMENT,"Of iv'ry recent from the carver's hand,"
4995,ARGUMENT,A gift like this he shall not need despise.
4996,ARGUMENT,"So saying, his silver-studded sword he gave"
4997,ARGUMENT,"Into his grasp, and, courteous, thus began."
4998,ARGUMENT,"Hail, honour'd stranger! and if word of mine                   500"
4999,ARGUMENT,"Have harm'd thee, rashly spoken, let the winds"
5000,ARGUMENT,Bear all remembrance of it swift away!
5001,ARGUMENT,May the Gods give thee to behold again
5002,ARGUMENT,"Thy wife, and to attain thy native shore,"
5003,ARGUMENT,"Whence absent long, thou hast so much endured!"
5004,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
5005,ARGUMENT,"Hail also thou, and may the Gods, my friend,"
5006,ARGUMENT,"Grant thee felicity, and may never want"
5007,ARGUMENT,"Of this thy sword touch thee in time to come,"
5008,ARGUMENT,By whose kind phrase appeas'd my wrath subsides!                 510
5009,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and athwart his shoulders threw"
5010,ARGUMENT,"The weapon bright emboss'd. Now sank the sun,"
5011,ARGUMENT,"And those rich gifts arrived, which to the house"
5012,ARGUMENT,Of King Alcinoüs the heralds bore.
5013,ARGUMENT,"Alcinoüs' sons receiv'd them, and beside"
5014,ARGUMENT,Their royal mother placed the precious charge.
5015,ARGUMENT,"The King then led the way, at whose abode"
5016,ARGUMENT,"Arrived, again they press'd their lofty thrones,"
5017,ARGUMENT,And to Areta thus the monarch spake.
5018,ARGUMENT,"Haste, bring a coffer; bring thy best, and store               520"
5019,ARGUMENT,A mantle and a sumptuous vest within;
5020,ARGUMENT,"Warm for him, next, a brazen bath, by which"
5021,ARGUMENT,"Refresh'd, and viewing in fair order placed"
5022,ARGUMENT,The noble gifts by the Phæacian Lords
5023,ARGUMENT,"Conferr'd on him, he may the more enjoy"
5024,ARGUMENT,"Our banquet, and the bard's harmonious song."
5025,ARGUMENT,I give him also this my golden cup
5026,ARGUMENT,"Splendid, elaborate; that, while he lives"
5027,ARGUMENT,What time he pours libation forth to Jove
5028,ARGUMENT,"And all the Gods, he may remember me.                            530"
5029,ARGUMENT,"He ended, at whose words Areta bade"
5030,ARGUMENT,Her maidens with dispatch place o'er the fire
5031,ARGUMENT,A tripod ample-womb'd; obedient they
5032,ARGUMENT,"Advanced a laver to the glowing hearth,"
5033,ARGUMENT,"Water infused, and kindled wood beneath"
5034,ARGUMENT,"The flames encircling bright the bellied vase,"
5035,ARGUMENT,"Warm'd soon the flood within. Meantime, the Queen"
5036,ARGUMENT,Producing from her chamber-stores a chest
5037,ARGUMENT,"All-elegant, within it placed the gold,"
5038,ARGUMENT,"And raiment, gifts of the Phæacian Chiefs,                       540"
5039,ARGUMENT,"With her own gifts, the mantle and the vest,"
5040,ARGUMENT,And in wing'd accents to Ulysses said.
5041,ARGUMENT,"Now take, thyself, the coffer's lid in charge;"
5042,ARGUMENT,"Girdle it quickly with a cord, lest loss"
5043,ARGUMENT,"Befall thee on thy way, while thou perchance"
5044,ARGUMENT,Shalt sleep secure on board the sable bark.
5045,ARGUMENT,"Which when Ulysses heard, Hero renown'd,"
5046,ARGUMENT,"Adjusting close the lid, he cast a cord"
5047,ARGUMENT,Around it which with many a mazy knot
5048,ARGUMENT,"He tied, by Circe taught him long before.                        550"
5049,ARGUMENT,"And now, the mistress of the household charge"
5050,ARGUMENT,Summon'd him to his bath; glad he beheld
5051,ARGUMENT,"The steaming vase, uncustom'd to its use"
5052,ARGUMENT,E'er since his voyage from the isle of fair
5053,ARGUMENT,"Calypso, although, while a guest with her,"
5054,ARGUMENT,"Ever familiar with it, as a God."
5055,ARGUMENT,"Laved by attendant damsels, and with oil"
5056,ARGUMENT,"Refresh'd, he put his sumptuous tunic on"
5057,ARGUMENT,"And mantle, and proceeding from the bath"
5058,ARGUMENT,"To the symposium, join'd the num'rous guests;                    560"
5059,ARGUMENT,"But, as he pass'd, the Princess all divine"
5060,ARGUMENT,"Beside the pillars of the portal, lost"
5061,ARGUMENT,"In admiration of his graceful form,"
5062,ARGUMENT,"Stood, and in accents wing'd him thus address'd."
5063,ARGUMENT,"Hail, stranger! at thy native home arrived"
5064,ARGUMENT,"Remember me, thy first deliv'rer here."
5065,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
5066,ARGUMENT,Nausicaa! daughter of the noble King
5067,ARGUMENT,"Alcinoüs! So may Jove, high-thund'ring mate"
5068,ARGUMENT,"Of Juno, grant me to behold again                                570"
5069,ARGUMENT,"My native land, and my delightful home,"
5070,ARGUMENT,"As, even there, I will present my vows"
5071,ARGUMENT,"To thee, adoring thee as I adore"
5072,ARGUMENT,"The Gods themselves, virgin, by whom I live!"
5073,ARGUMENT,"He said, and on his throne beside the King"
5074,ARGUMENT,Alcinoüs sat. And now they portion'd out
5075,ARGUMENT,"The feast to all, and charg'd the cups with wine,"
5076,ARGUMENT,And introducing by his hand the bard
5077,ARGUMENT,"Phæacia's glory, at the column's side"
5078,ARGUMENT,The herald placed Demodocus again.                               580
5079,ARGUMENT,"Then, carving forth a portion from the loins"
5080,ARGUMENT,"Of a huge brawn, of which uneaten still"
5081,ARGUMENT,"Large part and delicate remain'd, thus spake"
5082,ARGUMENT,Ulysses--Herald! bear it to the bard
5083,ARGUMENT,"For his regale, whom I will soon embrace"
5084,ARGUMENT,In spite of sorrow; for respect is due
5085,ARGUMENT,And veneration to the sacred bard
5086,ARGUMENT,"From all mankind, for that the muse inspires"
5087,ARGUMENT,"Herself his song, and loves the tuneful tribe."
5088,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and the herald bore his charge                       590"
5089,ARGUMENT,To the old hero who with joy received
5090,ARGUMENT,That meed of honour at the bearer's hand.
5091,ARGUMENT,"Then, all, at once, assail'd the ready feast,"
5092,ARGUMENT,"And hunger now, and thirst both satisfied,"
5093,ARGUMENT,Thus to Demodocus Ulysses spake.
5094,ARGUMENT,Demodocus! I give thee praise above
5095,ARGUMENT,"All mortals, for that either thee the muse"
5096,ARGUMENT,"Jove's daughter teaches, or the King, himself,"
5097,ARGUMENT,"Apollo; since thou so record'st the fate,"
5098,ARGUMENT,"With such clear method, of Achaia's host,                        600"
5099,ARGUMENT,"Their deeds heroic, and their num'rous toils,"
5100,ARGUMENT,"As thou hadst present been thyself, or learnt"
5101,ARGUMENT,"From others present there, the glorious tale."
5102,ARGUMENT,"Come, then, proceed; that rare invention sing,"
5103,ARGUMENT,"The horse of wood, which by Minerva's aid"
5104,ARGUMENT,"Epeus framed, and which Ulysses erst"
5105,ARGUMENT,Convey'd into the citadel of Troy
5106,ARGUMENT,"With warriors fill'd, who lay'd all Ilium waste."
5107,ARGUMENT,"These things rehearse regular, and myself"
5108,ARGUMENT,"Will, instant, publish in the ears of all                        610"
5109,ARGUMENT,"Thy fame, reporting thee a bard to whom"
5110,ARGUMENT,Apollo free imparts celestial song.
5111,ARGUMENT,He ended; then Apollo with full force
5112,ARGUMENT,"Rush'd on Demodocus, and he began"
5113,ARGUMENT,"What time the Greeks, first firing their own camp"
5114,ARGUMENT,Steer'd all their galleys from the shore of Troy.
5115,ARGUMENT,"Already, in the horse conceal'd, his band"
5116,ARGUMENT,Around Ulysses sat; for Ilium's sons
5117,ARGUMENT,Themselves had drawn it to the citadel.
5118,ARGUMENT,"And there the mischief stood. Then, strife arose                 620"
5119,ARGUMENT,"Among the Trojans compassing the horse,"
5120,ARGUMENT,And threefold was the doubt; whether to cleave
5121,ARGUMENT,"The hollow trunk asunder, or updrawn"
5122,ARGUMENT,"Aloft, to cast it headlong from the rocks,"
5123,ARGUMENT,"Or to permit the enormous image, kept"
5124,ARGUMENT,"Entire, to stand an off'ring to the Gods,"
5125,ARGUMENT,Which was their destined course; for Fate had fix'd
5126,ARGUMENT,"Their ruin sure, when once they had received"
5127,ARGUMENT,"Within their walls that engine huge, in which"
5128,ARGUMENT,Sat all the bravest Greecians with the fate                      630
5129,ARGUMENT,"Of Ilium charged, and slaughter of her sons."
5130,ARGUMENT,"He sang, how, from the horse effused, the Greeks"
5131,ARGUMENT,"Left their capacious ambush, and the town"
5132,ARGUMENT,"Made desolate. To others, in his song,"
5133,ARGUMENT,"He gave the praise of wasting all beside,"
5134,ARGUMENT,"But told how, fierce as Mars, Ulysses join'd"
5135,ARGUMENT,"With godlike Menelaus, to the house"
5136,ARGUMENT,Flew of Deiphobus; him there engaged
5137,ARGUMENT,"In direst fight he sang, and through the aid"
5138,ARGUMENT,"Of glorious Pallas, conqu'ror over all.                          640"
5139,ARGUMENT,"So sang the bard illustrious, at whose song"
5140,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses melted, and tear after tear"
5141,ARGUMENT,"Fell on his cheeks. As when a woman weeps,"
5142,ARGUMENT,"Her husband, who hath fallen in defence"
5143,ARGUMENT,Of his own city and his babes before
5144,ARGUMENT,"The gates; she, sinking, folds him in her arms"
5145,ARGUMENT,"And, gazing on him as he pants and dies,"
5146,ARGUMENT,"Shrieks at the sight; meantime, the enemy"
5147,ARGUMENT,Smiting her shoulders with the spear to toil
5148,ARGUMENT,"Command her and to bondage far away,                             650"
5149,ARGUMENT,And her cheek fades with horror at the sound;
5150,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, so, from his moist lids let fall,"
5151,ARGUMENT,The frequent tear. Unnoticed by the rest
5152,ARGUMENT,"Those drops, but not by King Alcinoüs, fell"
5153,ARGUMENT,"Who, seated at his side, his heavy sighs"
5154,ARGUMENT,"Remark'd, and the Phæacians thus bespake."
5155,ARGUMENT,Phæacian Chiefs and Senators attend!
5156,ARGUMENT,Now let Demodocus enjoin his harp
5157,ARGUMENT,"Silence, for not alike grateful to all"
5158,ARGUMENT,"His music sounds; during our feast, and since                    660"
5159,ARGUMENT,"The bard divine began, continual flow"
5160,ARGUMENT,"The stranger's sorrows, by remembrance caused"
5161,ARGUMENT,Of some great woe which wraps his soul around.
5162,ARGUMENT,"Then, let the bard suspend his song, that all"
5163,ARGUMENT,"(As most befits th' occasion) may rejoice,"
5164,ARGUMENT,Both guest and hosts together; since we make
5165,ARGUMENT,"This voyage, and these gifts confer, in proof"
5166,ARGUMENT,"Of hospitality and unfeign'd love,"
5167,ARGUMENT,"Judging, with all wise men, the stranger-guest"
5168,ARGUMENT,And suppliant worthy of a brother's place.                       670
5169,ARGUMENT,"And thou conceal not, artfully reserv'd,"
5170,ARGUMENT,"What I shall ask, far better plain declared"
5171,ARGUMENT,"Than smother'd close; who art thou? speak thy name,"
5172,ARGUMENT,"The name by which thy father, mother, friends"
5173,ARGUMENT,"And fellow-citizens, with all who dwell"
5174,ARGUMENT,"Around thy native city, in times past"
5175,ARGUMENT,Have known thee; for of all things human none
5176,ARGUMENT,"Lives altogether nameless, whether good"
5177,ARGUMENT,"Or whether bad, but ev'ry man receives"
5178,ARGUMENT,"Ev'n in the moment of his birth, a name.                         680"
5179,ARGUMENT,"Thy country, people, city, tell; the mark"
5180,ARGUMENT,"At which my ships, intelligent, shall aim,"
5181,ARGUMENT,That they may bear thee thither; for our ships
5182,ARGUMENT,"No pilot need or helm, as ships are wont,"
5183,ARGUMENT,"But know, themselves, our purpose; know beside"
5184,ARGUMENT,"All cities, and all fruitful regions well"
5185,ARGUMENT,"Of all the earth, and with dark clouds involv'd"
5186,ARGUMENT,"Plough rapid the rough Deep, fearless of harm,"
5187,ARGUMENT,(Whate'er betide) and of disast'rous wreck.
5188,ARGUMENT,"Yet thus, long since, my father I have heard                     690"
5189,ARGUMENT,"Nausithoüs speaking; Neptune, he would say,"
5190,ARGUMENT,"Is angry with us, for that safe we bear"
5191,ARGUMENT,Strangers of ev'ry nation to their home;
5192,ARGUMENT,And he foretold a time when he would smite
5193,ARGUMENT,In vengeance some Phæacian gallant bark
5194,ARGUMENT,"Returning after convoy of her charge,"
5195,ARGUMENT,"And fix her in the sable flood, transform'd"
5196,ARGUMENT,"Into a mountain, right before the town."
5197,ARGUMENT,"So spake my hoary Sire, which let the God"
5198,ARGUMENT,"At his own pleasure do, or leave undone.                         700"
5199,ARGUMENT,"But tell me truth, and plainly. Where have been"
5200,ARGUMENT,Thy wand'rings? in what regions of the earth
5201,ARGUMENT,"Hast thou arrived? what nations hast thou seen,"
5202,ARGUMENT,"What cities? say, how many hast thou found"
5203,ARGUMENT,"Harsh, savage and unjust? how many, kind"
5204,ARGUMENT,"To strangers, and disposed to fear the Gods?"
5205,ARGUMENT,"Say also, from what secret grief of heart"
5206,ARGUMENT,"Thy sorrows flow, oft as thou hear'st the fate"
5207,ARGUMENT,"Of the Achaians, or of Ilium sung?"
5208,ARGUMENT,That fate the Gods prepared; they spin the thread                710
5209,ARGUMENT,"Of man's destruction, that in after days"
5210,ARGUMENT,The bard may make the sad event his theme.
5211,ARGUMENT,Perish'd thy father or thy brother there?
5212,ARGUMENT,Or hast thou at the siege of Ilium lost
5213,ARGUMENT,"Father-in-law, or son-in-law? for such"
5214,ARGUMENT,Are next and dearest to us after those
5215,ARGUMENT,Who share our own descent; or was the dead
5216,ARGUMENT,"Thy bosom-friend, whose heart was as thy own?"

5345,ARGUMENT,"We, fearing instant death, within the barks"
5346,ARGUMENT,"Our canvas lodg'd, and, toiling strenuous, reach'd"
5347,ARGUMENT,At length the continent. Two nights we lay
5348,ARGUMENT,"Continual there, and two long days, consumed"
5349,ARGUMENT,With toil and grief; but when the beauteous morn
5350,ARGUMENT,"Bright-hair'd, had brought the third day to a close,"
5351,ARGUMENT,"(Our masts erected, and white sails unfurl'd)"
5352,ARGUMENT,"Again we sat on board; meantime, the winds"
5353,ARGUMENT,"Well managed by the steersman, urged us on."
5354,ARGUMENT,"And now, all danger pass'd, I had attain'd                        90"
5355,ARGUMENT,"My native shore, but, doubling in my course"
5356,ARGUMENT,"Malea, waves and currents and North-winds"
5357,ARGUMENT,Constrain'd me devious to Cythera's isle.
5358,ARGUMENT,Nine days by cruel storms thence was I borne
5359,ARGUMENT,"Athwart the fishy Deep, but on the tenth"
5360,ARGUMENT,"Reach'd the Lotophagi, a race sustain'd"
5361,ARGUMENT,"On sweetest fruit alone. There quitting ship,"
5362,ARGUMENT,"We landed and drew water, and the crews"
5363,ARGUMENT,Beside the vessels took their ev'ning cheer.
5364,ARGUMENT,"When, hasty, we had thus our strength renew'd,                   100"
5365,ARGUMENT,I order'd forth my people to inquire
5366,ARGUMENT,"(Two I selected from the rest, with whom"
5367,ARGUMENT,"I join'd an herald, third) what race of men"
5368,ARGUMENT,"Might there inhabit. They, departing, mix'd"
5369,ARGUMENT,With the Lotophagi; nor hostile aught
5370,ARGUMENT,Or savage the Lotophagi devised
5371,ARGUMENT,"Against our friends, but offer'd to their taste"
5372,ARGUMENT,The lotus; of which fruit what man soe'er
5373,ARGUMENT,"Once tasted, no desire felt he to come"
5374,ARGUMENT,"With tidings back, or seek his country more,                     110"
5375,ARGUMENT,But rather wish'd to feed on lotus still
5376,ARGUMENT,"With the Lotophagi, and to renounce"
5377,ARGUMENT,"All thoughts of home. Them, therefore, I constrain'd"
5378,ARGUMENT,"Weeping on board, and dragging each beneath"
5379,ARGUMENT,"The benches, bound him there. Then, all in haste,"
5380,ARGUMENT,I urged my people to ascend again
5381,ARGUMENT,"Their hollow barks, lest others also, fed"
5382,ARGUMENT,"With fruit of lotus, should forget their home."
5383,ARGUMENT,"They quick embark'd, and on the benches ranged"
5384,ARGUMENT,"In order, thresh'd with oars the foamy flood.                    120"
5385,ARGUMENT,"Thence, o'er the Deep proceeding sad, we reach'd"
5386,ARGUMENT,"The land at length, where, giant-sized[32] and free"
5387,ARGUMENT,"From all constraint of law, the Cyclops dwell."
5388,ARGUMENT,"They, trusting to the Gods, plant not, or plough,"
5389,ARGUMENT,"But earth unsow'd, untill'd, brings forth for them"
5390,ARGUMENT,"All fruits, wheat, barley, and the vinous grape"
5391,ARGUMENT,"Large cluster'd, nourish'd by the show'rs of Jove."
5392,ARGUMENT,"No councils they convene, no laws contrive,"
5393,ARGUMENT,"But in deep caverns dwell, found on the heads"
5394,ARGUMENT,"Of lofty mountains, judging each supreme                         130"
5395,ARGUMENT,"His wife and children, heedless of the rest."
5396,ARGUMENT,In front of the Cyclopean haven lies
5397,ARGUMENT,"A level island, not adjoining close"
5398,ARGUMENT,"Their land, nor yet remote, woody and rude."
5399,ARGUMENT,"There, wild goats breed numberless, by no foot"
5400,ARGUMENT,"Of man molested; never huntsman there,"
5401,ARGUMENT,"Inured to winter's cold and hunger, roams"
5402,ARGUMENT,"The dreary woods, or mountain-tops sublime;"
5403,ARGUMENT,"No fleecy flocks dwell there, nor plough is known,"
5404,ARGUMENT,"But the unseeded and unfurrow'd soil,                            140"
5405,ARGUMENT,Year after year a wilderness by man
5406,ARGUMENT,"Untrodden, food for blatant goats supplies."
5407,ARGUMENT,"For no ships crimson-prow'd the Cyclops own,"
5408,ARGUMENT,"Nor naval artizan is there, whose toil"
5409,ARGUMENT,"Might furnish them with oary barks, by which"
5410,ARGUMENT,"Subsists all distant commerce, and which bear"
5411,ARGUMENT,Man o'er the Deep to cities far remote
5412,ARGUMENT,"Who might improve the peopled isle, that seems"
5413,ARGUMENT,"Not steril in itself, but apt to yield,"
5414,ARGUMENT,"In their due season, fruits of ev'ry kind.                       150"
5415,ARGUMENT,For stretch'd beside the hoary ocean lie
5416,ARGUMENT,"Green meadows moist, where vines would never fail;"
5417,ARGUMENT,"Light is the land, and they might yearly reap"
5418,ARGUMENT,"The tallest crops, so unctuous is the glebe."
5419,ARGUMENT,"Safe is its haven also, where no need"
5420,ARGUMENT,"Of cable is or anchor, or to lash"
5421,ARGUMENT,"The hawser fast ashore, but pushing in"
5422,ARGUMENT,"His bark, the mariner might there abide"
5423,ARGUMENT,Till rising gales should tempt him forth again.
5424,ARGUMENT,At bottom of the bay runs a clear stream                         160
5425,ARGUMENT,Issuing from a cove hemm'd all around
5426,ARGUMENT,With poplars; down into that bay we steer'd
5427,ARGUMENT,"Amid the darkness of the night, some God"
5428,ARGUMENT,"Conducting us; for all unseen it lay,"
5429,ARGUMENT,"Such gloom involved the fleet, nor shone the moon"
5430,ARGUMENT,"From heav'n to light us, veil'd by pitchy clouds."
5431,ARGUMENT,"Hence, none the isle descried, nor any saw"
5432,ARGUMENT,"The lofty surge roll'd on the strand, or ere"
5433,ARGUMENT,"Our vessels struck the ground; but when they struck,"
5434,ARGUMENT,"Then, low'ring all our sails, we disembark'd,                    170"
5435,ARGUMENT,And on the sea-beach slept till dawn appear'd.
5436,ARGUMENT,"Soon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn,"
5437,ARGUMENT,"Look'd rosy forth, we with admiring eyes"
5438,ARGUMENT,"The isle survey'd, roaming it wide around."
5439,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, the nymphs, Jove's daughters, roused the goats"
5440,ARGUMENT,"Bred on the mountains, to supply with food"
5441,ARGUMENT,"The partners of my toils; then, bringing forth"
5442,ARGUMENT,"Bows and long-pointed javelins from the ships,"
5443,ARGUMENT,Divided all into three sep'rate bands
5444,ARGUMENT,"We struck them, and the Gods gave us much prey.                  180"
5445,ARGUMENT,"Twelve ships attended me, and ev'ry ship"
5446,ARGUMENT,Nine goats received by lot; myself alone
5447,ARGUMENT,"Selected ten. All day, till set of sun,"
5448,ARGUMENT,"We eating sat goat's flesh, and drinking wine"
5449,ARGUMENT,"Delicious, without stint; for dearth was none"
5450,ARGUMENT,"Of ruddy wine on board, but much remain'd,"
5451,ARGUMENT,With which my people had their jars supplied
5452,ARGUMENT,What time we sack'd Ciconian Ismarus.
5453,ARGUMENT,Thence looking forth toward the neighbour-land
5454,ARGUMENT,"Where dwell the Cyclops, rising smoke we saw,                    190"
5455,ARGUMENT,"And voices heard, their own, and of their flocks."
5456,ARGUMENT,"Now sank the sun, and (night o'ershadowing all)"
5457,ARGUMENT,We slept along the shore; but when again
5458,ARGUMENT,The rosy-finger'd daughter of the dawn
5459,ARGUMENT,"Look'd forth, my crews convened, I thus began."
5460,ARGUMENT,"Companions of my course! here rest ye all,"
5461,ARGUMENT,"Save my own crew, with whom I will explore"
5462,ARGUMENT,"This people, whether wild, they be, unjust,"
5463,ARGUMENT,"And to contention giv'n, or well-disposed"
5464,ARGUMENT,"To strangers, and a race who fear the Gods.                      200"
5465,ARGUMENT,"So speaking, I embark'd, and bade embark"
5466,ARGUMENT,"My followers, throwing, quick, the hawsers loose."
5467,ARGUMENT,"They, ent'ring at my word, the benches fill'd"
5468,ARGUMENT,"Well-ranged, and thresh'd with oars the foamy flood."
5469,ARGUMENT,"Attaining soon that neighbour-land, we found"
5470,ARGUMENT,"At its extremity, fast by the sea,"
5471,ARGUMENT,"A cavern, lofty, and dark-brow'd above"
5472,ARGUMENT,With laurels; in that cavern slumb'ring lay
5473,ARGUMENT,"Much cattle, sheep and goats, and a broad court"
5474,ARGUMENT,"Enclosed it, fenced with stones from quarries hewn,              210"
5475,ARGUMENT,"With spiry firs, and oaks of ample bough."
5476,ARGUMENT,"Here dwelt a giant vast, who far remote"
5477,ARGUMENT,"His flocks fed solitary, converse none"
5478,ARGUMENT,"Desiring, sullen, savage, and unjust."
5479,ARGUMENT,"Monster, in truth, he was, hideous in form,"
5480,ARGUMENT,Resembling less a man by Ceres' gift
5481,ARGUMENT,"Sustain'd, than some aspiring mountain-crag"
5482,ARGUMENT,"Tufted with wood, and standing all alone."
5483,ARGUMENT,"Enjoining, then, my people to abide"
5484,ARGUMENT,"Fast by the ship which they should closely guard,                220"
5485,ARGUMENT,"I went, but not without a goat-skin fill'd"
5486,ARGUMENT,With sable wine which I had erst received
5487,ARGUMENT,"From Maron, offspring of Evanthes, priest"
5488,ARGUMENT,"Of Phœbus guardian god of Ismarus,"
5489,ARGUMENT,"Because, through rev'rence of him, we had saved"
5490,ARGUMENT,"Himself, his wife and children; for he dwelt"
5491,ARGUMENT,Amid the grove umbrageous of his God.
5492,ARGUMENT,"He gave me, therefore, noble gifts; from him"
5493,ARGUMENT,"Sev'n talents I received of beaten gold,"
5494,ARGUMENT,"A beaker, argent all, and after these                            230"
5495,ARGUMENT,"No fewer than twelve jars with wine replete,"
5496,ARGUMENT,"Rich, unadult'rate, drink for Gods; nor knew"
5497,ARGUMENT,"One servant, male or female, of that wine"
5498,ARGUMENT,"In all his house; none knew it, save himself,"
5499,ARGUMENT,"His wife, and the intendant of his stores."
5500,ARGUMENT,"Oft as they drank that luscious juice, he slaked"
5501,ARGUMENT,"A single cup with twenty from the stream,"
5502,ARGUMENT,"And, even then, the beaker breath'd abroad"
5503,ARGUMENT,"A scent celestial, which whoever smelt,"
5504,ARGUMENT,Thenceforth no pleasure found it to abstain.                     240
5505,ARGUMENT,Charged with an ample goat-skin of this wine
5506,ARGUMENT,"I went, and with a wallet well supplied,"
5507,ARGUMENT,But felt a sudden presage in my soul
5508,ARGUMENT,"That, haply, with terrific force endued,"
5509,ARGUMENT,"Some savage would appear, strange to the laws"
5510,ARGUMENT,And privileges of the human race.
5511,ARGUMENT,"Few steps convey'd us to his den, but him"
5512,ARGUMENT,We found not; he his flocks pastur'd abroad.
5513,ARGUMENT,"His cavern ent'ring, we with wonder gazed"
5514,ARGUMENT,Around on all; his strainers hung with cheese                    250
5515,ARGUMENT,Distended wide; with lambs and kids his penns
5516,ARGUMENT,"Close-throng'd we saw, and folded separate"
5517,ARGUMENT,"The various charge; the eldest all apart,"
5518,ARGUMENT,"Apart the middle-aged, and the new-yean'd"
5519,ARGUMENT,Also apart. His pails and bowls with whey
5520,ARGUMENT,"Swam all, neat vessels into which he milk'd."
5521,ARGUMENT,Me then my friends first importuned to take
5522,ARGUMENT,"A portion of his cheeses, then to drive"
5523,ARGUMENT,Forth from the sheep-cotes to the rapid bark
5524,ARGUMENT,"His kids and lambs, and plow the brine again.                    260"
5525,ARGUMENT,"But me they moved not, happier had they moved!"
5526,ARGUMENT,"I wish'd to see him, and to gain, perchance,"
5527,ARGUMENT,"Some pledge of hospitality at his hands,"
5528,ARGUMENT,"Whose form was such, as should not much bespeak"
5529,ARGUMENT,"When he appear'd, our confidence or love."
5530,ARGUMENT,"Then, kindling fire, we offer'd to the Gods,"
5531,ARGUMENT,"And of his cheeses eating, patient sat"
5532,ARGUMENT,Till home he trudged from pasture. Charged he came
5533,ARGUMENT,"With dry wood bundled, an enormous load"
5534,ARGUMENT,Fuel by which to sup. Loud crash'd the thorns                    270
5535,ARGUMENT,"Which down he cast before the cavern's mouth,"
5536,ARGUMENT,To whose interior nooks we trembling flew.
5537,ARGUMENT,At once he drove into his spacious cave
5538,ARGUMENT,"His batten'd flock, all those which gave him milk,"
5539,ARGUMENT,"But all the males, both rams and goats, he left"
5540,ARGUMENT,"Abroad, excluded from the cavern-yard."
5541,ARGUMENT,"Upheaving, next, a rocky barrier huge"
5542,ARGUMENT,"To his cave's mouth, he thrust it home. That weight"
5543,ARGUMENT,Not all the oxen from its place had moved
5544,ARGUMENT,Of twenty and two wains; with such a rock                        280
5545,ARGUMENT,"Immense his den he closed. Then down he sat,"
5546,ARGUMENT,And as he milk'd his ewes and bleating goats
5547,ARGUMENT,"All in their turns, her yeanling gave to each;"
5548,ARGUMENT,"Coagulating, then, with brisk dispatch,"
5549,ARGUMENT,"The half of his new milk, he thrust the curd"
5550,ARGUMENT,"Into his wicker sieves, but stored the rest"
5551,ARGUMENT,In pans and bowls--his customary drink.
5552,ARGUMENT,"His labours thus perform'd, he kindled, last,"
5553,ARGUMENT,"His fuel, and discerning _us_, enquired,"
5554,ARGUMENT,"Who are ye, strangers? from what distant shore                 290"
5555,ARGUMENT,Roam ye the waters? traffic ye? or bound
5556,ARGUMENT,"To no one port, wander, as pirates use,"
5557,ARGUMENT,"At large the Deep, exposing life themselves,"
5558,ARGUMENT,And enemies of all mankind beside?
5559,ARGUMENT,"He ceased; we, dash'd with terrour, heard the growl"
5560,ARGUMENT,"Of his big voice, and view'd his form uncouth,"
5561,ARGUMENT,"To whom, though sore appall'd, I thus replied."
5562,ARGUMENT,"Of Greece are we, and, bound from Ilium home,"
5563,ARGUMENT,"Have wander'd wide the expanse of ocean, sport"
5564,ARGUMENT,"For ev'ry wind, and driven from our course,                      300"
5565,ARGUMENT,Have here arrived; so stood the will of Jove.
5566,ARGUMENT,"We boast ourselves of Agamemnon's train,"
5567,ARGUMENT,"The son of Atreus, at this hour the Chief"
5568,ARGUMENT,"Beyond all others under heav'n renown'd,"
5569,ARGUMENT,So great a city he hath sack'd and slain
5570,ARGUMENT,"Such num'rous foes; but since we reach, at last,"
5571,ARGUMENT,"Thy knees, we beg such hospitable fare,"
5572,ARGUMENT,"Or other gift, as guests are wont to obtain."
5573,ARGUMENT,"Illustrious lord! respect the Gods, and us"
5574,ARGUMENT,Thy suitors; suppliants are the care of Jove                     310
5575,ARGUMENT,The hospitable; he their wrongs resents
5576,ARGUMENT,"And where the stranger sojourns, there is he."
5577,ARGUMENT,"I ceas'd, when answer thus he, fierce, return'd."
5578,ARGUMENT,"Friend! either thou art fool, or hast arrived"
5579,ARGUMENT,"Indeed from far, who bidd'st me fear the Gods"
5580,ARGUMENT,Lest they be wroth. The Cyclops little heeds
5581,ARGUMENT,"Jove Ægis-arm'd, or all the Pow'rs of heav'n."
5582,ARGUMENT,"Our race is mightier far; nor shall myself,"
5583,ARGUMENT,"Through fear of Jove's hostility, abstain"
5584,ARGUMENT,"From thee or thine, unless my choice be such.                    320"
5585,ARGUMENT,But tell me now. Where touch'd thy gallant bark
5586,ARGUMENT,"Our country, on thy first arrival here?"
5587,ARGUMENT,Remote or nigh? for I would learn the truth.
5588,ARGUMENT,"So spake he, tempting me; but, artful, thus"
5589,ARGUMENT,"I answer'd, penetrating his intent."
5590,ARGUMENT,"My vessel, Neptune, Shaker of the shores,"
5591,ARGUMENT,At yonder utmost promontory dash'd
5592,ARGUMENT,"In pieces, hurling her against the rocks"
5593,ARGUMENT,"With winds that blew right thither from the sea,"
5594,ARGUMENT,"And I, with these alone, escaped alive.                          330"
5595,ARGUMENT,"So I, to whom, relentless, answer none"
5596,ARGUMENT,"He deign'd, but, with his arms extended, sprang"
5597,ARGUMENT,"Toward my people, of whom seizing two"
5598,ARGUMENT,"At once, like whelps against his cavern-floor"
5599,ARGUMENT,"He dash'd them, and their brains spread on the ground."
5600,ARGUMENT,"These, piece-meal hewn, for supper he prepared,"
5601,ARGUMENT,"And, like a mountain-lion, neither flesh"
5602,ARGUMENT,"Nor entrails left, nor yet their marrowy bones."
5603,ARGUMENT,"We, viewing that tremendous sight, upraised"
5604,ARGUMENT,"Our hands to Jove, all hope and courage lost.                    340"
5605,ARGUMENT,When thus the Cyclops had with human flesh
5606,ARGUMENT,"Fill'd his capacious belly, and had quaff'd"
5607,ARGUMENT,"Much undiluted milk, among his flocks"
5608,ARGUMENT,"Out-stretch'd immense, he press'd his cavern-floor."
5609,ARGUMENT,"Me, then, my courage prompted to approach"
5610,ARGUMENT,"The monster with my sword drawn from the sheath,"
5611,ARGUMENT,And to transfix him where the vitals wrap
5612,ARGUMENT,The liver; but maturer thoughts forbad.
5613,ARGUMENT,"For so, we also had incurred a death"
5614,ARGUMENT,"Tremendous, wanting pow'r to thrust aside                        350"
5615,ARGUMENT,The rocky mass that closed his cavern-mouth
5616,ARGUMENT,By force of hand alone. Thus many a sigh
5617,ARGUMENT,"Heaving, we watch'd the dawn. But when, at length,"
5618,ARGUMENT,"Aurora, day-spring's daughter rosy-palm'd"
5619,ARGUMENT,"Look'd forth, then, kindling fire, his flocks he milk'd"
5620,ARGUMENT,"In order, and her yeanling kid or lamb"
5621,ARGUMENT,Thrust under each. When thus he had perform'd
5622,ARGUMENT,"His wonted task, two seizing, as before,"
5623,ARGUMENT,He slew them for his next obscene regale.
5624,ARGUMENT,"His dinner ended, from the cave he drove                         360"
5625,ARGUMENT,"His fatted flocks abroad, moving with ease"
5626,ARGUMENT,"That pond'rous barrier, and replacing it"
5627,ARGUMENT,As he had only closed a quiver's lid.
5628,ARGUMENT,"Then, hissing them along, he drove his flocks"
5629,ARGUMENT,"Toward the mountain, and me left, the while,"
5630,ARGUMENT,Deep ruminating how I best might take
5631,ARGUMENT,"Vengeance, and by the aid of Pallas win"
5632,ARGUMENT,Deathless renown. This counsel pleas'd me most.
5633,ARGUMENT,Beside the sheep-cote lay a massy club
5634,ARGUMENT,"Hewn by the Cyclops from an olive stock,                         370"
5635,ARGUMENT,"Green, but which dried, should serve him for a staff."
5636,ARGUMENT,"To us consid'ring it, that staff appear'd"
5637,ARGUMENT,"Tall as the mast of a huge trading bark,"
5638,ARGUMENT,Impell'd by twenty rowers o'er the Deep.
5639,ARGUMENT,"Such seem'd its length to us, and such its bulk."
5640,ARGUMENT,"Part amputating, (an whole fathom's length)"
5641,ARGUMENT,"I gave my men that portion, with command"
5642,ARGUMENT,"To shave it smooth. They smooth'd it, and myself,"
5643,ARGUMENT,"Shaping its blunt extremity to a point,"
5644,ARGUMENT,Season'd it in the fire; then cov'ring close                     380
5645,ARGUMENT,"The weapon, hid it under litter'd straw,"
5646,ARGUMENT,For much lay scatter'd on the cavern-floor.
5647,ARGUMENT,And now I bade my people cast the lot
5648,ARGUMENT,"Who of us all should take the pointed brand,"
5649,ARGUMENT,And grind it in his eye when next he slept.
5650,ARGUMENT,"The lots were cast, and four were chosen, those"
5651,ARGUMENT,"Whom most I wish'd, and I was chosen fifth."
5652,ARGUMENT,"At even-tide he came, his fleecy flocks"
5653,ARGUMENT,"Pasturing homeward, and compell'd them all"
5654,ARGUMENT,"Into his cavern, leaving none abroad,                            390"
5655,ARGUMENT,"Either through some surmise, or so inclined"
5656,ARGUMENT,"By influence, haply, of the Gods themselves."
5657,ARGUMENT,The huge rock pull'd into its place again
5658,ARGUMENT,"At the cave's mouth, he, sitting, milk'd his sheep"
5659,ARGUMENT,"And goats in order, and her kid or lamb"
5660,ARGUMENT,"Thrust under each; thus, all his work dispatch'd,"
5661,ARGUMENT,"Two more he seiz'd, and to his supper fell."
5662,ARGUMENT,"I then, approaching to him, thus address'd"
5663,ARGUMENT,"The Cyclops, holding in my hands a cup"
5664,ARGUMENT,"Of ivy-wood, well-charg'd with ruddy wine.                       400"
5665,ARGUMENT,"Lo, Cyclops! this is wine. Take this and drink"
5666,ARGUMENT,After thy meal of man's flesh. Taste and learn
5667,ARGUMENT,What precious liquor our lost vessel bore.
5668,ARGUMENT,"I brought it hither, purposing to make"
5669,ARGUMENT,"Libation to thee, if to pity inclined"
5670,ARGUMENT,"Thou would'st dismiss us home. But, ah, thy rage"
5671,ARGUMENT,Is insupportable! thou cruel one!
5672,ARGUMENT,"Who, thinkest thou, of all mankind, henceforth"
5673,ARGUMENT,"Will visit _thee_, guilty of such excess?"
5674,ARGUMENT,"I ceas'd. He took and drank, and hugely pleas'd[33]            410"
5675,ARGUMENT,"With that delicious bev'rage, thus enquir'd."
5676,ARGUMENT,"Give me again, and spare not. Tell me, too,"
5677,ARGUMENT,"Thy name, incontinent, that I may make"
5678,ARGUMENT,"Requital, gratifying also thee"
5679,ARGUMENT,With somewhat to thy taste. We Cyclops own
5680,ARGUMENT,"A bounteous soil, which yields _us_ also wine"
5681,ARGUMENT,"From clusters large, nourish'd by show'rs from Jove;"
5682,ARGUMENT,But this--this is from above--a stream
5683,ARGUMENT,"Of nectar and ambrosia, all divine!"
5684,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and received a second draught,                       420"
5685,ARGUMENT,"Like measure. Thrice I bore it to his hand,"
5686,ARGUMENT,"And, foolish, thrice he drank. But when the fumes"
5687,ARGUMENT,"Began to play around the Cyclops' brain,"
5688,ARGUMENT,With show of amity I thus replied.
5689,ARGUMENT,"Cyclops! thou hast my noble name enquired,"
5690,ARGUMENT,"Which I will tell thee. Give me, in return,"
5691,ARGUMENT,"The promised boon, some hospitable pledge."
5692,ARGUMENT,"My name is Outis,[34] Outis I am call'd"
5693,ARGUMENT,"At home, abroad; wherever I am known."
5694,ARGUMENT,"So I; to whom he, savage, thus replied.                        430"
5695,ARGUMENT,"Outis, when I have eaten all his friends,"
5696,ARGUMENT,Shall be my last regale. Be that thy boon.
5697,ARGUMENT,"He spake, and, downward sway'd, fell resupine,"
5698,ARGUMENT,With his huge neck aslant. All-conqu'ring sleep
5699,ARGUMENT,Soon seized him. From his gullet gush'd the wine
5700,ARGUMENT,"With human morsels mingled, many a blast"
5701,ARGUMENT,Sonorous issuing from his glutted maw.
5702,ARGUMENT,"Then, thrusting far the spike of olive-wood"
5703,ARGUMENT,"Into the embers glowing on the hearth,"
5704,ARGUMENT,"I heated it, and cheer'd my friends, the while,                  440"
5705,ARGUMENT,"Lest any should, through fear, shrink from his part."
5706,ARGUMENT,"But when that stake of olive-wood, though green,"
5707,ARGUMENT,"Should soon have flamed, for it was glowing hot,"
5708,ARGUMENT,I bore it to his side. Then all my aids
5709,ARGUMENT,"Around me gather'd, and the Gods infused"
5710,ARGUMENT,Heroic fortitude into our hearts.
5711,ARGUMENT,"They, seizing the hot stake rasp'd to a point,"
5712,ARGUMENT,"Bored his eye with it, and myself, advanced"
5713,ARGUMENT,"To a superior stand, twirled it about."
5714,ARGUMENT,As when a shipwright with his wimble bores                       450
5715,ARGUMENT,"Tough oaken timber, placed on either side"
5716,ARGUMENT,"Below, his fellow-artists strain the thong"
5717,ARGUMENT,"Alternate, and the restless iron spins,"
5718,ARGUMENT,"So, grasping hard the stake pointed with fire,"
5719,ARGUMENT,We twirl'd it in his eye; the bubbling blood
5720,ARGUMENT,Boil'd round about the brand; his pupil sent
5721,ARGUMENT,"A scalding vapour forth that sing'd his brow,"
5722,ARGUMENT,And all his eye-roots crackled in the flame.
5723,ARGUMENT,As when the smith an hatchet or large axe
5724,ARGUMENT,"Temp'ring with skill, plunges the hissing blade                  460"
5725,ARGUMENT,"Deep in cold water, (whence the strength of steel)"
5726,ARGUMENT,So hiss'd his eye around the olive-wood.
5727,ARGUMENT,The howling monster with his outcry fill'd
5728,ARGUMENT,"The hollow rock, and I, with all my aids,"
5729,ARGUMENT,"Fled terrified. He, plucking forth the spike"
5730,ARGUMENT,"From his burnt socket, mad with anguish, cast"
5731,ARGUMENT,The implement all bloody far away.
5732,ARGUMENT,"Then, bellowing, he sounded forth the name"
5733,ARGUMENT,Of ev'ry Cyclops dwelling in the caves
5734,ARGUMENT,"Around him, on the wind-swept mountain-tops;                     470"
5735,ARGUMENT,"They, at his cry flocking from ev'ry part,"
5736,ARGUMENT,"Circled his den, and of his ail enquired."
5737,ARGUMENT,"What grievous hurt hath caused thee, Polypheme!"
5738,ARGUMENT,Thus yelling to alarm the peaceful ear
5739,ARGUMENT,"Of night, and break our slumbers? Fear'st thou lest"
5740,ARGUMENT,Some mortal man drive off thy flocks? or fear'st
5741,ARGUMENT,Thyself to die by cunning or by force?
5742,ARGUMENT,"Them answer'd, then, Polypheme from his cave."
5743,ARGUMENT,"Oh, friends! I die! and Outis gives the blow."
5744,ARGUMENT,To whom with accents wing'd his friends without.               480
5745,ARGUMENT,"If no man[35] harm thee, but thou art alone,"
5746,ARGUMENT,"And sickness feel'st, it is the stroke of Jove,"
5747,ARGUMENT,And thou must bear it; yet invoke for aid
5748,ARGUMENT,"Thy father Neptune, Sovereign of the floods."
5749,ARGUMENT,"So saying, they went, and in my heart I laugh'd"
5750,ARGUMENT,"That by the fiction only of a name,"
5751,ARGUMENT,Slight stratagem! I had deceived them all.
5752,ARGUMENT,"Then groan'd the Cyclops wrung with pain and grief,"
5753,ARGUMENT,"And, fumbling, with stretch'd hands, removed the rock"
5754,ARGUMENT,"From his cave's mouth, which done, he sat him down               490"
5755,ARGUMENT,"Spreading his arms athwart the pass, to stop"
5756,ARGUMENT,"Our egress with his flocks abroad; so dull,"
5757,ARGUMENT,"It seems, he held me, and so ill-advised."
5758,ARGUMENT,"I, pondering what means might fittest prove"
5759,ARGUMENT,"To save from instant death, (if save I might)"
5760,ARGUMENT,"My people and myself, to ev'ry shift"
5761,ARGUMENT,"Inclined, and various counsels framed, as one"
5762,ARGUMENT,"Who strove for life, conscious of woe at hand."
5763,ARGUMENT,"To me, thus meditating, this appear'd"
5764,ARGUMENT,"The likeliest course. The rams well-thriven were,                500"
5765,ARGUMENT,"Thick-fleeced, full-sized, with wool of sable hue."
5766,ARGUMENT,"These, silently, with osier twigs on which"
5767,ARGUMENT,"The Cyclops, hideous monster, slept, I bound,"
5768,ARGUMENT,Three in one leash; the intermediate rams
5769,ARGUMENT,"Bore each a man, whom the exterior two"
5770,ARGUMENT,"Preserved, concealing him on either side."
5771,ARGUMENT,"Thus each was borne by three, and I, at last,"
5772,ARGUMENT,"The curl'd back seizing of a ram, (for one"
5773,ARGUMENT,I had reserv'd far stateliest of them all)
5774,ARGUMENT,"Slipp'd underneath his belly, and both hands                     510"
5775,ARGUMENT,"Enfolding fast in his exub'rant fleece,"
5776,ARGUMENT,Clung ceaseless to him as I lay supine.
5777,ARGUMENT,"We, thus disposed, waited with many a sigh"
5778,ARGUMENT,"The sacred dawn; but when, at length, aris'n,"
5779,ARGUMENT,"Aurora, day-spring's daughter rosy-palm'd"
5780,ARGUMENT,"Again appear'd, the males of all his flocks"
5781,ARGUMENT,"Rush'd forth to pasture, and, meantime, unmilk'd,"
5782,ARGUMENT,"The wethers bleated, by the load distress'd"
5783,ARGUMENT,"Of udders overcharged. Their master, rack'd"
5784,ARGUMENT,"With pain intolerable, handled yet                               520"
5785,ARGUMENT,"The backs of all, inquisitive, as they stood,"
5786,ARGUMENT,"But, gross of intellect, suspicion none"
5787,ARGUMENT,Conceiv'd of men beneath their bodies bound.
5788,ARGUMENT,And now (none left beside) the ram approach'd
5789,ARGUMENT,"With his own wool burthen'd, and with myself,"
5790,ARGUMENT,Whom many a fear molested. Polypheme
5791,ARGUMENT,"The giant stroak'd him as he sat, and said,"
5792,ARGUMENT,My darling ram! why latest of the flock
5793,ARGUMENT,"Com'st thou, whom never, heretofore, my sheep"
5794,ARGUMENT,"Could leave behind, but stalking at their head,                  530"
5795,ARGUMENT,"Thou first was wont to crop the tender grass,"
5796,ARGUMENT,"First to arrive at the clear stream, and first"
5797,ARGUMENT,With ready will to seek my sheep-cote here
5798,ARGUMENT,"At evening; but, thy practice chang'd, thou com'st,"
5799,ARGUMENT,"Now last of all. Feel'st thou regret, my ram!"
5800,ARGUMENT,"Of thy poor master's eye, by a vile wretch"
5801,ARGUMENT,"Bored out, who overcame me first with wine,"
5802,ARGUMENT,"And by a crew of vagabonds accurs'd,"
5803,ARGUMENT,"Followers of Outis, whose escape from death"
5804,ARGUMENT,Shall not be made to-day? Ah! that thy heart                     540
5805,ARGUMENT,"Were as my own, and that distinct as I"
5806,ARGUMENT,"Thou could'st articulate, so should'st thou tell,"
5807,ARGUMENT,"Where hidden, he eludes my furious wrath."
5808,ARGUMENT,"Then, dash'd against the floor his spatter'd brain"
5809,ARGUMENT,"Should fly, and I should lighter feel my harm"
5810,ARGUMENT,"From Outis, wretch base-named and nothing-worth."
5811,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he left him to pursue the flock."
5812,ARGUMENT,"When, thus drawn forth, we had, at length, escaped"
5813,ARGUMENT,"Few paces from the cavern and the court,"
5814,ARGUMENT,"First, quitting my own ram, I loos'd my friends,                 550"
5815,ARGUMENT,"Then, turning seaward many a thriven ewe"
5816,ARGUMENT,"Sharp-hoof'd, we drove them swiftly to the ship."
5817,ARGUMENT,Thrice welcome to our faithful friends we came
5818,ARGUMENT,"From death escaped, but much they mourn'd the dead."
5819,ARGUMENT,"I suffer'd not their tears, but silent shook"
5820,ARGUMENT,"My brows, by signs commanding them to lift"
5821,ARGUMENT,"The sheep on board, and instant plow the main."
5822,ARGUMENT,"They, quick embarking, on the benches sat"
5823,ARGUMENT,"Well ranged, and thresh'd with oars the foamy flood;"
5824,ARGUMENT,But distant now such length as a loud voice                      560
5825,ARGUMENT,"May reach, I hail'd with taunts the Cyclops' ear."
5826,ARGUMENT,Cyclops! when thou devouredst in thy cave
5827,ARGUMENT,"With brutal force my followers, thou devour'dst"
5828,ARGUMENT,"The followers of no timid Chief, or base,"
5829,ARGUMENT,Vengeance was sure to recompense that deed
5830,ARGUMENT,Atrocious. Monster! who wast not afraid
5831,ARGUMENT,To eat the guest shelter'd beneath thy roof!
5832,ARGUMENT,Therefore the Gods have well requited thee.
5833,ARGUMENT,"I ended; he, exasp'rate, raged the more,"
5834,ARGUMENT,"And rending from its hold a mountain-top,                        570"
5835,ARGUMENT,Hurl'd it toward us; at our vessel's stern
5836,ARGUMENT,"Down came the mass, nigh sweeping in its fall"
5837,ARGUMENT,The rudder's head. The ocean at the plunge
5838,ARGUMENT,"Of that huge rock, high on its refluent flood"
5839,ARGUMENT,"Heav'd, irresistible, the ship to land."
5840,ARGUMENT,"I seizing, quick, our longest pole on board,"
5841,ARGUMENT,Back thrust her from the coast and by a nod
5842,ARGUMENT,"In silence given, bade my companions ply"
5843,ARGUMENT,"Strenuous their oars, that so we might escape."
5844,ARGUMENT,"Procumbent,[36] each obey'd, and when, the flood                 580"
5845,ARGUMENT,"Cleaving, we twice that distance had obtain'd,[37]"
5846,ARGUMENT,Again I hail'd the Cyclops; but my friends
5847,ARGUMENT,Earnest dissuaded me on ev'ry side.
5848,ARGUMENT,"Ah, rash Ulysses! why with taunts provoke"
5849,ARGUMENT,"The savage more, who hath this moment hurl'd"
5850,ARGUMENT,"A weapon, such as heav'd the ship again"
5851,ARGUMENT,"To land, where death seem'd certain to us all?"
5852,ARGUMENT,"For had he heard a cry, or but the voice"
5853,ARGUMENT,"Of one man speaking, he had all our heads"
5854,ARGUMENT,"With some sharp rock, and all our timbers crush'd                590"
5855,ARGUMENT,"Together, such vast force is in his arm."
5856,ARGUMENT,"So they, but my courageous heart remain'd"
5857,ARGUMENT,"Unmoved, and thus again, incensed, I spake."
5858,ARGUMENT,Cyclops! should any mortal man inquire
5859,ARGUMENT,"To whom thy shameful loss of sight thou ow'st,"
5860,ARGUMENT,"Say, to Ulysses, city-waster Chief,"
5861,ARGUMENT,"Laertes' son, native of Ithaca."
5862,ARGUMENT,"I ceas'd, and with a groan thus he replied."
5863,ARGUMENT,Ah me! an antient oracle I feel
5864,ARGUMENT,"Accomplish'd. Here abode a prophet erst,                         600"
5865,ARGUMENT,"A man of noblest form, and in his art"
5866,ARGUMENT,"Unrivall'd, Telemus Eurymedes."
5867,ARGUMENT,"He, prophesying to the Cyclops-race,"
5868,ARGUMENT,"Grew old among us, and presaged my loss"
5869,ARGUMENT,"Of sight, in future, by Ulysses' hand."
5870,ARGUMENT,"I therefore watch'd for the arrival here,"
5871,ARGUMENT,"Always, of some great Chief, for stature, bulk"
5872,ARGUMENT,"And beauty prais'd, and cloath'd with wond'rous might."
5873,ARGUMENT,"But now--a dwarf, a thing impalpable,"
5874,ARGUMENT,"A shadow, overcame me first by wine,                             610"
5875,ARGUMENT,"Then quench'd my sight. Come hither, O my guest!"
5876,ARGUMENT,"Return, Ulysses! hospitable cheer"
5877,ARGUMENT,"Awaits thee, and my pray'rs I will prefer"
5878,ARGUMENT,To glorious Neptune for thy prosp'rous course;
5879,ARGUMENT,"For I am Neptune's offspring, and the God"
5880,ARGUMENT,"Is proud to be my Sire; he, if he please,"
5881,ARGUMENT,And he alone can heal me; none beside
5882,ARGUMENT,"Of Pow'rs immortal, or of men below."
5883,ARGUMENT,"He spake, to whom I answer thus return'd."
5884,ARGUMENT,"I would that of thy life and soul amerced,                       620"
5885,ARGUMENT,"I could as sure dismiss thee down to Hell,"
5886,ARGUMENT,As none shall heal thine eye--not even He.
5887,ARGUMENT,So I; then pray'd the Cyclops to his Sire
5888,ARGUMENT,With hands uprais'd towards the starry heav'n.
5889,ARGUMENT,"Hear, Earth-encircler Neptune, azure-hair'd!"
5890,ARGUMENT,"If I indeed am thine, and if thou boast"
5891,ARGUMENT,"Thyself my father, grant that never more"
5892,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, leveller of hostile tow'rs,"
5893,ARGUMENT,"Laertes' son, of Ithaca the fair,"
5894,ARGUMENT,Behold his native home! but if his fate                          630
5895,ARGUMENT,"Decree him yet to see his friends, his house,"
5896,ARGUMENT,"His native country, let him deep distress'd"
5897,ARGUMENT,"Return and late, all his companions lost,"
5898,ARGUMENT,"Indebted for a ship to foreign aid,"
5899,ARGUMENT,And let affliction meet him at his door.
5900,ARGUMENT,"He spake, and Ocean's sov'reign heard his pray'r."
5901,ARGUMENT,Then lifting from the shore a stone of size
5902,ARGUMENT,"Far more enormous, o'er his head he whirl'd"
5903,ARGUMENT,"The rock, and his immeasurable force"
5904,ARGUMENT,"Exerting all, dismiss'd it. Close behind                         640"
5905,ARGUMENT,"The ship, nor distant from the rudder's head,"
5906,ARGUMENT,Down came the mass. The ocean at the plunge
5907,ARGUMENT,"Of such a weight, high on its refluent flood"
5908,ARGUMENT,"Tumultuous, heaved the bark well nigh to land."
5909,ARGUMENT,But when we reach'd the isle where we had left
5910,ARGUMENT,"Our num'rous barks, and where my people sat"
5911,ARGUMENT,"Watching with ceaseless sorrow our return,"
5912,ARGUMENT,"We thrust our vessel to the sandy shore,"
5913,ARGUMENT,"Then disembark'd, and of the Cyclops' sheep"
5914,ARGUMENT,Gave equal share to all. To me alone                             650
5915,ARGUMENT,My fellow-voyagers the ram consign'd
5916,ARGUMENT,"In distribution, my peculiar meed."
5917,ARGUMENT,"Him, therefore, to cloud-girt Saturnian Jove"
5918,ARGUMENT,"I offer'd on the shore, burning his thighs"
5919,ARGUMENT,In sacrifice; but Jove my hallow'd rites
5920,ARGUMENT,"Reck'd not, destruction purposing to all"
5921,ARGUMENT,"My barks, and all my followers o'er the Deep."
5922,ARGUMENT,"Thus, feasting largely, on the shore we sat"
5923,ARGUMENT,"Till even-tide, and quaffing gen'rous wine;"
5924,ARGUMENT,"But when day fail'd, and night o'ershadow'd all,                 660"
5925,ARGUMENT,"Then, on the shore we slept; and when again"
5926,ARGUMENT,"Aurora rosy daughter of the Dawn,"
5927,ARGUMENT,"Look'd forth, my people, anxious, I enjoin'd"
5928,ARGUMENT,"To climb their barks, and cast the hawsers loose."
5929,ARGUMENT,"They all obedient, took their seats on board"
5930,ARGUMENT,"Well-ranged, and thresh'd with oars the foamy flood."
5931,ARGUMENT,"Thus, 'scaping narrowly, we roam'd the Deep"
5932,ARGUMENT,With aching hearts and with diminish'd crews.

6037,ARGUMENT,With empty hands. Now also he hath gain'd
6038,ARGUMENT,This pledge of friendship from the King of winds.
6039,ARGUMENT,"But come--be quick--search we the bag, and learn"
6040,ARGUMENT,What stores of gold and silver it contains.
6041,ARGUMENT,"So he, whose mischievous advice prevailed."
6042,ARGUMENT,"They loos'd the bag; forth issued all the winds,"
6043,ARGUMENT,"And, caught by tempests o'er the billowy waste,"
6044,ARGUMENT,"Weeping they flew, far, far from Ithaca."
6045,ARGUMENT,"I then, awaking, in my noble mind"
6046,ARGUMENT,"Stood doubtful, whether from my vessel's side                     60"
6047,ARGUMENT,"Immersed to perish in the flood, or calm"
6048,ARGUMENT,"To endure my sorrows, and content to live."
6049,ARGUMENT,I calm endured them; but around my head
6050,ARGUMENT,"Winding my mantle, lay'd me down below,"
6051,ARGUMENT,While adverse blasts bore all my fleet again
6052,ARGUMENT,To the Æolian isle; then groan'd my people.
6053,ARGUMENT,"We disembark'd and drew fresh water there,"
6054,ARGUMENT,"And my companions, at their galley's sides"
6055,ARGUMENT,"All seated, took repast; short meal we made,"
6056,ARGUMENT,"When, with an herald and a chosen friend,                         70"
6057,ARGUMENT,I sought once more the hall of Æolus.
6058,ARGUMENT,"Him banqueting with all his sons we found,"
6059,ARGUMENT,"And with his spouse; we ent'ring, on the floor"
6060,ARGUMENT,"Of his wide portal sat, whom they amazed"
6061,ARGUMENT,"Beheld, and of our coming thus enquired."
6062,ARGUMENT,Return'd? Ulysses! by what adverse Pow'r
6063,ARGUMENT,Repuls'd hast thou arrived? we sent thee hence
6064,ARGUMENT,"Well-fitted forth to reach thy native isle,"
6065,ARGUMENT,"Thy palace, or what place soe'er thou would'st."
6066,ARGUMENT,"So they--to whom, heart-broken, I replied.                      80"
6067,ARGUMENT,"My worthless crew have wrong'd me, nor alone"
6068,ARGUMENT,"My worthless crew, but sleep ill-timed, as much."
6069,ARGUMENT,"Yet heal, O friends, my hurt; the pow'r is yours!"
6070,ARGUMENT,"So I their favour woo'd. Mute sat the sons,"
6071,ARGUMENT,But thus their father answer'd. Hence--be gone--
6072,ARGUMENT,"Leave this our isle, thou most obnoxious wretch"
6073,ARGUMENT,"Of all mankind. I should, myself, transgress,"
6074,ARGUMENT,"Receiving here, and giving conduct hence"
6075,ARGUMENT,To one detested by the Gods as thou.
6076,ARGUMENT,Away--for hated by the Gods thou com'st.                          90
6077,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he sent me from his palace forth,"
6078,ARGUMENT,"Groaning profound; thence, therefore, o'er the Deep"
6079,ARGUMENT,"We still proceeded sorrowful, our force"
6080,ARGUMENT,"Exhausting ceaseless at the toilsome oar,"
6081,ARGUMENT,"And, through our own imprudence, hopeless now"
6082,ARGUMENT,Of other furth'rance to our native isle.
6083,ARGUMENT,"Six days we navigated, day and night,"
6084,ARGUMENT,"The briny flood, and on the seventh reach'd"
6085,ARGUMENT,"The city erst by Lamus built sublime,"
6086,ARGUMENT,"Proud Læstrygonia, with the distant gates.                       100"
6087,ARGUMENT,"The herdsman, there, driving his cattle home,[38]"
6088,ARGUMENT,Summons the shepherd with his flocks abroad.
6089,ARGUMENT,"The sleepless there might double wages earn,"
6090,ARGUMENT,"Attending, now, the herds, now, tending sheep,"
6091,ARGUMENT,"For the night-pastures, and the pastures grazed"
6092,ARGUMENT,"By day, close border, both, the city-walls."
6093,ARGUMENT,"To that illustrious port we came, by rocks"
6094,ARGUMENT,Uninterrupted flank'd on either side
6095,ARGUMENT,"Of tow'ring height, while prominent the shores"
6096,ARGUMENT,"And bold, converging at the haven's mouth                        110"
6097,ARGUMENT,"Leave narrow pass. We push'd our galleys in,"
6098,ARGUMENT,Then moor'd them side by side; for never surge
6099,ARGUMENT,"There lifts its head, or great or small, but clear"
6100,ARGUMENT,"We found, and motionless, the shelter'd flood."
6101,ARGUMENT,"Myself alone, staying my bark without,"
6102,ARGUMENT,Secured her well with hawsers to a rock
6103,ARGUMENT,"At the land's point, then climb'd the rugged steep,"
6104,ARGUMENT,And spying stood the country. Labours none
6105,ARGUMENT,"Of men or oxen in the land appear'd,"
6106,ARGUMENT,"Nor aught beside saw we, but from the earth                      120"
6107,ARGUMENT,Smoke rising; therefore of my friends I sent
6108,ARGUMENT,"Before me two, adding an herald third,"
6109,ARGUMENT,To learn what race of men that country fed.
6110,ARGUMENT,"Departing, they an even track pursued"
6111,ARGUMENT,Made by the waggons bringing timber down
6112,ARGUMENT,From the high mountains to the town below.
6113,ARGUMENT,Before the town a virgin bearing forth
6114,ARGUMENT,"Her ew'r they met, daughter of him who ruled"
6115,ARGUMENT,"The Læstrygonian race, Antiphatas."
6116,ARGUMENT,"Descending from the gate, she sought the fount                   130"
6117,ARGUMENT,Artacia; for their custom was to draw
6118,ARGUMENT,From that pure fountain for the city's use.
6119,ARGUMENT,"Approaching they accosted her, and ask'd"
6120,ARGUMENT,"What King reign'd there, and over whom he reign'd."
6121,ARGUMENT,She gave them soon to know where stood sublime
6122,ARGUMENT,The palace of her Sire; no sooner they
6123,ARGUMENT,"The palace enter'd, than within they found,"
6124,ARGUMENT,"In size resembling an huge mountain-top,"
6125,ARGUMENT,"A woman, whom they shudder'd to behold."
6126,ARGUMENT,She forth from council summon'd quick her spouse                 140
6127,ARGUMENT,"Antiphatas, who teeming came with thoughts"
6128,ARGUMENT,"Of carnage, and, arriving, seized at once"
6129,ARGUMENT,"A Greecian, whom, next moment, he devoured."
6130,ARGUMENT,With headlong terrour the surviving two
6131,ARGUMENT,Fled to the ships. Then sent Antiphatas
6132,ARGUMENT,"His voice through all the town, and on all sides,"
6133,ARGUMENT,"Hearing that cry, the Læstrygonians flock'd"
6134,ARGUMENT,"Numberless, and in size resembling more"
6135,ARGUMENT,The giants than mankind. They from the rocks
6136,ARGUMENT,"Cast down into our fleet enormous stones,                        150"
6137,ARGUMENT,A strong man's burthen each; dire din arose
6138,ARGUMENT,"Of shatter'd galleys and of dying men,"
6139,ARGUMENT,"Whom spear'd like fishes to their home they bore,"
6140,ARGUMENT,A loathsome prey. While them within the port
6141,ARGUMENT,"They slaughter'd, I, (the faulchion at my side"
6142,ARGUMENT,"Drawn forth) cut loose the hawser of my ship,"
6143,ARGUMENT,And all my crew enjoin'd with bosoms laid
6144,ARGUMENT,"Prone on their oars, to fly the threaten'd woe."
6145,ARGUMENT,"They, dreading instant death tugg'd resupine"
6146,ARGUMENT,"Together, and the galley from beneath                            160"
6147,ARGUMENT,Those beetling[39] rocks into the open sea
6148,ARGUMENT,Shot gladly; but the rest all perish'd there.
6149,ARGUMENT,"Proceeding thence, we sigh'd, and roamed the waves,"
6150,ARGUMENT,"Glad that we lived, but sorrowing for the slain."
6151,ARGUMENT,We came to the Ææan isle; there dwelt
6152,ARGUMENT,"The awful Circe, Goddess amber-hair'd,"
6153,ARGUMENT,"Deep-skill'd in magic song, sister by birth"
6154,ARGUMENT,"Of the all-wise Æætes; them the Sun,"
6155,ARGUMENT,"Bright luminary of the world, begat"
6156,ARGUMENT,"On Perse, daughter of Oceanus.                                   170"
6157,ARGUMENT,"Our vessel there, noiseless, we push'd to land"
6158,ARGUMENT,"Within a spacious haven, thither led"
6159,ARGUMENT,"By some celestial Pow'r. We disembark'd,"
6160,ARGUMENT,And on the coast two days and nights entire
6161,ARGUMENT,"Extended lay, worn with long toil, and each"
6162,ARGUMENT,The victim of his heart-devouring woes.
6163,ARGUMENT,"Then, with my spear and with my faulchion arm'd,"
6164,ARGUMENT,I left the ship to climb with hasty steps
6165,ARGUMENT,"An airy height, thence, hoping to espie"
6166,ARGUMENT,"Some works of man, or hear, perchance, a voice.                  180"
6167,ARGUMENT,Exalted on a rough rock's craggy point
6168,ARGUMENT,"I stood, and on the distant plain, beheld"
6169,ARGUMENT,Smoke which from Circe's palace through the gloom
6170,ARGUMENT,"Of trees and thickets rose. That smoke discern'd,"
6171,ARGUMENT,"I ponder'd next if thither I should haste,"
6172,ARGUMENT,"Seeking intelligence. Long time I mused,"
6173,ARGUMENT,"But chose at last, as my discreter course,"
6174,ARGUMENT,"To seek the sea-beach and my bark again,"
6175,ARGUMENT,"And, when my crew had eaten, to dispatch"
6176,ARGUMENT,"Before me, others, who should first enquire.                     190"
6177,ARGUMENT,"But, ere I yet had reach'd my gallant bark,"
6178,ARGUMENT,Some God with pity viewing me alone
6179,ARGUMENT,"In that untrodden solitude, sent forth"
6180,ARGUMENT,"An antler'd stag, full-sized, into my path."
6181,ARGUMENT,"His woodland pastures left, he sought the stream,"
6182,ARGUMENT,"For he was thirsty, and already parch'd"
6183,ARGUMENT,"By the sun's heat. Him issuing from his haunt,"
6184,ARGUMENT,"Sheer through the back beneath his middle spine,"
6185,ARGUMENT,"I wounded, and the lance sprang forth beyond."
6186,ARGUMENT,"Moaning he fell, and in the dust expired.                        200"
6187,ARGUMENT,"Then, treading on his breathless trunk, I pluck'd"
6188,ARGUMENT,"My weapon forth, which leaving there reclined,"
6189,ARGUMENT,I tore away the osiers with my hands
6190,ARGUMENT,"And fallows green, and to a fathom's length"
6191,ARGUMENT,"Twisting the gather'd twigs into a band,"
6192,ARGUMENT,"Bound fast the feet of my enormous prey,"
6193,ARGUMENT,"And, flinging him athwart my neck, repair'd"
6194,ARGUMENT,"Toward my sable bark, propp'd on my lance,"
6195,ARGUMENT,Which now to carry shoulder'd as before
6196,ARGUMENT,"Surpass'd my pow'r, so bulky was the load.                       210"
6197,ARGUMENT,"Arriving at the ship, there I let fall"
6198,ARGUMENT,"My burthen, and with pleasant speech and kind,"
6199,ARGUMENT,"Man after man addressing, cheer'd my crew."
6200,ARGUMENT,"My friends! we suffer much, but shall not seek"
6201,ARGUMENT,"The shades, ere yet our destined hour arrive."
6202,ARGUMENT,Behold a feast! and we have wine on board--
6203,ARGUMENT,Pine not with needless famine! rise and eat.
6204,ARGUMENT,"I spake; they readily obey'd, and each"
6205,ARGUMENT,"Issuing at my word abroad, beside"
6206,ARGUMENT,"The galley stood, admiring, as he lay,                           220"
6207,ARGUMENT,"The stag, for of no common bulk was he."
6208,ARGUMENT,"At length, their eyes gratified to the full"
6209,ARGUMENT,"With that glad spectacle, they laved their hands,"
6210,ARGUMENT,And preparation made of noble cheer.
6211,ARGUMENT,"That day complete, till set of sun, we spent"
6212,ARGUMENT,"Feasting deliciously without restraint,"
6213,ARGUMENT,And quaffing generous wine; but when the sun
6214,ARGUMENT,"Went down, and darkness overshadow'd all,"
6215,ARGUMENT,"Extended, then, on Ocean's bank we lay;"
6216,ARGUMENT,"And when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,                           230"
6217,ARGUMENT,"Look'd rosy forth, convening all my crew"
6218,ARGUMENT,"To council, I arose, and thus began."
6219,ARGUMENT,"My fellow-voyagers, however worn"
6220,ARGUMENT,"With num'rous hardships, hear! for neither West"
6221,ARGUMENT,"Know ye, nor East, where rises, or where sets"
6222,ARGUMENT,"The all-enlight'ning sun. But let us think,"
6223,ARGUMENT,"If thought perchance may profit us, of which"
6224,ARGUMENT,Small hope I see; for when I lately climb'd
6225,ARGUMENT,"Yon craggy rock, plainly I could discern"
6226,ARGUMENT,The land encompass'd by the boundless Deep.                      240
6227,ARGUMENT,"The isle is flat, and in the midst I saw"
6228,ARGUMENT,Dun smoke ascending from an oaken bow'r.
6229,ARGUMENT,"So I, whom hearing, they all courage lost,"
6230,ARGUMENT,And at remembrance of Antiphatas
6231,ARGUMENT,"The Læstrygonian, and the Cyclops' deeds,"
6232,ARGUMENT,"Ferocious feeder on the flesh of man,"
6233,ARGUMENT,"Mourn'd loud and wept, but tears could nought avail."
6234,ARGUMENT,"Then numb'ring man by man, I parted them"
6235,ARGUMENT,"In equal portions, and assign'd a Chief"
6236,ARGUMENT,"To either band, myself to these, to those                        250"
6237,ARGUMENT,"Godlike Eurylochus. This done, we cast"
6238,ARGUMENT,"The lots into the helmet, and at once"
6239,ARGUMENT,Forth sprang the lot of bold Eurylochus.
6240,ARGUMENT,"He went, and with him of my people march'd"
6241,ARGUMENT,"Twenty and two, all weeping; nor ourselves"
6242,ARGUMENT,"Wept less, at separation from our friends."
6243,ARGUMENT,"Low in a vale, but on an open spot,"
6244,ARGUMENT,"They found the splendid house of Circe, built"
6245,ARGUMENT,With hewn and polish'd stones; compass'd she dwelt
6246,ARGUMENT,By lions on all sides and mountain-wolves                        260
6247,ARGUMENT,Tamed by herself with drugs of noxious pow'rs.
6248,ARGUMENT,"Nor were they mischievous, but as my friends"
6249,ARGUMENT,"Approach'd, arising on their hinder feet,"
6250,ARGUMENT,"Paw'd them in blandishment, and wagg'd the tail."
6251,ARGUMENT,"As, when from feast he rises, dogs around"
6252,ARGUMENT,"Their master fawn, accustom'd to receive"
6253,ARGUMENT,"The sop conciliatory from his hand,"
6254,ARGUMENT,"Around my people, so, those talon'd wolves"
6255,ARGUMENT,"And lions fawn'd. They, terrified, that troop"
6256,ARGUMENT,Of savage monsters horrible beheld.                              270
6257,ARGUMENT,"And now, before the Goddess' gates arrived,"
6258,ARGUMENT,They heard the voice of Circe singing sweet
6259,ARGUMENT,"Within, while, busied at the loom, she wove"
6260,ARGUMENT,"An ample web immortal, such a work"
6261,ARGUMENT,"Transparent, graceful, and of bright design"
6262,ARGUMENT,As hands of Goddesses alone produce.
6263,ARGUMENT,"Thus then Polites, Prince of men, the friend"
6264,ARGUMENT,"Highest in my esteem, the rest bespake."
6265,ARGUMENT,"Ye hear the voice, comrades, of one who weaves"
6266,ARGUMENT,"An ample web within, and at her task                             280"
6267,ARGUMENT,So sweetly chaunts that all the marble floor
6268,ARGUMENT,Re-echoes; human be she or divine
6269,ARGUMENT,"I doubt, but let us call, that we may learn."
6270,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd; they call'd; soon issuing at the sound,"
6271,ARGUMENT,"The Goddess open'd wide her splendid gates,"
6272,ARGUMENT,"And bade them in; they, heedless, all complied,"
6273,ARGUMENT,"All save Eurylochus, who fear'd a snare."
6274,ARGUMENT,"She, introducing them, conducted each"
6275,ARGUMENT,"To a bright throne, then gave them Pramnian wine,"
6276,ARGUMENT,"With grated cheese, pure meal, and honey new,                    290"
6277,ARGUMENT,But medicated with her pois'nous drugs
6278,ARGUMENT,"Their food, that in oblivion they might lose"
6279,ARGUMENT,"The wish of home. She gave them, and they drank,--"
6280,ARGUMENT,"When, smiting each with her enchanting wand,"
6281,ARGUMENT,"She shut them in her sties. In head, in voice,"
6282,ARGUMENT,"In body, and in bristles they became"
6283,ARGUMENT,"All swine, yet intellected as before,"
6284,ARGUMENT,And at her hand were dieted alone
6285,ARGUMENT,"With acorns, chestnuts, and the cornel-fruit,"
6286,ARGUMENT,Food grateful ever to the grovelling swine.                      300
6287,ARGUMENT,"Back flew Eurylochus toward the ship,"
6288,ARGUMENT,"To tell the woeful tale; struggling to speak,"
6289,ARGUMENT,"Yet speechless, there he stood, his heart transfixt"
6290,ARGUMENT,"With anguish, and his eyes deluged with tears."
6291,ARGUMENT,"Me boding terrours occupied. At length,"
6292,ARGUMENT,"When, gazing on him, all had oft enquired,"
6293,ARGUMENT,He thus rehearsed to us the dreadful change.
6294,ARGUMENT,"Renown'd Ulysses! as thou bad'st, we went"
6295,ARGUMENT,"Through yonder oaks; there, bosom'd in a vale,"
6296,ARGUMENT,But built conspicuous on a swelling knoll                        310
6297,ARGUMENT,"With polish'd rock, we found a stately dome."
6298,ARGUMENT,"Within, some Goddess or some woman wove"
6299,ARGUMENT,"An ample web, carolling sweet the while."
6300,ARGUMENT,"They call'd aloud; she, issuing at the voice,"
6301,ARGUMENT,"Unfolded, soon, her splendid portals wide,"
6302,ARGUMENT,"And bade them in. Heedless they enter'd, all,"
6303,ARGUMENT,"But I remain'd, suspicious of a snare."
6304,ARGUMENT,"Ere long the whole band vanish'd, none I saw"
6305,ARGUMENT,"Thenceforth, though, seated there, long time I watch'd."
6306,ARGUMENT,He ended; I my studded faulchion huge                          320
6307,ARGUMENT,"Athwart my shoulder cast, and seized my bow,"
6308,ARGUMENT,Then bade him lead me thither by the way
6309,ARGUMENT,Himself had gone; but with both hands my knees
6310,ARGUMENT,"He clasp'd, and in wing'd accents sad exclaim'd."
6311,ARGUMENT,"My King! ah lead me not unwilling back,"
6312,ARGUMENT,But leave me here; for confident I judge
6313,ARGUMENT,"That neither thou wilt bring another thence,"
6314,ARGUMENT,Nor come thyself again. Haste--fly we swift
6315,ARGUMENT,"With these, for we, at least, may yet escape."
6316,ARGUMENT,"So he, to whom this answer I return'd.                         330"
6317,ARGUMENT,"Eurylochus! abiding here, eat thou"
6318,ARGUMENT,And drink thy fill beside the sable bark;
6319,ARGUMENT,I go; necessity forbids my stay.
6320,ARGUMENT,"So saying, I left the galley and the shore."
6321,ARGUMENT,"But ere that awful vale ent'ring, I reach'd"
6322,ARGUMENT,"The palace of the sorceress, a God"
6323,ARGUMENT,"Met me, the bearer of the golden wand,"
6324,ARGUMENT,"Hermes. He seem'd a stripling in his prime,"
6325,ARGUMENT,"His cheeks cloath'd only with their earliest down,"
6326,ARGUMENT,For youth is then most graceful; fast he lock'd                  340
6327,ARGUMENT,"His hand in mine, and thus, familiar, spake."
6328,ARGUMENT,"Unhappy! whither, wand'ring o'er the hills,"
6329,ARGUMENT,"Stranger to all this region, and alone,"
6330,ARGUMENT,Go'st thou? Thy people--they within the walls
6331,ARGUMENT,"Are shut of Circe, where as swine close-pent"
6332,ARGUMENT,She keeps them. Comest thou to set them free?
6333,ARGUMENT,"I tell thee, never wilt thou thence return"
6334,ARGUMENT,"Thyself, but wilt be prison'd with the rest."
6335,ARGUMENT,"Yet hearken--I will disappoint her wiles,"
6336,ARGUMENT,And will preserve thee. Take this precious drug;                 350
6337,ARGUMENT,"Possessing this, enter the Goddess' house"
6338,ARGUMENT,"Boldly, for it shall save thy life from harm."
6339,ARGUMENT,Lo! I reveal to thee the cruel arts
6340,ARGUMENT,Of Circe; learn them. She will mix for thee
6341,ARGUMENT,"A potion, and will also drug thy food"
6342,ARGUMENT,With noxious herbs; but she shall not prevail
6343,ARGUMENT,By all her pow'r to change thee; for the force
6344,ARGUMENT,"Superior of this noble plant, my gift,"
6345,ARGUMENT,Shall baffle her. Hear still what I advise.
6346,ARGUMENT,"When she shall smite thee with her slender rod,                  360"
6347,ARGUMENT,With faulchion drawn and with death-threat'ning looks
6348,ARGUMENT,Rush on her; she will bid thee to her bed
6349,ARGUMENT,Affrighted; then beware. Decline not thou
6350,ARGUMENT,"Her love, that she may both release thy friends,"
6351,ARGUMENT,And may with kindness entertain thyself.
6352,ARGUMENT,But force her swear the dreaded oath of heav'n
6353,ARGUMENT,That she will other mischief none devise
6354,ARGUMENT,"Against thee, lest she strip thee of thy might,"
6355,ARGUMENT,"And, quenching all thy virtue, make thee vile."
6356,ARGUMENT,"So spake the Argicide, and from the earth                      370"
6357,ARGUMENT,"That plant extracting, placed it in my hand,"
6358,ARGUMENT,"Then taught me all its pow'rs. Black was the root,"
6359,ARGUMENT,Milk-white the blossom; Moly is its name
6360,ARGUMENT,In heav'n; not easily by mortal man
6361,ARGUMENT,"Dug forth, but all is easy to the Gods."
6362,ARGUMENT,"Then, Hermes through the island-woods repair'd"
6363,ARGUMENT,"To heav'n, and I to Circe's dread abode,"
6364,ARGUMENT,In gloomy musings busied as I went.
6365,ARGUMENT,"Within the vestibule arrived, where dwelt"
6366,ARGUMENT,"The beauteous Goddess, staying there my steps,                   380"
6367,ARGUMENT,"I call'd aloud; she heard me, and at once"
6368,ARGUMENT,"Issuing, threw her splendid portals wide,"
6369,ARGUMENT,"And bade me in. I follow'd, heart-distress'd."
6370,ARGUMENT,Leading me by the hand to a bright throne
6371,ARGUMENT,"With argent studs embellish'd, and beneath"
6372,ARGUMENT,"Footstool'd magnificent, she made me sit."
6373,ARGUMENT,Then mingling for me in a golden cup
6374,ARGUMENT,"My bev'rage, she infused a drug, intent"
6375,ARGUMENT,On mischief; but when I had drunk the draught
6376,ARGUMENT,"Unchanged, she smote me with her wand, and said.                 390"
6377,ARGUMENT,Hence--seek the sty. There wallow with thy friends.
6378,ARGUMENT,She spake; I drawing from beside my thigh
6379,ARGUMENT,"My faulchion keen, with death-denouncing looks"
6380,ARGUMENT,Rush'd on her; she with a shrill scream of fear
6381,ARGUMENT,"Ran under my rais'd arm, seized fast my knees,"
6382,ARGUMENT,And in wing'd accents plaintive thus began.
6383,ARGUMENT,Who? whence? thy city and thy birth declare.
6384,ARGUMENT,"Amazed I see thee with that potion drench'd,"
6385,ARGUMENT,Yet uninchanted; never man before
6386,ARGUMENT,"Once pass'd it through his lips, and liv'd the same;             400"
6387,ARGUMENT,"But in thy breast a mind inhabits, proof"
6388,ARGUMENT,Against all charms. Come then--I know thee well.
6389,ARGUMENT,"Thou art Ulysses artifice-renown'd,"
6390,ARGUMENT,Of whose arrival here in his return
6391,ARGUMENT,"From Ilium, Hermes of the golden wand"
6392,ARGUMENT,Was ever wont to tell me. Sheath again
6393,ARGUMENT,"Thy sword, and let us, on my bed reclined,"
6394,ARGUMENT,"Mutual embrace, that we may trust thenceforth"
6395,ARGUMENT,"Each other, without jealousy or fear."
6396,ARGUMENT,"The Goddess spake, to whom I thus replied.                     410"
6397,ARGUMENT,O Circe! canst thou bid me meek become
6398,ARGUMENT,"And gentle, who beneath thy roof detain'st"
6399,ARGUMENT,My fellow-voyagers transform'd to swine?
6400,ARGUMENT,"And, fearing my escape, invit'st thou me"
6401,ARGUMENT,"Into thy bed, with fraudulent pretext"
6402,ARGUMENT,"Of love, that there, enfeebling by thy arts"
6403,ARGUMENT,"My noble spirit, thou may'st make me vile?"
6404,ARGUMENT,No--trust me--never will I share thy bed
6405,ARGUMENT,"Till first, O Goddess, thou consent to swear"
6406,ARGUMENT,"The dread all-binding oath, that other harm                      420"
6407,ARGUMENT,Against myself thou wilt imagine none.
6408,ARGUMENT,"I spake. She swearing as I bade, renounced"
6409,ARGUMENT,"All evil purpose, and (her solemn oath"
6410,ARGUMENT,"Concluded) I ascended, next, her bed"
6411,ARGUMENT,"Magnificent. Meantime, four graceful nymphs"
6412,ARGUMENT,"Attended on the service of the house,"
6413,ARGUMENT,"Her menials, from the fountains sprung and groves,"
6414,ARGUMENT,And from the sacred streams that seek the sea.
6415,ARGUMENT,"Of these, one cast fine linen on the thrones,"
6416,ARGUMENT,"Which, next, with purple arras rich she spread;                  430"
6417,ARGUMENT,Another placed before the gorgeous seats
6418,ARGUMENT,"Bright tables, and set on baskets of gold."
6419,ARGUMENT,"The third, an argent beaker fill'd with wine"
6420,ARGUMENT,"Delicious, which in golden cups she served;"
6421,ARGUMENT,"The fourth brought water, which she warm'd within"
6422,ARGUMENT,"An ample vase, and when the simm'ring flood"
6423,ARGUMENT,"Sang in the tripod, led me to a bath,"
6424,ARGUMENT,And laved me with the pleasant stream profuse
6425,ARGUMENT,"Pour'd o'er my neck and body, till my limbs"
6426,ARGUMENT,"Refresh'd, all sense of lassitude resign'd.                      440"
6427,ARGUMENT,"When she had bathed me, and with limpid oil"
6428,ARGUMENT,"Anointed me, and cloathed me in a vest"
6429,ARGUMENT,"And mantle, next, she led me to a throne"
6430,ARGUMENT,"Of royal state, with silver studs emboss'd,"
6431,ARGUMENT,And footstool'd soft beneath; then came a nymph
6432,ARGUMENT,"With golden ewer charged and silver bowl,"
6433,ARGUMENT,"Who pour'd pure water on my hands, and placed"
6434,ARGUMENT,"The polish'd board before me, which with food"
6435,ARGUMENT,"Various, selected from her present stores,"
6436,ARGUMENT,"The cat'ress spread, then, courteous, bade me eat.               450"
6437,ARGUMENT,But me it pleas'd not; with far other thoughts
6438,ARGUMENT,"My spirit teem'd, on vengeance more intent."
6439,ARGUMENT,"Soon, then, as Circe mark'd me on my seat"
6440,ARGUMENT,"Fast-rooted, sullen, nor with outstretch'd hands"
6441,ARGUMENT,"Deigning to touch the banquet, she approach'd,"
6442,ARGUMENT,And in wing'd accents suasive thus began.
6443,ARGUMENT,"Why sits Ulysses like the Dumb, dark thoughts"
6444,ARGUMENT,"His only food? loaths he the touch of meat,"
6445,ARGUMENT,"And taste of wine? Thou fear'st, as I perceive,"
6446,ARGUMENT,"Some other snare, but idle is that fear,                         460"
6447,ARGUMENT,For I have sworn the inviolable oath.
6448,ARGUMENT,"She ceas'd, to whom this answer I return'd."
6449,ARGUMENT,"How can I eat? what virtuous man and just,"
6450,ARGUMENT,O Circe! could endure the taste of wine
6451,ARGUMENT,"Or food, till he should see his prison'd friends"
6452,ARGUMENT,Once more at liberty? If then thy wish
6453,ARGUMENT,"That I should eat and drink be true, produce"
6454,ARGUMENT,My captive people; let us meet again.
6455,ARGUMENT,"So I; then Circe, bearing in her hand"
6456,ARGUMENT,"Her potent rod, went forth, and op'ning wide                     470"
6457,ARGUMENT,"The door, drove out my people from the sty,"
6458,ARGUMENT,In bulk resembling brawns of the ninth year.
6459,ARGUMENT,They stood before me; she through all the herd
6460,ARGUMENT,"Proceeding, with an unctuous antidote"
6461,ARGUMENT,"Anointed each, and at the wholesome touch"
6462,ARGUMENT,All shed the swinish bristles by the drug
6463,ARGUMENT,"Dread Circe's former magic gift, produced."
6464,ARGUMENT,"Restored at once to manhood, they appear'd"
6465,ARGUMENT,"More vig'rous far, and sightlier than before."
6466,ARGUMENT,"They knew me, and with grasp affectionate                        480"
6467,ARGUMENT,"Hung on my hand. Tears follow'd, but of joy,"
6468,ARGUMENT,And with loud cries the vaulted palace rang.
6469,ARGUMENT,"Even the awful Goddess felt, herself,"
6470,ARGUMENT,"Compassion, and, approaching me, began."
6471,ARGUMENT,"Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!"
6472,ARGUMENT,"Hence to the shore, and to thy gallant bark;"
6473,ARGUMENT,"First, hale her safe aground, then, hiding all"
6474,ARGUMENT,"Your arms and treasures in the caverns, come"
6475,ARGUMENT,"Thyself again, and hither lead thy friends."
6476,ARGUMENT,"So spake the Goddess, and my gen'rous mind                       490"
6477,ARGUMENT,"Persuaded; thence repairing to the beach,"
6478,ARGUMENT,"I sought my ship; arrived, I found my crew"
6479,ARGUMENT,"Lamenting miserably, and their cheeks"
6480,ARGUMENT,With tears bedewing ceaseless at her side.
6481,ARGUMENT,As when the calves within some village rear'd
6482,ARGUMENT,"Behold, at eve, the herd returning home"
6483,ARGUMENT,"From fruitful meads where they have grazed their fill,"
6484,ARGUMENT,"No longer in the stalls contain'd, they rush"
6485,ARGUMENT,"With many a frisk abroad, and, blaring oft,"
6486,ARGUMENT,"With one consent, all dance their dams around,                   500"
6487,ARGUMENT,"So they, at sight of me, dissolved in tears"
6488,ARGUMENT,"Of rapt'rous joy, and each his spirit felt"
6489,ARGUMENT,With like affections warm'd as he had reach'd
6490,ARGUMENT,"Just then his country, and his city seen,"
6491,ARGUMENT,"Fair Ithaca, where he was born and rear'd."
6492,ARGUMENT,Then in wing'd accents tender thus they spake.
6493,ARGUMENT,Noble Ulysses! thy appearance fills
6494,ARGUMENT,"Our soul with transports, such as we should feel"
6495,ARGUMENT,Arrived in safety on our native shore.
6496,ARGUMENT,Speak--say how perish'd our unhappy friends?                     510
6497,ARGUMENT,So they; to whom this answer mild I gave.
6498,ARGUMENT,"Hale we our vessel first ashore, and hide"
6499,ARGUMENT,"In caverns all our treasures and our arms,"
6500,ARGUMENT,"Then, hasting hence, follow me, and ere long"
6501,ARGUMENT,"Ye shall behold your friends, beneath the roof"
6502,ARGUMENT,Of Circe banqueting and drinking wine
6503,ARGUMENT,"Abundant, for no dearth attends them there."
6504,ARGUMENT,"So I; whom all with readiness obey'd,"
6505,ARGUMENT,All save Eurylochus; he sought alone
6506,ARGUMENT,"To stay the rest, and, eager, interposed.                        520"
6507,ARGUMENT,"Ah whither tend we, miserable men?"
6508,ARGUMENT,"Why covet ye this evil, to go down"
6509,ARGUMENT,To Circe's palace? she will change us all
6510,ARGUMENT,"To lions, wolves or swine, that we may guard"
6511,ARGUMENT,"Her palace, by necessity constrain'd."
6512,ARGUMENT,"So some were pris'ners of the Cyclops erst,"
6513,ARGUMENT,"When, led by rash Ulysses, our lost friends"
6514,ARGUMENT,"Intruded needlessly into his cave,"
6515,ARGUMENT,And perish'd by the folly of their Chief.
6516,ARGUMENT,"He spake, whom hearing, occupied I stood                       530"
6517,ARGUMENT,"In self-debate, whether, my faulchion keen"
6518,ARGUMENT,"Forth-drawing from beside my sturdy thigh,"
6519,ARGUMENT,"To tumble his lopp'd head into the dust,"
6520,ARGUMENT,Although he were my kinsman in the bonds
6521,ARGUMENT,Of close affinity; but all my friends
6522,ARGUMENT,"As with one voice, thus gently interposed."
6523,ARGUMENT,Noble Ulysses! we will leave him here
6524,ARGUMENT,"Our vessel's guard, if such be thy command,"
6525,ARGUMENT,But us lead thou to Circe's dread abode.
6526,ARGUMENT,"So saying, they left the galley, and set forth                 540"
6527,ARGUMENT,Climbing the coast; nor would Eurylochus
6528,ARGUMENT,"Beside the hollow bark remain, but join'd"
6529,ARGUMENT,His comrades by my dreadful menace awed.
6530,ARGUMENT,"Meantime the Goddess, busily employ'd,"
6531,ARGUMENT,"Bathed and refresh'd my friends with limpid oil,"
6532,ARGUMENT,"And clothed them. We, arriving, found them all"
6533,ARGUMENT,Banqueting in the palace; there they met;
6534,ARGUMENT,"These ask'd, and those rehearsed the wond'rous tale,"
6535,ARGUMENT,"And, the recital made, all wept aloud"
6536,ARGUMENT,Till the wide dome resounded. Then approach'd                    550
6537,ARGUMENT,"The graceful Goddess, and address'd me thus."
6538,ARGUMENT,"Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!"
6539,ARGUMENT,"Provoke ye not each other, now, to tears."
6540,ARGUMENT,"I am not ignorant, myself, how dread"
6541,ARGUMENT,"Have been your woes both on the fishy Deep,"
6542,ARGUMENT,And on the land by force of hostile pow'rs.
6543,ARGUMENT,"But come--Eat now, and drink ye wine, that so"
6544,ARGUMENT,"Your freshen'd spirit may revive, and ye"
6545,ARGUMENT,"Courageous grow again, as when ye left"
6546,ARGUMENT,"The rugged shores of Ithaca, your home.                          560"
6547,ARGUMENT,"For now, through recollection, day by day,"
6548,ARGUMENT,"Of all your pains and toils, ye are become"
6549,ARGUMENT,"Spiritless, strengthless, and the taste forget"
6550,ARGUMENT,"Of pleasure, such have been your num'rous woes."
6551,ARGUMENT,"She spake, whose invitation kind prevail'd,"
6552,ARGUMENT,"And won us to her will. There, then, we dwelt"
6553,ARGUMENT,"The year complete, fed with delicious fare"
6554,ARGUMENT,"Day after day, and quaffing gen'rous wine."
6555,ARGUMENT,But when (the year fulfill'd) the circling hours
6556,ARGUMENT,"Their course resumed, and the successive months                  570"
6557,ARGUMENT,"With all their tedious days were spent, my friends,"
6558,ARGUMENT,"Summoning me abroad, thus greeted me."
6559,ARGUMENT,"Sir! recollect thy country, if indeed"
6560,ARGUMENT,The fates ordain thee to revisit safe
6561,ARGUMENT,"That country, and thy own glorious abode."
6562,ARGUMENT,So they; whose admonition I receiv'd
6563,ARGUMENT,"Well-pleas'd. Then, all the day, regaled we sat"
6564,ARGUMENT,"At Circe's board with sav'ry viands rare,"
6565,ARGUMENT,"And quaffing richest wine; but when, the sun"
6566,ARGUMENT,"Declining, darkness overshadow'd all,                            580"
6567,ARGUMENT,"Then, each within the dusky palace took"
6568,ARGUMENT,"Custom'd repose, and to the Goddess' bed"
6569,ARGUMENT,"Magnificent ascending, there I urged"
6570,ARGUMENT,"My earnest suit, which gracious she receiv'd,"
6571,ARGUMENT,And in wing'd accents earnest thus I spake.
6572,ARGUMENT,O Circe! let us prove thy promise true;
6573,ARGUMENT,"Dismiss us hence. My own desires, at length,"
6574,ARGUMENT,"Tend homeward vehement, and the desires"
6575,ARGUMENT,"No less of all my friends, who with complaints"
6576,ARGUMENT,"Unheard by thee, wear my sad heart away.                         590"
6577,ARGUMENT,So I; to whom the Goddess in return.
6578,ARGUMENT,"Laertes' noble son, Ulysses famed"
6579,ARGUMENT,"For deepest wisdom! dwell not longer here,"
6580,ARGUMENT,"Thou and thy followers, in my abode"
6581,ARGUMENT,Reluctant; but your next must be a course
6582,ARGUMENT,"Far diff'rent; hence departing, ye must seek"
6583,ARGUMENT,The dreary house of Ades and of dread
6584,ARGUMENT,Persephone there to consult the Seer
6585,ARGUMENT,"Theban Tiresias, prophet blind, but blest"
6586,ARGUMENT,With faculties which death itself hath spared.                   600
6587,ARGUMENT,"To him alone, of all the dead, Hell's Queen"
6588,ARGUMENT,"Gives still to prophesy, while others flit"
6589,ARGUMENT,"Mere forms, the shadows of what once they were."
6590,ARGUMENT,"She spake, and by her words dash'd from my soul"
6591,ARGUMENT,"All courage; weeping on the bed I sat,"
6592,ARGUMENT,Reckless of life and of the light of day.
6593,ARGUMENT,"But when, with tears and rolling to and fro"
6594,ARGUMENT,"Satiate, I felt relief, thus I replied."
6595,ARGUMENT,O Circe! with what guide shall I perform
6596,ARGUMENT,"This voyage, unperform'd by living man?                          610"
6597,ARGUMENT,"I spake, to whom the Goddess quick replied."
6598,ARGUMENT,Brave Laertiades! let not the fear
6599,ARGUMENT,"To want a guide distress thee. Once on board,"
6600,ARGUMENT,"Your mast erected, and your canvas white"
6601,ARGUMENT,"Unfurl'd, sit thou; the breathing North shall waft"
6602,ARGUMENT,Thy vessel on. But when ye shall have cross'd
6603,ARGUMENT,"The broad expanse of Ocean, and shall reach"
6604,ARGUMENT,"The oozy shore, where grow the poplar groves"
6605,ARGUMENT,"And fruitless willows wan of Proserpine,"
6606,ARGUMENT,"Push thither through the gulphy Deep thy bark,                   620"
6607,ARGUMENT,"And, landing, haste to Pluto's murky abode."
6608,ARGUMENT,"There, into Acheron runs not alone"
6609,ARGUMENT,"Dread Pyriphlegethon, but Cocytus loud,"
6610,ARGUMENT,"From Styx derived; there also stands a rock,"
6611,ARGUMENT,At whose broad base the roaring rivers meet.
6612,ARGUMENT,"There, thrusting, as I bid, thy bark ashore,"
6613,ARGUMENT,"O Hero! scoop the soil, op'ning a trench"
6614,ARGUMENT,Ell-broad on ev'ry side; then pour around
6615,ARGUMENT,"Libation consecrate to all the dead,"
6616,ARGUMENT,"First, milk with honey mixt, then luscious wine,                 630"
6617,ARGUMENT,"Then water, sprinkling, last, meal over all."
6618,ARGUMENT,"Next, supplicate the unsubstantial forms"
6619,ARGUMENT,"Fervently of the dead, vowing to slay,"
6620,ARGUMENT,"(Return'd to Ithaca) in thy own house,"
6621,ARGUMENT,"An heifer barren yet, fairest and best"
6622,ARGUMENT,"Of all thy herds, and to enrich the pile"
6623,ARGUMENT,With delicacies such as please the shades;
6624,ARGUMENT,"But, in peculiar, to Tiresias vow"
6625,ARGUMENT,"A sable ram, noblest of all thy flocks."
6626,ARGUMENT,When thus thou hast propitiated with pray'r                      640
6627,ARGUMENT,"All the illustrious nations of the dead,"
6628,ARGUMENT,"Next, thou shalt sacrifice to them a ram"
6629,ARGUMENT,"And sable ewe, turning the face of each"
6630,ARGUMENT,"Right toward Erebus, and look thyself,"
6631,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, askance toward the river's course."
6632,ARGUMENT,"Souls num'rous, soon, of the departed dead"
6633,ARGUMENT,"Will thither flock; then, strenuous urge thy friends,"
6634,ARGUMENT,Flaying the victims which thy ruthless steel
6635,ARGUMENT,"Hath slain, to burn them, and to sooth by pray'r"
6636,ARGUMENT,Illustrious Pluto and dread Proserpine.                          650
6637,ARGUMENT,"While thus is done, thou seated at the foss,"
6638,ARGUMENT,"Faulchion in hand, chace thence the airy forms"
6639,ARGUMENT,"Afar, nor suffer them to approach the blood,"
6640,ARGUMENT,Till with Tiresias thou have first conferr'd.
6641,ARGUMENT,"Then, glorious Chief! the Prophet shall himself"
6642,ARGUMENT,"Appear, who will instruct thee, and thy course"
6643,ARGUMENT,"Delineate, measuring from place to place"
6644,ARGUMENT,Thy whole return athwart the fishy flood.
6645,ARGUMENT,"While thus she spake, the golden dawn arose,"
6646,ARGUMENT,"When, putting on me my attire, the nymph                         660"
6647,ARGUMENT,"Next, cloath'd herself, and girding to her waist"
6648,ARGUMENT,With an embroider'd zone her snowy robe
6649,ARGUMENT,"Graceful, redundant, veil'd her beauteous head."
6650,ARGUMENT,"Then, ranging the wide palace, I aroused"
6651,ARGUMENT,"My followers, standing at the side of each--"
6652,ARGUMENT,"Up! sleep no longer! let us quick depart,"
6653,ARGUMENT,"For thus the Goddess hath, herself, advised."
6654,ARGUMENT,"So I, whose early summons my brave friends"
6655,ARGUMENT,With readiness obey'd. Yet even thence
6656,ARGUMENT,"I brought not all my crew. There was a youth,                    670"
6657,ARGUMENT,"Youngest of all my train, Elpenor; one"
6658,ARGUMENT,Not much in estimation for desert
6659,ARGUMENT,"In arms, nor prompt in understanding more,"
6660,ARGUMENT,"Who overcharged with wine, and covetous"
6661,ARGUMENT,"Of cooler air, high on the palace-roof"
6662,ARGUMENT,"Of Circe slept, apart from all the rest."
6663,ARGUMENT,Awaken'd by the clamour of his friends
6664,ARGUMENT,"Newly arisen, he also sprang to rise,"
6665,ARGUMENT,"And in his haste, forgetful where to find"
6666,ARGUMENT,"The deep-descending stairs, plunged through the roof.            680"
6667,ARGUMENT,With neck-bone broken from the vertebræ
6668,ARGUMENT,Outstretch'd he lay; his spirit sought the shades.
6669,ARGUMENT,"Then, thus to my assembling friends I spake."
6670,ARGUMENT,"Ye think, I doubt not, of an homeward course,"
6671,ARGUMENT,But Circe points me to the drear abode
6672,ARGUMENT,"Of Proserpine and Pluto, to consult"
6673,ARGUMENT,"The spirit of Tiresias, Theban seer."
6674,ARGUMENT,"I ended, and the hearts of all alike"
6675,ARGUMENT,Felt consternation; on the earth they sat
6676,ARGUMENT,"Disconsolate, and plucking each his hair,                        690"
6677,ARGUMENT,Yet profit none of all their sorrow found.
6678,ARGUMENT,But while we sought my galley on the beach
6679,ARGUMENT,"With tepid tears bedewing, as we went,"
6680,ARGUMENT,"Our cheeks, meantime the Goddess to the shore"
6681,ARGUMENT,"Descending, bound within the bark a ram"
6682,ARGUMENT,"And sable ewe, passing us unperceived."
6683,ARGUMENT,For who hath eyes that can discern a God
6684,ARGUMENT,"Going or coming, if he shun the view?"

6738,ARGUMENT,"First, milk with honey mixt, then luscious wine,"
6739,ARGUMENT,"Then water, sprinkling, last, meal over all.                      30"
6740,ARGUMENT,"This done, adoring the unreal forms"
6741,ARGUMENT,"And shadows of the dead, I vow'd to slay,"
6742,ARGUMENT,"(Return'd to Ithaca) in my own abode,"
6743,ARGUMENT,"An heifer barren yet, fairest and best"
6744,ARGUMENT,"Of all my herds, and to enrich the pile"
6745,ARGUMENT,"With delicacies, such as please the shades."
6746,ARGUMENT,"But, in peculiar, to the Theban seer"
6747,ARGUMENT,"I vow'd a sable ram, largest and best"
6748,ARGUMENT,Of all my flocks. When thus I had implored
6749,ARGUMENT,"With vows and pray'r, the nations of the dead,                    40"
6750,ARGUMENT,"Piercing the victims next, I turn'd them both"
6751,ARGUMENT,To bleed into the trench; then swarming came
6752,ARGUMENT,"From Erebus the shades of the deceased,"
6753,ARGUMENT,"Brides, youths unwedded, seniors long with woe"
6754,ARGUMENT,"Oppress'd, and tender girls yet new to grief."
6755,ARGUMENT,Came also many a warrior by the spear
6756,ARGUMENT,"In battle pierced, with armour gore-distain'd,"
6757,ARGUMENT,And all the multitude around the foss
6758,ARGUMENT,Stalk'd shrieking dreadful; me pale horror seized.
6759,ARGUMENT,"I next, importunate, my people urged,                             50"
6760,ARGUMENT,"Flaying the victims which myself had slain,"
6761,ARGUMENT,"To burn them, and to supplicate in pray'r"
6762,ARGUMENT,Illustrious Pluto and dread Proserpine.
6763,ARGUMENT,"Then down I sat, and with drawn faulchion chased"
6764,ARGUMENT,"The ghosts, nor suffer'd them to approach the blood,"
6765,ARGUMENT,Till with Tiresias I should first confer.
6766,ARGUMENT,"The spirit, first, of my companion came,"
6767,ARGUMENT,Elpenor; for no burial honours yet
6768,ARGUMENT,"Had he received, but we had left his corse"
6769,ARGUMENT,"In Circe's palace, tombless, undeplored,                          60"
6770,ARGUMENT,Ourselves by pressure urged of other cares.
6771,ARGUMENT,"Touch'd with compassion seeing him, I wept,"
6772,ARGUMENT,And in wing'd accents brief him thus bespake.
6773,ARGUMENT,Elpenor! how cam'st thou into the realms
6774,ARGUMENT,"Of darkness? Hast thou, though on foot, so far"
6775,ARGUMENT,"Outstripp'd my speed, who in my bark arrived?"
6776,ARGUMENT,"So I, to whom with tears he thus replied."
6777,ARGUMENT,"Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!"
6778,ARGUMENT,"Fool'd by some dæmon and the intemp'rate bowl,"
6779,ARGUMENT,I perish'd in the house of Circe; there                           70
6780,ARGUMENT,"The deep-descending steps heedless I miss'd,"
6781,ARGUMENT,And fell precipitated from the roof.
6782,ARGUMENT,With neck-bone broken from the vertebræ
6783,ARGUMENT,Outstretch'd I lay; my spirit sought the shades.
6784,ARGUMENT,"But now, by those whom thou hast left at home,"
6785,ARGUMENT,"By thy Penelope, and by thy fire,"
6786,ARGUMENT,"The gentle nourisher of thy infant growth,"
6787,ARGUMENT,And by thy only son Telemachus
6788,ARGUMENT,"I make my suit to thee. For, sure, I know"
6789,ARGUMENT,"That from the house of Pluto safe return'd,                       80"
6790,ARGUMENT,Thou shalt ere long thy gallant vessel moor
6791,ARGUMENT,At the Ææan isle. Ah! there arrived
6792,ARGUMENT,Remember me. Leave me not undeplored
6793,ARGUMENT,"Nor uninhumed, lest, for my sake, the Gods"
6794,ARGUMENT,In vengeance visit thee; but with my arms
6795,ARGUMENT,"(What arms soe'er I left) burn me, and raise"
6796,ARGUMENT,"A kind memorial of me on the coast,"
6797,ARGUMENT,Heap'd high with earth; that an unhappy man
6798,ARGUMENT,May yet enjoy an unforgotten name.
6799,ARGUMENT,"Thus do at my request, and on my hill                             90"
6800,ARGUMENT,"Funereal, plant the oar with which I row'd,"
6801,ARGUMENT,While yet I lived a mariner of thine.
6802,ARGUMENT,"He spake, to whom thus answer I return'd."
6803,ARGUMENT,Poor youth! I will perform thy whole desire.
6804,ARGUMENT,"Thus we, there sitting, doleful converse held,"
6805,ARGUMENT,"With outstretch'd faulchion, I, guarding the blood,"
6806,ARGUMENT,And my companion's shadowy semblance sad
6807,ARGUMENT,Meantime discoursing me on various themes.
6808,ARGUMENT,"The soul of my departed mother, next,"
6809,ARGUMENT,"Of Anticleia came, daughter of brave                             100"
6810,ARGUMENT,"Autolycus; whom, when I sought the shores"
6811,ARGUMENT,"Of Ilium, I had living left at home."
6812,ARGUMENT,"Seeing her, with compassion touch'd, I wept,"
6813,ARGUMENT,"Yet even her, (although it pain'd my soul)"
6814,ARGUMENT,"Forbad, relentless, to approach the blood,"
6815,ARGUMENT,Till with Tiresias I should first confer.
6816,ARGUMENT,Then came the spirit of the Theban seer
6817,ARGUMENT,"Himself, his golden sceptre in his hand,"
6818,ARGUMENT,"Who knew me, and, enquiring, thus began."
6819,ARGUMENT,"Why, hapless Chief! leaving the cheerful day,                  110"
6820,ARGUMENT,"Arriv'st thou to behold the dead, and this"
6821,ARGUMENT,"Unpleasant land? but, from the trench awhile"
6822,ARGUMENT,"Receding, turn thy faulchion keen away,"
6823,ARGUMENT,"That I may drink the blood, and tell thee truth."
6824,ARGUMENT,"He spake; I thence receding, deep infix'd"
6825,ARGUMENT,My sword bright-studded in the sheath again.
6826,ARGUMENT,"The noble prophet then, approaching, drank"
6827,ARGUMENT,"The blood, and, satisfied, address'd me thus."
6828,ARGUMENT,"Thou seek'st a pleasant voyage home again,"
6829,ARGUMENT,Renown'd Ulysses! but a God will make                            120
6830,ARGUMENT,"That voyage difficult; for, as I judge,"
6831,ARGUMENT,"Thou wilt not pass by Neptune unperceiv'd,"
6832,ARGUMENT,"Whose anger follows thee, for that thou hast"
6833,ARGUMENT,Deprived his son Cyclops of his eye.
6834,ARGUMENT,"At length, however, after num'rous woes"
6835,ARGUMENT,"Endur'd, thou may'st attain thy native isle,"
6836,ARGUMENT,If thy own appetite thou wilt controul
6837,ARGUMENT,"And theirs who follow thee, what time thy bark"
6838,ARGUMENT,"Well-built, shall at Thrinacia's shore arrive,[41]"
6839,ARGUMENT,Escaped from perils of the gloomy Deep.                          130
6840,ARGUMENT,There shall ye find grazing the flocks and herds
6841,ARGUMENT,"Of the all-seeing and all-hearing Sun,"
6842,ARGUMENT,"Which, if attentive to thy safe return,"
6843,ARGUMENT,"Thou leave unharm'd, though after num'rous woes,"
6844,ARGUMENT,Ye may at length arrive in Ithaca.
6845,ARGUMENT,"But if thou violate them, I denounce"
6846,ARGUMENT,"Destruction on thy ship and all thy band,"
6847,ARGUMENT,"And though thyself escape, late shalt thou reach"
6848,ARGUMENT,"Thy home and hard-bested,[42] in a strange bark,"
6849,ARGUMENT,All thy companions lost; trouble beside                          140
6850,ARGUMENT,"Awaits thee there, for thou shalt find within"
6851,ARGUMENT,"Proud suitors of thy noble wife, who waste"
6852,ARGUMENT,"Thy substance, and with promis'd spousal gifts"
6853,ARGUMENT,Ceaseless solicit her to wed; yet well
6854,ARGUMENT,Shalt thou avenge all their injurious deeds.
6855,ARGUMENT,"That once perform'd, and ev'ry suitor slain"
6856,ARGUMENT,"Either by stratagem, or face to face,"
6857,ARGUMENT,"In thy own palace, bearing, as thou go'st,"
6858,ARGUMENT,"A shapely oar, journey, till thou hast found"
6859,ARGUMENT,"A people who the sea know not, nor eat                           150"
6860,ARGUMENT,Food salted; they trim galley crimson prow'd
6861,ARGUMENT,"Have ne'er beheld, nor yet smooth-shaven oar,"
6862,ARGUMENT,With which the vessel wing'd scuds o'er the waves.
6863,ARGUMENT,Well thou shalt know them; this shall be the sign--
6864,ARGUMENT,"When thou shalt meet a trav'ler, who shall name"
6865,ARGUMENT,"The oar on thy broad shoulder borne, a van,[43]"
6866,ARGUMENT,"There, deep infixing it within the soil,"
6867,ARGUMENT,"Worship the King of Ocean with a bull,"
6868,ARGUMENT,"A ram, and a lascivious boar, then seek"
6869,ARGUMENT,"Thy home again, and sacrifice at home                            160"
6870,ARGUMENT,"An hecatomb to the Immortal Gods,"
6871,ARGUMENT,"Adoring each duly, and in his course."
6872,ARGUMENT,"So shalt thou die in peace a gentle death,"
6873,ARGUMENT,"Remote from Ocean; it shall find thee late,"
6874,ARGUMENT,"In soft serenity of age, the Chief"
6875,ARGUMENT,Of a blest people.--I have told thee truth.
6876,ARGUMENT,"He spake, to whom I answer thus return'd."
6877,ARGUMENT,"Tiresias! thou, I doubt not, hast reveal'd"
6878,ARGUMENT,"The ordinance of heav'n. But tell me, Seer!"
6879,ARGUMENT,And truly. I behold my mother's shade;                           170
6880,ARGUMENT,"Silent she sits beside the blood, nor word"
6881,ARGUMENT,Nor even look vouchsafes to her own son.
6882,ARGUMENT,"How shall she learn, prophet, that I am her's?"
6883,ARGUMENT,"So I, to whom Tiresias quick replied."
6884,ARGUMENT,"The course is easy. Learn it, taught by me."
6885,ARGUMENT,"What shade soe'er, by leave of thee obtain'd,"
6886,ARGUMENT,"Shall taste the blood, that shade will tell thee truth;"
6887,ARGUMENT,"The rest, prohibited, will all retire."
6888,ARGUMENT,When thus the spirit of the royal Seer
6889,ARGUMENT,"Had his prophetic mind reveal'd, again                           180"
6890,ARGUMENT,He enter'd Pluto's gates; but I unmoved
6891,ARGUMENT,Still waited till my mother's shade approach'd;
6892,ARGUMENT,"She drank the blood, then knew me, and in words"
6893,ARGUMENT,"Wing'd with affection, plaintive, thus began."
6894,ARGUMENT,"My son! how hast thou enter'd, still alive,"
6895,ARGUMENT,This darksome region? Difficult it is
6896,ARGUMENT,For living man to view the realms of death.
6897,ARGUMENT,"Broad rivers roll, and awful floods between,"
6898,ARGUMENT,"But chief, the Ocean, which to pass on foot,"
6899,ARGUMENT,"Or without ship, impossible is found.                            190"
6900,ARGUMENT,"Hast thou, long wand'ring in thy voyage home"
6901,ARGUMENT,"From Ilium, with thy ship and crew arrived,"
6902,ARGUMENT,Ithaca and thy consort yet unseen?
6903,ARGUMENT,"She spake, to whom this answer I return'd."
6904,ARGUMENT,My mother! me necessity constrain'd
6905,ARGUMENT,"To Pluto's dwelling, anxious to consult"
6906,ARGUMENT,Theban Tiresias; for I have not yet
6907,ARGUMENT,"Approach'd Achaia, nor have touch'd the shore"
6908,ARGUMENT,"Of Ithaca, but suff'ring ceaseless woe"
6909,ARGUMENT,"Have roam'd, since first in Agamemnon's train                    200"
6910,ARGUMENT,I went to combat with the sons of Troy.
6911,ARGUMENT,"But speak, my mother, and the truth alone;"
6912,ARGUMENT,What stroke of fate slew _thee_? Fell'st thou a prey
6913,ARGUMENT,To some slow malady? or by the shafts
6914,ARGUMENT,Of gentle Dian suddenly subdued?
6915,ARGUMENT,"Speak to me also of my ancient Sire,"
6916,ARGUMENT,"And of Telemachus, whom I left at home;"
6917,ARGUMENT,Possess I still unalienate and safe
6918,ARGUMENT,"My property, or hath some happier Chief"
6919,ARGUMENT,"Admittance free into my fortunes gain'd,                         210"
6920,ARGUMENT,No hope subsisting more of my return?
6921,ARGUMENT,The mind and purpose of my wedded wife
6922,ARGUMENT,Declare thou also. Dwells she with our son
6923,ARGUMENT,"Faithful to my domestic interests,"
6924,ARGUMENT,Or is she wedded to some Chief of Greece?
6925,ARGUMENT,"I ceas'd, when thus the venerable shade."
6926,ARGUMENT,Not so; she faithful still and patient dwells
6927,ARGUMENT,Thy roof beneath; but all her days and nights
6928,ARGUMENT,Devoting sad to anguish and to tears.
6929,ARGUMENT,Thy fortunes still are thine; Telemachus                         220
6930,ARGUMENT,"Cultivates, undisturb'd, thy land, and sits"
6931,ARGUMENT,"At many a noble banquet, such as well"
6932,ARGUMENT,"Beseems the splendour of his princely state,"
6933,ARGUMENT,For all invite him; at his farm retired
6934,ARGUMENT,"Thy father dwells, nor to the city comes,"
6935,ARGUMENT,"For aught; nor bed, nor furniture of bed,"
6936,ARGUMENT,"Furr'd cloaks or splendid arras he enjoys,"
6937,ARGUMENT,"But, with his servile hinds all winter sleeps"
6938,ARGUMENT,"In ashes and in dust at the hearth-side,"
6939,ARGUMENT,"Coarsely attired; again, when summer comes,                      230"
6940,ARGUMENT,"Or genial autumn, on the fallen leaves"
6941,ARGUMENT,"In any nook, not curious where, he finds"
6942,ARGUMENT,"There, stretch'd forlorn, nourishing grief, he weeps"
6943,ARGUMENT,"Thy lot, enfeebled now by num'rous years."
6944,ARGUMENT,So perish'd I; such fate I also found;
6945,ARGUMENT,"Me, neither the right-aiming arch'ress struck,"
6946,ARGUMENT,"Diana, with her gentle shafts, nor me"
6947,ARGUMENT,"Distemper slew, my limbs by slow degrees"
6948,ARGUMENT,"But sure, bereaving of their little life,                        240"
6949,ARGUMENT,"But long regret, tender solicitude,"
6950,ARGUMENT,"And recollection of thy kindness past,"
6951,ARGUMENT,"These, my Ulysses! fatal proved to me."
6952,ARGUMENT,"She said; I, ardent wish'd to clasp the shade"
6953,ARGUMENT,Of my departed mother; thrice I sprang
6954,ARGUMENT,"Toward her, by desire impetuous urged,"
6955,ARGUMENT,"And thrice she flitted from between my arms,"
6956,ARGUMENT,Light as a passing shadow or a dream.
6957,ARGUMENT,"Then, pierced by keener grief, in accents wing'd"
6958,ARGUMENT,With filial earnestness I thus replied.                          250
6959,ARGUMENT,"My mother, why elud'st thou my attempt"
6960,ARGUMENT,"To clasp thee, that ev'n here, in Pluto's realm,"
6961,ARGUMENT,We might to full satiety indulge
6962,ARGUMENT,"Our grief, enfolded in each other's arms?"
6963,ARGUMENT,"Hath Proserpine, alas! only dispatch'd"
6964,ARGUMENT,"A shadow to me, to augment my woe?"
6965,ARGUMENT,"Then, instant, thus the venerable form."
6966,ARGUMENT,"Ah, son! thou most afflicted of mankind!"
6967,ARGUMENT,"On thee, Jove's daughter, Proserpine, obtrudes"
6968,ARGUMENT,No airy semblance vain; but such the state                       260
6969,ARGUMENT,And nature is of mortals once deceased.
6970,ARGUMENT,"For they nor muscle have, nor flesh, nor bone;"
6971,ARGUMENT,All those (the spirit from the body once
6972,ARGUMENT,"Divorced) the violence of fire consumes,"
6973,ARGUMENT,"And, like a dream, the soul flies swift away."
6974,ARGUMENT,"But haste thou back to light, and, taught thyself"
6975,ARGUMENT,"These sacred truths, hereafter teach thy spouse."
6976,ARGUMENT,"Thus mutual we conferr'd. Then, thither came,"
6977,ARGUMENT,"Encouraged forth by royal Proserpine,"
6978,ARGUMENT,"Shades female num'rous, all who consorts, erst,                  270"
6979,ARGUMENT,Or daughters were of mighty Chiefs renown'd.
6980,ARGUMENT,About the sable blood frequent they swarm'd.
6981,ARGUMENT,"But I, consid'ring sat, how I might each"
6982,ARGUMENT,"Interrogate, and thus resolv'd. My sword"
6983,ARGUMENT,"Forth drawing from beside my sturdy thigh,"
6984,ARGUMENT,Firm I prohibited the ghosts to drink
6985,ARGUMENT,The blood together; they successive came;
6986,ARGUMENT,Each told her own distress; I question'd all.
6987,ARGUMENT,"There, first, the high-born Tyro I beheld;"
6988,ARGUMENT,"She claim'd Salmoneus as her sire, and wife                      280"
6989,ARGUMENT,"Was once of Cretheus, son of Æolus."
6990,ARGUMENT,"Enamour'd of Enipeus, stream divine,"
6991,ARGUMENT,"Loveliest of all that water earth, beside"
6992,ARGUMENT,"His limpid current she was wont to stray,"
6993,ARGUMENT,"When Ocean's God, (Enipeus' form assumed)"
6994,ARGUMENT,Within the eddy-whirling river's mouth
6995,ARGUMENT,"Embraced her; there, while the o'er-arching flood,"
6996,ARGUMENT,"Uplifted mountainous, conceal'd the God"
6997,ARGUMENT,"And his fair human bride, her virgin zone"
6998,ARGUMENT,"He loos'd, and o'er her eyes sweet sleep diffused.               290"
6999,ARGUMENT,"His am'rous purpose satisfied, he grasp'd"
7000,ARGUMENT,"Her hand, affectionate, and thus he said."
7001,ARGUMENT,"Rejoice in this my love, and when the year"
7002,ARGUMENT,"Shall tend to consummation of its course,"
7003,ARGUMENT,"Thou shalt produce illustrious twins, for love"
7004,ARGUMENT,Immortal never is unfruitful love.
7005,ARGUMENT,"Rear them with all a mother's care; meantime,"
7006,ARGUMENT,Hence to thy home. Be silent. Name it not.
7007,ARGUMENT,"For I am Neptune, Shaker of the shores."
7008,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he plunged into the billowy Deep.                   300"
7009,ARGUMENT,"She pregnant grown, Pelias and Neleus bore,"
7010,ARGUMENT,"Both, valiant ministers of mighty Jove."
7011,ARGUMENT,"In wide-spread Iäolchus Pelias dwelt,"
7012,ARGUMENT,Of num'rous flocks possess'd; but his abode
7013,ARGUMENT,Amid the sands of Pylus Neleus chose.
7014,ARGUMENT,"To Cretheus wedded next, the lovely nymph"
7015,ARGUMENT,"Yet other sons, Æson and Pheres bore,"
7016,ARGUMENT,And Amythaon of equestrian fame.
7017,ARGUMENT,"I, next, the daughter of Asopus saw,"
7018,ARGUMENT,Antiope; she gloried to have known                               310
7019,ARGUMENT,"Th' embrace of Jove himself, to whom she brought"
7020,ARGUMENT,"A double progeny, Amphion named"
7021,ARGUMENT,And Zethus; they the seven-gated Thebes
7022,ARGUMENT,"Founded and girded with strong tow'rs, because,"
7023,ARGUMENT,"Though puissant Heroes both, in spacious Thebes"
7024,ARGUMENT,"Unfenced by tow'rs, they could not dwell secure."
7025,ARGUMENT,"Alcmena, next, wife of Amphitryon"
7026,ARGUMENT,I saw; she in the arms of sov'reign Jove
7027,ARGUMENT,"The lion-hearted Hercules conceiv'd,"
7028,ARGUMENT,"And, after, bore to Creon brave in fight                         320"
7029,ARGUMENT,"His daughter Megara, by the noble son"
7030,ARGUMENT,Unconquer'd of Amphitryon espoused.
7031,ARGUMENT,"The beauteous Epicaste[44] saw I then,"
7032,ARGUMENT,"Mother of Oedipus, who guilt incurr'd"
7033,ARGUMENT,"Prodigious, wedded, unintentional,"
7034,ARGUMENT,"To her own son; his father first he slew,"
7035,ARGUMENT,"Then wedded her, which soon the Gods divulged."
7036,ARGUMENT,"He, under vengeance of offended heav'n,"
7037,ARGUMENT,"In pleasant Thebes dwelt miserable, King"
7038,ARGUMENT,Of the Cadmean race; she to the gates                            330
7039,ARGUMENT,"Of Ades brazen-barr'd despairing went,"
7040,ARGUMENT,Self-strangled by a cord fasten'd aloft
7041,ARGUMENT,"To her own palace-roof, and woes bequeath'd"
7042,ARGUMENT,(Such as the Fury sisters execute
7043,ARGUMENT,Innumerable) to her guilty son.
7044,ARGUMENT,"There also saw I Chloris, loveliest fair,"
7045,ARGUMENT,Whom Neleus woo'd and won with spousal gifts
7046,ARGUMENT,"Inestimable, by her beauty charm'd"
7047,ARGUMENT,"She youngest daughter was of Iasus' son,"
7048,ARGUMENT,"Amphion, in old time a sov'reign prince                          340"
7049,ARGUMENT,"In Minuëian Orchomenus,"
7050,ARGUMENT,And King of Pylus. Three illustrious sons
7051,ARGUMENT,"She bore to Neleus, Nestor, Chromius,"
7052,ARGUMENT,"And Periclymenus the wide-renown'd,"
7053,ARGUMENT,"And, last, produced a wonder of the earth,"
7054,ARGUMENT,"Pero, by ev'ry neighbour prince around"
7055,ARGUMENT,In marriage sought; but Neleus her on none
7056,ARGUMENT,"Deign'd to bestow, save only on the Chief"
7057,ARGUMENT,Who should from Phylace drive off the beeves
7058,ARGUMENT,"(Broad-fronted, and with jealous care secured)                   350"
7059,ARGUMENT,Of valiant Iphicles. One undertook
7060,ARGUMENT,"That task alone, a prophet high in fame,"
7061,ARGUMENT,Melampus; but the Fates fast bound him there
7062,ARGUMENT,In rig'rous bonds by rustic hands imposed.
7063,ARGUMENT,"At length (the year, with all its months and days"
7064,ARGUMENT,"Concluded, and the new-born year begun)"
7065,ARGUMENT,"Illustrious Iphicles releas'd the seer,"
7066,ARGUMENT,"Grateful for all the oracles resolved,[45]"
7067,ARGUMENT,Till then obscure. So stood the will of Jove.
7068,ARGUMENT,"Next, Leda, wife of Tyndarus I saw,                            360"
7069,ARGUMENT,"Who bore to Tyndarus a noble pair,"
7070,ARGUMENT,"Castor the bold, and Pollux cestus-famed."
7071,ARGUMENT,"They pris'ners in the fertile womb of earth,"
7072,ARGUMENT,"Though living, dwell, and even there from Jove"
7073,ARGUMENT,High priv'lege gain; alternate they revive
7074,ARGUMENT,"And die, and dignity partake divine."
7075,ARGUMENT,"The comfort of Aloëus, next, I view'd,"
7076,ARGUMENT,Iphimedeia; she th' embrace profess'd
7077,ARGUMENT,"Of Neptune to have shared, to whom she bore"
7078,ARGUMENT,"Two sons; short-lived they were, but godlike both,               370"
7079,ARGUMENT,Otus and Ephialtes far-renown'd.
7080,ARGUMENT,"Orion sole except, all-bounteous Earth"
7081,ARGUMENT,Ne'er nourish'd forms for beauty or for size
7082,ARGUMENT,To be admired as theirs; in his ninth year
7083,ARGUMENT,"Each measur'd, broad, nine cubits, and the height"
7084,ARGUMENT,Was found nine ells of each. Against the Gods
7085,ARGUMENT,"Themselves they threaten'd war, and to excite"
7086,ARGUMENT,The din of battle in the realms above.
7087,ARGUMENT,To the Olympian summit they essay'd
7088,ARGUMENT,"To heave up Ossa, and to Ossa's crown                            380"
7089,ARGUMENT,Branch-waving Pelion; so to climb the heav'ns.
7090,ARGUMENT,"Nor had they failed, maturer grown in might,"
7091,ARGUMENT,"To accomplish that emprize, but them the son[46]"
7092,ARGUMENT,Of radiant-hair'd Latona and of Jove
7093,ARGUMENT,"Slew both, ere yet the down of blooming youth"
7094,ARGUMENT,"Thick-sprung, their cheeks or chins had tufted o'er."
7095,ARGUMENT,"Phædra I also there, and Procris saw,"
7096,ARGUMENT,"And Ariadne for her beauty praised,"
7097,ARGUMENT,Whose sire was all-wise Minos. Theseus her
7098,ARGUMENT,From Crete toward the fruitful region bore                       390
7099,ARGUMENT,"Of sacred Athens, but enjoy'd not there,"
7100,ARGUMENT,"For, first, she perish'd by Diana's shafts"
7101,ARGUMENT,"In Dia, Bacchus witnessing her crime.[47]"
7102,ARGUMENT,"Mæra and Clymene I saw beside,"
7103,ARGUMENT,"And odious Eriphyle, who received"
7104,ARGUMENT,The price in gold of her own husband's life.
7105,ARGUMENT,"But all the wives of Heroes whom I saw,"
7106,ARGUMENT,And all their daughters can I not relate;
7107,ARGUMENT,"Night, first, would fail; and even now the hour"
7108,ARGUMENT,"Calls me to rest either on board my bark,                        400"
7109,ARGUMENT,"Or here; meantime, I in yourselves confide,"
7110,ARGUMENT,And in the Gods to shape my conduct home.
7111,ARGUMENT,"He ceased; the whole assembly silent sat,"
7112,ARGUMENT,Charm'd into ecstacy by his discourse
7113,ARGUMENT,"Throughout the twilight hall, till, at the last,"
7114,ARGUMENT,Areta iv'ry arm'd them thus bespake.
7115,ARGUMENT,Phæacians! how appears he in your eyes
7116,ARGUMENT,"This stranger, graceful as he is in port,"
7117,ARGUMENT,"In stature noble, and in mind discrete?"
7118,ARGUMENT,"My guest he is, but ye all share with me                         410"
7119,ARGUMENT,"That honour; him dismiss not, therefore, hence"
7120,ARGUMENT,"With haste, nor from such indigence withhold"
7121,ARGUMENT,"Supplies gratuitous; for ye are rich,"
7122,ARGUMENT,And by kind heav'n with rare possessions blest.
7123,ARGUMENT,"The Hero, next, Echeneus spake, a Chief"
7124,ARGUMENT,"Now ancient, eldest of Phæacia's sons."
7125,ARGUMENT,"Your prudent Queen, my friends, speaks not beside"
7126,ARGUMENT,"Her proper scope, but as beseems her well."
7127,ARGUMENT,Her voice obey; yet the effect of all
7128,ARGUMENT,Must on Alcinoüs himself depend.                                 420
7129,ARGUMENT,"To whom Alcinoüs, thus, the King, replied."
7130,ARGUMENT,"I ratify the word. So shall be done,"
7131,ARGUMENT,As surely as myself shall live supreme
7132,ARGUMENT,O'er all Phæacia's maritime domain.
7133,ARGUMENT,"Then let the guest, though anxious to depart,"
7134,ARGUMENT,"Wait till the morrow, that I may complete"
7135,ARGUMENT,The whole donation. His safe conduct home
7136,ARGUMENT,"Shall be the gen'ral care, but mine in Chief,"
7137,ARGUMENT,To whom dominion o'er the rest belongs.
7138,ARGUMENT,"Him answer'd, then, Ulysses ever-wise.                         430"
7139,ARGUMENT,Alcinoüs! Prince! exalted high o'er all
7140,ARGUMENT,"Phæacia's sons! should ye solicit, kind,"
7141,ARGUMENT,"My stay throughout the year, preparing still"
7142,ARGUMENT,"My conduct home, and with illustrious gifts"
7143,ARGUMENT,"Enriching me the while, ev'n that request"
7144,ARGUMENT,"Should please me well; the wealthier I return'd,"
7145,ARGUMENT,The happier my condition; welcome more
7146,ARGUMENT,And more respectable I should appear
7147,ARGUMENT,In ev'ry eye to Ithaca restored.
7148,ARGUMENT,To whom Alcinoüs answer thus return'd.                         440
7149,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses! viewing thee, no fears we feel"
7150,ARGUMENT,"Lest thou, at length, some false pretender prove,"
7151,ARGUMENT,"Or subtle hypocrite, of whom no few"
7152,ARGUMENT,Disseminated o'er its face the earth
7153,ARGUMENT,"Sustains, adepts in fiction, and who frame"
7154,ARGUMENT,"Fables, where fables could be least surmised."
7155,ARGUMENT,"Thy phrase well turn'd, and thy ingenuous mind"
7156,ARGUMENT,"Proclaim _thee_ diff'rent far, who hast in strains"
7157,ARGUMENT,"Musical as a poet's voice, the woes"
7158,ARGUMENT,"Rehears'd of all thy Greecians, and thy own.                     450"
7159,ARGUMENT,"But say, and tell me true. Beheld'st thou there"
7160,ARGUMENT,None of thy followers to the walls of Troy
7161,ARGUMENT,Slain in that warfare? Lo! the night is long--
7162,ARGUMENT,A night of utmost length; nor yet the hour
7163,ARGUMENT,"Invites to sleep. Tell me thy wond'rous deeds,"
7164,ARGUMENT,"For I could watch till sacred dawn, could'st thou"
7165,ARGUMENT,So long endure to tell me of thy toils.
7166,ARGUMENT,"Then thus Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
7167,ARGUMENT,Alcinoüs! high exalted over all
7168,ARGUMENT,Phæacia's sons! the time suffices yet                            460
7169,ARGUMENT,"For converse both and sleep, and if thou wish"
7170,ARGUMENT,"To hear still more, I shall not spare to unfold"
7171,ARGUMENT,"More pitiable woes than these, sustain'd"
7172,ARGUMENT,"By my companions, in the end destroy'd;"
7173,ARGUMENT,"Who, saved from perils of disast'rous war"
7174,ARGUMENT,"At Ilium, perish'd yet in their return,"
7175,ARGUMENT,Victims of a pernicious woman's crime.[48]
7176,ARGUMENT,"Now, when chaste Proserpine had wide dispers'd"
7177,ARGUMENT,"Those female shades, the spirit sore distress'd"
7178,ARGUMENT,"Of Agamemnon, Atreus' son, appear'd;                             470"
7179,ARGUMENT,"Encircled by a throng, he came; by all"
7180,ARGUMENT,Who with himself beneath Ægisthus' roof
7181,ARGUMENT,"Their fate fulfill'd, perishing by the sword."
7182,ARGUMENT,"He drank the blood, and knew me; shrill he wail'd"
7183,ARGUMENT,"And querulous; tears trickling bathed his cheeks,"
7184,ARGUMENT,"And with spread palms, through ardour of desire"
7185,ARGUMENT,"He sought to enfold me fast, but vigour none,"
7186,ARGUMENT,"Or force, as erst, his agile limbs inform'd."
7187,ARGUMENT,"I, pity-moved, wept at the sight, and him,"
7188,ARGUMENT,"In accents wing'd by friendship, thus address'd.                 480"
7189,ARGUMENT,"Ah glorious son of Atreus, King of men!"
7190,ARGUMENT,What hand inflicted the all-numbing stroke
7191,ARGUMENT,"Of death on thee? Say, didst thou perish sunk"
7192,ARGUMENT,By howling tempests irresistible
7193,ARGUMENT,"Which Neptune raised, or on dry land by force"
7194,ARGUMENT,"Of hostile multitudes, while cutting off"
7195,ARGUMENT,"Beeves from the herd, or driving flocks away,"
7196,ARGUMENT,"Or fighting for Achaia's daughters, shut"
7197,ARGUMENT,Within some city's bulwarks close besieged?
7198,ARGUMENT,"I ceased, when Agamemnon thus replied.                         490"
7199,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, noble Chief, Laertes' son"
7200,ARGUMENT,For wisdom famed! I neither perish'd sunk
7201,ARGUMENT,By howling tempests irresistible
7202,ARGUMENT,"Which Neptune raised, nor on dry land received"
7203,ARGUMENT,"From hostile multitudes the fatal blow,"
7204,ARGUMENT,But me Ægisthus slew; my woeful death
7205,ARGUMENT,Confed'rate with my own pernicious wife
7206,ARGUMENT,"He plotted, with a show of love sincere"
7207,ARGUMENT,"Bidding me to his board, where as the ox"
7208,ARGUMENT,"Is slaughter'd at his crib, he slaughter'd _me_.                 500"
7209,ARGUMENT,Such was my dreadful death; carnage ensued
7210,ARGUMENT,"Continual of my friends slain all around,"
7211,ARGUMENT,"Num'rous as boars bright-tusk'd at nuptial feast,"
7212,ARGUMENT,Or feast convivial of some wealthy Chief.
7213,ARGUMENT,Thou hast already witness'd many a field
7214,ARGUMENT,"With warriors overspread, slain one by one,"
7215,ARGUMENT,"But that dire scene had most thy pity moved,"
7216,ARGUMENT,"For we, with brimming beakers at our side,"
7217,ARGUMENT,And underneath full tables bleeding lay.
7218,ARGUMENT,Blood floated all the pavement. Then the cries                   510
7219,ARGUMENT,Of Priam's daughter sounded in my ears
7220,ARGUMENT,"Most pitiable of all. Cassandra's cries,"
7221,ARGUMENT,Whom Clytemnestra close beside me slew.
7222,ARGUMENT,"Expiring as I lay, I yet essay'd"
7223,ARGUMENT,"To grasp my faulchion, but the trayt'ress quick"
7224,ARGUMENT,"Withdrew herself, nor would vouchsafe to close"
7225,ARGUMENT,"My languid eyes, or prop my drooping chin"
7226,ARGUMENT,Ev'n in the moment when I sought the shades.
7227,ARGUMENT,"So that the thing breathes not, ruthless and fell"
7228,ARGUMENT,As woman once resolv'd on such a deed                            520
7229,ARGUMENT,"Detestable, as my base wife contrived,"
7230,ARGUMENT,The murther of the husband of her youth.
7231,ARGUMENT,"I thought to have return'd welcome to all,"
7232,ARGUMENT,To my own children and domestic train;
7233,ARGUMENT,"But she, past measure profligate, hath poured"
7234,ARGUMENT,"Shame on herself, on women yet unborn,"
7235,ARGUMENT,And even on the virtuous of her sex.
7236,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd, to whom, thus, answer I return'd."
7237,ARGUMENT,Gods! how severely hath the thund'rer plagued
7238,ARGUMENT,"The house of Atreus even from the first,                         530"
7239,ARGUMENT,By female counsels! we for Helen's sake
7240,ARGUMENT,"Have num'rous died, and Clytemnestra framed,"
7241,ARGUMENT,"While thou wast far remote, this snare for thee!"
7242,ARGUMENT,"So I, to whom Atrides thus replied."
7243,ARGUMENT,"Thou, therefore, be not pliant overmuch"
7244,ARGUMENT,"To woman; trust her not with all thy mind,"
7245,ARGUMENT,"But half disclose to her, and half conceal."
7246,ARGUMENT,"Yet, from thy consort's hand no bloody death,"
7247,ARGUMENT,"My friend, hast thou to fear; for passing wise"
7248,ARGUMENT,"Icarius' daughter is, far other thoughts,                        540"
7249,ARGUMENT,"Intelligent, and other plans, to frame."
7250,ARGUMENT,"Her, going to the wars we left a bride"
7251,ARGUMENT,"New-wedded, and thy boy hung at her breast,"
7252,ARGUMENT,"Who, man himself, consorts ere now with men"
7253,ARGUMENT,"A prosp'rous youth; his father, safe restored"
7254,ARGUMENT,"To his own Ithaca, shall see him soon,"
7255,ARGUMENT,And _he_ shall clasp his father in his arms
7256,ARGUMENT,"As nature bids; but me, my cruel one"
7257,ARGUMENT,Indulged not with the dear delight to gaze
7258,ARGUMENT,"On my Orestes, for she slew me first.                            550"
7259,ARGUMENT,But listen; treasure what I now impart.[49]
7260,ARGUMENT,Steer secret to thy native isle; avoid
7261,ARGUMENT,Notice; for woman merits trust no more.
7262,ARGUMENT,Now tell me truth. Hear ye in whose abode
7263,ARGUMENT,"My son resides? dwells he in Pylus, say,"
7264,ARGUMENT,"Or in Orchomenos, or else beneath"
7265,ARGUMENT,My brother's roof in Sparta's wide domain?
7266,ARGUMENT,For my Orestes is not yet a shade.
7267,ARGUMENT,"So he, to whom I answer thus return'd."
7268,ARGUMENT,"Atrides, ask not me. Whether he live,                            560"
7269,ARGUMENT,"Or have already died, I nothing know;"
7270,ARGUMENT,"Mere words are vanity, and better spared."
7271,ARGUMENT,"Thus we discoursing mutual stood, and tears"
7272,ARGUMENT,"Shedding disconsolate. The shade, meantime,"
7273,ARGUMENT,"Came of Achilles, Peleus' mighty son;"
7274,ARGUMENT,"Patroclus also, and Antilochus"
7275,ARGUMENT,"Appear'd, with Ajax, for proportion just"
7276,ARGUMENT,"And stature tall, (Pelides sole except)"
7277,ARGUMENT,Distinguish'd above all Achaia's sons.
7278,ARGUMENT,The soul of swift Æacides at once                                570
7279,ARGUMENT,"Knew me, and in wing'd accents thus began."
7280,ARGUMENT,"Brave Laertiades, for wiles renown'd!"
7281,ARGUMENT,What mightier enterprise than all the past
7282,ARGUMENT,Hath made thee here a guest? rash as thou art!
7283,ARGUMENT,How hast thou dared to penetrate the gloom
7284,ARGUMENT,"Of Ades, dwelling of the shadowy dead,"
7285,ARGUMENT,Semblances only of what once they were?
7286,ARGUMENT,"He spake, to whom I, answ'ring, thus replied."
7287,ARGUMENT,O Peleus' son! Achilles! bravest far
7288,ARGUMENT,Of all Achaia's race! I here arrived                             580
7289,ARGUMENT,"Seeking Tiresias, from his lips to learn,"
7290,ARGUMENT,"Perchance, how I might safe regain the coast"
7291,ARGUMENT,Of craggy Ithaca; for tempest-toss'd
7292,ARGUMENT,"Perpetual, I have neither yet approach'd"
7293,ARGUMENT,"Achaia's shore, or landed on my own."
7294,ARGUMENT,"But as for thee, Achilles! never man"
7295,ARGUMENT,"Hath known felicity like thine, or shall,"
7296,ARGUMENT,"Whom living we all honour'd as a God,"
7297,ARGUMENT,"And who maintain'st, here resident, supreme"
7298,ARGUMENT,"Controul among the dead; indulge not then,                       590"
7299,ARGUMENT,"Achilles, causeless grief that thou hast died."
7300,ARGUMENT,"I ceased, and answer thus instant received."
7301,ARGUMENT,Renown'd Ulysses! think not death a theme
7302,ARGUMENT,Of consolation; I had rather live
7303,ARGUMENT,"The servile hind for hire, and eat the bread"
7304,ARGUMENT,"Of some man scantily himself sustain'd,"
7305,ARGUMENT,Than sov'reign empire hold o'er all the shades.
7306,ARGUMENT,But come--speak to me of my noble boy;
7307,ARGUMENT,"Proceeds he, as he promis'd, brave in arms,"
7308,ARGUMENT,"Or shuns he war? Say also, hast thou heard                       600"
7309,ARGUMENT,Of royal Peleus? shares he still respect
7310,ARGUMENT,"Among his num'rous Myrmidons, or scorn"
7311,ARGUMENT,"In Hellas and in Phthia, for that age"
7312,ARGUMENT,Predominates in his enfeebled limbs?
7313,ARGUMENT,For help is none in me; the glorious sun
7314,ARGUMENT,"No longer sees me such, as when in aid"
7315,ARGUMENT,Of the Achaians I o'erspread the field
7316,ARGUMENT,Of spacious Troy with all their bravest slain.
7317,ARGUMENT,"Oh might I, vigorous as then, repair[50]"
7318,ARGUMENT,"For one short moment to my father's house,                       610"
7319,ARGUMENT,"They all should tremble; I would shew an arm,"
7320,ARGUMENT,Such as should daunt the fiercest who presumes
7321,ARGUMENT,"To injure _him_, or to despise his age."
7322,ARGUMENT,"Achilles spake, to whom I thus replied."
7323,ARGUMENT,Of noble Peleus have I nothing heard;
7324,ARGUMENT,"But I will tell thee, as thou bidd'st, the truth"
7325,ARGUMENT,Unfeign'd of Neoptolemus thy son;
7326,ARGUMENT,"For him, myself, on board my hollow bark"
7327,ARGUMENT,From Scyros to Achaia's host convey'd.
7328,ARGUMENT,Oft as in council under Ilium's walls                            620
7329,ARGUMENT,"We met, he ever foremost was in speech,"
7330,ARGUMENT,Nor spake erroneous; Nestor and myself
7331,ARGUMENT,"Except, no Greecian could with him compare."
7332,ARGUMENT,"Oft, too, as we with battle hemm'd around"
7333,ARGUMENT,"Troy's bulwarks, from among the mingled crowd"
7334,ARGUMENT,"Thy son sprang foremost into martial act,"
7335,ARGUMENT,Inferior in heroic worth to none.
7336,ARGUMENT,Beneath him num'rous fell the sons of Troy
7337,ARGUMENT,"In dreadful fight, nor have I pow'r to name"
7338,ARGUMENT,"Distinctly all, who by his glorious arm                          630"
7339,ARGUMENT,"Exerted in the cause of Greece, expired."
7340,ARGUMENT,"Yet will I name Eurypylus, the son"
7341,ARGUMENT,"Of Telephus, an Hero whom his sword"
7342,ARGUMENT,"Of life bereaved, and all around him strew'd"
7343,ARGUMENT,"The plain with his Cetean warriors, won"
7344,ARGUMENT,To Ilium's side by bribes to women giv'n.[51]
7345,ARGUMENT,"Save noble Memnon only, I beheld"
7346,ARGUMENT,No Chief at Ilium beautiful as he.
7347,ARGUMENT,"Again, when we within the horse of wood"
7348,ARGUMENT,"Framed by Epeüs sat, an ambush chos'n                            640"
7349,ARGUMENT,"Of all the bravest Greeks, and I in trust"
7350,ARGUMENT,Was placed to open or to keep fast-closed
7351,ARGUMENT,"The hollow fraud; then, ev'ry Chieftain there"
7352,ARGUMENT,And Senator of Greece wiped from his cheeks
7353,ARGUMENT,"The tears, and tremors felt in ev'ry limb;"
7354,ARGUMENT,But never saw I changed to terror's hue
7355,ARGUMENT,"_His_ ruddy cheek, no tears wiped _he_ away,"
7356,ARGUMENT,"But oft he press'd me to go forth, his suit"
7357,ARGUMENT,"With pray'rs enforcing, griping hard his hilt"
7358,ARGUMENT,"And his brass-burthen'd spear, and dire revenge                  650"
7359,ARGUMENT,"Denouncing, ardent, on the race of Troy."
7360,ARGUMENT,"At length, when we had sack'd the lofty town"
7361,ARGUMENT,"Of Priam, laden with abundant spoils"
7362,ARGUMENT,"He safe embark'd, neither by spear or shaft"
7363,ARGUMENT,"Aught hurt, or in close fight by faulchion's edge,"
7364,ARGUMENT,"As oft in war befalls, where wounds are dealt"
7365,ARGUMENT,Promiscuous at the will of fiery Mars.
7366,ARGUMENT,"So I; then striding large, the spirit thence"
7367,ARGUMENT,"Withdrew of swift Æacides, along"
7368,ARGUMENT,"The hoary mead pacing,[52] with joy elate                        660"
7369,ARGUMENT,That I had blazon'd bright his son's renown.
7370,ARGUMENT,The other souls of men by death dismiss'd
7371,ARGUMENT,"Stood mournful by, sad uttering each his woes;"
7372,ARGUMENT,The soul alone I saw standing remote
7373,ARGUMENT,"Of Telamonian Ajax, still incensed"
7374,ARGUMENT,That in our public contest for the arms
7375,ARGUMENT,"Worn by Achilles, and by Thetis thrown"
7376,ARGUMENT,"Into dispute, my claim had strongest proved,"
7377,ARGUMENT,Troy and Minerva judges of the cause.
7378,ARGUMENT,Disastrous victory! which I could wish                           670
7379,ARGUMENT,"Not to have won, since for that armour's sake"
7380,ARGUMENT,"The earth hath cover'd Ajax, in his form"
7381,ARGUMENT,And martial deeds superior far to all
7382,ARGUMENT,"The Greecians, Peleus' matchless son except."
7383,ARGUMENT,"I, seeking to appease him, thus began."
7384,ARGUMENT,"O Ajax, son of glorious Telamon!"
7385,ARGUMENT,"Canst thou remember, even after death,"
7386,ARGUMENT,"Thy wrath against me, kindled for the sake"
7387,ARGUMENT,Of those pernicious arms? arms which the Gods
7388,ARGUMENT,"Ordain'd of such dire consequence to Greece,                     680"
7389,ARGUMENT,"Which caused thy death, our bulwark! Thee we mourn"
7390,ARGUMENT,"With grief perpetual, nor the death lament"
7391,ARGUMENT,"Of Peleus' son, Achilles, more than thine."
7392,ARGUMENT,Yet none is blameable; Jove evermore
7393,ARGUMENT,"With bitt'rest hate pursued Achaia's host,"
7394,ARGUMENT,"And he ordain'd thy death. Hero! approach,"
7395,ARGUMENT,That thou may'st hear the words with which I seek
7396,ARGUMENT,To sooth thee; let thy long displeasure cease!
7397,ARGUMENT,Quell all resentment in thy gen'rous breast!
7398,ARGUMENT,"I spake; nought answer'd he, but sullen join'd                 690"
7399,ARGUMENT,"His fellow-ghosts; yet, angry as he was,"
7400,ARGUMENT,"I had prevail'd even on him to speak,"
7401,ARGUMENT,"Or had, at least, accosted him again,"
7402,ARGUMENT,But that my bosom teem'd with strong desire
7403,ARGUMENT,"Urgent, to see yet others of the dead."
7404,ARGUMENT,"There saw I Minos, offspring famed of Jove;"
7405,ARGUMENT,"His golden sceptre in his hand, he sat"
7406,ARGUMENT,"Judge of the dead; they, pleading each in turn,"
7407,ARGUMENT,"His cause, some stood, some sat, filling the house"
7408,ARGUMENT,Whose spacious folding-gates are never closed.                   700
7409,ARGUMENT,"Orion next, huge ghost, engaged my view,"
7410,ARGUMENT,"Droves urging o'er the grassy mead, of beasts"
7411,ARGUMENT,"Which he had slain, himself, on the wild hills,"
7412,ARGUMENT,With strong club arm'd of ever-during brass.
7413,ARGUMENT,There also Tityus on the ground I saw
7414,ARGUMENT,"Extended, offspring of the glorious earth;"
7415,ARGUMENT,"Nine acres he o'erspread, and, at his side"
7416,ARGUMENT,"Station'd, two vultures on his liver prey'd,"
7417,ARGUMENT,Scooping his entrails; nor sufficed his hands
7418,ARGUMENT,To fray them thence; for he had sought to force                  710
7419,ARGUMENT,"Latona, illustrious concubine of Jove,"
7420,ARGUMENT,What time the Goddess journey'd o'er the rocks
7421,ARGUMENT,Of Pytho into pleasant Panopeus.

7663,ARGUMENT,"Perpetual, which nor autumn sees dispers'd"

7674,ARGUMENT,Tremendous; shrill her voice is as the note

7686,ARGUMENT,"More bulky, such as in the roaring gulphs"
7687,ARGUMENT,Of Amphitrite without end abounds.
7688,ARGUMENT,It is no seaman's boast that e'er he slipp'd
7689,ARGUMENT,"Her cavern by, unharm'd. In ev'ry mouth"

7693,ARGUMENT,"On this a wild fig grows broad-leav'd, and here"
7694,ARGUMENT,Charybdis dire ingulphs the sable flood.

7696,ARGUMENT,"Thrice swallows it. Ah! well forewarn'd, beware"
7697,ARGUMENT,"What time she swallows, that thou come not nigh,"
7698,ARGUMENT,"For not himself, Neptune, could snatch thee thence."
7699,ARGUMENT,"Close passing Scylla's rock, shoot swift thy bark"
7700,ARGUMENT,"Beyond it, since the loss of six alone"
7701,ARGUMENT,Is better far than shipwreck made of all.
7702,ARGUMENT,"So Circe spake, to whom I thus replied.                        130"
7703,ARGUMENT,"Tell me, O Goddess, next, and tell me true!"
7704,ARGUMENT,"If, chance, from fell Charybdis I escape,"
7705,ARGUMENT,May I not also save from Scylla's force
7706,ARGUMENT,My people; should the monster threaten them?
7707,ARGUMENT,"I said, and quick the Goddess in return."
7708,ARGUMENT,Unhappy! can exploits and toils of war
7709,ARGUMENT,Still please thee? yield'st not to the Gods themselves?
7710,ARGUMENT,"She is no mortal, but a deathless pest,"
7711,ARGUMENT,"Impracticable, savage, battle-proof."
7712,ARGUMENT,Defence is vain; flight is thy sole resource.                    140
7713,ARGUMENT,For should'st thou linger putting on thy arms
7714,ARGUMENT,"Beside the rock, beware, lest darting forth"
7715,ARGUMENT,"Her num'rous heads, she seize with ev'ry mouth"
7716,ARGUMENT,"A Greecian, and with others, even thee."
7717,ARGUMENT,"Pass therefore swift, and passing, loud invoke"
7718,ARGUMENT,"Cratais, mother of this plague of man,"
7719,ARGUMENT,Who will forbid her to assail thee more.
7720,ARGUMENT,"Thou, next, shalt reach Thrinacia; there, the beeves"
7721,ARGUMENT,And fatted flocks graze num'rous of the Sun;
7722,ARGUMENT,Sev'n herds; as many flocks of snowy fleece;                     150
7723,ARGUMENT,"Fifty in each; they breed not, neither die,"
7724,ARGUMENT,"Nor are they kept by less than Goddesses,"
7725,ARGUMENT,"Lampetia fair, and Phäethusa, both"
7726,ARGUMENT,By nymph Neæra to Hyperion borne.
7727,ARGUMENT,"Them, soon as she had train'd them to an age"
7728,ARGUMENT,"Proportion'd to that charge, their mother sent"
7729,ARGUMENT,"Into Thrinacia, there to dwell and keep"
7730,ARGUMENT,Inviolate their father's flocks and herds.
7731,ARGUMENT,"If, anxious for a safe return, thou spare"
7732,ARGUMENT,"Those herds and flocks, though after much endured,               160"
7733,ARGUMENT,Ye may at last your Ithaca regain;
7734,ARGUMENT,"But should'st thou violate them, I foretell"
7735,ARGUMENT,"Destruction of thy ship and of thy crew,"
7736,ARGUMENT,"And though thyself escape, thou shalt return"
7737,ARGUMENT,"Late, in ill plight, and all thy friends destroy'd."
7738,ARGUMENT,"She ended, and the golden morning dawn'd."
7739,ARGUMENT,"Then, all-divine, her graceful steps she turn'd"
7740,ARGUMENT,"Back through the isle, and, at the beach arrived,"
7741,ARGUMENT,I summon'd all my followers to ascend
7742,ARGUMENT,"The bark again, and cast the hawsers loose.                      170"
7743,ARGUMENT,"They, at my voice, embarking, fill'd in ranks"
7744,ARGUMENT,"The seats, and rowing, thresh'd the hoary flood."
7745,ARGUMENT,"And now, melodious Circe, nymph divine,"
7746,ARGUMENT,"Sent after us a canvas-stretching breeze,"
7747,ARGUMENT,"Pleasant companion of our course, and we"
7748,ARGUMENT,"(The decks and benches clear'd) untoiling sat,"
7749,ARGUMENT,While managed gales sped swift the bark along.
7750,ARGUMENT,"Then, with dejected heart, thus I began."
7751,ARGUMENT,Oh friends! (for it is needful that not one
7752,ARGUMENT,Or two alone the admonition hear                                 180
7753,ARGUMENT,"Of Circe, beauteous prophetess divine)"
7754,ARGUMENT,"To all I speak, that whether we escape"
7755,ARGUMENT,"Or perish, all may be, at least, forewarn'd."
7756,ARGUMENT,"She bids us, first, avoid the dang'rous song"
7757,ARGUMENT,Of the sweet Sirens and their flow'ry meads.
7758,ARGUMENT,Me only she permits those strains to hear;
7759,ARGUMENT,But ye shall bind me with coercion strong
7760,ARGUMENT,"Of cordage well-secured to the mast-foot,"
7761,ARGUMENT,And by no struggles to be loos'd of mine.
7762,ARGUMENT,But should I supplicate to be released                           190
7763,ARGUMENT,"Or give such order, then, with added cords"
7764,ARGUMENT,Be it your part to bind me still the more.
7765,ARGUMENT,Thus with distinct precaution I prepared
7766,ARGUMENT,"My people; rapid in her course, meantime,"
7767,ARGUMENT,"My gallant bark approach'd the Sirens' isle,"
7768,ARGUMENT,For brisk and favourable blew the wind.
7769,ARGUMENT,"Then fell the wind suddenly, and serene"
7770,ARGUMENT,"A breathless calm ensued, while all around"
7771,ARGUMENT,"The billows slumber'd, lull'd by pow'r divine."
7772,ARGUMENT,"Up-sprang my people, and the folded sails                        200"
7773,ARGUMENT,"Bestowing in the hold, sat to their oars,"
7774,ARGUMENT,Which with their polish'd blades whiten'd the Deep.
7775,ARGUMENT,"I, then, with edge of steel sev'ring minute"
7776,ARGUMENT,"A waxen cake, chafed it and moulded it"
7777,ARGUMENT,Between my palms; ere long the ductile mass
7778,ARGUMENT,"Grew warm, obedient to that ceaseless force,"
7779,ARGUMENT,And to Hyperion's all-pervading beams.
7780,ARGUMENT,With that soft liniment I fill'd the ears
7781,ARGUMENT,"Of my companions, man by man, and they"
7782,ARGUMENT,My feet and arms with strong coercion bound                      210
7783,ARGUMENT,Of cordage to the mast-foot well secured.
7784,ARGUMENT,"Then down they sat, and, rowing, thresh'd the brine."
7785,ARGUMENT,But when with rapid course we had arrived
7786,ARGUMENT,"Within such distance as a voice may reach,"
7787,ARGUMENT,Not unperceived by them the gliding bark
7788,ARGUMENT,"Approach'd, and, thus, harmonious they began."
7789,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, Chief by ev'ry tongue extoll'd,"
7790,ARGUMENT,"Achaia's boast, oh hither steer thy bark!"
7791,ARGUMENT,"Here stay thy course, and listen to our lay!"
7792,ARGUMENT,These shores none passes in his sable ship                       220
7793,ARGUMENT,"Till, first, the warblings of our voice he hear,"
7794,ARGUMENT,"Then, happier hence and wiser he departs."
7795,ARGUMENT,"All that the Greeks endured, and all the ills"
7796,ARGUMENT,"Inflicted by the Gods on Troy, we know,"
7797,ARGUMENT,Know all that passes on the boundless earth.
7798,ARGUMENT,So they with voices sweet their music poured
7799,ARGUMENT,"Melodious on my ear, winning with ease"
7800,ARGUMENT,"My heart's desire to listen, and by signs"
7801,ARGUMENT,"I bade my people, instant, set me free."
7802,ARGUMENT,"But they incumbent row'd, and from their seats                   230"
7803,ARGUMENT,Eurylochus and Perimedes sprang
7804,ARGUMENT,With added cords to bind me still the more.
7805,ARGUMENT,"This danger past, and when the Sirens' voice,"
7806,ARGUMENT,"Now left remote, had lost its pow'r to charm,"
7807,ARGUMENT,"Then, my companions freeing from the wax"
7808,ARGUMENT,"Their ears, deliver'd me from my restraint."
7809,ARGUMENT,"The island left afar, soon I discern'd"
7810,ARGUMENT,"Huge waves, and smoke, and horrid thund'rings heard."
7811,ARGUMENT,All sat aghast; forth flew at once the oars
7812,ARGUMENT,"From ev'ry hand, and with a clash the waves                      240"
7813,ARGUMENT,"Smote all together; check'd, the galley stood,"
7814,ARGUMENT,"By billow-sweeping oars no longer urged,"
7815,ARGUMENT,"And I, throughout the bark, man after man"
7816,ARGUMENT,"Encouraged all, addressing thus my crew."
7817,ARGUMENT,"We meet not, now, my friends, our first distress."
7818,ARGUMENT,This evil is not greater than we found
7819,ARGUMENT,When the huge Cyclops in his hollow den
7820,ARGUMENT,"Imprison'd us, yet even thence we 'scaped,"
7821,ARGUMENT,My intrepidity and fertile thought
7822,ARGUMENT,Opening the way; and we shall recollect                          250
7823,ARGUMENT,"These dangers also, in due time, with joy."
7824,ARGUMENT,"Come, then--pursue my counsel. Ye your seats"
7825,ARGUMENT,"Still occupying, smite the furrow'd flood"
7826,ARGUMENT,"With well-timed strokes, that by the will of Jove"
7827,ARGUMENT,"We may escape, perchance, this death, secure."
7828,ARGUMENT,"To thee the pilot thus I speak, (my words"
7829,ARGUMENT,"Mark thou, for at thy touch the rudder moves)"
7830,ARGUMENT,"This smoke, and these tumultuous waves avoid;"
7831,ARGUMENT,Steer wide of both; yet with an eye intent
7832,ARGUMENT,"On yonder rock, lest unaware thou hold                           260"
7833,ARGUMENT,"Too near a course, and plunge us into harm."
7834,ARGUMENT,"So I; with whose advice all, quick, complied."
7835,ARGUMENT,"But Scylla I as yet named not, (that woe"
7836,ARGUMENT,"Without a cure) lest, terrified, my crew"
7837,ARGUMENT,"Should all renounce their oars, and crowd below."
7838,ARGUMENT,"Just then, forgetful of the strict command"
7839,ARGUMENT,"Of Circe not to arm, I cloath'd me all"
7840,ARGUMENT,"In radiant armour, grasp'd two quiv'ring spears,"
7841,ARGUMENT,"And to the deck ascended at the prow,"
7842,ARGUMENT,"Expecting earliest notice there, what time                       270"
7843,ARGUMENT,The rock-bred Scylla should annoy my friends.
7844,ARGUMENT,"But I discern'd her not, nor could, although"
7845,ARGUMENT,To weariness of sight the dusky rock
7846,ARGUMENT,"I vigilant explored. Thus, many a groan"
7847,ARGUMENT,"Heaving, we navigated sad the streight,"
7848,ARGUMENT,"For here stood Scylla, while Charybdis there"
7849,ARGUMENT,With hoarse throat deep absorb'd the briny flood.
7850,ARGUMENT,"Oft as she vomited the deluge forth,"
7851,ARGUMENT,Like water cauldron'd o'er a furious fire
7852,ARGUMENT,"The whirling Deep all murmur'd, and the spray                    280"
7853,ARGUMENT,On both those rocky summits fell in show'rs.
7854,ARGUMENT,"But when she suck'd the salt wave down again,"
7855,ARGUMENT,"Then, all the pool appear'd wheeling about"
7856,ARGUMENT,"Within, the rock rebellow'd, and the sea"
7857,ARGUMENT,Drawn off into that gulph disclosed to view
7858,ARGUMENT,The oozy bottom. Us pale horror seized.
7859,ARGUMENT,"Thus, dreading death, with fast-set eyes we watch'd"
7860,ARGUMENT,"Charybdis; meantime, Scylla from the bark"
7861,ARGUMENT,"Caught six away, the bravest of my friends."
7862,ARGUMENT,"With eyes, that moment, on my ship and crew                      290"
7863,ARGUMENT,"Retorted, I beheld the legs and arms"
7864,ARGUMENT,Of those whom she uplifted in the air;
7865,ARGUMENT,"On me they call'd, my name, the last, last time"
7866,ARGUMENT,"Pronouncing then, in agony of heart."
7867,ARGUMENT,As when from some bold point among the rocks
7868,ARGUMENT,"The angler, with his taper rod in hand,"
7869,ARGUMENT,"Casts forth his bait to snare the smaller fry,"
7870,ARGUMENT,"He swings away remote his guarded line,[56]"
7871,ARGUMENT,"Then jerks his gasping prey forth from the Deep,"
7872,ARGUMENT,"So Scylla them raised gasping to the rock,                       300"
7873,ARGUMENT,And at her cavern's mouth devour'd them loud-
7874,ARGUMENT,"Shrieking, and stretching forth to me their arms"
7875,ARGUMENT,In sign of hopeless mis'ry. Ne'er beheld
7876,ARGUMENT,"These eyes in all the seas that I have roam'd,"
7877,ARGUMENT,"A sight so piteous, nor in all my toils."
7878,ARGUMENT,"From Scylla and Charybdis dire escaped,"
7879,ARGUMENT,We reach'd the noble island of the Sun
7880,ARGUMENT,"Ere long, where bright Hyperion's beauteous herds"
7881,ARGUMENT,"Broad-fronted grazed, and his well-batten'd flocks."
7882,ARGUMENT,"I, in the bark and on the sea, the voice                         310"
7883,ARGUMENT,"Of oxen bellowing in hovels heard,"
7884,ARGUMENT,And of loud-bleating sheep; then dropp'd the word
7885,ARGUMENT,"Into my memory of the sightless Seer,"
7886,ARGUMENT,"Theban Tiresias, and the caution strict"
7887,ARGUMENT,"Of Circe, my Ææan monitress,"
7888,ARGUMENT,Who with such force had caution'd me to avoid
7889,ARGUMENT,"The island of the Sun, joy of mankind."
7890,ARGUMENT,"Thus then to my companions, sad, I spake."
7891,ARGUMENT,"Hear ye, my friends! although long time distress'd,"
7892,ARGUMENT,The words prophetic of the Theban seer                           320
7893,ARGUMENT,"And of Ææan Circe, whose advice"
7894,ARGUMENT,Was oft repeated to me to avoid
7895,ARGUMENT,"This island of the Sun, joy of mankind."
7896,ARGUMENT,"There, said the Goddess, dread your heaviest woes,"
7897,ARGUMENT,"Pass the isle, therefore, scudding swift away."
7898,ARGUMENT,"I ceased; they me with consternation heard,"
7899,ARGUMENT,And harshly thus Eurylochus replied.
7900,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, ruthless Chief! no toils impair"
7901,ARGUMENT,"Thy strength, of senseless iron thou art form'd,"
7902,ARGUMENT,Who thy companions weary and o'erwatch'd                         330
7903,ARGUMENT,"Forbidd'st to disembark on this fair isle,"
7904,ARGUMENT,"Where now, at last, we might with ease regale."
7905,ARGUMENT,"Thou, rash, command'st us, leaving it afar,"
7906,ARGUMENT,To roam all night the Ocean's dreary waste;
7907,ARGUMENT,"But winds to ships injurious spring by night,"
7908,ARGUMENT,And how shall we escape a dreadful death
7909,ARGUMENT,"If, chance, a sudden gust from South arise"
7910,ARGUMENT,"Or stormy West, that dash in pieces oft"
7911,ARGUMENT,"The vessel, even in the Gods' despight?"
7912,ARGUMENT,"Prepare we rather now, as night enjoins,                         340"
7913,ARGUMENT,"Our evening fare beside the sable bark,"
7914,ARGUMENT,In which at peep of day we may again
7915,ARGUMENT,Launch forth secure into the boundless flood.
7916,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd, whom all applauded. Then I knew"
7917,ARGUMENT,That sorrow by the will of adverse heav'n
7918,ARGUMENT,"Approach'd, and in wing'd accents thus replied."
7919,ARGUMENT,"I suffer force, Eurylochus! and yield"
7920,ARGUMENT,"O'er-ruled by numbers. Come, then, swear ye all"
7921,ARGUMENT,"A solemn oath, that should we find an herd"
7922,ARGUMENT,"Or num'rous flock, none here shall either sheep                  350"
7923,ARGUMENT,"Or bullock slay, by appetite profane"
7924,ARGUMENT,"Seduced, but shall the viands eat content"
7925,ARGUMENT,Which from immortal Circe we received.
7926,ARGUMENT,I spake; they readily a solemn oath
7927,ARGUMENT,"Sware all, and when their oath was fully sworn,"
7928,ARGUMENT,Within a creek where a fresh fountain rose
7929,ARGUMENT,"They moor'd the bark, and, issuing, began"
7930,ARGUMENT,Brisk preparation of their evening cheer.
7931,ARGUMENT,But when nor hunger now nor thirst remain'd
7932,ARGUMENT,"Unsated, recollecting, then, their friends                       360"
7933,ARGUMENT,"By Scylla seized and at her cave devour'd,"
7934,ARGUMENT,"They mourn'd, nor ceased to mourn them, till they slept."
7935,ARGUMENT,"The night's third portion come, when now the stars"
7936,ARGUMENT,"Had travers'd the mid-sky, cloud-gath'rer Jove"
7937,ARGUMENT,"Call'd forth a vehement wind with tempest charged,"
7938,ARGUMENT,Menacing earth and sea with pitchy clouds
7939,ARGUMENT,"Tremendous, and the night fell dark from heav'n."
7940,ARGUMENT,"But when Aurora, daughter of the day,"
7941,ARGUMENT,"Look'd rosy forth, we haled, drawn inland more,"
7942,ARGUMENT,"Our bark into a grot, where nymphs were wont                     370"
7943,ARGUMENT,"Graceful to tread the dance, or to repose."
7944,ARGUMENT,"Convening there my friends, I thus began."
7945,ARGUMENT,"My friends! food fails us not, but bread is yet"
7946,ARGUMENT,"And wine on board. Abstain we from the herds,"
7947,ARGUMENT,Lest harm ensue; for ye behold the flocks
7948,ARGUMENT,"And herds of a most potent God, the Sun!"
7949,ARGUMENT,Whose eye and watchful ear none may elude.
7950,ARGUMENT,"So saying, I sway'd the gen'rous minds of all."
7951,ARGUMENT,"A month complete the South wind ceaseless blew,"
7952,ARGUMENT,"Nor other wind blew next, save East and South,                   380"
7953,ARGUMENT,"Yet they, while neither food nor rosy wine"
7954,ARGUMENT,"Fail'd them, the herds harm'd not, through fear to die."
7955,ARGUMENT,"But, our provisions failing, they employed"
7956,ARGUMENT,"Whole days in search of food, snaring with hooks"
7957,ARGUMENT,"Birds, fishes, of what kind soe'er they might."
7958,ARGUMENT,By famine urged. I solitary roam'd
7959,ARGUMENT,"Meantime the isle, seeking by pray'r to move"
7960,ARGUMENT,Some God to shew us a deliv'rance thence.
7961,ARGUMENT,"When, roving thus the isle, I had at length"
7962,ARGUMENT,"Left all my crew remote, laving my hands                         390"
7963,ARGUMENT,"Where shelter warm I found from the rude blast,"
7964,ARGUMENT,I supplicated ev'ry Pow'r above;
7965,ARGUMENT,But they my pray'rs answer'd with slumbers soft
7966,ARGUMENT,"Shed o'er my eyes, and with pernicious art"
7967,ARGUMENT,"Eurylochus, the while, my friends harangued."
7968,ARGUMENT,"My friends! afflicted as ye are, yet hear"
7969,ARGUMENT,"A fellow-suff'rer. Death, however caused,"
7970,ARGUMENT,"Abhorrence moves in miserable man,"
7971,ARGUMENT,But death by famine is a fate of all
7972,ARGUMENT,Most to be fear'd. Come--let us hither drive                     400
7973,ARGUMENT,And sacrifice to the Immortal Pow'rs
7974,ARGUMENT,"The best of all the oxen of the Sun,"
7975,ARGUMENT,Resolving thus--that soon as we shall reach
7976,ARGUMENT,"Our native Ithaca, we will erect"
7977,ARGUMENT,"To bright Hyperion an illustrious fane,"
7978,ARGUMENT,Which with magnificent and num'rous gifts
7979,ARGUMENT,We will enrich. But should he chuse to sink
7980,ARGUMENT,"Our vessel, for his stately beeves incensed,"
7981,ARGUMENT,"And should, with him, all heav'n conspire our death,"
7982,ARGUMENT,"I rather had with open mouth, at once,                           410"
7983,ARGUMENT,"Meeting the billows, perish, than by slow"
7984,ARGUMENT,And pining waste here in this desert isle.
7985,ARGUMENT,"So spake Eurylochus, whom all approved."
7986,ARGUMENT,"Then, driving all the fattest of the herd"
7987,ARGUMENT,"Few paces only, (for the sacred beeves"
7988,ARGUMENT,Grazed rarely distant from the bark) they stood
7989,ARGUMENT,"Compassing them around, and, grasping each"
7990,ARGUMENT,"Green foliage newly pluck'd from saplings tall,"
7991,ARGUMENT,(For barley none in all our bark remain'd)
7992,ARGUMENT,"Worshipp'd the Gods in pray'r. Pray'r made, they slew"
7993,ARGUMENT,"And flay'd them, and the thighs with double fat                  421"
7994,ARGUMENT,"Investing, spread them o'er with slices crude."
7995,ARGUMENT,No wine had they with which to consecrate
7996,ARGUMENT,"The blazing rites, but with libation poor"
7997,ARGUMENT,Of water hallow'd the interior parts.
7998,ARGUMENT,"Now, when the thighs were burnt, and each had shared"
7999,ARGUMENT,"His portion of the maw, and when the rest"
8000,ARGUMENT,"All-slash'd and scored hung roasting at the fire,"
8001,ARGUMENT,"Sleep, in that moment, suddenly my eyes"
8002,ARGUMENT,"Forsaking, to the shore I bent my way.                           430"
8003,ARGUMENT,"But ere the station of our bark I reach'd,"
8004,ARGUMENT,The sav'ry steam greeted me. At the scent
8005,ARGUMENT,"I wept aloud, and to the Gods exclaim'd."
8006,ARGUMENT,"Oh Jupiter, and all ye Pow'rs above!"
8007,ARGUMENT,With cruel sleep and fatal ye have lull'd
8008,ARGUMENT,"My cares to rest, such horrible offence"
8009,ARGUMENT,Meantime my rash companions have devised.
8010,ARGUMENT,"Then, flew long-stoled Lampetia to the Sun"
8011,ARGUMENT,"At once with tidings of his slaughter'd beeves,"
8012,ARGUMENT,"And he, incensed, the Immortals thus address'd.                  440"
8013,ARGUMENT,"Jove, and ye everlasting Pow'rs divine!"
8014,ARGUMENT,Avenge me instant on the crew profane
8015,ARGUMENT,Of Laertiades; Ulysses' friends
8016,ARGUMENT,"Have dared to slay my beeves, which I with joy"
8017,ARGUMENT,"Beheld, both when I climb'd the starry heav'ns,"
8018,ARGUMENT,"And when to earth I sloped my ""westring wheels,"""
8019,ARGUMENT,But if they yield me not amercement due
8020,ARGUMENT,"And honourable for my loss, to Hell"
8021,ARGUMENT,I will descend and give the ghosts my beams.
8022,ARGUMENT,"Then, thus the cloud-assembler God replied.                    450"
8023,ARGUMENT,"Sun! shine thou still on the Immortal Pow'rs,"
8024,ARGUMENT,"And on the teeming earth, frail man's abode."
8025,ARGUMENT,My candent bolts can in a moment reach
8026,ARGUMENT,And split their flying bark in the mid-sea.
8027,ARGUMENT,"These things Calypso told me, taught, herself,"
8028,ARGUMENT,"By herald Hermes, as she oft affirm'd."
8029,ARGUMENT,"But when, descending to the shore, I reach'd"
8030,ARGUMENT,"At length my bark, with aspect stern and tone"
8031,ARGUMENT,"I reprimanded them, yet no redress"
8032,ARGUMENT,"Could frame, or remedy--the beeves were dead.                    460"
8033,ARGUMENT,Soon follow'd signs portentous sent from heav'n.
8034,ARGUMENT,"The skins all crept, and on the spits the flesh"
8035,ARGUMENT,"Both roast and raw bellow'd, as with the voice"
8036,ARGUMENT,Of living beeves. Thus my devoted friends
8037,ARGUMENT,"Driving the fattest oxen of the Sun,"
8038,ARGUMENT,Feasted six days entire; but when the sev'nth
8039,ARGUMENT,"By mandate of Saturnian Jove appeared,"
8040,ARGUMENT,"The storm then ceased to rage, and we, again"
8041,ARGUMENT,"Embarking, launch'd our galley, rear'd the mast,"
8042,ARGUMENT,And gave our unfurl'd canvas to the wind.                        470
8043,ARGUMENT,"The island left afar, and other land"
8044,ARGUMENT,"Appearing none, but sky alone and sea,"
8045,ARGUMENT,Right o'er the hollow bark Saturnian Jove
8046,ARGUMENT,"Hung a cærulean cloud, dark'ning the Deep."
8047,ARGUMENT,"Not long my vessel ran, for, blowing wild,"
8048,ARGUMENT,Now came shrill Zephyrus; a stormy gust
8049,ARGUMENT,Snapp'd sheer the shrouds on both sides; backward fell
8050,ARGUMENT,"The mast, and with loose tackle strew'd the hold;"
8051,ARGUMENT,"Striking the pilot in the stern, it crush'd"
8052,ARGUMENT,His scull together; he a diver's plunge                          480
8053,ARGUMENT,"Made downward, and his noble spirit fled."
8054,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, Jove thund'ring, hurl'd into the ship"
8055,ARGUMENT,"His bolts; she, smitten by the fires of Jove,"
8056,ARGUMENT,"Quaked all her length; with sulphur fill'd she reek'd,"
8057,ARGUMENT,And o'er her sides headlong my people plunged
8058,ARGUMENT,"Like sea-mews, interdicted by that stroke"
8059,ARGUMENT,Of wrath divine to hope their country more.
8060,ARGUMENT,"But I, the vessel still paced to and fro,"
8061,ARGUMENT,"Till, fever'd by the boist'rous waves, her sides"
8062,ARGUMENT,Forsook the keel now left to float alone.                        490
8063,ARGUMENT,"Snapp'd where it join'd the keel the mast had fall'n,"
8064,ARGUMENT,"But fell encircled with a leathern brace,"
8065,ARGUMENT,Which it retain'd; binding with this the mast
8066,ARGUMENT,"And keel together, on them both I sat,"
8067,ARGUMENT,Borne helpless onward by the dreadful gale.
8068,ARGUMENT,"And now the West subsided, and the South"
8069,ARGUMENT,"Arose instead, with mis'ry charged for me,"
8070,ARGUMENT,That I might measure back my course again
8071,ARGUMENT,"To dire Charybdis. All night long I drove,"
8072,ARGUMENT,"And when the sun arose, at Scylla's rock                         500"
8073,ARGUMENT,"Once more, and at Charybdis' gulph arrived."
8074,ARGUMENT,It was the time when she absorb'd profound
8075,ARGUMENT,"The briny flood, but by a wave upborne"
8076,ARGUMENT,I seized the branches fast of the wild-fig.[57]
8077,ARGUMENT,"To which, bat-like, I clung; yet where to fix"
8078,ARGUMENT,"My foot secure found not, or where to ascend,"
8079,ARGUMENT,"For distant lay the roots, and distant shot"
8080,ARGUMENT,"The largest arms erect into the air,"
8081,ARGUMENT,O'ershadowing all Charybdis; therefore hard
8082,ARGUMENT,"I clench'd the boughs, till she disgorg'd again                  510"
8083,ARGUMENT,Both keel and mast. Not undesired by me
8084,ARGUMENT,"They came, though late; for at what hour the judge,"
8085,ARGUMENT,After decision made of num'rous strifes[58]
8086,ARGUMENT,"Between young candidates for honour, leaves"
8087,ARGUMENT,"The forum for refreshment' sake at home,"
8088,ARGUMENT,Then was it that the mast and keel emerged.
8089,ARGUMENT,"Deliver'd to a voluntary fall,"
8090,ARGUMENT,"Fast by those beams I dash'd into the flood,"
8091,ARGUMENT,"And seated on them both, with oary palms"
8092,ARGUMENT,Impell'd them; nor the Sire of Gods and men                      520
8093,ARGUMENT,"Permitted Scylla to discern me more,"
8094,ARGUMENT,Else had I perish'd by her fangs at last.
8095,ARGUMENT,"Nine days I floated thence, and, on the tenth"
8096,ARGUMENT,"Dark night, the Gods convey'd me to the isle"
8097,ARGUMENT,"Ogygia, habitation of divine"
8098,ARGUMENT,"Calypso, by whose hospitable aid"
8099,ARGUMENT,"And assiduity, my strength revived."
8100,ARGUMENT,But wherefore this? ye have already learn'd
8101,ARGUMENT,"That hist'ry, thou and thy illustrious spouse;"
8102,ARGUMENT,"I told it yesterday, and hate a tale                             530"

8129,ARGUMENT,"him, and they concert together the means of destroying the suitors. The"
8130,ARGUMENT,"Goddess then repairs to Sparta to call thence Telemachus, and Ulysses, by"
8131,ARGUMENT,"her aid disguised like a beggar, proceeds towards the cottage of Eumæus."
8132,ARGUMENT,
8133,ARGUMENT,
8134,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd; the whole assembly silent sat,"
8135,ARGUMENT,Charm'd into ecstacy with his discourse
8136,ARGUMENT,"Throughout the twilight hall. Then, thus the King."
8137,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, since beneath my brazen dome"
8138,ARGUMENT,"Sublime thou hast arrived, like woes, I trust,"
8139,ARGUMENT,Thou shalt not in thy voyage hence sustain
8140,ARGUMENT,"By tempests tost, though much to woe inured."
8141,ARGUMENT,"To you, who daily in my presence quaff"
8142,ARGUMENT,Your princely meed of gen'rous wine and hear
8143,ARGUMENT,"The sacred bard, my pleasure, thus I speak.                       10"
8144,ARGUMENT,"The robes, wrought gold, and all the other gifts"
8145,ARGUMENT,"To this our guest, by the Phæacian Chiefs"
8146,ARGUMENT,Brought hither in the sumptuous coffer lie.
8147,ARGUMENT,"But come--present ye to the stranger, each,"
8148,ARGUMENT,"An ample tripod also, with a vase"
8149,ARGUMENT,"Of smaller size, for which we will be paid"
8150,ARGUMENT,By public impost; for the charge of all
8151,ARGUMENT,Excessive were by one alone defray'd.
8152,ARGUMENT,"So spake Alcinoüs, and his counsel pleased;"
8153,ARGUMENT,"Then, all retiring, sought repose at home.                        20"
8154,ARGUMENT,"But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn,"
8155,ARGUMENT,"Look'd rosy forth, each hasted to the bark"
8156,ARGUMENT,"With his illustrious present, which the might"
8157,ARGUMENT,"Of King Alcinoüs, who himself her sides"
8158,ARGUMENT,"Ascended, safe beneath the seats bestowed,"
8159,ARGUMENT,"Lest it should harm or hinder, while he toil'd"
8160,ARGUMENT,"In rowing, some Phæacian of the crew."
8161,ARGUMENT,"The palace of Alcinoüs seeking next,"
8162,ARGUMENT,"Together, they prepared a new regale."
8163,ARGUMENT,"For them, in sacrifice, the sacred might[59]                    30"
8164,ARGUMENT,Of King Alcinoüs slew an ox to Jove
8165,ARGUMENT,"Saturnian, cloud-girt governor of all."
8166,ARGUMENT,"The thighs with fire prepared, all glad partook"
8167,ARGUMENT,"The noble feast; meantime, the bard divine"
8168,ARGUMENT,"Sang, sweet Demodocus, the people's joy."
8169,ARGUMENT,But oft Ulysses to the radiant sun
8170,ARGUMENT,"Turn'd wistful eyes, anxious for his decline,"
8171,ARGUMENT,"Nor longer, now, patient of dull delay."
8172,ARGUMENT,As when some hungry swain whose sable beeves
8173,ARGUMENT,Have through the fallow dragg'd his pond'rous plow                40
8174,ARGUMENT,"All day, the setting sun views with delight"
8175,ARGUMENT,"For supper' sake, which with tir'd feet he seeks,"
8176,ARGUMENT,So welcome to Ulysses' eyes appear'd
8177,ARGUMENT,"The sun-set of that eve; directing, then,"
8178,ARGUMENT,"His speech to maritime Phæacia's sons,"
8179,ARGUMENT,"But to Alcinoüs chiefly, thus he said."
8180,ARGUMENT,"Alcinoüs, o'er Phæacia's realm supreme!"
8181,ARGUMENT,"Libation made, dismiss ye me in peace,"
8182,ARGUMENT,"And farewell all! for what I wish'd, I have,"
8183,ARGUMENT,"Conductors hence, and honourable gifts                            50"
8184,ARGUMENT,With which heav'n prosper me! and may the Gods
8185,ARGUMENT,"Vouchsafe to me, at my return, to find"
8186,ARGUMENT,"All safe, my spotless consort and my friends!"
8187,ARGUMENT,"May ye, whom here I leave, gladden your wives"
8188,ARGUMENT,"And see your children blest, and may the pow'rs"
8189,ARGUMENT,"Immortal with all good enrich you all,"
8190,ARGUMENT,And from calamity preserve the land!
8191,ARGUMENT,"He ended, they unanimous, his speech"
8192,ARGUMENT,"Applauded loud, and bade dismiss the guest"
8193,ARGUMENT,Who had so wisely spoken and so well.                             60
8194,ARGUMENT,Then thus Alcinoüs to his herald spake.
8195,ARGUMENT,"Pontonoüs! charging high the beaker, bear"
8196,ARGUMENT,"To ev'ry guest beneath our roof the wine,"
8197,ARGUMENT,"That, pray'r preferr'd to the eternal Sire,"
8198,ARGUMENT,We may dismiss our inmate to his home.
8199,ARGUMENT,"Then, bore Pontonoüs to ev'ry guest"
8200,ARGUMENT,"The brimming cup; they, where they sat, perform'd"
8201,ARGUMENT,Libation due; but the illustrious Chief
8202,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, from his seat arising, placed"
8203,ARGUMENT,"A massy goblet in Areta's hand,                                   70"
8204,ARGUMENT,"To whom in accents wing'd, grateful, he said."
8205,ARGUMENT,"Farewell, O Queen, a long farewell, till age"
8206,ARGUMENT,"Arrive, and death, the appointed lot of all!"
8207,ARGUMENT,"I go; but be this people, and the King"
8208,ARGUMENT,"Alcinoüs, and thy progeny, thy joy"
8209,ARGUMENT,Yet many a year beneath this glorious roof!
8210,ARGUMENT,"So saying, the Hero through the palace-gate"
8211,ARGUMENT,"Issued, whom, by Alcinoüs' command,"
8212,ARGUMENT,The royal herald to his vessel led.
8213,ARGUMENT,Three maidens also of Areta's train                               80
8214,ARGUMENT,"His steps attended; one, the robe well-bleach'd"
8215,ARGUMENT,"And tunic bore; the corded coffer, one;"
8216,ARGUMENT,"And food the third, with wine of crimson hue."
8217,ARGUMENT,"Arriving where the galley rode, each gave"
8218,ARGUMENT,"Her charge to some brave mariner on board,"
8219,ARGUMENT,And all was safely stow'd. Meantime were spread
8220,ARGUMENT,"Linen and arras on the deck astern,"
8221,ARGUMENT,For his secure repose. And now the Chief
8222,ARGUMENT,"Himself embarking, silent lay'd him down."
8223,ARGUMENT,"Then, ev'ry rower to his bench repair'd;                          90"
8224,ARGUMENT,They drew the loosen'd cable from its hold
8225,ARGUMENT,"In the drill'd rock, and, resupine, at once"
8226,ARGUMENT,With lusty strokes upturn'd the flashing waves.
8227,ARGUMENT,"_His_ eye-lids, soon, sleep, falling as a dew,"
8228,ARGUMENT,"Closed fast, death's simular, in sight the same."
8229,ARGUMENT,"She, as four harness'd stallions o'er the plain"
8230,ARGUMENT,"Shooting together at the scourge's stroke,"
8231,ARGUMENT,"Toss high their manes, and rapid scour along,"
8232,ARGUMENT,"So mounted she the waves, while dark the flood"
8233,ARGUMENT,Roll'd after her of the resounding Deep.                         100
8234,ARGUMENT,"Steady she ran and safe, passing in speed"
8235,ARGUMENT,"The falcon, swiftest of the fowls of heav'n;"
8236,ARGUMENT,"With such rapidity she cut the waves,"
8237,ARGUMENT,An hero bearing like the Gods above
8238,ARGUMENT,"In wisdom, one familiar long with woe"
8239,ARGUMENT,"In fight sustain'd, and on the perilous flood,"
8240,ARGUMENT,"Though sleeping now serenely, and resign'd"
8241,ARGUMENT,To sweet oblivion of all sorrow past.
8242,ARGUMENT,"The brightest star of heav'n, precursor chief"
8243,ARGUMENT,"Of day-spring, now arose, when at the isle                       110"
8244,ARGUMENT,(Her voyage soon perform'd) the bark arrived.
8245,ARGUMENT,There is a port sacred in Ithaca
8246,ARGUMENT,"To Phorcys, hoary ancient of the Deep,"
8247,ARGUMENT,"Form'd by converging shores, prominent both"
8248,ARGUMENT,"And both abrupt, which from the spacious bay"
8249,ARGUMENT,"Exclude all boist'rous winds; within it, ships"
8250,ARGUMENT,(The port once gain'd) uncabled ride secure.
8251,ARGUMENT,"An olive, at the haven's head, expands"
8252,ARGUMENT,"Her branches wide, near to a pleasant cave"
8253,ARGUMENT,"Umbrageous, to the nymphs devoted named                          120"
8254,ARGUMENT,The Naiads. In that cave beakers of stone
8255,ARGUMENT,And jars are seen; bees lodge their honey there;
8256,ARGUMENT,"And there, on slender spindles of the rock"
8257,ARGUMENT,The nymphs of rivers weave their wond'rous robes.
8258,ARGUMENT,"Perennial springs water it, and it shows"
8259,ARGUMENT,A twofold entrance; ingress one affords
8260,ARGUMENT,"To mortal man, which Northward looks direct,"
8261,ARGUMENT,But holier is the Southern far; by that
8262,ARGUMENT,"No mortal enters, but the Gods alone."
8263,ARGUMENT,"Familiar with that port before, they push'd                      130"
8264,ARGUMENT,"The vessel in; she, rapid, plow'd the sands"
8265,ARGUMENT,"With half her keel, such rowers urged her on."
8266,ARGUMENT,"Descending from the well-bench'd bark ashore,"
8267,ARGUMENT,"They lifted forth Ulysses first, with all"
8268,ARGUMENT,"His splendid couch complete, then, lay'd him down"
8269,ARGUMENT,Still wrapt in balmy slumber on the sands.
8270,ARGUMENT,"His treasures, next, by the Phæacian Chiefs"
8271,ARGUMENT,At his departure given him as the meed
8272,ARGUMENT,"Due to his wisdom, at the olive's foot"
8273,ARGUMENT,"They heap'd, without the road, lest, while he slept              140"
8274,ARGUMENT,Some passing traveller should rifle them.
8275,ARGUMENT,Then homeward thence they sped. Nor Ocean's God
8276,ARGUMENT,His threats forgot denounced against divine
8277,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, but with Jove thus first advised."
8278,ARGUMENT,Eternal Sire! I shall no longer share
8279,ARGUMENT,"Respect and reverence among the Gods,"
8280,ARGUMENT,"Since, now, Phæacia's mortal race have ceas'd"
8281,ARGUMENT,"To honour me, though from myself derived."
8282,ARGUMENT,"It was my purpose, that by many an ill"
8283,ARGUMENT,"Harass'd, Ulysses should have reach'd his home,                  150"
8284,ARGUMENT,"Although to intercept him, whose return"
8285,ARGUMENT,"Thyself had promis'd, ne'er was my intent."
8286,ARGUMENT,But him fast-sleeping swiftly o'er the waves
8287,ARGUMENT,"They have conducted, and have set him down"
8288,ARGUMENT,"In Ithaca, with countless gifts enrich'd,"
8289,ARGUMENT,"With brass, and tissued raiment, and with gold;"
8290,ARGUMENT,Much treasure! more than he had home convey'd
8291,ARGUMENT,Even had he arrived with all his share
8292,ARGUMENT,Allotted to him of the spoils of Troy.
8293,ARGUMENT,To whom the cloud-assembler God replied.                       160
8294,ARGUMENT,"What hast thou spoken, Shaker of the shores,"
8295,ARGUMENT,Wide-ruling Neptune? Fear not; thee the Gods
8296,ARGUMENT,Will ne'er despise; dangerous were the deed
8297,ARGUMENT,To cast dishonour on a God by birth
8298,ARGUMENT,"More ancient, and more potent far than they."
8299,ARGUMENT,"But if, profanely rash, a mortal man"
8300,ARGUMENT,"Should dare to slight thee, to avenge the wrong"
8301,ARGUMENT,Some future day is ever in thy pow'r.
8302,ARGUMENT,"Accomplish all thy pleasure, thou art free."
8303,ARGUMENT,"Him answer'd, then, the Shaker of the shores.                  170"
8304,ARGUMENT,Jove cloud-enthroned! that pleasure I would soon
8305,ARGUMENT,"Perform, as thou hast said, but that I watch"
8306,ARGUMENT,"Thy mind continual, fearful to offend."
8307,ARGUMENT,"My purpose is, now to destroy amid"
8308,ARGUMENT,"The dreary Deep yon fair Phæacian bark,"
8309,ARGUMENT,Return'd from safe conveyance of her freight;
8310,ARGUMENT,"So shall they waft such wand'rers home no more,"
8311,ARGUMENT,"And she shall hide their city, to a rock"
8312,ARGUMENT,Transform'd of mountainous o'ershadowing size.
8313,ARGUMENT,"Him, then, Jove answer'd, gath'rer of the clouds.              180"
8314,ARGUMENT,"Perform it, O my brother, and the deed"
8315,ARGUMENT,"Thus done, shall best be done--What time the people"
8316,ARGUMENT,"Shall from the city her approach descry,"
8317,ARGUMENT,"Fix her to stone transform'd, but still in shape"
8318,ARGUMENT,"A gallant bark, near to the coast, that all"
8319,ARGUMENT,"May wonder, seeing her transform'd to stone"
8320,ARGUMENT,Of size to hide their city from the view.
8321,ARGUMENT,"These words once heard, the Shaker of the shores"
8322,ARGUMENT,"Instant to Scheria, maritime abode"
8323,ARGUMENT,"Of the Phæacians, went. Arrived, he watch'd.                     190"
8324,ARGUMENT,"And now the flying bark full near approach'd,"
8325,ARGUMENT,"When Neptune, meeting her, with out-spread palm"
8326,ARGUMENT,"Depress'd her at a stroke, and she became"
8327,ARGUMENT,Deep-rooted stone. Then Neptune went his way.
8328,ARGUMENT,Phæacia's ship-ennobled sons meantime
8329,ARGUMENT,"Conferring stood, and thus, in accents wing'd,"
8330,ARGUMENT,Th' amazed spectator to his fellow spake.
8331,ARGUMENT,Ah! who hath sudden check'd the vessel's course
8332,ARGUMENT,Homeward? this moment she was all in view.
8333,ARGUMENT,"Thus they, unconscious of the cause, to whom                   200"
8334,ARGUMENT,"Alcinoüs, instructing them, replied."
8335,ARGUMENT,Ye Gods! a prophecy now strikes my mind
8336,ARGUMENT,"With force, my father's. He was wont to say--"
8337,ARGUMENT,"Neptune resents it, that we safe conduct"
8338,ARGUMENT,Natives of ev'ry region to their home.
8339,ARGUMENT,"He also spake, prophetic, of a day"
8340,ARGUMENT,"When a Phæacian gallant bark, return'd"
8341,ARGUMENT,"After conveyance of a stranger hence,"
8342,ARGUMENT,"Should perish in the dreary Deep, and changed"
8343,ARGUMENT,"To a huge mountain, cover all the town.                          210"
8344,ARGUMENT,"So spake my father, all whose words we see"
8345,ARGUMENT,"This day fulfill'd. Thus, therefore, act we all"
8346,ARGUMENT,Unanimous; henceforth no longer bear
8347,ARGUMENT,"The stranger home, when such shall here arrive;"
8348,ARGUMENT,"And we will sacrifice, without delay,"
8349,ARGUMENT,"Twelve chosen bulls to Neptune, if, perchance,"
8350,ARGUMENT,"He will commiserate us, and forbear"
8351,ARGUMENT,To hide our town behind a mountain's height.
8352,ARGUMENT,"He spake, they, terrified, the bulls prepared."
8353,ARGUMENT,Thus all Phæacia's Senators and Chiefs                           220
8354,ARGUMENT,"His altar compassing, in pray'r adored"
8355,ARGUMENT,"The Ocean's God. Meantime, Ulysses woke,"
8356,ARGUMENT,Unconscious where; stretch'd on his native soil
8357,ARGUMENT,"He lay, and knew it not, long-time exiled."
8358,ARGUMENT,"For Pallas, progeny of Jove, a cloud"
8359,ARGUMENT,"Drew dense around him, that, ere yet agnized"
8360,ARGUMENT,"By others, he might wisdom learn from her,"
8361,ARGUMENT,"Neither to citizens, nor yet to friends"
8362,ARGUMENT,"Reveal'd, nor even to his own espoused,"
8363,ARGUMENT,"Till, first, he should avenge complete his wrongs                230"
8364,ARGUMENT,Domestic from those suitors proud sustained.
8365,ARGUMENT,"All objects, therefore, in the Hero's eyes"
8366,ARGUMENT,"Seem'd alien, foot-paths long, commodious ports,"
8367,ARGUMENT,"Heav'n-climbing rocks, and trees of amplest growth."
8368,ARGUMENT,"Arising, fixt he stood, his native soil"
8369,ARGUMENT,"Contemplating, till with expanded palms"
8370,ARGUMENT,"Both thighs he smote, and, plaintive, thus began."
8371,ARGUMENT,Ah me! what mortal race inhabits here?
8372,ARGUMENT,"Rude are they, contumacious and unjust,"
8373,ARGUMENT,"Or hospitable, and who fear the Gods?                            240"
8374,ARGUMENT,Where now shall I secrete these num'rous stores?
8375,ARGUMENT,"Where wander I, myself? I would that still"
8376,ARGUMENT,"Phæacians own'd them, and I had arrived"
8377,ARGUMENT,In the dominions of some other King
8378,ARGUMENT,"Magnanimous, who would have entertain'd"
8379,ARGUMENT,And sent me to my native home secure!
8380,ARGUMENT,"Now, neither know I where to place my wealth,"
8381,ARGUMENT,"Nor can I leave it here, lest it become"
8382,ARGUMENT,Another's prey. Alas! Phæacia's Chiefs
8383,ARGUMENT,"Not altogether wise I deem or just,                              250"
8384,ARGUMENT,"Who have misplaced me in another land,"
8385,ARGUMENT,Promis'd to bear me to the pleasant shores
8386,ARGUMENT,"Of Ithaca, but have not so perform'd."
8387,ARGUMENT,"Jove, guardian of the suppliant's rights, who all"
8388,ARGUMENT,"Transgressors marks, and punishes all wrong,"
8389,ARGUMENT,Avenge me on the treach'rous race!--but hold--
8390,ARGUMENT,"I will revise my stores, so shall I know"
8391,ARGUMENT,If they have left me here of aught despoiled.
8392,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he number'd carefully the gold,"
8393,ARGUMENT,"The vases, tripods bright, and tissued robes,                    260"
8394,ARGUMENT,But nothing miss'd of all. Then he bewail'd
8395,ARGUMENT,"His native isle, with pensive steps and slow"
8396,ARGUMENT,"Pacing the border of the billowy flood,"
8397,ARGUMENT,"Forlorn; but while he wept, Pallas approach'd,"
8398,ARGUMENT,"In form a shepherd stripling, girlish fair"
8399,ARGUMENT,"In feature, such as are the sons of Kings;"
8400,ARGUMENT,A sumptuous mantle o'er his shoulders hung
8401,ARGUMENT,"Twice-folded, sandals his nice feet upbore,"
8402,ARGUMENT,And a smooth javelin glitter'd in his hand.
8403,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, joyful at the sight, his steps                          270"
8404,ARGUMENT,"Turn'd brisk toward her, whom he thus address'd."
8405,ARGUMENT,"Sweet youth! since thee, of all mankind, I first"
8406,ARGUMENT,"Encounter in this land unknown, all hail!"
8407,ARGUMENT,Come not with purposes of harm to me!
8408,ARGUMENT,"These save, and save me also. I prefer"
8409,ARGUMENT,"To thee, as to some God, my pray'r, and clasp"
8410,ARGUMENT,"Thy knees a suppliant. Say, and tell me true,"
8411,ARGUMENT,What land? what people? who inhabit here?
8412,ARGUMENT,"Is this some isle delightful, or a shore"
8413,ARGUMENT,Of fruitful main-land sloping to the sea?                        280
8414,ARGUMENT,"Then Pallas, thus, Goddess cærulean-eyed."
8415,ARGUMENT,"Stranger! thou sure art simple, or hast dwelt"
8416,ARGUMENT,"Far distant hence, if of this land thou ask."
8417,ARGUMENT,"It is not, trust me, of so little note,"
8418,ARGUMENT,"But known to many, both to those who dwell"
8419,ARGUMENT,"Toward the sun-rise, and to others placed"
8420,ARGUMENT,"Behind it, distant in the dusky West."
8421,ARGUMENT,"Rugged it is, not yielding level course"
8422,ARGUMENT,"To the swift steed, and yet no barren spot,"
8423,ARGUMENT,"However small, but rich in wheat and wine;                       290"
8424,ARGUMENT,"Nor wants it rain or fertilising dew,"
8425,ARGUMENT,"But pasture green to goats and beeves affords,"
8426,ARGUMENT,"Trees of all kinds, and fountains never dry."
8427,ARGUMENT,"Ithaca therefore, stranger, is a name"
8428,ARGUMENT,"Known ev'n at Troy, a city, by report,"
8429,ARGUMENT,At no small distance from Achaia's shore.
8430,ARGUMENT,"The Goddess ceased; then, toil-enduring Chief"
8431,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, happy in his native land,"
8432,ARGUMENT,"(So taught by Pallas, progeny of Jove)"
8433,ARGUMENT,"In accents wing'd her answ'ring, utter'd prompt                  300"
8434,ARGUMENT,"Not truth, but figments to truth opposite,"
8435,ARGUMENT,"For guile, in him, stood never at a pause."
8436,ARGUMENT,"O'er yonder flood, even in spacious Crete[60]"
8437,ARGUMENT,"I heard of Ithaca, where now, it seems,"
8438,ARGUMENT,"I have, myself, with these my stores arrived;"
8439,ARGUMENT,"Not richer stores than, flying thence, I left"
8440,ARGUMENT,To my own children; for from Crete I fled
8441,ARGUMENT,"For slaughter of Orsilochus the swift,"
8442,ARGUMENT,"Son of Idomeneus, whom none in speed"
8443,ARGUMENT,Could equal throughout all that spacious isle.                   310
8444,ARGUMENT,His purpose was to plunder me of all
8445,ARGUMENT,"My Trojan spoils, which to obtain, much woe"
8446,ARGUMENT,"I had in battle and by storms endured,"
8447,ARGUMENT,"For that I would not gratify his Sire,"
8448,ARGUMENT,"Fighting beside him in the fields of Troy,"
8449,ARGUMENT,But led a diff'rent band. Him from the field
8450,ARGUMENT,"Returning homeward, with my brazen spear"
8451,ARGUMENT,"I smote, in ambush waiting his return"
8452,ARGUMENT,"At the road-side, with a confed'rate friend."
8453,ARGUMENT,Unwonted darkness over all the heav'ns                           320
8454,ARGUMENT,"That night prevailed, nor any eye of man"
8455,ARGUMENT,"Observed us, but, unseen, I slew the youth."
8456,ARGUMENT,"No sooner, then, with my sharp spear of life"
8457,ARGUMENT,"I had bereft him, than I sought a ship"
8458,ARGUMENT,"Mann'd by renown'd Phæacians, whom with gifts"
8459,ARGUMENT,"Part of my spoils, and by requests, I won."
8460,ARGUMENT,"I bade them land me on the Pylian shore,"
8461,ARGUMENT,"Or in fair Elis by th' Epeans ruled,"
8462,ARGUMENT,"But they, reluctant, were by violent winds"
8463,ARGUMENT,"Driv'n devious thence, for fraud they purposed none.             330"
8464,ARGUMENT,"Thus through constraint we here arrived by night,"
8465,ARGUMENT,And with much difficulty push'd the ship
8466,ARGUMENT,"Into safe harbour, nor was mention made"
8467,ARGUMENT,"Of food by any, though all needed food,"
8468,ARGUMENT,"But, disembark'd in haste, on shore we lay."
8469,ARGUMENT,"I, weary, slept profound, and they my goods"
8470,ARGUMENT,"Forth heaving from the bark, beside me placed"
8471,ARGUMENT,"The treasures on the sea-beach where I slept,"
8472,ARGUMENT,"Then, reimbarking, to the populous coast"
8473,ARGUMENT,"Steer'd of Sidonia, and me left forlorn.                         340"
8474,ARGUMENT,He ceased; then smiled Minerva azure-eyed
8475,ARGUMENT,"And stroaked his cheek, in form a woman now,"
8476,ARGUMENT,"Beauteous, majestic, in all elegant arts"
8477,ARGUMENT,"Accomplish'd, and with accents wing'd replied."
8478,ARGUMENT,Who passes thee in artifice well-framed
8479,ARGUMENT,"And in imposture various, need shall find"
8480,ARGUMENT,"Of all his policy, although a God."
8481,ARGUMENT,"Canst thou not cease, inventive as thou art"
8482,ARGUMENT,"And subtle, from the wiles which thou hast lov'd"
8483,ARGUMENT,"Since thou wast infant, and from tricks of speech                350"
8484,ARGUMENT,"Delusive, even in thy native land?"
8485,ARGUMENT,"But come, dismiss we these ingenious shifts"
8486,ARGUMENT,"From our discourse, in which we both excel;"
8487,ARGUMENT,For thou of all men in expedients most
8488,ARGUMENT,"Abound'st and eloquence, and I, throughout"
8489,ARGUMENT,All heav'n have praise for wisdom and for art.
8490,ARGUMENT,"And know'st thou not thine Athenæan aid,"
8491,ARGUMENT,"Pallas, Jove's daughter, who in all thy toils"
8492,ARGUMENT,Assist thee and defend? I gave thee pow'r
8493,ARGUMENT,"T' engage the hearts of all Phæacia's sons,                      360"
8494,ARGUMENT,"And here arrive ev'n now, counsels to frame"
8495,ARGUMENT,"Discrete with thee, and to conceal the stores"
8496,ARGUMENT,Giv'n to thee by the rich Phæacian Chiefs
8497,ARGUMENT,"On my suggestion, at thy going thence."
8498,ARGUMENT,I will inform thee also what distress
8499,ARGUMENT,And hardship under thy own palace-roof
8500,ARGUMENT,"Thou must endure; which, since constraint enjoins,"
8501,ARGUMENT,"Bear patiently, and neither man apprize"
8502,ARGUMENT,Nor woman that thou hast arrived forlorn
8503,ARGUMENT,"And vagabond, but silent undergo                                 370"
8504,ARGUMENT,What wrongs soever from the hands of men.
8505,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
8506,ARGUMENT,"O Goddess! thou art able to elude,"
8507,ARGUMENT,"Wherever met, the keenest eye of man,"
8508,ARGUMENT,For thou all shapes assum'st; yet this I know
8509,ARGUMENT,"Certainly, that I ever found thee kind,"
8510,ARGUMENT,Long as Achaia's Heroes fought at Troy;
8511,ARGUMENT,But when (the lofty tow'rs of Priam laid
8512,ARGUMENT,"In dust) we re-embark'd, and by the will"
8513,ARGUMENT,"Of heav'n Achaia's fleet was scatter'd wide,                     380"
8514,ARGUMENT,"Thenceforth, O daughter wise of Jove, I thee"
8515,ARGUMENT,"Saw not, nor thy appearance in my ship"
8516,ARGUMENT,"Once mark'd, to rid me of my num'rous woes,"
8517,ARGUMENT,But always bearing in my breast a heart
8518,ARGUMENT,"With anguish riv'n, I roam'd, till by the Gods"
8519,ARGUMENT,"Relieved at length, and till with gracious words"
8520,ARGUMENT,Thyself didst in Phæacia's opulent land
8521,ARGUMENT,"Confirm my courage, and becam'st my guide."
8522,ARGUMENT,But I adjure thee in thy father's name--
8523,ARGUMENT,"O tell me truly, (for I cannot hope                              390"
8524,ARGUMENT,That I have reach'd fair Ithaca; I tread
8525,ARGUMENT,"Some other soil, and thou affirm'st it mine"
8526,ARGUMENT,"To mock me merely, and deceive) oh say--"
8527,ARGUMENT,"Am I in Ithaca? in truth, at home?"
8528,ARGUMENT,Thus then Minerva the cærulean-eyed.
8529,ARGUMENT,Such caution in thy breast always prevails
8530,ARGUMENT,"Distrustful; but I know thee eloquent,"
8531,ARGUMENT,"With wisdom and with ready thought endued,"
8532,ARGUMENT,"And cannot leave thee, therefore, thus distress'd"
8533,ARGUMENT,"For what man, save Ulysses, new-return'd                         400"
8534,ARGUMENT,"After long wand'rings, would not pant to see"
8535,ARGUMENT,"At once his home, his children, and his wife?"
8536,ARGUMENT,But thou preferr'st neither to know nor ask
8537,ARGUMENT,"Concerning them, till some experience first"
8538,ARGUMENT,Thou make of her whose wasted youth is spent
8539,ARGUMENT,"In barren solitude, and who in tears"
8540,ARGUMENT,Ceaseless her nights and woeful days consumes.
8541,ARGUMENT,"I ne'er was ignorant, but well foreknew"
8542,ARGUMENT,That not till after loss of all thy friends
8543,ARGUMENT,Thou should'st return; but loth I was to oppose                  410
8544,ARGUMENT,"Neptune, my father's brother, sore incensed"
8545,ARGUMENT,For his son's sake deprived of sight by thee.
8546,ARGUMENT,"But, I will give thee proof--come now--survey"
8547,ARGUMENT,"These marks of Ithaca, and be convinced."
8548,ARGUMENT,"This is the port of Phorcys, sea-born sage;"
8549,ARGUMENT,"That, the huge olive at the haven's head;"
8550,ARGUMENT,"Fast by it, thou behold'st the pleasant cove"
8551,ARGUMENT,"Umbrageous, to the nymphs devoted named"
8552,ARGUMENT,The Naiads; this the broad-arch'd cavern is
8553,ARGUMENT,Where thou wast wont to offer to the nymphs                      420
8554,ARGUMENT,Many a whole hecatomb; and yonder stands
8555,ARGUMENT,The mountain Neritus with forests cloath'd.
8556,ARGUMENT,"So saying, the Goddess scatter'd from before"
8557,ARGUMENT,"His eyes all darkness, and he knew the land."
8558,ARGUMENT,"Then felt Ulysses, Hero toil-inured,"
8559,ARGUMENT,"Transport unutterable, seeing plain"
8560,ARGUMENT,"Once more his native isle. He kiss'd the glebe,"
8561,ARGUMENT,And with uplifted hands the nymphs ador'd.
8562,ARGUMENT,"Nymphs, Naiads, Jove's own daughters! I despair'd"
8563,ARGUMENT,"To see you more, whom yet with happy vows                        430"
8564,ARGUMENT,"I now can hail again. Gifts, as of old,"
8565,ARGUMENT,"We will hereafter at your shrines present,"
8566,ARGUMENT,"If Jove-born Pallas, huntress of the spoils,"
8567,ARGUMENT,"Grant life to me, and manhood to my son."
8568,ARGUMENT,"Then Pallas, blue-eyed progeny of Jove."
8569,ARGUMENT,Take courage; trouble not thy mind with thoughts
8570,ARGUMENT,Now needless. Haste--delay not--far within
8571,ARGUMENT,This hallow'd cave's recess place we at once
8572,ARGUMENT,"Thy precious stores, that they may thine remain,"
8573,ARGUMENT,Then muse together on thy wisest course.                         440
8574,ARGUMENT,"So saying, the Goddess enter'd deep the cave"
8575,ARGUMENT,"Caliginous, and its secret nooks explored"
8576,ARGUMENT,"From side to side; meantime, Ulysses brought"
8577,ARGUMENT,"All his stores into it, the gold, the brass,"
8578,ARGUMENT,"And robes magnificent, his gifts received"
8579,ARGUMENT,"From the Phæacians; safe he lodg'd them all,"
8580,ARGUMENT,"And Pallas, daughter of Jove Ægis-arm'd,"
8581,ARGUMENT,"Closed fast, herself, the cavern with a stone."
8582,ARGUMENT,"Then, on the consecrated olive's root"
8583,ARGUMENT,"Both seated, they in consultation plann'd                        450"
8584,ARGUMENT,"The deaths of those injurious suitors proud,"
8585,ARGUMENT,"And Pallas, blue-eyed Goddess, thus began."
8586,ARGUMENT,"Laertes' noble son, Ulysses! think"
8587,ARGUMENT,By what means likeliest thou shalt assail
8588,ARGUMENT,"Those shameless suitors, who have now controuled"
8589,ARGUMENT,"Three years thy family, thy matchless wife"
8590,ARGUMENT,With language amorous and with spousal gifts
8591,ARGUMENT,"Urging importunate; but she, with tears"
8592,ARGUMENT,"Watching thy wish'd return, hope gives to all"
8593,ARGUMENT,"By messages of promise sent to each,                             460"
8594,ARGUMENT,Framing far other purposes the while.
8595,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus Ulysses wise return'd.
8596,ARGUMENT,"Ah, Agamemnon's miserable fate"
8597,ARGUMENT,"Had surely met me in my own abode,"
8598,ARGUMENT,"But for thy gracious warning, pow'r divine!"
8599,ARGUMENT,"Come then--Devise the means; teach me, thyself,"
8600,ARGUMENT,"The way to vengeance, and my soul inspire"
8601,ARGUMENT,"With daring fortitude, as when we loos'd"
8602,ARGUMENT,Her radiant frontlet from the brows of Troy.
8603,ARGUMENT,"Would'st thou with equal zeal, O Pallas! aid                     470"
8604,ARGUMENT,"Thy servant here, I would encounter thrice"
8605,ARGUMENT,"An hundred enemies, let me but perceive"
8606,ARGUMENT,Thy dread divinity my prompt ally.
8607,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then Pallas cærulean-eyed.
8608,ARGUMENT,"And such I will be; not unmark'd by me,"
8609,ARGUMENT,(Let once our time of enterprize arrive)
8610,ARGUMENT,"Shalt thou assail them. Many, as I judge,"
8611,ARGUMENT,Of those proud suitors who devour thy wealth
8612,ARGUMENT,"Shall leave their brains, then, on thy palace floor."
8613,ARGUMENT,But come. Behold! I will disguise thee so                        480
8614,ARGUMENT,That none shall know thee! I will parch the skin
8615,ARGUMENT,On thy fair body; I will cause thee shed
8616,ARGUMENT,Thy wavy locks; I will enfold thee round
8617,ARGUMENT,In such a kirtle as the eyes of all
8618,ARGUMENT,Shall loath to look on; and I will deform
8619,ARGUMENT,"With blurring rheums thy eyes, so vivid erst;"
8620,ARGUMENT,"So shall the suitors deem thee, and thy wife,"
8621,ARGUMENT,"And thy own son whom thou didst leave at home,"
8622,ARGUMENT,Some sordid wretch obscure. But seek thou first
8623,ARGUMENT,"Thy swine-herd's mansion; he, alike, intends                     490"
8624,ARGUMENT,"Thy good, and loves, affectionate, thy son"
8625,ARGUMENT,And thy Penelope; thou shalt find the swain
8626,ARGUMENT,Tending his herd; they feed beneath the rock
8627,ARGUMENT,"Corax, at side of Arethusa's fount,"
8628,ARGUMENT,"On acorns dieted, nutritious food"
8629,ARGUMENT,"To them, and drinking of the limpid stream."
8630,ARGUMENT,"There waiting, question him of thy concerns,"
8631,ARGUMENT,While I from Sparta praised for women fair
8632,ARGUMENT,"Call home thy son Telemachus, a guest"
8633,ARGUMENT,"With Menelaus now, whom to consult                               500"
8634,ARGUMENT,"In spacious Lacedæmon he is gone,"
8635,ARGUMENT,Anxious to learn if yet his father lives.
8636,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
8637,ARGUMENT,"And why, alas! all-knowing as thou art,"
8638,ARGUMENT,"Him left'st thou ignorant? was it that he,"
8639,ARGUMENT,"He also, wand'ring wide the barren Deep,"
8640,ARGUMENT,"Might suffer woe, while these devour his wealth?"
8641,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then Pallas cærulean-eyed.
8642,ARGUMENT,Grieve thou not much for him. I sent him forth
8643,ARGUMENT,"Myself, that there arrived, he might acquire                     510"
8644,ARGUMENT,"Honour and fame. No suff'rings finds he there,"
8645,ARGUMENT,"But in Atrides' palace safe resides,"
8646,ARGUMENT,"Enjoying all abundance. Him, in truth,"
8647,ARGUMENT,"The suitors watch close ambush'd on the Deep,"
8648,ARGUMENT,"Intent to slay him ere he reach his home,"
8649,ARGUMENT,"But shall not as I judge, till of themselves"
8650,ARGUMENT,"The earth hide some who make thee, now, a prey."
8651,ARGUMENT,"So saying, the Goddess touch'd him with a wand."
8652,ARGUMENT,At once o'er all his agile limbs she parch'd
8653,ARGUMENT,The polish'd skin; she wither'd to the root                      520
8654,ARGUMENT,His wavy locks; and cloath'd him with the hide
8655,ARGUMENT,Deform'd of wrinkled age; she charged with rheums
8656,ARGUMENT,"His eyes before so vivid, and a cloak"
8657,ARGUMENT,"And kirtle gave him, tatter'd, both, and foul,"
8658,ARGUMENT,"And smutch'd with smoak; then, casting over all"
8659,ARGUMENT,"An huge old deer-skin bald, with a long staff"
8660,ARGUMENT,"She furnish'd him, and with a wallet patch'd"
8661,ARGUMENT,"On all sides, dangling by a twisted thong."
8662,ARGUMENT,"Thus all their plan adjusted, diff'rent ways"
8663,ARGUMENT,"They took, and she, seeking Ulysses' son,                        530"
8664,ARGUMENT,To Lacedæmon's spacious realm repair'd.

8688,ARGUMENT,Mantled with trees led him to the abode
8689,ARGUMENT,By Pallas mention'd of his noble friend[61]
8690,ARGUMENT,"The swine-herd, who of all Ulysses' train"
8691,ARGUMENT,Watch'd with most diligence his rural stores.
8692,ARGUMENT,Him sitting in the vestibule he found
8693,ARGUMENT,"Of his own airy lodge commodious, built"
8694,ARGUMENT,Amidst a level lawn. That structure neat
8695,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus, in the absence of his Lord,                               10"
8696,ARGUMENT,"Had raised, himself, with stones from quarries hewn,"
8697,ARGUMENT,Unaided by Laertes or the Queen.
8698,ARGUMENT,"With tangled thorns he fenced it safe around,"
8699,ARGUMENT,And with contiguous stakes riv'n from the trunks
8700,ARGUMENT,Of solid oak black-grain'd hemm'd it without.
8701,ARGUMENT,"Twelve penns he made within, all side by side,"
8702,ARGUMENT,"Lairs for his swine, and fast-immured in each"
8703,ARGUMENT,Lay fifty pregnant females on the floor.
8704,ARGUMENT,"The males all slept without, less num'rous far,"
8705,ARGUMENT,Thinn'd by the princely wooers at their feasts                    20
8706,ARGUMENT,"Continual, for to them he ever sent"
8707,ARGUMENT,The fattest of his saginated charge.
8708,ARGUMENT,"Three hundred, still, and sixty brawns remained."
8709,ARGUMENT,"Four mastiffs in adjoining kennels lay,"
8710,ARGUMENT,Resembling wild-beasts nourish'd at the board
8711,ARGUMENT,Of the illustrious steward of the styes.
8712,ARGUMENT,"Himself sat fitting sandals to his feet,"
8713,ARGUMENT,"Carved from a stain'd ox-hide. Four hinds he kept,"
8714,ARGUMENT,Now busied here and there; three in the penns
8715,ARGUMENT,"Were occupied; meantime, the fourth had sought                    30"
8716,ARGUMENT,"The city, whither, for the suitors' use,"
8717,ARGUMENT,"With no good will, but by constraint, he drove"
8718,ARGUMENT,"A boar, that, sacrificing to the Gods,"
8719,ARGUMENT,Th' imperious guests might on his flesh regale.
8720,ARGUMENT,Soon as those clamorous watch-dogs the approach
8721,ARGUMENT,"Saw of Ulysses, baying loud, they ran"
8722,ARGUMENT,"Toward him; he, as ever, well-advised,"
8723,ARGUMENT,"Squatted, and let his staff fall from his hand."
8724,ARGUMENT,Yet foul indignity he had endured
8725,ARGUMENT,"Ev'n there, at his own farm, but that the swain,                  40"
8726,ARGUMENT,"Following his dogs in haste, sprang through the porch"
8727,ARGUMENT,"To his assistance, letting fall the hide."
8728,ARGUMENT,With chiding voice and vollied stones he soon
8729,ARGUMENT,"Drove them apart, and thus his Lord bespake."
8730,ARGUMENT,"Old man! one moment more, and these my dogs"
8731,ARGUMENT,"Had, past doubt, worried thee, who should'st have proved,"
8732,ARGUMENT,"So slain, a source of obloquy to me."
8733,ARGUMENT,"But other pangs the Gods, and other woes"
8734,ARGUMENT,"To me have giv'n, who here lamenting sit"
8735,ARGUMENT,"My godlike master, and his fatted swine                           50"
8736,ARGUMENT,"Nourish for others' use, while he, perchance,"
8737,ARGUMENT,"A wand'rer in some foreign city, seeks"
8738,ARGUMENT,"Fit sustenance, and none obtains, if still"
8739,ARGUMENT,"Indeed he live, and view the light of day."
8740,ARGUMENT,"But, old friend! follow me into the house,"
8741,ARGUMENT,"That thou, at least, with plenteous food refresh'd,"
8742,ARGUMENT,"And cheer'd with wine sufficient, may'st disclose"
8743,ARGUMENT,"Both who thou art, and all that thou hast borne."
8744,ARGUMENT,"So saying, the gen'rous swine-herd introduced"
8745,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, and thick bundles spread of twigs                        60"
8746,ARGUMENT,"Beneath him, cover'd with the shaggy skin"
8747,ARGUMENT,"Of a wild goat, of which he made his couch"
8748,ARGUMENT,"Easy and large; the Hero, so received,"
8749,ARGUMENT,"Rejoiced, and thus his gratitude express'd."
8750,ARGUMENT,"Jove grant thee and the Gods above, my host,"
8751,ARGUMENT,For such beneficence thy chief desire!
8752,ARGUMENT,"To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply."
8753,ARGUMENT,"My guest! I should offend, treating with scorn"
8754,ARGUMENT,"The stranger, though a poorer should arrive"
8755,ARGUMENT,"Than ev'n thyself; for all the poor that are,                     70"
8756,ARGUMENT,And all the strangers are the care of Jove.
8757,ARGUMENT,"Little, and with good will, is all that lies"
8758,ARGUMENT,Within my scope; no man can much expect
8759,ARGUMENT,From servants living in continual fear
8760,ARGUMENT,"Under young masters; for the Gods, no doubt,"
8761,ARGUMENT,"Have intercepted my own Lord's return,"
8762,ARGUMENT,"From whom great kindness I had, else, received,"
8763,ARGUMENT,With such a recompense as servants gain
8764,ARGUMENT,"From gen'rous masters, house and competence,"
8765,ARGUMENT,"And lovely wife from many a wooer won,                            80"
8766,ARGUMENT,Whose industry should have requited well
8767,ARGUMENT,"His goodness, with such blessing from the Gods"
8768,ARGUMENT,As now attends me in my present charge.
8769,ARGUMENT,"Much had I, therefore, prosper'd, had my Lord"
8770,ARGUMENT,Grown old at home; but he hath died--I would
8771,ARGUMENT,"That the whole house of Helen, one and all,"
8772,ARGUMENT,"Might perish too, for she hath many slain"
8773,ARGUMENT,"Who, like my master, went glory to win"
8774,ARGUMENT,For Agamemnon in the fields of Troy.
8775,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he girdled, quick, his tunic close,                  90"
8776,ARGUMENT,"And, issuing, sought the styes; thence bringing two"
8777,ARGUMENT,"Of the imprison'd herd, he slaughter'd both,"
8778,ARGUMENT,"Singed them, and slash'd and spitted them, and placed"
8779,ARGUMENT,"The whole well-roasted banquet, spits and all,"
8780,ARGUMENT,"Reeking before Ulysses; last, with flour"
8781,ARGUMENT,"He sprinkled them, and filling with rich wine"
8782,ARGUMENT,"His ivy goblet, to his master sat"
8783,ARGUMENT,"Opposite, whom inviting thus he said."
8784,ARGUMENT,"Now, eat, my guest! such as a servant may"
8785,ARGUMENT,"I set before thee, neither large of growth                       100"
8786,ARGUMENT,"Nor fat; the fatted--those the suitors eat,"
8787,ARGUMENT,"Fearless of heav'n, and pitiless of man."
8788,ARGUMENT,Yet deeds unjust as theirs the blessed Gods
8789,ARGUMENT,Love not; they honour equity and right.
8790,ARGUMENT,Even an hostile band when they invade
8791,ARGUMENT,"A foreign shore, which by consent of Jove"
8792,ARGUMENT,"They plunder, and with laden ships depart,"
8793,ARGUMENT,Even they with terrours quake of wrath divine.
8794,ARGUMENT,But these are wiser; these must sure have learn'd
8795,ARGUMENT,"From some true oracle my master's death,                         110"
8796,ARGUMENT,"Who neither deign with decency to woo,"
8797,ARGUMENT,"Nor yet to seek their homes, but boldly waste"
8798,ARGUMENT,"His substance, shameless, now, and sparing nought."
8799,ARGUMENT,Jove ne'er hath giv'n us yet the night or day
8800,ARGUMENT,"When with a single victim, or with two"
8801,ARGUMENT,"They would content them, and his empty jars"
8802,ARGUMENT,Witness how fast the squand'rers use his wine.
8803,ARGUMENT,"Time was, when he was rich indeed; such wealth"
8804,ARGUMENT,"No Hero own'd on yonder continent,"
8805,ARGUMENT,Nor yet in Ithaca; no twenty Chiefs                              120
8806,ARGUMENT,Could match with all their treasures his alone;
8807,ARGUMENT,I tell thee their amount. Twelve herds of his
8808,ARGUMENT,The mainland graze;[62] as many flocks of sheep;
8809,ARGUMENT,As many droves of swine; and hirelings there
8810,ARGUMENT,"And servants of his own seed for his use,"
8811,ARGUMENT,"As many num'rous flocks of goats; his goats,"
8812,ARGUMENT,(Not fewer than eleven num'rous flocks)
8813,ARGUMENT,Here also graze the margin of his fields
8814,ARGUMENT,"Under the eye of servants well-approved,"
8815,ARGUMENT,"And ev'ry servant, ev'ry day, brings home                        130"
8816,ARGUMENT,"The goat, of all his flock largest and best."
8817,ARGUMENT,"But as for me, I have these swine in charge,"
8818,ARGUMENT,"Of which, selected with exactest care"
8819,ARGUMENT,"From all the herd, I send the prime to them."
8820,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd, meantime Ulysses ate and drank"
8821,ARGUMENT,"Voracious, meditating, mute, the death"
8822,ARGUMENT,"Of those proud suitors. His repast, at length,"
8823,ARGUMENT,"Concluded, and his appetite sufficed,"
8824,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus gave him, charged with wine, the cup"
8825,ARGUMENT,"From which he drank himself; he, glad, received                  140"
8826,ARGUMENT,"The boon, and in wing'd accents thus began."
8827,ARGUMENT,"My friend, and who was he, wealthy and brave"
8828,ARGUMENT,"As thou describ'st the Chief, who purchased thee?"
8829,ARGUMENT,Thou say'st he perish'd for the glory-sake
8830,ARGUMENT,"Of Agamemnon. Name him; I, perchance,"
8831,ARGUMENT,May have beheld the Hero. None can say
8832,ARGUMENT,But Jove and the inhabitants of heav'n
8833,ARGUMENT,"That I ne'er saw him, and may not impart"
8834,ARGUMENT,News of him; I have roam'd through many a clime.
8835,ARGUMENT,To whom the noble swine-herd thus replied.                     150
8836,ARGUMENT,"Alas, old man! no trav'ler's tale of him"
8837,ARGUMENT,"Will gain his consort's credence, or his son's;"
8838,ARGUMENT,"For wand'rers, wanting entertainment, forge"
8839,ARGUMENT,"Falsehoods for bread, and wilfully deceive."
8840,ARGUMENT,"No wand'rer lands in Ithaca, but he seeks"
8841,ARGUMENT,With feign'd intelligence my mistress' ear;
8842,ARGUMENT,"She welcomes all, and while she questions each"
8843,ARGUMENT,"Minutely, from her lids lets fall the tear"
8844,ARGUMENT,"Affectionate, as well beseems a wife"
8845,ARGUMENT,Whose mate hath perish'd in a distant land.                      160
8846,ARGUMENT,"Thou could'st thyself, no doubt, my hoary friend!"
8847,ARGUMENT,(Would any furnish thee with decent vest
8848,ARGUMENT,And mantle) fabricate a tale with ease;
8849,ARGUMENT,"Yet sure it is that dogs and fowls, long since,"
8850,ARGUMENT,"His skin have stript, or fishes of the Deep"
8851,ARGUMENT,"Have eaten him, and on some distant shore"
8852,ARGUMENT,Whelm'd in deep sands his mould'ring bones are laid.
8853,ARGUMENT,"So hath he perish'd; whence, to all his friends,"
8854,ARGUMENT,"But chiefly to myself, sorrow of heart;"
8855,ARGUMENT,"For such another Lord, gentle as he,                             170"
8856,ARGUMENT,"Wherever sought, I have no hope to find,"
8857,ARGUMENT,Though I should wander even to the house
8858,ARGUMENT,Of my own father. Neither yearns my heart
8859,ARGUMENT,So feelingly (though that desiring too)
8860,ARGUMENT,"To see once more my parents and my home,"
8861,ARGUMENT,As to behold Ulysses yet again.
8862,ARGUMENT,"Ah stranger; absent as he is, his name"
8863,ARGUMENT,"Fills me with rev'rence, for he lov'd me much,"
8864,ARGUMENT,"Cared for me much, and, though we meet no more,"
8865,ARGUMENT,Holds still an elder brother's part in me.                       180
8866,ARGUMENT,"Him answer'd, then, the Hero toil-inured."
8867,ARGUMENT,"My friend! since his return, in thy account,"
8868,ARGUMENT,"Is an event impossible, and thy mind"
8869,ARGUMENT,"Always incredulous that hope rejects,"
8870,ARGUMENT,"I shall not slightly speak, but with an oath--"
8871,ARGUMENT,Ulysses comes again; and I demand
8872,ARGUMENT,"No more, than that the boon such news deserves,"
8873,ARGUMENT,Be giv'n me soon as he shall reach his home.
8874,ARGUMENT,"Then give me vest and mantle fit to wear,"
8875,ARGUMENT,"Which, ere that hour, much as I need them both,                  190"
8876,ARGUMENT,"I neither ask, nor will accept from thee."
8877,ARGUMENT,For him whom poverty can force aside
8878,ARGUMENT,From truth--I hate him as the gates of hell.
8879,ARGUMENT,"Be Jove, of all in heav'n, my witness first,"
8880,ARGUMENT,"Then, this thy hospitable board, and, last,"
8881,ARGUMENT,The household Gods of the illustrious Chief
8882,ARGUMENT,"Himself, Ulysses, to whose gates I go,"
8883,ARGUMENT,That all my words shall surely be fulfill'd.
8884,ARGUMENT,"In this same year Ulysses shall arrive,"
8885,ARGUMENT,"Ere, this month closed, another month succeed,                   200"
8886,ARGUMENT,"He shall return, and punish all who dare"
8887,ARGUMENT,Insult his consort and his noble son.
8888,ARGUMENT,"To whom Eumæus, thou didst thus reply."
8889,ARGUMENT,Old friend! that boon thou wilt ne'er earn from me;
8890,ARGUMENT,Ulysses comes no more. But thou thy wine
8891,ARGUMENT,"Drink quietly, and let us find, at length,"
8892,ARGUMENT,Some other theme; recall not this again
8893,ARGUMENT,"To my remembrance, for my soul is grieved"
8894,ARGUMENT,Oft as reminded of my honour'd Lord.
8895,ARGUMENT,"Let the oath rest, and let Ulysses come                          210"
8896,ARGUMENT,"Ev'n as myself, and as Penelope,"
8897,ARGUMENT,"And as his ancient father, and his son"
8898,ARGUMENT,"Godlike Telemachus, all wish he may."
8899,ARGUMENT,Ay--there I feel again--nor cease to mourn
8900,ARGUMENT,"His son Telemachus; who, when the Gods"
8901,ARGUMENT,"Had giv'n him growth like a young plant, and I"
8902,ARGUMENT,Well hoped that nought inferior he should prove
8903,ARGUMENT,"In person or in mind to his own sire,"
8904,ARGUMENT,"Hath lost, through influence human or divine,"
8905,ARGUMENT,"I know not how, his sober intellect,                             220"
8906,ARGUMENT,And after tidings of his sire is gone
8907,ARGUMENT,"To far-famed Pylus; his return, meantime,"
8908,ARGUMENT,"In ambush hidden the proud suitors wait,"
8909,ARGUMENT,That the whole house may perish of renown'd
8910,ARGUMENT,"Arcesias, named in Ithaca no more."
8911,ARGUMENT,"But whether he have fallen or 'scaped, let him"
8912,ARGUMENT,"Rest also, whom Saturnian Jove protect!"
8913,ARGUMENT,"But come, my ancient guest! now let me learn"
8914,ARGUMENT,Thy own afflictions; answer me in truth.
8915,ARGUMENT,"Who, and whence art thou? in what city born?                     230"
8916,ARGUMENT,Where dwell thy parents; in what kind of ship
8917,ARGUMENT,"Cam'st thou? the mariners, why brought they thee"
8918,ARGUMENT,To Ithaca? and of what land are they?
8919,ARGUMENT,"For, that on foot thou found'st us not, is sure."
8920,ARGUMENT,"Him answer'd, then, Ulysses, ever-wise."
8921,ARGUMENT,I will with truth resolve thee; and if here
8922,ARGUMENT,"Within thy cottage sitting, we had wine"
8923,ARGUMENT,"And food for many a day, and business none"
8924,ARGUMENT,"But to regale at ease while others toiled,"
8925,ARGUMENT,"I could exhaust the year complete, my woes                       240"
8926,ARGUMENT,"Rehearsing, nor, at last, rehearse entire"
8927,ARGUMENT,My sorrows by the will of heav'n sustained.
8928,ARGUMENT,I boast me sprung from ancestry renown'd
8929,ARGUMENT,"In spacious Crete; son of a wealthy sire,"
8930,ARGUMENT,"Who other sons train'd num'rous in his house,"
8931,ARGUMENT,Born of his wedded wife; but he begat
8932,ARGUMENT,"Me on his purchased concubine, whom yet"
8933,ARGUMENT,Dear as his other sons in wedlock born
8934,ARGUMENT,"Castor Hylacides esteem'd and lov'd,"
8935,ARGUMENT,"For him I boast my father. Him in Crete,                         250"
8936,ARGUMENT,"While yet he liv'd, all reverenc'd as a God,"
8937,ARGUMENT,"So rich, so prosp'rous, and so blest was he"
8938,ARGUMENT,"With sons of highest praise. But death, the doom"
8939,ARGUMENT,"Of all, him bore to Pluto's drear abode,"
8940,ARGUMENT,And his illustrious sons among themselves
8941,ARGUMENT,"Portion'd his goods by lot; to me, indeed,"
8942,ARGUMENT,"They gave a dwelling, and but little more,"
8943,ARGUMENT,"Yet, for my virtuous qualities, I won"
8944,ARGUMENT,"A wealthy bride, for I was neither vain"
8945,ARGUMENT,"Nor base, forlorn as thou perceiv'st me now.                     260"
8946,ARGUMENT,"But thou canst guess, I judge, viewing the straw"
8947,ARGUMENT,What once was in the ear. Ah! I have borne
8948,ARGUMENT,Much tribulation; heap'd and heavy woes.
8949,ARGUMENT,Courage and phalanx-breaking might had I
8950,ARGUMENT,"From Mars and Pallas; at what time I drew,"
8951,ARGUMENT,(Planning some dread exploit) an ambush forth
8952,ARGUMENT,"Of our most valiant Chiefs, no boding fears"
8953,ARGUMENT,"Of death seized _me_, but foremost far of all"
8954,ARGUMENT,"I sprang to fight, and pierced the flying foe."
8955,ARGUMENT,Such was I once in arms. But household toils                     270
8956,ARGUMENT,"Sustain'd for children's sake, and carking cares"
8957,ARGUMENT,"T' enrich a family, were not for me."
8958,ARGUMENT,"My pleasures were the gallant bark, the din"
8959,ARGUMENT,"Of battle, the smooth spear and glitt'ring shaft,"
8960,ARGUMENT,"Objects of dread to others, but which me"
8961,ARGUMENT,The Gods disposed to love and to enjoy.
8962,ARGUMENT,Thus diff'rent minds are diff'rently amused;
8963,ARGUMENT,"For ere Achaia's fleet had sailed to Troy,"
8964,ARGUMENT,Nine times was I commander of an host
8965,ARGUMENT,"Embark'd against a foreign foe, and found                        280"
8966,ARGUMENT,In all those enterprizes great success.
8967,ARGUMENT,"From the whole booty, first, what pleased me most"
8968,ARGUMENT,"Chusing, and sharing also much by lot"
8969,ARGUMENT,"I rapidly grew rich, and had thenceforth"
8970,ARGUMENT,Among the Cretans rev'rence and respect.
8971,ARGUMENT,But when loud-thund'ring Jove that voyage dire
8972,ARGUMENT,"Ordain'd, which loos'd the knees of many a Greek,"
8973,ARGUMENT,"Then, to Idomeneus and me they gave"
8974,ARGUMENT,"The charge of all their fleet, which how to avoid"
8975,ARGUMENT,"We found not, so importunate the cry                             290"
8976,ARGUMENT,Of the whole host impell'd us to the task.
8977,ARGUMENT,"There fought we nine long years, and in the tenth"
8978,ARGUMENT,(Priam's proud city pillag'd) steer'd again
8979,ARGUMENT,"Our galleys homeward, which the Gods dispersed."
8980,ARGUMENT,Then was it that deep-planning Jove devised
8981,ARGUMENT,"For me much evil. One short month, no more,"
8982,ARGUMENT,"I gave to joys domestic, in my wife"
8983,ARGUMENT,"Happy, and in my babes, and in my wealth,"
8984,ARGUMENT,When the desire seiz'd me with sev'ral ships
8985,ARGUMENT,"Well-rigg'd, and furnish'd all with gallant crews,               300"
8986,ARGUMENT,"To sail for Ægypt; nine I fitted forth,"
8987,ARGUMENT,To which stout mariners assembled fast.
8988,ARGUMENT,Six days the chosen partners of my voyage
8989,ARGUMENT,"Feasted, to whom I num'rous victims gave"
8990,ARGUMENT,"For sacrifice, and for their own regale."
8991,ARGUMENT,"Embarking on the sev'nth from spacious Crete,"
8992,ARGUMENT,Before a clear breeze prosp'rous from the North
8993,ARGUMENT,"We glided easily along, as down"
8994,ARGUMENT,A river's stream; nor one of all my ships
8995,ARGUMENT,"Damage incurr'd, but healthy and at ease                         310"
8996,ARGUMENT,"We sat, while gales well-managed urged us on."
8997,ARGUMENT,"The fifth day thence, smooth-flowing Nile we reach'd,"
8998,ARGUMENT,And safe I moor'd in the Ægyptian stream.
8999,ARGUMENT,"Then, charging all my mariners to keep"
9000,ARGUMENT,"Strict watch for preservation of the ships,"
9001,ARGUMENT,I order'd spies into the hill-tops; but they
9002,ARGUMENT,Under the impulse of a spirit rash
9003,ARGUMENT,"And hot for quarrel, the well-cultur'd fields"
9004,ARGUMENT,"Pillaged of the Ægyptians, captive led"
9005,ARGUMENT,"Their wives and little ones, and slew the men.                   320"
9006,ARGUMENT,"Soon was the city alarm'd, and at the cry"
9007,ARGUMENT,"Down came the citizens, by dawn of day,"
9008,ARGUMENT,"With horse and foot, and with the gleam of arms"
9009,ARGUMENT,Filling the plain. Then Jove with panic dread
9010,ARGUMENT,Struck all my people; none found courage more
9011,ARGUMENT,"To stand, for mischiefs swarm'd on ev'ry side."
9012,ARGUMENT,"There, num'rous by the glittering spear we fell"
9013,ARGUMENT,"Slaughter'd, while others they conducted thence"
9014,ARGUMENT,Alive to servitude. But Jove himself
9015,ARGUMENT,"My bosom with this thought inspired, (I would                    330"
9016,ARGUMENT,"That, dying, I had first fulfill'd my fate"
9017,ARGUMENT,"In Ægypt, for new woes were yet to come!)"
9018,ARGUMENT,"Loosing my brazen casque, and slipping off"
9019,ARGUMENT,"My buckler, there I left them on the field,"
9020,ARGUMENT,"Then cast my spear away, and seeking, next,"
9021,ARGUMENT,"The chariot of the sov'reign, clasp'd his knees,"
9022,ARGUMENT,"And kiss'd them. He, by my submission moved,"
9023,ARGUMENT,"Deliver'd me, and to his chariot-seat"
9024,ARGUMENT,"Raising, convey'd me weeping to his home."
9025,ARGUMENT,With many an ashen spear his warriors sought                     340
9026,ARGUMENT,"To slay me, (for they now grew fiery wroth)"
9027,ARGUMENT,"But he, through fear of hospitable Jove,"
9028,ARGUMENT,"Chief punisher of wrong, saved me alive."
9029,ARGUMENT,"Sev'n years I there abode, and much amass'd"
9030,ARGUMENT,"Among the Ægyptians, gifted by them all;"
9031,ARGUMENT,"But, in the eighth revolving year, arrived"
9032,ARGUMENT,"A shrewd Phœnician, in all fraud adept,"
9033,ARGUMENT,"Hungry, and who had num'rous harm'd before,"
9034,ARGUMENT,"By whom I also was cajoled, and lured"
9035,ARGUMENT,"T' attend him to Phœnicia, where his house                       350"
9036,ARGUMENT,And his possessions lay; there I abode
9037,ARGUMENT,A year complete his inmate; but (the days
9038,ARGUMENT,"And months accomplish'd of the rolling year,"
9039,ARGUMENT,And the new seasons ent'ring on their course)
9040,ARGUMENT,"To Lybia then, on board his bark, by wiles"
9041,ARGUMENT,"He won me with him, partner of the freight"
9042,ARGUMENT,"Profess'd, but destin'd secretly to sale,"
9043,ARGUMENT,That he might profit largely by my price.
9044,ARGUMENT,"Not unsuspicious, yet constrain'd to go,"
9045,ARGUMENT,With this man I embark'd. A cloudless gale                       360
9046,ARGUMENT,"Propitious blowing from the North, our ship"
9047,ARGUMENT,"Ran right before it through the middle sea,"
9048,ARGUMENT,In the offing over Crete; but adverse Jove
9049,ARGUMENT,Destruction plann'd for them and death the while.
9050,ARGUMENT,"For, Crete now left afar, and other land"
9051,ARGUMENT,"Appearing none, but sky alone and sea,"
9052,ARGUMENT,Right o'er the hollow bark Saturnian Jove
9053,ARGUMENT,"A cloud cærulean hung, dark'ning the Deep."
9054,ARGUMENT,"Then, thund'ring oft, he hurl'd into the bark"
9055,ARGUMENT,"His bolts; she smitten by the fires of Jove,                     370"
9056,ARGUMENT,"Quaked all her length; with sulphur fill'd she reek'd,"
9057,ARGUMENT,"And, o'er her sides precipitated, plunged"
9058,ARGUMENT,"Like gulls the crew, forbidden by that stroke"
9059,ARGUMENT,Of wrath divine to hope their country more.
9060,ARGUMENT,"But Jove himself, when I had cast away"
9061,ARGUMENT,"All hope of life, conducted to my arms"
9062,ARGUMENT,"The strong tall mast, that I might yet escape."
9063,ARGUMENT,"Around that beam I clung, driving before"
9064,ARGUMENT,"The stormy blast. Nine days complete I drove,"
9065,ARGUMENT,"And, on the tenth dark night, the rolling flood                  380"
9066,ARGUMENT,Immense convey'd me to Thesprotia's shore.
9067,ARGUMENT,"There me the Hero Phidon, gen'rous King"
9068,ARGUMENT,"Of the Thesprotians, freely entertained;"
9069,ARGUMENT,For his own son discov'ring me with toil
9070,ARGUMENT,"Exhausted and with cold, raised me, and thence"
9071,ARGUMENT,"Led me humanely to his father's house,"
9072,ARGUMENT,"Who cherish'd me, and gave me fresh attire."
9073,ARGUMENT,"There heard I of Ulysses, whom himself"
9074,ARGUMENT,"Had entertain'd, he said, on his return"
9075,ARGUMENT,"To his own land; he shew'd me also gold,                         390"
9076,ARGUMENT,"Brass, and bright steel elab'rate, whatsoe'er"
9077,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses had amass'd, a store to feed"
9078,ARGUMENT,A less illustrious family than his
9079,ARGUMENT,"To the tenth generation, so immense"
9080,ARGUMENT,His treasures in the royal palace lay.
9081,ARGUMENT,"Himself, he said, was to Dodona gone,"
9082,ARGUMENT,"There, from the tow'ring oaks of Jove to ask"
9083,ARGUMENT,"Counsel divine, if openly to land"
9084,ARGUMENT,(After long absence) in his opulent realm
9085,ARGUMENT,"Of Ithaca, be best, or in disguise.                              400"
9086,ARGUMENT,"To me the monarch swore, in his own hall"
9087,ARGUMENT,"Pouring libation, that the ship was launch'd,"
9088,ARGUMENT,And the crew ready for his conduct home.
9089,ARGUMENT,"But me he first dismiss'd, for, as it chanced,"
9090,ARGUMENT,"A ship lay there of the Thesprotians, bound"
9091,ARGUMENT,To green Dulichium's isle. He bade the crew
9092,ARGUMENT,Bear me to King Acastus with all speed;
9093,ARGUMENT,"But them far other thoughts pleased more, and thoughts"
9094,ARGUMENT,"Of harm to me, that I might yet be plunged"
9095,ARGUMENT,In deeper gulphs of woe than I had known.                        410
9096,ARGUMENT,"For, when the billow-cleaving bark had left"
9097,ARGUMENT,"The land remote, framing, combined, a plot"
9098,ARGUMENT,"Against my liberty, they stripp'd my vest"
9099,ARGUMENT,"And mantle, and this tatter'd raiment foul"
9100,ARGUMENT,"Gave me instead, which thy own eyes behold."
9101,ARGUMENT,At even-tide reaching the cultur'd coast
9102,ARGUMENT,"Of Ithaca, they left me bound on board"
9103,ARGUMENT,"With tackle of the bark, and quitting ship"
9104,ARGUMENT,"Themselves, made hasty supper on the shore."
9105,ARGUMENT,"But me, meantime, the Gods easily loos'd                         420"
9106,ARGUMENT,"By their own pow'r, when, with wrapper vile"
9107,ARGUMENT,"Around my brows, sliding into the sea"
9108,ARGUMENT,"At the ship's stern, I lay'd me on the flood."
9109,ARGUMENT,"With both hands oaring thence my course, I swam"
9110,ARGUMENT,Till past all ken of theirs; then landing where
9111,ARGUMENT,"Thick covert of luxuriant trees I mark'd,"
9112,ARGUMENT,"Close couchant down I lay; they mutt'ring loud,"
9113,ARGUMENT,"Paced to and fro, but deeming farther search"
9114,ARGUMENT,"Unprofitable, soon embark'd again."
9115,ARGUMENT,"Thus baffling all their search with ease, the Gods               430"
9116,ARGUMENT,Conceal'd and led me thence to the abode
9117,ARGUMENT,"Of a wise man, dooming me still to live."
9118,ARGUMENT,"To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply,"
9119,ARGUMENT,Alas! my most compassionable guest!
9120,ARGUMENT,Thou hast much moved me by this tale minute
9121,ARGUMENT,Of thy sad wand'rings and thy num'rous woes.
9122,ARGUMENT,"But, speaking of Ulysses, thou hast pass'd"
9123,ARGUMENT,All credence; I at least can give thee none.
9124,ARGUMENT,"Why, noble as thou art, should'st thou invent"
9125,ARGUMENT,Palpable falsehoods? as for the return                           440
9126,ARGUMENT,"Of my regretted Lord, myself I know"
9127,ARGUMENT,That had he not been hated by the Gods
9128,ARGUMENT,"Unanimous, he had in battle died"
9129,ARGUMENT,"At Troy, or (that long doubtful war, at last,"
9130,ARGUMENT,"Concluded,) in his people's arms at home."
9131,ARGUMENT,"Then universal Greece had raised his tomb,"
9132,ARGUMENT,And he had even for his son atchiev'd
9133,ARGUMENT,Immortal glory; but alas! by beaks
9134,ARGUMENT,"Of harpies torn, unseemly sight, he lies."
9135,ARGUMENT,Here is my home the while; I never seek                          450
9136,ARGUMENT,"The city, unless summon'd by discrete"
9137,ARGUMENT,Penelope to listen to the news
9138,ARGUMENT,"Brought by some stranger, whencesoe'er arrived."
9139,ARGUMENT,"Then, all, alike inquisitive, attend,"
9140,ARGUMENT,"Both who regret the absence of our King,"
9141,ARGUMENT,And who rejoice gratuitous to gorge
9142,ARGUMENT,"His property; but as for me, no joy"
9143,ARGUMENT,"Find I in list'ning after such reports,"
9144,ARGUMENT,"Since an Ætolian cozen'd me, who found"
9145,ARGUMENT,(After long wand'ring over various lands                         460
9146,ARGUMENT,A fugitive for blood) my lone retreat.
9147,ARGUMENT,"Him warm I welcom'd, and with open arms"
9148,ARGUMENT,"Receiv'd, who bold affirm'd that he had seen"
9149,ARGUMENT,My master with Idomeneus at Crete
9150,ARGUMENT,"His ships refitting shatter'd by a storm,"
9151,ARGUMENT,And that in summer with his godlike band
9152,ARGUMENT,"He would return, bringing great riches home,"
9153,ARGUMENT,Or else in autumn. And thou ancient guest
9154,ARGUMENT,"Forlorn! since thee the Gods have hither led,"
9155,ARGUMENT,Seek not to gratify me with untruths                             470
9156,ARGUMENT,"And to deceive me, since for no such cause"
9157,ARGUMENT,"I shall respect or love thee, but alone"
9158,ARGUMENT,"By pity influenced, and the fear of Jove."
9159,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
9160,ARGUMENT,"Thou hast, in truth, a most incredulous mind,"
9161,ARGUMENT,"Whom even with an oath I have not moved,"
9162,ARGUMENT,Or aught persuaded. Come then--let us make
9163,ARGUMENT,"In terms express a cov'nant, and the Gods"
9164,ARGUMENT,"Who hold Olympus, witness to us both!"
9165,ARGUMENT,"If thy own Lord at this thy house arrive,                        480"
9166,ARGUMENT,Thou shalt dismiss me decently attired
9167,ARGUMENT,"In vest and mantle, that I may repair"
9168,ARGUMENT,"Hence to Dulichium, whither I would go."
9169,ARGUMENT,"But, if thy Lord come not, then, gath'ring all"
9170,ARGUMENT,"Thy servants, headlong hurl me from a rock,"
9171,ARGUMENT,That other mendicants may fear to lie.
9172,ARGUMENT,To whom the generous swine-herd in return.
9173,ARGUMENT,"Yes, stranger! doubtless I should high renown"
9174,ARGUMENT,"Obtain for virtue among men, both now"
9175,ARGUMENT,"And in all future times, if, having first                        490"
9176,ARGUMENT,"Invited thee, and at my board regaled,"
9177,ARGUMENT,"I, next, should slay thee; then my pray'rs would mount,"
9178,ARGUMENT,"Past question, swiftly to Saturnian Jove."
9179,ARGUMENT,"But the hour calls to supper, and, ere long,"
9180,ARGUMENT,The partners of my toils will come prepared
9181,ARGUMENT,To spread the board with no unsav'ry cheer.
9182,ARGUMENT,"Thus they conferr'd. And now the swains arrived,"
9183,ARGUMENT,"Driving their charge, which fast they soon enclosed"
9184,ARGUMENT,"Within their customary penns, and loud"
9185,ARGUMENT,The hubbub was of swine prison'd within.                         500
9186,ARGUMENT,Then call'd the master to his rustic train.
9187,ARGUMENT,"Bring ye the best, that we may set him forth"
9188,ARGUMENT,"Before my friend from foreign climes arrived,"
9189,ARGUMENT,"With whom ourselves will also feast, who find"
9190,ARGUMENT,"The bright-tusk'd multitude a painful charge,"
9191,ARGUMENT,"While others, at no cost of theirs, consume"
9192,ARGUMENT,"Day after day, the profit of our toils."
9193,ARGUMENT,"So saying, his wood for fuel he prepared,"
9194,ARGUMENT,And dragging thither a well-fatted brawn
9195,ARGUMENT,Of the fifth year his servants held him fast                     510
9196,ARGUMENT,At the hearth-side. Nor failed the master swain
9197,ARGUMENT,"T' adore the Gods, (for wise and good was he)"
9198,ARGUMENT,"But consecration of the victim, first,"
9199,ARGUMENT,"Himself performing, cast into the fire"
9200,ARGUMENT,"The forehead bristles of the tusky boar,"
9201,ARGUMENT,"Then pray'd to all above, that, safe, at length,"
9202,ARGUMENT,Ulysses might regain his native home.
9203,ARGUMENT,Then lifting an huge shive that lay beside
9204,ARGUMENT,"The fire, he smote the boar, and dead he fell,"
9205,ARGUMENT,"Next, piercing him, and scorching close his hair,                520"
9206,ARGUMENT,"They carv'd him quickly, and Eumæus spread"
9207,ARGUMENT,Thin slices crude taken from ev'ry limb
9208,ARGUMENT,"O'er all his fat, then other slices cast,"
9209,ARGUMENT,"Sprinkling them first with meal, into the fire."
9210,ARGUMENT,"The rest they slash'd and scored, and roasted well,"
9211,ARGUMENT,"And placed it, heap'd together, on the board."
9212,ARGUMENT,Then rose the good Eumæus to his task
9213,ARGUMENT,"Of distribution, for he understood"
9214,ARGUMENT,The hospitable entertainer's part.
9215,ARGUMENT,"Sev'n-fold partition of the banquet made,                        530"
9216,ARGUMENT,"He gave, with previous pray'r, to Maia's son[63]"
9217,ARGUMENT,"And to the nymphs one portion of the whole,"
9218,ARGUMENT,"Then served his present guests, honouring first"
9219,ARGUMENT,Ulysses with the boar's perpetual chine;
9220,ARGUMENT,By that distinction just his master's heart
9221,ARGUMENT,"He gratified, and thus the Hero spake."
9222,ARGUMENT,Eumæus! be thou as belov'd of Jove
9223,ARGUMENT,"As thou art dear to me, whom, though attired"
9224,ARGUMENT,"So coarsely, thou hast served with such respect!"
9225,ARGUMENT,"To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply.                        540"
9226,ARGUMENT,"Eat, noble stranger! and refreshment take"
9227,ARGUMENT,"Such as thou may'st; God[64] gives, and God denies"
9228,ARGUMENT,"At his own will, for He is Lord of all."
9229,ARGUMENT,"He said, and to the everlasting Gods"
9230,ARGUMENT,"The firstlings sacrificed of all, then made"
9231,ARGUMENT,"Libation, and the cup placed in the hands"
9232,ARGUMENT,Of city-spoiler Laertiades
9233,ARGUMENT,Sitting beside his own allotted share.
9234,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, Mesaulius bread dispensed to all,"
9235,ARGUMENT,"Whom, in the absence of his Lord, himself                        550"
9236,ARGUMENT,Eumæus had from Taphian traders bought
9237,ARGUMENT,"With his own proper goods, at no expence"
9238,ARGUMENT,Either to old Laertes or the Queen.
9239,ARGUMENT,"And now, all stretch'd their hands toward the feast"
9240,ARGUMENT,"Reeking before them, and when hunger none"
9241,ARGUMENT,"Felt more or thirst, Mesaulius clear'd the board."
9242,ARGUMENT,"Then, fed to full satiety, in haste"
9243,ARGUMENT,"Each sought his couch. Black came a moonless night,"
9244,ARGUMENT,"And Jove all night descended fast in show'rs,"
9245,ARGUMENT,With howlings of the ever wat'ry West.                           560
9246,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, at that sound, for trial sake"
9247,ARGUMENT,"Of his good host, if putting off his cloak"
9248,ARGUMENT,"He would accommodate him, or require"
9249,ARGUMENT,"That service for him at some other hand,"
9250,ARGUMENT,"Addressing thus the family, began."
9251,ARGUMENT,"Hear now, Eumæus, and ye other swains"
9252,ARGUMENT,"His fellow-lab'rers! I shall somewhat boast,"
9253,ARGUMENT,"By wine befool'd, which forces ev'n the wise"
9254,ARGUMENT,"To carol loud, to titter and to dance,"
9255,ARGUMENT,"And words to utter, oft, better suppress'd.                      570"
9256,ARGUMENT,"But since I have begun, I shall proceed,"
9257,ARGUMENT,Prating my fill. Ah might those days return
9258,ARGUMENT,"With all the youth and strength that I enjoy'd,"
9259,ARGUMENT,"When in close ambush, once, at Troy we lay!"
9260,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, Menelaus, and myself"
9261,ARGUMENT,"Their chosen coadjutor, led the band."
9262,ARGUMENT,Approaching to the city's lofty wall
9263,ARGUMENT,Through the thick bushes and the reeds that gird
9264,ARGUMENT,"The bulwarks, down we lay flat in the marsh,"
9265,ARGUMENT,"Under our arms, then Boreas blowing loud,                        580"
9266,ARGUMENT,"A rueful night came on, frosty and charged"
9267,ARGUMENT,"With snow that blanch'd us thick as morning rime,"
9268,ARGUMENT,And ev'ry shield with ice was crystall'd o'er.
9269,ARGUMENT,"The rest with cloaks and vests well cover'd, slept"
9270,ARGUMENT,"Beneath their bucklers; I alone my cloak,"
9271,ARGUMENT,"Improvident, had left behind, no thought"
9272,ARGUMENT,Conceiving of a season so severe;
9273,ARGUMENT,"Shield and belt, therefore, and nought else had I."
9274,ARGUMENT,"The night, at last, nigh spent, and all the stars"
9275,ARGUMENT,"Declining in their course, with elbow thrust                     590"
9276,ARGUMENT,"Against Ulysses' side I roused the Chief,"
9277,ARGUMENT,And thus address'd him ever prompt to hear.
9278,ARGUMENT,"Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!"
9279,ARGUMENT,"I freeze to death. Help me, or I am lost."
9280,ARGUMENT,"No cloak have I; some evil dæmon, sure,"
9281,ARGUMENT,"Beguil'd me of all prudence, that I came"
9282,ARGUMENT,"Thus sparely clad; I shall, I must expire."
9283,ARGUMENT,"So I; he, ready as he was in arms"
9284,ARGUMENT,"And counsel both, the remedy at once"
9285,ARGUMENT,"Devised, and thus, low-whisp'ring, answer'd me.                  600"
9286,ARGUMENT,"Hush! lest perchance some other hear--He said,"
9287,ARGUMENT,"And leaning on his elbow, spake aloud."
9288,ARGUMENT,My friends! all hear--a monitory dream
9289,ARGUMENT,"Hath reach'd me, for we lie far from the ships."
9290,ARGUMENT,"Haste, therefore, one of you, with my request"
9291,ARGUMENT,"To Agamemnon, Atreus' son, our Chief,"
9292,ARGUMENT,That he would reinforce us from the camp.
9293,ARGUMENT,"He spake, and at the word, Andræmon's son"
9294,ARGUMENT,"Thoas arose, who, casting off his cloak,"
9295,ARGUMENT,"Ran thence toward the ships, and folded warm                     610"
9296,ARGUMENT,"Within it, there lay I till dawn appear'd."
9297,ARGUMENT,Oh for the vigour of such youth again!
9298,ARGUMENT,"Then, some good peasant here, either for love"
9299,ARGUMENT,"Or for respect, would cloak a man like me,"
9300,ARGUMENT,"Whom, now, thus sordid in attire ye scorn."
9301,ARGUMENT,"To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply."
9302,ARGUMENT,My ancient guest! I cannot but approve
9303,ARGUMENT,"Thy narrative, nor hast thou utter'd aught"
9304,ARGUMENT,"Unseemly, or that needs excuse. No want"
9305,ARGUMENT,"Of raiment, therefore, or of aught beside                        620"
9306,ARGUMENT,"Needful to solace penury like thine,"
9307,ARGUMENT,"Shall harm thee here; yet, at the peep of dawn"
9308,ARGUMENT,Gird thy own tatters to thy loins again;
9309,ARGUMENT,"For _we_ have no great store of cloaks to boast,"
9310,ARGUMENT,"Or change of vests, but singly one for each."
9311,ARGUMENT,"But when Ulysses' son shall once arrive,"
9312,ARGUMENT,He will himself with vest and mantle both
9313,ARGUMENT,"Cloath thee, and send thee whither most thou would'st."
9314,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he rose, and nearer made his couch"
9315,ARGUMENT,"To the hearth-side, spreading it thick with skins                630"
9316,ARGUMENT,"Of sheep and goats; then lay the Hero down,"
9317,ARGUMENT,"O'er whom a shaggy mantle large he threw,"
9318,ARGUMENT,"Which oft-times served him with a change, when rough"
9319,ARGUMENT,The winter's blast and terrible arose.
9320,ARGUMENT,"So was Ulysses bedded, and the youths"
9321,ARGUMENT,Slept all beside him; but the master-swain
9322,ARGUMENT,Chose not his place of rest so far remote
9323,ARGUMENT,"From his rude charge, but to the outer court"
9324,ARGUMENT,"With his nocturnal furniture, repair'd,"
9325,ARGUMENT,Gladd'ning Ulysses' heart that one so true                       640
9326,ARGUMENT,In his own absence kept his rural stores.
9327,ARGUMENT,"Athwart his sturdy shoulders, first, he flung"
9328,ARGUMENT,"His faulchion keen, then wrapp'd him in a cloak"
9329,ARGUMENT,"Thick-woven, winter-proof; he lifted, next,"
9330,ARGUMENT,"The skin of a well-thriven goat, in bulk"
9331,ARGUMENT,"Surpassing others, and his javelin took"
9332,ARGUMENT,"Sharp-pointed, with which dogs he drove and men."
9333,ARGUMENT,"Thus arm'd, he sought his wonted couch beneath"
9334,ARGUMENT,"A hollow rock where the herd slept, secure"
9335,ARGUMENT,From the sharp current of the Northern blast.                    650

9366,ARGUMENT,"sails, is accosted by Theoclymenos, a prophet of Argos, whom at his"
9367,ARGUMENT,earnest request he takes on board. In the meantime Eumæus relates to
9368,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses the means by which he came to Ithaca. Telemachus arriving there,"
9369,ARGUMENT,"gives orders for the return of his bark to the city, and repairs himself"
9370,ARGUMENT,to Eumæus.

9384,ARGUMENT,Thou canst no longer prudently remain
9385,ARGUMENT,"A wand'rer here, Telemachus! thy home"

9387,ARGUMENT,"Within thy walls; fear lest, partition made"
9388,ARGUMENT,"Of thy possessions, they devour the whole,"
9389,ARGUMENT,And in the end thy voyage bootless prove.
9390,ARGUMENT,Delay not; from brave Menelaus ask
9391,ARGUMENT,"Dismission hence, that thou may'st find at home"
9392,ARGUMENT,"Thy spotless mother, whom her brethren urge                       20"
9393,ARGUMENT,And her own father even now to wed

9396,ARGUMENT,"Some treasure, else, shall haply from thy house"

9398,ARGUMENT,For well thou know'st how woman is disposed;

9450,ARGUMENT,Telemachus! I will not long delay
9451,ARGUMENT,Thy wish'd return. I disapprove alike
9452,ARGUMENT,The host whose assiduity extreme                                  80
9453,ARGUMENT,"Distresses, and whose negligence offends;"
9454,ARGUMENT,"The middle course is best; alike we err,"
9455,ARGUMENT,"Him thrusting forth whose wish is to remain,"
9456,ARGUMENT,And hind'ring the impatient to depart.
9457,ARGUMENT,This only is true kindness--To regale
9458,ARGUMENT,"The present guest, and speed him when he would."
9459,ARGUMENT,"Yet stay, till thou shalt see my splendid gifts"
9460,ARGUMENT,"Placed in thy chariot, and till I command"
9461,ARGUMENT,My women from our present stores to spread
9462,ARGUMENT,The table with a plentiful repast.                                90
9463,ARGUMENT,"For both the honour of the guest demands,"
9464,ARGUMENT,"And his convenience also, that he eat"
9465,ARGUMENT,"Sufficient, ent'ring on a length of road."
9466,ARGUMENT,But if through Hellas thou wilt take thy way
9467,ARGUMENT,"And traverse Argos, I will, then, myself"
9468,ARGUMENT,Attend thee; thou shalt journey with my steeds
9469,ARGUMENT,"Beneath thy yoke, and I will be thy guide"
9470,ARGUMENT,"To many a city, whence we shall not go"
9471,ARGUMENT,"Ungratified, but shall in each receive"
9472,ARGUMENT,"Some gift at least, tripod, or charger bright,                   100"
9473,ARGUMENT,"Or golden chalice, or a pair of mules."
9474,ARGUMENT,"To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied."
9475,ARGUMENT,"Atrides, Menelaus, Chief renown'd!"
9476,ARGUMENT,"I would at once depart, (for guardian none"
9477,ARGUMENT,Of my possessions have I left behind)
9478,ARGUMENT,"Lest, while I seek my father, I be lost"
9479,ARGUMENT,"Myself, or lose what I should grudge to spare."
9480,ARGUMENT,"Which when the valiant Menelaus heard,"
9481,ARGUMENT,He bade his spouse and maidens spread the board
9482,ARGUMENT,At once with remnants of the last regale.                        110
9483,ARGUMENT,"Then Eteoneus came, Boetheus' son"
9484,ARGUMENT,"Newly aris'n, for nigh at hand he dwelt,"
9485,ARGUMENT,Whom Menelaus bade kindle the fire
9486,ARGUMENT,"By which to dress their food, and he obey'd."
9487,ARGUMENT,"He next, himself his fragrant chamber sought,"
9488,ARGUMENT,"Not sole, but by his spouse and by his son"
9489,ARGUMENT,"Attended, Megapenthes. There arrived"
9490,ARGUMENT,"Where all his treasures lay, Atrides, first,"
9491,ARGUMENT,"Took forth, himself, a goblet, then consign'd"
9492,ARGUMENT,To his son's hand an argent beaker bright.                       120
9493,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, beside her coffers Helen stood"
9494,ARGUMENT,"Where lay her variegated robes, fair works"
9495,ARGUMENT,"Of her own hand. Producing one, in size"
9496,ARGUMENT,"And in magnificence the chief, a star"
9497,ARGUMENT,"For splendour, and the lowest placed of all,"
9498,ARGUMENT,"Loveliest of her sex, she bore it thence."
9499,ARGUMENT,"Then, all proceeding through the house, they sought"
9500,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus again, whom reaching, thus"
9501,ARGUMENT,The Hero of the golden locks began.
9502,ARGUMENT,"May Jove the Thunderer, dread Juno's mate,                     130"
9503,ARGUMENT,"Grant thee, Telemachus! such voyage home"
9504,ARGUMENT,As thy own heart desires! accept from all
9505,ARGUMENT,My stores selected as the richest far
9506,ARGUMENT,And noblest gift for finish'd beauty--This.
9507,ARGUMENT,"I give thee wrought elaborate a cup,"
9508,ARGUMENT,"Itself all silver, bound with lip of gold."
9509,ARGUMENT,"It is the work of Vulcan, which to me"
9510,ARGUMENT,"The Hero Phædimus imparted, King"
9511,ARGUMENT,"Of the Sidonians, when, on my return,"
9512,ARGUMENT,Beneath his roof I lodg'd. I make it thine.                      140
9513,ARGUMENT,"So saying, the Hero, Atreus' son, the cup"
9514,ARGUMENT,"Placed in his hands, and Megapenthes set"
9515,ARGUMENT,"Before him, next, the argent beaker bright;"
9516,ARGUMENT,"But lovely Helen drawing nigh, the robe"
9517,ARGUMENT,"Presented to him, whom she thus address'd."
9518,ARGUMENT,"I also give thee, oh my son, a gift,"
9519,ARGUMENT,"Which seeing, thou shalt think on her whose hands"
9520,ARGUMENT,Wrought it; a present on thy nuptial day
9521,ARGUMENT,"For thy fair spouse; meantime, repose it safe"
9522,ARGUMENT,"In thy own mother's keeping. Now, farewell!                      150"
9523,ARGUMENT,Prosp'rous and happy be thy voyage home!
9524,ARGUMENT,"She ceas'd, and gave it to him, who the gift"
9525,ARGUMENT,"Accepted glad, and in the chariot-chest"
9526,ARGUMENT,"Pisistratus the Hero all disposed,"
9527,ARGUMENT,"Admiring them the while. They, following, next,"
9528,ARGUMENT,The Hero Menelaus to his hall
9529,ARGUMENT,Each on his couch or on his throne reposed.
9530,ARGUMENT,"A maiden, then, with golden ewer charged"
9531,ARGUMENT,"And silver bowl, pour'd water on their hands,"
9532,ARGUMENT,"And spread the polish'd table, which with food                   160"
9533,ARGUMENT,"Various, selected from her present stores,"
9534,ARGUMENT,The mistress of the household charge supplied.
9535,ARGUMENT,"Boetheus' son stood carver, and to each"
9536,ARGUMENT,"His portion gave, while Megapenthes, son"
9537,ARGUMENT,"Of glorious Menelaus, serv'd the cup."
9538,ARGUMENT,"Then, all with outstretch'd hands the feast assail'd,"
9539,ARGUMENT,And when nor hunger more nor thirst of wine
9540,ARGUMENT,"They felt, Telemachus and Nestor's son"
9541,ARGUMENT,"Yoked the swift steeds, and, taking each his seat"
9542,ARGUMENT,"In the resplendent chariot, drove at once                        170"
9543,ARGUMENT,Right through the sounding portico abroad.
9544,ARGUMENT,"But Menelaus, Hero amber-hair'd,"
9545,ARGUMENT,A golden cup bearing with richest wine
9546,ARGUMENT,"Replete in his right hand, follow'd them forth,"
9547,ARGUMENT,That not without libation first perform'd
9548,ARGUMENT,"They might depart; he stood before the steeds,"
9549,ARGUMENT,"And drinking first, thus, courteous, them bespake."
9550,ARGUMENT,"Health to you both, young friends! and from my lips"
9551,ARGUMENT,"Like greeting bear to Nestor, royal Chief,"
9552,ARGUMENT,For he was ever as a father kind                                 180
9553,ARGUMENT,"To me, while the Achaians warr'd at Troy."
9554,ARGUMENT,To whom Telemachus discrete replied.
9555,ARGUMENT,"And doubtless, so we will; at our return"
9556,ARGUMENT,"We will report to him, illustrious Prince!"
9557,ARGUMENT,"Thy ev'ry word. And oh, I would to heav'n"
9558,ARGUMENT,"That reaching Ithaca, I might at home"
9559,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses hail as sure, as I shall hence"
9560,ARGUMENT,"Depart, with all benevolence by thee"
9561,ARGUMENT,"Treated, and rich in many a noble gift."
9562,ARGUMENT,"While thus he spake, on his right hand appear'd                190"
9563,ARGUMENT,An eagle; in his talons pounced he bore
9564,ARGUMENT,"A white-plumed goose domestic, newly ta'en"
9565,ARGUMENT,From the house-court. Ran females all and males
9566,ARGUMENT,Clamorous after him; but he the steeds
9567,ARGUMENT,"Approaching on the right, sprang into air."
9568,ARGUMENT,That sight rejoicing and with hearts reviv'd
9569,ARGUMENT,"They view'd, and thus Pisistratus his speech"
9570,ARGUMENT,Amid them all to Menelaus turn'd.
9571,ARGUMENT,"Now, Menelaus, think, illustrious Chief!"
9572,ARGUMENT,"If us, this omen, or thyself regard.                             200"
9573,ARGUMENT,While warlike Menelaus musing stood
9574,ARGUMENT,"What answer fit to frame, Helen meantime,"
9575,ARGUMENT,"His spouse long-stoled preventing him, began."
9576,ARGUMENT,Hear me; for I will answer as the Gods
9577,ARGUMENT,"Teach me, and as I think shall come to pass."
9578,ARGUMENT,"As he, descending from his place of birth"
9579,ARGUMENT,"The mountains, caught our pamper'd goose away,"
9580,ARGUMENT,"So shall Ulysses, after many woes"
9581,ARGUMENT,"And wand'rings to his home restored, avenge"
9582,ARGUMENT,"His wrongs, or even now is at his home                           210"
9583,ARGUMENT,For all those suitors sowing seeds of woe.
9584,ARGUMENT,"To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied."
9585,ARGUMENT,"Oh grant it Jove, Juno's high-thund'ring mate!"
9586,ARGUMENT,"So will I, there arrived, with vow and pray'r"
9587,ARGUMENT,"Thee worship, as thou wert, thyself, divine."
9588,ARGUMENT,"He said, and lash'd the coursers; fiery they"
9589,ARGUMENT,"And fleet, sprang through the city to the plain."
9590,ARGUMENT,"All day the yoke on either side they shook,"
9591,ARGUMENT,Journeying swift; and now the setting sun
9592,ARGUMENT,"To gloomy evening had resign'd the roads,                        220"
9593,ARGUMENT,"When they to Pheræ came, and in the house"
9594,ARGUMENT,"Of good Diocles slept, their lib'ral host,"
9595,ARGUMENT,Whose sire Orsilochus from Alpheus sprang.
9596,ARGUMENT,"But when Aurora, daughter of the Dawn,"
9597,ARGUMENT,"Look'd rosy from the East, yoking their steeds,"
9598,ARGUMENT,They in the sumptuous chariot sat again.
9599,ARGUMENT,"Forth through the vestibule they drove, and through"
9600,ARGUMENT,"The sounding portico, when Nestor's son"
9601,ARGUMENT,"Plied brisk the scourge, and willing flew the steeds."
9602,ARGUMENT,"Thus whirl'd along, soon they approach'd the gates               230"
9603,ARGUMENT,"Of Pylus, when Telemachus, his speech"
9604,ARGUMENT,"Turning to his companion, thus began."
9605,ARGUMENT,"How, son of Nestor! shall I win from thee"
9606,ARGUMENT,"Not promise only, but performance kind"
9607,ARGUMENT,Of my request? we are not bound alone
9608,ARGUMENT,"To friendship by the friendship of our sires,"
9609,ARGUMENT,"But by equality of years, and this"
9610,ARGUMENT,Our journey shall unite us still the more.
9611,ARGUMENT,"Bear me not, I intreat thee, noble friend!"
9612,ARGUMENT,"Beyond the ship, but drop me at her side,                        240"
9613,ARGUMENT,"Lest ancient Nestor, though against my will,"
9614,ARGUMENT,Detain me in his palace through desire
9615,ARGUMENT,"To feast me, for I dread the least delay."
9616,ARGUMENT,He spake; then mused Pisistratus how best
9617,ARGUMENT,"He might effect the wishes of his friend,"
9618,ARGUMENT,And thus at length resolved; turning his steeds
9619,ARGUMENT,With sudden deviation to the shore
9620,ARGUMENT,"He sought the bark, and placing in the stern"
9621,ARGUMENT,"Both gold and raiment, the illustrious gifts"
9622,ARGUMENT,"Of Menelaus, thus, in accents wing'd                             250"
9623,ARGUMENT,"With ardour, urged Telemachus away."
9624,ARGUMENT,"Dispatch, embark, summon thy crew on board,"
9625,ARGUMENT,Ere my arrival notice give of thine
9626,ARGUMENT,To the old King; for vehement I know
9627,ARGUMENT,"His temper, neither will he let thee hence,"
9628,ARGUMENT,"But, hasting hither, will himself enforce"
9629,ARGUMENT,"Thy longer stay, that thou may'st not depart"
9630,ARGUMENT,Ungifted; nought will fire his anger more.
9631,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he to the Pylian city urged"
9632,ARGUMENT,"His steeds bright-maned, and at the palace-gate                  260"
9633,ARGUMENT,Arrived of Nestor speedily; meantime
9634,ARGUMENT,Telemachus exhorted thus his crew.
9635,ARGUMENT,"My gallant friends! set all your tackle, climb"
9636,ARGUMENT,"The sable bark, for I would now return."
9637,ARGUMENT,"He spake; they heard him gladly, and at once"
9638,ARGUMENT,All fill'd the benches. While his voyage he
9639,ARGUMENT,"Thus expedited, and beside the stern"
9640,ARGUMENT,"To Pallas sacrifice perform'd and pray'd,"
9641,ARGUMENT,"A stranger, born remote, who had escaped"
9642,ARGUMENT,"From Argos, fugitive for blood, a seer                           270"
9643,ARGUMENT,"And of Melampus' progeny, approach'd."
9644,ARGUMENT,"Melampus, in old time, in Pylus dwelt,"
9645,ARGUMENT,"Mother of flocks, alike for wealth renown'd"
9646,ARGUMENT,And the magnificence of his abode.
9647,ARGUMENT,"He, flying from the far-famed Pylian King,"
9648,ARGUMENT,"The mighty Neleus[65], migrated at length"
9649,ARGUMENT,"Into another land, whose wealth, the while,"
9650,ARGUMENT,Neleus by force possess'd a year complete.
9651,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, Melampus in the house endured"
9652,ARGUMENT,"Of Phylacus imprisonment and woe,                                280"
9653,ARGUMENT,And burn'd with wrath for Neleus' daughter sake
9654,ARGUMENT,By fell Erynnis kindled in his heart.
9655,ARGUMENT,"But, 'scaping death, he drove the lowing beeves"
9656,ARGUMENT,"From Phylace to Pylus, well avenged"
9657,ARGUMENT,His num'rous injuries at Neleus' hands
9658,ARGUMENT,"Sustain'd, and gave into his brother's arms"
9659,ARGUMENT,"King Neleus' daughter fair, the promis'd bride."
9660,ARGUMENT,"To Argos steed-renown'd he journey'd next,"
9661,ARGUMENT,There destin'd to inhabit and to rule
9662,ARGUMENT,Multitudes of Achaians. In that land                             290
9663,ARGUMENT,"He married, built a palace, and became"
9664,ARGUMENT,"Father of two brave sons, Antiphates"
9665,ARGUMENT,And Mantius; to Antiphates was born
9666,ARGUMENT,The brave Oïcleus; from Oïcleus sprang
9667,ARGUMENT,"Amphiaraüs, demagogue renown'd,"
9668,ARGUMENT,"Whom with all tenderness, and as a friend"
9669,ARGUMENT,Alike the Thund'rer and Apollo prized;
9670,ARGUMENT,Yet reach'd he not the bounds of hoary age.
9671,ARGUMENT,But by his mercenary consort's arts[66]
9672,ARGUMENT,"Persuaded, met his destiny at Thebes.                            300"
9673,ARGUMENT,He 'gat Alcmæon and Amphilocus.
9674,ARGUMENT,"Mantius was also father of two sons,"
9675,ARGUMENT,Clytus and Polyphides. Clytus pass'd
9676,ARGUMENT,"From earth to heav'n, and dwells among the Gods,"
9677,ARGUMENT,Stol'n by Aurora for his beauty's sake.
9678,ARGUMENT,But (brave Amphiaraüs once deceased)
9679,ARGUMENT,Phœbus exalted Polyphides far
9680,ARGUMENT,Above all others in the prophet's part.
9681,ARGUMENT,"He, anger'd by his father, roam'd away"
9682,ARGUMENT,"To Hyperesia, where he dwelt renown'd                            310"
9683,ARGUMENT,Throughout all lands the oracle of all.
9684,ARGUMENT,"His son, named Theoclymenus, was he"
9685,ARGUMENT,Who now approach'd; he found Telemachus
9686,ARGUMENT,"Libation off'ring in his bark, and pray'r,"
9687,ARGUMENT,And in wing'd accents ardent him address'd.
9688,ARGUMENT,"Ah, friend! since sacrificing in this place"
9689,ARGUMENT,"I find thee, by these sacred rites and those"
9690,ARGUMENT,"Whom thou ador'st, and by thy own dear life,"
9691,ARGUMENT,And by the lives of these thy mariners
9692,ARGUMENT,I beg true answer; hide not what I ask.                          320
9693,ARGUMENT,Who art thou? whence? where born? and sprung from whom?
9694,ARGUMENT,"To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied."
9695,ARGUMENT,"I will inform thee, stranger! and will solve"
9696,ARGUMENT,Thy questions with much truth. I am by birth
9697,ARGUMENT,"Ithacan, and Ulysses was my sire."
9698,ARGUMENT,"But he hath perish'd by a woeful death,"
9699,ARGUMENT,"And I, believing it, with these have plow'd"
9700,ARGUMENT,"The ocean hither, int'rested to learn"
9701,ARGUMENT,A father's fate long absent from his home.
9702,ARGUMENT,Then answer'd godlike Theoclymenus.                            330
9703,ARGUMENT,"I also am a wand'rer, having slain"
9704,ARGUMENT,A man of my own tribe; brethren and friends
9705,ARGUMENT,"Num'rous had he in Argos steed-renown'd,"
9706,ARGUMENT,And pow'rful are the Achaians dwelling there.
9707,ARGUMENT,"From them, through terrour of impending death,"
9708,ARGUMENT,"I fly, a banish'd man henceforth for ever."
9709,ARGUMENT,Ah save a suppliant fugitive! lest death
9710,ARGUMENT,"O'ertake me, for I doubt not their pursuit."
9711,ARGUMENT,Whom thus Telemachus answer'd discrete.
9712,ARGUMENT,"I shall not, be assured, since thou desir'st                     340"
9713,ARGUMENT,"To join me, chace thee from my bark away."
9714,ARGUMENT,"Follow me, therefore, and with us partake,"
9715,ARGUMENT,"In Ithaca, what best the land affords."
9716,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he at the stranger's hand received"
9717,ARGUMENT,"His spear, which on the deck he lay'd, then climb'd"
9718,ARGUMENT,"Himself the bark, and, seated in the stern,"
9719,ARGUMENT,At his own side placed Theoclymenus.
9720,ARGUMENT,They cast the hawsers loose; then with loud voice
9721,ARGUMENT,Telemachus exhorted all to hand
9722,ARGUMENT,"The tackle, whom the sailors prompt obey'd.                      350"
9723,ARGUMENT,"The tall mast heaving, in its socket deep"
9724,ARGUMENT,"They lodg'd it, and its cordage braced secure,"
9725,ARGUMENT,"Then, straining at the halyards, hoised the sail."
9726,ARGUMENT,"Fair wind, and blowing fresh through æther pure"
9727,ARGUMENT,"Minerva sent them, that the bark might run"
9728,ARGUMENT,Her nimblest course through all the briny way.
9729,ARGUMENT,"Now sank the sun, and dusky ev'ning dimm'd"
9730,ARGUMENT,"The waves, when, driven by propitious Jove,"
9731,ARGUMENT,His bark stood right for Pheræ; thence she stretch'd
9732,ARGUMENT,"To sacred Elis where the Epeans rule,                            360"
9733,ARGUMENT,And through the sharp Echinades he next
9734,ARGUMENT,"Steer'd her, uncertain whether fate ordain'd"
9735,ARGUMENT,"His life or death, surprizal or escape."
9736,ARGUMENT,Meantime Ulysses and the swine-herd ate
9737,ARGUMENT,"Their cottage-mess, and the assistant swains"
9738,ARGUMENT,Theirs also; and when hunger now and thirst
9739,ARGUMENT,"Had ceased in all, Ulysses thus began,"
9740,ARGUMENT,"Proving the swine-herd, whether friendly still,"
9741,ARGUMENT,"And anxious for his good, he would intreat"
9742,ARGUMENT,"His stay, or thence hasten him to the town.                      370"
9743,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus, and all ye his servants, hear!"
9744,ARGUMENT,"It is my purpose, lest I wear thee out,"
9745,ARGUMENT,"Thee and thy friends, to seek at early dawn"
9746,ARGUMENT,"The city, there to beg--But give me first"
9747,ARGUMENT,"Needful instructions, and a trusty guide"
9748,ARGUMENT,Who may conduct me thither; there my task
9749,ARGUMENT,Must be to roam the streets; some hand humane
9750,ARGUMENT,"Perchance shall give me a small pittance there,"
9751,ARGUMENT,"A little bread, and a few drops to drink."
9752,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses' palace I shall also seek,                               380"
9753,ARGUMENT,And to discrete Penelope report
9754,ARGUMENT,My tidings; neither shall I fail to mix
9755,ARGUMENT,"With those imperious suitors, who, themselves"
9756,ARGUMENT,"Full-fed, may spare perhaps some boon to me."
9757,ARGUMENT,"Me shall they find, in whatsoe'er they wish"
9758,ARGUMENT,"Their ready servitor, for (understand"
9759,ARGUMENT,"And mark me well) the herald of the skies,"
9760,ARGUMENT,"Hermes, from whom all actions of mankind"
9761,ARGUMENT,"Their grace receive and polish, is my friend,"
9762,ARGUMENT,So that in menial offices I fear                                 390
9763,ARGUMENT,"No rival, whether I be called to heap"
9764,ARGUMENT,"The hearth with fuel, or dry wood to cleave,"
9765,ARGUMENT,"To roast, to carve, or to distribute wine,"
9766,ARGUMENT,As oft the poor are wont who serve the great.
9767,ARGUMENT,"To whom, Eumæus! at those words displeased,"
9768,ARGUMENT,Thou didst reply. Gods! how could such a thought
9769,ARGUMENT,"Possess thee, stranger? surely thy resolve"
9770,ARGUMENT,"Is altogether fixt to perish there,"
9771,ARGUMENT,If thou indeed hast purposed with that throng
9772,ARGUMENT,"To mix, whose riot and outrageous acts                           400"
9773,ARGUMENT,Of violence echo through the vault of heav'n.
9774,ARGUMENT,"None, such as thou, serve _them_; their servitors"
9775,ARGUMENT,"Are youths well-cloak'd, well-vested; sleek their heads,"
9776,ARGUMENT,And smug their countenances; such alone
9777,ARGUMENT,"Are their attendants, and the polish'd boards"
9778,ARGUMENT,"Groan overcharg'd with bread, with flesh, with wine."
9779,ARGUMENT,Rest here content; for neither me nor these
9780,ARGUMENT,"Thou weariest aught, and when Ulysses' son"
9781,ARGUMENT,"Shall come, he will with vest and mantle fair"
9782,ARGUMENT,"Cloath thee, and send thee whither most thou would'st.           410"
9783,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, toil-inured."
9784,ARGUMENT,"I wish thee, O Eumæus! dear to Jove"
9785,ARGUMENT,"As thou art dear to me, for this reprieve"
9786,ARGUMENT,"Vouchsafed me kind, from wand'ring and from woe!"
9787,ARGUMENT,No worse condition is of mortal man
9788,ARGUMENT,"Than his who wanders; for the poor man, driv'n"
9789,ARGUMENT,"By woe and by misfortune homeless forth,"
9790,ARGUMENT,"A thousand mis'ries, day by day, endures."
9791,ARGUMENT,"Since thou detain'st me, then, and bidd'st me wait"
9792,ARGUMENT,"His coming, tell me if the father still                          420"
9793,ARGUMENT,"Of famed Ulysses live, whom, going hence,"
9794,ARGUMENT,He left so nearly on the verge of life?
9795,ARGUMENT,And lives his mother? or have both deceased
9796,ARGUMENT,"Already, and descended to the shades?"
9797,ARGUMENT,To whom the master swine-herd thus replied.
9798,ARGUMENT,"I will inform thee, and with strictest truth,"
9799,ARGUMENT,"Of all that thou hast ask'd. Laertes lives,"
9800,ARGUMENT,But supplication off'ring to the Gods
9801,ARGUMENT,"Ceaseless, to free him from a weary life,"
9802,ARGUMENT,"So deeply his long-absent son he mourns,                         430"
9803,ARGUMENT,"And the dear consort of his early youth,"
9804,ARGUMENT,"Whose death is his chief sorrow, and hath brought"
9805,ARGUMENT,"Old age on him, or ere its date arrived."
9806,ARGUMENT,"She died of sorrow for her glorious son,"
9807,ARGUMENT,And died deplorably;[67] may never friend
9808,ARGUMENT,"Of mine, or benefactor die as she!"
9809,ARGUMENT,"While yet she liv'd, dejected as she was,"
9810,ARGUMENT,I found it yet some solace to converse
9811,ARGUMENT,"With her, who rear'd me in my childish days,"
9812,ARGUMENT,Together with her lovely youngest-born                           440
9813,ARGUMENT,The Princess Ctimena; for side by side
9814,ARGUMENT,"We grew, and I, scarce honour'd less than she."
9815,ARGUMENT,But soon as our delightful prime we both
9816,ARGUMENT,"Attain'd, to Samos her they sent, a bride,"
9817,ARGUMENT,And were requited with rich dow'r; but me
9818,ARGUMENT,"Cloath'd handsomely with tunic and with vest,"
9819,ARGUMENT,"And with fair sandals furnish'd, to the field"
9820,ARGUMENT,"She order'd forth, yet loved me still the more."
9821,ARGUMENT,I miss her kindness now; but gracious heav'n
9822,ARGUMENT,Prospers the work on which I here attend;                        450
9823,ARGUMENT,"Hence have I food, and hence I drink, and hence"
9824,ARGUMENT,"Refresh, sometimes, a worthy guest like thee."
9825,ARGUMENT,"But kindness none experience I, or can,"
9826,ARGUMENT,From fair Penelope (my mistress now)
9827,ARGUMENT,"In word or action, so is the house curs'd"
9828,ARGUMENT,With that lewd throng. Glad would the servants be
9829,ARGUMENT,"Might they approach their mistress, and receive"
9830,ARGUMENT,"Advice from her; glad too to eat and drink,"
9831,ARGUMENT,"And somewhat bear each to his rural home,"
9832,ARGUMENT,For perquisites are ev'ry servant's joy.                         460
9833,ARGUMENT,"Then answer thus, Ulysses wise return'd."
9834,ARGUMENT,"Alas! good swain, Eumæus, how remote"
9835,ARGUMENT,From friends and country wast thou forced to roam
9836,ARGUMENT,Ev'n in thy infancy! But tell me true.
9837,ARGUMENT,"The city where thy parents dwelt, did foes"
9838,ARGUMENT,Pillage it? or did else some hostile band
9839,ARGUMENT,"Surprizing thee alone, on herd or flock"
9840,ARGUMENT,"Attendant, bear thee with them o'er the Deep,"
9841,ARGUMENT,"And sell thee at this Hero's house, who pay'd"
9842,ARGUMENT,Doubtless for _thee_ no sordid price or small?                   470
9843,ARGUMENT,To whom the master swine-herd in reply.
9844,ARGUMENT,Stranger! since thou art curious to be told
9845,ARGUMENT,"My story, silent listen, and thy wine"
9846,ARGUMENT,"At leisure quaff. The nights are longest now,"
9847,ARGUMENT,"And such as time for sleep afford, and time"
9848,ARGUMENT,For pleasant conf'rence; neither were it good
9849,ARGUMENT,"That thou should'st to thy couch before thy hour,"
9850,ARGUMENT,"Since even sleep is hurtful, in excess."
9851,ARGUMENT,"Whoever here is weary, and desires"
9852,ARGUMENT,"Early repose, let him depart to rest,                            480"
9853,ARGUMENT,"And, at the peep of day, when he hath fed"
9854,ARGUMENT,"Sufficiently, drive forth my master's herd;"
9855,ARGUMENT,But we with wine and a well-furnish'd board
9856,ARGUMENT,"Supplied, will solace mutually derive"
9857,ARGUMENT,From recollection of our sufferings past;
9858,ARGUMENT,"For who hath much endured, and wander'd far,"
9859,ARGUMENT,Finds the recital ev'n of sorrow sweet.
9860,ARGUMENT,Now hear thy question satisfied; attend!
9861,ARGUMENT,"There is an island (thou hast heard, perchance,"
9862,ARGUMENT,Of such an isle) named Syria;[68] it is placed                   490
9863,ARGUMENT,"Above Ortigia, and a dial owns[69]"
9864,ARGUMENT,True to the tropic changes of the year.
9865,ARGUMENT,"No great extent she boasts, yet is she rich"
9866,ARGUMENT,"In cattle and in flocks, in wheat and wine."
9867,ARGUMENT,"No famine knows that people, or disease"
9868,ARGUMENT,"Noisome, of all that elsewhere seize the race"
9869,ARGUMENT,Of miserable man; but when old age
9870,ARGUMENT,"Steals on the citizens, Apollo, arm'd"

9872,ARGUMENT,Whose gentle shafts dismiss them soon to rest.                   500
9873,ARGUMENT,"Two cities share between them all the isle,"
9874,ARGUMENT,And both were subject to my father's sway
9875,ARGUMENT,"Ctesius Ormenides, a godlike Chief."
9876,ARGUMENT,"It chanced that from Phœnicia, famed for skill"
9877,ARGUMENT,"In arts marine, a vessel thither came"
9878,ARGUMENT,"By sharpers mann'd, and laden deep with toys."
9879,ARGUMENT,"Now, in my father's family abode"
9880,ARGUMENT,"A fair Phœnician, tall, full-sized, and skill'd"
9881,ARGUMENT,"In works of elegance, whom they beguiled."
9882,ARGUMENT,"While she wash'd linen on the beach, beside                      510"
9883,ARGUMENT,"The ship, a certain mariner of those"

9886,ARGUMENT,"Who was she, he enquired, and whence? nor she"
9887,ARGUMENT,Scrupled to tell at once her father's home.
9888,ARGUMENT,"I am of Sidon,[70] famous for her works"
9889,ARGUMENT,"In brass and steel; daughter of Arybas,"
9890,ARGUMENT,Who rolls in affluence; Taphian pirates thence
9891,ARGUMENT,"Stole me returning from the field, from whom"
9892,ARGUMENT,This Chief procured me at no little cost.                        520
9893,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus her paramour return'd.
9894,ARGUMENT,"Wilt thou not hence to Sidon in our ship,"
9895,ARGUMENT,That thou may'st once more visit the abode
9896,ARGUMENT,"Of thy own wealthy parents, and themselves?"
9897,ARGUMENT,"For still they live, and still are wealthy deem'd."
9898,ARGUMENT,"To whom the woman. Even that might be,"
9899,ARGUMENT,"Would ye, ye seamen, by a solemn oath"
9900,ARGUMENT,Assure me of a safe conveyance home.
9901,ARGUMENT,"Then sware the mariners as she required,"
9902,ARGUMENT,"And, when their oath was ended, thus again                       530"
9903,ARGUMENT,The woman of Phœnicia them bespake.
9904,ARGUMENT,"Now, silence! no man, henceforth, of you all"
9905,ARGUMENT,"Accost me, though he meet me on the road,"
9906,ARGUMENT,Or at yon fountain; lest some tattler run
9907,ARGUMENT,"With tidings home to my old master's ear,"
9908,ARGUMENT,"Who, with suspicion touch'd, may _me_ confine"
9909,ARGUMENT,"In cruel bonds, and death contrive for _you_."
9910,ARGUMENT,But be ye close; purchase your stores in haste;
9911,ARGUMENT,"And when your vessel shall be freighted full,"
9912,ARGUMENT,"Quick send me notice, for I mean to bring                        540"
9913,ARGUMENT,"What gold soever opportune I find,"
9914,ARGUMENT,And will my passage cheerfully defray
9915,ARGUMENT,With still another moveable. I nurse
9916,ARGUMENT,"The good man's son, an urchin shrewd, of age"
9917,ARGUMENT,"To scamper at my side; him will I bring,"
9918,ARGUMENT,Whom at some foreign market ye shall prove
9919,ARGUMENT,Saleable at what price soe'er ye will.
9920,ARGUMENT,"So saying, she to my father's house return'd."
9921,ARGUMENT,"They, there abiding the whole year, their ship"
9922,ARGUMENT,"With purchased goods freighted of ev'ry kind,                    550"
9923,ARGUMENT,"And when, her lading now complete, she lay"
9924,ARGUMENT,"For sea prepared, their messenger arrived"
9925,ARGUMENT,To summon down the woman to the shore.
9926,ARGUMENT,"A mariner of theirs, subtle and shrewd,"
9927,ARGUMENT,"Then, ent'ring at my father's gate, produced"
9928,ARGUMENT,"A splendid collar, gold with amber strung."
9929,ARGUMENT,My mother (then at home) with all her maids
9930,ARGUMENT,"Handling and gazing on it with delight,"
9931,ARGUMENT,"Proposed to purchase it, and he the nod"
9932,ARGUMENT,"Significant, gave unobserv'd, the while,                         560"
9933,ARGUMENT,"To the Phœnician woman, and return'd."
9934,ARGUMENT,"She, thus informed, leading me by the hand"
9935,ARGUMENT,"Went forth, and finding in the vestibule"
9936,ARGUMENT,The cups and tables which my father's guests
9937,ARGUMENT,"Had used, (but they were to the forum gone"
9938,ARGUMENT,For converse with their friends assembled there)
9939,ARGUMENT,"Convey'd three cups into her bosom-folds,"
9940,ARGUMENT,"And bore them off, whom I a thoughtless child"
9941,ARGUMENT,"Accompanied, at the decline of day,"
9942,ARGUMENT,When dusky evening had embrown'd the shore.                      570
9943,ARGUMENT,"We, stepping nimbly on, soon reach'd the port"
9944,ARGUMENT,"Renown'd, where that Phœnician vessel lay."
9945,ARGUMENT,"They shipp'd us both, and all embarking cleav'd"
9946,ARGUMENT,"Their liquid road, by favourable gales,"
9947,ARGUMENT,"Jove's gift, impell'd. Six days we day and night"
9948,ARGUMENT,"Continual sailed, but when Saturnian Jove"
9949,ARGUMENT,"Now bade the sev'nth bright morn illume the skies,"
9950,ARGUMENT,"Then, shaft-arm'd Dian struck the woman dead."
9951,ARGUMENT,At once she pitch'd headlong into the bilge
9952,ARGUMENT,"Like a sea-coot, whence heaving her again,                       580"
9953,ARGUMENT,"The seamen gave her to be fishes' food,"
9954,ARGUMENT,And I survived to mourn her. But the winds
9955,ARGUMENT,And rolling billows them bore to the coast
9956,ARGUMENT,"Of Ithaca, where with his proper goods"
9957,ARGUMENT,Laertes bought me. By such means it chanced
9958,ARGUMENT,That e'er I saw the isle in which I dwell.
9959,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, glorious Chief, replied."
9960,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus! thou hast moved me much, thy woes"
9961,ARGUMENT,Enumerating thus at large. But Jove
9962,ARGUMENT,"Hath neighbour'd all thy evil with this good,                    590"
9963,ARGUMENT,That after num'rous sorrows thou hast reach'd
9964,ARGUMENT,"The house of a kind master, at whose hands"
9965,ARGUMENT,"Thy sustenance is sure, and here thou lead'st"
9966,ARGUMENT,"A tranquil life; but I have late arrived,"
9967,ARGUMENT,City after city of the world explored.
9968,ARGUMENT,"Thus mutual they conferr'd, nor leisure found"
9969,ARGUMENT,"Save for short sleep, by morning soon surprized."
9970,ARGUMENT,Meantime the comrades of Telemachus
9971,ARGUMENT,"Approaching land, cast loose the sail, and lower'd"
9972,ARGUMENT,"Alert the mast, then oar'd the vessel in.                        600"
9973,ARGUMENT,"The anchors heav'd aground,[71] and hawsers tied"
9974,ARGUMENT,"Secure, themselves, forth-issuing on the shore,"
9975,ARGUMENT,"Breakfast prepared, and charged their cups with wine."
9976,ARGUMENT,"When neither hunger now, nor thirst remained"
9977,ARGUMENT,"Unsatisfied, Telemachus began."
9978,ARGUMENT,Push ye the sable bark without delay
9979,ARGUMENT,Home to the city. I will to the field
9980,ARGUMENT,"Among my shepherds, and, (my rural works"
9981,ARGUMENT,"Survey'd,) at eve will to the town return."
9982,ARGUMENT,To-morrow will I set before you wine                             610
9983,ARGUMENT,"And plenteous viands, wages of your toil."
9984,ARGUMENT,To whom the godlike Theoclymenus.
9985,ARGUMENT,"Whither must I, my son? who, of the Chiefs"
9986,ARGUMENT,"Of rugged Ithaca, shall harbour me?"
9987,ARGUMENT,Shall I to thine and to thy mother's house?
9988,ARGUMENT,"Then thus Telemachus, discrete, replied."
9989,ARGUMENT,I would invite thee to proceed at once
9990,ARGUMENT,"To our abode, since nought should fail thee there"
9991,ARGUMENT,"Of kind reception, but it were a course"
9992,ARGUMENT,"Now not adviseable; for I must myself,                           620"
9993,ARGUMENT,"Be absent, neither would my mother's eyes"
9994,ARGUMENT,"Behold thee, so unfrequent she appears"
9995,ARGUMENT,"Before the suitors, shunning whom, she sits"
9996,ARGUMENT,Weaving continual at the palace-top.
9997,ARGUMENT,But I will name to thee another Chief
9998,ARGUMENT,"Whom thou may'st seek, Eurymachus, the son"
9999,ARGUMENT,"Renown'd of prudent Polybus, whom all"
10000,ARGUMENT,The people here reverence as a God.
10001,ARGUMENT,"Far noblest of them all is he, and seeks"
10002,ARGUMENT,"More ardent than his rivals far, to wed                          630"
10003,ARGUMENT,"My mother, and to fill my father's throne."
10004,ARGUMENT,"But, He who dwells above, Jove only knows"
10005,ARGUMENT,If some disastrous day be not ordain'd
10006,ARGUMENT,"For them, or ere those nuptials shall arrive."
10007,ARGUMENT,"While thus he spake, at his right hand appear'd,"
10008,ARGUMENT,"Messenger of Apollo, on full wing,"
10009,ARGUMENT,A falcon; in his pounces clench'd he bore
10010,ARGUMENT,"A dove, which rending, down he pour'd her plumes"
10011,ARGUMENT,Between the galley and Telemachus.
10012,ARGUMENT,"Then, calling him apart, the prophet lock'd                      640"
10013,ARGUMENT,"His hand in his, and thus explain'd the sign."
10014,ARGUMENT,Not undirected by the Gods his flight
10015,ARGUMENT,"On our right hand, Telemachus! this hawk"
10016,ARGUMENT,Hath wing'd propitious; soon as I perceived
10017,ARGUMENT,I knew him ominous--In all the isle
10018,ARGUMENT,No family of a more royal note
10019,ARGUMENT,"Than yours is found, and yours shall still prevail."
10020,ARGUMENT,Whom thus Telemachus answer'd discrete.
10021,ARGUMENT,"Grant heav'n, my guest! that this good word of thine"
10022,ARGUMENT,"Fail not, and soon thou shalt such bounty share                  650"
10023,ARGUMENT,"And friendship at my hands, that, at first sight,"
10024,ARGUMENT,Whoe'er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest.
10025,ARGUMENT,"Then, to Piræus thus, his friend approved."
10026,ARGUMENT,"Piræus, son of Clytius! (for of all"
10027,ARGUMENT,"My followers to the shore of Pylus, none"
10028,ARGUMENT,More prompt than thou hath my desires perform'd)
10029,ARGUMENT,Now also to thy own abode conduct
10030,ARGUMENT,"This stranger, whom with hospitable care"
10031,ARGUMENT,Cherish and honour till myself arrive.
10032,ARGUMENT,"To whom Piræus answer'd, spear-renown'd.                       660"
10033,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus! however long thy stay,"
10034,ARGUMENT,"Punctual I will attend him, and no want"
10035,ARGUMENT,Of hospitality shall he find with me.
10036,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he climb'd the ship, then bade the crew"
10037,ARGUMENT,"Embarking also, cast the hawsers loose,"
10038,ARGUMENT,"And each, obedient, to his bench repair'd."
10039,ARGUMENT,"Meantime Telemachus his sandals bound,"
10040,ARGUMENT,And lifted from the deck his glitt'ring spear.
10041,ARGUMENT,"Then, as Telemachus had bidden them,"
10042,ARGUMENT,"Son of divine Ulysses, casting loose                             670"
10043,ARGUMENT,"The hawsers, forth they push'd into the Deep"
10044,ARGUMENT,"And sought the city, while with nimble pace"
10045,ARGUMENT,"Proceeding thence, Telemachus attain'd"
10046,ARGUMENT,"The cottage soon where good Eumæus slept,"
10047,ARGUMENT,"The swine-herd, faithful to his num'rous charge."

10092,ARGUMENT,
10093,ARGUMENT,"It was the hour of dawn, when in the cot"
10094,ARGUMENT,"Kindling fresh fire, Ulysses and his friend"
10095,ARGUMENT,"Noble Eumæus dress'd their morning fare,"
10096,ARGUMENT,And sent the herdsmen with the swine abroad.
10097,ARGUMENT,"Seeing Telemachus, the watchful dogs"
10098,ARGUMENT,"Bark'd not, but fawn'd around him. At that sight,"
10099,ARGUMENT,"And at the sound of feet which now approach'd,"
10100,ARGUMENT,Ulysses in wing'd accents thus remark'd.
10101,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus! certain, either friend of thine"
10102,ARGUMENT,"Is nigh at hand, or one whom well thou know'st;                   10"

10150,ARGUMENT,"Green twigs beneath, which, cover'd with a fleece,"
10151,ARGUMENT,Supplied Ulysses' offspring with a seat.

10153,ARGUMENT,"With relicts charged of yesterday; with bread,"

10164,ARGUMENT,"For, that on foot he found us not, is sure."

10167,ARGUMENT,He boasts him sprung from ancestry renown'd

10170,ARGUMENT,"Ev'n now, from a Thesprotian ship escaped,"

10173,ARGUMENT,"He is thy suppliant, and depends on thee."
10174,ARGUMENT,"Then thus, Telemachus, discrete, replied."
10175,ARGUMENT,"Thy words, Eumæus, pain my very soul."
10176,ARGUMENT,For what security can I afford
10177,ARGUMENT,"To any in my house? myself am young,"
10178,ARGUMENT,Nor yet of strength sufficient to repel
10179,ARGUMENT,"An offer'd insult, and my mother's mind"
10180,ARGUMENT,"In doubtful balance hangs, if, still with me"
10181,ARGUMENT,"An inmate, she shall manage my concerns,"
10182,ARGUMENT,Attentive only to her absent Lord                                 90
10183,ARGUMENT,"And her own good report, or shall espouse"
10184,ARGUMENT,"The noblest of her wooers, and the best"
10185,ARGUMENT,Entitled by the splendour of his gifts.
10186,ARGUMENT,"But I will give him, since I find him lodg'd"
10187,ARGUMENT,"A guest beneath thy roof, tunic and cloak,"
10188,ARGUMENT,"Sword double-edged, and sandals for his feet,"
10189,ARGUMENT,With convoy to the country of his choice.
10190,ARGUMENT,"Still, if it please thee, keep him here thy guest,"
10191,ARGUMENT,"And I will send him raiment, with supplies"
10192,ARGUMENT,"Of all sorts, lest he burthen thee and thine.                    100"
10193,ARGUMENT,"But where the suitors come, there shall not he"
10194,ARGUMENT,"With my consent, nor stand exposed to pride"
10195,ARGUMENT,"And petulance like theirs, lest by some sneer"
10196,ARGUMENT,"They wound him, and through him, wound also me;"
10197,ARGUMENT,For little is it that the boldest can
10198,ARGUMENT,Against so many; numbers will prevail.

10200,ARGUMENT,Oh amiable and good! since even I
10201,ARGUMENT,"Am free to answer thee, I will avow"
10202,ARGUMENT,My heart within me torn by what I hear                           110
10203,ARGUMENT,"Of those injurious suitors, who the house"
10204,ARGUMENT,Infest of one noble as thou appear'st.

10207,ARGUMENT,"By some response oracular, incline"
10208,ARGUMENT,"Against thee? Thou hast brothers, it may chance,"
10209,ARGUMENT,Slow to assist thee--for a brother's aid
10210,ARGUMENT,Is of importance in whatever cause.

10212,ARGUMENT,"Or that renown'd Ulysses were my sire,                           120"
10213,ARGUMENT,Or that himself might wander home again.
10214,ARGUMENT,Whereof hope yet remains! then might I lose
10215,ARGUMENT,"My head, that moment, by an alien's hand,"
10216,ARGUMENT,"If I would fail, ent'ring Ulysses' gate,"
10217,ARGUMENT,To be the bane and mischief of them all.
10218,ARGUMENT,But if alone to multitudes opposed
10219,ARGUMENT,I should perchance be foiled; nobler it were
10220,ARGUMENT,"With my own people, under my own roof"
10221,ARGUMENT,"To perish, than to witness evermore"
10222,ARGUMENT,"Their unexampled deeds, guests shoved aside,                     130"
10223,ARGUMENT,"Maidens dragg'd forcibly from room to room,"
10224,ARGUMENT,"Casks emptied of their rich contents, and them"
10225,ARGUMENT,Indulging glutt'nous appetite day by day
10226,ARGUMENT,"Enormous, without measure, without end."
10227,ARGUMENT,"To whom, Telemachus, discrete, replied."
10228,ARGUMENT,Stranger! thy questions shall from me receive
10229,ARGUMENT,True answer. Enmity or hatred none
10230,ARGUMENT,"Subsists the people and myself between,"
10231,ARGUMENT,"Nor have I brothers to accuse, whose aid"
10232,ARGUMENT,"Is of importance in whatever cause,                              140"
10233,ARGUMENT,For Jove hath from of old with single heirs
10234,ARGUMENT,Our house supplied; Arcesias none begat
10235,ARGUMENT,"Except Laertes, and Laertes none"
10236,ARGUMENT,"Except Ulysses, and Ulysses me"
10237,ARGUMENT,"Left here his only one, and unenjoy'd."
10238,ARGUMENT,Thence comes it that our palace swarms with foes;
10239,ARGUMENT,"For all the rulers of the neighbour isles,"
10240,ARGUMENT,"Samos, Dulichium, and the forest-crown'd"
10241,ARGUMENT,"Zacynthus, others also rulers here"
10242,ARGUMENT,"In craggy Ithaca, my mother seek                                 150"
10243,ARGUMENT,"In marriage, and my household stores consume."
10244,ARGUMENT,But neither she those nuptial rites abhorr'd
10245,ARGUMENT,"Refuses absolute, nor yet consents"
10246,ARGUMENT,To end them; they my patrimony waste
10247,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, and will destroy me also soon,"
10248,ARGUMENT,"As I expect, but heav'n disposes all."
10249,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus! haste, my father! bear with speed"
10250,ARGUMENT,"News to Penelope that I am safe,"
10251,ARGUMENT,And have arrived from Pylus; I will wait
10252,ARGUMENT,Till thou return; and well beware that none
10253,ARGUMENT,"Hear thee beside, for I have many foes."
10254,ARGUMENT,"To whom Eumæus, thou didst thus reply."
10255,ARGUMENT,It is enough. I understand. Thou speak'st
10256,ARGUMENT,"To one intelligent. But say beside,"
10257,ARGUMENT,"Shall I not also, as I go, inform"
10258,ARGUMENT,Distress'd Laertes? who while yet he mourn'd
10259,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses only, could o'ersee the works,"
10260,ARGUMENT,And dieted among his menials oft
10261,ARGUMENT,"As hunger prompted him, but now, they say,"
10262,ARGUMENT,"Since thy departure to the Pylian shore,                         170"
10263,ARGUMENT,"He neither eats as he was wont, nor drinks,"
10264,ARGUMENT,"Nor oversees his hinds, but sighing sits"
10265,ARGUMENT,"And weeping, wasted even to the bone."
10266,ARGUMENT,Him then Telemachus answer'd discrete.
10267,ARGUMENT,"Hard though it be, yet to his tears and sighs"
10268,ARGUMENT,Him leave we now. We cannot what we would.
10269,ARGUMENT,"For, were the ordering of all events"
10270,ARGUMENT,"Referr'd to our own choice, our first desire"
10271,ARGUMENT,Should be to see my father's glad return.
10272,ARGUMENT,"But once thy tidings told, wander not thou                       180"
10273,ARGUMENT,"In quest of Him, but hither speed again."
10274,ARGUMENT,Rather request my mother that she send
10275,ARGUMENT,Her household's governess without delay
10276,ARGUMENT,Privately to him; she shall best inform
10277,ARGUMENT,The ancient King that I have safe arrived.
10278,ARGUMENT,"He said, and urged him forth, who binding on"
10279,ARGUMENT,"His sandals, to the city bent his way."
10280,ARGUMENT,Nor went Eumæus from his home unmark'd
10281,ARGUMENT,"By Pallas, who in semblance of a fair"
10282,ARGUMENT,"Damsel, accomplish'd in domestic arts,                           190"
10283,ARGUMENT,"Approaching to the cottage' entrance, stood"
10284,ARGUMENT,"Opposite, by Ulysses plain discern'd,"
10285,ARGUMENT,But to his son invisible; for the Gods
10286,ARGUMENT,Appear not manifest alike to all.
10287,ARGUMENT,"The mastiffs saw her also, and with tone"
10288,ARGUMENT,"Querulous hid themselves, yet bark'd they not."
10289,ARGUMENT,She beckon'd him abroad. Ulysses saw
10290,ARGUMENT,"The sign, and, issuing through the outer court,"
10291,ARGUMENT,"Approach'd her, whom the Goddess thus bespake."
10292,ARGUMENT,"Laertes' progeny, for wiles renown'd!                          200"
10293,ARGUMENT,"Disclose thyself to thy own son, that, death"
10294,ARGUMENT,"Concerting and destruction to your foes,"
10295,ARGUMENT,"Ye may the royal city seek, nor long"
10296,ARGUMENT,"Shall ye my presence there desire in vain,"
10297,ARGUMENT,For I am ardent to begin the fight.
10298,ARGUMENT,"Minerva spake, and with her rod of gold"
10299,ARGUMENT,"Touch'd him; his mantle, first, and vest she made"
10300,ARGUMENT,"Pure as new-blanch'd; dilating, next, his form,"
10301,ARGUMENT,She gave dimensions ampler to his limbs;
10302,ARGUMENT,"Swarthy again his manly hue became,                              210"
10303,ARGUMENT,"Round his full face, and black his bushy chin."
10304,ARGUMENT,"The change perform'd, Minerva disappear'd,"
10305,ARGUMENT,And the illustrious Hero turn'd again
10306,ARGUMENT,Into the cottage; wonder at that sight
10307,ARGUMENT,"Seiz'd on Telemachus; askance he look'd,"
10308,ARGUMENT,"Awe-struck, not unsuspicious of a God,"
10309,ARGUMENT,And in wing'd accents eager thus began.
10310,ARGUMENT,"Thou art no longer, whom I lately saw,"
10311,ARGUMENT,"Nor are thy cloaths, nor is thy port the same."
10312,ARGUMENT,"Thou art a God, I know, and dwell'st in heav'n.                  220"
10313,ARGUMENT,"Oh, smile on us, that we may yield thee rites"
10314,ARGUMENT,"Acceptable, and present thee golden gifts"
10315,ARGUMENT,"Elaborate; ah spare us, Pow'r divine!"
10316,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, Hero toil-inured."
10317,ARGUMENT,I am no God. Why deem'st thou me divine?
10318,ARGUMENT,"I am thy father, for whose sake thou lead'st"
10319,ARGUMENT,"A life of woe, by violence oppress'd."
10320,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he kiss'd his son, while from his cheeks"
10321,ARGUMENT,"Tears trickled, tears till then, perforce restrained."
10322,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, (for he believed him not                             230"
10323,ARGUMENT,"His father yet) thus, wond'ring, spake again."
10324,ARGUMENT,"My father, said'st thou? no. Thou art not He,"
10325,ARGUMENT,But some Divinity beguiles my soul
10326,ARGUMENT,With mock'ries to afflict me still the more;
10327,ARGUMENT,For never mortal man could so have wrought
10328,ARGUMENT,By his own pow'r; some interposing God
10329,ARGUMENT,"Alone could render thee both young and old,"
10330,ARGUMENT,"For old thou wast of late, and foully clad,"
10331,ARGUMENT,"But wear'st the semblance, now, of those in heav'n!"
10332,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.                           240"
10333,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus! it is not well, my son!"
10334,ARGUMENT,That thou should'st greet thy father with a face
10335,ARGUMENT,"Of wild astonishment, and stand aghast."
10336,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, save myself, none comes, be sure."
10337,ARGUMENT,"Such as thou seest, after ten thousand woes"
10338,ARGUMENT,"Which I have borne, I visit once again"
10339,ARGUMENT,My native country in the twentieth year.
10340,ARGUMENT,"This wonder Athenæan Pallas wrought,"
10341,ARGUMENT,"She cloath'd me even with what form she would,"
10342,ARGUMENT,"For so she can. Now poor I seem and old,                         250"
10343,ARGUMENT,"Now young again, and clad in fresh attire."
10344,ARGUMENT,"The Gods who dwell in yonder heav'n, with ease"
10345,ARGUMENT,Dignify or debase a mortal man.
10346,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he sat. Then threw Telemachus"
10347,ARGUMENT,"His arms around his father's neck, and wept."
10348,ARGUMENT,Desire intense of lamentation seized
10349,ARGUMENT,"On both; soft murmurs utt'ring, each indulged"
10350,ARGUMENT,"His grief, more frequent wailing than the bird,"
10351,ARGUMENT,"(Eagle, or hook-nail'd vulture) from whose nest"
10352,ARGUMENT,Some swain hath stol'n her yet unfeather'd young.                260
10353,ARGUMENT,So from their eyelids they big drops distill'd
10354,ARGUMENT,"Of tend'rest grief, nor had the setting sun"
10355,ARGUMENT,"Cessation of their weeping seen, had not"
10356,ARGUMENT,Telemachus his father thus address'd.
10357,ARGUMENT,"What ship convey'd thee to thy native shore,"
10358,ARGUMENT,My father! and what country boast the crew?
10359,ARGUMENT,"For, that on foot thou not arriv'dst, is sure."
10360,ARGUMENT,Then thus divine Ulysses toil-inured.
10361,ARGUMENT,My son! I will explicit all relate.
10362,ARGUMENT,Conducted by Phæacia's maritime sons                             270
10363,ARGUMENT,"I came, a race accustom'd to convey"
10364,ARGUMENT,Strangers who visit them across the Deep.
10365,ARGUMENT,"Me, o'er the billows in a rapid bark"
10366,ARGUMENT,"Borne sleeping, on the shores of Ithaca"
10367,ARGUMENT,"They lay'd; rich gifts they gave me also, brass,"
10368,ARGUMENT,"Gold in full bags, and beautiful attire,"
10369,ARGUMENT,"Which, warn'd from heav'n, I have in caves conceal'd."
10370,ARGUMENT,"By Pallas prompted, hither I repair'd"
10371,ARGUMENT,"That we might plan the slaughter of our foes,"
10372,ARGUMENT,"Whose numbers tell me now, that I may know                       280"
10373,ARGUMENT,"How pow'rful, certainly, and who they are,"
10374,ARGUMENT,And consultation with my dauntless heart
10375,ARGUMENT,"May hold, if we be able to contend"
10376,ARGUMENT,"Ourselves with all, or must have aid beside."
10377,ARGUMENT,"Then, answer thus his son, discrete, return'd."
10378,ARGUMENT,My father! thy renown hath ever rung
10379,ARGUMENT,"In thy son's ears, and by report thy force"
10380,ARGUMENT,"In arms, and wisdom I have oft been told."
10381,ARGUMENT,But terribly thou speak'st; amazement-fixt
10382,ARGUMENT,"I hear; can two a multitude oppose,                              290"
10383,ARGUMENT,And valiant warriors all? for neither ten
10384,ARGUMENT,"Are they, nor twenty, but more num'rous far."
10385,ARGUMENT,"Learn, now, their numbers. Fifty youths and two"
10386,ARGUMENT,"Came from Dulichium; they are chosen men,"
10387,ARGUMENT,And six attendants follow in their train;
10388,ARGUMENT,"From Samos twenty youths and four arrive,"
10389,ARGUMENT,Zacynthus also of Achaia's sons
10390,ARGUMENT,"Sends twenty more, and our own island adds,"
10391,ARGUMENT,"Herself, her twelve chief rulers; Medon, too,"
10392,ARGUMENT,"Is there the herald, and the bard divine,                        300"
10393,ARGUMENT,"With other two, intendants of the board."
10394,ARGUMENT,"Should we within the palace, we alone,"
10395,ARGUMENT,"Assail them all, I fear lest thy revenge"
10396,ARGUMENT,"Unpleasant to thyself and deadly prove,"
10397,ARGUMENT,Frustrating thy return. But recollect--
10398,ARGUMENT,"Think, if thou canst, on whose confed'rate arm"
10399,ARGUMENT,Strenuous on our behalf we may rely.
10400,ARGUMENT,To him replied his patient father bold.
10401,ARGUMENT,I will inform thee. Mark. Weigh well my words.
10402,ARGUMENT,Will Pallas and the everlasting Sire                             310
10403,ARGUMENT,Alone suffice? or need we other aids?
10404,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus Telemachus return'd.
10405,ARGUMENT,"Good friends indeed are they whom thou hast named,"
10406,ARGUMENT,Though throned above the clouds; for their controul
10407,ARGUMENT,Is universal both in earth and heav'n.
10408,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, toil-worn Chief renown'd."
10409,ARGUMENT,"Not long will they from battle stand aloof,"
10410,ARGUMENT,"When once, within my palace, in the strength"
10411,ARGUMENT,"Of Mars, to sharp decision we shall urge"
10412,ARGUMENT,The suitors. But thyself at early dawn                           320
10413,ARGUMENT,"Our mansion seek, that thou may'st mingle there"
10414,ARGUMENT,With that imperious throng; me in due time
10415,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus to the city shall conduct,"
10416,ARGUMENT,In form a miserable beggar old.
10417,ARGUMENT,But should they with dishonourable scorn
10418,ARGUMENT,"Insult me, thou unmov'd my wrongs endure,"
10419,ARGUMENT,And should they even drag me by the feet
10420,ARGUMENT,"Abroad, or smite me with the spear, thy wrath"
10421,ARGUMENT,"Refraining, gently counsel them to cease"
10422,ARGUMENT,From such extravagance; but well I know                          330
10423,ARGUMENT,"That cease they will not, for their hour is come."
10424,ARGUMENT,And mark me well; treasure what now I say
10425,ARGUMENT,"Deep in thy soul. When Pallas shall, herself,"
10426,ARGUMENT,"Suggest the measure, then, shaking my brows,"
10427,ARGUMENT,"I will admonish thee; thou, at the sign,"
10428,ARGUMENT,Remove what arms soever in the hall
10429,ARGUMENT,"Remain, and in the upper palace safe"
10430,ARGUMENT,"Dispose them; should the suitors, missing them,"
10431,ARGUMENT,"Perchance interrogate thee, then reply"
10432,ARGUMENT,Gently--I have removed them from the smoke;                      340
10433,ARGUMENT,For they appear no more the arms which erst
10434,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, going hence to Ilium, left,"
10435,ARGUMENT,But smirch'd and sullied by the breath of fire.
10436,ARGUMENT,This weightier reason (thou shalt also say)
10437,ARGUMENT,"Jove taught me; lest, intoxicate with wine,"
10438,ARGUMENT,"Ye should assault each other in your brawls,"
10439,ARGUMENT,Shaming both feast and courtship; for the view
10440,ARGUMENT,Itself of arms incites to their abuse.
10441,ARGUMENT,"Yet leave two faulchions for ourselves alone,"
10442,ARGUMENT,"Two spears, two bucklers, which with sudden force                350"
10443,ARGUMENT,"Impetuous we will seize, and Jove all-wise"
10444,ARGUMENT,"Their valour shall, and Pallas, steal away."
10445,ARGUMENT,This word store also in remembrance deep--
10446,ARGUMENT,"If mine in truth thou art, and of my blood,"
10447,ARGUMENT,"Then, of Ulysses to his home returned"
10448,ARGUMENT,"Let none hear news from thee, no, not my sire"
10449,ARGUMENT,"Laertes, nor Eumæus, nor of all"
10450,ARGUMENT,"The menials any, or ev'n Penelope,"
10451,ARGUMENT,"That thou and I, alone, may search the drift"
10452,ARGUMENT,"Of our domestic women, and may prove                             360"
10453,ARGUMENT,"Our serving-men, who honours and reveres"
10454,ARGUMENT,"And who contemns us both, but chiefly thee"
10455,ARGUMENT,So gracious and so worthy to be loved.
10456,ARGUMENT,Him then thus answer'd his illustrious son.
10457,ARGUMENT,"Trust me, my father! thou shalt soon be taught"
10458,ARGUMENT,That I am not of drowsy mind obtuse.
10459,ARGUMENT,But this I think not likely to avail
10460,ARGUMENT,Or thee or me; ponder it yet again;
10461,ARGUMENT,"For tedious were the task, farm after farm"
10462,ARGUMENT,"To visit of those servants, proving each,                        370"
10463,ARGUMENT,And the proud suitors merciless devour
10464,ARGUMENT,"Meantime thy substance, nor abstain from aught."
10465,ARGUMENT,"Learn, if thou wilt, (and I that course myself"
10466,ARGUMENT,"Advise) who slights thee of the female train,"
10467,ARGUMENT,And who is guiltless; but I would not try
10468,ARGUMENT,"From house to house the men, far better proved"
10469,ARGUMENT,"Hereafter, if in truth by signs from heav'n"
10470,ARGUMENT,"Inform'd, thou hast been taught the will of Jove."
10471,ARGUMENT,"Thus they conferr'd. The gallant bark, meantime,"
10472,ARGUMENT,"Reach'd Ithaca, which from the Pylian shore                      380"
10473,ARGUMENT,Had brought Telemachus with all his band.
10474,ARGUMENT,Within the many-fathom'd port arrived
10475,ARGUMENT,"His lusty followers haled her far aground,"
10476,ARGUMENT,"Then carried thence their arms, but to the house"
10477,ARGUMENT,Of Clytius the illustrious gifts convey'd.
10478,ARGUMENT,Next to the royal mansion they dispatch'd
10479,ARGUMENT,"An herald charg'd with tidings to the Queen,"
10480,ARGUMENT,That her Telemachus had reach'd the cot
10481,ARGUMENT,"Of good Eumæus, and the bark had sent"
10482,ARGUMENT,Home to the city; lest the matchless dame                        390
10483,ARGUMENT,Should still deplore the absence of her son.
10484,ARGUMENT,"They, then, the herald and the swine-herd, each"
10485,ARGUMENT,"Bearing like message to his mistress, met,"
10486,ARGUMENT,And at the palace of the godlike Chief
10487,ARGUMENT,"Arriving, compass'd by the female throng"
10488,ARGUMENT,"Inquisitive, the herald thus began."
10489,ARGUMENT,"Thy son, O Queen! is safe; ev'n now return'd."
10490,ARGUMENT,"Then, drawing nigh to her, Eumæus told"
10491,ARGUMENT,"His message also from her son received,"
10492,ARGUMENT,"And, his commission punctually discharged,                       400"
10493,ARGUMENT,"Leaving the palace, sought his home again."
10494,ARGUMENT,"Grief seized and anguish, at those tidings, all"
10495,ARGUMENT,"The suitors; issuing forth, on the outside"
10496,ARGUMENT,"Of the high wall they sat, before the gate,"
10497,ARGUMENT,"When Polybus' son, Eurymachus, began."
10498,ARGUMENT,"My friends! his arduous task, this voyage, deem'd"
10499,ARGUMENT,"By us impossible, in our despight"
10500,ARGUMENT,Telemachus hath atchieved. Haste! launch we forth
10501,ARGUMENT,"A sable bark, our best, which let us man"
10502,ARGUMENT,"With mariners expert, who, rowing forth                          410"
10503,ARGUMENT,"Swiftly, shall summon our companions home."
10504,ARGUMENT,"Scarce had he said, when turning where he sat,"
10505,ARGUMENT,Amphinomus beheld a bark arrived
10506,ARGUMENT,"Just then in port; he saw them furling sail,"
10507,ARGUMENT,And seated with their oars in hand; he laugh'd
10508,ARGUMENT,"Through pleasure at that sight, and thus he spake."
10509,ARGUMENT,Our message may be spared. Lo! they arrive.
10510,ARGUMENT,"Either some God inform'd them, or they saw,"
10511,ARGUMENT,"Themselves, the vessel of Telemachus"
10512,ARGUMENT,Too swiftly passing to be reach'd by theirs.                     420
10513,ARGUMENT,"He spake; they, rising, hasted to the shore."
10514,ARGUMENT,"Alert they drew the sable bark aground,"
10515,ARGUMENT,And by his servant each his arms dispatch'd
10516,ARGUMENT,"To his own home. Then, all, to council those"
10517,ARGUMENT,"Assembling, neither elder of the land"
10518,ARGUMENT,"Nor youth allow'd to join them, and the rest"
10519,ARGUMENT,"Eupithes' son, Antinoüs, thus bespake."
10520,ARGUMENT,Ah! how the Gods have rescued him! all day
10521,ARGUMENT,"Perch'd on the airy mountain-top, our spies"
10522,ARGUMENT,"Successive watch'd; and, when the sun declined,                  430"
10523,ARGUMENT,"We never slept on shore, but all night long"
10524,ARGUMENT,"Till sacred dawn arose, plow'd the abyss,"
10525,ARGUMENT,"Hoping Telemachus, that we might seize"
10526,ARGUMENT,"And slay him, whom some Deity hath led,"
10527,ARGUMENT,"In our despight, safe to his home again."
10528,ARGUMENT,But frame we yet again means to destroy
10529,ARGUMENT,Telemachus; ah--let not Him escape!
10530,ARGUMENT,"For end of this our task, while he survives,"
10531,ARGUMENT,"None shall be found, such prudence he displays"
10532,ARGUMENT,"And wisdom, neither are the people now                           440"
10533,ARGUMENT,Unanimous our friends as heretofore.
10534,ARGUMENT,"Come, then--prevent him, ere he call the Greeks"
10535,ARGUMENT,"To council; for he will not long delay,"
10536,ARGUMENT,"But will be angry, doubtless, and will tell"
10537,ARGUMENT,"Amid them all, how we in vain devised"
10538,ARGUMENT,"His death, a deed which they will scarce applaud,"
10539,ARGUMENT,"But will, perhaps, punish and drive us forth"
10540,ARGUMENT,From our own country to a distant land.--
10541,ARGUMENT,"Prevent him, therefore, quickly; in the field"
10542,ARGUMENT,"Slay him, or on the road; so shall his wealth                    450"
10543,ARGUMENT,And his possessions on ourselves devolve
10544,ARGUMENT,"Which we will share equally, but his house"
10545,ARGUMENT,"Shall be the Queen's, and his whom she shall wed."
10546,ARGUMENT,"Yet, if not so inclined, ye rather chuse"
10547,ARGUMENT,That he should live and occupy entire
10548,ARGUMENT,"His patrimony, then, no longer, here"
10549,ARGUMENT,"Assembled, let us revel at his cost,"
10550,ARGUMENT,But let us all with spousal gifts produced
10551,ARGUMENT,"From our respective treasures, woo the Queen,"
10552,ARGUMENT,Leaving her in full freedom to espouse                           460
10553,ARGUMENT,"Who proffers most, and whom the fates ordain."
10554,ARGUMENT,He ceased; the assembly silent sat and mute.
10555,ARGUMENT,"Then rose Amphinomus amid them all,"
10556,ARGUMENT,"Offspring renown'd of Nisus, son, himself,"
10557,ARGUMENT,Of King Aretias. He had thither led
10558,ARGUMENT,The suitor train who from the pleasant isle
10559,ARGUMENT,"Corn-clad of green Dulichium had arrived,"
10560,ARGUMENT,And by his speech pleased far beyond them all
10561,ARGUMENT,"Penelope, for he was just and wise,"
10562,ARGUMENT,"And thus, well-counselling the rest, began.                      470"
10563,ARGUMENT,"Not I, my friends! far be the thought from me"
10564,ARGUMENT,To slay Telemachus! it were a deed
10565,ARGUMENT,"Momentous, terrible, to slay a prince."
10566,ARGUMENT,"First, therefore, let us counsel ask of heav'n,"
10567,ARGUMENT,"And if Jove's oracle that course approve,"
10568,ARGUMENT,"I will encourage you, and will myself"
10569,ARGUMENT,Be active in his death; but if the Gods
10570,ARGUMENT,"Forbid it, then, by my advice, forbear."
10571,ARGUMENT,"So spake Amphinomus, whom all approved."
10572,ARGUMENT,"Arising then, into Ulysses' house                                480"
10573,ARGUMENT,"They went, where each his splendid seat resumed."
10574,ARGUMENT,"A novel purpose occupied, meantime,"
10575,ARGUMENT,Penelope; she purposed to appear
10576,ARGUMENT,"Before her suitors, whose design to slay"
10577,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus she had from Medon learn'd,"
10578,ARGUMENT,"The herald, for his ear had caught the sound."
10579,ARGUMENT,Toward the hall with her attendant train
10580,ARGUMENT,"She moved, and when, most graceful of her sex,"
10581,ARGUMENT,"Where sat the suitors she arrived, between"
10582,ARGUMENT,"The columns standing of the stately dome,                        490"
10583,ARGUMENT,And covering with her white veil's lucid folds
10584,ARGUMENT,"Her features, to Antinoüs thus she spake."
10585,ARGUMENT,"Antinoüs, proud, contentious, evermore"
10586,ARGUMENT,To mischief prone! the people deem thee wise
10587,ARGUMENT,"Past thy compeers, and in all grace of speech"
10588,ARGUMENT,"Pre-eminent, but such wast never thou."
10589,ARGUMENT,Inhuman! why is it thy dark design
10590,ARGUMENT,To slay Telemachus? and why with scorn
10591,ARGUMENT,"Rejectest thou the suppliant's pray'r,[72] which Jove"
10592,ARGUMENT,Himself hath witness'd? Plots please not the Gods.               500
10593,ARGUMENT,Know'st not that thy own father refuge found
10594,ARGUMENT,"Here, when he fled before the people's wrath"
10595,ARGUMENT,Whom he had irritated by a wrong
10596,ARGUMENT,"Which, with a band of Taphian robbers joined,"
10597,ARGUMENT,"He offer'd to the Thesprots, our allies?"
10598,ARGUMENT,"They would have torn his heart, and would have laid"
10599,ARGUMENT,"All his delights and his possessions waste,"
10600,ARGUMENT,But my Ulysses slaked the furious heat
10601,ARGUMENT,"Of their revenge, whom thou requitest now"
10602,ARGUMENT,"Wasting his goods, soliciting his wife,                          510"
10603,ARGUMENT,"Slaying his son, and filling me with woe."
10604,ARGUMENT,"But cease, I charge thee, and bid cease the rest."
10605,ARGUMENT,"To whom the son of Polybus replied,"
10606,ARGUMENT,Eurymachus.--Icarius' daughter wise!
10607,ARGUMENT,"Take courage, fair Penelope, and chace"
10608,ARGUMENT,These fears unreasonable from thy mind!
10609,ARGUMENT,"The man lives not, nor shall, who while I live,"
10610,ARGUMENT,"And faculty of sight retain, shall harm"
10611,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, thy son. For thus I say,"
10612,ARGUMENT,And thus will I perform; his blood shall stream                  520
10613,ARGUMENT,A sable current from my lance's point
10614,ARGUMENT,That moment; for the city-waster Chief
10615,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, oft, me placing on his knees,"
10616,ARGUMENT,"Hath fill'd my infant grasp with sav'ry food,"
10617,ARGUMENT,"And giv'n me ruddy wine. I, therefore, hold"
10618,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus of all men most my friend,"
10619,ARGUMENT,Nor hath he death to fear from hand of ours.
10620,ARGUMENT,"Yet, if the Gods shall doom him, die he must."
10621,ARGUMENT,"So he encouraged her, who yet, himself,"
10622,ARGUMENT,"Plotted his death. She, re-ascending, sought                     530"
10623,ARGUMENT,"Her stately chamber, and, arriving there,"
10624,ARGUMENT,Deplored with tears her long-regretted Lord
10625,ARGUMENT,Till Athenæan Pallas azure-eyed
10626,ARGUMENT,Dews of soft slumber o'er her lids diffused.
10627,ARGUMENT,"And now, at even-tide, Eumæus reach'd"
10628,ARGUMENT,Ulysses and his son. A yearling swine
10629,ARGUMENT,"Just slain they skilfully for food prepared,"
10630,ARGUMENT,"When Pallas, drawing nigh, smote with her wand"
10631,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, at the stroke rend'ring him old,"
10632,ARGUMENT,"And his apparel sordid as before,                                540"
10633,ARGUMENT,"Lest, knowing him, the swain at once should seek"
10634,ARGUMENT,"Penelope, and let the secret forth."
10635,ARGUMENT,Then foremost him Telemachus address'd.
10636,ARGUMENT,Noble Eumæus! thou art come; what news
10637,ARGUMENT,Bring'st from the city? Have the warrior band
10638,ARGUMENT,"Of suitors, hopeless of their ambush, reach'd"
10639,ARGUMENT,"The port again, or wait they still for me?"
10640,ARGUMENT,"To whom Eumæus, thou didst thus reply."
10641,ARGUMENT,"No time for such enquiry, nor to range,"
10642,ARGUMENT,"Curious, the streets had I, but anxious wish'd                   550"
10643,ARGUMENT,"To make my message known, and to return."
10644,ARGUMENT,"But, as it chanced, a nimble herald sent"
10645,ARGUMENT,"From thy companions, met me on the way,"
10646,ARGUMENT,"Who reach'd thy mother first. Yet this I know,"
10647,ARGUMENT,For this I saw. Passing above the town
10648,ARGUMENT,Where they have piled a way-side hill of stones
10649,ARGUMENT,"To Mercury, I beheld a gallant bark"
10650,ARGUMENT,"Ent'ring the port; a bark she was of ours,"
10651,ARGUMENT,"The crew were num'rous, and I mark'd her deep-"
10652,ARGUMENT,Laden with shields and spears of double edge.                    560
10653,ARGUMENT,"Theirs I conjectured her, and could no more."
10654,ARGUMENT,"He spake, and by Eumæus unperceived,"
10655,ARGUMENT,Telemachus his father eyed and smiled.
10656,ARGUMENT,"Their task accomplish'd, and the table spread,"
10657,ARGUMENT,"They ate, nor any his due portion miss'd,"
10658,ARGUMENT,"And hunger, now, and thirst both sated, all"
10659,ARGUMENT,"To rest repair'd, and took the gift of sleep."

10676,ARGUMENT,"and enters among the suitors, having been known only by his old dog"
10677,ARGUMENT,"Argus, who dies at his feet. The curiosity of Penelope being excited by"
10678,ARGUMENT,"the account which Eumæus gives her of Ulysses, she orders him immediately"

10680,ARGUMENT,"the suitors having left the palace, there shall be no danger of"

10697,ARGUMENT,"From such as may, perchance, vouchsafe the boon."
10698,ARGUMENT,"I cannot, vext and harass'd as I am,"

10700,ARGUMENT,The worse for him. Plain truth is my delight.
10701,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
10702,ARGUMENT,Nor is it my desire to be detained.

10714,ARGUMENT,"Of morning would benumb me thus attired,"
10715,ARGUMENT,"And, as ye say, the city is remote."
10716,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and Telemachus in haste"
10717,ARGUMENT,"Set forth, his thoughts all teeming as he went"
10718,ARGUMENT,With dire revenge. Soon in the palace-courts
10719,ARGUMENT,"Arriving, he reclined his spear against"
10720,ARGUMENT,"A column, and proceeded to the hall."
10721,ARGUMENT,"Him Euryclea, first, his nurse, perceived,"
10722,ARGUMENT,While on the variegated seats she spread
10723,ARGUMENT,Their fleecy cov'ring; swift with tearful eyes                    40
10724,ARGUMENT,"She flew to him, and the whole female train"
10725,ARGUMENT,"Of brave Ulysses swarm'd around his son,"
10726,ARGUMENT,"Clasping him, and his forehead and his neck"
10727,ARGUMENT,"Kissing affectionate; then came, herself,"
10728,ARGUMENT,"As golden Venus or Diana fair,"
10729,ARGUMENT,"Forth from her chamber to her son's embrace,"
10730,ARGUMENT,The chaste Penelope; with tears she threw
10731,ARGUMENT,"Her arms around him, his bright-beaming eyes"
10732,ARGUMENT,"And forehead kiss'd, and with a murmur'd plaint"
10733,ARGUMENT,"Maternal, in wing'd accents thus began.                           50"
10734,ARGUMENT,"Thou hast return'd, light of my eyes! my son!"
10735,ARGUMENT,My lov'd Telemachus! I had no hope
10736,ARGUMENT,To see thee more when once thou hadst embark'd
10737,ARGUMENT,"For Pylus, privily, and with no consent"
10738,ARGUMENT,"From me obtain'd, news seeking of thy sire."
10739,ARGUMENT,But haste; unfold. Declare what thou hast seen.
10740,ARGUMENT,"To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied."
10741,ARGUMENT,"Ah mother! let my sorrows rest, nor me"
10742,ARGUMENT,"From death so lately 'scaped afflict anew,"
10743,ARGUMENT,"But, bathed and habited in fresh attire,                          60"
10744,ARGUMENT,With all the maidens of thy train ascend
10745,ARGUMENT,"To thy superior chamber, there to vow"
10746,ARGUMENT,"A perfect hecatomb to all the Gods,"
10747,ARGUMENT,When Jove shall have avenged our num'rous wrongs.
10748,ARGUMENT,"I seek the forum, there to introduce"
10749,ARGUMENT,"A guest, my follower from the Pylian shore,"
10750,ARGUMENT,"Whom sending forward with my noble band,"
10751,ARGUMENT,I bade Piræus to his own abode
10752,ARGUMENT,"Lead him, and with all kindness entertain"
10753,ARGUMENT,"The stranger, till I should myself arrive.                        70"
10754,ARGUMENT,"He spake, nor flew his words useless away."
10755,ARGUMENT,"She, bathed and habited in fresh attire,"
10756,ARGUMENT,"Vow'd a full hecatomb to all the Gods,"
10757,ARGUMENT,Would Jove but recompense her num'rous wrongs.
10758,ARGUMENT,"Then, spear in hand, went forth her son, two dogs"
10759,ARGUMENT,Fleet-footed following him. O'er all his form
10760,ARGUMENT,"Pallas diffused a dignity divine,"
10761,ARGUMENT,And ev'ry eye gazed on him as he pass'd.
10762,ARGUMENT,"The suitors throng'd him round, joy on their lips"
10763,ARGUMENT,"And welcome, but deep mischief in their hearts.                   80"
10764,ARGUMENT,"He, shunning all that crowd, chose to himself"
10765,ARGUMENT,"A seat, where Mentor sat, and Antiphus,"
10766,ARGUMENT,"And Halytherses, long his father's friends"
10767,ARGUMENT,"Sincere, who of his voyage much enquired."
10768,ARGUMENT,"Then drew Piræus nigh, leading his guest"
10769,ARGUMENT,Toward the forum; nor Telemachus
10770,ARGUMENT,"Stood long aloof, but greeted his approach,"
10771,ARGUMENT,And was accosted by Piræus thus.
10772,ARGUMENT,Sir! send thy menial women to bring home
10773,ARGUMENT,"The precious charge committed to my care,                         90"
10774,ARGUMENT,Thy gifts at Menelaus' hands received.
10775,ARGUMENT,"To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied."
10776,ARGUMENT,Piræus! wait; for I not yet foresee
10777,ARGUMENT,The upshot. Should these haughty ones effect
10778,ARGUMENT,"My death, clandestine, under my own roof,"
10779,ARGUMENT,"And parcel my inheritance by lot,"
10780,ARGUMENT,"I rather wish those treasures thine, than theirs."
10781,ARGUMENT,But should I with success plan for them all
10782,ARGUMENT,"A bloody death, then, wing'd with joy, thyself"
10783,ARGUMENT,Bring home those presents to thy joyful friend.                  100
10784,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he led the anxious stranger thence"
10785,ARGUMENT,"Into the royal mansion, where arrived,"
10786,ARGUMENT,"Each cast his mantle on a couch or throne,"
10787,ARGUMENT,And plung'd his feet into a polish'd bath.
10788,ARGUMENT,"There wash'd and lubricated with smooth oils,"
10789,ARGUMENT,From the attendant maidens each received
10790,ARGUMENT,"Tunic and shaggy mantle. Thus attired,"
10791,ARGUMENT,"Forth from the baths they stepp'd, and sat again."
10792,ARGUMENT,"A maiden, next, with golden ewer charged,"
10793,ARGUMENT,"And silver bowl, pour'd water on their hands,                    110"
10794,ARGUMENT,"And spread the polish'd table, which with food"
10795,ARGUMENT,"Of all kinds, remnants of the last regale,"
10796,ARGUMENT,The mistress of the household charge supplied.
10797,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, beside a column of the dome"
10798,ARGUMENT,"His mother, on a couch reclining, twirl'd"
10799,ARGUMENT,Her slender threads. They to the furnish'd board
10800,ARGUMENT,"Stretch'd forth their hands, and, hunger now and thirst"
10801,ARGUMENT,"Both satisfied, Penelope began."
10802,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus! I will ascend again,"
10803,ARGUMENT,And will repose me on my woeful bed;                             120
10804,ARGUMENT,"For such it hath been, and with tears of mine"
10805,ARGUMENT,"Ceaseless bedew'd, e'er since Ulysses went"
10806,ARGUMENT,With Atreus' sons to Troy. For not a word
10807,ARGUMENT,Thou would'st vouchsafe me till our haughty guests
10808,ARGUMENT,"Had occupied the house again, of all"
10809,ARGUMENT,That thou hast heard (if aught indeed thou hast)
10810,ARGUMENT,Of thy long-absent father's wish'd return.
10811,ARGUMENT,Her answer'd then Telemachus discrete.
10812,ARGUMENT,"Mother, at thy request I will with truth"
10813,ARGUMENT,Relate the whole. At Pylus shore arrived                         130
10814,ARGUMENT,"We Nestor found, Chief of the Pylian race."
10815,ARGUMENT,"Receiving me in his august abode,"
10816,ARGUMENT,He entertain'd me with such welcome kind
10817,ARGUMENT,As a glad father shews to his own son
10818,ARGUMENT,"Long-lost and newly found; so Nestor me,"
10819,ARGUMENT,"And his illustrious offspring, entertain'd,"
10820,ARGUMENT,But yet assured me that he nought had heard
10821,ARGUMENT,"From mortal lips of my magnanimous sire,"
10822,ARGUMENT,Whether alive or dead; with his own steeds
10823,ARGUMENT,"He sent me, and with splendid chariot thence                     140"
10824,ARGUMENT,"To spear-famed Menelaus, Atreus' son."
10825,ARGUMENT,"There saw I Helen, by the Gods' decree"
10826,ARGUMENT,Auth'ress of trouble both to Greece and Troy.
10827,ARGUMENT,The Hero Menelaus then enquired
10828,ARGUMENT,What cause had urged me to the pleasant vale
10829,ARGUMENT,Of Lacedæmon; plainly I rehearsed
10830,ARGUMENT,"The occasion, and the Hero thus replied."
10831,ARGUMENT,Ye Gods! they are ambitious of the bed
10832,ARGUMENT,"Of a brave man, however base themselves."
10833,ARGUMENT,"But, as it chances when the hart hath laid                       150"
10834,ARGUMENT,"Her fawns new-yean'd and sucklings yet, to rest"
10835,ARGUMENT,"In some resistless lion's den, she roams,"
10836,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, the hills, and in the grassy vales"
10837,ARGUMENT,"Feeds heedless, but the lion to his lair"
10838,ARGUMENT,"Returning soon, both her and hers destroys,"
10839,ARGUMENT,"So shall thy father, brave Ulysses, them."
10840,ARGUMENT,Jove! Pallas! and Apollo! oh that such
10841,ARGUMENT,"As erst in well-built Lesbos, where he strove"
10842,ARGUMENT,"With Philomelides, whom wrestling, flat"
10843,ARGUMENT,"He threw, when all Achaia's sons rejoiced,                       160"
10844,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, now, might mingle with his foes!"
10845,ARGUMENT,"Short life and bitter nuptials should be theirs,"
10846,ARGUMENT,But thy enquiries neither indirect
10847,ARGUMENT,"Will I evade, nor give thee false reply,"
10848,ARGUMENT,But all that from the Ancient of the Deep[73]
10849,ARGUMENT,"I have received will utter, hiding nought."
10850,ARGUMENT,The God declared that he had seen thy sire
10851,ARGUMENT,"In a lone island, sorrowing, and detain'd"
10852,ARGUMENT,An inmate in the grotto of the nymph
10853,ARGUMENT,"Calypso, wanting also means by which                             170"
10854,ARGUMENT,"To reach the country of his birth again,"
10855,ARGUMENT,For neither gallant barks nor friends had he
10856,ARGUMENT,To speed his passage o'er the boundless waves.
10857,ARGUMENT,"So Menelaus spake, the spear-renown'd."
10858,ARGUMENT,"My errand thus accomplish'd, I return'd--"
10859,ARGUMENT,"And by the Gods with gales propitious blest,"
10860,ARGUMENT,Was wafted swiftly to my native shore.
10861,ARGUMENT,"He spake, and tumult in his mother's heart"
10862,ARGUMENT,"So speaking, raised. Consolatory, next,"
10863,ARGUMENT,The godlike Theoclymenus began.                                  180
10864,ARGUMENT,Consort revered of Laertiades!
10865,ARGUMENT,"Little the Spartan knew, but list to me,"
10866,ARGUMENT,For I will plainly prophesy and sure.
10867,ARGUMENT,"Be Jove of all in heav'n my witness first,"
10868,ARGUMENT,"Then this thy hospitable board, and, last,"
10869,ARGUMENT,The household Gods of the illustrious Chief
10870,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, at whose hearth I have arrived,[74]"
10871,ARGUMENT,"That, even now, within his native isle"
10872,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses somewhere sits, or creeps obscure,"
10873,ARGUMENT,"Witness of these enormities, and seeds                           190"
10874,ARGUMENT,Sowing of dire destruction for his foes;
10875,ARGUMENT,"So sure an augury, while on the deck"
10876,ARGUMENT,"Reclining of the gallant bark, I saw,"
10877,ARGUMENT,And with loud voice proclaim'd it to thy son.
10878,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then Penelope discrete.
10879,ARGUMENT,"Grant heav'n, my guest, that this good word of thine"
10880,ARGUMENT,Fail not! then shalt thou soon such bounty share
10881,ARGUMENT,"And friendship at my hands, that at first sight"
10882,ARGUMENT,Whoe'er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest.
10883,ARGUMENT,Thus they conferr'd. Meantime the suitors hurl'd               200
10884,ARGUMENT,The quoit and lance on the smooth area spread
10885,ARGUMENT,"Before Ulysses' gate, the custom'd scene"
10886,ARGUMENT,"Of their contentions, sports, and clamours rude."
10887,ARGUMENT,"But when the hour of supper now approach'd,"
10888,ARGUMENT,And from the pastures on all sides the sheep
10889,ARGUMENT,"Came with their wonted drivers, Medon then"
10890,ARGUMENT,"(For he of all the heralds pleas'd them most,"
10891,ARGUMENT,And waited at the board) them thus address'd.
10892,ARGUMENT,"Enough of play, young princes! ent'ring now"
10893,ARGUMENT,"The house, prepare we sedulous our feast,                        210"
10894,ARGUMENT,Since in well-timed refreshment harm is none.
10895,ARGUMENT,"He spake, whose admonition pleas'd. At once"
10896,ARGUMENT,"All, rising, sought the palace; there arrived,"
10897,ARGUMENT,"Each cast his mantle off, which on his throne"
10898,ARGUMENT,"Or couch he spread, then, brisk, to slaughter fell"
10899,ARGUMENT,Of many a victim; sheep and goats and brawns
10900,ARGUMENT,"They slew, all fatted, and a pastur'd ox,"
10901,ARGUMENT,Hast'ning the banquet; nor with less dispatch
10902,ARGUMENT,Ulysses and Eumæus now prepared
10903,ARGUMENT,"To seek the town, when thus the swain began.                     220"
10904,ARGUMENT,My guest! since thy fixt purpose is to seek
10905,ARGUMENT,"This day the city as my master bade,"
10906,ARGUMENT,"Though I, in truth, much rather wish thee here"
10907,ARGUMENT,"A keeper of our herds, yet, through respect"
10908,ARGUMENT,"And rev'rence of his orders, whose reproof"
10909,ARGUMENT,"I dread, for masters seldom gently chide,"
10910,ARGUMENT,"I would be gone. Arise, let us depart,"
10911,ARGUMENT,"For day already is far-spent, and soon"
10912,ARGUMENT,The air of even-tide will chill thee more.
10913,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.                           230"
10914,ARGUMENT,It is enough. I understand. Thou speak'st
10915,ARGUMENT,"To one intelligent. Let us depart,"
10916,ARGUMENT,"And lead, thyself, the way; but give me, first,"
10917,ARGUMENT,(If thou have one already hewn) a staff
10918,ARGUMENT,"To lean on, for ye have described the road"
10919,ARGUMENT,"Rugged, and ofttimes dang'rous to the foot."
10920,ARGUMENT,"So saying, his tatter'd wallet o'er his back"
10921,ARGUMENT,"He cast, suspended by a leathern twist,"
10922,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus gratified him with a staff,"
10923,ARGUMENT,"And forth they went, leaving the cottage kept                    240"
10924,ARGUMENT,By dogs and swains. He city-ward his King
10925,ARGUMENT,"Led on, in form a squalid beggar old,"
10926,ARGUMENT,"Halting, and in unseemly garb attired."
10927,ARGUMENT,"But when, slow-travelling the craggy way,"
10928,ARGUMENT,"They now approach'd the town, and had attain'd"
10929,ARGUMENT,"The marble fountain deep, which with its streams"
10930,ARGUMENT,"Pellucid all the citizens supplied,"
10931,ARGUMENT,(Ithacus had that fountain framed of old
10932,ARGUMENT,"With Neritus and Polyctor, over which"
10933,ARGUMENT,A grove of water-nourish'd alders hung                           250
10934,ARGUMENT,"Circular on all sides, while cold the rill"
10935,ARGUMENT,"Ran from the rock, on whose tall summit stood"
10936,ARGUMENT,"The altar of the nymphs, by all who pass'd"
10937,ARGUMENT,"With sacrifice frequented, still, and pray'r)"
10938,ARGUMENT,"Melantheus, son of Dolius, at that fount"
10939,ARGUMENT,"Met them; the chosen goats of ev'ry flock,"
10940,ARGUMENT,"With two assistants, from the field he drove,"
10941,ARGUMENT,"The suitors' supper. He, seeing them both,"
10942,ARGUMENT,"In surly accent boorish, such as fired"
10943,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses with resentment, thus began.                             260"
10944,ARGUMENT,Ay--this is well--The villain leads the vile--
10945,ARGUMENT,Thus evermore the Gods join like to like.
10946,ARGUMENT,"Thou clumsy swine-herd, whither would'st conduct"
10947,ARGUMENT,"This morsel-hunting mendicant obscene,"
10948,ARGUMENT,Defiler base of banquets? many a post
10949,ARGUMENT,Shall he rub smooth that props him while he begs
10950,ARGUMENT,"Lean alms, sole object of his low pursuit,"
10951,ARGUMENT,Who ne'er to sword or tripod yet aspired.
10952,ARGUMENT,Would'st thou afford him to me for a guard
10953,ARGUMENT,"Or sweeper of my stalls, or to supply                            270"
10954,ARGUMENT,"My kids with leaves, he should on bulkier thewes"
10955,ARGUMENT,"Supported stand, though nourish'd but with whey."
10956,ARGUMENT,"But no such useful arts hath he acquired,"
10957,ARGUMENT,"Nor likes he work, but rather much to extort"
10958,ARGUMENT,From others food for his unsated maw.
10959,ARGUMENT,"But mark my prophecy, for it is true,"
10960,ARGUMENT,"At famed Ulysses' house should he arrive,"
10961,ARGUMENT,His sides shall shatter many a footstool hurl'd
10962,ARGUMENT,Against them by the offended princes there.
10963,ARGUMENT,"He spake, and drawing nigh, with his rais'd foot,              280"
10964,ARGUMENT,"Insolent as he was and brutish, smote"
10965,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses' haunch, yet shook not from his path"
10966,ARGUMENT,"The firm-set Chief, who, doubtful, mused awhile"
10967,ARGUMENT,"Whether to rush on him, and with his staff"
10968,ARGUMENT,"To slay him, or uplifting him on high,"
10969,ARGUMENT,Downward to dash him headlong; but his wrath
10970,ARGUMENT,"Restraining, calm he suffer'd the affront."
10971,ARGUMENT,Him then Eumæus with indignant look
10972,ARGUMENT,"Rebuking, rais'd his hands, and fervent pray'd."
10973,ARGUMENT,"Nymphs of the fountains, progeny of Jove!                      290"
10974,ARGUMENT,If e'er Ulysses on your altar burn'd
10975,ARGUMENT,"The thighs of fatted lambs or kidlings, grant"
10976,ARGUMENT,"This my request. O let the Hero soon,"
10977,ARGUMENT,"Conducted by some Deity, return!"
10978,ARGUMENT,So shall he quell that arrogance which safe
10979,ARGUMENT,"Thou now indulgest, roaming day by day"
10980,ARGUMENT,"The city, while bad shepherds mar the flocks."
10981,ARGUMENT,To whom the goat-herd answer thus return'd
10982,ARGUMENT,Melantheus. Marvellous! how rare a speech
10983,ARGUMENT,The subtle cur hath framed! whom I will send                     300
10984,ARGUMENT,Far hence at a convenient time on board
10985,ARGUMENT,"My bark, and sell him at no little gain."
10986,ARGUMENT,"I would, that he who bears the silver bow"
10987,ARGUMENT,As sure might pierce Telemachus this day
10988,ARGUMENT,"In his own house, or that the suitors might,"
10989,ARGUMENT,As that same wand'rer shall return no more!
10990,ARGUMENT,"He said, and them left pacing slow along,"
10991,ARGUMENT,"But soon, himself, at his Lord's house arrived;"
10992,ARGUMENT,"There ent'ring bold, he with the suitors sat"
10993,ARGUMENT,"Opposite to Eurymachus, for him                                  310"
10994,ARGUMENT,He valued most. The sewers his portion placed
10995,ARGUMENT,"Of meat before him, and the maiden, chief"
10996,ARGUMENT,Directress of the household gave him bread.
10997,ARGUMENT,"And now, Ulysses, with the swain his friend"
10998,ARGUMENT,"Approach'd, when, hearing the harmonious lyre,"
10999,ARGUMENT,"Both stood, for Phemius had begun his song."
11000,ARGUMENT,"He grasp'd the swine-herd's hand, and thus he said."
11001,ARGUMENT,"This house, Eumæus! of Ulysses seems"
11002,ARGUMENT,"Passing magnificent, and to be known"
11003,ARGUMENT,With ease for his among a thousand more.                         320
11004,ARGUMENT,"One pile supports another, and a wall"
11005,ARGUMENT,Crested with battlements surrounds the court;
11006,ARGUMENT,"Firm, too, the folding doors all force of man"
11007,ARGUMENT,"Defy; but num'rous guests, as I perceive,"
11008,ARGUMENT,Now feast within; witness the sav'ry steam
11009,ARGUMENT,"Fast-fuming upward, and the sounding harp,"
11010,ARGUMENT,Divine associate of the festive board.
11011,ARGUMENT,"To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply."
11012,ARGUMENT,"Thou hast well-guess'd; no wonder, thou art quick"
11013,ARGUMENT,On ev'ry theme; but let us well forecast                         330
11014,ARGUMENT,"This business. Wilt thou, ent'ring first, thyself,"
11015,ARGUMENT,"The splendid mansion, with the suitors mix,"
11016,ARGUMENT,Me leaving here? or shall I lead the way
11017,ARGUMENT,"While thou remain'st behind? yet linger not,"
11018,ARGUMENT,"Lest, seeing thee without, some servant strike"
11019,ARGUMENT,Or drive thee hence. Consider which were best.
11020,ARGUMENT,"Him answer'd, then, the patient Hero bold."
11021,ARGUMENT,It is enough. I understand. Thou speak'st
11022,ARGUMENT,To one intelligent. Lead thou the way
11023,ARGUMENT,"Me leaving here, for neither stripes nor blows                   340"
11024,ARGUMENT,To me are strange. Much exercised with pain
11025,ARGUMENT,"In fight and on the Deep, I have long since"
11026,ARGUMENT,"Learn'd patience. Follow, next, what follow may!"
11027,ARGUMENT,"But, to suppress the appetite, I deem"
11028,ARGUMENT,Impossible; the stomach is a source
11029,ARGUMENT,"Of ills to man, an avaricious gulph"
11030,ARGUMENT,"Destructive, which to satiate, ships are rigg'd,"
11031,ARGUMENT,"Seas travers'd, and fierce battles waged remote."
11032,ARGUMENT,"Thus they discoursing stood; Argus the while,"
11033,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses' dog, uplifted where he lay                              350"
11034,ARGUMENT,His head and ears erect. Ulysses him
11035,ARGUMENT,"Had bred long since, himself, but rarely used,"
11036,ARGUMENT,"Departing, first, to Ilium. Him the youths"
11037,ARGUMENT,In other days led frequent to the chace
11038,ARGUMENT,"Of wild goat, hart and hare; but now he lodg'd"
11039,ARGUMENT,"A poor old cast-off, of his Lord forlorn,"
11040,ARGUMENT,Where mules and oxen had before the gate
11041,ARGUMENT,"Much ordure left, with which Ulysses' hinds"
11042,ARGUMENT,"Should, in due time, manure his spacious fields."
11043,ARGUMENT,"There lay, with dog-devouring vermin foul                        360"
11044,ARGUMENT,"All over, Argus; soon as he perceived"
11045,ARGUMENT,"Long-lost Ulysses nigh, down fell his ears"
11046,ARGUMENT,"Clapp'd close, and with his tail glad sign he gave"
11047,ARGUMENT,"Of gratulation, impotent to rise"
11048,ARGUMENT,And to approach his master as of old.
11049,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, noting him, wiped off a tear"
11050,ARGUMENT,"Unmark'd, and of Eumæus quick enquired."
11051,ARGUMENT,I can but wonder seeing such a dog
11052,ARGUMENT,"Thus lodg'd, Eumæus! beautiful in form"
11053,ARGUMENT,"He is, past doubt, but whether he hath been                      370"
11054,ARGUMENT,As fleet as fair I know not; rather such
11055,ARGUMENT,Perchance as masters sometimes keep to grace
11056,ARGUMENT,"Their tables, nourish'd more for shew than use."
11057,ARGUMENT,"To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply."
11058,ARGUMENT,He is the dog of one dead far remote.
11059,ARGUMENT,But had he now such feat-performing strength
11060,ARGUMENT,"As when Ulysses left him, going hence"
11061,ARGUMENT,"To Ilium, in one moment thou shouldst mark,"
11062,ARGUMENT,"Astonish'd, his agility and force."
11063,ARGUMENT,He never in the sylvan deep recess                               380
11064,ARGUMENT,"The wild beast saw that 'scaped him, and he track'd"
11065,ARGUMENT,Their steps infallible; but he hath now
11066,ARGUMENT,"No comfort, for (the master dead afar)"
11067,ARGUMENT,The heedless servants care not for his dog.
11068,ARGUMENT,"Domestics, missing once their Lord's controul,"
11069,ARGUMENT,"Grow wilful, and refuse their proper tasks;"
11070,ARGUMENT,"For whom Jove dooms to servitude, he takes"
11071,ARGUMENT,At once the half of that man's worth away.
11072,ARGUMENT,"He said, and, ent'ring at the portal, join'd"
11073,ARGUMENT,The suitors. Then his destiny released                           390
11074,ARGUMENT,"Old Argus, soon as he had lived to see"
11075,ARGUMENT,Ulysses in the twentieth year restored.
11076,ARGUMENT,"Godlike Telemachus, long ere the rest,"
11077,ARGUMENT,"Marking the swine-herd's entrance, with a nod"
11078,ARGUMENT,Summon'd him to approach. Eumæus cast
11079,ARGUMENT,"His eye around, and seeing vacant there"
11080,ARGUMENT,The seat which the dispenser of the feast
11081,ARGUMENT,Was wont to occupy while he supplied
11082,ARGUMENT,"The num'rous guests, planted it right before"
11083,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, and at his table sat,                                400"
11084,ARGUMENT,On which the herald placed for him his share
11085,ARGUMENT,"Of meat, and from the baskets gave him bread."
11086,ARGUMENT,"Soon after _him_, Ulysses enter'd slow"
11087,ARGUMENT,"The palace, like a squalid beggar old,"
11088,ARGUMENT,"Staff-propp'd, and in loose tatters foul attired."
11089,ARGUMENT,Within the portal on the ashen sill
11090,ARGUMENT,"He sat, and, seeming languid, lean'd against"
11091,ARGUMENT,A cypress pillar by the builder's art
11092,ARGUMENT,"Polish'd long since, and planted at the door."
11093,ARGUMENT,Then took Telemachus a loaf entire                               410
11094,ARGUMENT,"Forth from the elegant basket, and of flesh"
11095,ARGUMENT,"A portion large as his two hands contained,"
11096,ARGUMENT,"And, beck'ning close the swine-herd, charged him thus."
11097,ARGUMENT,These to the stranger; whom advise to ask
11098,ARGUMENT,Some dole from ev'ry suitor; bashful fear
11099,ARGUMENT,Ill suits the mendicant by want oppress'd.
11100,ARGUMENT,"He spake; Eumæus went, and where he sat"
11101,ARGUMENT,"Arriving, in wing'd accents thus began."
11102,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, oh stranger, sends thee these,"
11103,ARGUMENT,And counsels thee to importune for more                          420
11104,ARGUMENT,"The suitors, one by one; for bashful fear"
11105,ARGUMENT,Ill suits the mendicant by want oppress'd.
11106,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
11107,ARGUMENT,"Jove, King of all, grant ev'ry good on earth"
11108,ARGUMENT,"To kind Telemachus, and the complete"
11109,ARGUMENT,Accomplishment of all that he desires!
11110,ARGUMENT,"He said, and with both hands outspread, the mess"
11111,ARGUMENT,"Receiving as he sat, on his worn bag"
11112,ARGUMENT,Disposed it at his feet. Long as the bard
11113,ARGUMENT,"Chaunted, he ate, and when he ceas'd to eat,                     430"
11114,ARGUMENT,Then also ceas'd the bard divine to sing.
11115,ARGUMENT,And now ensued loud clamour in the hall
11116,ARGUMENT,"And tumult, when Minerva, drawing nigh"
11117,ARGUMENT,"To Laertiades, impell'd the Chief"
11118,ARGUMENT,"Crusts to collect, or any pittance small"
11119,ARGUMENT,"At ev'ry suitor's hand, for trial's sake"
11120,ARGUMENT,Of just and unjust; yet deliv'rance none
11121,ARGUMENT,From evil she design'd for any there.
11122,ARGUMENT,From left to right[75] his progress he began
11123,ARGUMENT,"Petitioning, with outstretch'd hands, the throng,                440"
11124,ARGUMENT,As one familiar with the beggar's art.
11125,ARGUMENT,"They, pitying, gave to him, but view'd him still"
11126,ARGUMENT,"With wonder, and enquiries mutual made"
11127,ARGUMENT,"Who, and whence was he? Then the goat-herd rose"
11128,ARGUMENT,"Melanthius, and th' assembly thus address'd."
11129,ARGUMENT,"Hear me, ye suitors of th' illustrious Queen!"
11130,ARGUMENT,"This guest, of whom ye ask, I have beheld"
11131,ARGUMENT,Elsewhere; the swine-herd brought him; but himself
11132,ARGUMENT,"I know not, neither who nor whence he is."
11133,ARGUMENT,So he; then thus Antinoüs stern rebuked                        450
11134,ARGUMENT,"The swine-herd. Ah, notorious as thou art,"
11135,ARGUMENT,Why hast thou shewn this vagabond the way
11136,ARGUMENT,Into the city? are we not enough
11137,ARGUMENT,Infested with these troublers of our feasts?
11138,ARGUMENT,Deem'st it a trifle that such numbers eat
11139,ARGUMENT,"At thy Lord's cost, and hast thou, therefore, led"
11140,ARGUMENT,"This fellow hither, found we know not where?"
11141,ARGUMENT,"To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply."
11142,ARGUMENT,"Antinoüs! though of high degree, thou speak'st"
11143,ARGUMENT,Not wisely. What man to another's house                          460
11144,ARGUMENT,"Repairs to invite him to a feast, unless"
11145,ARGUMENT,He be of those who by profession serve
11146,ARGUMENT,"The public, prophet, healer of disease,"
11147,ARGUMENT,"Ingenious artist, or some bard divine"
11148,ARGUMENT,Whose music may exhilarate the guests?
11149,ARGUMENT,"These, and such only, are in ev'ry land"
11150,ARGUMENT,"Call'd to the banquet; none invites the poor,"
11151,ARGUMENT,"Who much consume, and no requital yield."
11152,ARGUMENT,But thou of all the suitors roughly treat'st
11153,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses' servants most, and chiefly me;                          470"
11154,ARGUMENT,"Yet thee I heed not, while the virtuous Queen"
11155,ARGUMENT,"Dwells in this palace, and her godlike son."
11156,ARGUMENT,"To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied."
11157,ARGUMENT,Peace! answer not verbose a man like him.
11158,ARGUMENT,Antinoüs hath a tongue accustom'd much
11159,ARGUMENT,"To tauntings, and promotes them in the rest."
11160,ARGUMENT,"Then, turning to Antinoüs, quick he said--"
11161,ARGUMENT,Antinoüs! as a father for his son
11162,ARGUMENT,"Takes thought, so thou for me, who bidd'st me chase"
11163,ARGUMENT,The stranger harshly hence; but God forbid![76]                  480
11164,ARGUMENT,"Impart to him. I grudge not, but myself"
11165,ARGUMENT,"Exhort thee to it; neither, in this cause,"
11166,ARGUMENT,"Fear thou the Queen, or in the least regard"
11167,ARGUMENT,Whatever menial throughout all the house
11168,ARGUMENT,Of famed Ulysses. Ah! within thy breast
11169,ARGUMENT,Dwells no such thought; thou lov'st not to impart
11170,ARGUMENT,"To others, but to gratify thyself."
11171,ARGUMENT,To whom Antinoüs answer thus return'd.
11172,ARGUMENT,High-soaring and intemp'rate in thy speech
11173,ARGUMENT,"How hast thou said, Telemachus? Would all                        490"
11174,ARGUMENT,"As much bestow on him, he should not seek"
11175,ARGUMENT,Admittance here again three months to come.
11176,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he seized the stool which, banqueting,"
11177,ARGUMENT,"He press'd with his nice feet, and from beneath"
11178,ARGUMENT,The table forth advanced it into view.
11179,ARGUMENT,"The rest all gave to him, with bread and flesh"
11180,ARGUMENT,"Filling his wallet, and Ulysses, now,"
11181,ARGUMENT,"Returning to his threshold, there to taste"
11182,ARGUMENT,"The bounty of the Greeks, paused in his way"
11183,ARGUMENT,"Beside Antinoüs, whom he thus address'd.                         500"
11184,ARGUMENT,Kind sir! vouchsafe to me! for thou appear'st
11185,ARGUMENT,"Not least, but greatest of the Achaians here,"
11186,ARGUMENT,And hast a kingly look. It might become
11187,ARGUMENT,"Thee therefore above others to bestow,"
11188,ARGUMENT,So should I praise thee wheresoe'er I roam.
11189,ARGUMENT,I also lived the happy owner once
11190,ARGUMENT,"Of such a stately mansion, and have giv'n"
11191,ARGUMENT,To num'rous wand'rers (whencesoe'er they came)
11192,ARGUMENT,All that they needed; I was also served
11193,ARGUMENT,"By many, and enjoy'd all that denotes                            510"
11194,ARGUMENT,The envied owner opulent and blest.
11195,ARGUMENT,But Jove (for so it pleas'd him) hath reduced
11196,ARGUMENT,"My all to nothing, prompting me, in league"
11197,ARGUMENT,"With rovers of the Deep, to sail afar"
11198,ARGUMENT,"To Ægypt, for my sure destruction there."
11199,ARGUMENT,Within th' Ægyptian stream my barks well-oar'd
11200,ARGUMENT,"I station'd, and, enjoining strict my friends"
11201,ARGUMENT,"To watch them close-attendant at their side,"
11202,ARGUMENT,"Commanded spies into the hill-tops; but they,"
11203,ARGUMENT,Under the impulse of a spirit rash                               520
11204,ARGUMENT,"And hot for quarrel, the well-cultur'd fields"
11205,ARGUMENT,"Pillaged of the Ægyptians, captive led"
11206,ARGUMENT,"Their wives and little-ones, and slew the men."
11207,ARGUMENT,"Ere long, the loud alarm their city reach'd."
11208,ARGUMENT,"Down came the citizens, by dawn of day,"
11209,ARGUMENT,With horse and foot and with the gleam of arms
11210,ARGUMENT,Filling the plain. Then Jove with panic dread
11211,ARGUMENT,Struck all my people; none found courage more
11212,ARGUMENT,"To stand, for mischiefs swarm'd on ev'ry side."
11213,ARGUMENT,"There, num'rous by the glitt'ring spear we fell                  530"
11214,ARGUMENT,"Slaughter'd, while others they conducted thence"
11215,ARGUMENT,Alive to servitude; but me they gave
11216,ARGUMENT,"To Dmetor, King in Cyprus, Jasus' son;"
11217,ARGUMENT,"He entertained me liberally, and thence"
11218,ARGUMENT,"This land I reach'd, but poor and woe-begone."
11219,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus Antinoüs harsh return'd.
11220,ARGUMENT,"What dæmon introduced this nuisance here,"
11221,ARGUMENT,"This troubler of our feast? stand yonder, keep"
11222,ARGUMENT,"Due distance from my table, or expect"
11223,ARGUMENT,To see an Ægypt and a Cyprus worse                               540
11224,ARGUMENT,"Than those, bold mendicant and void of shame!"
11225,ARGUMENT,"Thou hauntest each, and, inconsid'rate, each"
11226,ARGUMENT,"Gives to thee, because gifts at other's cost"
11227,ARGUMENT,"Are cheap, and, plentifully serv'd themselves,"
11228,ARGUMENT,"They squander, heedless, viands not their own."
11229,ARGUMENT,To whom Ulysses while he slow retired.
11230,ARGUMENT,Gods! how illib'ral with that specious form!
11231,ARGUMENT,Thou wouldst not grant the poor a grain of salt
11232,ARGUMENT,"From thy own board, who at another's fed"
11233,ARGUMENT,"So nobly, canst thou not spare a crust to me.                    550"
11234,ARGUMENT,"He spake; then raged Antinoüs still the more,"
11235,ARGUMENT,"And in wing'd accents, louring, thus replied."
11236,ARGUMENT,"Take such dismission now as thou deserv'st,"
11237,ARGUMENT,Opprobrious! hast thou dared to scoff at me?
11238,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he seized his stool, and on the joint"
11239,ARGUMENT,Of his right shoulder smote him; firm as rock
11240,ARGUMENT,"He stood, by no such force to be displaced,"
11241,ARGUMENT,"But silent shook his brows, and dreadful deeds"
11242,ARGUMENT,"Of vengeance ruminating, sought again"
11243,ARGUMENT,"His seat the threshold, where his bag full-charged               560"
11244,ARGUMENT,"He grounded, and the suitors thus address'd."
11245,ARGUMENT,"Hear now, ye suitors of the matchless Queen,"
11246,ARGUMENT,"My bosom's dictates. Trivial is the harm,"
11247,ARGUMENT,"Scarce felt, if, fighting for his own, his sheep"
11248,ARGUMENT,"Perchance, or beeves, a man receive a blow."
11249,ARGUMENT,But me Antinoüs struck for that I ask'd
11250,ARGUMENT,Food from him merely to appease the pangs
11251,ARGUMENT,"Of hunger, source of num'rous ills to man."
11252,ARGUMENT,If then the poor man have a God t' avenge
11253,ARGUMENT,"His wrongs, I pray to him that death may seize                   570"
11254,ARGUMENT,"Antinoüs, ere his nuptial hour arrive!"
11255,ARGUMENT,"To whom Antinoüs answer thus return'd,"
11256,ARGUMENT,Son of Eupithes. Either seated there
11257,ARGUMENT,"Or going hence, eat, stranger, and be still;"
11258,ARGUMENT,"Lest for thy insolence, by hand or foot"
11259,ARGUMENT,"We drag thee forth, and thou be flay'd alive."
11260,ARGUMENT,"He ceased, whom all indignant heard, and thus"
11261,ARGUMENT,Ev'n his own proud companions censured him.
11262,ARGUMENT,Antinoüs! thou didst not well to smite
11263,ARGUMENT,The wretched vagabond. O thou art doom'd                         580
11264,ARGUMENT,"For ever, if there be a God in heav'n;[77]"
11265,ARGUMENT,"For, in similitude of strangers oft,"
11266,ARGUMENT,"The Gods, who can with ease all shapes assume,"
11267,ARGUMENT,"Repair to populous cities, where they mark"
11268,ARGUMENT,The outrageous and the righteous deeds of men.
11269,ARGUMENT,"So they, for whose reproof he little cared."
11270,ARGUMENT,But in his heart Telemachus that blow
11271,ARGUMENT,"Resented, anguish-torn, yet not a tear"
11272,ARGUMENT,"He shed, but silent shook his brows, and mused"
11273,ARGUMENT,"Terrible things. Penelope, meantime,                             590"
11274,ARGUMENT,Told of the wand'rer so abused beneath
11275,ARGUMENT,"Her roof, among her maidens thus exclaim'd."
11276,ARGUMENT,"So may Apollo, glorious archer, smite"
11277,ARGUMENT,"Thee also. Then Eurynome replied,"
11278,ARGUMENT,"Oh might our pray'rs prevail, none of them all"
11279,ARGUMENT,Should see bright-charioted Aurora more.
11280,ARGUMENT,Her answer'd then Penelope discrete.
11281,ARGUMENT,"Nurse! they are odious all, for that alike"
11282,ARGUMENT,All teem with mischief; but Antinoüs' looks
11283,ARGUMENT,Remind me ever of the gloom of death.                            600
11284,ARGUMENT,"A stranger hath arrived who, begging, roams"
11285,ARGUMENT,"The house, (for so his penury enjoins)"
11286,ARGUMENT,"The rest have giv'n him, and have fill'd his bag"
11287,ARGUMENT,"With viands, but Antinoüs hath bruised"
11288,ARGUMENT,His shoulder with a foot-stool hurl'd at him.
11289,ARGUMENT,While thus the Queen conversing with her train
11290,ARGUMENT,"In her own chamber sat, Ulysses made"
11291,ARGUMENT,"Plenteous repast. Then, calling to her side"
11292,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus, thus she signified her will."
11293,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus, noble friend! bid now approach                         610"
11294,ARGUMENT,"Yon stranger. I would speak with him, and ask"
11295,ARGUMENT,"If he has seen Ulysses, or have heard"
11296,ARGUMENT,"Tidings, perchance, of the afflicted Chief,"
11297,ARGUMENT,For much a wand'rer by his garb he seems.
11298,ARGUMENT,"To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply."
11299,ARGUMENT,"Were those Achaians silent, thou shouldst hear,"
11300,ARGUMENT,O Queen! a tale that would console thy heart.
11301,ARGUMENT,"Three nights I housed him, and within my cot"
11302,ARGUMENT,"Three days detain'd him, (for his ship he left"
11303,ARGUMENT,"A fugitive, and came direct to me)                               620"
11304,ARGUMENT,But half untold his hist'ry still remains.
11305,ARGUMENT,As when his eye one fixes on a bard
11306,ARGUMENT,From heav'n instructed in such themes as charm
11307,ARGUMENT,"The ear of mortals, ever as he sings"
11308,ARGUMENT,"The people press, insatiable, to hear,"
11309,ARGUMENT,"So, in my cottage, seated at my side,"
11310,ARGUMENT,That stranger with his tale enchanted me.
11311,ARGUMENT,"Laertes, he affirms, hath been his guest"
11312,ARGUMENT,"Erewhile in Crete, where Minos' race resides,"
11313,ARGUMENT,"And thence he hath arrived, after great loss,                    630"
11314,ARGUMENT,A suppliant to the very earth abased;
11315,ARGUMENT,"He adds, that in Thesprotia's neighbour realm"
11316,ARGUMENT,"He of Ulysses heard, both that he lives,"
11317,ARGUMENT,And that he comes laden with riches home.
11318,ARGUMENT,"To whom Penelope, discrete, replied."
11319,ARGUMENT,"Haste; call him. I would hear, myself, his tale."
11320,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, let these, or in the palace gate"
11321,ARGUMENT,"Sport jocular, or here; their hearts are light,"
11322,ARGUMENT,For their possessions are secure; _their_ wine
11323,ARGUMENT,"None drinks, or eats _their_ viands, save their own,             640"
11324,ARGUMENT,"While my abode, day after day, themselves"
11325,ARGUMENT,"Haunting, my beeves and sheep and fatted goats"
11326,ARGUMENT,"Slay for the banquet, and my casks exhaust"
11327,ARGUMENT,"Extravagant, whence endless waste ensues;"
11328,ARGUMENT,For no such friend as was Ulysses once
11329,ARGUMENT,Have I to expel the mischief. But might he
11330,ARGUMENT,"Revisit once his native shores again,"
11331,ARGUMENT,"Then, aided by his son, he should avenge,"
11332,ARGUMENT,"Incontinent, the wrongs which now I mourn."
11333,ARGUMENT,"Then sneezed Telemachus with sudden force,                     650"
11334,ARGUMENT,"That all the palace rang; his mother laugh'd,"
11335,ARGUMENT,And in wing'd accents thus the swain bespake.
11336,ARGUMENT,Haste--bid him hither--hear'st thou not the sneeze
11337,ARGUMENT,Propitious of my son? oh might it prove
11338,ARGUMENT,A presage of inevitable death
11339,ARGUMENT,To all these revellers! may none escape!
11340,ARGUMENT,Now mark me well. Should the event his tale
11341,ARGUMENT,"Confirm, at my own hands he shall receive"
11342,ARGUMENT,Mantle and tunic both for his reward.
11343,ARGUMENT,"She spake; he went, and where Ulysses sat                      660"
11344,ARGUMENT,"Arriving, in wing'd accents thus began."
11345,ARGUMENT,"Penelope, my venerable friend!"
11346,ARGUMENT,"Calls thee, the mother of Telemachus."
11347,ARGUMENT,"Oppress'd by num'rous troubles, she desires"
11348,ARGUMENT,To ask thee tidings of her absent Lord.
11349,ARGUMENT,"And should the event verify thy report,"
11350,ARGUMENT,Thy meed shall be (a boon which much thou need'st)
11351,ARGUMENT,Tunic and mantle; but she gives no more;
11352,ARGUMENT,"Thy sustenance thou must, as now, obtain,[78]"
11353,ARGUMENT,Begging it at their hands who chuse to give.                     670
11354,ARGUMENT,"Then thus Ulysses, Hero toil-inured."
11355,ARGUMENT,Eumæus! readily I can relate
11356,ARGUMENT,"Truth, and truth only, to the prudent Queen"
11357,ARGUMENT,Icarius' daughter; for of him I know
11358,ARGUMENT,"Much, and have suff'red sorrows like his own."
11359,ARGUMENT,But dread I feel of this imperious throng
11360,ARGUMENT,"Perverse, whose riot and outrageous acts"
11361,ARGUMENT,Of violence echo through the vault of heav'n.
11362,ARGUMENT,"And, even now, when for no fault of mine"
11363,ARGUMENT,"Yon suitor struck me as I pass'd, and fill'd                     680"
11364,ARGUMENT,"My flesh with pain, neither Telemachus"
11365,ARGUMENT,Nor any interposed to stay his arm.
11366,ARGUMENT,"Now, therefore, let Penelope, although"
11367,ARGUMENT,"Impatient, till the sun descend postpone"
11368,ARGUMENT,Her questions; then she may enquire secure
11369,ARGUMENT,"When comes her husband, and may nearer place"
11370,ARGUMENT,"My seat to the hearth-side, for thinly clad"
11371,ARGUMENT,"Thou know'st I am, whose aid I first implored."
11372,ARGUMENT,He ceas'd; at whose reply Eumæus sought
11373,ARGUMENT,"Again the Queen, but ere he yet had pass'd                       690"
11374,ARGUMENT,"The threshold, thus she greeted his return."
11375,ARGUMENT,"Com'st thou alone, Eumæus? why delays"
11376,ARGUMENT,The invited wand'rer? dreads he other harm?
11377,ARGUMENT,Or sees he aught that with a bashful awe
11378,ARGUMENT,Fills him? the bashful poor are poor indeed.
11379,ARGUMENT,"To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply."
11380,ARGUMENT,He hath well spoken; none who would decline
11381,ARGUMENT,The rudeness of this contumelious throng
11382,ARGUMENT,Could answer otherwise; thee he entreats
11383,ARGUMENT,"To wait till sun-set, and that course, O Queen,                  700"
11384,ARGUMENT,"Thou shalt thyself far more commodious find,"
11385,ARGUMENT,"To hold thy conf'rence with the guest, alone."
11386,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus Penelope return'd.
11387,ARGUMENT,"The stranger, I perceive, is not unwise,"
11388,ARGUMENT,"Whoe'er he be, for on the earth are none"
11389,ARGUMENT,"Proud, insolent, and profligate as these."
11390,ARGUMENT,So spake the Queen. Then (all his message told)
11391,ARGUMENT,The good Eumæus to the suitors went
11392,ARGUMENT,"Again, and with his head inclined toward"
11393,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, lest others should his words                         710"
11394,ARGUMENT,"Witness, in accents wing'd him thus address'd."
11395,ARGUMENT,Friend and kind master! I return to keep
11396,ARGUMENT,"My herds, and to attend my rural charge,"
11397,ARGUMENT,"Whence we are both sustain'd. Keep thou, meantime,"
11398,ARGUMENT,"All here with vigilance, but chiefly watch"
11399,ARGUMENT,"For thy own good, and save _thyself_ from harm;"
11400,ARGUMENT,"For num'rous here brood mischief, whom the Gods"
11401,ARGUMENT,"Exterminate, ere yet their plots prevail!"
11402,ARGUMENT,"To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied."
11403,ARGUMENT,"So be it, father! and (thy evening-mess                          720"
11404,ARGUMENT,"Eaten) depart; to-morrow come again,"
11405,ARGUMENT,"Bringing fair victims hither; I will keep,"
11406,ARGUMENT,"I and the Gods, meantime, all here secure."
11407,ARGUMENT,He ended; then resumed once more the swain
11408,ARGUMENT,"His polish'd seat, and, both with wine and food"
11409,ARGUMENT,"Now satiate, to his charge return'd, the court"
11410,ARGUMENT,Leaving and all the palace throng'd with guests;
11411,ARGUMENT,They (for it now was evening) all alike
11412,ARGUMENT,Turn'd jovial to the song and to the dance.

11445,ARGUMENT,
11446,ARGUMENT,The beggar Irus arrives at the palace; a combat takes place between him
11447,ARGUMENT,"and Ulysses, in which Irus is by one blow vanquished. Penelope appears to"
11448,ARGUMENT,"the suitors, and having reminded them of the presents which she had a"
11449,ARGUMENT,"right to expect from them, receives a gift from each. Eurymachus,"
11450,ARGUMENT,"provoked by a speech of Ulysses, flings a foot-stool at him, which knocks"
11451,ARGUMENT,"down the cup-bearer; a general tumult is the consequence, which"
11452,ARGUMENT,"continues, till by the advice of Telemachus, seconded by Amphinomus, the"
11453,ARGUMENT,suitors retire to their respective homes.
11454,ARGUMENT,
11455,ARGUMENT,
11456,ARGUMENT,"Now came a public mendicant, a man"
11457,ARGUMENT,"Accustom'd, seeking alms, to roam the streets"
11458,ARGUMENT,Of Ithaca; one never sated yet
11459,ARGUMENT,"With food or drink; yet muscle had he none,"
11460,ARGUMENT,"Or strength of limb, though giant-built in show."
11461,ARGUMENT,Arnæus was the name which at his birth
11462,ARGUMENT,"His mother gave him, but the youthful band"
11463,ARGUMENT,"Of suitors, whom as messenger he served,"
11464,ARGUMENT,"All named him Irus. He, arriving, sought"
11465,ARGUMENT,"To drive Ulysses forth from his own home,                         10"
11466,ARGUMENT,And in rough accents rude him thus rebuked.
11467,ARGUMENT,"Forth from the porch, old man! lest by the foot"
11468,ARGUMENT,I drag thee quickly forth. Seest not how all
11469,ARGUMENT,"Wink on me, and by signs give me command"
11470,ARGUMENT,To drag thee hence? nor is it aught but shame
11471,ARGUMENT,"That checks me. Yet arise, lest soon with fists"
11472,ARGUMENT,Thou force me to adjust our diff'rence.
11473,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, low'ring dark, replied."
11474,ARGUMENT,"Peace, fellow! neither word nor deed of mine"
11475,ARGUMENT,"Wrongs thee, nor feel I envy at the boon,                         20"
11476,ARGUMENT,"However plentiful, which thou receiv'st."
11477,ARGUMENT,The sill may hold us both; thou dost not well
11478,ARGUMENT,To envy others; thou appear'st like me
11479,ARGUMENT,A vagrant; plenty is the gift of heav'n.
11480,ARGUMENT,"But urge me not to trial of our fists,"
11481,ARGUMENT,"Lest thou provoke me, and I stain with blood"
11482,ARGUMENT,"Thy bosom and thy lips, old as I am."
11483,ARGUMENT,"So, my attendance should to-morrow prove"
11484,ARGUMENT,"More tranquil here; for thou should'st leave, I judge,"
11485,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses' mansion, never to return.                                30"
11486,ARGUMENT,"Then answer'd Irus, kindling with disdain."
11487,ARGUMENT,Gods! with what volubility of speech
11488,ARGUMENT,"The table-hunter prates, like an old hag"
11489,ARGUMENT,Collied with chimney-smutch! but ah beware!
11490,ARGUMENT,"For I intend thee mischief, and to dash"
11491,ARGUMENT,"With both hands ev'ry grinder from thy gums,"
11492,ARGUMENT,As men untooth a pig pilf'ring the corn.
11493,ARGUMENT,"Come--gird thee, that all here may view the strife--"
11494,ARGUMENT,But how wilt thou oppose one young as I?
11495,ARGUMENT,Thus on the threshold of the lofty gate                         40
11496,ARGUMENT,"They, wrangling, chafed each other, whose dispute"
11497,ARGUMENT,The high-born youth Antinoüs mark'd; he laugh'd
11498,ARGUMENT,"Delighted, and the suitors thus address'd."
11499,ARGUMENT,Oh friends! no pastime ever yet occurr'd
11500,ARGUMENT,"Pleasant as this which, now, the Gods themselves"
11501,ARGUMENT,Afford us. Irus and the stranger brawl
11502,ARGUMENT,As they would box. Haste--let us urge them on.
11503,ARGUMENT,He said; at once loud-laughing all arose;
11504,ARGUMENT,The ill-clad disputants they round about
11505,ARGUMENT,"Encompass'd, and Antinoüs thus began.                             50"
11506,ARGUMENT,Attend ye noble suitors to my voice.
11507,ARGUMENT,"Two paunches lie of goats here on the fire,"
11508,ARGUMENT,Which fill'd with fat and blood we set apart
11509,ARGUMENT,"For supper; he who conquers, and in force"
11510,ARGUMENT,"Superior proves, shall freely take the paunch"
11511,ARGUMENT,"Which he prefers, and shall with us thenceforth"
11512,ARGUMENT,Feast always; neither will we here admit
11513,ARGUMENT,Poor man beside to beg at our repasts.
11514,ARGUMENT,"He spake, whom all approved; next, artful Chief"
11515,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses thus, dissembling, them address'd.                        60"
11516,ARGUMENT,Princes! unequal is the strife between
11517,ARGUMENT,A young man and an old with mis'ry worn;
11518,ARGUMENT,"But hunger, always counsellor of ill,"
11519,ARGUMENT,"Me moves to fight, that many a bruise received,"
11520,ARGUMENT,I may be foil'd at last. Now swear ye all
11521,ARGUMENT,"A solemn oath, that none, for Irus' sake"
11522,ARGUMENT,"Shall, interposing, smite me with his fist"
11523,ARGUMENT,"Clandestine, forcing me to yield the prize."
11524,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd, and, as he bade, all present swore"
11525,ARGUMENT,"A solemn oath; then thus, amid them all                           70"
11526,ARGUMENT,"Standing, Telemachus majestic spake."
11527,ARGUMENT,Guest! if thy courage and thy manly mind
11528,ARGUMENT,"Prompt thee to banish this man hence, no force"
11529,ARGUMENT,"Fear thou beside, for who smites thee, shall find"
11530,ARGUMENT,Yet other foes to cope with; I am here
11531,ARGUMENT,"In the host's office, and the royal Chiefs"
11532,ARGUMENT,"Eurymachus and Antinoüs, alike"
11533,ARGUMENT,"Discrete, accord unanimous with me."
11534,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd, whom all approved. Then, with his rags"
11535,ARGUMENT,Ulysses braced for decency his loins                              80
11536,ARGUMENT,"Around, but gave to view his brawny thighs"
11537,ARGUMENT,"Proportion'd fair, and stripp'd his shoulders broad,"
11538,ARGUMENT,"His chest and arms robust; while, at his side,"
11539,ARGUMENT,Dilating more the Hero's limbs and more
11540,ARGUMENT,Minerva stood; the assembly with fixt eyes
11541,ARGUMENT,"Astonish'd gazed on him, and, looking full"
11542,ARGUMENT,"On his next friend, a suitor thus remark'd."
11543,ARGUMENT,Irus shall be in Irus found no more.
11544,ARGUMENT,He hath pull'd evil on himself. What thewes
11545,ARGUMENT,And what a haunch the senior's tatters hid!                       90
11546,ARGUMENT,So he--meantime in Irus' heart arose
11547,ARGUMENT,"Horrible tumult; yet, his loins by force"
11548,ARGUMENT,"Girding, the servants dragg'd him to the fight"
11549,ARGUMENT,"Pale, and his flesh all quiv'ring as he came;"
11550,ARGUMENT,Whose terrors thus Antinoüs sharp rebuked.
11551,ARGUMENT,"Now, wherefore liv'st, and why wast ever born"
11552,ARGUMENT,Thou mountain-mass of earth! if such dismay
11553,ARGUMENT,Shake thee at thought of combat with a man
11554,ARGUMENT,"Ancient as he, and worn with many woes?"
11555,ARGUMENT,"But mark, I threaten not in vain; should he                      100"
11556,ARGUMENT,"O'ercome thee, and in force superior prove,"
11557,ARGUMENT,To Echetus thou go'st; my sable bark
11558,ARGUMENT,"Shall waft thee to Epirus, where he reigns"
11559,ARGUMENT,Enemy of mankind; of nose and ears
11560,ARGUMENT,"He shall despoil thee with his ruthless steel,"
11561,ARGUMENT,And tearing by the roots the parts away[79]
11562,ARGUMENT,"That mark thy sex, shall cast them to the dogs."
11563,ARGUMENT,He said; _His_ limbs new terrors at that sound
11564,ARGUMENT,Shook under him; into the middle space
11565,ARGUMENT,"They led him, and each raised his hands on high.                 110"
11566,ARGUMENT,"Then doubtful stood Ulysses toil-inured,"
11567,ARGUMENT,Whether to strike him lifeless to the earth
11568,ARGUMENT,"At once, or fell him with a managed blow."
11569,ARGUMENT,To smite with managed force at length he chose
11570,ARGUMENT,"As wisest, lest, betray'd by his own strength,"
11571,ARGUMENT,He should be known. With elevated fists
11572,ARGUMENT,"Both stood; him Irus on the shoulder struck,"
11573,ARGUMENT,But he his adversary on the neck
11574,ARGUMENT,"Pash'd close beneath his ear; he split the bones,"
11575,ARGUMENT,And blood in sable streams ran from his mouth.                   120
11576,ARGUMENT,"With many an hideous yell he dropp'd, his teeth"
11577,ARGUMENT,"Chatter'd, and with his heels he drumm'd the ground."
11578,ARGUMENT,"The wooers, at that sight, lifting their hands"
11579,ARGUMENT,"In glad surprize, laugh'd all their breath away."
11580,ARGUMENT,"Then, through the vestibule, and right across"
11581,ARGUMENT,"The court, Ulysses dragg'd him by the foot"
11582,ARGUMENT,"Into the portico, where propping him"
11583,ARGUMENT,"Against the wall, and giving him his staff,"
11584,ARGUMENT,In accents wing'd he bade him thus farewell.
11585,ARGUMENT,"There seated now, dogs drive and swine away,                   130"
11586,ARGUMENT,Nor claim (thyself so base) supreme controul
11587,ARGUMENT,"O'er other guests and mendicants, lest harm"
11588,ARGUMENT,"Reach thee, hereafter, heavier still than this."
11589,ARGUMENT,"So saying, his tatter'd wallet o'er his back"
11590,ARGUMENT,"He threw suspended by its leathern twist,"
11591,ARGUMENT,"And tow'rd the threshold turning, sat again,"
11592,ARGUMENT,"They laughing ceaseless still, the palace-door"
11593,ARGUMENT,"Re-enter'd, and him, courteous, thus bespake."
11594,ARGUMENT,"Jove, and all Jove's assessors in the skies"
11595,ARGUMENT,"Vouchsafe thee, stranger, whatsoe'er it be,                      140"
11596,ARGUMENT,Thy heart's desire! who hast our ears reliev'd
11597,ARGUMENT,From that insatiate beggar's irksome tone.
11598,ARGUMENT,Soon to Epirus he shall go dispatch'd
11599,ARGUMENT,"To Echetus the King, pest of mankind."
11600,ARGUMENT,"So they, to whose propitious words the Chief"
11601,ARGUMENT,Listen'd delighted. Then Antinoüs placed
11602,ARGUMENT,"The paunch before him, and Amphinomus"
11603,ARGUMENT,"Two loaves, selected from the rest; he fill'd"
11604,ARGUMENT,"A goblet also, drank to him, and said,"
11605,ARGUMENT,"My father, hail! O stranger, be thy lot                        150"
11606,ARGUMENT,"Hereafter blest, though adverse now and hard!"
11607,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
11608,ARGUMENT,"To me, Amphinomus, endued thou seem'st"
11609,ARGUMENT,"With much discretion, who art also son"
11610,ARGUMENT,"Of such a sire, whose fair report I know,"
11611,ARGUMENT,"Dulichian Nysus, opulent and good."
11612,ARGUMENT,"Fame speaks thee his, and thou appear'st a man"
11613,ARGUMENT,"Judicious; hear me, therefore; mark me well."
11614,ARGUMENT,"Earth nourishes, of all that breathe or creep,"
11615,ARGUMENT,No creature weak as man; for while the Gods                      160
11616,ARGUMENT,"Grant him prosperity and health, no fear"
11617,ARGUMENT,"Hath he, or thought, that he shall ever mourn;"
11618,ARGUMENT,But when the Gods with evils unforeseen
11619,ARGUMENT,"Smite him, he bears them with a grudging mind;"
11620,ARGUMENT,For such as the complexion of his lot
11621,ARGUMENT,"By the appointment of the Sire of all,"
11622,ARGUMENT,Such is the colour of the mind of man.
11623,ARGUMENT,"I, too, have been familiar in my day"
11624,ARGUMENT,"With wealth and ease, but I was then self-will'd,"
11625,ARGUMENT,"And many wrong'd, embolden'd by the thought                      170"
11626,ARGUMENT,Of my own father's and my brethren's pow'r.
11627,ARGUMENT,"Let no man, therefore, be unjust, but each"
11628,ARGUMENT,Use modestly what gift soe'er of heav'n.
11629,ARGUMENT,So do not these. These ever bent I see
11630,ARGUMENT,"On deeds injurious, the possessions large"
11631,ARGUMENT,"Consuming, and dishonouring the wife"
11632,ARGUMENT,"Of one, who will not, as I judge, remain"
11633,ARGUMENT,"Long absent from his home, but is, perchance,"
11634,ARGUMENT,"Ev'n at the door. Thee, therefore, may the Gods"
11635,ARGUMENT,"Steal hence in time! ah, meet not his return                     180"
11636,ARGUMENT,"To his own country! for they will not part,"
11637,ARGUMENT,"(He and the suitors) without blood, I think,"
11638,ARGUMENT,If once he enter at these gates again!
11639,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and, libation pouring, quaff'd"
11640,ARGUMENT,"The generous juice, then in the prince's hand"
11641,ARGUMENT,"Replaced the cup; he, pensive, and his head"
11642,ARGUMENT,"Inclining low, pass'd from him; for his heart"
11643,ARGUMENT,"Forboded ill; yet 'scaped not even he,"
11644,ARGUMENT,"But in the snare of Pallas caught, his life"
11645,ARGUMENT,To the heroic arm and spear resign'd                             190
11646,ARGUMENT,"Of brave Telemachus. Reaching, at length,"
11647,ARGUMENT,"The seat whence he had ris'n, he sat again."
11648,ARGUMENT,"Minerva then, Goddess, cærulean-eyed,"
11649,ARGUMENT,Prompted Icarius' daughter to appear
11650,ARGUMENT,Before the suitors; so to expose the more
11651,ARGUMENT,"Their drift iniquitous, and that herself"
11652,ARGUMENT,More bright than ever in her husband's eyes
11653,ARGUMENT,"Might shine, and in her son's. Much mirth she feign'd,[80]"
11654,ARGUMENT,"And, bursting into laughter, thus began."
11655,ARGUMENT,"I wish, Eurynome! (who never felt                              200"
11656,ARGUMENT,"That wish till now) though I detest them all,"
11657,ARGUMENT,"To appear before the suitors, in whose ears"
11658,ARGUMENT,"I will admonish, for his good, my son,"
11659,ARGUMENT,Not to associate with that lawless crew
11660,ARGUMENT,"Too much, who speak him fair, but foul intend."
11661,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus Eurynome return'd.
11662,ARGUMENT,My daughter! wisely hast thou said and well.
11663,ARGUMENT,"Go! bathe thee and anoint thy face, then give"
11664,ARGUMENT,To thy dear son such counsel as thou wilt
11665,ARGUMENT,Without reserve; but shew not there thy cheeks                   210
11666,ARGUMENT,"Sullied with tears, for profit none accrues"
11667,ARGUMENT,"From grief like thine, that never knows a change."
11668,ARGUMENT,"And he is now bearded, and hath attained"
11669,ARGUMENT,That age which thou wast wont with warmest pray'r
11670,ARGUMENT,To implore the Gods that he might live to see.
11671,ARGUMENT,Her answer'd then Penelope discrete.
11672,ARGUMENT,"Persuade not me, though studious of my good,"
11673,ARGUMENT,"To bathe, Eurynome! or to anoint"
11674,ARGUMENT,My face with oil; for all my charms the Gods
11675,ARGUMENT,"Inhabitants of Olympus then destroy'd,                           220"
11676,ARGUMENT,"When he, embarking, left me. Go, command"
11677,ARGUMENT,Hippodamia and Autonöe
11678,ARGUMENT,"That they attend me to the hall, and wait"
11679,ARGUMENT,Beside me there; for decency forbids
11680,ARGUMENT,"That I should enter to the men, alone."
11681,ARGUMENT,"She ceas'd, and through the house the ancient dame"
11682,ARGUMENT,Hasted to summon whom she had enjoin'd.
11683,ARGUMENT,"But Pallas, Goddess of the azure eyes,"
11684,ARGUMENT,"Diffused, meantime, the kindly dew of sleep"
11685,ARGUMENT,Around Icarius' daughter; on her couch                           230
11686,ARGUMENT,"Reclining, soon as she reclin'd, she dozed,"
11687,ARGUMENT,And yielded to soft slumber all her frame.
11688,ARGUMENT,"Then, that the suitors might admire her more,"
11689,ARGUMENT,"The glorious Goddess cloath'd her, as she lay,"
11690,ARGUMENT,With beauty of the skies; her lovely face
11691,ARGUMENT,"She with ambrosia purified, with such"
11692,ARGUMENT,As Cytherea chaplet-crown'd employs
11693,ARGUMENT,"Herself, when in the eye-ensnaring dance"
11694,ARGUMENT,She joins the Graces; to a statelier height
11695,ARGUMENT,"Beneath her touch, and ampler size she grew,                     240"
11696,ARGUMENT,And fairer than the elephantine bone
11697,ARGUMENT,Fresh from the carver's hand. These gifts conferr'd
11698,ARGUMENT,"Divine, the awful Deity retired."
11699,ARGUMENT,"And now, loud-prattling as they came, arrived"
11700,ARGUMENT,"Her handmaids; sleep forsook her at the sound,"
11701,ARGUMENT,"She wiped away a tear, and thus she said."
11702,ARGUMENT,"Me gentle sleep, sad mourner as I am,"
11703,ARGUMENT,Hath here involved. O would that by a death
11704,ARGUMENT,As gentle chaste Diana would herself
11705,ARGUMENT,"This moment set me free, that I might waste                      250"
11706,ARGUMENT,My life no longer in heart-felt regret
11707,ARGUMENT,Of a lamented husband's various worth
11708,ARGUMENT,"And virtue, for in Greece no Peer had he!"
11709,ARGUMENT,"She said, and through her chambers' stately door"
11710,ARGUMENT,"Issuing, descended; neither went she sole,"
11711,ARGUMENT,But with those two fair menials of her train.
11712,ARGUMENT,"Arriving, most majestic of her sex,"
11713,ARGUMENT,"In presence of the num'rous guests, beneath"
11714,ARGUMENT,The portal of the stately dome she stood
11715,ARGUMENT,"Between her maidens, with her lucid veil                         260"
11716,ARGUMENT,"Mantling her lovely cheeks. Then, ev'ry knee"
11717,ARGUMENT,"Trembled, and ev'ry heart with am'rous heat"
11718,ARGUMENT,"Dissolv'd, her charms all coveting alike,"
11719,ARGUMENT,While to Telemachus her son she spake.
11720,ARGUMENT,Telemachus! thou art no longer wise
11721,ARGUMENT,"As once thou wast, and even when a child."
11722,ARGUMENT,"For thriven as thou art, and at full size"
11723,ARGUMENT,"Arrived of man, so fair proportion'd, too,"
11724,ARGUMENT,"That ev'n a stranger, looking on thy growth"
11725,ARGUMENT,"And beauty, would pronounce thee nobly born,                     270"
11726,ARGUMENT,Yet is thy intellect still immature.
11727,ARGUMENT,For what is this? why suffer'st thou a guest
11728,ARGUMENT,To be abused in thy own palace? how?
11729,ARGUMENT,Know'st not that if the stranger seated here
11730,ARGUMENT,"Endure vexation, the disgrace is thine?"
11731,ARGUMENT,"Her answer'd, then, Telemachus discrete."
11732,ARGUMENT,"I blame thee not, my mother, that thou feel'st"
11733,ARGUMENT,Thine anger moved; yet want I not a mind
11734,ARGUMENT,Able to mark and to discern between
11735,ARGUMENT,"Evil and good, child as I lately was,                            280"
11736,ARGUMENT,Although I find not promptitude of thought
11737,ARGUMENT,"Sufficient always, overaw'd and check'd"
11738,ARGUMENT,"By such a multitude, all bent alike"
11739,ARGUMENT,"On mischief, of whom none takes part with me."
11740,ARGUMENT,"But Irus and the stranger have not fought,"
11741,ARGUMENT,"Urged by the suitors, and the stranger prov'd"
11742,ARGUMENT,Victorious; yes--heav'n knows how much I wish
11743,ARGUMENT,"That, (in the palace some, some in the court)"
11744,ARGUMENT,"The suitors all sat vanquish'd, with their heads"
11745,ARGUMENT,"Depending low, and with enfeebled limbs,                         290"
11746,ARGUMENT,"Even as that same Irus, while I speak,"
11747,ARGUMENT,With chin on bosom propp'd at the hall-gate
11748,ARGUMENT,"Sits drunkard-like, incapable to stand"
11749,ARGUMENT,"Erect, or to regain his proper home."
11750,ARGUMENT,So they; and now addressing to the Queen
11751,ARGUMENT,"His speech, Eurymachus thus interposed."
11752,ARGUMENT,O daughter of Icarius! could all eyes
11753,ARGUMENT,"Throughout Iäsian Argos[81] view thy charms,"
11754,ARGUMENT,Discrete Penelope! more suitors still
11755,ARGUMENT,Assembling in thy courts would banquet here                      300
11756,ARGUMENT,From morn to eve; for thou surpassest far
11757,ARGUMENT,"In beauty, stature, worth, all womankind."
11758,ARGUMENT,To whom replied Penelope discrete.
11759,ARGUMENT,"The Gods, Eurymachus! reduced to nought"
11760,ARGUMENT,"My virtue, beauty, stature, when the Greeks,"
11761,ARGUMENT,"Whom my Ulysses follow'd, sail'd to Troy."
11762,ARGUMENT,"Could he, returning, my domestic charge"
11763,ARGUMENT,"Himself intend, far better would my fame"
11764,ARGUMENT,"Be so secured, and wider far diffused."
11765,ARGUMENT,"But I am wretched now, such storms the Gods                      310"
11766,ARGUMENT,"Of woe have sent me. When he left his home,"
11767,ARGUMENT,"Clasping my wrist with his right hand, he said."
11768,ARGUMENT,My love! for I imagine not that all
11769,ARGUMENT,"The warrior Greeks shall safe from Troy return,"
11770,ARGUMENT,"Since fame reports the Trojans brave in fight,"
11771,ARGUMENT,"Skill'd in the spear, mighty to draw the bow,"
11772,ARGUMENT,And nimble vaulters to the backs of steeds
11773,ARGUMENT,"High-mettled, which to speediest issue bring"
11774,ARGUMENT,The dreadful struggle of all-wasting war--
11775,ARGUMENT,"I know not, therefore, whether heav'n intend                     320"
11776,ARGUMENT,"My safe return, or I must perish there."
11777,ARGUMENT,"But manage thou at home. Cherish, as now,"
11778,ARGUMENT,"While I am absent, or more dearly still"
11779,ARGUMENT,"My parents, and what time our son thou seest"
11780,ARGUMENT,"Mature, then wed; wed even whom thou wilt,"
11781,ARGUMENT,"And hence to a new home.--Such were his words,"
11782,ARGUMENT,All which shall full accomplishment ere long
11783,ARGUMENT,"Receive. The day is near, when hapless I,"
11784,ARGUMENT,"Lost to all comfort by the will of Jove,"
11785,ARGUMENT,Must meet the nuptials that my soul abhors.                      330
11786,ARGUMENT,"But this thought now afflicts me, and my mind"
11787,ARGUMENT,Continual haunts. Such was not heretofore
11788,ARGUMENT,The suitors' custom'd practice; all who chose
11789,ARGUMENT,To engage in competition for a wife
11790,ARGUMENT,"Well-qualitied and well-endow'd, produced"
11791,ARGUMENT,From their own herds and fatted flocks a feast
11792,ARGUMENT,"For the bride's friends, and splendid presents made,"
11793,ARGUMENT,"But never ate as ye, at others' cost."
11794,ARGUMENT,She ceased; then brave Ulysses toil-inured
11795,ARGUMENT,"Rejoiced that, soothing them, she sought to draw                 340"
11796,ARGUMENT,"From each some gift, although on other views,"
11797,ARGUMENT,"And more important far, himself intent."
11798,ARGUMENT,"Then thus Antinoüs, Eupithes' son."
11799,ARGUMENT,Icarius' daughter wise! only accept
11800,ARGUMENT,"Such gifts as we shall bring, for gifts demand"
11801,ARGUMENT,"That grace, nor can be decently refused;"
11802,ARGUMENT,"But to our rural labours, or elsewhere"
11803,ARGUMENT,"Depart not we, till first thy choice be made"
11804,ARGUMENT,"Of the Achaian, chief in thy esteem."
11805,ARGUMENT,"Antinoüs spake, whose answer all approved.                     350"
11806,ARGUMENT,Then each dispatch'd his herald who should bring
11807,ARGUMENT,"His master's gift. Antinoüs' herald, first"
11808,ARGUMENT,"A mantle of surpassing beauty brought,"
11809,ARGUMENT,"Wide, various, with no fewer clasps adorn'd"
11810,ARGUMENT,"Than twelve, all golden, and to ev'ry clasp"
11811,ARGUMENT,Was fitted opposite its eye exact.
11812,ARGUMENT,"Next, to Eurymachus his herald bore"
11813,ARGUMENT,"A necklace of wrought gold, with amber rich"
11814,ARGUMENT,"Bestudded, ev'ry bead bright as a sun."
11815,ARGUMENT,Two servants for Eurydamas produced                              360
11816,ARGUMENT,"Ear-pendants fashion'd with laborious art,"
11817,ARGUMENT,"Broad, triple-gemm'd, of brilliant light profuse."
11818,ARGUMENT,"The herald of Polyctor's son, the prince"
11819,ARGUMENT,"Pisander, brought a collar to his Lord,"
11820,ARGUMENT,"A sumptuous ornament. Each Greecian gave,"
11821,ARGUMENT,And each a gift dissimilar from all.
11822,ARGUMENT,"Then, loveliest of her sex, turning away,"
11823,ARGUMENT,"She sought her chamber, whom her maidens fair"
11824,ARGUMENT,"Attended, charged with those illustrious gifts."
11825,ARGUMENT,"Then turn'd, they all to dance and pleasant song                 370"
11826,ARGUMENT,"Joyous, expecting the approach of ev'n."
11827,ARGUMENT,"Ere long the dusky evening came, and them"
11828,ARGUMENT,"Found sporting still. Then, placing in the hall"
11829,ARGUMENT,"Three hearths that should illumine wide the house,"
11830,ARGUMENT,They compass'd them around with fuel-wood
11831,ARGUMENT,"Long-season'd and new-split, mingling the sticks"
11832,ARGUMENT,With torches. The attendant women watch'd
11833,ARGUMENT,"And fed those fires by turns, to whom, himself,"
11834,ARGUMENT,Their unknown Sov'reign thus his speech address'd.
11835,ARGUMENT,Ye maidens of the long-regretted Chief                         380
11836,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses! to the inner-courts retire,"
11837,ARGUMENT,"And to your virtuous Queen, that following there"
11838,ARGUMENT,"Your sev'ral tasks, spinning and combing wool,"
11839,ARGUMENT,"Ye may amuse her; I, meantime, for these"
11840,ARGUMENT,"Will furnish light, and should they chuse to stay"
11841,ARGUMENT,"Till golden morn appear, they shall not tire"
11842,ARGUMENT,"My patience aught, for I can much endure."
11843,ARGUMENT,"He said; they, titt'ring, on each other gazed."
11844,ARGUMENT,"But one, Melantho with the blooming cheeks,"
11845,ARGUMENT,"Rebuked him rudely. Dolius was her sire,                         390"
11846,ARGUMENT,But by Penelope she had been reared
11847,ARGUMENT,"With care maternal, and in infant years"
11848,ARGUMENT,Supplied with many a toy; yet even she
11849,ARGUMENT,"Felt not her mistress' sorrows in her heart,"
11850,ARGUMENT,"But, of Eurymachus enamour'd, oft"
11851,ARGUMENT,"His lewd embraces met; she, with sharp speech"
11852,ARGUMENT,"Reproachful, to Ulysses thus replied."
11853,ARGUMENT,Why--what a brainsick vagabond art thou!
11854,ARGUMENT,Who neither wilt to the smith's forge retire
11855,ARGUMENT,"For sleep, nor to the public portico,                            400"
11856,ARGUMENT,"But here remaining, with audacious prate"
11857,ARGUMENT,"Disturb'st this num'rous company, restrain'd"
11858,ARGUMENT,By no respect or fear; either thou art
11859,ARGUMENT,"With wine intoxicated, or, perchance,"
11860,ARGUMENT,"Art always fool, and therefore babblest now."
11861,ARGUMENT,"Say, art thou drunk with joy that thou hast foiled"
11862,ARGUMENT,"The beggar Irus? Tremble, lest a man"
11863,ARGUMENT,"Stronger than Irus suddenly arise,"
11864,ARGUMENT,Who on thy temples pelting thee with blows
11865,ARGUMENT,"Far heavier than his, shall drive thee hence                     410"
11866,ARGUMENT,"With many a bruise, and foul with thy own blood."
11867,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, frowning stern, replied."
11868,ARGUMENT,Snarler! Telemachus shall be inform'd
11869,ARGUMENT,"This moment of thy eloquent harangue,"
11870,ARGUMENT,"That he may hew thee for it, limb from limb."
11871,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he scared the women; back they flew"
11872,ARGUMENT,"Into the house, but each with falt'ring knees"
11873,ARGUMENT,"Through dread, for they believ'd his threats sincere."
11874,ARGUMENT,"He, then illumin'd by the triple blaze,"
11875,ARGUMENT,"Watch'd close the lights, busy from hearth to hearth,            420"
11876,ARGUMENT,"But in his soul, meantime, far other thoughts"
11877,ARGUMENT,"Revolved, tremendous, not conceived in vain."
11878,ARGUMENT,Nor Pallas (that they might exasp'rate more
11879,ARGUMENT,Laertes' son) permitted to abstain
11880,ARGUMENT,From heart-corroding bitterness of speech
11881,ARGUMENT,"Those suitors proud, of whom Eurymachus,"
11882,ARGUMENT,"Offspring of Polybus, while thus he jeer'd"
11883,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, set the others in a roar."
11884,ARGUMENT,"Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious Queen!"
11885,ARGUMENT,"I shall promulge my thought. This man, methinks,                 430"
11886,ARGUMENT,"Not unconducted by the Gods, hath reach'd"
11887,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses' mansion, for to me the light"
11888,ARGUMENT,Of yonder torches altogether seems
11889,ARGUMENT,"His own, an emanation from his head,"
11890,ARGUMENT,Which not the smallest growth of hair obscures.
11891,ARGUMENT,He ended; and the city-waster Chief
11892,ARGUMENT,Himself accosted next. Art thou disposed
11893,ARGUMENT,"To serve me, friend! would I afford thee hire,"
11894,ARGUMENT,A labourer at my farm? thou shalt not want
11895,ARGUMENT,Sufficient wages; thou may'st there collect                      440
11896,ARGUMENT,"Stones for my fences, and may'st plant my oaks,"
11897,ARGUMENT,For which I would supply thee all the year
11898,ARGUMENT,"With food, and cloaths, and sandals for thy feet."
11899,ARGUMENT,"But thou hast learn'd less creditable arts,"
11900,ARGUMENT,"Nor hast a will to work, preferring much"
11901,ARGUMENT,By beggary from others to extort
11902,ARGUMENT,Wherewith to feed thy never-sated maw.
11903,ARGUMENT,"Then answer, thus, Ulysses wise return'd."
11904,ARGUMENT,"Forbear, Eurymachus; for were we match'd"
11905,ARGUMENT,"In work against each other, thou and I,                          450"
11906,ARGUMENT,"Mowing in spring-time, when the days are long,"
11907,ARGUMENT,"I with my well-bent sickle in my hand,"
11908,ARGUMENT,"Thou arm'd with one as keen, for trial sake"
11909,ARGUMENT,Of our ability to toil unfed
11910,ARGUMENT,"Till night, grass still sufficing for the proof.--"
11911,ARGUMENT,"Or if, again, it were our task to drive"
11912,ARGUMENT,"Yoked oxen of the noblest breed, sleek-hair'd,"
11913,ARGUMENT,"Big-limb'd, both batten'd to the full with grass,"
11914,ARGUMENT,Their age and aptitude for work the same
11915,ARGUMENT,"Not soon to be fatigued, and were the field                      460"
11916,ARGUMENT,"In size four acres, with a glebe through which"
11917,ARGUMENT,"The share might smoothly slide, then should'st thou see"
11918,ARGUMENT,How strait my furrow should be cut and true.--
11919,ARGUMENT,Or should Saturnian Jove this day excite
11920,ARGUMENT,"Here, battle, or elsewhere, and were I arm'd"
11921,ARGUMENT,"With two bright spears and with a shield, and bore"
11922,ARGUMENT,"A brazen casque well-fitted to my brows,"
11923,ARGUMENT,"Me, then, thou should'st perceive mingling in fight"
11924,ARGUMENT,"Amid the foremost Chiefs, nor with the crime"
11925,ARGUMENT,Of idle beggary should'st upbraid me more.                       470
11926,ARGUMENT,"But thou art much a railer, one whose heart"
11927,ARGUMENT,"Pity moves not, and seem'st a mighty man"
11928,ARGUMENT,"And valiant to thyself, only because"
11929,ARGUMENT,"Thou herd'st with few, and those of little worth."
11930,ARGUMENT,"But should Ulysses come, at his own isle"
11931,ARGUMENT,"Again arrived, wide as these portals are,"
11932,ARGUMENT,"To thee, at once, too narrow they should seem"
11933,ARGUMENT,To shoot thee forth with speed enough abroad.
11934,ARGUMENT,He ceased--then tenfold indignation fired
11935,ARGUMENT,Eurymachus; he furrow'd deep his brow                            480
11936,ARGUMENT,"With frowns, and in wing'd accents thus replied."
11937,ARGUMENT,"Wretch, I shall roughly handle thee anon,"
11938,ARGUMENT,Who thus with fluent prate presumptuous dar'st
11939,ARGUMENT,"Disturb this num'rous company, restrain'd"
11940,ARGUMENT,By no respect or fear. Either thou art
11941,ARGUMENT,"With wine intoxicated, or, perchance,"
11942,ARGUMENT,"Art always fool, and therefore babblest now;"
11943,ARGUMENT,Or thou art frantic haply with delight
11944,ARGUMENT,That thou hast foil'd yon vagabond obscure.
11945,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he seized a stool; but to the knees                 490"
11946,ARGUMENT,Ulysses flew of the Dulichian Prince
11947,ARGUMENT,"Amphinomus, and sat, fearing incensed"
11948,ARGUMENT,Eurymachus; he on his better hand
11949,ARGUMENT,Smote full the cup-bearer; on the hall-floor
11950,ARGUMENT,"Loud rang the fallen beaker, and himself"
11951,ARGUMENT,Lay on his back clamouring in the dust.
11952,ARGUMENT,Strait through the dusky hall tumult ensued
11953,ARGUMENT,"Among the suitors, of whom thus, a youth,"
11954,ARGUMENT,"With eyes directed to the next, exclaim'd."
11955,ARGUMENT,Would that this rambling stranger had elsewhere                500
11956,ARGUMENT,"Perish'd, or ever he had here arrived,"
11957,ARGUMENT,Then no such uproar had he caused as this!
11958,ARGUMENT,This doth the beggar; he it is for whom
11959,ARGUMENT,"We wrangle thus, and may despair of peace"
11960,ARGUMENT,Or pleasure more; now look for strife alone.
11961,ARGUMENT,Then in the midst Telemachus upstood
11962,ARGUMENT,"Majestic, and the suitors thus bespake."
11963,ARGUMENT,"Sirs! ye are mad, and can no longer eat"
11964,ARGUMENT,Or drink in peace; some dæmon troubles you.
11965,ARGUMENT,"But since ye all have feasted, to your homes                     510"
11966,ARGUMENT,"Go now, and, at your pleasure, to your beds;"
11967,ARGUMENT,"Soonest were best, but I thrust no man hence."
11968,ARGUMENT,"He ceased; they gnawing stood their lips, aghast"
11969,ARGUMENT,With wonder that Telemachus in his speech
11970,ARGUMENT,"Such boldness used. Then rose Amphinomus,"
11971,ARGUMENT,Brave son of Nisus offspring of the King
11972,ARGUMENT,"Aretus, and the assembly thus address'd."
11973,ARGUMENT,My friends! let none with contradiction thwart
11974,ARGUMENT,And rude reply words rational and just;
11975,ARGUMENT,"Assault no more the stranger, nor of all                         520"
11976,ARGUMENT,The servants of renown'd Ulysses here
11977,ARGUMENT,Harm any. Come. Let the cup-bearer fill
11978,ARGUMENT,"To all, that due libation made, to rest"
11979,ARGUMENT,"We may repair at home, leaving the Prince"
11980,ARGUMENT,To accommodate beneath his father's roof
11981,ARGUMENT,"The stranger, for he is the Prince's guest."
11982,ARGUMENT,"He ended, whose advice none disapproved."
11983,ARGUMENT,"The Hero Mulius then, Dulichian-born,"
11984,ARGUMENT,"And herald of Amphinomus, the cup"
11985,ARGUMENT,"Filling, dispensed it, as he stood, to all;                      530"
11986,ARGUMENT,"They, pouring forth to the Immortals, quaff'd"
11987,ARGUMENT,"The luscious bev'rage, and when each had made"
11988,ARGUMENT,"Libation, and such measure as he would"
11989,ARGUMENT,"Of wine had drunk, then all to rest retired."

12009,ARGUMENT,Ulysses and Telemachus remove the arms from the hall to an upper-chamber.
12010,ARGUMENT,"The Hero then confers with Penelope, to whom he gives a fictitious"
12011,ARGUMENT,"narrative of his adventures. Euryclea, while bathing Ulysses, discovers"
12012,ARGUMENT,"him by a scar on his knee, but he prevents her communication of that"
12013,ARGUMENT,discovery to Penelope.
12014,ARGUMENT,
12015,ARGUMENT,
12016,ARGUMENT,"They went, but left the noble Chief behind"
12017,ARGUMENT,"In his own house, contriving by the aid"
12018,ARGUMENT,"Of Pallas, the destruction of them all,"
12019,ARGUMENT,"And thus, in accents wing'd, again he said."
12020,ARGUMENT,My son! we must remove and safe dispose
12021,ARGUMENT,All these my well-forged implements of war;
12022,ARGUMENT,"And should the suitors, missing them, enquire"
12023,ARGUMENT,Where are they? thou shalt answer smoothly thus--
12024,ARGUMENT,"I have convey'd them from the reach of smoke,"
12025,ARGUMENT,For they appear no more the same which erst                       10
12026,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, going hence to Ilium, left,"
12027,ARGUMENT,So smirch'd and sullied by the breath of fire.
12028,ARGUMENT,This weightier reason (thou shalt also say)
12029,ARGUMENT,"Some God suggested to me,--lest, inflamed"
12030,ARGUMENT,"With wine, ye wound each other in your brawls,"
12031,ARGUMENT,Shaming both feast and courtship; for the view
12032,ARGUMENT,Itself of arms incites to their abuse.
12033,ARGUMENT,"He ceased, and, in obedience to his will,"
12034,ARGUMENT,"Calling the ancient Euryclea forth,"
12035,ARGUMENT,"His nurse, Telemachus enjoin'd her thus.                          20"
12036,ARGUMENT,Go--shut the women in; make fast the doors
12037,ARGUMENT,"Of their apartment, while I safe dispose"
12038,ARGUMENT,"Elsewhere, my father's implements of war,"
12039,ARGUMENT,"Which, during his long absence, here have stood"
12040,ARGUMENT,Till smoke hath sullied them. For I have been
12041,ARGUMENT,"An infant hitherto, but, wiser grown,"
12042,ARGUMENT,Would now remove them from the breath of fire.
12043,ARGUMENT,Then thus the gentle matron in return.
12044,ARGUMENT,"Yes truly--and I wish that now, at length,"
12045,ARGUMENT,"Thou would'st assert the privilege of thy years,                  30"
12046,ARGUMENT,"My son, thyself assuming charge of all,"
12047,ARGUMENT,Both house and stores; but who shall bear the light?
12048,ARGUMENT,"Since they, it seems, who would, are all forbidden."
12049,ARGUMENT,To whom Telemachus discrete replied.
12050,ARGUMENT,"This guest; for no man, from my table fed,"
12051,ARGUMENT,Come whence he may; shall be an idler here.
12052,ARGUMENT,"He ended, nor his words flew wing'd away,"
12053,ARGUMENT,But Euryclea bolted every door.
12054,ARGUMENT,"Then, starting to the task, Ulysses caught,"
12055,ARGUMENT,"And his illustrious son, the weapons thence,                      40"
12056,ARGUMENT,"Helmet, and bossy shield, and pointed spear,"
12057,ARGUMENT,While Pallas from a golden lamp illumed
12058,ARGUMENT,The dusky way before them. At that sight
12059,ARGUMENT,"Alarm'd, the Prince his father thus address'd."
12060,ARGUMENT,"Whence--whence is this, my father? I behold"
12061,ARGUMENT,"A prodigy! the walls of the whole house,"
12062,ARGUMENT,"The arches, fir-tree beams, and pillars tall"
12063,ARGUMENT,"Shine in my view, as with the blaze of fire!"
12064,ARGUMENT,"Some Pow'r celestial, doubtless, is within."
12065,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.                            50"
12066,ARGUMENT,"Soft! ask no questions. Give no vent to thought,"
12067,ARGUMENT,Such is the custom of the Pow'rs divine.
12068,ARGUMENT,"Hence, thou, to bed. I stay, that I may yet"
12069,ARGUMENT,Both in thy mother and her maidens move
12070,ARGUMENT,More curiosity; yes--she with tears
12071,ARGUMENT,Shall question me of all that I have seen.
12072,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and the Prince, at his command,"
12073,ARGUMENT,"Guided by flaming torches, sought the couch"
12074,ARGUMENT,"Where he was wont to sleep, and there he slept"
12075,ARGUMENT,"On that night also, waiting the approach                          60"
12076,ARGUMENT,Of sacred dawn. Thus was Ulysses left
12077,ARGUMENT,"Alone, and planning sat in solitude,"
12078,ARGUMENT,"By Pallas' aid, the slaughter of his foes."
12079,ARGUMENT,"At length, Diana-like, or like herself,"
12080,ARGUMENT,"All golden Venus, (her apartment left)"
12081,ARGUMENT,Enter'd Penelope. Beside the hearth
12082,ARGUMENT,Her women planted her accustom'd seat
12083,ARGUMENT,With silver wreathed and ivory. That throne
12084,ARGUMENT,"Icmalius made, artist renown'd, and join'd"
12085,ARGUMENT,"A footstool to its splendid frame beneath,                        70"
12086,ARGUMENT,Which ever with an ample fleece they spread.
12087,ARGUMENT,There sat discrete Penelope; then came
12088,ARGUMENT,"Her beautiful attendants from within,"
12089,ARGUMENT,"Who cleared the litter'd bread, the board, and cups"
12090,ARGUMENT,From which the insolent companions drank.
12091,ARGUMENT,They also raked the embers from the hearths
12092,ARGUMENT,"Now dim, and with fresh billets piled them high,"
12093,ARGUMENT,Both for illumination and for warmth.
12094,ARGUMENT,Then yet again Melantho with rude speech
12095,ARGUMENT,"Opprobrious, thus, assail'd Ulysses' ear.                         80"
12096,ARGUMENT,Guest--wilt thou trouble us throughout the night
12097,ARGUMENT,Ranging the house? and linger'st thou a spy
12098,ARGUMENT,Watching the women? Hence--get thee abroad
12099,ARGUMENT,"Glad of such fare as thou hast found, or soon"
12100,ARGUMENT,With torches beaten we will thrust thee forth.
12101,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, frowning stern, replied."
12102,ARGUMENT,Petulant woman! wherefore thus incensed
12103,ARGUMENT,Inveigh'st thou against me? is it because
12104,ARGUMENT,I am not sleek? because my garb is mean?
12105,ARGUMENT,Because I beg? thanks to necessity--                              90
12106,ARGUMENT,"I would not else. But such as I appear,"
12107,ARGUMENT,Such all who beg and all who wander are.
12108,ARGUMENT,I also lived the happy owner once
12109,ARGUMENT,"Of such a stately mansion, and have giv'n"
12110,ARGUMENT,"To num'rous wand'rers, whencesoe'er they came,"
12111,ARGUMENT,All that they needed; I was also served
12112,ARGUMENT,"By many, and enjoy'd all that denotes"
12113,ARGUMENT,The envied owner opulent and blest.
12114,ARGUMENT,But Jove (for so it pleas'd him) hath reduced
12115,ARGUMENT,My all to nothing. Therefore well beware                         100
12116,ARGUMENT,"Thou also, mistress, lest a day arrive"
12117,ARGUMENT,When all these charms by which thou shin'st among
12118,ARGUMENT,"Thy sister-menials, fade; fear, too, lest her"
12119,ARGUMENT,"Thou should'st perchance irritate, whom thou serv'st,"
12120,ARGUMENT,"And lest Ulysses come, of whose return"
12121,ARGUMENT,Hope yet survives; but even though the Chief
12122,ARGUMENT,"Have perish'd, as ye think, and comes no more,"
12123,ARGUMENT,"Consider yet his son, how bright the gifts"
12124,ARGUMENT,Shine of Apollo in the illustrious Prince
12125,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus; no woman, unobserved                                 110"
12126,ARGUMENT,"By him, can now commit a trespass here;"
12127,ARGUMENT,His days of heedless infancy are past.
12128,ARGUMENT,"He ended, whom Penelope discrete"
12129,ARGUMENT,"O'erhearing, her attendant sharp rebuked."
12130,ARGUMENT,"Shameless, audacious woman! known to me"
12131,ARGUMENT,"Is thy great wickedness, which with thy life"
12132,ARGUMENT,"Thou shalt atone; for thou wast well aware,"
12133,ARGUMENT,(Hearing it from myself) that I design'd
12134,ARGUMENT,"To ask this stranger of my absent Lord,"
12135,ARGUMENT,For whose dear sake I never cease to mourn.                      120
12136,ARGUMENT,Then to her household's governess she said.
12137,ARGUMENT,"Bring now a seat, and spread it with a fleece,"
12138,ARGUMENT,"Eurynome! that, undisturb'd, the guest"
12139,ARGUMENT,May hear and answer all that I shall ask.
12140,ARGUMENT,She ended. Then the matron brought in haste
12141,ARGUMENT,"A polish'd seat, and spread it with a fleece,"
12142,ARGUMENT,"On which the toil-accustom'd Hero sat,"
12143,ARGUMENT,And thus the chaste Penelope began.
12144,ARGUMENT,Stranger! my first enquiry shall be this--
12145,ARGUMENT,Who art thou? whence? where born? and sprung from whom?          130
12146,ARGUMENT,"Then answer thus Ulysses, wise, return'd."
12147,ARGUMENT,O Queen! uncensurable by the lips
12148,ARGUMENT,Of mortal man! thy glory climbs the skies
12149,ARGUMENT,"Unrivall'd, like the praise of some great King"
12150,ARGUMENT,Who o'er a num'rous people and renown'd
12151,ARGUMENT,"Presiding like a Deity, maintains"
12152,ARGUMENT,"Justice and truth. The earth, under his sway,"
12153,ARGUMENT,Her produce yields abundantly; the trees
12154,ARGUMENT,Fruit-laden bend; the lusty flocks bring forth;
12155,ARGUMENT,The Ocean teems with finny swarms beneath                        140
12156,ARGUMENT,"His just controul, and all the land is blest."
12157,ARGUMENT,"Me therefore, question of what else thou wilt"
12158,ARGUMENT,"In thy own palace, but forbear to ask"
12159,ARGUMENT,"From whom I sprang, and of my native land,"
12160,ARGUMENT,"Lest thou, reminding me of those sad themes,"
12161,ARGUMENT,Augment my woes; for I have much endured;
12162,ARGUMENT,"Nor were it seemly, in another's house,"
12163,ARGUMENT,"To pass the hours in sorrow and in tears,"
12164,ARGUMENT,Wearisome when indulg'd with no regard
12165,ARGUMENT,To time or place; thy train (perchance thyself)                  150
12166,ARGUMENT,"Would blame me, and I should reproach incur"
12167,ARGUMENT,As one tear-deluged through excess of wine.
12168,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then Penelope discrete.
12169,ARGUMENT,"The immortal Gods, O stranger, then destroy'd"
12170,ARGUMENT,"My form, my grace, my beauty, when the Greeks"
12171,ARGUMENT,"Whom my Ulysses follow'd, sail'd to Troy."
12172,ARGUMENT,"Could he, returning, my domestic charge"
12173,ARGUMENT,"Himself intend, far better would my fame"
12174,ARGUMENT,"Be so secured, and wider far diffused."
12175,ARGUMENT,"But I am wretched now, such storms of woe                        160"
12176,ARGUMENT,The Gods have sent me; for as many Chiefs
12177,ARGUMENT,As hold dominion in the neighbour isles
12178,ARGUMENT,"Samos, Dulichium, and the forest-crown'd"
12179,ARGUMENT,"Zacynthus; others, also, rulers here"
12180,ARGUMENT,"In pleasant Ithaca, me, loth to wed,"
12181,ARGUMENT,"Woo ceaseless, and my household stores consume."
12182,ARGUMENT,"I therefore, neither guest nor suppliant heed,"
12183,ARGUMENT,"Nor public herald more, but with regret"
12184,ARGUMENT,Of my Ulysses wear my soul away.
12185,ARGUMENT,"They, meantime, press my nuptials, which by art                  170"
12186,ARGUMENT,I still procrastinate. Some God the thought
12187,ARGUMENT,"Suggested to me, to commence a robe"
12188,ARGUMENT,"Of amplest measure and of subtlest woof,"
12189,ARGUMENT,"Laborious task; which done, I thus address'd them."
12190,ARGUMENT,"Princes, my suitors! since the noble Chief"
12191,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses is no more, enforce not now"
12192,ARGUMENT,My nuptials; wait till I shall finish first
12193,ARGUMENT,A fun'ral robe (lest all my threads be marr'd)
12194,ARGUMENT,Which for the ancient Hero I prepare
12195,ARGUMENT,"Laertes, looking for the mournful hour                           180"
12196,ARGUMENT,When fate shall snatch him to eternal rest.
12197,ARGUMENT,"Else, I the censure dread of all my sex,"
12198,ARGUMENT,"Should he, so wealthy, want at last a shroud."
12199,ARGUMENT,"Such was my speech; they, unsuspicious all,"
12200,ARGUMENT,"With my request complied. Thenceforth, all day"
12201,ARGUMENT,"I wove the ample web, and, by the aid"
12202,ARGUMENT,"Of torches, ravell'd it again at night."
12203,ARGUMENT,Three years by artifice I thus their suit
12204,ARGUMENT,"Eluded safe; but when the fourth arrived,"
12205,ARGUMENT,And the same season after many moons                             190
12206,ARGUMENT,"And fleeting days return'd, passing my train"
12207,ARGUMENT,"Who had neglected to release the dogs,"
12208,ARGUMENT,"They came, surprized and reprimanded me."
12209,ARGUMENT,"Thus, through necessity, not choice, at last"
12210,ARGUMENT,"I have perform'd it, in my own despight."
12211,ARGUMENT,"But no escape from marriage now remains,"
12212,ARGUMENT,Nor other subterfuge for me; meantime
12213,ARGUMENT,"My parents urge my nuptials, and my son"
12214,ARGUMENT,(Of age to note it) with disgust observes
12215,ARGUMENT,His wealth consumed; for he is now become                        200
12216,ARGUMENT,"Adult, and abler than myself to rule"
12217,ARGUMENT,"The house, a Prince distinguish'd by the Gods,"
12218,ARGUMENT,"Yet, stranger, after all, speak thy descent;"
12219,ARGUMENT,Say whence thou art; for not of fabulous birth
12220,ARGUMENT,"Art thou, nor from the oak, nor from the rock."
12221,ARGUMENT,"Her answer'd then Ulysses, ever-wise."
12222,ARGUMENT,O spouse revered of Laertiades!
12223,ARGUMENT,Resolv'st thou still to learn from whom I sprang?
12224,ARGUMENT,Learn then; but know that thou shalt much augment
12225,ARGUMENT,"My present grief, natural to a man                               210"
12226,ARGUMENT,"Who hath, like me, long exiled from his home"
12227,ARGUMENT,Through various cities of the sons of men
12228,ARGUMENT,"Wander'd remote, and num'rous woes endured."
12229,ARGUMENT,"Yet, though it pain me, I will tell thee all."
12230,ARGUMENT,There is a land amid the sable flood
12231,ARGUMENT,"Call'd Crete; fair, fruitful, circled by the sea."
12232,ARGUMENT,"Num'rous are her inhabitants, a race"
12233,ARGUMENT,"Not to be summ'd, and ninety towns she boasts."
12234,ARGUMENT,"Diverse their language is; Achaians some,"
12235,ARGUMENT,"And some indigenous are; Cydonians there,                        220"
12236,ARGUMENT,"Crest-shaking Dorians, and Pelasgians dwell."
12237,ARGUMENT,"One city in extent the rest exceeds,"
12238,ARGUMENT,"Cnossus; the city in which Minos reign'd,"
12239,ARGUMENT,"Who, ever at a nine years' close, conferr'd"
12240,ARGUMENT,With Jove himself; from him my father sprang
12241,ARGUMENT,The brave Deucalion; for Deucalion's sons
12242,ARGUMENT,"Were two, myself and King Idomeneus."
12243,ARGUMENT,"To Ilium he, on board his gallant barks,"
12244,ARGUMENT,"Follow'd the Atridæ. I, the youngest-born,"
12245,ARGUMENT,"By my illustrious name, Æthon, am known,                         230"
12246,ARGUMENT,But he ranks foremost both in worth and years.
12247,ARGUMENT,"There I beheld Ulysses, and within"
12248,ARGUMENT,My walls receiv'd him; for a violent wind
12249,ARGUMENT,Had driv'n him from Malea (while he sought
12250,ARGUMENT,The shores of Troy) to Crete. The storm his barks
12251,ARGUMENT,"Bore into the Amnisus, for the cave"
12252,ARGUMENT,"Of Ilythia known, a dang'rous port,"
12253,ARGUMENT,And which with difficulty he attain'd.
12254,ARGUMENT,"He, landing, instant to the city went,"
12255,ARGUMENT,"Seeking Idomeneus; his friend of old,                            240"
12256,ARGUMENT,"As he affirm'd, and one whom much he lov'd."
12257,ARGUMENT,"But _he_ was far remote, ten days advanced,"
12258,ARGUMENT,"Perhaps eleven, on his course to Troy."
12259,ARGUMENT,"Him, therefore, I conducted to my home,"
12260,ARGUMENT,"Where hospitably, and with kindest care"
12261,ARGUMENT,"I entertain'd him, (for I wanted nought)"
12262,ARGUMENT,"And for himself procured and for his band,--"
12263,ARGUMENT,"By public contribution, corn, and wine,"
12264,ARGUMENT,"And beeves for food, that all might be sufficed."
12265,ARGUMENT,"Twelve days his noble Greecians there abode,                     250"
12266,ARGUMENT,Port-lock'd by Boreas blowing with a force
12267,ARGUMENT,"Resistless even on the land, some God"
12268,ARGUMENT,So roused his fury; but the thirteenth day
12269,ARGUMENT,"The wind all fell, and they embark'd again."
12270,ARGUMENT,"With many a fiction specious, as he sat,"
12271,ARGUMENT,He thus her ear amused; she at the sound
12272,ARGUMENT,"Melting, with fluent tears her cheeks bedew'd;"
12273,ARGUMENT,"And as the snow by Zephyrus diffused,"
12274,ARGUMENT,"Melts on the mountain tops, when Eurus breathes,"
12275,ARGUMENT,"And fills the channels of the running streams,                   260"
12276,ARGUMENT,"So melted she, and down her lovely cheeks"
12277,ARGUMENT,"Pour'd fast the tears, him mourning as remote"
12278,ARGUMENT,Who sat beside her. Soft compassion touch'd
12279,ARGUMENT,Ulysses of his consort's silent woe;
12280,ARGUMENT,"His eyes as they had been of steel or horn,"
12281,ARGUMENT,"Moved not, yet artful, he suppress'd his tears,"
12282,ARGUMENT,"And she, at length with overflowing grief"
12283,ARGUMENT,"Satiate, replied, and thus enquired again."
12284,ARGUMENT,"Now, stranger, I shall prove thee, as I judge,"
12285,ARGUMENT,"If thou, indeed, hast entertain'd in Crete                       270"
12286,ARGUMENT,"My spouse and his brave followers, as thou say'st."
12287,ARGUMENT,Describe his raiment and himself; his own
12288,ARGUMENT,"Appearance, and the appearance of his friends."
12289,ARGUMENT,"Then her Ulysses answer'd, ever-wise."
12290,ARGUMENT,"Hard is the task, O Queen! (so long a time"
12291,ARGUMENT,Hath since elaps'd) to tell thee. Twenty years
12292,ARGUMENT,"Have pass'd since he forsook my native isle,"
12293,ARGUMENT,"Yet, from my best remembrance, I will give"
12294,ARGUMENT,"A likeness of him, such as now I may."
12295,ARGUMENT,"A double cloak, thick-piled, Mœonian dyed,                       280"
12296,ARGUMENT,The noble Chief had on; two fast'nings held
12297,ARGUMENT,"The golden clasp, and it display'd in front"
12298,ARGUMENT,A well-wrought pattern with much art design'd.
12299,ARGUMENT,An hound between his fore-feet holding fast
12300,ARGUMENT,"A dappled fawn, gaped eager on his prey."
12301,ARGUMENT,"All wonder'd, seeing, how in lifeless gold"
12302,ARGUMENT,"Express'd, the dog with open mouth her throat"
12303,ARGUMENT,"Attempted still, and how the fawn with hoofs"
12304,ARGUMENT,"Thrust trembling forward, struggled to escape."
12305,ARGUMENT,"That glorious mantle much I noticed, soft                        290"
12306,ARGUMENT,"To touch, as the dried garlick's glossy film;"
12307,ARGUMENT,"Such was the smoothness of it, and it shone"
12308,ARGUMENT,"Sun-bright; full many a maiden, trust me, view'd"
12309,ARGUMENT,The splendid texture with admiring eyes.
12310,ARGUMENT,But mark me now; deep treasure in thy mind
12311,ARGUMENT,This word. I know not if Ulysses wore
12312,ARGUMENT,"That cloak at home, or whether of his train"
12313,ARGUMENT,"Some warrior gave it to him on his way,"
12314,ARGUMENT,Or else some host of his; for many loved
12315,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, and with him might few compare.                         300"
12316,ARGUMENT,"I gave to him, myself, a brazen sword,"
12317,ARGUMENT,"A purple cloak magnificent, and vest"
12318,ARGUMENT,"Of royal length, and when he sought his bark,"
12319,ARGUMENT,With princely pomp dismiss'd him from the shore.
12320,ARGUMENT,"An herald also waited on the Chief,"
12321,ARGUMENT,Somewhat his Senior; him I next describe.
12322,ARGUMENT,"His back was bunch'd, his visage swarthy, curl'd"
12323,ARGUMENT,"His poll, and he was named Eurybates;"
12324,ARGUMENT,A man whom most of all his followers far
12325,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses honour'd, for their minds were one.                      310"
12326,ARGUMENT,He ceased; she recognising all the proofs
12327,ARGUMENT,"Distinctly by Ulysses named, was moved"
12328,ARGUMENT,"Still more to weep, till with o'erflowing grief"
12329,ARGUMENT,"Satiate, at length she answer'd him again."
12330,ARGUMENT,"Henceforth, O stranger, thou who hadst before"
12331,ARGUMENT,"My pity, shalt my rev'rence share and love,"
12332,ARGUMENT,I folded for him (with these hands) the cloak
12333,ARGUMENT,"Which thou describ'st, produced it when he went,"
12334,ARGUMENT,And gave it to him; I that splendid clasp
12335,ARGUMENT,"Attach'd to it myself, more to adorn                             320"
12336,ARGUMENT,"My honour'd Lord, whom to his native land"
12337,ARGUMENT,Return'd secure I shall receive no more.
12338,ARGUMENT,In such an evil hour Ulysses went
12339,ARGUMENT,To that bad city never to be named.
12340,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
12341,ARGUMENT,Consort revered of Laertiades!
12342,ARGUMENT,No longer let anxiety impair
12343,ARGUMENT,"Thy beauteous form, nor any grief consume"
12344,ARGUMENT,Thy spirits more for thy Ulysses' sake.
12345,ARGUMENT,And yet I blame thee not; a wife deprived                        330
12346,ARGUMENT,Of her first mate to whom she had produced
12347,ARGUMENT,"Fair fruit of mutual love, would mourn his loss,"
12348,ARGUMENT,"Although he were inferior far to thine,"
12349,ARGUMENT,Whom fame affirms the semblance of the Gods.
12350,ARGUMENT,But cease to mourn. Hear me. I will relate
12351,ARGUMENT,"A faithful tale, nor will from thee withhold"
12352,ARGUMENT,"Such tidings of Ulysses living still,"
12353,ARGUMENT,"And of his safe return, as I have heard"
12354,ARGUMENT,"Lately, in yon neighb'ring opulent land"
12355,ARGUMENT,Of the Thesprotians. He returns enrich'd                         340
12356,ARGUMENT,With many precious stores from those obtain'd
12357,ARGUMENT,"Whom he hath visited; but he hath lost,"
12358,ARGUMENT,"Departing from Thrinacia's isle, his bark"
12359,ARGUMENT,"And all his lov'd companions in the Deep,"
12360,ARGUMENT,"For Jove was adverse to him, and the Sun,"
12361,ARGUMENT,Whose beeves his followers slew. They perish'd all
12362,ARGUMENT,"Amid the billowy flood; but Him, the keel"
12363,ARGUMENT,"Bestriding of his bark, the waves at length"
12364,ARGUMENT,"Cast forth on the Phæacian's land, a race"
12365,ARGUMENT,"Allied to heav'n, who rev'renced like a God                      350"
12366,ARGUMENT,"Thy husband, honour'd him with num'rous gifts,"
12367,ARGUMENT,And willing were to have convey'd him home.
12368,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, therefore, had attained long since"
12369,ARGUMENT,"His native shore, but that he deem'd it best"
12370,ARGUMENT,"To travel far, that he might still amass"
12371,ARGUMENT,More wealth; so much Ulysses all mankind
12372,ARGUMENT,"Excels in policy, and hath no peer."
12373,ARGUMENT,This information from Thesprotia's King
12374,ARGUMENT,"I gain'd, from Phidon; to myself he swore,"
12375,ARGUMENT,"Libation off'ring under his own roof,                            360"
12376,ARGUMENT,"That both the bark was launch'd, and the stout crew"
12377,ARGUMENT,"Prepared, that should conduct him to his home."
12378,ARGUMENT,"But me he first dismiss'd; for, as it chanced,"
12379,ARGUMENT,"A ship lay there of the Thesprotians, bound"
12380,ARGUMENT,To corn-enrich'd Dulichium. All the wealth
12381,ARGUMENT,"He shew'd me by the Chief amass'd, a store"
12382,ARGUMENT,To feed the house of yet another Prince
12383,ARGUMENT,To the tenth generation; so immense
12384,ARGUMENT,His treasures were within that palace lodg'd.
12385,ARGUMENT,"Himself he said was to Dodona gone,                              370"
12386,ARGUMENT,Counsel to ask from the oracular oaks
12387,ARGUMENT,"Sublime of Jove, how safest he might seek,"
12388,ARGUMENT,"After long exile thence, his native land,"
12389,ARGUMENT,"If openly were best, or in disguise."
12390,ARGUMENT,"Thus, therefore, he is safe, and at his home"
12391,ARGUMENT,"Well-nigh arrived, nor shall his country long"
12392,ARGUMENT,Want him. I swear it with a solemn oath.
12393,ARGUMENT,"First Jove be witness, King and Lord of all!"
12394,ARGUMENT,Next these domestic Gods of the renown'd
12395,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, in whose royal house I sit,                             380"
12396,ARGUMENT,That thou shalt see my saying all fulfill'd.
12397,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses shall this self-same year return,"
12398,ARGUMENT,"This self-same month, ere yet the next begin."
12399,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then Penelope discrete.
12400,ARGUMENT,"Grant heav'n, my guest, that this good word of thine"
12401,ARGUMENT,"Fail not! then, soon shalt thou such bounty share"
12402,ARGUMENT,"And friendship at my hands, that, at first sight,"
12403,ARGUMENT,Whoe'er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest.
12404,ARGUMENT,But ah! my soul forebodes how it will prove;
12405,ARGUMENT,"Neither Ulysses will return, nor thou                            390"
12406,ARGUMENT,Receive safe conduct hence; for we have here
12407,ARGUMENT,"None, such as once Ulysses was, to rule"
12408,ARGUMENT,"His household with authority, and to send"
12409,ARGUMENT,With honourable convoy to his home
12410,ARGUMENT,"The worthy guest, or to regale him here."
12411,ARGUMENT,"Give him the bath, my maidens; spread his couch"
12412,ARGUMENT,"With linen soft, with fleecy gaberdines[82]"
12413,ARGUMENT,"And rugs of splendid hue, that he may lie"
12414,ARGUMENT,"Waiting, well-warm'd, the golden morn's return."
12415,ARGUMENT,Attend him also at the peep of day                               400
12416,ARGUMENT,"With bath and unction, that, his seat resumed"
12417,ARGUMENT,"Here in the palace, he may be prepared"
12418,ARGUMENT,For breakfast with Telemachus; and woe
12419,ARGUMENT,To him who shall presume to incommode
12420,ARGUMENT,Or cause him pain; that man shall be cashier'd
12421,ARGUMENT,"Hence instant, burn his anger as it may."
12422,ARGUMENT,"For how, my honour'd inmate! shalt thou learn"
12423,ARGUMENT,That I in wisdom œconomic aught
12424,ARGUMENT,"Pass other women, if unbathed, unoiled,"
12425,ARGUMENT,"Ill-clad, thou sojourn here? man's life is short,                410"
12426,ARGUMENT,"Whoso is cruel, and to cruel arts"
12427,ARGUMENT,"Addict, on him all men, while yet he lives,"
12428,ARGUMENT,"Call plagues and curses down, and after death"
12429,ARGUMENT,Scorn and proverbial mock'ries hunt his name.
12430,ARGUMENT,"But men, humane themselves, and giv'n by choice"
12431,ARGUMENT,"To offices humane, from land to land"
12432,ARGUMENT,"Are rumour'd honourably by their guests,"
12433,ARGUMENT,And ev'ry tongue is busy in their praise.
12434,ARGUMENT,"Her answer'd then, Ulysses, ever-wise."
12435,ARGUMENT,Consort revered of Laertiades!                                   420
12436,ARGUMENT,Warm gaberdines and rugs of splendid hue
12437,ARGUMENT,"To me have odious been, since first the sight"
12438,ARGUMENT,"Of Crete's snow-mantled mountain-tops I lost,"
12439,ARGUMENT,Sweeping the billows with extended oars.
12440,ARGUMENT,"No; I will pass, as I am wont to pass"
12441,ARGUMENT,The sleepless night; for on a sordid couch
12442,ARGUMENT,"Outstretch'd, full many a night have I reposed"
12443,ARGUMENT,Till golden-charioted Aurora dawn'd.
12444,ARGUMENT,Nor me the foot-bath pleases more; my foot
12445,ARGUMENT,"Shall none of all thy ministring maidens touch,                  430"
12446,ARGUMENT,Unless there be some ancient matron grave
12447,ARGUMENT,"Among them, who hath pangs of heart endured"
12448,ARGUMENT,"Num'rous, and keen as I have felt myself;"
12449,ARGUMENT,Her I refuse not. She may touch my feet.
12450,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then prudent Penelope.
12451,ARGUMENT,Dear guest! for of all trav'llers here arrived
12452,ARGUMENT,"From distant regions, I have none received"
12453,ARGUMENT,"Discrete as thou, or whom I more have lov'd,"
12454,ARGUMENT,"So just thy matter is, and with such grace"
12455,ARGUMENT,"Express'd. I have an ancient maiden grave,                       440"
12456,ARGUMENT,The nurse who at my hapless husband's birth
12457,ARGUMENT,"Receiv'd him in her arms, and with kind care"
12458,ARGUMENT,"Maternal rear'd him; she shall wash thy feet,"
12459,ARGUMENT,"Although decrepid. Euryclea, rise!"
12460,ARGUMENT,Wash one coeval with thy Lord; for such
12461,ARGUMENT,"The feet and hands, it may be, are become"
12462,ARGUMENT,Of my Ulysses now; since man beset
12463,ARGUMENT,"With sorrow once, soon wrinkled grows and old."
12464,ARGUMENT,"She said, then Euryclea with both hands"
12465,ARGUMENT,"Cov'ring her face, in tepid tears profuse                        450"
12466,ARGUMENT,"Dissolved, and thus in mournful strains began."
12467,ARGUMENT,"Alas! my son, trouble for thy dear sake"
12468,ARGUMENT,Distracts me. Jove surely of all mankind
12469,ARGUMENT,"Thee hated most, though ever in thy heart"
12470,ARGUMENT,Devoutly giv'n; for never mortal man
12471,ARGUMENT,"So many thighs of fatted victims burn'd,"
12472,ARGUMENT,And chosen hecatombs produced as thou
12473,ARGUMENT,"To Jove the Thund'rer, him entreating still"
12474,ARGUMENT,"That he would grant thee a serene old age,"
12475,ARGUMENT,"And to instruct, thyself, thy glorious son.                      460"
12476,ARGUMENT,"Yet thus the God requites thee, cutting off"
12477,ARGUMENT,All hope of thy return--oh ancient sir!
12478,ARGUMENT,"Him too, perchance, where'er he sits a guest"
12479,ARGUMENT,"Beneath some foreign roof, the women taunt,"
12480,ARGUMENT,"As all these shameless ones have taunted thee,"
12481,ARGUMENT,Fearing whose mock'ry thou forbidd'st their hands
12482,ARGUMENT,"This office, which Icarius' daughter wise"
12483,ARGUMENT,"To me enjoins, and which I, glad perform."
12484,ARGUMENT,"Yes, I will wash thy feet; both for her sake"
12485,ARGUMENT,"And for thy own,--for sight of thee hath raised                  470"
12486,ARGUMENT,A tempest in my mind. Hear now the cause!
12487,ARGUMENT,"Full many a guest forlorn we entertain,"
12488,ARGUMENT,"But never any have I seen, whose size,"
12489,ARGUMENT,"The fashion of whose foot and pitch of voice,"
12490,ARGUMENT,"Such likeness of Ulysses show'd, as thine."
12491,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-shrewd, replied."
12492,ARGUMENT,"Such close similitude, O ancient dame!"
12493,ARGUMENT,"As thou observ'st between thy Lord and me,"
12494,ARGUMENT,"All, who have seen us both, have ever found."
12495,ARGUMENT,He said; then taking the resplendent vase                      480
12496,ARGUMENT,"Allotted always to that use, she first"
12497,ARGUMENT,"Infused cold water largely, then, the warm."
12498,ARGUMENT,Ulysses (for beside the hearth he sat)
12499,ARGUMENT,"Turn'd quick his face into the shade, alarm'd"
12500,ARGUMENT,"Lest, handling him, she should at once remark"
12501,ARGUMENT,"His scar, and all his stratagem unveil."
12502,ARGUMENT,"She then, approaching, minister'd the bath"
12503,ARGUMENT,"To her own King, and at first touch discern'd"
12504,ARGUMENT,"That token, by a bright-tusk'd boar of old"
12505,ARGUMENT,"Impress'd, what time he to Parnassus went                        490"
12506,ARGUMENT,"To visit there Autolycus and his sons,"
12507,ARGUMENT,"His mother's noble sire, who all mankind"
12508,ARGUMENT,In furtive arts and fraudful oaths excell'd.[83]
12509,ARGUMENT,For such endowments he by gift receiv'd
12510,ARGUMENT,"From Hermes' self, to whom the thighs of kids"
12511,ARGUMENT,"He offer'd and of lambs, and, in return,"
12512,ARGUMENT,The watchful Hermes never left his side.
12513,ARGUMENT,Autolycus arriving in the isle
12514,ARGUMENT,"Of pleasant Ithaca, the new-born son"
12515,ARGUMENT,"Of his own daughter found, whom on his knees                     500"
12516,ARGUMENT,"At close of supper Euryclea placed,"
12517,ARGUMENT,And thus the royal visitant address'd.
12518,ARGUMENT,"Thyself, Autolycus! devise a name"
12519,ARGUMENT,"For thy own daughter's son, by num'rous pray'rs"
12520,ARGUMENT,"Of thine and fervent, from the Gods obtained."
12521,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus Autolycus return'd.
12522,ARGUMENT,My daughter and my daughter's spouse! the name
12523,ARGUMENT,"Which I shall give your boy, that let him bear."
12524,ARGUMENT,Since after provocation and offence
12525,ARGUMENT,"To numbers giv'n of either sex, I come,                          510"
12526,ARGUMENT,"Call him Ulysses;[84] and when, grown mature,"
12527,ARGUMENT,"He shall Parnassus visit, the abode"
12528,ARGUMENT,"Magnificent in which his mother dwelt,"
12529,ARGUMENT,"And where my treasures lie, from my own stores"
12530,ARGUMENT,I will enrich and send him joyful home.
12531,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, therefore, that he might obtain"
12532,ARGUMENT,"Those princely gifts, went thither. Him arrived,"
12533,ARGUMENT,With right-hand gratulation and with words
12534,ARGUMENT,"Of welcome kind, Autolycus received,"
12535,ARGUMENT,Nor less his offspring; but the mother most                      520
12536,ARGUMENT,"Of his own mother clung around his neck,"
12537,ARGUMENT,Amphithea; she with many a fervent kiss
12538,ARGUMENT,"His forehead press'd, and his bright-beaming eyes."
12539,ARGUMENT,Then bade Autolycus his noble sons
12540,ARGUMENT,"Set forth a banquet. They, at his command,"
12541,ARGUMENT,"Led in a fatted ox of the fifth year,"
12542,ARGUMENT,"Which slaying first, they spread him carved abroad,"
12543,ARGUMENT,"Then scored his flesh, transfixed it with the spits,"
12544,ARGUMENT,And roasting all with culinary skill
12545,ARGUMENT,"Exact, gave each his portion. Thus they sat                      530"
12546,ARGUMENT,"Feasting all day, and till the sun declined,"
12547,ARGUMENT,"But when the sun declined, and darkness fell,"
12548,ARGUMENT,"Each sought his couch, and took the gift of sleep."
12549,ARGUMENT,"Then, soon as day-spring's daughter rosy-palm'd"
12550,ARGUMENT,"Aurora look'd abroad, forth went the hounds,"
12551,ARGUMENT,"And, with the hounds Ulysses, and the youths,"
12552,ARGUMENT,"Sons of Autolycus, to chase the boar."
12553,ARGUMENT,"Arrived at the Parnassian mount, they climb'd"
12554,ARGUMENT,"His bushy sides, and to his airy heights"
12555,ARGUMENT,Ere long attain'd. It was the pleasant hour                      540
12556,ARGUMENT,When from the gently-swelling flood profound
12557,ARGUMENT,"The sun, emerging, first smote on the fields."
12558,ARGUMENT,"The hunters reach'd the valley; foremost ran,"
12559,ARGUMENT,"Questing, the hounds; behind them, swift, the sons"
12560,ARGUMENT,"Came of Autolycus, with whom advanced"
12561,ARGUMENT,"The illustrious Prince Ulysses, pressing close"
12562,ARGUMENT,"The hounds, and brandishing his massy spear."
12563,ARGUMENT,"There, hid in thickest shades, lay an huge boar."
12564,ARGUMENT,That covert neither rough winds blowing moist
12565,ARGUMENT,"Could penetrate, nor could the noon-day sun                      550"
12566,ARGUMENT,"Smite through it, or fast-falling show'rs pervade,"
12567,ARGUMENT,"So thick it was, and underneath the ground"
12568,ARGUMENT,With litter of dry foliage strew'd profuse.
12569,ARGUMENT,"Hunters and dogs approaching him, his ear"
12570,ARGUMENT,The sound of feet perceived; upridging high
12571,ARGUMENT,"His bristly back and glaring fire, he sprang"
12572,ARGUMENT,"Forth from the shrubs, and in defiance stood"
12573,ARGUMENT,"Near and right opposite. Ulysses, first,"
12574,ARGUMENT,"Rush'd on him, elevating his long spear"
12575,ARGUMENT,"Ardent to wound him; but, preventing quick                       560"
12576,ARGUMENT,"His foe, the boar gash'd him above the knee."
12577,ARGUMENT,"Much flesh, assailing him oblique, he tore"
12578,ARGUMENT,"With his rude tusk, but to the Hero's bone"
12579,ARGUMENT,Pierced not; Ulysses _his_ right shoulder reach'd;
12580,ARGUMENT,And with a deadly thrust impell'd the point
12581,ARGUMENT,Of his bright spear through him and far beyond.
12582,ARGUMENT,"Loud yell'd the boar, sank in the dust, and died."
12583,ARGUMENT,"Around Ulysses, then, the busy sons"
12584,ARGUMENT,Throng'd of Autolycus; expert they braced
12585,ARGUMENT,"The wound of the illustrious hunter bold,                        570"
12586,ARGUMENT,"With incantation staunched the sable blood,"
12587,ARGUMENT,"And sought in haste their father's house again,"
12588,ARGUMENT,"Whence, heal'd and gratified with splendid gifts"
12589,ARGUMENT,"They sent him soon rejoicing to his home,"
12590,ARGUMENT,Themselves rejoicing also. Glad their son
12591,ARGUMENT,"His parents saw again, and of the scar"
12592,ARGUMENT,"Enquired, where giv'n, and how? He told them all,"
12593,ARGUMENT,"How to Parnassus with his friends he went,"
12594,ARGUMENT,"Sons of Autolycus to hunt, and how"
12595,ARGUMENT,A boar had gash'd him with his iv'ry tusk.                       580
12596,ARGUMENT,"That scar, while chafing him with open palms,"
12597,ARGUMENT,The matron knew; she left his foot to fall;
12598,ARGUMENT,Down dropp'd his leg into the vase; the brass
12599,ARGUMENT,"Rang, and o'ertilted by the sudden shock,"
12600,ARGUMENT,"Poured forth the water, flooding wide the floor."
12601,ARGUMENT,_Her_ spirit joy at once and sorrow seized;
12602,ARGUMENT,Tears fill'd her eyes; her intercepted voice
12603,ARGUMENT,Died in her throat; but to Ulysses' beard
12604,ARGUMENT,"Her hand advancing, thus, at length, she spake."
12605,ARGUMENT,"Thou art himself, Ulysses. Oh my son!                          590"
12606,ARGUMENT,"Dear to me, and my master as thou art,"
12607,ARGUMENT,"I knew thee not, till I had touch'd the scar."
12608,ARGUMENT,"She said, and to Penelope her eyes"
12609,ARGUMENT,"Directed, all impatient to declare"
12610,ARGUMENT,Her own Ulysses even then at home.
12611,ARGUMENT,"But she, nor eye nor ear for aught that pass'd"
12612,ARGUMENT,"Had then, her fixt attention so entire"
12613,ARGUMENT,"Minerva had engaged. Then, darting forth"
12614,ARGUMENT,"His arms, the Hero with his right-hand close"
12615,ARGUMENT,"Compress'd her throat, and nearer to himself                     600"
12616,ARGUMENT,"Drawing her with his left, thus caution'd her."
12617,ARGUMENT,Why would'st thou ruin me? Thou gav'st me milk
12618,ARGUMENT,Thyself from thy own breast. See me return'd
12619,ARGUMENT,"After long suff'rings, in the twentieth year,"
12620,ARGUMENT,To my own land. But since (some God the thought
12621,ARGUMENT,"Suggesting to thee) thou hast learn'd the truth,"
12622,ARGUMENT,Silence! lest others learn it from thy lips.
12623,ARGUMENT,"For this I say, nor shall the threat be vain;"
12624,ARGUMENT,If God vouchsafe to me to overcome
12625,ARGUMENT,"The haughty suitors, when I shall inflict                        610"
12626,ARGUMENT,"Death on the other women of my house,"
12627,ARGUMENT,"Although my nurse, thyself shalt also die."
12628,ARGUMENT,"Him answer'd Euryclea then, discrete."
12629,ARGUMENT,My son! oh how could so severe a word
12630,ARGUMENT,Escape thy lips? my fortitude of mind
12631,ARGUMENT,"Thou know'st, and even now shalt prove me firm"
12632,ARGUMENT,"As iron, secret as the stubborn rock."
12633,ARGUMENT,"But hear and mark me well. Should'st thou prevail,"
12634,ARGUMENT,"Assisted by a Pow'r divine, to slay"
12635,ARGUMENT,"The haughty suitors, I will then, myself,                        620"
12636,ARGUMENT,Give thee to know of all the female train
12637,ARGUMENT,"Who have dishonour'd thee, and who respect."
12638,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
12639,ARGUMENT,"My nurse, it were superfluous; spare thy tongue"
12640,ARGUMENT,That needless task. I can distinguish well
12641,ARGUMENT,"Myself, between them, and shall know them all;"
12642,ARGUMENT,But hold thy peace. Hush! leave it with the Gods.
12643,ARGUMENT,"So he; then went the ancient matron forth,"
12644,ARGUMENT,"That she might serve him with a second bath,"
12645,ARGUMENT,"For the whole first was spilt. Thus, laved at length,            630"
12646,ARGUMENT,"And smooth'd with oil, Ulysses nearer pull'd"
12647,ARGUMENT,His seat toward the glowing hearth to enjoy
12648,ARGUMENT,"More warmth, and drew his tatters o'er the scar."
12649,ARGUMENT,"Then, prudent, thus Penelope began."
12650,ARGUMENT,"One question, stranger, I shall yet propound,"
12651,ARGUMENT,"Though brief, for soon the hour of soft repose"
12652,ARGUMENT,"Grateful to all, and even to the sad"
12653,ARGUMENT,"Whom gentle sleep forsakes not, will arrive."
12654,ARGUMENT,But heav'n to me immeasurable woe
12655,ARGUMENT,"Assigns,--whose sole delight is to consume                       640"
12656,ARGUMENT,"My days in sighs, while here retired I sit,"
12657,ARGUMENT,Watching my maidens' labours and my own;
12658,ARGUMENT,"But (night return'd, and all to bed retired)"
12659,ARGUMENT,"I press mine also, yet with deep regret"
12660,ARGUMENT,"And anguish lacerated, even there."
12661,ARGUMENT,"As when at spring's first entrance, her sweet song"
12662,ARGUMENT,"The azure-crested nightingale renews,"
12663,ARGUMENT,Daughter of Pandarus; within the grove's
12664,ARGUMENT,"Thick foliage perch'd, she pours her echoing voice"
12665,ARGUMENT,"Now deep, now clear, still varying the strain                    650"
12666,ARGUMENT,"With which she mourns her Itylus, her son"
12667,ARGUMENT,"By royal Zethus, whom she, erring, slew,[85]"
12668,ARGUMENT,"So also I, by soul-distressing doubts"
12669,ARGUMENT,"Toss'd ever, muse if I shall here remain"
12670,ARGUMENT,"A faithful guardian of my son's affairs,"
12671,ARGUMENT,"My husband's bed respecting, and not less"
12672,ARGUMENT,"My own fair fame, or whether I shall him"
12673,ARGUMENT,Of all my suitors follow to his home
12674,ARGUMENT,"Who noblest seems, and offers richest dow'r."
12675,ARGUMENT,"My son while he was infant yet, and own'd                        660"
12676,ARGUMENT,"An infant's mind, could never give consent"
12677,ARGUMENT,"That I should wed and leave him; but at length,"
12678,ARGUMENT,"Since he hath reached the stature of a man,"
12679,ARGUMENT,"He wishes my departure hence, the waste"
12680,ARGUMENT,Viewing indignant by the suitors made.
12681,ARGUMENT,"But I have dream'd. Hear, and expound my dream."
12682,ARGUMENT,"My geese are twenty, which within my walls"
12683,ARGUMENT,I feed with sodden wheat; they serve to amuse
12684,ARGUMENT,Sometimes my sorrow. From the mountains came
12685,ARGUMENT,"An eagle, huge, hook-beak'd, brake all their necks,              670"
12686,ARGUMENT,And slew them; scatter'd on the palace-floor
12687,ARGUMENT,"They lay, and he soar'd swift into the skies."
12688,ARGUMENT,"Dream only as it was, I wept aloud,"
12689,ARGUMENT,"Till all my maidens, gather'd by my voice,"
12690,ARGUMENT,"Arriving, found me weeping still, and still"
12691,ARGUMENT,"Complaining, that the eagle had at once"
12692,ARGUMENT,"Slain all my geese. But, to the palace-roof"
12693,ARGUMENT,"Stooping again, he sat, and with a voice"
12694,ARGUMENT,"Of human sound, forbad my tears, and said--"
12695,ARGUMENT,Courage! O daughter of the far-renown'd                        680
12696,ARGUMENT,"Icarius! no vain dream thou hast beheld,"
12697,ARGUMENT,"But, in thy sleep, a truth. The slaughter'd geese"
12698,ARGUMENT,Denote thy suitors. I who have appear'd
12699,ARGUMENT,"An eagle in thy sight, am yet indeed"
12700,ARGUMENT,"Thy husband, who have now, at last, return'd,"
12701,ARGUMENT,"Death, horrid death designing for them all."
12702,ARGUMENT,"He said; then waking at the voice, I cast"
12703,ARGUMENT,"An anxious look around, and saw my geese"
12704,ARGUMENT,"Beside their tray, all feeding as before."
12705,ARGUMENT,"Her then Ulysses answer'd, ever-wise.                          690"
12706,ARGUMENT,O Queen! it is not possible to miss
12707,ARGUMENT,"Thy dream's plain import, since Ulysses' self"
12708,ARGUMENT,Hath told thee the event; thy suitors all
12709,ARGUMENT,Must perish; not one suitor shall escape.
12710,ARGUMENT,To whom Penelope discrete replied.
12711,ARGUMENT,"Dreams are inexplicable, O my guest!"
12712,ARGUMENT,And oft-times mere delusions that receive
12713,ARGUMENT,No just accomplishment. There are two gates
12714,ARGUMENT,Through which the fleeting phantoms pass; of horn
12715,ARGUMENT,"Is one, and one of ivory.[86] Such dreams                        700"
12716,ARGUMENT,As through the thin-leaf'd iv'ry portal come
12717,ARGUMENT,"Sooth, but perform not, utt'ring empty sounds;"
12718,ARGUMENT,"But such as through the polish'd horn escape,"
12719,ARGUMENT,"If, haply seen by any mortal eye,"
12720,ARGUMENT,"Prove faithful witnesses, and are fulfill'd."
12721,ARGUMENT,"But through those gates my wond'rous dream, I think,"
12722,ARGUMENT,Came not; thrice welcome were it else to me
12723,ARGUMENT,And to my son. Now mark my words; attend.
12724,ARGUMENT,This is the hated morn that from the house
12725,ARGUMENT,"Removes me of Ulysses. I shall fix,                              710"
12726,ARGUMENT,"This day, the rings for trial to them all"
12727,ARGUMENT,Of archership; Ulysses' custom was
12728,ARGUMENT,"To plant twelve spikes, all regular arranged[87]"
12729,ARGUMENT,"Like galley-props, and crested with a ring,"
12730,ARGUMENT,"Then standing far remote, true in his aim"
12731,ARGUMENT,He with his whizzing shaft would thrid them all.
12732,ARGUMENT,This is the contest in which now I mean
12733,ARGUMENT,"To prove the suitors; him, who with most ease"
12734,ARGUMENT,"Shall bend the bow, and shoot through all the rings,"
12735,ARGUMENT,"I follow, this dear mansion of my youth                          720"
12736,ARGUMENT,"Leaving, so fair, so fill'd with ev'ry good,"
12737,ARGUMENT,Though still to love it even in my dreams.
12738,ARGUMENT,"Her answer'd then Ulysses, ever-wise."
12739,ARGUMENT,Consort revered of Laertiades!
12740,ARGUMENT,"Postpone not this contention, but appoint"
12741,ARGUMENT,Forthwith the trial; for Ulysses here
12742,ARGUMENT,"Will sure arrive, ere they, (his polish'd bow"
12743,ARGUMENT,"Long tamp'ring) shall prevail to stretch the nerve,"
12744,ARGUMENT,And speed the arrow through the iron rings.
12745,ARGUMENT,To whom Penelope replied discrete.                             730
12746,ARGUMENT,"Would'st thou with thy sweet converse, O my guest!"
12747,ARGUMENT,"Here sooth me still, sleep ne'er should influence"
12748,ARGUMENT,These eyes the while; but always to resist
12749,ARGUMENT,"Sleep's pow'r is not for man, to whom the Gods"
12750,ARGUMENT,Each circumstance of his condition here
12751,ARGUMENT,Fix universally. Myself will seek
12752,ARGUMENT,"My own apartment at the palace-top,"
12753,ARGUMENT,"And there will lay me down on my sad couch,"
12754,ARGUMENT,"For such it hath been, and with tears of mine"
12755,ARGUMENT,"Ceaseless bedew'd, e'er since Ulysses went                       740"
12756,ARGUMENT,"To that bad city, never to be named."
12757,ARGUMENT,"There will I sleep; but sleep thou here below,"
12758,ARGUMENT,"Either, thyself, preparing on the ground"
12759,ARGUMENT,"Thy couch, or on a couch by these prepared."
12760,ARGUMENT,"So saying, she to her splendid chamber thence"
12761,ARGUMENT,"Retired, not sole, but by her female train"
12762,ARGUMENT,"Attended; there arrived, she wept her spouse,"
12763,ARGUMENT,"Her lov'd Ulysses, till Minerva dropp'd"
12764,ARGUMENT,The balm of slumber on her weary lids.

12805,ARGUMENT,"the present. He asks an omen from Jupiter, and that he would grant him"
12806,ARGUMENT,also to hear some propitious words from the lips of one in the family.
12807,ARGUMENT,His petitions are both answered. Preparation is made for the feast.

12912,ARGUMENT,"For sleep, when it hath once the eyelids veil'd,                 100"
12913,ARGUMENT,"All reminiscence blots of all alike,"
12914,ARGUMENT,Both good and ill; but me the Gods afflict
12915,ARGUMENT,"Not seldom ev'n in dreams, and at my side,"
12916,ARGUMENT,"This night again, one lay resembling him;"
12917,ARGUMENT,Such as my own Ulysses when he join'd
12918,ARGUMENT,Achaia's warriors; my exulting heart
12919,ARGUMENT,"No airy dream believed it, but a truth."
12920,ARGUMENT,"While thus she spake, in orient gold enthroned"
12921,ARGUMENT,"Came forth the morn; Ulysses, as she wept,"
12922,ARGUMENT,Heard plain her lamentation; him that sound                      110
12923,ARGUMENT,"Alarm'd; he thought her present, and himself"
12924,ARGUMENT,Known to her. Gath'ring hastily the cloak
12925,ARGUMENT,"His cov'ring, and the fleeces, them he placed"
12926,ARGUMENT,"Together on a throne within the hall,"
12927,ARGUMENT,But bore the bull's-hide forth into the air.
12928,ARGUMENT,"Then, lifting high his hands to Jove, he pray'd."
12929,ARGUMENT,Eternal Sire! if over moist and dry
12930,ARGUMENT,Ye have with good-will sped me to my home
12931,ARGUMENT,"After much suff'ring, grant me from the lips"
12932,ARGUMENT,"Of some domestic now awake, to hear                              120"
12933,ARGUMENT,"Words of propitious omen, and thyself"
12934,ARGUMENT,Vouchsafe me still some other sign abroad.
12935,ARGUMENT,"Such pray'r he made, and Jove omniscient heard."
12936,ARGUMENT,Sudden he thunder'd from the radiant heights
12937,ARGUMENT,"Olympian; glad, Ulysses heard the sound."
12938,ARGUMENT,"A woman, next, a labourer at the mill"
12939,ARGUMENT,"Hard by, where all the palace-mills were wrought,"
12940,ARGUMENT,Gave him the omen of propitious sound.
12941,ARGUMENT,"Twelve maidens, day by day, toil'd at the mills,"
12942,ARGUMENT,"Meal grinding, some, of barley, some, of wheat,                  130"
12943,ARGUMENT,Marrow of man.[90] The rest (their portion ground)
12944,ARGUMENT,All slept; she only from her task as yet
12945,ARGUMENT,"Ceas'd not, for she was feeblest of them all;"
12946,ARGUMENT,"She rested on her mill, and thus pronounced"
12947,ARGUMENT,The happy omen by her Lord desired.
12948,ARGUMENT,"Jove, Father, Governor of heav'n and earth!"
12949,ARGUMENT,Loud thou hast thunder'd from the starry skies
12950,ARGUMENT,"By no cloud veil'd; a sign propitious, giv'n"
12951,ARGUMENT,To whom I know not; but oh grant the pray'r
12952,ARGUMENT,Of a poor bond-woman! appoint their feast                        140
12953,ARGUMENT,"This day, the last that in Ulysses' house"
12954,ARGUMENT,"The suitors shall enjoy, for whom I drudge,"
12955,ARGUMENT,With aching heart and trembling knees their meal
12956,ARGUMENT,Grinding continual. Feast they here no more!
12957,ARGUMENT,"She ended, and the list'ning Chief received"
12958,ARGUMENT,With equal joy both signs; for well he hoped
12959,ARGUMENT,That he should punish soon those guilty men.
12960,ARGUMENT,And now the other maidens in the hall
12961,ARGUMENT,"Assembling, kindled on the hearth again"
12962,ARGUMENT,"Th' unwearied blaze; then, godlike from his couch                150"
12963,ARGUMENT,"Arose Telemachus, and, fresh-attired,"
12964,ARGUMENT,"Athwart his shoulders his bright faulchion slung,"
12965,ARGUMENT,"Bound his fair sandals to his feet, and took"
12966,ARGUMENT,His sturdy spear pointed with glitt'ring brass;
12967,ARGUMENT,"Advancing to the portal, there he stood,"
12968,ARGUMENT,"And Euryclea thus, his nurse, bespake."
12969,ARGUMENT,Nurse! have ye with respectful notice serv'd
12970,ARGUMENT,Our guest? or hath he found a sordid couch
12971,ARGUMENT,"E'en where he might? for, prudent though she be,"
12972,ARGUMENT,"My mother, inattentive oft, the worse                            160"
12973,ARGUMENT,"Treats kindly, and the better sends away."
12974,ARGUMENT,"Whom Euryclea answer'd, thus, discrete."
12975,ARGUMENT,"Blame not, my son! who merits not thy blame."
12976,ARGUMENT,"The guest sat drinking till he would no more,"
12977,ARGUMENT,"And ate, till, question'd, he replied--Enough."
12978,ARGUMENT,"But when the hour of sleep call'd him to rest,"
12979,ARGUMENT,She gave commandment to her female train
12980,ARGUMENT,"To spread his couch. Yet he, like one forlorn,"
12981,ARGUMENT,"And, through despair, indiff'rent to himself,"
12982,ARGUMENT,"Both bed and rugs refused, and in the porch                      170"
12983,ARGUMENT,On skins of sheep and on an undress'd hide
12984,ARGUMENT,"Reposed, where we threw cov'ring over him."
12985,ARGUMENT,"She ceas'd, and, grasping his bright-headed spear,"
12986,ARGUMENT,"Forth went the Prince attended, as he went,"
12987,ARGUMENT,By his fleet hounds; to the assembled Greeks
12988,ARGUMENT,"In council with majestic gait he moved,"
12989,ARGUMENT,"And Euryclea, daughter wise of Ops,"
12990,ARGUMENT,"Pisenor's son, call'd to the serving-maids."
12991,ARGUMENT,Haste ye! be diligent! sweep the palace-floor
12992,ARGUMENT,And sprinkle it; then give the sumptuous seats                   180
12993,ARGUMENT,Their purple coverings. Let others cleanse
12994,ARGUMENT,"With sponges all the tables, wash and rince"
12995,ARGUMENT,"The beakers well, and goblets rich-emboss'd;"
12996,ARGUMENT,"Run others to the fountain, and bring thence"
12997,ARGUMENT,Water with speed. The suitors will not long
12998,ARGUMENT,"Be absent, but will early come to-day,"
12999,ARGUMENT,For this day is a public festival.[91]
13000,ARGUMENT,"So she; whom all, obedient, heard; forth went"
13001,ARGUMENT,"Together, twenty to the crystal fount,"
13002,ARGUMENT,While in their sev'ral provinces the rest                        190
13003,ARGUMENT,Bestirr'd them brisk at home. Then enter'd all
13004,ARGUMENT,"The suitors, and began cleaving the wood."
13005,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, the women from the fountain came,"
13006,ARGUMENT,"Whom soon the swine-herd follow'd, driving three"
13007,ARGUMENT,His fattest brawns; them in the spacious court
13008,ARGUMENT,"He feeding left, and to Ulysses' side"
13009,ARGUMENT,"Approaching, courteously bespake the Chief."
13010,ARGUMENT,Guest! look the Greecians on thee with respect
13011,ARGUMENT,"At length, or still disdainful as before?"
13012,ARGUMENT,"Then, answer thus Ulysses wise return'd.                       200"
13013,ARGUMENT,Yes--and I would that vengeance from the Gods
13014,ARGUMENT,"Might pay their insolence, who in a house"
13015,ARGUMENT,"Not theirs, dominion exercise, and plan"
13016,ARGUMENT,"Unseemly projects, shameless as they are!"
13017,ARGUMENT,Thus they conferr'd; and now Melanthius came
13018,ARGUMENT,"The goat-herd, driving, with the aid of two"
13019,ARGUMENT,"His fellow-swains, the fattest of his goats"
13020,ARGUMENT,To feast the suitors. In the sounding porch
13021,ARGUMENT,"The goats he tied, then, drawing near, in terms"
13022,ARGUMENT,Reproachful thus assail'd Ulysses' ear.                          210
13023,ARGUMENT,"How, stranger? persever'st thou, begging, still"
13024,ARGUMENT,To vex the suitors? wilt thou not depart?
13025,ARGUMENT,"Scarce shall we settle this dispute, I judge,"
13026,ARGUMENT,Till we have tasted each the other's fist;
13027,ARGUMENT,Thou art unreasonable thus to beg
13028,ARGUMENT,Here always--have the Greeks no feasts beside?
13029,ARGUMENT,"He spake, to whom Ulysses answer none"
13030,ARGUMENT,"Return'd, but shook his brows, and, silent, framed"
13031,ARGUMENT,"Terrible purposes. Then, third, approach'd"
13032,ARGUMENT,"Chief o'er the herds, Philœtius; fatted goats                    220"
13033,ARGUMENT,"He for the suitors brought, with which he drove"
13034,ARGUMENT,"An heifer; (ferry-men had pass'd them o'er,"
13035,ARGUMENT,Carriers of all who on their coast arrive)
13036,ARGUMENT,"He tied them in the sounding porch, then stood"
13037,ARGUMENT,"Beside the swine-herd, to whom thus he said."
13038,ARGUMENT,"Who is this guest, Eumæus, here arrived"
13039,ARGUMENT,So lately? from what nation hath he come?
13040,ARGUMENT,What parentage and country boasts the man?
13041,ARGUMENT,"I pity him, whose figure seems to speak"
13042,ARGUMENT,Royalty in him. Heav'n will surely plunge                        230
13043,ARGUMENT,"The race of common wand'rers deep in woe,"
13044,ARGUMENT,If thus it destine even Kings to mourn.
13045,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd; and, with his right hand, drawing nigh,"
13046,ARGUMENT,"Welcom'd Ulysses, whom he thus bespake."
13047,ARGUMENT,Hail venerable guest! and be thy lot
13048,ARGUMENT,"Prosp'rous at least hereafter, who art held"
13049,ARGUMENT,At present in the bonds of num'rous ills.
13050,ARGUMENT,"Thou, Jupiter, of all the Gods, art most"
13051,ARGUMENT,"Severe, and spar'st not to inflict distress"
13052,ARGUMENT,Even on creatures from thyself derived.[92]                      240
13053,ARGUMENT,"I had no sooner mark'd thee, than my eyes"
13054,ARGUMENT,"Swam, and the sweat gush'd from me at the thought"
13055,ARGUMENT,Of dear Ulysses; for if yet he live
13056,ARGUMENT,"And see the sun, such tatters, I suppose,"
13057,ARGUMENT,"He wears, a wand'rer among human-kind."
13058,ARGUMENT,But if already with the dead he dwell
13059,ARGUMENT,"In Pluto's drear abode, oh then, alas"
13060,ARGUMENT,"For kind Ulysses! who consign'd to me,"
13061,ARGUMENT,"While yet a boy, his Cephalenian herds,"
13062,ARGUMENT,And they have now encreas'd to such a store                      250
13063,ARGUMENT,"Innumerable of broad-fronted beeves,"
13064,ARGUMENT,As only care like mine could have produced.
13065,ARGUMENT,"These, by command of others, I transport"
13066,ARGUMENT,"For their regale, who neither heed his son,"
13067,ARGUMENT,"Nor tremble at the anger of the Gods,"
13068,ARGUMENT,But long have wish'd ardently to divide
13069,ARGUMENT,And share the substance of our absent Lord.
13070,ARGUMENT,"Me, therefore, this thought occupies, and haunts"
13071,ARGUMENT,My mind not seldom; while the heir survives
13072,ARGUMENT,It were no small offence to drive his herds                      260
13073,ARGUMENT,"Afar, and migrate to a foreign land;"
13074,ARGUMENT,"Yet here to dwell, suff'ring oppressive wrongs"
13075,ARGUMENT,"While I attend another's beeves, appears"
13076,ARGUMENT,"Still less supportable; and I had fled,"
13077,ARGUMENT,And I had served some other mighty Chief
13078,ARGUMENT,"Long since, (for patience fails me to endure"
13079,ARGUMENT,My present lot) but that I cherish still
13080,ARGUMENT,"Some hope of my ill-fated Lord's return,"
13081,ARGUMENT,To rid his palace of those lawless guests.
13082,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.                           270"
13083,ARGUMENT,"Herdsman! since neither void of sense thou seem'st,"
13084,ARGUMENT,"Nor yet dishonest, but myself am sure"
13085,ARGUMENT,"That thou art owner of a mind discrete,"
13086,ARGUMENT,"Hear therefore, for I swear! bold I attest"
13087,ARGUMENT,"Jove and this hospitable board, and these"
13088,ARGUMENT,"The Lares[93] of the noble Chief, whose hearth"
13089,ARGUMENT,"Protects me now, that, ere thy going hence,"
13090,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses surely shall have reach'd his home,"
13091,ARGUMENT,"And thou shalt see him, if thou wilt, thyself,"
13092,ARGUMENT,Slaying the suitors who now lord it here.                        280
13093,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then the keeper of his beeves.
13094,ARGUMENT,Oh stranger! would but the Saturnian King
13095,ARGUMENT,"Perform that word, thou should'st be taught (thyself"
13096,ARGUMENT,Eye-witness of it) what an arm is mine.
13097,ARGUMENT,Eumæus also ev'ry power of heav'n
13098,ARGUMENT,"Entreated, that Ulysses might possess"
13099,ARGUMENT,His home again. Thus mutual they conferr'd.
13100,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, in conf'rence close the suitors plann'd"
13101,ARGUMENT,Death for Telemachus; but while they sat
13102,ARGUMENT,"Consulting, on their left the bird of Jove                       290"
13103,ARGUMENT,"An eagle soar'd, grasping a tim'rous dove."
13104,ARGUMENT,"Then, thus, Amphinomus the rest bespake."
13105,ARGUMENT,Oh friends! our consultation how to slay
13106,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, will never smoothly run"
13107,ARGUMENT,To its effect; but let us to the feast.
13108,ARGUMENT,"So spake Amphinomus, whose counsel pleased."
13109,ARGUMENT,"Then, all into the royal house repaired,"
13110,ARGUMENT,And on the thrones and couches throwing off
13111,ARGUMENT,"Their mantles, slew the fatted goats, the brawns,"
13112,ARGUMENT,"The sheep full-sized, and heifer of the herd.                    300"
13113,ARGUMENT,"The roasted entrails first they shared, then fill'd"
13114,ARGUMENT,"The beakers, and the swine-herd placed the cups,"
13115,ARGUMENT,"Philœtius, chief intendant of the beeves,"
13116,ARGUMENT,"Served all with baskets elegant of bread,"
13117,ARGUMENT,"While all their cups Melanthius charged with wine,"
13118,ARGUMENT,And they assail'd at once the ready feast.
13119,ARGUMENT,"Meantime Telemachus, with forecast shrewd,"
13120,ARGUMENT,"Fast by the marble threshold, but within"
13121,ARGUMENT,"The spacious hall his father placed, to whom"
13122,ARGUMENT,A sordid seat he gave and scanty board.                          310
13123,ARGUMENT,"A portion of the entrails, next, he set"
13124,ARGUMENT,"Before him, fill'd a golden goblet high,"
13125,ARGUMENT,"And thus, in presence of them all, began."
13126,ARGUMENT,"There seated now, drink as the suitors drink."
13127,ARGUMENT,"I will, myself, their biting taunts forbid,"
13128,ARGUMENT,"And violence. This edifice is mine,"
13129,ARGUMENT,Not public property; my father first
13130,ARGUMENT,"Possess'd it, and my right from him descends."
13131,ARGUMENT,"Suitors! controul your tongues, nor with your hands"
13132,ARGUMENT,"Offend, lest contest fierce and war ensue.                       320"
13133,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd: they gnawing, sat, their lips, aghast"
13134,ARGUMENT,With wonder that Telemachus in his speech
13135,ARGUMENT,"Such boldness used. Then spake Eupithes' son,"
13136,ARGUMENT,"Antinoüs, and the assembly thus address'd."
13137,ARGUMENT,"Let pass, ye Greeks! the language of the Prince,"
13138,ARGUMENT,"Harsh as it is, and big with threats to us."
13139,ARGUMENT,"Had Jove permitted, his orations here,"
13140,ARGUMENT,"Although thus eloquent, ere now had ceased."
13141,ARGUMENT,"So spake Antinoüs, whom Ulysses' son"
13142,ARGUMENT,Heard unconcern'd. And now the heralds came                      330
13143,ARGUMENT,"In solemn pomp, conducting through the streets"
13144,ARGUMENT,"A sacred hecatomb, when in the grove"
13145,ARGUMENT,"Umbrageous of Apollo, King shaft-arm'd,"
13146,ARGUMENT,The assembled Greecians met. The sav'ry roast
13147,ARGUMENT,"Finish'd, and from the spits withdrawn, each shared"
13148,ARGUMENT,"His portion of the noble feast, and such"
13149,ARGUMENT,As they enjoy'd themselves the attendants placed
13150,ARGUMENT,"Before Ulysses, for the Hero's son"
13151,ARGUMENT,"Himself, Telemachus, had so enjoined."
13152,ARGUMENT,But Pallas (that they might exasp'rate more                      340
13153,ARGUMENT,Ulysses) suffer'd not the suitor Chiefs
13154,ARGUMENT,"To banquet, guiltless of heart-piercing scoffs"
13155,ARGUMENT,Malign. There was a certain suitor named
13156,ARGUMENT,"Ctesippus, born in Samos; base of mind"
13157,ARGUMENT,"Was he and profligate, but, in the wealth"
13158,ARGUMENT,"Confiding of his father, woo'd the wife"
13159,ARGUMENT,Of long-exiled Ulysses. From his seat
13160,ARGUMENT,The haughty suitors thus that man address'd.
13161,ARGUMENT,"Ye noble suitors, I would speak; attend!"
13162,ARGUMENT,The guest is served; he hath already shared                      350
13163,ARGUMENT,Equal with us; nor less the laws demand
13164,ARGUMENT,Of hospitality; for neither just
13165,ARGUMENT,"It were nor decent, that a guest, received"
13166,ARGUMENT,"Here by Telemachus, should be denied"
13167,ARGUMENT,His portion of the feast. Come then--myself
13168,ARGUMENT,"Will give to him, that he may also give"
13169,ARGUMENT,"To her who laved him in the bath, or else"
13170,ARGUMENT,To whatsoever menial here he will.
13171,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he from a basket near at hand"
13172,ARGUMENT,"Heav'd an ox-foot, and with a vig'rous arm                       360"
13173,ARGUMENT,"Hurl'd it. Ulysses gently bow'd his head,"
13174,ARGUMENT,"Shunning the blow, but gratified his just"
13175,ARGUMENT,Resentment with a broad sardonic smile[94]
13176,ARGUMENT,Of dread significance. He smote the wall.
13177,ARGUMENT,Then thus Telemachus rebuked the deed.
13178,ARGUMENT,"Ctesippus, thou art fortunate; the bone"
13179,ARGUMENT,"Struck not the stranger, for he shunn'd the blow;"
13180,ARGUMENT,"Else, I had surely thrust my glitt'ring lance"
13181,ARGUMENT,"Right through thee; then, no hymenæal rites"
13182,ARGUMENT,"Of thine should have employ'd thy father here,                   370"
13183,ARGUMENT,But thy funereal. No man therefore treat
13184,ARGUMENT,"Me with indignity within these walls,"
13185,ARGUMENT,"For though of late a child, I can discern"
13186,ARGUMENT,"Now, and distinguish between good and ill."
13187,ARGUMENT,Suffice it that we patiently endure
13188,ARGUMENT,To be spectators daily of our sheep
13189,ARGUMENT,"Slaughter'd, our bread consumed, our stores of wine"
13190,ARGUMENT,Wasted; for what can one to all opposed?
13191,ARGUMENT,Come then--persist no longer in offence
13192,ARGUMENT,And hostile hate of me; or if ye wish                            380
13193,ARGUMENT,"To slay me, pause not. It were better far"
13194,ARGUMENT,"To die, and I had rather much be slain,"
13195,ARGUMENT,Than thus to witness your atrocious deeds
13196,ARGUMENT,"Day after day; to see our guests abused,"
13197,ARGUMENT,"With blows insulted, and the women dragg'd"
13198,ARGUMENT,With a licentious violence obscene
13199,ARGUMENT,From side to side of all this fair abode.
13200,ARGUMENT,"He said, and all sat silent, till at length"
13201,ARGUMENT,"Thus Agelaüs spake, Diastor's son."
13202,ARGUMENT,My friends! let none with contradiction thwart                 390
13203,ARGUMENT,"And rude reply, words rational and just;"
13204,ARGUMENT,"Assault no more the stranger, nor of all"
13205,ARGUMENT,The servants of renown'd Ulysses here
13206,ARGUMENT,"Harm any. My advice, both to the Queen"
13207,ARGUMENT,"And to Telemachus, shall gentle be,"
13208,ARGUMENT,May it but please them. While the hope survived
13209,ARGUMENT,Within your bosoms of the safe return
13210,ARGUMENT,"Of wise Ulysses to his native isle,"
13211,ARGUMENT,So long good reason was that she should use
13212,ARGUMENT,"Delay, and hold our wooing in suspence;                          400"
13213,ARGUMENT,"For had Ulysses come, that course had proved"
13214,ARGUMENT,Wisest and best; but that he comes no more
13215,ARGUMENT,"Appears, now, manifest. Thou, therefore, Prince!"
13216,ARGUMENT,"Seeking thy mother, counsel her to wed"
13217,ARGUMENT,"The noblest, and who offers richest dow'r,"
13218,ARGUMENT,"That thou, for thy peculiar, may'st enjoy"
13219,ARGUMENT,"Thy own inheritance in peace and ease,"
13220,ARGUMENT,"And she, departing, find another home."
13221,ARGUMENT,"To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied."
13222,ARGUMENT,"I swear by Jove, and by my father's woes,                        410"
13223,ARGUMENT,"Who either hath deceased far from his home,"
13224,ARGUMENT,"Or lives a wand'rer, that I interpose"
13225,ARGUMENT,No hindrance to her nuptials. Let her wed
13226,ARGUMENT,"Who offers most, and even whom she will."
13227,ARGUMENT,But to dismiss her rudely were a deed
13228,ARGUMENT,Unfilial--That I dare not--God forbid!
13229,ARGUMENT,So spake Telemachus. Then Pallas struck
13230,ARGUMENT,The suitors with delirium; wide they stretch'd
13231,ARGUMENT,Their jaws with unspontaneous laughter loud;
13232,ARGUMENT,"Their meat dripp'd blood; tears fill'd their eyes, and dire"
13233,ARGUMENT,"Presages of approaching woe, their hearts.                       421"
13234,ARGUMENT,Then thus the prophet Theoclymenus.[95]
13235,ARGUMENT,Ah miserable men! what curse is this
13236,ARGUMENT,That takes you now? night wraps itself around
13237,ARGUMENT,"Your faces, bodies, limbs; the palace shakes"
13238,ARGUMENT,"With peals of groans--and oh, what floods ye weep!"
13239,ARGUMENT,I see the walls and arches dappled thick
13240,ARGUMENT,"With gore; the vestibule is throng'd, the court"
13241,ARGUMENT,On all sides throng'd with apparitions grim
13242,ARGUMENT,Of slaughter'd men sinking into the gloom                        430
13243,ARGUMENT,Of Erebus; the sun is blotted out
13244,ARGUMENT,"From heav'n, and midnight whelms you premature."
13245,ARGUMENT,"He said, they, hearing, laugh'd; and thus the son"
13246,ARGUMENT,"Of Polybus, Eurymachus replied."
13247,ARGUMENT,This wand'rer from a distant shore hath left
13248,ARGUMENT,His wits behind. Hoa there! conduct him hence
13249,ARGUMENT,Into the forum; since he dreams it night
13250,ARGUMENT,"Already, teach him there that it is day."
13251,ARGUMENT,Then answer'd godlike Theoclymenus.
13252,ARGUMENT,"I have no need, Eurymachus, of guides                            440"
13253,ARGUMENT,"To lead me hence, for I have eyes and ears,"
13254,ARGUMENT,"The use of both my feet, and of a mind"
13255,ARGUMENT,In no respect irrational or wild.
13256,ARGUMENT,"These shall conduct me forth, for well I know"
13257,ARGUMENT,"That evil threatens you, such, too, as none"
13258,ARGUMENT,"Shall 'scape of all the suitors, whose delight"
13259,ARGUMENT,Is to insult the unoffending guest
13260,ARGUMENT,Received beneath this hospitable roof.
13261,ARGUMENT,"He said, and, issuing from the palace, sought"
13262,ARGUMENT,"Piræus' house, who gladly welcom'd him.                          450"
13263,ARGUMENT,Then all the suitors on each other cast
13264,ARGUMENT,"A look significant, and, to provoke"
13265,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus the more, fleer'd at his guests."
13266,ARGUMENT,"Of whom a youth thus, insolent began."
13267,ARGUMENT,"No living wight, Telemachus, had e'er"
13268,ARGUMENT,"Guests such as thine. Witness, we know not who,"
13269,ARGUMENT,"This hungry vagabond, whose means of life"
13270,ARGUMENT,"Are none, and who hath neither skill nor force"
13271,ARGUMENT,"To earn them, a mere burthen on the ground."
13272,ARGUMENT,"Witness the other also, who upstarts                             460"
13273,ARGUMENT,A prophet suddenly. Take my advice;
13274,ARGUMENT,I counsel wisely; send them both on board
13275,ARGUMENT,Some gallant bark to Sicily for sale;
13276,ARGUMENT,Thus shall they somewhat profit thee at last.
13277,ARGUMENT,"So spake the suitors, whom Telemachus"
13278,ARGUMENT,"Heard unconcern'd, and, silent, look'd and look'd"
13279,ARGUMENT,"Toward his father, watching still the time"
13280,ARGUMENT,When he should punish that licentious throng.
13281,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, Icarius' daughter, who had placed"
13282,ARGUMENT,"Her splendid seat opposite, heard distinct                       470"
13283,ARGUMENT,"Their taunting speeches. They, with noisy mirth,"
13284,ARGUMENT,"Feasted deliciously, for they had slain"
13285,ARGUMENT,Many a fat victim; but a sadder feast
13286,ARGUMENT,"Than, soon, the Goddess and the warrior Chief"
13287,ARGUMENT,"Should furnish for them, none shall ever share."
13288,ARGUMENT,Of which their crimes had furnish'd first the cause.

13316,ARGUMENT,
13317,ARGUMENT,"Penelope proposes to the suitors a contest with the bow, herself the"
13318,ARGUMENT,prize. They prove unable to bend the bow; when Ulysses having with some
13319,ARGUMENT,"difficulty possessed himself of it, manages it with the utmost ease, and"
13320,ARGUMENT,dispatches his arrow through twelve rings erected for the trial.
13321,ARGUMENT,
13322,ARGUMENT,
13323,ARGUMENT,"Minerva, now, Goddess cærulean-eyed,"
13324,ARGUMENT,"Prompted Icarius' daughter, the discrete"
13325,ARGUMENT,"Penelope, with bow and rings to prove"
13326,ARGUMENT,"Her suitors in Ulysses' courts, a game"
13327,ARGUMENT,Terrible in conclusion to them all.
13328,ARGUMENT,"First, taking in her hand the brazen key"
13329,ARGUMENT,"Well-forged, and fitted with an iv'ry grasp,"
13330,ARGUMENT,Attended by the women of her train
13331,ARGUMENT,"She sought her inmost chamber, the recess"
13332,ARGUMENT,"In which she kept the treasures of her Lord,                      10"
13333,ARGUMENT,"His brass, his gold, and steel elaborate."
13334,ARGUMENT,"Here lay his stubborn bow, and quiver fill'd"
13335,ARGUMENT,"With num'rous shafts, a fatal store. That bow"
13336,ARGUMENT,He had received and quiver from the hand
13337,ARGUMENT,"Of godlike Iphitus Eurytides,"
13338,ARGUMENT,"Whom, in Messenia,[96] in the house he met"
13339,ARGUMENT,Of brave Orsilochus. Ulysses came
13340,ARGUMENT,Demanding payment of arrearage due
13341,ARGUMENT,From all that land; for a Messenian fleet
13342,ARGUMENT,"Had borne from Ithaca three hundred sheep,                        20"
13343,ARGUMENT,"With all their shepherds; for which cause, ere yet"
13344,ARGUMENT,"Adult, he voyaged to that distant shore,"
13345,ARGUMENT,"Deputed by his sire, and by the Chiefs"
13346,ARGUMENT,"Of Ithaca, to make the just demand."
13347,ARGUMENT,But Iphitus had thither come to seek
13348,ARGUMENT,"Twelve mares and twelve mule colts which he had lost,"
13349,ARGUMENT,A search that cost him soon a bloody death.
13350,ARGUMENT,"For, coming to the house of Hercules"
13351,ARGUMENT,"The valiant task-performing son of Jove,"
13352,ARGUMENT,"He perish'd there, slain by his cruel host                        30"
13353,ARGUMENT,"Who, heedless of heav'n's wrath, and of the rights"
13354,ARGUMENT,"Of his own board, first fed, then slaughter'd him;"
13355,ARGUMENT,For in _his_ house the mares and colts were hidden.
13356,ARGUMENT,"He, therefore, occupied in that concern,"
13357,ARGUMENT,"Meeting Ulysses there, gave him the bow"
13358,ARGUMENT,"Which, erst, huge Eurytus had borne, and which"
13359,ARGUMENT,Himself had from his dying sire received.
13360,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, in return, on him bestowed"
13361,ARGUMENT,"A spear and sword, pledges of future love"
13362,ARGUMENT,And hospitality; but never more                                   40
13363,ARGUMENT,"They met each other at the friendly board,"
13364,ARGUMENT,"For, ere that hour arrived, the son of Jove"
13365,ARGUMENT,"Slew his own guest, the godlike Iphitus."
13366,ARGUMENT,"Thus came the bow into Ulysses' hands,"
13367,ARGUMENT,"Which, never in his gallant barks he bore"
13368,ARGUMENT,"To battle with him, (though he used it oft"
13369,ARGUMENT,In times of peace) but left it safely stored
13370,ARGUMENT,"At home, a dear memorial of his friend."
13371,ARGUMENT,"Soon as, divinest of her sex, arrived"
13372,ARGUMENT,"At that same chamber, with her foot she press'd                   50"
13373,ARGUMENT,"The oaken threshold bright, on which the hand"
13374,ARGUMENT,"Of no mean architect had stretch'd the line,"
13375,ARGUMENT,Who had erected also on each side
13376,ARGUMENT,"The posts on which the splendid portals hung,"
13377,ARGUMENT,"She loos'd the ring and brace, then introduced"
13378,ARGUMENT,"The key, and aiming at them from without,[97]"
13379,ARGUMENT,"Struck back the bolts. The portals, at that stroke,"
13380,ARGUMENT,"Sent forth a tone deep as the pastur'd bull's,"
13381,ARGUMENT,"And flew wide open. She, ascending, next,"
13382,ARGUMENT,The elevated floor on which the chests                            60
13383,ARGUMENT,"That held her own fragrant apparel stood,"
13384,ARGUMENT,With lifted hand aloft took down the bow
13385,ARGUMENT,In its embroider'd bow-case safe enclosed.
13386,ARGUMENT,"Then, sitting there, she lay'd it on her knees,"
13387,ARGUMENT,"Weeping aloud, and drew it from the case."
13388,ARGUMENT,"Thus weeping over it long time she sat,"
13389,ARGUMENT,"Till satiate, at the last, with grief and tears,"
13390,ARGUMENT,Descending by the palace steps she sought
13391,ARGUMENT,"Again the haughty suitors, with the bow"
13392,ARGUMENT,"Elastic, and the quiver in her hand                               70"
13393,ARGUMENT,"Replete with pointed shafts, a deadly store."
13394,ARGUMENT,"Her maidens, as she went, bore after her"
13395,ARGUMENT,"A coffer fill'd with prizes by her Lord,"
13396,ARGUMENT,"Much brass and steel; and when at length she came,"
13397,ARGUMENT,"Loveliest of women, where the suitors sat,"
13398,ARGUMENT,Between the pillars of the stately dome
13399,ARGUMENT,"Pausing, before her beauteous face she held"
13400,ARGUMENT,"Her lucid veil, and by two matrons chaste"
13401,ARGUMENT,"Supported, the assembly thus address'd."
13402,ARGUMENT,"Ye noble suitors hear, who rudely haunt                         80"
13403,ARGUMENT,"This palace of a Chief long absent hence,"
13404,ARGUMENT,"Whose substance ye have now long time consumed,"
13405,ARGUMENT,"Nor palliative have yet contrived, or could,"
13406,ARGUMENT,Save your ambition to make me a bride--
13407,ARGUMENT,Attend this game to which I call you forth.
13408,ARGUMENT,Now suitors! prove yourselves with this huge bow
13409,ARGUMENT,Of wide-renown'd Ulysses; he who draws
13410,ARGUMENT,"Easiest the bow, and who his arrow sends"
13411,ARGUMENT,"Through twice six rings, he takes me to his home,"
13412,ARGUMENT,And I must leave this mansion of my youth                         90
13413,ARGUMENT,"Plenteous, magnificent, which, doubtless, oft"
13414,ARGUMENT,I shall remember even in my dreams.
13415,ARGUMENT,"So saying, she bade Eumæus lay the bow"
13416,ARGUMENT,"Before them, and the twice six rings of steel."
13417,ARGUMENT,"He wept, received them, and obey'd; nor wept"
13418,ARGUMENT,"The herdsman less, seeing the bow which erst"
13419,ARGUMENT,His Lord had occupied; when at their tears
13420,ARGUMENT,"Indignant, thus, Antinoüs began."
13421,ARGUMENT,"Ye rural drones, whose purblind eyes see not"
13422,ARGUMENT,"Beyond the present hour, egregious fools!                        100"
13423,ARGUMENT,"Why weeping trouble ye the Queen, too much"
13424,ARGUMENT,Before afflicted for her husband lost?
13425,ARGUMENT,"Either partake the banquet silently,"
13426,ARGUMENT,"Or else go weep abroad, leaving the bow,"
13427,ARGUMENT,"That stubborn test, to us; for none, I judge,"
13428,ARGUMENT,"None here shall bend this polish'd bow with ease,"
13429,ARGUMENT,Since in this whole assembly I discern
13430,ARGUMENT,"None like Ulysses, whom myself have seen"
13431,ARGUMENT,"And recollect, though I was then a boy."
13432,ARGUMENT,"He said, but in his heart, meantime, the hope                  110"
13433,ARGUMENT,"Cherish'd, that he should bend, himself, the bow,"
13434,ARGUMENT,And pass the rings; yet was he destin'd first
13435,ARGUMENT,Of all that company to taste the steel
13436,ARGUMENT,"Of brave Ulysses' shaft, whom in that house"
13437,ARGUMENT,"He had so oft dishonour'd, and had urged"
13438,ARGUMENT,So oft all others to the like offence.
13439,ARGUMENT,"Amidst them, then, the sacred might arose"
13440,ARGUMENT,"Of young Telemachus, who thus began."
13441,ARGUMENT,Saturnian Jove questionless hath deprived
13442,ARGUMENT,"Me of all reason. My own mother, fam'd                           120"
13443,ARGUMENT,"For wisdom as she is, makes known to all"
13444,ARGUMENT,Her purpose to abandon this abode
13445,ARGUMENT,"And follow a new mate, while, heedless, I"
13446,ARGUMENT,Trifle and laugh as I were still a child.
13447,ARGUMENT,"But come, ye suitors! since the prize is such,"
13448,ARGUMENT,A woman like to whom none can be found
13449,ARGUMENT,This day in all Achaia; on the shores
13450,ARGUMENT,Of sacred Pylus; in the cities proud
13451,ARGUMENT,Of Argos or Mycenæ; or even here
13452,ARGUMENT,In Ithaca; or yet within the walls                               130
13453,ARGUMENT,Of black Epirus; and since this yourselves
13454,ARGUMENT,"Know also, wherefore should I speak her praise?"
13455,ARGUMENT,"Come then, delay not, waste not time in vain"
13456,ARGUMENT,"Excuses, turn not from the proof, but bend"
13457,ARGUMENT,"The bow, that thus the issue may be known."
13458,ARGUMENT,"I also will, myself, that task essay;"
13459,ARGUMENT,"And should I bend the bow, and pass the rings,"
13460,ARGUMENT,Then shall not my illustrious mother leave
13461,ARGUMENT,"Her son forlorn, forsaking this abode"
13462,ARGUMENT,"To follow a new spouse, while I remain                           140"
13463,ARGUMENT,"Disconsolate, although of age to bear,"
13464,ARGUMENT,"Successful as my sire, the prize away."
13465,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he started from his seat, cast off"
13466,ARGUMENT,"His purple cloak, and lay'd his sword aside,"
13467,ARGUMENT,"Then fix'd, himself, the rings, furrowing the earth"
13468,ARGUMENT,"By line, and op'ning one long trench for all,"
13469,ARGUMENT,And stamping close the glebe. Amazement seized
13470,ARGUMENT,"All present, seeing with how prompt a skill"
13471,ARGUMENT,"He executed, though untaught, his task."
13472,ARGUMENT,"Then, hasting to the portal, there he stood.                     150"
13473,ARGUMENT,"Thrice, struggling, he essay'd to bend the bow,"
13474,ARGUMENT,"And thrice desisted, hoping still to draw"
13475,ARGUMENT,"The bow-string home, and shoot through all the rings.[98]"
13476,ARGUMENT,And now the fourth time striving with full force
13477,ARGUMENT,"He had prevail'd to string it, but his sire"
13478,ARGUMENT,Forbad his eager efforts by a sign.
13479,ARGUMENT,Then thus the royal youth to all around--
13480,ARGUMENT,Gods! either I shall prove of little force
13481,ARGUMENT,"Hereafter, and for manly feats unapt,"
13482,ARGUMENT,"Or I am yet too young, and have not strength                     160"
13483,ARGUMENT,To quell the aggressor's contumely. But come--
13484,ARGUMENT,(For ye have strength surpassing mine) try ye
13485,ARGUMENT,"The bow, and bring this contest to an end."
13486,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd, and set the bow down on the floor,"
13487,ARGUMENT,Reclining it against the shaven pannels smooth
13488,ARGUMENT,"That lined the wall; the arrow next he placed,"
13489,ARGUMENT,"Leaning against the bow's bright-polish'd horn,"
13490,ARGUMENT,"And to the seat, whence he had ris'n, return'd."
13491,ARGUMENT,"Then thus Eupithes' son, Antinoüs spake."
13492,ARGUMENT,"My friends! come forth successive from the right,[99]          170"
13493,ARGUMENT,Where he who ministers the cup begins.
13494,ARGUMENT,"So spake Antinoüs, and his counsel pleased."
13495,ARGUMENT,"Then, first, Leiodes, Œnop's son, arose."
13496,ARGUMENT,"He was their soothsayer, and ever sat"
13497,ARGUMENT,"Beside the beaker, inmost of them all."
13498,ARGUMENT,"To him alone, of all, licentious deeds"
13499,ARGUMENT,"Were odious, and, with indignation fired,"
13500,ARGUMENT,He witness'd the excesses of the rest.
13501,ARGUMENT,"He then took foremost up the shaft and bow,"
13502,ARGUMENT,"And, station'd at the portal, strove to bend                     180"
13503,ARGUMENT,"But bent it not, fatiguing, first, his hands"
13504,ARGUMENT,Delicate and uncustom'd to the toil.
13505,ARGUMENT,"He ceased, and the assembly thus bespake."
13506,ARGUMENT,"My friends, I speed not; let another try;"
13507,ARGUMENT,For many Princes shall this bow of life
13508,ARGUMENT,"Bereave, since death more eligible seems,"
13509,ARGUMENT,"Far more, than loss of her, for whom we meet"
13510,ARGUMENT,"Continual here, expecting still the prize."
13511,ARGUMENT,"Some suitor, haply, at this moment, hopes"
13512,ARGUMENT,"That he shall wed whom long he hath desired,                     190"
13513,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses' wife, Penelope; let him"
13514,ARGUMENT,"Essay the bow, and, trial made, address"
13515,ARGUMENT,His spousal offers to some other fair
13516,ARGUMENT,"Among the long-stoled Princesses of Greece,"
13517,ARGUMENT,"This Princess leaving his, whose proffer'd gifts"
13518,ARGUMENT,"Shall please her most, and whom the Fates ordain."
13519,ARGUMENT,"He said, and set the bow down on the floor,"
13520,ARGUMENT,Reclining it against the shaven pannels smooth
13521,ARGUMENT,"That lined the wall; the arrow, next, he placed,"
13522,ARGUMENT,"Leaning against the bow's bright-polish'd horn,                  200"
13523,ARGUMENT,And to the seat whence he had ris'n return'd.
13524,ARGUMENT,"Then him Antinoüs, angry, thus reproved."
13525,ARGUMENT,"What word, Leiodes, grating to our ears"
13526,ARGUMENT,Hath scap'd thy lips? I hear it with disdain.
13527,ARGUMENT,"Shall this bow fatal prove to many a Prince,"
13528,ARGUMENT,"Because thou hast, thyself, too feeble proved"
13529,ARGUMENT,To bend it? no. Thou wast not born to bend
13530,ARGUMENT,"The unpliant bow, or to direct the shaft,"
13531,ARGUMENT,But here are nobler who shall soon prevail.
13532,ARGUMENT,"He said, and to Melanthius gave command,                       210"
13533,ARGUMENT,"The goat-herd. Hence, Melanthius, kindle fire;"
13534,ARGUMENT,"Beside it place, with fleeces spread, a form"
13535,ARGUMENT,Of length commodious; from within procure
13536,ARGUMENT,"A large round cake of suet next, with which"
13537,ARGUMENT,When we have chafed and suppled the tough bow
13538,ARGUMENT,"Before the fire, we will again essay"
13539,ARGUMENT,"To bend it, and decide the doubtful strife."
13540,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and Melanthius, kindling fire"
13541,ARGUMENT,"Beside it placed, with fleeces spread, a form"
13542,ARGUMENT,"Of length commodious; next, he brought a cake                    220"
13543,ARGUMENT,"Ample and round of suet from within,"
13544,ARGUMENT,"With which they chafed the bow, then tried again"
13545,ARGUMENT,"To bend, but bent it not; superior strength"
13546,ARGUMENT,"To theirs that task required. Yet two, the rest"
13547,ARGUMENT,"In force surpassing, made no trial yet,"
13548,ARGUMENT,"Antinoüs, and Eurymachus the brave."
13549,ARGUMENT,Then went the herdsman and the swine-herd forth
13550,ARGUMENT,"Together; after whom, the glorious Chief"
13551,ARGUMENT,"Himself the house left also, and when all"
13552,ARGUMENT,"Without the court had met, with gentle speech                    230"
13553,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, then, the faithful pair address'd."
13554,ARGUMENT,"Herdsman! and thou, Eumæus! shall I keep"
13555,ARGUMENT,"A certain secret close, or shall I speak"
13556,ARGUMENT,"Outright? my spirit prompts me, and I will."
13557,ARGUMENT,What welcome should Ulysses at your hands
13558,ARGUMENT,"Receive, arriving suddenly at home,"
13559,ARGUMENT,"Some God his guide; would ye the suitors aid,"
13560,ARGUMENT,Or would ye aid Ulysses? answer true.
13561,ARGUMENT,Then thus the chief intendant of his herds.
13562,ARGUMENT,"Would Jove but grant me my desire, to see                        240"
13563,ARGUMENT,"Once more the Hero, and would some kind Pow'r,"
13564,ARGUMENT,"Restore him, I would shew thee soon an arm"
13565,ARGUMENT,"Strenuous to serve him, and a dauntless heart."
13566,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus, also, fervently implored"
13567,ARGUMENT,"The Gods in pray'r, that they would render back"
13568,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses to his home. He, then, convinced"
13569,ARGUMENT,"Of their unfeigning honesty, began."
13570,ARGUMENT,"Behold him! I am he myself, arrived"
13571,ARGUMENT,After long suff'rings in the twentieth year!
13572,ARGUMENT,I know how welcome to yourselves alone                           250
13573,ARGUMENT,"Of all my train I come, for I have heard"
13574,ARGUMENT,None others praying for my safe return.
13575,ARGUMENT,I therefore tell you truth; should heav'n subdue
13576,ARGUMENT,"The suitors under me, ye shall receive"
13577,ARGUMENT,"Each at my hands a bride, with lands and house"
13578,ARGUMENT,"Near to my own, and ye shall be thenceforth"
13579,ARGUMENT,Dear friends and brothers of the Prince my son.
13580,ARGUMENT,Lo! also this indisputable proof
13581,ARGUMENT,That ye may know and trust me. View it here.
13582,ARGUMENT,It is the scar which in Parnassus erst                           260
13583,ARGUMENT,(Where with the sons I hunted of renown'd
13584,ARGUMENT,Autolycus) I from a boar received.
13585,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he stripp'd his tatters, and unveil'd"
13586,ARGUMENT,"The whole broad scar; then, soon as they had seen"
13587,ARGUMENT,"And surely recognized the mark, each cast"
13588,ARGUMENT,"His arms around Ulysses, wept, embraced"
13589,ARGUMENT,"And press'd him to his bosom, kissing oft"
13590,ARGUMENT,"His brows and shoulders, who as oft their hands"
13591,ARGUMENT,"And foreheads kiss'd, nor had the setting sun"
13592,ARGUMENT,"Beheld them satisfied, but that himself                          270"
13593,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses thus admonished them, and said."
13594,ARGUMENT,"Cease now from tears, lest any, coming forth,"
13595,ARGUMENT,Mark and report them to our foes within.
13596,ARGUMENT,"Now, to the hall again, but one by one,"
13597,ARGUMENT,"Not all at once, I foremost, then yourselves,"
13598,ARGUMENT,And this shall be the sign. Full well I know
13599,ARGUMENT,"That, all unanimous, they will oppose"
13600,ARGUMENT,Deliv'ry of the bow and shafts to me;
13601,ARGUMENT,"But thou, (proceeding with it to my seat)"
13602,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus, noble friend! shalt give the bow                         280"
13603,ARGUMENT,Into my grasp; then bid the women close
13604,ARGUMENT,"The massy doors, and should they hear a groan"
13605,ARGUMENT,Or other noise made by the Princes shut
13606,ARGUMENT,"Within the hall, let none set step abroad,"
13607,ARGUMENT,But all work silent. Be the palace-door
13608,ARGUMENT,"Thy charge, my good Philœtius! key it fast"
13609,ARGUMENT,"Without a moment's pause, and fix the brace.[100]"
13610,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and, returning to the hall,"
13611,ARGUMENT,Resumed his seat; nor stay'd his servants long
13612,ARGUMENT,"Without, but follow'd their illustrious Lord.                    290"
13613,ARGUMENT,Eurymachus was busily employ'd
13614,ARGUMENT,"Turning the bow, and chafing it before"
13615,ARGUMENT,"The sprightly blaze, but, after all, could find"
13616,ARGUMENT,No pow'r to bend it. Disappointment wrung
13617,ARGUMENT,"A groan from his proud heart, and thus he said."
13618,ARGUMENT,"Alas! not only for myself I grieve,"
13619,ARGUMENT,"But grieve for all. Nor, though I mourn the loss"
13620,ARGUMENT,"Of such a bride, mourn I that loss alone,"
13621,ARGUMENT,(For lovely Greecians may be found no few
13622,ARGUMENT,"In Ithaca, and in the neighbour isles)                           300"
13623,ARGUMENT,But should we so inferior prove at last
13624,ARGUMENT,"To brave Ulysses, that no force of ours"
13625,ARGUMENT,"Can bend his bow, we are for ever shamed."
13626,ARGUMENT,"To whom Antinoüs, thus, Eupithes' son."
13627,ARGUMENT,Not so; (as even thou art well-assured
13628,ARGUMENT,"Thyself, Eurymachus!) but Phœbus claims"
13629,ARGUMENT,"This day his own. Who then, on such a day,"
13630,ARGUMENT,Would strive to bend it? Let it rather rest.
13631,ARGUMENT,"And should we leave the rings where now they stand,"
13632,ARGUMENT,I trust that none ent'ring Ulysses' house                        310
13633,ARGUMENT,"Will dare displace them. Cup-bearer, attend!"
13634,ARGUMENT,"Serve all with wine, that, first, libation made,"
13635,ARGUMENT,We may religiously lay down the bow.
13636,ARGUMENT,"Command ye too Melanthius, that he drive"
13637,ARGUMENT,Hither the fairest goats of all his flocks
13638,ARGUMENT,"At dawn of day, that burning first, the thighs"
13639,ARGUMENT,"To the ethereal archer, we may make"
13640,ARGUMENT,"New trial, and decide, at length, the strife."
13641,ARGUMENT,"So spake Antinoüs, and his counsel pleased."
13642,ARGUMENT,"The heralds, then, pour'd water on their hands,                  320"
13643,ARGUMENT,While youths crown'd high the goblets which they bore
13644,ARGUMENT,"From right to left, distributing to all."
13645,ARGUMENT,"When each had made libation, and had drunk"
13646,ARGUMENT,"Till well sufficed, then, artful to effect"
13647,ARGUMENT,"His shrewd designs, Ulysses thus began."
13648,ARGUMENT,"Hear, O ye suitors of the illustrious Queen,"
13649,ARGUMENT,My bosom's dictates. But I shall entreat
13650,ARGUMENT,Chiefly Eurymachus and the godlike youth
13651,ARGUMENT,"Antinoüs, whose advice is wisely giv'n."
13652,ARGUMENT,"Tamper no longer with the bow, but leave                       330"
13653,ARGUMENT,"The matter with the Gods, who shall decide"
13654,ARGUMENT,"The strife to-morrow, fav'ring whom they will."
13655,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, grant _me_ the polish'd bow, that I"
13656,ARGUMENT,"May trial make among you of my force,"
13657,ARGUMENT,If I retain it still in like degree
13658,ARGUMENT,"As erst, or whether wand'ring and defect"
13659,ARGUMENT,Of nourishment have worn it all away.
13660,ARGUMENT,"He said, whom they with indignation heard"
13661,ARGUMENT,"Extreme, alarm'd lest he should bend the bow,"
13662,ARGUMENT,And sternly thus Antinoüs replied.                               340
13663,ARGUMENT,Desperate vagabond! ah wretch deprived
13664,ARGUMENT,Of reason utterly! art not content?
13665,ARGUMENT,Esteem'st it not distinction proud enough
13666,ARGUMENT,To feast with us the nobles of the land?
13667,ARGUMENT,"None robs thee of thy share, thou witnessest"
13668,ARGUMENT,"Our whole discourse, which, save thyself alone,"
13669,ARGUMENT,No needy vagrant is allow'd to hear.
13670,ARGUMENT,"Thou art befool'd by wine, as many have been,"
13671,ARGUMENT,"Wide-throated drinkers, unrestrain'd by rule."
13672,ARGUMENT,Wine in the mansion of the mighty Chief                          350
13673,ARGUMENT,"Pirithoüs, made the valiant Centaur mad"
13674,ARGUMENT,"Eurytion, at the Lapithæan feast.[101]"
13675,ARGUMENT,"He drank to drunkenness, and being drunk,"
13676,ARGUMENT,Committed great enormities beneath
13677,ARGUMENT,"Pirithoüs' roof, and such as fill'd with rage"
13678,ARGUMENT,The Hero-guests; who therefore by his feet
13679,ARGUMENT,"Dragg'd him right through the vestibule, amerced"
13680,ARGUMENT,"Of nose and ears, and he departed thence"
13681,ARGUMENT,"Provoked to frenzy by that foul disgrace,"
13682,ARGUMENT,Whence war between the human kind arose                          360
13683,ARGUMENT,And the bold Centaurs--but he first incurred
13684,ARGUMENT,By his ebriety that mulct severe.
13685,ARGUMENT,"Great evil, also, if thou bend the bow,"
13686,ARGUMENT,To thee I prophesy; for thou shalt find
13687,ARGUMENT,Advocate or protector none in all
13688,ARGUMENT,"This people, but we will dispatch thee hence"
13689,ARGUMENT,Incontinent on board a sable bark
13690,ARGUMENT,"To Echetus, the scourge of human kind,"
13691,ARGUMENT,"From whom is no escape. Drink then in peace,"
13692,ARGUMENT,And contest shun with younger men than thou.                     370
13693,ARGUMENT,"Him answer'd, then, Penelope discrete."
13694,ARGUMENT,Antinoüs! neither seemly were the deed
13695,ARGUMENT,"Nor just, to maim or harm whatever guest"
13696,ARGUMENT,Whom here arrived Telemachus receives.
13697,ARGUMENT,"Canst thou expect, that should he even prove"
13698,ARGUMENT,"Stronger than ye, and bend the massy bow,"
13699,ARGUMENT,"He will conduct me hence to his own home,"
13700,ARGUMENT,And make me his own bride? No such design
13701,ARGUMENT,"His heart conceives, or hope; nor let a dread"
13702,ARGUMENT,So vain the mind of any overcloud                                380
13703,ARGUMENT,"Who banquets here, since it dishonours me."
13704,ARGUMENT,"So she; to whom Eurymachus reply'd,"
13705,ARGUMENT,Offspring of Polybus. O matchless Queen!
13706,ARGUMENT,Icarius' prudent daughter! none suspects
13707,ARGUMENT,That thou wilt wed with him; a mate so mean
13708,ARGUMENT,Should ill become thee; but we fear the tongues
13709,ARGUMENT,"Of either sex, lest some Achaian say"
13710,ARGUMENT,"Hereafter, (one inferior far to us)"
13711,ARGUMENT,Ah! how unworthy are they to compare
13712,ARGUMENT,With him whose wife they seek! to bend his bow                   390
13713,ARGUMENT,"Pass'd all their pow'r, yet this poor vagabond,"
13714,ARGUMENT,"Arriving from what country none can tell,"
13715,ARGUMENT,"Bent it with ease, and shot through all the rings."
13716,ARGUMENT,"So will they speak, and so shall we be shamed."
13717,ARGUMENT,"Then answer, thus, Penelope return'd."
13718,ARGUMENT,"No fair report, Eurymachus, attends"
13719,ARGUMENT,"Their names or can, who, riotous as ye,"
13720,ARGUMENT,"The house dishonour, and consume the wealth"
13721,ARGUMENT,Of such a Chief. Why shame ye thus _yourselves_?
13722,ARGUMENT,"The guest is of athletic frame, well form'd,                     400"
13723,ARGUMENT,And large of limb; he boasts him also sprung
13724,ARGUMENT,From noble ancestry. Come then--consent--
13725,ARGUMENT,"Give him the bow, that we may see the proof;"
13726,ARGUMENT,"For thus I say, and thus will I perform;"
13727,ARGUMENT,"Sure as he bends it, and Apollo gives"
13728,ARGUMENT,"To him that glory, tunic fair and cloak"
13729,ARGUMENT,"Shall be his meed from me, a javelin keen"
13730,ARGUMENT,"To guard him against men and dogs, a sword"
13731,ARGUMENT,"Of double edge, and sandals for his feet,"
13732,ARGUMENT,And I will send him whither most he would.                       410
13733,ARGUMENT,Her answer'd then prudent Telemachus.
13734,ARGUMENT,"Mother--the bow is mine; and, save myself,"
13735,ARGUMENT,"No Greek hath right to give it, or refuse."
13736,ARGUMENT,None who in rock-bound Ithaca possess
13737,ARGUMENT,"Dominion, none in the steed-pastured isles"
13738,ARGUMENT,"Of Elis, if I chose to make the bow"
13739,ARGUMENT,"His own for ever, should that choice controul."
13740,ARGUMENT,"But thou into the house repairing, ply"
13741,ARGUMENT,"Spindle and loom, thy province, and enjoin"
13742,ARGUMENT,Diligence to thy maidens; for the bow                            420
13743,ARGUMENT,"Is man's concern alone, and shall be mine"
13744,ARGUMENT,"Especially, since I am master here."
13745,ARGUMENT,"She heard astonish'd, and the prudent speech"
13746,ARGUMENT,"Reposing of her son deep in her heart,"
13747,ARGUMENT,Withdrew; then mounting with her female train
13748,ARGUMENT,"To her superior chamber, there she wept"
13749,ARGUMENT,"Her lost Ulysses, till Minerva bathed"
13750,ARGUMENT,With balmy dews of sleep her weary lids.
13751,ARGUMENT,And now the noble swine-herd bore the bow
13752,ARGUMENT,"Toward Ulysses, but with one voice all                           430"
13753,ARGUMENT,"The suitors, clamorous, reproved the deed,"
13754,ARGUMENT,"Of whom a youth, thus, insolent exclaim'd."
13755,ARGUMENT,"Thou clumsy swine-herd, whither bear'st the bow,"
13756,ARGUMENT,Delirious wretch? the hounds that thou hast train'd
13757,ARGUMENT,Shall eat thee at thy solitary home
13758,ARGUMENT,"Ere long, let but Apollo prove, at last,"
13759,ARGUMENT,"Propitious to us, and the Pow'rs of heav'n."
13760,ARGUMENT,"So they, whom hearing he replaced the bow"
13761,ARGUMENT,"Where erst it stood, terrified at the sound"
13762,ARGUMENT,Of such loud menaces; on the other side                          440
13763,ARGUMENT,Telemachus as loud assail'd his ear.
13764,ARGUMENT,Friend! forward with the bow; or soon repent
13765,ARGUMENT,That thou obey'dst the many. I will else
13766,ARGUMENT,"With huge stones drive thee, younger as I am,"
13767,ARGUMENT,Back to the field. My strength surpasses thine.
13768,ARGUMENT,I would to heav'n that I in force excell'd
13769,ARGUMENT,"As far, and prowess, every suitor here!"
13770,ARGUMENT,So would I soon give rude dismission hence
13771,ARGUMENT,"To some, who live but to imagine harm."
13772,ARGUMENT,"He ceased, whose words the suitors laughing heard.             450"
13773,ARGUMENT,"And, for their sake, in part their wrath resign'd"
13774,ARGUMENT,Against Telemachus; then through the hall
13775,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus bore, and to Ulysses' hand"
13776,ARGUMENT,"Consign'd the bow; next, summoning abroad"
13777,ARGUMENT,"The ancient nurse, he gave her thus in charge."
13778,ARGUMENT,"It is the pleasure of Telemachus,"
13779,ARGUMENT,Sage Euryclea! that thou key secure
13780,ARGUMENT,"The doors; and should you hear, perchance, a groan"
13781,ARGUMENT,Or other noise made by the Princes shut
13782,ARGUMENT,"Within the hall, let none look, curious, forth,                  460"
13783,ARGUMENT,But each in quietness pursue her work.
13784,ARGUMENT,"So he; nor flew his words useless away,"
13785,ARGUMENT,"But she, incontinent, shut fast the doors."
13786,ARGUMENT,"Then, noiseless, sprang Philœtius forth, who closed"
13787,ARGUMENT,The portals also of the palace-court.
13788,ARGUMENT,"A ship-rope of Ægyptian reed, it chanced,"
13789,ARGUMENT,Lay in the vestibule; with that he braced
13790,ARGUMENT,"The doors securely, and re-entring fill'd"
13791,ARGUMENT,"Again his seat, but watchful, eyed his Lord."
13792,ARGUMENT,"He, now, assaying with his hand the bow,                         470"
13793,ARGUMENT,"Made curious trial of it ev'ry way,"
13794,ARGUMENT,"And turn'd it on all sides, lest haply worms"
13795,ARGUMENT,Had in its master's absence drill'd the horn.
13796,ARGUMENT,Then thus a suitor to his next remark'd.
13797,ARGUMENT,"He hath an eye, methinks, exactly skill'd"
13798,ARGUMENT,"In bows, and steals them; or perhaps, at home,"
13799,ARGUMENT,"Hath such himself, or feels a strong desire"
13800,ARGUMENT,To make them; so inquisitive the rogue
13801,ARGUMENT,"Adept in mischief, shifts it to and fro!"
13802,ARGUMENT,"To whom another, insolent, replied.                            480"
13803,ARGUMENT,I wish him like prosperity in all
13804,ARGUMENT,"His efforts, as attends his effort made"
13805,ARGUMENT,"On this same bow, which he shall never bend."
13806,ARGUMENT,So they; but when the wary Hero wise
13807,ARGUMENT,Had made his hand familiar with the bow
13808,ARGUMENT,Poising it and examining--at once--
13809,ARGUMENT,"As when in harp and song adept, a bard"
13810,ARGUMENT,"Unlab'ring strains the chord to a new lyre,"
13811,ARGUMENT,The twisted entrails of a sheep below
13812,ARGUMENT,"With fingers nice inserting, and above,                          490"
13813,ARGUMENT,With such facility Ulysses bent
13814,ARGUMENT,"His own huge bow, and with his right hand play'd"
13815,ARGUMENT,"The nerve, which in its quick vibration sang"
13816,ARGUMENT,Clear as the swallow's voice. Keen anguish seized
13817,ARGUMENT,"The suitors, wan grew ev'ry cheek, and Jove"
13818,ARGUMENT,Gave him his rolling thunder for a sign.
13819,ARGUMENT,"That omen, granted to him by the son"
13820,ARGUMENT,"Of wily Saturn, with delight he heard."
13821,ARGUMENT,He took a shaft that at the table-side
13822,ARGUMENT,Lay ready drawn; but in his quiver's womb                        500
13823,ARGUMENT,"The rest yet slept, by those Achaians proud"
13824,ARGUMENT,"To be, ere long, experienced. True he lodg'd"
13825,ARGUMENT,"The arrow on the centre of the bow,"
13826,ARGUMENT,"And, occupying still his seat, drew home"
13827,ARGUMENT,Nerve and notch'd arrow-head; with stedfast sight
13828,ARGUMENT,He aimed and sent it; right through all the rings
13829,ARGUMENT,From first to last the steel-charged weapon flew
13830,ARGUMENT,"Issuing beyond, and to his son he spake."
13831,ARGUMENT,"Thou need'st not blush, young Prince, to have received"
13832,ARGUMENT,"A guest like me; neither my arrow swerved,                       510"
13833,ARGUMENT,Nor labour'd I long time to draw the bow;
13834,ARGUMENT,"My strength is unimpair'd, not such as these"
13835,ARGUMENT,In scorn affirm it. But the waning day
13836,ARGUMENT,"Calls us to supper, after which succeeds[102]"
13837,ARGUMENT,"Jocund variety, the song, the harp,"
13838,ARGUMENT,With all that heightens and adorns the feast.
13839,ARGUMENT,"He said, and with his brows gave him the sign."
13840,ARGUMENT,At once the son of the illustrious Chief
13841,ARGUMENT,"Slung his keen faulchion, grasp'd his spear, and stood"
13842,ARGUMENT,Arm'd bright for battle at his father's side.                    520

13885,ARGUMENT,

13887,ARGUMENT,"Then, girding up his rags, Ulysses sprang"
13888,ARGUMENT,With bow and full-charged quiver to the door;
13889,ARGUMENT,Loose on the broad stone at his feet he pour'd
13890,ARGUMENT,"His arrows, and the suitors, thus, bespake."
13891,ARGUMENT,"This prize, though difficult, hath been atchieved."
13892,ARGUMENT,Now for another mark which never man

13901,ARGUMENT,"Should plan his death, and execute the blow?"
13902,ARGUMENT,Yet him Ulysses with an arrow pierced
13903,ARGUMENT,"Full in the throat, and through his neck behind"

13930,ARGUMENT,"He said; their cheeks all faded at the sound,"
13931,ARGUMENT,And each with sharpen'd eyes search'd ev'ry nook
13932,ARGUMENT,"For an escape from his impending doom,"
13933,ARGUMENT,"Till thus, alone, Eurymachus replied."
13934,ARGUMENT,"If thou indeed art he, the mighty Chief"
13935,ARGUMENT,"Of Ithaca return'd, thou hast rehears'd"
13936,ARGUMENT,With truth the crimes committed by the Greeks                     50
13937,ARGUMENT,"Frequent, both in thy house and in thy field."
13938,ARGUMENT,"But he, already, who was cause of all,"
13939,ARGUMENT,"Lies slain, Antinoüs; he thy palace fill'd"
13940,ARGUMENT,"With outrage, not solicitous so much"
13941,ARGUMENT,"To win the fair Penelope, but thoughts"
13942,ARGUMENT,"Far diff'rent framing, which Saturnian Jove"
13943,ARGUMENT,"Hath baffled all; to rule, himself, supreme"
13944,ARGUMENT,"In noble Ithaca, when he had kill'd"
13945,ARGUMENT,By an insidious stratagem thy son.
13946,ARGUMENT,"But he is slain. Now therefore, spare thy own,                    60"
13947,ARGUMENT,Thy people; public reparation due
13948,ARGUMENT,"Shall sure be thine, and to appease thy wrath"
13949,ARGUMENT,"For all the waste that, eating, drinking here"
13950,ARGUMENT,"We have committed, we will yield thee, each,"
13951,ARGUMENT,"Full twenty beeves, gold paying thee beside"
13952,ARGUMENT,"And brass, till joy shall fill thee at the sight,"
13953,ARGUMENT,However just thine anger was before.
13954,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, frowning stern, replied,"
13955,ARGUMENT,"Eurymachus, would ye contribute each"
13956,ARGUMENT,"His whole inheritance, and other sums                             70"
13957,ARGUMENT,"Still add beside, ye should not, even so,"
13958,ARGUMENT,"These hands of mine bribe to abstain from blood,"
13959,ARGUMENT,Till ev'ry suitor suffer for his wrong.
13960,ARGUMENT,"Ye have your choice. Fight with me, or escape"
13961,ARGUMENT,"(Whoever may) the terrours of his fate,"
13962,ARGUMENT,"But ye all perish, if my thought be true."
13963,ARGUMENT,"He ended, they with trembling knees and hearts"
13964,ARGUMENT,"All heard, whom thus Eurymachus address'd."
13965,ARGUMENT,"To your defence, my friends! for respite none"
13966,ARGUMENT,"Will he to his victorious hands afford,                           80"
13967,ARGUMENT,"But, arm'd with bow and quiver, will dispatch"
13968,ARGUMENT,Shafts from the door till he have slain us all.
13969,ARGUMENT,Therefore to arms--draw each his sword--oppose
13970,ARGUMENT,"The tables to his shafts, and all at once"
13971,ARGUMENT,"Rush on him; that, dislodging him at least"
13972,ARGUMENT,"From portal and from threshold, we may give"
13973,ARGUMENT,"The city on all sides a loud alarm,"
13974,ARGUMENT,So shall this archer soon have shot his last.
13975,ARGUMENT,"Thus saying, he drew his brazen faulchion keen"
13976,ARGUMENT,"Of double edge, and with a dreadful cry                           90"
13977,ARGUMENT,Sprang on him; but Ulysses with a shaft
13978,ARGUMENT,In that same moment through his bosom driv'n
13979,ARGUMENT,"Transfix'd his liver, and down dropp'd his sword."
13980,ARGUMENT,"He, staggering around his table, fell"
13981,ARGUMENT,"Convolv'd in agonies, and overturn'd"
13982,ARGUMENT,Both food and wine; his forehead smote the floor;
13983,ARGUMENT,"Woe fill'd his heart, and spurning with his heels"
13984,ARGUMENT,"His vacant seat, he shook it till he died."
13985,ARGUMENT,"Then, with his faulchion drawn, Amphinomus"
13986,ARGUMENT,"Advanced to drive Ulysses from the door,                         100"
13987,ARGUMENT,"And fierce was his assault; but, from behind,"
13988,ARGUMENT,Telemachus between his shoulders fix'd
13989,ARGUMENT,"A brazen lance, and urged it through his breast."
13990,ARGUMENT,"Full on his front, with hideous sound, he fell."
13991,ARGUMENT,Leaving the weapon planted in his spine
13992,ARGUMENT,"Back flew Telemachus, lest, had he stood"
13993,ARGUMENT,"Drawing it forth, some enemy, perchance,"
13994,ARGUMENT,Should either pierce him with a sudden thrust
13995,ARGUMENT,"Oblique, or hew him with a downright edge."
13996,ARGUMENT,"Swift, therefore, to his father's side he ran,                   110"
13997,ARGUMENT,"Whom reaching, in wing'd accents thus he said."
13998,ARGUMENT,"My father! I will now bring thee a shield,"
13999,ARGUMENT,"An helmet, and two spears; I will enclose"
14000,ARGUMENT,"Myself in armour also, and will give"
14001,ARGUMENT,Both to the herdsmen and Eumæus arms
14002,ARGUMENT,"Expedient now, and needful for us all."
14003,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
14004,ARGUMENT,"Run; fetch them, while I yet have arrows left,"
14005,ARGUMENT,"Lest, single, I be justled from the door."
14006,ARGUMENT,"He said, and, at his word, forth went the Prince,              120"
14007,ARGUMENT,Seeking the chamber where he had secured
14008,ARGUMENT,"The armour. Thence he took four shields, eight spears,"
14009,ARGUMENT,"With four hair-crested helmets, charged with which"
14010,ARGUMENT,"He hasted to his father's side again,"
14011,ARGUMENT,"And, arming first himself, furnish'd with arms"
14012,ARGUMENT,"His two attendants. Then, all clad alike"
14013,ARGUMENT,"In splendid brass, beside the dauntless Chief"
14014,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, his auxiliars firm they stood."
14015,ARGUMENT,"He, while a single arrow unemploy'd"
14016,ARGUMENT,"Lay at his foot, right-aiming, ever pierced                      130"
14017,ARGUMENT,"Some suitor through, and heaps on heaps they fell."
14018,ARGUMENT,"But when his arrows fail'd the royal Chief,"
14019,ARGUMENT,His bow reclining at the portal's side
14020,ARGUMENT,"Against the palace-wall, he slung, himself,"
14021,ARGUMENT,"A four-fold buckler on his arm, he fix'd"
14022,ARGUMENT,A casque whose crest wav'd awful o'er his brows
14023,ARGUMENT,"On his illustrious head, and fill'd his gripe"
14024,ARGUMENT,"With two stout spears, well-headed both, with brass."
14025,ARGUMENT,There was a certain postern in the wall[103]
14026,ARGUMENT,"At the gate-side, the customary pass                             140"
14027,ARGUMENT,"Into a narrow street, but barr'd secure."
14028,ARGUMENT,Ulysses bade his faithful swine-herd watch
14029,ARGUMENT,"That egress, station'd near it, for it own'd"
14030,ARGUMENT,One sole approach; then Agelaüs loud
14031,ARGUMENT,"Exhorting all the suitors, thus exclaim'd."
14032,ARGUMENT,"Oh friends, will none, ascending to the door"
14033,ARGUMENT,"Of yonder postern, summon to our aid"
14034,ARGUMENT,"The populace, and spread a wide alarm?"
14035,ARGUMENT,So shall this archer soon have shot his last.
14036,ARGUMENT,To whom the keeper of the goats replied                        150
14037,ARGUMENT,Melanthius. Agelaüs! Prince renown'd!
14038,ARGUMENT,That may not be. The postern and the gate[104]
14039,ARGUMENT,"Neighbour too near each other, and to force"
14040,ARGUMENT,The narrow egress were a vain attempt;
14041,ARGUMENT,One valiant man might thence repulse us all.
14042,ARGUMENT,But come--myself will furnish you with arms
14043,ARGUMENT,"Fetch'd from above; for there, as I suppose,"
14044,ARGUMENT,(And not elsewhere) Ulysses and his son
14045,ARGUMENT,"Have hidden them, and there they shall be found."
14046,ARGUMENT,"So spake Melanthius, and, ascending, sought                    160"
14047,ARGUMENT,Ulysses' chambers through the winding stairs
14048,ARGUMENT,And gall'ries of the house. Twelve bucklers thence
14049,ARGUMENT,"He took, as many spears, and helmets bright"
14050,ARGUMENT,"As many, shagg'd with hair, then swift return'd"
14051,ARGUMENT,And gave them to his friends. Trembled the heart
14052,ARGUMENT,"Of brave Ulysses, and his knees, at sight"
14053,ARGUMENT,"Of his opposers putting armour on,"
14054,ARGUMENT,And shaking each his spear; arduous indeed
14055,ARGUMENT,"Now seem'd his task, and in wing'd accents brief"
14056,ARGUMENT,Thus to his son Telemachus he spake.                             170
14057,ARGUMENT,Either some woman of our train contrives
14058,ARGUMENT,"Hard battle for us, furnishing with arms"
14059,ARGUMENT,"The suitors, or Melanthius arms them all."
14060,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then Telemachus discrete.
14061,ARGUMENT,"Father, this fault was mine, and be it charged"
14062,ARGUMENT,On none beside; I left the chamber-door
14063,ARGUMENT,"Unbarr'd, which, more attentive than myself,"
14064,ARGUMENT,"Their spy perceived. But haste, Eumæus, shut"
14065,ARGUMENT,"The chamber-door, observing well, the while,"
14066,ARGUMENT,If any women of our train have done                              180
14067,ARGUMENT,"This deed, or whether, as I more suspect,"
14068,ARGUMENT,"Melanthius, Dolius' son, have giv'n them arms."
14069,ARGUMENT,"Thus mutual they conferr'd; meantime, again"
14070,ARGUMENT,Melanthius to the chamber flew in quest
14071,ARGUMENT,"Of other arms. Eumæus, as he went,"
14072,ARGUMENT,"Mark'd him, and to Ulysses' thus he spake."
14073,ARGUMENT,"Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!"
14074,ARGUMENT,"Behold, the traytor, whom ourselves supposed,"
14075,ARGUMENT,"Seeks yet again the chamber! Tell me plain,"
14076,ARGUMENT,"Shall I, should I superior prove in force,                       190"
14077,ARGUMENT,"Slay him, or shall I drag him thence to thee,"
14078,ARGUMENT,That he may suffer at thy hands the doom
14079,ARGUMENT,Due to his treasons perpetrated oft
14080,ARGUMENT,"Against thee, here, even in thy own house?"
14081,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus Ulysses shrewd return'd.
14082,ARGUMENT,"I, with Telemachus, will here immew"
14083,ARGUMENT,"The lordly suitors close, rage as they may."
14084,ARGUMENT,"Ye two, the while, bind fast Melanthius' hands"
14085,ARGUMENT,"And feet behind his back, then cast him bound"
14086,ARGUMENT,"Into the chamber, and (the door secured)                         200"
14087,ARGUMENT,"Pass underneath his arms a double chain,"
14088,ARGUMENT,And by a pillar's top weigh him aloft
14089,ARGUMENT,"Till he approach the rafters, there to endure,"
14090,ARGUMENT,"Living long time, the mis'ries he hath earned."
14091,ARGUMENT,He spake; they prompt obey'd; together both
14092,ARGUMENT,"They sought the chamber, whom the wretch within"
14093,ARGUMENT,"Heard not, exploring ev'ry nook for arms."
14094,ARGUMENT,"They watching stood the door, from which, at length,"
14095,ARGUMENT,"Forth came Melanthius, bearing in one hand"
14096,ARGUMENT,"A casque, and in the other a broad shield                        210"
14097,ARGUMENT,"Time-worn and chapp'd with drought, which in his youth"
14098,ARGUMENT,Warlike Laertes had been wont to bear.
14099,ARGUMENT,"Long time neglected it had lain, till age"
14100,ARGUMENT,Had loosed the sutures of its bands. At once
14101,ARGUMENT,"Both, springing on him, seized and drew him in"
14102,ARGUMENT,"Forcibly by his locks, then cast him down"
14103,ARGUMENT,"Prone on the pavement, trembling at his fate."
14104,ARGUMENT,With painful stricture of the cord his hands
14105,ARGUMENT,"They bound and feet together at his back,"
14106,ARGUMENT,"As their illustrious master had enjoined,                        220"
14107,ARGUMENT,Then weigh'd him with a double chain aloft
14108,ARGUMENT,"By a tall pillar to the palace-roof,"
14109,ARGUMENT,"And thus, deriding him, Eumæus spake."
14110,ARGUMENT,"Now, good Melanthius, on that fleecy bed"
14111,ARGUMENT,"Reclined, as well befits thee, thou wilt watch"
14112,ARGUMENT,"All night, nor when the golden dawn forsakes"
14113,ARGUMENT,"The ocean stream, will she escape thine eye,"
14114,ARGUMENT,But thou wilt duly to the palace drive
14115,ARGUMENT,"The fattest goats, a banquet for thy friends."
14116,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he left him in his dreadful sling.                  230"
14117,ARGUMENT,"Then, arming both, and barring fast the door,"
14118,ARGUMENT,They sought brave Laertiades again.
14119,ARGUMENT,"And now, courageous at the portal stood"
14120,ARGUMENT,"Those four, by numbers in the interior house"
14121,ARGUMENT,"Opposed of adversaries fierce in arms,"
14122,ARGUMENT,"When Pallas, in the form and with the voice"
14123,ARGUMENT,"Approach'd of Mentor, whom Laertes' son"
14124,ARGUMENT,"Beheld, and joyful at the sight, exclaim'd."
14125,ARGUMENT,"Help, Mentor! help--now recollect a friend"
14126,ARGUMENT,"And benefactor, born when thou wast born.                        240"
14127,ARGUMENT,"So he, not unsuspicious that he saw"
14128,ARGUMENT,"Pallas, the heroine of heav'n. Meantime"
14129,ARGUMENT,"The suitors fill'd with menaces the dome,"
14130,ARGUMENT,"And Agelaüs, first, Damastor's son,"
14131,ARGUMENT,In accents harsh rebuked the Goddess thus.
14132,ARGUMENT,"Beware, oh Mentor! that he lure thee not"
14133,ARGUMENT,"To oppose the suitors and to aid himself,"
14134,ARGUMENT,For thus will we. Ulysses and his son
14135,ARGUMENT,"Both slain, in vengeance of thy purpos'd deeds"
14136,ARGUMENT,"Against us, we will slay _thee_ next, and thou                   250"
14137,ARGUMENT,With thy own head shalt satisfy the wrong.
14138,ARGUMENT,"Your force thus quell'd in battle, all thy wealth"
14139,ARGUMENT,"Whether in house or field, mingled with his,"
14140,ARGUMENT,"We will confiscate, neither will we leave"
14141,ARGUMENT,"Or son of thine, or daughter in thy house"
14142,ARGUMENT,"Alive, nor shall thy virtuous consort more"
14143,ARGUMENT,Within the walls of Ithaca be seen.
14144,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and his words with wrath inflamed"
14145,ARGUMENT,"Minerva's heart the more; incensed, she turn'd"
14146,ARGUMENT,"Towards Ulysses, whom she thus reproved.                         260"
14147,ARGUMENT,"Thou neither own'st the courage nor the force,"
14148,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, now, which nine whole years thou showd'st"
14149,ARGUMENT,"At Ilium, waging battle obstinate"
14150,ARGUMENT,"For high-born Helen, and in horrid fight"
14151,ARGUMENT,"Destroying multitudes, till thy advice"
14152,ARGUMENT,At last lay'd Priam's bulwark'd city low.
14153,ARGUMENT,"Why, in possession of thy proper home"
14154,ARGUMENT,"And substance, mourn'st thou want of pow'r t'oppose"
14155,ARGUMENT,"The suitors? Stand beside me, mark my deeds,"
14156,ARGUMENT,And thou shalt own Mentor Alcimides                              270
14157,ARGUMENT,"A valiant friend, and mindful of thy love."
14158,ARGUMENT,She spake; nor made she victory as yet
14159,ARGUMENT,"Entire his own, proving the valour, first,"
14160,ARGUMENT,"Both of the sire and of his glorious son,"
14161,ARGUMENT,"But, springing in a swallow's form aloft,"
14162,ARGUMENT,Perch'd on a rafter of the splendid roof.
14163,ARGUMENT,"Then, Agelaüs animated loud"
14164,ARGUMENT,"The suitors, whom Eurynomus also roused,"
14165,ARGUMENT,"Amphimedon, and Demoptolemus,"
14166,ARGUMENT,"And Polyctorides, Pisander named,                                280"
14167,ARGUMENT,And Polybus the brave; for noblest far
14168,ARGUMENT,Of all the suitor-chiefs who now survived
14169,ARGUMENT,And fought for life were these. The bow had quell'd
14170,ARGUMENT,"And shafts, in quick succession sent, the rest."
14171,ARGUMENT,"Then Agelaüs, thus, harangued them all."
14172,ARGUMENT,"We soon shall tame, O friends, this warrior's might,"
14173,ARGUMENT,"Whom Mentor, after all his airy vaunts"
14174,ARGUMENT,"Hath left, and at the portal now remain"
14175,ARGUMENT,"Themselves alone. Dismiss not therefore, all,"
14176,ARGUMENT,"Your spears together, but with six alone                         290"
14177,ARGUMENT,"Assail them first; Jove willing, we shall pierce"
14178,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, and subduing him, shall slay"
14179,ARGUMENT,With ease the rest; their force is safely scorn'd.
14180,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd; and, as he bade, six hurl'd the spear"
14181,ARGUMENT,Together; but Minerva gave them all
14182,ARGUMENT,"A devious flight; one struck a column, one"
14183,ARGUMENT,"The planks of the broad portal, and a third[105]"
14184,ARGUMENT,Flung right his ashen beam pond'rous with brass
14185,ARGUMENT,Against the wall. Then (ev'ry suitor's spear
14186,ARGUMENT,Eluded) thus Ulysses gave the word--                             300
14187,ARGUMENT,Now friends! I counsel you that ye dismiss
14188,ARGUMENT,"Your spears at _them_, who, not content with past"
14189,ARGUMENT,"Enormities, thirst also for our blood."
14190,ARGUMENT,"He said, and with unerring aim, all threw"
14191,ARGUMENT,Their glitt'ring spears. Ulysses on the ground
14192,ARGUMENT,Stretch'd Demoptolemus; Euryades
14193,ARGUMENT,Fell by Telemachus; the swine-herd slew
14194,ARGUMENT,Elătus; and the keeper of the beeves
14195,ARGUMENT,Pisander; in one moment all alike
14196,ARGUMENT,Lay grinding with their teeth the dusty floor.                   310
14197,ARGUMENT,"Back flew the suitors to the farthest wall,"
14198,ARGUMENT,"On whom those valiant four advancing, each"
14199,ARGUMENT,"Recover'd, quick, his weapon from the dead."
14200,ARGUMENT,Then hurl'd the desp'rate suitors yet again
14201,ARGUMENT,"Their glitt'ring spears, but Pallas gave to each"
14202,ARGUMENT,"A frustrate course; one struck a column, one"
14203,ARGUMENT,"The planks of the broad portal, and a third"
14204,ARGUMENT,Flung full his ashen beam against the walăl.
14205,ARGUMENT,"Yet pierced Amphimedon the Prince's wrist,"
14206,ARGUMENT,"But slightly, a skin-wound, and o'er his shield                  320"
14207,ARGUMENT,Ctesippus reach'd the shoulder of the good
14208,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus, but his glancing weapon swift"
14209,ARGUMENT,"O'erflew the mark, and fell. And now the four,"
14210,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, dauntless Hero, and his friends"
14211,ARGUMENT,"All hurl'd their spears together in return,"
14212,ARGUMENT,"Himself Ulysses, city-waster Chief,"
14213,ARGUMENT,Wounded Eurydamas; Ulysses' son
14214,ARGUMENT,Amphimedon; the swine-herd Polybus;
14215,ARGUMENT,And in his breast the keeper of the beeves
14216,ARGUMENT,"Ctesippus, glorying over whom, he cried.                         330"
14217,ARGUMENT,Oh son of Polytherses! whose delight
14218,ARGUMENT,"Hath been to taunt and jeer, never again"
14219,ARGUMENT,"Boast foolishly, but to the Gods commit"
14220,ARGUMENT,"Thy tongue, since they are mightier far than thou."
14221,ARGUMENT,Take this--a compensation for thy pledge
14222,ARGUMENT,"Of hospitality, the huge ox-hoof,"
14223,ARGUMENT,"Which while he roam'd the palace, begging alms,"
14224,ARGUMENT,Ulysses at thy bounteous hand received.
14225,ARGUMENT,"So gloried he; then, grasping still his spear,"
14226,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses pierced Damastor's son, and, next,                       340"
14227,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, enforcing his long beam"
14228,ARGUMENT,"Sheer through his bowels and his back, transpierced"
14229,ARGUMENT,"Leiocritus, he prostrate smote the floor."
14230,ARGUMENT,"Then, Pallas from the lofty roof held forth"
14231,ARGUMENT,"Her host-confounding Ægis o'er their heads,"
14232,ARGUMENT,With'ring their souls with fear. They through the hall
14233,ARGUMENT,"Fled, scatter'd as an herd, which rapid-wing'd"
14234,ARGUMENT,"The gad-fly dissipates, infester fell"
14235,ARGUMENT,"Of beeves, when vernal suns shine hot and long."
14236,ARGUMENT,"But, as when bow-beak'd vultures crooked-claw'd[106]             350"
14237,ARGUMENT,Stoop from the mountains on the smaller fowl;
14238,ARGUMENT,Terrified at the toils that spread the plain
14239,ARGUMENT,"The flocks take wing, they, darting from above,"
14240,ARGUMENT,"Strike, seize, and slay, resistance or escape"
14241,ARGUMENT,"Is none, the fowler's heart leaps with delight,"
14242,ARGUMENT,"So they, pursuing through the spacious hall"
14243,ARGUMENT,"The suitors, smote them on all sides, their heads"
14244,ARGUMENT,"Sounded beneath the sword, with hideous groans"
14245,ARGUMENT,"The palace rang, and the floor foamed with blood."
14246,ARGUMENT,"Then flew Leiodes to Ulysses' knees,                             360"
14247,ARGUMENT,"Which clasping, in wing'd accents thus he cried."
14248,ARGUMENT,"I clasp thy knees, Ulysses! oh respect"
14249,ARGUMENT,"My suit, and spare me! Never have I word"
14250,ARGUMENT,"Injurious spoken, or injurious deed"
14251,ARGUMENT,"Attempted 'gainst the women of thy house,"
14252,ARGUMENT,"But others, so transgressing, oft forbad."
14253,ARGUMENT,"Yet they abstain'd not, and a dreadful fate"
14254,ARGUMENT,"Due to their wickedness have, therefore, found."
14255,ARGUMENT,"But I, their soothsayer alone, must fall,"
14256,ARGUMENT,Though unoffending; such is the return                           370
14257,ARGUMENT,By mortals made for benefits received!
14258,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, louring dark, replied."
14259,ARGUMENT,Is that thy boast? Hast thou indeed for these
14260,ARGUMENT,"The seer's high office fill'd? Then, doubtless, oft"
14261,ARGUMENT,Thy pray'r hath been that distant far might prove
14262,ARGUMENT,"The day delectable of my return,"
14263,ARGUMENT,And that my consort might thy own become
14264,ARGUMENT,To bear thee children; wherefore thee I doom
14265,ARGUMENT,To a dire death which thou shalt not avoid.
14266,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he caught the faulchion from the floor              380"
14267,ARGUMENT,"Which Agelaüs had let fall, and smote"
14268,ARGUMENT,"Leiodes, while he kneel'd, athwart his neck"
14269,ARGUMENT,"So suddenly, that ere his tongue had ceased"
14270,ARGUMENT,"To plead for life, his head was in the dust."
14271,ARGUMENT,"But Phemius, son of Terpius, bard divine,"
14272,ARGUMENT,"Who, through compulsion, with his song regaled"
14273,ARGUMENT,"The suitors, a like dreadful death escaped."
14274,ARGUMENT,"Fast by the postern, harp in hand, he stood,"
14275,ARGUMENT,"Doubtful if, issuing, he should take his seat"
14276,ARGUMENT,"Beside the altar of Hercæan Jove,[107]                           390"
14277,ARGUMENT,"Where oft Ulysses offer'd, and his sire,"
14278,ARGUMENT,"Fat thighs of beeves, or whether he should haste,"
14279,ARGUMENT,"An earnest suppliant, to embrace his knees."
14280,ARGUMENT,"That course, at length, most pleased him; then, between"
14281,ARGUMENT,The beaker and an argent-studded throne
14282,ARGUMENT,"He grounded his sweet lyre, and seizing fast"
14283,ARGUMENT,"The Hero's knees, him, suppliant, thus address'd."
14284,ARGUMENT,"I clasp thy knees, Ulysses! oh respect"
14285,ARGUMENT,"My suit, and spare me. Thou shalt not escape"
14286,ARGUMENT,"Regret thyself hereafter, if thou slay                           400"
14287,ARGUMENT,"Me, charmer of the woes of Gods and men."
14288,ARGUMENT,"Self-taught am I, and treasure in my mind"
14289,ARGUMENT,"Themes of all argument from heav'n inspired,"
14290,ARGUMENT,And I can sing to thee as to a God.
14291,ARGUMENT,"Ah, then, behead me not. Put ev'n the wish"
14292,ARGUMENT,Far from thee! for thy own beloved son
14293,ARGUMENT,"Can witness, that not drawn by choice, or driv'n"
14294,ARGUMENT,"By stress of want, resorting to thine house"
14295,ARGUMENT,"I have regaled these revellers so oft,"
14296,ARGUMENT,But under force of mightier far than I.                          410
14297,ARGUMENT,So he; whose words soon as the sacred might
14298,ARGUMENT,"Heard of Telemachus, approaching quick"
14299,ARGUMENT,"His father, thus, humane, he interposed."
14300,ARGUMENT,"Hold, harm not with the vengeful faulchion's edge"
14301,ARGUMENT,This blameless man; and we will also spare
14302,ARGUMENT,"Medon the herald, who hath ever been"
14303,ARGUMENT,"A watchful guardian of my boyish years,"
14304,ARGUMENT,"Unless Philœtius have already slain him,"
14305,ARGUMENT,"Or else Eumæus, or thyself, perchance,"
14306,ARGUMENT,"Unconscious, in the tumult of our foes.                          420"
14307,ARGUMENT,"He spake, whom Medon hearing (for he lay"
14308,ARGUMENT,"Beneath a throne, and in a new-stript hide"
14309,ARGUMENT,"Enfolded, trembling with the dread of death)"
14310,ARGUMENT,"Sprang from his hiding-place, and casting off"
14311,ARGUMENT,"The skin, flew to Telemachus, embraced"
14312,ARGUMENT,"His knees, and in wing'd accents thus exclaim'd."
14313,ARGUMENT,"Prince! I am here--oh, pity me! repress"
14314,ARGUMENT,"Thine own, and pacify thy father's wrath,"
14315,ARGUMENT,"That he destroy not me, through fierce revenge"
14316,ARGUMENT,Of their iniquities who have consumed                            430
14317,ARGUMENT,"His wealth, and, in their folly scorn'd his son."
14318,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied,"
14319,ARGUMENT,Smiling complacent. Fear not; my own son
14320,ARGUMENT,Hath pleaded for thee. Therefore (taught thyself
14321,ARGUMENT,That truth) teach others the superior worth
14322,ARGUMENT,Of benefits with injuries compared.
14323,ARGUMENT,"But go ye forth, thou and the sacred bard,"
14324,ARGUMENT,That ye may sit distant in yonder court
14325,ARGUMENT,"From all this carnage, while I give command,"
14326,ARGUMENT,"Myself, concerning it, to those within.                          440"
14327,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd; they going forth, took each his seat"
14328,ARGUMENT,"Beside Jove's altar, but with careful looks"
14329,ARGUMENT,"Suspicious, dreading without cease the sword."
14330,ARGUMENT,"Meantime Ulysses search'd his hall, in quest"
14331,ARGUMENT,"Of living foes, if any still survived"
14332,ARGUMENT,Unpunish'd; but he found them all alike
14333,ARGUMENT,Welt'ring in dust and blood; num'rous they lay
14334,ARGUMENT,Like fishes when they strew the sinuous shore
14335,ARGUMENT,"Of Ocean, from the grey gulph drawn aground"
14336,ARGUMENT,In nets of many a mesh; they on the sands                        450
14337,ARGUMENT,"Lie spread, athirst for the salt wave, till hot"
14338,ARGUMENT,The gazing sun dries all their life away;
14339,ARGUMENT,"So lay the suitors heap'd, and thus at length"
14340,ARGUMENT,The prudent Chief gave order to his son.
14341,ARGUMENT,Telemachus! bid Euryclea come
14342,ARGUMENT,"Quickly, the nurse, to whom I would impart"
14343,ARGUMENT,The purpose which now occupies me most.
14344,ARGUMENT,"He said; obedient to his sire, the Prince"
14345,ARGUMENT,"Smote on the door, and summon'd loud the nurse."
14346,ARGUMENT,Arise thou ancient governess of all                            460
14347,ARGUMENT,"Our female menials, and come forth; attend"
14348,ARGUMENT,My father; he hath somewhat for thine ear.
14349,ARGUMENT,"So he; nor flew his words useless away,"
14350,ARGUMENT,"For, throwing wide the portal, forth she came,"
14351,ARGUMENT,"And, by Telemachus conducted, found"
14352,ARGUMENT,"Ere long Ulysses amid all the slain,"
14353,ARGUMENT,With blood defiled and dust; dread he appear'd
14354,ARGUMENT,As from the pastur'd ox newly-devoured
14355,ARGUMENT,The lion stalking back; his ample chest
14356,ARGUMENT,"With gory drops and his broad cheeks are hung,                   470"
14357,ARGUMENT,"Tremendous spectacle! such seem'd the Chief,"
14358,ARGUMENT,"Blood-stain'd all over. She, the carnage spread"
14359,ARGUMENT,"On all sides seeing, and the pools of blood,"
14360,ARGUMENT,Felt impulse forcible to publish loud
14361,ARGUMENT,That wond'rous triumph; but her Lord repress'd
14362,ARGUMENT,"The shout of rapture ere it burst abroad,"
14363,ARGUMENT,And in wing'd accents thus his will enforced.
14364,ARGUMENT,"Silent exult, O ancient matron dear!"
14365,ARGUMENT,"Shout not, be still. Unholy is the voice"
14366,ARGUMENT,Of loud thanksgiving over slaughter'd men.                       480
14367,ARGUMENT,Their own atrocious deeds and the Gods' will
14368,ARGUMENT,Have slain all these; for whether noble guest
14369,ARGUMENT,"Arrived or base, they scoff'd at all alike,"
14370,ARGUMENT,"And for their wickedness have, therefore, died."
14371,ARGUMENT,"But say; of my domestic women, who"
14372,ARGUMENT,"Have scorn'd me, and whom find'st thou innocent?"
14373,ARGUMENT,To whom good Euryclea thus replied.
14374,ARGUMENT,My son! I will declare the truth; thou keep'st
14375,ARGUMENT,"Female domestics fifty in thy house,"
14376,ARGUMENT,Whom we have made intelligent to comb                            490
14377,ARGUMENT,"The fleece, and to perform whatever task."
14378,ARGUMENT,"Of these, twice six have overpass'd the bounds"
14379,ARGUMENT,"Of modesty, respecting neither me,"
14380,ARGUMENT,"Nor yet the Queen; and thy own son, adult"
14381,ARGUMENT,"So lately, no permission had from her"
14382,ARGUMENT,To regulate the women of her train.
14383,ARGUMENT,"But I am gone, I fly with what hath pass'd"
14384,ARGUMENT,"To the Queen's ear, who nought suspects, so sound"
14385,ARGUMENT,"She sleeps, by some divinity composed."
14386,ARGUMENT,"Then answer, thus, Ulysses wise returned.                      500"
14387,ARGUMENT,"Hush, and disturb her not. Go. Summon first"
14388,ARGUMENT,"Those wantons, who have long deserved to die."
14389,ARGUMENT,He ceas'd; then issued forth the ancient dame
14390,ARGUMENT,"To summon those bad women, and, meantime,"
14391,ARGUMENT,"Calling his son, Philœtius, and Eumæus,"
14392,ARGUMENT,Ulysses in wing'd accents thus began.
14393,ARGUMENT,"Bestir ye, and remove the dead; command"
14394,ARGUMENT,Those women also to your help; then cleanse
14395,ARGUMENT,With bibulous sponges and with water all
14396,ARGUMENT,The seats and tables; when ye shall have thus                    510
14397,ARGUMENT,"Set all in order, lead those women forth,"
14398,ARGUMENT,"And in the centre of the spacious court,"
14399,ARGUMENT,Between the scull'ry and the outer-wall
14400,ARGUMENT,Smite them with your broad faulchions till they lose
14401,ARGUMENT,In death the mem'ry of their secret loves
14402,ARGUMENT,Indulged with wretches lawless as themselves.
14403,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and the damsels came at once"
14404,ARGUMENT,"All forth, lamenting, and with tepid tears"
14405,ARGUMENT,"Show'ring the ground; with mutual labour, first,"
14406,ARGUMENT,"Bearing the bodies forth into the court,                         520"
14407,ARGUMENT,They lodged them in the portico; meantime
14408,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, stern, enjoin'd them haste, and, urged"
14409,ARGUMENT,"By sad necessity, they bore all out."
14410,ARGUMENT,"With sponges and with water, next, they cleansed"
14411,ARGUMENT,"The thrones and tables, while Telemachus"
14412,ARGUMENT,"Beesom'd the floor, Eumæus in that work"
14413,ARGUMENT,"Aiding him and the keeper of the beeves,"
14414,ARGUMENT,And those twelve damsels bearing forth the soil.
14415,ARGUMENT,"Thus, order giv'n to all within, they, next,"
14416,ARGUMENT,"Led forth the women, whom they shut between                      530"
14417,ARGUMENT,The scull'ry and the outer-wall in close
14418,ARGUMENT,"Durance, from which no pris'ner could escape,"
14419,ARGUMENT,And thus Telemachus discrete began.
14420,ARGUMENT,An honourable death is not for these
14421,ARGUMENT,"By my advice, who have so often heap'd"
14422,ARGUMENT,"Reproach on mine and on my mother's head,"
14423,ARGUMENT,And held lewd commerce with the suitor-train.
14424,ARGUMENT,"He said, and noosing a strong galley-rope"
14425,ARGUMENT,"To an huge column, led the cord around"
14426,ARGUMENT,"The spacious dome, suspended so aloft                            540"
14427,ARGUMENT,That none with quiv'ring feet might reach the floor.
14428,ARGUMENT,"As when a flight of doves ent'ring the copse,"
14429,ARGUMENT,"Or broad-wing'd thrushes, strike against the net"
14430,ARGUMENT,"Within, ill rest, entangled, there they find,"
14431,ARGUMENT,"So they, suspended by the neck, expired"
14432,ARGUMENT,All in one line together. Death abhorr'd!
14433,ARGUMENT,"With restless feet awhile they beat the air,"
14434,ARGUMENT,Then ceas'd. And now through vestibule and hall
14435,ARGUMENT,They led Melanthius forth. With ruthless steel
14436,ARGUMENT,"They pared away his ears and nose, pluck'd forth                 550"
14437,ARGUMENT,"His parts of shame, destin'd to feed the dogs,"
14438,ARGUMENT,"And, still indignant, lopp'd his hands and feet."
14439,ARGUMENT,"Then, laving each his feet and hands, they sought"
14440,ARGUMENT,"Again Ulysses; all their work was done,"
14441,ARGUMENT,And thus the Chief to Euryclea spake.
14442,ARGUMENT,"Bring blast-averting sulphur, nurse, bring fire!"
14443,ARGUMENT,That I may fumigate my walls; then bid
14444,ARGUMENT,"Penelope with her attendants down,"
14445,ARGUMENT,And summon all the women of her train.
14446,ARGUMENT,"But Euryclea, thus, his nurse, replied.                        560"
14447,ARGUMENT,My son! thou hast well said; yet will I first
14448,ARGUMENT,Serve thee with vest and mantle. Stand not here
14449,ARGUMENT,In thy own palace cloath'd with tatters foul
14450,ARGUMENT,And beggarly--she will abhor the sight.
14451,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus Ulysses wise return'd.
14452,ARGUMENT,Not so. Bring fire for fumigation first.
14453,ARGUMENT,He said; nor Euryclea his lov'd nurse
14454,ARGUMENT,"Longer delay'd, but sulphur brought and fire,"
14455,ARGUMENT,"When he with purifying steams, himself,"
14456,ARGUMENT,"Visited ev'ry part, the banquet-room,                            570"
14457,ARGUMENT,"The vestibule, the court. Ranging meantime"
14458,ARGUMENT,"His house magnificent, the matron call'd"
14459,ARGUMENT,"The women to attend their Lord in haste,"
14460,ARGUMENT,"And they attended, bearing each a torch."
14461,ARGUMENT,"Then gather'd they around him all, sincere"
14462,ARGUMENT,Welcoming his return; with close embrace
14463,ARGUMENT,"Enfolding him, each kiss'd his brows, and each"
14464,ARGUMENT,"His shoulders, and his hands lock'd fast in hers."
14465,ARGUMENT,"He, irresistible the impulse felt"
14466,ARGUMENT,"To sigh and weep, well recognizing all.                          580"

14601,ARGUMENT,"Ah, dearest nurse, sagacious as thou art,"
14602,ARGUMENT,Thou little know'st to scan the counsels wise
14603,ARGUMENT,Of the eternal Gods. But let us seek
14604,ARGUMENT,"My son, however, that I may behold"
14605,ARGUMENT,"The suitors dead, and him by whom they died."
14606,ARGUMENT,"So saying, she left her chamber, musing much"
14607,ARGUMENT,"In her descent, whether to interrogate"
14608,ARGUMENT,"Her Lord apart, or whether to imprint,"
14609,ARGUMENT,"At once, his hands with kisses and his brows."
14610,ARGUMENT,O'erpassing light the portal-step of stone                       100
14611,ARGUMENT,"She enter'd. He sat opposite, illumed"
14612,ARGUMENT,"By the hearth's sprightly blaze, and close before"
14613,ARGUMENT,"A pillar of the dome, waiting with eyes"
14614,ARGUMENT,"Downcast, till viewing him, his noble spouse"
14615,ARGUMENT,"Should speak to him; but she sat silent long,"
14616,ARGUMENT,Her faculties in mute amazement held.
14617,ARGUMENT,"By turns she riveted her eyes on his,"
14618,ARGUMENT,"And, seeing him so foul attired, by turns"
14619,ARGUMENT,She recognized him not; then spake her son
14620,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, and her silence thus reprov'd.                       110"
14621,ARGUMENT,My mother! ah my hapless and my most
14622,ARGUMENT,Obdurate mother! wherefore thus aloof
14623,ARGUMENT,"Shunn'st thou my father, neither at his side"
14624,ARGUMENT,"Sitting affectionate, nor utt'ring word?"
14625,ARGUMENT,Another wife lives not who could endure
14626,ARGUMENT,Such distance from her husband new-return'd
14627,ARGUMENT,"To his own country in the twentieth year,"
14628,ARGUMENT,After much hardship; but thy heart is still
14629,ARGUMENT,"As ever, less impressible than stone,"
14630,ARGUMENT,"To whom Penelope, discrete, replied.                           120"
14631,ARGUMENT,"I am all wonder, O my son; my soul"
14632,ARGUMENT,Is stunn'd within me; pow'r to speak to him
14633,ARGUMENT,"Or to interrogate him have I none,"
14634,ARGUMENT,Or ev'n to look on him; but if indeed
14635,ARGUMENT,"He be Ulysses, and have reach'd his home,"
14636,ARGUMENT,"I shall believe it soon, by proof convinced"
14637,ARGUMENT,Of signs known only to himself and me.
14638,ARGUMENT,"She said; then smiled the Hero toil-inured,"
14639,ARGUMENT,And in wing'd accents thus spake to his son.
14640,ARGUMENT,"Leave thou, Telemachus, thy mother here                        130"
14641,ARGUMENT,To sift and prove me; she will know me soon
14642,ARGUMENT,More certainly; she sees me ill-attired
14643,ARGUMENT,"And squalid now; therefore she shews me scorn,"
14644,ARGUMENT,And no belief hath yet that I am he.
14645,ARGUMENT,"But we have need, thou and myself, of deep"
14646,ARGUMENT,Deliberation. If a man have slain
14647,ARGUMENT,"One only citizen, who leaves behind"
14648,ARGUMENT,"Few interested to avenge his death,"
14649,ARGUMENT,"Yet, flying, he forsakes both friends and home;"
14650,ARGUMENT,But we have slain the noblest Princes far                        140
14651,ARGUMENT,"Of Ithaca, on whom our city most"
14652,ARGUMENT,"Depended; therefore, I advise thee, think!"
14653,ARGUMENT,"Him, prudent, then answer'd Telemachus."
14654,ARGUMENT,"Be that thy care, my father! for report"
14655,ARGUMENT,"Proclaims _thee_ shrewdest of mankind, with whom"
14656,ARGUMENT,In ingenuity may none compare.
14657,ARGUMENT,Lead thou; to follow thee shall be our part
14658,ARGUMENT,"With prompt alacrity; nor shall, I judge,"
14659,ARGUMENT,Courage be wanting to our utmost force.
14660,ARGUMENT,"Thus then replied Ulysses, ever-wise.                          150"
14661,ARGUMENT,To me the safest counsel and the best
14662,ARGUMENT,"Seems this. First wash yourselves, and put ye on"
14663,ARGUMENT,"Your tunics; bid ye, next, the maidens take"
14664,ARGUMENT,"Their best attire, and let the bard divine"
14665,ARGUMENT,"Harping melodious play a sportive dance,"
14666,ARGUMENT,"That, whether passenger or neighbour near,"
14667,ARGUMENT,All may imagine nuptials held within.
14668,ARGUMENT,So shall not loud report that we have slain
14669,ARGUMENT,"All those, alarm the city, till we gain"
14670,ARGUMENT,"Our woods and fields, where, once arriv'd, such plans            160"
14671,ARGUMENT,"We will devise, as Jove shall deign to inspire."
14672,ARGUMENT,"He spake, and all, obedient, in the bath"
14673,ARGUMENT,"First laved themselves, then put their tunics on;"
14674,ARGUMENT,"The damsels also dress'd, and the sweet bard,"
14675,ARGUMENT,"Harping melodious, kindled strong desire"
14676,ARGUMENT,"In all, of jocund song and graceful dance."
14677,ARGUMENT,The palace under all its vaulted roof
14678,ARGUMENT,Remurmur'd to the feet of sportive youths
14679,ARGUMENT,"And cinctured maidens, while no few abroad,"
14680,ARGUMENT,"Hearing such revelry within, remark'd--                          170"
14681,ARGUMENT,"The Queen with many wooers, weds at last."
14682,ARGUMENT,Ah fickle and unworthy fair! too frail
14683,ARGUMENT,Always to keep inviolate the house
14684,ARGUMENT,"Of her first Lord, and wait for his return."
14685,ARGUMENT,So spake the people; but they little knew
14686,ARGUMENT,"What had befall'n. Eurynome, meantime,"
14687,ARGUMENT,With bath and unction serv'd the illustrious Chief
14688,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, and he saw himself attired"
14689,ARGUMENT,Royally once again in his own house.
14690,ARGUMENT,"Then, Pallas over all his features shed                          180"
14691,ARGUMENT,"Superior beauty, dignified his form"
14692,ARGUMENT,"With added amplitude, and pour'd his curls"
14693,ARGUMENT,Like hyacinthine flow'rs down from his brows.
14694,ARGUMENT,As when some artist by Minerva made
14695,ARGUMENT,"And Vulcan, wise to execute all tasks"
14696,ARGUMENT,"Ingenious, borders silver with a wreath"
14697,ARGUMENT,"Of gold, accomplishing a graceful work,"
14698,ARGUMENT,Such grace the Goddess o'er his ample chest
14699,ARGUMENT,"Copious diffused, and o'er his manly brows."
14700,ARGUMENT,"He, godlike, stepping from the bath, resumed                     190"
14701,ARGUMENT,"His former seat magnificent, and sat"
14702,ARGUMENT,"Opposite to the Queen, to whom he said."
14703,ARGUMENT,Penelope! the Gods to thee have giv'n
14704,ARGUMENT,"Of all thy sex, the most obdurate heart."
14705,ARGUMENT,Another wife lives not who could endure
14706,ARGUMENT,Such distance from her husband new-return'd
14707,ARGUMENT,"To his own country in the twentieth year,"
14708,ARGUMENT,"After such hardship. But prepare me, nurse,"
14709,ARGUMENT,"A bed, for solitary I must sleep,"
14710,ARGUMENT,"Since she is iron, and feels not for me.                         200"
14711,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then prudent Penelope.
14712,ARGUMENT,"I neither magnify thee, sir! nor yet"
14713,ARGUMENT,"Depreciate thee, nor is my wonder such"
14714,ARGUMENT,"As hurries me at once into thy arms,"
14715,ARGUMENT,"Though my remembrance perfectly retains,"
14716,ARGUMENT,"Such as he was, Ulysses, when he sail'd"
14717,ARGUMENT,"On board his bark from Ithaca--Go, nurse,"
14718,ARGUMENT,"Prepare his bed, but not within the walls"
14719,ARGUMENT,Of his own chamber built with his own hands.
14720,ARGUMENT,"Spread it without, and spread it well with warm                  210"
14721,ARGUMENT,"Mantles, with fleeces, and with richest rugs."
14722,ARGUMENT,"So spake she, proving him,[108] and not untouch'd"
14723,ARGUMENT,"With anger at that word, thus he replied."
14724,ARGUMENT,"Penelope, that order grates my ear."
14725,ARGUMENT,Who hath displaced my bed? The task were hard
14726,ARGUMENT,E'en to an artist; other than a God
14727,ARGUMENT,"None might with ease remove it; as for man,"
14728,ARGUMENT,It might defy the stoutest in his prime
14729,ARGUMENT,"Of youth, to heave it to a different spot."
14730,ARGUMENT,"For in that bed elaborate, a sign,                               220"
14731,ARGUMENT,A special sign consists; I was myself
14732,ARGUMENT,The artificer; I fashion'd it alone.
14733,ARGUMENT,Within the court a leafy olive grew
14734,ARGUMENT,"Lofty, luxuriant, pillar-like in girth."
14735,ARGUMENT,"Around this tree I built, with massy stones"
14736,ARGUMENT,"Cemented close, my chamber, roof'd it o'er,"
14737,ARGUMENT,And hung the glutinated portals on.
14738,ARGUMENT,"I lopp'd the ample foliage and the boughs,"
14739,ARGUMENT,"And sev'ring near the root its solid bole,"
14740,ARGUMENT,"Smooth'd all the rugged stump with skilful hand,                 230"
14741,ARGUMENT,And wrought it to a pedestal well squared
14742,ARGUMENT,"And modell'd by the line. I wimbled, next,"
14743,ARGUMENT,"The frame throughout, and from the olive-stump"
14744,ARGUMENT,"Beginning, fashion'd the whole bed above"
14745,ARGUMENT,"Till all was finish'd, plated o'er with gold,"
14746,ARGUMENT,"With silver, and with ivory, and beneath"
14747,ARGUMENT,Close interlaced with purple cordage strong.
14748,ARGUMENT,Such sign I give thee. But if still it stand
14749,ARGUMENT,"Unmoved, or if some other, sev'ring sheer"
14750,ARGUMENT,"The olive from its bottom, have displaced                        240"
14751,ARGUMENT,My bed--that matter is best known to thee.
14752,ARGUMENT,"He ceas'd; she, conscious of the sign so plain"
14753,ARGUMENT,"Giv'n by Ulysses, heard with flutt'ring heart"
14754,ARGUMENT,And fault'ring knees that proof. Weeping she ran
14755,ARGUMENT,"Direct toward him, threw her arms around"
14756,ARGUMENT,"The Hero, kiss'd his forehead, and replied."
14757,ARGUMENT,Ah my Ulysses! pardon me--frown not--
14758,ARGUMENT,"Thou, who at other times hast ever shewn"
14759,ARGUMENT,Superior wisdom! all our griefs have flow'd
14760,ARGUMENT,From the Gods' will; they envied us the bliss                    250
14761,ARGUMENT,Of undivided union sweet enjoy'd
14762,ARGUMENT,"Through life, from early youth to latest age."
14763,ARGUMENT,No. Be not angry now; pardon the fault
14764,ARGUMENT,"That I embraced thee not as soon as seen,"
14765,ARGUMENT,For horror hath not ceased to overwhelm
14766,ARGUMENT,"My soul, lest some false alien should, perchance,"
14767,ARGUMENT,"Beguile me, for our house draws num'rous such."
14768,ARGUMENT,"Jove's daughter, Argive Helen, ne'er had given"
14769,ARGUMENT,"Free entertainment to a stranger's love,"
14770,ARGUMENT,Had she foreknown that the heroic sons                           260
14771,ARGUMENT,Of Greece would bring her to her home again.
14772,ARGUMENT,"But heav'n incited her to that offence,"
14773,ARGUMENT,"Who never, else, had even in her thought"
14774,ARGUMENT,"Harbour'd the foul enormity, from which"
14775,ARGUMENT,Originated even our distress.
14776,ARGUMENT,"But now, since evident thou hast described"
14777,ARGUMENT,"Our bed, which never mortal yet beheld,"
14778,ARGUMENT,Ourselves except and Actoris my own
14779,ARGUMENT,"Attendant, giv'n me when I left my home"
14780,ARGUMENT,"By good Icarius, and who kept the door,                          270"
14781,ARGUMENT,"Though hard to be convinced, at last I yield."
14782,ARGUMENT,"So saying, she awaken'd in his soul"
14783,ARGUMENT,Pity and grief; and folding in his arms
14784,ARGUMENT,"His blameless consort beautiful, he wept."
14785,ARGUMENT,"Welcome as land appears to those who swim,"
14786,ARGUMENT,Whose gallant bark Neptune with rolling waves
14787,ARGUMENT,"And stormy winds hath sunk in the wide sea,"
14788,ARGUMENT,"A mariner or two, perchance, escape"
14789,ARGUMENT,"The foamy flood, and, swimming, reach the land,"
14790,ARGUMENT,"Weary indeed, and with incrusted brine                           280"
14791,ARGUMENT,"All rough, but oh, how glad to climb the coast!"
14792,ARGUMENT,"So welcome in her eyes Ulysses seem'd,"
14793,ARGUMENT,"Around whose neck winding her snowy arms,"
14794,ARGUMENT,She clung as she would loose him never more.
14795,ARGUMENT,Thus had they wept till rosy-finger'd morn
14796,ARGUMENT,"Had found them weeping, but Minerva check'd"
14797,ARGUMENT,"Night's almost finish'd course, and held, meantime,"
14798,ARGUMENT,"The golden dawn close pris'ner in the Deep,"
14799,ARGUMENT,"Forbidding her to lead her coursers forth,"
14800,ARGUMENT,Lampus and Phaëton that furnish light                            290
14801,ARGUMENT,"To all the earth, and join them to the yoke."
14802,ARGUMENT,"Then thus, Ulysses to Penelope."
14803,ARGUMENT,My love; we have not yet attain'd the close
14804,ARGUMENT,"Of all our sufferings, but unmeasured toil"
14805,ARGUMENT,"Arduous remains, which I must still atchieve."
14806,ARGUMENT,For so the spirit of the Theban seer
14807,ARGUMENT,"Inform'd me, on that day, when to enquire"
14808,ARGUMENT,Of mine and of my people's safe return
14809,ARGUMENT,I journey'd down to Pluto's drear abode.
14810,ARGUMENT,"But let us hence to bed, there to enjoy                          300"
14811,ARGUMENT,"Tranquil repose. My love, make no delay."
14812,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then prudent Penelope.
14813,ARGUMENT,Thou shalt to bed at whatsoever time
14814,ARGUMENT,"Thy soul desires, since the immortal Gods"
14815,ARGUMENT,Give thee to me and to thy home again.
14816,ARGUMENT,"But, thou hast spoken from the seer of Thebes"
14817,ARGUMENT,Of arduous toils yet unperform'd; declare
14818,ARGUMENT,"What toils? Thou wilt disclose them, as I judge,"
14819,ARGUMENT,"Hereafter, and why not disclose them now?"
14820,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied.                           310"
14821,ARGUMENT,Ah conversant with woe! why would'st thou learn
14822,ARGUMENT,That tale? but I will tell it thee at large.
14823,ARGUMENT,"Thou wilt not hear with joy, nor shall myself"
14824,ARGUMENT,With joy rehearse it; for he bade me seek
14825,ARGUMENT,"City after city, bearing, as I go,"
14826,ARGUMENT,"A shapely oar, till I shall find, at length,"
14827,ARGUMENT,"A people who the sea know not, nor eat"
14828,ARGUMENT,Food salted; they trim galley crimson-prow'd
14829,ARGUMENT,"Have ne'er beheld, nor yet smooth-shaven oar"
14830,ARGUMENT,With which the vessel wing'd scuds o'er the waves.               320
14831,ARGUMENT,"He gave me also this authentic sign,"
14832,ARGUMENT,Which I will tell thee. In what place soe'er
14833,ARGUMENT,I chance to meet a trav'ler who shall name
14834,ARGUMENT,"The oar on my broad shoulder borne, a van;[109]"
14835,ARGUMENT,"He bade me, planting it on the same spot,"
14836,ARGUMENT,"Worship the King of Ocean with a bull,"
14837,ARGUMENT,"A ram, and a lascivious boar, then seek"
14838,ARGUMENT,"My home again, and sacrifice at home"
14839,ARGUMENT,An hecatomb to the immortal Gods
14840,ARGUMENT,Inhabitants of the expanse above.                                330
14841,ARGUMENT,"So shall I die, at length, the gentlest death"
14842,ARGUMENT,"Remote from Ocean; it shall find me late,"
14843,ARGUMENT,"In soft serenity of age, the Chief"
14844,ARGUMENT,Of a blest people.--Thus he prophesied.
14845,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then Penelope discrete.
14846,ARGUMENT,If heav'n appoint thee in old age a lot
14847,ARGUMENT,"More tranquil, hope thence springs of thy escape"
14848,ARGUMENT,Some future day from all thy threaten'd woes.
14849,ARGUMENT,Such was their mutual conf'rence sweet; meantime
14850,ARGUMENT,Eurynome and Euryclea dress'd                                    340
14851,ARGUMENT,"Their bed by light of the clear torch, and when"
14852,ARGUMENT,"Dispatchful they had spread it broad and deep,"
14853,ARGUMENT,The ancient nurse to her own bed retired.
14854,ARGUMENT,"Then came Eurynome, to whom in trust"
14855,ARGUMENT,"The chambers appertain'd, and with a torch"
14856,ARGUMENT,Conducted them to rest; she introduced
14857,ARGUMENT,"The happy pair, and went; transported they"
14858,ARGUMENT,"To rites connubial intermitted long,"
14859,ARGUMENT,"And now recover'd, gave themselves again.[110]"
14860,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, the Prince, the herdsman, and the good                 350"
14861,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus, giving rest each to his feet,"
14862,ARGUMENT,Ceased from the dance; they made the women cease
14863,ARGUMENT,"Also, and to their sev'ral chambers all"
14864,ARGUMENT,Within the twilight edifice repair'd.
14865,ARGUMENT,"At length, with conjugal endearment both"
14866,ARGUMENT,"Satiate, Ulysses tasted and his spouse"
14867,ARGUMENT,"The sweets of mutual converse. She rehearsed,"
14868,ARGUMENT,"Noblest of women, all her num'rous woes"
14869,ARGUMENT,"Beneath that roof sustain'd, while she beheld"
14870,ARGUMENT,"The profligacy of the suitor-throng,                             360"
14871,ARGUMENT,Who in their wooing had consumed his herds
14872,ARGUMENT,"And fatted flocks, and drawn his vessels dry;"
14873,ARGUMENT,"While brave Ulysses, in his turn, to her"
14874,ARGUMENT,"Related his successes and escapes,"
14875,ARGUMENT,And his afflictions also; he told her all;
14876,ARGUMENT,"She listen'd charm'd, nor slumber on his eyes"
14877,ARGUMENT,"Fell once, or ere he had rehearsed the whole."
14878,ARGUMENT,"Beginning, he discoursed, how, at the first"
14879,ARGUMENT,"He conquer'd in Ciconia, and thence reach'd"
14880,ARGUMENT,The fruitful shores of the Lotophagi;                            370
14881,ARGUMENT,"The Cyclops' deeds he told her next, and how"
14882,ARGUMENT,He well avenged on him his slaughter'd friends
14883,ARGUMENT,"Whom, pitiless, the monster had devour'd."
14884,ARGUMENT,"How to the isle of Æolus he came,"
14885,ARGUMENT,"Who welcom'd him and safe dismiss'd him thence,"
14886,ARGUMENT,Although not destin'd to regain so soon
14887,ARGUMENT,His native land; for o'er the fishy deep
14888,ARGUMENT,Loud tempests snatch'd him sighing back again.
14889,ARGUMENT,"How, also at Telepylus he arrived,"
14890,ARGUMENT,"Town of the Læstrygonians, who destroyed                         380"
14891,ARGUMENT,"His ships with all their mariners, his own"
14892,ARGUMENT,"Except, who in his sable bark escaped."
14893,ARGUMENT,"Of guileful Circe too he spake, deep-skill'd"
14894,ARGUMENT,"In various artifice, and how he reach'd"
14895,ARGUMENT,"With sails and oars the squalid realms of death,"
14896,ARGUMENT,Desirous to consult the prophet there
14897,ARGUMENT,"Theban Tiresias, and how there he view'd"
14898,ARGUMENT,"All his companions, and the mother bland"
14899,ARGUMENT,"Who bare him, nourisher of his infant years."
14900,ARGUMENT,"How, next he heard the Sirens in one strain                      390"
14901,ARGUMENT,"All chiming sweet, and how he reach'd the rocks"
14902,ARGUMENT,"Erratic, Scylla and Charybdis dire,"
14903,ARGUMENT,Which none secure from injury may pass.
14904,ARGUMENT,"Then, how the partners of his voyage slew"
14905,ARGUMENT,"The Sun's own beeves, and how the Thund'rer Jove"
14906,ARGUMENT,"Hurl'd down his smoky bolts into his bark,"
14907,ARGUMENT,"Depriving him at once of all his crew,"
14908,ARGUMENT,"Whose dreadful fate he yet, himself, escaped."
14909,ARGUMENT,"How to Ogygia's isle he came, where dwelt"
14910,ARGUMENT,"The nymph Calypso, who, enamour'd, wish'd                        400"
14911,ARGUMENT,"To espouse him, and within her spacious grot"
14912,ARGUMENT,"Detain'd, and fed, and promis'd him a life"
14913,ARGUMENT,"Exempt for ever from the sap of age,"
14914,ARGUMENT,"But him moved not. How, also, he arrived"
14915,ARGUMENT,"After much toil, on the Phæacian coast,"
14916,ARGUMENT,"Where ev'ry heart revered him as a God,"
14917,ARGUMENT,"And whence, enriching him with brass and gold,"
14918,ARGUMENT,"And costly raiment first, they sent him home."
14919,ARGUMENT,"At this last word, oblivious slumber sweet"
14920,ARGUMENT,"Fell on him, dissipating all his cares.                          410"
14921,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, Minerva, Goddess azure-eyed,"
14922,ARGUMENT,"On other thoughts intent, soon as she deem'd"
14923,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses with connubial joys sufficed,"
14924,ARGUMENT,"And with sweet sleep, at once from Ocean rous'd"
14925,ARGUMENT,The golden-axled chariot of the morn
14926,ARGUMENT,To illumine earth. Then from his fleecy couch
14927,ARGUMENT,"The Hero sprang, and thus his spouse enjoined."
14928,ARGUMENT,Oh consort dear! already we have striv'n
14929,ARGUMENT,"Against our lot, till wearied with the toil,"
14930,ARGUMENT,"My painful absence, thou with ceaseless tears                    420"
14931,ARGUMENT,"Deploring, and myself in deep distress"

14935,ARGUMENT,"Met once again, watch thou and keep secure"
14936,ARGUMENT,"All my domestic treasures, and ere long"
14937,ARGUMENT,I will replace my num'rous sheep destroy'd
14938,ARGUMENT,"By those imperious suitors, and the Greeks"
14939,ARGUMENT,Shall add yet others till my folds be fill'd.
14940,ARGUMENT,But to the woodlands go I now--to see                            430
14941,ARGUMENT,"My noble father, who for my sake mourns"
14942,ARGUMENT,"Continual; as for thee, my love, although"
14943,ARGUMENT,"I know thee wise, I give thee thus in charge."
14944,ARGUMENT,"The sun no sooner shall ascend, than fame"
14945,ARGUMENT,"Shall wide divulge the deed that I have done,"
14946,ARGUMENT,Slaying the suitors under my own roof.
14947,ARGUMENT,"Thou, therefore, with thy maidens, sit retired"
14948,ARGUMENT,"In thy own chamber at the palace-top,"
14949,ARGUMENT,"Nor question ask, nor, curious, look abroad."

14952,ARGUMENT,"Eumæus and the herdsman too, and bade"
14953,ARGUMENT,All take their martial weapons in their hand.
14954,ARGUMENT,"Not disobedient they, as he enjoin'd,"
14955,ARGUMENT,"Put armour on, and issued from the gates"

15090,ARGUMENT,"The burial rites of many an Hero bold,"
15091,ARGUMENT,"When, on the death of some great Chief, the youths"
15092,ARGUMENT,"Girding their loins anticipate the prize,"
15093,ARGUMENT,"But sight of those with wonder fill'd me most,"
15094,ARGUMENT,So glorious past all others were the games
15095,ARGUMENT,"By silver-footed Thetis giv'n for thee,"
15096,ARGUMENT,For thou wast ever favour'd of the Gods.
15097,ARGUMENT,"Thus, hast thou not, Achilles! although dead,                    110"
15098,ARGUMENT,"Foregone thy glory, but thy fair report"
15099,ARGUMENT,Is universal among all mankind;
15100,ARGUMENT,"But, as for me, what recompense had I,"
15101,ARGUMENT,"My warfare closed? for whom, at my return,"
15102,ARGUMENT,Jove framed such dire destruction by the hands
15103,ARGUMENT,Of fell Ægisthus and my murth'ress wife.
15104,ARGUMENT,"Thus, mutual, they conferr'd; meantime approach'd,"
15105,ARGUMENT,"Swift messenger of heav'n, the Argicide,"
15106,ARGUMENT,Conducting thither all the shades of those
15107,ARGUMENT,Slain by Ulysses. At that sight amazed                           120
15108,ARGUMENT,Both moved toward them. Agamemnon's shade
15109,ARGUMENT,"Knew well Amphimedon, for he had been"
15110,ARGUMENT,"Erewhile his father's guest in Ithaca,"
15111,ARGUMENT,And thus the spirit of Atreus' son began.
15112,ARGUMENT,"Amphimedon! by what disastrous chance,"
15113,ARGUMENT,"Coœvals as ye seem, and of an air"
15114,ARGUMENT,"Distinguish'd all, descend ye to the Deeps?"
15115,ARGUMENT,For not the chosen youths of a whole town
15116,ARGUMENT,Should form a nobler band. Perish'd ye sunk
15117,ARGUMENT,Amid vast billows and rude tempests raised                       130
15118,ARGUMENT,By Neptune's pow'r? or on dry land through force
15119,ARGUMENT,"Of hostile multitudes, while cutting off"
15120,ARGUMENT,"Beeves from the herd, or driving flocks away?"
15121,ARGUMENT,Or fighting for your city and your wives?
15122,ARGUMENT,Resolve me? I was once a guest of yours.
15123,ARGUMENT,Remember'st not what time at your abode
15124,ARGUMENT,"With godlike Menelaus I arrived,"
15125,ARGUMENT,That we might win Ulysses with his fleet
15126,ARGUMENT,To follow us to Troy? scarce we prevail'd
15127,ARGUMENT,"At last to gain the city-waster Chief,                           140"
15128,ARGUMENT,"And, after all, consumed a whole month more"
15129,ARGUMENT,The wide sea traversing from side to side.
15130,ARGUMENT,To whom the spirit of Amphimedon.
15131,ARGUMENT,"Illustrious Agamemnon, King of men!"
15132,ARGUMENT,"All this I bear in mind, and will rehearse"
15133,ARGUMENT,The manner of our most disastrous end.
15134,ARGUMENT,"Believing brave Ulysses lost, we woo'd"
15135,ARGUMENT,Meantime his wife; she our detested suit
15136,ARGUMENT,"Would neither ratify nor yet refuse,"
15137,ARGUMENT,"But, planning for us a tremendous death,                         150"
15138,ARGUMENT,"This novel stratagem, at last, devised."
15139,ARGUMENT,"Beginning, in her own recess, a web"
15140,ARGUMENT,"Of slend'rest thread, and of a length and breadth"
15141,ARGUMENT,"Unusual, thus the suitors she address'd."
15142,ARGUMENT,"Princes, my suitors! since the noble Chief"
15143,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses is no more, enforce not yet"
15144,ARGUMENT,My nuptials; wait till I shall finish first
15145,ARGUMENT,A fun'ral robe (lest all my threads decay)
15146,ARGUMENT,"Which for the ancient Hero I prepare,"
15147,ARGUMENT,"Laertes, looking for the mournful hour                           160"
15148,ARGUMENT,When fate shall snatch him to eternal rest;
15149,ARGUMENT,"Else, I the censure dread of all my sex,"
15150,ARGUMENT,"Should he so wealthy, want at last a shroud."
15151,ARGUMENT,"So spake the Queen; we, unsuspicious all,"
15152,ARGUMENT,"With her request complied. Thenceforth, all day"
15153,ARGUMENT,"She wove the ample web, and by the aid"
15154,ARGUMENT,Of torches ravell'd it again at night.
15155,ARGUMENT,Three years she thus by artifice our suit
15156,ARGUMENT,"Eluded safe, but when the fourth arrived,"
15157,ARGUMENT,"And the same season, after many moons                            170"
15158,ARGUMENT,"And fleeting days, return'd, a damsel then"
15159,ARGUMENT,"Of her attendants, conscious of the fraud,"
15160,ARGUMENT,"Reveal'd it, and we found her pulling loose"
15161,ARGUMENT,"The splendid web. Thus, through constraint, at length,"
15162,ARGUMENT,"She finish'd it, and in her own despight."
15163,ARGUMENT,"But when the Queen produced, at length, her work"
15164,ARGUMENT,"Finish'd, new-blanch'd, bright as the sun or moon,"
15165,ARGUMENT,"Then came Ulysses, by some adverse God"
15166,ARGUMENT,"Conducted, to a cottage on the verge"
15167,ARGUMENT,"Of his own fields, in which his swine-herd dwells;               180"
15168,ARGUMENT,There also the illustrious Hero's son
15169,ARGUMENT,"Arrived soon after, in his sable bark"
15170,ARGUMENT,"From sandy Pylus borne; they, plotting both"
15171,ARGUMENT,"A dreadful death for all the suitors, sought"
15172,ARGUMENT,"Our glorious city, but Ulysses last,"
15173,ARGUMENT,And first Telemachus. The father came
15174,ARGUMENT,"Conducted by his swine-herd, and attired"
15175,ARGUMENT,"In tatters foul; a mendicant he seem'd,"
15176,ARGUMENT,"Time-worn, and halted on a staff. So clad,"
15177,ARGUMENT,"And ent'ring on the sudden, he escaped                           190"
15178,ARGUMENT,"All knowledge even of our eldest there,"
15179,ARGUMENT,And we reviled and smote him; he although
15180,ARGUMENT,"Beneath his own roof smitten and reproach'd,"
15181,ARGUMENT,"With patience suffer'd it awhile, but roused"
15182,ARGUMENT,By inspiration of Jove Ægis-arm'd
15183,ARGUMENT,"At length, in concert with his son convey'd"
15184,ARGUMENT,"To his own chamber his resplendent arms,"
15185,ARGUMENT,"There lodg'd them safe, and barr'd the massy doors"
15186,ARGUMENT,"Then, in his subtlety he bade the Queen"
15187,ARGUMENT,A contest institute with bow and rings                           200
15188,ARGUMENT,"Between the hapless suitors, whence ensued"
15189,ARGUMENT,Slaughter to all. No suitor there had pow'r
15190,ARGUMENT,To overcome the stubborn bow that mock'd
15191,ARGUMENT,All our attempts; and when the weapon huge
15192,ARGUMENT,"At length was offer'd to Ulysses' hands,"
15193,ARGUMENT,With clamour'd menaces we bade the swain
15194,ARGUMENT,"Withhold it from him, plead he as he might;"
15195,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus alone with loud command,"
15196,ARGUMENT,"Bade give it him, and the illustrious Chief"
15197,ARGUMENT,"Receiving in his hand the bow, with ease                         210"
15198,ARGUMENT,"Bent it, and sped a shaft through all the rings."
15199,ARGUMENT,"Then, springing to the portal steps, he pour'd"
15200,ARGUMENT,"The arrows forth, peer'd terrible around,"
15201,ARGUMENT,"Pierced King Antinoüs, and, aiming sure"
15202,ARGUMENT,"His deadly darts, pierced others after him,"
15203,ARGUMENT,Till in one common carnage heap'd we lay.
15204,ARGUMENT,"Some God, as plain appear'd, vouchsafed them aid,"
15205,ARGUMENT,"Such ardour urged them, and with such dispatch"
15206,ARGUMENT,They slew us on all sides; hideous were heard
15207,ARGUMENT,The groans of dying men fell'd to the earth                      220
15208,ARGUMENT,"With head-strokes rude, and the floor swam with blood."
15209,ARGUMENT,"Such, royal Agamemnon! was the fate"
15210,ARGUMENT,"By which we perish'd, all whose bodies lie"
15211,ARGUMENT,"Unburied still, and in Ulysses' house,"
15212,ARGUMENT,For tidings none have yet our friends alarm'd
15213,ARGUMENT,"And kindred, who might cleanse from sable gore"
15214,ARGUMENT,"Our clotted wounds, and mourn us on the bier,"
15215,ARGUMENT,Which are the rightful privilege of the dead.
15216,ARGUMENT,"Him answer'd, then, the shade of Atreus' son."
15217,ARGUMENT,Oh happy offspring of Laertes! shrewd                            230
15218,ARGUMENT,Ulysses! matchless valour thou hast shewn
15219,ARGUMENT,Recov'ring thus thy wife; nor less appears
15220,ARGUMENT,"The virtue of Icarius' daughter wise,"
15221,ARGUMENT,"The chaste Penelope, so faithful found"
15222,ARGUMENT,"To her Ulysses, husband of her youth."
15223,ARGUMENT,"His glory, by superior merit earn'd,"
15224,ARGUMENT,"Shall never die, and the immortal Gods"
15225,ARGUMENT,Shall make Penelope a theme of song
15226,ARGUMENT,Delightful in the ears of all mankind.
15227,ARGUMENT,"Not such was Clytemnestra, daughter vile                         240"
15228,ARGUMENT,"Of Tyndarus; she shed her husband's blood,"
15229,ARGUMENT,And shall be chronicled in song a wife
15230,ARGUMENT,"Of hateful memory, by whose offence"
15231,ARGUMENT,Even the virtuous of her sex are shamed.
15232,ARGUMENT,"Thus they, beneath the vaulted roof obscure"
15233,ARGUMENT,"Of Pluto's house, conferring mutual stood."
15234,ARGUMENT,"Meantime, descending from the city-gates,"
15235,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, by his son and by his swains"
15236,ARGUMENT,"Follow'd, arrived at the delightful farm"
15237,ARGUMENT,Which old Laertes had with strenuous toil                        250
15238,ARGUMENT,Himself long since acquired. There stood his house
15239,ARGUMENT,Encompass'd by a bow'r in which the hinds
15240,ARGUMENT,"Who served and pleased him, ate, and sat, and slept."
15241,ARGUMENT,"An ancient woman, a Sicilian, dwelt"
15242,ARGUMENT,"There also, who in that sequester'd spot"
15243,ARGUMENT,Attended diligent her aged Lord.
15244,ARGUMENT,Then thus Ulysses to his followers spake.
15245,ARGUMENT,"Haste now, and, ent'ring, slay ye of the swine"
15246,ARGUMENT,"The best for our regale; myself, the while,"
15247,ARGUMENT,"Will prove my father, if his eye hath still                      260"
15248,ARGUMENT,"Discernment of me, or if absence long"
15249,ARGUMENT,Have worn the knowledge of me from his mind.
15250,ARGUMENT,"He said, and gave into his servants' care"
15251,ARGUMENT,"His arms; they swift proceeded to the house,"
15252,ARGUMENT,And to the fruitful grove himself as swift
15253,ARGUMENT,To prove his father. Down he went at once
15254,ARGUMENT,"Into the spacious garden-plot, but found"
15255,ARGUMENT,"Nor Dolius there, nor any of his sons"
15256,ARGUMENT,"Or servants; they were occupied elsewhere,"
15257,ARGUMENT,"And, with the ancient hind himself, employ'd                     270"
15258,ARGUMENT,Collecting thorns with which to fence the grove.
15259,ARGUMENT,In that umbrageous spot he found alone
15260,ARGUMENT,"Laertes, with his hoe clearing a plant;"
15261,ARGUMENT,"Sordid his tunic was, with many a patch"
15262,ARGUMENT,"Mended unseemly; leathern were his greaves,"
15263,ARGUMENT,"Thong-tied and also patch'd, a frail defence"
15264,ARGUMENT,"Against sharp thorns, while gloves secured his hands"
15265,ARGUMENT,"From briar-points, and on his head he bore"
15266,ARGUMENT,"A goat-skin casque, nourishing hopeless woe."
15267,ARGUMENT,No sooner then the Hero toil-inured                              280
15268,ARGUMENT,"Saw him age-worn and wretched, than he paused"
15269,ARGUMENT,Beneath a lofty pear-tree's shade to weep.
15270,ARGUMENT,"There standing much he mused, whether, at once,"
15271,ARGUMENT,"Kissing and clasping in his arms his sire,"
15272,ARGUMENT,"To tell him all, by what means he had reach'd"
15273,ARGUMENT,"His native country, or to prove him first."
15274,ARGUMENT,"At length, he chose as his best course, with words"
15275,ARGUMENT,"Of seeming strangeness to accost his ear,"
15276,ARGUMENT,"And, with that purpose, moved direct toward him."
15277,ARGUMENT,"He, stooping low, loosen'd the earth around                      290"
15278,ARGUMENT,"A garden-plant, when his illustrious son"
15279,ARGUMENT,"Now, standing close beside him, thus began."
15280,ARGUMENT,Old sir! thou art no novice in these toils
15281,ARGUMENT,"Of culture, but thy garden thrives; I mark"
15282,ARGUMENT,"In all thy ground no plant, fig, olive, vine,"
15283,ARGUMENT,Pear-tree or flow'r-bed suff'ring through neglect.
15284,ARGUMENT,But let it not offend thee if I say
15285,ARGUMENT,"That thou neglect'st thyself, at the same time"
15286,ARGUMENT,"Oppress'd with age, sun-parch'd and ill-attired."
15287,ARGUMENT,"Not for thy inactivity, methinks,                                300"
15288,ARGUMENT,"Thy master slights thee thus, nor speaks thy form"
15289,ARGUMENT,Or thy surpassing stature servile aught
15290,ARGUMENT,"In thee, but thou resemblest more a King."
15291,ARGUMENT,"Yes--thou resemblest one who, bathed and fed,"
15292,ARGUMENT,Should softly sleep; such is the claim of age.
15293,ARGUMENT,"But tell me true--for whom labourest thou,"
15294,ARGUMENT,"And whose this garden? answer me beside,"
15295,ARGUMENT,For I would learn; have I indeed arrived
15296,ARGUMENT,"In Ithaca, as one whom here I met"
15297,ARGUMENT,"Ev'n now assured me, but who seem'd a man                        310"
15298,ARGUMENT,"Not overwise, refusing both to hear"
15299,ARGUMENT,"My questions, and to answer when I ask'd"
15300,ARGUMENT,Concerning one in other days my guest
15301,ARGUMENT,"And friend, if he have still his being here,"
15302,ARGUMENT,Or have deceas'd and journey'd to the shades.
15303,ARGUMENT,For I will tell thee; therefore mark. Long since
15304,ARGUMENT,"A stranger reach'd my house in my own land,"
15305,ARGUMENT,"Whom I with hospitality receiv'd,"
15306,ARGUMENT,Nor ever sojourn'd foreigner with me
15307,ARGUMENT,"Whom I lov'd more. He was by birth, he said,                     320"
15308,ARGUMENT,"Ithacan, and Laertes claim'd his sire,"
15309,ARGUMENT,Son of Arcesias. Introducing him
15310,ARGUMENT,"Beneath my roof, I entertain'd him well,"
15311,ARGUMENT,And proved by gifts his welcome at my board.
15312,ARGUMENT,"I gave him seven talents of wrought gold,"
15313,ARGUMENT,"A goblet, argent all, with flow'rs emboss'd,"
15314,ARGUMENT,"Twelve single cloaks, twelve carpets, mantles twelve"
15315,ARGUMENT,"Of brightest lustre, with as many vests,"
15316,ARGUMENT,"And added four fair damsels, whom he chose"
15317,ARGUMENT,"Himself, well born and well accomplish'd all.                    330"
15318,ARGUMENT,Then thus his ancient sire weeping replied.
15319,ARGUMENT,Stranger! thou hast in truth attain'd the isle
15320,ARGUMENT,"Of thy enquiry, but it is possess'd"
15321,ARGUMENT,"By a rude race, and lawless. Vain, alas!"
15322,ARGUMENT,Were all thy num'rous gifts; yet hadst thou found
15323,ARGUMENT,"Him living here in Ithaca, with gifts"
15324,ARGUMENT,"Reciprocated he had sent thee hence,"
15325,ARGUMENT,Requiting honourably in his turn
15326,ARGUMENT,Thy hospitality. But give me quick
15327,ARGUMENT,Answer and true. How many have been the years                    340
15328,ARGUMENT,Since thy reception of that hapless guest
15329,ARGUMENT,"My son? for mine, my own dear son was he."
15330,ARGUMENT,"But him, far distant both from friends and home,"
15331,ARGUMENT,Either the fishes of the unknown Deep
15332,ARGUMENT,"Have eaten, or wild beasts and fowls of prey,"
15333,ARGUMENT,"Nor I, or she who bare him, was ordain'd"
15334,ARGUMENT,"To bathe his shrouded body with our tears,"
15335,ARGUMENT,"Nor his chaste wife, well-dow'r'd Penelope"
15336,ARGUMENT,"To close her husband's eyes, and to deplore"
15337,ARGUMENT,"His doom, which is the privilege of the dead.                    350"
15338,ARGUMENT,"But tell me also thou, for I would learn,"
15339,ARGUMENT,Who art thou? whence? where born? and sprung from whom?
15340,ARGUMENT,The bark in which thou and thy godlike friends
15341,ARGUMENT,"Arrived, where is she anchor'd on our coast?"
15342,ARGUMENT,Or cam'st thou only passenger on board
15343,ARGUMENT,"Another's bark, who landed thee and went?"
15344,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
15345,ARGUMENT,I will with all simplicity relate
15346,ARGUMENT,"What thou hast ask'd. Of Alybas am I,"
15347,ARGUMENT,"Where in much state I dwell, son of the rich                     360"
15348,ARGUMENT,"Apheidas royal Polypemon's son,"
15349,ARGUMENT,And I am named Eperitus; by storms
15350,ARGUMENT,"Driven from Sicily I have arrived,"
15351,ARGUMENT,"And yonder, on the margin of the field"
15352,ARGUMENT,"That skirts your city, I have moor'd my bark."
15353,ARGUMENT,"Five years have pass'd since thy Ulysses left,"
15354,ARGUMENT,Unhappy Chief! my country; yet the birds
15355,ARGUMENT,"At his departure hovered on the right,"
15356,ARGUMENT,"And in that sign rejoicing, I dismiss'd"
15357,ARGUMENT,"Him thence rejoicing also, for we hoped                          370"
15358,ARGUMENT,"To mix in social intercourse again,"
15359,ARGUMENT,And to exchange once more pledges of love.
15360,ARGUMENT,He spake; then sorrow as a sable cloud
15361,ARGUMENT,Involved Laertes; gath'ring with both hands
15362,ARGUMENT,"The dust, he pour'd it on his rev'rend head"
15363,ARGUMENT,With many a piteous groan. Ulysses' heart
15364,ARGUMENT,"Commotion felt, and his stretch'd nostrils throbb'd"
15365,ARGUMENT,"With agony close-pent, while fixt he eyed"
15366,ARGUMENT,His father; with a sudden force he sprang
15367,ARGUMENT,"Toward him, clasp'd, and kiss'd him, and exclaim'd.              380"
15368,ARGUMENT,My father! I am he. Thou seest thy son
15369,ARGUMENT,Absent these twenty years at last return'd.
15370,ARGUMENT,But bid thy sorrow cease; suspend henceforth
15371,ARGUMENT,"All lamentation; for I tell thee true,"
15372,ARGUMENT,(And the occasion bids me briefly tell thee)
15373,ARGUMENT,"I have slain all the suitors at my home,"
15374,ARGUMENT,And all their taunts and injuries avenged.
15375,ARGUMENT,Then answer thus Laertes quick return'd.
15376,ARGUMENT,"If thou hast come again, and art indeed"
15377,ARGUMENT,"My son Ulysses, give me then the proof                           390"
15378,ARGUMENT,"Indubitable, that I may believe."
15379,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
15380,ARGUMENT,"View, first, the scar which with his iv'ry tusk"
15381,ARGUMENT,"A wild boar gave me, when at thy command"
15382,ARGUMENT,"And at my mother's, to Autolycus"
15383,ARGUMENT,"Her father, on Parnassus, I repair'd"
15384,ARGUMENT,"Seeking the gifts which, while a guest of yours,"
15385,ARGUMENT,He promis'd should be mine. Accept beside
15386,ARGUMENT,This proof. I will enum'rate all the trees
15387,ARGUMENT,"Which, walking with thee in this cultured spot                   400"
15388,ARGUMENT,"(Boy then) I begg'd, and thou confirm'dst my own."
15389,ARGUMENT,"We paced between them, and thou mad'st me learn"
15390,ARGUMENT,"The name of each. Thou gav'st me thirteen pears,[113]"
15391,ARGUMENT,"Ten apples,[113] thirty figs,[113] and fifty ranks"
15392,ARGUMENT,"Didst promise me of vines, their alleys all"
15393,ARGUMENT,"Corn-cropp'd between. There, oft as sent from Jove"
15394,ARGUMENT,"The influences of the year descend,"
15395,ARGUMENT,Grapes of all hues and flavours clust'ring hang.
15396,ARGUMENT,"He said; Laertes, conscious of the proofs"
15397,ARGUMENT,"Indubitable by Ulysses giv'n,                                    410"
15398,ARGUMENT,With fault'ring knees and fault'ring heart both arms
15399,ARGUMENT,Around him threw. The Hero toil-inured
15400,ARGUMENT,"Drew to his bosom close his fainting sire,"
15401,ARGUMENT,"Who, breath recov'ring, and his scatter'd pow'rs"
15402,ARGUMENT,"Of intellect, at length thus spake aloud."
15403,ARGUMENT,Ye Gods! oh then your residence is still
15404,ARGUMENT,"On the Olympian heights, if punishment"
15405,ARGUMENT,At last hath seized on those flagitious men.
15406,ARGUMENT,"But terrour shakes me, lest, incensed, ere long"
15407,ARGUMENT,"All Ithaca flock hither, and dispatch                            420"
15408,ARGUMENT,Swift messengers with these dread tidings charged
15409,ARGUMENT,To ev'ry Cephallenian state around.
15410,ARGUMENT,Him answer'd then Ulysses ever-wise.
15411,ARGUMENT,"Courage! fear nought, but let us to the house"
15412,ARGUMENT,"Beside the garden, whither I have sent"
15413,ARGUMENT,"Telemachus, the herdsman, and the good"
15414,ARGUMENT,Eumæus to prepare us quick repast.
15415,ARGUMENT,"So they conferr'd, and to Laertes' house"
15416,ARGUMENT,"Pass'd on together; there arrived, they found"
15417,ARGUMENT,"Those three preparing now their plenteous feast,                 430"
15418,ARGUMENT,"And mingling sable wine; then, by the hands"
15419,ARGUMENT,"Of his Sicilian matron, the old King"
15420,ARGUMENT,"Was bathed, anointed, and attired afresh,"
15421,ARGUMENT,"And Pallas, drawing nigh, dilated more"
15422,ARGUMENT,"His limbs, and gave his whole majestic form"
15423,ARGUMENT,Encrease of amplitude. He left the bath.
15424,ARGUMENT,"His son, amazed as he had seen a God"
15425,ARGUMENT,"Alighted newly from the skies, exclaim'd."
15426,ARGUMENT,My father! doubtless some immortal Pow'r
15427,ARGUMENT,Hath clothed thy form with dignity divine.                       440
15428,ARGUMENT,Then thus replied his venerable sire.
15429,ARGUMENT,Jove! Pallas! Phœbus! oh that I possess'd
15430,ARGUMENT,"Such vigour now, as when in arms I took"
15431,ARGUMENT,"Nericus, continental city fair,"
15432,ARGUMENT,With my brave Cephallenians! oh that such
15433,ARGUMENT,"And arm'd as then, I yesterday had stood"
15434,ARGUMENT,"Beside thee in thy palace, combating"
15435,ARGUMENT,"Those suitors proud, then had I strew'd the floor"
15436,ARGUMENT,"With num'rous slain, to thy exceeding joy."
15437,ARGUMENT,"Such was their conference; and now, the task                   450"
15438,ARGUMENT,"Of preparation ended, and the feast"
15439,ARGUMENT,"Set forth, on couches and on thrones they sat,"
15440,ARGUMENT,"And, ranged in order due, took each his share."
15441,ARGUMENT,"Then, ancient Dolius, and with him, his sons"
15442,ARGUMENT,"Arrived toil-worn, by the Sicilian dame"
15443,ARGUMENT,"Summon'd, their cat'ress, and their father's kind"
15444,ARGUMENT,Attendant ever in his eve of life.
15445,ARGUMENT,"They, seeing and recalling soon to mind"
15446,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, in the middle mansion stood"
15447,ARGUMENT,"Wond'ring, when thus Ulysses with a voice                        460"
15448,ARGUMENT,"Of some reproof, but gentle, them bespake."
15449,ARGUMENT,"Old servant, sit and eat, banishing fear"
15450,ARGUMENT,"And mute amazement; for, although provoked"
15451,ARGUMENT,"By appetite, we have long time abstain'd,"
15452,ARGUMENT,Expecting ev'ry moment thy return.
15453,ARGUMENT,He said; then Dolius with expanded arms
15454,ARGUMENT,"Sprang right toward Ulysses, seized his hand,"
15455,ARGUMENT,"Kiss'd it, and in wing'd accents thus replied."
15456,ARGUMENT,Oh master ever dear! since thee the Gods
15457,ARGUMENT,"Themselves in answer to our warm desires,                        470"
15458,ARGUMENT,"Have, unexpectedly, at length restored,"
15459,ARGUMENT,"Hail, and be happy, and heav'n make thee such!"
15460,ARGUMENT,"But say, and truly; knows the prudent Queen"
15461,ARGUMENT,"Already thy return, or shall we send"
15462,ARGUMENT,Ourselves an herald with the joyful news?
15463,ARGUMENT,"To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied."
15464,ARGUMENT,"My ancient friend, thou may'st release thy mind"
15465,ARGUMENT,From that solicitude; she knows it well.
15466,ARGUMENT,So he; then Dolius to his glossy seat
15467,ARGUMENT,"Return'd, and all his sons gath'ring around                      480"
15468,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, welcom'd him and grasp'd his hand,"
15469,ARGUMENT,Then sat beside their father; thus beneath
15470,ARGUMENT,"Laertes' roof they, joyful, took repast."
15471,ARGUMENT,But Fame with rapid haste the city roam'd
15472,ARGUMENT,"In ev'ry part, promulging in all ears"
15473,ARGUMENT,The suitors' horrid fate. No sooner heard
15474,ARGUMENT,"The multitude that tale, than one and all"
15475,ARGUMENT,Groaning they met and murmuring before
15476,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses' gates. Bringing the bodies forth,"
15477,ARGUMENT,"They buried each his friend, but gave the dead                   490"
15478,ARGUMENT,Of other cities to be ferried home
15479,ARGUMENT,By fishermen on board their rapid barks.
15480,ARGUMENT,All hasted then to council; sorrow wrung
15481,ARGUMENT,"Their hearts, and, the assembly now convened,"
15482,ARGUMENT,"Arising first Eupithes spake, for grief"
15483,ARGUMENT,"Sat heavy on his soul, grief for the loss"
15484,ARGUMENT,Of his Antinoüs by Ulysses slain
15485,ARGUMENT,"Foremost of all, whom mourning, thus he said."
15486,ARGUMENT,My friends! no trivial fruits the Greecians reap
15487,ARGUMENT,Of this man's doings. _Those_ he took with him                   500
15488,ARGUMENT,"On board his barks, a num'rous train and bold,"
15489,ARGUMENT,"Then lost his barks, lost all his num'rous train,"
15490,ARGUMENT,"And _these_, our noblest, slew at his return."
15491,ARGUMENT,Come therefore--ere he yet escape by flight
15492,ARGUMENT,"To Pylus or to noble Elis, realm"
15493,ARGUMENT,"Of the Epeans, follow him; else shame"
15494,ARGUMENT,Attends us and indelible reproach.
15495,ARGUMENT,If we avenge not on these men the blood
15496,ARGUMENT,"Of our own sons and brothers, farewell then"
15497,ARGUMENT,All that makes life desirable; my wish                           510
15498,ARGUMENT,Henceforth shall be to mingle with the shades.
15499,ARGUMENT,Oh then pursue and seize them ere they fly.
15500,ARGUMENT,"Thus he with tears, and pity moved in all."
15501,ARGUMENT,"Then, Medon and the sacred bard whom sleep"
15502,ARGUMENT,"Had lately left, arriving from the house"
15503,ARGUMENT,"Of Laertiades, approach'd; amid"
15504,ARGUMENT,"The throng they stood; all wonder'd seeing them,"
15505,ARGUMENT,"And Medon, prudent senior, thus began."
15506,ARGUMENT,"Hear me, my countrymen! Ulysses plann'd"
15507,ARGUMENT,With no disapprobation of the Gods                               520
15508,ARGUMENT,"The deed that ye deplore. I saw, myself,"
15509,ARGUMENT,"A Pow'r immortal at the Hero's side,"
15510,ARGUMENT,"In semblance just of Mentor; now the God,"
15511,ARGUMENT,"In front apparent, led him on, and now,"
15512,ARGUMENT,"From side to side of all the palace, urged"
15513,ARGUMENT,To flight the suitors; heaps on heaps they fell.
15514,ARGUMENT,"He said; then terrour wan seiz'd ev'ry cheek,"
15515,ARGUMENT,"And Halitherses, Hero old, the son"
15516,ARGUMENT,"Of Mastor, who alone among them all"
15517,ARGUMENT,"Knew past, and future, prudent, thus began.                      530"
15518,ARGUMENT,"Now, O ye men of Ithaca! my words"
15519,ARGUMENT,"Attentive hear! by your own fault, my friends,"
15520,ARGUMENT,This deed hath been perform'd; for when myself
15521,ARGUMENT,And noble Mentor counsell'd you to check
15522,ARGUMENT,"The sin and folly of your sons, ye would not."
15523,ARGUMENT,"Great was their wickedness, and flagrant wrong"
15524,ARGUMENT,"They wrought, the wealth devouring and the wife"
15525,ARGUMENT,Dishonouring of an illustrious Chief
15526,ARGUMENT,Whom they deem'd destined never to return.
15527,ARGUMENT,"But hear my counsel. Go not, lest ye draw                        540"
15528,ARGUMENT,Disaster down and woe on your own heads.
15529,ARGUMENT,He ended; then with boist'rous roar (although
15530,ARGUMENT,"Part kept their seats) upsprang the multitude,"
15531,ARGUMENT,"For Halitherses pleased them not, they chose"
15532,ARGUMENT,Eupithes' counsel rather; all at once
15533,ARGUMENT,"To arms they flew, and clad in dazzling brass"
15534,ARGUMENT,Before the city form'd their dense array.
15535,ARGUMENT,Leader infatuate at their head appear'd
15536,ARGUMENT,"Eupithes, hoping to avenge his son"
15537,ARGUMENT,"Antinoüs, but was himself ordain'd                               550"
15538,ARGUMENT,"To meet his doom, and to return no more."
15539,ARGUMENT,Then thus Minerva to Saturnian Jove.
15540,ARGUMENT,Oh father! son of Saturn! Jove supreme!
15541,ARGUMENT,Declare the purpose hidden in thy breast.
15542,ARGUMENT,"Wilt thou that this hostility proceed,"
15543,ARGUMENT,Or wilt thou grant them amity again?
15544,ARGUMENT,To whom the cloud-assembler God replied.
15545,ARGUMENT,Why asks my daughter? didst thou not design
15546,ARGUMENT,"Thyself, that brave Ulysses coming home"
15547,ARGUMENT,"Should slay those profligates? act as thou wilt,                 560"
15548,ARGUMENT,"But thus I counsel, since the noble Chief"
15549,ARGUMENT,"Hath slain the suitors, now let peace ensue"
15550,ARGUMENT,"Oath-bound, and reign Ulysses evermore!"
15551,ARGUMENT,The slaughter of their brethren and their sons
15552,ARGUMENT,"To strike from their remembrance, shall be ours."
15553,ARGUMENT,"Let mutual amity, as at the first,"
15554,ARGUMENT,"Unite them, and let wealth and peace abound."
15555,ARGUMENT,"So saying, he animated to her task"
15556,ARGUMENT,"Minerva prompt before, and from the heights"
15557,ARGUMENT,Olympian down to Ithaca she flew.                                570
15558,ARGUMENT,Meantime Ulysses (for their hunger now
15559,ARGUMENT,And thirst were sated) thus address'd his hinds.
15560,ARGUMENT,"Look ye abroad, lest haply they approach."
15561,ARGUMENT,"He said, and at his word, forth went a son"
15562,ARGUMENT,"Of Dolius; at the gate he stood, and thence"
15563,ARGUMENT,"Beholding all that multitude at hand,"
15564,ARGUMENT,In accents wing'd thus to Ulysses spake.
15565,ARGUMENT,They come--they are already arrived--arm all!
15566,ARGUMENT,"Then, all arising, put their armour on,"
15567,ARGUMENT,"Ulysses with his three, and the six sons                         580"
15568,ARGUMENT,"Of Dolius; Dolius also with the rest,"
15569,ARGUMENT,"Arm'd and Laertes, although silver-hair'd,"
15570,ARGUMENT,Warriors perforce. When all were clad alike
15571,ARGUMENT,"In radiant armour, throwing wide the gates"
15572,ARGUMENT,"They sallied, and Ulysses led the way."
15573,ARGUMENT,"Then Jove's own daughter Pallas, in the form"
15574,ARGUMENT,"And with the voice of Mentor, came in view,"
15575,ARGUMENT,"Whom seeing Laertiades rejoiced,"
15576,ARGUMENT,"And thus Telemachus, his son, bespake."
15577,ARGUMENT,"Now, oh my son! thou shalt observe, untold                     590"
15578,ARGUMENT,"By me, where fight the bravest. Oh shame not"
15579,ARGUMENT,"Thine ancestry, who have in all the earth"
15580,ARGUMENT,Proof given of valour in all ages past.
15581,ARGUMENT,"To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied."
15582,ARGUMENT,"My father! if thou wish that spectacle,"
15583,ARGUMENT,"Thou shalt behold thy son, as thou hast said,"
15584,ARGUMENT,In nought dishonouring his noble race.
15585,ARGUMENT,"Then was Laertes joyful, and exclaim'd,"
15586,ARGUMENT,What sun hath ris'n to-day?[114] oh blessed Gods!
15587,ARGUMENT,My son and grandson emulous dispute                              600
15588,ARGUMENT,"The prize of glory, and my soul exults."
15589,ARGUMENT,"He ended, and Minerva drawing nigh"
15590,ARGUMENT,"To the old King, thus counsell'd him. Oh friend"
15591,ARGUMENT,"Whom most I love, son of Arcesias! pray'r"
15592,ARGUMENT,"Preferring to the virgin azure-eyed,"
15593,ARGUMENT,"And to her father Jove, delay not, shake"
15594,ARGUMENT,"Thy lance in air, and give it instant flight."
15595,ARGUMENT,"So saying, the Goddess nerved his arm anew."
15596,ARGUMENT,"He sought in pray'r the daughter dread of Jove,"
15597,ARGUMENT,"And, brandishing it, hurl'd his lance; it struck                 610"
15598,ARGUMENT,"Eupithes, pierced his helmet brazen-cheek'd"
15599,ARGUMENT,"That stay'd it not, but forth it sprang beyond,"
15600,ARGUMENT,And with loud clangor of his arms he fell.
15601,ARGUMENT,Then flew Ulysses and his noble son
15602,ARGUMENT,With faulchion and with spear of double edge
15603,ARGUMENT,"To the assault, and of them all had left"
15604,ARGUMENT,"None living, none had to his home return'd,"
15605,ARGUMENT,But that Jove's virgin daughter with a voice

15662,NOTE I.,should be explained by the supposition that the Homeric bards had heard
15663,NOTE I.,"tales of northern latitudes, where, in summer-time, the darkness was so"
15664,NOTE I.,short that evening was followed almost at once by morning. Thus the
15665,NOTE I.,herdsman coming home in the twilight at one day's close might meet and
15666,NOTE I.,hail the shepherd who was starting betimes for the next day's work.
15667,NOTE I.,
15668,NOTE I.,"Line 86 in the Greek ought probably to be translated, ""For the paths of"

15680,NOTE II.,"Others translate, ""And from the sea shall thy own death come,"" suggesting"
15681,NOTE II.,that Ulysses after all was lost at sea. This is the rendering followed by

15690,NOTE III.,"gives as a paraphrase ""spikes, crested with a ring,"" elsewhere means"
15691,NOTE III.,"_axes_, and ought so to be translated here. For since Cowper's day an"
15692,NOTE III.,axe-head of the Mycenæan period has been discovered _with the blade
15693,NOTE III.,pierced_ so as to form a hole through which an arrow could pass. (See
15694,NOTE III.,"Tsountas and Manatt, _The Mycenæan Age_.) Axes of this type were not"
15695,NOTE III.,"known to Cowper, and hence the hypothesis in his text. He realised"
15696,NOTE III.,correctly the essential conditions of the feat proposed: the axes must
15697,NOTE III.,"have been set up, one behind the other, in the way he suggested for his"

15705,NOTE IV.,"no evidence for this, and l. 139 ff. (l. 126 ff. in the Greek) suggest"
15706,NOTE IV.,"rather strongly that there was only _one_. Unfortunately, the crucial"
15707,NOTE IV.,word ῥῶγες which occurs in the line describing Melanthius' exit is not
15708,NOTE IV.,"found elsewhere. ""He went up,"" the poet says, ""through the ῥῶγες of the"
15709,NOTE IV.,"hall."" Merry suggests that ""he scrambled up to the loopholes that were"
15710,NOTE IV.,"pierced in the wall."" Others suppose that there was a ladder at the inner"
