73,PREFACE.,
74,PREFACE.,"HOMERIC archæology has, within the last few years, finally left the"
75,PREFACE.,groove of purely academic discussion to advance along the new route laid
76,PREFACE.,down for it by practical methods of investigation. The results are full
77,PREFACE.,"of present interest, and of future promise. They already imply a"
78,PREFACE.,"reconstruction of the Hellenic past; they vitalise the Homeric world,"
79,PREFACE.,"bringing it into definite relations with what went before, and with what"
80,PREFACE.,"came after, and transforming it from a poetical creation into an"
81,PREFACE.,"historical reality. Excavations and explorations in Greece, Egypt, and"
82,PREFACE.,"Asia Minor, have thus entirely changed the aspect of the perennial"
83,PREFACE.,"Homeric problem, and afford reasonable hope of providing it with a"
84,PREFACE.,satisfactory solution.
85,PREFACE.,
86,PREFACE.,
87,PREFACE.,"These remarkable, and promptly-gathered fruits of an experimental system"
88,PREFACE.,"of inquiry deserve the attention, not of scholars alone, but of every"
89,PREFACE.,"educated person; nevertheless, their value has as yet been realised by a"
90,PREFACE.,"very limited class. The following chapters may then, it is hoped,"
91,PREFACE.,usefully serve to illustrate some of them for the benefit of the general
92,PREFACE.,"reading public, while making no pretension to discuss, formally or"
93,PREFACE.,"exhaustively, the wide subject of Homeric antiquities. For the proper"
94,PREFACE.,"discharge of that task, indeed, qualifications would be needed to which"
95,PREFACE.,the writer lays no claim. The object of the present little work will be
96,PREFACE.,attained if it contribute to stir a wider interest in the topics it
97,PREFACE.,"discusses; above all, should it in any degree help to promote a"
98,PREFACE.,non-erudite study of the noble poetical monuments it is concerned with.
99,PREFACE.,Greek enough to read the Iliad and Odyssey in the original can be
100,PREFACE.,learned with comparative ease; and what trouble there may be in its
101,PREFACE.,acquisition meets an ample reward in mental profit and enjoyment of a
102,PREFACE.,high order. These ancient epics have a unique freshness about them; they
103,PREFACE.,are still open founts of animating pleasure for all who choose to apply
104,PREFACE.,"to them; one cannot, then, but regret that so few have intellectual"
105,PREFACE.,energy to do so.

108,PREFACE.,"The author’s best thanks are due to Messrs. Macmillan, and to Messrs."
109,PREFACE.,"Hodder and Stoughton, for their courteous permission to reprint the"
110,PREFACE.,"chapters entitled ‘Homeric Astronomy,’ ‘Homer’s Magic Herbs,’ and ‘The"
111,PREFACE.,"Dog in Homer,’ originally published in the pages of _Nature_,"
112,PREFACE.,"_Macmillan’s Magazine_, and the _British Quarterly Review_ respectively."
113,PREFACE.,
114,PREFACE.,
115,PREFACE.,"In quoting illustrative passages from the Homeric poems, considerable"
116,PREFACE.,use has been made of the admirable prose version of the Iliad by Messrs.
117,PREFACE.,"Lang, Leaf, and Myers, and of the Odyssey by Messrs. Butcher and Lang."
118,PREFACE.,"With the object, however, of securing a certain variety of effect,"
119,PREFACE.,"versified translations have also been resorted to, their authors being"
120,PREFACE.,"duly specified in foot-notes. The citations of Helbig’s valuable work,"
121,PREFACE.,"_Das Homerische Epos aus den Denkmälern erläutert_, refer to the second"
122,PREFACE.,enlarged edition published in 1887.

170,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
171,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
172,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,THE perennial youth of the Homeric poems is without a parallel in the
173,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,history of art. No other imaginative works have so nearly succeeded in
174,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,bidding defiance to the ‘tooth of time.’ Like the golden watch-dogs of
175,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Alcinous, they seem destined to be ‘deathless and ageless all their"
176,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,days.’ Nor is theirs the faded immortality of Tithonus—the bare
177,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"preservation of a material form emptied of the glow of vitality, and"
178,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,grown out of harmony with its environment. Their survival is not even
179,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"that of an ‘Attic shape’ whose undeniable beauty has, in our eyes,"
180,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"assumed somewhat of a recondite coldness, very different from the"
181,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"loveliness of old, when connoisseurship was not needed for appreciation."
182,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,The Iliad and Odyssey are still auroral. They have the charm of an
183,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"‘unpremeditated lay,’ springing from the very source of our own life;"
184,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,they appeal alike to rude sensibilities and to cultivated tastes; their
185,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"splendour and pathos, their powerful vitality, the strength and"
186,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"swiftness of their numbers, require to be accentuated by no critical"
187,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,notes of admiration; they strike of themselves the least tutored native
188,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,perception. These vigorous growths out of the deep soil of humanity have
189,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,not yet been transported from the open air of indiscriminate enjoyment
190,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,into the greenhouse of æstheticism; delight in them lays hold of any
191,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,schoolboy capable of reading them fluently in the original as naturally
192,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,as enthralment with ‘Cinderella’ or ‘Jack the Giant-Killer’ commands the
193,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"unreflecting nursery. For they combine, as no other primitive poetry"
194,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"does, imaginative energy with sobriety of thought and diction. The _ne"
195,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,quid nimis_ regulates all their scenes. They are simple without being
196,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"archaic, fervid without extravagance, fanciful, yet never grotesque. The"
197,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,strict proprieties of classic form effectually restrain in them the
198,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,exuberance of romantic invention. Not that any such distinctions in the
199,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,mode of composition had then begun to be thought of. The poet was
200,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,unconsciously a ‘law unto himself.’ Indeed the very potency of his
201,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,creative faculty prescribed retrenchment and moderation; the images
202,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,conjured up by it with much of the plastic reality of sculpture
203,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,subjecting themselves spontaneously to the laws of sculpturesque
204,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"fitness. Clear-cut and firm of outline, they move in the transparent"
205,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,ether of definite thought. Projected into the vaporous atmosphere of a
206,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"riotous fancy, they might show vaster, but they could hardly be equally"
207,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,impressive.
208,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
209,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,But these matchless productions are not merely the ‘wood-notes wild’ of
210,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,untrained inspiration. They imply a long course of free development
211,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,under favourable conditions. The vehicle of expression used in them
212,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,might alone well be the product of centuries of pre-literary culture.
213,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Greek hexameter verse was by no means an obvious contrivance. It is an
214,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"exceedingly subtle structure, depending for its effect—nay, for its"
215,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,existence—upon unvarying obedience to a complex set of metrical rules.
216,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"These could not have originated all at once, by the decree of some"
217,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,poetical law-giver. They must have been arrived at more or less
218,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"tentatively by repeated experiments, the recognised success of which"
219,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"led, in the slow course of time, to their general adoption."
220,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
221,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Moreover, the legendary materials of the Epics were not dug straight out"
222,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,of the mine of popular fancy and tradition. They had doubtless been
223,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"elaborated and manipulated, before Homer took them in hand, by"
224,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,generations of singers and reciters. The ‘tale of Troy divine’ was
225,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,already a full-leaved tree when he plucked from it and planted the
226,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,branches destined to flourish through the ages. His verses display or
227,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,betray acquaintance with many ‘other stories’ of public notoriety
228,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"besides those completely unfolded in them. The fate of Agamemnon, the"
229,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"death of Achilles, the madness of Ajax, the advent of Neoptolemus, the"
230,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"slaying of Memnon, son of the Morning, the ambush in the Wooden Horse,"
231,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the mysterious wanderings of Helen, the last journey of Odysseus,"
232,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"furnished themes of surpassing interest, all or most of which had been"
233,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,made into songs for the pastime of lordly feasters and the solace of
234,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"noble dames, before the wrath of Achilles suggested a more adventurous"
235,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"flight. Inexhaustible, indeed, was the store of romantic adventure"
236,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,furnished by the famous ten years’ siege.
237,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
238,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"A castle built in cloudland, or at most"
239,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"A crumbling clay-fort on a windy hill,"
240,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Where needy men might flee a robber-host,"
241,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"This, this was Troy! and yet she holds us still.[1]"
242,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
243,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Footnote 1:
244,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
245,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Lang’s _Helen of Troy_, vi. 21."
246,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
247,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,But the saga-literature of the Greeks did not begin with the mustering
248,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,of the fleet at Aulis. The ‘ante-Troica’ were not neglected. Many a
249,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,ballad was chanted about the doings of those ‘strong men’ who ‘lived
250,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"before Agamemnon,’ although it was not their fortune to be commemorated"
251,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"by a supreme singer. That supreme singer, however, knew much concerning"
252,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the Argonauts, the War of Thebes, the Calydonian Boar-hunt, the sorrows"
253,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"of Niobe, and the betrayal of Bellerophon; ante-Trojan lays served as"
254,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"parables for the instruction of Clytemnestra, and the recreation of"
255,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Achilles in that disastrous interval when he doffed his armour and
256,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,strung his lyre. And a small but privileged class of the community was
257,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"devoted, under the presumed tuition of the Muses, to the perfecting and"
258,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,perpetuation of these treasures of poetic lore.
259,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
260,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Homer was accordingly no unprepared phenomenon. He rose in a sky already
261,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"luminous. The flowering of his genius, indeed, marked the close of an"
262,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,epoch. His achievements were of the definitive and synthetic kind; they
263,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,summed up and surpassed what had previously been accomplished; they were
264,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,the outcome—although not the necessary outcome—of a multitude of minor
265,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,performances.
266,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
267,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Now it is impossible to admit the prevalence of such sustained poetical
268,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"activity as the Homeric Epics by their very nature postulate, apart from"
269,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,the existence of a tolerably widespread and well-regulated social
270,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,organisation. They besides describe a polity which was certainly not
271,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"imaginary, and thus lead us back to a pre-Hellenic world, different in"
272,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"many ways from historical Greece, and separated from it by several blank"
273,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"and silent centuries. The people who moved and suffered, and nurtured"
274,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"their loves and grudges in it, were called ‘Achæans’—the ethnical title"
275,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,given by Homer to his countrymen from all parts of the Greek peninsula
276,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,and its adjacent islands. Homer himself was evidently an Achæan;
277,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Achilles, Agamemnon, and Odysseus, Helen and Penelope, sprang from the"
278,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"same race, which was an offshoot from the general Hellenic stock. They"
279,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"were a seafaring people, but not much given to commerce; active,"
280,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"energetic, sensitive, highly imaginative, they showed, nevertheless,"
281,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,receptivity rather than inventiveness as regards the practical arts of
282,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,life. Their great national exploit was probably that bellicose
283,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"expedition to the Troad upon which the Ilian legend, with all its"
284,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"mythical accretions, was founded; and some records of attacks by them on"
285,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Egypt have been deciphered on hieroglyphically-inscribed monuments; but
286,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"they can claim no assured place in history. As a nation, they ceased"
287,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,indeed to exist before the dim epoch of fables came to an end; the
288,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Dorian conquest of the Peloponnesus brought about their political
289,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"annihilation and social disintegration, impelling them, nevertheless, to"
290,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"establish new settlements in Asia Minor, and thus setting on foot the"
291,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,long process by which Greek culture became cosmopolitan.
292,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
293,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Homeric conditions do not then represent simply an initial stage in
294,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,classic Greek civilisation. There was no continuous progress from the
295,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,one state of things to the other. Development was interrupted by
296,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"revolution. Hence, much irretrievable loss and prolonged seething"
297,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"confusion; until, out of the chaos, a renovated order emerged, and the"
298,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Greece of the Olympiads comes to view in the year 776 B.C.
299,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
300,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,For this reason Homeric Greece is strange to history; the relative
301,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"importance of the states included in it, the centre of gravity of its"
302,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"political power, the modes of government and manners of men it displays,"
303,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,are all very different from what they had become in the time of
304,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Herodotus. But it is only of late that these differences have come to
305,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"have an intelligible meaning. Until expounded by archæological research,"
306,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,they were a source of unmixed perplexity to the learned. The state of
307,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,society described by Homer could certainly not be regarded as
308,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"fictitious; yet it hung suspended, as it were, in the air, without"
309,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,definite limitations of time or place. These uncertainties have now been
310,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"removed. The excavations at Mycenæ, undertaken by Dr. Schliemann in"
311,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"1876, may be said to have had for their upshot the rediscovery of the"

313,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"to light from the ‘shaft-tombs’ of Agamemnon’s citadel, the ‘bee-hive"
314,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"tombs’ of the lower city, in the palaces and other coeval buildings of"
315,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Tiryns, Mycenæ, and Orchomenos. The points of agreement between Homeric"
316,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"delineations and Mycenæan antiquities are, in fact, too numerous to"
317,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,permit the entertainment of any reasonable doubt that the poet’s
318,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"experience lay in the daily round of Mycenæan life—of life, that is to"
319,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"say, governed by the same ideas and carried on under approximately the"
320,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,same conditions with those prevailing through the ancient realm of the
321,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,sons of Atreus.
322,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
323,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,The detection of this close relationship has lent a totally new aspect
324,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"to what is called the Homeric Question, widening its scope at the same"
325,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,time that it provides a sure basis for its discussion. For this can no
326,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,longer be disconnected from inquiries into the status and fortunes of
327,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the great confederacy, out of the wreck of which the splendid fabric of"
328,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Hellenic society arose. The civilisation centred at Mycenæ covered a
329,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,wide range; how wide we do not yet fully know: the results of future
330,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,explorations must be awaited before its limits can be fixed. It
331,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"undoubtedly spread, however, beyond Greece proper through the Sporades"
332,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"to Crete, Rhodes, the coasts of Asia Minor, and even to Egypt. The"
333,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,traces left behind by it in Egypt are of particular importance.[2] From
334,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the Mycenæan pottery discovered in the Fayûm, tangible proof has been"
335,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,derived that the Græco-Libyan assaults upon that country were to some
336,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"extent effective, and that the seafaring people who took part in them"
337,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"were no other than the Homeric Achæans, then in an early stage of their"
338,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,career. The fact of their having secured a foothold in the Nile Valley
339,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"accounts, too, for the strong Egyptian element in Mycenæan art; and the"
340,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,evidence of habitual intercourse is further curiously strengthened by
341,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,the presence of an ostrich egg amid the other antique remains in the
342,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Myceneæan citadel graves.[3] Above all, the Egypto-Mycenæan pottery,"
343,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"from its association with other objects of known dates, is determinable"
344,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"as to time. And it appears, as the outcome of Mr. Flinders Petrie’s"
345,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"careful comparisons, that one class of vases, adorned with linear"
346,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"patterns, goes back to about 1400 B.C., while those exhibiting"
347,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,naturalistic designs were freely manufactured in 1100. The culminating
348,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"period, however, of pre-Hellenic fictile art is placed considerably"
349,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"earlier, in 1500-1400 B.C., and there are indications that its"
350,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"development had occupied several previous centuries. Mr. Petrie, indeed,"
351,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,finds himself compelled to believe that the Græco-Libyan league was
352,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"already active in or before the year 2000 B.C. Achæan predominance may,"
353,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"then, very well have boasted a millennium of antiquity when the Dorians"
354,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,crossed the Gulf of Corinth. Its subversion drove many of the leading
355,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"native families over the Ægean, where they found seats already doubtless"
356,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,familiar to them through their own and their ancestors’ maritime and
357,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"piratical adventures, and the colonising impulse once given, did not"
358,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,soon cease to promote the enlargement of the Greek domain. But the mass
359,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"of the Achæan people lived on in their old homes, in a state of"
360,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,subjection resembling that of the Saxons in England after the Norman
361,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Conquest. They were designated ‘Periœci’ by their Dorian rulers.

382,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"competed for the honour of having given birth to their author. Wherever,"
383,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"in short, their study was localised by the foundation of a school of"
384,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"‘Homerids,’ there was asserted to be the native place of the eponymous"
385,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,bard. The truth is that no really authentic tradition regarding him
386,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"reached posterity. The very name of ‘Homer,’ or the ‘joiner together,’"
387,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,is obviously rather typical than personal; and it gradually came to
388,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,aggregate round it all that was antique and unclaimed in the way of
389,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"verse. The aggregation, it is true, was presumably formed in Asiatic"
390,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Ionia; the ‘Cyclic Poems,’ supplementary to the Iliad, were mainly the"
391,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,work of Ionic poets; and the Epic was substantially an Ionic dialect.
392,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Yet the inference of an Asiatic origin thence naturally arising now
393,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"clearly appears to be invalid. The linguistic argument, to begin with,"
394,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,has been completely disposed of by Fick’s remarkable demonstration that
395,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,the Iliad and Odyssey underwent an early process of Ionicisation.[4] So
396,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"far as metrical considerations permitted, they were actually translated"
397,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"from the Æolic, or rather Achæan tongue, in which they were composed,"
398,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,into the current idiom of Colophon and Miletus. Objections urged from
399,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,this side against their production in Europe have accordingly lost their
400,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"force; and the reasons favouring it, always strong, have of late grown"
401,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,to be well-nigh irresistible. Some of the more cogent were briefly
402,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,stated by Mr. D. B. Monro in 1886;[5] and others might now be added. One
403,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"only, but one surely conclusive, need here be mentioned. It is this."
404,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Homer could not have been an Asiatic Greek, because Asiatic Greece did"
405,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,not exist in Homer’s time. He was aware of no Achæan settlements in Asia
406,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Minor; not one of the twelve cities of the Ionian confederacy emerges in
407,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the Catalogue, Miletus only excepted, and Miletus with a special note of"
408,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"‘barbarian’ habitation attached to it.[6] The Ionian name is, in the"
409,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Iliad, once applied to the Athenians[7] (presumably), but does not occur"
410,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"at all in the Odyssey; where, on the other hand, Dorians, unknown in the"
411,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Iliad, are casually named as forming an element in the mixed population"
412,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"of Crete.[8] The reputed birthplaces of Homer, then, on the eastern"
413,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"coast of the Ægean, were, when he had reached his singing prime, still"
414,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,occupied by Carians and Mæonians; and we must accordingly look for his
415,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,origin in the West. There is no escape from this conclusion except by
416,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,the subterfuge of imagining the geography of the Epics to be
417,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"artificially archaic. They related to a past time, it might be said,"
418,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,they should then reproduce the conditions of the past. But this is a
419,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,notion essentially modern. No primitive poet ever troubled himself about
420,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"such scruples of congruity. Nor if he did, could the requisite detailed"
421,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"information by possibility be at his command, while his painful care to"
422,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,avoid what we call anachronisms would cause nothing but perplexity to
423,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,his unsophisticated audience. Homer’s map of Greece must accordingly be
424,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,accepted as a true picture of what came under his personal observation.
425,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"It is, indeed, as Mr. Freeman says, ‘so different from the map of Greece"
426,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,at any later time that it is inconceivable that it can have been
427,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"invented at any later time.’[9] Since, however, it affords the Greek"
428,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"race no Asiatic standing ground, it follows of necessity that Homer was"
429,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,a European.

456,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,This same consideration helps to determine the age in which he lived.
457,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Homeric geography is entirely pre-Dorian. Total unconsciousness of any
458,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,such event as the Dorian invasion reigns both in the Iliad and Odyssey.
459,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Not a hint betrays acquaintance with the fact that the polity described
460,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"in them had, in the meantime, been overturned by external violence. A"
461,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,silence so remarkable can be explained only by the simple supposition
462,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"that when they were composed, the revolution in question had not yet"
463,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,occurred. Other circumstances confirm this view. Practical explorations
464,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"have shown pre-Hellenic Greece to have been the seat of a rich,"
465,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"enterprising, and cultivated nation. They have hence removed objections"
466,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"on the score of savagery, inevitably to be encountered, formerly urged"
467,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,against pushing the age of Homer very far back into the past. The life
468,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"carried on at Mycenæ, in fact, twelve or thirteen centuries before the"
469,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Christian era, was in many respects more refined than that depicted in"
470,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,the poems. It was known to their author only after it had lost something
471,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,of its pristine splendour. But the Mycenæan civilisation of his
472,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"experience, if a trifle decayed, was complete and dominant; and this it"
473,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"never was subsequently to the Dorian conquest. To have collected,"
474,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"however, into an imaginary organic whole the fragments into which it had"
475,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"been shattered by that catastrophe, would assuredly have been a task"
476,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"beyond his powers. Nothing remains, then, but to admit that he lived in"
477,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the pre-Dorian Greece which he portrayed. Moreover, the state of"
478,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,seething unrest ensuing upon the overthrow of the Mycenæan order must
479,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,have been absolutely inconsistent with the development of a great school
480,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"of poetry. If Homer, then, was a European—as appears certain—the"
481,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,inference is irresistible that he flourished before the society to which
482,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,he belonged was thrown by foreign invaders into irredeemable
483,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"disarray—that is, at some section of the Mycenæan epoch."
484,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
485,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,There are many convincing reasons for holding that section to have been
486,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,a late one. One of the principal is the familiar use of iron in the
487,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"poems, although none has been met with in the old shaft-tombs within the"
488,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"citadel of Mycenæ, and only small quantities in the less distinguished"
489,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"graves below. It is, to be sure, conceivable that a substance introduced"
490,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,as a vulgar novelty devoid of traditional or ancestral associations
491,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,might have been employed for the ordinary purposes of everyday life long
492,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,before it was allowed to form part of sepulchral equipments; a similar
493,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,motive prescribing its virtual exclusion from the Homeric Olympus.
494,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Still, the discrepancy can hardly be explained away without the"
495,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,concession of some lapse of time as well.
496,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
497,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"The Homeric and Mycenæan modes of burial, too, were different. Cremation"
498,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,is practised throughout the Epics; the Mycenæan dead were preserved
499,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"intact. ‘The contrast,’ Dr. Leaf remarks,[10] ‘is a striking one; but it"
500,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,is easy to lay too much stress upon it. It may well be that the
501,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,conditions of sepulture on a campaign were perforce different from those
502,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,usual in times of peace at home. The mummifying of the body and the
503,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,carrying of it to the ancestral burying-place in the royal citadel were
504,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,not operations such as could be easily effected amidst the hurry of
505,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,marches or the privations of a siege; least of all after the slaughter
506,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,of a pitched battle. It is therefore quite conceivable that two methods
507,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,of sepulture may of necessity have been in use at the same time. And for
508,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,this assumption the Iliad itself gives us positive grounds. One warrior
509,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,who falls is taken home to be buried; for to a dead son of Zeus means of
510,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,carriage and preservation can be supplied which are not for common men.
511,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Sarpedon is cleansed by Apollo, and borne by Death and Sleep to his"
512,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"distant home in Lycia, not that his body may be burnt, but that his"
513,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"brethren and kinsfolk may _preserve_ it ‘with a tomb and gravestone, for"

537,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,evidence is indecisive—left traces in the more recent graves of the
538,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Mycenæan people. What is certain is that simple interment was everywhere
539,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"primitively in use, and that the pyre was a subsequent innovation, at"
540,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"first only partially adopted, and perhaps nowhere exclusively in vogue."
541,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
542,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,The plastic art of Mycenæ seems to have been on the decline when the
543,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,‘sovran poet’ arose. This can be inferred from the wondering admiration
544,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,displayed in his verses for what must once have been its ordinary
545,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"performances, as well as from the marked superiority assigned in them to"
546,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,foreign over native artists. They include besides no allusion to the
547,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"signet-rings so plentiful at Mycenæ, no notice, in any connexion, of the"
548,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"art of gem-engraving, nor of the indispensable luxury—to ladies of high"
549,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"degree—of toilet-mirrors. Active intercourse with Egypt, again, had"
550,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"evidently ceased long prior to the Homeric age. The Nile is, in the"
551,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"poems, not even known by name, but only as the ‘river of Egypt;’ and the"
552,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"country is reached, not in the ordinary course of navigation, but"
553,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"through recklessness or ill-luck, by adventurers or castaways."
554,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
555,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,We can now gather the following indications regarding the date of the
556,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Homeric poems. They must have originated during the interval between the
557,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Trojan War—which, in some shape, may be accepted as an historical"
558,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,event—and the Dorian invasion of the Peloponnesus. They probably
559,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"originated not very long before the latter event, when the Mycenæan"
560,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,monarchy was of itself tottering towards a fall precipitated by the
561,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,frequently repeated incursions of ruder tribes from the north. The
562,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,generally accepted date for the final event is eighty years after the
563,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"taking of Troy, or 1104 B.C. But this rests on no authentic"
564,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"circumstance, and may very well be a century or more in error. A"
565,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,preferable chronological arrangement would place Homer’s flourishing in
566,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the eleventh century, and the overthrow of Mycenæ near its close."
567,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Difficulties of sundry kinds can thus be, in a measure, evaded or"
568,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"conciliated, without encroaching overmuch on the voiceless centuries"
569,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,available for the unrecorded readjustment of the disturbed elements of
570,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Greek polity.
571,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
572,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,As to the mode of origin of the two great poems which have come down to
573,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"us from so remote an age, much might be said; but a few words must here"
574,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,suffice. It is a topic on which the utmost diversity of opinion has
575,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"prevailed since F. A. Wolf published, in 1795, his famous ‘Prolegomena,’"
576,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,and as to which unity of views seems now for ever unattainable. For
577,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"demonstrative evidence is naturally out of the question, and estimates"
578,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,of opposing probabilities are apt to be strongly tinctured with
579,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"‘personality.’ Prepossessions of all kinds warp the judgment, even in"
580,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"purely literary matters, and, in this case especially, have led to the"
581,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"learned advocacy of extreme opinions. Thus, partisans of destructive"
582,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,criticism have carried the analysis of the Homeric poems to the verge of
583,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"annihilation; while ultra-conservatives insist upon a seamless whole,"
584,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"and regard the Iliad and the Odyssey as the work of Homer, in the same"
585,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,sense and with the same implicit confidence that they hold the Æneid and
586,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the Eclogues to be Virgilian, or ‘Paradise Lost’ and ‘Samson Agonistes’"
587,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"to be Miltonic productions. Between these widely diverging paths,"
588,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"however, there is a middle way laid down by common sense, which it is"
589,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,tolerably safe to follow. A few simple considerations may help us to
590,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,find it.
591,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
592,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"We must remember, in the first place, that the Homeric poems were"
593,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"composed, not to be privately read, but to be publicly recited. They"
594,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"remained unwritten during at least a couple of centuries, flung on the"
595,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,waves of unaided human memory. Oral tradition alone preserved them; and
596,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,not the punctilious oral tradition of a sacerdotal caste like the
597,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Brahmins, but that of a bold and innovating class of ‘rhapsodes,’"
598,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"themselves aspiring to some share in the Muse’s immediate favours, and"
599,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,prompt to flatter the local vanities and immemorial susceptibilities of
600,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"their varied audiences. Within very wide limits, they were free to"
601,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,‘improve’ what long training had enabled them to appropriate. Their
602,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,licence infringed no literary property; there was no authorised text to
603,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"be corrupted; one man’s version was as good as another’s. It is not,"
604,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"then, surprising that the primitive order of the Epics became here and"
605,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"there disarranged, or that interpolated and substituted passages usurped"
606,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,positions from which they could not afterwards easily be expelled.
607,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Expository efforts have, indeed, sometimes succeeded only in adding"
608,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"fresh knots to the already tangled skein. Pisistratus, however, did good"
609,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,service by for the first time _editing_ the Homeric poems.[12] Scattered
610,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,manuscripts of them had doubtless existed long previously; but it was
611,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"their collection and collation at Athens, and the disposal in a"
612,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"determinate succession of the still disjointed materials they afforded,"
613,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,which placed the Greek people in the earliest full possession of their
614,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,epical inheritance.

621,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"As the general result of a century of Homeric controversy, instinctive"
622,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,appreciation may be said broadly to have got the better of verbal
623,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,criticism. Not but that the latter has done valuable work; but it is now
624,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"pretty plainly seen to have been, in some quarters, carried considerably"
625,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,too far. The triumphs enjoyed by German advocates of the
626,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"‘Kleinliedertheorie’—of the disjunction, that is to say, of the Epics"
627,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,into numerous separate lays—are generally recognised to have been merely
628,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"temporary. A large body of opinion was, at the outset, captivated by"
629,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,their arguments; it has of late tended to swing back towards some
630,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"approximation to the old orthodoxy. There is, indeed, much difficulty in"
631,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,conceiving the profound and essential unity apparent to unprejudiced
632,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,readers of the Iliad and Odyssey to be illusory; nor should it be
633,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,forgotten that the evoking of a cosmos from a chaos implies a single
634,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,regulative intelligence. And a cosmos each poem might very well be
635,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"called; while the ‘embryon atoms’ from which they sprang, of legends,"
636,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"stories, myths, and traditions, constituted scarcely less than an"
637,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
638,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Ocean without bound,"
639,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Without dimension; where length, breadth, and highth,"
640,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"And time, and place, are lost."
641,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
642,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"The Odyssey and the Iliad, however, stand in this respect by no means on"
643,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the same footing. In the former, fundamental unity is obvious; the"
644,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,development of the plot is logical and continuous; there are no
645,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"considerable redundancies, no superfluous adventures, no oblivious"
646,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,interludes; the sense of progress towards a purposed end pervades the
647,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"whole. Careful scrutiny, it is true, detects, in the details of the"
648,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"narrative, some few trifling discrepancies; but attempts to remove them"
649,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,by tampering with the general plan of its structure lead at once to
650,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,intolerable anomalies. So much cannot be said for the Iliad. Here the
651,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"component strata are manifestly dislocated, and some intruded masses can"
652,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,be clearly identified. Thus the Tenth Book at once detaches itself both
653,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,in substance and style from the remaining cantos. It narrates an
654,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"adventure wholly disconnected from the main action unfolded in them, and"
655,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,narrates it with a coolness and easy fluency very unlike the rush and
656,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"glow of genuine Iliadic verse. Few, accordingly, are the critics who"
657,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"venture to claim the episode, brilliant and interesting though it be, as"
658,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,an integral part of the original poem. Yet even when it has been set
659,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"aside, things do not go altogether straight. The basis of the story is"
660,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,furnished by the wrath of Achilles and its direful consequences; but
661,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"while the hero sulks in his tent, a good deal of miscellaneous and"
662,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"largely irrespective fighting proceeds, during which he sinks out of"
663,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"sight, and is only transiently kept in mind. Zeus himself is allowed to"
664,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"forget his solemn promise to Thetis of avenging, through the defeat of"
665,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the Greeks, the injury done to her son by Agamemnon; and the Olympian"
666,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,machinery generally works in an ill-regulated and haphazard fashion.
667,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Moreover, the embassy of conciliation in the Ninth Book is ignored later"
668,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"on; while the Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Books, devoted mainly to"
669,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the obsequies of Patroclus and Hector, have by some critics been deemed"
670,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"superfluous, by others inconsistent with an exordium announcing—as Pope"
671,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,has it—
672,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
673,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,The wrath that hurled to Pluto’s gloomy reign
674,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain,"
675,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Whose limbs unburied by the naked shore,"
676,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.
677,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
678,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Through the weight of these objections, Mr. Grote felt compelled to"
679,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"dissever the Iliad into a primitive part, which he called the Achilleid,"
680,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"and a mass of accessional poetry, most likely of diverse origin and"
681,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,date. And a similar view still prevails. Only that the Achilleid has
682,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"been cut down, by further retrenchments, to the compass of a somewhat"
683,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"prolix Lay, treating, as its express subject, of the ‘Wrath’ of"
684,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Achilles. Dr. Leaf indeed accentuates the separation by upholding the
685,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"probable origin, on opposite sides of the Ægean, of the nuclear and"
686,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,adventitious portions of the Epic.
687,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
688,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,The force of some of the arguments urging to this analysis cannot be
689,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"denied, yet there are others, perhaps of a higher order of importance,"
690,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,which indicate the former predominance of a partially destroyed entirety
691,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,of design through by far the larger portion of this wonderful
692,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"prehistoric work. Speaking broadly, an identical spirit pervades the"
693,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"whole. The Tenth Book, and a few notoriously interpolated passages, such"
694,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"as the feeble and futile Theomachy, make the sole exceptions to this"
695,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"rule of ethical homogeneity. Elsewhere, from beginning to end, we meet"
696,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the same spontaneous fervour of expression, the same magnificent energy"
697,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,kept in hand like a spirited steed; an unfailing sense of the splendour
698,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"of heroic achievement, and a glowing joy in human existence, tempered by"
699,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,the heart-thrilling remembrance of its pathetic mystery of sorrow. This
700,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,prevalent uniformity in manner and spirit is certainly unfavourable to
701,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,the hypothesis of divided authorship.
702,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
703,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,The marvellous beauty and power of those sections of the poem believed
704,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,to be adventitious is also a circumstance to be considered. They include
705,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"many of its most famous scenes—the parting of Hector and Andromache, the"
706,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"arming of Athene, the meeting of Glaucus and Diomed, and the whole vivid"
707,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"interlude of Diomed’s prowess, the orations in the tent of Achilles, the"
708,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"chariot-race, the reception of Priam as his suppliant by the fierce"
709,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"slayer of his son. To them exclusively, above all, belongs the personal"
710,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"presentation of Helen; outside their limits, she has no place in the"
711,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Iliad.
712,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
713,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"These same accretions are not merely magnificent in themselves, and rich"
714,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"in shining incidents, but they add incalculably to the general effect of"
715,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the Epic. They contribute, in fact, a great part of its dramatic force"
716,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,and the whole of its moral purport. Without them it would be a bald and
717,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,unfinished performance—the abortive realisation of a sublime conception.
718,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"The arming of Agamemnon, for instance, and his feats of private valour,"
719,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,could never have been designed as the immediate sequel to the Promise of
720,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Zeus; while they constitute a most fitting climax to the series of the
721,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,baffled Greek efforts for victory. They are admirably prepared for by
722,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the stories of the duel between Menelaus and Paris, of the broken pact,"
723,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"of the prowess of Diomed, of the nocturnal embassy to Achilles."
724,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Moreover, the irresistible might of Pelides is brought with tenfold"
725,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,impressiveness on the scene after the fighting powers of each of the
726,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"other Achæan chiefs have been fully displayed, and proved fruitless."
727,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Above all, the Achillean drama itself would lose its profound"
728,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,significance by the retrenchment of the Ninth and two closing Books. For
729,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,it was the implacability of the ‘swift-footed’ hero that was justly
730,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,punished by the calamity of the death of Patroclus; and he showed
731,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,himself implacable only when he haughtily rejected a formal offer of
732,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,ample reparation.[13] At that point he became culpable; and might only
733,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,win revenge at the cost of the acutest anguish of which his nature was
734,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"capable. The Ninth Book, in short, constitutes the ethical crisis of the"
735,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Iliad; and the moralising at second-hand, to the innermost core of its"
736,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"structure, of a work purporting to be already complete, is certainly a"
737,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"unique, if not an impossible phenomenon."

739,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Footnote 13:
740,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
741,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Mr. A. Lang urges this point with great effect in an article on ‘Homer
742,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"and the Higher Criticism’ (_National Review_, Feb. 1892), published"
743,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,after the present Chapter had been sent to press.
744,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
745,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Nor is it easily credible that the ransom of the body of Hector made no
746,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,part of its fundamental plan. Greek feelings of propriety would have
747,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,been outraged—and outraged in the most distasteful way—by disregard of
748,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the dying petition of so spotless and disinterested a champion, albeit"
749,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"of a lost cause, and by the abandonment of his body as carrion to"
750,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"unclean beasts and birds. And Achilles, without the elevating traits of"
751,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"his courtesies in the Games, and his pity for Priam, would have remained"
752,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"colossal only in brutality, a blind instrument of fury, an example of"
753,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,the triumph of ignoble instincts. But such a presentation of his
754,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,character could never have been purposed by the author of the First
755,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Iliad. Not of this base stamp was the hero whom Thetis rose from the sea
756,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"to comfort. For even in the first rush of his tremendous passion, he"
757,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,still saw the radiant eyes and listened to the voice of Athene; he did
758,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,not wholly desert celestial wisdom; and celestial wisdom could never
759,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,have suffered the balance of his stormy soul to be finally overthrown.
760,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,But just the needed compensatory touches are supplied by his noble
761,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"bearing in the Patroclean celebration, and far more, by his chivalrous"
762,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,compassion for the hapless old king of Troy. They could not have been
763,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"omitted by a poet of supreme genius—could not, since the imagination has"
764,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"its logical necessities, among which may be reckoned that of"
765,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,_equilibration_. There is accordingly no possibility of founding a truly
766,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"great poem, wholly, or mainly, on the crude brutalities of actual"
767,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,warfare. Humanity revolts from them in the long run; and humanity
768,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,prescribes its laws to art. The slaughtering rage of Achilles demands a
769,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,corresponding height of generosity and depth of pity; it would else be
770,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"atrocious. His wrath, in fact, postulates his tenderness; and hence the"
771,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,great difficulty in believing that the singer of the First Book failed
772,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"to insert the Ninth, or stopped short at the Twenty-second Book of the"
773,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Iliad.
774,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
775,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"The upshot of our little discussion, then, is to assign both to the"
776,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Iliad and Odyssey a European origin, in the pre-Dorian time, when Mycenæ"
777,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"was the political centre of the Achæan world. Provisionally, they may be"
778,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"said to date from the eleventh century B.C. Moreover, the Odyssey in its"
779,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"essential integrity, and the Iliad in large part, are each the work of"
780,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"one master-mind. The Iliad, none the less, can no longer be said to"
781,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"present a poem ‘of one projection’; it shows seams, and junctures, and"
782,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"discrepancies; its mass has, perhaps, been broken up and awkwardly"
783,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"pieced together again; it is a building, in fact, which has suffered"
784,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,extensive restoration.
785,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
786,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,The further question remains as to the united or divided authorship of
787,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"these antique monuments, regarded as separate wholes. Are they"
788,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"twin-productions, or did they spring up independently, favoured by the"
789,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"same prevailing climate, from a soil similarly prepared? The answer may"
790,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"be left to the dispassionate judgment of any ordinary, uncritical"
791,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"reader. Supposing his mind, _per impossibile_, a blank on the point, it"
792,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,would certainly not occur to him to attribute the two poems to a single
793,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"individual. They are probably as unlike in style as, under the"
794,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"circumstances, it was possible for them to be. A great deal, indeed,"
795,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,belongs to them in common. They were rooted in the same traditions; they
796,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,arose under the same sky and in the same ideal atmosphere; the
797,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,inexhaustible storehouse of their legendary raw material was the same.
798,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Strictly analogous conditions of politics and society are depicted in
799,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,them; they were addressed to similarly constituted audiences; their
800,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"verses were constructed on the same rhythmical model. Moreover, the"
801,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,author of one was familiar with the grand example set him by the other.
802,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Yet the temper and spirit of each are profoundly different. In the
803,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Iliad, a magnificent ardour prevails; the singer is aflame with his"
804,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,theme; his words glow; vivid impressions crowd upon his mind; it takes
805,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,all the power of his genius to restrain their riotous audacity and
806,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"marshal them into orderly succession. The author of the Odyssey, on the"
807,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"other hand, is in no danger of being swept away by the impetuosity of"
808,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,his thoughts. He is always collected and at leisure; he has even
809,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"_esprit_, which implies a low mental temperature; he can stand by with a"
810,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"smile, and look on, while his characters unfold themselves; his passion"
811,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"never blazes; it is smouldering and sustained, like that of his"
812,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,protagonist.
813,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
814,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Numerous small discrepancies, besides, seem to betray a personal"
815,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"diversity of origin. So Iris, the frequent, indeed the all but"
816,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"invariable messenger of the gods in the Iliad, drops into oblivion in"
817,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the Odyssey, and is replaced by Hermes; Charis is the wife of Hephæstus"
818,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"in the Iliad, Aphrodite in the Odyssey; Neleus has twelve sons in the"
819,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Iliad, three in the Odyssey; Pylos is a district in the Iliad, a town in"
820,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,the Odyssey; the oracle of the Dodonæan Zeus is located in Thessaly in
821,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the Iliad, in Epirus in the Odyssey, and so on.[14] The Odyssey,"
822,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"moreover, is obviously junior to the Iliad. It gives evidence of an"
823,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,appreciable development of the arts of life relatively to their state in
824,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,the rival poem; the processes of verbal contraction have advanced in the
825,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,interval; the ethical standard has become more refined; while formulaic
826,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"and other expressions common to both are unmistakably ‘in place,’ as"
827,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"geologists say, in the Iliad, ‘erratic,’ or ‘transported,’ in the"
828,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Odyssey.

835,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"A difference in the place of origin, perhaps, helps to accentuate the"

840,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"subverted by the irrepressible Dorians. The Iliad, however, contains"
841,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,strong internal evidence of owning Thessaly as its native region. The
842,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"vast pre-eminence of the local hero, the Olympian seat of the gods, the"
843,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"partiality displayed for the horse, intimacy with Thessalian traditions"
844,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"and topography, all suggest the relationship. The name of Thessaly, it"
845,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"is true, does not occur either in the Iliad or in the Odyssey; nor had"
846,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"the semi-barbarous Thessalians, when they were composed, as yet crossed"
847,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,the mountains from Thesprotia to trample down the Achæan culture of the
848,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"land of Achilles. It thus became, after Homer’s time, the scene of a"
849,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,revolution analogous in every respect to that which overwhelmed the
850,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,Peloponnesus.
851,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,
852,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"The Homer of the Odyssey, who was not improbably of Peloponnesian birth,"
853,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,must have travelled widely. He had undeniably some personal acquaintance
854,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"with Ithaca, his topographical indications, apart from the gross blunder"
855,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"of planting the little island west, instead of east of Cephalonia,"
856,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,corresponding on the whole quite closely with reality. And he knew
857,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"something besides of most parts of the mainland of Greece, of Crete,"
858,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Delos, Chios, and the Ionian coast of Asia Minor. The experience of the"
859,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Iliadic bard was doubtless somewhat, though not greatly, more limited."
860,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Its range extended, at any rate, from ‘Pelasgic Argos’ to the Troad,"
861,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,familiarity with which is shown in all sections of the Trojan epic. The
862,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,cosmopolitan character of both poets is only indeed what might have been
863,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,expected. The privileged members of an Achæan community must have
864,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,enjoyed wide opportunities of observation. For Mycenæan culture was
865,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"strongly eclectic. Elements from many quarters were amalgamated in it,"
866,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"Asiatic influences, however, predominating. The men of genius who acted"
867,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,as the interpreters of its typical ideas would hence have been unfit for
868,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,their task unless they had personally tried and proved all such elements
869,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,and influences. They were presumably to some extent adventurers by sea
870,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,"and land. But, further than this, their individuality remains shrouded"
871,HOMER AS A POET AND AS A PROBLEM.,in the impenetrable veil of their silence.

883,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
884,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,THE Homeric ideas regarding the heavenly bodies were of the simplest
885,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"description. They stood, in fact, very much on the same level with those"
886,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"entertained by the North American Indians, when first brought into"
887,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,European contact. What knowledge there was in them was of that ‘broken’
888,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,kind which (in Bacon’s phrase) is made up of wonder. Fragments of
889,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"observation had not even begun to be pieced in one with the other, and"
890,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"so fitted, ill or well, into a whole. In other words, there was no"
891,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,faintest dawning of a celestial science.
892,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
893,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"But surely, it may be urged, a poet is not bound to be an astronomer."
894,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Why should it be assumed that the author (or authors) of the Iliad and
895,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Odyssey possessed information co-extensive on all points with that of
896,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"his fellow-countrymen? His profession was not science, but song. The"
897,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"argument, however, implies a reflecting backward of the present upon the"
898,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"past. Among unsophisticated peoples, specialists, unless in the matter"
899,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"of drugs or spells, or some few practical processes, do not exist. The"
900,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"scanty stock of gathered knowledge is held, it might be said, in common."
901,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,The property of one is the property of all.
902,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
903,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,More especially of the poet. His power over his hearers depends upon his
904,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,presenting vividly what they already perceive dimly. It was part of the
905,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,poetical faculty of the Ithacan bard Phemius that he ‘knew the works of
906,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,gods and men.’[15] His special function was to render them famous by his
907,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"song. What he had heard concerning them he repeated; adding, of his own,"
908,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the marshalling skill, the vital touch, by which they were perpetuated."
909,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"He was no inventor: the actual life of men, with its transfiguring"
910,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"traditions and baffled aspirations, was the material he had to work"
911,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,with. But the life of men was very different then from what it is now.
912,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"It was lived in closer contact with Nature; it was simpler, more"
913,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"typical, consequently more susceptible of artistic treatment."

917,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"_Odyssey_, i. 338."
918,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
919,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,It was accordingly looked at and portrayed as a whole; and it is this
920,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,very _wholeness_ which is one of the principal charms of primitive
921,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,poetry—an irrecoverable charm; for civilisation renders existence a
922,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"labyrinth of which it too often rejects the clue. In olden times,"
923,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"however, its ways were comparatively straight, and its range limited. It"
924,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,was accordingly capable of being embraced with approximate entirety.
925,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Hence the encyclopædic character of the early epics. _Humani nihil
926,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"alienum._ Whatever men thought, and knew, and did, in that morning of"
927,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the world when they spontaneously arose, found a place in them."
928,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
929,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Now, some scheme of the heavens must always accompany and guide human"
930,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,existence. There is literally no choice for man but to observe the
931,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"movements, real or apparent, of celestial objects, and to regulate his"
932,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,actions by the measure of time they mete out to him. Nor had he at first
933,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,any other means of directing his wanderings upon the earth save by
934,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,regarding theirs in the sky. They are thus to him standards of reference
935,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,and measurement as regards both the fundamental conditions of his
936,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,being—time and space.
937,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
938,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"This intimate connexion, and, still more, the idealising influence of"
939,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the remote and populous skies, has not been lost upon the poets in any"
940,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,age. It might even be possible to construct a tolerably accurate
941,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,outline-sketch of the history of astronomy in Europe without travelling
942,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,outside the limits of their works. But our present concern is with
943,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Homer.
944,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
945,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"To begin with his mode of reckoning time. This was by years, months,"
946,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"days, and hours.[16] The week of seven days was unknown to him; but in"
947,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,its place we find[17] the triplicate division of the month used by
948,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Hesiod and the later Attics, implying a month of thirty, and a year of"
949,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"360 days, corrected, doubtless, by some rude process of intercalation."
950,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,These ten-day intervals were perhaps borrowed at an early stage of
951,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Achæan civilisation from Egypt, where they correspond to the Chaldean"
952,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,‘decans’—thirty-six minor astral divinities presiding over as many
953,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,sections of the Zodiac.[18] But no knowledge of the Signs accompanied
954,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,the transfer. A similar apportionment of the hours of night into three
955,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"watches (as amongst the Jews before the Captivity), and of the hours of"
956,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"day into three periods or stages, prevails in both the Iliad and"
957,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Odyssey. The seasons of the year, too, were three—spring, summer, and"
958,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,winter—like those of the ancient Egyptians and of our Anglo-Saxon
959,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"forefathers;[19] for the Homeric _Opora_ was not, properly speaking, an"
960,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"autumnal season, but merely an aggravation of summer heat and drought,"
961,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"heralded by the rising of Sirius towards the close of July. It, in fact,"
962,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"strictly matched our ‘dog-days,’ the _dies caniculares_ of the Romans."
963,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,The first direct mention of autumn is in a treatise of the time of
964,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Alcibiades ascribed to Hippocrates.[20] This rising of the dog-star is
965,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,the only indication in the Homeric poems of the use of a stellar
966,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,calendar such as we meet full-grown in Hesiod’s Works and Days. The same
967,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"event was the harbinger of the Nile-flood to the Egyptians, serving to"
968,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,mark the opening of their year as well as to correct the estimates of
969,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,its length.

998,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"effacements by, and re-emergences from, the solar beams, of certain"
999,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"well-known stars, as the sun pursued his yearly course amongst them,"
1000,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,than to note the epochs of such events. Four stages in these periodical
1001,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,fluctuations of visibility were especially marked by primitive
1002,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,observers. The first perceptible appearance of a star in the dawn was
1003,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,known as its ‘heliacal rising.’ This brief glimpse extended gradually as
1004,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the star increased its seeming distance from the sun, the interval of"
1005,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,precedence in rising lengthening by nearly four minutes each morning. At
1006,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the end of close upon six months occurred its ‘acronycal rising,’ or"
1007,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,last visible ascent from the eastern horizon after sunset. Its
1008,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"conspicuousness was then at the maximum, the whole of the dark hours"
1009,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,being available for its shining. To these two epochs of rising succeeded
1010,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,and corresponded two epochs of setting—the ‘cosmical’ and the
1011,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"‘heliacal.’ A star set cosmically when, for the first time each year, it"
1012,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,reached the horizon long enough before break of day to be still
1013,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,distinguishable; it set heliacally on the last evening when its rays
1014,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,still detached themselves from the background of illuminated western
1015,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"sky, before getting finally immersed in twilight. The round began again"
1016,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,when the star had arrived sufficiently far on the other side of the sun
1017,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"to show in the morning—in other words, to rise heliacally."
1018,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1019,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Wide plains and clear skies gave opportunities for closely and
1020,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,continually observing these successive moments in the revolving
1021,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"relations of sun and stars, which were soon found to afford a very"
1022,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"accurate index to the changes of the seasons. By them, for the most"
1023,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"part, Hesiod’s prescriptions for navigation and agriculture are timed;"
1024,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"and although Homer, in conformity with the nature of his subject, is"
1025,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"less precise, he was still fully aware of the association."
1026,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1027,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"His sun is a god—Helios—as yet unidentified with Apollo, who wears his"
1028,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"solar attributes unconsciously. Helios is also known as Hyperion, ‘he"
1029,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"who walks on high,’ and Elector, ‘the shining one.’ Voluntarily he"
1030,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"pursues his daily course in the sky, and voluntarily he sinks to rest in"
1031,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the ocean-stream—subject, however, at times to a higher compulsion; for,"
1032,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"just after the rescue of the body of Patroclus, Heré favours her Achæan"
1033,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,clients by precipitating at a critical juncture the descent of a still
1034,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"unwearied and unwilling luminary.[21] On another occasion, however,"
1035,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Helios memorably asserts his independence, when, incensed at the"
1036,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"slaughter of his sacred cattle by the self-doomed companions of Ulysses,"
1037,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"he threatens to ‘descend into Hades, and shine among the dead.’[22] And"
1038,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Zeus, in promising the required satisfaction, virtually admits his power"
1039,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,to abdicate his office as illuminator of gods and men.

1056,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"comprised angle being 15⅓°, instead of 23½°.[24] To those early students"
1057,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"of nature, the travelling to and fro of the points of sunrise and sunset"

1103,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,illustrative fitness of its details. The multitudinous effect of a
1104,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,thousand fires blazing together on the plain inevitably suggested the
1105,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,stars. But with the stars came the complete nocturnal scene in its
1106,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"profound and breathless tranquillity. The ‘rejoicing shepherd,’"
1107,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"meantime, who was part of it, would have been ill-pleased with the"

1111,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"satisfaction and the safety of his flock, as well as for the perfecting"
1112,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,of that scenic beauty felt to be deficient where human needs were left
1113,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"uncared for. Just in proportion, however, as rocks, and peaks, and"
1114,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"wooded glens appeared distinct, the lesser lights of heaven, and with"
1115,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"them the fundamental idea of the comparison, must have become effaced;"
1116,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"and the poet, accordingly, as if with a misgiving that the fervour of"
1117,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"his fancy had led him to stray from the rigid line of his purpose,"
1118,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"volunteered the assurance that ‘all the stars were visible’—as, to his"

1120,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1121,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Of the ‘vivid planets’ thrown in by Pope there is no more trace in the

1123,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,was totally ignorant that such a class of bodies existed. This curious
1124,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,fact affords (if it were needed) conclusive proof of the high antiquity
1125,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,of the Homeric poems. Not the faintest suspicion manifests itself in
1126,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"them that Hesperus, ‘fairest of all stars set in heaven,’ is but another"
1127,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"aspect of Phosphorus, herald of light upon the earth, ‘the star that"

1129,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,The identification is said by Diogenes Laertius to have been first made
1130,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,by Pythagoras; and it may at any rate be assumed with some confidence
1131,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,that this elementary piece of astronomical knowledge came to the Greeks
1132,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"from the East, with others of a like nature, in the course of the"
1133,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,seventh or sixth century B.C. Astonishing as it seems that they should
1134,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"not have made the discovery for themselves, there is no evidence that"
1135,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,they did so. Hesiod appears equally unconscious with Homer of the
1136,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,distinction between ‘fixed’ and ‘wandering’ stars. According to his
1137,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"genealogical information, Phosphorus, like the rest of the stellar"
1138,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"multitude, sprang from the union of Astræus with the Dawn,[27] but no"

1184,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Independently of extrinsic evidence, the verses in the Iliad have the"
1185,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"strong spontaneous ring of originality, while the Odyssean lines betray"
1186,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,excision and interpolation. The ‘Hyads and Orion’s might’ are suppressed
1187,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,for the sake of introducing Boötes. Variety was doubtless aimed at in
1188,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the change; and the conjecture is at least a plausible one, that the"
1189,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,added constellation may have been known to the poet of the Odyssey
1190,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"(admitting the hypothesis of a divided authorship), though not to the"
1191,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"poet of the Iliad—known, that is, in the sense that the stars comprising"
1192,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the figure of the celestial Husbandman had not yet, at the time and"
1193,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"place of origin of the Iliad, become separated from the anonymous throng"
1194,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,circling in the ‘murk of night.’
1195,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1196,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"The constellation Boötes—called ‘late-setting,’ probably from the"
1197,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,perpendicular position in which it descends below the horizon—was
1198,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"invented to drive the Wain, as Arctophylax to guard the Bear, the same"
1199,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,group in each case going by a double name. For the brightest of the
1200,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,stars thus designated we still preserve the appellation Arcturus (from
1201,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"_arktos_, bear, _oûros_, guardian), first used by Hesiod, who fixed upon"
1202,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"its acronycal rising, sixty days after the winter solstice, as the"
1203,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,signal for pruning the vines.[30] It is not unlikely that the star
1204,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"received its name long before the constellation was thought of, forming"
1205,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,the nucleus of a subsequently formed group. This was undoubtedly the
1206,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"course of events elsewhere; the Great and Little Dogs, for instance, the"
1207,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Twins, and the Eagle (the last with two minute companions) having been"
1208,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,individualised as stars previous to their recognition as asterisms.

1213,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1214,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,There is reason to believe that the stars enumerated in the Iliad and
1215,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Odyssey constituted the whole of those known by name to the early
1216,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Greeks. This view is strongly favoured by the identity of the Homeric
1217,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"and Hesiodic stars. It is difficult to believe that, had there been room"
1218,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"for choice, the same list _precisely_ would have been picked out for"
1219,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,presentation in poems so widely diverse in scope and origin as the Iliad
1220,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"and Odyssey on the one side, and the Works and Days on the other. As"
1221,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"regards the polar constellations, we have positive proof that none"
1222,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,besides Ursa Major had been distinguished. For the statement repeated in
1223,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"both the Homeric epics, that the Bear _alone_ was without part in the"
1224,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"baths of Ocean, implies, not that the poet veritably ignored the"
1225,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,unnumbered stars revolving within the circle traced out round the pole
1226,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"by the seven of the Plough, but that they still remained a nameless"
1227,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"crowd, unassociated with any terrestrial object, and therefore"
1228,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,attracting no popular observation.
1229,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1230,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"The Greeks, according to a well-attested tradition, made acquaintance"
1231,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"with the Lesser Bear through Phœnician communication, of which Thales"
1232,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,was the medium. Hence the designation of the group as _Phoinike_. Aratus
1233,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"(who versified the prose of Eudoxus) has accordingly two Bears, lying"
1234,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,(in sailors’ phrase) ‘heads and points’ on the sphere; while he
1235,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,expressly states that the Greeks still (about 270 B.C.) continued to
1236,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"steer by _Helike_ (the Twister, Ursa Major), while the expert Phœnicians"
1237,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,directed their course by the less mobile _Kynosoura_ (Ursa Minor). The
1238,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,absence of any mention of a Pole-star seems at first sight surprising.
1239,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Even the Iroquois Indians directed their wanderings from of old by the
1240,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,one celestial luminary of which the position remained sensibly
1241,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"invariable.[31] Yet not the gods themselves, in Homer’s time, were aware"
1242,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"of such a guide. It must be remembered, however, that the axis of the"
1243,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"earth’s rotation pointed, 2800 years ago, towards a considerably"
1244,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,different part of the heavens from that now met by its imaginary
1245,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,prolongation. The precession of the equinoxes has been at work in the
1246,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"interval, slowly but unremittingly shifting the situation of this point"
1247,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"among the stars. Some 600 years before the Great Pyramid was built, it"
1248,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,was marked by the close vicinity of the brightest star in the Dragon.
1249,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,But this in the course of ages was left behind by the onward-travelling
1250,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"pole, and further ages elapsed before the star at the tip of the Little"
1251,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Bear’s tail approached its present position. Thus the entire millennium
1252,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,before the Christian era may count for an interregnum as regards
1253,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Pole-stars. Alpha Draconis had ceased to exercise that office;
1254,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Alruccabah had not yet assumed it.

1259,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1260,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,The most ancient of all the constellations is probably that which Homer
1261,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,distinguishes as never-setting (it then lay much nearer to the pole than
1262,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"it now does). In his time, as in ours, it went by two appellations—the"
1263,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Bear and the Wain. Homer’s Bear, however, included the same seven bright"
1264,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"stars constituting the Wain, and no more; whereas our Great Bear"
1265,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"stretches over a sky-space of which the Wain is only a small part, three"
1266,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,of the striding monster’s far-apart paws being marked by the three pairs
1267,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,of stars known to the Arabs as the ‘gazelle’s springs.’ How this
1268,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"extension came about, we can only conjecture; but there is evidence that"
1269,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,it was fairly well established when Aratus wrote his description of the
1270,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"constellations. Aratus, however, copied Eudoxus, and Eudoxus used"
1271,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,observations made—doubtless by Accad or Chaldean astrologers—above 2000
1272,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"B.C.[32] We infer, then, that the Babylonian Bear was no other than the"
1273,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,modern Ursa Major.[33]
1274,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1275,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Footnote 32:

1284,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"But the primitive asterism—the Seven Rishis of the old Hindus, the"
1285,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Septem Triones of the Latins, the Arktos of Homer—included no more than"
1286,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,seven stars. And this is important as regards the origin of the name.
1287,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,For it is impossible to suppose a likeness to any animal suggested by
1288,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,the more restricted group. Scarcely the acquiescent fancy of Polonius
1289,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"could find it ‘backed like a weasel,’ or ‘very like a whale.’ Yet a"
1290,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"weasel or a whale would match the figure equally well with, or better"
1291,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"than, a bear. Probably the growing sense of incongruity between the name"
1292,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,and the object it signified may have induced the attempt to soften it
1293,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,down by gathering a number of additional stars into a group presenting a
1294,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,distant resemblance to a four-legged monster.
1295,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1296,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"The name of the Bear, this initial difficulty notwithstanding, is"
1297,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,prehistoric and quasi-universal. It was traditional amongst the
1298,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"American-Indian tribes, who, however, sensible of the absurdity of"
1299,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,attributing a conspicuous protruding tail to an animal almost destitute
1300,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"of such an appendage, turned the three stars composing it into three"
1301,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"pursuing hunters. No such difficulty, however, presented itself to the"
1302,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Aztecs. They recognised in the seven ‘Arctic’ stars the image of a
1303,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Scorpion,[34] and named them accordingly. No Bear seems to have"
1304,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,bestridden their sky.

1312,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"there is no certainty as to the original meaning of this word, which has"
1313,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"no longer a current application to any terrestrial object, it is"
1314,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,impossible not to be struck with its resemblance to the Iroquois term
1315,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"_Okowari_, signifying ‘bear,’ both zoologically and astronomically.[35]"
1316,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"The inference seems justified that _Otawa_ held the same two meanings,"

1339,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,true origin of which was lost in the mists of antiquity.
1340,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1341,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"There is, on the other hand, no difficulty in understanding how the"
1342,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Seven Stars obtained their second title of the Wain, or Plough, or Bier."
1343,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Here we have a plain case of imitative name-giving—a suggestion by
1344,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,resemblance almost as direct as that which established in our skies a
1345,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Triangle and a Northern Crown. Curiously enough, the individual"
1346,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"appellations still current for the stars of the Plough, include a"
1347,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,reminiscence of each system of nomenclature—the legendary and the
1348,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"imitative. The brightest of the seven, _α_ Ursæ Majoris, the Pointer"
1349,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"nearest the Pole, is designated _Dubhe_, signifying, in Arabic, ‘bear’;"
1350,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"while the title _Benetnasch_—equivalent to _Benât-en-Nasch_, ‘daughters"
1351,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"of the bier’—of the furthest star in the plough-handle, perpetuates the"
1352,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"lugubrious fancy, native in Arabia, by which the group figures as a"
1353,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,corpse attended by three mourners.
1354,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1355,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Turning to the second great constellation mentioned in both Homeric
1356,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"epics, we again meet traces of remote and unconscious tradition: yet"
1357,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"less remote, probably, than that concerned with the Bear—certainly less"
1358,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,inscrutable; for recent inquiries into the lore and language of ancient
1359,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Babylon have thrown much light on the relationships of the Orion fable.
1360,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1361,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,There seems no reason to question the validity of Mr. Robert Brown’s
1362,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"interpretation of the word by the Accadian _Ur-ana_, ‘light of"
1363,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,heaven.’[37] But a proper name is significant only where it originates.
1364,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Moreover, it is considered certain that the same brilliant star-group"
1365,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"known to Homer no less than to us as Orion, was termed by"
1366,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Chaldeo-Assyrian peoples ‘Tammuz,’[38] a synonym of Adonis. Nor is it"
1367,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"difficult to divine how the association came to be established. For,"
1368,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"about 2000 B.C., when the Euphratean constellations assumed their"
1369,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"definitive forms, the belt of Orion began to be visible before dawn in"
1370,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the month of June, called ‘Tammuz,’ because the death of Adonis was then"
1371,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,celebrated. It is even conceivable that the heliacal rising of the
1372,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,asterism may originally have given the signal for that celebration. We
1373,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,can at any rate scarcely doubt that it received the name of ‘Tammuz’
1374,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,because its annual emergence from the solar beams coincided with the
1375,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,period of mystical mourning for the vernal sun.

1385,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Orion, too, has solar connexions. In the Fifth Odyssey (121-24), Calypso"
1386,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,relates to Hermes how the love for him of Aurora excited the jealousy of
1387,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the gods, extinguished only when he fell a victim to it, slain by the"
1388,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"shafts of Artemis in Ortygia. Obviously, a sun-and-dawn myth slightly"
1389,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"modified from the common type. The post-Homeric stories, too, of his"

1391,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"scorpion (emblematical of darkness, like the boar’s tusk in the Adonis"
1392,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"legend), confirm his position as a luminous hero.[39] Altogether, the"
1393,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,evidence is strongly in favour of considering Orion as a variant of
1394,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Adonis, imported into Greece from the East at an early date, and there"
1395,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,associated with the identical group of stars which commemorated to the

1408,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"beloved of the Dawn, the mighty hunter, surpassing in beauty of person"
1409,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,even the divinely-born Aloidæ—died and descended to Hades like other

1411,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"wild beasts together over the mead of asphodel, the very beasts which he"
1412,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"himself had slain on the lonely hills, with a strong mace all of bronze"
1413,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"in his hand, that is ever unbroken.’[40] His stellar connexion is"

1509,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1510,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,The point of most significance about Homer’s scanty astronomical notions
1511,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,is that they were of home growth. They are precisely such as would arise
1512,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"among a people in an incipient stage of civilisation, simple, direct,"
1513,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"and childlike in their mode of regarding natural phenomena, yet"
1514,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,incapable of founding upon them any close or connected reasoning. Of
1515,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Oriental mysticism there is not a vestige. No occult influences rain
1516,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,from the sky. Not so much as a square inch of foundation is laid for the
1517,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,astrological superstructure. It is true that Sirius is a ‘baleful star’;
1518,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"but it is in the sense of being a harbinger of hot weather. Possibly, or"
1519,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"probably, it is regarded as a concomitant cause, no less than as a sign"
1520,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,of the August droughts; indeed the _post hoc_ and the _propter hoc_
1521,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"were, in those ages, not easily separable; the effect, however, in any"
1522,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"case, was purely physical, and so unfit to become the starting-point of"
1523,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,a superstition.
1524,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1525,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"The Homeric names of the stars, too, betray common reminiscences rather"
1526,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"than foreign intercourse. They are all either native, or naturalised on"
1527,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Greek soil. The transplanted fable of Orion has taken root and
1528,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,flourished there. The cosmopolitan Bear is known by her familiar Greek
1529,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"name. Boötes is a Greek husbandman, variously identified with Arcas, son"
1530,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"of Callisto, or with Icarus, the luckless mandatory of Dionysus. The"
1531,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Pleiades and the Hyades are intelligibly designated in Greek. The former
1532,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"word is usually derived from _pleîn_, to sail; the heliacal rising of"
1533,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the ‘tangled’ stars in the middle of May having served, from the time of"
1534,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Hesiod, to mark the opening of the season safe for navigation, and their"
1535,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"cosmical setting, at the end of October, its close. But this etymology"
1536,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,was most likely an after-thought. Long before rules for navigating the
1537,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Ægean came to be formulated, the ‘sailing-stars’ must have been"
1538,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"designated by name amongst the Achæan tribes. Besides, Homer is ignorant"
1539,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,of any such association. Now in Arabic the Pleiades are called _Eth
1540,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Thuraiyâ_, from _therwa_, copious, abundant. The meaning conveyed is"
1541,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,that of many gathered into a small space; and it is quite similar to
1542,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"that of the Biblical _kîmah_, a near connexion of the Assyrian _kimtu_,"
1543,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"family.[48] Analogy, then, almost irresistibly points to the"
1544,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"interpretation of Pleiades by the Greek _pleiones_, many, or _pleîos_,"
1545,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"full; giving to the term, in either case, the obvious signification of a"
1546,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,‘cluster.’

1552,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1553,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Of the Hyades, similarly, the ‘rainy’ association seems somewhat"
1554,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,far-fetched. They rise and set respectively about four days later than
1555,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the Pleiades; so that, as prognostics of the seasons, it would be"
1556,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,difficult to draw a permanent distinction between the two groups; yet
1557,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"one was traditionally held to bring fair, the other foul weather. There"
1558,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,can be little doubt that an etymological confusion lay at the bottom of
1559,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"this inconsistency. ‘To rain,’ in Greek is _huein_; but _hus_ (cognate"
1560,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"with ‘sow’) means a ‘pig.’ Moreover, in old Latin, the Hyades were"
1561,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,called _Suculæ_ (‘little pigs’); although the misapprehension which he
1562,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,supposed to be betrayed by the term was rebuked by Cicero.[49] Possibly
1563,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,the misapprehension was the other way. It is quite likely that ‘Suculæ’
1564,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"preserved the original meaning of ‘Hyades,’ and that the pluvious"
1565,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"derivation was invented at a later time, when the conception of the"
1566,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,seven stars in the head of the Bull as a ‘litter of pigs’ had come to
1567,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"appear incongruous and inelegant. It has, nevertheless, just that"
1568,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,character of _naïveté_ which stamps it as authentic. Witness the popular
1569,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"names of the sister-group—the widely-diffused ‘hen and chickens,’ Sancho"
1570,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Panza’s ‘las siete cabrillas,’ met and discoursed with during his famous"
1571,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"aërial voyage on the back of Clavileño, the Sicilian ‘seven"
1572,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"dovelets,’—all designating the Pleiades. Still more to the purpose is"
1573,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the Anglo-Saxon ‘boar-throng,’ which, by a haphazard identification, has"
1574,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"been translated as Orion, but which Grimm, on better grounds, suggests"
1575,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,may really apply to the Hyades.[50] It is scarcely credible that any
1576,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,other constellation can be indicated by a term so manifestly reproducing
1577,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,the ‘Suculæ’ of Latin and Sabine husbandmen.

1588,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,home. No stellar lore had as yet been imported from abroad. An original
1589,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,community of ideas is just traceable in the names of some of the stars;
1590,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,that is all. The epoch of instruction by more learned neighbours was
1591,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"still to come. The Signs of the Zodiac were certainly unknown to Homer,"
1592,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,yet their shining array had been marshalled from the banks of the
1593,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Euphrates at least 2000 years before the commencement of the Christian
1594,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,era. Their introduction into Greece is attributed to Cleostratus of
1595,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Tenedos, near, or shortly after, the end of the sixth century B.C. By"
1596,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"that time, too, acquaintance had been made with the ‘Phœnician’"
1597,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"constellation of the Lesser Bear, and with the wanderings of the"
1598,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"planets. Astronomical communications, in fact, began to pour into Hellas"
1599,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"from Egypt, Babylonia, and Phœnicia about the seventh century B.C. Now,"
1600,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,if there were any reasonable doubt that ‘blind Melesigenes’ lived at a
1601,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"period anterior to this, it would be removed by the consideration of"
1602,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"what he lets fall about the heavenly bodies. For, though he might have"
1603,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"ignored formal astronomy, he could not have remained unconscious of such"
1604,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"striking and popular facts as the identity of Hesperus and Phosphorus,"
1605,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the Sidonian pilots’ direction of their course by the ‘Cynosure,’ or the"
1606,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,mapping-out of the sun’s path among the stars by a series of luminous
1607,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,figures of beasts and men.
1608,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1609,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,Thus the hypothesis of a late origin for the Iliad and Odyssey is
1610,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"negatived by the astronomical ignorance betrayed in them. It has,"
1611,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"however, gradations; whence some hints as to the relative age of the two"
1612,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"epics may be derived. The differences between them in this respect are,"
1613,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"it is true, small, and they both stand approximately on the same"
1614,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,astronomical level with the poems of Hesiod. Yet an attentive study of
1615,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,what they have to tell us about the stars affords some grounds for
1616,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"placing the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Works and Days in a descending"
1617,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,series as to time.
1618,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1619,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"In the first place, the division of the month into three periods of ten"
1620,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"days each is unknown in the Iliad, is barely hinted at in the Odyssey,"
1621,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"but is brought into detailed notice in the Hesiodic calendar. Further,"
1622,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the ‘turning-points of the sun’ are unmentioned in the Iliad, but serve"
1623,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"in the Odyssey, by their position on the horizon, to indicate direction;"
1624,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,while the winter solstice figures as a well-marked epoch in the Works
1625,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"and Days. Hesiod, moreover, designates the dog-star (not expressly"
1626,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,mentioned in the Odyssey) by a name of which the author of the Iliad was
1627,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,certainly ignorant. Besides which an additional constellation (Boötes)
1628,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,to those named in the Iliad appears in the Odyssey and the Works and
1629,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Days; while the title ‘Hyperion,’ applied substantively to the sun in"
1630,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"the Odyssey, is used only adjectivally in the Iliad. Finally, stellar"
1631,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,mythology begins with Hesiod; Homer (whether the Iliadic or the
1632,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"Odyssean) takes the names of the stars as he finds them, without seeking"
1633,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,to connect them with any sublunary occurrences.
1634,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,
1635,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"To be sure, differences of place and purpose might account for some of"
1636,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"these discrepancies, yet their cumulative effect in fixing relative"
1637,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"epochs is considerable; and, even apart from chronology, it is something"
1638,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"to look towards the skies with the ‘most high poet,’ and to retrace,"
1639,HOMERIC ASTRONOMY.,"with the aid of our own better knowledge, the simple meanings their"

1653,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"TWO sets of strongly contrasted, nay, one might beforehand have thought"
1654,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"mutually exclusive qualities, go to make up the canine character. In all"
1655,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"ages, and amongst all nations, the dog has become a byword for its"
1656,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"uncleanly habits, disgusting voracity, its quarrelsome and aggressive"
1657,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"selfishness. The cynic, or ‘dog-like’ philosopher, is a type of what is"
1658,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"unamiable in human nature. Growling, snarling, whining, barking,"
1659,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"snapping and biting, crouching and fawning, constitute a vocabulary"
1660,THE DOG IN HOMER.,descriptive of canine deportment conveying none but repulsive and odious
1661,THE DOG IN HOMER.,associations. Our language pursues the animal through its different
1662,THE DOG IN HOMER.,varieties and stages of existence in order to find varying epithets of
1663,THE DOG IN HOMER.,contumely and reproach. The universal and almost prehistoric term of
1664,THE DOG IN HOMER.,abuse formed by the simple patronymic—so to speak—has lost little of its
1665,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"pristine favour, and none of its pristine force; while amongst ourselves"
1666,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"‘hound,’ ‘puppy,’ ‘cur,’ ‘whelp,’ and ‘cub,’ come in as harmonics of the"
1667,THE DOG IN HOMER.,fundamental note of insult.
1668,THE DOG IN HOMER.,
1669,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"On the other hand, some millenniums of experience have constituted the"
1670,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"dog a type of incorruptible fidelity, patient abnegation, devoted"
1671,THE DOG IN HOMER.,attachment reaching unto and beyond the grave. Many animals have been
1672,THE DOG IN HOMER.,made the slaves and victims of man; some have been found capable of
1673,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"becoming his willing allies; none, save the dog, affords to his master a"
1674,THE DOG IN HOMER.,true and intelligent companionship. Other members of the brute creation
1675,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"are subdued by domestication; the dog is, it might be said, transfigured"
1676,THE DOG IN HOMER.,by it. A new nature awakes in him. A higher ideal presents itself to
1677,THE DOG IN HOMER.,him. His dormant affections are kindled; his latent intelligence
1678,THE DOG IN HOMER.,develops. The overwhelming fascination of humanity submerges his native
1679,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"ignoble instincts, evokes virtues which man himself admires rather than"
1680,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"practises, engages a pathetic confidence, inspires an indomitable love."
1681,THE DOG IN HOMER.,Literature teems with instances of canine constancy and self-devotion.
1682,THE DOG IN HOMER.,The long life-in-death of ‘Grey Friars Bobby’ forms no prodigy in the
1683,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"history of his race. From the dog of Colophon to the dog of Bairnsdale,"
1684,THE DOG IN HOMER.,man’s four-footed friend has been found capable of the supreme sacrifice
1685,THE DOG IN HOMER.,which one living creature can make for another. Even in the dim dawnings
1686,THE DOG IN HOMER.,of civilisation this animal was chosen as the symbol of watchful
1687,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"attendance and untiring subordination. The bright star Sirius, owing to"
1688,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"its close waiting on the ‘giant’ of the skies, was from the earliest"
1689,THE DOG IN HOMER.,time known as the ‘dog of Orion.’ A brace of hounds typified to the
1690,THE DOG IN HOMER.,ardent imagination of the Vedic poets the inseparable association with
1691,THE DOG IN HOMER.,the sun of the morning and evening twilight. Æschylus elevates and
1692,THE DOG IN HOMER.,enlarges the idea of divine companionship in the eagle by calling it the
1693,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"‘winged dog of Zeus.’[51] Clytemnestra, in her hypocritical"
1694,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"protestations before the elders of Argos, could find no more striking"
1695,THE DOG IN HOMER.,image of fidelity than that of a house-dog left by its master to guard
1696,THE DOG IN HOMER.,his hearth and possessions.[52]

1706,THE DOG IN HOMER.,Two opposing currents of sentiment regarding the animal have thus from
1707,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the first set strongly in—one of repulsion verging towards abhorrence,"
1708,THE DOG IN HOMER.,the other of sympathy touched by the yearning pity which a superior
1709,THE DOG IN HOMER.,being cannot choose but feel towards an inferior laying at his feet the
1710,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"priceless gift of love. But since his higher qualities develop, as it"
1711,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"would seem, exclusively under the stimulation of human influence, it"
1712,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"might have been anticipated, and it is actually the case, that in those"
1713,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"countries where the dog is neglected, he is also despised, as by an"
1714,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"inevitable reaction it must follow that where he is despised, he will"
1715,THE DOG IN HOMER.,also be neglected. It is accordingly among peoples whose pursuits repel
1716,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"his co-operation that the sinister view prevails, while in hunting and"
1717,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"pastoral regions his credit grows as his faculties are cultivated, and"
1718,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"from the minister and delegate, he creeps by insensible gradations into"
1719,THE DOG IN HOMER.,the place of canine beatitude as the friend of man. The attitude of
1720,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"repulsion is, as is well known, general amongst Mahometan populations,"
1721,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"and may be described—although with notable exceptions, such as of the"
1722,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"ancient Egyptians and Assyrians, the modern Parsees and Japanese—as the"
1723,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Oriental position towards the species; while a benevolent sentiment is,"

1725,THE DOG IN HOMER.,
1726,THE DOG IN HOMER.,Now each of these opposite views is strongly and characteristically
1727,THE DOG IN HOMER.,represented in the Homeric poems; represented not as the mere reflection
1728,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"of a popular instinct, but with a certain ardour of personal feeling"
1729,THE DOG IN HOMER.,which now and again seems for a moment to draw back the veil of epic
1730,THE DOG IN HOMER.,impersonality from before the living face of the poet. To the bigoted
1731,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"believers in an indivisible Homer the fact is, no doubt, of most"
1732,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"perplexing import, and we leave them to account for it as best they may;"
1733,THE DOG IN HOMER.,but to impartial inquirers it affords at once a clue and an
1734,THE DOG IN HOMER.,illumination. For the Epic of Troy is not more sharply characterised by
1735,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"canine antipathy than the Song of Ulysses by canine sympathy; while, to"
1736,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"enhance the contrast, dislike to the dog is most remarkably associated"
1737,THE DOG IN HOMER.,with a vivid and untiring enthusiasm for the horse; and deep feeling for
1738,THE DOG IN HOMER.,the dog with comparative indifference to the equine race. More
1739,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"effectually than the most elaborate arguments of the Separatists, this"
1740,THE DOG IN HOMER.,innate disparity of sentiment appears to shiver the long contested unity
1741,THE DOG IN HOMER.,of Homeric authorship.
1742,THE DOG IN HOMER.,
1743,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"To descend, however, to particulars. Homeric dogs may be divided into"
1744,THE DOG IN HOMER.,four categories. (1) Dogs used in the chace; (2) shepherds’ dogs; (3)
1745,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"watch-dogs and house-dogs; (4) scavenger dogs. In the Iliad, the first"
1746,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"two classes occur incidentally only, either by way of illustration or in"
1747,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the course of some episodical narrative, such as that of the Calydonian"
1748,THE DOG IN HOMER.,boar-hunt in the Ninth Book. The plastic circumference of the Shield of
1749,THE DOG IN HOMER.,Achilles includes a cameo of dog-life; but it is noticeable that the
1750,THE DOG IN HOMER.,position there assigned to the animal is of a somewhat ignominious
1751,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"character, and is indicated with a perceptible touch of contempt. The"

1753,THE DOG IN HOMER.,
1754,THE DOG IN HOMER.,Of straight-horn’d cattle too a herd was grav’n;

1759,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Four golden shepherds walk’d beside the herd,"
1760,THE DOG IN HOMER.,By nine swift dogs attended; then amid
1761,THE DOG IN HOMER.,The foremost heifers sprang two lions fierce
1762,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Upon the lordly bull; he, bellowing loud,"
1763,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Was dragg’d along, by dogs and youths pursu’d."
1764,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"The tough bull’s hide they tore, and gorging lapp’d"

1779,THE DOG IN HOMER.,
1780,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"The direct Iliadic references to dogs, on the other hand, show clearly"
1781,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"that they were domesticated in Troy, that they lived in the tents of the"

1784,THE DOG IN HOMER.,other feathered rivals for the human remains left unburied on the field
1785,THE DOG IN HOMER.,of battle. The circumstance that in this revolting capacity they were
1786,THE DOG IN HOMER.,predominantly present to the mind of the poet unveils the secret of his
1787,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"profound aversion. Not as the humble and faithful minister of man,"
1788,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"hearkening to his voice, hanging on his looks, holding his life at a"

1810,THE DOG IN HOMER.,Is it credible that the same mind which was capable of conjuring up this
1811,THE DOG IN HOMER.,abhorrent vision should have conceived the pathetic picture of the
1812,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"faithful hound in the Odyssey? Nor can there be found, in the wide range"
1813,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"of the great Ilian epic, a single passage inconsistent in spirit with"
1814,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the lines cited above. Throughout its cantos, in which the usefulness of"
1815,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the animal is nevertheless amply recognised, and his peculiarities"
1816,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"sketched with graphic power and truthfulness, runs, like a dark thread,"
1817,THE DOG IN HOMER.,the remembrance of his hateful office as the inflictor of the last and
1818,THE DOG IN HOMER.,most atrocious insult upon ‘miserable humanity.’[55] One of the leading
1819,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"‘motives’ of the poem is, indeed, the fate of the body after death. The"
1820,THE DOG IN HOMER.,overmastering importance attached to its honourable interment forms the
1821,THE DOG IN HOMER.,hinge upon which a considerable portion of the action turns. The dread
1822,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"of its desecration continually haunts the imagination of the poet, and"
1823,THE DOG IN HOMER.,broods alike over the ramparts of Ilium and the tents of Greece. From
1824,THE DOG IN HOMER.,the first lines almost to the last the loathsome processes of canine
1825,THE DOG IN HOMER.,sepulture stand out as the direst result of defeat—the crowning terror
1826,THE DOG IN HOMER.,of death. Among the disastrous effects of the wrath of Achilles
1827,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"foreshadowed in the opening invocation, the visible and tangible horror"
1828,THE DOG IN HOMER.,is afforded by ‘devouring dogs and hungry vultures’ exercising their
1829,THE DOG IN HOMER.,revolting function on the corpses of the slain; before the dying eyes of
1830,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Hector rises, like a nightmare, the horrible anticipation of becoming"
1831,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the prey of ‘Achæan hounds,’[56] while his fierce adversary refuses to"
1832,THE DOG IN HOMER.,impair the gloomy perfection of his vengeance by remitting that supreme
1833,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"penalty;[57] next to the honours of his funeral-pyre, the chiefest"
1834,THE DOG IN HOMER.,consolation offered to the Shade of Patroclus is the promise to make the
1835,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"body of his slayer food for curs;[58] in her despair, Hecuba shrieks"
1836,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"that she brought forth her son to ‘glut swift-footed dogs,’[59] and bids"
1837,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Priam not seek to avert the abhorred doom. These instances, which it"
1838,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"would be easy to multiply, are unmodified by a solitary expression of"
1839,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"tenderness towards canine nature, or a single example of canine"
1840,THE DOG IN HOMER.,affection towards man.

1862,THE DOG IN HOMER.,It is true that a different view has been advocated by Sir William
1863,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Geddes, who, in his valuable work, ‘The Problem of the Homeric Poems,’"
1864,THE DOG IN HOMER.,first dwelt in detail on the contrasted treatment of the horse and dog
1865,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"in those early epics. He did not, however, stop there. A theory,"
1866,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"designed to solve the secular puzzle of Homeric authorship, had"
1867,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"presented itself to him, and demanded for its support a somewhat complex"
1868,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"marshalling of facts. His contention was briefly this:—that the Odyssey,"
1869,THE DOG IN HOMER.,with the ten books of the Iliad[60] amputated by Mr. Grote’s critical
1870,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"knife from the trunk of a supposed primitive Achilleid, are the work of"
1871,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"one and the same author, an Ionian of Asia Minor, to whom the venerable"
1872,THE DOG IN HOMER.,name of Homer properly belongs; while the fourteen books constituting
1873,THE DOG IN HOMER.,the nucleus and main substance of our Iliad are abandoned to an unknown
1874,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Thessalian bard. He has not, indeed, succeeded in engaging on his side"
1875,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the general opinion of the learned, yet it cannot be denied that his"
1876,THE DOG IN HOMER.,ingenious and patient analysis of the Homeric texts has served to
1877,THE DOG IN HOMER.,develop some highly suggestive minor points. The validity of his main
1878,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"argument obviously depends, in the first place, upon the discovery of"
1879,THE DOG IN HOMER.,striking correspondences between the Odyssey and the non-Achillean
1880,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"cantos of the Iliad; in the second, upon the exposure of irreconcilable"
1881,THE DOG IN HOMER.,discrepancies between the Odyssey and the Grotean Achilleid. But the
1882,THE DOG IN HOMER.,attempt is really hopeless to transplant the canine sympathy manifest in
1883,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the Odyssey to any part of the Iliad, or to localise in any particular"
1884,THE DOG IN HOMER.,section of the Iliad the equine sympathies displayed throughout the
1885,THE DOG IN HOMER.,many-coloured tissue of its composition.

1892,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Everywhere alike enthusiasm for the horse is evoked, vividly and"
1893,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"spontaneously, on all suitable occasions. Ardent admiration is uniformly"
1894,THE DOG IN HOMER.,bestowed upon his powers and faculties. He is nowhere passed by with
1895,THE DOG IN HOMER.,indifference. The verses glow with a kind of rapture of enjoyment that
1896,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"describe his strength and beauty, his eager spirit and fine nervous"
1897,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"organisation, his intelligent and disinterested participation in human"
1898,THE DOG IN HOMER.,struggles and triumphs. In the region of the Iliad claimed for the
1899,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Odyssean Homer, it suffices to point to the episode of the capture by"
1900,THE DOG IN HOMER.,Diomed and Sthenelus of the divinely-descended steeds of Æneas;[61] to
1901,THE DOG IN HOMER.,the careful provision of ambrosial forage for the horses of Heré along
1902,THE DOG IN HOMER.,the shores of Simoeis;[62] to the resplendent simile of Book vi.;[63] to
1903,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the gleeful zeal with which Odysseus and Diomed secure, as the fruit and"
1904,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"crown of their nocturnal expedition, the milk-white coursers of"
1905,THE DOG IN HOMER.,Rhesus;[64] to the living fervour imported into the chariot-race at the
1906,THE DOG IN HOMER.,funeral games of Patroclus; to the tender pathos with which Achilles
1907,THE DOG IN HOMER.,describes the grief of his immortal horses for their well-loved
1908,THE DOG IN HOMER.,charioteer.[65] The enumeration of similar examples from non-Achillean
1909,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"cantos might be carried much further, but where is the use of ‘breaking"
1910,THE DOG IN HOMER.,in an open door’? The evidence is overwhelming as to homogeneity of
1911,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"sentiment, in this important respect, through the entire Iliad. If more"
1912,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"than one author was concerned in its production, the coadjutors were at"
1913,THE DOG IN HOMER.,least unanimous in their glowing admiration for the heroic animal of
1914,THE DOG IN HOMER.,battle.

1974,THE DOG IN HOMER.,These sanguinary rites have been thought to afford proof that canine
1975,THE DOG IN HOMER.,companionship was necessary to the happiness of a Greek hero in the
1976,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"other world. For, amongst rude peoples, from the Scythians of"
1977,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Herodotus[68] to the Indians of Patagonia, such sacrifices have been a"
1978,THE DOG IN HOMER.,common mode of testifying respect to the dead. And it may readily be
1979,THE DOG IN HOMER.,admitted that their originally inspiring idea was that of continued
1980,THE DOG IN HOMER.,association after death with the objects most valued in life. But such
1981,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"an idea appears to have been very remotely, if at all, present to the"
1982,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"mind of our poet. The Ghost of Patroclus, at any rate, though"
1983,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"sufficiently communicative, expresses no desire for canine, equine,"
1984,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"bovine, or ovine society, although specimens of all four species were"

2000,THE DOG IN HOMER.,as multitudinous as the waves of passion which rolled over it. He
2001,THE DOG IN HOMER.,desired to appease the parted spirit of his friend with a sacrifice
2002,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"matching his own pride and the extent of his bereavement. Still more, he"
2003,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"sought to glut his vengeance, and allay, if possible, the intolerable"
2004,THE DOG IN HOMER.,pangs of his grief. He perhaps dimly imaged to himself a pompous funeral
2005,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"throng accompanying the beloved soul even to the gates of Hades,"
2006,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"provision for the way being supplied by the flesh of sheep and oxen, an"

2009,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"indignant human shades. A similar ceremony was put in practice, by"
2010,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"comparison recently, in Lithuania. When the still pagan Grand Duke"
2011,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Gedimin died in 1341, his body was laid on a pyre and burned with two"
2012,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"hounds, two falcons, his horse saddled and still living, and a favourite"
2013,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"servant.[70] But here the disembodied company was altogether friendly,"

2023,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"some degree to the stateliness of his surroundings. It is, however,"
2024,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"given casually, without a word of comment, as if the bard instinctively"
2025,THE DOG IN HOMER.,shrank from dwelling on the intimate personal relations of the animal to
2026,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"man. The son of Menœtius had a gentle soul, and we cannot doubt,"
2027,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"although no hint of such affection is communicated, that he loved his"
2028,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"dogs, and was loved by them. Of the horses accustomed to his"
2029,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"guidance—the immortal pair of Achilles—we indeed hear how they stood,"
2030,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"day after day, with drooping heads and silken manes sweeping the ground,"
2031,THE DOG IN HOMER.,in sorrow for his and their lost friend; but no dog is permitted to
2032,THE DOG IN HOMER.,whine his sense of bereavement beside the body of Patroclus; no dog
2033,THE DOG IN HOMER.,misses the vanished caress of his master’s hand; no dog crouches beside
2034,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Achilles in his solitude, or offers to his unsurpassed grief the dumb"
2035,THE DOG IN HOMER.,and wistful consolation of his sympathy. The privilege of sharing the
2036,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"sorrows, as of winning the applause of humanity, is, in the Iliad,"
2037,THE DOG IN HOMER.,reserved exclusively for the equine race.

2039,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Turning to the Odyssey, we find ourselves in a changed world. Ships have"
2040,THE DOG IN HOMER.,here become the ‘chariots of the sea’;[71] navigation usurps the honour
2041,THE DOG IN HOMER.,and interest of charioteering; a favourable breeze imparts the cheering
2042,THE DOG IN HOMER.,sense of companionship felt by a practised rider with his trusty steed.
2043,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"The scenery on shore leaves this sentiment undisturbed. Rocky Ithaca,"
2044,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Telemachus informs Menelaus,[72] contains neither wide tracks for"
2045,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"chariot-driving, nor deep meadows for horse-pasture; it is a"
2046,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"goat-feeding land, though more beautiful, to his mind, in its ruggedness"
2047,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"than even the ‘spacious plain’ of Sparta, with its rich fields of"
2048,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"lotus-grass, its sedgy flats, its waving tracts of ‘white barley,’"
2049,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"wheat, and spelt. A suitable habitat is thus, in his native island,"
2050,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"wanting for the horse, who is accordingly relegated to an obscure corner"
2051,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"of the stage, while the foreground of animal life is occupied by his"
2052,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"less imposing rival in the regard of man. The dog is, in fact, the"
2053,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"characteristic and conspicuous animal of the Odyssey, as the horse is of"
2054,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the Iliad. Xanthus and Balius, the wind-begotten steeds bestowed by"
2055,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Poseidon upon the sire of Achilles, who own the sorrowful human gift of"
2056,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"tears, and the superhuman gift of prophetic speech, are replaced[73] by"
2057,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the more homely, but not less pathetic, figure of Argus, the dog of"
2058,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Odysseus, whose fidelity through a score of years we feel to be no"
2059,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"poetical fiction, but simply a poetical enhancement of a familiar fact."
2060,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Canine society is, indeed, placed by the author of the Odyssey on a"
2061,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"higher level than it occupies, perhaps, in any other work of the"
2062,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"imagination. When Telemachus, starting into sudden manhood under the"
2063,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"tutelage of Athene, goes forth to lay his wrongs before the first"
2064,THE DOG IN HOMER.,Assembly convened in Ithaca since his father’s ‘hollow ships’ sailed for
2065,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Troy, we are told that he carried in his hand a brazen spear, and that"
2066,THE DOG IN HOMER.,the goddess poured out upon him a divine radiance of beauty such that
2067,THE DOG IN HOMER.,the people marvelled as they gazed on him. But the most singular and
2068,THE DOG IN HOMER.,significant part of the description lies in the statement (thrice
2069,THE DOG IN HOMER.,repeated on similar occasions[74]) that he went ‘not alone; two
2070,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"swift-footed dogs followed him.’ Alone indeed he was, as far as human"
2071,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"companionship was concerned—a helpless youth, isolated and indignant in"
2072,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the midst of a riotous and overbearing crew, intent not less upon"
2073,THE DOG IN HOMER.,wasting his substance than upon wooing his unwidowed mother. Comrade or
2074,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"attendant he had none, but instead of both, a pair of four-footed"
2075,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"sympathisers, evidently regarded as adding dignity to his appearance in"
2076,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"public, as well as imparting the strengthening consciousness of social"
2077,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"support. The conjunction, as Mr. Mahaffy well remarks, shows an intense"
2078,THE DOG IN HOMER.,appreciation of dog-nature.

2100,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"office of guarding and governing the 960 porkers composing his herd,"
2101,THE DOG IN HOMER.,Eumæus had the aid of four dogs reared by himself. They were large and
2102,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"fierce, ‘like wild beasts’;[75] but the savage instincts even of these"
2103,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"half-reclaimed creatures are discovered to be directed towards duty, to"
2104,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"be subdued by affection, nay, to be elevated by a touch of supersensual"
2105,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"awe. If they erred, it was by excess of zeal in the cause of law and"
2106,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"order. For when Odysseus (it must be remembered, in extremely"
2107,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"disreputable guise) approached the thorn-hedged enclosure, they set upon"
2108,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"him together, barking furiously, and threatening to tear him to pieces"
2109,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"on the spot. He had not, however, edged his way between Scylla and"
2110,THE DOG IN HOMER.,Charybdis to perish thus ingloriously. With unfailing presence of mind
2111,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"he instantly took up an attitude of non-resistance, stood still and laid"
2112,THE DOG IN HOMER.,aside his staff. This passivity doubtless produced some hesitation on
2113,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the part of his assailants, for when the swineherd hurried out to the"
2114,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"rescue, he was still unhurt. No small amount of compulsion, both moral"
2115,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"and physical—exerted by means of objurgatory remonstrance, coupled with"

2163,THE DOG IN HOMER.,
2164,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Thus as they spake, a dog that lay apart,"

2171,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"But now, his master gone, in foul neglect,"

2176,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"But when he saw Odysseus close approach,"
2177,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"He knew, and wagged his tail, and dropped his ears,"
2178,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Yet could not rise to fawn upon his lord,"
2179,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Who paused, and stood, and brushed aside a tear,"
2180,THE DOG IN HOMER.,Hiding his grief. Then thus with crafty speech:
2181,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"‘Eumæus, sure ‘tis wonder in such plight"
2182,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"To see this dog, of goodly form and limbs;"
2183,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"But tell me did his fleetness match his shape,"
2184,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Or was he such as, reared for pride and show,"
2185,THE DOG IN HOMER.,Inactive at their masters’ tables feed?’
2186,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Eumæus heard, and quickly made reply:"
2187,THE DOG IN HOMER.,‘To one who perished in a distant land
2188,THE DOG IN HOMER.,This dog belongs. But couldst thou see him now
2189,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"Such as Odysseus left him, bound for Troy,"

2191,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"‘Mid the deep thickets of the forest glades,"
2192,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"No game escaped his swift pursuing feet,"

2214,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"decrepitude, whose affectionate gestures form his only welcome to the"
2215,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"home now occupied by unscrupulous foes, ready to take his life at the"

2217,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"hand, or so much as a glance of his eye, to soothe the fatal spasm of"
2218,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"his joy. A case that might well draw a tear, even from the much-enduring"

2221,THE DOG IN HOMER.,It has not escaped the acumen of Sir William Geddes[79] that the
2222,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"compliment of an individual name is, in the Iliad, paid exclusively"
2223,THE DOG IN HOMER.,amongst the brute creation to horses; in the Odyssey (setting aside the
2224,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"mythical coursers of the Dawn, Book xxiii. 246) to a single dog. Now"
2225,THE DOG IN HOMER.,this may at first sight seem to be a trifling point; but a very little
2226,THE DOG IN HOMER.,consideration will suffice to show its significance. To the author of
2227,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the Odyssey, at least, the imposition, or even the disclosure of a name,"
2228,THE DOG IN HOMER.,was a matter clothed with a certain solemn importance. He lets us know

2230,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"the best of his ability, with an etymological interpretation of that"
2231,THE DOG IN HOMER.,ill-omened title.[80] How distinctively human a thing it is to have a

2234,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"fellow-citizens, and countrymen, ‘since no man, good or bad, is"
2235,THE DOG IN HOMER.,anonymous’![81] And the reply is couched in an earnest and exalted

2361,THE DOG IN HOMER.,individual. The varying _prominence_ assigned respectively to the horse
2362,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"and the dog might, it is true, be plausibly accounted for by the"
2363,THE DOG IN HOMER.,diversified conditions of the two epics; but no shifting of scene can
2364,THE DOG IN HOMER.,explain a _reversal_ of sympathies. Such sentiments form part of the
2365,THE DOG IN HOMER.,ingrained structure of the mind. They take root before consciousness is
2366,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"awake, or memory active; they live through the decades of a man’s life;"
2367,THE DOG IN HOMER.,are transported with him from shore to shore; survive the enthusiasm of
2368,THE DOG IN HOMER.,friendship and the illusions of ambition; they can no more be eradicated

2389,THE DOG IN HOMER.,‘powerful rhyme’ can sustain a reputation apart from its humble aid. But
2390,THE DOG IN HOMER.,the bard of Odysseus has long ceased to possess one. His only
2391,THE DOG IN HOMER.,appellation must remain for all time that of his hero in the Cyclops’
2392,THE DOG IN HOMER.,cave. The jealous Muses have blotted him out from memory. We can only be
2393,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"sure that he was a man who, like the protagonist of his immortal poem,"
2394,THE DOG IN HOMER.,"had known, and seen, and suffered many things, who had tears for the"

2438,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Solutré, near Mâcon, a veritable equine Golgotha has been excavated;"
2439,HOMERIC HORSES.,similar accumulations were found in the recesses of Monte Pellegrino in
2440,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Sicily; and Sir Richard Owen made the curious remark that, evidently"
2441,HOMERIC HORSES.,"through gastronomic selection, the osseous remains of colts and fillies"
2442,HOMERIC HORSES.,"vastly predominated, in the débris from the cave of Bruniquel, over"
2443,HOMERIC HORSES.,those of full-grown horses.[87]

2449,HOMERIC HORSES.,"The descent of our existing horses from the cave-animals is doubtful,"
2450,HOMERIC HORSES.,Eastern importations having at any rate greatly improved and modified
2451,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the breed. Wild horses, indeed, still at the end of the sixteenth"
2452,HOMERIC HORSES.,"century roamed the slopes of the Vosges, and were hunted as game in"
2453,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Poland and Lithuania;[88] but they may have been _muzins_, or runaways,"
2454,HOMERIC HORSES.,"like the mustangs on the American prairies. Nowadays, certainly, the"
2455,HOMERIC HORSES.,animal is found in a state of aboriginal freedom nowhere save on the
2456,HOMERIC HORSES.,"steppes of Central Asia, in the primitive home of the race. There, in"
2457,HOMERIC HORSES.,"all likelihood, the noblest of brute-forms was brought to perfection;"
2458,HOMERIC HORSES.,"there it was dominated by man; and thence equestrian arts, with their"
2459,HOMERIC HORSES.,"manifold results for civilisation, were propagated among the nations of"
2460,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the world. They were taught to the Egyptians, it would seem, by their"
2461,HOMERIC HORSES.,"shepherd conquerors, but were not learned by the Arabs until a couple of"
2462,HOMERIC HORSES.,"millenniums later, the Arab contingent in Xerxes’ army having been a"
2463,HOMERIC HORSES.,"‘camel-corps.’ The Persians, indeed, early picked up the habit of riding"
2464,HOMERIC HORSES.,from the example of their Tartar neighbours; yet that it was no original
2465,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Aryan accomplishment, the absence of a common Aryan word to express the"
2466,HOMERIC HORSES.,idea sufficiently shows. The relations of our primitive ancestors with
2467,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the animal had, at the most, reached what might be called the second, or"
2468,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Scythian stage, when droves of half-wild horses took the place of"
2469,HOMERIC HORSES.,"cattle, and mares’ milk was an important article of food. The aboriginal"
2470,HOMERIC HORSES.,"cavalry of the desert belonged, on the other hand, to the wide kinship"
2471,HOMERIC HORSES.,"of Attila’s Huns, who, separated from their steeds, were as helpless as"
2472,HOMERIC HORSES.,"swans on shore. The war-chariot, however, was an Assyrian invention,"
2473,HOMERIC HORSES.,dating back at least to the seventeenth century B.C. It quickly reached
2474,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Egypt on one side, India on the other, and was adopted, some time before"
2475,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the Dorian invasion, by the Achæans of the Peloponnesus. Mycenæan"
2476,HOMERIC HORSES.,grave-stones of about the twelfth century are engraven with battle and
2477,HOMERIC HORSES.,"hunting scenes, the actors in which are borne along in vehicles of"
2478,HOMERIC HORSES.,essentially the same construction with those brought before us in the
2479,HOMERIC HORSES.,Iliad. They show scarcely any variation from the simple model developed
2480,HOMERIC HORSES.,on the banks of the Tigris; yet there was no direct imitation. Homer was
2481,HOMERIC HORSES.,profoundly unconscious of Ninevite splendours. He had no inkling of the
2482,HOMERIC HORSES.,"existence of a great Mesopotamian monarchy far away to the East, beyond"
2483,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the rising-places of the sun, where one branch of his dichotomised"
2484,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Ethiopians dwelt in peace. Nevertheless, the life that he knew, and that"
2485,HOMERIC HORSES.,"was glorified by him, was touched with many influences from this unknown"
2486,HOMERIC HORSES.,"land. If some of them filtered through Egypt on their way, acquaintance"
2487,HOMERIC HORSES.,with the art of charioteering certainly took a less circuitous route.
2488,HOMERIC HORSES.,For the third horse of the original Assyrian team was never introduced
2489,HOMERIC HORSES.,"into Egypt, and was early discarded in Assyria itself. He figures"
2490,HOMERIC HORSES.,"continually, however, in Homeric engagements, running, loosely attached,"
2491,HOMERIC HORSES.,"beside the regularly yoked pair, one of whom he was destined to replace"
2492,HOMERIC HORSES.,"in case of emergency. The presence, then, of this ‘silly,’ or roped"
2493,HOMERIC HORSES.,"horse,[89] παρήορος ἵππος, demonstrates both the high antiquity, and the"
2494,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Anatolian negotiation, of the loan which included him."

2502,HOMERIC HORSES.,The word ‘silly’ thus applied is evidently cognate with the German
2503,HOMERIC HORSES.,"_Seile_ = Greek σειρὰ, a rope, from the root _swar_, to tie. So in the"
2504,HOMERIC HORSES.,"_Ancient Mariner_, the ‘_silly_ buckets on the deck’ are the buckets"
2505,HOMERIC HORSES.,"attached to a rope. Similarly, the third horse was sometimes called by"
2506,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the Greeks σειραφόρος, ‘drawing by a rope.’"
2507,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2508,HOMERIC HORSES.,The fertile plains of Babylonia probably furnished the equine supplies
2509,HOMERIC HORSES.,of Egypt and Asia Minor during some centuries before the Nisæan
2510,HOMERIC HORSES.,"stock,[90] cultivated in Media, acquired its Hellenic reputation. So far"
2511,HOMERIC HORSES.,"as can be judged from ancient vase-paintings, the horses of Achilles and"
2512,HOMERIC HORSES.,Hector were of pure Oriental type. They owned the same points of
2513,HOMERIC HORSES.,"breeding—the small heads, slender yet muscular legs, and high-arching"
2514,HOMERIC HORSES.,"necks, the same eager eye and proud bearing, characterising the steeds"
2515,HOMERIC HORSES.,that shared the triumphs of Asurbanipal and Shalmaneser. The same
2516,HOMERIC HORSES.,"quasi-heroic position, too, belonged to the horse in the camp before"
2517,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Troy and at Nineveh. He shared, in both scenes of action, only the"
2518,HOMERIC HORSES.,"nobler pursuits of man, and was exempt from the drudgery of servile"
2519,HOMERIC HORSES.,"work. The beasts of burden, alike of the Iliad and of the sculptures of"
2520,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Khorsabad and Kouyunjik, were mules and oxen, not horses. Equine"
2521,HOMERIC HORSES.,"co-operation was reserved for war and the chace—for war alone, indeed,"
2522,HOMERIC HORSES.,"by the Homeric Greeks, who appear always to have hunted on foot. This"
2523,HOMERIC HORSES.,"was inevitable. Modes of conveyance, were they drawn by Sleipnir or"
2524,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Areion, would have been an encumbrance in pursuing game through the"
2525,HOMERIC HORSES.,"thickets of Parnassus, or over the broken skirts of Mount Ida."

2532,HOMERIC HORSES.,"possession was a mark of distinction, and conferred the power of swift"
2533,HOMERIC HORSES.,"locomotion, but was otherwise of no military use. Their owners alighted"
2534,HOMERIC HORSES.,"from them for the serious business of fighting, although glad, if"
2535,HOMERIC HORSES.,"worsted or disabled, to fall back upon the utmost speed of their horses"
2536,HOMERIC HORSES.,"to carry them out of reach of their foes. This fashion of warfare,"
2537,HOMERIC HORSES.,"however, had completely disappeared from Greece proper before the"
2538,HOMERIC HORSES.,"historic era. Only in Cyprus, chariots are heard of among the"
2539,HOMERIC HORSES.,paraphernalia of battle in 498 B.C.[91] None figured at Marathon or
2540,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Mantineia; brigades of mounted men had taken their place. Cavalry, on"

2547,HOMERIC HORSES.,The definiteness of intention with which Homeric epithets were bestowed
2548,HOMERIC HORSES.,is strikingly evident in the distribution of those relating to
2549,HOMERIC HORSES.,equestrian pursuits. That they have no place worth mentioning in the
2550,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Odyssey, readers of our last chapter will be prepared to hear; nor are"
2551,HOMERIC HORSES.,"they sprinkled at random through the Iliad. Thus, while the Trojans"
2552,HOMERIC HORSES.,"collectively are frequently called ‘horse-tamers,’ _hippodamoi_—a"
2553,HOMERIC HORSES.,designation still appropriate to the dwellers round Hissarlik—the Greeks
2554,HOMERIC HORSES.,"collectively are never so described.[92] They could not have been, in"
2555,HOMERIC HORSES.,"fact, without some degree of incongruity. For many of them, being of"
2556,HOMERIC HORSES.,"insular origin and maritime habits, knew as much about hippogriffs as"
2557,HOMERIC HORSES.,"about horses, unless it were the white-crested ones ruled by Poseidon."
2558,HOMERIC HORSES.,And the poet’s close instinctive regard to such distinctions appears in
2559,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the remarkable circumstance that Odysseus and Ajax Telamon, islanders"
2560,HOMERIC HORSES.,"both, are the only heroes of the first rank who invariably combat on"
2561,HOMERIC HORSES.,foot.

2567,HOMERIC HORSES.,The individual Greek warriors singled out for praise as ‘horse-tamers’
2568,HOMERIC HORSES.,"are only two—Thrasymedes and Diomed. The choice had, in each case,"
2569,HOMERIC HORSES.,readily discernible motives. Thrasymedes was a son of Nestor; and
2570,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Nestor, through his father Peleus, was sprung from Poseidon, the creator"
2571,HOMERIC HORSES.,and patron of the horse. This mythical association resulted from a
2572,HOMERIC HORSES.,natural sequence of ideas. The absence of the horse from the ‘glist’ring
2573,HOMERIC HORSES.,zodiac’ is one of many proofs of his strangeness to Eastern mythology;
2574,HOMERIC HORSES.,but the neglect was compensated in the West. His position in Greek
2575,HOMERIC HORSES.,"folk-lore, according to Dr. Milchhöfer,[93] indicates a primitive"
2576,HOMERIC HORSES.,"confusion of thought between winds and waves as cause and effect, or"
2577,HOMERIC HORSES.,"rather, perhaps, tells of the transference to the sea of the"
2578,HOMERIC HORSES.,"cloud-fancies of an inland people. However this be, horse-headed"
2579,HOMERIC HORSES.,monsters are extremely prevalent on the archaic engraved stones found
2580,HOMERIC HORSES.,numerously in the Peloponnesus and the islands of the Ægean; and these
2581,HOMERIC HORSES.,"monsters—winged, and with birds’ legs—represent, it would seem, the"
2582,HOMERIC HORSES.,original harpy-form in which early Greek imagination embodied the
2583,HOMERIC HORSES.,storm-winds—

2593,HOMERIC HORSES.,"The horse-headed Demeter, too, was one of the Erinyes, under-world"

2595,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Homeric Harpy Podarge, mother of the immortal steeds of Achilles, was,"
2596,HOMERIC HORSES.,"moreover, of scarcely disguised equine nature; while the colts of"

2610,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2611,HOMERIC HORSES.,The figure of speech by which the swiftest of known animals was likened
2612,HOMERIC HORSES.,"to a rushing tempest, lay ready at hand; and a figure of speech is apt"
2613,HOMERIC HORSES.,to be treated as a statement of fact by men who have not yet learned to
2614,HOMERIC HORSES.,"make fine distinctions. Upon this particular one as a basis, a good deal"
2615,HOMERIC HORSES.,"of fable was built. The northern legends, for instance, of the Wild"
2616,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Huntsman, and of the rides of the blusterous Odin upon an eight-legged"
2617,HOMERIC HORSES.,charger equally at home on land and on sea; besides the story of the
2618,HOMERIC HORSES.,"strong horse Svadilfaxi, personifying the North Wind, who helped his"
2619,HOMERIC HORSES.,"master, the icy Scandinavian winter, to build the castle of the Asar."
2620,HOMERIC HORSES.,"The same obvious similitude was carried out, by southern imaginations,"
2621,HOMERIC HORSES.,in the subjection of the horse to the established ruler of winds and
2622,HOMERIC HORSES.,"waves, who is even qualified by the characteristically equine epithet"
2623,HOMERIC HORSES.,"‘dark-maned’ (κυανοχαίτης.)[95] The attribution, however, to Poseidon of"
2624,HOMERIC HORSES.,a more or less equine nature may have been immediately suggested by the
2625,HOMERIC HORSES.,"resemblance, palpable to unsophisticated folk, of his crested billows to"
2626,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the impetuous advance of galloping steeds, whose flowing manes and"
2627,HOMERIC HORSES.,curving lineaments of changeful movement seemed to reproduce the tossing
2628,HOMERIC HORSES.,spray and thunderous charge of the ‘earth-shaking’ element.

2633,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2634,HOMERIC HORSES.,"In the Thirteenth Iliad, the closeness of this relationship is naïvely"
2635,HOMERIC HORSES.,brought into view. The occasion was a pressing one. Nothing less was
2636,HOMERIC HORSES.,contemplated than the affording of surreptitious divine aid to the
2637,HOMERIC HORSES.,"hard-pressed Achæan host; and the ‘shining eyes’ of Zeus, whose"
2638,HOMERIC HORSES.,"interdict was still in full force, might at any moment revert from the"
2639,HOMERIC HORSES.,Thracians and Hippomolgi to the less virtuous Greeks and Trojans.
2640,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Everything, then, depended upon promptitude, and Poseidon accordingly,"
2641,HOMERIC HORSES.,"in the absence of his consort Amphitrite, did not disdain to act as his"
2642,HOMERIC HORSES.,own groom. Himself he harnessed to his brazen car the ‘bronze-hoofed’
2643,HOMERIC HORSES.,coursers stabled beneath the sea at Ægæ; himself wielded the golden
2644,HOMERIC HORSES.,"scourge with which he urged their rapid passage, amid the damp homage of"
2645,HOMERIC HORSES.,"dutiful but dripping sea-monsters, to a submarine recess between Tenedos"
2646,HOMERIC HORSES.,and Imbros:
2647,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2648,HOMERIC HORSES.,"And the sea’s face was parted with a smile,"
2649,HOMERIC HORSES.,And rapidly the horses sped the while.[96]
2650,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2651,HOMERIC HORSES.,There he himself provided ambrosial forage for their support during his
2652,HOMERIC HORSES.,"absence on the battle-field, taking the precaution, before his"
2653,HOMERIC HORSES.,"departure, of attaching infrangible golden shackles to the agile feet"
2654,HOMERIC HORSES.,that might else have been tempted to stray. Yet all this pains was taken
2655,HOMERIC HORSES.,"for the mere sake of what must be called ‘swagger.’ Poseidon, calmly"
2656,HOMERIC HORSES.,"seated on the Samothracian height, was already within full view of the"
2657,HOMERIC HORSES.,"plain and towers of Ilium, when"
2658,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2659,HOMERIC HORSES.,Sudden at last
2660,HOMERIC HORSES.,"He rose, and swiftly down the steep he passed,"
2661,HOMERIC HORSES.,"The mountain trembled with each step he took,"
2662,HOMERIC HORSES.,The forest with the quaking mountain shook.
2663,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Three strides he made, and with the fourth he stood"

2665,HOMERIC HORSES.,His hall of glorious gold that cannot fade.[97]
2666,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2667,HOMERIC HORSES.,And the journey westward was deliberately made for the purpose of
2668,HOMERIC HORSES.,fetching an equipage which proved rather an embarrassment than an
2669,HOMERIC HORSES.,"assistance to him. ‘But for the honour of the thing,’ as an Irishman"

2683,HOMERIC HORSES.,Poseidonian lineage. Nestor himself was an enthusiastic horse-lover; yet
2684,HOMERIC HORSES.,the Pylian breed was none of the best; and he anxiously warned his son
2685,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Antilochus, preparatory to the starting of the chariot-race"
2686,HOMERIC HORSES.,"commemorative of Patroclus, that he must supply by finesse for the"
2687,HOMERIC HORSES.,"slowness of his team. Poseidon himself, he reminded him, had been his"
2688,HOMERIC HORSES.,"instructor; and no less, it may be presumed, of his brother Thrasymedes,"
2689,HOMERIC HORSES.,"whose feats in this direction, however, are summed up in the laudatory"
2690,HOMERIC HORSES.,expression bestowed on him in common with Diomed.
2691,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2692,HOMERIC HORSES.,"The connoisseurship of this latter, on the contrary, is perpetually in"
2693,HOMERIC HORSES.,"evidence. As king of ‘horse-feeding Argos,’ he knew and prized what was"
2694,HOMERIC HORSES.,"best in horseflesh, and counted no risk too great for the purpose of"
2695,HOMERIC HORSES.,"securing it. His brilliant success accordingly, in the capture of famous"
2696,HOMERIC HORSES.,"steeds, rendered the original inferiority of his own a matter of"
2697,HOMERIC HORSES.,"indifference. It served, indeed, only to quicken his zeal to replace"
2698,HOMERIC HORSES.,them by force or fraud with better. And it fell out most opportunely
2699,HOMERIC HORSES.,"that, just at the conjuncture when the protection of Athene rendered him"
2700,HOMERIC HORSES.,"irresistible, Æneas, temporarily allied with the Lycian archer Pandarus,"
2701,HOMERIC HORSES.,undertook the hopeless task of staying his victorious career. The
2702,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Dardanian hero was driving a matchless team, ‘the best under the dawn or"
2703,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the sun’; and he found leisure, notwithstanding the celerity of their"
2704,HOMERIC HORSES.,"onset, to extol their qualities to his companion, while Diomed recited"
2705,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the to him familiar tale of their pedigree to his charioteer, Sthenelus."
2706,HOMERIC HORSES.,They were of the race of those with which the ransom of Ganymede had
2707,HOMERIC HORSES.,"been paid by Zeus to Tros, King of Phrygia, his father, and were hence"
2708,HOMERIC HORSES.,known distinctively as _Trojan_ horses. Their possession was regarded as
2709,HOMERIC HORSES.,of inestimable importance.
2710,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2711,HOMERIC HORSES.,"That was the day of glory of the son of Tydeus, whom ‘Pallas Athene did"
2712,HOMERIC HORSES.,not permit to tremble.’ Destiny waited on his desires. His spear sent
2713,HOMERIC HORSES.,Pandarus to the shades; Æneas was barely rescued by the maternal
2714,HOMERIC HORSES.,"intervention of Aphrodite, who came off by no means scatheless from the"
2715,HOMERIC HORSES.,"adventure. Above all, the Dardanian ‘messengers of terror’ were led in"
2716,HOMERIC HORSES.,triumph across to the Achæan camp. They did not remain there idle. On
2717,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the following day, Nestor was invited to admire their paces, as they"
2718,HOMERIC HORSES.,"carried him and their new master beyond the reach of Hector’s fury, the"
2719,HOMERIC HORSES.,fortune of war having by that time effectively changed sides. Their
2720,HOMERIC HORSES.,subsequent victory in the Patroclean chariot-race was a foregone
2721,HOMERIC HORSES.,conclusion. For their Olympian connexions would have made their defeat
2722,HOMERIC HORSES.,by clover-cropping animals of ordinary lineage appear a gross anomaly;
2723,HOMERIC HORSES.,"and the horses of Achilles, as being immortal and invincible, were"
2724,HOMERIC HORSES.,expressly excluded from the competition.
2725,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2726,HOMERIC HORSES.,"The night-adventure of Diomed and Odysseus, narrated in the Tenth Iliad,"
2727,HOMERIC HORSES.,is unmistakably an after-thought and interlude. To what precedes it is
2728,HOMERIC HORSES.,in part irrelevant; with what follows it is wholly unconnected; nor is
2729,HOMERIC HORSES.,"it logically complete in itself. The interpolation is, none the less, of"
2730,HOMERIC HORSES.,"respectable antiquity, going back certainly to the eighth century B.C.;"
2731,HOMERIC HORSES.,"it has high merits of its own, and could ill be spared from the body of"
2732,HOMERIC HORSES.,"what it is convenient to call Homeric poetry. Its admission, to be sure,"
2733,HOMERIC HORSES.,"crowds into one night performances enough to occupy several, but this"
2734,HOMERIC HORSES.,superfluity of business scarcely troubles any genially disposed reader;
2735,HOMERIC HORSES.,nor need he grudge Odysseus the three suppers—one of them perhaps better
2736,HOMERIC HORSES.,described as a breakfast—amply earned by his indefatigable services in
2737,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the epic cause, and counterbalanced by many subsequent privations. The"
2738,HOMERIC HORSES.,"point, however, to be specially noted by us here, is that in the"
2739,HOMERIC HORSES.,"‘Doloneia’—as the tenth book is designated—equestrian interests, its"
2740,HOMERIC HORSES.,"extraneous origin notwithstanding, are paramount."

2742,HOMERIC HORSES.,The opening situation is that magnificently described at the close of
2743,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the eighth book, when the ‘dark-ribbed ships’ by the Hellespont seemed"
2744,HOMERIC HORSES.,to cower before the menacing camp-fires of the victorious Trojans.
2745,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Indeed, most of those who lay in their shadow would gladly have grasped,"
2746,HOMERIC HORSES.,"before it was too late, at the means of escape they offered. Agamemnon’s"
2747,HOMERIC HORSES.,"fluctuating mind, too, might easily have been brought to that inglorious"
2748,HOMERIC HORSES.,"decision; but for the moment, he relieved his restless anxiety by"
2749,HOMERIC HORSES.,hastily summoning to a nocturnal council a few of the most prominent
2750,HOMERIC HORSES.,Achæan chiefs. The somewhat inadequate result of their deliberations was
2751,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the despatch of a scouting party to the Trojan quarters, Diomed and"
2752,HOMERIC HORSES.,Odysseus being inevitably chosen for the discharge of the perilous
2753,HOMERIC HORSES.,"office—inevitably, since in the legend of Troy, these two are again and"
2754,HOMERIC HORSES.,"again coupled in the performance of venturesome, if not questionable,"
2755,HOMERIC HORSES.,exploits.[98] They had sallied forth unarmed on the sudden summons of
2756,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the ‘king of men,’ but collected from the sympathetic bystanders a"
2757,HOMERIC HORSES.,scratch-lot of weapons; and Meriones lent to Odysseus for the emergency
2758,HOMERIC HORSES.,"a peculiar head-piece of leather lined with felt, and strengthened with"
2759,HOMERIC HORSES.,"rows of boars’ teeth,[99] the like of which, judging from the profusion"
2760,HOMERIC HORSES.,"of sliced tusks met with in Mycenæan graves, was probably familiar of"
2761,HOMERIC HORSES.,old in the Peloponnesus.

2771,HOMERIC HORSES.,It was pitch dark as the adventurers traversed the marshy land about the
2772,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Simoeis; but the rise, with heavy wing-flappings, of a startled heron on"
2773,HOMERIC HORSES.,"their right, dispelled their misgivings, and evoked their pious"
2774,HOMERIC HORSES.,rejoicings at the assurance it afforded of Athene’s protection. Their
2775,HOMERIC HORSES.,"next encounter was with Hector’s emissary, the luckless Dolon, a poor"
2776,HOMERIC HORSES.,"creature beyond doubt, vain, feather-headed, unstable, pusillanimous,"
2777,HOMERIC HORSES.,yet piteous to us even now in the sanguine loquacity that merged into a
2778,HOMERIC HORSES.,death-shriek as the fierce blade of Diomed severed the tendons of his
2779,HOMERIC HORSES.,"throat. He had served his purpose, and was contemptuously, nay"
2780,HOMERIC HORSES.,"treacherously, dismissed from life. But the temptation suggested by him"
2781,HOMERIC HORSES.,"was irresistible. Instincts of cupidity, keen in both heroes, had been"
2782,HOMERIC HORSES.,fully roused by his account of the splendid and unguarded equipment of
2783,HOMERIC HORSES.,the newly-arrived leader of a Thracian contingent to the Trojan army. As
2784,HOMERIC HORSES.,he told them:
2785,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2786,HOMERIC HORSES.,"King Rhesus, Eionëus’ son, commands them, who hath steeds,"
2787,HOMERIC HORSES.,"More white than snow, huge, and well shaped; their fiery pace exceeds"
2788,HOMERIC HORSES.,"The winds in swiftness; these I saw, his chariot is with gold"
2789,HOMERIC HORSES.,"And pallid silver richly framed, and wondrous to behold;"

2796,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2797,HOMERIC HORSES.,Now Odysseus and Diomed both loved plunder; each in his own way was of a
2798,HOMERIC HORSES.,reckless and dare-devil disposition; and one at any rate was a
2799,HOMERIC HORSES.,passionate admirer of equine beauty. They accordingly did not hesitate
2800,HOMERIC HORSES.,"to follow up Dolon’s indications, which proved quite accurate. The"
2801,HOMERIC HORSES.,followers of Rhesus were weary from their recent journey; Diomed had no
2802,HOMERIC HORSES.,"difficulty in slaying a dozen of them in ranks as they slept, and so"
2803,HOMERIC HORSES.,"reaching the king, whose premonitory nightmare of destruction was"
2804,HOMERIC HORSES.,abruptly dissolved by its realisation. The coveted horses tethered
2805,HOMERIC HORSES.,"alongside having been meanwhile secured by Odysseus, swiftly conveyed"
2806,HOMERIC HORSES.,the exultant raiders back to the Achæan ships.
2807,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2808,HOMERIC HORSES.,But in what manner? On their backs or drawn behind them in the
2809,HOMERIC HORSES.,glittering Thracian chariot? Opinions are divided. Euripides assumed
2810,HOMERIC HORSES.,"that the latter formed part of the booty,[101] yet the Homeric"
2811,HOMERIC HORSES.,"expressions rather imply that it was left _in statu quo_. They are not,"
2812,HOMERIC HORSES.,"on the other hand, easily reconciled with the supposition of an escape"
2813,HOMERIC HORSES.,"on horseback from the scene of carnage. This, none the less, was almost"
2814,HOMERIC HORSES.,"certainly what the poet meant to convey, and his unfamiliarity with the"
2815,HOMERIC HORSES.,art of riding was doubtless the cause of his conveying it badly.[102]
2816,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Homeric heroes, as a rule infringed only by this one exception, never"
2817,HOMERIC HORSES.,mounted their steeds; they used them solely in light draught. Equitation
2818,HOMERIC HORSES.,was indeed known of as a branch in which special skill might be
2819,HOMERIC HORSES.,"acquired; but for the ignoble purpose of popular, perhaps venal,"
2820,HOMERIC HORSES.,display. Thus the performance of leaping from one to the other of four
2821,HOMERIC HORSES.,"galloping horses, brought in to illustrate the agility with which Ajax"
2822,HOMERIC HORSES.,"strode from deck to deck of the menaced Thessalian ships,[103] excites"
2823,HOMERIC HORSES.,"indeed astonishment, but astonishment of the inferior kind raised by the"
2824,HOMERIC HORSES.,feats of a clown or a circus-rider. The passage has found a curious
2825,HOMERIC HORSES.,commentary in a faded painting on a wall of the ancient palace at
2826,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Tiryns, representing an acrobat springing on the back of a rushing"
2827,HOMERIC HORSES.,bull.[104] He is unmistakably a specimen of the class of performer to
2828,HOMERIC HORSES.,which the nimble equestrian of the Iliad belonged.

2847,HOMERIC HORSES.,"The animated story of the Doloneia, however, originated most likely in a"
2848,HOMERIC HORSES.,"primitive nature-parable, symbolising, in one of its innumerable forms,"
2849,HOMERIC HORSES.,the ever-renewed struggle of darkness with light. The prize carried off
2850,HOMERIC HORSES.,"by Diomed and Odysseus was, this being so, nothing less than the"
2851,HOMERIC HORSES.,"equipage of the sun; yet the solar horses are, mythologically, scarcely"
2852,HOMERIC HORSES.,"separable from the vehicle attached to them. Our bard, it is true, being"
2853,HOMERIC HORSES.,"wholly intent upon the concrete aspect of the tale he had to tell, felt"
2854,HOMERIC HORSES.,no incongruity in the disjunction; and he certainly took no pains to
2855,HOMERIC HORSES.,"perpetuate the traditional shape of his materials. Unconsciously,"
2856,HOMERIC HORSES.,"however, he has allowed some vestiges of solar relationships to survive"
2857,HOMERIC HORSES.,among the less fortunate actors in his little drama. They can be traced
2858,HOMERIC HORSES.,"in the wrath of Apollo at the exploit achieved, while he was off his"
2859,HOMERIC HORSES.,"guard, through the assistance of the predatory Athene;[105] and perhaps"
2860,HOMERIC HORSES.,"in the costume of Dolon, who clothed himself, we are told, for his"
2861,HOMERIC HORSES.,disastrous expedition in ‘the skin of a grey wolf.’ Now the wolf became
2862,HOMERIC HORSES.,"early entangled, in Aryan folk-lore, with luminous associations. At"
2863,HOMERIC HORSES.,"first, possibly through contrast and antagonism, exemplified in the"
2864,HOMERIC HORSES.,"hostile pursuit, by the Scandinavian animal, of the sun and moon; later,"
2865,HOMERIC HORSES.,through capricious identification. The lupine connexions of the Hellenic
2866,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Apollo may be thus explained. They were, at any rate, strongly"
2867,HOMERIC HORSES.,"accentuated; and Dolon wore, in some sense, albeit ignobly, ‘the livery"
2868,HOMERIC HORSES.,of the burnished sun.’

2875,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Manifestly solar, on the other hand, are the snowy horses from across"
2876,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the Hellespont. Nestor, who, characteristically enough, first caught the"
2877,HOMERIC HORSES.,"sound of their galloping approach to the Greek outposts, demanded of"
2878,HOMERIC HORSES.,their captors in amazement:
2879,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2880,HOMERIC HORSES.,How have you made this horse your prize? Pierced you the dangerous
2881,HOMERIC HORSES.,"host,"
2882,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Where such gems stand? Or did some god your high attempts accost,"

2890,HOMERIC HORSES.,"The Thracian pair, moreover, are the only _white_ horses mentioned in"

2892,HOMERIC HORSES.,"from Æneas by Diomed, was sorrel, with a white crescent on the"
2893,HOMERIC HORSES.,"forehead;[107] Achilles, or Patroclus for him, drove a chestnut and a"
2894,HOMERIC HORSES.,piebald; a pair of rufous bays drew the chariot of Asius. No black horse
2895,HOMERIC HORSES.,"appears on the scene; nor can we be sure that the ‘dark-maned,’ mythical"
2896,HOMERIC HORSES.,Areion was really understood to be of sable tint. Admiration for white
2897,HOMERIC HORSES.,horses was not spontaneous among the Greeks. It sprang up in the East as
2898,HOMERIC HORSES.,a consequence of their figurative association with the sun. The Iranian
2899,HOMERIC HORSES.,"fable of the solar chariot drawn by spotless coursers, carried"
2900,HOMERIC HORSES.,"everywhere with it, in its diffusion west, south, and north, an"
2901,HOMERIC HORSES.,imaginative impression of the sacredness of such animals.[108] They were
2902,HOMERIC HORSES.,chosen out for the Magian sacrifices;[109] they were tended in
2903,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Scandinavian temple-enclosures, and their neighings oracularly"
2904,HOMERIC HORSES.,interpreted;[110] a white horse was dubiously reported by Strabo to be
2905,HOMERIC HORSES.,periodically immolated by the Veneti in commemoration of Diomed’s
2906,HOMERIC HORSES.,fabulous sovereignty over the Adriatic;[111] and it became a recognised

2911,HOMERIC HORSES.,the sanctity of the Jewish Temple; Odin thundered over the mountain-tops
2912,HOMERIC HORSES.,on a pallid courser; and it was deemed scandalous presumption in
2913,HOMERIC HORSES.,Camillus to have his triumphal chariot drawn to the Capitol after the

2940,HOMERIC HORSES.,Their quondam master could lay claim to scarcely a more solid core of

2952,HOMERIC HORSES.,systematically regulated and consistently maintained. There is nothing
2953,HOMERIC HORSES.,"casual about them. Thus, Paris’s lack of a conveyance serves to"
2954,HOMERIC HORSES.,emphasise his inferiority in the field. He was a craven at close
2955,HOMERIC HORSES.,"quarters, though formidable as a bow-man, despatching his arrows from"
2956,HOMERIC HORSES.,the safe shelter of the ranks. For the adventurous sallies rendered
2957,HOMERIC HORSES.,"possible only by the aid of fleet steeds, he had neither taste nor"
2958,HOMERIC HORSES.,aptitude.
2959,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2960,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Hector, on the contrary, was distinguished above all other Homeric"
2961,HOMERIC HORSES.,warriors by driving four horses abreast—above all Homeric gods and
2962,HOMERIC HORSES.,"goddesses even, since Poseidon himself, Ares, Heré, and Eos, were"
2963,HOMERIC HORSES.,"content each with a pair. In their case, however, the seeming deficiency"
2964,HOMERIC HORSES.,was a point of real superiority. For no more than two horses can have
2965,HOMERIC HORSES.,"been in effective employment in drawing Hector’s chariot, the remaining"
2966,HOMERIC HORSES.,two being held in reserve against accidents. But Olympian coursers were
2967,HOMERIC HORSES.,"presumably exempt from mortal casualties, and there was hence no need to"
2968,HOMERIC HORSES.,"provide for the emergency of their disablement. Critics, nevertheless,"
2969,HOMERIC HORSES.,"of the ultra-strict school, taking offence at the unexpected"
2970,HOMERIC HORSES.,"introduction of a four-in-hand, have proclaimed the entire enshrining"
2971,HOMERIC HORSES.,passage spurious. Perhaps on insufficient grounds; yet as to this there
2972,HOMERIC HORSES.,may be two opinions; there can be only one as to its being stirring and
2973,HOMERIC HORSES.,splendid.
2974,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2975,HOMERIC HORSES.,The formal introduction of the only horses on the Trojan side dignified
2976,HOMERIC HORSES.,"with proper names, makes an impressive exordium to the lay of Trojan"
2977,HOMERIC HORSES.,victory after Diomed’s audacious resistance had been turned to flight by
2978,HOMERIC HORSES.,the thunder-bolt of Zeus. Hector’s fiery incitements were addressed no
2979,HOMERIC HORSES.,less earnestly to his equine servants than to his Lycian and Dardanian
2980,HOMERIC HORSES.,allies.
2981,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2982,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Then cherished he his famous horse: O Xanthus now, said he,"
2983,HOMERIC HORSES.,"And thou Podargus, Æthon, too, and Lampus, dear to me,"
2984,HOMERIC HORSES.,Make me some worthy recompense for so much choice of meat
2985,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Given you by fair Andromache; bread of the purest wheat,"
2986,HOMERIC HORSES.,"And with it for your drink mixed wine, to make ye wished cheer,"
2987,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Still serving you before myself, her husband young and dear.[113]"
2988,HOMERIC HORSES.,
2989,HOMERIC HORSES.,He went on to represent to them the glorious fruits and triumphs of
2990,HOMERIC HORSES.,"victory, but gave no hint of a penalty for defeat. The absence of any"
2991,HOMERIC HORSES.,such savage threat as Antilochus hurled at his slow-paced steeds in the
2992,HOMERIC HORSES.,chariot-race marks his innate gentleness of soul. He urged only the
2993,HOMERIC HORSES.,nobler motives for exertion appropriate to conscious intelligence. Trust
2994,HOMERIC HORSES.,"in equine sympathy is, indeed, widespread in legend and romance. Even"
2995,HOMERIC HORSES.,"the cruel Mezentius, wounded and doomed, made a final appeal to the"
2996,HOMERIC HORSES.,pride and valour of his faithful Rhœbus; to say nothing of ‘Auld

2998,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Reynaud de Montauban, of Marko, the Cid of Servia, of the Eddic Skirnir"

3005,HOMERIC HORSES.,"These, now and then, are enabled to respond; but speaking horses should"
3006,HOMERIC HORSES.,"be reserved for emergencies. They occur, for instance, with undue"
3007,HOMERIC HORSES.,profusion in modern Greek folk-songs. Not every notorious klepht lurking
3008,HOMERIC HORSES.,"in the thickets of Pindus, but only some hero towering to the clouds of"
3009,HOMERIC HORSES.,"fancy, should, rightly considered, possess an animal so exceptionally"
3010,HOMERIC HORSES.,endowed. The lesson is patent in the Iliad. Homer’s instinctive
3011,HOMERIC HORSES.,self-restraint and supreme mastery over the secrets of artistic effect

3061,HOMERIC HORSES.,Xanthus and Balius were the wedding-gift of Poseidon to Peleus. The
3062,HOMERIC HORSES.,"sea-god himself had been a suitor for the hand of the bride, the"
3063,HOMERIC HORSES.,"silver-footed Thetis; but, on its becoming known that the son to be born"
3064,HOMERIC HORSES.,"of her marriage was destined to surpass the strength of his father,"
3065,HOMERIC HORSES.,"something of an Olympian panic prevailed, and a mortal bridegroom was,"
3066,HOMERIC HORSES.,"by the common determination of the alarmed Immortals, forced upon the"
3067,HOMERIC HORSES.,"reluctant goddess. Of this unequal and unhappy marriage, the far-famed"
3068,HOMERIC HORSES.,Achilles was the ill-starred offspring.
3069,HOMERIC HORSES.,
3070,HOMERIC HORSES.,"So intense is the Homeric realisation of the hero’s superhuman powers,"
3071,HOMERIC HORSES.,that they scarcely excite surprise. And his belongings are on the scale
3072,HOMERIC HORSES.,of his qualities. None but himself could wield his spear; his armour was
3073,HOMERIC HORSES.,forged in Olympus; his shield was a panorama of human life; his horses
3074,HOMERIC HORSES.,"would obey only his guidance, or that of his delegates. Not for common"
3075,HOMERIC HORSES.,"handling, indeed, were the ‘wind-swift’ coursers born of Zephyr and the"
3076,HOMERIC HORSES.,Harpy on the verge of the dim Ocean-stream. Themselves deathless and
3077,HOMERIC HORSES.,"invulnerable, they were destined, nevertheless, to share the pangs of"
3078,HOMERIC HORSES.,‘brief mortality.’

3082,HOMERIC HORSES.,"For they had a yoke-fellow of a different strain from their own,"
3083,HOMERIC HORSES.,"captured by Achilles at the sack of the Cilician Thebes, and killed by"
3084,HOMERIC HORSES.,Sarpedon in the course of his duel with Patroclus. And they had to
3085,HOMERIC HORSES.,"endure worse than the loss of Pedasus. Patroclus, whose gentle touch and"
3086,HOMERIC HORSES.,"voice they had long ago learned to love, fell in the same fight, and"
3087,HOMERIC HORSES.,"they stood paralysed with grief, and unheeding alike the blows and the"
3088,HOMERIC HORSES.,"blandishments of their authorised driver, Automedon."
3089,HOMERIC HORSES.,
3090,HOMERIC HORSES.,"They neither to the Hellespont would bear him, nor the fight,"
3091,HOMERIC HORSES.,But still as any tombstone lays his never-stirréd weight
3092,HOMERIC HORSES.,"On some good man or woman’s grave, for rites of funeral,"
3093,HOMERIC HORSES.,"So unremovéd stood these steeds, their heads to earth let fall,"
3094,HOMERIC HORSES.,And warm tears gushing from their eyes with passionate desire
3095,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Of their kind manager; their manes, that flourished with the fire"
3096,HOMERIC HORSES.,"Of endless youth allotted them, fell through the yoky sphere,"
3097,HOMERIC HORSES.,Ruthfully ruffled and defiled.[118]

3351,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,THE establishment of a clear distinction between men and beasts might
3352,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"seem a slight effort of defining intellect, yet it has not been quite"
3353,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,easily made. In children the instinct of assimilation long survives the
3354,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"experience of difference. A little boy of six, asked by the present"
3355,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"writer what profession he thought of adopting, replied with alacrity"
3356,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"that he ‘would like to be a bird,’ and it was only on being reminded of"
3357,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"the diet of grubs associated with that state of life, that he began to"
3358,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,waver as to its desirability. The same incapacity for drawing a
3359,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,boundary-line between the realm of their own imperfect consciousness and
3360,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"the mysterious encompassing region of animal life, is visible in the"
3361,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,grown-up children of the wilds. Hence the zoological speculations of
3362,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,primitive man inevitably take the form of a sort of projection of human
3363,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"faculties into animal natures. Now human faculties, released from the"
3364,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"control of actuality, spontaneously expand. In a vague and vaporous way,"
3365,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"they transcend the low level of hard fact, and become pleasantly"
3366,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,diffused in the ‘ampler ether’ of the unknown. Beasts thus transfigured
3367,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"are incapable, it may be said, of simple rationality. The powers"
3368,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"transferred to them grow like Jack’s Beanstalk, beyond the range of"
3369,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,sight.
3370,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3371,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Universal folk-lore, in all its tangled ramifications, bears witness to"
3372,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"the truth of this remark. Tutelary animals, of the Puss in Boots type,"
3373,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,abound and expatiate there. They are all-contriving and infallible.
3374,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,Their favour leads to fortune and power. They hold the clue to the
3375,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,labyrinth of human destinies. Through their protection the oppressed are
3376,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"rescued, the ragged are clothed in golden raiments, the outwardly"
3377,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"despicable win princely honours, and have their names inscribed in the"
3378,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,‘Almanach de Gotha’ of fairy-land. No wonder that such beneficent
3379,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"potentates, albeit feathered or furry, should have been claimed as"
3380,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,ancestors and hereditary protectors by human beings full of untutored
3381,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"yearnings for the unattainable. To our ideas, indeed, there seems little"
3382,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"comfort or credit to be got out of counting kinship with a beaver, a"
3383,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"bear, or an opossum; but things looked differently when the world was"
3384,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"young; nor has it yet everywhere grown old. In Australia, black bipeds"
3385,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,still own themselves the cousins and clients of kangaroos. American
3386,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Indians pay homage to ‘manitous’ personally, as well as to ‘totems’"
3387,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,tribally associated with them; and twilight tales are perhaps to this
3388,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"hour whispered in Ireland, about a certain ‘Master of the Rats,’ whose"
3389,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,hostility it is eminently undesirable though lamentably easy to incur.
3390,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3391,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Even among Greeks and Romans of the classical age, to say nothing of"
3392,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Aztecs and Alemanni, belief lurked in the preternatural wisdom of"
3393,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"certain animals. Their formal worship, most fully elaborated in Egypt,"
3394,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"but diffused over ‘Tellus’ orbed ground,’ sprang from the same stock of"
3395,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"ideas. To a remarkable extent, the Greeks were exempt from its degrading"
3396,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"associations. Their partial survival on Greek soil, as in the veneration"
3397,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"at Phigaleia, of the horse-headed Demeter, represented, without doubt,"
3398,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"an under-current of aboriginal tradition, reaching back to the Pelasgic"
3399,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,fore-time.
3400,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3401,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,Now it might have been anticipated that the earliest literature would
3402,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,have been the most deeply permeated by these primitive reminiscences.
3403,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,But this is very far from being the case. Their influence is scarcely
3404,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,perceptible in the two great epics of Troy and Ithaca; and indeed the
3405,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,modes of thought from which they originated were completely alien to the
3406,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,ethical sentiments pervading those marvellous first-fruits of Greek
3407,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,genius. Neither poem includes the smallest remnant of zoolatry. The
3408,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,Homeric divinities are absolutely anthropomorphic. They are men and
3409,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"women, exempt from the limitations, unscathed by the ills of humanity,"
3410,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,and radiant with the infinite sunshine of immortal happiness. Of
3411,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,infra-human relationships they exhibit no trace. They are far less
3412,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,concerned with the animal kingdom than they grew to be in classical
3413,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,times. Typical beasts or birds have not yet become attached to them. The
3414,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"eagle, though once in the Iliad called the ‘swift messenger’ of Zeus, is"
3415,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,altogether detached from his throne and his thunder-bolt; Heré has not
3416,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,developed her preference for the peacock—a bird introduced much later
3417,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,from the East; Athene is without the companionship of her owl; no doves
3418,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,flutter about the fair head of the ‘golden Aphrodite’; Artemis needs no
3419,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"dogs to bring down her game. The Olympian menagerie, in short, has not"
3420,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"been constituted. On the ‘many-folded’ mountain of the gods, no beasts"
3421,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,are maintained save the half-dozen horses strictly necessary for the
3422,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,purposes of divine locomotion.
3423,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3424,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Very significant, too, is Homer’s ignorance of the semi-bestial,"
3425,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,semi-divine beings who figure in subsequent Greek mythology. ‘Great Pan’
3426,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,has no place in his verse; Satyrs and Tritons are equally unrecognised
3427,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"by him; his Nereids are ‘silver-footed sea-nymphs,’ with no fishy"
3428,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,tendencies.
3429,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3430,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Mixed natures of any kind seem, in truth, to have been little to his"
3431,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,taste. Even if he could have apprehended the symbolical meanings
3432,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"underlying them in dim Oriental imaginations, he could scarcely have"
3433,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"reconciled himself to the sacrifice of beauty which they involved. Men,"
3434,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"horses, bulls, lions, were all separately admirable in his eyes; but to"
3435,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"blend, he felt instinctively, was not to heighten their perfections."
3436,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Thus, the hybrid nature of the Centaurs, if present to his mind, was"
3437,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"left undefined as something ‘abominable, inutterable.’ The Harpies,"
3438,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"realised by Hesiod as half-human fowls, remained with him barely"
3439,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"personified tornadoes. Neither Pegasus nor the Minotaur, neither the"
3440,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"bird-women of Stymphalis, nor the Griffons of the Rhipæan mountains,"
3441,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"found mention in his song, and he admitted—and that in a"
3442,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,family-legend—but one true specimen of the dragon-kind in the ‘Chimæra
3443,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,dire’ slain by Bellerophon. The monstrosity of Scylla is left purposely
3444,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"vague. She is a fancy-compound defying classification. She lived, too,"
3445,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"in the outer world of the Odyssey, where ‘things strange and rare’"
3446,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,flourished in quiet disregard of laws binding elsewhere.
3447,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3448,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,In the same region of wonderland occur the oxen of the Sun—the only
3449,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,sacred animals recognised by our poet. They had their pasturing-ground
3450,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"in the island of Thrinakie, whither Helios retired to divert himself"
3451,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,with their frolics after each hard day of steady Mediterranean shining;
3452,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,and so keen was his indignation at their slaughter by the famished
3453,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"comrades of Odysseus, that a cosmical strike would have ensued but for"
3454,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,the promise of Zeus to inflict condign punishment upon the delinquents.
3455,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"From the shipwreck by which this promise was fulfilled, Odysseus, alone"
3456,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"exempt from guilt in the matter, was the solitary survivor."
3457,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3458,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"The Homeric treatment of animals, compared with the extravagances"
3459,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"prevalent in other primitive literature, is eminently sane and rational."
3460,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,Not through indifference to their perfections. A peculiar intensity of
3461,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"sympathy with brute-nature is, on the contrary, one of the"
3462,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,distinguishing characteristics of the Homeric poems. But that sympathy
3463,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"is based upon the appreciation of real, not upon the transference of"
3464,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"imaginary qualities. Beasts are, on the whole, kept strictly in their"
3465,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,proper places. The only genuine example of their sublimation into higher
3466,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"ones is afforded by the horses of Achilles, and this during a transport"
3467,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"of epic excitement. Otherwise, the fabulous element admitted concerning"
3468,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,animals—and it is just in their regard that fable commonly runs riot—is
3469,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,surprisingly small.
3470,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3471,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"In its room, we find such a wealth of acute and accurate observation, as"
3472,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"no poet, before or since, has had the capacity to accumulate, or the"
3473,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,power to employ for purposes of illustration. It is unmistakably private
3474,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,property. Details appropriated at second-hand could never have fitted in
3475,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"so aptly with the needs of imaginative creation. Moreover, the"
3476,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,conventional types of animal character were of later establishment.
3477,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,There was at that early time no recognised common stock of popular or
3478,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,proverbial wisdom on the subject to draw upon. The lion had not yet been
3479,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"raised to regal dignity; the fox was undistinguished for craft, as the"
3480,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,goose for folly. Beasts and birds had their careers in literature before
3481,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,them. Their reputations were still to make. They carried about with them
3482,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,no formal certificates of character. The poet was accordingly unfettered
3483,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,in his dealings with them by preconceived notions; whence the delightful
3484,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"freshness of Homer’s zoological vignettes. The dew of morning, so to"
3485,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"speak, is upon them. They are limned direct from his own vivid"
3486,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"impressions of pastoral, maritime, and hunting scenes."
3487,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3488,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"As to the locality of those scenes, some hints, but scarcely more than"
3489,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"hints, can be derived. For in the course of nearly three thousand years,"
3490,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,the circumstances of animal distribution have been affected by changes
3491,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,too considerable and too indeterminate to admit of confident argument
3492,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,from the state of things now to the state of things then; while the
3493,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"notices of the poet, incidental by their very nature, are of the utmost"
3494,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"value for what they tell, but warrant only very hesitating inferences"
3495,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"from what they leave untold. Thus, it does not follow that because Homer"
3496,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"nowhere mentions the cuckoo, he was therefore unfamiliar with its note,"
3497,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"which, from Hesiod’s time until now, has not failed to proclaim the"
3498,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"advent of spring among the olive-groves of Bœotia, and must have been"
3499,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,heard no less by Paris or Anchises than by the modern archæological
3500,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"traveller, along the oak-clad and willow-fringed valley of Scamander."
3501,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,Nor is the faintest presumption of a divided authorship supplied by the
3502,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"fact that the nightingale sings in the Odyssey, but not in the Iliad."
3503,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Nevertheless, analogous considerations should not be altogether"
3504,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,neglected in Homeric criticism. They may possibly help towards the
3505,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"answering of questions both of time and place: of time, through"
3506,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"allusions to domesticated animals; of place, by a comparison of the"
3507,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"known range of wild species with the fauna of the two great epics. And,"
3508,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"first, as regards domesticated animals."
3509,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3510,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,The list of these is a short one. The Greeks and Trojans of the Iliad
3511,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"commanded the services of the horse in battle, of oxen and mules for"
3512,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"draught; dogs were their faithful allies in hunting and cattle driving,"
3513,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"and they kept flocks of sheep and goats. The ass appears only once, and"
3514,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"then indirectly, on the scene, when the lethargic obstinacy of his"
3515,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,behaviour serves to heighten the effect of Ajax’s stubbornness in fight.
3516,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,Thus:
3517,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3518,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,And as when a lazy ass going past a field hath the better of the
3519,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"boys with him, an ass that hath had many a cudgel broken about"
3520,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"his sides, and he fareth into the deep crop, and wasteth it,"
3521,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"while the boys smite him with their cudgels, and feeble is the"
3522,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"force of them, but yet with might and main they drive him forth"
3523,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,when he hath had his fill of fodder; even so did the
3524,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"high-hearted Trojans and allies, called from many lands, smite"
3525,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"great Aias, son of Telamon, with darts on the centre of his"
3526,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"shield, and ever followed after him.[136]"

3533,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"mention of him or them is omitted from the Odyssey, as well as from the"
3534,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,Hesiodic poems. His existence is indeed implied by the parentage of the
3535,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,mule. But mules were brought to the Troad _ready-made_ from
3536,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,Paphlagonia.[137] It was not until later that they were systematically
3537,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,bred by the Greeks.

3543,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3544,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,The Semitic origin of the word ‘ass’ rightly indicates the introduction
3545,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,of the species into Europe from Semitic Western Asia. As to the date of
3546,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"its arrival, all that can be told is that it was subsequent to the"
3547,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,beginning of the bronze epoch. The pile-dwellers of Switzerland and
3548,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,North Italy were unacquainted with an animal fundamentally Oriental in
3549,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"its habitudes. Its reluctance, for instance, to cross the smallest"
3550,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,streamlet attests the physical tradition of a desert home; and the white
3551,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"ass of Bagdad represents to this day, the fullest capabilities of the"
3552,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,race.[138] Yet neither the ass nor the camel was included in the
3553,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"primitive Aryan fauna. For they could not have been known, still less"
3554,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"domesticated, without being named, and the only widespread appellations"
3555,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,borne by them are derived from Semitic sources. Evidently the loan of
3556,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,the words accompanied the transmission of the species. It is very
3557,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"difficult, in the face of this circumstance—as Dr. Schrader has"
3558,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,pertinently observed[139]—to locate the Aryan cradle-land anywhere to
3559,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,the east of the Bosphorus.

3572,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,to have halted in a transition-stage between pastoral and agricultural
3573,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"life, by far the larger proportion of the land supplying pasturage for"
3574,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"ubiquitous multitudes of sheep, oxen, goats, horses, and asses. The"
3575,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"sheep, however, belong to a variety assuredly of post-Homeric"

3577,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,not well have escaped characterisation in some emphatic Homeric epithet.

3586,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,resembling more closely than the former those with which Homer was
3587,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"acquainted. The oxen alike of the Iliad and Odyssey are ‘wine-coloured,’"
3588,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"‘straight-horned,’ ‘broad-browed,’ and ‘sinuous-footed’; it was above"
3589,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"all through the shuffle of their gait, indicated by the last adjective,"
3590,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"and due to the peculiar structure of the hip-joint in the whole species,"
3591,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"that the poet distinctively visualised them. ‘Lowing kine,’ and"
3592,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"‘bellowing bulls’ are occasionally heard of, chiefly—it is curious to"
3593,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"remark—in later, or suspected portions of the Iliad. Sheep and goats, on"
3594,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"the other hand, are often described as ‘bleating,’ and the cries of"
3595,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,birds are called up at opportune moments; but Homer’s horses neither
3596,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,whinny nor neigh; his pigs refrain from grunting; his jackals do not
3597,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,howl; the tremendous roar of the lion nowhere resounds through his
3598,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"forests. Homeric wild beasts are, indeed, save in the vaguely-indicated"
3599,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"case of one indeterminate specimen,[141] wholly dumb."

3607,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,silent. Even the perpetuated cry of the Laocoön detracts somewhat from
3608,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,the inherent serenity of marble. The metal-wrought creations of
3609,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Hephæstus, however, not only live and move, but make themselves audible"
3610,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"to a degree uncommon elsewhere in the poems. Thus, in one scene, or"
3611,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"compartment, a _lowing_ herd issues to the pasturing-grounds, where two"
3612,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"lions seize from their midst, and devour, a _loudly-bellowing_ bull,"
3613,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"while nine _barking_, though frightened dogs are, by the herdsmen,"
3614,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"vainly urged to a rescue. In the vintage-episode of the same series,"
3615,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,delight in melodious beauty is almost as apparent as in the so-called
3616,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"‘Homeric’ hymn to Hermes. The ‘Linus-song,’ ‘sweet even as desire,’ sung"

3629,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"known, remained, during a millennium or two, exclusively Egyptian; then"
3630,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"all at once, perhaps owing to the exigency created by the migration"
3631,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"westward of the rat, spread with great rapidity in the first centuries"
3632,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"of the Christian era, over the civilised world. Saint Gregory Nazianzen"
3633,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,set the first recorded European example of attachment to a cat. His pet

3657,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,The absence of Vedic or Avestan mention of swine-culture makes it
3658,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,practically certain that the species was known only in a wild state to
3659,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,the early Aryan colonists of Iran and India. Nor had any more intimate
3660,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,acquaintance with it been developed in Babylonia; although the Swiss

3664,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,conjecture that the subjugation of the ‘full-acorned boar’ was first
3665,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"accomplished in Europe;[145] and if this were so, the operations of"
3666,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,swine-herding would naturally come in for a larger share of notice in
3667,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"the Odyssey, as the more European of the two poems, than in the Iliad."
3668,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"And in fact, the swineherd of Odysseus is an important personage, and"

3707,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"scarcely be without real significance. The species employed, in the"

3709,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"marshy banks of the Cayster, the clangorous march-past of the Achæan"

3724,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"they were early transported to Iran, where the cock, as the bird that"
3725,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"first greets the light, acquired in the eyes of Zoroastrian devotees, a"
3726,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,pre-eminently sacred character. His introduction into Greece was a
3727,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,result of the expansion westward of the Persian empire. No cocks are met
3728,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,with on Egyptian monuments; the Old Testament leaves them unnoticed; and
3729,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,the earliest mention of them in Greek literature is by Theognis of
3730,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Megara, in the middle of the sixth century B.C.[149] Pigeons, on the"
3731,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"other hand, are quite at home in Homeric verse. They are of two kinds."
3732,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"One is the rock-pigeon, called from its slate-coloured plumage _peleia_"
3733,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"(πελόs = dusky), and described as finding shelter in rocky clefts, and"
3734,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"evading pursuit by a rapid, undulating flight.[150] Its frequent"
3735,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,recurrence in similes can surprise no traveller who has observed the
3736,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,extreme abundance of _Columba livia_ all round the coasts of the
3737,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Ægean.[151] The second Homeric species of _Columba_ is the ring-dove,"
3738,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,once referred to as the habitual victim of the hawk. Tame pigeons are
3739,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"ignored, and were, indeed, first seen in Greece after the wreck of the"
3740,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,Persian fleet at Mount Athos in 492 B.C.[152] Yet dove-culture was
3741,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,practised as far back as the oldest records lead us in Egypt and Persia.
3742,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,The dove was marked out as a ‘death-bird’ by our earliest Aryan
3743,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"ancestors, and figures in the Vedas as a messenger of Yama. But Homer,"

3763,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Among Homeric wild animals, the first place incontestably belongs to the"
3764,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"lion, and the Iliad, in especial, gives extraordinary prominence to the"
3765,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"king of beasts. In savage grandeur he stalks, as it were, through the"
3766,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"varied scenery of its similitudes, indomitable, fiercely-despoiling,"
3767,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,contemptuous of lesser brute-forces. His impressive qualities receive no
3768,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,gratuitous enhancement; he rouses no myth-making fancies; there is no
3769,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"fabulous ‘quality of mercy’ about him, nor of magnanimity, nor of"
3770,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"forbearance; he is simply a ‘gaunt and sanguine beast,’ a vivid"
3771,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,embodiment of the energy of untamed and unsparing nature.
3772,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3773,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,He is not brought immediately upon the scene of action; the Homeric
3774,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,poems nowhere provide for him a local habitation; it is only in the
3775,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,comparatively late Hymn to Aphrodite that a place is specifically
3776,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"assigned to him among the feral products of Mount Ida. His portraiture,"
3777,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"nevertheless, in the similes of the Iliad is too minute and faithful to"
3778,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,leave any shadow of doubt of its being based upon intimate personal
3779,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,acquaintance. The poet must have witnessed with his own eyes the change
3780,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,from majestic indifference to bellicose frenzy described in the
3781,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,following passage; he must have caught the greenish glare of the oblique
3782,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"feline eyes, noted the preparatory tail-lashings, and mentally"
3783,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"photographed the crouching attitude, and the yawn of deadly"
3784,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"significance, that preceded the fierce beast’s spring."
3785,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3786,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"And on the other side, the son of Peleus rushed to meet him,"
3787,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"like a lion, a ravaging lion whom men desire to slay, a whole"
3788,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"tribe assembled; and first he goeth his way unheeding, but when"
3789,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"some warrior-youth hath smitten him with a spear, then he"
3790,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"gathereth himself open-mouthed, and foam cometh forth about his"
3791,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"teeth, and his stout spirit groaneth in his heart, and with his"
3792,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,tail he scourgeth either side his ribs and flanks and goadeth
3793,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"himself on to fight, and glaring is borne straight on them by"
3794,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"his passion to try whether he shall slay some man of them, or"
3795,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,whether himself shall perish in the forefront of the
3796,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,throng.[153]

3880,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"legendary traces remain, although he figures largely in Mycenæan art;"
3881,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,but in Thrace he can lay claim to an historically attested existence.

3889,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,of Polybius and Dio Chrysostom leave no doubt that he had finally

3901,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"A Thessalian Homer might, then, quite conceivably, have beheld an"
3902,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,occasional predatory lion descending the arbutus-clad slopes of Pelion
3903,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,or Olympus; yet the continual allusions to leonine manners and customs
3904,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,pervading the Iliad show an habitual acquaintance with the animal which
3905,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"is certainly somewhat surprising. It corresponds, nevertheless, quite"
3906,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,closely with the perpetual recurrence of his form in the plastic
3907,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,representations of Mycenæ.
3908,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3909,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,The comparatively few Odyssean references to this animal can scarcely be
3910,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,said to bear the stamp of visual directness unmistakably belonging to
3911,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,those dispersed broadcast through the earlier epic. Yet it would
3912,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"probably be a mistake to suppose them derived at second-hand. Without,"
3913,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"then, denying that the author of the Odyssey had actually ‘met the ravin"
3914,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"lion when he roared,’ we may express some wonder that he, like his"
3915,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"predecessor of the Iliad, left unrecorded the auditory part of the"
3916,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,resulting brain-impression. For the voice of the lion is assuredly the
3917,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,most imposing sound of which animated nature seems capable. Casual
3918,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,allusions to it in the Hymn to Aphrodite and in the (nominally) Hesiodic
3919,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"‘Shield of Hercules,’ are, nevertheless, perhaps the earliest extant in"
3920,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,Greek literature.
3921,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3922,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"The bear figures in the Iliad and Odyssey solely as a constellation,"
3923,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,except that a couple of verses interpolated into the latter accord him a
3924,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,place among the embossed decorations of the belt of Hercules. The living
3925,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"animal, however, is still reported to lurk in the ‘clov’n ravines’ of"
3926,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"‘many-fountain’d Ida,’ and, according to a local tradition, was only"
3927,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,banished from the Thessalian Olympus through the agency of Saint
3928,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Dionysius.[162] The panther or leopard, on the contrary, although"
3929,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"contemporaneously with the cave-lion an inmate of Britain, disappeared"
3930,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"from Europe at a dim and remote epoch, while plentifully met with in"
3931,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,Caria and Pamphylia during Cicero’s governorship of Cilicia. Even in the
3932,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"present century, indeed, leopardskins formed part of the recognised"
3933,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"tribute of the Pasha of the Dardanelles. The life-like scene, then, in"
3934,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"which the animal emerges to view in the Iliad, bears a decidedly Asiatic"
3935,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,character. Mr. Conington’s version of the lines runs as follows:
3936,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3937,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,As panther springs from a deep thicket’s shade
3938,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"To meet the hunter, and her heart no fear"
3939,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Nor terror knows, though barking loud she hear,"
3940,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,For though with weapon’s thrust or javelin’s throw
3941,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"He wound her first, yet e’en about the spear"
3942,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Writhing, her valour doth she not forego,"
3943,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Till for offence she close, or in the shock lie low.[163]"

3975,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Being ireful, on the lion he will venture;"
3976,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
3977,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,and the laying-low of a single specimen is reckoned no inadequate result

3980,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"in 1850, to the joint efforts, during several toilsome days, of a band"

4005,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"the valour of individual chiefs, while the rank and file figure as"
4006,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"wolves and jackals, hunting in packs, pinched with hunger, bloodthirsty"
4007,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"and desperately eager, but formidable only collectively. Jackals still"
4008,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"abound in the Troad and throughout the Cyclades, and their hideous wails"
4009,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,and barkings enhance the desolation of the Nauplian and Negropontine
4010,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,swamps.[167] Neither have wolves disappeared from those regions; and the
4011,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,old dread of the animal which was at once the symbol of darkness and of
4012,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"light, survives obscurely to this day in the vampire-superstitions of"
4013,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,Eastern Europe. The closeness of the connexion between vampires and
4014,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,were-wolves is shown by a comparison of the modern Greek word
4015,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"_vrykolaka_, vampire, with the Zend and Sanskrit _vehrka_, a wolf.[168]"
4016,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,Nor were the Greeks of classical times exempt from the persuasion that
4017,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"men and wolves might temporarily, or even permanently, exchange"
4018,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,semblances. Many stories of the kind were related in Arcadia in
4019,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"connexion with the worship of the Lycæan Zeus; and Pausanias, while"
4020,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"critically sceptical as regards some of these, was not too advanced a"
4021,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"thinker to accept, as fully credible, the penal transformation of"
4022,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Lycaon, son of Pelasgus.[169] Such notions belonged, however, to a"
4023,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,rustic mythology of which Homer took small cognisance. His thoughts
4024,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,travelled of themselves out from the sylvan gloom of primeval haunts
4025,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,into the open sunshine of unadulterated nature.
4026,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
4027,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"In wood or wilderness, forest or den,"
4028,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
4029,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,he met with no bogey-animals. For him neither beast nor bird had any
4030,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,mysterious significance. He attributed to encounters with particular
4031,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"species no influence, malefic or beneficial, upon human destiny. Of"
4032,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"themselves, they had, in his view, no concern with it, although ordinary"
4033,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"animal instincts might, under certain conditions, be so directed as to"
4034,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"be expressive to man of the will of the gods. In the Homeric scheme,"
4035,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"birds and serpents exclusively are so employed, without, however, any"
4036,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"departure from the order of nature. Thus, by night near the sedgy"
4037,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Simoeis, a heron, _Ardea nycticorax_, disturbed by the approach of"

4077,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,
4078,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,appeared such only by virtue of the critical nature of the conjuncture
4079,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"at which it was displayed. Hector, relying upon what he took to be a"

4081,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"rout of battle, of the Greek camp, and the conflagration of the Greek"

4083,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"the irate epical hero lay inert, but ready to spring into action at the"
4084,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,last extremity; and it was fully recognised that the arming of Achilles
4085,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,meant far more than the mere loss of the fruits of victory. The balance
4086,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"of events, then, if the proposed _coup de main_ were persevered with,"
4087,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,hung upon a knife-edge of destiny; and pale fear might well invade the
4088,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"eager, yet hesitating Trojan host when, just as the foremost warriors"

4121,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,The eagle is virtually the Homeric king of birds. He is in the Iliad
4122,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"‘the most perfect,’ as well as ‘the strongest and swiftest of flying"
4123,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"things’; his appearances in both poems, often expressly ordained by"
4124,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Zeus, are always momentous, and are, accordingly, eagerly watched and"
4125,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"solicitously interpreted; moreover, they never deceive; to disregard the"
4126,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"warning they convey is to rush spontaneously to destruction. It is only,"
4127,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"however, in the Twenty-fourth Iliad, usually regarded as subsequent, in"
4128,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"point of composition, to the cantos embodying the primitive legend of"
4129,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"the ‘Wrath of Achilles,’ that the eagle begins to be marked out as the"
4130,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"special envoy of Zeus. Later, the companionship became so close as to"
4131,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,justify Æschylus in implying that the bird was in lieu of a dog to the
4132,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"‘father of gods and men.’ The position, on the other hand, assigned, in"
4133,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"one passage of the Odyssey, to the hawk as the ‘swift messenger’ of"
4134,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Apollo, was not maintained. The Hellenic Phœbus eventually disclaimed"
4135,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,all relationship with the hawk-headed Horus of the Nile Valley. The
4136,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"rapidity, however, of the hawk’s flight, and his agility in the pursuit"
4137,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"of his prey, furnish our poet, again and again, with terms of"
4138,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"comparison. Here is an example, taken from the description of the deadly"
4139,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,duel outside the Scæan gate.

4141,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"As when a falcon, bird of swiftest flight,"

4143,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Swoops fiercely down; she, from beneath, in fear,"
4144,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"Evades the stroke; he, dashing through the brake,"

4146,HOMERIC ZOOLOGY.,"So, wing’d with desp’rate hate, Achilles flew,"

4361,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,legendary associations with vegetable growths. The treatment of the
4362,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"Homeric flora, like that of the Homeric fauna, is essentially simple and"
4363,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"direct. One magic herb has a place in it, and the ‘enchanted stem’ of"
4364,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,the lotus bears fruit of inexplicable potency over the subtly compounded
4365,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,human organism; but tree-worship is as remote from the poet’s thoughts
4366,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"as animal-worship, and flower-myths seem equally beyond his ken. He knew"
4367,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,of no ‘love-lies-bleeding’ stories interpreting the passionate glow of
4368,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,scarlet petals; nor of ‘forget-me-not’ stories fitted to the more tender

4380,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"The oak has been called the king of the forest, as the lion the king of"
4381,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,beasts. But its supremacy is largely a thing of the past. To the early
4382,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"undivided Aryans, it was the tree of trees. Their common name for it,"
4383,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"which survived with its original special meaning in Celtic and Greek,"
4384,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"came, in other languages, to denote the generalised conception of a"
4385,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"tree, showing the oak to have been pre-eminent in their common ancestral"
4386,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,home. Traces of this shifting of the linguistic standpoint are preserved
4387,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"in some Homeric phrases. Thus, _drûs_—etymologically identical with the"
4388,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"English _tree_—means, not only an oak, but, most probably, the"
4389,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"particular kind of oak familiar to us in England—_Quercus robur_, ‘the"
4390,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,unwedgeable and gnarled oak’ of Shakespeare. But the generic
4391,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,significance gradually infused into the specific term comes to the front
4392,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"in several of its compounds. A wood-cutter, for instance, is, in the"
4393,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"Iliad, literally an ‘oak-cutter,’ and the ‘solemn shade’ round Circe’s"
4394,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"dwelling was afforded, etymologically, by an oaken grove, although the"
4395,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,meaning really conveyed by the word _drûma_ was that of a collection of
4396,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"forest-trees of undetermined and various kinds. In later Greek, too, we"
4397,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"find a woodpecker styled an ‘oakpecker’; and the Dryades, while in name"
4398,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"‘oak-nymphs,’ were, in point of fact, unrestricted in their choice of an"
4399,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"arboreal dwelling-place. By a curious survival of associations, the name"
4400,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"in modern Greek of this antique forest-constituent is _dendron_, a tree;"
4401,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,yet it is now by no means common in Greece. Homer’s oaks were
4402,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"mountain-reared, sturdy, proof against most contingencies of climate. Of"
4403,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"similar nature were Leonteus and Polypœtes, of the rugged Lapith race,"
4404,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,who indomitably held the way into the Greek camp against the mighty
4405,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"Asius. ‘These twain,’ we are told, ‘stood in front of the lofty gates,"
4406,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"like high-crested oak-trees in the hills, that for ever abide the wind"
4407,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"and rain, firm fixed with roots great and long.’[188]"

4413,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,The species of oak at present dominant both in Greece and the Troad is
4414,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"the ‘oak of Bashan,’ _Quercus ægilops_. Its fruit, the valonia in"
4415,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"commercial demand for tanning purposes, was made serviceable, within"
4416,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"Homer’s experience, under the almost identical name of _balanoi_, only"
4417,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"as food for pigs. Homer’s name for this fine tree—extended, perhaps, to"
4418,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"the closely allied _Quercus esculus_—is _phegos_, signifying ‘edible,’"
4419,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"and denoting, in other European languages, the beech. How, then, did it"
4420,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"come to be transferred, south of the Ceraunian mountains, to a totally"
4421,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,different kind of tree? The explanation is simple. No beeches grew in
4422,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,the Hellenic peninsula when the first Aryan settlers entered it. A word
4423,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"was hence left derelict, and was naturally claimed by a conspicuous"
4424,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"forest-tree, until then anonymous, because unknown further north, which"
4425,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,shared with the beech its characteristic quality—so the necessities of
4426,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"hunger caused it to be esteemed—of producing fruit capable, after a"
4427,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"fashion, of supporting life.[189] So, in the United States, the English"
4428,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"names ‘robin,’ ‘hemlock,’ ‘maple,’ and probably many others, were"
4429,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"unceremoniously handed on to strange species, on the strength of some"
4430,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,casual or superficial resemblances.[190] The tradition of acorn-eating
4431,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,connected with the rustic Arcadians applied evidently to the fruit of
4432,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"the valonia-oak, or one of its nearest congeners;[191] and the oracular"
4433,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"oak of Dodona, to which Odysseus pretended to have hied for counsel,"
4434,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,appears to have been of the same description; as was certainly the tree
4435,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"of Zeus before the Scæan gate, whence Apollo and Athene watched the"
4436,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"single combat between Hector and Ajax, and beneath which the spear of"
4437,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,Tlepolemus was wrenched from the flesh of the fainting Sarpedon. These
4438,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"two are the only trees divinely appropriated in Homeric verse, and they"
4439,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,command but a small share of the reverence paid by Celts and Teutons to
4440,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,their sacred oaks.

4454,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"The beech is an encroaching tree. Wherever it is capable of thriving, it"
4455,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"tends to replace the oak, which has lost, apparently, a great part of"
4456,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,its old propagative energy. Possibly its exposure to the attacks of
4457,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"countless insect-enemies, from which the beech enjoys immunity, may"
4458,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,account for its comparative helplessness in the battle for life. The
4459,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"beech is, at any rate, now the typical tree of central Europe; it has"
4460,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"aided in the extirpation of the ancient oak-forests of Jutland, and has"
4461,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"established itself, within the historic period, in Scotland and"
4462,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"Ireland.[192] Its habitat is, however, bounded to the east by a line"
4463,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,drawn from Königsberg on the Baltic to the Caucasus; it is not found in
4464,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"the Troad, or in Greece south of a track crossing the peninsula from the"
4465,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"Gulf of Arta to the Gulf of Volo. It grows freely, however, on the"
4466,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"slopes of the Mysian Olympus, as well as on Mount Pelion in Thessaly. At"
4467,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"the beginning of the Macedonian era, too, Dicæarchus[193] described the"
4468,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"thick foliage of Pelion as prevalently beechen, though cypresses, silver"
4469,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"firs, junipers, and maples, also abounded, the last three kinds of tree"
4470,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"having since disappeared, while the beech seems to have only just held"
4471,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"its ground.[194] Its relative importance, then, five hundred years"
4472,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"earlier, is not likely to have been very different; yet Homer, who"
4473,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"certainly knew a good deal about Pelion, whether by report, or from"
4474,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"observation, never mentions the beech. It is true that we cannot argue"
4475,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,with any confidence from omission to ignorance. An epic is not an
4476,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,encyclopædia. The illustrations employed in it are not necessarily
4477,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"exhaustive of all that the poet’s world contains. We can, then, be"
4478,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,certain of nothing more than that Homer’s idea of a typical forest did
4479,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"not include the beech. Its appearance, then, in the following spirited"
4480,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"lines from Mr. Way’s excellent translation of the Iliad, has no warrant"

4669,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"is the literary embodiment of this popular idea. Evidently, then, the"
4670,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,trees of mourning in the Iliad and Odyssey were singled out owing to
4671,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"their possession of a common, though by no means obvious peculiarity;"
4672,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,yet their selection in each poem is different. This is the more
4673,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"remarkable because associations of the sort, once established, are"
4674,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,almost ineradicable from what we may call tribal consciousness.
4675,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"Cypresses have no share in them, so far as Homer is concerned. Their"
4676,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,appointment to the office of mourning the dead would seem to have been
4677,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"subsequently resolved upon. The connexion was, at any rate, well"
4678,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"established before the close of the classic age, when funeral-pyres were"
4679,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"made by preference of cypress wood, the tree itself being consecrated to"
4680,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,the hated Dis.[211] And Pausanias met with groves of cypresses
4681,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"surrounding the tomb of Laïs near Corinth, and of Alcmæon, son of the"
4682,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"ill-fated seer Amphiaraus, at Psophis in Arcadia.[212] The tradition"

4713,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,relates—with double rows of willows intermixed with tamarisks and young
4714,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"elms. If no such robust trunk is now to be seen as that of the elm-tree,"
4715,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"by the help of which Achilles struggled out of the raging torrent, the"
4716,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"deficiency is accidental, not inherent. Potential trees are kept"

4723,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"Along the Asmak, dense growths of asphodel send up flower-stalks"

4746,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"one day, in full view of the astonished Achæans, a serpent crept up its"

4749,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"deglutition of the mother-bird, was then and there turned into"
4750,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"stone.[215] The decade of consumed sparrows—mother and chicks—signified,"
4751,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"according to the interpretation of Calchas, the ten years of the siege"
4752,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,of Troy; and the reality of the event was attested to later generations

4768,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"of the species, whence the Phœnicians had not failed to transport it"

4770,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"of novelties, shared the name ‘Phœnix’ with the brilliant colour"
4771,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,produced by the Tyrian dye. But its introduction seems to belong to the
4772,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"later Achæan age. For the palm is unknown in the Iliad, and emerges only"
4773,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"once in the Odyssey,[217] although then with particular emphasis. The"
4774,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,individual tree seen by Homer was probably the first planted on Greek
4775,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"soil. It spread its crown of leaves above the shrine of Apollo, at"
4776,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,Delos. And when the storm-tossed Odysseus set his wits to work to win
4777,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,the protection of Nausicaa—a matter of life or death to him at the
4778,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,moment—he could think of no more flattering comparison for the youthful

4780,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"tall, arboreal exotic. A tradition, not reported by Homer, who nowhere"

4971,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"colour-epithet, which he employed, one might make bold to say, without"
4972,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"over-nice discrimination. The sea might indeed, under certain aspects,"
4973,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,be fitly so described; but iron makes a very distant approach to the hue

4975,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"clothed the flock of Polyphemus in violet fleeces. Polyphemus, to be"
4976,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"sure, lived in a semi-fabulous world, where it has been suggested[231]"
4977,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"that wool might conceivably _grow dyed_, as in the restored Saturnian"
4978,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,kingdom imagined by Virgil;[232] and the dark-blue material attached to
4979,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"Helen’s golden distaff[233] was evidently a far-travelled rarity, such"
4980,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,as might be produced by the use of a foreign dye. But there is no
4981,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"evidence of primitive acquaintance with a blue dye; indeed, if one had"

5010,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"choicest luxuries of Rome, and a medicine in high ancient and mediæval"
5011,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,repute. But its vogue has passed. Saffron slippers are no longer an
5012,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,appanage of supreme dignity; the ‘saffron wings’ of Iris are folded; the
5013,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,‘saffron robes’ of the Dawn retain the glamour only of what they

5019,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"Arabic _sahafaran_ of the second, developed out of _assfar_, yellow, and"
5020,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"represented by the Spanish _azafran_, whence our ‘saffron.’ The plant"
5021,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"was widely and profitably cultivated under Moorish rule in Spain, and"
5022,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"was probably introduced by the Phœnicians into Greece, though the common"
5023,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"vernal crocus is certainly indigenous there, its white and purple cups"
5024,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"begemming all the declivities of ‘Hellas and Argos.’ The saffron-crocus,"
5025,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"too, now grows wild in such dry and chalky soil as Sunium and Hymettus"
5026,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,afford;[235] yet its name betrays its foreign affinities. Saffron-tinted
5027,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"garments had perhaps never, down to Homer’s time, been seen in Greece"
5028,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"itself; he was beyond doubt unacquainted with the actual use of the dye,"
5029,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,and distributed with the utmost parsimony the splendour conferred by it.
5030,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"Not only were mere mortals excluded from a share in it, neither Hecuba"

5081,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"track of their progressive transmissions. Thus, the mountain Rhodope in"

5083,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,the ‘crocus-purple hour’ of her capture by ‘gloomy Dis;’ and in the same

5085,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"for a snare of enticement to the damsel, ablaze with roses and lilies,"
5086,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"‘a marvel to behold,’ with narcissus, crocuses, violets, and"
5087,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"hyacinths.[239] Moreover, roses, each with sixty leaves, and highly"

5089,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,King Midas;[240] Theophrastus places near Philippi the original habitat

5105,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,Dim rumours of their loveliness spread among the Homeric Greeks. The
5106,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"standing Odyssean designation of Eos as ‘rosy-fingered,’ alternating, in"
5107,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"the Iliad, with ‘saffron-robed,’ heralded, it might be said, the"
5108,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,European advent of the flower itself. For rose-gardens can have lain
5109,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,only just below the Homeric horizon. Their ambrosial products did not
5110,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"indeed come within mortal reach, but were at the disposal of the gods."
5111,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"By the application of oil of roses, Aphrodite kept the body of Hector"
5112,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,fresh and fair during the twelve days of its savage maltreatment by
5113,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,Achilles; and oil of roses was later an accredited antiseptic.
5114,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,Archilochus seems to have been the first Greek poet to make living
5115,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"acquaintance with the blushing flower of Dionysus and Aphrodite, which"
5116,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,became known likewise only to the writers of the later books of

5120,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"Allusions to the lily do not occur in the Odyssey, and are vague and"

5122,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"appropriately, be designated ‘lily-like’; but the same term applied to"
5123,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,sounds conveys little or no meaning to our minds. Even if we admit a
5124,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"far-fetched analogy between the song of the Muses, as something uncommon"
5125,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"and tenderly beautiful, and a fragile white flower, we have to confess"
5126,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,ourselves bewildered by the extension of the comparison to the shrill
5127,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"voices of cicadas, rasping out their garrulous contentment amidst summer"
5128,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,foliage.
5129,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,
5130,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"The slenderness, then, of Homer’s acquaintance with the finer kinds of"
5131,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"bloom introduced gradually from the East, is apparent from his seeming"
5132,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"ignorance of their ravishing perfumes, no less than from the inadequacy"
5133,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,of his hints as to their beauty of form and colour. His love of flowers
5134,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,was in the instinctive stage; it had not come to the maturity of
5135,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,self-consciousness. They obtained recognition from him neither as
5136,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"symbols of feeling, nor as accessories to enjoyment. Nausicaa wove no"
5137,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,garlands; the cultivation of flowers in the gardens of Alcinous is left
5138,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"doubtful; Laertes pruned his pear-trees, and dug round his vines, but"
5139,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,reared for his solace not so much as a poppy. No display of living
5140,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,jewellery aided the seductions of Circe’s island; Calypso was content to
5141,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,plant the unpretending violet; Aphrodite herself was without a floral
5142,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,badge; floral decorations of every kind were equally unthought of.
5143,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"Flowers, in fact, had not yet been brought within the sphere of human"
5144,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,sentiment; they had not yet acquired significance as emblems of human
5145,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,passion; they had not yet been made partners with humanity in the
5146,TREES AND FLOWERS IN HOMER.,"sorrows of death, and the transient pleasures of a troubled and"

5159,HOMERIC MEALS.,
5160,HOMERIC MEALS.,"HEROIC appetites were strong and simple. They craved ‘much meat,’ and"
5161,HOMERIC MEALS.,could be completely appeased with nothing else; but they demanded little
5162,HOMERIC MEALS.,more. They needed no savoury caresses or spicy blandishments. Occasion
5163,HOMERIC MEALS.,"indeed to stimulate them there was none, though much difficulty might"
5164,HOMERIC MEALS.,arise about satisfying them. For they disdained paltry subterfuges.
5165,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Fish, game, and vegetables they accepted in lieu of more substantial"
5166,HOMERIC MEALS.,"prey; but under protest. Hunger, in consenting to receive such trifles,"
5167,HOMERIC MEALS.,merely compounded for a partial settlement of her claim.
5168,HOMERIC MEALS.,
5169,HOMERIC MEALS.,"The Homeric bill of fare was concise, and admitted of slight"
5170,HOMERIC MEALS.,"diversification. Day after day, and at meal after meal, roast meat,"
5171,HOMERIC MEALS.,"bread, and wine were set before perennially eager guests, in whose"
5172,HOMERIC MEALS.,esteem any fundamental change in the materials of the banquet would
5173,HOMERIC MEALS.,"certainly have been for the worse. Variety, in fact, was in the inverse"
5174,HOMERIC MEALS.,ratio of abundance. Want alone counselled departures from the beaten
5175,HOMERIC MEALS.,"track of opulent feasting, and compelled the reluctant adoption of"
5176,HOMERIC MEALS.,inadequate expedients for silencing the imperative outcries of famine.
5177,HOMERIC MEALS.,Nevertheless it cannot be supposed that the epical setting forth of
5178,HOMERIC MEALS.,Achæan culinary resources was as exhaustive as the menu of a Guildhall
5179,HOMERIC MEALS.,dinner. For where would be the ‘swiftness’ of a narrative which could
5180,HOMERIC MEALS.,not leave so much as a dish of beans to the imagination? Homeric
5181,HOMERIC MEALS.,criticism is indeed everywhere complicated by the necessity of admitting
5182,HOMERIC MEALS.,"wide gaps of silence; and in this particular department, so much"
5183,HOMERIC MEALS.,"evidently remains in those gaps, that our list of comestibles must be to"
5184,HOMERIC MEALS.,a great extent inferential.
5185,HOMERIC MEALS.,
5186,HOMERIC MEALS.,‘Butcher’s meat’ (as we call it) was the staple food of Greek heroes.
5187,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Oxen, however, were not recklessly slaughtered. ‘Great meals of beef’"
5188,HOMERIC MEALS.,"usually honoured solemn occasions. The fat beasts, reckoned to be in"
5189,HOMERIC MEALS.,"their prime at five years old, met their fate for the most part in"
5190,HOMERIC MEALS.,"connexion with some expiatory ceremony, as that employed to stay the"
5191,HOMERIC MEALS.,"pestilence in the First Iliad, or as the sacrifice for victory offered"
5192,HOMERIC MEALS.,by Agamemnon in the Second Iliad. The gods were then served first with
5193,HOMERIC MEALS.,"tit-bits wrapped in fat, and reduced by fire to ashes and steamy odours,"
5194,HOMERIC MEALS.,peculiarly grateful to immortal nostrils. Portions of the haunches were
5195,HOMERIC MEALS.,often chosen for this purpose; the tongue might be added; while at other
5196,HOMERIC MEALS.,"times, samples of the whole carcass at large seemed preferable. What"
5197,HOMERIC MEALS.,remained was cut up into small pieces after a fashion still prevailing
5198,HOMERIC MEALS.,"in Albania,[241] and these, having been filed upon spits, were rapidly"
5199,HOMERIC MEALS.,"grilled. Thickly strewn with barley-meal, they were then distributed by"
5200,HOMERIC MEALS.,"a steward, and eaten with utensils of nature’s providing. Specially"
5201,HOMERIC MEALS.,honoured guests had pieces from the chine—‘_perpetui tergo
5202,HOMERIC MEALS.,"bovis_’—allotted to them; and they might, if they chose, share their"
5203,HOMERIC MEALS.,‘booty’ (so it was designated) with any other to whom they desired to
5204,HOMERIC MEALS.,"pass on the compliment, as Odysseus did to Demodocus at the Phæacian"
5205,HOMERIC MEALS.,feast. The glad recipients of these greasy favours were obviously exempt
5206,HOMERIC MEALS.,from modern fastidiousness.

5211,HOMERIC MEALS.,
5212,HOMERIC MEALS.,Sheep and goats were prepared for table precisely in the same way with
5213,HOMERIC MEALS.,"oxen, and so likewise were pigs, save that they were not divested of"
5214,HOMERIC MEALS.,"their skins. ‘Cracklings’ were already appreciated. Roast pork appears,"
5215,HOMERIC MEALS.,"in the Iliad, only on the hospitable board of Achilles; but is less"
5216,HOMERIC MEALS.,exclusively apportioned in the Odyssey. A brace of sucking-pigs were
5217,HOMERIC MEALS.,"instantly killed and cooked by Eumæus, the swineherd of Odysseus, on the"
5218,HOMERIC MEALS.,arrival of his disguised master. Yet he was very far from estimating at
5219,HOMERIC MEALS.,their true value the tender merits of the dish celebrated by Elia as
5220,HOMERIC MEALS.,"perfectly ‘satisfactory to the criticalness of the censorious palate,’"
5221,HOMERIC MEALS.,"actually apologising for it as ‘servants’ fare,’ wholly unacceptable to"
5222,HOMERIC MEALS.,"the haughty Suitors, for whose profuse entertainment a full-grown porker"
5223,HOMERIC MEALS.,"had to be daily sacrificed. Each man, however, despatched his pig, and"
5224,HOMERIC MEALS.,"was shortly ready for more. And so captivated was Eumæus, by the time"
5225,HOMERIC MEALS.,"his four underlings returned from the fields for supper, with his"
5226,HOMERIC MEALS.,"outwardly sorry guest, that, enlarging the bounds of his liberality, he"
5227,HOMERIC MEALS.,"ordered the slaughter of a noble hog, whose adipose perfections had been"
5228,HOMERIC MEALS.,ripening during full five years of life. His cooking was promptly
5229,HOMERIC MEALS.,"executed, and one share having been set aside for the local nymphs, the"
5230,HOMERIC MEALS.,"six men fell to, and left only such scraps as served for an early"
5231,HOMERIC MEALS.,breakfast next morning. The performance would have been creditable in
5232,HOMERIC MEALS.,modern Somaliland.
5233,HOMERIC MEALS.,
5234,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Every Homeric hero was an accomplished butcher, and no despicable cook."
5235,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Both offices were, indeed, too closely connected with religious ritual"
5236,HOMERIC MEALS.,"to have any note of degradation attached to them. Thus, animals were"
5237,HOMERIC MEALS.,"habitually understood to be ‘sacrificed,’ not killed in the purely"
5238,HOMERIC MEALS.,"carnal sense, and the preparation of their flesh for table was"
5239,HOMERIC MEALS.,formalised as part of the ceremony of worship. The Suitors were marked
5240,HOMERIC MEALS.,out as a reckless and impious crew by discarding all sacerdotal
5241,HOMERIC MEALS.,functions from their meal-time operations; yet they reserved to
5242,HOMERIC MEALS.,"themselves, as if it belonged to their superior station, the pleasing"
5243,HOMERIC MEALS.,"duty of cutting the throats of the beasts they were about to devour,"
5244,HOMERIC MEALS.,passing with the least possible delay from the shambles to the
5245,HOMERIC MEALS.,banqueting-hall.
5246,HOMERIC MEALS.,
5247,HOMERIC MEALS.,Homeric culinary art perhaps really covered a wider range than is
5248,HOMERIC MEALS.,"attributed to it in the Poems, where it is designedly represented under"
5249,HOMERIC MEALS.,"a quasi-ritualistic aspect. Although meat, for instance, so far as can"
5250,HOMERIC MEALS.,"be learned from direct statement, was invariably roast or grilled, it by"
5251,HOMERIC MEALS.,no means follows that it was never eaten boiled or stewed. The contrary
5252,HOMERIC MEALS.,inference is indeed fairly warranted by the frequent conjunction of
5253,HOMERIC MEALS.,"pots, water, and fire; and was thought by Athenæus to derive support"
5254,HOMERIC MEALS.,"from the use as a missile, aimed at Odysseus in unprovoked savagery by"
5255,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Ctesippus, one of the Suitors, of an ox’s foot, which happened to be"
5256,HOMERIC MEALS.,"lying conveniently at hand in a bread-basket.[242] For who, asked the"
5257,HOMERIC MEALS.,"gastronomical sophist, ever thought of roasting an ox’s foot?[243] The"
5258,HOMERIC MEALS.,"casual display, too, in a simile of the Iliad, of a caldron of boiling"
5259,HOMERIC MEALS.,"lard,[244] assures us that some kind of frying process was familiar to"
5260,HOMERIC MEALS.,the poet.

5275,HOMERIC MEALS.,"sausage-like composition, of so irredeemably coarse a character, that"
5276,HOMERIC MEALS.,‘ears polite’ cannot fail to be offended at its literal description. It
5277,HOMERIC MEALS.,"consisted, to speak plainly, of the stomach or intestines of a goat,"
5278,HOMERIC MEALS.,"stuffed with blood and fat, and kept revolving before a hot fire until"
5279,HOMERIC MEALS.,"thoroughly done. The Suitors, of noble lineage though they were,"

5283,HOMERIC MEALS.,No quality of game is known to have been rejected through prejudice or
5284,HOMERIC MEALS.,superstition by the Homeric Greeks. But even venison ranked in the
5285,HOMERIC MEALS.,"second line after beef, mutton, and pork. It was sheer hunger that made"
5286,HOMERIC MEALS.,the ‘sequestered stag’ brought down by Odysseus in Ææa a real godsend to
5287,HOMERIC MEALS.,"his disconsolate crew; and hunger again reduced them, in the island of"
5288,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Thrinakie, to the necessity of supporting life with fish and birds, both"
5289,HOMERIC MEALS.,kinds of prey equally being taken by means of baited hooks.[245] But
5290,HOMERIC MEALS.,they set about their capture only when the exhaustion of the ship’s
5291,HOMERIC MEALS.,store of flour and wine warned them to bestir themselves; and the
5292,HOMERIC MEALS.,"regimen their ingenuity provided was so distasteful, and fell so little"
5293,HOMERIC MEALS.,"short, in their opinion and sensations, of absolute starvation, that the"
5294,HOMERIC MEALS.,fatal temptation to seek criminal relief at the expense of the oxen of
5295,HOMERIC MEALS.,"the Sun, proved irresistible. They succumbed to it, and perished."

5302,HOMERIC MEALS.,"The snaring of pigeons and fieldfares is alluded to in the Odyssey,[246]"
5303,HOMERIC MEALS.,"and was practised, we may be sure, in the interests of the appetite. Nor"
5304,HOMERIC MEALS.,can we suppose that Penelope and the ‘divine Helen’ entirely abstained
5305,HOMERIC MEALS.,"from tasting the geese reared by them, although curiosity and amusement"
5306,HOMERIC MEALS.,may have been the chief motives for the care bestowed upon them. Poultry
5307,HOMERIC MEALS.,"of other kinds, as we have seen in another chapter, there was none. But"
5308,HOMERIC MEALS.,"hares must have been used for food, since, like roebucks and wild goats,"
5309,HOMERIC MEALS.,"they were hunted with dogs,[247] certainly not for the mere sake of"
5310,HOMERIC MEALS.,"sport. As regards boars, the case stands somewhat differently. For their"
5311,HOMERIC MEALS.,destructiveness imposed their slaughter as a necessity. The subsequent
5312,HOMERIC MEALS.,consumption of their flesh is left to conjecture. The remains of the
5313,HOMERIC MEALS.,Calydonian brute seem to have been contended for rather through
5314,HOMERIC MEALS.,"arrogance than through appetite, Meleager and the sons of Thestius"
5315,HOMERIC MEALS.,standing forth as the champions of antagonistic claims to the trophies
5316,HOMERIC MEALS.,of the chace. That the boar sacrificed in attestation of the oath of
5317,HOMERIC MEALS.,Agamemnon in the Nineteenth Iliad was afterwards flung by Talthybius far
5318,HOMERIC MEALS.,"into the sea to be ‘food for fishes,’ is without significance on the"
5319,HOMERIC MEALS.,point of edibility. Victims thus immolated never furnished the material
5320,HOMERIC MEALS.,"for feasts; they belonged to the subterranean powers, and fell under the"
5321,HOMERIC MEALS.,shadow of their inauspicious influence.

5331,HOMERIC MEALS.,The fish-eating tastes of the Greeks were of comparatively late
5332,HOMERIC MEALS.,development. Homeric prepossessions were decidedly against ‘fins and
5333,HOMERIC MEALS.,shining scales’ of every variety. Eels were ranked apart. Etymological
5334,HOMERIC MEALS.,evidence shows them to have been primitively classified with
5335,HOMERIC MEALS.,"serpents,[248] and they appeared, from this point of view, not merely"
5336,HOMERIC MEALS.,"unacceptable, but absolutely inadmissible, as food. The resemblance was"
5337,HOMERIC MEALS.,"thus protective, not by the design of nature, but through the"
5338,HOMERIC MEALS.,"misapprehension of man, and the ingenuity of hunger was diverted from"
5339,HOMERIC MEALS.,seeming watersnakes to less repulsive prey. This was found in the
5340,HOMERIC MEALS.,"silvery shoals and ‘fry innumerable’ inhabiting the same element, but"
5341,HOMERIC MEALS.,"differentiated from their congeners by the more obvious possession, and"
5342,HOMERIC MEALS.,"more active use of fins. The Homeric fishermen, however, were not"
5343,HOMERIC MEALS.,enthusiastic in their vocation. Its meditative pleasures made no appeal
5344,HOMERIC MEALS.,"to them, and they were very sensible of the unsatisfied gastronomic"
5345,HOMERIC MEALS.,cravings which survived the utmost success in its pursuit. Nets or hooks
5346,HOMERIC MEALS.,were employed as occasion required. A heavy haul from the deep is
5347,HOMERIC MEALS.,recalled by the gruesome spectacle of the piled-up corpses in the
5348,HOMERIC MEALS.,banqueting-hall at Ithaca.

5426,HOMERIC MEALS.,Homeric seafarers did not resort to fishing as a means of diversifying

5428,HOMERIC MEALS.,"got out their hooks and lines when famine was at hand, and never"
5429,HOMERIC MEALS.,"otherwise. Menelaus accordingly, recounting the story of his detention"
5430,HOMERIC MEALS.,"at Pharos, vivified the impression of his own distress, and the hunger"
5431,HOMERIC MEALS.,"of his men, by the mention of the piscatorial pursuits they were reduced"
5432,HOMERIC MEALS.,"to.[255] And Odysseus, in his narrative to Alcinous, similarly"
5433,HOMERIC MEALS.,"emphasised a similar experience. Fishermen by profession, it can hence"
5434,HOMERIC MEALS.,"be inferred, belonged to the poorest and rudest of the community. Among"
5435,HOMERIC MEALS.,"them were to be found divers for oysters. Patroclus, mocking the fall of"

5464,HOMERIC MEALS.,salt or otherwise as a resource against future need. The distribution of
5465,HOMERIC MEALS.,"superfluity was not better understood in time than in space. Meat, as we"
5466,HOMERIC MEALS.,"have seen, was killed and eaten on the spot; and the husbanding of"
5467,HOMERIC MEALS.,"fish-supplies was still less likely to be thought of. Salt was, however,"
5468,HOMERIC MEALS.,"regularly used as a condiment; it was sprinkled over roast meat,[258]"
5469,HOMERIC MEALS.,and a pinch of salt was a proverbial expression for the indivisible
5470,HOMERIC MEALS.,"atom, so to speak, of charity.[259] Only the marine stores of the"
5471,HOMERIC MEALS.,commodity were drawn upon; those concealed by the earth remained
5472,HOMERIC MEALS.,unexplored—a circumstance in itself marking the great antiquity of the
5473,HOMERIC MEALS.,poems; and it was accordingly regarded as characteristic of an inland
5474,HOMERIC MEALS.,people to eat no salt with their food.[260] Its efficacy for ritual
5475,HOMERIC MEALS.,purification was fully recognised; and the ceremonial of sacrifice
5476,HOMERIC MEALS.,probably involved some use of it; but this is not fully

5495,HOMERIC MEALS.,"The farinaceous part of Homeric diet was furnished, according to"
5496,HOMERIC MEALS.,"circumstances, either by barley-meal, or by wheaten flour. The former"
5497,HOMERIC MEALS.,was lauded as the ‘marrow of men’; ship-stores consisted mainly of it;
5498,HOMERIC MEALS.,"and it was probably eaten boiled with water into a kind of porridge,"
5499,HOMERIC MEALS.,"corresponding perhaps by its prominence in Achæan rustic economy, to the"
5500,HOMERIC MEALS.,_polenta_ of the Lombard peasantry. Barley is called by Pliny ‘the most
5501,HOMERIC MEALS.,"antique form of food,’ and its antiquity lent it sacredness. Hence the"
5502,HOMERIC MEALS.,"preliminary sprinkling with barley-groats, alike of the victim, and of"
5503,HOMERIC MEALS.,the altar upon which it was about to be sacrificed. So essential to the
5504,HOMERIC MEALS.,"validity of the offering was this part of the ceremony, that the guilty"
5505,HOMERIC MEALS.,"comrades of Odysseus, in default of barley, had recourse to shred"
5506,HOMERIC MEALS.,"oakleaves, in their futile attempt at bribing the immortal gods with a"
5507,HOMERIC MEALS.,"share of the spoil, to condone their transgression against the solar"
5508,HOMERIC MEALS.,herds.
5509,HOMERIC MEALS.,
5510,HOMERIC MEALS.,"The favourite Homeric epithet for barley was ‘white,’ and the quality of"
5511,HOMERIC MEALS.,"whiteness is also conveyed by the name, _alphiton_, of barley-meal.[262]"
5512,HOMERIC MEALS.,"But our word ‘wheat’ has the same meaning, while the Homeric _puros_ was"
5513,HOMERIC MEALS.,a yellow grain.[263] Nor can there be much doubt that it was a different
5514,HOMERIC MEALS.,"variety, identical, presumably, with the small, otherwise unknown kind"
5515,HOMERIC MEALS.,"unearthed at Hissarlik. As the finest cereal then extant, its repute"
5516,HOMERIC MEALS.,nevertheless stood high; its taste was called ‘honey-sweet’; its
5517,HOMERIC MEALS.,consumption was plainly a privilege of the well-to-do classes. Our poet
5518,HOMERIC MEALS.,is not likely to have ‘spoken by the card’ when he included wheat among
5519,HOMERIC MEALS.,the spontaneous products of the island of the Cyclops; yet the assertion
5520,HOMERIC MEALS.,"of its indigenous growth there was repeated by Diodorus Siculus,[264]"
5521,HOMERIC MEALS.,"who had better opportunities for knowing the truth, and had taken out no"
5522,HOMERIC MEALS.,official licence for its embellishment. Nevertheless there is much
5523,HOMERIC MEALS.,difficulty in believing that wheat had its native home elsewhere than in
5524,HOMERIC MEALS.,Mesopotamia and Western India.

5588,HOMERIC MEALS.,"been either rice or millet, since spelt does not thrive in hot"
5589,HOMERIC MEALS.,"countries.[270] Millet, too, which was unknown in primitive Greece, was"
5590,HOMERIC MEALS.,"specially favoured by Celts, Iberians, and other tribes.[271] It was"

5595,HOMERIC MEALS.,"non-æsthetic, hence a probable, motive for the cultivation of the poppy"

5626,HOMERIC MEALS.,species only is expressly apportioned for heroic consumption. Nestor and
5627,HOMERIC MEALS.,Machaon were avowedly guilty of eating onions as a relish with
5628,HOMERIC MEALS.,wine.[275] Some degree of refinement has indeed been vindicated for
5629,HOMERIC MEALS.,their tastes on the plea that the Oriental onion is of infinitely
5630,HOMERIC MEALS.,superior delicacy to our objectionable bulb; but we scarcely wrong the
5631,HOMERIC MEALS.,Pylian sage by admitting the likelihood of his preference for the
5632,HOMERIC MEALS.,stronger flavour; nor can we raise high the gustatory standard according
5633,HOMERIC MEALS.,to which wine compounded with goats’ cheese and honey was esteemed the
5634,HOMERIC MEALS.,"most refreshing and delightful of drinks. The same root, moreover, in"
5635,HOMERIC MEALS.,"its crudest form, seems to have recommended itself to refined Phæacian"
5636,HOMERIC MEALS.,"palates. There is persuasive, if indirect evidence, that ‘the rank and"
5637,HOMERIC MEALS.,guilty garlic’ was privileged to flourish in the sunny gardens of
5638,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Alcinous.[276] Socrates, indeed, eulogised the onion, whereas Plutarch"
5639,HOMERIC MEALS.,"contemned it as vulgar, and Horace did not willingly permit onion-eaters"
5640,HOMERIC MEALS.,to come ‘between the wind and his nobility.’ The company of Nestor would
5641,HOMERIC MEALS.,"not, then, have been agreeable to him."

5652,HOMERIC MEALS.,in the Iliad. The following simile explains itself:
5653,HOMERIC MEALS.,
5654,HOMERIC MEALS.,As from the spreading fan leap out the peas
5655,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Or swarthy beans o’er all the spacious floor,"

5660,HOMERIC MEALS.,Here there is evidently no thought of green vegetables. The elastic and
5661,HOMERIC MEALS.,agile pellets cleansed by winnowing were fully ripe. They can be
5662,HOMERIC MEALS.,"identified as chick-peas and broad-beans—species, both of them,"
5663,HOMERIC MEALS.,abundantly produced in modern Greece. The former even retain in Crete
5664,HOMERIC MEALS.,"their Homeric name of _erebinthoi_, ground down, however, by phonetic"
5665,HOMERIC MEALS.,"decay to _rebithi_.[278] They afforded, under the designation ‘_frictum"
5666,HOMERIC MEALS.,"cicer_,’ a staple article of food to the poorer inhabitants of Latium;"
5667,HOMERIC MEALS.,"and, as the Spanish _garbanzo_, they derive culinary importance from the"
5668,HOMERIC MEALS.,part assigned to them in every properly constituted _olla podrida_.[279]
5669,HOMERIC MEALS.,Beans were the first pod-fruit cultivated. They are mentioned in the
5670,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Bible, and have been excavated at Hissarlik. Some pea-like grains,"
5671,HOMERIC MEALS.,"however, found in the same spot, proved on examination to be"
5672,HOMERIC MEALS.,"lentils.[280] These, too, were presumably in common use when Homer"
5673,HOMERIC MEALS.,"lived, as they certainly were some centuries later, yet he makes no"
5674,HOMERIC MEALS.,"allusion to them. More significant, possibly, is his silence on the"
5675,HOMERIC MEALS.,subject of chestnuts. Although the tree covers wide tracts of modern
5676,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Greece, it is held by some eminent authorities to have been introduced"
5677,HOMERIC MEALS.,there from Pontic Asia Minor at a comparatively late period.[281] And
5678,HOMERIC MEALS.,the fact that the rural wisdom of Hesiod completely ignores the chestnut
5679,HOMERIC MEALS.,certainly inclines the balance towards the opinion of its arrival
5680,HOMERIC MEALS.,subsequent to the composition of the ‘Works and Days.’

5766,HOMERIC MEALS.,the author doubtless having made its acquaintance somewhere on the

5768,HOMERIC MEALS.,Phrygia. For Phrygia was in those days more renowned for its figs than
5769,HOMERIC MEALS.,Attica became later. Those of Paros were celebrated by Archilochus about
5770,HOMERIC MEALS.,"700 B.C.;[285] but none, it would seem, were produced on the mainland of"
5771,HOMERIC MEALS.,Greece when Hesiod’s homely experiences took metrical form at
5772,HOMERIC MEALS.,Orchomenus. The ripe figs contributed by his garden to the frugal
5773,HOMERIC MEALS.,repasts of Laertes were then an anachronism to the full as glaring as
5774,HOMERIC MEALS.,"turkeys in England, when Falstaff and Poins took purses ‘as in a castle,"

5784,HOMERIC MEALS.,The pastoral section of the Achæan people drew their subsistence
5785,HOMERIC MEALS.,"immediately, and almost exclusively from their flocks and herds. The"
5786,HOMERIC MEALS.,"commodities directly at hand were supplemented to a very slight extent,"
5787,HOMERIC MEALS.,"if at all, through the secondary channels of sale or barter. Milk and"
5788,HOMERIC MEALS.,"cheese hence formed the staple of their food, and were mainly the"
5789,HOMERIC MEALS.,produce of sheep and goats. Cow’s milk never found favour in Greece;
5790,HOMERIC MEALS.,Homer ignored the possibility of its use; Aristotle depreciated its
5791,HOMERIC MEALS.,quality; and it is now no more thought of as an article of consumption
5792,HOMERIC MEALS.,than ewe’s milk in Great Britain or Ireland.[286] Those early herdsmen
5793,HOMERIC MEALS.,"differed from us, too, in liking their simple beverage well watered. The"
5794,HOMERIC MEALS.,part played occasionally by the pump in our London milk-supply would
5795,HOMERIC MEALS.,"have met with their full approbation—unless, indeed, they might have"
5796,HOMERIC MEALS.,preferred to add the qualifying ingredient at their own discretion. But
5797,HOMERIC MEALS.,"the native strength of milk was, at any rate, too much for them. Only"
5798,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Polyphemus, a giant and a glutton, was voracious enough to swallow the"
5799,HOMERIC MEALS.,"undiluted contents of his pails. To him, as to his curious visitors from"
5800,HOMERIC MEALS.,"over the sea, butter-making was an unknown art, cheese being the sole"
5801,HOMERIC MEALS.,modified product of Homeric dairies. That the first step towards its
5802,HOMERIC MEALS.,preparation consisted in the curdling of fresh milk with the sap of the
5803,HOMERIC MEALS.,"fig-tree, we learn from the following allusion:"
5804,HOMERIC MEALS.,
5805,HOMERIC MEALS.,Soon as liquid milk
5806,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Is curdled by the fig-tree’s juice, and turns"

5822,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Although the keeping of bees was strange to Homer’s experience, the"
5823,HOMERIC MEALS.,product of their industry was pleasantly familiar to him. The ideal of
5824,HOMERIC MEALS.,"deliciousness was furnished by honey, and Homeric palates reached their"
5825,HOMERIC MEALS.,acme of gratification with things ‘honey-sweet.’ But Homeric bees were
5826,HOMERIC MEALS.,"still in a state of nature, their ‘roofs of gold’ getting built in"
5827,HOMERIC MEALS.,hollow trees or rocky clefts. Artificial dwellings were provided for
5828,HOMERIC MEALS.,"them, by interested human agency, considerably later. The use of"
5829,HOMERIC MEALS.,bee-hives in Greece is first attested in the Hesiodic Theogony; and in
5830,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Russia and Lithuania, wild honey was still gathered in the woods little"
5831,HOMERIC MEALS.,"more than a century and a half ago.[288] Alike in the Iliad and Odyssey,"
5832,HOMERIC MEALS.,honey figures in a manner totally inconsistent with our notions of
5833,HOMERIC MEALS.,"gastronomic harmony. We, in our unregenerate condition, should seek to"
5834,HOMERIC MEALS.,"be excused from partaking of the semi-ambrosial diet of cheese, honey,"
5835,HOMERIC MEALS.,and sweet wine supplied by Aphrodite to the divinely brought-up
5836,HOMERIC MEALS.,daughters of Pandareus;[289] nor do we envy to ‘Gerenian Nestor’ and his
5837,HOMERIC MEALS.,wounded companion the posset brewed for them on their return from the
5838,HOMERIC MEALS.,battle-field by the skilful Hecamede. The palates indeed must have been
5839,HOMERIC MEALS.,"hardy, and the constitutions robust, of those upon whom it acted as an"
5840,HOMERIC MEALS.,agreeable restorative. The process of its preparation was as follows. In
5841,HOMERIC MEALS.,a bowl of such noble capacity that an ordinary man’s strength scarcely
5842,HOMERIC MEALS.,"availed to raise it brimming to his lips,"
5843,HOMERIC MEALS.,
5844,HOMERIC MEALS.,Their goddess-like attendant first
5845,HOMERIC MEALS.,A gen’rous measure mixed of Pramnian wine;
5846,HOMERIC MEALS.,Then with a brazen grater shredded o’er
5847,HOMERIC MEALS.,"The goatsmilk cheese, and whitest barley-meal,"
5848,HOMERIC MEALS.,And of the draught compounded bade them drink.[290]
5849,HOMERIC MEALS.,
5850,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Nothing loath, they obeyed, nor did they shrink from adding piquancy to"
5851,HOMERIC MEALS.,the liquid concoction by simultaneously devouring a dozen or so of raw
5852,HOMERIC MEALS.,"onions! A precisely similar drink, designed as a vehicle for the ‘evil"
5853,HOMERIC MEALS.,"drugs’ mingled with it, was treacherously served round by Circe to her"
5854,HOMERIC MEALS.,"guests, and imbibed with the debasing and transforming results one has"
5855,HOMERIC MEALS.,"heard of.[291] Only the onions were absent, and with good reason, the"
5856,HOMERIC MEALS.,crafty sorceress being fully aware of their antidotal power against
5857,HOMERIC MEALS.,malign influences. The practice of sweetening and thickening wine was
5858,HOMERIC MEALS.,handed on from heroic to classic times. Old Thasian especially was
5859,HOMERIC MEALS.,"considered, when tempered with honey and meal, to be of most refreshing"
5860,HOMERIC MEALS.,"quality in the heats of summer; and Athenæus relates, without surprise"
5861,HOMERIC MEALS.,"or disapproval, that the islanders of Thera preferred, for the purpose"
5862,HOMERIC MEALS.,"of making porridge of their wine, ground pease or lentils to"
5863,HOMERIC MEALS.,"barley.[292] The tolerant motto, _De gustibus_, needs now and then, as"

5889,HOMERIC MEALS.,"disposal, was enormous. It could not then be expected that the"
5890,HOMERIC MEALS.,myth-making faculty should remain idle in regard to it. The nectar of
5891,HOMERIC MEALS.,the earth was accordingly believed to drop down from heaven into the
5892,HOMERIC MEALS.,"calyxes of half-opened flowers; it fell from the rising stars, or, at"

5897,HOMERIC MEALS.,"supersensual dainty, had a niche assigned to them in the edifice of"
5898,HOMERIC MEALS.,"fancy. Bees were connected with poetry, music, and eloquence; as"

5900,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Pindar; they were themselves nymphs and priestesses, intertwined more"
5901,HOMERIC MEALS.,especially with the worship of Demeter and Cybele.[294] The germ of some
5902,HOMERIC MEALS.,of these imaginative shoots and sprays seems to be laid bare in the
5903,HOMERIC MEALS.,simple Homeric metaphor by which the discourse of Nestor was said to
5904,HOMERIC MEALS.,flow with more than the sweetness of honey from his lips.[295] The same
5905,HOMERIC MEALS.,idea—a very obvious one—is embodied in the English word _mellifluous_.

5945,HOMERIC MEALS.,quickly and completely discarded on the introduction of vine-culture.
5946,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Floating reminiscences of its primitive use, however, were preserved by"
5947,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Plutarch and Aristotle,[298] and survived unconsciously in the tolerably"
5948,HOMERIC MEALS.,"frequent substitution, by Homer, of the word ‘mead,’ under the form"
5949,HOMERIC MEALS.,"μέθυ, for ‘wine.’ The survival was indeed linguistic only. No mental"
5950,HOMERIC MEALS.,association with honey clung to the term ‘mead.’ The fermented juice of
5951,HOMERIC MEALS.,"the grape is the sole Homeric stimulant, and excites a fully"
5952,HOMERIC MEALS.,"corresponding amount of Homeric enthusiasm. From the old epics,"
5953,HOMERIC MEALS.,"accordingly, Pindaric praises of water are wholly absent. The crystal"
5954,HOMERIC MEALS.,spring occupies in them a strictly subordinate place. The merits allowed
5955,HOMERIC MEALS.,"to it are purely relative. That is to say, it exercises, like the"
5956,HOMERIC MEALS.,"nitrogen of our atmosphere, a qualifying function. The exuberant energy"
5957,HOMERIC MEALS.,"of a more fiery element is modified by its innocuous presence, and it"
5958,HOMERIC MEALS.,helps to neutralise some of the heady virtue inherent in the ‘subtle
5959,HOMERIC MEALS.,blood of the grape.’

5965,HOMERIC MEALS.,A draught of clear water was a luxury unappreciated by the early Greeks.
5966,HOMERIC MEALS.,"On the other hand, they freely watered their wine, counting its full"
5967,HOMERIC MEALS.,strength scarcely less redoubtable than that of raw spirits appears to
5968,HOMERIC MEALS.,ordinary Englishmen. Polyphemus alone drank—in post-Homeric
5969,HOMERIC MEALS.,"phraseology—’like a Scythian’—that is, swallowed his liquor ‘neat’; and"
5970,HOMERIC MEALS.,he plunged thereby into disastrous drunkenness. The wine provided for
5971,HOMERIC MEALS.,"him, it is true, was of unusual and overweening potency. Of Thracian"
5972,HOMERIC MEALS.,"growth, it was supplied to Odysseus by Maron, a priest of Apollo at"
5973,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Ismarus, in grateful acknowledgment of protection afforded during the"
5974,HOMERIC MEALS.,Odyssean sack of the Ciconian metropolis. The secret of its manufacture
5975,HOMERIC MEALS.,was jealously guarded in the Maronian family;[299] its bouquet was
5976,HOMERIC MEALS.,irresistible; its power against sobriety formidable. Even if the
5977,HOMERIC MEALS.,"statement that it required, or at least tolerated, a twenty-fold"
5978,HOMERIC MEALS.,"admixture of water, be taxed as hyperbolical, we can still fall back"
5979,HOMERIC MEALS.,upon Pliny’s assurance that the Maronian wine of his epoch was commonly
5980,HOMERIC MEALS.,diluted with eight measures of water;[300] and the proportion of
5981,HOMERIC MEALS.,twenty-five to one of Thasian wine from the same neighbourhood was
5982,HOMERIC MEALS.,recommended by Hippocrates for invalids.[301]

5996,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Red wines only were quaffed by Homeric heroes. ‘Golden,’ or ‘white’"
5997,HOMERIC MEALS.,kinds were unknown to them; and it may be suspected that the pleasure of
5998,HOMERIC MEALS.,"sharing their potations would have been qualified, to modern"
5999,HOMERIC MEALS.,"connoisseurs, by strong gustatory disapproval. We do not know that the"
6000,HOMERIC MEALS.,practice of using turpentine in the preparation of wine prevailed so
6001,HOMERIC MEALS.,"early, but it was in full force when Plutarch wrote, and it subsisted"
6002,HOMERIC MEALS.,"too long for the comfort of Mr. Dodwell, who warmly protested his"
6003,HOMERIC MEALS.,preference of sour English beer to the resinous wines of Patra and
6004,HOMERIC MEALS.,Libadia.[302] Some of their worst qualities were probably shared by the
6005,HOMERIC MEALS.,"famous ‘Pramnian,’ described by Galen as ‘black and austere.’[303] This"
6006,HOMERIC MEALS.,was the leading component of the draught administered by Hecamede and
6007,HOMERIC MEALS.,Circe; but traditions as to its local origin are obscure and
6008,HOMERIC MEALS.,contradictory. The credit of its production was now assigned to a
6009,HOMERIC MEALS.,"mountain in Caria, now to the Icarian Isle, or to some favoured section"
6010,HOMERIC MEALS.,"of Lesbian territory. Others again held that its distinction resided,"
6011,HOMERIC MEALS.,"not in the place of its growth, but in the method of its manufacture. A"
6012,HOMERIC MEALS.,"particular variety of grape perhaps yielded it; at any rate, Dioscorides"
6013,HOMERIC MEALS.,"says that it was a _prototropum_—that is, a product of the first running"
6014,HOMERIC MEALS.,"of self-expressed juice, making it, among wines, what a proof before"
6015,HOMERIC MEALS.,"letters is among engravings. It took rank, however this might have been,"
6016,HOMERIC MEALS.,"as a choice vintage, meet for the refreshment of heroes, and strictly"
6017,HOMERIC MEALS.,reserved for exceptional use; while the ordinary demand of the army
6018,HOMERIC MEALS.,before Troy was met by the importation of Lemnian and Thracian wines of
6019,HOMERIC MEALS.,"commonplace quality, brought in ships to the shores of the Hellespont,"
6020,HOMERIC MEALS.,"and purchased with the spoils of war—copper and iron, cattle and"
6021,HOMERIC MEALS.,slaves.[304] A night’s carouse might sometimes ensue upon the arrival of
6022,HOMERIC MEALS.,a wine-fleet; but temperance was the rule of old Achæan life. Excess was
6023,HOMERIC MEALS.,"reprobated, and often figured as the cause of misfortune. Thus, the"
6024,HOMERIC MEALS.,"‘Drunken Assembly,’ held immediately after the sack of Troy, was the"
6025,HOMERIC MEALS.,first link in the long chain of disasters incurred by the returning
6026,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Achæans;[305] Elpenor, one of the crew of Odysseus, preceded him to"
6027,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Hades ‘on foot,’ as it is quaintly said, having broken his neck by a"
6028,HOMERIC MEALS.,fall from a roof-top when overcome with wine in the house of Circe; the
6029,HOMERIC MEALS.,ungovernable rage of Achilles could find no more opprobrious epithet
6030,HOMERIC MEALS.,"than ‘wine-laden’ to be hurled, in lieu of a javelin, at Agamemnon; and"
6031,HOMERIC MEALS.,"in Polyphemus, vinous excess assuredly took on its least inviting"
6032,HOMERIC MEALS.,"aspect. The Homeric ideal of life was indeed a festive one, but the"
6033,HOMERIC MEALS.,conviviality it included was kept within the bounds of moderation and
6034,HOMERIC MEALS.,"decorum. Moreover, the pleasures of the table, however keenly"
6035,HOMERIC MEALS.,"appreciated, were redeemed from grossness by the finer touches of social"
6036,HOMERIC MEALS.,sympathy and æsthetic enjoyment. Minstrelsy formed a regular part of a
6037,HOMERIC MEALS.,"well ordered entertainment, and the rhythmical movements of the dance"
6038,HOMERIC MEALS.,"accompanied, on occasions, or alternated with chanted narratives of"
6039,HOMERIC MEALS.,adventure.

6058,HOMERIC MEALS.,"In the palace of Ithaca, guests were served at separate small tables;"
6059,HOMERIC MEALS.,but this may not have been the case everywhere. An erect posture was
6060,HOMERIC MEALS.,maintained by them. The Roman fashion of reclining at meals came in much
6061,HOMERIC MEALS.,later. An opening formality of ablution was designed for ceremonial
6062,HOMERIC MEALS.,"purification; in the interests of corporeal cleanliness, a repetition of"
6063,HOMERIC MEALS.,"the process after the meal was concluded would have been desirable, but"
6064,HOMERIC MEALS.,"appears to have been neglected. As regards the food-supply, a"
6065,HOMERIC MEALS.,"stewardess, or housekeeper, brought round bread in a basket; a carver"
6066,HOMERIC MEALS.,sliced and distributed the grilled meat; a herald filled the goblets in
6067,HOMERIC MEALS.,orderly succession; and good appetites did the rest. Women habitually
6068,HOMERIC MEALS.,"ate apart. So Penelope sat by, spinning and silent, though feverish with"
6069,HOMERIC MEALS.,"eagerness for news of her absent lord, until Telemachus and Theoclymenus"
6070,HOMERIC MEALS.,had concluded their repast; and Nausicaa supped in retirement while her
6071,HOMERIC MEALS.,father feasted with the Phæacian elders. But the rule of seclusion
6072,HOMERIC MEALS.,"appears to have had no application to nymphs and goddesses. Wine,"
6073,HOMERIC MEALS.,"however, was freely allowed to women and children. Arêtê, the mother of"
6074,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Nausicaa, supplied a goat’s skin full for her pic-nic by the seashore;"
6075,HOMERIC MEALS.,and it was with wine that the tunic of Phœnix was wont to be soiled as
6076,HOMERIC MEALS.,he fed the infant Achilles upon his knee.
6077,HOMERIC MEALS.,
6078,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Three meals a day made the full Homeric complement, reduced,"
6079,HOMERIC MEALS.,"nevertheless, to two under frequently recurring circumstances."
6080,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Breakfast—_ariston_—was not always insisted upon, and we hear only twice"
6081,HOMERIC MEALS.,"of its formal preparation. It consisted ordinarily, there is reason to"
6082,HOMERIC MEALS.,"believe, of nothing more than bread soaked in wine; but Eumæus, who, for"
6083,HOMERIC MEALS.,"all his vigilant husbandry, loved talk and good cheer, offered better"
6084,HOMERIC MEALS.,"fare to his wily, unknown guest. A fire was lit in his hut at dawn; some"
6085,HOMERIC MEALS.,"cold pork, left from supper the night before, got re-broiled, and was"
6086,HOMERIC MEALS.,barely hot when Telemachus made an appearance more welcome than looked
6087,HOMERIC MEALS.,"for, having run the gauntlet of the Suitors’ sea-ambuscade on his return"
6088,HOMERIC MEALS.,from Pylos. Hence a considerable amount of weeping for joy was
6089,HOMERIC MEALS.,"indispensable before they could all three—seeming beggar, prince, and"
6090,HOMERIC MEALS.,swineherd—sit down comfortably to breakfast together.
6091,HOMERIC MEALS.,
6092,HOMERIC MEALS.,"But when life ran out of its accustomed groove, and opportunities for"
6093,HOMERIC MEALS.,"eating became precarious, breakfast and dinner—_ariston_ and"
6094,HOMERIC MEALS.,"_deipnon_—were apt to coalesce. Noon, the regular dinner-hour, might,"
6095,HOMERIC MEALS.,"under such circumstances, be anticipated. Thus, when Telemachus and"
6096,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Pisistratus were setting out from Sparta towards Pylos, Menelaus, who"
6097,HOMERIC MEALS.,"was the soul of hospitality, ordered a _deipnon_ to be hastily got"
6098,HOMERIC MEALS.,"ready, and it had certainly been preceded by no lighter repast. The"
6099,HOMERIC MEALS.,"third Homeric meal—_dorpon_—was taken at, or after sundown. Its status"
6100,HOMERIC MEALS.,fluctuated. Of primary importance to those busily engaged in out-of-door
6101,HOMERIC MEALS.,"occupations, it counted for relatively little with idle folk like the"
6102,HOMERIC MEALS.,"Suitors, whose feasts and diversions might be prolonged, if they so"
6103,HOMERIC MEALS.,"willed it, from dawn to dusk. Supper, on the other hand, was naturally"
6104,HOMERIC MEALS.,the chief meal of soldiers and sailors. ‘Perils will be paid with
6105,HOMERIC MEALS.,"pleasures,’ says Verulam; and when the rage of battle was spent, or the"
6106,HOMERIC MEALS.,"ship brought safely into port, a banquet was spread with every available"
6107,HOMERIC MEALS.,"luxury, and enjoyed to the utmost. At sea, cooking was reduced to a"
6108,HOMERIC MEALS.,"minimum, even to zero, the probability being small that fires were ever"
6109,HOMERIC MEALS.,kindled on shipboard. So that the hardships of long voyages were very
6110,HOMERIC MEALS.,"great, if rarely incurred. When possible, land was made by nightfall,"
6111,HOMERIC MEALS.,"the vessel moored, and the crew disembarked."

6127,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6128,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6129,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,THERE are certain low-lying districts in southern Spain where the
6130,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"branched lily, or king’s spear, blooms in such profusion that whole"
6131,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"acres, seen from a distance towards the end of March, show as if densely"
6132,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,strewn with new-fallen snow. Just such in aspect must have been the
6133,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"abode of the Odyssean dead. There, along boundless asphodel plains,"
6134,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Odysseus watched Orion, a spectral huntsman pursuing spectral game:"
6135,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,there Agamemnon denounced the treachery of Clytemnestra: there Ajax
6136,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,still nursed his wrath at the award of the Argive kings: there Achilles
6137,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"gnawed a shadowy heart in longing, on any terms, for action and the"
6138,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,upper air: thither Hermes conducted the delinquent souls of the suitors
6139,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,of Penelope. A tranquil dwelling-place: where the stagnant air of apathy
6140,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,was stirred only by sighs of inane regret.
6141,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6142,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Homer’s asphodel grows only in the under-world, yet it is no mythical"
6143,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,plant. It can be quite clearly identified with the _Asphodelus
6144,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"ramosus_,[306] now extensively used in Algeria for the manufacture of"
6145,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"alcohol, and cultivated in our gardens for the sake of its tall spikes"
6146,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"of beautiful flowers, pure white within and purple-streaked without"
6147,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,along each of the six petals uniting at the base to form a
6148,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,deeply-indented starry corolla. The continual visits of pilfering bees
6149,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,attest a goodly store of honey; while the perfume spread over the
6150,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,northern shores of the Gulf of Corinth by the abundant growth of
6151,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"asphodel was said to have given their name, in some far-off century, to"

6161,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Introduced into England about 1551, it was succeeded, after forty-five"
6162,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"years, by the yellow asphodel (_Asphodelus luteus_), of which already in"

6164,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Hence Pope’s familiarity with this kind, and his consequent"

6173,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6174,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,In order to explain the lugubrious associations of the branched
6175,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"asphodel, we must go back to an early stage of thought regarding the"
6176,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,condition of the dead.
6177,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6178,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Instinctively man assumes that his existence will, in some form, be"
6179,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"continued beyond the grave. Only a few of the most degraded savages, or"
6180,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"a handful of the most enlightened sceptics, accept death with stolid"
6181,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,indifference as an absolute end. The almost universally prevalent belief
6182,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"is that it is a change, not a close. Humanity, as a whole, never has"
6183,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,admitted and never can apostatise from its innate convictions by
6184,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,admitting that its destiny is mere blank corruption. Apart from the
6185,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"body, however, life can indeed be conceived, but cannot be imagined;"
6186,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,since imagination works only with familiar materials. Recourse was then
6187,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,inevitably had to the expedient of representing the under-world as a
6188,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,shadowy reflection of the upper. Disembodied spirits were supposed to
6189,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"feel the same needs, to cherish the same desires, as when clothed in the"
6190,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,flesh; but they were helpless to supply the first or to gratify the
6191,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,second. Their opulence or misery in their new abode depended solely upon
6192,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,the pitying care of those who survived them. This mode of thinking
6193,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,explains the savage rites of sacrifice attendant upon primitive funeral
6194,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,ceremonies: it converted the tombs of ancient kings into the
6195,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,treasure-houses of modern archæologists; and it suggested a system of
6196,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"commissariat for the dead, traces of which still linger in many parts of"
6197,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,the world.
6198,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6199,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Here we find the clue we are in search of. It is afforded by the simple
6200,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,precautions adopted by unsophisticated people against famine in the
6201,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"realm of death. Amongst the early Greeks, the roots of the branched lily"
6202,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,were a familiar article of diet. The asphodel has even been called the
6203,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"potato of antiquity. It indeed surpassed the potato in fecundity, though"
6204,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"falling far below it in nutritive qualities. Pliny, in his ‘Natural"
6205,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"History,’ states that about eighty tubers, each the size of an average"
6206,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"turnip, were often the produce of a single plant; and the French"
6207,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"botanist Charles de l’Écluse, travelling across Portugal in 1564-5, saw"
6208,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"the plough disclose fully two hundred attached to the same stalk, and"
6209,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"together weighing, he estimated, some fifty pounds. Moreover, the tubers"
6210,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"so plentifully developed are extremely rich in starch and sugar, so that"
6211,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"the poorer sort, who possessed no flocks or herds to supply their table"
6212,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"with fat pork, loins of young oxen, roasted goats’ tripe, or similar"
6213,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"carnal delicacies, were glad to fall back upon the frugal fare of mallow"
6214,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,and asphodel lauded by Hesiod. Theophrastus tells us that the roasted
6215,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"stalk, as well as the seed of the asphodel served for food; but chiefly"
6216,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"its roots, which, bruised up with figs, were in extensive use. Pliny"
6217,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"seems to prefer them cooked in hot ashes, and eaten with salt and oil;"
6218,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,but it may be doubted whether he spoke from personal experience.
6219,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6220,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Their consumption, however, was recommended by the example of"
6221,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Pythagoras, and was said to have helped to lengthen out the fabulous"
6222,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"years of Epimenides. Yet, such illustrious examples notwithstanding, the"
6223,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,degenerate stomachs of more recent times have succeeded ill in
6224,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,accommodating themselves to such spare sustenance. When about the middle
6225,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"of last century the Abate Alberto Fortis was travelling in Dalmatia, he"
6226,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"found inhabitants of the village of Bossiglina, near Traù, so poor as to"
6227,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"be reduced to make their bread of bruised asphodel roots, which proving"
6228,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"but an indifferent staff of life, digestive troubles and general"
6229,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,debility ensued. This is the last recorded experiment of the kind. The
6230,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"needs of the human economy are far better, more widely, and almost as"
6231,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,cheaply subserved by the tuber brought by Raleigh from Virginia. The
6232,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,plant of Persephone is left for Apulian sheep to graze upon.
6233,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6234,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Asphodel roots, accordingly, rank with acorns as a prehistoric, but now"
6235,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"discarded article of human food. They were, it is likely, freely"
6236,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"consumed by the earliest inhabitants of Greece, before the cultivation"
6237,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,of cereals had been introduced from the East. There is little fear of
6238,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,error in assuming that the later Achæan immigrants found them already
6239,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,consecrated by traditional usage to the sustenance of the dead—perhaps
6240,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,because the immemorial antiquity of their dietary employment imparted to
6241,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"them an idea of sacredness; or, possibly, because the slightness of the"
6242,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,nourishment they afforded was judged suitable to the maintenance of the
6243,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"unsubstantial life of ghosts. At any rate, the custom became firmly"
6244,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"established of planting graves with asphodel, with a view to making"
6245,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"provision for their silent and helpless, yet still needy inmates. With"
6246,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"changed associations the custom still exists in Greece, and, very"
6247,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"remarkably, has been found to prevail in Japan, where a species of"
6248,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"asphodel is stated to be cultivated in cemeteries, and placed, blooming"
6249,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"in pots, on grave-stones. We can scarcely doubt that the same train of"
6250,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"thought, here as in Greece, originally prompted its selection for"
6251,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,sepulchral uses. Unquestionably some of the natives of the Congo
6252,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"district plant manioc on the graves of their dead, with no other than a"
6253,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,provisioning design.[307] The same may be said of the cultivation of
6254,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,certain fruit-trees in the burying-grounds of the South Sea Islanders.
6255,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"One of these is the _Cratæva religiosa_, bearing an insipid but eatable"
6256,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"fruit, and held sacred in Otaheite under the name of ‘Purataruru.’ The"
6257,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,_Terminalia glabrosa_ fills (or filled a century ago) an analogous
6258,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"position in the Society Islands. It yields a nut resembling an almond,"
6259,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,doubtless regarded as acceptable to phantasmal palates.

6264,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6265,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,We now see quite clearly why the Homeric shades dwell in meadows of
6266,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"asphodel. These were, in the fundamental conception, their"
6267,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"harvest-fields. From them, in some unexplained subsensual way, the"
6268,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,attenuated nutriment they might require must have been derived. But this
6269,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,primitive idea does not seem to have been explicitly present to the
6270,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"poet’s mind. It had already, before his time, we can infer, been to a"
6271,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,great extent lost sight of. It was enough for him that the plant was
6272,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,popularly associated with the dusky regions out of sight of the sun. He
6273,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"did not stop to ask why, his business being to see, and to sing of what"
6274,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"he saw, not to reason. He accordingly made his Hades to bloom for all"
6275,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"time with the tall white flowers of the king’s spear, and so perpetuated"
6276,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,a connexion he was not concerned to explain.
6277,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6278,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Homer cannot be said to have attained to any real conception of the
6279,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,immortality of the soul. The shade which flitted to subterranean spaces
6280,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"when the breath left the body, resembled an animal principle of life"
6281,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"rather than a true spiritual essence. Disinherited, exiled from its"
6282,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"proper abode, without function, sense, or memory, it survived, a"
6283,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"vaporous image, a mere castaway residuum of what once had been a man."
6284,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Tiresias, the Theban soothsayer, alone, by special privilege of"
6285,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Persephone, retained the use of reason: the rest were vain appearances,"
6286,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,escaping annihilation by a scarcely perceptible distinction. No wonder
6287,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,that life should have been darkened by the prospect of such a destiny—or
6288,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"worse. For there were, in the Homeric world to come, awful possibilities"
6289,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"of torment, though none—for the common herd—of blessedness. Deep down in"
6290,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Tartarus, those who had sinned against the gods—Sisyphus, Ixion,"
6291,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Tantalus—were condemned to tremendous, because unending, punishment;"
6292,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"while the haunting sense of loss, which seems to have survived every"
6293,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"other form of consciousness, giving no rest, nor so much as exemption"
6294,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"from fear, pursued good and bad alike. Nowhere does the utter need of"
6295,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,mankind for the hope brought by Christianity appear with such startling
6296,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"clearness as in the verses of Homer, from the contrast of the vivid"
6297,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,pictures of life they present with the appalling background of despair
6298,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,upon which they are painted.
6299,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6300,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Its relation to the unseen world naturally brought to the asphodel a
6301,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,host of occult or imaginary qualities. Of true medicinal properties it
6302,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"may be said to be devoid, and it accordingly finds no place in the"
6303,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"modern pharmacopœia. Anciently, however, it was known, from its manifold"
6304,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"powers, as the ‘heroic’ herb. It was sovereign against witchcraft, and"
6305,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,was planted outside the gates of villas and farmhouses to ward off
6306,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,malefic influences. It restored the wasted strength of the consumptive:
6307,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,it was an antidote to the venom of serpents and scorpions: it entered as
6308,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"an ingredient into love-potions, and was invincible by evil spirits:"
6309,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"children round whose necks it was hung cut their teeth without pain, and"
6310,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"the terrors of the night flew from its presence. Briefly, its faculties"
6311,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,were those of (in Zoroastrian phraseology) a ‘smiter of fiends’; yet
6312,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,from it we moderns distil alcohol! Of a truth it has gone over to the
6313,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,enemy.
6314,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6315,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Sweet is moly, but his root is ill,"
6316,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6317,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,wrote Spenser in one of his sonnets. But it may be doubted whether he
6318,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,would have committed himself to this sentiment had he realised that the
6319,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,gift of Hermes was neither more nor less than a clove of garlic.
6320,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6321,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Odysseus approaching the house of Circe in search of his companions
6322,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"(already, as he found out later, transformed into swine), was met on the"
6323,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"road by the crafty son of Maia, and by him forewarned and forearmed"
6324,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"against the wiles of the enchantress. Skilled in drugs as she was, a"
6325,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,more potent herb than any known to her had been procured by the
6326,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"messenger of the gods. ‘Therewith,’ the hero continued in his narrative"
6327,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"to the Phæacian king, ‘the slayer of Argos gave me the plant that he had"
6328,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"plucked from the ground, and he showed me the nature thereof. It was"
6329,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"black at the root, but the flower was like to milk. The gods call it"
6330,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"moly, but it is hard for mortal men to dig; howbeit, with the gods all"
6331,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,things are possible.’ It is thus evident that the Homeric moly is
6332,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"compounded of two elements—a botanical, so to speak, and a mythological."
6333,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,A substratum of fact has received an embellishment of fable. Before the
6334,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"mind’s eye of the poet, when he described the white flowers and black"
6335,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"root of the vegetable snatched from the reluctant earth by Hermes, was a"
6336,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"specific plant, which he chose to associate, or which had already become"
6337,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"associated, with floating legendary lore, widely and anciently diffused"
6338,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,among our race. The identification of that plant has often been
6339,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"attempted, and not unsuccessfully."
6340,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6341,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,The earliest record of such an effort is contained in Theophrastus’s
6342,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,‘History of Plants.’ He there asserts the moly of the Odyssey to have
6343,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"been a kind of garlic (_Allium nigrum_, according to Sprengel), growing"
6344,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"on Mount Cyllene in Arcadia (the birthplace, be it observed, of Hermes),"
6345,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"and of supreme efficacy as an antidote to poisons; but he, unlike Homer,"
6346,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,adds that there is no difficulty in plucking it. We shall see presently
6347,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,that this difficulty was purely mythical. The language of Theophrastus
6348,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,suggests that the association of moly with the Arcadian garlic was
6349,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,traditional in his time; and the tradition has been perpetuated in the
6350,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"modern Greek name, _molyza_, of a member of the same family."
6351,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6352,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"John Gerard in his Herbal, calls moly (of which he enumerates several"
6353,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"species) the ‘Sorcerer’s garlic,’ and describes as follows the"
6354,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Theophrastian, assumed as identical with the epic, kind."
6355,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6356,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Homer’s moly hath very thick leaves, broad toward the bottom,"
6357,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"sharp at the point, and hollowed like a trough or gutter, in the"
6358,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,bosom of which leaves near unto the bottom cometh forth a
6359,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,certain round bulb or ball of a green colour; which being ripe
6360,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"and set in the ground, groweth and becometh a fair plant, such"
6361,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"as is the mother. Among those leaves riseth up a naked, smooth,"
6362,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"thick stalk of two cubits high, as strong as is a small"
6363,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,walking-staff. At the top of the stalk standeth a bundle of fair
6364,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"whitish flowers, dashed over with a wash of purple colour,"
6365,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,smelling like the flowers of onions. When they be ripe there
6366,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,appeareth a black seed wrapt in a white skin or husk.
6367,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6368,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"The root is great and bulbous, covered with a blackish skin on"
6369,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"the outside, and white within, and of the bigness of a great"
6370,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,onion.
6371,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6372,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,So much for the question in its matter-of-fact aspect. We may now look
6373,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,at it from its fabulous side.
6374,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6375,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"And first, it is to be remembered that moly was not a charm, but a"
6376,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"counter-charm. Its powers were defensive, and presupposed an attack. It"
6377,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,was as a shield against the thrust of a spear. Now if any clear notion
6378,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,could be attained regarding the kind of weapon of which it had efficacy
6379,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"thus to blunt the point, we should be perceptibly nearer to its"
6380,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"individualisation. But we are only told that the magic draught of Circe,"
6381,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"the effects of which it had power to neutralise, contained pernicious"
6382,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"drugs. The poet either did not know, or did not care to tell more."
6383,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6384,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"There is, however, a plant round which a crowd of strange beliefs"
6385,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"gathered from the earliest times. This is the _Atropa mandragora_, or"
6386,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"mandrake, probably identical with the _Dudaim_ of Scripture, and called"
6387,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"by classical writers _Circæa_, from its supposed potency in philtres."
6388,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,The rude resemblance of its bifurcated root to the lower half of the
6389,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,human frame started its career as an object of credulity and an
6390,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,instrument of imposture. It was held to be animated with a life
6391,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"transcending the obscure vitality of ordinary vegetable existence, and"
6392,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,occult powers of the most remarkable kind were attributed to it. The
6393,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"little images, formed of the mandrake root, consulted as oracles in"
6394,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Germany under the name of _Alrunen_, and imported with great commercial"
6395,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"success into this country during the reign of Henry VIII., were credited"
6396,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"with the power of multiplying money left in their charge, and generally"
6397,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"of bringing luck to their possessors, especially when their original"
6398,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"seat had been at the foot of a gallows, and their first vesture a"
6399,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"fragment of a winding-sheet. But privilege, as usual, was here also"
6400,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,fraught with peril. The operation of uprooting a mandrake was a critical
6401,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"one, formidable consequences ensuing upon its clumsy or negligent"
6402,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,execution. These could only be averted by a strict observance of forms
6403,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"prescribed by the wisdom of a very high antiquity. According to Pliny,"
6404,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"three circles were to be drawn round the plant with a sword, within"
6405,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"which the digger stood, facing west. This position had to be combined,"
6406,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"as best it might, with an approach from the windward side, upon his"
6407,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,formidable prey. Through the pages of Josephus the device gained its
6408,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"earliest publicity, of employing a dog to receive the death penalty,"
6409,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"attendant, in his belief, on eradication. It was widely adopted, and by"
6410,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,mediæval sagacity fortified with the additional prescriptions that the
6411,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"canine victim should be black without a white hair, that the deed should"
6412,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"be done before dawn on a Friday, and that the ears of the doer should be"
6413,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"carefully stuffed with cotton-wool. For, at the instant of leaving its"
6414,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"parent-earth, a fearful sound, which no mortal might hear and sanely"
6415,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"survive, issued from the uptorn root. This superstition was familiar in"
6416,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,English literature down to the seventeenth century.
6417,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6418,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Thus Suffolk alleging the futility of bad language in apology for the
6419,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,backwardness in its use with which he has just been reproached by the
6420,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"ungentle queen of Henry VI., exclaims,"
6421,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6422,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake’s groan,"
6423,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"I would invent as bitter-searching terms,"
6424,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"As curst, as harsh, and horrible to hear,"
6425,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Deliver’d strongly through my fixed teeth,"
6426,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"With full as many signs of deadly hate,"

6432,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"That living mortals hearing them, run mad."
6433,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,

6435,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,combated by Sir Thomas Browne.

6437,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Mandragora, then, is the most ancient and the most widely famous of all"
6438,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,magic herbs; and the old conjecture is at least a plausible one that
6439,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,from its exclusive possession were derived the evil powers employed to
6440,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,the detriment of her wind-borne guests by the inhospitable daughter of
6441,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Perse.
6442,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6443,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Moly, on the other hand, must be sought for amongst the herbaceous"
6444,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,antidotes of fable. Perhaps the best known of these is the plant
6445,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"repugnant to the fine senses of Horace, and equally abominable to the"
6446,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,nostrils of Elizabethan gallants. The name of garlic in Sanskrit
6447,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,signifies ‘slayer of monsters.’ Juvenal ridiculed the Egyptians for
6448,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,paying it reverence as a divinity.

6454,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"The Eddic valkyr, Sigurdrifa, sang of its unassailable virtue. As a sure"

6457,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,buried under thresholds. It was laid on beds against nightmare: planted
6458,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,on cottage roofs to keep off lightning: it cured the poisoned bites of
6459,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,reptiles: it was eaten to avert the evil effects of digging hellebore;
6460,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"while, in Cuba, immunity from jaundice was secured by wearing, during"
6461,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"thirteen days, a collar consisting of thirteen cloves of garlic, and"
6462,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"throwing it away at a cross-road, without looking behind, at midnight on"
6463,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,the expiration of that term. The occult properties of this savoury root
6464,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"originated, no doubt, as M. Hehn conceives,[308] in its pungent taste"
6465,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,and smell. Substances strongly impressive to the senses are apt to
6466,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,acquire the reputation of being distasteful to ‘spirits of vile sort.’
6467,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Witness sulphur, employed from of old, in ceremonial purification. But"

6475,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"All the magic faculties of garlic, it may be remarked, are directed to"
6476,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"beneficent purposes; whereas those of the mandrake (regarded as an herb,"
6477,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"not as an idol) are purely maleficent. Later folk-lore, however, has not"
6478,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,brought them into direct competition. Each is thought of as supreme in
6479,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,its own line. Only in the Odyssey (on the supposition here adopted) they
6480,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"were permitted to meet, with the result of signal defeat for the powers"
6481,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,of evil.
6482,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6483,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Thus we see that the identification of moly with garlic is countenanced
6484,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"by whatever scraps of botanical evidence are at hand, fortified by a"
6485,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"constant local tradition, no less than by the fantastic prescriptions of"
6486,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"superstitious popular observance. The difficulty or peril of uprooting,"
6487,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,which made the prophylactic plant obtained by Hermes all but
6488,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"unattainable to mortals, is a common feature in vegetable mythology. It"
6489,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"figures as the price to be paid for something rarely precious, enhancing"
6490,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,its value and at the same time affixing a scarcely tolerable penalty to
6491,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"its possession. It belonged, for instance, in varying degrees, to"
6492,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"hellebore and mistletoe, as well as to mandragora. With the last it most"
6493,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"likely originated, and from it was transferred by Homer, in the exercise"

6498,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"passed through them. The leading motive of his character is, in fact,"
6499,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,found in his multiform experience. He is appointed to see and to suffer
6500,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"all that comes within the scope of Greek humanity. No vicissitudes, no"
6501,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,perils are spared him. Protection from the extremity of evil must and
6502,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,does content him. For his keen curiosity falls in with the design of his
6503,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"celestial patroness, in urging him to drink to the dregs the costly"
6504,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,draught of the knowledge of good and evil. Yet it is to be noted that
6505,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,from the house of the enchantress there is no exit save through the

6508,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Within the spacious confines of the universe there is perhaps but one
6509,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,race of beings whose implanted instincts and whose visible destiny are
6510,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,irreconcilably at war. Man is born to suffer; but suffering has always
6511,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,for him the poignancy of surprise. The long record of multiform
6512,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"tribulation which he calls his history, has been moulded, throughout its"
6513,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"many vicissitudes, by a keen and ceaseless struggle for enjoyment. Each"
6514,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,man and woman born into the world looks afresh round the horizon of life
6515,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"for pleasure, and meets instead the ever fresh outrage of pain. Our"
6516,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,planet is peopled with souls disinherited of what they still feel to be
6517,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"an inalienable heritage of happiness. No wonder, then, that"
6518,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,quack-medicines for the cure of the ills of life should always have been
6519,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"popular. Of such nostrums, the famous Homeric drug nepenthes is an early"
6520,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"example, and may serve for a type."
6521,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6522,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,We read in the Odyssey that Telemachus had no sooner reached man’s
6523,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"estate than he set out from Ithaca for Pylos and Lacedæmon, in order to"
6524,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"seek news of his father from Nestor and Menelaus, the two most eminent"
6525,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,survivors of the expedition against Troy. But he learned only that
6526,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Odysseus had vanished from the known world. The disappointment was
6527,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"severe, even to tears, notwithstanding that the banquet was already"

6529,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"including the illustrious host and hostess, caught the infection of"
6530,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"grief, and the pleasures of the table were over-clouded."

6532,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Then Helena the child of Zeus strange things

6556,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Such is the story which has formed the basis of innumerable conjectures.
6557,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,The name of the drug administered by Helen signifies the negation of
6558,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"sorrow; and we learn that it grew in Egypt, and that its administration"
6559,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,was followed by markedly soothing effects. Let us see whither these
6560,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,scanty indications as to its nature will lead us.
6561,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6562,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Many of the ancients believed nepenthes to have been a kind of bugloss,"
6563,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"the leaves of which, infused in wine, were affirmed by Dioscorides,"
6564,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Galen, and other authorities, to produce exhilarating effects. It is"
6565,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,certain that in Plutarch’s time the hilarity of banquets was constantly
6566,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,sought to be increased by this means. But this was done in avowed
6567,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"imitation of Helen’s hospitable expedient. It was, in other words, a"
6568,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"revival, not a survival, and possesses for us, consequently, none of the"
6569,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,instructiveness of an unbroken tradition.
6570,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6571,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"A new idea was struck out by the Roman traveller Pietro della Valle, who"
6572,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,visited Persia and Turkey early in the seventeenth century. He suspected
6573,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"the true nepenthean draught to have been coffee! From Egypt, according"
6574,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"to the antique narrative, it was brought by Helen; and by way of Egypt"
6575,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"the best Mocha reached Constantinople, where it served to recreate the"
6576,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"spirits, and pass the heavy hours, of the subjects of Achmet. Of this"
6577,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"hypothesis we may say, in the phrase of Sir Thomas Browne, that it is"
6578,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"‘false below confute.’ The next, that of honest Petrus la Seine, has"
6579,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,even less to recommend it. His erudite conclusion was that in nepenthes
6580,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"the long-sought _aurum potabile_, the illusory ornament of the"
6581,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Paracelsian pharmacopœia, made its first historical appearance! Egypt,"
6582,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"he argued, was the birthplace of chemistry, and the great chemical"
6583,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,desideratum from the earliest times had been the production of a
6584,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"drinkable solution of the most perfect among metals. Nay, its supreme"
6585,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"worth had lent its true motive to the famous Argonautic expedition,"
6586,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"which had been fitted out for the purpose of securing, not a golden"
6587,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"fleece in the literal sense, but a parchment upon which the invaluable"
6588,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,recipe was inscribed. The virtues of the elixir were regarded by the
6589,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"learned dissertator as superior to proof or discussion, in which exalted"
6590,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,position we willingly leave them.
6591,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6592,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"More enthusiastic than critical, Madame Dacier looked at the subject"
6593,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"from a point of view taken up, many centuries earlier, by Plutarch."
6594,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Nepenthes, according to both these authorities, had no real existence."
6595,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,The effects ascribed to it were merely a figurative way of expressing
6596,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,the charms of Helen’s conversation.
6597,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6598,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,But this was to endow the poet with a subtlety which he was very far
6599,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"from possessing. Simple and direct in thought, he invariably took the"
6600,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,shortest way open to him in expression; and circuitous routes of
6601,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,interpretation will invariably lead astray from his meaning. It is clear
6602,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"accordingly that a real drug, of Egyptian origin, was supposed to have"
6603,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,soothed and restored appetite to the guests of Menelaus—a drug quite
6604,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"possibly known to Homer only by the rumour of its qualities, which he"
6605,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"ingeniously turned to account for the purposes of his story. Now, since"
6606,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"those qualities were undoubtedly narcotic, the field of our choice is a"
6607,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"narrow one. We have only to inquire whether any, and, if so, what,"
6608,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,preparations of the kind were anciently in use by the inhabitants of the
6609,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Nile valley.
6610,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6611,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Unfortunately our information does not go very far back. A certain
6612,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"professor of botany from Padua, however, named Prosper Alpinus, has left"
6613,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,a remarkable account of his personal observations on the point towards
6614,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,the close of the sixteenth century. The vulgar pleasures of intoxication
6615,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,appear to have been (as was fitting in a Mohammedan country) little in
6616,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,request: among all classes their place was taken by the raptures of
6617,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,solacing dreams and delightful visions artificially produced. The means
6618,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,employed for the purpose were threefold. There was first an electuary of
6619,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,unknown composition imported from India called _bernavi_. But this may
6620,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"at once be put aside, since the ‘medicine for a mind diseased’ given by"
6621,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Polydamna to Helen was, as we have seen, derived from a home-grown"
6622,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Egyptian herb. There remain of the three soothing drugs mentioned by
6623,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Alpinus, hemp and opium. Each was extensively consumed; and the practice"
6624,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"of employing each as a road to pleasurable sensations was already, in"
6625,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"1580, of immemorial antiquity. One of them was almost certainly the true"
6626,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,Homeric nepenthes. We have only to decide which.
6627,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6628,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"The first, as being the cheaper form of indulgence, was mainly resorted"
6629,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"to, our Paduan informant tells us, amongst the lower classes. From the"
6630,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,leaves of the herb _Cannabis sativa_ was prepared a powder known as
6631,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"_assis_, made up into boluses and swallowed, with the result of inducing"
6632,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,a lethargic state of dreamy beatitude. _Assis_ was fundamentally the
6633,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"same with the Indian _bhang_, the Arabic _hashish_—one of the mainstays"
6634,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,of Oriental sensual pleasure.
6635,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6636,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,The earliest mention of hemp is by Herodotus. He states that it grew in
6637,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"the country of the Scythians, that from its fibres garments scarcely"
6638,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"distinguishable in texture from linen were woven in Thrace, and that the"
6639,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,fumes from its burning seeds furnished the nomad inhabitants of what is
6640,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"now Southern Russia, with vapour-baths, serving them as a substitute for"
6641,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,washing. Marked intoxicating effects attended this peculiar mode of
6642,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,ablution.
6643,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6644,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"In China, from the beginning of the third century of our era, if not"
6645,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"earlier, a preparation of hemp was used (it was said, with perfect"
6646,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,success) as an anæsthetic; and it is mentioned as a remedy under the
6647,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"name of _b’hanga_, in Hindu medical works of probably still earlier"
6648,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"date. Its identity with nepenthes was first suggested in 1839, and has"
6649,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,since been generally acquiesced in. But there are two objections.
6650,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6651,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"The practice of eating or smoking hemp, for the sake of its exalting"
6652,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"effects upon consciousness, appears to have originated on the slopes of"
6653,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"the Himalayas, to have spread thence to Persia, and to have been"
6654,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"transmitted farther west by Arab agency. It was not, then, primitively"
6655,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"an Egyptian custom, and was assuredly unknown to the wife of Thôn."
6656,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Moreover, hemp is not indigenous on the banks of the Nile. It came"
6657,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"thither as an immigrant, most probably long after the building of the"
6658,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,latest pyramid. Herodotus includes no mention of it in his curious and
6659,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"particular account of the country; and, which is still more significant,"
6660,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,no relic of its textile use survives. Not a hempen fibre has ever been
6661,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,found in any of the innumerable mummy-cases examined by learned
6662,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Europeans. The ancient Egyptians, it may then be concluded, were"
6663,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"unacquainted with this plant, and we must look elsewhere for the chief"
6664,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,ingredient of the comfort-bringing draught distributed by the daughter
6665,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,of Zeus.
6666,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6667,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,There is only opium left. It is legitimately reached by the ‘method of
6668,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"exclusions.’ Should it fail, no substitute can be provided. But it does"
6669,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,not fail. No serious discrepancy starts up to shake our belief that in
6670,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,recognising opium under the disguise of nepenthes we have indeed struck
6671,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,the truth. All the circumstances correspond to admiration: the
6672,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,identification runs ‘on all fours.’ The physical effects indicated agree
6673,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,perfectly with those resulting from a sparing use of opium. They tend to
6674,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,just so much elevation of spirits as would impart a roseate tinge to the
6675,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,landscape of life. The intellect remains unclouded and serene. The
6676,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Nemesis of indulgence, however moderate, is still behind the scenes. The"
6677,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,exhibition of a soporific effect has even been seriously thought to have
6678,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,been designed by the poet in the proposal of Telemachus to retire to
6679,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,rest shortly after the nepenthean cup has gone round; but so bald a
6680,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,piece of realism can scarcely have entered into the contemplation of an
6681,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,artist of such consummate skill.
6682,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,
6683,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"For ages past, Thebes in Egypt has witnessed the production of opium"
6684,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"from the expressed juice of poppyheads. Six centuries ago, the substance"
6685,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"was known in Western Europe as _Opium Thebaïcum_, or the ‘Theban"
6686,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"tincture.’ Prosper Alpinus states that the whole of Egypt was supplied,"
6687,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"at the epoch of his visit, from Sajeth, on the site of the ancient"
6688,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,hundred-gated city. And since a large proportion of the upper classes
6689,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"were undisguised opium-eaters, the demand must have been considerable."
6690,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"Now it was precisely in Thebes that Helen, according to Diodorus,"
6691,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,received the sorrow-soothing drug from her Egyptian hostess; while the
6692,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"women of Thebes, and they only, still in his time preserved the secret"
6693,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,of its qualities and preparation. Can we doubt that the ancient
6694,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,nepenthes was in truth no other than the mediæval Theban tincture? Even
6695,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"stripping from the statement of Diodorus all historical value, its"
6696,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"legendary significance remains. It proves, beyond question, the"
6697,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,existence of a tradition localising the gift of Polydamna in a spot
6698,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"noted, from the date of the earliest authentic information on the"
6699,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"subject, for the production of a modern equivalent. The inference seems"
6700,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,"irresistible that the two were one, and that, as De Quincey said, Homer"
6701,HOMER’S MAGIC HERBS.,is rightly reputed to have known the virtues of opium.

6713,THE METALS IN HOMER.,
6714,THE METALS IN HOMER.,THE undivided Aryans knew very little of the underground riches of the
6715,THE METALS IN HOMER.,earth. They transmitted to their dispersed descendants no common words
6716,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"for mining, forging, or smelting, none to indicate a metal in general,"
6717,THE METALS IN HOMER.,and only one designative of a metal in particular. This took in Sanskrit
6718,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"the form _ayas_, in Latin, _æs_; it is represented by the German _Erz_,"
6719,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"equivalent to the English _ore_; and, after drifting through a Celtic"
6720,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"channel, took a new meaning and form as _Eisen_, or _iron_.[310] The"
6721,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"original signification of the term was _copper_; and copper seems, in"
6722,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"general, to have been the first metal to engage the attention of"
6723,THE METALS IN HOMER.,primitive man. This is easily accounted for. Copper is widely
6724,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"distributed; it frequently occurs in the native state, when its strong"
6725,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"colour at once catches the eye; it is easily worked, and displays a"
6726,THE METALS IN HOMER.,luminous glow highly engaging to an unsophisticated taste for ornament.
6727,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"And, because copper was at first the only substance of the kind known,"
6728,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"its name was used to determine those of other related substances. Thus,"
6729,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"in Sanskrit, iron was called ‘dark blue _ayas_,’ _ayas_ having come to"
6730,THE METALS IN HOMER.,mean metal in general; and a specific sign (possibly that for
6731,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"_hardness_) added, in the Egyptian inscriptions, to the hieroglyph for"
6732,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"copper, causes it to denote iron.[311] But in South Africa these"
6733,THE METALS IN HOMER.,positions are exchanged. There iron ranks as the fundamental metal; gold
6734,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"being known to at least one Kafir tribe as ‘yellow,’ silver as ‘white,’"
6735,THE METALS IN HOMER.,copper as ‘red’ iron.[312] And to these linguistic facts corresponds the
6736,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"exceptional circumstance, due probably to early intercourse with Egypt,"
6737,THE METALS IN HOMER.,that the stone-age in South Africa yielded immediately to an iron-age.

6765,THE METALS IN HOMER.,
6766,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Gold was with Homer supreme among terrestrial substances. It represented
6767,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"to him beauty, splendour, power, wealth, incorruption. It was the metal"
6768,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"of the gods, and mortals by its profuse employment, borrowed something"
6769,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"of divine glory. Its availability for them had, nevertheless, narrow"
6770,THE METALS IN HOMER.,limitations unfelt supernally. For the visionary metal of Olympus might
6771,THE METALS IN HOMER.,be dispensed at will without restrictions either as to quantity or
6772,THE METALS IN HOMER.,qualities. Inexhaustible stores of it lay at command; and it could be
6773,THE METALS IN HOMER.,rendered infrangible and impenetrable by some mythical process unknown
6774,THE METALS IN HOMER.,to sublunary metallurgists. Hence the golden hobbles with which Poseidon
6775,THE METALS IN HOMER.,secured his coursers might have proved less satisfactory for the
6776,THE METALS IN HOMER.,restraint of commonplace Thracian or Thessalian horses; the golden sword
6777,THE METALS IN HOMER.,of Apollo would surely have bent in the hand of Hector; the golden
6778,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"mansion of the sea-god built for aye in the blue depths of the Ægean,"
6779,THE METALS IN HOMER.,could not have supported its own weight for an hour on realistic dry
6780,THE METALS IN HOMER.,land; nor would the process of lifting earth to heaven by hauling on a
6781,THE METALS IN HOMER.,rope have been facilitated by making that rope (as Zeus proposed to do
6782,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"for the purpose in question) of gold. Of gold, too, were the garments of"
6783,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"the gods, their thrones, utensils, implements, appurtenances; the"
6784,THE METALS IN HOMER.,pavement of their courts was ‘trodden gold’; golden were the wings of
6785,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Iris, golden was the beauty of Aphrodite. No doubt, all these"
6786,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"attributions were half consciously metaphorical, but their main design"
6787,THE METALS IN HOMER.,was to set off immortal existence by decorating it with an enhanced
6788,THE METALS IN HOMER.,degree of the same kind of magnificence marking the dignity of mortal
6789,THE METALS IN HOMER.,potentates.
6790,THE METALS IN HOMER.,
6791,THE METALS IN HOMER.,It is remarkable that the Olympian gold in the Shield of Achilles
6792,THE METALS IN HOMER.,retained some part of the occult virtue properly belonging to it only in
6793,THE METALS IN HOMER.,that elevated sphere. Of the five metallic layers composing the great
6794,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"buckler, the middle and most precious one gets the whole credit of"
6795,THE METALS IN HOMER.,having arrested the quivering spears of Æneas and Asteropæus.[314] The
6796,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"verses, to be sure, recording its superior efficacy are held to be"
6797,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"spurious, and the inclusion of a hidden stratum of gold does indeed seem"
6798,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"without reason, as it is certainly without precedent. Yet the original"
6799,THE METALS IN HOMER.,poet would not have altogether disavowed the inspiring idea of the
6800,THE METALS IN HOMER.,passage; and the alleged impenetrability of the gold-mail of
6801,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Masistius[315] may be held to imply that traces of its old mystical
6802,THE METALS IN HOMER.,faculty of resistance lingered about the metal so late as when Xerxes

6823,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"the mythological point of view—an advance, slight yet significant,"
6824,THE METALS IN HOMER.,towards a more spiritualised conception of deity.
6825,THE METALS IN HOMER.,
6826,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Oriental contact first stirred the _auri sacra fames_ in the Greek mind.
6827,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"That this was so the Greek language itself tells plainly. For _chrusos_,"
6828,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"gold, is a Semitic loanword, closely related to the Hebrew _chârûz_, but"
6829,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"taken immediately, there can be no reasonable doubt, from the Phœnician."
6830,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"The restless treasure-seekers from Tyre were, indeed, as the"
6831,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Græco-Semitic term _metal_ intimates,[316] the original subterranean"
6832,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"explorers of the Balkan peninsula. As early, probably, as the fifteenth"
6833,THE METALS IN HOMER.,century B.C. they ‘digged out ribs of gold’ on the islands of Thasos and
6834,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Siphnos, and on the Thracian mainland at Mount Pangæum; and the fables"
6835,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"of the Golden Fleece, and of Arimaspian wars with gold-guarding"
6836,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"griffins, prove the hold won by the ‘precious bane’ over the popular"
6837,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"imagination. Asia Minor was, however, the chief source of prehistoric"
6838,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"supply, the native mines lying long neglected after the Phœnicians had"
6839,THE METALS IN HOMER.,been driven from the scene. Midas was a typical king in a land where the
6840,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"mountains were gold-granulated, and the rivers ran over sands of gold."
6841,THE METALS IN HOMER.,And it was in fact from Phrygia that Pelops was traditionally reported
6842,THE METALS IN HOMER.,to have brought the treasures which made Mycenæ the golden city of the
6843,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Achæan world.

6850,THE METALS IN HOMER.,The Epic affluence in gold was not wholly fictitious. From the

6852,THE METALS IN HOMER.,metal have been disinterred; freely at command even in the lowest

6857,THE METALS IN HOMER.,This plentifulness contrasts strangely with the extreme scarcity of gold
6858,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"in historic Greece. It persisted, however, mainly owing to the vicinity"
6859,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"of the auriferous Ural Mountains, in the Milesian colony of Panticapæum,"
6860,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"near Kertch, where graves have been opened containing corpses shining"

6872,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Accordingly, in some very early Egyptian inscriptions, silver, by"
6873,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"heading the list of metals, claims a supremacy over them which proved"
6874,THE METALS IN HOMER.,short-lived. It terminated for ever with the scarcity that had produced
6875,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"it, when the Phœnicians began to pour the flood of Spanish silver into"
6876,THE METALS IN HOMER.,the markets and treasure-chambers of the East. Armenia constituted
6877,THE METALS IN HOMER.,another tolerably copious source of supply; and it was in this quarter
6878,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"that Homer located the ‘birthplace of silver.’[319] Alybé, on the coast"
6879,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"of the Euxine east of Paphlagonia, whence the Halizonians came to Troy,"
6880,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"was identified by Strabo with Chalybe, a famous mining district.[320]"
6881,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"The people there, indeed, as Xenophon recorded, lived mostly by digging"
6882,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"iron; and their name was preserved in the Greek _chalups_, steel, and"
6883,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"survives with ourselves in _chalybeate_ waters. The district has,"
6884,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"however, in modern times, again become known as argentiferous. The"

6908,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"The word _silver_ (Gothic, _silubr_) has even been conjecturally"
6909,THE METALS IN HOMER.,associated with the Homeric Alybé;[322] while other philologists prefer
6910,THE METALS IN HOMER.,to regard it as equivalent to the Assyrian _sarpu_.[323] All that is
6911,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"certain is the absence of a general Aryan name for the metal, showing"
6912,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"that the Aryans collectively made no acquaintance with it. Thus, the"
6913,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Greek _arguros_ and the Latin _argentum_, although closely related, are"
6914,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"really different words. That is to say, they were formed independently"
6915,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"from the common root, _ark_, to shine, modified into _arg_, white. Its"
6916,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"whiteness, in fact, has supplied the designations of this metal in all"
6917,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"parts of the world. Silver is the ‘white iron’ of the Kaffirs, the"
6918,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"‘white gold’ of the Afghans, the ‘white copper’ of the Vedic Indians;"
6919,THE METALS IN HOMER.,and the antique Accadians and Egyptians defined it by the same obvious

6937,THE METALS IN HOMER.,The subsequence of its invention to the adoption into the Greek language
6938,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"of _chrusos_, gold, can be inferred from the relative paucity of proper"
6939,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"and placenames compounded with it. Homer has only four such, while his"
6940,THE METALS IN HOMER.,‘golden’ appellations number thirteen. Take as specimens the series
6941,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Chryse, Chryses, and Chryseïs, designating a place in the Troad, the"
6942,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"priest of Apollo in that place, and his daughter, all memorably"
6943,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"connected with the tragic Wrath of Achilles. The nomenclature, no doubt,"
6944,THE METALS IN HOMER.,took its rise from solar associations; yet the typical relationship
6945,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"between gold and the sun, silver and the moon, is nowhere in the Epics"
6946,THE METALS IN HOMER.,directly recognised. Helios is never decorated with the epithet
6947,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"‘golden’; Apollo, if he wears a golden sword, is more strongly"
6948,THE METALS IN HOMER.,characterised by his silver bow. Lunar mythology is ignored; nor is the
6949,THE METALS IN HOMER.,ready metaphor of the ‘silver moon’ to be found in Homeric verse. The
6950,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"‘apparent queen’ of the nocturnal sky does not there, as elsewhere in"
6951,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"poetry and folk-lore, ‘throw her silver mantle o’er the dark.’ The"
6952,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"metallic sheen, on the other hand, of water rippling in sunshine,"
6953,THE METALS IN HOMER.,produces its due effect in the generation of epithets; rivers being
6954,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"habitually called ‘silver-eddying,’ and Thetis, the Undine of the Iliad,"
6955,THE METALS IN HOMER.,wearing a specific badge as ‘silver-footed.’
6956,THE METALS IN HOMER.,
6957,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"For the concrete purposes of actual decoration, the metal was in"
6958,THE METALS IN HOMER.,constant Homeric demand. Heré’s chariot and the car of Rhesus shone with
6959,THE METALS IN HOMER.,its delicate radiance; the chair of Penelope was spirally inwrought with
6960,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"silver and ivory; the greaves of Paris were silver clasped, and the"
6961,THE METALS IN HOMER.,sheath of his sword silver-studded; a silver hilt adorned the weapon of
6962,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Achilles, and the strings of his lyre were attached to a silver"
6963,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"yoke.[325] Of silver, too, was the tool-chest of Hephæstus; the guests"
6964,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"of Circe ate off silver tables; the guests of Menelaus, if particularly"
6965,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"favoured, might have bathed in silver tubs, two of which were presented"
6966,THE METALS IN HOMER.,to him in Egypt; and from golden ewers water was poured into silver
6967,THE METALS IN HOMER.,basins for the ablutions before meals in every establishment of some
6968,THE METALS IN HOMER.,pretension. The fittings shared the splendours of the furniture in
6969,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Odyssean palaces. In the great hall of Alcinous, the door-posts and"
6970,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"lintel were of silver, and golden and silver hounds, fashioned by"
6971,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Hephæstus, kept watch beside its golden gates. And the courts of"
6972,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Menelaus were resplendent with gold, bronze, silver, and electrum."

6978,THE METALS IN HOMER.,
6979,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"The term ‘electrum,’ however, is a somewhat ambiguous one. In classical"
6980,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Greek, it denotes two perfectly distinct substances, one metallic, the"
6981,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"other of organic origin—the latter, indeed, chiefly; the word came to be"
6982,THE METALS IN HOMER.,applied almost exclusively to _amber_. Or it may be that two primarily
6983,THE METALS IN HOMER.,distinct words coalesced with time into one. Lepsius has urged the
6984,THE METALS IN HOMER.,probability that the name of the metal was of the masculine form
6985,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"_elektros_, while amber was designated by the neuter _elektron_.[326]"
6986,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Nor is it unlikely that these words had separate genealogies, the first"
6987,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"being derived from an Aryan root signifying ‘to shine,’ the second from"
6988,THE METALS IN HOMER.,a Semitic name for resin. Phœnician inscriptions may eventually throw
6989,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"light upon a point which must otherwise remain unsettled, by acquainting"
6990,THE METALS IN HOMER.,us with the Phœnician mode of designating amber.

6996,THE METALS IN HOMER.,The metallic electrum was an alloy of gold with about twenty per cent.
6997,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"of silver. It occurs naturally, but was produced artificially as well,"
6998,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"especially in Egypt, where _asem_, as it was called, came into favour"
6999,THE METALS IN HOMER.,long before any of the pyramids were built. It was in the Nile valley
7000,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"thought fit for goddesses’ wear, its pale radiance suggesting feminine"
7001,THE METALS IN HOMER.,refinement; and stores of it were laid up in the treasures of all the
7002,THE METALS IN HOMER.,early kings. The first Lydian coinage was of electrum; many of the
7003,THE METALS IN HOMER.,utensils and ornaments discovered at Hissarlik and Mycenæ prove to be
7004,THE METALS IN HOMER.,similarly composed; and electrum continued in favour down to a
7005,THE METALS IN HOMER.,particularly late date in the Græco-Scythic settlements on the Black
7006,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Sea. It made one of its few historical appearances in the ‘white gold’
7007,THE METALS IN HOMER.,offered by Crœsus at Delphi;[327] and there are two instances of its
7008,THE METALS IN HOMER.,epical employment. The ground of the Hesiodic Shield of Hercules was
7009,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"inlaid, the walls of the banqueting-hall of Menelaus were overlaid, with"
7010,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"gold, electrum, and ivory. Although, in two other passages of the"
7011,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Odyssey, the same word undoubtedly designates amber, it is safe to"
7012,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"affirm that here, where mural incrustations are in question, a metallic"
7013,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"substance, none other than the immemorial _asem_ of Egypt, should be"
7014,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"understood. Egyptian analogies, as Lepsius many years ago pointed out,"
7015,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"strongly support this supposition, above all where Egyptian associations"
7016,THE METALS IN HOMER.,are so marked as in the Odyssean description of the Spartan court.
7017,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Electrum is unknown in the Iliad. The word occurs only in the form

7024,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"The third Homeric metal, and the most important of all, is _chalkos_."
7025,THE METALS IN HOMER.,But what does _chalkos_ mean? Copper or bronze? The question is not one
7026,THE METALS IN HOMER.,to be answered off-hand or categorically. It has been long and learnedly
7027,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"debated; and admits, perhaps, of no decision more absolute than the"
7028,THE METALS IN HOMER.,cautious arbitrament of Sir Roger de Coverley.
7029,THE METALS IN HOMER.,
7030,THE METALS IN HOMER.,No help towards clearing up the point in dispute has been derived from
7031,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"etymological inquiries. The word _chalkos_ is without Aryan equivalents,"
7032,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"and can best be explained by means of the Semitic _hhalaq_, signifying"
7033,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"‘metal worked with a hammer.’[328] Its primitive meaning, thus left"
7034,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"conjectural, was most probably ‘copper.’ For, from all parts of Europe,"
7035,THE METALS IN HOMER.,evidence has gradually accumulated that the transition from the use of
7036,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"stone to the use of bronze was through a ‘copper age,’ which, though"
7037,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"perhaps of short duration, has left relics impossible to be ignored."
7038,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Indications are even forthcoming among the prehistoric ‘finds’ at
7039,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Hissarlik, of the tentative processes by which copper was improved into"
7040,THE METALS IN HOMER.,bronze.[329] The lower strata of ruins on the site of ancient Troy
7041,THE METALS IN HOMER.,contained articles and implements of approximately pure copper; nearer
7042,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"the surface, a sensible ingredient of tin was added, augmented, here and"
7043,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"there, to the normal proportion for bronze of about twelve per cent. At"
7044,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Mycenæ, domestic vessels were fabricated of copper, weapons and"
7045,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"ornamental objects of bronze; and a copper saw, dug from beneath the"
7046,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"lavas of Santorin, gives corroborative evidence of the early Greek use"
7047,THE METALS IN HOMER.,of the unalloyed metal.

7057,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"_Chalkos_, then, must, to begin with, have denoted copper, and indeed it"

7059,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"example, taken on board at Temesé, in Cyprus, by the Taphian king"
7060,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Mentes,[330] must have been of pure copper, the distinctively ‘Cyprian’"

7063,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"‘smelting-house,’ both instructive circumstances as regards the agency"
7064,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"by which metallic supplies were transmitted westward.[331] Again, when"
7065,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Achilles enumerated with gold and ‘grey iron,’ red _chalkos_ as forming"
7066,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"part of his wealth,[332] he could have meant nothing but unadulterated"
7067,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"copper. The colour-adjective does not recur, but its employment this"
7068,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"once strongly supports the inference that the unwrought _chalkos_,"
7069,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"frequently spoken of as stored for future use or barter, was without"

7085,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"This inference, however, cannot reasonably be carried further. Homeric"
7086,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"armour was altogether of _chalkos_, and it would be absurd to suppose"
7087,THE METALS IN HOMER.,that the ‘well-greaved Greeks’ went into action copper-clad. This on two
7088,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"grounds. In the first place, archæological research has proved to"
7089,THE METALS IN HOMER.,demonstration that bronze was fully and freely available in the late
7090,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Mycenæan age, when Homer, there is good reason to believe, flourished."
7091,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Articles composed of it must have been continually before his eyes and
7092,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"within his grasp. Unless he deliberately elected, which is"
7093,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"inconceivable, to exclude from his poems all mention of a material of"
7094,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"primary importance to the known arts, his _chalkos_ was a term"
7095,THE METALS IN HOMER.,sufficiently comprehensive to embrace _both_ bronze and copper. In the
7096,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"second place, pure copper could not have played the part assigned to it."
7097,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Its inadequacy as a material for weapons or armour should promptly have
7098,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"led to its rejection. Assuredly it could neither have sustained, nor"
7099,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"been the means of inflicting, the heavy blows and buffets exchanged by"
7100,THE METALS IN HOMER.,the heroes of the Trojan War. The mere fact of the shattering of
7101,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Menelaus’s sword against the helmet of Paris[333] is conclusive as to
7102,THE METALS IN HOMER.,its having been made of a less yielding substance than copper;[334] and
7103,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"the hardening process, by sudden cooling, imagined with the view to"
7104,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"removing the difficulty, has been pronounced, on the authority of"
7105,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"experts, impracticable.[335] The rigidity and occasional brittleness of"

7107,THE METALS IN HOMER.,tin mixed with it.

7121,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Moreover, it is incredible that the Homeric Greeks, although acquainted"
7122,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"with iron, had no share in the bronze-culture flourishing, then and"
7123,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"previously, along the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. The"
7124,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"persistence, anywhere in that region, of so late, and so extraordinarily"
7125,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"developed a copper age, would indeed be a glaring anomaly. Already,[336]"
7126,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"in the third millennium B.C., bronze tools were used in Egypt; and under"
7127,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"the name _zabar_, whence the Arabic _zifr_, bronze was fabricated by"
7128,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Sumero-Accadian metallurgists at the very outset of Mesopotamian
7129,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"civilisation.[337] It was, in fact, probably from Mesopotamia that"
7130,THE METALS IN HOMER.,knowledge of the art and its attendant advantages was carried westward
7131,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"by Sidonian traffickers. Customers, then, who, like the Achæans,"
7132,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"procured from them plentiful supplies of copper, and a smaller quantity"
7133,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"of tin, could not long have remained ignorant of the vast superiority of"
7134,THE METALS IN HOMER.,their alloyed over their separate condition. The conclusion is
7135,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"inevitable that _chalkos_, like the corresponding Hebrew term"
7136,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"_nechosheth_, and the Egyptian _chomt_, was a word of some elasticity of"
7137,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"meaning, designating ordinarily bronze, but occasionally copper. The"
7138,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"translation, it need hardly be said, of any of the three by the English"
7139,THE METALS IN HOMER.,_brass_ involves a gross error. Copper was not systematically alloyed
7140,THE METALS IN HOMER.,with zinc until about the second century B.C.[338]

7156,THE METALS IN HOMER.,But the bronze industry of old must have been seriously hampered in its
7157,THE METALS IN HOMER.,growth and spread by the scarcity of tin. This metal is of most
7158,THE METALS IN HOMER.,restricted distribution. The reservoirs of it held by the earth are few
7159,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"and far apart. The two principal, in Cornwall and the Malaccan peninsula"
7160,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"respectively, are ‘wide as the poles asunder.’ Yet its discovery goes"
7161,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"back to a hoar antiquity, and its prehistoric use was extensive and"
7162,THE METALS IN HOMER.,continuous. This wide dispersion of so scarce an article gives cogent
7163,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"proof of unexpectedly early intercourse between remote populations, and"
7164,THE METALS IN HOMER.,strikingly illustrates the effectiveness of those gradual processes of
7165,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"primitive trade by which desirable commodities permeated continents, and"
7166,THE METALS IN HOMER.,reached the least accessible markets.
7167,THE METALS IN HOMER.,
7168,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"The earliest historical source of tin was in the Cassiterides, or"
7169,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"‘tin-islands’ of Britain; and there can be no doubt, geographical"
7170,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"mystifications notwithstanding, that the tin thence derived came,"
7171,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"directly or indirectly, from Cornwall. Not improbably, the staple of the"
7172,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Phœnician tin-trade was in the Isle of Wight, which accordingly became"
7173,THE METALS IN HOMER.,the representative tin-island.[339] But this is questionable. What is
7174,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"certain is, that the metal was transported overland to the Gulf of Lyons"
7175,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"long before the Phœnicians passed the Pillars of Hercules, and was"
7176,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"available, much earlier still, in Egypt and Assyria. The Cornish was"
7177,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"not, then, the first source of supply to be opened, nor was the"
7178,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Malaccan. Tin was, in fact, an article of export from Alexandria to"
7179,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"India down to the beginning of the Christian era. The modern discovery,"
7180,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"however, of tin-mines in Khorassan, the ancient Drangiana, irresistibly"
7181,THE METALS IN HOMER.,suggests that the primitive bronze-workers derived the less plentiful
7182,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"material of their industry from the Paropamisus, and tends to confirm"
7183,THE METALS IN HOMER.,the Turanian lineage imputed to them by Lenormant.[340]

7194,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"The Homeric name for tin, _kassiteros_, is at any rate clearly of"
7195,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Oriental origin. The Greeks adopted it from the Phœnicians; the
7196,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Phœnicians _may_, it is thought, have picked it up from Accadian"
7197,THE METALS IN HOMER.,bronze-smiths along the shores of the Persian Gulf. It survives in the
7198,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Arabic _kasdîr_, and under the form _kastîra_ made its way into"
7199,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Sanskrit, on the occasion of Alexander’s invasion of the Punjâb. Pure"
7200,THE METALS IN HOMER.,tin ranked with Homer almost as a precious metal. Its scarcity gave it
7201,THE METALS IN HOMER.,prestige; but he had evidently very little acquaintance with its
7202,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"qualities. As Helbig remarks,[341] difficulties of interpretation arise"
7203,THE METALS IN HOMER.,wherever _kassiteros_ is brought on the scene. A good deal of critical
7204,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"discomfort, for instance, has been created by the statement that greaves"
7205,THE METALS IN HOMER.,of tin were included in the warlike outfit supplied to Achilles from
7206,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Olympus. And bewilderment is heightened later on by the defensive power
7207,THE METALS IN HOMER.,they are made to exhibit in the hardest trials of actual battle. In
7208,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"point of fact, they would have been as ineffective as papier-maché"
7209,THE METALS IN HOMER.,against the thrust of Agenor’s spear; and their clattering would
7210,THE METALS IN HOMER.,scarcely have produced the awe-inspiring effect ascribed to it in the

7250,THE METALS IN HOMER.,
7251,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Tin corrodes so readily that its extreme archæological rarity is not
7252,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"surprising. None has been found, either at Mycenæ or in any part of the"
7253,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"stratified débris at Hissarlik.[345] Lead, on the other hand, has been"
7254,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"disinterred from all the Trojan cities, and was in use at Mycenæ, both"
7255,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"pure, and alloyed with silver. Among the objects brought to light there"
7256,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"was a leaden figure of Aphrodite, doubtless an idol,[346] and a vessel"
7257,THE METALS IN HOMER.,in stag-shape composed of silver mixed with half its weight of
7258,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"lead.[347] The latter substance is unmentioned in the Odyssey, but is"

7260,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"can be gathered from the circumstance incidentally disclosed, that poor"
7261,THE METALS IN HOMER.,fishermen attached pieces of it as weights to their lines.[348] Its

7297,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"The Greek name for iron, _sideros_, is equally destitute of known"
7298,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"affinities. It has, indeed, sometimes been deemed cognate with the Latin"
7299,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"_sidus_, a star, on the ground that meteoric, or star-sent iron was the"
7300,THE METALS IN HOMER.,earliest form of the metal made available for human purposes; but modern
7301,THE METALS IN HOMER.,philologists do not see their way to admitting the connexion. The
7302,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"coincidence is impressive, yet may, none the less, be wholly misleading."
7303,THE METALS IN HOMER.,
7304,THE METALS IN HOMER.,The Homeric poems testify to everyday experience of the powers and
7305,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"faculties of iron. In the Iliad, knives are made of it, and rustic"
7306,THE METALS IN HOMER.,implements of all sorts; iron-tipped arrows are sped from tough bows;
7307,THE METALS IN HOMER.,iron axes perform the rough work of the forest and farm-yard. The
7308,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Odyssean functions of the metal cover a still wider range. The iron age,"
7309,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"just beginning in the first Epic, has pretty well made good its footing"
7310,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"in the second. Thus, Beloch[351] has pointed out that, while _chalkos_"
7311,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"is mentioned 279, _sideros_ only 23 times in the Iliad, the proportion"
7312,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"has become, in the Odyssey, 80 to 29; and his detailed analysis"
7313,THE METALS IN HOMER.,partially supports the conclusion that iron comes most prominently into
7314,THE METALS IN HOMER.,view in the latest portions of both poems. Yet no amount of skill in
7315,THE METALS IN HOMER.,critical carving can divide off a section of either in which ignorance
7316,THE METALS IN HOMER.,of the metal prevails. The differences are only in degrees of
7317,THE METALS IN HOMER.,acquaintanceship.

7425,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"available for ages previously. In Egypt, although _men_ (iron) may have"
7426,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"been known under the early Memphite dynasties, the nature of the"
7427,THE METALS IN HOMER.,hieroglyph employed to denote it proves that copper had the precedence.
7428,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Utensils of iron were enumerated among the spoils of Thothmes III., in"
7429,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"the seventeenth century, B.C.;[359] _barzel_ has a place in the Books of"
7430,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Moses, and was wrought at Tyre in the days of king Hiram, and no doubt"
7431,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"indefinitely earlier. The Latin _ferrum_, indeed (equivalent to the"
7432,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Semitic _barezum_) testifies, it is held, to the Phœnician introduction"
7433,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"of the metal to Italy in the twelfth century, B.C.[360]"

7448,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Its still earlier diffusion through Greece is only, then, what might"
7449,THE METALS IN HOMER.,have been expected: and the complete acquaintance with it manifested in
7450,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"the Homeric poems conveys, in itself, no presumption of lateness in"
7451,THE METALS IN HOMER.,their origin. But there are archæological difficulties. Prehistoric iron
7452,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"is unaccountably scarce in the neighbourhood of the Ægean. True, it is"
7453,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"of a perishable nature; but where not even a ferruginous stain survives,"
7454,THE METALS IN HOMER.,it is difficult to believe that objects made out of iron once existed.
7455,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Until lately, iron was believed to be entirely absent from the ruins"
7456,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"both at Hissarlik and Mycenæ, as well as from those of Orchomenos and"
7457,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Tiryns. But in 1890, Dr. Schliemann, in clearing the foundations of a"
7458,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"building on the Trojan Pergamus, came upon two lumps of the missing"
7459,THE METALS IN HOMER.,substance; and some finger-rings composed of it are among the trophies
7460,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"of the recent excavations carried on in the lower city of Mycenæ, under"
7461,THE METALS IN HOMER.,the auspices of the Greek Archæological Society.[361] But the metal was
7462,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"then evidently very rare, although the ‘bee-hive tombs,’ where it was"
7463,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"discovered, belong to a later stage of Mycenæan history than the"
7464,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"‘shaft-graves’ of the citadel. Still, the gap previously supposed to"
7465,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"divide, at this point, the Homeric from the Mycenæan world, has to a"
7466,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"certain extent been bridged; and other discrepancies may, in like"
7467,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"manner, be qualified, if not removed, by further research."

7472,THE METALS IN HOMER.,
7473,THE METALS IN HOMER.,The metals chiefly employed in Homeric verse to typify abstract
7474,THE METALS IN HOMER.,qualities are bronze and iron. The Shakespearian use of ‘golden’ to
7475,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"convey delightfulness of almost any kind, as in the expressions"
7476,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"‘_golden_ cadence of poesy,’ ‘a _golden_ mind,’ ‘_golden_ joys,’"
7477,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"‘_golden_ sleep,’ and so on, is paralleled only by the Homeric ‘_golden_"
7478,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Aphrodite.’ Lead does not exemplify, with the Greek poet, heaviness and"
7479,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"sloth, nor silver the gentle ripple of sweet sounds. But death, as ‘a"
7480,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"sleep of bronze,’ comes before us in all its unrelenting sternness;"
7481,THE METALS IN HOMER.,Stentor has a ‘voice of bronze;’ a ‘memory of bronze’ was needed for
7482,THE METALS IN HOMER.,exceptional feats of recitation; and the ‘iron noise’ of battle went up
7483,THE METALS IN HOMER.,to a ‘bronzen sky’ during the struggle ensuing upon the fall of
7484,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Patroclus. In the Odyssey, the sky is alternately of bronze and of iron,"
7485,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"the same idea of stability—of a ‘brave, o’erhanging firmament’ being"
7486,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"conveyed by both epithets.[362] Moreover, iron is there the recognised"
7487,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"symbol of pitilessness, strength of mind, and self-command. Odysseus"
7488,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"listens, masked in an ‘aspect of iron,’ while Penelope, strangely"
7489,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"touched by his still unrecognised presence, recites the weary story of"
7490,THE METALS IN HOMER.,her sorrows. A heart _steeled_—as we should say—against pity was said to
7491,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"be ‘of iron,’ as was that of Achilles against Hector in the days of his"
7492,THE METALS IN HOMER.,‘iron indignation’ at the slaying of his loved comrade; and silence and
7493,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"secrecy, even in a woman, were represented by the rigidity of that"
7494,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"unbending metal. Such metaphors occur, it is true, more frequently in"
7495,THE METALS IN HOMER.,the Odyssey than in the Iliad; but the conception upon which they are
7496,THE METALS IN HOMER.,founded is present throughout the whole sphere of Homeric thought. There
7497,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"are, nevertheless, as we have seen, clearly definable differences, in"
7498,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"the matter of metallic acquisitions, between the two great Epics. The"
7499,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"Iliad knows six, while the Odyssey refers only to four of these"
7500,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"substances, tin and lead not chancing to be noticed in its cantos; and"
7501,THE METALS IN HOMER.,"iron, in their record, has made a considerable advance upon its Iliadic"
7502,THE METALS IN HOMER.,status. This is unquestionably a circumstance to be taken into account
7503,THE METALS IN HOMER.,in attempting to deal with the Homeric problem.

7519,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,
7520,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"MAN is a tool-shaping animal. He alone infuses matter with purpose, and"
7521,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,so makes it effective for widening and strengthening his wonderful
7522,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"dominion over physical nature. What is more, his thoughts themselves"
7523,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"grow with the means at his command, and their growth in turn inspires a"
7524,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,further restless seeking after instruments of fresh conquests. The first
7525,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"metal-workers, accordingly, crossed a gulf destined to divide the ages."
7526,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,It was not for nothing that legendary honours were paid to them; they
7527,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,were the vague recognition of a really momentous advance. Its importance
7528,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"consisted, not so much in the immediate gain of power, as in the"
7529,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,implication of what was to come. For metallurgy is an art which does not
7530,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,easily stand still. Even in its crudest stages it demands some technical
7531,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,skill; and technical skill cannot be attained without division of
7532,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"labour, differentiation of classes, and development of intelligence by"
7533,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"its direction into special channels, and towards feasible ends. There"
7534,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"are, then, few better tests of civilisation than the degree of command"
7535,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,acquired over the metals.
7536,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,
7537,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,The wide compass of metallic qualities was in itself stimulating to
7538,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"ingenuity. There was always something new to be found out about them,"
7539,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,and they lent themselves with facility to every variety of treatment.
7540,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,This versatility contrasted strongly with the rigid and impracticable
7541,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"nature of the stony substances they tended to supersede. Thus, the six"
7542,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"primitive metals not only presented, at first sight, a great number of"
7543,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"diverse characteristics, but those characteristics proved, on the most"
7544,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"elementary trials, highly susceptible of change. They could be"
7545,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"surprisingly modified, for instance, by mutual admixtures, and, in a"
7546,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"lesser degree, by differences of manipulation. Secrets of the craft"
7547,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"hence multiplied, and invited, as they continue to invite, further"
7548,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,experiments and research.
7549,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,
7550,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,Of still greater consequence to civilisation at large was the
7551,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,comparatively recondite occurrence of the metals. They are not to be met
7552,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"with, like flints or pebbles, strewing the bed of every stream; their"
7553,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"distribution is defined and restricted. The demand for them could, for"
7554,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"this reason, only be supplied by opening long lines of communication; it"
7555,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"led to extended intercourse between nations, and created wants"
7556,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,stimulating to traffic.
7557,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,
7558,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Metals, besides, present themselves only by exception in the native"
7559,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"state; they are commonly disguised under some form of ore,"
7560,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"subterraneanly bestowed. Nature holds them concealed in her bosom, or at"
7561,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,most attracts the eye with niggardly samples of her treasures. The very
7562,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"word _metal_, indeed, records a ‘quest,’ a searching for something"
7563,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,hidden; and it is remarkable that these substances have been least
7564,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,effective for promoting culture just where they have come most readily
7565,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,to hand. By the shores of Lake Superior pure copper can be quarried like
7566,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"sandstone; and it was, in fact, cut away and hammered into axes and"
7567,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,knives by Indian tribes long before they came into contact with
7568,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,Europeans. A similar use has been made of meteoric iron by the
7569,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,Esquimaux. But no development of ingenuity resulted in either case. And
7570,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"for this reason among others, that the metal was used _cold_. It"
7571,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"received essentially the treatment of stone, and made very much the same"
7572,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"kind of response. Because smelting processes were not needed, forging"
7573,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"processes were not thought of. The furnace was absent, and with it the"
7574,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,power of rendering metals plastic to human wants and purposes. There
7575,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"was, then, good warrant for the figuring, as the arch-metallurgist of"
7576,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"mythology, of the incorporated element of fire."
7577,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,
7578,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Hephæstus was the Homeric Wayland Smith. He embodied the antique,"
7579,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"universal notion of magic metallurgy, but embodied it after a dignified"
7580,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,manner suitable to the grand epical standard. Homer was not given to
7581,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,repeating folk-stories current among the lower strata of—shall we
7582,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"say?—Pelasgian society. His associations were with courts and camps, his"
7583,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"sympathies with heroic achievements and maritime adventures in distant,"
7584,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"perhaps fabulous, countries. There, indeed, grotesque aboriginal fancies"
7585,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,might be permitted to flourish; but they were excluded as much as
7586,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,possible from the sunlit spaces of the Hellenic world. Even here they
7587,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"crept in unbidden, for the Homeric theology is by no means exempt from"
7588,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,the influence of rustic persuasions. But these were only admitted after
7589,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"passing through the alembic of fine fancy or ennobling thought. Thus,"
7590,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Hephæstus, although he has not wholly put off the semblance of the"
7591,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"‘drudging goblin’ of caves and cairns, stands for a formidable"
7592,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"nature-power, and possesses the capability of being sublime. Panting,"
7593,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"perspiring, shaggy, and limping, he is still no dubious divinity, but a"
7594,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,genuine Olympian. His dwelling is on the mountain of the gods; he shares
7595,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,their councils; his operations are at the command of none; he is
7596,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"self-directed and self-inspired with his art, having taken to the hammer"
7597,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,and anvil as spontaneously as the infant Hermes took to music and
7598,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"thievery. Indeed, the ill-used, yet not ill-natured, son of Heré"
7599,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,surpasses his progenitors in one important respect. He is the only one
7600,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,of the Homeric gods in whom some remnant of creative power remains
7601,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"active. He alone commands a glimmer of the Promethean spark, half-hidden"
7602,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"though it be in the ashes of material conceptions. Not, indeed, life in"
7603,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"any true sense, but faculties of perception and animation are his to"
7604,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,give to the works of his hands. His forge can turn out intelligent
7605,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"automata. Among its products are golden handmaidens,[363] conscious"
7606,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"without being self-conscious, endowed with all the useful attributes,"
7607,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,while devoid of the inconveniences of personality. Their efficiency was
7608,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"purely altruistic; they acted, but neither sought nor suffered. The"
7609,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"bellows, too, of the great Iliadic armourer could be left to blow at"
7610,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"discretion; and his wheeled tripods repaired to, and withdrew from, the"
7611,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"assembly of the gods, at fit times, unsummoned and undismissed. This"
7612,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"lingering of the creative tradition, completely dissociated from the"
7613,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"mighty Zeus, about the misshapen nursling of Thetis, illustrates his"
7614,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"connexion with Pthah, the creative and at the same time the"
7615,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,metallurgical deity of the Nile-valley.

7621,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"The Teutonic Wieland sprang from the same mythological stock. He could,"
7622,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"however, lay claim to no trait of divinity, but was merely an artist of"
7623,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"supreme skill, taught by subterranean pygmies. He was lamed by King"
7624,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Nidung, an early art-patron, eager for a monopoly of his services; but"
7625,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,eventually escaped by means of a flying-apparatus of his own
7626,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"construction, his maladroit brother Ægil barely escaping the fate of"
7627,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Icarus. Here, then, Wieland merges into Dædalus, who is only once"
7628,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"mentioned by Homer, and that as a builder. In a passage full of the"
7629,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"‘local colour’ of Crete, he is said to have constructed the ‘chorus,’ or"
7630,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,dancing-place of Ariadne.[364] The dream of a levitative art lurked
7631,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,nowhere within the Homeric field of view. Least of all had it been
7632,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"mastered by the ‘eternal smith’ of Olympus, who owed his life-long"
7633,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,infirmity to the want of a parachute. His ‘summer’s day’ fall from the
7634,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"‘crystal battlements’ of Olympus ‘on Lemnos, th’ Ægean isle,’ crippled"
7635,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,him incurably; and his return thither was effected by other than
7636,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,aeronautic means. But the story of his alliance with Dionysus is not
7637,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Homeric, so we have nothing to do with it."

7648,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"And yet it is worth recalling, as evidence that the prime metallurgists"
7649,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,of Northern and Southern Europe were offshoots from the same stem. Every
7650,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"one knows that, in the days of old, travellers’ horses were wont to be"

7654,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"testimony of Pytheas, a Massilian Greek of Alexander’s epoch, that the"
7655,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,Liparine Hephæstus conducted himself in just the same kind of way.[366]
7656,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"He worked invisibly, but could be hired to do any given job. This shows"
7657,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"a marked decline from his palmy Iliadic days, when his services might by"

7722,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"of vignettes depicted by means of polymetallic combinations, in a manner"
7723,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,wholly alien to the practice of historic antiquity. But now prehistoric
7724,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,antiquity has come to the rescue of the commentators’ perplexity. From
7725,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"the graves at Mycenæ were dug out some rusty dagger-blades, which"
7726,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"proved, on being cleaned and polished at Athens, to be skilfully"
7727,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"ornamented in coloured metallic intarsiatura. The ground is of bronze,"
7728,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,prepared with a kind of black enamel for the reception of figures cut
7729,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"out of gold-leaf tinted of various shades, from silvery-white to"
7730,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"copper-red, the details being brought out with a graver.[370] Groups of"
7731,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"men and animals, mostly in rapid motion, are thus depicted with"
7732,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"considerable vigour, and forcibly recall the naturalistic effects"
7733,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"suggested by the plastic power of the poet. ‘On these blades,’ Mr."
7734,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Gardner remarks,[371] ‘we find fishes of dark gold swimming in a stream"
7735,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,of pale gold; drops of blood are represented by inserted spots of red
7736,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,gold; in some cases silver is used. What could be nearer to Homer’s
7737,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"golden vines with silver props, or his oxen of gold and tin?’"

7748,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,This peculiar kind of damascening work was completely forgotten before
7749,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,the classical age. It seems to have originated in Egypt at least as
7750,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,early as 1600 B.C.[372] and Egyptian influences are palpable both in the
7751,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,decorative designs on the Mycenæan blades and in the mode of their
7752,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"execution. The papyrus, for instance, is conspicuous in a riverside"
7753,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"scene. Nevertheless, these remarkable objects were certainly not"
7754,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,imported. They were wrought by native artists inspired by Egyptian
7755,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,models. The freedom and boldness with which the subjects chosen for
7756,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,portrayal are treated make this practically certain. A specimen of the
7757,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"same style of work, brought from the island of Thera (now Santorin) to"
7758,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"the Museum of Copenhagen, suffices to show that acquaintance with it was"
7759,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"at one time pretty widely diffused through the Ægean archipelago, and"
7760,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,hence cannot serve to localise the origin of the Homeric poems.

7767,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,
7768,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"In its entirety, the Shield of Achilles was beyond doubt an ideal"
7769,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,creation. The poet described something imaginatively apprehended as the
7770,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"_chef-d’œuvre_ of a superhuman artist, but claiming no existence out of"
7771,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,the shining realm of fancy. Only the elements of the creation were taken
7772,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"from reality. The idea dominating its construction, of moulding a work"
7773,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"of art into a comprehensive world-picture, is eminently Oriental. It"
7774,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"recurs in the mantle of Demetrius Poliorcetes, and, more or less"
7775,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"abortively, in various Indian and Moorish embroideries. And the"
7776,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,arrangement of the sequence of scenes in concentric circles on the ‘vast
7777,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,circumference’ of the ‘orbed shield’ was certainly copied from
7778,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,Assyrio-Phœnician models.
7779,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,
7780,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,In its manufacture no iron was employed; and this was quite in
7781,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,accordance with Homeric usage. The latest metallic acquisition of the
7782,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,fore-time boasted no traditional consecration; it could impart neither
7783,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,beauty nor splendour; the part its nature assigned to it was one of
7784,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,prosaic usefulness. It is accordingly excluded from the Mycenæan scheme
7785,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"of ornament imitated in the Shield, and may, indeed, have been unknown"
7786,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,to the artists by whom that scheme was elaborated. The Olympian
7787,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Demiurgus, at any rate, was acquainted with no such substance; but then"
7788,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,the gods of Greece were never quick to adopt new improvements. So far as
7789,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Homer tells us, the only Olympian use of iron was in the chariot of"
7790,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Heré, thus described in the Fifth Iliad:"
7791,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,
7792,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"And Hebe quickly put to the car the curved wheels of bronze,"
7793,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"eight-spoked, upon their axletree of iron. Golden is their"
7794,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"felloe, imperishable, and tires of bronze are fitted thereover,"
7795,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"a marvel to look upon; and the naves are of silver, to turn"
7796,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,about on either side. And the car is plaited tight with gold and
7797,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"silver thongs, and two rails run round about it. And the silver"
7798,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,pole stood out therefrom; upon the end bound she the fair golden
7799,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"yoke, and set thereon the fair breast-straps of gold.[373]"

7805,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"This passage shows, as Dr. Leaf points out,[374] that the chariots of"
7806,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"those times, being very light, were, in the intervals of use, taken to"
7807,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,pieces and laid by on stands. That they were then covered with linen
7808,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,cloths is told to us elsewhere in the Iliad. Not all were furnished with
7809,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,eight-spoked wheels. The emphasis laid upon the fact as regards the
7810,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,goddess’s car indicates that it was exceptional; and the indication is
7811,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,confirmed by the four-spoked wheels of every vehicle in the Mycenæan
7812,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"reliefs. As to the iron axletree, it was plainly meant, not for show,"
7813,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"but for strength; yet its introduction, even in that humble capacity,"
7814,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"among the appurtenances of a divine being, can scarcely have been"
7815,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"warranted by prescription, and may have appeared a no less daring"

7823,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,Homeric archæology has assumed a new aspect since the opening of the
7824,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,prehistoric graves at Mycenæ. The doubts of centuries have now at last
7825,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,met a criterion of truth; the debates of centuries are in many cases
7826,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,already virtually closed. And this is only a beginning. If the spade be
7827,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"the best commentator, it will hardly be laid aside until further light"
7828,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,has been thrown upon still twilight places in Homeric controversy. What
7829,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"has been done is indeed surprising enough. Not very rarely, what might"
7830,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,pass—allowing for some slight poetical amplification—for the originals
7831,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"of implements or utensils described in the Epics, have been unearthed in"
7832,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,the course of the excavations begun by Dr. Schliemann. Among them is an
7833,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"excellent model, on a reduced scale, of Nestor’s Cup, an acquisition"
7834,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"almost as surprising as would have been the recovery of Jason’s Mantle,"
7835,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,or Penelope’s Web.
7836,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,
7837,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,The Pramnian beverage prepared by the skilled Hecamede for the
7838,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,refreshment of Nestor and Machaon was served in ‘a right goodly cup that
7839,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"the old man brought from home, embossed with studs of gold, and four"
7840,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,handles there were to it; and round each two golden doves were feeding;
7841,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,and to the cup were two feet below.’[375]

7847,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"The golden beaker now, after three millenniums of sepulture, exhibited"
7848,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"in the Polytechnicon at Athens,[376] has two, instead of two pairs of"
7849,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,dove-surmounted handles; but the support of each by a separate prop
7850,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"riveted on to the base, corresponds strictly to the construction with"
7851,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"‘two feet below’ (πυθμένες), as described in the Iliad. The real and"
7852,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"imagined objects unmistakably belong to the same class and epoch, and"
7853,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,their agreement is in itself strong evidence of coherence between
7854,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,Homeric and Mycenæan civilisation. The ‘studs of gold’ embossing the
7855,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,Nestorean drinking-cup were doubtless the ornamental heads of the nails
7856,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"used as rivets. The art of soldering, in the proper sense, was a later"
7857,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,discovery;[377] but the Mycenæan goldsmith sometimes had recourse to a
7858,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"cement of borax for fastening pieces of gold together. In general,"
7859,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"however, decorative adjuncts were separately cast, and afterwards"
7860,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,attached with rivets to the objects they were intended to embellish. In
7861,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"this way, probably, the purely ornamental use of metallic knobs and"
7862,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"bosses grew up. The Homeric epithets ‘silver-studded’ and ‘bossy,’"
7863,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"applied to sword-sheaths, chairs, and shields, have been copiously"
7864,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"illustrated by the discovery at Mycenæ of innumerable gold, or rather"
7865,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"gilt, discs and buttons, which had evidently once formed the adornment"
7866,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"of the sheaths and shields lying alongside.[378] At Olympia, too, bronze"
7867,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"sheathings have been found set with rows of solid silver nails,[379] by"
7868,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,means of which they may have been fastened to chairs of the exact type
7869,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,of those described in the Iliad.

7890,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"For his effects of palatial splendour, Homer relied all but exclusively"
7891,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,on the metals. Upholstery was for him non-existent. Small carpets for
7892,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"placing under the feet of distinguished persons, and rugs for their"
7893,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"beds, were the utmost luxuries known to him in this line, and they were"
7894,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"mere individual appurtenances. But for producing general effects, his"
7895,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,means were exceedingly limited. He could dispose neither of rich
7896,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"draperies, nor of silken hangings. Polished and rare woods lay outside"
7897,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,his acquaintance; the marbles of Paros and Pentelicus had not yet been
7898,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"quarried; porphyry, jasper, alabaster, and all other kinds of ornamental"
7899,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,stones seem to have been strange to him. Not so much as a coat of
7900,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"plaster, or a dash of distemper, clothed the bareness of his walls."
7901,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Floors of trodden earth, rafters blackened with smoke, chimneyless and"
7902,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"windowless apartments, belonged even to the royal residences of his"
7903,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"time, at least in Ithaca. But in a few of the more opulent houses of the"
7904,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Peloponnesus, something was done to dispel this sordid aspect by means"
7905,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,of metallic incrustations; and the possibility was made the most of by
7906,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,the poet. Nor need the looks of Mammon have been ‘always downward bent’
7907,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"in the radiant dwellings imagined by him, since their riches lay on"
7908,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"every side. They are, in the Iliad, appropriated exclusively to the"
7909,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"gods, and are vaguely characterised as ‘golden,’ or ‘of bronze,’ all"
7910,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,details of construction being omitted. But the terrene magnificence of

7957,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,can be understood to have been coated with metal plates—a mode of
7958,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"decoration usual in Mesopotamia from a very early date. Thus, the temple"
7959,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"of Bel at Babylon had its walls covered with silver and ivory, while the"
7960,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,shimmer of gold came from pavement and roof.[383] The fashion was
7961,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"adopted in Egypt, and spread to Asia Minor, perhaps through the"
7962,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"conquests of Ramses II., who built at Abydos a temple to Osiris, plated"
7963,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,with ‘silver-gold.’ It was diffused as well among the pre-Dorian Greeks.
7964,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Both the so-called ‘Treasury of Minyas’ at Orchomenus, and the ‘Treasury"
7965,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"of Atreus’ at Mycenæ, bear evident traces of having once been"
7966,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"scale-plated with bronze, not, it is thought, uniformly, but in fixed"
7967,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"patterns.[384] So, here again, archæological research supplies the most"
7968,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,instructive gloss upon the Homeric text. Metallic incrustations lost
7969,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,their charm when tinted marbles and manifold draperies had become fully
7970,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,available; but a glint of their traditional splendour was introduced by

8025,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Helen’s silver workbasket was gilt round the edges, like the ‘crater,’"

8027,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Telemachus.[389] The latter was a work of Hephæstus, and had been"
8028,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"presented to Menelaus by the king of Sidon, when he was driven thither"
8029,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"on his way back from Troy. The process of gilding, however, is well"
8030,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"known in the Odyssey, and was practised by native craftsmen. In the"
8031,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"scene of Nestor’s sacrifice at Pylos,[390] the goldsmith Laerkes is"
8032,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"summoned to gild the horns of the victim, which he evidently did by the"
8033,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,simple expedient of overlaying them with gold-leaf. Fusion had indeed
8034,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,not yet been resorted to for the purpose; nevertheless the art of
8035,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"plating silver with gold, to which is compared the beautifying action of"
8036,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Athene upon Odysseus, in order to his advantageous appearance before"
8037,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Nausicaa,[391] excites the extreme personal admiration of the poet, and"
8038,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,is regarded as a direct fruit of divine tuition. And it is noticeable
8039,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"that the artists of Mycenæ, although in most respects far above the"
8040,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Homeric standard, found the operation of plating silver directly with"
8041,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,gold so difficult that they commonly interposed a layer of copper to

8152,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"all men marvelled at the workmanship, how, wrought as they were"
8153,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"in gold, the hound was gazing on the fawn and strangling it, and"

8160,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"The brooch, it is to be observed, was duplex. Two pins were received"
8161,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"into two confronting tubes, opening opposite ways. The mechanism is"
8162,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,exemplified in the ‘pin and tube’ fastening of some golden diadems from
8163,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Mycenæ;[400] and, still more perfectly, in certain brooches exhumed at"
8164,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Præneste and Cære, each provided with two pins running into a pair of"
8165,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"tubular sheaths, a kind of hook-and-eye arrangement behind serving to"
8166,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,retain them in that position.[401] These were associated with a
8167,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"multitude of articles, known to be of Phœnician manufacture, imported"
8168,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,into Etruria during the sixth century B.C.; but the stolid sphinxes
8169,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"surmounting them were replaced, in the Ithacan ornament, by a life-like"
8170,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"representation, conceived in the true Greek spirit, although deriving"
8171,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"its motive from the typical Oriental group of a lion tearing an ox, or"
8172,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"deer.[402] This, however, had become so naturalised in Mycenæan art as"
8173,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,by no means in itself to imply a foreign origin; and the same remark
8174,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,applies to the mechanism of the Odyssean fibula. The poet certainly
8175,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,regarded it as a rare specimen of superlative skill; but the like of it
8176,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,may not improbably yet be unearthed from Greek soil.

8190,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,Smiths are not included among the Homeric _demiurgi_. The class of
8191,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,persons specially distinguished for their serviceableness to the
8192,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"community is made up of physicians, soothsayers, carpenters, and poets."
8193,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Nevertheless, there were metal-workers in Ithaca who might have competed"
8194,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"in general utility with the best of the native wizards. A smithy,"
8195,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"described as a place of common resort, was situated close to the"
8196,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Odyssean palace; and the demand for spears, swords, axes, and knives"
8197,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"must have been continual, and was certainly met by a local supply. There"
8198,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"is much doubt, however, as to whether objects claiming an artistic"
8199,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"character were produced in Ithaca. It seems more likely, on the whole,"
8200,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,that the few existing there had been imported from the Peloponnesus.
8201,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"There, presumably, Nestor’s Cup, stated to have been brought by him from"
8202,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Pylos to Troy, was manufactured; and the Brooch of Odysseus might very"
8203,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,well have been turned out from the same workshop. It is true that a
8204,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,Peloponnesian origin is never expressly attributed to objects for which
8205,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,particular admiration is sought to be enlisted. Such are either left
8206,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"undetermined, claimed for Hephæstus, or said to have come from Egypt,"
8207,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Sidon, or Cyprus. Achæan was thus plainly ranked below foreign industry."
8208,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,And this in itself indicates a falling off from the ‘golden prime’ of
8209,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Mycenæ, when Achæan craftsmen were, to say the least, not utterly below"
8210,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,compare with those of lands earlier illuminated by the rising sun of
8211,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"civilisation. Hence, products of everyday familiarity to Agamemnon had"
8212,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,become strange and wonderful to his _sacer vates_; yet the abounding
8213,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"vitality has not left them. They come before us in his songs, animated"
8214,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"with the energy of his thought, fragments of palpitating life, true"
8215,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,prognostics of the perfect art which the future was to bring to Greece.
8216,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,
8217,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,Homeric metallurgy thus plainly represents a declining stage of Mycenæan
8218,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"metallurgy; and this again included conspicuous elements from Egyptian,"
8219,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Phœnician, and Phrygian sources. Of the two first springs of influence,"
8220,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"our poet shows full consciousness, but none of the last; since his"
8221,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"admiration for spiral patterns, derived, according to the best"
8222,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"authorities, from the banks of the Sangarius, came to him at second-hand"
8223,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"from Mycenæ. The metallurgical traditions of Phrygia find, moreover, no"
8224,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,place in his verses. The dæmonic artificers of Asia Minor—the
8225,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"hammer-and-anvil goblins, sons or servants of Hephæstus, who of old"
8226,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"intangibly colonised the shores and islands of the Levant, make no"
8227,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"figure in the Iliad or Odyssey. Cabiri, Curetes, Corybantes, Idæan"
8228,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Dactyls, Rhodian Telchines, are all equally ignored in the Homeric"
8229,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,world. Hephæstus there works alone. He has neither aides-de-camp nor
8230,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"coadjutors, apart from his spontaneously helpful bellows. His"
8231,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,predilection for Lemnos was obviously due to the existence there of an
8232,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,active volcano; for Mosychlus did not become extinct until about the
8233,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"time of Alexander the Great. He, however, consulted perhaps in the"
8234,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,choice rather his primitive elemental character than his derived
8235,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,industrial function. The establishment of Cyclopean forges in the
8236,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,craters of volcanoes seems to have been a mythological after-thought.
8237,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,Its appropriateness did not at any rate strike Homer. He indeed betrays
8238,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,no direct acquaintance with subterranean fires. His Island of the
8239,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"Cyclops is entirely devoid of volcanic associations, and indeed the"
8240,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,genealogy of Polyphemus was scarcely consistent with any such
8241,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,relationship. He sprang from Poseidon; and Poseidon’s wrath at the evil
8242,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,entreatment by Odysseus of his amiable offspring was a main factor in
8243,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,the development of the subsequent narrative. For the resentment of the
8244,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,sea-god was not to be trifled with by hero or mariner who had slipped
8245,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,"unawares into that outer region of much sea and little land, where he"
8246,HOMERIC METALLURGY.,reigned supreme. _Hinc illæ lachrymæ._
