138,ETC.,"Kept as his crown his works, and thought them still"

140,ETC.,And would affirm that Homer’s poesy
141,ETC.,"Did more advance his Asian victory,"

145,ETC.,"Nor have we souls to purpose, if their loves"

147,ETC.,"How much then were this kingdom’s main soul maim’d,"

149,ETC.,That move in human souls! All realms but yours

154,ETC.,"Seas, earth, and heav’n, he did in verse comprise,"
155,ETC.,"Out-sung the Muses, and did equalize"
156,ETC.,Their king Apollo; being so far from cause
157,ETC.,"Of Princes’ light thoughts, that their gravest laws"
158,ETC.,May find stuff to be fashion’d by his lines.
159,ETC.,"Through all the pomp of kingdoms still he shines,"

161,ETC.,"Your lutes and viols, and more loftily"
162,ETC.,"Make the heroics of your Homer sung,"

183,ETC.,No gold can follow where true Poesy flies.
184,ETC.,
185,ETC.,"Then let not this divinity in earth,"
186,ETC.,"Dear Prince, be slighted as she were the birth"
187,ETC.,"Of idle fancy, since she works so high;"
188,ETC.,"Nor let her poor disposer, Learning, lie"
189,ETC.,"Still bed-rid. Both which being in men defac’d,"
190,ETC.,In men with them is God’s bright image ras’d;
191,ETC.,For as the Sun and Moon are figures giv’n
192,ETC.,"Of his refulgent Deity in heav’n,"
193,ETC.,"So Learning, and, her light’ner, Poesy,"
194,ETC.,In earth present His fiery Majesty.
195,ETC.,"Nor are kings like Him, since their diadems"
196,ETC.,"Thunder and lighten and project brave beams,"
197,ETC.,"But since they His clear virtues emulate,"
198,ETC.,"In truth and justice imaging His state,"
199,ETC.,"In bounty and humanity since they shine,"
200,ETC.,Than which is nothing like Him more divine;
201,ETC.,"Not fire, not light, the sun’s admiréd course,"
202,ETC.,"The rise nor set of stars, nor all their force"
203,ETC.,"In us and all this cope beneath the sky,"
204,ETC.,"Nor great existence, term’d His treasury;"
205,ETC.,"Since not for being greatest He is blest,"
206,ETC.,"But being just, and in all virtues best."
207,ETC.,
208,ETC.,"What sets His justice and His truth best forth,"
209,ETC.,"Best Prince, then use best, which is Poesy’s worth;"
210,ETC.,"For, as great princes, well inform’d and deck’d"
211,ETC.,"With gracious virtue, give more sure effect"
212,ETC.,"To her persuasions, pleasures, real worth,"
213,ETC.,Than all th’ inferior subjects she sets forth;
214,ETC.,"Since there she shines at full, hath birth, wealth, state,"
215,ETC.,"Pow’r, fortune, honour, fit to elevate"
216,ETC.,"Her heav’nly merits, and so fit they are,"
217,ETC.,"Since she was made for them, and they for her;"
218,ETC.,"So Truth, with Poesy grac’d, is fairer far,"
219,ETC.,"More proper, moving, chaste, and regular,"
220,ETC.,Than when she runs away with untruss’d Prose;
221,ETC.,"Proportion, that doth orderly dispose"
222,ETC.,"Her virtuous treasure, and is queen of graces;"
223,ETC.,"In Poesy decking her with choicest phrases,"
224,ETC.,Figures and numbers; when loose Prose puts on
225,ETC.,Plain letter-habits makes her trot upon
226,ETC.,"Dull earthly business, she being mere divine;"
227,ETC.,"Holds her to homely cates and harsh hedge-wine,"
228,ETC.,That should drink Poesy’s nectar; ev’ry way
229,ETC.,"One made for other, as the sun and day,"
230,ETC.,"Princes and virtues. And, as in spring,"
231,ETC.,The pliant water mov’d with anything
232,ETC.,"Let fall into it, puts her motion out"
233,ETC.,"In perfect circles, that move round about"
234,ETC.,"The gentle fountain, one another raising;"
235,ETC.,"So Truth and Poesy work; so Poesy, blazing"
236,ETC.,"All subjects fall’n in her exhaustless fount,"
237,ETC.,"Works most exactly, makes a true account"
238,ETC.,"Of all things to her high discharges giv’n,"
239,ETC.,Till all be circular and round as heav’n.
240,ETC.,
241,ETC.,"And lastly, great Prince, mark and pardon me:—"
242,ETC.,"As in a flourishing and ripe fruit-tree,"
243,ETC.,"Nature hath made the bark to save the bole,"
244,ETC.,"The bole the sap, the sap to deck the whole"
245,ETC.,"With leaves and branches, they to bear and shield"
246,ETC.,"The useful fruit, the fruit itself to yield"
247,ETC.,"Guard to the kernel, and for that all those,"
248,ETC.,Since out of that again the whole tree grows;
249,ETC.,"So in our tree of man, whose nervy root"
250,ETC.,"Springs in his top, from thence ev’n to his foot"
251,ETC.,"There runs a mutual aid through all his parts,"
252,ETC.,"All join’d in one to serve his queen of arts,[1]"
253,ETC.,In which doth Poesy like the kernel lie
254,ETC.,"Obscur’d, though her Promethean faculty"
255,ETC.,"Can create men and make ev’n death to live,"
256,ETC.,"For which she should live honour’d, kings should give"
257,ETC.,Comfort and help to her that she might still
258,ETC.,"Hold up their spirits in virtue, make the will"
259,ETC.,"That governs in them to the pow’r conform’d,"
260,ETC.,"The pow’r to justice, that the scandals, storm’d"
261,ETC.,"Against the poor dame, clear’d by your fair grace,"
262,ETC.,"Your grace may shine the clearer. Her low place,"
263,ETC.,"Not showing her, the highest leaves obscure."
264,ETC.,"Who raise her raise themselves, and he sits sure"
265,ETC.,"Whom her wing’d hand advanceth, since on it"
266,ETC.,"Eternity doth, crowning virtue, sit."
267,ETC.,"All whose poor seed, like violets in their beds,"
268,ETC.,Now grow with bosom-hung and hidden heads;
269,ETC.,"For whom I must speak, though their fate convinces"
270,ETC.,"Me worst of poets, to you best of princes."
271,ETC.,By the most humble and faithful implorer for all
272,ETC.,the graces to your highness eternized
273,ETC.,by your divine Homer.

393,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","All giving their conceits to sev’ral ends,"
394,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",He answer’d: “His affections rather choos’d
395,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","An use quite opposite to all their kinds,"
396,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","And Homer’s books should with that guard be serv’d,"
397,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",That the most precious work of all men’s minds
398,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",In the most precious place might be preserv’d.
399,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","The Fount of Wit was Homer, Learning’s Sire,"
400,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",And gave antiquity her living fire.”
401,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",
402,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Volumes of like praise I could heap on this,"
403,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Of men more ancient and more learn’d than these,"

405,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","With her own beauties, all the suffrages"
406,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Of others I omit, and would more fain"
407,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","That Homer for himself should be belov’d,"
408,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Who ev’ry sort of love-worth did contain.
409,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Which how I have in my conversion prov’d
410,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",I must confess I hardly dare refer
411,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","To reading judgments, since, so gen’rally,"
412,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Custom hath made ev’n th’ ablest agents err[2]
413,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",In these translations; all so much apply

416,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Make fish with fowl, camels with whales, engender,"

418,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","For, ev’n as diff’rent a production"
419,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Ask Greek and English, since as they in sounds"
420,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",And letters shun one form and unison;
421,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",So have their sense and elegancy bounds
422,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","In their distinguish’d natures, and require"
423,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Only a judgment to make both consent
424,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","In sense and elocution; and aspire,"
425,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",As well to reach the spirit that was spent
426,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","In his example, as with art to pierce"
427,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","His grammar, and etymology of words."
428,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","But as great clerks can write no English verse,[3]"
429,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Because, alas, great clerks! English affords,"
430,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Say they, no height nor copy; a rude tongue,"
431,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Since ’tis their native; but in Greek or Latin

433,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Though them (truth knows) they have but skill to chat in,"

436,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",The ample transmigration to be shown

440,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","The free grace of their natural dialect,"
441,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",And shame their authors with a forcéd gloss)
442,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",I laugh to see; and yet as much abhor[4]]

444,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Their full compression, and make clear the author;"
445,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","From whose truth, if you think my feet digress,"
446,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Because I use needful periphrases,"
447,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Read Valla, Hessus, that in Latin prose,"
448,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","And verse, convert him; read the Messines"

450,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Grave Salel makes in French, as he translates;"
451,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Which, for th’ aforesaid reasons, all must do;"
452,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",And see that my conversion much abates
453,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","The license they take, and more shows him too,"
454,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Whose right not all those great learn’d men have done,"
455,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","In some main parts, that were his commentors."
456,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","But, as the illustration of the sun"
457,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Should be attempted by the erring stars,"
458,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",They fail’d to search his deep and treasurous heart;

460,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Of Nature, in their downright strength of Art.[5]"
461,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",With Poesy to open Poesy:
462,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Which, in my poem of the mysteries"
463,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Reveal’d in Homer, I will clearly prove;"
464,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Till whose near birth, suspend your calumnies,"
465,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",And far-wide imputations of self-love.
466,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","’Tis further from me than the worst that reads,"
467,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Professing me the worst of all that write;
468,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Yet what, in following one that bravely leads,"
469,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","The worst may show, let this proof hold the light."
470,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",But grant it clear; yet hath detraction got
471,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",My blind side in the form my verse puts on;
472,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Much like a dung-hill mastiff, that dares not"
473,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Assault the man he barks at, but the stone"
474,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","He throws at him takes in his eager jaws,"
475,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",And spoils his teeth because they cannot spoil.
476,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",The long verse hath by proof receiv’d applause
477,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Beyond each other number; and the foil,"
478,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","That squint-ey’d Envy takes, is censur’d plain;"
479,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","For this long poem asks this length of verse,"
480,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Which I myself ingenuously maintain
481,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Too long our shorter authors to rehearse.
482,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","And, for our tongue that still is so impair’d[6]"
483,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","By travelling linguists, I can prove it clear,"
484,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",That no tongue hath the Muse’s utt’rance heir’d

486,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Strook out of rhyme, so naturally as this;"
487,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Our monosyllables so kindly fall,"
488,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",And meet oppos’d in rhyme as they did kiss;
489,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","French and Italian most immetrical,"
490,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Their many syllables in harsh collision
491,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Fall as they break their necks; their bastard rhymes
492,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Saluting as they justled in transition,"
493,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","And set our teeth on edge; nor tunes, nor times"
494,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Kept in their falls; and, methinks, their long words"
495,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Shew in short verse as in a narrow place
496,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Two opposites should meet with two-hand swords
497,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Unwieldily, without or use or grace."
498,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Thus having rid the rubs, and strow’d these flow’rs"
499,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","In our thrice-sacred Homer’s English way,"
500,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",What rests to make him yet more worthy yours?
501,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",To cite more praise of him were mere delay
502,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",To your glad searches for what those men found
503,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","That gave his praise, past all, so high a place;"
504,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Whose virtues were so many, and so crown’d"
505,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","By all consents divine, that, not to grace"
506,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Or add increase to them, the world doth need"
507,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Another Homer, but ev’n to rehearse"
508,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","And number them, they did so much exceed."
509,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Men thought him not a man; but that his verse
510,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Some mere celestial nature did adorn;
511,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","And all may well conclude it could not be,"
512,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","That for the place where any man was born,"
513,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",So long and mortally could disagree
514,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","So many nations as for Homer striv’d,"
515,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Unless his spur in them had been divine.
516,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Then end their strife and love him, thus receiv’d,"
517,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",As born in England; see him over-shine
518,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","All other-country poets; and trust this,"
519,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",That whosesoever Muse dares use her wing
520,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","When his Muse flies, she will be truss’d by his,"
521,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",And show as if a bernacle should spring
522,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Beneath an eagle. In none since was seen
523,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",A soul so full of heav’n as earth’s in him.
524,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",O! if our modern Poesy had been
525,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","As lovely as the lady he did limn,"
526,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","What barbarous worldling, grovelling after gain,"
527,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Could use her lovely parts with such rude hate,"
528,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",As now she suffers under ev’ry swain?
529,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Since then ’tis nought but her abuse and Fate,"
530,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","That thus impairs her, what is this to her"
531,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","As she is real, or in natural right?"
532,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",But since in true Religion men should err
533,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","As much as Poesy, should the abuse excite"
534,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","The like contempt of her divinity,"
535,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","And that her truth, and right saint-sacred merits,"
536,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","In most lives breed but rev’rence formally,"
537,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",What wonder is’t if Poesy inherits
538,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Much less observance, being but agent for her,"
539,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","And singer of her laws, that others say?"
540,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Forth then, ye moles, sons of the earth, abhor her,"
541,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Keep still on in the dirty vulgar way,"
542,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Till dirt receive your souls, to which ye vow,"
543,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",And with your poison’d spirits bewitch our thrifts.
544,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Ye cannot so despise us as we you;
545,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Not one of you above his mole-hill lifts
546,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","His earthy mind, but, as a sort of beasts,"
547,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Kept by their guardians, never care to hear"
548,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Their manly voices, but when in their fists"
549,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","They breathe wild whistles, and the beasts’ rude ear"
550,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Hears their curs barking, then by heaps they fly"
551,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Headlong together; so men, beastly giv’n,"
552,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","The manly soul’s voice, sacred Poesy,"
553,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Whose hymns the angels ever sing in heav’n,"
554,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Contemn and hear not; but when brutish noises,"
555,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","For gain, lust, honour, in litigious prose"
556,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Are bellow’d out, and crack the barbarous voices"
557,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Of Turkish stentors, O, ye lean to those,"
558,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Like itching horse to blocks or high may-poles;
559,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","And break nought but the wind of wealth, wealth, all"
560,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","In all your documents; your asinine souls,"
561,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Proud of their burthens, feel not how they gall."
562,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","But as an ass, that in a field of weeds"
563,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Affects a thistle, and falls fiercely to it,"
564,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","That pricks and galls him, yet he feeds, and bleeds,"
565,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Forbears a while, and licks, but cannot woo it"
566,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","To leave the sharpness; when, to wreak his smart,"
567,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","He beats it with his foot, then backward kicks,"
568,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Because the thistle gall’d his forward part;
569,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Nor leaves till all be eat, for all the pricks,"
570,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Then falls to others with as hot a strife,"
571,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",And in that honourable war doth waste
572,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","The tall heat of his stomach, and his life;"
573,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",So in this world of weeds you worldlings taste
574,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Your most-lov’d dainties, with such war buy peace,"
575,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Hunger for torment, virtue kick for vice,"
576,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","Cares for your states do with your states increase,"
577,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA","And though ye dream ye feast in Paradise,"
578,"ANGELUS POLITIANUS, IN NUTRICIA",Yet reason’s daylight shews ye at your meat

584,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,THE PREFACE TO THE READER
585,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,
586,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"Of all books extant in all kinds, Homer is the first and best. No one"
587,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"before his, Josephus affirms; nor before him, saith Velleius"
588,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"Paterculus, was there any whom he imitated, nor after him any that"
589,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,could imitate him. And that Poesy may be no cause of detraction from
590,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"all the eminence we give him, Spondanus (preferring it to all arts and"
591,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"sciences) unanswerably argues and proves; for to the glory of God, and"
592,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"the singing of his glories, no man dares deny, man was chiefly made."
593,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,And what art performs this chief end of man with so much excitation and
594,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"expression as Poesy; Moses, David, Solomon, Job, Esay, Jeremy, etc."
595,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,chiefly using that to the end abovesaid? And since the excellence of it
596,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"cannot be obtained by the labour and art of man, as all easily confess"
597,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"it, it must needs be acknowledged a Divine infusion. To prove which in"
598,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"a word, this distich, in my estimation, serves something nearly:"
599,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,
600,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"Great Poesy, blind Homer, makes all see"
601,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"Thee capable of all arts, none of thee."
602,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,
603,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,
604,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"For out of him, according to our most grave and judicial Plutarch, are"
605,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"all Arts deduced, confirmed, or illustrated. It is not therefore the"
606,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"world’s vilifying of it that can make it vile; for so we might argue,"
607,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,and blaspheme the most incomparably sacred. It is not of the world
608,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"indeed, but, like truth, hides itself from it. Nor is there any such"
609,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"reality of wisdom’s truth in all human excellence, as in Poets’"
610,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,fictions. That most vulgar and foolish receipt of poetical licence
611,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"being of all knowing men to be exploded, accepting it, as if Poets had"
612,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"a tale-telling privilege above others, no Artist being so strictly and"
613,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"inextricably confined to all the laws of learning, wisdom, and truth,"
614,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,as a Poet. For were not his fictions composed of the sinews and souls
615,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"of all those, how could they defy fire, iron, and be combined with"
616,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"eternity? To all sciences therefore, I must still, with our learned and"
617,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"ingenious Spondanus, refer it, as having a perpetual commerce with the"
618,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"Divine Majesty, embracing and illustrating all His most holy precepts,"
619,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,and enjoying continual discourse with His thrice perfect and most
620,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,comfortable Spirit. And as the contemplative life is most worthily and
621,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"divinely preferred by Plato to the active, as much as the head to the"
622,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"foot, the eye to the hand, reason to sense, the soul to the body, the"
623,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"end itself to all things directed to the end, quiet to motion, and"
624,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,eternity to time; so much prefer I divine Poesy to all worldly wisdom.
625,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"To the only shadow of whose worth, yet, I entitle not the bold rhymes"
626,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"of every apish and impudent braggart, though he dares assume anything;"
627,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"such I turn over to the weaving of cobwebs, and shall but chatter on"
628,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,molehills (far under the hill of the Muses) when their fortunatest
629,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,self-love and ambition hath advanced them highest. Poesy is the flower
630,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"of the Sun, and disdains to open to the eye of a candle. So kings hide"
631,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"their treasures and counsels from the vulgar, _ne evilescant_ (saith"
632,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"our Spond.). We have example sacred enough, that true Poesy’s humility,"
633,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"poverty, and contempt, are badges of divinity, not vanity. Bray then,"
634,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"and bark against it, ye wolf-faced worldlings, that nothing but"
635,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"honours, riches, and magistracy, _nescio quos turgidè spiratis_ (that I"
636,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,may use the words of our friend still) _qui solas leges Justinianas
637,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"crepatis; paragraphum unum aut alterum, pluris quàm vos ipsos facitis,_"
638,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"etc. I (for my part) shall ever esteem it much more manly and sacred,"
639,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"in this harmless and pious study, to sit till I sink into my grave,"
640,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,than shine in your vainglorious bubbles and impieties; all your poor
641,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"policies, wisdoms, and their trappings, at no more valuing than a musty"
642,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,nut. And much less I weigh the frontless detractions of some stupid
643,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"ignorants, that, no more knowing me than their own beastly ends, and I"
644,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"ever (to my knowledge) blest from their sight, whisper behind me"
645,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"vilifyings of my translation, out of the French affirming them, when"
646,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"both in French, and all other languages but his own, our"
647,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,with-all-skill-enriched Poet is so poor and unpleasing that no man can
648,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,discern from whence flowed his so generally given eminence and
649,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,admiration. And therefore (by any reasonable creature’s conference of
650,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,my slight comment and conversion) it will easily appear how I shun
651,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"them, and whether the original be my rule or not. In which he shall"
652,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"easily see, I understand the understandings of all other interpreters"
653,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"and commentors in places of his most depth, importance, and rapture. In"
654,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"whose exposition and illustration, if I abhor from the sense that"
655,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"others wrest and wrack out of him, let my best detractor examine how"
656,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"the Greek word warrants me. For my other fresh fry, let them fry in"
657,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"their foolish galls, nothing so much weighed as the barkings of the"
658,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"puppies, or foisting hounds, too vile to think of our sacred Homer, or"
659,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,set their profane feet within their lives’ length of his thresholds. If
660,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"I fail in something, let my full performance in other some restore me;"
661,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,haste spurring me on with other necessities. For as at my conclusion I
662,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"protest, so here at my entrance, less than fifteen weeks was the time"
663,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,in which all the last twelve books were entirely new translated. No
664,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,conference had with anyone living in all the novelties I presume I have
665,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,found. Only some one or two places I have showed to my worthy and most
666,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"learned friend, M. Harriots, for his censure how much mine own weighed;"
667,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"whose judgment and knowledge in all kinds, I know to be incomparable"
668,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"and bottomless, yea, to be admired as much, as his most blameless life,"
669,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"and the right sacred expense of his time, is to be honoured and"
670,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,reverenced. Which affirmation of his clear unmatchedness in all manner
671,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,of learning I make in contempt of that nasty objection often thrust
672,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"upon me,—that he that will judge must know more than he of whom he"
673,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,judgeth; for so a man should know neither God nor himself. Another
674,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"right learned, honest, and entirely loved friend of mine, M. Robert"
675,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"Hews, I must needs put into my confess’d conference touching Homer,"
676,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"though very little more than that I had with M. Harriots. Which two, I"
677,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"protest, are all, and preferred to all. Nor charge I their authorities"
678,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"with, any allowance of my general labour, but only of those one or two"
679,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"places, which for instances of my innovation, and how it showed to"
680,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"them, I imparted. If any tax me for too much periphrasis or"
681,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"circumlocution in some places, let them read Laurentius Valla, and"

715,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"aut uxor ejus efficieris, aut ancilla,_ &c."
716,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,
717,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,Wherein note if there be any such thing as most of this in Homer; yet
718,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"only to express, as he thinks, Homer’s conceit, for the more pleasure"
719,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"of the reader, he useth this overplus, _dum illi ades, dum illi studes,"
720,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"dum pro illo satagis, dum ilium observas, atque custodis, deorum"
721,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,commercium reliquisti._ Which (besides his superfluity) is utterly
722,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"false. For where he saith _reliquisti deorum commercium_, Helen saith,"
723,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"_θεω̑ν δ᾽ἀπόειπε κελεύθους, deorum auten abnega_ or _abnue, vias,"
724,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,ἀπείπειν (vel ἀποείπειν_ as it is used poetically) signifying
725,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,_denegare_ or _aonuere_; and Helen (in contempt of her too much
726,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"observing men) bids her renounce heaven, and come live with Paris till"
727,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,he make her his wife or servant; scoptically or scornfully speaking it;
728,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"which both Valla, Eobanus, and all other interpreters (but these _ad"
729,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,verbum_) have utterly missed. And this one example I thought necessary
730,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"to insert here, to show my detractors that they have no reason to"
731,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"vilify my circumlocution sometimes, when their most approved Grecians,"
732,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"Homer’s interpreters generally, hold him fit to be so converted. Yet"
733,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"how much I differ, and with what authority, let my impartial and"
734,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,judicial reader judge. Always conceiving how pedantical and absurd an
735,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,affectation it is in the interpretation of any author (much more of
736,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"Homer) to turn him word for word, when according to Horace and other"
737,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,best lawgivers to translators) it is the part of every knowing and
738,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"judicial interpreter, not to follow the number and order of words, but"
739,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"the material things themselves, and sentences to weigh diligently, and"
740,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"to clothe and adorn them with words, and such a style and form of"
741,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"oration, as are most apt for the language in which they are converted."
742,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,If I have not turned him ill any place falsely (as all other his
743,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"interpreters have in many, and most of his chief places) if I have not"
744,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"left behind me any of his sentences, elegancy, height, intention, and"
745,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"invention, if in some few places (especially in my first edition, being"
746,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"done so long since, and following the common tract) I be something"
747,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"paraphrastical and faulty, is it justice in that poor fault (if they"
748,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,will needs have it so) to drown all the rest of my labour? But there is
749,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"a certain envious windsucker, that hovers up and down, laboriously"
750,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"engrossing all the air with his luxurious ambition, and buzzing into"
751,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"every ear my detraction, affirming I turn Homer out of the Latin only,"
752,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"etc. that sets all his associates, and the whole rabble of my maligners"
753,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"on their wings with him, to bear about my impair, and poison my"
754,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"reputation. One that, as he thinks, whatsoever he gives to others, he"
755,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"takes from himself; so whatsoever he takes from others, he adds to"
756,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"himself. One that in this kind of robbery doth like Mercury, that stole"
757,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,good and supplied it with counterfeit bad still. One like the two
758,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"gluttons, Philoxenus and Gnatho, that would still empty their noses in"
759,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"the dishes they loved, that no man might eat but themselves. For so"
760,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"this castrill, with too hot a liver, and lust after his own glory, and"
761,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"to devour all himself, discourageth all appetites to the fame of"
762,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"another. I have stricken, single him as you can. Nor note I this, to"
763,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,cast any rubs or plashes out of the particular way of mine own
764,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,estimation with the world; for I resolve this with the wilfully
765,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,obscure:
766,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,
767,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"Sine honore vivam, nulloque numero ero."
768,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,
769,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,
770,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"Without men’s honours I will live, and make"
771,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,No number in the manless course they take.
772,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,
773,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,
774,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"But, to discourage (if it might be) the general detraction of"
775,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"industrious and well-meaning virtue, I know I cannot too much diminish"
776,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"and deject myself; yet that passing little that I am, God only knows,"
777,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,to Whose ever-implored respect and comfort I only submit me. If any
778,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"further edition of these my silly endeavours shall chance, I will mend"
779,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,what is amiss (God assisting me) and amplify my harsh Comment to
780,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"Homer’s far more right, and mine own earnest and ingenious love of him."
781,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"Notwithstanding, I know, the curious and envious will never sit down"
782,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"satisfied. A man may go over and over, till he come over and over, and"
783,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"his pains be only his recompense, every man is so loaded with his"
784,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"particular head, and nothing in all respects perfect, but what is"
785,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"perceived by few. Homer himself hath met with my fortune, in many"
786,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,maligners; and therefore may my poor self put up without motion. And so
787,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"little I will respect malignity, and so much encourage myself with mine"
788,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"own known strength, and what I find within me of comfort and"
789,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,confirmance (examining myself throughout with a far more jealous and
790,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"severe eye than my greatest enemy, imitating this:"
791,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,
792,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"Judex ipse sui totum se explorat ad unguem, &c.)"
793,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,
794,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,
795,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"that after these Iliads, I will (God lending me life and any meanest"
796,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"means) with more labour than I have lost here, and all unchecked"
797,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"alacrity, dive through his Odysseys. Nor can I forget here (but with"
798,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"all hearty gratitude remember) my most ancient, learned, and right"
799,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"noble friend, M. Richard Stapilton, first most desertful mover in the"
800,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,frame of our Homer. For which (and much other most ingenious and
801,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,utterly undeserved desert) God make me amply his requiter; and be his
802,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"honourable family’s speedy and full restorer. In the mean space, I"
803,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"entreat my impartial and judicial Reader, that all things to the quick"
804,THE PREFACE TO THE READER,"he will not pare, but humanely and nobly pardon defects, and, if he"

811,OF HOMER,
812,OF HOMER,"Of his country and time, the difference is so infinite amongst all"
813,OF HOMER,"writers, that there is no question, in my conjecture, of his antiquity"
814,OF HOMER,"beyond all. To which opinion, the nearest I will cite, Adam Cedrenus"
815,OF HOMER,placeth him under David’s and Solomon’s rule; and the Destruction of
816,OF HOMER,"Troy under Saul’s. And of one age with Solomon, Michael Glycas Siculus"
817,OF HOMER,affirmeth him. Aristotle (_in tertio de Poeticâ_) affirms he was born
818,OF HOMER,"in the isle of Io, begot of a Genius, one of them that used to dance"
819,OF HOMER,"with the Muses, and a virgin of that isle compressed by that Genius,"
820,OF HOMER,who being quick with child (for shame of the deed) came into a place
821,OF HOMER,"called Ægina, and there was taken of thieves, and brought to Smyrna, to"
822,OF HOMER,"Mæon king of the Lydians, who for her beauty married her. After which,"
823,OF HOMER,"she walking near the flood Meletes, on that shore being overtaken with"
824,OF HOMER,"the throes of her delivery, she brought forth Homer, and instantly"
825,OF HOMER,"died. The infant was received by Mæon, and brought up as his own till"
826,OF HOMER,"his death, which was not long after. And, according to this, when the"
827,OF HOMER,"Lydians in Smyrna were afflicted by the Æolians, and thought fit to"
828,OF HOMER,"leave the city, the captains by a herald willing all to go out that"
829,OF HOMER,"would, and follow them, Homer, being a little child, said he would also"
830,OF HOMER,"_ὁμηρει̑ν_ (that is, _sequi_); and of that, for Melesigenes, which was"
831,OF HOMER,"his first name, he was called Homer. These Plutarch."
832,OF HOMER,
833,OF HOMER,The varieties of other reports touching this I omit for length; and in
834,OF HOMER,place thereof think it not unfit to insert something of his praise and
835,OF HOMER,honour amongst the greatest of all ages; not that our most absolute of
836,OF HOMER,"himself needs it, but that such authentical testimonies of his"
837,OF HOMER,splendour and excellence may the better convince the malice of his
838,OF HOMER,maligners.
839,OF HOMER,
840,OF HOMER,"First, what kind of person Homer was, saith Spondanus, his statue"
841,OF HOMER,"teacheth, which Cedrenus describeth. The whole place we will describe"
842,OF HOMER,"that our relation may hold the better coherence, as Xylander converts"
843,OF HOMER,it. “Then was the Octagonon at Constantinople consumed with fire; and
844,OF HOMER,"the bath of Severus, that bore the name of Zeuxippus, in which there"
845,OF HOMER,"was much variety of spectacle, and splendour of arts; the works of all"
846,OF HOMER,"ages being conferred and preserved there, of marble, rocks, stones, and"
847,OF HOMER,"images of brass; to which this only wanted, that the souls of the"
848,OF HOMER,persons they presented were not in them. Amongst these master-pieces
849,OF HOMER,"and all-wit-exceeding workmanships stood Homer, as he was in his age,"
850,OF HOMER,"thoughtful and musing, his hands folded beneath his bosom, his beard"
851,OF HOMER,"untrimm’d and hanging down, the hair of his head in like sort thin on"
852,OF HOMER,"both sides before, his face with age and cares of the world, as these"
853,OF HOMER,"imagine, wrinkled and austere, his nose proportioned to his other"
854,OF HOMER,"parts, his eyes fixed or turned up to his eyebrows, like one blind, as"
855,OF HOMER,"it is reported he was.” (Not born blind, saith Vell. Paterculus, which"
856,OF HOMER,"he that imagines, saith he, is blind of all senses.) “Upon his"
857,OF HOMER,"under-coat he was attired with a loose robe, and at the base beneath"
858,OF HOMER,"his feet a brazen chain hung.” This was the statue of Homer, which in"
859,OF HOMER,"that conflagration perished. Another renowned statue of his, saith"
860,OF HOMER,"Lucian in his Encomion of Demosthenes, stood in the temple of Ptolemy,"
861,OF HOMER,on the upper hand of his own statue. Cedrenus likewise remembereth a
862,OF HOMER,"library in the palace of the king, at Constantinople, that contained a"
863,OF HOMER,"thousand a hundred and twenty books, amongst which there was the gut of"
864,OF HOMER,"a dragon of an hundred and twenty foot long, in which, in letters of"
865,OF HOMER,"gold, the Iliads and Odysseys of Homer were inscribed; which miracle,"
866,OF HOMER,"in Basiliscus the Emperor’s time, was consumed with fire."
867,OF HOMER,
868,OF HOMER,"For his respect amongst the most learned, Plato _in Ione_ calleth him"
869,OF HOMER,"_ἄριστον καὶ θειότατον τω̑ν ποιητω̑ν, Poeta rum omnium et"
870,OF HOMER,"præstantissimum et divinissimum; in Phædone, θει̑ον ποιητὴν, divinum"
871,OF HOMER,"Poetam_; and in _Theætetus_, Socrates citing divers of the most wise"
872,OF HOMER,"and learned for confirmation of his there held opinion, as Protagoras,"
873,OF HOMER,"Heraclitus, Empedocles, Epicharmus, and Homer, who, saith Socrates,"
874,OF HOMER,"against such an army, being all led by such a captain as Homer, dares"
875,OF HOMER,"fight or resist, but he will be held ridiculous? This for Scaliger and"
876,OF HOMER,all Homer’s envious and ignorant detractors. Why therefore Plato in
877,OF HOMER,another place banisheth him with all other poets out of his
878,OF HOMER,"Commonwealth, dealing with them like a Politician indeed, use men, and"
879,OF HOMER,"then cast them off, though Homer he thinks fit to send out crowned and"
880,OF HOMER,"anointed, I see not, since he maketh still such honourable mention of"
881,OF HOMER,"him, and with his verses, as with precious gems, everywhere enchaceth"
882,OF HOMER,"his writings. So Aristotle continually celebrateth him. Nay, even"
883,OF HOMER,"amongst the barbarous, not only Homer’s name, but his poems have been"
884,OF HOMER,"recorded and reverenced. The Indians, saith Ælianus (Var. Hist. lib."
885,OF HOMER,xii. cap. 48) in their own tongue had Homer’s Poems translated and
886,OF HOMER,"sung. Nor those Indians alone, but the kings of Persia. And amongst the"
887,OF HOMER,"Indians, of all the Greek poets, Homer being ever first in estimation;"
888,OF HOMER,whensoever they used any divine duties according to the custom of their
889,OF HOMER,"households and hospitalities, they invited ever Apollo and Homer."
890,OF HOMER,Lucian in his Encomion of Demosth. affirmeth all Poets celebrated
891,OF HOMER,"Homer’s birthday, and sacrificed to him the first fruits of their"
892,OF HOMER,"verses. So Thersagoras answereth Lucian, he used to do himself. Alex."
893,OF HOMER,"Paphius, saith Eustathius, delivers Homer as born of Egyptian parents,"
894,OF HOMER,"Dmasagoras being his father, and Æthra his mother, his nurse being a"
895,OF HOMER,"certain prophetess and the daughter of Oris, Isis’ priest, from whose"
896,OF HOMER,"breasts, oftentimes, honey flowed in the mouth of the infant. After"
897,OF HOMER,"which, in the night, he uttered nine several notes or voices of fowls,"
898,OF HOMER,"viz. of a swallow, a peacock, a dove, a crow, a partridge, a redshank,"
899,OF HOMER,"a stare, a blackbird, and a nightingale; and, being a little boy, was"
900,OF HOMER,found playing in his bed with nine doves. Sibylla being at a feast of
901,OF HOMER,"his parents was taken with sudden fury, and sung verses whose beginning"
902,OF HOMER,"was _Δμασαγ όρα πολύνικε; polynice_, signifying much victory, in which"
903,OF HOMER,"song also she called him _μεγάκλεα, great in glory_, and _στεϕανίτην_,"
904,OF HOMER,"signifying _garland-seller_, and commanded him to build a temple to the"
905,OF HOMER,"Pegridarij, that is, to the Muses. Herodotus affirms that Phæmius,"
906,OF HOMER,"teaching a public school at Smyrna, was his master; and Dionysius in"
907,OF HOMER,"his 56th Oration saith, Socrates was Homer’s scholar. In short, what he"
908,OF HOMER,"was, his works show most truly; to which, if you please, go on and"
909,OF HOMER,examine him.

1004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And quiver cover’d round, his hands did on his shoulders throw;"
1005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And of the angry Deity the arrows as he mov’d
1006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rattled about him. Like the night he rang’d the host, and rov’d"
1007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Apart the fleet set) terribly; with his hard-loosing hand
1008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His silver bow twang’d; and his shafts did first the mules command,"
1009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And swift hounds; then the Greeks themselves his deadly arrows shot.
1010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The fires of death went never out; nine days his shafts flew hot
1011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the army; and the tenth, Achilles called a court"
1012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Greeks; heav’n’s white-arm’d Queen (who, ev’rywhere cut"
1013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"short,"
1014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beholding her lov’d Greeks, by death) suggested it; and he"
1015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(All met in one) arose, and said: “Atrides, now I see"
1016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We must be wandering again, flight must be still our stay,"
1017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If flight can save us now, at once sickness and battle lay"
1018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such strong hand on us. Let us ask some prophet, priest, or prove"
1019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some dream-interpreter (for dreams are often sent from Jove)
1020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Why Phœbus is so much incens’d; if unperformed vows
1021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He blames in us, or hecatombs; and if these knees he bows"
1022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To death may yield his graves no more, but off’ring all supply"
1023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of savours burnt from lambs and goats, avert his fervent eye,"
1024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And turn his temp’rate.” Thus, he sat; and then stood up to them"
1025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Calchas, surnam’d Thestorides, of augurs the supreme;"
1026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He knew things present, past, to come, and rul’d the equipage"
1027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of th’ Argive fleet to Ilion, for his prophetic rage"
1028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Giv’n by Apollo; who, well-seen in th’ ill they felt, propos’d"
1029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This to Achilles: “Jove’s belov’d, would thy charge see disclos’d"
1030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The secret of Apollo’s wrath? then cov’nant and take oath
1031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To my discov’ry, that, with words and pow’rful actions both,"
1032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy strength will guard the truth in me; because I well conceive
1033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That he whose empire governs all, whom all the Grecians give"
1034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Confirm’d obedience, will be mov’d; and then you know the state"
1035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of him that moves him. When a king hath once mark’d for his hate
1036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man inferior, though that day his wrath seems to digest"
1037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ offence he takes, yet evermore he rakes up in his breast"
1038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brands of quick anger, till revenge hath quench’d to his desire"
1039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fire reservéd. Tell me, then, if, whatsoever ire"
1040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Suggests in hurt of me to him, thy valour will prevent?”"
1041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles answer’d: “All thou know’st speak, and be confident;"
1042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For by Apollo, Jove’s belov’d, (to whom performing vows,"
1043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O Calchas, for the state of Greece, thy spirit prophetic shows"
1044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Skills that direct us) not a man of all these Grecians here,"
1045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I living, and enjoy’ng the light shot through this flow’ry sphere,"
1046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall touch thee with offensive hands; though Agamemnon be
1047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The man in question, that doth boast the mightiest empery"
1048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all our army.” Then took heart the prophet unreprov’d,"
1049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “They are not unpaid vows, nor hecatombs, that mov’d"
1050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The God against us; his offence is for his priest impair’d
1051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Agamemnon, that refus’d the present he preferr’d,"
1052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And kept his daughter. This is cause why heav’n’s Far-darter darts
1053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These plagues amongst us; and this still will empty in our hearts
1054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His deathful quiver, uncontain’d till to her lovéd sire"
1055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The black-eyed damsel be resign’d; no rédemptory hire
1056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took for her freedom,-not a gift, but all the ransom quit,"
1057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And she convey’d, with sacrifice, till her enfranchis’d feet"
1058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tread Chrysa under; then the God, so pleas’d, perhaps we may"
1059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Move to remission.” Thus, he sate; and up, the great in sway,"
1060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Heroic Agamemnon rose, eagérly bearing all;"
1061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His mind’s seat overcast with fumes; an anger general
1062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fill’d all his faculties; his eyes sparkled like kindling fire,"
1063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which sternly cast upon the priest, thus vented he his ire:"
1064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Prophet of ill! for never good came from thee towards me
1065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not to a word’s worth; evermore thou took’st delight to be
1066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Offensive in thy auguries, which thou continu’st still,"
1067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now casting thy prophetic gall, and vouching all our ill,"
1068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shot from Apollo, is impos’d since I refus’d the price"
1069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of fair Chryseis’ liberty; which would in no worth rise
1070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To my rate of herself, which moves my vows to have her home,"
1071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past Clytemnestra loving her, that grac’d my nuptial room"
1072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With her virginity and flow’r. Nor ask her merits less
1073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For person, disposition, wit, and skill in housewif’ries."
1074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet, for all this, she shall go, if more conducible"
1075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That course be than her holding here. I rather wish the weal
1076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of my lov’d army than the death. Provide yet instantly
1077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Supply for her, that I alone of all our royalty"
1078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lose not my winnings. ’Tis not fit. Ye see all I lose mine
1079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forc’d by another, see as well some other may resign"
1080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His prise to me.” To this replied the swift-foot, god-like, son"
1081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Thetis, thus: “King of us all, in all ambition"
1082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Most covetous of all that breathe, why should the great-soul’d Greeks"
1083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Supply thy lost prise out of theirs? Nor what thy av’rice seeks
1084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our common treasury can find; so little it doth guard
1085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of what our ras’d towns yielded us; of all which most is shar’d,"
1086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And giv’n our soldiers; which again to take into our hands
1087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were ignominious and base. Now then, since God commands,"
1088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Part with thy most-lov’d prise to him; not any one of us
1089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exacts it of thee, yet we all, all loss thou suffer’st thus,"
1090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will treble, quadruple, in gain, when Jupiter bestows"
1091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sack of well-wall’d Troy on us; which by his word he owes.”
1092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Do not deceive yourself with wit,” he answer’d, “god-like man,"
1093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though your good name may colour it; ’tis not your swift foot can
1094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Outrun me here; nor shall the gloss, set on it with the God,"
1095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Persuade me to my wrong. Wouldst thou maintain in sure abode
1096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thine own prise, and slight me of mine? Resolve this: if our friends,"
1097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As fits in equity my worth, will right me with amends,"
1098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So rest it; otherwise, myself will enter personally"
1099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On thy prise, that of Ithacus, or Ajax, for supply;"
1100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let him on whom I enter rage. But come, we’ll order these"
1101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hereafter, and in other place. Now put to sacred seas"
1102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our black sail; in it rowers put, in it fit sacrifice;"
1103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to these I will make ascend my so much envied prise,"
1104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bright-cheek’d Chryseis. For conduct of all which, we must choose"
1105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A chief out of our counsellors. Thy service we must use,"
1106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Idomenëus; Ajax, thine; or thine, wise Ithacus;"
1107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or thine, thou terriblest of men, thou son of Peleüs,"
1108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which fittest were, that thou might’st see these holy acts perform’d"
1109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For which thy cunning zeal so pleads; and he, whose bow thus storm’d"
1110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For our offences, may be calm’d.” Achilles, with a frown,"
1111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus answer’d: “O thou impudent! of no good but thine own
1112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ever respectful, but of that with all craft covetous,"
1113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With what heart can a man attempt a service dangerous,"
1114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or at thy voice be spirited to fly upon a foe,"
1115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy mind thus wretched? For myself, I was not injur’d so"
1116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By any Trojan, that my pow’rs should bid them any blows;"
1117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In nothing bear they blame of me; Phthia, whose bosom flows"
1118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With corn and people, never felt impair of her increase"
1119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By their invasion; hills enow, and far-resounding seas,"
1120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pour out their shades and deeps between; but thee, thou frontless man,"
1121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We follow, and thy triumphs make with bonfires of our bane;"
1122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thine, and thy brother’s, vengeance sought, thou dog’s eyes, of  this"
1123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Troy
1124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By our expos’d lives; whose deserts thou neither dost employ
1125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With honour nor with care. And now, thou threat’st to force from me"
1126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fruit of my sweat, which the Greeks gave all; and though it be,"
1127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Compar’d with thy part, then snatch’d up, nothing; nor ever is"
1128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At any sack’d town; but of fight, the fetcher in of this,"
1129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My hands have most share; in whose toils when I have emptied me
1130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all my forces, my amends in liberality,"
1131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though it be little, I accept, and turn pleas’d to my tent;"
1132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And yet that little thou esteem’st too great a continent
1133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In thy incontinent avarice. For Phthia therefore now
1134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My course is; since ’tis better far, than here t’ endure that thou"
1135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should’st still be ravishing my right, draw my whole treasure dry,"
1136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And add dishonour.” He replied: “If thy heart serve thee, fly;"
1137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Stay not for my cause; others here will aid and honour me;
1138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If not, yet Jove I know is sure; that counsellor is he"
1139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That I depend on. As for thee, of all our Jove-kept kings"
1140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou still art most my enemy; strifes, battles, bloody things,"
1141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Make thy blood-feasts still. But if strength, that these moods build"
1142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"upon,"
1143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flow in thy nerves, God gave thee it; and so ’tis not thine own,"
1144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But in his hands still. What then lifts thy pride in this so high?
1145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Home with thy fleet, and Myrmidons; use there their empery;"
1146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Command not here. I weigh thee not, nor mean to magnify"
1147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy rough-hewn rages, but, instead, I thus far threaten thee:"
1148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since Phœbus needs will force from me Chryseis, she shall go;"
1149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My ships and friends shall waft her home; but I will imitate so
1150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His pleasure, that mine own shall take, in person, from thy tent"
1151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bright-cheek’d Briseis; and so tell thy strength how eminent
1152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My pow’r is, being compar’d with thine; all other making fear"
1153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To vaunt equality with me, or in this proud kind bear"
1154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their beards against me.” Thetis’ son at this stood vex’d, his heart"
1155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bristled his bosom, and two ways drew his discursive part;"
1156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If, from his thigh his sharp sword drawn, he should make room about"
1157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Atrides’ person, slaught’ring him, or sit his anger out,"
1158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And curb his spirit. While these thoughts striv’d in his blood and
1159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"mind,"
1160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he his sword drew, down from heav’n Athenia stoop’d, and shin’d"
1161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About his temples, being sent by th’ ivory-wristed Queen,"
1162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Saturnia, who out of her heart had ever loving been,"
1163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And careful for the good of both. She stood behind, and took"
1164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles by the yellow curls, and only gave her look"
1165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To him appearance; not a man of all the rest could see.
1166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He turning back his eye, amaze strook every faculty;"
1167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet straight he knew her by her eyes, so terrible they were,"
1168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sparkling with ardour, and thus spake: “Thou seed of Jupiter,"
1169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Why com’st thou? To behold his pride, that boasts our empery?"
1170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then witness with it my revenge, and see that insolence die"
1171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That lives to wrong me.” She replied: “I come from heav’n to see
1172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy anger settled, if thy soul will use her sov’reignty"
1173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In fit reflection. I am sent from Juno, whose affects"
1174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stand heartily inclin’d to both. Come, give us both respects,"
1175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And cease contention; draw no sword; use words, and such as may"
1176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be bitter to his pride, but just; for, trust in what I say,"
1177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A time shall come, when, thrice the worth of that he forceth now,"
1178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He shall propose for recompense of these wrongs; therefore throw
1179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Reins on thy passions, and serve us.” He answer’d “Though my heart"
1180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Burn in just anger, yet my soul must conquer th’ angry part,"
1181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yield you conquest. Who subdues his earthly part for heav’n,"
1182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Heav’n to his pray’rs subdues his wish.” This said, her charge was"
1183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,given
1184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fit honour; in his silver hilt he held his able hand,"
1185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And forc’d his broad sword up; and up to heav’n did re-ascend
1186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva, who, in Jove’s high roof that bears the rough shield, took"
1187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her place with other deities. She gone, again forsook"
1188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patience his passion, and no more his silence could confine"
1189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wrath, that this broad language gave: “Thou ever steep’d in wine,"
1190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dog’s face, with heart but of a hart, that nor in th’ open eye"
1191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of fight dar’st thrust into a prease, nor with our noblest lie"
1192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In secret ambush! These works seem too full of death for thee;
1193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,’Tis safer far in the open host to dare an injury
1194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To any crosser of thy lust. Thou subject-eating king!
1195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Base spirits thou govern’st, or this wrong had been the last foul thing"
1196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou ever author’dst; yet I vow, and by a great oath swear,"
1197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n by this sceptre, that, as this never again shall bear[2]"
1198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Green leaves or branches, nor increase with any growth his size,"
1199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor did since first it left the hills, and had his faculties"
1200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ornaments bereft with iron; which now to other end
1201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Judges of Greece bear, and their laws, receiv’d from Jove, defend;"
1202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(For which my oath to thee is great); so, whensoever need"
1203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall burn with thirst of me thy host, no pray’rs shall ever breed"
1204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Affection in me to their aid, though well-deserved woes"
1205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Afflict thee for them, when to death man-slaught’ring Hector throws"
1206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whole troops of them, and thou torment’st thy vex’d mind with conceit"
1207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of thy rude rage now, and his wrong that most deserv’d the right"
1208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all thy army.” Thus, he threw his sceptre ’gainst the ground,"
1209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With golden studs stuck, and took seat. Atrides’ breast was drown’d"
1210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In rising choler. Up to both sweet-spoken Nestor stood,"
1211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The cunning Pylian orator, whose tongue pour’d forth a flood"
1212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of more-than-honey-sweet discourse; two ages were increas’d
1213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of divers-languag’d men, all born in his time and deceas’d,"
1214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In sacred Pylos, where he reign’d amongst the third-ag’d men"
1215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, well-seen in the world, advis’d, and thus express’d it then:"
1216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Gods! Our Greek earth will be drown’d in just tears; rapeful Troy,"
1217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her king, and all his sons, will make as just a mock, and joy,"
1218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of these disjunctions; if of you, that all our host excel"
1219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In counsel and in skill of fight, they hear this. Come, repel"
1220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These young men’s passions. Y’ are not both, put both your years in"
1221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"one,"
1222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So old as I. I liv’d long since, and was companion"
1223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With men superior to you both, who yet would ever hear"
1224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My counsels with respect. My eyes yet never witness were,"
1225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor ever will be, of such men as then delighted them;"
1226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pirithous, Exadius, and god-like Polypheme,"
1227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cæneus, and Dryas prince of men, Ægean Theseüs,"
1228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man like heav’n’s immortals form’d; all, all most vigorous,"
1229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all men that ev’n those days: bred; most vig’rous men, and fought"
1230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With beasts most vig’rous, mountain beasts, (for men in strength were"
1231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,nought
1232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Match’d with their forces) fought with them, and bravely fought them"
1233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,down
1234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet ev’n with these men I convers’d, being call’d to the renown"
1235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of their societies, by their suits, from Pylos far, to fight"
1236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In th’ Apian kingdom; and I fought, to a degree of might"
1237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That help’d ev’n their mights, against such as no man now would  dare"
1238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To meet in conflict; yet ev’n these my counsels still would hear,"
1239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with obedience crown my words. Give you such palm to them;
1240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Tis better than to wreath your wraths. Atrides, give not stream"
1241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all thy pow’r, nor force his prise, but yield her still his own,"
1242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As all men else do. Nor do thou encounter with thy crown,"
1243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great son of Peleus, since no king that ever Jove allow’d"
1244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Grace of a sceptre equals him. Suppose thy nerves endow’d
1245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With strength superior, and thy birth a very goddess gave,"
1246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet he of force is mightier, since what his own nerves have"
1247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is amplified with just command of many other. King of men,"
1248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Command thou then thyself; and I with my pray’rs will obtain
1249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Grace of Achilles to subdue his fury; whose parts are
1250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Worth our entreaty, being chief check to all our ill in war.”"
1251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“All this, good father,” said the king, “is comely and good right;"
1252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But this man breaks all such bounds; he affects, past all men, height;"
1253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All would in his pow’r hold, all make his subjects, give to all"
1254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His hot will for their temp’rate law; all which he never shall
1255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Persuade at my hands. If the gods have giv’n him the great style
1256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of ablest soldier, made they that his licence to revile"
1257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Men with vile language?” Thetis’ son prevented him, and said:"
1258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Fearful and vile I might be thought, if the exactions laid"
1259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By all means on me I should bear. Others command to this,"
1260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou shalt not me; or if thou dost, far my free spirit is"
1261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From serving thy command. Beside, this I affirm (afford"
1262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Impression of it in thy soul): will not use my sword
1263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On thee or any for a wench, unjustly though thou tak’st"
1264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The thing thou gav’st; but all things else, that in my ship thou mak’st"
1265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Greedy survey of, do not touch without my leave; or do,—"
1266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Add that act’s wrong to this, that these may see that outrage too,—"
1267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then comes my part; then be sure, thy blood upon my lance"
1268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall flow in vengeance.” These high terms these two at variance
1269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Us’d to each other; left their seats; and after them arose
1270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The whole court. To his tents and ships, with friends and soldiers,"
1271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,goes
1272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Angry Achilles. Atreus’ son the swift ship launch’d, and put"
1273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within it twenty chosen row’rs, within it likewise shut"
1274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The hecatomb t’ appease the God; then caus’d to come aboard
1275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair-cheek’d Chryseis; for the chief, he in whom Pallas pour’d"
1276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her store of counsels, Ithacus, aboard went last; and then"
1277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The moist ways of the sea they sail’d. And now the king of men
1278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bade all the host to sacrifice. They sacrific’d, and cast"
1279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The offal of all to the deeps; the angry God they grac’d
1280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With perfect hecatombs; some bulls, some goats, along the shore"
1281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of the unfruitful sea, inflam’d. To heav’n the thick fumes bore"
1282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enwrapped savours. Thus, though all the politic king made shew"
1283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Respects to heav’n, yet he himself all that time did pursue"
1284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His own affections; the late jar, in which he thunder’d threats"
1285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against Achilles, still he fed, and his affections’ heats"
1286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus vented to Talthybius, and grave Eurybates,"
1287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Heralds, and ministers of trust, to all his messages."
1288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Haste to Achilles’ tent; where take Briseis’ hand, and bring"
1289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her beauties to us. If he fail to yield her, say your king"
1290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will come himself, with multitudes that shall the horribler"
1291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Make both his presence, and your charge, that so he dares defer.”"
1292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he sent them with a charge of hard condition."
1293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They went unwillingly, and trod the fruitless sea’s shore; soon"
1294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They reach’d the navy and the tents, in which the quarter lay"
1295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Myrmidons, and found the chief Chief in their sway"
1296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Set at his black bark in his tent. Nor was Achilles glad
1297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To see their presence; nor themselves in any glory had
1298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their message, but with rev’rence stocd, and fear’d th’ offended king,"
1299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ask’d not the dame, nor spake a word. He yet, well knowing the thing"

1302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I nothing blame you, but your king; ’tis he I know doth send"
1303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You for Briseis; she is his. Patroclus, honour’d friend,"
1304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bring forth the damsel, and these men let lead her to their lord."
1305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, heralds, be you witnesses, before the most ador’d,"
1306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before us mortals, and before your most ungentle king,"
1307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of what I suffer, that, if war ever hereafter bring"
1308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My aid in question, to avert any severest bane"
1309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It brings on others, I am ’scus’d to keep mine aid in wane,"
1310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since they mine honour. But your king, in tempting mischief, raves,"
1311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor sees at once by present things the future; how like waves
1312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ills follow ills; injustices being never so secure
1313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In present times, but after-plagues ev’n then are seen as sure;"
1314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which yet he sees not, and so soothes his present lust, which, check’d,"
1315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would check plagues future; and he might, in succouring right, protect"
1316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such as fight for his right at fleet. They still in safety fight,"
1317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That fight still justly.” This speech us’d, Patroclus did the rite"
1318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His friend commanded, and brought forth Briseis from her tent,"
1319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gave her the heralds, and away to th’ Achive ships they went."
1320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She sad, and scarce for grief could go. Her love all friends forsook,"
1321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And wept for anger. To the shore of th’ old sea he betook
1322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself alone, and casting forth upon the purple sea"
1323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wet eyes, and his hands to heav’n advancing, this sad plea"
1324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made to his mother; “Mother! Since you brought me forth to breathe
1325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So short a life, Olympius had good right to bequeath"
1326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My short life honour; yet that right he doth in no degree,"
1327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But lets Atrides do me shame, and force that prise from me"
1328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That all the Greeks gave.” This with tears he utter’d, and she heard,"
1329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Set with her old sire in his deeps, and instantly appear’d"
1330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up from the grey sea like a cloud, sate by his side, and said:"
1331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Why weeps my son? What grieves thee?
1332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Speak, conceal not what hath laid"
1333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such hard hand on thee, let both know.” He, sighing like a storm,"
1334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Replied: “Thou dost know. Why should I things known again inform?
1335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We march’d to Thebes, the sacred town of king Eëtion,"
1336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sack’d it, and brought to fleet the spoil, which every valiant son"
1337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Greece indifferently shar’d. Atrides had for share
1338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair-cheek’d Chryseis. After which, his priest that shoots so far,"
1339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Chryses, the fair Chryseis’ sire, arriv’d at th’ Achive fleet,"
1340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With infinite ransom, to redeem the dear imprison’d feet"
1341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his fair daughter. In his hands he held Apollo’s crown,"
1342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And golden sceptre; making suit to ev’ry Grecian son,"
1343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But most the sons of Atreüs, the others’ orderers,"
1344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet they least heard him; all the rest receiv’d with rev’rend ears
1345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The motion, both the priest and gifts gracing, and holding worth"
1346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His wish’d acceptance. Atreus’ son yet (vex’d) commanded forth
1347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With rude terms Phœbus’ rev’rend priest; who, angry, made retreat,"
1348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And pray’d to Phœbus, in whose grace he standing passing great"
1349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Got his petitión. The God an ill shaft sent abroad
1350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That tumbled down the Greeks in heaps. The host had no abode
1351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That was not visited. We ask’d a prophet that well knew
1352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The cause of all; and from his lips Apollo’s prophecies flew,"
1353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Telling his anger. First myself exhorted to appease
1354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The anger’d God; which Atreus’ son did at the heart displease,"
1355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And up he stood, us’d threats, perform’d. The black-eyed Greeks sent"
1356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,home
1357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Chryseis to her sire, and gave his God a hecatomb."
1358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then, for Briseis, to my tents Atrides’ heralds came,"
1359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And took her that the Greeks gave all. If then thy pow’rs can frame
1360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wreak for thy son, afford it. Scale Olympus, and implore"
1361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove (if by either word, or fact, thou ever didst restore"
1362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Joy to his griev’d heart) now to help. I oft have heard thee vaunt,"
1363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In court of Peleus, that alone thy hand was conversant"
1364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In rescue from a cruel spoil the black-cloud-gath’ring Jove,"
1365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom other Godheads would have bound (the Pow’r whose pace doth move
1366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The round earth, heav’n’s great Queen, and Pallas); to whose bands"
1367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou cam’st with rescue, bringing up him with the hundred hands"
1368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To great Olympus, whom the Gods call Briarëus, men"
1369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ægæon, who his sire surpass’d, and was as strong again,"
1370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And in that grace sat glad by Jove. Th’ immortals stood dismay’d
1371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At his ascension, and gave free passage to his aid."
1372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all this tell Jove; kneel to him, embrace his knee, and pray,"
1373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If Troy’s aid he will ever deign, that now their forces may"
1374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Beat home the Greeks to fleet and sea; embruing their retreat
1375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In slaughter; their pains pay’ng the wreak of their proud sov’reign’s
1376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,heat;
1377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that far-ruling king may know, from his poor soldier’s harms"
1378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His own harm falls; his own and all in mine, his best in arms.”"
1379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her answer she pour’d out in tears: “O me, my son,” said she,"
1380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Why brought I up thy being at all, that brought thee forth to be"
1381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sad subject of so hard a fate? O would to heav’n, that since"
1382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy fate is little, and not long, thou might’st without offence"
1383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And tears perform it! But to live, thrall to so stern a fate"
1384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As grants thee least life, and that least so most unfortunate,"
1385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grieves me t’ have giv’n thee any life. But what thou wishest now,"
1386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If Jove will grant, I’ll up and ask; Olympus crown’d with snow"
1387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll climb; but sit thou fast at fleet, renounce all war, and feed"
1388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy heart with wrath, and hope of wreak; till which come, thou shalt"
1389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,need
1390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A little patience. Jupiter went yesterday to feast
1391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the blameless Æthiops, in th’ ocean’s deepen’d breast,"
1392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All Gods attending him; the twelfth, high heav’n again he sees,"
1393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then his brass-paved court I’ll scale, cling to his pow’rful knees,"
1394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And doubt not but to win thy wish.” Thus, made she her remove,"
1395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And left wrath tyring on her son, for his enforcèd love."
1396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, with the hecatomb, arriv’d at Chrysa’s shore;"
1397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And when amidst the hav’n’s deep mouth, they came to use the oar,"
1398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They straight strook sail, then roll’d them up, and on the hatches"
1399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,threw;
1400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The top-mast to the kelsine then, with halyards down they drew;"
1401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then brought the ship to port with oars; then forked anchor cast;
1402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, ’gainst the violence of storm, for drifting made her fast."
1403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All come ashore, they all expos’d the holy hecatomb"
1404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To angry Phœbus, and, with it, Chryseis welcom’d home;"
1405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom to her sire, wise Ithacus, that did at th’ altar stand,"
1406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For honour led, and, spoken thus, resign’d her to his hand:"
1407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Chryses, the mighty king of men, great Agamemnon, sends"
1408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy lov’d seed by my hands to thine; and to thy God commends
1409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A hecatomb, which my charge is to sacrifice, and seek"
1410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our much-sigh-mix’d woe his recure, invok’d by ev’ry Greek.”"
1411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus he resign’d her, and her sire receiv’d her highly joy’d."
1412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the well-built altar, then, they orderly employ’d"
1413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sacred off’ring, wash’d their hands, took salt cakes; and the"
1414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"priest,"
1415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With hands held up to heav’n, thus pray’d: “O thou that all things"
1416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"seest,"
1417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fautour of Chrysa, whose fair hand doth guard fully dispose"
1418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Celestial Cilia, governing in all pow’r Tenedos,"
1419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O hear thy priest, and as thy hand, in free grace to my pray’rs,"
1420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shot fervent plague-shafts through the Greeks, now hearten their"
1421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,affairs
1422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With health renew’d, and quite remove th’ infection from their blood.”"
1423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He pray’d; and to his pray’rs again the God propitious stood.
1424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All, after pray’r, cast on salt cakes, drew back, kill’d, flay’d the"
1425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"beeves,"
1426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cut out and dubb’d with fat their thighs, fair dress’d with doubled"
1427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"leaves,"
1428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And on them all the sweetbreads’ prick’d, The priest, with small  sere"
1429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"wood,"
1430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did sacrifice, pour’d on red wine; by whom the young men stood,"
1431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And turn’d, in five ranks, spits; on which (the legs enough) they eat"
1432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The inwards; then in giggots cut the other fit for meat,"
1433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And put to fire; which roasted well they drew. The labour done,"
1434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They serv’d the feast in, that fed all to satisfaction."
1435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Desire of meat and wine thus quench’d, the youths crown’d cups of wine"
1436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Drunk off, and fill’d again to all. That day was held divine,"
1437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And spent in pæans to the Sun, who heard with pleaséd ear;"
1438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When whose bright chariot stoop’d to sea, and twilight hid the clear,"
1439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All soundly on their cables slept, ev’n till the night was worn."
1440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And when the lady of the light, the rosy-finger’d Morn,"
1441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rose from the hills, all fresh arose, and to the camp retir’d."
1442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Apollo with a fore-right wind their swelling bark inspir’d.
1443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The top-mast hoisted, milk-white sails on his round breast they put,"
1444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mizens strooted with the gale, the ship her course did cut"
1445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So swiftly that the parted waves against her ribs did roar;
1446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, coming to the camp, they drew aloft the sandy shore,"
1447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where, laid on stocks, each soldier kept his quarter as before."
1448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Peleus’ son, swift-foot Achilles, at his swift ships sate,"
1449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Burning in wrath, nor ever came to councils of estate"
1450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That make men honour’d, never trod the fierce embattled field,"
1451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But kept close, and his lov’d heart pin’d, what fight and cries could"
1452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,yield
1453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thirsting at all parts to the host, And now, since first he told"
1454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wrongs to Thetis, twelve fair morns their ensigns did unfold,"
1455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then the ever-living gods mounted Olympus, Jove"
1456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First in ascension. Thetis then, remember’d well to move"
1457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles’ motion, rose from sea, and, by the morn’s first light,"
1458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The great heav’n and Olympus climb’d; where, in supremest height"
1459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all that many-headed hill, she saw the far-seen son"
1460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Saturn, set from all the rest, in his free seat alone."
1461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before whom, on her own knees fall’n, the knees of Jupiter"
1462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her left hand held, her right his chin, and thus she did prefer"
1463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her son’s petition: “Father Jove! If ever I have stood
1464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aidful to thee in word or work, with this imploréd good,"
1465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Requite my aid, renown my son, since in so short a race"
1466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Past others) thou confin’st his life. An insolent disgrace
1467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is done him by the king of men; he forc’d from him a prise
1468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Won with his sword. But thou, O Jove, that art most strong, most wise,"
1469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Honour my son for my sake; add strength to the Trojans’ side
1470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By his side’s weakness in his want; and see Troy amplified
1471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In conquest, so much, and so long, till Greece may give again"
1472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The glory reft him, and the more illustrate the free reign"
1473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his wrong’d honour.” Jove at this sate silent; not a word
1474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In long space pass’d him. Thetis still hung on his knee, implor’d"
1475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The second time his help, and said: “Grant, or deny my suit,"
1476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be free in what thou dost; I know, thou canst not sit thus mute"
1477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For fear of any; speak, deny, that so I may be sure,"
1478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all heav’n’s Goddesses ’tis I, that only must endure"
1479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dishonour by thee.” Jupiter, the great cloud-gath’rer, griev’d"
1480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With thought of what a world of griefs this suit ask’d, being achiev’d,"
1481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Swell’d, sigh’d, and answer’d: “Works of death thou urgest. O, at this"
1482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Juno will storm, and all my pow’rs inflame with contumelies."
1483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ever she wrangles, charging me in ear of all the Gods"
1484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That I am partial still, that I add the displeasing odds"
1485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my aid to the Ilians. Begone then, lest she see;"
1486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Leave thy request to my care; yet, that trust may hearten thee"
1487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With thy desire’s grant, and my pow’r to give it act approve"
1488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How vain her strife is, to thy pray’r my eminent head shall move;"
1489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which is the great sign of my will with all th’ immortal states;
1490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Irrevocable; never fails; never without the rates
1491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all pow’rs else; when my head bows, all heads bow with it still"
1492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As their first mover; and gives pow’r to any work I will.”
1493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He said; and his black eyebrows bent; above his deathless head
1494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ ambrosian curls flow’d; great heav’n shook: and both were severéd,"
1495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their counsels broken. To the depth of Neptune’s kingdom div’d
1496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thetis from heav’n’s height; Jove arose; and all the Gods receiv’d
1497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(All rising from their thrones) their Sire, attending to his court."
1498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"None sate when he rose, none delay’d the furnishing his port"
1499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till he came near; all met with him, and brought him to his throne."
1500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor sate great Juno ignorant, when she beheld alone"
1501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Old Nereus’ silver-footed seed with Jove, that she had brought"
1502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Counsels to heav’n; and straight her tongue had teeth in it, that"
1503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,wrought
1504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This sharp invective: “Who was that (thou craftiest counsellor
1505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the Gods) that so apart some secret did implore?
1506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ever, apart from me, thou lov’st to counsel and decree"
1507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Things of more close trust than thou think’st are fit t’ impart to me.
1508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whatever thou determin’st, I must ever be denied"
1509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The knowledge of it by thy will.” To her speech thus replied
1510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Father both of men and Gods: “Have never hope to know
1511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My whole intentions, though my wife; it fits not, nor would show"
1512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Well to thine own thoughts; but what fits thy woman’s ear to hear,"
1513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Woman, nor man, nor God, shall know before it grace thine ear."
1514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet what, apart from men and Gods, I please to know, forbear"
1515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ examine, or inquire of that.” She with the cow’s fair eyes,"
1516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Respected Juno, this return’d: “Austere king of the skies,"
1517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What hast thou utter’d? When did I before this time inquire,"
1518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or sift thy counsels? Passing close you are still. Your desire
1519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is serv’d with such care, that I fear you can scarce vouch the deed"
1520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That makes it public, being seduc’d by this old sea-god’s seed,"
1521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That could so early use her knees, embracing thine. I doubt,"
1522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The late act of thy bowéd head was for the working out
1523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of some boon she ask’d; that her son thy partial hand would please
1524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With plaguing others.” “Wretch!” said he, “thy subtle jealousies"
1525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are still exploring; my designs can never ’scape thine eye,"
1526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which yet thou never canst prevent. Thy curiosity
1527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Makes thee less car’d for at my hands, and horrible the end"
1528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall make thy humour. If it be what thy suspects intend,"
1529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What then? ’Tis my free will it should; to which let way be giv’n
1530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With silence. Curb your tongue in time; lest all the Gods in heav’n
1531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Too few be and too weak to help thy punish’d insolence,"
1532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When my inaccessible hands shall fall on thee.” The sense
1533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of this high threat’ning made her fear, and silent she sate down,"
1534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Humbling her great heart. All the Gods in court of Jove did frown
1535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At this offence giv’n; amongst whom heav’n’s famous artizan,"
1536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ephaistus, in his mother’s care, this comely speech began:"
1537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Believe it, these words will breed wounds, beyond our pow’rs to bear,"
1538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If thus for mortals ye fall out. Ye make a tumult here
1539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That spoils our banquet. Evermore worst matters put down best.
1540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, mother, though yourself be wise, yet let your son request"
1541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wisdom audience. Give good terms to our lov’d father Jove,"
1542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For fear he take offence again, and our kind banquet prove"
1543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A wrathful battle. If he will, the heav’nly Light’ner can"
1544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Take you and toss you from your throne; his pow’r Olympian
1545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is so surpassing. Soften then with gentle speech his spleen,"
1546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And drink to him; I know his heart will quickly down again.”
1547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, arising from his throne, in his lov’d mother’s hand"
1548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He put the double-handed cup, and said: “Come, do not stand"
1549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On these cross humours, suffer, bear, though your great bosom grieve,"
1550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And lest blows force you; all my aid not able to relieve
1551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your hard condition, though these eyes behold it, and this heart"
1552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sorrow to think it. ’Tis a task too dang’rous to take part
1553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Against Olympius. I myself the proof of this still feel.
1554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When other Gods would fain have help’d, he took me by the heel,"
1555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And hurl’d me out of heav’n. All day I was in falling down;
1556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At length in Lemnos I strook earth. The likewise-falling sun
1557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I, together, set; my life almost set too; yet there"
1558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Sintii cheer’d and took me up.” This did to laughter cheer
1559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"White-wristed Juno, who now took the cup of him, and smil’d."
1560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sweet peace-making draught went round, and lame Ephaistus fill’d"
1561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nectar to all the other Gods. A laughter never left
1562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shook all the blesséd deities, to see the lame so deft"
1563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At that cup service. All that day, ev’n till the sun went down,"
1564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They banqueted, and had such cheer as did their wishes crown."
1565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor had they music less divine; Apollo there did touch
1566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His most sweet harp, to which, with voice, the Muses pleas’d as much."
1567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when the sun’s fair light was set, each Godhead to his house"
1568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Address’d for sleep, where ev’ry one, with art most curious,"
1569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By heav’n’s great both-foot-halting God a sev’ral roof had built.
1570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n he to sleep went, by whose hand heav’n is with lightning gilt,"
1571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"High Jove, where he had us’d to rest when sweet sleep seiz’d his eyes;"
1572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By him the golden-thron’d Queen slept, the Queen of deities."

1604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
1605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
1606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
1607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Beta the dream and synod cites;
1608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And catalogues the naval knights.
1609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
1610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
1611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The other Gods, and knights at arms, all night slept; only Jove"
1612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sweet slumber seiz’d not; he discours’d how best he might approve
1613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His vow made for Achilles’ grace, and make the Grecians find"
1614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His miss in much death. All ways cast, this counsel serv’d his mind"
1615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With most allowance; to despatch a harmful Dream to greet
1616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The king of men, and gave this charge: “Go to the Achive fleet,"
1617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pernicious Dream, and, being arriv’d in Agamemnon’s tent,"
1618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Deliver truly all this charge. Command him to convent
1619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His whole host arm’d before these tow’rs; for now Troy’s broad-way’d
1620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,town
1621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He shall take in; the heav’n-hous’d Gods are now indiff’rent grown:
1622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Juno’s request hath won them; Troy now under imminent ills
1623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At all parts labours.” This charge heard, the Vision straight fulfils;"
1624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ships reach’d, and Atrides’ tent, in which he found him laid,"
1625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Divine sleep pour’d about his pow’rs. He stood above his head
1626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like Nestor, grac’d of old men most, and this did intimate:"
1627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Sleeps the wise Atreus’ tame-horse son? A councillor of state
1628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must not the whole night spend in sleep, to whom the people are"
1629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For guard committed, and whose life stands bound to so much care."
1630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now hear me, then, Jove’s messenger, who, though far off from thee,"
1631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is near thee yet in ruth and care, and gives command by me"
1632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To arm thy whole host. Thy strong hand the broad-way’d town of Troy
1633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall now take in; no more the Gods dissentiously employ
1634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their high-hous’d powers; Juno’s suit hath won them all to her;
1635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ill fates overhang these tow’rs, address’d by Jupiter."
1636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fix in thy mind this, nor forget to give it action, when"
1637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sweet sleep shall leave thee.” Thus, he fled; and left the king of men"
1638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Repeating in discourse his dream, and dreaming still, awake,"
1639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of pow’r, not ready yet for act. O fool, he thought to take"
1640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In that next day old Priam’s town; not knowing what affairs
1641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove had in purpose, who prepar’d, by strong fight, sighs and cares"
1642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Greeks and Trojans. The Dream gone, his voice still murmured"
1643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the king’s ears; who sate up, put on him in his bed"
1644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His silken inner weed, fair, new; and then in haste arose,"
1645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cast on his ample mantle, tied to his soft feet fair shoes,"
1646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His silver-hilted sword he hung about his shoulder, took"
1647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His father’s sceptre never stain’d, which then abroad he shook,"
1648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And went to fleet. And now great heav’n Goddess Aurora scal’d,"
1649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Jove, and all Gods, bringing light; when Agamemnon call’d"
1650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His heralds, charging them aloud to call to instant court"
1651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The thick-hair’d Greeks. The heralds call’d; the Greeks made quick
1652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,resort.
1653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Council chiefly he compos’d of old great-minded men,"
1654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At Nestor’s ships, the Pylian king. All there assembled then,"
1655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus Atreus’ son begun the court: “Hear, friends: A Dream divine,"
1656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amidst the calm night in my sleep, did through my shut eyes shine,"
1657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Within my fantasy. His form did passing naturally
1658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Resemble Nestor; such attire, a stature just as high."
1659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He stood above my head, and words thus fashion’d did relate:"
1660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,‘Sleeps the wise Atreus’ tame-horse son? A councillor of state
1661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must not the whole night spend in sleep, to whom the people are"
1662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For guard committed, and whose life stands bound to so much care."
1663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now hear me then, Jove’s messenger, who, though far off from thee,"
1664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is near thee yet in love and care, and gives command by me"
1665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To arm thy whole host. Thy strong hand the broad-way’d town of Troy
1666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall now take in; no more the Gods dissentiously employ
1667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their high-hous’d pow’rs; Saturnia’s suit hath won them all to her;
1668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ill fates over-hang these tow’rs, address’d by Jupiter."
1669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fix in thy mind this.’ This express’d, he took wing and away,"
1670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And sweet sleep left me. Let us then by all our means assay
1671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To arm our army; I will first (as far as fits our right)
1672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Try their addictions, and command with full-sail’d ships our flight;"
1673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which if they yield to, oppose you.” He sate, and up arose"
1674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nestor, of sandy Pylos king, who, willing to dispose"
1675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their counsel to the public good, propos’d this to the state:"
1676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Princes and Councillors of Greece, if any should relate"
1677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This vision but the king himself, it might be held a tale,"
1678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And move the rather our retreat; but since our General
1679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Affirms he saw it, hold it true, and all our best means make"
1680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To arm our army.” This speech us’d, he first the Council brake;"
1681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The other sceptre-bearing States arose too, and obey’d"
1682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The people’s Rector. Being abroad, the earth was overlaid"
1683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With flockers to them, that came forth, as when of frequent bees"
1684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Swarms rise out of a hollow rock, repairing the degrees"
1685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of their egression endlessly, with ever rising new"
1686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From forth their sweet nest; as their store, still as it faded, grew,"
1687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And never would cease sending forth her clusters to the spring,"
1688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They still crowd out so; this fleck here, that there, belabouring"
1689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The loaded flow’rs; so from the ships and tents the army’s store
1690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Troop’d to these princes and the court, along th’ unmeasur’d shore;"
1691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst whom, Jove’s ambassadress, Fame, in her virtue shin’d,"
1692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exciting greediness to hear. The rabble, thus inclin’d,"
1693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hurried together; uproar seiz’d the high court; earth did groan
1694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Beneath the settling multitude; tumult was there alone.
1695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrice-three vocif’rous heralds rose, to check the rout, and get"
1696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ear to their Jove-kept governors; and instantly was set
1697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That huge confusion; ev’ry man set fast, the clamour ceas’d."
1698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then stood divine Atrides up, and in his hand compress’d"
1699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sceptre, th’ elaborate work of fi’ry Mulciber,"
1700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who gave it to Saturnian Jove; Jove to his messenger;
1701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His messenger, Argicides, to Pelops, skill’d in horse;"
1702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pelops to Atreus, chief of men; he, dying, gave it course"
1703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To prince Thyestes, rich in herds; Thyestes to the hand"
1704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Agamemnon render’d it, and with it the command"
1705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of many isles, and Argos all. On this he leaning, said:"
1706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O friends, great sons of Danaus, servants of Mars, Jove laid"
1707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A heavy curse on me, to vow, and bind it with the bent"
1708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his high forehead; that, this Troy of all her people spent,"
1709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I should return; yet now to mock our hopes built on his vow,"
1710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And charge ingloriously my flight, when such an overthrow"
1711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of brave friends I have authored. But to his mightiest will
1712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We must submit us, that hath raz’d, and will be razing still,"
1713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Men’s footsteps from so many towns; because his pow’r is most,"
1714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He will destroy most. But how vile such and so great an host
1715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will show to future times, that, match’d with lesser numbers far,"
1716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We fly, not putting on the crown of our so-long-held war,"
1717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of which there yet appears no end! Yet should our foes and we
1718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strike truce, and number both our pow’rs; Troy taking all that be"
1719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her arm’d inhabitants, and we, in tens, should all sit down"
1720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At our truce banquet, ev’ry ten allow’d one of the town"
1721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To fill his feast-cup; many tens would their attendant want;
1722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So much I must affirm our pow’r exceeds th’ inhabitant.
1723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But their auxiliáry bands, those brandishers of spears,"
1724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From many cities drawn, are they that are our hinderers,"
1725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not suff’ring well-rais’d Troy to fall. Nine years are ended now,"
1726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since Jove our conquest vow’d; and now, our vessels rotten grow,"
1727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our tackling falls; our wives, young sons, sit in their doors and long"
1728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For our arrival; yet the work, that should have wreak’d our wrong,"
1729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And made us welcome, lies unwrought. Come then, as I bid, all"
1730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Obey, and fly to our lov’d home; for now, nor ever, shall"
1731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our utmost take-in broad-way’d Troy.” This said, the multitude"
1732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was all for home; and all men else that what this would conclude
1733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had not discover’d. All the crowd was shov’d about the shore,"
1734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In sway, like rude and raging waves, rous’d with the fervent blore"
1735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of th’ east and south winds, when they break from Jove’s clouds, and"
1736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,are borne
1737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On rough backs of th’ Icarian seas: or like a field of corn
1738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"High grown, that Zephyr’s vehement gusts bring eas’ly underneath,"
1739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And make the stiff up-bristled ears do homage to his breath;
1740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For ev’n so eas’ly, with the breath Atrides us’d, was sway’d"
1741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The violent multitude. To fleet with shouts, and disarray’d,"
1742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All rush’d; and, with a fog of dust, their rude feet dimm’d the day;"
1743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Each cried to other, “Cleanse our ships, come, launch, aboard, away.”"
1744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The clamour of the runners home reach’d heav’n; and then, past fate,"
1745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks had left Troy, had not then the Goddess of estate"
1746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus spoke to Pallas: “O foul shame, thou untam’d seed of Jove,"
1747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall thus the sea’s broad back be charg’d with these our friends’
1748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"remove,"
1749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus leaving Argive Helen here, thus Priam grac’d, thus Troy,"
1750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In whose fields, far from their lov’d own, for Helen’s sake, the joy"
1751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And life of so much Grecian birth is vanish’d? Take thy way
1752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ our brass-arm’d people, speak them fair, let not a man obey"
1753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The charge now giv’n, nor launch one ship.” She said, and Pallas did"
1754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As she commanded; from the tops of heav’n’s steep hill she slid,"
1755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And straight the Greeks’ swift ships she reach’d; Ulysses (like to Jove
1756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In gifts of counsel) she found out; who to that base remove
1757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stirr’d not a foot, nor touch’d a ship, but griev’d at heart to see"
1758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That fault in others. To him close the blue-eyed Deity
1759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made way, and said: “Thou wisest Greek, divine Laertes’ son,"
1760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus fly ye homewards to your ships? Shall all thus headlong run?
1761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Glory to Priam thus ye leave, glory to all his friends,"
1762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If thus ye leave her here, for whom so many violent ends"
1763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have clos’d your Greek eyes, and so far from their so loved home."
1764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go to these people, use no stay, with fair terms overcome"
1765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their foul endeavour, not a man a flying sail let hoice.”"
1766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus spake she; and Ulysses knew ’twas Pallas by her voice,"
1767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ran to the runners, cast from him his mantle, which his man"
1768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And herald, grave Eurybates, the Ithacensian"
1769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That follow’d him, took up. Himself to Agamemnon went,"
1770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His incorrupted sceptre took, his sceptre of descent,"
1771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And with it went about the fleet. What prince, or man of name,"
1772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He found flight-giv’n, he would restrain with words of gentlest blame:"
1773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Good sir, it fits not you to fly, or fare as one afraid,"
1774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You should not only stay yourself, but see the people staid."
1775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You know not clearly, though you heard the king’s words, yet his mind;"
1776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He only tries men’s spirits now, and, whom his trials find"
1777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apt to this course, he will chastise, Nor you, nor I, heard all"
1778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He spake in council; nor durst press too near our General,"
1779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lest we incens’d him to our hurt. The anger of a king
1780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is mighty; he is kept of Jove, and from Jove likewise spring"
1781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His honours, which, out of the love of wise Jove, he enjoys.”"
1782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus he the best sort us’d; the worst, whose spirits brake out in"
1783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"noise,"
1784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He cudgell’d with his sceptre, chid, and said: “Stay, wretch, be still,"
1785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And hear thy betters; thou art base, and both in pow’r and skill"
1786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Poor and unworthy, without name in council or in war."
1787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We must not all be kings. The rule is most irregular,"
1788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where many rule. One lord, one king, propose to thee; and he,"
1789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whom wise Saturn’s son, hath giv’n both law and empery"
1790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To rule the public, is that king.” Thus ruling, he restrain’d"
1791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The host from flight; and then again the Council was maintain’d
1792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such a concourse, that the shore rung with the tumult made;"
1793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As when the far-resounding sea doth in its rage invade
1794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sandy confines, whose sides groan with his involvéd wave,"
1795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And make his own breast echo sighs. All sate, and audience gave."
1796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thersites only would speak all. A most disorder’d store
1797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of words he foolishly pour’d out, of which his mind held more"
1798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than it could manage; any thing, with which he could procure"
1799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laughter, he never could contain. He should have yet been sure"
1800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To touch no kings; t’ oppose their states becomes not jesters’ parts.
1801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But he the filthiest fellow was of all that had deserts
1802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Troy’s brave siege; he was squint-ey’d, and lame of either foot;"
1803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So crook-back’d, that he had no breast; sharp-headed, where did shoot"
1804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Here and there spers’d) thin mossy hair. He most of all envíed
1805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses and Æacides, whom still his spleen would chide."
1806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor could the sacred King himself avoid his saucy vein;
1807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against whom since he knew the Greeks did vehement hates sustain,"
1808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being angry for Achilles’ wrong, he cried out, railing thus:"
1809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Atrides, why complain’st thou now? What would’st thou more of us?"
1810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy tents are full of brass; and dames, the choice of all, are thine,"
1811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With whom we must present thee first, when any towns resign"
1812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To our invasion. Want’st thou then, besides all this, more gold"
1813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Troy’s knights to redeem their sons, whom to be dearly sold"
1814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I or some other Greek must take? Or would’st thou yet again
1815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Force from some other lord his prise, to soothe the lusts that reign"
1816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In thy encroaching appetite? It fits no prince to be
1817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A prince of ill, and govern us, or lead our progeny"
1818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By rape to ruin. O base Greeks, deserving infamy,"
1819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ills eternal! Greekish girls, not Greeks, ye are! Come, fly"
1820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Home with our ships; leave this man here to perish with his preys,"
1821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And try if we help’d him or not; he wrong’d a man that weighs
1822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Far more than he himself in worth; he forc’d from Thetis’ son,"
1823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And keeps his prise still. Nor think I that mighty man hath won
1824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The style of wrathful worthily; he’s soft, he’s too remiss;"
1825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or else, Atrides, his had been thy last of injuries.”"
1826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus he the people’s Pastor chid; but straight stood up to him
1827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Ulysses, who, with looks exceeding grave and grim,"
1828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This bitter check gave: “Cease, vain fool, to vent thy railing vein"
1829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On kings thus, though it serve thee well; nor think thou canst"
1830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"restrain,"
1831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With that thy railing faculty, their wills in least degree;"
1832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For not a worse, of all this host, came with our King than thee,"
1833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To Troy’s great siege; then do not take into that mouth of thine
1834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The names of kings, much less revile the dignities that shine"
1835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In their supreme states, wresting thus this motion for our home,"
1836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To soothe thy cowardice; since ourselves yet know not what will come
1837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of these designments, if it be our good to stay, or go."
1838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor is it that thou stand’st on; thou revil’st our Gen’ral so,"
1839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Only because he hath so much, not giv’n by such as thou"
1840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But our heroës. Therefore this thy rude vein makes me vow
1841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Which shall be curiously observ’d) if ever I shall hear
1842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This madness from thy mouth again, let not Ulysses bear"
1843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This head, nor be the father call’d of young Telemachus,"
1844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If to thy nakedness I take and strip thee not, and thus"
1845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whip thee to fleet from council; send, with sharp stripes, weeping"
1846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,hence
1847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This glory thou affect’st to rail.” This said, his insolence"
1848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He settled with his sceptre; strook his back and shoulders so
1849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That bloody wales rose. He shrunk round; and from his eyes did flow
1850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Moist tears, and, looking filthily, he sate, fear’d, smarted, dried"
1851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His blubber’d cheeks; and all the prease, though griev’d to be denied"
1852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their wish’d retreat for home, yet laugh’d delightsomely, and spake"
1853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Either to other: “O ye Gods, how infinitely take"
1854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses’ virtues in our good! Author of counsels, great"
1855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In ord’ring armies, how most well this act became his heat,"
1856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To beat from council this rude fool! I think his saucy spirit,"
1857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hereafter, will not let his tongue abuse the sov’reign merit,"
1858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Exempt from such base tongues as his.” Thus spake the people; then
1859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The city-razer Ithacus stood up to speak again,"
1860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Holding his sceptre. Close to him gray-eyed Minerva stood,"
1861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, like a herald, silence caus’d, that all the Achive brood"
1862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(From first to last) might hear and know the counsel; when, inclin’d"
1863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all their good, Ulysses said: “Atrides, now I find"
1864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These men would render thee the shame of all men; nor would pay
1865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their own vows to thee, when they took their free and honour’d way"
1866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Argos hither, that, till Troy were by their brave hands rac’d,"
1867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They would not turn home. Yet, like babes, and widows, now they haste"
1868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To that base refuge, ’Tis a spite to see men melted so"
1869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In womanish changes; though ’tis true, that if a man do go"
1870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Only a month to sea, and leave his wife far off, and he,"
1871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tortur’d with winter’s storms, and toss’d with a tumultuous sea,"
1872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grows heavy, and would home. Us then, to whom the thrice-three year"
1873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath fill’d his revoluble orb since our arrival here,"
1874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I blame not to wish home much more; yet all this time to stay,"
1875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out of our judgments, for our end; and now to take our way"
1876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without it, were absurd and vile. Sustain then, friends; abide"
1877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The time set to our object; try if Calchas prophesied
1878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"True of the time or not. We know, ye all can witness well,"
1879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Whom these late death-conferring fates have fail’d to send to hell)
1880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That when in Aulis, all our fleet, assembled with a freight"
1881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of ills to Ilion and her friends, beneath the fair grown height"
1882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A platane bore, about a fount, whence crystal water flow’d,"
1883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And near our holy altar, we upon the Gods bestow’d"
1884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Accomplish’d hecatombs; and there appear’d a huge portent,"
1885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A dragon with a bloody scale, horrid to sight, and sent"
1886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To light by great Olympius; which, crawling from beneath"
1887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The altar, to the platane climb’d, and ruthless crash’d to death"
1888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A sparrow’s young, in number eight, that in a top-bough lay"
1889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hid under leaves; the dam the ninth, that hover’d every way,"
1890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mourning her lov’d birth, till at length, the serpent, watching her,"
1891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her wing caught, and devour’d her too. This dragon, Jupiter,"
1892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That brought him forth, turn’d to a stone, and made a pow’rful mean"
1893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To stir our zeals up, that admir’d, when of a fact so clean"
1894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all ill as our sacrifice, so fearful an ostent"
1895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should be the issue. Calchas, then, thus prophesied th’ event"
1896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Why are ye dumb-strook, fair-hair’d Greeks? Wise Jove is he hath shown"
1897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This strange ostent to us. ’Twas late, and passing lately done,"
1898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But that grace it foregoes to us, for suff’ring all the state"

2511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The workman’s faculty, whose art can make the edge go far,"
2512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet I, less practis’d than thyself in these extremes of war,"
2513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May well be pardon’d, though less bold; in these your worth exceeds,"

2531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who rush’d betwixt the fighting hosts, and made the Trojans cease,"
2532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By holding up in midst his lance. The Grecians noted not
2533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The signal he for parley used, but at him fiercely shot,"
2534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hurl’d stones, and still were leveling darts. At last the king of men,"
2535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Agamemnon, cried aloud: “Argives! for shame, contain;"
2536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Youths of Achaia, shoot no more; the fair-helm’d Hector shows"
2537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As he desir’d to treat with us.” This said, all ceas’d from blows,"
2538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Hector spake to both the hosts: “Trojans, and hardy Greeks,"

2545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rest strike truce, and let love seal firm leagues ’twixt Greece and"
2546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Troy.”
2547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Greek host wonder’d at this brave; silence flew ev’rywhere;
2548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At last spake Sparta’s warlike king: “Now also give me ear,"
2549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom grief gives most cause of reply. I now have hope to free

2566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This granted, a delightful hope both Greeks and Trojans fed,"
2567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of long’d-for rest from those long toils, their tedious war had bred."
2568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their horses then in rank they set, drawn from their chariots round,"
2569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Descend themselves, took off their arms, and plac’d them on the ground,"
2570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Near one another; for the space ’twixt both the hosts was small.
2571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hector two heralds sent to Troy, that they from thence might call"
2572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"King Priam, and to bring the lambs, to rate the truce they swore."
2573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Agamemnon to the fleet Talthybius sent before,"
2574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To fetch their lamb; who nothing slack’d the royal charge was giv’n.
2575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Iris, the rain-bow, then came down, ambassadress from heav’n,"

2599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What choice of glory swum to her yet tender womanhood)
2600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Season’d with tears her joys to see more joys the more offence,"

2623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Labour and ruin, let her go; the profit of our land"
2624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must pass the beauty.” Thus, though these could bear so fit a hand"

2626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They could not choose but welcome her, and rather they accus’d"

2638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fairest of her sex replied: “Most rev’rend father-in-law,"
2639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Most lov’d, most fear’d, would some ill death had seiz’d me, when I saw"

2642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my sole daughter, brothers both, with all those kindly mates,"
2643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of one soil, one age, born with me, though under diff’rent fates!"

2664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To equal these Achaian youths, that have the sable eyes.”"
2665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then (seeing Ulysses next) he said: “Lov’d daughter, what is he"
2666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, lower than great Atreus’ son; seems by the head to me,"
2667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, in his shoulders and big breast, presents a broader show?"
2668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His armour lies upon the earth; he up and down doth go,"
2669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see his soldiers keep their ranks, and ready have their arms,"
2670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If, in this truce, they should be tried by any false alarms."
2671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much like a well-grown bell-wether, or feltred ram, he shows,"

2673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
2674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,High Jove and Leda’s fairest seed to Priam thus replies:

2677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet knows he ev’ry sort of sleight, and is in counsels great.”"
2678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
2679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wise Antenor answer’d her: “’Tis true, renownéd dame;"
2680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, some times past, wise Ithacus to Troy a legate came,"
2681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With Menelaus, for your cause; to whom I gave receipt"
2682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As guests, and welcom’d to my house, with all the love I might."
2683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I learn’d the wisdom of their souls, and humours of their blood;"
2684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For when the Trojan council met, and these together stood,"
2685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By height of his broad shoulders had Atrides eminence,"
2686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, set, Ulysses did exceed, and bred more reverence."
2687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And when their counsels and their words they wove in one, the speech"
2688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Atreus’ son was passing loud, small, fast, yet did not reach"
2689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To much, being naturally born Laconical; nor would"
2690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His humour lie for anything, or was, like th’ other, old;"
2691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when the prudent Ithacus did to his counsels rise,"
2692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He stood a little still, and fix’d upon the earth his eyes,"
2693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sceptre moving neither way, but held it formally,"
2694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like one that vainly doth affect. Of wrathful quality,"
2695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And frantic (rashly judging him) you would have said he was,"
2696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when, out of his ample breast he gave his great voice pass,"
2697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And words that flew about our ears, like drifts of winter’s snow,"
2698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"None thenceforth might contend with him, tho’ nought admir’d for show.”"
2699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
2700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The third man, aged Priam mark’d, was Ajax Telamon,"
2701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of whom he ask’d: “What lord is that, so large of limb and bone,"
2702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So rais’d in height, that to his breast I see there reacheth none?”"
2703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
2704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To him the Goddess of her sex, the large-veil’d Helen, said:"

2718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
2719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor so; for holy Tellus’ womb inclos’d those worthy men
2720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Sparta, their belovéd soil. The voiceful heralds then"
2721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The firm agreement of the Gods through all the city ring;
2722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two lambs, and spirit-refreshing wine (the fruit of earth) they bring,"
2723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Within a goat-skin bottle clos’d; Idæus also brought
2724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A massy glitt’ring bowl, and cups, that all of gold were wrought;"

2734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He said; and Priam’s aged joints with chilled fear did shake,"
2735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet instantly he bade his men his chariot ready make.
2736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which soon they did, and he ascends. He takes the reins, and guide"
2737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antenor calls; who instantly mounts to his royal side,"
2738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, through the Scæan ports to field, the swift-foot horse they drive."

2743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The true vows of the Gods (term’d theirs, since made before their eyes)"
2744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then in a cup of gold they mix the wine that each side brings,"

2746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which done, Atrides drew his knife, that evermore he put"

2750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The heralds of both hosts did give the peers of both; and then,"
2751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With hands and voice advanc’d to heav’n, thus pray’d the king of men:"

2753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Jove, that Ida dost protect, and hast the titles won"
2754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Most glorious, most invincible; and thou all-seeing Sun,"
2755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All-hearing, all-recomforting; Floods; Earth; and Pow’rs beneath,"
2756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That all the perjuries of men chastise ev’n after death!
2757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be witnesses, and see perform’d the hearty vows we make.—"
2758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If Alexander shall the life of Menelaus take,"
2759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He shall from henceforth Helena, with all her wealth, retain,"
2760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And we will to our household Gods, hoise sail, and home again."
2761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If, by my honour’d brother’s hand, be Alexander slain,"
2762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans then shall his forc’d queen, with all her wealth, restore,"
2763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And pay convenient fine to us, aid ours for evermore."
2764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If Priam and his sons deny to pay his, thus agreed,"
2765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Alexander shall be slain; or that perfidious deed,"
2766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And for the fine, will I fight here, till dearly they repay,"
2767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By death and ruin, the amends, that falsehood keeps away.”"
2768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, the throats of both the lambs cut with his royal knife,"
2769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He laid them panting on the earth, till, quite depriv’d of life,"
2770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The steel had robb’d them of their strength; then golden cups they
2771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"crown’d,"
2772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With wine out of a cistern drawn; which pour’d upon the ground,"
2773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They fell upon their humble knees to all the Deities,"
2774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus pray’d one of both the hosts, that might do sacrifice:"
2775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Jupiter, most high, most great, and all the deathless Pow’rs!"
2776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who first shall dare to violate the late sworn oaths of ours,"
2777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So let the bloods and brains of them, and all they shall produce,"
2778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flow on the stain’d face of the earth, as now this sacred juice;"
2779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And let their wives with bastardice brand all their future race.”
2780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus pray’d they; but, with wish’d effects, their pray’rs Jove did not"
2781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,grace;
2782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Priam said: “Lords of both hosts, I can no longer stay"
2783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see my lov’d son try his life, and so must take my way"
2784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To wind-exposéd Ilion. Jove yet and heav’n’s high States
2785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Know only, which of these must now pay tribute to the Fates.”"
2786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus, putting in his coach the lambs, he mounts and reins his horse;"
2787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antenor to him; and to Troy, both take their speedy course."
2788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Hector, Priam’s martial son, stepp’d forth, and met the ground,"
2789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With wise Ulysses, where the blows of combat must resound;"
2790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which done, into a helm they put two lots, to let them know"
2791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which of the combatants should first his brass-pil’d jav’lin throw;
2792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When all the people standing by, with hands held up to heav’n,"
2793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pray’d Jove the conquest might not be by force or fortune giv’n,"
2794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But that the man, who was in right the author of most wrong,"
2795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Might feel his justice, and no more these tedious wars prolong,"
2796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, sinking to the house of death, leave them (as long before)"
2797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Link’d fast in leagues of amity, that might dissolve no more."
2798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Hector shook the helm that held the equal dooms of chance,"
2799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Look’d back, and drew; and Paris first had lot to hurl his lance,"
2800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The soldiers all sat down enrank’d, each by his arms and horse"
2801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That then lay down and cool’d their hoofs. And now th’ allotted course
2802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bids fair-hair’d Helen’s husband arm; who first makes fast his greaves
2803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With silver buckles to his legs; then on his breast receives
2804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The curets that Lycaon wore (his brother) but made fit
2805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For his fair body; next his sword he took, and fasten’d it,"
2806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All damask’d, underneath his arm; his shield then grave and great"
2807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His shoulders wore; and on his head his glorious helm he set,"
2808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Topp’d with a plume of horse’s hair, that horribly did dance,"
2809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And seem’d to threaten as he mov’d; at last he takes his lance,"
2810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exceeding big, and full of weight, which he with ease could use."
2811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In like sort, Sparta’s warlike king himself with arms indues."
2812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus arm’d at either army both, they both stood bravely in,"
2813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Possessing both hosts with amaze, they came so chin to chin,"
2814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, with such horrible aspécts, each other did salute."
2815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A fair large field was made for them; where wraths, for hugeness mute,"
2816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And mutual, made them mutually at either shake their darts"
2817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before they threw. Then Paris first with his long jav’lin parts;
2818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It smote Atrides’ orby targe, but ran not through the brass,"
2819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For in it (arming well the shield) the head reflected was.
2820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then did the second combatant apply him to his spear,"
2821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which ere he threw, he thus besought almighty Jupiter:"
2822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Jove! Vouchsafe me now revenge, and that my enemy,"
2823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For doing wrong so undeserv’d, may pay deservedly"
2824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The pains he forfeited; and let these hands inflict those pains,"
2825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By conqu’ring, ay, by conqu’ring dead, him on whom life complains;"
2826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That any now, or anyone of all the brood of men"
2827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To live hereafter, may with fear from all offence abstain,"
2828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much more from all such foul offence to him that was his host,"
2829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And entertain’d him as the man whom he affected most.”
2830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he shook and threw his lance; which strook through Paris’"
2831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"shield,"
2832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, with the strength he gave to it, it made the curets yield,"
2833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His coat of mail, his breast, and all, and drove his entrails in,"
2834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In that low region where the guts in three small parts begin;
2835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet he, in bowing of his breast, prvented sable death."
2836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This taint he follow’d with his sword, drawn from a silver sheath,"
2837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which lifting high, he strook his helm full where his plume did stand,"
2838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On which it piecemeal brake, and fell from his unhappy hand."
2839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At which he sighing stood, and star’d upon the ample sky,"
2840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “O Jove, there is no God giv’n more illiberally"
2841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To those that serve thee than thyself, why have I pray’d in vain?"
2842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I hop’d my hand should have reveng’d, the wrongs I still sustain,"
2843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On him that did them, and still dares their foul defence pursue;"
2844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now my lance hath miss’d his end, my sword in shivers flew,"
2845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he ’scapes all.” With this, again he rush’d upon his guest,"
2846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And caught him by the horse-hair plume, that dangled on his crest,"
2847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With thought to drag him to the Greeks; which he had surely done,"
2848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so, besides the victory, had wondrous glory won,"
2849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Because the needle-painted lace, with which his helm was tied"
2850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath his chin, and so about his dainty throat implied,"
2851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had strangled him;) but that, in time, the Cyprian seed of Jove"
2852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did brake the string, with which was lin’d that which the needle wove,"
2853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And was the tough thong of a steer; and so the victor’s palm
2854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was, for so full a man-at-arms, only an empty helm."
2855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That then he swung about his head, and cast among his friends,"
2856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who scrambled, and took ’t up with shouts. Again then he intends"
2857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To force the life-blood of his foe, and ran on him amain,"
2858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With shaken jav’lin; when the Queen, that lovers loves, again[1]"
2859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Attended, and now ravish’d him from that encounter quite,"
2860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With ease, and wondrous suddenly; for she, a Goddess, might."
2861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She hid him in a cloud of gold, and never made him known,"
2862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till in his chamber, fresh and sweet, she gently set him down,"
2863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And went for Helen; whom she found in Scæa’s utmost height,"
2864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To which whole swarms of city dames had climb’d to see the sight.
2865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To give her errand good success, she took on her the shape"
2866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of beldame Græa, who was brought by Helen, in her rape,"
2867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Lacedæmon, and had trust in all her secrets still,"
2868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being old, and had (of all her maids) the main bent of her will,"
2869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And spun for her her finest wool. Like her, Love’s Empress came,"
2870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pull’d Helen by the heav’nly veil, and softly said: “Madame,"
2871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My lord calls for you, you must needs make all your kind haste home;"
2872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He’s in your chamber, stays, and longs; sits by your bed; pray come,"
2873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Tis richly made, and sweet; but he more sweet, and looks so clear,"
2874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So fresh, and movingly attir’d, that, seeing, you would swear"
2875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He came not from the dusky fight, but from a courtly dance,"
2876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or would to dancing.” This she made a charm for dalliance;
2877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose virtue Helen felt, and knew, by her so radiant eyes,"
2878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"White neck, and most enticing breasts, the deified disguise."
2879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At which amaz’d, she answer’d her: “Unhappy Deity!"
2880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Why lov’st thou still in these deceits to wrap my phantasy?
2881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or whither yet, of all the towns giv’n to their lust beside,"
2882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Phrygia, or Mæonia, com’st thou to be my guide,"
2883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If there (of divers-languag’d men thou hast, as here in Troy,"
2884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some other friend to be my shame; since here thy latest joy
2885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Menelaus now subdu’d, by him shall I be borne"
2886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Home to his court, and end my life in triumphs of his scorn?"
2887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, to this end, would thy deceits my wanton life allure?"
2888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hence, go thyself to Priam’s son and all the ways abjure"
2889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Gods, or godlike-minded dames, nor ever turn again"
2890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy earth-affecting feet to heav’n but for his sake sustain
2891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Toils here; guard, grace him endlessly, till he requite thy grace"
2892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By giving thee my place with him; or take his servant’s place,"
2893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If, all dishonourable ways, your favours seek to serve"
2894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His never-pleas’d incontinence; I better will deserve,"
2895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Than serve his dotage now. What shame were it for me to feed
2896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This lust in him; all honour’d dames would hate me for the deed!
2897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He leaves a woman’s love so sham’d, and shows so base a mind,"
2898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To feel nor my shame nor his own; griefs of a greater kind
2899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wound me than such as can admit such kind delights so soon.”
2900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Goddess, angry that, past shame, her mere will was not done,"
2901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Replied: “Incense me not, you wretch, lest, once incens’d, I leave"
2902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy curs’d life to as strange a hate, as yet it may receive"
2903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A love from me; and lest I spread through both hosts such despite,"
2904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For those plagues they have felt for thee, that both abjure thee quite,"
2905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And setting thee in midst of both, turn all their wraths on thee,"
2906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And dart thee dead; that such a death may wreak thy wrong of me.”
2907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This strook the fair dame with such fear, it took her speech away,"
2908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, shadow’d in her snowy veil, she durst not but obey;"
2909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet, to shun the shame she fear’d, she vanish’d undescried"
2910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Trojan ladies there, for Venus was her guide."
2911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arriv’d at home, her women both fell to their work in haste;"
2912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When she, that was of all her sex the most divinely grac’d,"
2913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ascended to a higher room, though much against her will,"
2914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where lovely Alexander was, being led by Venus still."
2915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The laughter-loving Dame discen’d her mov’d mind by her grace,"
2916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, for her mirth sake, set a stool, full before Paris’ face,"
2917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where she would needs have Helen sit; who, though she durst not choose"
2918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But sit, yet look’d away for all the Goddess’ pow’r could use,"
2919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And used her tongue too, and to chide whom Venus sooth’d so much,"
2920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And chid, too, in this bitter kind: “And was thy cowardice such,"
2921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So conquer’d, to be seen alive? O would to God, thy life"
2922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had perish’d by his worthy hand, to whom I first was wife!"
2923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before this, thou wouldst glorify thy valour and thy lance,"
2924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, past my first love’s, boast them far. Go once more, and advance"
2925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy braves against his single pow’r; this foil might fall by chance.
2926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Poor conquer’d man! ’Twas such a chance, as I would not advise"
2927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy valour should provoke again. Shun him, thou most unwise,"
2928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest next, thy spirit sent to hell, thy body be his prise.”"
2929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: “Pray thee, woman, cease, to chide and grieve me thus."
2930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Disgraces will not ever last. Look on their end. On us
2931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will other Gods, at other times, let fall the victor’s wreath,"
2932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As on him Pallas put it now. Shall our love sink beneath
2933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hate of fortune? In love’s fire, let all hates vanish. Come,"
2934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Love never so inflam’d my heart; no, not when, bringing home"
2935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy beauty’s so delicious prise, on Cranaë’s blest shore"
2936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I long’d for, and enjoy’d thee first.” With this he went before,"
2937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She after, to the odorous bed. While these to pleasure yield,"
2938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Perplex’d Atrides, savage-like, ran up and down the field,"
2939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ev’ry thickest troop of Troy, and of their far-call’d aid,"
2940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Search’d for his foe, who could not be by any eye betray’d;"
2941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor out of friendship (out of doubt) did they conceal his sight,"
2942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All hated him so like their deaths, and ow’d him such despite."
2943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At last thus spake the king of men: “Hear me, ye men of Troy,"
2944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ye Dardans, and the rest, whose pow’rs you in their aids employ."
2945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The conquest on my brother’s part, ye all discern is clear,"
2946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Do you then Argive Helena, with all her treasure here,"
2947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Restore to us, and pay the mulct, that by your vows is due,"
2948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yield us an honour’d recompense, and, all that should accrue"
2949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To our posterities, confirm; that when you render it,"

3066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Father both of men and Gods agreed, and Pallas sent,"
3067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With these wing’d words, to both the hosts: “Make all haste, and invent"
3068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some mean by which the men of Troy, against the truce agreed,"
3069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,May stir the glorious Greeks to arms with some inglorious deed.”
3070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus charg’d he her with haste that did, before, in haste abound,"
3071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who cast herself from all the heights, with which steep heav’n is"
3072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,crown’d.
3073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as Jove, brandishing a star, which men a comet call,"
3074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hurls out his curled hair abroad, that from his brand exhals"
3075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A thousand sparks, to fleets at sea, and ev’ry mighty host,"
3076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all presages and ill-haps a sign mistrusted most;
3077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So Pallas fell ’twixt both the camps, and suddenly was lost,"
3078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When through the breasts of all that saw, she strook a strong amaze"
3079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With viewing, in her whole descent, her bright and ominous blaze."
3080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When straight one to another turn’d, and said: “Now thund’ring Jove"
3081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Great Arbiter of peace and arms) will either stablish love

3083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus either army did presage, when Pallas made her pass"
3084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst the multitude of Troy; who now put on the grace
3085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of brave Laodocus, the flow’r of old Antenor’s race,"
3086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And sought for Lycian Pandarus, a man that, being bred"
3087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out of a faithless family, she thought was fit to shed"
3088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The blood of any innocent, and break the cov’nant sworn;"
3089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He was Lycaon’s son, whom Jove into a wolf did turn"
3090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For sacrificing of a child, and yet in arms renown’d"
3091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As one that was inculpable. Him Pallas standing found,"
3092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And round about him his strong troops that bore the shady shields;
3093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He brought them from Æsepus’ flood, let through the Lycian fields;"
3094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom standing near, she whisper’d thus: “Lycaon’s warlike son,"
3095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall I despair at thy kind hands to have a favour done?
3096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor dar’st thou let an arrow fly upon the Spartan king?
3097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It would be such a grace to Troy, and such a glorious thing,"
3098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That ev’ry man would give his gift; but Alexander’s hand
3099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would load thee with them, if he could discover from his stand"

3101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The flaming heap of funeral. Come, shoot him, princely friend;"
3102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But first invoke the God of Light, that in thy land was born,"
3103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And is in archers’ art the best that ever sheaf hath worn,"
3104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whom a hundred first-ew’d lambs vow thou in holy fire,"
3105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When safe to sacred Zelia’s tow’rs thy zealous steps retire.”
3106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this the mad gift-greedy man Minerva did persuade,"
3107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who instantly drew forth a bow, most admirably made"
3108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of th’ antler of a jumping goat bred in a steep upland,"
3109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which archer-like (as long before he took his hidden stand,"
3110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The evicke skipping from a rock) into the breast he smote,"
3111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And headlong fell’d him from his cliff. The forehead of the goat
3112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Held out a wondrous goodly palm, that sixteen branches brought;"
3113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all which join’d, an useful bow a skilful bowyer wrought,"
3114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which pick’d and polish’d, both the ends he hid with horns of gold."
3115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And this bow, bent, he close laid down, and bad his soldiers hold"
3116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their shields before him, lest the Greeks, discerning him, should rise"
3117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In tumults ere the Spartan king could be his arrow’s prise.
3118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mean space, with all his care he choos’d, and from his quiver drew,"
3119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An arrow, feather’d best for flight and yet that never flew,"
3120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strong headed, and most apt to pierce; then took he up his bow,"
3121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And nock’d his shaft, the ground whence all their future grief did"
3122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,grow.
3123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, praying to his God the Sun, that was in Lycia bred,"
3124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And king of archers, promising that he the blood would shed"
3125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of full an hundred first-fall’n lambs, all offer’d to his name,"
3126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When to Zelia’s sacred walls from rescu’d Troy he came,"
3127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took his arrow by the nock, and to his bended breast[1]"
3128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The oxy sinew close he drew, ev’n till the pile did rest"
3129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon the bosom of the bow; and as that savage prise
3130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His strength constrain’d into an orb, as if the wind did rise"
3131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The coming of it made a noise, the sinew-forgéd string"
3132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did give a mighty twang, and forth the eager shaft did sing,"
3133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Affecting speediness of flight, amongst the Achive throng."
3134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor were the blesséd Heav’nly Pow’rs unmindful of thy wrong,"
3135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O Menelaus, but, in chief, Jove’s seed: the Pillager,"
3136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood close before, and slack’d the force the arrow did confer,"
3137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With as much care and little hurt, as doth a mother use,"
3138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And keep off from her babe, when sleep doth through his pow’rs diffuse"
3139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His golden humour, and th’ assaults of rude and busy flies"
3140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She still checks with her careful hand; for so the shaft she plies
3141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That on the buttons made of gold, which made his girdle fast,"
3142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And where his curets double were, the fall of it she plac’d."
3143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thus much proof she put it to: the buckle made of gold;
3144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The belt it fast’ned, bravely wrought; his curets’ double fold;"
3145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And last, the charméd plate he wore, which help’d him more than all,"
3146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, ’gainst all darts and shafts bestow’d, was to his life a wall;"
3147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So, through all these, the upper skin the head did only race;"
3148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet forth the blood flow’d, which did much his royal person grace,"
3149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And show’d upon his ivory skin, as doth a purple dye"
3150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laid, by a dame of Caïra, or lovely Mæony,"
3151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On ivory, wrought in ornaments to deck the cheeks of horse;"
3152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which in her marriage room must lie; whose beauties have such force
3153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That they are wish’d of many knights, but are such precious things,"
3154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That they are kept for horse that draw the chariots of kings,"
3155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which horse, so deck’d, the charioteer esteems a grace to him;"
3156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like these, in grace, the blood upon thy solid thighs did swim,"
3157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O Menelaus, down by calves and ankles to the ground."
3158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For nothing decks a soldier so, as doth an honour’d wound."
3159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, fearing he had far’d much worse, the hair stood up on end"
3160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On Agamemnon, when he saw so much black blood descend."
3161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And stiff’ned with the like dismay was Menelaus too,"
3162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But seeing th’ arrow’s stale without, and that the head did go"
3163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No further than it might be seen, he call’d his spirits again;"
3164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which Agamemnon marking not but thinking he was slain,"
3165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He grip’d his brother by the hand, and sigh’d as he would break,"
3166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which sigh the whole host took from him, who thus at last did speak:"
3167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O dearest brother, is’t for this, that thy death must be wrought,"
3168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wrought I this truce? For this has thou the single combat fought
3169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all the army of the Greeks? For this hath Ilion sworn,"
3170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And trod all faith beneath their feet? Yet all this hath not worn
3171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The right we challeng’d out of force; this cannot render vain
3172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our stricken right hands, sacred wine, nor all our off’rings slain;"
3173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For though Olympius be not quick in making good our ill,"
3174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He will be sure as he is slow, and sharplier prove his will."
3175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their own hands shall be ministers of those plagues they despise,"
3176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which shall their wives and children reach, and all their progenies."
3177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For both in mind and soul I know, that there shall come a day"
3178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Ilion, Priam, all his pow’r, shall quite be worn away,"
3179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When heav’n-inhabiting Jove shall shake his fiery shield at all,"
3180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For this one mischief. This, I know, the world cannot recall."
3181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But be all this, all my grief still for thee will be the same,"
3182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dear brother. If thy life must here put out his royal flame,"
3183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I shall to sandy Argos turn with infamy my face;
3184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all the Greeks will call for home; old Priam and his race
3185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will flame in glory; Helena untouch’d be still their prey;
3186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thy bones in our enemies’ earth our curséd fates shall lay;
3187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy sepulchre be trodden down; the pride of Troy desire
3188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Insulting on it, ‘Thus, O thus, let Agamemnon’s ire"
3189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all his acts be expiate, as now he carries home"
3190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His idle army, empty ships, and leaves here overcome"
3191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good Menelaus.’ When this rave breaks in their bated breath,"
3192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then let the broad earth swallow me, and take me quick to death.”"
3193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Nor shall this ever chance,” said he, “and therefore be of cheer,"
3194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest all the army, led by you, your passions put in fear."
3195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The arrow fell in no such place a death could enter at,"
3196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My girdle, curets doubled here, and my most trusted plate,"
3197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Objected all ’twixt me and death, the shaft scarce piercing one.”"
3198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Good brother,” said the king, “I wish it were no further gone,"
3199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For then our best in med’cines skilled shall ope and search the wound,"
3200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Applying balms to ease thy pains, and soon restore thee sound.”"
3201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, divine Talthybiús he call’d, and bad him haste"
3202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Machaon (Æsculapius’ son, who most of men was grac’d"
3203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With physic’s sov’reign remedies) to come and lend his hand
3204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Menelaus, shot by one well-skill’d in the command"
3205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of bow and arrows, one of Troy, or of the Lycian aid,"
3206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who much hath glorified our foe, and us as much dismay’d."
3207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He heard, and hasted instantly, and cast his eyes about"
3208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The thickest squadrons of the Greeks, to find Machaon out."
3209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He found him standing guarded well with well-arm’d men of Thrace;
3210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With whom he quickly join’d, and said: “Man of Apollo’s race,"
3211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Haste, for the king of men commands, to see a wound impress’d"
3212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Menelaus, great in arms, by one instructed best"
3213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In th’ art of archery, of Troy, or of the Lycian bands,"
3214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That them with much renown adorns, us with dishonour brands.”"
3215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Machaon much was mov’d with this, who with the herald flew"
3216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From troop to troop alongst the host; and soon they came in view
3217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of hurt Atrides, circled round with all the Grecian kings;"
3218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who all gave way, and straight he draws the shaft, which forth he"
3219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,brings
3220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without the forks; the girdle then, plate, curets, off he plucks,"
3221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And views the wound; when first from it the clotter’d blood he sucks,"
3222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then med’cines, wondrously compos’d, the skilful leech applied,"
3223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which loving Chiron taught his sire, he from his sire had tried."
3224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While these were thus employ’d to ease the Atrean martialist,"
3225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans arm’d, and charg’d the Greeks; the Greeks arm and resist."
3226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then not asleep, nor maz’d with fear, nor shifting off the blows,"
3227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You could behold the king of men, but in full speed he goes"
3228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To set a glorious fight on foot; and he examples this,"
3229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With toiling, like the worst, on foot; who therefore did dismiss"
3230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His brass-arm’d chariot, and his steeds, with Ptolemëus’ son,"
3231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Son of Piraides, their guide, the good Eurymedon;"
3232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Yet,” said the king, “attend with them, lest weariness should seize"
3233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My limbs, surcharg’d with ord’ring troops so thick and vast as these.”"
3234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurymedon then rein’d his horse, that trotted neighing by;"
3235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The king a footman, and so scours the squadrons orderly."
3236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those of his swiftly-mounted Greeks, that in their arms were fit,"
3237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those he put on with cheerful words, and bad them not remit"
3238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The least spark of their forward spirits, because the Trojans durst"
3239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Take these abhorr’d advantages, but let them do their worst;"
3240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For they might be assur’d that Jove would patronise no lies,"
3241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that who, with the breach of truce, would hurt their enemies,"
3242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With vultures should be torn themselves; that they should raze their
3243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"town,"
3244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their wives, and children at their breast, led vassals to their own."
3245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But such as he beheld hang off from that increasing fight,"
3246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such would he bitterly rebuke, and with disgrace excite:"
3247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Base Argives, blush ye not to stand as made for butts to darts?"
3248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Why are ye thus discomfited, like hinds that have no hearts,"
3249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, wearied with a long-run field, are instantly emboss’d,"
3250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stand still, and in their beastly breasts is all their courage lost?"
3251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so stand you strook with amaze, nor dare to strike a stroke."
3252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would ye the foe should nearer yet your dastard spleens provoke,"
3253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n where on Neptune’s foamy shore our navies lie in sight,"
3254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see if Jove will hold your hands, and teach ye how to fight?”"
3255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus he, commanding, rang’d the host, and, passing many a band,"
3256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He came to the Cretensian troops, where all did arméd stand"
3257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About the martial Idomen; who bravely stood before
3258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In vanguard of his troops, and match’d for strength a savage boar;"
3259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Meriones, his charioteer, the rearguard bringing on."
3260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which seen to Atreus’ son, to him it was a sight alone,"
3261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Idomen’s confirméd mind with these kind words he seeks:
3262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Idomen! I ever lov’d thy self past all the Greeks,"
3263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In war, or any work of peace, at table, ev’rywhere;"
3264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For when the best of Greece besides mix ever, at our cheer,"
3265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My good old ardent wine with small, and our inferior mates"
3266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Drink ev’n that mix’d wine measur’d too, thou drink’st, without those"
3267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"rates,"
3268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our old wine neat, and evermore thy bowl stands full like mine,"
3269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To drink still when and what thou wilt. Then rouse that heart of thine,"
3270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, whatsoever heretofore thou hast assum’d to be,"
3271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This day be greater.” To the king in this sort answer’d he:
3272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Atrides, what I ever seem’d, the same at ev’ry part"
3273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This day shall show me at the full, and I will fit thy heart."
3274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thou shouldst rather cheer the rest, and tell them they in right"
3275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all good war must offer blows, and should begin the fight,"
3276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Since Troy first brake the holy truce) and not endure these braves.
3277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To take wrong first, and then be dar’d to the revenge it craves;"
3278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Assuring them that Troy in fate must have the worst at last,"
3279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since first, and ’gainst a truce, they hurt, where they should have"
3280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,embrac’d.”
3281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This comfort and advice did fit Atrides’ heart indeed
3282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who still through new-rais’d swarms of men held his laborious speed,"
3283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And came where both th’ Ajaces stood; whom like the last he found
3284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arm’d, casqu’d, and ready for the fight. Behind them, hid the ground"
3285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A cloud of foot, that seem’d to smoke. And as a goatherd spies,"
3286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On some hill’s top, out of the sea a rainy vapour rise,"
3287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Driv’n by the breath of Zephyrus which, though far off he rest,"
3288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Comes on as black as pitch, and brings a tempest in his breast,"
3289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whereat he frighted, drives his herds apace into a den;"
3290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So dark’ning earth with darts and shields show’d these with all their
3291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,men.
3292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This sight with like joy fir’d the king, who thus let forth the flame"
3293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In crying out to both the dukes: “O you of equal name,"
3294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I must not cheer, nay, I disclaim all my command of you,"
3295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yourselves command with such free minds, and make your soldiers show"
3296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As you nor I led, but themselves. O would our father Jove,"
3297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva, and the God of Light, would all our bodies move"
3298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such brave spirits as breathe in you, then Priam’s lofty town"
3299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should soon be taken by our hands, for ever overthrown!”"
3300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then held he on to other troops, and Nestor next beheld,"
3301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The subtle Pylian orator, range up and down the field"
3302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Embattelling his men at arms, and stirring all to blows,"
3303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Points ev’ry legion out his chief, and ev’ry chief he shows"
3304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The forms and discipline of war, yet his commanders were"
3305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All expert, and renownéd men. Great Pelagon was there,"
3306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alastor, manly Chromius, and Hæmon worth a throne,"
3307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Bias that could armies lead. With these he first put on
3308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His horse troops with their chariots; his foot (of which he choos’d
3309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Many, the best and ablest men, and which he ever us’d"
3310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As rampire to his gen’ral pow’r) he in the rear dispos’d.
3311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The slothful, and the least of spirit, he in the midst inclos’d,"
3312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, such as wanted noble wills, base need might force to stand."
3313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His horse troops, that the vanguard had, he strictly did command"
3314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ride their horses temp’rately, to keep their ranks, and shun"
3315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Confusion, lest their horsemanship and courage made them run"
3316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Too much presum’d on) much too far, and, charging so alone,"
3317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Engage themselves in th’ enemy’s strength, where many fight with one."
3318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Who his own chariot leaves to range, let him not freely go,"
3319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But straight unhorse him with a lance; for ’tis much better so.
3320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And with this discipline,” said he, “this form, these minds, this"
3321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"trust,"
3322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our ancestors have walls and towns laid level with the dust.”
3323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus prompt, and long inur’d to arms, this old man did exhort;"
3324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And this Atrides likewise took in wondrous cheerful sort,"
3325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “O father, would to heav’n, that as thy mind remains"
3326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In wonted vigour, so thy knees could undergo our pains!"
3327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But age, that all men overcomes, hath made his prise on thee;"
3328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet still I wish that some young man, grown old in mind, might be"
3329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put in proportion with thy years, and thy mind, young in age,"
3330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be fitly answer’d with his youth; that still where conflicts rage,"
3331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And young men us’d to thirst for fame, thy brave exampling hand"
3332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Might double our young Grecian spirits, and grace our whole command.”"
3333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The old knight answer’d: “I myself could wish, O Atreus’ son,"
3334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I were as young as when I slew brave Ereuthalion,"
3335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But Gods at all times give not all their gifts to mortal men.
3336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If then I had the strength of youth, I miss’d the counsels then"
3337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That years now give me; and now years want that main strength of youth;
3338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet still my mind retains her strength (as you now said the sooth)
3339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And would be where that strength is us’d, affording counsel sage"
3340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To stir youth’s minds up; ’tis the grace and office of our age;
3341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let younger sinews, men sprung up whole ages after me,"
3342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And such as have strength, use it, and as strong in honour be.”"
3343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The king, all this while comforted, arriv’d next where he found"
3344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Well-rode Menestheus (Peteus’ son) stand still, inviron’d round"
3345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his well-train’d Athenian troops, and next to him he spied"
3346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wise Ulysses, deedless too, and all his bands beside"
3347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of strong Cephalians; for as yet th’ alarm had not been heard
3348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all their quarters, Greece and Troy were then so newly stirr’d,"
3349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then first mov’d, as they conceiv’d; and they so look’d about"
3350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To see both hosts give proof of that they yet had cause to doubt.
3351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Atrides seeing them stand so still, and spend their eyes at gaze,"
3352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Began to chide: “And why,” said he, “dissolv’d thus in amaze,"
3353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou son of Peteus, Jove-nurs’d king, and thou in wicked sleight"
3354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A cunning soldier, stand ye off? Expect ye that the fight"
3355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should be by other men begun? ’Tis fit the foremost band
3356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should show you there; you first should front who first lifts up his
3357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,hand.
3358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First you can hear, when I invite the princes to a feast,"
3359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When first, most friendly, and at will, ye eat and drink the best,"
3360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet in the fight, most willingly, ten troops ye can behold"
3361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Take place before ye.” Ithacus at this his brows did fold,"
3362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “How hath thy violent tongue broke through thy set of teeth,"
3363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To say that we are slack in fight, and to the field of death"
3364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Look others should enforce our way, when we were busied then,"
3365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n when thou spak’st, against the foe to cheer and lead our men?"
3366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thy eyes shall be witnesses, if it content thy will,"
3367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that (as thou pretend’st) these cares do so affect thee still,"
3368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The father of Telemachus (whom I esteem so dear,"
3369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to whom, as a legacy, I’ll leave my deeds done here)"
3370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n with the foremost band of Troy hath his encounter dar’d,"
3371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore are thy speeches vain, and had been better spar’d.”"
3372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, smiling, since he saw him mov’d, recall’d his words, and said:"
3373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Most generous Laertes’ son, most wise of all our aid,"
3374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I neither do accuse thy worth, more than thyself may hold"
3375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fit, (that inferiors think not much, being slack, to be controll’d)"
3376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor take I on me thy command; for well I know thy mind
3377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Knows how sweet gentle counsels are, and that thou stand’st inclin’d,"
3378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As I myself, for all our good. On then; if now we spake"
3379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What hath displeas’d, another time we full amends will make;"
3380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Gods grant that thy virtue ere may prove so free and brave,"
3381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That my reproofs may still be vain, and thy deservings grave.”"
3382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus parted they; and forth he went, when he did leaning find,"
3383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against his chariot, near his horse, him with the mighty mind,"
3384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Diomedes, Tydeus’ son, and Sthenelus, the seed"
3385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Capaneius; whom the king seeing likewise out of deed,"
3386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus cried he out on Diomed: “O me! In what a fear
3387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wise great warrior, Tydeus’ son, stands gazing ev’rywhere"
3388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For others to begin the fight! It was not Tydeus’ use
3389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To be so daunted, whom his spirit would evermore produce"
3390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before the foremost of his friends in these affairs of fright,"
3391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As they report that have beheld him labour in a fight.
3392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For me, I never knew the man, nor in his presence came,"
3393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But excellent, above the rest, he was in gen’ral fame;"
3394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And one renown’d exploit of his, I am assur’d, is true."
3395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He came to the Mycenian court, without arms, and did sue,"
3396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At godlike Polynices’ hands, to have some worthy aid"
3397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To their designs that ’gainst the walls of sacred Thebes were laid.
3398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He was great Polynices’ guest, and nobly entertain’d,"
3399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And of the kind Mycenian state what he requested gain’d,"
3400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In mere consent; but when they should the same in act approve,"
3401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By some sinister prodigies, held out to them by Jove,"
3402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They were discourag’d. Thence he went, and safely had his pass"
3403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Back to Asopus’ flood, renown’d for bulrushes and grass."
3404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, once more, their ambassador, the Grecian peers address"
3405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lord Tydeus to Eteocles; to whom being giv’n access,"
3406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He found him feasting with a crew of Cadmeans in his hall;
3407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst whom, though an enemy, and only one to all;"
3408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all yet he his challenge made at ev’ry martial feat,"
3409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And eas’ly foil’d all, since with him Minerva was so great."
3410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rank-rode Cadmeans, much incens’d with their so foul disgrace,"
3411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lodg’d ambuscadoes for their foe, in some well-chosen place"
3412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By which he was to make return. Twice five-and-twenty men,"
3413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And two of them great captains too, the ambush did contain."
3414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The names of those two men of rule were Mæon, Hæmon’s son,"
3415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Lycophontes, Keep-field call’d, the heir of Autophon,"
3416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By all men honour’d like the Gods; yet these and all their friends
3417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were sent to hell by Tydeus’ hand, and had untimely ends."
3418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He trusting to the aid of Gods, reveal’d by augury,"
3419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Obeying which, one chief he sav’d, and did his life apply"
3420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To be the heavy messenger of all the others’ deaths;
3421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that sad message, with his life, to Mæon he bequeaths."
3422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So brave a knight was Tydeüs of whom a son is sprung,"
3423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Inferior far in martial deeds, though higher in his tongue.”"
3424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All this Tydides silent heard, aw’d by the rev’rend king;"
3425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which stung hot Sthenelus with wrath, who thus put forth his sting:"
3426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Atrides, when thou know’st the truth, speak what thy knowledge is,"
3427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And do not lie so; for I know and I will brag in this,"
3428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That we are far more able men than both our fathers were.
3429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We took the sev’n-fold ported Thebes, when yet we had not there"
3430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So great help as our fathers had; and fought beneath a wall,"
3431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sacred to Mars, by help of Jove, and trusting to the fall"
3432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of happy signs from other Gods, by whom we took the town"
3433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Untouch’d; our fathers perishing here by follies of their own;
3434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore never more compare our fathers’ worth with ours.”
3435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tydides frown’d at this, and said: “Suppress thine anger’s pow’rs,"
3436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good friend, and hear why I refrain’d. Thou seest I am not mov’d"
3437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against our gen’ral, since he did but what his place behov’d,"
3438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Admonishing all Greeks to fight; for, if Troy prove our prise,"
3439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The honour and the joy is his; if here our ruin lies,"
3440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The shame and grief for that as much is his in greatest kinds.
3441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As he then his charge, weigh we ours; which is our dauntless minds.”"
3442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus, from his chariot, amply arm’d, he jump’d down to the ground;"
3443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The armour of the angry king so horribly did sound,"
3444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It might have made his bravest foe let fear take down his braves.
3445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as when with the west-wind flaws, the sea thrusts up her waves,"
3446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One after other, thick and high, upon the groaning shores,"
3447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First in herself loud, but oppos’d with banks and rocks she roars,"
3448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, all her back in bristles set, spits ev’ry way her foam;"
3449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So, after Diomed, instantly the field was overcome"
3450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With thick impressions of the Greeks; and all the noise that grew
3451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Ord’ring and cheering up their men) from only leaders flew.
3452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rest went silently away, you could not hear a voice,"
3453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor would have thought, in all their breasts, they had one in their"
3454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"choice,"
3455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their silence uttering their awe of them that them controll’d,"
3456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which made each man keep right his arms, march, fight still where he"
3457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,should
3458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans (like a sort of ewes, penn’d in a rich man’s fold,"
3459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close at his door, till all be milk’d, and never baaing hold"
3460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hearing the bleating of their lambs) did all their wide host fill
3461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With shouts and clamours, nor observ’d one voice, one baaing still,"
3462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But show’d mix’d tongues from many a land of men call’d to their aid.
3463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rude Mars had th’ ordering of their spirits; of Greeks, the learned"
3464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Maid
3465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Terror follow’d both the hosts, and Flight, and furious Strife"
3466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sister, and the mate, of Mars, that spoil of human life;"
3467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And never is her rage at rest, at first she is but small,"
3468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet after, but a little fed, she grows so vast and tall"
3469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, while her feet move here in earth, her forehead is in heav’n;"
3470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And this was she that made ev’n then both hosts so deadly giv’n.
3471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through ev’ry troop she stalk’d, and stirr’d rough sighs up as she"
3472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,went;
3473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when in one field both the foes her fury did content,"
3474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And both came under reach of darts, then darts and shields oppos’d"
3475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To darts and shields; strength answer’d strength; then swords and
3476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,targets clos’d
3477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With swords and targets; both with pikes; and then did tumult rise
3478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up to her height; then conqu’rors’ boasts mix’d with the conquer’d’s
3479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,cries;
3480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Earth flow’d with blood. And as from hills rainwaters headlong fall,"
3481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That all ways eat huge ruts, which, met in one bed, fill a vall"
3482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such a confluence of streams, that on the mountain grounds"
3483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Far off, in frighted shepherds’ ears, the bustling noise rebounds:"
3484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So grew their conflicts, and so show’d their scuffling to the ear,"
3485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With flight and clamour still commix’d, and all effects of fear."
3486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And first renown’d Antilochus slew (fighting, in the face"
3487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all Achaia’s foremost bands, with an undaunted grace)"
3488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Echepolus Thalysiades; he was an arméd man;
3489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom on his hair-plum’d helmet’s crest the dart first smote, then ran"
3490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Into his forehead, and there stuck; the steel pile making way"
3491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Quite through his skull; a hasty night shut up his latest day.
3492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fall was like a fight-rac’d tow’r; like which lying there dispread,"
3493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"King Elephenor (who was son to Chalcodon, and led"
3494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The valiant Abants) covetous that he might first possess
3495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His arms, laid hands upon his feet, and hal’d him from the press"
3496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of darts and jav’lins hurl’d at him. The action of the king
3497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When great-in-heart Agenor saw, he made his jav’lin sing"
3498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To th’ others’ labour; and along as he the trunk did wrest,"
3499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His side (at which he bore his shield) in bowing of his breast
3500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lay naked, and receiv’d the lance, that made him lose his hold"
3501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And life together; which, in hope of that he lost, he sold,"
3502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But for his sake the fight grew fierce, the Trojans and their foes"
3503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like wolves on one another rush’d, and man for man it goes."
3504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The next of name, that serv’d his fate, great Ajax Telamon"
3505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Preferr’d so sadly. He was heir to old Anthemion,"
3506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And deck’d with all the flow’r of youth; the fruit of which yet fled,"
3507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before the honour’d nuptial torch could light him to his bed.
3508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His name was Simoisius; for, some few years before,"
3509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mother walking down the hill of Ida, by the shore"
3510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of silver Simois, to see her parents’ flocks, with them"
3511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She, feeling suddenly the pains of child-birth, by the stream"
3512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of that bright river brought him forth; and so (of Simois)
3513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They call’d him Simoisius. Sweet was that birth of his
3514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his kind parents, and his growth did all their care employ;"
3515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet those rites of piety, that should have been his joy"
3516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To pay their honour’d years again in as affectionate sort,"
3517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He could not graciously perform, his sweet life was so short,"
3518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cut off with mighty Ajax’ lance; for, as his spirit put on,"
3519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He strook him at his breast’s right pap, quite through his"
3520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"shoulder-bone,"
3521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in the dust of earth he fell, that was the fruitful soil"
3522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his friends’ hopes; but where he sow’d he buried all his toil.
3523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as a poplar shot aloft, set by a river side,"
3524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In moist edge of a mighty fen, his head in curls implied,"
3525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But all his body plain and smooth, to which a wheel-wright puts"
3526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sharp edge of his shining axe, and his soft timber cuts"
3527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From his in native root, in hope to hew out of his bole"
3528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fell’ffs, or out-parts of a wheel, that compass in the whole,"
3529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To serve some goodly chariot; but, being big and sad,"
3530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to be hal’d home through the bogs, the useful hope he had"
3531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sticks there, and there the goodly plant lies with’ring out his grace:"
3532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So lay, by Jove-bred Ajax’ hand, Anthemion’s forward race,"
3533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor could through that vast fen of toils be drawn to serve the ends
3534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Intended by his body’s pow’rs, nor cheer his aged friends."
3535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But now the gay-arm’d Antiphus, a son of Priam, threw"
3536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His lance at Ajax through the prease; which went by him, and flew"
3537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On Leucus, wise Ulysses’ friend; his groin it smote, as fain"
3538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He would have drawn into his spoil the carcass of the slain,"
3539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By which he fell, and that by him; it vex’d Ulysses’ heart,"
3540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who thrust into the face of fight, well-arm’d at ev’ry part,"
3541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Came close, and look’d about to find an object worth his lance;"
3542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which when the Trojans saw him shake, and he so near advance,"
3543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All shrunk; he threw, and forth it shin’d, nor fell but where it"
3544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,fell’d;
3545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His friend’s grief gave it angry pow’r, and deadly way it held"
3546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon Democoon, who was sprung of Priam’s wanton force,"
3547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Came from Abydus, and was made the master of his horse."
3548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through both his temples strook the dart, the wood of one side shew’d,"
3549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The pile out of the other look’d, and so the earth he strew’d"
3550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With much sound of his weighty arms. Then back the foremost went;
3551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n Hector yielded; then the Greeks gave worthy clamours vent,"
3552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Effecting then their first-dumb pow’rs; some drew the dead, and"
3553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"spoil’d,"
3554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some follow’d, that, in open flight, Troy might confess it foil’d."
3555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apollo, angry at the sight, from top of Ilion cried:"
3556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Turn head, ye well-rode peers of Troy, feed not the Grecians’ pride,"
3557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They are not charm’d against your points, of steel, nor iron, fram’d;"
3558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor fights the fair-hair’d Thetis’ son, but sits at fleet inflam’d.”"
3559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So spake the dreadful God from Troy. The Greeks, Jove’s noblest Seed"
3560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Encourag’d to keep on the chace; and, where fit spirit did need,"
3561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She gave it, marching in the midst. Then flew the fatal hour"
3562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Back on Diores, in return of Ilion’s sun-burn’d pow’r;"
3563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Diores Amaryncides, whose right leg’s ankle-bone,"
3564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And both the sinews, with a sharp and handful-charging stone"
3565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pirus Imbrasides did break, that led the Thracian bands"
3566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And came from Ænos; down he fell, and up he held his hands"

3874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And scorn the help-tire of a horse. I will not blow the fire
3875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of their hot valours with my flight, but cast upon the blaze"
3876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This body borne upon my knees. I entertain amaze?
3877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva will not see that shame. And since they have begun,"
3878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They shall not both elect their ends; and he that ’scapes shall  run,"
3879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or stay and take the other’s fate. And this I leave for thee;—
3880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If amply-wise Athenia give both their lives to me,"
3881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rein our horse to their chariot hard, and have a special heed"
3882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To seize upon Æneas’ steeds, that we may change their breed,"
3883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And make a Grecian race of them that have been long of Troy.
3884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For these are bred of those brave beasts which, for the lovely boy"
3885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That waits now on the cup of Jove, Jove, that far-seeing God,"
3886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Gave Tros the king in recompense; the best that ever trod
3887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sounding centre, underneath the morning and the sun."
3888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Anchises stole the breed of them; for, where their sires did run,"
3889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He closely put his mares to them, and never made it known"
3890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To him that heir’d them, who was then the king Laomedon."
3891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Six horses had he of that race, of which himself kept four,"
3892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And gave the other two his son; and these are they that scour
3893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The field so bravely towards us, expert in charge and flight."
3894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If these we have the pow’r to take, our prise is exquisite,"
3895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And our renown will far exceed.” While these were talking thus,"
3896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fir’d horse brought th’ assailants near, and thus spake Pandarus:"
3897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Most suff’ring-minded Tydeus’ son, that hast of war the art,"
3898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My shaft, that strook thee, slew thee not, I now will prove a dart.”"
3899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he shook, and then he threw, a lance, aloft and large,"
3900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That in Tydides’ curets stuck, quite driving through his targe;"
3901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then bray’d he out so wild a voice that all the field might hear:
3902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Now have I reach’d thy root of life, and by thy death shall bear"
3903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our praise’s chief prise from the field.” Tydides undismay’d
3904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Replied: “Thou err’st, I am not touch’d; but more charge will be laid"
3905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To both your lives before you part; at least the life of one
3906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall satiate the throat of Mars.” This said, his lance was gone,"
3907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva led it to his face, which at his eye ran in,"
3908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, as he stoop’d, strook through his jaws, his tongue’s root, and his"
3909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,chin.
3910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down from the chariot he fell, his gay arms shin’d and rung,"
3911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The swift horse trembled, and his soul for ever charm’d his tongue."
3912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Æneas with his shield, and lance, leapt swiftly to his friend,"
3913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Afraid the Greeks would force his trunk; and that he did defend,"
3914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bold as a lion of his strength; he hid him with his shield,"
3915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shook round his lance, and horribly did threaten all the field"
3916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With death, if any durst make in. Tydides rais’d a stone"
3917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his one hand, of wondrous weight, and pour’d it mainly on"
3918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hip of Anchisiades, wherein the joint doth move"
3919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The thigh (’tis call’d the huckle-bone) which all in sherds it drove,"
3920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brake both the nerves, and with the edge cut all the flesh away."
3921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It stagger’d him upon his knees, and made th’ heroë stay"
3922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His strook-blind temples on his hand, his elbow on the earth;"
3923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And there this prince of men had died, if She that gave him birth,"
3924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Kiss’d by Anchises on the green, where his fair oxen fed)"
3925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove’s loving daughter, instantly had not about him spread"
3926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her soft embraces, and convey’d within her heav’nly veil"
3927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Us’d as a rampire ’gainst all darts that did so hot assail)
3928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her dear-lov’d issue from the field, Then Sthenelus in haste,"
3929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rememb’ring what his friend advis’d, from forth the prease made fast"
3930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His own horse to their chariot, and presently laid hand"
3931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon the lovely-coated horse Æneas did command.
3932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which bringing to the wond’nng Greeks, he did their guard commend"
3933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his belov’d Deipylus, who was his inward friend,"
3934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, of his equals, one to whom he had most honour shown,"
3935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That he might see them safe at fleet; then stept he to his own.
3936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With which he cheerfully made in to Tydeus’ mighty race,"
3937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, mad with his great enemy’s rape, was hot in desp’rate chace"
3938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of her that made it, with his lance, arm’d less with steel than spite,"
3939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Well knowing her no Deity that had to do in fight,"
3940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva his great patroness, nor, She that raceth towns,"
3941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bellona, but a goddess weak, and foe to men’s renowns."
3942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her, through a world of fight pursu’d, at last he overtook,"
3943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, thrusting up his ruthless lance, her heav’nly veil he strook"
3944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(That ev’n the Graces wrought themselves, at her divine command)"
3945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Quite through, and hurt the tender back of her delicious hand."
3946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rude point piercing through her palm, forth flow’d th’ immortal"
3947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,blood;
3948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Blood, such as flows in blesséd Gods, that eat no human food,"
3949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor drink of our inflaming wine, and therefore bloodless are,"
3950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And call’d Immortals; out she cried, and could no longer bear"
3951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her lov’d son; whom she cast from her, and in a sable cloud"
3952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Phœbus, receiving, hid him close from all the Grecian crowd,"
3953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest some of them should find his death. Away flew Venus then,"
3954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And after her cried Diomed: “Away, thou spoil of men,"
3955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though sprung from all-preserving Jove, these hot encounters leave."
3956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is’t not enough that silly dames thy sorc’ries should deceive,"
3957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unless thou thrust into the war, and rob a soldier’s right?"
3958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I think a few of these assaults will make thee fear the fight,"
3959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wherever thou shalt hear it nam’d.” She, sighing, went her way"
3960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Extremely griev’d, and with her griefs her beauties did decay,"
3961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And black her ivory body grew. Then from a dewy mist
3962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brake swift-foot Iris to her aid, from all the darts that hiss’d"
3963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At her quick rapture; and to Mars they took their plaintive course,"
3964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And found him on the fight’s left hand, by him his speedy horse,"
3965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And huge lance, lying in a fog. The Queen of all things fair"
3966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her lovéd brother, on her knees, besought, with instant pray’r,"
3967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His golden-riband-bound-man’d horse to lend her up to heav’n
3968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For she was much griev’d with a wound a mortal man had giv’n,"
3969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tydides, that ’gainst Jove himself durst now advance his arm."
3970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He granted, and his chariot (perplex’d with her late harm)"
3971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She mounted, and her waggoness was She that paints the air."
3972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The horse she rein’d, and with a scourge importun’d their repair,"
3973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That of themselves out-flew the wind, and quickly they ascend"
3974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Olympus, high seat of the Gods. Th’ horse knew their journey’s end,"
3975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood still, and from their chariot the windy-footed dame"
3976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dissolv’d, and gave them heav’nly food; and to Dione came"
3977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her wounded daughter, bent her knees. She kindly bade her stand,"
3978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With sweet embraces help’d her up, strok’d her with her soft hand,"
3979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call’d kindly by her name, and ask’d: “What God hath been so rude,"
3980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sweet daughter, to chastise thee thus, as if thou wert pursu’d"
3981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n to the act of some light sin, and deprehended so?"
3982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For otherwise, each close escape is in the great let go.”"
3983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She answer’d: “Haughty Tydeus’ son hath been so insolent,"
3984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since, him whom most my heart esteems of all my lov’d descent,"
3985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I rescu’d from his bloody hand. Now battle is not giv’n
3986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To any Trojans by the Greeks, but by the Greeks to heav’n.”"
3987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She answer’d: “Daughter, think not much, though much it grieve thee;"
3988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,use
3989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The patience, whereof many Gods examples may produce,"
3990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In many bitter ills receiv’d, as well that men sustain"
3991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By their inflictions as by men repaid to them again.
3992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mars suffer’d much more than thyself by Ephialtes’ pow’r,"
3993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Otus’, Aloëus’ sons; who in a brazen tow’r,"
3994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in inextricable chains, cast that war-greedy God,"
3995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where twice-six months and one he liv’d, and there the period"
3996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his sad life perhaps had clos’d, if his kind step-dame’s eye,"
3997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair Erebæa, had not seen; who told it Mercury,"
3998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And he by stealth enfranchis’d him; though he could scarce enjoy
3999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The benefit of franchisement, the chains did so destroy"
4000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His vital forces with their weight. So Juno suffer’d more
4001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, with a three-fork’d arrow’s head, Amphitryo’s son did gore"
4002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her right breast, past all hope of cure. Pluto sustain’d no less"
4003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By that self man, and by a shaft of equal bitterness"
4004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shot through his shoulder at hell gates; and there, amongst the dead,"
4005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were he not deathless, he had died; but up to heav’n he fled,"
4006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Extremely tortur’d, for recure, which instantly he won"
4007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At Pæon’s hand, with sov’reign balm; and this did Jove’s great son,"
4008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unblest, great-high-deed-daring man, that car’d not doing ill,"
4009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That with his bow durst wound the Gods! But, by Minerva’s will,"
4010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy wound the foolish Diomed was so profane to give;
4011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not knowing he that fights with Heav’n hath never long to live,"
4012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And for this deed, he never shall have child about his knee"
4013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To call him father, coming home. Besides, hear this from me,"
4014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strength-trusting man, though thou be strong, and art in strength a"
4015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"tow’r,"
4016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Take heed a stronger meet thee not, and that a woman’s pow’r"
4017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Contains not that superior strength, and lest that woman be"
4018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Adrastus’ daughter, and thy wife, the wise Ægiale;"
4019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, from this hour not far, she wakes, ev’n sighing with desire"
4020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To kindle our revenge on thee, with her enamouring fire,"
4021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In choosing her some fresh young friend, and so drown all thy fame,"
4022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Won here in war, in her court-piece, and in an opener shame.”"
4023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, with both her hands she cleans’d the tender back and palm"
4024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the sacred blood they lost; and, never using balm,"
4025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The pain ceas’d, and the wound was cur’d of this kind Queen of love."
4026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Juno and Pallas, seeing this, assay’d to anger Jove,"
4027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And quit his late-made mirth with them, about the loving Dame,"
4028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With some sharp jest, in like sort, built upon her present shame."
4029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gray-ey’d Athenia began, and ask’d the Thunderer,"
4030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If, nothing moving him to wrath, she boldly might prefer,"
4031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What she conceiv’d, to his conceit; and, staying no reply,"
4032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She bade him view the Cyprian fruit he lov’d so tenderly,"
4033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom she thought hurt, and by this means;—intending to suborn"
4034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some other lady of the Greeks (whom lovely veils adorn)
4035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To gratify some other friend of her much-lovéd Troy,"
4036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As she embrac’d and stirr’d her blood to the Venerean joy,"
4037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The golden clasp, those Grecian dames upon their girdles wear,"
4038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took hold of her delicious hand, and hurt it, she had fear."
4039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Thund’rer smil’d, and call’d to him love’s golden Arbitress,"
4040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And told her those rough works of war were not for her access;
4041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She should be making marriages, embracings, kisses, charms,"
4042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Stern Mars and Pallas had the charge of those affairs in arms.
4043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While these thus talk’d, Tydides’ rage still thirsted to achieve"
4044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His prise upon Anchises’ son, though well he did perceive"
4045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Sun himself protected him; but his desires (inflam’d
4046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With that great Trojan prince’s blood, and arms so highly fam’d)"
4047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not that great God did reverence. Thrice rush’d he rudely on,"
4048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thrice, betwixt his darts and death, the Sun’s bright target shone;"
4049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when upon the fourth assault, much like a spirit, he flew,"
4050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The far-off-working Deity exceeding wrathful grew,"
4051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ask’d him: “What! Not yield to gods? Thy equals learn to know.
4052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The race of Gods is far above men creeping here below.”
4053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This drave him to some small retreat; he would not tempt more near
4054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wrath of him that strook so far; whose pow’r had now set clear
4055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Æneas from the stormy field within the holy place
4056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Pergamus, where, to the hope of his so sov’reign grace,"
4057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A goodly temple was advanc’d; in whose large inmost part
4058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He left him, and to his supply inclin’d his mother’s heart,"
4059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Latona, and the dart-pleas’d Queen; who cur’d, and made him strong."
4060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The silver-bow’d fair God then threw in the tumultuous throng
4061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An image, that in stature, look, and arms, he did create"
4062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like Venus’ son; for which the Greeks and Trojans made debate,"
4063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laid loud strokes on their ox-hide shields, and bucklers eas’ly borne;"
4064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which error Phœbus pleas’d to urge on Mars himself in scorn:
4065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Mars, Mars,” said he, “thou plague of men, smear’d with the dust and"
4066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,blood
4067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of humans, and their ruin’d walls, yet thinks thy Godhead good"
4068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fright this fury from the field, who next will fight with Jove?"
4069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First in a bold approach he hurt, the moist palm of thy love,"
4070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And next, as if he did affect to have a Deity’s pow’r,"
4071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He held out his assault on me.” This said, the lofty tow’r"
4072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Pergamus he made his seat; and Mars did now excite
4073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojan forces, in the form of him that led to fight"
4074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Thracian troops, swift Acamas. “O Priam’s sons,” said he,"
4075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“How long the slaughter of your men can ye sustain to see?
4076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n till they brave you at your gates? Ye suffer beaten down
4077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Æneas, great Anchises’ son, whose prowess we renown"
4078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As much as Hector’s; fetch him off from this contentious prease.”
4079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this, the strength and spirits of all his courage did increase;"
4080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet Sarpedon seconds him, with this particular taunt"
4081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of noble Hector: “Hector, where is thy unthankful vaunt,"
4082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that huge strength on which it built, that thou, and thy allies,"
4083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all thy brothers (without aid of us or our supplies,"
4084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And troubling not a citizen) the city safe would hold?
4085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all which friends’ and brothers’ helps I see not, nor am told"
4086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of anyone of their exploits, but (all held in dismay"
4087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Diomed, like a sort of dogs, that at a lion bay,"
4088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And entertain no spirit to pinch) we, your assistants here,"
4089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fight for the town as you help’d us; and I, an aiding peer,"
4090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No citizen, ev’n out of care, that doth become a man"
4091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For men and children’s liberties, add all the aid I can;"
4092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not out of my particular cause; far hence my profit grows,"
4093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For far hence Asian Lycia lies, where gulfy Xanthus flows,"
4094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And where my lov’d wife, infant son, and treasure nothing scant,"
4095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I left behind me, which I see those men would have that want,"
4096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore they that have would keep. Yet I, as I would lose"
4097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their sure fruition, cheer my troops, and with their lives propose"
4098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mine own life, both to gen’ral fight, and to particular cope"
4099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this great soldier; though, I say, I entertain no hope"
4100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To have such gettings as the Greeks, nor fear to lose like Troy."
4101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet thou, ev’n Hector, deedless stand’st, and car’st not to employ"
4102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy town-born friends, to bid them stand, to fight and save their"
4103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"wives,"
4104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lest as a fowler casts his nets upon the silly lives
4105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of birds of all sorts, so the foe your walls and houses hales,"
4106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One with another, on all heads; or such as ’scape their falls,"
4107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He made the prey and prise of them (as willing overthrown)
4108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That hope not for you with their force; and so this brave-built town
4109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will prove a chaos. That deserves in thee so hot a care,"
4110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As should consume thy days and nights, to hearten and prepare"
4111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Th’ assistant princes; pray their minds to bear their far-brought
4112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,toils;
4113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To give them worth with worthy fight; in victories and foils
4114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still to be equal; and thyself, exampling them in all,"
4115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Need no reproofs nor spurs. All this in thy free choice should fall.”
4116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This stung great Hector’s heart; and yet, as ev’ry gen’rous mind"
4117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should silent bear a just reproof, and show what good they find"
4118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In worthy counsels, by their ends put into present deeds,"
4119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not stomach nor be vainly sham’d; so Hector’s spirit proceeds,"
4120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And from his chariot, wholly arm’d, he jump’d upon the sand,"
4121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On foot so toiling through the host, a dart in either hand,"
4122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all hands turn’d against the Greeks. The Greeks despis’d their
4123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"worst,"
4124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, thick’ning their instructed pow’rs, expected all they durst."
4125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then with the feet of horse and foot, the dust in clouds did rise."
4126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as, in sacred floors of barns, upon corn-winnow’rs flies"
4127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The chaff, driv’n with an opposite wind, when yellow Ceres dites,"
4128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which all the diters’ feet, legs, arms, their heads and shoulders"

4130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So look’d the Grecians gray with dust, that strook the solid heav’n,"
4131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rais’d from returning chariots, and troops together driv’n."
4132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Each side stood to their labours firm. Fierce Mars flew through the
4133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"air,"
4134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And gather’d darkness from the fight, and, with his best affair,"
4135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Obey’d the pleasure of the Sun, that wears the golden sword"
4136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who bade him raise the spirits of Troy, when Pallas ceas’d t’ afford"
4137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her helping office to the Greeks; and then his own hands wrought,"
4138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, from his fane’s rich chancel, cur’d, the true Æneas brought,"
4139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And plac’d him by his peers in field; who did with joy admire
4140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see him both alive and safe, and all his pow’rs entire"
4141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet stood not sifting how it chanc’d; another sort of task,"
4142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then stirring th’ idle sieve of news, did all their forces ask,"
4143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Inflam’d by Phœbus, harmful Mars, and Eris eag’rer far."
4144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Greeks had none to hearten them; their hearts rose with the war;
4145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But chiefly Diomed, Ithacus, and both th’ Ajaces us’d"
4146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Stirring examples and good words; their own fames had infus’d
4147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Spirit enough into their bloods, to make them neither fear"
4148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans’ force, nor Fate itself, but still expecting were,"
4149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When most was done, what would be more; their ground they still made good,"
4150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in their silence, and set pow’rs, like fair still clouds, they"
4151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"stood,"
4152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With which Jove crowns the tops of hills, in any quiet day,"
4153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When Boreas and the ruder winds (that use to drive away
4154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Air’s dusky vapours, being loose, in many a whistling gale)"
4155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are pleasingly bound up, and calm, and not a breath exhale;"
4156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So firmly stood the Greeks, nor fled for all the Ilion’s aid."
4157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Atrides yet coasts through the troops, confirming men so staid:"
4158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O friends,” said he, “hold up your minds; strength is but strength of will;"
4159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rev’rence each other’s good in fight and shame at things done ill.
4160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where soldiers show an honest shame, and love of honour lives,"
4161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That ranks men with the first in fight, death fewer liveries gives"
4162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than life, or than where Fame’s neglect makes cowards fight at length."
4163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flight neither doth the body grace, nor shows the mind hath strength.”"
4164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He said, and swiftly through the troops a mortal lance did send,"
4165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That reft a standard-bearer’s life, renown’d Æneas’ friend,"
4166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deïcoon Pergasides, whom all the Trojans lov’d"
4167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As he were one of Priam’s sons, his mind was so approv’d"
4168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In always fighting with the first. The lance his target took,"
4169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which could not interrupt the blow, that through it clearly strook,"
4170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in his belly’s rim was sheath’d, beneath his girdle-stead."
4171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He sounded falling, and his arms with him resounded, dead."
4172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then fell two princes of the Greeks by great Æneas’ ire,"
4173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Diocleus’ sons (Orsilochus and Crethon), whose kind sire"
4174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In bravely-builded Phæra dwelt, rich, and of sacred blood."
4175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He was descended lineally from great Alphæus’ flood,"
4176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That broadly flows through Pyles’ fields; Alphæus did beget
4177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Orsilochus, who in the rule of many men was set;"
4178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And that Orsilochus begat the rich Diocleüs;
4179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Diocleus sire to Crethon was, and this Orsilochus."
4180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both these; arriv’d at man’s estate, with both th’ Atrides went,"
4181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To honour them in th’ Ilion wars; and both were one day sent,"
4182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To death as well as Troy, for death hid both in one black hour."
4183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As two young lions (with their dam, sustain’d but to devour)"
4184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bred on the tops of some steep hill, and in the gloomy deep"
4185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of an inaccessible wood, rush out, and prey on sheep,"
4186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Steers, oxen, and destroy men’s stalls, so long that they come short,"
4187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And by the owner’s steel are slain; in such unhappy sort
4188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fell these beneath Æneas’ pow’r. When Menelaus view’d
4189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like two tall fir-trees these two fall, their timeless falls he rued,"
4190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to the first fight, where they lay, a vengeful force he took;"
4191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His arms beat back the sun in flames, a dreadful lance he shook;"
4192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mars put the fury in his mind, that by Æneas’ hands,"
4193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who was to make the slaughter good, he might have strew’d the sands."
4194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antilochus, old Nestor’s son, observing he was bent"
4195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To urge a combat of such odds, and knowing, the event"
4196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being ill on his part, all their pains (alone sustain’d for him)"
4197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Err’d from their end, made after hard, and took them in the trim"
4198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of an encounter. Both their hands and darts advanc’d, and shook,"
4199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And both pitch’d in full stand of charge; when suddenly the look
4200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Anchisiades took note of Nestor’s valiant son,"
4201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In full charge too; which, two to one, made Venus’ issue shun"
4202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hot adventure, though he were a soldier well-approv’d."
4203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then drew they off their slaughter’d friends; who giv’n to their
4204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"belov’d,"
4205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They turn’d where fight show’d deadliest hate; and there mix’d with the
4206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,dead
4207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pylæmen, that the targeteers of Paphlagonia led,"
4208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A man like Mars; and with him fell good Mydon that did guide
4209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His chariot, Atymnus’ son. The prince Pylæmen died"
4210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By Menelaus; Nestor’s joy slew Mydon; one before
4211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The other in the chariot. Atrides’ lance did gore
4212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pylæmen’s shoulder, in the blade. Antilochus did force"
4213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A mighty stone up from the earth, and, as he turn’d his horse,"
4214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Strook Mydon’s elbow in the midst; the reins of ivory
4215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fell from his hands into the dust; Antilochus let fly
4216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sword withal, and, rushing in, a blow so deadly laid"
4217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon his temples, that he groan’d, tumbled to earth, and stay’d"
4218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A mighty while preposterously (because the dust was deep)
4219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon his neck and shoulders there, ev’n till his foe took keep"
4220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his pris’d horse, and made them stir; and then he prostrate fell."
4221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His horse Antilochus took home. When Hector had heard tell,"
4222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the uproar, of their deaths, he laid out all his voice,"
4223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ran upon the Greeks. Behind came many men of choice,"
4224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before him march’d great Mars himself match’d with his female mate,"
4225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The dread Bellona. She brought on, to fight for mutual fate,"
4226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A tumult that was wild and mad. He shook a horrid lance,"
4227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now led Hector, and anon behind would make the chance."
4228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This sight when great Tydides saw, his hair stood up on end;"
4229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And him, whom all the skill and pow’r of arms did late attend,"
4230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now like a man in counsel poor, that, travelling, goes amiss,"
4231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And having pass’d a boundless plain, not knowing where he is,"
4232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Comes on the sudden where he sees a river rough, and raves"
4233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his own billows ravishéd into the king of waves,"
4234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Murmurs with foam, and frights him back; so he, amaz’d, retir’d,"
4235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus would make good his amaze: “O friends, we all admir’d"
4236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Hector, as one of himself, well-darting, bold in war,"
4237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When some God guards him still from death, and makes him dare so far."
4238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now Mars himself, form’d like a man, is present in his rage,"
4239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore, whatsoever cause importunes you to wage"
4240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"War with these Trojans, never strive, but gently take your rod,"
4241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest in your bosoms, for a man, ye ever find a God.”"
4242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As Greece retir’d, the pow’r of Troy did much more forward prease,"
4243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Hector two brave men of war sent to the fields of peace;
4244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Menesthes, and Anchialus; one chariot bare them both."
4245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their falls made Ajax Telamon ruthful of heart, and wroth"
4246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who lighten’d out a lance that smote Amphius Selages,"
4247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That dwelt in Pæsos, rich in lands, and did huge goods possess,"
4248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Fate, to Priam and his sons, conducted his supply."
4249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The jav’lin on his girdle strook, and piercéd mortally"
4250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His belly’s lower part; he fell: his arms had looks so trim,"
4251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That Ajax needs would prove their spoil; the Trojans pour’d on him
4252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whole storms of lances, large, and sharp, of which a number stuck"
4253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his rough shield; yet from the slain he did his jav’lin pluck,"
4254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But could not from his shoulders force the arms he did affect,"
4255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Trojans with such drifts of darts the body did protect;
4256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And wisely Telamonius fear’d their valorous defence,"
4257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So many, and so strong of hand, stood in with such expense"
4258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of deadly prowess; who repell’d, though big, strong, bold, he were,"
4259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The famous Ajax, and their friend did from his rapture bear."
4260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus this place fill’d with strength of fight; in th’ army’s other
4261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"prease,"
4262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tlepolemus, a tall big man, the son of Hercules,"
4263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A cruel destiny inspir’d, with strong desire to prove"
4264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Encounter with Sarpedon’s strength, the son of cloudy Jove;"
4265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, coming on to that stern end, had chosen him his foe."
4266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus Jove’s great nephew, and his son, ’gainst one another go."
4267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tlepolemus, to make his end more worth the will of fate,"
4268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Began as if he had her pow’r, and show’d the mortal state"
4269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of too much confidence in man, with this superfluous brave:"
4270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Sarpedon, what necessity or needless humour drave"
4271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy form to these wars, which in heart I know thou dost abhor,"
4272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man not seen in deeds of arms, a Lycian counsellor?"
4273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They lie that call thee son to Jove, since Jove bred none so late;"
4274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The men of elder times were they, that his high pow’r begat,"
4275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Such men as had Herculean force. My father Hercules
4276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was Jove’s true issue; he was bold; his deeds did well express
4277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They sprung out of a lion’s heart. He whilome came to Troy,"
4278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(For horse that Jupiter gave Tros, for Ganymed, his boy)"
4279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With six ships only, and few men, and tore the city down,"
4280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left all her broad ways desolate, and made the horse his own."
4281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For thee, thy mind is ill dispos’d, thy body’s pow’rs are poor,"
4282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore are thy troops so weak; the soldier evermore
4283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Follows the temper of his chief; and thou pull’st down a side.
4284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But say thou art the son of Jove, and hast thy means supplied"
4285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With forces fitting his descent, the pow’rs that I compel"
4286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall throw thee hence, and make thy head run ope the gates of hell.”"
4287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove’s Lycian issue answer’d him: “Tlepolemus, ’tis true"
4288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy father holy Ilion in that sort overthrew;
4289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ injustice of the king was cause, that, where thy father had"
4290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Us’d good deservings to his state, he quitted him with bad."
4291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hesione, the joy and grace of king Laomedon,"
4292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy father rescu’d from a whale, and gave to Telamon"
4293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In honour’d nuptials (Telamon, from whom your strongest Greek"
4294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Boasts to have issu’d) and this grace might well expect the like;
4295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet he gave taunts for thanks, and kept, against his oath, his horse,"
4296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore both thy father’s strength, and justice, might enforce"
4297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wreak he took on Troy; but this and thy cause differ far.
4298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sons seldom heir their fathers’ worths. Thou canst not make his war.
4299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What thou assum’st for him, is mine, to be on thee impos’d.”"
4300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this, he threw an ashen dart; and then Tlepolemus los’d"
4301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Another from his glorious hand. Both at one instant flew,"
4302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both strook, both wounded. From his neck Sarpedon’s jav’lin drew"
4303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The life blood of Tlepolemus; full in the midst it fell;
4304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And what he threaten’d, th’ other gave, that darkness, and that hell."
4305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sarpedon’s left thigh took the lance; it pierc’d the solid bone,"
4306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with his raging head ran through; but Jove preserv’d his son.
4307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The dart yet vex’d him bitterly, which should have been pull’d out,"
4308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But none consider’d then so much, so thick came on the rout,"
4309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And fill’d each hand so full of cause to ply his own defence;
4310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Twas held enough, both fall’n that both were nobly carried thence"
4311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses knew th’ events of both, and took it much to heart"
4312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That his friend’s enemy should ’scape; and in a twofold part
4313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His thoughts contended, if he should pursue Sarpedon’s life,"
4314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or take his friend’s wreak on his men. Fate did conclude this strife,"
4315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By whom ’twas otherwise decreed than that Ulysses’ steel
4316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should end Sarpedon. In this doubt Minerva took the wheel
4317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From fickle Chance, and made his mind resolve to right his friend"
4318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With that blood he could surest draw. Then did Revenge extend
4319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her full pow’r on the multitude; then did he never miss;
4320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alastor, Halius, Chromius, Noemon, Prytanis,"
4321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alcander, and a number more, he slew, and more had slain,"
4322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If Hector had not understood; whose pow’r made in amain,"
4323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And strook fear through the Grecian troops, but to Sarpedon gave"
4324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hope of full rescue, who thus cried: “O Hector! Help and save"
4325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My body from the spoil of Greece, that to your lovéd town"
4326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My friends may see me borne, and then let earth possess her own"
4327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this soil, for whose sake I left my country’s; for no day"
4328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall ever show me that again, nor to my wife display,"
4329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And young hope of my name, the joy of my much thirsted sight;"
4330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All which I left for Troy, for them let Troy then do this right.”"
4331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all this Hector gives no word, but greedily he strives"
4332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all speed to repel the Greeks, and shed in floods their lives,"
4333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And left Sarpedon; but what face soever he put on
4334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of following the common cause, he left this prince alone"
4335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For his particular grudge, because, so late, he was so plain"
4336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his reproof before the host, and that did he retain;"
4337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"However, for example sake, he would not show it then,"
4338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And for his shame too, since ’twas just. But good Sarpedon’s men"
4339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ventur’d themselves, and forc’d him off, and set him underneath"
4340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The goodly beech of Jupiter, where now they did unsheath"
4341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ashen lance; strong Pelagon, his friend, most lov’d, most true,"
4342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enforc’d it from his maiméd thigh; with which his spirit flew,"
4343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And darkness over-flew his eyes; yet with a gentle gale,"
4344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That round about the dying prince cool Boreas did exhale,"
4345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He was reviv’d, recomforted, that else had griev’d and died."
4346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All this time flight drave to the fleet the Argives, who applied"
4347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No weapon ’gainst the proud pursuit, nor ever turn’d a head,"
4348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They knew so well that Mars pursu’d, and dreadful Hector led."
4349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then who was first, who last, whose lives the iron Mars did seize,"
4350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Priam’s Hector? Helenus, surnam’d Œnopides;"
4351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good Teuthras; and Orestes, skill’d in managing of horse;"
4352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bold Œnomaus; and a man renown’d for martial force,"
4353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Trechus, the great Ætolian chief; Oresbius, that did wear"
4354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The gaudy mitre, studied wealth extremely, and dwelt near"
4355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ Atlantic lake Cephisides, in Hyla, by whose seat"
4356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The good men of Bœotia dwelt. This slaughter grew so great,"
4357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It flew to heav’n; Saturnia discern’d it, and cried out"
4358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Pallas: “O unworthy sight! To see a field so fought,"
4359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And break our words to Sparta’s king, that Ilion should be rac’d,"
4360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he return reveng’d; when thus we see his Greeks disgrac’d,"
4361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bear the harmful rage of Mars! Come, let us use our care,"
4362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That we dishonour not our pow’rs.” Minerva was as yare
4363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As she at the despite of Troy. Her golden-bridled steeds
4364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Saturn’s daughter brought abroad; and Hebe, she proceeds"
4365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ address her chariot; instantly she gives it either wheel,"
4366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Beam’d with eight spokes of sounding brass; the axle-tree was steel;
4367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fell’ffs incorruptible gold, their upper bands of brass,"
4368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their matter most unvalued, their work of wondrous grace;"
4369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The naves, in which the spokes were driv’n, were all with silver bound;"
4370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The chariot’s seat two hoops of gold and silver strengthen’d round,"
4371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Edg’d with a gold and silver fringe; the beam, that look’d before,"
4372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was massy silver; on whose top, gears all of gold it wore,"
4373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And golden poitrils. Juno mounts, and her hot horses rein’d,"
4374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That thirsted for contentión, and still of peace complain’d."
4375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva wrapt her in the robe, that curiously she wove,"
4376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With glorious colours, as she sate on th’ azure floor of Jove,"
4377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And wore the arms that he puts on, bent to the tearful field."
4378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About her broad-spread shoulders hung his huge and horrid shield,"
4379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fring’d round with ever-fighting snakes; through it was drawn to life
4380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The miseries and deaths of fight; in it frown’d bloody Strife,"
4381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In it shin’d sacred Fortitude, in it fell Púrsuit flew,"
4382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In it the monster Gorgon’s head, in which held out to view"
4383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were all the dire ostents of Jove; on her big head she plac’d
4384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His four-plum’d glitt’ring casque of gold, so admirably vast"
4385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It would an hundred garrisons of soldiers comprehend.
4386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then to her shining chariot her vig’rous feet ascend;
4387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in her violent hand she takes his grave, huge, solid lance,"
4388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With which the conquests of her wrath she useth to advance,"
4389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And overturn whole fields of men, to show she was the Seed"
4390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of him that thunders. Then heav’n’s Queen, to urge her horses’ speed,"
4391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Takes up the scourge, and forth they fly. The ample gates of heav’n"
4392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rung, and flew open of themselves; the charge whereof is giv’n,"
4393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all Olympus, and the sky, to the distinguish’d Hours,"
4394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That clear, or hide it all in clouds, or pour it down in show’rs."
4395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This way their scourge-obeying horse made haste, and soon they won"
4396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The top of all the topful heav’ns, where aged Saturn’s son"
4397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sat sever’d from the other Gods; then stay’d the white-arm’d Queen
4398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her steeds, and ask’d of Jove, if Mars did not incense his spleen"
4399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his foul deeds, in ruining so many and so great"
4400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In the command and grace of Greece, and in so rude a heat?"
4401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At which, she said, Apollo laugh’d, and Venus, who still sue"
4402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To that mad God, for violence that never justice knew;"
4403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For whose impiety, she ask’d, if, with his wishéd love,"
4404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Herself might free the field of him? He bade her rather move
4405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Athenia to the charge she sought, who us’d of old to be"
4406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bane of Mars, and had as well the gift of spoil as he."
4407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This grace she slack’d not, but her horse scourg’d, that in nature flew"
4408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Betwixt the cope of stars and earth; and how far at a view
4409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man into the purple sea may from a hill descry,"
4410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So far a high-neighing horse of heav’n at ev’ry jump would fly.[2]
4411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arriv’d at Troy, where, broke in curls, the two floods mix their force,"
4412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Scamander and bright Simois, Saturnia stay’d her horse,"
4413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took them from chariot, and a cloud of mighty depth diffus’d"
4414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About them; and the verdant banks of Simois produc’d
4415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In nature what they eat in heav’n. Then both the Goddesses[3]
4416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"March’d, like a pair of tim’rous doves, in hasting their access"
4417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To th’ Argive succour. Being arriv’d, where both the most and best"
4418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were heap’d together (showing all, like lions at a feast"
4419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of new-slain carcasses, or boars, beyond encounter strong)"
4420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There found they Diomed; and there, ’midst all th’ admiring throng,"
4421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Saturnia put on Stentor’s shape, that had a brazen voice,"
4422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And spake as loud as fifty men; like whom she made a noise,"
4423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And chid the Argives: “O ye Greeks, in name and outward rite"
4424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But princes only, not in act, what scandal, what despite,"
4425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Use ye to honour! All the time the great Æacides
4426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was conversant in arms, your foes durst not a foot address"
4427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without their ports, so much they fear’d his lance that all controll’d,"
4428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And now they outray to your fleet.” This did with shame make bold
4429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The gen’ral spirit and pow’r of Greece: when, with particular note"
4430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of their disgrace, Athenia made Tydeus’ issue hot."
4431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She found him at his chariot, refreshing of his wound"
4432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Inflicted by slain Pandarus; his sweat did so abound,"
4433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It much annoy’d him, underneath the broad belt of his shield;"
4434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With which, and tiréd with his toil, his soul could hardly yield"
4435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His body motion. With his hand he lifted up the belt,"
4436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And wip’d away that clotter’d blood the fervent wound did melt.
4437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva lean’d against his horse, and near their withers laid"
4438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her sacred hand, then spake to him: “Believe me, Diomed,"
4439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tydeus exampled not himself in thee his son; not great,"
4440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But yet he was a soldier; a man of so much heat,"
4441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That in his ambassy for Thebes, when I forbad his mind"
4442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To be too vent’rous, and when feasts his heart might have declin’d,"
4443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With which they welcom’d him, he made a challenge to the best,"
4444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And foil’d the best; I gave him aid, because the rust of rest,"
4445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That would have seiz’d another mind, he suffer’d not, but us’d"
4446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The trial I made like a man, and their soft feasts refus’d."
4447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, when I set thee on, thou faint’st; I guard thee, charge, exhort"
4448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, I abetting thee, thou shouldst be to the Greeks a fort,"
4449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And a dismay to Ilion, yet thou obey’st in nought,"
4450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Afraid, or slothful, or else both; henceforth renounce all thought"
4451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That ever thou wert Tydeus’ son.” He answer’d her: “I know
4452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou art Jove’s daughter, and, for that, in all just duty owe"
4453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy speeches rev’rence, yet affirm ingeniously that fear"
4454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Doth neither hold me spiritless, nor sloth. I only bear"
4455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy charge in zealous memory, that I should never war"
4456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any blesséd Deity, unless (exceeding far"
4457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The limits of her rule) the Queen, that governs chamber sport,"
4458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should press to field; and her thy will enjoin’d my lance to hurt.
4459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, He whose pow’r hath right in arms, I knew in person here,"
4460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides the Cyprian Deity; and therefore did forbear,"

4769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Rhëuns king of Lycia, and father to his wife."
4770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He went; and happily he went, the Gods walk’d all his way;"
4771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And being arriv’d in Lycia, where Xanthus doth display"
4772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The silver ensigns of his waves, the king of that broad land"
4773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Receiv’d him with a wondrous free and honourable hand.
4774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nine days he feasted him, and kill’d an ox in ev’ry day,"
4775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In thankful sacrifice to heav’n, for his fair guest; whose stay,"
4776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With rosy fingers, brought the world, the tenth well-welcom’d morn,"
4777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then the king did move to see, the letters he had borne"
4778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From his lov’d son-in-law; which seen, he wrought thus their contents:"
4779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Chimæra, the invincible, he sent him to convince,"
4780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sprung from no man, but mere divine; a lion’s shape before,"
4781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Behind a dragon’s, in the midst a goat’s shagg’d form, she bore,"
4782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And flames of deadly fervency flew from her breath and eyes;
4783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet her he slew; his confidence in sacred prodigies
4784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Render’d him victor. Then he gave his second conquest way
4785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the famous Solymi, when (he himself would say,"
4786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Reporting it) he enter’d on a passing vig’rous fight.
4787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His third huge labour he approv’d against a woman’s spite,"
4788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That fill’d a field of Amazons; he overcame them all.

4792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His deeds thus showing him deriv’d from some celestial race,"
4793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The king detain’d, and made amends, with doing him the grace"
4794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his fair daughter’s princely gift; and with her, for a dow’r,"
4795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gave half his kingdom; and to this, the Lycians on did pour"
4796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More than was giv’n to any king; a goodly planted field,"

4806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods then left him, lest a man should in their glories shine,"
4807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And set against him; for his son, Isandrus, in a strife"
4808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the valiant Solymi, Mars reft of light and life;"
4809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laodamïa, being envied of all the Goddesses,"

4813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his sad bosom, flying all the loth’d consórts of men."
4814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet had he one surviv’d to him, of those three childeren,"
4815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hippolochus, the root of me; who sent me here with charge"
4816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That I should always bear me well, and my deserts enlarge"

4825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Betwixt whom mutual gifts were giv’n, My grandsire gave to thine"
4826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A girdle of Phœnician work, impurpl’d wondrous fine,"
4827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thine gave a two-neck’d jug of gold, which, though I use not here,"
4828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet still it is my gem at home. But, if our fathers were"
4829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Familiar, or each other knew, I know not, since my sire"
4830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left me a child, at siege of Thebes, where he left his life’s fire."

4864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The queen gript hard her Hector’s hand, and said: “O worthiest son,"
4865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Why leav’st thou field? Is’t not because the curséd nation

4867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy mind to come and lift thy hands, in his high tow’r, to Jove."
4868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But stay a little, that myself may fetch our sweetest wine"
4869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To offer first to Jupiter, then that these joints of thine"

4876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wine brings much rescue, strength’ning much the body and the mind.”"
4877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The great helm-mover thus receiv’d the auth’ress of his kind:
4878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“My royal mother, bring no wine; lest rather it impair"
4879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than help my strength, and make my mind forgetful of th’ affair"
4880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Committed to it; and (to pour it out in sacrifice)
4881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I fear with unwash’d hands to serve the pure-liv’d Deities.
4882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor is it lawful, thus imbru’d with blood and dust, to prove"
4883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The will of heav’n, or offer vows to cloud-compelling Jove."
4884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I only come to use your pains (assembling other dames,"
4885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Matrons, and women honour’d most, with high and virtuous names)"
4886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With wine and odours, and a robe most ample, most of price,"
4887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And which is dearest in your love, to offer sacrifice"

4895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About this work, myself will go, to call into the field,"
4896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If he will hear me, Helen’s love; whom would the earth would yield)"

4899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Borne for the plague he hath been born, and bred to the deface,"
4900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By great Olympius, of Troy, our sire, and all our race.”"
4901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, grave Hecuba went home, and sent her maids about,"
4902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To bid the matrons. She herself descended, and search’d out,"
4903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within a place that breath’d perfumes, the richest robe she had;"
4904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which lay with many rich ones more, most curiously made"
4905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By women of Sidonia; which Paris brought from thence,"
4906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sailing the broad sea, when he made that voyage of offence,"
4907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which he brought home Helena. That robe, transferr’d so far,"
4908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(That was the undermost) she took; it glittered like a star;
4909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And with it went she to the fane, with many ladies more;"
4910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst whom fair-cheek’d Theano unlock’d the folded door;
4911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Chaste Theano, Antenor’s wife, and of Cissëus’ race,"
4912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sister to Hecuba, both born to that great king of Thrace."
4913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her th’ Ilions made Minerva’s priest; and her they follow’d all
4914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the temple’s highest tow’r, where on their knees they fall,"
4915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lift up their hands, and fill the fane with ladies’ piteous cries."
4916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then lovely Theano took the veil, and with it she implies"
4917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The great Palladium, praying thus: “Goddess of most renown"
4918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all the heav’n of Goddesses, great Guardian of our town,"
4919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rev’rend Minerva, break the lance of Diomed, cease his grace,"

4921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before our ports of Ilion, that instantly we may,"
4922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve unyok’d oxen-of-a-year, in this thy temple slay,"
4923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thy sole honour; take their bloods, and banish our offence;"
4924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Accept Troy’s zeal, her wives, and save her infants’ innocence.”"
4925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She pray’d, but Pallas would not grant. Mean space was Hector come"
4926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where Alexander’s lodgings were, that many a goodly room"
4927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had built in them by architects, of Troy’s most curious sort,"
4928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And were no lodgings, but a house; nor no house, but a court;"
4929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or had all these contain’d in them; and all within a tow’r,"
4930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Next Hector’s lodgings and the king’s. The lov’d of heav’n’s chief
4931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pow’r,"
4932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hector, here enter’d. In his hand a goodly lance he bore,"
4933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ten cubits long; the brazen head went shining ill before,"
4934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Help’d with a burnish’d ring of gold. He found his brother then
4935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the women, yet prepar’d to go amongst the men,"
4936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For in their chamber he was set, trimming his arms, his shield,"
4937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His curets, and was trying how his crookéd bow would yield"
4938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his straight arms. Amongst her maids was set the Argive Queen,"
4939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Commanding them in choicest works. When Hector’s eye had seen
4940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His brother thus accompanied, and that he could not bear"
4941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The very touching of his arms but where the women were,"
4942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And when the time so needed men, right cunningly he chid."
4943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That he might do it bitterly, his cowardice he hid,"
4944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That simply made him so retir’d, beneath an anger, feign’d"
4945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In him by Hector, for the hate the citizens sustain’d"
4946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against him, for the foil he took in their cause; and again,"
4947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For all their gen’ral foils in his. So Hector seems to plain
4948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his wrath to them, for their hate, and not his cowardice;[4]"
4949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As that were it that shelter’d him in his effeminacies,"
4950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And kept him, in that dang’rous time, from their fit aid in fight;"
4951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For which he chid thus: “Wretched man! So timeless is thy spite
4952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That ’tis not honest; and their hate is just, ’gainst which it bends."
4953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,War burns about the town for thee; for thee our slaughter’d friends
4954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besiege Troy with their carcasses, on whose heaps our high walls"
4955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Are overlook’d by enemies; the sad sounds of their falls
4956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without, are echo’d with the cries of wives and babes within;"
4957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all for thee; and yet for them thy honour cannot win
4958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Head of thine anger. Thou shouldst need no spirit to stir up thine,"
4959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thine should set the rest on fire, and with a rage divine"
4960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Chastise impartially the best, that impiously forbears."
4961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come forth, lest thy fair tow’rs and Troy be burn’d about thine ears.”"
4962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Paris acknowledg’d, as before, all just that Hector spake,"
4963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Allowing justice, though it were for his injustice’ sake;"
4964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And where his brother put a wrath upon him by his art,"
4965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He takes it, for his honour’s sake, as sprung out of his heart,"
4966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And rather would have anger seem his fault than cowardice;
4967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus he answer’d: “Since, with right, you join’d check with advice,"
4968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I hear you, give equal ear: It is not any spleen"
4969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the town, as you conceive, that makes me so unseen,"
4970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But sorrow for it; which to ease, and by discourse digest"
4971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within myself, I live so close; and yet, since men might wrest"
4972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My sad retreat, like you, my wife with her advice inclin’d"
4973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This my addression to the field; which was mine own free mind,"
4974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As well as th’ instance of her words; for though the foil were mine,"
4975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Conquest brings forth her wreaths by turns. Stay then this haste of
4976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,thine
4977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But till I arm, and I am made a cónsort for thee straight;—"
4978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or go, I’ll overtake thy haste.” Helen stood at receipt,"
4979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And took up all great Hector’s pow’rs, t’ attend her heavy words,"
4980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By which had Paris no reply. This vent her grief affords:
4981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Brother (if I may call you so, that had been better born"
4982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A dog, than such a horrid dame, as all men curse and scorn,"
4983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A mischief-maker, a man-plague) O would to God, the day,"
4984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That first gave light to me, had been a whirlwind in my way,"
4985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And borne me to some desert hill, or hid me in the rage"
4986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of earth’s most far-resounding seas, ere I should thus engage"
4987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The dear lives of so many friends! Yet since the Gods have been
4988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Helpless foreseers of my plagues, they might have likewise seen"
4989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That he they put in yoke with me, to bear out their award,"
4990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had been a man of much more spirit, and, or had noblier dar’d"
4991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To shield mine honour with this deed, or with his mind had known"
4992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much better the upbraids of men, that so he might have shown"
4993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(More like a man) some sense of grief for both my shame and his.
4994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But he is senseless, nor conceives what any manhood is,"
4995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor now, nor ever after will; and therefore hangs, I fear,"
4996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A plague above him. But come near, good brother; rest you here,"
4997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, of the world of men, stands charg’d with most unrest for me,"
4998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Vile wretch) and for my lover’s wrong; on whom a destiny
4999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So bitter is impos’d by Jove, that all succeeding times"
5000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will put, to our unended shames, in all men’s mouths our crimes.”"
5001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: “Helen, do not seek to make me sit with thee;"
5002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I must not stay, though well I know thy honour’d love of me."
5003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My mind calls forth to aid our friends, in whom my absence breeds"
5004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Longings to see me; for whose sakes, importune thou to deeds"
5005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This man by all means, that your care may make his own make hast,"
5006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And meet me in the open town, that all may see at last"
5007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He minds his lover. I myself will now go home, and see"
5008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My household, my dear wife, and son, that little hope of me;"
5009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, sister, ’tis without my skill, if I shall evermore"
5010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Return, and see them, or to earth, her right in me, restore."
5011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods may stoop me by the Greeks.” This said, he went to see"
5012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The virtuous princess, his true wife, white-arm’d Andromache."
5013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She, with her infant son and maid, was climb’d the tow’r about"
5014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sight of him that sought for her, weeping and crying out."
5015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hector, not finding her at home, was going forth; retir’d;"
5016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood in the gate; her woman call’d, and curiously inquir’d"
5017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where she was gone; bad tell him true, if she were gone to see"
5018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sisters, or his brothers’ wives; or whether she should be"
5019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At temple with the other dames, t’ implore Minerva’s ruth."
5020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her woman answer’d: Since he ask’d, and urg’d so much the truth,"
5021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The truth was she was neither gone, to see his brothers’ wives,"
5022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sisters, nor t’ implore the ruth of Pallas on their lives;"
5023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But she (advertis’d of the bane Troy suffer’d, and how vast"
5024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Conquest had made herself for Greece) like one distraught, made hast"
5025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ample Ilion with her son, and nurse, and all the way"
5026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mourn’d, and dissolv’d in tears for him. Then Hector made no stay,"
5027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But trod her path, and through the streets, magnificently built,"
5028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All the great city pass’d, and came where, seeing how blood was spilt,"
5029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Andromache might see him come: who made as he would pass
5030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ports without saluting her, not knowing where she was."
5031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She, with his sight, made breathless haste, to meet him; she, whose"
5032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,grace
5033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Brought him withal so great a dow’r; she that of all the race
5034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of king Aëtion only liv’d; Aëtion, whose house stood"
5035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath the mountain Placius, environ’d with the wood"
5036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Theban Hypoplace, being court to the Cilician land."
5037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She ran to Hector, and with her, tender of heart and hand,"
5038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her son, borne in his nurse’s arms; when, like a heav’nly sign,"
5039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Compact of many golden stars, the princely child did shine,"
5040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom Hector call’d Scamandrius, but whom the town did name"
5041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Astyanax, because his sire did only prop the same."
5042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hector, though grief bereft his speech, yet smil’d upon his joy."
5043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Andromache cried out, mix’d hands, and to the strength of Troy"
5044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus wept forth her affectión: “O noblest in desire!
5045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy mind, inflam’d with others’ good, will set thyself on fire."
5046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor pitiest thou thy son, nor wife, who must thy widow be,"
5047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If now thou issue; all the field will only run on thee.
5048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Better my shoulders underwent the earth, than thy decease;"
5049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For then would earth bear joys no more; then comes the black increase
5050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of griefs (like Greeks on Ilion). Alas! What one survives
5051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To be my refuge? One black day bereft sev’n brothers’ lives,"
5052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By stern Achilles; by his hand my father breath’d his last,"
5053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His high-wall’d rich Cilician Thebes[5] sack’d by him, and laid wast;"
5054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The royal body yet he left unspoil’d; religion charm’d
5055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That act of spoil; and all in fire he burn’d him cómplete arm’d;
5056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Built over him a royal tomb; and to the monument
5057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He left of him, th’ Oreades (that are the high descent"
5058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Ægis-bearing Jupiter) another of their own
5059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did add to it, and set it round with elms; by which is shown,"
5060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In theirs, the barrenness of death; yet might it serve beside"
5061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To shelter the sad monument from all the ruffinous pride

5136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go home, and set thy housewif’ry on these extremes of thought;"
5137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And drive war from them with thy maids; keep them from doing nought.
5138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These will be nothing; leave the cares of war to men, and me"
5139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In whom, of all the Ilion race, they take their high’st degree.”"
5140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On went his helm; his princess home, half cold with kindly fears;"
5141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When ev’ry fear turn’d back her looks, and ev’ry look shed tears."
5142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Foe-slaught’ring Hector’s house soon reach’d, her many women there"

5156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, like life’s mirror, bears his gait; so Paris from the tow’r"
5157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of lofty Pergamus came forth; he show’d a sun-like pow’r
5158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In carriage of his goodly parts, address’d now to the strife;"
5159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And found his noble brother near the place he left his wife.
5160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Him thus respected he salutes: “Right worthy, I have fear"
5161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That your so serious haste to field, my stay hath made forbear,"
5162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that I come not as you wish.” He answer’d: “Honour’d man,"

5366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, since he still fought with a club, surnam’d Clavigerus,"
5367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All men, and fair-girt ladies both, for honour call’d him so."
5368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He fought not with a keep-off spear, or with a far-shot bow,"
5369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, with a massy club of iron, he broke through arméd bands."
5370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet Lycurgus was his death, but not with force of hands;"
5371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With sleight (encount’ring in a lane, where his club wanted sway)"
5372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He thrust him through his spacious waist; who fell, and upwards lay,"
5373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In death not bowing his face to earth; his arms he did despoil,"
5374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which iron Mars bestow’d on him; and those, in Mars’s toil,"
5375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lycurgus ever after wore; but when he agéd grew,"
5376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enforc’d to keep his peaceful house, their use he did renew"
5377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On mighty Ereuthalion’s limbs, his soldier, lovéd well;"
5378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, with these arms he challeng’d all, that did in arms excel;"
5379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All shook, and stood dismay’d, none durst his adverse champion make."
5380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet this same forward mind of mine, of choice, would undertake"
5381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To fight with all his confidence; though youngest enemy
5382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the army we conduct, yet I fought with him, I,"
5383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva made me so renown’d, and that most tall strong peer"
5384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I slew; his big bulk lay on earth, extended here and there,"
5385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As it were covetous to spread the centre ev’rywhere.
5386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O that my youth were now as fresh, and all my pow’rs as sound,"
5387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Soon should bold Hector be impugn’d! Yet you that most are crown’d
5388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With fortitude of all our host, ev’n you methinks are slow,"
5389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not free, and set on fire with lust, t’ encounter such a foe.”"
5390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this, nine royal princes rose. Atrides for the first;"
5391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Diomed; th’ Ajaces then, that did th’ encounter thirst;"
5392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,King Idomen and his consórts; Mars-like Meriones;
5393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Evemon’s son, Eurypylus: and Andræmonides,"
5394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom all the Grecians Thoas call’d, sprung of Andræmon’s blood;"
5395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And wise Ulysses; ev’ry one, propos’d for combat, stood."
5396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Again Gerenius Nestor spake: “Let lots be drawn by all;
5397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His hand shall help the well-arm’d Greeks, on whom the lot doth fall,"
5398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to his wish shall he be help’d, if he escape with life"
5399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The harmful danger-breathing fit of his advent’rous strife.”
5400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Each mark’d his lot, and cast it into Agamemnon’s casque."
5401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The soldiers pray’d, held up their hands, and this of Jove did ask,"
5402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With eyes advanc’d to heav’n: “O Jove, so lead the herald’s hand,"
5403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Ajax, or great Tydeus’ son, may our wish’d champion stand,"
5404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or else the king himself that rules the rich Mycenian land.”
5405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, old Nestor mix’d the lots. The foremost lot survey’d"
5406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With Ajax Telamon was sign’d, as all the soldiers pray’d;"
5407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One of the heralds drew it forth, who brought and show’d it round,"
5408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beginning at the right hand first, to all the most renown’d."
5409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"None knowing it, ev’ry man denied; but when he forth did pass"
5410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To him which mark’d and cast it in; which famous Ajax was,"
5411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He stretch’d his hand, and into it the herald put the lot,"
5412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, viewing it, th’ inscription knew; the duke deniéd not,"
5413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But joyfully acknowledg’d it, and threw it at his feet,"
5414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “O friends, the lot is mine, which to my soul is sweet;"
5415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For now I hope my fame shall rise, in noble Hector’s fall."
5416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, whilst I arm myself, do you on great Saturnius call,"
5417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But silently, or to yourselves, that not a Trojan hear;"
5418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or openly, if you think good, since none alive we fear."
5419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"None with a will, if I will not, can my bold pow’rs affright,"
5420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At least for plain fierce swing of strength, or want of skill in fight;"
5421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For I will well prove that my birth; and breed, in Salamine"
5422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was not all consecrate to meat, or mere effects of wine.”"
5423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, the well-giv’n soldiers pray’d; up went to heav’n their"
5424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,eyne:
5425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Jove, that Ida dost protect, most happy, most divine,"
5426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Send victory to Ajax’ side; fame; grace his goodly limb;
5427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or (if thy love bless Hector’s life, and thou hast care of him.)"
5428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bestow on both like pow’r, like fame.” This said, in bright arms, shone"
5429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The good strong Ajax; who, when all his war attire was on,"
5430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"March’d like the hugely-figur’d Mars, when angry Jupiter"
5431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With strength, on people proud of strength, sends him forth to infer"
5432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wreakful contention, and comes on with presence full of fear;"
5433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So th’ Achive rampire, Telamon, did ’twixt the hosts appear;"
5434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Smil’d; yet of terrible aspéct; on earth, with ample pace,"
5435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He boldly stalk’d, and shook aloft his dart with deadly grace."
5436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It did the Grecians good to see; but heartquakes shook the joints
5437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Trojans, Hector’s self felt thoughts, with horrid points,"
5438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tempt his bold bosom; but he now must make no counterflight,"
5439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor, with his honour, now refuse, that had provok’d the fight."
5440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ajax came near; and, like a tow’r, his shield his bosom barr’d,"
5441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The right side brass, and sev’n ox-hides within it quilted hard;[4]"
5442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Old Tychius, the best currier; that did in Hyla dwell,"
5443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did frame it for exceeding proof, and wrought it wondrous well."
5444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this stood he to Hector close, and with this brave began:"
5445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Now, Hector, thou shalt clearly know, thus meeting man to man,"
5446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What other leaders arm our host, besides great Thetis’ son,"
5447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who with his hardy lion’s heart hath armies overrun;
5448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But he lies at our crook’d-stern’d fleet, a rival with our king"
5449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In height of spirit; yet to Troy he many knights did bring,"
5450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Coequal with Æacides, all able to sustain"
5451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All thy bold challenge can import. Begin then, words are vain,”"
5452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The helm-grac’d Hector answer’d him: “Renownéd Telamon,"
5453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prince of the soldiers came from Greece, assay not me, like one"
5454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Young and immartial, with great words, as to an Amazon dame;"
5455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I have the habit of all fights, and know the bloody frame"
5456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of ev’ry slaughter; I well know the ready right hand charge,"
5457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I know the left, and ev’ry sway of my secureful targe;"
5458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I triumph in the cruelty of fixéd combat fight,"
5459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And manage horse to all designs; I think then with good right
5460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I may be confident as far as this my challenge goes,"
5461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without being taxéd with a vaunt, borne out with empty shows."
5462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, being a soldier so renown’d, I will not work on thee"
5463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With least advantage of that skill I know doth strengthen me,"
5464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so, with privity of sleight, win that for which I strive,"
5465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But at thy best, ev’n open strength, if my endeavours thrive.”"
5466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus sent he his long jav’lin forth. It strook his foe’s huge shield
5467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Near to the upper skirt of brass, which was the eighth it held."
5468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Six folds th’ untamed dart strook through, and in the sev’nth tough"
5469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,hide
5470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The point was check’d. Then Ajax threw; his angry lance did glide
5471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Quite through his bright orbicular targe, his curace, shirt of mail,"
5472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And did his manly stomach’s mouth with dang’rous taint assail;
5473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, in the bowing of himself, black death too short did strike."
5474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then both, to pluck their jav’lins forth, encounter’d, lion-like,"
5475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose bloody violence is, increas’d by that raw food they eat,"
5476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or boars whose strength wild nourishment doth make so wondrous great.
5477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Again Priamides did wound in midst his shield of brass,"
5478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet pierc’d not through the upper plate, the head reflected was."
5479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Ajax, following his lance, smote through his target quite,"
5480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And stay’d bold Hector rushing in; the lance held way outright,"
5481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And hurt his neck; out gush’d the blood. Yet Hector ceas’d not so,"
5482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But in his strong hand took a flint, as he did backwards go,"
5483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Black, sharp, and big, laid in the field; the sev’nfold targe it smit"
5484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Full on the boss, and round about the brass did ring with it."
5485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Ajax a far greater stone lift up, and (wreathing round,"
5486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all his body laid to it) he sent it forth to wound,"
5487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And gave unmeasur’d force to it; the round stone broke within
5488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His rundled target; his lov’d knees to languish did begin;
5489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he lean’d, stretch’d out on his shield; but Phœbus rais’d him"
5490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,straight.
5491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then had they laid on wounds with swords, in use of closer fight,"
5492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Unless the heralds (messengers of Gods and godlike men)
5493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The one of Troy, the other Greece, had held betwixt them then"
5494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Imperial sceptres; when the one, Idæus, grave and wise,"
5495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Said to them: “Now no more, my sons; the Sov’reign of the skies"
5496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Doth love you both; both soldiers are, all witness with good right;"
5497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But now night lays her mace on earth; ’tis good t’ obey the night.”
5498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Idæus,” Telamon replied, “to Hector speak, not me;"
5499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He that call’d all our Achive peers to station-fight, ’twas he;"
5500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If he first cease, I gladly yield.” Great Hector then began:"
5501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Ajax, since Jove, to thy big form, made thee so strong a man,"
5502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And gave thee skill to use thy strength, so much, that for thy spear"
5503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou art most excellent of Greece, now let us fight forbear."
5504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hereafter we shall war again, till Jove our herald be,"
5505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And grace with conquest which he will. Heav’n yields to night, and we."
5506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go thou and comfort all thy fleet, all friends and men of thine,"
5507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As I in Troy my favourers, who in the fane divine"
5508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have offer’d orisons for me; and come, let us impart"
5509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some ensigns of our strife, to show each other’s suppled heart,"
5510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That men of Troy and Greece may say, Thus their high quarrel ends."
5511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those that, encount’ring, were such foes, are now, being sep’rate,"
5512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"friends,”"
5513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He gave a sword, whose handle was with silver studs through driv’n,[5]"
5514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Scabbard and all, with hangers rich. By Telamon was giv’n"
5515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A fair well-glosséd purple waist. Thus Hector went to Troy,"
5516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And after him a multitude, fill’d with his safety’s joy,"
5517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Despairing he could ever ’scape the puissant fortitude
5518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And unimpeachéd Ajax’ hands. The Greeks like joy renew’d
5519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For their reputed victory, and brought him to the king;"
5520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who to the great Saturnides preferr’d an offering,"
5521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An ox that fed on five fair springs; they flay’d and quarter’d him,[6]"
5522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then, in pieces cut, on spits they roasted ev’ry limb;"
5523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which neatly dress’d, they drew it off. Work done, they fell to feast;"
5524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All had enough; but Telamon, the king fed past the rest"
5525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With good large pieces of the chine. Thus thirst and hunger stay’d,"
5526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nestor, whose counsels late were best, vows new, and first he said:"
5527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Atrides, and my other lords, a sort of Greeks are dead,"
5528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose black blood, near Scamander’s stream, inhuman Mars hath shed;"
5529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their souls to hell descended are. It fits thee then, our king,"
5530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make our soldiers cease from war; and, by the day’s first spring,"
5531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let us ourselves, assembled all, the bodies bear to fire,"
5532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With mules and oxen near our fleet, that, when we home retire,"
5533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Each man may carry to the sons, of fathers slaughter’d here,"
5534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their honour’d bones. One tomb for all, for ever, let us rear,"
5535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Circling the pile without the field; at which we will erect
5536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Walls, and a rav’lin, that may safe our fleet and us protect."
5537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in them let us fashion gates, solid, and barr’d about,"
5538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through which our horse, and chariots, may well get in and out."
5539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without all, let us dig a dike, so deep it may avail"
5540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our forces ’gainst the charge of horse, and foot, that come t’ assail."
5541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus th’ attempts, that I see swell, in Troy’s proud heart, shall"
5542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,fail.”
5543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The kings do his advice approve. So Troy doth court convent
5544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At Priam’s gate, in th’ Ilion tow’r, fearful and turbulent."
5545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst all, wise Antenor spake: “Trojans, and Dardan friends,"
5546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And peers assistants, give good ear to what my care commends"
5547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To your consents, for all our good. Resolve, let us restore"
5548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Argive Helen, with her wealth, to him she had before."
5549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We now defend but broken faiths. If, therefore, ye refuse,"
5550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No good event can I expect of all the wars, we use.”"
5551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He ceas’d; and Alexander spake; husband to the Argive queen:
5552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Antenor, to mine ears thy words harsh and ungracious been."
5553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou canst use better if thou wilt: but, if these truly fit"
5554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy serious thoughts, the Gods with age have reft thy graver wit,"
5555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To warlike Trojans I will speak: I clearly do deny
5556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To yield my wife, but all her wealth I render willingly,"
5557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whatever I from Argos brought, and vow to make it more,"
5558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which I have ready in my house, if peace I may restore.”"
5559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Priam, surnam’d Dardanides, godlike; in counsels grave;"
5560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his son’s favour well-advis’d, this resolution gave:"
5561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“My royal friends of ev’ry state, there is sufficient done,"
5562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For this late council we have call’d, in th’ offer of my son."
5563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now then let all take needful food, then let the watch be set,"
5564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ev’ry court of guard held strong; so, when the morn doth wet"
5565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The high-rais’d battlements of Troy, Idæus shall be sent"
5566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To th’ Argive fleet, and Atreus’ sons, t’ unfold my son’s intent,"
5567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From whose fact our contention springs; and, if they will, obtain"
5568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Respite from heat of fight, till fire consume our soldiers slain;"
5569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And after, our most fatal war let us importune still,"
5570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till Jove the conquest have dispos’d to his unconquer’d will.”
5571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All heard, and did obey the king; and, in their quarters, all,"
5572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That were to set the watch that night, did to their suppers fall."
5573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Idæus in the morning went, and th’ Achive peers did find"
5574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In council at Atrides’ ship; his audience was assign’d;
5575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, in the midst of all the kings, the vocal herald said:"
5576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Atrides! My renownéd king, and other kings, his aid,"
5577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Propose by me, in their commands, the offers Paris makes,"
5578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From whose joy all our woes proceed. He princely undertakes
5579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That all the wealth he brought from Greece (would he had died before!)
5580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He will, with other added wealth, for your amends restore"
5581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But famous Menelaus’ wife he still means to enjoy,"
5582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though he be urg’d the contrary, by all the peers of Troy."
5583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And this besides I have in charge, that, if it please you all,"
5584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They wish both sides may cease from war, that rites of funeral"
5585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May on their bodies be perform’d, that ill, the fields lie slain;"
5586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And after, to the will of Fate, renew the fight again.”"
5587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All silence held at first; at last Tydides made reply:
5588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Let no man take the wealth, or dame; for now a child’s weak eye"
5589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,May see the imminent black end of Priam’s empery.”
5590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This sentence, quick and briefly giv’n, the Greeks did all admire."
5591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then said, the king: “Herald, thou hear’st the voice entire"
5592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all our peers, to answer thee, for that of Priam’s son."
5593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, for our burning of the dead, by all means I am won"
5594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To satisfy thy king therein, without the slend’rest gain"
5595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made of their spoiléd carcasses; but freely, being slain,"
5596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They shall be all consum’d with fire. To which I cite
5597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,High thund’ring Jove; that is the king of Juno’s delight.”
5598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this, he held his sceptre up, to all the sky-thron’d Pow’rs;"
5599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And grave Idæus did return to sacred Ilion’s tow’rs,"
5600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where Ilians, and Dardanians, did still their counsels ply,"
5601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Expecting his return. He came, and told his legacy."
5602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All, whirlwind-like, assembled then, some bodies to transport,"
5603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some to hew trees. On th’ other part, the Argives did exhort"
5604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their soldiers to the same affairs. Then, did the new fir’d sun"
5605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Smite the broad fields, ascending heav’n, and th’ ocean smooth did run;"
5606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Greece and Troy mix’d in such peace, you scarce could either know."
5607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then wash’d they off their blood and dust, and did warm tears bestow"
5608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon the slaughter’d, and in cars convey’d them from the field."
5609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Priam commanded none should mourn, but in still silence yield"
5610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their honour’d carcasses to fire, and only grieve in heart."
5611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All burn’d; to Troy Troy’s friends retire, to fleet the Grecian part."
5612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet doubtful night obscur’d the earth, the day did not appear,"
5613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When round about the fun’ral pile, the Grecians gather’d were."
5614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The pile they circled with a tomb, and by it rais’d a wall,"
5615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"High tow’rs, to guard the fleet and them; and in the midst of all"
5616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They built strong gates, through which the horse and chariots passage"
5617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,had;
5618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without the rampire a broad dike, long and profound, they made,"
5619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On which they pallisadoes pitch’d; and thus the Grecians wrought.
5620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their huge works in so little time were to perfection brought,"
5621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That all Gods, by the Lightner set, the frame thereof admir’d;"
5622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Mongst whom the Earthquake-making God, this of their king inquir’d:"
5623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Father of Gods, will any man, of all earth’s grassy sphere,"
5624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ask any of the Gods’ consents to any actions there,"
5625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If thou wilt see the shag-hair’d Greeks, with headstrong labours frame"
5626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So huge a work, and not to us due off’rings first enflame?"
5627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As far as white Aurora’s dews are sprinkled through the air,"
5628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fame will renown the hands of Greece, for this divine affair;"
5629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Men will forget the sacred work, the Sun and I did raise"
5630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For king Laomedon (bright Troy) and this will bear the praise.”
5631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove was extremely mov’d with him, and said: “What words are these,"
5632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou mighty Shaker of the earth, thou Lord of all the seas?"
5633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some other God, of far less pow’r, might hold conceits, dismay’d"
5634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this rare Grecian stratagem, and thou rest well apaid;[7]"
5635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For it will glorify thy name, as far as light extends;"
5636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since, when these Greeks shall see again their native soil and friends,"
5637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bulwark batter’d, thou mayst quite devour it with thy waves,"
5638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And cover, with thy fruitless sands, this fatal shore of graves;"
5639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, what their fi’ry industries have so divinely wrought"
5640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In raising it, in razing it thy pow’r will prove it nought.”"
5641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus spake the Gods among themselves. Set was the fervent sun;
5642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And now the great work of the Greeks was absolutely done.
5643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then slew they oxen in their tents, and strength with food reviv’d,"
5644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When out of Lemnos a great fleet of od’rous wine arrived,"
5645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sent by Eunëus, Jason’s son, born of Hypsipyle."
5646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fleet contain’d a thousand tun, which must transported be"
5647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Atreus’ sons, as he gave charge, whose merchandise it was."
5648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks bought wine for shining steel, and some for sounding brass,"
5649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some for ox-hides, for oxen some, and some for prisoners."
5650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A sumptuous banquet was prepar’d; and all that night the peers
5651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And fair-hair’d Greeks consum’d in feast. So Trojans, and their aid."
5652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all the night Jove thunder’d loud; pale fear all thoughts dismay’d.
5653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While they were gluttonous in earth, Jove wrought their banes in"
5654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,heav’n.
5655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They pour’d full cups upon the ground, and were to off’rings driv’n"
5656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Instead of quaffings; and to drink, none durst attempt, before"

6327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, many meeting there, thou may’st hear ev’ry man’s conceit,"
6328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And take the best. It much concerns all Greeks to use advice

6349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A sceptre, and establish’d laws, that thou mayst well command,"

6361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But you, obeying your high mind, would venture the event,"
6362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dishonouring our ablest Greek, a man th’ Immortals grace."
6363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Again yet let’s deliberate, to make him now embrace"
6364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Affection to our gen’ral good, and bring his force to field;"

6366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O father,” answeréd the king, “my wrongs thou tell’st me right."

6384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair Brisis, and I deeply swear (for any fact of mine"
6385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That may discourage her receipt) she is untouch’d, and rests"
6386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As he resign’d her. To these gifts (if Jove to our requests

6467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ajax to Phœnix made a sign, as if too long they stay’d"
6468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before they told their legacy. Ulysses saw him wink,"
6469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, filling the great bowl with wine, did to Achilles drink:"

6475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If we can save our fleet or not, unless thyself endow"

6489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I am seriously afraid, Heav’n will perform his threats,"
6490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that ’tis fatal to us all, far from our native seats,"
6491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To perish in victorious Troy. But rise, though it be late,"
6492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Deliver the afflicted Greeks from Troy’s tumultuous hate;
6493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It will hereafter be thy grief, when no strength can suffice"

6513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That man should bear no poor account, nor want gold’s quick’ning sweet,"
6514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That had but what he won with them; sev’n worthiest Lesbian dames,"
6515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Renown’d for skill in housewif’ry, and bear the sov’reign fames"
6516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For beauty from their gen’ral sex, which, at thy overthrow"

6588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And cannot all these helps repress this kill-man Hector’s fright?
6589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When I was arm’d among the Greeks, he would not offer fight"
6590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without the shadow of his walls; but to the Scæan ports,"
6591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or to the holy beach of Jove, come back’d with his consorts;"
6592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where once he stood my charge alone, and hardly made retreat,"
6593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to make new proof of our pow’rs, the doubt is not so great."
6594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To-morrow then, with sacrifice perform’d t’ imperial Jove"
6595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the Gods, I’ll launch my fleet, and all my men remove;"
6596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which (if thou wilt use so thy sight, or think’st it worth respect)"
6597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In forehead of the morn, thine eyes shall see, with sails erect"
6598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amidst the fishy Hellespont, help’d with laborious oars."
6599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, if the Sea-god send free sail, the fruitful Phthian shores"
6600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within three days we shall attain, where I have store of prise"
6601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left, when with prejudice I came to these indignities."
6602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There have I gold as well as here, and store of ruddy brass,"
6603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dames slender, elegantly girt, and steel as bright as glass."
6604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These will I take as I retire, as shares I firmly save,"
6605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though Agamemnon be so base to take the gifts he gave.
6606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tell him all this, and openly, I on your honours charge,"
6607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That others may take shame to hear his lusts command so large,"
6608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, if there yet remain a man he hopeth to deceive"
6609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Being dyed in endless impudence) that man may learn to leave
6610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His trust and empire. But alas, though, like a wolf he be,"
6611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shameless and rude, he durst not take my prise, and look on me."
6612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I never will partake his works, nor counsels, as before,"
6613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He once deceiv’d and injur’d me, and he shall never more"
6614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Tye my affections with his words. Enough is the increase
6615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of one success in his deceits; which let him joy in peace,"
6616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And bear it to a wretched end. Wise Jove hath reft his brain
6617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To bring him plagues, and these his gifts I, as my foes, disdain."
6618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n in the numbness of calm death I will revengeful be,"
6619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though ten or twenty times so much he would bestow on me,"
6620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All he hath here, or any where, or Orchomen contains,"
6621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To which men bring their wealth for strength, or all the store remains"
6622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In circuit of Egyptian Thebes, where much hid treasure lies,"
6623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose walls contain an hundred ports, of so admir’d a size"
6624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Two hundred soldiers may a-front with horse and chariots pass.
6625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor, would he amplify all this like sand, or dust, or grass,"
6626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should he reclaim me, till this wreak pay’d me for all the pains"
6627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That with his contumely burn’d, like poison, in my veins."
6628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor shall his daughter be my wife, although she might contend"
6629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With golden Venus for her form, or if she did transcend"
6630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Blue-ey’d Minerva for her works; let him a Greek select
6631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fit for her, and a greater king. For if the Gods protect"
6632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My safety to my father’s court, he shall choose me a wife."
6633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Many fair Achive princesses of unimpeachéd life
6634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Helle and in Phthia live, whose sires do cities hold,"
6635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of whom I can have whom I will. And, more an hundred fold"
6636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My true mind in my country likes to take a lawful wife
6637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Than in another nation; and there delight my life
6638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With those goods that my father got, much rather than die here."
6639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not all the wealth of well-built Troy, possess’d when peace was there,"
6640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All that Apollo’s marble fane in stony Pythos holds,"
6641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I value equal with the life that my free breast enfolds.
6642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sheep, oxen, tripods, crest-deck’d horse, though lost, may come again,"
6643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But when the white guard of our teeth no longer can contain
6644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our human soul, away it flies, and, once gone, never more"
6645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To her frail mansion any man can her lost pow’rs restore.
6646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore since my mother-queen, fam’d for her silver feet,"
6647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Told me two fates about my death in my direction meet:
6648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The one, that, if I here remain t’ assist our victory,"
6649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My safe return shall never live, my fame shall never die;"
6650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If my return obtain success, much of my fame decays,"
6651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But death shall linger his approach, and I live many days,"
6652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This being reveal’d, ’twere foolish pride, t’ abridge my life for"
6653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,praise.
6654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then with myself, I will advise, others to hoise their sail,"
6655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, ’gainst the height of Ilion, you never shall prevail,"
6656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove with his hand protecteth it, and makes the soldiers bold."
6657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This tell the kings in ev’ry part, for so grave legates should,"
6658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That they may better counsels use, to save their fleet and friends"
6659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By their own valours; since this course, drown’d in my anger, ends."
6660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Phœnix may in my tent repose, and in the morn steer course"
6661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Phthia, if he think it good; if not, I’ll use no force.”"
6662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All wonder’d at his stern reply; and Phœnix, full of fears"
6663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His words would be more weak than just, supplied their wants with"
6664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,tears.
6665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“If thy return incline thee thus, Peleus’ renownéd joy,"
6666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thou wilt let our ships be burn’d with harmful fire of Troy,"
6667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since thou art angry, O my son, how shall I after be"
6668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alone in these extremes of death, relinquishéd by thee?"
6669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I, whom thy royal father sent as ord’rer of thy force,"
6670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When to Atrides from his court he left thee for this course,"
6671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet young, and when in skill of arms thou didst not so abound,"
6672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor hadst the habit of discourse, that makes men so renown’d."
6673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all which I was set by him, t’ instruct thee as my son,"
6674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That thou might’st speak, when speech was fit, and do, when deeds were"
6675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"done,"
6676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not sit as dumb, for want of words, idle, for skill to move,"
6677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I would not then be left by thee, dear son, begot in love,"
6678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No, not if God would promise me, to raze the prints of time"
6679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Carv’d in my bosom and my brows, and grace me with the prime"
6680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of manly youth, as when at first I left sweet Helle’s shore"
6681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deck’d with fair dames, and fled the grudge my angry father bore;"
6682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who was the fair Amyntor call’d, surnam’d Ormenides,"
6683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And for a fair-hair’d harlot’s sake, that his affects could please,"
6684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Contemn’d my mother, his true wife, who ceaseless urgéd me"
6685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To use his harlot Clytia, and still would clasp my knee"
6686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To do her will, that so my sire might turn his love to hate"
6687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of that lewd dame, converting it to comfort her estate."
6688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At last I was content to prove to do my mother good,"
6689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And reconcile my father’s love; who straight suspicious stood,"
6690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pursuing me with many a curse, and to the Furies pray’d"
6691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No dame might love, nor bring me seed. The Deities obey’d"
6692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That govern hell; infernal Jove, and stern Persephone."
6693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then durst I in no longer date with my stern father be.
6694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet did my friends, and near allies, inclose me with desires"
6695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not to depart; kill’d sheep, boars, beeves; roast them at solemn fires;"
6696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And from my father’s tuns we drunk exceeding store of wine.
6697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nine nights they guarded me by turns, their fires did ceaseless shine,"
6698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One in the porch of his strong hall, and in the portal one,"
6699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before my chamber; but when day beneath the tenth night shone,"
6700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I brake my chamber’s thick-fram’d doors, and through the hall’s guard"
6701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"pass’d,"
6702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unseen of any man or maid. Through Greece then, rich and vast,"
6703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I fled to Phthia, nurse of sheep, and came to Peleus’ court;"
6704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who entertain’d me heartily, and in as gracious sort"
6705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As any sire his only son, born when his strength is spent,"
6706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And bless’d with great possessions to leave to his descent.
6707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He made me rich, and to my charge did much command commend."
6708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I dwelt in th’ utmost region rich Phthia doth extend,"
6709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And govern’d the Dolopians, and made thee what thou art,"
6710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O thou that like the Gods art fram’d. Since, dearest to my heart,"
6711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I us’d thee so, thou lov’dst none else; nor anywhere wouldst eat,"
6712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till I had crown’d my knee with thee, and carv’d thee tend’rest meat,"
6713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And giv’n thee wine so much, for love, that, in thy infancy"
6714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Which still discretion must protect, and a continual eye)"
6715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My bosom lovingly sustain’d the wine thine could not bear.
6716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then, now my strength needs thine as much, be mine to thee as dear,"
6717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much have I suffer’d for thy love, much labour’d, wishéd much,"
6718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thinking, since I must have no heir (the Gods’ decrees are such)"
6719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I would adopt thyself my heir. To thee my heart did give
6720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What any sire could give his son. In thee I hop’d to live.
6721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,O mitigate thy mighty spirits. It fits not one that moves
6722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hearts of all, to live unmov’d, and succour hates for loves."
6723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods themselves are flexible; whose virtues, honours, pow’rs,"
6724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are more than thine, yet they will bend their breasts as we bend ours."
6725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Perfumes, benign devotions, savours of off’rings burn’d,"
6726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And holy rites, the engines are with which their hearts are turn’d,"
6727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By men that pray to them, whose faith their sins have falsified."
6728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Pray’rs are daughters of great Jove, lame, wrinkled, ruddy-ey’d,"
6729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ever following injury, who, strong and sound of feet,"
6730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flies through the world, afflicting men. Believing Prayers yet,"
6731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all that love that Seed of Jove, the certain blessing get"
6732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To have Jove hear, and help them too; but if he shall refuse,"
6733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And stand inflexible to them, they fly to Jove, and use"
6734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their pow’rs against him, that the wrongs he doth to them may fall"
6735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his own head, and pay those pains whose cure he fails to call."
6736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then, great Achilles, honour thou this sacred Seed of Jove,"
6737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yield to them, since other men of greatest minds they move."
6738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If Agamemnon would not give the self-same gifts he vows,"
6739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But offer other afterwards, and in his still-bent brows"
6740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Entomb his honour and his word, I would not thus exhort,"
6741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With wrath appeas’d, thy aid to Greece, though plagu’d in heaviest"
6742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,sort;
6743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But much he presently will give, and after yield the rest."
6744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ assure which he hath sent to thee the men thou lovest best,"
6745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And most renown’d of all the host, that they might soften thee."
6746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then let not both their pains and pray’rs lost and despiséd be,"
6747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before which none could reprehend the tumult of thy heart,"
6748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But now to rest inexpiate were much too rude a part.
6749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of ancient worthies we have heard, when they were more displeas’d,"
6750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To their high fames, with gifts and pray’rs they have been still"
6751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,appeas’d.
6752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For instance, I remember well a fact perform’d of old,"
6753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which to you all, my friends, I’ll tell: The Curets wars did hold"
6754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With the well-fought Ætolians, where mutual lives had end"
6755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About the city Calydon. Th’ Ætolians did defend
6756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their flourishing country, which to spoil the Curets did contend."
6757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Diana with-the-golden-throne, with Oeneus much incens’d,"
6758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since with his plenteous land’s first fruits she was not reverenc’d,"
6759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Yet other Gods, with hecatombs, had feasts, and she alone,"
6760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Jove’s bright daughter, left unserv’d, or by oblivion,"
6761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or undue knowledge of her dues) much hurt in heart she swore;
6762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And she, enrag’d, excited much, she sent a sylvan boar"
6763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From their green groves, with wounding tusks; who usually did spoil"
6764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"King Oeneus’ fields, his lofty woods laid prostrate on the soil,"
6765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rent by the roots trees fresh, adorn’d with fragrant apple flow’rs."
6766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which Meleager (Oeneus’ son) slew, with assembl’d pow’rs"
6767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of hunters, and of fiercest hounds, from many cities brought;"
6768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For such he was that with few lives his death could not be bought,"
6769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Heaps of dead humans, by his rage, the fun’ral piles applied."
6770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, slain at last, the Goddess stirr’d about his head, and hide,"
6771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A wondrous tumult, and a war betwixt the Curets wrought"
6772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And brave Ætolians. All the while fierce Meleager fought,"
6773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ill-far’d the Curets; near the walls none durst advance his crest,"
6774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though they were many. But when wrath inflam’d his haughty breast
6775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Which oft the firm mind of the wise with passion doth infest)
6776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since ’twixt his mother-queen and him arose a deadly strife,"
6777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He left the court, and privately liv’d with his lawful wife,"
6778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair Cleopatra, female birth of bright Marpessa’s pain,"
6779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And of Ideus; who of all terrestrial men did reign,"
6780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At that time, king of fortitude, and for Marpessa’s sake,"
6781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Gainst wanton Phœbus, king of flames; his bow in hand did take,"
6782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since he had ravish’d her, his joy; whom her friends after gave"
6783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The surname of Alcyone, because they could not save"
6784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their daughter from Alcyone’s fate. In Cleopatra’s arms
6785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lay Meleager, feeding on his anger, for the harms"
6786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mother pray’d might fall on him; who, for her brother slain"
6787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Meleager, griev’d, and pray’d the Gods to wreak her pain"
6788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With all the horror could be pour’d upon her furious birth.
6789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still knock’d she with her impious hands the many-feeding earth,"
6790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To urge stern Pluto and his Queen t’ incline their vengeful ears,"
6791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fell on her knees, and all her breast dew’d with her fi’ry tears,"
6792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make them massacre her son, whose wrath enrag’d her thus."
6793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Erinnys, wand’ring through the air, heard, out of Erebus,"
6794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Pray’rs fit for her unpleaséd mind. Yet Meleager lay
6795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Obscur’d in fury. Then the bruit of the tumultuous fray
6796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rung through the turrets as they scal’d; then came th’ Ætolian peers
6797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Meleager with low suits, to rise and free their fears;"
6798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then sent they the chief priests of Gods, with offer’d gifts t’ atone"
6799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His diff’ring fury, bade him choose, in sweet-soil’d Calydon,"
6800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of the most fat and yieldy soil, what with an hundred steers"
6801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Might in a hundred days be plough’d, half that rich vintage bears,"
6802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And half of naked earth to plough; yet yielded not his ire.
6803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then to his lofty chamber-door, ascends his royal sire"
6804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With ruthful plaints, shook the strong bars; then came his sisters’"
6805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,cries;
6806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His mother then; and all intreat;—yet still more stiff he lies;—
6807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His friends, most rev’rend, most esteem’d; yet none impression took,"
6808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till the high turrets where he lay, and his strong chamber, shook"
6809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With the invading enemy, who now forced dreadful way"
6810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Along the city. Then his wife, in pitifil dismay,"
6811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besought him, weeping; telling him the miseries sustain’d"
6812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By all the citizens, whose town the enemy had gain’d;"
6813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Men slaughter’d; children bondslaves made; sweet ladies forc’d with
6814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,lust;
6815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fires climbing tow’rs, and turning them to heaps of fruitless dust."
6816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These dangers soften’d his steel heart. Up the stout prince arose,"
6817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Indu’d his body with rich arms, and freed th’ Ætolian’s woes,"
6818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His smother’d anger giving air; which gifts did not assuage,"
6819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But his own peril. And because he did not disengage
6820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their lives for gifts, their gifts he lost. But for my sake, dear"
6821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"friend,"
6822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be not thou bent to see our plights to these extremes descend,"
6823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ere thou assist us; be not so by thy ill angel turn’d
6824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From thine own honour. It were shame to see our navy burn’d,"
6825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then come with thy timeless aid. For offer’d presents, come,"
6826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the Greeks will honour thee, as of celestial room."
6827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But if without these gifts thou fight, forc’d by thy private woe,"
6828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou wilt be nothing so renown’d, though thou repel the foe.”"
6829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Achilles answer’d the last part of this oration thus:
6830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Phœnix, renown’d and reverend, the honours urg’d on us"
6831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We need not, Jove doth honour me, and to my safety sees,"
6832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And will, whiles I retain a spirit, or can command my knees."
6833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then do not thou with tears and woes impassion my affects,"
6834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Becoming gracious to my foe. Nor fits it the respects
6835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of thy vow’d love to honour him that hath dishonour’d me,"
6836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lest such loose kindness lose his heart that yet is firm to thee.
6837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It were thy praise to hurt with me the hurter of my state,"
6838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since half my honour and my realm thou mayst participate.
6839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let these lords then return th’ event, and do thou here repose,"
6840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, when dark sleep breaks with the day, our counsels shall disclose"
6841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The course of our return or stay.” This said, he with his eye"
6842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made to his friend a covert sign, to hasten instantly"
6843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A good soft bed, that the old prince, soon as the peers were gone,"
6844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Might take his rest; when, soldier-like, brave Ajax Telamon"
6845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Spake to Ulysses, as with thought Achilles was not worth"
6846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The high direction of his speech, that stood so sternly forth"
6847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unmov’d with th’ other orators, and spake, not to appease"
6848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pelides’ wrath, but to depart. His arguments were these:"
6849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“High-issu’d Laertiades, let us insist no more"
6850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On his persuasion. I perceive the world would end before
6851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our speeches end in this affair. We must with utmost haste
6852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Return his answer, though but bad. The peers are elsewhere plac’d,"
6853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And will not rise till we return. Great Thetis’ son hath stor’d
6854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Proud wrath within him, as his wealth, and will not be implor’d,"
6855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rude that he is, nor his friends’ love respects, do what they can,"
6856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wherein past all, we honour’d him. O unremorseful man!"
6857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Another for his brother slain, another for his son,"
6858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Accepts of satisfaction; and he the deed hath done
6859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lives in belov’d society long after his amends,"
6860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To which his foe’s high heart, for gifts, with patience condescends;"
6861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thee a wild and cruel spirit the Gods for plague have giv’n,"
6862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And for one girl, of whose fair sex we come to offer sev’n,"
6863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The most exempt for excellence, and many a better prise."
6864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then put a sweet mind in thy breast, respect thy own allies,"
6865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though others make thee not remiss. A multitude we are,"
6866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sprung of thy royal family, and our supremest care"
6867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is to be most familiar, and hold most love with thee"
6868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Greeks, how great an host soever here there be.”"
6869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: “Noble Telamon, prince of our soldiers here,"
6870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out of thy heart I know thou speak’st, and as thou hold’st me dear;"
6871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But still as often as I think, how rudely I was us’d,"
6872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, like a stranger, for all rites, fit for our good, refus’d"
6873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My heart doth swell against the man, that durst be so profane"
6874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To violate his sacred place; not for my private bane,"
6875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But since wrack’d virtue’s gen’ral laws he shameless did infringe;
6876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For whose sake I will loose the reins, and give mine anger swinge,"
6877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without my wisdom’s least impeach. He is a fool, and base,"
6878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That pities vice-plagu’d minds, when pain, not love of right, gives"
6879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,place.
6880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore tell your king, my lords, my just wrath will not care"
6881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all his cares, before my tents and navy chargéd are"
6882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By warlike Hector, making way through flocks of Grecian lives,"
6883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Enlighten’d by their naval fire; but when his rage arrives
6884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About my tent, and sable bark, I doubt not but to shield"
6885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Them and myself, and make him fly the there strong-bounded field.”"
6886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, each one but kiss’d the cup, and to the ships retir’d;"
6887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ulysses first. Patroclus then the men and maids requir’d
6888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make grave Phœnix’ bed with speed, and see he nothing lacks."

6896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The lofty Scyrus that was kept in Enyeius’ hold.
6897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now at the tent of Atreus’ son, each man with cups of gold"
6898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Receiv’d th’ ambassadors return’d. All cluster’d near to know
6899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What news they brought; which first the king would have Ulysses show:
6900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Say, most praiseworthy Ithacus, the Grecians’ great renown,"
6901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will he defend us? Or not yet will his proud stomach down?”
6902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses made reply: “Not yet will he appeaséd be,"
6903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But grows more wrathful, prizing light thy offer’d gifts and thee,"
6904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And wills thee to consult with us, and take some other course"
6905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To save our army and our fleet, and says, ‘with all his force,"
6906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The morn shall light him on his way to Phthia’s wishéd soil,"
6907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For never shall high-seated Troy be sack’d with all our toil,"
6908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove holds his hand ’twixt us and it, the soldiers gather heart.’"
6909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus he replies, which Ajax here can equally impart,"
6910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And both these heralds. Phœnix stays, for so was his desire,"
6911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To go with him, if he thought good; if not, he might retire.”"
6912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All wonder’d he should be so stern; at last bold Diomed spake:
6913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Would God, Atrides, thy request were yet to undertake,"
6914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all thy gifts unoffer’d him! He’s proud enough beside,"
6915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But this ambassage thou hast sent will make him burst with pride.
6916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But let us suffer him to stay, or go, at his desire,"
6917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fight when his stomach serves him best, or when Jove shall inspire."
6918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Meanwhile, our watch being strongly held, let us a little rest"
6919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"After our food; strength lives by both, and virtue is their guest."
6920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then when the rosy-finger’d Morn holds out her silver light,"
6921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bring forth thy host, encourage all, and be thou first in fight.”"
6922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The kings admir’d the fortitude, that so divinely mov’d"
6923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The skilful horseman Diomed, and his advice approv’d."
6924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then with their nightly sacrifice each took his sev’ral tent,"
6925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where all receiv’d the sov’reign gifts soft Somnus did present.

7017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Command strong watch, from sire to son urge all t’ observe the foe,"
7018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Familiarly, and with their praise, exciting ev’ry eye,"

7020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We must our patience exercise, and work ourselves with them,"
7021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Jove in our births combin’d such care to either’s diadem.”
7022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus he dismiss’d him, knowing well his charge before he went."
7023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself to Nestor, whom he found in bed within his tent,"
7024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By him his damask curets hung, his shield, a pair of darts,"
7025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His shining casque, his arming waist; in these he led the hearts"
7026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his apt soldiers to sharp war, not yielding to his years."
7027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He quickly started from his bed, when to his watchful ears"
7028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Untimely feet told some approach; he took his lance in hand,"
7029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And spake to him: “Ho, what art thou that walk’st at midnight? Stand."
7030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is any wanting at the guards? Or lack’st thou any peer?
7031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Speak, come not silent towards me; say, what intend’st thou here?”"
7032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: “O Neleides, grave honour of our host,"
7033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Tis Agamemnon thou mayst know, whom Jove afflicteth most"
7034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the wretched men that live, and will, whilst any breath"

7039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his extreme affects made cold, without my breast doth beat;"
7040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore are my sinews strook with trembling; ev’ry part
7041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of what my friends may feel hath act in my disperséd heart.
7042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, if thou think’st of any course may to our good redound,"
7043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Since neither thou thyself canst sleep) come, walk with me the round;"
7044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In way whereof we may confer, and look to ev’ry guard,"
7045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest watching long, and weariness with labouring so hard,"
7046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Drown their oppresséd memories of what they have in charge.
7047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The liberty we give the foe, alas, is over large,"
7048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their camp is almost mix’d with ours, and we have forth no spies"
7049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To learn their drifts; who may perchance this night intend surprise.”
7050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grave Nestor answer’d: “Worthy king, let good hearts bear our ill."
7051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Jove is not bound to perfect all this busy Hector’s will;
7052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But I am confidently giv’n, his thoughts are much dismay’d"
7053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With fear, lest our distress incite Achilles to our aid,"
7054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore will not tempt his fate, nor ours, with further pride."
7055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But I will gladly follow thee, and stir up more beside;"
7056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tydides, famous for his lance; Ulysses; Telamon;"
7057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bold Phylëus’ valiant heir. Or else, if anyone"
7058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would haste to call king Idomen, and Ajax, since their sail"
7059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lie so remov’d, with much good speed, it might our haste avail."
7060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, though he be our honour’d friend, thy brother I will blame,"
7061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not fearing if I anger thee. It is his utter shame
7062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He should commit all pains to thee, that should himself employ,"
7063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past all our princes, in the care, and cure, of our annoy,"
7064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And be so far from needing spurs to these his due respects,"
7065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He should apply our spirits himself, with pray’rs and urg’d affects."
7066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Necessity (a law to laws, and not to be endur’d)"
7067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Makes proof of all his faculties, not sound if not inur’d.”"
7068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Good father,” said the king, “sometimes you know I have desir’d"
7069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You would improve his negligence, too oft to ease retir’d."
7070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor is it for defect of spirit, or compass of his brain,"
7071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But with observing my estate, he thinks, he should abstain"
7072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till I commanded, knowing my place; unwilling to assume,"
7073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For being my brother, anything might prove he did presume."
7074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But now he rose before me far, and came t’ avoid delays,"
7075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And I have sent him for the men yourself desir’d to raise.
7076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come, we shall find them at the guards we plac’d before the fort,"
7077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For thither my direction was they should with speed resort.”
7078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Why now,” said Nestor, “none will grudge, nor his just rule withstand."
7079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Examples make excitements strong, and sweeten a command.”"
7080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus put he on his arming truss, fair shoes upon his feet,"
7081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About him a mandilion, that did with buttons meet,"
7082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of purple, large, and full of folds, curl’d with a warmful nap,"
7083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A garment that ’gainst cold in nights did soldiers use to wrap;
7084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then took he his strong lance in hand, made sharp with proved steel,"
7085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And went along the Grecian fleet. First at Ulysses’ keel
7086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He call’d, to break the silken fumes that did his senses bind."
7087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The voice through th’ organs of his ears straight rung about his mind.
7088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forth came Ulysses, asking him: “Why stir ye thus so late?"
7089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sustain we such enforcive cause?” He answered, “Our estate"
7090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Doth force this perturbation; vouchsafe it, worthy friend,"
7091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And come, let us excite one more, to counsel of some end"
7092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To our extremes, by fight, or flight.” He back, and took his shield,"
7093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And both took course to Diomed. They found him laid in field,"
7094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Far from his tent; his armour by; about him was dispread
7095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A ring of soldiers, ev’ry man his shield beneath his head;"
7096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His spear fix’d by him as he slept, the great end in the ground,"
7097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The point, that bristled the dark earth, cast a reflection round"
7098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like palid lightnings thrown from Jove; thus this heroë lay,"
7099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And under him a big ox-hide; his royal head had stay
7100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On arras hangings, rolléd up; whereon he slept so fast,"
7101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Nestor stirr’d him with his foot, and chid to see him cast"
7102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In such deep sleep in such deep woes, and ask’d him why he spent"
7103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All night in sleep, or did not hear the Trojans near his tent,"
7104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their camp drawn close upon their dike, small space ’twixt foes and"
7105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,foes?
7106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, starting up, said, “Strange old man, that never tak’st repose,"
7107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou art too patient of our toil. Have we not men more young,"
7108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To be employ’d from king to king? Thine age hath too much wrong.”
7109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Said like a king,” replied the sire, “for I have sons renown’d,"
7110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And there are many other men, might go this toilsome round;"
7111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, you must see, imperious Need hath all at her command."
7112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now on the eager razor’s edge, for life or death, we stand[2]"
7113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then go (thou art the younger man) and if thou love my ease,"
7114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call swift-foot Ajax up thyself, and young Phyleides.”"
7115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he on his shoulders cast a yellow lion’s hide,"
7116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Big, and reach’d earth; then took his spear, and Nestor’s will applied,"
7117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rais’d the heroes, brought them both. All met; the round they went,"
7118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And found not any captain there asleep or negligent,"
7119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But waking, and in arms, gave ear to ev’ry lowest sound."
7120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as keen dogs keep sheep in cotes, or folds of hurdles bound,"
7121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And grin at ev’ry breach of air, envious of all that moves,"
7122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Still list’ning when the rav’nous beast stalks through the hilly
7123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"groves,"
7124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then men and dogs stand on their guards, and mighty tumults make,"
7125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sleep wanting weight to close one wink; so did the captains wake,"
7126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That kept the watch the whole sad night, all with intentive ear"
7127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Converted to the enemies’ tents, that they might timely hear"
7128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If they were stirring to surprise; which Nestor joy’d to see.
7129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Why so, dear sons, maintain your watch, sleep not a wink,” said he,"
7130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Rather than make your fames the scorn of Trojan perjury.”
7131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he foremost passed the dike, the others seconded,"
7132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n all the kings that had been call’d to council from the bed,"
7133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And with them went Meriones, and Nestor’s famous son;"
7134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For both were call’d by all the kings to consultation.
7135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beyond the dike they choos’d a place, near as they could from blood,"
7136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where yet appear’d the falls of some, and whence, the crimson flood"
7137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Grecian lives being pour’d on earth by Hector’s furious chace,"
7138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He made retreat, when night repour’d grim darkness in his face."
7139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There sat they down, and Nestor spake: “O friends, remains not one"
7140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That will rely on his bold mind, and view the camp, alone,"
7141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of the proud Trojans, to approve if any straggling mate"
7142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He can surprise near th’ utmost tents, or learn the brief estate"
7143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of their intentions for the time, and mix like one of them"
7144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With their outguards, expiscating if the renown’d extreme"
7145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They force on us will serve their turns, with glory to retire,"
7146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or still encamp thus far from Troy? This may he well inquire,"
7147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And make a brave retreat untouch’d; and this would win him fame
7148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all men canopied with heav’n, and ev’ry man of name,"
7149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all this host shall honour him with an enriching meed,"
7150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A black ewe and her sucking lamb (rewards that now exceed
7151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All other best possessions, in all men’s choice requests)"
7152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And still be bidden by our kings to kind and royal feasts.”
7153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All rev’renc’d one another’s worth; and none would silence break,"
7154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lest worst should take best place of speech; at last did Diomed speak:
7155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Nestor, thou ask’st if no man here have heart so well inclin’d"
7156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To work this stratagem on Troy? Yes, I have such a mind."
7157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, if some other prince would join, more probable will be"
7158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The strengthen’d hope of our exploit. Two may together see
7159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(One going before another still) sly danger ev’ry way;
7160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One spirit upon another works, and takes with firmer stay"
7161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The benefit of all his pow’rs; for though one knew his course,"
7162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet might he well distrust himself, which the other might enforce.”"
7163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This offer ev’ry man assum’d, all would with Diomed go;"
7164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The two Ajaces, Merion, and Menelaus too;"
7165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Nestor’s son enforc’d it much; and hardy Ithacus,"
7166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who had to ev’ry vent’rous deed a mind as venturous.
7167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst all these thus spake the king: “Tydides, most belov’d,"
7168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Choose thy associate worthily; a man the most approv’d
7169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For use and strength in these extremes. Many thou seest stand forth;
7170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But choose not thou by height of place, but by regard of worth,"
7171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest with thy nice respect of right to any man’s degree,"
7172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou wrong’st thy venture, choosing one least fit to join with thee,"
7173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Although perhaps a greater king.” This spake he with suspect
7174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Diomed, for honour’s sake, his brother would select."
7175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then said Tydides: “Since thou giv’st my judgment leave to choose,"
7176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How can it so much truth forget Ulysses to refuse,"
7177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That bears a mind so most exempt, and vig’rous in th’ effect"
7178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all high labours, and a man Pallas doth most respect?"
7179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We shall return through burning fire, if I with him combine,"
7180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He sets strength in so true a course, with counsels so divine.”"
7181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, loth to be esteem’d a lover of his praise,"
7182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such exceptions humbled him as did him higher raise,"
7183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “Tydides, praise me not more than free truth will bear,"
7184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor yet impair me; they are Greeks that give judicial ear.
7185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But come, the morning hastes, the stars are forward in their course,"
7186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two parts of night are past, the third is left t’ employ our force.”"
7187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Now borrow’d they for haste some arms. Bold Thrasymedes lent
7188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Advent’rous Diomed his sword (his own was at his tent),"
7189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His shield, and helm tough and well-tann’d, without or plume or crest,"
7190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And call’d a murrion, archers’ heads it uséd to invest."
7191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Meriones lent Ithacus his quiver and his bow,"
7192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His helmet fashion’d of a hide; the workman did bestow
7193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much labour in it, quilting it with bow-strings, and, without"
7194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With snowy tusks of white-mouth’d boars ’twas arméd round about
7195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Right cunningly, and in the midst an arming cap was plac’d,"
7196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That with the fix’d ends of the tusks his head might not be ras’d.
7197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This, long since, by Autolycus was brought from Eleon,"

7226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor Hector let his princes sleep, but all to council call’d,"
7227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ask’d, “What one is here will vow, and keep it unappall’d,"
7228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To have a gift fit for his deed, a chariot and two horse,"

7235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This Dolon did in gold and brass exceedingly abound,"

7255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of horse and foot, he promptly runs, and as he runs he stoops"
7256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To undermine Achilles’ horse. Ulysses straight did see,"
7257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said to Diomed: “This man makes footing towards thee,"
7258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out of the tents. I know not well, if he be us’d as spy"
7259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bent to our fleet, or come to rob the slaughter’d enemy."
7260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But let us suffer him to come a little further on,"
7261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then pursue him. If it chance, that we be overgone"
7262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By his more swiftness, urge him still to run upon our fleet,"
7263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And (lest he ’scape us to the town) still let thy jav’lin meet
7264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With all his offers of retreat.” Thus stepp’d they from the plain
7265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the slaughter’d carcasses. Dolon came on amain,"
7266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Suspecting nothing; but once past, as far as mules outdraw"
7267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Oxen at plough, being both put on, neither admitted law,"
7268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To plough a deep-soil’d furrow forth, so far was Dolon past."
7269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then they pursu’d, which he perceiv’d, and stay’d his speedless haste,"
7270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Subtly supposing Hector sent to countermand his spy;
7271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, in a jav’lin’s throw or less, he knew them enemy."
7272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then laid he on his nimble knees, and they pursu’d like wind."
7273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As when a brace of greyhounds are laid in with hare and hind,"
7274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close-mouth’d and skill’d to make the best of their industrious course,"
7275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Serve either’s turn, and, set on hard, lose neither ground nor force;"
7276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So constantly did Tydeus’ son, and his town-razing peer,"
7277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pursue this spy, still turning him, as he was winding near"
7278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His covert, till he almost mix’d with their out-courts of guard."
7279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Pallas prompted Diomed, lest his due worth’s reward"
7280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should be impair’d if any man did vaunt he first did sheath
7281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sword in him, and he be call’d but second in his death."
7282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then spake he, threat’ning with his lance: “Or stay, or this comes on,"
7283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And long thou canst not run before thou be by death outgone.”
7284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he threw his jav’lin forth; which missed as Diomed would,"
7285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Above his right arm making way, the pile stuck in the mould."
7286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He stay’d and trembled, and his teeth did chatter in his head."
7287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They came in blowing, seiz’d him fast; he, weeping, offeréd"
7288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A wealthy ransom for his life, and told them he had brass,"
7289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much gold, and iron, that fit for use in many labours was,"
7290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From whose rich heaps his father would a wondrous portion give,"
7291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If, at the great Achaian fleet, he heard his son did live."
7292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses bad him cheer his heart. “Think not of death,” said he,"
7293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“But tell us true, why runn’st thou forth, when others sleeping be?"
7294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is it to spoil the carcasses? Or art thou choicely sent
7295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,T’ explore our drifts? Or of thyself seek’st thou some wish’d event?”
7296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He trembling answer’d: “Much reward did Hector’s oath propose,"
7297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And urg’d me, much against my will, t’ endeavour to disclose"
7298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If you determin’d still to stay, or bent your course for flight,"
7299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As all dismay’d with your late foil, and wearied with the fight."
7300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For which exploit, Pelides’ horse and chariot he did swear,"
7301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I only ever should enjoy.” Ulysses smil’d to hear
7302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So base a swain have any hope so high a prise t’ aspire,"
7303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said, his labours did affect a great and precious hire,"
7304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And that the horse Pelides rein’d no mortal hand could use
7305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But he himself, whose matchless life a Goddess did produce."
7306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“But tell us, and report but truth, where left’st thou Hector now?"
7307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where are his arms? His famous horse? On whom doth he bestow
7308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The watch’s charge? Where sleep the kings? Intend they still to lie
7309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus near encamp’d, or turn suffic’d with their late victory?”"
7310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“All this,” said he, “I’ll tell most true. At Ilus’ monument"
7311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hector with all our princes sits, t’ advise of this event;"
7312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who choose that place remov’d to shun the rude confuséd sounds
7313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The common soldiers throw about. But, for our watch, and rounds,"
7314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whereof, brave lord, thou mak’st demand, none orderly we keep."
7315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans, that have roofs to save, only abandon sleep,"
7316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And privately without command each other they exhort
7317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To make prevention of the worst; and in this slender sort
7318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is watch and guard maintain’d with us. Th’ auxiliary bands
7319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sleep soundly, and commit their cares into the Trojans’ hands,"
7320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For they have neither wives with them, nor children to protect;"
7321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The less they need to care, the more they succour dull neglect.”"
7322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“But tell me,” said wise Ithacus, “are all these foreign pow’rs"
7323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Appointed quarters by themselves, or else commix’d with yours?”"
7324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“And this,” said Dolon, “too, my lords, I’ll seriously unfold."
7325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Pæons with the crookéd bows, and Cares, quarters hold"
7326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Next to the sea, the Leleges, and Caucons, join’d with them,"
7327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And brave Pelasgians. Thymber’s mead, remov’d more from the stream,"
7328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is quarter to the Lycians, the lofty Mysian force,"
7329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Phrygians and Meonians, that fight with arméd horse."
7330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But what need these particulars? If ye intend surprise
7331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of any in our Trojan camps, the Thracian quarter lies"
7332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Utmost of all, and uncommix’d with Trojan regiments,"
7333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That keep the voluntary watch. New pitch’d are all their tents.
7334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"King Rhesus, Eioneus’ son, commands them, who hath steeds"
7335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More white than snow, huge, and well-shap’d, their fi’ry pace exceeds"
7336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The winds in swiftness; these I saw; his chariot is with gold
7337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And pallid silver richly fram’d, and wondrous to behold;"
7338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His great and golden armour is not fit a man should wear,"
7339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But for immortal shoulders fram’d. Come then, and quickly bear"
7340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your happy pris’ner to your fleet; or leave him here fast bound,"
7341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till your well-urg’d and rich return prove my relation sound.”
7342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tydides dreadfully replied: “Think not of passage thus,"
7343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though of right acceptable news thou hast advértised us,"
7344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our hands are holds more strict than so; and should we set thee free
7345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For offer’d ransom, for this ’scape thou still wouldst scouting be"
7346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About our ships, or do us scathe in plain opposed arms,"
7347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, if I take thy life, no way can we repent thy harms.”"
7348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this, as Dolon reach’d his hand to use a suppliant’s part,"
7349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And stroke the beard of Diomed, he strook his neck athwart"
7350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his forc’d sword, and both the nerves he did in sunder wound,"
7351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And suddenly his head, deceiv’d, fell speaking on the ground."
7352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His weasel’s helm they took, his bow, his wolf’s skin, and his lance,"
7353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which to Minerva Ithacus did zealously advance,"
7354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With lifted arm into the air; and to her thus he spake:
7355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Goddess, triumph in thine own spoils; to thee we first will make"
7356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our invocations, of all pow’rs thron’d on th’ Olympian hill;"
7357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now to the Thracians, and their horse, and beds, conduct us still.”"
7358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this, he hung them up aloft upon a tamrick bough"
7359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As eyeful trophies, and the sprigs that did about it grow"
7360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He proinéd from the leafy arms, to make it easier view’d"
7361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When they should hastily retire, and be perhaps pursu’d,"
7362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forth went they through black blood and arms, and presently aspir’d"
7363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The guardless Thracian regiment, fast bound with sleep, and tir’d;"
7364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their arms lay by, and triple ranks they, as they slept, did keep,"
7365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As they should watch and guard their king, who, in a fatal sleep,"
7366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lay in the midst; their chariot horse, as they coach-fellows were,"
7367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fed by them; and the famous steeds, that did their gen’ral bear,"
7368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood next him, to the hinder part of his rich chariot tied."
7369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses saw them first, and said, “Tydides, I have spied"
7370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The horse that Dolon, whom we slew, assur’d us we should see."
7371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Now use thy strength; now idle arms are most unfit for thee;
7372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prise thou the horse; or kill the guard, and leave the horse to me.”"
7373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva, with the azure eyes, breath’d strength into her king,"
7374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who filled the tent with mixéd death. The souls, he set on wing,"
7375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Issu’d in groans, and made air swell into her stormy flood."
7376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Horror and slaughter had one pow’r, the earth did blush with blood."
7377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As when a hungry lion flies, with purpose to devour,"
7378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On flocks unkept, and on their lives doth freely use his pow’r;"
7379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So Tydeus’ son assail’d the foe; twelve souls before him flew;
7380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses waited on his sword, and ever as he slew,"
7381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He drew them by their strengthless heels out of the horses’ sight.
7382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, when he was to lead them forth, they should not with affright"
7383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Boggle, nor snore, in treading on the bloody carcasses;"
7384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For being new come, they were unus’d to such stern sights as these."
7385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through four ranks now did Diomed the king himself attain,"
7386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, snoring in his sweetest sleep, was like his soldiers slain."
7387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An ill dream by Minerva sent that night stood by his head,"
7388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which was Oenides’ royal, unconquer’d Diomed."
7389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Meanwhile Ulysses loos’d his horse, took all their reins in hand,"
7390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And led them forth; but Tydeus’ son did in contention stand
7391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With his great mind to do some deed of more audacity;
7392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If he should take the chariot, where his rich arms did lie,"
7393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And draw it by the beam away, or bear it on his back,"
7394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or if, of more dull Thracian lives, he should their bosoms sack."
7395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this contention with himself, Minerva did suggest"
7396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And bade him think of his retreat; lest from their tempted rest
7397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some other God should stir the foe, and send him back dismay’d."
7398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He knew the voice, took horse, and fled. The Trojan’s heav’nly aid,"
7399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apollo with the silver bow, stood no blind sentinel"
7400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To their secure and drowsy host, but did discover well"
7401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva following Diomed; and, angry with his act,"
7402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mighty host of Ilion he enter’d, and awak’d"
7403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The cousin-german of the king, a counsellor of Thrace,"
7404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hippocoon; who when he rose, and saw the desert place,"
7405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where Rhesus’ horse did use to stand, and th’ other dismal harms,"
7406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Men struggling with the pangs of death, he shriek’d out thick alarms,"
7407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call’d “Rhesus! Rhesus!” but in vain; then still, “Arm! Arm!” he cried."
7408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The noise and tumult was extreme on every startled side
7409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Troy’s huge host; from whence in throngs all gather’d, and admir’d"
7410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who could perform such harmful facts, and yet be safe retir’d,"
7411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now, coming where they slew the scout, Ulysses stay’d the steeds,"
7412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tydides lighted, and the spoils, hung on the tamrick reeds,"
7413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took and gave to Ithacus, and up he got again."
7414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then flew they joyful to their fleet. Nestor did first attain
7415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sounds the horse-hoofs strook through air, and said: “My royal"
7416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,peers!
7417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Do I but dote, or say I true? Methinks about mine ears"
7418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sounds of running horses beat. O would to God they were
7419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our friends thus soon return’d with spoils! But I have hearty fear,"
7420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lest this high tumult of the foe doth their distress intend.”
7421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He scarce had spoke, when they were come. Both did from horse descend."
7422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All, with embraces and sweet words, to heav’n their worth did raise."
7423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Nestor spake: “Great Ithacus, ev’n heap’d with Grecian praise,"
7424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,How have you made these horse your prise? Pierc’d you the dang’rous
7425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"host,"
7426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where such gems stand? Or did some God your high attempts accost,"
7427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And honour’d you with this reward? Why, they be like the rays"
7428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sun effuseth. I have mix’d with Trojans all my days;
7429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now, I hope you will not say, I always lie aboard,"
7430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though an old soldier I confess; yet did all Troy afford
7431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Never the like to any sense that ever I possess’d.
7432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But some good God, no doubt, hath met, and your high valours bless’d,"
7433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For He that shadows heav’n with clouds loves both as his delights,"
7434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And She that supples earth with blood cannot forbear your sights.”
7435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses answer’d: “Honour’d sire, the willing Gods can give"
7436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Horse much more worth than these men yield, since in more pow’r they"
7437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,live.
7438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These horse are of the Thracian breed; their king, Tydides slew,"
7439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And twelve of his most trusted guard; and of that meaner crew
7440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A scout for thirteenth man we kill’d, whom Hector sent to spy"
7441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The whole estate of our designs, if bent to fight or fly.”"
7442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus, follow’d with whole troops of friends, they with applauses"
7443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,pass’d
7444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The spacious dike, and in the tent of Diomed they plac’d"
7445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The horse without contention, as his deserving’s meed,"
7446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, with his other horse set up, on yellow wheat did feed."
7447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Poor Dolon’s spoils Ulysses had; who shrin’d them on his stern,"
7448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As trophies vow’d to her that sent the good-aboding hern.
7449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then enter’d they the mere main sea, to cleanse their honour’d sweat"
7450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From off their feet, their thighs and necks; and, when their vehement"
7451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,heat
7452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was calm’d, and their swoln hearts refresh’d, more curious baths they"

7454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where od’rous and dissolving oils, they through their limbs diffus’d."
7455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then, taking breakfast, a big bowl, fill’d with the purest wine,"

7653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some fresh directors through the field, where least the púrsuit drives."
7654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thick fell the Trojans, much more sweet to vultures than their wives."
7655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Jove drew Hector from the darts, from dust, from death and blood,"

7660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet there they rested not; the king still cried, ‘Pursue! Pursue!’"
7661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all his unreprovéd hands did blood and dust imbrue.
7662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when they came to Scæa’s ports, and to the beech of Jove,"
7663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There made they stand; there ev’ry eye, fixed on each other, strove"
7664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who should outlook his mate amaz’d; through all the field they fled.

7667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His dreadful hunger, and his neck he first of all doth break,"
7668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then laps his blood and entrails up; so Agamemnon plied
7669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The manage of the Trojan chace, and still the last man died,"
7670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The other fled, a number fell by his imperial hand,"
7671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some grovelling downwards from their horse, some upwards strew’d the"

7673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"High was the fury of his lance. But, having beat them close"
7674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath their walls, the both worlds’ Sire did now again repose"
7675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On fountain-flowing Ida’s tops, being newly slid from heav’n,"
7676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And held a lightning in his hand; from thence this charge was giv’n

7683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then will I fill his arm with death, ev’n till he reach the fleet,"
7684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And peaceful night treads busy day beneath her sacred feet.”
7685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wind-foot swift Thaumantia obey’d, and us’d her wings"
7686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To famous Ilion, from the mount enchas’d with silver springs,"
7687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And found in his bright chariot the hardy Trojan knight,"
7688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whom she spake the words of Jove, and vanish’d from his sight."
7689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He leapt upon the sounding earth, and shook his lengthful dart,"
7690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ev’rywhere he breath’d exhorts, and stirr’d up ev’ry heart."
7691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A dreadful fight he set on foot. His soldiers straight turn’d head.
7692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks stood firm. In both the hosts, the field was perfected."
7693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Agamemnon, foremost still, did all his side exceed,"
7694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And would not be the first in name unless the first in deed.
7695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now sing, fair Presidents of verse, that in the heav’ns embow’r,"
7696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who first encounter’d with the king, of all the adverse pow’r."
7697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Iphidamas, Antenor’s son, ample and bigly set,"
7698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brought up in pasture-springing Thrace, that doth soft sheep beget,"
7699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In grave Cisseus’ noble house, that was his mother’s sire,"
7700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fair Theano; and when his breast was heighten’d with the fire

7704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ships he in Percope left, and came to Troy by land."
7705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now he tried the fame of Greece, encount’ring with the king,"
7706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who threw his royal lance and miss’d. Iphidamas did fling,"
7707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And strook him on the arming waist, beneath his coat of brass,"
7708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which forc’d him stay upon his arm, so violent it was,"
7709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet pierc’d it not his well-wrought zone, but when the lazy head"
7710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tried hardness with his silver waist, it turn’d again like lead."
7711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He follow’d, grasping the ground end, but with a lion’s wile"
7712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That wrests away a hunter’s staff, he caught it by the pile,"
7713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And pluck’d it from the caster’s hand, whom with his sword he strook"
7714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath the ear, and with his wound his timeless death he took."
7715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He fell and slept an iron sleep; wretched young man, he died,"
7716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Far from his newly-married wife, in aid of foreign pride,"
7717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And saw no pleasure of his love; yet was her jointure great,"
7718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An hundred oxen gave he her, and vow’d in his retreat"
7719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two thousand head of sheep and goats, of which he store did leave."
7720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much gave he of his love’s first-fruits, and nothing did receive."
7721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Coon (one that for his form might feast an amorous eye,"
7722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And elder brother of the slain) beheld this tragedy,"
7723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deep sorrow sat upon his eyes, and (standing laterally,"
7724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to the Gen’ral undiscern’d) his jav’lin he let fly,"
7725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That ’twixt his elbow and his wrist transfix’d his armless arm;
7726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The bright head shin’d on th’ other side. The unexpected harm
7727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Impress’d some horror in the king; yet so he ceas’d not fight,"
7728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But rush’d on Coon with his lance, who made what haste he might,"
7729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Seizing his slaughter’d brother’s foot, to draw him from the field,"
7730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And call’d the ablest to his aid, when under his round shield"
7731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The king’s brass jav’lin, as he drew, did strike him helpless dead;"
7732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who made Iphidamas the block, and cut off Coon’s head."
7733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus under great Atrides’ arm Antenor’s issue thriv’d,"
7734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, to suffice precisest fate, to Pluto’s mansion div’d."
7735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He with his lance, sword, mighty stones, pour’d his heroic wreak"
7736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On other squadrons of the foe, whiles yet warm blood did break"
7737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Through his cleft veins; but when the wound was quite exhaust and
7738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"crude,"
7739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The eager anguish did approve his princely fortitude.
7740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As when most sharp and bitter pangs distract a labouring dame,"
7741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which the divine Ilithyæ, that rule the painful frame"
7742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of human child-birth, pour on her; th’ Ilithyæ that are"
7743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The daughters of Saturnia; with whose extreme repair
7744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The woman in her travail strives to take the worst it gives,"
7745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With thought it must be, ’tis love’s fruit, the end for which she"
7746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"lives,"
7747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mean to make herself new born, what comforts will redound;"
7748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So Agamemnon did sustain the torment of his wound.
7749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then took he chariot, and to fleet bad haste his charioteer,"
7750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But first pour’d out his highest voice to purchase ev’ry ear:
7751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Princes and leaders of the Greeks, brave friends, now from our fleet"
7752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Do you expel this boist’rous sway. Jove will not let me meet
7753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Illustrate Hector, nor give leave that I shall end the day"
7754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In fight against the Ilion pow’r; my wound is in my way.”
7755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, his ready charioteer did scourge his spriteful horse,"
7756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That freely to the sable fleet perform’d their fi’ry course.
7757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To bear their wounded sovereign apart the martial thrust,"
7758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sprinkling their pow’rful breasts with foam, and snowing on the dust."
7759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Hector heard of his retreat, thus he for fame contends:"
7760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Trojans, Dardanians, Lycians, all my close-fighting friends,"
7761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Think what it is to be renown’d, be soldiers all of name,"
7762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our strongest enemy is gone, Jove vows to do us fame,"
7763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then in the Grecian faces drive your one-hoof’d violent steeds,"
7764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And far above their best be best, and glorify your deeds.”"
7765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus as a dog-giv’n hunter sets upon a brace of boars
7766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His white-tooth’d hounds, puffs, shouts, breathes terms, and on his"
7767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,emprese pours
7768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All his wild art to make them pinch; so Hector urg’d his host
7769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To charge the Greeks, and, he himself most bold and active most,"
7770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He brake into the heat of fight, as when a tempest raves,"
7771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stoops from the clouds, and all on heaps doth cuff the purple waves."
7772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who then was first, and last, he kill’d, when Jove did grace his deed?"
7773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Assæus, and Autonous, Opys, and Clytus’ seed"
7774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prince Dolops, and the honour’d sire of sweet Euryalus"
7775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Opheltes, Agelaus next, and strong Hipponous,"
7776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Orus, Æsymnus, all of name. The common soldiers fell,"
7777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As when the hollow flood of air in Zephyr’s cheeks doth swell,"
7778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And sparseth all the gather’d clouds white Notus’ pow’r did draw,"
7779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wraps waves in waves, hurls up the froth beat with a vehement flaw;"
7780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So were the common soldiers wrack’d in troops by Hector’s hand.
7781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then ruin had enforc’d such works as no Greeks could withstand,"
7782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then in their fleet they had been hous’d, had not Laertes’ son"
7783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stirr’d up the spirit of Diomed, with this impression:"
7784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Tydides, what do we sustain, forgetting what we are?"
7785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stand by me, dearest in my love. ’Twere horrible impair"
7786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For our two valours to endure a customary flight,"
7787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To leave our navy still engag’d, and but by fits to fight.”"
7788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: “I am bent to stay, and anything sustain;"
7789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But our delight to prove us men will prove but short and vain,"
7790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Jove makes Trojans instruments, and virtually then"
7791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wields arms himself. Our cross affairs are not ’twixt men and men.”
7792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, Thymbræus with his lance he tumbled from his horse,"
7793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Near his left nipple wounding him. Ulysses did enforce
7794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair Molion, minion to this king that Diomed subdu’d."
7795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both sent they thence till they return’d, who now the king pursu’d"
7796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And furrow’d through the thicken’d troops. As when two chaséd boars
7797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Turn head ’gainst kennels of bold hounds, and race way through their"
7798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,gores;
7799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So, turn’d from flight, the forward kings show’d Trojans backward"
7800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,death.
7801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor fled the Greeks, but by their wills, to get great Hector breath."
7802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then took they horse and chariot from two bold city foes,"
7803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Merops Percosius’ mighty sons. Their father could disclose,"
7804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beyond all men, hid auguries, and would not give consent"
7805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To their egression to these wars, yet wilfully they went,"
7806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Fates, that order sable death, enforc’d their tragedies."
7807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tydides slew them with his lance, and made their arms his prise."
7808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hypirochus, and Hippodus, Ulysses reft of light."
7809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Jove, that out of Ida look’d, then equalis’d the fight,"
7810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A Grecian for a Trojan then paid tribute to the Fates.
7811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet royal Diomed slew one, ev’n in those even debates,"
7812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That was of name more than the rest, Pæon’s renownéd son,"
7813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The prince Agastrophus; his lance into his hip did run;
7814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His squire detain’d his horse apart, that hinder’d him to fly,"
7815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which he repented at his heart, yet did his feet apply"
7816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ’scape with all the speed they had alongst the foremost bands,"
7817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And there his lovéd life dissolv’d. This Hector understands,"
7818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And rush’d with clamour on the king, right soundly seconded"
7819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With troops of Trojans. Which perceiv’d by famous Diomed,"
7820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The deep conceit of Jove’s high will stiffen’d his royal hair,"
7821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who spake to near-fought Ithacus: “The fate of this affair
7822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is bent to us. Come let us stand, and bound his violence.”"
7823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus threw he his long jav’lin forth, which smote his head’s defence"
7824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Full on the top, yet pierc’d no skin; brass took repulse with brass;"
7825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His helm (with three folds made, and sharp) the gift of Phœbus was."
7826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The blow made Hector take the troop, sunk him upon his hand,"
7827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And strook him blind. The king pursu’d before the foremost band
7828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His dart’s recov’ry, which he found laid on the purple plain;"
7829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By which time Hector was reviv’d, and, taking horse again,"
7830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was far commix’d within his strength, and fled his darksome grave."
7831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He follow’d with his thirsty lance, and this elusive brave:"
7832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Once more be thankful to thy heels, proud dog, for thy escape."
7833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Mischief sat near thy bosom now; and now another rape
7834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath thy Apollo made of thee, to whom thou well mayst pray,"
7835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When through the singing of our darts thou find’st such guarded way.
7836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But I shall meet with thee at length, and bring thy latest hour,"
7837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If with like favour any God be fautour of my pow’r.
7838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Meanwhile some other shall repay, what I suspend in thee.”"
7839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he set the wretched soul of Pæon’s issue free,"
7840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom his late wound not fully slew. But Priam’s amorous birth
7841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against Tydides bent his bow, hid with a hill of earth,"
7842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Part of the ruinated tomb for honour’d Ilus built,"
7843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as the curace of the slain, engrav’n and richly gilt,"
7844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tydides from his breast had spoil’d, and from his shoulders raft"
7845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His target and his solid helm, he shot, and his keen shaft"
7846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(That never flew from him in vain) did nail unto the ground
7847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The king’s right foot; the spleenful knight laugh’d sweetly at the
7848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"wound,"
7849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Crept from his covert, and triumph’d: “Now art thou maim’d,” said he,"
7850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“And would to God my happy hand had so much honour’d me
7851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To have infix’d it in thy breast, as deep as in thy foot,"
7852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n to th’ expulsure of thy soul! Then blest had been my shoot
7853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the Trojans; who had then breath’d from their long unrests.
7854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who fear thee, as the braying goats abhor the king of beasts.”"
7855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Undaunted Diomed replied: “You braver with your bow,"
7856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You slick-hair’d lover, you that hunt and fleer at wenches so,"
7857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Durst thou but stand in arms with me, thy silly archery"
7858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would give thee little cause to vaunt. As little suffer I
7859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this same tall exploit of thine, perform’d when thou wert hid,"
7860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As if a woman, or a child that knew not what it did,"
7861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had touch’d my foot. A coward’s steel hath never any edge.
7862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But mine, t’ assure it sharp, still lays dead carcasses in pledge;"
7863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Touch it, it renders lifeless straight, it strikes the fingers’ ends"
7864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of hapless widows in their cheeks, and children blind of friends."
7865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The subject of it makes earth red, and air with sighs inflames,"
7866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And leaves limbs more embrac’d with birds than with enamour’d dames.”
7867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lance-fam’d Ulysses now came in, and stept before the king,"
7868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kneel’d opposite, and drew the shaft. The eager pain did sting"
7869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through all his body. Straight he took his royal chariot there,"
7870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with direction to the fleet did charge his charioteer.
7871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now was Ulysses desolate, fear made no friend remain,"
7872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He thus spake to his mighty mind: “What doth my state sustain?
7873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If I should fly this odds in fear, that thus comes clust’ring on,"
7874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Twere high dishonour; yet ’twere worse, to be surpris’d alone."
7875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,’Tis Jove that drives the rest to fight; but that’s a faint excuse.
7876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Why do I tempt my mind so much? Pale cowards fight refuse.
7877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He that affects renown in war must like a rock be fix’d,"
7878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wound, or be wounded. Valour’s truth puts no respect betwixt.”"
7879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this contention with himself, in flew the shady bands"
7880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of targeteers, who sieg’d him round with mischief-filléd hands."
7881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As when a crew of gallants watch the wild muse of a boar,"
7882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their dogs put after in full cry, he rusheth on before,"
7883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whets, with his lather-making jaws, his crookéd tusks for blood,"
7884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, holding firm his usual haunts, breaks through the deepen’d wood,"
7885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They charging, though his hot approach be never so abhorr’d;"
7886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So, to assail the Jove-lov’d Greek, the Ilians did accord,"
7887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he made through them. First he hurt, upon his shoulder blade,"
7888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deiops, a blameless man at arms; then sent to endless shade"
7889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thoon and Eunomus; and strook the strong Chersidamas,"
7890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As from his chariot he leap’d down, beneath his targe of brass;"
7891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who fell, and crawl’d upon the earth with his sustaining palms,"
7892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And left the fight. Nor yet his lance left dealing martial alms,"
7893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Socus’ brother by both sides, young Carops, did impress."
7894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then princely Socus to his aid made brotherly access,"
7895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, coming near, spake in his charge: “O great Laertes’ son,"
7896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Insatiate in sly stratagems, and labours never done,"
7897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This hour, or thou shalt boast to kill the two Hippasides"
7898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And prise their arms, or fall thyself in my resolv’d access.”"
7899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he threw quite through his shield his fell and well-driv’n"
7900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"lance,"
7901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which held way through his curaces, and on his ribs did glance,"
7902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Plowing the flesh alongst his sides; but Pallas did repel
7903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All inward passage to his life. Ulysses, knowing well"
7904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wound undeadly (setting back his foot to form his stand)
7905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus spake to Socus: “O thou wretch, thy death is in this hand,"
7906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That stay’st my victory on Troy, and where thy charge was made"
7907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In doubtful terms (or this or that) this shall thy life invade.”
7908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This frighted Socus to retreat, and, in his faint reverse,"
7909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The lance betwixt his shoulders fell, and through his breast did perse,"
7910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down fell he sounding, and the king thus play’d with his mis-ease:"
7911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Socus, you that make by birth the two Hippasides,"
7912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Now may your house and you perceive death can outfly the flyer.
7913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ah wretch! thou canst not ’scape my vows. Old Hippasus thy sire,"
7914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor thy well-honour’d mother’s hands, in both which lies thy worth,"
7915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall close thy wretched eyes in death, but vultures dig them forth,"
7916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And hide them with their darksome wings; but when Ulysses dies,"
7917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Divinest Greeks shall tomb my corse with all their obsequies.”
7918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now from his body and his shield the violent lance he drew,"
7919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That princely Socus had infix’d; which drawn, a crimson dew"
7920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fell from his bosom on the earth; the wound did dare him sore.
7921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And when the furious Trojans saw Ulysses’ forcéd gore,"
7922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Encouraging themselves in gross, all his destruction vow’d."
7923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then he retir’d, and summon’d aid. Thrice shouted he aloud,"
7924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As did denote a man engag’d. Thrice Menelaus’ ear
7925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Observ’d his aid-suggesting voice, and Ajax being near,"
7926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He told him of Ulysses’ shouts, as if he were enclos’d"
7927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From all assistance, and advis’d their aids might be dispos’d"
7928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the ring that circled him, lest, charg’d with troops alone,"
7929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Though valiant) he might be oppress’d, whom Greece so built upon."
7930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He led, and Ajax seconded. They found their Jove-lov’d king"
7931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Circled with foes. As when a den of bloody lucerns cling
7932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About a goodly-palméd hart, hurt with a hunter’s bow,"
7933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose ’scape his nimble feet enforce, whilst his warm blood doth flow,"
7934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And his light knees have pow’r to move; but, master’d of his wound,"
7935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Emboss’d within a shady hill, the lucerns charge him round,"
7936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And tear his flesh; when instantly fortune sends in the pow’rs
7937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of some stern lion, with whose sight they fly, and he devours;"
7938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So charged the Ilians Ithacus, many and mighty men."
7939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But then made Menelaus in, and horrid Ajax then,"
7940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bearing a target like a tow’r, close was his violent stand,"
7941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And every way the foe dispers’d, when, by the royal hand,"
7942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kind Menelaus led away the hurt Laertes’ son,"
7943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till his fair squire had brought his horse. Victorious Telamon
7944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still plied the foe, and put to sword a young Priamides,"
7945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Doryclus, Priam’s bastard son; then did his lance impress"
7946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pandocus, and strong Pirasus, Lysander and Palertes."
7947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As when a torrent from the hills, swoln with Saturnian show’rs,"
7948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Falls on the fields, bears blasted oaks, and wither’d rosin flow’rs,"
7949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Loose weeds, and all disperséd filth, into the ocean’s force;"
7950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So matchless Ajax beat the field, and slaughter’d men and horse."
7951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet had not Hector heard of this, who fought on the left wing"
7952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the host, near those sweet herbs Scamander’s flood doth spring,"
7953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where many foreheads trod the ground, and where the skirmish burn’d"
7954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Near Nestor and king Idomen, where Hector over turn’d"
7955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Grecian squadrons, authoring high service with his lance,"
7956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And skilful manage of his horse. Nor yet the discrepance
7957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He made in death betwixt the hosts had made the Greeks retire,"
7958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If fair-hair’d Helen’s second spouse had not repress’d the fire
7959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of bold Machaon’s fortitude, who with a three-fork’d head"
7960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In his right shoulder wounded him. Then had the Grecians dread.
7961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest, in his strength declin’d, the foe should slaughter their hurt"
7962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,friend.
7963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Crete’s king urg’d Neleides his chariot to ascend,"
7964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And getting near him, take him in, and bear him to their tents."
7965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A surgeon is to be preferr’d, with physic ornaments,"
7966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before a multitude; his life gives hurt lives native bounds,"
7967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With sweet inspersion of fit balms, and perfect search of wounds."
7968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus spake the royal Idomen. Neleides obey’d,"
7969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to his chariot presently the wounded Greek convey’d,"
7970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The son of Æsculapius, the great physician."
7971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To fleet they flew. Cebriones perceiv’d the slaughter done
7972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Ajax on the other troops, and spake to Hector thus:"
7973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Whiles we encounter Grecians here, stern Telamonius"
7974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is yonder raging, turning up in heaps our horse and men;"
7975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I know him by his spacious shield. Let us turn chariot then,"
7976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where, both of horse and foot, the fight most hotly is propos’d,"
7977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In mutual slaughters. Hark, their throats from cries are never clos’d.”"
7978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, with his shrill scourge he strook the horse, that fast"
7979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,ensu’d
7980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stung with his lashes, tossing shields, and carcasses imbru’d."
7981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The chariot tree was drown’d in blood, and th’ arches by the seat"
7982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Disperpled from the horses’ hoofs, and from the wheel bands beat."
7983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Hector long’d to break the ranks, and startle their close fight,"
7984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who horribly amaz’d the Greeks, and plied their sudden fright"
7985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With busy weapons, ever wing’d; his lance, sword, weighty stones."
7986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet charg’d he other leader’s hands, not dreadful Telamon’s;"
7987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With whom he wisely shunn’d foul blows. But Jove (that weighs above
7988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All human pow’rs) to Ajax’ breast divine repressions drove,"
7989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And made him shun who shunn’d himself; he ceas’d from fight amaz’d,"
7990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cast on his back his sev’n-fold shield, and round about him gaz’d"
7991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like one turn’d wild, look’d on himself in his distract retreat,"
7992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Knee before knee did scarcely move. As when from herds of neat,"
7993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whole threaves of boors and mongrels chase a lion skulking near,"
7994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Loth he should taint the well-prized fat of any stall-fed steer,"
7995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Consuming all the night in watch, he, greedy of his prey,"
7996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Oft thrusting on is oft thrust off, so thick the jav’lins play"
7997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his bold charges, and so hot the burning fire-brands shine,"
7998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which he (though horrible) abhors, about his glowing eyne,"
7999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And early his great heart retires; so Ajax from the foe,"
8000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For fear their fleet should be inflam’d, ’gainst his swoln heart did"
8001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,go.
8002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As when a dull mill ass comes near a goodly field of corn,"
8003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kept from the birds by children’s cries, the boys are overborne"
8004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By his insensible approach, and simply he will eat;"
8005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About whom many wands are broke, and still the children beat,"
8006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And still the self-providing ass doth with their weakness bear,"
8007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not stirring till his paunch be full, and scarcely then will steer;"
8008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So the huge son of Telamon amongst the Trojans far’d,"
8009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bore show’rs of darts upon his shield, yet scorn’d to fly as scar’d,"
8010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And so kept softly on his way; nor would he mend his pace
8011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all their violent pursuits, that still did arm the chace"
8012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With singing lances. But, at last, when their cur-like presumes"
8013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More urg’d the more forborne, his spirits did rarify their fumes,"
8014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he revok’d his active strength, turn’d head, and did repell"
8015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The horse-troops that were new made in, ’twixt whom the fight grew"
8016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,fell;
8017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And by degrees he stole retreat, yet with such puissant stay"
8018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That none could pass him to the fleet. In both the armies’ sway
8019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He stood, and from strong hands receiv’d sharp jav’lins on his shield,"
8020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where many stuck, thrown on before, many fell short in field,"
8021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ere the white body they could reach, and stuck, as telling how"
8022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They purpos’d to have pierc’d his flesh. His peril piercéd now
8023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The eyes of prince Eurypylus, Evemon’s famous son,"
8024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who came close on, and with his dart strook duke Apisaon,"
8025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose surname was Phausiades, ev’n to the concrete blood"
8026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That makes the liver; on the earth, out gush’d his vital flood."
8027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eurypylus made in, and eas’d his shoulders of his arms;"
8028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which Paris seeing, he drew his bow, and wreak’d in part the harms"
8029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his good friend Phausiades, his arrow he let fly"
8030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That smote Eurypylus, and brake in his attainted thigh;"
8031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then took he troop to shun black death, and to the flyers cried:"
8032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Princes, and leaders of the Greeks, stand, and repulse the tide"
8033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of this our honour-wracking chace. Ajax is drown’d in darts,"
8034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I fear past ’scape; turn, honour’d friends, help out his vent’rous"
8035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,parts.”
8036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus spake the wounded Greek; the sound cast on their backs their
8037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"shields,"
8038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And rais’d their darts; to whose relief Ajax his person wields.
8039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then stood he firmly with his friends, retiring their retire."
8040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus both hosts indiff’rent join’d, the fight grew hot as fire."
8041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now had Neleides’ sweating steeds brought him, and his hurt friend,"
8042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst their fleet. Æacides, that wishly did intend,"
8043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Standing astern his tall-neck’d ship, how deep the skirmish drew"
8044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the Greeks, and with what ruth the insecution grew,"
8045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Saw Nestor bring Machaon hurt, and from within did call"
8046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His friend Patroclus; who, like Mars in form celestial,"
8047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Came forth with first sound of his voice, first spring of his decay,"
8048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ask’d his princely friend’s desire. “Dear friend,” said he, “this"
8049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,day
8050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I doubt not will enforce the Greeks, to swarm about my knees;"
8051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I see unsuffer’d need employ’d in their extremities.
8052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go, sweet Patroclus, and inquire of old Neleides"
8053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom he brought wounded from the fight; by his back parts I guess
8054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It is Machaon, but his face I could not well descry,"
8055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They pass’d me in such earnest speed.” Patroclus presently
8056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Obey’d his friend, and ran to know. They now descended were,"
8057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Nestor’s squire, Eurymedon, the horses did ungear;"
8058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Themselves stood near th’ extremest shore, to let the gentle air"
8059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Dry up their sweat; then to the tent where Hecamed the fair
8060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Set chairs, and for the wounded prince a potion did prepare."
8061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This Hecamed, by war’s hard fate, fell to old Nestor’s share,"
8062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When Thetis’ son sack’d Tenedos; she was the princely seed
8063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of worthy king Arsinous, and by the Greeks decreed"
8064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prise of Nestor, since all men in counsel he surpass’d."
8065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First, a fair table she appos’d, of which the feet were grac’d"
8066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With bluish metal mix’d with black; and on the same she put
8067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A brass fruit-dish, in which she serv’d a wholesome onion cut"
8068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For pittance to the potion, and honey newly wrought,"
8069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bread, the fruit of sacred meal. Then to the board she brought"
8070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A right fair cup with gold studs driv’n, which Nestor did transfer"
8071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Pylos; on whose swelling sides four handles fixéd were,"
8072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And upon ev’ry handle sat a pair of doves of gold,"
8073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some billing, and some pecking meat; two gilt feet did uphold"
8074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The antique body; and withal so weighty was the cup
8075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, being propos’d brimful of wine, one scarce could lift it up,"
8076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet Nestor drunk in it with ease, spite of his years’ respect."
8077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In this the goddess-like fair dame a potion did confect
8078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With good old wine of Pramnius, and scrap’d into the wine"
8079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cheese made of goat’s milk, and on it spers’d flour exceeding fine."
8080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this sort for the wounded lord the potion she prepar’d,"
8081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bad him drink. For company, with him old Nestor shar’d."
8082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus physically quench’d they thirst, and then their spirits reviv’d"
8083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With pleasant conference. And now Patroclus, being arriv’d,"
8084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made stay at th’ entry of the tent. Old Nestor, seeing it,"
8085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rose, and receiv’d him by the hand, and fain would have him sit."
8086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He set that courtesy aside, excusing it with haste,"
8087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since his much-to-be-rev’renced friend sent him to know who past,"
8088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wounded with him in chariot, so swiftly through the shore;"
8089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Whom now,” said he, “I see and know, and now can stay no more;"
8090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You know, good father, our great friend is apt to take offence,"
8091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose fi’ry temper will inflame sometimes with innocence.”
8092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He answer’d: “When will Peleus’ son some royal pity show
8093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On his thus wounded countrymen? Ah! is he yet to know
8094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How much affliction tires our host? How our especial aid,"
8095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tainted with lances, at their tents are miserably laid?"
8096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses, Diomed, our king, Eurypylus, Machaon,"
8097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All hurt, and all our worthiest friends; yet no compassion"
8098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Can supple thy friend’s friendless breast! Doth he reserve his eye
8099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till our fleet burn, and we ourselves one after other die?"
8100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alas, my forces are not now as in my younger life."
8101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Oh would to God I had that strength I uséd in the strife
8102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Betwixt us and the Elians, for oxen to be driv’n,"
8103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When Itymonius’ lofty soul was by my valour giv’n
8104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As sacrifice to destiny, Hypirochus’ strong son,"
8105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That dwelt in Elis, and fought first in our contention!"
8106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We forag’d, as proclaiméd foes, a wondrous wealthy boot,"
8107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he, in rescue of his herds, fell breathless at my foot."
8108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All the dorp boors with terror fled. Our prey was rich and great;
8109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Twice five and twenty flocks of sheep; as many herds of neat;
8110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As many goats, and nasty swine; an hundred fifty mares,"
8111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All sorrel, most with sucking foals. And these soon-monied wares"
8112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We drave into Neleius’ town, fair Pylos, all by night."
8113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My father’s heart was glad to see so much good fortune quite
8114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The forward mind of his young son, that us’d my youth in deeds,"
8115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And would not smother it in moods. Now drew the Sun’s bright steeds
8116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Light from the hills; our heralds now accited all that were
8117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Endamag’d by the Elians; our princes did appear;
8118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our boot was parted; many men th’ Epeians much did owe,"
8119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, being our neighbours, they did spoil; afflictions did so flow"
8120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On us poor Pylians, though but few. In brake great Hercules"
8121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To our sad confines of late years, and wholly did suppress"
8122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our hapless princes. Twice-six Sons renown’d Neleius bred,"
8123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Only myself am left of all, the rest subdu’d and dead."
8124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And this was it that made so proud the base Epeian bands,"
8125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On their near neighbours, being oppress’d, to lay injurious hands."
8126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A herd of oxen for himself, a mighty flock of sheep,"
8127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My sire selected, and made choice of shepherds for their keep;"
8128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And from the gen’ral spoil he cull’d three hundred of the best.
8129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Elians ought him infinite, most plagu’d of all the rest."
8130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Four wager-winning horse he lost, and chariots intervented,"
8131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Being led to an appointed race; the prize that was presented
8132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was a religious three-foot urn; Augeas was the king
8133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That did detain them, and dismiss’d their keeper sorrowing"
8134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For his lov’d charge lost with foul words. Then both for words and
8135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,deeds
8136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My sire being worthily incens’d, thus justly he proceeds"
8137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To satisfaction, in first choice of all our wealthy prise;"
8138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, as he shar’d much, much he left his subjects to suffice,"
8139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That none might be oppress’d with pow’r, or want his portion due."
8140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus for the public good we shar’d. Then we to temples drew
8141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our cómplete city, and to heav’n we thankful rites did burn"
8142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For our rich conquest. The third day ensuing our return
8143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Elians flew on us in heaps; their gen’ral leaders were
8144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The two Moliones, two boys, untrainéd in the fear"
8145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of horrid war, or use of strength. A certain city shines"
8146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon a lofty prominent, and in th’ extreme confines"
8147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of sandy Pylos, seated where Alpheus’ flood doth run,"
8148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And call’d Thryessa; this they sieg’d, and gladly would have won,"
8149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, having pass’d through all our fields, Minerva as our spy"
8150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fell from Olympus in the night, and arm’d us instantly;"
8151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor muster’d she unwilling men, nor unprepar’d for force."
8152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My sire yet would not let me arm, but hid away my horse,"
8153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Esteeming me no soldier yet; yet shin’d I nothing less
8154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst our gallants, though on foot; Minerva’s mightiness"
8155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Led me to fight, and made me bear a soldier’s worthy name."
8156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There is a flood falls into sea, and his crook’d course doth frame"
8157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close to Arena, and is call’d bright Minyæus’ stream."
8158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There made we halt, and there the sun cast many a glorious beam"
8159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On our bright armours, horse and foot insea’d together there."
8160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then march’d we on. By fi’ry noon we saw the sacred clear
8161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of great Alpheus, where to Jove we did fair sacrifice;"
8162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to the azure God, that rules the under-liquid skies,"
8163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We offer’d up a solemn bull; a bull t’ Alpheus’ name;
8164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to the blue-ey’d Maid we burn’d a heifer never tame.
8165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now was it night; we supp’d and slept, about the flood, in arms."
8166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The foe laid hard siege to our town, and shook it with alarms,"
8167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, for prevention of their spleens, a mighty work of war"
8168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Appear’d behind them; for as soon as Phœbus’ fi’ry car
8169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cast night’s foul darkness from his wheels (invoking rev’rend Jove,"
8170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And the unconquer’d Maid his birth) we did th’ event approve,"
8171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And gave them battle. First of all, I slew (the army saw)"
8172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mighty soldier Mulius, Augeas’ son-in-law,"
8173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And spoil’d him of his one hoof’d horse; his eldest daughter was
8174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bright Agamede, that for skill in simples did surpass,"
8175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And knew as many kind of drugs, as earth’s broad centre bred."
8176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Him charg’d I with my brass-arm’d lance, the dust receiv’d him dead."
8177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I, leaping to his chariot, amongst the foremost press’d,"
8178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And the great-hearted Elians fled frighted, seeing their best"
8179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And loftiest soldier taken down, the gen’ral of their horse."
8180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I follow’d like a black whirlwind, and did for prise enforce"
8181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Full fifty chariots, ev’ry one furnish’d with two arm’d men,"
8182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who ate the earth, slain with my lance. And I had slaughter’d then"
8183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The two young boys, Moliones, if their world-circling sire,"
8184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Neptune, had not saft their lives, and cover’d their retire"
8185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With unpierc’d clouds. Then Jove bestow’d a haughty victory
8186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon us Pylians; for so long we did the chace apply,"
8187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Slaught’ring and making spoil of arms, till sweet Buprasius’ soil,"
8188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alesius, and Olenia, were fam’d with our recoil;"
8189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For there Minerva turn’d our pow’r, and there the last I slew"
8190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As, when our battle join’d, the first. The Pylians then withdrew"
8191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Pylas from Buprasius. Of all th’ Immortals then,"
8192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They most thank’d Jove for victory; Nestor the most of men.
8193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such was I ever, if I were employ’d with other peers,"
8194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I had honour of my youth, which dies not in my years."
8195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And great Achilles only joys hability of act
8196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his brave prime, and doth not deign t’ impart it where ’tis lack’d."
8197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No doubt he will extremely mourn, long after that black hour"
8198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wherein our ruin shall be brought, and rue his ruthless pow’r,"
8199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,O friend! my memory revives the charge Menœtius gave
8200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy towardness, when thou sett’st forth, to keep out of the grave"
8201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our wounded honour. I myself and wise Ulysses were
8202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within the room, where ev’ry word then spoken we did hear,"
8203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For we were come to Peleus’ court, as we did must’ring pass"
8204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through rich Achaia, where thy sire, Menœtius, was,"
8205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thyself and great Æacides, when Peleüs the king"
8206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thunder-loving Jove did burn an ox for offering,"
8207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his court-yard. A cup of gold, crown’d with red wine, he held"
8208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On th’ holy incensory pour’d. You, when the ox was fell’d,"
8209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were dressing his divided limbs; we in the portal stood.
8210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles seeing us come so near, his honourable blood"
8211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was strook with a respective shame, rose, took us by the hands,"
8212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brought us both in, and made us sit, and us’d his kind commands"
8213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For seemly hospitable rites, which quickly were appos’d."
8214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then, after needfulness of food, I first of all disclos’d"
8215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The royal cause of our repair; mov’d you and your great friend
8216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To consort our renown’d designs; both straight did condescend.
8217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your fathers knew it, gave consent, and grave instruction"
8218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To both your valours. Peleus charg’d his most unequall’d son
8219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To govern his victorious strength, and shine past all the rest"
8220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In honour, as in mere main force. Then were thy partings blest"
8221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With dear advices from thy sire; ‘My lovéd son,’ said he,"
8222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Achilles, by his grace of birth, superior is to thee,"
8223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And for his force more excellent, yet thou more ripe in years;"
8224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then with sound counsels, age’s fruits, employ his honour’d years,"
8225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Command and overrule his moods; his nature will obey
8226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In any charge discreetly giv’n, that doth his good assay.’"
8227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Thus charg’d thy sire, which thou forgett’st. Yet now at last approve,"
8228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With forcéd reference of these, th’ attraction of his love;"
8229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who knows if sacred influence may bless thy good intent,"
8230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And enter with thy gracious words, ev’n to his full consent?"
8231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The admonition of a friend is sweet and vehement.
8232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If any oracle he shun, or if his mother-queen"
8233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath brought him some instinct from Jove, that fortifies his spleen,"
8234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let him resign command to thee of all his Myrmidons,"
8235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yield by that means some repulse to our confusions,"
8236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Adorning thee in his bright arms, that his resembled form"
8237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May haply make thee thought himself, and calm this hostile storm;"
8238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That so a little we may ease our overchargéd hands,"
8239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Draw some breath, not expire it all. The foe but faintly stands"
8240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath his labours; and your charge being fierce, and freshly giv’n,"
8241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They eas’ly from our tents and fleet may to their walls be driv’n.”
8242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This mov’d the good Patroclus’ mind; who made his utmost haste
8243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ inform his friend; and as the fleet of Ithacus he past,"
8244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(At which their markets were dispos’d, councils, and martial courts,"
8245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And where to th’ altars of the Gods they made divine resorts)
8246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He met renown’d Eurypylus, Evemon’s noble son,"
8247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Halting, his thigh hurt with a shaft, the liquid sweat did run"
8248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down from his shoulders and his brows, and from his raging wound"
8249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forth flow’d his melancholy blood, yet still his mind was sound."
8250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sight in kind Patroclus’ breast to sacred pity turn’d,"
8251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And (nothing more immartial for true ruth) thus he mourn’d:
8252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Ah wretched progeny of Greece, princes, dejected kings,"
8253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was it your fates to nourish beasts, and serve the outcast wings"
8254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of savage vultures here in Troy? Tell me, Evemon’s fame,"
8255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Do yet the Greeks withstand his force, whom yet no force can tame?"
8256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or are they hopeless thrown to death by his resistless lance?”
8257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Divine Patroclus,” he replied, “no more can Greece advance"
8258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Defensive weapons, but to fleet they headlong must retire,"
8259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For those that to this hour have held our fleet from hostile fire,"
8260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And are the bulwarks of our host, lie wounded at their tents,"
8261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Troy’s unvanquishable pow’r, still as it toils augments."
8262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But take me to thy black-stern’d ship, save me, and from my thigh"
8263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cut out this arrow, and the blood, that is ingor’d and dry,"
8264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wash with warm water from the wound; then gentle salves apply,"
8265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which thou know’st best, thy princely friend hath taught thee surgery,"
8266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom, of all Centaurs the most just, Chiron did institute."
8267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus to thy honourable hands my ease I prosecute,"
8268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since our physicians cannot help. Machaon at his tent
8269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Needs a physician himself, being leech and patient;"
8270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Podalirius, in the field, the sharp conflict sustains.”"
8271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Strong Menœtiades replied: “How shall I ease thy pains?
8272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What shall we do, Eurypylus? I am to use all haste,"
8273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To signify to Thetis’ son occurrents that have past,"
8274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At Nestor’s honourable suit. But be that work achiev’d
8275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When this is done, I will not leave thy torments unrelieved.”"
8276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, athwart his back he cast, beneath his breast, his arm,"
8277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And nobly help’d him to his tent. His servants, seeing his harm,"
8278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dispread ox-hides upon the earth, whereon Machaon lay."
8279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus cut out the sharp shaft, and clearly wash’d away"
8280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With lukewarm water the black blood; then ’twixt his hands he bruis’d
8281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A sharp and mitigatory root; which when he had infus’d
8282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Into the green, well-cleansed, wound, the pains he felt before"
8283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were well, and instantly allay’d; the wound did bleed no more."

8379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With stakes exceeding thick, sharp, strong, that horse could never"
8380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"pass,"
8381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Much less their chariots after them; yet for the foot there was
8382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some hopeful service, which they wish’d. Polydamas then spake:"
8383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Hector, and all our friends of Troy, we indiscreetly make"
8384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Offer of passage with our horse; ye see the stakes, the wall,"
8385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Impossible for horse to take; nor can men fight at all,"
8386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The place being strait, and much more apt to let us take our bane"
8387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than give the enemy. And yet, if Jove decree the wane"

8389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That we may freely charge them thus, and then will take our parts,"
8390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I would with all speed wish th’ assault, that ugly shame might shed"
8391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Thus far from home) these Grecians’ bloods. But, if they once turn"

8393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And sally on us from their fleet, when in so deep a dike"
8394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We shall lie struggling, not a man of all our host is like"
8395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To live and carry back the news. And therefore be it thus:
8396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Here leave we horse kept by our men, and all on foot let us"
8397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hold close together, and attend the grace of Hector’s guide,"
8398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then they shall not bear our charge, our conquest shall be dyed"
8399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In their lives’ purples.” This advice pleas’d Hector, for ’twas sound;"
8400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who first obey’d it, and full-arm’d betook him to the ground."
8401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then all left their chariots when he was seen to lead,"
8402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rushing about him, and gave up each chariot and steed"
8403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To their directors to be kept, in all procinct of war,"
8404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There, and on that side of the dike. And thus the rest prepare"
8405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their onset: In five regiments they all their pow’r divide,"
8406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Each regiment allow’d three chiefs. Of all which ev’n the pride

8408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Their passage beaten through the wall) with hazardous desire
8409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That they might once but fight at fleet. With Hector captains were
8410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Polydamas, and Cebriones, who was his charioteer;"
8411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But Hector found that place a worse. Chiefs of the second band
8412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were Paris and Alcathous, Agenor. The command"
8413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The third strong phalanx had, was giv’n to th’ augur Helenus,"
8414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deiphobus, that god-like man, and mighty Asius,"
8415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n Asius Hyrtacides, that from Arisba rode"
8416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The huge bay horse, and had his house where river Selleës flow’d."
8417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fourth charge good Æneas led, and with him were combin’d"
8418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Archelochus, and Acamas, Antenor’s dearest kind,"
8419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And excellent at ev’ry fight. The fifth brave company
8420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sarpedon had to charge, who choos’d, for his command’s supply,"
8421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Asteropseus great in arms, and Glaucus; for both these"
8422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were best of all men but himself, but he was fellowless."
8423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus fitted with their well-wrought shields, down the steep dike they"
8424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"go,"
8425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And (thirsty of the wall’s assault) believe in overthrow,"
8426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not doubting but with headlong falls to tumble down the Greeks
8427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From their black navy. In which trust, all on; and no man seeks"
8428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To cross Polydamas’ advice with any other course,"
8429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Asius Hyrtacides, who (proud of his bay horse)"
8430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would not forsake them, nor his man, that was their manager,"
8431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Fool that he was) but all to fleet, and little knew how near"
8432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An ill death sat him, and a sure, and that he never more"
8433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must look on lofty Ilion; but looks, and all, before,"
8434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put on th’ all-cov’ring mist of fate, that then did hang upon"
8435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The lance of great Deucalides; he fatally rush’d on
8436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The left hand way, by which the Greeks, with horse and chariot,"
8437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Came usually from field to fleet; close to the gates he got,"
8438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which both unbarr’d and ope he found, that so the easier might"
8439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,An entry be for any friend that was behind in flight;
8440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet not much easier for a foe, because there was a guard"
8441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Maintain’d upon it, past his thought; who still put for it hard,"
8442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eagerly shouting; and with him were five more friends of name,"
8443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That would not leave him, though none else would hunt that way for fame"
8444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(In their free choice) but he himself. Orestes, Iamenus,"
8445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Acamas Asiades, Thoon, Oenomaus,"
8446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were those that follow’d Asius. Within the gates they found
8447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two eminently valorous, that from the race renown’d"
8448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of the right valiant Lapithes deriv’d their high descent;
8449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fierce Leontëus was the one, like Mars in detriment.[1]"
8450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The other mighty Polypæt, the great Pirithous’ son."
8451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These stood within the lofty gates, and nothing more did shun"
8452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The charge of Asius and his friends, than two high hill-bred oaks,"
8453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Well-rooted in the binding earth, obey the airy strokes"
8454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of wind and weather, standing firm ’gainst ev’ry season’s spite."
8455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet they pour on continued shouts, and bear their shields upright;"
8456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When in the mean space Polypæt and Leonteus cheer’d
8457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their soldiers to the fleet’s defence. But when the rest had heard
8458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans in attempt to scale, clamour and flight did flow"
8459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the Grecians; and then, the rest dismay’d, these two"
8460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Met Asius ent’ring, thrust him back, and fought before their doors."
8461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor far’d they then like oaks that stood, but as a brace of boars,"
8462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Couch’d in their own bred hill, that hear a sort of hunter’s shout,"
8463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And hounds in hot trail coming on, then from their dens break out,"
8464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Traverse their force, and suffer not, in wildness of their way,"
8465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About them any plant to stand, but thickets off’ring stay"
8466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Break through, and rend up by the roots, whet gnashes into air,"
8467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which Tumult fills with shouts, hounds, horns, and all the hot affair"
8468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beats at their bosoms; so their arms rung with assailing blows,"
8469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so they stirr’d them in repulse, right well assur’d that those"
8470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who were within, and on the wall, would add their parts, who knew"
8471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They now fought for their tents, fleet, lives, and fame, and therefore"
8472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,threw
8473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stones from the walls and tow’rs, as thick as when a drift wind shakes"
8474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Black clouds in pieces, and plucks snow, in great and plumy flakes,"
8475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From their soft bosoms, till the ground be wholly cloth’d in white;"
8476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So earth was hid with stones and darts, darts from the Trojan fight,"
8477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stones from the Greeks, that on the helms and bossy Trojan shields"
8478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kept such a rapping, it amaz’d great Asius, who now yields"
8479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sighs, beats his thighs, and in a rage his fault to Jove applies:"
8480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Jove,” said he, “now clear thou show’st thou art a friend to lies,"
8481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pretending, in the flight of Greece, the making of it good,"
8482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all their ruins, which I thought could never be withstood;"
8483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet they, as yellow wasps, or bees (that having made their nest[2]"
8484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The grasping cranny of a hill) when for a hunter’s feast
8485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hunters come hot and hungry in, and dig for honey-combs,"
8486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then fly upon them, strike and sting, and from their hollow homes"
8487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will not be beaten, but defend their labour’s fruit, and brood;"
8488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No more will these be from their port, but either lose their blood"
8489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Although but two against all us) or be our pris’ners made.”
8490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All this, to do his action grace, could not firm Jove persuade,"
8491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who for the gen’ral counsel stood, and ’gainst his singular brave,"
8492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bestow’d on Hector that day’s fame. Yet he and these behave
8493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Themselves thus nobly at this port; but how at other ports,"
8494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all alongst the stony wall, sole force, ’gainst force and forts,"
8495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rag’d in contention ’twixt both hosts, it were no easy thing,"
8496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had I the bosom of a God, to tune to life and sing."
8497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans fought not of themselves, a fire from heav’n was thrown"
8498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That ran amongst them, through the wall, mere added to their own."
8499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks held not their own; weak Grief went with her wither’d hand,"
8500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And dipp’d it deeply in their spirits, since they could not command"
8501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their forces to abide the field, whom harsh Necessity,"
8502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To save those ships should bring them home, and their good fort’s"
8503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"supply,"
8504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Drave to th’ expulsive fight they made; and this might stoop them more
8505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than Need itself could elevate, for ev’n Gods did deplore"
8506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their dire estates, and all the Gods that were their aids in war,"
8507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, though they could not clear their plights, yet were their friends"
8508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"thus far,"
8509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Still to uphold the better sort; for then did Polypæt pass
8510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A lance at Damasus, whose helm was made with cheeks of brass,"
8511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet had not proof enough, the pile drave through it and his skull."
8512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His brain in blood drown’d, and the man, so late so spiritfull,"
8513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fell now quite spiritless to earth. So emptied he the veins
8514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Pylon, and Ormenus’ lives. And then Leonteüs gains"
8515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The life’s end of Hippomachus, Antimachus’s son;"
8516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His lance fell at his girdle-stead, and with his end begun"
8517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Another end. Leonteüs left him, and through the prease"
8518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(His keen sword drawn) ran desp’rately upon Antiphates,"
8519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And lifeless tumbled him to earth. Nor could all these lives quench
8520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fi’ry spirit, that his flame in Menon’s blood did drench,"
8521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And rag’d up ev’n to Iamen’s, and young Orestes’ life;"
8522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All heap’d together made their peace in that red field of strife.
8523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose fair arms while the victors spoil’d, the youth of Ilion"
8524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Of which there serv’d the most and best) still boldly built upon
8525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wisdom of Polydamas, and Hector’s matchless strength,"
8526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And follow’d, fill’d with wondrous spirit, with wish and hope at length,"
8527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks’ wall won, to fire their fleet. But, having pass’d the dike,"
8528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And willing now to pass the wall, this prodigy did strike"
8529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their hearts with some delib’rate stay: A high-flown eagle soar’d
8530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On their troops’ left hand, and sustain’d a dragon, all engor’d,"
8531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In her strong seres, of wondrous size, and yet had no such check"
8532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In life and spirit but still she fought, and turning back her neck"
8533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So stung the eagle’s gorge, that down she cast her fervent prey"
8534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the multitude, and took upon the winds her way,"
8535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Crying with anguish. When they saw a branded serpent sprawl
8536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So full amongst them from above, and from Jove’s fowl let fall,"
8537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They took it an ostent from him, stood frighted, and their cause"
8538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Polydamas thought just, and spake: “Hector, you know, applause"
8539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of humour hath been far from me; nor fits it, or in war,"
8540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or in affairs of court, a man employ’d in public care"
8541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To blanch things further than their truth, or flatter any pow’r;"
8542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore for that simple course your strength has oft been sour
8543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To me in councils; yet again, what shows in my thoughts best,"
8544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I must discover. Let us cease, and make their flight our rest"
8545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For this day’s honour, and not now attempt the Grecian fleet,"
8546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For this, I fear, will be th’ event, the prodigy doth meet"
8547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So full with our affair in hand. As this high-flying fowl
8548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon the left wing of our host, implying our control,"
8549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hover’d above us, and did truss within her golden seres"
8550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A serpent so embru’d and big, which yet, in all her fears,"
8551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kept life and fervent spirit to fight, and wrought her own release,"
8552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor did the eagle’s eyry feed; so though we thus far prease
8553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon the Grecians, and perhaps may overrun their wall,"
8554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our high minds aiming at their fleet, and that we much appall"
8555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their trusséd spirits; yet are they so serpent-like dispos’d
8556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That they will fight, though in our seres, and will at length be los’d"
8557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all our outcries, and the life of many a Trojan breast"
8558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall with the eagle fly, before we carry to our nest"
8559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Them, or their navy.” Thus expounds the augur this ostent,"
8560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose depth he knows, and these should fear. Hector, with count’nance"
8561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"bent,"
8562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus answer’d him: “Polydamas, your depth in augury"
8563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I like not, and know passing well thou dost not satisfy"
8564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thyself in this opinion; or if thou think’st it true,"
8565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy thoughts the Gods blind, to advise, and urge that as our due,"
8566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That breaks our duties, and to Jove, whose vow and sign to me"
8567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is pass’d directly for our speed; yet light-wing’d birds must be,"
8568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By thy advice, our oracles, whose feathers little stay"
8569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My serious actions. What care I, if this, or th’ other, way"
8570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their wild wings sway them; if the right, on which the sun doth rise,"
8571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or, to the left hand, where he sets? ’Tis Jove’s high counsel flys"
8572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With those wings that shall bear up us; Jove’s, that both earth and"
8573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"heav’n,"
8574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both men and Gods, sustains and rules. One augury is giv’n"
8575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To order all men, best of all; Fight for thy country’s right."
8576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But why fear’st thou our further charge? For though the dang’rous fight
8577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strew all men here about the fleet, yet thou need’st never fear"
8578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To bear their fates; thy wary heart will never trust thee where
8579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An enemy’s look is; and yet fight, for, if thou dar’st abstain,"
8580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or whisper into any ear an abstinence so vain
8581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As thou advisest, never fear that any foe shall take"
8582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy life from thee, for ’tis this lance.” This said, all forwards make,"
8583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself the first; yet before him exulting Clamour flew,"
8584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thunder-loving Jupiter from lofty Ida blew
8585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A storm that usher’d their assault, and made them charge like him."
8586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It drave directly on the fleet a dust so fierce and dim
8587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That it amaz’d the Grecians, but was a grace divine"
8588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Hector and his following troops, who wholly did incline"
8589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To him, being now in grace with Jove, and so put boldly on"
8590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To raze the rampire; in whose height they fiercely set upon
8591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The parapets, and pull’d them down, raz’d ev’ry foremost fight,"
8592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the buttresses of stone, that held their tow’rs upright,"
8593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They tore away with crows of iron, and hop’d to ruin all."
8594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks yet stood, and still repair’d the fore-fights of their wall"
8595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With hides of oxen, and from thence, they pour’d down stones in show’rs"
8596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon the underminer’s heads. Within the foremost tow’rs
8597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both the Ajaces had command, who answer’d ev’ry part,"
8598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ assaulters, and their soldiers, repress’d, and put in heart;"
8599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Repairing valour as their wall; spake some fair, some reprov’d,"
8600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whoever made not good his place; and thus they all sorts mov’d:
8601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O countrymen, now need in aid would have excess be spent,"
8602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The excellent must be admir’d, the meanest excellent,"
8603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The worst do well. In changing war all should not be alike,"
8604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor any idle; which to know fits all, lest Hector strike"
8605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your minds with frights, as ears with threats. Forward be all your"
8606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"hands,"
8607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Urge one another. This doubt down, that now betwixt us stands,"
8608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Jove will go with us to their walls.” To this effect aloud
8609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Spake both the princes; and as high, with this, th’ expulsion flow’d."
8610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as in winter time, when Jove his cold sharp jav’lins throws"
8611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst us mortals, and is moved to white earth with his snows,"
8612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The winds asleep, he freely pours, till highest prominents,"
8613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hill tops, low meadows, and the fields that crown with most contents"
8614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The toils of men, seaports, and shores, are hid, and ev’ry place,"
8615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But floods, that snow’s fair tender flakes, as their own brood,"
8616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,embrace;
8617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So both sides cover’d earth with stones, so both for life contend,"
8618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To show their sharpness; through the wall uproar stood up an end.
8619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor had great Hector and his friends the rampire overrun,"
8620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If heav’n’s great Counsellor, high Jove, had not inflam’d his son"
8621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sarpedon (like the forest’s king when he on oxen flies)
8622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the Grecians; his round targe he to his arm applies,"
8623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brass-leav’d without, and all within thick ox-hides quilted hard,"
8624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The verge nail’d round with rods of gold; and, with two darts prepar’d,"
8625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He leads his people. As ye see a mountain-lion fare,"
8626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Long kept from prey, in forcing which, his high mind makes him dare"
8627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Assault upon the whole full fold, though guarded never so"
8628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With well-arm’d men, and eager dogs; away he will not go,"
8629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But venture on, and either snatch a prey, or be a prey;"
8630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So far’d divine Sarpedon’s mind, resolv’d to force his way"
8631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through all the fore-fights, and the wall; yet since he did not see"
8632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Others as great as he in name, as great in mind as he,"
8633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He spake to Glaucus:[3] “Glaucus, say, why are we honour’d more"
8634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than other men of Lycia, in place; with greater store"
8635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of meats and cups; with goodlier roofs; delightsome gardens; walks;
8636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More lands and better; so much wealth, that court and country talks"
8637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of us and our possessions, and ev’ry way we go,"
8638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Gaze on us as we were their Gods? This where we dwell is so;
8639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The shores of Xanthus ring of this; and shall we not exceed
8640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As much in merit as in noise? Come, be we great in deed"
8641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As well as look; shine not in gold, but in the flames of fight;"
8642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That so our neat-arm’d Lycians may say: ‘See, these are right"
8643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our kings, our rulers; these deserve to eat and drink the best;"
8644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These govern not ingloriously; these, thus exceed the rest,"
8645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Do more than they command to do.’ O friend, if keeping back"
8646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would keep back age from us, and death, and that we might not wrack"
8647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this life’s human sea at all, but that deferring now"
8648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We shunn’d death ever, nor would I half this vain valour show,"
8649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor glorify a folly so, to wish thee to advance;"
8650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But since we must go, though not here, and that, besides the chance"
8651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Propos’d now, there are infinite fates of other sort in death,"
8652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, neither to be fled nor ’scaped, a man must sink beneath,"
8653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come, try we, if this sort be ours, and either render thus"
8654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Glory to others, or make them resign the like to us.”"
8655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This motion Glaucus shifted not, but without words obey’d."
8656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Foreright went both, a mighty troop of Lycians followéd."
8657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which by Menestheus observ’d, his hair stood up on end,"
8658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, at the tow’r where he had charge, he saw Calamity bend"
8659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her horrid brows in their approach. He threw his looks about
8660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The whole fights near, to see what chief might help the mis’ry out"
8661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his poor soldiers, and beheld where both th’ Ajaces fought,"
8662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Teucer newly come from fleet; whom it would profit nought
8663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To call, since tumult on their helms, shields, and upon the ports,"
8664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laid such loud claps; for ev’ry way, defences of all sorts"
8665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were adding, as Troy took away; and Clamour flew so high"
8666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her wings strook heav’n, and drown’d all voice. The two dukes yet so"
8667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,nigh
8668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And at the offer of assault, he to th’ Ajaces sent"
8669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thoos the herald with this charge: “Run to the regiment
8670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of both th’ Ajaces, and call both, for both were better here,"
8671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since here will slaughter, instantly, be more enforc’d than there."
8672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Lycian captains this way make, who in the fights of stand"
8673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Have often show’d much excellence. Yet if laborious hand
8674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be there more needful than I hope, at least afford us some,"
8675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Let Ajax Telamonius and th’ archer Teucer come.”
8676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The herald hasted, and arriv’d; and both th’ Ajaces told,"
8677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That Peteus’ noble son desir’d their little labour would
8678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Employ himself in succouring him. Both their supplies were best,"
8679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since death assail’d his quarter most; for on it fiercely press’d
8680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The well-prov’d mighty Lycian chiefs. Yet if the service there
8681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Allow’d not both, he pray’d that one part of his charge would bear,"
8682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that was Ajax Telamon, with whom he wish’d would come"
8683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The archer Teucer. Telamon left instantly his room
8684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To strong Lycomedes, and will’d Ajax Oiliades"
8685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With him to make up his supply, and fill with courages"
8686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Grecian hearts till his return; which should he instantly
8687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When he had well reliev’d his friend. With this the company
8688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Teucer he took to his aid; Teucer, that did descend"
8689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(As Ajax did) from Telamon. With these two did attend
8690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pandion, that bore Teucer’s bow. When to Menestheus’ tow’r"
8691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They came, alongst the wall, they found him, and his hearten’d pow’r,"
8692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Toiling in making strong their fort. The Lycian princes set
8693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Black whirlwind-like, with both their pow’rs, upon the parapet."
8694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ajax, and all, resisted them. Clamour amongst them rose."
8695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The slaughter Ajax led; who first the last dear sight did close
8696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of strong Epicles, that was friend to Jove’s great Lycian son."
8697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the high munition heap, a mighty marble stone"
8698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lay highest, near the pinnacle, a stone of such a paise"
8699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That one of this time’s strongest men with both hands could not raise,"
8700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet this did Ajax rouse and throw, and all in sherds did drive"
8701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Epicles’ four-topp’d casque and skull; who (as ye see one dive
8702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In some deep river) left his height; life left his bones withal.
8703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Teucer shot Glaucus, rushing up yet higher on the wall,"
8704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where naked he discern’d his arm, and made him steal retreat"
8705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From that hot service, lest some Greek, with an insulting threat,"
8706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beholding it, might fright the rest. Sarpedon much was griev’d"
8707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At Glaucus parting, yet fought on, and his great heart reliev’d"
8708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A little with Alcmaon’s blood, surnam’d Thestorides,"
8709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose life he hurl’d out with his lance; which following through the
8710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,prease

8712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His fair arms ringing out his death. Then fierce Sarpedon took

8714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wall stripp’d naked, and broad way for entry and full fight"

8717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Jupiter averted death, who would not see his son"
8718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Die at the tails of th’ Achive ships. Ajax did fetch his run,"
8719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, with his lance, strook through the targe of that brave Lycian"

8721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet kept he it from further pass, nor did it anything"
8722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dismay his mind, although his men stood off from that high way"
8723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His valour made them, which he kept, and hop’d that stormy day"
8724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should ever make his glory clear. His men’s fault thus he blam’d:
8725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Lycians, why are your hot spirits so quickly disinflam’d?"
8726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Suppose me ablest of you all, ’tis hard for me alone"
8727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To ruin such a wall as this, and make confusion"
8728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Way to their navy. Lend your hands. What many can dispatch,"
8729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,One cannot think. The noble work of many hath no match.”
8730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The wise king’s just rebuke did strike a rev’rence to his will
8731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through all his soldiers; all stood in, and ’gainst all th’ Achives"
8732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,still
8733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made strong their squadrons, insomuch, that to the adverse side,"
8734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The work show’d mighty, and the wall, when ’twas within descried,"
8735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No easy service; yet the Greeks could neither free their wall
8736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of these brave Lycians, that held firm the place they first did scale;"
8737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor could the Lycians from their fort the sturdy Grecians drive,"
8738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor reach their fleet. But as two men about the limits strive
8739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of land that toucheth in a field, their measures in their hands,"
8740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They mete their parts out curiously, and either stiffly stands"
8741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That so far is his right in law, both hugely set on fire"
8742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About a passing-little ground; so, greedily aspire"
8743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both these foes to their sev’ral ends, and all exhaust their most"
8744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About the very battlements (for yet no more was lost ).[4]
8745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With sword and fire they vex’d for them their targes hugely round,"
8746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With ox-hides lin’d, and bucklers light; and many a ghastly wound"
8747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The stern steel gave for that one prise; whereof though some receiv’d
8748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their portions on their naked backs, yet others were bereav’d"
8749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of brave lives, face-turn’d, through their shields; tow’rs, bulwarks,"
8750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,ev’rywhere
8751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were freckled with the blood of men. Nor yet the Greeks did bear
8752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Base back-turn’d faces; nor their foes would therefore be out-fac’d.
8753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But as a spinster poor and just, ye sometimes see, straight-lac’d"
8754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the weighing of her web, who, careful, having charge"
8755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For which she would provide some means, is loth to be too large"
8756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In giving or in taking weight, but ever with her hand"
8757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is doing with the weights and wool, till both in just paise stand;[5]"
8758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So ev’nly stood it with these foes, till Jove to Hector gave"
8759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The turning of the scales; who first against the rampire drave,"
8760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And spake so loud that all might hear: “O stand not at the pale,"
8761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brave Trojan friends, but mend your hands; up, and break through the"
8762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"wall,"
8763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And make a bonfire of their fleet.” All heard, and all in heaps"
8764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Got scaling-ladders, and aloft. In mean space, Hector leaps"
8765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon the port, from whose out-part he tore a massy stone,"
8766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thick downwards, upward edg’d; it was so huge an one"
8767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That two vast yeomen of most strength, such as these times beget,[6]"
8768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Could not from earth lift to a cart, yet he did brandish it"
8769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alone, Saturnius made it light; and swinging it as nought,"
8770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He came before the planky gates, that all for strength were wrought,"
8771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And kept the port; two-fold they were, and with two rafters barr’d,"
8772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"High, and strong-lock’d; he rais’d the stone, bent to the hurl so hard,"
8773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And made it with so main a strength, that all the gates did crack,"
8774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rafters left them, and the folds one from another brake,"
8775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hinges piecemeal flew, and through the fervent little rock"
8776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thunder’d a passage; with his weight th’ inwall his breast did knock,"
8777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in rush’d Hector, fierce and grim as any stormy night;"
8778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His brass arms round about his breast reflected terrible light;
8779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Each arm held-up held each a dart; his presence call’d up all
8780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The dreadful spirits his being held, that to the threaten’d wall"
8781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,None but the Gods might check his way; his eyes were furnaces;
8782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus he look’d back, call’d in all. All fir’d their courages,"
8783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in they flow’d. The Grecians fled, their fleet now and their"
8784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,freight
8785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ask’d all their rescue. Greece went down; Tumult was at his height.

9011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when the Greek ships, double-oar’d, arriv’d at Ilion,"
9012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Ilion he return’d, and prov’d beyond comparison"

9022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flew Hector, at his sounding fall, with full intent to win"
9023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The tempting helmet from his head; but Ajax with a dart
9024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Reach’d Hector at his rushing in, yet touch’d not any part"
9025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About his body; it was hid quite through with horrid brass;
9026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The boss yet of his targe it took, whose firm stuff stay’d the pass,"
9027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And he turn’d safe from both the trunks; both which the Grecians bore
9028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From off the field. Amphimachus Menestheus did restore,"
9029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Stichius, to th’ Achaian strength. Th’ Ajaces (that were pleas’d"
9030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Still most with most hot services) on Trojan Imbrius seiz’d.
9031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as from sharply-bitten hounds, a brace of lions force"
9032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A new-slain goat, and through the woods bear in their jaws the corse"
9033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aloft, lift up into the air; so, up into the skies,"
9034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bore both th’ Ajaces Imbrius, and made his arms their prise."
9035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, not content, Oïliades, enrag’d to see there dead"
9036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His much-belov’d Amphimachus, he hew’d off Imbrius’ head;"
9037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, swinging round, bowl-like he toss’d amongst the Trojan prease,"
9038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And full at Hector’s feet it fell. Amphimachus’ decease,"
9039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being nephew to the God of waves, much vex’d the Deity’s mind,"
9040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to the ships and tents he march’d, yet more to make inclin’d"
9041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Grecians to the Trojan bane. In hasting to which end,"
9042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Idomenëus met with him, returning from a friend,"
9043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose ham late hurt, his men brought off; and having giv’n command"
9044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his physicians for his cure, much fir’d to put his hand"
9045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Troy’s repulse, he left his tent. Him (like Andremon’s son,"
9046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prince Thoas, that in Pleuron rul’d, and lofty Calydon,"
9047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ Ætolian pow’rs, and like a God was of his subjects lov’d)"
9048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Neptune encounter’d, and but thus his forward spirit mov’d:"
9049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Idomenëus, prince of Crete! O whither now are fled"
9050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those threats in thee, with which the rest the Trojans menacéd?”"
9051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Thoas,” he replied, “no one of all our host stands now"
9052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In any question of reproof, as I am let to know,"
9053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And why is my intelligence false? We all know how to fight,"
9054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, (fear disanimating none) all do our knowledge right."
9055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor can our harms accuse our sloth, not one from work we miss."
9056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The great God only works our ill, whose pleasure now it is"
9057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, far from home, in hostile fields, and with inglorious fate,"
9058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some Greeks should perish. But do thou, O Thoas, that of late"
9059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hast prov’d a soldier, and was wont, where thou hast sloth beheld,"
9060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To chide it, and exhort to pains, now hate to be repell’d,"
9061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And set on all men.” He replied, “I would to heav’n, that he,"
9062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whoever this day doth abstain from battle willingly,"
9063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May never turn his face from Troy, but here become the prey"
9064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And scorn of dogs! Come then, take arms, and let our kind assay"
9065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Join both our forces. Though but two, yet, being both combin’d,"
9066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The work of many single hands we may perform. We find,"
9067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That virtue co-augmented thrives in men of little mind,"
9068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But we have singly match’d the great.” Thus said, the God again,"
9069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all his conflicts, visited the vent’rous flight of men."
9070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The king turn’d to his tent; rich arms put on his breast, and took"
9071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two darts in hand, and forth he flew. His haste on made him look"
9072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much like a fi’ry meteor, with which Jove’s sulph’ry hand"
9073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Opes heav’n, and hurls about the air bright flashes, showing aland"
9074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Abodes that ever run before tempest and plagues to men:
9075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So, in his swift pace, show’d his arms. He was encounter’d then"
9076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By his good friend Meriones yet near his tent; to whom
9077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus spake the pow’r of Idomen: “What reason makes thee come,"
9078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou son of Molus, my most lov’d, thus leaving fight alone?"
9079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is’t for some wound? The jav’lin’s head, still sticking in the bone,"
9080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Desir’st thou ease of? Bring’st thou news? Or what is it that brings
9081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy presence hither? Be assur’d, my spirit needs no stings"
9082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To this hot conflict. Of myself thou seest I come, and loth,"
9083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For any tent’s love, to deserve the hateful taint of sloth.”"
9084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: Only for a dart, he that retreat did make,"
9085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Were any left him at his tent) for, that he had, he brake"
9086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On proud Deiphobus’s shield. “Is one dart all?” said he,"
9087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Take one and twenty, if thou like, for in my tent they be;"
9088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They stand there shining by the walls. I took them as my prise
9089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From those false Trojans I have slain. And this is not the guise
9090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of one that loves his tent, or fights afar off with his foe,"
9091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But since I love fight, therefore doth my martial star bestow,"
9092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides those darts, helms, targets boss’d, and corslets bright as"
9093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,day.”
9094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“So I,” said Merion, “at my tent, and sable bark, may say,"
9095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I many Trojan spoils retain, but now not near they be,"
9096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To serve me for my present use; and therefore ask I thee.
9097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not that I lack a fortitude to store me with my own,"
9098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For ever in the foremost fights, that render men renown,"
9099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I fight, when any fight doth stir. And this perhaps may well"
9100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be hid to others, but thou know’st, and I to thee appeal.”"
9101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I know,” replied the king, “how much thou weigh’st in ev’ry worth,"
9102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What need’st thou therefore utter this? If we should now choose forth
9103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The worthiest men for ambushes, in all our fleet and host,"
9104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(For ambushes are services that try men’s virtues most,"
9105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since there the fearful and the firm will, as they are, appear,"
9106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fearful alt’ring still his hue, and rests not anywhere,"
9107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor is his spirit capable of th’ ambush constancy,"
9108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But riseth, changeth still his place, and croucheth curiously"
9109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his bent haunches; half his height scarce seen above the ground,"
9110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For fear to be seen, yet must see; his heart, with many a bound,"
9111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Off’ring to leap out of his breast, and, ever fearing death,"
9112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The coldness of it makes him gnash, and half shakes out his teeth;"
9113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where men of valour neither fear, nor ever change their looks,"
9114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From lodging th’ ambush till it rise, but, since there must be strokes,"
9115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wish to be quickly in their midst) thy strength and hand in these
9116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who should reprove? For if, far off, or fighting in the prease,"
9117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou shouldst be wounded, I am sure the dart that gave the wound"
9118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should not be drawn out of thy back, or make thy neck the ground,"
9119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But meet thy belly, or thy breast, in thrusting further yet"
9120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When thou art furthest, till the first, and before him, thou get."
9121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But on; like children let not us stand bragging thus, but do;"
9122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest some hear, and past measure chide, that we stand still and woo."
9123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go, choose a better dart, and make Mars yield a better chance.”"
9124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, Mars-swift Meriones, with haste, a brazen lance"
9125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took from his tent, and overtook, most careful of the wars,"
9126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Idomenëus, And such two, in field, as harmful Mars,"
9127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Terror, his belovéd son, that without terror fights,"
9128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And is of such strength that in war the frighter he affrights,"
9129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, out of Thrace, they both take arms against th’ Ephyran bands,"
9130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or ’gainst the great-soul’d Phlegians, nor favour their own hands,"
9131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But give the grace to others still; in such sort to the fight,"
9132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"March’d these two managers of men, in armours full of light."
9133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And first spake Merion: “On which part, son of Deucalion,"
9134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Serves thy mind to invade the fight? Is’t best to set upon
9135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans, in our battle’s aid, the right or left-hand wing,"
9136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For all parts I suppose employ’d?” To this the Cretan king
9137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus answer’d: “In our navy’s midst are others that assist;
9138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The two Ajaces; Teucer too, with shafts the expertest"
9139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Grecians, and, though small, is great in fights of stand;"
9140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And these (though huge he be of strength) will serve to fill the hand
9141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Hector’s self, that Priamist, that studier for blows."
9142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It shall be call’d a deed of height for him (even suff’ring throes
9143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For knocks still) to outlabour them, and, bett’ring their tough hands,"
9144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Enflame our fleet. If Jove himself cast not his fire-brands
9145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst our navy, that affair no man can bring to field."
9146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Great Ajax Telamonius to none alive will yield
9147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That yields to death, and whose life takes Ceres’ nutritions,"
9148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That can be cut with any iron, or pash’d with mighty stones;"
9149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not to Æacides himself he yields for combats set,"
9150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though clear he must give place for pace and free swing of his feet.
9151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since then, the battle (being our place of most care) is made good"
9152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By his high valour, let our aid see all pow’rs be withstood"
9153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That charge the left wing, and to that let us direct our course,"
9154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where quickly feel we this hot foe, or make him feel our force.”"
9155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This order’d, swift Meriones went, and forewent his king,"
9156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till both arriv’d where one enjoin’d. When, in the Greeks’ left wing,"
9157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans saw the Cretan king, like fire in fortitude,"
9158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And his attendant, in bright arms so gloriously indu’d,"
9159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both cheering the sinister troops, all at the king address’d,"
9160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so the skirmish at their sterns on both parts were increas’d,"
9161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, as from hollow bustling winds engender’d storms arise,"
9162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When dust doth chiefly clog the ways which up into the skies
9163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wanton tempest ravisheth, begetting night of day;"
9164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So came together both the foes, both lusted to assay,"
9165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And work with quick steel either’s death. Man’s fierce corruptress,"
9166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fight,"
9167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Set up her bristles in the field with lances long and light,"
9168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which thick fell foul on either’s face. The splendour of the steel,"
9169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In new-scour’d curets, radiant casques, and burnish’d shields, did seel"
9170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ assailer’s eyes up. He sustain’d a huge spirit, that was glad"
9171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see that labour, or in soul that stood not stricken sad."
9172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus these two disagreeing Gods, old Saturn’s mighty sons,"
9173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Afflicted these heroic men with huge oppressións.
9174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Jove honouring Æacides (to let the Greeks still try
9175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their want without him) would bestow, yet still, the victory"
9176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On Hector, and the Trojan pow’r; yet for Æacides,"
9177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And honour of his mother-queen, great Goddess of the seas,"
9178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He would not let proud Ilion see the Grecians quite destroy’d,"
9179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore from the hoary deep he suffered so employ’d
9180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Neptune in the Grecian aid; who griev’d for them, and storm’d"
9181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Extremely at his brother Jove. Yet both one Goddess form’d,"
9182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And one soil bred, but Jupiter precedence took in birth,"
9183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And had more knowledge; for which cause, the other came not forth[1]"
9184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his wet kingdom, but with care of not being seen t’ excite"
9185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Grecian host, and like a man appear’d, and made the fight."
9186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So these Gods made men’s valours great, but equall’d them with war"
9187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As harmful as their hearts were good; and stretch’d those chains as far
9188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On both sides as their limbs could bear, in which they were involv’d"
9189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past breach, or loosing, that their knees might therefore be dissolv’d."
9190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then, though a half-grey man he were, Crete’s sov’reign did excite"
9191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks to blows, and flew upon the Trojans, ev’n to flight;"
9192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For he, in sight of all the host, Othryonëus slew,"
9193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That from Cabesus, with the fame of those wars, thither drew"
9194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His new-come forces, and requir’d, without respect of dow’r,"
9195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cassandra, fair’st of Priam’s race; assuring with his pow’r"
9196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A mighty labour, to expell, in their despite, from Troy"
9197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sons of Greece. The king did vow, that done, he should enjoy"
9198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His goodliest daughter. He (in trust of that fair purchase) fought;
9199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And at him threw the Cretan king a lance, that singled out"
9200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This great assumer, whom it strook just in his navel-stead."
9201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His brazen curets helping nought, resign’d him to the dead."
9202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then did the conqueror exclaim, and thus insulted then:"
9203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Othryonëus, I will praise, beyond all mortal men,"
9204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy living virtues, if thou wilt now perfect the brave vow"
9205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou mad’st to Priam, for the wife he promis’d to bestow."
9206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And where he should have kept his word, there we assure thee here,"
9207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To give thee for thy princely wife the fairest and most dear
9208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of our great Gen’ral’s female race, which from his Argive hall"
9209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We all will wait upon to Troy, if, with our aids, and all,"
9210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou wilt but raze this well-built town. Come, therefore, follow me,"
9211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That in our ships we may conclude this royal match with thee.
9212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll be no jot worse than my word.” With that he took his feet,"
9213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And dragg’d him through the fervent fight; in which did Asius meet
9214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The victor, to inflict revenge. He came on foot before"
9215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His horse, that on his shoulders breath’d; so closely evermore"
9216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His coachman led them to his lord; who held a huge desire
9217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To strike the king, but he strook first, and underneath his chin,"
9218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At his throat’s height, through th’ other side, his eager lance drave"
9219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,in;
9220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And down he bustled like an oak, a poplar, or a pine,"
9221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hewn down for shipwood, and so lay. His fall did so decline"
9222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The spirit of his charioteer, that, lest he should incense"
9223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The victor to impair his spoil, he durst not drive from thence"
9224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His horse and chariot; and so pleas’d, with that respective part,"
9225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antilochus, that for his fear he reach’d him with a dart"
9226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About his belly’s midst, and down his sad corse fell beneath"
9227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The richly builded chariot, there labouring out his breath."
9228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The horse Antilochus took off; when, griev’d for this event,"
9229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deiphobus drew passing near, and at the victor sent"
9230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A shining jav’lin; which he saw, and shunn’d, with gath’ring round"
9231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His body in his all-round shield, at whose top, with a sound,"
9232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It overflew; yet, seizing there, it did not idly fly"
9233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"from him that wing’d it, his strong hand still drave it mortally"
9234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On Prince Hypsenor; it did pierce his liver, underneath"
9235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The veins it passeth; his shrunk knees submitted him to death.
9236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then did lov’d Deiphobus miraculously vaunt:
9237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Now Asius lies not unreveng’d, nor doth his spirit want"
9238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The joy I wish it, though it be now ent’ring the strong gate"
9239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of mighty Pluto, since this hand hath sent him down a mate.”"
9240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This glory in him griev’d the Greeks, and chiefly the great mind"
9241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of martial Antilochus, who though to grief inclin’d,"
9242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He left not yet his friend, but ran and hid him with his shield;"
9243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to him came two lovely friends, that freed him from the field,"
9244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mecisteus, son of Echius, and the right nobly born"
9245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alastor, bearing him to fleet, and did extremely mourn."
9246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Idomenëus sunk not yet, but held his nerves entire,"
9247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mind much less deficient, being fed with firm desire"
9248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To hide more Trojans in dim night, or sink himself in guard"
9249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his lov’d countrymen. And then Alcathous prepar’d
9250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Work for his valour, off’ring fate his own destructión."
9251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A great heroë, and had grace to be the lovéd son"
9252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Æsyetes, son-in-law to prince Æneas’ sire,"
9253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hippodamia marrying; who most enflam’d the fire
9254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of her dear parents’ love, and took precedence in her birth"
9255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all their daughters, and as much exceeded in her worth"
9256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(For beauty answer’d with her mind, and both with housewif’ry)"
9257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All the fair beauty of young dames that us’d her company,"
9258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore, being the worthiest dame, the worthiest man did wed"
9259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of ample Troy. Him Neptune stoop’d beneath the royal force
9260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Idomen, his sparkling eyes deluding, and the course"
9261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his illustrious lineaments so out of nature bound,"
9262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That back nor forward he could stir, but, as he grew to ground,"
9263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood like a pillar, or high tree, and neither mov’d, nor fear’d;"
9264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When straight the royal Cretan’s dart in his mid breast appear’d,"
9265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It brake the curets, that were proof to ev’ry other dart,"
9266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet now they cleft and rung; the lance stuck shaking in his heart;
9267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His heart with panting made it shake; but Mars did now remit
9268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The greatness of it, and the king, now quitting the brag fit"
9269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of glory in Deiphobus, thus terribly exclaim’d:"
9270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Deiphobus, now may we think that we are ev’nly fam’d,"
9271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That three for one have sent to Dis. But come, change blows with me,"
9272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy vaunts for him thou slew’st were vain. Come, wretch, that thou"
9273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,may’st see
9274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What issue Jove hath. Jove begot Minos, the strength of Crete;"
9275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Minos begot Deucalion; Deucalion did beget
9276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Me Idomen, now Creta’s king, that here my ships have brought"
9277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To bring thyself, thy father, friends, all Ilion’s pomp, to nought.”"
9278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deiphobus at two ways stood, in doubt to call some one,"
9279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With some retreat, to be his aid, or try the chance alone."
9280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At last, the first seem’d best to him, and back he went to call"
9281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Anchises’ son to friend, who stood in troop the last of all,"
9282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where still he serv’d; which made him still incense against the king,"
9283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, being amongst his best their peer, he grac’d not anything"
9284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wrong’d deserts. Deiphobus spake to him, standing near:"
9285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Æneas, prince of Troians, if any touch appear"
9286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of glory in thee, thou must now assist thy sister’s lord,"
9287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And one that to thy tend’rest youth did careful guard afford,"
9288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alcathous, whom Creta’s king hath chiefly slain to thee,"
9289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His right most challenging thy band. Come, therefore, follow me.”"
9290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This much excited his good mind, and set his heart on fire"
9291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the Cretan, who child-like dissolv’d not in his ire,"
9292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But stood him firm. As when in hills a strength relying boar,"
9293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alone, and hearing hunters come, whom tumult flies before,"
9294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up-thrusts his bristles, whets his tusks, sets fire on his red eyes,"
9295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And in his brave prepar’d repulse doth dogs and men despise;
9296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So stood the famous-for-his-lance, nor shunn’d the coming charge"
9297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That resolute Æneas brought. Yet, since the odds was large,"
9298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He call’d with good right to his aid war-skill’d Ascalaphus,"
9299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aphareüs, Meriones, the strong Deipyrus,"
9300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Nestor’s honourable son: “Come near, my friends,” said he,"
9301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“And add your aids to me alone. Fear taints me worthily,"
9302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though firm I stand, and show it not. Æneas great in fight,"
9303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And one that bears youth in his flow’r, that bears the greatest might,"
9304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Comes on with aim direct at me. Had I his youthful limb
9305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To bear my mind, he should yield fame, or I would yield it him.”"
9306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, all held, in many souls, one ready helpful mind,"
9307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Clapp’d shields and shoulders, and stood close.  Æneas, not inclin’d"
9308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With more presumption than the king, call’d aid as well as he,"
9309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Agenor, Helen’s love, who follow’d instantly,"
9310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all their forces following them; as after bellwethers
9311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The whole flocks follow to their drink, which sight the shepherd"
9312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,cheers.
9313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor was Æneas’ joy less mov’d to see such troops attend
9314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His honour’d person; and all these fought close about his friend;
9315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But two of them, past all the rest, had strong desire to shed"
9316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The blood of either; Idomen, and Cytherea’s seed."
9317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Æneas first bestow’d his lance, which th’ other seeing shunn’d,"
9318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that, thrown from an idle hand, stuck trembling in the ground."
9319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Idomen’s, discharg’d at him, had no such vain success,"
9320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which Œnomaus’ entrails found, in which it did impress"
9321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His sharp pile to his fall; his palms tore his returning earth.
9322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Idomenëus straight stepp’d in, and pluck’d his jav’lin forth,"
9323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But could not spoil his goodly arms, they press’d him so with darts."
9324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now the long toil of the fight had spent his vig’rous parts,"
9325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And made them less apt to avoid the foe that should advance,"
9326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or, when himself advanc’d again, to run and fetch his lance,"
9327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore in stiff fights of stand he spent the cruel day.
9328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, coming softly from the slain, Deiphobus gave way"
9329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his bright jav’lin at the king, whom he could never brook;"
9330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But then he lost his envy too. His lance yet deadly took
9331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ascalaphus, the son of Mars; quite through his shoulder flew"
9332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The violent head, and down he fell. Nor yet by all means knew"
9333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wide-throated Mars his son was fall’n, but in Olympus’ top"
9334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sat canopied with golden clouds; Jove’s counsel had shut up
9335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both him and all the other Gods from that time’s equal task,"
9336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which now, about Ascalaphus, strife set. His shining casque"
9337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deiphobus had forc’d from him, but instantly leap’d in"
9338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mars-swift Meriones, and strook, with his long javelin,"
9339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The right arm of Deiphobus, which made his hand let fall"
9340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sharp-topp’d helmet; the press’d earth resounding there withal.
9341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, vulture-like, Meriones rush’d in again and drew,"
9342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From out the low part of his arm his jav’lin, and then flew"
9343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Back to his friends. Deiphobus, faint with the blood’s excess"
9344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fall’n from his wound, was carefully convey’d out of the press"
9345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By his kind brother by both sides, Polites, till they gat"
9346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His horse and chariot that were still set fit for his retreat,"
9347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bore him now to Ilion. The rest fought fiercely on,"
9348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And set a mighty fight on foot. When next, Anchises’ son"
9349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aphareus Caletorides, that ran upon him, strook"
9350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Just in the throat with his keen lance; and straight his head forsook
9351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His upright carriage; and his shield, his helm, and all, with him"
9352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fell to the earth; where ruinous death made prise of ev’ry limb.
9353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antilochus, discov’ring well that Thoon’s heart took check,"
9354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let fly, and cut the hollow vein, that runs up to his neck,"
9355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Along his back part, quite in twain; down in the dust he fell,"
9356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upwards, and, with extended hands, bade all the world farewell."
9357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antilochus rush’d nimbly in, and, looking round, made prise"
9358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his fair arms; in which affair his round-set enemies
9359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let fly their lances, thundering on his advanced targe,"
9360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But could not get his flesh. The God that shakes the earth took charge
9361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Nestor’s son and kept him safe; who never was away,"
9362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But still amongst the thickest foes his busy lance did play,"
9363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Observing ever when he might, far off, or near, offend;"
9364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And watching Asius’ son, in prease he spied him, and did send,"
9365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close coming on, a dart at him, that smote in midst his shield,"
9366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which the sharp head of the lance the blue-hair’d God made yield,"
9367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not pleas’d to yield his pupil’s life; in whose shield half the dart
9368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Stuck like a truncheon burn’d with fire; on earth lay th’ other part.
9369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, seeing no better end of all, retir’d in fear of worse"
9370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But him Meriones pursu’d; and his lance found full course
9371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To th’ other’s life. It wounded him betwixt the privy parts
9372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And navel, where, to wretched men that war’s most violent smarts"
9373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must undergo, wounds chiefly vex. His dart Meriones"
9374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pursu’d, and Adamas so striv’d with it, and his misease,"
9375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As doth a bullock puff and storm, whom in disdainéd bands"
9376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The upland herdsmen strive to cast; so, fall’n beneath the hands"
9377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his stern foe, Asiades did struggle, pant, and rave."
9378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But no long time; for when the lance was pluck’d out, up he gave"
9379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His tortur’d soul. Then Troy’s turn came; when with a Thracian sword
9380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The temples of Deipyrus did Helenus afford
9381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So huge a blow, it strook all light out of his cloudy eyes,"
9382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And cleft his helmet; which a Greek, there fighting, made his prise,"
9383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It fell so full beneath his feet. Atrides griev’d to see
9384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That sight, and, threat’ning, shook a lance at Helenus, and he"
9385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A bow half drew at him; at once out flew both shaft and lance.
9386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The shaft Atrides’ curets strook; and far away did glance.
9387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Atrides’ dart of Helenus the thrust out bow-hand strook,"
9388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, through the hand, stuck in the bow. Agenor’s hand did pluck"
9389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From forth the nailéd prisoner the jav’lin quickly out;
9390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And fairly, with a little wool, enwrapping round about"
9391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wounded hand, within a scarf he bore it, which his squire"
9392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had ready for him. Yet the wound would needs he should retire.
9393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pisander, to revenge his hurt, right on the king ran he."
9394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A bloody fate suggested him to let him run on thee,"
9395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O Menelaus, that he might, by thee, in dang’rous war"
9396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be done to death. Both coming on, Atrides’ lance did err."
9397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pisander strook Atrides’ shield, that brake at point the dart"
9398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not running through; yet he rejoic’d as playing a victor’s part.
9399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Atrides, drawing his fair sword, upon Pisander flew;"
9400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pisander, from beneath his shield, his goodly weapon drew,"
9401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two-edg’d, with right sharp steel, and long, the handle olive-tree,"
9402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Well-polish’d; and to blows they go. Upon the top strook he
9403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Atrides’ horse-hair’d-feather’d helm; Atrides on his brow,"
9404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Above th’ extreme part of his nose, laid such a heavy blow"
9405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That all the bones crash’d under it, and out his eyes did drop"
9406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before his feet in bloody dust; he after, and shrunk up"
9407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His dying body, which the foot of his triumphing foe"
9408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Open’d, and stood upon his breast, and off his arms did go,"
9409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This insultation us’d the while: “At length forsake our fleet,"
9410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus ye false Trojans, to whom war never enough is sweet."
9411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor want ye more impieties, with which ye have abus’d"
9412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Me, ye bold dogs, that your chief friends so honourably us’d."
9413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor fear you hospitable Jove, that lets such thunders go."
9414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But build upon’t, he will unbuild your tow’rs that clamber so,"
9415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For ravishing my goods, and wife, in flow’r of all her years,"
9416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And without cause; nay, when that fair and lib’ral hand of hers"
9417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had us’d you so most lovingly. And now again ye would
9418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cast fire into our fleet, and kill our princes if ye could."
9419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go to, one day you will be curb’d, though never so ye thirst"
9420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rude war, by war. O father Jove, they say thou art the first"
9421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In wisdom of all Gods and men, yet all this comes from thee,"
9422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And still thou gratifiest these men, how lewd so e’er they be,"
9423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though never they be cloy’d with sins, nor can be satiate,"
9424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As good men should, with this vile war. Satiety of state,"
9425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Satiety of sleep and love, satiety of ease,"
9426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of music, dancing, can find place; yet harsh war still must please"
9427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past all these pleasures, ev’n past these. They will be cloy’d with"
9428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,these
9429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before their war joys. Never war gives Troy satieties.”
9430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, the bloody arms were oft; and to his soldiers thrown,"
9431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He mixing in first fight again. And then Harpalion,"
9432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kind king Pylæmen’s son, gave charge; who to those wars of Troy"
9433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His lovéd father followéd, nor ever did enjoy"
9434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His country’s sight again. He strook the targe of Atreus’ son
9435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Full in the midst; his jav’lin’s steel yet had no pow’r to run
9436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The target through; nor had himself the heart to fetch his lance,"
9437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But took him to his strength, and cast on ev’ry side a glance,"
9438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest any his dear sides should dart. But Merion, as he fled,"
9439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sent after him a brazen lance, that ran his eager head"
9440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through his right hip, and all along the bladder’s región"
9441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath the bone; it settled him, and set his spirit gone"
9442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst the hands of his best friends; and like a worm he lay
9443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stretch’d on the earth, which his black blood imbru’d, and flow’d away."
9444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His corse the Paphlagonians did sadly wait upon,"
9445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Repos’d in his rich chariot, to sacred Ilion;"
9446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The king his father following, dissolv’d in kindly tears,"
9447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And no wreak sought for his slain son. But, at his slaughterers"
9448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Incenséd Paris spent a lance, since he had been a guest"
9449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To many Paphlagonians; and through the prease it press’d.
9450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There was a certain augur’s son, that did for wealth excell,"
9451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet was honest; he was born, and did at Corinth dwell;"
9452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, though he knew his harmful fate, would needs his ship ascend."
9453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His father, Polyidus, oft would tell him that his end"
9454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would either seize him at his house, upon a sharp disease,"
9455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or else among the Grecian ships by Trojans slain. Both these
9456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Together he desir’d to shun; but the disease, at last,"
9457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ling’ring death in it, he left, and war’s quick stroke embrac’d."
9458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The lance betwixt his ear and cheek ran in, and drave the mind"
9459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of both those bitter fortunes out. Night strook his whole pow’rs blind.
9460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus fought they, like the spirit of fire; nor Jove-lov’d Hector knew"
9461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,How in the fleet’s left wing the Greeks his down-put soldiers slew
9462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Almost to victory; the God that shakes the earth so well
9463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Help’d with his own strength, and the Greeks so fiercely did impel."
9464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet Hector made the first place good, where both the ports and wall"
9465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(The thick rank of the Greek shields broke) he enter’d, and did skall,"
9466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where on the gray sea’s shore were drawn (the wall being there but
9467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,slight)
9468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Protesilaus’ ships, and those of Ajax, where the fight"
9469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of men and horse were sharpest set. There the Bœotian bands,"
9470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Long-rob’d Iaons, Locrians, and, brave men of their hands,"
9471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Phthian and Epeian troops did spritefully assail
9472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The god-like Hector rushing in; and yet could not prevail
9473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his repulse, though choicest men of Athens there made head;"
9474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst whom was Menestheus chief, whom Phidias followéd,"
9475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stichius and Bias, huge in strength. Th’ Epeian troops were led"
9476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Meges’ and Phylides’ cares, Amphion, Dracius."
9477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before the Phthians Medon march’d, and Meneptolemus;"
9478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And these, with the Bœotian pow’rs, bore up the fleet’s defence."
9479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Oïleus by his brother’s side stood close, and would not thence"
9480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For any moment of that time. But, as through fallow fields"
9481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Black oxen draw a well-join’d plough, and either ev’nly yields"
9482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His thrifty labour, all heads couch’d so close to earth they plow"
9483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fallow with their horns, till out the sweat begins to flow,"
9484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The stretch’d yokes crack, and yet at last the furrow forth is driven;"
9485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So toughly stood these to their task, and made their work as even."
9486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But Ajax Telamonius had many helpful men
9487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, when sweat ran about his knees, and labour flow’d, would then"
9488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Help bear his mighty sev’n-fold shield; when swift Oïliades
9489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Locrians left, and would not make those murth’rous fights of"
9490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"prease,"
9491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Because they wore no bright steel casques, nor bristled plumes for"
9492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"show,"
9493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Round shields, nor darts of solid ash, but with the trusty bow,"
9494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And jacks well-quilted with soft wool, they came to Troy, and were,"
9495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In their fit place, as confident as those that fought so near,"
9496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And reach’d their foes so thick with shafts, that these were they that"
9497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,brake
9498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojan orders first; and then, the brave arm’d men did make"
9499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good work with their close fights before. Behind whom, having shot,"
9500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Locrians hid still; and their foes all thought of fight forgot
9501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With shows of those far-striking shafts, their eyes were troubled so."
9502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then, assur’dly, from the ships, and tents, th’ insulting foe"
9503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had miserably fled to Troy, had not Polydamas"
9504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus spake to Hector: “Hector, still impossible ’tis to pass"
9505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good counsel upon you. But say some God prefers thy deeds,"
9506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In counsels wouldst thou pass us too? In all things none exceeds.
9507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To some God gives the pow’r of war, to some the sleight to dance,"
9508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To some the art of instruments, some doth for voice advance;"
9509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that far-seeing God grants some the wisdom of the mind,"
9510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which no man can keep to himself, that, though but few can find,"
9511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Doth profit many, that preserves the public weal and state,"
9512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that, who hath, he best can prize. But, for me, I’ll relate"
9513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Only my censure what’s our best. The very crown of war
9514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Doth burn about thee; yet our men, when they have reach’d thus far,"
9515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Suppose their valours crown’d, and cease. A few still stir their feet,"
9516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so a few with many fight, sperst thinly through the fleet."
9517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Retire then, leave speech to the rout, and all thy princes call,"
9518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, here, in counsels of most weight, we may resolve of all,"
9519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If having likelihood to believe that God will conquest give,"
9520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We shall charge through; or with this grace, make our retreat, and"
9521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,live.
9522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, I must needs affirm, I fear, the debt of yesterday"
9523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Since war is such a God of change) the Grecians now will pay.
9524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And since th’ insatiate man of war remains at fleet, if there"
9525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We tempt his safety, no hour more his hot soul can forbear.”"
9526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This sound stuff Hector lik’d, approv’d, jump’d from his chariot,"
9527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “Polydamas make good this place, and suffer not"
9528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One prince to pass it; I myself will there go, where you see"
9529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those friends in skirmish, and return (when they have heard from me"
9530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Command that your advice obeys) with utmost speed.” This said,"
9531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With day-bright arms, white plume, white scarf, his goodly limbs"
9532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"array’d,"
9533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He parted from them, like a hill, removing, all of snow,"
9534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to the Trojan peers and chiefs he flew, to let them know"
9535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The counsel of Polydamas. All turn’d, and did rejoice,"
9536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To haste to Panthus’ gentle son, being call’d by Hector’s voice;"
9537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, through the forefights making way, look’d for Deiphobus,"
9538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"King Helenus, Asiades, Hyrtasian Asius,"
9539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of whom, some were not to be found unhurt, or undeceas’d,"
9540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some only hurt, and gone from field. As further he address’d,"
9541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He found within the fight’s left wing the fair-hair’d Helen’s love
9542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By all means moving men to blows; which could by no means move
9543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hector’s forbearance, his friends’ miss so put his pow’rs in storm,"
9544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thus in wonted terms he chid: “You with the finest form,"
9545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Impostor, woman’s man! where are, in your care mark’d, all these,"
9546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deiphobus, King Helenus, Asius Hyrtacides,"
9547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Othryonëus Acamas? Now haughty Ilion
9548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shakes to his lowest groundwork. Now just ruin falls upon
9549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy head past rescue.” He replied: “Hector, why chid’st thou now,"
9550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When I am guiltless? Other times, there are for ease, I know,"
9551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than these, for she that brought thee forth, not utterly left me"
9552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without some portion of thy spirit, to make me brother thee."
9553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But since thou first brought’st in thy force, to this our naval fight,"
9554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I and my friends have ceaseless fought, to do thy service right."
9555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But all those friends thou seek’st are slain; excepting Helenus,"
9556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who parted wounded in his hand, and so Deiphobus;"
9557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Jove yet averted death from them. And now lead thou as far
9558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As thy great heart affects, all we will second any war"
9559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That thou endurest; and I hope, my own strength is not lost;"
9560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though least, I’ll fight it to his best; nor further fights the most.”"
9561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This calm’d hot Hector’s spleen; and both turn’d where they saw the
9562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,face
9563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of war most fierce, and that was where their friends made good the"
9564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,place
9565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About renown’d Polydamas, and god-like Polypæt,"
9566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Palmus, Ascanius, Morus that Hippotion did beget,"
9567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And from Ascania’s wealthy fields but ev’n the day before
9568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arriv’d at Troy, that with their aid they kindly might restore"
9569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some kindness they receiv’d from thence. And in fierce fight with
9570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"these,"
9571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Phalces and tall Orthæus stood, and bold Cebriones."
9572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then the doubt that in advice Polydamas disclos’d,"
9573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fight or fly, Jove took away, and all to fight dispos’d."
9574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And as the floods of troubled air to pitchy storms increase
9575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That after thunder sweeps the fields, and ravish up the seas,"
9576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Encount’ring with abhorréd roars, when the engrosséd waves"
9577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Boil into foam, and endlessly one after other raves;"
9578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So rank’d and guarded th’ Ilians march’d; some now, more now, and then"
9579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More upon more, in shining steel; now captains, then their men."
9580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Hector, like man-killing Mars, advanc’d before them all,"
9581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His huge round target before him, through thicken’d, like a wall."
9582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With hides well-couch’d with store of brass; and on his temples shin’d
9583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His bright helm, on which danc’d his plume; and in this horrid kind,"
9584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(All hid within his world-like shield) he ev’ry troop assay’d
9585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For entry, that in his despite stood firm and undismay’d."
9586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which when he saw, and kept more off, Ajax came stalking then,"
9587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus provok’d him: “O good man, why fright’st thou thus our men?"
9588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come nearer. Not art’s want in war makes us thus navy-bound,"
9589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But Jove’s direct scourge; his arm’d hand makes our hands give you
9590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,ground.
9591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet thou hop’st, of thyself, our spoil. But we have likewise hands"
9592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To hold our own, as you to spoil; and ere thy countermands"
9593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stand good against our ransack’d fleet, your hugely-peopled town"
9594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our hands shall take in, and her tow’rs from all their heights pull"
9595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,down.
9596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I must tell thee, time draws on, when, flying, thou shalt cry"
9597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To Jove and all the Gods to make thy fair-man’d horses fly
9598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More swift than falcons, that their hoofs may rouse the dust, and bear"
9599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy body, hid, to Ilion.” This said, his bold words were"
9600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Confirm’d as soon as spoke. Jove’s bird, the high-flown eagle, took"
9601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The right hand of their host; whose wings high acclamations strook
9602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From forth the glad breasts of the Greeks. Then Hector made reply:
9603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Vain-spoken man, and glorious, what hast thou said? Would I"
9604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As surely were the son of Jove, and of great Juno born,"
9605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Adorn’d like Pallas, and the God that lifts to earth the morn,"
9606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As this day shall bring harmful light to all your host, and thou,"
9607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If thou dar’st stand this lance, the earth before the ships shalt"
9608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"strow,"
9609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy bosom torn up, and the dogs, with all the fowl of Troy,"

9712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We all esteem’d invincible, and would past doubt repell"
9713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The world from both our fleet and us; it doth directly show

9736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus we should fit the wish of Troy, that, being something near"
9737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The victory, we give it clear; and we were sure to bear"
9738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A slaughter to the utmost man, for no man will sustain"
9739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A stroke, the fleet gone, but at that, look still, and wish him slain."
9740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore, prince of men, be sure, thy censure is unfit.”"
9741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Ithacus,” replied the king, “thy bitter terms have smit"
9742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My heart in sunder. At no hand, ’gainst any prince’s will"
9743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Do I command this. Would to God, that any man of skill"
9744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To give a better counsel would, or old, or younger man!"
9745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My voice should gladly go with his.” Then Diomed began:
9746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“The man not far is, nor shall ask much labour to bring in,"
9747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That willingly would speak his thoughts, if spoken they might win"
9748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fit ear, and suffer no impair, that I discover them,"
9749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being youngest of you; since my sire, that heir’d a diadem,"
9750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May make my speech to diadems decent enough, though he"
9751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lies in his sepulchre at Thebes. I boast this pedigree:
9752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Portheus three famous sons begot, that in high Calydon"
9753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Pleuron kept, with state of kings, their habitatión;"
9754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Agrius, Melas, and the third the horseman Oeneus,"
9755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My father’s father, that excell’d in actions generous"
9756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The other two. But these kept home, my father being driv’n"
9757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With wand’ring and advent’rous spirits, for so the King of heav’n"
9758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And th’ other Gods set down their wills, and he to Argos came,"
9759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where he begun the world, and dwelt. There marrying a dame,"
9760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One of Adrastus’ female race, he kept a royal house,"
9761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For he had great demesnes, good land, and, being industrious,"
9762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He planted many orchard-grounds about his house, and bred"
9763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great store of sheep. Besides all this, he was well qualitied,"
9764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And pass’d all Argives, for his spear. And these digressive things"
9765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are such as you may well endure, since (being deriv’d from kings,"
9766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And kings not poor nor virtueless) you cannot hold me base,"
9767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor scorn my words, which oft, though true, in mean men meet disgrace."
9768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"However, they are these in short: Let us be seen at fight,"
9769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yield to strong necessity, though wounded, that our sight"
9770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May set those men on that, of late, have to Achilles’ spleen"
9771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Been too indulgent, and left blows; but be we only seen,"
9772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not come within the reach of darts, lest wound on wound we lay;"
9773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which rev’rend Nestor’s speech implied, and so far him obey.”"
9774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This counsel gladly all observ’d, went on, Atrides led."
9775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor Neptune this advantage lost, but closely followéd,"
9776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And like an aged man appear’d t’ Atrides; whose right hand
9777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He seiz’d, and said: “Atrides, this doth passing fitly stand"
9778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With stern Achilles’ wreakful spirit, that he can stand astern"
9779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ship, and both in fight and death the Grecian bane discern,"
9780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since not in his breast glows one spark of any human mind.
9781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But be that his own bane. Let God by that loss make him find
9782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How vile a thing he is. For know, the blest Gods have not giv’n"
9783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thee ever over, but perhaps the Trojans may from heav’n"
9784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Receive that justice. Nay, ’tis sure, and thou shalt see their falls,"
9785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your fleet soon freed, and for fights here they glad to take their"
9786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,walls.”
9787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he made known who he was, and parted with a cry"
9788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As if ten thousand men had join’d in battle then, so high"
9789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His throat flew through the host; and so this great Earth-shaking God
9790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cheer’d up the Greek hearts, that they wish their pains no period."
9791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Saturnia from Olympus’ top saw her great brother there,"
9792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And her great husband’s brother too, exciting ev’rywhere"
9793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The glorious spirits of the Greeks; which as she joy’d to see,"
9794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So, on the fountful Ida’s top, Jove’s sight did disagree"
9795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With her contentment, since she fear’d that his hand would descend,"
9796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And check the Sea-god’s practices. And this she did contend
9797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How to prevent, which thus seem’d best: To deck her curiously,"
9798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And visit the Idalian hill, that so the Lightner’s eye"
9799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She might enamour with her looks, and his high temples steep,"
9800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n to his wisdom, in the kind and golden juice of sleep."
9801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So took she chamber, which her son, the God of ferrary,"
9802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With firm doors made, being joinèd close, and with a privy key"
9803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That no God could command but Jove; where, enter’d, she made fast"
9804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The shining gates, and then upon her lovely body cast"
9805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ambrosia, that first made it clear, and after laid on it"
9806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An od’rous, rich, and sacred oil, that was so wond’rous sweet"
9807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That ever, when it was but touch’d, it sweeten’d heav’n and earth."
9808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her body being cleans’d with this, her tresses she let forth,"
9809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And comb’d, her comb dipp’d in the oil, then wrapp’d them up in curls;"
9810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, thus her deathless head adorn’d, a heav’nly veil she hurls"
9811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On her white shoulders, wrought by Her that rules in housewif’ries,"
9812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who wove it full of antique works, of most divine device;"
9813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And this with goodly clasps of gold she fasten’d to her breast.
9814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then with a girdle, whose rich sphere a hundred studs impress’d,"
9815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She girt her small waist. In her ears, tenderly pierc’d, she wore"
9816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pearls, great and orient. On her head, a wreath not worn before"
9817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cast beams out like the sun. At last, she to her feet did tie"
9818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair shoes. And thus entire attir’d, she shin’d in open sky,"
9819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call’d the fair Paphian Queen apart from th’ other Gods, and said:"
9820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Lov’d daughter! Should I ask a grace, should I, or be obey’d?"
9821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or wouldst thou cross me, being incens’d, since I cross thee and take"
9822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks’ part, thy hand helping Troy?” She answer’d, “That shall"
9823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,make
9824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No diff’rence in a diff’rent cause. Ask, ancient Deity,"
9825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What most contents thee. My mind stands inclin’d as liberally
9826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To grant it as thine own to ask; provided that it be
9827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A favour fit and in my pow’r.” She, giv’n deceitfully,"
9828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus said: “Then give me those two pow’rs, with which both men and Gods"
9829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou vanquishest, Love and Desire; for now the periods"
9830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the many-feeding earth, and the original"
9831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Gods, Oceanus, and Thetis whom we call"
9832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our Mother, I am going to greet. They nurst me in their court,"
9833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And brought me up, receiving me in most respectful sort"
9834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Phæa, when Jove under earth and the unfruitful seas"
9835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cast Saturn. These I go to see, intending to appease"
9836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jars grown betwixt them, having long abstain’d from speech and bed;"
9837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which jars, could I so reconcile, that in their anger’s stead"
9838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I could place love, and so renew their first society,"
9839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I should their best lov’d be esteem’d, and honour’d endlessly.”"
9840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She answer’d: “’Tis not fit, nor just, thy will should be denied,"
9841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom Jove in his embraces holds.” This spoken, she untied,"
9842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And from her od’rous bosom took, her Ceston, in whose sphere"
9843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were all enticements to delight, all loves, all longings were,"
9844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kind conference, fair speech, whose pow’r the wisest doth inflame."
9845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This she resigning to her hands, thus urg’d her by her name:"
9846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Receive this bridle, thus fair-wrought, and put it ’twixt thy breasts,"
9847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Where all things to be done are done; and whatsoever rests
9848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In thy desire return with it.” The great-ey’d Juno smil’d,"
9849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And put it ’twixt her breasts. Love’s Queen, thus cunningly beguil’d,"
9850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Jove’s court flew. Saturnia, straight stooping from heav’n’s height,"
9851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pieria and Emathia, those countries of delight,"
9852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Soon reach’d, and to the snowy mounts, where Thracian soldiers dwell,"
9853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Approaching, pass’d their tops untouch’d. From Athos then she fell,"
9854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pass’d all the broad sea, and arriv’d in Lemnos, at the tow’rs"
9855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of godlike Thoas, where she met the Prince of all men’s pow’rs,"
9856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Death’s brother, Sleep; whose hand she took, and said: “Thou king of"
9857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"men,"
9858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prince of the Gods too, if before thou heard’st my suits, again"
9859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Give helpful ear, and through all times I’ll offer thanks to thee."
9860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lay slumber on Jove’s fi’ry eyes, that I may comfort me"
9861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With his embraces; for which grace I’ll grace thee with a throne
9862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Incorruptible, all of gold, and elegantly done"
9863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Mulciber, to which he forg’d a footstool for the ease"
9864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of thy soft feet, when wine and feasts thy golden humours please.”"
9865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sweet Sleep replied: “Satunia, there lives not any God,"
9866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides Jove, but I would becalm; aye if it were the Flood,"
9867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That fathers all the Deities, the great Oceanus;"
9868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Jove we dare not come more near, than he commandeth us."
9869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now you command me as you did, when Jove’s great-minded son,"
9870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alcides, having sack’d the town of stubborn Ilion,"
9871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Took sail from thence; when by your charge I pour’d about Jove’s mind
9872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A pleasing slumber, calming him, till thou drav’st up the wind,"
9873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all his cruelties, to sea, that set his son ashore"
9874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Cous, far from all his friends. Which, waking, vex’d so sore"
9875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The supreme Godhead, that he cast the Gods about the sky,"
9876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And me, above them all, he sought, whom he had utterly"
9877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hurl’d from the sparkling firmament, if all-gods-taming Night"
9878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Whom, flying, I besought for aid) had suffer’d his despite,"
9879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And not preserv’d me; but his wrath with my offence dispens’d,"
9880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For fear t’ offend her, and so ceas’d, though never so incens’d."
9881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now another such escape, you wish I should prepare.”"
9882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,She answer’d: “What hath thy deep rest to do with his deep care?
9883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As though Jove’s love to Ilion in all degrees were such
9884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As ’twas to Hercules his son, and so would storm as much"
9885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For their displeasure as for his? Away, I will remove"
9886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy fear with giving thee the dame, that thou didst ever love,"
9887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One of the fair young Graces born, divine Pasithae.”"
9888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This started Somnus into joy, who answer’d: “Swear to me,"
9889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By those inviolable springs, that feed the Stygian lake,"
9890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With one hand touch the nourishing earth, and in the other take"
9891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The marble sea, that all the Gods, of the infernal state,"
9892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which circle Saturn, may to us be witnesses, and rate"
9893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What thou hast vow’d; That with all truth, thou wilt bestow on me,"
9894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The dame I grant I ever lov’d, divine Pasithae.”"
9895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She swore, as he enjoin’d, in all, and strengthen’d all his joys"
9896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By naming all th’ infernal Gods, surnam’d the Titanois."
9897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The oath thus taken, both took way, and made their quick repair"

9899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At Lecton first they left the sea, and there the land they trod;"
9900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fountful nurse of savages, with all her woods, did nod"

9903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet, that he might see to Jove, he climb’d the goodliest tree"
9904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That all th’ Idalian mountain bred, and crown’d her progeny,"
9905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A fir it was, that shot past air, and kiss’d the burning sky;"
9906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There sate he hid in his dark arms, and in the shape with all"
9907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of that continual prating bird, whom all the Deities call"
9908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Chalcis, but men Cymmindis name. Saturnia tripp’d apace,"
9909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the top of Gargarus, and show’d her heav’nly face"
9910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Jupiter, who saw, and lov’d, and with as hot a fire,"
9911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being curious in her tempting view, as when with first desire"
9912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(The pleasure of it being stol’n) they mix’d in love and bed;
9913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, gazing on her still, he said: “Saturnia, what hath bred"

9915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That void of horse and chariot, fit for thy sov’reign state,"
9916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou lackiest here?” Her studied fraud replied: “My journey now
9917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Leaves state and labours to do good; and where in right I owe
9918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All kindness to the Sire of Gods, and our good Mother Queen"
9919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That nurst and kept me curiously in court (since both have been
9920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Long time at discord) my desire is to atone their hearts;
9921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And therefore go I now to see those earth’s extremest parts.
9922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For whose far-seat I spar’d my horse the scaling of this hill,"
9923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And left them at the foot of it; for they must taste their fill
9924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of travail with me, and must draw my coach through earth and seas,"
9925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose far-intended reach, respect, and care not to displease"
9926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy graces, made me not attempt, without thy gracious leave.”"
9927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The cloud-compelling God her guile in this sort did receive:
9928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Juno, thou shalt have after leave, but, ere so far thou stray,"
9929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Convert we our kind thoughts to love, that now doth ev’ry way"
9930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Circle with victory my pow’rs, nor yet with any dame,"
9931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Woman, or Goddess, did his fires my bosom so inflame"
9932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As now with thee. Not when it lov’d the parts so generous
9933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ixion’s wife had, that brought forth the wise Pirithous;"
9934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor when the lovely dame Acrisius’ daughter stirr’d
9935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My amorous pow’rs, that Perseus bore to all men else preferr’d;"
9936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor when the dame, that Phenix got, surpris’d me with her sight,"
9937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who the divine-soul’d Rhadamanth and Minos brought to light;
9938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor Semele, that bore to me the joy of mortal men,"
9939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sprightly Bacchus; nor the dame that Thebes renownéd then,"
9940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alcmena, that bore Hercules; Latona, so renown’d;"
9941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Queen Ceres, with the golden hair; nor thy fair eyes did wound"
9942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My entrails to such depth as now with thirst of amorous ease.”
9943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The cunning Dame seem’d much incens’d, and said: “What words are these,"
9944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Unsufferable Saturn’s son? What! Here! In Ida’s height!
9945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Desir’st thou this? How fits it us? Or what if in the sight
9946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of any God thy will were pleas’d, that he the rest might bring"
9947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To witness thy incontinence? ’Twere a dishonour’d thing.
9948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I would not show my face in heav’n, and rise from such a bed."
9949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, if love be so dear to thee, thou hast a chamberstead,"
9950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which Vulcan purposely contriv’d with all fit secrecy;
9951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There sleep at pleasure.” He replied: “I fear not if the eye
9952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of either God or man observe, so thick a cloud of gold"
9953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll cast about us that the sun, who furthest can behold,"
9954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall never find us.” This resolv’d, into his kind embrace"
9955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He took his wife. Beneath them both fair Tellus strew’d the place
9956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With fresh-sprung herbs, so soft and thick that up aloft it bore"
9957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their heav’nly bodies; with his leaves, did dewy lotus store"
9958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Th’ Elysian mountain; saffron flow’rs and hyacinths help’d make
9959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sacred bed; and there they slept. When suddenly there brake
9960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A golden vapour out of air, whence shining dews did fall,"
9961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which they wrapt them close, and slept till Jove was tam’d withal."
9962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mean space flew Somnus to the ships, found Neptune out, and said:"
9963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Now cheerfully assist the Greeks; and give them glorious head,"
9964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At least a little, while Jove sleeps; of whom through ev’ry limb"
9965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I pour’d dark sleep, Saturnia’s love hath so illuded him.”"
9966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This news made Neptune more secure in giving Grecians heart,"
9967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And through the first fights thus he stirr’d the men of most desert:
9968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Yet, Grecians, shall we put our ships, and conquest, in the hands"
9969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Priam’s Hector by our sloth? He thinks so, and commands"
9970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With pride according; all because, Achilles keeps away."
9971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alas, as we were nought but him! We little need to stay"
9972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his assistance, if we would our own strengths call to field,"
9973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And mutually maintain repulse. Come on then, all men yield"
9974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To what I order. We that bear best arms in all our hosts,"
9975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose heads sustain the brightest helms, whose hands are bristled most"
9976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With longest lances, let us on. But stay, I’ll lead you all;"
9977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor think I but great Hector’s spirits will suffer some appall,"
9978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though they be never so inspir’d. The ablest of us then,"
9979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That on our shoulders worst shields bear, exchange with worser men"
9980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That fight with better.” This propos’d, all heard it, and obey’d."
9981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The kings, ev’n those that suffer’d wounds, Ulysses, Diomed,"
9982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Agamemnon, helpt t’ instruct the cómplete army thus:"
9983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To good gave good arms, worse to worse, yet none were mutinous."
9984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus, arm’d with order, forth they flew; the great Earth-shaker led,"
9985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A long sword in his sinewy hand, which when he brandishéd"
9986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It lighten’d still, there was no law for him and it, poor men"
9987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must quake before them. These thus mann’d, illustrious Hector then"
9988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His host brought up. The blue-hair’d God and he stretch’d through the
9989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,prease
9990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A grievous fight; when to the ships and tents of Greece the seas
9991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brake loose, and rag’d. But when they join’d, the dreadful clamour rose"
9992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To such a height, as not the sea, when up the North-spirit blows"
9993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her raging billows, bellows so against the beaten shore;"
9994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor such a rustling keeps a fire, driven with violent blore"
9995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Through woods that grow against a hill; nor so the fervent strokes
9996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of almost-bursting winds resound against a grove of oaks;
9997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As did the clamour of these hosts, when both the battles clos’d."
9998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all which noble Hector first at Ajax’ breast dispos’d
9999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His jav’lin, since so right on him the great-soul’d soldier bore;"
10000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor miss’d it, but the bawdricks both that his broad bosom wore,"
10001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To hang his shield and sword, it strook; both which his flesh"
10002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,preserv’d.
10003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hector, disdaining that his lance had thus as good as swerv’d,"
10004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Trode to his strength; but, going off, great Ajax with a stone,"
10005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One of the many props for ships, that there lay trampled on,"
10006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strook his broad breast above his shield, just underneath his throat,"
10007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And shook him piecemeal; when the stone sprung back again, and smote"
10008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Earth, like a whirlwind, gath’ring dust with whirring fiercely round,"
10009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For fervour of his unspent strength, in settling on the ground."
10010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as when Jove’s bolt by the roots rends from the earth an oak,"
10011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sulphur casting with the blow a strong unsavoury smoke,"
10012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And on the fall’n plant none dare look but with amazéd eyes,"
10013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Jove’s thunder being no laughing game) so bow’d strong Hector’s
10014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"thighs,"
10015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so with tost-up heels he fell, away his lance he flung,"
10016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His round shield follow’d, then his helm, and out his armour rung."
10017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks then shouted, and ran in, and hop’d to hale him off,"
10018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore pour’d on darts in storms, to keep his aid aloof;"
10019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But none could hurt the people’s Guide, nor stir him from his ground;"
10020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sarpedon, prince of Lycia, and Glaucus so renown’d,"
10021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Agenor, Venus’ son, and wise Polydamas,"
10022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rush’d to his rescue, and the rest. No one neglective was"
10023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Hector’s safety. All their shields, they couch’d about him close,"
10024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rais’d him from earth, and (giving him, in their kind arms, repose)"
10025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From off the labour carried him, to his rich chariot,"
10026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And bore him mourning towards Troy. But when the flood they got
10027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of gulfy Xanthus, that was got by deathless Jupiter,"
10028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There took they him from chariot, and all besprinkled there"
10029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His temples with the stream. He breath’d, look’d up, assay’d to rise,"
10030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And on his knees stay’d spitting blood. Again then clos’d his eyes,"
10031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And back again his body fell. The main blow had not done
10032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet with his spirit. When the Greeks saw worthy Hector gone,"
10033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then thought they of their work, then charg’d with much more cheer the"
10034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"foe,"
10035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then, far first, Oïliades began the overthrow."
10036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He darted Satnius Enops’ son, whom famous Nais bore"
10037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As she was keeping Enops’ flocks on Satnius’ river’s shore,"
10038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And strook him in his belly’s rim, who upwards fell, and rais’d"
10039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A mighty skirmish with his fall. And then Panthœdés seiz’d
10040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prothenor Areilycides, with his revengeful spear,"
10041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his right shoulder, strook it through, and laid him breathless there;"
10042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For which he insolently bragg’d, and cried out: “Not a dart"
10043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From great-soul’d Panthus’ son, I think, shall ever vainlier part,"
10044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But some Greek’s bosom it shall take, and make him give his ghost.”"
10045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This brag the Grecians stomach’d much; but Telamonius most,"
10046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who stood most near Prothenor’s fall, and out he sent a lance,"
10047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which Panthus’ son, declining, ’scap’d, yet took it to sad chance"
10048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Archilochus, Antenor’s son, whom heav’n did destinate"
10049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To that stern end; ’twixt neck and head the jav’lin wrought his fate,"
10050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ran in at the upper joint of all the back long bone,"
10051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cut both the nerves; and such a load of strength laid Ajax on,"
10052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As that small part he seiz’d outweigh’d all th’ under limbs, and strook"
10053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His heels up, so that head and face the earth’s possessions took,"
10054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When all the low parts sprung in air; and thus did Ajax quit
10055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Panthœdes’ brave: “Now, Panthus’ son, let thy prophetic wit"
10056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Consider, and disclose a truth, if this man do not weigh"
10057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n with Prothenor. I conceive, no one of you will say"
10058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That either he was base himself, or sprung of any base;"
10059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antenor’s brother, or his son, he should be by his face;"
10060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One of his race, past question, his likeness shows he is,”"
10061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This spake he, knowing it well enough. The Trojans storm’d at this,"
10062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then slew Acamas, to save his brother yet engag’d,"
10063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bœotius, dragging him to spoil; and thus the Greeks enrag’d:"
10064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Greeks, ev’n born to bear our darts, yet ever breathing threats,"
10065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not always under tears and toils ye see our fortune sweats,"
10066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But sometimes you drop under death. See now your quick among
10067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our dead, intranc’d with my weak lance, to prove I have ere long"
10068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Reveng’d my brother. ’Tis the wish of ev’ry honest man
10069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His brother, slain in Mars’s field, may rest wreak’d in his fane.”"
10070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This stirr’d fresh envy in the Greeks, but urg’d Peneleus most,"
10071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who hurl’d his lance at Acamas; he ’scap’d; nor yet it lost
10072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The force he gave it, for it found the flock-rich Phorbas’ son,"
10073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ilionëus, whose dear sire, past all in Ilion,"
10074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was lov’d of Hermes, and enrich’d, and to him only bore"
10075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His mother this now slaughter’d man. The dart did undergore
10076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His eye-lid, by his eye’s dear roots, and out the apple fell,"
10077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The eye pierc’d through. Nor could the nerve that stays the neck repell
10078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His strong-wing’d lance, but neck and all gave way, and down he"
10079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,dropp’d.
10080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Peneleus then unsheath’d his sword, and from the shoulders chopp’d"
10081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His luckless head; which down he threw, the helm still sticking on,"
10082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And still the lance fix’d in his eye; which not to see alone
10083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Contented him, but up again he snatch’d, and show’d it all,"
10084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this stern brave: “Ilians, relate brave Ilionëus’ fall"
10085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his kind parents, that their roofs their tears may overrun;"
10086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For so the house of Promachus, and Alegenor’s son,"
10087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must with his wife’s eyes overflow, she never seeing more"
10088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her dear lord, though we tell his death, when to our native shore"
10089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We bring from ruin’d Troy our fleet, and men so long forgone.”"
10090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, and seen, pale fear possess’d all those of Ilion,"
10091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ev’ry man cast round his eye to see where death was not,"
10092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That he might fly him. Let not then his grac’d hand be forgot,"
10093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O Muses, you that dwell in heav’n, that first imbru’d the field"
10094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With Trojan spoil, when Neptune thus had made their irons yield."
10095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First Ajax Telamonius the Mysian captain slew,"
10096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Great Hyrtius Gyrtiades. Antilochus o’erthrew
10097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Phalces and Mermer, to their spoil. Meriones gave end"
10098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To Morys and Hyppotion. Teucer to fate did send
10099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Prothoon and Periphetes. Atrides’ jav’lin chac’d
10100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Duke Hyperenor, wounding him in that part that is plac’d"
10101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Betwixt the short ribs and the bones, that to the triple gut"
10102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have pertinence; the jav’lin’s head did out his entrails cut,"
10103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His forc’d soul breaking through the wound; night’s black hand clos’d
10104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,his eyes.
10105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Ajax, great Oïleus’ son, had divers victories,"
10106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For when Saturnius suffer’d flight, of all the Grecian race"

10212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then last, till in wrathful flames the long-sieg’d Ilion burn."
10213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva’s counsel shall become grave mean to this my will,"
10214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which no God shall neglect before Achilles take his fill
10215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of slaughter for his slaughter’d friend; ev’n Hector’s slaughter thrown
10216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Under his anger; that these facts may then make fully known
10217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My vow’s performance, made of late, and, with my bowéd head,"
10218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Confirm’d to Thetis, when her arms embrac’d my knees, and pray’d"
10219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That to her city-razing son I would all honour show.”
10220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This heard, his charge she seem’d t’ intend, and to Olympus flew."
10221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, as the mind of such a man that hath a great way gone,"
10222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And either knowing not his way, or then would let alone"
10223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His purpos’d journey, is distract, and in his vexéd mind"
10224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Resolves now not to go, now goes, still many ways inclin’d;"
10225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So rev’rend Juno headlong flew, and ’gainst her stomach striv’d,"
10226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, being amongst th’ immortal Gods in high heav’n soon arriv’d,"
10227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All rising, welcoming with cups her little absence thence,"
10228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She all their courtships overpass’d with solemn negligence,"
10229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Save that which fair-cheek’d Themis show’d, and her kind cup she took,"
10230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For first she ran and met with her, and ask’d: “What troubled look"
10231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She brought to heav’n? She thought, for truth, that Jove had terrified"
10232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her spirits strangely since she went.” The fair-arm’d Queen replied:
10233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“That truth may eas’ly be suppos’d; you, Goddess Themis, know"
10234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His old severity and pride, but you bear’t out with show,"
10235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And like the banquet’s arbiter amongst th’ Immortals’ fare,"
10236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though well you hear amongst them all, how bad his actions are;"
10237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor are all here, or anywhere, mortals, nor Gods, I fear,"
10238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Entirely pleas’d with what he does, though thus ye banquet here.”"
10239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus took she place, displeasedly; the feast in general"
10240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bewraying privy spleens at Jove; and then, to colour all,"
10241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She laugh’d, but merely from her lips, for over her black brows"
10242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her still-bent forehead was not clear’d; yet this her passion’s throes
10243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brought forth in spite, being lately school’d: “Alas, what fools are we"
10244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That envy Jove! Or that by act, word, thought, can fantasy"
10245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Any resistance to his will! He sits far off, nor cares,"
10246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor moves, but says he knows his strength, to all degrees compares"
10247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His greatness past all other Gods, and that in fortitude,"
10248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ev’ry other godlike pow’r, he reigns past all indu’d."
10249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For which great eminence all you Gods, whatever ill he does,"
10250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sustain with patience. Here is Mars, I think, not free from woes,"
10251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet he bears them like himself. The great God had a son,"
10252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom he himself yet justifies, one that from all men won"
10253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Just surname of their best belov’d, Ascalaphus; yet he,"
10254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Jove’s high grace to Troy, is slain.” Mars started horribly,"
10255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As Juno knew he would, at this, beat with his hurl’d-out hands"
10256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His brawny thighs, cried out, and said: “O you that have commands"
10257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In these high temples, bear with me, if I revenge the death"
10258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of such a son. I’ll to the fleet, and though I sink beneath"
10259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fate of being shot to hell, by Jove’s fell thunder-stone,"
10260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And lie all grim’d amongst the dead with dust and blood, my son"
10261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Revenge shall honour.” Then he charg’d Fear and Dismay to join
10262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His horse and chariot. He got arms, that over heav’n did shine"
10263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then a wrath more great and grave in Jove had been prepar’d
10264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the Gods than Juno caus’d, if Pallas had not car’d"
10265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More for the peace of heav’n than Mars; who leap’d out of her throne,"
10266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rapt up her helmet, lance, and shield, and made her fane’s porch groan"
10267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With her egression to his stay, and thus his rage defers:"
10268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Furious and foolish, th’ art undone! Hast thou for nought thine ears?"
10269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Heard’st thou not Juno being arriv’d from heav’n’s great  King but now?
10270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or wouldst thou he himself should rise, forc’d with thy rage, to show"
10271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The dreadful pow’r she urg’d in him, so justly being stirr’d?"
10272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Know, thou most impudent and mad, thy wrath had not inferr’d"
10273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mischief to thee, but to us all. His spirit had instantly"
10274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left both the hosts, and turn’d his hands to uproars in the sky,"
10275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Guilty and guiltless both to wrack in his high rage had gone.
10276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore, as thou lov’st thyself, cease fury for thy son;"
10277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Another, far exceeding him in heart and strength of hand,"
10278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or is, or will be shortly, slain. It were a work would stand"
10279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove in much trouble, to free all from death that would not die.”"
10280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This threat ev’n nail’d him to his throne; when heav’n’s chief Majesty
10281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call’d bright Apollo from his fane, and Iris that had place"
10282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of internunciess from the Gods, to whom she did the grace"
10283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Jupiter, to this effect: “It is Saturnius’ will,"
10284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That both, with utmost speed, should stoop to the Idalian hill,"
10285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To know his further pleasure there. And this let me advise,"
10286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When you arrive, and are in reach of his refulgent eyes,"
10287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His pleasure heard, perform it all, of whatsoever kind.”"
10288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus mov’d she back, and us’d her throne. Those two outstripp’d the"
10289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"wind,"
10290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Ida all-enchas’d with springs they soon attain’d, and found"
10291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where far-discerning Jupiter, in his repose, had crown’d"
10292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The brows of Gargarus, and wrapt an odorif’rous cloud"
10293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About his bosom. Coming near, they stood. Nor now he show’d"
10294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His angry count’nance, since so soon he saw they made th’ access"
10295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That his lov’d wife enjoin’d; but first the fair ambassadress
10296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He thus commanded: “Iris, go to Neptune, and relate"
10297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our pleasure truly, and at large. Command him from the fate"
10298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of human war, and either greet the Gods’ society,"
10299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or the divine sea make his seat. If proudly he deny,"
10300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let better counsels be his guides, than such as bid me war,"
10301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And tempt my charge, though he be strong, for I am stronger far,"
10302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And elder born. Nor let him dare, to boast even state with me"
10303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom all Gods else prefer in fear.” This said, down hasted she"
10304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Ida’s top to Ilion; and like a mighty snow,"
10305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or gelid hail, that from the clouds the northern spirit doth blow;"
10306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So fell the windy-footed dame, and found with quick repair"
10307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wat’ry God, to whom she said: “God with the sable hair,"
10308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I came from Ægis-bearing Jove, to bid thee cease from fight,"
10309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And visit heav’n, or th’ ample seas. Which if, in his despite,"
10310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or disobedience, thou deniest, he threatens thee to come,"
10311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In opposite fight, to field himself; and therefore warns thee home,"
10312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His hands eschewing, since his pow’r is far-superior,"
10313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His birth before thee; and affirms, thy lov’d heart should abhor"
10314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To vaunt equality with him, whom ev’ry Deity fears.”"
10315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: “O unworthy thing! Though he be great, he bears"
10316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His tongue too proudly, that ourself, born to an equal share"
10317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of state and freedom, he would force. Three brothers born we are"
10318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Saturn, Rhea brought us forth, this Jupiter, and I."
10319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Pluto, God of under-grounds. The world indiff’rently"
10320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dispos’d betwixt us; ev’ry one his kingdom; I the seas,"
10321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pluto the black lot, Jupiter the principalities"
10322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of broad heav’n, all the sky and clouds, was sorted out. The earth"
10323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And high Olympus common are, and due to either’s birth."
10324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Why then should I be aw’d by him? Content he his great heart
10325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his third portion, and not think, to amplify his part,"
10326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With terrors of his stronger hands, on me, as if I were"
10327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The most ignoble of us all. Let him contain in fear
10328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His daughters and his sons, begot by his own person, This"
10329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Holds more convenience. They must hear these violent threats of his.”
10330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Shall I,” said Iris, “bear from thee, an answer so austere?"
10331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or wilt thou change it? Changing minds, all noble natures bear."
10332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And well thou know’st, these greatest born, the Furies follow still.”"
10333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: “Iris, thy reply keeps time, and shows thy skill."
10334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O ’tis a most praiseworthy thing, when messengers can tell,"
10335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides their messages, such things, as fit th’ occasion well."
10336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But this much grieves my heart and soul, that being in pow’r and state"
10337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All-ways his equal, and so fix’d by one decree in fate,"
10338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He should to me, as under him, ill language give, and chide."
10339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet now, though still incens’d, I yield, affirming this beside,"
10340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And I enforce it with a threat: That if without consent
10341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of me, Minerva, Mercury, the Queen of regiment,"
10342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Vulcan, he will either spare high Ilion, or not race"
10343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her turrets to the lowest stone, and, with both these, not grace"
10344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks as victors absolute, inform him this from me—"
10345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His pride and my contempt shall live at endless enmity.”
10346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he left the Greeks, and rush’d into his wat’ry throne,"
10347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much miss’d of all th’ heroic host. When Jove discern’d him gone,"
10348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apollo’s service he employ’d, and said: “Lov’d Phœbus, go"
10349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Hector; now th’ earth-shaking God hath taken sea, and so"
10350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shrunk from the horrors I denounc’d; which standing, he, and all"
10351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The under-seated Deities, that circle Saturn’s fall,"
10352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had heard of me in such a fight as had gone hard for them.
10353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But both for them and me ’tis best, that thus they fly th’ extreme,"
10354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That had not pass’d us without sweat. Now then, in thy hands take"
10355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My adder-fring’d affrighting shield, which with such terror shake,"
10356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That fear may shake the Greeks to flight. Besides this, add thy care,"
10357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O Phœbus, far-off shooting God, that this so sickly fare"
10358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of famous Hector be recur’d, and quickly so excite"
10359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His amplest pow’rs, that all the Greeks may grace him with their"
10360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"flight,"
10361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n to their ships, and Hellespont; and then will I devise"
10362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All words and facts again for Greece, that largely may suffice"
10363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To breathe them from their instant toils.” Thus from th’ Idæan height,"
10364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like air’s swift pigeon-killer, stoop’d the far-shot God of light,"
10365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And found great Hector sitting up, not stretch’d upon his bed,"
10366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not wheezing with a stopp’d-up spirit, not in cold sweats, but fed"
10367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With fresh and comfortable veins, but his mind all his own,"
10368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But round about him all his friends, as well as ever known."
10369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And this was with the mind of Jove, that flew to him before"
10370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apollo came; who, as he saw no sign of any sore,"
10371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ask’d, like a cheerful visitant: “Why in this sickly kind,"
10372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Hector, sitt’st thou so apart? Can any grief of mind"
10373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Invade thy fortitude?” He spake, but with a feeble voice:"
10374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O thou, the best of Deities! Why, since I thus rejoice"
10375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By thy so serious benefit, demand’st thou, as in mirth,"
10376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to my face, if I were ill? For, more than what thy worth"
10377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must needs take note of, doth not Fame from all mouths fill thine ears,"
10378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, as my hand at th’ Achive fleet was making massacres"
10379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of men whom valiant Ajax led, his strength strook with a stone"
10380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All pow’r of more hurt from my breast? My very soul was gone,"
10381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And once to-day I thought to see the house of Dis and Death.”
10382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Be strong,” said he, “for such a spirit now sends the God of breath"
10383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From airy Ida, as shall run through all Greek spirits in thee."
10384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apollo with the golden sword, the clear Far-seer, see,"
10385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Him, who betwixt death and thy life, ’twixt ruin and those tow’rs,"
10386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ere this day oft hath held his shield. Come then, be all thy pow’rs"
10387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In wonted vigour, let thy knights with all their horse assay"
10388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Grecian fleet, myself will lead, and scour so clear the way,"
10389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That flight shall leave no Greek a rub.” Thus instantly inspir’d
10390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were all his nerves with matchless strength; and then his friends he
10391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,fir’d
10392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against their foes, when to his eyes his ears confirm’d the God."
10393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then, as a goodly-headed hart, or goat, bred in the wood,"
10394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A rout of country huntsmen chase, with all their hounds in cry,"
10395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The beast yet or the shady woods, or rocks excessive high,"
10396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Keep safe, or our unwieldy fates (that ev’n in hunters sway)"
10397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bar them the poor beast’s pulling down; when straight the clam’rous
10398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,fray
10399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Calls out a lion, hugely-man’d, and his abhorréd view"
10400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Turns headlong in unturning flight (though vent’rous) all the crew;
10401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So hitherto the chasing Greeks their slaughter dealt by troops;
10402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, after Hector was beheld range here and there, then stoops"
10403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The boldest courage, then their heels took in their drooping hearts,"
10404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then spake Andræmonides, a man of far-best parts"
10405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Ætolians, skill’d in darts, strenuous in fights of stand,"
10406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And one of whom few of the Greeks could get the better hand
10407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For rhetoric, when they fought with words; with all which being wise,"
10408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus spake he to his Grecian friends: “O mischief! Now mine eyes
10409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discern no little miracle; Hector escap’d from death,"
10410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all-recover’d, when all thought his soul had sunk beneath"
10411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The hands of Ajax. But some God hath sav’d and freed again
10412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Him that but now dissolv’d the knees of many a Grecian,"
10413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now I fear will weaken more; for, not without the hand"
10414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Him that thunders, can his pow’rs thus still the forefights stand,"
10415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus still triumphant. Hear me then: Our troops in quick retreat
10416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let’s draw up to our fleet, and we, that boast ourselves the great,"
10417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stand firm, and try if these that raise so high their charging darts"
10418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May be resisted. I believe, ev’n this great heart of hearts"
10419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will fear himself to be too bold, in charging thorow us.”"
10420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They eas’ly heard him, and obey’d; when all the generous"
10421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They call’d t’ encounter Hector’s charge, and turn’d the common men"
10422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Back to the fleet. And these were they, that bravely furnish’d then"
10423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fierce forefight: Th’ Ajaces both, the worthy Cretan king,"
10424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Mars-like Meges, Merion, and Teucer. Up then bring"
10425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojan chiefs their men in heaps; before whom, amply-pac’d,"
10426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"March’d Hector, and in front of him Apollo, who had cast"
10427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About his bright aspect a cloud, and did before him bear"
10428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove’s huge and each-where-shaggy shield, which, to contain in fear"
10429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Offending men, the God-smith gave to Jove; with this he led"
10430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Trojan forces. The Greeks stood. A fervent clamour spread
10431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The air on both sides as they join’d. Out flew the shafts and darts,"
10432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some falling short, but other some found butts in breasts and hearts."
10433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As long as Phœbus held but out his horrid shield, so long"
10434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The darts flew raging either way, and death grew both ways strong;"
10435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when the Greeks had seen his face, and, who it was that shook"
10436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bristled targe, knew by his voice, then all their strengths forsook"
10437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their nerves and minds. And then look how a goodly herd of neat,"
10438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or wealthy flock of sheep, being close, and dreadless at their meet,"
10439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In some black midnight, suddenly, and not a keeper near,"
10440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A brace of horrid bears rush in, and then fly here and there"
10441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The poor affrighted flocks or herds; so ev’ry way dispers’d
10442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The heartless Grecians, so the Sun their headstrong chace revers’d"
10443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To headlong flight, and that day rais’d, with all grace, Hector’s head."
10444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arcesilaus then he slew, and Stichius; Stichius led"
10445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bœotia’s brazen-coated men; the other was the friend
10446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of mighty-soul’d Menestheüs. Æneas brought to end
10447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Medon and Jasus; Medon was the brother, though but base,"
10448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of swift Oïliades, and dwelt, far from his breeding place,"
10449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Phylace; the other led th’ Athenian bands, his sire"
10450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was Spelus, Bucolus’s son. Mecistheus did expire"
10451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath Polydamas’s hand. Polites, Echius slew,"
10452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Just at the joining of the hosts. Agenor overthrew
10453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Clonius. Bold Deïochus felt Alexander’s lance;
10454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It strook his shoulder’s upper part, and did his head advance"
10455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Quite through his breast, as from the fight he turn’d him for retreat."
10456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While these stood spoiling of the slain, the Greeks found time to get"
10457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beyond the dike and th’ undik’d pales; all scapes they gladly gain’d,"
10458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till all had pass’d the utmost wall; Necessity so reign’d.
10459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Hector cried out: “Take no spoil, but rush on to the fleet;"
10460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From whose assault, for spoil or flight, if any man I meet,"
10461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He meets his death; nor in the fire of holy funeral
10462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His brother’s or his sister’s hands shall cast within our wall
10463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His loathéd body; but, without, the throats of dogs shall grave"
10464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His manless limbs.” This said, the scourge his forward horses drave"
10465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through ev’ry order; and, with him, all whipp’d their chariots on,"
10466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All threat’ningly, out-thund’ring shouts as earth were overthrown."
10467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before them march’d Apollo still, and, as he march’d, digg’d down,"
10468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without all labour, with his feet the dike, till, with his own,"
10469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He fill’d it to the top, and made way both for man and horse"
10470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As broad and long as with a lance, cast out to try one’s force,"
10471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A man could measure. Into this they pour’d whole troops as fast
10472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As num’rous; Phœbus still, before, for all their haste,"
10473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still shaking Jove’s unvalu’d shield, and held it up to all."
10474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then, as he had chok’d their dike, he tumbled down their wall."
10475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And look how eas’ly any boy, upon the sea-ebb’d shore,"
10476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Makes with a little sand a toy, and cares for it no more,"
10477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But as he rais’d it childishly, so in his wanton vein,"
10478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both with his hands and feet he pulls, and spurns it down again;"
10479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So slight, O Phœbus, thy hands made of that huge Grecian toil,"
10480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And their late stand, so well-resolv’d, as eas’ly mad’st recoil."
10481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus stood they driv’n up at their fleet; where each heard other’s
10482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"thought,"
10483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exhorted, passing humbly pray’d, all all the Gods besought,"
10484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With hands held up to heav’n, for help. ’Mongst all the good old man,"
10485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grave Nestor, for his counsels call’d the Argives’ guardian,"
10486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fell on his aged knees, and pray’d, and to the starry host"
10487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stretch’d out his hands for aid to theirs, of all thus moving most:"
10488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O father Jove, if ever man, of all our host, did burn"
10489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fat thighs of oxen or of sheep, for grace of safe return,"
10490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In fruitful Argos, and obtain’d the bowing of thy head"
10491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For promise of his humble pray’rs, O now remember him,"
10492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou merely heav’nly, and clear up the foul brows of this dim"
10493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And cruel day; do not destroy our zeal for Trojan pride.”
10494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He pray’d, and heav’n’s great Counsellor with store of thunder tried"
10495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His former grace good, and so heard the old man’s hearty pray’rs."
10496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans took Jove’s sign for them, and pour’d out their affairs"
10497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In much more violence on the Greeks, and thought on nought but fight."
10498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as a huge wave of a sea, swoln to his rudest height,"
10499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Breaks over both sides of a ship, being all-urg’d by the wind,"
10500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For that’s it makes the wave so proud; in such a borne-up kind
10501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans overgat the wall, and, getting in their horse,"
10502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fought close at fleet, which now the Greeks ascended for their force."
10503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then from their chariots they with darts, the Greeks with bead-hooks"
10504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"fought,"
10505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kept still aboard for naval fights, their heads with iron wrought"
10506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In hooks and pikes. Achilles’ friend, still while he saw the wall,"
10507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That stood without their fleet, afford employment for them all,"
10508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was never absent from the tent of that man-loving Greek,"
10509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Late-hurt Eurypylus, but sate, and ev’ry way did seek,"
10510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To spend the sharp time of his wound, with all the ease he could"
10511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In med’cines, and in kind discourse. But when he might behold"
10512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans past the wall, the Greeks flight-driv’n, and all in cries,"
10513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then cried he out, cast down his hands, and beat with grief his thighs,"
10514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then, “O Eurypylus,” he cried, “now all thy need of me"
10515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must bear my absence, now a work of more necessity"
10516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Calls hence, and I must haste to call Achilles to the field."
10517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who knows, but, God assisting me, my words may make him yield?"
10518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The motion of a friend is strong.” His feet thus took him thence.
10519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The rest yet stood their enemies firm; but all their violence
10520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Though Troy fought there with fewer men) lack’d vigour to repell
10521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those fewer from their navy’s charge, and so that charge as well"
10522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lack’d force to spoil their fleet or tents. And as a shipwright’s line
10523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Dispos’d by such a hand as learn’d from th’ Artizan divine
10524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The perfect practice of his art) directs or guards so well
10525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The naval timber then in frame, that all the laid-on steel"
10526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Can hew no further than may serve, to give the timber th’ end"
10527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fore-purpos’d by the skilful wright; so both hosts did contend
10528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such a line or law applied, to what their steel would gain."
10529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At other ships fought other men; but Hector did maintain
10530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His quarrel firm at Ajax’ ship. And so did both employ
10531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About one vessel all their toil; nor could the one destroy
10532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ship with fire, nor force the man, nor that man yet get gone"
10533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The other from so near his ship, for God had brought him on."
10534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But now did Ajax, with a dart, wound deadly in the breast"
10535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Caletor, son of Clytius, as he with fire address’d"
10536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To burn the vessel; as he fell, the brand fell from his hand."
10537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Hector saw his sister’s son lie slaughter’d in the sand,"
10538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He call’d to all his friends, and pray’d they would not in that strait"
10539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forsake his nephew, but maintain about his corse the fight,"
10540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And save it from the spoil of Greece. Then sent he out a lance
10541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At Ajax, in his nephew’s wreak; which miss’d, but made the chance"
10542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On Lycophron Mastorides, that was the household friend"
10543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Ajax, born in Cythera; whom Ajax did defend,"
10544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being fled to his protectión, for killing of a man"
10545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst the god-like Cytherans. The vengeful jav’lin ran
10546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Quite through his head, above his ear, as he was standing by"
10547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fautour then astern his ship, from whence his soul did fly,"
10548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to the earth his body fell. The hair stood up an end
10549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On Ajax, who to Teucer call’d (his brother) saying: “Friend"
10550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our lovéd consort, whom we brought from Cythera, and grac’d"
10551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So like our father, Hector’s hand hath made him breathe his last."
10552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where then are all thy death-borne shafts, and that unvalu’d bow"
10553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apollo gave thee?” Teucer straight his brother’s thoughts did know,"
10554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood near him, and dispatch’d a shaft, amongst the Trojan fight."
10555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It strook Pisenor’s goodly son, young Clitus, the delight"
10556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of the renown’d Polydamas, the bridle in his hand,"
10557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As he was labouring his horse, to please the high command"
10558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Hector and his Trojan friends, and bring him where the fight"
10559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made greatest tumult; but his strife, for honour in their sight,"
10560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wrought not what sight or wishes help’d; for, turning back his look,"
10561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hollow of his neck the shaft came singing on, and strook,"
10562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And down he fell; his horses back, and hurried through the field"
10563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The empty chariot. Panthus’ son made all haste, and withheld"
10564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their loose career, disposing them to Protiaon’s son,"
10565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Astynous, with special charge, to keep them ever on,"
10566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in his sight. So he again, amongst the foremost went."
10567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At Hector then another shaft, incenséd Teucer sent,"
10568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, had it hit him, sure had hurt, and, had it hurt him, slain,"
10569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, had it slain him, it had driv’n all those to Troy again."
10570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Jove’s mind was not sleeping now, it wak’d to Hector’s fame,"
10571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Teucer’s infamy; himself (in Teucer’s deadly aim)
10572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His well-wrought string dissevering, that serv’d his bravest bow;"
10573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His shaft flew quite another way, his bow the earth did strow."
10574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At all which Teucer stood amaz’d, and to his brother cried:"
10575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O prodigy! Without all doubt, our angel doth deride"
10576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The counsels of our fight; he brake a string my hands put on
10577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This morning, and was newly made, and well might have set gone"
10578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A hundred arrows; and, beside, he strook out of my hand"
10579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The bow Apollo gave.” He said: “Then, good friend, do not stand"
10580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More on thy archery, since God, preventer of all grace"
10581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Desir’d by Grecians, slights it so. Take therefore in the place"
10582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A good large lance, and on thy neck a target cast as bright,"
10583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With which come fight thyself with some, and other some excite,"
10584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That without labour at the least, though we prove worser men,"
10585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Troy may not brag it took our ships. Come, mind our business, then.”"
10586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he hasted to his tent, left there his shafts and bow,"
10587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then his double double shield did on his shoulders throw;
10588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon his honour’d head he plac’d his helmet thickly-plum’d,"
10589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then his strong and well-pil’d lance in his fair hand assum’d,"
10590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Return’d; and boldly took his place, by his great brother’s side."
10591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Hector saw his arrows broke, out to his friends he cried:"
10592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O friends, be yet more comforted; I saw the hands of Jove"
10593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Break the great Grecian archer’s shafts. ’Tis easy to approve
10594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That Jove’s pow’r is direct with men; as well in those set high
10595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon the sudden, as in those depress’d as suddenly,"
10596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And those not put in state at all. As now he takes away
10597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strength from the Greeks, and gives it us; then use it, and assay"
10598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With join’d hands this approachéd fleet. If any bravely buy
10599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fame or fate with wounds or death, in Jove’s name let him die."
10600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who for his country suffers death, sustains no shameful thing,"
10601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wife in honour shall survive, his progeny shall spring"
10602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In endless summers, and their roofs with patrimony swell."
10603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all this, though, with all their freight, the Greek ships we"
10604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,repell.”
10605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His friends thus cheer’d; on th’ other part, strong Ajax stirr’d his"
10606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,friends:
10607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Greeks,” said he, “what shame is this, that no man more defends"
10608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fame and safety, than to live, and thus be forc’d to shrink!"
10609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now either save your fleet, or die; unless ye vainly think"
10610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That you can live and they destroy’d. Perceives not ev’ry ear
10611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How Hector heartens up his men, and hath his fire-brands here"
10612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now ready to inflame our fleet? He doth not bid them dance,"
10613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That you may take your ease and see, but to the fight advance."
10614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No counsel can serve us but this: To mix both hands and hearts,"
10615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bear up close. ’Tis better much, t’ expose our utmost parts"
10616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To one day’s certain life or death, than languish in a war"
10617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So base as this, beat to our ships by our inferiors far.”"
10618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus rous’d he up their spirits and strengths. To work then both sides
10619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"went,"
10620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Hector the Phocensian duke to fields of darkness sent,"
10621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fierce Schedius, Perimedes’ son; which Ajax did requite"
10622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With slaughter of Laodamas, that led the foot to fight,"
10623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And was Antenor’s famous son. Polydamas did end
10624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Otus, surnam’d Cyllenius, whom Phydas made his friend,"
10625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being chief of the Epeians’ bands. Whose fall when Meges view’d,"
10626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He let fly at his feller’s life; who, shrinking in, eschew’d"
10627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The well-aim’d lance; Apollo’s will denied that Panthus’ son
10628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should fall amongst the foremost fights; the dart the mid-breast won
10629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Crasmus; Meges won his arms. At Meges, Dolops then"
10630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bestow’d his lance; he was the son of Lampus, best of men,"
10631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Lampus of Laomedon, well-skill’d in strength of mind,"
10632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He strook Phylides’ shield quite through, whose curets, better lin’d,"
10633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And hollow’d fitly, sav’d his life. Phyleus left him them,"
10634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who from Epirus brought them home, on that part where the stream"
10635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of famous Seléés doth run; Euphetes did bestow,"
10636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being guest with him, those well-prov’d arms, to wear against the foe,"
10637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now they sav’d his son from death. At Dolops, Meges threw"
10638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A spear well-pil’d, that strook his casque full in the height; off flew"
10639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His purple feather, newly made, and in the dust it fell."
10640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While these thus striv’d for victory, and either’s hope serv’d well,"
10641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Atrides came to Meges’ aid, and, hidden with his side,"
10642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let loose a jav’lin at his foe, that through his back implied"
10643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His lusty head, ev’n past his breast; the ground receiv’d his weight."
10644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While these made in to spoil his arms, great Hector did excite"
10645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All his allies to quick revenge; and first he wrought upon
10646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strong Manalippus, that was son to great Hycetaon,"
10647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With some reproof. Before these wars, he in Percote fed"
10648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Clov’n-foot’d oxen, but did since return where he was bred,"
10649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Excell’d amongst the Ilians, was much of Priam lov’d,"
10650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And in his court kept as his son. Him Hector thus reprov’d:
10651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Thus, Menalippus, shall our blood accuse us of neglect?"
10652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor moves it thy lov’d heart, thus urg’d, thy kinsman to protect?"
10653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Seest thou not how they seek his spoil? Come, follow, now no more"
10654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our fight must stand at length, but close; nor leave the close before"
10655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We close the latest eye of them, or they the lowest stone"
10656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tear up, and sack the citizens of lofty Ilion.”"
10657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He led; he follow’d, like a God. And then must Ajax needs,"
10658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As well as Hector, cheer his men, and thus their spirits he feeds:"
10659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Good friends, bring but yourselves to feel the noble stings of shame"
10660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For what ye suffer, and be men. Respect each other’s fame;"
10661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For which who strives in shame’s fit fear, and puts on ne’er so far,"
10662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Comes oft’ner off. Then stick engag’d; these fugitives of war
10663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Save neither life, nor get renown, nor bear more mind than sheep.”"
10664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This short speech fir’d them in his aid, his spirit touch’d them deep,"
10665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And turn’d them all before the fleet into a wall of brass;
10666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whose assault Jove stirr’d their foes, and young Atrides was"
10667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove’s instrument, who thus set on the young Antilochus:"
10668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Antilochus, in all our host, there is not one of us"
10669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More young than thou, more swift of foot, nor, with both those, so"
10670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,strong.
10671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O would thou wouldst then, for thou canst, one of this lusty throng,"
10672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That thus comes skipping out before (whoever, any where)"
10673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Make stick, for my sake, ’twixt both hosts, and leave his bold blood"
10674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,there!”
10675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He said no sooner, and retir’d, but forth he rush’d before"
10676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The foremost fighters, yet his eye did ev’ry way explore"
10677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For doubt of odds; out flew his lance; the Trojans did abstain
10678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While he was darting; yet his dart he cast not off in vain,"
10679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Menalippus, that rare son of great Hycetaon,"
10680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As bravely he put forth to fight, it fiercely flew upon;"
10681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And at the nipple of his breast, his breast and life did part."
10682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then, much like an eager hound, cast off at some young hart"
10683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hurt by the hunter, that had left his covert then but new,"
10684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The great-in-war Antilochus, O Menalippus, flew"
10685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On thy torn bosom for thy spoil. But thy death could not lie
10686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hid to great Hector; who all haste made to thee, and made fly"
10687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antilochus, although in war he were at all parts skill’d."
10688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But as some wild beast, having done some shrewd turn (either kill’d"
10689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The herdsman, or the herdsman’s dog) and skulks away before"
10690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The gather’d multitude makes in; so Nestor’s son forbore,"
10691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But after him, with horrid cries, both Hector and the rest"
10692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Show’rs of tear-thirsty lances pour’d; who having arm’d his breast
10693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all his friends, he turn’d it then. Then on the ships all Troy,"
10694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like raw-flesh-nourish’d lions, rush’d, and knew they did employ"
10695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their pow’rs to perfect Jove’s high will; who still their spirits
10696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"enflam’d,"
10697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And quench’d the Grecians’; one renown’d, the other often sham’d."
10698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Hector’s glory still he stood, and ever went about"
10699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make him cast the fleet such fire, as never should go out;"
10700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Heard Thetis’ foul petitión, and wish’d in any wise"
10701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The splendour of the burning ships might satiate his eyes.
10702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From him yet the repulse was then to be on Troy conferr’d,"
10703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The honour of it giv’n the Greeks; which thinking on, he stirr’d,"
10704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such addition of his spirit, the spirit Hector bore"
10705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To burn the fleet, that of itself was hot enough before."
10706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But now he far’d like Mars himself, so brandishing his lance"
10707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As, through the deep shades of a wood, a raging fire should glance,"
10708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Held up to all eyes by a hill; about his lips a foam
10709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood as when th’ ocean is enrag’d, his eyes were overcome"
10710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With fervour, and resembled flames, set off by his dark brows,"
10711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And from his temples his bright helm abhorréd lightnings throws;
10712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Jove, from forth the sphere of stars, to his state put his own,"
10713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all the blaze of both the hosts confin’d in him alone.
10714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all this was, since after this he had not long to live,"
10715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This lightning flew before his death, which Pallas was to give"
10716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(A small time thence, and now prepar’d) beneath the violence"
10717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of great Pelides. In mean time, his present eminence"
10718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thought all things under it; and he, still where he saw the stands"
10719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of greatest strength and bravest arm’d, there he would prove his hands,"
10720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or nowhere; off’ring to break through, but that pass’d all his pow’r,"
10721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Although his will were past all theirs, they stood him like a tow’r"
10722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Conjoin’d so firm, that as a rock, exceeding high and great,"
10723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And standing near the hoary sea, bears many a boist’rous threat"
10724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of high-voic’d winds and billows huge, belch’d on it by the storms;"
10725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So stood the Greeks great Hector’s charge, nor stirr’d their battellous"
10726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,forms.
10727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, girt in fire borne for the fleet, still rush’d at ev’ry troop,"
10728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And fell upon it like a wave, high rais’d, that then doth stoop"
10729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out from the clouds, grows, as it stoops, with storms, then down doth"
10730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,come
10731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And cuff a ship, when all her sides are hid in brackish foam,"
10732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strong gales still raging in her sails, her sailors’ minds dismay’d,"
10733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Death being but little from their lives; so Jove-like Hector fray’d
10734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And plied the Greeks, who knew not what would chance, for all their"
10735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,guards.
10736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as the baneful king of beasts, leapt into oxen herds"
10737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fed in the meadows of a fen, exceeding great; the beasts"
10738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In number infinite; ’mongst whom (their herdsmen wanting breasts
10739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fight with lions, for the price of a black ox’s life)"
10740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He here and there jumps, first and last, in his blood-thirsty strife,"
10741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Chas’d and assaulted; and, at length, down in the midst goes one,"
10742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all the rest spers’d through the fen; so now all Greece was gone;
10743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So Hector, in a flight from heav’n upon the Grecians cast,"
10744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Turn’d all their backs; yet only one his deadly lance laid fast,"
10745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brave Mycenæus Periphes, Cypræus’ dearest son,"
10746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who of the heav’n’s-Queen-lovéd king, great Eurysthæus, won"
10747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The grace to greet in ambassy the strength of Hercules,"
10748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was far superior to his sire in feet, fight, nobleness"
10749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the virtues, and all those did such a wisdom guide"
10750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As all Mycena could not match; and this man dignified,"
10751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still making greater his renown, the state of Priam’s son,"
10752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For his unhappy hasty foot, as he address’d to run,"
10753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stuck in th’ extreme ring of his shield, that to his ancles reach’d,"
10754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And down he upwards fell, his fall up from the centre fetch’d"
10755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A huge sound with his head and helm; which Hector quickly spied,"
10756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ran in, and in his worthy breast his lance’s head did hide;"
10757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And slew about him all his friends, who could not give him aid,"
10758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They griev’d, and of his god-like foe fled so extreme afraid."
10759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now amongst the nearest ships, that first were drawn to shore,"
10760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks were driv’n; beneath whose sides, behind them, and before,"
10761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And into them they pour’d themselves, and thence were driv’n again"
10762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to their tents, and there they stood; not daring to maintain"
10763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their guards more outward, but, betwixt the bounds of fear and shame,"
10764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cheer’d still each other; when th’ old man, that of the Grecian name"
10765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was call’d the Pillar, ev’ry man thus by his parents pray’d:"
10766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O friends, be men, and in your minds let others’ shames be weigh’d."
10767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Know you have friends besides yourselves, possessions, parents, wives,"
10768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As well those that are dead to you, as those ye love with lives;"
10769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All sharing still their good, or bad, with yours. By these I pray,"
10770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That are not present (and the more should therefore make ye weigh
10771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their miss of you, as yours of them) that you will bravely stand,"
10772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And this forc’d flight you have sustain’d, at length yet countermand.”"
10773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Supplies of good words thus supplied the deeds and spirits of all.
10774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so at last Minerva clear’d, the cloud that Jove let fall"
10775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before their eyes; a mighty light flew beaming ev’ry way,"
10776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As well about their ships, as where their darts did hottest play,"
10777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then saw they Hector great in arms, and his associates,"
10778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As well all those that then abstain’d, as those that help’d the fates,"
10779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all their own fight at the fleet. Nor did it now content
10780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ajax to keep down like the rest; he up the hatches went,"
10781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stalk’d here and there, and in his hand a huge great bead-hook held,"
10782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve cubits long, and full of iron. And as a man well-skill’d"
10783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In horse, made to the martial race, when, of a number more,"
10784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He chooseth four, and brings them forth, to run them all before"
10785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Swarms of admiring citizens, amids their town’s high way,"
10786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, in their full career, he leaps from one to one, no stay"
10787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enforc’d on any, nor fails he, in either seat or leap;"
10788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So Ajax with his bead-hook leap’d nimbly from ship to ship,"
10789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As actively commanding all, them in their men as well"
10790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As men in them, most terribly exhorting to repell,"
10791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To save their navy and their tents. But Hector nothing needs
10792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To stand on exhortations now at home, he strives for deeds."
10793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And look how Jove’s great queen of birds, sharp-set, looks out for"
10794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"prey,"
10795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Knows floods that nourish wild-wing’d fowls, and, from her airy way,"
10796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beholds where cranes, swans, cormorants, have made their foody fall,"
10797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Darkens the river with her wings, and stoops amongst them all;"
10798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So Hector flew amongst the Greeks, directing his command,"
10799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In chief, against one opposite ship; Jove with a mighty hand"
10800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Still backing him and all his men. And then again there grew
10801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A bitter conflict at the fleet. You would have said none drew
10802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A weary breath, nor ever would, they laid so freshly on."
10803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And this was it that fir’d them both: The Greeks did build upon
10804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No hope but what the field would yield, flight an impossible course;"
10805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans all hope entertain’d, that sword and fire should force"
10806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both ships and lives of all the Greeks. And thus, unlike affects"
10807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bred like strenuity in both. Great Hector still directs
10808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His pow’rs against the first near ship. ’Twas that fair bark that
10809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,brought
10810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Protesilaus to those wars, and now her self to nought,"
10811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With many Greek and Trojan lives, all spoil’d about her spoil."
10812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One slew another desp’rately, and close the deadly toil"
10813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was pitch’d on both parts. Not a shaft, nor far-off striking dart"
10814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was us’d through all. One fight fell out, of one despiteful heart."
10815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sharp axes, twybills, two-hand swords, and spears with two heads borne,"
10816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were then the weapons; fair short swords, with sanguine hilts still"
10817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"worn,"
10818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had use in like sort; of which last, ye might have numbers view’d"
10819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Drop with dissolv’d arms from their hands, as many down-right hew’d"
10820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From off their shoulders as they fought, their bawdrics cut in twain."
10821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus the black blood flow’d on earth, from soldiers hurt and slain."
10822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Hector once had seiz’d the ship, he clapt his fair broad hand"
10823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fast on the stern, and held it there, and there gave this command:"
10824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Bring fire, and all together shout. Now Jove hath drawn the veil"
10825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From such a day as makes amends, for all his storms of hail;"
10826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By whose blest light we take those ships, that, in despite of heav’n,"
10827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took sea, and brought us worlds of woe, all since our peers were giv’n"
10828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To such a laziness and fear; they would not let me end
10829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our ling’ring banes, and charge thus home, but keep home and defend,"
10830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And so they rul’d the men I led. But though Jove then withheld
10831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My natural spirit, now by Jove ’tis freed, and thus impell’d.”"
10832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This more inflam’d them; in so much that Ajax now no more
10833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kept up, he was so drown’d in darts; a little he forbore"
10834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hatches to a seat beneath, of sev’n foot long, but thought"
10835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It was impossible to scape; he sat yet where he fought,"
10836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And hurl’d out lances thick as hail, at all men that assay’d"
10837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fire the ship; with whom he found his hands so overlaid,"
10838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That on his soldiers thus he cried: “O friends, fight I alone?"
10839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Expect ye more walls at your backs? Towns rampir’d here are none,"
10840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No citizens to take ye in, no help of any kind."
10841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We are, I tell you, in Troy’s fields; have nought but seas behind,"
10842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And foes before; far, far from Greece. For shame, obey commands,"
10843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There is no mercy in the wars; your healths lie in your hands.”
10844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus rag’d he, and pour’d out his darts. Whoever he espied"
10845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come near the vessel arm’d with fire, on his fierce dart he died."
10846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All that pleas’d Hector made him mad, all that his thanks would earn;"
10847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of which twelve men, his most resolv’d, lay dead before his stern."

10899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But these much-med’cine-knowing men, physicians, can recure,"
10900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou yet unmed’cinable still, though thy wound all endure,"
10901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Heav’n bless my bosom from such wrath as thou sooth’st as thy bliss,"
10902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unprofitably virtuous. How shall our progenies,"
10903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Born in thine age, enjoy thine aid, when these friends, in thy flow’r,"

10916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For his sure death; of all whose speech Achilles first renew’d
10917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The last part thus: “O worthy friend, what have thy speeches been?"
10918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I shun the fight for oracles, or what my mother queen"
10919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath told from Jove? I take no care, nor note of one such thing!"
10920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But this fit anger stings me still, that the insulting king"
10921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should from his equal take his right, since he exceeds in pow’r."
10922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This, still his wrong, is still my grief: He took my paramour"

10924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, for her, overturn’d a town. This rape he made of her,"

10926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That is no city libertine, nor capable of their gown."
10927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But bear we this as out of date; ’tis past, nor must we still"
10928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Feed anger in our noblest parts; yet thus, I have my will"
10929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As well as our great king of men, for I did ever vow"
10930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Never to cast off my disdain till, as it falls out now,"
10931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their miss of me knock’d at my fleet, and told me in their cries"
10932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I was reveng’d, and had my wish of all my enemies."
10933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so of this repeat enough. Take thou my fame-blaz’d arms,"
10934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And my fight-thirsty Myrmidons lead to these hot alarms.
10935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whole clouds of Trojans circle us with hateful eminence;
10936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks shut in a little shore, a sort of citizens"
10937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Skipping upon them; all because their proud eyes do not see
10938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The radiance of my helmet there, whose beams had instantly"
10939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrust back, and all these ditches fill’d with carrion of their flesh,"
10940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If Agamemnon had been kind; where now they fight as fresh,"
10941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As thus far they had put at ease, and at our tents contend."
10942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And may; for the repulsive hand of Diomed doth not spend
10943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His raging darts there, that their death could fright out of our fleet;"
10944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor from that head of enmity, can my poor hearers meet"
10945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The voice of great Atrides now. Now Hector’s only voice
10946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Breaks all the air about both hosts, and, with the very noise"
10947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bred by his loud encouragements, his forces fill the field,"
10948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And fight the poor Achaians down. But on, put thou my shield"
10949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Betwixt the fire-plague and our fleet. Rush bravely on, and turn"
10950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,War’s tide as headlong on their throats. No more let them ajourn
10951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our sweet home-turning. But observe the charge I lay on thee
10952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To each least point, that thy rul’d hand may highly honour me,"
10953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And get such glory from the Greeks, that they may send again"
10954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My most sweet wench, and gifts to boot, when thou hast cast a rein"
10955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On these so headstrong citizens, and forc’d them from our fleet."
10956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With which grace if the God of sounds thy kind egression greet;[1]
10957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Retire, and be not tempted on (with pride to see thy hand"
10958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rain slaughter’d carcasses on earth) to run forth thy command
10959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As far as Ilion, lest the Gods, that favour Troy, come forth"
10960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thy encounter, for the Sun much loves it; and my worth,"
10961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In what thou suffer’st, will be wrong’d, that I would let my friend"
10962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Assume an action of such weight without me, and transcend"
10963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His friend’s prescription. Do not then affect a further fight
10964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than I may strengthen. Let the rest, when thou hast done this right,"
10965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Perform the rest. O would to Jove, thou Pallas, and thou Sun,"
10966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That not a man hous’d underneath those tow’rs of Ilion,"
10967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor anyone of all the Greeks, how infinite a sum"
10968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Soever all together make, might live unovercome;"
10969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But only we two, ’scaping death, might have the thund’ring down"
10970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of ev’ry stone stuck in the walls of this so sacred town!”
10971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus spake they only ’twixt themselves. And now the foe no more
10972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Could Ajax stand, being so oppress’d with all the iron store"
10973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans pour’d on; with whose darts, and with Jove’s will beside,"
10974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His pow’rs were cloy’d, and his bright helm did deaf’ning blows abide,"
10975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His plume, and all bead-ornaments, could never hang in rest."
10976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His arm yet labour’d up his shield, and having done their best,"
10977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They could not stir him from his stand, although he wrought it out"
10978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With short respirings, and with sweat, that ceaseless flow’d about"
10979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His reeking limbs; no least time giv’n to take in any breath;
10980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ill strengthen’d ill; when one was up, another was beneath."
10981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now, Muses, you that dwell in heav’n, the dreadful mean inspire,"
10982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That first enforc’d the Grecian fleet, to take in Trojan fire."
10983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First Hector, with his huge broad sword, cut off, at setting on,"
10984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The head of Ajax’ ashen lance; which Ajax seeing gone,"
10985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that he shook a headless spear, a little while unware,"
10986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His wary spirits told him straight the hand of Heav’n was there;
10987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And trembling under his conceit, which was that ’twas Jove’s deed,"
10988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, as be poll’d off his dart’s heads, so sure he had decreed"
10989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That all the counsels of their war, he would poll off like it,"
10990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And give the Trojans victory; so trusted he his wit,"
10991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And left his darts. And then the ship was heap’d with horrid brands
10992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of kindling fire; which instantly was seen through all the strands
10993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In unextinguishable flames, that all the ship embrac’d."
10994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then Achilles beat his thighs, cried out, “Patroclus, haste,"
10995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Make way with horse. I see at fleet, a fire of fearful rage."
10996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arm, arm, lest all our fleet it fire, and all our pow’r engage."
10997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arm quickly, I’ll bring up the troops.” To these so dreadful wars"
10998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus, in Achilles’ arms, enlighten’d all with stars,"
10999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And richly amell’d, all haste made. He wore his sword, his shield,"
11000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His huge-plum’d helm, and two such spears, as he could nimbly wield."
11001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But the most fam’d Achilles’ spear, big, solid, full of weight,"
11002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He only left of all his arms; for that far pass’d the might
11003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of any Greek to shake but his; Achilles’ only ire
11004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shook that huge weapon, that was giv’n by Chiron to his sire,"
11005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cut from the top of Pelion, to be heroës’ deaths."
11006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His steeds Automedon straight join’d; like whom no man that breathes,"
11007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Next Peleus’ son, Patroclus lov’d; for, like him, none so great"
11008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He found in faith at ev’ry fight, nor to out-look a threat,"
11009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Automedon did therefore guide for him Achilles’ steeds,"
11010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Xanthius and Balius swift as wind, begotten by the seeds"
11011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Zephyr, and the Harpy born, Podarge, in a mead"
11012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close to the wavy oceán, where that fierce Harpy fed."
11013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Automedon join’d these before, and with the hindmost gears"
11014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He fasten’d famous Pedasus, whom, from the massacres"
11015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made by Achilles, when he took Eëtion’s wealthy town,"
11016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He brought, and, though of mortal race, yet gave him the renown"
11017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To follow his immortal horse. And now, before his tents,"
11018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself had seen his Myrmidons, in all habiliments"
11019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of dreadful war. And when ye see, upon a mountain bred,[2]"
11020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A den of wolves, about whose hearts unmeasur’d strengths are fed,"
11021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"New come from currie of a stag, their jaws all blood-besmear’d,"
11022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And when from some black-water fount they all together herd,"
11023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There having plentifully lapp’d, with thin and thrust out tongues,"
11024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The top and clearest of the spring, go belching from their lungs"
11025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The clotter’d gore, look dreadfully, and entertain no dread,"
11026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their bellies gaunt all taken up, with being so rawly fed;"
11027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then say, that such, in strength and look, were great Achilles’ men"
11028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Now order’d for the dreadful fight; and so with all them then
11029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their princes and their chiefs did show, about their Gen’ral’s friend;"
11030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His friend, and all, about himself; who chiefly did intend"
11031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ embattelling of horse and foot. To that siege, held so long,"
11032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twice-five-and-twenty sail he brought, twice-five-and-twenty strong"
11033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of able men was ev’rv sail. Five colonels he made
11034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all those forces; trusty men, and all of pow’r to lead,"
11035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But he of pow’r beyond them all. Menesthius was one,"
11036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That ever wore discolour’d arms; he was a river’s son
11037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That fell from heav’n, and good to drink was his delightful stream,"
11038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His name unwearied Sperchius, he lov’d the lovely dame"
11039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair Polydora, Peleus’ seed, and dear in Borus’ sight,"
11040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And she to that celestial Flood gave this Menesthius light,"
11041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A woman mixing with a God. Yet Borus bore the name
11042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of father to Menesthius, he marrying the dame,"
11043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And giving her a mighty dow’r; he was the kind descent
11044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Perieres. The next man, renown’d with regiment,"
11045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was strong Eudorus, brought to life by one suppos’d a maid,"
11046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bright Polymela, Phylas’ seed, but had the wanton play’d"
11047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With Argus-killing Mercury; who (fir’d with her fair eyes,"
11048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As she was singing in the quire of Her that makes the cries
11049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In clam’rous hunting, and doth bear the crooked bow of gold)"
11050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stole to her bed in that chaste room, that Phœbe chaste did hold,"
11051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And gave her that swift-warlike son, Eudorus, brought to light"
11052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As she was dancing; but as soon, as She that rules the plight"
11053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of labouring women eas’d her throes, and show’d her son the sun,"
11054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strong Echecæus, Actor’s heir, woo’d earnestly, and won"
11055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her second favour, feeing her with gifts of infinite prize;"
11056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And after brought her to his house, where, in his grandsire’s eyes,"
11057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Old Phylas, Polymela’s son obtain’d exceeding grace,"
11058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And found as careful bringing up, as of his natural race"
11059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He had descended. The third chief was fair Mæmalides
11060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pisandrus, who in skill of darts obtain’d supremest praise"
11061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Myrmidons, except their lord’s companion."
11062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fourth charge, aged Phœnix had. The fifth, Alcimedon,"
11063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Son of Laerces, and much fam’d. All these digested thus"
11064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In fit place by the mighty son of royal Peleüs,"
11065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This stern remembrance he gave all: “You, Myrmidons,” said he,"
11066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Lest any of you should forget his threat’nings us’d to me
11067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this place, and, through all the time, that my just anger reign’d,"
11068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Attempting me with bitter words, for being so restrain’d,"
11069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For my hot humour, from the fight, remember them as these:"
11070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Thou cruel son of Peleüs, whom She that rules the seas"
11071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did only nourish with her gall, thou dost ungently hold"
11072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our hands against our wills from fight. We will not be controll’d,"
11073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But take our ships, and sail for home, before we loiter here"
11074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And feed thy fury.’ These high words exceeding often were
11075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The threats that, in your mutinous troops, ye us’d to me for wrath"
11076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To be detain’d so from the field. Now then, your spleens may bathe"
11077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In sweat of those great works ye wish’d; now, he that can employ"
11078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A gen’rous heart, go fight, and fright these bragging sons of Troy.”"
11079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This set their minds and strengths on fire, the speech enforcing well,"
11080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being us’d in time; but, being their king’s, it much more did impell,"
11081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And closer rush’d in all the troops. And as, for buildings high,"
11082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mason lays his stones more thick, against th’ extremity"
11083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of wind and weather, and ev’n then, if any storm arise,"
11084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He thickens them the more for that, the present act so plies"
11085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His honest mind to make sure work; so, for the high estate"
11086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This work was brought to, these men’s minds, according to the rate,"
11087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were rais’d, and all their bodies join’d; but their well-spoken king,"
11088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his so timely-thought-on speech, more sharp made valour’s sting,"
11089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thicken’d so their targets boss’d, so all their helmets then,"
11090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That shields propp’d shields, helms helmets knock’d, and men encourag’d"
11091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,men.
11092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus and Automedon did arm before them all,"
11093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Two bodies with one mind inform’d; and then the General
11094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Betook him to his private tent, where from a coffer wrought"
11095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Most rich and curiously, and giv’n by Thetis to be brought"
11096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his own ship, top-fill’d with vests, warm robes to check cold wind,"
11097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And tapestries all gold’n-fring’d, and curl’d with thrumbs behind,"
11098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took a most unvalu’d bowl, in which none drank but he;"
11099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor he but to the Deities, nor any Deity"
11100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But Jove himself was serv’d with that; and that he first did cleanse
11101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With sulphur, then with fluences of sweetest water rense;"
11102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then wash’d his hands, and drew himself a mighty bowl of wine,"
11103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which (standing midst the place enclos’d for services divine,"
11104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And looking up to heav’n and Jove, who saw him well) he pour’d"
11105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon the place of sacrifice, and humbly thus implor’d:"
11106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Great Dodonæus, president of cold Dodone’s tow’rs,"
11107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Pelasgicus, that dwellest far hence; about whose bow’rs"
11108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ austere prophetic Selli dwell, that still sleep on the ground,"
11109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go bare, and never cleanse their feet; as I before have found"
11110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grace to my vows, and hurt to Greece, so now my pray’rs intend."
11111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I still stay in the gather’d fleet, but have dismiss’d my friend,"
11112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst my many Myrmidons, to danger of the dart;"
11113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O grant his valour my renown, arm with my mind his heart!"
11114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Hector’s self may know my friend can work in single war,"
11115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And not then only show his hands, so hot and singular,"
11116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When my kind presence seconds him. But, fight he ne’er so well,"
11117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No further let him trust his fight, but, when he shall repell"
11118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Clamour and danger from our fleet, vouchsafe a safe retreat"
11119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To him and all his companies, with fames and arms complete.”"
11120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He pray’d, and heav’n’s great Counsellor gave satisfying ear"
11121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To one part of his orisons, but left the other there;"
11122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He let him free the fleet of foes, but safe retreat denied."
11123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles left that utter part where he his zeal applied,"
11124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And turn’d into his inner tent, made fast his cup, and then"
11125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood forth, and with his mind beheld the foes fight; and his men,"
11126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That follow’d his great-minded friend, embattled till they brake"
11127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With gallant spirit upon the foe. And as fell wasps, that make"
11128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their dwellings in the broad high-way, which foolish children use"
11129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Their cottages being near their nests) to anger and abuse
11130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With ever vexing them, and breed (to soothe their childish war)"
11131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A common ill to many men, since if a traveller"
11132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(That would his journey’s end apply, and pass them unassay’d)"
11133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come near and vex them, upon him the children’s faults are laid,"
11134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For on they fly as he were such, and still defend their own;"
11135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So far’d it with the fervent mind of ev’ry Myrmidon,"
11136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who pour’d themselves out of their fleet upon their wanton foes,"
11137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That needs would stir them, thrust so near, and cause the overthrows"
11138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of many others, that had else been never touch’d by them,"
11139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor would have touch’d. Patroclus then put his wind to the stream,"
11140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus exhorted: “Now, my friends, remember you express"
11141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your late-urg’d virtue, and renown our great Æacides."
11142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, he being strong’st of all the Greeks, his eminence may dim"
11143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All others likewise in our strengths, that far off imitate him:"
11144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Agamemnon now may see his fault as general
11145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As his place high, dishonouring him that so much honours all.”"
11146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus made he sparkle their fresh fire, and on they rush’d; the fleet"
11147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fill’d full her hollow sides with sounds, that terribly did greet"
11148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Th’ amazed Trojans; and their eyes did second their amaze
11149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When great Menœtius’ son they saw, and his friend’s armour blaze."
11150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All troops stood troubled, with conceit that Peleus’ son was there,"
11151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His anger cast off at the ships; and each look’d ev’rywhere
11152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For some authority to lead the then preparéd flight.
11153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Patroclus greeted with a lance the region where the fight
11154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made strongest tumult, near the ship Protesilaus brought,"
11155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And strook Pyræchmen; who before the fair-helmed Pæons fought,"
11156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Led from Amydon, near whose walls the broad-stream’d Axius flows."
11157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through his right shoulder flew the dart, whose blow strook all the"
11158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,blows
11159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his pow’r from his pow’rless arm, and down he groaning fell;"
11160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His men all flying, their leader fled. This one dart did repell"
11161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The whole guard plac’d about the ship, whose fire extinct, half burn’d"
11162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Pæons left her, and full cry to clam’rous flight return’d."
11163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then spread the Greeks about their ships; triumphant tumult flow’d:
11164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, as from top of some steep hill the Lightner strips a cloud,"
11165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And lets a great sky out from heav’n, in whose delightsome light"
11166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All prominent foreheads, forests, tow’rs, and temples cheer the sight;"
11167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So clear’d these Greeks this Trojan cloud, and at their ships and tents"
11168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Obtain’d a little time to breathe, but found no present vents"
11169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To their inclusions; nor did Troy, though these Pæonians fled,"
11170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lose any ground, but from this ship they needfully turn’d head."
11171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then ev’ry man a man subdu’d. Patroclus in the thigh
11172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strook Areilycus; his dart the bone did break, and fly"
11173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Quite through, and sunk him to the earth. Good Menelaus slew"
11174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Accomplish’d Thoas, in whose breast, being nak’d, his lance he threw"
11175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Above his shield, and freed his soul. Phylides, taking note"
11176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That bold Amphiclus bent at him, prevented him, and smote"
11177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His thigh’s extreme part, where of man his fattest muscle lies,"
11178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The nerves torn with his lance’s pile, and darkness clos’d his eyes."
11179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antilochus Atymnius seiz’d, his steel lance did impress"
11180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His first three guts, and loos’d his life. At young Nestorides,"
11181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Maris, Atymnius’ brother, flew; and at him Thrasymed"
11182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The brother to Antilochus; his eager jav’lin’s head
11183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The muscles of his arm cut out, and shiver’d all the bone;"
11184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Night clos’d his eyes, his lifeless corse his brother fell upon."
11185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so by two kind brothers’ hands, did two kind brothers bleed;"
11186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both being divine Sarpedon’s friends, and were the darting seed"
11187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Amisodarus, that kept the bane of many men"
11188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Abhorr’d Chimæra; and such bane now caught his childeren.
11189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ajax Oïliades did take Cleobulus alive,"
11190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Invading him stay’d by the press; and at him then let drive
11191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With his short sword that cut his neck; whose blood warm’d all the
11192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"steel,"
11193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And cold Death with a violent fate his sable eyes did seel.
11194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Peneleüs, and Lycon cast together off their darts;"
11195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both miss’d, and both together then went with their swords; in parts"
11196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The blade and hilt went, laying on upon the helmet’s height."
11197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Peneleus’ sword caught Lycon’s neck, and cut it thorough quite."
11198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His head hung by the very skin. The swift Meriones,"
11199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pursuing flying Acamas, just as he got access"
11200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To horse and chariot overtook, and took him such a blow"
11201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his right shoulder, that he left his chariot, and did strow"
11202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The dusty earth; life left his limbs, and night his eyes possess’d."
11203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Idomenæus his stern dart at Erymas address’d,"
11204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As, like to Acamas, he fled; it cut the sundry bones"
11205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath his brain, betwixt his neck, and foreparts; and so runs,"
11206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shaking his teeth out, through his mouth, his eyes all drown’d in"
11207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"blood,"
11208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So through his nostrils and his mouth, that now dart-open stood,"
11209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He breath’d his spirit. Thus had death from ev’ry Grecian chief
11210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A chief of Troy. For, as to kids, or lambs, their cruell’st thief,"
11211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wolf, steals in, and, when he sees that by the shepherd’s sloth"
11212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The dams are spers’d about the hills, then serves his rav’nous tooth"
11213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With ease, because his prey is weak; so serv’d the Greeks their foes,"
11214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discerning well how shrieking flight did all their spirits dispose,"
11215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their biding virtues quite forgot. And now the natural spleen
11216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Ajax bore to Hector still, by all means, would have been"
11217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within his bosom with a dart; but he that knew the war,"
11218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Well-cover’d in a well-lin’d shield, did well perceive how far"
11219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The arrows and the jav’lins reach’d, by being within their sounds"
11220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ominous singings; and observ’d the there-in-clining bounds
11221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Conquest in her aid of him, and so obey’d her change,"
11222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took safest course for him and his, and stood to her as strange."
11223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as, when Jove intends a storm, he lets out of the stars,"
11224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From steep Olympus, a black cloud, that all heav’n’s splendour bars"
11225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From men on earth; so from the hearts of all the Trojan host
11226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All comfort lately found from Jove, in flight and cries was lost."
11227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor made they any fair retreat. Hector’s unruly horse
11228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would needs retire him, and he left engag’d his Trojan force,"
11229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forc’d by the steepness of the dike, that in ill place they took,"
11230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And kept them that would fain have gone. Their horses quite forsook
11231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A number of the Trojan kings, and left them in the dike;"
11232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their chariots in their foreteams broke. Patroclus then did strike
11233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While steel was hot, and cheer’d his friends; nor meant his enemies"
11234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"good,"
11235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, when they once began to fly, each way receiv’d a flood,"
11236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And chok’d themselves with drifts of dust. And now were clouds begot
11237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Beneath the clouds; with flight and noise the horse neglected not
11238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their home intendments; and, where rout was busiest, there pour’d on"
11239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Patroclus most exhorts and threats; and then lay overthrown
11240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Numbers beneath their axle-trees; who, lying in flight’s stream,"
11241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made th’ after chariots jot and jump, in driving over them."
11242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ immortal horse Patroclus rode, did pass the dike with ease,"
11243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And wish’d the depth and danger more; and Menœtiades
11244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As great a spirit had to reach, retiring Hector’s haste,"
11245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But his fleet horse had too much law, and fetch’d him off too fast."
11246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And as in Autumn the black earth is loaden with the storms
11247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Jove in gluts of rain pours down, being angry with the forms"
11248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of judgment in authoriz’d men, that in their courts maintain,"
11249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With violent office, wrested laws, and (fearing Gods, nor men)"
11250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exile all justice; for whose fault, whole fields are overflown,"
11251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And many valleys cut away with torrents headlong thrown
11252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From neighbour mountains, till the sea receive them roaring in,"
11253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And judg’d men’s labours then are vain, plagu’d for their judge’s sin;"
11254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So now the foul defaults of some all Troy were laid upon;
11255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So like those torrents roar’d they back to windy Ilion;
11256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And so like tempests blew the horse with ravishing back again
11257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those hot assailants, all their works at fleet now render’d vain."
11258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus, when he had dispers’d the foremost phalanxes,"
11259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call’d back his forces to the fleet, and would not let them prease,"
11260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As they desir’d, too near the town; but ’twixt the ships and flood,"
11261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And their steep rampire, his hand steep’d Revenge in seas of blood."
11262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Pronous was first that fell beneath his fi’ry lance,"
11263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which strook his bare breast, near his shield. The second Thestor’s"
11264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"chance,"
11265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Old Enops’ son, did make himself; who shrinking, and set close"
11266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his fair seat, ev’n with th’ approach Patroclus made, did lose"
11267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All manly courage, insomuch that from his hands his reins"
11268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fell flowing down, and his right jaw Patroclus’ lance attains,"
11269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strock through his teeth, and there it stuck, and by it to him drew"
11270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dead Thestor to his chariot. It show’d, as when you view"
11271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,An angler from some prominent rock draw with his line and hook
11272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A mighty fish out of the sea; for so the Greek did pluck
11273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojan gaping from his seat, his jaws op’d with the dart;"
11274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which when Patroclus drew, he fell; his life and breast did part."
11275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then rush’d he on Erylaus; at whom he hurl’d a stone,"
11276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which strake his head so in the midst, that two was made of one;"
11277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two ways it fell, cleft through his casque. And then Tlepolemus,"
11278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Epaltes, Damastorides, Evippus, Echius,"
11279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ipheas, bold Amphoterus, and valiant Erymas,"
11280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Polymelus, by his sire surnam’d Argeadas,"
11281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He heap’d upon the much-fed earth. When Jove’s most worthy son,"
11282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Sarpedon, saw these friends thus stay’d, and others run,"
11283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O shame! Why fly ye?” then he cried, “Now show ye feet enow."
11284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On, keep your way, myself will meet the man that startles you,"
11285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make me understand his name that flaunts in conquest thus,"
11286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And hath so many able knees so soon dissolv’d to us.”
11287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Down jump’d he from his chariot; down leap’d his foe as light.
11288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as, on some far-looking rock, a cast of vultures fight,"
11289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fly on each other, strike and truss, part, meet, and then stick by,"
11290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tug both with crooked beaks and seres, cry, fight, and fight and cry;"
11291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So fiercely fought these angry kings, and show’d as bitter galls."
11292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove, turning eyes to this stern fight, his wife and sister calls,"
11293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And much mov’d for the Lycian Prince, said: “O that to my son"
11294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fate, by this day and man, should cut a thread so nobly spun!"
11295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two minds distract me; if I should now ravish him from fight,"
11296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And set him safe in Lycia; or give the Fates their right.”
11297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Austere Saturnius,” she replied, “what unjust words are these?"
11298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A mortal, long since mark’d by fate, wouldst thou immortalize?"
11299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Do, but by no God be approv’d. Free him, and numbers more,"
11300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sons of Immortals, will live free, that death must taste before"
11301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These gates of Ilion; ev’ry God will have his son a God,"
11302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or storm extremely. Give him then an honest period
11303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In brave fight by Patroclus’ sword, if he be dear to thee,"
11304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And grieves thee for his danger’d life; of which when he is free,"
11305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let Death and Somnus bear him hence, till Lycia’s natural womb"
11306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Receive him from his brother’s hands, and citizens’; a tomb"
11307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And column rais’d to him. This is the honour of the dead.”
11308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She said, and her speech rul’d his pow’r; but in his safety’s stead,"
11309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For sad ostent of his near death, he steep’d his living name"
11310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In drops of blood heav’n swet for him, which earth drunk to his fame."
11311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now, as this high combat grew to this too humble end,"
11312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sarpedon’s death had this state more; ’twas usher’d by his friend
11313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And charioteer, brave Thrasymed; whom in his belly’s rim"
11314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus wounded with his lance, and endless ended him."
11315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then another act of name foreran his princely fate.
11316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His first lance missing, he let fly a second that gave date"
11317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of violent death to Pedasus; who, as he joy’d to die"
11318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By his so honourable hand, did ev’n in dying neigh."
11319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ruin startled th’ other steeds, the gears crack’d, and the reins"
11320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Strappled his fellows; whose misrule Automedon restrains
11321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By cutting the intangling gears, and so dissund’ring quite"
11322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The brave slain beast; when both the rest obey’d, and went foreright."
11323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then the royal combatants fought for the final stroke;
11324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Lycia’s Gen’ral miss’d again, his high-rais’d jav’lin took"
11325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Above his shoulder empty way. But no such speedless flight
11326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus let his spear perform, that on the breast did light"
11327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his brave foe, where life’s strings close about the solid heart,"
11328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Impressing a recureless wound; his knees then left their part,"
11329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And let him fall; when like an oak, a poplar, or a pine,"
11330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"New fell’d by arts-men on the hills, he stretch’d his form divine"
11331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before his horse and chariot. And as a lion leaps
11332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon a goodly yellow bull, drives all the herd in heaps,"
11333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, under his unconquer’d jaws, the brave beast sighing dies;"
11334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So sigh’d Sarpedon underneath this prince of enemies,"
11335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call’d Glaucus to him, his dear friend, and said: “Now, friend, thy"
11336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,hands
11337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Much duty owe to fight and arms; now for my love it stands
11338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy heart in much hand to approve that war is harmful; now
11339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How active all thy forces are, this one hour’s act must show."
11340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First call our Lycian captains up, look round, and bring up all,"
11341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all exhort to stand, like friends, about Sarpedon’s fall,"
11342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And spend thyself thy steel for me; for be assur’d no day
11343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all thy life, to thy last hour, can clear thy black dismay"
11344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In woe and infamy for me, if I be taken hence"
11345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Spoil’d of mine arms, and thy renown despoil’d of my defence."
11346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stand firm then, and confirm thy men.” This said, the bounds of death"
11347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Concluded all sight to his eyes, and to his nosthrils breath."
11348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus, though his guard was strong, forc’d way through ev’ry doubt,"
11349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Climb’d his high bosom with his foot, and pluck’d his jav’lin out,"
11350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with it drew the film and strings of his yet panting heart;
11351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And last, together with the pile, his princely soul did part."
11352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His horse, spoil’d both of guide and king, thick snoring and amaz’d,"
11353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And apt to flight, the Myrmidons made nimbly to, and seiz’d."
11354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Glaucus, to hear his friend ask aid, of him past all the rest,"
11355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though well he knew his wound uncur’d, confusion fill’d his breast"
11356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not to have good in any pow’r, and yet so much good will."
11357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And (laying his hand upon his wound, that pain’d him sharply still,"
11358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And was by Teucer’s hand set on from their assail’d steep wall,"
11359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In keeping hurt from other men) he did on Phœbus call,"
11360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The God of med’cines, for his cure: “Thou King of cures,” said he,"
11361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“That art perhaps in Lycia with her rich progeny,"
11362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or here in Troy; but any where, since thou hast pow’r to hear,"
11363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O give a hurt and woeful man, as I am now, thine ear."
11364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This arm sustains a cruel wound, whose pains shoot ev’ry way,"
11365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Afflict this shoulder, and this hand, and nothing long can stay"
11366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A flux of blood still issuing; nor therefore can I stand
11367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any enemy in fight, nor hardly make my hand"
11368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Support my lance; and here lies dead the worthiest of men,"
11369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sarpedon, worthy son to Jove, whose pow’r could yet abstain"
11370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From all aid in this deadly need; give thou then aid to me,"
11371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,O King of all aid to men hurt; assuage th’ extremity
11372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of this arm’s anguish, give it strength, that by my precedent"
11373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I may excite my men to blows, and this dead corse prevent"
11374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of further violence.” He pray’d, and kind Apollo heard,"
11375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Allay’d his anguish, and his wound of all the black blood clear’d"
11376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That vex’d it so, infus’d fresh pow’rs into his weaken’d mind;"
11377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all his spirits flow’d with joy that Phœbus stood inclin’d,"
11378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In such quick bounty, to his pray’rs. Then, as Sarpedon will’d,"
11379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He cast about his greedy eye; and first of all instill’d
11380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all his captains all the stings, that could inflame their fight"
11381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For good Sarpedon. And from them, he stretch’d his speedy pace"
11382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ Agenor, Hector, Venus’ son, and wise Polydamas;"
11383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And (only naming Hector) said: “Hector, you now forget"
11384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your poor auxiliary friends, that in your toils have swet"
11385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their friendless souls out far from home. Sarpedon, that sustain’d"
11386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With justice, and his virtues all, broad Lycia, hath not gain’d"
11387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The like guard for his person here; for yonder dead he lies
11388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath the great Patroclus’ lance. But come, let your supplies,"
11389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good friends, stand near him. O disdain to see his corse defil’d"
11390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With Grecian fury; and his arms, by their oppressions spoil’d."
11391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These Myrmidons are come enrag’d, that such a mighty boot"
11392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Greeks Troy’s darts have made at fleet.” This said, from head to"
11393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,foot
11394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grief strook their pow’rs past patience, and not to be restrain’d,"
11395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To hear news of Sarpedon’s death; who, though he appertain’d"
11396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To other cities, yet to theirs he was the very fort,"
11397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And led a mighty people there, of all whose better sort"
11398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Himself was best. This made them run in flames upon the foe;
11399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The first man Hector, to whose heart Sarpedon’s death did go."
11400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus stirr’d the Grecian spirits; and first th’ Ajaces, thus:"
11401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Now, brothers, be it dear to you, to fight and succour us,"
11402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As ever heretofore ye did, with men first excellent."
11403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The man lies slain that first did scale, and raze the battlement"
11404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That crown’d our wall, the Lycian prince. But if we now shall add"
11405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Force to his corse, and spoil his arms, a prise may more be had"
11406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of many great ones, that for him will put on to the death.”"
11407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To this work these were prompt enough; and each side ordereth
11408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Those phalanxes that most had rate of resolutions;
11409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Trojans and the Lycian pow’rs; the Greeks and Myrmidons.
11410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These ran together for the corse, and clos’d with horrid cries,"
11411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their armours thund’ring with the claps laid on about the prise.
11412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Jove, about th’ impetuous broil, pernicious night pour’d out,"
11413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As long as for his lovéd son, pernicious Labour fought."
11414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The first of Troy the first Greeks foil’d; when, not the last indeed"
11415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the Myrmidons, was slain, the great Agacleus’ seed,"
11416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Epigeus, that before had exercis’d command"
11417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In fair Budeiüs; but because he laid a bloody hand
11418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his own sister’s valiant son, to Peleus and his queen"
11419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He came for pardon, and obtain’d; his slaughter being the mean"
11420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He came to Troy, and so to this. He ventur’d ev’n to touch"
11421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The princely carcass; when a stone did more to him by much,"
11422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sent out of able Hector’s hand; it cut his skull in twain,"
11423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And strook him dead. Patroclus, griev’d to see his friend so slain,"
11424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before the foremost thrust himself. And as a falcon frays
11425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A flock of stares or caddesses; such fear brought his assays
11426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the Trojans and their friends; and, angry at the heart,"
11427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As well as griev’d, for him so slain, another stony dart"
11428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As good as Hector’s he let fly, that dusted in the neck"
11429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Sthenelaus, thrust his head to earth first, and did break"
11430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The nerves in sunder with his fall; off fell the Trojans too,"
11431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n Hector’s self, and all as far as any man can throw"
11432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Provok’d for games, or in the wars to shed an enemy’s soul)"
11433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A light long dart. The first that turn’d, was he that did control"
11434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The targeteers of Lycia, prince Glaucus; who to hell"
11435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sent Bathyclæus, Chalcon’s son; he did in Hellas dwell,"
11436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And shin’d for wealth and happiness amongst the Myrmidons;
11437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His bosom’s midst the jav’lin strook, his fall gat earth with groans."
11438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks griev’d, and the Trojans joy’d, for so renown’d a man;"
11439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About whom stood the Grecians firm. And then the death began
11440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On Troy’s side by Meriones; he slew one great in war,"
11441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laogonus, Onetor’s son, the priest of Jupiter,"
11442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Created in th’ Idæan hill. Betwixt his jaw and ear
11443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The dart stuck fast, and loos’d his soul; sad mists of hate and fear"
11444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Invading him. Anchises’ son despatch’d a brazen lance
11445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At bold Meriones; and hop’d to make an equal chance
11446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On him with bold Laogonus, though under his broad shield"
11447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He lay so close. But he discern’d, and made his body yield"
11448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So low, that over him it flew, and trembling took the ground,"
11449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With which Mars made it quench his thirst; and since the head could
11450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,wound
11451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No better body, and yet thrown from ne’er the worse a hand,"
11452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It turn’d from earth, and look’d awry. Æneas let it stand,"
11453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much angry at the vain event, and told Meriones"
11454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He scap’d but hardly, nor had cause to hope for such success"
11455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Another time, though well he knew his dancing faculty,"
11456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By whose agility he scap’d; for, had his dart gone by"
11457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any least touch, instantly he had been ever slain."
11458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: “Though thy strength be good, it cannot render vain"
11459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The strength of others with thy jests; nor art thou so divine,"
11460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when my lance shall touch at thee, with equal speed to thine,"
11461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Death will share with it thy life’s pow’rs; thy confidence can shun
11462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No more than mine what his right claims.” Menœtius’ noble son
11463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rebuk’d Meriones, and said: “What need’st thou use this speech?"
11464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor thy strength is approv’d with words, good friend, nor can we reach"
11465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The body, nor make th’ enemy yield, with these our counterbraves."
11466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We must enforce the binding earth, to hold them in her graves."
11467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If you will war, fight. Will you speak? Give counsel Counsel, blows,"
11468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are th’ ends of wars and words. Talk here, the time in vain bestows.”"
11469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He said, and led; and, nothing less for any thing he said,"
11470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(His speech being season’d with such right) the worthy seconded.
11471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then, as in a sounding vale, near neighbour to a hill,"
11472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wood-fellers make a far-heard noise, with chopping, chopping still,"
11473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And laying on, on blocks and trees; so they on men laid load,"
11474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And beat like noises into air, both as they strook and trode."
11475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, past their noise, so full of blood, of dust, of darts, lay smit"
11476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Sarpedon, that a man must have an excellent wit"
11477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That could but know him, and might fail, so from his utmost head,"
11478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n to the low plants of his feet, his form was alteréd."
11479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All thrusting near it ev’ry way, as thick as flies in spring,"
11480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That in a sheep-cote, when new milk assembles them, make wing,"
11481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And buzz about the top-full pails. Nor ever was the eye
11482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Jove averted from the fight; he view’d, thought, ceaselessly"
11483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And diversly upon the death of great Achilles’ friend,"
11484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If Hector there, to wreak his son, should with his jav’lin end"
11485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His life, and force away his arms, or still augment the field;"
11486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He then concluded that the flight of much more soul should yield
11487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles’ good friend more renown, and that ev’n to their gates"
11488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He should drive Hector and his host; and so disanimates
11489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mind of Hector that he mounts his chariot, and takes Flight"
11490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up with him, tempting all to her; affirming his insight"
11491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Knew evidently that the beam of Jove’s all-ord’ring scoles
11492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was then in sinking on their side, surcharg’d with flocks of souls."
11493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then not the noble Lycians stay’d, but left their slaughter’d lord"
11494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst the corses’ common heap; for many more were pour’d
11495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About and on him, while Jove’s hand held out the bitter broil."
11496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now they spoil’d Sarpedon’s arms, and to the ships the spoil"
11497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was sent by Menœtiades. Then Jove thus charg’d the Sun:
11498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Haste, honour’d Phœbus, let no more Greek violence be done"
11499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To my Sarpedon; but his corse of all the sable blood
11500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And jav’lins purg’d; then carry him, far hence to some clear flood,"
11501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With whose waves wash, and then embalm each thorough-cleanséd limb"
11502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With our ambrosia; which perform’d, divine weeds put on him,"
11503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then to those swift mates and twins, sweet Sleep and Death, commit"
11504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His princely person, that with speed they both may carry it"
11505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To wealthy Lycia; where his friends and brothers will embrace,"
11506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And tomb it in some monument, as fits a prince’s place.”"
11507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then flew Apollo to the fight, from the Idalian hill,"
11508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At all parts putting into act his great Commander’s will;
11509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Drew all the darts, wash’d, balm’d the corse; which, deck’d with"
11510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"ornament,"
11511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Sleep and Death, those feather’d twins, he into Lycia sent."
11512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Patroclus then Automedon commands to give his steeds
11513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Large reins, and all way to the chace; so madly he exceeds"
11514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The strict commission of his friend; which had he kept had kept
11515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A black death from him. But Jove’s mind hath evermore outstept
11516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mind of man; who both affrights, and takes the victory"
11517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From any hardiest hand with ease; which he can justify,"
11518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though he himself commands him fight, as now he put this chace"
11519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Menœtiades’s mind. How much then weighs the grace,"
11520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus, that Jove gives thee now, in scoles put with thy death,"
11521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all these great and famous men the honourable breath!
11522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of which Adrestus first he slew, and next Autonous,"
11523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Epistora, and Perimus, Pylartes, Elasus,"
11524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Swift Menalippus, Molius; all these were overthrown"
11525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By him, and all else put in rout; and then proud Ilion"
11526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had stoop’d beneath his glorious hand, he rag’d so with his lance,"
11527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If Phœbus had not kept the tow’r, and help’d the Ilians,"
11528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sustaining ill thoughts ’gainst the prince. Thrice to the prominence
11529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Troy’s steep wall he bravely leap’d; thrice Phœbus thrust him
11530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"thence,"
11531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Objecting his all-dazzling shield, with his resistless hand;"
11532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But fourthly, when, like one of heav’n, he would have stirr’d his"
11533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"stand,"
11534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apollo threaten’d him, and said: “Cease, it exceeds thy fate,"
11535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forward, Patroclus, to expugn with thy bold lance this state;"
11536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor under great Achilles’ pow’rs, to thine superior far,"
11537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lies Troy’s grave ruin.” When he spake, Patroclus left that war,"
11538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Leap’d far back, and his anger shunn’d. Hector detain’d his horse"
11539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Within the Scæan port, in doubt to put his personal force"
11540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the rout, and turn their heads, or shun in Troy the storm."
11541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apollo, seeing his suspense, resum’d the goodly form"
11542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Hector’s uncle, Asius; the Phrygian Dymas’ son,"
11543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who near the deep Sangarius had habitation,"
11544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being brother to the Trojan queen. His shape Apollo took,"
11545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ask’d of Hector, why his spirit so clear the fight forsook?"
11546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Affirming ’twas unfit for him, and wish’d his forces were"
11547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As much above his, as they mov’d in an inferior sphere."
11548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He should, with shame to him, be gone; and so bade drive away"
11549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against Patroclus, to approve, if He that gave them day"
11550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would give the glory of his death to his preferréd lance.
11551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So left he him, and to the fight did his bright head advance,"
11552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mix’d with the multitude, and stirr’d foul tumult for the foe."
11553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then Hector bade Cebriones put on; himself let go
11554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All other Greeks within his reach, and only gave command"
11555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To front Patroclus. He at him; jump’d down; his strong left hand
11556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A jav’lin held, his right a stone, a marble sharp and such"
11557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As his large hand had pow’r to gripe, and gave it strength as much"
11558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As he could lie to; nor stood long, in fear of that huge man"
11559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That made against him, but full on with his huge stone he ran,"
11560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discharg’d, and drave it ’twixt the brows of bold Cebriones."
11561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor could the thick bone there prepar’d extenuate so th’ access,"
11562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But out it drave his broken eyes, which in the dust fell down,"
11563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And he div’d after; which conceit of diving took the son
11564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of old Menœtius, who thus play’d upon the other’s bane."
11565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O heav’ns! For truth, this Trojan was a passing active man!"
11566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With what exceeding ease he dives, as if at work he were"
11567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Within the fishy seas! This man alone would furnish cheer
11568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For twenty men, though ’twere a storm, to leap out of a sail,"
11569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And gather oysters for them all, he does it here as well,"
11570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And there are many such in Troy.” Thus jested he so near
11571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His own grave death; and then made in, to spoil the charioteer,"
11572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such a lion’s force and fate, as, often ruining"
11573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stalls of fat oxen, gets at length a mortal wound to sting"
11574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His soul out of that rav’nous breast, that was so insolent,"
11575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And so his life’s bliss proves his bane; so deadly confident
11576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wert thou, Patroclus, in pursuit of good Cebriones,"
11577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whose defence now Hector leap’d. The opposite address,"
11578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These masters of the cry in war now made, was of the kind"
11579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of two fierce kings of beasts, oppos’d in strife about a hind"
11580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Slain on the forehead of a hill, both sharp and hungry set"
11581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to the currie never came but like two deaths they met;
11582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor these two entertain’d less mind of mutual prejudice
11583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the body, close to which when each had press’d for prise,"
11584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hector the head laid hand upon, which, once grip’d, never could"
11585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be forc’d from him; Patroclus then upon the feet got hold,"
11586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he pinch’d with as sure a nail. So both stood tugging there,"
11587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While all the rest made eager fight, and grappled ev’ry where."
11588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as the east and south winds strive, to make a lofty wood"
11589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bow to their greatness, barky elms, wild ashes, beeches, bow’d"
11590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n with the earth, in whose thick arms the mighty vapours lie,"
11591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And toss by turns, all, either way, their leaves at random fly,"
11592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Boughs murmur, and their bodies crack, and with perpetual din"
11593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sylvans falter, and the storms are never to begin;"
11594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So rag’d the fight, and all from Flight pluck’d her forgotten wings,"
11595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While some still stuck, still new-wing’d shafts flew dancing from their"
11596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"strings,"
11597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Huge stones sent after that did shake the shields about the corse,"
11598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who now, in dust’s soft forehead stretch’d, forgat his guiding horse."
11599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As long as Phœbus turn’d his wheels about the midst of heaven,"
11600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So long the touch of either’s darts the falls of both made even;
11601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, when his wain drew near the west, the Greeks past measure were"
11602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The abler soldiers, and so swept the Trojan tumult clear"
11603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From off the body, out of which they drew the hurl’d-in darts,"
11604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And from his shoulders stripp’d his arms; and then to more such parts
11605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus turn’d his striving thoughts, to do the Trojans ill."
11606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrice, like the God of war, he charg’d, his voice as horrible,"
11607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thrice-nine those three charges slew; but in the fourth assay,"
11608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O then, Patroclus, show’d thy last; the dreadful Sun made way"
11609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against that onset; yet the prince discern’d no Deity,"
11610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He kept the press so, and, besides, obscur’d his glorious eye"
11611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such felt darkness. At his back, he made a sudden stand,"
11612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ’twixt his neck and shoulders laid down-right with either hand
11613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A blow so weighty, that his eyes a giddy darkness took,"
11614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And from his head his three-plum’d helm the bounding violence shook,"
11615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That rung beneath his horses’ hooves, and, like a water-spout,"
11616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was crush’d together with the fall; the plumes that set it out,"
11617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All spatter’d with black blood and dust; when ever heretofore
11618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It was a capital offence to have or dust or gore
11619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Defile a triple-feather’d helm, but on the head divine"
11620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And youthful temples of their prince it us’d, untouch’d, to shine."
11621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet now Jove gave it Hector’s hands, the other’s death was near."
11622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides whose lost and filéd helm his huge long weighty spear,"
11623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Well-bound with iron, in his hand was shiver’d, and his shield"
11624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fell from his shoulders to his feet, the bawdrick strewing the field;"
11625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His curets left him, like the rest. And all this only done"
11626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By great Apollo. Then his mind took in confusion,"
11627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The vig’rous knittings of his joints dissolv’d; and, thus dismay’d,"
11628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A Dardan, one of Panthus’ sons, and one that overlaid"
11629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All Trojans of his place with darts, swift footing, skill, and force"
11630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In noble horsemanship, and one that tumbled from their horse,"
11631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One after other, twenty men, and when he did but learn"
11632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The art of war; nay when he first did in the field discern

11641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Came close up to him, and both sides strook quite through with his"

11643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He fell, and his most weighty fall gave fit tune to his chance;"
11644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For which all Greece extremely mourn’d. And as a mighty strife
11645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About a little fount begins, and riseth to the life"
11646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of some fell boar resolv’d to drink; when likewise to the spring
11647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A lion comes alike dispos’d, the boar thirsts, and his king,"

11651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When he had forc’d so much brave life, was from his own divorc’d."
11652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus his great divorcer brav’d: “Patroclus, thy conceit"
11653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gave thee th’ eversion of our Troy, and to thy fleet a freight"
11654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Trojan ladies, their free lives put all in bands by thee;"
11655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But (too much prizer of thy self) all these are propp’d by me,"
11656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For these have my horse stretch’d their hoofs to this so long a war,"
11657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And I (far best of Troy in arms) keep off from Troy as far,"
11658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n to the last beam of my life, their necessary day."
11659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And here, in place of us and ours, on thee shall vultures prey,"
11660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Poor wretch; nor shall thy mighty friend afford thee any aid,"
11661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That gave thy parting much deep charge, and this perhaps be said:"
11662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Martial Patroclus, turn not face, nor see my fleet before"
11663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The curets from great Hector’s breast, all gilded with his gore,"
11664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou hew’st in pieces.’ If thus vain were his far-stretched commands,"
11665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As vain was thy heart to believe his words lay in thy hands.”
11666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, languishing, replied: “This proves, thy glory worse than vain,"
11667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That when two Gods have giv’n thy hands what their pow’rs did obtain,"
11668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(They conqu’ring, and they spoiling me both of my arms and mind,"
11669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It being a work of ease for them) thy soul should be so blind
11670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To oversee their evident deeds, and take their pow’rs to thee;"
11671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, if the pow’rs of twenty such had dar’d t’ encounter me,"
11672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My lance had strew’d earth with them all. Thou only dost obtain
11673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A third place in my death; whom, first, a harmful hate hath slain"
11674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Effected by Latona’s son; second, and first of men,"
11675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Euphorbus. And this one thing more concerns thee; note it then;
11676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou shalt not long survive thyself; nay, now death calls for thee,"
11677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And violent fate; Achilles’ lance shall make this good for me.”
11678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus death join’d to his words his end; his soul took instant wing,"

11776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He slain, the king stripp’d off his arms; and with their worthy prise,"
11777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All fearing him, had clearly pass’d, if heaven’s fair Eye of eyes"
11778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had not, in envy of his acts, to his encounter stirr’d"
11779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Mars-like Hector; to whose pow’rs the rescue he preferr’d
11780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of those fair arms, and took the shape of Mentas, colonel"
11781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the Cicones that near the Thracian Hebrus dwell.
11782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like him, he thus puts forth his voice: “Hector, thou scour’st the"

11785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To take the draught of chariots, by any mortal’s hand;"
11786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The great grandchild of Æacus hath only their command,"
11787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom an immortal mother bore. While thou attend’st on these,"
11788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The young Atrides, in defence of Menœtiades,"
11789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hath slain Euphorbus.” Thus the God took troop with men again;
11790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Hector, heartily perplex’d, look’d round, and saw the slain"
11791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Still shedding rivers from his wound; and then took envious view
11792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of brave Atrides with his spoil; in way to whom he flew
11793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Like one of Vulcan’s quenchless flames. Atrides heard the cry
11794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That ever usher’d him, and sigh’d, and said: “O me, if I[2]"
11795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should leave these goodly arms, and him, that here lies dead for me,"
11796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I fear I should offend the Greeks; if I should stay and be
11797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Alone with Hector and his men, I may be compass’d in,"
11798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some sleight or other they may use, many may quickly win"
11799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their wills of one, and all Troy comes ever where Hector leads."
11800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But why, dear mind, dost thou thus talk? When men dare set their heads"
11801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the Gods, as sure they do that fight with men they love,"
11802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Straight one or other plague ensues. It cannot therefore move
11803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The grudge of any Greek that sees I yield to Hector, he"
11804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Still fighting with a spirit from heav’n. And yet if I could see
11805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brave Ajax, he and I would stand, though ’gainst a God; and sure"
11806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Tis best I seek him, and then see if we two can procure"
11807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This corse’s freedom through all these. A little then let rest
11808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The body, and my mind be still. Of two bads choose the best.”"
11809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this discourse, the troops of Troy were in with him, and he"
11810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made such a lion-like retreat, as when the herdsmen see"
11811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The royal savage, and come on, with men, dogs, cries, and spears,"
11812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To clear their hornéd stall, and then the kingly heart he bears"
11813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(With all his high disdain) falls off; so from this odds of aid
11814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The golden-hair’d Atrides fled, and in his strength display’d"
11815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon his left hand him he wish’d, extremely busiéd"
11816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About encouraging his men, to whom an extreme dread"
11817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apollo had infus’d. The king reach’d Ajax instantly,"
11818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “Come, friend, let us two haste, and from the tyranny"
11819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Hector free Patroclus’ corse.” He straight and gladly went;
11820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then was Hector haling off the body, with intent"
11821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To spoil the shoulders of the dead, and give the dogs the rest,"
11822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His arms he having pris’d before; when Ajax brought his breast
11823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To bar all further spoil. With that he had, sure Hector thought"
11824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,‘Twas best to satisfy his spleen; which temper Ajax wrought
11825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his mere sight, and Hector fled. The arms he sent to Troy,"
11826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make his citizens admire, and pray Jove send him joy."
11827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Ajax gather’d to the corse, and hid it with his targe,"
11828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There setting down as sure a foot, as, in the tender charge"
11829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his lov’d whelps, a lion doth; two hundred hunters near"
11830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To give him onset, their more force makes him the more austere,"
11831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Drowns all their clamours in his roars, darts, dogs, doth all despise,"
11832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And lets his rough brows down so low, they cover all his eyes;"
11833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So Ajax look’d, and stood, and stay’d for great Priamides."
11834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When Glaucus Hippolochides saw Ajax thus depress
11835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The spirit of Hector, thus he chid: “O goodly man at arms,"
11836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In fight a Paris, why should fame make thee fort ’gainst our harms,"
11837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being such a fugitive? Now mark, how well thy boasts defend"
11838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy city only with her own. Be sure it shall descend
11839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To that proof wholly. Not a man of any Lycian rank
11840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shall strike one stroke more for thy town; for no man gets a thank
11841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should he eternally fight here, nor any guard of thee."
11842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How wilt thou, worthless that thou art, keep off an enemy"
11843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From our poor soldiers, when their prince, Sarpedon, guest and friend"
11844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thee, and most deservedly, thou flew’st from in his end,"
11845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And left’st to all the lust of Greece? O Gods, a man that was"
11846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(In life) so huge a good to Troy, and to thee such a grace,"
11847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(In death) not kept by thee from dogs! If my friends will do well,"
11848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We’ll take our shoulders from your walls, and let all sink to hell;"
11849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As all will, were our faces turn’d. Did such a spirit breathe"
11850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all you Trojans, as becomes all men that fight beneath"
11851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their country’s standard, you would see, that such a prop your cause"
11852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With like exposure of their lives, have all the honour’d laws"
11853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of such a dear confederacy kept to them to a thread,"
11854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As now ye might reprise the arms Sarpedon forfeited
11855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By forfeit of your rights to him, would you but lend your hands,"
11856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And force Patroclus to your Troy. Ye know how dear he stands
11857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his love, that of all the Greeks is, for himself, far best,"
11858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And leads the best near-fighting men; and therefore would at least
11859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Redeem Sarpedon’s arms; nay him, whom you have likewise lost."
11860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This body drawn to Ilion would after draw and cost
11861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A greater ransom if you pleas’d; but Ajax startles you;
11862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,’Tis his breast bars this right to us; his looks are darts enow
11863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To mix great Hector with his men. And not to blame ye are,"
11864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You choose foes underneath your strengths, Ajax exceeds ye far.”"
11865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hector look’d passing sour at this, and answer’d: “Why dar’st thou,"
11866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So under, talk above me so? O friend, I thought till now"
11867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy wisdom was superior to all th’ inhabitants
11868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of gleby Lycia; but now impute apparent wants
11869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To that discretion thy words show, to say I lost my ground"
11870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Ajax’ greatness. Nor fear I the field in combats drown’d,"
11871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor force of chariots, but I fear a Pow’r much better seen"
11872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In right of all war than all we. That God, that holds between"
11873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our victory and us his shield, lets conquest come and go"
11874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At his free pleasure, and with fear converts her changes so"
11875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon the strongest. Men must fight when his just spirit impels,"
11876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not their vain glories. But come on, make thy steps parallels"
11877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To these of mine, and then be judge, how deep the work will draw."
11878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If then I spend the day in shifts, or thou canst give such law"
11879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thy detractive speeches then, or if the Grecian host"
11880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Holds any that in pride of strength holds up his spirit most,"
11881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom, for the carriage of this prince, that thou enforcest so,"
11882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I make not stoop in his defence. You, friends, ye hear and know"
11883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How much it fits ye to make good this Grecian I have slain,"
11884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For ransom of Jove’s son, our friend. Play then the worthy men,"
11885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till I indue Achilles’ arms.” This said, he left the fight,"
11886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And call’d back those that bore the arms, not yet without his sight,"
11887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In convoy of them towards Troy. For them he chang’d his own,"
11888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Remov’d from where it rained tears, and sent them back to town."
11889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then put he on th’ eternal arms, that the Celestial States"
11890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gave Peleus; Peleus, being old, their use appropriates"
11891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his Achilles, that, like him, forsook them not for age."
11892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When He, whose empire is in clouds, saw Hector bent to wage"
11893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"War in divine Achilles’ arms, he shook his head, and said:"
11894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Poor wretch, thy thoughts are far from death, though he so near hath"
11895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,laid
11896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ambush for thee. Thou putt’st on those arms, as braving him"
11897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom others fear; hast slain his friend, and from his youthful limb"
11898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Torn rudely off his heav’nly arms, himself being gentle, kind,"
11899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And valiant. Equal measure then, thy life in youth must find."
11900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet since the justice is so strict, that not Andromache,"
11901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In thy denied return from fight, must ever take of thee"
11902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those arms, in glory of thy acts; thou shalt have that frail blaze"
11903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of excellence that neighbours death, a strength ev’n to amaze.”"
11904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To this His sable brows did bow; and he made fit his limb
11905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To those great arms, to fill which up the War-god enter’d him"
11906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Austere and terrible, his joints and ev’ry part extends"
11907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With strength and fortitude; and thus to his admiring friends
11908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"High Clamour brought him. He so shin’d, that all could think no less"
11909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But he resembled ev’ry way great-soul’d Æacides.
11910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then ev’ry way he scour’d the field, his captains calling on;"
11911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Asteropæus, Eunomus, that foresaw all things done,"
11912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Glaucus, and Medon, Desinor, and strong Thersilochus,"
11913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Phorcis, and Mesthles, Chromius, and great Hippothous;"
11914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all these, and their populous troops, these his excitements were:"
11915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Hear us, innumerable friends, near-bord’ring nations, hear."
11916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We have not call’d you from our towns, to fill our idle eye"
11917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With number of so many men (no such vain empery
11918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did ever joy us) but to fight; and of our Trojan wives,"
11919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all their children, manfully to save the innocent lives."
11920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In whose cares we draw all our towns of aiding soldiers dry,"
11921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With gifts, guards, victual, all things fit; and hearten their  supply"
11922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all like rights; and therefore now let all sides set down this,"
11923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or live, or perish; this of war the special secret is."
11924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which most resolute design, whoever bears to town"
11925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus, laid dead to his hand, by winning the renown"
11926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Ajax’ slaughter, the half-spoil we wholly will impart"
11927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his free use, and to ourself the other half convert;"
11928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so the glory shall be shar’d, ourself will have no more"
11929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then he shall shine in.” This drew all to bring abroad their store
11930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before the body. Ev’ry man had hope it would be his,"
11931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And forc’d from Ajax. Silly fools, Ajax prevented this"
11932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By raising rampires to his friend with half their carcasses.
11933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet his humour was to roar, and fear, and now no less"
11934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To startle Sparta’s king, to whom he cried out: “O my friend!"
11935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,O Menelaus! Now no hope to get off; here’s the end
11936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all our labours. Not so much I fear to lose the corse
11937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(For that’s sure gone, the fowls of Troy and dogs will quickly force"
11938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That piece-meal) as I fear my head, and thine, O Atreus’ son."
11939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hector a cloud brings will hide all. Instant destructión,"
11940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grievous and heavy, comes. O call our peers to aid us; fly.”"
11941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He hasted, and us’d all his voice, sent far and near his cry:"
11942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O princes, chief lights of the Greeks, and you that publicly"
11943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eat with our General and me, all men of charge, O know"
11944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Jove gives both grace and dignity to any that will show
11945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good minds for only good itself, though presently the eye"
11946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of him that rules discern him not. ’Tis hard for me t’espy,"
11947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through all this smoke of burning fight, each captain in his place,"
11948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And call assistance to our need. Be then each other’s grace,"
11949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And freely follow each his next. Disdain to let the joy
11950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of great Æacides be forc’d to feed the beasts of Troy.”
11951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His voice was first heard and obey’d by swift Oïliades;
11952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Idomenëus and his mate, renown’d Meriones,"
11953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were seconds to Oïleus’ son; but, of the rest, whose mind"
11954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Can lay upon his voice the names, that after these combin’d"
11955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In setting up this fight on end? The Trojans first gave on.
11956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as into the sea’s vast mouth, when mighty rivers run,"
11957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their billows and the sea resound, and all the utter shore"
11958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rebellows in her angry shocks the sea’s repulsive roar;
11959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such sounds gave the Trojans charge, so was their charge"
11960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,repress’d.
11961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One mind fill’d all Greeks, good brass shields close couch’d to ev’ry"
11962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"breast,"
11963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And on their bright helms Jove pour’d down a mighty deal of night,"
11964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To hide Patroclus; whom alive, and when he was the knight"
11965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of that grandchild of Æacus, Saturnius did not hate,"
11966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor dead would see him dealt to dogs, and so did instigate"
11967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His fellows to his worthy guard. At first the Trojans drave
11968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The black-ey’d Grecians from the corse; but not a blow they gave
11969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That came at death. Awhile they hung about the body’s heels,"
11970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks quite gone. But all that while, did Ajax whet the steels"
11971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all his forces, that cut back way to the corse again."
11972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brave Ajax (that for form and fact, pass’d all that did maintain"
11973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Grecian fame, next Thetis’ son) now flew before the first."
11974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And as a sort of dogs and youths are by a boar disperst
11975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About a mountain; so fled these from mighty Ajax, all"
11976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That stood in conflict for the corse, who thought no chance could fall"
11977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Betwixt them and the prise at Troy; for both Hippothous,"
11978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lethus’ Pelasgus’ famous son, was so adventurous"
11979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That he would stand to bore the corse about the ancle-bone,"
11980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where all the nervy fibres meet and ligaments in one,"
11981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That make the motion of those parts; through which he did convey
11982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The thong or bawdric of his shield, and so was drawing away"
11983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All thanks from Hector and his friends; but in their stead he drew
11984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,An ill that no man could avert; for Telamonius threw
11985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A lance that strook quite through his helm, his brain came leaping out;"
11986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down fell Letheides, and with him the body’s hoisted foot."
11987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Far from Larissa’s soil he fell; a little time allow’d
11988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To his industrious spirits to quit the benefits bestow’d
11989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By his kind parents. But his wreak Priamides assay’d,"
11990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And threw at Ajax; but his dart, discover’d, pass’d, and stay’d"
11991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At Schedius, son of Iphitus, a man of ablest hand"
11992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the strong Phocensians, and liv’d with great command"
11993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Panopëus. The fell dart fell through his channel-bone,"
11994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pierc’d through his shoulder’s upper part, and set his spirit gone."
11995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When after his another flew, the same hand giving wing"
11996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To martial Phorcis’ startled soul, that was the after spring"
11997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Phænops’ seed. The jav’lin strook his curets through, and tore"
11998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The bowels from the belly’s midst. His fall made those before
11999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Give back a little, Hector’s self enforc’d to turn his face."
12000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then the Greeks bestow’d their shouts, took vantage of the chace,"
12001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Drew off, and spoil’d Hippothous and Phorcis of their arms."
12002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then ascended Ilion had shaken with alarms,"
12003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discov’ring th’ impotence of Troy, ev’n past the will of Jove,"
12004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And by the proper force of Greece, had Phœbus fail’d to move"
12005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Æneas in similitude of Periphas (the son
12006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of grave Epytes) king at arms, and had good service done"
12007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To old Anchises, being wise, and ev’n with him in years."
12008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, like this man, the far-seen God to Venus’ son appears,"
12009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ask’d him how he would maintain steep Ilion in her height,"
12010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In spite of Gods, as he presum’d; when men approv’d so slight"
12011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All his presumptions, and all theirs that puff’d him with that pride,"
12012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Believing in their proper strengths, and gen’rally supplied"
12013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such unfrighted multitudes? But he well knew that Jove,"
12014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides their self-conceits, sustain’d their forces with more love"
12015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Than theirs of Greece; and yet all that lack’d pow’r to hearten them.
12016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Æneas knew the God, and said: “It was a shame extreme,"
12017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That those of Greece should beat them so, and by their cowardice,"
12018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not want of man’s aid nor the Gods’; and this before his eyes
12019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A Deity stood ev’n now and vouch’d, affirming Jove their aid;"
12020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so bade Hector and the rest, to whom all this he said,"
12021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Turn head, and not in that quick ease part with the corse to Greece.”"
12022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, before them all he flew, and all as of a piece"
12023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the Greeks flew. Venus’ son Leocritus did end,"
12024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Son of Arisbas, and had place of Lycomedes’ friend;"
12025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose fall he friendly pitied, and, in revenge, bestow’d"
12026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A lance that Apisaon strook, so sore that straight he strow’d"
12027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The dusty centre, it did stick in that congealéd blood"
12028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That forms the liver. Second man he was of all that stood
12029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In name for arms amongst the troop that from Pæonia came,"
12030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Asteropæus being the first; who was in ruth the same
12031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Lycomedes was; like whom, he put forth for the wreak"
12032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his slain friend; but wrought it not, because he could not break"
12033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That bulwark made of Grecian shields, and bristled wood of spears,"
12034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Combin’d about the body slain. Amongst whom Ajax bears
12035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The greatest labour, ev’ry way exhorting to abide,"
12036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And no man fly the corse a foot, nor break their ranks in pride"
12037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of any foremost daring spirit, but each foot hold his stand,"
12038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And use the closest fight they could. And this was the command
12039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of mighty Ajax; which observ’d, they steep’d the earth in blood."
12040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Trojans and their friends fell thick. Nor all the Grecians stood
12041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Though far the fewer suffer’d fate) for ever they had care
12042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To shun confusion, and the toil that still oppresseth there."
12043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So set they all the field on fire; with which you would have thought
12044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sun and moon had been put out, in such a smoke they fought"
12045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About the person of the prince. But all the field beside
12046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fought underneath a lightsome heav’n; the sun was in his pride,"
12047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And such expansure of his beams he thrust out of his throne,"
12048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That not a vapour durst appear in all that region,"
12049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No, not upon the highest hill. There fought they still, and breath’d,"
12050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shunn’d danger, cast their darts aloof, and not a sword unsheath’d."
12051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The other plied it, and the war and night plied them as well,"
12052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The cruel steel afflicting all; the strongest did not dwell
12053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Unhurt within their iron roofs. Two men of special name.
12054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antilochus and Thrasymed, were yet unserv’d by Fame"
12055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With notice of Patroclus’ death. They thought him still alive
12056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In foremost tumult, and might well, for (seeing their fellows thrive"
12057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In no more comfortable sort than fight and death would yield)
12058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They fought apart; for so their sire, old Nestor, strictly will’d,"
12059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Enjoining fight more from the fleet. War here increas’d his heat
12060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The whole day long, continually the labour and the sweat"
12061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The knees, calves, feet, hands, faces, smear’d, of men that Mars"
12062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,applied
12063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About the good Achilles’ friend. And as a huge ox-hide[3]
12064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A currier gives amongst his men, to supple and extend"
12065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With oil till it be drunk withall; they tug, stretch out, and spend"
12066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their oil and liquor lib’rally, and chafe the leather so"
12067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That out they make a vapour breathe, and in their oil doth go,"
12068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A number of them set on work, and in an orb they pull,"
12069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That all ways all parts of the hide they may extend at full;
12070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So here and there did both parts hale the corse in little place,"
12071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And wrought it all ways with their sweat; the Trojans hop’d for grace
12072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make it reach to Ilion, the Grecians to their fleet,"
12073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A cruel tumult they stirr’d up, and such as should Mars see’t"
12074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(That horrid hurrier of men) or She that betters him,"
12075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva, never so incens’d, they could not disesteem."
12076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So baneful a contention did Jove that day extend
12077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of men and horse about the slain. Of whom his god-like friend
12078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had no instruction, so far off, and underneath the wall"
12079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Troy, that conflict was maintain’d; which was not thought at all"
12080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By great Achilles, since he charg’d, that having set his foot"
12081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon the ports, he would retire, well knowing Troy no boot"
12082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For his assaults without himself, since not by him as well"
12083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He knew it was to be subdu’d. His mother oft would tell
12084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mind of mighty Jove therein, oft hearing it in heav’n;"
12085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But of that great ill to his friend was no instruction giv’n
12086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By careful Thetis. By degrees must ill events be known.
12087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The foes cleft one to other still, about the overthrown."
12088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His death with death infected both. Ev’n private Greeks would say
12089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Either to other: “’Twere a shame, for us to go our way,"
12090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And let the Trojans bear to Troy the praise of such a prise!
12091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, let the black earth gasp, and drink our blood for sacrifice,"
12092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before we suffer. ’Tis an act much less infortunate,"
12093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then would those of Troy resolve, though certainly our fate"
12094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will fell us altogether here. Of all not turn a face.”
12095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus either side his fellows’ strength excited past his place,"
12096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus through all th’ unfruitful air, an iron sound ascended"
12097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up to the golden firmament; when strange affects contended
12098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In these immortal heav’n-bred horse of great Æacides,"
12099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom (once remov’d from forth the fight) a sudden sense did seize
12100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of good Patroclus’ death, whose hands they oft had undergone,"
12101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And bitterly they wept for him. Nor could Automedon
12102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any manage make them stir, oft use the scourge to them,"
12103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Oft use his fairest speech, as oft threats never so extreme,"
12104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They neither to the Hellespont would bear him, nor the fight;"
12105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But still as any tombstone lays his never stirréd weight
12106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On some good man or woman’s grave for rites of funeral;
12107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So unremovéd stood these steeds, their heads to earth let fall,"
12108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And warm tears gushing from their eyes, with passionate desire"
12109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of their kind manager; their manes, that flourish’d with the fire"
12110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of endless youth allotted them, fell through the yoky sphere,"
12111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ruthfully ruffled and defil’d, Jove saw their heavy cheer,"
12112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, pitying them, spake to his mind: “Poor wretched beasts,” said he,"
12113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Why gave we you t’ a mortal king, when immortality"
12114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And incapacity of age so dignifies your states?
12115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was it to haste the miseries pour’d out on human fates?
12116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the miserablest things that breathe and creep on earth,"
12117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No one more wretched is than man. And for your deathless birth,"
12118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hector must fail to make you prise. Is’t not enough he wears,"
12119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And glories vainly in those arms? Your chariots and rich gears,"
12120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides you, are too much for him. Your knees and spirits again"
12121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My care of you shall fill with strength, that so ye may sustain"
12122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Automedon, and bear him off. To Troy I still will give"
12123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The grace of slaughter, till at fleet their bloody feet arrive,"
12124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till Phœbus drink the western sea, and sacred Darkness throws"
12125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her sable mantle ’twixt their points.” Thus in the steeds he blows
12126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Excessive spirit; and through the Greeks and Ilians they rapt
12127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The whirring chariot, shaking off the crumbled centre wrapt"
12128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst their tresses. And with them, Automedon let fly"
12129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the Trojans, making way through all as frightfully"
12130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As through a jangling flock of geese a lordly vulture beats,"
12131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Giv’n way with shrikes by ev’ry goose, that comes but near his threats;"
12132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such state fled he through the press, pursuing as he fled;"
12133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But made no slaughter; nor he could, alone being carried"
12134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon the sacred chariot. How could he both works do,"
12135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Direct his jav’lin, and command his fi’ry horses too?"
12136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At length he came where he beheld his friend Alcimedon,"
12137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That was the good Laercius’, the son of Æmon’s, son;"
12138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who close came to his chariot side, and ask’d: “What God is he"
12139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That hath so robb’d thee of thy soul, to run thus franticly"
12140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst these fore fights, being alone; thy fighter being slain,"
12141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And Hector glorying in his arms?” He gave these words again:
12142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Alcimedon, what man is he, of all the Argive race,"
12143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So able as thyself to keep, in use of press and pace,"
12144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These deathless horse; himself being gone, that like the Gods had th’"
12145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,art
12146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of their high manage? Therefore take to thy command his part,"
12147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ease me of the double charge, which thou hast blam’d with right.”"
12148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took the scourge and reins in hand, Automedon the fight."
12149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which Hector seeing, instantly, Æneas standing near,"
12150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He told him, he discern’d the horse, that mere immortal were,"
12151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Address’d to fight with coward guides, and therefore hop’d to make"
12152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A rich prise of them, if his mind would help to undertake,"
12153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For those two could not stand their charge. He granted, and both cast"
12154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dry solid hides upon their necks, exceeding soundly brast;"
12155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And forth they went, associate with two more god-like men,"
12156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Aretus and bold Chromius; nor made they question then
12157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To prise the goodly-crested horse, and safely send to hell"
12158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The souls of both their guardians. O fools, that could not tell"
12159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They could not work out their return from fierce Automedon
12160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Without the lib’ral cost of blood; who first made orison
12161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To father Jove, and then was fill’d with fortitude and strength;"
12162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When (counselling Alcimedon to keep at no great length
12163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The horse from him, but let them breathe upon his back, because"
12164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He saw th’ advance that Hector made, whose fury had no laws"
12165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Propos’d to it, but both their lives and those horse made his prise,"
12166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or his life theirs) he call’d to friend these well-approv’d supplies,"
12167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ Ajaces, and the Spartan king, and said, “Come, princes, leave"
12168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A sure guard with the corse, and then to your kind care receive"
12169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our threaten’d safeties. I discern the two chief props of Troy
12170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prepar’d against us. But herein, what best men can enjoy"
12171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Lies in the free knees of the Gods. My dart shall lead ye all[4]
12172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sequel to the care of Jove I leave, whatever fall.”"
12173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All this spake good Automedon; then, brandishing his lance,"
12174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He threw, and strook Aretus’ shield, that gave it enterance"
12175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through all the steel, and, by his belt, his belly’s inmost part"
12176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It pierc’d, and all his trembling limbs gave life up to his dart."
12177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Hector at Automedon a blazing lance let fly,"
12178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose flight he saw, and falling flat, the compass was too high,"
12179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And made it stick beyond in earth, th’ extreme part burst, and there"
12180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Mars buried all his violence. The sword then for the spear
12181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had chang’d the conflict, had not haste sent both th’ Ajaces in,"
12182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both serving close their fellows’ call, who, where they did begin,"
12183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There drew the end. Priamides, Æneas, Chromius"
12184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(In doubt of what such aid might work) left broken hearted thus
12185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aretus to Automedon, who spoil’d his arms, and said:"
12186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“A little this revives my life for him so lately dead,"
12187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though by this nothing countervail’d.” And with this little vent
12188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of inward grief, he took the spoil; with which he made ascent"
12189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to his chariot, hands and feet of bloody stains so full"
12190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That lion-like he look’d, new turn’d from tearing up a bull."
12191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now another bitter fight about Patroclus grew,"
12192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tear-thirsty, and of toil enough; which Pallas did renew,"
12193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Descending from the cope of stars, dismiss’d by sharp-ey’d Jove"
12194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To animate the Greeks; for now, inconstant change did move"
12195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His mind from what he held of late. And as the purple bow
12196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove bends at mortals, when of war he will the signal show,"
12197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or make it a presage of cold, in such tempestuous sort"
12198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That men are of their labours eas’d, but labouring cattle hurt;"
12199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So Pallas in a purple cloud involv’d herself, and went"
12200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the Grecians, stirr’d up all; but first encouragement"
12201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She breath’d in Atreus’ younger son, and, for disguise, made choice"
12202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of aged Phœnix’ shape, and spake with his unwearied voice:"
12203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Menelaus, much defame, and equal heaviness,"
12204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will touch at thee, if this true friend of great Æacides"
12205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Dogs tear beneath the Trojan walls; and therefore bear thee well.
12206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Toil through the host, and ev’ry man with all thy spirit impell.”"
12207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: “O thou long-since born, O Phœnix, that hast won"
12208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The honour’d foster-father’s name of Thetis’ god-like son,"
12209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I would Minerva would but give strength to me, and but keep"
12210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These busy darts off; I would then make in indeed, and steep"
12211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My income in their bloods, in aid of good Patroclus; much"
12212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His death afflicts me, much. But yet, this Hector’s grace is such"
12213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With Jove, and such a fi’ry strength and spirit he has, that still"
12214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His steel is killing, killing still.” The king’s so royal will"
12215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva joy’d to hear, since she did all the Gods outgo"
12216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In his remembrance. For which grace she kindly did bestow
12217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strength on his shoulders, and did fill his knees as lib’rally"
12218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With swiftness, breathing in his breast the courage of a fly,"
12219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which loves to bite so, and doth bear man’s blood so much good will,"
12220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That still though beaten from a man she flies upon him still;
12221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such a courage Pallas fill’d the black parts near his heart,"
12222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then he hasted to the slain, cast off a shining dart,"
12223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And took one Podes, that was heir to old Eetion,"
12224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A rich man and a strenuous, and by the people done"
12225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much honour, and by Hector too, being consort and his guest;"
12226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And him the yellow-headed king laid hold on at his waist
12227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In off’ring flight, his iron pile strook through him, down he fell,"
12228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And up Atrides drew his corse. Then Phœbus did impell
12229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The spirit of Hector, Phænops like, surnam’d Asiades,"
12230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom Hector us’d, of all his guests, with greatest friendliness,"
12231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And in Abydus stood his house; in whose form thus he spake:
12232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“Hector! What man of all the Greeks will any terror make
12233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of meeting thy strength any more, when thou art terrified"
12234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Menelaus, who, before he slew thy friend, was tried"
12235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A passing easy soldier, where now (besides his end"
12236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Impos’d by him) he draws him off, and not a man to friend."
12237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From all the Trojans? This friend is Podes, Eetion’s son.”"
12238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This hid him in a cloud of grief, and set him foremost on."
12239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then Jove took his snake-fring’d shield, and Ida cover’d all"
12240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With sulphury clouds, from whence he let abhorréd lightnings fall,"
12241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thunder’d till the mountains shook; and with this dreadful state
12242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He usher’d victory to Troy, to Argos flight and fate."
12243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Peneleüs Bœotius was he that foremost fled,"
12244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Being wounded in his shoulder’s height; but there the lance’s head
12245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strook lightly, glancing to his mouth, because it strook him near,"
12246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thrown from Polydamas. Leitus next left the fight in fear
12247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Being hurt by Hector in his hand) because he doubted sore
12248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His hand in wishéd fight with Troy would hold his lance no more.
12249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Idomenëus sent a dart at Hector (rushing in,"
12250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And following Leitus) that strook his bosom near his chin,"
12251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And brake at top. The Ilians for his escape did shout.
12252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Hector at Deucalides another lance sent out,"
12253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As in his chariot he stood; it miss’d him narrowly,"
12254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For, as it fell, Cœranus drave his speedy chariot by,"
12255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And took the Trojan lance himself; he was the charioteer
12256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of stern Meriones, and first on foot did service there,"
12257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which well he left to govern horse, for saving now his king,"
12258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With driving ’twixt him and his death, though thence his own did"
12259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"spring,"
12260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which kept a mighty victory from Troy, in keeping death"
12261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From his great sov’reign. The fierce dart did enter him beneath
12262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ear, betwixt his jaw and it, drave down, cut through his tongue,"
12263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And strook his teeth out; from his hands the horses’ reins he flung,"
12264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which now Meriones receiv’d as they bestrew’d the field,"
12265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bade his sov’reign scourge away, he saw that day would yield"
12266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No hope of victory for them. He fear’d the same, and fled."
12267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor from the mighty-minded son of Telamon lay hid,"
12268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For all his clouds, high Jove himself, nor from the Spartan king."
12269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They saw Him in the victory, He still was varying"
12270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Troy. For which sight Ajax said: “O heav’ns, what fool is he"
12271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That sees not Jove’s hand in the grace now done our enemy?
12272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not any dart they touch but takes, from whomsoever thrown,"
12273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Valiant or coward; what he wants Jove adds, not any one"
12274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wants his direction to strike sure; nor ours to miss as sure.
12275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But come, let us be sure of this, to put the best in ure"
12276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That lies in us; which two-fold is, both to fetch off our friend,"
12277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And so to fetch him off as we may likeliest contend
12278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To fetch ourselves off; that our friends surviving may have right
12279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In joy of our secure retreat, as he that fell in fight,"
12280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being kept as sure from further wrong. Of which perhaps they doubt,"
12281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And looking this way, grieve for us, not able to work out"
12282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our pass from this man-slaughterer, great Hector, and his hands"
12283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That are too hot for men to touch, but that these thirsty sands"
12284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before our fleet will be enforc’d to drink our headlong death.
12285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which to prevent by all fit means, I would the parted breath"
12286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of good Patroclus, to his friend, with speed imparted were,"
12287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By some he loves; for, I believe, no heavy messenger"
12288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath yet inform’d him. But alas! I see no man to send,"
12289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Both men and horse are hid in mists that ev’ry way descend.
12290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O father Jupiter, do thou the sons of Greece release"
12291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of this felt darkness; grace this day with fit transparences;
12292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And give the eyes thou giv’st, their use; destroy us in the light,"
12293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And work thy will with us, since needs thou wilt against us fight.”"
12294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This spake he weeping, and his tears Saturnius pity show’d,"
12295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dispers’d the darkness instantly, and drew away the cloud"
12296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From whence it fell; the sun shin’d out, and all the host appear’d;"
12297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then spake Ajax, whose heard pray’r his spirits highly cheer’d:"
12298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Brave Menelaus, look about; and if thou canst descry"
12299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nestor’s Antilochus alive, incite him instantly"
12300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To tell Achilles that his friend, most dear to him, is dead.”"
12301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He said, nor Menelaus stuck at any thing he said,"
12302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As loth to do it, but he went. As from a grazier’s stall"
12303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A lion goes, when overlaid with men, dogs, darts, and all,"
12304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not eas’ly losing a fat ox, but strong watch all night held,"
12305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His teeth yet wat’ring, oft he comes, and is as oft repell’d,"
12306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The adverse darts so thick are pour’d before his brow-hid eyes,"
12307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And burning firebrands which, for all his great heart’s heat, he flies,"
12308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, grumbling, goes his way betimes; so from Patroclus went"
12309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Atrides, much against his mind, his doubts being vehement"
12310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest, he gone from his guard, the rest would leave for very fear"
12311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The person to the spoil of Greece. And yet his guardians were
12312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ Ajaces and Meriones; whom much his care did press,"
12313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus exhort: “Ajaces both, and you Meriones,"
12314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Now let some true friend call to mind the gentle and sweet nature
12315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of poor Patroclus; let him think, how kind to ev’ry creature"
12316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His heart was living, though now dead.” Thus urg’d the fair-hair’d"
12317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"king,"
12318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And parted, casting round his eye. As when upon her wing"
12319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An eagle is, whom men affirm to have the sharpest sight"
12320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all air’s region of fowls, and, though of mighty height,"
12321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sees yet within her leavy form of humble shrubs, close laid,"
12322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A light-foot hare, which straight she stoops, trusses, and strikes her"
12323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,dead;
12324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So dead thou strook’st thy charge, O king, through all war’s thickets"
12325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,so
12326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou look’dst, and swiftly found’st thy man exhorting ’gainst the foe,"
12327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And heart’ning his plied men to blows us’d in the war’s left wing;
12328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whom thou saidst: “Thou god-lov’d man, come here, and hear a thing"
12329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which I wish never were to hear. I think ev’n thy eye sees
12330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What a destruction God hath laid upon the sons of Greece,"
12331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And what a conquest he gives Troy; in which the best of men,"
12332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus, lies exanimate, whose person passing fain"
12333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Greeks would rescue and bear home; and therefore give thy speed
12334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his great friend, to prove if he will do so good a deed"
12335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fetch the naked person off, for Hector’s shoulders wear"
12336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His priséd arms.” Antilochus was highly griev’d to hear
12337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This heavy news, and stood surpris’d with stupid silence long;"
12338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fair eyes standing full of tears; his voice, so sweet and strong"
12339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Stuck in his bosom; yet all this wrought in him no neglect
12340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of what Atrides gave in charge, but for that quick effect"
12341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He gave Laodocus his arms (his friend that had the guide
12342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his swift horse) and then his knees were speedily applied
12343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his sad message, which his eyes told all the way in tears."
12344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor would thy gen’rous heart assist his sore charg’d soldiers,"
12345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O Menelaus, in mean time, though left in much distress;"
12346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou sent’st them god-like Thrasymede, and mad’st thy kind regress"
12347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Back to Patroclus; where arriv’d, half breathless thou didst say"
12348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To both th’ Ajaces: “I have sent this messenger away
12349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To swift Achilles, who, I fear, will hardly help us now,"
12350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though mad with Hector; without arms he cannot fight, ye know."
12351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let us then think of some best mean, both how we may remove"
12352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The body, and get off ourselves from this vocif’rous drove,"
12353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And fate of Trojans.” “Bravely spoke at all parts,” Ajax said,"
12354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O glorious son of Atreus. Take thou then straight the dead,"
12355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thou, Meriones; we two, of one mind as one name,"
12356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will back ye soundly, and on us receive the wild-fire flame"
12357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Hector’s rage breathes after you, before it come at you.”"
12358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, they took into their arms the body; all the show,"
12359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That might be, made to those of Troy; at arm’s end bearing it."
12360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out shriek’d the Trojans when they saw the body borne to fleet,"
12361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And rush’d on. As at any boar, gash’d with the hunter’s wounds,"
12362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A kennel of the sharpest set and sorest bitten hounds
12363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before their youthful huntsmen haste, and eagerly awhile"
12364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pursue, as if they were assur’d of their affected spoil;"
12365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when the savage, in his strength as confident as they,"
12366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Turns head amongst them, back they fly, and ev’ry one his way;"
12367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So troop-meal Troy pursu’d awhile, laying on with swords and darts;"
12368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when th’ Ajaces turn’d on them, and made their stand, their hearts"
12369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Drunk from their faces all their bloods, and not a man sustain’d"
12370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The forechace, nor the after-fight. And thus Greece nobly gain’d"
12371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The person towards home. But thus, the changing war was rack’d"
12372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out to a passing bloody length; for as, once put in act,"
12373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A fire, invading city roofs, is suddenly engrost,"
12374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And made a wondrous mighty flame, in which is quickly lost"
12375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A house long building, all the while a boist’rous gust of wind"
12376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lumb’ring amongst it; so the Greeks, in bearing off their friend,"
12377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More and more foes drew, at their heels a tumult thund’ring still"
12378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of horse and foot. Yet as when mules, in haling from a hill"
12379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A beam or mast, through foul deep way, well-clapp’d, and hearten’d,"
12380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,close
12381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lie to their labour, tug and sweat, and passing hard it goes,"
12382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Urg’d by their drivers to all haste; so dragg’d they on the corse,"
12383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still both th’ Ajaces at their backs, who back still turn’d the force,"
12384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though after it grew still the more. Yet as a sylvan hill
12385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrusts back a torrent, that hath kept a narrow channel still,"
12386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till at his oaken breast it beats, but there a check it takes,"
12387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That sends it over all the vale, with all the stir it makes,"
12388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor can with all the confluence break through his rooty sides;
12389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In no less firm and brave repulse, th’ Ajaces curb’d the prides"
12390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Trojans; yet all held the pursuit in his strength,"
12391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their chiefs being Hector, and the son of Venus, who at length"
12392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put all the youth of Greece besides in most amazeful rout,"
12393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forgetting all their fortitudes, distraught, and shrieking out"
12394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A number of their rich arms lost, fall’n from them here and there,"

12521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So much wrong to thy grievéd mind, my death being set so soon,"
12522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And never suff’ring my return to grace of Peleus’ court!
12523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor do I wish it; nor to live in any man’s resort,"
12524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But only that the crying blood, for vengeance of my friend"
12525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mangled by Hector, may be still’d; his foe’s death paying his end.”"
12526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She, weeping, said: “That hour is near, and thy death’s hour then nigh;"
12527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, in thy wish serv’d of thy foe, succeedeth instantly.”"
12528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“And instantly it shall succeed,” he answer’d “since my fate"
12529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Allow’d not to my will a pow’r to rescue, ere the date"
12530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his late slaughter, my true friend. Far from his friends he died,"
12531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose wrong therein my eyes had light and right to see denied.
12532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet now I neither light myself, nor have so spent my light,"
12533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That either this friend or the rest (in numbers infinite
12534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Slaughter’d by Hector) I can help, nor grace with wish’d repair"
12535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To our dear country, but breathe here unprofitable air,"
12536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And only live a load to earth with all my strength, though none"
12537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all the Grecians equal it. In counsel many a one
12538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is my superior; what I have, no grace gets; what I want"
12539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Disgraceth all. How then too soon can hastiest death supplant
12540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My fate-curst life? Her instrument to my indignity
12541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Being that black fiend Contention; whom would to God might die
12542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Gods and men; and Anger too, that kindles tyranny"
12543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In men most wise, being much more sweet than liquid honey is"
12544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To men of pow’r to satiate their watchful enmities;
12545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And like a pliant fume it spreads through all their breasts; as late
12546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It stole stern passage thorough mine, which he did instigate"
12547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That is our Gen’ral. But the fact so long past, the effect"
12548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must vanish with it, though both griev’d; nor must we still respect"
12549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our soothéd humours. Need now takes the rule of either’s mind.
12550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And when the loser of my friend his death in me shall find,"
12551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let death take all. Send him, ye Gods, I’ll give him my embrace."
12552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not Hercules himself shunn’d death, though dearest in the grace"
12553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Jupiter; ev’n him Fate stoop’d, and Juno’s cruelty."
12554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And if such fate expect my life, where death strikes I will lie."
12555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Meantime I wish a good renown that these deep breasted dames
12556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Ilion and Dardania may, for the extinguish’d flames"
12557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of their friends’ lives, with both their hands wipe miserable tears"
12558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From their so-curiously-kept cheeks, and be the officers"
12559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To execute my sighs on Troy, when (seeing my long retreat"
12560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But gather’d strength, and gives my charge an answerable heat)"
12561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They well may know ’twas I lay still, and that my being away"
12562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Presented all their happiness. But any further stay
12563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Which your much love perhaps may wish) assay not to persuade;
12564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All vows are kept, all pray’rs heard; now, free way for fight is made.”"
12565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The silver-footed Dame replied: “It fits thee well, my son,"
12566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To keep destruction from thy friends; but those fair arms are won
12567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And worn by Hector, that should keep thyself in keeping them,"
12568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though their fruition be but short, a long death being near him,"
12569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose cruel glory they are yet. By all means then forbear
12570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To tread the massacres of war, till I again appear"
12571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Mulciber with fit new arms; which, when thy eye shall see"
12572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sun next rise, shall enter here with his first beams and me.”"
12573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus to her Sisters of the Sea she turn’d, and bade them ope"
12574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The doors and deeps of Nereüs; she in Olympus’ top
12575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must visit Vulcan for new arms to serve her wreakful son,"
12576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bade inform her father so, with all things further done."
12577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, they underwent the sea, herself flew up to heav’n."
12578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In mean space, to the Hellespont and ships the Greeks were driv’n"
12579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In shameful rout; nor could they yet, from rage of Priam’s son,"
12580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Secure the dead of new assaults, both horse and men made on"
12581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such impression. Thrice the feet the hands of Hector seiz’d,"
12582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thrice th’ Ajaces thump’d him off. With whose repulse displeas’d,"
12583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He wreak’d his wrath upon the troops, then to the corse again"
12584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made horrid turnings, crying out of his repulséd men,"
12585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And would not quit him quite for death. A lion almost sterv’d
12586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is not by upland herdsman driv’n, from urging to be serv’d,"
12587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With more contention, than his strength by those two of a name;"
12588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And had perhaps his much-prais’d will, if th’ airy-footed Dame,"
12589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Swift Iris, had not stoop’d in haste, ambassadress from heav’n"
12590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Peleus’ son, to bid him arm; her message being giv’n"
12591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Juno, kept from all the Gods; she thus excited him:"
12592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Rise, thou most terrible of men, and save the precious limb"
12593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of thy belov’d; in whose behalf, the conflict now runs high"
12594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before the fleet, the either host fells other mutually,"
12595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These to retain, those to obtain. Amongst whom most of all"
12596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is Hector prompt, he’s apt to drag thy friend home, he your pall"
12597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will make his shoulders; his head forc’d, he’ll be most famous; rise,"
12598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No more lie idle, set the foe a much more costly prize"
12599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of thy friend’s value than let dogs make him a monument,"
12600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where thy name will be grav’n.” He ask’d, “What Deity hath sent"
12601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy presence hither?” She replied: “Saturnia, she alone,"
12602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not high Jove knowing, nor one God that doth inhabit on"
12603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Snowy Olympus.” He again: “How shall I set upon
12604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The work of slaughter, when mine arms are worn by Priam’s son?"
12605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How will my Goddess-mother grieve, that bade I should not arm"
12606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till she brought arms from Mulciber! But should I do such harm
12607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To her and duty, who is he, but Ajax, that can vaunt"
12608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The fitting my breast with his arms; and he is conversant
12609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the first in use of his, and rampires of the foe"
12610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Slain near Patroclus builds to him?” “All this,” said she, “we know,"
12611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And wish thou only wouldst but show thy person to the eyes
12612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of these hot Ilians, that, afraid of further enterprise,"
12613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks may gain some little breath.” She woo’d, and he was won;"
12614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And straight Minerva honour’d him, who Jove’s shield clapp’d upon"
12615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mighty shoulders, and his head girt with a cloud of gold"
12616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That cast beams round about his brows. And as when arms enfold
12617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A city in an isle, from thence a fume at first appears,"
12618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being in the day, but, when the even her cloudy forehead rears,"
12619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thick show the fires, and up they cast their splendour, that men nigh,"
12620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Seeing their distress, perhaps may set ships out to their supply;"
12621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So (to show such aid) from his head a light rose, scaling heav’n,"
12622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And forth the wall he stept and stood, nor brake the precept giv’n"
12623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By his great mother, mix’d in fight, but sent abroad his voice;"
12624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which Pallas far-off echoéd, who did betwixt them hoise"
12625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shrill tumult to a topless height. And as a voice is heard
12626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With emulous affectión, when any town is spher’d"
12627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With siege of such a foe as kills men’s minds, and for the town"
12628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Makes sound his trumpet; so the voice from Thetis’ issue thrown
12629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Won emulously th’ ears of all. His brazen voice once heard,"
12630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The minds of all were startled so they yielded; and so fear’d
12631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fair-man’d horses, that they flew back, and their chariots turn’d,"
12632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Presaging in their augurous hearts the labours that they mourn’d
12633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A little after; and their guides a repercussive dread
12634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took from the horrid radiance of his refulgent head,"
12635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which Pallas set on fire with grace. Thrice great Achilles spake,"
12636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And thrice (in heat of all the charge) the Trojans started back.
12637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve men, of greatest strength in Troy, left with their lives exhal’d"
12638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their chariots and their darts, to death with his three summons call’d."
12639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then the Grecians spritefully drew from the darts the corse,"
12640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And hears’d it, bearing it to fleet; his friends with all remorse"
12641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Marching about it. His great friend dissolving then in tears
12642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see his truly-lov’d return’d, so hors’d upon an hearse,"
12643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom with such horse and chariot he set out safe and whole,"
12644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now wounded with unpitying steel, now sent without a soul,"
12645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Never again to be restor’d, never receiv’d but so,"
12646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He follow’d mourning bitterly. The sun (yet far to go)
12647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Juno commanded to go down; who, in his pow’r’s despite,"
12648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sunk to the ocean, over earth dispersing sudden night."
12649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then the Greeks and Trojans both gave up their horse and darts.
12650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans all to council call’d, ere they refresh’d their hearts"
12651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any supper, nor would sit; they grew so stiff with fear"
12652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see, so long from heavy fight, Æacides appear."
12653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Polydamas began to speak, who only could discern"
12654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Things future by things past, and was vow’d friend to Hector, born"
12655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In one night both. He thus advis’d: “Consider well, my friends,"
12656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this so great and sudden change, that now itself extends,"
12657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,What change is best for us t’ oppose. To this stands my command:
12658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Make now the town our strength, not here abide light’s rosy hand,"
12659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our wall being far off, and our foe, much greater, still as near."
12660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till this foe came, I well was pleas’d to keep our watches here,"
12661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My fit hope of the fleet’s surprise inclin’d me so; but now
12662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Tis stronglier guarded, and, their strength increas’d, we must allow"
12663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our own proportionate amends. I doubt exceedingly
12664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That this indiff’rency of fight ’twixt us and th’ enemy,"
12665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And these bounds we prefix to them, will nothing so confine"
12666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Th’ uncurb’d mind of Æacides. The height of his design
12667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Aims at our city and our wives; and all bars in his way
12668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Being back’d with less than walls) his pow’r will scorn to make his
12669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"stay,"
12670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And over-run, as over-seen and not his object. Then"
12671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let Troy be freely our retreat; lest, being enforc’d, our men"
12672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Twixt this and that be taken up by vultures, who by night"
12673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May safe come off, it being a time untimely for his might"
12674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To spend at random; that being sure. If next light show us here
12675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his assaults, each man will wish, that Troy his refuge were,"
12676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And then feel what he hears not now. I would to heav’n mine ear
12677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were free ev’n now of those complaints, that you must after hear"
12678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If ye remove not! If ye yield, though wearied with a fight"
12679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So late and long, we shall have strength in council and the night."
12680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And (where we here have no more force, than need will force us to,"
12681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And which must rise out of our nerves) high ports, tow’rs, walls will"
12682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,do
12683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What wants in us; and in the morn, all arm’d upon our tow’rs,"
12684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We all will stand out to our foe. ’Twill trouble all his pow’rs,"
12685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To come from fleet and give us charge, when his high-crested horse"
12686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His rage shall satiate with the toil of this and that way’s course,"
12687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Vain entry seeking underneath our well-defended walls,"
12688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he be glad to turn to fleet, about his funerals."
12689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For of his entry here at home, what mind will serve his thirst,"
12690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or ever feed him with sack’d Troy? The dogs shall eat him first.”
12691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At this speech Hector bent his brows, and said: “This makes not great"
12692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your grace with me, Polydamas, that argue for retreat"
12693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To Troy’s old prison. Have we not enough of those tow’rs yet?
12694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And is not Troy yet charg’d enough, with impositions set"
12695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon her citizens, to keep our men from spoil without,"
12696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But still we must impose within? That houses with our rout
12697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As well as purses may be plagu’d? Before time, Priam’s town"
12698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Traffick’d with divers-languag’d men, and all gave the renown"
12699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of rich Troy to it, brass and gold abounding; but her store"
12700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is now from ev’ry house exhaust; possessions evermore
12701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Are sold out into Phrygia and lovely Mæony;
12702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And have been ever since Jove’s wrath. And now his clemency
12703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gives me the mean to quit our want with glory, and conclude"
12704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks in sea-bords and our seas, to slack it, and extrude"
12705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His offer’d bounty by our flight. Fool that thou art, bewray"
12706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This counsel to no common ear, for no man shall obey;"
12707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If any will, I’ll check his will. But what our self command,"
12708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let all observe. Take suppers all, keep watch of ev’ry hand."
12709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If any Trojan have some spoil, that takes his too much care,"
12710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Make him dispose it publicly; ’tis better any fare
12711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The better for him, than the Greeks. When light then decks the skies,"
12712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let all arm for a fierce assault. If great Achilles rise,"
12713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And will enforce our greater toil, it may rise so to him."
12714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On my back he shall find no wings, my spirit shall force my limb"
12715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To stand his worst, and give or take. Mars is our common lord,"
12716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And the desirous swordsman’s life he ever puts to sword.”
12717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This counsel gat applause of all, so much were all unwise;"
12718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva robb’d them of their brains, to like the ill advice"
12719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The great man gave, and leave the good since by the meaner given."
12720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All took their suppers; but the Greeks spent all the heavy even
12721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About Patroclus’ mournful rites, Pelides leading all"
12722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all the forms of heaviness. He by his side did fall,"
12723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And his man-slaught’ring hands impos’d into his oft-kiss’d breast,"
12724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sighs blew up sighs; and lion-like, grac’d with a goodly crest,"
12725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That in his absence being robb’d by hunters of his whelps,"
12726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Returns to his so desolate den, and, for his wanted helps,"
12727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beholding his unlook’d-for wants, flies roaring back again,"
12728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hunts the sly hunter, many a vale resounding his disdain;"
12729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So mourn’d Pelides his late loss, so weighty were his moans,"
12730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, for their dumb sounds, now gave words to all his Myrmidons:"
12731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Gods,” said he, “how vain a vow I made, to cheer the mind"
12732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of sad Menœtius, when his son his hand to mine resign’d,"
12733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That high-tow’r’d Opus he should see, and leave ras’d Ilion"
12734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With spoil and honour, ev’n with me! But Jove vouchsafes to none"
12735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wish’d passages to all his vows; we both were destinate
12736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To bloody one earth here in Troy; nor any more estate
12737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In my return hath Peleüs or Thetis; but because
12738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I last must undergo the ground, I’ll keep no fun’ral laws,"
12739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O my Patroclus, for thy corse, before I hither bring"
12740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The arms of Hector and his head to thee for offering.
12741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve youths, the most renown’d of Troy, I’ll sacrifice beside,"
12742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before thy heap of funeral, to thee unpacified."
12743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In mean time, by our crooked sterns lie, drawing tears from me,"
12744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And round about thy honour’d corse, these dames of Dardanie,"
12745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Ilion, with the ample breasts (whom our long spears and pow’rs"
12746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And labours purchas’d from the rich and by-us-ruin’d tow’rs,"
12747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And cities strong and populous with divers-languag’d men)
12748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall kneel, and neither day nor night be licens’d to abstain"
12749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From solemn watches, their toil’d eyes held ope with endless tears.”"
12750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This passion past, he gave command to his near soldiers"
12751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To put a tripod to the fire, to cleanse the fester’d gore"
12752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From off the person. They obey’d, and presently did pour"
12753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fresh water in it, kindled wood, and with an instant flame"
12754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The belly of the tripod girt, till fire’s hot quality came"
12755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the water. Then they wash’d, and fill’d the mortal wound"
12756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With wealthy oil of nine years old; then wrapp’d the body round
12757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In largeness of a fine white sheet, and put it then in bed;"
12758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When all watch’d all night with their lord, and spent sighs on the"
12759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,dead.
12760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Jove ask’d Juno: “If at length she had sufficed her spleen,"
12761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Achilles being won to arms? Or if she had not been
12762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The natural mother of the Greeks, she did so still prefer"
12763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their quarrel?” She, incens’d, ask’d: “Why he still was taunting her,"
12764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For doing good to those she lov’d? since man to man might show
12765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kind offices, though thrall to death, and though they did not know"
12766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Half such deep counsels as disclos’d beneath her far-seeing state,"
12767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She, reigning queen of Goddesses, and being in generate"
12768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of one stock with himself, besides the state of being his wife"
12769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And must her wrath, and ill to Troy, continue such a strife"
12770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From time to time ’twixt him and her?” This private speech they had.
12771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And now the Silver-footed Queen had her ascension made
12772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To that incorruptible house, that starry golden court"
12773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of fi’ry Vulcan, beautiful amongst th’ immortal sort,"
12774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which yet the lame God built himself. She found him in a sweat
12775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About his bellows, and in haste had twenty tripods beat."
12776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To set for stools about the sides of his well-builded hall,"
12777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whose feet little wheels of gold he put, to go withal,"
12778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And enter his rich dining room, alone, their motion free,"
12779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And back again go out alone, miraculous to see."
12780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus much he had done of them, yet handles were to add,"
12781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For which he now was making studs. And while their fashion had
12782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Employment of his skilful hand, bright Thetis was come near;"
12783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom first fair well-hair’d Charis saw, that was the nuptial fere"
12784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of famous Vulcan, who the hand of Thetis took, and said:"
12785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Why, fair-train’d, lov’d, and honour’d dame, are we thus visited"
12786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By your kind presence? You, I think, were never here before."
12787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come near, that I may banquet you, and make you visit more.”"
12788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She led her in, and in a chair of silver (being the fruit"
12789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Vulcan’s hand) she made her sit, a footstool of a suit"
12790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apposing to her crystal feet; and call’d the God of fire,"
12791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Thetis was arriv’d, she said, and entertain’d desire"
12792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of some grace that his art might grant. “Thetis to me,” said he,"
12793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Is mighty, and most reverend, as one that nourish’d me,"
12794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When grief consum’d me, being cast from heaven by want of shame"
12795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In my proud mother, who, because she brought me forth so lame,"
12796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would have me made away; and then, had I been much distress’d"
12797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had Thetis and Eurynome in either’s silver breast
12798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not rescu’d me; Eurynome that to her father had
12799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Reciprocal Oceanus. Nine years with them I made
12800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A number of well-arted things, round bracelets, buttons brave,"
12801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whistles, and carquenets. My forge stood in a hollow cave,"
12802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About which, murmuring with foam, th’ unmeasur’d ocean"
12803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was ever beating; my abode known nor to God nor man,"
12804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But Thetis and Eurynome, and they would see me still,"

12823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is our court honour’d with thy state, that hast not heretofore"
12824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Perform’d this kindness? Speak thy thoughts, thy suit can be no more"
12825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Than my mind gives me charge to grant. Can my pow’r get it wrought?

12839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That never I shall see him more return’d to Peleus’ court.
12840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all that short life he hath spent in most unhappy sort;

12842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Grecians, yet this dame Atrides countermands;"
12843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For which in much disdain he mourn’d, and almost pin’d away."
12844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet for this wrong he receiv’d some honour, I must say;"
12845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks, being shut up at their ships, not suffer’d to advance"
12846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A head out of their batter’d sterns; and mighty suppliance

12848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For his reflection; yet he still kept close, and saw enclos’d"

12874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A mighty anvil; his right hand a weighty hammer held,"

12882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In it the never-wearied Sun, the Moon exactly round,"
12883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all those Stars with which the brows of ample heav’n are crown’d,"

12888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His golden forehead never bows to th’ Ocean empery.
12889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two cities in the spacious shield he built, with goodly state"
12890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of divers-languag’d men. The one did nuptials celebrate,"
12891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Observing at them solemn feasts, the brides from forth their bow’rs"
12892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With torches usher’d through the streets, a world of paramours"

12901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Both put it to arbitrement. The people cried ’twas best
12902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For both parts, and th’ assistants too gave their dooms like the rest."
12903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The heralds made the people peace. The seniors then did bear

12914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left all their old men, wives, and boys, behind to man their walls,"
12915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And stole out to their enemy’s town. The Queen of martials,"

12936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By both the feet, stripp’d off and took their weeds, with all the"

12938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of blood upon them that their steels had manfully let out.
12939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They far’d as men alive indeed drew dead indeed about.
12940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To these the fi’ry Artizan did add a new-ear’d field,"
12941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Large and thrice plough’d, the soil being soft, and of a wealthy yield;"
12942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And many men at plough he made, that drave earth here and there,"
12943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And turn’d up stitches orderly; at whose end when they were,"
12944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A fellow ever gave their hands full cups of luscious wine;
12945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which emptied, for another stitch, the earth they undermine,"
12946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And long till th’ utmost bound be reach’d of all the ample close.
12947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The soil turn’d up behind the plough, all black like earth arose,"
12948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though forg’d of nothing else but gold, and lay in show as light"
12949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As if it had been plough’d indeed, miraculous to sight."
12950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There grew by this a field of corn, high, ripe, where reapers wrought,"
12951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And let thick handfuls fall to earth, for which some bought"
12952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bands, and made sheaves. Three binders stood, and took the handfuls"
12953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,reap’d
12954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From boys that gather’d quickly up, and by them armfuls heap’d."
12955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst these at furrow’s end, the king stood pleas’d at heart,"
12956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Said no word, but his sceptre show’d. And from him, much apart,"
12957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His harvest-bailiffs underneath an oak a feast prepar’d
12958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And having kill’d a mighty ox, stood there to see him shar’d"

12960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And many white wheat-cakes bestow’d, to make it up a feast."
12961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He set near this a vine of gold, that crack’d beneath the weight"
12962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of bunches black with being ripe; to keep which at the height,"
12963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A silver rail ran all along, and round about it flow’d"
12964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An azure moat, and to this guard, a quickset was bestow’d"
12965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of tin, one only path to all, by which the pressmen came"
12966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In time of vintage. Youths and maids, that bore not yet the flame"
12967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of manly Hymen, baskets bore, of grapes and mellow fruit."
12968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A lad that sweetly touch’d a harp, to which his voice did suit,"

12970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wanton’s pleasure to their minds, that danc’d, sung, whistled too."
12971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A herd of oxen then he carv’d, with high rais’d heads, forg’d all"

12974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Exceeding swift, and full of reeds; and all in yellow coats"
12975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Four herdsmen follow’d; after whom, nine mastiffs went. In head"
12976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the herd, upon a bull, that deadly bellowéd,"
12977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two horrid lions rampt, and seiz’d, and tugg’d off bellowing still;"
12978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both men and dogs came; yet they tore the hide, and lapp’d their fill"
12979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of black blood, and the entrails ate. In vain the men assay’d"
12980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To set their dogs on; none durst pinch, but cur-like stood and bay’d"
12981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In both the faces of their kings, and all their onsets fled."
12982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then in a passing pleasant vale, the famous Artsman fed,"
12983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon a goodly pasture ground, rich flocks of white-fleec’d sheep,"
12984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Built stables, cottages, and cotes, that did the shepherds keep"
12985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From wind and weather. Next to these, he cut a dancing place,"
12986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All full of turnings, that was like the admirable maze"
12987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For fair-hair’d Ariadne made, by cunning Dædalus;"
12988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in it youths and virgins danc’d, all young and beauteous,"

12996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While he is set; and out again, as full of speed they wound,"
12997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not one left fast, or breaking hands. A multitude stood round,"
12998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Delighted with their nimble sport; to end which two begun,"
12999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mids all, a song, and turning sung the sports conclusión,"
13000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All this he circled in the shield, with pouring round about,"

13002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This shield thus done, he forg’d for him, such curets as outshin’d"
13003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The blaze of fire. A helmet then (through which no steel could find
13004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forc’d passage) he compos’d, whose hue a hundred colours took,"
13005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in the crest a plume of gold, that each breath stirr’d, he stuck."
13006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All done, he all to Thetis brought, and held all up to her."

13101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As give it reins. Give you then charge, that for our instant fight"
13102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks may follow me to field, to try if still the night"
13103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will bear out Trojans at our ships. I hope there is some one,"
13104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst their chief encouragers, will thank me to be gone,"
13105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And bring his heart down to his knees in that submissión.”
13106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Greeks rejoic’d to hear the heart of Peleus’ mighty son
13107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So qualified. And then the king (not rising from his throne
13108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For his late hurt) to get good ear, thus order’d his reply:"
13109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Princes of Greece, your states shall suffer no indignity,"
13110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If, being far off, ye stand and hear; nor fits it such as stand"
13111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At greater distance, to disturb the council now in hand"
13112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By uproar, in their too much care of hearing. Some, of force,"
13113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must lose some words; for hard it is, in such a great concourse"
13114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Though hearers’ ears be ne’er so sharp) to touch at all things spoke;
13115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in assemblies of such thrust, how can a man provoke"
13116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fit pow’r to hear, or leave to speak? Best auditors may there"
13117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lose fittest words, and the most vocal orator fit ear."
13118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My main end then, to satisfy Pelides with reply,"
13119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My words shall prosecute; to him my speech especially
13120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall bear direction. Yet I wish, the court in general"
13121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would give fit ear; my speech shall need attentión of all.
13122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Oft have our peers of Greece much blam’d my forcing of the prise
13123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Due to Achilles; of which act, not I, but destinies,"
13124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Jove himself, and black Erinnys (that casts false mists still"
13125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Betwixt us and our actions done, both by her pow’r and will)"
13126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Are authors. What could I do then? The very day and hour
13127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of our debate, that Fury stole in that act on my pow’r."
13128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And more; all things are done by strife; that ancient seed of Jove,"
13129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ate, that hurts all, perfects all, her feet are soft, and move"
13130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not on the earth, they bear her still aloft men’s heads, and there"
13131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The harmful hurts them. Nor was I alone her prisoner,"
13132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove, best of men and Gods, hath been; not he himself hath gone"
13133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beyond her fetters, no, she made a woman put them on;"
13134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For when Alcmena was to vent the force of Hercules
13135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In well-wall’d Thebes, thus Jove triumph’d: ‘Hear, Gods and Goddesses,"
13136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The words my joys urg’d: In this day, Lucina, bringing pain"
13137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To labouring women, shall produce into the light of men"
13138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man that all his neighbour kings shall in his empire hold,"
13139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And vaunt that more than manly race whose honour’d veins enfold
13140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My eminent blood.’ Saturnia conceiv’d a present sleight,"
13141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And urg’d confirmance of his vaunt t’ infringe it; her conceit
13142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In this sort urg’d: ‘Thou wilt not hold thy word with this rare man;
13143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or, if thou wilt, confirm it with the oath Olympian,"
13144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That whosoever falls this day betwixt a woman’s knees,"
13145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of those men’s stocks that from thy blood derive their pedigrees,"
13146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall all his neighbour towns command.’ Jove, ignorant of fraud,"
13147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took that great oath, which his great ill gave little cause t’"
13148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,applaud.
13149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down from Olympus’ top she stoop’d, and quickly reach’d the place"
13150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Argos where the famous wife of Sthenelus, whose race"
13151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He fetch’d from Jove by Perseus, dwelt. She was but sev’n months gone"
13152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With issue, yet she brought it forth; Alcmena’s matchless son"
13153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Delay’d from light, Saturnia repress’d the teeming throes"
13154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his great mother. Up to heav’n she mounts again, and shows,"
13155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In glory, her deceit to Jove. ‘Bright-light’ning Jove,’ said she,"
13156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,‘Now th’ Argives have an emperor; a son deriv’d from thee
13157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is born to Persean Sthenelus, Eurystheus his name,"
13158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Noble and worthy of the rule thou swor’st to him.’ This came
13159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Close to the heart of Jupiter; and Ate, that had wrought"
13160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This anger by Saturnia, by her bright hair he caught,"
13161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Held down her head, and over her made this infallible vow:"
13162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘That never to the cope of stars should reascend that brow,"
13163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being so infortunate to all.’ Thus, swinging her about,"
13164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He cast her from the fi’ry heav’n; who ever since thrust out
13165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her fork’d sting in th’ affairs of men. Jove ever since did grieve,"
13166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since his dear issue Hercules did by his vow achieve
13167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The unjust toils of Eurystheus. Thus fares it now with me,"
13168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since under Hector’s violence the Grecian progeny
13169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Fell so unfitly by my spleen; whose falls will ever stick
13170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In my griev’d thoughts: my weakness yet (Saturnius making sick
13171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The state my mind held) now recur’d, th’ amends shall make ev’n weight"
13172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With my offence. And therefore rouse thy spirits to the fight
13173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With all thy forces; all the gifts, propos’d thee at thy tent"
13174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Last day by royal Ithacus, my officers shall present."
13175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, if it like thee, strike no stroke, though never so on thorns"
13176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy mind stands to thy friend’s revenge, till my command adorns"
13177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy tents and coffers with such gifts, as well may let thee know"
13178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How much I wish thee satisfied.” He answer’d: “Let thy vow,"
13179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Renown’d Atrides, at thy will be kept, as justice would,"
13180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or keep thy gifts; ’tis all in thee. The council now we hold
13181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is for repairing our main field with all our fortitude.
13182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My fair show made brooks no retreat, nor must delays delude"
13183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our deed’s expectance. Yet undone the great work is. All eyes
13184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must see Achilles in first fight depeopling enemies,"
13185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As well as counsel it in court; that ev’ry man set on
13186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,May choose his man to imitate my exercise upon.”
13187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses answer’d: “Do not yet, thou man made like the Gods,"
13188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Take fasting men to field. Suppose, that whatsoever odds"
13189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It brings against them with full men, thy boundless eminence"
13190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Can amply answer, yet refrain to tempt a violence."
13191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The conflict wearing out our men was late, and held as long,"
13192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wherein, though most Jove stood for Troy, he yet made our part strong"
13193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To bear that most. But ’twas to bear, and that breeds little heart."
13194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let wine and bread then add to it; they help the twofold part,"
13195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The soul and body, in a man, both force and fortitude."
13196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All day men cannot fight and fast, though never so indued"
13197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With minds to fight, for, that suppos’d, there lurks yet secretly"
13198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thirst, hunger, in th’ oppresséd joints, which no mind can supply."
13199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They take away a marcher’s knees. Men’s bodies throughly fed,"
13200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their minds share with them in their strength; and, all day combated,"
13201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One stirs not, till you call off all. Dismiss them then to meat,"
13202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And let Atrides tender here, in sight of all this seat,"
13203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The gifts he promis’d. Let him swear before us all, and rise"
13204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To that oath, that he never touch’d in any wanton wise"
13205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The lady he enforc’d. Besides, that he remains in mind"
13206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As chastely satisfied; not touch’d, or privily inclin’d"
13207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With future vantages. And last, ’tis fit he should approve"
13208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All these rites at a solemn feast in honour of your love,"
13209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That so you take no mangled law for merits absolute.
13210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus the honours you receive, resolving the pursuit"
13211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of your friend’s quarrel, well will quit your sorrow for your friend."
13212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thou, Atrides, in the taste of so severe an end,"
13213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Hereafter may on others hold a juster government;
13214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor will it aught impair a king, to give a sound content"
13215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To any subject soundly wrong’d.” “I joy,” replied the king,"
13216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Laertiades, to hear thy lib’ral counselling;"
13217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which is all decorum kept, nor any point lacks touch"
13218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That might be thought on to conclude a reconcilement such
13219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As fits example, and us two. My mind yet makes me swear,"
13220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not your impulsion; and that mind shall rest so kind and clear,"
13221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That I will not forswear to God. Let then Achilles stay,"
13222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though never so inflam’d for fight, and all men here I pray"
13223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To stay, till from my tents these gifts be brought here, and the truce"
13224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At all parts finish’d before all. And thou of all I choose,"
13225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Ulysses, and command to choose of all your host"
13226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Youths of most honour, to present, to him we honour most,"
13227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The gifts we late vow’d, and the dames. Mean space about our tents"
13228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Talthybius shall provide a boar, to crown these kind events"
13229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With thankful sacrifice to Jove, and to the God of Light.”"
13230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles answer’d: “These affairs will show more requisite,"
13231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great king of men, some other time, when our more free estates"
13232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yield fit cessation from the war, and when my spleen abates;"
13233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But now, to all our shames besides, our friends by Hector slain"
13234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(And Jove to friend) lie unfetch’d off. Haste, then, and meat your men;"
13235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though, I must still say, my command would lead them fasting forth,"
13236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all together feast at night. Meat will be something worth,"
13237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When stomachs first have made it way with venting infamy,"
13238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And other sorrows late sustain’d, with long’d-for wreaks, that lie"
13239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Heavy upon them, for right’s sake. Before which load be got"
13240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From off my stomach, meat nor drink, I vow, shall down my throat,"
13241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My friend being dead, who digg’d with wounds, and bor’d through both"
13242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"his feet,"
13243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lies in the entry of my tent, and in the tears doth fleet"
13244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his associates. Meat and drink have little merit then
13245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To comfort me; but blood, and death, and deadly groans of men.”"
13246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The great in counsels yet made good his former counsels thus:
13247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Peleus’ son, of all the Greeks by much most valorous,"
13248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Better and mightier than myself no little with thy lance
13249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I yield thy worth; in wisdom, yet, no less I dare advance"
13250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My right above thee, since above in years, and knowing more."
13251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Let then thy mind rest in thy words. We quickly shall have store
13252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all satiety of fight, whose steel heaps store of straw"
13253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And little corn upon a floor, when Jove, that doth withdraw"
13254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And join all battles, once begins t’ incline his balances,"
13255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In which he weighs the lives of men. The Greeks you must not press
13256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To mourning with the belly; death hath nought to do with that
13257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In healthful men that mourn for friends. His steel we stumble at,"
13258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And fall at, ev’ry day, you see, sufficient store, and fast."
13259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What hour is it that any breathes? We must not use; more haste,"
13260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Than speed holds fit for our revenge. Nor should we mourn too much.
13261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who dead is, must be buriéd. Men’s patience should be such,"
13262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That one day’s moan should serve one man. The dead must end with death,"
13263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And life last with what strengthens life. All those that held their
13264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,breath
13265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From death in fight the more should eat, that so they may supply"
13266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their fellows that have stuck in field, and fight incessantly."
13267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let none expect reply to this, nor stay; for this shall stand"
13268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or fall with some offence to him that looks for new command,"
13269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whoever in dislike holds back. All join then, all things fit"
13270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Allow’d for all; set on a charge, at all parts answering it.”"
13271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he chose, for noblest youths to bear the presents, these:"
13272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sons of Nestor, and with them renown’d Meriones,"
13273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Phylides, Thoas, Lycomed, and Meges, all which went,"
13274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Menalippus, following Ulysses to the tent"
13275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Agamemnon. He but spake, and with the word the deed"
13276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had join’d effect. The fitness well was answer’d in the speed.
13277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The presents, added to the dame the Gen’ral did enforce,"
13278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were twenty caldrons, tripods sev’n, twelve young and goodly horse;"
13279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sev’n ladies excellently seen in all Minerva’s skill,"
13280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The eighth Briseis who had pow’r to ravish ev’ry will;
13281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve talents of the finest gold, all which Ulysses weigh’d"
13282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And carried first; and after him, the other youths convey’d"
13283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The other presents, tender’d all in face of all the court."
13284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up rose the king. Talthybius, whose voice had a report"
13285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like to a God, call’d to the rites. There having brought the boar,"
13286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Atrides with his knife took say upon the part before,"
13287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And lifting up his sacred hands, to Jove to make his vows,"
13288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grave silence strook the cómplete court; when, casting his high brows"
13289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the broad heav’n, thus he spake: “Now witness, Jupiter,"
13290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First, highest, and thou best of Gods; thou Earth that all dost bear;"
13291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou Sun; ye Furies under earth that ev’ry soul torment
13292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom impious perjury distains; that nought incontinent
13293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In bed, or any other act to any slend’rest touch"
13294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my light vows, hath wrong’d the dame; and, let my plagues be such"
13295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As are inflicted by the Gods, in all extremity"
13296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of whomsoever perjur’d men, if godless perjury"
13297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In least degree dishonour me.” This said, the bristled throat"
13298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of the submitted sacrifice, with ruthless steel he cut;"
13299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which straight into the hoary sea Talthybius cast, to feed"
13300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sea-born nation. Then stood up the half-celestial seed
13301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of fair-hair’d Thetis, strength’ning thus Atrides’ innocence:"
13302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O father Jupiter, from thee descends the confluence"
13303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all man’s ill; for now I see the mighty king of men
13304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At no hand forc’d away my prise, nor first inflam’d my spleen"
13305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any set ill in himself, but thou, the King of Gods,"
13306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Incens’d with Greece, made that the mean to all their periods."
13307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which now amend we as we may, and give all suffrages"
13308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To what wise Ithacus advis’d; take breakfasts, and address"
13309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For instant conflict.” Thus he rais’d the court, and all took way"
13310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To sev’ral ships. The Myrmidons the presents did convey
13311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ Achilles’ fleet, and in his tents dispos’d them; doing grace"
13312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of seat and all rights to the dames; the horses put in place
13313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With others of Æacides. When, like love’s golden Queen,"
13314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Briseis all in ghastly wounds had dead Patroclus seen,"
13315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She fell about him, shrieking out, and with her white hands tore"
13316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her hair, breasts, radiant cheeks, and, drown’d in warm tears, did"
13317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,deplore
13318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His cruel destiny. At length she gat pow’r to express
13319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her violent passion, and thus spake this like-the-goddesses:"
13320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O good Patroclus, to my life the dearest grace it had,"
13321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I, wretched dame, departing hence, enforc’d, and dying sad,"
13322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left thee alive, when thou hadst cheer’d my poor captivity,"
13323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And now return’d I find thee dead; misery on misery
13324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ever increasing with my steps. The lord to whom my sire
13325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And dearest mother gave my life in nuptials, his life’s fire"
13326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I saw before our city gates extinguish’d: and his fate
13327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Three of my worthy brothers’ lives, in one womb generate,"
13328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Felt all in that black day of death. And when Achilles’ hand
13329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had slain all these, and ras’d the town Mynetes did command,"
13330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(All cause of never-ending griefs presented) thou took’st all
13331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On thy endeavour to convert to joy as general,"
13332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Affirming, he that hurt should heal, and thou wouldst make thy friend,"
13333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brave captain that thou wert, supply my vowéd husband’s end,"
13334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in rich Phthia celebrate, amongst his Myrmidons,"
13335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our nuptial banquets; for which grace, with these most worthy moans"
13336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I never shall be satiate, thou ever being kind,"
13337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ever delightsome, one sweet grace fed still with one sweet mind.”"
13338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus spake she weeping; and with her, did th’ other ladies moan"
13339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus’ fortunes in pretext, but in sad truth their own."
13340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About Æacides himself the kings of Greece were plac’d,"
13341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Entreating him to food; and he entreated them as fast,"
13342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still intermixing words and sighs, if any friend were there"
13343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all his dearest, they would cease, and offer him no cheer"
13344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But his due sorrows; for before the sun had left that sky
13345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He would not eat, but of that day sustain th’ extremity."
13346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus all the kings, in res’lute grief and fasting, he dismiss’d;"
13347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But both th’ Atrides, Ithacus, and war’s old Martialist,"
13348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Idomenëus and his friend, and Phœnix, these remain’d"
13349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Endeavouring comfort, but no thought of his vow’d woe restrain’d."
13350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor could, till that day’s bloody fight had calm’d his blood; he still"
13351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Remember’d something of his friend, whose good was all his ill."
13352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their urging meat the diligent fashion of his friend renew’d
13353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In that excitement: “Thou,” said he, “when this speed was pursued"
13354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the Trojans, evermore apposedst in my tent"
13355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A pleasing breakfast; being so free, and sweetly diligent,"
13356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou mad’st all meat sweet. Then the war was tearful to our foe
13357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But now to me; thy wounds so wound me, and thy overthrow;"
13358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For which my ready food I fly, and on thy longings feed."
13359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nothing could more afflict me; Fame relating the foul deed
13360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my dear father’s slaughter, blood drawn from my sole son’s heart,"
13361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No more could wound me. Curséd man, that in this foreign part"
13362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(For hateful Helen) my true love, my country, sire, and son,"
13363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I thus should part with. Scyros now gives educatión,[1]"
13364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O Neoptolemus, to thee, if living yet; from whence"
13365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I hop’d, dear friend, thy longer life safely return’d from hence,"
13366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And my life quitting thine, had pow’r to ship him home, and show"
13367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His young eyes Phthia, subjects, court; my father being now"
13368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dead, or most short-liv’d, troublous age oppressing him, and fear"
13369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still of my death’s news.” These sad words, he blew into the ear"
13370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of ev’ry visitant with sighs, all echo’d by the peers,"
13371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rememb’ring who they left at home. All whose so humane tears
13372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove pitied; and, since they all would in the good of one"
13373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be much reviv’d, he thus bespake Minerva: “Thetis’ son,"
13374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now, daughter, thou hast quite forgot. O, is Achilles care"
13375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Extinguish’d in thee? Prostrated in most extreme ill fare,"
13376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He lies before his high-sail’d fleet, for his dead friend; the rest"
13377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are strength’ning them with meat, but he lies desp’rately oppress’d"
13378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With heartless fasting. Go thy ways, and to his breast instill"
13379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Red nectar and ambrosia, that fast procure no ill"
13380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his near enterprise.” This spur he added to the free,"
13381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, like a harpy, with a voice that shrieks so dreadfully,"
13382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And feathers that like needles prick’d, she stoop’d through all the"
13383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"stars,"
13384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the Grecians, all whose tents were now fill’d for the wars;"
13385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her seres strook through Achilles’ tent, and closely she instill’d"
13386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Heav’n’s most-to-be-desired feast to his great breast, and fill’d"
13387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sinews with that sweet supply, for fear unsavoury fast"
13388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Should creep into his knees. Herself the skies again enchas’d.

13393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Flow’d from the navy’s hollow womb. Their splendours gave heav’n’s eye
13394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His beams again. Earth laugh’d to see her face so like the sky;
13395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arms shin’d so hot, and she such clouds made with the dust she cast,"
13396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She thunder’d, feet of men and horse importun’d her so fast."
13397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In midst of all, divine Achilles his fair person arm’d,"
13398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His teeth gnash’d as he stood, his eyes so full of fire they warm’d,"
13399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Unsuffer’d grief and anger at the Trojans so combin’d.
13400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His greaves first us’d, his goodly curets on his bosom shin’d,"
13401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sword, his shield that cast a brightness from it like the moon."
13402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And as from sea sailors discern a harmful fire let run

13407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ominous radiance, and in heav’n impress’d his fervent blaze."
13408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His crested helmet, grave and high, had next triumphant place"
13409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his curl’d head, and like a star it cast a spurry ray,"
13410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About which a bright thicken’d bush of golden hair did play,"
13411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which Vulcan forg’d him for his plume. Thus cómplete arm’d, he tried"
13412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"How fit they were, and if his motion could with ease abide"
13413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their brave instruction; and so far they were from hind’ring it,"
13414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That to it they were nimble wings, and made so light his spirit,"
13415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That from the earth the princely captain they took up to air.
13416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then from his armoury he drew his lance, his father’s spear,"
13417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Huge, weighty, firm, that not a Greek but he himself alone"
13418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Knew how to shake; it grew upon the mountain Pelion,"
13419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From whóse height Chiron hew’d it for his sire, and fatal ’twas"
13420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To great-soul’d men, of Peleus and Pelion surnam’d Pelias."
13421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then from the stable their bright horse, Automedon withdraws"
13422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Alcymus; put poitrils on, and cast upon their jaws"
13423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their bridles, hurling back the reins, and hung them on the seat."
13424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fair scourge then Automedon takes up, and up doth get"
13425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To guide the horse. The fight’s seat last, Achilles took behind;"
13426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who look’d so arm’d as if the sun, there fall’n from heav’n, had"
13427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"shin’d,"
13428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And terribly thus charg’d his steeds: “Xanthus and Balius,"

13431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, when with blood, for this day’s fast observ’d, revenge shall yield"
13432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our heart satiety, bring us off.” Thus, since Achilles spake"
13433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As if his aw’d steeds understood, ’twas Juno’s will to make"
13434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Vocal the palate of the one; who, shaking his fair head,"
13435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Which in his mane, let fall to earth, he almost buried)"
13436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus Xanthus spake: “Ablest Achilles, now, at least, our care"

13438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of thy grave ruin. Nor shall we be then to be reprov’d,"

13441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The best of Gods, Latona’s son, that wears the golden hair,"

13444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For pow’r of wing, could run him off; but thou thyself must go,"
13445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So fate ordains; God and a man must give thee overthrow.”
13446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, the Furies stopp’d his voice. Achilles, far in rage,"
13447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus answer’d him: “It fits not thee, thus proudly to presage"
13448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My overthrow. I know myself, it is my fate to fall"
13449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus far from Phthia; yet that fate shall fail to vent her gall,"

13567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Xanthus by Gods, by men Scamander, call’d. Thus God ’gainst God"

13569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To cope with Hector; past all these, his spirit stood inclin’d"
13570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To glut Mars with the blood of him. And at Æacides
13571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Apollo sent Anchises’ son; but first he did impress
13572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A more than natural strength in him, and made him feel th’ excess"
13573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Infus’d from heav’n; Lycaon’s shape gave show to his address,"
13574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Old Priam’s son) and thus he spake: “Thou counsellor of Troy,"

13576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of thy fight with Æacides? Thy tongue once, steep’d in wine,"
13577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Durst vaunt as much.” He answer’d him: “But why wouldst thou incline

13579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I mean not now to bid him blows. That fear sounds my retreat,"

13586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His pow’rs to spoil) had ruin’d me, for these ears heard her cry:"
13587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Kill, kill the seed of Ilion, kill th’ Asian Lelegi.’"
13588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mere man then must not fight with him that still hath Gods to friend,"
13589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Averting death on others’ darts, and giving his no end"

13592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his proud shoulders, nor he ’scape, though all of brass he boasts"
13593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His plight consisteth.” He replied: “Pray thou those Gods of hosts,"
13594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom he implores, as well as he; and his chance may be thine;"
13595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou cam’st of Gods like him; the Queen that reigns in Salamine

13635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks good meaning, casting all thick mantles made of clouds"
13636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On their bright shoulders. Th’ oppos’d Gods sat hid in other shrouds
13637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On top of steep Callicolon, about thy golden sides,"
13638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O Phœbus, brandisher of darts, and thine, whose rage abides"
13639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No peace in cities. In this state, these Gods in council sate,"
13640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All ling’ring purpos’d fight, to try who first would elevate"
13641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His heav’nly weapon. High-thron’d Jove cried out to set them on,"
13642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Said, all the field was full of men, and that the earth did groan"
13643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With feet of proud encounterers, burn’d with the arms of men"
13644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And barbed horse. Two champions for both the armies then
13645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Met in their midst prepar’d for blows; divine Æacides,"
13646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Venus’ son. Æneas first stepp’d threat’ning forth the prease,"
13647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His high helm nodding, and his breast barr’d with a shady shield,"
13648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And shook his jav’lin. Thetis’ son did his part to the field.
13649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As when the harmful king of beasts (sore threaten’d to be slain
13650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By all the country up in arms) at first makes coy disdain
13651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prepare resistance, but at last, when anyone hath led"
13652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bold charge upon him with his dart, he then turns yawning head,"

13655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their own pow’r, his eyes glow, he roars, and in he leaps to kill,"
13656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Secure of killing; so his pow’r then rous’d up to his will
13657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Matchless Achilles, coming on to meet Anchises’ son."
13658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both near, Achilles thus inquir’d: “Why stand’st thou thus alone,"
13659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou son of Venus? Calls thy heart to change of blows with me?
13660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sure Troy’s whole kingdom is propos’d: some one hath promis’d thee
13661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The throne of Priam for my life; but Priam’s self is wise,"
13662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, for my slaughter, not so mad to make his throne thy prise."
13663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Priam hath sons to second him. Is’t then some piece of land,"
13664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past others fit to set and sow, that thy victorious hand"
13665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Ilians offer for my head? I hope that prise will prove
13666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No easy conquest. Once, I think, my busy jav’lin drove,"
13667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With terror, those thoughts from your spleen. Retain’st thou not the"
13668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"time,"
13669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When single on th’ Idæan hill I took thee with the crime
13670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of runaway, thy oxen left, and when thou hadst no face"
13671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That I could see; thy knees bereft it, and Lyrnessus was"
13672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The mask for that? Then that mask, too, I open’d to the air"
13673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(By Jove and Pallas’ help) and took the free light from the fair,"

13675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then saft thee. Yet again I hope, they will not add their odds"
13676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To save thy wants, as thou presum’st. Retire then, aim not at"
13677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Troy’s throne by me; fly ere thy soul flies; fools are wise too late.”
13678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He answer’d him: “Hope not that words can child-like terrify
13679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My stroke-proof breast. I well could speak in this indecency,"
13680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And use tart terms; but we know well what stock us both put out,"
13681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Too gentle to bear fruits so rude. Our parents ring about

13687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great-soul’d Anchises; she that holds the Paphian Deity,"

13695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of sacred Ilion spread not yet these fields; those fair-built halls
13696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of divers-languag’d men, not rais’d; all then made populous"
13697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The foot of Ida’s fountful hill. This Jove-got Dardanus

13699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of living mortals; in his fens he fed three thousand mares,"
13700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All neighing by their tender foals, of which twice-six were bred"
13701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By lofty Boreas, their dams lov’d by him as they fed,"
13702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took the brave form of a horse that shook an azure mane,"
13703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And slept with them. These twice-six colts had pace so swift, they ran"
13704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon the top-ayles of corn-ears, nor bent them any whit;"
13705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And when the broad back of the sea their pleasure was to sit,"
13706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The superficies of his waves they slid upon, their hoves"
13707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not dipp’d in dank sweat of his brows. Of Erichthonius’ loves

13720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Why then paint we, like dames, the face of conflict with our words?"
13721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both may give language that a ship, driv’n with a hundred oars,"
13722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Would overburthen. A man’s tongue is voluble, and pours"
13723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Words out of all sorts ev’ry way. Such as you speak you hear.
13724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What then need we vie calumnies, like women that will wear"

13726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Being on their way) they travel so? From words, words may avert;"
13727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From virtue, not. It is your steel, divine Æacides,"
13728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must prove my proof, as mine shall yours.” Thus amply did he ease"
13729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His great heart of his pedigree; and sharply sent away
13730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A dart that caught Achilles’ shield, and rung so it did fray"
13731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The son of Thetis, his fair hand far-thrusting out his shield,"
13732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For fear the long lance had driv’n through. O fool, to think ’twould"
13733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"yield,"
13734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And not to know the God’s firm gifts want want to yield so soon
13735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To men’s poor pow’rs. The eager lance had only conquest won
13736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of two plates, and the shield had five, two forg’d of tin, two brass,"
13737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One, that was centre-plate, of gold; and that forbad the pass"
13738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Anchisiades’s lance. Then sent Achilles forth

13744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And hung the shield up; which hard down Æneas pluck’d, to hide"
13745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His breast from sword blows, shrunk up round, and in his heavy eye"
13746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was much grief shadow’d, much afraid that Pelias stuck so nigh."
13747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then prompt Achilles rushing in, his sword drew; and the field"
13748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rung with his voice. Æneas now, left and let hang his shield,"
13749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all-distracted, up he snatch’d a two-men’s strength of stone,"
13750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And either at his shield or casque he set it rudely gone,"
13751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor car’d where, so it strook a place that put on arms for death."
13752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But he (Achilles came so close) had doubtless sunk beneath
13753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His own death had not Neptune seen and interpos’d the odds
13754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his divine pow’r, utt’ring this to the Achaian Gods:"
13755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“I grieve for this great-hearted man; he will be sent to hell,"
13756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n instantly, by Peleus’ son, being only mov’d to deal"
13757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By Phœbus’ words. What fool is he! Phœbus did never mean
13758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To add to his great words his guard against the ruin then
13759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Summon’d against him. And what cause, hath he to head him on"
13760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To others’ mis’ries, he being clear of any trespass done"
13761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Against the Grecians? Thankful gifts he oft hath giv’n to us.
13762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let us then quit him, and withdraw this combat; for if thus"
13763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles end him, Jove will rage; since his escape in fate"
13764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is purpos’d, lest the progeny of Dardanus take date,"
13765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom Jove, past all his issue, lov’d, begot of mortal dames."
13766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All Priam’s race he hates; and this must propagate the names
13767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Trojans, and their sons’ sons’ rule, to all posterity.”"
13768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Saturnia said: “Make free your pleasure. Save, or let him die."
13769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pallas and I have taken many, and most public, oaths,"

13771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From hated Troy; no, not when all in studied fire she flames"
13772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greek rage, blowing her last coal.” This nothing turn’d his aims"
13773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From present rescue, but through all the whizzing spears he pass’d,"
13774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And came where both were combating; when instantly he cast
13775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A mist before Achilles’ eyes, drew from the earth and shield"
13776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His lance, and laid it at his feet; and then took up and held"
13777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Aloft the light Anchises’ son, who pass’d, with Neptune’s force,"
13778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whole orders of heroës’ heads, and many a troop of horse"
13779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Leap’d over, till the bounds he reach’d of all the fervent broil,"
13780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where all the Caucons’ quarters lay. Thus, far freed from the toil,"
13781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Neptune had time to use these words: “Æneas, who was he"
13782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Gods, that did so much neglect thy good and thee"
13783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To urge thy fight with Thetis’ son, who in immortal rates"
13784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is better and more dear than thee? Hereafter, lest, past fates,"
13785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hell be thy headlong home, retire, make bold stand never near"
13786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where he advanceth. But his fate once satisfied, then bear"
13787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A free and full sail; no Greek else shall end thee.” This reveal’d,"
13788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He left him, and dispers’d the cloud, that all this act conceal’d"
13789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From vex’d Achilles; who again had clear light from the skies,"
13790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, much disdaining the escape, said: “O ye Gods, mine eyes"
13791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discover miracles! My lance submitted, and he gone"
13792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At whom I sent it with desire of his confusion!
13793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Æneas sure was lov’d of heav’n. I thought his vaunt from thence
13794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had flow’d from glory. Let him go, no more experience"
13795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will his mind long for of my hands, he flies them now so clear."
13796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cheer then the Greeks, and others try.” Thus rang’d he ev’rywhere"
13797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Grecian orders; ev’ry man (of which the most look’d on
13798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To see their fresh lord shake his lance) he thus put charge upon:
13799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Divine Greeks, stand not thus at gaze, but man to man apply"
13800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your sev’ral valours. ’Tis a task laid too unequally
13801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On me left to so many men, one man oppos’d to all."
13802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not Mars, immortal and a God, not war’s She-General,"
13803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A field of so much fight could chase, and work it out with blows."
13804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But what a man may execute, that all limbs will expose,"
13805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all their strength to th’ utmost nerve (though now I lost some play
13806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By some strange miracle) no more shall burn in vain the day
13807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To any least beam. All this host, I’ll ransack, and have hope,"
13808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all not one again will scape, whoever gives such scope"
13809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his adventure, and so near dares tempt my angry lance.”"
13810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus he excited. Hector then as much strives to advance
13811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hearts of his men, adding threats, affirming he would stand"
13812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In combat with Æacides: “Give fear,” said he, “no hand"
13813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of your great hearts, brave Ilians, for Peleus’ talking son,"
13814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll fight with any God with words; but when their spears put on,"
13815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The work runs high, their strength exceeds mortality so far,"
13816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And they may make works crown their words; which holds not in the war
13817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles makes; his hands have bounds; this word he shall make good,"
13818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And leave another to the field. His worst shall be withstood
13819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With sole objection of myself; though in his hands he bear
13820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A rage like fire, though fire itself his raging fingers were,"
13821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And burning steel flew in his strength.” Thus he incited his;
13822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And they rais’d lances, and to work with mixéd courages;"
13823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And up flew Clamour. But the heat in Hector, Phœbus gave"
13824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This temper: “Do not meet,” said he, “in any single brave"
13825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The man thou threaten’st, but in press; and in thy strength impeach"
13826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His violence; for, far off, or near, his sword or dart will reach.”"
13827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The God’s voice made a difference in Hector’s own conceit
13828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Betwixt his and Achilles’ words, and gave such over-weight"
13829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As weigh’d him back into his strength, and curb’d his flying out."
13830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At all threw fierce Æacides, and gave a horrid shout."
13831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The first, of all he put to dart, was fierce Iphition,"
13832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Surnam’d Otryntides, whom Nais the water-nymph made son"
13833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To town-destroy’r Otrynteüs. Beneath the snowy hill
13834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Tmolus, in the wealthy town of Hyda, at his will"
13835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were many able men at arms. He, rushing in, took full"
13836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pelides’ lance in his head’s midst, that cleft in two his skull."
13837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles knew him one much fam’d, and thus insulted then:"
13838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Th’ art dead, Otryntides, though call’d the terriblest of men."
13839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy race runs at Gygæus’ lake, there thy inheritance lay,"
13840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Near fishy Hyllus and the gulfs of Hermus; but this day
13841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Removes it to the fields of Troy.” Thus left he night to seize
13842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His closéd eyes, his body laid in course of all the prease,"
13843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which Grecian horse broke with the strakes nail’d to their chariot
13844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,wheels.
13845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Next, through the temples, the burst eyes his deadly jav’lin seels"
13846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of great-in-Troy Antenor’s son, renown’d Demoleon,"
13847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A mighty turner of a field. His overthrow set gone
13848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hippodamas; who leap’d from horse, and, as he fled before"
13849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Æacides’s turnéd back, he made fell Pelias gore,"
13850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And forth he puff’d his flying soul. And as a tortur’d bull,"
13851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Neptune brought for sacrifice, a troop of youngsters pull"
13852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down to the earth, and drag him round about the hallow’d shore,"
13853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To please the wat’ry Deity with forcing him to roar,"
13854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And forth he pours his utmost throat; so bellow’d this slain friend
13855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of flying Ilion, with the breath that gave his being end."
13856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then rush’d he on, and in his eye had heav’nly Polydore,"
13857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Old Priam’s son, whom last of all his fruitful princess bore,"
13858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And for his youth, being dear to him, the king forbad to fight."
13859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet (hot of unexperienc’d blood, to show how exquisite"
13860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He was of foot, for which of all the fifty sons he held"
13861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The special name) he flew before the first heat of the field,"
13862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n till he flew out breath and soul; which, through the back, the"
13863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,lance
13864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of swift Achilles put in air, and did his head advance"
13865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out at his navel. On his knees the poor prince crying fell,"
13866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And gather’d with his tender hands his entrails, that did swell"
13867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Quite through the wide wound, till a cloud as black as death conceal’d"
13868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their sight, and all the world from him. When Hector had beheld"
13869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His brother tumbled so to earth, his entrails still in hand,"
13870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Dark sorrow overcast his eyes; nor far off could he stand
13871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A minute longer, but like fire he brake out of the throng,"
13872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Shook his long lance at Thetis’ son; and then came he along
13873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To feed th’ encounter: “O,” said he, “here comes the man that most"
13874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the world destroys my mind, the man by whom I lost"
13875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My dear Patroclus. Now not long the crooked paths of war
13876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Can yield us any privy scapes. ‘Come, keep not off so far,’"
13877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He cried to Hector, ‘make the pain of thy sure death as short,"
13878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As one so desp’rate of his life hath reason.’” In no sort
13879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This frighted Hector, who bore close, and said: “Æacides,"
13880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Leave threats for children. I have pow’r to thunder calumnies
13881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As well as others, and well know thy strength superior far"
13882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To that my nerves hold; but the Gods, not nerves, determine war."
13883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet, for nerves, there will be found a strength of pow’r in mine"
13884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To drive a lance home to thy life. My lance as well as thine
13885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath point and sharpness, and ’tis this.” Thus brandishing his spear,"
13886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He set it flying; which a breath of Pallas back did bear
13887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Thetis’ son to Hector’s self, and at his feet it fell."
13888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles us’d no dart, but close flew in; and thought to deal"
13889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With no strokes but of sure dispatch, but, what with all his blood"
13890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He labour’d, Phœbus clear’d with ease, as being a God, and stood"
13891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Hector’s guard, as Pallas did, Æacides, for thine."
13892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He rapt him from him, and a cloud of much night cast between"
13893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His person and the point oppos’d. Achilles then exclaim’d:
13894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O see, yet more Gods are at work. Apollo’s hand hath fram’d,"
13895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dog that thou art, thy rescue now; to whom go pay thy vows"
13896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy safety owes him, I shall vent in time those fatal blows"
13897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That yet beat in my heart on thine, if any God remain"
13898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My equal fautor. In mean time, my anger must maintain"
13899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His fire on other Ilians.” Then laid he at his feet
13900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Demuchus, Philetor’s son; and Dryope did greet"
13901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With like encounter. Dardanus and strong Laogonus,"
13902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wise Bias’ sons, he hurl’d from horse; of one victorious"
13903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his close sword, the other’s life he conquer’d with his lance."
13904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Tros, Alastor’s son, made in, and sought to scape their chance"
13905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With free submission. Down he fell, and pray’d about his knees"
13906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He would not kill him, but take ruth, as one that destinies"
13907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made to that purpose, being a man born in the self same year"
13908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That he himself was. O poor fool, to sue to him to bear"
13909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A ruthful mind! He well might know, he could not fashion him"
13910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In ruth’s soft mould, he had no spirit to brook that interim"
13911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his hot fury, he was none of these remorseful men,"
13912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gentle and affable, but fierce at all times, and mad then."
13913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He gladly would have made a pray’r, and still so hugg’d his knee"
13914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He could not quit him; till at last his sword was fain to free
13915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fetter’d knees, that made a vent for his white liver’s blood"
13916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That caus’d such pitiful affects; of which it pour’d a flood
13917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About his bosom, which it fill’d, ev’n till it drown’d his eyes,"
13918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all sense fail’d him. Forth then flew this prince of tragedies;
13919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Who next stoop’d Mulius ev’n to death with his insatiate spear;
13920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One ear it enter’d, and made good his pass to th’ other ear."
13921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Echeclus then, Agenor’s son, he strook betwixt the brows;"
13922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose blood set fire upon his sword, that cool’d it till the throes"
13923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his then labouring brain let out his soul to fixéd fate,"
13924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And gave cold entry to black death. Deucalion then had state
13925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In these men’s beings, where the nerves about the elbow knit,"
13926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down to his hand his spear’s steel pierc’d, and brought such pain to it"
13927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As led death jointly; whom he saw before his fainting eyes,"
13928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in his neck felt, with a stroke, laid on so, that off flies"
13929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His head. One of the twice-twelve bones, that all the backbone make,"
13930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let out his marrow; when the head he, helm and all, did take,"
13931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And hurl’d amongst the Ilians; the body stretch’d on earth.
13932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rhigmus of fruitful Thrace next fell. He was the famous birth
13933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Pireüs; his belly’s midst the lance took, whose stern force"
13934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Quite tumbled him from chariot. In turning back the horse,"
13935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their guider Areithous receiv’d another lance
13936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That threw him to his lord. No end was put to the mischance
13937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles enter’d. But as fire, fall’n in a flash from heav’n,"
13938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Inflames the high woods of dry hills, and with a storm is driv’n"
13939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Through all the sylvan deeps; and raves, till down goes ev’rywhere"
13940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The smother’d hill; so ev’ry way Achilles and his spear
13941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Consum’d the champain, the black earth flow’d with the veins he tore."
13942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And look how oxen, yok’d and driv’n about the circular floor"
13943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of some fair barn, tread suddenly the thick sheaves thin of corn,"
13944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all the corn consum’d with chaff; so mix’d and overborne,"
13945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath Achilles’ one-hoof’d horse, shields, spears, and men, lay trod,"
13946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His axle-trees and chariot wheels, all spatter’d with the blood"
13947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hurl’d from the steeds’ hooves and the strakes. Thus, to be magnified,"
13948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His most inaccessible hands in human blood he dyed.

13973,THE ARGUMENT,That Troy in safety might her friends receive.
13974,THE ARGUMENT,
13975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,ANOTHER ARGUMENT
13976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
13977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
13978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Phy at the flood’s shore doth express
13979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The labours of Æacides.
13980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
13981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
13982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now they reach’d the goodly swelling channel of the flood,"
13983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gulf-eating Xanthus, whom Jove mix’d with his immortal brood;"
13984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And there Achilles cleft the host of Ilion; one side fell
13985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On Xanthus, th’ other on the town; and that did he impell"
13986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The same way that the last day’s rage put all the Greeks in rout,"
13987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When Hector’s fury reign’d; these now Achilles pour’d about
13988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The scatter’d field. To stay the flight, Saturnia cast before"
13989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their hasty feet a standing fog; and then flight’s violence bore
13990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The other half full on the flood. The silver-gulféd deep
13991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Receiv’d them with a mighty cry, the billows vast and steep"
13992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Roar’d at their armours, which the shores did round about resound;"
13993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This way and that they swum, and shriek’d as in the gulfs they drown’d"
13994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as in fir’d fields locusts rise, as the unwearied blaze"
13995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Plies still their rising, till in swarms all rush as in amaze,"
13996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For scape into some neighbour flood; so th’ Achilleian stroke
13997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Here drave the foe, the gulfy flood with men and horse did choke."
13998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then on the shore the Worthy hid and left his horrid lance
13999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amids the tamarisks, and sprite-like did with his sword advance"
14000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up to the river; ill affairs took up his furious brain
14001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For Troy’s engagements; ev’ry way he doubled slain on slain.
14002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A most unmanly noise was made, with those he put to sword,"
14003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of groans and outcries. The flood blush’d, to be so much engor’d"
14004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With such base souls. And as small fish the swift-finn’d dolphin fly,"
14005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Filling the deep pits in the ports, on whose close strength they lie,"
14006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And there he swallows them in shoals; so here, to rocks and holes"
14007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the flood, the Trojans fled, and there most lost their souls,"
14008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n till he tir’d his slaught’rous arm. Twelve fair young princes then
14009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He chose of all to take alive, to have them freshly slain"
14010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On that most solemn day of wreak, resolv’d on for his friend."
14011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These led he trembling forth the flood, as fearful of their end"
14012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As any hind calves. All their hands he pinioned behind
14013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With their own girdles worn upon their rich weeds, and resign’d"
14014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their persons to his Myrmidons to bear to fleet; and he
14015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Plung’d in the stream again to take more work of tragedy.
14016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He met, then issuing the flood with all intent of flight,"
14017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lycaon, Dardan Priam’s son; whom lately in the night"
14018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He had surpris’d, as in a wood of Priam’s he had cut"
14019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The green arms of a wild fig-tree, to make him spokes to put"
14020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In naves of his new chariot. An ill then, all unthought,"
14021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stole on him in Achilles’ shape, who took him thence, and brought"
14022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To well-built Lemnos, selling him to famous Jason’s son."
14023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From whom a guest then in his house (Imbrius Eetion)
14024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Redeem’d at high rate, and sent home t’ Arisba, whence he fled,"
14025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And saw again his father’s court; elev’n days banqueted
14026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst his friends; the twelfth God thrust his hapless head again
14027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In t’ hands of stern Æacides, who now must send him slain"
14028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Pluto’s court, and ’gainst his will. Him, when Achilles knew,"
14029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Naked of helmet, shield, sword, lance (all which for ease he threw"
14030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To earth, being overcome with sweat, and labour wearying"
14031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His flying knees) he storm’d, and said: “O heav’n, a wondrous thing"
14032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Invades mine eyes! Those Ilians, that heretofore I slew,"
14033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rise from the dark dead quick again. This man Fate makes eschew
14034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her own steel fingers. He was sold in Lemnos, and the deep"
14035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all seas ’twixt this Troy, and that (that many a man doth keep"
14036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From his lov’d country) bars not him. Come then, he now shall taste"
14037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The head of Pelias, and try if steel will down as fast"
14038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As other fortunes, or kind earth can any surer seize"
14039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his sly person, whose strong arms have held down Hercules.”"
14040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His thoughts thus mov’d, while he stood firm, to see if he, he spied,"
14041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would offer flight (which first he thought) but when he had descried
14042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He was descried and flight was vain, fearful, he made more nigh,"
14043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With purpose to embrace his knees, and now long’d much to fly"
14044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His black fate and abhorréd death by coming in. His foe
14045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Observ’d all this, and up he rais’d his lance as he would throw;"
14046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then Lycaon close ran in, fell on his breast, and took"
14047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles’ knees; whose lance, on earth now staid, did overlook"
14048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His still turn’d back, with thirst to glut his sharp point with the"
14049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,blood
14050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That lay so ready. But that thirst Lycaon’s thirst withstood
14051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To save his blood; Achilles’ knee in his one hand he knit,"
14052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His other held the long lance hard, and would not part with it,"
14053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thus besought: “I kiss thy knees, divine Æacides!"
14054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Respect me, and my fortunes rue. I now present th’ access"
14055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of a poor suppliant for thy ruth; and I am one that is
14056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Worthy thy ruth, O Jove’s belov’d. First hour my miseries"
14057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fell into any hand, ’twas thine. I tasted all my bread"
14058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By thy gift since, O since that hour that thy surprisal led"
14059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From forth the fair wood my sad feet, far from my lov’d allies,"
14060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To famous Lemnos, where I found a hundred oxen’s prize"
14061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To make my ransom; for which now I thrice the worth will raise.
14062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This day makes twelve, since I arriv’d in Ilion, many days"
14063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Being spent before in sufferance; and now a cruel fate
14064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrusts me again into thy hands. I should haunt Jove with hate,"
14065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That with such set malignity gives thee my life again.
14066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There were but two of us for whom Laothoe suffer’d pain,"
14067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laothoe, old Alte’s seed; Alte, whose palace stood"
14068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In height of upper Pedasus, near Satnius’ silver flood,"
14069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And rul’d the war-like Lelegi. Whose seed (as many more)
14070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"King Priam married, and begot the god-like Polydore,"
14071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And me accurs’d. Thou slaughter’dst him; and now thy hand on me
14072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will prove as mortal. I did think, when here I met with thee,"
14073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I could not ’scape thee; yet give ear, and add thy mind to it:"
14074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I told my birth to intimate, though one sire did beget"
14075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet one womb brought not into light Hector that slew thy friend,"
14076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And me. O do not kill me then, but let the wretched end"
14077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Polydore excuse my life. For half our being bred
14078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brothers to Hector, he (half) paid, no more is forfeited.”"
14079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus sued he humbly; but he heard, with this austere reply:"
14080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Fool, urge not ruth nor price to me, till that solemnity,"
14081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Resolv’d on for Patroclus’ death, pay all his rites to fate."
14082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till his death I did grace to Troy, and many lives did rate"
14083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At price of ransom; but none now, of all the brood of Troy,"
14084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Whoever Jove throws to my hands) shall any breath enjoy
14085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That death can beat out, specially that touch at Priam’s race."
14086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Die, die, my friend. What tears are these? What sad looks spoil thy"
14087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,face?
14088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus died, that far pass’d thee. Nay, seest thou not beside,"
14089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Myself, ev’n I, a fair young man, and rarely magnified,"
14090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, to my father being a king, a mother have that sits"
14091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In rank with Goddesses; and yet, when thou hast spent thy spirits,"
14092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Death and as violent a fate must overtake ev’n me,"
14093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By twilight, morn-light, day, high noon, whenever destiny"
14094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sets on her man to hurl a lance, or knit out of his string"
14095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"An arrow that must reach my life.” This said, a languishing"
14096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lycaon’s heart bent like his knees, yet left him strength t’ advance"
14097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both hands for mercy as he kneel’d. His foe yet leaves his lance,"
14098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And forth his sword flies, which he hid in furrow of a wound"
14099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Driv’n through the jointure of his neck; flat fell he on the ground,"
14100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stretch’d with death’s pangs, and all the earth imbru’d with timeless"
14101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,blood.
14102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then gript Æacides his heel, and to the lofty flood"
14103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flung, swinging, his unpitied corse, to see it swim, and toss"
14104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon the rough waves, and said; “Go, feed fat the fish with loss"
14105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of thy left blood, they clean will suck thy green wounds; and this"
14106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,saves
14107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy mother tears upon thy bed. Deep Xanthus on his waves
14108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall hoise thee bravely to a tomb, that in her burly breast"
14109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sea shall open, where great fish may keep thy fun’ral feast"
14110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With thy white fat, and on the waves dance at thy wedding fate,"
14111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Clad in black horror, keeping close inaccessible state,"
14112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So perish Ilians, till we pluck the brows of Ilion"
14113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down to her feet, you flying still, I flying still upon"
14114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus in the rear, and (as my brows were fork’d with rabid horns)[1]"
14115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Toss ye together. This brave flood, that strengthens and adorns"
14116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your city with his silver gulfs, to whom so many bulls"
14117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your zeal hath offer’d, which blind zeal his sacred current gulls,"
14118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With casting chariots and horse quick to his pray’d-for aid,"
14119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall nothing profit. Perish then, till cruell’st death hath laid"
14120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All at the red feet of Revenge for my slain friend, and all"
14121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With whom the absence of my hands made yours a festival.”
14122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This speech great Xanthus more enrag’d, and made his spirit contend"
14123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For means to shut up the op’d vein against him, and defend"
14124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojans in it from his plague. In mean time Peleus’ son,"
14125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now with that long lance he hid, for more blood set upon"
14126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Asteropæus, the descent of Pelegon, and he"
14127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of broad-stream’d Axius, and the dame, of first nativity"
14128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all the daughters that renown’d Acesamenus’ seed,"
14129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bright Peribœa, whom the Flood, arm’d thick with lofty reed,"
14130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Compress’d. At her grandchild now went Thetis’ great son, whose foe"
14131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood arm’d with two darts, being set on by Xanthus anger’d so"
14132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For those youths’ blood shed in his stream by vengeful Thetis’ son
14133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without all mercy. Both being near, great Thetides begun"
14134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With this high question; “Of what race art thou that dar’st oppose
14135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy pow’r to mine thus? Curséd wombs they ever did disclose,"
14136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That stood my anger.” He replied: “What makes thy fury’s heat
14137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Talk, and seek pedigrees? Far hence lies my innative seat,"
14138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In rich Pæonia. My race from broad-stream’d Axius runs;
14139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Axius, that gives earth purest drink, of all the wat’ry sons"
14140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of great Oceanus, and got the famous for his spear,"
14141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pelegonus, that father’d me; and these Pæonians here,"
14142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arm’d with long lances, here I lead; and here th’ elev’nth fair light"
14143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shines on us since we enter’d Troy. Come now, brave man, let’s fight.”"
14144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus spake he, threat’ning; and to him Pelides made reply"
14145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With shaken Pelias; but his foe with two at once let fly,"
14146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For both his hands were dexterous. One jav’lin strook the shield
14147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Thetis’ son, but strook not through; the gold, God’s gift, repell’d"
14148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The eager point; the other lance fell lightly on the part
14149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his fair right hand’s cubit; forth the black blood spun; the dart
14150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Glanc’d over, fast’ning on the earth, and there his spleen was spent"
14151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That wish’d the body. With which wish Achilles his lance sent,"
14152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That quite miss’d, and infix’d itself fast in steep-up shore;"
14153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n to the midst it enter’d it. Himself then fiercely bore
14154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon his enemy with his sword. His foe was tugging hard
14155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To get his lance out; thrice he pluck’d, and thrice sure Pelias barr’d"
14156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wish’d evulsion; the fourth pluck, he bow’d and meant to break"
14157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ashen plant, but, ere that act, Achilles’ sword did check"
14158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His bent pow’r, and brake out his soul. Full in the navel-stead"
14159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He ripp’d his belly up, and out his entrails fell, and dead"
14160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His breathless body; whence his arms Achilles drew, and said:"
14161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Lie there, and prove it dangerous to lift up adverse head"
14162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against Jove’s sons, although a Flood were ancestor to thee."
14163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy vaunts urg’d him, but I may vaunt a higher pedigree"
14164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Jove himself. King Peleüs was son to Æacus,"
14165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Infernal Æacus to Jove, and I to Peleüs."
14166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thunder-voic’d Jove far passeth floods, that only murmurs raise"
14167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With earth and water as they run with tribute to the seas;
14168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And his seed theirs exceeds as far. A Flood, a mighty Flood,"
14169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rag’d near thee now, but with no aid; Jove must not be withstood."
14170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"King Achelous yields to him, and great Oceanus,"
14171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whence all floods, all the sea, all founts, wells, all deeps humorous,"
14172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fetch their beginnings; yet ev’n he fears Jove’s flash, and the crack"
14173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His thunder gives, when out of heav’n it tears atwo his rack.”[2]"
14174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus pluck’d he from the shore his lance, and left the waves to wash"
14175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wave-sprung entrails, about which fausens and other fish"
14176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Did shoal, to nibble at the fat which his sweet kidneys hid."
14177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This for himself. Now to his men, the well-rode Pæons, did"
14178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His rage contend, all which cold fear shook into flight, to see"
14179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their captain slain. At whose maz’d flight, as much enrag’d, flew he."
14180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then fell all these, Thrasius, Mydon, Astypylus,"
14181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Ophelestes, Ænius, Mnesus, Thersilochus."
14182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And on these many more had fall’n, unless the angry Flood"
14183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had took the figure of a man, and in a whirlpit stood,"
14184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus speaking to Æacides: “Past all, pow’r feeds thy will,"
14185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou great grandchild of Æacus, and, past all, th’ art in ill,"
14186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Gods themselves confederates, and Jove, the best of Gods,"
14187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All deaths gives thee, all places not. Make my shores periods"
14188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all shore service. In the field let thy field-acts run high,"
14189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not in my waters. My sweet streams choke with mortality
14190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of men slain by thee. Carcasses so glut me, that I fail"
14191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To pour into the sacred sea my waves; yet still assail
14192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy cruel forces. Cease, amaze affects me with thy rage,"
14193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prince of the people.” He replied: “Shall thy command assuage,"
14194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gulf-fed Scamander, my free wrath? I’ll never leave pursu’d"
14195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Proud Ilion’s slaughters, till this hand in her fill’d walls conclude"
14196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her flying forces, and hath tried in single fight the chance"
14197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of war with Hector; whose event with stark death shall advance
14198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,One of our conquests.” Thus again he like a fury flew
14199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon the Trojans; when the flood his sad plaint did pursue
14200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To bright Apollo, telling him he was too negligent"
14201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Jove’s high charge, importuning by all means vehement"
14202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His help of Troy till latest even should her black shadows pour
14203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On Earth’s broad breast. In all his worst, Achilles yet from shore"
14204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Leapt to his midst. Then swell’d his waves, then rag’d, then boil’d"
14205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,again
14206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against Achilles. Up flew all, and all the bodies slain"
14207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In all his deeps (of which the heaps made bridges to his waves)
14208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He belch’d out, roaring like a bull. The unslain yet he saves"
14209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In his black whirlpits vast and deep. A horrid billow stood
14210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About Achilles. On his shield the violence of the Flood
14211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beat so, it drave him back, and took his feet up, his fair palm"
14212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enforc’d to catch into his stay a broad and lofty elm,"
14213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose roots he toss’d up with his hold, and tore up all the shore."
14214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With this then he repell’d the waves, and those thick arms it bore"
14215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He made a bridge to bear him off; (for all fell in) when he
14216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Forth from the channel threw himself. The rage did terrify[3]
14217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n his great spirit, and made him add wings to his swiftest feet,"
14218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And tread the land. And yet not there the Flood left his retreat,"
14219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But thrust his billows after him, and black’d them all at top,"
14220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make him fear, and fly his charge, and set the broad field ope"
14221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For Troy to ’scape in. He sprung out a dart’s cast, but came on"
14222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Again with a redoubled force. As when the swiftest flown,"
14223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And strong’st of all fowls, Jove’s black hawk, the huntress, stoops"
14224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,upon
14225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A much lov’d quarry; so charg’d he; his arms with horror rung
14226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against the black waves. Yet again he was so urg’d, he flung"
14227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His body from the Flood, and fled; and after him again"
14228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The waves flew roaring. As a man that finds a water-vein,"
14229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And from some black fount is to bring his streams through plants and
14230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"groves,"
14231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Goes with his mattock, and all checks, set to his course, removes;"
14232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When that runs freely, under it the pebbles all give way,"
14233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, where it finds a fall, runs swift; nor can the leader stay"
14234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His current then, before himself full-pac’d it murmurs on;"
14235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So of Achilles evermore the strong Flood vantage won;
14236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though most deliver, Gods are still above the pow’rs of men."
14237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As oft as th’ able god-like man endeavour’d to maintain
14238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His charge on them that kept the flood, and charg’d as he would try"
14239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If all the Gods inhabiting the broad unreachéd sky
14240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Could daunt his spirit; so oft still, the rude waves charg’d him round,"
14241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Rampt on his shoulders; from whose depth his strength and spirit would
14242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,bound
14243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the free air, vex’d in soul. And now the vehement Flood"
14244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made faint his knees; so overthwart his waves were, they withstood"
14245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All the denied dust, which he wish’d, and now was fain to cry,"
14246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Casting his eyes to that broad heav’n, that late he long’d to try,"
14247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “O Jove, how am I left! No God vouchsafes to free"
14248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Me, miserable man. Help now, and after torture me"
14249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With any outrage. Would to heaven, Hector, the mightiest"
14250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bred in this region, had imbru’d his jav’lin in my breast,"
14251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That strong may fall by strong! Where now weak water’s luxury
14252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must make my death blush, one, heav’n-born, shall like a hog-herd die,"
14253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Drown’d in a dirty torrent’s rage. Yet none of you in heav’n
14254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I blame for this, but She alone by whom this life was giv’n"
14255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That now must die thus. She would still delude me with her tales,"
14256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Affirming Phœbus’ shafts should end within the Trojan walls
14257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My curs’d beginning.” In this strait, Neptune and Pallas flew,"
14258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fetch him off. In men’s shapes both close to his danger drew,"
14259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, taking both both hands, thus spake the Shaker of the world:"
14260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Pelides, do not stir a foot, nor these waves, proudly curl’d"
14261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against thy bold breast, fear a jot; thou hast us two thy friends,"
14262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Neptune and Pallas, Jove himself approving th’ aid we lend."
14263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,’Tis nothing as thou fear’st with Fate; she will not see thee drown’d.
14264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This height shall soon down, thine own eyes shall see it set aground."
14265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be rul’d then, we’ll advise thee well; take not thy hand away"
14266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From putting all, indiff’rently, to all that it can lay"
14267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon the Trojans, till the walls of haughty Ilion"
14268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Conclude all in a desp’rate flight. And when thou hast set gone
14269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The soul of Hector, turn to fleet; our hands shall plant a wreath"
14270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of endless glory on thy brows.” Thus to the free from death
14271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both made retreat. He, much impell’d by charge the Godheads gave,"
14272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The field, that now was overcome with many a boundless wave,"
14273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He overcame. On their wild breasts they toss’d the carcasses,"
14274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And arms, of many a slaughter’d man. And now the wingéd knees"
14275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of this great captain bore aloft; against the Flood he flies
14276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With full assault; nor could that God make shrink his rescu’d thighs.
14277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor shrunk the Flood, but, as his foe grew pow’rful, he grew mad,"
14278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thrust up a billow to the sky, and crystal Simoïs bad"
14279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his assistance: “Simoïs, ho, brother,” out he cried,"
14280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Come, add thy current, and resist this man half-deified,"
14281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or Ilion he will pull down straight; the Trojans cannot stand
14282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A minute longer. Come, assist, and instantly command"
14283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All fountains in thy rule to rise, all torrents to make in,"
14284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And stuff thy billows; with whose height, engender such a din,"
14285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With trees torn up and justling stones, as so immane a man"
14286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,May shrink beneath us; whose pow’r thrives do my pow’r all it can;
14287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He dares things fitter for a God. But, nor his form, nor force,"
14288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor glorious arms shall profit it; all which, and his dead corse,"
14289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I vow to roll up in my sands, nay, bury in my mud,"
14290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nay, in the very sinks of Troy, that, pour’d into my flood,"
14291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall make him drowning work enough; and, being drown’d, I’ll set"
14292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A fort of such strong filth on him, that Greece shall never get"
14293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His bones from it. There, there shall stand Achilles’ sepulchre,"
14294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And save a burial for his friends.” This fury did transfer
14295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His high-ridg’d billows on the prince, roaring with blood and foam"
14296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And carcasses. The crimson stream did snatch into her womb
14297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Surpris’d Achilles; and her height stood, held up by the hand"
14298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Jove himself. Then Juno cried, and call’d (to countermand"
14299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This wat’ry Deity) the God that holds command in fire,"
14300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Afraid lest that gulf-stomach’d Flood would satiate his desire
14301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On great Achilles: “Mulciber, my best lov’d son!” she cried,"
14302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Rouse thee, for all the Gods conceive this Flood thus amplified"
14303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is rais’d at thee, and shows as if his waves would drown the sky,"
14304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And put out all the sphere of fire. Haste, help thy empery."
14305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Light flames deep as his pits. Ourself the west wind and the south
14306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will call out of the sea, and breathe in either’s full-charg’d mouth"
14307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A storm t’ enrage thy fires ’gainst Troy; which shall (in one exhal’d)
14308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Blow flames of sweat about their brows, and make their armours scald."
14309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Go thou then, and, ’gainst these winds rise, make work on Xanthus’"
14310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"shore,"
14311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With setting all his trees on fire, and in his own breast pour"
14312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A fervor that shall make it burn; nor let fair words or threats
14313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Avert thy fury till I speak, and then subdue the heats"
14314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all thy blazes.” Mulciber prepar’d a mighty fire,"
14315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,First in the field us’d; burning up the bodies that the ire
14316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of great Achilles reft of souls; the quite-drown’d field it dried,"
14317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And shrunk the flood up. And as fields, that have been long time cloy’d"
14318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With catching weather, when their corn lies on the gavel heap,"
14319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are with a constant north wind dried, with which for comfort leap"
14320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their hearts that sow’d them; so this field was dried, the bodies"
14321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"burn’d,"
14322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ev’n the flood into a fire as bright as day was turn’d.
14323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Elms, willows, tam’risks, were inflam’d; the lote trees, sea-grass"
14324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"reeds,"
14325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And rushes, with the galingale roots, of which abundance breeds"
14326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About the sweet flood, all were fir’d; the gliding fishes flew"
14327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upwards in flames; the grov’lling eels crept upright; all which slew
14328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wise Vulcan’s unresisted spirit. The Flood out of a flame
14329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cried to him: “Cease, O Mulciber, no Deity can tame"
14330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy matchless virtue; nor would I, since thou art thus hot, strive."
14331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cease then thy strife; let Thetis’ son, with all thy wish’d haste,"
14332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,drive
14333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n to their gates these Ilians. What toucheth me their aid,"
14334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or this contention?” Thus in flames the burning River pray’d.
14335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as a caldron, underput with store of fire, and wrought"
14336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With boiling of a well-fed brawn, up leaps his wave aloft,"
14337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bavins of sere wood urging it, and spending flames apace,"
14338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Till all the caldron be engirt with a consuming blaze;
14339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So round this Flood burn’d, and so sod his sweet and tortur’d streams,"
14340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor could flow forth, bound in the fumes of Vulcan’s fi’ry beams;"
14341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who, then not mov’d, his mother’s ruth by all his means he craves,"
14342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ask’d, why Vulcan should invade and so torment his waves"
14343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Past other floods, when his offence rose not to such degree"
14344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As that of other Gods for Troy; and that himself would free
14345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her wrath to it, if she were pleas’d; and pray’d her, that her son"
14346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Might be reflected; adding this, that he would ne’er be won"
14347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To help keep off the ruinous day, in which all Troy should burn,"
14348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fir’d by the Grecians. This vow heard, she charg’d her son to turn"
14349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fi’ry spirits to their homes, and said it was not fit"
14350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A God should suffer so for men. Then Vulcan did remit
14351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His so unmeasur’d violence, and back the pleasant Flood"
14352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ran to his channel. Thus these Gods she made friends; th’ other stood
14353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At weighty diff’rence; both sides ran together with a sound,"
14354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That earth resounded, and great heav’n about did surrebound,"
14355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove heard it, sitting on his hill, and laugh’d to see the Gods"
14356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Buckle to arms like angry men; and, he pleas’d with their odds,"
14357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They laid it freely. Of them all, thump-buckler Mars began,"
14358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And at Minerva with a lance of brass he headlong ran,"
14359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These vile words ushering his blows: “Thou dog-fly, what’s the cause"
14360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thou mak’st Gods fight thus? Thy huge heart breaks all our peaceful
14361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,laws
14362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With thy insatiate shamelessness, Rememb’rest thou the hour"
14363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Diomed charg’d me, and by thee, and thou with all thy pow’r"
14364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took’st lance thyself, and, in all sights, rush’d on me with a wound?"
14365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now vengeance falls on thee for all.” This said, the shield fring’d"
14366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,round
14367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With fighting adders, borne by Jove, that not to thunder yields,"
14368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He clapt his lance on; and this God, that with the blood of fields"
14369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pollutes his godhead, that shield pierc’d, and hurt the arméd Maid,"
14370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But back she leapt, and with her strong hand rapt a huge stone, laid"
14371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Above the champain, black and sharp, that did in old time break"
14372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Partitions to men’s lands; and that she dusted in the neck
14373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of that impetuous challenger. Down to the earth he sway’d,"
14374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And overlaid sev’n acres’ land. His hair was all beray’d
14375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With dust and blood mix’d; and his arms rung out. Minerva laugh’d,"
14376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus insulted: “O thou fool, yet hast thou not been taught"
14377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To know mine eminence? Thy strength opposest thou to mine?
14378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So pay thy mother’s furies then, who for these aids of thine,"
14379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Ever afforded perjur’d Troy, Greece ever left) takes spleen,"
14380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And vows thee mischief.” Thus she turn’d her blue eyes, when love’s"
14381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Queen
14382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hand of Mars took, and from earth rais’d him with thick-drawn"
14383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"breath,"
14384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His spirits not yet got up again. But from the press of death
14385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Kind Aphrodite was his guide. Which Juno seeing, exclaim’d:"
14386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Pallas, see, Mars is help’d from field! Dog-fly, his rude tongue nam’d"
14387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thyself ev’n now; but that his love, that dog-fly, will not leave"
14388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her old consort. Upon her fly.” Minerva did receive
14389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This excitation joyfully, and at the Cyprian flew,"
14390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strook with her hard hand her soft breast, a blow that overthrew"
14391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Both her and Mars; and there both lay together in broad field.
14392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When thus she triumph’d: “So lie all, that any succours yield"
14393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To these false Trojans ’gainst the Greeks; so bold and patient
14394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As Venus, shunning charge of me; and no less impotent"
14395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Be all their aids, than hers to Mars. So short work would be made"
14396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In our depopulating Troy, this hardiest to invade"
14397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all earth’s cities.” At this wish, white-wristed Juno smil’d."
14398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Next Neptune and Apollo stood upon the point of field,"
14399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus spake Neptune: “Phœbus! Come, why at the lance’s end"
14400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stand we two thus? ’Twill be a shame, for us to re-ascend"
14401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove’s golden house, being thus in field and not to fight. Begin;"
14402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For ’tis no graceful work for me; thou hast the younger chin,"
14403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I older and know more. O fool, what a forgetful heart"
14404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou bear’st about thee, to stand here, prest to take th’ Ilian part,"
14405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And fight with me! Forgett’st thou then, what we two, we alone"
14406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Gods, have suffer’d here, when proud Laomedon"
14407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enjoy’d our service a whole year, for our agreed reward?"
14408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Jove in his sway would have it so; and in that year I rear’d
14409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This broad brave wall about this town, that (being a work of mine)"
14410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It might be inexpugnable. This service then was thine,"
14411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Ida, that so many hills and curl’d-head forests crown,"
14412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To feed his oxen, crooked-shank’d, and headed like the moon."
14413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when the much-joy-bringing Hours brought term for our reward,"
14414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The terrible Laomedon dismiss’d us both, and scar’d"
14415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our high deservings, not alone to hold our promis’d fee,"
14416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But give us threats too. Hands and feet he swore to fetter thee,"
14417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And sell thee as a slave, dismiss’d far hence to foreign isles."
14418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nay more, he would have both our ears. His vow’s breach, and reviles,"
14419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Made us part angry with him then; and dost thou gratulate now
14420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such a king’s subjects? Or with us not their destruction vow,"
14421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n to their chaste wives and their babes?” He answer’d: “He might
14422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"hold,"
14423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wisdom little, if with him, a God, for men he would"
14424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Maintain contention; wretched men that flourish for a time
14425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like leaves, eat some of that earth yields, and give earth in their"
14426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,prime
14427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their whole selves for it. Quickly then, let us fly fight for them,"
14428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor show it offer’d. Let themselves bear out their own extreme.”
14429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus he retir’d, and fear’d to change blows with his uncle’s hands;"
14430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sister therefore chid him much, the Goddess that commands"
14431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In games of hunting, and thus spake: “Fly’st thou, and leav’st the"
14432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,field
14433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Neptune’s glory, and no blows? O fool, why dost thou wield"
14434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy idle bow? No more my ears shall hear thee vaunt in skies
14435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dares to meet Neptune, but I’ll tell thy coward’s tongue it lies.”"
14436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d nothing; yet Jove’s wife could put on no such reins,"
14437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But spake thus loosely: “How dar’st thou, dog, whom no fear contains,"
14438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Encounter me? ’Twill prove a match of hard conditión.
14439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though the great Lady of the bow and Jove hath set thee down
14440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For lion of thy sex, with gift to slaughter any dame"
14441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy proud will envies; yet some dames will prove th’ had’st better tame
14442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Wild lions upon hills than them. But if this question rests
14443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet under judgment in thy thoughts, and that thy mind contests,"
14444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I’ll make thee know it.” Suddenly with her left hand she catch’d
14445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both Cynthia’s palms, lock’d fingers fast, and with her right she"
14446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,snatch’d
14447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From her fair shoulders her gilt bow, and, laughing, laid it on"
14448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About her ears, and ev’ry way her turnings seiz’d upon,"
14449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till all her arrows scatter’d out, her quiver emptied quite."
14450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as a dove, that, flying a hawk, takes to some rock her flight,"
14451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And in his hollow breasts sits safe, her fate not yet to die;"
14452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So fled she mourning, and her bow left there. Then Mercury"
14453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His opposite thus undertook: “Latona, at no hand"
14454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will I bide combat. ’Tis a work right dangerous to stand
14455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At diff’rence with the wives of Jove. Go, therefore, freely vaunt"
14456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst the Deities, th’ hast subdu’d, and made thy combatant"
14457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yield with plain pow’r.” She answer’d not, but gather’d up the bow"
14458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And shafts fall’n from her daughter’s side, retiring. Up did go"
14459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Diana to Jove’s starry hall, her incorrupted veil"
14460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Trembling about her so she shook. Phœbus, lest Troy should fail"
14461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before her fate, flew to her walls; the other Deities flew"
14462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to Olympus, some enrag’d, some glad. Achilles slew"
14463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Both men and horse of Ilion. And as a city fir’d
14464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Casts up a heat that purples heav’n, clamours and shrieks expir’d"
14465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In ev’ry corner, toil to all, to many misery,"
14466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Which fire th’ incenséd Gods let fall; Achilles so let fly
14467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rage on the Trojans, toils and shrieks as much by him impos’d."
14468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Old Priam in his sacred tow’r stood, and the flight disclos’d"
14469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his forc’d people, all in rout, and not a stroke return’d"
14470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By fled resistance. His eyes saw in what a fury burn’d
14471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The son of Peleüs, and down went weeping from the tow’r"
14472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all the port-guards, and their chiefs told of his flying pow’r."
14473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Commanding th’ op’ning of the ports, but not to let their hands"
14474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stir from them, for Æacides would pour in with his bands."
14475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Destruction comes, O shut them strait, when we are in,” he pray’d,"
14476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“For not our walls I fear will check this violent man.” This said,"
14477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Off lifted they the bars, the ports hal’d open, and they gave"
14478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Safety her entry with the host; which yet they could not save,"
14479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had not Apollo sallied out, and strook destructión,"
14480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brought by Achilles in their necks, back; when they right upon"
14481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ports bore all, dry, dusty, spent; and on their shoulders rode"
14482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rabid Achilles with his lance, still glory being the goad"
14483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That prick’d his fury. Then the Greeks high-ported Ilion
14484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had seiz’d, had not Apollo stirr’d Antenor’s famous son,"
14485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Agenor, and cast in an undertaking spirit"
14486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his bold bosom, and himself stood by to strengthen it,"
14487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And keep the heavy hand of death from breaking in. The God
14488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood by him, leaning on a beech, and cover’d his abode."
14489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With night-like darkness; yet for all the spirit he inspir’d,"
14490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When that great city-razer’s force his thoughts strook, he retir’d,"
14491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood, and went on; a world of doubts still falling in his way;"
14492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, angry with himself, he said: “Why suffer I this stay"
14493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this so strong need to go on? If, like the rest, I fly,"
14494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Tis his best weapon to give chace, being swift, and I should die"
14495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like to a coward. If I stand, I fall too. These two ways"
14496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Please not my purpose; I would live. What if I suffer these
14497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still to be routed, and, my feet affording further length,"
14498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pass all these fields of Ilion, till Ida’s sylvan strength"
14499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And steep heights shroud me, and at even refresh me in the flood,"
14500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And turn to Ilion? O my soul? why drown’st thou in the blood
14501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of these discourses? If this course, that talks of further flight,"
14502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I give my feet, his feet more swift have more odds. Get he sight"
14503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of that pass, I pass least; for pace, and length of pace, his thighs"
14504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Will stand out all men. Meet him then; my steel hath faculties
14505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of pow’r to pierce him; his great breast but one soul holds, and that"
14506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Death claims his right in, all men say; but he holds special state"
14507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Jove’s high bounty; that’s past man, that ev’ry way will hold,"
14508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And that serves all men ev’ry way.” This last heart made him bold
14509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To stand Achilles, and stirr’d up a mighty mind to blows."
14510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as a panther, having heard the hounds’ trail, doth disclose"
14511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her freckled forehead, and stares forth from out some deep-grown wood"
14512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To try what strength dares her abroad; and when her fi’ry blood
14513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The hounds have kindled, no quench serves of love to live or fear,"
14514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though strook, though wounded, though quite through she feels the"
14515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"mortal spear,"
14516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But till the man’s close strength she tries, or strows earth with his"
14517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"dart,"
14518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She puts her strength out; so it far’d with brave Agenor’s heart,"
14519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And till Achilles he had prov’d, no thoughts, no deeds, once stirr’d"
14520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fixéd foot. To his broad breast his round shield he preferr’d,"
14521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And up his arm went with his aim, his voice out with this cry:"
14522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Thy hope is too great, Peleus’ son, this day to show thine eye"
14523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Troy’s Ilion at thy foot. O fool! the Greeks with much more woes,"
14524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More than are suffer’d yet, must buy great Ilion’s overthrows."
14525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We are within her many strong, that for our parents’ sakes,"
14526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our wives and children, will save Troy; and thou, though he that makes"
14527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy name so terrible, shalt make a sacrifice to her"
14528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With thine own ruins.” Thus he threw, nor did his jav’lin err,"
14529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But strook his foe’s leg near his knee; the fervent steel did ring
14530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against his tin greaves, and leapt back; the fire’s strong-handed king"
14531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Gave virtue of repulse. And then Æacides assail’d
14532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Agenor; but in vain, Apollo’s pow’r prevail’d,"
14533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And rapt Agenor from his reach; whom quietly he plac’d
14534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without the skirmish, casting mists to save from being chac’d"
14535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His tender’d person; and (he gone) to give his soldiers ’scape,"
14536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Deity turn’d Achilles still, by putting on the shape"
14537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of him he thirsted; evermore he fed his eye, and fled,"
14538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And he with all his knees pursu’d. So cunningly he led,"
14539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That still he would be near his reach, to draw his rage, with hope,"
14540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Far from the conflict; to the flood maintaining still the scope
14541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his attraction. In mean time, the other frighted pow’rs"

14657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And pity her. If ever she had quieted his exclaim,"

14662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being ravish’d from us, Grecian dogs nourish’d with what I nurs’d.”"
14663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus wept both these, and to his ruth propos’d the utmost worst"
14664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of what could chance them; yet he stay’d. And now drew deadly near
14665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Mighty Achilles; yet he still kept deadly station there.
14666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Look how a dragon, when she sees a traveller bent upon"
14667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her breeding den, her bosom fed with full contagión,"
14668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gathers her forces, sits him firm, and at his nearest pace"
14669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wraps all her cavern in her folds, and thrusts a horrid face"
14670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out at his entry; Hector so, with unextinguish’d spirit,"
14671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood great Achilles, stirr’d no foot, but at the prominent turret"
14672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bent to his bright shield, and resolv’d to bear fall’n heav’n on it."
14673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet all this resolute abode did not so truly fit
14674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His free election; but he felt a much more galling spur
14675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To the performance, with conceit of what he should incur"
14676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ent’ring, like others, for this cause; to which he thus gave way:"
14677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O me, if I shall take the town, Polydamas will lay"
14678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This flight and all this death on me; who counsell’d me to lead
14679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My pow’rs to Troy this last black night, when so I saw make head"
14680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Incens’d Achilles. I yet stay’d, though, past all doubt, that course"
14681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Had much more profited than mine; which; being by so much worse
14682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As comes to all our flight and death, my folly now I fear"
14683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hath bred this scandal, all our town now burns my ominous ear"
14684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With whisp’ring: ‘Hector’s self-conceit hath cast away his host.’
14685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, this true, this extremity that I rely on most"
14686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is best for me: stay, and retire with this man’s life; or die"
14687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Here for our city with renown, since all else fled but I."
14688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And yet one way cuts both these ways: What if I hang my shield
14689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My helm and lance here on these walls, and meet in humble field"
14690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Renown’d Achilles, off’ring him Helen and all the wealth,"
14691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whatever in his hollow keels bore Alexander’s stealth
14692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For both th’ Atrides? For the rest, whatever is possess’d"
14693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all this city, known or hid, by oath shall be confess’d"
14694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all our citizens; of which one half the Greeks shall have,"
14695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One half themselves. But why, lov’d soul, would these suggestions save"
14696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy state still in me? I’ll not sue; nor would he grant, but I,"
14697,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mine arms cast off, should be assur’d a woman’s death to die."
14698,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To men of oak and rock, no words; virgins and youths talk thus,"
14699,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Virgins and youths that love and woo; there’s other war with us;
14700,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What blows and conflicts urge, we cry, hates and defiances,"
14701,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, with the garlands these trees bear, try which hand Jove will"
14702,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,bless.”
14703,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These thoughts employ’d his stay; and now Achilles comes, now near"
14704,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His Mars-like presence terribly came brandishing his spear,"
14705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His right arm shook it, his bright arms like day came glitt’ring on,"
14706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like fire-light, or the light of heav’n shot from the rising sun,"
14707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This sight outwrought discourse, cold fear shook Hector from his stand;"
14708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No more stay now; all ports were left; he fled in fear the hand
14709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of that Fear-Master; who, hawk-like, air’s swiftest passenger,"
14710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That holds a tim’rous dove in chase, and with command doth bear"
14711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His fi’ry onset, the dove hastes, the hawk comes whizzing on,"
14712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This way and that he turns and winds, and cuffs the pigeón,"
14713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, till he truss it, his great spirit lays hot charge on his wing;"
14714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So urg’d Achilles Hector’s flight; so still fear’s point did sting
14715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His troubled spirit, his knees wrought hard, along the wall he flew,"
14716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In that fair chariot-way that runs, beneath the tow’r of view,"
14717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Troy’s wild fig-tree, till they reach’d where those two"
14718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,mother-springs
14719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of deep Scamander pour’d abroad their silver murmurings;
14720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One warm and casts out fumes as fire; the other cold as snow,"
14721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or hail dissolv’d. And when the sun made ardent summer glow,"
14722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There water’s concrete crystal shin’d; near which were cisterns made,"
14723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All pav’d and clear, where Trojan wives and their fair daughters had"
14724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laundry for their fine linen weeds, in times of cleanly peace,"
14725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before the Grecians brought their siege. These captains noted these,"
14726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One flying, th’ other in pursuit; a strong man flew before,"
14727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A stronger follow’d him by far, and close up to him bore;"
14728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both did their best, for neither now ran for a sacrifice,"
14729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or for the sacrificer’s hide, our runners’ usual prize;"
14730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These ran for tame-horse Hector’s soul. And as two running steeds,"
14731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Back’d in some set race for a game, that tries their swiftest speeds,"
14732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(A tripod, or a woman, giv’n for some man’s funerals)"
14733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Such speed made these men, and on foot ran thrice about the walls.[1]"
14734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods beheld them, all much mov’d; and Jove said: “O ill sight!"
14735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man I love much, I see forc’d in most unworthy flight"
14736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About great Ilion. My heart grieves; he paid so many vows,"
14737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With thighs of sacrificéd beeves, both on the lofty brows"
14738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Ida, and in Ilion’s height. Consult we, shall we free"
14739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His life from death, or give it now t’ Achilles’ victory?”"
14740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Minerva answer’d: “Alter Fate? One long since mark’d for death?
14741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now take from death? Do thou; but know, he still shall run beneath"
14742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our other censures.” “Be it then,” replied the Thunderer,"
14743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“My lov’d Tritonia, at thy will; in this I will prefer"
14744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy free intention, work it all.” Then stoop’d She from the sky"
14745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To this great combat. Peleus’ son pursu’d incessantly
14746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still-flying Hector. As a hound that having rous’d a hart,"
14747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Although he tappish ne’er so oft, and ev’ry shrubby part"
14748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Attempts for strength, and trembles in, the hound doth still pursue"
14749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So close that not a foot he fails, but hunts it still at view;"
14750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So plied Achilles Hector’s steps; as oft as he assay’d
14751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Dardan ports and tow’rs for strength (to fetch from thence some aid
14752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With wingéd shafts) so oft forc’d he amends of pace, and stept"
14753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Twixt him and all his hopes, and still upon the field he kept"
14754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His utmost turnings to the town. And yet, as in a dream,"
14755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One thinks he gives another chase, when such a fain’d extreme"
14756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Possesseth both, that he in chase the chaser cannot fly,"
14757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor can the chaser get to hand his flying enemy;[2]
14758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So nor Achilles’ chase could reach the flight of Hector’s pace,"
14759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor Hector’s flight enlarge itself of swift Achilles’ chace.
14760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But how chanc’d this? How, all this time, could Hector bear the knees"
14761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of fierce Achilles with his own, and keep off destinies,"
14762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If Phœbus, for his last and best, through all that course had fail’d"
14763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To add his succours to his nerves, and, as his foe assail’d"
14764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Near and within him, fed his ’scape? Achilles yet well knew"
14765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His knees would fetch him, and gave signs to some friends (making shew"
14766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of shooting at him) to forbear, lest they detracted so"
14767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From his full glory in first wounds, and in the overthrow"
14768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Make his hand last. But when they reach’d the fourth time the two
14769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"founts,"
14770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Jove his golden scales weigh’d up, and took the last accounts"
14771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of fate for Hector, putting in for him and Peleus’ son"
14772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two fates of bitter death; of which high heav’n receiv’d the one,"
14773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The other hell; so low declin’d the light of Hector’s life.
14774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Phœbus left him, when war’s Queen came to resolve the strife"
14775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In th’ other’s knowledge: “Now,” said she, “Jove-lov’d Æacides,"
14776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I hope at last to make renown perform a brave access
14777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all the Grecians; we shall now lay low this champion’s height,"
14778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though never so insatiate was his great heart of fight.
14779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor must he ’scape our púrsuit still, though at the feet of Jove"
14780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apollo bows into a sphere, soliciting more love"
14781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his most favour’d. Breathe thee then, stand firm, myself will haste"
14782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And hearten Hector to change blows.” She went, and he stood fast,"
14783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lean’d on his lance, and much was joy’d that single strokes should try"
14784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This fadging conflict. Then came close the changéd Deity
14785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Hector, like Deiphobus in shape and voice, and said:"
14786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O brother, thou art too much urg’d to be thus combated"
14787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About our own walls; let us stand, and force to a retreat"
14788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Th’ insulting chaser.” Hector joy’d at this so kind deceit,"
14789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “O good Deiphobus, thy love was most before"
14790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Of all my brothers) dear to me, but now exceeding more"
14791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It costs me honour, that, thus urg’d, thou com’st to part the charge"
14792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my last fortunes; other friends keep town, and leave at large"
14793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My rack’d endeavours.” She replied: “Good brother, ’tis most true,"
14794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One after other, king and queen, and all our friends, did sue,"
14795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n on their knees, to stay me there, such tremblings shake them all"
14796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With this man’s terror; but my mind so griev’d to see our wall
14797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Girt with thy chases, that to death I long’d to urge thy stay."
14798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come, fight we, thirsty of his blood; no more let’s fear to lay"
14799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cost on our lances, but approve, if, bloodied with our spoils,"
14800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He can bear glory to their fleet, or shut up all their toils"
14801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his one suff’rance on thy lance.” With this deceit she led,"
14802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, both come near, thus Hector spake: “Thrice have I compasséd"
14803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This great town, Peleus’ son, in flight, with aversation"
14804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That out of fate put off my steps; but now all flight is flown,"
14805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The short course set up, death or life. Our resolutions yet"
14806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must shun all rudeness, and the Gods before our valour set"
14807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For use of victory; and they being worthiest witnesses
14808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all vows, since they keep vows best, before their Deities"
14809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Let vows of fit respect pass both, when conquest hath bestow’d"
14810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her wreath on either. Here I vow no fury shall be show’d,"
14811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That is not manly, on thy corse, but, having spoil’d thy arms,"
14812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Resign thy person; which swear thou.” These fair and temp’rate terms
14813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Far fled Achilles; his brows bent, and out flew this reply:"
14814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Hector, thou only pestilence in all mortality"
14815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To my sere spirits, never set the point ’twixt thee and me"
14816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Any conditions; but as far as men and lions fly
14817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All terms of cov’nant, lambs and wolves; in so far opposite state,"
14818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Impossible for love t’ atone, stand we, till our souls satiate"
14819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The God of soldiers. Do not dream that our disjunction can
14820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Endure condition. Therefore now, all worth that fits a man"
14821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call to thee, all particular parts that fit a soldier,"
14822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And they all this include (besides the skill and spirit of war)
14823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hunger for slaughter, and a hate that eats thy heart to eat"
14824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy foe’s heart. This stirs, this supplies in death the killing heat;"
14825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And all this need’st thou. No more flight. Pallas Athenia
14826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will quickly cast thee to my lance. Now, now together draw"
14827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All griefs for vengeance, both in me, and all my friends late dead"
14828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That bled thee, raging with thy lance.” This said, he brandishéd"
14829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His long lance, and away it sung; which Hector giving view,"
14830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stoop’d low, stood firm, foreseeing it best, and quite it overflew,"
14831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fast’ning on earth. Athenia drew it, and gave her friend,"
14832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unseen of Hector. Hector then thus spake: “Thou want’st thy end,"
14833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"God-like Achilles. Now I see, thou hast not learn’d my fate"
14834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Jove at all, as thy high words would bravely intimate."
14835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Much tongue affects thee. Cunning words well serve thee to prepare
14836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy blows with threats, that mine might faint with want of spirit to"

14838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But my back never turns with breath; it was not born to bear
14839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Burthens of wounds; strike home before; drive at my breast thy spear,"
14840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As mine at thine shall, and try then if heav’n’s will favour thee"
14841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With scape of my lance. O would Jove would take it after me,"
14842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And make thy bosom take it all! An easy end would crown
14843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our difficult wars, were thy soul fled, thou most bane of our town.”"
14844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus flew his dart, touch’d at the midst of his black shield, and flew"
14845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A huge way from it; but his heart wrath enter’d with the view
14846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of that hard scape, and heavy thoughts strook through him, when he"
14847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,spied
14848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His brother vanish’d, and no lance beside left; out he cried:"
14849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Deiphobus, another lance.” Lance nor Deiphobus"
14850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood near his call. And then his mind saw all things ominous,"
14851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thus suggested: “Woe is me, the Gods have call’d, and I"
14852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Must meet death here! Deiphobus I well hop’d had been by
14853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his white shield; but our strong walls shield him, and this deceit"
14854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flows from Minerva. Now, O now, ill death comes, no more flight,"
14855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No more recovery. O Jove, this hath been otherwise;"
14856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy bright son and thyself have set the Greeks a greater prize
14857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Hector’s blood than now; of which, ev’n jealous, you had care,"
14858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But Fate now conquers; I am hers; and yet not she shall share
14859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In my renown; that life is left to every noble spirit,"
14860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And that some great deed shall beget that all lives shall inherit.”
14861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus, forth his sword flew, sharp and broad, and bore a deadly weight,"
14862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With which he rush’d in. And look how an eagle from her height
14863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stoops to the rapture of a lamb, or cuffs a tim’rous hare;"
14864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So fell in Hector; and at him Achilles; his mind’s fare
14865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was fierce and mighty, his shield cast a sun-like radiance,"
14866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Helm nodded, and his four plumes shook, and, when he rais’d his lance,"
14867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up Hesp’rus rose ’mongst th’ evening stars. His bright and sparkling
14868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,eyes
14869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Look’d through the body of his foe, and sought through all that prise"
14870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The next way to his thirsted life. Of all ways, only one"
14871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Appear’d to him, and that was where th’ unequal winding bone,"
14872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That joins the shoulders and the neck, had place, and where there lay"
14873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The speeding way to death; and there his quick eye could display
14874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The place it sought, e’en through those arms his friend Patroclus wore"
14875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When Hector slew him. There he aim’d, and there his jav’lin tore"
14876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Stern passage quite through Hector’s neck; yet miss’d it so his throat
14877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It gave him pow’r to change some words; but down to earth it got
14878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His fainting body. Then triumph’d divine Æacides:
14879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Hector,” said he, “thy heart suppos’d that in my friend’s decease"
14880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy life was safe; my absent arm not car’d for. Fool! he left
14881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One at the fleet that better’d him, and he it is that reft"
14882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy strong knees thus; and now the dogs and fowls in foulest use
14883,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall tear thee up, thy corse expos’d to all the Greeks’ abuse.”"
14884,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, fainting, said: “Let me implore, ev’n by thy knees and soul,"
14885,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thy great parents, do not see a cruelty so foul"
14886,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Inflicted on me. Brass and gold receive at any rate,"
14887,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And quit my person, that the peers and ladies of our state"
14888,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May tomb it, and to sacred fire turn thy profane decrees.”"
14889,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Dog,” he replied, “urge not my ruth, by parents, soul, nor knees."
14890,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I would to God that any rage would let me eat thee raw,"
14891,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Slic’d into pieces, so beyond the right of any law"
14892,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I taste thy merits! And, believe, it flies the force of man"
14893,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To rescue thy head from the dogs. Give all the gold they can,"
14894,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,If ten or twenty times so much as friends would rate thy price
14895,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were tender’d here, with vows of more, to buy the cruelties"
14896,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I here have vow’d, and after that thy father with his gold"
14897,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would free thyself; all that should fail to let thy mother hold
14898,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Solemnities of death with thee, and do thee such a grace"
14899,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To mourn thy whole corse on a bed; which piecemeal I’ll deface
14900,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With fowls and dogs.” He, dying, said: “I, knowing thee well, foresaw"
14901,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy now tried tyranny, nor hop’d for any other law,"
14902,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of nature, or of nations; and that fear forc’d much more"
14903,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than death my flight, which never touch’d at Hector’s foot before."
14904,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A soul of iron informs thee. Mark, what vengeance th’ equal fates"
14905,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will give me of thee for this rage, when in the Scæan gates"
14906,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Phœbus and Paris meet with thee.” Thus death’s hand clos’d his eyes,"
14907,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His soul flying his fair limbs to hell, mourning his destinies,"
14908,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To part so with his youth and strength. Thus dead, thus Thetis’ son"
14909,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His prophecy answer’d: “Die thou now. When my short thread is spun,"
14910,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll bear it as the will of Jove.” This said, his brazen spear"
14911,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He drew, and stuck by; then his arms, that all embruéd were,"
14912,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He spoil’d his shoulders of. Then all the Greeks ran in to him,"
14913,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see his person, and admir’d his terror-stirring limb;"
14914,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Yet none stood by that gave no wound to his so goodly form;
14915,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When each to other said: “O Jove, he is not in the storm"
14916,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He came to fleet in with his fire, he handles now more soft.”"
14917,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O friends,” said stern Æacides, “now that the Gods have brought"
14918,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This man thus down, I’ll freely say, he brought more bane to Greece"
14919,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than all his aiders. Try we then, thus arm’d at ev’ry piece,"
14920,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And girding all Troy with our host, if now their hearts will leave"
14921,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their city clear, her clear stay slain, and all their lives receive,"
14922,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or hold yet, Hector being no more. But why use I a word"
14923,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of any act but what concerns my friend? Dead, undeplor’d,"
14924,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unsepulchred, he lies at fleet, unthought on! Never hour"
14925,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall make his dead state, while the quick enjoys me, and this pow’r"
14926,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To move these movers. Though in hell, men say, that such as die"
14927,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Oblivion seizeth, yet in hell in me shall Memory"
14928,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hold all her forms still of my friend. Now, youths of Greece, to fleet"
14929,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bear we this body, pæans sing, and all our navy greet"
14930,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With endless honour; we have slain Hector, the period"
14931,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all Troy’s glory, to whose worth all vow’d as to a God.”"
14932,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, a work not worthy him he set to; of both feet"
14933,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He bor’d the nerves through from the heel to th’ ankle, and then knit"
14934,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both to his chariot with a thong of whitleather, his head[3]"
14935,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Trailing the centre. Up he got to chariot, where he laid"
14936,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The arms repurchas’d, and scourg’d on his horse that freely flew."
14937,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A whirlwind made of startled dust drave with them as they drew,"
14938,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With which were all his black-brown curls knotted in heaps and fil’d.
14939,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And there lay Troy’s late Gracious, by Jupiter exil’d"
14940,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all disgrace in his own land, and by his parents seen;"
14941,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When, like her son’s head, all with dust Troy’s miserable queen"
14942,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Distain’d her temples, plucking off her honour’d hair, and tore"
14943,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her royal garments, shrieking out. In like kind Priam bore"
14944,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sacred person, like a wretch that never saw good day,"
14945,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Broken with outcries. About both the people prostrate lay,"
14946,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Held down with clamour; all the town veil’d with a cloud of tears.
14947,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ilion, with all his tops on fire, and all the massacres,"
14948,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left for the Greeks, could put on looks of no more overthrow"
14949,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Than now fraid life. And yet the king did all their looks outshow.
14950,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wretched people could not bear his sov’reign wretchedness,"
14951,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Plaguing himself so, thrusting out, and praying all the press"
14952,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To open him the Dardan ports, that he alone might fetch"
14953,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His dearest son in, and (all fil’d with tumbling) did beseech"
14954,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Each man by name, thus: “Lov’d friends, be you content, let me,"
14955,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though much ye grieve, be that poor mean to our sad remedy"
14956,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now in our wishes; I will go and pray this impious man,"
14957,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Author of horrors, making proof if age’s rev’rence can"
14958,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Excite his pity. His own sire is old like me; and he
14959,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That got him to our griefs, perhaps, may, for my likeness, be"
14960,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mean for our ruth to him. Alas, you have no cause of cares,"
14961,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Compar’d with me! I many sons, grac’d with their freshest years,"
14962,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have lost by him, and all their deaths in slaughter of this one"
14963,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Afflicted man) are doubled. This will bitterly set gone
14964,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My soul to hell. O would to heaven I could but hold him dead
14965,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In these pin’d arms, then tears on tears might fall, till all were shed"
14966,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In common fortune! Now amaze their natural course doth stop,"
14967,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And pricks a mad vein.” Thus he mourn’d, and with him all break ope"
14968,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their store of sorrows. The poor Queen amongst the women wept
14969,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Turn’d into anguish: “O my son,” she cried out, “why still kept"
14970,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patient of horrors is my life, when thine is vanishéd?"
14971,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My days thou glorifi’dst, my nights rung of some honour’d deed"
14972,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Done by thy virtues, joy to me, profit to all our care."
14973,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All made a God of thee, and thou mad’st them all that they are,"
14974,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now under fate, now dead.” These two thus vented as they could"
14975,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,There sorrow’s furnace; Hector’s wife not having yet been told
14976,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,So much as of his stay without. She in her chamber close
14977,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sat at her loom; a piece of work, grac’d with a both sides’ gloss,"
14978,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strew’d curiously with varied flowers, her pleasure was; her care,"
14979,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To heat a caldron for her lord, to bathe him turn’d from war,"
14980,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of which she chief charge gave her maids. Poor dame, she little knew"
14981,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,How much her cares lack’d of his case! But now the clamour flew
14982,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to her turret; then she shook, her work fell from her hand,"
14983,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And up she started, call’d her maids, she needs must understand"
14984,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That ominous outcry: “Come,” said she, I hear through all this cry"
14985,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My mother’s voice shriek; to my throat my heart bounds; ecstasy
14986,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Utterly alters me; some fate is near the hapless sons
14987,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of fading Priam. Would to God my words’ suspicións
14988,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No ear had heard yet! O I fear, and that most heartily,"
14989,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That, with some stratagem, the son of Peleus hath put by"
14990,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The wall of Ilion my lord, and, trusty of his feet,"
14991,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Obtain’d the chase of him alone, and now the curious heat"
14992,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his still desp’rate spirit is cool’d. It let him never keep
14993,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In guard of others; before all his violent foot must step,"
14994,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or his place forfeited he held.” Thus fury-like she went,"
14995,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two women, as she will’d, at hand; and made her quick ascent"
14996,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up to the tow’r and press of men, her spirit in uproar. Round"
14997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She cast her greedy eye, and saw her Hector slain, and bound"
14998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"T’ Achilles’ chariot, manlessly dragg’d to the Grecian fleet."
14999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Black night strook through her, under her trance took away her feet,"
15000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And back she shrunk with such a sway that off her head-tire flew,"
15001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her coronet, caul, ribands, veil that golden Venus threw"
15002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On her white shoulders that high day when warlike Hector won
15003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her hand in nuptials in the court of king Eetion,"
15004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that great dow’r then giv’n with her. About her, on their knees,"
15005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her husband’s sisters, brothers’ wives, fell round, and by degrees"
15006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Recover’d her. Then, when again her respirations found"
15007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Free pass (her mind and spirit met) these thoughts her words did sound:
15008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Hector, O me, curséd dame, both born beneath one fate,"
15009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou here, I in Cilician Thebes, where Placus doth elate"
15010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His shady forehead, in the court where king Eetion,"
15011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hapless, begot unhappy me; which would he had not done,"
15012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To live past thee! Thou now art div’d to Pluto’s gloomy throne,"
15013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sunk through the coverts of the earth; I, in a hell of moan,"
15014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left here thy widow; one poor babe born to unhappy both,"
15015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom thou leav’st helpless as he thee, he born to all the wroth"
15016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of woe and labour. Lands left him will others seize upon;
15017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The orphan day of all friends’ helps robs ev’ry mother’s son.
15018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,An orphan all men suffer sad; his eyes stand still with tears;
15019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Need tries his father’s friends, and fails; of all his favourers,"
15020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If one the cup gives, ’tis not long, the wine he finds in it"
15021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Scarce moists his palate; if he chance to gain the grace to sit,"
15022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Surviving fathers’ sons repine, use contumelies, strike,"
15023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bid, ‘leave us, where’s thy father’s place?’ He, weeping with dislike,"
15024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Retires to me, to me, alas! Astyanax is he"
15025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Born to these mis’ries; he that late fed on his father’s knee,"
15026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To whom all knees bow’d, daintiest fare appos’d him; and when sleep"
15027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lay on his temples, his cries still’d, his heart ev’n laid in steep"
15028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all things precious, a soft bed, a careful nurse’s arms,"
15029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Took him to guardiance. But now as huge a world of harms
15030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lies on his suff’rance; now thou want’st thy father’s hand to friend,"
15031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O my Astyanax; O my lord, thy hand that did defend"
15032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These gates of Ilion, these long walls by thy arm measur’d still"
15033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amply and only. Yet at fleet thy naked corse must fill
15034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Vile worms, when dogs are satiate, far from thy parents’ care,"
15035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Far from those fun’ral ornaments that thy mind would prepare
15036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(So sudden being the chance of arms) ever expecting death.
15037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which task, though my heart would not serve t’ employ my hands beneath,"
15038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I made my women yet perform. Many, and much in price,"
15039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Were those integuments they wrought t’ adorn thy exsequies;
15040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which, since they fly thy use, thy corse not laid in their attire,"
15041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy sacrifice they shall be made; these hands in mischievous fire
15042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall vent their vanities. And yet, being consecrate to thee,"
15043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They shall be kept for citizens, and their fair wives, to see.”"
15044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus spake she weeping; all the dames endeavouring to cheer
15045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her desert state, fearing their own, wept with her tear for tear."

15131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"May ply their business.” This all ears did freely entertain,"
15132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And found observance. Then they supp’d with all things fit, and all"
15133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Repair’d to tents and rest. The friend the shores maritimal
15134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sought for his bed, and found a place, fair, and upon which play’d"
15135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The murmuring billows. There his limbs to rest, not sleep, he laid,"
15136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Heavily sighing. Round about, silent and not too near,"
15137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stood all his Myrmidons; when straight, so over-labour’d were"
15138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His goodly lineaments with chase of Hector, that, beyond"
15139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His resolution not to sleep, Sleep cast his sudden bond"
15140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Over his sense, and loos’d his care. Then of his wretched friend"
15141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Soul appear’d; at ev’ry part the form did comprehend
15142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His likeness; his fair eyes, his voice, his stature, ev’ry weed"
15143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His person wore, it fantasied; and stood above his head,"
15144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This sad speech utt’ring: “Dost thou sleep? Æacides, am I"
15145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forgotten of thee? Being alive, I found thy memory"
15146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ever respectful; but now, dead, thy dying love abates."
15147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Inter me quickly, enter me in Pluto’s iron gates,"
15148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For now the souls (the shades) of men, fled from this being, beat"
15149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My spirit from rest, and stay my much-desir’d receipt"
15150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst souls plac’d beyond the flood. Now ev’ry way I err
15151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About this broad-door’d house of Dis. O help then to prefer
15152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My soul yet further! Here I mourn, but, had the fun’ral fire"
15153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Consum’d my body, never more my spirit should retire"
15154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From hell’s low región; from thence souls never are retriev’d
15155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To talk with friends here; nor shall I; a hateful fate depriv’d
15156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My being here, that at my birth was fix’d; and to such fate"
15157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n thou, O god-like man, art mark’d; the deadly Ilion gate"
15158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Must entertain thy death. O then, I charge thee now, take care"
15159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That our bones part not; but as life combin’d in equal fare
15160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our loving beings, so let death. When from Opunta’s tow’rs"
15161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My father brought me to your roofs (since, ’gainst my will, my pow’rs"
15162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Incens’d, and indiscreet at dice, slew fair Amphidamas)"
15163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then Peleus entertain’d me well; then in thy charge I was
15164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By his injunction and thy love; and therein let me still
15165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Receive protection. Both our bones, provide in thy last will,"
15166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That one urn may contain; and make that vessel all of gold,"
15167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Thetis gave thee, that rich urn.” This said, Sleep ceas’d to hold"
15168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles’ temples, and the Shade thus he receiv’d: “O friend,"
15169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What needed these commands? My care, before, meant to commend"
15170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My bones to thine, and in that urn. Be sure thy will is done."
15171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A little stay yet, let’s delight, with some full passión"
15172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of woe enough, either’s affects; embrace we.” Op’ning thus"
15173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His greedy arms, he felt no friend; like matter vaporous"
15174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Spirit vanish’d under earth, and murmur’d in his stoop."
15175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles started, both his hands he clapp’d, and lifted up,"
15176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this sort wond’ring: “O ye Gods, I see we have a soul"
15177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In th’ under-dwellings, and a kind of man-resembling idol;"
15178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The soul’s seat yet, all matter felt, stays with the carcass here."
15179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O friends, hapless Patroclus’ soul did all this night appear"
15180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Weeping and making moan to me, commanding ev’rything"
15181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That I intended towards him; so truly figuring
15182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself at all parts, as was strange.” This accident did turn"
15183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To much more sorrow, and begat a greediness to mourn"
15184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all that heard. When mourning thus, the rosy Morn arose,"
15185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And Agamemnon through the tents wak’d all, and did dispose"
15186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Both men and mules for carriage of matter for the fire;
15187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all which work Meriones, the Cretan sov’reign’s squire,"
15188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was captain; and abroad they went. Wood-cutting tools they bore
15189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all hands, and well-twisted cords. The mules march’d all before."
15190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Uphill, and down hill, overthwarts, and break-neck cliffs they pass’d;"
15191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, when the fountful Ida’s tops they scal’d with utmost haste,"
15192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All fell upon the high-hair’d oaks, and down their curléd brows,"
15193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fell bustling to the earth, and up went all the boles and boughs"
15194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bound to the mules; and back again they parted the harsh way
15195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amongst them through the tangling shrubs, and long they thought the day"
15196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till in the plain field all arriv’d, for all the woodmen bore"
15197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Logs on their necks; Meriones would have it so. The shore
15198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At last they reach’d yet, and then down their carriages they cast,"
15199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And sat upon them, where the son of Peleüs had plac’d"
15200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ground for his great sepulchre, and for his friend’s, in one."
15201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They rais’d a huge pile, and to arms went ev’ry Myrmidon,"
15202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Charg’d by Achilles; chariots and horse were harnesséd.
15203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fighters and charioteers got up, and they the sad march led,"
15204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A cloud of infinite foot behind. In midst of all was borne
15205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus’ person by his peers. On him were all heads shorn,"
15206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n till they cover’d him with curls. Next to him march’d his friend
15207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Embracing his cold neck all sad, since now he was to send"
15208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His dearest to his endless home. Arriv’d all where the wood
15209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was heap’d for fun’ral, they set down. Apart Achilles stood,"
15210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And when enough wood was heap’d on, he cut his golden hair,"
15211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Long kept for Sperchius the flood, in hope of safe repair"
15212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Phthia by that river’s pow’r; but now left hopeless thus,"
15213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Enrag’d, and looking on the sea, he cried out: “Sperchius,"
15214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In vain my father’s piety vow’d, at my implor’d return"
15215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To my lov’d country, that these curls should on thy shores be shorn,"
15216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides a sacred hecatomb, and sacrifice beside"
15217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of fifty wethers, at those founts, where men have edified"
15218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A lofty temple, and perfum’d an altar to thy name."
15219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There vow’d he all these offerings; but fate prevents thy fame,"
15220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His hopes not suff’ring satisfied. And since I never more
15221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall see my lov’d soil, my friend’s hands shall to the Stygian shore"
15222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Convey these tresses.” Thus he put in his friend’s hands the hair;
15223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And this bred fresh desire of moan; and in that sad affair
15224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sun had set amongst them all, had Thetis’ son not spoke"
15225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus to Atrides: “King of men, thy aid I still invoke,"
15226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since thy command all men still hear. Dismiss thy soldiers now,"
15227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And let them victual; they have mourn’d sufficient; ’tis we owe
15228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The dead this honour; and with us let all the captains stay.”
15229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This heard, Atrides instantly the soldiers sent away;"
15230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fun’ral officers remain’d, and heap’d on matter still,"
15231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till of an hundred foot about they made the fun’ral pile,"
15232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In whose hot height they cast the corse, and then they pour’d on tears."
15233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Numbers of fat sheep, and like store of crooked-going steers,"
15234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They slew before the solemn fire; stripp’d off their hides and dress’d.
15235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of which Achilles took the fat, and cover’d the deceas’d"
15236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From head to foot; and round about he made the officers pile
15237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The beasts’ nak’d bodies, vessels full of honey and of oil"
15238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pour’d in them, laid upon a bier, and cast into the fire."
15239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Four goodly horse; and of nine hounds, two most in the desire"
15240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of that great prince, and trencher-fed; all fed that hungry flame."
15241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve Trojan princes last stood forth, young, and of toward fame,"
15242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All which (set on with wicked spirits) there strook he, there he slew,"
15243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And to the iron strength of fire their noble limbs he threw.
15244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then breath’d his last sighs, and these words: “Again rejoice, my"
15245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"friend,"
15246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n in the joyless depth of hell. Now give I cómplete end
15247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To all my vows. Alone thy life sustain’d not violence,"
15248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve Trojan princes wait on thee, and labour to incense"
15249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy glorious heap of funeral. Great Hector I’ll excuse,"
15250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The dogs shall eat him.” These high threats perform’d not their abuse;
15251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove’s daughter, Venus, took the guard of noble Hector’s corse,"
15252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And kept the dogs off, night and day applying sov’reign force"
15253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of rosy balms, that to the dogs were horrible in taste,"
15254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with which she the body fill’d. Renown’d Apollo cast
15255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A cloud from heav’n, lest with the sun the nerves and lineaments"
15256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Might dry and putrefy. And now some Pow’rs denied consents
15257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To this solemnity; the Fire (for all the oily fuel
15258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It had injected) would not burn; and then the loving Cruel
15259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Studied for help, and, standing off, invok’d the two fair Winds,"
15260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Zephyr and Boreas, to afford the rage of both their kinds"
15261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To aid his outrage. Precious gifts his earnest zeal did vow
15262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pour’d from a golden bowl much wine, and pray’d them both to blow,"
15263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That quickly his friend’s corse might burn, and that heap’s sturdy"
15264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,breast
15265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Embrace consumption. Iris heard. The Winds were at a feast,"
15266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All in the court of Zephyrus, that boist’rous blowing Air,"
15267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Gather’d together. She that wears the thousand-colour’d hair
15268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Flew thither, standing in the porch. They, seeing her, all arose,"
15269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call’d to her, ev’ry one desir’d she would awhile repose,"
15270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And eat with them. She answer’d: “No, no place of seat is here;"
15271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Retreat calls to the Ocean and Æthiopia, where"
15272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A hecatomb is off’ring now to heav’n, and there must I"
15273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Partake the feast of sacrifice. I come to signify
15274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That Thetis’ son implores your aids, princes of North and West,"
15275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With vows of much fair sacrifice, if each will set his breast"
15276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against his heap of funeral, and make it quickly burn;"
15277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Patroclus lies there, whose decease all the Achaians mourn.”"
15278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She said, and parted; and out rush’d, with an unmeasur’d roar,"
15279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those two Winds, tumbling clouds in heaps, ushers to either’s blore,"
15280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And instantly they reach’d the sea; up flew the waves; the gale
15281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was strong; reach’d fruitful Troy; and full upon the fire they fall.
15282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The huge heap thunder’d. All night long from his chok’d breast they
15283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,blew
15284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A lib’ral flame up; and all night swift-foot Achilles threw
15285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wine from a golden bowl on earth, and steep’d the soil in wine,"
15286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Still calling on Patroclus’ soul. No father could incline
15287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More to a son most dear, nor more mourn at his burnéd bones,"
15288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Than did the great prince to his friend at his combustións,"
15289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still creeping near and near the heap, still sighing, weeping still."
15290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when the Day-star look’d abroad, and promis’d from hi hill"
15291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Light, which the saffron Morn made good, and sprinkled on the seas,"
15292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then languish’d the great pile, then sunk the flames, and then calm"
15293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Peace
15294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Turn’d back the rough Winds to their homes; the Thracian billow rings.
15295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their high retreat, ruffled with cuffs of their triumphant wings."
15296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pelides then forsook the pile, and to his tired limb"
15297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Choos’d place of rest; where laid, sweet sleep fell to his wish on him."
15298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When all the king’s guard (waiting then, perceiving will to rise"
15299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In that great session) hurried in, and op’d again his eyes"
15300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With tumult of their troop, and haste. A little then he rear’d"
15301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His troubled person, sitting up, and this affair referr’d"
15302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To wish’d commandment of the kings: “Atrides, and the rest"
15303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of our commanders general, vouchsafe me this request"
15304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before your parting: Give in charge the quenching with black wine
15305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of this heap’s relics, ev’ry brand the yellow fire made shine;"
15306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then let search Patroclus’ bones, distinguishing them well;"
15307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As well ye may, they kept the midst, the rest at random fell"
15308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About th’ extreme part of the pile; men’s bones and horses’ mixed.
15309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being found, I’ll find an urn of gold t’ enclose them, and betwixt"
15310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The air and them two kels of fat lay on them, and to rest"
15311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Commit them, till mine own bones seal our love, my soul deceas’d."
15312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sepulchre I have not charg’d to make of too much state,"
15313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But of a model something mean, that you of younger fate,"
15314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When I am gone, may amplify with such a breadth and height"
15315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As fits your judgments and our worths.” This charge receiv’d his weight
15316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all observance. First they quench’d with sable wine the heap,"
15317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As far as it had fed the flame. The ash fell wondrous deep,"
15318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In which his consorts, that his life religiously lov’d,"
15319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Search’d, weeping, for his bones; which found, they conscionably prov’d"
15320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His will made to Æacides, and what his love did add."
15321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A golden vessel, double fat, contain’d them. All which, clad"
15322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In veils of linen, pure and rich, were solemnly convey’d"
15323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,T’ Achilles’ tent. The platform then about the pile they laid
15324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his fit sepulchre, and rais’d a heap of earth, and then"
15325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Offer’d departure. But the prince retain’d there still his men,"
15326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Employing them to fetch from fleet rich tripods for his games,"
15327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Caldrons, horse, mules, broad-headed beeves, bright steel, and brighter"
15328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"dames,"
15329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The best at horse-race he ordain’d a lady for his prize,"
15330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gen’rally praiseful, fair and young, and skill’d in housewif’ries"
15331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all kinds fitting; and withal a trivet, that inclos’d"
15332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twenty-two measures’ room, with ears. The next prize he propos’d"
15333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was (that which then had high respect) a mare of six years old,"
15334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Unhandled, horséd with a mule, and ready to have foal’d."
15335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The third game was a caldron, new, fair, bright, and could for size"
15336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Contain two measures. For the fourth, two talents’ quantities"
15337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of finest gold. The fifth game was a great new standing bowl,"
15338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To set down both ways. These brought in, Achilles then stood up,"
15339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “Atrides and my lords, chief horsemen of our host,"
15340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These games expect ye. If myself should interpose my most
15341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For our horse-race, I make no doubt that I should take again"
15342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These gifts propos’d. Ye all know well, of how divine a strain"
15343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My horse are, and how eminent. Of Neptune’s gift they are"
15344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Peleus, and of his to me. Myself then will not share"
15345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In gifts giv’n others, nor my steeds breathe any spirit to shake"
15346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their airy pasterns; so they mourn for their kind guider’s sake,"
15347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Late lost; that us’d with humorous oil to slick their lofty manes,"
15348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Clear water having cleans’d them first; and, his bane being their"
15349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"banes,"
15350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those lofty manes now strew the earth, their heads held shaken down."
15351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You then that trust in chariots, and hope with horse to crown"
15352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your conqu’ring temples, gird yourselves; now, fame and prize stretch"
15353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"for,"
15354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All that have spirits.” This fir’d all. The first competitor
15355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was king Eumelus, whom the art of horsemanship did grace,"
15356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Son to Admetus. Next to him rose Diomed to the race,"
15357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That under reins rul’d Trojan horse, of late forc’d from the son"
15358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of lord Anchises, himself freed of near confusion"
15359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,By Phœbus. Next to him set forth the yellow-headed king
15360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Lacedæmon, Jove’s high seed; and, in his managing,"
15361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Podargus and swift Æthe trod, steeds to the King of men;"
15362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Æthe giv’n by Echepolus, the Anchisiaden,"
15363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As bribe to free him from the war resolv’d for Ilion;
15364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So Delicacy feasted him, whom Jove bestow’d upon"
15365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A mighty wealth; his dwelling was in broad Sicyone.
15366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Old Nestor’s son, Antilochus, was fourth for chivalry"
15367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In this contention; his fair horse were of the Pylian breed,"
15368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And his old father, coming near, inform’d him, for good speed,"
15369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With good race notes, in which himself could good instruction give:"
15370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Antilochus, though young thou art, yet thy grave virtues live"
15371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Belov’d of Neptune and of Jove. Their spirits have taught thee all
15372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The art of horsemanship, for which the less thy merits fall"
15373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In need of doctrine. Well thy skill can wield a chariot
15374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all fit turnings, yet thy horse their slow feet handle not"
15375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As fits thy manage, which makes me cast doubts of thy success."
15376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I well know all these are not seen in art of this address
15377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,More than thyself; their horses yet superior are to thine
15378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For their parts, thine want speed to make discharge of a design"
15379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To please an artist. But go on, show but thy art and heart"
15380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At all points, and set them against their horses’ heart and art;"
15381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Good judges will not see thee lose. A carpenter’s desert
15382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Stands more in cunning than in pow’r. A pilot doth avert
15383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His vessel from the rock, and wrack, tost with the churlish winds,"
15384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By skill, not strength. So sorts it here; one charioteer that finds"
15385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Want of another’s pow’r in horse must in his own skill set
15386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,An overplus of that to that; and so the proof will get
15387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Skill, that still rests within a man, more grace; than pow’r without."
15388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He that in horse and chariots trusts, is often hurl’d about"
15389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This way and that, unhandsomely, all-heaven wide of his end."
15390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, better skill’d, that rules worse horse, will all observance bend"
15391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Right on the scope still of a race, bear near, know ever when to rein,"
15392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When give rein, as his foe before, well noted in his vein"
15393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of manage and his steeds’ estate, presents occasion."
15394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll give thee instance now, as plain as if thou saw’st it done:"
15395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Here stands a dry stub of some tree, a cubit from the ground;[1]"
15396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Suppose the stub of oak or larch, for either are so sound"
15397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That neither rots with wet) two stones, white (mark you), white for"
15398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"view,"
15399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Parted on either side the stub; and these lay where they drew
15400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The way into a strait; the race betwixt both lying clear.
15401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Imagine them some monument of one long since tomb’d there,"
15402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or that they had been lists of race for men of former years,"
15403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As now the lists Achilles sets may serve for charioteers
15404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Many years hence. When near to these the race grows, then as right"
15405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Drive on them as thy eye can judge; then lay thy bridle’s weight
15406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Most of thy left side; thy right horse then switching, all thy throat,"
15407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Spent in encouragements, give him, and all the rein let float"
15408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,About his shoulders; thy near horse will yet be he that gave
15409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy skill the prize, and him rein so his head may touch the nave"
15410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of thy left wheel; but then take care thou runn’st not on the stone
15411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(With wrack of horse and chariot) which so thou bear’st upon.
15412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shipwrack within the hav’n avoid, by all means; that will breed"
15413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Others delight, and thee a shame. Be wise then, and take heed,"
15414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My lov’d son, get but to be first at turning in the course,"
15415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He lives not that can cote thee then, not if he back’d the horse"
15416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods bred, and Adrastus ow’d; divine Arion’s speed"
15417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Could not outpace thee, or the horse Laomedon did breed,"
15418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose race is famous, and fed here.” Thus sat Neleides,"
15419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When all that could be said was said. And then Meriones;[2]
15420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Set fifthly forth his fair-man’d horse. All leap’d to chariot;
15421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And ev’ry man then for the start cast in his proper lot.
15422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Achilles drew; Antilochus the lot set foremost forth;
15423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Eumelus next; Atrides third; Meriones the fourth;
15424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The fifth and last was Diomed, far first in excellence."
15425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All stood in order, and the lists Achilles fix’d far thence"
15426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In plain field; and a seat ordain’d fast by, in which he set"
15427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Renownéd Phœnix, that in grace of Peleus was so great,"
15428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see the race, and give a truth of all their passages."
15429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All start together, scourg’d, and cried, and gave their business"
15430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Study and order. Through the field they held a wingéd pace.
15431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beneath the bosom of their steeds a dust so dimm’d the race,"
15432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It stood above their heads in clouds, or like to storms amaz’d."
15433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Manes flew like ensigns with the wind. The chariots sometime graz’d,"
15434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And sometimes jump’d up to the air; yet still sat fast the men,"
15435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Their spirits ev’n panting in their breasts with fervour to obtain.
15436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when they turn’d to fleet again, then all men’s skills were tried,"
15437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Then stretch’d the pasterns of their steeds. Eumelus’ horse in pride
15438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still bore their sov’reign. After them came Diomed’s coursers close,"
15439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still apt to leap their chariot, and ready to repose"
15440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Upon the shoulders of their king their heads; his back ev’n burned
15441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With fire that from their nostrils flew; and then their lord had turn’d
15442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The race for him, or giv’n it doubt, if Phœbus had not smit"
15443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The scourge out of his hands, and tears of helpless wrath with it"
15444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From forth his eyes, to see his horse for want of scourge made slow,"
15445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And th’ others, by Apollo’s help, with much more swiftness go."
15446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Apollo’s spite Pallas discern’d, and flew to Tydeus’ son,"
15447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His scourge reach’d, and his horse made fresh. Then took her angry run"
15448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At king Eumelus, brake his gears; his mares on both sides flew,"
15449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His draught-tree fell to earth, and him the toss’d-up chariot threw"
15450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Down to the earth, his elbows torn, his forehead, all his face"
15451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strook at the centre, his speech lost. And then the turnéd race"
15452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fell to Tydides; before all his conqu’ring horse he drave,"
15453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And first he glitter’d in the race; divine Athenia gave
15454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Strength to his horse, and fame to him. Next him drave Sparta’s king."
15455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Antilochus his father’s horse then urg’d with all his sting
15456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of scourge and voice: “Run low,” said he, “stretch out your limbs, and"
15457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,fly;
15458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With Diomed’s horse I bid not strive, nor with himself strive I;"
15459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Athenia wings his horse, and him renowns; Atrides’ steeds"
15460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Are they ye must not fail but reach; and soon, lest soon succeeds"
15461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The blot of all your fames, to yield in swiftness to a mare,"
15462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To female Æthe. What’s the cause, ye best that ever were,"
15463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That thus ye fail us? Be assur’d, that Nestor’s love ye lose"
15464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For ever, if ye fail his son. Through both your both sides goes"
15465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His hot steel, if ye suffer me to bring the last prize home."
15466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Haste, overtake them instantly; we needs must overcome."
15467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This harsh way next us, this my mind will take, this I despise"
15468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For peril, this I’ll creep through. Hard the way to honour lies,"
15469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that take I, and that shall yield.” His horse by all this knew"
15470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He was not pleas’d, and fear’d his voice, and for a while they flew."
15471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But straight more clear appear’d the strait Antilochus foresaw,"
15472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It was a gasp the earth gave, forc’d by humours cold and raw,"
15473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pour’d out of Winter’s wat’ry breast, met there, and cleaving deep"
15474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All that near passage to the lists. This Nestor’s son would keep,"
15475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And left the roadway, being about. Atrides fear’d, and cried:[3]"
15476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Antilochus, thy course is mad; contain thy horse, we ride"
15477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A way most dangerous; turn head, betime take larger field,"
15478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,We shall be splitted.” Nestor’s son with much more scourge impell’d
15479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His horse for this, as if not heard; and got as far before"
15480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As any youth can cast a quoit. Atrides would no more;
15481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He back again, for fear himself, his goodly chariot,"
15482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And horse together, strew’d the dust, in being so dusty hot"
15483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of thirsted conquest. But he chid, at parting, passing sore:"
15484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Antilochus,” said he, “a worse than thee earth never bore."
15485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Farewell, we never thought thee wise that were wise; but not so"
15486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without oaths shall the wreath, be sure, crown thy mad temples. Go.”"
15487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet he bethought him, and went too, thus stirring up his steeds:"
15488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Leave me not last thus, nor stand vex’d. Let these fail in the speeds"
15489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of feet and knees, not you. Shall these, these old jades, past the"
15490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,flow’r
15491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of youth that you have, pass you?” This the horse fear’d, and more"
15492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,pow’r
15493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put to their knees, straight getting ground. Both flew, and so the"
15494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,rest.
15495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All came in smokes, like spirits. The Greeks, set, to see who did best,"
15496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without the race, aloft, now made a new discovery,"
15497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Other than that they made at first. Idomenëus’ eye
15498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Distinguish’d all, he knew the voice of Diomed, seeing a horse"
15499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of special mark, of colour bay, and was the first in course,"
15500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His forehead putting forth a star, round like the moon, and white."
15501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up stood the Cretan, utt’ring this: “Is it alone my sight,"
15502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Princes and captains, that discerns another lead the race"
15503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With other horse than led of late? Eumelus made most pace
15504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With his fleet mares, and he began the flexure as we thought;"
15505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now all the field I search, and find nowhere his view; hath nought"
15506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Befall’n amiss to him? Perhaps he hath not with success
15507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Perform’d his flexure; his reins lost, or seat, or with the tress"
15508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His chariot fail’d him, and his mares have outray’d with affright."
15509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stand up, try you your eyes, for mine hold with the second sight;"
15510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This seems to me th’ Ætolian king, the Tydean Diomed.”"
15511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“To you it seems so,” rusticly Ajax Oïleus said,"
15512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Your words are suited to your eyes. Those mares lead still that led,"
15513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eumelus owes them, and he still holds reins and place that did,"
15514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not fall’n as you hop’d. You must prate before us all, though last"
15515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In judgment of all. Y’ are too old, your tongue goes still too fast,"
15516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You must not talk so. Here are those that better thee, and look"
15517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For first place in the censure.” This Idomenëus took
15518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In much disdain, and thus replied: “Thou best in speeches worst,"
15519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Barbarous-languag’d, others here might have reprov’d me first,"
15520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not thou, unfitt’st of all. I bold a tripod with thee here,"
15521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or caldron, and our Gen’ral make our equal arbiter,"
15522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those horse are first, that when thou pay’st thou then may’st know.”"
15523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,This fir’d
15524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Oïliades more, and more than words this quarrel had inspir’d,"
15525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had not Achilles rose, and us’d this pacifying speech:"
15526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“No more. Away with words in war. It toucheth both with breach
15527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of that which fits ye. Your deserts should others reprehend
15528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That give such foul terms. Sit ye still, the men themselves will end"
15529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The strife betwixt you instantly, and either’s own load bear"
15530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his own shoulders. Then to both the first horse will appear,"
15531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And which is second.” These words us’d, Tydides was at hand,"
15532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His horse ran high, glanc’d on the way, and up they toss’d the sand"
15533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thick on their coachman; on their pace their chariot deck’d with gold
15534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Swiftly attended, no wheel seen, nor wheel’s print in the mould."
15535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Impress’d behind them. These horse flew a flight, not ran a race."
15536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Arriv’d, amids the lists they stood, sweat trickling down apace"
15537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their high manes and their prominent breasts; and down jumped Diomed,"
15538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Laid up his scourge aloft the seat, and straight his prize was led"
15539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Home to his tent. Rough Sthenelus laid quick hand on the dame,"
15540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And handled trivet, and sent both home by his men. Next came"
15541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Antilochus, that won with wiles, not swiftness of his horse,"
15542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Precedence of the gold-lock’d king, who yet maintained the course"
15543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So close, that not the king’s own horse gat more before the wheel"
15544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his rich chariot, that might still the insecution feel"
15545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With the extreme hairs of his tail (and that sufficient close
15546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Held to his leader, no great space it let him interpose"
15547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Consider’d in so great a field) that Nestor’s wily son
15548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gat of the king, now at his heels, though at the breach he won"
15549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A quoit’s cast of him, which the king again at th’ instant gain’d."
15550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Æthe Agamemnonides, that was so richly man’d,"
15551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Gat strength still as she spent; which words her worth had prov’d with
15552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"deeds,"
15553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had more ground been allow’d the race; and coted far his steeds,"
15554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,No question leaving for the prize. And now Meriones
15555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A dart’s cast came behind the king, his horse of speed much less,"
15556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself less skill’d t’ importune them, and give a chariot wing."
15557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Admetus’ son was last, whose plight Achilles pitying"
15558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thus spake: “Best man comes last; yet right must see his prize not
15559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"least,"
15560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The second his deserts must bear, and Diomed the best.”"
15561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He said, and all allow’d; and sure the mare had been his own,"
15562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had not Antilochus stood forth, and in his answer shown"
15563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Good reason for his interest: “Achilles,” he replied,"
15564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“I should be angry with you much to see this ratified.
15565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ought you to take from me my right, because his horse had wrong,"
15566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Himself being good? He should have us’d, as good men do, his tongue"
15567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In pray’r to Their pow’rs that bless good, not trusting to his own,"
15568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Not to have been in this good last. His chariot overthrown
15569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,O’erthrew not me. Who’s last? Who’s first? Men’s goodness without these
15570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is not our question. If his good you pity yet, and please"
15571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Princely to grace it, your tents hold a goodly deal of gold,"
15572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brass, horse, sheep, women; out of these your bounty may be bold,"
15573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To take a much more worthy prize than my poor merit seeks,"
15574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And give it here before my face, and all these, that the Greeks"
15575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,May glorify your lib’ral hands. This prize I will not yield.
15576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who bears this, whatsoever man, he bears a triéd field."
15577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His hand and mine must change some blows.” Achilles laugh’d, and said:"
15578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“If thy will be, Antilochus, I’ll see Eumelus paid"
15579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Out of my tents. I’ll give him th’ arms, which late I conquer’d in"
15580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Asteropæus, forg’d of brass, and wav’d about with tin;"
15581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"‘Twill be a present worthy him.” This said, Automedon"
15582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He sent for them. He went and brought; and to Admetus’ son
15583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles gave them. He, well pleas’d, receiv’d them. Then arose"
15584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wrong’d Menelaus, much incens’d with young Antilochus."
15585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He bent to speak, a herald took his sceptre and gave charge"
15586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of silence to the other Greeks; then did the king enlarge
15587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The spleen he prison’d, utt’ring this: “Antilochus, till now[4]"
15588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We grant thee wise, but in this act what wisdom utter’st thou?"
15589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou hast disgrac’d my virtue, wrong’d my horse, preferring thine"
15590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Much their inferiors. But go to, Princes, nor his nor mine"
15591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Judge of with favour, him nor me; lest any Grecian use"
15592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This scandal: ‘Menelaus won, with Nestor’s son’s abuse,"
15593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prize in question, his horse worst; himself yet wan the best"
15594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By pow’r and greatness.’ Yet, because I would not thus contest"
15595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To make parts taking, I’ll be judge; and I suppose none here"
15596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will blame my judgment, I’ll do right: Antilochus, come near,"
15597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Come, noble gentleman, ’tis your place, swear by th’ earth-circling"
15598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"God,"
15599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Standing before your chariot and horse, and that self rod"
15600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With which you scourg’d them in your hand) if both with will and wile
15601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,You did not cross my chariot.” He thus did reconcile
15602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grace with his disgrace, and with wit restor’d him to his wit:"
15603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Now crave I patience. O king, whatever was unfit;[5]"
15604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ascribe to much more youth in me than you. You, more in age"
15605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And more in excellence, know well, the outrays that engage"
15606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All young men’s actions; sharper wits, but duller wisdoms, still"
15607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From us flow than from you; for which, curb, with your wisdom, will."
15608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prize I thought mine, I yield yours, and, if you please, a prize"
15609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of greater value to my tent I’ll send for, and suffice"
15610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your will at full, and instantly; for, in this point of time,"
15611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I rather wish to be enjoin’d your favour’s top to climb,"
15612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Than to be falling all my time from height of such a grace.[6]
15613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O Jove-lov’d king, and of the Gods receive a curse in place.”"
15614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he fetch’d his prize to him; and it rejoic’d him so,"
15615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That as corn-ears shine with the dew, yet having time to grow,"
15616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When fields set all their bristles up; in such a ruff wert thou.[7]
15617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"O Menelaus, answ’ring thus: “Antilochus, I now,"
15618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though I were angry, yield to thee, because I see th’ hadst wit,"
15619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When I thought not; thy youth hath got the mast’ry of thy spirit.
15620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet, for all this, ’tis more safe not to abuse at all"
15621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great men, than, vent’ring, trust to wit to take up what may fall;"
15622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For no man in our host beside had eas’ly calm’d my spleen,"
15623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Stirr’d with like tempest. But thyself hast a sustainer been
15624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of much affliction in my cause; so thy good father too,"
15625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so thy brother; at thy suit, I therefore let all go,"
15626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Give thee the game here, though mine own, that all these may discern"
15627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,King Menelaus bears a mind at no part proud or stern.”
15628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The king thus calm’d, Antilochus receiv’d, and gave the steed"
15629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To lov’d Noemon to lead thence; and then receiv’d beside
15630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The caldron. Next, Meriones, for fourth game, was to have"
15631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two talents’ gold. The fifth, unwon, renown’d Achilles gave"
15632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To rev’rend Nestor, being a bowl to set on either end;"
15633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which through the press he carried him: “Receive,” said he, “old"
15634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"friend,"
15635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This gift as fun’ral monument of my dear friend deceas’d,"
15636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whom never you must see again. I make it his bequest
15637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To you as, without any strife, obtaining it from all."
15638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Your shoulders must not undergo the churlish whoorlbat’s fall,"
15639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Wrastling is past you, strife in darts, the foot’s celerity;"
15640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Harsh age in his years fetters you, and honour sets you free.”"
15641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus gave he it. He took, and joy’d; but, ere he thank’d, he said:"
15642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Now sure, my honourable son, in all points thou hast play’d"
15643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The comely orator; no more must I contend with nerves;
15644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Feet fail, and hands; arms want that strength, that this and that swing"
15645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,serves
15646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Under your shoulders. Would to heav’n, I were so young chinn’d now,"
15647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And strength threw such a many of bones, to celebrate this show,"
15648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As when the Epians brought to fire, actively honouring thus,"
15649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,King Amaryncea’s funerals in fair Buprasius!
15650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His sons put prizes down for him; where not a man match’d me
15651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all the Epians, or the sons of great-soul’d Ætolie,"
15652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No, nor the Pylians themselves, my countrymen. I beat"
15653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Clytomedeus, Enops’ son, at buffets. At the feat"
15654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of wrastling, I laid under me one that against me rose,"
15655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ancæus, call’d Pleuronius. I made Iphiclus lose"
15656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The foot-game to me. At the spear, I conquer’d Polydore,"
15657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And strong Phylëus. Actor’s sons, of all men, only bore"
15658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The palm at horse-race, conquering with lashing on more horse,"
15659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And envying my victory, because, before their course,"
15660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All the best games were gone with me. These men were twins; one was
15661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A most sure guide, a most sure guide; the other gave the pass"
15662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With rod and mettle. This was then. But now young men must wage
15663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These works, and my joints undergo the sad defects of age;"
15664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Though then I was another man. At that time I excell’d[8]
15665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst th’ heroes. But forth now; let th’ other rites be held
15666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For thy deceas’d friend; this thy gift in all kind part I take,"
15667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And much it joys my heart, that still, for my true kindness’ sake,"
15668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You give me mem’ry. You perceive, in what fit grace I stand"
15669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst the Grecians; and to theirs you set your graceful hand.
15670,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods give ample recompense of grace again to thee,"
15671,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For this and all thy favours!” Thus, back through the thrust drave he,"
15672,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When he had stay’d out all the praise of old Neleides.[9]
15673,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And now for buffets, that rough game, he order’d passages;"
15674,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Proposing a laborious mule, of six years old, untam’d,"
15675,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And fierce in handling, brought, and bound, in that place where they"
15676,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,gam’d;
15677,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, to the conquer’d, a round cup. Both which he thus proclaims:"
15678,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Atrides and all friends of Greece, two men, for these two games,"
15679,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I bid stand forth. Who best can strike, with high contracted fists,"
15680,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"(Apollo giving him the wreath) know all about these lists,"
15681,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall win a mule, patient of toil; the vanquish’d, this round cup.”"
15682,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This utter’d; Panopëus’ son, Epëus, straight stood up,"
15683,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A tall huge man, that to the nail knew that red sport of hand,"
15684,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, seizing the tough mule, thus spake: “Now let some other stand"
15685,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Forth for the cup; this mule is mine, at cuffs I boast me best."
15686,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Is’t not enough I am no soldier? Who is worthiest
15687,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At all works? None; not possible. At this yet this I say,"
15688,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And will perform this: Who stands forth, I’ll burst him, I will bray"
15689,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His bones as in a mortar. Fetch surgeons enow to take[10]
15690,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His corse from under me.” This speech did all men silent make.
15691,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At last stood forth Euryalus, a man god-like, and son"
15692,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To king Mecisteus, the grandchild of honour’d Talaon."
15693,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He was so strong that, coming once to Thebes, when Œdipus"
15694,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had like rites solemniz’d for him, he went victorious"
15695,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From all the Thebans. This rare man Tydides would prepare,"
15696,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put on his girdle, oxhide cords, fair wrought; and spent much care"

15705,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The knock’d earth, no more legs had he; but as a huge fish laid"
15706,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Near to the cold-weed-gath’ring shore, is with a north flaw fraid."
15707,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shoots back, and in the black deep hides; so, sent against the ground,"
15708,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was foil’d Euryalus, his strength so bid in more profound"
15709,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Deeps of Epëus, who took up th’ intranc’d competitor;"
15710,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About whom rush’d a crowd of friends, that through the clusters bore"
15711,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His falt’ring knees, he spitting up thick clods of blood, his head"
15712,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Totter’d of one side, his sense gone; when, to a by-place led,"
15713,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thither they brought him the round cup. Pelides then set forth
15714,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Prize for a wrastling; to the best a trivet, that was worth"
15715,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Twelve oxen, great and fit for fire; the conquer’d was t’ obtain"
15716,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A woman excellent in works; her beauty, and her gain,"
15717,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Priz’d at four oxen. Up he stood, and thus proclaim’d: “Arise,"
15718,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"You wrastlers, that will prove for these.” Out stepp’d the ample size"
15719,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of mighty Ajax, huge in strength; to him Laertes’ son,"
15720,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The crafty one, as huge in sleight. Their ceremony done"
15721,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of making ready, forth they stepp’d, catch elbows with strong hands,"
15722,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as the beams of some high house crack with a storm, yet stands"
15723,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The house, being built by well-skill’d men; so crack’d their backbones,"
15724,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,wrinch’d
15725,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With horrid twitches; in their sides, arms, shoulders, all bepinch’d,"
15726,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ran thick the wales, red with the blood, ready to start out. Both"
15727,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Long’d for the conquest and the prize; yet show’d no play, being loth"
15728,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To lose both. Nor could Ithacus stir Ajax; nor could he
15729,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hale down Ulysses, being more strong than with mere strength to be"
15730,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hurl’d from all vantage of his sleight. Tir’d then with tugging play,"
15731,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Ajax Telamonius said: “Thou wisest man, or lay"
15732,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My face up, or let me lay thine; let Jove take care for these.”"
15733,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he hois’d him up to air; when Laertiades"
15734,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wiles forgat not, Ajax’ thigh he strook behind, and flat"
15735,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,He on his back fell; on his breast Ulysses. Wonder’d at
15736,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was this of all; all stood amaz’d. Then the much-suff’ring man,"
15737,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Divine Ulysses, at next close the Telamonian"
15738,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A little rais’d from earth, not quite, but with his knee implied"
15739,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lock’d legs; and down fell both on earth, close by each other’s side,"
15740,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both fil’d with dust; but starting up, the third close they had made,"
15741,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Had not Achilles’ self stood up, restraining them, and bade:"
15742,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“No more tug one another thus, nor moil yourselves; receive"
15743,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Prize equal; conquest crowns ye both; the lists to others leave.”
15744,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They heard, and yielded willingly, brush’d off the dust, and on"
15745,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Put other vests. Pelides then, to those that swiftest run,"
15746,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Propos’d another prize; a bowl, beyond comparison,"
15747,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both for the size and workmanship, past all the bowls of earth."
15748,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It held six measures; silver all; but had his special worth
15749,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For workmanship, receiving form from those ingenious men"
15750,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Sidon. The Phœnicians made choice, and brought it then"
15751,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Along the green sea, giving it to Thoas; by degrees"
15752,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It came t’ Eunæus, Jason’s son, who young Priamides,"
15753,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lycaon, of Achilles’ friend bought with it; and this here"
15754,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles made best game for him, that best his feet could bear."
15755,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For second he propos’d an ox, a huge one, and a fat;"
15756,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And half a talent gold for last. These thus he set them at:
15757,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Rise, you that will assay for these.” Forth stepp’d Oïliades;"
15758,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ulysses answer’d; and the third was, one esteem’d past these"
15759,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For footmanship, Antilochus. All rank’d, Achilles show’d"
15760,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The race-scope. From the start they glid. Oïliades bestow’d
15761,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His feet the swiftest; close to him flew god-like Ithacus.
15762,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And as a lady at her loom, being young and beauteous,"
15763,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her silk-shuttle close to her breast, with grace that doth inflame,"
15764,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And her white hand, lifts quick and oft, in drawing from her frame"
15765,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her gentle thread, which she unwinds with ever at her breast"
15766,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gracing her fair hand; so close still, and with such interest"
15767,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all men’s likings, Ithacus unwound, and spent the race"
15768,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By him before, took out his steps with putting in their place"
15769,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Promptly and gracefully his own, sprinkled the dust before,"
15770,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And clouded with his breath his head. So facilie he bore
15771,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His royal person, that he strook shouts from the Greeks, with thirst"
15772,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That he should conquer, though he flew: “Yet come, come, O come first,”"
15773,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ever they cried to him. And this ev’n his wise breast did move
15774,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To more desire of victory; it made him pray, and prove,"
15775,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva’s aid, his fautress still: “O Goddess, hear,” said he,"
15776,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“And to my feet stoop with thy help, now happy fautress be.”"
15777,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She was, and light made all his limbs. And now, both near their crown,"
15778,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Minerva tripp’d up Ajax’ heels, and headlong he fell down"
15779,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Amids the ordure of the beasts, there negligently left"
15780,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since they were slain there; and by this, Minerva’s friend bereft"
15781,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Oïliades of that rich bowl, and left his lips, nose, eyes,"
15782,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ruthfully smear’d. The fat ox yet he seiz’d for second prize,"
15783,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Held by the horn, spit out the tail, and thus spake all-besmear’d:"
15784,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,“O villainous chance! This Ithacus so highly is endear’d
15785,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his Minerva, that her hand is ever in his deeds."
15786,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She, like his mother, nestles him; for from her it proceeds,"
15787,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I know, that I am us’d thus.” This all in light laughter cast;"
15788,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Amongst whom quick Antilochus laugh’d out his coming last
15789,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus wittily: “Know, all my friends, that all times past, and now,"
15790,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Gods most honour most-liv’d men. Oïliades ye know
15791,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"More old than I, but Ithacus is of the foremost race,"
15792,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First generation of men. Give the old man his grace,"
15793,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,They count him of the green-hair’d eld; they may; or in his flow’r;
15794,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For not our greatest flourisher can equal him in pow’r
15795,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of foot-strife, but Æacides.” Thus sooth’d he Thetis’ son"
15796,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who thus accepted it: “Well, youth, your praises shall not run"
15797,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With unrewarded feet on mine, your half a talent’s prize"
15798,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll make a whole one. Take you, sir.” He took, and joy’d. Then flies"
15799,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Another game forth. Thetis’ son set in the lists a lance,"
15800,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A shield, and helmet, being th’ arms Sarpedon did advance"
15801,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against Patroclus, and he pris’d. And thus he nam’d th’ address:"
15802,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Stand forth two the most excellent, arm’d, and before all these"
15803,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Give mutual onset to the touch and wound of either’s flesh.
15804,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who first shall wound, through other’s arms his blood appearing fresh,"
15805,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall win this sword, silver’d, and hatch’d; the blade is right of"
15806,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thrace;
15807,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Asteropæus yielded it. These arms shall part their grace
15808,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With either’s valour; and the men I’ll liberally feast
15809,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At my pavilion.” To this game the first man that address’d
15810,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was Ajax Telamonius; to him king Diomed.
15811,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both, in oppos’d parts of the press, full arm’d, both enteréd"
15812,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The lists amids the multitude, put looks on so austere,"
15813,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And join’d so roughly, that amaze surpris’d the Greeks in fear"
15814,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of either’s mischief. Thrice they threw their fierce darts, and clos’d"
15815,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,thrice.
15816,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then Ajax strook through Diomed’s shield, but did no prejudice,"
15817,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His curets saft him. Diomed’s dart still over shoulders flew,"
15818,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Still mounting with the spirit it bore. And now rough Ajax grew
15819,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So violent, that the Greeks cried: “Hold, no more. Let them no more."
15820,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Give equal prize to either.” Yet the sword, propos’d before"
15821,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For him did best, Achilles gave to Diomed. Then a stone,"
15822,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In fashion of a sphere, he show’d; of no inventión,"
15823,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But natural, only melted through with iron. ’Twas the bowl"
15824,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That king Eetion us’d to hurl; but he bereft of soul
15825,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By great Achilles, to the fleet, with store of other prise,"
15826,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He brought it, and propos’d it now both for the exercise"
15827,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And prize itself. He stood, and said: “Rise you that will approve"
15828,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your arms’ strengths now in this brave strife. His vigour that can move
15829,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This furthest, needs no game but this; for reach he ne’er so far"
15830,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With large fields of his own in Greece (and so needs for his car,"
15831,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His plough, or other tools of thrift, much iron) I’ll able this"
15832,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For five revolvéd years; no need shall use his messages
15833,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To any town to furnish him, this only bowl shall yield"
15834,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Iron enough for all affairs.” This said; to try this field,"
15835,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,First Polypœtes issuéd; next Leontëus; third
15836,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Great Ajax; huge Epëus fourth, yet he was first that stirr’d"
15837,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That mine of iron. Up it went, and up he toss’d it so,"
15838,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That laughter took up all the field. The next man that did throw
15839,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was Leontëus; Ajax third, who gave it such a hand,"
15840,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That far past both their marks it flew. But now ’twas to be mann’d
15841,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Polypœtes, and, as far as at an ox that strays"
15842,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A herdsman can swing out his goad, so far did he outraise"
15843,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The stone past all men; all the field rose in a shout to see’t;
15844,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About him flock’d his friends, and bore the royal game to fleet."
15845,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For archery he then set forth ten axes edg’d two ways,"
15846,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And ten of one edge. On the shore, far-off, he caus’d to raise"
15847,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A ship-mast; to whose top they tied a fearful dove by th’ foot,"
15848,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At which all shot, the game put thus; He that the dove could shoot,"
15849,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor touch the string that fasten’d her, the two-edg’d tools should bear"
15850,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All to the fleet. Who touch’d the string, and miss’d the dove, should"
15851,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,share
15852,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The one-edg’d axes. This propos’d; king Teucer’s force arose,"
15853,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And with him rose Meriones. And now lots must dispose
15854,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their shooting first; both which let fall into a helm of brass,"
15855,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First Teucer’s came, and first he shot, and his cross fortune was"
15856,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To shoot the string, the dove untouch’d; Apollo did envy"
15857,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His skill, since not to him he vow’d, being God of archery,"
15858,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A first-fall’n lamb. The bitter shaft yet cut in two the cord,"
15859,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That down fell, and the dove aloft up to the welkin soar’d."
15860,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Greeks gave shouts. Meriones first made a hearty vow
15861,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To sacrifice a first-fall’n lamb to Him that rules the bow,"
15862,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then fell to his aim, his shaft being ready nock’d before."
15863,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He spy’d her in the clouds that here, there, ev’rywhere, did soar,"
15864,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet at her height he reach’d her side, strook her quite through, and"
15865,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,down
15866,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The shaft fell at his feet; the dove the mast again did crown,"
15867,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"There hung the head, and all her plumes were ruffled, she stark dead,"
15868,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And there, far off from him, she fell. The people wonderéd,"
15869,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And stood astonish’d; th’ archer pleas’d. Æacides then shows
15870,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A long lance, and a caldron new, engrail’d with twenty hues,"
15871,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Priz’d at an ox. These games were show’d for men at darts; and then
15872,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up rose the General of all, up rose the King of men,"
15873,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Up rose late-crown’d Meriones. Achilles, seeing the King"
15874,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Do him this grace, prevents more deed, his royal offering"
15875,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus interrupting: “King of men, we well conceive how far"
15876,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy worth superior is to all, how much most singular"
15877,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy pow’r is, and thy skill in darts! Accept then this poor prize"
15878,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without contention, and (your will pleas’d with what I advise)"
15879,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Afford Meriones the lance.” The King was nothing slow
15880,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To that fit grace. Achilles then the brass lance did bestow
15881,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On good Meriones. The King his present would not save,"
15882,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But to renown’d Talthybius the goodly caldron gave.

15997,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Yet, after dues of woes and tears, they bury in his tomb"
15998,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All their deplorings. Fates have giv’n to all that are true men
15999,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,True manly patience; but this man so soothes his bloody vein
16000,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That no blood serves it, he must have divine-soul’d Hector bound"
16001,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his proud chariot, and danc’d in a most barbarous round"
16002,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About his lov’d friend’s sepulchre, when he is slain. ’Tis vile,"
16003,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And draws no profit after it. But let him now awhile
16004,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Mark but our angers; he is spent; let all his strength take heed
16005,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"It tempts not our wraths; he begets, in this outrageous deed,"
16006,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The dull earth with his fury’s hate.” White-wristed Juno said,"
16007,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Being much incens’d, “This doom is one that thou wouldst have obey’d,"
16008,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou bearer of the silver bow, that we in equal care"
16009,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And honour should hold Hector’s worth, with him that claims a share"
16010,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In our deservings. Hector suck’d a mortal woman’s breast,"
16011,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Æacides a Goddess’s; ourself had interest
16012,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Both in his infant nourishment, and bringing up with state,"
16013,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And to the human Peleüs we gave his bridal mate,"
16014,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Because he had th’ Immortals’ love. To celebrate the feast
16015,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of their high nuptials, ev’ry God was glad to be a guest;"
16016,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thou fedd’st of his father’s cates, touching thy harp in grace"
16017,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of that beginning of our friend, whom thy perfidious face,"
16018,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his perfection, blusheth not to match with Priam’s son,"
16019,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,O thou that to betray and shame art still companion!”
16020,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Jove thus receiv’d her: “Never give these broad terms to a God.
16021,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those two men shall not be compar’d; and yet, of all that trod"
16022,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The well-pav’d Ilion, none so dear to all the Deities"
16023,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As Hector was; at least to me, for off’rings most of prize"
16024,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His hands would never pretermit. Our altars ever stood
16025,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Furnish’d with banquets fitting us, odours and ev’ry good"
16026,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Smok’d in our temples; and for this, foreseeing it, his fate"
16027,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We mark’d with honour, which must stand. But, to give stealth estate"
16028,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In his deliv’rance, shun we that; nor must we favour one"
16029,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To shame another. Privily, with wrong to Thetis’ son,"
16030,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"We must not work out Hector’s right. There is a ransom due,"
16031,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And open course, by laws of arms; in which must humbly sue"
16032,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The friends of Hector. Which just mean if any God would stay,"
16033,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And use the other, ’twould not serve; for Thetis night and day"
16034,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is guardian to him. But would one call Iris hither, I"
16035,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would give directions that for gifts the Trojan king should buy
16036,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His Hector’s body, which the son of Thetis shall resign.”"
16037,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, his will was done; the Dame that doth in vapours shine,"
16038,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dewy and thin, footed with storms, jump’d to the sable seas"
16039,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,‘Twixt Samos and sharp Imber’s cliffs; the lake groan’d with the press
16040,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of her rough feet, and, plummet-like, put in an ox’s horn"
16041,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That bears death to the raw-fed fish, she div’d, and found forlorn"
16042,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thetis lamenting her son’s fate, who was in Troy to have,"
16043,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Far from his country, his death serv’d. Close to her Iris stood,"
16044,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And said: “Rise, Thetis, prudent Jove, whose counsels thirst not blood,"
16045,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Calls for thee.” Thetis answer’d her with asking: “What’s the cause
16046,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The great God calls? My sad pow’rs fear’d to break th’ immortal laws,"
16047,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In going fil’d with griefs to heav’n. But He sets snares for none
16048,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With colour’d counsels; not a word of him but shall be done.”
16049,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She said, and took a sable veil (a blacker never wore"
16050,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A heav’nly shoulder) and gave way. Swift Iris swum before.
16051,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About both roll’d the brackish waves. They took their banks, and flew"
16052,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Up to Olympus; where they found Saturnius far-of-view
16053,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Spher’d with heav’n’s ever-being States. Minerva rose, and gave"
16054,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her place to Thetis near to Jove; and Juno did receive
16055,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her entry with a cup of gold, in which she drank to her,"
16056,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grac’d her with comfort, and the cup to her hand did refer."
16057,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"She drank, resigning it; and then the Sire of men and Gods"
16058,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus entertain’d her: “Com’st thou up to these our blest abodes,"
16059,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fair Goddess Thetis, yet art sad; and that in so high kind"
16060,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As passeth suff’rance? This I know, and tried thee, and now find"
16061,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy will by mine rul’d, which is rule to all worlds’ government."
16062,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Besides this trial yet, this cause sent down for thy ascent,"
16063,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nine days’ contention hath been held amongst th’ Immortals here
16064,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For Hector’s person and thy son; and some advices were
16065,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To have our good spy Mercury steal from thy son the corse;
16066,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But that reproach I kept far off, to keep in future force"
16067,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy former love and reverence. Haste then, and tell thy son"
16068,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Gods are angry, and myself take that wrong he hath done"
16069,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Hector in worst part of all, the rather since he still"
16070,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Detains his person. Charge him then, if he respect my will"
16071,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For any reason, to resign slain Hector. I will send"
16072,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Iris to Priam to redeem his son, and recommend"
16073,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fit ransom to Achilles’ grace, in which right he may joy"
16074,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And end his vain grief.” To this charge bright Thetis did employ
16075,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Instant endeavour. From heav’n’s tops she reach’d Achilles’ tent,"
16076,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Found him still sighing, and some friends with all their complement"
16077,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Soothing his humour; other some with all contentión
16078,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dressing his dinner, all their pains and skills consum’d upon"
16079,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A huge wool-bearer, slaughter’d there. His rev’rend mother then"
16080,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Came near, took kindly his fair hand, and ask’d him: “Dear son, when"
16081,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will sorrow leave thee? How long time wilt thou thus eat thy heart,"
16082,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fed with no other food, nor rest? ’Twere good thou wouldst divert"
16083,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy friend’s love to some lady, cheer thy spirits with such kind parts"
16084,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As she can quit thy grace withal. The joy of thy deserts
16085,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I shall not long have, death is near, and thy all-conqu’ring fate,"
16086,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose haste thou must not haste with grief, but understand the state"
16087,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of things belonging to thy life, which quickly order. I"
16088,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Am sent from Jove t’ advértise thee, that ev’ry Deity"
16089,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is angry with thee, himself most, that rage thus reigns in thee"
16090,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Still to keep Hector. Quit him then, and, for fit ransom, free"
16091,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His injur’d person.” He replied: “Let him come that shall give
16092,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The ransom, and the person take. Jove’s pleasure must deprive"
16093,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Men of all pleasures.” This good speech, and many more, the son"
16094,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And mother us’d, in ear of all the naval statión."
16095,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And now to holy Ilion Saturnius Iris sent:
16096,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Go, swift-foot Iris, bid Troy’s king bear fit gifts, and content"
16097,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Achilles for his son’s release; but let him greet alone
16098,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Grecian navy; not a man, excepting such a one"
16099,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As may his horse and chariot guide, a herald, or one old,"
16100,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Attending him; and let him take his Hector. Be he bold,"
16101,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discourag’d nor with death nor fear, wise Mercury shall guide"
16102,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His passage till the prince be near; and, he gone, let him ride"
16103,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Resolv’d ev’n in Achilles’ tent. He shall not touch the state
16104,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his high person, nor admit the deadliest desperate"
16105,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all about him; for, though fierce, he is not yet unwise,"
16106,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor inconsid’rate, nor a man past awe of Deities,"
16107,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,But passing free and curious to do a suppliant grace.”
16108,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,
16109,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, the Rainbow to her feet tied whirlwinds, and the place"
16110,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Reach’d instantly. The heavy court Clamour and Mourning fill’d;
16111,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The sons all set about the sire; and there stood Grief, and still’d"
16112,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Tears on their garments. In the midst the old king sate, his weed"
16113,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All wrinkled, head and neck dust-fil’d; the princesses his seed,"
16114,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The princesses his sons’ fair wives, all mourning by; the thought"
16115,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of friends so many, and so good, being turn’d so soon to nought"
16116,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By Grecian hands, consum’d their youth, rain’d beauty from their eyes."
16117,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Iris came near the king; her sight shook all his faculties,"
16118,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore spake she soft, and said: “Be glad, Dardanides;"
16119,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of good occurrents, and none ill, am I ambassadress."
16120,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove greets thee, who, in care, as much as he is distant, deigns"
16121,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Eye to thy sorrows, pitying thee. My ambassy contains"
16122,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This charge to thee from him: He wills thou shouldst redeem thy son,"
16123,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Bear gifts t’ Achilles, cheer him so; but visit him alone,"
16124,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"None but some herald let attend, thy mules and chariot"
16125,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To manage for thee. Fear nor death let daunt thee, Jove hath got"
16126,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hermes to guide thee, who as near to Thetis’ son as needs"
16127,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall guard thee; and being once with him, nor his, nor others’, deeds"
16128,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Stand touch’d with, he will all contain; nor is he mad, nor vain,"
16129,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor impious, but with all his nerves studious to entertain"
16130,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,One that submits with all fit grace.” Thus vanish’d she like wind.
16131,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He mules and chariot calls, his sons bids see them join’d, and bind"
16132,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A trunk behind it; he himself down to his wardrobe goes,"
16133,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Built all of cedar, highly roof’d, and odoriferous,"
16134,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That much stuff, worth the sight, contain’d. To him he call’d his"
16135,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"queen,"
16136,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus greeting her: “Come, hapless dame, an angel I have seen,"
16137,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sent down from Jove, that bade me free our dear son from the fleet"
16138,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With ransom pleasing to our foe. What holds thy judgment meet?
16139,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My strength and spirit lays high charge on all my being to bear
16140,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks’ worst, vent’ring through their host.” The queen cried out"
16141,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,to hear
16142,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His vent’rous purpose, and replied: “O whither now is fled"
16143,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The late discretion that renown’d thy grave and knowing head
16144,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In foreign and thine own rul’d realms, that thus thou dar’st assay"
16145,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sight of that man, in whose brow sticks the horrible decay"
16146,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of sons so many, and so strong? Thy heart is iron I think."
16147,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If this stern man, whose thirst of blood makes cruelty his drink,"
16148,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Take, or but see, thee, thou art dead. He nothing pities woe,"
16149,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor honours age. Without his sight, we have enough to do"
16150,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To mourn with thought of him. Keep we our palace, weep we here,"
16151,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Our son is past our helps. Those throes, that my deliv’rers were"
16152,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his unhappy lineaments, told me they should be torn"
16153,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With black-foot dogs. Almighty Fate, that black hour he was born,"
16154,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Spun in his springing thread that end; far from his parents’ reach,"
16155,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This bloody fellow then ordain’d to be their mean, this wretch,"
16156,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whose stony liver would to heav’n I might devour, my teeth"
16157,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My son’s revengers made! Curs’d Greek, he gave him not his death"
16158,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Doing an ill work; he alone fought for his country, he"
16159,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fled not, nor fear’d, but stood his worst; and curséd policy"
16160,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was his undoing.” He replied: “Whatever was his end
16161,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is not our question, we must now use all means to defend"
16162,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His end from scandal; from which act dissuade not my just will,"
16163,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor let me nourish in my house a bird presaging ill
16164,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To my good actions; ’tis in vain. Had any earthly spirit
16165,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Giv’n this suggestion, if our priests, or soothsay’rs, challenging"
16166,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,merit
16167,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of prophets, I might hold it false, and be the rather mov’d"
16168,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To keep my palace, but these ears and these self eyes approv’d"
16169,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,It was a Goddess. I will go; for not a word She spake
16170,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I know was idle. If it were, and that my fate will make"
16171,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Quick riddance of me at the fleet, kill me, Achilles; come,"
16172,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"When getting to thee, I shall find a happy dying room"
16173,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On Hector’s bosom, when enough thirst of my tears finds there"
16174,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Quench to his fervour.” This resolv’d, the works most fair and dear"
16175,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of his rich screens he brought abroad; twelve veils wrought curiously;
16176,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Twelve plain gowns; and as many suits of wealthy tapestry;
16177,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As many mantles; horsemen’s coats; ten talents of fine gold;
16178,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two tripods; caldrons four; a bowl, whose value he did hold"
16179,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Beyond all price, presented by th’ ambassadors of Thrace."
16180,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The old king nothing held too dear, to rescue from disgrace"
16181,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His gracious Hector. Forth he came. At entry of his court
16182,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Trojan citizens so press’d, that this opprobrious sort"
16183,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of check he us’d: “Hence, cast-aways! Away, ye impious crew!"
16184,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Are not your griefs enough at home? What come ye here to view?
16185,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Care ye for my griefs? Would ye see how miserable I am?
16186,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Is’t not enough, imagine ye? Ye might know, ere ye came,"
16187,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"What such a son’s loss weigh’d with me. But know this for your pains,"
16188,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Your houses have the weaker doors; the Greeks will find their gains
16189,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The easier for his loss, be sure. But O Troy! ere I see"
16190,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy ruin, let the doors of hell receive and ruin me!”"
16191,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thus with his sceptre set he on the crowding citizens,"
16192,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Who gave back, seeing him so urge. And now he entertains"
16193,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His sons as roughly, Helenus, Paris, Hippothous,"
16194,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pammon, divine Agathones, renown’d Deiphobus,"
16195,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Agavus, and Antiphonus, and last, not least in arms,"
16196,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The strong Polites: these nine sons the violence of his harms
16197,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Help’d him to vent in these sharp terms: “Haste, you infamous brood,"
16198,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And get my chariot. Would to heav’n that all the abject blood
16199,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all your veins had Hector ’scus’d! O me, accurséd man,"
16200,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All my good sons are gone, my light the shades Cimmerian"
16201,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Have swallow’d from me. I have lost Mestor, surnam’d the fair;"
16202,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Troilus, that ready knight at arms, that made his field repair"
16203,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ever so prompt and joyfully; and Hector, amongst men"
16204,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Esteem’d a God, not from a mortal’s seed, but of th’ Eternal strain,"
16205,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He seem’d to all eyes. These are gone, you that survive are base,"
16206,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Liars and common freebooters; all faulty, not a grace,"
16207,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But in your heels, in all your parts; dancing companions"
16208,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ye all are excellent. Hence, ye brats! Love ye to hear my moans?"
16209,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Will ye not get my chariot? Command it quickly, fly,"
16210,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That I may perfect this dear work.” This all did terrify;
16211,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And straight his mule-drawn chariot came, to which they fast did bind"
16212,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The trunk with gifts. And then came forth, with an afflicted mind,"
16213,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Old Hecuba. In her right hand a bowl of gold she bore
16214,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With sweet wine crown’d, stood near, and said: “Receive this, and"
16215,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"implore,"
16216,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With sacrificing it to Jove, thy safe return. I see"
16217,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy mind likes still to go, though mine dislikes it utterly."
16218,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pray to the black-cloud-gath’ring God, Idæan Jove, that views"
16219,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All Troy, and all her miseries, that he will deign to use"
16220,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His most-lov’d bird to ratify thy hopes, that, her broad wing"
16221,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Spread on thy right hand, thou mayst know thy zealous offering"
16222,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Accepted, and thy safe return confirm’d; but if he fail,"
16223,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fail thy intent, though never so it labours to prevail.”"
16224,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“This I refuse not,” he replied, “for no faith is so great"
16225,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Jove’s high favour, but it must with held-up hands intreat.”"
16226,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, the chambermaid, that held the ewer and basin by,"
16227,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He bade pour water on his hands; when, looking to the sky,"
16228,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He took the bowl, did sacrifice, and thus implor’d: “O Jove,"
16229,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From Ida using thy commands, in all deserts above"
16230,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All other Gods, vouchsafe me safe, and pity in the sight"
16231,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of great Achilles; and, for trust to that wish’d grace, excite"
16232,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy swift-wing’d Messenger, most strong, most of air’s region lov’d,"
16233,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To soar on my right hand; which sight may firmly see approv’d
16234,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy former summons, and my speed.” He pray’d, and heav’n’s King heard,"
16235,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And instantly cast from his fist air’s all-commanding bird,"
16236,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The black-wing’d huntress, perfectest of all fowls, which Gods call"
16237,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Percnos, the eagle. And how broad the chamber nuptial"
16238,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of any mighty man hath doors, such breadth cast either wing;"
16239,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which now she us’d, and spread them wide on right hand of the king."
16240,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All saw it, and rejoic’d, and up to chariot he arose,"
16241,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Drave forth, the portal and the porch resounding as he goes."
16242,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His friends all follow’d him, and mourn’d as if he went to die;"
16243,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And bringing him past town to field, all left him; and the eye"
16244,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Jupiter was then his guard, who pitied him, and us’d"
16245,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"These words to Hermes: “Mercury, thy help hath been profus’d"
16246,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ever with most grace in consorts of travellers distress’d,"
16247,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now cónsort Priam to the fleet; but so, that not the least"
16248,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Suspicion of him be attain’d, till at Achilles’ tent"
16249,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The convoy hath arriv’d him safe.” This charge incontinent
16250,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He put in practice. To his feet his feather’d shoes he tied,"
16251,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Immortal, and made all of gold, with which he us’d to ride"
16252,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rough sea and th’ unmeasur’d earth, and equall’d in his pace"
16253,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The puffs of wind. Then took he up his rod, that hath the grace"
16254,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To shut what eyes he lists with sleep, and open them again"
16255,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In strongest trances. This he held, flew forth, and did attain"
16256,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To Troy and Hellespontus straight. Then like a fair young prince,"
16257,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"First-down-chinn’d, and of such a grace as makes his looks convince"
16258,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Contending eyes to view him, forth he went to meet the king."
16259,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He, having pass’d the mighty tomb of Ilus, watering"
16260,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His mules in Xanthus, the dark even fell on the earth; and then"
16261,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Idæus (guider of the mules) discern’d this grace of men,"
16262,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And spake afraid to Priamus: “Beware, Dardanides,"
16263,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our states ask counsel; I discern the dangerous access
16264,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of some man near us; now I fear we perish. Is it best
16265,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To fly, or kiss his knees and ask his ruth of men distress’d?”"
16266,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Confusion strook the king, cold fear extremely quench’d his veins,"
16267,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upright upon his languishing head his hair stood, and the chains"
16268,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of strong amaze bound all his pow’rs. To both which then came near
16269,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The prince turn’d Deity, took his hand, and thus bespake the peer:"
16270,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“To what place, father, driv’st thou out through solitary night,"
16271,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,When others sleep? Give not the Greeks sufficient cause of fright
16272,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To these late travels, being so near, and such vow’d enemies?"
16273,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all which, if with all this load any should cast his eyes"
16274,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On thy adventures, what would then thy mind esteem thy state,"
16275,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thyself old, and thy follow’r old? Resistance could not rate"
16276,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At any value; as for me, be sure I mind no harm"
16277,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thy grave person, but against the hurt of others arm."
16278,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Mine own lov’d father did not get a greater love in me
16279,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his good, than thou dost to thine.” He answer’d: “The degree"
16280,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of danger in my course, fair son, is nothing less than that"
16281,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou urgest; but some God’s fair hand puts in for my safe state,"
16282,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That sends so sweet a guardian in this so stern a time
16283,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of night, and danger, as thyself, that all grace in his prime"
16284,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of body and of beauty show’st, all answer’d with a mind"
16285,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So knowing, that it cannot be but of some blessed kind"
16286,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou art descended.” “Not untrue,” said Hermes, “thy conceit"
16287,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In all this holds; but further truth relate, if of such weight"
16288,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As I conceive thy carriage be, and that thy care conveys"
16289,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy goods of most price to more guard; or go ye all your ways
16290,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Frighted from holy Ilion, so excellent a son"
16291,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As thou hadst (being your special strength) fallen to destructión,"
16292,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Whom no Greek better’d for his fight?” “O, what art thou,” said he,"
16293,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Most worthy youth, of what race born, that thus recount’st to me"
16294,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My wretched son’s death with such truth?” “Now, father,” he replied,"
16295,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“You tempt me far, in wond’ring how the death was signified"
16296,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of your divine son to a man so mere a stranger here
16297,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,As you hold me; but I am one that oft have seen him bear
16298,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His person like a God in field; and when in heaps he slew
16299,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greeks, all routed to their fleet, his so victorious view"
16300,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Made me admire, not feel his hand; because Æacides,"
16301,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Incens’d, admitted not our fight, myself being of access"
16302,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To his high person, serving him, and both to Ilion"
16303,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In one ship sail’d. Besides, by birth I breathe a Myrmidon,"
16304,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Polyctor, call’d the rich, my sire, declin’d with age like you."
16305,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Six sons he hath, and me a seventh; and all those six live now"
16306,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Phthia, since, all casting lots, my chance did only fall"
16307,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To follow hither. Now for walk I left my General.
16308,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To-morrow all the sun-burn’d Greeks will circle Troy with arms,"
16309,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The princes rage to be withheld so idly, your alarms"
16310,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Not giv’n half hot enough they think, and can contain no more.”"
16311,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He answer’d: “If you serve the prince, let me be bold t’ implore"
16312,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This grace of thee, and tell me true: Lies Hector here at fleet,"
16313,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Or have the dogs his flesh?” He said: “Nor dogs nor fowl have yet
16314,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Touch’d at his person; still he lies at fleet, and in the tent"
16315,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of our great Captain, who indeed is much too negligent"
16316,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his fit usage. But, though now twelve days have spent their heat"
16317,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his cold body, neither worms with any taint have eat,"
16318,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor putrefaction perish’d it; yet ever, when the Morn"
16319,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lifts her divine light from the sea, unmercifully borne"
16320,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"About Patroclus’ sepulchre, it bears his friend’s disdain,"
16321,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Bound to his chariot; but no fits of further outrage reign
16322,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In his distemper. You would muse to see how deep a dew
16323,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n steeps the body, all the blood wash’d off, no slend’rest shew"
16324,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of gore or quitture, but his wounds all clos’d, though many were"
16325,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Open’d about him. Such a love the blest Immortals bear,"
16326,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ev’n dead, to thy dear son, because his life show’d love to them.”"
16327,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He joyful answer’d: “O my son, it is a grace supreme"
16328,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In any man to serve the Gods. And I must needs say this;
16329,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For no cause, having season fit, my Hector’s hands would miss"
16330,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Advancement to the Gods with gifts, and therefore do not they"
16331,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Miss his remembrance after death. Now let an old man pray
16332,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy graces to receive this cup, and keep it for my love,"
16333,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nor leave me till the Gods and thee have made my pray’rs approve
16334,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles’ pity, by thy guide brought to his princely tent.”"
16335,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hermes replied: “You tempt me now, old king, to a consent"
16336,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Far from me, though youth aptly errs. I secretly receive"
16337,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gifts that I cannot broadly vouch, take graces that will give"
16338,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My lord dishonour, or what he knows not, or will esteem"
16339,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Perhaps unfit? Such briberies perhaps at first may seem
16340,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sweet and secure; but futurely they still prove sour, and breed"
16341,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Both fear and danger. I could wish thy grave affairs did need
16342,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My guide to Argos, either shipp’d, or lackeying by thy side,"
16343,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And would be studious in thy guard, so nothing could be tried"
16344,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But care in me to keep thee safe, for that I could excuse,"
16345,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And vouch to all men.” These words past, he put the deeds in use"
16346,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For which Jove sent him; up he leapt to Priam’s chariot,"
16347,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Took scourge and reins, and blew in strength to his free steeds, and"
16348,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,got
16349,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The naval tow’rs and deep dike straight. The guards were all at meat;
16350,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Those he enslumber’d, op’d the ports, and in he safely let"
16351,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Old Priam with his wealthy prize. Forthwith they reach’d the tent
16352,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of great Achilles, large and high, and in his most ascent"
16353,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,A shaggy roof of seedy reeds mown from the meads; a hall
16354,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of state they made their king in it, and strengthen’d it withall"
16355,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thick with fir rafters; whose approach was let in by a door
16356,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That had but one bar, but so big that three men evermore"
16357,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Rais’d it to shut, three fresh take down; which yet Æacides"
16358,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Would shut and ope himself. And this with far more ease
16359,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hermes set ope, ent’ring the king; then leapt from horse, and said:"
16360,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Now know, old king, that Mercury, a God, hath giv’n this aid"
16361,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thy endeavour, sent by Jove; and now away must I,"
16362,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For men would envy thy estate to see a Deity
16363,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Affect a man thus. Enter thou, embrace Achilles’ knee,"
16364,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And by his sire, son, mother, pray his ruth and grace to thee.”"
16365,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"This said, he high Olympus reach’d. The king then left his coach"
16366,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To grave Idæus, and went on, made his resolv’d approach,"
16367,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And enter’d in a goodly room, where with his princes sate"
16368,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Jove-lov’d Achilles, at their feast; two only kept the state"
16369,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his attendance, Alcimus, and lord Automedon,"
16370,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,At Priam’s entry. A great time Achilles gaz’d upon
16371,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His wonder’d-at approach, nor ate; the rest did nothing see,"
16372,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"While close he came up, with his hands fast holding the bent knee"
16373,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Hector’s conqueror, and kiss’d that large man-slaught’ring hand"
16374,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That much blood from his sons had drawn. And as in some strange land,"
16375,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And great man’s house, a man is driv’n (with that abhorr’d dismay"
16376,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That follows wilful bloodshed still, his fortune being to slay"
16377,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One whose blood cries aloud for his) to plead protectión,"
16378,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In such a miserable plight as frights the lookers on;
16379,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In such a stupefied estate Achilles sat to see
16380,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So unexpected, so in night, and so incredibly,"
16381,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Old Priam’s entry. All his friends one on another star’d
16382,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To see his strange looks, seeing no cause. Thus Priam then prepar’d"
16383,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His son’s redemption: “See in me, O God-like Thetis’ son,"
16384,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy aged father; and perhaps ev’n now being out-run
16385,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With some of my woes, neighbour foes (thou absent) taking time"
16386,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To do him mischief; no mean left to terrify the crime
16387,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of his oppression; yet he hears thy graces still survive,"
16388,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And joys to hear it, hoping still to see thee safe arrive"
16389,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From ruin’d Troy; but I, curs’d man, of all my race shall live"
16390,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To see none living. Fifty sons the Deities did give
16391,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My hopes to live in; all alive when near our trembling shore
16392,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The Greek ships harbour’d, and one womb nineteen of those sons bore."
16393,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Now Mars a number of their knees hath strength less left; and he
16394,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That was, of all, my only joy, and Troy’s sole guard, by thee,"
16395,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Late fighting for his country, slain; whose tender’d person now"
16396,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I come to ransom. Infinite is that I offer you,"
16397,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Myself conferring it, expos’d alone to all your odds,"
16398,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Only imploring right of arms. Achilles! Fear the Gods,"
16399,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Pity an old man like thy sire; diff’rent in only this,"
16400,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That I am wretcheder, and bear that weight of miseries"
16401,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That never man did, my curs’d lips enforc’d to kiss that hand"
16402,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That slew my children.” This mov’d tears; his father’s name did stand,"
16403,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mention’d by Priam, in much help to his compassion,"
16404,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And mov’d Æacides so much, he could not look upon"
16405,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The weeping father. With his hand he gently put away
16406,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His grave face. Calm remission now did mutually display
16407,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her pow’r in either’s heaviness. Old Priam, to record"
16408,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His son’s death and his deathsman see, his tears and bosom pour’d"
16409,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Before Achilles; at his feet he laid his rev’rend head.
16410,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles’ thoughts, now with his sire, now with his friend, were fed."
16411,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Betwixt both sorrow fill’d the tent. But now Æacides
16412,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(Satiate at all parts with the ruth of their calamities)
16413,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Start up, and up he rais’d the king. His milk-white head and beard"
16414,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With pity he beheld, and said: “Poor man, thy mind is scar’d"
16415,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With much afflictión. How durst thy person thus alone
16416,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Venture on his sight, that hath slain so many a worthy son,"
16417,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And so dear to thee? Thy old heart is made of iron. Sit,"
16418,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And settle we our woes, though huge, for nothing profits it."
16419,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Cold mourning wastes but our lives’ heats. The Gods have destinate
16420,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That wretched mortals must live sad; ’tis the Immortal State
16421,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Deity that lives secure. Two tuns of gifts there lie
16422,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Jove’s gate, one of good, one ill, that our mortality"
16423,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Maintain, spoil, order; which when Jove doth mix to any man,"
16424,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One while he frolics, one while mourns. If of his mournful can"
16425,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A man drinks only, only wrongs he doth expose him to,"
16426,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sad hunger in th’ abundant earth doth toss him to and fro,"
16427,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Respected nor of Gods nor men. The mix’d cup Peleus drank
16428,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Ev’n from his birth; Heav’n blest his life; he liv’d not that could
16429,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,thank
16430,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Gods for such rare benefits as set forth his estate.
16431,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He reign’d among his Myrmidons most rich, most fortunate,"
16432,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, though a mortal, had his bed deck’d with a deathless dame."
16433,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And yet, with all this good, one ill God mix’d, that takes all name"
16434,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"From all that goodness; his name now, whose preservation here"
16435,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Men count the crown of their most good, not bless’d with pow’r to bear"
16436,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"One blossom but myself, and I shaken as soon as blown;"
16437,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor shall I live to cheer his age, and give nutritión"
16438,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To him that nourish’d me. Far off my rest is set in Troy,"
16439,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To leave thee restless and thy seed; thyself that did enjoy,"
16440,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As we have heard, a happy life; what Lesbos doth contain,"
16441,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In times past being a bless’d man’s seat, what the unmeasur’d main"
16442,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Hellespontus, Phrygia, holds, are all said to adorn"
16443,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy empire, wealth and sons enow; but, when the Gods did turn"
16444,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy blest state to partake with bane, war and the bloods of men"
16445,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Circled thy city, never clear. Sit down and suffer then;"
16446,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Mourn not inevitable things; thy tears can spring no deeds
16447,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To help thee, nor recall thy son; impatience ever breeds"
16448,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ill upon ill, makes worst things worse, and therefore sit.” He said:"
16449,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Give me no seat, great seed of Jove, when yet unransomed"
16450,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hector lies riteless in thy tents, but deign with utmost speed"
16451,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His resignation, that these eyes may see his person freed,"
16452,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And thy grace satisfied with gifts. Accept what I have brought,"
16453,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And turn to Phthia; ’tis enough thy conqu’ring hand hath fought
16454,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Till Hector falter’d under it, and Hector’s father stood"
16455,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With free humanity safe.” He frown’d and said: “Give not my blood
16456,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fresh cause of fury. I know well I must resign thy son,"
16457,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Jove by my mother utter’d it; and what besides is done
16458,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I know as amply; and thyself, old Priam, I know too."
16459,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Some God hath brought thee; for no man durst use a thought to go
16460,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On such a service. I have guards, and I have gates to stay"
16461,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Easy accesses; do not then presume thy will can sway,"
16462,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Like Jove’s will, and incense again my quench’d blood, lest nor thou"
16463,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nor Jove get the command of me.” This made the old king bow,"
16464,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And down he sat in fear. The prince leapt like a lion forth,"
16465,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Automedon and Alcimus attending: all the worth
16466,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Brought for the body they took down and brought in, and with it"
16467,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Idæus, herald to the king; a coat embroider’d yet,"
16468,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And two rich cloaks, they left to hide the person. Thetis’ son"
16469,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Call’d out his women, to anoint and quickly overrun"
16470,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The corse with water, lifting it in private to the coach,"
16471,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Lest Priam saw, and his cold blood embrac’d a fi’ry touch"
16472,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of anger at the turpitude profaning it, and blew"
16473,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Again his wrath’s fire to his death. This done, his women threw"
16474,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The coat and cloak on; but the corse Achilles’ own hand laid
16475,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Upon a bed, and with his friends to chariot it convey’d."
16476,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For which forc’d grace, abhorring so from his free mind, he wept,"
16477,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Cried out for anger, and thus pray’d: “O friend, do not except"
16478,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Against this favour to our foe, if in the deep thou hear,"
16479,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And that I give him to his sire; he gave fair ransom; dear
16480,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In my observance is Jove’s will; and whatsoever part
16481,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of all these gifts by any mean I fitly may convert
16482,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To thy renown here, and will there, it shall be pour’d upon"
16483,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy honour’d sepulchre. This said, he went, and what was done"
16484,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Told Priam, saying: “Father, now thy will’s fit rites are paid,"
16485,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Thy son is giv’n up; in the morn thine eyes shall see him laid
16486,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Deck’d in thy chariot on his bed; in mean space let us eat.
16487,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rich-hair’d Niobe found thoughts that made her take her meat,"
16488,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Though twelve dear children she saw slain, six daughters, six young"
16489,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,sons.
16490,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sons incens’d Apollo slew; the maids’ confusions
16491,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Diana wrought; since Niobe her merits durst compare
16492,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With great Latona’s, arguing that she did only bear"
16493,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Two children, and herself had twelve; for which those only two"
16494,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Slew all her twelve. Nine days they lay steep’d in their blood, her woe"
16495,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Found no friend to afford them fire, Saturnius had turn’d"
16496,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Humans to stones. The tenth day yet, the good Celestials burn’d"
16497,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The trunks themselves, and Niobe, when she was tir’d with tears,"
16498,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Fell to her food, and now with rocks and wild hills mix’d she bears"
16499,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In Sipylus the Gods’ wrath still, in that place where ’tis said"
16500,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The Goddess Fairies use to dance about the fun’ral bed
16501,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Achelous, where, though turn’d with cold grief to a stone,"
16502,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Heav’n gives her heat enough to feel what plague comparison
16503,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With his pow’rs made by earth deserves. Affect not then too far
16504,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Without grief, like a God, being a man, but for a man’s life care,"
16505,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And take fit food; thou shalt have time beside to mourn thy son;
16506,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"He shall be tearful, thou being full; not here, but Ilion"
16507,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shall find thee weeping-rooms enow.” He said, and so arose,"
16508,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And caus’d a silver-fleec’d sheep kill’d; his friends’ skills did
16509,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,dispose
16510,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The flaying, cutting of it up, and cookly spitted it,"
16511,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Roasted, and drew it artfully. Automedon, as fit"
16512,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was for the rev’rend sewer’s place; and all the brown joints serv’d
16513,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,On wicker vessel to the board; Achilles’ own hands kerv’d;
16514,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And close they fell to. Hunger stanch’d; talk, and observing time,"
16515,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Was us’d of all hands. Priam sat amaz’d to see the prime
16516,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Thetis’ son, accomplish’d so with stature, looks, and grace,"
16517,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In which the fashion of a God he thought had chang’d his place.
16518,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles fell to him as fast, admir’d as much his years"
16519,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Told in his grave and good aspect; his speech ev’n charm’d his ears,"
16520,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"So order’d, so material. With this food feasted too,"
16521,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Old Priam spake thus: “Now, Jove’s seed, command that I may go,"
16522,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And add to this feast grace of rest. These lids ne’er clos’d mine eyes,"
16523,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Since under thy hands fled the soul of my dear son; sighs, cries,"
16524,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And woes, all use from food and sleep have taken; the base courts"
16525,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of my sad palace made my beds, where all the abject sorts"
16526,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of sorrow I have variéd, tumbled in dust, and hid;"
16527,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"No bit, no drop, of sust’nance touch’d.” Then did Achilles bid"
16528,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His men and women see his bed laid down, and coveréd"
16529,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With purple blankets, and on them an arras coverlid,"
16530,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Waistcoats of silk plush laying by. The women straight took lights,"
16531,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And two beds made with utmost speed, and all the other rites"
16532,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their lord nam’d us’d, who pleasantly the king in hand thus bore:"
16533,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Good father, you must sleep without; lest any counsellor"
16534,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Make his access in depth of night, as oft their industry"
16535,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Brings them t’ impart our war-affairs; of whom should any eye
16536,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Discern your presence, his next steps to Agamemnon fly,"
16537,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And then shall I lose all these gifts. But go to, signify,"
16538,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And that with truth, how many days you mean to keep the state"
16539,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of Hector’s funerals; because so long would I rebate
16540,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Mine own edge set to sack your town, and all our host contain"
16541,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From interruption of your rites.” He answer’d: “If you mean
16542,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To suffer such rites to my son, you shall perform a part"
16543,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Of most grace to me. But you know with how dismay’d a heart
16544,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Our host took Troy; and how much fear will therefore apprehend
16545,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their spirits to make out again, so far as we must send"
16546,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For wood to raise our heap of death; unless I may assure
16547,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That this your high grace will stand good, and make their pass secure;"
16548,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Which if you seriously confirm, nine days I mean to mourn;"
16549,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The tenth keep funeral and feast; th’ eleventh raise and adorn
16550,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"My son’s fit sepulchre; the twelfth, if we must needs, we’ll fight.”"
16551,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Be it,” replied Æacides, “do Hector all this right;"
16552,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"I’ll hold war back those whole twelve days; of which, to free all fear,"
16553,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Take this my right hand.” This confirm’d, the old king rested there;"
16554,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,His herald lodg’d by him; and both in forepart of the tent;
16555,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Achilles in an inmost room of wondrous ornament,"
16556,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Whose side bright-cheek’d Briseis warm’d. Soft sleep tam’d Gods and
16557,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"men,"
16558,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,All but most-useful Mercury; sleep could not lay one chain
16559,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On his quick temples, taking care for getting off again"
16560,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Engagéd Priam undiscern’d of those that did maintain
16561,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,The sacred watch. Above his head he stood with this demand:
16562,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O father, sleep’st thou so secure, still lying in the hand"
16563,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of so much ill, and being dismiss’d by great Æacides?"
16564,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"’Tis true thou hast redeem’d the dead; but for thy life’s release,"
16565,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Should Agamemnon hear thee here, three times the price now paid"
16566,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy sons’ hands must repay for thee.” This said, the king, afraid,"
16567,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Start from his sleep, Idæus call’d, and, for both, Mercury"
16568,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The horse and mules, before loos’d, join’d so soft and curiously"
16569,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"That no ear heard, and through the host drave; but when they drew"
16570,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To gulfy Xanthus’ bright-wav’d stream, up to Olympus flew"
16571,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Industrious Mercury. And now the saffron Morning rose,"
16572,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Spreading her white robe over all the world; when, full of woes,"
16573,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They scourg’d on with the corse to Troy, from whence no eye had seen,"
16574,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Before Cassandra, their return. She, like love’s golden Queen,"
16575,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ascending Pergamus, discern’d her father’s person nigh,"
16576,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His herald, and her brother’s corse; and then she cast this cry"
16577,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Round about Troy: “O Trojans, if ever ye did greet"
16578,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Hector return’d from fight alive, now look ye out and meet"
16579,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His ransom’d person. Then his worth was all your city’s joy,"
16580,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Now do it honour.” Out all rush’d; woman nor man in Troy
16581,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Was left, a most unmeasur’d cry took up their voices. Close"
16582,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To Scæa’s ports they met the corse; and to it headlong goes
16583,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The rev’rend mother, the dear wife; upon it strow their hair,"
16584,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And lie entrancéd. Round about the people broke the air
16585,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"In lamentations; and all day had stay’d the people there,"
16586,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"If Priam had not cried “Give way, give me but leave to bear"
16587,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The body home, and mourn your fills.” Then cleft the press, and gave"
16588,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Way to the chariot. To the court herald Idæus drave
16589,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Where on a rich bed they bestow’d the honour’d person, round"
16590,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Girt it with singers that the woe with skilful voices crown’d.
16591,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A woeful elegy they sung, wept singing, and the dames"
16592,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Sigh’d as they sung. Andromache the downright prose exclaims
16593,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Began to all; she on the neck of slaughter’d Hector fell,"
16594,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And cried out: “O my husband, thou in youth bad’st youth farewell,"
16595,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Left’st me a widow, thy sole son an infant; ourselves curs’d"
16596,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In our birth made him right our child: for all my care that nurs’d
16597,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His infancy will never give life to his youth, ere that"
16598,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Troy from her top will be destroy’d; thou guardian of our state,"
16599,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou ev’n of all her strength the strength, thou, that in care wert"
16600,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,past
16601,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her careful mothers of their babes, being gone, how can she last?"
16602,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Soon will the swoln fleet fill her womb with all their servitude,"
16603,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Myself with them, and thou with me, dear son, in labours rude"
16604,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Shalt be employ’d, sternly survey’d by cruel conquerors;"
16605,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Or, rage not suff’ring life so long, some one, whose hate abhors"
16606,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy presence (putting him in mind of his sire slain by thine,"
16607,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"His brother, son, or friend) shall work thy ruin before mine,"
16608,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Toss’d from some tow’r, for many Greeks have ate earth from the hand"
16609,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of thy strong father; in sad fight his spirit was too much mann’d,"
16610,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And therefore mourn his people; we, thy parents, my dear lord,"
16611,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"For that thou mak’st endure a woe, black, and to be abhorr’d."
16612,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of all yet thou hast left me worst, not dying in thy bed,"
16613,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And reaching me thy last-rais’d hand, in nothing counselléd"
16614,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Nothing commanded by that pow’r thou hadst of me to do
16615,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Some deed for thy sake. O for these never will end my woe,"
16616,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Never my tears cease.” Thus wept she, and all the ladies clos’d"
16617,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Her passion with a gen’ral shriek. Then Hecuba dispos’d
16618,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Her thoughts in like words; “O my son, of all mine much most dear,"
16619,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Dear while thou liv’dst too ev’n to Gods, and after death they were"
16620,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Careful to save thee. Being best, thou most wert envied;"
16621,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,My other sons Achilles sold; but thee he left not dead.
16622,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Imber and Samos, the false ports of Lemnos entertain’d"
16623,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their persons; thine, no port but death. Nor there in rest remain’d"
16624,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thy violated corse, the tomb of his great friend was spher’d"
16625,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,With thy dragg’d person; yet from death he was not therefore rear’d
16626,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But, all his rage us’d, so the Gods have tender’d thy dead state,"
16627,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thou liest as living, sweet and fresh, as he that felt the fate"
16628,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of Phœbus’ holy shafts.” These words the queen us’d for her moan,"
16629,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And, next her, Helen held that state of speech and passión:"
16630,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“O Hector, all my brothers more were not so lov’d of me"
16631,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"As thy most virtues. Not my lord I held so dear, as thee,"
16632,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,That brought me hither; before which I would I had been brought
16633,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,To ruin; for what breeds that wish (which is the mischief wrought
16634,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"By my access) yet never found one harsh taunt, one word’s ill,"
16635,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,From thy sweet carriage. Twenty years do now their circles fill
16636,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Since my arrival; all which time thou didst not only bear
16637,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Thyself without check, but all else, that my lord’s brothers were,"
16638,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Their sisters’ lords, sisters themselves, the queen my mother-in-law,"
16639,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,(The king being never but most mild) when thy man’s spirit saw
16640,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Sour and reproachful, it would still reprove their bitterness"
16641,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"With sweet words, and thy gentle soul. And therefore thy decease"
16642,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,I truly mourn for; and myself curse as the wretched cause;
16643,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"All broad Troy yielding me not one, that any human laws"
16644,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Of pity or forgiveness mov’d t’entreat me humanly,"
16645,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But only thee, all else abhorr’d me for my destiny.”"
16646,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,These words made ev’n the commons mourn; to whom the king said:
16647,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"“Friends,"
16648,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Now fetch wood for our fun’ral fire, nor fear the foe intends"
16649,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Ambush, or any violence; Achilles gave his word,"
16650,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"At my dismission, that twelve days he would keep sheath’d his sword,"
16651,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"And all men’s else.” Thus oxen, mules, in chariots straight they put,"
16652,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Went forth and an unmeasur’d pile of sylvan matter cut;
16653,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Nine days employ’d in carriage, but when the tenth morn shin’d"
16654,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"On wretched mortals, then they brought the fit-to-be-divin’d"
16655,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,Forth to be burn’d. Troy swum in tears. Upon the pile’s most height
16656,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"They laid the person, and gave fire. All day it burn’d, all night."
16657,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"But when th’ elev’nth morn let on earth her rosy fingers shine,"
16658,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"The people flock’d about the pile, and first with blackish wine"
16659,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Quench’d all the flames. His brothers then, and friends, the snowy"
16660,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,bones
16661,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Gather’d into an urn of gold, still pouring on their moans."
16662,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Then wrapt they in soft purple veils the rich urn, digg’d a pit,"
16663,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Grav’d it, ramm’d up the grave with stones, and quickly built to it"
16664,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"A sepulchre. But, while that work and all the fun’ral rites"
16665,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"Were in performance, guards were held at all parts, days and nights,"
16666,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,For fear of false surprise before they had impos’d the crown
16667,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,"To these solemnities. The tomb advanc’d once, all the town"
16668,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,In Jove-nurs’d Priam’s Court partook a passing sumptuous feast.
16669,ANOTHER ARGUMENT,And so horse-taming Hector’s rites gave up his soul to rest.
