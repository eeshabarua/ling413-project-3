43,CANTO III,
44,CANTO III,"""THROUGH me you pass into the city of woe:"
45,CANTO III,Through me you pass into eternal pain:
46,CANTO III,Through me among the people lost for aye.
47,CANTO III,Justice the founder of my fabric mov'd:
48,CANTO III,"To rear me was the task of power divine,"
49,CANTO III,"Supremest wisdom, and primeval love."
50,CANTO III,"Before me things create were none, save things"
51,CANTO III,"Eternal, and eternal I endure."
52,CANTO III,
53,CANTO III,"""All hope abandon ye who enter here."""
54,CANTO III,
55,CANTO III,Such characters in colour dim I mark'd
56,CANTO III,Over a portal's lofty arch inscrib'd:
57,CANTO III,"Whereat I thus: ""Master, these words import"
58,CANTO III,"Hard meaning.""  He as one prepar'd replied:"
59,CANTO III,"""Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave;"
60,CANTO III,Here be vile fear extinguish'd. We are come
61,CANTO III,Where I have told thee we shall see the souls
62,CANTO III,"To misery doom'd, who intellectual good"
63,CANTO III,"Have lost.""  And when his hand he had stretch'd forth"
64,CANTO III,"To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer'd,"
65,CANTO III,Into that secret place he led me on.
66,CANTO III,
67,CANTO III,Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans
68,CANTO III,"Resounded through the air pierc'd by no star,"
69,CANTO III,"That e'en I wept at entering.  Various tongues,"
70,CANTO III,"Horrible languages, outcries of woe,"
71,CANTO III,"Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,"
72,CANTO III,"With hands together smote that swell'd the sounds,"
73,CANTO III,"Made up a tumult, that for ever whirls"
74,CANTO III,"Round through that air with solid darkness stain'd,"
75,CANTO III,Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.
76,CANTO III,
77,CANTO III,"I then, with error yet encompass'd, cried:"
78,CANTO III,"""O master!  What is this I hear?  What race"
79,CANTO III,"Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?"""
80,CANTO III,
81,CANTO III,"He thus to me: ""This miserable fate"
82,CANTO III,"Suffer the wretched souls of those, who liv'd"
83,CANTO III,"Without or praise or blame, with that ill band"
84,CANTO III,"Of angels mix'd, who nor rebellious prov'd"
85,CANTO III,"Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves"
86,CANTO III,"Were only.  From his bounds Heaven drove them forth,"
87,CANTO III,"Not to impair his lustre, nor the depth"
88,CANTO III,"Of Hell receives them, lest th' accursed tribe"
89,CANTO III,"Should glory thence with exultation vain."""
90,CANTO III,
91,CANTO III,"I then: ""Master! what doth aggrieve them thus,"
92,CANTO III,"That they lament so loud?""  He straight replied:"
93,CANTO III,"""That will I tell thee briefly.  These of death"
94,CANTO III,No hope may entertain: and their blind life
95,CANTO III,"So meanly passes, that all other lots"
96,CANTO III,"They envy.  Fame of them the world hath none,"
97,CANTO III,Nor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.
98,CANTO III,"Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by."""
99,CANTO III,
100,CANTO III,"And I, who straightway look'd, beheld a flag,"
101,CANTO III,"Which whirling ran around so rapidly,"
102,CANTO III,That it no pause obtain'd: and following came
103,CANTO III,"Such a long train of spirits, I should ne'er"
104,CANTO III,"Have thought, that death so many had despoil'd."
105,CANTO III,
106,CANTO III,"When some of these I recogniz'd, I saw"
107,CANTO III,"And knew the shade of him, who to base fear"
108,CANTO III,"Yielding, abjur'd his high estate.  Forthwith"
109,CANTO III,I understood for certain this the tribe
110,CANTO III,Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing
111,CANTO III,"And to his foes.  These wretches, who ne'er lived,"
112,CANTO III,"Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung"
113,CANTO III,"By wasps and hornets, which bedew'd their cheeks"
114,CANTO III,"With blood, that mix'd with tears dropp'd to their feet,"
115,CANTO III,And by disgustful worms was gather'd there.
116,CANTO III,
117,CANTO III,Then looking farther onwards I beheld
118,CANTO III,A throng upon the shore of a great stream:
119,CANTO III,"Whereat I thus: ""Sir! grant me now to know"
120,CANTO III,"Whom here we view, and whence impell'd they seem"
121,CANTO III,"So eager to pass o'er, as I discern"
122,CANTO III,"Through the blear light?""  He thus to me in few:"
123,CANTO III,"""This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive"
124,CANTO III,"Beside the woeful tide of Acheron."""
125,CANTO III,
126,CANTO III,"Then with eyes downward cast and fill'd with shame,"
127,CANTO III,"Fearing my words offensive to his ear,"
128,CANTO III,"Till we had reach'd the river, I from speech"
129,CANTO III,Abstain'd.  And lo! toward us in a bark
130,CANTO III,"Comes on an old man hoary white with eld,"
131,CANTO III,
132,CANTO III,"Crying, ""Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not"
133,CANTO III,Ever to see the sky again.  I come
134,CANTO III,"To take you to the other shore across,"
135,CANTO III,"Into eternal darkness, there to dwell"
136,CANTO III,"In fierce heat and in ice.  And thou, who there"
137,CANTO III,"Standest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave"
138,CANTO III,"These who are dead.""  But soon as he beheld"
139,CANTO III,"I left them not, ""By other way,"" said he,"
140,CANTO III,"""By other haven shalt thou come to shore,"
141,CANTO III,Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat
142,CANTO III,"Must carry.""  Then to him thus spake my guide:"
143,CANTO III,"""Charon! thyself torment not: so 't is will'd,"
144,CANTO III,"Where will and power are one: ask thou no more."""
145,CANTO III,
146,CANTO III,Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks
147,CANTO III,"Of him the boatman o'er the livid lake,"
148,CANTO III,Around whose eyes glar'd wheeling flames.  Meanwhile
149,CANTO III,"Those spirits, faint and naked, color chang'd,"
150,CANTO III,"And gnash'd their teeth, soon as the cruel words"
151,CANTO III,"They heard.  God and their parents they blasphem'd,"
152,CANTO III,"The human kind, the place, the time, and seed"
153,CANTO III,That did engender them and give them birth.
154,CANTO III,
155,CANTO III,Then all together sorely wailing drew
156,CANTO III,"To the curs'd strand, that every man must pass"
157,CANTO III,"Who fears not God.  Charon, demoniac form,"
158,CANTO III,"With eyes of burning coal, collects them all,"
159,CANTO III,"Beck'ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar"
160,CANTO III,"Strikes.  As fall off the light autumnal leaves,"
161,CANTO III,"One still another following, till the bough"
162,CANTO III,Strews all its honours on the earth beneath;
163,CANTO III,
164,CANTO III,E'en in like manner Adam's evil brood
165,CANTO III,"Cast themselves one by one down from the shore,"
166,CANTO III,"Each at a beck, as falcon at his call."
167,CANTO III,
168,CANTO III,"Thus go they over through the umber'd wave,"
169,CANTO III,And ever they on the opposing bank
170,CANTO III,"Be landed, on this side another throng"
171,CANTO III,"Still gathers.  ""Son,"" thus spake the courteous guide,"
172,CANTO III,"""Those, who die subject to the wrath of God,"
173,CANTO III,"All here together come from every clime,"
174,CANTO III,And to o'erpass the river are not loth:
175,CANTO III,"For so heaven's justice goads them on, that fear"
176,CANTO III,Is turn'd into desire.  Hence ne'er hath past
177,CANTO III,"Good spirit.  If of thee Charon complain,"
178,CANTO III,"Now mayst thou know the import of his words."""
179,CANTO III,
180,CANTO III,"This said, the gloomy region trembling shook"
181,CANTO III,"So terribly, that yet with clammy dews"
182,CANTO III,"Fear chills my brow.  The sad earth gave a blast,"
183,CANTO III,"That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame,"
184,CANTO III,"Which all my senses conquer'd quite, and I"
185,CANTO III,"Down dropp'd, as one with sudden slumber seiz'd."
186,CANTO III,
187,CANTO III,
188,CANTO III,
189,CANTO III,
190,CANTO IV,CANTO IV
191,CANTO IV,
192,CANTO IV,BROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash
193,CANTO IV,"Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself,"
194,CANTO IV,"As one by main force rous'd.  Risen upright,"
195,CANTO IV,"My rested eyes I mov'd around, and search'd"
196,CANTO IV,"With fixed ken to know what place it was,"
197,CANTO IV,Wherein I stood.  For certain on the brink
198,CANTO IV,"I found me of the lamentable vale,"
199,CANTO IV,"The dread abyss, that joins a thund'rous sound"
200,CANTO IV,"Of plaints innumerable.  Dark and deep,"
201,CANTO IV,"And thick with clouds o'erspread, mine eye in vain"
202,CANTO IV,"Explor'd its bottom, nor could aught discern."
203,CANTO IV,
204,CANTO IV,"""Now let us to the blind world there beneath"
205,CANTO IV,"Descend;"" the bard began all pale of look:"
206,CANTO IV,"""I go the first, and thou shalt follow next."""
207,CANTO IV,
208,CANTO IV,"Then I his alter'd hue perceiving, thus:"
209,CANTO IV,"""How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,"
210,CANTO IV,"Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?"""
211,CANTO IV,
212,CANTO IV,"He then: ""The anguish of that race below"
213,CANTO IV,"With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear"
214,CANTO IV,Mistakest.  Let us on.  Our length of way
215,CANTO IV,"Urges to haste.""  Onward, this said, he mov'd;"
216,CANTO IV,And ent'ring led me with him on the bounds
217,CANTO IV,"Of the first circle, that surrounds th' abyss."
218,CANTO IV,"Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard"
219,CANTO IV,"Except of sighs, that made th' eternal air"
220,CANTO IV,"Tremble, not caus'd by tortures, but from grief"
221,CANTO IV,"Felt by those multitudes, many and vast,"
222,CANTO IV,"Of men, women, and infants.  Then to me"
223,CANTO IV,"The gentle guide: ""Inquir'st thou not what spirits"
224,CANTO IV,"Are these, which thou beholdest?  Ere thou pass"
225,CANTO IV,"Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin"
226,CANTO IV,"Were blameless; and if aught they merited,"
227,CANTO IV,"It profits not, since baptism was not theirs,"
228,CANTO IV,The portal to thy faith.  If they before
229,CANTO IV,"The Gospel liv'd, they serv'd not God aright;"
230,CANTO IV,"And among such am I. For these defects,"
231,CANTO IV,"And for no other evil, we are lost;"""
232,CANTO IV,
233,CANTO IV,"""Only so far afflicted, that we live"
234,CANTO IV,"Desiring without hope.""  So grief assail'd"
235,CANTO IV,"My heart at hearing this, for well I knew"
236,CANTO IV,Suspended in that Limbo many a soul
237,CANTO IV,"Of mighty worth.  ""O tell me, sire rever'd!"
238,CANTO IV,"Tell me, my master!""  I began through wish"
239,CANTO IV,"Of full assurance in that holy faith,"
240,CANTO IV,"Which vanquishes all error; ""say, did e'er"
241,CANTO IV,"Any, or through his own or other's merit,"
242,CANTO IV,"Come forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?"""
243,CANTO IV,
244,CANTO IV,"Piercing the secret purport of my speech,"
245,CANTO IV,"He answer'd: ""I was new to that estate,"
246,CANTO IV,When I beheld a puissant one arrive
247,CANTO IV,"Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown'd."
248,CANTO IV,"He forth the shade of our first parent drew,"
249,CANTO IV,"Abel his child, and Noah righteous man,"
250,CANTO IV,"Of Moses lawgiver for faith approv'd,"
251,CANTO IV,"Of patriarch Abraham, and David king,"
252,CANTO IV,"Israel with his sire and with his sons,"
253,CANTO IV,"Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won,"
254,CANTO IV,"And others many more, whom he to bliss"
255,CANTO IV,"Exalted.  Before these, be thou assur'd,"
256,CANTO IV,"No spirit of human kind was ever sav'd."""
257,CANTO IV,
258,CANTO IV,"We, while he spake, ceas'd not our onward road,"
259,CANTO IV,Still passing through the wood; for so I name
260,CANTO IV,Those spirits thick beset.  We were not far
261,CANTO IV,"On this side from the summit, when I kenn'd"
262,CANTO IV,"A flame, that o'er the darken'd hemisphere"
263,CANTO IV,Prevailing shin'd.  Yet we a little space
264,CANTO IV,"Were distant, not so far but I in part"
265,CANTO IV,"Discover'd, that a tribe in honour high"
266,CANTO IV,"That place possess'd.  ""O thou, who every art"
267,CANTO IV,"And science valu'st! who are these, that boast"
268,CANTO IV,"Such honour, separate from all the rest?"""
269,CANTO IV,
270,CANTO IV,"He answer'd: ""The renown of their great names"
271,CANTO IV,"That echoes through your world above, acquires"
272,CANTO IV,"Favour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc'd."""
273,CANTO IV,"Meantime a voice I heard: ""Honour the bard"
274,CANTO IV,"Sublime! his shade returns that left us late!"""
275,CANTO IV,"No sooner ceas'd the sound, than I beheld"
276,CANTO IV,"Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,"
277,CANTO IV,Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.
278,CANTO IV,
279,CANTO IV,"When thus my master kind began: ""Mark him,"
280,CANTO IV,"Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen,"
281,CANTO IV,"The other three preceding, as their lord."
282,CANTO IV,"This is that Homer, of all bards supreme:"
283,CANTO IV,Flaccus the next in satire's vein excelling;
284,CANTO IV,The third is Naso; Lucan is the last.
285,CANTO IV,"Because they all that appellation own,"
286,CANTO IV,"With which the voice singly accosted me,"
287,CANTO IV,"Honouring they greet me thus, and well they judge."""
288,CANTO IV,
289,CANTO IV,So I beheld united the bright school
290,CANTO IV,"Of him the monarch of sublimest song,"
291,CANTO IV,That o'er the others like an eagle soars.
292,CANTO IV,"When they together short discourse had held,"
293,CANTO IV,"They turn'd to me, with salutation kind"
294,CANTO IV,Beck'ning me; at the which my master smil'd:
295,CANTO IV,Nor was this all; but greater honour still
296,CANTO IV,"They gave me, for they made me of their tribe;"
297,CANTO IV,And I was sixth amid so learn'd a band.
298,CANTO IV,
299,CANTO IV,Far as the luminous beacon on we pass'd
300,CANTO IV,"Speaking of matters, then befitting well"
301,CANTO IV,"To speak, now fitter left untold.  At foot"
302,CANTO IV,"Of a magnificent castle we arriv'd,"
303,CANTO IV,"Seven times with lofty walls begirt, and round"
304,CANTO IV,Defended by a pleasant stream.  O'er this
305,CANTO IV,As o'er dry land we pass'd.  Next through seven gates
306,CANTO IV,"I with those sages enter'd, and we came"
307,CANTO IV,Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.
308,CANTO IV,
309,CANTO IV,"There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around"
310,CANTO IV,"Majestically mov'd, and in their port"
311,CANTO IV,Bore eminent authority; they spake
312,CANTO IV,"Seldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet."
313,CANTO IV,
314,CANTO IV,"We to one side retir'd, into a place"
315,CANTO IV,"Open and bright and lofty, whence each one"
316,CANTO IV,Stood manifest to view.  Incontinent
317,CANTO IV,There on the green enamel of the plain
318,CANTO IV,"Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight"
319,CANTO IV,I am exalted in my own esteem.
320,CANTO IV,
321,CANTO IV,Electra there I saw accompanied
322,CANTO IV,"By many, among whom Hector I knew,"
323,CANTO IV,"Anchises' pious son, and with hawk's eye"
324,CANTO IV,"Caesar all arm'd, and by Camilla there"
325,CANTO IV,Penthesilea.  On the other side
326,CANTO IV,"Old King Latinus, seated by his child"
327,CANTO IV,"Lavinia, and that Brutus I beheld,"
328,CANTO IV,"Who Tarquin chas'd, Lucretia, Cato's wife"
329,CANTO IV,"Marcia, with Julia and Cornelia there;"
330,CANTO IV,"And sole apart retir'd, the Soldan fierce."
331,CANTO IV,
332,CANTO IV,"Then when a little more I rais'd my brow,"
333,CANTO IV,"I spied the master of the sapient throng,"
334,CANTO IV,Seated amid the philosophic train.
335,CANTO IV,"Him all admire, all pay him rev'rence due."
336,CANTO IV,"There Socrates and Plato both I mark'd,"
337,CANTO IV,"Nearest to him in rank; Democritus,"
338,CANTO IV,"Who sets the world at chance, Diogenes,"
339,CANTO IV,"With Heraclitus, and Empedocles,"
340,CANTO IV,"And Anaxagoras, and Thales sage,"
341,CANTO IV,"Zeno, and Dioscorides well read"
342,CANTO IV,In nature's secret lore.  Orpheus I mark'd
343,CANTO IV,"And Linus, Tully and moral Seneca,"
344,CANTO IV,"Euclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrates,"
345,CANTO IV,"Galenus, Avicen, and him who made"
346,CANTO IV,"That commentary vast, Averroes."
347,CANTO IV,
348,CANTO IV,Of all to speak at full were vain attempt;
349,CANTO IV,"For my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes"
350,CANTO IV,My words fall short of what bechanc'd.  In two
351,CANTO IV,The six associates part.  Another way
352,CANTO IV,"My sage guide leads me, from that air serene,"
353,CANTO IV,Into a climate ever vex'd with storms:
354,CANTO IV,And to a part I come where no light shines.
