69,PREFACE.,
70,PREFACE.,
71,PREFACE.,The following work consists in some measure of matter already
72,PREFACE.,published in England and Italy during the last six years. The original
73,PREFACE.,"publications were in the _Athenæum_, Jan. 30 and Feb. 20, 1892, and in"
74,PREFACE.,"the _Eagle_ for the Lent Term, 1892, and for the October Term, 1892."
75,PREFACE.,Both these last two articles were re-published by Messrs. Metcalfe &
76,PREFACE.,"Co. of Cambridge, with prefaces, in the second case of considerable"
77,PREFACE.,length. I have also drawn from sundry letters and articles that
78,PREFACE.,"appeared in _Il Lambruschini_, a journal published at Trapani and"
79,PREFACE.,"edited by Prof. Giacalone-Patti, in 1892 and succeeding years, as also"
80,PREFACE.,from two articles that appeared in the _Rassegna della Letteratura
81,PREFACE.,"Siciliana_, published at Acireale in the autumn of 1893 and of 1894,"
82,PREFACE.,and from some articles published in the _Italian Gazette_ (then edited
83,PREFACE.,by Miss Helen Zimmern) in the spring of 1895.
84,PREFACE.,
85,PREFACE.,Each of the publications above referred to contained some matter
86,PREFACE.,"which did not appear in the others, and by the help of local students"
87,PREFACE.,"in Sicily, among whom I would name the late Signor E. Biaggini of"
88,PREFACE.,"Trapani, Signor Sugameli of Trapani, and Cavaliere Professore Ingroia"
89,PREFACE.,"of Calatafimi, I have been able to correct some errors and become"
90,PREFACE.,possessed of new matter bearing on my subject. I have now entirely
91,PREFACE.,"re-cast and re-stated the whole argument, adding much that has not"
92,PREFACE.,"appeared hitherto, and dealing for the first time fully with the"
93,PREFACE.,question of the writer's sex.
94,PREFACE.,
95,PREFACE.,No reply appeared to either of my letters to the _Athenœum_ nor to my
96,PREFACE.,Italian pamphlets. It is idle to suppose that the leading Iliadic and
97,PREFACE.,Odyssean scholars in England and the continent do not know what I have
98,PREFACE.,said. I have taken ample care that they should be informed concerning
99,PREFACE.,it. It is equally idle to suppose that not one of them should have
100,PREFACE.,"brought forward a serious argument against me, if there were any such"
101,PREFACE.,"argument to bring. Had they brought one it must have reached me, and I"
102,PREFACE.,"should have welcomed it with great pleasure; for, as I have said in my"
103,PREFACE.,"concluding Chapter, I do not care whether the _Odyssey_ was written by"
104,PREFACE.,"man or by woman, nor yet where the poet or poetess lived who wrote it;"
105,PREFACE.,all I care about is the knowing as much as I can about the poem; and I
106,PREFACE.,believe that scholars both in England and on the continent would have
107,PREFACE.,helped me to fuller understanding if they had seen their way to doing
108,PREFACE.,so.
109,PREFACE.,
110,PREFACE.,"A new edition, for example, of Professor Jebb's _Introduction to Homer_"
111,PREFACE.,was published some six weeks after the first and more important of my
112,PREFACE.,"letters to the _Athenœum_ had appeared. It was advertised as ""this"
113,PREFACE.,"day"" in the _Athenœum_ of March 12, 1892; so that if Professor Jebb had"
114,PREFACE.,"wished to say anything against what had appeared in the _Athenœum_, he"
115,PREFACE.,had ample time to do so by way of postscript. I know very well what I
116,PREFACE.,"should have thought it incumbent upon me to do had I been in his place,"
117,PREFACE.,and found his silence more eloquent on my behalf than any words would
118,PREFACE.,"have been which he is at all likely to have written, or, I may add, to"
119,PREFACE.,write.
120,PREFACE.,
121,PREFACE.,I repeat that nothing deserving serious answer has reached me from any
122,PREFACE.,"source during the six years, or so, that my Odyssean theories have been"
123,PREFACE.,before the public. The principal notices of them that have appeared so
124,PREFACE.,"far will be found in the _Spectator_, April 23, 1892; the _Cambridge"
125,PREFACE.,"Observer_, May 31, 1892; the _Classical Review_ for November, 1892,"
126,PREFACE.,"June, 1893, and February, 1895, and _Longman's Magazine_ (see _At the"
127,PREFACE.,"Sign of the Ship_) for June, 1892."
128,PREFACE.,
129,PREFACE.,My frontispiece is taken by the kind permission of the Messrs. Alinari
130,PREFACE.,"of Florence, from their photograph of a work in the museum at Cortona"
131,PREFACE.,"called _La Musa Polinnia_. It is on slate and burnt, is a little more"
132,PREFACE.,"than half life size, and is believed to be Greek, presumably of about"
133,PREFACE.,"the Christian era, but no more precise date can be assigned to it. I"
134,PREFACE.,was assured at Cortona that it was found by a man who was ploughing his
135,PREFACE.,"field, and who happened to be a baker. The size being suitable he used"
136,PREFACE.,"it for some time as a door for his oven, whence it was happily rescued"
137,PREFACE.,and placed in the museum where it now rests.
138,PREFACE.,
139,PREFACE.,As regards the Greek text from which I have taken my abridged
140,PREFACE.,"translation, I have borne in mind throughout the admirable canons laid"
141,PREFACE.,"down by Mr. Gladstone in his _Studies in Homer_, Oxford University"
142,PREFACE.,"Press, 1858, Vol. I., p. 43. He holds:--"
143,PREFACE.,
144,PREFACE.,1. That we should adopt the text itself as the basis of all Homeric
145,PREFACE.,"enquiry, and not any preconceived theory nor any arbitrary standard of"
146,PREFACE.,"criticism, referable to any particular periods, schools, or persons."
147,PREFACE.,
148,PREFACE.,"2. That as we proceed in any work of construction drawn from the text,"
149,PREFACE.,we should avoid the temptation to solve difficulties that lie in our
150,PREFACE.,way by denouncing particular portions of it as corrupt or interpolated;
151,PREFACE.,should never set it aside except on the closest examination of the
152,PREFACE.,particular passage questioned; should use sparingly the liberty of even
153,PREFACE.,arraying presumptions against it; and should always let the reader
154,PREFACE.,understand both when and why it is questioned.
155,PREFACE.,
156,PREFACE.,The only emendation I have ventured to make in the text is to read
157,PREFACE.,Νηρίτῳ instead of Νηίῳ in i. 186 and ὑπονηρίτου for ὑπονηίου in iii.
158,PREFACE.,"81. A more speculative emendation in iv. 606, 607 I forbear even to"
159,PREFACE.,suggest. I know of none others that I have any wish to make. As for
160,PREFACE.,interpolations I have called attention to three or four which I believe
161,PREFACE.,"to have been made at a later period by the writer herself, but have"
162,PREFACE.,seen no passage which I have been tempted to regard as the work of
163,PREFACE.,another hand.
164,PREFACE.,
165,PREFACE.,"I have followed Mr. Gladstone, Lord Derby, Colonel Mure, and I may"
166,PREFACE.,"add the late Professor Kennedy and the Rev. Richard Shilleto, men"
167,PREFACE.,"who taught me what little Greek I know, in retaining the usual Latin"
168,PREFACE.,renderings of Greek proper names. What was good enough for the scholars
169,PREFACE.,"whom I have named is good enough for me, and I should think also for"
170,PREFACE.,the greater number of my readers. The public whom I am addressing
171,PREFACE.,"know the _Odyssey_ chiefly through Pope's translation, and will not,"
172,PREFACE.,"I believe, take kindly to Odysseus for Ulysses, Aias for Ajax, and"
173,PREFACE.,Polydeukes for Pollux. Neither do I think that Hekabe will supersede
174,PREFACE.,"Hecuba, till"
175,PREFACE.,
176,PREFACE.,"""What's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba?"""
177,PREFACE.,
178,PREFACE.,is out of date.
179,PREFACE.,
180,PREFACE.,I infer that the authorities of the British Museum are with me in this
181,PREFACE.,"matter, for on looking out Odysseus in the catalogue of the library I"
182,PREFACE.,"find ""See Ulysses."""
183,PREFACE.,
184,PREFACE.,Moreover the authors of this new nomenclature are not consistent. Why
185,PREFACE.,not call Penelope Penelopeia? She is never called anything else in
186,PREFACE.,"the _Odyssey_. Why not Achilleus? Why not Bellerophontes? Why Hades,"
187,PREFACE.,when Ἀίδης has no aspirate? Why Helios instead of Eëlios? Why insist
188,PREFACE.,"on Achaians and Aitolians, but never on Aithiopians? Why not Athenæans"
189,PREFACE.,"rather than Athenians? Why not Apollon? Why not either Odusseus, or"
190,PREFACE.,else Odysseys? and why not call him Oduseus or Odyseys whenever the
191,PREFACE.,_Odyssey_ does so?
192,PREFACE.,
193,PREFACE.,Admitting that the Greek names for gods and heroes may one day become
194,PREFACE.,"as familiar as the Latin ones, they have not become so yet, nor shall"
195,PREFACE.,"I believe that they have done so, till I have seen Odysseus supplant"
196,PREFACE.,"Ulysses on railway engines, steam tugs, and boats or ships. Jove,"
197,PREFACE.,"Mercury, Minerva, Juno, and Venus convey a sufficiently accurate idea"
198,PREFACE.,"to people who would have no ready made idea in connection with Zeus,"
199,PREFACE.,"Hermes, Athene, Here, and Aphrodite. The personalities of the Latin"
200,PREFACE.,"gods do not differ so much from those of the Greek, as, for example,"
201,PREFACE.,the Athene of the _Iliad_ does from the Athene of the _Odyssey_.
202,PREFACE.,The personality of every god varies more or less with that of every
203,PREFACE.,"writer, and what little difference may exist between Greek and Roman"
204,PREFACE.,"ideas of Jove, Juno, &c., is not sufficient to warrant the disturbance"
205,PREFACE.,of a nomenclature that has long since taken an established place in
206,PREFACE.,literature.
207,PREFACE.,
208,PREFACE.,"Furthermore, the people who are most shocked by the use of Latin names"
209,PREFACE.,"for Greek gods and heroes, and who most insist on the many small"
210,PREFACE.,innovations which any one who opens a volume of the _Classical Review_
211,PREFACE.,"may discover for himself, are the very ones who have done most to foist"
212,PREFACE.,"Wolf and German criticism upon us, and who are most tainted with that"
213,PREFACE.,"affectation of higher critical taste and insight, which men of the"
214,PREFACE.,"world distrust, and which has brought the word ""academic"" into use"
215,PREFACE.,as expressive of everything which sensible people will avoid. I dare
216,PREFACE.,"not, therefore, follow these men till time has shown whether they are"
217,PREFACE.,"faddists or no. Nevertheless, if I find the opinion of those whom I"
218,PREFACE.,"respect goes against me in this matter, I shall adopt the Greek names"
219,PREFACE.,in any new edition of my book that may be asked for. I need hardly say
220,PREFACE.,that I have consulted many excellent scholars as to which course I
221,PREFACE.,"should take, and have found them generally, though not always, approve"
222,PREFACE.,of my keeping to the names with which Pope and others have already
223,PREFACE.,familiarised the public.
224,PREFACE.,
225,PREFACE.,"Since Chapter XIV. was beyond reach of modification, I have asked the"
226,PREFACE.,authorities of the British Museum to accept a copy of the _Odyssey_
227,PREFACE.,with all the Iliadic passages underlined and referred to in M.S. I
228,PREFACE.,have every reason to believe that this will very shortly be indexed
229,PREFACE.,"under my name, and (I regret to say) also under that of Homer. It"
230,PREFACE.,is my intention within the next few weeks to offer the Museum an
231,PREFACE.,_Iliad_ with all passages borrowed by the writer of the _Odyssey_
232,PREFACE.,underlined--reference being given to the Odyssean passage in which they
233,PREFACE.,occur.
234,PREFACE.,
235,PREFACE.,"Lastly, I would express my great obligations to my friend Mr."
236,PREFACE.,"H. Festing Jones, who in two successive years has verified all"
237,PREFACE.,"topographical details on the ground itself, and to whom I have referred"
238,PREFACE.,throughout my work whenever I have been in doubt or difficulty.

247,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
248,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
249,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"It may be said that we owe this book, <i>The Authoress of the Odyssey</i>,"
250,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"to Charles Lamb. Butler, in his early days, had read all the usual"
251,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"English classics that young people read--Dickens, Tennyson, Thackeray,"
252,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Scott, Lamb, and so on; as he grew older, however, he became more"
253,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,absorbed in his own work and had no time for general reading. When
254,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"people allege want of time as an excuse for not doing something,"
255,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,they are usually trying to conceal their laziness. But laziness
256,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,was not the reason why Butler refused to read books except for the
257,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,purpose of whatever he was writing. It was that he was a martyr to
258,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"self-indulgence, and the sin that did most easily beset him was"
259,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"over-work. He was St. Anthony, and the world of books was his desert,"
260,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,full of charming appearances assumed by demons who were bent on luring
261,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"him to perdition. His refusal was not the cry of the slothful: ""Yet"
262,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to"
263,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"sleep""; it was the ""Get thee behind me, Satan!"" of one who is seeking"
264,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,salvation. For he knew his weakness and that temptation comes in such
265,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,unexpected shapes that the only way of escape is by perpetual watching
266,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"and praying lest we fall. So he watched and prayed, and kept his powder"
267,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"dry by minding his own business. The Devil, how- ever, was on the"
268,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,watch also and had an inspiration; he baited his subtle hook with a
269,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,combination fly composed partly of the gentle Elia and partly of the
270,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Rev. Canon Ainger. He knew that Butler, if he approached either of"
271,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"these authors, would do so without suspicion, because he had looked"
272,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,over his victim's shoulder one morning in the Reading Room of the
273,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,British Museum while he was making this note:
274,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
275,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"""Charles Lamb was like Mr. Darwin, 'a master of happy"
276,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"simplicity.' Sometimes, of course, he says very good things,"
277,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,at any rate some very good things have been ascribed to
278,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"him; but more commonly he is forced, faint, full of false"
279,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,sentiment and prolix. I believe that he and his sister hated
280,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"one another, as only very near relations can hate. He made"
281,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,capital out of his supposed admirable treatment of her. Aunt
282,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Sarah likes him, so do most old maids who were told what"
283,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"they ought to like about 55 yeara ago, but I never find men"
284,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"whom I think well of admire him. As for Ainger's <i>Life</i>,"
285,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"well, my sisters like it."""
286,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
287,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"We need not agree, and I personally disagree, with Butler's view of"
288,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the relations between Charles and Mary Lamb, for it seems to me that"
289,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"it is not supported by the Letters of Lamb. I do not suppose, however,"
290,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,that Butler intended his words to be taken very seriously; nor are
291,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,they intended to be taken as direct abuse of Lamb. They are addressed
292,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"rather to Lamb's admirers, and are conceived in the spirit of the"
293,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Athenian, whose reason for helping to ostracise Aristides was that he"
294,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"was so bored by hearing him perpetually called ""the Just."" They are"
295,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Butler's way of saying: ""Don't you go and suppose that I should ever"
296,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"have anything to do with self-sacrifice and devotion."" And yet his"
297,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"own life shows that he was himself capable of both; but, like many"
298,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Englishmen, he was shy of displaying emotion or of admitting that he"
299,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,experienced it. When we remember that he had not read the Letters we
300,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"can understand his being put off Lamb first by the Essays, and then by"
301,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the admirers --Aunt Sarah, the old maids, and Canon Ainger. We must"
302,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,also remember that Canon Ainger used to go and stay down at Shrewsbury
303,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"with a clergyman who, among other dissipations which he organised for"
304,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"his guest, took him to tea with Butler's sisters, where he played on"
305,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,their old piano which had been chosen by Mendelssohn. Nevertheless it
306,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"might have been better for Butler if he had not made the note, for"
307,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,retribution followed.
308,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
309,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"In June, 1886, while we were completing the words and music of our"
310,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"cantata <i>Narcissus</i>, which was published in 1888, Butler wrote to Miss"
311,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,Butler:
312,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
313,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"""The successor of <i>Narcissus</i> is to be called Ulysses; and"
314,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,is this time a serious work dealing with the wanderings of
315,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the real Ulysses, and treating the subject much as Hercules"
316,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,or Semele was treated by Handel. We think we could get some
317,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"sailor choruses, and some Circe and pig choruses, and the"
318,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"sirens, and then Penelope and her loom all afford scope."
319,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,I made up my mind about it when I read Charles Lamb's
320,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"translation of parts of the 'Odyssey' in Ainger's book, but"
321,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"please don't say anything about it."" {<i>Memoir</i>, II, 38.)"
322,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
323,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"The serpent was lurking within the leaves of Ainger's book, and"
324,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Butler was beguiled. The idea of using the story of the ""Odyssey"" for"
325,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,the words of an oratorio led him on to re-reading the poem in the
326,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,original; but he could not make much progress just then because after
327,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"his father's death, in December, 1886, he came into possession of all"
328,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"his grandfather's papers, and succumbed to the temptation of reading"
329,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,them and of writing Dr. Butler's life. When he did settle down to the
330,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"poem it fascinated him, and there followed the further irresistible"
331,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,temptation of translating it. His grandfather's life still kept him so
332,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"fully occupied that he did not reach Book ix till 1891; and then, as"
333,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"he writes in Chapter i of <i>The Authoress of the Odyssey</i>: ""It was not"
334,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,till I got to Circe that it flashed upon me that I was reading the work
335,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"not of an old man but of a young woman."" And on a letter of 9th August,"
336,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"1891, which I sent to him at Chiavenna, he made this note:"
337,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
338,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"""It was during the few days that I was at Chiavenna (at the"
339,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,Hotel Grotta Crimee) that I hit upon the female authorship
340,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,of the 'Odyssey.' I did not find out its having been written
341,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"at Trapani till 1892."""
342,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
343,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Between 1892, when he made this discovery, and 1902, when he died,"
344,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Butler published the <i>Life and Letters of Dr. Samuel Butler, Erewhon"
345,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Revisited</i>, and a new and revised edition of <i>Erewhon</i>. These three"
346,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"books were the working off of material which was already in his mind,"
347,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,but everything else published during the last decade of his life grew
348,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"directly out of the ""Odyssey."" There was a pamphlet entitled <i>The"
349,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Humour of Homer</i> (1892), which was first delivered as a lecture at the"
350,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,Working Men's College; there were two other pamphlets which appeared
351,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"in a Sicilian magazine (1893 and 1894), one of these being translated"
352,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,into English and published in 1893; there were articles about his
353,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Odyssean theories in The Italian Gazette, then under the editorship of"
354,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Miss Helen Zimmern, published in Florence. In 1897 came <i>The Authoress"
355,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"of the Odyssey</i>; in 1898, <i>The Iliad Rendered into English Prose</i>; in"
356,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"1899, <i>Shakespeare's Sonnets Reconsidered</i>; and in 1900, <i>The Odyssey"
357,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,Rendered into English Prose</i>. Besides these publications there were
358,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"letters and articles about the ""Odyssey"" in the <i>Athaeneum</i>, the"
359,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"<i>Eagle</i> and <i>Il Lambruschini</i>, a journal published at Trapani in Sicily."

361,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"The translation of the ""Iliad"" became a necessity when once that of the"
362,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"""Odyssey"" had been undertaken, and the book about the Sonnets was also"
363,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"a consequence of the ""Odyssey,"" for his interest in the problem of the"
364,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Sonnets, the work of the greatest poet of modern times, was aroused"
365,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"by his interest in the problem of the ""Odyssey,"" one of the two great"
366,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,poems of antiquity. Besides all this he was engaged upon the words and
367,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"music of <i>Ulysses</i>, in making journeys to Sicily to pick up more facts"
368,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"about the topography of Scheria, and in making a journey to Greece and"
369,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the Troad to investigate the geography of the ""Iliad."" Thus it may"
370,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,be said that the last ten years of his life were overshadowed by the
371,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"""Odyssey,"" which dominated his thoughts--and not only his thoughts,"
372,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,his letters were full of it and it was difficult to get him to talk of
373,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,anything else. I have little doubt that this perpetual preoccupation--I
374,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,may even say obsession--tended to shorten his life.
375,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
376,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,None of the eminent classical scholars paid any attention to Butler's
377,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"views on the ""Odyssey,"" or if any did they did not say so in public,"
378,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,and he resented their neglect. He was not looking for praise; as Sir
379,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"William Phipson Beale, one of his oldest friends, said to me very"
380,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"acutely: ""People misunderstood Butler; he did not want praise, he"
381,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"wanted sympathy."" It is true as he records in <i>The Authoress</i> (p. 269),"
382,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"that ""one of our most accomplished living scholars""--I do not know who"
383,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"he was, though I no doubt heard at the time--chided him and accused him"
384,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"of being ruthless. ""I confess,"" said the scholar, ""I do not give much"
385,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,heed to the details on which you lay so much stress; I read the poem
386,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"not to theorise about it but to revel in its amazing beauty."" This can"
387,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,hardly be called sympathy. Butler comments upon it thus:
388,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
389,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"""It would shock me to think that I have done anything to"
390,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,impair the sense of that beauty which I trust I share in
391,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,even measure with himself; but surely if the 'Odyssey' has
392,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"charmed us as a man's work, its charm and its wonder are"
393,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"infinitely increased when we see it as a woman's."""
394,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
395,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,Still there were some competent judges who approved. The late Lord
396,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Grimthorpe interested himself in the problem, accepted Butler's views,"
397,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,and gave him valuable suggestions about the description in the poem
398,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,of the hanging of those maidservants in Ithaca who had disgraced
399,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"themselves. Mr. Justice Wills also expressed agreement, but he did it"
400,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,in a letter to me after Butler's death. These names are mentioned in
401,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the Memoir, and there is another name which ought to have appeared"
402,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"there, but I overlooked the note at the right moment."
403,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
404,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Butler delivered at the Fabian Society a lecture entitled, ""Was the"
405,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"'Odyssey' written by a Woman?"" At the close of the lecture Mr. Bernard"
406,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,Shaw got up and said that when he had first heard of the title he
407,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"supposed it was some fad or fancy of Butler's, but that on turning"
408,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"to the ""Odyssey"" to see what could have induced him to take it up he"
409,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"had not read a hundred lines before he found himself saying: ""Why,"
410,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"of course it was!"" And he spoke so strongly that people who had only"
411,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,laughed all though the lecture began to think there might be something
412,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,in it after all.
413,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
414,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"These, however, were not the eminent Homeric scholars to whom Butler"
415,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,looked for sympathy. He was disappointed by the silence of the
416,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"orthodox, and it was here that Charles Lamb got in his revenge, for the"
417,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,situation never would have arisen if it had not been for that fatal
418,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"reading of ""Charles Lamb's translation of parts of the 'Odyssey' in"
419,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Ainger's book."""
420,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
421,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,When Keats first looked into Chapman's Homer the result was the famous
422,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"sonnet. When Lamb did the same thing the result was ""a juvenile book,"
423,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"The Adventures of Ulysses."" He wrote to Manning, 26th February, 1808:"
424,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
425,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"""It is done out of the 'Odyssey,' not from the Greek (I"
426,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"would not mislead you), nor yet from Pope's 'Odyssey,' but"
427,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,from an older translation of one Chapman. The Shakespeare
428,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Tales suggested the doing of it."""
429,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
430,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"I suppose that by ""Ainger's book"" Butler means Charles Lamb in the"
431,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"""English Men of Letters Series,"" edited by John Morley and published"
432,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,by Macmillan in 1878; at least I do not find any other book by Ainger
433,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,about Lamb which contains any mention of <i>The Adventures of Ulysses</i>
434,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,between that date and the date of Butler's letter to his sister in
435,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"1886. If I remember right Butler saw ""Ainger's book"" at Shrewsbury"
436,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"when he was staying with his sisters, and I like to think that it was"
437,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,a copy given to them by the author. But I doubt whether he can have
438,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,done more than look into it; if he had read it with attention he would
439,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,scarcely have spoken of Lamb's work as translation. I imagine that he
440,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"listlessly took the book up off the drawing-room table, and, happening"
441,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"to open it at page 68, saw that Lamb had written <i>The Adventures of"
442,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Ulysses</i>; this would be enough to suggest the story of the ""Odyssey"""
443,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"to him, and he must have missed or forgotten Ainger's statement that"
444,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Lamb said to Bernard Barton: ""Chapman is divine and my abridgement has"
445,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"not quite emptied him of his divinity."" What concerns us now, however,"
446,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"is to note the result on Butler, which was that he embarked upon all"
447,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,this apparently fruitless labour. It is interesting to note also that
448,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"as Lamb, by writing the <i>Tales from Shakespeare</i>, had been led to the"
449,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"""Odyssey,"" so Butler, by choosing Ulysses as the hero of our oratorio,"
450,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"was led, in a contrary direction, to the Sonnets."
451,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
452,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,We must now come nearer to modern times. <i>The Authoress of the Odyssey</i>
453,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"appeared in 1897, and Butler's Translation in 1900--that is about"
454,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"twenty years ago; during which period, sympathy or no sympathy, the"
455,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"books must have had a good many readers, perhaps among the general"
456,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"public rather than among classical scholars, for now, in 1921, the"
457,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,stock is exhausted and new editions of both are wanted. They have been
458,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"reset entirely, misprints and obvious mistakes have been corrected,"
459,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the index has been revised, and there are a few minor typographical"
460,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"changes; but nothing has been done which could be called editing,"
461,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"bringing up to date, adding supplementary matter, dissenting or"
462,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,recording dissent from any of the author's views. The size of the
463,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,original page has been reduced so as to make the books uniform with
464,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Butler's other works; and, fortunately, it has generally been possible,"
465,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"by using a smaller type, to get the same number of words into each"
466,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"page, so that the pagination is scarcely altered and the references"
467,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,remain good. Except for the alterations about to be noted (in respect
468,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"of <i>The Authoress</i>), the books are faithful reprints of the original"
469,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,editions.
470,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
471,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,(a) About three lines have been interpolated on page 207 which upsets
472,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the pagination until page 209. The interpolation, which is taken"
473,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"from a note by Butler in his copy of the work, is to the effect that"
474,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the authoress, in Book vii, line 137, almost calls her countrymen"
475,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,scoundrels by saying that they made their final drink-offerings not
476,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"to Jove but to Mercury, the god of thieves. On this passage there is"
477,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,a note in the Translation saying that the poet here intends hidden
478,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"malice; but, except for this interpolation, attention does not appear"
479,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,to be called to the malice anywhere else in <i>The Authoress</i>.
480,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
481,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,(b) The note on page 214 is so printed that the pagination is upset for
482,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,one page.
483,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
484,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,(c) The illustration of the coin which shows the design of the brooch
485,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"of Ulysses is now given on a separate page, whereas formerly it was in"
486,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the text, therefore the pagination is thrown out from page 227 until"
487,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the end of the chapter, page 231. Doubt has recently been cast upon"
488,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the accuracy of the statement on pp. 226-7, that this coin certainly"
489,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,belongs to the Eryx and Segesta group.
490,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
491,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,(d) Some of the headlines have been shortened because of the reduction
492,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"in the size of the page, and here advantage has been taken of various"
493,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,corrections of and additions to the headlines and shoulder-notes made
494,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,by Butler in his own copies of the two books.
495,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
496,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"(e) For the most part each of the illustrations now occupies a page,"
497,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,whereas in the original editions they generally appeared two on one
498,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,page. It has been necessary to reduce the plan of the House of Ulysses.
499,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
500,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"On page 31 this note occurs: ""Scheria means Jutland--a piece of land"
501,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"jutting out into the sea."" Butler afterwards found that Jutland means"
502,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the land of the Jutes, and has nothing to do with jutting. A note to"
503,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"this effect is in <i>The Notebooks of Samuel Butler</i>, p. 350."
504,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
505,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"On page 153 Butler says: ""No great poet would compare his hero to a"
506,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"paunch full of blood and fat cooking before the fire (xx, 24-28)."" This"
507,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"passage is not given in the abridged ""Story of the Odyssey"" at the"
508,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"beginning of the book, but in Butler's Translation it occurs in these"
509,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,words:
510,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
511,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"""Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it into"
512,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"endurance, but he tossed about as one who turns a paunch"
513,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"full of blood and fat in front of a hot fire, doing it first"
514,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"on one side then on the other, that he may get it cooked as"
515,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,soon as possible; even so did he turn himself about from
516,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"side to side, thinking all the time how, single-handed as he"
517,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"was, he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as"
518,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"the wicked suitors."""
519,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
520,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,It looks as though in the interval between the publication of <i>The
521,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,Authoress</i> (1897) and of the Translation (1900) Butler had changed his
522,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,mind; for in the first case the comparison is between Ulysses and a
523,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"paunch full, etc., and in the second it is between Ulysses and a man"
524,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"who turns a paunch full, etc. The second comparison is perhaps one"
525,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,which a great poet might make.
526,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,
527,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,In seeing the works through the press I have had the invaluable
528,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"assistance of Mr. A. T. Bartholomew of the University Library,"
529,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"Cambridge, and of Mr. Donald S. Robertson, Fellow of Trinity College,"
530,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,Cambridge. To both these friends I give my most cordial thanks for
531,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,the care and skill exercised by them. Mr. Robertson has found time
532,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,for the labour of checking and correcting all the quotations from and
533,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"references to the ""Iliad"" and ""Odyssey,"" and I believe that it could"
534,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"not have been better performed* It was, I know, a pleasure for him; and"
535,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,it would have been a pleasure also for Butler if he could have known
536,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"th£t his work was being shepherded by the son of his old friend, Mr. H."
537,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"R. Robertson, who more than a half a century ago was a fellow-student"
538,PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION,"with him at Cary's School of Art in Streatham Street, Bloomsbury."

730,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",If the questions whether the _Odyssey_ was written by a man or a
731,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","woman, and whether or no it is of exclusively Sicilian origin, were"
732,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",pregnant with no larger issues than the determination of the sex and
733,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","abode of the writer, it might be enough merely to suggest the answers"
734,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","and refer the reader to the work itself. Obviously, however, they have"
735,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",an important bearing on the whole Homeric controversy; for if we find
736,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","a woman's hand omnipresent throughout the _Odyssey_, and if we also"
737,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","find so large a number of local details, taken so exclusively and so"
738,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",faithfully from a single Sicilian town as to warrant the belief that
739,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","the writer must have lived and written there, the presumption seems"
740,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",irresistible that the poem was written by a single person. For there
741,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",can hardly have been more than one woman in the same place able to
742,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",write such--and such homogeneous--poetry as we find throughout the
743,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",_Odyssey_.
744,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
745,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Many questions will become thus simplified. Among others we can limit
746,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","the date of the poem to the lifetime of a single person, and if we"
747,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","find, as I believe we shall, that this person in all probability"
748,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","flourished, roughly between 1050 and 1000 B.C., if, moreover, we can"
749,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","show, as we assuredly can, that she had the _Iliad_ before her much as"
750,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","we have it now, quoting, consciously or unconsciously, as freely from"
751,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","the most suspected parts as from those that are admittedly Homer's, we"
752,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",shall have done much towards settling the question whether the _Iliad_
753,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",also is by one hand or by many.
754,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
755,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Not that this question ought to want much settling. The theory that
756,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ were written each of them by various hands,"
757,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","and pieced together in various centuries by various editors, is not"
758,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",one which it is easy to treat respectfully. It does not rest on the
759,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",well established case of any other poem so constructed; literature
760,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",furnishes us with no poem whose genesis is known to have been such as
761,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",that which we are asked to foist upon the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_. The
762,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",theory is founded on a supposition as to the date when writing became
763,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","possible, which has long since been shown to be untenable; not only"
764,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","does it rest on no external evidence, but it flies in the face of what"
765,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",little external evidence we have. Based on a base that has been cut
766,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","from under it, it has been sustained by arguments which have never"
767,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","succeeded in leading two scholars to the same conclusions, and which"
768,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",are of that character which will lead any one to any conclusion however
769,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","preposterous, which he may have made up his mind to consider himself as"
770,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","having established. A writer in the _Spectator_ of Jan. 2, 1892, whose"
771,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","name I do not know, concluded an article by saying,"
772,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
773,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",That the finest poem of the world was created out of the
774,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",contributions of a multitude of poets revolts all our
775,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",literary instincts.
776,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
777,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Of course it does, but the Wolfian heresy, more or less modified, is"
778,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",still so generally accepted both on the continent and in England that
779,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",it will not be easy to exterminate it.
780,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
781,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Easy or no this is a task well worth attempting, for Wolf's theory"
782,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",has been pregnant of harm in more ways than are immediately apparent.
783,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Who would have thought of attacking Shakspeare's existence--for if
784,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Shakspeare did not write his plays he is no longer Shakspeare--unless
785,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",men's minds had been unsettled by Wolf's virtual denial of Homer's?
786,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Who would have reascribed picture after picture in half the galleries
787,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","of Europe, often wantonly, and sometimes in defiance of the clearest"
788,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","evidence, if the unsettling of questions concerning authorship had not"
789,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",been found to be an easy road to reputation as a critic? Nor does there
790,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","appear to be any end to it, for each succeeding generation seems bent"
791,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",on trying to surpass the recklessness of its predecessor.
792,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
793,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","And more than this, the following pages will read a lesson of another"
794,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","kind, which I will leave the reader to guess at, to men whom I will not"
795,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","name, but some of whom he may perhaps know, for there are many of them."
796,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Indeed I have sometimes thought that the sharpness of this lesson may
797,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",be a more useful service than either the establishment of the points
798,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","which I have set myself to prove, or the dispelling of the nightmares"
799,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",of Homeric extravagance which German professors have evolved out of
800,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",their own inner consciousness.
801,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
802,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Such language may be held to come ill from one who is setting himself
803,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","to maintain two such seeming paradoxes as the feminine authorship, and"
804,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Sicilian origin, of the _Odyssey_. One such shock would be bad enough,"
805,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","but two, and each so far-reaching, are intolerable. I feel this, and am"
806,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",oppressed by it. When I look back on the record of Iliadic and Odyssean
807,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","controversy for nearly 2500 years, and reflect that it is, I may say,"
808,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",dead against me; when I reflect also upon the complexity of academic
809,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","interests, not to mention the commercial interests vested in well-known"
810,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",school books and so-called education--how can I be other than dismayed
811,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","at the magnitude, presumption, and indeed utter hopelessness, of the"
812,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",task I have undertaken?
813,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
814,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",How can I expect Homeric scholars to tolerate theories so subversive
815,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",of all that most of them have been insisting on for so many years?
816,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",It is a matter of Homeric (for my theory affects Iliadic questions
817,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",nearly as much as it does the _Odyssey_) life and death for them or
818,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",for myself. If I am right they have invested their reputation for
819,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","sagacity in a worthless stock. What becomes, for example, of a great"
820,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",part of Professor Jebb's well-known _Introduction to Homer_--to quote
821,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","his shorter title--if the _Odyssey_ was written all of it at Trapani,"
822,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","all of it by one hand, and that hand a woman's? Either my own work is"
823,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","rubbish, in which case it should not be hard to prove it so without"
824,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","using discourteous language, or not a little of theirs is not worth the"
825,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","paper on which it is written. They will be more than human, therefore,"
826,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",if they do not handle me somewhat roughly.
827,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
828,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","As for the _Odyssey_ having been written by a woman, they will tell me"
829,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",that I have not even established a _primâ facie_ case for my opinion.
830,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Of course I have not. It was Bentley who did this, when he said that"
831,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","the _Iliad_ was written for men, and the _Odyssey_ for women.[1] The"
832,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",history of literature furnishes us with no case in which a man has
833,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",written a great masterpiece for women rather than men. If an anonymous
834,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","book strikes so able a critic as having been written for women, a"
835,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",_primâ facie_ case is established for thinking that it was probably
836,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","written by a woman. I deny, however, that the _Odyssey_ was written for"
837,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",women; it was written for any one who would listen to it. What Bentley
838,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",meant was that in the _Odyssey_ things were looked at from a woman's
839,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","point of view rather than a man's, and in uttering this obvious truth,"
840,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","I repeat, he established once for all a strong _primâ facie_ case for"
841,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",thinking that it was written by a woman.
842,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
843,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",If my opponents can fasten a cavil on to the ninth part of a line of
844,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","my argument, they will take no heed of, and make no reference to,"
845,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",the eight parts on which they dared not fasten a misrepresentation
846,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",however gross. They will declare it fatal to my theory that there were
847,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",no Greek-speaking people at Trapani when the _Odyssey_ was written.
848,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Having fished up this assertion from the depths of their ignorance
849,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","of what Thucydides, let alone Virgil, has told us,--or if they set"
850,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","these writers on one side, out of their still profounder ignorance of"
851,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",what there was or was not at Trapani in the eleventh century before
852,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Christ--they will refuse to look at the internal evidence furnished
853,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",by the _Odyssey_ itself. They will ignore the fact that Thucydides
854,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","tells us that ""Phocians of those from Troy,"" which as I will show"
855,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","(see Chapter XII.) can only mean Phocæans, settled at Mount Eryx, and"
856,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",ask me how I can place Phocæans on Mount Eryx when Thucydides says it
857,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",was Phocians who settled there? They will ignore the fact that even
858,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","though Thucydides had said ""Phocians"" without qualifying his words by"
859,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","adding ""of those from Troy,"" or ""of the Trojan branch,"" he still places"
860,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Greek-speaking people within five miles of Trapani.
861,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
862,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","As for the points of correspondence between both Ithaca and Scheria,"
863,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","and Trapani, they will remind me that Captain Fluelen found"
864,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","resemblances between Monmouth and Macedon, as also Bernardino Caimi"
865,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",did between Jerusalem and Varallo-Sesia; they will say that if mere
866,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","topographical resemblances are to be considered, the Channel Islands"
867,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",are far more like the Ionian group as described in the _Odyssey_ than
868,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","those off Trapani are, while Balaclava presents us with the whole"
869,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Scherian combination so far more plausibly than Trapani as to leave no
870,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",doubt which site should be preferred. I have not looked at the map of
871,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Balaclava to see whether this is so or no, nor yet at other equally"
872,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","promising sites which have been offered me, but am limiting myself to"
873,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",giving examples of criticisms which have been repeatedly passed upon
874,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","my theory during the last six years, and which I do not doubt will be"
875,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",repeatedly passed upon it in the future.
876,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
877,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",On the other hand I may comfort myself by reflecting that however
878,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",much I may deserve stoning there is no one who can stone me with a
879,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","clear conscience. Those who hold, as most people now do, that the"
880,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",_Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ belong to ages separated from one another by
881,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","some generations, must be haunted by the reflection that though the"
882,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",diversity of authorship was prominently insisted on by many people more
883,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","than two thousand years ago, not a single Homeric student from those"
884,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",days to the end of the last century could be brought to acknowledge
885,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","what we now deem self-evident. Professor Jebb, writing of Bentley,[2]"
886,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",says
887,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
888,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","He had not felt what is now so generally admitted, that"
889,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",the _Odyssey_ bears the marks of a later time than the
890,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",_Iliad_.
891,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
892,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",How came so great a man as Bentley not to see what is so obvious?
893,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Truly, as has been said by Mr. Gladstone, if Homer is old, the"
894,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",systematic and comprehensive study of him is still young.[3]
895,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
896,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",I shall not argue the question whether the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ are
897,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","by the same person, inasmuch as if I convince the reader that the"
898,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","_Odyssey_ was written by a woman and in Sicily, it will go without"
899,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",saying that it was not written by Homer; for there can be no doubt
900,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",about the sex of the writer of the _Iliad_. The same canons which
901,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",will compel us to ascribe the _Odyssey_ to a woman forbid any other
902,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",conclusion than that the _Iliad_ was written by a man. I shall
903,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",therefore proceed at once to the question whether the _Odyssey_ was
904,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",written by a man or by a woman.
905,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
906,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",It is an old saying that no man can do better for another than he can
907,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","for himself, I may perhaps therefore best succeed in convincing the"
908,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",reader if I retrace the steps by which I arrived at the conclusions I
909,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",ask him to adopt.
910,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
911,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",I was led to take up the _Odyssey_ by having written the libretto and
912,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","much of the music for a secular oratorio, _Ulysses_, on which my friend"
913,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Mr. H. Festing Jones and I had been for some time engaged. Having
914,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",reached this point it occurred to me that I had better after all see
915,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","what the _Odyssey_ said, and finding no readable prose translation, was"
916,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","driven to the original, to which I had not given so much as a thought"
917,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",for some five and thirty years.
918,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
919,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","The Greek being easy, I had little difficulty in understanding what I"
920,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","read, and I had the great advantage of coming to the poem with fresh"
921,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","eyes. Also, I read it all through from end to end, as I have since many"
922,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",times done.
923,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
924,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Fascinated, however, as I at once was by its amazing interest and"
925,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","beauty, I had an ever-present sense of a something wrong, of a"
926,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","something that was eluding me, and of a riddle which I could not read."
927,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","The more I reflected upon the words, so luminous and so transparent,"
928,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","the more I felt a darkness behind them, that I must pierce before I"
929,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",could see the heart of the writer--and this was what I wanted; for art
930,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",is only interesting in so far as it reveals an artist.
931,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
932,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",In the hope of getting to understand the poem better I set about
933,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","translating it into plain prose, with the same benevolent leaning, say,"
934,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","towards Tottenham Court Road, that Messrs. Butcher and Lang have shewn"
935,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","towards Wardour Street. I admit, however, that Wardour Street English"
936,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","has something to say for itself. The ""Ancient Mariner,"" for example,"
937,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","would have lost a good deal if it had been called ""The Old Sailor,"" but"
938,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",on the whole I take it that a tale so absolutely without any taint of
939,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",affectation as the _Odyssey_ will speed best being unaffectedly told.
940,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
941,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",When I came to the Phæacian episode I felt sure that here at any rate
942,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","the writer was drawing from life, and that Nausicaa, Queen Arete, and"
943,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Alcinous were real people more or less travestied, and on turning"
944,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",to Colonel Mure's work[4] I saw that he was of the same opinion.
945,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Nevertheless I found myself continually aghast at the manner in which
946,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","men were made to speak and act--especially, for example, during the"
947,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",games in honour of _Ulysses_ described in Book viii. Colonel Mure says
948,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","(p. 407) that ""the women engross the chief part of the small stock"
949,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","of common sense allotted to the community."" So they do, but it never"
950,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",occurred to me to ask myself whether men commonly write brilliant
951,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",books in which the women are made more sensible than the men. Still
952,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","dominated by the idea that the writer was a man, I conjectured that he"
953,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","might be some bard, perhaps blind, who lived among the servants much"
954,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",as the chaplain in a great house a couple of hundred years ago among
955,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","ourselves. Such a bard, even though not blind, would only see great"
956,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","people from a distance, and would not mix with them intimately enough"
957,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",to know how they would speak and act among themselves. It never even
958,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",crossed my mind that it might have been the commentators who were
959,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","blind, and that they might have thus come to think that the poet must"
960,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",have been blind too.
961,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
962,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",The view that the writer might have lived more in the steward's room
963,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",than with the great people of the house served (I say it with shame) to
964,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","quiet me for a time, but by and by it struck me that though the men"
965,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","often both said and did things that no man would say or do, the women"
966,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",were always ladies when the writer chose to make them so. How could it
967,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",be that a servant's hall bard should so often go hopelessly wrong with
968,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","his men, and yet be so exquisitively right with every single one of his"
969,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",women? But still I did not catch it. It was not till I got to Circe
970,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","that it flashed upon me that I was reading the work, not of an old man,"
971,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",but of a young woman--and of one who knew not much more about what men
972,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",can and cannot do than I had found her know about the milking of ewes
973,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",in the cave of Polyphemus.
974,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
975,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","The more I think of it the more I wonder at my own stupidity, for I"
976,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",remember that when I was a boy at school I used to say the _Odyssey_
977,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","was the _Iliad's_ wife, and that it was written by a clergyman."
978,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","But however this may be, as soon as the idea that the writer was a"
979,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","woman--and a young one--presented itself to me, I felt that here was"
980,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",the reading of the riddle that had so long baffled me. I tried to
981,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","divest myself of it, but it would not go; as long as I kept to it,"
982,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","everything cohered and was in its right place, and when I set it aside"
983,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",all was wrong again; I did not seek my conclusion; I did not even know
984,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","it by sight so as to look for it; it accosted me, introduced itself as"
985,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","my conclusion, and vowed that it would never leave me; whereon, being"
986,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","struck with its appearance, I let it stay with me on probation for a"
987,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",week or two during which I was charmed with the propriety of all it
988,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","said or did, and then bade it take rank with the convictions to which I"
989,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",was most firmly wedded; but I need hardly say that it was a long time
990,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","before I came to see that the poem was all of it written at Trapani,"
991,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",and that the writer had introduced herself into her work under the name
992,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",of Nausicaa.
993,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
994,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","I will deal with these points later, but would point out that the"
995,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",moment we refuse to attribute the _Odyssey_ to the writer of the
996,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",_Iliad_ (whom we should alone call Homer) it becomes an anonymous
997,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",work; and the first thing that a critic will set himself to do when
998,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",he considers an anonymous work is to determine the sex of the writer.
999,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","This, even when women are posing as men, is seldom difficult--indeed"
1000,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",it is done almost invariably with success as often as an anonymous
1001,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",work is published--and when any one writes with the frankness and
1002,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","spontaneity which are such an irresistible charm in the _Odyssey_, it"
1003,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",is not only not difficult but exceedingly easy; difficulty will only
1004,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","arise, if the critic is, as we have all been in this case, dominated by"
1005,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","a deeply-rooted preconceived opinion, and if also there is some strong"
1006,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",_à priori_ improbability in the supposition that the writer was a woman.
1007,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
1008,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",It may be urged that it is extremely improbable that any woman in
1009,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",any age should write such a masterpiece as the _Odyssey_. But so
1010,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",it also is that any man should do so. In all the many hundreds of
1011,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","years since the _Odyssey_ was written, no man has been able to write"
1012,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",another that will compare with it. It was extremely improbable that
1013,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","the son of a Stratford wool-stapler should write _Hamlet_, or that a"
1014,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Bedfordshire tinker should produce such a masterpiece as _Pilgrim s
1015,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Progress_. Phenomenal works imply a phenomenal workman, but there are"
1016,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","phenomenal women as well as phenomenal men, and though there is much"
1017,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","in the _Iliad_ which no woman, however phenomenal, can be supposed"
1018,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","at all likely to have written, there is not a line in the _Odyssey_"
1019,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","which a woman might not perfectly well write, and there is much beauty"
1020,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",which a man would be almost certain to neglect. Moreover there are
1021,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","many mistakes in the _Odyssey_ which a young woman might easily make,"
1022,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","but which a man could hardly fall into--for example, making the wind"
1023,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","whistle over waves at the end of Book ii., thinking that a lamb could"
1024,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","live on two pulls a day at a ewe that was already milked (ix. 244, 245,"
1025,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","and 308, 309), believing a ship to have a rudder at both ends (ix. 483,"
1026,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","540), thinking that dry and well-seasoned timber can be cut from a"
1027,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","growing tree (v. 240), making a hawk while still on the wing tear its"
1028,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",prey--a thing that no hawk can do (xv. 527).
1029,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
1030,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",I see that Messrs. Butcher and Lang omit ix. 483 in which the rudder
1031,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","is placed in the bows of a ship, but it is found in the text, and is"
1032,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",the last kind of statement a copyist would be inclined to intercalate.
1033,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Yet I could have found it in my heart to conceive the text in fault,"
1034,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",had I not also found the writer explaining in Book v. 255 that Ulysses
1035,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","gave his raft a rudder ""in order that he might be able to steer it."""
1036,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",People whose ideas about rudders have become well defined will let the
1037,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",fact that a ship is steered by means of its rudder go without saying.
1038,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Furthermore, not only does she explain that Ulysses would want a rudder"
1039,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","to steer with, but later on (line 270) she tells us that he actually"
1040,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","did use the rudder when he had made it, and, moreover, that he used it"
1041,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","τεχνηέντως, or skilfully."
1042,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
1043,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Young women know that a horse goes before a cart, and being told that"
1044,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","the rudder guides the ship, are apt--and I have more than once found"
1045,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",them do so--to believe that it goes in front of the ship. Probably the
1046,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",writer of the _Odyssey_ forgot for the moment at which end the rudder
1047,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","should be. She thought it all over yesterday, and was not going to"
1048,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","think it all over again to-day, so she put the rudder at both ends,"
1049,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",intending to remove it from the one that should prove to be the wrong
1050,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","one; later on she forgot, or did not think it worth while to trouble"
1051,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",about so small a detail.
1052,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
1053,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",So with Calypso's axe (v. 234-36). No one who was used to handling an
1054,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","axe would describe it so fully and tell us that it ""suited Ulysses'"
1055,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","hands,"" and was furnished with a handle. I have heard say that a"
1056,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",celebrated female authoress was discovered to be a woman by her
1057,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","having spoken of a two-foot _ruler_ instead of a two-foot _rule_, but"
1058,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",over minuteness of description is deeper and stronger evidence of
1059,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",unfamiliarity than mistaken nomenclature is.
1060,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
1061,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Such mistakes and self-betrayals as those above pointed out enhance
1062,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",rather than impair the charm of the _Odyssey_. Granted that the
1063,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","_Odyssey_ is inferior to the _Iliad_ in strength, robustness, and"
1064,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","wealth of poetic imagery, I cannot think that it is inferior in its"
1065,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","power of fascinating the reader. Indeed, if I had to sacrifice one or"
1066,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","the other, I can hardly doubt that I should let the _Iliad_ go rather"
1067,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",than the _Odyssey_--just as if I had to sacrifice either Mont Blanc or
1068,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Monte Rosa, I should sacrifice Mont Blanc, though I know it to be in"
1069,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",many respects the grander mountain of the two.[5]
1070,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
1071,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","It should go, however, without saying that much which is charming in"
1072,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","a woman's work would be ridiculous in a man's, and this is eminently"
1073,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","exemplified in the _Odyssey_. If a woman wrote it, it is as lovely as"
1074,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","the frontispiece of this volume, and becomes, if less vigorous, yet"
1075,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","assuredly more wonderful than the _Iliad_; if, on the other hand, it"
1076,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","is by a man, the half Bayeux tapestry, half Botticelli's Venus rising"
1077,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","from the sea, or Primavera, feeling with which it impresses us gives"
1078,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",place to astonishment how any man could have written it. What is a
1079,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","right manner for a woman is a wrong one for a man, and _vice versa_."
1080,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Jane Austen's young men, for example, are seldom very interesting, but"
1081,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",it is only those who are blind to the exquisite truth and delicacy of
1082,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Jane Austen's work who will feel any wish to complain of her for not
1083,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",understanding young men as well as she did young women.
1084,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
1085,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","The writer of a _Times_ leading article (Feb. 4th, 1897) says:"
1086,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",

1098,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","obstacle to our thinking that such a woman may have existed, say, B.C."
1099,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",1000? I know of none. Greek literature does not begin to dawn upon us
1100,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",till about 600 B.C. Earlier than this date we have hardly anything
1101,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","except the _Iliad_, _Odyssey_, and that charming writer Hesiod. When,"
1102,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","however, we come to the earliest historic literature we find that"
1103,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",famous poetesses abounded.

1105,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Those who turn to the article ""Sappho"" in Smith's _Dictionary of"
1106,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",Classical Biography_ will find Gorgo and Andromeda mentioned as her

1108,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Colophon, Eunica of Salamis, Gyrinna, Atthis, and Mnasidica, ""Those,"""
1109,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","says the writer, ""who attained the highest celebrity for their works"

1111,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","poetess wrote a long poem upon the distaff, which was considered equal"
1112,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",to Homer himself--the _Odyssey_ being probably intended.
1113,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
1114,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Again, there was Baucis, who wrote Erinna's Epitaph. Turning to"
1115,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Müller's work upon the Dorians, I find reference made to the amatory"
1116,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","poetesses of Lesbos. He tells us also of Corinna, who is said to have"
1117,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","competed successfully with Pindar, and Myrto, who certainly competed"
1118,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","with him, but with what success we know not. Again, there was Diotima"
1119,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",the Arcadian; and looking through Bergk's _Poetœ Lyrici Grœci_ I find
1120,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","other names of women, fragments of whose works have readied us through"
1121,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","quotation by extant writers. Among the Hebrews there were Miriam,"
1122,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Deborah, and Hannah, all of them believed to be centuries older than"

1125,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","If, then, poetesses were as abundant as we know them to have been in"

1127,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","Asia Minor, and the islands of the Ægæan, there is no ground for"
1128,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",refusing to admit the possibility that a Greek poetess lived in Sicily
1129,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","B.C. 1000, especially when we know from Thucydides that the particular"
1130,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",part of Sicily where I suppose her to have lived was colonised from
1131,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",the North West corner of Asia Minor centuries before the close of
1132,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",the Homeric age. The civilisation depicted in the _Odyssey_ is as
1133,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",advanced as any that is likely to have existed in Mitylene or Melos
1134,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","600--500 B.C., while in both the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ the status"
1135,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","of women is represented as being much what it is at the present, and as"
1136,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",incomparably higher than it was in the Athenian civilisation with which
1137,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",we are best acquainted. To imagine a great Greek poetess at Athens in
1138,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","the age of Pericles would be to violate probability, but I might almost"
1139,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",say in an age when women were as free as they are represented to us in
1140,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",the _Odyssey_ it is a violation of probability to suppose that there
1141,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",were no poetesses.
1142,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",
1143,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",We have no reason to think that men found the use of their tongue
1144,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",sooner than women did; why then should we suppose that women lagged
1145,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",behind men when the use of the pen had become familiar? If a woman
1146,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","could work pictures with her needle as Helen did,[6] and as the wife of"
1147,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","William the Conqueror did in a very similiar civilisation, she could"
1148,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",write stories with her pen if she had a mind to do so.

1150,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",The fact that the recognised heads of literature in the Homeric age
1151,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","were the nine Muses--for it is always these or ""The Muse"" that is"
1152,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","involved, and never Apollo or Minerva--throws back the suggestion"
1153,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","of female authorship to a very remote period, when, to be an author"
1154,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","at all, was to be a poet, for prose writing is a comparatively late"
1155,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",development. Both _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ begin with an invocation
1156,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","addressed to a woman, who, as the head of literature, must be supposed"
1157,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","to have been an authoress, though none of her works have come down to"
1158,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","us. In an age, moreover, when men were chiefly occupied either with"
1159,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","fighting or hunting, the arts of peace, and among them all kinds of"
1160,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","literary accomplishment, would be more naturally left to women. If the"
1161,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.","truth were known, we might very likely find that it was man rather than"
1162,"THAN WOMAN, THE INTERLOPER.",woman who has been the interloper in the domain of literature. Nausicaa

1195,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"in the hands of the writer, if I lay before him an abridgement of"

1197,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"space permitted I should print my translation in full, but this is"
1198,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"obviously impossible, for what I give here is only about a fourth"
1199,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"of the whole poem. I have, therefore, selected those parts that"

1201,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,much connecting matter as may serve to make the whole readable and
1202,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,intelligible. I am aware that the beauty of the poem is thus fatally
1203,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"marred, for it is often the loveliest passages that serve my purpose"
1204,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"least. The abridgement, therefore, that I here give is not to be"
1205,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,regarded otherwise than as the key-sketch which we so often see under
1206,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,an engraving of a picture that contains many portraits. It is intended
1207,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"not as a work of art, but as an elucidatory diagram."
1208,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
1209,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"As regards its closeness to the text, the references to the poem which"
1210,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,will be found at the beginning of each paragraph will show where the

1212,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,verify the fidelity of the rendering either with the Greek or with
1213,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,Messrs. Butcher and Lang's translation. I affirm with confidence that
1214,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,if the reader is good enough to thus verify any passages that may
1215,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"strike him as impossibly modern, he will find that I have adhered as"
1216,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,severely to the intention of the original as it was possible for me to
1217,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,do while telling the story in my own words and abridging it.

1219,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"One of my critics, a very friendly one, has told me that I have"

1224,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,down aught in malice. Where the writer is trying to make us believe
1225,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"impossibilities, I have shown that she is doing so, and have also"
1226,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,shown why she wanted us to believe them; but until a single passage
1227,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,is pointed out to me in which I have altered the intention of the
1228,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"original, I shall continue to hold that the conception of the poem"
1229,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,which I lay before the reader in the following pages is a juster one
1230,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"than any that, so far as I know, has been made public hitherto; and,"
1231,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"moreover, that it makes both the work and the writer a hundred times"

1246,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"I hold to have been open to the sky, except the covered cloister or"

1252,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,These are details: substantially my view of the action and scene during

1263,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,their time.
1264,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,
1265,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"It also contained the store-room, which seems to have been placed at"
1266,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"the far end of the house, perhaps in a basement. The store-room could"
1267,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"be reached by a passage from a doorway _A'_, and also by back-passages"
1268,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"from a side-entrance _A""_, which I suppose to have been the back door"
1269,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,of the house. The women's apartments opened on to the passage leading

1274,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,bearing-posts with cross-beams and rafters. The open part of the court
1275,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,had no flooring but the natural soil. Animals seem to have been flayed

1281,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,distinguish it from that which was open to the sun. The end nearest the
1282,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,"house was paved with stone, while that nearest the outer court (and"
1283,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,probably the other two sides) were floored with ash. The part of the
1284,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,cloister that was paved with stone does not appear to have been raised
1285,THE STORY OF THE ODYSSEY.,above the level of the rest; at one end of the stone pavement there was

1381,BOOK I.,
1382,BOOK I.,Now it so fell out that Neptune had gone to pay a visit        21
1383,BOOK I.,"to the Ethiopians, who lie in two halves, one half"

1401,BOOK I.,the suitors playing draughts in front of the house
1402,BOOK I.,"and lording it in great style. Telemachus, seeing her"

1404,BOOK I.,placed her spear in the spear-stand against a strong
1405,BOOK I.,"bearing-post, brought her a seat, and set refreshments"

1411,BOOK I.,"eating they compelled Phemius, a famous bard, to sing"
1412,BOOK I.,to them. On this Telemachus began talking quietly to
1413,BOOK I.,Minerva: he told her how his father's return seemed now

1450,BOOK I.,
1451,BOOK I.,Phemius was still singing: he had chosen for his subject      325

1454,BOOK I.,the presence of the suitors holding a veil before her
1455,BOOK I.,"face, and waited upon by two of her handmaids, one of"
1456,BOOK I.,whom stood on either side of her. She stood by one of the
1457,BOOK I.,"bearing-posts that supported the roof of the cloisters,"
1458,BOOK I.,"and bade Phemius change his theme, which she found too"
1459,BOOK I.,painful as reminding her of her lost husband.
1460,BOOK I.,
1461,BOOK I.,"Telemachus reasoned with her, and ended by desiring her       345"
1462,BOOK I.,"to go upstairs again. ""Go back,"" he said, ""within the"

1482,BOOK I.,Euryclea had been bought by Laertes when she was quite        430

1485,BOOK I.,"but he did not take her to his bed, for he respected his"
1486,BOOK I.,wife's displeasure. The good old woman showed Telemachus
1487,BOOK I.,"to his room, and waited while he undressed. She took his"
1488,BOOK I.,"shirt from him, folded it carefully up, and hung it on a"

1517,BOOK II.,them. He explained how for nearly four years she had
1518,BOOK II.,"tricked them about the web, which she said was to be a"
1519,BOOK II.,"pall for Laertes. ""The answer, therefore,"" said he, ""that"

1527,BOOK II.,refund to his grandfather Icarius the dowry that Ulysses
1528,BOOK II.,"had received on marrying Penelope, and this would bear"
1529,BOOK II.,hardly on him. Besides it would not be a creditable thing
1530,BOOK II.,to do.
1531,BOOK II.,
1532,BOOK II.,On this Jove sent two eagles from the top of a                146
1533,BOOK II.,"mountain,[6] who flew and flew in their own lordly flight"
1534,BOOK II.,"till they reached the assembly, over which they screamed"
1535,BOOK II.,"and fought, glaring death into the faces of those who"
1536,BOOK II.,"were below. The people wondered what it might all mean,"
1537,BOOK II.,till the old Soothsayer Halitherses told them that it
1538,BOOK II.,foreshadowed the immediate return of Ulysses to take his
1539,BOOK II.,revenge upon the suitors.

1541,BOOK II.,"Eurymachus made him an angry answer. ""As long,"" he            177"

1545,BOOK II.,
1546,BOOK II.,Telemachus replied that there was nothing more to be          208

1550,BOOK II.,
1551,BOOK II.,Mentor now upbraided his countrymen for standing idly         224
1552,BOOK II.,by when they could easily coerce the suitors into good

1554,BOOK II.,the meeting dispersed. The suitors then returned to the
1555,BOOK II.,house of Ulysses.
1556,BOOK II.,
1557,BOOK II.,But Telemachus went away all alone by the sea side to         260
1558,BOOK II.,"pray. He washed his hands in the grey waves, and implored"
1559,BOOK II.,Minerva to assist him; whereon the goddess came up to
1560,BOOK II.,him in the form of Mentor. She discoursed to him about
1561,BOOK II.,"his conduct generally, and wound up by saying that she"
1562,BOOK II.,"would not only find him a ship, but would come with"
1563,BOOK II.,him herself. He was therefore to go home and get the
1564,BOOK II.,necessary provisions ready.

1566,BOOK II.,"He did as she directed him and went home, where, after        296"

1568,BOOK II.,"published his intention of going on his voyage, he went"
1569,BOOK II.,down into the store room and told Euryclea to get the
1570,BOOK II.,provisions ready; at the same time he made her take a
1571,BOOK II.,"solemn oath of secrecy for ten or twelve days, so as not"
1572,BOOK II.,"to alarm Penelope. Meanwhile Minerva, still disguised as"
1573,BOOK II.,"Mentor, borrowed a ship from a neighbour. Noëmon, and at"
1574,BOOK II.,"nightfall, after the suitors had left as usual, she and"

1598,BOOK III.,"When he heard this, Nestor told him all about his own         102"
1599,BOOK III.,"adventures on his way home from Troy, but could give him"
1600,BOOK III.,"no news of Ulysses. He touched, however, on the murder"
1601,BOOK III.,"of Agamemnon by Ægisthus, and the revenge taken by"
1602,BOOK III.,Orestes.[8]
1603,BOOK III.,
1604,BOOK III.,Telemachus said he wished he might be able to take a like     201
1605,BOOK III.,"revenge on the suitors of his mother, who were ruining"
1606,BOOK III.,"him; ""but this,"" he exclaimed, ""could not happen, not"
1607,BOOK III.,even if the gods wished it. It is too much even to think
1608,BOOK III.,"of."""
1609,BOOK III.,
1610,BOOK III.,"Minerva reproved him sharply. ""The hand of heaven,"" she       229"
1611,BOOK III.,"said, ""can reach far when it has a mind to save a man."""
1612,BOOK III.,"Telemachus then changed the conversation, and asked"
1613,BOOK III.,"Nestor how Ægisthus managed to kill Agamemnon, who was so"
1614,BOOK III.,much the better man of the two. What was Menelaus doing?
1615,BOOK III.,
1616,BOOK III.,"""Menelaus,"" answered Nestor, ""had not yet returned            253"
1617,BOOK III.,"from his long wanderings. As for Clytemnestra, she was        266"
1618,BOOK III.,"naturally of a good disposition, but was beguiled by"
1619,BOOK III.,"Ægisthus, who reigned seven years in Mycene after he had"
1620,BOOK III.,"killed Agamemnon. In the eighth year, however, Orestes"
1621,BOOK III.,"came from Athens and killed him, and on the very day when     311"
1622,BOOK III.,Orestes was celebrating the funeral feast of Ægisthus and
1623,BOOK III.,"Clytemnestra, Menelaus returned. Go then to Sparta, and"
1624,BOOK III.,"see if he can tell you anything."""
1625,BOOK III.,
1626,BOOK III.,"By this time the sun had set, and Minerva proposed            329"
1627,BOOK III.,"that she and Telemachus should return to their ship,"
1628,BOOK III.,but Nestor would not hear of their doing so. Minerva
1629,BOOK III.,"therefore consented that Telemachus should stay on shore,"
1630,BOOK III.,and explained that she could not remain with him inasmuch
1631,BOOK III.,as she must start on the following morning for the
1632,BOOK III.,"Cauconians, to recover a large debt that had been long"
1633,BOOK III.,owing to her.
1634,BOOK III.,
1635,BOOK III.,"Having said this, to the astonishment of all present she      371"
1636,BOOK III.,flew away in the form of an eagle. Whereon Nestor grasped
1637,BOOK III.,Telemachus's hand and said he could see that he must be a
1638,BOOK III.,very important person. He also at once vowed to gild the
1639,BOOK III.,horns of a heifer and sacrifice her to the goddess. He
1640,BOOK III.,then took Telemachus home with him and lodged him in his
1641,BOOK III.,own house.
1642,BOOK III.,
1643,BOOK III.,Next day Nestor fulfilled his vow; the heifer was brought     404
1644,BOOK III.,"in from the plains, her horns were gilded, and Nestor's"
1645,BOOK III.,wife Eurydice and her daughters shouted with delight at
1646,BOOK III.,seeing her killed.
1647,BOOK III.,
1648,BOOK III.,After the banquet that ensued Nestor sent Telemachus          477
1649,BOOK III.,and his son Pisistratus off in a chariot and pair for
1650,BOOK III.,"Lacedæmon, which they reached on the following morning,"

1668,BOOK IV.,Menelaus (after a little demur on the part of his _major     22
1669,BOOK IV.,"domo_ Eteoneus, for which he was severely reprimanded by"
1670,BOOK IV.,"his master) entertained his guests very hospitably, and"
1671,BOOK IV.,overhearing Telemachus call his friend's attention to the
1672,BOOK IV.,"splendour of the house, he explained to them how much"
1673,BOOK IV.,"toil and sorrow he had endured, especially through the"
1674,BOOK IV.,"murder of his brother Agamemnon, the plundering of his"
1675,BOOK IV.,"house by Paris when he carried off Helen, and the death"
1676,BOOK IV.,"of so many of his brave comrades at Troy. ""There is one"
1677,BOOK IV.,"man, however,"" he added, ""of whom I cannot even think"
1678,BOOK IV.,"without loathing both food and sleep. I mean Ulysses."""
1679,BOOK IV.,
1680,BOOK IV.,When Telemachus heard his father thus mentioned he could      112
1681,BOOK IV.,"not restrain his tears, and while Menelaus was in doubt"
1682,BOOK IV.,"what to say or not say, Helen came down (dinner being now"
1683,BOOK IV.,"half through) with her three attendant maidens, Adraste,"
1684,BOOK IV.,"Alcippe, and Phylo, who set a seat for her and brought"

1691,BOOK IV.,I think. I never saw such a likeness--neither in man
1692,BOOK IV.,"nor woman. This young man can only be Telemachus, whom"

1694,BOOK IV.,"for Troy."""
1695,BOOK IV.,
1696,BOOK IV.,"""I too,"" answered Menelaus, ""have observed the likeness.      147"

1698,BOOK IV.,
1699,BOOK IV.,"On this Pisistratus explained that they were quite right,     155"
1700,BOOK IV.,whereon Menelaus told him all he had meant doing for
1701,BOOK IV.,"Ulysses, and this was so affecting that all the four who"
1702,BOOK IV.,were at table burst into tears. After a little while
1703,BOOK IV.,Pisistratus complimented Menelaus on his great sagacity
1704,BOOK IV.,"(of which indeed his father Nestor had often told him),"
1705,BOOK IV.,and said that he did not like weeping when he was getting
1706,BOOK IV.,his dinner; he therefore proposed that the remainder of
1707,BOOK IV.,their lamentation should be deferred until next morning.
1708,BOOK IV.,"Menelaus assented to this, and dinner was allowed to          220"
1709,BOOK IV.,"proceed. Helen mixed some Nepenthe with the wine, and"
1710,BOOK IV.,cheerfulness was thus restored.
1711,BOOK IV.,
1712,BOOK IV.,Helen then told how she had met Ulysses when he entered       235
1713,BOOK IV.,"Troy as a spy, and explained that by that time she"
1714,BOOK IV.,"was already anxious to return home, and was lamenting"
1715,BOOK IV.,the cruel calamity which Venus had inflicted on her           261
1716,BOOK IV.,in separating her from her little girl and from her
1717,BOOK IV.,"husband, who was really not deficient either in person or"
1718,BOOK IV.,understanding.
1719,BOOK IV.,
1720,BOOK IV.,Menelaus capped her story with an account of the              265
1721,BOOK IV.,"adventures of the Achæans inside the wooden horse. ""Do"
1722,BOOK IV.,"you not remember,"" said he, ""how you walked all round it"
1723,BOOK IV.,"when we were inside, and patted it? You had Deiphobus"
1724,BOOK IV.,"with you, and you kept on calling out our names and           279"
1725,BOOK IV.,"mimicking our wives, till Minerva came and took you away."
1726,BOOK IV.,"It was Ulysses' presence of mind that then saved us."""
1727,BOOK IV.,
1728,BOOK IV.,"When he had told this, Telemachus said it was time to go      290"
1729,BOOK IV.,"to rest, so he and Pisistratus were shown to their room"
1730,BOOK IV.,"in the vestibule, while Menelaus and Helen retired to the"
1731,BOOK IV.,interior of the house.[10]
1732,BOOK IV.,
1733,BOOK IV.,When morning came Telemachus told Menelaus about the          306
1734,BOOK IV.,"suitors, and asked for any information he could give him"
1735,BOOK IV.,concerning the death of his father. Menelaus was greatly
1736,BOOK IV.,"shocked, but could only tell him what he had heard from"
1737,BOOK IV.,Proteus. He said that as he was coming from Egypt he had
1738,BOOK IV.,"been detained some weeks through, the displeasure of the"
1739,BOOK IV.,"gods, in the island of Pharos, where he and his men would"
1740,BOOK IV.,have been starved but for the assistance given him by a
1741,BOOK IV.,"goddess Idothea, daughter to Proteus, who taught him how"
1742,BOOK IV.,"to ensnare her father, and compel him to say why heaven"
1743,BOOK IV.,was detaining him.
1744,BOOK IV.,
1745,BOOK IV.,"""Idothea,"" said Menelaus, ""disguised me and my three          410"
1746,BOOK IV.,chosen comrades as seals; to this end she had brought
1747,BOOK IV.,"four fresh-flayed seal-skins, under which she hid us."
1748,BOOK IV.,The strong smell of these skins was most distressing to
1749,BOOK IV.,us--Who would go to bed with a sea monster if he could
1750,BOOK IV.,help it? but Idothea put some ambrosia under each man's       443
1751,BOOK IV.,"nostrils, and this afforded us great relief. Other seals"
1752,BOOK IV.,(Halsoydne's chickens as they call them) now kept coming
1753,BOOK IV.,"up by hundreds, and lay down to bask upon the beach."
1754,BOOK IV.,
1755,BOOK IV.,"""Towards noon Proteus himself came up. First he counted       450"
1756,BOOK IV.,"all his seals to see that he had the right number, and he"
1757,BOOK IV.,counted us in with the others; when he had so done he lay
1758,BOOK IV.,"down in the midst of them, as a shepherd with his sheep,"
1759,BOOK IV.,and as soon as he was asleep we pounced upon him and
1760,BOOK IV.,"gripped him tight; at one moment he became a lion, the"
1761,BOOK IV.,"next he was running water, and then again he was a tree;"
1762,BOOK IV.,"but we never loosed hold, and in the end he grew weary,"
1763,BOOK IV.,and told us what we would know.
1764,BOOK IV.,
1765,BOOK IV.,"""He told me also of the fate of Ajax, son of Oïleus, and      499"
1766,BOOK IV.,"of my brother Agamemnon. Lastly he told me about Ulysses,"
1767,BOOK IV.,"who he said was in the island of the nymph Calypso,"
1768,BOOK IV.,unable to get away inasmuch as he had neither ship nor
1769,BOOK IV.,crew.
1770,BOOK IV.,
1771,BOOK IV.,"""Then he disappeared under the sea, and I, after              570"
1772,BOOK IV.,"appeasing heaven's anger as he had instructed me,"
1773,BOOK IV.,"returned quickly and safely to my own country."""
1774,BOOK IV.,
1775,BOOK IV.,Having finished his story Menelaus pressed Telemachus         587
1776,BOOK IV.,"to remain with him some ten or twelve days longer, and"
1777,BOOK IV.,promised to give him a chariot and a pair of horses
1778,BOOK IV.,"as a keepsake, but Telemachus said that he could not"
1779,BOOK IV.,"stay. ""I could listen to you,"" said he, ""for a whole"
1780,BOOK IV.,"twelve months, and never once think about my home and"
1781,BOOK IV.,"my parents; but my men, whom I have left at Pylos, are"
1782,BOOK IV.,already impatient for me to return. As for any present
1783,BOOK IV.,"you may make me, let it be a piece of plate. I cannot"
1784,BOOK IV.,take horses to Ithaca; it contains no plains nor meadow
1785,BOOK IV.,"lands, and is more fit for breeding goats than horses."
1786,BOOK IV.,"None of our islands are suited for chariot races, and"
1787,BOOK IV.,"Ithaca least among them all."""
1788,BOOK IV.,
1789,BOOK IV.,"Menelaus smiled, and said he could see that Telemachus        600"
1790,BOOK IV.,"came of good family. He had a piece of plate, of very"
1791,BOOK IV.,"great value, which was just the thing, and Telemachus"
1792,BOOK IV.,should have it.
1793,BOOK IV.,
1794,BOOK IV.,"[Guests now kept coming to the king's house, bringing         621"
1795,BOOK IV.,"both wine and sheep, and their wives had put them up"
1796,BOOK IV.,"a provision of bread. Thus, then, did they set about"
1797,BOOK IV.,cooking their dinner in the courts.][11]
1798,BOOK IV.,
1799,BOOK IV.,"Meanwhile, the suitors in Ithaca were playing at quoits,      625"
1800,BOOK IV.,"aiming spears at a mark, and behaving with all their"
1801,BOOK IV.,old insolence on the level ground in front of Ulysses'
1802,BOOK IV.,house. While they were thus engaged Noëmon came up and
1803,BOOK IV.,asked Antinous if he could say when Telemachus was likely
1804,BOOK IV.,"to be back from Pylos, for he wanted his ship. On this"
1805,BOOK IV.,"everything came out, and the suitors, who had no idea"
1806,BOOK IV.,that Telemachus had really gone (for they thought he
1807,BOOK IV.,"was only away on one of his farms in Ithaca), were very"
1808,BOOK IV.,angry. They therefore determined to lie in wait for him
1809,BOOK IV.,"on his return, and made ready to start."
1810,BOOK IV.,
1811,BOOK IV.,"Medon, a servant, overhead their plot, and told all to        675"
1812,BOOK IV.,"Penelope, who, like the suitors, learned for the first"
1813,BOOK IV.,time that her son had left home and gone to Pylos. She
1814,BOOK IV.,bitterly upbraided her women for not having given her
1815,BOOK IV.,"a call out of her bed when Telemachus was leaving, for"
1816,BOOK IV.,"she said she was sure they knew all about it. Presently,"
1817,BOOK IV.,"however, on being calmed by Euryclea, she went upstairs"
1818,BOOK IV.,and offered sacrifice to Minerva. After a time she fell
1819,BOOK IV.,"into a deep slumber, during which she was comforted by a"
1820,BOOK IV.,"vision of her sister Ipthime, which Minerva had sent to"
1821,BOOK IV.,her bedside.

1850,BOOK V.,"gone she went to look for Ulysses, whom she found weeping"

1852,BOOK V.,told him to build himself a raft and sail home upon

1870,BOOK V.,
1871,BOOK V.,The next four days were spent in making the raft. Calypso     228

1873,BOOK V.,grew which would be driest and whose timber would be the      240

1875,BOOK V.,raft about as broad in the beam as people generally make
1876,BOOK V.,"a good big ship, and he gave it a rudder--that he might       255"
1877,BOOK V.,be able to steer it.
1878,BOOK V.,
1879,BOOK V.,"Calypso then washed him, gave him clean clothes, and he       264"

1958,BOOK VI.,"Nausicaa, on waking, told her father and mother about          50"
1959,BOOK VI.,"her dream, ""Papa, dear,""[13] said she, ""could you manage"
1960,BOOK VI.,to let me have a good big waggon? I want to take all our
1961,BOOK VI.,dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are the
1962,BOOK VI.,"chief man here, so it is only proper that you should have      60"
1963,BOOK VI.,a clean shirt when you attend meetings of the council.
1964,BOOK VI.,"Moreover you have five sons, two of them married, while"
1965,BOOK VI.,the other three are good looking young bachelors; you
1966,BOOK VI.,know they always like to have clean linen when they go
1967,BOOK VI.,"out to a dance."""
1968,BOOK VI.,
1969,BOOK VI.,Her father promised her all she wanted. The waggon             71
1970,BOOK VI.,"was made ready, her mother put her up a basket of"
1971,BOOK VI.,"provisions, and Nausicaa drove her maids to the bank of"
1972,BOOK VI.,"the river, where were the cisterns, through which there"
1973,BOOK VI.,flowed enough clear water to wash clothes however dirty
1974,BOOK VI.,they might be. They washed their clothes in the pits
1975,BOOK VI.,"by treading upon them, laid them out to dry upon the"
1976,BOOK VI.,"sea-beach, had their dinner as the clothes were drying,"
1977,BOOK VI.,and then began to play at ball while Nausicaa sang to
1978,BOOK VI.,them.
1979,BOOK VI.,
1980,BOOK VI.,"In the course of time, when they were thinking about          110"
1981,BOOK VI.,"starting home, Minerva woke Ulysses, who was in the wood"
1982,BOOK VI.,"just above them. He sat up, heard the voices and laughter"
1983,BOOK VI.,"of the women, and wondered where he was."
1984,BOOK VI.,
1985,BOOK VI.,"He resolved on going to see, but remembering that he had      127"
1986,BOOK VI.,"no clothes on, he held a bough of olive before him, and"
1987,BOOK VI.,"then, all grim, naked, and unkempt as he was, he came"
1988,BOOK VI.,"out and drew near to the women, who all of them ran away"
1989,BOOK VI.,along the beach and the points that jutted into the sea.
1990,BOOK VI.,"Nausicaa, however, stood firm, and Ulysses set himself"
1991,BOOK VI.,to consider whether he should go boldly up to her and
1992,BOOK VI.,"embrace her knees, or speak to her from a respectful"
1993,BOOK VI.,distance.
1994,BOOK VI.,
1995,BOOK VI.,On the whole he concluded that this would be the most         145
1996,BOOK VI.,"prudent course; and having adopted it, he began by asking"
1997,BOOK VI.,Nausicaa to inform him whether she was a goddess or no.
1998,BOOK VI.,"If she was a goddess, it was obvious from her beauty that"
1999,BOOK VI.,she could only be Diana. If on the other hand she was
2000,BOOK VI.,"a mortal, how happy would he be whose proposals in the"
2001,BOOK VI.,"way of settlements had seemed most advantageous, and who"
2002,BOOK VI.,should take her to his own home. Finally he asked her
2003,BOOK VI.,to be kind enough to give him any old wrapper which she
2004,BOOK VI.,"might have brought with her to wrap the clothes in, and"
2005,BOOK VI.,to show him the way to the town.
2006,BOOK VI.,
2007,BOOK VI.,Nausicaa replied that he seemed really to be a very           186
2008,BOOK VI.,"sensible person, but that people must put up with their"
2009,BOOK VI.,luck whatever it might happen to be. She then explained
2010,BOOK VI.,"that he had come to the land of the Phæacians, and"
2011,BOOK VI.,promised to conduct him to their city.
2012,BOOK VI.,
2013,BOOK VI.,"Having so said, she told her maids not to be such             198"
2014,BOOK VI.,"cowards. ""The man,"" she said, ""is quite harmless; we live"
2015,BOOK VI.,"away from all neighbours on a land's end, with the sea"
2016,BOOK VI.,"roaring on either side of us, and no one can hurt us. See"
2017,BOOK VI.,"to this poor fellow, therefore, and give him something to"
2018,BOOK VI.,"eat."""
2019,BOOK VI.,
2020,BOOK VI.,When they heard this the maids came back and gave             211
2021,BOOK VI.,Ulysses a shirt and cloak; they also gave him a bottle
2022,BOOK VI.,"of oil and told him to go and wash in the river, but he"
2023,BOOK VI.,"said, ""I will not wash myself while you keep standing"
2024,BOOK VI.,there. I cannot bring myself to strip before a number of
2025,BOOK VI.,"good-looking young women."" So they went and told their"
2026,BOOK VI.,mistress.
2027,BOOK VI.,
2028,BOOK VI.,"When Ulysses had done washing, Minerva made him look much     224"
2029,BOOK VI.,"grander and more imposing, and gave him a thick head of"
2030,BOOK VI.,hair which flowed down in hyacinthine curls about his
2031,BOOK VI.,"shoulders, Nausicaa was very much struck with the change"
2032,BOOK VI.,"in his appearance. ""At first,"" she said, ""I thought him"
2033,BOOK VI.,"quite plain, but now he is of godlike beauty. I wish I"
2034,BOOK VI.,"might have such a man as that for my husband, if he would"
2035,BOOK VI.,"only stay here. But never mind this; girls, give him"
2036,BOOK VI.,"something to eat and drink."""
2037,BOOK VI.,
2038,BOOK VI.,"The maids then set meat and drink before Ulysses, who was     247"
2039,BOOK VI.,"ravenously hungry. While he was eating, Nausicaa got the"
2040,BOOK VI.,clothes folded up and put on to the cart; after which
2041,BOOK VI.,"she gave him his instructions. ""Follow after the cart,"""
2042,BOOK VI.,"she said, ""along with the maids, till you get near the"
2043,BOOK VI.,"houses. As for the town, you will find it lying between"
2044,BOOK VI.,"two good harbours, and approached by a narrow neck of         263"
2045,BOOK VI.,"land, on either side of which you will see the ships"
2046,BOOK VI.,drawn up--for every man has a place where he can let his
2047,BOOK VI.,"boat lie. You will also see the walls, and the temple of"
2048,BOOK VI.,"Neptune standing in the middle of the paved market-place,"
2049,BOOK VI.,with the ship-brokers' shops all round it.
2050,BOOK VI.,
2051,BOOK VI.,"""When you get near the town drop behind, for the people       273"
2052,BOOK VI.,"here are very ill-natured, and they would talk about me."
2053,BOOK VI.,"They would say, 'Who is this fine looking stranger that"
2054,BOOK VI.,is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I
2055,BOOK VI.,suppose she is going to marry him. Is he a sailor whom
2056,BOOK VI.,"she has picked up from some foreign vessel, or has a god"
2057,BOOK VI.,come down from heaven in answer to her prayers and he is
2058,BOOK VI.,going to marry her? It would be a good thing if she would
2059,BOOK VI.,"go and find a husband somewhere else, for she will have"
2060,BOOK VI.,nothing to say to any of the many excellent Phæacians who
2061,BOOK VI.,"are in love with her.' This is what people would say,"
2062,BOOK VI.,"and I could not blame them, for I should be scandalised"
2063,BOOK VI.,"myself if I saw any girl going about with a stranger,"
2064,BOOK VI.,"while her father and mother were yet alive, without being"
2065,BOOK VI.,married to him in the face of all the world.
2066,BOOK VI.,
2067,BOOK VI.,"""Do then as I say. When you come to the grove of Minerva      289"
2068,BOOK VI.,"a little outside the town, wait till you think I and the"
2069,BOOK VI.,"maids must have got home. Then come after us, ask which"
2070,BOOK VI.,"is Alcinous's house, and when you reach it go straight"
2071,BOOK VI.,through the outer and inner courts till you come to my
2072,BOOK VI.,mother. You will see her sitting with her back to a
2073,BOOK VI.,"bearing-post, and spinning her purple yarn by the fire."
2074,BOOK VI.,My father will be sitting close by her; never mind about
2075,BOOK VI.,"him, but go and embrace my mother's knees for if she"
2076,BOOK VI.,"looks favourably on your suit, you will probably get what"
2077,BOOK VI.,"you want."""
2078,BOOK VI.,
2079,BOOK VI.,"Nausicaa then drove on, and as the sun was about setting      316"
2080,BOOK VI.,"they came to the grove of Minerva, where Ulysses sat down"
2081,BOOK VI.,"and waited. He prayed Minerva to assist him, and she"
2082,BOOK VI.,"heard his prayer, but she would not manifest herself to"
2083,BOOK VI.,"him, for she did not want to offend her uncle Neptune."

2131,BOOK VII.,"went on to the house of Alcinous, and he pondered much"
2132,BOOK VII.,as he paused awhile before he reached the threshold of
2133,BOOK VII.,"bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of"
2134,BOOK VII.,the sun and moon. The walls on either side were of bronze
2135,BOOK VII.,"from end to end, and the cornice was of blue enamel. The"
2136,BOOK VII.,doors were of gold and hung on pillars of silver that
2137,BOOK VII.,"rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was of"
2138,BOOK VII.,silver and the hook of the door was of gold.
2139,BOOK VII.,
2140,BOOK VII.,On either side there were gold and silver mastiffs which       91
2141,BOOK VII.,Vulcan with his consummate skill had fashioned expressly
2142,BOOK VII.,"to keep watch over the palace of King Alcinous, so they"
2143,BOOK VII.,were immortal and could never grow old. Seats were ranged
2144,BOOK VII.,"here and there all along the wall, from one end to the"
2145,BOOK VII.,"other, with coverings of fine woven work, which the women"
2146,BOOK VII.,of the house had made. Here the chief persons of the
2147,BOOK VII.,"Phæacians used to sit and eat and drink, for there was"
2148,BOOK VII.,abundance at all seasons; and there were golden figures
2149,BOOK VII.,"of young men with lighted torches in their hands, raised"
2150,BOOK VII.,on pedestals to give light to them that sat at meat.
2151,BOOK VII.,
2152,BOOK VII.,"There are fifty women servants in the house, some of          103"
2153,BOOK VII.,"whom are always grinding rich yellow grain at the mill,"
2154,BOOK VII.,"while others work at the loom and sit and spin, and their"
2155,BOOK VII.,shuttles go backwards and forwards like the fluttering of
2156,BOOK VII.,"aspen leaves, while the linen is so closely woven that it"
2157,BOOK VII.,will turn oil. As the Phæacians are the best sailors in
2158,BOOK VII.,"the world, so their women excel all others in weaving,"
2159,BOOK VII.,"for Minerva has taught them all manner of useful arts,"
2160,BOOK VII.,and they are very intelligent.
2161,BOOK VII.,
2162,BOOK VII.,Outside the gate of the outer court there is a large
2163,BOOK VII.,"garden[14] of about four acres, with a wall all round"
2164,BOOK VII.,"it. It is full of beautiful trees--pears, pomegranates,"
2165,BOOK VII.,and the most delicious apples. There are luscious figs
2166,BOOK VII.,"also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot"
2167,BOOK VII.,"nor fail all the year round, neither winter nor summer,"
2168,BOOK VII.,for the air is so soft that a new crop ripens before the
2169,BOOK VII.,"old has dropped. Pear grows on pear, apple on apple, and"
2170,BOOK VII.,"fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for there is"
2171,BOOK VII.,an excellent vineyard; on the level ground of a part of
2172,BOOK VII.,"this, the grapes are being made into raisins; on another"
2173,BOOK VII.,part they are being gathered; some are being trodden
2174,BOOK VII.,"in the wine-tubs; others, further on, have shed their"
2175,BOOK VII.,"blossom and are beginning to show fruit; others, again,"
2176,BOOK VII.,are just changing colour. In the furthest part of the
2177,BOOK VII.,ground there are beautifully arranged beds of flowers
2178,BOOK VII.,that are in bloom all the year round. Two streams go
2179,BOOK VII.,"through it, the one turned in ducts throughout the whole"
2180,BOOK VII.,"garden, while the other is carried under the ground of"
2181,BOOK VII.,"the outer court to the house itself, and the townspeople"
2182,BOOK VII.,"drew water from it. Such, then, were the splendours with"
2183,BOOK VII.,which heaven had endowed the house of King Alcinous.
2184,BOOK VII.,
2185,BOOK VII.,So here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about            133
2186,BOOK VII.,"him, but when he had looked long enough he crossed the"
2187,BOOK VII.,threshold and went within the precincts of the house.
2188,BOOK VII.,He passed through the crowd of guests who were nightly
2189,BOOK VII.,"visitors at the table of King Alcinous, and who were"
2190,BOOK VII.,then making their usual drink offering to Mercury before      137
2191,BOOK VII.,going for the night. He was still shrouded in the mist
2192,BOOK VII.,"of invisibility with which Minerva had invested him,"
2193,BOOK VII.,"and going up to Arete he embraced her knees, whereon he"
2194,BOOK VII.,suddenly became visible. Every one was greatly surprised
2195,BOOK VII.,"at seeing a man there, but Ulysses paid no attention to"
2196,BOOK VII.,"this, and at once implored the queen's assistance; he"
2197,BOOK VII.,then sat down among the ashes on the hearth.
2198,BOOK VII.,
2199,BOOK VII.,"Alcinous did not know what to do or say, nor yet did any      154"
2200,BOOK VII.,one else till one of the guests Echeneüs told him it was
2201,BOOK VII.,not creditable to him that a suppliant should be left
2202,BOOK VII.,thus grovelling among the ashes. Alcinous ought to give
2203,BOOK VII.,him a seat and set food before him. This was accordingly
2204,BOOK VII.,"done, and after Ulysses had finished eating Alcinous made"
2205,BOOK VII.,"a speech, in which he proposed that they should have a"
2206,BOOK VII.,"great banquet next day in their guest's honour, and then"
2207,BOOK VII.,provide him an escort to take him to his own home. This
2208,BOOK VII.,"was agreed to, and after a while the other guests went"
2209,BOOK VII.,home to bed.
2210,BOOK VII.,
2211,BOOK VII.,When they were gone Ulysses was left alone with Alcinous      230
2212,BOOK VII.,"and Arete sitting over the fire, while the servants were"
2213,BOOK VII.,"taking the things away after supper. Then Arete said,"
2214,BOOK VII.,"""Stranger, before we go any further there is a question I"
2215,BOOK VII.,should like to put to you. Who are you? and who gave you
2216,BOOK VII.,"those clothes?"" for she recognised the shirt and cloak"
2217,BOOK VII.,"Ulysses was wearing as her own work, and that of her"
2218,BOOK VII.,maids.
2219,BOOK VII.,
2220,BOOK VII.,"Ulysses did not give his name, but told her how he had        240"
2221,BOOK VII.,"come from Calypso's island, and been wrecked on the"
2222,BOOK VII.,"Phæacian coast. ""Next day,"" he said, ""I fell in with your"
2223,BOOK VII.,"daughter, who treated me with much greater kindness than"
2224,BOOK VII.,one could have expected from so young a person--for young
2225,BOOK VII.,people are apt to be thoughtless. It was she who gave me
2226,BOOK VII.,"the clothes."""
2227,BOOK VII.,
2228,BOOK VII.,Alcinous then said he wished the stranger would stay with     308
2229,BOOK VII.,them for good and all and marry Nausicaa. They would
2230,BOOK VII.,"not, however, press this, and if he insisted on going"
2231,BOOK VII.,"they would send him, no matter where. ""Even though it be"
2232,BOOK VII.,"further than Eubœa, which they say is further off than"
2233,BOOK VII.,"any other place, we will send you, and you shall be taken"
2234,BOOK VII.,"so easily that you may sleep the whole way if you like.""      318"
2235,BOOK VII.,
2236,BOOK VII.,To this Ulysses only replied by praying that the king         329
2237,BOOK VII.,might be as good as his word. A bed was then made for him
2238,BOOK VII.,in the gate-house and they all retired for the night.

2249,BOOK VIII.,When morning came Alcinous called an assembly of the
2250,BOOK VIII.,"Phæacian, and Minerva went about urging every one to"
2251,BOOK VIII.,come and see the wonderful stranger. She also gave
2252,BOOK VIII.,Ulysses a more imposing presence that he might impress
2253,BOOK VIII.,the people favourably. When the Phæacians were assembled
2254,BOOK VIII.,Alcinous said:--
2255,BOOK VIII.,
2256,BOOK VIII.,"""I do not know who this stranger is, nor where he comes        28"
2257,BOOK VIII.,"from; but he wants us to send him to his own home, and no"
2258,BOOK VIII.,guest of mine was ever yet able to complain that I did
2259,BOOK VIII.,not send him home quickly enough. Let us therefore fit
2260,BOOK VIII.,"out a new ship with a crew of fifty-two men, and send"
2261,BOOK VIII.,him. The crew shall come to my house and I will find them
2262,BOOK VIII.,in food which they can cook for themselves. The aldermen
2263,BOOK VIII.,and councillors shall be feasted inside the house. I can
2264,BOOK VIII.,"take no denial, and we will have Demodocus to sing to us."""
2265,BOOK VIII.,
2266,BOOK VIII.,"The ship and crew were immediately found, and the sailors      46"
2267,BOOK VIII.,with all the male part of the population swarmed to the
2268,BOOK VIII.,house of Alcinous till the yards and barns and buildings
2269,BOOK VIII.,"were crowded. The king provided them with twelve sheep,"
2270,BOOK VIII.,"eight pigs and two bullocks, which they killed and cooked."
2271,BOOK VIII.,
2272,BOOK VIII.,The leading men of the town went inside the inner              62
2273,BOOK VIII.,"courtyard; Pontonous, the _major domo_, conducted the"
2274,BOOK VIII.,blind bard Demodocus to a seat which he set near one
2275,BOOK VIII.,of the bearing-posts that supported the roof of the
2276,BOOK VIII.,"cloisters, hung his lyre on a peg over his head, and"
2277,BOOK VIII.,shewed him how to feel for it with his hands. He also set
2278,BOOK VIII.,"a table close by him with refreshments on it, to which he"
2279,BOOK VIII.,could help himself whenever he liked.
2280,BOOK VIII.,
2281,BOOK VIII.,As soon as the guests had done eating Demodocus began          72
2282,BOOK VIII.,to sing the quarrel between Ulysses and Achilles before
2283,BOOK VIII.,"Troy, a lay which at the time was famous. This so"
2284,BOOK VIII.,affected Ulysses that he kept on weeping as long as the
2285,BOOK VIII.,"bard sang, and though he was able to conceal his tears"
2286,BOOK VIII.,"from the company generally, Alcinous perceived his"
2287,BOOK VIII.,"distress, and proposed that they should all now adjourn"
2288,BOOK VIII.,to the athletic sports--which were to consist mainly of
2289,BOOK VIII.,"boxing, wrestling, jumping, and foot racing."
2290,BOOK VIII.,
2291,BOOK VIII.,"Demodocus, therefore, hung the lyre on its peg and            105"
2292,BOOK VIII.,was led out to the place where the sports were to be
2293,BOOK VIII.,held. The whole town flocked to see them. Clytoneüs won
2294,BOOK VIII.,"the foot race, Euryalus took the prize for wrestling,"
2295,BOOK VIII.,"Amphialus was the best jumper, and Alcinous' son Laodamas"
2296,BOOK VIII.,the best boxer.
2297,BOOK VIII.,
2298,BOOK VIII.,Laodamas and Euryalus then proposed that Ulysses should       131
2299,BOOK VIII.,enter himself for one of the prizes. Ulysses replied
2300,BOOK VIII.,"that he was a stranger and a suppliant; moreover, he had"
2301,BOOK VIII.,"lately gone through great hardships, and would rather be"
2302,BOOK VIII.,excused.
2303,BOOK VIII.,
2304,BOOK VIII.,"Euryalus on this insulted Ulysses, and said that he           138"
2305,BOOK VIII.,supposed he was some grasping merchant who thought of
2306,BOOK VIII.,"nothing but his freights. ""You have none of the look,"""
2307,BOOK VIII.,"said he, ""of an athlete about you."""
2308,BOOK VIII.,
2309,BOOK VIII.,"Ulysses was furious, and told Euryalus that he was a          164"
2310,BOOK VIII.,goodlooking young fool. He then took up a disc far
2311,BOOK VIII.,heavier than those which the Phæacians were in the habit
2312,BOOK VIII.,of throwing.[15] The disc made a hurtling sound as it
2313,BOOK VIII.,"passed through the air, and easily surpassed any throw"
2314,BOOK VIII.,that had been made yet. Thus encouraged he made another
2315,BOOK VIII.,"long and very angry speech, in which he said he would"
2316,BOOK VIII.,compete with any Phæacian in any contest they chose to
2317,BOOK VIII.,"name, except in running, for he was still so much pulled"
2318,BOOK VIII.,"down that he thought they might beat him here. ""Also,"""
2319,BOOK VIII.,"he said, ""I will not compete in anything with Laodamas."
2320,BOOK VIII.,"He is my host's son, and it is a most unwise thing for a"
2321,BOOK VIII.,guest to challenge any member of his host's family. A man
2322,BOOK VIII.,"must be an idiot to think of such a thing."""
2323,BOOK VIII.,
2324,BOOK VIII.,"""Sir,"" said Alcinous, ""I understand that you are              236"
2325,BOOK VIII.,displeased at some remarks that have fallen from one of
2326,BOOK VIII.,"our athletes, who has thrown doubt upon your prowess in"
2327,BOOK VIII.,a way that no gentleman would do. I hear that you have
2328,BOOK VIII.,also given us a general challenge. I should explain that
2329,BOOK VIII.,"we are not famous for our skill in boxing or wrestling,"
2330,BOOK VIII.,but are singularly fleet runners and bold mariners.
2331,BOOK VIII.,"We are also much given to song and dance, and we like"
2332,BOOK VIII.,warm baths and frequent changes of linen. So now come
2333,BOOK VIII.,"forward some of you who are the nimblest dancers, and"
2334,BOOK VIII.,show the stranger how much we surpass other nations in
2335,BOOK VIII.,all graceful accomplishments. Let some one also bring
2336,BOOK VIII.,"Demodocus's lyre from my house where he has left it."""
2337,BOOK VIII.,
2338,BOOK VIII.,"The lyre was immediately brought, the dancers began to        256"
2339,BOOK VIII.,"dance, and Ulysses admired the merry twinkling of their"
2340,BOOK VIII.,feet.
2341,BOOK VIII.,
2342,BOOK VIII.,While they were dancing Demodocus sang the intrigue           266
2343,BOOK VIII.,"between Mars and Venus in the house of Vulcan, and told"
2344,BOOK VIII.,how Vulcan took the pair prisoners. All the gods came to
2345,BOOK VIII.,see them; but the goddesses were modest and would not         324
2346,BOOK VIII.,come.
2347,BOOK VIII.,
2348,BOOK VIII.,Alcinous then made Halius and Laodamas have a game at         370
2349,BOOK VIII.,"ball, after which Ulysses expressed the utmost admiration"
2350,BOOK VIII.,of their skill. Charmed with the compliment Ulysses had
2351,BOOK VIII.,"paid his sons, the king said that the twelve aldermen"
2352,BOOK VIII.,"(with himself, which would make thirteen) must at once"
2353,BOOK VIII.,"give Ulysses a shirt and cloak and a talent of gold, so"
2354,BOOK VIII.,that he might eat his supper with a light heart. As for
2355,BOOK VIII.,"Euryalus, he must not only make a present, but apologise"
2356,BOOK VIII.,"as well, for he had been rude."
2357,BOOK VIII.,
2358,BOOK VIII.,"Euryalus admitted his fault, and gave Ulysses his sword       398"
2359,BOOK VIII.,"with its scabbard, which was of new ivory. He said"
2360,BOOK VIII.,Ulysses would find it worth a great deal of money to him.
2361,BOOK VIII.,
2362,BOOK VIII.,"Ulysses thanked him, wished him all manner of good            412"
2363,BOOK VIII.,"fortune, and said he hoped Euryalus would not feel the"
2364,BOOK VIII.,want of the sword which he had just given him along with
2365,BOOK VIII.,his apology.
2366,BOOK VIII.,
2367,BOOK VIII.,"Night was now falling, they therefore adjourned to the        417"
2368,BOOK VIII.,"house of Alcinous. Here the presents began to arrive,"
2369,BOOK VIII.,whereon the king desired Arete to find Ulysses a chest in
2370,BOOK VIII.,"which to stow them, and to put a shirt and clean cloak"
2371,BOOK VIII.,in it as his own contribution; he also declared his
2372,BOOK VIII.,"intention of giving him a gold cup.[16] Meanwhile, he"
2373,BOOK VIII.,said that Ulysses had better have a warm bath.
2374,BOOK VIII.,
2375,BOOK VIII.,The bath was made ready. Arete packed all the gold and        423
2376,BOOK VIII.,"presents which the Phæacian aldermen had sent, as also"
2377,BOOK VIII.,the shirt and tunic from Alcinous. Arete told Ulysses to
2378,BOOK VIII.,"see to the fastening, lest some one should rob him while"
2379,BOOK VIII.,he was asleep on the ship; Ulysses therefore fastened the     445
2380,BOOK VIII.,lid on to the chest with a knot which Circe had taught
2381,BOOK VIII.,"him. He then went into the bath room--very gladly, for he"
2382,BOOK VIII.,"had not had a bath since he left Calypso, who as long as"
2383,BOOK VIII.,he was with her had taken as good care of him as though
2384,BOOK VIII.,he had been a god.
2385,BOOK VIII.,
2386,BOOK VIII.,As he came from the bath room Nausicaa was standing by        457
2387,BOOK VIII.,one of the bearing-posts that supported the roof of
2388,BOOK VIII.,"the cloisters and bade him farewell, reminding him at"
2389,BOOK VIII.,the same time that it was she who had been the saving
2390,BOOK VIII.,of him--a fact which Ulysses in a few words gracefully
2391,BOOK VIII.,acknowledged.
2392,BOOK VIII.,
2393,BOOK VIII.,"He then took his seat at table, and after dinner, at his      469"
2394,BOOK VIII.,"request, Demodocus sang the Sack of Troy and the Sally of"
2395,BOOK VIII.,the Achæans from the Wooden Horse. This again so affected
2396,BOOK VIII.,"him that he could not restrain his tears, which, however,"
2397,BOOK VIII.,Alcinous again alone perceived.
2398,BOOK VIII.,
2399,BOOK VIII.,"The king, therefore, made a speech in which he said           536"
2400,BOOK VIII.,that the stranger ought to tell them his name. He must
2401,BOOK VIII.,"have one, for people always gave their children names"
2402,BOOK VIII.,as soon as they were born. He need not be uneasy about
2403,BOOK VIII.,his escort. All he had to do was to say where he wanted
2404,BOOK VIII.,"to go, and the Phæacian ships were so clever that they"
2405,BOOK VIII.,would take him there of their own accord. Nevertheless he
2406,BOOK VIII.,"remembered hearing his father Nausithous say, that one"
2407,BOOK VIII.,day Neptune would be angry with the Phæacians for giving
2408,BOOK VIII.,"people escorts so readily, and had said he would wreck"
2409,BOOK VIII.,"one of their ships as it was returning, and would also"
2410,BOOK VIII.,bury their city under a high mountain.

2423,BOOK IX.,"my name and I will tell you. I am Ulysses, and dwell in"
2424,BOOK IX.,"Ithaca, an island which contains a high mountain called"
2425,BOOK IX.,Neritum. In its neighbourhood there are other islands
2426,BOOK IX.,"near to one another, Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus. It"
2427,BOOK IX.,lies on the horizon all highest up in the sea towards the      25
2428,BOOK IX.,"West, while the other islands lie away from it to the"
2429,BOOK IX.,"East. This is the island which I would reach, for however"
2430,BOOK IX.,fine a house a man may have in a land where his parents
2431,BOOK IX.,"are not, there will still be nothing sweeter to him than"

2433,BOOK IX.,
2434,BOOK IX.,"""I will now tell you of my adventures. On leaving Troy         37"
2435,BOOK IX.,"we first made a descent on the land of the Cicons, and"
2436,BOOK IX.,"sacked their city but were eventually beaten off, though"
2437,BOOK IX.,we took our booty with us.
2438,BOOK IX.,
2439,BOOK IX.,"""Thence we sailed South with a strong North wind behind        62"
2440,BOOK IX.,"us, till we reached the island of Cythera, where we were"
2441,BOOK IX.,driven off our course by a continuance of North wind
2442,BOOK IX.,which prevented my doubling Cape Malea.
2443,BOOK IX.,
2444,BOOK IX.,"""Nine days was I driven by foul winds, and on the tenth        82"
2445,BOOK IX.,"we reached the land of the Lotus eaters, where the people"

2447,BOOK IX.,"which made them lose all desire to return home, so that I"
2448,BOOK IX.,had a great work to get those who had tasted it on board
2449,BOOK IX.,again.
2450,BOOK IX.,
2451,BOOK IX.,"""Thence we were carried further, till we came to the land     105"
2452,BOOK IX.,"of the savage Cyclopes. Off their coast, but not very"
2453,BOOK IX.,"far, there is a wooded island abounding with wild goats."
2454,BOOK IX.,"It is untrodden by the foot of man; even the huntsmen,"
2455,BOOK IX.,who as a general rule will suffer any hardship in forest      120
2456,BOOK IX.,"or on mountain top, never go there; it is neither tilled"
2457,BOOK IX.,"nor fed down, but remains year after year uninhabited"
2458,BOOK IX.,"save by goats only. For the Cyclopes have no ships, and"
2459,BOOK IX.,cannot therefore go from place to place as those who have
2460,BOOK IX.,ships can do. If they had ships they would have colonised
2461,BOOK IX.,"the island, for it is not at all a bad one and would"
2462,BOOK IX.,bring forth all things in their season. There is meadow
2463,BOOK IX.,"land, well watered and of good quality, that stretches"
2464,BOOK IX.,down to the water's edge. Grapes would do wonderfully
2465,BOOK IX.,"well there; it contains good arable land, which would"
2466,BOOK IX.,"yield heavy crops, for the soil is rich; moreover it has"
2467,BOOK IX.,a convenient port--into which some god must have taken
2468,BOOK IX.,"us, for the night was so dark that we could see nothing."
2469,BOOK IX.,"There was a thick darkness all round the ships, neither"
2470,BOOK IX.,"was there any moon, for the sky was covered with clouds."
2471,BOOK IX.,"No one could see the island, nor yet waves breaking upon"
2472,BOOK IX.,"the shore till we found ourselves in the harbour. Here,"
2473,BOOK IX.,"then, we moored our ships and camped down upon the beach."

2484,BOOK IX.,"land of the Cyclopes over against us, which was so near"
2485,BOOK IX.,"that we could see the smoke of their stubble fires, and"
2486,BOOK IX.,almost fancy we heard the bleating of their sheep and
2487,BOOK IX.,goats.
2488,BOOK IX.,
2489,BOOK IX.,"""We camped a second night upon the beach, and at day          169"
2490,BOOK IX.,"break, having called a council, I said I would take my"
2491,BOOK IX.,"own ship and reconnoitre the country, but would leave"
2492,BOOK IX.,"the other ships at the island. Thereon I started, but"
2493,BOOK IX.,when we got near the main land we saw a great cave in the
2494,BOOK IX.,"cliff, not far from the sea, and there were large sheep"
2495,BOOK IX.,yards in front of it. On landing I chose twelve men and
2496,BOOK IX.,"went inland, taking with me a goat skin full of a very"
2497,BOOK IX.,"wondrous wine that Maron, priest of Apollo, had given me"
2498,BOOK IX.,when I spared his life and that of his family at the time
2499,BOOK IX.,that we were sacking the city of the Cicons. The rest of
2500,BOOK IX.,my crew were to wait my return by the sea side.
2501,BOOK IX.,
2502,BOOK IX.,"""We soon reached the cave, and finding that the owner was     216"
2503,BOOK IX.,not at home we examined all that it contained; we saw
2504,BOOK IX.,"vessels brimful of whey, and racks loaded with cheeses:"
2505,BOOK IX.,the yards also were full of lambs and kids. My men
2506,BOOK IX.,"implored me to let them steal some cheeses, drive off"
2507,BOOK IX.,"some of the lambs and kids, and sail away, but I would"
2508,BOOK IX.,"not, for I hoped the owner might give me something."
2509,BOOK IX.,
2510,BOOK IX.,"""We lit a fire in the cave, sacrificed some of the            233"
2511,BOOK IX.,"cheeses to the gods, and ate others ourselves, waiting"
2512,BOOK IX.,till the owner should return. When he came we found him
2513,BOOK IX.,"to be a huge monster, more like a peak standing out"
2514,BOOK IX.,against the sky on some high mountain than a human
2515,BOOK IX.,"being. He brought in with him a great bundle of firewood,"
2516,BOOK IX.,which he flung down upon the floor with such a noise that
2517,BOOK IX.,we were scared and hid ourselves. He drove all his female
2518,BOOK IX.,"goats and ewes into the cave, but left the males outside;"
2519,BOOK IX.,and then he closed the door with a huge stone which not
2520,BOOK IX.,even two and twenty waggons could carry. He milked his        245
2521,BOOK IX.,"goats and ewes all orderly, and gave each one her own"
2522,BOOK IX.,young [for these had been left in the yards all day];
2523,BOOK IX.,"then he drank some of the milk, and put part by for his"
2524,BOOK IX.,"supper. Presently he lit his fire and caught sight of us,"
2525,BOOK IX.,whereon he asked us who we were.
2526,BOOK IX.,
2527,BOOK IX.,"""I told him we were on our way home from Troy, and begged     256"
2528,BOOK IX.,him in heaven's name to do us no hurt; but as soon as I
2529,BOOK IX.,"had answered his question he gripped up two of my men,"
2530,BOOK IX.,"dashed them on the ground, and ate them raw, blood,"
2531,BOOK IX.,"bones, and bowels, like a savage lion of the wilderness."
2532,BOOK IX.,Then he lay down on the ground of the cave and went to
2533,BOOK IX.,sleep: on which I should have crept up to him and plunged
2534,BOOK IX.,my sword into his heart while he was sleeping had I not
2535,BOOK IX.,known that if I did we should never be able to shift the
2536,BOOK IX.,stone. So we waited till dawn should come.
2537,BOOK IX.,
2538,BOOK IX.,"""When day broke the monster again lit his fire, milked        307"
2539,BOOK IX.,"his ewes all orderly, and gave each one her own young."
2540,BOOK IX.,"Then he gripped up two more of my men, and as soon as"
2541,BOOK IX.,he had eaten them he rolled the stone from the mouth of
2542,BOOK IX.,"the cave, drove out his sheep, and put the stone back"
2543,BOOK IX.,"again. He had, however, left a large and long piece of"
2544,BOOK IX.,"olive wood in the cave, and when he had gone I and my men"
2545,BOOK IX.,"sharpened this at one end, and hid it in the sheep dung"
2546,BOOK IX.,of which there was much in the cave. In the evening he
2547,BOOK IX.,"returned, milked his ewes, and ate two more men; whereon"
2548,BOOK IX.,I went up to him with the skin of wondrous wine that
2549,BOOK IX.,Maron had given me and gave him a bowl full of it. He
2550,BOOK IX.,"asked for another, and then another, so I gave them to"
2551,BOOK IX.,"him, and he was so much delighted that he enquired my"
2552,BOOK IX.,name and I said it was Noman.
2553,BOOK IX.,
2554,BOOK IX.,"""The wine now began to take effect, and in a short time       371"
2555,BOOK IX.,he fell dead drunk upon the ground. Then my men and I put
2556,BOOK IX.,the sharp end of the piece of olive wood in the fire till
2557,BOOK IX.,"it was well burning, and drove it into the wretch's eye,"
2558,BOOK IX.,turning it round and round as though it were an auger.
2559,BOOK IX.,"After a while he plucked it out, flung it from him, and"
2560,BOOK IX.,"began crying to his neighbours for help. When they came,"
2561,BOOK IX.,"they said, 'What ails you? Who is harming you?' and he"
2562,BOOK IX.,"answered, 'No man is harming me.' They then said that he"
2563,BOOK IX.,"must be ill, and had better pray to his father Neptune;"
2564,BOOK IX.,"so they went away, and I laughed at the success of my"
2565,BOOK IX.,stratagem.
2566,BOOK IX.,
2567,BOOK IX.,"""Then I hid my men by binding them under the sheep's          424"
2568,BOOK IX.,"bellies. The Cyclops, whose name was Polyphemus, groped"
2569,BOOK IX.,"his way to the stone, rolled it away, and sat at the"
2570,BOOK IX.,mouth of the cave feeling the sheep's backs as they went
2571,BOOK IX.,out; but the men were under their bellies so he did not
2572,BOOK IX.,"find one of them. Nor yet did he discover me, for I was"
2573,BOOK IX.,ensconced in the thick belly-fleece of a ram which by
2574,BOOK IX.,some chance he had brought in with the ewes. But he was
2575,BOOK IX.,"near finding me, for the ram went last, and he kept it"
2576,BOOK IX.,for a while and talked to it.
2577,BOOK IX.,
2578,BOOK IX.,"""When we were outside, I dropped from under the ram and       462"
2579,BOOK IX.,"unbound my companions. We drove the ewes down to my ship,"
2580,BOOK IX.,"got them on board, and rowed out to sea. When we were"
2581,BOOK IX.,"a little way out I jeered at the Cyclops, whereon he"
2582,BOOK IX.,tore up a great rock and hurled it after us; it fell in
2583,BOOK IX.,"front of the ship and all but hit the rudder; the wash,"
2584,BOOK IX.,"moreover, that it made nearly carried us back to the          483"
2585,BOOK IX.,"land, but I kept the ship off it with a pole."
2586,BOOK IX.,
2587,BOOK IX.,"""When we had got about twice as far off as we were            491"
2588,BOOK IX.,"before, I was for speaking to the Cyclops again, and"
2589,BOOK IX.,"though my men tried to stay me, I shouted out to him"
2590,BOOK IX.,"'Cyclops, if you would know who it is that has blinded"
2591,BOOK IX.,"you, learn that it is I, Ulysses, son of Laertes, who"
2592,BOOK IX.,live in Ithaca.'
2593,BOOK IX.,
2594,BOOK IX.,"""'Alas,' he cried in answer, 'then the old prophecy about     506"
2595,BOOK IX.,me is coming true. I knew that I was to lose my sight by
2596,BOOK IX.,"the hand of Ulysses, but I was looking for some man of"
2597,BOOK IX.,"great stature and noble mien, whereas he has proved to"
2598,BOOK IX.,"be a mere whippersnapper. Come here, then, Ulysses that"
2599,BOOK IX.,I may offer you gifts of hospitality and pray my father
2600,BOOK IX.,"Neptune, who shall heal my eye, to escort you safely home."
2601,BOOK IX.,
2602,BOOK IX.,"""'I wish,' said I, 'that I could be as sure of killing        521"
2603,BOOK IX.,you body and soul as I am that not even Neptune will be
2604,BOOK IX.,able to cure your eye.'
2605,BOOK IX.,
2606,BOOK IX.,"""Then he prayed to Neptune saying 'Hear me Neptune, if        526"
2607,BOOK IX.,"I am indeed your son, and vouchsafe me that Ulysses son"
2608,BOOK IX.,"of Laertes may never reach his home. Still, if he must"
2609,BOOK IX.,"do so, and get back to his friends, let him lose all his"
2610,BOOK IX.,"men, and though he get home after all, let it be late,"
2611,BOOK IX.,"on another man's ship, and let him find trouble in his"
2612,BOOK IX.,house.'
2613,BOOK IX.,
2614,BOOK IX.,"""So saying he tore up a still larger rock and flung it        527"
2615,BOOK IX.,"this time a little behind the ship, but so close that it"
2616,BOOK IX.,"all but hit the rudder: the wash, however, that it made"
2617,BOOK IX.,carried us forward to the island from which we had set
2618,BOOK IX.,out.
2619,BOOK IX.,
2620,BOOK IX.,"""There we feasted on the sheep that we had taken, and         556"

2665,BOOK X.,a young woman who was coming down to fetch water from
2666,BOOK X.,"the spring Artacia, whence the people drew their water."
2667,BOOK X.,This young woman took my men to the house of her father
2668,BOOK X.,"Antiphates, whereon they discovered the people to be"
2669,BOOK X.,giants and ogres like Polyphemus. One of my men was
2670,BOOK X.,"gripped up and eaten, but the other two escaped and"
2671,BOOK X.,reached the ships. The Læstrygonians raised a hue and cry
2672,BOOK X.,"after them, and rushing to the harbour, within which all"
2673,BOOK X.,"my ships were moored except my own, they dashed my whole"
2674,BOOK X.,fleet in pieces with the rocks that they threw. I and my
2675,BOOK X.,"own ship alone escaped them, for we were outside, and I"
2676,BOOK X.,bade the men row for their lives.
2677,BOOK X.,
2678,BOOK X.,"""On and on did we sail, till we reached the island of         133"
2679,BOOK X.,"Circe, where heaven guided us into a harbour. Here I"
2680,BOOK X.,again climbed a rock and could see the smoke from Circe's
2681,BOOK X.,house rising out of a thick wood; I then went back to the
2682,BOOK X.,"ship, and while on my way had the good fortune to kill a"
2683,BOOK X.,"noble stag, which gave us a supply of meat on which we"
2684,BOOK X.,feasted all the rest of the day. Next morning I held a
2685,BOOK X.,council and told my men of the smoke that I had seen.
2686,BOOK X.,
2687,BOOK X.,"""Eurylochus and twenty-two men then went inland to            210"
2688,BOOK X.,"reconnoitre, and found Circe's house made of squared"
2689,BOOK X.,stones and standing on high ground in the middle of the
2690,BOOK X.,"forest. This forest was full of wild beasts, poor dazed"
2691,BOOK X.,"creatures whom Circe had bewitched, but they fawned upon"
2692,BOOK X.,my men and did not harm them. When the men got to the
2693,BOOK X.,door of her house they could hear her singing inside most
2694,BOOK X.,"beautifully, so they called her down, and when she came"
2695,BOOK X.,"she asked them in, gave them a drugged drink, and then"
2696,BOOK X.,turned them into pigs--all except Eurylochus who had
2697,BOOK X.,remained outside.
2698,BOOK X.,
2699,BOOK X.,"""Eurylochus made all haste back to tell me, and I started     244"
2700,BOOK X.,for Circe's house. When I was in the wood where the wild
2701,BOOK X.,"beasts were, Mercury met me and gave me an herb called        277"
2702,BOOK X.,"Moly, which would protect me from Circe's spells; he also     305"
2703,BOOK X.,"told me how I should treat her. Then I went to her house,"
2704,BOOK X.,and called her to come down.
2705,BOOK X.,
2706,BOOK X.,"""She asked me in, and tried to bewitch me as she had the      312"
2707,BOOK X.,"others, but the herb which Mercury had given me protected"
2708,BOOK X.,me; so I rushed at her with my drawn sword. When she
2709,BOOK X.,"saw this, she said she knew I must be Ulysses, and that"
2710,BOOK X.,"I must marry her at once. But I said, 'Circe, you have"
2711,BOOK X.,"just turned my men into pigs, and have done your best to"
2712,BOOK X.,bewitch me into the bargain; how can you expect me to be
2713,BOOK X.,"friendly with you? Still, if you will swear to take no"
2714,BOOK X.,"unfair advantage of me, I will consent.' So she swore,"
2715,BOOK X.,and I consented at once.
2716,BOOK X.,
2717,BOOK X.,"""Then she set the four maid servants of her house to wash     348"

2719,BOOK X.,"eat till Circe removed her spells from off my men, and"
2720,BOOK X.,brought them back safe and sound in human form. When she
2721,BOOK X.,had done this she bade me go back to my ship and bring
2722,BOOK X.,"the rest of my men--which I presently did, and we staid"
2723,BOOK X.,"with her for a whole twelve months, feasting continually"
2724,BOOK X.,"and drinking an untold quantity of wine. At last,"
2725,BOOK X.,"however, my men said that if I meant going home at all it"
2726,BOOK X.,was time I began to think of starting.
2727,BOOK X.,
2728,BOOK X.,"""That night, therefore, when I was in bed with Circe,         480"
2729,BOOK X.,"I told her how my men were murmuring, and asked her to"
2730,BOOK X.,let me go. This she said she would do; but I must first
2731,BOOK X.,"go down into the house of Hades, and consult the blind"
2732,BOOK X.,Theban prophet Tiresias. And she directed me what I
2733,BOOK X.,should do.
2734,BOOK X.,
2735,BOOK X.,"""On the following morning I told my men, and we began         551"
2736,BOOK X.,"to get ready; but we had an accident before we started,"
2737,BOOK X.,for there was a foolish and not very valiant young man
2738,BOOK X.,"in my ship named Elpenor, who had got drunk and had gone"
2739,BOOK X.,on to the roof of Circe's house to sleep off his liquor
2740,BOOK X.,"in the cool. The bustle my men made woke him, and in his"
2741,BOOK X.,"flurry he forgot all about coming down by the staircase,"
2742,BOOK X.,and fell right off the roof; whereby he broke his neck
2743,BOOK X.,"and was killed. We started, however, all the same, and"
2744,BOOK X.,Circe brought us a lamb and a black sheep to offer to
2745,BOOK X.,"the Shades below. She passed in and out among us, but we"
2746,BOOK X.,"could not see her; who, indeed, can see the gods, when"

3008,BOOK XII.,"""Shortly after this I saw smoke and a great wave ahead,       201"
3009,BOOK XII.,and heard a dull thumping sound. The sea was in an
3010,BOOK XII.,"uproar, and my men were so frightened that they loosed"
3011,BOOK XII.,"hold of their oars, till I put heart into them, bade"
3012,BOOK XII.,"them row their hardest, and told the steersman to hug"
3013,BOOK XII.,"the Scylla side. But I said nothing about Scylla, though"
3014,BOOK XII.,I kept straining my eyes all over her rock to see if I
3015,BOOK XII.,could espy her.
3016,BOOK XII.,
3017,BOOK XII.,"""So there we were, with Scylla on the one hand and dread      234"
3018,BOOK XII.,Charybdis on the other. We could see the sea seething as
3019,BOOK XII.,"in a cauldron, and the black ooze at the bottom with a"
3020,BOOK XII.,wall of whirling waters careering round it. While my men
3021,BOOK XII.,"were pale with fear at this awful sight, Scylla shot out"
3022,BOOK XII.,her long necks and swooped down on six of them. I could
3023,BOOK XII.,see their poor hands and feet struggling in the air as
3024,BOOK XII.,"she bore them aloft, and hear them call out my name in"
3025,BOOK XII.,one last despairing cry. This was the most horrid sight
3026,BOOK XII.,that I saw in all my voyages.
3027,BOOK XII.,
3028,BOOK XII.,"""Having passed the cliffs,[22] and Scylla and Charybdis,      260"
3029,BOOK XII.,"we came to the Thrinacian island, and from my ship I"
3030,BOOK XII.,"could hear the cattle lowing, and the sheep bleating."
3031,BOOK XII.,"Then, remembering the warning that Tiresias and Circe had"
3032,BOOK XII.,"given me, I bade my men give the island a wide berth. But"
3033,BOOK XII.,"Eurylochus was insolent, and sowed disaffection among"
3034,BOOK XII.,"them, so that I was forced to yield and let them land for"
3035,BOOK XII.,"the night, after making them swear most solemnly that"
3036,BOOK XII.,"they would do the cattle no harm. We camped, therefore,"
3037,BOOK XII.,on the beach near a stream.
3038,BOOK XII.,
3039,BOOK XII.,"""But in the third watch of the night there came up a          312"
3040,BOOK XII.,"great gale, and in the morning we drew our ship ashore"
3041,BOOK XII.,and left her in a large cave wherein the sea nymphs meet
3042,BOOK XII.,"and hold their dances. I then called my men together, and"
3043,BOOK XII.,again warned them.
3044,BOOK XII.,
3045,BOOK XII.,"""It blew a gale from the South for a whole month, except      325"
3046,BOOK XII.,"when the wind shifted to the East, and there was no"
3047,BOOK XII.,other wind save only South and East. As long as the corn
3048,BOOK XII.,"and wine which Circe had given us held out, my men kept"
3049,BOOK XII.,"their word, but after a time they began to feel the"
3050,BOOK XII.,"pangs of hunger, and I went apart to pray heaven to take"
3051,BOOK XII.,"compassion upon us. I washed my hands and prayed, and"
3052,BOOK XII.,"when I had done so, I fell asleep."
3053,BOOK XII.,
3054,BOOK XII.,"""Meanwhile Eurylochus set my men on to disobey me, and        339"
3055,BOOK XII.,they drove in some of the cattle and killed them. When
3056,BOOK XII.,"I woke, and had got nearly back to the ship, I began to"
3057,BOOK XII.,smell roast meat and knew full well what had happened.
3058,BOOK XII.,
3059,BOOK XII.,"""The nymph Lampetie went immediately and told the Sun         374"
3060,BOOK XII.,"what my men had done. He was furious, and threatened"
3061,BOOK XII.,Jove that if he was not revenged he would never shine in
3062,BOOK XII.,heaven again but would go down and give his light among
3063,BOOK XII.,"the dead. 'All day long,' said he, 'whether I was going"
3064,BOOK XII.,"up heaven or down, there was nothing I so dearly loved to"
3065,BOOK XII.,look upon as those cattle.'
3066,BOOK XII.,
3067,BOOK XII.,"""Jove told him he would wreck our ship as soon as it was      385"
3068,BOOK XII.,"well away from land, and the Sun said no more. I know all"
3069,BOOK XII.,"this because Calypso told me, and she had it from Mercury."
3070,BOOK XII.,
3071,BOOK XII.,"""My men feasted six days--alarmed by the most awful           397"
3072,BOOK XII.,prodigies; for the skins of the cattle kept walking
3073,BOOK XII.,"about, and the joints of meat lowed while they were being"
3074,BOOK XII.,roasted. On the seventh day the wind dropped and we got
3075,BOOK XII.,"away from the island, but as soon as we were out of sight"
3076,BOOK XII.,"of land a sudden squall sprang up, during which Jove"
3077,BOOK XII.,struck our ship with his thunderbolts and broke it up.
3078,BOOK XII.,"All my men were drowned, and so too should I have been,"
3079,BOOK XII.,had I not made myself a raft by lashing the mast (which I
3080,BOOK XII.,found floating about) and the ship's keel together.
3081,BOOK XII.,
3082,BOOK XII.,"[""The wind, which during the squall came from the West,       426"
3083,BOOK XII.,"now changed to the South, and blew all night, so that by"
3084,BOOK XII.,morning I was back between Scylla and Charybdis again.
3085,BOOK XII.,"My raft got carried down the whirlpool, but I clung on"
3086,BOOK XII.,"to the boughs of the fig tree, for a weary weary while,"
3087,BOOK XII.,during which I felt as impatient as a magistrate who is
3088,BOOK XII.,detained in court by troublesome cases when he wants to
3089,BOOK XII.,get home to dinner. But in the course of time my raft
3090,BOOK XII.,"worked its way out again, and when it was underneath me I"
3091,BOOK XII.,dropped on to it and was carried out of the pool. Happily
3092,BOOK XII.,for me Jove did not let Scylla see me.][23]
3093,BOOK XII.,
3094,BOOK XII.,"""Thence I was born along for nine days in the sea, and        447"
3095,BOOK XII.,was taken to the Ogygian island of Calypso. I told you

3106,BOOK XIII.,
3107,BOOK XIII.,
3108,BOOK XIII.,"Thus did Ulysses speak, and Alcinous immediately proposed"
3109,BOOK XIII.,that they should make him still further presents. The
3110,BOOK XIII.,"expence, however, of these, he said, should be borne"
3111,BOOK XIII.,by a levy or rate upon the public at large. The guests
3112,BOOK XIII.,"assented, and then went home to bed."
3113,BOOK XIII.,
3114,BOOK XIII.,Next morning they brought their presents of hardware down      18
3115,BOOK XIII.,"to the ship, and Alcinous saw them so stowed that they"
3116,BOOK XIII.,should not incommode the rowers. There was then a second
3117,BOOK XIII.,"banquet at Alcinous's house, but Ulysses kept looking"
3118,BOOK XIII.,"at the sun all the time, longing for it to set that he"
3119,BOOK XIII.,might start on his way. At last he rose and addressed the
3120,BOOK XIII.,"Phæacians; after thanking them, he concluded by saying"
3121,BOOK XIII.,that he hoped he should find his wife on his return
3122,BOOK XIII.,"living among her friends in peace and quietness,[24] and       43"
3123,BOOK XIII.,that the Phæacians would continue to give satisfaction
3124,BOOK XIII.,to their wives and children. He also bade farewell to
3125,BOOK XIII.,"Arete, and wished her all happiness with her children,"
3126,BOOK XIII.,"her people, and with King Alcinous."
3127,BOOK XIII.,
3128,BOOK XIII.,"When Ulysses reached the ship, a rug and sail were spread      73"
3129,BOOK XIII.,"for him, on which he lay down, and immediately fell into"
3130,BOOK XIII.,a deep sleep--so deep as to resemble death itself. The
3131,BOOK XIII.,ship sped on her way faster than a falcon's flight and         80
3132,BOOK XIII.,with the break of day they reached Ithaca.
3133,BOOK XIII.,
3134,BOOK XIII.,Now in Ithaca there is a sheltered harbour in which a          96
3135,BOOK XIII.,ship can ride without being even moored. At the head of
3136,BOOK XIII.,"this there is a large olive tree, near which there is a"
3137,BOOK XIII.,"cave sacred to the Naiads, where you may find their cups"
3138,BOOK XIII.,"and amphoræ of stone, and the stone looms whereon they"
3139,BOOK XIII.,weave their robes of sea-purple--very curious. The wild
3140,BOOK XIII.,"bees, too, build their nests in it. There is water in it"
3141,BOOK XIII.,"all the year round, and it has two entrances, one looking"
3142,BOOK XIII.,"North, by which mortals can go down into the cave, and"
3143,BOOK XIII.,"the other towards the South, but men cannot enter by"
3144,BOOK XIII.,it--it is the way taken by gods.
3145,BOOK XIII.,
3146,BOOK XIII.,"The sailors knew this harbour, and took the ship into it.     112"
3147,BOOK XIII.,They were rowing so hard that they ran half her length on
3148,BOOK XIII.,"to the shore, and when they had got out of her they took"
3149,BOOK XIII.,"Ulysses off, still fast asleep on his rug and sail, and"
3150,BOOK XIII.,laid him down on the ground. Hard by him they also laid
3151,BOOK XIII.,all the presents the Phæacians had made him; they left
3152,BOOK XIII.,"them by the roots of the olive tree, a little out of the"
3153,BOOK XIII.,"path, that no passer by might steal them, and then went"
3154,BOOK XIII.,back to Scheria.
3155,BOOK XIII.,
3156,BOOK XIII.,"Neptune now saw what the Phæacians had done, and went to      125"
3157,BOOK XIII.,consult Jove how he should be revenged. It was arranged
3158,BOOK XIII.,"that he should go to Scheria, turn the ship into stone"
3159,BOOK XIII.,"just as it was coming into port, and root it in the sea.      163"
3160,BOOK XIII.,"So he did this, and the Phæacians said, ""Alack, who has"
3161,BOOK XIII.,rooted the ship in the sea just as it was coming in? We
3162,BOOK XIII.,"could see all of it a minute ago."""
3163,BOOK XIII.,
3164,BOOK XIII.,Then Alcinous told them how Neptune had long ago              171
3165,BOOK XIII.,threatened to do this to some Phæacian ship on its return
3166,BOOK XIII.,"from giving an escort, and also to bury their city under"
3167,BOOK XIII.,a high mountain as a punishment for giving escorts so
3168,BOOK XIII.,"freely. The Phæacians, therefore, made ready great"
3169,BOOK XIII.,"sacrifices to Neptune, that he might have mercy upon them."
3170,BOOK XIII.,
3171,BOOK XIII.,"While they were thus standing round the altar of the god,     185"
3172,BOOK XIII.,"Ulysses woke in his own land, but he had been away so"
3173,BOOK XIII.,"long that he did not know it. Minerva, too, had shed a"
3174,BOOK XIII.,thick mist round him so that he might remain unseen while
3175,BOOK XIII.,she told him how things were going on; for she did not
3176,BOOK XIII.,want his wife or anyone else to know of his return until
3177,BOOK XIII.,he had taken his revenge upon the suitors. Therefore she
3178,BOOK XIII.,made everything look strange to him--the long straight
3179,BOOK XIII.,"paths, the harbours with their shipping, the steep"
3180,BOOK XIII.,"precipices, and the trees."
3181,BOOK XIII.,
3182,BOOK XIII.,Ulysses now stood up and wondered where he was. He did        197
3183,BOOK XIII.,not believe he was in Ithaca and complained bitterly
3184,BOOK XIII.,of the Phæacians for having brought him wrong. Then he
3185,BOOK XIII.,"counted all the tripods, cauldrons, gold, and raiment,"
3186,BOOK XIII.,"that they had given him, to see if he had been robbed;"
3187,BOOK XIII.,"but everything was there, and he was in dismay as to what"
3188,BOOK XIII.,he should do with them. As he was thus in doubt Minerva
3189,BOOK XIII.,"came up to him disguised as a young shepherd, so he asked"
3190,BOOK XIII.,"her what country he was in, and she answered that he was"
3191,BOOK XIII.,in Ithaca.
3192,BOOK XIII.,
3193,BOOK XIII.,Ulysses said he had heard that there was such a place; he     256
3194,BOOK XIII.,told Minerva a long lying story as to how he had come to
3195,BOOK XIII.,"be where she saw him, and on this the goddess assumed the"
3196,BOOK XIII.,"form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, and laughed at"
3197,BOOK XIII.,him for not knowing her. Ulysses answered that she was
3198,BOOK XIII.,not an easy person to recognise for she was continually
3199,BOOK XIII.,"changing her appearance. Moreover, though she had been"
3200,BOOK XIII.,"very good to him at Troy, she had left him in the lurch"
3201,BOOK XIII.,"ever since, until she had taken him into the city of the"
3202,BOOK XIII.,"Phæacians. ""Do not,"" he said, ""deceive me any further,"
3203,BOOK XIII.,"but tell me whether or no this is really Ithaca."""
3204,BOOK XIII.,
3205,BOOK XIII.,"""You are always cunning and suspicious,"" replied the          329"
3206,BOOK XIII.,"goddess, ""and that is why I cannot find it in my heart to"
3207,BOOK XIII.,leave you. Any one else on returning from a long voyage
3208,BOOK XIII.,would at once have gone up to his house to see his wife
3209,BOOK XIII.,"and children, but you do not seem to care about knowing"
3210,BOOK XIII.,"anything about them, and only think of testing your"
3211,BOOK XIII.,"wife's fidelity. As for my having left you in the lurch,      339"
3212,BOOK XIII.,I knew all the time that you would get home safely in the
3213,BOOK XIII.,"end, and I did not want to quarrel with my uncle Neptune."
3214,BOOK XIII.,I will now prove to you that you are in Ithaca--Here is
3215,BOOK XIII.,"the harbour of the old merman Phorcys, with the large         345"
3216,BOOK XIII.,olive tree at the head of it; near it is the cave which
3217,BOOK XIII.,"is sacred to the Naiads; here, again, is the overarching      347"
3218,BOOK XIII.,cavern in which you have sacrificed many a hecatomb to        349
3219,BOOK XIII.,"the nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain of Neritum.""      351"
3220,BOOK XIII.,
3221,BOOK XIII.,The goddess then dispersed the mist and let the prospect      352
3222,BOOK XIII.,"be seen. Ulysses was thus convinced, and Minerva helped"
3223,BOOK XIII.,him to hide the treasure which the Phæacians had given
3224,BOOK XIII.,"him, by concealing it in the cave. Having done this she"
3225,BOOK XIII.,bade Ulysses consider how he should kill the wicked
3226,BOOK XIII.,"suitors. ""They have been lording it,"" she said, ""in your"
3227,BOOK XIII.,"house this three years,[25] paying court to your wife"
3228,BOOK XIII.,"and making her gifts of wooing, while she, poor woman,        380"
3229,BOOK XIII.,"though she flatters them, and holds out hopes to every"
3230,BOOK XIII.,"man of them by sending him messages, is really plunged in"
3231,BOOK XIII.,"the deepest grief on your account, and does not mean a"
3232,BOOK XIII.,"word of what she says."""
3233,BOOK XIII.,
3234,BOOK XIII.,"""Great heavens,"" replied Ulysses, ""what a narrow escape I     382"
3235,BOOK XIII.,"have had from meeting the fate of Agamemnon. Stand by me,"
3236,BOOK XIII.,"goddess, and advise me how I shall be revenged."""
3237,BOOK XIII.,
3238,BOOK XIII.,"""I will disguise you,"" said Minerva, ""as a miserable old      397"
3239,BOOK XIII.,"beggar so that no one shall know you. ""When I have done"
3240,BOOK XIII.,"so, go to your swineherd, who has been always loyal to"
3241,BOOK XIII.,you and yours. You will find him with his pigs by the
3242,BOOK XIII.,fountain Arethusa near the rock that is called Raven.
3243,BOOK XIII.,"Meantime I will go to Sparta and fetch Telemachus, who is"
3244,BOOK XIII.,"gone thither to try and get news of you."""
3245,BOOK XIII.,
3246,BOOK XIII.,"""But why,"" Ulysses answered, ""did you not tell him, for       416"
3247,BOOK XIII.,"you knew all about it?"""
3248,BOOK XIII.,
3249,BOOK XIII.,"""Do not be uneasy about him,"" she answered, ""he is in the     420"
3250,BOOK XIII.,"midst of great abundance. I sent him, that he might get"
3251,BOOK XIII.,"himself a good name by having gone."""
3252,BOOK XIII.,
3253,BOOK XIII.,Minerva then disguised Ulysses beyond all possible            429
3254,BOOK XIII.,"recognition, and the two separated--she going to Sparta,"

3284,BOOK XIV.,
3285,BOOK XIV.,"On this he brought him inside, threw some brushwood on         48"

3296,BOOK XIV.,"said the swineherd, ""a dish of servant's pork; the fuller"

3316,BOOK XIV.,"""My friend,"" said Eumæus, ""say not another word. You          165"

3329,BOOK XIV.,"to Libya; how on the voyage thither, after leaving Crete,"
3330,BOOK XIV.,the ship was wrecked and he was cast on the coast of
3331,BOOK XIV.,"Thesprotia. ""Here it was,"" he continued, ""that I heard"
3332,BOOK XIV.,"of Ulysses from King Pheidon, who was expecting him"
3333,BOOK XIV.,"back daily from Dodona, where he had been to consult"

3335,BOOK XIV.,"immediately, but there was a ship bound for Dulichium,"
3336,BOOK XIV.,and the king sent me on board it before Ulysses returned
3337,BOOK XIV.,from Dodona. The sailors on this ship resolved to sell me
3338,BOOK XIV.,"as a slave, and bound me; but they landed on the coast of"

3346,BOOK XIV.,
3347,BOOK XIV.,"Ulysses tried still further to convince him, but it was       390"

3349,BOOK XIV.,"the pigs that had been out feeding, and Eumæus told them"
3350,BOOK XIV.,"to kill the best pig they had, and get supper ready,"
3351,BOOK XIV.,which they accordingly did. He was a good man and mindful
3352,BOOK XIV.,"of his duties to the gods, so when the pig was killed"
3353,BOOK XIV.,he threw some of its bristles into the fire and prayed
3354,BOOK XIV.,heaven for the return of Ulysses. Then they supped and
3355,BOOK XIV.,went to bed.

3357,BOOK XIV.,"Now it was a wild rough night, and after they had lain        457"
3358,BOOK XIV.,"down, Ulysses, fearing that he might be cold, told"
3359,BOOK XIV.,another lying story of an adventure he had had at Troy
3360,BOOK XIV.,"in company with Ulysses, by means of which Eumæus was"
3361,BOOK XIV.,induced to cover him over with a spare cloak of his
3362,BOOK XIV.,own. Then the swineherd went out to pass the night with
3363,BOOK XIV.,the pigs--and Ulysses was pleased at seeing how well
3364,BOOK XIV.,"he looked after his property, though he believed his"
3365,BOOK XIV.,master to be absent. First he slung his sword over his
3366,BOOK XIV.,"shoulders, and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind;"
3367,BOOK XIV.,"he also took the skin of a well-fed goat, and a javelin"
3368,BOOK XIV.,in case of attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he
3369,BOOK XIV.,went to his rest where the pigs were camped under an
3370,BOOK XIV.,overhanging rock that sheltered them from the North Wind.

3380,BOOK XV.,
3381,BOOK XV.,
3382,BOOK XV.,Minerva now went to Lacedæmon and found Telemachus and
3383,BOOK XV.,Pisistratus fast asleep. She appeared to Telemachus in
3384,BOOK XV.,"a dream, and told him that he was to return at once to"
3385,BOOK XV.,"Ithaca, for his mother was about to marry Eurymachus, and"
3386,BOOK XV.,would probably go off with some of his property. She also      17
3387,BOOK XV.,told him how the suitors were lying in wait for him in
3388,BOOK XV.,the straits between Ithaca and Samos. She said that as
3389,BOOK XV.,soon as he reached Ithaca he was to leave the ship before      29
3390,BOOK XV.,"sending it on to the town, and go to the swineherd's hut."
3391,BOOK XV.,"""Sleep there,"" she said, ""and in the morning send the"
3392,BOOK XV.,"swineherd to tell Penelope that you have returned safely."""
3393,BOOK XV.,
3394,BOOK XV.,Then she went away and Telemachus woke up. He kicked           43
3395,BOOK XV.,"Pisistratus to wake him, and said that they must start at"
3396,BOOK XV.,once. Pisistratus answered that this was impossible; it
3397,BOOK XV.,"was still dark, and they must say good bye to Menelaus,"
3398,BOOK XV.,"who, if Telemachus would only wait, would be sure to give"
3399,BOOK XV.,them a present.
3400,BOOK XV.,
3401,BOOK XV.,"At break of day, seeing Menelaus up and about, Telemachus      56"
3402,BOOK XV.,"flung on his shirt and cloak, and told him that they must"
3403,BOOK XV.,go.
3404,BOOK XV.,
3405,BOOK XV.,"Menelaus said he would not detain them, but on the score       67"
3406,BOOK XV.,"alike of propriety and economy, they must have something"
3407,BOOK XV.,"to eat before starting, and also receive the presents"
3408,BOOK XV.,"that were waiting Telemachus's acceptance. ""I will tell"
3409,BOOK XV.,"the servants,"" said he, ""to get something ready for you"
3410,BOOK XV.,"of what there may be in the house, and if you would like"
3411,BOOK XV.,"to make a tour of the principal cities of the Peloponese,"
3412,BOOK XV.,I will conduct you. No one will send us away empty
3413,BOOK XV.,"handed. Every one will give us something."""
3414,BOOK XV.,
3415,BOOK XV.,"But Telemachus said he must start at once, for he had          86"
3416,BOOK XV.,left property behind him that was insecurely guarded.
3417,BOOK XV.,
3418,BOOK XV.,When Menelaus heard this he told his wife and servants to      92
3419,BOOK XV.,"get dinner ready at once. Eteoneus, who lived at no great"
3420,BOOK XV.,"distance, now came up, and Menelaus told him to light the"
3421,BOOK XV.,fire and begin cooking; and he did as he was told.
3422,BOOK XV.,
3423,BOOK XV.,Menelaus then went down into his store room together with      99
3424,BOOK XV.,"Megapenthes, and brought up a double cup and a silver"
3425,BOOK XV.,"mixing bowl, while Helen fetched a dress of wondrous          125"
3426,BOOK XV.,"beauty, the work of her own hands. Menelaus presented the"
3427,BOOK XV.,"cup and mixing bowl, and then Helen said, ""Take this, my"
3428,BOOK XV.,"son, as a keepsake from the hand of Helen, and let your"
3429,BOOK XV.,bride wear it on her wedding day. Till then let your dear
3430,BOOK XV.,mother keep it for you. Thus may you go on your way with
3431,BOOK XV.,"a light heart."""
3432,BOOK XV.,
3433,BOOK XV.,Telemachus thanked her; Pisistratus stowed the presents       130
3434,BOOK XV.,"in the chariot, and they all sat down to dinner. Eteoneus"
3435,BOOK XV.,"carved, and Megapenthes served round the wine. When they"
3436,BOOK XV.,had done eating the two young men prepared to set out.
3437,BOOK XV.,
3438,BOOK XV.,"As they were on the point of starting, an eagle flew upon     160"
3439,BOOK XV.,"their right hand, with a goose in its talons which it had"
3440,BOOK XV.,carried off from the farm yard. This omen was so good
3441,BOOK XV.,"that every one was delighted to see it, and Pisistratus"
3442,BOOK XV.,"said, ""Say, king Menelaus, is the omen for us or for"
3443,BOOK XV.,"yourself?"""
3444,BOOK XV.,
3445,BOOK XV.,"Menelaus was in doubt how to answer, but Helen said that      169"
3446,BOOK XV.,as the eagle had come from a mountain and seized the
3447,BOOK XV.,"goose, so Ulysses should return and take vengeance on the"
3448,BOOK XV.,"suitors. Telemachus said he only hoped it might prove so,"
3449,BOOK XV.,and the pair then drove on. They reached Pylos on the
3450,BOOK XV.,"following day, and Telemachus urged Pisistratus to drive      199"
3451,BOOK XV.,"him straight to his ship, for fear Nestor should detain"
3452,BOOK XV.,him if he went to his house.
3453,BOOK XV.,
3454,BOOK XV.,"""I know,"" said Pisistratus, ""how obstinate he is. He          211"
3455,BOOK XV.,"would come down to your ship, if he knew you were there,"
3456,BOOK XV.,and would never go back without you. But he will be very
3457,BOOK XV.,"angry."" He then drove to the ship, and Telemachus told"
3458,BOOK XV.,the crew to get her under way as fast as they could.
3459,BOOK XV.,
3460,BOOK XV.,Now as he was attending to every thing and sacrificing        222
3461,BOOK XV.,"to Minerva, there came to him a man of the race of"
3462,BOOK XV.,Melampus who was flying from Argos because he had killed
3463,BOOK XV.,a man. His name was Theoclymenus and he came of an old
3464,BOOK XV.,"and highly honourable family, his father and grandfather"
3465,BOOK XV.,having been celebrated prophets and divines. He besought
3466,BOOK XV.,Telemachus to take him to Ithaca and thus save him from
3467,BOOK XV.,"enemies who were in pursuit. Telemachus consented, took"
3468,BOOK XV.,"Theoclymenus on board, and laid his spear down on the"
3469,BOOK XV.,deck.
3470,BOOK XV.,
3471,BOOK XV.,"Then they sailed away, and next day they got among the        297"
3472,BOOK XV.,"flying islands,[26] whereon Telemachus wondered whether"
3473,BOOK XV.,he should be taken or should escape.
3474,BOOK XV.,
3475,BOOK XV.,"All this time Ulysses was in the hut with Eumæus, and         301"
3476,BOOK XV.,after supper Ulysses said he should like to go down to
3477,BOOK XV.,"the town next day, and see if the suitors would take him"
3478,BOOK XV.,into their service. Eumæus at once explained to him that
3479,BOOK XV.,"any such idea was out of the question. ""You do not know,"""
3480,BOOK XV.,"he said, ""what men these suitors are; their insolence"
3481,BOOK XV.,reaches heaven; the young men who wait on them have good
3482,BOOK XV.,looking faces and well kempt heads; the tables are always
3483,BOOK XV.,clean and loaded with abundance. The suitors would be the
3484,BOOK XV.,"death of you; stay here, then, where you are in nobody's"
3485,BOOK XV.,"way, till Telemachus returns from Pylos."""
3486,BOOK XV.,
3487,BOOK XV.,"Ulysses thanked Eumæus for his information, and then          340"
3488,BOOK XV.,began to ask whether his father and mother were still
3489,BOOK XV.,"living; he was told that Anticlea was dead,[27] and that"
3490,BOOK XV.,"Laertes, though still alive, would be glad to follow her."
3491,BOOK XV.,"Eumæus said he had been brought up in their service, and"
3492,BOOK XV.,"was better off formerly, for there was no getting a good"
3493,BOOK XV.,"word out of his mistress now, inasmuch as the suitors had"
3494,BOOK XV.,"turned the house upside down. ""Servants,"" he said, ""like"
3495,BOOK XV.,to have a talk with their mistress and hear things from
3496,BOOK XV.,"her own lips; they like being told to eat and drink, and"
3497,BOOK XV.,being allowed to take something back with them into the
3498,BOOK XV.,country. This is what will keep servants cheerful and
3499,BOOK XV.,"contented."""
3500,BOOK XV.,
3501,BOOK XV.,"On being further questioned by Ulysses, Eumæus told           380"
3502,BOOK XV.,how he had been kidnapped as a child by some Phœnician
3503,BOOK XV.,traders who had seduced his nurse (also a Phœnician) and
3504,BOOK XV.,"persuaded her to go away with them, and bring him with"
3505,BOOK XV.,her.

3510,BOOK XV.,"land between them, and my father was king over them both."
3511,BOOK XV.,"A few days after my nurse had kidnapped me, and while we"
3512,BOOK XV.,"were on our voyage, Diana killed her, and she was flung"

3515,BOOK XV.,
3516,BOOK XV.,Ulysses and Eumæus spent the greater part of the night        493
3517,BOOK XV.,"talking with one another, and at dawn Telemachus's crew"
3518,BOOK XV.,"drew near to land, furled their sails and rowed into the"
3519,BOOK XV.,"harbour. There they threw out their mooring stones, made"
3520,BOOK XV.,"their ship fast, landed, and ate their dinner on the"
3521,BOOK XV.,"shore. When they had done, Telemachus said, ""Now take"
3522,BOOK XV.,the ship on to the city; I will go to look after my farm
3523,BOOK XV.,and will come down in the evening. Tomorrow morning I
3524,BOOK XV.,will give you all a hearty meal to reward you for your
3525,BOOK XV.,"trouble."""
3526,BOOK XV.,
3527,BOOK XV.,"""But what,"" said Theoclymenus, ""is to become of me? To        508"

3529,BOOK XV.,
3530,BOOK XV.,"""At any other time,"" answered Telemachus, ""I should take      512"
3531,BOOK XV.,"you to my own house, but you would not find it convenient"
3532,BOOK XV.,"now, for I shall not be there, and my mother will not"
3533,BOOK XV.,see you. I shall therefore send you to the house of
3534,BOOK XV.,"Eurymachus, who is one of the first men we have, and is"
3535,BOOK XV.,"most eager in his suit for my mother's hand."""
3536,BOOK XV.,
3537,BOOK XV.,"As he spoke a hawk flew on Telemachus's right hand, with      525"
3538,BOOK XV.,a dove whose feathers it was plucking while it flew.
3539,BOOK XV.,Theoclymenus assured Telemachus that this was an omen
3540,BOOK XV.,which boded most happily for the prosperity of his house.
3541,BOOK XV.,It was then settled that Theoclymenus should go to the
3542,BOOK XV.,house of Piræus the son of Clytius.
3543,BOOK XV.,
3544,BOOK XV.,The crew now loosed the ship from her moorings and went       547

3575,BOOK XVI.,"suppliant he was much displeased. ""I am as yet too"

3583,BOOK XVI.,Ulysses expressed his surprise and indignation about the       90
3584,BOOK XVI.,"suitors, whereon Telemachus explained still further,"
3585,BOOK XVI.,and wound up by telling Eumæus to go at once and inform
3586,BOOK XVI.,Penelope of his return. Eumæus asked if he should turn a
3587,BOOK XVI.,"little out of his way and tell Laertes, but Telemachus"
3588,BOOK XVI.,said he was not to do so. Penelope would send him word
3589,BOOK XVI.,all in due course.
3590,BOOK XVI.,
3591,BOOK XVI.,As soon as Eumæus was gone Minerva came to the hut.           157
3592,BOOK XVI.,"Ulysses knew her, and so did the dogs, for they went"
3593,BOOK XVI.,"whining away to the other end of the yards, but"
3594,BOOK XVI.,Telemachus did not see her. She made a sign to Ulysses
3595,BOOK XVI.,"that he was to come outside, and when he had done so she"
3596,BOOK XVI.,told him he was to reveal himself to his son--whereon
3597,BOOK XVI.,"she struck him with her wand, endowed him with a noble"
3598,BOOK XVI.,"presence, and clothed him in goodly raiment."
3599,BOOK XVI.,
3600,BOOK XVI.,Then he went back into the hut and told his son who he        178

3602,BOOK XVI.,"At last, however, when he was convinced, the pair flung"
3603,BOOK XVI.,"their arms about each other's necks, and wept like eagles"

3620,BOOK XVI.,"twenty from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca."
3621,BOOK XVI.,

3654,BOOK XVI.,and Antinous said that as Telemachus had escaped them
3655,BOOK XVI.,"in spite of their great vigilance, they must kill him,"
3656,BOOK XVI.,either at the farm or as he was coming thence. Otherwise
3657,BOOK XVI.,"he would expose their plot, and they would have the"

3668,BOOK XVI.,was more pleasing to Penelope than that of any of the
3669,BOOK XVI.,"other suitors; ""I will only consent to kill Telemachus,"""
3670,BOOK XVI.,"said he, ""if the gods give us their approval. It is a"
3671,BOOK XVI.,serious thing to kill a man who is of royal race. If

3681,BOOK XVI.,his father Eupeithes.

3715,BOOK XVII.,"and Ulysses, who is maltreated by the suitors_."
3716,BOOK XVII.,
3717,BOOK XVII.,
3718,BOOK XVII.,When morning came Telemachus told Eumæus that he would
3719,BOOK XVII.,"now go to the town and show himself to his mother, who"
3720,BOOK XVII.,would never be comforted till she saw him with her own
3721,BOOK XVII.,"eyes. ""As for this miserable stranger,"" he continued,"
3722,BOOK XVII.,"""take him to the town, that he may beg there and get what"
3723,BOOK XVII.,"he can; if this does not please him, so much the worse"
3724,BOOK XVII.,"for him, but I like to say what I mean."""
3725,BOOK XVII.,
3726,BOOK XVII.,"Ulysses said he should be glad to go, for a beggar could       16"
3727,BOOK XVII.,do much better in town than country; but he must warm
3728,BOOK XVII.,"himself first, and wait till the sun had got some heat in"
3729,BOOK XVII.,"it; his clothes were very bad, and he should perish with"
3730,BOOK XVII.,"cold, for the town was some way off."
3731,BOOK XVII.,
3732,BOOK XVII.,"Telemachus then left, and when he reached the house he         26"
3733,BOOK XVII.,"set his spear against a strong bearing post, crossed the"
3734,BOOK XVII.,stone pavement and went inside. He found Euryclea putting
3735,BOOK XVII.,the sheep skins on to the seats. She and all the other
3736,BOOK XVII.,"maids ran up to him as soon as they saw him, and kissed"
3737,BOOK XVII.,him on the head and shoulders. Then Penelope came weeping
3738,BOOK XVII.,"from her room, embraced him, and told him to tell her all"
3739,BOOK XVII.,that he had seen.
3740,BOOK XVII.,
3741,BOOK XVII.,Telemachus bade her go back to her room and pray to            45
3742,BOOK XVII.,"Minerva that they might be revenged on the suitors. ""I"
3743,BOOK XVII.,"must go,"" said he, ""to the place of assembly, to look"
3744,BOOK XVII.,"after a guest whom I have brought with me, and whom I"
3745,BOOK XVII.,"have left with Piræus."""
3746,BOOK XVII.,
3747,BOOK XVII.,"Penelope did as her son had said, while Telemachus went        61"
3748,BOOK XVII.,"to the place of assembly, and his two dogs with him. The"
3749,BOOK XVII.,"suitors, who had not yet gone to the house of Ulysses for"
3750,BOOK XVII.,"the day, gathered round him, and made him fair speeches,"
3751,BOOK XVII.,but he knew their falsehood and went to sit with his
3752,BOOK XVII.,"old friends Mentor, Antiphus and Halitherses. Presently"
3753,BOOK XVII.,"Piræus came up, bringing Theoclymenus with him, and said,"
3754,BOOK XVII.,"""I wish you would send some of your women to my house to"
3755,BOOK XVII.,"take away the presents that Menelaus gave you."""
3756,BOOK XVII.,
3757,BOOK XVII.,Telemachus said he did not know what might happen; if          77
3758,BOOK XVII.,"the suitors killed him, he had rather Piræus kept the"
3759,BOOK XVII.,"presents than that the suitors should have them. If, on"
3760,BOOK XVII.,"the other hand, he killed the suitors he should be much"
3761,BOOK XVII.,obliged if Piræus would let him have the presents.
3762,BOOK XVII.,
3763,BOOK XVII.,"Then he took Theoclymenus to his own house, where they         84"
3764,BOOK XVII.,"had a bath, and refreshments were set before them."
3765,BOOK XVII.,"Penelope sat near them, spinning, while they were at"
3766,BOOK XVII.,"table, and then said she should go up stairs and lie down"
3767,BOOK XVII.,on that couch which she had never ceased to water with
3768,BOOK XVII.,"her tears from the day her husband left her. ""But you had"
3769,BOOK XVII.,"not the patience,"" she added, ""to tell me, before the"
3770,BOOK XVII.,"suitors came, whether you had been able to hear anything"
3771,BOOK XVII.,"about your father."""
3772,BOOK XVII.,
3773,BOOK XVII.,"Telemachus told her how good Nestor had been to him,          107"
3774,BOOK XVII.,"and how he had sent him on to Menelaus, who had assured"
3775,BOOK XVII.,"him that Ulysses was still alive, but was detained by"
3776,BOOK XVII.,"Calypso, from whom he could not get away for want of a"
3777,BOOK XVII.,"ship. Penelope was very much agitated, but Theoclymenus"
3778,BOOK XVII.,reassured her by telling her about the omen which had
3779,BOOK XVII.,greeted Telemachus on his return to Ithaca.
3780,BOOK XVII.,
3781,BOOK XVII.,"While they were thus conversing, the suitors were             166"
3782,BOOK XVII.,playing at quoits and aiming javelins at a mark on the
3783,BOOK XVII.,level ground in front of Ulysses' house. But when it
3784,BOOK XVII.,was near dinner time and the flocks were coming in from
3785,BOOK XVII.,all the country round with their shepherds as usual [to
3786,BOOK XVII.,"be milked], Medon, who was a great favourite with the"
3787,BOOK XVII.,"suitors, called them to come in and set about getting"
3788,BOOK XVII.,their dinner ready. They therefore came in and began to
3789,BOOK XVII.,"butcher some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer."
3790,BOOK XVII.,
3791,BOOK XVII.,Meanwhile Eumæus told Ulysses that it was time to make        182
3792,BOOK XVII.,"a start, for the day was well up and if he waited till"
3793,BOOK XVII.,"afternoon he would find the cold more severe. ""At any"
3794,BOOK XVII.,"rate,"" said Ulysses, ""let me have a staff if you have"
3795,BOOK XVII.,"one, for the path is rugged."" Eumæus gave him one, and"
3796,BOOK XVII.,they set out along the steep path leading to the town.
3797,BOOK XVII.,When they were nearly there they came to the fountain
3798,BOOK XVII.,"which Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor had made, and from"
3799,BOOK XVII.,which the people drew their water; here they fell in with
3800,BOOK XVII.,"Melantheus[29] son of Dolius, who was bringing goats for"
3801,BOOK XVII.,"the suitors' dinner, he and his two under shepherds."
3802,BOOK XVII.,
3803,BOOK XVII.,Melanthius heaped all kinds of insult on Ulysses and          215
3804,BOOK XVII.,"Eumæus, and tried to kick Ulysses off the path, but"
3805,BOOK XVII.,"could not do so. Ulysses restrained himself, and prayed"
3806,BOOK XVII.,"to the nymphs, whereon Melanthius said he would put him"
3807,BOOK XVII.,on board ship and sell him in some foreign country. He
3808,BOOK XVII.,"then hurried on, leaving the swineherd and his master to"
3809,BOOK XVII.,follow at their own pace.
3810,BOOK XVII.,
3811,BOOK XVII.,When they got near the house they could hear the sound of     260
3812,BOOK XVII.,"Phemius's lyre, and his voice as he sang to the suitors."
3813,BOOK XVII.,They could also smell the savour of roast meats.[30]
3814,BOOK XVII.,"Eumæus said that he would go in first, but that Ulysses"
3815,BOOK XVII.,"had better follow him soon, for if he was seen standing"
3816,BOOK XVII.,about in the outer court people might throw things at him.
3817,BOOK XVII.,
3818,BOOK XVII.,As they were thus talking the old hound Argus who was         290
3819,BOOK XVII.,"lying on the dunghill, very full of fleas, caught sight"
3820,BOOK XVII.,"of Ulysses, recognised him, wagged his tail, and tried to"
3821,BOOK XVII.,"come to him, but could not do so. Thereon Ulysses wiped"
3822,BOOK XVII.,"a tear from his eyes, and asked Eumæus whether the dog"
3823,BOOK XVII.,"was of any use, or whether he was kept only for his good"
3824,BOOK XVII.,"looks. Eumæus said what a noble hound Argus had been, but"
3825,BOOK XVII.,"the dog, having seen his master, died just as Eumæus went"
3826,BOOK XVII.,inside the house.
3827,BOOK XVII.,
3828,BOOK XVII.,Telemachus saw him enter and beckoned him to a seat           328
3829,BOOK XVII.,"at his own table. Ulysses followed him shortly, and"
3830,BOOK XVII.,"sat down on the floor of ash wood inside the door way,"
3831,BOOK XVII.,leaning against a bearing-post of well-squared Cyprus
3832,BOOK XVII.,"wood. Telemachus noted him and said to Eumæus, ""Take the"
3833,BOOK XVII.,"stranger this handful of bread and meat, tell him also to"
3834,BOOK XVII.,"go round and beg from the others, for a beggar must not"
3835,BOOK XVII.,"be shamefaced."" Eumæus gave him both the message and the"
3836,BOOK XVII.,bread and meat.
3837,BOOK XVII.,
3838,BOOK XVII.,"Then Ulysses began to go round begging, for he wanted to      360"
3839,BOOK XVII.,"exploit the suitors. He went from left to right, and some"
3840,BOOK XVII.,took compassion on him while others begun asking who
3841,BOOK XVII.,he might be; Melanthius then said that he had come with
3842,BOOK XVII.,"the swineherd. Antinous, therefore, asked Eumæus what he"
3843,BOOK XVII.,meant by bringing such a man to plague them.
3844,BOOK XVII.,
3845,BOOK XVII.,"""I did not ask him to come,"" answered Eumæus. ""Who was        350"
3846,BOOK XVII.,"likely to ask a man of that sort? One would ask a divine,"
3847,BOOK XVII.,"a physician, a carpenter, or a bard. You are always"
3848,BOOK XVII.,"hardest of all the suitors on Ulysses' servants, and"
3849,BOOK XVII.,"especially upon me, but I do not care so long as I have"
3850,BOOK XVII.,"Penelope and Telemachus on my side."""
3851,BOOK XVII.,
3852,BOOK XVII.,"""Hush,"" said Telemachus, ""Antinous has the bitterest          392"
3853,BOOK XVII.,"tongue of them all, and he makes the others worse."" Then"
3854,BOOK XVII.,"he turned towards Antinous and said, ""Give him something:"
3855,BOOK XVII.,I do not grudge it. Never mind my mother or any of the
3856,BOOK XVII.,servants--not you--but you are fonder of eating than of
3857,BOOK XVII.,"giving."""
3858,BOOK XVII.,
3859,BOOK XVII.,"Antinous said, ""You are a swaggering upstart; if all the      405"
3860,BOOK XVII.,"suitors will give him as much as I will, he will not come"
3861,BOOK XVII.,"near the house again this three months."""
3862,BOOK XVII.,
3863,BOOK XVII.,As he spoke he menaced Ulysses with the footstool             409
3864,BOOK XVII.,from under his table. The other suitors all gave him
3865,BOOK XVII.,"something; and he was about to leave, when he determined"
3866,BOOK XVII.,to again beg from Antinous and trumped him up a story of
3867,BOOK XVII.,the misfortunes that had befallen him in Egypt.
3868,BOOK XVII.,
3869,BOOK XVII.,"""Get out,"" said Antinous, ""into the open part of the          445"
3870,BOOK XVII.,"court,[31] and away from my table, or I will give you"
3871,BOOK XVII.,"Egypt over again."""
3872,BOOK XVII.,
3873,BOOK XVII.,"Ulysses drew back, and said, ""Your looks are better than      453"
3874,BOOK XVII.,your understanding. I can see that if you were in your
3875,BOOK XVII.,own house you would not spare a poor man so much as a
3876,BOOK XVII.,"pinch of salt."""
3877,BOOK XVII.,
3878,BOOK XVII.,"Antinous scowled at him. ""Take that,"" he cried, ""and be       458"
3879,BOOK XVII.,"off out of the court."" As he spoke he threw a footstool"
3880,BOOK XVII.,"at him which hit him on the right shoulder, but Ulysses"
3881,BOOK XVII.,"stood firm as a rock, and prayed that if there was a god,"
3882,BOOK XVII.,"or an avenger of beggars, Antinous might be a corpse"
3883,BOOK XVII.,before he was a bridegroom.
3884,BOOK XVII.,
3885,BOOK XVII.,"""Have a care,"" replied Antinous, ""and hold your peace, or     477"
3886,BOOK XVII.,"we will flay you alive."""
3887,BOOK XVII.,
3888,BOOK XVII.,"The others reproved Antinous. ""You did ill,"" they said,       481"
3889,BOOK XVII.,"""to strike the man. Who knows but he may be one of the"
3890,BOOK XVII.,"gods who go about the world in disguise to redress wrong,"
3891,BOOK XVII.,"and chastise the insolence of mankind?"""
3892,BOOK XVII.,
3893,BOOK XVII.,Penelope from her room upstairs heard what had been going     491
3894,BOOK XVII.,"on, and spoke with her women bitterly about the suitors."
3895,BOOK XVII.,The housekeeper Eurynome answered that if her prayers
3896,BOOK XVII.,"were heard, not a single one of them would live till"
3897,BOOK XVII.,"morning. ""Nurse,"" replied Penelope, ""I hate them all,"
3898,BOOK XVII.,"but Antinous is the worst."" Then she sent for Eumæus and"
3899,BOOK XVII.,"said, ""Tell the stranger that I want to see him; he looks"
3900,BOOK XVII.,"like a man who has travelled, and he may have seen or"
3901,BOOK XVII.,"heard something of Ulysses."""

3903,BOOK XVII.,"""He has been three days and three nights at my hut,           515"

3905,BOOK XVII.,could not have given me better entertainment. He told me
3906,BOOK XVII.,that Ulysses was among the Thesprotians and would return
3907,BOOK XVII.,"shortly, bringing much treasure with him."""
3908,BOOK XVII.,

3913,BOOK XVII.,
3914,BOOK XVII.,"Telemachus, who was down below, gave a great sneeze as        541"
3915,BOOK XVII.,"she spoke, which echoed over the whole house. Penelope"
3916,BOOK XVII.,"explained to Eumæus that this was a most favourable omen,"
3917,BOOK XVII.,and added that if she was satisfied of the truth of what
3918,BOOK XVII.,the stranger told her she would give him a shirt and
3919,BOOK XVII.,cloak.
3920,BOOK XVII.,
3921,BOOK XVII.,"Eumæus gave Penelope's message to Ulysses, but he feared      551"

3924,BOOK XVII.,"""Then,"" he said, ""let her set me down in a warm seat by"
3925,BOOK XVII.,"the fire, and I will tell her about her husband; for my"

3927,BOOK XVII.,"your's was the first house I came to."""
3928,BOOK XVII.,
3929,BOOK XVII.,"Penelope was displeased at his delay, and asked Eumæus        574"
3930,BOOK XVII.,"whether his fears were reasonable, or whether it was only"
3931,BOOK XVII.,that he was shamefaced. Eumæus explained that he was
3932,BOOK XVII.,"quite reasonable, whereon Penelope was satisfied; he then"
3933,BOOK XVII.,"went back to where the suitors were, and told Telemachus"
3934,BOOK XVII.,that he would return to his pigs.
3935,BOOK XVII.,
3936,BOOK XVII.,Telemachus said that he had better get something to eat       598
3937,BOOK XVII.,"first, and was to come back to the town on the following"

3952,BOOK XVIII.,"Now there came a common tramp to Ulysses' house,"
3953,BOOK XVIII.,begging--a great hulking fellow with no stay in

3955,BOOK XVIII.,because he would run errands for any one who would send
3956,BOOK XVIII.,"him on them. This man began to threaten Ulysses, and said"
3957,BOOK XVIII.,the suitors had urged him to turn him away from the house.
3958,BOOK XVIII.,
3959,BOOK XVIII.,"Ulysses said there was room enough for both of them, and      14"
3960,BOOK XVIII.,that it should be a case of live-and-let-live between
3961,BOOK XVIII.,"them. ""If, however,"" he continued, ""it comes to blows, I"

3965,BOOK XVIII.,
3966,BOOK XVIII.,"Irus retorted angrily, and Antinous, hearing them             34"

3968,BOOK XVIII.,"stranger were about to have a fight. ""It is the finest"
3969,BOOK XVIII.,"piece of sport,"" he said, ""that heaven ever sent into"
3970,BOOK XVIII.,this house. We are to have goat's paunches stuffed with

3977,BOOK XVIII.,"to it, and the fight began.[32] Ulysses forthwith nearly"
3978,BOOK XVIII.,killed Irus and dragged him by the heels into the outer
3979,BOOK XVIII.,"court, where he put his staff in his hand and propped him"
3980,BOOK XVIII.,up against the wall more dead than alive. Antinous then
3981,BOOK XVIII.,"gave Ulysses a great goat's paunch, and Amphinomus drank"
3982,BOOK XVIII.,his health.
3983,BOOK XVIII.,
3984,BOOK XVIII.,Ulysses made Amphinomus a very grave and impressive           124
3985,BOOK XVIII.,"speech, warning him to leave the house, inasmuch as"
3986,BOOK XVIII.,"Ulysses would return shortly. ""You seem,"" said he, ""to"
3987,BOOK XVIII.,"be a man of good understanding, as indeed you may well"
3988,BOOK XVIII.,"be, seeing whose son you are. I have heard your father"
3989,BOOK XVIII.,"well spoken of; he is Nisus of Dulichium, a man both"
3990,BOOK XVIII.,brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son and you
3991,BOOK XVIII.,"seem to be a considerable person; listen, therefore, and"
3992,BOOK XVIII.,take heed to what I am saying. Man is the vainest of all
3993,BOOK XVIII.,creatures that live and move upon the earth: as long as
3994,BOOK XVIII.,heaven vouchsafes him health and strength he thinks that
3995,BOOK XVIII.,"he shall come to no harm hereafter, and even when the"
3996,BOOK XVIII.,"blessed gods bring sorrow upon him, he bears it as he"
3997,BOOK XVIII.,"needs must and makes the best of it, for God Almighty"
3998,BOOK XVIII.,gives men their daily minds day by day. I know all about
3999,BOOK XVIII.,"it, for I was a rich man once, and did much wrong in the"
4000,BOOK XVIII.,stubbornness of my pride and in the confidence that my
4001,BOOK XVIII.,father and my brothers would support me; therefore let
4002,BOOK XVIII.,"a man fear God in all things always, and take the good"
4003,BOOK XVIII.,"that heaven may see fit to send him without vainglory."""

4007,BOOK XVIII.,Minerva then put it in Penelope's mind to get some            158

4023,BOOK XVIII.,"her with the most dazzling beauty, washing her face with"
4024,BOOK XVIII.,the ambrosial loveliness which Venus wears when she goes
4025,BOOK XVIII.,"out dancing with the Graces, and giving her a statelier"

4031,BOOK XVIII.,
4032,BOOK XVIII.,"She then went down stairs, and the suitors were dazzled       206"

4034,BOOK XVIII.,for having allowed the fight to take place. Telemachus
4035,BOOK XVIII.,"admitted his fault, but pleaded the extreme difficulty"

4038,BOOK XVIII.,
4039,BOOK XVIII.,Enrymachus broke in upon their conversation by telling        243
4040,BOOK XVIII.,Penelope how very beautiful she was; and Penelope

4043,BOOK XVIII.,"added, ""I have another great sorrow--you suitors are not"
4044,BOOK XVIII.,wooing me in the usual way. When men are suing for the
4045,BOOK XVIII.,"hand of one who they think will make them a good wife,"
4046,BOOK XVIII.,they generally bring oxen and sheep for her relations to
4047,BOOK XVIII.,"feast upon, and make rich presents to the lady herself,"
4048,BOOK XVIII.,"instead of sponging upon other people's property."""
4049,BOOK XVIII.,
4050,BOOK XVIII.,"When Ulysses heard her say this, he was delighted at          281"
4051,BOOK XVIII.,seeing his wife trying to get presents out of the

4053,BOOK XVIII.,
4054,BOOK XVIII.,"Then Antinous said, ""Penelope, take all the presents          284"

4066,BOOK XVIII.,at him. She was daughter to Dolius but Penelope had
4067,BOOK XVIII.,"brought her up from childhood, and used to give her toys;"
4068,BOOK XVIII.,"she showed no consideration, however, for Penelope's"
4069,BOOK XVIII.,"sorrows, but misconducted herself with Eurymachus. ""Are"
4070,BOOK XVIII.,"you drunk?"" she said to Ulysses, ""or are you always like"
4071,BOOK XVIII.,"this?"""
4072,BOOK XVIII.,
4073,BOOK XVIII.,"Ulysses scowled at her, and said he would tell                337"
4074,BOOK XVIII.,"Telemachus, who would have her cut up into mincemeat."
4075,BOOK XVIII.,"The women, therefore, were frightened and went away, so"
4076,BOOK XVIII.,Ulysses was left holding up the flaming torches--looking
4077,BOOK XVIII.,upon all the suitors and brooding over his revenge.
4078,BOOK XVIII.,
4079,BOOK XVIII.,"Presently Eurymachus began to jeer at him, and taunt          346"
4080,BOOK XVIII.,him by saying he preferred begging to working. Ulysses
4081,BOOK XVIII.,"answered, ""If you and I, Eurymachus, were matched one"
4082,BOOK XVIII.,"against the other in early summer, when the days are"
4083,BOOK XVIII.,"at their longest--give us each a good scythe, and see"
4084,BOOK XVIII.,whether you or I will mow the stronger or fast the
4085,BOOK XVIII.,"longer, from dawn till dark when the mowing grass is"
4086,BOOK XVIII.,about. Or let us be in a four acre field with a couple
4087,BOOK XVIII.,"of tawny full fed oxen each, and see which of us can"
4088,BOOK XVIII.,"drive the straighter furrow. Again, let war break out"
4089,BOOK XVIII.,this day--give me armour and you will find me fighting
4090,BOOK XVIII.,"among the foremost. You are insolent and cruel, and think"
4091,BOOK XVIII.,"yourself a great man because you live in a little world,"
4092,BOOK XVIII.,"and that a bad one."""
4093,BOOK XVIII.,
4094,BOOK XVIII.,"Eurymachus was furious, and seized a stool; but Ulysses       394"
4095,BOOK XVIII.,"sat down by the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, for"
4096,BOOK XVIII.,he was afraid; the stool hit the cupbearer and knocked
4097,BOOK XVIII.,"him down, whereon there was a general uproar, amid which"
4098,BOOK XVIII.,"Telemachus said that he would compel no man, but he"
4099,BOOK XVIII.,thought it would be better if they would all go home to
4100,BOOK XVIII.,"bed. To this they assented, and shortly afterwards left"

4112,BOOK XIX.,
4113,BOOK XIX.,"Ulysses and Telemachus were left alone in the cloister,"
4114,BOOK XIX.,"and Ulysses said, ""We must take the armour down from the"

4117,BOOK XIX.,
4118,BOOK XIX.,"Telemachus called Euryclea, and bade her shut the women        15"

4120,BOOK XIX.,"down into the store room. ""Who,"" asked Euryclea, ""will"
4121,BOOK XIX.,"show you a light if the women are all shut up?"" ""The"

4125,BOOK XIX.,"He and Ulysses then began removing the armour, and             31"

4130,BOOK XIX.,"with your mother and the maids."" So Telemachus crossed"
4131,BOOK XIX.,"the court and went to the room in which he always slept,"
4132,BOOK XIX.,leaving Ulysses in the cloister.
4133,BOOK XIX.,
4134,BOOK XIX.,"Penelope now came down, and they set a seat for her by         53"

4137,BOOK XIX.,and to heap fresh wood upon the braziers after they had
4138,BOOK XIX.,emptied the ashes on to the ground.[34] Melantho again
4139,BOOK XIX.,began scolding at Ulysses for stopping in the house to
4140,BOOK XIX.,"spy on the women. Penelope heard her and said, ""Bold"
4141,BOOK XIX.,"hussey, I hear you, and you shall smart for it; I have"
4142,BOOK XIX.,already told you that I wish to see the stranger and
4143,BOOK XIX.,"enquire from him about my husband. Eurynome, bring a seat"
4144,BOOK XIX.,"for him, and spread a fleece on it."""
4145,BOOK XIX.,
4146,BOOK XIX.,"Eurynome did as she was told, and when Ulysses had sat        100"
4147,BOOK XIX.,down Penelope wanted to know who he was. Ulysses implored
4148,BOOK XIX.,"her not to ask this, for it would make him weep, and she"
4149,BOOK XIX.,or the servants might then think he had been drinking.

4152,BOOK XIX.,my beauty when the Argives set out for Troy and Ulysses
4153,BOOK XIX.,"with them."" She then told about the suitors, and her"
4154,BOOK XIX.,"web, and said that she was now at the very end of her"
4155,BOOK XIX.,"resources. Her parents were urging her to marry again,"
4156,BOOK XIX.,"and so also was her son, who chafed under the heavy"
4157,BOOK XIX.,burden of expense which her long courtship had caused
4158,BOOK XIX.,"him. ""In spite of all this, however,"" she continued, ""I"
4159,BOOK XIX.,want to know who you are; for you cannot be the son of a

4161,BOOK XIX.,
4162,BOOK XIX.,"Thus pressed, Ulysses said that his name was Æthon and        164"
4163,BOOK XIX.,"that he came from Crete, where he had entertained Ulysses"
4164,BOOK XIX.,and his men for many days when they were on their way to
4165,BOOK XIX.,"Troy. Penelope wept bitterly as she listened, and it was"
4166,BOOK XIX.,all Ulysses could do to restrain his own tears--but he
4167,BOOK XIX.,"succeeded. ""I will now prove you,"" said she; ""tell me how"

4171,BOOK XIX.,"""I will tell you,"" replied Ulysses, ""as nearly as I can       220"

4173,BOOK XIX.,"wool, double lined, and it was fastened by a gold brooch"
4174,BOOK XIX.,with two catches for the pin. On the face of this there
4175,BOOK XIX.,was a device that shewed a dog holding a spotted fawn
4176,BOOK XIX.,"between its fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting"
4177,BOOK XIX.,on the ground. Every one marvelled at the way in which
4178,BOOK XIX.,these things had been done in gold--the dog looking at
4179,BOOK XIX.,"the fawn and strangling it, while the fawn was struggling     231"
4180,BOOK XIX.,"convulsively to escape. As for his shirt, it fitted him"
4181,BOOK XIX.,"like the skin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight"
4182,BOOK XIX.,to the admiration of all the women who beheld it. He had
4183,BOOK XIX.,"a servant with him, a little older than himself, whose        246"
4184,BOOK XIX.,"shoulders were hunched; he was dark, and had thick curly"
4185,BOOK XIX.,"hair. His name was Eurybates."""
4186,BOOK XIX.,
4187,BOOK XIX.,"Penelope was deeply moved. ""You shall want for nothing,""      249"

4198,BOOK XIX.,"""If you say truly,"" replied Penelope, ""you shall indeed       308"

4201,BOOK XIX.,"comfortable bed, and in the morning wash him again and"
4202,BOOK XIX.,"anoint him, that he may sit at the same table with"

4204,BOOK XIX.,"rue it, for fume as he may, he shall have no more to do"
4205,BOOK XIX.,"in this house. How indeed, Sir, can you know how much I"
4206,BOOK XIX.,surpass all other women in goodness and discretion unless
4207,BOOK XIX.,"I see that you are well clothed and fed?"""
4208,BOOK XIX.,
4209,BOOK XIX.,"""Make me no bed, Madam, said Ulysses, ""I will lie on the      336"
4210,BOOK XIX.,bare ground as I am wont to do. Nor do I like having my
4211,BOOK XIX.,feet washed. I will not allow any of your serving women

4216,BOOK XIX.,"""Stranger,"" answered Penelope, ""your sense of propriety       349"

4218,BOOK XIX.,have exactly the kind of person you describe; she was
4219,BOOK XIX.,"Ulysses' nurse from the day of his birth, and is now very"
4220,BOOK XIX.,"old and feeble, but she shall wash your feet. Euryclea,"
4221,BOOK XIX.,come and wash the stranger's feet. He is about the same
4222,BOOK XIX.,"age as your master would be."""
4223,BOOK XIX.,
4224,BOOK XIX.,"Euryclea spoke compassionately to Ulysses, and ended by       361"
4225,BOOK XIX.,saying that he was very like her master. To which Ulysses
4226,BOOK XIX.,replied that many other people had observed the likeness.
4227,BOOK XIX.,
4228,BOOK XIX.,Then the old woman got a large foot bath and put some         386
4229,BOOK XIX.,"cold water into it, adding hot water until it was the"
4230,BOOK XIX.,"right heat. As soon, however, as she got Ulysses' leg"
4231,BOOK XIX.,"in her hands, she recognised a scar on it as one which"
4232,BOOK XIX.,her master had got from being ripped by a boar when he
4233,BOOK XIX.,was hunting on Mt. Parnassus with his mother's father         394
4234,BOOK XIX.,"Autolycus, whom Mercury had endowed with the gift of"
4235,BOOK XIX.,being the most accomplished thief and perjurer in the
4236,BOOK XIX.,"whole world, for he was very fond of him. She immediately"
4237,BOOK XIX.,"dropped the leg, which made a loud noise against the side     468"
4238,BOOK XIX.,of the bath and upset all the water. Her eyes filled with
4239,BOOK XIX.,"tears, and she caught Ulysses by the beard and told him"
4240,BOOK XIX.,that she knew him.
4241,BOOK XIX.,
4242,BOOK XIX.,She looked towards Penelope to tell her; but Minerva had      476
4243,BOOK XIX.,"directed Penelope's attention elsewhere, so that she"
4244,BOOK XIX.,had observed nothing of what had been going on. Ulysses
4245,BOOK XIX.,"gripped Euryclea's throat, and swore he would kill her,"
4246,BOOK XIX.,"nurse to him though she had been, unless she kept his"
4247,BOOK XIX.,return secret--which she promised to do. She also said
4248,BOOK XIX.,"that if heaven delivered the suitors into his hands, she"
4249,BOOK XIX.,would give him a list of all the women in the house who
4250,BOOK XIX.,had misconducted themselves.
4251,BOOK XIX.,
4252,BOOK XIX.,"""You have no need,"" said Ulysses, ""I shall find that out      499"
4253,BOOK XIX.,for myself. See that you keep my counsel and leave the
4254,BOOK XIX.,"rest to heaven."""
4255,BOOK XIX.,
4256,BOOK XIX.,"Euryclea now went to fetch some more water, for the           503"
4257,BOOK XIX.,"first had been all spilt. When she had brought it, and"
4258,BOOK XIX.,"had washed Ulysses, he turned his seat round to the fire"
4259,BOOK XIX.,"to dry himself, and drew his rags over the scar that"
4260,BOOK XIX.,Penelope might not see it.
4261,BOOK XIX.,
4262,BOOK XIX.,"Then Penelope detailed her sorrows to Ulysses. Others,        508"
4263,BOOK XIX.,"she said, could sleep, but she could not do so, neither"
4264,BOOK XIX.,night nor day. She could not rest for thinking what her
4265,BOOK XIX.,duty might be. Ought she to stay where she was and stand
4266,BOOK XIX.,"guard over her son's estate, or ought she to marry one"
4267,BOOK XIX.,"of the suitors and go elsewhere? Her son, while he was        530"
4268,BOOK XIX.,"a boy, would not hear of her doing this, but now that"
4269,BOOK XIX.,he was grown up and realised the havoc that the suitors
4270,BOOK XIX.,"were making of his property, he was continually urging"
4271,BOOK XIX.,"her to go. Besides, she had had a strange dream about         538"
4272,BOOK XIX.,an eagle that had come from a mountain and swooped down
4273,BOOK XIX.,on her favourite geese as they were eating mash out of
4274,BOOK XIX.,"a tub,[35] and had killed them all. Then the eagle came"
4275,BOOK XIX.,"back and told her he was Ulysses, while the geese were"
4276,BOOK XIX.,the suitors; but when she woke the geese were still
4277,BOOK XIX.,"feeding at the mash tub. Now, what did all this mean?"
4278,BOOK XIX.,
4279,BOOK XIX.,Ulysses said it could only mean the immediate return of       554
4280,BOOK XIX.,"her husband, and his revenge upon the suitors."
4281,BOOK XIX.,
4282,BOOK XIX.,"But Penelope would not believe him. ""Dreams,"" she said,       559"
4283,BOOK XIX.,"""are very curious things. They come through two gates,"
4284,BOOK XIX.,"one of horn, and the other of ivory. Those that come"
4285,BOOK XIX.,through the gate of ivory have no significance. It is the
4286,BOOK XIX.,"others that alone are true, and my dream came through the"
4287,BOOK XIX.,"gate of ivory. Tomorrow, therefore, I shall set Ulysses'"
4288,BOOK XIX.,"bow before the suitors, and I will leave this house with"
4289,BOOK XIX.,him who can draw it most easily and send an arrow through
4290,BOOK XIX.,the twelve holes whereby twelve axeheads are fitted into
4291,BOOK XIX.,"their handles."""
4292,BOOK XIX.,
4293,BOOK XIX.,"""You need not defer this competition,"" said Ulysses, ""for     582"
4294,BOOK XIX.,your husband will be here before any one of them can draw
4295,BOOK XIX.,"the bow and shoot through the axes."""
4296,BOOK XIX.,
4297,BOOK XIX.,"""Stranger,"" replied Penelope, ""I could stay talking with      588"
4298,BOOK XIX.,"you the whole night through, but there is a time for"
4299,BOOK XIX.,"everything, and I will now go to lie down upon that"
4300,BOOK XIX.,couch which I have never ceased to water with my tears
4301,BOOK XIX.,from the day my husband set out for the city with an
4302,BOOK XIX.,"ill-omened name. You can sleep within the house, either"
4303,BOOK XIX.,"on the ground or on a bedstead, whichever you may prefer."""

4420,BOOK XX.,"cups, Philœtius handed round the bread and Melantheus"
4421,BOOK XX.,poured them out their wine. Telemachus purposely set
4422,BOOK XX.,Ulysses at a little table on the part of the cloister
4423,BOOK XX.,"that was paved with stone, and told the suitors that it"
4424,BOOK XX.,"should be worse for any of them who molested him. ""This,"""
4425,BOOK XX.,"he said, ""is not a public house, but it is mine, for it"
4426,BOOK XX.,"has come to me from Ulysses."""
4427,BOOK XX.,
4428,BOOK XX.,The suitors were very angry but Antinous checked them.       268
4429,BOOK XX.,"""Let us put up with it,"" said he; ""if Jove had permitted,"
4430,BOOK XX.,"we should have been the death of him ere now."" Meanwhile,"
4431,BOOK XX.,"it being the festival of Apollo, the people of the town"
4432,BOOK XX.,were bearing his holy hecatomb about the streets.
4433,BOOK XX.,
4434,BOOK XX.,The servants gave Ulysses an equal portion with what         279
4435,BOOK XX.,"they gave the others, for Telemachus had so bidden them."
4436,BOOK XX.,Presently one of the suitors named Ctesippus observed
4437,BOOK XX.,"this and said, ""I see the stranger has as good a portion"
4438,BOOK XX.,"as any one else. I will give him a better, that he may"
4439,BOOK XX.,have something to give the bath-woman or some other of       296
4440,BOOK XX.,"the servants in the house""--and with this he flung a"
4441,BOOK XX.,cow's heel at Ulysses' head.
4442,BOOK XX.,
4443,BOOK XX.,"Ulysses smiled with a grim Sardinian[36] smile, and bowed    302"
4444,BOOK XX.,his head so that the heel passed over it and hit the
4445,BOOK XX.,"wall. Telemachus rebuked Ctesippus very fiercely, and"
4446,BOOK XX.,"all were silent till Agelaus tried to calm them saying,"
4447,BOOK XX.,"""What Telemachus has said is just: let us not answer."
4448,BOOK XX.,Nevertheless I would urge him to talk quietly with his
4449,BOOK XX.,mother and tell her that as long as there was any chance
4450,BOOK XX.,of Ulysses coming back there was nothing unreasonable in
4451,BOOK XX.,her deferring a second marriage; but there is now no hope
4452,BOOK XX.,"of his return, and if you would enjoy your own in peace,"
4453,BOOK XX.,tell her to marry the best man among us and the one who
4454,BOOK XX.,"will make her the most advantageous offer."""
4455,BOOK XX.,
4456,BOOK XX.,"""Nay,"" answered Telemachus, ""it is not I that delay her      328"
4457,BOOK XX.,"marriage. I urge her to it, but I cannot and will not"
4458,BOOK XX.,"force her."""
4459,BOOK XX.,
4460,BOOK XX.,Then Minerva made the suitors break out into a forced        345
4461,BOOK XX.,"hysterical laughter, and the meats which they were eating"
4462,BOOK XX.,became all smirched with blood. Their eyes were filled
4463,BOOK XX.,with tears and their hearts were oppressed with terrible
4464,BOOK XX.,"forebodings. Theoclymenus saw that all was wrong, and"
4465,BOOK XX.,"said, ""Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is a"
4466,BOOK XX.,"shroud of darkness drawn over you from head to foot, your"
4467,BOOK XX.,cheeks are wet with tears; the air is alive with wailing
4468,BOOK XX.,voices; the walls and roof beams drip blood; the gate
4469,BOOK XX.,"of the cloisters, and the yard beyond them are full of"
4470,BOOK XX.,ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is
4471,BOOK XX.,"blotted out from heaven, and a blighting gloom is over"
4472,BOOK XX.,"all the land."""
4473,BOOK XX.,
4474,BOOK XX.,"The suitors laughed at him, and Eurymachus said, ""If you     358"
4475,BOOK XX.,"find it so dark here, we had better send a man with you"
4476,BOOK XX.,"to take you out into the open."""
4477,BOOK XX.,
4478,BOOK XX.,"""I have eyes,"" he answered, ""that can guide, and feet        363"
4479,BOOK XX.,that can take me from the doom that I see overhanging
4480,BOOK XX.,"every single one of you."" On this he left them and went"
4481,BOOK XX.,back to the house of Piræus.
4482,BOOK XX.,
4483,BOOK XX.,"Then one of the suitors said, ""Telemachus, you are very      375"
4484,BOOK XX.,unfortunate in your guests. You had better ship both the
4485,BOOK XX.,"stranger and this man off to the Sicels and sell them."""
4486,BOOK XX.,"Telemachus made no answer, but kept his eye on his father"
4487,BOOK XX.,for any signal that he might make him.
4488,BOOK XX.,
4489,BOOK XX.,Penelope had had a seat placed for her overlooking the       387
4490,BOOK XX.,"cloister, and heard all that had passed. The dinner had"
4491,BOOK XX.,"been good and plentiful and there had been much laughter,"
4492,BOOK XX.,"for they had slaughtered many victims, but little did"
4493,BOOK XX.,they guess the terrible supper which the goddess and a
4494,BOOK XX.,strong man were preparing for them.

4502,BOOK XXI.,_The trial of the bow and of the axes_.
4503,BOOK XXI.,
4504,BOOK XXI.,
4505,BOOK XXI.,Then Minerva put it in Penelope's mind to let the suitors
4506,BOOK XXI.,compete for the bow and for a prize of iron. So she
4507,BOOK XXI.,"went upstairs and got the key of the store room, where"
4508,BOOK XXI.,"Ulysses' treasures of gold, copper, and iron were kept,"
4509,BOOK XXI.,as also the mighty bow which Iphitus son of Eurytus had
4510,BOOK XXI.,"given him, and which had been in common use by Eurytus"
4511,BOOK XXI.,as long as he was alive. Hither she went attended by her
4512,BOOK XXI.,"women, and when she had unlocked the door she took the"
4513,BOOK XXI.,"bow down from its peg and carried it, with its quiverfull"
4514,BOOK XXI.,"of deadly arrows, to the suitors, while her maids brought"
4515,BOOK XXI.,the chest in which were the many prizes of iron that
4516,BOOK XXI.,"Ulysses had won. Then, still attended by her two maidens,"
4517,BOOK XXI.,she stood by one of the bearing-posts that supported the
4518,BOOK XXI.,"roof of the cloister, and told the suitors she would"
4519,BOOK XXI.,marry the man among them who could string Ulysses' bow
4520,BOOK XXI.,"most easily, and send an arrow through the twelve holes"
4521,BOOK XXI.,by which twelve axe-heads were fastened on to their
4522,BOOK XXI.,handles.
4523,BOOK XXI.,
4524,BOOK XXI.,So saying she gave the bow into the hands of Eumæus and       80
4525,BOOK XXI.,bade him let the suitors compete as she had said. Eumæus
4526,BOOK XXI.,"wept as he took it, and so did Philœtius who was looking"
4527,BOOK XXI.,"on, whereon Antinous scolded them for a couple of country"
4528,BOOK XXI.,bumpkins.
4529,BOOK XXI.,
4530,BOOK XXI.,"Telemachus said that he too should compete, and that         113"
4531,BOOK XXI.,if he was successful he should certainly not allow his
4532,BOOK XXI.,"mother to leave her home with a second husband, while"
4533,BOOK XXI.,he remained alone. So saying he dug a long trench
4534,BOOK XXI.,"quite straight, set the axes in a line within it, and"
4535,BOOK XXI.,stamped the earth about them to keep them steady; every
4536,BOOK XXI.,"one was surprised to see how accurately he fixed them,"
4537,BOOK XXI.,considering that he had never seen anything of the kind
4538,BOOK XXI.,"before.[37] Having set the axes duly, he stood on the"
4539,BOOK XXI.,"stone pavement, and tried to string the bow, but failed"
4540,BOOK XXI.,"three times. He would, however, have succeeded the fourth"
4541,BOOK XXI.,"time, if Ulysses had not made him a sign that he was not"
4542,BOOK XXI.,to try any more. So he laid both bow and arrow down and
4543,BOOK XXI.,took his seat.
4544,BOOK XXI.,
4545,BOOK XXI.,"""Then,"" said Antinous, ""begin at the place where the         140"
4546,BOOK XXI.,"cupbearer begins, and let each take his turn, going from"
4547,BOOK XXI.,"left to right."" On this Leiodes came forward. He was"
4548,BOOK XXI.,"their sacrificial priest, and sat in the angle of the"
4549,BOOK XXI.,wall hard by the mixing bowl; but he had always set his
4550,BOOK XXI.,face against the wicked conduct of the suitors. When he
4551,BOOK XXI.,had failed to string the bow he said it was so hard to
4552,BOOK XXI.,string that it would rob many a man among them of life
4553,BOOK XXI.,and heart--for which saying Antinous rebuked him bitterly.
4554,BOOK XXI.,
4555,BOOK XXI.,"""Bring some fire, Melantheus, and a wheel of fat from        175"
4556,BOOK XXI.,"inside the house,"" said he to Melanthius, [_sic_] ""that"
4557,BOOK XXI.,"we may warm the bow and grease it."" So they did this,"
4558,BOOK XXI.,but though many tried they could none of them string it.
4559,BOOK XXI.,There remained only Antinous and Eurymachus who were
4560,BOOK XXI.,their ring leaders.
4561,BOOK XXI.,
4562,BOOK XXI.,The swineherd and the stockman Philœtius then went           188
4563,BOOK XXI.,"outside the forecourt, and Ulysses followed them; when"
4564,BOOK XXI.,"they had got beyond the outer yard Ulysses sounded them,"
4565,BOOK XXI.,and having satisfied himself that they were loyal he
4566,BOOK XXI.,revealed himself and shewed them the scar on his leg.
4567,BOOK XXI.,"They were overjoyed, and Ulysses said, ""Go back one by"
4568,BOOK XXI.,"one after me, and follow these instructions. The other"
4569,BOOK XXI.,"suitors will not be for letting me have the bow, but do"
4570,BOOK XXI.,"you, Eumæus, when you have got it in your hands, bring it"
4571,BOOK XXI.,"to me, and tell the women to shut themselves into their"
4572,BOOK XXI.,room. If the sound of groaning or uproar reaches any of
4573,BOOK XXI.,"them when they are inside, tell them to stick to their"
4574,BOOK XXI.,"work and not come out. I leave it to you. Philœtius, to"
4575,BOOK XXI.,"fasten the gate of the outer court securely."" He then"
4576,BOOK XXI.,"went inside, and resumed the seat that he had left."
4577,BOOK XXI.,
4578,BOOK XXI.,"Eurymachus now tried to string the bow but failed. ""I do      245"
4579,BOOK XXI.,"not so much mind,"" he said, ""about not marrying Penelope,"
4580,BOOK XXI.,for there are plenty of other women in Ithaca and
4581,BOOK XXI.,elsewhere. What grieves me is the fact of our being such
4582,BOOK XXI.,"a feeble folk as compared with our forefathers."""
4583,BOOK XXI.,
4584,BOOK XXI.,Antinous reminded him that it was the festival of Apollo.     256
4585,BOOK XXI.,"""Who,"" said he, ""can shoot on such a day as this? Let us"
4586,BOOK XXI.,leave the axes where they are--no one will take them; let
4587,BOOK XXI.,us also sacrifice to Apollo the best goats Melanthius can
4588,BOOK XXI.,"bring us, and resume the contest tomorrow."""
4589,BOOK XXI.,
4590,BOOK XXI.,Ulysses then cunningly urged that he might be allowed         274
4591,BOOK XXI.,to try whether he was as strong a man as he used to
4592,BOOK XXI.,"be, and that the bow should be placed in his hands"
4593,BOOK XXI.,"for this purpose. The suitors were very angry, but"
4594,BOOK XXI.,Penelope insisted that Ulysses should have the bow; if
4595,BOOK XXI.,he succeeded in stringing it she said it was absurd to
4596,BOOK XXI.,suppose that she would marry him; but she would give
4597,BOOK XXI.,"him a shirt and cloak, a javelin, sword, and a pair of"
4598,BOOK XXI.,"sandals, and she would send him wherever he might want to"
4599,BOOK XXI.,go.
4600,BOOK XXI.,
4601,BOOK XXI.,"""The bow, mother, is mine,"" said Telemachus, ""and if I        343"
4602,BOOK XXI.,choose to give it this man out and out I shall give it
4603,BOOK XXI.,"him. Go within the house and mind your own proper duties."""
4604,BOOK XXI.,
4605,BOOK XXI.,"Penelope went back, with her women, wondering into the        354"
4606,BOOK XXI.,"house, and going upstairs into her room she wept for her"
4607,BOOK XXI.,dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes.
4608,BOOK XXI.,
4609,BOOK XXI.,"Eumæus was about to take the bow to Ulysses, but the          359"
4610,BOOK XXI.,"suitors frightened him and he was for putting it down,"
4611,BOOK XXI.,till Telemachus threatened to stone him back to his farm
4612,BOOK XXI.,if he did not bring it on at once; he therefore gave the
4613,BOOK XXI.,bow to Ulysses. Then he called Euryclea aside and told
4614,BOOK XXI.,"her to shut the women up, and not to let them out if they"
4615,BOOK XXI.,heard any groans or uproar. She therefore shut them up.
4616,BOOK XXI.,
4617,BOOK XXI.,At this point Philœtius slipped out and secured the main      388
4618,BOOK XXI.,gate of the outer court with a ship's cable of Byblus
4619,BOOK XXI.,"fibre that happened to be lying beside it. This done, he"
4620,BOOK XXI.,"returned to his seat and kept his eye on Ulysses, who was"
4621,BOOK XXI.,examining the bow with great care to see whether it was
4622,BOOK XXI.,sound in all its parts.
4623,BOOK XXI.,
4624,BOOK XXI.,"""This man,"" said the suitors, ""is some old bow-fancier;       397"
4625,BOOK XXI.,"perhaps he has got one like it at home, or wants to make"
4626,BOOK XXI.,"one, so cunningly does the old rascal handle it."""
4627,BOOK XXI.,
4628,BOOK XXI.,"Ulysses, having finished his scrutiny, strung the bow as      404"
4629,BOOK XXI.,easily as a bard puts a new string on to his lyre. He
4630,BOOK XXI.,tried the string and it sang under his hand like the cry
4631,BOOK XXI.,of a swallow. He took an arrow that was lying out of its
4632,BOOK XXI.,"quiver by his table, placed the notch on the string, and"
4633,BOOK XXI.,from his seat sent the arrow through the handle-holes of
4634,BOOK XXI.,all the axes and outside into the yard.
4635,BOOK XXI.,
4636,BOOK XXI.,"""Telemachus,"" said he, ""your guest has not disgraced you.     424"
4637,BOOK XXI.,"It is now time for the suitors to have their supper, and"
4638,BOOK XXI.,to take their pleasure afterwards with song and playing
4639,BOOK XXI.,"on the lyre."" So saying he made a sign to Telemachus, who"
4640,BOOK XXI.,"girded on his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed"
4641,BOOK XXI.,beside his father's seat.

4651,BOOK XXII.,
4652,BOOK XXII.,"Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on the broad"
4653,BOOK XXII.,"pavement,[38] with his bow and his quiver full of arrows."
4654,BOOK XXII.,"He shed the arrows on to the ground at his feet and said,"
4655,BOOK XXII.,"""The contest is at an end. I will now see whether Apollo"
4656,BOOK XXII.,will vouchsafe me to hit another mark which no man has
4657,BOOK XXII.,"yet aimed at."""
4658,BOOK XXII.,
4659,BOOK XXII.,He took aim at Antinous as he spoke. The arrow struck           8
4660,BOOK XXII.,"him in the throat, so that he fell over and a thick"
4661,BOOK XXII.,stream of blood gushed from his nostrils. He kicked his
4662,BOOK XXII.,"table from him and upset the things on it, whereby the"
4663,BOOK XXII.,bread and meats were all soiled as they fell over on
4664,BOOK XXII.,"to the ground. The suitors were instantly in an uproar,"
4665,BOOK XXII.,"and looked towards the walls for armour, but there was"
4666,BOOK XXII.,"none. ""Stranger,"" they cried, ""you shall pay dearly for"
4667,BOOK XXII.,"shooting people down in this way. You are a doomed man."""
4668,BOOK XXII.,But they did not yet understand that Ulysses had killed
4669,BOOK XXII.,Antinous on purpose.
4670,BOOK XXII.,
4671,BOOK XXII.,"Ulysses glared at them and said, ""Dogs, did you think          34"
4672,BOOK XXII.,that I should not return from Troy? You have wasted my
4673,BOOK XXII.,"substance, you have violated the women of my house, you"
4674,BOOK XXII.,"have wooed my wife while I was still alive, you have"
4675,BOOK XXII.,"feared neither god nor man, and now you shall die."""
4676,BOOK XXII.,
4677,BOOK XXII.,"Eurymachus alone answered. ""If you are Ulysses,"" said          44"
4678,BOOK XXII.,"he, ""we have done you great wrong. It was all Antinous's"
4679,BOOK XXII.,doing. He never really wanted to marry Penelope: he
4680,BOOK XXII.,wanted to kill your son and to be chief man in Ithaca. He
4681,BOOK XXII.,is no more; then spare the lives of your people and we
4682,BOOK XXII.,"will pay you all."""
4683,BOOK XXII.,
4684,BOOK XXII.,"Ulysses again glared at him and said, ""I will not stay         60"
4685,BOOK XXII.,my hand till I have slain one and all of you. You must
4686,BOOK XXII.,"fight, or fly as you can, or die--and fly you neither can"
4687,BOOK XXII.,"nor shall."""
4688,BOOK XXII.,
4689,BOOK XXII.,"Eurymachus then said, ""My friends, this man will give us       68"
4690,BOOK XXII.,no quarter. Let us show fight. Draw your swords and hold
4691,BOOK XXII.,the tables up in front of you as shields. Have at him
4692,BOOK XXII.,"with a rush, and drive him from the pavement and from the"
4693,BOOK XXII.,door. We could then get through into the town and call
4694,BOOK XXII.,"for help."""
4695,BOOK XXII.,
4696,BOOK XXII.,"While he spoke and was springing forward, Ulysses sent         79"
4697,BOOK XXII.,an arrow into his heart and he fell doubled up over his
4698,BOOK XXII.,table. The cup and all the meats went over on to the
4699,BOOK XXII.,ground as he smote the earth with his forehead in the
4700,BOOK XXII.,agonies of death.
4701,BOOK XXII.,
4702,BOOK XXII.,Amphinomus then made for Ulysses to try and dislodge           89
4703,BOOK XXII.,"him from the door, but Telemachus got behind him, and"
4704,BOOK XXII.,struck him through. He left his spear in the body and
4705,BOOK XXII.,"flew back to his father's side; ""Father,"" said he, ""let"
4706,BOOK XXII.,"me bring armour for you and me, as well as for Eumæus and"
4707,BOOK XXII.,"Philœtius."" ""Run and fetch it,"" answered Ulysses, ""while"

4709,BOOK XXII.,"from the door when I am single-handed."""
4710,BOOK XXII.,
4711,BOOK XXII.,Telemachus went to the store-room and brought four            108
4712,BOOK XXII.,"shields, eight spears, and four helmets. He armed"
4713,BOOK XXII.,"himself, as did also Eumæus and Philœtius, who then"
4714,BOOK XXII.,placed themselves beside Ulysses. As long as his arrows
4715,BOOK XXII.,held out Ulysses shot the suitors down thick and
4716,BOOK XXII.,"threefold, but when they failed him he stood the bow"
4717,BOOK XXII.,"against the end wall of the house hard by the door way,"
4718,BOOK XXII.,and armed himself.
4719,BOOK XXII.,
4720,BOOK XXII.,"Now there was a trap-door (see plan, and _f_ on p. 17)   126"
4721,BOOK XXII.,"on the wall, while at one end of the pavement there was an"
4722,BOOK XXII.,"exit, closed by a good strong door and leading out into a"
4723,BOOK XXII.,narrow passage; Ulysses told Philœtius to stand by this
4724,BOOK XXII.,"door and keep it, for only one person could attack it at"
4725,BOOK XXII.,"a time. Then Agelaus shouted out, ""Go up, somebody, to"
4726,BOOK XXII.,the trap-door and tell the people what is going on; they
4727,BOOK XXII.,"would come in and help us."""
4728,BOOK XXII.,
4729,BOOK XXII.,"""This may not be,"" answered Melanthius, ""the mouth of the     135"
4730,BOOK XXII.,narrow passage is dangerously near the entrance from the
4731,BOOK XXII.,street into the outer court. One brave man could prevent
4732,BOOK XXII.,"any number from getting in, but I will bring you arms"
4733,BOOK XXII.,"from the store-room, for I am sure it is there that they"
4734,BOOK XXII.,"have put them."" As he spoke he went by back passages to       143"
4735,BOOK XXII.,"the store-room, and brought the suitors twelve shields"
4736,BOOK XXII.,and the same number of helmets; when Ulysses saw the
4737,BOOK XXII.,"suitors arming his heart began to fail him, and he said"
4738,BOOK XXII.,"to Telemachus, ""Some of the women inside are helping the"
4739,BOOK XXII.,"suitors--or else it is Melanthius."""
4740,BOOK XXII.,
4741,BOOK XXII.,"Telemachus said that it was his fault, for he had left        153"
4742,BOOK XXII.,"the store-room door open. ""Go, Eumæus,"" he added,"
4743,BOOK XXII.,"""and close it; see whether it is one of the women, or"
4744,BOOK XXII.,"Melanthius, son of Dolius."""
4745,BOOK XXII.,
4746,BOOK XXII.,Melanthius was now going back for more armour when Eumæus     160
4747,BOOK XXII.,"saw him and told Ulysses, who said, ""Follow him, you"
4748,BOOK XXII.,"and Philœtius; bind his hands and feet behind him, and"
4749,BOOK XXII.,throw him into the store-room; then string him up to a
4750,BOOK XXII.,"bearing-post till he is close to the rafters, that he may"
4751,BOOK XXII.,"linger on in agony."""
4752,BOOK XXII.,
4753,BOOK XXII.,The men went to the store-room and caught Melanthius.         178
4754,BOOK XXII.,They bound him in a painful bond and strung him up as
4755,BOOK XXII.,Ulysses had told them. Eumæus wished him a good night
4756,BOOK XXII.,and the two men returned to the side of Ulysses. Minerva
4757,BOOK XXII.,"also joined them, having assumed the form of Mentor; but      205"
4758,BOOK XXII.,Ulysses felt sure it was Minerva. The suitors were very
4759,BOOK XXII.,"angry when they saw her; ""Mentor,"" they cried, ""you shall"
4760,BOOK XXII.,"pay for this with your life, and we will confiscate all"
4761,BOOK XXII.,"you have in the world."""
4762,BOOK XXII.,
4763,BOOK XXII.,"This made Minerva furious, and she rated Ulysses roundly.     224"
4764,BOOK XXII.,"""Your prowess,"" said she, ""is no longer what it was at"
4765,BOOK XXII.,Troy. How comes it that you are less valiant now that you
4766,BOOK XXII.,"are on your own ground? Come on, my good fellow, and see"
4767,BOOK XXII.,how Mentor will fight for you and requite you for your
4768,BOOK XXII.,"many kindnesses."" But she did not mean to give him the"
4769,BOOK XXII.,"victory just yet, so she flew up to one of the rafters"
4770,BOOK XXII.,and sat there in the form of a swallow.[39]
4771,BOOK XXII.,
4772,BOOK XXII.,"The struggle still continued. ""My friends,"" said Agelaus,     241"

4781,BOOK XXII.,"a corner, whereon the four sprang forward and regained"
4782,BOOK XXII.,"their weapons. The suitors again threw, and this time"
4783,BOOK XXII.,Amphimedon really did take a piece of the top skin from
4784,BOOK XXII.,"Telemachus's wrist, and Ctesippus just grazed Eumæus's"
4785,BOOK XXII.,shoulder above his shield. It was now the turn of Ulysses
4786,BOOK XXII.,"and his men, and each of their spears killed a man."
4787,BOOK XXII.,
4788,BOOK XXII.,Then Minerva from high on the roof held up her deadly         297

4797,BOOK XXII.,"standing near towards the trap-door, and resolving to"
4798,BOOK XXII.,"embrace Ulysses' knees, he laid his lyre on the ground"
4799,BOOK XXII.,between the mixing-bowl and the high silver-studded
4800,BOOK XXII.,"seat. ""Spare me,"" he cried, ""you will be sorry for it"
4801,BOOK XXII.,afterwards if you kill such a bard as I am. I am an
4802,BOOK XXII.,"original composer, and heaven visits me with every kind"
4803,BOOK XXII.,of inspiration. Do not be in such a hurry to cut my head

4817,BOOK XXII.,"substance and been so disrespectful to yourself."" Ulysses"
4818,BOOK XXII.,"smiled, and told them to go outside into the outer court"
4819,BOOK XXII.,"till the killing should be over. So they went, but they"
4820,BOOK XXII.,were still very much frightened. Ulysses then went all
4821,BOOK XXII.,over the court to see if there were any who had concealed
4822,BOOK XXII.,"themselves, or were not yet killed, but there was no one;"
4823,BOOK XXII.,they were all as dead as fish lying in a hot sun upon the
4824,BOOK XXII.,beach.
4825,BOOK XXII.,
4826,BOOK XXII.,"Then he told Telemachus to call Euryclea, who came at         390"
4827,BOOK XXII.,"once, and found him all covered with blood. When she"
4828,BOOK XXII.,saw the corpses she was beginning to raise a shout of
4829,BOOK XXII.,"triumph, but Ulysses checked her: ""Old woman,"" said he,       411"
4830,BOOK XXII.,"""rejoice in silence; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over"

4851,BOOK XXII.,
4852,BOOK XXII.,The women came down weeping and wailing bitterly.             446
4853,BOOK XXII.,"First they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them"
4854,BOOK XXII.,against one another in the gatehouse of the outer court.
4855,BOOK XXII.,Ulysses ordered them about and saw that they lost no

4857,BOOK XXII.,"all the tables and seats with sponges and water, while"
4858,BOOK XXII.,Telemachus and the two others shovelled up the blood
4859,BOOK XXII.,and dirt from the ground and the women carried it all
4860,BOOK XXII.,outside. When they had thus thoroughly cleaned the whole
4861,BOOK XXII.,"court, they took the women out and hemmed them up in the"
4862,BOOK XXII.,narrow space between the vaulted room and the wall of the
4863,BOOK XXII.,"outer yard. Here Telemachus determined to hang them, as"
4864,BOOK XXII.,a more dishonourable death than stabbing. He therefore        462
4865,BOOK XXII.,made a ship's rope fast to a strong bearing-post
4866,BOOK XXII.,"supporting the roof of the vaulted room, and threw it"
4867,BOOK XXII.,"round, making the women put their heads in the nooses one"
4868,BOOK XXII.,"after another. He then drew the rope high up, so that"
4869,BOOK XXII.,none of their feet might touch the ground. They kicked
4870,BOOK XXII.,"convulsively for a while, but not for very long."
4871,BOOK XXII.,
4872,BOOK XXII.,As for Melanthius they took him through the cloisters         474
4873,BOOK XXII.,into the outer court. There they cut off his nose and
4874,BOOK XXII.,"ears; they drew out his vitals and gave them to the dogs,"
4875,BOOK XXII.,raw; then they cut off his hands and feet. When they had
4876,BOOK XXII.,"done this they washed their hands and feet, and went"
4877,BOOK XXII.,"back into the house. ""Go,"" said Ulysses, to Euryclea,"
4878,BOOK XXII.,"""and bring me sulphur that I may burn it and purify the"

4886,BOOK XXII.,"""Light me a fire,"" answered Ulysses, and she obeyed and       490"
4887,BOOK XXII.,"brought him sulphur, wherewith he thoroughly purified"
4888,BOOK XXII.,"both the inner and outer court, as well as the cloisters."
4889,BOOK XXII.,"Then Euryclea brought the women from their apartment,"
4890,BOOK XXII.,"and they pressed round Ulysses, kissing his head and"

4997,BOOK XXIII.,
4998,BOOK XXIII.,"Then Penelope was convinced that he really was Ulysses,       205"
4999,BOOK XXIII.,"and fairly broke down. She flung her arms about his neck,"
5000,BOOK XXIII.,and said she had only held aloof so long because she had
5001,BOOK XXIII.,been shuddering at the bare thought of any one deceiving
5002,BOOK XXIII.,"her. Ulysses in his turn melted and embraced her, and"
5003,BOOK XXIII.,they would have gone on indulging their sorrow till

5010,BOOK XXIII.,which Penelope rejoined that as she should certainly have

5023,BOOK XXIII.,"Philœtius, and Eumæus now left off dancing, and made the"

5026,BOOK XXIII.,
5027,BOOK XXIII.,"When they were in bed together, Penelope told Ulysses how     300"
5028,BOOK XXIII.,much she had had to bear in seeing the house filled with
5029,BOOK XXIII.,wicked suitors who had killed so many oxen and sheep on
5030,BOOK XXIII.,"her account, and had drunk so many casks of wine. Ulysses"
5031,BOOK XXIII.,"in his turn told her the whole story of his adventures,"
5032,BOOK XXIII.,"touching briefly upon every point, and detailing not          310"
5033,BOOK XXIII.,only his own sufferings but those he had inflicted upon
5034,BOOK XXIII.,"other people. She was delighted to listen, and never went"

5133,BOOK XXIV.,"who should wash well, eat well, and lie soft at night"
5134,BOOK XXIV.,"as old men have a right to do. But tell me, and tell me"
5135,BOOK XXIV.,"true, whose bondsman are you, and in whose garden are you"
5136,BOOK XXIV.,working? Tell me also about another matter--is this place
5137,BOOK XXIV.,that I have come to really Ithaca? I met a man just now
5138,BOOK XXIV.,"who said so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the"
5139,BOOK XXIV.,patience to hear my story out when I was asking whether
5140,BOOK XXIV.,an old friend of mine who used to live here was still
5141,BOOK XXIV.,alive. My friend said he was the son of Laertes son of
5142,BOOK XXIV.,"Arceisius, and I made him large presents on his leaving"
5143,BOOK XXIV.,"me."""
5144,BOOK XXIV.,
5145,BOOK XXIV.,Laertes wept and answered that in this case he would         280
5146,BOOK XXIV.,"never see his presents back again, though he would have"
5147,BOOK XXIV.,"been amply requited if Ulysses had been alive. ""But tell"
5148,BOOK XXIV.,"me,"" he said, ""who and whence are you? Where is your"
5149,BOOK XXIV.,ship? or did you come as passenger on some other man's
5150,BOOK XXIV.,"vessel?"""
5151,BOOK XXIV.,
5152,BOOK XXIV.,"""I will tell you every thing,"" answered Ulysses, ""quite      302"
5153,BOOK XXIV.,"truly. I come from Alybas, and am son to king Apheides."
5154,BOOK XXIV.,My name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off my course as I
5155,BOOK XXIV.,"was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried here against"
5156,BOOK XXIV.,"my will. As for my ship, it is lying over yonder off the     307"
5157,BOOK XXIV.,open country outside the town. It is five years since
5158,BOOK XXIV.,Ulysses left me--Poor fellow! we had every hope that we      308
5159,BOOK XXIV.,"should meet again and exchange presents."""
5160,BOOK XXIV.,
5161,BOOK XXIV.,"Laertes was overcome with grief, and Ulysses was so          315"
5162,BOOK XXIV.,much touched that he revealed himself. When his father
5163,BOOK XXIV.,"asked for proof, he shewed him the scar on his leg."
5164,BOOK XXIV.,"""Furthermore,"" he added, ""I will point out to you the"
5165,BOOK XXIV.,"trees in the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked"
5166,BOOK XXIV.,you all about them as I followed you round the garden.
5167,BOOK XXIV.,"We went over them all, and you told me their names and"
5168,BOOK XXIV.,"what they all were. You gave me thirteen pear trees, ten"
5169,BOOK XXIV.,"apple trees, and forty fig trees, and you also said you"
5170,BOOK XXIV.,would give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn planted
5171,BOOK XXIV.,"between each row, and the vines yield grapes of every"
5172,BOOK XXIV.,"kind when the heat of heaven has beaten upon them."" He"
5173,BOOK XXIV.,also told his father that he had killed the suitors.
5174,BOOK XXIV.,
5175,BOOK XXIV.,"Laertes was now convinced, but said he feared he should      345"
5176,BOOK XXIV.,have all the people of Ithaca coming to attack them.
5177,BOOK XXIV.,"Ulysses answered that he need not trouble about this, and"
5178,BOOK XXIV.,"that they had better go and get their dinner, which would"
5179,BOOK XXIV.,be ready by the time they got to the house.
5180,BOOK XXIV.,
5181,BOOK XXIV.,When they reached the house the old Sicel woman took         361
5182,BOOK XXIV.,"Laertes inside, washed him, and anointed him. Minerva"
5183,BOOK XXIV.,also gave him a more imposing presence and made him look
5184,BOOK XXIV.,"taller and stronger than before. ""When he came back,"
5185,BOOK XXIV.,"Ulysses said, ""My dear father, some god has been making"
5186,BOOK XXIV.,"you much taller and better looking."" To which Laertes"
5187,BOOK XXIV.,answered that if he was as young and hearty as when he
5188,BOOK XXIV.,"took the stronghold Nericum on the foreland, he should"
5189,BOOK XXIV.,"have been a great help to him on the preceding day, and"
5190,BOOK XXIV.,would have killed many suitors.
5191,BOOK XXIV.,
5192,BOOK XXIV.,"Dolius and his sons, who had been working hard by, now       383"
5193,BOOK XXIV.,"came up, for the old Sicel woman, who was Dolius's"
5194,BOOK XXIV.,"wife, had been to fetch them. When they were satisfied"
5195,BOOK XXIV.,"that Ulysses was really there, they were overjoyed and"
5196,BOOK XXIV.,"embraced him one after the other. ""But tell me,"" said"
5197,BOOK XXIV.,"Dolius, ""does Penelope know, or shall we send and tell"
5198,BOOK XXIV.,"her?"" ""Old man,"" answered Ulysses, ""she knows already."
5199,BOOK XXIV.,"What business is that of yours?"" Then they all took their"
5200,BOOK XXIV.,seats at table.
5201,BOOK XXIV.,
5202,BOOK XXIV.,Meanwhile the news of the slaughter of the suitors had       412
5203,BOOK XXIV.,"got noised abroad, and the people gathered hooting and"
5204,BOOK XXIV.,groaning before the house of Ulysses. They took their
5205,BOOK XXIV.,"dead, buried every man his own, and put the bodies of"
5206,BOOK XXIV.,those who came from elsewhere on board the fishing
5207,BOOK XXIV.,"vessels, for the fishermen to take them every man to his"
5208,BOOK XXIV.,own place. Then they met in assembly and Eupeithes urged
5209,BOOK XXIV.,them to pursue Ulysses and the others before they could
5210,BOOK XXIV.,escape over to the main land.
5211,BOOK XXIV.,
5212,BOOK XXIV.,"Medon, however, and Phemius had now woke up, and came to     439"
5213,BOOK XXIV.,the assembly. Medon dissuaded the people from doing as
5214,BOOK XXIV.,"Eupeithes advised, inasmuch as he had seen a god going"
5215,BOOK XXIV.,"about killing the suitors, and it would be dangerous to"
5216,BOOK XXIV.,oppose the will of heaven. Halitherses also spoke in the
5217,BOOK XXIV.,"same sense, and half the people were pursuaded by him."
5218,BOOK XXIV.,The other half armed themselves and followed Eupeithes in
5219,BOOK XXIV.,pursuit of Ulysses.
5220,BOOK XXIV.,
5221,BOOK XXIV.,Minerva then consulted Jove as to the course events          472
5222,BOOK XXIV.,should take. Jove told her that she had had everything
5223,BOOK XXIV.,"her own way so far, and might continue to do as she"
5224,BOOK XXIV.,"pleased. He should, however, advise that both sides"
5225,BOOK XXIV.,should now be reconciled under the continued rule of
5226,BOOK XXIV.,Ulysses. Minerva approved of this and darted down to
5227,BOOK XXIV.,Ithaca.
5228,BOOK XXIV.,
5229,BOOK XXIV.,"Laertes and his household had now done dinner, and           489"
5230,BOOK XXIV.,Eupeithes with his band of men were seen to be near at
5231,BOOK XXIV.,"hand. Ulysses and the others put on their armour, and"
5232,BOOK XXIV.,"Minerva joined them. ""Telemachus,"" said Ulysses, ""now"
5233,BOOK XXIV.,"that you are about to fight in a decisive engagement,"
5234,BOOK XXIV.,"see that you do no discredit to your ancestors, who were"
5235,BOOK XXIV.,"eminent all the world over for their strength and valour."""
5236,BOOK XXIV.,
5237,BOOK XXIV.,"""You shall see, my dear father,"" replied Telemachus, ""if     510"
5238,BOOK XXIV.,"you choose, that I am in no mind, as you say, to disgrace"
5239,BOOK XXIV.,"your family."""
5240,BOOK XXIV.,
5241,BOOK XXIV.,"""Good heavens,"" exclaimed Laertes, ""what a day I am          513"
5242,BOOK XXIV.,enjoying. My son and grandson are vying with one another
5243,BOOK XXIV.,"in the matter of valour."" Minerva then came up to him,"
5244,BOOK XXIV.,and bade him pray to her. She infused fresh vigour into
5245,BOOK XXIV.,"him, and when he had prayed to her he aimed his spear"
5246,BOOK XXIV.,at Eupeithes and killed him. Ulysses and his men fell
5247,BOOK XXIV.,"upon the others, routed them, and would have killed one"
5248,BOOK XXIV.,and all of them had not Minerva raised her voice and
5249,BOOK XXIV.,"made every one pause. ""Men of Ithaca,"" she cried, ""cease"
5250,BOOK XXIV.,"this dreadful war, and settle the matter without further"
5251,BOOK XXIV.,"bloodshed."""
5252,BOOK XXIV.,
5253,BOOK XXIV.,"On this they turned pale with fear, dropped their armour,    533"
5254,BOOK XXIV.,and fled every man towards the city. Ulysses was  swooping
5255,BOOK XXIV.,"down upon them like an eagle, but Jove sent a thunderbolt"
5256,BOOK XXIV.,"of fire that fell just in front of Minerva. ""Whereon she"
5257,BOOK XXIV.,"said, ""Ulysses, stay this strife, or Jove will be angry"
5258,BOOK XXIV.,"with you."""
5259,BOOK XXIV.,
5260,BOOK XXIV.,Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Minerva then assumed the voice    545
5261,BOOK XXIV.,"and form of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of"
5262,BOOK XXIV.,peace between the two contending parties.

5310,BOOK XXIV.,"[15] It is a little odd that this disc should have been brought,"
5311,BOOK XXIV.,considering that none such were used by the Phæacians. We must suppose
5312,BOOK XXIV.,"that Minerva put it in along with the others, and then shed a thick"

5319,BOOK XXIV.,"ship that was to take Ulysses to Ithaca (see xiii. 18, &c.), but here"
5320,BOOK XXIV.,his contributions seem to have ended.
5321,BOOK XXIV.,
5322,BOOK XXIV.,[17] Dwellers on the East coast of Sicily believe the island here
5323,BOOK XXIV.,"referred to to be Acitrezza, between Acireale and Catania. I have been"
5324,BOOK XXIV.,all over it and do not believe that it contains more than two acres of
5325,BOOK XXIV.,land on which any goat could ever have fed. The idea that the writer
5326,BOOK XXIV.,of the _Odyssey_ would make Ulysses and his large body of men spend
5327,BOOK XXIV.,half a day in killing over a hundred goats on such a site need not be
5328,BOOK XXIV.,"discussed seriously, I shall therefore pass it over without notice"
5329,BOOK XXIV.,when I come to discuss the voyage of Ulysses. That it should be so
5330,BOOK XXIV.,confidently believed to be the island off the land of the Cyclopes
5331,BOOK XXIV.,"serves as a warning to myself, inasmuch as it shows how easily people"
5332,BOOK XXIV.,can bring themselves to accept any site for any scene if they make up
5333,BOOK XXIV.,their minds to do so.
5334,BOOK XXIV.,
5335,BOOK XXIV.,[18] See Chapter xv. for reasons why I have bracketed lines 115--137.
5336,BOOK XXIV.,

5344,BOOK XXIV.,
5345,BOOK XXIV.,[21] I suppose this line to have been added when lines 426--446 of this

5347,BOOK XXIV.,
5348,BOOK XXIV.,"[22] The wandering cliffs are certainly intended, for when Ulysses is"

5350,BOOK XXIV.,"having reached the πλαγκτὰς πέτρας, just after the Sirens, and before"
5351,BOOK XXIV.,Scylla and Charybdis (xxiii. 327). The writer is determined to have

5394,BOOK XXIV.,"probably, neither had the writer of the _Odyssey_--at any rate no"
5395,BOOK XXIV.,"commentator has yet been able to understand her description, and I"
5396,BOOK XXIV.,doubt whether she understood it herself. It looks as though the axe

5398,BOOK XXIV.,to let the hole be visible through which the handle would go when the
5399,BOOK XXIV.,"axe was in use. The trial is evidently a double one, of strength as"

5407,BOOK XXIV.,"[39] This again suggests, though it does not prove, that we are in an"

5410,BOOK XXIV.,"roof"" being, no doubt, the roof of the cloister, on to which Minerva"
5411,BOOK XXIV.,"flew from the rafter, that her ægis might better command the whole"

5417,BOOK XXIV.,[41] This room was apparently not within the body of the house. It was
5418,BOOK XXIV.,"certainly on the ground floor, for the bed was fixed on to the stump"

5420,BOOK XXIV.,"outside of which the bodies of the guilty maids were still hanging, and"
5421,BOOK XXIV.,I also suspect it was in order to thus festoon the room that Telemachus

5437,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,views concerning the sex of the writer which have yet been presented to
5438,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"me, I now turn to the evidence of female authorship which is furnished"
5439,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,by the story which I have just laid before the reader.
5440,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5441,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"What, let me ask, is the most unerring test of female authorship?"
5442,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Surely a preponderance of female interest, and a fuller knowledge of"
5443,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"those things which a woman generally has to deal with, than of those"
5444,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,that fall more commonly within the province of man. People always write
5445,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"by preference of what they know best, and they know best what they most"
5446,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"are, and have most to do with. This extends to ways of thought and to"
5447,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"character, even more than to action. If man thinks the noblest study"
5448,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"for mankind to be man, woman not less certainly believes it to be woman."
5449,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5450,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,Hence if in any work the women are found to be well and sympathetically
5451,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"drawn, while the men are mechanical and by comparison perfunctorily"
5452,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"treated, it is, I imagine, safe to infer that the writer is a woman;"
5453,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,and the converse holds good with man. Man and woman never fully
5454,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"understand one another save, perhaps, during courtship and honeymoon,"
5455,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"and as a man understands man more fully than a woman can do, so does a"
5456,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"woman, woman. Granted, it is the delight of either sex to understand"
5457,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"the other as fully as it can, and those who succeed most in this"
5458,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,respect are the best and happiest whether men or women; but do what
5459,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"we may the barriers can never be broken down completely, and each sex"
5460,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"will dwell mainly, though not, of course, exclusively, within its own"
5461,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"separate world. When, moreover, we come to think of it, it is not"
5462,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"desirable that they should be broken down, for it is on their existence"
5463,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,that much of the attraction of either sex to the other depends.
5464,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5465,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,Men seem unable to draw women at all without either laughing at them
5466,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"or caricaturing them; and so, perhaps, a woman never draws a man so"
5467,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,felicitously as when she is making him ridiculous. If she means to
5468,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,make him so she is certain to succeed; if she does not mean it she
5469,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"will succeed more surely still. Either sex, in fact, can caricature"
5470,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"the other delightfully, and certainly no writer has ever shown more"
5471,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"completely than the writer of the _Odyssey_ has done that, next to the"
5472,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"glorification of woman, she considers man's little ways and weaknesses"
5473,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,to be the fittest theme on which her genius can be displayed. But I
5474,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"doubt whether any writer in the whole range of literature (excepting,"
5475,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"I suppose, Shakspeare) has succeeded in drawing a full length,"
5476,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"life-sized, serious portrait of a member of the sex opposite to the"
5477,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,writer's own.
5478,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5479,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,It is admitted on all hands that the preponderance of interest in the
5480,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"_Iliad_ is on the side of man, and in the _Odyssey_ on that of woman."
5481,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,Women in the _Iliad_ are few in number and rarely occupy the stage.
5482,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"True, the goddesses play important parts, but they are never taken"
5483,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,seriously.
5484,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5485,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Shelley, again, speaking of the ""perpetually increasing magnificence of"
5486,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"the last seven books"" of the _Iliad_, says, ""The _Odyssey_ is sweet,"
5487,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"but there is nothing like this.""[1] The writer of the _Odyssey_ is"
5488,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"fierce as a tigress at times, but the feeling of the poem is on the"
5489,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,whole exactly what Shelley says it is. Strength is felt everywhere even
5490,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"in the tenderest passages of the _Iliad_, but it is sweetness rather"
5491,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,than strength that fascinates us throughout the _Odyssey_. It is the
5492,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,charm of a woman not of a man.
5493,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5494,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"So, again, to quote a more recent authority, Mr. Gladstone in his work"
5495,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"on _Homer_ already referred to, says (p. 28):--"
5496,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5497,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,It is rarely in the _Iliad_ that grandeur or force give way to allow
5498,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"the exhibition of domestic affection. Conversely, in the _Odyssey_ the"
5499,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,family life supplies the tissue into which is woven the thread of the
5500,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,poem.
5501,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5502,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,Any one who is familiar with the two poems must know that what Mr.
5503,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Gladstone has said is true; and he might have added, not less truly,"
5504,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,that when there is any exhibition of domestic life and affection in the
5505,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"_Iliad_ the men are dominant, and the women are under their protection,"
5506,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"whereas throughout the _Odyssey_ it is the women who are directing,"
5507,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"counselling, and protecting the men."
5508,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5509,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Who are the women in the _Odyssey_? There is Minerva, omnipresent"
5510,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,at the elbows of Ulysses and Telemachus to keep them straight and
5511,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,alternately scold and flatter them. In the _Iliad_ she is a great
5512,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,warrior but she is no woman: in the _Odyssey_ she is a great woman but
5513,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"no warrior; we have, of course, Penelope--masterful nearly to the last"
5514,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,and tossed off to the wings almost from the moment that she has ceased
5515,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"to be so; Euryclea, the old servant, is quite a match for Telemachus,"
5516,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"""do not find fault, child,"" she says to him, ""when there is no one to"
5517,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"find fault with"" (xx. 135). Who can doubt that Helen is master in the"
5518,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"house of Menelaus--of whom all she can say in praise is that he is ""not"
5519,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"deficient either in person or understanding"" (iv. 264)? Idothea in Book"
5520,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"iv. treats Menelaus _de haut en bas_, all through the Proteus episode."
5521,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"She is good to him and his men, but they must do exactly what she tells"
5522,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"them, and she evidently enjoys ""running"" them,--for I can think of no"
5523,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"apter word. Calypso is the master mind, not Ulysses; and, be it noted,"
5524,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,that neither she nor Circe seem to have a manservant on their premises.
5525,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,I was at an inn once and asked the stately landlady if I could see the
5526,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"landlord. She bridled up and answered, ""We have no landlord, sir, in"
5527,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,this house; I cannot see what use a man is in a hotel except to clean
5528,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"boots and windows."" There spoke Circe and Calypso, but neither of them"
5529,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,seem to have made even this much exception in man's favour.
5530,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5531,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Let the reader ask any single ladies of his acquaintance, who live in"
5532,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"a house of their own, whether they prefer being waited upon by men"
5533,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"or by women, and I shall be much surprised if he does not find that"
5534,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,they generally avoid having a man about the house at all--gardeners
5535,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"of course excepted. But then the gardener generally has a wife, and a"
5536,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,house of his own.
5537,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5538,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Take Nausicaa again, delightful as she is, it would not be wise to"
5539,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"contradict her; she knows what is good for Ulysses, and all will go"
5540,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"well with him so long as he obeys her, but she must be master and he"
5541,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"man. I see I have passed over Ino in Book v. She is Idothea over again,"
5542,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"just as Circe is Calypso, with very little variation. Who again is"
5543,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,master--Queen Arete or King Alcinous? Nausicaa knows well enough how to
5544,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,answer this question. When giving her instructions to Ulysses she says:
5545,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5546,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"""Never mind my father, but go up to my mother and embrace"
5547,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,her knees; if she is well disposed towards you there is
5548,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,some chance of your getting home to see your friends
5549,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"again"" (vi. 310-315)."
5550,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5551,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Throughout the Phæacian episode Arēte (whose name, by the way, I take"
5552,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"to be one of the writer's tolerably transparent disguises, and to be"
5553,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"intended to suggest Arĕte, or ""Goodness"") is a more important person"
5554,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,than Alcinous. I do not believe in her myself; I believe Penelope
5555,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,would have been made more amiable if Arete had been as nice a person
5556,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"as the writer says she was; leaving her, however, on one side, so"
5557,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,much more important are wives than husbands in the eyes of the author
5558,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,of the _Odyssey_ that when Ulysses makes his farewell speech to the
5559,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Phæacians, she makes him say that he hopes they may continue to give"
5560,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"satisfaction to their wives and children (xiii. 44, 45), instead of"
5561,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,hoping that their wives and children will continue to give satisfaction
5562,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,to them. A little lower down he wishes Queen Arete all happiness with
5563,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"her children, her people, and lastly with King Alcinous. As for King"
5564,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Alcinous, it does not matter whether he is happy or no, provided he"
5565,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,gives satisfaction to Queen Arete; but he was bound to be happy as the
5566,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,husband of such an admirable woman.
5567,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5568,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,So when the Duke of York was being married I heard women over and over
5569,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"again say they hoped the Princess May would be very happy with him, but"
5570,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,I never heard one say that she hoped the Duke would be very happy with
5571,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"the Princess May. Men said they hoped the pair would be very happy,"
5572,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,without naming one more than the other.
5573,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5574,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,I have touched briefly on all the more prominent female characters of
5575,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,the _Odyssey_. The moral in every case seems to be that man knows very
5576,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"little, and cannot be trusted not to make a fool of himself even about"
5577,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"the little that he does know, unless he has a woman at hand to tell him"
5578,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,what he ought to do. There is not a single case in which a man comes to
5579,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,the rescue of female beauty in distress; it is invariably the other way
5580,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,about.
5581,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5582,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,The only males who give Ulysses any help while he is on his wanderings
5583,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"are Æolus, who does him no real service and refuses to help him a"
5584,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"second time, and Mercury, who gives him the herb Moly (x. 305) to"
5585,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"protect him against the spells of Circe. In this last case, however, I"
5586,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,do not doubt that the writer was tempted by the lovely passage of _Il_.
5587,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"XXIV., where Mercury meets Priam to conduct him to the Achæan camp; one"
5588,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"pretty line, indeed (and rather more), of the Iliadic passage above"
5589,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,referred to is taken bodily by the writer of the _Odyssey_ to describe
5590,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"the youth and beauty of the god.[2] With these exceptions, throughout"
5591,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"the poem Andromeda rescues Perseus, not Perseus Andromeda--Christiana"
5592,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"is guide and guardian to Mr. Greatheart, not Mr. Greatheart to"
5593,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,Christiana.
5594,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5595,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,The case of Penelope may seem to be an exception. It may be urged that
5596,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Ulysses came to her rescue, and that the whole poem turns on his doing"
5597,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"so. But this is not true. Ulysses kills the suitors, firstly, because"
5598,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,they had wasted his substance--this from the first to last is the main
5599,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"grievance; secondly, because they had violated the female servants of"
5600,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"his house; and only, thirdly, because they had offered marriage to his"
5601,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,wife while he was still alive (xxii. 36-38). Never yet was woman better
5602,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"able to hold her own when she chose, and I will show at full length"
5603,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,shortly that when she did not hold it it was because she preferred not
5604,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,to do so.
5605,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5606,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,I have dealt so far with the writer's attitude towards women when in
5607,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,the world of the living. Let us now see what her instinct prompts her
5608,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,to consider most interesting in the kingdom of the dead. When Ulysses
5609,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"has reached the abode of Hades, the first ghost he meets is that of his"
5610,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"comrade Elpenor, who had got drunk and fallen off the roof of Circe's"
5611,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,house just as Ulysses and his men were about to set sail. We are
5612,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"expressly told that he was a person of no importance, being remarkable"
5613,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"neither for sense nor courage, so that it does not matter about killing"
5614,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"him, and it is transparent that the accident is only allowed to happen"
5615,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,in order to enable Ulysses to make his little joke when he greets the
5616,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,ghost in Hades to the effect that Elpenor has got there more quickly by
5617,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"land than Ulysses had done by water. Elpenor therefore, does not count."
5618,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5619,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"The order, however, in which the crowd of ghosts approach Ulysses,"
5620,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,is noticeable. After the blood of the victims sacrificed by Ulysses
5621,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"had flowed into the trench which he had dug to receive it, the writer"
5622,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,says:--
5623,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5624,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"""The ghosts came trooping up from Erebus--brides, young"
5625,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"bachelors, old men worn out with toil, maids who had"
5626,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"been crossed in love, and brave men who had been killed"
5627,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"in battle, with their armour still smirched with blood;"
5628,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"they came from every quarter, and flitted round the"
5629,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,trench with a strange kind of screaming sound that made
5630,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"me turn pale with fear"" (xi. 36-43)."
5631,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5632,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"I do not think a male writer would have put the brides first, nor yet"
5633,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,the young bachelors second. He would have begun with kings or great
5634,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"warriors or poets, nor do I believe he would make Ulysses turn pale"
5635,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,with fear merely because the ghosts screamed a little; they would have
5636,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,had to menace him more seriously.
5637,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5638,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,What does Bunyan do? When Christian tells Pliable what kind of company
5639,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"he will meet in Paradise, he says:--"
5640,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5641,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"""There we shall see elders with their golden crowns;"
5642,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,there we shall see holy virgins with their golden
5643,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,harps; there we shall see men that by the world were
5644,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"cut in pieces, burnt in flames, eaten of beasts,"
5645,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"drowned in the seas, for the love they bore to the Lord"
5646,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,of that place; all well and cloathed with immortality
5647,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"as with a garment."""
5648,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5649,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Men present themselves to him instinctively in the first instance,"
5650,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"and though he quits them for a moment, he returns to them immediately"
5651,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,without even recognising the existence of women among the martyrs.
5652,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5653,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Moreover, when Christian and Hopeful have passed through the river of"
5654,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"death and readied the eternal city, it is none but men who greet them."
5655,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5656,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"True, after having taken Christian to the Eternal City, Bunyan conducts"
5657,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Christiana also, and her children, in his Second Part; but surely if"
5658,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"he had been an inspired woman and not an inspired man, and if this"
5659,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"woman had been writing as it was borne in upon her by her own instinct,"
5660,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"neither aping man nor fearing him, she would have taken Christiana"
5661,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"first, and Christian, if she took him at all, in her appendix."
5662,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5663,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,Next to Elpenor the first ghost that Ulysses sees is that of his
5664,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"mother Anticlea, and he is sorely grieved that he may not, by Circe's"
5665,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"instructions, speak to her till he has heard what the Theban prophet"
5666,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Tiresias had got to tell him. As soon as he has heard this, he enquires"
5667,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"how he can make his mother recognise him, and converse with him. This"
5668,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,point being answered there follows the incomparably beautiful scene
5669,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"between him and Anticlea, which occupies some seventy or eighty lines,"
5670,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,and concludes by his mother's telling him to get home as fast as he
5671,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,can that he may tell of his adventures in Hades--to whom? To the world
5672,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,at large? To his kinsmen and countrymen? No: it is to his wife that he
5673,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"is to recount them and apparently to nobody else (xi. 223, 224). Very"
5674,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,right and proper; but more characteristic of a female than of a male
5675,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,writer.
5676,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5677,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,Who follow immediately on the departure of Anticlea? Proserpine sends
5678,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"up ""all the wives and daughters of great princes""--Tyro, daughter of"
5679,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Salmoneus, Antiope daughter of Asopus, Alcmena, Epicaste (better known"
5680,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"as Jocasta), Chloris wife of Neleus, Leda, Iphimedeia, Phædra, Procris,"
5681,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Ariadne, Mæra, Clymene, and Eriphyle. Ulysses says that there were many"
5682,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"more wives and daughters of heroes whom he conversed with, but that"
5683,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"time would not allow him to detail them further; in deference, however,"
5684,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"to the urgent request of King Alcinous, he goes on to say how he met"
5685,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Agamemnon, Achilles, and Ajax (who would not speak to him); he touched"
5686,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"lightly also on Minos, Orion, Tityus, Tantalus, Sisyphus, and Hercules."
5687,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5688,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,I have heard women say that nothing can be made out of the fact that
5689,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"the women in Hades are introduced before the men, inasmuch as they"
5690,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"would themselves have been more likely to put the men before the women,"
5691,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,and can understand that a male writer would be attracted in the first
5692,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"instance by the female shades. When women know what I am driving at,"
5693,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"they generally tell me this, but when I have got another woman to sound"
5694,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"them for me, or when I have stalked them warily, I find that they"
5695,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"would rather meet the Virgin Mary, Eve, Queen Elizabeth, Cleopatra,"
5696,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Sappho, Jane Austen, St. Elizabeth of Hungary, Helen of Troy, Zenobia,"
5697,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,and other great women than even Homer and Shakspeare. One comfortable
5698,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,homely woman with whom I had taken great pains said she could not think
5699,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"what I meant by asking such questions, but if I wanted to know, she"
5700,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,would as lief meet Mrs. Elizabeth Lazenby as Queen Elizabeth or any
5701,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"one of them. For my own part, had I to choose a number of shades whom"
5702,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"I would meet, I should include Sappho, Jane Austen, and the authoress"
5703,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"of the _Odyssey_ in my list, but I should probably ask first for Homer,"
5704,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Shakspeare, Handel, Schubert, Arcangelo Corelli, Purcell, Giovanni"
5705,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Bellini, Rembrandt, Holbein, De Hooghe, Donatello, Jean de Wespin and"
5706,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,many another man--yet the writer of the _Odyssey_ interests me so
5707,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,profoundly that I am not sure I should not ask to see her before any of
5708,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,the others.
5709,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5710,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,I know of no other women writers who have sent their heroes down
5711,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"to Hades, but when men have done so they deal with men first and"
5712,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,women afterwards. Let us turn to Dante. When Virgil tells him whom
5713,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Christ first saved when he descended into Hell, we find that he first"
5714,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"rescued Adam. Not a word is there about Eve. Then are rescued Abel,"
5715,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Noah, Abraham, David, Jacob and his sons--and lastly, just before"
5716,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"the _et ceteri_--one woman, Rachel. When Virgil has finished, Dante"
5717,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"begins meeting people on his own account. First come Homer, Horace,"
5718,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Ovid, and Lucan; when these have been disposed of we have Electra,"
5719,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Hector, Æneas, Cæsar, Camilla, Penthesilea, Latinus, Lavinia, Brutus,"
5720,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Cato's wife Marcia, Julia, Cornelia, Saladin, Socrates, Plato,"
5721,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Democritus, Diogenes, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Thales,"
5722,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Zeno, Dioscorides, Orpheus, Linus, Cicero, Seneca, Euclid, Ptolemy,"
5723,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Hippocrates, Galen, Avicen, and Averroes. Seven women to twenty-six"
5724,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"men. This list reminds me of Sir John Lubbock's hundred books, I shall"
5725,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,therefore pursue Dante no further; I have given it in full because I do
5726,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,not like him. So far as I can see the Italians themselves are beginning
5727,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"to have their doubts about him; ""Dante è un falso idolo,"" has been said"
5728,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,to me more than once lately by highly competent critics.
5729,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5730,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,Let us now look to the _Æneid_. When Æneas and the Sibyl approach the
5731,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"river Styx, we read:--"
5732,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5733,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,Hue omnis turba ad ripas effusa ruebat
5734,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Matres atque viri, defunctaque corpora vitâ"
5735,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Magnanimûm heroum, pueri, innuptæque puellæ,"
5736,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,Impositique rogis juvenes ante ora parentum.
5737,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5738,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,_Æn_. vi. 305-308.
5739,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5740,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"The women indeed come first, but the _i_ in _viri_ being short Virgil"
5741,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"could not help himself, and the first persons whom he recognises as"
5742,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"individuals are men--namely two of his captains who had been drowned,"
5743,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,Leucaspis and Orontes--and Palinurus. After crossing the Styx he first
5744,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,passes through the region inhabited by those who have died as infants;
5745,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,then that by those who have been unjustly condemned to die; then that
5746,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"by suicides; then that of those who have died for love, where he sees"
5747,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"several women, and among them Dido, who treats him as Ajax treated"
5748,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,Ulysses. The rest of those whom Æneas sees or converses with in Hades
5749,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,are all men.
5750,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5751,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Lucian is still more ungallant, for in his dialogues of the dead he"
5752,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,does not introduce a single woman.
5753,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5754,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,One other case alone occurs to me among the many that ought to do so; I
5755,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,refer to Fielding's _Journey to the next World_. The three first ghosts
5756,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,whom he speaks to in the coach are men. When he gets to his journey's
5757,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"end, after a short but most touching scene with his own little daughter"
5758,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"who had died a mere child only a few months before Fielding wrote, and"
5759,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"who is therefore nothing to the point, he continues: ""The first spirit"
5760,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"with whom I entered into discourse, was the famous Leonidas of Sparta."""
5761,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,Of course; soldier will greet soldier first. In the next paragraph
5762,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"one line is given to Sappho, who we are told was singing to the"
5763,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"accompaniment of Orpheus. Then we go on to Homer,[3] Virgil, Addison,"
5764,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Shakspeare, Betterton, Booth, and Milton."
5765,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5766,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Defoe, again, being an elderly married man, and wanting to comfort"
5767,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"Robinson Crusoe, can think of nothing better for him than the"
5768,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"companionship of another man, whereon he sends him Friday. A woman"
5769,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,would have sent him an amiable and good-looking white girl whom the
5770,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,cannibals had taken prisoner from some shipwrecked vessel. This she
5771,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,would have held as likely to be far more useful to him.
5772,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,
5773,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"So much to show that the mind of man, unless when he is young and"
5774,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"lovesick, turns more instinctively to man than to woman. And I am"
5775,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"convinced, as indeed every one else is whether he or she knows it"
5776,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"or no, that with the above exception, woman is more interested in"
5777,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"woman. This is how the Virgin Mary has come to be Queen of Heaven, and"
5778,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,practically of more importance than the Trinity itself in the eyes of
5779,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,the common people in Roman Catholic countries. For the women support
5780,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"the theologians more than the men do. The male Jews, again, so I am"
5781,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"told, have a prayer in which the men thank God that they were not born"
5782,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"women, and the women, that they were not born men. Each sex believes"
5783,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"most firmly in itself, nor till we have done away with individualism"
5784,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,altogether can we find the smallest reason to complain of this
5785,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,arrangement. A woman if she attempts an Epic is almost compelled to
5786,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"have a man for her central figure, but she will minimise him, and will"
5787,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,"maximise his wife and daughters, drawing them with subtler hand. That"
5788,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,the writer of the _Odyssey_ has done this is obvious; and this fact
5789,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,alone should make us incline strongly towards thinking that we are in
5790,THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMAN IN THE ODYSSEY.,the hands not of a man but of a woman.

5817,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5818,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5819,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,Not only does the writer shew a markedly greater both interest and
5820,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"knowledge when dealing with women, but she makes it plain that she"
5821,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"is exceedingly jealous for the honour of her sex, and by consequence"
5822,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,inexorable in her severity against those women who have disgraced it.
5823,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"Goddesses may do what they like, they are not to be judged by mortal"
5824,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,codes; but a mortal woman who has fallen must die.
5825,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5826,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,No woman throughout the _Odyssey_ is ever laughed at. Women may be
5827,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"hanged but they must not be laughed at. Men may be laughed at, indeed"
5828,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,Alcinous is hardly mentioned at all except to be made more or less
5829,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,ridiculous. One cannot say that Menelaus in Books iv. and xv. is being
5830,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"deliberately made ridiculous, but made ridiculous he certainly is, and"
5831,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,he is treated as a person of far less interest and importance than his
5832,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"wife is. Indeed Ulysses, Alcinous, Menelaus, and Nestor are all so like"
5833,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"one another that I do not doubt they were drawn from the same person,"
5834,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,just as Ithaca and Scheria are from the same place. Who that person was
5835,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,we shall never know; nevertheless I would point out that unless a girl
5836,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"adores her father he is generally, to her, a mysterious powerful being"
5837,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,whose ways are not as her ways. He is feared as a dark room is feared
5838,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"by children; and if his wife is at all given to laughing at him, his"
5839,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"daughter will not spare him, however much she may cajole and in a way"
5840,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,love him.
5841,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5842,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"But, as I have said, though men may be laughed at, the women are never"
5843,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"taken other than quite seriously. Venus is indeed, made a little"
5844,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"ridiculous in one passage, but she was a goddess, so it does not"
5845,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"matter; besides, the brunt of the ridicule was borne by Mars, and Venus"
5846,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,was instantly readorned and comforted by the Graces. I cannot remember
5847,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,a single instance of a woman's being made to do anything which she
5848,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"could not do without loss of dignity--I except, of course, slaves, and"
5849,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,am speaking of the higher social classes.
5850,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5851,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,It has often been observed that the Messenger of the Gods in the
5852,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"_Iliad_ is always Iris, while in the _Odyssey_ he is no less invariably"
5853,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,Mercury. I incline to attribute this to the author's dislike of the
5854,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,idea that so noble a lady as Iris should be made to fetch and carry
5855,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,for anybody. For it is evident Iris was still generally held to have
5856,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,been the messenger of the gods. This appears from the beginning of
5857,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"Book xviii., where we are told that Irus's real name was Arnæus, but"
5858,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,that he was called Irus (which is nothing but Iris with a masculine
5859,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"termination) ""because he used to carry messages when any one would send"
5860,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"him."" Writers do not fly in the face of current versions unless for"
5861,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,some special reasons of their own.
5862,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5863,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"If, however, a woman has misconducted herself she is to be shewn no"
5864,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"mercy. There are only three cases in point, and one of these hardly"
5865,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"counts inasmuch as the punishment of the guilty woman, Clytemnestra,"
5866,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"was not meted out to her by the authoress herself. The hold, however,"
5867,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"which the story of Clytemnestra's guilt has upon her, the manner"
5868,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"in which she repeatedly recurs to it, her horror at it, but at the"
5869,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,same time her desire to remove as much of the blame as possible
5870,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"from Clytemnestra's shoulders, convinces me that she acutely feels"
5871,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,the disgrace which Clytemnestra's treachery has inflicted upon all
5872,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"women ""even on the good ones."" Why should she be at such pains to"
5873,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,tell us that Clytemnestra was a person of good natural disposition
5874,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"(iii. 266), and was irreproachable until death had removed the bard"
5875,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,under whose protection Agamemnon had placed her?[1] When she was left
5876,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"alone--without either husband or guardian, and with an insidious wretch"
5877,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"like Ægisthus beguiling her with his incessant flattery, she yielded,"
5878,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"and there is no more to be said, except that it was very dreadful and"
5879,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,she must be abandoned to her fate. I see Mr. Gladstone has wondered
5880,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,what should have induced Homer (whom he holds to have written the
5881,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,_Odyssey_ as well as the _Iliad_) to tell us that Clytemnestra was a
5882,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"good woman to start with,[2] but with all my respect for his great"
5883,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"services to Homeric literature, I cannot think that he has hit upon"
5884,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"the right explanation. It should not be forgotten, moreover, that this"
5885,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,extenuation of Clytemnestra's guilt belongs to a part of the _Odyssey_
5886,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"that was engrafted on to the original design--a part in which, as I"
5887,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"shall show later, there was another woman's guilt, which was only not"
5888,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,extenuated because it was absolutely denied in the face of overwhelming
5889,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,evidence--I mean Penelope's.
5890,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5891,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,The second case in point is that of the woman who stole Eumæus when he
5892,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"was a child. A few days after she has done this, and has gone on board"
5893,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"the ship with the Phœnician traders, she is killed by Diana, and thrown"
5894,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,overboard to the seals and fishes (xv. 403-484).
5895,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5896,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,The third case is that of the women of Ulysses' household who had
5897,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,misconducted themselves with the suitors during his absence. We are
5898,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"told that there were fifty women servants in the house, of whom twelve"
5899,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,alone were guilty. It is curious that the number of servants should
5900,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,be exactly the same as that of the maidservants in the house of king
5901,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"Alcinous, and it should be also noted that twelve is a very small"
5902,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"number for the guilty servants, considering that there were over a"
5903,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"hundred suitors, and that the maids seem to have been able to leave"
5904,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"the house by night when they chose to do so (xx. 6-8)--true, we are"
5905,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,elsewhere told that the women had been violated and only yielded under
5906,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"compulsion, but this makes it more wonderful that they should be so"
5907,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"few--and I may add, more terribly severe to hang them. I think the"
5908,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,laxity of prehistoric times would have prompted a writer who was not
5909,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"particularly jealous for the honour of woman, to have said that there"
5910,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"were thirty-eight, or even more, guilty, and only twelve innocent. We"
5911,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,must bear in mind on the other hand that when Euryclea brought out the
5912,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,thirty-eight innocent women to see Ulysses after he had killed the
5913,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"suitors, Ulysses recognised them all (xxii. 501). The youngest of them"
5914,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"therefore can hardly have been under forty, and so me no doubt were"
5915,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,older--for Ulysses had been gone twenty years.
5916,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5917,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,Now how are the guilty ones treated? A man who was speaking of my
5918,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,theory that the _Odyssey_ was written by a woman as a mere _mauvaise
5919,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"plaisanterie_, once told me it was absurd, for the first thing a woman"
5920,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,would have thought of after the suitors had been killed was the dining
5921,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,room carpet. I said that _mutatis mutandis_ this was the very thing she
5922,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,did think of.
5923,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5924,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,As soon as Ulysses has satisfied himself that not a single suitor is
5925,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"left alive, he tells Euryclea to send him the guilty maidservants, and"
5926,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"on their arrival he says to Telemachus, Eumæus and Philœtius (xxii."
5927,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,437-443):--
5928,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5929,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"""Begin to bear away the corpses, and make the women help"
5930,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"you. When you have done this, sponge down the seats and"
5931,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"tables, till you have set the whole house in order; then"
5932,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,take the maids outside....and thrust them through with
5933,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"your swords."""
5934,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5935,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,These orders are faithfully obeyed; the maids help in the work of
5936,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,removing the bodies and they sponge the chairs and tables till they
5937,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,are clean--Ulysses standing over them and seeing that they lose no
5938,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"time. This done, Telemachus (whose mother, we are told (xxii. 426-427)"
5939,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,had never yet permitted him to give orders to the female servants)
5940,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"takes them outside and hangs them (xxii. 462), as a more dishonourable"
5941,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,death than the one his father had prescribed for them--perhaps also
5942,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,he may have thought he should have less blood to clean up than if he
5943,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,stabbed them--but see note on p. 98. The writer tells us in a line
5944,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"which she borrows in great part from the _Iliad_,[3] that their feet"
5945,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"move convulsively for a short time though not for very long, but her"
5946,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,ideas of the way in which Telemachus hanged them are of the vaguest.
5947,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,No commentator has ever yet been able to understand it; the only
5948,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"explanation seems to be that the writer did not understand it herself,"
5949,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,and did not care to do so. Let it suffice that the women were obviously
5950,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,hanged.
5951,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5952,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,No man writing in pre-Christian times would have considered the guilt
5953,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,of the women to require so horrible a punishment. He might have ordered
5954,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"them to be killed, but he would not have carried his indignation to"
5955,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,the point of making them first clean up the blood of their paramours.
5956,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"Fierce as the writer is against the suitors, she is far more so against"
5957,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"the women. When the suitors are all killed, Euryclea begins to raise a"
5958,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"cry of triumph over them, but Ulysses checks her. ""Hold your tongue,"
5959,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"woman,"" he says, ""it is ill bragging over the bodies of dead men"""
5960,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,(xxii. 411). So also it is ill getting the most hideous service out
5961,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,of women up to the very moment when they are to be executed; but the
5962,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,writer seems to have no sense of this; where female honour has been
5963,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"violated by those of woman's own sex, no punishment is too bad for them."
5964,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5965,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,The other chief characteristics of the _Odyssey_ which incline me
5966,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,to ascribe it to a woman are a kind of art for art's sake love of a
5967,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"small lie, and a determination to have things both ways whenever it"
5968,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,suits her purpose. This never seems to trouble her. There the story
5969,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"is, and the reader may take it or leave it. She loves flimsy disguises"
5970,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"and mystifications that stultify themselves, and mystify nobody. To"
5971,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"go no further than books i. and iii., Minerva in each of these tells"
5972,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"plausible stories full of circumstantial details, about her being on"
5973,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,her way to Temesa with a cargo of iron and how she meant to bring back
5974,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"copper (i. 184), and again how she was going to the Cauconians on the"
5975,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,following morning to recover a large debt that had been long owing to
5976,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"her (iii. 366), and then, before the lies she had been at such pains to"
5977,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,concoct are well out of her mouth she reveals herself by flying into
5978,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"the air in the form of an eagle. This, by the way, she could not well"
5979,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"do in either case if she was in a roofed hall, but might be conceived"
5980,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"as doing if, as I suppose her to have been in both cases, she was in a"
5981,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,roofed cloister that ran round an open court.
5982,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5983,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"There is a flavour of consecutive fifths in these flights,[4] if"
5984,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"indeed they are not downright octaves, and I cannot but think that"
5985,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,the writer would have found a smoother progression open to her if she
5986,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"had cared to look for one; but letting this pass, the way in which"
5987,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"white lies occur from the first book to the last, the punctiliousness,"
5988,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"omnipresent, with which small religious observances are insisted"
5989,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"upon, coupled with not a little unscrupulousness when these have been"
5990,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"attended to, the respect for gods and omens, and for the _convenances_"
5991,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,generally--all these seem to me to be more characteristic of a woman's
5992,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,writing than a man's.
5993,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
5994,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"The seriousness, again, with which Telemachus is taken, the closeness"
5995,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"with which he adheres to his programme, the precision with which"
5996,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"he invariably does what his father, his mother, Minerva, or any"
5997,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"responsible person tells him that he should do, except in one passage"
5998,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"which is taken almost _verbatim_ from the _Iliad_,[5] the way in"
5999,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,which Minerva beautifies him and preaches to him; the unobtrusive but
6000,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"exemplary manner in which he discharges all his religious, moral, and"
6001,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,social duties--all seem to me to point in the direction of thinking
6002,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,that the writer is a woman and a young one.
6003,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6004,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,How does Minerva preach to him? When he has washed his hands in the sea
6005,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,he prays that she will help him on his intended voyage in search of
6006,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,news concerning his father. The goddess then comes up to him disguised
6007,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"as Mentor, and speaks as follows:"
6008,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6009,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"""Telemachus, if you are made of the same stuff as your"
6010,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"father you will be neither fool or coward henceforward,"
6011,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half
6012,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"done. If, then, you take after him your voyage will not"
6013,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"be fruitless, but unless you have the blood of Ulysses"
6014,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,and Penelope in your veins I see no likelihood of your
6015,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men as their fathers;
6016,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"they are generally worse not better; still, as you are"
6017,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"not going to be either fool or coward henceforward, and"
6018,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,are not entirely without some share of your father's wise
6019,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"discernment, I look with hope upon your undertaking"" (ii."
6020,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,270-280).
6021,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6022,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,Hence the grandmotherly reputation which poor Mentor is never likely to
6023,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,lose. It was not Mentor but Minerva. The writer does not make Minerva
6024,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,say that daughters were rarely as good women as their mothers were. I
6025,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,had a very dear kind old aunt who when I was a boy used to talk to me
6026,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"just in this way. ""Unstable as water,"" she would say, ""thou shalt not"
6027,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"excel."" I almost heard her saying it (and more to the same effect) when"
6028,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,I was translating the passage above given. My uncles did not talk to me
6029,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,at all in the same way.
6030,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6031,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"I may add parenthetically here, but will deal with the subject more"
6032,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"fully in a later chapter, that all the time Minerva was lecturing"
6033,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,Telemachus she must have known that his going would be worse than
6034,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"useless, inasmuch as Ulysses was, by her own arrangements, on the"
6035,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,very eve of his return; and indeed he was back again in Ithaca before
6036,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,Telemachus got home.
6037,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6038,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"See, again, the manner in which Penelope scolds him in Book xviii. 215"
6039,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"&c., for having let Ulysses and Irus fight. She says:--"
6040,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6041,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"""Telemachus, I fear you are no longer so discreet and"
6042,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,well conducted as you used to be. When you were younger
6043,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"you had a greater sense of propriety; now, however,"
6044,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"that you are grown up, though a stranger to look at you"
6045,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,would take you for the son of a well-to-do father as far
6046,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"as size and good looks go, your conduct is by no means"
6047,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,what it should have been. What is all this disturbance
6048,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"that has been going on, and how came you to allow a"
6049,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,stranger to be so disgracefully ill-treated? What would
6050,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,have happened if he had suffered serious injury while a
6051,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,suppliant in our house? Surely this would have been very
6052,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"discreditable to you."""
6053,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6054,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,I do not believe any man could make a mother rebuke her son so
6055,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,femininely.
6056,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6057,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"Again, the fidelity with which people go on crying incessantly for a"
6058,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"son who has been lost to them for twenty years, though they have still"
6059,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"three sons left,[6] or for a brother whom they have never even seen,[7]"
6060,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"is part and parcel of that jealousy for the sanctity of domestic life,"
6061,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,in respect of which women are apt to be more exacting than men.
6062,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6063,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,And yet in spite of all this the writer makes Telemachus take no
6064,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,pains to hide the fact that his grievance is not so much the alleged
6065,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"ill-treatment of his mother, nor yet the death of his father, as the"
6066,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,hole which the extravagance of the suitors is making in his own pocket.
6067,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"When demanding assistance from his fellow countrymen, he says, of the"
6068,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,two great evils that have fallen upon his house:--
6069,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6070,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"""The first of these is the loss of my excellent father,"
6071,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,who was chief among all you here present and was like
6072,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,a father to every one of you. The second is much more
6073,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"serious, and ere long will be the utter ruin of my"
6074,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,estate. The sons of all the chief men among you are
6075,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,pestering my mother to marry them against her will. They
6076,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"are afraid to go to her father Icarius, asking him to"
6077,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriage"
6078,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"gifts for his daughter, but day after day they keep"
6079,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"hanging about my father's house, sacrificing our oxen,"
6080,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving"
6081,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink.
6082,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"No estate can stand such recklessness (ii. 46-48)."""
6083,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6084,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"Moreover it is clear throughout Books iii. and iv., in which Telemachus"
6085,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"is trying to get news of his father, that what he really wants is"
6086,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"evidence of his death, not of his being alive, though this may only"
6087,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,be because he despairs of the second alternative. The indignation
6088,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,of Telemachus on the score of the extravagance of the suitors is
6089,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,noticeably shared by the writer all through the poem; she is furious
6090,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,about it; perhaps by reason of the waste she saw going on in her
6091,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,father's house. Under all she says on this head we seem to feel the
6092,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"rankling of a private grievance, and it often crosses my mind that in"
6093,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,the suitors she also saw the neighbours who night after night came
6094,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"sponging on the reckless good nature of Alcinous, to the probable"
6095,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,eventual ruin of his house.
6096,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6097,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"Woman, religion, and money are the three dominant ideas in the mind"
6098,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,of the writer of the _Odyssey_. In the _Iliad_ the _belli causa_ is a
6099,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"woman, money is a detail, and man is most in evidence. In the _Odyssey_"
6100,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"the _belli causa_ is mainly money, and woman is most in evidence--often"
6101,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,when she does not appear to be so--just as in the books of the _Iliad_
6102,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,in which the Trojans are supposed to be most triumphant over the
6103,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"Achæans, it is the Trojans all the time whose slaughter is most dwelt"
6104,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,upon.
6105,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6106,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"It is strange that the _Odyssey_, in which money is so constantly"
6107,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"present to the mind of the writer, should show not even the faintest"
6108,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"signs of having been written from a business point of view, whereas the"
6109,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"_Iliad_, in which money appears but little, abounds with evidence of"
6110,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,its having been written to take with a certain audience whom the writer
6111,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,both disliked and despised--and hence of having been written with an
6112,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,eye to money.
6113,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6114,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"I will now proceed to the question whether Penelope is being, if I may"
6115,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"say so, whitewashed. Is the version of her conduct that is given us"
6116,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"in the _Odyssey_ the then current one, or is the writer manipulating"
6117,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"a very different story, and putting another face on it--as all poets"
6118,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"are apt to do with any story that they are re-telling? Tennyson, not"
6119,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"to mention many earlier writers, has done this with the _Arthurian"
6120,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"Legends_, the original form of which takes us into a moral atmosphere"
6121,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,as different as can well be conceived from the one we meet with in the
6122,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,_Idylls of the King_.
6123,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6124,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,There is no improbability (for other instances will occur to the reader
6125,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,so readily that I need not quote them) in the supposition that the
6126,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,writer of the _Odyssey_ might choose to recast a story which she deemed
6127,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"insulting to her sex, as well as disgusting in itself; the question"
6128,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"is, has she done so or not? Do traces of an earlier picture show up"
6129,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"through the one she has painted over it, so distinctly as to make it"
6130,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"obvious what the original picture represented? If they do not, I will"
6131,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"give up my case, but if they do, I shall hold it highly improbable that"
6132,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,a man in the Homeric age would undertake the impossible task of making
6133,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,Penelope at the same time plausible and virtuous. I am afraid I think
6134,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,he would be likely to make her out blacker than the last poet who had
6135,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"treated the subject, rather than be at any pains to whiten her."
6136,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,
6137,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,Least of all would Homer himself have been prompted to make Penelope
6138,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,out better than report says she was. He would not have cared whether
6139,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"she was better or worse. He is fond of women, but he is also fond of"
6140,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"teasing them, and he shows not the slightest signs of any jealousy for"
6141,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,"female honour, or of a desire to exalt women generally. He shows no"
6142,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,more sign of this than he does of the ferocity with which punishment
6143,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,is inflicted on the women of Ulysses' household--a ferocity which is
6144,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,in itself sufficient to make it inconceivable that the _Iliad_ and the
6145,WAYS--AND OF MONEY.,_Odyssey_ should be by the same person.

6202,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,
6203,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,One would have thought all she had to do was to bolt the doors as soon
6204,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"as the suitors had left for the night, and refuse to open them in the"
6205,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,morning; for the suitors never sleep in the same house with Penelope.

6214,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"bear this in mind, so we may take it as certain that it was modesty"
6215,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,and nothing else that made her hold up the veil. The suitors were not
6216,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"men of scrupulous delicacy, and in spite of their devotion to Penelope"
6217,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,lived on terms of improper intimacy with her women servants--none
6218,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,of whom appear to have been dismissed instantly on detection. It is
6219,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,a little strange that not one of those suitors who came from a long
6220,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"distance should have insisted on being found in bed as well as board,"
6221,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,and so much care is taken that not one breath of scandal should
6222,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"attach to Penelope, that we infer a sense on the writer's part that"
6223,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"it was necessary to put this care well in evidence. I cannot think,"
6224,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"for example, that Penelope would have been represented as nearly so"
6225,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"incredulous about the return of Ulysses in Book xxiii., if she had"
6226,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,been nearly as virtuous as the writer tries to make her out. The
6227,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,amount of caution with which she is credited is to some extent a gauge
6228,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,of the thickness of the coat of whitewash which the writer considers
6229,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,necessary. In all Penelope's devotion to her husband there is an ever
6230,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,present sense that the lady doth protest too much.
6231,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,
6232,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"Still stranger, however, is the fact that these ardent passionate"

6235,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"have had any place in their system. They show no signs of jealousy,"
6236,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"but jog along cheek by jowl as a very happy family, aiming spears at"

6249,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,mixture of perfect lover and perfect sponger is so impossible that no
6250,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,one could have recourse to it unless aware that he (or she) was in
6251,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,extreme difficulty. If men are in love they will not sponge; if they
6252,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,sponge they are not in love; we may have it either way but not both;

6267,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,Over and above this we may infer that the writer who can tell us such

6272,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"that she was still very young, and unmarried. At any rate the story"
6273,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,told above cannot have been written by Homer; if it is by a man at all
6274,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"it must be by some prehistoric Fra Angelico, who had known less in his"
6275,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"youth, or forgotten more in his old age, than the writer of the _Iliad_"
6276,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,is at all likely to have done. If he had still known enough to be able
6277,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"to write the _Odyssey_, he would have remembered more than the writer"
6278,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,of the _Odyssey_ shows any signs of having ever known.

6291,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"impossible, nor do I imagine that she would have asked us to accept it,"

6348,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,We cannot forget that when Telemachus first told Miranda about the

6364,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,successful when I wanted to get rid of people. There are indeed signs

6381,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,
6382,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,Telemachus in his rejoinder to the suitors does not deny a single one

6393,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,
6394,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,It was no doubt because Laertes saw what was going on that he went to

6396,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,and Penelope probably chose the particular form her work assumed in
6397,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,order to ensure that he should not come near her. Why could she not set
6398,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,about making a pall for somebody else? Was Laertes likely to continue

6404,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"As for Laertes being so badly off as Anticlea says he was in Book xi.,"
6405,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,there is not one grain of truth in that story. The writer had to make

6415,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,she was not going to let Penelope lose her presents. She evidently
6416,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"looks upon man as fair game, which male writers are much less apt to"

6433,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"in Laertes' hands, and the reason for his never coming to town now"
6434,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"was partly, no doubt, the pall; partly the scandalous life which his"

6464,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"broke out, and that he must now be grown up (xi. 448, 449)."
6465,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,
6466,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,The silence therefore of Ulysses' mother is wilful so far as the writer
6467,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,is concerned. She must have conceived of Anticlea as knowing all about
6468,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"the suitors perfectly well--for she did not die till Telemachus was,"
6469,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"by her own account, old enough to be a magistrate. The explanation"
6470,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"I believe to be, that at the time Book xi. was written, the writer"
6471,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"had as yet no intention of adding Books i.-iv., and from line 187"
6472,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,of Book xiii. to Book xxiv. but proposed to ignore the current
6473,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"scandalous stories about Penelope, and to say as little as possible"
6474,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,about her. I will deal with this more fully when I come to the genesis
6475,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"and development of the poem, but may as well say at once that the"
6476,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,difficulty above pointed out will have to remain unexplained except as
6477,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,a slip in chronology on the part of a young writer who was piecing new
6478,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,work on to old. Any one but the writer herself would have seen it and
6479,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,"avoided it; indeed it is quite possible that she came to see it, and"
6480,ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO PENELOPE IS BEING WHITEWASHED.,did not think it worth her while to be at the trouble of altering it.

6496,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6497,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6498,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,The question whether or no the writer of the _Odyssey_ is putting
6499,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,her own construction on grosser versions of Penelope's conduct
6500,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"current among her countrymen, has such an important bearing on that"
6501,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"of the writer's sex, that I shall bring further evidence to show"
6502,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,how impossible she finds it to conceal the fact that those who knew
6503,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,Penelope best had no confidence in her.
6504,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6505,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"Minerva with quick womanly instinct took in the situation at a glance,"
6506,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,and went straight to the point. On learning from Telemachus that
6507,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"Penelope did not at once say she would not marry again, she wastes no"
6508,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"words, but says promptly, ""If your mother's mind is set on marrying"
6509,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"again"" (and surely this implies that the speaker had no doubt that"
6510,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"it was so set) ""let her go back to her father"" (i. 276). From this"
6511,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,we may infer that Minerva had not only formed her own opinion about
6512,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"Penelope's intentions, but saw also that she meant taking her time"
6513,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"about the courtship, and was not likely to be brought to the point by"
6514,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,any measures less decisive than sending her back to her father's house.
6515,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6516,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"We know, moreover, what Minerva thought of Penelope from another"
6517,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,source. Minerva appears to Telemachus in a dream when he is staying
6518,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"with King Menelaus, and gives him to understand that his mother is on"
6519,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"the point of marrying Eurymachus, one of the suitors (xv. 1-42). This"
6520,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,was (so at least we are intended to suppose) a wanton falsehood on
6521,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"Minerva's part. Nevertheless if the matter had ended there, nothing"
6522,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,probably would have pleased Telemachus better; for in spite of his
6523,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"calling the marriage ""hateful,"" there can be no question that he would"
6524,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"have been only too thankful to get his mother out of the house, if"
6525,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,she would go of her own free will. Penelope says he was continually
6526,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"urging her to marry and go, on the score of the expense he was being"
6527,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,put to by the protracted attentions of the suitors (xix. 530-534).
6528,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,Penelope indeed seems to have been such an adept at lying that it is
6529,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"very difficult to know when to believe her, but Telemachus says enough"
6530,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"elsewhere to leave no doubt that, in spite of a certain decent show of"
6531,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"reluctance, he would have been glad that his mother should go."
6532,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6533,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,Unfortunately Minerva's story does not end with saying that Penelope
6534,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,means marrying Eurymachus; she adds that in this case she will probably
6535,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,steal some of Telemachus's property. She says to him:--
6536,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6537,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"""You know what women are; they always want to do the"
6538,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,best they can for the man who is married to them at
6539,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,the moment. They forget all about their first husband
6540,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"and the children that they have had by him. Go home,"
6541,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"therefore, at once, and put everything in charge of the"
6542,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"most respectable housekeeper you can find, until it shall"
6543,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"please heaven to send you a wife of your own"" (xv. 20-26)."
6544,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6545,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,This passage not only betrays a want of confidence in Penelope which
6546,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"is out of keeping with her ostensible antecedents, but it goes far to"
6547,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"show that Minerva had read the _Cypria_, in which poem (now lost) we"
6548,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,are told that Helen did exactly what is here represented as likely to
6549,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"be done by Penelope; but leaving this, surely if Penelope's antecedents"
6550,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"had been such as the writer wishes us to accept, Telemachus would have"
6551,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,made a very different answer to the one he actually made. He would have
6552,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"said, ""My dear Minerva, what a word has escaped the boundary of your"
6553,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,teeth. My mother steal my property and go off with an unprincipled
6554,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,scoundrel like Eurymachus? No one can know better than yourself that
6555,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"she is the last woman in the world to be capable of such conduct."" And"
6556,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,then he would have awoke as from a hideous dream.
6557,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6558,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"What, however, happens in reality? Telemachus does indeed wake up (xv."
6559,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"43) in great distress, but it is about his property, not about his"
6560,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"mother. ""Who steals my mother steals trash, but whoso filches from me"
6561,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"my family heirlooms &c."" He kicks poor Pisistratus to wake him, and"
6562,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,says they must harness the horses and be off home at once. Pisistratus
6563,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,rejoins that it is pitch dark; come what may they must really wait
6564,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"till morning. Besides, they ought to say good bye to Menelaus, and get"
6565,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"a present out of him; he will be sure to give them one, if Telemachus"
6566,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,will not be in such an unreasonable hurry. Can anything show more
6567,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,clearly what was the inner mind both of Minerva and Telemachus about
6568,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,Penelope--and also what kind of ideas the audience had formed about her?
6569,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6570,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"How differently, again, do Minerva and Telemachus regard the stealing."
6571,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,Telemachus feels it acutely and at once. Minerva takes it as a matter
6572,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,of course--but then the property was not hers. The authoress of the
6573,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,_Odyssey_ is never severe about theft. Minerva evidently thinks it
6574,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,not nice of Penelope to want to marry again before it is known for
6575,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"certain that Ulysses is dead, but she explains that Eurymachus has been"
6576,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"exceeding all the other suitors in the magnificence of his presents,"
6577,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"and has lately increased them (xv. 17, 18). After all, Penelope had"
6578,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"a right to please herself, and as long as she was going to be _bonâ"
6579,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"fide_ married, she might steal as much as she could, without loss of"
6580,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,dignity or character. The writer put this view into Minerva's mouth as
6581,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"a reasonable one for a woman to take. So perhaps it was, but it is not"
6582,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,a man's view.
6583,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6584,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"Here I will close my case--as much of it, that is to say, as I have"
6585,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,been able to give in the space at my disposal--for the view that
6586,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"the writer of the _Odyssey_ was whitewashing Penelope. As, however,"
6587,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,we happen to be at Lacedæmon let me say what more occurs to me in
6588,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,connection with the visit of Telemachus to King Menelaus that bears on
6589,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,the question whether the writer is a man or a woman.
6590,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6591,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,When Telemachus and Nestor's son Pisistratus reached Lacedæmon at the
6592,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"beginning of Book iv., Menelaus was celebrating the double marriage of"
6593,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,his son Megapenthes and of his daughter Hermione. The writer says:--
6594,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6595,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"....they reached the low lying city of Lacedæmon, where"
6596,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"they drove straight to the abode of Menelaus, [and found"
6597,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,him in his own house feasting with his many clansmen in
6598,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"honour of the wedding of his son, and also that of his"
6599,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,daughter whom he was giving in marriage to the son of
6600,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,that valiant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent
6601,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"and promised her to him while he was still at Troy, and"
6602,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"now the gods were bringing the marriage about, so he was"
6603,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,sending her with chariots and horses to the city of the
6604,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,Myrmidons over whom Achilles' son was reigning. For his
6605,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"only son he had found a bride from Sparta, the daughter"
6606,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"of Alector. This son, Megapenthes, was born to him of"
6607,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"a bondwoman, for heaven had vouchsafed Helen no more"
6608,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,children after she had borne Hermione who was fair as
6609,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,golden Venus herself (iv. 1-14).]
6610,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6611,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,I have enclosed part of the above quotation in brackets not because I
6612,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,have any doubt that the whole of it is by the same hand as the rest
6613,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"of the poem, but because I am convinced that the bracketed lines were"
6614,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"interpolated by the writer after her work had been completed, or at"
6615,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,any rate after Books iv. and xv. had assumed their present shape. The
6616,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,reason for the interpolation I take to be that she could not forgive
6617,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"herself for having said nothing about Hermione, whose non-appearance"
6618,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,in Book xv. and in the rest of Book iv. she now attempts to explain
6619,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"by interpolating the passage above quoted, and thus making her quit"
6620,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,Lacedæmon for good and all at the very beginning of this last named
6621,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"book. But whatever the cause of the interpolation may have been, an"
6622,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"interpolation it certainly is, for nothing can be plainer from the rest"
6623,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"of Book iv. than that there were no festivities going on, and that the"
6624,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,only guests were uninvited ones--to wit Telemachus and Pisistratus.
6625,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6626,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"True, the writer tried to cobble the matter by introducing lines"
6627,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"621-624, which in our texts are always inclosed in brackets as"
6628,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"suspected--I suppose because Aristarchus marked them with _obeli_,"
6629,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"though he did not venture to exclude them. The cobble, however, only"
6630,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"makes things worse, for it is obviously inadequate, and its abruptness"
6631,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,puzzles the reader.
6632,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6633,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"Accepting, then, lines 2-19 and 621-624 of Book iv. as by the writer"
6634,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"of the rest of the poem, the reader will note how far more interesting"
6635,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,she finds the marriage of Hermione than that of Megapenthes--of whose
6636,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"bride, by the way, there is no trace in Book xv. The marriage of the"
6637,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,son is indeed mentioned in the first instance before that of the
6638,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,daughter; but surely this is only because υἱέος ἠδὲ θυγατρός lends
6639,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,itself more readily to a hexameter verse than any transposition of
6640,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,the nouns would do. Having mentioned that both son and daughter are to
6641,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"be married, the writer at once turns to Hermione, and appears only to"
6642,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"marry Megapenthes because, as his sister is being married, he may as"
6643,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,well be married too. A male writer would have married Megapenthes first
6644,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,and Hermione afterwards; nor would he have thought it worth while to
6645,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,make a very awkward interpolation in his poem merely in order to bring
6646,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"Hermione into it, for by this time she must have been over thirty, and"
6647,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,it would have been easy to suppose that she had been married years ago
6648,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,during Menelaus's absence.
6649,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6650,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"As regards the second and shorter interpolation (iv. 621-624), it"
6651,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"refers to the day after the pretended marriages, and runs as follows:--"
6652,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6653,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,Thus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the
6654,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"king's house. They brought sheep and wine, while their"
6655,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,wives had put up bread for them to take with them. So
6656,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,they were busy cooking their dinners in the courts.]
6657,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6658,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,Passing over the fact that on such a great occasion as the marriage of
6659,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"his son and daughter, Menelaus would hardly expect his guests to bring"
6660,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,their own provisions with them (though he might expect them as Alcinous
6661,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,did[1] to do their own cooking) I would ask the reader to note that the
6662,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,writer cannot keep the women out even from a mere cobble. A man might
6663,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"have told us that the guests brought meat and wine and bread, but his"
6664,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,mind would not instinctively turn to the guests' wives putting up the
6665,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,bread for them.
6666,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6667,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,I say nothing about the discrepancy between the chronology of
6668,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"Telemachus's visit to Sparta, and of Ulysses' journey from the island"
6669,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,of Calypso to Ithaca where he arrives one day before Telemachus does.
6670,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,The reader will find it dwelt on in Colonel Mure's _Language and
6671,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"Literature of Ancient Greece_, Vol. I., pp. 439, 440. I regard it as"
6672,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,nothing more than a slip on the part of a writer who felt that such
6673,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,slips are matters of very small importance; but I will call attention
6674,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,to the manner in which the gorgeousness of Menelaus's establishment
6675,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"as described in Book iv. has collapsed by the time we reach Book xv.,"
6676,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,though as far as I can determine the length of Telemachus's stay with
6677,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"Menelaus, the interval between the two books should not exceed one"
6678,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,entire day.
6679,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6680,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"When Telemachus has informed Menelaus that he must go home at once,"
6681,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,Menelaus presses his guests to stay and have something to eat before
6682,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"they start; this, he tells them, will be not only more proper and more"
6683,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"comfortable for them, but also cheaper."
6684,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6685,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,We know from _Il_. VII. 470-475 that Menelaus used to sell wine when
6686,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"he was before Troy, as also did Agamemnon, but there is a frank"
6687,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,_bourgoisie_ about this invitation which a male writer would have
6688,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"avoided. Still franker, however, is the offer of Menelaus to take them"
6689,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,on a personally conducted tour round the Peloponesus. It will be very
6690,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"profitable, for no one will send them away empty handed; every one will"
6691,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"give them either a bronze tripod or a cauldron, or two mules, or a gold"
6692,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,chalice (xv. 75-85). As for the refreshments which they are to have
6693,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"immediately, the king explains that they will have to take potluck, but"
6694,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"says he will tell the women to see that there is enough for them, of"
6695,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,what there might happen to be in the house.
6696,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6697,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,That is just like Menelaus's usual fussiness. Why could he not have
6698,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,left it all to Helen? After reading the _Odyssey_ I am not surprised
6699,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,at her having run away with Paris; the only wonder is that a second
6700,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,great war did not become necessary very shortly after the Trojan matter
6701,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,had been ended. Surely the fact that two young bachelors were going to
6702,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,stay and dine was not such a frightful discord but that it might have
6703,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"been taken unprepared, or at any rate without the monarch's personal"

6705,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,that the dinner is not going to be profusely sumptuous. If there did
6706,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,not happen to be anything good in the house--and I suspect this to
6707,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,have been the case--Menelaus should have trusted Helen to send out
6708,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,and get something. But there should have been no sending out about
6709,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,it; Menelaus and Helen ought never to have had a meal without every
6710,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,conceivable delicacy.

6712,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"What a come down, again, is there not as regards the butler Eteoneus."
6713,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,He was not a real butler at all--he was only a kind of char-butler;
6714,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"he did not sleep in the house (xv. 96), and for aught we know may"
6715,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,have combined a shop round the corner with his position in Menelaus'
6716,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"household. Worse than this, he had no footman, not even a boy, under"
6717,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"him, for Menelaus tells him to light the fire and set about cooking"
6718,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"dinner (xv. 97, 98), which he proceeds to do without one syllable of"
6719,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,remonstrance. What has become of Asphaliou? Where are the men servants
6720,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,who attended to Telemachus and Pisistratus on their arrival? They
6721,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,have to yoke their own horses now. The upper and under women servants
6722,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"who appear at all Odyssean meals are here as usual, but we hear"
6723,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"nothing more of Adraste, Alcippe, and Phylo. It seems as though after"
6724,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,describing the splendour of Menelaus's house in Book iv. the writer's
6725,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"nerve has failed her, and by Book xv. her instinctive thrift has"
6726,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,re-asserted itself.
6727,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6728,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"And now let me return, as I said in Chapter IV. that I intended doing,"
6729,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,to the very singular--for I do not like to say feminine--nature of
6730,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,the arrangements made by Minerva for her protégé in the matter of his
6731,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,voyage to Pylos and Lacedæmon.
6732,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6733,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"When Minerva first suggested it to him, she knew that Ulysses was on"
6734,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"the point of starting from Calypso's island for Scheria, and would"
6735,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,be back in Ithaca almost immediately. Yet she must needs choose
6736,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"this particular moment, of all others, for sending Telemachus on a"
6737,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,perilons voyage in quest of news concerning him. We have seen how she
6738,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,preached to him; but surely if Telemachus had known that she was all
6739,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"the time doing her very utmost to make his voyage useless, he might"
6740,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,have retorted with some justice that whether he was going to be a
6741,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"fool henceforward or no, he should not make such a fool of any young"
6742,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"friend of his own as she was now making of himself. Besides, he was to"
6743,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"be away, if necessary, for twelve months; yet here before he has been"
6744,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"gone more than four or five days, Minerva fills him with an agony of"
6745,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,apprehension about his property and sends him post haste back to Ithaca
6746,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,again.
6747,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6748,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"The authoress seems to have felt the force of this, for in xiii."

6751,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6752,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"""Why did you not tell him, for you know all about it? Did you want him,"

6755,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,
6756,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"Minerva answered, ""Do not trouble yourself about him. I sent him that"

6766,JOURNEY OF TELEMACHUS TO LACEDÆMON.,"""You stupid man, can you not understand that my poetess"

6810,--AND UNMARRIED.,
6811,--AND UNMARRIED.,"I will now touch briefly on the principal passages, over and above"
6812,--AND UNMARRIED.,large general considerations and the details to which I have already
6813,--AND UNMARRIED.,"called attention, which seem to me to suggest a woman's hand rather"
6814,--AND UNMARRIED.,"than a man's. I shall omit countless more doubtful instances, many of"
6815,--AND UNMARRIED.,"which the reader will have noted, or easily discover."
6816,--AND UNMARRIED.,
6817,--AND UNMARRIED.,At the very outset of the poem (i. 13) the writer represents Ulysses as
6818,--AND UNMARRIED.,"longing to get back to his wife. He had stayed a whole year with Circe,"
6819,--AND UNMARRIED.,and but for the remonstrances of his men would have stayed no one can
6820,--AND UNMARRIED.,"say how much longer. He had stayed seven years with Calypso, and seems"
6821,--AND UNMARRIED.,to have remained on excellent terms with her until the exigencies of
6822,--AND UNMARRIED.,the poem made it necessary to send him back to Ithaca. Surely a man of
6823,--AND UNMARRIED.,"his sagacity might have subtracted Calypso's axe and auger, cut down"
6824,--AND UNMARRIED.,"the trees at the far end of the island, and made his raft years ago"
6825,--AND UNMARRIED.,without her finding out anything about it; for she can hardly have
6826,--AND UNMARRIED.,wanted either axe or auger very often.
6827,--AND UNMARRIED.,
6828,--AND UNMARRIED.,"As for the provisions, if Ulysses was not capable of accumulating a"
6829,--AND UNMARRIED.,"private hoard, his cunning has been much overrated. If he had seriously"
6830,--AND UNMARRIED.,wanted to get back to Penelope his little cunning that is put in
6831,--AND UNMARRIED.,"evidence would have been exercised in this direction. I am convinced,"
6832,--AND UNMARRIED.,"therefore, that though the authoress chooses to pretend that Ulysses"
6833,--AND UNMARRIED.,"was dying to get back to Penelope, she knew perfectly well that he"
6834,--AND UNMARRIED.,"was in no great hurry to do so; she was not, however, going to admit"
6835,--AND UNMARRIED.,"anything so derogatory to the sanctity of married life, or at any rate"
6836,--AND UNMARRIED.,to the power which a wife has over her husband.

6840,--AND UNMARRIED.,An older woman might have been at less pains to conceal the fact that
6841,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Penelope's hold on Ulysses was in reality very slight, but the writer"
6842,--AND UNMARRIED.,"of the _Odyssey_ is nothing if she is not young, self-willed, and"
6843,--AND UNMARRIED.,unmarried. No matron would set herself down to write the _Odyssey_ at
6844,--AND UNMARRIED.,"all. She would have too much sense, and too little daring. She would"
6845,--AND UNMARRIED.,have gained too much--and lost too greatly in the gaining. The poem is
6846,--AND UNMARRIED.,"such a _tour de force_ as none but a high-spirited, headstrong girl"
6847,--AND UNMARRIED.,"who had been accustomed to have her own way would have attempted, much"
6848,--AND UNMARRIED.,"less carried to such a brilliantly successful conclusion; I cannot,"
6849,--AND UNMARRIED.,"therefore, conceive the writer as older than the original of the"
6850,--AND UNMARRIED.,frontispiece at the beginning of this book--if indeed she was so old.

6854,--AND UNMARRIED.,The very beautiful lines in which the old nurse Euryclea lights
6855,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Telemachus to bed, and folds up his clothes for him (i. 428-442),"
6856,--AND UNMARRIED.,suggest a woman's hand rather than a man's. So also does the
6857,--AND UNMARRIED.,emphasising Laertes' respect for his wife's feelings (i. 430-433).
6858,--AND UNMARRIED.,This jealousy for a wife's rights suggests a writer who was bent
6859,--AND UNMARRIED.,"on purifying her age, and upholding a higher ideal as regards the"
6860,--AND UNMARRIED.,relations between husband and wife than a man in the Homeric age would
6861,--AND UNMARRIED.,be likely to insist on.

6865,--AND UNMARRIED.,"The price paid for Euryclea (i. 431) is, I do not doubt, a rejoinder"
6866,--AND UNMARRIED.,"to the Iliadic insults of XXIII. 262-264, in which a woman and a"
6867,--AND UNMARRIED.,"tripod are put up in one lot as a prize, and also of XXIII. 702-705,"
6868,--AND UNMARRIED.,"in which a tripod is represented as worth twelve oxen, and a good"
6869,--AND UNMARRIED.,serviceable maid of all work only four oxen. A matron would have let
6870,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Homer's passage severely alone, and a man would not have resented it so"
6871,--AND UNMARRIED.,strongly as to make him write at it by declaring Euryclea to have been
6872,--AND UNMARRIED.,bought for twenty oxen.

6876,--AND UNMARRIED.,An Iliadic passage of some length is interrupted (iii. 448-455) for
6877,--AND UNMARRIED.,"the purpose of bringing in Nestor's wife and daughters, and describing"
6878,--AND UNMARRIED.,their delight at seeing a heifer killed; the Iliadic passage is then
6879,--AND UNMARRIED.,"resumed. A man, or older woman, once launched on an Iliadic passage"
6880,--AND UNMARRIED.,would have stuck to it till it failed them. They would not have cared
6881,--AND UNMARRIED.,whether the ladies of Nestor's household liked seeing the heifer killed
6882,--AND UNMARRIED.,or no.

6886,--AND UNMARRIED.,When Helen mixes Nepenthe with the wine which was to be handed round
6887,--AND UNMARRIED.,"to Menelaus, Telemachus, and Pisistratus, we learn its virtues to be"
6888,--AND UNMARRIED.,so powerful that a man could not weep during all the day on which he
6889,--AND UNMARRIED.,"had drunk it, not even though he had lost both his father and his"
6890,--AND UNMARRIED.,"mother, or had seen a brother or a son cut to pieces before his eyes"
6891,--AND UNMARRIED.,(iv. 220-226). From the order in which these relationships present
6892,--AND UNMARRIED.,themselves to the writer's mind I opine that her father and mother were
6893,--AND UNMARRIED.,"the most important persons in her world, and hence that she was still"
6894,--AND UNMARRIED.,young and unmarried.

6898,--AND UNMARRIED.,A little lower we find Helen more or less penitent for having run away
6899,--AND UNMARRIED.,"with Paris. Helen was Jove's own daughter, and therefore had a right to"
6900,--AND UNMARRIED.,do pretty much as she chose; still it was held better to redeem her as
6901,--AND UNMARRIED.,"far as possible, by making her more or less contrite. The contrition,"
6902,--AND UNMARRIED.,"however, is of a very curious kind. It was Venus, it seems, who ought"
6903,--AND UNMARRIED.,to be penitent for having done Helen so great a wrong. It is the wrong
6904,--AND UNMARRIED.,"that has been done to her that she laments, rather than any misdoing of"
6905,--AND UNMARRIED.,her own.

6911,--AND UNMARRIED.,"who were inside, and mimick the voices of their wives (iv. 274-279)?"
6912,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Ulysses must have told her that the horse was coming, and what it would"
6913,--AND UNMARRIED.,"contain, when he entered Troy in disguise and talked with her. A man"
6914,--AND UNMARRIED.,"might have made Helen walk round the horse, pat it, and even call out"

6922,--AND UNMARRIED.,by getting Idothea to put some scent under each man's nostrils (iv.
6923,--AND UNMARRIED.,"441-446). There is, however, an _arrière pensée_ here to which I will"
6924,--AND UNMARRIED.,call attention later (see Chapter XII. near the end). Very daughterly
6925,--AND UNMARRIED.,also is the pleasure which Idothea evidently feels in playing a trick

6945,--AND UNMARRIED.,he would ascribe it to a young unmarried woman without a moment's
6946,--AND UNMARRIED.,hesitation. Let the reader note how Nausicaa has to keep her father up
6947,--AND UNMARRIED.,"to having a clean shirt on when he ought to have one (vi. 60), whereas"
6948,--AND UNMARRIED.,her younger brothers appear to keep her up to having one for them when
6949,--AND UNMARRIED.,they want one. These little touches suggest drawing from life by a

6955,--AND UNMARRIED.,"without knowledge of what men commonly feel on such points, having by a"
6956,--AND UNMARRIED.,"cruel freak of fortune got her hero into such an awkward predicament,"
6957,--AND UNMARRIED.,might conceivably imagine that he would argue as the writer of the
6958,--AND UNMARRIED.,"_Odyssey_ has made Ulysses do, but no man, except such a woman's tailor"

6993,--AND UNMARRIED.,The love of her own home and parents which is so obvious throughout
6994,--AND UNMARRIED.,the poem is never more apparent than in the speech of Ulysses (ix.
6995,--AND UNMARRIED.,34-36). He says that however fine a house a man may have in a foreign
6996,--AND UNMARRIED.,"land, he can never be really happy away from his father and mother. How"
6997,--AND UNMARRIED.,different this from the saying which Aristophanes puts into the mouth
6998,--AND UNMARRIED.,of Mercury (_Plut_. 1151) to the effect that a man's fatherland is any
6999,--AND UNMARRIED.,"place in which he is making money; or again from Euripides, who in a"
7000,--AND UNMARRIED.,fragment of _Phaethon_ says that a man's fatherland is any land that
7001,--AND UNMARRIED.,will feed him. It is only a young and affectionate girl who could have
7002,--AND UNMARRIED.,made Ulysses (who is not much given to sentiment) speak so warmly.
7003,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Middle-aged people, whether men or women, are too much spotted with the"

7029,--AND UNMARRIED.,drawn from life. I have often fancied that the whole Cyclops incident
7030,--AND UNMARRIED.,"may have been suggested by one of those _merende_, or pic-nics which"
7031,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Italians and Sicilians are still so fond of, and that the writer of the"
7032,--AND UNMARRIED.,_Odyssey_ went with her friends to Pizzolungo and the cave where the
7033,--AND UNMARRIED.,"scene is laid, which was then really much what an _alpe_ is now--an"
7034,--AND UNMARRIED.,abode of shepherds who made cheese in the cave itself. I like to fancy
7035,--AND UNMARRIED.,(for I know that it is nothing more than fancy) that the writer of the
7036,--AND UNMARRIED.,"_Odyssey_ was delighted with all she saw, but that as she was looking"
7037,--AND UNMARRIED.,at the milk dishes some huge unkempt shepherd came in with a load of
7038,--AND UNMARRIED.,"firewood on his back, and gave a sudden shock to her nervous system"
7039,--AND UNMARRIED.,by flinging it down too violently. Him she transformed into the local
7040,--AND UNMARRIED.,giant that exists on Mt. Eryx now under the name of Conturràno.[1]

7044,--AND UNMARRIED.,It is very hard to say what the authoress thought that Polyphemus did
7045,--AND UNMARRIED.,in the matter of his ewes and lambs. The lambs were in the yards all
7046,--AND UNMARRIED.,"day, for Ulysses' men saw them there and wanted to steal them (ix. 226,"
7047,--AND UNMARRIED.,"227). Besides, Polyphemus could not have got any milk from the ewes if"
7048,--AND UNMARRIED.,their lambs had been with them in the day-time. Having driven the ewes
7049,--AND UNMARRIED.,"into his cave (I omit the she-goats for brevity) he milked them, and"
7050,--AND UNMARRIED.,"then put their lambs with them (ix. 245). The question is, did he take"
7051,--AND UNMARRIED.,"them away again after they had got what they could from a milked ewe,"
7052,--AND UNMARRIED.,or did he leave them with their mothers all night?
7053,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7054,--AND UNMARRIED.,"On the one hand we have no hint of their removal, which would be a"
7055,--AND UNMARRIED.,long and troublesome task; on the other we are told in line 309 that
7056,--AND UNMARRIED.,"he milked the ewes in the morning, and again gave each one of them her"
7057,--AND UNMARRIED.,lamb; on the evening of the same day he repeats this process (line
7058,--AND UNMARRIED.,"342), and he could hardly give the ewes their lambs unless he had first"
7059,--AND UNMARRIED.,removed them.
7060,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7061,--AND UNMARRIED.,The difficulty is that if he removed them they would certainly die in
7062,--AND UNMARRIED.,"a very few days of such diet as Polyphemus allows them, for whatever"
7063,--AND UNMARRIED.,"he did was κατὰ μοῖραν, according to his usual practice; while if he"
7064,--AND UNMARRIED.,"did not remove them, he could not have got any milk. Whatever he did,"
7065,--AND UNMARRIED.,"we may be sure that the writer of the _Odyssey_ had got it wrong, and"
7066,--AND UNMARRIED.,"there is not much to be gained by trying to find out what she thought,"
7067,--AND UNMARRIED.,for it is obvious that she did not think.
7068,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7069,--AND UNMARRIED.,"I asked my friend, Sigr. Giuseppe Pagoto of Mt. Eryx, what was the"
7070,--AND UNMARRIED.,"practise of Sicilian shepherds now, and received the following answer:--"
7071,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7072,--AND UNMARRIED.,In Sicily they do not milk ewes that have lately lambed; they keep the
7073,--AND UNMARRIED.,lambs shut up and take the ewes to feed. In the evening they let the
7074,--AND UNMARRIED.,"lambs suck, and then shut them up again. During the night the ewes"
7075,--AND UNMARRIED.,"make a great deal of milk, and this is again sucked by the lambs in"
7076,--AND UNMARRIED.,"the morning, and not milked. Our shepherds do not take any of the milk"
7077,--AND UNMARRIED.,until the lamb has been killed. Perhaps in those days the pastures
7078,--AND UNMARRIED.,"were so abundant that the ewes gave milk enough to nourish the lambs,"
7079,--AND UNMARRIED.,and still have some for milking. This is the only way in which what
7080,--AND UNMARRIED.,Polyphemus did can be explained.
7081,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7082,--AND UNMARRIED.,I believe the true explanation to be that the shepherd from whose
7083,--AND UNMARRIED.,"_alpe_ the scene was in part drawn, drove in a number of ewes some of"
7084,--AND UNMARRIED.,"which had lambs, while the lambs of others had been already killed and"
7085,--AND UNMARRIED.,"eaten. The authoress saw the shepherd milk a number of ewes, and then"
7086,--AND UNMARRIED.,"bring in a number of lambs, but she did not understand that the ewes"
7087,--AND UNMARRIED.,"which had been milked had got no lambs, while those that had lambs"
7088,--AND UNMARRIED.,still living had not been milked. I think she knew she was hazy about
7089,--AND UNMARRIED.,"it, otherwise she would not have cut her version short with a πάντα"

7094,--AND UNMARRIED.,"It being evident that Circe is quite as capable a prophet as Tiresias,"
7095,--AND UNMARRIED.,why should poor Ulysses be sent down to Hades? Obviously because the
7096,--AND UNMARRIED.,writer had set her heart on introducing colloquies with the dead.
7097,--AND UNMARRIED.,Granted; but a writer who was less desirous of making out that women
7098,--AND UNMARRIED.,know as much as men would not have made Circe know quite so much.

7104,--AND UNMARRIED.,that her information was deficient? Ulysses does not appear to have

7129,--AND UNMARRIED.,The present from Helen to Telemachus of a wedding dress (xv. 125-129)
7130,--AND UNMARRIED.,was more likely to occur to a young woman than to a man. I think also
7131,--AND UNMARRIED.,"that a male writer would have given something to poor Pisistratus, who"
7132,--AND UNMARRIED.,has been very good and amiable all through. It does not appear that
7133,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Telemachus tipped Eteoneus or any other of Menelaus' servants, though"
7134,--AND UNMARRIED.,"from xx. 296, 297 it is plain that it was quite usual for visitors to"
7135,--AND UNMARRIED.,give something to the servants of a house at which they were staying.
7136,--AND UNMARRIED.,"He is very rude about not saying good-bye to Nestor (xv. 199-201), and"
7137,--AND UNMARRIED.,he never says good-bye to Pisistratus as he ought.
7138,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7139,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Ulysses, again, seems to have no sense of obligation whatever to Circe"
7140,--AND UNMARRIED.,or Calypso. He has no other idea than that of taking as much and giving
7141,--AND UNMARRIED.,"as little as he can. So, in Hades he does not begin by asking how"
7142,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Penelope is, but how she is behaving, and whether she is protecting his"
7143,--AND UNMARRIED.,"estate (xi. 177, &c.)."
7144,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7145,--AND UNMARRIED.,"In Book xvii. 495 the old nurse and housekeeper, who has hitherto"
7146,--AND UNMARRIED.,"always been Euryclea, suddenly becomes Eurynome, a name which we have"
7147,--AND UNMARRIED.,"not yet had. Eurynome from this point is frequently mentioned, though"
7148,--AND UNMARRIED.,"the context always suggests, and sometimes compels, the belief that"
7149,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Euryclea is intended. In Book xx. 4, for example, we are told that"
7150,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Eurynome threw a cloak over Ulysses after he had lain down to rest, but"
7151,--AND UNMARRIED.,"in line 143 of the same Book, Euryclea says she threw the cloak over"
7152,--AND UNMARRIED.,"him herself--for surely this is intended, though the plural according"
7153,--AND UNMARRIED.,to very common custom is used instead of the singular. The alternation
7154,--AND UNMARRIED.,"of the two names becomes very baffling, till finally in Book xxiii."
7155,--AND UNMARRIED.,"289-293 both Eurynome and Euryclea appear on the scene together, which"
7156,--AND UNMARRIED.,"cobbles the difficulty, but does not make a good job of it--for one"
7157,--AND UNMARRIED.,woman would have been quite enough to do all that there was to do.
7158,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7159,--AND UNMARRIED.,"What happened, I take it, was this. In the first line where we meet"
7160,--AND UNMARRIED.,"with Eurynome, the name Euryclea could not be made to scan very easily,"
7161,--AND UNMARRIED.,"and the writer, thinking she would alter it later, wrote Eurynome."
7162,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Having done so once, she used the names Eurynome and Euryclea according"
7163,--AND UNMARRIED.,"as metrical convenience inspired her. This went on for some time,"
7164,--AND UNMARRIED.,till in the end she found it would be a great deal of trouble to
7165,--AND UNMARRIED.,re-write all the passages in which Eurynome had appeared; she therefore
7166,--AND UNMARRIED.,"determined to brazen it out, and pretend that she had all along meant"
7167,--AND UNMARRIED.,Euryclea and Eurynome to be two people. To put their separate existence
7168,--AND UNMARRIED.,"beyond question, she brings them both on together. I do not say that"
7169,--AND UNMARRIED.,"this is feminine, but I can find nothing like it in the _Iliad_. I have"
7170,--AND UNMARRIED.,"sometimes thought the last six or seven Books, though they contain"
7171,--AND UNMARRIED.,"some of the most exquisite passages in the whole poem, were written in"
7172,--AND UNMARRIED.,"greater haste than the earlier ones, while the last hundred lines or so"
7173,--AND UNMARRIED.,of Book xxiv. suggest that the writer was determined to end her work
7174,--AND UNMARRIED.,without much caring how. I have also wondered whether the husband who
7175,--AND UNMARRIED.,in Book vi. was yet to find may not have been found before Book xxiv.
7176,--AND UNMARRIED.,was written; but I have nothing to urge in support of this speculation.

7180,--AND UNMARRIED.,Argus (xvii. 292) is not a very good name for a dog. It is the

7183,--AND UNMARRIED.,most disappointing in the _Odyssey_. If the dog was too old or feeble
7184,--AND UNMARRIED.,"to come to Ulysses, Ulysses should have gone up to him and hugged"
7185,--AND UNMARRIED.,him--fleas or no fleas; and Argus should not have been allowed to die
7186,--AND UNMARRIED.,"till this had been put in evidence. True, Ulysses does wipe away one"
7187,--AND UNMARRIED.,"tear, but he should have broken utterly down--and then to ask Eumæus"
7188,--AND UNMARRIED.,"whether Argus was any use, or whether he was only a show dog--this will"
7189,--AND UNMARRIED.,not do even as acting. The scene is well conceived but badly executed;

7212,--AND UNMARRIED.,"which Ulysses' leg made, and the upsetting of a bath full of water,"

7224,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Ulysses is on the point of returning, the more imperative Penelope"
7225,--AND UNMARRIED.,finds it to marry one of the suitors without a day's delay. She has
7226,--AND UNMARRIED.,heard about the hawk tearing the dove; she has heard Telemachus sneeze;
7227,--AND UNMARRIED.,"she has been assured that Ulysses was among the Thesprotians, quite"
7228,--AND UNMARRIED.,"near, and would be in Ithaca immediately; she has had a dream which"

7235,--AND UNMARRIED.,A woman who felt herself really drowning would have clutched at any one

7237,--AND UNMARRIED.,months; and any writer who had known real sorrow would also know how

7273,--AND UNMARRIED.,"my own hypothesis the heads had been taken off the handles, but they"

7293,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7294,--AND UNMARRIED.,The killing of the suitors is aggressive in its want of plausibility.
7295,--AND UNMARRIED.,"If Melanthius could go to the store-room, no matter how, the other"
7296,--AND UNMARRIED.,suitors could have followed him and attacked Ulysses from behind; for
7297,--AND UNMARRIED.,there is evidently a passage from the store-room to the place where
7298,--AND UNMARRIED.,Ulysses is standing.
7299,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7300,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Again, the outer yard was open to the suitors all the time. Surely with"
7301,--AND UNMARRIED.,the axes still at command they could have cut the Byblus-fibre rope
7302,--AND UNMARRIED.,that was the only fastening of the main gate; some of them at any rate
7303,--AND UNMARRIED.,might have got out. The first ninety lines of the Book are as fine as
7304,--AND UNMARRIED.,"the _Iliad_, but from line (say) 100 to line 330 the writer is out"
7305,--AND UNMARRIED.,"of her depth, and knows it. The most palpably feminine part is where"
7306,--AND UNMARRIED.,Minerva comes to help Ulysses disguised as Mentor (xxii. 205-240). The
7307,--AND UNMARRIED.,"suitors menace her, and in a rage she scolds not them but Ulysses,"
7308,--AND UNMARRIED.,"whom she rates roundly. Having done this, she flies away and sits on a"
7309,--AND UNMARRIED.,rafter like a swallow.
7310,--AND UNMARRIED.,

7312,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7313,--AND UNMARRIED.,"All readers will help poets, playwrights, and novelists, by making"
7314,--AND UNMARRIED.,"believe a good deal, but we like to know whether we are in the hands"
7315,--AND UNMARRIED.,"of one who will flog us uphill, or who will make as little demand upon"
7316,--AND UNMARRIED.,us as possible. In this portion of Book xxii. the writer is flogging
7317,--AND UNMARRIED.,us uphill. She does not care how much she may afflict the reader in
7318,--AND UNMARRIED.,his efforts to believe her--the only thing she really cares for is her
7319,--AND UNMARRIED.,"revenge. She must have every one of the suitors killed stone dead, and"
7320,--AND UNMARRIED.,"all the guilty women hanged, and Melanthius first horribly tortured"
7321,--AND UNMARRIED.,"and then cut in pieces. Provided these objects are attained, it is not"
7322,--AND UNMARRIED.,"necessary that the reader should be able to believe, or even follow,"
7323,--AND UNMARRIED.,all the ins and outs of the processes that lead up to them.
7324,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7325,--AND UNMARRIED.,I will therefore not pursue the absurdities with which the killing of
7326,--AND UNMARRIED.,"the suitors abounds. I would, however, point out that in Book xvi. 281,"
7327,--AND UNMARRIED.,"&c., where the taking away of the armour from the cloister walls was"
7328,--AND UNMARRIED.,"first mooted, it was proposed that enough to arm Ulysses and Telemachus"
7329,--AND UNMARRIED.,"should be left accessible, so that they might snatch it up in a moment"
7330,--AND UNMARRIED.,"without having to go all the way down into the store-room after it,"
7331,--AND UNMARRIED.,at the risk of Telemachus's forgetting to shut the door--as young
7332,--AND UNMARRIED.,people so often do. I suppose Ulysses forgot all about this sensible
7333,--AND UNMARRIED.,"precaution, when he and Telemachus were hiding the armour at the"
7334,--AND UNMARRIED.,beginning of Book xix. Or shall we suppose that the idea of catching
7335,--AND UNMARRIED.,Melanthius in the store-room had not occurred to the poetess when she
7336,--AND UNMARRIED.,"was writing Book xvi., but had struck her before she reached Book xix.,"
7337,--AND UNMARRIED.,"and that she either forgot, or did not think it worth while, or found"
7338,--AND UNMARRIED.,"it inconvenient, to cancel lines 295, 296 of Book xvi.? From what I"
7339,--AND UNMARRIED.,"have seen of the authoress I incline to this last opinion, and hold"
7340,--AND UNMARRIED.,that she made Ulysses omit to leave a little of the armour accessible
7341,--AND UNMARRIED.,"to himself and Telemachus, because she had by this time determined to"
7342,--AND UNMARRIED.,"string Melanthius up in the store-room, and did not see how to get"
7343,--AND UNMARRIED.,him inside it unless she made Telemachus go there first and leave the
7344,--AND UNMARRIED.,"door open; and, again, did not see how to get Telemachus down to the"
7345,--AND UNMARRIED.,"store-room if she left armour near at hand, for him to snatch up."
7346,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7347,--AND UNMARRIED.,"As for Telemachus bringing up four helmets, four shields, eight spears,"
7348,--AND UNMARRIED.,"he was already fully armed when the fight began (xxi. 434), so three"
7349,--AND UNMARRIED.,"helmets, three shields and six spears should have done. Four helmets,"
7350,--AND UNMARRIED.,"four shields, and eight spears is a heavy load; but Melanthius carried"
7351,--AND UNMARRIED.,"twelve shields, twelve helmets, and twelve spears apparently all at one"
7352,--AND UNMARRIED.,time.
7353,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7354,--AND UNMARRIED.,*       *       *       *       *
7355,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7356,--AND UNMARRIED.,"We are in an atmosphere of transpontine melodrama, but the only wonder"
7357,--AND UNMARRIED.,"is that the absurdities are not even grosser than they are, seeing that"
7358,--AND UNMARRIED.,the writer was a young woman with a strong will of her own. Woman she
7359,--AND UNMARRIED.,must have been; no male writer could have resisted the temptation to
7360,--AND UNMARRIED.,kill Eumæus. It is the faithful servant's rôle to be mortally wounded
7361,--AND UNMARRIED.,on occasions of this sort. There are very few more suitors to be
7362,--AND UNMARRIED.,"killed, and Minerva is going to raise her ægis immediately, so that"
7363,--AND UNMARRIED.,he could be perfectly well spared; possibly the writer felt that she
7364,--AND UNMARRIED.,should be shorthanded with the cleaning up of the blood and the removal
7365,--AND UNMARRIED.,"of the dead bodies, but more probably she hated the suitors so bitterly"
7366,--AND UNMARRIED.,that she would not let them score a single point.

7370,--AND UNMARRIED.,"How evidently relieved she feels when she has got the killing over,"
7371,--AND UNMARRIED.,"and can return to ground on which she is strong, such as the saving of"
7372,--AND UNMARRIED.,"Phemius and Medon, and the cleaning down of the house."

7375,--AND UNMARRIED.,
7376,--AND UNMARRIED.,"What are we to say of making Penelope, whose room looked out upon the"
7377,--AND UNMARRIED.,"cloister, sleep soundly all through the killing of the suitors? What of"
7378,--AND UNMARRIED.,"her remarks to Euryclea when she has been waked? What, again, of her"
7379,--AND UNMARRIED.,"interview with Ulysses, and the dance which Ulysses presently advises?"
7380,--AND UNMARRIED.,"what, indeed, of the whole Book? Surely it is all perfectly right as"
7381,--AND UNMARRIED.,"coining from some such person as the one portrayed in my frontispiece,"
7382,--AND UNMARRIED.,but who can conceive the kind of man or matron who could write it?
7383,--AND UNMARRIED.,The same applies to Book xxiv. What man or middle-aged woman could
7384,--AND UNMARRIED.,have written the ineffably lovely scene between Ulysses and Laertes
7385,--AND UNMARRIED.,"in the garden? or have made Ulysses eat along with Dolius, whose son"
7386,--AND UNMARRIED.,and daughter he had killed on the preceding day? A man would have been
7387,--AND UNMARRIED.,"certain to make Ulysses tell Dolius that he was very sorry, but there"
7388,--AND UNMARRIED.,had been nothing for it but to hang his daughter and to cut his son's
7389,--AND UNMARRIED.,"nose and ears off, draw out his vitals, and then cut off his hands and"
7390,--AND UNMARRIED.,"feet. Probably, however, he would have kept Dolius and his sons out of"
7391,--AND UNMARRIED.,the Book altogether.

7412,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7413,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"I have now given, though far more briefly than the subject requires,"
7414,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,some of my reasons for believing that from the first Book of the
7415,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"_Odyssey_ to the last we are in the hands of a young woman. Who,"
7416,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"then, was she? Where did she live and write? She was of flesh and"
7417,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"blood, lived in time and place, looked on sea and sky, came and went"
7418,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"somewhither and somewhen--but where? and when? and above all, who? It"
7419,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,will be my object to throw what light I can upon these subjects in the
7420,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,following chapters.
7421,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7422,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"I will follow the same course that I have taken earlier, and retrace"
7423,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the steps whereby I was led to my conclusions.
7424,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7425,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,By the time I had finished Book x. I was satisfied that the _Odyssey_
7426,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"was not a man's work, but I had seen nothing to make me think that"
7427,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"it was written rather at one place than at another. When, however, I"
7428,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"reached xiii. 159-164, in which passage Neptune turns the Phæacian ship"
7429,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"into a rock at the entrance of the Scherian harbour, I felt sure that"
7430,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"an actual feature was being drawn from, and made a note that no place,"
7431,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"however much it might lie between two harbours, would do for Scheria,"
7432,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,unless at the end of one of them there was a small half sunken rock.
7433,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Presently I set myself to consider what combination of natural features
7434,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"I ought to look for on the supposition that Scheria was a real place,"
7435,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,and made a list of them as follows:--
7436,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7437,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,1. The town must be placed on a point of land jutting out as a land's
7438,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"end into the sea between two harbours, or bays in which ships could"
7439,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,ride (vi. 263); it must be connected with the mainland by a narrow neck
7440,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"of land, and as I have just said, must have a half sunken formidable"
7441,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,rock at the entrance of one of the harbours.
7442,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7443,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"2. There must be no river running into either harbour, or Nausicaa"
7444,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,would not have had to go so far to wash her clothes. The river when
7445,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,reached might be nothing but a lagoon with a spring or two of fresh
7446,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"water running into it, for the clothes were not, so it would seem,"
7447,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,washed in a river; they were washed in public washing cisterns (_Od_.
7448,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"vi. 40, 86, 92) which a small spring would keep full enough of water"
7449,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""to wash clothes even though they were very dirty."" The scene is laid"
7450,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"close on the sea shore, for the clothes are put out to dry on a high"
7451,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"bank of shingle which the sea had raised, and Nausicaa's maidens fly"
7452,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,from Ulysses along the beach and spits that run into the sea.
7453,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7454,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,3. There must be a notable mountain at no great distance from the town
7455,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,so as to give point to Neptune's threat that he would bury it under a
7456,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"high mountain. Furthermore, the whole combination above described must"
7457,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"lie greatly further west of Eubœa than Ithaca was, and hence greatly"
7458,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"west of Ithaca (vii. 321). Surely, if a real place is being drawn from,"
7459,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,these indications are ample to ensure its being easily found.
7460,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7461,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Men of science, so far as I have observed them, are apt in their"
7462,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,fear of jumping to a conclusion to forget that there is such a thing
7463,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"as jumping away from one, and Homeric scholars seem to have taken a"
7464,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,leaf out of their book in this respect. How many striking points of
7465,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"correspondence, I wonder, between an actual place and one described"
7466,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"in a novel, would be enough to create a reasonable assurance that"
7467,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the place in which they were combined was the one that was drawn
7468,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,from? I should say four well marked ones would be sufficient to
7469,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,make it extremely improbable that a like combination could be found
7470,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"elsewhere; make it five, and unless we find something to outweigh the"
7471,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,considerations which so close a correspondence between the actual place
7472,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"and the one described in the novel would suggest, or unless by some"
7473,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,strange coincidence the same combination in all its details can be
7474,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"shown to occur in some other and more probable locality, we may be sure"
7475,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,that the novel was drawn from the place; for every fresh detail in the
7476,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,combination required decreases the probability of error in geometrical
7477,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,ratio if it be duly complied with.
7478,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7479,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Let us suppose that a policeman is told to look out for an elderly
7480,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"gentleman of about sixty; he is a foreigner, speaks a little English"
7481,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"but not much, is lame in his left foot, has blue eyes, a bottle nose,"
7482,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,and is about 5 ft. 10 in. high. How many of these features will the
7483,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,policeman require before he feels pretty sure that he has found his
7484,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,man? If he sees any foreigner he will look at him. If he sees one who
7485,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"is about 5 ft. 10 in. high he will note his age, if this proves to be"
7486,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"about sixty years, and further, if the man limps on his left foot, he"
7487,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"will probably feel safe in stopping him. If, as he is sure to do, he"
7488,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"finds he has a bottle nose, he will leave the blue eyes and broken"
7489,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"English alone, and will bring the man before the magistrate."
7490,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7491,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"If it is then found that the man's eyes are hazel, and that he"
7492,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,either speaks English fluently or does not speak it at all--is the
7493,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,magistrate likely to discharge the prisoner on account of these small
7494,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"discrepancies between him and the description given of him, when so"
7495,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,many other of the required characteristics are found present? Will he
7496,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,not rather require the prisoner to bring forward very convincing proof
7497,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,that it is a case of mistaken identity?
7498,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7499,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Or to take another illustration, which is perhaps more strictly to the"
7500,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,point as involving comparison between an actual place and one described
7501,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,in a novel. Here is an extract from a novel:--
7502,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7503,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Grammerton, like other fair cities, was built on a hill."
7504,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"The highest point was the fine old Elizabethan School,"
7505,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"then, and now, of European reputation. Opposite it was"
7506,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"the old shattered and ruined castle, overlooking the"
7507,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,bubbling and boiling shallows of the broad and rapid
7508,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,river Saber.... From the hill the town sloped rapidly
7509,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"down on every side towards the river, which made it a"
7510,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"peninsula studded with habitations. (_The Beaucleres,"
7511,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"father and son_, by Charles Clarke, Chapman and Hall."
7512,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Vol. I. p. 28.)
7513,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7514,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Is there any man of ordinary intelligence and acquainted with
7515,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Shrewsbury who will doubt that Shrewsbury was the place that Mr. Clarke
7516,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,was drawing from?
7517,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7518,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,When I have urged the much more numerous and weightier points of
7519,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"agreement between Scheria as described in the _Odyssey_, and Trapani"
7520,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"as it still exists, eminent Homeric scholars have told me, not once"
7521,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"nor twice--and not meekly, but with an air as though they were crushing"
7522,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,me--that my case rests in the main on geographical features that are
7523,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"not unknown to other parts of the coast, and upon legends which also"
7524,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,belong to other places.
7525,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7526,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Grammerton, they argue--to return to my illustration--must not be held"
7527,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"as Shrewsbury, for at Harrow as well as Shrewsbury the School is on the"
7528,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"highest part of the town. There is a river, again, at Eton, so that"
7529,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Eton may very well have been the place intended. It is highly fanciful
7530,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,to suppose that the name Saber may have been a mere literary travesty
7531,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,of Sabrina. At Nottingham there is a castle which was in ruins but a
7532,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"few years since, and from which one can see the Trent. Nottingham,"
7533,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"therefore, is quite as likely to be the original of Grammerton as"
7534,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Shrewsbury is.
7535,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7536,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,And so on _ad infinitum_. This line of argument consists in ignoring
7537,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,that the force of the one opposed to it lies in the demonstrable
7538,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"existence of a highly complex combination, the component items of which"
7539,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"are potent when they are all found in the same place, but impotent"
7540,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,unless combined. It is a line which eminent Homeric scholars almost
7541,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"invariably take when discussing my Odyssean theory, but it is not"
7542,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,one which will satisfy those before whom even the most eminent of
7543,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Homeric scholars must in the end bow--I mean, men of ordinary common"
7544,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,sense. These last will know that Grammerton can only be dislodged from
7545,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Shrewsbury on proof either that the features of Shrewsbury do not in
7546,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"reality correspond with those of Grammerton, or else that there is"
7547,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"another town in England which offers the same combination, and is"
7548,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,otherwise more acceptable.
7549,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7550,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,So with Trapani and Scheria. Eminent Homeric scholars must show that
7551,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,I have exaggerated the points of correspondence between the two
7552,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,places--which in the face of Admiralty charts and of the _Odyssey_
7553,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,they will hardly venture; or they must bring forward some other place
7554,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,in which the same points of correspondence are found combined--which
7555,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,they will not attempt; or they must show reason for thinking that the
7556,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,very numerous and precise correspondences between Trapani and all
7557,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Scherian and Ithacan scenes are referable to mere accident--and this
7558,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,will satisfy those only who will believe that a man has held thirteen
7559,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"trumps in his hand three deals running, without having tampered with"
7560,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"the cards. I need not discuss this last supposition, and as for the"
7561,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"other two, I can only assure the reader that no attempt has been made"
7562,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,to establish either of them during the close on six years since my
7563,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,theory was first put before the public.
7564,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7565,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Neither will it ever be made. For Scheria should be looked for on some
7566,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"West coast to the West of Greece, and there are no such West coasts"
7567,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"except those of Italy and Sicily, both of which I know well enough to"
7568,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,be sure that if the Scherian combination could be found elsewhere than
7569,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,at Trapani I should long since have found it. Even could such a place
7570,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"be found with its rock Malconsiglio, legend and all, before it could"
7571,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,compete with Trapani in claiming the _Odyssey_ it would have to offer
7572,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the Ithacan combination as well as the Scherian; for surely a place
7573,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,which provides us with both Ithacan and Scherian topography would have
7574,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,a greater right to be considered as that from which the _Odyssey_ was
7575,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"drawn, than one which could only offer the details of Scheria."
7576,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7577,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Furthermore, could they find another place with all both Scherian and"
7578,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Ithacan features, my opponents would be only half way through their"
7579,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"troubles; for Trapani could still hold its own against it, unless it"
7580,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"also had four islands (neither more nor fewer) lying off it, one of"
7581,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"them long and narrow, and all of them corresponding with the inaccurate"
7582,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Odyssean description of the Ionian islands. Nor would it even then
7583,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"begin to be on equal terms with Trapani, till it was shown that the"
7584,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,effective part of the voyages of Ulysses begins and ends with it. When
7585,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"all this has been done, but not before, it will be time to weigh the"
7586,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,comparative claims of the two sites.
7587,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7588,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,For I rest my case on the harmonious concurrence of four lines of
7589,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"argument, each requiring the fulfilment of many and very rigorous"
7590,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"conditions, and each by itself sufficient to raise a strong presumption"
7591,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,that Trapani was the place which was most prominent in the mind of the
7592,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,writer of the _Odyssey_. They are:--
7593,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7594,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,1. That Scheria is drawn from Trapani. This I will substantiate by
7595,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,bringing forward a much stronger combination of correspondences than
7596,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,exists between Grammerton and Shrewsbury.
7597,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7598,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,2. That Ithaca also is drawn from Trapani and its immediate
7599,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,neighbourhood. My case for this will be found even stronger if possible
7600,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,than that by which I established that Scheria was Trapani.
7601,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7602,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,3. That the Ionian islands as described in the _Odyssey_ cannot have
7603,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"been drawn from the actual Ionian islands, nor from any others but"
7604,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,those off Trapani; and that the writer sinned against her own knowledge
7605,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,in order to force these islands into her narrative.
7606,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7607,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,4. That the voyages of Ulysses practically resolve themselves into a
7608,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"voyage from Troy to the neighbourhood of Sicily, and thenceforward into"
7609,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"a sail round Sicily, beginning with Trapani and ending with the same"
7610,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,place.
7611,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7612,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,It will be necessary that no argument adduced in support of any of
7613,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"these propositions should clash with those in support of any other,"
7614,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"but all the four lines of argument must corroborate each other, so"
7615,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,that they fit into one another as the pieces of a child's puzzle.
7616,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,It is inconceivable that anything but a true theory should comply
7617,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,with conditions so exacting. I will now proceed to show that Scheria
7618,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"is Trapani, and will return to the steps by which I arrived at this"
7619,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,conclusion.
7620,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7621,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Armed with the list of points I had to find in combination, as given"
7622,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"at the beginning of this chapter, I went down to the map room of the"
7623,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,British Museum intending to search the Mediterranean from the Troad
7624,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,to Gibraltar if necessary; but remembering that I ought to look (for
7625,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"reasons already given) some distance West of Greece, and also that"
7626,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the writer of the _Odyssey_ appeared to have lived on a coast that
7627,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"looked West not East, I resolved to search the West coasts first. I"
7628,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,knew that Colonel Mure and a respectable weight of ancient testimony
7629,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"had placed the Cyclopes on Mt. Eryx, and it seemed to me that the"
7630,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"island where Ulysses hunted the goats, and the whole Cyclopes incident"
7631,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,suggested drawing from life more vividly than any other part of the
7632,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"voyages. I knew, moreover, that the writer was a young woman who"
7633,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"was little likely to have travelled, and hence felt sure that if one"
7634,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"place could be found, none of the others would be long in finding; I"
7635,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"asked, therefore, for the map of the Lilybæan promontory, as the West"
7636,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"coast West of Greece that offered the greatest prospect of success,"
7637,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,and hardly had I got it in my hand before I found the combination I
7638,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,wanted for Scheria lying right under Mt. Eryx. The land's end jutting
7639,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,into the sea--the two harbours one on either side of it--the narrow
7640,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,entrance between two marshes--the high mountain hard by--the rock at
7641,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the entrance of one of the harbours--the absence of any river--will be
7642,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"found in the map here given, which Messrs. Walker & Boutall have made"
7643,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"for me from the Italian Government survey, and from our own Admiralty"
7644,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,chart.
7645,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7646,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,[Illustration: TRAPANI AND MT. ERYX--_Walker & Boutall sc_.]
7647,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7648,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"But this was not all. Not only was the rock of the right height, and"
7649,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"so turned as to give the idea of a ship coming into port, but it it"
7650,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"bore the strange name of Malconsiglio, or ""Evil counsel."" I was so"
7651,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,much struck with this that I wrote to Trapani enquiring whether there
7652,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"existed any local tradition in connection with the rock, and was told"
7653,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"that there were two--the one absurd, and the other to the effect that"
7654,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the rock had been a ship of Turkish Pirates who were coming to attack
7655,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Trapani, but were turned into stone at the entrance of the harbour"
7656,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,by the Madonna di Trapani. I did not doubt that the name and the
7657,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"legend between them preserved the Odyssean version, in a Christianised"
7658,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,form--the legend recording the fact of a ship's having been turned into
7659,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"stone as it was entering harbour, and the name telling us the other"
7660,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,fact that this had been brought about in consequence of an evil counsel.
7661,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7662,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,I believe the above sufficient for reasonable assurance that Scheria
7663,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"was drawn from Trapani, and will, therefore, proceed to establish that"
7664,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the Ithaca scenes are drawn also from the same place and its immediate
7665,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,neighbourhood.
7666,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7667,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"To this end it will be incumbent upon me to find that near Trapani,"
7668,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"though not actually at the town, there exists, or can be shown to have"
7669,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"in all reasonable probability existed, a harbour which has, or had,"
7670,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"a current in it, and which lies hard by the foot of a mountain. This"
7671,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"harbour should have a shelving bottom, for the Phæacian crew which"
7672,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,brought Ulysses to Ithaca ran half the ship's length on shore before
7673,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the way was off it. At no great distance there must be two caves
7674,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,near together (xiii. 103-112 and 347-349). One of them must have two
7675,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"entrances--one turned towards the North, by which people can go down"
7676,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"into the cave, and the other towards the South, by which the gods alone"
7677,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"can enter. It must have water in it, and also prehistoric implements"
7678,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,should be found there. From near it one must be able to see harbours
7679,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"(in the plural), and it should be on the side of a mountain. Here"
7680,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Ulysses hid the treasures that the Phæacians had given him. The other
7681,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,cave need present no special features.
7682,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7683,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"A man ascending the mountain from these caves, and keeping along the"
7684,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,top of it should come to a place on ground commanding an extensive
7685,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"prospect, where there is a spring and a rock that is called Raven. This"
7686,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"site must be bitterly cold in winter, and must be about two hours'"
7687,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,walk from Trapani; the path to the town must be so rugged that a man
7688,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,in ordinary vigour would not like to take it without having a stick;
7689,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"and lastly, it must pass a notable mound or hill much nearer Trapani"
7690,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"than the high ground above alluded to, and commanding a full view of"
7691,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the city and harbour. The reader who turns to the abridgement of Books
7692,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"xiii., xiv., xv., xvi. and xvii. given in this work, will find that all"
7693,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,these points are necessary.
7694,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7695,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"They all of them exist at this day, even to the calling of the"
7696,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"rock ""Raven,"" except one--I mean the mouth of the harbour where"
7697,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"the Phæacians entered; this is now silted up, like the harbour of"
7698,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Selinunte,[1] which I might almost call on the same coast. The inner"
7699,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"part of the harbour is still full of sea water, but has been converted"
7700,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,into Salt Works[2] which are slightly below the level of the sea. The
7701,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"bed of the old exit is clearly seen, and there are still rushes in it"
7702,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"though it is quite dry: it is very narrow, is often full in winter, and"
7703,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"is marked with dotted lines in the Italian Ordnance Map, but not so in"
7704,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,our Admiralty Chart.
7705,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7706,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"The existence of this bed was pointed out to me by Signor Sugameli, of"
7707,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Trapani. He assured me that till 1848 when the Salt Works were made,"
7708,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the whole space covered by them was an open mere where his father used
7709,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,to go to shoot wild ducks. One great difficulty in making the Salt
7710,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Works was the abundance of fresh water springs, which made it necessary"
7711,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,to cement the salt pans in order to keep the fresh water from mixing
7712,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,with the salt. It was perhaps from some of these springs that the
7713,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"πλυνοί, or washing cisterns, of vi. 40 were supplied--unless indeed"
7714,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Nausicaa washed the clothes in sea water as I have seen women in the
7715,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,island of Pantellaria still do.

7720,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7721,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Given a mass of water, nearly a mile long and a quarter of a mile"
7722,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"broad, with a narrow exit, and the tide, which here has a rise and fall"
7723,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"of from two to three feet, would cause a current that at times would"
7724,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"be strong, and justify its being described as a river and also as"
7725,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"a harbour with a current in it; returning for a moment to Scheria, I"
7726,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"suppose this to be the river at the mouth of which Ulysses landed, and"
7727,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"the river's staying his flow (v. 451), I take to mean that he arrived"
7728,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,there just at the turn of the tide. I may also say that this harbour is
7729,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,used five times in the _Odyssey_:--
7730,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7731,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"1. As the ""flowing harbour, in the country beyond the town, under Mt."
7732,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Neritum""--reading, as explained earlier, Νηρίτῳ for Νηίῳ--where Minerva"
7733,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"said she left her ship, when she was talking with Telemachus i. 185,"
7734,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,186. 2. As the place where Ulysses landed in Scheria and where Nausicaa
7735,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,washed her clothes. 3. As the place where Ulysses landed in Ithaca. 4.
7736,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,As the place where Telemachus landed in Ithaca on his return from Pylos
7737,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,(xv. 495 &c.). 5. As the spot pointed to by Ulysses as the one where
7738,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"his ship was lying ""in the country beyond the town"" (xxiv. 308)."
7739,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7740,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,I will now return to the two caves which ought to be found at no great
7741,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,distance from the head of this harbour. It is clear from the text that
7742,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"there were two not one, but some one has enclosed in brackets the two"
7743,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"lines in which the second cave is mentioned, I presume because he found"
7744,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,himself puzzled by having a second cave sprung upon him when up to this
7745,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,point he has been only told of one.
7746,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7747,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,I venture to think that if he had known the ground he would not have
7748,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"been puzzled, for there are two caves, distant about 80 or 100 yards"
7749,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"from one another, at the place marked in the map as the _grotta del"
7750,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"toro_. The one is conspicuous, but without special feature; the other,"
7751,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"which is not very easily seen, and which is called by the peasants"
7752,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"the _grotta del toro_, looks due North, and is universally believed"
7753,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"to contain a treasure, which a bull who lives in its recesses is"
7754,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"continually grinding, but which can only be found by a virgin, who will"
7755,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,eat a whole pomegranate without spilling a single pip. I suspect the
7756,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,_toro_ to be a children's corruption of _tesoro_. The bull having thus
7757,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"got into the cave has never got out again, and as the treasure is also"
7758,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,confidently known to exist--well--what can the bull be there for but to
7759,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,turn a mill and grind the treasure?
7760,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7761,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,The cave runs due South into the rock by a passage so rough and narrow
7762,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"that no one is likely to go more than a very few feet with it. No one,"
7763,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"therefore, can enter the cavern from the South--it is only the gods who"
7764,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,can do so.
7765,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7766,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"In August, 1894, I visited the ground with some Sicilian friends,"
7767,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,and we discoursed with the _contadino_ who had charge of the farm on
7768,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,which the caves are found. While we were talking there came up a nice
7769,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"intelligent lad on a donkey, and he seemed much interested in our"
7770,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,conversation.
7771,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7772,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Is there,"" we asked, pointing to the _grotta del toro_, ""a treasure in"
7773,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"the cave?"""
7774,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7775,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Certainly,"" was the immediate answer. Here the boy broke in. He was"
7776,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,quite sure there was one. Everybody knew it. It could not be doubted.
7777,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7778,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Is there a treasure in the other cave?"""
7779,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7780,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Oh, no."""
7781,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7782,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Which of the two caves is called the _grotta del toro_?"""
7783,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7784,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""That one""--from both peasant and boy, who pointed at once to the cave"
7785,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,that corresponded with the _Odyssey_.
7786,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7787,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""You are quite sure that the other cave is not called 'la grotta del"
7788,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"toro'?"""
7789,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7790,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Quite."""
7791,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7792,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Where does the _grotta del toro_ go to?"""
7793,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7794,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""It gets narrow and goes far into the rock."""
7795,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7796,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Has any one ever been to the end of it?"""
7797,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7798,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""No, no; no one knows where it ends. There was a cattle driver who went"
7799,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"in once to explore it, but he never came back, and they say that after"
7800,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"this there was a wall built to stop any one from going further."""
7801,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7802,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Have you ever been inside the cave yourself?"""
7803,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7804,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Yes."""
7805,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7806,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Have you been as far as the wall?"""
7807,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7808,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""No."""
7809,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7810,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""How far did you go?"""
7811,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7812,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Not very far; I was afraid."""
7813,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7814,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Then you have no idea how far the cave goes?"""
7815,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7816,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""No."""
7817,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7818,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Is there water in the cave at all times?"""
7819,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7820,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Yes."""
7821,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7822,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Have you seen it?"""
7823,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7824,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""I was there in May last, and there was water then."""
7825,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7826,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Is there water there now?"""
7827,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7828,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""I should think so, but cannot be certain."""
7829,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7830,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""Can you take us to it?"""
7831,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7832,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""No; the key of the ground is at Trapani."""
7833,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7834,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""They say there is a bull in the further recesses of the cavern?"""
7835,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7836,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"""They say so, but we have never seen him; all we know for certain is"
7837,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"that there is a treasure."""
7838,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7839,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Here the boy again brightened up, and said that this was certain."
7840,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7841,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,When we had finished our questions the _contadino_ took one of our
7842,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"party aside, and said, confidentially, ""Be sure of me, for I have a"
7843,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"strong stomach"" (_i.e_., I can keep a secret). ""When you come to remove"
7844,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"the treasure, which I can see that you intend to do, you must take me"
7845,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"with you and give me my share. If you come by night the dogs will bark,"
7846,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,and I shall know that you are there. I will then come down and help
7847,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"you, but you must give me my share."""
7848,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7849,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"I wrote the above conversation down, in Italian, immediately on my"
7850,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"return to Trapani, and my Sicilian friends signed it, at my request, as"
7851,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,a correct report. It occurs to me to add that there is no other cave
7852,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,near Trapani to which any story of a hidden treasure attaches.
7853,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7854,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Last year (May, 1896) I visited the cave again, this time with my"
7855,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"friend Mr. H. Festing Jones, who has gone over the whole of the ground"
7856,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"described in this book, to make sure that I have not overstated my"
7857,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"case. We were accompanied by Signor Sugameli of Trapani, to whom I"
7858,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,owe the correction of my error in believing the more conspicuous of
7859,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"the two caves to be called the _grotta del toro_--for so, on my first"
7860,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"visit to Trapani in 1892, my friends in the town had assured me, not"
7861,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,knowing the existence of the one which really bears the name. Jones and
7862,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Signor Sugameli scrambled into the interior of the cavern, but I, being"
7863,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"elderly and somewhat lame, did not venture. They found the cave end,"
7864,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"after about thirty feet, in a mass of solid rock; but few who have"
7865,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"gone above ten or twelve feet will be likely to go any further, and I"
7866,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"can well believe that the writer of the _Odyssey_, like the peasants"
7867,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"of to-day, believed that no one could get to the end of it. My friends"
7868,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,found water.
7869,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7870,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"The cave is full of bees' nests in summer, as are all the caves"
7871,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"hereabouts. They are small, solitary, of red clay, and about the size"
7872,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,of the cup of an acorn. All the caves in the neighbourhood of Mt. Eryx
7873,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"abound in remains of stone-age man, some fine examples of which may"
7874,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,be seen in the museum at Palermo. These remains would doubtless be
7875,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,more common and more striking three thousand years or so ago than they
7876,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"are at present, and I find no difficulty in thinking that the poetic"
7877,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,imagination of the writer of the Odyssey ascribed them to the nymphs
7878,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,and naiads.
7879,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7880,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"From hard by both the caves one can see, of course, the precipices"
7881,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"of Mt. Eryx, which I suppose to be Neritum in the mind of the writer"
7882,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"(xiii. 351), the straight paths on the cultivated land some couple of"
7883,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"hundred feet below, the harbour of the old merman Phorcys, and also the"
7884,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"harbours of Trapani, all which are requisite by lines xiii. 195, 196,"
7885,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,and 345-351.
7886,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7887,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,The reader will note that while more than one Scherian detail is given
7888,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"casually and perhaps unintentionally, as for example the harbour where"
7889,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Ulysses landed in Scheria, and the harbours, which I do not doubt are"
7890,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"the two harbours of Trapani, there is no Ithacan detail given so far"
7891,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,which conflicts with any feature in the description of Scheria.
7892,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7893,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,The number and value of the points of correspondence between the cave
7894,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"in which Ulysses hid his treasure, and the _grotta del toro_ greatly"
7895,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,exceed those between Grammerton and Shrewsbury. Nevertheless it will be
7896,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,well to see whether his movements on leaving the cave confirm my view
7897,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,or make against it.
7898,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7899,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"I suppose him to have ascended the steep, and then, doubtless, wooded"
7900,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,slopes of Mt. Eryx and to have passed along its high and nearly level
7901,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"summit (δἰ ἄκριας, xiv. 2) to the other end of the mountain, where"
7902,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the Norman Castle stands now 2500 feet above the sea level. Here he
7903,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,descended some two or three hundred feet to the spot now called _i
7904,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"runzi_, where there is a spring near a precipice which is still called"
7905,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"_il ruccazzù dei corvi, i.e_. ""the rock of the ravens,"" it being on"
7906,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,this part of the mountain that these birds breed most freely. This walk
7907,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"would take him about two hours, more or less."

7909,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"The site is seen from far and wide, it is bitterly cold in winter, and"
7910,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,is connected with Trapani by a rough mountain path which Ulysses may
7911,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,well have been afraid to travel without a stick (xvii. 195).[3] The
7912,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,path passes close to the round-topped _Colle di Sta Anna_ which answers
7913,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,perfectly to the Ἕρμαιος λόφος of xvi. 471. The time it takes to walk
7914,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,from the _runzi_ to Trapani corresponds with all the indications
7915,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,furnished us in the _Odyssey_ concerning the distance between Eumæus's
7916,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,hut and the town of Ithaca--which seems roughly to have been a winter's
7917,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,day walk there and back.
7918,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7919,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"The reader will see, therefore, that we have the whole road taken"
7920,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,by Ulysses from his landing in the harbour of Phorcys to the cave
7921,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"(with all its complex requirements) in which he hid his presents, up"
7922,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Mt. Neritum, along its long top to the spring and the Haven Rock,"
7923,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"and finally the path passing the hill of Mercury down to Ithaca, as"
7924,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,accurately presented to us by the road from the _saline di S. Cusumano_
7925,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"to the _grotta del toro_, Mt. Eryx, the fountain, the Raven Rock,"
7926,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"and the road to Trapani, as though the _Odyssey_ had been written"
7927,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"yesterday. When the reader can find me in all literature, ancient or"
7928,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"modern, any like chain of correspondences between an actual place and"
7929,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"one described in a work of fiction as an effect of mere chance, I will"
7930,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,accept the coincidences to which I have called attention as possibly
7931,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,accidental only; but I am convinced that no such case nor anything
7932,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,approaching it can be adduced.
7933,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7934,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"I, therefore, claim that Ithaca, like Scheria, must be taken as drawn"
7935,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"from Trapani. There is, however, this important point to be remembered,"
7936,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"that though the writer, when she has to consider Ithaca _ab extra_,"
7937,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"as an island and nothing more, pictures it to herself as the high and"
7938,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"striking island of Marettimo some 22 miles off Trapani, when she wants"
7939,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,details she takes them from her own immediate neighbourhood on the
7940,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,mainland.

7942,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Young people when transferring familiar stories to their own
7943,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"neighbourhood, as almost all young people do, never stick at"
7944,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"inconsistencies. They are like eminent Homeric scholars, and when they"
7945,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,mean to have things in any given way they will not let the native hue
7946,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"of resolution be balked by thought, and will find it equally easy to"
7947,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"have an Ithaca in one place and also in another, and to see the voyages"
7948,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,of Columbus to the tropics in their own sliding over a frozen pool. So
7949,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Lord Selborne writes:--
7950,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7951,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"As we grew, the faculty of imagination increased in"
7952,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,power. It coloured all our childish pleasures; it
7953,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,accompanied us on the ice and into the woods; it mixed
7954,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the dreams of the supernatural with the most ordinary
7955,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,things. Our resting-places when sliding over a frozen
7956,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"pool were the islands discovered by Columbus or Cook, in"
7957,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,whose voyages we delighted.

7959,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"(_Memorials &c_., by Roundell Palmer, Earl of Selborne,"
7960,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Macmillan 1896, pt. I. p. 66.)"
7961,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7962,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Before I leave the Ithaca scenes I ought to show that there may well
7963,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,have existed at Trapani a sheet of water which cattle would be likely
7964,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"to cross in a boat, as described in _Od_. XX. 186-188. The land on the"
7965,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"East side of Trapani was artificially raised in 1860, till which time"
7966,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the two seas on either side the town were often joined in winter after
7967,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,a continuance of Northerly Winds. Several people have assured me that
7968,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,they remember having to be carted over the water between Trapani and
7969,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the mainland. I was at first tempted to believe that Philœtius had
7970,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,come to the town when the narrow entrance to it was flooded; but a few
7971,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,lines above we find that Eumæus had also come to the town with three
7972,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"pigs, and Melanthius with some goats. These men had both unquestionably"
7973,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"come from Mt. Eryx, and the text seems to forbid the idea that they"
7974,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"too had had to cross the water. There is nothing, however, to imply"
7975,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"that Philœtius had come from Mt. Eryx; indeed, it is more likely that"
7976,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"his cattle would feed on the flat land south of the harbour, which he"
7977,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,had crossed by boat to save the long _détour_ which would have been
7978,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,otherwise necessary. If the water had been that of any such river as is
7979,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"to be found in Asia Minor, Greece, or Sicily, one man would probably"
7980,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"have been enough, whereas there seem to have been several plying for"
7981,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"hire, as in a port or harbour."

7985,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,The fact that Scheria and Ithaca would be perfectly well-known by
7986,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,the audience as drawn from their own neighbourhood explains another
7987,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"difficulty. ""How,"" some hypercritical listener might ask, ""could so"
7988,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,sagacious and experienced a mariner as Ulysses have failed to note that
7989,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"he was only travelling two miles, or even less, from Scheria to Ithaca?"
7990,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,And how again could he fail to recognise the place at which he landed
7991,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"as the one where he had met Nausicaa a few days previously?"""
7992,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
7993,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,The writer of the _Odyssey_ admits with some _naiveté_ that the
7994,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,Phæacian mariners were already acquainted with the harbour in which
7995,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,they left Ulysses. They probably would be. But how prevent Ulysses from
7996,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,remonstrating both during the voyage and on being landed? It is not
7997,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,easy to see what better course the writer could take than the one she
7998,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"actually did take, _i.e_., put Ulysses to sleep as soon as ever he was"
7999,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"on board, and not wake him till after the sailors were gone. A sleep,"
8000,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"therefore, is prepared for him (vii. 318, and viii. 445) and he falls"
8001,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,into it apparently before even leaving the harbour; it is so profound
8002,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"that it is more like death than sleep (xiii. 80). Nothing, not even the"
8003,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"men lifting him off the ship next morning, laying all his treasures"
8004,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"hard by him and going away, can disturb him till the Phæacian sailors"
8005,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"are beyond all reach of question. Then, of course, the sooner he wakes"
8006,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,up the better.
8007,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,
8008,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,As for the other difficulty of his not seeing that he was only at the
8009,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"spot where he had met Nausicaa two days earlier, this was got over by"
8010,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"making it a misty morning, and muddling Ulysses generally so that he"
8011,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"does not even recognise the place as Ithaca, much less as Scheria, till"
8012,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"Minerva meets him and has a long talk with him, in the course of which"
8013,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,"the audience slides into the situation, and accepts the neighbourhood"
8014,IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD.,of Trapani for that of Ithaca without more demur.

8043,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,seen no sufficient reason alleged for doubting that the Catalogues of
8044,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"_Il_. II. 484-877 formed part of the poem as Homer left it, though it"
8045,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,is quite likely that he may have got some one with greater knowledge of

8047,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,present will ask the reader to accept my assumption that the writer
8048,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,of the _Odyssey_ knew the Catalogues above referred to. The group of
8049,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,the Echinades and the Ionian islands are described as follows in the

8065,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"The reader will note that Dulichium, which means ""Long Island,"" does"

8067,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,the Echinades. Let us now see how the islands in the neighbourhood of
8068,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Ithaca are described in the _Odyssey_. Ulysses says (ix. 21-26):
8069,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8070,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"""I dwell in Ithaca, an island which contains a high"

8072,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"other islands near to one another, Dulichium, Same and"
8073,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Zacynthus. It lies on the horizon all highest up in the
8074,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"sea towards the west, while the other islands lie away"
8075,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"from it to the east."""
8076,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8077,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,[Illustration: MAP OF THE ÆONIAN ISLANDS--_Walker & Boutall_.]
8078,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8079,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,In the _Odyssey_ there are never more than three islands besides
8080,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Ithaca. When mentioned all together they are always named in the
8081,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,order given above--probably for reasons of scansion--but Dulichium is
8082,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"the most important in the eyes of the writer, being more frequently"
8083,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"mentioned separately, and sending fifty-two suitors as against"
8084,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"twenty-four from Same, twenty from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca"
8085,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,itself (xvi. 247-251).
8086,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8087,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,A glance at the map given above will show that there is no island in
8088,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,the neighbourhood of Ithaca which can with poetical propriety be held
8089,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,to have sent nearly as many suitors as the other three put together.
8090,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Least of all could Dulichium be so held. It seems, then, that it was"
8091,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"the name, and not the island, that the writer wanted; and further that"
8092,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,she wanted this so badly as to lay violent hands upon it and raid it
8093,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,from another group.
8094,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8095,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Why should she strain so considerable a point in order to get hold
8096,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,of it? The Iliadic catalogue omits three or four but leaves us six
8097,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Ionian islands. After suppressing the small islands of Crocylea and
8098,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Ægilips, there remained four, which it seems was the exact number that"
8099,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"the writer of the _Odyssey_ meant to introduce; why, then, should not"
8100,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Neritum have been good enough for her? It evidently did not answer her
8101,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"purpose, or she would not, in the face of the catalogue, have stowed"
8102,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,it away inside Ithaca and gone further afield for her dominant island.
8103,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"These things are never done without a reason, and in this case a reason"
8104,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"is particularly necessary, for it would have been more easy and also"
8105,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"suitable, considering the insignificance of the real Dulichium, to make"
8106,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,the fifty-two suitors come from the very considerable island of Neritum.
8107,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8108,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,All difficulty is removed by supposing that the writer lived at
8109,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Trapani and was drawing the Ionian islands from the, to her, familiar"
8110,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Ægadean group. A glance at the foregoing map will shew that she
8111,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,cannot have been drawing from the real Ionian islands. Ithaca cannot

8113,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,It is completely covered by Samos. Nor do the other islands lie away
8114,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"from it to the East. It is clear, then, that the Ionian islands were"
8115,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"not those present to the mind of the writer, but we may infer in"
8116,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"passing, firstly, that her audience lived at a sufficient distance"
8117,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,from Greece to make the infraction of topographical accuracy a matter
8118,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"of no importance, and secondly, that the islands from which she was in"

8167,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Cythera. 3. The island where Ulysses and his men hunted the goats, and"
8168,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"the adventure with Polyphemus. 4. The island of Æolus, and a ten days'"
8169,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"sail towards the East with a fair wind all the time, till Ithaca is"
8170,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"well in sight, followed by an immediate return to the island from which"
8171,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Ulysses had started. This sail to Ithaca over the toe of Italy and the
8172,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,island of Samos has no topographical significance except as showing
8173,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,that the writer conceived of the island of Æolus as lying a long way
8174,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,West of Ithaca. The episode is introduced merely for the purpose of
8175,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,bringing the cup close to Ulysses' lips and then dashing it from them.
8176,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"5. The Læstrygonians. 6. The island of Circe and the journey to Hades,"
8177,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"which last is again without topographical significance, being nothing"
8178,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"but a peg on which to hang colloquies with the dead, and bringing us"
8179,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,back to the island of Circe. 7. The Sirens. 8. Scylla and Charybdis.
8180,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,9. The cattle of the Sun. 10. The island of Calypso. 11. Scheria and
8181,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Ithaca.
8182,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8183,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,There is no difference of opinion among scholars as to the sites of the
8184,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Cicons, the island of Cythera, and the Lotus-eaters; the reader will,"
8185,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"therefore, see that we are taken without waste of time to a point at no"
8186,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,great distance from Sicily--the contrary winds off Cape Malea (ix. 81)
8187,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,being apparently raised on purpose to take us away from Greece. It is
8188,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,not quite easy to see why the Cicons were introduced unless it was that
8189,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Ulysses might become possessed of the wondrous wine of Ismarus with
8190,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,which lie intoxicated Polyphemus. The wine of this neighbourhood was
8191,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"famous many centuries after the _Odyssey_ was written, and presumably"
8192,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,was so in the time of the _Odyssey_ itself. A gasconading story of this
8193,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,wine may well have existed among the people of Trapani which might
8194,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"prompt the reader to introduce it, poke fun at it and make Polyphemus"
8195,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,drunk with it.
8196,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8197,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Or again, knowing as we do from Thucydides (vi. 2) that the original"
8198,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Sican inhabitants of this part of Sicily received an influx of
8199,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"fugitives from the neighbourhood of Troy after the fall of that city,"
8200,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,it is possible that traditions may have existed among the writer's
8201,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"audience to the effect that some of them were of Cicon origin, and she"
8202,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,may have wished to flatter them by telling them that they had repulsed
8203,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Ulysses. Nothing can be said with any confidence upon this head; all we
8204,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"may note is that the country is quite featureless, and hence does not"
8205,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"suggest drawing from personal knowledge, any more than does the land of"
8206,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,the Lotus-eaters.
8207,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8208,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,On leaving the land of the Lotus-eaters the full consent which has
8209,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,accompanied us so far fails us; nevertheless a considerable weight of
8210,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"authority, ancient, medieval, and modern, carries us to the island"
8211,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"of Favognana, anciently called Ægusa or Goat Island, as the one on"
8212,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,which Ulysses and his men hunted the goats. Indeed this incident seems
8213,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"introduced as though purposely to suggest the Ægadean or ""goat"" islands"
8214,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"to the audience, as also does the line iv. 606 in which Ithaca--that"
8215,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"is to say, in reality, the island of Marettimo--is said to be an island"
8216,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,fit for goats.[2]
8217,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8218,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,A very considerable consent accompanies us also to Mt. Eryx as the site
8219,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"of the adventure with Polyphemus. Here, and with the island on which"
8220,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"the goats were hunted, the local colour is stronger than anywhere else"
8221,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"in Ulysses' voyages, as indeed might be reasonably expected from a"
8222,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,writer whom I have shown to have been so intimately acquainted with the

8226,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8227,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Even partial consent, however, now fails us. The island of Æolus and"
8228,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,the country of the Læstrygonians have been placed in almost as many
8229,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,sites as there have been writers upon the _Odyssey_. I shall return
8230,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"to these on a later page, as also to the island of Favognana and the"
8231,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Cyclopes. My present object is to show how much of the voyage we may
8232,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"consider as known, how much as supported by considerable authority, and"
8233,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,how much we have yet to find.
8234,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8235,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,The partial consent which we lost at the cave of Polyphemus returns
8236,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"to us with the island of Circe, the Sirens and the Wandering Cliffs,"
8237,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"which are generally considered to have been the Lipari islands, and"
8238,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,universal consent rejoins us for Scylla and Charybdis. I can hardly say
8239,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,that consent is universal for placing the cattle of the Sun on the West
8240,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"coast of Sicily, somewhere about Tauromenium now Taormina; but it is"
8241,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"very general, and is so obviously well founded that I shall claim this"
8242,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,point as certain; for the name of the island sufficiently indicates
8243,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Sicily, the winds that detain Ulysses show him to have been on a West"
8244,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"coast, and the South wind that blew him back to Charybdis in a night"
8245,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,shows that he was supposed to be at no great distance South of the

8252,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"I have no consent for Scheria being Trapani, but after what I have"
8253,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"written above shall claim this point too as certain. The map,"
8254,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"therefore, which I here give will show the reader how we stand as"
8255,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,regards assent and otherwise ascertained points. I have used strong
8256,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"lines for the parts of the voyage that may be claimed as certain,"
8257,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,interrupted lines for the parts that are backed by considerable
8258,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"authority, and dotted lines for those which I would supply. I have made"
8259,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Ulysses approach Trapani from the South, on the strength of Calypso's"
8260,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"directions to him that he was to sail towards the Great Bear, keeping"
8261,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"it on his left hand (v. 276, 277).[3] This indicates certainly a"
8262,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Northerly, and one would say a N.N. Easterly, course; at any rate such"
8263,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,a course would in no way conflict with Calypso's instructions. Perhaps
8264,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,I had better give the words of the poem which run:--
8265,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8266,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"He sat keeping his eyes upon the Pleiades,[4] late"
8267,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"setting Boötes, and on the Bear, also called the Wain,"
8268,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"which turns round and round facing Orion, and alone never"
8269,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,sinks beneath the sea--for Calypso had bidden him steer
8270,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"by this, keeping it on his left hand (v. 272-277)."
8271,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8272,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,All the places in Ulysses' voyage have been generally referred to some
8273,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"actual locality, which was present to the writer's mind either under"
8274,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,its own or a fictitious name; and when we have once got into Sicilian
8275,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"waters, all those about which is there is any considerable amount"
8276,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"of consent, or which we may now, with or without consent, claim as"
8277,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"ascertained--I mean Circe's island, the Sirens, Scylla and Charybdis,"
8278,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"the Thrinacian island, Scheria and Ithaca are on, or hard by, the coast"
8279,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,of Sicily. Is not the temptation irresistible to think that the three
8280,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"unknown sites--the island of Æolus, the Land of the Læstrygonians and"
8281,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,the island of Calypso--are also real places however fictitious the
8282,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"names may be, and to hold that they should be looked for on, or near,"
8283,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,the coast of Sicily in the same order as that in which we find them
8284,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,described?
8285,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8286,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"If, on the hypothesis that Favognana and Mt. Eryx are the true sites"
8287,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"of the island on which Ulysses and his men hunted the goats, and of"
8288,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"the cave of Polyphemus, we are immediately led to others, in due"
8289,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"order of sequence, which commend themselves as being those of the"
8290,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"island of Æolus, the Land of the Læstrygonians, Circe's island, the"
8291,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"other established sites, and lastly Calypso's island, should we not"
8292,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"conclude, at any rate provisionally, that the hypothesis is a true one?"
8293,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8294,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"I will so conclude, and proceed to look for the island of Æolus in"
8295,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"some island, apparently solitary, a good way to the West of the Lipari"
8296,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"islands, and at no great distance from Mt. Eryx."
8297,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8298,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,I should first correct a very general misapprehension. The word πλωτῇ
8299,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,(x. 3) has been unduly pressed into meaning that the island floated
8300,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"about, and thus changed its place. But if so singular a phenomenon were"
8301,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,intended more would have been made of it. It would not have been dealt
8302,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"with in a single word, admitting easy explanation as mere metaphor. No"
8303,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"one presses the ""swiftly moving"" islands of xv. 299 into meaning that"
8304,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"the islands actually moved. All that is meant is that they ""seemed to"
8305,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"move"" as the ship flew past them, and so with the island of Æolus--""it"
8306,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"seemed to float on the horizon."" It shows no signs of having moved"
8307,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"during the month that Ulysses stayed on it, and when he returns to it"
8308,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"after an absence of three weeks, we have no hint given of its having"
8309,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"changed its place.[5] I conclude, therefore, that it was as fixed as"
8310,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"any other island, and proceed to look for it."
8311,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8312,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"This is no hard matter, for the island of Ustica offers itself at"
8313,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"once. In clear weather it can be faintly seen from Mt. Eryx, and would"
8314,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,naturally have impressed itself on the mind of a writer to whom Eryx
8315,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,and its neighbourhood was all in all. It is in the quarter from which
8316,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"the winds blow most fiercely on Trapani during the winter months,"
8317,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,and may fitly have been selected by a Trapanese writer as the home
8318,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"of the winds. The distance, a long way West of the Lipari islands,"
8319,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"and a greatly longer distance West of Ithaca, is all as it should"
8320,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"be. I accept it, therefore, and go on to look for the land of the"
8321,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Læstrygonians, and their city Telepylus, at some point on the North"
8322,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,coast of Sicily between Ustica and the Lipari islands.
8323,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8324,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"The name of the Læstrygonians or Workers in Stone,[6] like all names of"
8325,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"places or people inside Sicily, is fictitious. If there had ever been"
8326,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,any people really so called in Sicily Thucydides would have been able
8327,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"to find out some little, at any rate, about them; whereas he declares"
8328,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"(vi. 2) that he cannot do so, and subrisively refers his readers to"
8329,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"the poets, or whatever other source of information they can command."
8330,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Clearly he does not believe in them except as poetical fictions
8331,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,concerning the most ancient inhabitants of Sicily--of whom none are
8332,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,known to him as more ancient than the Sicans.
8333,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8334,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,But why should not the writer of the _Odyssey_ be referring under names
8335,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"of her own coinage to these same Sicans, for both the Cyclopes and"
8336,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"the Læstrygonians? The name of the Læstrygonian city, Telepylus, is"
8337,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"certainly fictitious. It means ""with gates far asunder,"" which can only"
8338,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,be an _ex post facto_ name: a city receives its name long before it is
8339,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,known what it will prove to be in the matter of growth. All that we can
8340,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,gather from the name is that the writer of the _Odyssey_ intended her
8341,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,audience to understand that the city was large.
8342,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8343,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Its inhabitants, like the Cyclopes, are giants and ogres. They being"
8344,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"giants, we should look for remains of megalithic buildings, and being"
8345,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,ogres we should suspect identity of race between them and the Cyclopes
8346,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"whom they so closely resemble. The writer hates them both, and looks"
8347,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,down upon the Cyclopes much as the Normans looked down upon the Saxons
8348,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,for some generations after the Conquest.
8349,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8350,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,The Cyclopes appear to have been subdued and outlawed; not so the
8351,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Læstrygonians. These last are a flourishing and very industrious
8352,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"people, who work by night as well as by day (x. 84-86). There is a poor"
8353,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"little prehistoric joke about them, to the effect that in their country"
8354,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,a man could earn double wages if he could only do without sleep.
8355,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,Moreover they were so wealthy and luxurious that they used to have
8356,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"relays of fresh milk (x. 82, 83), instead of being contented with a"
8357,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"morning supply, as Sicilian towns generally are even at the present"

8389,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,being written.[7] I have heard of the remains of a Cyclopean acropolis

8393,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"and the efforts of local archæologists will, I doubt not, lead to the"
8394,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,finding of others at or near many of the little known mountain sites
8395,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"in the North of Sicily; Dr. Orsi, indeed, has recently discovered the"
8396,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,remains of a megalithic house at Pantalica some forty miles inland from
8397,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Syracuse. No megalithic work, however, that has yet been found will"
8398,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"compare in importance with the remains at Eryx and Cefalù, nor does it"
8399,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,seem likely that any other such remains will be discovered.

8401,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"Bearing in mind, then, the situation of Cefalù both as regards Ustica"

8406,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,the harbour as given in the _Odyssey_ have no correspondence with the
8407,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"place itself. I may mention that when my friend, Mr. H. F. Jones, and"
8408,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"myself were at Cefalù in the spring of 1896, we met a flock of goats"
8409,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"coming into the town to be milked about five in the afternoon, and on"
8410,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,our return from a walk we met another flock coming out after having
8411,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"been just milked. These two flocks must have met, and the shepherds"
8412,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"must have saluted one another as in x. 82, 83, but unfortunately we did"
8413,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,not happen to be at their point of meeting.
8414,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,
8415,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,On enquiry we found that relays of fresh milk come into the town
8416,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"from six till eight in the morning, and from five till seven in the"
8417,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"afternoon, and were told that there was no other town known to our"
8418,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"informant which had more than a morning supply. At Trapani, a town with"
8419,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"30,000 inhabitants, there is no evening supply, and though I have no"
8420,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"doubt that fresh milk can be had in the evening at Palermo, Catania,"
8421,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"and Syracuse, it is not easily procurable even in these large towns,"
8422,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"while in smaller ones, so far as I know them, it is not to be had at"
8423,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,all. At Rome I asked the landlord of my hotel whether the goats came
8424,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,"to be milked in the evening as in the morning, and he said it would be"
8425,BE PRACTICALLY A SAIL ROUND SICILY FROM TRAPANI TO TRAPANI.,only in exceptional cases that they would do so.

8506,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,with the voyages which I have reserved in order to keep the general
8507,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,view more broad and simple.
8508,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8509,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,The habitat of the Cyclopes on Mt. Eryx is the point which it is most
8510,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"incumbent on me to establish, for if this be conceded, and both Scylla"
8511,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"and Charybdis, and Scheria be taken as found, all the other places fall"
8512,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"so spontaneously on to the sites I have marked for them, that I fear no"
8513,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"dispute concerning them. Let us turn, then, to Favognana and accept it"
8514,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,for the moment as the island on which Ulysses hunted the goats.
8515,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8516,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"Why, I wonder, was the author so careful to invoke a thick darkness, so"
8517,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"pompous and circumstantial, and to pilot Ulysses into the harbour of"
8518,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"this island by divine assistance, rather than permit him to look about"
8519,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"him and see the land, which was ""not very far"" off."
8520,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8521,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"The answer is ""not very far"" to seek. If Ulysses had seen the main land"
8522,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"of Sicily as he approached it from that of the Lotus-eaters, he would"
8523,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"have been sure to have followed it up, and in this case he would have"
8524,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"been taken straight into Trapani harbour. Now, though the writer, as"
8525,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"all the audience would know, had already dealt with Trapani, as the"
8526,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"last point in all Ulysses' voyages, Ulysses himself ought not to know"
8527,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,anything about it till he comes to it in due course.
8528,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8529,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,The cave of Polyphemus--still called among the peasants _la grotta di
8530,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,Polifemo_--was some six or seven miles North of Trapani; Ulysses had
8531,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"got to be taken there, and if possible, without unsettling either his"
8532,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,own mind or that of the audience by showing him a city which eight
8533,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"years later he was to know as Scheria. He could, with the help of a"
8534,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"little mist, be just supposed to go from the island of Favognana to the"
8535,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"promontory of Pizzolungo and the cave of Polyphemus, without seeing"
8536,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,the city of the Phæacians if he did not look particularly hard in that
8537,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"direction, but even Ulysses would have been compelled to take note of"
8538,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,Scheria if he had been allowed to go on till he reached its harbour.
8539,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"It was better, therefore, that some god should take him to the island"
8540,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"without letting him see any other land at all, and hence the intense"
8541,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,darkness which the writer has been so careful to describe. We shall
8542,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"see that later on (as regards the supposed time, though earlier in the"
8543,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,structure of her poem) she invokes a darkness which makes it impossible
8544,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"for Ulysses to form any idea of his whereabouts, in exactly the same"
8545,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"place, and for the same reasons (v. 291-294)--for here too it is"
8546,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"necessary to get Ulysses from a point South of Trapani, to another on"
8547,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,the North side of it without seeing the town.
8548,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8549,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,My map of the Ægadean islands (p. 177) combined with that of Trapani
8550,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,and Mt. Eryx (p. 164) will show the course Ulysses would make from
8551,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,Favognana to the _Grotta di Polifemo_--which is [by] far the largest
8552,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"cave near Trapani, and is still used as a place in which to keep a"
8553,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,large flock of sheep by night. The two rocks which Polyphemus threw
8554,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"should be seen, the first as the Asinelli,[1] and the second as the two"
8555,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"small islands called Formiche, which, being close together, are taken"
8556,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,as one.
8557,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8558,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"I find, therefore, in the care taken to prevent Ulysses from seeing"
8559,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"Trapani, a considerable argument for the belief that Favognana was the"
8560,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"island where Ulysses hunted the goats, and that the cave of Polyphemus"
8561,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,was on Mt. Eryx.
8562,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8563,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"Another indication, though one of no great strength, seems to suggest"
8564,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,that the Cyclopes were still near neighbours of the Phæacians.
8565,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8566,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,At the beginning of Book vi. we learn that the Phæacians used to live
8567,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"at a place called Hypereia, ""near the lawless Cyclopes,"" but had of"
8568,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"late years been moved to Scheria, which, as I have said, means Jutland."
8569,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,In a passage which I have not given in my abridgement Alcinous says
8570,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"casually (vii. 205, 206) that the Phæacians are as closely related to"
8571,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,the gods as the Cyclopes and the giants are. Passing over the fact that
8572,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"Alcinous, being grandson to Neptune, was half nephew to Polyphemus, the"
8573,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,spontaneousness with which the Cyclopes rise to his mind suggests that
8574,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"though less near than they had been, they were still about the nearest"
8575,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,neighbours that he had.
8576,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8577,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"The giants are only the Cyclopes over again, and are doubtless the"
8578,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,descendants of the people who built the noble megalithic walls of
8579,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"Eryx. Hypereia, or Upper-town, was probably at the Eastern end of"
8580,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"the top of Mt. Eryx on a site where a very ancient wall, of totally"
8581,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,different character to those of the Sican city at the West end of the
8582,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"mountain, may yet be traced. The remains of this wall are just above"
8583,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"the _Ruccazzù dei Corvi_, in Count Pepoli's grounds, and were first"
8584,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,shown me by the Count. A stranger is little likely to find them unless
8585,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,conducted by one who has seen them.
8586,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8587,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,As regards Hypereia I would repeat that all the names of places in
8588,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"Sicily with one partial exception are fictitious, even Trinacria, which"
8589,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"Thucydides tells us was the most ancient name of Sicily, becoming ""the"
8590,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"Thrinacian,"" or ""three-pointed,"" island; whereas as soon as we are"
8591,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,outside Sicily the names are real. This affords ground for thinking
8592,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"that the writer was drawing real people as well as real places, and"
8593,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,travestying them under flimsy disguises that she knew her audience
8594,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"would see through. Once only is the mask dropped for a moment, when"
8595,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"Ulysses says that he had just come from Sicania (xxiv. 307), but this"
8596,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"does not count, for Ulysses is supposed to be lying."
8597,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8598,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"The name Cyclopes, for example, or ""round faces""--for there is nothing"
8599,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"in the word to show that it means anything else than this, and I see"
8600,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,from Liddell & Scott that Parmenides calls the moon Cyclops--is merely
8601,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"an author's nick name. If μήλωψ means ""apple-faced,"" κύκλωψ should mean"
8602,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"""circle-faced."" As there is nothing in the word, so neither is there"
8603,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"in the _Odyssey_, to suggest that the Cyclopes were a people with only"
8604,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,one round eye in the middle of their foreheads. Such a marked feature
8605,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"does not go without saying,[2] and that it did not go with the earliest"
8606,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,Greek artists appears from the fact that they always gave Polyphemus
8607,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"two eyes. It is not till Roman times that he becomes monophthalmic,"
8608,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"and the _Odyssey_ gives him eyebrows in the plural (ix. 389), which"
8609,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"involve eyes in the plural also. True, the writer only blinds one eye,"
8610,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,but she could trust to the sympathetic inflammation which so serious
8611,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"an injury would excite in the other eye, and would consider that she"
8612,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,had sufficiently blinded both by roasting one of them. One eye alone
8613,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"was blinded, not because Polyphemus had not got two, but because his"
8614,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"pole had not got two prongs, and the writer saw neither how to get a"
8615,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"bifurcated instrument into the cave, nor how to wield it now that so"
8616,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,many of the men had been eaten.
8617,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8618,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"""Cyclopes,"" therefore, we may be sure, means nothing more than"
8619,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"""moon-faced."" The name Polyphemus is found as that of a hero in the"
8620,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"_Iliad_, and is perhaps a pseudonym for the local giant (if there"
8621,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"was one) taken from that poem. ""Whatever his name may have been, and"
8622,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"whether he was a pre-Odyssean giant, or whether the writer of the"
8623,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"_Odyssey_ called him into being, he exists now under the name of"
8624,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,Conturràno. I have sometimes wondered whether this name may have any

8626,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,that the giant was so tall as to be able to knock a hole in the sky
8627,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"with his staff. Should this be so, his name, as likely as not was"
8628,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"Conturràno, or something near it, in the days of the _Odyssey_, and it"
8629,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,was with the κόντος commemorated in his own name that Ulysses blinded
8630,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"him. The giant has grown greatly since the _Odyssey_ was written, and"
8631,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"large as the _grotta di Polifemo_ is, he could never get inside it;"
8632,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,for he rests his feet on the plain while he props his stomach on the
8633,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"top of Mt. Eryx, and bending forward plunges his huge hands into the"
8634,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"sea between Bonagia and Cofàno, to catch tunnies. When disturbed he"
8635,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"tears great rocks from the top of Mt. Eryx, and dashes them at all who"
8636,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,interrupt him.
8637,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8638,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"To repeat and to sum up, for I will argue this point no further;"
8639,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,I take the Cyclopes to be the conquered remnant of the old Sican
8640,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,inhabitants of Mt. Eryx. They owe their gigantic stature to the huge
8641,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,size of the stones with which the walls of their city on Mt. Eryx were
8642,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,built. These stones show few or no signs of having been worked with
8643,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"a tool of hardened bronze or iron, save in so far as the Phœnicians"
8644,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"may have trimmed them here and there when they rebuilt the walls, in"
8645,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"part, _de novo_, with stones some of which bear quarry-men's marks in"
8646,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"Phœnician characters.[3] The old Sican work, a good deal of which has"
8647,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"been allowed to stand, belongs to the true megalithic age, when it was"
8648,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"cheaper to carry than to cut; later generations, failing to consider"
8649,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,the revolution which the introduction of improved methods of cutting
8650,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"had effected, argued that the men who built with such large stones must"
8651,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"have been large men, whereas in reality they were only economical men."
8652,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,
8653,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"As soon as it became cheaper to cut than to carry, the huge unwieldy"
8654,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"blocks that we see at Eryx, at Cefalù, and at Segni, Arpino, Allatri,"
8655,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"and many another city in Southern Italy, became obsolete, but it was"
8656,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,still long before all irregularity in the courses was abandoned for
8657,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"that perfect regularity which we find at Syracuse, Selinunte, the"
8658,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"temple of Segesta, and nearly all the Greek and Roman architecture"
8659,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,of historic times. Indeed I know many buildings as late as the tenth
8660,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"century after Christ, in which the courses are far from regular;"
8661,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"nevertheless the tendency, almost immediately after cutting had become"
8662,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"cheaper, was towards greater regularity of courses and the use of"
8663,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,"smaller stones, until there arose another megalithicism, of a kind"
8664,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,diametrically opposed to that of the earlier builders--I mean the
8665,MT. ERYX AND TRAPANI.,megalithicism of display.

8688,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Furthermore, I would ask the reader to remark how closely the"
8689,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],description of the Cyclopes in the _Odyssey_ tallies with that of the
8690,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"modern Sicilian brigands published in the _Times_ of September 24th,"
8691,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],1892.
8692,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8693,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],The writer--Mr. Stigand--says:--
8694,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8695,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"S. Mauro, the headquarters of the brigands, is a town on"
8696,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"the top of a mountain 3000 feet high, and in sight of"
8697,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Geraci Siculo, another town of about the same height, and"
8698,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"of Pollina, also on the summit of another mountain. The"
8699,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"roads among the mountains, connecting these towns, are"
8700,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],mere mule paths. The mountains abound in caves known only
8701,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],to the brigands and shepherds.
8702,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8703,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],The _Odyssey_ says of the Cyclopes:--
8704,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8705,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"They have neither places of assembly nor laws, but they"
8706,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],live in caves on the tops of high mountains; each one of
8707,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"them rules over his own wife and children, and they take"
8708,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],no account of any one else (ix. 112-115).
8709,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8710,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],I saw several families of cave-dwellers at a place called _le grotte
8711,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],degli Scurati_ on Cofàno about fifteen miles North of Trapani. There
8712,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"was, however, nothing of the Cyclops about them. Their caves were most"
8713,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],beautifully clean and as comfortable as the best class of English
8714,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"cottages. The people, who were most kind and hospitable, were more fair"
8715,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"than dark, and might very well have passed for English. They provided"
8716,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],us with snow white table cloths and napkins for the lunch which we had
8717,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"brought from Trapani, and they gave us any quantity of almonds fried"
8718,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"in a little salt and butter; most unexpected of all, the salt they"
8719,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],brought us was mixed with chervil seed. There was an atrocious case
8720,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],of brigandage on Cofàno about a fortnight later than our pic-nic. A
8721,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],Palermo merchant was kept a whole month on the mountain till he was
8722,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"ransomed, but I am sure that our cave-dwellers had nothing to do with"
8723,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],it. The caves bore traces of prehistoric man by way of ancient meals
8724,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],now petrified.
8725,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8726,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],It is noticeable that forms of the word σπέος or ἄντρον (cave) appear
8727,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"forty-five times in the _Odyssey_ as against only six in the _Iliad_,"
8728,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"which, allowing for the greater length of the last named poem, is"
8729,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"about in the proportion of 10:1. We may surmise, therefore, that the"
8730,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],_Odyssey_ hails from a district in which caves abounded.
8731,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8732,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"As regards ""the wall of bronze"" which the writer of the _Odyssey_"
8733,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"tells us ran round the island of Æolus, it is hard to say whether it"
8734,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],was purely fiction or no. We may be sure that it was no more made of
8735,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"bronze than Æolus was king of the winds, but all round the island of"
8736,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Marettimo, wherever the cliffs do not protect it naturally, there"
8737,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"existed a wall of long pre-Odyssean construction, traces of which"
8738,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"were shown me by Sigr. Tedesco and Professor Spadaro, without whose"
8739,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],assistance I should not have observed them. I have sometimes wondered
8740,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"whether the writer may not have transferred this wall to Ustica, as"
8741,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],we shall see later that she transferred the hump on Thersites' back
8742,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],to that of Eurybates; but no traces of any such wall exist so far as
8743,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"I know on Ustica, nor yet on the islands of Favognana or Levanzo. The"
8744,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"ancient name of Marettimo was Hiera, and about 1,900 feet above the"
8745,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],sea I was shown ruins (not striking) of exceedingly ancient walls on a
8746,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"small plateau which the inhabitants dare not cross by night, and which"
8747,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],is believed to have been the site of the cult that gave its name to the
8748,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],island.
8749,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8750,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],What I have to say about Circe's island is so speculative that I write
8751,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"it in fear and trembling. I see that Circe's house is, like Eumæus's"
8752,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"pig farm, ""in a place that can be seen from far"" (x. 211), and I see"
8753,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"also that Ulysses approaches it ""over the top of the mountain"" (x."
8754,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"281), as he does Eumæus's hut (xiv. 2). I remember the pigs, and I"
8755,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],cannot refrain from thinking that though the writer tells us in the
8756,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"first instance that the island was a low one (x. 196), her inability"
8757,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"to get away from her own surroundings is too much for her, and she"
8758,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],is drifting on to the top of Mt. Eryx and Eumæus's pig farm. She
8759,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],does not mean to have pigs at first--the men whom Circe bewitched on
8760,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],previous occasions were turned into wolves and lions--but the force of
8761,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"association is too strong for her, and Ulysses' men are turned into"
8762,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],pigs after all.
8763,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8764,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],The fall of Elpenor from the top of Circe's house is a very singular
8765,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],way of killing him. If he had been at Eumæus's hut she could not have
8766,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],killed him more naturally than by letting him tumble off the precipice
8767,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"that overhangs it, and on the top of which the temple of Venus stood"
8768,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"in later ages. I suspect, not without shame, that the wall of Circe's"
8769,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],house is made to do duty for this precipice.
8770,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8771,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"On the island of Panaria, anciently Enonymus, among the Lipari group,"
8772,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"there is a small bay called La Caletta dei Zummari, which suggests a"
8773,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"corruption of Cimmerii, but I have already explained that no attempt"
8774,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],should be made to localise the journey to Hades.
8775,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8776,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"The two Sirens can be placed with, I should say, confidence, on the"
8777,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"island of Salina anciently called Didyme from the two high mountains,"
8778,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"each about 3000 feet high, of which it consists. Sudden cat's paws"
8779,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],of very violent wind descend at times from all high points near the
8780,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"sea in this part of the Mediterranean, as from Cofàno near Trapani,"
8781,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"where there is a saying among the fishermen ""ware Cofàno."" My friend,"
8782,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Signor E. Biaggini, whose loss I have to deplore within the last"
8783,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"twelve months, and who has furnished me over and over again with"
8784,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"local details, told me that he once was all but capsized by a gust"
8785,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"from Cofàno, that came down on his boat in perfectly calm weather,"
8786,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],and lasted hardly more than a few seconds. I take it that the two
8787,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],Sirens--who are always winged in the earlier Greek representations
8788,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"of them--were, as indeed their name suggests, the whistling gusts or"
8789,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],avalanches of air that descended without the slightest warning from the
8790,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"two mountains of Didyme. The story turned from poetry into prose means,"
8791,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"""Woe to him who draws near the two treacherous mountains of Didyme; the"
8792,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"coast is strewn with wreckage, and if he hears the wind from off them"
8793,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"shriek in his rigging his bones will whiten the shore."" The reader will"
8794,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],remember that the Sirens' island is very near Circe's.

8796,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],Speaking of the Æolian islands Admiral Smyth says:--
8797,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8798,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Whether from the heat of the water by volcanic springs,"
8799,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"the steam of Vulcanella, the incessant hot injections"
8800,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"from Stromboli, or all of them added to the general"
8801,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"temperature, it is certain that there are more frequent"
8802,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],changes in this group than in the neighbourhood (_The
8803,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Mediterranean_, Parkers, 1854, p. 250)."
8804,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8805,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Speaking, again, of the Straits of Messina, he says:--"
8806,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8807,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Precautions should also be taken against the heavy gusts,"
8808,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"which at times, from the mountainous nature of the"
8809,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"coasts, rush down the Fuimare, and are dangerous to small"
8810,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"vessels. I have twice, with grief, seen the neglect of"
8811,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"them prove fatal (_Sicily and its Islands_, Murray, 1824,"
8812,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],p. 111).
8813,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8814,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],The reason why the poetess found herself in such difficulties about the
8815,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Wandering Cliffs, is because the story, as Buttmann has said, does not"
8816,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"refer to any two islands in particular, but is derived from traveller's"
8817,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],tales about the difficulties of navigating the Lipari islands as a
8818,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"whole. ""They close in upon you,"" it was said, ""so quickly one after"
8819,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"another that a bird can hardly get through them."" The ""hurricanes of"
8820,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"fire,"" moreover (xii. 68), suggest an allusion to the volcanic nature"
8821,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],of the Æolian islands generally. Still more so does the dark cloud that
8822,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],never leaves the top of Scylla's rock (xii. 74) neither in summer nor
8823,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],winter.
8824,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8825,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],The terrors of Scylla and Charybdis are exaggerated in the same poetic
8826,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],vein as the Sirens and the Wandering Cliffs. Instead of its being
8827,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"possible to shoot an arrow from the one to the other, they are about"
8828,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],eight miles apart. We ought not to look for the accuracy of one of Mr.
8829,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],Murray's handbooks in a narrative that tells us of a monster with six
8830,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],heads and three rows of teeth. It is enough if there are a few grains
8831,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"of truth, and these there are: for Scylla is a high rock looking West,"
8832,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"and Charybdis is (for those days) a formidable whirlpool, on the other"
8833,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"side the Straits, off lower ground, and hard by the approach to a three"
8834,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],pointed island. According to Admiral Smyth it is just outside Messina
8835,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"harbour, and is now called Galofaro. Admiral Smyth says of it:--"
8836,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8837,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"To the undecked boats of the Rhegians, Locrians,"
8838,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Zancleans and Greeks, it must have been formidable"
8839,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],for even in the present day small craft are sometimes
8840,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"endangered by it, and I have seen several men-of-war,"
8841,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"and even a seventy-four-gun, ship, whirled round on its"
8842,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],surface; but by using due caution there is generally very
8843,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],little danger or inconvenience to be apprehended (_Sicily
8844,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"and its Islands_, Murray, 1824, p. 123)."
8845,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8846,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],I do not doubt that the Galofaro is the nucleus round which the story
8847,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"of Charybdis gathered, but I have seen considerable disturbance in the"
8848,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],sea all through the Straits of Messina. Very much depends upon the
8849,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"state of the winds, which sometimes bank the water up in the angle"
8850,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"between the toe of Italy and the North coast of Sicily, on which a"
8851,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],current and strong eddies occur in the Straits of Messina. At other
8852,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],times there is hardly anything noticeable.
8853,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8854,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Passing over the nine days drifting in the sea, which take Ulysses from"
8855,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Charybdis to the island of Calypso, _i.e_. Pantellaria--and we may be"
8856,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],sure he would have been made to take longer time if the writer had
8857,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],dared to keep him longer without food and water--it only remains for me
8858,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],to deal at somewhat fuller length than I have yet done with the voyage
8859,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],from Pantelleria to Trapani. On the eighteenth day after Ulysses had
8860,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"left Pantellaria, steering towards the Great Bear, but keeping it on"
8861,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"his left, he saw the long low line of the Lilybæan coast rising on the"
8862,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"horizon. He does not appear to have seen the island of Favognana, which"
8863,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"must have been quite near, and it was perhaps as well that he did not,"
8864,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],for he could hardly have failed to recognise it as the one on which he
8865,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"had hunted the goats some eight or nine years previously, and this"
8866,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],might have puzzled him.
8867,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8868,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],But though he is allowed to see the land he must not be permitted to
8869,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"follow it up, or, as I have explained already, he would have gone"
8870,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"straight into the harbour of Scheria, whereas he is particularly wanted"
8871,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"to meet Nausicaa on the North side of the town, and to know nothing"
8872,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"about Scheria till she brings him to it. Neptune, therefore, is made to"
8873,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],catch sight of him at this moment and to raise a frightful hurricane;
8874,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"sea and sky become obscured in clouds, with a darkness as dense as"
8875,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"night (v. 291-294), and thus Ulysses is carried a long distance"
8876,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"apparently to the North, for when he has been taken far enough, Minerva"
8877,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"blows him two days and two nights before a North wind, and hence"
8878,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Southwards, till he reaches the harbour near which Nausicaa can meet"
8879,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],him.
8880,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8881,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"There are no other such noticeable darknesses in the _Odyssey_, as this"
8882,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"and the one of Book ix. 144, alluded to on p. 188. They both occur in"

8889,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"with singular fidelity from Trapani and its neighbourhood, as also all"
8890,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"the Scherian; moreover, I have shown that the Ionian islands are in"
8891,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],reality drawn from the Ægadean group off Trapani; lastly I have shown
8892,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],that the voyage of Ulysses in effect begins with Trapani and ends with
8893,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],Trapani again. I need not deal with Pylos and Lacedæmon beyond showing
8894,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],that they were far removed from the knowledge of either writer or
8895,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],audience.
8896,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],
8897,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],There is not a single natural feature mentioned in either case.

8901,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"no hint of any mountain to be crossed--from which we may infer, either"
8902,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"that she knew nothing of the country between Pylos and Lacedæmon, or"

8905,COLUMN AT SELINUNTE.],"Telemachus from Ithaca to Pylos, was more suitable for taking him from"

8933,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,WHO WAS THE WRITER?
8934,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
8935,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
8936,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"I believe the reader will by this time feel no doubt, from my earlier"
8937,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Chapters that the _Odyssey_ was written by one woman, and from my later"
8938,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"ones that this woman knew no other neighbourhood than that of Trapani,"
8939,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,and therefore must be held to have lived and written there.
8940,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
8941,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Who, then, was she?"
8942,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
8943,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,I cannot answer this question with the confidence that I have felt
8944,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,hitherto. So far I have been able to demonstrate the main points of my
8945,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"argument; on this, the most interesting question of all, I can offer"
8946,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,nothing stronger than presumption.
8947,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
8948,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"We have to find a woman of Trapani, young, fearless, self-willed, and"
8949,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,exceedingly jealous for the honour of her sex. She seems to have moved
8950,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"in the best society of her age and country, for we can imagine none"
8951,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,more polished on the West coast of Sicily in Odyssean times than the
8952,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,one with which the writer shews herself familiar. She must have had
8953,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"leisure, or she could not have carried through so great a work. She"
8954,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"puts up with men when they are necessary or illustrious, but she is"
8955,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"never enthusiastic about them, and likes them best when she is laughing"
8956,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,at them; but she is cordially interested in fair and famous women.
8957,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
8958,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,I think she should be looked for in the household of the person whom
8959,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,she is travestying under the name of King Alcinous. The care with which
8960,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"his pedigree and that of his wife Arete is explained (vii. 54-77),"
8961,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,and the warmth of affectionate admiration with which Arete is always
8962,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"treated, have the same genuine flavour that has led scholars to see"
8963,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,true history and personal interest in the pedigree of Æneas given in
8964,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"_Il_. xx. 200-241. Moreover, she must be a sufficiently intimate member"
8965,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,of the household to be able to laugh at its head as much as she chose.
8966,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,No pedigree of any of the other _dramatis personæ_ of the _Odyssey_
8967,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"is given save that of Theoclymenus, whose presence in the poem at all"
8968,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,requires more explanation than I can give. I can only note that he was
8969,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"of august descent, more than sub-clerical, and of a different stamp"
8970,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,from any other character to whom we are introduced.
8971,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
8972,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,The fact that the writer should be looked for in a member of King
8973,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Alcinous' household seems further supported by the zest with which
8974,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"this household and garden are described (vii. 81-132), despite the"
8975,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,obviously subrisive exaggeration which pervades the telling. There
8976,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"is no such zest in the description of any other household, and the"
8977,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,evident pleasure which the writer takes in it is more like that of a
8978,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"person drawing her own home, than either describing some one else's or"
8979,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,creating an imaginary scene. See how having begun in the past tense she
8980,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,slides involuntarily into the present as soon as she comes to the women
8981,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,of the house and to the garden. She never does this in any other of her
8982,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,descriptions.
8983,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
8984,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Lastly, she must be looked for in one to whom the girl described as"
8985,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Nausicaa was all in all. No one else is drawn with like livingness and
8986,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"enthusiasm, and no other episode is written with the same, or nearly"
8987,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"the same, buoyancy of spirits and resiliency of pulse and movement,"
8988,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,or brings the scene before us with anything approaching the same
8989,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"freshness, as that in which Nausicaa takes the family linen to the"
8990,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,washing cisterns. The whole of Book vi. can only have been written by
8991,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,one who was throwing herself into it heart and soul.
8992,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
8993,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,All the three last paragraphs are based on the supposition that the
8994,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"writer was drawing real people. That she was drawing a real place,"
8995,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"lived at that place, and knew no other, does not admit of further"
8996,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,question; we can pin the writer down here by reason of the closeness
8997,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,with which she has kept to natural features that remain much as they
8998,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,were when she pourtrayed them; but no traces of Alcinous's house and
8999,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"garden, nor of the inmates of his household will be even looked for by"
9000,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"any sane person; it is open, therefore, to an objector to contend that"
9001,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,though the writer does indeed appear to have drawn permanent features
9002,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"from life, we have no evidence that she drew houses and gardens and"
9003,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,men and women from anything but her own imagination.
9004,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9005,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Granted; but surely, in the first place, if we find her keeping to her"
9006,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,own neighbourhood as closely as she can whenever the permanency of the
9007,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"features described enables us to be certain of what she did, there is"
9008,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,a presumption that she was doing the same thing in cases where the
9009,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,evidence has been too fleeting to allow of our bringing her to book.
9010,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"And secondly, we have abundant evidence that the writer did not like"
9011,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,inventing.
9012,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9013,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Richly endowed with that highest kind of imagination which consists
9014,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,in wise selection and judicious application of materials derived from
9015,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"life, she fails, as she was sure to do, when cut off from a base of"
9016,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,operation in her own surroundings. This appears most plainly in the
9017,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,three books which tell of the adventures of Ulysses after he has left
9018,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Mt. Eryx and the Cyclopes. There is no local detail in the places
9019,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"described; nothing, in fact, but a general itinerary such as she could"
9020,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,easily get from the mariners of her native town. With this she manages
9021,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"to rub along, helping herself out with fragments taken from nearer"
9022,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"home, but there is no approach to such plausible invention as we find"
9023,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"in _Gulliver's Travels, Robinson Crusoe_, or _Pilgrim's Progress_;"
9024,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,and when she puts a description of the land of Hades into the mouth
9025,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,of Circe (x. 508-515)--which she is aware must be something unlike
9026,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,anything she had ever witnessed--she breaks down and gives us a scene
9027,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,which carries no conviction. Fortunately not much detail is necessary
9028,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"here; in Ithaca, however, a great deal is wanted, and feeling invention"
9029,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"beyond her strength she does not even attempt it, but has recourse with"
9030,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,the utmost frankness to places with which she is familiar.
9031,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9032,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Not only does she shirk invention as much as possible in respect of
9033,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"natural features, but she does so also as regards incident. She can"
9034,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,vilipend her neighbours on Mt. Eryx as the people at Trapani continue
9035,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"doing to this day, for there is no love lost between the men of Trapani"
9036,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"and those of Mte. S. Giuliano, as Eryx is now called. She knows Ustica:"
9037,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"the wind comes thence, and she can make something out of that; then"
9038,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,there is the other great Sican city of Cefalù--a point can be made
9039,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,here; but with the Lipari islands her material is running short. She
9040,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"has ten years to kill, for which, however, eight or eight-and-a-half"
9041,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,may be made to pass. She cannot have killed more than three months
9042,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"before she lands her hero on Circe's island; here, then, in pity's name"
9043,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,let him stay for at any rate twelve months--which he accordingly does.
9044,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9045,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"She soon runs through her resources for the Sirens' island, and Scylla"
9046,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,and Charybdis; she knows that there is nothing to interest her on the
9047,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,West coast of Sicily below Taormina--for Syracuse (to which I will
9048,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"return) was still a small pre-Corinthian settlement, while on the South"
9049,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,coast we have no reason to believe that there was any pre-Hellenic
9050,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"city. What, she asked herself, could she do but shut Ulysses up in the"
9051,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,most lonely island she could think of--the one from which he would have
9052,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"the least chance of escaping--for the remainder of his term? She chose,"
9053,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"therefore, the island which the modern Italian Government has chosen,"
9054,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"for exactly the same reasons, as the one in which to confine those who"
9055,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,cannot be left at large--the island of Pantellaria; but she was not
9056,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"going to burden Calypso for seven long years with all Ulysses' men, so"
9057,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,his ship had better be wrecked.
9058,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9059,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,This way out of the difficulty does not indicate a writer of fecund
9060,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"or mature invention. She knew the existence of Sardinia, for Ulysses"
9061,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"smiles a grim Sardinian smile (xx. 302). Why not send him there, and"
9062,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,describe it with details taken not from the North side of Trapani but
9063,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,from the South? Or she need not have given details at all--she might
9064,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,have sent him very long journeys extending over ever so many years in
9065,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,half a page. If she had been of an inventive turn there were abundant
9066,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,means of keeping him occupied without having recourse to the cheap
9067,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,and undignified expedient of shutting him up first for a year in one
9068,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"island, and then for seven in another. Having made herself so noble a"
9069,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"peg on which to hang more travel and adventure, she would have hung"
9070,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"more upon it, had either strength or inclination pointed in that"
9071,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,direction. It is one of the commonplaces of Homeric scholars to speak
9072,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"of the voyages of Ulysses as ""a story of adventurous travel."" So in a"
9073,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"way they are, but one can see all through that the writer is trying to"
9074,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,reduce the adventurous travel to a minimum.
9075,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9076,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,See how hard put to it she is when she is away from her own actual
9077,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,surroundings. She does not repeat her incidents so long as she is at
9078,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"home, for she has plenty of material to draw from; when she is away"
9079,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"from home, do what she may, she cannot realise things so easily, and"
9080,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"has a tendency to fall back on something she has already done. Thus, at"
9081,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Pylos, she repeats the miraculous flight of Minerva (iii. 372) which"
9082,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,she had used i. 320. On reaching the land of the Læstrygonians Ulysses
9083,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"climbs a high rock to reconnoitre, and sees no sign of inhabitants save"
9084,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,only smoke rising from the ground--at the very next place he comes to
9085,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"he again climbs a high rock to reconnoitre, and apparently sees no sign"
9086,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,of inhabitants but only the smoke of Circe's house rising from the
9087,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,middle of a wood. He is conducted to the house of Alcinous by a girl
9088,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,who had come out of the town to fetch a pitcher of water (vii. 20);
9089,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,this is repeated (x. 105) when Ulysses' men are conducted to the house
9090,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"of the Læstrygonian Antiphates, by a girl who had come out of the town"
9091,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,to fetch a pitcher of water. The writer has invented a sleep to ruin
9092,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Ulysses just as he was well in sight of Ithaca (x. 31, &c.). This is"
9093,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"not good invention, for such a moment is the very last in which Ulysses"
9094,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,would be likely to feel sleepy--but the effort of inventing something
9095,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,else to ruin him when his men are hankering after the cattle of the Sun
9096,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"is quite too much for her, and she repeats (xii. 366) the sleep which"
9097,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"had proved so effectual already. So, as I have said above, she repeats"
9098,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,the darkness on each occasion when Ulysses seems likely to stumble upon
9099,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Trapani. Calypso, having been invented once, must do duty again as"
9100,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Circe--or _vice versâ_, for Book x. was probably written before Book v."
9101,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9102,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Such frequent examples of what I can only call consecutive octaves
9103,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"indicate a writer to whom invention does not come easily, and who is"
9104,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,not likely to have recourse to it more than she can help. Having shown
9105,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"this as regards both places and incidents, it only remains to point"
9106,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,out that the writer's dislike of invention extends to the invention of
9107,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,people as well as places. The principal characters in the _Odyssey_
9108,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"are of all of them Scherian. Nestor, Ulysses, Menelaus and Alcinous"
9109,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"are every one of them the same person playing other parts, and the"
9110,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"greater zest with which Alcinous is drawn suggests, as I have said in"
9111,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"an earlier Chapter, that the original from whom they are all taken was"
9112,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,better known to the writer in the part of Alcinous than in that of any
9113,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"of the other three. Penelope, Helen, and Arete are only one person, and"
9114,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,I always suspect Penelope to be truer to the original than either of
9115,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,the other two. Idothea and Ino are both of them Nausicaa; so also are
9116,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Circe and Calypso, only made up a little older, and doing as the writer"
9117,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,thinks Nausicaa would do if she were a goddess and had an establishment
9118,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"of her own. I am more doubtful about these two last, for they both seem"
9119,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,somewhat more free from that man-hatred which Nausicaa hardly attempts
9120,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"to conceal. Still, Nausicaa contemplates marrying as soon as she can"
9121,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"find the right person, and, as we have seen, neither Circe nor Calypso"
9122,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"had a single man-servant of their own, while Circe was in the habit of"
9123,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"turning all men who came near her into pigs or wild beasts. Calypso,"
9124,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"moreover, is only made a little angry by being compelled to send"
9125,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Ulysses away. She does not seem to have been broken-hearted about it.
9126,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Neither of them, therefore, must be held to be more fond of men than"
9127,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,the convenience of the poem dictated. Even the common people of Ithaca
9128,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"are Scherians, and make exactly the same fault-finding ill-natured"
9129,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,remarks about Penelope (xxiii. 149-151) as the Phæacians did about
9130,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Nausicaa in Book vi. 273-288.
9131,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9132,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"If, then, we observe that where the writer's invention is more laboured"
9133,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"she is describing places foreign to her own neighbourhood, while when"
9134,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"she carries conviction she is at or near her own home, the presumption"
9135,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,becomes very strong that the more spontaneous scenes are not so much
9136,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"invention as a rendering of the writer's environment, to which it is"
9137,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"plain that she is passionately attached, however much she may sometimes"
9138,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"gird at it. I, therefore, dismiss the supposition of my supposed"
9139,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,objector that the writer was not drawing Alcinous' household and garden
9140,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"from life, and am confirmed in this opinion by remembering that the"
9141,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,house of Ulysses corresponds perfectly with that of Alcinous--even to
9142,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,the number of the women servants kept in each establishment.
9143,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9144,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Being limited to a young woman who was an intimate member of Alcinous'
9145,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"household, we have only to choose between some dependant who idolised"
9146,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Nausicaa and wished to celebrate her with all her surroundings, or"
9147,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Nausicaa (whatever her real name may have been) herself. Or again,"
9148,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,it may be urged that the poem was written by some bosom friend of
9149,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Nausicaa's who was very intimate with the family, as for example"
9150,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Captain Dymas's daughter.
9151,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9152,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,The intimate friend theory may be dismissed at once. High spirited
9153,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"girls, brilliant enough to write the _Odyssey_ are not so self"
9154,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,effacing as to keep themselves entirely out of sight. If a friend had
9155,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"written the washing day episode, the friend would have come a washing"
9156,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,too--especially after having said she would in Nausicaa's dream.
9157,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9158,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"If, again, a dependant had written it, Nausicaa would neither have had"
9159,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,the heart nor the power to suppress her altogether; for if she tried
9160,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,to do so the dependant--so daring and self-willed as the writer proves
9161,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,herself to be--would have been more than a match for her mistress. We
9162,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"may be sure that there were not two such spirits in Trapani, as we"
9163,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,must suppose if we make Nausicaa able to bow the will of the authoress
9164,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"of the _Odyssey_. The fact that in the washing day episode, so far as"
9165,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"possible, we find Nausicaa, all Nausicaa, and nothing but Nausicaa,"
9166,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"among the female _dramatis personæ_, indicates that she was herself"
9167,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"the young woman of Trapani, a member of the household of King Alcinous,"
9168,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"whom we have got to find, and that she was giving herself the little"
9169,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,niche in her work which a girl who was writing such a work was sure to
9170,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,give herself.
9171,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9172,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,A dependant would not have dared to laugh at Alcinous with such
9173,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,playful malice as the writer has done. Again she would have made more
9174,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,of Nausicaa herself in the scenes that follow. At present she is left
9175,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"rather as a ragged edge, and says good bye to Ulysses in Book viii."
9176,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"460, &c., with much less detail, both as regards her own speech and"
9177,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"that of Ulysses in reply, than a courtier-like dependant would have"
9178,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,permitted. She does not hear Ulysses' account of his adventures--which
9179,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,she might perfectly well have done under her mother's wing. She does
9180,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,not appear to take her meals with the rest of the family at all. When
9181,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"she returns from washing, Eurymedusa brings her supper into her own"
9182,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"room. She is not present at any of Alcinous' banquets, nor yet at the"
9183,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"games, and her absence from the farewell scene in Book xiii. is too"
9184,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,marked to be anything but intentional. It seems as though she wished
9185,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"the reader to understand that she lived apart, and however much she"
9186,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"might enjoy an outing with her maids, would have nothing to do with the"
9187,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"men who came night after night drinking her father's best wine, and"
9188,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"making havoc of his estate. In passing, I may say that the strangeness"
9189,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,of the manner in which Nausicaa says good bye to Ulysses is one of the
9190,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,many things which convince me that the _Odyssey_ has never been recast
9191,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,by a later hand. A person recasting the work would have been tolerably
9192,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,sure to have transferred the leave-taking to Book xiii.
9193,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9194,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"Nausicaa, again, would have been more than human if she had permitted"
9195,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,any one but herself to put into her month the ill-natured talk about
9196,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,her which she alleges to pass current among the Phæacians. She would
9197,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"not mind saying it herself when her audience, private or public, would"
9198,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"know that she was doing so, but a dependant would have been requested"
9199,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,to be less pungent.
9200,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9201,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,I admit as I have already done that these arguments are not absolutely
9202,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"demonstrative, but it being, I may say, demonstrated that we must"
9203,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,choose between Nausicaa and some other young woman of Trapani who lived
9204,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"in, or was very closely intimate with, the household of King Alcinous,"
9205,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,I have no hesitation in saying that I think Nausicaa herself more
9206,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,likely than this other unknown young woman to have been the writer we
9207,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,are seeking.
9208,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9209,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Let the reader look at my frontispiece and say whether he would find
9210,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,the smallest difficulty in crediting the original of the portrait
9211,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,with being able to write the _Odyssey_. Would he refuse so to credit
9212,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,her merely because all he happened to know about her for certain was
9213,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,that she once went out washing clothes with her attendants? Nausicaa
9214,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,enjoyed a jaunt on a fine spring morning and helped her maids at the
9215,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,washing cisterns; therefore it is absurd to suppose that she could have
9216,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,written the _Odyssey_. I venture to think that this argument will carry
9217,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,little weight outside the rank and file of our Homerists--greatly as I
9218,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,dislike connecting this word however remotely with the _Odyssey_.
9219,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9220,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,No artist can reach an ideal higher than his own best actual
9221,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,environment. Trying to materially improve upon that with which he or
9222,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,she is fairly familiar invariably ends in failure. It is only adjuncts
9223,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"that may be arranged and varied--the essence may be taken or left, but"
9224,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,it must not be bettered. The attempt to take nature and be content with
9225,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"her save in respect of details which after all are unimportant, leads"
9226,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"to Donatello, Giovanni Bellini, Holbein, Rembrandt, and De Hooghe--the"
9227,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,attempt to improve upon her leads straight to Michael Angelo and the
9228,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"_barocco_, to Turner and the modern drop scene. There is not a trace of"
9229,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"the _barocco_ in my frontispiece; we may be confident, therefore, that"
9230,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"such women, though doubtless comparatively rare, yet existed, as they"
9231,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"exist in Italy now, in considerable numbers. Is it a very great stretch"
9232,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,of imagination to suppose that one among them may have shown to equal
9233,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"advantage whether as driver, washerwoman, or poetess? At the same time"
9234,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,I think it highly probable that the writer of the _Odyssey_ was both
9235,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"short and plain, and was laughing at herself, and intending to make"
9236,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"her audience laugh also, by describing herself as tall and beautiful."
9237,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,She may have been either plain or beautiful without its affecting the
9238,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,argument.
9239,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9240,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,I wish I could find some one who would give me any serious reason why
9241,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Nausicaa should not have written the _Odyssey_. For the last five years
9242,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,I have pestered every scholar with whom I have been able to scrape
9243,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"acquaintance, by asking him to explain why the _Odyssey_ should not"
9244,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,have been written by a young woman. One or two have said that they
9245,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"could see none whatever, but should not like to commit themselves to"
9246,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,a definite opinion without looking at the work again. One well-known
9247,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,and very able writer said that when he had first heard of the question
9248,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"as being mooted, he had supposed it to be some paradox of my own, but"
9249,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,on taking up the _Odyssey_ he had hardly read a hundred lines before
9250,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"he found himself saying ""Why of course it is."" The greater number,"
9251,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"however, gave me to understand that they should not find it a difficult"
9252,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,matter to expose the absurdity of my contention if they were not
9253,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"otherwise employed, but that for the present they must wish me a very"
9254,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"good morning. They gave me nothing, but to do them justice before I had"
9255,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,talked with them for five minutes I saw that they had nothing to give
9256,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"with which I was not already familiar. The _Odyssey_ is far too easy,"
9257,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"simple, and straight-forward for the understanding of scholars--as I"
9258,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"said in my _Life of Dr. Butler of Shrewsbury_, if it had been harder"
9259,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"to understand, it would have been sooner understood--and yet I do not"
9260,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"know; the _Iliad_ is indeed much harder to understand, but scholars"
9261,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,seem to have been very sufficiently able to misunderstand it.
9262,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,
9263,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Every scholar has read a Book or two of the _Odyssey_ here and there;
9264,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,some have read the whole; a few have read it through more than once;
9265,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,but none that I have asked have so much as been able to tell me whether
9266,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,Ulysses had a sister or no--much less what her name was. Not one of
9267,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,those whom I have as yet had the good fortune to meet in England--for I
9268,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"have met with such in Sicily--have saturated themselves with the poem,"
9269,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,"and that, too, unhampered by a single preconceived idea in connection"
9270,WHO WAS THE WRITER?,with it. Nothing short of this is of the smallest use.

9288,B.C.,B.C.
9289,B.C.,
9290,B.C.,"I see that I may claim Professor Jebb's authority as to some extent, at"
9291,B.C.,"any rate, supporting the later of these two dates. He writes:--"
9292,B.C.,
9293,B.C.,"With regard to the age of the _Odyssey_, we may suppose"
9294,B.C.,"that the original ""Return"" was composed in Greece Proper"
9295,B.C.,"as early as the Eleventh Century B.C., and that the first"
9296,B.C.,enlargement had been made before 850 B.C.[1]
9297,B.C.,
9298,B.C.,I have shown why I cannot admit that any part of the _Odyssey_ was
9299,B.C.,"written in Greece Proper, and while admitting that the poem has been"
9300,B.C.,obviously enlarged by the addition of Books i.-iv. and line 187 of
9301,B.C.,"Book xiii.-xxiv., with which I will deal fully in a later Chapter--I"
9302,B.C.,cannot think that the enlargement was by another hand than that of the
9303,B.C.,authoress of the poem in its original form. Nevertheless I am glad
9304,B.C.,"to claim Professor Jebb's support as far as it goes, for dating the"
9305,B.C.,inception of the _Odyssey_ as in the eleventh century B.C.
9306,B.C.,
9307,B.C.,I will begin by giving my reasons for thinking that the _Odyssey_ must
9308,B.C.,at any rate be earlier than 734 B.C.
9309,B.C.,
9310,B.C.,When Eumæus is telling the story of his childhood to Ulysses (xv. 403
9311,B.C.,"&c.), he says that he was born in the Syrian island over against"
9312,B.C.,"Ortygia, and I have rendered ""the Syrian island"" ""the island of Syra,"""
9313,B.C.,"guided by the analogy of the ""Psyrian island"" (iii. 171), which"
9314,B.C.,unquestionably means the island of Psyra.
9315,B.C.,
9316,B.C.,"The connection of an island Syra with a land Ortygia, suggests"
9317,B.C.,"Syracuse, in spite of the fact that in reality Ortygia was an island,"
9318,B.C.,and Syracuse both on the island and on the adjacent mainland--for as I
9319,B.C.,have already too often said all Sicilian places in the _Odyssey_ are
9320,B.C.,"travestied, however thinly."
9321,B.C.,
9322,B.C.,The impression that Syracuse[2] is being alluded to is deepened by our
9323,B.C.,"going on to read that ""the turnings of the sun"" are ""there""--which I"
9324,B.C.,"presume may be extended so as to mean ""thereabouts."" Now what are ""the"
9325,B.C.,"turnings of the sun""? I looked in Liddell and Scott, for whose work no"
9326,B.C.,"one can feel a more cordial admiration, nor deeper sense of gratitude,"
9327,B.C.,"and found that the turnings of the sun are ""the solstices, or tropics,"
9328,B.C.,"_i.e_., the turning points of midsummer and midwinter."" This may do"
9329,B.C.,"very well as regards time, but not as regards place. In reference to"
9330,B.C.,"the Odyssean passage, I read that ""the turning of the sun denotes a"
9331,B.C.,"point in the heavens probably to the Westward."""
9332,B.C.,
9333,B.C.,"But we want the sun to turn not at a point in the heavens, but in the"
9334,B.C.,"neighbourhood of Syra and Ortygia, and to do so here in a way that he"
9335,B.C.,does not do elsewhere. The simplest way of attaining this end will be
9336,B.C.,to suppose that the writer of the _Odyssey_ was adopting a form of
9337,B.C.,"speech which we often use on a railway journey, when we say that the"
9338,B.C.,sun has turned and is coming in at the other window--meaning that the
9339,B.C.,"line has taken a sharp turn, and that we are going in a new direction."
9340,B.C.,Surely I am not wrong in thinking that the author meant nothing more
9341,B.C.,recondite than that near the two places named the land turns sharply
9342,B.C.,"round, so that sailors who follow it will find the sun on the other"
9343,B.C.,side of their ship from what it has hitherto been.
9344,B.C.,
9345,B.C.,A glance at the map will show that the site which the combination of
9346,B.C.,Syra and Ortygia has suggested is confirmed by the fact that shortly
9347,B.C.,"South of it the coast of Sicily turns abruptly round, and continues"
9348,B.C.,thenceforward in a new direction. Indeed it begins to turn sharply with
9349,B.C.,"the promontory of Plemmyrium itself. Eumæus, therefore, should be taken"
9350,B.C.,"as indicating that he was born at the place which we know as Syracuse,"
9351,B.C.,"and which was then, so he says, an aggregate of two small towns,"
9352,B.C.,without many inhabitants. It seems to have been a quiet easy-going
9353,B.C.,"little place, where every one had enough to eat and drink, and nobody"
9354,B.C.,"died except of sheer old age, diseases of all kinds being unknown."
9355,B.C.,"Business must have been carried on in a very leisurely fashion, for"
9356,B.C.,"it took the Phœnicians a twelvemonth to freight their vessel, and the"
9357,B.C.,largest ship of those times cannot have been very large.
9358,B.C.,
9359,B.C.,"This is not the description of a busy newly founded settlement, as"
9360,B.C.,Syracuse would be in 734 B.C. Still less will it apply to any later
9361,B.C.,Syracusan age. The writer modernises when dealing with an earlier age
9362,B.C.,as frankly as Shakspeare: I have never detected a trace in her of any
9363,B.C.,"archæological instinct. I believe, therefore, that she was telling what"
9364,B.C.,"little she knew of the Syracuse of her own day, and that that day was"
9365,B.C.,one prior to the arrival of the Corinthian Colony. I think it likely
9366,B.C.,also that she made Eumæus come from Syracuse because she felt that she
9367,B.C.,rather ought to have done something at Syracuse during the voyage of
9368,B.C.,"Ulysses, but could not well, under the circumstances, break his journey"
9369,B.C.,"between Charybdis and Calypso's Island. She, therefore, took some other"
9370,B.C.,way of bringing Syracuse into her story.
9371,B.C.,
9372,B.C.,It may be urged that we have no other evidence of any considerable
9373,B.C.,civilisation as having existed at Syracuse before the one founded by
9374,B.C.,"the Corinthians, and as regards written evidence this is true, so"
9375,B.C.,far at least as I know; but we have unwritten evidence of an even
9376,B.C.,more conclusive kind. The remains of pottery and implements found
9377,B.C.,"at, or in the near neighbourhood of, Syracuse go back in an unbroken"
9378,B.C.,"line from post-Roman times to the age of stone, while commerce with"
9379,B.C.,"the Peloponese, at any rate from the Mycenæan age, is shown by the"
9380,B.C.,forms and materials of the objects discovered in countless tombs. I
9381,B.C.,had the advantage of being shown over the Museum at Syracuse by Dr.
9382,B.C.,"Orsi, than whom there can be no more cautious and capable guide on"
9383,B.C.,"all matters connected with the earliest history of Sicily, and he"
9384,B.C.,repeatedly insisted on the remoteness of the age at which commerce must
9385,B.C.,"have existed between the South East, and indeed all the East, coast"
9386,B.C.,"of Sicily, and the Peloponese. The notion, therefore, too generally"
9387,B.C.,"held in the very face of Thucydides himself, that there were no people"
9388,B.C.,living at or near Syracuse till the arrival of the Corinthians must be
9389,B.C.,"abandoned, and I believe we may feel confident that in the story of"
9390,B.C.,Eumæus we have a peep into its condition in pre-Corinthian times.
9391,B.C.,
9392,B.C.,"The two communities of which Eumæus tells us were probably, one, on"
9393,B.C.,"the promontory of Plemmyrium, and the other, at a place between three"
9394,B.C.,"and four miles distant, now called Cozzo Pantano, on each of which"
9395,B.C.,sites Dr. Orsi has discovered the burying ground of an extensive
9396,B.C.,village or town (_borgo_) to which he had assigned the date xii.-xi.
9397,B.C.,centuries B.C. before his attention had been called to the existence
9398,B.C.,of a reference to prehistoric Syracuse in the _Odyssey_. Many examples
9399,B.C.,of implements found on these two sites may be seen in the museum at
9400,B.C.,Syracuse. I did not gather that any other prehistoric burying grounds
9401,B.C.,had been found at or in close proximity to Syracuse.
9402,B.C.,
9403,B.C.,Whether the people whose burying grounds have been found at the above
9404,B.C.,"named places were Greeks, who were displaced later by Sicels, as the"
9405,B.C.,"Sicels in their turn were displaced by the Corinthians, or whether they"
9406,B.C.,"were Sicels of an earlier unrecorded immigration, I must leave Dr."
9407,B.C.,"Orsi and others to determine, but the name of the sea which washes the"
9408,B.C.,East coast of Sicily points to the existence at one time of extensive
9409,B.C.,"Ionian settlements on East Sicilian shores. The name, again, Aci, which"
9410,B.C.,"is found in _Aci reale, Aci Castello_, and _Aci trezza_, and which"
9411,B.C.,"among the common people is now always sounded Iaci, suggests a remote"
9412,B.C.,Ionian origin--for we may assume that there was no Ionian migration
9413,B.C.,later than 734 B.C. of sufficient importance to give the name Ionian to
9414,B.C.,"Sicilian waters, towns, and islands. The reader will be reminded in the"
9415,B.C.,following Chapter that Ἰακός means Ionian.
9416,B.C.,
9417,B.C.,Eumæus was so young when he was carried off that even though Greek was
9418,B.C.,"not his native language, he would have become Grecised in a few years;"
9419,B.C.,"I incline to think, however, that the writer of the _Odyssey_ would"
9420,B.C.,have said something about his being a Sicel if she had so conceived of
9421,B.C.,him in her own mind. She seems to think of him as a Greek by birth.
9422,B.C.,
9423,B.C.,"The Sicels, however, also probably spoke Greek. The inhabitants of"
9424,B.C.,"Temesa, on the toe of Italy, do not indeed seem to have done so (_Od_."
9425,B.C.,i. 183); but we do not know that they were Sicels. No writing has been
9426,B.C.,found at Plemmirio nor yet at Cozzo Pantano; we have therefore very
9427,B.C.,little to go upon.
9428,B.C.,
9429,B.C.,But postulating that we may accept Thucydides--whose accuracy as
9430,B.C.,regards Syracusan details proves that even though he had not been at
9431,B.C.,"Syracuse himself, he had at any rate means of informing himself on"
9432,B.C.,"Sicilian history--who is evidently taking pains, and whose reputation"
9433,B.C.,is surpassed by that of no other historian--postulating that we may
9434,B.C.,accept his statement (vi. 2) that the great irruption of Sicels which
9435,B.C.,changed the name of the country from Sicania to Sicelia took place
9436,B.C.,"about 300 years before B.C. 734, I think we may safely put back the"
9437,B.C.,date of the _Odyssey_ to a time before B.C. 1000.
9438,B.C.,
9439,B.C.,For the _Odyssey_ conveys no impression as though Sicily at large had
9440,B.C.,"been lately subdued and overrun by Sicels. Locally, indeed, the city"
9441,B.C.,"at the top of Mt. Eryx had, as we have seen (_Od_. vii. 60), been"
9442,B.C.,"conquered and overthrown; but I shall bring Thucydides, as well as"
9443,B.C.,"other evidence, to show that in this case the victors are more likely"
9444,B.C.,to have been Asiatic Greeks than Sicels. The poem indicates a time of
9445,B.C.,"profound present peace and freedom from apprehension, and on the one"
9446,B.C.,"occasion in which the writer speaks of Sicily under its own name, she"
9447,B.C.,calls it by its pre-Sicelian name of Sicania.[3] The old Sicel woman
9448,B.C.,who waited on Laertes (xxiv. 211 and elsewhere) is not spoken of as
9449,B.C.,though there were any ill-will on the part of the writer towards the
9450,B.C.,"Sicels, or as though they were a dominant race. Lastly, one of the"
9451,B.C.,suitors (xx. 382) advises Telemachus to ship Theoclymenus and Ulysses
9452,B.C.,"off to the Sicels. Now if the writer had the real Ithaca in her mind,"
9453,B.C.,"the Sicels could only have been reached by sea, whether they were in"
9454,B.C.,Italy or Sicily; but I have already shown that she never pictured to
9455,B.C.,herself any other Ithaca than the one she had created at Trapani; the
9456,B.C.,"fact, therefore, that Theoclymenus and Ulysses were to be put on board"
9457,B.C.,"ship before they could reach the Sicels, shows that she imagined these"
9458,B.C.,last as (except for an occasional emigrant) outside the limits of her
9459,B.C.,own island.
9460,B.C.,
9461,B.C.,"If the foregoing reasoning is admitted, 1050 B.C. will be about as late"
9462,B.C.,as it is safe to place the date of the _Odyssey_; but a few years later
9463,B.C.,"is possible, though hardly, I think, probable. Unfortunately this date"
9464,B.C.,will compel us to remove the fall of Troy to a time very considerably
9465,B.C.,"earlier than the received date. For a hundred years is, one would"
9466,B.C.,"think, the shortest interval that can be allowed between the _Odyssey_"
9467,B.C.,"and the _Iliad_. The development of myth and of the Epic cycle, of"
9468,B.C.,"which we find abundant traces in the _Odyssey_, is too considerable to"
9469,B.C.,render any shorter period probable. I therefore conclude that 1150 B.C.
9470,B.C.,is the latest date to which we should assign the _Iliad_.
9471,B.C.,
9472,B.C.,The usually received date for the fall of Troy is 1184 B.C. This is
9473,B.C.,arrived at from a passage in Thucydides (i. 12) which says that sixty
9474,B.C.,"years after the fall of Troy, the Bœotians were driven from Arne and"
9475,B.C.,"settled in what was originally called Cadmeis, but subsequently Bœotia."
9476,B.C.,"Twenty years later, he tells us, the Dorians and the Heraclidæ became"
9477,B.C.,"masters of the Peloponese; but as he does not fix this last date,"
9478,B.C.,"probably because he could not, so neither does he fix that of the fall"
9479,B.C.,of Troy.
9480,B.C.,
9481,B.C.,The date commonly accepted for the return of the Heraclidæ and their
9482,B.C.,"conquest of the Peloponese is 1104,[4] but those who turn to Müller's"
9483,B.C.,"_History of the Doric Race_,[5] Vol. I., p. 53, will see that there is"
9484,B.C.,no authority for this date which is worth a moment's consideration; and
9485,B.C.,"with the failure of authority here, we are left absolutely without"
9486,B.C.,authority for 1184 B.C. as the date of the fall of Troy.
9487,B.C.,
9488,B.C.,Admitting for the moment 1150 B.C. as the latest date to which we
9489,B.C.,"should assign the _Iliad_, the question arises: How much later than"
9490,B.C.,the fall of Troy did Homer write? Mr. Gladstone has argued very ably
9491,B.C.,in support of the view that he wrote only some forty or fifty years
9492,B.C.,"after the events he is recording, in which case it would seem that"
9493,B.C.,he must date the _Iliad_ hardly at all later than the latest date
9494,B.C.,"to which I would assign it, for he does not appear to dispute the"
9495,B.C.,"received date for the fall of Troy, though he does not say that he"
9496,B.C.,accepts it. I should be only too glad to find that I can claim Mr.
9497,B.C.,"Gladstone's support so far, but farther I cannot expect to do so; for"
9498,B.C.,the impression left upon me by the _Iliad_ is that Homer was writing of
9499,B.C.,a time that was to him much what the middle ages are to ourselves.
9500,B.C.,
9501,B.C.,"If he had lived as near the Trojan War as Mr. Gladstone supposes, he"
9502,B.C.,"would surely have given us some hint of the manner in which Troy fell,"
9503,B.C.,whereas he shows no signs of knowing more than the bare fact that the
9504,B.C.,"city had fallen. He repeatedly tells us this much, but always more"
9505,B.C.,"curtly and drily than we should expect him to do, and his absolute"
9506,B.C.,"silence as to the way in which the capture of the city was effected,"
9507,B.C.,goes far to prove either that all record of the _modus in quo_ had
9508,B.C.,perished--which would point to a very considerable lapse of time--or
9509,B.C.,"else to suggest a fact which, though I have often thought it possible,"
9510,B.C.,"I hardly dare to write--I mean that Troy never fell at all, or at any"
9511,B.C.,"rate that it did not fall with the close of the Trojan War, and that"
9512,B.C.,Homer knew this perfectly well.
9513,B.C.,
9514,B.C.,The infinite subtlety of the _Iliad_ is almost as unfathomable as the
9515,B.C.,"simplicity of the _Odyssey_ has so far proved itself to be, and its"
9516,B.C.,"author, writing for a Greek audience whom he obviously despised, and"
9517,B.C.,whom he was fooling to the top of their bent though always sailing
9518,B.C.,"far enough off the wind to avoid disaster, would take very good care"

9520,B.C.,"won the battle of Waterloo, though he very well knew that it was"
9521,B.C.,won by Wellington. It is certain that no even tolerably plausible
9522,B.C.,account of the fall of Troy existed among the Greeks themselves;
9523,B.C.,all plausibility ends with their burning their tents and sailing away

9541,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],that this is the Iliadic wall may be taken as certain) was built in

9547,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],I see by the latest work on the subject[6] that Dr. Dörpfeld dates it

9564,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"be as near the truth as anything that we are likely to get, and will"
9565,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"bring the archæological evidence as derivable from the wall of Troy,"
9566,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"the internal evidence of the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_, the statement of"
9567,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Thucydides that the last and greatest inroad of the Sicels occurred
9568,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"about 1030 B.C., and our conclusion that the _Odyssey_ was written"
9569,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"before that date, into line with one another."
9570,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9571,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],The date 1050 B.C. will explain the absence of all allusion in the

9608,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9609,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],In the _Odyssey_ we have seen the Sicans (whom I think that I have
9610,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],sufficiently identified) as originally in possession of Mt. Eryx under
9611,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"a king whose Odyssean name is Eurymedon. He, it seems, was overthrown,"
9612,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"and the power of his people was broken, by enemies whose name is not"

9616,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9617,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"The writer of the _Odyssey_ wrote in a language mainly Ionian, but"
9618,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"containing a considerable Æolian element. It must be inferred,"
9619,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"therefore, that her family and audience--that is to say the"
9620,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Phæacians--spoke a dialect in which these characteristics are to be
9621,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],found. The place of all others where such a dialect might be looked
9622,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"for is Phocæa, a little South of the Troad; for Phocæa was an Ionian"
9623,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],city entirely surrounded on its land sides by Æolian territory. I see
9624,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],from Professor Jebb's _Introduction to Homer_[8] that Aristarchus
9625,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"when editing the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_, and settling the text to all"
9626,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"intents and purposes as we now have it, by comparison of the best"
9627,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"copies known, made most frequent use of the civic edition of Marseilles"
9628,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],which contained both _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_. It will be remembered that
9629,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Marseilles was a Phocæan Colony.
9630,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9631,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],The name Phæacians is not unsuggestive of a thin disguise for Phocæans;
9632,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"lines iv. 441-443, moreover, will gain greatly in point, if we imagine"
9633,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"that the seals, or Phocæ, with their disgusting smell, are meant for"
9634,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"the writer's countrymen whom she evidently dislikes, and that the"
9635,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"words, ""who, indeed, would go to bed with a sea monster if he could"
9636,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"help it?"" are her rejoinder to the alleged complaint of the young"
9637,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Phæacians that she would marry none of them (vi. 276 &c.). Apart,"
9638,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"therefore, from any external evidence, I should suspect the Phæacians"
9639,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"to have been Phocæans, who had settled on this part of the island.[9]"
9640,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],From the fact that the Phæacians in the time of the _Odyssey_ were
9641,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"evidently dominant on Mt. Eryx as well as at Trapani, I conclude that"
9642,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"they must have had, to say the least of it, a considerable share in"
9643,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],the overthrow of Eurymedon and of the Sican power in that part of the
9644,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"island. If they had allies with them, these allies seem to have gone on"
9645,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"to other sites on which Elymite cities are known to have existed, for"
9646,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],we find no reference in the _Odyssey_ to any other people as sharing
9647,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Hypereia and Scheria with the Phæacians.
9648,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9649,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Though the power of the Sicans at Eryx was broken, and the Phæacians"
9650,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"were established at Hypereia, also on the top of Mt. Eryx and less"
9651,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"than a mile from the Sican city, the Sicans were still troublesome"
9652,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"neighbours; there seems, however, to have been a marriage between some"
9653,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"chief man among the Phæacians and Peribœa, youngest daughter of the old"
9654,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"king Eurymedon, and this no doubt would lead to some approach to fusion"
9655,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"between the two peoples. The offspring of this marriage, Nausithous,"
9656,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"is said in the poem to have been by Neptune, from which I infer that"
9657,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"the marriage may have been of a more or less irregular kind, but there"
9658,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],can be no doubt that Nausithous came of a Phæacian father and would
9659,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"speak the Phæacian dialect, which the Sicans, though in all probability"
9660,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"a Greek-speaking race, cannot be supposed to have done. Nausithous"
9661,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],seems to have been a capable man; finding the continued raids of
9662,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"semi-outlawed Sicans still harassing, perhaps, also, induced by the"
9663,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],fact that the promontory on which Trapani stands was better suited to
9664,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"a race of mariners than the lofty and inhospitable top of Mt. Eryx,"
9665,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],he moved his people down to the seaside and founded the city that now
9666,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"bears the name of Trapani--retaining, however, the site of Hypereia as"
9667,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"his own property on which his pigs and goats would feed, and to which"
9668,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"also his family would resort, as the people of Trapani still do, during"
9669,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],the excessive heat of summer.
9670,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9671,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"The reader will have noted that Eumæus, who we must never forget is"
9672,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"drawn not from Ithaca but from Mt. Eryx, when watching over his pigs by"
9673,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],night thought it necessary to be fully armed (xiv. 526). He seems also
9674,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"from xvi. 9, to have had neighbours, from which we may infer that the"
9675,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"old Sican city of Eryx was not yet entirely abandoned; nevertheless,"
9676,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Eumæus would not be there at all unless the fusion between the Sicans
9677,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],and the Phocæans had been fairly complete. The Sicans appear in the
9678,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"_Odyssey_ under the names of Cyclopes and Læstrygonians, and the Sicels"
9679,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],are not yet come. This is all that we can collect from the _Odyssey_.
9680,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9681,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],We will now see what support the sketch given above will derive
9682,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],from Thucydides (vi. 2). According to him the Læstrygonians and the
9683,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Cyclopes, mentioned as the earliest inhabitants of Sicily, are mere"
9684,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"poetical fictions. This, however, does not preclude their having had"
9685,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],their prototype in some real Sicilian people who bore another name; and
9686,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"at any rate, however fictitious they may be, he locates them in Sicily."
9687,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9688,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],He continues that the oldest historic inhabitants of the island
9689,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"were the Sicans, who by their own account had been there from time"
9690,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"immemorial. This he denies, for he says they were Iberians, and he says"
9691,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"it as though he had satisfied himself after due inquiry, but since he"
9692,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"gives no hint as to the date of their arrival, he does not impugn their"
9693,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],statement that their settlement in the island dated from a remote time.
9694,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],It is most likely that he is right about the Sicans having come from
9695,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Spain; and indeed at Tarragona, some fifty or sixty miles North of the"
9696,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"mouth of the river Iberus, there are megalithic walls that bear, so"
9697,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"far as I can judge from photographs, a very considerable analogy with"
9698,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],those of Eryx. In Thucydides' own times there were still Sicans in the
9699,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Western part of Sicily.
9700,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9701,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"He then goes on to say that after the fall of Troy, but he does not say"
9702,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"how much after, some of the Trojans who had escaped the Greeks migrated"
9703,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],to Sicily. They settled in the neighbourhood of the Sicans and were all
9704,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"together called Elymi, their cities being Eryx and Segesta. There were"
9705,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"also settled with them--but whether at the same date, or earlier or"
9706,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"later, and if so, how much, Thucydides does not say--certain Phocians"
9707,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"of the Trojan branch, _i.e_., Phocæans--Phocæa having been founded by"
9708,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Phocians from the gulf of Corinth under the leadership of the Athenian
9709,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"chiefs Philogenes and Damon (_Strab_. xiv. § 633; _Pausan_. VII. 3,"
9710,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"§5; cf. _Herod_, I. 146). These Phocæans had been carried first by a"
9711,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"tempest to Libya,[10] and thence to Sicily."
9712,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9713,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"We need not follow him to the arrival of the Sicels, for I have"
9714,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"already, I hope, satisfied the reader that the _Odyssey_ belongs to"
9715,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"a pre-Sicelian age, and I am only dealing with the period which the"
9716,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],_Odyssey_ and Thucydides cover in common.
9717,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9718,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],I should perhaps put it beyond doubt that Thucydides means Phocæans
9719,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],and not Phocians. In the first place it is difficult to understand
9720,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"how Phocians, who were on the Achæan side (_Il_. II. 518), should"
9721,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],amalgamate with Trojans; and in the next Thucydides' words cannot be
9722,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"made to bear the meaning that is generally put upon them, as though the"
9723,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Phocians in question were on their way back from Troy to Phocis. His
9724,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"words are Φωκέων τινες τῶν ἀπὸ Τροίας, and this cannot be construed as"
9725,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],though he had said Φωκέων τινες τῶν ἀνερχομένων ἐν νόστῳ ἀπὸ Τροίας.
9726,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"If ἀπό is to imply motion from, it should have a verb or participle"
9727,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],involving motion before it; without this it is a common way of
9728,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"expressing residence in a place. For example, Ὀρέστης ἤλυθεν ... ἀπ᾽"
9729,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Ἀθηνάων (iii. 307) means Orestes came from Athens, whereas Ὀρέστης"
9730,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"ὁ ἀπ᾽ Ἀθηνάων would mean ""Orestes the Athenian, or quasi-Athenian,"""
9731,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"as Λακεδαιμόνιοι οἱ ἀπὸ Σπάρτης means ""the Lacedæmonians who live"
9732,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"at Sparta."" Neither of these last two passages can be made to bear"
9733,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"the meaning ""Orestes, who was on his way from Athens,"" or ""the"
9734,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Lacedæmonians, who were on their way from Sparta."" The reader who"
9735,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],looks out ἀπὸ in Liddell & Scott will find plenty of examples. To
9736,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Thucydides, Phocæans in Asia Minor and Phocians on the gulf of Corinth"
9737,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"would be alike Phocians in virtue of common descent, but to avoid"
9738,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"misapprehension he calls the Phocæans ""Phocians of the Trojan stock,"""
9739,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"by ""Trojan"" meaning not very far from Troy. It should be noted that"
9740,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"the Phocians of the gulf of Corinth are called Φωκῆες, not Φωκέες in"
9741,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"_Il_. IX. 517, XV. 516, XVII. 307. I see that Dobree (_Adversaria"
9742,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],in Thucyd_.) is suspicious of the reading Φωκέων in the passage of
9743,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Thucydides which we are now considering. He evidently considers that
9744,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Φωκέων must mean Phocians from the gulf of Corinth, and so it would, if"
9745,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],it were not qualified by the words τῶν ἀπὸ Τροίας which negative the
9746,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],possibility of European Phocians being intended.
9747,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9748,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Thucydides says nothing about any invasion of Sicily by a people called
9749,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Elymi. He does not see the Elymi as anything more than the combined
9750,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Asiatic and Sican peoples, who came to be called Elymi. If he had"
9751,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],believed in the Elymi as a distinct batch of immigrants he would have
9752,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],given us a line or two more about them.
9753,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9754,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],It is just possible that the known connection between Phocians and
9755,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Phocæans may explain why Ulysses' maternal grandfather should have been
9756,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"made to live on Mt. Parnassus,[11] which is in Phocis. Ulysses, to the"
9757,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"writer of the _Odyssey_, was a naturalised Phæacian, for her native"
9758,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],town had become in her eyes both Scheria and Ithaca. It would not be
9759,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"unnatural, therefore, that she should wish to connect his ancestry with"
9760,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Phocis, the ancestral seat of the Phocæans."
9761,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9762,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Returning to Thucydides, the only point in which he varies the"
9763,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Odyssean version is that he makes other Trojans migrate to Eryx as
9764,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"well as the Phocæans, whereas the writer of the _Odyssey_ mentions"
9765,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],only the Phæacians without saying anything about their having been of
9766,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Phocæan descent. She has, however, betrayed herself very sufficiently."
9767,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Thucydides again does not tell us that the Phocæans re-settled
9768,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"themselves at Drepanum, but a man who is giving a mere outline of"
9769,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"events which happened some seven hundred years before he was writing,"
9770,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],can hardly be expected to give so small a detail as this. The wonder is
9771,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],that the _Odyssey_ should bear him out and confirm his accuracy in so
9772,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"striking a way as it does. We now, therefore, see that instead of there"
9773,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],being any cause for surprise at finding an Ionic-Æolian poem written
9774,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"near Mt. Eryx, this is the very neighbourhood in which we might expect"
9775,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],to find one.
9776,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],
9777,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Finally, let us turn to Virgil. His authority as a historian is"
9778,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"worthless, but we cannot suppose that he would make Æneas apparently"
9779,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"found Drepanum, if he held the presence of a Greek-speaking people at"
9780,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],Drepanum even before the age of Homer to be so absurd as it appears to
9781,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"our eminent Homeric scholars. I say ""apparently found Drepanum,"" for it"
9782,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],is not quite easy to fix the site of the city founded by Æneas (_Æn_ v.
9783,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"755-761), for at the close of _Æn_. III. Anchises dies at Drepanum, as"
9784,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],though this city was already in existence. But whether the city founded
9785,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"by Æneas was actually Drepanum, or another city hard by it, it is clear"
9786,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"that Virgil places Greek-speaking people at Drepanum, or close to it,"
9787,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],immediately after the fall of Troy. He would hardly do this unless
9788,AND PROTECTED COURSES.],"Drepanum was believed in his time to be a city of very great antiquity,"

9840,TO TRAPANI.,TO TRAPANI.
9841,TO TRAPANI.,
9842,TO TRAPANI.,
9843,TO TRAPANI.,I am often asked how I explain the fact that we find no trace in
9844,TO TRAPANI.,ancient authors of any tradition to the effect that the _Odyssey_ was
9845,TO TRAPANI.,written at Drepanum or that the writer was a woman. This difficulty
9846,TO TRAPANI.,"is laid before me as one that is almost fatal. I confess, however,"
9847,TO TRAPANI.,that I find it small in comparison with that of explaining how both
9848,TO TRAPANI.,these facts should have failed of being long since rediscovered.
9849,TO TRAPANI.,"Neptune indeed did not overwhelm Scheria under Mt. Eryx, but he, or"
9850,TO TRAPANI.,"some not less spiteful god, seems to have buried both it and its great"
9851,TO TRAPANI.,poetess under another mountain which I fear may be found even more
9852,TO TRAPANI.,irremoveable--I mean a huge quasi-geological formation of academic
9853,TO TRAPANI.,erudition.
9854,TO TRAPANI.,
9855,TO TRAPANI.,The objection is without sufficient foundation in its implied facts;
9856,TO TRAPANI.,for that the Phæacians were a real people who lived at a place bearing
9857,TO TRAPANI.,the name of Drepane (which is near enough to Drepanum for all practical
9858,TO TRAPANI.,"purposes),[1] has never been lost sight of at all--except by those who"
9859,TO TRAPANI.,find it convenient to lose sight of it. Thucydides (i. 25) tells us
9860,TO TRAPANI.,"that the inhabitants of Corfu were the descendants of the Phæacians,"
9861,TO TRAPANI.,and the rock into which their ship was turned as it was entering the
9862,TO TRAPANI.,harbour after having escorted Ulysses to Ithaca is still shown at
9863,TO TRAPANI.,Corfu--as an island 58 feet high with a monastery on the top of it.
9864,TO TRAPANI.,"But the older name of Corfu was Drepane,[2] and when the Carthaginians"
9865,TO TRAPANI.,"had established themselves at the Sicilian Drepanum, it would be an"
9866,TO TRAPANI.,easy matter for the inhabitants of the Corfu Drepane to claim Phæacian
9867,TO TRAPANI.,"descent, and--as they proceeded to do--to call their island Scheria,"
9868,TO TRAPANI.,in spite of its offering no single point of correspondence with the
9869,TO TRAPANI.,description given in the _Odyssey_.
9870,TO TRAPANI.,
9871,TO TRAPANI.,I grant that no explicit tradition exists to the effect that the
9872,TO TRAPANI.,"_Odyssey_ as a whole was written at or in Corfu, but the Phæacian"
9873,TO TRAPANI.,"episode is the eye of the poem. I submit, then, that tradition both"
9874,TO TRAPANI.,"long has, and still does, by implication connect it with a place of"
9875,TO TRAPANI.,which the earliest known name was to all intents and purposes the same
9876,TO TRAPANI.,as that of the town where I contend that it was written.
9877,TO TRAPANI.,
9878,TO TRAPANI.,"The Athenian writers, Thucydides included, would be biassed in favour"
9879,TO TRAPANI.,"of any site which brought Homer, as they ignorantly called the writer"
9880,TO TRAPANI.,"of the _Odyssey_, nearer their own doors. The people, moreover, of Eryx"
9881,TO TRAPANI.,"and Segesta, and hence also of Drepanum, were held to be barbarians,"
9882,TO TRAPANI.,and are so called by Thucydides himself (vi. 2); in his eyes it would
9883,TO TRAPANI.,be little less than sacrilege to hesitate between the Corfu Drepane and
9884,TO TRAPANI.,"the Sicilian Drepanum, did any tradition, however vague, support Corfu."
9885,TO TRAPANI.,But it is not likely that Thucydides was unaware of the Sicilian claim
9886,TO TRAPANI.,"not only to the Phæacian episode, but to the entire poem, for as late"
9887,TO TRAPANI.,"as 430 B.C., only a little before the date of his own work, there were"
9888,TO TRAPANI.,still people on or near Mt. Eryx who present every appearance of having
9889,TO TRAPANI.,"claimed it, as I will almost immediately show."
9890,TO TRAPANI.,
9891,TO TRAPANI.,"As for losing sight of its having been written by a woman, the people"
9892,TO TRAPANI.,who could lose sight of the impossibility of its having been written
9893,TO TRAPANI.,by Homer could lose sight of anything. A people who could not only do
9894,TO TRAPANI.,"this, but who could effectually snuff out those who pointed out their"
9895,TO TRAPANI.,"error, were not likely to know more about the difference underlying the"
9896,TO TRAPANI.,two poems than the average English layman does about those between the
9897,TO TRAPANI.,synoptic gospels and that of St. John.
9898,TO TRAPANI.,
9899,TO TRAPANI.,I will now return to my assertion that in the time of Thucydides there
9900,TO TRAPANI.,"seem to have been not a few who knew of, and shared in, the claim of"
9901,TO TRAPANI.,Drepanum to the authorship of the _Odyssey_.
9902,TO TRAPANI.,
9903,TO TRAPANI.,The British Museum possesses a unique example of a small bronze coin
9904,TO TRAPANI.,which is classed with full confidence among those of Eryx and Segesta.
9905,TO TRAPANI.,"It is of the very finest period of the numismatic art, and is dated by"
9906,TO TRAPANI.,the museum authorities as about 430 B.C.
9907,TO TRAPANI.,
9908,TO TRAPANI.,[Illustration: Enlarged to about double the actual diameter.]
9909,TO TRAPANI.,
9910,TO TRAPANI.,"The reader will see that the obverse bears the legend IAKIN, and the"
9911,TO TRAPANI.,reverse a representation of the brooch described by Ulysses (_Od_. xix.
9912,TO TRAPANI.,225-231). A translation of this passage is given on page 80. (Search for:
9913,TO TRAPANI.,"""I will tell you,"" replied Ulysses)"
9914,TO TRAPANI.,
9915,TO TRAPANI.,"The cross line of the A is not visible in the original, but no doubt is"
9916,TO TRAPANI.,felt at the Museum about its having existed.
9917,TO TRAPANI.,
9918,TO TRAPANI.,"There seems, however, to be more doubt whether the legend should be"
9919,TO TRAPANI.,"IAKIN, or ΓIAKIN--Γ being the older form of Π. Possibly from a desire"
9920,TO TRAPANI.,"to be right in either case, the Museum catalogue gives it as IAKIN in"
9921,TO TRAPANI.,"the illustration, and ΓIAKIN in the descriptive letterpress. The one"
9922,TO TRAPANI.,"reading will do nearly as well as the other for my argument, which only"
9923,TO TRAPANI.,requires that the coin should belong to the Eryx and Segesta group and
9924,TO TRAPANI.,"be dated about 430 B.C.--neither of which points are doubted. I will,"
9925,TO TRAPANI.,"however, give the reasons that convince me that IAKIN is the true"
9926,TO TRAPANI.,reading.
9927,TO TRAPANI.,
9928,TO TRAPANI.,"Firstly, neither I nor some artist friends of mine whose opinion is"
9929,TO TRAPANI.,"infinitely better worth having than my own, can find any traces of a Γ"
9930,TO TRAPANI.,between the lowermost boss and the neck. I am aware that some experts
9931,TO TRAPANI.,"of the highest competence profess to be able to detect such traces, but"
9932,TO TRAPANI.,the artist who figured the coin in the Museum Catalogue evidently could
9933,TO TRAPANI.,"not do so, and the experts do not seem to have had such confidence in"
9934,TO TRAPANI.,their own opinion as to make him alter his drawing.
9935,TO TRAPANI.,
9936,TO TRAPANI.,"Secondly, the composition is obviously and intentionally symmetrical."
9937,TO TRAPANI.,It would be abhorrent to the instincts of the man who could design so
9938,TO TRAPANI.,exquisite a coin to destroy its balance by crowding a Γ into the place
9939,TO TRAPANI.,which must be assigned to it if it exists at all.
9940,TO TRAPANI.,
9941,TO TRAPANI.,"Thirdly, Piacus, to which town the coin had been ascribed by the"
9942,TO TRAPANI.,"dealer from whom the Museum bought it, is mentioned very briefly by"
9943,TO TRAPANI.,"Stephanus Byzantinus, but by no other writer, as a Sicilian city, and"
9944,TO TRAPANI.,he expressly states that its citizens were called ΠΙΑΚΗΝΟΙ; so that the
9945,TO TRAPANI.,"coin, if it was one of theirs, should bear the legend ΓΙΑΚΗΝ instead of"
9946,TO TRAPANI.,the alleged ΓIAKIN. Stephanus Byzantinus did not write till about 500
9947,TO TRAPANI.,"A.D., and in the absence of any statement from him to the effect that"
9948,TO TRAPANI.,"Piacus was an old city, it argues some recklessness to conclude that it"
9949,TO TRAPANI.,had existed for at least a thousand years when he mentioned it; there
9950,TO TRAPANI.,"is no evidence from any quarter to support such a conclusion, and a"
9951,TO TRAPANI.,"safer one will be that the dealer above referred to, not knowing where"
9952,TO TRAPANI.,"the coin came from, and looking for a city in Stephanus Byzantinus,"
9953,TO TRAPANI.,found he could get nothing nearer than Piacus--whereon he saw a Γ as
9954,TO TRAPANI.,"the smallest thing he could do in Πs, into his coin, and sold it to the"
9955,TO TRAPANI.,British Museum probably for a song as compared with the value which it
9956,TO TRAPANI.,now proves to have. Thus the Museum authorities having got it into part
9957,TO TRAPANI.,of their notes (for they seem to have got IAKIN into another part) that
9958,TO TRAPANI.,"the legend was ΓΙΑΚΗΝ, have very naturally been led to see more on the"
9959,TO TRAPANI.,coin than those who have no notes will quite bear them out in seeing.
9960,TO TRAPANI.,But I will add no more. The legend is obviously IAKIN.
9961,TO TRAPANI.,
9962,TO TRAPANI.,"This is an abbreviation for ΙΑΚΙΝΩΝ, as ΕΡΥΚΙΝ and ΚΕΝΤΟΡΙΠΙΝ are for"
9963,TO TRAPANI.,"ΕΡΥΚΙΝΩΝ and ΚΕΝΤΟΡΙΠΙΝΩ, not to quote further examples. It means that"
9964,TO TRAPANI.,"the people who struck it were called ΙΑΚΙΝΕΣ, and though we cannot"
9965,TO TRAPANI.,determine the precise name of their city we may infer with confidence
9966,TO TRAPANI.,"that it was some derivative of ΙΑΚΟΣ, which is given in Liddell and"
9967,TO TRAPANI.,Scott as meaning Ionian. The name may very likely have been ΙΑΞ though
9968,TO TRAPANI.,I cannot find any authority for the existence of such a town.
9969,TO TRAPANI.,
9970,TO TRAPANI.,"I hold, therefore, that as late as B.C. 430 there was near Trapani"
9971,TO TRAPANI.,"a town still more or less autonomous, which claimed Ionian descent"
9972,TO TRAPANI.,and which also claimed to be in some special way connected with the
9973,TO TRAPANI.,_Odyssey_; for I am assured that nothing would be allowed on a coin
9974,TO TRAPANI.,except what had an important bearing on the anterior history of those
9975,TO TRAPANI.,who struck it. Admitting that the reverse of the coin in question
9976,TO TRAPANI.,must be taken as a reproduction of Ulysses' brooch--and I found no
9977,TO TRAPANI.,difference of opinion among the numismatists at the Museum on this
9978,TO TRAPANI.,"head--it is hard to see what more apposite means of saying ""Odyssey"""
9979,TO TRAPANI.,upon a coin can be suggested than to stamp it with the subject which
9980,TO TRAPANI.,invites numismatic treatment more than any other in the whole poem.
9981,TO TRAPANI.,"It seems to me, then, that though the theory that there was an Ionian"
9982,TO TRAPANI.,city in the neighbourhood of Eryx which could claim connection with the
9983,TO TRAPANI.,"_Odyssey_ will stand perfectly well without the coin, the coin cannot"
9984,TO TRAPANI.,stand without involving the existence of an Ionian city near Eryx which
9985,TO TRAPANI.,"claimed connection with the _Odyssey_. Happily, though the coin is"
9986,TO TRAPANI.,"unique, there is no question as to its genuineness."
9987,TO TRAPANI.,
9988,TO TRAPANI.,"To those, therefore, who ask me for monuments, ruins of buildings,"
9989,TO TRAPANI.,historical documents to support a Sicano-Ionian civilisation near Eryx
9990,TO TRAPANI.,"in times heretofore prehistoric, I reply that as late as 430 B.C. all"
9991,TO TRAPANI.,these things appear to have existed. Letting alone the testimony of
9992,TO TRAPANI.,"Thucydides, surely an Ionian coin is no small historical document in"
9993,TO TRAPANI.,support of an Ionian city. A coin will say more in fewer words and
9994,TO TRAPANI.,more authoritatively than anything else will. The coin in question
9995,TO TRAPANI.,cannot belong to an Ionian colony on Mt. Eryx or thereabouts recently
9996,TO TRAPANI.,established in 430 B.C. We should have heard of such a colony; how
9997,TO TRAPANI.,inconceivable again is the bringing in of the _Odyssey_ on this
9998,TO TRAPANI.,supposition. If the city existed at all it can only have done so as a
9999,TO TRAPANI.,survival of the Phocæan settlement of which Thucydides tells us.
10000,TO TRAPANI.,
10001,TO TRAPANI.,I want no evidence for the survival of such a settlement in later
10002,TO TRAPANI.,times; it is not incumbent upon me to show whether it survived or no;
10003,TO TRAPANI.,"the abundant, I might almost say super-abundant, coincidences between"
10004,TO TRAPANI.,"all both Scherian and Ithacan scenes in the _Odyssey_, and Trapani with"
10005,TO TRAPANI.,"its immediate neighbourhood, is enough to demonstrate the Trapanese"
10006,TO TRAPANI.,origin of the poem. Its pre-Syracusan and pre-Sicelian indications
10007,TO TRAPANI.,"fix it as not later than about 1050 B.C., its dialect, Ionic-Æolian,"
10008,TO TRAPANI.,connects it with the Phocæans above referred to. It does not concern
10009,TO TRAPANI.,me to show what became of these Phocæans after the _Odyssey_ had been
10010,TO TRAPANI.,written; what I have said about the coin IAKIN is said more in the
10011,TO TRAPANI.,"interests of the coin than of the _Odyssey_, which is a more potent"
10012,TO TRAPANI.,and irrefragable proof of its own _provenance_ and date than any coin
10013,TO TRAPANI.,"struck some 600 years later can conceivably be. Still, the coin being"
10014,TO TRAPANI.,"there, I use it to answer those who demand some evidence external"
10015,TO TRAPANI.,"to the _Odyssey_ itself. When they ask me where are my monuments,"
10016,TO TRAPANI.,"I answer that they are within the coin, circumscribed by the small"
10017,TO TRAPANI.,cincture of an inch and a half at most. For a coin is a city in little;
10018,TO TRAPANI.,"he who looks on one beholds a people, an evidence of title, a whole"
10019,TO TRAPANI.,"civilisation with its buildings of every kind. Destroy these, but so"
10020,TO TRAPANI.,"long as a single one of its coins remains, the city though dead is"
10021,TO TRAPANI.,"yet alive, and the fact of its having had buildings that could become"
10022,TO TRAPANI.,ruinous is as palpable as though the ruins themselves had come down to
10023,TO TRAPANI.,us.
10024,TO TRAPANI.,
10025,TO TRAPANI.,"The exact situation of this city Iax, Iacus, or Iace, cannot be"
10026,TO TRAPANI.,"determined, but I incline to place it about a mile or a mile and a"
10027,TO TRAPANI.,half East of Trapani at or near a place called Argenteria. This place
10028,TO TRAPANI.,"is said to have yielded silver, but no one believes that it ever did"
10029,TO TRAPANI.,"so. It is a quarry and by no means a large one, just at the beginning"
10030,TO TRAPANI.,of the rise to Mt. Eryx. Some say that Argenteria is a corruption of
10031,TO TRAPANI.,"Cetaria and refers to a monster fish that was killed here, though"
10032,TO TRAPANI.,how it got so far from the sea is not apparent; I think it much more
10033,TO TRAPANI.,"likely, however, that it is a corruption of Iacinteria and that Iax,"
10034,TO TRAPANI.,"or Iace, was a quasi-autonomous suburb of Drepanum to which the Greek"
10035,TO TRAPANI.,inhabitants were permitted to retire when the Carthaginians took
10036,TO TRAPANI.,possession of the parts of the town bordering on the harbour.
10037,TO TRAPANI.,
10038,TO TRAPANI.,"My friend Signor Sugameli of Trapani, whose zeal in this matter so far"
10039,TO TRAPANI.,"outstrips even my own, that I would gladly moderate it if I knew how to"
10040,TO TRAPANI.,"do so, assures me that in his younger days he used to employ a stone in"
10041,TO TRAPANI.,building that the mason told him came from a quarry at the foot of Mt.
10042,TO TRAPANI.,Eryx called Dacinoi or D'Acinoi. This was years before any one thought
10043,TO TRAPANI.,of bringing Ionians to Trapani. Signor Sugameli suggested that possibly
10044,TO TRAPANI.,the name might be a corruption of D'Alcinoo--but we may be sure that
10045,TO TRAPANI.,whatever else Alcinous's name may have been it was not Alcinous. I
10046,TO TRAPANI.,"asked Signor Sugameli to produce the mason, but he could neither find"
10047,TO TRAPANI.,him nor hear of the quarry Dacinoi. Nevertheless I feel sure that he
10048,TO TRAPANI.,"was told what he said he was, and as the quarry cannot have been far"
10049,TO TRAPANI.,"from the Argenteria, I think it probable that its name was a corruption"
10050,TO TRAPANI.,of _degli Iacinoi_.
10051,TO TRAPANI.,
10052,TO TRAPANI.,"Whether this is sound or not, I do not doubt that the Iacenses who"
10053,TO TRAPANI.,figure so largely in Sicilian history during the Eleventh Century
10054,TO TRAPANI.,of our own era are to be connected with the Ionian settlement that
10055,TO TRAPANI.,produced the _Odyssey_. The Iacenses were then settled chiefly about
10056,TO TRAPANI.,"forty miles East of Trapani, but the interval of some 1400 years and"
10057,TO TRAPANI.,more between the date of the coin Iakin and the conquest of Sicily
10058,TO TRAPANI.,by the Normans will leave plenty of time for them to have spread or
10059,TO TRAPANI.,migrated.

10214,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10215,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,Professor Jebb is disposed to attribute _Il_. XXIV. to the writer of
10216,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"_Il_. IX., which he does not ascribe to Homer, and would date _circ_."
10217,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,B.C. 750-600. I regret that I can go no further with him than that
10218,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,_Il_. XXIV. and _Il_. IX. are by the same hand.
10219,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10220,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,It is beyond my scope to point out the slight and perfectly unimportant
10221,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,variations from the _Iliad_ which are found in some of the Odyssean
10222,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,lines to which I have given a reference; they are with hardly an
10223,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,exception such as are occasioned by difference of context. Though
10224,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"unimportant they are not uninteresting, but I must leave them for the"
10225,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,reader to examine if he feels inclined to do so.
10226,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10227,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,He will observe that some lines are nearly and some quite common to
10228,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"the two extracts above given, and I should add that not a few other"
10229,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"lines are repeated elsewhere in the _Iliad_, but enough remains that"
10230,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,is peculiar to either of the two extracts to convince me that the
10231,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"writer of the _Odyssey_ knew them both. And not only this, but they"
10232,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"seem to have risen in her mind as spontaneously, and often no doubt as"
10233,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"unconsciously, as passages from the Bible, Prayer-book, and Shakspeare"
10234,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,do to ourselves.
10235,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10236,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"If, then, we find the writer so familiar with two such considerable"
10237,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,extracts from the first and last Books of the _Iliad_--for I believe
10238,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"the reader will feel no more doubt than I do, that she knew them, and"
10239,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,was borrowing from them--can we avoid thinking it probable that she
10240,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"was acquainted, to say the least of it, with the intermediate Books?"
10241,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,Such surely should be the most natural and least strained conclusion to
10242,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"arrive at, but I will proceed to shew that she knew the intermediate"
10243,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,Books exceedingly well.
10244,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10245,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,I pass over the way in which Mentor's name is coined from Nestor's
10246,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"(_cf_. _Il_. II. 76-77 and _Od_. ii. 224, 225, and 228), and will go"
10247,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,on to the striking case of Ulysses' servant Eurybates. In _Od_. xix.
10248,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"218, 219 Penelope has asked Ulysses (who is disguised so that she does"
10249,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,not recognise him) for details as to the followers Ulysses had with
10250,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"him on his way to Troy, and Ulysses answers that he had a servant"
10251,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,named Eurybates who was hunched in the shoulders (xix. 247). Turning
10252,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,to _Il_. II. 184 we find that Ulysses had a servant from Ithaca named
10253,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"Eurybates, but he does not seem to have been hunched in the shoulders;"
10254,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"on reading further, however, we immediately come to Thersites, ""whose"
10255,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"shoulders were hunched over his chest"" (_Il_. II. 217, 218). Am I too"
10256,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"hasty in concluding that the writer of the _Odyssey_, wanting an"
10257,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"additional detail for Penelope's greater assurance, and not finding one"
10258,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"in the _Iliad_, took the hunchiness off the back of the next man to"
10259,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,him and set it on to the back of Eurybates? I do not say that no other
10260,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"hypothesis can be framed in order to support a different conclusion,"
10261,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,but I think the one given above will best commend itself to common
10262,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,sense; and the most natural inference from it is that the writer of the
10263,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,_Odyssey_ knew at any rate part of _Il_. II. much as we have it now.
10264,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10265,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,I often wondered why Menelaus should have been made to return on the
10266,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,self-same day as that on which Orestes was holding the funeral feast
10267,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,of Ægisthus and Clytemnestra; the Greek which tells us that he did so
10268,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,runs:--
10269,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10270,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,αὐτῆμαρ δέ οἱ ἦλθε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος (_Od_. iii. 311).
10271,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10272,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,I did not find the explanation till I remembered that in _Iliad_ II.
10273,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"408, when Agamemnon has been inviting the Achæan chieftains to a"
10274,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"banquet, he did not ask Menelaus, for Menelaus came of his own accord:--"
10275,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10276,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"αὐτόματος δέ οἱ ἦλθε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος,"
10277,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10278,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,on remembering this I observed that it would be less trouble to make
10279,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,Menelaus come home on the very day of Ægisthus' funeral feast than to
10280,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,alter αὐτόματος in any other way which would leave the rest of the
10281,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,line available. I should be ashamed of the writer of the _Odyssey_ for
10282,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"having done this, unless I believed it to be merely due to unconscious"
10283,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,cerebration. That the Odyssean and Iliadic lines are taken the one
10284,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,from the other will approve itself to the instincts of any one who
10285,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"is accustomed to deal with literary questions at all, and it is not"
10286,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"conceivable that Menelaus should, in the _Iliad_, have been made to"
10287,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,come uninvited because in the _Odyssey_ he happened to come back on the
10288,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,very day when Orestes was holding Ægisthus' funeral feast; the Iliadic
10289,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,context explains why Menelaus came uninvited--it was because he knew
10290,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"that Agamemnon was too busy to invite him. I infer, therefore, that the"
10291,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,writer of the _Odyssey_ again shows herself familiar with a part of
10292,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,_Il_. II.
10293,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10294,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,I can see no sufficient reason for even questioning that the catalogues
10295,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,of the Achæan and Trojan forces in the second Book of the _Iliad_
10296,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,were part of the _Iliad_ as it left Homer's hands. They are wanted
10297,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,so as to explain who the people are of whom we are to hear in the
10298,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"body of the poem; their position, is perfectly natural; the Achæan"
10299,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,catalogue is prepared in Nestor's speech (II. 360-368); Homer almost
10300,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"tells us that he has had assistance in compiling it, for he invokes"
10301,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"the Muse, as he does more than once in later Books, and declares that"
10302,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"he knows nothing of his own knowledge, but depends entirely upon what"
10303,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,has been told him[1]; the lines quoted or alluded to in the _Odyssey_
10304,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,are far too marked to allow of our doubting that the writer knew
10305,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"both catalogues familiarly; I cannot within my limits give them, but"
10306,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"would call the reader's attention to _Il_. II. 488, _cf_. _Od_. iv."
10307,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,240; to the considering Sparta and Lacedæmon as two places (_Il_. II.
10308,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"580, 581) which the writer of the _Odyssey_ does (iv. 10), though"
10309,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,she has abundantly shown that she knew them to be but one; to _Il_.

10331,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,None of the passages above quoted or referred to are to be found
10332,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"anywhere else in the _Iliad_, so that if from the _Iliad_ at all, they"
10333,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"are from the catalogues. But having already shown, as I believe, that"
10334,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"the writer of the _Odyssey_ knew lines 76, 77, 78, 184, 216, 217,"
10335,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"and 408 of Book II., and accepting the rest of the Book as written"
10336,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"by Homer, with or without assistance, I shall not argue further in"
10337,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"support of my contention that the whole of Book II. was known to, and"
10338,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"occasionally borrowed from, by the writer of the _Odyssey_."
10339,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10340,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,Perhaps the prettiest example of unconscious cerebration in the
10341,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"_Odyssey_ is to be found in the opening line of _Od_. iii, which runs"
10342,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"ἠέλιος δ' ἀνόρουσε λιπὼν περικαλλέα λίμνην, which is taken from _Il_."
10343,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"v. 20, Ιδαῖος δ' ἀνόρουσε λιπὼν περικαλλέα δίφρον· One is at a loss to"
10344,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,conceive how a writer so apparently facile should drift thus on to an
10345,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,Iliadic line of such different signification except as the result of
10346,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,saturation. It is inconceivable that she should have cast about for a
10347,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"line to say that the sun was rising, and thought that Idæus jumping off"
10348,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,his chariot would do. She again has this line in her mind when in Book
10349,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,xxii. 95 she writes Τηλέμαχος δ' ἀπόρουσε λιπὼν δολιχόσκιον ἔγχος.
10350,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10351,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,The same kind of unconscious celebration evidenced by the lines last
10352,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,referred to leads her sometimes to repeat lines of her own in a strange
10353,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"way, without probably being at all aware of it. As for example:--"
10354,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10355,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,βασιλῆες.....εἰσὶ καὶ ἄλλοι
10356,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"πολλοὶ ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ νέοι ἠδὲ παλαιοί,"
10357,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"(i. 394, 395)."
10358,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10359,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,This passage in the following Book becomes:--
10360,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10361,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,εἰσὶ δὲ νῆες
10362,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,πολλαὶ ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ νέαι ἠδὲ παλαιαί·
10363,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"(ii. 292, 293)."
10364,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10365,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,Another similar case is that of the famous line about Sisyphus' stone
10366,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"bounding down hill in a string of dactyls, _Od_. xi. 598, it runs:--"
10367,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10368,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,αὖτις ἔπειτα πέδονδε κυλίνδετο λᾶας ἀναιδής.
10369,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10370,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"""The cruel stone came bounding down again on to the plain."" I believe"
10371,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,this to be nothing but an unconscious adaptation from the one dactylic
10372,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"line that I can remember in the _Iliad_, I mean:--"
10373,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10374,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,ἀμφοτέρω δὲ τένοντε καὶ ἴστέα λᾶας ἀναιδὴς
10375,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,ἄχρις ἀπηλοίησεν.
10376,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"_Il_. IV 521, 522."
10377,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10378,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10379,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"""The cruel stone shattered the bones of the neck, tendons and all."""
10380,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,Granted (which is very doubtful) that there may be an accommodation of
10381,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"sound to sense in the Odyssean line, I contend that the suggestion came"
10382,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,from the Iliadic line.
10383,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,
10384,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,I would gladly go through the whole _Iliad_ calling attention to the
10385,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"use the writer of the _Odyssey_ has made of it, but to do this would"
10386,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,require hardly less than a book to itself. I will therefore ask the
10387,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,reader to accept my statement that no one Book in the _Iliad_ shows
10388,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,any marked difference from the others as regards the use that has
10389,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"been made of it, and will limit myself to those Books that have been"
10390,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,most generally declared to be later additions--I mean Book X. and
10391,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,Book XVIII.--for I consider that I have already sufficiently shown
10392,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"the writer of the _Odyssey_ to have known Books I., XXIV., and the"
10393,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"Catalogues in Book II. It may be well, however, to include Book XI."
10394,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"in my examination, for this is one of the most undoubted, and it will"
10395,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,be interesting to note that the writer of the _Odyssey_ has both the
10396,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,most doubted and undoubted Books equally at her fingers' ends. I shall
10397,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,only call attention to passages that do not occur more than once in the
10398,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,"_Iliad_, and will omit the very numerous ones that may be considered as"
10399,THE SAME AS WHAT WE NOW HAVE.,common form.

10472,XV. 45.,"Book X., it may be alleged that the writer of the _Odyssey_ took them."
10473,XV. 45.,This makes the writer of the _Odyssey_ to have taken about one line

10475,XV. 45.,"Wolf--no two of whom, however, are of the same opinion, so it is hard"

10484,XV. 45.,"contend that the passages above given were taken from the _Odyssey_,"
10485,XV. 45.,but this contention should not be urged in respect of Book X. more than
10486,XV. 45.,"in respect of the other Books, which are all of them equally replete"

10488,XV. 45.,"above of _Il_. X. 243, 244 and _Od_. i. 65, 66, it is not easy to doubt"

10494,XV. 45.,
10495,XV. 45.,The first two lines of Book XI. are identical with the first two of

10540,XV. 45.,"Here we have only eleven well-marked passages common to both poems, in"
10541,XV. 45.,spite of the fact that Book XI. is nearly 300 lines longer than Book
10542,XV. 45.,"X., but I am precluded from referring to any passages that occur also"
10543,XV. 45.,in any other Book of the _Iliad_. Running my eye over the underlined

10545,XV. 45.,"that there is some, difference between their frequency in Book XI.,"
10546,XV. 45.,and in the other Books. Furthermore I own to finding Book XI. perhaps
10547,XV. 45.,the least interesting and the most perfunctorily written in all the
10548,XV. 45.,"_Iliad_, and can well believe that the writer of the _Odyssey_ borrowed"
10549,XV. 45.,"from it less because she was of the same opinion, but however this may"
10550,XV. 45.,"be, the number of common passages above collected is ample to establish"
10551,XV. 45.,the fact that the writer of the _Odyssey_ had Book XI. in her mind as
10552,XV. 45.,well as Book X.
10553,XV. 45.,
10554,XV. 45.,I will now go on to examine the passages in _Il_. XVIII. which the
10555,XV. 45.,writer of the _Odyssey_ has wholly or in part adopted. They are:--
10556,XV. 45.,
10557,XV. 45.,"_Il_. XVIII. 22-24, ὦς φάτο τὸν δ' ἄχεος νεφέλη ἐκάλυψε μέλαινα"

10559,XV. 45.,χεύατο κὰκ κεφαλῆς χαρίεν δ' ᾔσχυνε πρόσωπον.
10560,XV. 45.,
10561,XV. 45.,These lines are found _Od_. xxiv. 315-317 except that as they refer to
10562,XV. 45.,"an old man, instead of, as in the _Iliad_, to a young one, χαρίεν δ'"
10563,XV. 45.,ᾔσχυνε πρόσωπον has become πολιῆς ἀδινὰ στεναχίζων. The first of the
10564,XV. 45.,three lines occurs also in _Il_. XVII. 591.
10565,XV. 45.,
10566,XV. 45.,"_Il_. XVIII. 108, καὶ χόλος ὅς τ' ἐφέηκε πολύφρονά περ χαλεπῆναι, _cf_."

10582,XV. 45.,
10583,XV. 45.,"_Il_. XVIII. 345 is omitted. In the following line οί becomes αί, and"
10584,XV. 45.,in the one after this ἑλόντες becomes ἑλοῦσαι·

10660,(XVIII. 107-110):--,(XVIII. 107-110):--
10661,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10662,(XVIII. 107-110):--,ὦς ἔρις ἔκ τε θεῶν ἔκ τ' ἀνθρώπων άπόλοιτο
10663,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"καὶ χόλος ὅς τ' ἐφέηκε πολύφρονά περ χαλεπῆναι,"

10665,(XVIII. 107-110):--,ἀνδρῶν ἐν στήθεσσιν ἀέξεται ἠύτε καπνός.
10666,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10667,(XVIII. 107-110):--,The context of the Odyssean line which I suppose to be derived from
10668,(XVIII. 107-110):--,this noble passage is as follows (xiv. 462-465):--
10669,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10670,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"κέκλυθι νῦν Ἐύμαιε, καὶ ἄλλοι πάντες εταῖροι·"
10671,(XVIII. 107-110):--,εὐξάμενός τι ἔπος ἐρέω· οἶνος γὰρ ἀνώγει
10672,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"ἠλεός, ὅς τ' ἐφέηκε πολύφρονά περ μάλ' ἀεῖσαι"
10673,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"καὶ θ' ἁπαλόν γελάσαι, καί τ' ὀρχήσαθαι ἀνῆκεν,"
10674,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10675,(XVIII. 107-110):--,Which is the most likely--that the magnificent Iliadic lines were
10676,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"developed from _Od_. xiv. 464, or that this line is an unconscious"
10677,(XVIII. 107-110):--,adaptation from _Il_. XVIII. 108? For that the two lines are father and
10678,(XVIII. 107-110):--,son will hardly be disputed.
10679,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10680,(XVIII. 107-110):--,Which again commends itself best--that the writer of _Il_. XVIII. took
10681,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"the heating of Ulysses' bath water to heat water for Patroclus, or that"
10682,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"the writer of the _Odyssey_ omitted the line about Patroclus, and used"
10683,(XVIII. 107-110):--,the rest of the passage to heat water for Ulysses' bath?
10684,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10685,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"As regards the two salutations to Thetis (_Il_. XVIII. 385-387, and"
10686,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"424-427), is it more likely that the writer of _Il_. XVIII. made two"
10687,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"bites of the Odyssean cherry of v. 87-91, or that the writer of the"
10688,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"_Odyssey_, wanting but a single salutation, combined the two Iliadic"
10689,(XVIII. 107-110):--,ones as in the passage above given?
10690,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10691,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"Lastly, is the list of constellations which Vulcan put on to the shield"
10692,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"of Achilles more likely to have been amplified from _Od_. v. 272-275,"
10693,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"or these last-named lines to have been taken, with such modification as"
10694,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"was necessary, from _Il_. XVIII. 486-489? Whatever may be the date of"
10695,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"the _Odyssey_, I cannot doubt that _Il_. XVIII. must be dated earlier;"
10696,(XVIII. 107-110):--,and yet there is no Book of the _Iliad_ about which our eminent
10697,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"Homeric scholars are more full of small complaints, or more unanimous"
10698,(XVIII. 107-110):--,in regarding as an interpolation. If there is one part of the _Iliad_
10699,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"rather than another in which Homer shows himself unapproachable, it is"
10700,(XVIII. 107-110):--,in his description of the shield of Achilles.
10701,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10702,(XVIII. 107-110):--,I will again assure the reader that all the Books of the _Iliad_ seem
10703,(XVIII. 107-110):--,drawn from with the same freedom as that shown in those which I have
10704,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"now dealt with in detail, and also that I can find no part of the"
10705,(XVIII. 107-110):--,_Odyssey_ which borrows any less freely from the _Iliad_ than the rest
10706,(XVIII. 107-110):--,of the poem; here and there difference of subject leads the writer to
10707,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"go three or four pages without a single Iliadic cento, but this is"
10708,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"rare. One or two, or even sometimes three or four, Iliadic passages in"
10709,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"a page is nearer the average, but of these some will be what may be"
10710,(XVIII. 107-110):--,called common form.
10711,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10712,(XVIII. 107-110):--,Their frequency raises no suggestion of plagiarism any more than the
10713,(XVIII. 107-110):--,Biblical quotations in _Pilgrim's Progress_ would do if the references
10714,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"were cut out. They are so built into the context as to be structural,"
10715,(XVIII. 107-110):--,not ornamental; and to preclude the idea of their having been added by
10716,(XVIII. 107-110):--,copyists or editors. They seem to be the spontaneous outcome of the
10717,(XVIII. 107-110):--,fullness of the writer's knowledge of the _Iliad_. It is also evident
10718,(XVIII. 107-110):--,that she is not making a resumé of other people's works; she is telling
10719,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"the story _de novo_ from the point of view of herself, her home, her"
10720,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"countrymen, and the whole island of Sicily. Other peoples and places"
10721,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"may be tolerated, but they raise no enthusiasm in her mind."
10722,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10723,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"Nevertheless, a certain similarity of style and feeling between the"
10724,(XVIII. 107-110):--,_Odyssey_ and all the poems of the Epic cycle is certain to have
10725,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"existed, and indeed can be proved to have existed from the fragments"
10726,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"of the lost poems that still remain. In all art, whether literary,"
10727,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"pictorial, musical, or architectural, a certain character will be"
10728,(XVIII. 107-110):--,common to a certain age and country. Every age has its stock subjects
10729,(XVIII. 107-110):--,for artistic treatment; the reason for this is that it is convenient
10730,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"for the reader, spectator, or listener, to be familiar with the main"
10731,(XVIII. 107-110):--,outlines of the story. Written literature is freer in this respect
10732,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"than painting or sculpture, for it can explain and prepare the reader"
10733,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"better for what is coming. Literature which, though written, is"
10734,(XVIII. 107-110):--,intended mainly for recitation before an audience few of whom can
10735,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"read, exists only on condition of its appealing instantly to the"
10736,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"understanding, and will, therefore, deal only with what the hearer is"
10737,(XVIII. 107-110):--,supposed already to know in outline. The writer may take any part of
10738,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"the stock national subjects that he or she likes, and within reasonable"
10739,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"limits may treat it according to his or her fancy, but it must hitch on"
10740,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"to the old familiar story, and hence will arise a certain similarity of"
10741,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"style between all poems of the same class that belong to the same age,"
10742,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"language, and people. This holds just as good for the medieval Italian"
10743,(XVIII. 107-110):--,painters as it does for the Epic cycle. They offer us a similarity in
10744,(XVIII. 107-110):--,dissimilarity and a dissimilarity in similarity.
10745,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10746,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"When we remember, however, that the style of the _Odyssey_ must not"
10747,(XVIII. 107-110):--,only perforce gravitate towards that of all the other then existing
10748,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"epic poems, but also that the writer's mind is as strongly leavened"
10749,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"with the mind of Homer, let alone the other Cyclic poets, as we have"
10750,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"seen it to be, it is not surprising that the veneer of virility thus"
10751,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"given to a woman's work should have concealed the less patent, but far"
10752,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"more conclusive, evidence that the writer was not of the same sex as"
10753,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"the man, or men, from whom she was borrowing."
10754,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10755,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"At the same time, in spite of the use she makes of Homer, I think she"
10756,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"was angry with him, and perhaps jealous; on which head I will say more"
10757,(XVIII. 107-110):--,in my next Chapter. Possibly the way he laughs at women and teases
10758,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"them, not because he dislikes them, but because he enjoys playing with"
10759,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"them, irritates her; she was not disposed to play on such a serious"
10760,(XVIII. 107-110):--,subject. We have seen how she retorts on him for having made a tripod
10761,(XVIII. 107-110):--,worth three times as much as a good serviceable woman of all work.
10762,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"His utter contempt, again, for the gods, which he is at no pains to"
10763,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"conceal, would be offensive to a writer who never permits herself to"
10764,(XVIII. 107-110):--,go beyond the occasional mild irreverence of the Vicar's daughter.
10765,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"Therefore, she treats Homer, as its seems to me, not without a certain"
10766,(XVIII. 107-110):--,hardness; and this is the only serious fault I have to find with her.
10767,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10768,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"For example, she takes the concluding lines of Hector's farewell to"
10769,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"Andromache, a passage which one would have thought she would have"
10770,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"shrunk from turning to common uses, and puts it into the mouth of"
10771,(XVIII. 107-110):--,Telemachus when he is simply telling his mother to take herself off.
10772,(XVIII. 107-110):--,She does this in i. 356-359 and again in xxi. 350-353. This is not as
10773,(XVIII. 107-110):--,it should be. Nor yet again is her taking the water that was heated
10774,(XVIII. 107-110):--,to wash the blood from the body of poor Patroclus (_Il_. XVIII. 344
10775,(XVIII. 107-110):--,&c.) and using it for Ulysses' bath (_Od_. viii. 434-437). Surely the
10776,(XVIII. 107-110):--,disrespect here is deeper than any that can be found in Homer towards
10777,(XVIII. 107-110):--,the gods.
10778,(XVIII. 107-110):--,
10779,(XVIII. 107-110):--,"But, whatever the spirit may have been in which the writer of the"

10831,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"_Little Iliad_, a poem which was apparently of no great length, being"
10832,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,only in four Books.
10833,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10834,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,From the two Books of the _Sack of Troy_ we get the account of the
10835,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,council held by the Trojans over the wooden horse (_Od_. viii. 492-517).
10836,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10837,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,We have seen how familiar the authoress of the _Odyssey_ was with
10838,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the _Iliad_; there only remains, therefore, one of the eight Trojan"
10839,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"poems which she does not appear to have known--I mean the _Telegony_,"
10840,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"which is generally, and one would say correctly, placed later than the"
10841,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,_Odyssey_; but even though it were earlier we may be sure that the
10842,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"writer of the _Odyssey_ would have ignored it, for it will hardly bear"
10843,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,her out in the character she has given of Penelope.
10844,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10845,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"In passing I may say that though Homer (meaning, of course, the writer"
10846,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"of the _Iliad_) occasionally says things that suggest the Cypria, there"
10847,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,is not a line that even suggests knowledge of a single one of the
10848,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,incidents given by Proclus as forming the subjects of the other Books
10849,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"of the Trojan cycle; the inference, therefore, would seem to be that"
10850,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"none of them, except possibly, though very uncertainly, the Cypria, had"
10851,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,appeared before he wrote. Nevertheless we cannot be sure that this was
10852,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,so.
10853,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10854,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,The curious question now arises why the writer of the _Odyssey_ should
10855,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"have avoided referring to a single Iliadic incident, while showing no"
10856,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,unwillingness to treat more or less fully of almost all those mentioned
10857,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"by Proclus as dealt with in the other poems of the Trojan cycle, and"
10858,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,also while laying the _Iliad_ under such frequent contributions.
10859,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10860,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,I remember saying to a great publisher that a certain book was
10861,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,obviously much indebted to a certain other book to which no reference
10862,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"was made. ""Has the writer,"" said the publisher in question, ""referred"
10863,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"to other modern books on the same subject?"" I answered, ""Certainly."""
10864,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"""Then,"" said he, ""let me tell you that it is our almost unvaried"
10865,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"experience that when a writer mentions a number of other books, and"
10866,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"omits one which he has evidently borrowed from, the omitted book is"
10867,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the one which has most largely suggested his own."" His words seemed"
10868,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,to explain my difficulty about the way in which the writer of the
10869,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,_Odyssey_ lets the incidents of the _Iliad_ so severely alone. It was
10870,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the poem she was trying to rival, if not to supersede. She knew it to"
10871,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,be far the finest of the Trojan cycle; she was so familiar with it
10872,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,that appropriate lines from it were continually suggesting themselves
10873,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,to her--and what is an appropriate line good for if it is not to be
10874,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"appropriated? She knew she could hold her own against the other poems,"
10875,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"but she did not feel so sure about the _Iliad_, and she would not cover"
10876,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,any of the ground which it had already occupied.
10877,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10878,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Of course there is always this other explanation possible, I mean that"
10879,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,traditions about Homer's private life may have been known to the writer
10880,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"of the _Odyssey_, which displeased her. He may have beaten his wife,"
10881,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"or run away with somebody else's, or both, or done a hundred things"
10882,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,which made him not exactly the kind of person whom Arete would like her
10883,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"daughter to countenance more than was absolutely necessary. I believe,"
10884,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"however, that the explanation given in the preceding paragraph is the"
10885,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,most reasonable.
10886,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10887,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,And now let me explain what I consider to have been the development
10888,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,of the _Odyssey_ in the hands of the poetess. I cannot think that
10889,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,she deliberately set herself to write an epic poem of great length.
10890,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,The work appears to have grown on her hands piecemeal from small
10891,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"beginnings, each additional effort opening the door for further"
10892,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"development, till at last there the _Odyssey_ was--a spontaneous growth"
10893,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"rather than a thing done by observation. Had it come by observation,"
10894,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"no doubt it would have been freer from the anomalies, inconsistencies,"
10895,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"absurdities, and small slovenlinesses which are inseparable from the"
10896,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"development of any long work, the plan of which has not been fully"
10897,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,thought out beforehand. But surely in losing these it would have lost
10898,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,not a little of its charm.
10899,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10900,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"From Professor Jebb's _Introduction to Homer_, Ed. 1888, p. 131, I see"
10901,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,that he agrees with Kirchhoff in holding that the _Odyssey_ contains
10902,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"""distinct strata of poetical material from different sources and"
10903,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"periods,"" and also that the poem owes its present unity of form to one"
10904,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,man; he continues:--
10905,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10906,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,But under this unity of form there are perceptible traces
10907,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,of a process by which different compositions were adapted
10908,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,to one another.
10909,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10910,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,In a note on the preceding page he tells us that Kirchhoff regards
10911,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,the first 87 verses of Book i. as having formed the exordium of the
10912,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,original Return of Ulysses.
10913,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10914,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"My own conclusions, arrived at to the best of my belief before I had"
10915,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"read a word of Professor Jebb's _Introduction_, agree in great part"
10916,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,with the foregoing. I found the _Odyssey_ to consist of two distinct
10917,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"poems, with widely different aims, and united into a single work, not"
10918,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"unskilfully, but still not so skilfully as to conceal a change of"
10919,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"scheme. The two poems are: 1. The visit of Ulysses to the Phæacians,"
10920,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,with the story of his adventures as related by himself. 2. The story
10921,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"of Penelope and the suitors, with the episode of Telemachus's voyage"
10922,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"to Pylos. Of these two, the first was written before the writer had"
10923,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"any intention of dealing with the second, while the second in the end"
10924,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,became more important than the first.
10925,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10926,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,I cordially agree with Kirchhoff that the present exordium belongs to
10927,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the earlier poem, but I would break it off at line 79, and not at 87."
10928,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"It is a perfect introduction to the Return of Ulysses, but it is no fit"
10929,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,opening for the _Odyssey_ as it stands. I had better perhaps give it
10930,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,more fully than I have done in my abridgement. It runs:--
10931,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10932,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Tell me, oh Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far"
10933,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,and wide after he had sacked the strong citadel of Troy. He
10934,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,saw many cities and learned the manners of many nations;
10935,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"moreover, he suffered much by sea while trying to save his"
10936,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he
10937,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"might he could not save his men, for they perished through"
10938,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god
10939,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever getting home.
10940,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Tell me too about all these things, oh daughter of Jove,"
10941,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,from whatever source you may know them (i. 1-10).
10942,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10943,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Then follows the statement that Ulysses was with the nymph Calypso,"
10944,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"unable to escape, and that his enemy, Neptune, had gone to the"
10945,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Ethiopians (i. 11-21). The gods meet in council and Jove makes a speech
10946,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,about the revenge taken by Orestes on Ægisthus (i. 26-43); Minerva
10947,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"checks him, turns the subjects on to Ulysses, and upbraids Jove with"
10948,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"neglecting him (i. 44-62). Jove answers that he had not forgotten him,"
10949,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,and continues:--
10950,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10951,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"""Bear in mind that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses"
10952,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"for having blinded an eye of Polyphemus, king of the"
10953,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to Neptune by the nymph Thoösa,"
10954,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"daughter to the sea-king Phoreys, but instead of killing"
10955,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,him outright he torments him by preventing him from getting
10956,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"home. Still, let us lay our heads together and see how we"
10957,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"can help him to return. Neptune will then be pacified, for"
10958,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,if we are all of a mind he can hardly hold out against us
10959,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"unsupported"" (i. 68-79)."
10960,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10961,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Let us now omit the rest of Book i., Books ii. iii. and iv. and go on"
10962,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"with line 28 of Book v., which follows after a very similar council to"
10963,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,the one that now stands at the beginning of Book i. Continuing with
10964,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,line 28 of Book v. we read:--
10965,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10966,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,When he had thus spoken he said to his son Mercury:
10967,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"""Mercury, you are our messenger, go therefore and tell"
10968,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Calypso we have decreed that poor Ulysses is to return
10969,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"home. He is to be conveyed neither by gods nor men, but"
10970,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to
10971,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"reach fertile Scheria, &c."" (v. 28-34)."
10972,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10973,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"From this point the poem continues with only one certain, and another"
10974,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"doubtful, reference to the suitors and Penelope, until (according to"
10975,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Kirchhoff) line 184 of Book xiii. I had thought that the point of
10976,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"juncture between the two poems was in the middle of line 187, and that"
10977,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,the ἔγρετο in the second half of the line had perhaps been originally
10978,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"εὖδεν; but it must be somewhere close about this line, and I am quite"
10979,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,ready to adopt Kirchhoff's opinion now that I have come to see why
10980,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Ulysses was made to sleep so profoundly on leaving Scheria.
10981,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10982,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Till I had got hold of the explanation given on page 173, I naturally"
10983,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,thought that the strange sleep of Ulysses had been intended to lead up
10984,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"to something that was to happen in Ithaca, and which had been cancelled"
10985,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,when the scheme was enlarged and altered; for without this explanation
10986,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,it is pointless as the poem now stands.
10987,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10988,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,I do not now think that there was ever any account of what happened to
10989,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Ulysses on his waking up in Ithaca, other than what we now have, but"
10990,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,rather that the writer was led to adopt a new scheme at the very point
10991,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,where it became incumbent upon her to complete an old one. For at this
10992,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,point she would first find herself face to face with the difficulty of
10993,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,knowing what to do with Ulysses in Ithaca after she had got him there.
10994,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
10995,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,She could not ignore the suitors altogether; their existence and
10996,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Penelope's profligacy were too notorious. She could not make Ulysses
10997,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,and Penelope meet happily while the suitors were still in his house;
10998,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"and even though he killed them, he could never condone Penelope's"
10999,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,conduct--not as an epic hero. The writer of the _Odyssey_ had evidently
11000,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"thought that she could find some way out of the difficulty, but when it"
11001,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,came to the point she discovered that she must either make Ulysses kill
11002,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"his wife along with the suitors, or contend that from first to last she"
11003,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"had been pure as new fallen snow. She chose the second alternative, as"
11004,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"she would be sure to do, and brazened it out with her audience as best"
11005,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"she could. At line 187, therefore, of Book xiii. or thereabouts, she"
11006,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,broke up her 'Return' camp and started on a new campaign.
11007,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11008,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"To bring the two poems together she added lines xi. 115-137, in which"
11009,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Teiresias tells Ulysses about the suitors and his further wanderings
11010,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,when he shall have killed them. I suppose Teiresias' prophecy to have
11011,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,originally ended where Circe's does when she repeats his warning about
11012,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,the cattle of the Sun-god verbatim (xii. 137-140) with the line
11013,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11014,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,ὀψὲ κακῶς νεῖαι ὸλέσας ἄπο πάντας ἑταίρους·
11015,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11016,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,The first line of the addition to Teiresias' original prophecy (xi.
11017,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"115) is also found with a slight variant in ix. 535, but it merely"
11018,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"states that Ulysses will find trouble in his house, without mentioning"
11019,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,what the trouble is to be.
11020,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11021,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"With the two exceptions above noted, there is not only nothing in"
11022,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the original poem (_i.e_., Book i. 1-79 and v. 28--xiii. 187 or"
11023,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"thereabouts) to indicate any intention of dealing with the suitors, but"
11024,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,there are omissions which make it plain that no such intention existed.
11025,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,In the poem the Muse is only asked to sing the Return of Ulysses. In
11026,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the speech of Jove at the council of the gods (i. 32-43), he is not"
11027,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"thinking about the suitors, as he would assuredly do if the writer"
11028,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"had as yet meant to introduce them. In repeated speeches of the gods,"
11029,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,and especially in Book v. which is Book i. of the original poem (see
11030,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"lines 36-42, 288, 289, and 345),[2] it seems that Ulysses' most serious"
11031,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,troubles were to end when he had reached Scheria. So again Calypso (v.
11032,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,206-208) tries to deter him from leaving her by saying that he little
11033,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"knows what he will have to go through before he gets home again, but"
11034,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,she does not enforce her argument by adding that when he had got to
11035,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Ithaca the worst was yet to come. I have already dealt with the silence
11036,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,of Ulysses' mother in Hades.
11037,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11038,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Noting, therefore, that omission is a more telling indication of scheme"
11039,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"than lines which, when a new subject is being grafted on to an old one,"
11040,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"are certain to be inserted where necessary in order to unify the work,"
11041,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,I have no hesitation in believing that Books i. 1-79 and v. 28--xiii.
11042,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"187 or thereabouts, formed as much as the authoress ever wrote of the"
11043,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,original poem; I have the less hesitation in adopting this conclusion
11044,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"because, though I believe that I came to it independently as any one"
11045,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"must do who studies the _Odyssey_ with due attention, I find myself"
11046,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,in substantial agreement with Kirchhoff in spite of much difference
11047,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"of detail, for I cannot admit that the two poems are by two or more"
11048,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,separate people.
11049,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11050,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"The introduction of lines xi. 115-137 and of line ix. 535, with a"
11051,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,writing of a new Council of the gods at the beginning of Book v. to
11052,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"take the place of the one that was removed to Book i. 1-79, were the"
11053,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,only things that were done to give even a semblance of unity to the
11054,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"old scheme and the new, and to conceal the fact that the Muse after"
11055,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,being asked to sing of one subject spends two thirds of her time in
11056,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"singing a very different one, with a climax for which no one had asked"
11057,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"her. For, roughly, the Return occupies eight Books and Penelope and the"
11058,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,suitors sixteen.
11059,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11060,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,That lines xi. 115-137 were non-existent when Book xiii. was being
11061,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,written is demonstrated by the fact of Ulysses' saying to the Phæacians
11062,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,that he hoped he should find his wife living with her friends in peace
11063,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"(xiii. 42, 43). He could not have said this if Teiresias had already"
11064,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,told him that his house would be full of enemies who were eating up his
11065,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"estate, and whom he would have to kill. He could hardly forget such a"
11066,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,prophecy after having found Teiresias quite correct about the cattle of
11067,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,the Sun-god. Indeed he tells Penelope about his visit to Hades and his
11068,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"interview with Teiresias (xxiii. 323), so it is plain he remembered it."
11069,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"It is plain, again (from xiii. 382 &c.), that Ulysses was then learning"
11070,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,from Minerva about the suitors for the first time--which could not be
11071,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,if Teiresias' prophecy had been already written.
11072,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11073,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,It is surprising; seeing what a little further modification would have
11074,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"put everything quite straight, that the writer should have been content"
11075,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,to leave passages here and there which she must have known would betray
11076,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the want of homogeneity in her work, but we should be very thankful to"
11077,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,her for not having tidied it up with greater care. We learn far more
11078,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,about her than we should do if she had made her work go more perfectly
11079,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"upon all fours, and it is herself that we value even more than her"
11080,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"poem. She evidently preferred cobbling to cancelling, and small wonder,"
11081,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"for if, as was very probably the case, the work was traced with a"
11082,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"sharply pointed style of hardened bronze, or even steel,[3] on plates"
11083,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"of lead, alteration would not be so easy as it is with us. Besides,"
11084,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"we all cobble rather than cancel if we can. It is quite possible, but"
11085,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"I need hardly say that it is not more than a mere possibility, that"
11086,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the abruptness of the interpolation in Book iv. lines 621-624, may be"
11087,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,due simply to its having been possible to introduce four lines without
11088,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"cutting the MS. about very badly, when a longer passage would have"
11089,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,necessitated a more radical interference with it.
11090,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11091,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"We look, then, for the inception of the poem in Books i. 1-79 and"
11092,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"v. 28-xiii. 187 or thereabouts, or more roughly in Books v.-xii."
11093,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"inclusive. These Books, though they contain no discrepancies among"
11094,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,themselves except the twenty lines added to the prophecy of Teiresias
11095,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"above referred to are not homogeneous in scope, though they are so"
11096,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,in style and treatment. They split themselves into two groups of
11097,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"four, _i.e_., v.-viii. and ix.-xii. The first group is written to"
11098,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,bring Ulysses to Scheria and to exhibit the Phæacians and the writer
11099,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,herself--the interest in Ulysses being subordinate; the second is
11100,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,written to describe a periplus of Sicily.
11101,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11102,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Books ix.-xii. appear to have been written before Books v.-viii. We
11103,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,may gather this from the total absence of Minerva. It is inconceivable
11104,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,that having introduced the Goddess so freely in Books v.-viii. the
11105,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,writer should allow her to drop out from the story when there was such
11106,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,abundant scope for her interference. These Books are certainly by
11107,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,the same hand as the rest of the poem. They show the same amount of
11108,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Iliadic influence; nowhere does a woman's hand appear more plainly;
11109,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"nowhere is Sicily, and more particularly Trapani, more in evidence,"
11110,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,direct or indirect. It is from the beginning of Book ix. that we get
11111,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"our conviction that the Ionian islands were drawn from the Ægadean, and"
11112,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the voyages of Ulysses, as I have already shown, begin effectively with"
11113,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Mt. Eryx and end with Trapani. We may, therefore, dismiss all idea that"
11114,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Books ix.-xii. are by another writer.
11115,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11116,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Not only is the absence of Minerva inexplicable except by supposing
11117,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,that at the time these Books were written it was no part of the
11118,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,writer's scheme to make her such a _dea ex machinâ_ as she becomes
11119,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"later, but the writer shows herself aware that the absence of the"
11120,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"goddess in Books ix.--xii. requires apology, and makes Ulysses upbraid"
11121,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,her for having neglected him from the time he left Troy till she took
11122,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,him into the city of the Phæacians (xiii. 314-323). The goddess excuses
11123,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,herself by saying she had known all the time that he would get home
11124,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"quite safely, and had kept away because she did not want to quarrel"
11125,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,with her uncle Neptune--an excuse which we also find at the end of Book
11126,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"vi., in which Book she has, nevertheless, been beautifying Ulysses and"
11127,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,making herself otherwise useful to him. I suppose Neptune did not mind
11128,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"how much his niece helped Ulysses, provided she did not let him see her."
11129,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11130,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"I know how my own books, especially the earlier ones, got cut about,"
11131,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"rearranged, altered in scheme, and cobbled to hide alteration, so that"
11132,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,I never fairly knew what my scheme was till the book was three-quarters
11133,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"done, and I credit young writers generally with a like tentativeness."
11134,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11135,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"I have now, I believe, shown sufficient cause for thinking that Books"
11136,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"ix.-xii., _i.e_., the voyage of Ulysses round Sicily, were the part of"
11137,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,the _Odyssey_ that was written first. I am further confirmed in this
11138,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,opinion by finding Ulysses fasten his box with a knot that Circe had
11139,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"taught him (viii. 448)--as though the writer knew all about Circe,"
11140,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"though the audience, of course, could not yet do so. A knowledge of"
11141,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Book ix., moreover, is shown in Book ii. 19, a passage which does not"
11142,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,appear in my abridgement. Here we learn how Antiphus had been eaten by
11143,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Polyphemus; Book ix. is also presupposed in i. 68, which tells of the"
11144,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,blinding of the Cyclops by Ulysses.
11145,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11146,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,We may also confidently say that Books v.--viii. were written before
11147,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"i.-iv. and xiii.-xxiv. (roughly), but what the vicissitudes of Books"
11148,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"v.-viii. were, and whether or no they drew upon earlier girlish"
11149,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,sketches--as without one shred of evidence in support of my opinion I
11150,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,nevertheless incline to think--these are points which it would be a
11151,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,waste of time to even attempt to determine.
11152,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11153,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"It is in Books v.-viii., and especially in the three last of these"
11154,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"books, that the writer is most in her element. Few will differ from"
11155,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Col. Mure, who says of Scheria:--"
11156,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11157,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,There can be little doubt from the distinctive peculiarities with which
11158,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the poet has invested its inhabitants, and the precision and force"
11159,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"displayed in his portrait of their character, that the episode was"
11160,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,intended as a satire on the habits of some real people with whom he was
11161,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,familiar.
11162,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11163,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"(_Language and Literature of Ancient Greece_, Vol. I., p. 404)."
11164,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11165,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Speaking on the same page of the obviously humorous spirit in which the
11166,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Phæacian episode is conceived, Col. Mure says:---"
11167,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11168,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"This episode is, perhaps, the most brilliant specimen of"
11169,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,the poet's combined talent for the delineation of character
11170,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,and for satirical humour. While there is no portion of his
11171,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,works a right understanding of which is so indispensable
11172,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"to a full estimate of his genius, there is none, perhaps,"
11173,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,which has been so little understood. Appeal may be made to
11174,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the tenor of the most esteemed commentaries, still more,"
11175,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"perhaps, to the text of the most popular translations,"
11176,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,where the gay sarcastic tone of description and dialogue
11177,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"which seasons the whole adventure, is replaced by the"
11178,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,tragic solemnity of the gravest scones of the _Iliad_.
11179,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11180,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,People find what they bring. Is it possible that eminent Homeric
11181,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,scholars have found so much seriousness in the more humorous parts of
11182,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,the _Odyssey_ because they brought it there? To the serious all things
11183,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"are serious. Coleridge, so I learn from the notes at the end of Mr."
11184,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Gollancz's _Temple Shakespeare_, saw no burlesque in the speeches of"
11185,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,the players which are introduced into _Hamlet_. He says:--
11186,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11187,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,The fancy that a burlesque was intended sinks below
11188,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"criticism; the lines, as epic narrative, are superb."
11189,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11190,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"As Mr. Gollancz has given no reference, so neither can I. Mr. Gollancz"
11191,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,continues that if Coleridge had read Act II. Scene i. of _Dido_ and
11192,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,_Æneas_--a play left unfinished by Marlowe--he would have changed his
11193,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"mind, but I do not believe he would."
11194,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11195,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,At the same time I take it that the writer was one half laughing and
11196,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the other half serious, and would sometimes have been hard put to it to"
11197,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,know whether she was more in the one vein than in the other. So those
11198,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"who know the cantata _Narcissus_, advertised at the end of this volume,"
11199,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,will admit that there are people who are fully aware that there is no
11200,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"music in this world so great as Handel's, but who will still try to"
11201,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"write music in the style of Handel, and when they have done it, hardly"
11202,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"know whether they have been more in jest or earnest, though while doing"
11203,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"it they fully believed that they were only writing, so far as in them"
11204,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"lay, the kind of music which Handel would have written for such words"
11205,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,had he lived a hundred years or so later than he did.
11206,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11207,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"We may note, without, however, being able to deduce anything from it as"
11208,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"regards the dates at which the various parts of the poem were composed,"
11209,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,that in the first four Books of the _Odyssey_ the season appears to be
11210,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,summer rather than winter. In all the other Books (of course excluding
11211,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,those in which Ulysses tells his story) the season is unquestionably
11212,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"winter, or very early spring. It is noticeable also that snow, which"
11213,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"appears so repeatedly in the _Iliad_, and of which Homer evidently"
11214,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"felt the beauty very strongly, does not appear, and is hardly even"
11215,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"mentioned, in the _Odyssey_. I should perhaps tell some readers that"
11216,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"winter is long and severe in the Troad, while on the West coast of"
11217,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Sicily snow is almost unknown, and the winter is even milder than that"
11218,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,of Algiers.
11219,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11220,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"I ought also perhaps hardly to pass over the fact that amber, which"
11221,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"is never mentioned in the _Iliad_, appears three times in the"
11222,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"_Odyssey_.[4] This may be mere accident, nevertheless Sicily was an"
11223,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"amber-producing country, and indeed still is so; a large collection"
11224,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"of Sicilian amber exists in the museum of Castrogiovanni, the ancient"
11225,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"Enna, and I have been assured on good authority, but have not verified"
11226,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"my informant's statement, that some fine specimens may be seen in the"
11227,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,South Kensington Museum. Speaking of Sicilian amber the _Encyclopedia
11228,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,Britannica_ says:--
11229,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11230,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"The most beautiful specimens are, perhaps, those which are"
11231,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,found at Catania. They often possess a beautiful play of
11232,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,purple not to be observed in the product of other places.
11233,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,
11234,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,I cannot make out whether the first four Books were written before
11235,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the last twelve or after; probably they were written first, but there"
11236,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,is something to be said also on the other side. I will not attempt
11237,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"to settle this point, and will only add that when we hear in mind how"
11238,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,both the two main divisions of the _Odyssey_--the Phæacian episode with
11239,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the Return of Ulysses, and the story of Penelope and the suitors, show"
11240,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"unmistakeable signs of having been written at one place, by woman,"
11241,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"by woman who is evidently still very young, and that not a trace of"
11242,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"difference in versification, style, or idiom can be found between"
11243,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,"the two divisions, the only conclusion we should come to is that the"
11244,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,poem was written by one and the same woman from the first page to the
11245,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,last. I think we may also conclude in the absence of all evidence to
11246,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,the contrary--for assuredly none exists that deserves the name of
11247,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,evidence--that we have the poem to all intents and purposes in the
11248,AND ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE HANDS OF THE AUTHORESS.,shape which it had assumed in the hands of the authoress.

11268,CONCLUSION.,"Before I quit my subject, I should perhaps answer a question which"
11269,CONCLUSION.,"the reader has probably long since asked himself. I mean, how it is"
11270,CONCLUSION.,conceivable that considerations so obvious as those urged in the
11271,CONCLUSION.,foregoing Chapters should have been overlooked by so many capable
11272,CONCLUSION.,"students for so many hundreds of years, if there were any truth in"
11273,CONCLUSION.,them. For they lie all of them upon the surface; they are a mere
11274,CONCLUSION.,washing in the Jordan and being clean; they require nothing but that a
11275,CONCLUSION.,"person should read the _Odyssey_ as he would any other book, noting the"
11276,CONCLUSION.,"physical characters described in the Scherian and Ithacan scenes, and"
11277,CONCLUSION.,looking for them on some West coast of the Mediterranean to the West of
11278,CONCLUSION.,Greece.
11279,CONCLUSION.,
11280,CONCLUSION.,The answer is that the considerations which I have urged have been
11281,CONCLUSION.,"overlooked because, for very obvious reasons, it never occurred to any"
11282,CONCLUSION.,"one to look for them. ""Do you suppose, then,"" more than one eminent"
11283,CONCLUSION.,"scholar has said to me directly or indirectly, ""that no one has ever"
11284,CONCLUSION.,"read the _Odyssey_ except yourself?"" I suppose nothing of the kind,"
11285,CONCLUSION.,and know that it was only possible for the truth when once lost (as it
11286,CONCLUSION.,soon would be on the establishment of the Phœnicians at Drepanum) to be
11287,CONCLUSION.,"rediscovered, when people had become convinced that the _Odyssey_ was"
11288,CONCLUSION.,not written by the writer of the _Iliad_. This idea has not yet been
11289,CONCLUSION.,"generally accepted for more than a hundred years,[1] if so long, but"
11290,CONCLUSION.,"until it was seized and held firmly, no one was likely to suspect that"
11291,CONCLUSION.,"the _Odyssey_ could have come from Sicily, much less that it could have"
11292,CONCLUSION.,"been written by a woman, for there is not one line in the _Iliad_ which"
11293,CONCLUSION.,"even hints at the existence of Sicily, or makes the reader suspect the"
11294,CONCLUSION.,"author to have been a woman, while there are any number of passages"
11295,CONCLUSION.,which seem absolutely prohibitive of any other opinion than that the
11296,CONCLUSION.,"writer was a man, and a very strong one."
11297,CONCLUSION.,
11298,CONCLUSION.,"Stolberg in the last century, and Colonel Mure in this, had the key"
11299,CONCLUSION.,"in the lock when they visited Trapani, each of them with the full"
11300,CONCLUSION.,"conviction that the Cyclops incident, and the hunting the goats, should"
11301,CONCLUSION.,be placed on Mt. Eryx and the island of Favognana--but they did not
11302,CONCLUSION.,"turn it. Professor Freeman, Schliemann, and Sir H. Layard, all of them"
11303,CONCLUSION.,visited Trapani and its immediate neighbourhood either as students or
11304,CONCLUSION.,"excavators, and failed to see that there was as splendid a prize to be"
11305,CONCLUSION.,"unburied there without pick and shovel, outlay, or trouble of any kind,"
11306,CONCLUSION.,"as those of Nineveh, Mycene, and Hissarlik--and why? Because they were"
11307,CONCLUSION.,still hampered by the long association of the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ as
11308,CONCLUSION.,the work of the same person. Knowing that the _Iliad_ could hardly have
11309,CONCLUSION.,been written elsewhere than in the Northern half of the West coast of
11310,CONCLUSION.,"Asia Minor, it would never occur to them to look for the _Odyssey_ in"
11311,CONCLUSION.,a spot so remote as Trapani. They probably held it to be the work of
11312,CONCLUSION.,"some prehistoric Herodotus, who would go on from scene to scene without"
11313,CONCLUSION.,"staying longer than he could help in any one place, instead of feeling"
11314,CONCLUSION.,"sure, as I believe they should have done, that it was the work of one"
11315,CONCLUSION.,who was little likely to have travelled more than a very few miles from
11316,CONCLUSION.,"her own home. Moreover, Admiralty charts are things of comparatively"
11317,CONCLUSION.,"recent date, and I do not think any one would have been likely to have"
11318,CONCLUSION.,run the _Odyssey_ to ground without their help.
11319,CONCLUSION.,
11320,CONCLUSION.,"But however this may be, I do not doubt that the habit of ascribing"
11321,CONCLUSION.,the _Odyssey_ to Homer has been the main reason of the failure to
11322,CONCLUSION.,see the obvious in connection with it. Surely it is time our eminent
11323,CONCLUSION.,Iliadic and Odyssean scholars left off misleading themselves and other
11324,CONCLUSION.,"people by including the _Odyssey_ in their ""Introductions"" to the work"
11325,CONCLUSION.,"of ""Homer."" It was permissible to do this till within recent years;"
11326,CONCLUSION.,"anything else, indeed, would have been pedantic, but what would have"
11327,CONCLUSION.,"been pedantic a hundred years ago, is slovenly and unscholarly now."
11328,CONCLUSION.,
11329,CONCLUSION.,"Turning from her commentators to the authoress herself, I am tempted to"
11330,CONCLUSION.,wonder whether she would be more pleased or angry could she know that
11331,CONCLUSION.,she had been so long mistaken for a man--and that man Homer. It would
11332,CONCLUSION.,afford her an excellent opportunity for laughing at the dullness of
11333,CONCLUSION.,"man. Angry, however, as she would no doubt be, she could hardly at the"
11334,CONCLUSION.,"same time help being flattered, and would perhaps console herself by"

11340,CONCLUSION.,"many mediocre poets who are doing fairly well. So far as I can see,"
11341,CONCLUSION.,"indeed, gods, men, and more particularly publishers, will tolerate"
11342,CONCLUSION.,"nothing in a poet except mediocrity, and if a true poet by some rare"
11343,CONCLUSION.,"accident slips in among the others, it is because gods and publisher's"
11344,CONCLUSION.,readers did not find him out until it was too late to stop him. Horace
11345,CONCLUSION.,must have known perfectly well that he was talking nonsense.
11346,CONCLUSION.,
11347,CONCLUSION.,And after all it is well that things are as they are; for the mediocre
11348,CONCLUSION.,"poet, though he may hang about for many years, does in the end die, or"
11349,CONCLUSION.,at any rate become such a mere literary Struldbrug as to give plain
11350,CONCLUSION.,"people no trouble, whereas the true poet will possess himself of us,"
11351,CONCLUSION.,"and live on in us whether we will or no, and unless the numbers of"
11352,CONCLUSION.,such people were severely kept in check they would clog the wheels of
11353,CONCLUSION.,the world. Half a dozen first-class poets in prose or verse are as
11354,CONCLUSION.,"many as the world can carry in any comfort; twenty Shakspeares, twenty"
11355,CONCLUSION.,"Homers, twenty Nausicaas would make literature impossible, yet we may"
11356,CONCLUSION.,be sure that every country in every century could yield two or three
11357,CONCLUSION.,"first-class writers, if genius were to be known at once and fostered by"
11358,CONCLUSION.,those who alone know how to foster it. Genius is an offence; like all
11359,CONCLUSION.,"other offences it must needs come, but woe to that man or woman through"
11360,CONCLUSION.,"whom it comes, for he or she must pass through the Scylla and Charybdis"
11361,CONCLUSION.,"of being either torn in pieces on the one hand, or so misunderstood on"
11362,CONCLUSION.,the other as to make the slipping through with life in virtue of such
11363,CONCLUSION.,misrepresentation more mortifying than death itself.
11364,CONCLUSION.,
11365,CONCLUSION.,"Do what we may we cannot help it. Dead mind like dead body must, after"
11366,CONCLUSION.,"a decent interval, be buried out of our sight if living mind is to"
11367,CONCLUSION.,"have fair play, and it might perhaps not be a bad thing if our great"
11368,CONCLUSION.,educational establishments had more of the crematorium and less of
11369,CONCLUSION.,the catacomb about them than they have at present. Our notions of
11370,CONCLUSION.,"intellectual sanitation are deplorably imperfect, and unless the living"
11371,CONCLUSION.,become more jealous of letting dead mind remain unconsumed in their
11372,CONCLUSION.,"system, a fit of intellectual gout must ere long supervene, which, if"
11373,CONCLUSION.,"not fatal, will still be excruciatingly painful. Since, therefore,"
11374,CONCLUSION.,there are such insuperable difficulties in the way of eliminating
11375,CONCLUSION.,"geniuses when we have once absorbed them, and since also, do what we"
11376,CONCLUSION.,"may, we can no more detect the one genius who may be born among a"
11377,CONCLUSION.,"multitude of good average children, than Herod could detect the King"
11378,CONCLUSION.,"of the Jews among the babes of Bethlehem, we have no course but to do"
11379,CONCLUSION.,"much as Herod did, and lay violent hands upon all young people till"
11380,CONCLUSION.,we have reduced every single one of them to such mediocrity as may
11381,CONCLUSION.,be trusted to take itself off sooner or later. To this end we have
11382,CONCLUSION.,established schools and schoolmen; nor is it easy to see how we could
11383,CONCLUSION.,more effectually foster that self-sufficiency which does so much
11384,CONCLUSION.,"towards helping us through the world, and yet repress any exuberance of"
11385,CONCLUSION.,originality or independence of thought which may be prejudicial to its
11386,CONCLUSION.,"possessor during his own life, and burdensome to posterity when he is"
11387,CONCLUSION.,dead and gone.
11388,CONCLUSION.,
11389,CONCLUSION.,"Obviously wise, however, and necessary as our present system is, we"
11390,CONCLUSION.,nevertheless grumble at it. We would have any number of first-class
11391,CONCLUSION.,"geniuses in art literature and music, and yet have plenty of elbow room"
11392,CONCLUSION.,for ourselves. Our children too; they cannot show too many signs of
11393,CONCLUSION.,"genius, but at the same time we blame them if they do not get on in the"
11394,CONCLUSION.,world and make money as genius next to never does. Like the authoress
11395,CONCLUSION.,of the _Odyssey_ we are always wanting to have things both ways; we
11396,CONCLUSION.,"would have others be forgotten, and yet not be forgotten ourselves;"
11397,CONCLUSION.,"when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, we would fain shuffle on"
11398,CONCLUSION.,"another that shall be at once less coil and less mortal, in the good"
11399,CONCLUSION.,"thoughts of coming generations, but if this desire is so universal as"
11400,CONCLUSION.,"to be called natural, it is one which the best and sanest of us will"
11401,CONCLUSION.,fight against rather than encourage; such people will do their work
11402,CONCLUSION.,"as well and cheerfully as they can, and make room for others with as"
11403,CONCLUSION.,little fuss as possible when they have had their day.
11404,CONCLUSION.,
11405,CONCLUSION.,"If, however, any man resents the common course of nature and sets"
11406,CONCLUSION.,himself to looking upon himself and cursing his fate that he was not
11407,CONCLUSION.,born to be of the number of them that enter into life eternal even in
11408,CONCLUSION.,"this world, let him console himself by reflecting that until he is long"
11409,CONCLUSION.,"dead, there is no certain knowing whether he is in life or no, and also"
11410,CONCLUSION.,"that though he prove to be an immortal after all, he cannot escape the"
11411,CONCLUSION.,treatment which he is the more sure to meet with according as he is the
11412,CONCLUSION.,more immortal--let alone the untold misery which his works will inflict
11413,CONCLUSION.,upon young people.
11414,CONCLUSION.,
11415,CONCLUSION.,If ever a great classic could have been deterred from writing by a
11416,CONCLUSION.,"knowledge of how posterity would treat her, the writer of the _Odyssey_"
11417,CONCLUSION.,"should have been so, for never has poem more easy to understand failed"
11418,CONCLUSION.,more completely of being understood. If she was as lovely as I should
11419,CONCLUSION.,"like to think her, was ever sleeping beauty hidden behind a more"
11420,CONCLUSION.,impenetrable hedge of scholasticism? How could it be otherwise? The
11421,CONCLUSION.,"_Odyssey_, like the _Iliad_, has been a school book for nearly 3,000"
11422,CONCLUSION.,"years, and what more cruel revenge could dullness take on genius? What"
11423,CONCLUSION.,"has the erudition of the last 2,500 years done for the _Iliad_ and the"
11424,CONCLUSION.,_Odyssey_ but to emend the letter in small things and to obscure the
11425,CONCLUSION.,spirit in great ones?
11426,CONCLUSION.,
11427,CONCLUSION.,"There was indeed, as I said in my opening Chapter, a band of scholars"
11428,CONCLUSION.,a century or two before the birth of Christ who refused to see the
11429,CONCLUSION.,"_Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ as the work of the same person, but erudition"
11430,CONCLUSION.,"snubbed them and snuffed them out so effectually that for some 2,000"
11431,CONCLUSION.,years they were held to have been finally refuted. Can there be any
11432,CONCLUSION.,more scathing satire on the value of scholastic criticism? It seems as
11433,CONCLUSION.,though Minerva had shed the same darkness over both the poems that she
11434,CONCLUSION.,"shed over Ulysses, that they might go in and out among eminent Homeric"
11435,CONCLUSION.,"scholars from generation to generation, and none should see them."
11436,CONCLUSION.,
11437,CONCLUSION.,"The world does indeed know little of its greatest men and women, and"
11438,CONCLUSION.,"bitterly has it been reproached for its want of penetration, but there"
11439,CONCLUSION.,"are always two sides, and it should be remembered that its greatest"
11440,CONCLUSION.,men and women commonly know very little of the world in its more
11441,CONCLUSION.,conventional aspects. They are continually flying in the face of all
11442,CONCLUSION.,"that we expect of greatness, and they never tell us what they are; they"
11443,CONCLUSION.,do not even think that they are great; if they do we may be sure that
11444,CONCLUSION.,they are mistaken; how then can we be expected to appreciate people
11445,CONCLUSION.,correctly till we have had plenty of time to think them over?
11446,CONCLUSION.,
11447,CONCLUSION.,"And when we have thought them over, how little have our canons of"
11448,CONCLUSION.,criticism to do with the verdict which we in the end arrive at. Look at
11449,CONCLUSION.,the _Odyssey_. Here is a poem in which the hero and heroine have been
11450,CONCLUSION.,already married many years before it opens; from the first page to the
11451,CONCLUSION.,"last there is no young couple in love with one another, there is in"
11452,CONCLUSION.,"fact nothing amatory in the poem, for though the suitors are supposed"
11453,CONCLUSION.,"to be madly in love with Penelope, they never say or do anything that"
11454,CONCLUSION.,"carries conviction as to their being so. We accept the fact, as we do"
11455,CONCLUSION.,"the sagacity of Ulysses, because we are told it, not because we see it."
11456,CONCLUSION.,The interest of the poem ostensibly turns mainly on the revenge taken
11457,CONCLUSION.,"by a bald middle-aged gentleman, whose little remaining hair is red, on"
11458,CONCLUSION.,"a number of young men who have been eating him out of house and home,"
11459,CONCLUSION.,while courting his supposed widow.
11460,CONCLUSION.,
11461,CONCLUSION.,"Moreover, this subject, so initially faulty, is treated with a"
11462,CONCLUSION.,"carelessness in respect of consistency and plausibility, an ignorance"
11463,CONCLUSION.,"of commonly known details, and a disregard of ordinary canons which"
11464,CONCLUSION.,"it would not be easy to surpass, and yet, such is the irony of art"
11465,CONCLUSION.,that it is not too much to say that there is only one poem which can
11466,CONCLUSION.,be decisively placed above it. If the _Odyssey_ enforces one artistic
11467,CONCLUSION.,"truth more than another, it is that living permanent work in literature"
11468,CONCLUSION.,(and the same holds good for art and music) can only be done by those
11469,CONCLUSION.,"who are either above, or below, conscious reference to any rules or"
11470,CONCLUSION.,"canons whatsoever--and in spite of Shakespeare, Handel, and Rembrandt,"
11471,CONCLUSION.,I should say that on the whole it is more blessed to be below than
11472,CONCLUSION.,above. For after all it is not the outward and visible signs of what
11473,CONCLUSION.,"we read, see, or hear, in any work, that bring us to its feet in"
11474,CONCLUSION.,prostration of gratitude and affection; what really stirs us is the
11475,CONCLUSION.,communion with the still living mind of the man or woman to whom we owe
11476,CONCLUSION.,"it, and the conviction that that mind is as we would have our own to"
11477,CONCLUSION.,be. All else is mere clothes and grammar.
11478,CONCLUSION.,
11479,CONCLUSION.,As regards the mind of the writer of the _Odyssey_ there is nothing in
11480,CONCLUSION.,her work which impresses me more profoundly than the undercurrent of
11481,CONCLUSION.,melancholy which I feel throughout it. I do not mean that the writer
11482,CONCLUSION.,"was always, or indeed generally, unhappy; she was often, at any rate"
11483,CONCLUSION.,"let us hope so, supremely happy; nevertheless there is throughout"
11484,CONCLUSION.,her work a sense as though the world for all its joyousness was
11485,CONCLUSION.,"nevertheless out of joint--an inarticulate indefinable half pathos,"
11486,CONCLUSION.,"half baffled fury, which even when lost sight of for a time soon"
11487,CONCLUSION.,"re-asserts itself. If the _Odyssey_ was not written without laughter,"
11488,CONCLUSION.,so neither was it without tears. Now that I know the writer to have
11489,CONCLUSION.,"been a woman, I am ashamed of myself for not having been guided to my"
11490,CONCLUSION.,conclusion by the exquisitely subtle sense of weakness as well as of
11491,CONCLUSION.,"strength that pervades the poem, rather than by the considerations that"
11492,CONCLUSION.,actually guided me.
11493,CONCLUSION.,
11494,CONCLUSION.,The only approach to argument which I have seen brought forward to
11495,CONCLUSION.,"show that the _Odyssey_ must have been written by a man, consists in"
11496,CONCLUSION.,maintaining that no woman could have written the scene in which Ulysses
11497,CONCLUSION.,kills the suitors. I cannot see this; to me it seems rather that no
11498,CONCLUSION.,man could have brought himself to disregard probability with so little
11499,CONCLUSION.,compunction; moreover a woman can kill a man on paper as well as a
11500,CONCLUSION.,"man can, and with the exception of the delightful episode in which"
11501,CONCLUSION.,"Ulysses spares the lives of Phemius and Medon, the scene, I confess,"
11502,CONCLUSION.,appears to me to be the most mechanical and least satisfactory in the
11503,CONCLUSION.,whole poem. The real obstacle to a general belief that the _Odyssey_
11504,CONCLUSION.,"was written by a woman is not anything that can be found in the poem,"
11505,CONCLUSION.,"but lies, as I have already said, in the long prevalence of an opinion"
11506,CONCLUSION.,that it was written by the same person as the _Iliad_ was. The age and
11507,CONCLUSION.,"respectability of this opinion, even though we have at length discarded"
11508,CONCLUSION.,"it, will not allow us to go beyond ascribing the _Odyssey_ to another"
11509,CONCLUSION.,man--we cannot jump all at once to the view that it was not by a man at
11510,CONCLUSION.,all. A certain invincible scholasticism prevents us from being able to
11511,CONCLUSION.,see what we should see at once if we would only read the poem slowly
11512,CONCLUSION.,and without considering anything that critics have said concerning it.
11513,CONCLUSION.,
11514,CONCLUSION.,"This, however, is not an easy thing to do. I know very well that I"
11515,CONCLUSION.,should never have succeeded in doing it if I had not passed some
11516,CONCLUSION.,five-and-thirty rebellious years during which I never gave the
11517,CONCLUSION.,_Odyssey_ so much as a thought. The poem is so august: it is hallowed
11518,CONCLUSION.,"by the veneration of so many ages; it is like my frontispiece, so"
11519,CONCLUSION.,"mysterious, so imperfect, and yet so divinely beyond all perfection;"
11520,CONCLUSION.,it has been so long associated with the epic poem which stands
11521,CONCLUSION.,"supreme--for if the _Odyssey_ be the Monte Rosa of literature, the"
11522,CONCLUSION.,"_Iliad_ must, I suppose, for ever remain as the Mont Blanc; who can"
11523,CONCLUSION.,lightly vivisect a work of such ineffable prestige as though it were an
11524,CONCLUSION.,overlooked _parvenu_ book picked up for a few pence at a second hand
11525,CONCLUSION.,"book stall? Lightly, no, but inexorably, yes, if its natural health and"
11526,CONCLUSION.,beauty are to be restored by doing so.
11527,CONCLUSION.,
11528,CONCLUSION.,One of our most accomplished living scholars chided with me in this
11529,CONCLUSION.,"sense a year or two ago. He said I was ruthless. ""I confess,"" he said,"
11530,CONCLUSION.,"""I do not give much heed to the details on which you lay so much"
11531,CONCLUSION.,"stress: I read the poem not to theorise about it, but to revel in its"
11532,CONCLUSION.,"amazing beauty."""
11533,CONCLUSION.,
11534,CONCLUSION.,It would shock me to think that I had done anything to impair the sense
11535,CONCLUSION.,"of that beauty which I trust I share in even measure with himself, but"
11536,CONCLUSION.,"surely if the _Odyssey_ has charmed us as a man's work, its charm and"
11537,CONCLUSION.,wonder are infinitely increased when we see it as a woman's. Still
11538,CONCLUSION.,"more must it charm us when we find the writer to be an old friend,"
11539,CONCLUSION.,and see no inconsiderable part of her work as a reflection of her own
11540,CONCLUSION.,surroundings.
11541,CONCLUSION.,
11542,CONCLUSION.,"Have we, then, a right in sober seriousness so to find her? I have"
11543,CONCLUSION.,shown that in the earliest known ages of Greek literature poetesses
11544,CONCLUSION.,"abounded, and gained a high reputation. I have shown that by universal"
11545,CONCLUSION.,consent the domestic and female interest in the _Odyssey_ predominates
11546,CONCLUSION.,greatly over the male. I have shown that it was all written in one
11547,CONCLUSION.,"place, and if so--even were there no further reasons for thinking"
11548,CONCLUSION.,so--presumably by one hand: I have shown that the writer was extremely
11549,CONCLUSION.,"jealous for the honour of woman, so much so as to be daunted by no"
11550,CONCLUSION.,impossibilities when trying to get rid of a story that she held to be
11551,CONCLUSION.,"an insult to her sex. These things being so, is it too much to ask the"
11552,CONCLUSION.,"reader to believe that the poem was not written, as Bentley held, by"
11553,CONCLUSION.,"a man for women, but for both men and women, by one who was herself a"
11554,CONCLUSION.,woman?
11555,CONCLUSION.,
11556,CONCLUSION.,"And now as I take leave of the reader, I would say that if when I began"
11557,CONCLUSION.,this work I was oppressed with a sense of the hopelessness of getting
11558,CONCLUSION.,"Homeric scholars to take it seriously and consider it, I am even more"
11559,CONCLUSION.,oppressed and dismayed when I turn over its pages and see how certain
11560,CONCLUSION.,they are to displease many whom I would far rather conciliate than
11561,CONCLUSION.,"offend. What can it matter to me where the _Odyssey_ was written, or"
11562,CONCLUSION.,whether it was written by a man or a woman? From the bottom of my heart
11563,CONCLUSION.,I can say truly that I do not care about the way in which these points
11564,CONCLUSION.,"are decided, but I do care, and very greatly, about knowing which way"
11565,CONCLUSION.,they are decided by sensible people who have considered what I have
11566,CONCLUSION.,"urged in this book. I believe I have settled both points sufficiently,"
11567,CONCLUSION.,but come what may I know that my case in respect of them is amply
11568,CONCLUSION.,strong enough to justify me in having stated it. And so I leave it.
