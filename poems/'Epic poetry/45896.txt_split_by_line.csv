51,PREFACE,PREFACE
52,PREFACE,
53,PREFACE,
54,PREFACE,"In 1895 I published _Homer and the Epic_ (pp. 424), containing a"
55,PREFACE,"criticism of Wolf's theory, if theory it can be called, which is"
56,PREFACE,"the mother of modern Homeric criticism. I analysed, book by book,"
57,PREFACE,"the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_, observing on the modern ideas of"
58,PREFACE,interpolation and the modern objections to many scores of passages
59,PREFACE,"which, as a rule, I defended from charges of ""lateness"" and"
60,PREFACE,inconsistency.
61,PREFACE,
62,PREFACE,"I added chapters on the Lost Epics of Greece, on Archeology, and on the"
63,PREFACE,"early Epic poetry of other ages and peoples which offers analogies,"
64,PREFACE,"more or less imperfect, with Homer."
65,PREFACE,
66,PREFACE,On the whole my conclusions were identical with those of Signor
67,PREFACE,"Comparetti, in his preface to his learned book on the Finnish"
68,PREFACE,_Kalewala_. He says:
69,PREFACE,
70,PREFACE,"""The anatomical and conjectural analysis which has been applied so"
71,PREFACE,"often and so long ... to the Homeric poems and other national epics,"
72,PREFACE,"proceeds from an universal abstract principle, which is correct, and"
73,PREFACE,"from a concrete application of that principle, which is imaginary and"
74,PREFACE,"groundless."""
75,PREFACE,
76,PREFACE,"The true principle, recognised since the end of the eighteenth century,"
77,PREFACE,"separates the ""personal"" and learned Art Epics, like the _Æneid_ and"
78,PREFACE,"the _Gerusalemme Liberata_, from those which belong to the period of"
79,PREFACE,"spontaneous epic production, ""when Folk-singers fashioned many epic"
80,PREFACE,"lays of small or moderate compass."" (Perhaps Folk-singers is hardly the"
81,PREFACE,"right term. Such songs of exploits as the Borderers ""made themselves,"""
82,PREFACE,"as Bishop Lesley said in 1578, were not ""epic lays,"" but ballads like"
83,PREFACE,"""Jock o' the Side,"" and ""Archie o' Cafield,"" and ""Johnie Cock,"" despite"
84,PREFACE,its name the most romantic of all.)
85,PREFACE,
86,PREFACE,"""These epic lays were called 'national' or 'popular,' not only by"
87,PREFACE,"virtue of their contents, sentiment, and audience, but mainly because"
88,PREFACE,"the poetry which takes this form is natural, collective, popular, and"
89,PREFACE,"hence 'national' in its origin and development."" (By ""collective"""
90,PREFACE,"I understand the author to mean, not that a whole country-side"
91,PREFACE,"automatically and collectively bellows out a new ballad, but that the"
92,PREFACE,"original author uses traditional formulae in verse wherever he can,"
93,PREFACE,"and that his ballad is altered in the course of recitation by others,"
94,PREFACE,"so that any version which has been obtained from recitation is, in"
95,PREFACE,"fact, one of many variants which have arisen in course of time and"
96,PREFACE,recitation.)
97,PREFACE,
98,PREFACE,"""The baseless application of this principle is to regard the national"
99,PREFACE,"poems not as creations of a single poet, but as put together out of"
100,PREFACE,"shorter pre-existing lays (either by a single person at one time, or"
101,PREFACE,"by several in succession), until the final fashioning of the poem. And"
102,PREFACE,"this process is conceived of as a mere stringing together, without any"
103,PREFACE,"sort of fusion, so that a critical philologist, thanks to his special"
104,PREFACE,"sharpness and by aid of certain criteria, would be in a position to"
105,PREFACE,"recognise the joinings, and to recover the lays out of which the poem"
106,PREFACE,has been made up.
107,PREFACE,
108,PREFACE,"""With this preconceived idea people have gone on anatomising the Epics;"
109,PREFACE,"from Lachmann to the present day they have not desisted, although so"
110,PREFACE,far no positive satisfactory and harmonious results have been won. This
111,PREFACE,"restless business of analysis, which has lasted so long, impatient of"
112,PREFACE,"its own fruitlessness, yet unconvinced of it, builds up and pulls down,"
113,PREFACE,"and builds again, while its shifting foundations, its insufficient and"
114,PREFACE,"falsely applied criteria, condemn it to remain fruitless, tedious, and"
115,PREFACE,repulsive. The observer marks with amazement the degree of intellectual
116,PREFACE,shortsightedness produced by excessive and exclusive analysis. The
117,PREFACE,"investigator becomes a sort of man-microscope, who can see atoms but"
118,PREFACE,"not bodies; motes, and these magnified, but not beams."""
119,PREFACE,
120,PREFACE,"Comparetti proceeds: ""No doubt before the epic there existed the"
121,PREFACE,shorter lays; but what is the relation of the lays to the epic? Is the
122,PREFACE,"epic a mere material synthesis of lays, or does it stand to them as"
123,PREFACE,"a thing higher in the scale of poetic organisms,--does it move on a"
124,PREFACE,"loftier plane, attaining higher, broader conceptions, and a new style"
125,PREFACE,"appropriate to these?"" Notoriously the epic infinitely transcends in"
126,PREFACE,"scale, breadth of conception, and grandeur of style any brief popular"
127,PREFACE,lays of which we have knowledge. It never was made by stringing _them_
128,PREFACE,together.
129,PREFACE,
130,PREFACE,"So much for the little lay theory. ""But there remains the nucleus"
131,PREFACE,"theory"" (the theory of ""the kernel""), ""for example of an original"
132,PREFACE,"Achilleis"" (the _Menis_) expanded by self-denying poets into an"
133,PREFACE,"_Iliad_. Comparetti does not believe that a poet would fashion lays ""to"
134,PREFACE,"be inserted in a greater work already constructed by others, nor that"
135,PREFACE,"he would have done this with so much regard for other men's work, and"
136,PREFACE,"with such strict limitation of his own, that the modern erudite can"
137,PREFACE,"recognise the joinings, and distinguish the original kernel and each of"
138,PREFACE,"the later additions."""
139,PREFACE,
140,PREFACE,"Here Wolf anticipated Comparetti, he did not believe that the additions"
141,PREFACE,could be detected.
142,PREFACE,
143,PREFACE,But Comparetti does not reckon with his host. The astute critics tell
144,PREFACE,"us that the later poets did _not_ compose ""with so much respect for"
145,PREFACE,"other men's work""; far from that, the poet of _Iliad_ ix. calmly turned"
146,PREFACE,"the work of the poet of _Iliad_ xvi. into nonsense, we are told (see"
147,PREFACE,"_infra_, ""The Great Discrepancies""). Again, the critics will say that a"
148,PREFACE,"later poet did not ""fashion lays to be inserted in another man's work."""
149,PREFACE,"He merely fashioned lays. Much later other men, the Pisistratean, or"
150,PREFACE,"Solonian, or Hipparchian Committee of Recension, took his lays and"
151,PREFACE,"foisted them into the middle of another man's work, making every kind"
152,PREFACE,of blunder and discrepancy in the process of making everything smooth
153,PREFACE,and neat.
154,PREFACE,
155,PREFACE,"Comparetti goes on: ""The difficulty is increased when we have to do"
156,PREFACE,with epics which seem in all their parts to be composed on a definite
157,PREFACE,"plan, which exists in the final poem, not in the supposed kernel. The"
158,PREFACE,"organic unity, the harmony, the relation of all the portions, which"
159,PREFACE,"are arranged so as to lead up to the final catastrophe, are such as to"
160,PREFACE,imply the agreement and homogeneity of the poetic creation in a common
161,PREFACE,"idea, and, moreover, resting on that idea--a limitation of the creative"
162,PREFACE,"processes."""
163,PREFACE,
164,PREFACE,"Comparetti, I fear, forgets that his ""man-microscopes"" see none of"
165,PREFACE,"these things; ""they see the mote, not the beam."" Finally, granting"
166,PREFACE,"the pre-existence of a mass of poetic material, ""He who could extract"
167,PREFACE,"from this mass the epics which we possess, and not a kind of Greek"
168,PREFACE,"_Mahabharata_, would have produced, at all events, such a work of"
169,PREFACE,"genius that in fairness he must be called not merely the redactor, but"
170,PREFACE,"the author and poet."""
171,PREFACE,
172,PREFACE,"How true is all that Comparetti says of ""this restless business of"
173,PREFACE,"analysis, which has lasted so long, impatient of its own fruitlessness,"
174,PREFACE,"yet unconvinced of it! It builds up, and pulls down, and builds again,"
175,PREFACE,while its insufficient and falsely applied criteria condemn it to
176,PREFACE,"remain fruitless, tedious, and repulsive."""
177,PREFACE,
178,PREFACE,"""Our little systems have their day."" ""They have their day, and cease"
179,PREFACE,"to be."" The little system which explained the _Iliad_ as a mass, or"
180,PREFACE,"rather a concatenation of short lays, ""has had its day."" The system"
181,PREFACE,"of a primal ""kernel"" (Books i., xi., xvi., and so forth)--a kernel"
182,PREFACE,"more archaic in language than Books ix., x., xxiii., xxiv.--is also"
183,PREFACE,"perishing, ""stricken through with doubt."" The linguistic analysis"
184,PREFACE,"of Miss Stawell (_Homer and the Iliad_, 1909) and, in America, of"
185,PREFACE,"Professor Scott, has fatally damaged the linguistic tests of books for"
186,PREFACE,earliness and lateness.
187,PREFACE,
188,PREFACE,The most advanced German critics find that Book i. of the _Iliad_ is
189,PREFACE,"no longer that genuine kernel which, with certain other passages,"
190,PREFACE,"represents the primal _Menis_, or ""wrath of Achilles,"" as opposed to"
191,PREFACE,the later accretions of three or four centuries. _Das ist ausgespielt!_
192,PREFACE,"The ""kernel"" hypothesis is doomed. Its cornerstone--Book i. of the"
193,PREFACE,"_Iliad_, is, by the builders of new theories, rejected; it is now"
194,PREFACE,one of the latest additions to the _Iliad_.[1] Only to one point is
195,PREFACE,criticism steadfast. The _Iliad must_ be a thing of rags and tatters;
196,PREFACE,and it is torn up by the process of misstating its statements and
197,PREFACE,"finding ""discrepancies"" in the statements misstated."
198,PREFACE,
199,PREFACE,"Again, as even Comparetti's ""man-microscopes"" could not well help"
200,PREFACE,"seeing that the epics, though not good enough as compositions for them,"
201,PREFACE,"still _are_ compositions; have, in a way, organic unity, harmony,"
202,PREFACE,"adjusted relations of all the portions, some critics tried to account"
203,PREFACE,"for the facts as the result of the labours of the Pisistratean, or"
204,PREFACE,"Solonian, or Hipparchian Committee of Recension at Athens, in the sixth"
205,PREFACE,century B.C. But so many critics of all shades of opinion have rejected
206,PREFACE,"this hypothesis, even with scorn, as ""a worthless fable,"" ""an absurd"
207,PREFACE,"legend,"" part of Homeric mythology (Blass, Meyer, Mr. T. W. Alien, D."
208,PREFACE,"B. Monro, Nutzhorn, Grote, and many others), that it can scarcely be"
209,PREFACE,restored even by the learned ingenuity of Mr. Verrall.[2]
210,PREFACE,
211,PREFACE,"In defect of the late Recension, which is wholly destitute of historic"
212,PREFACE,"evidence, a poet, a _Dichter_, has to be sought somewhere, and at some"
213,PREFACE,"period of the supposed ""evolution"" of the _Iliad_. He may lawfully"
214,PREFACE,"be sought, it seems, at any period of the history of the poem, except"
215,PREFACE,"at the point where, in fact, the poet is always found, namely at the"
216,PREFACE,beginning. The search for the poet will never find him anywhere else.
217,PREFACE,He cannot be made to fit into the eighth or seventh or sixth century;
218,PREFACE,it is useless to look for him at the Court of Croesus! A poem purely
219,PREFACE,Achaean had an Achaean author.
220,PREFACE,
221,PREFACE,None of the many critical keys fits the lock. The linguistic key breaks
222,PREFACE,"itself, it cannot break the wards."
223,PREFACE,
224,PREFACE,Archaeology is used as a test of passages very early and very late;
225,PREFACE,"and the archaeology is also wrong, demonstrably fallacious. The"
226,PREFACE,"archaeologists themselves, Mr. Arthur Evans and Mr. Ridgeway, will"
227,PREFACE,"have none of Reichel's key. Whatever archaeology may prove, it does"
228,PREFACE,not prove what Reichel and his followers believed it to demonstrate.
229,PREFACE,If I succeed in convincing any separatist critics that the costume and
230,PREFACE,armour in the _Iliad_ are much less like the costume and armour of
231,PREFACE,Ionia in the seventh century B.C. than like those of Athens at the end
232,PREFACE,"of the sixth and beginning of the fifth centuries, these critics will"
233,PREFACE,"probably be grateful. Here, they may perhaps say, is proof of our late"
234,PREFACE,"Athenian recension, by which the actual Athenian dress and armour of"
235,PREFACE,540-480 were written into the ancient poems.
236,PREFACE,
237,PREFACE,I would agree with them if the members of the Committee of Recension
238,PREFACE,"had excised the huge Homeric shields, introduced cavalry in place of"
239,PREFACE,"chariotry, iron instead of bronze weapons; excised the bride-price"
240,PREFACE,"in marriage law, introduced the rite of purification of homicides by"
241,PREFACE,"pigs' blood, and generally, in a score of other ways, for example by"
242,PREFACE,"introducing hero-worship, had brought the _Iliad_ ""up to date."" But as"
243,PREFACE,I cannot easily conceive that _only_ armour and costume were brought
244,PREFACE,"up to date, I suppose that the whirligig of time and fashion had"
245,PREFACE,reverted in Athens to hauberks of scales in place of the uniform use
246,PREFACE,"of back-plate and breast-plate, and had also deserted the Ionian and"
247,PREFACE,"early Hellenic _cypassis,_ the Aegean loin-cloth or bathing-drawers for"
248,PREFACE,the longer and loose Homeric chiton.
249,PREFACE,
250,PREFACE,"If each critic would publish his own polychrome _Iliad_, with"
251,PREFACE,"""primitive"" passages printed in gold, ""secondary"" in red, ""tertiary"" in"
252,PREFACE,"blue, ""very late"" in green, with orange for ""the Pisistratean editor,"""
253,PREFACE,"purple for the ""diaskeuast,"" and mauve for ""fragments of older epics"""
254,PREFACE,"stuck in the context, and so on, the differences that prevail among the"
255,PREFACE,professors of the Higher Criticism would be amazingly apparent.
256,PREFACE,
257,PREFACE,"One writer of a book on Homer has accused me of neglecting ""science"" in"
258,PREFACE,"favour of mere literary appreciation, and of ""trying to set back the"
259,PREFACE,"hands on the clock of criticism."" Really I want to clean and regulate"
260,PREFACE,"that timepiece, which reminds one of"
261,PREFACE,
262,PREFACE,"""The crazy old church-clock"
263,PREFACE,"And the bewildered chimes,"""
264,PREFACE,
265,PREFACE,in Wordsworth's poem.
266,PREFACE,
267,PREFACE,"Never were chimes more bewildered, verdicts more various, and"
268,PREFACE,contradictions in terms more innocently combined than in the higher
269,PREFACE,criticism of Homer. It is necessary and right that men's opinions
270,PREFACE,"should alter, in consequence of reflection, and of the increase of"
271,PREFACE,"our knowledge of prehistoric Greece, through the revelations of"
272,PREFACE,excavators on the ancient sites of a rediscovered world. It is natural
273,PREFACE,that Homeric critics should sometimes contradict themselves and each
274,PREFACE,other. But they contradict each other so constantly and confidently
275,PREFACE,"that, clearly, their conclusions are not to be called conclusions of"
276,PREFACE,_science_.
277,PREFACE,
278,PREFACE,"That in one book a critic should reject, let us say, the hypothesis"
279,PREFACE,"of the ""Pisistratean recension"" of the epics, and, in his next book,"
280,PREFACE,"accept it, is nothing. Reflection has caused him to change his opinion."
281,PREFACE,"But when, in one book, in one chapter, perhaps in one page, a critic,"
282,PREFACE,"without perceiving it, bases his argument on contradictions in"
283,PREFACE,"terms, then his house is founded on the sand, and needs no tempest to"
284,PREFACE,overthrow its pinnacles and towers.
285,PREFACE,
286,PREFACE,"Through indulgence in fantastic theory-making, and through disregard of"
287,PREFACE,"logical consistency, Homeric criticism has become, as Blass vigorously"
288,PREFACE,"put the case in his latest work, ""a swamp haunted by wandering fires,"
289,PREFACE,"will-o'-the-wisps."""
290,PREFACE,
291,PREFACE,"In 1906, in _Homer and his Age_, I again studied the Homeric Question,"
292,PREFACE,"with particular reference to fresh archaeological discoveries, and"
293,PREFACE,"to the contradictory methods, as I reckon them, which critics have"
294,PREFACE,"employed in the effort to prove that the Homeric epics are mosaics,"
295,PREFACE,"composed in, and confusing the manners and usages of, four or five"
296,PREFACE,prehistoric and proto-historic ages.
297,PREFACE,
298,PREFACE,I do not now reprint either of my earlier books on Homer. Further
299,PREFACE,study appears to have made many points more clear than they were. It
300,PREFACE,"is especially clear that ""the Ionian father of the rest,"" as Tennyson"
301,PREFACE,"calls Homer, is _not_ Ionian; that the early Ionian settlers in Asia"
302,PREFACE,"respected Homer's matter, which is Achaean, and did not intermingle"
303,PREFACE,"with it any traits of their own very different beliefs, rites, tastes,"
304,PREFACE,"morals, usages, armour and costume."
305,PREFACE,
306,PREFACE,"By the term ""Ionian"" I here mean to speak of the works composed in the"
307,PREFACE,"Ionian settlements in Asia, probably in the eighth to seventh centuries"
308,PREFACE,"B.C., and of the non-Homeric beliefs, rites, usages, costume and armour"
309,PREFACE,"of the same people and period. Most of these beliefs, usages, and rites"
310,PREFACE,"also mark historic Hellas, and very probably existed in the early"
311,PREFACE,populations of Greece before the dominance of Homer's Achaeans.
312,PREFACE,
313,PREFACE,"On the chronological period, as determined by archaeology, in which"
314,PREFACE,"the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ were composed, I am fortunate in having the"
315,PREFACE,"support of Mr. Arthur Evans, the chief authority in this matter; while"
316,PREFACE,"Mr. T. W. Allen, our leading textual critic, is persuaded of the fact"
317,PREFACE,"of Homeric unity. Where language is concerned (as has been said),"
318,PREFACE,the linguistic Appendices to Miss Stawell's _Homer and the Iliad_
319,PREFACE,"(1909), with the minute and elaborate studies of Professor Scott of"
320,PREFACE,"the North-Western University, Illinois,[3] seem to me to overthrow"
321,PREFACE,the separatist conclusions as to the presence of an earlier stage of
322,PREFACE,"language and metre in some books; a later, or ""Odyssean"" stage in other"
323,PREFACE,books of the _Iliad_. I have seen scarcely any public criticism in
324,PREFACE,"reply to Miss Stawell and Professor Scott on these essential points, in"
325,PREFACE,which I have not scholarship enough to pretend to be a judge.
326,PREFACE,
327,PREFACE,"Meanwhile my friend, Mr. Shewan, has in preparation a comprehensive"
328,PREFACE,"criticism of the separatist arguments, especially those drawn from"
329,PREFACE,"language and metre; a work which, I venture to think, it will not be"
330,PREFACE,"easy, and will not be fair, to ignore."
331,PREFACE,
332,PREFACE,"All my writings on the Homeric question are, necessarily,"
333,PREFACE,"controversial. The reaction against the suggestion of Wolf, against"
334,PREFACE,"a critical tradition of a century's standing, has begun in earnest."
335,PREFACE,"But the friends of that tradition are eminently learned, and occupy"
336,PREFACE,"the highest places in scholarship and education. Scholars as eminent,"
337,PREFACE,"who differ from them, as a rule, are content to keep their own"
338,PREFACE,"opinions, and remain silent. If the views of the reaction, of the"
339,PREFACE,"believers in Homeric unity, in the epics as the wonderful legacy"
340,PREFACE,"of the brief prehistoric Achaean age, are to prevail, the opposing"
341,PREFACE,"ideas must be assailed, and if possible confuted. In all controversy"
342,PREFACE,the constant danger is the tendency to misunderstand opponents. As a
343,PREFACE,"rule, A. supposes B. to be holding this or that position. A. assails"
344,PREFACE,"and captures it, but B. was holding quite another position. A. has"
345,PREFACE,"misunderstood his case. Critics of works of mine, on other subjects,"
346,PREFACE,"have often missed my meaning, and I am therefore constrained to"
347,PREFACE,"suppose that I may have, in like manner, misconstrued some of the"
348,PREFACE,"opinions of others, which, as I understand them, I am obliged to"
349,PREFACE,"contest. I have done my best to understand, and will deeply regret any"
350,PREFACE,failures of interpretation on my part.
351,PREFACE,
352,PREFACE,"Mr. Gilbert Murray, whose opinions I am obliged to oppose in the"
353,PREFACE,"course of ""the struggle for existence,"" has, with very great kindness"
354,PREFACE,"and courtesy, read my proof sheets, and enabled me to give a less"
355,PREFACE,inaccurate statement of his position. On one point where I had
356,PREFACE,"misapprehended it, I have added an Appendix, ""The Lost Epics and the"
357,PREFACE,"Homeric Epics."""
358,PREFACE,
359,PREFACE,"I owe more than I can easily express to the kindness of my friend, Mr."
360,PREFACE,"A. Shewan, of St. Andrews, who read and corrected my first proofs (any"
361,PREFACE,"surviving errors are due to my own want of care), and who has lent me"
362,PREFACE,books and papers from his Homeric collection.
363,PREFACE,
364,PREFACE,"Mr. R. M. Dawkins, Head of the British School of Athens, has had the"
365,PREFACE,"goodness to read my chapters on Homeric, Ionian, and historic armour"
366,PREFACE,"and costume, and I have quoted the gist of his letters on points"
367,PREFACE,where he differs from my conclusions. The topic of female costume is
368,PREFACE,peculiarly difficult and disputable.

578,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"If this be true, the Homeric world as depicted in the poems existed"
579,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,only in fancy; it is a medley of four periods extending over some six
580,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"centuries or more, and the Homeric picture must be a mere chaos as"
581,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"regards costume, manners, rites, armour, tactics, laws, geographical"

583,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"critics say that it is, and seek for proof in the poems. They find"
584,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"anachronisms and inconsistencies as to armour (but not costume), as to"
585,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"rites, as to marriage laws, as to houses, as to tactics, as to land"

590,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"For the Homeric period, except in the case of the _fibulae_ marking"

593,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,characteristic contents have been discovered by modern scientific
594,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"experts, a point to be discussed later. But for our Fourth Age we have"
595,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"literary evidence, that of the remains and epitomes of the Cyclic"
596,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"poems, composed in Ionia, about the eighth to seventh centuries, by"
597,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"the poets of the Ionian settlers in Asia, who were dominated by Attic,"
598,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"not Achaean traditions. These poems, we are to show (see ""The Cyclic"
599,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"Poems"") differ immensely, in descriptions of rites and of religion,"
600,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"and in the characters of heroes, in their pseudo-historic legends,"
601,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"and in geographical knowledge, from the pictures given by Homer. The"

609,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,"personages, and traditions, are never intruded into our Homeric epics."
610,HOMER'S WORLD. THE FOUR AGES,The two ages stand apart. The Homeric world is not that of the Fourth

737,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
738,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
739,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,Homer conceives of his heroes as living in an age indefinitely remote:
740,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"their epoch ""has won its way to the mythical."" They are often sons"
741,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"or grandsons of Gods: the Gods walk the earth among them, friendly,"
742,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"amorous, or hostile. From this fact, more than from the degeneracy in"
743,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"physical force which Homer often attributes to his contemporaries, we"
744,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,see that the mist of time and the glamour of romance have closed over
745,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,the heroes.
746,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
747,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,But this might happen in the course of a pair of centuries. In the
748,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"French _Chansons de Geste_ of 1080-1300, Charlemagne (_circ_. 814), a"
749,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"perfectly historical character to us,--has become almost as mythical"
750,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,as Arthur to the poets. He conquers Saracens as Arthur conquers all
751,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,western Europe; he visits Constantinople; he is counselled by visible
752,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"angels, who to some degree play the part of the gods in Homer."
753,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
754,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,Perhaps two or three centuries may separate Homer from any actual
755,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,heroic princes of whom traditions have reached him. Modern research
756,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"holds that the Achaeans of Homer, by infiltration and by conquest, had"
757,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,succeeded to more civilised owners of Greece.
758,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
759,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,But Homer has nothing to say about a conquest of Greece by the
760,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Achaeans, Danaans, Argives, and the rest, from the north, except in"
761,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,two cases. He speaks of combats with wild mountain-dwelling tribes in
762,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Thessaly, in Nestor's youth. Nestor knew ""the strongest of men who"
763,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"warred with the strongest, the mountain-dwelling Pheres,""[1] shaggy"
764,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"folk, says the _Catalogue_, whom Peirithous drove out of Pelion in"
765,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"northern Thessaly, and forced back on the Aethices of Pindus in the"
766,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"west.[2] It appears, from recent excavations, that the age of stone"
767,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"lingered long in these regions, and the people were probably rude and"
768,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"uncultivated, like the Centaurs."
769,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
770,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"The recent excavators of Zerelia, north-east of the Spercheios valley,"
771,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"the home of Achilles, write that their discoveries in the soil ""clearly"
772,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,point to the fact that in prehistoric times the cultures of North
773,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,and South Greece were radically different. This probably indicates
774,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"an ethnological difference as well.""[3] Before the period when ""Late"
775,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Minoan III."" pottery occurs in Thessaly, the people used stone tools"
776,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"and weapons, and knew not the potter's wheel. It may not, therefore, be"
777,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,too fanciful to regard Nestor's tales of fights with a wild mountain
778,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"race as shadowy memories of actual Achaean conquests in Thessaly, where"
779,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,Aegean culture arrived very much later than in Southern Greece.
780,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
781,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Secondly, Homer twice speaks of regions as ""Pelasgian,"" in which"
782,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"he represents the actual inhabitants as Hellenes and Achaeans, not"
783,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,Pelasgic. These regions are the realm of Achilles in south-west
784,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,Thessaly; and Epirus.[4] But the actual Pelasgians whom Homer knows
785,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,are allies of Troy; they dwell on the North Aegean coasts (where
786,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Herodotus found living Pelasgians), or reside, with Achaeans,"
787,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Dorians, True Cretans, and Cydonians, in Crete. These facts indicate"
788,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Homer's knowledge that, in some regions, Achaeans had dispossessed"
789,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"""Pelasgians,"" whoever the Pelasgians may have been. Again, Homer makes"
790,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Achilles address the ""Pelasgic Zeus"" of Dodona in Epirus, in which he"
791,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,locates Perhaebians and Eneienes.
792,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
793,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,It thus appears that he supposed the Achaeans to have driven out
794,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Pelasgians from Epirus and Thessaly, at least, if not from southern"
795,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,Greece. It may well seem to us strange that as the Achaean settlement
796,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"in Crete, or at least in parts of Crete, must have been comparatively"
797,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"recent when Homer sang, he never mentions so great an event. But"
798,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"reasons for and a parallel to his silence are not hard to find. If,"
799,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"as many authorities hold, the great Cnossian palace had fallen, and"
800,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,the Cretan civilisation had sunk into decadence before the Achaeans
801,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"_arrived in the island_,[5] they might meet with but slight resistance;"
802,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"great feats of heroism might not claim record. Again, the Norman"
803,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,Conquest gave rise to no Anglo-Norman epic. The invaders already
804,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"possessed their epic tradition, that of Charlemagne, borrowed from"
805,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"""the Franks of France,"" while they presently, in the twelfth century,"
806,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"took up and expanded the epic traditions of the Welsh and Bretons,"
807,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"in the Arthurian cycles of romances. In the same way, for all that"
808,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"we know, the Achaean epics may have a basis in the traditions of the"
809,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"earlier and more civilised populations usually styled ""Pelasgians."""
810,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"The manners, however, of the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ are Achaean, as the"
811,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"manners of the French romances of Arthur are not Celtic, but feudal and"
812,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"chivalrous.[6] Homer, in any case, conceives of his own race as at home"
813,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"in Greece and Crete, and he has nothing to say about Greek settlements"
814,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,on the Asiatic coast. To him the inhabitants of Miletus are not the
815,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Ionian colonists. ""Carians uncouth of speech"" dwelt by the banks of"
816,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"the Meander, and the Asiatic allies of Priam are people ""scattered, of"
817,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"diverse tongues.""[7] For purposes of convenience all parties to the"
818,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,war understand each other's speech.[8]
819,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
820,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"In _Odyssey_, xix. 172-177, Homer gives an account of populous Crete,"
821,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"with ninety cities, and a mingling of various tongues, ""therein are"
822,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Achaeans, and True Cretans high of heart, and Cydonians, and Dorians"
823,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"in their three divisions, and noble Pelasgians."" Did they vary in"
824,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"language, or in dialect and accent merely? We cannot know, we cannot be"
825,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"sure that ""True Cretans"" were the pre-existing Aegeans. The Cydonians"
826,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,dwelt beside the Jardanus; Jardanus is also a river-name in Elis. Mr.
827,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Leaf thinks of the Semitic _yârad_, ""to flow"" (Jordan), but we have"
828,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"other such river-names, Yarrow, and the Australian Yarra Yarra; the"
829,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"word may be onomatopoeic, expressing the murmur of the water."
830,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
831,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Homer, in any case, does not despise the Asiatic allies of Troy as"
832,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"""barbarous,"" does not think them alien wholly, as the poets of the"
833,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"_Chansons de Geste_ regard the Saracens,--worshippers of Mahound and"
834,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,Apollon. The Asians have the same gods and rites as his own people;
835,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,Glaucus and Sarpedon are as good knights and live in precisely the same
836,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,sort of polity as Aias or Achilles. Homer does not think of the strife
837,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"as between Hellenes and Barbarians, that is a far later idea never"
838,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,interpolated into the Epics. All men are children of the Olympians.
839,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
840,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"It would appear that Homer sang before the northern invasion, usually"
841,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"called ""Dorian,"" caused the Achaean and Ionian migrations from the"
842,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Greek mainland, and the Greek settlements on the Asiatic coast (950-900"
843,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"B.C.?). He never alludes to these events, but it may be said that he"
844,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,deliberately conceals them.
845,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
846,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,The account which Homer gives of the Achaean heroes and their realms
847,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"is to be found in the Catalogue of the Ships in Book ii., a passage"
848,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"of three hundred lines. It is, perhaps, not very probable that this"
849,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"long list was usually recited at popular gatherings, and there is much"
850,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,dispute as to its date and purpose. We relegate to an appendix some
851,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"remarks on the debated questions. Whether the Catalogue, or most of"
852,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"it, was part of the original _Iliad_ or not, most of it was certainly"
853,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,composed at a time when the condition of prehistoric Greece was
854,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"well known, when a lively tradition of its divisions still existed;"
855,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"moreover, it is the work of a poet, and Milton deemed it worthy of"
856,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,imitation in _Paradise Lost_.
857,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
858,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"The Catalogue was omitted from many manuscripts of the _Iliad_,"
859,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,probably because it was thought tedious reading. But to us there is
860,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"poetry in the very names of ""rocky Aulis,"" and ""Mycalessus of the wide"
861,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"lawns,"" and ""dove-haunted Thisbe,"" and ""Lacedaemon lying low among"
862,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"the rifted hills."" The author wrote ""with his eye on the object,"""
863,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"and the doves of Thisbe have survived many empires and religions,"
864,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,still floating round their old domains and uttering their changeless
865,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"note.[9] ""Pleasant Titaresius"" still mingles his clear waters with the"
866,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"chalk-stained Peneius, and Celadon brawls as when Nestor heard its"
867,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,music.
868,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
869,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"The Catalogue enumerates all the Achaeans; Boeotians, Phocians,"
870,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Minyans; light-armed Locrian slingers; the Abantes of Euboea, fond of"
871,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"close combat; the Arcadians, whose dialect was nearest akin to Homer's"
872,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"own language, but who take no part in the action; the Epeians of Elis,"
873,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"once foes of Nestor's Pylians; the far-off Aetolians, no longer led"
874,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"by golden-haired Meleager; the Cretans of Cnossos, under Idomeneus,"
875,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"grandson of Minos; his neighbour Tlepolemos of Rhodes, of the blood of"
876,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Heracles, and probably a Dorian, though the Dorian name is not uttered;"
877,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"and some of the Sporades. There are, too, the south Thessalian Achaeans"
878,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"and Hellenes, the Myrmidons under Achilles; the men of Philoctetes,"
879,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,who lies sore hurt by a serpent's bite in the Isle of Lemnos; the
880,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,descendants in Thessaly (not a Homeric name) of the Lapithae; the
881,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Pethraebians from ""wintry Dodona""; the men of Argos and Tiryns of the"
882,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"mighty walls, under Diomede; the men of Lacedaemon under Menelaus; the"
883,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Athenians (much suspected of interpolating their own mention), Odysseus"
884,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,of the western and Aias of the eastern isles (Ithaca and Salamis); and
885,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"the host of Agamemnon, lord of Corinth, Sicyon, and Mycenae, himself"
886,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,the Over Lord of all.
887,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
888,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Taking the Catalogue as it stands, the princes of whom Agamemnon of"
889,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Mycenae was Over Lord come from the Greek mainland, from southern"
890,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Thessaly and Aetolia to the southernmost point of the Morea, and the"
891,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"islands as far south and east as Crete, Carpathos, and Rhodes."
892,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
893,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Now, as Agamemnon is the Over Lord, and Idomeneus of Cnossos in Crete"
894,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"is one of his thanes, so to speak, the poet clearly regards the Greek"
895,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"mainland as the centre of an Achaean dominion, of which Crete is a"
896,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,great dependency. He shows no idea that Crete had been the centre of
897,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"another power, and the focus of another civilisation, held by a people"
898,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"who, since the age of stone weapons and implements, had developed its"
899,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"culture without interruption, and had sent its arts to the mainland of"
900,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Greece. To Homer, Mycenae is the centre; the prince of Cnossos is a"
901,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,great feudatory of Agamemnon.
902,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
903,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,The poet is much interested in Crete; not only does the _Iliad_ dwell
904,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"on the prowess of Idomeneus the prince of Cnossos, and of Meriones;"
905,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"but in the feigned tales of Odysseus, when he returns to Ithaca, he"
906,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,represents himself as a Cretan adventurer. Homer avoids the Athenian
907,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"tales about Cretan tyranny, about the Minotaur, and the prowess"
908,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,of Theseus in aid of the freedom of Athens. These things are not
909,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"touched upon, as they certainly would have been had Athenians freely"
910,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,interpolated the poems. Homer entirely ignores all Athenian and Ionian
911,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,traditions.[10]
912,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
913,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,This is not the place to ask whether Achaeans from the mainland were
914,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,the men who took and sacked the palace of Cnossos in Crete about 1400
915,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"B.C., or whether the spoilers were ""Pelasgians,"" that is, people"
916,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"living on the mainland in Cretan conditions of culture, driven from"
917,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,the mainland by the Achaean irruption; or whether the palace was
918,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,wrecked during an internal revolution before the Achaeans came to the
919,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,island.[11] Homer undeniably regards Idomeneus as an Achaean and a
920,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,descendant of Minos; and Minos as a son of Zeus.[12] Rhadamanthus of
921,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"his blood, is ""the golden-haired,"" like Menelaus, Meleager, and some"
922,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"other heroes.[13] We are not here concerned with discrepant traditions,"
923,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,and with the idea that Minos is an Aegean as Pharaoh is an Egyptian
924,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,name of kings in general. That may be so; Minos may have been a figure
925,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"in Cretan legend before the Achaeans came thither; if so, they adopted"
926,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,him as their own. We are only stating Homer's view of the relations
927,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,between Crete and the Achaean power on the mainland.
928,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
929,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Homer's Catalogue of the Asian allies of Troy is brief, and contains"
930,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"only about sixty lines. There was a Trojan Catalogue in the _Cypria_,"
931,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"a lost Ionian epic poem of the eighth century, and as the Ionian"
932,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"colonists in Asia knew the country of their settlement well, it is"
933,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"likely to have been copious. Beginning, in Homer's Trojan Catalogue,"
934,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"with the Dardanians under Aeneas, who may be said to represent ""the"
935,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Orleans branch"" of the Trojan royal family, we next hear of the Trojans"
936,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"under Pandarus, who, in fact, broke the solemn oaths of truce, and"
937,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"sealed the doom of Ilium (_Iliad_, iv.), but who somehow as ""Sir"
938,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Pandarus of Troy"" acquired another kind of ill fame among our mediaeval"
939,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"poets. He dwelt by the Aesepus. ""At the extreme north of the Troad,"
940,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"where the Hellespont opens out into the Sea of Marmora,"" lived Adrastus"
941,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"and Amphius. Asius led forces from Sestus and Abydus, on both sides,"
942,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"European and Asian, of the Hellespont: there were also Pelasgians,"
943,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"apparently from the European side. There were, from Europe, Thracians"
944,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"and Cicones; the chief Thracian contingent arrived later (see _Iliad_,"
945,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Book x.). The Cicones, with whom Odysseus has trouble when first he"
946,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"leaves Troy, in the _Odyssey,_ are also European, as were probably,"
947,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"in origin, the people of Troy itself. European are the Paeonians,"
948,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"the Paphlagonians, again, are Asiatic; the Alizonians are remote"
949,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"and unrecognisable. Then we have Asiatic Mysians and Phrygians, and"
950,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Maeonians from near Sardis, and under Mount Tmolos inland. The Carians"
951,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"of Miletus (later an Ionian city) follow, the Meander is their river;"
952,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"last come the Lycians under Sarpedon (whom legend connects with Crete),"
953,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"and Glaucus; another Glaucus was son of Sisyphus of Ephyre (Corinth),"
954,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"in Argos, and was father of Bellerophon. Bellerophon, again, was sent"
955,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"to his death in Lycia, by Proetus, who had married a Lycian princess."
956,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,The Lycian Glaucus of the _Iliad_ is a grandson of Bellerophon
957,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"(_Iliad_, vi.)."
958,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
959,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"According to this story, Greeks freely passed to Lycia and intermarried"
960,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"with Lycians. Only the Carians are described as ""barbaric"" in language."
961,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Homer knows not, we said, the distinction of Hellenes and Barbarians;"
962,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,the Greeks did not know it till the struggle of their Asiatic colonies
963,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"against Lydia and Persia produced the sense of ""racial"" repulsion. In"
964,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Homer any Greek prince going to Asia is courteously treated, perhaps"
965,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"settles there like Bellerophon, or makes hereditary guest-friendships,"
966,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,like the ancestors of Glaucus and Diomede.
967,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
968,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,The distinction which Homer does know is that between god-fearing
969,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"men, with cities, laws, and rulers, on one hand, and men who are like"
970,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"the Cyclops, lonely, and lawless (_Od._ ix. 112-115). The Cyclops is"
971,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,not so godless as he boasts himself to be; he does pray to his father
972,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Poseidon, but he is wholly lawless, and each man is king in his own"
973,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"family. The cannibal Laestrygones, even, have a king and a city, though"
974,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"their manners are disgusting. Homer cannot easily, we see, conceive"
975,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,of men whose polity and cities are not like those with which he is
976,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,familiar. He may have heard vaguely of far northern tribes abiding by
977,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"their fiords in the land of amber, the land of the nightless summer"
978,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,and of the sunless winter. Such tales would come with the amber from
979,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"the Baltic coasts, for which merchants bartered the bronze swords and"
980,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"vessels of their own civilisation. He had certainly heard of ""the proud"
981,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Hippemolgoi,"" drinkers of mares' milk, nomad Scythians north of the"
982,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Danube, living like Tartars on koumiss.[14] If he has heard of any"
983,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"empire in the Asian _hinterland_, he may speak of it as one of the two"
984,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,Ethiopian realms; but here all is mythical.
985,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
986,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Egypt, too, appears in the tales of Odysseus when he represents himself"
987,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"as a Cretan adventurer, a raider in the lands by the river Aegyptus."
988,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Helen has been in Egypt, and received the drug _nepenthes_ from the"
989,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"wife of the king, just as she has been in Egyptian Thebes, and carried"
990,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,treasures thence (_Od_. iv. 130 ff.). Achilles[15] knows the wealth
991,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"of Egyptian Thebes, and its hundred gates, and countless charioteers."
992,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Sicily is known to the _Odyssey_, a poem of Ithaca and the west, and"
993,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"of ""perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn""; it is not mentioned in the"
994,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"_Iliad_, a poem of the east and the Asian shore. The Phoenicians are"
995,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"familiar as traders (_Iliad_, xxiii. 743), and are much better known,"
996,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"as is natural, to the sea-poem, the _Odyssey_. The appearance of the"
997,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"Phoenicians in the _Odyssey_, when they sell jewels to the women and"
998,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"kidnap the child Eumaeus, has been spoken of as work of the seventh"
999,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,century B.C.; a scene of contemporary life in that late age. But Mr.
1000,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"H. R. Hall, writing on early relations between Greece and Egypt, as"
1001,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"depicted in Egyptian wall-paintings of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty,"
1002,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,represents commerce between the Aegean peoples of Greece and Crete as
1003,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"filtering through ""Phoenician channels."" The Phoenicians were active"
1004,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"navigators and were merchants then and afterwards, that is, from the"
1005,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,sixteenth century B.C. onwards. A fresco in an Egyptian tomb of the
1006,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"early date shows the arrival of ""beaknosed"" Phoenicians ""in voluminous"
1007,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"and multi-coloured robes,"" one of them carrying ""a small Mycenaean"
1008,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"amphora,"" at the Theban quays.[16] This being so, it is not so easy"
1009,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,to bring down the Phoenicians of the _Odyssey_ to the seventh century
1010,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"B.C. The Sidonians make the goods which the Phoenicians transport, but"
1011,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,the Phoenician slave of the father of Eumaeus declares that she comes
1012,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"from the town of Sidon, and the Phoenician sailor knows her parents"
1013,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"(_Odyssey_, xv. 415-433). No very clear distinction seems to have been"
1014,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,drawn between Phoenicians and Sidonians.
1015,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
1016,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"These Semitic peoples were persistently credited, till lately, with all"
1017,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,the finer works of art and craft which Homer mentions. The discovery
1018,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,of the art of Minoan Crete has made this unqualified attribution
1019,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,impossible.[17] Certainly Homer conceives of the Semites as doing a
1020,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"large trade, and as kidnapping children in the Greek seas; but their"
1021,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"own art was imitative, and it is unlikely that, in Homer's time, the"
1022,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,characters of their alphabet had ousted those of Aegean civilisation.
1023,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,It is curious that the place in which Phoenicians exercised most
1024,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"influence, Cyprus, was also the place where the Phoenician alphabet"
1025,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"was so long in supplanting the native syllabary, akin to the unread"
1026,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,documents of Minoan Crete.
1027,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,
1028,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"We may thus conceive Homer's ancestors, by 1400 B.C., as men far from"
1029,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"savage or barbarian,[18] who then succeeded to an Aegean civilisation"
1030,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"much more luxurious and artistic than their own; and, centuries later,"
1031,HOMERIC LANDS AND PEOPLES,"when Homer sang, the glow of the Aegean culture still flushed the sky:"

1330,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,
1331,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,
1332,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,Though Homer describes a military aristocracy he is remarkable for his
1333,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"love of peace and hatred of war. His war-god, Ares, is a bully and a"
1334,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,coward; his home is Thrace; and he is never mentioned with sympathy.
1335,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,It seems to follow that Homer's people are conceived as long settled
1336,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"in tranquil homes; and, though Achilles says that ""cattle are to be"
1337,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"had for the raiding of them"" (_Iliad_, ix. 406), actual fighting to"
1338,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,recover captured cattle is thrown back into the youth of Nestor. Young
1339,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"adventurers, however, expend their energy, like the Icelanders of the"
1340,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"sagas, in ""going on viking,"" ""risking their own lives, bringing bane"
1341,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"to alien men."" The great war against Thebes is a memory of an earlier"
1342,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"generation; as are the combats with the wild and shaggy hill tribes,"
1343,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,and the war between Meleager and the Couretes. When war is in hand
1344,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,it has no more spirited singer than Homer; he has a special word (if
1345,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"correctly rendered) for ""the joy of battle"" ([Greek: charmê]), but it"
1346,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,has often been remarked that his men are not very resolute and stubborn
1347,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"fighters. They are not like the Spartans or the Macleans, with their"
1348,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,traditional rule of never retreating.
1349,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,
1350,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"War may be a duty, in the eyes of Homer, but it is not a pleasure;"
1351,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"and this is the more singular as, in early societies, the bard, who,"
1352,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"like Ian Lom,[1] does not fight himself, is fond of provoking men to"
1353,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"battle. Though Odysseus, in his feigned tales of himself as a Cretan"
1354,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"adventurer, speaks of piracy, and of raids on the coasts of Egypt,"
1355,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"and though casual homicides are lightly mentioned, the Homeric is a"
1356,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"peace-loving world. The wild justice of the blood-feud, after a fatal"
1357,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"blow struck in anger, exists, and, as a rule, the slayer goes into"
1358,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"exile, to some friendly prince, and thus avoids the feud of the dead"
1359,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,man's kin.
1360,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,
1361,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,On the Shield of Achilles was depicted a scene at the _Althing_
1362,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"(to use the Icelandic expression): ""The folk were gathered in the"
1363,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"assembly place; for there was a strife arisen, two men striving"
1364,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,about the blood-price of a man slain; the one claiming to pay full
1365,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"atonement, expounding to the people, but the other denied him, and"
1366,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"would take naught."" The people are taking sides, and shouting, the"
1367,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"heralds restrain them, the [Greek: gerontes] (the _probi homines_ or"
1368,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"_prud'hommes_) sit listening, on stone seats in the sacred circle.[2]"
1369,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"The public sense had enabled the slayer to remain at home, if the"
1370,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"kin of the dead would accept the blood-wyte, and allow the feud to"
1371,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"be pacified. As Aias says to Achilles, ""a man accepts recompense of"
1372,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"his brother's murderer, or for his dead son; and so the manslayer for"
1373,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"a great price abides in his own land....""[3] Probably it was usual"
1374,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"to accept the blood-price if a man had been slain openly, sword in"
1375,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"hand; but when a premeditated murder was committed, actual revenge was"
1376,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,desired. There was nothing reckoned mean or contemptible in the pacific
1377,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,arrangement: in heroic Iceland it was hard indeed to induce men to
1378,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,accept it.
1379,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,
1380,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"These are the manners of a settled people, who will bear much for"
1381,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"the sake of peace, and of a people free from superstitious dread of"
1382,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"the blood curse, and ignorant of the filthy rite of purification by"
1383,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"the blood of swine, which was a regular piece of ritual in historic"
1384,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"Hellas, and is familiar to Aeschylus,[4] the Ionian epic poets, and"
1385,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"to Apollonius Rhodius. Certainly the rite was unknown to Homer, who"
1386,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,mentions many homicides but says nothing of purification or of
1387,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,pollution. This point is later studied in detail. The life of the
1388,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"heroes in peace is the life of all early aristocracies who do not idle,"
1389,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"and do not intrigue in a Court. The women spin and embroider, like"
1390,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"Penelope and Helen, and keep their eyes on household affairs, and on"
1391,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"their poultry, mainly geese. Nausicaa sees to the washing of the linen."
1392,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"The men hunt hares and boars, and attend ""days of law"" in the legal"
1393,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"courts, and take part in funeral games. As yet we hear of no periodical"
1394,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"games, such as the Olympian, Isthmian, and Pythian, though the legends"
1395,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,of historic Greece pretend that these were founded in pre-Homeric times.
1396,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,
1397,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,The princes also looked well to their lands. Odysseus alone is
1398,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"mentioned as a skilled ploughman, carpenter, and shipwright, as some of"
1399,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"the Icelandic heroes are swordsmiths, but we see little of any prince"
1400,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"but Odysseus in peaceful life. There are professional artisans, whose"
1401,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"services are highly valued, carpenters, potters, bronze-smiths, and"
1402,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,weavers.
1403,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,
1404,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"The women meanwhile are amused by the visits of Phoenician pedlars, who"
1405,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"bring goods and gauds of every kind, and steal a child or carry away a"
1406,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"serving maid if they have the opportunity, as in the case of Eumaeus."
1407,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"After supper the minstrel of the prince chants lays, like Demodocus"
1408,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"in Phaeacia. As Spenser observed in Ireland, and as the Brehon laws"
1409,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"declare, the minstrel was highly honoured and trusted; the minstrel of"
1410,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"Agamemnon is charged, during the war, with the care of Clytemnestra."
1411,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"These poets did not accompany the host to the war, where Achilles"
1412,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"solaced himself by singing to the harp ""the renowns of men.""[5]"
1413,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,
1414,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"Such is the general picture of Homer's world in time of peace, as"
1415,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,far as the days and works of the princely class and the gentry are
1416,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"concerned. They are richly equipped with cups of gold, and furniture"
1417,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"inlaid with ivory and silver, even in the house of Odysseus. This"
1418,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,was but the dwelling of a king of a rocky isle. Entering the hall of
1419,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"Menelaus, Telemachus bids his companion, the son of Nestor, marvel at"
1420,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"the gleam of bronze, gold, electrum, silver, and ivory.[6] Apparently"
1421,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,the home of Nestor in Pylos was not so rich and lordly. The house of
1422,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,Menelaus is a picture of a dwelling rich in such treasures as have
1423,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,been found in the Royal graves of Mycenae and in the palace of Cnossos
1424,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"in Crete. In the house of Odysseus we hear of no bathroom and bath,"
1425,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,in which the girls of the house bathed princely guests and gave them
1426,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,change of raiment.[7] Weapons adorn the walls (in the house of Odysseus
1427,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"only), unless this be a later addition to the picture."
1428,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,
1429,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"In the Homeric hall, each guest had his own little table and his chair."
1430,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"The prince and his wife sat in the centre, beside the fire, under the"
1431,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,chief pillars. Honoured guests sat by them; the beggar was placed on
1432,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"the threshold, with his mess of meat. As in heroic Ireland, where the"
1433,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"rules were very minute, some portions of the flesh were more honourable"
1434,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"than others. In the lost _Thebais_, Oedipus curses his sons, Eteocles"
1435,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"and Polynices, because they send him, not the shoulder, but the haunch"
1436,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,([Greek: ischion])[8] This is a very archaic touch.
1437,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,
1438,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"Homer's world is aristocratic. The poet, none the less, has his eye"
1439,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,on the folk; on the honest poor woman who carefully weighs her wool;
1440,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,on the aged female thrall who is busy all night over her task of
1441,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"grain-grinding, and prays that the wooers who have broken her strength"
1442,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,may now eat their latest meal. He is keenly interested in the work of
1443,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"artisans, such as the currier and shield maker who wrought the great"
1444,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"shield of Aias; in the fisherman with his nets, or line and bait; in"
1445,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,the diver for oysters; in the woodmen with their axes; in sowing and
1446,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"ploughing, and the relative merits of oxen and mules as plough-beasts;"
1447,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,in the quarrel between two farmers over their boundary balk in the
1448,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"common field; in the lot of the hind of a landless man, the hardest lot"
1449,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"of any; in gold-workers and spinners; shepherds, hunts-men, herdsmen;"
1450,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"in the potter who ""sitting by his wheel maketh trial of it whether it"
1451,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"run""; in the virtues of a swineherd, a slave, who is noble by birth,"
1452,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,like Eumaeus; in all seafaring men down to the pursers and stewards;
1453,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"in the laughing girls that gather in the vintage, while a boy makes"
1454,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"sweet music, and sings the song of Linus with delicate voice; in the"
1455,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,ploughman who has a drink of wine at the end of the furrow; in the
1456,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"gardener with his orchard, the watering of a plot as it is done to this"
1457,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,day in the East; the fruit trees that Odysseus as a child was given
1458,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"""for his very own""; in the smith's warm forge where masterless tramps"
1459,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"sleep at night; in the beggar men with their wallets, who crouch on the"

1461,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,of the wooers; in the little girl that runs till she is weary by her
1462,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"mother's side, and catches at her skirt, praying to be taken up in her"

1473,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"It is plain from Homeric descriptions of palaces, and of works of"
1474,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"art, that his age had not lost touch with or memory of the Aegean"
1475,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,culture. Whether some great Aegean or Mycenaean palaces with friezes
1476,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"of cyanus (dark blue glass paste), and of metals, were still in a"
1477,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"habitable state, in Homer's days, or whether only the tradition"
1478,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"of their glory survived,--as memories of Roman buildings dwell in"
1479,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,the early Anglo-Saxon poem on the _Ruined City_ of the Romans in
1480,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"England,--it is clear that plenty of Aegean artistic work in gold"
1481,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"and other metals, cups and sword hilts, was preserved, and known to"
1482,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"the poet. The Achaeans did not invade merely to destroy, like the"
1483,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,Anglo-Saxon invaders of Romanised Britain. Far more civilised and
1484,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"refined than these rude hordes, they could appreciate and preserve as"
1485,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"well as burn and break,--in an hour of furious sack,--the treasures of"
1486,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,the more civilised race. But these treasures they could not imitate and
1487,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"reproduce, apparently (they are often spoken of as the work of the god"
1488,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"Hephaestus), and the ancient Aegean art waned and passed under new and"
1489,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,crude influences.
1490,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,
1491,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"Much as Homer delights in works of art, and vividly as he describes"
1492,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"them, and describes the toil of weavers, carpenters, shipwrights,"
1493,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"ploughmen, reapers, and vintagers, he never shows us a painter at"
1494,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"work on wall or vase, nor a mortal hand delineating, in any material,"
1495,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"men and women; except when Helen is weaving a great purple web, and"
1496,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"embroidering thereon, or interweaving there-with, ""many battles of"
1497,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"horse-taming Trojans and mail-clad Achaeans.""[9] This art implies some"
1498,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,knowledge of drawing and painting: from the Homeric age we have no
1499,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"relics of this art; but such webs might, like the Bayeux tapestry, last"
1500,HOMER'S WORLD IN PEACE,"long, and might be imitated, and it may have been from such old Aegean"

1531,MEN AND WOMEN,
1532,MEN AND WOMEN,
1533,MEN AND WOMEN,"In all modern times Homer has been admired for his noble, tender, and"
1534,MEN AND WOMEN,chivalrous sense of what is due to women; for his pictures of the
1535,MEN AND WOMEN,"perfect mother, Thetis; the perfect wife, Andromache; the perfect"
1536,MEN AND WOMEN,"maiden, frank, stainless, and kind, Nausicaa; for the woman of immortal"
1537,MEN AND WOMEN,"charm, Helen; while, when he does touch on the less lovable humours"
1538,MEN AND WOMEN,"of women,--on the nagging shrew, the light o' love, the rather bitter"
1539,MEN AND WOMEN,"virgin,--he selects his examples from the divine society of the Gods."
1540,MEN AND WOMEN,
1541,MEN AND WOMEN,It is an instance of the high and noble taste of the poet and his
1542,MEN AND WOMEN,"audience, that he dwells most on the best and most charming of the"
1543,MEN AND WOMEN,"women in old traditions, and is manifestly reluctant to tell of any"
1544,MEN AND WOMEN,"evil deed, or any cruel sorrow of a lady. Yet legend was full of women"
1545,MEN AND WOMEN,"fierce and revengeful as Brynhild; such women as Medea, who slew her"
1546,MEN AND WOMEN,"own children; Ino, who hated her step-children; Althaea, who, to avenge"
1547,MEN AND WOMEN,"her brothers, burned the brand that was the life-token of her son,"
1548,MEN AND WOMEN,"Meleager of the golden hair. There was hateful Eriphyle, bribed by the"
1549,MEN AND WOMEN,"gift that drew her lord to his doom; there was hapless Epicaste, wedded"
1550,MEN AND WOMEN,"to her son, the slayer of his father; there were unhappy Chloris, and"
1551,MEN AND WOMEN,"unhappy Tyro, mother of Pelias and Neleus by Poseidon, and victim of a"
1552,MEN AND WOMEN,"feminine revenge. But this part of the tale is Ionian or Athenian, not"
1553,MEN AND WOMEN,"Homeric. In Homer a woman is not dishonoured, but more highly esteemed,"
1554,MEN AND WOMEN,because she has been loved by a god. In Attic traditions she is
1555,MEN AND WOMEN,cruelly punished by her own kinsfolk.
1556,MEN AND WOMEN,
1557,MEN AND WOMEN,The wicked and ill-fated ladies who remind us of heroines in ancient
1558,MEN AND WOMEN,"German epos, are scarcely mentioned, or not at all in the _Iliad_"
1559,MEN AND WOMEN,"(where they could only appear in digressions), and the poet merely"
1560,MEN AND WOMEN,touches on their fortunes when Odysseus meets them in Hades. From the
1561,MEN AND WOMEN,"guilt and the misery of the ""far-renowned brides of ancient song,"""
1562,MEN AND WOMEN,"Homer averts his eyes. Even to Clytemnestra, though her sin cannot be"
1563,MEN AND WOMEN,"hidden, he allows the _bon naturel_ which Mary Stuart justly claimed"
1564,MEN AND WOMEN,for herself. We are reminded of the tenderness of Chaucer for the fault
1565,MEN AND WOMEN,"of Cressida, ""Ne me list this sely womman chyde."""
1566,MEN AND WOMEN,
1567,MEN AND WOMEN,"Homer himself never blames Helen, he regards her with the affection"
1568,MEN AND WOMEN,"and pity of Hector and Priam: it is the Trojan women and Penelope, her"
1569,MEN AND WOMEN,"cousin, who speak frankly of Helen and the ruin which she wrought. In"
1570,MEN AND WOMEN,"the _Iliad_ she does not, ""where'er she came, bring calamity""; she is"
1571,MEN AND WOMEN,"penitent, she longs for home, and her lord, and her one child, the"
1572,MEN AND WOMEN,"little maid Hermione. She scorns the cowardice of her lover, and, in"
1573,MEN AND WOMEN,"the third Book of the _Iliad_, the poet plainly declares that she is."
1574,MEN AND WOMEN,"the unwilling victim of Aphrodite. In the _Odyssey,_ wherever she"
1575,MEN AND WOMEN,"appears, she brings beauty, grace, charm, and quiet, and her appointed"
1576,MEN AND WOMEN,home is in the temperate meadows of the Elysian land.
1577,MEN AND WOMEN,
1578,MEN AND WOMEN,Homer does not dwell on the passion of love; he could not do so in
1579,MEN AND WOMEN,"an epic of war, and in an epic of a man seeking to win, on the sea,"
1580,MEN AND WOMEN,"""the return of his company."" But each epic turns on and is _motive_ by"
1581,MEN AND WOMEN,love; the _Iliad_ springs from the lawless love of Paris and Helen; the
1582,MEN AND WOMEN,_Odyssey_ from the wedded love of Odysseus and Penelope. The Wrath of
1583,MEN AND WOMEN,"Achilles, too, arises on account of his lost love. In the instance of"
1584,MEN AND WOMEN,"Paris, love has turned to the most tragic end: the passion of Helen is"
1585,MEN AND WOMEN,changed into bitter contempt and inconsolable regret.
1586,MEN AND WOMEN,
1587,MEN AND WOMEN,"The loves of youth and maiden, the whispered _oaristys_ ""from rock and"
1588,MEN AND WOMEN,"oak,"" are seldom the theme of Greek poetry; in the Epics they would be"
1589,MEN AND WOMEN,as out of place as in the _Chanson de Roland_. The loves of Troilus and
1590,MEN AND WOMEN,"Cressida were, to Chaucer, the central interest of the Trojan leaguer;"
1591,MEN AND WOMEN,no such place could they hold in Homer: he has an infinitely larger and
1592,MEN AND WOMEN,"nobler topic. Yet he who listens may hear ""The awakened loves around"
1593,MEN AND WOMEN,"him murmuring,"" in the lines that, through the din of battle, just"
1594,MEN AND WOMEN,"mention some old amour of gods with mortal maidens, of mortal men with"
1595,MEN AND WOMEN,fairies of the woods and hills.
1596,MEN AND WOMEN,
1597,MEN AND WOMEN,"Considering the warlike nature of the _Iliad_, the parts played by"
1598,MEN AND WOMEN,"women, by Helen, Andromache, Hecuba, and the touches that bring forward"
1599,MEN AND WOMEN,"the wifely tenderness of Theano, are almost surprising; while the whole"
1600,MEN AND WOMEN,"poem is dominated by the maternal love of Thetis, that magical figure"
1601,MEN AND WOMEN,"of sorrow, foreboding, and affection, without which the character of"
1602,MEN AND WOMEN,"Achilles would be jejune, and bereft of occasions to display its _fond_"
1603,MEN AND WOMEN,of tenderness and melancholy. Of course we are told that all these
1604,MEN AND WOMEN,"women are ""late,"" and formed no part of the original lay of the Wrath:"
1605,MEN AND WOMEN,that is to be expected of critical sagacity.
1606,MEN AND WOMEN,
1607,MEN AND WOMEN,"The magnificent passages on Helen, Andromache, and Hecuba; the humorous"
1608,MEN AND WOMEN,"descriptions of Hera; Athene, her divine father's darling, and of"
1609,MEN AND WOMEN,Aphrodite; the unnatural hatred of Althaea; the caprice of Anteia; the
1610,MEN AND WOMEN,"pathos of the dirges of Briseis for Patroclus, of Helen for Hector; the"
1611,MEN AND WOMEN,"remorseless jealousy of the mother of Phoenix, when his father loves"
1612,MEN AND WOMEN,"a mistress among her maids, all supply ""the female interest"" in the"
1613,MEN AND WOMEN,_Iliad_.
1614,MEN AND WOMEN,
1615,MEN AND WOMEN,"There is not so much ""female interest"" as in the _Volsunga Saga_, but"
1616,MEN AND WOMEN,"women occupy the same position, are regarded with the same deference;"
1617,MEN AND WOMEN,"they are free, on earth and in Olympus, they give their counsel and"
1618,MEN AND WOMEN,"even carry their point, as in the Icelandic sagas. In the _Odyssey_,"
1619,MEN AND WOMEN,"Arete and Nausicaa appear exactly in the fashion of Wealtheow,"
1620,MEN AND WOMEN,"Hrothgar's Queen, and her daughter in _Beowulf_,[1] they grace the"
1621,MEN AND WOMEN,company and still the quarrels of men.
1622,MEN AND WOMEN,
1623,MEN AND WOMEN,"The whole view of women is what we may call ""northern""; it is the"
1624,MEN AND WOMEN,"view of the sagas, of the English and the Teutonic epics; and is"
1625,MEN AND WOMEN,remote from the spirit of the partly orientalised poets of Ionia.
1626,MEN AND WOMEN,But for the bequest of ancient heroic tradition the poets of Athens
1627,MEN AND WOMEN,"could not have created their noble heroines. Attic life, Ionian life,"
1628,MEN AND WOMEN,could not produce such women; and Aeschylus and Sophocles fall back
1629,MEN AND WOMEN,"on memories of heroines who are not Ionian and are not Attic, in the"
1630,MEN AND WOMEN,"great majority of cases. Christian Europe at various times, in the age"
1631,MEN AND WOMEN,"of the chivalrous romances, and in comedy generally, fell far below"
1632,MEN AND WOMEN,"the old northern and Achaean view of the women's part. To chivalry,"
1633,MEN AND WOMEN,"adultery was a duty, to our European comedy it was a jest: marriage"
1634,MEN AND WOMEN,was a _bourgeois_ business. But even to historic Greece the sanctity
1635,MEN AND WOMEN,of the marriage-tie was a serious matter: adulterous intrigues are not
1636,MEN AND WOMEN,"the theme of Greek poets and comedians, as they have been ever since"
1637,MEN AND WOMEN,"our Middle Ages. Lancelot, and still more Tristram, would have been"
1638,MEN AND WOMEN,stigmatised as Paris is by Hector; and Guinevere and Iseult would have
1639,MEN AND WOMEN,"heard more reproaches from their own sex, than Penelope and the Trojan"
1640,MEN AND WOMEN,"women bestow on Helen. The Gods are a sinful and adulterous generation,"
1641,MEN AND WOMEN,in the mythical view; but in the religious view they warn Aegisthus
1642,MEN AND WOMEN,against his sin and its consequence.[2]
1643,MEN AND WOMEN,
1644,MEN AND WOMEN,"Turning to the legal position of women, we do not know much about"
1645,MEN AND WOMEN,"the civil penalty or fine for adultery ([Greek: moichagria]), but"
1646,MEN AND WOMEN,"Menelaus, the soul of honour, is eager to avenge himself in the duel."
1647,MEN AND WOMEN,The fine for adultery may have been the equivalent of the bride-price
1648,MEN AND WOMEN,"paid by the bridegroom. Hephaestus, in the song of Demodocus,"
1649,MEN AND WOMEN,demands the return of the bride-price which he gave for the faithless
1650,MEN AND WOMEN,"Aphrodite, the [Greek: eedna].[3] The bride-price, often mentioned,"
1651,MEN AND WOMEN,"is a well-known institution, obsolete in historic Greece but familiar"
1652,MEN AND WOMEN,"to the poet. In very rare cases in Homer, a man may receive a bride"
1653,MEN AND WOMEN,without paying a price for doing some great public service: in some
1654,MEN AND WOMEN,circumstances the father will even give a dowry with the bride.[4] In
1655,MEN AND WOMEN,the most notable passage where dowry ([Greek: meilia]) is mentioned by
1656,MEN AND WOMEN,"the poet, he plainly shows his knowledge that the giving of dowry is"
1657,MEN AND WOMEN,an exception to the general rule; for he mentions the rule--the wooer
1658,MEN AND WOMEN,"pays the bride-price [Greek: eedna], but in his sore need of Achilles,"
1659,MEN AND WOMEN,"Agamemnon offers his daughter ""without price"" ([Greek: anaednon]), and"
1660,MEN AND WOMEN,_plus_ such gifts as no man ever endowed his daughter with.[5] This is
1661,MEN AND WOMEN,no proof that the poet of Book ix. lived in a later age than that of
1662,MEN AND WOMEN,"the bride-price. He merely recognises what, in an age of bride-price,"
1663,MEN AND WOMEN,"must have been the fact, that in unusual circumstances, when the"
1664,MEN AND WOMEN,"alliance of a man was of crucial importance to the father, he would"
1665,MEN AND WOMEN,buy instead of selling his daughter's marriage. People were never such
1666,MEN AND WOMEN,"pedants as not to infringe a custom, not sacred but a secular bargain,"
1667,MEN AND WOMEN,when strong need came on them.
1668,MEN AND WOMEN,
1669,MEN AND WOMEN,"In another instance the husband was King Priam, whose alliance was"
1670,MEN AND WOMEN,"worth buying by the aged father of the bride. ""Circumstances alter"
1671,MEN AND WOMEN,"cases,"" as critics often forget, and such rare divergences from the"
1672,MEN AND WOMEN,usual rule are not proofs of late interpolation. The Icelanders gave
1673,MEN AND WOMEN,"dowries with their daughters, but when Njal was especially eager for a"
1674,MEN AND WOMEN,"bride for his foster son, he offered to reverse the process and give"
1675,MEN AND WOMEN,"[Greek: eedna], bride-price.[6] In the case of the marriage of Penelope"
1676,MEN AND WOMEN,"(a very peculiar instance, as there was no proof that she was a widow,"
1677,MEN AND WOMEN,"and as it is not easy to see who ""had her marriage""), we hear of"
1678,MEN AND WOMEN,"bride-price ""such as is meet to go with a dear daughter."" This return"
1679,MEN AND WOMEN,"of the price, or of part of it, was familiar to the Laws of Hammurabi"
1680,MEN AND WOMEN,"and of the Germans of Tacitus.[7] We may, with the separatist critics,"
1681,MEN AND WOMEN,suppose that the passages about returning the bride-price of Penelope
1682,MEN AND WOMEN,"when she goes to her second husband,[8] belong to a later period than"
1683,MEN AND WOMEN,"the body of the Epics; or, more probably, that a variety of customs may"
1684,MEN AND WOMEN,"coexist (that they may we have proved), and, in any case, Penelope's"
1685,MEN AND WOMEN,"people were anxious to get her off their hands in one way or another,"
1686,MEN AND WOMEN,her situation being irksome and anomalous. Rare must be the examples
1687,MEN AND WOMEN,"of interpolated details, when a case so anomalous as that of Penelope"
1688,MEN AND WOMEN,is seized on as proof of the presence of later social practices. The
1689,MEN AND WOMEN,"passages about Penelope are peculiar. In _Od_. ii. 53, Telemachus says"
1690,MEN AND WOMEN,"that the wooers have no mind to go to the father of Penelope, who"
1691,MEN AND WOMEN,"[Greek: autos eednoosaito thygatra]. If we take this to mean ""will"
1692,MEN AND WOMEN,"endow her,"" the writer does not know the meaning of [Greek: eedna];"
1693,MEN AND WOMEN,"but I conceive him to say, ""will fix the bride-price,"" or make the"
1694,MEN AND WOMEN,"terms.[9] Compare _Iliad_, xiii. 384, [Greek: epei ou toi eednootai"
1695,MEN AND WOMEN,"kakoi eimen], ""we will not make hard marriage terms,"" that is, will not"
1696,MEN AND WOMEN,demand a heavy bride-price.
1697,MEN AND WOMEN,
1698,MEN AND WOMEN,"In _Od_. i. 278, ii. 196, Telemachus is bidden to take his mother to"
1699,MEN AND WOMEN,"her father, ""they will give the marriage feast and [Greek: artuneousin"
1700,MEN AND WOMEN,"eedna], many such as should follow with a dear daughter."" Mr. Murray"
1701,MEN AND WOMEN,"says that the writer of these lines ""mistook the meaning of estim"
1702,MEN AND WOMEN,"because he had forgotten the custom"" (_R. G. E._ p. 152). But even"
1703,MEN AND WOMEN,Aeschylus knew that [Greek: eedna] were gifts from the bridegroom
1704,MEN AND WOMEN,"(_Prometheus_, 559, quoted by Mr. Murray); and if the author of the"
1705,MEN AND WOMEN,"passages in _Odyssey_, i. ii., did not know, he cannot have read the"
1706,MEN AND WOMEN,"_Iliad_ and _Odyssey_. This is so improbable, for even the author of"
1707,MEN AND WOMEN,"the very ""late"" song of Ares and Aphrodite (_Od_. viii. 318) knew all"
1708,MEN AND WOMEN,"about the legal nature of [Greek: eedna], that we can hardly suppose"
1709,MEN AND WOMEN,the writer of the passages in _Od._ i. ii. to have fancied that [Greek:
1710,MEN AND WOMEN,"eedna] meant ""dowry."""
1711,MEN AND WOMEN,
1712,MEN AND WOMEN,"One thing is certain, that the prehistoric usage of bride-price almost"
1713,MEN AND WOMEN,"uniformly prevails in the poems, with a trace of such variations in"
1714,MEN AND WOMEN,"custom as actually occur, when circumstances or affection demand it, in"
1715,MEN AND WOMEN,every stage of human society. The bridal customs are not pedantically
1716,MEN AND WOMEN,"stereotyped in Homer, but variations in accordance with circumstances"
1717,MEN AND WOMEN,"do not prove lateness or earliness, any more than such female names"
1718,MEN AND WOMEN,"as Alphesiboea, Phereboea, Polyboea, and others, indicating that a"
1719,MEN AND WOMEN,"daughter, on her marriage, will bring many kine into her family,"
1720,MEN AND WOMEN,"""express the excuse which the parents made to themselves for venturing"
1721,MEN AND WOMEN,"to rear the useless female child.""[10]"
1722,MEN AND WOMEN,
1723,MEN AND WOMEN,Not even in Australian black society are girls more apt than male
1724,MEN AND WOMEN,"babies to be killed as _bouches inutiles_, they are far too valuable"
1725,MEN AND WOMEN,"to their brothers or maternal uncles, being exchanged for other men's"
1726,MEN AND WOMEN,sisters or nieces as brides. The cattle-owning barbaric societies of
1727,MEN AND WOMEN,"Africa are not addicted to female infanticide, much less could Homeric"
1728,MEN AND WOMEN,society be with its wealth and its tenderness of heart. In Greek
1729,MEN AND WOMEN,non-Homeric legend how often do we hear of a baby-girl being exposed?
1730,MEN AND WOMEN,"It is the boys who suffer, in the hope of defeating some prophecy."
1731,MEN AND WOMEN,Homeric society is infinitely remote from that in which girls were too
1732,MEN AND WOMEN,expensive and useless to keep.[11]
1733,MEN AND WOMEN,
1734,MEN AND WOMEN,Homer is the last author in whom we can hopefully look for survivals of
1735,MEN AND WOMEN,"savagery, or of cruel and filthy superstitions. In the Epics there is"
1736,MEN AND WOMEN,"not a harlot, common as they are in the ancient Hebrew books. It is not"
1737,MEN AND WOMEN,"to be supposed that the ancient profession was unknown, but all such"
1738,MEN AND WOMEN,things are ignored in deference to a taste more pure than that of early
1739,MEN AND WOMEN,Ionian society and of historic Greece from first to last. The tone of
1740,MEN AND WOMEN,"taste and morals is, in short, Achaean, like the poet himself;[12]"
1741,MEN AND WOMEN,"Shakespeare, in _Troilus and Cressida_, makes Patroclus mimic Nestor; he"

1747,MEN AND WOMEN,"in ""a night-alarm."" Shakespeare has read of the night-alarm in _Iliad_,"
1748,MEN AND WOMEN,"Book x., but not there did he find, nowhere in Homer could he find ""the"
1749,MEN AND WOMEN,"faint defects of age"" made matter of merriment. In Homer nobody coughs!"
1750,MEN AND WOMEN,
1751,MEN AND WOMEN,The Homeric idea of the family is symbolised in the wedding bed which
1752,MEN AND WOMEN,"Odysseus fashioned with his own hands, making it fast to the trunk of"
1753,MEN AND WOMEN,a living tree that it might never be moved.[13] and adorning it with
1754,MEN AND WOMEN,"inlay of gold, silver and ivory. According to many critics, of whom"
1755,MEN AND WOMEN,"Wolf is the earliest, the final books of the _Odyssey_ are later than"
1756,MEN AND WOMEN,"the rest, and the idea of a separate chamber for husband and wife is"
1757,MEN AND WOMEN,"late. Other critics, when they find mentions of such a separate chamber"
1758,MEN AND WOMEN,"([Greek: dalamos]) in other parts of the Epic, explain them as late"
1759,MEN AND WOMEN,interpolations. They appear once again to forget that in no civilised
1760,MEN AND WOMEN,society is there absolute uniformity of detail in all the arrangements
1761,MEN AND WOMEN,of domestic life. An interesting example may be found in Scott's
1762,MEN AND WOMEN,"description of the hall and house of Cedric the Saxon,--the hall"
1763,MEN AND WOMEN,"floored with ""earth mixed with lime, trodden into a hard substance,"
1764,MEN AND WOMEN,"such as is often employed in flooring our modern barns,"" the rafters"

1775,MEN AND WOMEN,
1776,MEN AND WOMEN,"On this showing, Odysseus had chosen to adopt a different arrangement,"
1777,MEN AND WOMEN,it does not quite follow that the account of his house is late;
1778,MEN AND WOMEN,it would be hard to prove that _thalamos_ (chamber) and _megaron_
1779,MEN AND WOMEN,"(hall) are identical, we hear of no outside _thalamos_, like that of"

1783,MEN AND WOMEN,
1784,MEN AND WOMEN,The happiness of wedded life has never been more nobly praised than
1785,MEN AND WOMEN,by Homer in the famous speech of Odysseus to Alcinous. Adultery is
1786,MEN AND WOMEN,"laughed at only among the gods. Moreover, we never hear of lightness"
1787,MEN AND WOMEN,"of behaviour in girls, except when a God is the wooer, and that is"
1788,MEN AND WOMEN,"reckoned an honour, the woman is sought for in marriage by mortals."
1789,MEN AND WOMEN,"In Ionian tradition, as has been said, on the other hand, the girls"
1790,MEN AND WOMEN,"beloved by gods are severely punished, like Tyro."
1791,MEN AND WOMEN,
1792,MEN AND WOMEN,"Fidelity is not expected from men when absent at a long siege, or lost"
1793,MEN AND WOMEN,"in unknown lands, like Odysseus, who does not scruple to tell Penelope"
1794,MEN AND WOMEN,about Circe and Calypso. At home the fidelity of husbands depends on
1795,MEN AND WOMEN,"the characters of the pair. Laertes is fond of a fair handmaid, but"
1796,MEN AND WOMEN,"dreads the wrath of his wife, as the father of Phoenix, in a similar"
1797,MEN AND WOMEN,"case, found that _he_ had good reason to do. The bastards of whom we"
1798,MEN AND WOMEN,"hear are probably sons of the captives of the spear, brought home as"
1799,MEN AND WOMEN,"Agamemnon unadvisedly brought Cassandra. Theano, wife of Antenor,"
1800,MEN AND WOMEN,"""nurtured his bastard, like her own children, to do her husband"
1801,MEN AND WOMEN,"pleasure.""[16] Teucer also, a bastard, was brought up by his father"
1802,MEN AND WOMEN,"in his own house.[17] There was one law for the men, another for the"
1803,MEN AND WOMEN,"women, and Dr. Johnson approved of this moral system in England."
1804,MEN AND WOMEN,
1805,MEN AND WOMEN,The domestic relations are very pleasingly portrayed in the _Iliad_.
1806,MEN AND WOMEN,"Homer, to be sure, knows that family life is not always monotonously"
1807,MEN AND WOMEN,peaceful and affectionate. In the long speech of Phoenix (Book ix.)
1808,MEN AND WOMEN,"we see a son, Meleager, who has a feud with his maternal uncles and"
1809,MEN AND WOMEN,"is under his mother's curse. This family feud, in which the wife and"
1810,MEN AND WOMEN,"mother takes sides with her own kin against her husband or sons, is a"
1811,MEN AND WOMEN,"common motive in the oldest Teutonic Epics, and even in the historic"
1812,MEN AND WOMEN,traditions of the Camerons.
1813,MEN AND WOMEN,
1814,MEN AND WOMEN,"But it is among the Olympians that Homer finds his blustering, teasing"
1815,MEN AND WOMEN,"yet placable husband and father, Zeus; his shrewish wife, Hera; his"
1816,MEN AND WOMEN,"rather spiteful daughter, Athene; and his lady of pleasure, Aphrodite,"
1817,MEN AND WOMEN,"whose intrigues are a jest. The affection of Zeus for his daughter,"
1818,MEN AND WOMEN,"none the less, is happily displayed, while among men the fraternal"
1819,MEN AND WOMEN,affection of Agamemnon for Menelaus is his most agreeable trait.
1820,MEN AND WOMEN,"Parents and children, except in the woeful adventure of Phoenix, are"
1821,MEN AND WOMEN,"always on the best of terms, as in the households of Odysseus, Nestor,"
1822,MEN AND WOMEN,"and Alcinous; and the petulance of Priam towards his sons, after the"
1823,MEN AND WOMEN,"death of Hector, is excused by his age and intolerable sufferings."

1890,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"On the fringe of the horizon, in Homer's day as in our own, always hung"
1891,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"the cloud of war. In war, men were as cruel as they have usually been."
1892,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"A successful siege of a city involved the slaying of its defenders, and"
1893,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"the carrying away of the women, ""to make another's bed, and draw water"
1894,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"from another's well."" Hector, when the broken oaths of the duel[1] make"
1895,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"it certain that Troy must perish, looks for no better fortune to befall"
1896,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,Andromache; may the earth be mounded above him before that day!
1897,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,
1898,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"Though a truce is granted for the cremation and burial, with one common"
1899,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"cairn, of the men who fall in a great battle,[2] it is not Achilles"
1900,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"alone who would fain refuse burial, and rest in the House of Hades,"
1901,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,to an enemy. Hector intends to give the body of Patroclus to the dogs
1902,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"of Troy, and to fix his head on the palisade above the wall.[3] The"
1903,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"fury of Achilles, when he learns from Iris the intentions of Hector,"
1904,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,has thus more excuse than is usually supposed. Homer himself found
1905,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"such deeds in the tradition; and though he regards them with horror,"
1906,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,he cannot expurgate them. The insults lavished by Achilles on the dead
1907,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"Hector are [Greek: aeikea erga], deeds of shame.[4] But the deeds of"
1908,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,Hector would have been as shameful. The treatment of Hector was not
1909,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,sensational enough for the refined taste of the Athenian tragedians.
1910,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,Sophocles and Euripides make Achilles drag the wounded but living
1911,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,Hector.[5]
1912,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,
1913,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,The tragedians here followed a tradition that was not Homer's; it
1914,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"may have come, Mr. Murray suggests, from the lost Cyclic poem _Iliou"
1915,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"Persis_, the _Sack of Ilios_. The Cyclic poets of 750-650 B.C. are in"
1916,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,all ways more superstitious and barbarous than Homer; theirs is the
1917,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"taste of a later age than his, and, as we shall see, they are usually"
1918,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"followed by the Athenian tragedians. They preferred the ""sensational"""
1919,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"and the ""harrowing,"" and did not shrink, in the _Andromache_, as in"
1920,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"the Ionian _Sack of Ilios_, from the brutal murder of Hector's child,"
1921,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,Astyanax. Homer's men are never child-murderers. City sackings were
1922,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"as cruel as those of Cromwell in Ireland, of Monk in Dundee; our own"
1923,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"dealings with Badajoz and Ciudad Rodrigo are more recent examples,"
1924,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"and these were towns of our allies. But Homer's men do not, like the"
1925,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"Assyrians, torture prisoners of war; such captives were starved,"
1926,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"tortured, and literally caged, to extract ransom, during our Hundred"
1927,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"Years' War with France; as Cromwell's prisoners, after Dunbar, were"
1928,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"starved in Durham Cathedral. In Homer, ransom is sometimes accepted,"
1929,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"in the earlier days of the siege. Achilles, especially, took ransoms"
1930,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"and was merciful. Contrast the ferocity of Agamemnon, who refuses"
1931,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"quarter, and slays a man to whom Menelaus was giving quarter.[6]"
1932,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"Agamemnon actually cuts off the hands and head of one foe, and throws"
1933,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,the head into the throng! He desires that not even the male child
1934,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"in the womb may escape! (_Iliad_, vi. 56-60). There are chivalrous"
1935,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"passages, as when Hector and Aias exchange gifts after an indecisive"
1936,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"passage of arms, and when Diomede and Glaucus recognise their ancestral"
1937,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,friendship; but there are plenty of cases in which victors exult with
1938,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"cruel humour over their fallen foes, in the spirit of Arthur in"
1939,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,Layamon's _Brut_. (1200 A.D.).
1940,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,
1941,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"The dead, except in the case of Eetion on whom Achilles had ruth, were"
1942,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"always stripped of arms and armour, if the victors were not impeded."
1943,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,The hut of Idomeneus held many such Trojan spoils. There are hints
1944,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"of a custom of tearing the tunics, or chitons,[7] but they are vague"
1945,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"and unimportant. No doubt the act, when performed, was intended as"
1946,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"an insult, but it is only alluded to twice or thrice: in one case"
1947,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"the tunic is ""of bronze,"" answering to the current term [Greek:"
1948,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"_chalkochitoones_], ""bronze-clad.""[8] The case is obscure."
1949,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,
1950,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,_A la guerre comme à la guerre_. The morals of war in Homer are not
1951,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"unlike those of war everywhere in the matter of ""atrocities."" The siege"
1952,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,operations were very inefficient. The Achaeans were not able to invest
1953,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"Troy, and they never dreamed of an escalade. Without a scaling-ladder"
1954,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"Patroclus ""thrice clomb on the corner of the lofty wall,"" and was only"
1955,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,thrust back by Apollo.[9] But scaling-ladders are never mentioned; a
1956,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,night attack is never contemplated. The famous Wooden Horse is the
1957,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,only hint of an approach under a wooden cover on wheels (the mediaeval
1958,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"""Sow""); and if it was anything of that sort, Homer did not understand"
1959,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,its nature. The efficient fighting in the open was done by chariotry
1960,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,(the owners usually dismounted and fought in line or column); as in
1961,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"most ancient oriental countries, Scotland in Roman times, and Ireland"
1962,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"in the Late Celtic period, perhaps as late as 300 a.d., also in early"
1963,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,Britain. By the date of the Black Figure vases (sixth century B.C.)
1964,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"and in seventh century art, the painters often introduce mounted men:"
1965,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"the ""late poets"" abstained from doing so, it appears, except the late"
1966,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"unspeakable _Stümper_ of the Doloneia, according to Reichel."
1967,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,
1968,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"The tactics, as far as we can make a coherent picture of them, were"
1969,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"peculiar, but not unexampled."
1970,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,
1971,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,At the beginning of a pitched battle the knights (owners of chariots)
1972,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"dismounted, and formed a thick and serried line of infantry: behind"
1973,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"them came the nameless host, concerning whose armour we have no"
1974,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,information. The light-armed archers and slingers showered their
1975,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"missiles, and the combat might last for hours. At ""the break of the"
1976,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"battle,"" when one side had broken the enemy's line, the victors pursued"
1977,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"either on foot, or, more generally, in their chariots which had been"
1978,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,stationed behind them in the close combat; while the vanquished leaped
1979,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"into their chariots and fled, save the brave who retired face to the"
1980,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"foe. After the break in the battle, the individual exploits of the"
1981,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"mounted knights, the chariotry, fill the picture, till the beaten"
1982,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"forces reach the wall of the Greek camp, or of Troy, when a rally"
1983,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"occurs, followed by another battle in ordered ranks.[10]"
1984,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,
1985,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"As to the armour and weapons, Homer represents every man-at-arms as"
1986,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"wearing a helmet, usually of bronze; and a huge shield, very long, like"
1987,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,the three sorts of shield represented in Aegean art on the Mycenaean
1988,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,dagger blade showing lion hunters. Some shields in this art are in
1989,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"form like the figure 8, they belly out, and protect a man from neck to"
1990,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"ankles. Others are merely doors, flat and oblong, of the same size;"
1991,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"others are equally large, cylindrical, and partly protect the sides."
1992,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"All are hung from the shoulder by baldrics, not held in the hand,"
1993,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,like the parrying bucklers of the eighth century and later. Homer thus
1994,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"describes such huge shields as these of Aegean art, with baldrics; but"
1995,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,his language not infrequently conveys the impression that some shields
1996,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"are circular; indeed, it is only by wrenching the sense of the Greek"
1997,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,that any other meaning can be obtained. The details are considered
1998,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,later; meanwhile Homer's shields are neither those of the Dipylon
1999,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"period nor of archaic Greek art, and in their size and their baldrics"
2000,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,correspond to those of Aegean representations. The substance of the
2001,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"shields is layers of ox's hide, covered with a plating of bronze."
2002,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"Warriors also wear corslet, metal girdle, and metal-plated kirtle: the"
2003,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"corslet was thin, and could be pierced by arrows. The greaves to cover"
2004,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"the shins were probably of bronze, laced up with wire, as in a pair"
2005,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"from Enkomi in Cyprus, of the Age of Bronze, now in the British Museum."
2006,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"No thigh pieces are mentioned, though they are commonly shown in the"
2007,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,art of the seventh to sixth centuries.[11]
2008,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,
2009,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,For offensive weapons the men-at-arms use two spears with heavy heads
2010,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"of bronze, these are usually thrown; and a sword of bronze, commonly"
2011,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,a heavy cut and thrust blade (never the long Elizabethan rapier of an
2012,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"earlier Minoan time), with a handle of ivory, inlaid or studded with"
2013,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"gold or silver, in some cases. The sheath is similarly decorated. Only"
2014,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"once do we hear of a battle-axe of bronze; and the dirk, sometimes of"
2015,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"iron, is never said to be used in battle. These weapons have analogues"
2016,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,in certain swords and daggers found in Aegean graves.
2017,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,
2018,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"Archery is not so highly considered as when ""the man Heracles"" and"
2019,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"the great Eurytus were bowmen. Odysseus, the heir of the mighty bow"
2020,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"of Eurytus, left it at home, and fought as a heavy-armed footman."
2021,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"Pandarus, on the other hand, left his horses and chariots at home, and"
2022,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"came to Troy trusting in his bow.[12] Teucer, Pandarus, Paris, and"
2023,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"occasionally Meriones, are the bowmen, among the princes, and Paris"
2024,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,and Pandarus are taunted for their weak and cowardly missiles; honour
2025,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"was to be won with sword and spear. The Scots archers, in the same"
2026,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"way, were always anxious to come to hand-strokes with their sperths,"
2027,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"or battle-axes; the Highlanders threw down their muskets, after one"
2028,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"discharge, and went in with the claymore; the French never reconciled"
2029,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,themselves to the long bow; the Spartans despised it. This was the
2030,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,Homeric sentiment: the bow was scarcely the weapon for a hero. The
2031,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,arrow-heads were of bronze.[13] In Mycenaean graves at Kakovotos (Old
2032,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"Pylos) in Elis, the stone arrow points are of very fine neolithic"
2033,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"work.[14] When archery declined yet lower, in historic times, the"
2034,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"round or oval parrying buckler, carried on the left arm, came in, as a"
2035,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,protection against spears and sword-strokes. This parrying buckler does
2036,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,not appear in Homer: efforts made to discover it are unsuccessful.
2037,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,
2038,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,Thus Homer describes a given stage in the art of war: his pictures are
2039,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,"not patchworks of ""Mycenaean"" fighting (about which we know nothing),"
2040,THE HOMERIC WORLD IN WAR,and of civic Greek fighting in the age of civic heavy-armed foot.

2090,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2091,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2092,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Homer is not a scientific military historian, but a poet. Consequently,"
2093,HOMERIC TACTICS,"in his accounts of pitched battles, he naturally dwells on the prowess"
2094,HOMERIC TACTICS,of famous individuals in the single combat; the struggle of one hero
2095,HOMERIC TACTICS,against a group of assailants; the pursuit and the flight; more than he
2096,HOMERIC TACTICS,"dwells on the long encounter of marshalled lines before ""the break in"
2097,HOMERIC TACTICS,"the battle."""
2098,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2099,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Let us consider the battle in _Iliad_, xi. The princes begin by giving"
2100,HOMERIC TACTICS,"their chariots to the charioteers, ""to hold them in by the fosse, well"
2101,HOMERIC TACTICS,"and orderly,"" and ""themselves as heavy men-at-arms were hastening"
2102,HOMERIC TACTICS,"about.""[1] They are then marshalled in order, with the chariots behind"
2103,HOMERIC TACTICS,"them. Meanwhile Hector arrays the Trojans, being now with the front"
2104,HOMERIC TACTICS,"and now with the rear ranks.[2] The fight begins; ""equal heads had the"
2105,HOMERIC TACTICS,"battle."" The two forces meet like two bands of reapers shearing the"
2106,HOMERIC TACTICS,"corn of a field from either limit, and meeting in the centre.[3] This"
2107,HOMERIC TACTICS,steady fight of lines of dismounted men-at-arms endures from dawn to
2108,HOMERIC TACTICS,"midday, till, at noon, comes ""the break in the battle,"" ""the Danaans"
2109,HOMERIC TACTICS,"by their valour brake the battalions.""[4] Agamemnon, on foot, rushes"
2110,HOMERIC TACTICS,"into the ruined ranks of Troy, and slays many Trojans in their chariots"
2111,HOMERIC TACTICS,(which they would naturally mount for the sake of speedier flight);
2112,HOMERIC TACTICS,"there is a pursuit of the broken foe, ""footmen kept slaying footmen"
2113,HOMERIC TACTICS,"as they were driven in flight, and horsemen slaying horsemen with"
2114,HOMERIC TACTICS,"the sword""; till the flying Trojans rally at the Scaean gate, while"
2115,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Agamemnon still slays the hindmost fugitives. A flesh-wound irks him,"
2116,HOMERIC TACTICS,"and he ""retires hurt."" Hector, by command of Zeus, has waited for this"
2117,HOMERIC TACTICS,"moment, and now leads a chariot-charge among the scattered Achaeans."
2118,HOMERIC TACTICS,Henceforth there is a series of individual encounters; Odysseus is
2119,HOMERIC TACTICS,"alone and is surrounded; he fights hard; he calls for aid, and is"
2120,HOMERIC TACTICS,"rescued by Menelaus and Aias. Several Achaean princes are wounded,"
2121,HOMERIC TACTICS,"among others Diomede, Agamemnon, and Odysseus retire to their quarters"
2122,HOMERIC TACTICS,for rest and surgical aid.
2123,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2124,HOMERIC TACTICS,"This is not scientific fighting: no general is apart, receiving news"
2125,HOMERIC TACTICS,"of the fight, sending supports where they are needed, husbanding the"
2126,HOMERIC TACTICS,"reserves, and so forth. The leaders actually _lead_, and their men are"
2127,HOMERIC TACTICS,"discouraged and give ground when the chiefs are put out of action,"
2128,HOMERIC TACTICS,precisely as in the Highland armies of clans under Dundee or Montrose
2129,HOMERIC TACTICS,"or Prince Charles, where so much depended on the success of the first"
2130,HOMERIC TACTICS,onslaught. Homer's men have more faculty for recovering from a severe
2131,HOMERIC TACTICS,"stroke. The Achaeans, after a long struggle of heavy dismounted"
2132,HOMERIC TACTICS,"men-at-arms, drive the Trojans to the city wall. The Trojans rally,"
2133,HOMERIC TACTICS,"and drive the Achaeans to their own fortifications, where there is a"
2134,HOMERIC TACTICS,confused mellay at the fosse and under the wall.[5]
2135,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2136,HOMERIC TACTICS,Polydamas very properly now advises the chivalry of Troy to dismount
2137,HOMERIC TACTICS,"and fight on foot ([Greek: _prylees_]) in dense columns, while their"
2138,HOMERIC TACTICS,"chariots are held stationary by their squires. Hector approves, and"
2139,HOMERIC TACTICS,the dismounted Trojans form five columns of attack on a fortified
2140,HOMERIC TACTICS,"position.[6] The Achaeans, scattered and disheartened, are mainly led"
2141,HOMERIC TACTICS,"and helped by the two Aiantes, but Poseidon rallies five or six young"
2142,HOMERIC TACTICS,"heroes of Boeotia, Aetolia, Crete, and Pylos.[7] They are confessedly"
2143,HOMERIC TACTICS,both wearied and demoralised by the success of Hector in breaking down
2144,HOMERIC TACTICS,the gate.[8] They are actually weeping!
2145,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2146,HOMERIC TACTICS,"But now, encouraged by the god, they form a ""schiltrom,"" a close"
2147,HOMERIC TACTICS,"clump of spears advanced and levelled, underlying and overlying each"
2148,HOMERIC TACTICS,"other.[9] (The spears of defenders and assailants, at the battle of"
2149,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Langside (1568), were so closely interlocked, that discharged pistols"
2150,HOMERIC TACTICS,and daggers thrown by the combatants lay on them!) Shield touches
2151,HOMERIC TACTICS,"shield, the plumes of the helmets meet.[10]"
2152,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2153,HOMERIC TACTICS,"As was natural, Hector's column was arrested by the ""dark impenetrable"
2154,HOMERIC TACTICS,"wood"" of Achaean spears,[11] and now the poet makes Poseidon, who"
2155,HOMERIC TACTICS,"has lost a grandson (xiii. 207) in the fight, stir up Idomeneus, who"
2156,HOMERIC TACTICS,"is at a distance from Hector's point of attack, and we have the day"
2157,HOMERIC TACTICS,"of valour, and the success of the Cretan prince, on the left of the"
2158,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Achaean fortified position. The Boeotians there, with the Athenians and"
2159,HOMERIC TACTICS,"""Ionian tunic-trailers,"" are hard pressed, but the Aiantes make a stout"
2160,HOMERIC TACTICS,"resistance, and the arrows of the Locrians are showered on Hector's"
2161,HOMERIC TACTICS,"column.[12] Polydamas advises Hector to retreat, but he hurries off and"
2162,HOMERIC TACTICS,brings up reinforcements in good order. He then tries again and again
2163,HOMERIC TACTICS,"to break through the schiltrom of the Achaean dismounted men-at-arms,"
2164,HOMERIC TACTICS,and the two forces clash with cries of onset.[13]
2165,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2166,HOMERIC TACTICS,Here we have a renewal of the steady conflict of men duly marshalled.
2167,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Hector, however, is put out of action, sore smitten by a boulder from"
2168,HOMERIC TACTICS,"the hand of Aias; the Trojans give ground, are pursued, and fall back,"
2169,HOMERIC TACTICS,"till when Hector revives, Aias and the princes who joined him at the"
2170,HOMERIC TACTICS,"command of Poseidon, form a firm line of resistance.[14]"
2171,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2172,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Again there is a dogged contest of marshalled forces, till Apollo"
2173,HOMERIC TACTICS,"causes a panic among the Achaeans, and their line is broken. ""Then man"
2174,HOMERIC TACTICS,"fell upon man _when the close fight was scattered_,""[15] and we have"
2175,HOMERIC TACTICS,"a new set of individual valiances, among the bravest; but the Achaean"
2176,HOMERIC TACTICS,"host is flying in disorderly rout, ""hither and thither in terror,"""
2177,HOMERIC TACTICS,through the ditch and within the wall.
2178,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2179,HOMERIC TACTICS,"It is in his chariot, to which he had been carried when stunned by"
2180,HOMERIC TACTICS,"the boulder, that Hector now calls for a chariot charge on the fosse"
2181,HOMERIC TACTICS,"and wall, which Apollo makes possible by levelling the wall into the"
2182,HOMERIC TACTICS,"dyke.[16] After mixed fighting, the spear of Aias is lopped in twain by"
2183,HOMERIC TACTICS,"the sword of Hector, and fire is thrown into the ship of Protesilaus."
2184,HOMERIC TACTICS,This is the moment that Achilles has prayed and longed for since the
2185,HOMERIC TACTICS,"first book of the poem. Addressing Agamemnon, he then swore a great"
2186,HOMERIC TACTICS,"oath by the sceptre that ""longing for Achilles shall come upon the"
2187,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Achaeans one and all, when multitudes fall dying before manslaying"
2188,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Hector.""[17] In the same book he bids Thetis pray to Zeus to ""hem the"
2189,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Achaeans among the sterns of their ships, given over to slaughter.""[18]"
2190,HOMERIC TACTICS,"When the Embassy sought Achilles in Book ix., with the offers of"
2191,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Agamemnon, this dire need had not fallen on the Achaeans, and Achilles"
2192,HOMERIC TACTICS,"rejected their prayers. But he promised to fight if Hector, as he"
2193,HOMERIC TACTICS,"burned the ships, came to those of the Myrmidons.[19]"
2194,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2195,HOMERIC TACTICS,Hector never came so far; for[20] though Achilles kept the letter
2196,HOMERIC TACTICS,"of his vow in Book ix., and did not arm, he sent Patroclus forth in"
2197,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Achilles' armour, at the head of the Myrmidons, and their charge on"
2198,HOMERIC TACTICS,rear and flank drove the Trojans far from the ships and the wall.
2199,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2200,HOMERIC TACTICS,"This is a brief summary of the main movements in the engagement, up to"
2201,HOMERIC TACTICS,"the moment when Achilles let slip the Myrmidons. We see that, setting"
2202,HOMERIC TACTICS,"aside the interferences of gods, and the pardonable exaggeration of"
2203,HOMERIC TACTICS,"the prowess of favourite heroes, we have a set of as natural pictures"
2204,HOMERIC TACTICS,of the flux and reflux of battle-tides as if we were reading about
2205,HOMERIC TACTICS,Waterloo. The character of the engagements is conditioned by the use
2206,HOMERIC TACTICS,"of dismounted men-at-arms as heavy infantry, whether employed in lines"
2207,HOMERIC TACTICS,"of resistance, in squares or schiltroms of levelled spears, or in"
2208,HOMERIC TACTICS,"columns of attack. The fighting men in view are the gentry, stiffening"
2209,HOMERIC TACTICS,"""the host,"" the [Greek: _laos_] of whose equipment we know little,"
2210,HOMERIC TACTICS,"while the archery of light-armed bowmen, such as the Locrians, is not"
2211,HOMERIC TACTICS,"without its effect. But the bows are short, and the arrow is drawn"
2212,HOMERIC TACTICS,"only to the breast, not, as by Egyptian and Assyrian archers, on"
2213,HOMERIC TACTICS,"the monuments, and by the archers of mediaeval England, to the ear."
2214,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Chariots are not employed, in Homer, as on the Egyptian monuments, in"
2215,HOMERIC TACTICS,"charging squadrons, closely and neatly arranged, but in the flight and"
2216,HOMERIC TACTICS,"the pursuit, and to bear the prince rapidly to distant points of the"
2217,HOMERIC TACTICS,field.[21]
2218,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2219,HOMERIC TACTICS,The most obvious and closest analogy to Homeric warfare is that of
2220,HOMERIC TACTICS,the period (1300-1430 A.D.) when the Flemings and Scots had shown the
2221,HOMERIC TACTICS,powerlessness of charges of heavy cavalry against the schiltroms of
2222,HOMERIC TACTICS,"spearmen, if these had not been broken up by ""artillery preparation,"""
2223,HOMERIC TACTICS,"by the long bow. Henceforth the English knights, squires, and ""lances,"""
2224,HOMERIC TACTICS,"or men-at-arms dismounted, their horses being held in reserve, and"
2225,HOMERIC TACTICS,"received the attacks of the heavy French cavalry on foot, with spear,"
2226,HOMERIC TACTICS,"sword, and axe. In case of defeat (which did not occur) or of pursuit,"
2227,HOMERIC TACTICS,"the horses were in readiness. Heavy armed infantry, like the hoplites"
2228,HOMERIC TACTICS,"of historic Greece, were developed later than Homer, and the heavy"
2229,HOMERIC TACTICS,cavalry then became a separate arm. The changes occurred in the dim age
2230,HOMERIC TACTICS,between the date of the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ and the dawn of historic
2231,HOMERIC TACTICS,Greece. Chariots ceased to be employed in war by the Greek cities of
2232,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Asia. The chief arm was the heavy drilled infantry, the hoplites. We"
2233,HOMERIC TACTICS,catch our first glimpses of them on the Warrior Vase of the upper and
2234,HOMERIC TACTICS,"later stratum at Mycenae, and on an old sculptured Mycenaean stele,"
2235,HOMERIC TACTICS,"later ""plastered over and painted in fresco."" In the former is a line"
2236,HOMERIC TACTICS,"of swordless spearmen on the march; on the latter, a row of swordless"
2237,HOMERIC TACTICS,spearmen in the act of brandishing the spear. Their bucklers are worn
2238,HOMERIC TACTICS,"on the left arm: they appear to wear hauberks, not corslets of plate,"
2239,HOMERIC TACTICS,but one cannot be certain.[22] In these figures we see the germ of the
2240,HOMERIC TACTICS,"infantry of historic Hellas. The war chariot becoming obsolete, civic"
2241,HOMERIC TACTICS,cavalry were employed; the horsemen of Colophon were celebrated for
2242,HOMERIC TACTICS,dealing a fatal conclusive charge.
2243,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2244,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Nothing could be much less like Homeric than historical Ionian warfare,"
2245,HOMERIC TACTICS,except in so far as Homer's dismounted men-at-arms resemble the heavy
2246,HOMERIC TACTICS,"historic infantry, who never mount."
2247,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2248,HOMERIC TACTICS,We have now given a brief sketch of Homer's idea of a general
2249,HOMERIC TACTICS,engagement in force. The clash of marshalled lines of heavy dismounted
2250,HOMERIC TACTICS,"men-at-arms ends in the breaking of the phalanxes, and in the single"
2251,HOMERIC TACTICS,"combats, or combats of small knots of heroes, in which the poet and his"
2252,HOMERIC TACTICS,audience take special delight.
2253,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2254,HOMERIC TACTICS,We now criticise the modern criticisms of Homeric pictures of battles.
2255,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2256,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Herr Mülder, in 1906, and Mr. Murray, in 1908, discover that Homeric"
2257,HOMERIC TACTICS,formations and fighting are a confusion of the methods of historic
2258,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Greece--with drilled hoplites and cavalry,--and the ""Mycenaean"" system"
2259,HOMERIC TACTICS,"of ""a battle of _promachoi_ or champions.""[23]"
2260,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2261,HOMERIC TACTICS,"According to the English critic, in the Iliad ""the men are, so to"
2262,HOMERIC TACTICS,"speak, advertised as fighting in one way, and then they proceed"
2263,HOMERIC TACTICS,"to fight in another.""[24] As we have seen, they are ""advertised as"
2264,HOMERIC TACTICS,"fighting in one way,"" that is, in ordered phalanxes of dismounted"
2265,HOMERIC TACTICS,"men-at-arms, and they _do_ fight in that way, from dawn till noon; and"
2266,HOMERIC TACTICS,"then when ""the phalanxes are broken,"" when ""the battle is scattered,"""
2267,HOMERIC TACTICS,"they ""fight in another way""; there is flight, pursuit, and examples"
2268,HOMERIC TACTICS,"of individual valour; there is a rally, and the lines of men on foot"
2269,HOMERIC TACTICS,re-form. What else could there possibly be? The charge of the Union
2270,HOMERIC TACTICS,"brigade, at Waterloo, begins by ""fighting in one way,"" a resistless"
2271,HOMERIC TACTICS,"charge of squadrons, and ends by ""fighting in another way,"" in knots,"
2272,HOMERIC TACTICS,"with individual examples of flight, or of single prowess, when"
2273,HOMERIC TACTICS,Piré's Red Lancers swoop down on the scattered and broken ranks.
2274,HOMERIC TACTICS,At Bannockburn you have the slow advance of the clogged English
2275,HOMERIC TACTICS,"columns on a narrow front, you have the slow advance in mass of the"
2276,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Scottish spearmen, till ""the phalanxes are broken"" of England, and"
2277,HOMERIC TACTICS,"then comes the isolated struggle of Edward II., and the charge of"
2278,HOMERIC TACTICS,"d'Argentine,--alone."
2279,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2280,HOMERIC TACTICS,"It was always thus that men fought, before the invention of modern"
2281,HOMERIC TACTICS,"projectiles. It was thus they fought at Inkerman, nay, for a moment at"
2282,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Waggon Hill, as one who was in the thick of it informs me. Ian Hamilton"
2283,HOMERIC TACTICS,"and de Villiers, Albrecht and Digby Jones were among the _promachoi_."
2284,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2285,HOMERIC TACTICS,"There is no confusion of a ""Mycenaean"" and a historic mode of battle in"
2286,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Homer; and we have absolutely no evidence as to how a ""Mycenaean"" or"
2287,HOMERIC TACTICS,Aegean general engagement was conducted: no Aegean work of art in which
2288,HOMERIC TACTICS,it is represented.[25]
2289,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2290,HOMERIC TACTICS,There is no confusion of military styles in Homer; the trouble is
2291,HOMERIC TACTICS,caused when Herr Mülder chooses to say that there is confusion;
2292,HOMERIC TACTICS,that a fight of masses is _promised_ (apparently by an Ionian
2293,HOMERIC TACTICS,"interpolator), and that single combats are _given_ (apparently by the"
2294,HOMERIC TACTICS,older minstrel).[26] Both sorts of fighting are given in their proper
2295,HOMERIC TACTICS,"places: the engagement of masses before, the individual valiances after"
2296,HOMERIC TACTICS,"""the battle is scattered,"" while in the clash of the massed forces,"
2297,HOMERIC TACTICS,the conduct of prominent assailants and defenders is noted. Mülder's
2298,HOMERIC TACTICS,remarks arise from his eagerness to prove that not only the armature is
2299,HOMERIC TACTICS,"a muddle of anachronisms, which is not the case, but that the fighting,"
2300,HOMERIC TACTICS,"too, is anachronistic and self-contradictory."
2301,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2302,HOMERIC TACTICS,"The aged Nestor remembers and approves of a mode of fighting which,"
2303,HOMERIC TACTICS,"at Troy, has become obsolete, owing to the new system of dismounting"
2304,HOMERIC TACTICS,the men-at-arms and arraying them in line or in column of attack. He
2305,HOMERIC TACTICS,"says to his Pylians (_Iliad_, iv. 303 _seqq_.), ""Neither let any man,"
2306,HOMERIC TACTICS,"trusting to his horsemanship and valour, be eager to fight the Trojans"
2307,HOMERIC TACTICS,"alone before the rest, nor yet let him draw back.... But whensoever a"
2308,HOMERIC TACTICS,"warrior from his own chariot can come at the chariot of the foe, let"
2309,HOMERIC TACTICS,"him thrust forth with his spear, even so is the far better way,"" the"
2310,HOMERIC TACTICS,"_old_ way. ""The style of fighting is not Epic,"" says Mr. Leaf. It is"
2311,HOMERIC TACTICS,"meant not to be ""Epic""; it is old-fashioned, like Nestor."
2312,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2313,HOMERIC TACTICS,"We know ""the old way"" from pictures on Egyptian monuments, showing the"
2314,HOMERIC TACTICS,"charge of squadrons using the bow, and routing an irregular advance of"
2315,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Hittite chariotry, using the spear. But, under Troy, the combatants"
2316,HOMERIC TACTICS,"usually fight dismounted; always, in the opening of a general action."
2317,HOMERIC TACTICS,"But though Nestor recommends the old chariotry tactics, Herr Mülder"
2318,HOMERIC TACTICS,"says that he is recommending the historic, ""the modern method,"" and"
2319,HOMERIC TACTICS,attributing it to the old military school of his youth ([Greek: oi
2320,HOMERIC TACTICS,"proteroi]).[27] The general purpose is to prove that ""edifying passages"
2321,HOMERIC TACTICS,from the old Ionic hortatory writers seem to have been introduced into
2322,HOMERIC TACTICS,"Homer.""[28]"
2323,HOMERIC TACTICS,
2324,HOMERIC TACTICS,The tactics and military formations of Homer are as intelligible as
2325,HOMERIC TACTICS,those of Chandos and Henry v. They can only be misunderstood by critics
2326,HOMERIC TACTICS,under the suggestion of the idea that the _Iliad_ is riddled with
2327,HOMERIC TACTICS,Ionian tamperings. The Ionians never touched the matter of the _Iliad_.

2418,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2419,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2420,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,As the following remarks are inevitably full of minute and complex
2421,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"detail, it may be well to say briefly what I wish to prove. According"
2422,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"to the view of many critics, German and English, the ""early lays"" of"
2423,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"the _Iliad_ were composed when men wore smocks or chitons, like the"
2424,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Greeks of the historic ages. In war, on this theory, they wore no"
2425,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"armour save the huge body--covering shields of Aegean art, but _not_"
2426,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,the loin-cloth or the bathing-drawers which were the sole costume of
2427,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"the Aegean fighting man. The Homeric warrior of the ""early lays"" was"
2428,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"thus accoutred; like the Aegean warrior, he had no body armour save"
2429,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"the shield, but, by way of dress, he had the smock or chiton, not the"
2430,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,loin-cloth.
2431,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2432,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,On this theory the corslet did not come into vogue till the eighth to
2433,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"seventh century. Then it arrived with the _zoster_, or mailed belt, and"
2434,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"the _mitrê_, or mailed kirtle. When these had been accepted, the huge"
2435,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"early shield, slung by a baldric, was discarded for the round or oval"
2436,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"parrying buckler, blazoned with a device, and carried on the left arm."
2437,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,The smock or chiton continued to be worn. Ionian poets interpolated
2438,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"their corslet, mitre, zoster, and greaves into passages of old lays"
2439,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,that originally knew no such armour. The result was confused nonsense.
2440,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2441,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Against all this I am to contend that greaves, bronze corslets of"
2442,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"plate, bronze girdles, and mailed kirtles were known in Aegean times"
2443,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,long before the arrival of the Achaeans in Crete: proof is given from
2444,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"a work of Aegean art. Secondly, hauberks of metal scales were worn"
2445,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,in very early post-Homeric times; and Homer minutely describes such
2446,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"hauberks, which clasped in front and back. Thirdly, the Ionian armour"
2447,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"of the eighth, seventh, and early sixth centuries was not Homeric. Men"
2448,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"wore, not hauberks of mail, clasping at front and back, but corslets"
2449,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,with breast-plate and back-plate fastened at the sides; with these
2450,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,they wore neither mailed belt nor mailed kirtle. They wore not only
2451,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"greaves, but protective thigh-pieces (_parameridia_) unknown to Homer."
2452,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"But, about 530 B.C., these corslets of plate began to go out, and yield"
2453,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"place to hauberks of mail, clasping at front and back; and with these"
2454,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"were worn mailed belts and mailed kirtles, but no thigh-pieces. In"
2455,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Homer this is the usual equipment, though corslets of plate appear also"
2456,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,to be known.
2457,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2458,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"As to dress, the Ionian warrior of the eighth to early sixth century"
2459,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,did not wear in active life the Homeric smock or chiton. He either
2460,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"reverted to the Aegean loin-cloth or drawers, or he wore a very tight"
2461,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"curt jerkin, coming down no lower than the buttocks. It was when the"
2462,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"mailed hauberk, mailed belt, and mailed flaps under the belt came in,"
2463,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"that the smock or chiton also reappeared, and the tight curt jerkin or"
2464,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,the loin-cloth went out.
2465,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2466,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,Thus the Ionian minstrels did not bring into old lays armour which
2467,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"they did not wear, and the chiton which they did not wear they did"
2468,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"not excise. Nor did any one, at any time, foist in the round Ionian"
2469,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,parrying shield on the left arm: the Homeric body-covering shield hung
2470,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"by a baldric retained its place. Women, too, I am to argue, reverted"
2471,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"on occasion to the Aegean tight bodice, small waist and skirt, or wore"
2472,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"a chiton tight, comparatively short, and not, like the Homeric peplos,"
2473,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"long, loose, and trailing. But these intermediate periods, between the"
2474,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Homeric and historic, left not a trace in the pictures presented by the"
2475,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,_Iliad_ and _Odyssey_.
2476,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2477,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Why was the new Ionian armour introduced, as we are told it was, while"
2478,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,the un-Homeric features in dress were not introduced into the poems?
2479,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2480,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Coming to men's dress in Homer, we do not know exactly how long the"
2481,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,ordinary Homeric chiton was. If the word [Greek: termioeis] means
2482,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"""reaching to the feet,"" it would apply well to a shield of the huge"
2483,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Mycenaean make, and to a chiton, and it is used of both.[1] But"
2484,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"some take it to mean ""fringed,"" which cannot apply to the Mycenaean"
2485,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"shield, or to chitons as represented anywhere except perhaps in the"
2486,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,Warrior Vase (sub-Mycenæan) of Mycenae. No brooches are mentioned as
2487,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"fastening chitons, and it rather appears that these resembled the very"
2488,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"short-sleeved, rather loose, and not girdled sewn smock of the lowest"
2489,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"figure in the Mycenaean ""siege vase."" Eumaeus the swine-herd belts"
2490,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"his chiton with a girdle when he goes out to his work.[2] Probably,"
2491,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"therefore, it reached the feet, and had to be ""kirtled up."" Now the"
2492,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"curt jerkin of seventh to sixth century art needs no tucking up, it"
2493,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"merely covers the buttocks. The material was linen, if the name chiton"
2494,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,be derived from a Semitic word for linen.
2495,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2496,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"When we read that the tunic of Odysseus was ""shining like the skin of"
2497,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"a dried onion, so soft it was, and bright as the sun,"" it is not quite"
2498,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"clear whether it was as _tight_, or as bright, as the onion skin; and"
2499,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"perhaps its brilliance suggests that it was of silk, rather than of"
2500,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"linen, unstarched."
2501,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2502,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"A person who comes fresh from Homer to the study of Greek archaic art,"
2503,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"of the latest eighth, the seventh, and the sixth centuries, cannot but"
2504,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"be struck by the fact, rather neglected by writers on costume, that the"
2505,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"men are _not_ wearing the Homeric chiton, which needs to be kirtled up"
2506,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"in active life. On the other hand, ""on the earliest vases the men"
2507,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"are often nude, with the exception of a loin-cloth or pair of tight"
2508,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"fitting bathing-drawers.""[3] This is the usual pre-Achaean dress of"
2509,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"men in Minoan art. In archaic Greek art, men often wear either a very"
2510,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"tight jerkin, covering the trunk, or, ""on the earliest vases,"" the men"
2511,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,have reverted from the Homeric chiton to the Aegean loin-cloth and
2512,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"bathing-drawers. Either this is the case, or the men, in fact, never"
2513,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"wore the chiton in the ""earliest"" lays; the chiton, like the armour, as"
2514,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"we are told, must have been introduced by the ""tunic-trailing Ionians."""
2515,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Yet these Ionians, or any Greeks of the eighth to seventh centuries,"
2516,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"in their art are represented as wearing loin-cloths, bathing-drawers,"
2517,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"or curt tight jerkins needing not to be girdled up, except in cases of"
2518,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"reverend seignors, in a house of repose, and at festivals. (See fig. 1.)"
2519,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,

2521,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2522,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"One or other or all of the tight curt men's garments--loin-cloth,"
2523,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"bathing-drawers, or jerkin, reaching from the shoulders to just below"
2524,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"the buttocks--was called in Ionia the _cypassis_, a term as much"
2525,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,unknown to Homer as the article itself.
2526,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2527,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,The [Greek: _kupussis_] is mentioned by Alcaeus (611 B.C.) and prayed
2528,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"for by Hipponax, an Ephesian poet contemporary with Croesus: in art we"
2529,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,find it represented from the eighth to the sixth century.[4] Such a
2530,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"dress, with a very broad belt, is a male costume common for archers and"
2531,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"men at work, in the Assyrian art of the eighth to seventh centuries and"
2532,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,in Aztec art![5]
2533,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2534,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"It is a good dress for fighting men; its fashion changes, and finally"
2535,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"it divides down the front, below the belt, with embroidered borders, in"
2536,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,Assyrian and archaic Greek art. In some cases it does not suffice for
2537,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"decency. This is not the Homeric chiton, especially if that reached to"
2538,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"the feet, and needed to be girdled when a man went about active work."
2539,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"At peaceful festivals, Ionians wore the ""trailing chiton,"" in active"
2540,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,life the un-Homeric tight curt garment.
2541,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2542,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"We may understand, I think, that between the age when the Homeric poems"
2543,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"were composed, and the eighth century B.C., men's costume had greatly"
2544,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"altered. The Homeric chiton did not cease to exist, but it was worn by"
2545,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"men merely on festive occasions, and by old men; while the dress in"
2546,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"active life reverted towards the Aegean costume, the bathing-drawers,"
2547,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"or even loin-cloth; or more usually became the short tight jersey,"
2548,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,covering the trunk and the upper part of the thigh. This is a natural
2549,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,reversion. The Achaean invaders from the colder north had practically
2550,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"worn smock and plaid, chiton and chlaina. In the warmer south they"
2551,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,found the tight and curt _cypassis_ more suitable. In the sixth to
2552,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"fifth century the chiton gradually reasserts itself, as we see in the"
2553,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"late black figure, and still more manifestly in the red figure vases."
2554,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"The chiton is a more graceful, decent, and civilised dress than the"
2555,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,short tight _cypassis_.
2556,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2557,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Either this was the course of evolution, or ""late"" poets inserted the"
2558,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,chiton as worn both in peace and war into every part of the _Iliad_ and
2559,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"_Odyssey_; though, in fact, they saw only old men, or men on formal"
2560,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"occasions, wearing the chiton. Or they applied the word ""chiton,"" in"
2561,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"poetry, to the tight curt garments which were not in the least like the"
2562,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,chiton of Homer.
2563,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2564,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,The alternative explanation is that Homer's men actually wore the
2565,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,fairly long smock which needed to be girdled up for active work; and
2566,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,that the word and the thing itself survived in the poems through an age
2567,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"when men in general wore the tight curt jerkin, or even the loin-cloth"
2568,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,or bathing-drawers.
2569,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2570,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"The _chlaina_ of the Homeric men was a mantle, usually of wool,"
2571,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"fastened with a golden fibula, like that of Odysseus. On the cover"
2572,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,of the pin was represented to the life a hound catching a fawn.[6]
2573,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,This _chlaina_ was red in colour and was double-folded. The great
2574,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"overgarment, the _pharos_, was usually of linen; and both these"
2575,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"articles were unshaped and unsewn, mere pieces of material, also used"

2579,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2580,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"However we account for it, there was a long period in which Greek"
2581,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,prehistoric and proto-historic dress was not the free-flowing costume
2582,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"which Homer describes, and which the appearance of safety pins, or"

2585,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2586,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,Now no critic has had the heart to say that the costume described by
2587,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Homer, the loose chiton, was ""written into"" early epic lays (which"
2588,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"originally knew it not), at the moment when it came into fashion in the"
2589,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,sixth to fifth centuries. But criticism has taken a similar course in
2590,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"regard to Homeric armour. This armour, like Homeric male costume, is"
2591,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"in essence, we shall show, that of the sixth to fifth centuries B.C."
2592,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"with the exception of the shield,--a huge body-covering shield in Homer"
2593,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"(a shield probably of various shapes, circular, oblong, cylindrical or"

2595,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,the seventh to fifth centuries we find a round or oval blazoned buckler
2596,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"worn on the left arm. While critics, following Reich el, attribute the"
2597,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Homeric body armour to Ionian interpolations of the seventh century,"
2598,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,they have also followed him in not observing that Homeric body armour
2599,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"is not that of the seventh, but rather of the sixth to fifth centuries,"
2600,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,as we shall prove.
2601,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2602,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"We find, in art of the sixth to fifth centuries, or at least in the end"
2603,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"of the sixth and the opening of the fifth centuries, such hauberks as"
2604,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,Homer describes; they have variegated patterns of bronze scales; they
2605,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"are clasped down the front, and below are the bronze belt (_zoster_)"
2606,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"and [Greek: pteruges], or mailed flaps."
2607,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2608,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"On the other hand, the Ionic corslet of the seventh and earlier"
2609,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"sixth century is made of plain plates of bronze, fastened at the"

2611,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"rim to protect the hip-joints. There is no mailed kirtle, no decorated"

2617,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"probably fixed on leather, begins to come in towards the end of the"
2618,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"sixth century. Early in the fifth century, Polygnotus decorated the"

2620,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"illustrating the _Little Iliad_, an Ionian cyclic poem attributed to"
2621,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Lesches. Among the pictures, says Pausanias, was represented an altar,"
2622,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"and on it was a ""bronze corslet, such as was worn of old, for now we"
2623,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"seldom see them. It consisted of two pieces called _guala_, one to"
2624,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"cover breast and belly, the other for the back, fastened by clasps."""
2625,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Unconsciously anticipating Reichel, Pausanias says that this piece"
2626,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"of armour would be protection enough, ""without a shield,"" as if a"
2627,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"shield could simultaneously protect both back and front. ""And so Homer"
2628,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"represents Phorcys the Phrygian without a shield,""[9] ""because he wore"
2629,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"this kind of corslet.""[10] Homer says that the spear of Aias burst"
2630,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"the _gualon_ of Phorcys, and the bronze let out the entrails.[11] The"
2631,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"shield of Phorcys, if he wore one, must have been slung over his back"
2632,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,or side at the moment. But in these two passages Homer seems to have in
2633,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"his mind a corslet of but two _guala_, back-plate and breast-plate"
2634,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"fastened at the sides, like the eighth to sixth century corslet. If"
2635,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"so, he knew both the corslet of two plates, fastened at the sides, and"
2636,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,also the hauberk of scales or small plates of metal fastened in the
2637,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"centre of front and back. This is not impossible, for, as we shall"
2638,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"prove, the corslet of metal plate was worn even in pre-Homeric Crete;"
2639,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"while the hauberk is represented, if I am right, in art of the Dipylon,"
2640,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,or pre-Dipylon period. Art in the late sixth century proves that both
2641,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"the corslet of back-plate and breast-plate, and the hauberk of small"
2642,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"plates, fastening at back and in front, were worn."

2661,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"_Monuments_. Judging from the later black figure vases, the process"
2662,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"was gradual; some warriors wear the old back-plate, breast-plate, and"

2664,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"plated [Greek: pteruges], or flaps, with or without the bronze girdle"

2676,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2677,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Yet modern criticism, while it finds no fault with the sixth to fifth"

2682,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,the seventh century. We shall show that the back-plate and breast-plate
2683,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"of the seventh century are not the hauberk, clasping down the middle,"
2684,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,of some passages in Homer; and that the jutting bronze rim of the
2685,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"seventh century is not the _mitrê_ of Homer. Thus, if there were late"
2686,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"interpolations of armour into Homer, they cannot have been made, as"
2687,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Reichel thought, in the seventh century, but very late, say 540-470"
2688,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"B.C., when armour shifted from bronze back-plate, breast-plate, and"
2689,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"rim, to scaled hauberk, shoulder pieces, _zoster_, and metal plated"
2690,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"flaps, equivalent in protective purpose to the _mitrê_."
2691,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2692,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"The modern theory that Homeric armour is of the seventh century,"
2693,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"which it demonstrably is not, starts from the late Dr. Reichel's"
2694,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,essay on Homeric armour.[13] Reichel built on very slender and sandy
2695,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,foundations. He supposed that in the oldest parts of the Epics men
2696,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"fought _in battle_ as six or seven men, in Aegean art, fight in _chance"
2697,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"encounters_ (that is, almost naked, or with shields which conceal the"
2698,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"body, also taken for granted as naked). He did not know the proof of"
2699,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"the existence of Aegean body armour, which we shall cite, and he really"
2700,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"evolved things ""out of his inner consciousness."""
2701,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2702,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Reichel, we must add, could not argue securely from the absence of"
2703,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,actual corslets in grave-furniture of the Aegean age. Though hauberks
2704,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"occur constantly in the art, they are not found in the _graves_ of"
2705,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"the sixth to fifth centuries, in Greece; and even plate corslets are"
2706,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"extremely rare. In Reichel's second edition, which he, unfortunately,"
2707,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"left incomplete at his regretted death, ""he contemplated an important"
2708,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,change of ground.... He regards the thin gold plates found on
2709,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,the breasts of the skeletons at Mykene as possibly the funereal
2710,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"representatives of metal sewn on to the chiton, and thus forming a"
2711,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"prae-Ionic corslet.""[14]"
2712,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2713,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Had he lived, he would have seen an undeniable ""prae-Ionic corslet,"""
2714,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"no hauberk but a cuirass of plate, on the Minoan seal impressions of"
2715,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,Haghia Triada.
2716,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2717,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,But the evidence for the non-existence of prae-Ionic corslets based on
2718,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"their absence from tombs, even if it were absolute, which it is not,"
2719,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,would have been of little avail. How many Ionic plate corslets are in
2720,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"actual existence, to our knowledge? Only fragments of one, as far as I"
2721,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"am aware, and that one is not ""Ionic,"" it was found at Olympia, and is"
2722,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"""archaic."" The fragments are of bronze plate, with decorations in the"
2723,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"archaic style, figures of men and women in archaic costume.[15] Thus"
2724,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,the non-existence of objects represented often in the art of remote
2725,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,ages cannot be demonstrated by our failure to discover specimens of
2726,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,them.
2727,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2728,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,Reichel proceeds from the imaginary postulate that a man who has
2729,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,a body-covering shield dispenses with body armour. As a matter of
2730,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"historical fact he often does not.[16] Next, the Aegean shield, being"
2731,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"heavy, made chariots necessary. (But chariots have been used in war by"
2732,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"races with small shields, and the great shield is worn by Aias and"
2733,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Odysseus who had no chariots.) Next, says Reichel, parrying bucklers"
2734,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"coming in as early as the archaic art (say 700-620 B.C.), big shields"
2735,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"went out, and for protection the corslet, metal girdle, and _mitrê_, a"
2736,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"mailed kirtle, were adopted about 700 B.C. As it was now ridiculous,"
2737,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"says Reichel, to think of a man fighting only in his shirt, late poets"
2738,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"introduced body armour into old portions of the _Iliad_, made when body"
2739,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,armour was unknown.
2740,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2741,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Of course, by parity of reasoning, the new poets ought also to have"
2742,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"got rid of chariots, bronze weapons, cairn-burial, the bride-price,"
2743,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Homeric chitons, and so forth, all of them obsolete or little used"
2744,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"things in the age (700-600 B.C.) of corslets, greaves, and body armour."
2745,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Their warriors should also have worn the contemporary tight fleshings,"
2746,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"with the _cypassis_, and _parameridia, cuisses_, tight thigh pieces"
2747,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"(the ""taslets"" of 1640 A.D.). That did not happen; Homer knows no"
2748,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"thigh pieces or _parameridia_, so common in Greek armour of the sixth"
2749,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"century; but, says Mr. Murray, ""all the heroes were summarily provided"
2750,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"with breast-plates, [Greek: _thoorêkes_].""[17] Mr. Leaf, on the other"
2751,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"hand, denies this; ""the corslet is given to some only, and that in the"
2752,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"most capricious fashion.""[18]"
2753,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2754,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,Mr. Leaf's contention (Mr. Murray's is an _obiter dictum_) rests on the
2755,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"postulate that, when the corslet is not explicitly named in connection"
2756,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"with a hero, he has no corslet; he has only a shield. If so, why are"
2757,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"his ""pieces of armour"" ([Greek: _teuchea_]), whether he is putting them"
2758,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"on or off, whether he is being stripped of them or is stripping others,"
2759,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,always called [Greek: teuchea] in the plural? Aias is not explicitly
2760,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"said to have a corslet, but the space of time occupied by his arming"
2761,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"he asks the Achaeans to devote to prayer to Zeus. ""So said they, while"
2762,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,Aias arrayed him in flashing bronze. And when he had now clothed upon
2763,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"his flesh all his armour....""[19] The time required, and the phrase"
2764,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"""all his armour"" which ""clothes his flesh,"" cannot possibly apply to"
2765,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"slinging on or off a shield, and donning or doffing a helmet, the work"
2766,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"of five seconds. The sword was always worn, in peace and in war."
2767,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2768,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,This is so certain that we waste no more space over the matter. All
2769,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"the gentry wear [Greek: teuchea], ""pieces of armour,"" which they all"
2770,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"take off and lay on the ground while they watch a duel, and which they"
2771,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"always, when they can, strip from a fallen foe. Thus, before the duel"
2772,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"between Paris and Menelaus, the men-at-arms dismount, take off their"
2773,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"armour, and lay it on the ground.[20] They themselves ""are leaning"
2774,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"on their great shields,"" which are not their armour.[21] This use of"
2775,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"[Greek: teuchea] is universal in Homer, and so, for men-at-arms, is the"
2776,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,possession of body armour.[22]
2777,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2778,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,The difficulties which critics find in the details and mechanism of the
2779,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"armour cannot be impossibilities, for the ""later poets"" were familiar"
2780,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"with corslets, and would not write nonsense about them. The opposing"
2781,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,theory is that Ionian minstrels introduced the corslet of their own
2782,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"age, seventh century, (corslets not uniformly to be found in Homer), to"
2783,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"satisfy the practical warriors who wore it. Yet, in doing so, the poets"
2784,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"made incoherent nonsense. As Miss Stawell writes, ""a warlike audience,"
2785,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"versed in the use of the corslet, insisted on its introduction in the"
2786,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"poems,--and yet never objected to the absurdities it introduced,--such"
2787,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"a theory cannot bear thinking out.""[23] When we came to discuss Homeric"
2788,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"tactics, we found precisely the same objection to the German theories;"
2789,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,they represent the poets as pleasing military experts by writing
2790,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,nonsense.
2791,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2792,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,The body armour is thus an integral part of the poem. The word [Greek:
2793,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"_thooreissestai_], to put on the _thorex_ or breast covering, is"
2794,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"constantly employed in the general sense of arming, both in _Iliad_"
2795,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"and _Odyssey,_ though in the latter no corslet is specifically named."
2796,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,It would have been as easy to coin a verb for arming from [Greek:
2797,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"_aspis_], the shield, in an age when shields were the only armour. That"
2798,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,[Greek: _thooreiks_] should ever have been a term for the shield seems
2799,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,to me incredible.
2800,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2801,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"The corslet has many epithets, expressing the elaborateness of its"
2802,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"decoration, such as [Greek: _poikilos, panaiolos, polydaidalos_]; and"
2803,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,no such words apply to the plain metal plates of corslets in archaic
2804,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Greek art of the eighth to early sixth centuries, as shown in art. At"
2805,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"most they were etched with designs of men and women, as in the example"
2806,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"from Olympia, or have two volutes. The corslet was made of [Greek:"
2807,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"_gyala_] whatever they may have precisely been, for sometimes the"
2808,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,epithets applied to the Homeric corslet do not suit plate but mailed
2809,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,armour.

2814,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2815,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Reichel argued from the absence of corslet, belt, greaves, and mailed"
2816,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"kirtle in the few pieces of Aegean art known to him, that no such"
2817,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"armour was used by Aegeans, and, again, that no such armour was"
2818,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,known to the Achaeans. He was unacquainted with the scores of seal
2819,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,impressions which have been found at Haghia Triada in Crete.[24] The
2820,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"seals, it has been said, show a man in what Dr. Halbherr recognises as"
2821,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"a heavy decorated _plate_ corslet, with an obviously metallic belt, and"
2822,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"below it a mailed kilt or apron, the Homeric _mitrê_. Dr. Mackenzie,"
2823,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"too, recognises the armour.[25], It is unmistakable, and the corslet is"
2824,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"so very wide, considering the wasp-like Mycenaean waist, that a spear"
2825,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"could penetrate the side of it without wounding the wearer, a great"
2826,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,puzzle of the critics when the fact occurs in Homer. (See fig. 4 A).
2827,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2828,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"The armour is out of drawing, the man's head is given in profile, his"
2829,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,armour is given full face. The same error is made by the painter of
2830,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,Menelaus fighting Hector on an archaic dish from Camirus. Euphorbus is
2831,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"lying on his back, but his corslet is given in full face, while his"
2832,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,head is in profile (fig. 5). This is common in archaic Greek art. The
2833,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"arms of the man on the seal are not shown, just as the arms of women"
2834,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,on some Laconian figurines are omitted.[26] There also occurs on the
2835,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"vase of Haghia Triada, a jovial figure in a very loose thick piece"
2836,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"of armour, as some hold,[27] or ""a Minoan cope,"" as others maintain."
2837,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Beneath it is a short jutting ribbed kirtle, as in the seal. I am"
2838,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"unable to decide between cope and cuirass in this instance,[28] but the"

2840,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2841,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,An easy mode of comparing various costumes and pieces of armour as
2842,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"illustrated in archaic and early Greek art, is to glance at Engelmann"
2843,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"and Anderson's _Pictorial Atlas of Iliad and Odyssey_, 1895. It is"
2844,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"prior to the Cretan discoveries, but is useful to students remote from"

2846,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2847,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,We shall first take the evidence of the black figure vases of the sixth
2848,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"century, and then that of the red figure vases which came in near the"

2850,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,common by far in red figure vases. The corslet of a warrior has broad

2901,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2902,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,It is strange that these facts--the seventh century armour and costume
2903,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,are un-Homeric (though we cannot prove that Homer knew _only_ the

2905,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,costume answer closely to Homeric descriptions--have not been observed
2906,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,either by Reichel or his English following. Nor do they notice that the
2907,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"thigh pieces of seventh to sixth century art never occur in Homer, as,"
2908,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"on the Reichelian theory, they ought to do; practical warriors would"
2909,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,expect to hear of them from the late minstrels. We now prove Homer's
2910,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"knowledge of the hauberk, clasped at front and back."
2911,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2912,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,There is a passage in the _Iliad_ (iv. 132-140) which vexes critics; we
2913,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"give it in Mr. Leaf's translation. To ruin the Trojans, Athene makes"
2914,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Pandarus break the oath of truce, and shoot at Menelaus. She then"
2915,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"guides the arrow so that it may merely draw blood. ""Her own hand guided"
2916,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,it where the golden buckles of the belt were clasped and the doubled
2917,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,breast-plate met them. So the bitter arrow lighted ([Greek: epese])
2918,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,upon the firm belt; through the inwrought ([Greek: daidaleoio]) belt
2919,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"it sped, and through the curiously wrought breast-plate it pressed on,"
2920,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"and through the taslet""[31] ([Greek: mitrê], plated kirtle) ""he wore to"
2921,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"shield his flesh, a barrier against darts; and this best shielded him,"
2922,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"yet it passed on even through this,"" and drew blood."
2923,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2924,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"The arrow-head was of iron, not bronze, as was usual, and of a"

2927,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"extracted (line 216) the corslet is not mentioned, as I suppose because"
2928,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,the arrow passed through the place where the corslet clasped in front.
2929,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"When the corslet was unclasped, the arrow had only to be pulled out of"

2933,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2934,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,Now the whole passage is explained by a red figure vase in the Vienna
2935,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Museum (Atlas, figs. 71 a, b, c) (fig. 6). Here we see first, a warrior"
2936,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"in helmet and flowing chiton, putting on his greaves. Next him is a"
2937,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"warrior clasping his variegated hauberk of scales, or small plates,"
2938,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"_in front_, above his mailed kirtle, or flaps; below which floats the"
2939,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,lower part of his chiton; the shoulder-plates of his corslet are still
2940,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"unclasped, and stand up behind his shoulders. For this arrangement see"
2941,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"also Walters, _History of Ancient Pottery_, vol. ii. p. 176, fig. 137."
2942,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"In _Iliad_, xx. 413-417, Achilles sends his spear through the clasping"
2943,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"plate of belt, buckle, and hauberk at the back."
2944,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2945,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"In the third picture (fig. 7), a warrior, fully armed, has his hand"
2946,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,in the richly adorned belt (_zoster_) which he is fixing over the
2947,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,juncture of corslet and mailed kirtle. If an arrow lights on the
2948,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,central clasp of this belt (1) it will pass through the meeting-place
2949,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"in front of his corslet, (2) and then will encounter, especially if it"
2950,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"be a dropping arrow, (3) his mailed flaps or kirtle, exactly as in the"
2951,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,case of Menelaus.[32] Nothing of this kind could occur with the plain
2952,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"plate corslets of the seventh to sixth centuries, which laced at the"
2953,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"sides, and had no mailed kirtle or flaps, and no belt or _zoster_. Thus"
2954,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Homer's armour, in this passage, is precisely that of, say, 520-470"
2955,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"B.C. Meanwhile the arrow-head, whipped with sinew into the wooden"
2956,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"shaft, is of a primitive pattern; and the accompanying reference to the"
2957,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"art of Maeonian and Carian women, in staining ivory red, ""a treasure"
2958,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"for a king,"" shows no notion of the Ionians in Maeonia and Caria, or of"
2959,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,the republics of 510-470 B.C.[33]
2960,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2961,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"If, then, in the late sixth or early fifth century, a poet introduced"
2962,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"the latest type of armour, he also preserved the primitive arrow,"
2963,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,and the political and geographical conditions prior to the Ionian
2964,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,settlements in Asia. This combined innovation and conservatism are
2965,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,incredible.[34]
2966,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2967,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"The general conclusion seems to be that there was, in men's dress and"
2968,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"armour, a break of several centuries during which un-Homeric costume"
2969,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"and armour existed, and that--about the time just preceding the Persian"
2970,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,wars and later--Greece reverted to the Homeric types or men's dress
2971,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"and body armour, while the Homeric shield was _never_ revived. It was"

2973,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"rather than the spear, was the chief weapon of attack, when arrow-heads"
2974,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,were of stone; and it went out when glory was only to be won at close
2975,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,quarters.
2976,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2977,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"Why the plain plate corslet tended to go out, about the time of the"

2979,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"in, a mere _jascran_, it is not easy to conjecture; but probably the"

2981,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"The _jaseran_ went out again, and the plate corslets of our Museums"

2986,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2987,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,It is manifestly open to critics to argue that Homeric armour never
2988,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"existed, in Greece, before the sixth to fifth centuries, and that it"
2989,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"was then interpolated into the Epics. But if they say this, must they"
2990,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"not apply the same argument to Homeric costume, loose and free flowing?"
2991,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,Was that attire also interpolated into the poems at the date when it
2992,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,first appears in art? Or are we to say that the artists who represent
2993,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"it were ""archaising,"" were making a guess at what the costume of the"
2994,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,heroic age might have been?
2995,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,
2996,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"This cannot be, for the dress is the historic Greek costume which they"
2997,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,then wore. As Panathenaic vases maintained archaic costume long out of
2998,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"date, I have not appealed to their evidence as to costume and armour,"
2999,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"but have relied on other vases,--on a vase from Sparta with warriors"
3000,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"rendered in relief,[35] on a gem cited, on a remarkable bronze in the"

3003,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"I cannot say that Homer always has hauberks, not corslets of back-plate"

3005,MEN'S DRESS IN HOMER. ARMOUR.,"_gualon_ is pierced over the belly, look as if Homer knew both corslet"

3186,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3187,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"As to the evolution of feminine costume, I speak with the greatest"
3188,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"diffidence. Homer's women wore the loose brooched peplos, with brooch,"
3189,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"pin, clasp, and over it the _pharos_. Women of the later dark age and"
3190,WOMEN'S COSTUME,the Dipylon period apparently dressed otherwise. In the archaic period
3191,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the brooched peplos, girdled at the waist, was worn; but I think that"
3192,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"there was also a revival or survival of Aegean sewn and shaped bodices,"
3193,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"jackets, and skirts. Lastly, historic Greece reverted to the Homeric"
3194,WOMEN'S COSTUME,peplos and _chlaina_.
3195,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3196,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"The discussion is, inevitably, concerned with minutiae in details"
3197,WOMEN'S COSTUME,about which our actual information is far from being minute. We must
3198,WOMEN'S COSTUME,therefore state here explicitly the conclusions to which we are led:
3199,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"namely, that neither the male nor female dress nor the armour described"
3200,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"in the Epics was introduced, at any period, by the Ionians employed"
3201,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"in any one of the four or five ""recensions"" which are postulated by"
3202,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"certain critics, as in the ""first _Iliad_"" of Robert, and his ""second,"
3203,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"third, and fourth _Iliads_""[1] On the other hand, we contend that"
3204,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"both the costume and the armour in Homer are of a single period,"
3205,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"earlier than the Dipylon and barbaric Tirynthian age of art, while"
3206,WOMEN'S COSTUME,historic Greece from the middle of the sixth century began to revert to
3207,WOMEN'S COSTUME,something like the Homeric type.
3208,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3209,WOMEN'S COSTUME,We must remember that hitherto no representations of Homer's people
3210,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"in the free art of the Aegeans have been discovered, and thence no"
3211,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"light can be derived. When the crude art of Tiryns and, later (?) of"
3212,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the ""Geometric"" school of ornament comes into view (1000-800 B.C.?),"
3213,WOMEN'S COSTUME,the designs of men and women are childish. In painted vases which may
3214,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"represent the palsied decadence of the Aegean age, the human figures"
3215,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"are simply absurd, still they are recognisably human; though in vases"
3216,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"of what may be called the ""dotted"" style of outline, they have heads"
3217,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"like birds, as on dotted bronzes of northern Italy in the Early Age"
3218,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"of Iron. In the ""Dipylon"" style, again, as soon as human beings are"
3219,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"represented, the heads of the men are like potatoes set on sticks; the"
3220,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"torso is an inverted isosceles triangle, with the pointed waist for"
3221,WOMEN'S COSTUME,apex; and the naked legs are enormously thick in thighs and calves. The
3222,WOMEN'S COSTUME,women's bodies also are often equilateral triangles; the parts below
3223,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the waist are clothed in tight skirts, as a general rule; the breasts,"
3224,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"when the bust is represented, are either bare, or clad in a very tight"
3225,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"bodice, or are hidden by a hood which falls below the shoulders like"
3226,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"a cape. In one Tirynthian fragment we see a stout lady in a ""princess"
3227,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"frock"" tight, ""of the Menzies tartan,""[2] and all of one piece; another"
3228,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"design shows a waist no thicker than a broomstick[3] (figs. 8, 9)."
3229,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"These costumes of women, in Tirynthian and Dipylon art, are un-Homeric"
3230,WOMEN'S COSTUME,and post-Homeric. I doubt if we find such female costumes as Homer
3231,WOMEN'S COSTUME,apparently describes recognisably represented in Greek art till the
3232,WOMEN'S COSTUME,sixth and fifth centuries.
3233,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3234,WOMEN'S COSTUME,[Illustration: Fig. 8--Princess Frock: Tiryns--_By permission of John
3235,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Murray_, Schliemann's _Tiryns_, plate xxv. c]"
3236,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3237,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"This seems to be stated with unnecessary force, because, it may well be"
3238,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"said, the meaning of the sentence turns on the words ""_recognisably_"
3239,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"represented."" How are we to ""recognise,"" in art, costumes of which"
3240,WOMEN'S COSTUME,Homer gives us only brief verbal descriptions? Are we not deceived by
3241,WOMEN'S COSTUME,the free and vivid style of Homer? All his human beings and gods come
3242,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"in such living forms before us, that we see the flowing, glistening"
3243,WOMEN'S COSTUME,garments of Nausicaa and Athene swaying with their motions. We can see
3244,WOMEN'S COSTUME,nothing like this represented in Greek art till the late sixth century
3245,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"and onwards; because, it may be said, till that date Greek art is hard,"
3246,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"prim, constrained, conventional,--in fact, archaic. It is therefore,"
3247,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"we may be told, a kind of logical illusion which prevents us from"
3248,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"recognising the costumes of Homer's women in Greek plastic art, till"
3249,WOMEN'S COSTUME,that art itself is beginning to attain Homeric freedom.
3250,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3251,WOMEN'S COSTUME,These considerations must be kept in mind. But another error is apt to
3252,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"be suggested when we read that the historic Hellenic costume, or that"
3253,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"part of it styled ""the Doric peplos,"" ""is implied by the allusions"
3254,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"of Homer,"" the view of the ingenious Studniczka.[4] The remark is"
3255,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"illustrated by fig. 10, in which we see a lady in ""a Doric peplos,"""
3256,WOMEN'S COSTUME,though how Achaean women of Homer's time could wear the dress of the
3257,WOMEN'S COSTUME,Dorians whom Homer ignores is not apparent. This graceful and breezy
3258,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"costume is, in fact, like what we suppose Homer to have had in his"
3259,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"mind, and to have seen. But it is not in the least like the dress shown"
3260,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"in the art which is immediately subsequent to his age, the art of"
3261,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Tiryns and of the Dipylon; and, as far as I can ascertain, it is not"
3262,WOMEN'S COSTUME,the costume displayed in the archaic art up to the middle of the sixth
3263,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"century. Archaic Greek female costume, however, has this much in common"
3264,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"with Homeric and later Greek costume, that it essentially differs,"
3265,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"often, from Aegean or Mycenaean dress."
3266,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3267,WOMEN'S COSTUME,In describing the contrast of styles between the pre-Homeric Aegean
3268,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"dress and the Homeric costume for women, Mr. Leaf says that the"
3269,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Mykenaean (Aegean) women wore ""a close fitting bodice, sharply marked"
3270,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"off from the full skirt...""; and though there were many changes of"
3271,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"fashion in the Aegean world, this account holds good for its later"
3272,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"periods. ""The dress of Greek women in historic times is of a totally"
3273,WOMEN'S COSTUME,different kind. It is marked by simplicity and flowing vertical
3274,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"lines.... The peplos is, in fact, no more than a square woollen blanket"
3275,WOMEN'S COSTUME,... taken up round the middle by a girdle and retained in its place on
3276,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the shoulders by pins."" The Aegean female dress, sewn and fitted, did"
3277,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"not need pins or brooches, [Greek: _peronai, enetai, portai_].[5] On"
3278,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the other hand, ""no pins or fibulae have been found among the remains"
3279,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"of the Mykenaean prime,"" while they are common in the latter ""lower"
3280,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"city"" below the acropolis of Mycenae."
3281,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3282,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Mr. Leaf therefore conceives that ""during the prime of Mykene fashion"
3283,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"was dominated by a non-Hellenic influence,"" perhaps Oriental. Bodices"
3284,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"and separate flounced skirts were in, ""but for some reason which we"
3285,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"cannot expect to guess, fashion returned, at the end of the Mykenaean"
3286,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"age, to the older and simpler dress"" (the Homeric), ""which held its"
3287,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"ground till classical times.""[6] The usual explanation is that the"
3288,WOMEN'S COSTUME,fibulae and the pinned peplos were brought in from the north by Achaean
3289,WOMEN'S COSTUME,invaders; in the north the fibulae had long been common;[7] and that
3290,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the style of costume persisted continuously into historic times, being"
3291,WOMEN'S COSTUME,the familiar classical Greek dress.
3292,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3293,WOMEN'S COSTUME,[Illustration: Fig. 9--Costume of Women--Tirynthian Vase By permission
3294,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"of John Murray, Esq. Schliemann's _Tiryns_, plate. xvii. a]"
3295,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3296,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Now undoubtedly the fibula, and therefore the unsewn and unshaped"
3297,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"female attire, did come in at the close of the Aegean or Mycenaean"
3298,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"period in Greece; but, as far as I can interpret the art of very old"
3299,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Tirynthian and some Dipylon vases, there was an early post-Homeric"
3300,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"period wherein women adopted the short hood-capes, the tight waists,"
3301,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the heavy skirts, and the princess frock.[8] This attire more"
3302,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"resembles the Aegean than the Homeric and Hellenic. The ""hood-cape"" of"
3303,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Tirynthian art may conceivably be the [Greek: kreidemnon, kalupira"
3304,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"or Greek: kalumma] of Homer; but if so, it reveals below it a waist"
3305,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"of more than Aegean tightness, not the belted peplos. Such are the"
3306,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"characteristics of Dipylon art, and of Tirynthian art which may"
3307,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"have arisen before 900 B.C. It is hardly possible that if, in that"
3308,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"age, women wore the loose Homeric peplos, the artists should have"
3309,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"represented them with impossibly narrow waists, with the bosom fully"
3310,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"displayed, and with heavy skirts. The women of this dark age, as far as"
3311,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"art can enlighten us, had broken away from, or at all events are not"
3312,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"wearing, the Homeric peplos."
3313,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3314,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"This is, at least, my private interpretation of the Dipylon and the"
3315,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Tirynthian representation. But it is offered with diffidence, and is"
3316,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"not shared by Mr. R. M. Dawkins, the Director of the British School"
3317,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"of Athens. He ""does not believe that the Dipylon women's dress is"
3318,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"necessarily a tight one,"" and attributes the wasp waists to the limited"
3319,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"skill of the early artist, thinking that if he had to draw a woman in"
3320,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"a loose flowing dress he would still give her a tiny waist, because a"
3321,WOMEN'S COSTUME,small waist is one of the conspicuous points in the female figure. In
3322,WOMEN'S COSTUME,the effort to give as much information as possible he would draw the
3323,WOMEN'S COSTUME,small waist even if it were concealed by a loose dress. The primitive
3324,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"artist draws not from models, but from mental images."
3325,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3326,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"There is much truth in this; for example, the ladies in a palaeolithic"
3327,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"rock-painting[9] have very slim waists, clearly exaggerated, above"
3328,WOMEN'S COSTUME,skirts with a crescentine scoop at the bottom. But the primitive artist
3329,WOMEN'S COSTUME,certainly draws under the domination of a convention which differs
3330,WOMEN'S COSTUME,in different places. The woman whose figure is repeated in the clay
3331,WOMEN'S COSTUME,disk from Phaestus[10] has no more waist than the stout person in
3332,WOMEN'S COSTUME,a princess frock from Tiryns. The Dipylon artists may be continuing
3333,WOMEN'S COSTUME,the Aegean convention of the wasp waist; though the designer of the
3334,WOMEN'S COSTUME,princess frock is as candid as the Phaestos artist. Thus the reader
3335,WOMEN'S COSTUME,must interpret the Dipylon waist as he pleases.
3336,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3337,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"We next reach the ""archaic"" art of, say, the seventh to sixth"
3338,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"centuries. The chief article of female dress, as described by Homer,"
3339,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"was the peplos, ""a square or rectangular piece of material which,"""
3340,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"like the men's outer mantle, ""could be used for various purposes."""
3341,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"It was fastened by pins or brooches ([Greek: _peronai, enetai_]),"
3342,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"and the [Greek: _peronè_] was sometimes a fibula or safety pin, the"
3343,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"cover adorned by art, as in the case of the [Greek: _peronè_] of"
3344,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Odysseus (_Od_. xix.). But when (_Iliad_, v. 425) Athene mockingly"
3345,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"tells Zeus that the wounded Aphrodite must have scratched her hand,"
3346,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"while caressing some Achaean woman, on her [Greek: _peronè_], the term"
3347,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"""_safety_ pin,"" or _fibula,_ does not apply. We think rather of one of"
3348,WOMEN'S COSTUME,the long sharp stiletto-like pins found in Egyptian deposits of from
3349,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"about 1450 to 1200 B.C. and also at Enkomi in Cyprus, and at Sparta in"
3350,WOMEN'S COSTUME,the Orthia sanctuary from 900 to 500 B.C.[11] Fibulae of the same date
3351,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"also occur. These great pins had ribbed handles, and below the handle"
3352,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"was a perforation or a metallic loop.[12] Now very long pins, also with"
3353,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"ribbed handles, but without the aperture in the middle, fasten the"
3354,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"peplos of one of the Fates on the Francis vase, which Mr. Evans dates"
3355,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"in ""the seventh century,"" but Mr. Walters--from the characters in the"
3356,WOMEN'S COSTUME,inscriptions on the vase--dates about 570-550 B.C.[13] The Spartan
3357,WOMEN'S COSTUME,evidence for the pin and fibulae covers the later range of dates.
3358,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3359,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Metope of Athene, Olympia _Photo: English"
3360,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Photographic Co., Athens._]"
3361,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3362,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Much turns on the date of the François vase, for many critics, with"
3363,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Studniczka, consider that the costume of the female figures is like"
3364,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"that which Homer's women wear, and is a ""Doric peplos."" Thus Miss"
3365,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Abrahams, in her Greek Dress (1908, pp. 29, 30) studies the arraying of"
3366,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Hera.[14] Of her dress Homer says, [Greek: chryseiês d'eneteisi kata"
3367,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"stuthos peronato]: ""And she fastened it _over her breast_ with clasps"
3368,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"of gold."" ""We gather from this passage,"" says Miss Abrahams, ""that the"
3369,WOMEN'S COSTUME,garment was fastened _on the shoulders_ by brooches or pins inserted
3370,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"[Greek: kata stuthos], which Studniczka rightly interprets as '_down"
3371,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"towards the breast_,' a method of fastening which is represented on the"
3372,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"François vase and elsewhere."" ""The material,"" Miss Abrahams goes on,"
3373,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"""is drawn from the back, and wraps over that which covers the front,"
3374,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"_the pins are then inserted downwards_, and hold the two thicknesses of"
3375,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"material together...."""
3376,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3377,WOMEN'S COSTUME,But (see fig. 11) the pins are inserted _upwards_; we observe the
3378,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"long ribbed head of the pin, of known form like that of the 1450-1200"
3379,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"B.C. pins of Egypt and Enkomi, stuck into the fabric above the right"
3380,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"breast. It penetrates the fabric, and passes upwards into a large oval"
3381,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"shoulder piece, perhaps the tail of the piece of cloth which covers"
3382,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the decorated collar over the shoulder-joint. The Homeric phrase ""pins"
3383,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"inserted _down towards_ the _breast_"" does not indicate this mode of"
3384,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"fastening, which is _upwards from_ the breast. ""A method practically"
3385,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"impossible--the pin would fall out,"" says Mr. Dawkins. ""If so, blame"
3386,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the artist."" Neither the ""overfold"" ([Greek: apoptugma]) nor the"
3387,WOMEN'S COSTUME,curious oval piece on the shoulder-joint (perhaps a portion of the
3388,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"fabric) is mentioned by Homer. Again, when we read,[15] ""the dress"
3389,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"is held into the figure by a girdle worn round the waist, over which"
3390,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"any superfluous length of material could be drawn, forming a [Greek:"
3391,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"kolpos] or pouch,"" we must remember that in the dress on the François"
3392,WOMEN'S COSTUME,vase _there is no superfluous material_. The dress ends just above the
3393,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"heels, there is no ""tunic-trailing""; as in Homer. A woman who drew her"
3394,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"dress up to form a [Greek: kolpos] or pouch, would show much more of"
3395,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"her legs than was fashionable in the archaic period, and would destroy"
3396,WOMEN'S COSTUME,the collant fit over the breast. The costume fits tightly to the bust;
3397,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"and in art of 600-550 B.C. this is the rule. We see no women ""with deep"
3398,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"[Greek: kolpos] or pouch,"" whereas the nurse of Eumaeus could conceal"
3399,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"three cups in her pouch. Here, again, Mr. Dawkins thinks that the"
3400,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"limitations of the artist cause the absence of the _kolpos_. ""He made"
3401,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"any dress look tight, because he could only draw his idea of the body"
3402,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"and then indicate dress on the body. The artist has two mental images,"
3403,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"one of the natural body and the other of the dress, and he could only"
3404,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"carry out his work by combining the two."""
3405,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3406,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"But I must reply that, in the François vase, we are far from the"
3407,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"""primitive"" artist. The artist knows very well what he is about. He"
3408,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"draws short skirts and over the bust the dress is _collant_, because"
3409,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"that is the fashion. The painter no longer draws impossible waists,"
3410,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"they are in good proportion for girls. Moreover, artists of the same"
3411,WOMEN'S COSTUME,period when they design a woman in a mantle do so in the modern way.
3412,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"The bust is indicated; the mantle does not cover it, but covers the"
3413,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"waist, and no attempt is made to show what the artist knows is there:"
3414,WOMEN'S COSTUME,he does not design what is not in sight. Even an Australian black
3415,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"fellow drew what he saw, not what he knew was there, in sketches"
3416,WOMEN'S COSTUME,of white ladies.[16] We must not explain the François vase by the

3421,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3422,WOMEN'S COSTUME,My impression is that in the eighth to seventh centuries women still
3423,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"did, at least occasionally, wear a costume consisting, as in Aegean"
3424,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"times, of separate bodices and skirts. Thus in an archaic Corinthian"
3425,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"gold jewel we see an Ariadne naked from the belt upwards, beneath is"
3426,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"a skirt falling to the instep. Skirts were therefore separate, and"
3427,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"imply a separate bodice, if the upper body is to be covered[17] (fig."
3428,WOMEN'S COSTUME,12).
3429,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3430,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Ariadne, Theseus, and Minotaur From a"
3431,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Corinthian Gold Ornament From _Arch. Ztg._., 1884]"
3432,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3433,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"The pouch is Homeric, but in art of 600-550 B.C. no woman, as far as I"
3434,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"have observed, has any ""superfluous length of material,"" or, at least,"
3435,WOMEN'S COSTUME,almost none draws it up through the girdle to form such a pouch as
3436,WOMEN'S COSTUME,we see on Miss Abrahams's fig. 10 (Metope from the temple of Zeus at
3437,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Olympia). The wearer could hide the family plate in her pouch, not so"
3438,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the women of the Francois vase. Such a costume cannot be called, as a"
3439,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"rule, [Greek: tanupeplos], or [Greek: elkesipeplos], ""trailing robed,"""
3440,WOMEN'S COSTUME,like Homer's women.
3441,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3442,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Thus the Greek dress of the seventh to sixth century, when many artists"
3443,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"drew what they saw under no ""primitive"" limitations, is not Homeric."
3444,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Homeric female dress is loose and flowing, and trailing. Archaic Greek"
3445,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"female dress is tight, not flowing, not trailing. Historic Hellenic"
3446,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"female dress is loose, flowing, and trailing; it returns to the Homeric"
3447,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"type. In holding these opinions we are not, then, deluded by the"
3448,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"freedom of Homer's art; he insists on the _kolpos_, or loose fold which"
3449,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"makes a pouch, and on the trailing loose peplos; nor, at least in my"
3450,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"opinion, are we deluded by the stiffness of archaic art, which really"
3451,WOMEN'S COSTUME,represents the brevity and tightness of the prevailing fashion.
3452,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3453,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Thus we cannot cite the François vase ""in illustration of the Homeric"
3454,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"peplos.""[18] The François dress is not trailing, nor is it pouched,"
3455,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"nor is it Homeric. A thick, round, embroidered collar with no apparent"
3456,WOMEN'S COSTUME,breach in its continuity is either pinned or sewn over the François
3457,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"peplos, and the overlap is tight enough to indicate the bust very"
3458,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"gracefully. Moreover, the costume of Athene[19] is not that of the"
3459,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"François vase (fig. 13). _Both_, I think, cannot be ""the closed Doric"
3460,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"dress."" Athene has a garment much more flowing than that of the"
3461,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"François dress; and, unlike that costume, it has a pouch, though her"
3462,WOMEN'S COSTUME,dress falls rather lower than that of the François ladies; and she
3463,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"has no thick collar, and no long pins thrust up from the breast.[20]"
3464,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Athene's dress would be long and trailing, if it were not drawn up"
3465,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"through the girdle. By the date of the Olympian figure of Athene, Greek"
3466,WOMEN'S COSTUME,female dress had moved back from the fashion of the François costume
3467,WOMEN'S COSTUME,towards that which Homer knew and described.
3468,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3469,WOMEN'S COSTUME,We now reach the strange story which Herodotus tells to account for the
3470,WOMEN'S COSTUME,alleged enforced change of Athenian women's costume from the peplos
3471,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"fastened with long stiletto-like pins, as in the François vase (an"
3472,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Athenian work of art), to the Ionic dress, which had no long pins."
3473,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"The women, he says, slew, with their long pins, a messenger who bore"
3474,WOMEN'S COSTUME,the tale of the massacre of their husbands; and the men therefore
3475,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"compelled them to wear the Ionian linen chiton, which does not require"
3476,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the [Greek: _peronè_], the stiletto pin.[21] The event was of the first"
3477,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"half of the sixth century; 568 B.C. is the date conjectured, which"
3478,WOMEN'S COSTUME,tallies fairly with Mr. Walters's dating of the François vase made
3479,WOMEN'S COSTUME,while long pins were still fashionable. But if the wearing of Ionic
3480,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"costume were, as Miss Abrahams supposes, one of the luxuries which"
3481,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Solon (594 B.C.) tried to check, then we must date the François vase in"
3482,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the seventh century. Yet the costume of the vase, with its expensive"
3483,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"embroideries, is much more ""luxurious"" than the linen Ionian chiton or"
3484,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"smock. In any case it is certain, from the dangerous long pins of, say,"
3485,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"1200 B.C. at Enkomi and in Greek deposits in Egypt, that women wore"
3486,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"these stiletto pins five centuries before they did so at Athens, in,"
3487,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"say, 620-560 B.C. So Homer had his mind, when Aphrodite scratched her"
3488,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"hand with an Achaean woman's pin, on Achaean female dress, not on that"
3489,WOMEN'S COSTUME,of Athenians of the seventh or sixth century.

3493,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3494,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"In short, Homeric female dress was not introduced into the Epics by any"
3495,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"""recension,"" by any interpolators of any post-Achaean date, as Pinza"
3496,WOMEN'S COSTUME,argues that it was.[22] He supposes the Ionian female costume to be a
3497,WOMEN'S COSTUME,long linen smock with short sleeves.
3498,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3499,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Pinza argues that the costume of women in Homer ""is wholly different"
3500,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"from that of Spartan ladies of archaic and classical times; and, on the"
3501,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"other hand, exhibits many analogies with the more antique linen chiton"
3502,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"with short sleeves, certainly of Asiatico-Semitic origin, as is proved"
3503,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"by the etymology of the name"" (chiton).[23] He supposes the Ionian"
3504,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"costume of women, described as a long linen smock with short sleeves,"
3505,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"to be derived, through Phoenicia, from the Syria of, say, 690 B.C.,"
3506,WOMEN'S COSTUME,citing Hebrew female captives in Layard's _Monuments of Nineveh_ (i.
3507,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"plates 61, 83, and others). In plate 61 we see a tall female captive,"
3508,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"wearing a long garment, with a broad fringe over her head, and below it"
3509,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"another long garment with short tight sewn sleeves, and a broad border"
3510,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"which falls over the legs, leaving them bare from the calf. There are"
3511,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"no pins or fibulae visible; the upper garment hides the girdle, if"
3512,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"girdle there be. In plate 65 two figures of goddesses are carried, on"
3513,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"chairs, in a procession. They wear long sewn smocks, with sewn sleeves"
3514,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"ending above the elbows, and with very broad belts. The dresses end"
3515,WOMEN'S COSTUME,above the ankle bones. They are far from being loose or trailing; no
3516,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"pins or fibulae appear. The same costume, without any girdle, is worn"
3517,WOMEN'S COSTUME,by two women in a kitchen: they seem to have bodices and skirts (plate
3518,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"30). The sleeves have no small round brooches like the Ionian chiton,"
3519,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"which, like the Assyrian dresses, reached the feet ([Greek: podeireis])."
3520,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3521,WOMEN'S COSTUME,Miss Abrahams remarks that it is a mistake to suppose the Doric chiton
3522,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"to have been always fastened by pins or brooches, the Ionic always"
3523,WOMEN'S COSTUME,sewn on the shoulders (like those quoted from Assyrian monuments).
3524,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"In many Greek works of art, a chiton, clearly Ionic, is not sewn on"
3525,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the shoulders, but fastened down the upper arm by a series of small"
3526,WOMEN'S COSTUME,brooches.[24] The Assyrian dresses often answer to the Ionic chiton
3527,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"as thus described, but are _without any brooches_; and they are much"
3528,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"shorter than the Ionic chiton, which, as thus described, is always"
3529,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"longer than the height of the wearer; ""the superfluous length is"
3530,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"drawn up through the girdle to form a _kolpos_, which varies in depth"
3531,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"according to the length of the chiton.""[25] Not so in archaic Greek"
3532,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"art! In any case, the Ionic dress as described is much longer than that"
3533,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"of the Assyrian designs, has a kolpos, where they have none, and may"
3534,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"either be sewn, like them, over the shoulder, or, unlike them, may be"
3535,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"fastened over the upper arm with small brooches. Thus the Ionic, _as"
3536,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"described_, is not the same as the Syrian, when the Ionic has brooches;"
3537,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"nor is it, in my opinion the female costume of the Greek vases of the"
3538,WOMEN'S COSTUME,seventh and early sixth centuries.
3539,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3540,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"In Layard's plate 67 A, from the Assyrian monuments, we see two of the"
3541,WOMEN'S COSTUME,captive women from Lachish kneeling and giving suck to their children.
3542,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Their smocks are tight, girdled, and reach the heels. The dress of"
3543,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the upper woman has short sleeves on both arms, and the line where"
3544,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"it crosses below the neck is perfectly well marked. How the infant,"
3545,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"in these circumstances, reaches the natural source of nourishment is"
3546,WOMEN'S COSTUME,a deep mystery. In the figure of the lower woman certain faint lines
3547,WOMEN'S COSTUME,appear to indicate that the dress has been opened at the centre of the
3548,WOMEN'S COSTUME,neck and drawn aside over one breast. In neither case is there any
3549,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"trace of fibula, pin, button, or hook and eye, or loose hanging flap."
3550,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3551,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Pinza, however,[26] finds here an exact parallel to Hera's peplos in"
3552,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"_Iliad_, xiv. 175, ""fastened over her breast with clasps of gold,"""
3553,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"that is, ""fastened on the shoulders by brooches or pins inserted down"
3554,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"towards the breast""; and this, again, is said to be illustrated (as"
3555,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"above) by the François vase. In answer, it may suffice to look at the"
3556,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"two pictures, Layard 67 A and the Fates on the François vase. A simple"
3557,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"button and button-hole, as Pinza remarks, in the dress below the centre"
3558,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"of the neck, would, if withdrawn, do all that these Hebrew babies need."
3559,WOMEN'S COSTUME,A man may illustrate this for himself by opening his shirt at the
3560,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"collar stud. The lower Hebrew woman might even be naked above the belt,"
3561,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"like the kneeling woman just beneath her, were it not for the line of"
3562,WOMEN'S COSTUME,her dress across her neck. She has no sleeves. There is no sign of any
3563,WOMEN'S COSTUME,openings at the shoulders or _precisaménte come l' [Greek: eanos] della
3564,WOMEN'S COSTUME,Epopea_.
3565,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3566,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"These Assyrian designs do not, it seems to me, encourage the opinion"
3567,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"that Hebrew female costume of the date of Hezekiah, say, 690 B.C.,"
3568,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"was thrust into Homer about that period, at an Ionian ""recension,"""
3569,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"and remained there unaltered by later ""recensions.""[27] The brooched"
3570,WOMEN'S COSTUME,costume of Homeric women is not the sewn costume of the Assyrian art.
3571,WOMEN'S COSTUME,Other Hebrew ladies from Lachish wear the long piece of cloth over
3572,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"their heads, falling to the top of the ankle, and under that a tight"
3573,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"smock of the same length. There is no girdle, the arms are bare, no"
3574,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"fibulae are shown.[28] As the Syrian female costume never shows brooch,"
3575,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"pin, or fibula, it certainly cannot be the origin of the Homeric or the"
3576,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Doric peplos, or of the brooched historical costume of Hellas."
3577,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3578,WOMEN'S COSTUME,Meanwhile a mere untutored man who looks at the Fates on the François
3579,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"vase thinks, I find, that the embroidered overlap is simply a short"
3580,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"jacket worn over the peplos, This appears to be an error. But I had,"
3581,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"as an amateur, come to the conclusion that the dress of the women"
3582,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"in archaic Greek art often consists of sewn bodice and skirt, or of"
3583,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"a tight jacket with a separate skirt, not of the peplos. Mr. Myres"
3584,WOMEN'S COSTUME,had already expressed similar opinions as to the late survival (or
3585,WOMEN'S COSTUME,revival?) of that Aegean costume.[29]
3586,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3587,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Moreover, Mr. Walters, judging from vase-paintings, says, ""The Ionic"
3588,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"costume is introduced about 500 B.C., but its vogue does not seem to"
3589,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"have lasted long at Athens.""[30]"
3590,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3591,WOMEN'S COSTUME,Perdrizet thought that the archaic costume more resembled the Mycenaean
3592,WOMEN'S COSTUME,(or Aegean) than the Doric style; while Mr. Wace (in the catalogue of
3593,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"the museum at Sparta), Mr. Leaf, Mr. Dawkins, and others hold that the"
3594,WOMEN'S COSTUME,archaic dress is merely a long chiton tied at the waist. This question
3595,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"of the late survival, or revival, of non-Homeric Aegean female costume"
3596,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"is thus delicate and obscure, though I have little or no doubt that it"
3597,WOMEN'S COSTUME,did in many cases survive or was revived.
3598,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3599,WOMEN'S COSTUME,The woman in the archaic sepulchral monument from Etruria (British
3600,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Museum) wears a short jacket, and a very brief skirt; and a woman in"
3601,WOMEN'S COSTUME,a leaden figurine of Sparta wears only a girdle and a kirtle. She is
3602,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"running, and has thrown off her jacket or bodice. An archaic Victory, a"
3603,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"terra cotta in the British Museum, wears only a very short skirt.[31]"
3604,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"The Ariadne of an archaic Corinthian jewel, in a belted skirt, with no"
3605,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"bodice, has already been cited."
3606,WOMEN'S COSTUME,
3607,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"Thus the evidence of art, in the dark period of, say, 900-700 B.C.,"
3608,WOMEN'S COSTUME,inclines me to believe that women sometimes wore shaped and sewn
3609,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"bodices and skirts, or jackets and skirts; sometimes a strait brooched"
3610,WOMEN'S COSTUME,"and girdled peplos, not flowing, not trailing, not Homeric; that there"
3611,WOMEN'S COSTUME,was none of the Homeric uniformity of attire. Varieties of fashion are
3612,WOMEN'S COSTUME,not discordant with feminine nature.

3730,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,in fact it was in the period to which we may assign Homer.[5] Other

3737,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,
3738,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,Now Homer describes this period of gradual overlap of iron and bronze.
3739,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,"But he adds the strange peculiarity that the weapons, but for a single"

3744,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,"critics mentioned in the note below, Helbig and Cauer think that the"
3745,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,steady mention by Homer of bronze for weapons is a mere tradition of
3746,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,"the epic, maintained by poets in the Iron Age. It would be interesting"
3747,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,to find any such tradition in any other literature of the early Iron
3748,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,"Age. But we do not find it. Moreover, the lays of the Bronze Age, when"
3749,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,"they mentioned tools, must have said that they were of bronze, as Homer"
3750,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,occasionally does; but we are not told why later poets maintained
3751,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,"the bronze tradition for weapons, but spoke of tools as iron. As in"
3752,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,"the case of the arrow-head it is called ""the iron,"" so in the case of"
3753,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,"tools, and of knives (not used in battle); the wheelwright is said to"

3763,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,"Naber and Bérard, unlike Cauer and Helbig, give the obvious explanation"

3801,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,that never existed. The relative uses of excellent bronze for spears
3802,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,"and swords, and of dubious iron for implements, were perfectly natural."
3803,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,Homer probably saw this stage in actual life; nobody could invent

3814,BRONZE AND IRON. WEAPONS AND TOOLS,"the age when iron is, at least, the dominant if not the only metal for"

4023,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4024,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4025,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,The most perplexing questions in Homer's picture of life are connected
4026,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"with the disposal of the dead. It is just here, where archaeology as"
4027,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"a rule gives the surest evidence from the examination of graves, that"
4028,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,archaeology so far seems to fail us. Yet Homer speaks with no uncertain
4029,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,voice. From the fifty-second line of the first book of the _Iliad_ to
4030,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"the funeral of Hector in the twenty-fourth book, Homer always tells of"
4031,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"cremation, ""and ever the pyres of the dead burned in multitude."" There"
4032,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"may be slight variations in practice, as regards burning his armour"
4033,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"with the dead warrior; and the funeral of Patroclus, in which the love"
4034,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"and the rage of Achilles expended themselves, has features not usually"
4035,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"recorded by Homer,--the circumstances being peculiar,--but there is"
4036,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"always cremation, always the urn-burial of the bones, always the cairn"
4037,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,piled above them with its pillar on the summit; yet no such Homeric
4038,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,cairn has yet been discovered.
4039,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4040,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"Yet Homer certainly describes no invented rites: cremation, urn-burial,"
4041,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"the linen wrapping of the urn (gold, bronze, or of pottery), and the"
4042,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,cairn are familiar from remains of the Bronze and early Iron Age in
4043,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,northern and central Europe: the custom in our islands appears to have
4044,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"survived the dawn of Christianity, and is perfectly well remembered by"
4045,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"the Christian author of the Anglo-Saxon epic, _Beowulf_. Contrasting"
4046,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"pagan times with his own, he writes: ""Woe is his who is destined,"
4047,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"through savage hate, _to thrust his soul into the fire's embrace, to"
4048,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"hope for no comfort, in no wise to change_."""
4049,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4050,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"""Weal is his who may after his death-day stand before the Lord, and"
4051,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"claim a refuge in the Father's arms.""[1]"
4052,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4053,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"This burial by fire, this want of hope, this changeless, helpless"
4054,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"future, are what Achilles endured and deplored.[2] ""Rather would I"
4055,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"on earth be the hind of a landless man than king over all the dead."""
4056,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"Thus the dying Beowulf asks to be buried: ""Bid ye the warriors raise"
4057,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,a far-seen cairn for me after the funeral fire on a head-land by the
4058,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,sea ... so that seafarers who drive their tall ships over the spray of
4059,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"ocean shall thereafter call it _Beowulf's barrow_.""[3]"
4060,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4061,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"So, too, spoke the ghost of Elpenor on the limit of Oceanus to"
4062,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"Odysseus: ""Burn me with my armour, all that is mine, and pile for me a"
4063,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"cairn by the shore of the grey sea, memorial of a luckless man, that"
4064,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"men unborn may inquire of me.""[4] The customs and ideas are identical,"
4065,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"but no such cairns have we found in Homeric lands, whereas they are"
4066,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,common in our islands.
4067,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4068,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,Meanwhile the burial customs of the Aegean folk in Crete and in Greece
4069,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"were not those known to Homer. They used ""shaft-graves,"" deeply sunk"
4070,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"in earth, luckily for us, since in these were found the unsunned"
4071,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"treasures of Mycenae. They also used ""chamber-tombs,"" and ""pit-graves,"""
4072,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"and stone-built _tholos_ chambers, beehive shaped, not cairns of earth"
4073,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"covering a small chamber of stone. They did not, in the Bronze Age,"
4074,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"burn the dead, but buried him, often in a large _larnax_ or coffer"
4075,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"of pottery; and they deposited rich grave-goods, which Homer never"
4076,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,mentions. In a chamber-tomb at Muliana in Crete were found unburned
4077,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"bones with weapons of bronze, and an Aegean ""false-necked vase"";"
4078,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"while hard by in the same chamber were ""cremated bones, in a cinerary"
4079,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"geometric urn,"" and an iron sword and dagger.[5]"
4080,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4081,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"""Here,"" says Mr. Evans, ""we have the interesting spectacle of the"
4082,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"succession of corpse-burial by cremation, and of iron weapons by"
4083,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"bronze, apparently without any break in the indigenous stock."" The"
4084,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,Aegean Bronze Age of burial passes into the Iron Age of cremation.
4085,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,About the change of custom without change of stock or race we cannot
4086,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"be quite certain, but cremation makes its appearance in association"
4087,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"with iron weapons, which Homer's men do not use, while they do practise"
4088,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"cremation and cairn-burial, which has left no known traces in the"
4089,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,Bronze Age of Greece.
4090,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4091,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"It is suggested by Mr. Murray, as by Helbig, that cremation was"
4092,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"adopted, during the dark age of the Migrations, by men who wished to"
4093,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"burn their dead ""into their ultimate dust,"" that the dust might not"
4094,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"be violated by hostile hands. The custom, Mr. Murray suggests, was"
4095,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"a revival of what the Northerners had used ""in the forest country"
4096,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"from which they came."" Possibly if wood were very scarce in Crete"
4097,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"and Greece, the Northerners there might adopt the local method of"
4098,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"burial, and revert to their own custom at Troy, where Ida furnished"
4099,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,forests. But Homer supposes cremation and caim-burial to be universal
4100,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,in Greece; and his whole theory of the future life rests on cremation.
4101,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"The rite admits the dead to the House of Hades, ineffectual shadows,"
4102,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"unfed, unfeared, unworshipped; and from the House of Hades they never"
4103,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"return. By the eighth century, and so on continuously, ghosts _can_"
4104,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"appear to men, and are fed, feared, and worshipped, as they had been"
4105,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"in Aegean times. The belief of Homer is the belief of Israel, Hades"
4106,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,is the Sheol of Samuel. The manners of ancient Israel are of interest
4107,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,as regards cremation. The Philistines treated the corpse of Saul as
4108,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"Hector meant to treat that of Patroclus, whose head he would have set"
4109,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"on a spike above the wall of Troy. ""They fastened Saul's body to the"
4110,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"wall of Beth-shan."" His sons' corpses were used in the same way, but"
4111,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"were rescued by valiant Israelites, who burned the bones and buried"
4112,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,them under a tree. This appears to have been done for the purpose of
4113,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,concealing the bones from further outrage. No cairn is mentioned.[6]
4114,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"But cremation, in the case of kings at least, appears to have persisted"
4115,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"in Israel and Judah. Asa, king of Judah, when he died, was ""laid in"
4116,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices;
4117,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"and they made a very great burning for him."" His tomb he had caused to"
4118,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,be digged for him; there his bones were laid.[7] Of Jehoram we read
4119,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"that ""his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his"
4120,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"forefathers.""[8] Jeremiah prophesies for Zedekiah: ""Thou shalt die in"
4121,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"peace: and with the burnings of thy forefathers, the former kings which"
4122,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee.""[9] In Israel an"
4123,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,unusual lack of interest in the future life accompanied cremation of
4124,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"kings, if cremated they were; but the commentators prefer to believe"
4125,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"that they were not, and that only odorous substances and ""furniture"""
4126,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,were burned. Why burn furniture?[10] But Homer's faith is unique in
4127,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"Greece, Aegean or historic it represents a single age of culture--which"
4128,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,has left no material proof of its existence.
4129,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4130,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,Homer's burial rites cannot have arisen out of a practice adopted
4131,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"during the Migrations, for no people that wished to conceal the"
4132,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,resting-place of their dead would raise above it a conspicuous cairn
4133,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"and pillar, for the very purpose of keeping the dead in perpetual"
4134,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,memory. Such cairns would merely have invited desecration during the
4135,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,Migrations.[11]
4136,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4137,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,I can only conclude that Homer describes what is certainly an actual
4138,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"and widely-diffused non-Aegean mode of burial, with the equally"
4139,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,non-Aegean and non-historic belief about the future life. Why the
4140,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"practice has left no material traces, as of cairns, is an insoluble"
4141,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"question at present.[12] The historical Hellenes, however, knew many"
4142,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"tombs, probably barrows or cairns, which they assigned to men and"
4143,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"women of the Heroic Age. Pausanias often mentions such tombs, which he"
4144,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"saw, but he does not usually describe them. In a few cases he speaks"
4145,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"of barrows or cairns of earth, as at Epidaurus the grave of Phocus,"
4146,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"slain by Peleus. It was a ""mound of earth, and on it a rough stone."""
4147,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"At Olympia was the tomb of Oenomaus, ""a piled up mound, with stones"""
4148,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"(vi. 21. 3). At Pergamus beyond Caicus, the grave of Auge, ""a mound of"
4149,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"earth with a stone wall round it"" (viii. 4-9). The grave of Aepytus"
4150,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"(mentioned in _Iliad_, ii. 604), ""a pile of earth, not very high,"
4151,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"surrounded by a coping of stone"" (viii. 16. 3). The tomb of Homer's"
4152,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"Areithous of the iron mace was near Mantinea in Arcadia; it is ""a tomb"
4153,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"with a stone base"" (viii. 11). The attribution of the graves to known"
4154,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,heroes may often have been fanciful; in many cases two or more have
4155,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"claimed one hero's grave. While the belief in heroes existed, barrows"
4156,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"would not be robbed. Pausanias speaks, however, twice of cinerary"
4157,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"urns containing heroic ashes of Ariadne at Argos (ii. 23. 8), and of"
4158,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"Eurytus, son of Melaneus; but here a dream warned Pausanias to be"
4159,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,silent about the urn of bronze (iv. 33).
4160,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4161,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"Thus there were cairns enough, believed to be of heroic and pre-Homeric"
4162,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,date.
4163,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4164,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"It has been suggested that the elaborate enclosure of circles of stone,"
4165,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"with a coping, round the shaft-graves of the acropolis of Mycenae, was"
4166,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,originally meant to contain a barrow of earth. But several grave-stones
4167,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,were found in the earth; and it is unlikely that a barrow would be
4168,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"heaped over the grave-pillars, or that so many would be set up on the"
4169,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"top of a barrow. The cairn seems to be Homeric, not ""Mycenaean."""
4170,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4171,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,Historic Greece had no one orthodox belief as to the condition of
4172,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"departed souls. Homer has, on the other hand, an orthodoxy; the"
4173,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,ghost of the man who does not receive due burning and burial is an
4174,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"outcast, perhaps a mischievous outcast from the company in the halls"
4175,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"of Hades and in the meads of asphodel, while _they_ are but shadows of"
4176,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"themselves, unfed, unless some bold adventurer goes to them and sheds"
4177,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,the blood of the black ram. _That_ was another thing than pouring
4178,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,libations into the tomb.
4179,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4180,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,Considering the fact that phantasms of the dead are probably as common
4181,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"in one age as in another, Homer is singularly free from superstition"
4182,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,about them. Even Lucretius did not deny that such apparitions appear;
4183,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"he tried to explain their appearance as traces left, somehow, on"
4184,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"something, we know not what or how, a theory lately revived. Homer"
4185,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"denies ghosts; and his view, we may say, can never, in his own time,"
4186,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"have been _popular_: it is the view of a class, not of a people."
4187,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4188,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"But, as Mr. Leaf justly observes, there are vestiges in Homer of other"
4189,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"rites than his own. The word [Greek: tarchuein], to preserve, whether"
4190,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"by embalment, or merely by drying or kippering, is used, in a general"
4191,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"sense, for doing all the rites of the dead.[13] The word may survive"
4192,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"from an age when mummification, not cremation, was the rule; honey"
4193,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,may have been employed; and the pots of honey and of oil placed by
4194,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,Achilles against the bier of Patroclus may represent a faint vestige
4195,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"of survival.[14] The usage lasted at Athens, the pointed lekythoi were"
4196,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"ranged round the bier. Why Achilles slew two dogs and four horses,"
4197,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"and threw them on the pyre, he did not know himself; he thought that"
4198,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,he slaughtered twelve Trojan prisoners merely in anger.[15] He had no
4199,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"conscious purpose to send horses, dogs, and thralls into Hades for the"
4200,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"use of his friend; he did not burn the arms of his friend. In _Iliad_,"
4201,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"xxiv. 595, he promises to Patroclus a share of the ransom of Hector's"
4202,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,body; but all these things are spoken of only in connection with the
4203,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,passion of Achilles. Customs almost forgotten revive or are reinvented
4204,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"in the mind of the hero, extravagances of grief and anger."
4205,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4206,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,There is a variation in the last book of the _Odyssey_; the souls of
4207,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"the unburied Wooers arrive among the dead in Hades, though their bodies"
4208,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"are unburned. The passage is usually reckoned late, and these spirits"
4209,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,are under the special guidance of Hermes.
4210,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,
4211,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"Even in these shadowy matters, Homer presents a view' unusually"
4212,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"consistent; and the view was not held either in Aegean times, or in"
4213,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"""Dipylon"" days, or in the eighth century by the Cyclic poets, or in"
4214,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"historic Greece. In this, as in all things, the world of Homer stands"
4215,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,apart. There is possibly one note of change in Homeric burial. The
4216,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"phrase [Greek: kterea ktereiksai], as in _Iliad_, xxiv. 38, means the"
4217,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,burning of some of a man's possessions on his funeral pyre. It occurs
4218,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"but once in the _Iliad_, in the case of the funeral of Hector; but"
4219,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"frequently in the _Odyssey_, about the funeral rites of Odysseus, if he"
4220,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,proves to have died abroad. The only possessions of Patroclus which are
4221,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"burned are dogs and horses; not his arms, as in the cases of Eetion and"
4222,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"Elpenor. In these cases, perhaps, a slight variation in burial rites"
4223,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"may be detected. It looks as though, in the cases where the arms of"
4224,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"the dead are burned with them, they were expected to be of use to them"
4225,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"in the future life, as to Melissa, wife of Periander, who was cold in"
4226,BURIAL AND THE FUTURE LIFE,"Hades, because her wardrobe had not been burned."

4355,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","much earlier and nearer to Aegean times, in Homer, the goddess, as"
4356,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","Artemis, shows her later and more truly Hellenic aspects, and is the"
4357,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","chaste sister of Apollo. Indeed, the Homeric Olympians are already"
4358,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","the beautiful beings which the best art of the Hellenic prime, in the"
4359,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","fifth century, delighted to represent; while in art much earlier than"
4360,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","Pheidias, but much later than Homer, the gods still appear in their"
4361,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL",old Aegean forms. This is the paradox of Homer. The poet lived while
4362,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","the Hellenes were but a small nation, occupying a narrow region in"
4363,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","Thessaly; but his poems forestall the beauty which blossomed again,"
4364,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL",when art and religion were truly Hellenic. And in Homer the beauty
4365,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL",bears none of the barbaric strains that deface the rites of Athens in
4366,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","her glory. ""Homer's portrait of Artemis,"" says Mr. Farnell, ""gives us"
4367,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","not the first but the last point in the development of her character,"
4368,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL",and the conception of her in later Greek literature is not more
4369,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","advanced or more spiritual than his."" But ""Arcadian and Athenian rites"
4370,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","and legends"" (we may compare Boeotian and Spartan art of 800-700 B.C.)"
4371,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","""provide us with testimony much earlier than Homer's.""[10]"
4372,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL",
4373,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","How are we to explain the facts? Homer is the poet of Achaeans,"
4374,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","regarded as a stronger but less civilised race, invaders of a more"
4375,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","civilised people. Yet this Achaean people, or their poet, is already"
4376,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","on the highest Hellenic level in his conception of the Olympians,"
4377,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL",while the practical ritual and legends of Athens in her glorious prime
4378,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL",retain many traces of barbarous and even savage conceptions at which
4379,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","Homer seldom glances, though even in his mythology there are hints of a"
4380,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","truly barbarous cosmogony, the revolution by which Zeus overthrew more"
4381,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","ancient divinities. Homer knew Hesiod's myth of Cronos,[11] which is"
4382,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","precisely that of the Maoris. How then did his taste, and that of his"
4383,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","audience, arrive at his beautiful portraits of the Olympians?"
4384,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL",
4385,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL",This is the great problem. The gods of Aegean art are strange if
4386,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","impressive beings, mixed up with tree- and pillar-worship. Their"
4387,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","altars, in art, are not adapted for sacrifices for animals, but"
4388,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","libations, fruits, and flowers are offered. The gods and goddesses of"
4389,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","archaic Greek art are barbaric and unimpressive, and trees and stones,"
4390,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","as sacred, endured through all Greek history. The Olympians of Homer"
4391,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","are, on the other hand, the Olympians of Pheidias."
4392,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL",
4393,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","Turning from Aegean religion before Homer, which shows infinitely"
4394,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","more of the worship of high gods than of ghosts, we find, in early"

4396,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","ghost-worship, ignored by Homer, is prevalent. From the seventh century"

4399,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","cities. Finally, living men are freely divinised. Thus chthonic as"
4400,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","distinct from Olympian worship, while it is ignored by Homer (whose"
4401,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL",theory of the state of the dead renders it impossible) gets practically

4539,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL",nearest approach to this treatment of sacred beings may perhaps be
4540,"RELIGION IN GREECE: PRE-HISTORIC, HOMERIC, AND HISTORICAL","found in the broad waggeries of our late English mystery plays, like"

4967,TEMPLES. ALTARS. RITUAL. PURIFICATION,The idea at the root of the purification of a man-slayer by a bath

4969,TEMPLES. ALTARS. RITUAL. PURIFICATION,"""sympathetic magic"" of new blood, but that the swine's blood poured"
4970,TEMPLES. ALTARS. RITUAL. PURIFICATION,"over him throws the avenging ghost of his victim off his scent,"
4971,TEMPLES. ALTARS. RITUAL. PURIFICATION,confusing the trail; or that the angry ghost accepts the pig's blood
4972,TEMPLES. ALTARS. RITUAL. PURIFICATION,washed from the slayer as atonement. Plato says that the myth held that
4973,TEMPLES. ALTARS. RITUAL. PURIFICATION,the ghost of the victim communicates its own uneasy emotions to the
4974,TEMPLES. ALTARS. RITUAL. PURIFICATION,"slayer, telepathically.[23] Scores of savage and one or two Hellenic"
4975,TEMPLES. ALTARS. RITUAL. PURIFICATION,"practices aim at actually disarming or mutilating the avenging ghost,"
4976,TEMPLES. ALTARS. RITUAL. PURIFICATION,by binding or dismembering the corpse which he tenanted. Homer believes
4977,TEMPLES. ALTARS. RITUAL. PURIFICATION,"that, a man once burned and buried, his ghost is confined, powerless,"
4978,TEMPLES. ALTARS. RITUAL. PURIFICATION,to Hades. Hence his Achaeans neither worship the dead nor practise
4979,TEMPLES. ALTARS. RITUAL. PURIFICATION,"purification to avoid avenging ghosts. These rites are Ionic, Attic,"
4980,TEMPLES. ALTARS. RITUAL. PURIFICATION,"and, in historic Greece, are Hellenic, also Asiatic. They make an"

5151,HOMER AND IONIA,While the ancients believed that the Homeric poems were composed in the

5153,HOMER AND IONIA,"modern critics often hold that the earliest lays were made in Greece,"
5154,HOMER AND IONIA,but that our _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ contain a large percentage of much

5161,HOMER AND IONIA,"dead Protesilaus. They are brigaded with Locrian light-armed archers,"
5162,HOMER AND IONIA,"the Boeotians, Phthians, and Epeians of Elis, and ""the picked men of"
5163,HOMER AND IONIA,"the Athenians,"" whose leaders are Menestheus, king of Athens, as in the"
5164,HOMER AND IONIA,"Catalogue, and three others. Thus the Ionians appear to be equivalent"
5165,HOMER AND IONIA,"to the Athenians. The epithet ""chiton-trailers"" occurs but this once"
5166,HOMER AND IONIA,"in Homer, and, of course, is inappropriate to the warlike occasion:"
5167,HOMER AND IONIA,the Ionians of the seventh century certainly wore the short tight
5168,HOMER AND IONIA,"_cypassis_, not the chiton, when actively engaged. In the Ionian hymn"
5169,HOMER AND IONIA,"to Apollo the Ionians are ""chiton-trailers,"" but the occasion is a"
5170,HOMER AND IONIA,public festival.
5171,HOMER AND IONIA,
5172,HOMER AND IONIA,"The whole passage, according to Mr. Leaf, is ""very probably an Attic"
5173,HOMER AND IONIA,"interpolation, with the object of giving respectable antiquity to the"
5174,HOMER AND IONIA,"hegemony of Athens over the Ionian tribes""; but, as the Ionians of"
5175,HOMER AND IONIA,"Asia were proud of their connection with Athens, and far from proud,"
5176,HOMER AND IONIA,"says Herodotus, of the name Ionian, _they_ are as likely as the"
5177,HOMER AND IONIA,"Athenians to have added the lines. In short, the Ionian name, like the"
5178,HOMER AND IONIA,"Dorian and the Aeolian names, never occurs in the _Iliad_; while the"
5179,HOMER AND IONIA,"Athenian king, Menestheus, never draws sword or throws spear in the"
5180,HOMER AND IONIA,"poem. It will be observed that, when he does mention Athenian leaders,"
5181,HOMER AND IONIA,"Menestheus the king, Bias, Stichios, and Pheidas, Homer does not, as is"
5182,HOMER AND IONIA,"his custom, assign to any one of them a divine ancestor, nor even name"
5183,HOMER AND IONIA,"the father of any one of them, except Petoos, father of Menestheus. He"
5184,HOMER AND IONIA,tells no anecdote about any of them. In the Catalogue (ii. 546-551) the
5185,HOMER AND IONIA,"Athenians alone appear as worshippers of dead men, though in Mycenaean"
5186,HOMER AND IONIA,"pre-Homeric Greece this rite was certainly part of religion, as also"
5187,HOMER AND IONIA,"in historic Greece, and in Attica it has an uninterrupted record. It"
5188,HOMER AND IONIA,"is not inconceivable, though by no means certain, that the Athenians"
5189,HOMER AND IONIA,"interpolated their own mention in the Catalogue, with the very few"
5190,HOMER AND IONIA,"allusions to their king, Menestheus; but except for these, the epics"
5191,HOMER AND IONIA,"almost ignore Attica, ignore the Ionians, and, to learn anything of"
5192,HOMER AND IONIA,"their early history, we must turn to other sources."
5193,HOMER AND IONIA,
5194,HOMER AND IONIA,"By the time of Pausanias (post-Christian) and much earlier, for"
5195,HOMER AND IONIA,"Euripides wrote a play against the myth, and it was current in the time"
5196,HOMER AND IONIA,"of Herodotus, the Athenians and Ionians had arranged for themselves a"
5197,HOMER AND IONIA,fabulous genealogy. Their purpose was to connect themselves with the
5198,HOMER AND IONIA,"supposed most genuine prehistoric Hellenes, namely, those of Achilles's"
5199,HOMER AND IONIA,"realm in Hellas, part of the kingdom of Peleus, in south-west Thessaly."
5200,HOMER AND IONIA,
5201,HOMER AND IONIA,In precisely the same way the Scottish makers of fabulous genealogy
5202,HOMER AND IONIA,"connected the Stewart kings,--really Fitz Alans, with the Dalriadic"
5203,HOMER AND IONIA,Royal House of the Scoti from Ireland (descendants of the Scythian
5204,HOMER AND IONIA,"princess, Scota), who invaded Argyll about 500 A.D. The name of these"
5205,HOMER AND IONIA,Scoti of Ireland had finally been given to the whole country north of
5206,HOMER AND IONIA,"Tweed and Esk, and so its kings must be _Eteoscoti_, genuine Scots."
5207,HOMER AND IONIA,
5208,HOMER AND IONIA,The Athenian and Ionian genealogists worked on the same principles.
5209,HOMER AND IONIA,"Their heroes are as apocryphal as Princess Scota of Scythia, and their"
5210,HOMER AND IONIA,genealogies vary with the motives of each genealogist. They believed
5211,HOMER AND IONIA,"that they were ""Pelasgians,"" that they did not originally bear the name"
5212,HOMER AND IONIA,"which was by their time prepotent, ""Hellenes,"" and was applied to all"
5213,HOMER AND IONIA,"Greeks; but, in the fable given by Pausanias they hitched themselves"
5214,HOMER AND IONIA,thus on to the Hellenes and Achaioi whom Achilles led from Thessaly.
5215,HOMER AND IONIA,"To the seacoast on the south of the Corinthian gulf, the _Aigialos_ or"
5216,HOMER AND IONIA,"""sea-board"" (held by Agamemnon in the Catalogue) came Xuthus, son of"
5217,HOMER AND IONIA,"Hellen, out of Thessaly; being expelled, after Hellen's death, by his"
5218,HOMER AND IONIA,"brothers. He had first fled to Athens, which in all these fabrications"
5219,HOMER AND IONIA,"represents herself as not originally Hellenic or Achaean, but as"
5220,HOMER AND IONIA,"the constant asylum of all distressed Achaean princes; Theban, like"
5221,HOMER AND IONIA,"Oedipous, or Eleian, like the descendants of Nestor, and Orestes,"
5222,HOMER AND IONIA,"having here Homeric warrant (_Odyssey,_ iii. 306). We have a parallel"
5223,HOMER AND IONIA,"in the continuous efforts of Highland genealogists, at one period, to"
5224,HOMER AND IONIA,claim descent from Normans who came north out of England and married
5225,HOMER AND IONIA,the heiresses of the Celtic chiefs; as the Campbells (Crooked-Mouths)
5226,HOMER AND IONIA,"claimed descent from a Norman ""De Campo Bello,"" or Beauchamp."
5227,HOMER AND IONIA,
5228,HOMER AND IONIA,"On these lines, then, the Hellene from Thessaly, Xuthus, married at"
5229,HOMER AND IONIA,"Athens the heiress of the king, the daughter of Erechtheus; and had"
5230,HOMER AND IONIA,"two sons, Achaeus and Ion. Thus the Achaeans of south-west Thessaly"
5231,HOMER AND IONIA,"have a little of Athenian blood, for Achaeus went back to Thessaly and"
5232,HOMER AND IONIA,reigned there; and the Ionians of Athens are mixed up with the sons of
5233,HOMER AND IONIA,"Hellen in a more roundabout way. Ion, son of Xuthus, son of Hellen, was"
5234,HOMER AND IONIA,"domiciled in the _Aigialos_, the south coast of the Corinthian gulf,"
5235,HOMER AND IONIA,"because his father, Xuthus, had been driven thither from Athens, and"
5236,HOMER AND IONIA,"reigned there. Ion succeeded to the throne of the _Aigialos_, but was"
5237,HOMER AND IONIA,"buried in Attica, having died there while in command of an Athenian"
5238,HOMER AND IONIA,army. His seacoast subjects on the southern seaboard of the Corinthian
5239,HOMER AND IONIA,"gulf, originally ""Pelasgians,"" but now called after him ""Ionians,"""
5240,HOMER AND IONIA,"were thus in relations with Attica, and they migrated thither in a"
5241,HOMER AND IONIA,"body, when they were driven from home by the Achaeans whom the Dorian"
5242,HOMER AND IONIA,invaders had expelled from their seats in the southern and western
5243,HOMER AND IONIA,"Peloponnese. The Ionians, so far, appear as a pre-Achaean people of"
5244,HOMER AND IONIA,"the northern coast of Peloponnesus, Hellenic only through their Royal"
5245,HOMER AND IONIA,"House, that of Ion; and later settled in Attica, among a people also"
5246,HOMER AND IONIA,pre-Hellenic in origin.
5247,HOMER AND IONIA,
5248,HOMER AND IONIA,"Attica later offered an asylum to the Neleidae, descendants of Nestor,"
5249,HOMER AND IONIA,"who, like the Fitz Alan Stewarts in Scotland, obtained the throne of"
5250,HOMER AND IONIA,"the country in which they settled. When a son of Codrus, the last of"
5251,HOMER AND IONIA,"these Neleid kings of Athens, led a colony from Attica to the Asian"
5252,HOMER AND IONIA,"coast, the most part of the Attic emigrants were Ionians settled in"
5253,HOMER AND IONIA,"Attica, not Athenians, though some Athenians accompanied them; and the"
5254,HOMER AND IONIA,"Royal contingent, starting from Athens, settled at Miletus.[1]"
5255,HOMER AND IONIA,
5256,HOMER AND IONIA,"Thus, in this legend, the people of Attica, in the main, are not"
5257,HOMER AND IONIA,"Hellenic, not Achaean in origin, but are connected with the Thessalian"
5258,HOMER AND IONIA,"Hellenes and Achaioi by Royal marriages; while, though not in origin"
5259,HOMER AND IONIA,"Ionians, they are intermingled, both in Attica and in the Asian"
5260,HOMER AND IONIA,"settlements, with that seacoast people, themselves only Achaean through"
5261,HOMER AND IONIA,"the grandson of Hellen, Ion, their king."
5262,HOMER AND IONIA,
5263,HOMER AND IONIA,"Historic Greek inquirers understood the matter in that way, and we must"
5264,HOMER AND IONIA,"first examine their ""Pelasgian"" theories."
5265,HOMER AND IONIA,
5266,HOMER AND IONIA,"With theories ancient or modern, fantastic or scientific, or both"
5267,HOMER AND IONIA,"scientific and fantastic, about ""Pelasgians"" and other ""races"" in"
5268,HOMER AND IONIA,the prehistoric south of Europe; with deductions from place-names
5269,HOMER AND IONIA,"in Greece, the isles, and the Asian coasts; with speculations about"
5270,HOMER AND IONIA,"""Aryans"" and ""non-Aryans,"" long-headed and short-headed, dark-haired"
5271,HOMER AND IONIA,"and light-haired peoples, I have nothing to do. We have not statistics"
5272,HOMER AND IONIA,"of pigmentation in prehistoric or in historic Greece, or craniological"
5273,HOMER AND IONIA,statistics. We cannot translate certain fourth century inscriptions
5274,HOMER AND IONIA,"from Crete, written in Greek characters, bat in a language which,"
5275,HOMER AND IONIA,"though not improbably ""Indo-European,"" must have been to Greeks as"
5276,HOMER AND IONIA,unintelligible as to ourselves. We cannot even read the characters of
5277,HOMER AND IONIA,Minoan writing. The much manipulated legends of movements of peoples
5278,HOMER AND IONIA,"which reach us in Greek books vary enormously, as Pausanias says, from"
5279,HOMER AND IONIA,"each other, and are no more historical than the Irish legends of the"
5280,HOMER AND IONIA,"migrations of the Scots from Scythia to Scotland by way of Athens,"
5281,HOMER AND IONIA,"Egypt, and Spain. My sole object is to make intelligible the version"
5282,HOMER AND IONIA,"of their own origin which the Athenians and Ionians offered, and to"
5283,HOMER AND IONIA,"show that they did, in some moods, draw a distinction between their own"
5284,HOMER AND IONIA,"ancestors and Homer's Hellenes and Achaeans. There _was_ a distinction,"
5285,HOMER AND IONIA,"in tradition, religion, rites, and customs, but there may have been no"
5286,HOMER AND IONIA,great difference in blood and language.
5287,HOMER AND IONIA,
5288,HOMER AND IONIA,"One thing, then, is certain, the Athenians and Ionians admitted that"
5289,HOMER AND IONIA,they were Hellenic in race and speech merely through slight contact
5290,HOMER AND IONIA,"with Achaeans. Attica was never ""Achaeanised"" in religion, burial"
5291,HOMER AND IONIA,"rites, and other ritual. Attica was never conquered by Achaeans, she"
5292,HOMER AND IONIA,"stood apart. Now this claim to be a region apart, conquered neither"
5293,HOMER AND IONIA,"by Achaeans nor Dorians, is certainly supported by the fact that the"
5294,HOMER AND IONIA,traditions and legends of Attica stand widely remote in all respects
5295,HOMER AND IONIA,"from the ancient Achaean legends in Homer, and in Theban and Minyan and"
5296,HOMER AND IONIA,"Aetolian ""saga,"" or bardic traditions.[2] The traditions of the Ionians"
5297,HOMER AND IONIA,"in Asia, again, are connected with those of Attica rather than with the"
5298,HOMER AND IONIA,"Achaean saga, although the Ionians of Asia were not, and were known not"
5299,HOMER AND IONIA,"to be, by any means of solely Attic descent. This is confessed."
5300,HOMER AND IONIA,
5301,HOMER AND IONIA,"Returning to the Ionians of Asia, and their account of themselves given"
5302,HOMER AND IONIA,"in the time of Herodotus, we find that it agrees with the fabulous"
5303,HOMER AND IONIA,genealogies already studied. The Ionians claimed to have in-habited
5304,HOMER AND IONIA,"twelve cities of what, in the time of Herodotus, was called ""Achaia,"""
5305,HOMER AND IONIA,the _Aigialos_ in the northern Peloponnese;--that they were driven
5306,HOMER AND IONIA,"thence to Attica by Achaeans, fugitives from the Dorians in other parts"
5307,HOMER AND IONIA,"of Peloponnese, is asserted by Herodotus. Ionians were also, of old,"
5308,HOMER AND IONIA,"_in Boeotia_, neighbours of the ""Cadmeians,"" and some of the Cadmeians"
5309,HOMER AND IONIA,"were admitted, on conditions, to Athenian citizenship.[3]"
5310,HOMER AND IONIA,
5311,HOMER AND IONIA,"It thus appears that the people later called, in Asia, ""Ionians,"" had"
5312,HOMER AND IONIA,"been dwellers on the coasts of Boeotia and Attica, as well as on the"
5313,HOMER AND IONIA,"northern Peloponnese. That they were then and there known as ""Ionians"""
5314,HOMER AND IONIA,it would be difficult to prove. Homer has nothing to say of the Ionians
5315,HOMER AND IONIA,as a peculiar people in the Peloponnesus or Boeotia. Of their twelve
5316,HOMER AND IONIA,"Peloponnesian cities, the Catalogue gives Orneai, Pellênê, Aigeira, and"
5317,HOMER AND IONIA,Helikê to Agamemnon.[4]
5318,HOMER AND IONIA,
5319,HOMER AND IONIA,"If Homer really knew any people called Ionians at all, they were"
5320,HOMER AND IONIA,"Athenian. Meanwhile the people of the Ionian name in Asia were,"
5321,HOMER AND IONIA,"according to Herodotus, ""a mixed multitude,"" including members of the"
5322,HOMER AND IONIA,"communities known to Homer as Abantes of Euboea, with forty ships,"
5323,HOMER AND IONIA,"Phocians, even Arcadians, Cretans, and many others. All these could"
5324,HOMER AND IONIA,"only be lumped together as ""Ionians"" after their settlement in Asia,"
5325,HOMER AND IONIA,and their alliance with the Ionian colonists from Attica.
5326,HOMER AND IONIA,
5327,HOMER AND IONIA,"If the so-called Ionian emigrants were thus mixed, and if some of"
5328,HOMER AND IONIA,"them possessed Achaean lays or legends, and at first practised only"
5329,HOMER AND IONIA,"the rites mentioned by Homer, such as cremation and cairn-burial, it"
5330,HOMER AND IONIA,would appear that the pre-Hellenic element among these settlers in
5331,HOMER AND IONIA,"Asia overpowered the other elements, or that the Cyclic poets of Ionia"
5332,HOMER AND IONIA,"were mainly of pre-Hellenic origin. Their poems, at all events, are"
5333,HOMER AND IONIA,"in harmony with Attic ideas and usages, not with Homer's statements:"
5334,HOMER AND IONIA,"and, as we shall show, the Ionian poets cannot have tampered much with"
5335,HOMER AND IONIA,"our Homer, for the two Epics never admit the Ionian manners which"
5336,HOMER AND IONIA,"are copiously illustrated by the Ionian poets of the Trojan war, the"
5337,HOMER AND IONIA,Cyclics.
5338,HOMER AND IONIA,
5339,HOMER AND IONIA,"According to Thucydides as well as Herodotus, the so-called Ionian"
5340,HOMER AND IONIA,migration was a movement of mixed peoples. The leading men of various
5341,HOMER AND IONIA,Achaean regions had found an asylum in Attica during the troubles
5342,HOMER AND IONIA,"caused by the Dorian incursions, and ""so greatly increased the number"
5343,HOMER AND IONIA,"of inhabitants that Attica became incapable of containing them, and was"
5344,HOMER AND IONIA,"at last obliged to send colonies to Ionia.""[5]"
5345,HOMER AND IONIA,
5346,HOMER AND IONIA,We are thus on almost historic ground when we believe that the settlers
5347,HOMER AND IONIA,"in Ionia, though their tendency was to claim Athenian connections, were"
5348,HOMER AND IONIA,"""a mixed multitude"" from many States, mainly of the seacoasts; and it"
5349,HOMER AND IONIA,"is natural to suppose that they intermarried with Carians at Miletus,"
5350,HOMER AND IONIA,"as Herodotus says that they also did with Lycians, and other Asiatic"
5351,HOMER AND IONIA,civilised peoples. Though alien religions might be accepted by the
5352,HOMER AND IONIA,"settlers, these beliefs would be Hellenised, as usual; and the Olympian"
5353,HOMER AND IONIA,"Poseidon, the Homeric sea-god, patronised the Ionian league of cities."
5354,HOMER AND IONIA,
5355,HOMER AND IONIA,We really have no historical evidence for the earliest conditions of
5356,HOMER AND IONIA,Ionian life in Asia. Mr. Murray supposes the early settlers to have
5357,HOMER AND IONIA,"lost all ""tribal obligations,"" all ""old laws,"" and even ""household"
5358,HOMER AND IONIA,"and family life."" ""It looks as if the ancestors of the Ionians had in"
5359,HOMER AND IONIA,the extreme stress of their migrations lost hold upon their Achaean
5360,HOMER AND IONIA,"traditions."" But the Ionians had no _Achaean_ traditions to lose! They"
5361,HOMER AND IONIA,"built walls to their new cities, and inside the wall a man ""could take"
5362,HOMER AND IONIA,"breath. He could become for a time a man again, instead of a frightened"
5363,HOMER AND IONIA,"beast."" A terrible picture is drawn of the sufferings and ferocious"
5364,HOMER AND IONIA,"cruelties of the invaders, who, however, remain orthodox in religion"
5365,HOMER AND IONIA,"after all, and confident in ""the manifest help of Zeus and Apollo.""[6]"
5366,HOMER AND IONIA,"This is not the condition of frightened beasts. In fact, they were not"
5367,HOMER AND IONIA,in that terror-stricken condition when they were able to build walls.
5368,HOMER AND IONIA,
5369,HOMER AND IONIA,"No doubt there was a great deal of rough work; though, as shall be"
5370,HOMER AND IONIA,"shown, judging from the art of the Dipylon, the Attic colonists were"
5371,HOMER AND IONIA,"highly civilised men, with large ships, and everything handsome about"
5372,HOMER AND IONIA,"them, who could make well-organised short voyages, with abundance of"
5373,HOMER AND IONIA,"stores. Nor, when they landed, were they, like the early Puritans of"
5374,HOMER AND IONIA,"New England, in a country of naked savages. Lycians and Carians, in"
5375,HOMER AND IONIA,"Homer, are as much civilised as the Achaeans: a Carian woman was not a"
5376,HOMER AND IONIA,bloodthirsty squaw.
5377,HOMER AND IONIA,
5378,HOMER AND IONIA,"It is not to late legends, but to archaeology, that we must look for"
5379,HOMER AND IONIA,"information: ""on archaeology fell, and falls, the burden of proof in"
5380,HOMER AND IONIA,"this inquiry.""[7]"
5381,HOMER AND IONIA,
5382,HOMER AND IONIA,"First, as to the culture of the mainland which the colonists left;"
5383,HOMER AND IONIA,we do know through excavations at Sparta something about _Dorian_
5384,HOMER AND IONIA,"civilisation there as early as the ninth century B.C., and it is"
5385,HOMER AND IONIA,probable that the Ionians in Europe were rather in advance of than
5386,HOMER AND IONIA,behind the contemporary Dorians in the arts of life. The precinct of
5387,HOMER AND IONIA,"Artemis Orthia at Sparta has been excavated, and yields ""remains of a"
5388,HOMER AND IONIA,temple in crude brick with wooden frame-work ... this structure the
5389,HOMER AND IONIA,"discoverers"" (members of the British School of Athens) ""refer to the"
5390,HOMER AND IONIA,"ninth century B.C."" A similar temple ""has appeared also in Hellenic"
5391,HOMER AND IONIA,"Asia, at Neandria in the Aeolic Troad."""
5392,HOMER AND IONIA,
5393,HOMER AND IONIA,"Near the Orthian temple was ""a great Altar of Sacrifice, whose"
5394,HOMER AND IONIA,"orientation was the same.""[8]"
5395,HOMER AND IONIA,
5396,HOMER AND IONIA,"Homer's men, we saw, usually sacrifice hecatombs outside of the temple,"
5397,HOMER AND IONIA,though twelve kine are sacrificed _in_ the temple of the Trojan Athena.
5398,HOMER AND IONIA,
5399,HOMER AND IONIA,The votive objects found in this Spartan precinct of the ninth century
5400,HOMER AND IONIA,"were pottery in the Geometric, post-Aegean style, with ivory plaques,"
5401,HOMER AND IONIA,"at least as large as an ordinary playing card, covering the safety pin"
5402,HOMER AND IONIA,of the _fibula_. The earliest designs incised on these plaques of ivory
5403,HOMER AND IONIA,"""repeat in more than one case Aegean motives"" (such as the goddess"
5404,HOMER AND IONIA,holding a bird in each hand); the style is touched with Mesopotamian
5405,HOMER AND IONIA,"influences, but more deeply by the art of the Bronze Age in the area"
5406,HOMER AND IONIA,"of the Danube. The ""double coil"" or ""pair of spectacles"" shape of"
5407,HOMER AND IONIA,"fibula-cover, familiar in the Danubian region, also occurs.[9]"
5408,HOMER AND IONIA,
5409,HOMER AND IONIA,"Such being the art in the new home of the Dorian invaders, we expect"
5410,HOMER AND IONIA,to find art rather better than worse among the Ionians at Attica at
5411,HOMER AND IONIA,"the same period--the ninth century B.C., which is doubtless much later"
5412,HOMER AND IONIA,than the central period of the Ionian migration to Asia. The tombs of
5413,HOMER AND IONIA,"Spata in Attica, and the treasure from Aegina in the British Museum,"
5414,HOMER AND IONIA,"are taken as relics of the late ""Sub-Aegean"" art of, say, the tenth"
5415,HOMER AND IONIA,"to ninth centuries. The ivories of Sparta ""suggest some art of West"
5416,HOMER AND IONIA,"Asia"": the Aegina objects in gold are partly ""Aegean"" survivals, partly"
5417,HOMER AND IONIA,show unmistakable Egyptian influence passed through an Oriental medium.
5418,HOMER AND IONIA,"The well-known gold cup of Aegina, with its rosette and four spirals,"
5419,HOMER AND IONIA,has a parallel from one of the rich royal tombs of the Mycenaean
5420,HOMER AND IONIA,"acropolis: there are also, as at Mycenae, many thin round plaques of"
5421,HOMER AND IONIA,"gold, probably sewn originally on robes. The rings bear no signets: one"
5422,HOMER AND IONIA,"is in the form of a buckler, like a reduced Mycenaean figure-of-eight"
5423,HOMER AND IONIA,"shield, inlaid with blue glass paste. The figure of a man or god"
5424,HOMER AND IONIA,"holding a water-fowl in each hand, and wearing a loin-cloth, is of a"
5425,HOMER AND IONIA,modified Egyptian character. The date of the objects is placed between
5426,HOMER AND IONIA,the tenth and ninth centuries.[10]
5427,HOMER AND IONIA,
5428,HOMER AND IONIA,Probably the Ionian emigrants from the mainland near Aegina left behind
5429,HOMER AND IONIA,"them some, and probably they took with them other craftsmen capable of"
5430,HOMER AND IONIA,executing such work in gold as we have described. But they also left
5431,HOMER AND IONIA,"in Attica the potters who, about the ninth to eighth centuries, B.C.,"
5432,HOMER AND IONIA,"covered the great vases, which did duty for headstones in the cemetery"
5433,HOMER AND IONIA,"of the Dipylon, with geometric ornament and barbaric representations of"
5434,HOMER AND IONIA,"life. It was no barbarian life that they knew, crudely as they designed"
5435,HOMER AND IONIA,"it. The people of Athens, as the vases prove, had four-horse chariots;"
5436,HOMER AND IONIA,"had large ships manned by many oarsmen, and furnished with a submerged"
5437,HOMER AND IONIA,sharp ram. The warriors in the chariots wore shields slung by baldrics:
5438,HOMER AND IONIA,"in form they were circular, in other cases they exaggerated, in much"
5439,HOMER AND IONIA,"smaller dimensions, the features of the Aegean figure-of-eight shield,"
5440,HOMER AND IONIA,or were smaller forms of the Aegean oblong shield. Here and there a
5441,HOMER AND IONIA,spearman holds in front of him an oval shield _by the handle_. The
5442,HOMER AND IONIA,"swords are straight short swords, worn at right angles to the waist,"
5443,HOMER AND IONIA,"not heavy Homeric swords, slung by a baldric from the shoulder. In"
5444,HOMER AND IONIA,"some cases, however, heavy leaf-shaped blades are used, both for cut"
5445,HOMER AND IONIA,and thrust.
5446,HOMER AND IONIA,
5447,HOMER AND IONIA,The people had great spectacular funerals. The body of the dead lay
5448,HOMER AND IONIA,"on a bier in the house, while men, women, and children, mere skeleton"
5449,HOMER AND IONIA,"figures, plucked out their hair with both hands. Then the body was"
5450,HOMER AND IONIA,"borne in a chariot to the grave (it was seldom cremated), and a"
5451,HOMER AND IONIA,procession of charioteers followed.
5452,HOMER AND IONIA,
5453,HOMER AND IONIA,"The swords and spears were of iron, none had richly adorned hilts of"
5454,HOMER AND IONIA,ivory and gold.
5455,HOMER AND IONIA,
5456,HOMER AND IONIA,"The gold work of the period, chiefly stamped on thin bands, was not"
5457,HOMER AND IONIA,quite so crude as that of the potter with his triangle reversed for a
5458,HOMER AND IONIA,"body, the monstrous thighs and calves of his men, their bird-shaped"
5459,HOMER AND IONIA,"inhuman faces,--all of them remote from the Aegean art, and apparently"
5460,HOMER AND IONIA,of northern origin. The artists in gold work were in advance of the
5461,HOMER AND IONIA,"vase-painters, whose horses usually have a thing like a fish for head,"
5462,HOMER AND IONIA,set on a neck like a serpent.
5463,HOMER AND IONIA,
5464,HOMER AND IONIA,"The Attic region, towards the end of the Ionian migration, thus"
5465,HOMER AND IONIA,"presents the decay of Aegean and the bloom of geometric decoration, and"
5466,HOMER AND IONIA,"of barbaric, probably northern design. None the less the life depicted"
5467,HOMER AND IONIA,"so barbarously was no barbaric life. Bad as is the art, you see that"
5468,HOMER AND IONIA,the life is Hellenic.
5469,HOMER AND IONIA,
5470,HOMER AND IONIA,At the same time the Dipylon life is wholly un-Homeric. The manner of
5471,HOMER AND IONIA,"burial, the huge vases in place of the cairn and pillar, the metal of"
5472,HOMER AND IONIA,"the weapons, iron, their want of adornment, the size, shape, and mode"
5473,HOMER AND IONIA,"of carrying the sword, the tearing out of their own hair by mourners,"
5474,HOMER AND IONIA,"the size of the shields, and even the dress of the women who, in my"
5475,HOMER AND IONIA,"opinion, wear skirts, not chitons, are all of a nature unknown to the"
5476,HOMER AND IONIA,Epics. Poets of the Dipylon age could never have preserved the uniform
5477,HOMER AND IONIA,Homeric descriptions of details totally unlike what they saw in actual
5478,HOMER AND IONIA,existence.
5479,HOMER AND IONIA,
5480,HOMER AND IONIA,"About the relics of the earliest Ionian settlements in Asia,"
5481,HOMER AND IONIA,archaeology now knows something. The excavations of Mr. Hogarth on the
5482,HOMER AND IONIA,"earliest site of the Ionian temple of Artemis at Ephesus (700 B.C.?),"
5483,HOMER AND IONIA,"revealed thousands of votive offerings in gold, ivory, bone, paste,"
5484,HOMER AND IONIA,"crystal, and other materials. These had been ""carefully laid between"
5485,HOMER AND IONIA,"the slabs for some hieratic purpose,"" probably under the central statue"
5486,HOMER AND IONIA,"of the goddess. Mr. Hogarth dates the deposit at about 700 B.C., ""some"
5487,HOMER AND IONIA,"two centuries after the traditional landing of the colonists."""
5488,HOMER AND IONIA,
5489,HOMER AND IONIA,That date tells us little about the condition of the settlers at the
5490,HOMER AND IONIA,time of landing (we can only guess as to whether they had almost ceased
5491,HOMER AND IONIA,"to be human at that moment), but many objects may be heirlooms of"
5492,HOMER AND IONIA,"earlier date; ""in any case the elaborate execution and design of the"
5493,HOMER AND IONIA,"Ionian documents, notably the trinkets and jewels in electrum, imply a"
5494,HOMER AND IONIA,"long previous evolution of skilled craft""; and there are indications"
5495,HOMER AND IONIA,"""that this Primitive treasure was, in the main, made at Ephesus"
5496,HOMER AND IONIA,"itself."" This is proved by the presence of goldsmiths' refuse in the"
5497,HOMER AND IONIA,temple. The treasure has many analogies with that of Enkomi (Cyprus)
5498,HOMER AND IONIA,"in the British Museum, which is of the period of the re-occupation of"
5499,HOMER AND IONIA,"the palace of Cnossos in Crete (dated about 1400), and is therefore of"
5500,HOMER AND IONIA,the close of the age of bronze. The Ephesian treasure has also many
5501,HOMER AND IONIA,points of close analogy with the later Aegean remains at Mycenae and
5502,HOMER AND IONIA,Sparta in Attica. There are the gold jewels meant to be sewn on to the
5503,HOMER AND IONIA,robes; there are the clear crystals so common in the ancient graves of
5504,HOMER AND IONIA,the Mycenaean acropolis; the familiar double axe of Crete is still a
5505,HOMER AND IONIA,"decorative motive; we find, as on the Lion Gate of Mycenae, two animals"
5506,HOMER AND IONIA,"opposed in heraldic fashion, and fibulae decorated with Baltic amber,"
5507,HOMER AND IONIA,"also the ""spectacles"" fibula-cover in ivory, common as far north as"
5508,HOMER AND IONIA,Bosnia.
5509,HOMER AND IONIA,
5510,HOMER AND IONIA,The general result of the archaeological evidence for early Ionia is
5511,HOMER AND IONIA,"to show, in early Ionian work, the Aegean element stronger, and the"
5512,HOMER AND IONIA,"Danubian or central European element less strong, than in contemporary"
5513,HOMER AND IONIA,Attica of the Dipylon period. In Attica of 1000-800 B.C. there was
5514,HOMER AND IONIA,the mixture of new northern and of old Aegean blood and civilisation;
5515,HOMER AND IONIA,"but, says Mr. Hogarth, ""the Aegean element was, I conceive, relatively"
5516,HOMER AND IONIA,"very much more numerous and potent in the Ionian land,""--in"
5517,HOMER AND IONIA,"Asia,--""although, to a very large extent, not indigenous there."" The"
5518,HOMER AND IONIA,"Ionians, as far as archaeology shows, were more Aegean than the people"
5519,HOMER AND IONIA,whom they left behind in Attica.
5520,HOMER AND IONIA,
5521,HOMER AND IONIA,"Thus the evidence, so far, is in favour of the mass of Ionian emigrants"
5522,HOMER AND IONIA,"having been of the older people,--whether we call it ""Pelasgian of the"
5523,HOMER AND IONIA,"coast lands,"" or by any other name,--and of the older prae-Dipylon"
5524,HOMER AND IONIA,"school of art. ""The first departure,"" says Mr. Hogarth, ""may have been"
5525,HOMER AND IONIA,"due to the Achaean influx into Greece,"" though the later Dorian influx"
5526,HOMER AND IONIA,"may have presented a more powerful motive; for, by the Greek story, the"
5527,HOMER AND IONIA,Achaeans driven from Argos and Laconia thrust the Ionians out of the
5528,HOMER AND IONIA,Peloponnesus. The archaeological evidence does not go back far enough
5529,HOMER AND IONIA,to enable us to estimate exactly the state of the Ionians when they
5530,HOMER AND IONIA,"first landed in Asia. We only know that, some two centuries later,"
5531,HOMER AND IONIA,"their art was much more in the Aegean than in the Dipylon manner, and"
5532,HOMER AND IONIA,had been so for long. They must have rapidly recovered from their
5533,HOMER AND IONIA,"perfect oblivion of their ancient laws, rites, beliefs, and traditions."
5534,HOMER AND IONIA,
5535,HOMER AND IONIA,"Mr. Hogarth concludes: ""Note that the date thus assigned"" (for the"
5536,HOMER AND IONIA,"Greek migration, a prolonged movement) ""fits with the indications"
5537,HOMER AND IONIA,"in Homer. The Epics, it has often been remarked, show not only no"
5538,HOMER AND IONIA,"knowledge of a Hellenic Asia, but also none of a Dorian conquest of"
5539,HOMER AND IONIA,Peloponnesus. They were probably anterior in original composition to
5540,HOMER AND IONIA,"the establishment of both these states of things,"" of Greeks in Asia,"
5541,HOMER AND IONIA,Dorians in Peloponnesus.[11]
5542,HOMER AND IONIA,
5543,HOMER AND IONIA,"Now archaeology dates the Ephesian finds, which, in the main, are"
5544,HOMER AND IONIA,"still ""Aegean"" in character, during the very age when, according to"
5545,HOMER AND IONIA,"general opinion, the Ionian Cyclic Epics were composed. The early"
5546,HOMER AND IONIA,"Cyclic poems are usually dated about 770-730 B.C., when the Ephesian"
5547,HOMER AND IONIA,"treasure was being made.[12] Ionian art at Ephesus, and at that date,"
5548,HOMER AND IONIA,was much more Aegean than the contemporary art in Attica. There is thus
5549,HOMER AND IONIA,"a fair presumption that the Aegean element, Hellenised, was a strong"
5550,HOMER AND IONIA,element in the Ionian population; and we are to demonstrate that the
5551,HOMER AND IONIA,"Ionian Epics, though dealing with Achaean themes, abound in non-Achaean"
5552,HOMER AND IONIA,traits of life and religion; in the traits which Mr. Murray assigns to
5553,HOMER AND IONIA,"""the conquered races,""[13] apparently meaning the pre-Achaean Aegean"
5554,HOMER AND IONIA,"inhabitants of Greece. These traits are undeniably non-Homeric, and the"
5555,HOMER AND IONIA,"question must be faced, if the Ionian poets of the eighth and seventh"
5556,HOMER AND IONIA,"centuries are profuse in such matter, in the Cyclics; and if they"
5557,HOMER AND IONIA,also added a great mass to the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ at the same
5558,HOMER AND IONIA,"period, why did they keep their favourite themes out of the _Iliad_"
5559,HOMER AND IONIA,"and _Odyssey_? This question we study in ""The Ionian Cyclic Poems"";"
5560,HOMER AND IONIA,"but first we must prove that, whether the people of Attica and the"
5561,HOMER AND IONIA,"Ionians were apart in ""race"" from the Hellenes and Achaioi or not,"
5562,HOMER AND IONIA,they certainly stood originally apart from and out of the cycle of
5563,HOMER AND IONIA,Achaean traditions. The Ionians and Attic tragedians were reduced to
5564,HOMER AND IONIA,inventing new legends and new points of contact between themselves and
5565,HOMER AND IONIA,the Achaeans.

5580,NOTE,"there is no doubt that this population, if spoken of by Greeks as"
5581,NOTE,"""Pelasgian,"" was much more advanced in material culture than the"

5583,NOTE,and the isles.
5584,NOTE,
5585,NOTE,"On this point, then, that the Achaeans and Hellenes were more civilised"

5603,NOTE,

5607,NOTE,"""barbarous""; that they adopted the speech, Greek, of the Pelasgians"

5609,NOTE,"the lays of Pelasgian minstrels, who sang in Greek of the exploits"
5610,NOTE,"of Achaeans who were Celtic, but became merged in a Greek-speaking"
5611,NOTE,"Pelasgic population (_Early Age of Greece_, vol. i. p. 648). If so,"
5612,NOTE,the minstrels had entirely absorbed the non-Pelasgian customs and
5613,NOTE,"ideas, absence of ghosts, and hero-worship, of pollution, and ritual"
5614,NOTE,"purification, and human sacrifice, and the professed Olympian religion"
5615,NOTE,of their Achaean lords.
5616,NOTE,
5617,NOTE,"To the objection that, if Homer's poetic Pelasgian predecessors had the"
5618,NOTE,"good Greek, no Pelasgians known to Herodotus spoke it, Mr. Ridgeway"
5619,NOTE,"can reply that ""the Greeks considered Phrygians and Thracians to be"
5620,NOTE,"barbarous, though both spoke languages akin to Greek; so that, although"
5621,NOTE,"Herodotus thought the languages of Scylace and Placia"" (and of _all_"

5625,NOTE,

5634,NOTE,"See Herodotus, ii. 50, 51, for Pelasgians who, when the Athenians ""were"

5746,CHAPTER XV,
5747,CHAPTER XV,"Thus in the Platonic or pseudo-Platonic dialogue, _Minos_, Socrates"
5748,CHAPTER XV,points out that to no other hero does Homer give the same praise as to
5749,CHAPTER XV,"Minos, as not only a _son_, but a pupil of _Zeus_ (_Od_. xix. 178-180)."
5750,CHAPTER XV,"Says Socrates, ""Minos every ninth year conversed with Zeus, and went to"
5751,CHAPTER XV,"be instructed by his wisdom,""--""this is marvellous praise."" It is thus"
5752,CHAPTER XV,that Socrates understands the Homeric world. [Greek: Minoos enneooros
5753,CHAPTER XV,"Basileue Dios megalou oaristeis]: ""Minos was king, who every nine years"
5754,CHAPTER XV,"conversed with Zeus."" ""Every nine years Minos went to the cave of Zeus"
5755,CHAPTER XV,"to be instructed,"" adds Socrates; but of the cave of Zeus, Homer says"
5756,CHAPTER XV,nothing.
5757,CHAPTER XV,
5758,CHAPTER XV,The companion of Socrates then asks how Minos got such a bad name
5759,CHAPTER XV,"as ""an uneducated ruffian""? ""Because he made war on us of Athens,"""
5760,CHAPTER XV,"answered Socrates; ""and we are strong in poets, especially in that"
5761,CHAPTER XV,"delight of the populace, tragic poetry, which is very ancient with us;"
5762,CHAPTER XV,"and on the stage we avenged ourselves on Minos."""
5763,CHAPTER XV,
5764,CHAPTER XV,"In truth, while Homer presented Minos as a son and pupil of Zeus, as"
5765,CHAPTER XV,"no god himself, but a mortal man, whose sceptred spirit administered"
5766,CHAPTER XV,"justice to the souls in Hades, it was impossible for educated Athenians"
5767,CHAPTER XV,"not to recognise that their own wild tales (how wild few knew), were"
5768,CHAPTER XV,partisan fabrications.
5769,CHAPTER XV,
5770,CHAPTER XV,"Not only Homer, but Hesiod took the favourable view of Minos, as"
5771,CHAPTER XV,"against the hostile Attic legends; ""and these two are more worthy of"
5772,CHAPTER XV,"belief than all the tragic poets together,"" says Socrates (_Minos_, 318"
5773,CHAPTER XV,d).
5774,CHAPTER XV,
5775,CHAPTER XV,"The Athenians heaped not only Minos, but his wife and his brother"
5776,CHAPTER XV,"Rhadamanthus, under a pile of ordure. Helbig, who emphatically insists"
5777,CHAPTER XV,"on the gulf between Attic and Homeric accounts of Minos, may be"
5778,CHAPTER XV,consulted for the abominable anti-Minoan stories.[4]
5779,CHAPTER XV,
5780,CHAPTER XV,"In Homer, Cretan Idomeneus (_Iliad_, xiii. 450) gives his genealogy as--"

5789,CHAPTER XV,
5790,CHAPTER XV,"In the _Odyssey_, xi. 321-325, Minos is named as father of Ariadne,"
5791,CHAPTER XV,whose tale is alluded to in a puzzling way: the other heroines of
5792,CHAPTER XV,"the passage are Attic, Phaedra (wife of Theseus) and Procris. In xi."
5793,CHAPTER XV,"568571, Minos, ""splendid son of Zeus,"" is seen administering justice"
5794,CHAPTER XV,to the dead. In a false tale of Odysseus he calls himself a Cretan
5795,CHAPTER XV,"of the stock of Minos. In xix. 178, Minos is father of Deucalion,"
5796,CHAPTER XV,"and in some way is ""the nine years old,"" or is ""at periods of nine"
5797,CHAPTER XV,"years,"" the companion ([Greek: _oaristeis_]) of Zeus. There is in"
5798,CHAPTER XV,"Homer nothing about the Attic fables of bulls, the Minotaur, or Minoan"
5799,CHAPTER XV,cruelty. Homeric tradition accepts and glories in the just king Minos:
5800,CHAPTER XV,"Athenian tradition, in which Attica suffers grievous things at the"
5801,CHAPTER XV,"hands of Crete, heaps hatred and contumely on him, fixing on him the"
5802,CHAPTER XV,world-wide _Märchen_ of the evil being whose fair daughter befriends
5803,CHAPTER XV,the adventurous hero; and adding the _Märchen_ of the black-sailed
5804,CHAPTER XV,ship which should have borne white sails of good tidings to Aegeus.
5805,CHAPTER XV,
5806,CHAPTER XV,"It is not merely the Attic myths of Theseus of Crete, and of the"
5807,CHAPTER XV,"character of Minos, that differ from the Homeric. Attic legends are"
5808,CHAPTER XV,quite un-Homeric in character.[5] Two Attic characteristics may be
5809,CHAPTER XV,"noted. ""The story of the sacrifice of a maiden"" (or of several maidens"
5810,CHAPTER XV,"at once) ""appears and reappears in Attic tradition.... We have it"
5811,CHAPTER XV,"in Iphigeneia....""[6] But we have it not in Homer. Again, among the"
5812,CHAPTER XV,"royal family of Athens, in Attic tradition, it was chronic to be"
5813,CHAPTER XV,"metamorphosed into birds. The stories were meant, originally, to"
5814,CHAPTER XV,account for the colours and habits of birds; such tales are numberless
5815,CHAPTER XV,"in the legends of Australian and other savages, who have a whole"
5816,CHAPTER XV,"mythology of primal fowls, which is restated in the _parabasis_ of"
5817,CHAPTER XV,_The Birds_ of Aristophanes. Homer tells but one such bird myth. In
5818,CHAPTER XV,"_Odyssey_, xix. 518, Penelope speaks of the daughter of Pandareus,"
5819,CHAPTER XV,"the brown bright nightingale, lamenting ""Itylus, whom she slew with"
5820,CHAPTER XV,"the sword unwittingly; Itylus, son of Zethus the prince."" ""The story"
5821,CHAPTER XV,"has, _as would be expected in a Homeric myth, nothing whatever to do"
5822,CHAPTER XV,"with Athens_.""[7] The Attic story, much more horrible, is that of"
5823,CHAPTER XV,"Philomela, Procne, and Tereus: it is as bad as _Titus Andronicus_. The"
5824,CHAPTER XV,"Ionians transferred the scene to Miletus, Colophon, and Ephesus.[8]"
5825,CHAPTER XV,"Homer wholly abstains from Attic myths, except for the mention of their"
5826,CHAPTER XV,heroines in a dubious passage of the eleventh book of the _Odyssey_.
5827,CHAPTER XV,
5828,CHAPTER XV,"Thus the Ionians, though they have adopted Homeric traditions, have"
5829,CHAPTER XV,"counter-Homeric traditions, just as they have and retain the customs"
5830,CHAPTER XV,"and rites of ""the conquered race."" These are demonstrable facts. On"
5831,CHAPTER XV,"the other side, the Homeric poet ignores Ionian legends, and Ionians"
5832,CHAPTER XV,and Athenians have been unable to interweave Ionian tradition into the
5833,CHAPTER XV,_Iliad_ and _Odyssey_. There is no doubt about this matter; Homer has
5834,CHAPTER XV,"no Ionian, the Ionians had no Homeric traditions. This abstinence from"
5835,CHAPTER XV,"Attic legends is not peculiar to Homer. The greatest Achaean tradition,"
5836,CHAPTER XV,"after the Tale of Troy, was the Tale of Thebes. The Attic tragedians"
5837,CHAPTER XV,"have so Atticised it, especially in the _Oedipous Coloncus_ and the"
5838,CHAPTER XV,"_Suppliants_ of Euripides, that we think of the hapless Theban king as"
5839,CHAPTER XV,a patron saint of Athens; and of Theseus as his host and as the heroic
5840,CHAPTER XV,friend of Thebes.
5841,CHAPTER XV,
5842,CHAPTER XV,But the ancient epos of Thebes knew no more of Athens than did the
5843,CHAPTER XV,"ancient epos of Troy. The Athenians could not and did not pretend,"
5844,CHAPTER XV,"like the Argives, Arcadians, and other Peloponnesians, to have taken"
5845,CHAPTER XV,"part in the first great collective Achaean attack on Thebes, an"
5846,CHAPTER XV,"attack led by Adrastus, Tydeus, father of Diomede, Polynices, and the"
5847,CHAPTER XV,"rest.[9] Neither did they pretend, though Ionians dwelt near the Theban"
5848,CHAPTER XV,"Cadmeians in Boeotia, to have aided Thebes in her peril. Athens did"
5849,CHAPTER XV,allege that the useful Theseus led her army to rescue the unburied body
5850,CHAPTER XV,"of Polynices, or the bodies of him and Eteocles; it was her favourite"
5851,CHAPTER XV,boast.[10]
5852,CHAPTER XV,
5853,CHAPTER XV,"But this tale, as Grote says, ""seems to have had its origin in the"
5854,CHAPTER XV,"patriotic pride of the Athenians,"" in their ceaseless efforts to attach"
5855,CHAPTER XV,"themselves to the great traditions that steadily ignore them. Adrastus,"
5856,CHAPTER XV,"chief of the army which failed at Thebes, came, said the Athenians,"
5857,CHAPTER XV,"as a suppliant to the useful Theseus at Eleusis. Then Theseus, with"
5858,CHAPTER XV,"an Athenian force, vanquished the Thebans, and gave due burial to"
5859,CHAPTER XV,"the dead. Euripides and Isocrates boast of this Flower of Chivalry,"
5860,CHAPTER XV,Theseus;[11] and Pausanias saw the tombs of Eteocles and Polynices--at
5861,CHAPTER XV,Eleusis in Attica.[12] The Thebans denied the fable.
5862,CHAPTER XV,
5863,CHAPTER XV,"In the return match of the Epigonoi against Thebes, the Athenians did"
5864,CHAPTER XV,not pretend to have played a part. In the lists of heroes who take a
5865,CHAPTER XV,"share in the Argonautic expedition, and in the hunt of the Calydonian"
5866,CHAPTER XV,"boar, the name of Theseus appears; but he did no more than Menestheus"
5867,CHAPTER XV,achieved at Troy. The Ionians in Asia made a desperate effort to
5868,CHAPTER XV,connect themselves with the Trojan war by borrowing the descendants of
5869,CHAPTER XV,"Nestor, the Nelidae, who fled from the Dorians to Athens, obtained the"
5870,CHAPTER XV,"throne, and led the Ionian migration into Asia.[13] The very fact that"
5871,CHAPTER XV,"they had to borrow these refugees, in order to connect themselves with"
5872,CHAPTER XV,"Achaean ""saga,"" proves the Athenian lack of genuine mythical connection"
5873,CHAPTER XV,with the united efforts of the rest of Greece against Troy.
5874,CHAPTER XV,
5875,CHAPTER XV,"The burial of Oedipous at Colonus, the topic of the noble tragedy of"
5876,CHAPTER XV,"Sophocles, is, poetry apart, mere body-snatching. The _Iliad_ and"
5877,CHAPTER XV,"_Odyssey_,[14] and even Hesiod,[15] know nothing of a sepulchral"
5878,CHAPTER XV,connection of Oedipous with Athens. Oedipous's funeral feast was held
5879,CHAPTER XV,at Thebes. These sepulchral connections of Athens with the tale of
5880,CHAPTER XV,"Thebes are necessarily un-Homeric, for they are based on the very"
5881,CHAPTER XV,"fanaticism of hero-worship, and fall into line with the craze of"
5882,CHAPTER XV,"historic Greece for securing the relics of heroes, who will defend a"
5883,CHAPTER XV,city if duly propitiated.
5884,CHAPTER XV,
5885,CHAPTER XV,Remote Aetolia is far more closely connected with the Tales of Thebes
5886,CHAPTER XV,"and of Troy than is Athens. For some reason, then, Athens, and with her"
5887,CHAPTER XV,"the Ionians, is ""not of the centre,"" is out of the central legends,"
5888,CHAPTER XV,"and her efforts to attach herself to them are late, and are wholly"
5889,CHAPTER XV,un-Homeric. Naturally the really old Epic poets knew nothing of these
5890,CHAPTER XV,"Ionian pretensions, which are the work of Ionian Burkes tampering with"
5891,CHAPTER XV,"the Homeric ""Peerage."" Athens wished to ""have it both ways,"" to appear"
5892,CHAPTER XV,"as a city that had always been held by the same race,[16] that stood"
5893,CHAPTER XV,"apart, and had been the asylum of exiles from the rest of Greece; and"
5894,CHAPTER XV,also as a city that took a great part in the legendary history of the
5895,CHAPTER XV,"rest of Greece, whose traditions did not recognise her share."
5896,CHAPTER XV,
5897,CHAPTER XV,Thus it seems probable that Attica was the seat of a people standing
5898,CHAPTER XV,"somewhat apart, and possessing an older stratum of inhabitants than the"
5899,CHAPTER XV,makers of Achaean saga. But Athens and the Ionians were not content
5900,CHAPTER XV,"with this respectable antiquity. The Ionians of Asia, first, in the"
5901,CHAPTER XV,Cyclic poems (750-600 B.C.) tried to prove that they and neighbouring
5902,CHAPTER XV,"and friendly peoples had their share in the Trojan war; and, next, the"
5903,CHAPTER XV,tragedians of Athens carried on this pseudo-tradition in regard to
5904,CHAPTER XV,Thebes as well as to Troy. Their versions led the world captive for
5905,CHAPTER XV,2000 years. The oldest indications of the Ionian attempts to connect
5906,CHAPTER XV,heroes of Athens and of her neighbours and friends with the Trojan
5907,CHAPTER XV,affair are to be read in the fragments and summaries of the Cyclic
5908,CHAPTER XV,poems.
5909,CHAPTER XV,
5910,CHAPTER XV,"Next, we find this cause taken up by the Athenian tragedians; and,"
5911,CHAPTER XV,"lastly, we find in later sources the fables which the tragedians"
5912,CHAPTER XV,"handled with poetic freedom; while, in the pseudo-Dictys of Crete, we"
5913,CHAPTER XV,"have legends derived from the Cyclic poets, from other sources, and"
5914,CHAPTER XV,"from the author's own fancy. The Roman poets, like Virgil, also reflect"
5915,CHAPTER XV,"the Ionian and Athenian traditions, and their hostility to Agamemnon,"
5916,CHAPTER XV,"Menelaus, Odysseus, and Diomede, with their partiality for Aias,"
5917,CHAPTER XV,"claimed as a neighbour of Athens, and for the ill-used Philoctetes, and"

5989,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",earlier people).
5990,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
5991,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","All this matter is called ""the saga"" by the critics. As Homer comes at"
5992,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the crowning period of epic poetry, as his instrument, the hexameter,"
5993,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","is delicately tempered by long processes, it seems probable that his"
5994,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","mind was full of ancient lays on legendary themes as well, probably,"
5995,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",as of _Märchen_ and traditions told orally in prose. These things are
5996,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",to him what ballads and oral traditions were to Scott. Though he only
5997,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","once, in a suspected passage, touches on the Choice of Paris (_Iliad_,"
5998,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","xxiv, 25-30), he must have known some tale which accounted for the"
5999,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","enmity of Hera to Ilios, and the hatred of Athene to the Asian city"
6000,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","of which she was patroness. Zeus himself (_Iliad_, iv. 31-33) seems"
6001,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",puzzled by the fury of Hera against Troy. _Quo numine laeso_? The cause
6002,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","of wrath is, in fact, _spretae injuria formae_, the spite of neglected"
6003,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","beauty. No other reason (setting aside the favour of Ganymede, to whom"

6005,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6006,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","As to the Trojan affairs, Homer knows many things on which he only"
6007,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",touches briefly. It is clear that he knew a great saga about Trojan
6008,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","legendary history; for example, about the wall built by the Trojans"
6009,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",and Pallas Athene to shelter Heracles when he fought a monster that
6010,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","ravaged the land (_Iliad_, xx. 146). He also knows that Apollo was made"
6011,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","thrall to Laomedon, and built the city wall of Troy, but was defrauded"
6012,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",of his reward (xxi. 441-455). That Apollo and Poseidon therefore sent
6013,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the monster to which Hesione, daughter of Laomedon, was exposed, Homer"
6014,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","does not say; he commonly ignores the _märchenhaft_, the fairy-tale"
6015,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","points in a legend, but he knows that Heracles was also defrauded, and"
6016,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",avenged himself by sacking Ilios (v. 638641). Manifestly there was a
6017,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","rich growth of _Märchen_ and legends clustered round Troy, and known to"
6018,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the Achaeans; Homer merely alludes to it, and to events posterior to"
6019,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",the death of Hector.
6020,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6021,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","He knows how Achilles fell in the Scaean gate, slain by Paris and"

6033,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","or the Athenian tragedians, or the dim genealogisers in verse of the"

6035,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the ""saga,"" or folk-tale, or bardic tradition, what is noble, heroic,"
6036,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","possible, and human. He also, in the _Iliad_, deliberately rejects"

6038,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","old popular _Märchen_, or ""fairy tale."" Later poets put these things"
6039,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",prominently forward; Homer ignores them. This is to be proved later in

6062,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6063,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Homer's heroes are in the same case. There may have been a very early
6064,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Achaean attempt against the northern Asiatic shore of the Aegean.
6065,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",There may have been wars of several States against Thebes. The voyage
6066,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","of the Argo, on the other hand, is nothing but a tissue of diverse"
6067,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","_Märchen_, adroitly fitted into each other, as most formulae can glide"
6068,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",into any other _Märchen_ formula and be prolonged almost infinitely.
6069,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","The Argo saga, as currently told, begins apparently with the tale"
6070,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","of the man who weds a fairy bride or a swan nymph, and later loses"
6071,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","her, like the Eskimo Bird Bride, the Sanskrit Urvasi and Pururavas."
6072,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","In the saga the man is Athamas, king of the Minyae of Orchomenos,"
6073,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","or of Halos in Thessalian Phthiotis, or of Phthia. The bride is"
6074,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Nephele the Cloud-maiden. The pair have two children, Phrixus and"
6075,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Helle. The king takes another wife, and has another child by her. We"

6077,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Nephele returns to the house disguised as an old nurse (_East Lynne_

6081,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",sends messengers to the Delphic oracle to bring back the false answer
6082,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",that Phrixus must be sacrificed. When Athamas is about to sacrifice
6083,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","him, or both him and Helle, Nephele produces as substitute the golden"
6084,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","(or white, or purple) ram, a gift of Hermes. On his back Phrixus, or"

6094,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","water, but revives. In the Greek saga, Helle falls into the Hellespont"
6095,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","off the ram's back: her name is eponymous, derived from the Hellespont."
6096,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",In some variants she does not escape on the ram. The later fortunes of

6105,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","(Orpheus), the winged men, sons of the North Wind, and so on. There"
6106,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","is nothing historic here; even thus, in Celtic saga, the miraculously"
6107,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","gifted heroes hunted the Twrch Trywyth, the boar. Even thus the"
6108,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",miraculously gifted Finnish heroes seek for the mystic Sampo in the
6109,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Kalewala. The Achaean heroes find the fleece in the hands of King

6111,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","(Medea) that aids the young adventurer, and enables him to plough the"

6115,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",this formula ends; the return voyage and the later adventures of the

6171,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Out of these originally anonymous and unlocalised personages and

6181,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the cause of the feud, Neleus refused to purify Heracles who had slain"

6189,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","retained and rejoiced in by the Ionic epic poets, are given later"
6190,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","(""Homer and the Ionian Cyclic Poets""). But Homer, in the _Iliad_, takes"
6191,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",his heroes forth from the prison of _Märchen_: whether the fairy tales
6192,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","had not yet become attached to Bellerophon, Achilles, and Meleager"
6193,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","in his time, or whether his genius ignored such fanciful elements of"
6194,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","tradition, Homer does not speak of the invulnerability of Achilles,"
6195,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","save on his heel; or tell the wooing by his father, Peleus, of Thetis"
6196,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",as she takes a variety of bestial forms. Either these situations had
6197,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","not yet become attached to the story of Achilles, or Homer chooses to"
6198,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",ignore them. Such things do not come into the natural objective world
6199,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",of the _Iliad_. In the digression of Bellerophon he recurs to the
6200,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","human natural side of _Märchen_, the story of the woman who, vainly"
6201,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","attacking a man's virtue, accuses him falsely; the message or letter of"
6202,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","death,[6] his three strange adventures to achieve, that of the Chimaera"
6203,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","and others, and his winning of the king's daughter. This _Märchen_,"
6204,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","localised, is in a digression; but Homer usually keeps his _Märchen_"
6205,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","for the _Odyssey,_ and the incidents occur beyond the bounds of the"
6206,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",world he knows.
6207,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6208,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Now, even when Homer touches on the tale of Meleager, he says nothing"
6209,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","of that fairy property the ""soul-box"" or ""life-token,"" the brand"
6210,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","snatched from the burning; or of the visit of the Spaewives, the Fates,"
6211,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",and their prophecy. He actually does not seem to know that incident.
6212,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Althaea, mother of Meleager, in Homer (_Iliad_, ix. 565-572), prays to"

6214,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","""life-token"" in her hands to burn it, and slay him. In Pausanias (x."
6215,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","31. 3), Meleager is killed by Apollo, who is fighting for the Curetes"
6216,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","against the Aetolians. Meleager died, like Achilles, by Apollo's hand,"
6217,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",though Paris was an accomplice of the God in the case of Achilles.
6218,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Pausanias follows the Hesiodic _Eoiai_, which Kuhnert supposes to have"
6219,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",known the same story as Homer.[7]
6220,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6221,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","As Kuhnert justly observes, the poetry of Homer is _knightly_. ""An"

6224,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",tragedians are our oldest source for the Moirae and the fatal
6225,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",life-token: a property very common in _Märchen_; but when the incident
6226,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",first attached itself to Meleager we cannot know. This avoidance of the
6227,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","folk-element, the _Märchen_, in the _Iliad_ is one of the things that"
6228,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","distinguishes Homer from the Ionian Cyclic poets, the Hesiodic school,"
6229,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",and the Athenian tragedians.
6230,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6231,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Homer, again, in another way, stands apart from the genealogising poets"
6232,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","of the eighth to seventh century (such as the school of ""Hesiod,"" and"
6233,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","""Eumelus"" of Corinth) by his method of handling tradition or saga."
6234,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","These genealogising poets aimed at constructing history, and preluded"
6235,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","to the ""logographers"" in prose of the sixth century. Both they and"
6236,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the logographers have the same simple method, that of the would-be"
6237,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",historic early mediaeval writers on Scotland and Ireland. Their plan
6238,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","is to invent for each town or people an eponymous hero, whose name is"
6239,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","simply the name of the city or people (as, in Scotland, Fib for Fife,"
6240,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Loth for Lothian, Scota for the Scoti). The hero, or heroine, founds"
6241,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the city, or is first ancestor of the people. Next follow the legends"
6242,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","about heroic characters, as Perseus, Athamas, Pelops, Theseus, Aietes,"
6243,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Phrixus, which are mere _Märchen_ of world-wide diffusion, localised,"
6244,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",with named persons for the characters.
6245,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6246,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",The region of legend expands with the expansion of geographical
6247,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","knowledge. Cities hasten, like Athens and Corinth, to attach themselves"
6248,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","to sagas, as that of Argo, in which they had no original part. Hesiod"
6249,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","extends the old saga, and carries descendants of the old characters,"
6250,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","as of Odysseus, to Italy, to Latium and Etruria. ""Eumelus"" drags"
6251,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Corinth into the cycle of the Argonautic expedition: Athens, we have"
6252,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","said, brings Medea to Athens, and into her Theseus fable. Later the"
6253,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","logographers, in prose, continue the process and alter the genealogies"
6254,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",to suit their historical theories.
6255,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6256,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",From all these processes Homer stands apart. He has not any historical
6257,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","theory to prove. He seldom mentions an eponymous founder of a city,"
6258,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","or ancestor of a people. Nausithous founds Phaeacia, his city is not"
6259,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","called Nausithoa. Homer names Mykene (_Odyssey_, ii. 120), but does not"
6260,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","say that she founded Mycenae, as ""Eumelus"" says that Ephyre founded"
6261,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",the town of Ephyre (Corinth). You would not gather from Homer that the
6262,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Achaeans were descendants of Achaeus, or the Danaans of Danaus."
6263,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6264,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",All these things are obvious and undeniable. Homer is a poet: the
6265,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",genealogising writers in verse are aiming at constructing history
6266,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","(_some_ history may be present), and at explaining the origins of"
6267,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",peoples and cities.
6268,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6269,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","But, according to some of the modern learned, our Homer contains"
6270,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",borrowings from the Eumelian verses on Corinth. Thus Mr. Murray says
6271,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","that the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ ""not only refer to other legends as"
6272,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",already existing and treated by other poets; that every one admits; but
6273,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",they often in their digressions tell stories in a form which clearly

6277,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","plain that the poet of _Iliad_, vi., is in the first place referring to"

6280,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6281,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Certainly Homer is referring to an existing legend, and not improbably"
6282,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",to a lay which in his time existed. But Mr. Murray goes on to suggest
6283,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","that the existing poem referred to is the _Corinthiaca_ of ""Eumelus,"""
6284,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",whom he takes to be a mythical name for the author of Corinthian
6285,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",traditional poetry; von Christ thinks Eumelus of the seventh century.
6286,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6287,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Mr. Murray's argument seems to be, Homer knew a legend, probably"
6288,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","knew a poem, about Bellerophon, son of Glaucus, son of Sisyphus, who"
6289,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","dwelt in Ephyre (Corinth). ""Eumelus"" wrote a poem about Corinthian"
6290,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",affairs. Therefore the poet who introduced the tale told by Glaucus
6291,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","into _Iliad_, vi., took it (textually, it seems to be suggested)"
6292,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","from ""Eumelus.""[9] In the same way the author of _Iliad_, v. 395-400,"
6293,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","and Panyassis, the uncle of Herodotus, presumably adapt from the same"
6294,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","source. Mr. Leaf, on the other hand, supposes the poet-uncle to give an"
6295,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","""echo"" from the passage in the fifth book of the _Iliad._ There may be"
6296,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","an echo, in Homer on Heracles, from an older poem on Heracles, but that"
6297,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",poem is likely to be long anterior to the end of the sixth century.[10]
6298,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6299,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","In any case the ""Eumelus"" known to us in Greek literary tradition was"

6324,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6325,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Now, as ""Eumelus"" began (as the Ram in the fairy story is requested"

6330,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","and not the entire mass of Corinthian legend, was the topic of his"
6331,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","book. If so, Bellerophon, though a Corinthian, was ""out of the story"";"
6332,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","for, by the Eumelian genealogies, he was four generations later than"
6333,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Medea's tenure of the Corinthian throne. She was succeeded by Sisyphus,"
6334,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","whose exploits would fill a book; Sisyphus by Glaucus, and Glaucus"

6336,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","attributing to her a share in the tale of Argo; its heroine, Medea,"
6337,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","must therefore be of the Corinthian Royal House; and, after proving"

6339,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","after Argo's return to Greece, in Corinth; and these were many and"
6340,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",tragical.
6341,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6342,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Wishing, then, to attach Corinth to the Argonautic story, the"
6343,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","genealogiser manages matters thus. Helios, the Sun, he says, had two"

6349,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","story about this Antiope (_Od_. xi. 260). Her lover was not Helios,"
6350,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","but Zeus. Her sons were not Aietes and Aloeus, but Amphion and Zethus."

6354,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","The river Asopus, father of Antiope (who was mother, says ""Eumelus,"""
6355,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","by the Sun of Aloeus and Aietes), gave his name as ""Asopia"" to what"

6362,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6363,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",So far we have Eumelian _verse_. How the story went on we learn from
6364,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the _prose_ version cited by Pausanias. Bounos died as king of Ephyre,"
6365,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",and was succeeded by the nephew of Aietes (a son of his brother
6366,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Aloeus), named Epopeus.[15] Epopeus was harsh to _his_ son Marathon,"
6367,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",and Marathon fled to Attica and founded the famous deme of Marathon. He
6368,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","had two sons, Sicyon, to whom, on the death of his own father, Epopeus,"
6369,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",he gave Sicyon; while Ephyre he gave to his son Corinthus; hence
6370,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Ephyre came to be called Corinth. When Corinthus died childless, the"
6371,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Corinthians sent to Colchis for Medea, in accordance with the entail"
6372,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","made by Aietes (as ""Eumelus"" has told us in verse), when he left"

6374,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6375,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","The ""Eumelus"" of whom we have reports wrote pseudo-history in verse,"
6376,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","for he has to make Medea survive Aietes, Bounos, Epopeus, Marathon,"
6377,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","and Corinthus, and then, in the prime of beauty, succeed to the realm"
6378,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",of Corinthus as Queen of Corinth. Leaving Corinth for Athens under a
6379,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","cloud, Medea gives Corinth to Sisyphus.[17]"
6380,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6381,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","""Eumelus,"" as Seeliger observes,[18] knows the Argo story in the common"
6382,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","late expanded form, Colchis and all; but chooses to make Aietes,"
6383,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","contrary to all other authorities, a king of Corinth. Attica, too,"
6384,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","must needs attach herself to the story of Argo, by making Medea seduce"
6385,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","King Aegeus, the father of Theseus, and try to poison Theseus himself:"
6386,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",she also made Aegeus send him on the desperate adventure of fighting
6387,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",the Bull of Marathon.[19] This Bull of Marathon _donne à penser_. In
6388,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","one legend Aegeus, father of Theseus, sent Androgeos, son of Minos, to"
6389,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","fight the bull, which killed him. It was therefore but tit-for-tat when"
6390,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Minos sent Athenian tributary boys and girls to fight _his_ bull, the"

6392,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6393,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","""Eumelus,"" as far as our evidence goes, stands for the school who,"

6396,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","lines. When ""Eumelus"" had got his pseudo-history and false genealogies"
6397,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","to his taste, he must have told at full length the tale of Argo, for we"
6398,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",have five lines of his describing the terror caused in Aietes and the
6399,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Colchians by the throwing of the weight by Jason among the armed brood
6400,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","born of the plain, which Jason ploughed with fire-breathing bulls."
6401,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6402,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","These things, then, are what Greek literary tradition reports about"
6403,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","a pseudo-historical genealogist, and teller of the tale of Argo with"
6404,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",a purpose. That he ever mentioned Bellerophon we have no proof:
6405,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Pausanias does not cite Eumelus for Bellerophon. Homer, as usual, omits"
6406,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the _Märchen_ of the winged horse Pegasus, whereby, in later poems,"
6407,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Bellerophon accomplishes his feats. Pindar is copious about Pegasus:
6408,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","that noble animal. The peculiarly gifted horse, hard to bridle, is"
6409,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","common property of ""fairy tales."" Usually some friendly person tells"
6410,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",the adventurous lad to use a peculiar bridle without which the steed is
6411,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","untamable. The boy can always sell the horse, but keep the bridle; the"
6412,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","purchaser returns the nag, and the hero keeps the money. In Pindar's"
6413,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Fourth Pythian Ode, Athene is the benevolent person of the _Märchen_."
6414,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Bellerophon, wanting to break in Pegasus, sleeps in her temple; she"
6415,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",presents him with the magical golden bit and head-stall. Dropping
6416,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Pegasus, magical bridle and all, Homer only says that the gods ""gave"
6417,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Bellerophon friendly convoy to Lycia.""[21] Mr. Murray asks, ""What"
6418,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","blameless guiding of the gods led Bellerophon to Lycia?"" Clearly he"
6419,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","flew thither through upper air on Pegasus, like Commodore Trunnion"
6420,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","leaping a sunken way on the road to the hymeneal altar, ""to the"
6421,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","unspeakable terror and amazement"" of a waggoner below, says Smollett."
6422,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","But Homer is not Smollett, and does not send Bellerophon flying through"
6423,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",air on a horse. Pindar saw no objections to the incident.[22]
6424,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6425,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Here we must try to explain a point on which Mr. Murray remarks, ""There"
6426,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",has been an extraordinary reluctance among scholars to ... admit the
6427,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","possibility of 'Homer,' as the phrase is, borrowing from the supposed"
6428,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","later author 'Eumelus,' or even from 'Hesiod.'"" The reluctance is"
6429,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","natural and justifiable; because when we say ""Eumelus"" or ""Hesiod,"" we"
6430,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",mean just what we have received from antiquity under the names of these
6431,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","men. Their work, as it reaches us, is un-Homeric, is later, we say,"
6432,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","than the _Iliad_. But if ""Eumelus"" be a mythical name for a supposed"
6433,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",author of a body of Corinthian heroic poetry: if the Eumelian matter
6434,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","which we have received was not that, then we know nothing about that,"
6435,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",and cannot say whether our Homer borrowed from some other Eumelian
6436,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","_epê_ or not. Mr. Murray, as to Homer's debt to ""Eumelus,"" writes: ""If"
6437,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","anything were needed to make it clearer still, it would be that the"
6438,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Verses of Eumelus are quoted as the earliest authority for the story
6439,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","of the Argo and Medea, and the composer of our _Odyssey_ speaks of"
6440,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the Argo as a subject of which 'all minds are full'""[23] The reader"
6441,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",naturally gathers that our Homer took his information about Argo from
6442,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","""Eumelus."" We can only say, ""not from the Eumelus known to us in Greek"
6443,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","literary tradition."" Thus Hesiod[24] tells of the birth of Circe and"
6444,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Aietes her brother (the father of Medea) in precisely the same terms as
6445,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Homer does, and as Eumelus does not.[25] Both poets say that Helios, by"
6446,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","_Perses_ (Homer), or _Perseis_ (Hesiod), a daughter of Oceanus, was the"
6447,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","father of Circe and Aietes. Homer does not mention Medea, but Hesiod"
6448,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","says that she was the daughter of Aietes. Now Eumelus, in what we have"
6449,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","of him, says nothing of Circe, but makes Aietes the son of Helios and"
6450,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Antiope, _not_ of Perses as in Homer. Manifestly, then, Homer did not"
6451,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","take his version from _this_ Eumelus; while, when Homer and Hesiod"
6452,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","precisely agree, if either borrowed from the other, it were quite"
6453,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","arbitrary to say that Homer borrowed from Hesiod, who knows Latium and"
6454,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Etruria.
6455,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6456,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Homer certainly did not borrow here from our Eumelus, for he differs"
6457,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","from Eumelus; nor is Eumelus quoted, as far as I am aware, ""as the"
6458,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","earliest authority for"" the story of Argo. The scholiast on Pindar,"
6459,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","as I, for one, understand him, quotes Eumelus for something quite"
6460,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","different, namely, for his peculiar account (adopted by Pindar when"
6461,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",praising a Corinthian athlete) of Medea as rightful Queen of Corinth;
6462,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","a point on which no Greeks agreed with the patriotic chronicler, the"
6463,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Corinthian Eumelus, as Pausanias observes."
6464,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6465,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Homer knows about the ship Argo, and her escape from the clash of the"
6466,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Rocks Wandering, through the favour of Hera.[26] The dangers of these"
6467,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","rocks are described by Circe to Odysseus, for he must pass by that"
6468,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","perilous path of the sea; and Circe ought to know, for she is sister of"
6469,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","King Aietes, from whose land Argo was sailing when she met the rocks."
6470,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",But where did Aietes dwell? On that point Homer says nothing and knew
6471,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",nothing.
6472,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6473,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","It is manifest that Homer neither knows where Aiaie, the isle of"
6474,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Circe, is, nor where the home of King Aietes is. To him Aiaie is ""an"
6475,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","unsubstantial fairy place."" In the _Odyssey_ (xii. 3, 4), Circe's"
6476,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","isle is ""near the home and dancing-places of the Dawn, and the land"
6477,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","of sunrising."" You cannot go farther east in a black ship. But in"
6478,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Hesiod,[27] Circe's Aia must be in the west, for her sons by Odysseus"
6479,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",(unheard of by Homer) rule over Latins and Tyrsenians. Later poets
6480,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","placed the Aia of Circe's brother, Aietes, in the east, in Colchis, at"
6481,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",the eastern limit of the Euxine; and Circe's Aia they located in the
6482,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","west, at the promontory of Circeei in Italy. Homer himself shows no"
6483,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","knowledge of Italy, on one side, or of the extremity of the Euxine on"
6484,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the other.[28] Even Mimnermus places the city of Aietes vaguely ""at the"
6485,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","limit of Oceanus.""[29] By way of finding reason where there is none,"
6486,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Apollonius Rhodius explains that Circe originally lived in the Aia of
6487,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the east, as in the _Odyssey_, but was transported by Helios to the Aia"
6488,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","in the west.[30] Homer being so vague, we do not say he is borrowing"
6489,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","from our Eumelus, who locates Aietes in Colchis, under Caucasus, which"
6490,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Homer, if pre-Ionian, never knew. Had Homer, or any of the supposed"
6491,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","late contributors to the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_, lived in the eighth to"
6492,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","seventh centuries, and studied our Eumelus, or even our Hesiod, the"
6493,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",_Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ would have had much more extensive geographical
6494,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",knowledge than they possess. No one will say that our Homer borrows
6495,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","from a genealogiser like our Eumelus, when Eumelus does not even agree"
6496,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",with Homer about the mother of Aietes.
6497,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6498,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","The _Iliad_ does know that Jason, in the isle of Lemnos, had a son by"
6499,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Hypsipyle;[31] and the adventures of the Argonauts in Lemnos are part
6500,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",of the story of Argo. But Lemnos is well within Homer's geographical
6501,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","knowledge, while the homes of Aietes and Circe are far beyond its"
6502,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",limits.
6503,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6504,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",The confusion of early mythical geography is inextricable. In the
6505,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",_Odyssey_ the ship Argo met the Rocks Wandering on her way home from

6507,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","in the farthest east; so then, it seems, did Aietes. In Pindar,[32]"
6508,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Argo encounters the rocks on her outward and eastward way, before she"
6509,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","enters the Euxine. Homer knows that Jason loved Hypsipyle in Lemnos,"
6510,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",whether on his way to or his return from Aietes. Pindar says on his
6511,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","return westward to Greece, after he has visited Oceanus, the Red Sea,"
6512,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","and Africa. The common story, as in Apollonius Rhodius, makes Jason"
6513,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",love Hypsipyle in Lemnos as he sails eastwards and outward bound to
6514,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Colchis. If he wooed her thus, on his way home, _with Medea,_ as"

6517,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Let us next, before going deeper into the ""Saga,"" examine the case"

6604,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Murray follows Bethe in _The Rise of the Greek Epic_. We may take a
6605,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","notable example of the method in the case of Hector. ""Hector seems to"
6606,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","belong to Boeotia."" It may be worth while to examine the reasoning"
6607,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",on which this most unexpected opinion is based. The idea was first
6608,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",propounded by Ferdinand Dümmler in a short _Anhang_ to Studniczka's
6609,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","_Cyrene._ ""Hector was worshipped as a hero in Boeotian Thebes,"" says"
6610,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Mr. Murray, quoting Dümmler, and Dümmler's source is apparently"
6611,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Pausanias.[38] If the Boeotians in the time of Pausanias regarded
6612,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Hector as of Boeotian birth, the fact would be curious. But they did"
6613,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","nothing of the kind. ""The Thebans show the tomb of Hector near the"
6614,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Well of Oedipous. They say that Hector's remains were brought here
6615,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","from Ilium in accordance with the following oracle: ""Ye Thebans, if"
6616,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","you wish your country to be wealthy, bring to your city from Asia the"

6619,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6620,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",This was a real or an _imaginary_ case of the body-snatching of which
6621,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Herodotus speaks frequently. The relics of St. Hector would be valuable
6622,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","to Thebes. The Thebans, in fact, may have wished to propitiate a hero"
6623,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","who had slain, according to Homer, many Boeotians in battle, and who"
6624,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","might still be hostile, and even fight against them in battle, as"
6625,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","dead heroes were apt to do. Pausanias (ix. 4. 3, ix. 39. 3) mentions"
6626,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","also the graves of certain Boeotian heroes, one of them wounded, the"
6627,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","other slain by Hector, as still honoured in Boeotia. Hector slew, or"
6628,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","wounded, or fought Homeric heroes from Phocis and from Boeotia; and"
6629,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Epeigeus, a suppliant of Peleus (_Iliad_, xvi. 570 _et seqq_.), and"
6630,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","an Aetolian hero, an Athenian, a Mycenaean, an Elian, and so on."
6631,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","What follows? These names of heroes slain by Hector, Thessalians,"
6632,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Aetolians, Phocians, and Boeotians, are thought to suggest that, as"
6633,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Mr. Murray translates Dr. Bethe, ""Hector, or rather the tribe which"

6635,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","which these Aetolians, Thessalians, Phocians, and Boeotians--or the"
6636,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","tribes which honoured them as heroes--used to live. ""More accurately,"
6637,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the tribe gradually, in how many centuries none can tell, moved in"

6640,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","""These are no pictures of phantasy that I let loose to play about"

6642,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6643,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",What else but phantasies can we possibly call them? That Hector's tomb
6644,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","was shown in Thebes, does by no means prove that he, or a tribe which"
6645,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","was the Hector tribe, once lived in Boeotia. Heroes, like saints,"
6646,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","had tombs and chapels in many regions where they were not born, and"
6647,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",which they never visited. The grave of St. James was shown--in Spain!
6648,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Ariadne's ashes had been shown in Argos. Hector, in the _Iliad_, killed"
6649,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the men in his way. In addition to the victims chosen out by Dr. Bethe,"
6650,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","he slew Stichios, an Athenian; Amphimachus, an Elian, and Periphetes of"
6651,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Mycenae.[40]
6652,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6653,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",This does no more prove that Hector was a Boeotian than that he was an
6654,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Athenian. He slew Schedios, a Phocian, yet he was no more a Phocian"
6655,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","than an Athenian, he merely killed the men whom he met. If we are"
6656,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","to argue, that he or the tribe which honoured him was driven out of"
6657,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Aetolia and Thessaly down to Boeotia, Phocis, and Attica, we must,"
6658,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","by parity of reasoning, argue that the Hector tribe (in Gaelic, the"
6659,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","MacEachans), were driven into Peloponnesus, to Mycenae and Elis, for"
6660,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Hector slew Periphetes of Mycenae, and Amphimachus, of Elis.[41] The"
6661,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Mycenaean, Elian, and Athenian are not mentioned by Dr. Bethe. Nor can"
6662,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Hector be converted into a Boeotian by the circumstance that he fought
6663,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","a kind of courteous duel with Aias, while Aias was really the Locrian"
6664,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Aias, we are told, and so a neighbour of the Boeotian Hector.[42]"
6665,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Hector's relations with Aias[43] are far from neighbourly and friendly.
6666,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6667,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",This instance of Hector is one of many in which the names of heroes are
6668,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","taken to represent ""tribes"" which had a cult of these heroes, though"
6669,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Homer knows nothing about this cult as practised in heroic Greece,"
6670,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","except in Athens. We learn nothing from Homer about ""tribes"" or clans"
6671,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","with a sacred eponymous hero, or with any ""hero"" in the sense of the"
6672,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",word as used in the Greece of history. We cannot assume that the
6673,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","_Iliad_ introduces, in the combats of heroes, memories of tribal wars"
6674,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","in Greece in the pre-Homeric age, and transfers them, in the shape of"
6675,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","single combats, to the plain of Troy!"
6676,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6677,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Heroic relationships were claimed long after Homer by peoples like
6678,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the Dorians and Romans and English and many others, merely to connect"
6679,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",themselves with the great legend of Troy; and the Greek cults of
6680,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","heroes, a religion unknown to Homer, were carried into regions with"
6681,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",which Homer's men had no connection. We might as well look for Cymric
6682,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",tribal wars in the feuds and names of the knights in the Arthurian
6683,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","romances, or for Irish tribal feuds in the names of Ferdiad and"

6685,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Leltus, Stichios of Attica, Periphetes of Mycenae, and Amphimachus of"

6691,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Elis by way of Athens: that is the history of the tribe, preserved"
6692,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","in the names of his victims,--names which, it appears, ""are short"""
6693,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","for defeated tribes. As for the evidence of a Helen tribe at Sparta,"
6694,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","because Helen had a shrine and worship there, we have no evidence that"
6695,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","the Achaeans had any heroic shrines or hero-worship,--the evidence"
6696,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","is that they had none,--but the assumption is that Homer represents"
6697,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","""another stream of history,"" and, apparently, that his people turned"
6698,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","tribal names and tribal gods of an unknown past, into heroic men and"
6699,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",women. The opposite theory is that the hero-worshipping people of
6700,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",historic Greece devoted themselves to such patron saints as they knew
6701,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","through Homer, as the Arabs have saints whom they know about through"
6702,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",the Hebrew Scriptures.
6703,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6704,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","I am not aware that in the bardic history, or ""saga"" of any people,"
6705,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",tribes are spoken of under the names of their tribal heroes in such a
6706,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","way as to cause confusion. None is caused by Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim,"
6707,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","and so on in the Old Testament, but in other Biblical cases there may"
6708,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","be trouble. Local _tribes_, as far as I am aware, are nowhere named"
6709,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","by patronymics; certainly they are not in Australia, India, America,"
6710,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","and Africa, except, among the Zulus, by the name of a man plus Ama,"
6711,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","AmaFinn, and so forth. Thus the theory that Hector is the name of a"
6712,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",prehistoric Boeotian local tribe seems to me fantastic. We might as
6713,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","well look for remnants of tribal history in Kay, Gawaine, Naimes, and"
6714,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Ganelon.
6715,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",
6716,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",Surely it is an error in historical method to reason as if pre-Homeric
6717,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Greeks were as addicted to divinising men, building their shrines, and"
6718,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","sacrificing to them, as the post-Homeric Greeks were in the seventh"
6719,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""",and all later centuries. We might as well argue that the apostolic
6720,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","Christians practised mediaeval saint-worship, and adored and built"
6721,"HOMER AND ""THE SAGA""","innumerable chapels to dead Saints, because this was the custom of"

6874,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"There is one hero of the Cyclic Ionian poems, at least of the _Cypria_,"
6875,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,whose story illustrates the depth and width of the gulf which severs
6876,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Ionia from the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_. The _Cypria_, like the Attic"
6877,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"traditions used by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and the Sophists,"
6878,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"such as Gorgias, displays a strange hatred of Homer's favourite hero,"
6879,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"the taker of the city, Odysseus. He, in most of the plays where he"
6880,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"appears, is a peculiarly mean character: in the _Iliad_ he is as noble"
6881,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"and resolute as he is sagacious: in the _Odyssey_ he is _ruse_, because"
6882,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"his desperate situation, alone in a throng of foes, requires cunning."
6883,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Only Agamemnon once, in one of his tempers, accused Odysseus of ""evil"
6884,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"wiles"" _(Iliad_, iv. 339). Professor Mahaffy has offered an explanation"
6885,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"of ""the degradation of Odysseus"" (and of other Homeric heroes) ""in"
6886,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Greek literature"" very different from that which I shall venture to"
6887,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"suggest.[1] Mr. Mahaffy thinks that ""the Attic standard of morality,"
6888,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,the standard of Aeschylus and Euripides ... was higher and not lower
6889,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"than that of the Ionic court poets, and that the degradation of the"
6890,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Homeric heroes was partly owing to a moral advance, and not a moral"
6891,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"decay, in the Greek nation."" But what has Homer to do with the morality"
6892,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"of Ionic court poets, about whom we have no information, unless the"
6893,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Cyclic poets were court poets? In Mr. Mahaffy's opinion, the Sicilian"
6894,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Epicharmus began the attacks on ""Odysseus the Knave."" ""At all epochs"
6895,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"and among all Greeks, lying and dishonesty were prominent vices."""
6896,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,Certainly they were in historic times. Traitors were too well known
6897,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"to historic Greece, but Homer seems never to have heard of treachery."
6898,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Odysseus has his ruses in the _Odyssey_, and therefore, Mr. Mahaffy"
6899,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"thinks, the Greeks, knowing their own weak point, falseness, attacked"
6900,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"it through Odysseus. Epicharmus began the assault, Pindar followed"
6901,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Epicharmus, and, in the Nemean Odes, vii. viii., belittled Odysseus"
6902,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"(all in the interests of honesty), while Sophocles in the _Philoctetes_"
6903,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,carries on the crusade.
6904,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
6905,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"It did not occur to Mr. Mahaffy that the crusade began, long before"
6906,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Epicharmus and Pindar, in the Ionian _Cypria_. In the Nemean Odes, vii."
6907,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"viii., Pindar naturally belittled Odysseus, to whom were awarded the"
6908,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"arms of Achilles, which the hero, Aias, desired to win. Athens always"
6909,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"claimed Aias as a friend and ally, wherefore, and in pursuance, as we"
6910,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"shall see, of the feud of Palamedes, Attic poets favoured Aias and"
6911,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,maligned his successful rival. They also backed Philoctetes against
6912,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"these ""tyrants,"" the Atridae; they had no grudge against Achilles,"
6913,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,though they could not represent his chivalry. Mr. Mahaffy does not
6914,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"mention Palamedes at all, does not see that the Athenians take up"
6915,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"the Ionian grudge, and is ""somewhat impatient of all the fashionable"

6917,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"feeling."""
6918,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
6919,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"It is to Ionia, and not, primarily, to the advanced morality of"
6920,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"republican Athens, morality certainly not Homeric, that we must trace"
6921,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,the degradation of Odysseus in the literature of later Greece and of
6922,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Rome. Ionia followed the example of the base-born Thersites (_Iliad,_"
6923,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"ii. 220). The true cause of this degradation is that Ionia possessed,"
6924,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"in Palamedes, a hero infinitely wiser, braver, and more learned and"
6925,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"inventive than Odysseus, and that the death of this very perfect"
6926,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"knight, of whom Homer never says a word, is attributed to the jealousy"
6927,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"and cruelty of the Ithacan, and of his chosen companion-in-arms,"
6928,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Diomede. All this appeared in the _Cypria,_ and, later, Attic wits"
6929,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"perhaps improved on the story, and implicated the Atridae and the whole"
6930,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Achaean host, as well as Odysseus, in the guilt of maligning, falsely"
6931,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"accusing, condemning, and stoning Palamedes. It was to punish this"
6932,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"collective guilt, we shall see, that Zeus, in the _Cypria_, detached"
6933,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,Achilles from the Achaean cause.
6934,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
6935,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Manifestly all this tale, known to us first in the _Cypria_, is"
6936,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"un-Achaean and un-Homeric, and the question arises, did Homer know"
6937,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"the story? If he did, and if he believed it, he deliberately chose"
6938,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"to ignore it, and to represent Odysseus and Diomede in the most"
6939,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,favourable light. But did Homer know about Palamedes; when Homer sang
6940,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"had Palamedes his place in the Trojan ""saga""? I think not, for reasons"
6941,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"to be given. To understand the subject, we must examine what remains"
6942,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,of the tale of Palamedes as found in the fragments and epitome of the
6943,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"_Cypria_, and then consider the later expansions and additions."
6944,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
6945,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,The _Cypria_ takes Menelaus to Crete before Helen's abduction; and in
6946,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,the legend as arranged in a late age in the prose of Dictys Cretensis
6947,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"(made in the first or second century A.D.), Agamemnon also is in Crete,"
6948,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"with Palamedes, son of Clymene and Nauplius of Nauplia, on business"
6949,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,connected with the inheritance of Atreus. How far Dictys follows the
6950,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"_Cypria_, how far he works here on other legends, and how far he"
6951,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"invents, it is not easy to be certain. The _Cypria_ certainly yielded"
6952,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"the fact that, when Helen eloped, Menelaus was not at home, but in"
6953,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,Crete. Probably the _Cypria_ explained why he went thither.[2] The
6954,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"real hero of Dictys and, I suggest, of the _Cypria_ is Palamedes, a"
6955,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"character unknown to or ignored by Homer, but of high importance in"
6956,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,post-Homeric Ionian and Athenian poetry. In all of these Palamedes is
6957,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"the best man in council and in the field, and is the victim of Odysseus"
6958,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,(a very base scoundrel) and of the Atridae. It is clear that Palamedes
6959,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"occupied a prominent place in the _Cypria_, for a ""part or rhapsody"" in"
6960,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"it ""appears to have borne the special title of _Palamedeia_.""[3]"
6961,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
6962,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,This rhapsody must have contained much information which is not
6963,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,preserved in the summary of the _Cypria_. About Palamedes we learn no
6964,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,more from the brief epitome and scanty fragments of the _Cypria_ than
6965,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"that (1) he detected and unmasked the feigned madness of Odysseus, when"
6966,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,he tried to shirk the summons to the Trojan war; (2) that Palamedes was
6967,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"treacherously drowned, when angling, by the Homeric companions-in-arms,"
6968,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Odysseus and Diomede. (3) According to the _Cypria_, the Achaean host,"
6969,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"once landed in Asia, was perishing for lack of supplies, but Palamedes"
6970,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,brought to the camp the three fairy daughters of the Delian priest
6971,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"of Apollo, who magically produced corn, wine, and oil.[4] This silly"
6972,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,_Märchen_ about the fairy gifts of the three girls could never have
6973,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"been introduced into an Epic by Homer, but it is quite in the manner of"
6974,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,the Cyclics.
6975,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
6976,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"According to the account of Trojan matters in prose, by the Greek"
6977,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"rhetorician, the pseudo-Dictys Cretensis, who rationalises everything,"
6978,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Palamedes was successful as head of the Commissariat, and obtained"
6979,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,supplies when Odysseus failed. This is merely Dictys' way of narrating
6980,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"the _Märchen_ of the girls with fairy gifts, and it was in jealousy"
6981,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"of Palamedes' success that Odysseus, aided by Diomede, slew the hero,"
6982,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"according to Dictys, treacherously, in the manner of the _Märchen_ of"
6983,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Jean de l'Ours. According to Dictys, Odysseus and Diomede persuaded"
6984,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,the guileless Palamedes that there was a hoard of gold at the bottom of
6985,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"a pit, induced him to descend thither, and then threw down stones and"
6986,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"slew him. This is not, as we shall see, the Attic tradition, though in"
6987,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"that, also, there is a fatal hoard of gold, and Palamedes is slain by"
6988,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,stoning.
6989,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
6990,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"The Athenian tragedians either improved on the story in the _Cypria_,"
6991,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"or found another legend, according to which Palamedes was treacherously"
6992,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"accused of treachery, was tried, condemned, and stoned by the Achaean"
6993,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"host: Odysseus being the contriver of the conspiracy. Thus Socrates, in"
6994,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"the _Apologia_, is made by Plato to say that in the next world he hopes"
6995,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"to meet Palamedes, and the Telamonian Aias, and others who died by an"
6996,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,unjust judgment.[5]
6997,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
6998,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,Each of the three great Attic tragedians wrote a play on Palamedes; and
6999,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Virgil makes Sinon speak of his unjust betrayal and death.[6] Aias, in"
7000,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Quintus Smyrnaeus, brands Odysseus with his guilt in the matter: ""Thou"
7001,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"didst destroy the divine Palamedes, far thy superior in strength and in"
7002,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"counsel.""[7] The current Athenian story was that Odysseus contrived to"
7003,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"have an arrow, with a letter attached to it, shot towards Palamedes;"
7004,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"that Odysseus got possession of the letter, forged by himself but"
7005,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"purporting to be addressed by Priam, to Palamedes. Priam thanked him"
7006,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"for his services as a spy, and promised a gift of gold. This gold was"
7007,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"then hidden by Odysseus in the hut of Palamedes, and then discovered by"
7008,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,him who hid it.[8] Agamemnon was implicated in the job.
7009,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
7010,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,In the _Palamedes_ of Euripides the hero is not unavenged. His brother
7011,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Oiax writes the shameful story of the Achaean treachery and cruelty,"
7012,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"which ruined and destroyed Palamedes, on a number of _pinakes,_ or"
7013,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"tablets, like that which contained the fatal letter of Proetus in the"
7014,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,_Iliad_. These tablets Oiax threw into the sea; some of them drifted to
7015,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Nauplia, and the friends of Palamedes, by altering the guiding beacons"
7016,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"on the Greek coast, caused the shipwreck and death of many Achaeans on"
7017,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,their homeward way.[9]
7018,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
7019,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Manifestly the whole scope of this Ionian and Attic favourite, the"
7020,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"story of Palamedes, is non-Achaean, and was not likely to be known to"
7021,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,Homer.
7022,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
7023,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"In Dictys, Palamedes is the true hero, and on every occasion takes"
7024,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"the lead; while Odysseus, the scoundrel, is an inveterate forger of"
7025,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,letters. By forged letters he induced Clytaemnestra to send Iphigeneia
7026,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"to marry Achilles at Aulis, his real purpose being to have her"
7027,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"sacrificed to Artemis. In the _Cypria_, Iphigeneia is sent, on a false"
7028,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"and foolish pretence of marriage, to Aulis; whether or not, in the"
7029,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"_Cypria_, Odysseus managed the plot by forged letters, as in Dictys, we"
7030,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,do not know.
7031,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
7032,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,Through Dictys and through Virgil the Palamedes legend reached the
7033,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"poets and romancers of the Middle Ages: there is even a Palamedes, a"
7034,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"paynim knight, at Arthur's court. Thus in Roman times, and much more in"
7035,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"the long mediaeval period of Homer's eclipse, Odysseus, Diomede, and"
7036,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"the Atridae were under a cloud, Ionian in origin, and Athenian. The"
7037,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Ionians being ""Pelasgians of the seacoast"" (at least in the opinion of"
7038,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Herodotean Greece), and Palamedes being a man of Nauplia, on the sea,"
7039,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"while the town was leagued with Athens, in the amphictyony of Calauria,"
7040,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,he was naturally a favourite of Ionian and Athenian poets. In him they
7041,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"had a hero, the wisest and best, who perished from Achaean envy of his"
7042,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,greatness.
7043,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
7044,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Now, did Homer know anything of Nauplia and of Palamedes? Was this"
7045,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"legend current in his time? If so, he ignored it, as Achaean poetry"
7046,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,ignores all things Ionian. It was necessary for the Ionian poets to
7047,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"kill Palamedes just before the opening of the _Iliad_, for into that"
7048,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,epic they could neither foist him nor anything that was theirs. In
7049,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Shakespeare's _Troilus and Cressida_, Palamedes is fighting hard in"
7050,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,what answers to the Iliadic battle of Book xi.
7051,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
7052,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,I am inclined under correction to suppose that Palamedes was originally
7053,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"no warrior under Ilios, but a Culture Hero of the ""Pelasgians of the"
7054,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"seacoasts,"" the Culture Hero of a fairly advanced civilisation. He was"
7055,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"credited with the discovery of written characters,[10] or, at least,"
7056,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,of a syllabary; or he taught the Greeks to use Phoenician characters
7057,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"in the Ionian alphabet. He also discovered arithmetic, Weights and"
7058,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Measures; Astronomy; the reckoning of Time; military discipline,--with"
7059,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"post-Homeric centurions;--sentinels, fire-signals; a number of games,"
7060,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"such as draughts, and so forth. Homer knows nothing of such Culture"
7061,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Heroes in the Achaean camp, where they are manifestly out of place."
7062,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
7063,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"It has been suggested that Palamedes is Palamaon, an ancient understudy"
7064,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"of Hephaestus; [Greek: palamêma] being [Greek: _technê_], art, or"
7065,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"handicraft, and [Greek: _palamis_] the Salaminian equivalent of"
7066,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"[Greek: technitês]. Palamedes is properly ""the Inventor."" I suggest"
7067,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"that, in the mixed multitude of Ionia, poets were found who simply"
7068,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"inserted the old Culture Hero among the Achaean heroes, and asserted"
7069,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"his supremacy in counsel and in war; while, as has been said, it was"
7070,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"impossible to bring him into the _Iliad,_ so he was made the martyr of"
7071,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,the jealousy of Homer's bravest and wisest Achaeans at the moment just
7072,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"before the _Iliad_ begins. In the opinion of Socrates, Aias, no less"
7073,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"than Palamedes, was the victim of an unjust verdict, a belief which he"
7074,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,never found in Homer. But Aias was claimed as an ally and neighbour
7075,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,of Athens; Palamedes was of a seacoast city allied with Athens; both
7076,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"heroes, therefore, were useful links between the Ionians and Attica"
7077,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"and the Trojan affair, in which, as in the legendary affairs of Thebes"
7078,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"and Calydon, the Ionians had no part, except what they invented for"
7079,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,themselves.
7080,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
7081,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"They imposed their version on Rome and on the Middle Ages, but we"
7082,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"repeat, they could not get a reference to Palamedes into the _Iliad_."
7083,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Among all its alleged borrowings from the Cyclics, the _Iliad_ never"
7084,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,borrowed a hint of Palamedes.[11]
7085,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
7086,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"After thus examining what is known about Palamedes, we ask, is it more"
7087,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"probable that the _Cypria_ is older than the _Iliad_, and based on a"
7088,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,totally different Achaean tradition about events and heroes; or is
7089,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"the _Cypria_ later than the _Iliad_, and even intended as a kind of"
7090,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"antidote to that epic? One thing is clear, the _Cypria_ is Ionian, not"
7091,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Achaean, if human sacrifice is Ionian rather than Achaean. Students who"
7092,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,think the _Cypria_ the older poem might perhaps argue thus: Many of
7093,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,the mixed peoples who made up the Ionians had ancestors at the Trojan
7094,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"war. Among these were Minyans, Boeotians, and Cretans. Their legends"
7095,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,may have had an _Achaean_ version of events which was not Homer's

7097,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"version, Ionised, is given in the _Cypria._ Probably this version was"
7098,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,continued (though we have no such continuation) from the resolve of
7099,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,Zeus to punish the host for the death of Palamedes: and the subsequent
7100,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"account, in this version of the war, would take no notice of the Wrath"
7101,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"of Achilles about Briseis. Or, if that were assumed as the cause of the"
7102,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Wrath, Zeus embroiled Achilles and Agamemnon without any prayer from"
7103,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Thetis. Probably in this version, as in Dictys, Achilles was in love"
7104,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"with Polyxena, and was treacherously slain while wooing her. This is"
7105,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"the statement of the scholiast on Lycophron, and of Dictys, though it"
7106,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"is contrary to the Cyclic _Aethiopis,_ which follows the _Iliad_; Paris"
7107,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"and Apollo slew Achilles, as Hector prophesied, in the Scaean gate."
7108,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,On this theory Polyxena was sacrificed to the dead Achilles precisely
7109,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,because they loved each other.
7110,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
7111,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Thus the theory might go on, explaining that _this_ Achaean version"
7112,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"(wholly unknown to us), with Palamedes and all, was crushed by the"
7113,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"supreme popularity of a later poem, the _Iliad_, but lived in an"
7114,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"underground way till it revived, very late, in Lycophron, Dictys, and"
7115,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"the rest. The details of ghosts, human sacrifices, hero-worship, and"
7116,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"purification by blood (all un-Homeric), will be genuinely old Achaean,"
7117,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"merely suppressed by some persons of taste who, later, ""edited"" the"
7118,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,_Iliad_. In this case these details of religion were common to the
7119,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Achaeans and the earlier populations, _not_ peculiar to ""the conquered"
7120,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"races."" They are Achaean, but were expurgated by the makers of _our_"
7121,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"Homer, why, and when, and how, I do not conjecture."
7122,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,
7123,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,I have here invented as coherent a hypothesis as I can imagine to
7124,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,account for Palamedes consistently with the theory that the _Cypria_ is
7125,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"older than the _Iliad_. But the fact that Palamedes, ""the inventor,"" is"
7126,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"clearly, in origin, a Culture Hero, like Prometheus and Daedalus, does"
7127,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,to me seem fatal to the hypothesis which I have sketched. If he had
7128,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,"been, originally, just another such warrior as Achilles or Idomeneus,"
7129,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,popular fancy would never have converted him into a being who won men
7130,THE STORY OF PALAMEDES,from savagery and invented arts and sciences.

7168,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Few subjects are more recalcitrant to lucidity of treatment than the
7169,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"so-called ""Cyclic poems."" On the various meanings of the word ""Cyclic"""
7170,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"as applied to poetry by the ancients, very much has been written.[1]"
7171,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Into that question we need not enter, as we here call ""Cyclic"" all"
7172,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,these old epics on the Trojan theme (outside of the _Iliad_ and
7173,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Odyssey_) of which we have only fragments, in quotations by later"
7174,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Greek writers, and in fragmentary epitomes. Though these remains,"
7175,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"including the prose of the Greek authors who cite and comment on them,"
7176,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"occupy but forty-five pages of a book in small octavo,[2] the fragments"
7177,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,suffice to prove that the lost epics are far apart as the poles from
7178,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ in taste, tone, narrative art, descriptions"
7179,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of religious rites, customs, usages, and treatment of the heroic"
7180,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"characters. This was plain to Greek commentators, and is even more"
7181,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,obvious to modern criticism.
7182,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7183,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"The questions, therefore, arise, were these Cyclic epics older in"
7184,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,_matter_ (as representing a more archaic tradition) than our Homer;
7185,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"are they older, or more recent, in _composition_, or are they and our"
7186,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Homer coeval? Mr. Monro expresses decisively the general opinion on
7187,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"these points. The Cyclic poems are by ""the poets who carried on the"
7188,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"traditions of Homeric art in the eighth and seventh centuries B.C.""[3]"
7189,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"He collects from them many incidents, beliefs, usages, and proofs of"
7190,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"geographical knowledge ""of a post-Homeric type.""[4] Of these, from one"
7191,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"poem, the _Cypria_, he selects five sets of examples. These represent"
7192,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,(i) human sacrifice; (2) geographical knowledge much beyond that
7193,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"exhibited in _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_; (3) interest in magic, which is"
7194,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"un-Homeric; (4) the introduction of a non-Homeric hero, Palamedes, of"
7195,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the first rank, of essential importance, and the ""Cause of Wrath"" of"
7196,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Zeus against the Achaeans; (5) hero-worship; (6) I add, introduction"
7197,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of a goddess unknown to Homer, but ""a concrete figure of ancient"
7198,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Attic religion;""[5] (7) introduction of the puerile fairy element in"
7199,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Märchen_ or folk-tales. Of this trait, and of magical incidents, there"
7200,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"are several examples. (8) loves of gods and goddesses, who take the"
7201,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,forms of various animals. From other Cyclic poems he selects other
7202,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"instances of these non-Homeric types, and also un-Homeric apparitions"
7203,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,of men who have been duly burned and buried; and cases of the
7204,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"purification of homicides by blood of pigs, wholly unknown to Homer."
7205,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7206,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"All these traits of the Cyclic poems, with others, such as the"
7207,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"invention of pseudo-historic genealogies, as of Thersites, are"
7208,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"non-Homeric. Some, such as the genealogy of Thersites, due to the"
7209,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_manie cyclique_, with the extended geographical outlook, are"
7210,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_post_-Homeric. But the others, the religious and magical notions--"
7211,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"hero-worship, the ghost belief, blood-purification,--though later in"
7212,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"record than our Homer (we assume), are even earlier in development, and"
7213,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"are beliefs and rites of the pre-Homeric population. (See ""Who were the"
7214,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Ionians?"" and Appendix, On ""Expurgation."")"
7215,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7216,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Now much confusion is caused by the term ""old."" The poems earlier _in"
7217,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,composition_ may represent Achaean ideas then new to Greece; the poems
7218,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"later in composition may, and do, contain ideas old in Greece, but"
7219,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"alien to Homer's Achaeans. Meanwhile, Mr. Monro, as we saw, regards"
7220,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,the actual Cyclic poems as works of poets of the eighth to seventh
7221,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"centuries B.C., who carried ""on the traditions of Homeric art"" in"
7222,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Ionia. This means that they take up Achaean themes and traditions and
7223,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"heroic characters, and use them in new poems ""composed with direct"
7224,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"reference to the _Iliad_.""[6] They lead up to the _Iliad_ by a long"
7225,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"chronicle of previous events in the _Cypria_, and continue the Homeric"
7226,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,narrative in their other epics. But they interlard the narrative with
7227,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"their own rites, beliefs, their own Attic goddess (Nemesis of Rhamnus),"
7228,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"and their own non-Achaean heroes, such as the Attic sons of Theseus,"
7229,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"and the great Nauplian, Palamedes. They also add silly elements of"
7230,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Märchen_, and pseudo-historic genealogies. They carve and cook the"
7231,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"great Achaean joint, and serve up with Attic and Ionian sauce and"
7232,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,trimmings.
7233,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7234,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"This is natural, for the Attic people, of the pre-Achaean population,"
7235,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"had not, as far as I know, any epic tradition of their own. They knew"
7236,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,that they were not engaged in any one of the alleged great collective
7237,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,efforts and expeditions with which the Achaeans credited themselves.
7238,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Some legends were dynastic adaptations of _Märchen_, with kings and"
7239,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,princesses changed into birds; or accounts of their relations with
7240,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Thrace, or explanations of the origin of the Eleusinian mysteries."
7241,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"They had, too, the story of Theseus and the Minotaur, an adventure of"
7242,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,an individual hero of _Märchen_; but that ran contrary to all Achaean
7243,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"and Cretan traditions, as we have seen. The Cyclic poets were mere"
7244,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"imitators of the Achaean epic: _epic_ tradition of their own, the"
7245,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,people of Attica and their Ionian colonists (confessedly mixed with a
7246,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,mongrel multitude) had none.
7247,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7248,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Mr. Leaf takes the same view. He speaks of the Cyclic epics as ""the"
7249,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"imitative poems which dealt with the old Tale of Troy, and essayed to"
7250,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"complete Homer.""[7]"
7251,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7252,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,But a contradictory opinion seems to be held by von
7253,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, and, as I understand, by Mr. Murray. The"
7254,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,celebrated German scholar argued thus: Before criticism arose in
7255,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Greece, almost all ancient Epic poetry, and the Hymns, were attributed"
7256,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"to ""Homer."" As early as Herodotus, however, we find that historian"
7257,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,regarding the _Cypria_ (a chronicle of the whole events before the
7258,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,opening of the _Iliad_) as not by the author of the _Iliad_.
7259,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7260,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"As time went on, and criticism advanced, the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_"
7261,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"alone were assigned to Homer, while the Cyclic poems were attributed"
7262,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"to various authors, such as Arctinus, Stasinus, and Lesches. The"
7263,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"attributions are late, various, perhaps never ""evidential""; but"
7264,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,criticism came to recognise our _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ as alone Homeric.
7265,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"The other epics, the Cyclics, were thought to be of a later age, and by"
7266,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,inferior hands.
7267,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7268,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,This view was evolved by Greek critics from Herodotus to Aristotle and
7269,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Aristarchus.
7270,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7271,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"On the other hand, according to Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Homer and"
7272,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the Cyclic poems were all qualitatively equivalent, and more or less"
7273,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"contemporaneous. A statement of this hypothesis, which deliberately"
7274,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"rejects the views of Greek criticism, shall be quoted from von"
7275,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Wilamowitz-Moellendorff.[8]
7276,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7277,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"""The epos"" (the whole mass of early epic poetry) ""is by Homer,"" so"
7278,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"says tradition. ""The criticism of the subsequent centuries broke off"
7279,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,from the mass of epos one portion after another: one after another
7280,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"must go, because it is inconsistent with the conception which has been"
7281,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,framed of Homer. At last the _Iliad_ alone abides. The only step that
7282,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,remained to be taken was to reject (_athetiren_) the _Iliad_ also: this
7283,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"step the ancients refused to take, for fear of falling into the abyss."
7284,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"But the step has been taken long ago. The _Iliad_, as it stands, is"
7285,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"not the work of one man, or of one century: it is not _one_ work at"
7286,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,all. The _Iliad_ is nothing but a [Greek: _kuklikon poieima_]. But we
7287,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"are in no abyss, no bottomless pit. On the other hand, we regain firm"
7288,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"ground, which ancient criticism had in childish rashness abandoned. The"
7289,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,_Iliad_ is just as much and as little Homeric as the _Cypria_. There
7290,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,is no qualitative difference between [Greek: _homeirikon_] and [Greek:
7291,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_kuklikon_]."""
7292,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7293,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Now that careless child, Aristotle, was of a different opinion. He"
7294,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,saw that the _Iliad_ varies absolutely in nature from some of the
7295,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Cyclics, and the fact is conspicuous. The _Iliad_ also varies, as the"
7296,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"scholiasts observed, from the Cyclics historically; varies in manners,"
7297,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"rites, religion, taste, and geographical knowledge. All these facts are"
7298,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"absolutely demonstrable. So great a critic as Aristotle, and, we may"
7299,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"add, so unprejudiced a critic, for he lived long before Wolf, could"
7300,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"not but remark the essential differences between the _Iliad_, on the"
7301,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"one hand, and some of the Ionian Cyclic poems on the other, as far as"
7302,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,_quality_ is concerned. Into the differences which archaeology and
7303,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"anthropology detect, Aristotle did not enter, for he was writing on"
7304,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the Art of Poetry. Unity in a poem, he said, is not obtained merely by"
7305,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,the selection of a single hero (the _Cypria_ is so far like _Vanity
7306,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Fair_ that it is a chronicle ""without a hero,"" unless the hero be Paris"
7307,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"or Palamedes). _Unity of action_ is, says Aristotle, essential to an"
7308,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Epic, and Homer observes this unity, grouping all the events round one"
7309,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_motif_, the Wrath of Achilles, or the Return of Odysseus. The _Cypria_"
7310,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,has no such unity; it simply ends where the _Iliad_ begins.
7311,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7312,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Unity, concentration, ""with beginning, middle, and end,"" is as"
7313,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"necessary, Aristotle holds, to epic as to dramatic poetry. The Trojan"
7314,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"war, to be sure, has a beginning, a middle, and an end, but the whole"
7315,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,could not be treated in an Epic under poetic conditions of space. One
7316,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_motif_ is therefore selected by Homer, with diversifying episodes."
7317,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,The author of the _Cypria_ did not adopt the true method of epic: in
7318,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ are subjects but for one or two tragedies;
7319,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"whereas the _Cypria_, extending over many years and dealing with many"
7320,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"regions, yields subjects for many, and the _Little Iliad_ for eight or"
7321,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"more plays, which are enumerated.[9]"
7322,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7323,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,We would not now state the case precisely in the terms of Aristotle:
7324,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,and the Attic tragedians possibly chose so many topics from the
7325,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Cyclics, so few from the _Iliad_, partly because the Athenians, as"
7326,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"chiefs of the Ionian name, preferred Ionian versions of the legends;"
7327,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"while, as Republicans, they used the Ionian term for Agamemnon and"
7328,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Menelaus as ""tyrants""; and kept up the singular Ionian feud against"
7329,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Odysseus, preferring to him Aias, a neighbour of Athens; Philoctetes,"
7330,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"oppressed by the ""tyrants""; and Palamedes, the victim of the tyrants"
7331,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,and of their minion Odysseus.
7332,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7333,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Such were the tastes of the Athenians; but we see that Aristotle
7334,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,observes the essential difference in poetic _quality_ between the
7335,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Iliad_ and _Odyssey_, which are Epics, while some of the Cyclic poems"
7336,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,are mere metrical chronicles.
7337,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7338,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"The difference between epic and versified chronicle is, I think,"
7339,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,that which divides Barbour's _The Brus_ and the _Wallace_ of Blind
7340,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Harry (poetical chronicles like the _Heracleis_, the late poem on the"
7341,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"history of Heracles), from epics like the _Chanson de Roland_ with"
7342,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"its one motive, ""The Wrath of Ganelon,"" its origins and consequences."
7343,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Our _Iliad_, in Aristotle's opinion, then, is an epic; the _Cypria_,"
7344,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the _Heracleis_, and so on, are _not_ epics, but rather are versified"
7345,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"chronicles. In Mr. Murray's opinion, too, the _Iliad_ is an epic, the"
7346,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Cypria_ is ""an old chronicle poem."" But this only proves, to his mind,"
7347,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"that the _Iliad_ is the further developed.[10] ""They grew together"
7348,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"side by side"" or centuries; but the _Iliad_, as we have it, is, he"
7349,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"thinks, of later and more accomplished art. Mr. Murray writes: ""In its"
7350,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"actual working up, however, our _Iliad_ has reached a further stage of"
7351,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"development than the ordinary run of poetic chronicles, if I may use"
7352,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the term.""[11]"
7353,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7354,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Now, as far as analogy serves our turn, the ""poetic chronicle"" is in a"
7355,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_later_ stage of development than the epic. Thus Barbour's _The Brus_,"
7356,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"or the Argonautic poem of the very late Apollonius, is in a much later"
7357,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"stage of development than the old Germanic epics, or _Beowulf_, which"
7358,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"selects two main events from the career of the hero. Again, versified"
7359,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"chronicles in France are much later in development than the epic, the"
7360,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Chanson de Roland_, ""The Wrath of Ganelon."""
7361,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7362,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"However, as analogies are never satisfactory, let us be content to note"
7363,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"that the _Iliad_ confessedly differs in character from the _Cypria_, as"
7364,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,the epic differs from the verse-chronicle. On this point von Wilamowitz
7365,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Moellendorff appears to agree, as does Mr. Murray, who studies the"
7366,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"subject in the spirit of the learned German. To repeat his statement,"
7367,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"he writes, ""These various books or masses of tradition in verse form"
7368,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"were growing up side by side for centuries.""[12]"
7369,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7370,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Now, ""masses of tradition"" certainly grew up through many centuries,"
7371,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"before and after Homer's time; but the _Iliad_ is not merely ""a mass"
7372,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of tradition."" It is a splendid work of art, fashioned, in our view,"
7373,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"by a great poet, out of masses of tradition, while what we know of"
7374,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the _Cypria_ is a compilation, partly from hints in the _Iliad_ and"
7375,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Odyssey_, with popular tales or _Märchen_ thrown in; and is animated"
7376,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"by a distinct _tendenz_, a partisan desire to debase the favourite"
7377,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"heroes of Homer, and to exalt a hero, Palamedes, who, to myself, seems"
7378,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"intended to represent the Ionian share in the Trojan war, neglected as"
7379,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,it is by Homer. To justify these criticisms as most probable on the
7380,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"evidence, it is necessary to offer an analysis of the _Cypria_, as far"
7381,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,as its contents are known to us from fragments and epitomes.
7382,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7383,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,The _Cypria_ opened thus: Zeus takes counsel on the problem of
7384,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"over-population. He ""resolves to relieve of her burden Earth that"
7385,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"nourishes all, by raising the great strife of the Ilian war, that death"
7386,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"may lighten the weight: the heroes were slain in Troyland, _but the"
7387,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Will of Zeus was accomplished._""[13]"
7388,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7389,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,The following account of the early part of the _Cypria_ is given by
7390,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the Scholiast in the famous ""Venice A"" manuscript of the _Iliad_. He"
7391,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,enters here into more details than Proclus in his epitome of the work.
7392,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"""They say that Earth, burdened by the abundance of men, all impious as"
7393,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"they were, prayed to Zeus to be relieved. Zeus then caused the Theban"
7394,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"war, whereby he destroyed many. Later again he called Momus (Mockery)"
7395,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"into council, 'the counsel of Zeus,' Homer styles it, though he might"
7396,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,have destroyed the human race altogether by deluges and thunderbolts.
7397,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"But Momus prevented this, and suggested to Zeus the marriage of Thetis"
7398,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"with a mortal, and the begetting of a beautiful daughter from these two"
7399,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"causes arose war involving both Hellenes and barbarians, from which"
7400,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"time Earth was lightened of her burden, so many men were slain. The"
7401,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"narrative is by Stasinus, the author of the _Cypria_...""[14]"
7402,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7403,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,In this version Themis is not mentioned as the adviser of Zeus; perhaps
7404,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"she suggested the Theban, and Momus the Trojan war."
7405,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7406,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"In the epitome of Proclus, Eris (Strife) comes among the Gods at the"
7407,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,bridal feast of Peleus and Thetis. Of this feast one detail remains
7408,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"in a fragment of the _Cypria,_ which the Scholiast gives in prose."
7409,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Cheiron the Centaur cut an ash-tree for a spear, as a wedding present"
7410,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"to Peleus. Athene polished it, and Hephaestus forged the point. This"
7411,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"spear, which Achilles alone could wield, is mentioned as the gift of"
7412,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Cheiron to Achilles in the _Iliad_ (xvi. 143, 144, and xix. 389-90)."
7413,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"If, then, we find in the _Cypria_ decisive proof that there it is later"
7414,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"than the _Iliad_, we may suppose the author to borrow here from our"
7415,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Homer, and to add the previous division of labour in the spear-making."
7416,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,As a bronze-smith Hephaestus only makes the metal point of the weapon.
7417,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"At the bridal feast, Eris rouses a dispute between Aphrodite, Athene,"
7418,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,and Hera as to superiority in beauty.
7419,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7420,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,To return to the Epitome of Proclus. The three contending goddesses
7421,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"are led by Hermes to Mount Ida, and Paris pronounces Aphrodite to be"
7422,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,the most beautiful; he has been won by her promise of Helen as his
7423,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"wife. This is suggested by _Iliad_, xxiv. 29, 30, where the passage,"
7424,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"according to some, suggests that all three goddesses _wooed_ Paris, and"
7425,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,that he preferred Aphrodite. But this is wholly out of keeping with the
7426,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Greek conception of Hera and Athene; and the lines in _Iliad_, xxiv.,"
7427,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,must refer to the cause of the ferocity with which these two slighted
7428,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"goddesses persecute Troy, though Athene was its patron. No other cause"
7429,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,has been adduced.
7430,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7431,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,The counsel of Zeus could not have caused the Trojan war merely by
7432,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"making the goddesses quarrel. It was necessary to beget ""the beautiful"
7433,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"daughter,"" whom Aphrodite was to offer as a bride to Paris. According"
7434,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"to the Cypria, this fairest of women, Helen, wife of Menelaus, was"
7435,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"not the daughter of Zeus and Leda, but of Zeus and Nemesis; in Homer,"
7436,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Nemesis is little more than the emotion of virtuous indignation, she"
7437,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"is not, as in the Cypria, a chaste and pretty nymph, ""fair-tressed"
7438,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Nemesis."" Her does Zeus pursue and, says the inept author of the"
7439,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Cypria, ""the feelings of Nemesis were torn by shame and nemesis"""
7440,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,(indignation). Mr. Murray devotes eight pages to the ethical meaning
7441,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,of [Greek: Aidoos] (shame) and of [Greek: Nemesis] (righteous
7442,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,indignation).[15] Surely we must recognise a great difference in manner
7443,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"between Homer, to whom nemesis means ""righteous indignation,"" and the"
7444,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"author of the _Cypria_, to whom Nemesis is a fair-tressed nymph? Homer,"
7445,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"it is true, knows _themis_ as customary law, and _Themis_, a goddess."
7446,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,But _she_ is not a fair-tressed being who flees from her lover in a
7447,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,series of animal disguises.
7448,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7449,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Later Greeks, puzzled by the contending versions of our Homer and"
7450,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of the _Cypria_, declared that Nemesis was, indeed, the mother of"
7451,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Helen, but that Leda, wife of Tyndareus, was her foster-mother and"
7452,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"brought her up.[16] Meanwhile Nemesis, in the _Cypria_, is not a mere"
7453,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"personification of the sentiment of nemesis, or righteous indignation,"
7454,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"but is, as we know, ""a concrete figure of ancient Attic tradition,"" ""a"
7455,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"primitive goddess of Rhamnus,"" in Attica, associated with, or a local"
7456,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"form of, ""the wild Artemis"" of pre-Achaean religion, ""with deep roots"
7457,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"in local worship."" Nemesis had a famous statue at Rhamnus, attributed"
7458,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"by Pausanias to Pheidias; a fragment of the face, in the British"
7459,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Museum, proves that it was at least of the school of Pheidias. She"
7460,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"held in her hand a spray of the apple-tree, an attribute of Aphrodite,"
7461,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"and the stag of Artemis was an ornament of her crown. She was also ""a"
7462,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"queen over death and the dead,"" a chthonic characteristic.[17] The"
7463,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Nemesis of Rhamnus was thus like the very primitive Artemis of Brauron
7464,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"in Attica. At Smyrna, where the population was very mixed, Pausanias"
7465,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,mentions two Nemeses.[18]
7466,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7467,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"We see that all this of Nemesis, in the _Cypria_, is at once apart as"
7468,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the poles from the Nemesis of Homer, virtuous indignation personified,"
7469,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,and is also an Ionian celebration of an Attic goddess of the
7470,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,pre-Achaean faith.
7471,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7472,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"In the _Cypria_, Aphrodite, mother of Aeneas (in Homer), sends him with"
7473,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Paris. Landing in Lacedaemon, Paris is welcomed by the brothers of"
7474,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Helen, and in Sparta by Menelaus, who then sails to Crete. (Different"
7475,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,reasons for this voyage are given by later writers.) Paris then seduces
7476,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Helen, _who is brought to him by Aphrodite_ (as in _Iliad_, iii.);"
7477,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_they take away property of Menelaus_ (as in _Iliad_, vii.). (The"

7479,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7480,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"The pair are wedded in Troy, where the story leaves them, and very"
7481,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"needlessly goes back to Lacedaemon. Here are Helen's brothers, Castor"
7482,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"and Polydeuces, who fall into a feud about cattle with Idas and"
7483,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Lynceus, the keen-eyed. Lynceus is merely the Keen-Eye, who can see"
7484,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"through everything, a common personage in _Märchen._ The brothers of"
7485,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Helen hide themselves in a hollow tree, but Lynceus climbs to the"
7486,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"crest of Mount Taygetus and ""looks over all the isle of Pelops,"" that"
7487,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"is, Peloponnesus. Homer never speaks of the country as a geographical"
7488,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"unity, nor uses the word ""Peloponnesus""; this is manifestly a"
7489,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,post-Homeric term.[19] Idas slays Castor; Polydeuces slays both
7490,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Lynceus and Idas, and Zeus assigns to Castor and Polydeuces immortality"
7491,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"on alternate days. This is wholly unknown to the _Iliad_, both heroes"
7492,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"are dead and buried in _Iliad_, iii. 243, 244. Their alternate"
7493,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"immortality with their divine honours, mentioned in _Odyssey_, xi."
7494,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"298-304, may be an interpolation (a kind of footnote in verse); it"
7495,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"is, at all events, non-Iliadic. Homer knows the deaths of the two"
7496,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"brothers, at home in Lacedaemon: we cannot tell whether he knew about"
7497,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the Keen-Eye of _Märchen_, Lynceus."
7498,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7499,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"In the _Cypria_, Menelaus is now informed, in Crete, about the flight"
7500,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,of Helen: he returns to the isle of Pelops and consults Agamemnon about
7501,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"collecting an army. Nestor, called to council, abounds in anecdotic"
7502,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,digressions (whether the author borrows this trait from the _Iliad_
7503,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"or the _Iliad_ from him, it is not hard to guess!). Among Nestor's"
7504,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,themes--for he simply poured out stories--are Epopeus and his seduction
7505,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,of the daughter of Lycus; Oedipous; the madness of Heracles; and the
7506,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"tale of Theseus (whom Homer steadily avoids), and Ariadne. Theseus, as"
7507,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"an Athenian, is dear to the Ionian poet: Homer ignores him."
7508,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7509,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,The Atridae go through Greece collecting the heroes. Odysseus feigns

7512,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"way of the plough. Here we have a hero, Palamedes, unknown to Homer,"
7513,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"and an equally unknown Odysseus who is a coward, but is baffled by"

7525,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"turned the serpent into a stone. Calchas prophesied, ""we shall fight"

7531,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"to fill up the nine years before the _Iliad_ opens in some way, and"
7532,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,this is how he did it. (Italics mark possible hints from Homer.)
7533,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Learning from the Odyssey_ (xi. 519-521) _that Eurypylus, a Mysian"
7534,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"chief, son of Telephus, came to the aid of Troy after the death of"
7535,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Achilles_, he makes the Achaeans land in Teuthrania, and supposing the"
7536,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"town to be Troy, they attack it. But Telephus comes to the rescue, and"
7537,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"is wounded by Achilles. A storm falls on the fleet, and the ships are"
7538,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,scattered. _Achilles arrives in Scyros and weds Deidameia_. The storm
7539,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,that sends Achilles to marry and beget a son in Scyros was an easy
7540,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"explanation of _Achilles' own statement_,[21] that he had a son at"
7541,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Scyros.[22]
7542,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7543,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"In the _Cypria_, Achilles later returns from Scyros to Argos,"

7551,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"The author of the _Cypria_, who is filling up his nine imaginary years"

7553,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,mustering the scattered fleet at Aulis _for the second time_. This
7554,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,enables him to please an Ionian audience by introducing their favourite
7555,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"incident, the sacrifice of a princess: Attic traditions harp eternally"
7556,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"on this un-Homeric horror. Agamemnon shoots a stag, and boasts"
7557,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,himself a better shot than Artemis. The angry goddess sends a tempest
7558,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"unceasing, the ships cannot sail, and Calchas (who dared not do such a"

7560,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"sacrificed, Iphigeneia. This name was, at least in later days, a name"
7561,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of the homicidal Artemis of Tauris, on the north shore of the Euxine."
7562,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"But Tauris, as Mr. Monro justly observes, was not known to Homer. In"
7563,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the _Cypria_, Artemis substitutes a fawn for Iphigeneia, and carries"

7565,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"story,"" the form in the _Cypria_, ""is necessarily later than the Greek"
7566,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"settlements on the northern coasts of the Euxine.""[23] The connection"
7567,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"between Iphigeneia and a Tauric Artemis is thus late, un-Homeric, and"
7568,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Ionian. Homer (_Iliad_, ix. 145) knows no Iphigeneia, but the daughters"
7569,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of Agamemnon are Chrysothemis, Laodice, and Iphianassa. Even so early"
7570,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,a poet as Stesichorus could not account for Iphigeneia as a daughter
7571,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of Agamemnon. He therefore, says Pausanias, made her a foster-child"
7572,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of Clytaemnestra, a child of Helen by Theseus (who, in Attic myth,"
7573,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"captured her), and Helen hands her baby over to the wife of Agamemnon."
7574,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Euphorion of Chalcis, Alexander of Pleuron, and the people of Argos"
7575,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"generally, maintained this theory, and at Argos they showed a temple"
7576,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of Ilithyia, founded by Helen after her safe delivery![24] Tzetzes,"
7577,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the father of nonsense, makes Iphigeneia the daughter of Agamemnon and"
7578,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Chryseis; she is sacrificed, or threatened with sacrifice, during the"
7579,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,return from Troy.
7580,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7581,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"However, the Ionian author of the _Cypria_ cannot deny himself an"
7582,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"allusion to human sacrifice. Iphigeneia was brought to Aulis, he says,"
7583,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"under the pretence that she was to wed Achilles. (See Euripides,"
7584,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,_Iphigeneia in Aulis_. He may be following the _Cypria_.) She was

7594,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,next tells of the embassy to ask for the return of Helen and the stolen

7603,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7604,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,The _Cypria_ says that Aphrodite contrived an interview between Helen
7605,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"and Achilles, Thetis was chaperon, and that Achilles restrained the"
7606,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Greeks, who wished to go home. _That Achilles sacked Lyrnessus and"

7609,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Chryseis, given in the _Cypria_, was to be found. But not in the"

7611,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"in the _Cypria_, came the will of Zeus to sunder Achilles from the"

7614,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,We now perceive how much of his material the Ionian author of
7615,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,the _Cypria_ could obtain from out Homer. We note the marks of
7616,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"non-Achaeanism and lateness, and of Ionian geographical knowledge, in"
7617,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,the reference to Tauris; in the Attic Nemesis; in the per-sonifications
7618,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,of moral qualities; in the intended human sacrifice; in the _Märchen_;
7619,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,in the telling of the tale of Theseus and Ariadne; in the hero-worship;
7620,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,and in the introduction of the Nauplian anti--Odyssean Palamedes.
7621,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,The lateness of the poem declares itself also in the naming of the
7622,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Peloponnesus. The use of very childish _Märchen_ is un-Homeric: Homer
7623,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"uses _Märchen_ to better purpose. (See ""Homer and the Saga."")"

7628,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"analysis of the vast and wandering metrical pseudo-chronicle, the"
7629,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Cypria_, with its marks of bad taste, Ionicism, and lateness, will"
7630,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"maintain that, in character, it is on a level with our Homer, or is in"
7631,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,age contemporary with his society.
7632,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7633,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Weary as is the task, we must in conscience expose the similar lateness"
7634,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,and Ionic character of the other Cyclic poems on the Trojan affairs.
7635,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7636,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,The authorship of the _Aethiopis_ was attributed to Arctinus of
7637,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Miletus. Tradition called him ""Homer's pupil.""[27] As condensed in the"
7638,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"summary of Proclus, the _Aethiopis_ was a mere _doppelgänger_ of the"
7639,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Iliad_. Taking up the tale after Hector's death, and under the shadow"
7640,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of Hector's prophecy of the doom of Achilles, ""in the day when Paris"
7641,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"and Phoebus Apollo slay thee in the Scaean gate,""[28] the _Aethiopis_"
7642,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,fills out the story.
7643,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7644,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"The Amazon, Penthesilea, comes to aid Troy, and is slain by Achilles,"
7645,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,who is stirred by pity for the beauty of his victim. For this Thersites
7646,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"taunts him, and he slays the wretch: so he needs purification, _in"
7647,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,accordance with Ionian ideas_.
7648,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7649,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,The _Aethiopis_ went on to mark the usual distinction between the
7650,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Homeric and Ionian epic. Diomede took up the blood-feud for Thersites,"
7651,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"and, in Homeric law, Achilles must have paid the blood-wyte, or gone"
7652,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"into exile, or ""tholed the feud."" Even the Scholiast[29] knew that this"
7653,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,was the Homeric (as it was the Icelandic) law. But the Ionian makes
7654,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Achilles sail to Lesbos, to sacrifice to Apollo, Artemis, and Leto, and"
7655,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,be purified (in pig's blood probably) by Odysseus.
7656,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7657,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Thus the Ionian makes us certain that he was of an un-Homeric state
7658,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of society. He dates himself in similar fashion, when he makes Memnon"
7659,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"(who, as in the _Odyssey_, slays Antilochus) receive after death"
7660,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,the gift of immortality; and when he makes Thetis carry the body of
7661,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Achilles (burned in the _Odyssey_) to be the worshipped hero of the
7662,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"isle of Leuke in the Euxine. There, when Ionian colonists reached the"
7663,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Euxine, Achilles became a ruling religious hero, recognised by Alcaeus"
7664,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"(Fr. 49). ""The Locrians in Italy,"" according to Pausanias, had a cult"
7665,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of Aias, whose armed ghost wounded Leonymus of Croton in battle. (In"
7666,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"post-Homeric Greece the ghosts of heroes appeared in mortal wars, as"
7667,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,St. James fought for Cortes against the Aztecs. Homer could conceive
7668,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"no such folly.) The Delphic oracle dispatched Leonymus to Leuke, where"
7669,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"he found Achilles happily married to Helen, who sent by Leonymus a"
7670,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"message to the poet Stesichorus, that had libelled her. Patroclus and"
7671,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Antilochus were with Achilles in Leukê, etc. etc.[30]"
7672,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7673,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"If the _Aethiopis_ is earlier than these Ionian colonies, if Leuke in"
7674,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"fable meant ""the isle of light,"" then the colonists identified the"
7675,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Euxine isle with the isle of light, and so worshipped the dead Achilles"
7676,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of Leuke. The Ionian trading cities, of which Miletus was chief, had"
7677,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"begun to adopt the new religious ideas that grew up, after the Homeric"
7678,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"age, in honour of the national heroes.[31] It is more probable that"
7679,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,the Ionians had never dropped the rites and religions of the conquered
7680,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"races, and merely added Achilles to Erechtheus. They had no spite"
7681,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"against Achilles, who had never, like Agamemnon and Diomede, been their"
7682,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,master.
7683,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7684,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"For the rest, the story of the _Aethiopis_ is conducted on the lines of"
7685,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the _Iliad_, as far as the events included in the poems, ending with"
7686,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the death of Achilles in the Scaean gate, permit imitation; and all"
7687,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"concludes with a lament or _regret_, a funeral, and funeral games, as"
7688,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,in the _Iliad_.
7689,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7690,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"The _Little Iliad_ contains several main incidents, of which seven"
7691,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"were, or may have been, expansions of hints in the _Odyssey_ and"
7692,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Iliad_. The additions are the theft of the Palladium, a kind of fetich"
7693,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,ignored by Homer; the magical power of the arrows of Philoctetes over
7694,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the fate of Troy; the introduction of Sinon, as followed by Virgil in"
7695,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the _Aeneid_; and a long story about Aethra, mother of Theseus and"
7696,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"slave of Helen in Troy, and about her grandsons, sons of Theseus, whose"
7697,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"presence in the Achaean host is unknown to Homer. In _Iliad_, iii. 144,"
7698,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Helen has, in an interpolated line, an attendant, ""Aethra, daughter of"
7699,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Pittheus."" This was enough for the Ionian poets; for, as Aethra was"
7700,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the name of the mother of Theseus, ""naturally the later poets took"
7701,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,advantage of it in order to find a place for the Attic heroes in the
7702,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"main body of epic narrative.""[32]"
7703,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7704,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Mr. Leaf makes _Iliad_, iii. 144, ""a clear case of an interpolation of"
7705,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"a later myth,"" a myth introduced here to please the Athenians. Aethra"
7706,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"and the rape of Helen by Theseus, to avenge which the brothers of Helen"
7707,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"carried the mother of Theseus away, were depicted and described on"
7708,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the chest of Cypselus,[33] and painted by Polygnotus, following the"
7709,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Little Iliad_ of Lesches, on the _Leschê_ at Delphi. But here Aethra"
7710,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"was with the Homeric maids of Helen (Panthalis and Electra), but was"
7711,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"being recognised by her un-Homeric grandson, son of Theseus, Demophon."
7712,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"According to the _Little Iliad_, Aethra escaped to the Greek camp: by"
7713,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"permission of Helen, Agamemnon restores Aethra to her grandsons.[34]"
7714,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7715,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Ionia could only drag fair Helen into the Athenian legend of Theseus
7716,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"by averring that he carried her off when she was a child, and that she"
7717,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"was brought back to the house of Tyndareus her sire by her brothers,"
7718,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Castor and Polydeuces. They also seized Aethra, the mother of Theseus,"
7719,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"who accompanied Paris and Helen to Troy, and was still in Helen's"
7720,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,service after the ten years of the leaguer. Now as Theseus in his prime
7721,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"was contemporary with the youth of Nestor, and as Nestor was, say,"
7722,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"seventy in the tenth year of the war, the mother of Theseus must have"
7723,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"been more than a centenarian when she was the _suivante_ of Helen, in"
7724,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Iliad_, Book iii. But Ionians stuck at nothing in the effort to bring"
7725,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"themselves into touch with the great Achaean enterprise; that is, stuck"
7726,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,at nothing except at interpolating their fables into the _Iliad_. They
7727,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"could perhaps insert, as in _Iliad_, iii. 144, a mention or two of"
7728,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Theseus, and some lines on Attic heroines in _Odyssey_, xi."
7729,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7730,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,There can be no more conclusive proof that Ionians did not possess the
7731,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,power of adding what they pleased to the Achaean epics.
7732,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7733,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"The _Ilion Persis_, or _Sack of Troy_, was a poem attributed, like"
7734,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the _Aethiopis_, to Arctinus of Miletus. Herein occurs the affair of"
7735,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the Wooden Horse, familiar to readers of the _Odyssey_ in the lay of"
7736,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Demodocus at the board of Alcinous.[35] Demodocus tells enough to serve
7737,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Arctinus with a theme which only needs expansion. The story was given
7738,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,much as Virgil and Quintus Smyrnaeus render it; we have the portent
7739,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of Laocoon and the serpents, which causes Aeneas and his men (not as"
7740,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"in Virgil) to retire to Mount Ida. In the song of Demodocus, Odysseus"
7741,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"gets most of the credit of success; the hero in _Odyssey_, xi. 504-537,"
7742,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"gives the glory to Neoptolemus--and himself. In Arctinus, Odysseus"
7743,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"murders the child of Hector, Astyanax (an un-Homeric cruelty); Odysseus"
7744,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,is always degraded by the Ionians and usually by the Attic tragedians.
7745,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Aias Oileus's son enrages Athene by dragging down her image while
7746,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,struggling with Cassandra; hence the sorrows of the Achaeans on their
7747,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"way home. The sons of Theseus carry to Athens their aged grandmother,"
7748,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Aethra. Could anything be more characteristic of the Athenians than
7749,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the fact that the heroes looking out from the Horse, in a bronze group"
7750,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"on the Acropolis, were Attic, the two apocryphal sons of Theseus, the"
7751,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Athenian Menestheus, and Teucer, ""who expresses the Athenian claim to"
7752,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Salamis""?[36]"
7753,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7754,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"By a truly Ionian touch, Polyxena, daughter of Priam, is sacrificed at"
7755,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,the tomb of Achilles. It seems probable that the _Iliou Persis_ really
7756,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,took up the story with the suicide of Aias (from this part of the poem
7757,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"a fragment is quoted in the scholia to _Iliad_, xi. 515),[37] and that"
7758,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the poem contained the whole prowess of Neoptolemus at Troy, and the"
7759,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,affair of the bringing back of Philoctetes from Lemnos. The prominence
7760,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"of Aeneas expands the hint in _Iliad_, xx. 307, 308, the prophecy of"
7761,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Poseidon that he and his children will long rule over the Trojans.
7762,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Throughout the _Iliad_, Aeneas is protected by Aphrodite, and is looked"
7763,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"on jealously by Priam, as a Stewart might look on a Hamilton; for,"
7764,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"failing issue of Priam, Aeneas succeeds to the Trojan crown. The whole"
7765,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"poem, wherever Aeneas appears, is affected by the tradition that he did"
7766,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,continue the Trojan line.
7767,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7768,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,The sacrifice of Polyxena at the tomb of Achilles appears to be
7769,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,peculiar to Arctinus. It would be interesting to know whether or not
7770,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,any Ionian poem was the source of the story of Polyxena as given by
7771,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Dictys Cretensis. In Dictys, Patroclus moves Achilles to be reconciled"
7772,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"to Agamemnon: the army goes into winter quarters, and Trojans and"
7773,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Achaeans meet on friendly terms in the grove of Thymbraean Apollo;
7774,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Achilles sees Polyxena at a sacrifice, and falls in love with her."
7775,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Hector offers her as the price of his treason to the Achaeans, which"
7776,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,annoys Achilles. At Polyxena's request he later restores the body of
7777,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Hector to Priam. At a subsequent meeting in Apollo's temple, Paris"
7778,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"stabs Achilles to death. After the capture of Troy, Odysseus advises"
7779,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the sacrifice of Polyxena to the ghost of Achilles, but Euripides and"
7780,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,later writers make the ghost or voice of Achilles demand her death. In
7781,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"other respects, as to the fate of the Trojan ladies, Dictys follows"
7782,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Arctinus.
7783,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7784,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"All this tale deeply affected the mediaeval tale of Troy. Meanwhile,"
7785,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"we do not know _why_ in Arctinus, Polyxena was chosen as the [Greek:"
7786,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_geras_], or honourable gift, of the dead Achilles. The idea may only"
7787,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"have been that, while surviving leaders received each a damsel, the"
7788,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,spirit of the great chief should not be deprived of its reward. No idea
7789,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"can be less Achaean, less Homeric, but it is congenial to the Ionian"
7790,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,spirit.
7791,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7792,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"The fact of the sacrifice would easily suggest, to still later writers,"
7793,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"that in his life days Achilles loved Polyxena, and was loved by her;"
7794,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,for Philostratus and Tzetzes aver that heart-broken by the murder of
7795,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Achilles, she slew herself above his tomb."
7796,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7797,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Thus we see how, in the Ionian epics, and onwards through Stesichorus,"
7798,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the tragedians, the Roman poets, Dictys, and the mediaeval makers, the"
7799,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"poetic consciousness played freely round the Homeric data, colouring"
7800,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,them with the rainbow hues of changing beliefs and changing tastes.
7801,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"There is at least as wide a gulf between the tastes and ideas of Homer,"
7802,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"on one side, and of the Ionians on the other, as between Arctinus, on"
7803,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"one hand, and Benoit de Troyes and Boccaccio, on the other."
7804,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7805,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"That the Ionian ideas, tastes, rites, and legends, as of Theseus"
7806,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"and Palamedes, never were intruded into the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_,"
7807,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"considering that for so long Homer was ""taught, recited, imitated in"
7808,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Ionia,""[38] is an undeniable and amazing fact. How were Ionian hands"
7809,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"restrained from touching the substance of the Achaean epics? This is,"
7810,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"in the strict sense, a paradox, but the facts are undeniable: the"
7811,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,epics were never Ionised. Homer was falsely claimed by Athens as an
7812,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Ionian poet. Is there some basis of truth in the idea that the Aeolian
7813,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Homeridae of Chios guarded their own?[39]
7814,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7815,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"I have now given my view of the Cyclic poems as late, post-Homeric, and"
7816,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Ionian in (i) geographical knowledge; (2) in hero-worship; (3) in rites
7817,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,of human sacrifice and purification; (4) in the mania for inventing
7818,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"genealogies, as of Thersites, basest born of the host; (5) in partisan"
7819,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,attacks on great Achaeans; (6) in silly _Märchen_; (7) in efforts to
7820,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"introduce representatives of Athens, the grandsons of Theseus, into the"
7821,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"war; (8) the Attic goddess, Nemesis."
7822,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7823,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Of these eight proofs of lateness and Ionicism, Mr. Murray takes no"
7824,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"notice: on the whole, he thinks our Homer later than some state of the"
7825,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,lost Epics. He supposes parts of the _Iliad_ to be borrowed from these
7826,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Epics. ""We happen to know that there was an old chronicle poem which"
7827,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,both contained a catalogue of the ships and also narrated at length the
7828,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,assembling of the fleet at Aulis--the so-called _Cypria_ or Cyprian
7829,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"verses.""[40] This piece of information may be correct, I know not; but"
7830,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,no authority is cited for the statement that the _Cypria_ contained a
7831,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"catalogue of the ships, and no such authority is known to me.[41] Von"
7832,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Wilamowitz--Moellendorff _conjectures_ that the _Cypria_ contained a
7833,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"catalogue of the Achaeans, but that is not evidence."
7834,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7835,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"In support of his theory that our _Iliad_ is ""in a further state of"
7836,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"development"" than some poetic chronicles, Mr. Murray writes that"
7837,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"passages in the _Iliad_ ""seem to be derived from the _Cypria_, the"
7838,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Little Iliad_, and the _Sack of Ilion_, the so-called _Acthiopis_...."
7839,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"These, then, are all pieces of supposed history taken over from one"
7840,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"traditional poem into another.""[42]"
7841,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7842,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,This appears to mean that the poems named were complete before the
7843,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Iliad_ was complete, though all of them ""were growing side by side"
7844,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"for centuries."" Indeed, Mr. Murray might seem to change his ground in"
7845,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,a later statement of his opinions. In _The Rise of the Greek Epic_ we
7846,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,hear of borrowings by the _Iliad_ from several Cyclic poems made in
7847,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Asia, and from the ""Eumelian"" verses in Europe. (For ""Eumelus,"" see"
7848,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"""Homer and the Saga."") Of borrowings by the Cyclics and ""Eumelus"" from"
7849,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the _Iliad_ we do not hear. On the other hand, in _Anthropology and"
7850,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the Classics_ (lectures by various students), Mr. Murray writes, ""the"
7851,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"extant remains of the non-Homeric poems frequently show in their form,"
7852,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"and sometimes even in their content, definite signs of presupposing"
7853,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"the _Iliad_, just as the _Iliad_ here and there shows signs of"
7854,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"presupposing them....""[43] But, _R. G. E_. p. 160, meets the charge of"
7855,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,changed views.
7856,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7857,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"If the _Cypria_ be earlier than the _Iliad_, yet presupposes the"
7858,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Iliad_ (about Palamedes it does not), I presume it may also borrow"
7859,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"from the _Iliad_; whereas, previously, the _Iliad_ was mainly credited"
7860,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,with the borrowings from the Cyclics. Perhaps we are intended to
7861,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"understand that ""had we seen these poems before they were made,"" we"
7862,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,would find that they all borrowed from each other. My mind is not
7863,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"metaphysical enough to conceive what the poems were ""before they were"
7864,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"made."" To me it seems that they must, before they were made, have been"
7865,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"mere masses of materials, traditions, legends, lays of unknown extent,"
7866,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,and _Märchen_ that had no original connection with definite places
7867,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"and persons. There was no _Cypria_, no _Iliad_, no _Little Iliad_, no"
7868,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Aethiopis_ before these poems were made. We should not, I think, speak"
7869,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,of any unmade poem in the making as borrowing matter from another poem
7870,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"which, by our theory, is also still unmade."
7871,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7872,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"We can only speak of the poets as selecting, each for himself, from"
7873,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,the same mass of materials. If we conceive one poem to have been made
7874,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"before another, then the author or authors of that other may borrow"
7875,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"from the earlier work. Thus, when the _Cypria_ or other Cyclic poems"
7876,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"coincide in topic with the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_, that may be (1)"
7877,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,because the authors work out hints given in these finished poems; or
7878,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"(2) the authors may have had recourse to the same ""masses of tradition"""
7879,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,as were open to the author of the _Iliad_. But the Cyclic poets do not
7880,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"often appear to know Achaean traditions, of the Trojan affair outside"
7881,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,of our Homer. We have shown that Palamedes was not originally an
7882,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Achaean of the Achaeans, but a culture hero. The legend of Telephus,"
7883,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"with its sympathetic magic, is wholly un-Achaean; so is Iphigeneia; so"
7884,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,are the sons of Theseus; so is the Attic Nemesis.
7885,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7886,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"As we shall show in an Appendix, Mr. Murray accounts for the"
7887,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"non-Achaean elements so conspicuous in the Cyclic poems, by the theory"
7888,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"that they once also appeared in the lays whence our _Iliad_ arose,"
7889,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,but were expurgated by the clear Hellenic spirit of Greece in the
7890,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"sixth century, because these lays alone were recited at Panionian and"
7891,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Panathenaean festivals. Our own conclusion is that the Muses befriended
7892,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,Homer when they permitted the fragments of the Cyclic poems to escape
7893,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,the tooth of time. For these fragments suffice to prove that the Ionian
7894,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"poets could take up an Achaean theme, but in a score of ways, in their"
7895,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"epics, betrayed themselves as non-Achaean."
7896,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,
7897,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Their poems are not sections cut out of an Achaean mass of lays, and"
7898,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"our Homer is not a similar section, is not Cyclic. It has now been"
7899,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"proved, I think, that in no point or trait of life, religion, legends,"
7900,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"armour, tactics, rites, taste, poetic method, or anything else, is"
7901,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"Homer affected by Ionian influences. The _Iliad_, and mainly the"
7902,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"_Odyssey_, are entirely distinct in all their contents from Ionian"
7903,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"work. They are much older, and are the fruit of the brief-lived flower"

8016,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"to the whole Cycle, and was composed for that part of it which,"
8017,HOMER AND THE CYCLIC POEMS,"as worked up into a separate poem, was called the _Kypria_, and"

8042,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8043,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8044,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,The standing argument against the old belief in the unity of
8045,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"authorship of the Epics, has for several generations been based on the"
8046,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,discrepancies and inconsistencies which are said to abound in these
8047,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"poems. ""The only begetter"" of the critical school which lacerates"
8048,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Homer was Wolf; but Wolf's suspicions were not originally roused by
8049,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"inconsistencies which shocked him in the poems. The poems, he said,"
8050,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"had _unus color_, ""one harmonious colouring."" But if that be true, and"
8051,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"it is true, how was this harmony preserved in a poem which, as Wolf"
8052,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"decided from _a priori_ considerations, cannot be the work of one man"
8053,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,or one age? Now the work of many men in many ages inevitably _must_
8054,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"be a chaos, not a harmony, and so Wolf's followers have devoted their"
8055,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,lives to the hunt for discrepancies and inaccuracies fit to support
8056,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,their preconceived opinion.
8057,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8058,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Meanwhile Wolf started, not from discrepancies which could only exist"
8059,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"in a mosaic of the lays of several distinct ages, but from _a priori_"
8060,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,reflections on the nature of the age and civilisation in which the
8061,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,epics began. Of that age and civilisation we have now some knowledge.
8062,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Wolf had none. He reckoned that, granting the barbarism of the unknown"
8063,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"age as he conceived it, and the abysm of time through which the poems"
8064,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"passed before they reached the hands of competent grammarians,--the"
8065,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Alexandrians,--the texts of epics must necessarily have suffered"
8066,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"terribly. If so, there necessarily must be many fatal discrepancies,"
8067,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"--unless, indeed, the supposed Editorial Committee at Athens (600-530"
8068,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,B.C.) and the Alexandrian editors later harmonised the whole into the
8069,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"actual _unus color_. For the whole _did_ seem harmonious to Wolf,"
8070,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"with merely a few roughnesses, and passages suspected even by the"
8071,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"ancient grammarians. But Wolf's successors, hypnotised by his original"
8072,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"_suggestion_ that, in the circumstances of the case, the poems _must_"
8073,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"be by many hands, have felt that, if so, they _must_ contain many fatal"
8074,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"discrepancies, have hunted for, and have, of course, found them. Thus"
8075,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,an unscientific and illogical method has long prevailed.
8076,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8077,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Indeed, a method less scientific and less logical cannot be imagined."
8078,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Critics already prepossessed by the suggestion of Wolf in favour of
8079,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"multiplex authorship, sedulously hunt, we repeat, through the poems for"
8080,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,discrepancies in support of their case. They do what men have never
8081,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"done to any other long poetic work of imagination, they seek, with"
8082,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"microscopic minuteness of inquiry, for inconsistencies in a fictitious"
8083,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"narrative, composed not for analytic readers, but for a circle of"
8084,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,listeners. When they find--or much more frequently imagine that they
8085,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"have found--such discrepancies, they proclaim them as proofs of"
8086,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,multiplex authorship. Never have they as eagerly and carefully sought
8087,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,for such errors in long imaginative tales that are certainly known
8088,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,to be the work of one hand. Scientific method imperatively demands
8089,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,this investigation; but the critics do not listen. They have studied
8090,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,a work of pure literature with the desire to prove their own foregone
8091,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"conclusion, that the authorship of the _Iliad_ is multiplex, and that"
8092,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,it is the growth of several disparate ages.
8093,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8094,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,When archaeological discoveries during the last forty years had thrown
8095,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"some light on the pre-Homeric age, then the material objects found"
8096,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,were raked and sifted for proof of the foregone conclusion--the Epic
8097,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,is a mosaic of four or five centuries. We have examined the results
8098,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"of the archaeological inquisition into discrepancies in religion,"
8099,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"custom, armour, tactics, and so forth. We try to prove that, in all"
8100,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"such details, the epics are the work of a single moment of culture; and"
8101,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"again, that no other work of the Greek genius, and no material relics"
8102,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"of other moments of Greek culture, represent the religion, polity,"
8103,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"armour, costume, morality, and taste of Homer. Not in these fields of"
8104,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,ascertainable facts can the proof that the Epics are by many men in
8105,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,many ages be discovered.
8106,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8107,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Except in the general conclusion that the _Iliad_ is a mosaic, produced"
8108,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,(most of them think) by a long series of Ionian additions to an Achaean
8109,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""kernel,"" there is no harmony among critics. For example, English"
8110,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"savants usually, like Mr. Leaf, make no objections to the unity of"
8111,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the _Odyssey_. They do not read it in the same spirit, or torment it"
8112,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"in the same style, as they rack and lacerate the _Iliad_. With Wolf,"
8113,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"they recognise its unity, though it arose in the same dark age, and"
8114,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,passed through the same adventures as the _Iliad_. Yet in Germany the
8115,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,_Odyssey_ is even more and more variously lacerated than the _Iliad_.
8116,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8117,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Turning to the most recent English book on the subject, _Homer and"
8118,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the Iliad_, by Miss Stawell (1909), we find that while she rejects"
8119,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"6,000 out of 15,000 lines as non-original, she cannot believe in the"
8120,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"critics' ""original _Menis_"" of only some 2500 lines. She, like the"
8121,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"rest, believes (what Wolf did not believe) ""that it is quite possible"
8122,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"to disentangle the original core of the _Iliad_ from the present mass."""
8123,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"But of her _Iliad_, her ""core"" is by far the greater part, not a poor"
8124,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"sixth. I am tempted to quote a long passage from Miss Stawell, because"
8125,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"it seems to contain sound sense, and to be guided by fine literary"
8126,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,appreciation.
8127,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8128,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""The reconstructions actually proposed seem open to serious"
8129,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,criticisms. It appears to me that certain important
8130,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"considerations have been overlooked, and that in their"
8131,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,light we should discover the original to be far more
8132,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,like the _Iliad_ as we have it now than has usually been
8133,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,supposed.
8134,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8135,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"In the first place, much of the traditional poem has"
8136,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,scarcely had a fair chance at the hands of modern critics.
8137,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Scenes where the drift and bearing are not obvious at
8138,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,once have been cut away without further thought. But a
8139,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,great dramatic poem does not give up all its secrets at
8140,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,once. There are subtle harmonies that can only be realised
8141,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,clearly after long and sympathetic study: the work on
8142,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Shakespeare might suffice to prove this. And Homer, like"
8143,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Shakespeare, can put in very important points very quietly."
8144,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"We may miss them, and that is our loss. The poet will not"
8145,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,over-emphasise them for our sakes. Therefore it is not
8146,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,enough to ask ourselves whether such and such a passage
8147,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,could be cut out and the story still hang together; we
8148,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"must ask, further, whether the omission really leaves the"
8149,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"figures as solid, the story as enthralling, the background"
8150,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"as grand, as before. I feel sure that the full consequences"
8151,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,of their own excisions have not always been noticed by the
8152,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,critics who have made them. They cannot entirely strip
8153,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"away the memory of the ""later accretions""; there are even"
8154,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"instances of their praising the recovered ""original"" for"
8155,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,effects which could not have been obtained without the
8156,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""later interpolations."""
8157,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8158,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Secondly, a theory of ""accretions"" that is formed to"
8159,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"account for glaring discrepancies brings, or should bring,"
8160,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,with it a clear presumption against a certain type of
8161,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"excision. _To cut away not only individual scenes, but all"
8162,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"allusions to such, however numerous, however far apart,"
8163,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"however skilfully inwoven with their context, on the plea"
8164,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"that they were added in order to harmonise old and new, is"
8165,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,surely to prove too much. If the need for adjustment was
8166,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"felt to this extent, if the adjustment was done with this"
8167,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"delicate care, how did it ever happen that the gross blots"
8168,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,were allowed to enter or remain?_ That many scholars do
8169,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,overlook this difficulty will be shown in detail later--for
8170,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"instance, in the matter of Achilles' armour. The fact is"
8171,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"that, on any theory, it must be admitted that the _Iliad_,"
8172,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"as we have it, shows, again and again, the marks of"
8173,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,carelessness at the joints. Whole scenes and passages which
8174,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"do not cohere with the rest have got into the poem somehow,"
8175,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,and have been left there. This is perfectly intelligible on
8176,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"a theory of loose additions, afterwards piously preserved"
8177,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,in one block without any attempt at elaborate harmonising
8178,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,between old and new; but a critical theory that assumes
8179,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"throughout the growth and the editing, _a constant union of"
8180,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"gross carelessness and minute care, is liable to just the"
8181,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,same objection as the old theory of a great but negligent
8182,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,poet. It will not stand the test of thinking out in detail_.
8183,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8184,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"I have frequently insisted (in _Homer and the Epic,_ 1893) on the"
8185,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"points in the italicised passages. In the present book, which merely"
8186,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"tries to prove that the poems are the work of a single pre-ionic age, I"
8187,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,cannot again examine the numerous allegations of glaring discrepancies
8188,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"in the _Iliad_, such as no one sane poet could commit. As has been"
8189,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"often proved, notably by Colonel Mure, the greatest fictitious"
8190,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"narratives, known to be by a single hand in each case, contain"
8191,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,discrepancies at least as remarkable as any that can be proved to occur
8192,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,in Homer. I have also argued that many of Homer's supposed faults
8193,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"exist only in the imagination of the learned. I cannot then, again,"
8194,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"examine all, or even many of the imaginary inconsistencies: three of"
8195,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,the most glaring must suffice. But I take advantage of a critique by
8196,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"a distinguished scholar, Mr. Verrall, to meet certain preliminary"
8197,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"objections which he states. In _The Quarterly Review_,[1] Mr. Verrall"
8198,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,writes concerning me:
8199,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8200,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""But when we turn to other parts, equally essential, of his"
8201,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"argument for single authorship, our feeling always is that,"
8202,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"in reality, he begs the question. He maintains, if we do"
8203,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"not mistake, that there is no difficulty in supposing the"
8204,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"_Iliad_, as we have it, to be the work of one poet; that"
8205,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the alleged dislocations, wanderings, inconsistencies of"
8206,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the story, so far as they exist at all, are nothing more"
8207,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"than, from common experience, we might naturally expect in"
8208,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"a single author. When he comes to establish this in detail,"
8209,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"his procedure is to take the allegations separately, and"
8210,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"to ask, in each case, whether it is inconceivable that the"
8211,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,discrepancy (if allowed) is due to oversight on the part of
8212,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,the single composer. On these lines we may make short work.
8213,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Hardly any error whatever of this sort is inconceivable,"
8214,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"and hardly any, by itself, can be improbable. It would be"
8215,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"nothing at all that, once in a way, Homer should forget"
8216,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,that his Greek camp had a wall. We could scarcely call it
8217,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"inconceivable that, having himself described the 'Sending"
8218,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"of Patroclus' with one set of circumstances, he should"
8219,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,make his Thetis relate it with a totally different set.
8220,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"If such flaws were few and miscellaneous, and if there"
8221,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"were external testimony to the single authorship, we would"
8222,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,pass them without a murmur. Mr. Lang always does argue on
8223,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"this head as if they were few, as if they had no apparent"
8224,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"relation to one another, and, above all, as if single"
8225,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,authorship were a _datum_. Any explanation will serve where
8226,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,none is necessary; and consequently Mr. Lang's explanations
8227,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,often seem to us hardly serious.
8228,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8229,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""We will give one specimen. In Book ix. the Greek camp has"
8230,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"a wall (vv. 69-87). At the beginning of Book x., Agamemnon"
8231,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"at night, looking from his tent on the plain, sees the"
8232,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"'many watch-fires' of the Trojans, who, on this particular"
8233,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"night, are camping out before the city on the same plain."
8234,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"The wall is gone, as it does go and come throughout the"
8235,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,fighting scenes of the _Iliad_. Nor is this a momentary
8236,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"inadvertence; for through the whole of Book x., though its"
8237,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"story is such that the wall, if there, must be visible"
8238,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"to the narrator (so to say) constantly, though the camp"
8239,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"boundary is passed several times, never is there trace of"
8240,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"anything but a ditch. We say that, for a composition meant"
8241,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"to be continuous as it now stands, this is a most uncommon"
8242,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,and surprising phenomenon; nor is it intelligible to us
8243,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"that any one so far should disagree. Mr. Lang, in a special"
8244,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"chapter on Book x., disposes of the matter thus:"
8245,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8246,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""'Agamemnon hears the music of the joyous Trojan pipes and"
8247,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"flutes, and sees the reflected glow of their camp fires,"
8248,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"we must suppose, for he could not see the fires themselves"
8249,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"through the new wall of his own camp, as critics very"
8250,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"wisely remark' (_Homer and his Age,_ p. 260)."
8251,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8252,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""'We must suppose.' But how can we suppose anything of"
8253,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,the sort? '_Many_ fires' are not a glow. If the point were
8254,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"merely that the wall is ignored in this passage, let us say"
8255,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"simply that the poet forgot it. But the point is, that the"
8256,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"wall is ignored consistently throughout the Book, and that,"
8257,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"all about the poem, similar traces of ignorance respecting"
8258,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,this vitally important object are found from time to time.
8259,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,If that is a phenomenon commonly observed in narratives
8260,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"known to be from one hand, or otherwise designed for"
8261,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"continuity, let some of these narratives be produced for"
8262,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"comparison."""
8263,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8264,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Mr. Verrall argues, we see, that I ask, in each case, ""is this"
8265,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"discrepancy too bad for a single author?"" but neglect the cumulative"
8266,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"weight of _all_ the discrepancies. That is not, consciously, my"
8267,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,method; that fallacy I seek to avoid. I try to prove that most of the
8268,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,discrepancies which I examine are not really discrepancies at all--have
8269,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"_no_ weight,--and a mass of such imponderable objections has no"
8270,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,cumulative ponderosity. I do argue that the actual inconsistencies are
8271,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"comparatively few, not more or worse than the similar inconsistencies"
8272,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"in the _Aeneid_, or _Don Quixote_."
8273,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8274,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"But Mr. Verrall thinks that my explanations, or defences, of the"
8275,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"alleged discrepancies ""often seem hardly serious."" He gives one example"
8276,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"of my deplorable flippancy from _Iliad_, Book x. Now I readily grant"
8277,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"to Mr. Verrall that I had no right to explain Agamemnon's view, from"
8278,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"bed, in his hut, of the Trojan camp-fires beyond the wall of the Greek"
8279,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,camp as merely the glow in the sky caused by these fires.[2] As Mr.
8280,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Leaf puts it, ""the poet does not seem to have a very vivid picture of"
8281,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the situation."" In bed, in a hut (x. 11-14), Agamemnon could only see"
8282,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the Trojan fires on the rising ground beyond the wall, _and_ the Greek"
8283,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"ships, ""in his mind's eye."""
8284,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8285,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"But Mr. Verrall proceeds to give a fine example of what I call ""an"
8286,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"imaginary discrepancy."" ""The wall is gone.... Nor is this a momentary"
8287,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"inadvertence; for through the whole of Book x., though its story is"
8288,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"such that the wall, if there, must be visible to the narrator (so to"
8289,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"say) constantly, though the camp boundary is passed several times,"
8290,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"never is there trace of anything but a ditch."""
8291,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8292,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,This is merely an inadvertent misstatement of fact. Not only the
8293,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"new fosse round the Greek camp, but the gates of the new wall are"
8294,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"mentioned. No wall, no gates!"
8295,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8296,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Let us examine the history of wall, gates, and ditch. ""In Book ix."
8297,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"69-87 the Greek camp has a wall."" The nature of the wall is explained"
8298,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,by Nestor in Book vii. 337-343. The wall-making is similarly described
8299,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"in 437-441. The wall has (1) towers, (2) gates (or one gate), ""that"
8300,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"through them (or it) may be a way for chariot-driving,"" and (3) there"
8301,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"is ""a deep foss hard by to be about it,"" with a palisade, to ""hinder"
8302,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the horses and footmen"" of the Trojans.[3]"
8303,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8304,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Now, even if only the fosse were mentioned in Book x., that fosse is"
8305,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,part of the fortification first made and mentioned in Books vii. viii.
8306,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"and ix. 87, 88, where the advanced guard takes position ""between the"
8307,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"fosse and the wall."" Precisely there, Agamemnon, in Book x. 126, 127,"
8308,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"expects to find the advanced guard. The poet, in Book x., has certainly"
8309,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"not forgotten the fortification of Books vii. viii. ix., for he does"
8310,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"not merely, as Mr. Verrall declares, mention the fosse, though why does"
8311,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"he do so, if he forgets the wall which was made at the same time? By"
8312,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,a negative hallucination Mr. Verrall has failed to see that he also
8313,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"mentions the gate. ""We will find the advanced guard _before the gate_,"""
8314,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,says Agamemnon (x. 126).
8315,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8316,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Now no mortal can assert that when a poet mentions the gate, he"
8317,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,mentions nothing but the fosse! Both fosse and gates are _new_: the
8318,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,gates are a necessary part of the wall; and only a critic on the search
8319,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,for a discrepancy could overlook the fact that the poet of Book x.
8320,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,knows all about the fortification of Books vii. viii. ix. The poet
8321,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"has no occasion to say ""the gates _in the wall_""; the gates could be"
8322,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"nowhere else. Had there been a wall with no gates, which is absurd, the"
8323,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"poet would have had to make the princes scale the wall; and, had he"
8324,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"known nothing about the new fortification, he could not have mentioned"
8325,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,the new gates and the new fosse.
8326,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8327,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"I repeat, in ix. 65, 88, Nestor bids the advanced post take position;"
8328,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"and they do so, ""betwixt fosse and wall""; and there, ""before the gate"""
8329,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"(x. 126, 127), Agamemnon expects to find them. The ""discrepancy"" is due"
8330,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,to Mr. Verrall's imagination.
8331,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8332,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Before accusing Homer of extraordinary discrepancies, we ought to read"
8333,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,him with ordinary care.
8334,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8335,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Knowing the new fosse, and the new gate, both of them unheard of"
8336,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"before Book vii., the poet is beyond doubt acquainted with the whole"
8337,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"of the new fortification. ""The analytic reader,"" for whom Homer did"
8338,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"not sing, catches him at another place. How did Dolon expect to creep"
8339,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"among the host, when there was a wall? How was he to enter? We can"
8340,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"only reply that if he found the advanced post drowsy, he must enter in"
8341,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the darkness, by climbing up ""where the wall was built lowest."" The"
8342,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"host was suspected to be meditating flight, and, in their confusion,"
8343,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"_keeping no guard_, so Hector fancied (x. 310-312)."
8344,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8345,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Mr. Verrall says that in Book x. ""the wall is gone, as it does go and"
8346,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"come throughout the fighting scenes of the _Iliad_."" I have carefully"
8347,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"re-read Books xi.-xv., in which the wall is of importance, and find"
8348,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"no moment in which the wall is absent when, if present, it ought to"
8349,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,be mentioned. It is true that Mr. Leaf infers that it was absent in
8350,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"a portion of the poem earlier than our present _Iliad_, but that is"
8351,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,merely a conjecture of his own. He also says (Introduction to Book
8352,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"xiii.) that the _Aristeia of Idomeneus_ (xiii. 29-518) ""altogether"
8353,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"ignores the wall."" The whole passage is occupied with fighting"
8354,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"_within_ the wall, which the Trojans have entered _en masse_. The"
8355,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"reader or listener knows that, and the poet has no sort of reason for"
8356,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"mentioning the wall. But he remembers that the Trojan chariots, except"
8357,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"that of Asius, stopped and were arrayed at the ditch, so (xiii. 535,"
8358,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"536), the wounded Deiphobus, like the stricken Hector later, is carried"
8359,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"out of the fight ""to the swift horses that waited for him behind the"
8360,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"battle, with the charioteer and chariot,"" and is conveyed to Troy."
8361,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"The wall is never forgotten, though the description of simultaneous"
8362,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,confused fighting at several points is not a model of lucid military
8363,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"history. So much for ""the heavy and the weary weight of all this"
8364,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"unintelligible"" wall. The alleged discrepancy in Book x., insisted on"
8365,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"by Mr. Verrall, is an imaginary discrepancy; a thousand such would,"
8366,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"collectively, be imponderable."
8367,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8368,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"We now turn to what Mr. Leaf calls ""a crying contradiction, a"
8369,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"contradiction perhaps the most patent in the _Iliad_, which can in no"
8370,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"way be palliated."" Mr. Leaf's point is that ""the words (and acts) of"
8371,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Diomedes in vi. 123-143"" are ""in crying contradiction"" with ""the words"
8372,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"of Athene in v. 124-132, and the subsequent victories of Diomedes"
8373,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"over the gods.""[4] In fact, Diomedes, in _Iliad_, vi. 123-129, doubts"
8374,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"whether Glaucus, whom he has not encountered before, be a man or a god,"
8375,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"and says that he will not, if the stranger be a god, fight against"
8376,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,him. He then adds (130-143) the story of the punishment of Lycurgus
8377,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"by Zeus, when Lycurgus had beaten the Maenads, and driven Dionysus to"
8378,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"seek refuge with Thetis. The whole passage is easily detachable, and"
8379,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"may, Mr. Leaf says, be the work of ""some pious revivalist; the Bacchic"
8380,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"worship was unknown to the Achaean heroes."" We cannot be certain that"
8381,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,they did not know the _Thracian_ myth which Diomedes tells: this they
8382,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"might know, though they did not worship Dionysus, who, like Demeter,"
8383,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,is scarcely alluded to in the _Iliad_[5]
8384,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8385,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"But the point is, are the words of Diomedes to Glaucus in crying"
8386,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"contradiction with the words of Athene in v. 124-132, and with"
8387,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Diomedes' ""subsequent victories over the gods?"" First, he had but one"
8388,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"such victory; encouraged by Athene, he wounded--the harmless Aphrodite!"
8389,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"We quote the words of Athene to Diomedes: ""Moreover, I have taken"
8390,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"from thine eyes the mist that erst was on them, that thou mayest well"
8391,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"discern both god and man. Therefore, if any god come hither to make"
8392,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"trial of thee, fight not thou face to face with any of the immortal"
8393,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"gods; save only if Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, enter into the battle,"
8394,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"her smite thou with the keen bronze."""
8395,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8396,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"The subsequent events are _(Iliad_, v. 330-340), Diomede scratched the"
8397,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"hand of Aphrodite with his spear-point. Much encouraged, he tries to"
8398,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"spear Aeneas, over whom Apollo has spread his arms. Apollo threatens"
8399,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,and terrifies him (434-442). Diomedes has now had enough of braving the
8400,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,gods. He gives way; and bids his men give way when he sees Ares with
8401,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Hector (601-606). But Hera and Athene have the command of Zeus to stop
8402,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the fighting of Ares (765, 766), and Athene bids Diomedes attack the"
8403,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"god. He refuses, ""You bade me fight no god but Aphrodite"" (819-824)."
8404,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Athene thrusts away Diomedes' charioteer, drives his chariot against"
8405,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Ares, grasps and turns the spear of that god, and _herself_ drives the"
8406,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"spear of Diomedes into the belly of the god, and withdraws the spear"
8407,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,(825-859).
8408,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8409,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"This is no victory of Diomedes', and he knows it. It is, says Homer,"
8410,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Athene who has stopped Ares in his manslayings (see 909). Athene and
8411,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Hera now leave the field; Ares has fled, no god is any longer present."
8412,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"It is after the retiral of all the gods, notably of her who had given"
8413,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"him, ""for this occasion only,"" the gift of knowing god from man, that"
8414,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Diomedes doubts whether Glaucus, whom he has not encountered before,"
8415,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"be divine or human. Having been terrified by Apollo, and remembering"
8416,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Athene's command to fight no god but Aphrodite, Diomedes is naturally"
8417,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"cautious, in view of a splendid unknown antagonist, and asks, ""Who of"
8418,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"mortals, sir, art thou, for never have I seen thee before? thou alone"
8419,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"darest to meet my deadly spear. If thou art an immortal, then I will"
8420,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"not fight with the gods of heaven.""[6]"
8421,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8422,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"The gift of Athene, the discerning of gods from men, has lapsed when it"
8423,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"ceased to serve her turn, now that her task is ended. She has fulfilled"
8424,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the command of Zeus, has stopped Ares, and has retired to Olympus;"
8425,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"while no god is left in the field to be discerned. To this is reduced,"
8426,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"when we look at the facts, ""a contradiction perhaps the most patent in"
8427,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the _Iliad_, and one which can in no way be palliated."" The audience of"
8428,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Homer would understand, naturally, but ""the analytic reader,"" in hot"
8429,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"search of discrepancies, credits Diomedes with ""victories over gods"""
8430,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"which he did not gain, and overlooks his caution, and his obedience to"
8431,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,the command of Athene. What must the other contradictions be when this
8432,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"is ""perhaps the most patent""?"
8433,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8434,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,A yet more scandalous discrepancy in the _Iliad_ remains to be noticed.
8435,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""It is a contradiction,"" says Mr. Leaf with manly indignation, ""at the"
8436,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"very root of the story, as flagrant as if Shakespeare had forgotten"
8437,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,in the Fifth Act of _Macbeth_ that Duncan had been murdered in the
8438,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"second.""[7] If Shakespeare had made that error, and, like Fielding, had"
8439,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"told his manager that the public would never notice it; like Fielding,"
8440,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"when he heard the hisses and catcalls, he would probably have murmured,"
8441,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""Damn them, they _have_ found it out!"" But though Homer's error was as"
8442,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"flagrant as the suggested resuscitation of the gracious Duncan, for"
8443,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"three thousand years nobody ""found it out."" It was discovered by Mr."
8444,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Grote, an excellent banker, but no great poetical critic; and by a"
8445,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"German who, in search of discrepancies, had been ""nosing the body"" of"
8446,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Homer ""with passionate attention."""
8447,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8448,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Now an error cannot be blazingly flagrant, nor vociferously crying,"
8449,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"if it escapes a hundred generations of hearers, readers, Pisistratean"
8450,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""recensors,"" and Alexandrian and modern Editors. Moreover, if the"
8451,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Greek recensors laboured to harmonise old and new by skilfully
8452,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"interwoven cross-references (and the critics tell us that they did),"
8453,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""how,"" as Miss Stawell asks, ""did it ever happen that the gross blots"
8454,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"were allowed to enter or remain?"" That _this_ blunder was allowed to"
8455,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"remain, unnoted and unrebuked, till about 1840 A.D., proves beyond"
8456,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"contradiction that, at least, it is not ""flagrant""; does not resemble"
8457,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the appearance of Duncan in Act V. of _Macbeth_, when ""after life's"
8458,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"fitful fever he sleeps well,"" in Act III. Mr. Leaf only shows us how"
8459,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"far a passion for discovering discrepancies, if not early checked, may"
8460,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,hurry the learned.
8461,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8462,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Again, if Homer's blunder were as glaring as the forgetfulness by the"
8463,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"author of _Macbeth_ that Duncan had been murdered, it is unlikely that,"
8464,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"by ""Bergk, Hentze, Monro, and Lang,"" to quote Mr. Leaf, Homer would be"
8465,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,pronounced innocent.[8]
8466,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8467,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"We have ""weakened some of the chief arguments stated by Grote,"" that is"
8468,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"admitted, ""yet their general force is unshaken."" How this can possibly"
8469,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"be, if Grote's chief arguments are sensibly weakened, does not appear;"
8470,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,for the general force must be shaken when some of the chief arguments
8471,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,which make up that force are impaired.
8472,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8473,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Grote's chief argument is that the poet who composed Books xi.-xvi.
8474,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""could not have had present to his mind the main event of the ninth"
8475,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Book,--the out-pouring of profound humiliation by the Greeks, and from"
8476,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Agamemnon specially, before Achilles, coupled with formal offers to"
8477,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"restore Briseis, and pay the amplest compensation for past wrong. The"
8478,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"words of Achilles (not less than those of Patroclus and Nestor), in the"
8479,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"eleventh and the following Books, plainly imply that the humiliation"
8480,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"of the Greeks before him, for which he thirsts, is as yet future and"
8481,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"contingent.""[9]"
8482,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8483,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Here Grote and his followers appear to forget that, from the very"
8484,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"first, in Book i., the heart of Achilles was set on _revenge_, and"
8485,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"on one definitely stated form of revenge, and _not_ on atonement. On"
8486,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,this point Grote had not Book i. present in _his_ mind: he says that
8487,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Achilles asks no more from Thetis, nor Thetis anything more from Zeus,"
8488,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"than that ""the Greeks may be brought to know the wrong they have done,"
8489,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"and be humbled in the dust in expiation of it."" This is an egregiously"
8490,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,absurd misstatement! It seems that the great historian forgot to verify
8491,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"his reference, with the usual result, a misstatement of fact as the"
8492,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,basis of a charge of discrepancy. What Achilles bids Thetis ask from
8493,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Zeus is, ""_hem the Achaeans among their ships' sterns about the bay_,"
8494,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"that they may make trial of their king....""[10] Achilles does desire"
8495,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the humiliation of Agamemnon, but that humiliation must arise from a"
8496,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,massacre of the Greeks _among their ships' sterns_; and from their
8497,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,prospect of annihilation.
8498,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8499,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Already, to Agamemnon, during the quarrel in Book i., Achilles had said"
8500,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"that his day will come ""when multitudes fall dying before manslaying"
8501,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Hector.""[11] In the state of affairs in Book ix. no great multitudes"
8502,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"have fallen before Hector. Zeus again, in Book viii., promises to"
8503,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"fulfil the desire of Achilles to the letter. ""Headlong Hector shall"
8504,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,not refrain from battle till that Peleus' son shall have arisen beside
8505,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the ships, on that day _when these shall fight amid the sterns in"
8506,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,most grievous stress around Patroclus fallen. Such is the doom of
8507,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"heaven_.""[12] Achilles cannot be reconciled and take arms till the doom"
8508,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,is fulfilled.
8509,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8510,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Not only does Homer keep the prayer of Achilles in Book i. constantly
8511,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"in view till it is accomplished in Book xv., but after its"
8512,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,accomplishment he returns to and insists on the fulfilment by Zeus of
8513,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,this rash prayer. The whole burden of the _Iliad_ rests on this prayer
8514,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"of Book i., and in its disastrous consequences not only to the host,"
8515,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"but to Achilles. In Book xvi. 97-100, a part of the _genuine kernel_,"
8516,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Homer makes the last words that Achilles ever spoke to Patroclus
8517,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,express a fury of revenge which Nemesis could not pardon.
8518,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8519,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""Would, O Father Zeus, and Athene, and Apollo, would that not one of"
8520,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"all the Trojans might escape death, nor one of the Argives, but that"
8521,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"we twain might avoid destruction, that alone we might undo the sacred"
8522,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"coronal of Troy."""
8523,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8524,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"This is the very extreme of pride and passion, an extreme which Greek"
8525,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"thought regarded as entailing its own inevitable punishment. Achilles,"
8526,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"when the news of the death of Patroclus reaches him, recognises this."
8527,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Thetis says, ""My child, why weepest thou?... One thing at least hath"
8528,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,been accomplished of Zeus according to the prayer thou madest ... that
8529,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the sons of the Achaeans should all be pent in at the ships, through"
8530,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"lack of thee, and should suffer hateful things."""
8531,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8532,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Achilles answers, ""My mother, that prayer hath the Olympian"
8533,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"accomplished for me. But what delight have I therein, since Patroclus"
8534,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"is dead?""[13] Observe that the critics, and even Miss Stawell, think"
8535,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Achilles too sweet to refuse atonement in Book ix. There is not much
8536,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,sweetness of soul in his furious desire for the complete destruction of
8537,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,the Greeks in his very last words to his friend in Book xvi.
8538,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8539,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Thus, from first to last, Achilles asks nothing less than what Zeus,"
8540,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"in Book viii., just prior to the impeached Book ix., declares that"
8541,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"he shall receive,--the massacre of the Achaeans among the sterns of"
8542,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,their ships. Grote has misstated the facts of the case. He represents
8543,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,that the Embassy of Book ix. offered Achilles all his heart's desire.
8544,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"This they did not and could not do, they had not been slain among the"
8545,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,ships; they had not been put in deadly stress; and Achilles would be
8546,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"inconsistent if he accepted atonement before he got revenge, before"
8547,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"instant ruin was upon the Achaeans. ""Agamemnon,"" says Achilles in"
8548,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Book ix., ""shall not persuade me"" (by gifts richer than he offers),"
8549,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""_till he have paid me back all the bitter despite_.""[14] A payment"
8550,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,in gold and lands and women Achilles disdains: he will not take it
8551,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"till he has a payment in revenge. This he has insisted on in Book i.,"
8552,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"this Zeus has promised in Book viii., and this inexorableness is the"
8553,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,sin and stumbling-block of Achilles. Customary law and public opinion
8554,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"acknowledged his right to apology and atonement, but condemned his"
8555,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"insistence, after these had been duly offered, on a bloody revenge."
8556,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,All the world recognised the facts before Grote went hunting for
8557,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"discrepancies, and bagged the greatest of all,--which is no discrepancy!"
8558,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8559,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"The whole story, including Book ix., is absolutely consistent. Grote"
8560,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"argued that Agamemnon, by his offers, had done all that was necessary."
8561,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"He _had_, according to customary law; but Achilles had set his heart,"
8562,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"in Book i. as in Book ix., on much more, on ""a contented revenge."" In"
8563,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Book ix. he had not enjoyed his revenge, and he said as much. Had he"
8564,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"yielded in Book ix., the prophecy of Zeus in Book viii. would have been"
8565,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,falsified;[15] the doom of Zeus would have been frustrated; the bitter
8566,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,word of Achilles would have been broken; he would have deserved no
8567,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"heart-breaking disaster. Grote sees nothing of all this, nor do his"
8568,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,followers.
8569,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8570,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,When Agamemnon sent his embassy with apologies and offers of atonement
8571,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"to Achilles, in Book ix., the Achaeans had not been punished as"
8572,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Achilles, from the first, expressed his desire to see them smitten."
8573,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Diomedes had shore in the day of his valour, his _aristeia_; Hector had"
8574,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,the worse in his passage-of-arms with Aias; Hera and Athene had abetted
8575,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the Trojans; and though they camped in the plain, they had not smitten"
8576,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the foe ""by the prows of the ships""; nor were they even likely to do"
8577,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"so, for the Achaeans had built the wall and dug the trench around the"
8578,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,ships. Therefore the demand of Achilles was not yet granted; and though
8579,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Agamemnon abjectly implored forgiveness and offered the customary
8580,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"atonement, _that_ was not what Achilles wanted. He spurns the gifts,"
8581,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"and repeats the whole long story of his wrongs.[16] Agamemnon, he says,"
8582,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,_has a ceaseless grudge against him_: the king's submission is merely
8583,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"hypocritical, and Achilles declines to be deceived. ""Let him not tempt"
8584,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"me, who know him too well; he will not persuade me""[17] ""His gifts"
8585,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"are hateful to me""; not for ten times these gifts will Achilles be"
8586,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"reconciled, till he has glutted his revenge."
8587,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8588,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"The long speech of Phoenix[18] partly mollifies him, and, in place of"
8589,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"persisting in his intention to sail homewards at once, he tells Aias"
8590,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"that he will not fight till Hector comes, slaying the Argives, even to"
8591,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,the ships of the Myrmidons.[19] This is an advance even on his demand
8592,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"in Book i. In short, Achilles abides by his determination as announced"
8593,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"to his mother in the first Book of the _Iliad_, and goes further. He is"
8594,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,consistent.
8595,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8596,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"To this resolve, and to his plighted word (for he ""hated a liar as"
8597,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the gates of Hades""), Achilles is as constant as the _fond_ of his"
8598,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,character--an unexampled tenderness--permitted him to be. This
8599,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"tenderness of the fierce hero who, in grief, cries to his mother"
8600,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"like a child; who, in the height of his passion, compares his own"
8601,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"labours for the Achaeans to those of ""the hen-bird that brings to her"
8602,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"unfledged chickens whatsoever morsel she may find, and it goes hard"
8603,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"with herself"";[20] who likens the suppliant Patroclus to ""the little"
8604,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"girl that, running beside her mother, and catching at her skirts, cries"
8605,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"to be taken up in her arms""; and who gives quarter to fallen foes,"
8606,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,distinguishes Achilles. The contrast between this emotion and his
8607,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,pride and later ferocity makes his character; and his chivalry shines
8608,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"out most clearly in his reception of Priam, which is declared to be"
8609,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"un-Homeric! The triumph of his fierce pride over his tenderness, when"
8610,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"he refuses the gifts in Book ix., is the [Greek: amartêma], the sin or"
8611,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"blot on a noble character, which is the keynote, or pivot, of Greek"
8612,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"tragedy (as in the _Oedipous Tyrannos_), and of the _Iliad_."
8613,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8614,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Remove Book ix., and Achilles is no longer himself, there is no motived"
8615,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"tragedy, and the supposed primal kernel, the fancied _Achilleid_"
8616,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"(wherein atonement is not offered or refused), is a poem without a"
8617,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"motive. The heart of Achilles is to be broken by the loss of Patroclus,"
8618,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"though, according to the ideas of the age, he has committed no wrong;"
8619,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,he has renounced his allegiance when he had a right to renounce it till
8620,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,he had received atonement for an intolerable injustice.
8621,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8622,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Grote did not think himself back into the legal and ethical atmosphere
8623,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,of Homeric life; he and his followers have failed to understand
8624,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the moral centre of the tragedy, the [Greek: amartêma], the sin of"
8625,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Achilles. In place of doing that they have found the great discrepancy,"
8626,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,exactly where they should have found the central situation and turning
8627,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"point of the epic. It has, in Aristotelian phrase, ""a beginning, a"
8628,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"middle, and an end."" Book ix. is the middle. The critics excise it!"
8629,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8630,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Grote works out his discovery thus, and in answering him we answer"
8631,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"his contemporary followers. Achilles, in Book xi., sees the rout of"
8632,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the Achaeans, and sees Nestor conveying a wounded comrade to the"
8633,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"rear. Achilles says to Patroclus (xi. 608), ""_Now_ methinks that the"
8634,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Achaeans will stand about my knees, praying to me, _for need no longer"
8635,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"endurable is coming upon them""_ That is, he will soon get the terms"
8636,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"which he has from the first demanded, revenge, and, _following perfect"
8637,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"revenge_, the humiliation of the Achaeans. Grote says that Heyne ""not"
8638,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"unnaturally asks, 'had Achilles repented of his previous harshness"
8639,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"to the embassy,' in Book ix., 'or was he arrogant enough to expect a"
8640,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"second embassy'? I answer, 'Neither one nor the other: the words imply"
8641,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"that he had received _no embassy at all_.'"" Therefore Book ix. is a"
8642,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,later interpolation.
8643,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8644,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"It follows that the great poet of Book ix., who so consistently"
8645,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"maintains the attitude taken by Achilles in Book i. 408-410, where the"
8646,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"hero demands the slaughter of the Achaeans among their ships,[21] now"
8647,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,unscrupulously throws over and destroys the work of his still greater
8648,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,predecessor. Here is indeed a matchless discrepancy in human nature!
8649,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8650,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"As I understand the words of Achilles (xi. 608, 610), he is joyously"
8651,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"anticipating the moment when ""need no longer endurable"" will come on"
8652,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the host. In Book ix. their necessity, as we have demonstrated, had not"
8653,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"reached the point which, in Books i. and ix., he had demanded. Hector"
8654,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"has not yet reached the ships, not yet do the Achaeans know fully"
8655,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""what manner of king they have"" in his enemy, Agamemnon. Doubtless"
8656,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"they will again beseech Achilles: they have done that already, but"
8657,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,they have not yet suffered as he will have them suffer. There is here
8658,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"extreme consistency, not impossible inconsistency. Achilles retains the"
8659,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,position which he took up in Book i.
8660,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8661,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Grote pursues his theory to Book xvi., where Patroclus comes with news"
8662,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"that the Trojans are slaying _around the ships_, and that Agamemnon,"
8663,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Diomedes, Odysseus, and Eurypylus are wounded and out of action. As"
8664,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Achilles (Book ix.) has vowed not to fight till Hector attacks his own
8665,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"ships, Patroclus asks to be permitted to lead the Myrmidons into fight."
8666,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Achilles replies by rehearsing all his wrongs, and then says, ""But let"
8667,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,bygones be bygones ... verily I said that my wrath would not slacken
8668,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,one whit till the battle and the cry came to my own ships; but do
8669,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"_thou_ put on my armour and lead the Myrmidons.""[22]"
8670,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8671,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"He thus recalls his vow in Book ix., or rather, while keeping to the"
8672,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"letter of it, he makes a concession in the spirit: he is sated: what"
8673,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,he asked for in Book i. he has received in Book xvi. So the poet of
8674,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Book xvi. had Book ix. before him. The Achaeans are dying around the
8675,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"ships, but till Hector approaches his own ships he will not fight"
8676,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"in person. So he had vowed in Book ix. There is stern consistency,"
8677,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,not discrepancy; but Grote finds inconsistency by agreeing with
8678,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the Scholiast and Heyne in interpreting ""[Greek: _ephein ge_]"""
8679,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"(in its primary sense, ""I said"") ""as equivalent to 'I thought'"
8680,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"([Greek: dienoeitein]), not as referring to any express antecedent"
8681,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"declaration.""[23] Mr. Leaf agrees, and thinks that the declaration"
8682,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"of Achilles in Book ix. 650 ""may well have been suggested by this"
8683,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"very phrase."" This very phrase may therefore, confessedly, mean that"
8684,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Achilles _did_ make an express declaration; and we have every right so
8685,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"to understand it. If we do, the supposed discrepancy vanishes. If we"
8686,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"do not, we must suppose the poet of Book ix. to have been at once most"
8687,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"scrupulously attentive to the words of his predecessor,--the author of"
8688,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Book i., of Book viii., and of the opening of Book xvi.--and at the"
8689,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,same time absolutely regardless of that minstrel in the most important
8690,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,point. We only shift the insane error from one great poet to another.
8691,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8692,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Meanwhile Grote says that the poet of Book xi. _et seqq_. ""could not"
8693,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"have had present to his mind the main event of the ninth Book, the"
8694,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"embassy, and its offers of atonement.""[24]"
8695,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8696,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Next, in xvi. lines 72, 73, Achilles says that the Achaeans would"
8697,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"not be in such straits ""if Agamemnon had been but kindly disposed to"
8698,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"me."" But, in Book ix., says Grote, Agamemnon was more than kindly,"
8699,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,he offered to pay any price for reconciliation. So Achilles himself
8700,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"admitted in Book ix. Agamemnon would pay any price, but Achilles"
8701,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,regarded this as mere hypocrisy: he would not believe that Agamemnon
8702,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"was ""favourably disposed"" in his heart. ""He shall not deceive me, shall"
8703,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"not persuade me."" The poet has anticipated Grote's objection, but Grote"
8704,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,does not understand.
8705,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8706,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Achilles is not really in heart reconciled to Agamemnon, even after he"
8707,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,consents to take the gifts; is not reconciled till after the funeral
8708,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,games for Patroclus. At _this_ moment (xvi. 77) Achilles speaks of
8709,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Agamemnon as ""hateful."""
8710,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8711,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"In xvi. 83-86, to copy Grote's paraphrase, Achilles says to Patroclus,"
8712,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"""Obey my words, so that you may procure for me honour and glory _from"
8713,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the body of the Greeks_, and that they may send back to me the damsel,"
8714,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"giving me ample presents besides...."""
8715,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8716,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Grote has oddly misunderstood the whole story. He says, ""The ninth Book"
8717,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,_has actually_ tendered to Achilles everything he demands and even
8718,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"more."" Now Achilles had demanded only the massacre of the Greeks at the"
8719,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"ships, and then recognition of what kind of king they have. In what"
8720,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"passage does Achilles demand anything else? In none till, in Book xvi."
8721,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"84, 85, he bids Patroclus fight, when he himself will receive Briseis"
8722,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"and fair gifts: his revenge he has already enjoyed, but Phoenix had"
8723,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,warned him that he would be dishonoured if he fought without receiving
8724,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,atonement.
8725,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8726,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Grote, in the spirit of his school, rejects later allusions to the"
8727,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,offered atonement of Book ix. as interpolations thrust in for the
8728,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,sake of restoring harmony. Yet the cunning interpolators allowed the
8729,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Great Discrepancy to stand! If we may reject whatever lines destroy
8730,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"our theory, criticism is an idle game of contradictory conjectures,"
8731,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,each inquirer discerning interpolations in all passages that ruin his
8732,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"favourite hypothesis. After all Grote concludes, ""The poem consists of"
8733,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,a part original and other parts superadded; yet it is certainly not
8734,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,impossible that the author of the former may himself have composed the
8735,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"latter."" If so, ""the poet ... has not thought fit to recast the parts"
8736,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,and events in such manner as to impart to the whole a pervading thread
8737,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"of _consensus_ and organisation such as we see in the _Odyssey_.""[25]"
8738,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Thus the poet did not mind a ghastly discrepancy.
8739,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8740,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,I trust that all who have not invincible prepossessions will see that
8741,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Book ix. is not only consistent with Books xi. and xvi., but is the"
8742,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"very _clou_ of the _Iliad_, without which Achilles is not himself, and"
8743,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,the _Achilleid_ would have been a purposeless tragedy. This opinion is
8744,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"not based on aesthetic and literary criticism alone, but on the actual"
8745,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"ideas about allegiance, the wrongs done by the Over Lord, the rights of"
8746,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the injured vassal, and the rules concerning atonement which pervade"
8747,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the _Iliad_. As in all such early societies, a man was dishonoured if"
8748,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"he forgave a wrong without receiving atonement; and was blamed if, like"
8749,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Achilles, he refused atonement when it was offered with due ceremonial."
8750,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Even if students, under the suggestion of Grote, fail to accept my view"
8751,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"that Book ix. is no discrepancy, but contains the central moment, and,"
8752,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"as Phoenix's words in that Book prove, the _motif_ of the tragedy of"
8753,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Achilles--""he who refuses the prayers of the penitent may fall and"
8754,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"pay the price"" (ix. 512), I trust that, at least, I have proved that"
8755,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the discrepancy is not ""flagrant"" and ""crying,"" and an infallible proof"
8756,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,of late interpolation.
8757,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8758,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"It is not necessary for me to repeat my unanswered criticisms, in"
8759,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"_Homer and the Epic_, of many alleged discrepancies. If I have"
8760,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,succeeded in showing that the three most flagrant inconsistencies are
8761,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"not inconsistent, it is easy to imagine how innocent are most of the"
8762,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,other inculpated passages.
8763,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8764,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"One may be noted. In _Iliad_, xviii. 446-452, Thetis, who has gone to"
8765,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"ask Hephaestus to make armour for her son, explains the causes of his"
8766,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"mutiny. ""And the princes ([Greek: _gerontes_]) of the Argives entreated"
8767,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"him, and told over many noble gifts. Then albeit he refused to ward"
8768,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"destruction from them, he put his armour on Patroclus and sent him to"
8769,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the war."" The gifts were offered ""while Achilles in grief wasted his"
8770,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"heart, while the men of Troy were driving the Achaeans on their ships,"
8771,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"nor suffered them to come forth."""
8772,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8773,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"The gifts were offered, in fact, when the Greeks had found it necessary"
8774,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"to fortify their camp, purposing to act on the defensive; and Achilles"
8775,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,did not send out Patroclus in consequence of the offer of gifts.
8776,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Absorbed in her own grief for her son, whom she will never welcome"
8777,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"home (""excited,"" as Miss Stawell says), Thetis has avoided the point"
8778,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"of the question of Hephaestus, ""Why hast thou come hither?"" and poured"
8779,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"forth her own lament (430-441). ""Homer,"" says the Scholiast, ""renders"
8780,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the nature of woman, she does not answer the question put to her, but"
8781,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"dilates on her own sorrow."" Then she hurriedly and confusedly describes"
8782,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"the past events, hastening to her request that the god will make arms"
8783,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"for her Achilles. As Mr. Leaf writes, ""Though the reference (450, 451)"
8784,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"does not give the whole course of events, it is near enough--there is"
8785,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"only omission, not misstatement."" To myself the speech of Thetis seems"
8786,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,exactly what a distraught mother in a hurry would be apt to make.
8787,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8788,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"But Mr. Verrall takes it as proof positive that ""a new hand"" is at"
8789,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"work, the new hand who invented ""The Making of the Armour."" _He_--the"
8790,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"new hand--is in even a greater hurry, and is much more distraught than"
8791,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"poor Thetis, it seems to me; but then Mr. Verrall observes he did"
8792,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"not mean his story of the armour ""for a continuation of the other's,"
8793,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"otherwise he would have told the previous incident as he found it."""
8794,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Finally, some one, some time, for some reason--person, time, and reason"
8795,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"being all equally unknown--""takes the ""Sending of Patroclus"" from one"
8796,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"version and the ""Making of the Armour"" from another, and combines"
8797,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"without reconciling them.""[26]"
8798,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,
8799,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,"Here Mr. Verrall differs from Mr. Leaf, while we take it that"
8800,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,Homer makes a grief-distraught mother in a hurry speak like a
8801,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,grief-distraught and hurried mother.
8802,THE GREAT DISCREPANCIES,

8876,CONCLUSIONS,

9192,THE CATALOGUE,"Nestor, in _Iliad_, xi. 664-762,[1] telling a long story about his"

9195,THE CATALOGUE,Here the theory is that Nestor's story is by a late editor of the

9200,THE CATALOGUE,"journey of Telemachus, in the _Odyssey_, to Pylos, the home of Nestor,"

9219,THE CATALOGUE,"seems to be no valid reason for doubting that it, like the bulk of the"

9231,THE CATALOGUE,"""in other portions of the Epic Cycle."" The conclusion is that ""the"

9233,THE CATALOGUE,"composed for that portion of it which, as worked up into a separate"

9237,THE CATALOGUE,"separate poems, or whether such a nebulous cycle existed at all, we"
9238,THE CATALOGUE,know not. I must refer the reader to Mr. Allen's essay on the whole

9240,THE CATALOGUE,"""The Catalogue was taken by Homer from its time and place in saga to"
9241,THE CATALOGUE,"his second Book and to the Troad."" I do not quite understand how a long"

9272,APPENDIX B,The argument of my book is that the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ represent
9273,APPENDIX B,the usages and ideas of a prehistoric society. They are not the ideas
9274,APPENDIX B,"and usages of proto-historic and historic Hellas, but of the Achaean"
9275,APPENDIX B,"invaders, or, at least, of the high-born men and women to whom Homer"
9276,APPENDIX B,"sang. On the other hand, Mr. Murray, if I succeed in understanding his"
9277,APPENDIX B,"position, holds that the ideas and usages of the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_"
9278,APPENDIX B,"are a kind of mosaic, the result of a long process of ""expurgation"
9279,APPENDIX B,"of Homer."" If this view be correct, my whole argument, of course, is"
9280,APPENDIX B,builded on the sand. Homer does not represent the ethical and religious
9281,APPENDIX B,beliefs and usages of a moment in the past.
9282,APPENDIX B,
9283,APPENDIX B,"It is therefore necessary to state, with textual citations as full as"
9284,APPENDIX B,"possible, Mr. Murray's presentation of his case, given, first, in his"
9285,APPENDIX B,"_Rise of the Greek Epic_, and, later, in one of the Oxford Lectures"
9286,APPENDIX B,"by several authors, published in _Anthropology and the Classics_. Mr."
9287,APPENDIX B,Murray has very kindly assisted me by explaining points in which I
9288,APPENDIX B,was unable to follow his reasoning. But these explanations prove that
9289,APPENDIX B,we start from assumptions so opposed in their nature that community
9290,APPENDIX B,in conclusions is impossible. Perhaps even mutual intelligence cannot
9291,APPENDIX B,be perfect. Thus my reading of the Epics leads me to the conviction
9292,APPENDIX B,that they were composed in an age which knew nothing of coined money;
9293,APPENDIX B,an age when cattle were the standard of values:--this or that object
9294,APPENDIX B,was worth so many cows. But in Mr. Murray's opinion this standard was
9295,APPENDIX B,"preserved in the epics, after it was obsolete in practice, for reasons"
9296,APPENDIX B,of stylistic convention. While I suppose our two epics to have been
9297,APPENDIX B,"epics at a period very remote, when Achaean society was in its bloom;"
9298,APPENDIX B,he holds that there were no epics till the Achaeans and the conquered
9299,APPENDIX B,"peoples were intermingled. Earlier, there were only lays, and the"
9300,APPENDIX B,"silence of our epics as to coined money, for example, is a convention"
9301,APPENDIX B,derived from the lays of a time when cows were the measure of value.
9302,APPENDIX B,"Each of us, it seems to me, has to assume a kind of miracle. I have to"
9303,APPENDIX B,"think, and do think, that our epics were composed by a poet to amuse"
9304,APPENDIX B,"the leisure of an Achaean Court, and also that they were miraculously"
9305,APPENDIX B,"preserved, whether by writing or in memory, through several changeful"
9306,APPENDIX B,centuries. I believe that this occurred because the poems are great
9307,APPENDIX B,"harmonious structures, such as only a poet could produce; and because"
9308,APPENDIX B,"the many changes in society, costume, law, belief, and usage which the"
9309,APPENDIX B,"successive ages evolved, do not appear in the poems."
9310,APPENDIX B,
9311,APPENDIX B,"Mr. Murray, I think, has also to postulate another kind of miracle."
9312,APPENDIX B,"Evolution, in some way which I do not understand, produced our epics"
9313,APPENDIX B,out of a mass of floating poetical material. It appears that men are
9314,APPENDIX B,"born to hold one view or the other, to believe in one or the other"
9315,APPENDIX B,prodigy.
9316,APPENDIX B,
9317,APPENDIX B,"However, in the view which is not mine, stylistic conventions in the"
9318,APPENDIX B,later poetry were based on a following of what was no convention in
9319,APPENDIX B,"the older poetry, say as to the use of coined money or of cavalry. Now"
9320,APPENDIX B,"I know no other early national poetry, and no literary epics of the"
9321,APPENDIX B,"critical ages of Greek and Roman literature, where such convention is"
9322,APPENDIX B,employed. Virgil was learned; Virgil knew Homer intimately; yet his

9326,APPENDIX B,"To take another case, as soon as armorial bearings came into"
9327,APPENDIX B,"mediaeval Europe, the singers of the _chansons de geste_ introduced"
9328,APPENDIX B,"them,--regardless of their absence in the earlier lays, which knew no"
9329,APPENDIX B,such blazons. No convention of silence arose.
9330,APPENDIX B,
9331,APPENDIX B,There is only one mention of writing in Homer. The Greek tragedians
9332,APPENDIX B,"knew well that writing was, as far as Homer shows, very rare in the"
9333,APPENDIX B,heroic age. But some of the heroes and heroines write whenever they
9334,APPENDIX B,have occasion. There is no archaistic convention. As I have shown
9335,APPENDIX B,"in _Homer and his Age_, ancient poets and artists had, no more than"
9336,APPENDIX B,"Shakespeare, our modern habit of attending to ""local colour"" as"
9337,APPENDIX B,historically known to us by research.
9338,APPENDIX B,
9339,APPENDIX B,"Perhaps it may be urged in reply, that early mediaeval epic poets were"
9340,APPENDIX B,"much less conservative than early Greeks. They altered, for example,"
9341,APPENDIX B,"the assonant _laisses_ of the early _chansons_, and did them into"
9342,APPENDIX B,"rhyme, while Greece for epic purposes never deserted the hexameter. But"
9343,APPENDIX B,I can give a fair parallel to the Greek non-observance of a convention
9344,APPENDIX B,in the Irish epic cycles.
9345,APPENDIX B,
9346,APPENDIX B,"The poets of the ancient Irish cycle of Fian ought, by the theory of"
9347,APPENDIX B,"convention, to have made their heroes use war-chariots like the heroes"
9348,APPENDIX B,of the elder saga of Cuchullin. But they follow no such convention;
9349,APPENDIX B,"their heroes ride or fight on foot, because such was the nature of war"
9350,APPENDIX B,in their own later time.
9351,APPENDIX B,
9352,APPENDIX B,The same reasoning applies throughout. I cannot believe that the makers
9353,APPENDIX B,"of our epics, working in the early historic age, omitted mention of"
9354,APPENDIX B,"cavalry, coined money, periodical games, or anything else known to"
9355,APPENDIX B,"them, because they found no such matter in more ancient lays concerning"
9356,APPENDIX B,"and composed in a previous age. We have seen that the old ""non-Homeric"""
9357,APPENDIX B,"epics were, as their fragments prove, full of non-Homeric usages. No"
9358,APPENDIX B,"""stylistic convention"" forbade mention of these usages."
9359,APPENDIX B,
9360,APPENDIX B,Thus no such stylistic convention--maintained in our _Iliad_ and
9361,APPENDIX B,"_Odyssey_, neglected in the _Cypria, Aethiopis,_ and the rest--can be"
9362,APPENDIX B,"accepted. In fact, another and a special cause for many of Homer's"
9363,APPENDIX B,"silences has to be suggested, as we shall see. Once more it is my"
9364,APPENDIX B,"assumption that our epics were made in the main as we have them, for a"
9365,APPENDIX B,"peculiar audience, a courtly and knightly audience, known to themselves"
9366,APPENDIX B,"and their poet as ""Achaeans."" That they were of unmixed race I do not"
9367,APPENDIX B,"suppose; these Northern invaders, their chiefs at least, would marry"
9368,APPENDIX B,the daughters of the princes of the land. But I assume that our epics
9369,APPENDIX B,"were made for them, _while they retained their Northern ideas_; on"
9370,APPENDIX B,"many points very like the ideas, usages, and beliefs of the heathen"
9371,APPENDIX B,Scandinavian settlers in Iceland. It is maintained by Mr. Murray that
9372,APPENDIX B,"the ideas of ""the conquered races"" were very different, and that, as"
9373,APPENDIX B,"the two peoples mingled, the ideas of the conquered races re-emerged."
9374,APPENDIX B,"This is manifestly true. But my view is that Achaean society, courtly"
9375,APPENDIX B,"society at least, had not adopted the beliefs and usages of the"
9376,APPENDIX B,"conquered races at the time when our epics, which ignore them, were"
9377,APPENDIX B,composed. But these usages and ideas are usual in the fragments of the
9378,APPENDIX B,Cyclic epics on Trojan affairs. No stylistic convention interfered
9379,APPENDIX B,and kept them out. Mr. Murray has to discover a special cause for the
9380,APPENDIX B,"presence in the ""Cyclic"" of much that is absent from our two epics."
9381,APPENDIX B,
9382,APPENDIX B,"The ideas of Mr. Murray, in some passages of his work, appear to be"
9383,APPENDIX B,precisely the opposite of my own. In other passages we seem to be on
9384,APPENDIX B,the very point of agreement.
9385,APPENDIX B,
9386,APPENDIX B,"When we are told, in passages to be quoted, that there was in the"
9387,APPENDIX B,"formation of the _Iliad_, and to a less extent in that of the"
9388,APPENDIX B,"_Odyssey_, a strong element of reform and expurgation, we ask"
9389,APPENDIX B,"ourselves--who, in what age, and from what motives, were the reformers"
9390,APPENDIX B,and purgers of _what_ pre-existing poetic and legendary materials? Were
9391,APPENDIX B,"those materials the property of the ""Achaean or Northern"" conquerors,"
9392,APPENDIX B,"or of the pre-existing ""conquered races"" (to use Mr. Murray's terms);"
9393,APPENDIX B,or were the materials a medley derived from both sources? Were the
9394,APPENDIX B,"purgers Achaean poets working on materials, at least in part the"
9395,APPENDIX B,property of the conquered races? Or was the purgation mainly done by
9396,APPENDIX B,"Ionians, that is, by the mixed Greek peoples settled in Asia; peoples"
9397,APPENDIX B,certainly retaining many of the ideas of the conquered races which our
9398,APPENDIX B,"Homer ignores? Or did ""the Achaean or Northern spirit"" purge away some"
9399,APPENDIX B,"things distasteful to that spirit, while the Ionians purged away other"
9400,APPENDIX B,"things? What the elements more or less purged away are supposed to be,"
9401,APPENDIX B,we shall see later. In the passage to which I have referred[1] we find
9402,APPENDIX B,the following statements:--
9403,APPENDIX B,
9404,APPENDIX B,"""The epic tradition of Greece, vast and tangled in its wealth of varied"
9405,APPENDIX B,"beauty and ugliness, was left by the Homeric poets a much cleaner and"
9406,APPENDIX B,"colder thing than they found it. In the result, two influences were"
9407,APPENDIX B,"mainly at work. First, a general humanising of the imagination, the"
9408,APPENDIX B,"progress of a spirit which, as it loved beauty, hated cruelty and"
9409,APPENDIX B,"uncleanness. Secondly, a race prejudice. The relation of the Northern"
9410,APPENDIX B,"and the aboriginal elements in the Homeric poems are involved, when"
9411,APPENDIX B,"you come to details, in inextricable confusion, but in general the"
9412,APPENDIX B,'Homeric' tone of mind represents more of the Achaean or Northern
9413,APPENDIX B,spirit; the spirit of those scattered strong men who in their various
9414,APPENDIX B,settlements were leading and shaping the Aegean world. The special
9415,APPENDIX B,"myths, beliefs, and rites that were characteristic of the conquered"
9416,APPENDIX B,"races are pruned away or ignored; the hero-worship, the oracles, the"
9417,APPENDIX B,"magic and witchcraft, the hocus-pocus of purification, all that savours"
9418,APPENDIX B,"of 'the monstrous regiment of women, the uncanny prowess of dead men,"
9419,APPENDIX B,and the baleful confusion between man and God.'
9420,APPENDIX B,
9421,APPENDIX B,"Here I should absolutely agree with Mr. Murray, if I were convinced"
9422,APPENDIX B,"that ""the Northern or Achaean spirit"" of Achaean poets was dealing"
9423,APPENDIX B,"mainly with ""the epic tradition"" of præ-Achaean Greece. If they were,"
9424,APPENDIX B,"they would certainly ""ignore or prune away"" manners and beliefs which"
9425,APPENDIX B,"were not their own. But I have shown, I think, that between Achaean"
9426,APPENDIX B,"and Athenian early ""Saga"" a great gulf was fixed in Homeric times."
9427,APPENDIX B,"The Homeric poet dealt with Achaean legend, which could not contain"
9428,APPENDIX B,"ghost-worship, ""hocus-pocus of purification,"" and so on. Let me here"
9429,APPENDIX B,"remark that no known later Greek taste objected to the _märchenhaft_,"
9430,APPENDIX B,"the preposterous element in ""Saga."" Pindar and the dramatists do not"
9431,APPENDIX B,"reject it, I have shown, but Homer does in the _Iliad_. Had Homer"
9432,APPENDIX B,"revelled in it, later Greek taste saw nothing out of keeping here; had"
9433,APPENDIX B,"no temptation to expurgate Pegasus, or the soul-box of Meleager, or the"
9434,APPENDIX B,"magical invulnerability of Achilles, or his medicinal spear, or that"
9435,APPENDIX B,"magical property, the Luck of Troy, the palladium, and so forth. The"
9436,APPENDIX B,"genius of Homer, not later expurgation, accounts for his reticence."
9437,APPENDIX B,
9438,APPENDIX B,"Next, I seem to discern that ""the progress of a spirit which hated"
9439,APPENDIX B,"cruelty and uncleanness"" refers to a period when ""Achaeans"" and"
9440,APPENDIX B,"""Pelasgians,"" long intermingled, were becoming what is called"
9441,APPENDIX B,"""Hellenic,"" the people of early historic Greece in the sixth century."
9442,APPENDIX B,"What this Hellenic spirit might, if it could, purge away is just the"
9443,APPENDIX B,"ferocity which is _not_ purged away; the ferocity which mutilates, and,"
9444,APPENDIX B,"when the deed is not executed, has threatened to mutilate foes slain in"
9445,APPENDIX B,"open fight; and which denies, or wishes to deny, honourable burial to"
9446,APPENDIX B,"the dead. On the dead ""unseemly things"" are wrought, with little or no"
9447,APPENDIX B,"rebuke from the poet, except in the case of the extreme ferocities of"
9448,APPENDIX B,Achilles against Hector and the twelve Trojan captives. Thus Agamemnon
9449,APPENDIX B,"""smote Hippolochus to earth, and cut off his arms and neck with the"
9450,APPENDIX B,"sword, then tossed him like a ball of stone to roll through the"
9451,APPENDIX B,"throng""; or rather ""like the trunk of a tree.""[2] In the same way the"
9452,APPENDIX B,"minor Aias cuts off the head of Imbrios, and throws it like a football"
9453,APPENDIX B,"""into the scrum.""[3] Hector is keen to cut off the head of Patroclus,"
9454,APPENDIX B,"and stick it on a stake, like the head of the great Montrose.[4]"
9455,APPENDIX B,"Peneleus decapitates Ilioneus, and waves the head at the Trojans.[5]"
9456,APPENDIX B,
9457,APPENDIX B,Manifestly these ferocities were _de bonne guerre_ in the society to
9458,APPENDIX B,which Homer sang. I conceive that they were hateful to the taste of the
9459,APPENDIX B,historic Hellenic spirit. Could it have expurgated these ferocities it
9460,APPENDIX B,would have done so. But it could not. Other examples might be given.
9461,APPENDIX B,"Thus Euphorbus,[6] who dealt the first wound to Patroclus, threatens"
9462,APPENDIX B,to cut off and carry home the head of Menelaus. Euphorbus was avenging
9463,APPENDIX B,"his brother, slain by Menelaus. Peneleus was avenging Antimachus, his"
9464,APPENDIX B,friend. The ferocities are sometimes prompted by personal vengeance.
9465,APPENDIX B,"Euphorbus would have kept his word, but the spear of Menelaus pierced"
9466,APPENDIX B,his throat. We cannot find expurgation in failure to accomplish a
9467,APPENDIX B,"purpose. Hector meant to fix the head of Patroclus on a stake, so Iris"
9468,APPENDIX B,"tells Achilles,[7] and to give his body to the dogs to devour. Such was"
9469,APPENDIX B,"warfare as known to Homer; and the intellect of later Greece, which"
9470,APPENDIX B,"probably abhorred such deeds, expurgated nothing."
9471,APPENDIX B,
9472,APPENDIX B,"Mr. Murray writes[8] that ""no other corpse"" (except Hector's) ""is"
9473,APPENDIX B,"maltreated in the Iliad."" Such treatment was quite deliberately planned"
9474,APPENDIX B,"by men of both armies, and was also executed in hot blood. I have given"
9475,APPENDIX B,examples enough of such maltreatment.
9476,APPENDIX B,
9477,APPENDIX B,"To cruelty we return, and to refusal of burial. It seems to have been"
9478,APPENDIX B,quite usual. The notable exception in clemency is Achilles; before his
9479,APPENDIX B,"passion came on him he ransomed his captives, and ""his soul had shame"
9480,APPENDIX B,"to despoil the dead Eëtion""; but he burned him in his inlaid armour,"
9481,APPENDIX B,and raised a barrow over him.[9]
9482,APPENDIX B,
9483,APPENDIX B,"In the Iliad ferocity runs high, in these particulars; the historic"
9484,APPENDIX B,"hatred of such doings is growing but slowly. ""The spirit that"
9485,APPENDIX B,"hated cruelty"" has left the facts where it found them; there is no"
9486,APPENDIX B,expurgation of them. As to the Hellenic historic spirit and its
9487,APPENDIX B,"hatred of ""uncleanness""--_autres temps, autres moeurs_! Homer has no"
9488,APPENDIX B,"allusions to the survival of savage vices detested by ""the Northern"
9489,APPENDIX B,"spirit."" But, granting that the waxing spirit of Hellenism expurgated"
9490,APPENDIX B,atrocities committed on the dead (though they stand staring upon us
9491,APPENDIX B,"in the _Iliad_), ""the Northern or Achaean spirit"" is credited by Mr."
9492,APPENDIX B,"Murray with ""pruning away or ignoring"" the characteristic rites,"
9493,APPENDIX B,"beliefs, and usages of the conquered races."
9494,APPENDIX B,
9495,APPENDIX B,"The earlier the period, the more drastic would be the purification."
9496,APPENDIX B,"Achaeans, not yet leavened with ""Pelasgian"" blood and beliefs, could"
9497,APPENDIX B,not celebrate what they confessedly did not practise. In their work no
9498,APPENDIX B,later expurgation could cleanse away that which their work could not
9499,APPENDIX B,contain.
9500,APPENDIX B,
9501,APPENDIX B,Hero-worship; propitiation of the dead; purification of homicides by
9502,APPENDIX B,"blood; initiatory ceremonies, mysteries, witchcraft, and so forth,"
9503,APPENDIX B,"these are practices with which we are familiar in savagery, in"
9504,APPENDIX B,"barbarism, and, by way of survival, in the rites and customs of the"
9505,APPENDIX B,most highly civilised races. They exist in various degrees in different
9506,APPENDIX B,"races and societies. In Northern society, as we know it in the sagas,"
9507,APPENDIX B,most of these superstitions are comparatively rare. Ghosts were
9508,APPENDIX B,"believed in by Gunnar and Grettir; very able-bodied ghosts they were,"
9509,APPENDIX B,"a kind of vampires. But they were not propitiated, they were met with"
9510,APPENDIX B,"the steel axe and short sword, or with muscular force in the wrestling"
9511,APPENDIX B,"match. Their bodies were mutilated and then burned, as in the case of"
9512,APPENDIX B,the vampire Glam in the Grettir saga.
9513,APPENDIX B,
9514,APPENDIX B,"There are few, if any, traces of hero-worship in early Teutonic and"
9515,APPENDIX B,Scandinavian literature. Of purification from homicide in baths or by
9516,APPENDIX B,aspersions of swine's blood I can remember no Northern example.
9517,APPENDIX B,
9518,APPENDIX B,"The original purpose of this nasty practice is, apparently, to throw"
9519,APPENDIX B,the pursuing ghost of the slain man off the trail of the slayer; but
9520,APPENDIX B,the heroes of the Icelandic sagas recked not a fig for the feud of the
9521,APPENDIX B,"ghost. ""Soul and body, on the whole, are odds against a disembodied"
9522,APPENDIX B,"soul,"" in their opinion, hence the absence of the Greek rite of"
9523,APPENDIX B,purification by blood.
9524,APPENDIX B,
9525,APPENDIX B,"The Northerners had, doubtless, their various rustic rites and revels,"
9526,APPENDIX B,originally intended to promote the fertility of nature. But if they
9527,APPENDIX B,"once had initiatory ceremonies and mysteries like savages, these appear"
9528,APPENDIX B,to have been forgotten by the time of the heroes of the Icelandic
9529,APPENDIX B,"sagas. Witchcraft was an article of belief, but was held in great"
9530,APPENDIX B,"disesteem. There are legends of sacrifices of kings, but these are"
9531,APPENDIX B,somewhat shadowy and remote.
9532,APPENDIX B,
9533,APPENDIX B,"As a consequence, if the Teutonic and Scandinavian people had"
9534,APPENDIX B,"possessed a great epic poet, working in accordance with the ideas of"
9535,APPENDIX B,"his people as they existed at the time of the occupation of Iceland,"
9536,APPENDIX B,"his poem would, I conceive, be as silent as the Homeric epics about"
9537,APPENDIX B,"hero-worship, ghost-feeding, purification of homicides by blood,"
9538,APPENDIX B,"sacrifices of girls, initiatory ceremonies, and mysteries like those of"
9539,APPENDIX B,"Demeter and Dionysus. Of second-sight we would hear, as we do in the"
9540,APPENDIX B,"_Odyssey._ The magic would be worked by mortals, not by a fair goddess,"
9541,APPENDIX B,"Circe. Ravening monsters like Grendel and his mother, in _Beowulf_,"
9542,APPENDIX B,"with their refraction in the Grettir saga, and vampires like Glam,"
9543,APPENDIX B,would afford sport to the heroes; whereas in the _Iliad_ we have only
9544,APPENDIX B,"the Chimaera to represent such monsters, and the Chimaera is alluded to"
9545,APPENDIX B,but slightly.
9546,APPENDIX B,
9547,APPENDIX B,"Thus, as regards the whole chapter of the superstitions ""characteristic"
9548,APPENDIX B,"of the conquered races"" in Greece[10] (and characteristic of the"
9549,APPENDIX B,"historical Hellenes and of Athens in her lustre), the supposed"
9550,APPENDIX B,Scandinavian epic would be as pure as the _Iliad_. The absence of
9551,APPENDIX B,"mention of hero-worship, ghost-propitiation, divinised mortals,"
9552,APPENDIX B,"purification by blood, sacrifices of girls, initiations and mysteries,"
9553,APPENDIX B,would be quite natural and unaffected.
9554,APPENDIX B,
9555,APPENDIX B,The poet could not speak of beliefs and rites which were not in the
9556,APPENDIX B,"manners of his people. In the same way, and for the same reason, Homer"
9557,APPENDIX B,scarcely hints at anything in this chapter of superstitions and usages.
9558,APPENDIX B,"Like the Scandinavians of the heroic age, his people had not these"
9559,APPENDIX B,things in their manners.
9560,APPENDIX B,
9561,APPENDIX B,As the oldest Achaean poetry must necessarily have been pure from
9562,APPENDIX B,"the usages and beliefs of the conquered races, as the Achaean or"
9563,APPENDIX B,"Northern spirit ignored what, according to Mr. Murray, it actually"
9564,APPENDIX B,"persecuted,[11] we need not attribute this ignoring of such beliefs"
9565,APPENDIX B,"and practices to expurgation in a later age. The Ionians, as soon as"
9566,APPENDIX B,"we meet them in the dawn of actual history and in the ""Cyclic"" poems,"
9567,APPENDIX B,"are believers in ghosts, worshippers of heroes, and they practise"
9568,APPENDIX B,purification by blood. People do not expurgate from older poetry the
9569,APPENDIX B,things consecrated by their own law and religion and celebrated in
9570,APPENDIX B,"their own poems: things which could not be present, too, in the old"
9571,APPENDIX B,"poems of the uncontaminated Achaeans. Yet Mr. Murray appears, if I"
9572,APPENDIX B,"understand him, to incline to a theory that hero-worship, for example,"
9573,APPENDIX B,"was distasteful to the Ionian cult of the Delian Apollo, and perhaps"
9574,APPENDIX B,"for that reason was, in early historic times, expurgated from the"
9575,APPENDIX B,"_Iliad_. But certainly, given Homeric ideas about the dead, who could"
9576,APPENDIX B,"not help or hinder, hero-worship did not and could not exist in Homeric"
9577,APPENDIX B,"society and poetry. Moreover, if the Achaean spirit did ""prune away"
9578,APPENDIX B,"or ignore"" such ghostly matters, the Delian expurgators could find"
9579,APPENDIX B,"nothing here to expurgate. As to blood-purification, Apollo himself"
9580,APPENDIX B,"was purified, and, in art, holds the purifying pig above the homicide."
9581,APPENDIX B,"So purification was ""Apolline,"" and what was Apolline was safe from"
9582,APPENDIX B,Apolline expurgation.
9583,APPENDIX B,
9584,APPENDIX B,I now collect passages on the expurgators from Mr. Murray's writings.

9598,EXPURGATION,
9599,EXPURGATION,"So far the ""expurgations"" appear to have been done mainly by the"
9600,EXPURGATION,"Homeric poets themselves ""in the middle and later generations."" Yet, as"
9601,EXPURGATION,"to superstitions, the first uncontaminated Achaean poets must have been"
9602,EXPURGATION,the purest of all.
9603,EXPURGATION,
9604,EXPURGATION,"It is admitted that the poets did not in the same way ""expurgate"" the"

9611,EXPURGATION,
9612,EXPURGATION,"Here it appears that, probably by the eighth century, the _Iliad_"

9620,EXPURGATION,"(p. 245). If, then, it is really the austerity, and freedom from low"
9621,EXPURGATION,"superstitions, of the conquering Achaean race that our epics represent,"
9622,EXPURGATION,"the ""Cyclic"" poems, if equally old, should be equally austere, and"
9623,EXPURGATION,"equally free from superstition. But they, notoriously, were full of the"
9624,EXPURGATION,superstitions of the conquered races. Why did the middle generations
9625,EXPURGATION,of Homeric poems leave _them_ alone? Because already selected for
9626,EXPURGATION,recitation?
9627,EXPURGATION,
9628,EXPURGATION,"If the Achaean or Northern spirit, ""the clean and lordly Northern"

9633,EXPURGATION,It is plain enough that the clean and lordly Northern people became

9635,EXPURGATION,"the Cromwellian English settlers with the Irish. ""As the population"
9636,EXPURGATION,"became more mixed, which was the case everywhere on the mainland, the"
9637,EXPURGATION,"result was that the old pre-Hellenic stratum of beliefs and emotion,"
9638,EXPURGATION,"re-emerged"" (p. 246), for example, in worship of the dead, which is"
9639,EXPURGATION,un-Homeric and un-Achaean.
9640,EXPURGATION,
9641,EXPURGATION,"Are we to suppose, then, that while the Achaeans were sinking to the"
9642,EXPURGATION,"pre-Hellenic level in such matters, all the superstitions of the"
9643,EXPURGATION,"conquered races found their way into the Homeric poems, and had to be"
9644,EXPURGATION,"purged out again, in Delos, or at Athens, where these superstitions"
9645,EXPURGATION,"were in full force? If so, the descendants of the pre-Hellenic"
9646,EXPURGATION,populations inserted the superstitions into the _Iliad_ where they had
9647,EXPURGATION,"not been previously, and then cut them out again."
9648,EXPURGATION,
9649,EXPURGATION,"It is not easy to understand how stories ""far too primitive and"
9650,EXPURGATION,"monstrous for Homer"" ""had been expurgated from Homer centuries back"""
9651,EXPURGATION,"(p. 247), centuries before Aeschylus, who introduced Io, once the"
9652,EXPURGATION,"mistress of Zeus, later a cow, in his _Prometheus_. If Homer or the"

9654,EXPURGATION,"dealt at all in a story ""far too primitive and monstrous for Homer,"" or"
9655,EXPURGATION,for any one but Major Weir. It does not appear to me that this theory
9656,EXPURGATION,"of expurgation, all important as it is, can be easily understood. If"
9657,EXPURGATION,"later Greece expurgated the Homeric ferocities to the dead, why are"
9658,EXPURGATION,"they left standing? If the Achaean spirit got rid of the superstitions,"
9659,EXPURGATION,"why need we invoke later influences, Delian, Ionian, Athenian?"
9660,EXPURGATION,
9661,EXPURGATION,"Then the old questions re-arise, why were the ""Cyclic"" poems of the"
9662,EXPURGATION,heroic times left unexpurgated; why is the Attic drama tinged with what
9663,EXPURGATION,"is too monstrous for Homer, if Homer was purged a generation, or two"
9664,EXPURGATION,"or three, earlier than the generation of Aeschylus? To account for the"
9665,EXPURGATION,"expurgations, we are to consider the establishment by law of Homeric"
9666,EXPURGATION,"recitations at Athens (see ""The Alleged Athenian Recension of Homer"")."
9667,EXPURGATION,"Concerning the date of this event, and everything else connected with"
9668,EXPURGATION,"it, all is vague. Mr. Murray writes: ""The recitation was established"
9669,EXPURGATION,about the end of the sixth century ... so much seems historically
9670,EXPURGATION,"clear."" (I wish anything were historically clear in this business!)"
9671,EXPURGATION,"""It matters little that, in attributing the institution of this"
9672,EXPURGATION,"recitation to a definite founder, our authorities waver between three"
9673,EXPURGATION,"almost contemporaneous names, Solon, Pisistratus, Hipparchus. Whichever"
9674,EXPURGATION,"it was, the main fact remains the same. General considerations tell"
9675,EXPURGATION,"somewhat against Solon, and in favour of the tyrants."" Now, as our"
9676,EXPURGATION,"authorities, all late, differ totally as to the name (and so, as to the"
9677,EXPURGATION,"date) of the man who instituted the recitations of Homer, it is plain"
9678,EXPURGATION,"that they had no good authority. ""The Solonian laws and constitution"
9679,EXPURGATION,"were promulgated in 594 B.C.,"" says Grote; that was at least eighty"
9680,EXPURGATION,"years before a date ""about the end of the sixth century."" The men are"
9681,EXPURGATION,"far from being contemporaneous. Hipparchus was murdered in 514, in the"
9682,EXPURGATION,"thirteenth year of the tyranny of Hipparchus, and Hippias, if anybody,"
9683,EXPURGATION,"not Hipparchus, should have made a law regulating Homeric recitations."
9684,EXPURGATION,
9685,EXPURGATION,All is vague; but if Thucydides correctly says that Hipparchus was
9686,EXPURGATION,slain in consequence of a quarrel arising out of an odious non-Homeric
9687,EXPURGATION,"vice; and if, as Thucydides says, Aristogeiton died ""not easily,"" if"
9688,EXPURGATION,"he was tortured to death, as later authors tell, then the society of"
9689,EXPURGATION,"Athens was little likely to expurgate either uncleanness or cruelty, if"
9690,EXPURGATION,they found such matter in Homer.
9691,EXPURGATION,
9692,EXPURGATION,Political and personal history being so vague and dim in the sixth
9693,EXPURGATION,"century, literary history cannot be in better case; practically we know"
9694,EXPURGATION,nothing beyond the fact that a law regulated the recitation of Homer at
9695,EXPURGATION,the Panathenaic festival.
9696,EXPURGATION,
9697,EXPURGATION,How these recitations and hypothetical earlier Ionian recitations
9698,EXPURGATION,"contributed to the expurgation of the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_, must be"
9699,EXPURGATION,"stated in Mr. Murray's own words. I may first observe that, in his"
9700,EXPURGATION,"opinion, ""the body of the poem"" (the _Iliad_), ""even in the latest"
9701,EXPURGATION,"parts, is clearly Ionian; the ultimate nucleus something else,"
9702,EXPURGATION,"something older and more Northern.""[12] How, if this be true, the"
9703,EXPURGATION,"Ionians are only once named in the poems, while the Athenians are but"
9704,EXPURGATION,"perfunctorily mentioned, is what always puzzles me!"
9705,EXPURGATION,
9706,EXPURGATION,A long extract in which Mr. Murray gives his views must now be quoted:
9707,EXPURGATION,
9708,EXPURGATION,"""In the remains of the earliest Greek poetry we are met by a"
9709,EXPURGATION,"striking contrast. As Mr. Lang has told us, 'Homer presents to the"
9710,EXPURGATION,anthropologist the spectacle of a society which will have nothing to
9711,EXPURGATION,"do with anthropology.' By Homer, of course, Mr. Lang means the _Iliad_"
9712,EXPURGATION,and the _Odyssey_; and we may add to those poems a stream of heroic
9713,EXPURGATION,tradition which runs more or less clearly through most of our later
9714,EXPURGATION,"literature, and whose spirit is what we call classic, Homeric, or"
9715,EXPURGATION,Olympian.
9716,EXPURGATION,
9717,EXPURGATION,"""But there is also in the earliest epic tradition another stratum,"
9718,EXPURGATION,of which this Olympian character does not hold. A stratum full of
9719,EXPURGATION,"the remains, and at times even betraying the actuality, of those"
9720,EXPURGATION,'beastly devices of the heathen' which are dear to the heart of
9721,EXPURGATION,us anthropologists--if a mere Greek scholar may venture to class
9722,EXPURGATION,himself among even amateur anthropologists; ceremonies of magic
9723,EXPURGATION,"and purification, beast-worship, stone-xvorship, ghosts, and"
9724,EXPURGATION,"anthropomorphic (theriomorphic?) gods, traces of the peculiar powers"
9725,EXPURGATION,"of women both as 'good medicine' and as titular heads of the family,"
9726,EXPURGATION,and especially a most pervading and almost ubiquitous memory of Human
9727,EXPURGATION,Sacrifice.
9728,EXPURGATION,
9729,EXPURGATION,"""This stratum is represented by Hesiod and the Rejected Epics,--I mean"
9730,EXPURGATION,those products of the primitive saga-poetry which were not selected for
9731,EXPURGATION,recitation at the Panathenaea (or the unknown Ionian archetype of the
9732,EXPURGATION,"Panathenaea), and which consequently fell into neglect,--by the Orphic"
9733,EXPURGATION,"literature, by a large element in tragedy, most richly, perhaps, by"
9734,EXPURGATION,"the antiquarian traditions preserved in Pausanias, and in the hostile"
9735,EXPURGATION,"comments of certain Christian writers, such as Clement and Eusebius."
9736,EXPURGATION,
9737,EXPURGATION,"""Now the first thing for the historian to observe about this"
9738,EXPURGATION,non-Homeric stratum is this: that non-Homeric is by no means the same
9739,EXPURGATION,thing as post-Homeric. We used to be taught that it was. We used to be
9740,EXPURGATION,"taught that Homer was, practically speaking, primitive: that we started"
9741,EXPURGATION,from a pure epic atmosphere and then passed into an age of romantic
9742,EXPURGATION,degradation. The extant remains of the non-Homeric poems frequently
9743,EXPURGATION,"show in their form, and sometimes even in their content, definite"
9744,EXPURGATION,"signs of presupposing the _Iliad_, just as the _Iliad_ here and there"
9745,EXPURGATION,shows signs of presupposing them; and it is not until recently that
9746,EXPURGATION,we have been able to understand properly the nature and the method of
9747,EXPURGATION,composition of an ancient Traditional Book. I will not go into that
9748,EXPURGATION,"point in detail here. Even supposing that the _Cypria,_ as a poem,"
9749,EXPURGATION,"could definitely be called 'later' than the _Iliad_, it is enough to"
9750,EXPURGATION,say that a later literary whole may often contain an older kernel or
9751,EXPURGATION,"a more primitive mass of material, and in the case of the non-Homeric"
9752,EXPURGATION,saga-poems it is fairly clear that they do so.
9753,EXPURGATION,
9754,EXPURGATION,"""Two arguments will suffice: First, the argument from analogy. Few"
9755,EXPURGATION,"anthropologists, with the knowledge now at our command, will regard the"
9756,EXPURGATION,"high, austere, knightly atmosphere of the _Iliad_ as primitive when"
9757,EXPURGATION,"compared with that of Hesiod. In the second place, a great proportion"
9758,EXPURGATION,of our anthropological material is already to be found in prehistoric
9759,EXPURGATION,"Crete. The an-iconic worship, the stones, the beasts, the pillars, and"
9760,EXPURGATION,"the ouranian birds; the great mother goddess of Anatolia, the human"
9761,EXPURGATION,"sacrifices, and the royal and divine bull. I speak under correction"
9762,EXPURGATION,from those who know the Cretan finds better than I; but to me it seems
9763,EXPURGATION,that there are many bridges visible from Crete to Hesiod or Eumelus or
9764,EXPURGATION,"even Pausanias; but the gulf between Crete and Homer seems, in certain"
9765,EXPURGATION,"places, to have no bridge."
9766,EXPURGATION,
9767,EXPURGATION,"""Thus the later literary whole contains the more primitive modes of"
9768,EXPURGATION,"thought, the earlier religion."
9769,EXPURGATION,
9770,EXPURGATION,"""Now this fact in itself, though it may be stated in different ways, is"
9771,EXPURGATION,not much disputed among scholars. But the explanations of the fact are
9772,EXPURGATION,various. That which seems to me much the most probable is the theory
9773,EXPURGATION,of Expurgation. As Mr. Lang seems not quite to have understood what I
9774,EXPURGATION,"tried to say about this in my _Rise of the Greek Epic_, I will restate"
9775,EXPURGATION,it in this way: We know that the great mass of saga-poetry began to
9776,EXPURGATION,be left on one side and neglected from about the eighth century on;
9777,EXPURGATION,"and we find, to judge from our fragments, that it remained in its"
9778,EXPURGATION,"semi-savage state. Two poems, on the contrary, were selected at some"
9779,EXPURGATION,early time for public recitation at the solemn four-yearly meeting of
9780,EXPURGATION,"""all Ionians,""[13] and afterwards of ""all Athenians."" The poems were"
9781,EXPURGATION,demonstrably still in a fluid condition; and the intellect of Greece
9782,EXPURGATION,was focussed upon them. This process lasted on through the period
9783,EXPURGATION,of that great movement which raised the shores of the Aegean from a
9784,EXPURGATION,"land of semi-savages to the Hellas of Thales, of Aeschylus, and of"
9785,EXPURGATION,"Euripides. And we find, naturally, that amid all the colour of an ideal"
9786,EXPURGATION,"past, in which these two epics, like all other epics, have steeped"
9787,EXPURGATION,"their story, there has been a gradual but drastic rejection of all the"
9788,EXPURGATION,uglier and uncleaner elements. That is a very broad statement; it omits
9789,EXPURGATION,both the evidence and the additional causes and qualifications. But it
9790,EXPURGATION,serves to explain why I treat the non-Homeric sagas as representing
9791,EXPURGATION,"more faithfully the primitive pre-Hellenic habits of thought, the mere"
9792,EXPURGATION,"slough out of which Hellas rose."""
9793,EXPURGATION,
9794,EXPURGATION,*       *       *       *       *
9795,EXPURGATION,
9796,EXPURGATION,"I agree that the ""non-Homeric sagas"" represent more faithfully the"
9797,EXPURGATION,primitive pre-Hellenic habits of thought. Homer was not concerned
9798,EXPURGATION,with pre-Hellenic habits of thought; he represents the Hellenes who
9799,EXPURGATION,"""possessed Hellas, the land of fair women, and followed Achilles."""
9800,EXPURGATION,
9801,EXPURGATION,"I also entirely agree that ""the later literary whole"" (by which I at"
9802,EXPURGATION,"least mean Hesiod, the ""Cyclic"" fragment, and much of Greek tragedy,"
9803,EXPURGATION,"not to speak of antiquarian learning) ""contains the more primitive"
9804,EXPURGATION,"modes of thought, the earlier religion."" But the theory that these"
9805,EXPURGATION,"things were once in, but were purged out of, the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey,_"
9806,EXPURGATION,"still baffles me. If they were usages peculiar to the conquered races,"
9807,EXPURGATION,how could they appear in the poetry of the uncontaminated Northern or
9808,EXPURGATION,Achaean conquerors?
9809,EXPURGATION,
9810,EXPURGATION,"How, again, can we say that ""the great mass of saga poetry began to"
9811,EXPURGATION,"be left on one side and neglected from about the eighth century""?"
9812,EXPURGATION,"Notoriously the ""Cyclic"" poems, or the legends which were given in"
9813,EXPURGATION,"those poems, were greatly preferred as subjects of art by the Athenian"
9814,EXPURGATION,"vase-painters of the sixth century, and by Polygnotus when he decorated"
9815,EXPURGATION,"the Lesche at Delphi. The stories, I have shown, reached the Middle"
9816,EXPURGATION,"Ages through Rome and through Graeco-Roman literature, and eclipsed our"
9817,EXPURGATION,Homer. To them we owe the unhappy _Troilus and Cressida_ of Shakespeare.
9818,EXPURGATION,
9819,EXPURGATION,"We have no evidence known to me that proves the selection, ""at some"
9820,EXPURGATION,"early time for public recitation,"" of ""two poems,"" at the solemn"
9821,EXPURGATION,"four-yearly meeting of ""All Ionians"" and afterwards of ""all Athenians."""
9822,EXPURGATION,"Mr. Verrall supposes the ""Cyclic"" poems, as well as our Homer, to have"
9823,EXPURGATION,"been recited at the Panathenaea. I know no evidence that they were, and"
9824,EXPURGATION,none proving that they were not. I am unaware of any reason for which
9825,EXPURGATION,our _Iliad_ should have been specially selected for education in the
9826,EXPURGATION,"Ionia of the eighth century, and for public recitation. The reason is"
9827,EXPURGATION,"the further to seek if the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_, when thus selected,"
9828,EXPURGATION,"""were demonstrably still in a fluid condition""; indeed, while they were"
9829,EXPURGATION,"still in a fluid condition, I do not know how they could have been"
9830,EXPURGATION,deemed so much more choiceworthy than other poems still (I presume)
9831,EXPURGATION,fluidic.
9832,EXPURGATION,
9833,EXPURGATION,"If ""the intellect of Greece was focussed upon"" _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_"
9834,EXPURGATION,"while they were still fluidic, but already selected, then the"
9835,EXPURGATION,"expurgation was due, not to Achaean poets who ignored and pruned"
9836,EXPURGATION,"away the usages and beliefs of the conquered races, but to _les"
9837,EXPURGATION,"intellectuels_ of Greece, who (whatever their private opinions might"
9838,EXPURGATION,be) saw hero-worship in daily practice; and if they killed any
9839,EXPURGATION,"one, were purified by pigs' blood. Hesiod stood high in universal"
9840,EXPURGATION,"knowledge, was a consecrated authority; if he could be purged, why"
9841,EXPURGATION,was he not purged? Because he was not recited? Yet he was part of
9842,EXPURGATION,"education, and needed a Bowdler much more than Homer."
9843,EXPURGATION,
9844,EXPURGATION,"The practices and beliefs expurgated from Homer were not ""done in a"
9845,EXPURGATION,"corner"" in historic Greece."
9846,EXPURGATION,
9847,EXPURGATION,"So ""primitive,"" so barbaric was the intellect of historic Greece even"
9848,EXPURGATION,"in the sixth century and in the age of Pericles, and later, in regard"
9849,EXPURGATION,"to heroic tombs, for example, that the heroic ghosts were supposed to"
9850,EXPURGATION,"inhabit their sepulchres in the shape of rather harmless snakes, like"
9851,EXPURGATION,"the _Idhlozi_ of the Zulus. ""In Snake form the hero dwelt in his tomb,"""
9852,EXPURGATION,says Miss Harrison.[14]
9853,EXPURGATION,
9854,EXPURGATION,Miss Harrison publishes reproductions of works of Greek art from
9855,EXPURGATION,"the sixth century (when all ugly things of this kind, we are told,"
9856,EXPURGATION,were drastically rejected from the _Odyssey_ and _Iliad_) to the
9857,EXPURGATION,"fourth century. We see the dead, a male and a female ghost, receiving"
9858,EXPURGATION,offerings. The artist is determined to make his meaning clear. Behind
9859,EXPURGATION,the chairs of the holy heroes is a huge snake with a man's beard. He is
9860,EXPURGATION,"a _human_ snake, the incarnation of the dead man's ghost. This is the"
9861,EXPURGATION,belief of the Baronga of Delagoa and of the Zulus.[15]
9862,EXPURGATION,
9863,EXPURGATION,"In a vase, a _lecythus_, of the fifth century, the worshippers surround"
9864,EXPURGATION,a tumulus with a phallus-shaped pillar on top. A huge snake occupies
9865,EXPURGATION,the tumulus; he is the ghost's incarnation.[16]
9866,EXPURGATION,
9867,EXPURGATION,"Not in glens of mountainous Arcadia, or in recesses of rural chapels"
9868,EXPURGATION,"alone, were these things done. The theatre showed sacred tombs; each"
9869,EXPURGATION,place of periodical games had its presiding hero; relics were in high
9870,EXPURGATION,"request, living men, conquerors or athletes, came to be divinised; at"
9871,EXPURGATION,the Eleusinia the initiates saw rites of savage origin; oracles of the
9872,EXPURGATION,dead were publicly consulted; the purification rites went on as law
9873,EXPURGATION,"demanded--all publicly, all unrebuked."
9874,EXPURGATION,
9875,EXPURGATION,Does any one suppose that priapic images like those of the Admiralty
9876,EXPURGATION,Islands were features in Homer's conception of a street in Mycenae or
9877,EXPURGATION,"Ilios? These images were sacred in the Athens of Pericles, the Hermae"
9878,EXPURGATION,"were not like Homer's Hermes. Is it likely that, if the managers of"
9879,EXPURGATION,"Delian or Athenian recitations found such things as these in Homer,"
9880,EXPURGATION,"they would cut them out as too naughty to be mentioned, or for some"
9881,EXPURGATION,"other reason not to be mentioned, at a public festival of men and women"
9882,EXPURGATION,"familiar with all these things, and seeing in them nothing but good?"
9883,EXPURGATION,
9884,EXPURGATION,"It seems unlikely. Moreover, if the Northern or Achaean spirit had"
9885,EXPURGATION,"ignored or pruned away these things, they could give no trouble to the"
9886,EXPURGATION,managers of Delian or Athenian recitations.
9887,EXPURGATION,
9888,EXPURGATION,"When we come to consider examples of expurgation, we may prefer to pass"
9889,EXPURGATION,"by the odious vices reprobated by the code of Australian savages, but"
9890,EXPURGATION,"highly popular in historic Greece. They do not occur in our Homer, and"
9891,EXPURGATION,"I know but one allusion to them in the Icelandic sagas, and that is in"
9892,EXPURGATION,a mere impossible taunt about a Bogle. But no one can say that Homer
9893,EXPURGATION,"never heard of such things; we might as well say that, because nobody"
9894,EXPURGATION,"coughs in Homer, no Achaean ever condescended to cough. The profession"
9895,EXPURGATION,"of Rahab cannot have been unknown, though Homer never mentions it. In"
9896,EXPURGATION,"short, a high ideal tone is preserved, Homer is not Monsieur Zola; an"
9897,EXPURGATION,"epic is not a ""naturalistic"" novel."
9898,EXPURGATION,
9899,EXPURGATION,"When the Greeks did entertain a moral objection to anything, to"
9900,EXPURGATION,"adelphic marriage, for example: if Homer mentioned such an union, among"
9901,EXPURGATION,"the Phaeacians, I can easily believe that a palliative explanation"
9902,EXPURGATION,"might be later inserted. Thus, in _Odyssey_, vii. 54, Alcinous and"
9903,EXPURGATION,"Arete are ""of the self-same parents."" Later, a genealogy makes them"
9904,EXPURGATION,"uncle and niece. This, for what I know, may be a later palliative"
9905,EXPURGATION,interpolation. But it is all one to Homer. He follows a well-known
9906,EXPURGATION,"_Märchen,_ a tale of No Man's Land, as in his mention of the adelphic"
9907,EXPURGATION,marriages of the sons and daughters of Aeolus. Adelphic unions are
9908,EXPURGATION,capital offences in savage customary law; one has no reason to suppose
9909,EXPURGATION,"that the Homeric Achaeans were more lax than savages, or no less"
9910,EXPURGATION,depraved by Egyptian influences than the Ptolemy and Berenice of
9911,EXPURGATION,Theocritus.[17]
9912,EXPURGATION,
9913,EXPURGATION,I am following Mr. Murray's examples of expurgation. The spirit of the
9914,EXPURGATION,"battles in the _Iliad_ ""is chivalrous,"" he says. ""No enemy is ever"
9915,EXPURGATION,"tortured"" (as Sinon is in Quintus Smyrnaeus). Yet mediæval professors"
9916,EXPURGATION,"of chivalry never mutilated, I think, foes (not being rebels) slain in"
9917,EXPURGATION,"fair field. Homer's men did, I have shown; and nobody expurgated the"
9918,EXPURGATION,"melancholy facts. As to cruelty to living foes, Euripides and Sophocles"
9919,EXPURGATION,"make Achilles drag the living Hector behind his chariot, while Homer"
9920,EXPURGATION,makes it plain that Hector is stone dead.[18]
9921,EXPURGATION,
9922,EXPURGATION,One can only say that Homer shows better taste than the tragedians.
9923,EXPURGATION,"If this good taste is due to late expurgators, if, in a Homeric lay,"
9924,EXPURGATION,"Achilles did drag the living Hector, one can only wish that Sophocles"
9925,EXPURGATION,and Euripides had been on the moral level of the expurgators. Whoever
9926,EXPURGATION,"_they_ were, their taste was vastly superior to that of the tragedians."
9927,EXPURGATION,I would attribute the better taste to Homer. The odious tale may be
9928,EXPURGATION,of Ionian invention: the Ionian poet makes Odysseus a child murderer.
9929,EXPURGATION,"In the _Tain Bo Cualgne_, Ferdiad drags a very odious dead man at his"
9930,EXPURGATION,"chariot wheels, not a living man. Homer was probably, indeed certainly,"
9931,EXPURGATION,on a higher level of taste than the ancient Irish epic-makers: on
9932,EXPURGATION,this point they are at one with him. The great tragedians preferred
9933,EXPURGATION,"a more horrible story--not, of course, because they approved of such"
9934,EXPURGATION,"proceedings. In King Lear, Shakespeare has horrors undreamed of in his"
9935,EXPURGATION,"sources, in _Märchen_ and chronicles. He followed a French story in"
9936,EXPURGATION,"Sidney's _Arcadia_, and pleased ""the groundlings."" To ""groundlings"""
9937,EXPURGATION,Homer did not sing: Sophocles and Euripides wrote for the cultured Pit
9938,EXPURGATION,"of Athens. For that reason, or because they found their story in some"
9939,EXPURGATION,"unknown source, and liked the horrible, they made Achilles torture a"
9940,EXPURGATION,living enemy.
9941,EXPURGATION,
9942,EXPURGATION,"There is a passage in the _Iliad_ (xiii. 573) in which a man, speared"
9943,EXPURGATION,"from behind through the bowels, ""where a wound is most baneful to"
9944,EXPURGATION,"wretched mortals, writhes about the spear ... for a moment, not for"
9945,EXPURGATION,"long""; his life follows the spear withdrawn. This is not a pleasant"
9946,EXPURGATION,"picture; but war, in fact, is not pleasant. Mr. Murray conceives the"
9947,EXPURGATION,"line which he renders ""he struggled quite a little while, not at all"
9948,EXPURGATION,"long,"" to be a later palliative or expurgative addition; like the"
9949,EXPURGATION,"same formula in Odyssey, xxii. 473, where it is applied to the dying"
9950,EXPURGATION,"struggles of the hanged women-servants of Odysseus. This may be so,"
9951,EXPURGATION,"or may not; the fact that the line _is_ a formula, like those of our"
9952,EXPURGATION,"ballads, makes me incline to think it ancient. The point is not of"
9953,EXPURGATION,"much importance, and cannot be decided. The horrible death inflicted on"
9954,EXPURGATION,"the treacherous thrall, Melanthius, in the _Odyssey_, is a proof that"
9955,EXPURGATION,Homer's men could be very cruel to a treacherous thrall; but so could
9956,EXPURGATION,"the Norsemen be, as in the scarcely quotable parallel case of Wolf the"
9957,EXPURGATION,"Unwashed. In the sagas generally we hear of few such cases, though many"
9958,EXPURGATION,"must have occurred, abroad, in Viking raids. In the _Iliad_ there is"
9959,EXPURGATION,"no treacherous thrall; if such an one there were, he would have been"
9960,EXPURGATION,treated like Melanthius.
9961,EXPURGATION,
9962,EXPURGATION,"I understand Mr. Murray to argue that the _Iliad_ has been expurgated,"
9963,EXPURGATION,"but not quite successfully, of traces of poisoned arrows; while"
9964,EXPURGATION,the _Odyssey_ (l. 257-264) has the story of Odysseus seeking for
9965,EXPURGATION,"arrow-poison at Ephyre, where poison was, we elsewhere learn, a"
9966,EXPURGATION,"marketable commodity. Ilus would not give it, for he feared the"
9967,EXPURGATION,"gods; another man gave it, as he dearly loved Odysseus. The story is"
9968,EXPURGATION,"not a true story, but a fable told by Athene. All it proves is that"
9969,EXPURGATION,"arrow-poison was known, but was hateful to the gods. As to Mr. Murray's"
9970,EXPURGATION,"arguments that such words as [Greek: _aphuktos_], not ""to be escaped,"""
9971,EXPURGATION,"applied to arrows in the _Iliad_, and ""bitter"" ([Greek: pikros]) and"
9972,EXPURGATION,"""groanful"" and ""not long to be supported"" as proofs of the practice"
9973,EXPURGATION,"of poisoning arrows, I can only say that I do not think the inference"
9974,EXPURGATION,"necessary. [Greek: _Pikros_] means ""sharp,"" according to Liddell and"
9975,EXPURGATION,"Scott; unpoisoned arrows cause groans enough; the heroes ""do not long"
9976,EXPURGATION,"support"" flesh-wounds from _spears_, but ""retire hurt."" That Agamemnon"
9977,EXPURGATION,"expects Menelaus to die (iv. 134) when arrow--smitten in the belly,"
9978,EXPURGATION,"is very natural. Menelaus would have died had the arrow bitten deep,"
9979,EXPURGATION,but it merely grazed him through several interstices of his armour.
9980,EXPURGATION,"Pandarus shot with a fresh arrow, ""unused before,"" ""whose poison has"
9981,EXPURGATION,"not been rubbed off."" I reply that in meditating an important shot, any"
9982,EXPURGATION,"archer would use a fresh arrow if he could, because the feathers would"
9983,EXPURGATION,"have been in better trim and the shaft unstrained, the point unblunted,"
9984,EXPURGATION,exactly as a man would use a new spear in a tournament.
9985,EXPURGATION,
9986,EXPURGATION,"In the _Iliad_, men have strong bows, with iron or bronze points."
9987,EXPURGATION,"People with these advantages do not use arrow-poison, the resort of"
9988,EXPURGATION,"races with blow-pipes, or with weak bows and arrow-points of bone,"
9989,EXPURGATION,corrupt human bones by preference.
9990,EXPURGATION,
9991,EXPURGATION,"As to human sacrifice, a frequent topic in the Cyclic poems and the"
9992,EXPURGATION,"Greek dramatists, I have treated the subject elsewhere. I do not think"
9993,EXPURGATION,that it was expurgated from the _Iliad_ by men who let it stand in the
9994,EXPURGATION,"Cyclic poems and the drama, but that it was not in Achaean manners. In"
9995,EXPURGATION,"the legends told of human sacrifice by Pausanias, the peoples concerned"
9996,EXPURGATION,"are usually Ionian or Athenian. The timid Calchas of _Iliad_, i. 74-83,"
9997,EXPURGATION,who dare not name the cause of Apollo's wrath unless Achilles will
9998,EXPURGATION,"guarantee his safety, could never have bidden Agamemnon to sacrifice"
9999,EXPURGATION,"his daughter Iphigeneia, who is not one of the Over Lord's three"
10000,EXPURGATION,"daughters, in the Iliad."
10001,EXPURGATION,
10002,EXPURGATION,"Mr. Murray suspects that stories of sacrifices of maidens ""would have"
10003,EXPURGATION,"been rejected from the _Iliad_, not only because human sacrifice was"
10004,EXPURGATION,"a barbarity, but also because the stories involved too intense an"
10005,EXPURGATION,"interest in women.""[19] As I am intensely interested in Helen, Hecuba"
10006,EXPURGATION,"and Andromache, in the Iliad, the argument seems to me strange. As to"
10007,EXPURGATION,Mr. Murray's theory that the Cretan king was done to death at stated
10008,EXPURGATION,"intervals,[20] the topic cannot be treated satisfactorily here. I do"
10009,EXPURGATION,"not believe that anything of the sort described occurred anywhere,"
10010,EXPURGATION,"and I am surprised at the remark, ""We have no tradition of Minos's"
10011,EXPURGATION,"death.""[21]"
10012,EXPURGATION,
10013,EXPURGATION,The Minyan story of the intended sacrifice of Phryxus and Helle is
10014,EXPURGATION,"a world-wide _Märchen_, with sacrifice substituted for endophagous"
10015,EXPURGATION,cannibalism.
10016,EXPURGATION,
10017,EXPURGATION,"Finally, I do not suppose that the ferocities of Achilles towards"
10018,EXPURGATION,"Hector, and at the funeral of Patroclus, are an expurgated version of"
10019,EXPURGATION,a lay in which they were narrated with pride and pleasure.[22] It was
10020,EXPURGATION,"customary, in Homeric warfare, to maltreat the dead; but Achilles went"
10021,EXPURGATION,"too far, and persevered too long. He is, as Mr. Murray says, ""a man mad"
10022,EXPURGATION,"with grief, a man starving and sleepless,"" a man who knows that Hector"
10023,EXPURGATION,intended to mutilate his friend and give his body to the dogs. But
10024,EXPURGATION,"these excuses do not palliate the perseverance of Achilles in outrage,"
10025,EXPURGATION,or his slaying of the twelve Trojan captives. Sacrificed they were not.
10026,EXPURGATION,"There was no ritual for such a slaughter, 'and, as a matter of fact, it"
10027,EXPURGATION,is crowded into a shamefaced line and a half.' You would expect this
10028,EXPURGATION,"sacrifice to have at the very least twenty.""[23]"
10029,EXPURGATION,
10030,EXPURGATION,"You might expect that, if you believed that the Achaeans had a ritual"
10031,EXPURGATION,"for human sacrifice! If they had, which I deem inconceivable, we"
10032,EXPURGATION,may readily believe that the spirit of historic Hellas would have
10033,EXPURGATION,expurgated eighteen and a half of the twenty lines.
10034,EXPURGATION,
10035,EXPURGATION,Much of this theory of expurgation of the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ seems
10036,EXPURGATION,to me to rest on the assumption of [Greek: euphêmia]. This means
10037,EXPURGATION,abstention from ill-omened words in poems recited at a great public
10038,EXPURGATION,"festival. It is impossible for me to understand why words referring,"
10039,EXPURGATION,"for example, to the habitual and legal purification of homicides, or"
10040,EXPURGATION,"to the established cult of heroes, should be deemed ""ill-omened"" at"
10041,EXPURGATION,"the recitations, in no way religious, at a public holiday, and yet be"
10042,EXPURGATION,"deemed ""well-omened"" in the performances of Athenian tragedy."
10043,EXPURGATION,
10044,EXPURGATION,If the superstitions of the conquered races were not those of the
10045,EXPURGATION,"conquerors, they could not be in the epics of the conquerors. If they"
10046,EXPURGATION,"were not there, _les intellectuels_ of Athens could not expurgate them."

10113,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"no record--that is, no contemporary public inscription--testifying"

10117,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"the following century, Herodotus and Thucydides, none in Aristotle,"
10118,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"none in Ephorus (in the fourth century B.C.), none in the remains of"
10119,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,Aristarchus and other famous Alexandrian grammarians. History is silent
10120,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"even as to a rumour. We know that Dieuchidas, a Megarian historian of"
10121,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"the fourth century, said something about its being Solon rather than"
10122,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,Pisistratus who did something in connection with Homer. We know this
10123,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"from a mutilated passage in an author of the third century, Diogenes"
10124,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,Laertius. That is all.[2] Tradition from the time of Pisistratus

10132,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10133,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"Cicero speaks only of what ""is said."" The unvouched for report"
10134,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,mentioned by Cicero half a milennium after the date of Pisistratus is
10135,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"not history, of course; is not evidence. Long before Cicero, in the"
10136,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"fourth century, Ephorus and Heraclides Ponticus told other stories"
10137,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"about the coming of Homer to Sparta, stories equally unhistorical. The"
10138,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"author of the pseudo-Platonic dialogue, _Hipparchus_, represented the"
10139,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"second son of Pisistratus as the first to bring Homer to Attica, and to"
10140,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"regulate Homeric recitations. None of these writers stands for History,"
10141,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,none of them agrees with another; they had no historical knowledge of
10142,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,whatever facts there may have been.
10143,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10144,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,We are in presence (1) of variants of a tradition doubtless founded
10145,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"on fact, namely, that at an unknown date an Act was passed in Athens"
10146,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,regulating the recitations of Homeric poetry at the Panathenaic
10147,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"festival; by some accounts an Act limiting the recitations to ""Homeric"""
10148,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"poetry alone; and (2) of a legend that Pisistratus, or his second"
10149,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"son, collected and arranged in a certain order the Homeric poems. The"
10150,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"earliest and only good evidence, says Mr. Monro, with regard to the"
10151,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"recitation of Homer at Athens, is that of two orators two centuries"
10152,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"later than Pisistratus, Lycurgus and Isocrates. The former said in"
10153,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"a speech ""Our fathers thought Homer such a good poet that they made"
10154,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,a law for him alone among poets that his poems should be recited by
10155,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"rhapsodists at every quinquennial holding of the Panathenaea.""[4] No"
10156,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"date is given, but Lycurgus must apparently be thinking of a date prior"
10157,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"to Tyrtaeus, as we shall see later. When Lycurgus says that the poems"
10158,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"of Homer alone were to be recited at the festival, he is of so late"
10159,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,a date that he probably means the Iliad and Odyssey. If the Act were
10160,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"made in Solon's time, ""Homer"" may conceivably include all heroic epic"
10161,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,poetry. We know nothing about it.
10162,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10163,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"Isocrates[5] says that the ancestors of the Athenians ""desired to make"
10164,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"Homer's art honoured, both in contests of music (i.e. of the reciters)"
10165,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"and in the education of the young"" (Monro, _Iliad_, vol. i. p. 15)."
10166,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"Still later, in a passage with an important lacuna, Diogenes Laertius"
10167,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"says that Solon passed a law regulating the recitations,[6] the very"
10168,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,law which is attributed to Hipparchus by the author of the Dialogue
10169,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"of that name.[7] In Sicyon also, in the sixth century, there were"
10170,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,recitations of Homer by competing rhapsodists; they were put down by
10171,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,the tyrant Cleisthenes.[8]
10172,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10173,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,Mr. Monro says that for the existence of an Athenian law about
10174,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"Homeric recitations, whatever the date of that law may have been, we"
10175,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"have historical testimony. Indeed, if there were no such law, even"
10176,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,rhetoricans of the fourth century could scarcely tell the Athenians
10177,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"that such a law existed. But as to its date and scope, and the name"
10178,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"of the statesman who passed it, if any exact information had existed,"
10179,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,perhaps there might have been some agreement among the persons who
10180,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,speak of it. If nothing like a History of Literature existed before
10181,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"the fourth century, we can expect no information. If it did exist,"
10182,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"it was of no value to Ephorus, Heracleides, and the author of the"
10183,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,_Hipparchus_. They are all at odds.
10184,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10185,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"Mr. Monro says, as every man trained in historical criticism must say,"
10186,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"""modern scholars have tried to harmonise these notices, and to assign"
10187,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"to (the Spartan) Lycurgus (named by Ephorus), Solon (named by Diogenes"

10189,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"service done to Homer. ""This would be legitimate if there were reason"
10190,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"to regard any of the notices as historical. But, in fact, they are"
10191,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"merely mythical anecdotes, supplemented by the guesses of scholars.""[9]"
10192,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"Whatever Homeric critics may think, they will find no trained historian"
10193,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,to dissent from Mr. Munro on those points.
10194,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10195,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,_Historia silet_! History is mute. We only know that from an uncertain
10196,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"period there were quinquennial recitations of ""Homer,"" and Homer alone,"
10197,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"at Athens, and that ""Homer"" was used in education. Beyond that all is"
10198,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"""guesses of scholars."" These guesses vary according to the taste and"
10199,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,fancy of the learned.
10200,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10201,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,In this conclusion every one who is accustomed to historical
10202,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,criticism will agree with Mr. Monro. Nothing can be made out of late
10203,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"and contradictory statements; nothing beyond the fact that ""Homer"""
10204,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"(whatever may be meant by ""Homer"") was quinquennially recited, under"
10205,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"regulations, at Athens, and entered into public education."
10206,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10207,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"Mr. A. W. Verrall, however, says: ""In general, the very last thing that"

10241,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10242,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"For me, I frankly confess my own prepossessions, but consciousness of"
10243,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,his bias is the safeguard of the historian; it compels him to make
10244,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,certain that he adds nothing to and takes nothing from what Mr. Verrall

10246,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"Mr. Verrall insists that ""internal evidence about the history of a"

10260,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"The first testimony, or ""record,"" cited by Mr. Verrall has nothing"
10261,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"to say about our Homer as ""an artificial product of scholarship."" It"
10262,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"deals merely with the legalised recitation of Homeric poetry, and of"
10263,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"that poetry alone, at the Panathenaea. The text is that which Mr."

10266,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10267,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,That is good evidence. Lycurgus could not speak to the Athenians of
10268,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"a law which, to their knowledge, did not exist. Lycurgus, in fact,"
10269,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,had been cajoling his Athenian audience with a set of fables about
10270,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"their ancestors, whose patriotism and valour in _pre-Homeric times_ he"
10271,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,applauds. Did not Erechtheus in a war with Thrace sacrifice his own
10272,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"daughter in obedience to an oracle, and then defeat the invaders! For"
10273,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"this noble action Lycurgus cites a play by Euripides, _The Erechtheus_!"
10274,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10275,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,Lycurgus next says that Athens made a law that the poems of Homer
10276,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"alone should be recited at the Panathenaea; and that, encouraged by"

10283,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10284,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"That is all. Mr. Verrall writes: ""By Lycurgus this whole educational"
10285,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"movement, and the adoption of Homer as the basis of it, is attributed"
10286,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"to the Athenians as a people...."" What Mr. Verrall says about ""a"

10291,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,as he too truly says) of the Bible upon Scotland. All this about an

10296,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10297,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,Mr. Verrall has next to meet the charge of contradictions among the
10298,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"late writers who attribute to Solon, Pisistratus, and _Hipparchus_"
10299,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"the law about recitations at the Panathenaea. But these texts, except"
10300,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"the pseudo-Platonic _Hipparchus_, say nothing about Homer as ""an"
10301,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"artificial product of scholarship."" Mr. Verrall declares that Lycurgus"
10302,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"and the _Hipparchus_ say nothing about the ""arrangement"" of the poems,"
10303,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"""they speak merely of adoption and compilation.""[14] But Lycurgus"
10304,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"says nothing about compilation, the Hipparchus says nothing about"
10305,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,compilation.
10306,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10307,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"The _Hipparchus_ says, what Lycurgus does not say, ""that _Hipparchus_,"
10308,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"son of Pisistratus, first brought the poems of Homer to Attica, and"
10309,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,that he obliged the rhapsodists at the Panathenaic festival to recite
10310,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"consecutively, so that the people might hear entire poems, and not"

10315,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"Thucydides.[16] Mr. Verrall is not lucky, he chooses a very erroneous"
10316,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"anonymous author, and makes him speak of ""compilation,"" which I do not"

10321,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"Mr. Verrall palliates the contradictions in a curious way. ""These"
10322,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,ascriptions have presumably the same measure of truth as the connecting
10323,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,of the Reformation now with one and now writh another of the princes or

10325,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10326,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,I do not know what historian connects the Reformation with one
10327,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,statesman or prince and with one only. But the texts of Mr. Verrall
10328,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"attribute not a religious and political movement dating, in England,"
10329,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"from about 1370 to--?, but a single legislative Act, to several"
10330,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,statesmen of about four generations. They are not speaking of a
10331,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"prolonged ""educational movement,"" but of one legislative Act,--about"
10332,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,which they really know no particulars.
10333,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10334,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,The correct analogy to this Act is the authorisation of a translation
10335,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,of the Bible in England. No historian attributes that feat to any
10336,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,prince but gentle King Jamie: none says that it was due to Henry
10337,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"VIII., Edward VI., or Elizabeth. The historian cannot assume that"
10338,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"when Diogenes Laertius attributes the law on recitations to Solon,"
10339,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"and the _Hipparchus_ attributes it to the son of Pisistratus, both"
10340,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,authorities mean only that a whole educational movement occurred in
10341,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,the sixth century. The existence of primary education in the Athens
10342,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,of the seventh and sixth centuries is proved by the multitude of
10343,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"_inscribed_ vases with paintings of Homeric, Cyclic, and Attic legends;"
10344,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,but Diogenes and the _Hipparchus_ are speaking variously about a single
10345,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,legislative enactment.
10346,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,
10347,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"Mr. Verrall next supposes that the ""Homer"" then recited and taught"
10348,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"at Athens was probably the whole ""Cycle"" of Cyclic poems.[19] This"
10349,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"question he must settle with Mr. Murray, who, we have seen, says that"
10350,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,the poetry selected for recitation at the Panathenaea was none but the
10351,THE ALLEGED ATHENIAN RECENSION OF HOMER,"still fluid lays of which, as I understand, our two epics are the final"

10426,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),chronicle poem of events so mythical and remote could not resemble a

10441,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"take an example, we have _The Wallace_ of Blind Harry (_circ_. 1460),"
10442,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"a book about as long as the _Odyssey_. Harry's materials were ""a mass"

10448,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),the _Cypria_ cannot be borrowed from before it is made. A poet who
10449,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"relies on the _mass of tradition_ is not borrowing from a _book,_ any"
10450,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),more than Harry was borrowing from a book (his use of an alleged book
10451,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"by Wallace's chaplain, John Blair, is another question). Manifestly"

10460,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"and so on, with his assertion that another book, the _Iliad_, borrows"
10461,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"passages from them, which led me to suppose that the lending poems"
10462,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"were, in his opinion, _complete_ (in one form or another) when the"
10463,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),_Iliad_ borrowed from them. Here I misinterpreted him.
10464,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),
10465,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"Had Mr. Murray written: ""Other passages,"" in the _Iliad_, ""seem to be"

10470,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"The true view of the case, Mr. Murray's own view, seems to be this:"
10471,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),there might be actual Greek books (probably not definitely _named_ till
10472,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"a later age), and these books might, like the _Chanson de Roland_,"
10473,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"be _remaniés_; might be modernised, and might receive additions;"
10474,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"and another book, that which we call the _Iliad_, might exist, and,"
10475,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),like the _Chanson de Roland_ (in the _Roncevaux_ poem) might receive
10476,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"additions, the facts, in some cases, being taken from the other books,"
10477,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),which were undergoing similar vicissitudes.
10478,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),
10479,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"This is not my own view of what occurred, but it is a thinkable state"
10480,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"of things, and I regret that I did not understand Mr. Murray's position."
10481,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),
10482,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"At the same time, if one found in a _chanson_ of the thirteenth century"
10483,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),matter borrowed from the conclusion of _Roncevaux_ (the _remaniement_
10484,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"of the _Chanson de Roland_), one could not say that it was borrowed"
10485,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"from _Roland_, a substantive earlier poem, in a metre not that of"

10487,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),
10488,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),There is a sense in which all early Greek epics might be said to borrow

10490,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),misleading. The fact would be more correctly expressed by saying
10491,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),that the epics probably (like our own traditional ballads certainly)

10557,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"a ballad, if it is to resemble the traditional sort, cannot be made"
10558,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"on other principles. Ancient Greek epic poetry, intended, like the"

10564,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),
10565,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),I lately met with a curious example of the critical method of treating
10566,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"Homer applied in certain criticisms of Scottish ballads. One ballad,"
10567,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"""Auld Maitland,"" was distributed, by the critic, between Hogg and"
10568,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),Scott. In certain stanzas he found _Wiederholungen_ of lines in the
10569,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"English ballad of ""Chevy Chase,"" and of others in Herd's version of"
10570,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"""Otterburne"" (1776). The verses in ""Auld Maitland"" which presented"
10571,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),_these Wiederholungen_ were speculatively assigned to the Ettrick

10578,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"Now _that_ line occurs in Scott's, and did not occur in Hogg's version"
10579,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"of ""Jamie Telfer."" Moreover, Scott himself, the critic believes, wrote"
10580,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"the part of ""Jamie Telfer"" where the Scotts ride and run. ""If Hogg is"

10586,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"criticism of Homeric _Wiederholungen_! In fact, ballad poetry and"
10587,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),Homeric poetry have stocks of formulae open to every maker. Not to use
10588,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),them would be not to play the game.
10589,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),

10591,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"as Hogg's had been, by the occurrence, in ""Auld Maitland,"" of"
10592,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),ballad-formulae which also appear in ballads edited by Scott.

10594,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"Enfin, ""Auld Maitland"" was declared to be, in the critic's opinion, in"

10596,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"traditional. Scott detected Hogg, entered into the plot, wrote stanzas"
10597,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"and lines into the ballad, and palmed it off on the public.[6]"
10598,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),
10599,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),The critic happened not to know (or did not mention) the history of
10600,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),how the ballad was first heard by Laidlaw in the mouth of a servant
10601,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"girl; and how Laidlaw got a version in manuscript from Hogg, who heard"
10602,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"a recitation by his uncle, Will o' Phawhope. The critic had never seen"
10603,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"the extant original MS. sent by Hogg to Laidlaw, and given by Laidlaw"
10604,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"to Scott. He had never, of course, collated that manuscript with the"
10605,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"copy published by Scott. When we make the collation, we find that Scott"
10606,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),neither rejected nor added a single stanza; that he made a necessary
10607,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),and successful emendation in one line; and that the few small verbal
10608,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),differences between Hogg's MS. and Scott's printed ballad may be
10609,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),accounted for by the fact that the copy printed from was that received
10610,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),from a recitation by Hogg's mother.
10611,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),
10612,THE LOST EPICS AND THE HOMERIC EPICS (_WIEDERHOLUNGEN_),"Thus the higher criticism, working on lines recognised as orthodox"
