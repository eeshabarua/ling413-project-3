45,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
46,PREFACE.,
47,PREFACE.,"In the spring of 1862 I was induced, at the request of some personal"
48,PREFACE.,"friends, to print, for private circulation only, a small volume of"
49,PREFACE.,"“Translations of Poems Ancient and Modern,” in which was included the"
50,PREFACE.,first Book of the Iliad. The opinions expressed by some competent
51,PREFACE.,judges of the degree of success which had attended this “attempt to
52,PREFACE.,"infuse into an almost literal English version something of the spirit,"
53,PREFACE.,"as well as the simplicity, of the great original,” [Footnote:"
54,PREFACE.,Introduction to unpublished volume.] were sufficiently favourable to
55,PREFACE.,encourage me to continue the work which I had begun. It has afforded
56,PREFACE.,"me, in the intervals of more urgent business, an unfailing, and"
57,PREFACE.,constantly increasing source of interest; and it is not without a
58,PREFACE.,"feeling of regret at the completion of my task, and a sincere"
59,PREFACE.,"diffidence as to its success, that I venture to submit the result of my"
60,PREFACE.,labour to the ordeal of public criticism.
61,PREFACE.,
62,PREFACE.,"Various causes, irrespective of any demerits of the work itself, forbid"
63,PREFACE.,"me to anticipate for this translation any extensive popularity. First,"
64,PREFACE.,"I fear that the taste for, and appreciation of, Classical Literature,"
65,PREFACE.,"are greatly on the decline; next, those who have kept up their"
66,PREFACE.,"classical studies, and are able to read and enjoy the original, will"
67,PREFACE.,hardly take an interest in a mere translation; while the English
68,PREFACE.,"reader, unacquainted with Greek, will naturally prefer the harmonious"
69,PREFACE.,versification and polished brilliancy of Pope’s translation; with
70,PREFACE.,"which, as a happy adaptation of the Homeric story to the spirit of"
71,PREFACE.,"English poetry, I have not the presumption to enter into competition."
72,PREFACE.,"But, admirable as it is, Pope’s Iliad can hardly be said to be Homer’s"
73,PREFACE.,"Iliad; and there may be some who, having lost the familiarity with the"
74,PREFACE.,"original language which they once possessed, may, if I have at all"
75,PREFACE.,"succeeded in my attempt, have recalled to their minds a faint echo of"
76,PREFACE.,"the strains which delighted their earlier days, and may recognize some"
77,PREFACE.,slight trace of the original perfume.
78,PREFACE.,
79,PREFACE.,"Numerous as have been the translators of the Iliad, or of parts of it,"
80,PREFACE.,the metres which have been selected have been almost as various: the
81,PREFACE.,"ordinary couplet in rhyme, the Spenserian stanza, the Trochaic or"
82,PREFACE.,"Ballad metre, all have had their partisans, even to that “pestilent"
83,PREFACE.,heresy” of the so-called English Hexameter; a metre wholly repugnant to
84,PREFACE.,the genius of our language; which can only be pressed into the service
85,PREFACE.,"by a violation of every rule of prosody; and of which, notwithstanding"
86,PREFACE.,"my respect for the eminent men who have attempted to naturalize it, I"
87,PREFACE.,could never read ten lines without being irresistibly reminded of
88,PREFACE.,Canning’s
89,PREFACE.,
90,PREFACE.,"“Dactylics call’st thou them? God help thee, silly one!”"
91,PREFACE.,
92,PREFACE.,
93,PREFACE.,"But in the progress of this work, I have been more and more confirmed"
94,PREFACE.,"in the opinion which I expressed at its commencement, that (whatever"
95,PREFACE.,may be the extent of my own individual failure) “if justice is ever to
96,PREFACE.,"be done to the easy flow and majestic simplicity of the grand old Poet,"
97,PREFACE.,it can only be in the Heroic blank verse.” I have seen isolated
98,PREFACE.,passages admirably rendered in other metres; and there are many
99,PREFACE.,instances in which a translation line for line and couplet for couplet
100,PREFACE.,"naturally suggests itself, and in which it is sometimes difficult to"
101,PREFACE.,avoid an involuntary rhyme; but the blank verse appears to me the only
102,PREFACE.,"metre capable of adapting itself to all the gradations, if I may use"
103,PREFACE.,"the term, of the Homeric style; from the finished poetry of the"
104,PREFACE.,"numerous similes, in which every touch is nature, and nothing is"
105,PREFACE.,"overcoloured or exaggerated, down to the simple, almost homely, style"
106,PREFACE.,of some portions of the narrative. Least of all can any other metre do
107,PREFACE.,"full justice to the spirit and freedom of the various speeches, in"
108,PREFACE.,"which the old warriors give utterance, without disguise or restraint,"
109,PREFACE.,to all their strong and genuine emotions. To subject these to the
110,PREFACE.,trammels of couplet and rhyme would be as destructive of their chief
111,PREFACE.,"characteristics, as the application of a similar process to the"
112,PREFACE.,"Paradise Lost of Milton, or the tragedies of Shakespeare; the effect"
113,PREFACE.,"indeed may be seen by comparing, with some of the noblest speeches of"
114,PREFACE.,"the latter, the few couplets which he seems to have considered himself"
115,PREFACE.,"bound by custom to tack on to their close, at the end of a scene or an"
116,PREFACE.,act.
117,PREFACE.,
118,PREFACE.,"I have adopted, not without hesitation, the Latin, rather than the"
119,PREFACE.,"Greek, nomenclature for the Heathen Deities. I have been induced to do"
120,PREFACE.,so from the manifest incongruity of confounding the two; and from the
121,PREFACE.,fact that though English readers may be familiar with the names of
122,PREFACE.,"Zeus, or Aphrodite, or even Poseidon, those of Hera, or Ares, or"
123,PREFACE.,"Hephaestus, or Leto, would hardly convey to them a definite"
124,PREFACE.,signification.
125,PREFACE.,
126,PREFACE.,It has been my aim throughout to produce a translation and not a
127,PREFACE.,"paraphrase; not indeed such a translation as would satisfy, with regard"
128,PREFACE.,"to each word, the rigid requirements of accurate scholarship; but such"
129,PREFACE.,as would fairly and honestly give the sense and spirit of every
130,PREFACE.,"passage, and of every line; omitting nothing, and expanding nothing;"
131,PREFACE.,"and adhering, as closely as our language will allow, ever to every"
132,PREFACE.,"epithet which is capable of being translated, and which has, in the"
133,PREFACE.,"particular passage, anything of a special and distinctive character. Of"
134,PREFACE.,"the many deficiencies in my execution of this intention, I am but too"
135,PREFACE.,"conscious; whether I have been in any degree successful, must be left"
136,PREFACE.,to the impartial decision of such of the Public as may honour this work
137,PREFACE.,with their perusal.

147,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,The favourable reception which has been given to the first Editions of
148,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"this work, far exceeding my most sanguine hopes, affords a gratifying"
149,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"proof how far, in my preface, I had overrated the extent to which the"
150,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"taste for, and appreciation of, Classical Literature had declined. It"
151,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"will not, I hope, be thought extraordinary that some errors and"
152,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"inaccuracies should have found their way into a translation executed, I"
153,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"must admit, somewhat hastily, and with less of the “limae labor” than I"
154,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"should have bestowed upon it, had I ventured to anticipate for it so"
155,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"extensive a circulation. My thanks, therefore, are due to those"
156,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"critics, who, either publicly or privately, have called my attention to"
157,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,passages in which the sense of the Author has been either incorrectly
158,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"or imperfectly rendered. All of these I have examined, and have availed"
159,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,myself of several of the suggestions offered for their correction; and
160,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"a careful revision of the whole work, and renewed comparison with the"
161,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"original, have enabled me to discover other defects, the removal of"
162,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"which will, I hope, render the present Edition, especially in the eyes"
163,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,"of Classical Scholars, somewhat more worthy of the favour which has"
164,NOTE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.,been accorded to its predecessors.

189,THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.,"however, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on"
190,THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.,Briseis in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his

228,BOOK I.,"May the great Gods, who on Olympus dwell,"
229,BOOK I.,"Grant you yon hostile city to destroy,"

236,BOOK I.,"Not so Atrides; he, with haughty mien,"
237,BOOK I.,"And bitter speech, the trembling sire address’d:"
238,BOOK I.,"“Old man, I warn thee, that beside our ships"
239,BOOK I.,"I find thee not, or ling’ring now, or back"
240,BOOK I.,Returning; lest thou prove of small avail

246,BOOK I.,"Incense me not, lest ill betide thee now.”"
247,BOOK I.,
248,BOOK I.,"He said: the old man trembled, and obeyed;"
249,BOOK I.,Beside the many-dashing Ocean’s shore
250,BOOK I.,"Silent he pass’d; and all apart, he pray’d"
251,BOOK I.,"To great Apollo, fair Latona’s son:"
252,BOOK I.,
253,BOOK I.,"“Hear me, God of the silver bow! whose care"
254,BOOK I.,"Chrysa surrounds, and Cilia’s lovely vale;"
255,BOOK I.,Whose sov’reign sway o’er Tenedos extends;
256,BOOK I.,"O Smintheus, hear! if e’er my offered gifts"
257,BOOK I.,Found favour in thy sight; if e’er to thee
258,BOOK I.,"I burn’d the fat of bulls and choicest goats,"
259,BOOK I.,Grant me this boon—upon the Grecian host
260,BOOK I.,Let thine unerring darts avenge my tears.”
261,BOOK I.,
262,BOOK I.,"Thus as he pray’d, his pray’r Apollo heard:"
263,BOOK I.,"Along Olympus’ heights he pass’d, his heart"
264,BOOK I.,Burning with wrath; behind his shoulders hung
265,BOOK I.,"His bow, and ample quiver; at his back"
266,BOOK I.,Rattled the fateful arrows as he mov’d;
267,BOOK I.,"Like the night-cloud he pass’d, and from afar"
268,BOOK I.,"He bent against the ships, and sped the bolt;"
269,BOOK I.,And fierce and deadly twang’d the silver bow.
270,BOOK I.,"First on the mules and dogs, on man the last,"
271,BOOK I.,"Was pour’d the arrowy storm; and through the camp,"
272,BOOK I.,"Constant and num’rous, blaz’d the fun’ral fires."
273,BOOK I.,
274,BOOK I.,Nine days the heav’nly Archer on the troops
275,BOOK I.,"Hurl’d his dread shafts; the tenth, th’ assembled Greeks"
276,BOOK I.,Achilles call’d to council; so inspir’d
277,BOOK I.,"By Juno, white-arm’d Goddess, who beheld"
278,BOOK I.,With pitying eyes the wasting hosts of Greece.
279,BOOK I.,"When all were met, and closely throng’d around,"
280,BOOK I.,"Rose the swift-footed chief, and thus began:"
281,BOOK I.,
282,BOOK I.,"“Great son of Atreus, to my mind there seems,"
283,BOOK I.,"If we would ’scape from death, one only course,"
284,BOOK I.,Home to retrace our steps: since here at once
285,BOOK I.,By war and pestilence our forces waste.
286,BOOK I.,"But seek we first some prophet, or some priest,"
287,BOOK I.,Or some wise vision-seer (since visions too
288,BOOK I.,"From Jove proceed), who may the cause explain,"
289,BOOK I.,Which with such deadly wrath Apollo fires:
290,BOOK I.,If for neglected hecatombs or pray’rs
291,BOOK I.,He blame us; or if fat of lambs and goats
292,BOOK I.,May soothe his anger and the plague assuage.”
293,BOOK I.,
294,BOOK I.,"This said, he sat; and Thestor’s son arose,"
295,BOOK I.,"Calchas, the chief of seers, to whom were known"
296,BOOK I.,"The present, and the future, and the past;"
297,BOOK I.,"Who, by his mystic art, Apollo’s gift,"
298,BOOK I.,Guided to Ilium’s shore the Grecian fleet.
299,BOOK I.,"Who thus with cautious speech replied, and said;"
300,BOOK I.,"“Achilles, lov’d of Heav’n, thou bidd’st me say"
301,BOOK I.,Why thus incens’d the far-destroying King;
302,BOOK I.,"Therefore I speak; but promise thou, and swear,"
303,BOOK I.,"By word and hand, to bear me harmless through."
304,BOOK I.,"For well I know my speech must one offend,"
305,BOOK I.,"The Argive chief, o’er all the Greeks supreme;"
306,BOOK I.,And terrible to men of low estate
307,BOOK I.,The anger of a King; for though awhile
308,BOOK I.,"He veil his wrath, yet in his bosom pent"
309,BOOK I.,"It still is nurs’d, until the time arrive;"
310,BOOK I.,"Say, then, wilt thou protect me, if I speak?”"
311,BOOK I.,
312,BOOK I.,"Him answer’d thus Achilles, swift of foot:"
313,BOOK I.,“Speak boldly out whate’er thine art can tell;
314,BOOK I.,"For by Apollo’s self I swear, whom thou,"
315,BOOK I.,"O Calchas, serv’st, and who thy words inspires,"
316,BOOK I.,"That, while I live, and see the light of Heav’n,"
317,BOOK I.,"Not one of all the Greeks shall dare on thee,"
318,BOOK I.,"Beside our ships, injurious hands to lay:"
319,BOOK I.,"No, not if Agamemnon’s self were he,"
320,BOOK I.,Who ’mid our warriors boasts the foremost place.”
321,BOOK I.,
322,BOOK I.,"Embolden’d thus, th’ unerring prophet spoke:"
323,BOOK I.,"“Not for neglected hecatombs or pray’rs,"
324,BOOK I.,"But for his priest, whom Agamemnon scorn’d,"
325,BOOK I.,"Nor took his ransom, nor his child restor’d;"
326,BOOK I.,On his account the Far-destroyer sends
327,BOOK I.,"This scourge of pestilence, and yet will send;"
328,BOOK I.,"Nor shall we cease his heavy hand to feel,"
329,BOOK I.,"Till to her sire we give the bright-ey’d girl,"
330,BOOK I.,"Unbought, unransom’d, and to Chrysa’s shore"
331,BOOK I.,"A solemn hecatomb despatch; this done,"
332,BOOK I.,"The God, appeas’d, his anger may remit.”"
333,BOOK I.,
334,BOOK I.,"This said, he sat; and Atreus’ godlike son,"
335,BOOK I.,"The mighty monarch, Agamemnon, rose,"
336,BOOK I.,"His dark soul fill’d with fury, and his eyes"
337,BOOK I.,Flashing like flames of fire; on Calchas first
338,BOOK I.,"A with’ring glance he cast, and thus he spoke;"
339,BOOK I.,
340,BOOK I.,“Prophet of ill! thou never speak’st to me
341,BOOK I.,But words of evil omen; for thy soul
342,BOOK I.,"Delights to augur ill, but aught of good"
343,BOOK I.,"Thou never yet hast promis’d, nor perform’d."
344,BOOK I.,And now among the Greeks thou spread’st abroad
345,BOOK I.,"Thy lying prophecies, that all these ills"
346,BOOK I.,"Come from the Far-destroyer, for that I"
347,BOOK I.,"Refus’d the ransom of my lovely prize,"
348,BOOK I.,"And that I rather chose herself to keep,"
349,BOOK I.,"To me not less than Clytemnestra dear,"
350,BOOK I.,My virgin-wedded wife; nor less adorn’d
351,BOOK I.,"In gifts of form, of feature, or of mind."
352,BOOK I.,"Yet, if it must he so, I give her back;"
353,BOOK I.,"I wish my people’s safety, not their death."
354,BOOK I.,"But seek me out forthwith some other spoil,"
355,BOOK I.,Lest empty-handed I alone appear
356,BOOK I.,Of all the Greeks; for this would ill beseem;
357,BOOK I.,"And how I lose my present share, ye see.”"
358,BOOK I.,
359,BOOK I.,"To whom Achilles, swift of foot, replied:"
360,BOOK I.,"“Haughtiest of men, and greediest of the prey!"
361,BOOK I.,How shall our valiant Greeks for thee seek out
362,BOOK I.,Some other spoil? no common fund have we
363,BOOK I.,Of hoarded treasures; what our arms have won
364,BOOK I.,"From captur’d towns, has been already shar’d,"
365,BOOK I.,Nor can we now resume th’ apportion’d spoil.
366,BOOK I.,"Restore the maid, obedient to the God!"
367,BOOK I.,And if Heav’n will that we the strong-built walls
368,BOOK I.,"Of Troy should raze, our warriors will to thee"
369,BOOK I.,"A threefold, fourfold recompense assign.”"
370,BOOK I.,
371,BOOK I.,To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus:
372,BOOK I.,"“Think not, Achilles, valiant though thou art"
373,BOOK I.,"In fight, and godlike, to defraud me thus;"
374,BOOK I.,"Thou shalt not so persuade me, nor o’erreach."
375,BOOK I.,"Think’st thou to keep thy portion of the spoil,"
376,BOOK I.,While I with empty hands sit humbly down?
377,BOOK I.,The bright-ey’d girl thou bidd’st me to restore;
378,BOOK I.,If then the valiant Greeks for me seek out
379,BOOK I.,"Some other spoil, some compensation just,"
380,BOOK I.,"’Tis well: if not, I with my own right hand"
381,BOOK I.,"Will from some other chief, from thee perchance,"
382,BOOK I.,"Or Ajax, or Ulysses, wrest his prey;"
383,BOOK I.,"And woe to him, on whomsoe’er I call!"
384,BOOK I.,But this for future counsel we remit:
385,BOOK I.,"Haste we then now our dark-ribb’d bark to launch,"
386,BOOK I.,"Muster a fitting crew, and place on board"
387,BOOK I.,The sacred hecatomb; then last embark
388,BOOK I.,The fair Chryseis; and in chief command
389,BOOK I.,"Let some one of our councillors be plac’d,"
390,BOOK I.,"Ajax, Ulysses, or Idomeneus,"
391,BOOK I.,"Or thou, the most ambitious of them all,"
392,BOOK I.,That so our rites may soothe the angry God.”
393,BOOK I.,
394,BOOK I.,To whom Achilles thus with scornful glance;
395,BOOK I.,"“Oh, cloth’d in shamelessness! oh, sordid soul!"
396,BOOK I.,How canst thou hope that any Greek for thee
397,BOOK I.,Will brave the toils of travel or of war?
398,BOOK I.,Well dost thou know that ’t was no feud of mine
399,BOOK I.,With Troy’s brave sons that brought me here in arms;
400,BOOK I.,They never did me wrong; they never drove
401,BOOK I.,"My cattle, or my horses; never sought"
402,BOOK I.,"In Phthia’s fertile, life-sustaining fields"
403,BOOK I.,To waste the crops; for wide between us lay
404,BOOK I.,The shadowy mountains and the roaring sea.
405,BOOK I.,"With thee, O void of shame! with thee we sail’d,"
406,BOOK I.,"For Menelaus and for thee, ingrate,"
407,BOOK I.,Glory and fame on Trojan crests to win.
408,BOOK I.,"All this hast thou forgotten, or despis’d;"
409,BOOK I.,And threat’nest now to wrest from me the prize
410,BOOK I.,"I labour’d hard to win, and Greeks bestow’d."
411,BOOK I.,"Nor does my portion ever equal thine,"
412,BOOK I.,When on some populous town our troops have made
413,BOOK I.,Successful war; in the contentious fight
414,BOOK I.,The larger portion of the toil is mine;
415,BOOK I.,"But when the day of distribution comes,"
416,BOOK I.,"Thine is the richest spoil; while I, forsooth,"
417,BOOK I.,Must be too well content to bear on board
418,BOOK I.,Some paltry prize for all my warlike toil.
419,BOOK I.,"To Phthia now I go; so better far,"
420,BOOK I.,"To steer my homeward course, and leave thee here"
421,BOOK I.,"But little like, I deem, dishonouring me,"
422,BOOK I.,To fill thy coffers with the spoils of war.”
423,BOOK I.,
424,BOOK I.,"Whom answer’d Agamemnon, King of men:"
425,BOOK I.,"“Fly then, if such thy mind! I ask thee not"
426,BOOK I.,On mine account to stay; others there are
427,BOOK I.,Will guard my honour and avenge my cause:
428,BOOK I.,"And chief of all, the Lord of counsel, Jove!"
429,BOOK I.,"Of all the Heav’n-born Kings, thou art the man"
430,BOOK I.,I hate the most; for thou delight’st in nought
431,BOOK I.,But war and strife: thy prowess I allow;
432,BOOK I.,"Yet this, remember, is the gift of Heav’n."
433,BOOK I.,"Return then, with thy vessels, if thou wilt,"
434,BOOK I.,"And with thy followers, home; and lord it there"
435,BOOK I.,Over thy Myrmidons! I heed thee not!
436,BOOK I.,I care not for thy fury! Hear my threat:
437,BOOK I.,"Since Phoebus wrests Chryseis from my arms,"
438,BOOK I.,"In mine own ship, and with mine own good crew,"
439,BOOK I.,"Her I send forth; and, in her stead, I mean,"
440,BOOK I.,"Ev’n from thy tent, myself, to bear thy prize,"
441,BOOK I.,The fair Briseis; that henceforth thou know
442,BOOK I.,"How far I am thy master; and that, taught"
443,BOOK I.,"By thine example, others too may fear"
444,BOOK I.,"To rival me, and brave me to my face.”"
445,BOOK I.,
446,BOOK I.,"Thus while he spake, Achilles chaf’d with rage;"
447,BOOK I.,And in his manly breast his heart was torn
448,BOOK I.,With thoughts conflicting—whether from his side
449,BOOK I.,"To draw his mighty sword, and thrusting by"
450,BOOK I.,"Th’ assembled throng, to kill th’ insulting King;"
451,BOOK I.,"Or school his soul, and keep his anger down."
452,BOOK I.,"But while in mind and spirit thus he mus’d,"
453,BOOK I.,"And half unsheath’d his sword, from Heav’n came down"
454,BOOK I.,"Minerva, sent by Juno, white-arm’d Queen,"
455,BOOK I.,Whose love and care both chiefs alike enjoy’d.
456,BOOK I.,"She stood behind, and by the yellow hair"
457,BOOK I.,"She held the son of Peleus, visible"
458,BOOK I.,"To him alone, by all the rest unseen."
459,BOOK I.,"Achilles, wond’ring, turn’d, and straight he knew"
460,BOOK I.,The blue-eyed Pallas; awful was her glance;
461,BOOK I.,Whom thus the chief with winged words address’d:
462,BOOK I.,
463,BOOK I.,"“Why com’st thou, child of aegis-bearing Jove?"
464,BOOK I.,To see the arrogance of Atreus’ son?
465,BOOK I.,"But this I say, and will make good my words,"
466,BOOK I.,This insolence may cost him soon his life.”
467,BOOK I.,
468,BOOK I.,To whom the blue-ey’d Goddess thus replied:
469,BOOK I.,"“From Heav’n I came, to curb, if thou wilt hear,"
470,BOOK I.,"Thy fury; sent by Juno, white-arm’d Queen,"
471,BOOK I.,Whose love and care ye both alike enjoy.
472,BOOK I.,"Cease, then, these broils, and draw not thus thy sword;"
473,BOOK I.,"In words, indeed, assail him as thou wilt."
474,BOOK I.,"But this I promise, and will make it good,"
475,BOOK I.,"The time shall come, when for this insolence"
476,BOOK I.,A threefold compensation shall be thine;
477,BOOK I.,"Only be sway’d by me, and curb thy wrath.”"
478,BOOK I.,
479,BOOK I.,"Whom answer’d thus Achilles, swift of foot:"
480,BOOK I.,"“Goddess, I needs must yield to your commands,"
481,BOOK I.,Indignant though I be—for so ’tis best;
482,BOOK I.,"Who hears the Gods, of them his pray’rs are heard.”"
483,BOOK I.,
484,BOOK I.,He said: and on the silver hilt he stay’d
485,BOOK I.,"His pow’rful hand, and flung his mighty sword"
486,BOOK I.,"Back to its scabbard, to Minerva’s word"
487,BOOK I.,Obedient: she her heav’nward course pursued
488,BOOK I.,To join th’ Immortals in th’ abode of Jove.
489,BOOK I.,"But Peleus’ son, with undiminish’d wrath,"
490,BOOK I.,Atrides thus with bitter words address’d:
491,BOOK I.,
492,BOOK I.,"“Thou sot, with eye of dog, and heart of deer!"
493,BOOK I.,Who never dar’st to lead in armed fight
494,BOOK I.,"Th’ assembled host, nor with a chosen few"
495,BOOK I.,To man the secret ambush—for thou fear’st
496,BOOK I.,"To look on death—no doubt ’tis easier far,"
497,BOOK I.,"Girt with thy troops, to plunder of his right"
498,BOOK I.,Whoe’er may venture to oppose thy will!
499,BOOK I.,"A tyrant King, because thou rul’st o’er slaves!"
500,BOOK I.,"Were it not so, this insult were thy last."
501,BOOK I.,"But this I say, and with an oath confirm,"
502,BOOK I.,"By this my royal staff, which never more"
503,BOOK I.,"Shall put forth leaf nor spray, since first it left"
504,BOOK I.,"Upon the mountain-side its parent stem,"
505,BOOK I.,Nor blossom more; since all around the axe
506,BOOK I.,"Hath lopp’d both leaf and bark, and now ’tis borne"
507,BOOK I.,"Emblem of justice, by the sons of Greece,"
508,BOOK I.,Who guard the sacred ministry of law
509,BOOK I.,Before the face of Jove! a mighty oath!
510,BOOK I.,"The time shall come, when all the sons of Greece"
511,BOOK I.,"Shall mourn Achilles’ loss; and thou the while,"
512,BOOK I.,"Heart-rent, shalt be all-impotent to aid,"
513,BOOK I.,When by the warrior-slayer Hector’s hand
514,BOOK I.,Many shall fall; and then thy soul shall mourn
515,BOOK I.,The slight on Grecia’s bravest warrior cast.”
516,BOOK I.,
517,BOOK I.,Thus spoke Pelides; and upon the ground
518,BOOK I.,"He cast his staff, with golden studs emboss’d,"
519,BOOK I.,"And took his seat; on th’ other side, in wrath,"
520,BOOK I.,Atrides burn’d; but Nestor interpos’d;
521,BOOK I.,"Nestor, the leader of the Pylian host,"
522,BOOK I.,"The smooth-tongued chief, from whose persuasive lips"
523,BOOK I.,Sweeter than honey flowed the stream of speech.
524,BOOK I.,Two generations of the sons of men
525,BOOK I.,"For him were past and gone, who with himself"
526,BOOK I.,"Were born and bred on Pylos’ lovely shore,"
527,BOOK I.,And o’er the third he now held royal sway.
528,BOOK I.,He thus with prudent words the chiefs address’d:
529,BOOK I.,
530,BOOK I.,"“Alas, alas! what grief is this for Greece!"
531,BOOK I.,"What joy for Priam, and for Priam’s sons!"
532,BOOK I.,"What exultation for the men of Troy,"
533,BOOK I.,"To hear of feuds ’tween you, of all the Greeks"
534,BOOK I.,"The first in council, and the first in fight!"
535,BOOK I.,"Yet, hear my words, I pray; in years, at least,"
536,BOOK I.,Ye both must yield to me; and in times past
537,BOOK I.,"I liv’d with men, and they despis’d me not,"
538,BOOK I.,"Abler in counsel, greater than yourselves."
539,BOOK I.,"Such men I never saw, and ne’er shall see,"
540,BOOK I.,"As Pirithous and Dryas, wise and brave,"
541,BOOK I.,"Coeneus, Exadius, godlike Polypheme,"
542,BOOK I.,"And Theseus, Ægeus’ more than mortal son."
543,BOOK I.,The mightiest they among the sons of men;
544,BOOK I.,"The mightiest they, and of the forest beasts"
545,BOOK I.,"Strove with the mightiest, and their rage subdued."
546,BOOK I.,"With them from distant lands, from Pylos’ shore"
547,BOOK I.,"I join’d my forces, and their call obey’d;"
548,BOOK I.,"With them I play’d my part; with them, not one"
549,BOOK I.,Would dare to fight of mortals now on earth.
550,BOOK I.,"Yet they my counsels heard, my voice obey’d;"
551,BOOK I.,"And hear ye also, for my words are wise."
552,BOOK I.,"Nor thou, though great thou be, attempt to rob"
553,BOOK I.,"Achilles of his prize, but let him keep"
554,BOOK I.,The spoil assign’d him by the sons of Greece;
555,BOOK I.,"Nor thou, Pelides, with the monarch strive"
556,BOOK I.,In rivalry; for ne’er to sceptred King
557,BOOK I.,"Hath Jove such pow’rs, as to Atrides, giv’n;"
558,BOOK I.,"And valiant though thou art, and Goddess-born,"
559,BOOK I.,"Yet mightier he, for wider is his sway."
560,BOOK I.,"Atrides, curb thy wrath! while I beseech"
561,BOOK I.,Achilles to forbear; in whom the Greeks
562,BOOK I.,From adverse war their great defender see.”
563,BOOK I.,
564,BOOK I.,"To whom the monarch, Agamemnon, thus:"
565,BOOK I.,"“O father, full of wisdom are thy words;"
566,BOOK I.,But this proud chief o’er all would domineer;
567,BOOK I.,"O’er all he seeks to rule, o’er all to reign,"
568,BOOK I.,To all to dictate; which I will not bear.
569,BOOK I.,"Grant that the Gods have giv’n him warlike might,"
570,BOOK I.,Gave they unbridled license to his tongue?”
571,BOOK I.,
572,BOOK I.,"To whom Achilles, interrupting, thus:"
573,BOOK I.,“Coward and slave indeed I might be deem’d.
574,BOOK I.,Could I submit to make thy word my law;
575,BOOK I.,To others thy commands; seek not to me
576,BOOK I.,"To dictate, for I follow thee no more."
577,BOOK I.,"But hear me speak, and ponder what I say:"
578,BOOK I.,For the fair girl I fight not (since you choose
579,BOOK I.,To take away the prize yourselves bestow’d)
580,BOOK I.,With thee or any one; but of the rest
581,BOOK I.,"My dark swift ship contains, against my will"
582,BOOK I.,"On nought shalt thou, unpunish’d, lay thy hand."
583,BOOK I.,"Make trial if thou wilt, that these may know;"
584,BOOK I.,Thy life-blood soon should reek upon my spear.”
585,BOOK I.,
586,BOOK I.,"After this conflict keen of angry speech,"
587,BOOK I.,"The chiefs arose, the assembly was dispers’d."
588,BOOK I.,
589,BOOK I.,"With his own followers, and Menoetius’ son,"
590,BOOK I.,Achilles to his tents and ships withdrew.
591,BOOK I.,"But Atreus’ son launch’d a swift-sailing bark,"
592,BOOK I.,"With twenty rowers mann’d, and plac’d on board"
593,BOOK I.,The sacred hecatomb; then last embark’d
594,BOOK I.,"The fair Chryseis, and in chief command"
595,BOOK I.,"Laertes’ son, the sage Ulysses, plac’d."
596,BOOK I.,They swiftly sped along the wat’ry way.
597,BOOK I.,
598,BOOK I.,"Next, proclamation through the camp was made"
599,BOOK I.,"To purify the host; and in the sea,"
600,BOOK I.,"Obedient to the word, they purified;"
601,BOOK I.,Then to Apollo solemn rites perform’d
602,BOOK I.,"With faultless hecatombs of bulls and goats,"
603,BOOK I.,Upon the margin of the wat’ry waste;
604,BOOK I.,"And, wreath’d in smoke, the savour rose to Heav’n."
605,BOOK I.,
606,BOOK I.,"The camp thus occupied, the King pursued"
607,BOOK I.,His threaten’d plan of vengeance; to his side
608,BOOK I.,"Calling Talthybius and Eurybates,"
609,BOOK I.,"Heralds, and faithful followers, thus he spoke:"
610,BOOK I.,
611,BOOK I.,"“Haste to Achilles’ tent, and in your hand"
612,BOOK I.,Back with you thence the fair Briseis bring:
613,BOOK I.,"If he refuse to send her, I myself"
614,BOOK I.,"With a sufficient force will bear her thence,"
615,BOOK I.,"Which he may find, perchance, the worse for him.”"
616,BOOK I.,
617,BOOK I.,"So spake the monarch, and with stern command"
618,BOOK I.,Dismiss’d them; with reluctant steps they pass’d
619,BOOK I.,"Along the margin of the wat’ry waste,"
620,BOOK I.,"Till to the tents and ships they came, where lay"
621,BOOK I.,The warlike Myrmidons. Their chief they found
622,BOOK I.,Sitting beside his tent and dark-ribb’d ship.
623,BOOK I.,"Achilles mark’d their coming, not well pleas’d:"
624,BOOK I.,"With troubled mien, and awe-struck by the King,"
625,BOOK I.,"They stood, nor dar’d accost him; but himself"
626,BOOK I.,"Divin’d their errand, and address’d them thus:"
627,BOOK I.,
628,BOOK I.,"“Welcome, ye messengers of Gods and men,"
629,BOOK I.,"Heralds! approach in safety; not with you,"
630,BOOK I.,"But with Atrides, is my just offence,"
631,BOOK I.,Who for the fair Briseis sends you here.
632,BOOK I.,"Go, then, Patroclus, bring the maiden forth,"
633,BOOK I.,"And give her to their hands; but witness ye,"
634,BOOK I.,"Before the blessed Gods and mortal men,"
635,BOOK I.,"And to the face of that injurious King,"
636,BOOK I.,"When he shall need my arm, from shameful rout"
637,BOOK I.,"To save his followers; blinded by his rage,"
638,BOOK I.,He neither heeds experience of the past
639,BOOK I.,"Nor scans the future, provident how best"
640,BOOK I.,To guard his fleet and army from the foe.”
641,BOOK I.,
642,BOOK I.,"He spoke: obedient to his friend and chief,"
643,BOOK I.,"Patroclus led the fair Briseis forth,"
644,BOOK I.,And gave her to their hands; they to the ships
645,BOOK I.,"Retrac’d their steps, and with them the fair girl"
646,BOOK I.,"Reluctant went: meanwhile Achilles, plung’d"
647,BOOK I.,"In bitter grief, from all the band apart,"
648,BOOK I.,Upon the margin of the hoary sea
649,BOOK I.,Sat idly gazing on the dark-blue waves;
650,BOOK I.,"And to his Goddess-mother long he pray’d,"
651,BOOK I.,"With outstretch’d hands, “Oh, mother! since thy son"
652,BOOK I.,"To early death by destiny is doom’d,"
653,BOOK I.,"I might have hop’d the Thunderer on high,"
654,BOOK I.,"Olympian Jove, with honour would have crown’d"
655,BOOK I.,My little space; but now disgrace is mine;
656,BOOK I.,"Since Agamemnon, the wide-ruling King,"
657,BOOK I.,"Hath wrested from me, and still holds, my prize.”"
658,BOOK I.,
659,BOOK I.,"Weeping, he spoke; his Goddess-mother heard,"
660,BOOK I.,Beside her aged father where she sat
661,BOOK I.,In the deep ocean-caves: ascending quick
662,BOOK I.,"Through the dark waves, like to a misty cloud,"
663,BOOK I.,"Beside her son she stood; and as he wept,"
664,BOOK I.,"She gently touch’d him with her hand, and said,"
665,BOOK I.,“Why weeps my son? and whence his cause of grief?
666,BOOK I.,"Speak out, that I may hear, and share thy pain.”"
667,BOOK I.,
668,BOOK I.,"To whom Achilles, swift of foot, replied,"
669,BOOK I.,"Groaning, “Thou know’st; what boots to tell thee all?"
670,BOOK I.,"On Thebes we march’d, Eetion’s sacred town,"
671,BOOK I.,"And storm’d the walls, and hither bore the spoil."
672,BOOK I.,The spoils were fairly by the sons of Greece
673,BOOK I.,Apportion’d out; and to Atrides’ share
674,BOOK I.,The beauteous daughter of old Chryses fell.
675,BOOK I.,"Chryses, Apollo’s priest, to free his child,"
676,BOOK I.,"Came to th’ encampment of the brass-clad Greeks,"
677,BOOK I.,With costly ransom charg’d; and in his hand
678,BOOK I.,"The sacred fillet of his God he bore,"
679,BOOK I.,"And golden staff; to all he sued, but chief"
680,BOOK I.,"To Atreus’ sons, twin captains of the host."
681,BOOK I.,"Then through the ranks assenting murmurs ran,"
682,BOOK I.,"The priest to rev’rence, and the ransom take:"
683,BOOK I.,"Not so Atrides; he, with haughty mien"
684,BOOK I.,"And bitter words, the trembling sire dismiss’d."
685,BOOK I.,The old man turn’d in sorrow; but his pray’r
686,BOOK I.,"Phoebus Apollo heard, who lov’d him well."
687,BOOK I.,"Against the Greeks he bent his fatal bow,"
688,BOOK I.,And fast the people fell; on ev’ry side
689,BOOK I.,Throughout the camp the heav’nly arrows flew;
690,BOOK I.,A skilful seer at length the cause reveal’d
691,BOOK I.,"Why thus incens’d the Archer-God; I then,"
692,BOOK I.,"The first, gave counsel to appease his wrath."
693,BOOK I.,"Whereat Atrides, full of fury, rose,"
694,BOOK I.,"And utter’d threats, which he hath now fulfill’d."
695,BOOK I.,For Chryses’ daughter to her native land
696,BOOK I.,In a swift-sailing ship the keen-ey’d Greeks
697,BOOK I.,"Have sent, with costly off’rings to the God:"
698,BOOK I.,"But her, assign’d me by the sons of Greece,"
699,BOOK I.,"Brises’ fair daughter, from my tent e’en now"
700,BOOK I.,"The heralds bear away. Then, Goddess, thou,"
701,BOOK I.,"If thou hast pow’r, protect thine injur’d son."
702,BOOK I.,"Fly to Olympus, to the feet of Jove,"
703,BOOK I.,"And make thy pray’r to him, if on his heart"
704,BOOK I.,"Thou hast in truth, by word or deed, a claim."
705,BOOK I.,"For I remember, in my father’s house,"
706,BOOK I.,"I oft have heard thee boast, how thou, alone"
707,BOOK I.,"Of all th’ Immortals, Saturn’s cloud-girt son"
708,BOOK I.,"Didst shield from foul disgrace, when all the rest,"
709,BOOK I.,"Juno, and Neptune, and Minerva join’d,"
710,BOOK I.,"With chains to bind him; then, O Goddess, thou"
711,BOOK I.,"Didst set him free, invoking to his aid"
712,BOOK I.,"Him of the hundred arms, whom Briareus"
713,BOOK I.,"Th’ immortal Gods, and men Ægeon call."
714,BOOK I.,"He, mightier than his father, took his seat"
715,BOOK I.,"By Saturn’s side, in pride of conscious strength:"
716,BOOK I.,"Fear seiz’d on all the Gods, nor did they dare"
717,BOOK I.,"To bind their King: of this remind him now,"
718,BOOK I.,"And clasp his knees, and supplicate his aid"
719,BOOK I.,"For Troy’s brave warriors, that the routed Greeks"
720,BOOK I.,Back to their ships with slaughter may be driv’n;
721,BOOK I.,"That all may taste the folly of their King,"
722,BOOK I.,And Agamemnon’s haughty self may mourn
723,BOOK I.,The slight on Grecia’s bravest warrior cast.”
724,BOOK I.,
725,BOOK I.,"Thus he; and Thetis, weeping, thus replied:"
726,BOOK I.,"“Alas, my child, that e’er I gave thee birth!"
727,BOOK I.,Would that beside thy ships thou could’st remain
728,BOOK I.,"From grief exempt, and insult! since by fate"
729,BOOK I.,"Few years are thine, and not a lengthened term;"
730,BOOK I.,At once to early death and sorrows doom’d
731,BOOK I.,Beyond the lot of man! in evil hour
732,BOOK I.,I gave thee birth! But to the snow-clad heights
733,BOOK I.,"Of great Olympus, to the throne of Jove,"
734,BOOK I.,"Who wields the thunder, thy complaints I bear."
735,BOOK I.,"Thou by thy ships, meanwhile, against the Greeks"
736,BOOK I.,"Thine anger nurse, and from the fight abstain."
737,BOOK I.,For Jove is to a solemn banquet gone
738,BOOK I.,"Beyond the sea, on Æthiopia’s shore,"
739,BOOK I.,Since yesternight; and with him all the Gods.
740,BOOK I.,On the twelfth day he purpos’d to return
741,BOOK I.,"To high Olympus; thither then will I,"
742,BOOK I.,And to his feet my supplication make;
743,BOOK I.,"And he, I think, will not deny my suit.”"
744,BOOK I.,
745,BOOK I.,"This said, she disappear’d; and left him there"
746,BOOK I.,Musing in anger on the lovely form
747,BOOK I.,Tom from his arms by violence away.
748,BOOK I.,
749,BOOK I.,"Meantime, Ulysses, with his sacred freight,"
750,BOOK I.,Arriv’d at Chrysa’s strand; and when his bark
751,BOOK I.,"Had reach’d the shelter of the deep sea bay,"
752,BOOK I.,"Their sails they furl’d, and lower’d to the hold;"
753,BOOK I.,"Slack’d the retaining shrouds, and quickly struck"
754,BOOK I.,And stow’d away the mast; then with their sweeps
755,BOOK I.,"Pull’d for the beach, and cast their anchors out,"
756,BOOK I.,And made her fast with cables to the shore.
757,BOOK I.,Then on the shingly breakwater themselves
758,BOOK I.,"They landed, and the sacred hecatomb"
759,BOOK I.,To great Apollo; and Chryseis last.
760,BOOK I.,"Her to the altar straight Ulysses led,"
761,BOOK I.,The wise in counsel; in her father’s hand
762,BOOK I.,"He plac’d the maiden, and address’d him thus:"
763,BOOK I.,"“Chryses, from Agamemnon, King of men,"
764,BOOK I.,"To thee I come, thy daughter to restore;"
765,BOOK I.,"And to thy God, upon the Greeks’ behalf,"
766,BOOK I.,"To offer sacrifice, if haply so"
767,BOOK I.,"We may appease his wrath, who now incens’d"
768,BOOK I.,With grievous suff’ring visits all our host.”
769,BOOK I.,Then to her sire he gave her; he with joy
770,BOOK I.,Receiv’d his child; the sacred hecatomb
771,BOOK I.,Around the well-built altar for the God
772,BOOK I.,"In order due they plac’d; their hands then washed,"
773,BOOK I.,"And the salt cake prepar’d, before them all"
774,BOOK I.,With hands uplifted Chryses pray’d aloud:
775,BOOK I.,
776,BOOK I.,"“Hear me, God of the silver bow! whose care"
777,BOOK I.,"Chrysa surrounds, and Cilla’s lovely vale,"
778,BOOK I.,Whose sov’reign sway o’er Tenedos extends!
779,BOOK I.,"Once hast thou heard my pray’r, aveng’d my cause,"
780,BOOK I.,And pour’d thy fury on the Grecian host.
781,BOOK I.,"Hear yet again, and grant what now I ask;"
782,BOOK I.,"Withdraw thy chast’ning hand, and stay the plague.”"
783,BOOK I.,
784,BOOK I.,"Thus, as he pray’d, his pray’r Apollo heard."
785,BOOK I.,"Their pray’rs concluded, and the salt cake strew’d"
786,BOOK I.,"Upon the victims’ heads, they drew them back,"
787,BOOK I.,"And slew, and flay’d; then cutting from the thighs"
788,BOOK I.,"The choicest pieces, and in double layers"
789,BOOK I.,"O’erspreading them with fat, above them plac’d"
790,BOOK I.,The due meat-off’rings; then the aged priest
791,BOOK I.,"The cleft wood kindled, and libations pour’d"
792,BOOK I.,Of ruddy wine; arm’d with the five-fork’d prongs
793,BOOK I.,Th’ attendant ministers beside him stood.
794,BOOK I.,"The thighs consum’d with fire, the inward parts"
795,BOOK I.,They tasted first; the rest upon the spits
796,BOOK I.,"Roasted with care, and from the fire withdrew."
797,BOOK I.,"Their labours ended, and the feast prepar’d,"
798,BOOK I.,"They shared the social meal, nor lacked there aught."
799,BOOK I.,"The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,"
800,BOOK I.,"Th’ attendant youths the flowing goblets crown’d,"
801,BOOK I.,And in fit order serv’d the cups to all.
802,BOOK I.,"All day they sought the favour of the God,"
803,BOOK I.,"The glorious paeans chanting, and the praise"
804,BOOK I.,"Of Phoebus: he, well pleas’d, the strain receiv’d"
805,BOOK I.,"But when the sun was set, and shades of night"
806,BOOK I.,"O’erspread the sky, upon the sandy beach"
807,BOOK I.,Close to their ship they laid them down to rest.
808,BOOK I.,"And when the rosy-finger’d morn appear’d,"
809,BOOK I.,Back to the camp they took their homeward way
810,BOOK I.,A fav’ring breeze the Far-destroyer sent:
811,BOOK I.,"They stepp’d the mast, and spread the snowy sail:"
812,BOOK I.,Full in the midst the bellying sail receiv’d
813,BOOK I.,The gallant breeze; and round the vessel’s prow
814,BOOK I.,"The dark waves loudly roar’d, as on she rush’d"
815,BOOK I.,"Skimming the seas, and cut her wat’ry way."
816,BOOK I.,"Arriv’d where lay the wide-spread host of Greece,"
817,BOOK I.,Their dark-ribb’d vessel on the beach they drew
818,BOOK I.,"High on the sand, and strongly shor’d her up;"
819,BOOK I.,Then through the camp they took their sev’ral ways.
820,BOOK I.,
821,BOOK I.,"Meantime, beside the ships Achilles sat,"
822,BOOK I.,"The Heav’n-born son of Peleus, swift of foot,"
823,BOOK I.,Chafing with rage repress’d; no more he sought
824,BOOK I.,"The honour’d council, nor the battle-field;"
825,BOOK I.,"But wore his soul away, and inly pin’d"
826,BOOK I.,For the fierce joy and tumult of the fight.
827,BOOK I.,"But when the twelfth revolving day was come,"
828,BOOK I.,"Back to Olympus’ heights th’ immortal Gods,"
829,BOOK I.,"Jove at their head, together all return’d."
830,BOOK I.,"Then Thetis, mindful of her son’s request,"
831,BOOK I.,"Rose from the ocean wave, and sped in haste"
832,BOOK I.,"To high Olympus, and the courts of Heav’n."
833,BOOK I.,Th’ all-seeing son of Saturn there she found
834,BOOK I.,Sitting apart upon the topmost crest
835,BOOK I.,Of many-ridg’d Olympus; at his feet
836,BOOK I.,"She sat, and while her left hand clasp’d his knees,"
837,BOOK I.,"Her right approached his beard, and suppliant thus"
838,BOOK I.,She made her pray’r to Saturn’s royal son:
839,BOOK I.,
840,BOOK I.,"“Father, if e’er amid th’ immortal Gods"
841,BOOK I.,"By word or deed I did thee service true,"
842,BOOK I.,"Hear now my pray’r! Avenge my hapless son,"
843,BOOK I.,"Of mortals shortest-liv’d, insulted now"
844,BOOK I.,"By mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
845,BOOK I.,And plunder’d of his lawful spoils of war.
846,BOOK I.,"But Jove, Olympian, Lord of counsel, Thou"
847,BOOK I.,Avenge his cause; and give to Trojan arms
848,BOOK I.,"Such strength and pow’r, that Greeks may learn how much"
849,BOOK I.,"They need my son, and give him honour due.”"
850,BOOK I.,
851,BOOK I.,"She said: the Cloud-compeller answer’d not,"
852,BOOK I.,"But silent sat; then Thetis clasp’d his knees,"
853,BOOK I.,"And hung about him, and her suit renew’d:"
854,BOOK I.,
855,BOOK I.,"“Give me thy promise sure, thy gracious nod,"
856,BOOK I.,"Or else refuse (for thou hast none to fear),"
857,BOOK I.,"That I may learn, of all th’ immortal Gods,"
858,BOOK I.,How far I stand the lowest in thine eyes.”
859,BOOK I.,
860,BOOK I.,"Then, much disturb’d, the Cloud-compeller spoke:"
861,BOOK I.,"“Sad work thou mak’st, in bidding me oppose"
862,BOOK I.,"My will to Juno’s, when her bitter words"
863,BOOK I.,Assail me; for full oft amid the Gods
864,BOOK I.,"She taunts me, that I aid the Trojan cause."
865,BOOK I.,"But thou return, that Juno see thee not,"
866,BOOK I.,And leave to me the furth’rance of thy suit.
867,BOOK I.,"Lo, to confirm thy faith, I nod my head;"
868,BOOK I.,And well among th’ immortal Gods is known
869,BOOK I.,The solemn import of that pledge from me:
870,BOOK I.,"For ne’er my promise shall deceive, or fail,"
871,BOOK I.,"Or be recall’d, if with a nod confirm’d.”"
872,BOOK I.,
873,BOOK I.,"He said, and nodded with his shadowy brows;"
874,BOOK I.,"Wav’d on th’ immortal head th’ ambrosial locks,"
875,BOOK I.,And all Olympus trembled at his nod.
876,BOOK I.,They parted thus: from bright Olympus’ heights
877,BOOK I.,"The Goddess hasted to her ocean-caves,"
878,BOOK I.,Jove to his palace; at his entrance all
879,BOOK I.,Rose from their seats at once; not one presum’d
880,BOOK I.,"To wait his coming, but advanc’d to meet."
881,BOOK I.,Then on his throne he sat; but not unmark’d
882,BOOK I.,Of Juno’s eye had been the council held
883,BOOK I.,"In secret with the silver-footed Queen,"
884,BOOK I.,The daughter of the aged Ocean-God;
885,BOOK I.,And with sharp words she thus addressed her Lord:
886,BOOK I.,
887,BOOK I.,"“Tell me, deceiver, who was she with whom"
888,BOOK I.,Thou late held’st council? ever ’tis thy way
889,BOOK I.,"Apart from me to weave thy secret schemes,"
890,BOOK I.,Nor dost thou freely share with me thy mind.”
891,BOOK I.,
892,BOOK I.,To whom the Sire of Gods and men replied:
893,BOOK I.,"“Expect not, Juno, all my mind to know;"
894,BOOK I.,"My wife thou art, yet would such knowledge be"
895,BOOK I.,Too much for thee; whate’er I deem it fit
896,BOOK I.,"That thou shouldst know, nor God nor man shall hear"
897,BOOK I.,"Before thee; but what I in secret plan,"
898,BOOK I.,"Seek not to know, nor curiously inquire.”"
899,BOOK I.,
900,BOOK I.,Whom answer’d thus the stag-ey’d Queen of Heav’n:
901,BOOK I.,"“What words, dread son of Saturn, dost thou speak?"
902,BOOK I.,"Ne’er have I sought, or now, or heretofore,"
903,BOOK I.,Thy secret thoughts to know; what thou think’st fit
904,BOOK I.,"To tell, I wait thy gracious will to hear."
905,BOOK I.,Yet fear I in my soul thou art beguil’d
906,BOOK I.,"By wiles of Thetis, silver-footed Queen,"
907,BOOK I.,The daughter of the aged Ocean-God;
908,BOOK I.,"For she was with thee early, and embrac’d"
909,BOOK I.,"Thy knees, and has, I think, thy promise sure,"
910,BOOK I.,"Thou wilt avenge Achilles’ cause, and bring"
911,BOOK I.,Destructive slaughter on the Grecian host.”
912,BOOK I.,
913,BOOK I.,To whom the Cloud-compeller thus replied:
914,BOOK I.,"“Presumptuous, to thy busy thoughts thou giv’st"
915,BOOK I.,"Too free a range, and watchest all I do;"
916,BOOK I.,"Yet shalt thou not prevail, but rather thus"
917,BOOK I.,Be alien’d from my heart—the worse for thee!
918,BOOK I.,"If this be so, it is my sov’reign will."
919,BOOK I.,"But now, keep silence, and my words obey,"
920,BOOK I.,"Lest all th’ Immortals fail, if I be wroth,"
921,BOOK I.,To rescue thee from my resistless hand.”
922,BOOK I.,
923,BOOK I.,"He said, and terror seiz’d the stag-ey’d Queen:"
924,BOOK I.,"Silent she sat, curbing her spirit down,"
925,BOOK I.,And all the Gods in pitying sorrow mourn’d.
926,BOOK I.,"Vulcan, the skill’d artificer, then first"
927,BOOK I.,"Broke silence, and with soothing words address’d"
928,BOOK I.,"His mother, Juno, white-arm’d Queen of Heav’n:"
929,BOOK I.,"“Sad were’t, indeed, and grievous to be borne,"
930,BOOK I.,If for the sake of mortal men you two
931,BOOK I.,"Should suffer angry passions to arise,"
932,BOOK I.,And kindle broils in Heav’n; so should our feast
933,BOOK I.,By evil influence all its sweetness lack.
934,BOOK I.,Let me advise my mother (and I know
935,BOOK I.,That her own reason will my words approve)
936,BOOK I.,To speak my father fair; lest he again
937,BOOK I.,"Reply in anger, and our banquet mar."
938,BOOK I.,"For Jove, the lightning’s Lord, if such his will,"
939,BOOK I.,"Might hurl us from our seats (so great his pow’r),"
940,BOOK I.,But thou address him still with gentle words;
941,BOOK I.,So shall his favour soon again be ours.”
942,BOOK I.,
943,BOOK I.,"This said, he rose, and in his mother’s hand"
944,BOOK I.,"A double goblet plac’d, as thus he spoke:"
945,BOOK I.,"“Have patience, mother mine! though much enforc’d,"
946,BOOK I.,"Restrain thy spirit, lest perchance these eyes,"
947,BOOK I.,"Dear as thou art, behold thee brought to shame;"
948,BOOK I.,"And I, though griev’d in heart, be impotent"
949,BOOK I.,To save thee; for ’tis hard to strive with Jove.
950,BOOK I.,"When to thy succour once before I came,"
951,BOOK I.,"He seiz’d me by the foot, and hurl’d me down"
952,BOOK I.,"From Heav’n’s high threshold; all the day I fell,"
953,BOOK I.,"And with the setting sun, on Lemnos’ isle"
954,BOOK I.,"Lighted, scarce half alive; there was I found,"
955,BOOK I.,And by the Sintian people kindly nurs’d.”
956,BOOK I.,
957,BOOK I.,"Thus as he spoke, the white-armed Goddess smil’d,"
958,BOOK I.,"And, smiling, from, his hand receiv’d the cup,"
959,BOOK I.,"Then to th’ Immortals all, in order due,"
960,BOOK I.,"He minister’d, and from the flagon pour’d"
961,BOOK I.,The luscious nectar; while among the Gods
962,BOOK I.,"Rose laughter irrepressible, at sight"
963,BOOK I.,Of Vulcan hobbling round the spacious hall.
964,BOOK I.,
965,BOOK I.,Thus they till sunset pass’d the festive hours;
966,BOOK I.,"Nor lack’d the banquet aught to please the sense,"
967,BOOK I.,"Nor sound of tuneful lyre, by Phoebus touch’d,"
968,BOOK I.,"Nor Muses’ voice, who in alternate strains"
969,BOOK I.,"Responsive sang: but when the sun had set,"
970,BOOK I.,"Each to his home departed, where for each"
971,BOOK I.,"The crippled Vulcan, matchless architect,"
972,BOOK I.,With wondrous skill a noble house had rear’d.
973,BOOK I.,

1011,BOOK II.,"All night in sleep repos’d the other Gods,"

1013,BOOK II.,"Sweet slumber held not, pondering in his mind"
1014,BOOK II.,"How to avenge Achilles’ cause, and pour"
1015,BOOK II.,Destructive slaughter on the Grecian host.
1016,BOOK II.,"Thus as he mus’d, the wisest course appear’d"
1017,BOOK II.,By a deluding vision to mislead
1018,BOOK II.,The son of Atreus; and with winged words
1019,BOOK II.,Thus to a phantom form he gave command:
1020,BOOK II.,"“Hie thee, deluding Vision, to the camp"
1021,BOOK II.,"And ships of Greece, to Agamemnon’s tent;"
1022,BOOK II.,"There, changing nought, as I command thee, speak."
1023,BOOK II.,Bid that he arm in haste the long-hair’d Greeks
1024,BOOK II.,To combat; for the wide-built streets of Troy
1025,BOOK II.,He now may capture; since th’ immortal Gods
1026,BOOK II.,Watch over her no longer; all are gain’d
1027,BOOK II.,By Juno’s pray’rs; and woes impend o’er Troy.”
1028,BOOK II.,
1029,BOOK II.,"He said: the Vision heard, and straight obey’d:"
1030,BOOK II.,"Swiftly he sped, and reached the Grecian ships,"
1031,BOOK II.,And sought the son of Atreus; him he found
1032,BOOK II.,"Within his tent, wrapped in ambrosial sleep;"
1033,BOOK II.,"Above his head he stood, like Neleus’ son,"
1034,BOOK II.,"Nestor, whom Agamemnon rev’renc’d most"
1035,BOOK II.,Of all the Elders; in his likeness cloth’d
1036,BOOK II.,"Thus spoke the heav’nly Vision; “Sleep’st thou, son"

1038,BOOK II.,"To sleep all night but ill becomes a chief,"
1039,BOOK II.,"Charg’d with the public weal, and cares of state."
1040,BOOK II.,Hear now the words I bear; to thee I come

1048,BOOK II.,Bear this in mind; and when from sleep arous’d
1049,BOOK II.,Let not my words from thy remembrance fade.”
1050,BOOK II.,"This said, he vanish’d; and the monarch left,"
1051,BOOK II.,Inspir’d with thoughts which ne’er should come to pass.
1052,BOOK II.,For in that day he vainly hop’d to take
1053,BOOK II.,The town of Priam; ignorant what Jove
1054,BOOK II.,"Design’d in secret, or what woes, what groans,"
1055,BOOK II.,"What lengthen’d labours in the stubborn fight,"
1056,BOOK II.,Were yet for Trojans and for Greeks in store.
1057,BOOK II.,He woke from sleep; but o’er his senses spread
1058,BOOK II.,Dwelt still the heavenly voice; he sat upright;
1059,BOOK II.,"He donn’d his vest of texture fine, new-wrought,"
1060,BOOK II.,"Then o’er it threw his ample robe, and bound"
1061,BOOK II.,His sandals fair around his well-turn’d feet;
1062,BOOK II.,"And o’er his shoulders flung his sword, adorn’d"
1063,BOOK II.,With silver studs; and bearing in his hand
1064,BOOK II.,"His royal staff, ancestral, to the ships"
1065,BOOK II.,"Where lay the brass-clad warriors, bent his way."
1066,BOOK II.,
1067,BOOK II.,Aurora now was rising up the steep
1068,BOOK II.,"Of great Olympus, to th’ immortal Gods"
1069,BOOK II.,Pure light diffusing; when Atrides bade
1070,BOOK II.,The clear-voic’d heralds to th’ Assembly call
1071,BOOK II.,"The gen’ral host; they gave the word, and straight"
1072,BOOK II.,From ev’ry quarter throng’d the eager crowd.
1073,BOOK II.,"But first, of all the Elders, by the side"
1074,BOOK II.,"Of Nestor’s ship, the aged Pylian chief,"
1075,BOOK II.,A secret conclave Agamemnon call’d;
1076,BOOK II.,"And, prudent, thus the chosen few address’d:"
1077,BOOK II.,"“Hear me, my friends! In the still hours of night"
1078,BOOK II.,I saw a heav’nly Vision in my sleep:
1079,BOOK II.,"Most like it seemed in stature, form, and face"
1080,BOOK II.,"To rev’rend Nestor; at my head it stood,"
1081,BOOK II.,"And with these words address’d me—‘Sleep’st thou, son"
1082,BOOK II.,"Of Atreus, valiant warrior, horseman bold?"
1083,BOOK II.,"To sleep all night but ill becomes a chief,"
1084,BOOK II.,"Charg’d with the public weal, and cares of state."
1085,BOOK II.,Hear now the words I bear: to thee I come
1086,BOOK II.,"A messenger from Jove, who from on high"
1087,BOOK II.,Looks down on thee with eyes of pitying love.
1088,BOOK II.,He bids thee arm in haste the long-hair’d Greeks
1089,BOOK II.,To combat: since the wide-built streets of Troy
1090,BOOK II.,Thou now may’st capture; for th’ immortal Gods
1091,BOOK II.,Watch over her no longer: all are gain’d
1092,BOOK II.,"By Juno’s pray’rs, and woes impend o’er Troy."
1093,BOOK II.,Bear thou my words in mind.’ Thus as he spoke
1094,BOOK II.,He vanish’d; and sweet sleep forsook mine eyes.
1095,BOOK II.,Seek we then straight to arm the sons of Greece:
1096,BOOK II.,"But first, as is our wont, myself will prove"
1097,BOOK II.,The spirit of the army; and suggest
1098,BOOK II.,"Their homeward voyage; ye, throughout the camp"
1099,BOOK II.,"Restore their courage, and restrain from flight.”"
1100,BOOK II.,
1101,BOOK II.,"Thus having said, he sat; and next arose"
1102,BOOK II.,"Nestor, the chief of Pylos’ sandy shore."
1103,BOOK II.,"Who thus with prudent speech replied, and said:"
1104,BOOK II.,"“O friends, the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
1105,BOOK II.,"If any other had this Vision seen,"
1106,BOOK II.,"We should have deem’d it false, and laugh’d to scorn"
1107,BOOK II.,"The idle tale; but now it hath appear’d,"
1108,BOOK II.,"Of all our army, to the foremost man:"
1109,BOOK II.,Seek we then straight to arm the sons of Greece.”
1110,BOOK II.,
1111,BOOK II.,"He said, and from the council led the way."
1112,BOOK II.,"Uprose the sceptred monarchs, and obey’d"
1113,BOOK II.,"Their leader’s call, and round them throng’d the crowd."
1114,BOOK II.,"As swarms of bees, that pour in ceaseless stream"
1115,BOOK II.,"From out the crevice of some hollow rock,"
1116,BOOK II.,"Now clust’ring, and anon ’mid vernal flow’rs,"
1117,BOOK II.,"Some here, some there, in busy numbers fly;"
1118,BOOK II.,So to th’ Assembly from their tents and ships
1119,BOOK II.,"The countless tribes came thronging; in their midst,"
1120,BOOK II.,"By Jove enkindled, Rumour urged them on."
1121,BOOK II.,Great was the din; and as the mighty mass
1122,BOOK II.,"Sat down, the solid earth beneath them groan’d;"
1123,BOOK II.,"Nine heralds rais’d their voices loud, to quell"
1124,BOOK II.,"The storm of tongues, and bade the noisy crowd"
1125,BOOK II.,"Be still, and listen to the Heav’n-born Kings."
1126,BOOK II.,
1127,BOOK II.,"At length they all were seated, and awhile"
1128,BOOK II.,Their clamours sank to silence; then uprose
1129,BOOK II.,"The monarch Agamemnon, in his hand"
1130,BOOK II.,"His royal staff, the work of Vulcan’s art;"
1131,BOOK II.,Which Vulcan to the son of Saturn gave;
1132,BOOK II.,"To Hermes he, the heav’nly messenger;"
1133,BOOK II.,"Hermes to Pelops, matchless charioteer;"
1134,BOOK II.,Pelops to Atreus; Atreus at his death
1135,BOOK II.,"Bequeath’d it to Thyestes, wealthy Lord"
1136,BOOK II.,Of num’rous herds; to Agamemnon last
1137,BOOK II.,Thyestes left it; token of his sway
1138,BOOK II.,"O’er all the Argive coast, and neighbouring isles."
1139,BOOK II.,"On this the monarch leant, as thus he spoke:"
1140,BOOK II.,"“Friends, Grecian Heroes, Ministers of Mars!"
1141,BOOK II.,"Grievous, and all unlook’d for, is the blow"
1142,BOOK II.,Which Jove hath dealt me; by his promise led
1143,BOOK II.,"I hop’d to raze the strong-built walls of Troy,"
1144,BOOK II.,And home return in safety; but it seems
1145,BOOK II.,"He falsifies his word, and bids me now"
1146,BOOK II.,"Return to Argos, frustrate of my hope,"
1147,BOOK II.,"Dishonour’d, and with grievous loss of men."
1148,BOOK II.,Such now appears th’ o’er-ruling sov’reign will
1149,BOOK II.,Of Saturn’s son; who oft hath sunk the heads
1150,BOOK II.,"Of many a lofty city in the dust,"
1151,BOOK II.,And yet will sink; for mighty is his hand.
1152,BOOK II.,’Tis shame indeed that future days should hear
1153,BOOK II.,"How such a force as ours, so great, so brave,"
1154,BOOK II.,"Hath thus been baffled, fighting, as we do,"
1155,BOOK II.,"’Gainst numbers far inferior to our own,"
1156,BOOK II.,And see no end of all our warlike toil.
1157,BOOK II.,"For should we choose, on terms of plighted truce,"
1158,BOOK II.,"Trojans and Greeks, to number our array;"
1159,BOOK II.,"Of Trojans, all that dwell within the town,"
1160,BOOK II.,"And we, by tens disposed, to every ten,"
1161,BOOK II.,"To crown our cups, one Trojan should assign,"
1162,BOOK II.,Full many a ten no cupbearer would find:
1163,BOOK II.,So far the sons of Greece outnumber all
1164,BOOK II.,That dwell within the town; but to their aid
1165,BOOK II.,"Bold warriors come from all the cities round,"
1166,BOOK II.,"Who greatly harass me, and render vain"
1167,BOOK II.,My hope to storm the strong-built walls of Troy.
1168,BOOK II.,Already now nine weary years have pass’d;
1169,BOOK II.,"The timbers of our ships are all decay’d,"
1170,BOOK II.,The cordage rotted; in our homes the while
1171,BOOK II.,"Our wives and helpless children sit, in vain"
1172,BOOK II.,"Expecting our return; and still the work,"
1173,BOOK II.,"For which we hither came, remains undone."
1174,BOOK II.,Hear then my counsel; let us all agree
1175,BOOK II.,"Home to direct our course, since here in vain"
1176,BOOK II.,We strive to take the well-built walls of Troy.”
1177,BOOK II.,
1178,BOOK II.,"Thus as he spoke, the crowd, that had not heard"
1179,BOOK II.,"The secret council, by his words was mov’d;"
1180,BOOK II.,"So sway’d and heav’d the multitude, as when"
1181,BOOK II.,O’er the vast billows of th’ Icarian sea
1182,BOOK II.,Eurus and Notus from the clouds of Heav’n
1183,BOOK II.,Pour forth their fury; or as some deep field
1184,BOOK II.,"Of wavy corn, when sweeping o’er the plain"
1185,BOOK II.,The ruffling west wind sways the bending ears;
1186,BOOK II.,So was th’ Assembly stirr’d; and tow’rd the ships
1187,BOOK II.,"With clam’rous joy they rush’d; beneath, their feet"
1188,BOOK II.,"Rose clouds of dust, while one to other call’d"
1189,BOOK II.,To seize the ships and drag them to the main.
1190,BOOK II.,"They clear’d the channels, and with shouts of “home”"
1191,BOOK II.,"That rose to Heav’n, they knock’d the shores away."
1192,BOOK II.,"Then had the Greeks in shameful flight withdrawn,"
1193,BOOK II.,Had Juno not to Pallas thus appeal’d:
1194,BOOK II.,"“Oh Heav’n! brave child of aegis-bearing Jove,"
1195,BOOK II.,"Shall thus the Greeks, in ignominious flight,"
1196,BOOK II.,"O’er the wide sea their homeward course pursue,"
1197,BOOK II.,And as a trophy to the sons of Troy
1198,BOOK II.,"The Argive Helen leave, on whose account,"
1199,BOOK II.,"Far from their home, so many valiant Greeks"
1200,BOOK II.,Have cast their lives away? Go quickly thou
1201,BOOK II.,"Amid the brass-clad Greeks, and man by man"
1202,BOOK II.,"Address with words persuasive, nor permit"
1203,BOOK II.,To launch their well-trimm’d vessels on the deep.”
1204,BOOK II.,
1205,BOOK II.,"She said, nor did Minerva not obey,"
1206,BOOK II.,But swift descending from Olympus’ heights
1207,BOOK II.,With rapid flight she reach’d the Grecian ships.
1208,BOOK II.,"Laertes’ son, in council sage as Jove"
1209,BOOK II.,There found she standing; he no hand had laid
1210,BOOK II.,"On his dark vessel, for with bitter grief"
1211,BOOK II.,"His heart was filled; the blue-ey’d Maid approach’d,"
1212,BOOK II.,"And thus address’d him: “Great Laertes’ son,"
1213,BOOK II.,"Ulysses, sage in council, can it be"
1214,BOOK II.,"That you, the men of Greece, embarking thus"
1215,BOOK II.,"On your swift ships, in ignominious flight,"
1216,BOOK II.,"O’er the wide sea will take your homeward way,"
1217,BOOK II.,And as a trophy to the sons of Troy
1218,BOOK II.,"The Argive Helen leave, on whose account"
1219,BOOK II.,Far from their homes so many valiant Greeks
1220,BOOK II.,Have cast their lives away? Go quickly thou
1221,BOOK II.,"Among the multitude, and man by man"
1222,BOOK II.,"Address with words persuasive, nor permit"
1223,BOOK II.,To launch their well-trimm’d vessels on the deep.”
1224,BOOK II.,
1225,BOOK II.,She said; the heav’nly voice Ulysses knew;
1226,BOOK II.,"Straight, springing to the course, he cast aside,"
1227,BOOK II.,"And to Eurybates of Ithaca,"
1228,BOOK II.,"His herald and attendant, threw his robe;"
1229,BOOK II.,"Then to Atrides hasten’d, and by him"
1230,BOOK II.,"Arm’d with his royal staff ancestral, pass’d"
1231,BOOK II.,With rapid step amid the ships of Greece.
1232,BOOK II.,Each King or leader whom he found he thus
1233,BOOK II.,With cheering words encourag’d and restrain’d:
1234,BOOK II.,"“O gallant friend, ’tis not for thee to yield,"
1235,BOOK II.,"Like meaner men, to panic; but thyself"
1236,BOOK II.,"Sit quiet, and the common herd restrain."
1237,BOOK II.,Thou know’st not yet Atrides’ secret mind:
1238,BOOK II.,"He tries us now, and may reprove us soon."
1239,BOOK II.,His words in council reach’d not all our ears:
1240,BOOK II.,See that he work us not some ill; for fierce
1241,BOOK II.,"His anger; and the Lord of counsel, Jove,"
1242,BOOK II.,"From whom proceeds all honour, loves him well.”"
1243,BOOK II.,
1244,BOOK II.,But of the common herd whome’er he found
1245,BOOK II.,"Clam’ring, he check’d with staff and threat’ning words:"
1246,BOOK II.,"“Good friend, keep still, and hear what others say,"
1247,BOOK II.,"Thy betters far: for thou art good for nought,"
1248,BOOK II.,Of small account in council or in fight.
1249,BOOK II.,All are not sovereigns here: ill fares the state
1250,BOOK II.,"Where many masters rule; let one be Lord,"
1251,BOOK II.,One King supreme; to whom wise Saturn’s son
1252,BOOK II.,In token of his sov’reign power hath giv’n
1253,BOOK II.,The sceptre’s sway and ministry of law.”
1254,BOOK II.,
1255,BOOK II.,"Such were his words, as through the ranks he pass’d:"
1256,BOOK II.,They from the vessels and the tents again
1257,BOOK II.,"Throng’d to th’ Assembly, with such rush of sound,"
1258,BOOK II.,As when the many-dashing ocean’s wave
1259,BOOK II.,"Breaks on the shore, and foams the frothing sea."
1260,BOOK II.,The others all were settled in their seats:
1261,BOOK II.,"Only Thersites, with unmeasur’d words,"
1262,BOOK II.,"Of which he had good store, to rate the chiefs,"
1263,BOOK II.,"Not over-seemly, but wherewith he thought"
1264,BOOK II.,"To move the crowd to laughter, brawl’d aloud."
1265,BOOK II.,The ugliest man was he who came to Troy:
1266,BOOK II.,"With squinting eyes, and one distorted foot,"
1267,BOOK II.,"His shoulders round, and buried in his breast"
1268,BOOK II.,"His narrow head, with scanty growth of hair."
1269,BOOK II.,Against Achilles and Ulysses most
1270,BOOK II.,His hate was turn’d; on them his venom pour’d;
1271,BOOK II.,"Anon, at Agamemnon’s self he launch’d"
1272,BOOK II.,His loud-tongued ribaldry; ’gainst him he knew
1273,BOOK II.,"Incensed the public mind; and bawling loud,[1]"
1274,BOOK II.,"With scurril words, he thus address’d the King:"
1275,BOOK II.,"“What more, thou son of Atreus, would’st thou have?"
1276,BOOK II.,Thy tents are full of brass; and in those tents
1277,BOOK II.,"Many fair women, whom, from all the spoil,"
1278,BOOK II.,"We Greeks, whene’er some wealthy town we take,"
1279,BOOK II.,"Choose first of all, and set apart for thee."
1280,BOOK II.,"Or dost thou thirst for gold, which here perchance"
1281,BOOK II.,"Some Trojan brings, the ransom of his son"
1282,BOOK II.,"Captur’d by me, or by some other Greek?"
1283,BOOK II.,"Or some new girl, to gratify thy lust,"
1284,BOOK II.,"Kept for thyself apart? a leader, thou"
1285,BOOK II.,Shouldst not to evil lead the sons of Greece.
1286,BOOK II.,Ye slaves! ye coward souls! Women of Greece!
1287,BOOK II.,I will not call you men! why go we not
1288,BOOK II.,"Home with our ships, and leave this mighty chief"
1289,BOOK II.,"To gloat upon his treasures, and find out"
1290,BOOK II.,"Whether in truth he need our aid, or no;"
1291,BOOK II.,"Who on Achilles, his superior far,"
1292,BOOK II.,"Foul scorn hath cast, and robb’d him of his prize,"
1293,BOOK II.,"Which for himself he keeps? Achilles, sure,"
1294,BOOK II.,"Is not intemperate, but mild of mood;"
1295,BOOK II.,"Else, Atreus’ son, this insult were thy last.”"
1296,BOOK II.,
1297,BOOK II.,"On Agamemnon, leader of the host,"
1298,BOOK II.,With words like these Thersites pour’d his hate;
1299,BOOK II.,"But straight Ulysses at his side appear’d,"
1300,BOOK II.,"And spoke, with scornful glance, in stern rebuke:"
1301,BOOK II.,"“Thou babbling fool, Thersites, prompt of speech,"
1302,BOOK II.,"Restrain thy tongue, nor singly thus presume"
1303,BOOK II.,"The Kings to slander; thou, the meanest far"
1304,BOOK II.,Of all that with the Atridae came to Troy.
1305,BOOK II.,"Ill it beseems, that such an one as thou"
1306,BOOK II.,"Should lift thy voice against the Kings, and rail"
1307,BOOK II.,"With scurril ribaldry, and prate of home."
1308,BOOK II.,"How these affairs may end, we know not yet;"
1309,BOOK II.,"Nor how, or well or ill, we may return."
1310,BOOK II.,"Cease then against Atrides, King of men,"
1311,BOOK II.,"To pour thy spite, for that the valiant Greeks"
1312,BOOK II.,"To him, despite thy railing, as of right"
1313,BOOK II.,An ample portion of the spoils assign.
1314,BOOK II.,"But this I tell thee, and will make it good,"
1315,BOOK II.,"If e’er I find thee play the fool, as now,"
1316,BOOK II.,"Then may these shoulders cease this head to bear,"
1317,BOOK II.,And may my son Telemachus no more
1318,BOOK II.,"Own me his father, if I strip not off"
1319,BOOK II.,"Thy mantle and thy garments, aye, expose"
1320,BOOK II.,"Thy nakedness, and flog thee to the ships"
1321,BOOK II.,"Howling, and scourg’d with ignominious stripes.”"
1322,BOOK II.,
1323,BOOK II.,"Thus as he spoke, upon Thersites’ neck"
1324,BOOK II.,And back came down his heavy staff; the wretch
1325,BOOK II.,"Shrank from the blow, and scalding tears let fall."
1326,BOOK II.,"Where struck the golden-studded staff, appear’d"
1327,BOOK II.,"A bloody weal: Thersites quail’d, and down,"
1328,BOOK II.,"Quiv’ring with pain, he sat, and wip’d away."
1329,BOOK II.,"With horrible grimace, the trickling tears."
1330,BOOK II.,"The Greeks, despite their anger, laugh’d aloud,"
1331,BOOK II.,"And one to other said, “Good faith, of all"
1332,BOOK II.,"The many works Ulysses well hath done,"
1333,BOOK II.,"Wise in the council, foremost in the fight,"
1334,BOOK II.,"He ne’er hath done a better, than when now"
1335,BOOK II.,He makes this scurril babbler hold his peace.
1336,BOOK II.,Methinks his headstrong spirit will not soon
1337,BOOK II.,Lead him again to vilify the Kings.”
1338,BOOK II.,
1339,BOOK II.,"Thus spoke the gen’ral voice: but, staff in hand,"
1340,BOOK II.,"Ulysses rose; Minerva by his side,"
1341,BOOK II.,"In likeness of a herald, bade the crowd"
1342,BOOK II.,"Keep silence, that the Greeks, from first to last,"
1343,BOOK II.,"Might hear his words, and ponder his advice."
1344,BOOK II.,He thus with prudent phrase his speech began:
1345,BOOK II.,"“Great son of Atreus, on thy name, O King,"
1346,BOOK II.,"Throughout the world will foul reproach be cast,"
1347,BOOK II.,"If Greeks forget their promise, nor make good"
1348,BOOK II.,"The vow they took to thee, when hitherward"
1349,BOOK II.,"We sailed from Argos’ grassy plains, to raze,"
1350,BOOK II.,"Ere our return, the well-built walls of Troy."
1351,BOOK II.,"But now, like helpless widows, or like babes,"
1352,BOOK II.,"They mourn their cruel fate, and pine for home."
1353,BOOK II.,’Tis hard indeed defeated to return;
1354,BOOK II.,"The seaman murmurs, if from wife and home,"
1355,BOOK II.,"Ev’n for one month, his well-found bark be stay’d,"
1356,BOOK II.,Toss’d by the wint’ry blasts and stormy sea;
1357,BOOK II.,But us the ninth revolving year beholds
1358,BOOK II.,Still ling’ring here: I cannot therefore blame
1359,BOOK II.,"Our valiant Greeks, if by the ships I hear"
1360,BOOK II.,Their murmurs; yet ’twere surely worst of all
1361,BOOK II.,"Long to remain, and bootless to return."
1362,BOOK II.,"Bear up, my friends, remain awhile, and see"
1363,BOOK II.,"If Calchas truly prophesy, or no."
1364,BOOK II.,"For this ye all have seen, and can yourselves"
1365,BOOK II.,"Bear witness, all who yet are spar’d by fate,"
1366,BOOK II.,"Not long ago, when ships of Greece were met"
1367,BOOK II.,"At Aulis, charg’d with evil freight for Troy,"
1368,BOOK II.,"And we, around a fountain, to the Gods"
1369,BOOK II.,"Our altars rear’d, with faultless hecatombs,"
1370,BOOK II.,"Near a fair plane-tree, where bright water flow’d,"
1371,BOOK II.,Behold a wonder! by Olympian Jove
1372,BOOK II.,"Sent forth to light, a snake, with burnish’d scales,"
1373,BOOK II.,"Of aspect fearful, issuing from beneath"
1374,BOOK II.,"The altars, glided to the plane-tree straight."
1375,BOOK II.,"There, on the topmost bough, beneath the leaves"
1376,BOOK II.,"Cow’ring, a sparrow’s callow nestlings lay;"
1377,BOOK II.,"Eight fledglings, and the parent bird the ninth."
1378,BOOK II.,"All the eight nestlings, utt’ring piercing cries,"
1379,BOOK II.,"The snake devour’d; and as the mother flew,"
1380,BOOK II.,"Lamenting o’er her offspring, round and round,"
1381,BOOK II.,"Uncoiling, caught her, shrieking, by the wing."
1382,BOOK II.,"Then, when the sparrow’s nestlings and herself"
1383,BOOK II.,"The snake had swallowed, by the God, who first"
1384,BOOK II.,"Sent him to light, a miracle was wrought:"
1385,BOOK II.,"For Jove, the deep-designing Saturn’s son,"
1386,BOOK II.,"Turn’d him to stone; we stood, and wond’ring gaz’d."
1387,BOOK II.,"But when this prodigy befell our rites,"
1388,BOOK II.,"Calchas, inspir’d of Heaven, took up his speech:"
1389,BOOK II.,"‘Ye long-haired sons of Greece, why stand ye thus"
1390,BOOK II.,"In mute amaze? to us Olympian Jove,"
1391,BOOK II.,"To whom be endless praise, vouchsafes this sign,"
1392,BOOK II.,"Late sent, of late fulfilment: as ye saw"
1393,BOOK II.,"The snake devour the sparrow and her young,"
1394,BOOK II.,"Eight nestlings, and the parent bird the ninth:"
1395,BOOK II.,"So, for so many years, are we condemn’d"
1396,BOOK II.,To wage a fruitless war; but in the tenth
1397,BOOK II.,The wide-built city shall at last be ours.’
1398,BOOK II.,"Thus he foretold, and now the time is come."
1399,BOOK II.,"Here then, ye well-greav’d Greeks, let all remain,"
1400,BOOK II.,Till Priam’s wealthy city be our own.”
1401,BOOK II.,
1402,BOOK II.,"He said, and loudly cheer’d the Greeks—and loud"
1403,BOOK II.,From all the hollow ships came back the cheers—
1404,BOOK II.,In admiration of Ulysses’ speech.
1405,BOOK II.,Gerenian Nestor next took up the word:
1406,BOOK II.,"“Like children, Grecian warriors, ye debate;"
1407,BOOK II.,Like babes to whom unknown are feats of arms.
1408,BOOK II.,"Where then are now our solemn covenants,"
1409,BOOK II.,"Our plighted oaths? Go, cast we to the fire"
1410,BOOK II.,"Our councils held, our warriors’ plans matur’d,"
1411,BOOK II.,"Our absolute pledges, and our hand-plight giv’n,"
1412,BOOK II.,In which our trust was placed; since thus in vain
1413,BOOK II.,"In words we wrangle, and how long soe’er"
1414,BOOK II.,"We here remain, solution none we find."
1415,BOOK II.,"Atrides, thou, as is thy wont, maintain"
1416,BOOK II.,Unchang’d thy counsel; for the stubborn fight
1417,BOOK II.,Array the Greeks; and let perdition seize
1418,BOOK II.,"Those few, those two or three among the host,"
1419,BOOK II.,Who hold their separate counsel—(not on them
1420,BOOK II.,Depends the issue!)—rather than return
1421,BOOK II.,"To Argos, ere we prove if Jove indeed"
1422,BOOK II.,"Will falsify his promis’d word, or no."
1423,BOOK II.,"For well I ween, that on the day when first"
1424,BOOK II.,"We Grecians hitherward our course address’d,"
1425,BOOK II.,"To Troy the messengers of blood and death,"
1426,BOOK II.,"Th’ o’er-ruling son of Saturn, on our right"
1427,BOOK II.,"His lightning flashing, with auspicious sign"
1428,BOOK II.,Assur’d us of his favour; let not then
1429,BOOK II.,"The thoughts of home be breath’d, ere Trojan wives"
1430,BOOK II.,"Given to our warriors, retribution pay"
1431,BOOK II.,"For wrongs by us, in Helen’s cause, sustain’d."
1432,BOOK II.,"But whoso longs, if such an one there be,"
1433,BOOK II.,"To make his homeward voyage, let him take"
1434,BOOK II.,"His well-rigg’d bark, and go; before the rest"
1435,BOOK II.,"To meet the doom of death! But thou, O King!"
1436,BOOK II.,"Be well advis’d thyself, and others lead"
1437,BOOK II.,By wholesome counsel; for the words I speak
1438,BOOK II.,"Are not to be despis’d; by tribes and clans,"
1439,BOOK II.,"O Agamemnon! range thy troops, that so"
1440,BOOK II.,"Tribe may to tribe give aid, and clan to clan."
1441,BOOK II.,"If thus thou do, and Greeks thy words obey,"
1442,BOOK II.,"Then shalt thou see, of chiefs and troops alike,"
1443,BOOK II.,The good and bad; for on their own behoof
1444,BOOK II.,"They all shall fight; and if thou fail, shalt know"
1445,BOOK II.,"Whether thy failure be of Heav’n’s decree,"
1446,BOOK II.,Or man’s default and ignorance of war.”
1447,BOOK II.,
1448,BOOK II.,To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus:
1449,BOOK II.,"“Father, in council, of the sons of Greece,"
1450,BOOK II.,None can compare with thee; and would to Jove
1451,BOOK II.,"To Pallas, and Apollo, at my side"
1452,BOOK II.,I had but ten such counsellors as thee!
1453,BOOK II.,"Then soon should royal Priam’s city fall,"
1454,BOOK II.,Tak’n and destroy’d by our victorious hands.
1455,BOOK II.,"But now on me hath aegis-bearing Jove,"
1456,BOOK II.,"The son of Saturn, fruitless toil impos’d,"
1457,BOOK II.,And hurtful quarrels; for in wordy war
1458,BOOK II.,"About a girl, Achilles and myself"
1459,BOOK II.,"Engag’d; and I, alas! the strife began:"
1460,BOOK II.,"Could we be friends again, delay were none,"
1461,BOOK II.,"How short soe’er, of Ilium’s final doom."
1462,BOOK II.,"But now to breakfast, ere we wage the fight."
1463,BOOK II.,"Each sharpen well his spear, his shield prepare,"
1464,BOOK II.,"Each to his fiery steeds their forage give,"
1465,BOOK II.,"Each look his chariot o’er, that through the day"
1466,BOOK II.,We may unwearied stem the tide of war;
1467,BOOK II.,"For respite none, how short soe’er, shall be"
1468,BOOK II.,Till night shall bid the storm of battle cease.
1469,BOOK II.,With sweat shall reek upon each warrior’s breast
1470,BOOK II.,The leathern belt beneath the cov’ring shield;
1471,BOOK II.,And hands shall ache that wield the pond’rous spear:
1472,BOOK II.,With sweat shall reek the fiery steeds that draw
1473,BOOK II.,Each warrior’s car; but whomsoe’er I find
1474,BOOK II.,"Loit’ring beside the beaked ships, for him"
1475,BOOK II.,’Twere hard to’scape the vultures and the dogs.”
1476,BOOK II.,
1477,BOOK II.,He said; and from th’ applauding ranks of Greece
1478,BOOK II.,"Rose a loud sound, as when the ocean wave,"
1479,BOOK II.,"Driv’n by the south wind on some lofty beach,"
1480,BOOK II.,"Dashes against a prominent crag, expos’d"
1481,BOOK II.,To blasts from every storm that roars around.
1482,BOOK II.,"Uprising then, and through the camp dispers’d"
1483,BOOK II.,"They took their sev’ral ways, and by their tents"
1484,BOOK II.,"The fires they lighted, and the meal prepar’d;"
1485,BOOK II.,And each to some one of the Immortal Gods
1486,BOOK II.,"His off’ring made, that in the coming fight"
1487,BOOK II.,He might escape the bitter doom of death.
1488,BOOK II.,"But to the o’erruling son of Saturn, Jove,"
1489,BOOK II.,"A sturdy ox, well-fatten’d, five years old,"
1490,BOOK II.,Atrides slew; and to the banquet call’d
1491,BOOK II.,The aged chiefs and councillors of Greece;
1492,BOOK II.,"Nestor the first, the King Idomeneus,"
1493,BOOK II.,"The two Ajaces next, and Tydeus’ son,"
1494,BOOK II.,"Ulysses sixth, as Jove in council sage."
1495,BOOK II.,"But uninvited Menelaus came,"
1496,BOOK II.,Knowing what cares upon his brother press’d.
1497,BOOK II.,"Around the ox they stood, and on his head"
1498,BOOK II.,The salt cake sprinkled; then amid them all
1499,BOOK II.,The monarch Agamemnon pray’d aloud:
1500,BOOK II.,"“Most great, most glorious Jove! who dwell’st on high,"
1501,BOOK II.,"In clouds and darkness veil’d, grant Thou that ere"
1502,BOOK II.,"This sun shall set, and night o’erspread the earth,"
1503,BOOK II.,I may the haughty walls of Priam’s house
1504,BOOK II.,Lay prostrate in the dust; and burn with fire
1505,BOOK II.,His lofty gates; and strip from Hector’s breast
1506,BOOK II.,"His sword-rent tunic, while around his corpse"
1507,BOOK II.,"Many brave comrades, prostrate, bite the dust.”"
1508,BOOK II.,
1509,BOOK II.,Thus he; but Saturn’s son his pray’r denied;
1510,BOOK II.,"Receiv’d his off’rings, but his toils increas’d."
1511,BOOK II.,"Their pray’rs concluded, and the salt cake strewed"
1512,BOOK II.,"Upon the victim’s head, they drew him back,"
1513,BOOK II.,"And slew, and flay’d; then cutting from the thighs"
1514,BOOK II.,"The choicest pieces, and in double layers"
1515,BOOK II.,"O’erspreading them with fat, above them plac’d"
1516,BOOK II.,The due meat-off’rings; these they burnt with logs
1517,BOOK II.,"Of leafless timber; and the inward parts,"
1518,BOOK II.,"First to be tasted, o’er the fire they held."
1519,BOOK II.,"The thighs consum’d with fire, the inward parts"
1520,BOOK II.,They tasted first; the rest upon the spits
1521,BOOK II.,"Roasted with care, and from the fire withdrew."
1522,BOOK II.,"Their labours ended, and the feast prepar’d,"
1523,BOOK II.,"They shared the social meal, nor lacked there aught."
1524,BOOK II.,"The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,"
1525,BOOK II.,Gerenian Nestor thus his speech began:
1526,BOOK II.,"“Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
1527,BOOK II.,"Great Atreus’ son, no longer let us pause,"
1528,BOOK II.,The work delaying which the pow’rs of Heav’n
1529,BOOK II.,Have trusted to our hands; do thou forthwith
1530,BOOK II.,"Bid that the heralds proclamation make,"
1531,BOOK II.,And summon through the camp the brass-clad Greeks;
1532,BOOK II.,"While, in a body, through the wide-spread ranks"
1533,BOOK II.,"We pass, and stimulate their warlike zeal.”"
1534,BOOK II.,
1535,BOOK II.,"He said; and Agamemnon, King of men,"
1536,BOOK II.,"Obedient to his counsel, gave command"
1537,BOOK II.,That to the war the clear-voic’d heralds call
1538,BOOK II.,"The long-hair’d Greeks: they gave the word, and straight"
1539,BOOK II.,From ev’ry quarter throng’d the eager crowd.
1540,BOOK II.,"The Heav’n-born Kings, encircling Atreus’ son,"
1541,BOOK II.,"The troops inspected: Pallas, blue-ey’d Maid,"
1542,BOOK II.,"Before the chiefs her glorious aegis bore,"

1921,BOOK II.,"A scion true of Mars, Leonteus, heir"
1922,BOOK II.,"Of nobly-born Coronus, Caeneus’ son."
1923,BOOK II.,In their command came forty dark-ribb’d ships.
1924,BOOK II.,
1925,BOOK II.,With two and twenty vessels Gouneus came
1926,BOOK II.,"From Cythus; he the Enienes led,"
1927,BOOK II.,"And the Peraebians’ warlike tribes, and those"
1928,BOOK II.,"Who dwelt around Dodona’s wintry heights,"
1929,BOOK II.,Or till’d the soil upon the lovely banks
1930,BOOK II.,"Of Titaresius, who to Peneus pours"
1931,BOOK II.,The tribute of his clearly-flowing stream;
1932,BOOK II.,"Yet mingles not with Peneus’ silver waves,"
1933,BOOK II.,"But on the surface floats like oil, his source"
1934,BOOK II.,"From Styx deriving, in whose awful name"
1935,BOOK II.,Both Gods and men by holiest oaths are bound.
1936,BOOK II.,
1937,BOOK II.,"Magnesia’s troops, who dwelt by Peneus’ stream,"
1938,BOOK II.,"Or beneath Pelion’s leafy-quiv’ring shades,"
1939,BOOK II.,"Swift-footed Prothous led, Tenthredon’s son;"
1940,BOOK II.,In his command came forty dark-ribb’d ships.
1941,BOOK II.,
1942,BOOK II.,These were the leaders and the chiefs of Greece:
1943,BOOK II.,"Say, Muse, of these, who with th’ Atridae came,"
1944,BOOK II.,"Horses and men, who claim’d the highest praise."
1945,BOOK II.,"Of steeds, the bravest and the noblest far"
1946,BOOK II.,"Were those Eumelus drove, Admetus’ son:"
1947,BOOK II.,"Both swift as birds, in age and colour match’d,"
1948,BOOK II.,"Alike in height, as measur’d o’er the back;"
1949,BOOK II.,"Both mares, by Phoebus of the silver bow"
1950,BOOK II.,"Rear’d in Pieria, thunderbolts of war."
1951,BOOK II.,"Of men, while yet Achilles held his wrath,"
1952,BOOK II.,The mightiest far was Ajax Telamon.
1953,BOOK II.,"For with Achilles, and the steeds that bore"
1954,BOOK II.,"The matchless son of Peleus, none might vie:"
1955,BOOK II.,But ’mid his beaked ocean-going ships
1956,BOOK II.,"He lay, with Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,"
1957,BOOK II.,Indignant; while his troops upon the beach
1958,BOOK II.,"With quoits and jav’lins whil’d away the day,"
1959,BOOK II.,And feats of archery; their steeds the while
1960,BOOK II.,"The lotus-grass and marsh-grown parsley cropp’d,"
1961,BOOK II.,Each standing near their car; the well-wrought cars
1962,BOOK II.,Lay all unheeded in the warriors’ tents;
1963,BOOK II.,"They, inly pining for their godlike chief,"
1964,BOOK II.,"Roam’d listless up and down, nor join’d the fray."
1965,BOOK II.,
1966,BOOK II.,"Such was the host, which, like devouring fire,"
1967,BOOK II.,O’erspread the land; the earth beneath them groan’d:
1968,BOOK II.,"As when the Lord of thunder, in his wrath,"
1969,BOOK II.,"The earth’s foundations shakes, in Arimi,"
1970,BOOK II.,"Where, buried deep, ’tis said, Typhoeus lies;"
1971,BOOK II.,"So at their coming, groan’d beneath their feet"
1972,BOOK II.,"The earth, as quickly o’er the plain they spread."
1973,BOOK II.,
1974,BOOK II.,"To Troy, sent down by aegis-bearing Jove,"
1975,BOOK II.,With direful tidings storm-swift Iris came.
1976,BOOK II.,"At Priam’s gate, in solemn conclave met,"
1977,BOOK II.,"Were gather’d all the Trojans, young and old:"
1978,BOOK II.,"Swift Iris stood amidst them, and, the voice"
1979,BOOK II.,"Assuming of Polites, Priam’s son,"
1980,BOOK II.,"The Trojan scout, who, trusting to his speed,"
1981,BOOK II.,Was posted on the summit of the mound
1982,BOOK II.,"Of ancient Æsuetes, there to watch"
1983,BOOK II.,Till from their ships the Grecian troops should march;
1984,BOOK II.,"His voice assuming, thus the Goddess spoke:"
1985,BOOK II.,"“Old man, as erst in peace, so still thou lov’st"
1986,BOOK II.,The strife of words; but fearful war is nigh.
1987,BOOK II.,Full many a host in line of battle rang’d
1988,BOOK II.,"My eyes have seen; but such a force as this,"
1989,BOOK II.,"So mighty and so vast, I ne’er beheld:"
1990,BOOK II.,"In number as the leaves, or as the sand,"
1991,BOOK II.,Against the city o’er the plain they come.
1992,BOOK II.,"Then, Hector, for to thee I chiefly speak,"
1993,BOOK II.,"This do; thou know’st how various our allies,"
1994,BOOK II.,Of diff’rent nations and discordant tongues:
1995,BOOK II.,"Let each then those command o’er whom he reigns,"
1996,BOOK II.,And his own countrymen in arms array.”
1997,BOOK II.,"She said; and Hector knew the voice divine,"
1998,BOOK II.,"And all, dissolv’d the council, flew to arms,"
1999,BOOK II.,"The gates were open’d wide; forth pour’d the crowd,"
2000,BOOK II.,Both foot and horse; and loud the tumult rose.
2001,BOOK II.,
2002,BOOK II.,"Before the city stands a lofty mound,"
2003,BOOK II.,"In the mid plain, by open space enclos’d;"

2128,BOOK III.,"The men of Troy advanc’d; as when the cranes,"
2129,BOOK III.,"Flying the wintry storms, send forth on high"
2130,BOOK III.,"Their dissonant clamours, while o’er the ocean stream"

2133,BOOK III.,
2134,BOOK III.,"On th’ other side the Greeks in silence mov’d,"
2135,BOOK III.,"Breathing firm courage, bent on mutual aid."
2136,BOOK III.,As when the south wind o’er the mountain tops
2137,BOOK III.,"Spreads a thick veil of mist, the shepherd’s bane,"
2138,BOOK III.,"And friendly to the nightly thief alone,"
2139,BOOK III.,That a stone’s throw the range of vision bounds;
2140,BOOK III.,"So rose the dust-cloud, as in serried ranks"
2141,BOOK III.,With rapid step they mov’d across the plain.
2142,BOOK III.,"But when th’ opposing forces near were met,"
2143,BOOK III.,"A panther’s skin across his shoulders flung,"
2144,BOOK III.,"Arm’d with his bow and sword, in front of all"
2145,BOOK III.,Advanc’d the godlike Paris; in his hand
2146,BOOK III.,"He pois’d two brass-tipp’d jav’lins, and defied"
2147,BOOK III.,To mortal combat all the chiefs of Greece.
2148,BOOK III.,
2149,BOOK III.,Him when the warlike Menelaus saw
2150,BOOK III.,With haughty strides advancing from the crowd;
2151,BOOK III.,"As when a lion, hunger-pinch’d, espies"
2152,BOOK III.,"Some mighty beast of chase, or antler’d stag,"
2153,BOOK III.,"Or mountain goat, and with exulting spring"
2154,BOOK III.,"Strikes down his prey, and on the carcase feeds,"
2155,BOOK III.,Unscar’d by baying hounds and eager youths:
2156,BOOK III.,So Menelaus saw with fierce delight
2157,BOOK III.,The godlike Paris; for he deem’d that now
2158,BOOK III.,"His vengeance was at hand; and from his car,"
2159,BOOK III.,"Arm’d as he was, he leap’d upon the plain."
2160,BOOK III.,But when the godlike Paris saw him spring
2161,BOOK III.,"Defiant from the ranks, with quailing heart,"
2162,BOOK III.,"Back to his comrades’ shelt’ring crowd he sprang,"
2163,BOOK III.,"In fear of death; as when some trav’ller spies,"
2164,BOOK III.,"Coil’d in his path upon the mountain side,"
2165,BOOK III.,"A deadly snake, back he recoils in haste,"
2166,BOOK III.,"His limbs all trembling, and his cheek all pale;"
2167,BOOK III.,"So back recoil’d, in fear of Atreus’ son,"
2168,BOOK III.,The godlike Paris ’mid the Trojan host.
2169,BOOK III.,
2170,BOOK III.,To whom in stern rebuke thus Hector spoke:
2171,BOOK III.,"“Thou wretched Paris, though in form so fair,"
2172,BOOK III.,"Thou slave of woman, manhood’s counterfeit!"
2173,BOOK III.,"Would thou hadst ne’er been born, or died at least"
2174,BOOK III.,"Unwedded; so ’twere better far for all,"
2175,BOOK III.,Than thus to live a scandal and reproach.
2176,BOOK III.,"Well may the long-hair’d Greeks triumphant boast,"
2177,BOOK III.,"Who think thee, from thine outward show, a chief"
2178,BOOK III.,Among our warriors; but thou hast in truth
2179,BOOK III.,"Nor strength of mind, nor courage in the fight."
2180,BOOK III.,How was’t that such as thou could e’er induce
2181,BOOK III.,"A noble band, in ocean-going ships"
2182,BOOK III.,"To cross the main, with men of other lands"
2183,BOOK III.,"Mixing in amity, and bearing thence"
2184,BOOK III.,"A woman, fair of face, by marriage ties"
2185,BOOK III.,"Bound to a race of warriors; to thy sire,"
2186,BOOK III.,"Thy state, thy people, cause of endless grief,"
2187,BOOK III.,"Of triumph to thy foes, contempt to thee!"
2188,BOOK III.,"Durst thou the warlike Menelaus meet,"
2189,BOOK III.,Thou to thy cost shouldst learn the might of him
2190,BOOK III.,Whose bride thou didst not fear to bear away:
2191,BOOK III.,"Then shouldst thou find of small avail thy lyre,"
2192,BOOK III.,"Or Venus’ gifts of beauty and of grace,"
2193,BOOK III.,"Or, trampled in the dust, thy flowing hair."
2194,BOOK III.,But too forbearing are the men of Troy;
2195,BOOK III.,"Else for the ills that thou hast wrought the state,"
2196,BOOK III.,Ere now thy body had in stone been cas’d.”
2197,BOOK III.,
2198,BOOK III.,To whom the godlike Paris thus replied:
2199,BOOK III.,"“Hector, I needs must own thy censure just,"
2200,BOOK III.,Nor without cause; thy dauntless courage knows
2201,BOOK III.,"Nor pause nor weariness; but as an axe,"
2202,BOOK III.,"That in a strong man’s hand, who fashions out"
2203,BOOK III.,"Some naval timber, with unbated edge"
2204,BOOK III.,"Cleaves the firm wood, and aids the striker’s force;"
2205,BOOK III.,Ev’n so unwearied is thy warlike soul.
2206,BOOK III.,Yet blame not me for golden Venus’ gifts:
2207,BOOK III.,"The gifts of Heav’n are not to be despis’d,"
2208,BOOK III.,"Which Heav’n may give, but man could not command."
2209,BOOK III.,"But if thou wilt that I should dare the fight,"
2210,BOOK III.,Bid that the Trojans and the Grecians all
2211,BOOK III.,Be seated on the ground; and in the midst
2212,BOOK III.,The warlike Menelaus and myself
2213,BOOK III.,"Stand front to front, for Helen and the spoils"
2214,BOOK III.,Of war to combat; and whoe’er shall prove
2215,BOOK III.,"The better man in conflict, let him bear"
2216,BOOK III.,The woman and the spoils in triumph home;
2217,BOOK III.,"While ye, the rest, in peace and friendship sworn,"
2218,BOOK III.,Shall still possess the fertile plains of Troy;
2219,BOOK III.,"And to their native Argos they return,"
2220,BOOK III.,For noble steeds and lovely women fam’d.”
2221,BOOK III.,
2222,BOOK III.,"He said, and Hector joy’d to hear his words:"
2223,BOOK III.,"Forth in the midst he stepp’d, and with his spear"
2224,BOOK III.,"Grasp’d by the middle, stay’d the Trojan ranks."
2225,BOOK III.,"At him the long-haired Grecians bent their bows,"
2226,BOOK III.,Prompt to assail with arrows and with stones;
2227,BOOK III.,But loud the monarch Agamemnon’s voice
2228,BOOK III.,"Was heard; “Hold, Argives, hold! ye sons of Greece,"
2229,BOOK III.,Shoot not! for Hector of the glancing helm
2230,BOOK III.,"Hath, as it seems, some message to impart.”"
2231,BOOK III.,
2232,BOOK III.,"He said; they held their hands, and silent stood"
2233,BOOK III.,"Expectant, till to both thus Hector spoke:"
2234,BOOK III.,"“Hear now, ye Trojans, and ye well-greav’d Greeks,"
2235,BOOK III.,"The words of Paris, cause of all this war."
2236,BOOK III.,He asks through me that all the host of Troy
2237,BOOK III.,And Grecian warriors shall upon the ground
2238,BOOK III.,Lay down their glitt’ring arms; while in the midst
2239,BOOK III.,The warlike Menelaus and himself
2240,BOOK III.,"Stand front to front, for Helen and the spoils"
2241,BOOK III.,Of war to combat; and whoe’er shall prove
2242,BOOK III.,"The better man in conflict, let him bear"
2243,BOOK III.,"The woman and the spoils in triumph home,"
2244,BOOK III.,"While we, the rest, firm peace and friendship swear.”"
2245,BOOK III.,
2246,BOOK III.,Thus Hector spoke; the rest in silence heard;
2247,BOOK III.,"But Menelaus, bold in fight, replied:"
2248,BOOK III.,“Hear now my answer; in this quarrel I
2249,BOOK III.,May claim the chiefest share; and now I hope
2250,BOOK III.,Trojans and Greeks may see the final close
2251,BOOK III.,Of all the labours ye so long have borne
2252,BOOK III.,"T’ avenge my wrong, at Paris’ hand sustain’d."
2253,BOOK III.,"And of us two whiche’er is doom’d to death,"
2254,BOOK III.,"So let him die! the rest, depart in peace."
2255,BOOK III.,"Bring then two lambs, one white, the other black,"
2256,BOOK III.,For Tellus and for Sol; we on our part
2257,BOOK III.,"Will bring another, for Saturnian Jove:"
2258,BOOK III.,And let the majesty of Priam too
2259,BOOK III.,"Appear, himself to consecrate our oaths,"
2260,BOOK III.,"(For reckless are his sons, and void of faith,)"
2261,BOOK III.,That none Jove’s oath may dare to violate.
2262,BOOK III.,For young men’s spirits are too quickly stirr’d;
2263,BOOK III.,"But in the councils check’d by rev’rend age,"
2264,BOOK III.,"Alike are weigh’d the future and the past,"
2265,BOOK III.,And for all int’rests due provision made.”
2266,BOOK III.,
2267,BOOK III.,"He said, and Greeks and Trojans gladly heard,"
2268,BOOK III.,In hopes of respite from the weary war.
2269,BOOK III.,They rang’d the cars in ranks; and they themselves
2270,BOOK III.,"Descending doff’d their arms, and laid them down"
2271,BOOK III.,"Close each by each, with narrow space between."
2272,BOOK III.,Two heralds to the city Hector sent
2273,BOOK III.,"To bring the lambs, and aged Priam call;"
2274,BOOK III.,"While Agamemnon to the hollow ships,"
2275,BOOK III.,"Their lamb to bring, in haste Talthybius sent:"
2276,BOOK III.,"He heard, and straight the monarch’s voice obey’d."
2277,BOOK III.,
2278,BOOK III.,"Meantime to white-arm’d Helen Iris sped,"
2279,BOOK III.,The heav’nly messenger: in form she seem’d
2280,BOOK III.,"Her husband’s sister, whom Antenor’s son,"
2281,BOOK III.,"The valiant Helicaon had to wife,"
2282,BOOK III.,"Laodice, of Priam’s daughters all"
2283,BOOK III.,Loveliest of face: she in her chamber found
2284,BOOK III.,"Her whom she sought: a mighty web she wove,"
2285,BOOK III.,Of double woof and brilliant hues; whereon
2286,BOOK III.,Was interwoven many a toilsome strife
2287,BOOK III.,"Of Trojan warriors and of brass-clad Greeks,"
2288,BOOK III.,For her encounter’d at the hand of Mars.
2289,BOOK III.,"Beside her Iris stood, and thus she spoke:"
2290,BOOK III.,"“Come, sister dear, and see the glorious deeds"
2291,BOOK III.,Of Trojan warriors and of brass-clad Greeks.
2292,BOOK III.,"They who erewhile, impatient for the fight,"
2293,BOOK III.,"Roll’d o’er the plain the woful tide of war,"
2294,BOOK III.,"Now silent sit, the storm of battle hush’d,"
2295,BOOK III.,"Reclining on their shields, their lances bright"
2296,BOOK III.,Beside them reared; while Paris in the midst
2297,BOOK III.,"And warlike Menelaus, stand prepar’d"
2298,BOOK III.,With the long spear for thee to fight; thyself
2299,BOOK III.,The prize of conquest and the victor’s wife.”
2300,BOOK III.,
2301,BOOK III.,"Thus as she spoke, in Helen’s breast arose"
2302,BOOK III.,"Fond recollection of her former Lord,"
2303,BOOK III.,"Her home, and parents; o’er her head she threw"
2304,BOOK III.,A snowy veil; and shedding tender tears
2305,BOOK III.,"She issu’d forth, not unaccompanied;"
2306,BOOK III.,"For with her went fair Æthra, Pittheus’ child,"
2307,BOOK III.,"And stag-ey’d Clymene, her maidens twain."
2308,BOOK III.,They quickly at the Scaean gate arriv’d.
2309,BOOK III.,
2310,BOOK III.,"Attending there on aged Priam, sat,"
2311,BOOK III.,"The Elders of the city; Panthous,"
2312,BOOK III.,"And Lampus, and Thymaetes; Clytius,"
2313,BOOK III.,"Bold Icetaon, and Ucalegon,"
2314,BOOK III.,"With sage Antenor, wise in council both:"
2315,BOOK III.,All these were gather’d at the Scaean gate;
2316,BOOK III.,"By age exempt from war, but in discourse"
2317,BOOK III.,"Abundant, as the cricket, that on high"
2318,BOOK III.,From topmost boughs of forest tree sends forth
2319,BOOK III.,His delicate music; so on Ilium’s tow’rs
2320,BOOK III.,Sat the sage chiefs and councillors of Troy.
2321,BOOK III.,"Helen they saw, as to the tow’r she came;"
2322,BOOK III.,"And “’tis no marvel,” one to other said,"
2323,BOOK III.,“The valiant Trojans and the well-greav’d Greeks
2324,BOOK III.,For beauty such as this should long endure
2325,BOOK III.,The toils of war; for goddess-like she seems;
2326,BOOK III.,"And yet, despite her beauty, let her go,"
2327,BOOK III.,Nor bring on us and on our sons a curse.”
2328,BOOK III.,
2329,BOOK III.,Thus they; but aged Priam Helen call’d:
2330,BOOK III.,"“Come here, my child, and sitting by my side,"
2331,BOOK III.,"From whence thou canst discern thy former Lord,"
2332,BOOK III.,"His kindred, and thy friends (not thee I blame,"
2333,BOOK III.,"But to the Gods I owe this woful war),"
2334,BOOK III.,Tell me the name of yonder mighty chief
2335,BOOK III.,Among the Greeks a warrior brave and strong:
2336,BOOK III.,Others in height surpass him; but my eyes
2337,BOOK III.,"A form so noble never yet beheld,"
2338,BOOK III.,"Nor so august; he moves, a King indeed!”"
2339,BOOK III.,
2340,BOOK III.,"To whom in answer, Helen, heav’nly fair:"
2341,BOOK III.,"“With rev’rence, dearest father, and with shame"
2342,BOOK III.,I look on thee: oh would that I had died
2343,BOOK III.,"That day when hither with thy son I came,"
2344,BOOK III.,"And left my husband, friends, and darling child,"
2345,BOOK III.,And all the lov’d companions of my youth:
2346,BOOK III.,"That I died not, with grief I pine away."
2347,BOOK III.,But to thy question; I will tell thee true;
2348,BOOK III.,"Yon chief is Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,"
2349,BOOK III.,"Wide-reigning, mighty monarch, ruler good,"
2350,BOOK III.,"And valiant warrior; in my husband’s name,"
2351,BOOK III.,"Lost as I am, I call’d him brother once.”"
2352,BOOK III.,
2353,BOOK III.,"She spoke: th’ old man admiring gaz’d, and cried,"
2354,BOOK III.,"“Oh bless’d Atrides, child of happy fate,"
2355,BOOK III.,Favour’d of Heav’n! how many noble Greeks
2356,BOOK III.,Obey thy rule! In vine-clad Phrygia once
2357,BOOK III.,I saw the hosts of Phrygian warriors wheel
2358,BOOK III.,"Their rapid steeds; and with them, all the bands"
2359,BOOK III.,"Of Otreus, and of Mygdon, godlike King,"
2360,BOOK III.,Who lay encamp’d beside Sangarius’ stream:
2361,BOOK III.,"I too with them was number’d, in the day"
2362,BOOK III.,"When met them in the field the Amazons,"
2363,BOOK III.,The woman-warriors; but their forces all
2364,BOOK III.,Reach’d not the number of the keen-ey’d Greeks.”
2365,BOOK III.,
2366,BOOK III.,"Ulysses next the old man saw, and ask’d,"
2367,BOOK III.,"“Tell me again, dear child, who this may be,"
2368,BOOK III.,"In stature less than Atreus’ royal son,"
2369,BOOK III.,"But broader-shoulder’d, and of ampler chest."
2370,BOOK III.,"His arms are laid upon the fertile plain,"
2371,BOOK III.,"But he himself is moving through the ranks,"
2372,BOOK III.,"Inspecting, like a full-fleec’d ram, that moves"
2373,BOOK III.,Majestic through a flock of snow-white ewes.”
2374,BOOK III.,
2375,BOOK III.,"To whom Jove’s offspring, Helen, thus replied:"
2376,BOOK III.,"“The wise Ulysses that, Laertes’ son:"
2377,BOOK III.,"Though bred in rugged Ithaca, yet vers’d"
2378,BOOK III.,"In ev’ry stratagem, and deep device.”"
2379,BOOK III.,"“O woman,” then the sage Antenor said,"
2380,BOOK III.,“Of these thy words I can the truth avouch;
2381,BOOK III.,"For hither when on thine account to treat,"
2382,BOOK III.,"Brave Menelaus and Ulysses came,"
2383,BOOK III.,"I lodg’d them in my house, and lov’d them both,"
2384,BOOK III.,And studied well the form and mind of each.
2385,BOOK III.,"As they with Trojans mix’d in social guise,"
2386,BOOK III.,"When both were standing, o’er his comrade high"
2387,BOOK III.,With broad-set shoulders Menelaus stood;
2388,BOOK III.,"Seated, Ulysses was the nobler form:"
2389,BOOK III.,"Then, in the great Assembly, when to all"
2390,BOOK III.,"Their public speech and argument they fram’d,"
2391,BOOK III.,"In fluent language Menelaus spoke,"
2392,BOOK III.,"In words though few, yet clear; though young in years,"
2393,BOOK III.,"No wordy babbler, wasteful of his speech:"
2394,BOOK III.,"But when the skill’d Ulysses rose to speak,"
2395,BOOK III.,"With down-cast visage would he stand, his eyes"
2396,BOOK III.,"Bent on the ground; the staff he bore, nor back"
2397,BOOK III.,"He wav’d, nor forward, but like one untaught,"
2398,BOOK III.,He held it motionless; who only saw
2399,BOOK III.,"Would say that he was mad, or void of sense;"
2400,BOOK III.,"But when his chest its deep-ton’d voice sent forth,"
2401,BOOK III.,"With words that fell like flakes of wintry snow,"
2402,BOOK III.,No mortal with Ulysses could compare:
2403,BOOK III.,Then little reck’d we of his outward show.”
2404,BOOK III.,
2405,BOOK III.,At sight of Ajax next th’ old man enquir’d;
2406,BOOK III.,"“Who is yon other warrior, brave and strong,"
2407,BOOK III.,Tow’ring o’er all with head and shoulders broad?”
2408,BOOK III.,
2409,BOOK III.,"To whom, in answer, Helen, heav’nly fair:"
2410,BOOK III.,"“Gigantic Ajax that, the prop of Greece;"
2411,BOOK III.,And by his side Idomeneus of Crete
2412,BOOK III.,"Stands godlike, circled round by Cretan chiefs."
2413,BOOK III.,The warlike Menelaus welcom’d him
2414,BOOK III.,"Oft in our palace, when from Crete he came."
2415,BOOK III.,"Now all the other keen-ey’d Greeks I see,"
2416,BOOK III.,"Whom once I knew, and now could call by name;"
2417,BOOK III.,"But two I miss, two captains of the host,"
2418,BOOK III.,"My own two brethren, and my mother’s sons,"
2419,BOOK III.,"Castor and Pollux; Castor, charioteer"
2420,BOOK III.,"Unrivalled, Pollux, matchless pugilist."
2421,BOOK III.,In Lacedaemon have they stay’d behind?
2422,BOOK III.,"Or can it be, in ocean-going ships"
2423,BOOK III.,"That they have come indeed, but shun to join"
2424,BOOK III.,"The fight of warriors, fearful of the shame,"
2425,BOOK III.,And deep disgrace that on my name attend?”
2426,BOOK III.,Thus she; but they beneath the teeming earth
2427,BOOK III.,"In Lacedaemon lay, their native land."
2428,BOOK III.,
2429,BOOK III.,Meanwhile the heralds through the city bore
2430,BOOK III.,"The treaty off’rings to the Gods; the lambs,"
2431,BOOK III.,"And genial wine, the produce of the soil,"
2432,BOOK III.,"In goat-skin flasks: therewith a flagon bright,"
2433,BOOK III.,"And cups of gold, Idaeus brought, and stood"
2434,BOOK III.,"Beside the aged King, as thus he spoke:"
2435,BOOK III.,"“Son of Laomedon, arise! the chiefs"
2436,BOOK III.,Of Trojan warriors and of brass-clad Greeks
2437,BOOK III.,Call for thy presence on the battle-plain
2438,BOOK III.,To swear a truce; where Paris in the midst
2439,BOOK III.,And warlike Menelaus stand prepar’d
2440,BOOK III.,With the long spear for Helen and the spoils
2441,BOOK III.,"Of war to combat, that whoe’er may prove"
2442,BOOK III.,"The better man in fight, may bear away"
2443,BOOK III.,The woman and the spoils in triumph home;
2444,BOOK III.,"While we, the rest, in peace and friendship sworn,"
2445,BOOK III.,Shall still possess the fertile plains of Troy;
2446,BOOK III.,And to their native Argos they return.
2447,BOOK III.,For noble steeds and lovely women fam’d.”
2448,BOOK III.,
2449,BOOK III.,He said; the old man shuddered at his words:
2450,BOOK III.,But to his comrades gave command forthwith.
2451,BOOK III.,To yoke his car; and they his word obey’d.
2452,BOOK III.,"Priam, ascending, gather’d up the reins,"
2453,BOOK III.,"And with Antenor by his side, the twain"
2454,BOOK III.,Drove through the Scaean gate their flying steeds.
2455,BOOK III.,
2456,BOOK III.,"But when between th’ opposing ranks they came,"
2457,BOOK III.,"Alighting from the car, they mov’d on foot"
2458,BOOK III.,Between the Trojan and the Grecian hosts.
2459,BOOK III.,"Uprose then Agamemnon, King of men,"
2460,BOOK III.,Uprose the sage Ulysses; to the front
2461,BOOK III.,"The heralds brought the off’rings to the Gods,"
2462,BOOK III.,"And in the flagon mix’d the wine, and pour’d"
2463,BOOK III.,The hallowing water on the monarchs’ hands.
2464,BOOK III.,"His dagger then the son of Atreus drew,"
2465,BOOK III.,"Suspended, as was wont, beside the hilt"
2466,BOOK III.,Of his great sword; and from the victim’s head
2467,BOOK III.,"He cut the sacred lock, which to the chiefs"
2468,BOOK III.,Of Troy and Greece the heralds portion’d out.
2469,BOOK III.,Then with uplifted hands he pray’d aloud:
2470,BOOK III.,"“O Father Jove! who rul’st from Ida’s height,"
2471,BOOK III.,"Most great! most glorious! and thou Sun, who see’st"
2472,BOOK III.,And hearest all things! Rivers! and thou Earth!
2473,BOOK III.,"And ye, who after death beneath the earth"
2474,BOOK III.,"Your vengeance wreak on souls of men forsworn,"
2475,BOOK III.,"Be witness ye, and this our cov’nant guard."
2476,BOOK III.,"If Menelaus fall by Paris’ hand,"
2477,BOOK III.,"Let him retain both Helen and the spoil,"
2478,BOOK III.,While in our ships we take our homeward way;
2479,BOOK III.,"If Paris be by Menelaus slain,"
2480,BOOK III.,"Troy shall surrender Helen and the spoil,"
2481,BOOK III.,"With compensation due to Greece, that so"
2482,BOOK III.,A record may to future days remain.
2483,BOOK III.,"But, Paris slain, if Priam and his sons"
2484,BOOK III.,"The promis’d compensation shall withhold,"
2485,BOOK III.,"Then here, my rights in battle to assert,"
2486,BOOK III.,"Will I remain, till I the end achieve.”"
2487,BOOK III.,
2488,BOOK III.,"Thus as he spoke, across the victims’ throats"
2489,BOOK III.,"He drew the pitiless blade, and on the ground"
2490,BOOK III.,"He laid them gasping, as the stream of life"
2491,BOOK III.,"Pour’d forth, their vigour by the blade subdued."
2492,BOOK III.,"Then, from the flagon drawn, from out the cups"
2493,BOOK III.,The wine they pour’d; and to th’ eternal Gods
2494,BOOK III.,They pray’d; and thus from Trojans and from Greeks
2495,BOOK III.,"Arose the joint petition; “Grant, O Jove!"
2496,BOOK III.,"Most great! most glorious! grant, ye heav’nly pow’rs,"
2497,BOOK III.,"That whosoe’er this solemn truce shall break,"
2498,BOOK III.,"Ev’n as this wine we pour, their hearts’ best blood,"
2499,BOOK III.,"Theirs and their children’s, on the earth be pour’d,"
2500,BOOK III.,And strangers in subjection take their wives!”
2501,BOOK III.,
2502,BOOK III.,"Thus they; but Jove, unyielding, heard their pray’r."
2503,BOOK III.,"The rites perform’d, then aged Priam spoke:"
2504,BOOK III.,"“Hear me, ye Trojans, and ye well-greav’d Greeks!"
2505,BOOK III.,"To Ilium’s breezy heights I now withdraw,"
2506,BOOK III.,For that mine eyes will not endure the sight
2507,BOOK III.,Of warlike Menelaus and my son
2508,BOOK III.,Engag’d in deadly combat; of the two
2509,BOOK III.,"Which may be doom’d to death, is only known"
2510,BOOK III.,"To Jove, and to th’ immortal pow’rs of Heav’n.”"
2511,BOOK III.,
2512,BOOK III.,Thus spoke the godlike King; and on the car
2513,BOOK III.,He plac’d the consecrated lambs; himself
2514,BOOK III.,"Ascending then, he gather’d up the reins,"
2515,BOOK III.,"And with Antenor by his side, the twain"
2516,BOOK III.,To Ilium’s walls retrac’d their homeward way.
2517,BOOK III.,
2518,BOOK III.,"Then Hector, son of Priam, measur’d out,"
2519,BOOK III.,"With sage Ulysses join’d, th’ allotted space;"
2520,BOOK III.,"Next, in the brass-bound helmet cast the lots,"
2521,BOOK III.,Which of the two the first should throw the spear.
2522,BOOK III.,"The crowd, with hands uplifted, to the Gods,"
2523,BOOK III.,"Trojans and Greeks alike, address’d their pray’r:"
2524,BOOK III.,"“O Father Jove! who rul’st from Ida’s height,"
2525,BOOK III.,Most great! most glorious! grant that whosoe’er
2526,BOOK III.,On both our armies hath this turmoil brought
2527,BOOK III.,"May undergo the doom of death, and we,"
2528,BOOK III.,"The rest, firm peace and lasting friendship swear.”"
2529,BOOK III.,
2530,BOOK III.,"Thus they; great Hector of the glancing helm,"
2531,BOOK III.,"With eyes averted, shook the casque; and forth"
2532,BOOK III.,Was cast the lot of Paris; on the ground
2533,BOOK III.,"The rest lay down by ranks, where near to each"
2534,BOOK III.,"Were rang’d his active steeds, and glitt’ring arms."
2535,BOOK III.,"Then o’er his shoulders fair-hair’d Helen’s Lord,"
2536,BOOK III.,"The godlike Paris, donn’d his armour bright:"
2537,BOOK III.,"First on his legs the well-wrought greaves he fix’d,"
2538,BOOK III.,Fasten’d with silver clasps; his ample chest
2539,BOOK III.,"A breastplate guarded, by Lycaon lent,"
2540,BOOK III.,"His brother, but which fitted well his form."
2541,BOOK III.,"Around his shoulders slung, his sword he bore,"
2542,BOOK III.,"Brass-bladed, silver-studded; then his shield"
2543,BOOK III.,Weighty and strong; and on his firm-set head
2544,BOOK III.,"A helm he wore, well wrought, with horsehair plume"
2545,BOOK III.,"That nodded, fearful, o’er his brow; his hand"
2546,BOOK III.,"Grasp’d the firm spear, familiar to his hold."
2547,BOOK III.,Prepar’d alike the adverse warrior stood.
2548,BOOK III.,
2549,BOOK III.,"They, from the crowd apart their armour donn’d,"
2550,BOOK III.,"Came forth: and each, with eyes of mutual hate,"
2551,BOOK III.,Regarded each: admiring wonder seiz’d
2552,BOOK III.,"The Trojan warriors and the well-greav’d Greeks,"
2553,BOOK III.,As in the centre of the measur’d ground
2554,BOOK III.,"They stood oppos’d, and pois’d their quiv’ring spears."
2555,BOOK III.,"First Paris threw his weighty spear, and struck"
2556,BOOK III.,"Fair in the midst Atrides’ buckler round,"
2557,BOOK III.,But broke not through; upon the stubborn targe
2558,BOOK III.,"Was bent the lance’s point; then thus to Jove,"
2559,BOOK III.,"His weapon hurling, Menelaus pray’d:"
2560,BOOK III.,"“Great King, on him who wrought me causeless wrong,"
2561,BOOK III.,"On Paris, grant that retribution due"
2562,BOOK III.,My arm may bring; that men in days to come
2563,BOOK III.,"May fear their host to injure, and repay"
2564,BOOK III.,With treach’rous wile his hospitable cares.”
2565,BOOK III.,
2566,BOOK III.,"He said, and poising, hurl’d his weighty spear:"
2567,BOOK III.,Full in the midst it struck the buckler round;
2568,BOOK III.,"Right through the buckler pass’d the sturdy spear,"
2569,BOOK III.,"And through the gorgeous breastplate, and within"
2570,BOOK III.,"Cut through the linen vest; but Paris, back"
2571,BOOK III.,"Inclining, stoop’d, and shunn’d the doom of death."
2572,BOOK III.,
2573,BOOK III.,Atrides then his silver-studded sword
2574,BOOK III.,"Rearing on high, a mighty blow let fall"
2575,BOOK III.,On Paris’ helm; but shiv’ring in his hand
2576,BOOK III.,In countless fragments new the faithless blade.
2577,BOOK III.,"Then thus to Jove, with eyes uplift to Heav’n,"
2578,BOOK III.,Atrides made his moan: “O Father Jove!
2579,BOOK III.,"Of all the Gods, the most unfriendly thou!"
2580,BOOK III.,On Paris’ head I hop’d for all his crimes
2581,BOOK III.,To wreak my vengeance due; but in my grasp
2582,BOOK III.,"My faithless sword is shatter’d, and my spear"
2583,BOOK III.,"Hath bootless left my hand, nor reached my foe.”"
2584,BOOK III.,"Then onward rushing, by the horsehair plume"
2585,BOOK III.,"He seiz’d his foeman’s helm, and wrenching round"
2586,BOOK III.,Dragg’d by main force amid the well-greav’d Greeks.
2587,BOOK III.,"The broider’d strap, that, pass’d beneath his beard,"
2588,BOOK III.,"The helmet held, the warrior’s throat compress’d:"
2589,BOOK III.,"Then had Atrides dragg’d him from the field,"
2590,BOOK III.,"And endless fame acquir’d; but Venus, child"
2591,BOOK III.,"Of Jove, her fav’rite’s peril quickly saw."
2592,BOOK III.,And broke the throttling strap of tough bull’s hide.
2593,BOOK III.,In the broad hand the empty helm remained.
2594,BOOK III.,"The trophy, by their champion whirl’d amid"
2595,BOOK III.,"The well-greav’d Greeks, his eager comrades seiz’d;"
2596,BOOK III.,"While he, infuriate, rush’d with murd’rous aim"
2597,BOOK III.,"On Priam’s son; but him, the Queen of Love"
2598,BOOK III.,"(As Gods can only) from the field convey’d,"
2599,BOOK III.,"Wrapt in a misty cloud; and on a couch,"
2600,BOOK III.,"Sweet perfumes breathing, gently laid him down;"
2601,BOOK III.,"Then went in search of Helen; her she found,"
2602,BOOK III.,"Circled with Trojan dames, on Ilium’s tow’r:"
2603,BOOK III.,"Her by her airy robe the Goddess held,"
2604,BOOK III.,And in the likeness of an aged dame
2605,BOOK III.,"Who oft for her, in Sparta when she dwelt,"
2606,BOOK III.,"Many a fair fleece had wrought, and lov’d her well,"
2607,BOOK III.,"Address’d her thus: “Come, Helen, to thy house;"
2608,BOOK III.,"Come, Paris calls thee; in his chamber he"
2609,BOOK III.,"Expects thee, resting on luxurious couch,"
2610,BOOK III.,"In costly garb, with manly beauty grac’d:"
2611,BOOK III.,Not from the fight of warriors wouldst thou deem
2612,BOOK III.,"He late had come, but for the dance prepar’d,"
2613,BOOK III.,Or resting from the dance’s pleasing toil.”
2614,BOOK III.,
2615,BOOK III.,"She said, and Helen’s spirit within her mov’d;"
2616,BOOK III.,"And when she saw the Goddess’ beauteous neck,"
2617,BOOK III.,"Her lovely bosom, and her glowing eyes,"
2618,BOOK III.,"She gaz’d in wonder, and address’d her thus:"
2619,BOOK III.,"“Oh why, great Goddess, make me thus thy sport?"
2620,BOOK III.,Seek’st thou to bear me far away from hence
2621,BOOK III.,"To some fair Phrygian or Maeonian town,"
2622,BOOK III.,If there some mortal have thy favour gain’d?
2623,BOOK III.,"Or, for that Menelaus in the field"
2624,BOOK III.,"Hath vanquish’d Paris, and is willing yet"
2625,BOOK III.,"That I, his bane, should to his home return;"
2626,BOOK III.,"Here art thou found, to weave again thy wiles!"
2627,BOOK III.,Go then thyself! thy godship abdicate!
2628,BOOK III.,Renounce Olympus! lavish here on him
2629,BOOK III.,Thy pity and thy care! he may perchance
2630,BOOK III.,Make thee his wife—at least his paramour!
2631,BOOK III.,But thither go not I! foul shame it were
2632,BOOK III.,Again to share his bed; the dames of Troy
2633,BOOK III.,Will for a byword hold me; and e’en now
2634,BOOK III.,My soul with endless sorrow is possess’d.”
2635,BOOK III.,
2636,BOOK III.,To whom in anger heav’nly Venus spoke:
2637,BOOK III.,"“Incense me not, poor fool! lest I in wrath"
2638,BOOK III.,"Desert thee quite, and as I heretofore"
2639,BOOK III.,"Have lov’d, so make thee object of my hate;"
2640,BOOK III.,"And kindle, ’twixt the Trojans and the Greeks,"
2641,BOOK III.,"Such bitter feuds, as both shall wreak on thee.”"
2642,BOOK III.,
2643,BOOK III.,"She said; and trembled Helen, child of Jove;"
2644,BOOK III.,She rose in silence; in a snow-white veil
2645,BOOK III.,"All glitt’ring, shrouded; by the Goddess led"
2646,BOOK III.,"She pass’d, unnotic’d by the Trojan dames."
2647,BOOK III.,"But when to Paris’ splendid house they came,"
2648,BOOK III.,"Thronging around her, her attendants gave"
2649,BOOK III.,Their duteous service; through the lofty hall
2650,BOOK III.,With queenly grace the godlike woman pass’d.
2651,BOOK III.,A seat the laughter-loving Goddess plac’d
2652,BOOK III.,"By Paris’ side; there Helen sat, the child"
2653,BOOK III.,"Of aegis-bearing Jove, with downcast eyes,"
2654,BOOK III.,Yet with sharp words she thus address’d her Lord:
2655,BOOK III.,“Back from the battle? would thou there hadst died
2656,BOOK III.,"Beneath a warrior’s arm, whom once I call’d"
2657,BOOK III.,My husband! vainly didst thou boast erewhile
2658,BOOK III.,"Thine arm, thy dauntless courage, and thy spear"
2659,BOOK III.,The warlike Menelaus should subdue!
2660,BOOK III.,"Go now again, and challenge to the fight"
2661,BOOK III.,The warlike Menelaus. Be thou ware!
2662,BOOK III.,"I warn thee, pause, ere madly thou presume"
2663,BOOK III.,With fair-hair’d Menelaus to contend!
2664,BOOK III.,Soon shouldst thou fall beneath his conqu’ring spear.”
2665,BOOK III.,
2666,BOOK III.,To whom thus Paris: “Wring not thus my soul
2667,BOOK III.,"With keen reproaches: now, with Pallas’ aid,"
2668,BOOK III.,Hath Menelaus conquer’d; but my day
2669,BOOK III.,Will come: I too can boast my guardian Gods.
2670,BOOK III.,"But turn we now to love, and love’s delights;"
2671,BOOK III.,For never did thy beauty so inflame
2672,BOOK III.,My sense; not when from Lacedaemon first

2676,BOOK III.,
2677,BOOK III.,"He said, and led her to the nuptial couch;"
2678,BOOK III.,Her Lord she follow’d; and while there reclin’d
2679,BOOK III.,"Upon the richly-inlaid couch they lay,"
2680,BOOK III.,"Atrides, like a lion baffled, rush’d"
2681,BOOK III.,"Amid the crowd, if haply he might find"
2682,BOOK III.,The godlike Paris; but not one of all
2683,BOOK III.,The Trojans and their brave allies could aid
2684,BOOK III.,The warlike Menelaus in his search;
2685,BOOK III.,"Not that, for love, would any one that knew"
2686,BOOK III.,"Have screen’d him from his anger, for they all"
2687,BOOK III.,Abhorr’d him as the shade of death: then thus
2688,BOOK III.,"Outspoke great Agamemnon, King of men:"
2689,BOOK III.,"“Hear me, ye Trojans, Dardans, and Allies!"
2690,BOOK III.,"With warlike Menelaus rests, ’tis plain,"
2691,BOOK III.,The prize of vict’ry: then surrender ye
2692,BOOK III.,"The Argive Helen and the spoils of war,"
2693,BOOK III.,"With compensation due to Greece, that so"
2694,BOOK III.,A record may to future days remain.”
2695,BOOK III.,
2696,BOOK III.,"Thus he; the Greeks, assenting, cheer’d his words."

2721,BOOK IV.,"On golden pavement, round the board of Jove,"
2722,BOOK IV.,The Gods were gather’d; Hebe in the midst
2723,BOOK IV.,"Pour’d the sweet nectar; they, in golden cups,"
2724,BOOK IV.,"Each other pledg’d, as down they look’d on Troy."
2725,BOOK IV.,"Then Jove, with cutting words and taunting tone,"
2726,BOOK IV.,Began the wrath of Juno to provoke:
2727,BOOK IV.,"“Two Goddesses for Menelaus fight,"
2728,BOOK IV.,"Thou, Juno, Queen of Argos, and with thee"
2729,BOOK IV.,"Minerva, shield of warriors; but ye two"
2730,BOOK IV.,"Sitting aloof, well-pleased it seems, look on;"
2731,BOOK IV.,"While laughter-loving Venus, at the side"
2732,BOOK IV.,"Of Paris standing, still averts his fate,"
2733,BOOK IV.,"And rescues, when, as now, expecting death."
2734,BOOK IV.,"To warlike Menelaus we decree,"
2735,BOOK IV.,"Of right, the vict’ry; but consult we now"
2736,BOOK IV.,What may the issue be; if we shall light
2737,BOOK IV.,"Again the name of war and discord fierce,"

2741,BOOK IV.,To warlike Menelaus be restor’d.”
2742,BOOK IV.,
2743,BOOK IV.,"So spoke the God; but seated side by side,"
2744,BOOK IV.,Juno and Pallas glances interchang’d
2745,BOOK IV.,Of ill portent for Troy; Pallas indeed
2746,BOOK IV.,"Sat silent; and, though inly wroth with Jove,"
2747,BOOK IV.,Yet answer’d not a word; but Juno’s breast
2748,BOOK IV.,"Could not contain her rage, and thus she spoke:"
2749,BOOK IV.,"“What words, dread son of Saturn, dost thou speak?"
2750,BOOK IV.,"How wouldst thou render vain, and void of fruit,"
2751,BOOK IV.,"My weary labour and my horses’ toil,"
2752,BOOK IV.,"To stir the people, and on Priam’s self,"
2753,BOOK IV.,"And Priam’s offspring, bring disastrous fate?"
2754,BOOK IV.,Do as thou wilt! yet not with our consent.”
2755,BOOK IV.,
2756,BOOK IV.,"To whom, in wrath, the Cloud-compeller thus:"
2757,BOOK IV.,“Revengeful! how have Priam and his sons
2758,BOOK IV.,"So deeply injur’d thee, that thus thou seek’st"
2759,BOOK IV.,"With unabated anger to pursue,"
2760,BOOK IV.,"Till thou o’erthrow, the strong-built walls of Troy?"
2761,BOOK IV.,"Couldst thou but force the gates, and entering in"
2762,BOOK IV.,"On Priam’s mangled flesh, and Priam’s sons,"
2763,BOOK IV.,"And Trojans all, a bloody banquet make."
2764,BOOK IV.,Perchance thy fury might at length be stayed.
2765,BOOK IV.,"But have thy will, lest this in future times"
2766,BOOK IV.,’Twixt me and thee be cause of strife renew’d.
2767,BOOK IV.,"Yet hear my words, and ponder what I say:"
2768,BOOK IV.,"If e’er, in times to come, my will should be"
2769,BOOK IV.,"Some city to destroy, inhabited"
2770,BOOK IV.,"By men beloved of thee, seek not to turn"

2772,BOOK IV.,"Consenting, but with heart that ill consents;"
2773,BOOK IV.,"For of all cities fair, beneath the sun"
2774,BOOK IV.,"And starry Heaven, the abode of mortal men,"
2775,BOOK IV.,"None to my soul was dear as sacred Troy,"
2776,BOOK IV.,"And Priam’s self, and Priam’s warrior race."
2777,BOOK IV.,"For with drink-off’rings due, and fat of lambs,"
2778,BOOK IV.,My altar still hath at their hands been fed;
2779,BOOK IV.,Such honour hath to us been ever paid.”
2780,BOOK IV.,
2781,BOOK IV.,To whom the stag-ey’d Juno thus replied:
2782,BOOK IV.,"“Three cities are there, dearest to my heart;"
2783,BOOK IV.,"Argos, and Sparta, and the ample streets"
2784,BOOK IV.,Of rich Mycenæ; work on them thy will;
2785,BOOK IV.,"Destroy them, if thine anger they incur;"
2786,BOOK IV.,"I will not interpose, nor hinder thee;"
2787,BOOK IV.,"Mourn them I shall; reluctant see their fall,"
2788,BOOK IV.,But not resist; for sovereign is thy will.
2789,BOOK IV.,Yet should my labours not be fruitless all;
2790,BOOK IV.,For I too am a God; my blood is thine;
2791,BOOK IV.,"Worthy of honour, as the eldest born"
2792,BOOK IV.,"Of deep-designing Saturn, and thy wife;"
2793,BOOK IV.,"Thine, who o’er all th’ Immortals reign’st supreme."
2794,BOOK IV.,"But yield we each to other, I to thee,"
2795,BOOK IV.,And thou to me; the other Gods will all
2796,BOOK IV.,By us be rul’d. On Pallas then enjoin
2797,BOOK IV.,That to the battle-field of Greece and Troy
2798,BOOK IV.,"She haste, and so contrive that Trojans first"
2799,BOOK IV.,"May break the treaty, and the Greeks assail.”"
2800,BOOK IV.,
2801,BOOK IV.,"She said: the Sire of Gods and men complied,"
2802,BOOK IV.,And thus with winged words to Pallas spoke:
2803,BOOK IV.,“Go to the battle-field of Greece and Troy
2804,BOOK IV.,"In haste, and so contrive that Trojans first"
2805,BOOK IV.,"May break the treaty, and the Greeks assail.”"
2806,BOOK IV.,
2807,BOOK IV.,"His words fresh impulse gave to Pallas’ zeal,"
2808,BOOK IV.,And from Olympus’ heights in haste she sped;
2809,BOOK IV.,"Like to a meteor, that, of grave portent"
2810,BOOK IV.,"To warring armies or sea-faring men,"
2811,BOOK IV.,"The son of deep-designing Saturn sends,"
2812,BOOK IV.,"Bright-flashing, scatt’ring fiery sparks around,"
2813,BOOK IV.,"The blue-ey’d Goddess darted down to earth,"
2814,BOOK IV.,And lighted in the midst; amazement held
2815,BOOK IV.,The Trojan warriors and the well-greav’d Greeks;
2816,BOOK IV.,"And one to other look’d and said, “What means"
2817,BOOK IV.,"This sign? Must fearful battle rage again,"
2818,BOOK IV.,"Or may we hope for gentle peace from Jove,"
2819,BOOK IV.,Who to mankind dispenses peace and war?”
2820,BOOK IV.,Such was the converse Greeks and Trojans held.
2821,BOOK IV.,"Pallas meanwhile, amid the Trojan host,"
2822,BOOK IV.,"Clad in the likeness of Antenor’s son,"
2823,BOOK IV.,"Laodocus, a spearman stout and brave,"
2824,BOOK IV.,"Search’d here and there, if haply she might find"
2825,BOOK IV.,The godlike Pandarus; Lycaon’s son
2826,BOOK IV.,"She found, of noble birth and stalwart form,"
2827,BOOK IV.,"Standing, encircled by his sturdy band"
2828,BOOK IV.,"Of bucklered followers from Æsepus’ stream,"
2829,BOOK IV.,"She stood beside him, and address’d him thus:"
2830,BOOK IV.,
2831,BOOK IV.,"“Wilt thou by me be ruled, Lycaon’s son?"
2832,BOOK IV.,For durst thou but at Menelaus shoot
2833,BOOK IV.,"Thy winged arrow, great would be thy fame,"
2834,BOOK IV.,"And great thy favour with the men of Troy,"
2835,BOOK IV.,And most of all with Paris; at his hand
2836,BOOK IV.,"Thou shalt receive rich guerdon, when he hears"
2837,BOOK IV.,"That warlike Menelaus, by thy shaft"
2838,BOOK IV.,"Subdued, is laid upon the fun’ral pyre."
2839,BOOK IV.,"Bend then thy bow at Atreus’ glorious son,"
2840,BOOK IV.,"Vowing to Phoebus, Lycia’s guardian God,"
2841,BOOK IV.,"The Archer-King, to pay of firstling lambs"
2842,BOOK IV.,"An ample hecatomb, when home return’d"
2843,BOOK IV.,In safety to Zeleia’s sacred town.”
2844,BOOK IV.,"Thus she; and, fool, he listen’d to her words."
2845,BOOK IV.,"Straight he uncas’d his polish’d bow, his spoil"
2846,BOOK IV.,"Won from a mountain ibex, which himself,"
2847,BOOK IV.,"In ambush lurking, through the breast had shot,"
2848,BOOK IV.,"True to his aim, as from behind a crag"
2849,BOOK IV.,He came in sight; prone on the rock he fell;
2850,BOOK IV.,With horns of sixteen palms his head was crown’d;
2851,BOOK IV.,"These deftly wrought a skilful workman’s hand,"
2852,BOOK IV.,"And polish’d smooth, and tipp’d the ends with gold."
2853,BOOK IV.,"He bent, and resting on the ground his bow,"
2854,BOOK IV.,Strung it anew; his faithful comrades held
2855,BOOK IV.,"Their shields before him, lest the sons of Greece"
2856,BOOK IV.,Should make their onset ere his shaft could reach
2857,BOOK IV.,"The warlike Menelaus, Atreus’ son."
2858,BOOK IV.,"His quiver then withdrawing from its case,"
2859,BOOK IV.,"With care a shaft he chose, ne’er shot before,"
2860,BOOK IV.,"Well-feather’d, messenger of pangs and death;"
2861,BOOK IV.,"The stinging arrow fitted to the string,"
2862,BOOK IV.,"And vow’d to Phoebus, Lycia’s guardian God,"
2863,BOOK IV.,"The Archer-King, to pay of firstling lambs"
2864,BOOK IV.,"An ample hecatomb, when home return’d"
2865,BOOK IV.,In safety to Zeleia’s sacred town.
2866,BOOK IV.,At once the sinew and the notch he drew;
2867,BOOK IV.,"The sinew to his breast, and to the bow"
2868,BOOK IV.,"The iron head; then, when the mighty bow"
2869,BOOK IV.,"Was to a circle strain’d, sharp rang the horn,"
2870,BOOK IV.,"And loud the sinew twang’d, as tow’rd the crowd"
2871,BOOK IV.,With deadly speed the eager arrow sprang.
2872,BOOK IV.,
2873,BOOK IV.,"Nor, Menelaus, was thy safety then"
2874,BOOK IV.,"Uncar’d for of the Gods; Jove’s daughter first,"
2875,BOOK IV.,"Pallas, before thee stood, and turn’d aside"
2876,BOOK IV.,The pointed arrow; turn’d it so aside
2877,BOOK IV.,"As when a mother from her infant’s cheek,"
2878,BOOK IV.,"Wrapt in sweet slumbers, brushes off a fly;"
2879,BOOK IV.,Its course she so directed that it struck
2880,BOOK IV.,"Just where the golden clasps the belt restrain’d,"
2881,BOOK IV.,"And where the breastplate, doubled, check’d its force."
2882,BOOK IV.,On the close-fitting belt the arrow struck;
2883,BOOK IV.,Right through the belt of curious workmanship
2884,BOOK IV.,"It drove, and through the breastplate richly wrought,"
2885,BOOK IV.,"And through the coat of mail he wore beneath,"
2886,BOOK IV.,His inmost guard and best defence to check
2887,BOOK IV.,The hostile weapons’ force; yet onward still
2888,BOOK IV.,"The arrow drove, and graz’d the hero’s flesh."
2889,BOOK IV.,Forth issued from the wound the crimson blood.
2890,BOOK IV.,"As when some Carian or Maeonian maid,"
2891,BOOK IV.,"With crimson dye the ivory stains, designed"
2892,BOOK IV.,"To be the cheek-piece of a warrior’s steed,"
2893,BOOK IV.,"By many a valiant horseman coveted,"
2894,BOOK IV.,"As in the house it lies, a monarch’s boast,"
2895,BOOK IV.,"The horse adorning, and the horseman’s pride:"
2896,BOOK IV.,"So, Menelaus, then thy graceful thighs,"
2897,BOOK IV.,"And knees, and ancles, with thy blood were dy’d."
2898,BOOK IV.,
2899,BOOK IV.,Great Agamemnon shudder’d as he saw
2900,BOOK IV.,The crimson drops out-welling from the wound;
2901,BOOK IV.,Shudder’d the warlike Menelaus’ self;
2902,BOOK IV.,But when not buried in his flesh he saw
2903,BOOK IV.,"The barb and sinew, back his spirit came."
2904,BOOK IV.,
2905,BOOK IV.,"Then deeply groaning, Agamemnon spoke,"
2906,BOOK IV.,"As Menelaus by the hand he held,"
2907,BOOK IV.,"And with him groan’d his comrades: “Brother dear,"
2908,BOOK IV.,"I wrought thy death when late, on compact sworn,"
2909,BOOK IV.,I sent thee forth alone for Greece to fight;
2910,BOOK IV.,"Wounded by Trojans, who their plighted faith"
2911,BOOK IV.,Have trodden under foot; but not in vain
2912,BOOK IV.,"Are solemn cov’nants and the blood of lambs,"
2913,BOOK IV.,"The treaty wine outpoured, and hand-plight given,"
2914,BOOK IV.,"Wherein men place their trust; if not at once,"
2915,BOOK IV.,Yet soon or late will Jove assert their claim;
2916,BOOK IV.,And heavy penalties the perjured pay
2917,BOOK IV.,"With their own blood, their children’s, and their wives’."
2918,BOOK IV.,So in my inmost soul full well I know
2919,BOOK IV.,"The day shall come when this imperial Troy,"
2920,BOOK IV.,"And Priam’s race, and Priam’s royal self,"
2921,BOOK IV.,Shall in one common ruin be o’erthrown;
2922,BOOK IV.,"And Saturn’s son himself, high-throned Jove,"
2923,BOOK IV.,"Who dwells in Heav’n, shall in their faces flash"
2924,BOOK IV.,"His aegis dark and dread, this treach’rous deed"
2925,BOOK IV.,Avenging; this shall surely come to pass.
2926,BOOK IV.,"But, Menelaus, deep will be my grief,"
2927,BOOK IV.,"If thou shouldst perish, meeting thus thy fate."
2928,BOOK IV.,To thirsty Argos should I then return
2929,BOOK IV.,"By foul disgrace o’erwhelm’d; for, with thy fall,"
2930,BOOK IV.,The Greeks will mind them of their native land;
2931,BOOK IV.,And as a trophy to the sons of Troy
2932,BOOK IV.,The Argive Helen leave; thy bones meanwhile
2933,BOOK IV.,Shall moulder here beneath a foreign soil.
2934,BOOK IV.,Thy work undone; and with insulting scorn
2935,BOOK IV.,"Some vaunting Trojan, leaping on the tomb"
2936,BOOK IV.,"Of noble Menelaus, thus shall say:"
2937,BOOK IV.,‘On all his foes may Agamemnon so
2938,BOOK IV.,"His wrath accomplish, who hath hither led"
2939,BOOK IV.,"Of Greeks a mighty army, all in vain;"
2940,BOOK IV.,"And bootless home with empty ships hath gone,"
2941,BOOK IV.,And valiant Menelaus left behind;’
2942,BOOK IV.,"Thus when men speak, gape, earth, and hide my shame.”"
2943,BOOK IV.,
2944,BOOK IV.,To whom the fair-hair’d Menelaus thus
2945,BOOK IV.,"With, cheering words: “Fear not thyself, nor cause"
2946,BOOK IV.,The troops to fear: the arrow hath not touch’d
2947,BOOK IV.,A vital part: the sparkling belt hath first
2948,BOOK IV.,"Turn’d it aside, the doublet next beneath,"
2949,BOOK IV.,"And coat of mail, the work of arm’rer’s hands.”"
2950,BOOK IV.,
2951,BOOK IV.,To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus:
2952,BOOK IV.,"“Dear Menelaus, may thy words be true!"
2953,BOOK IV.,"The leech shall tend thy wound, and spread it o’er"
2954,BOOK IV.,With healing ointments to assuage the pain.”
2955,BOOK IV.,
2956,BOOK IV.,"He said, and to the sacred herald call’d:"
2957,BOOK IV.,"“Haste thee, Talthybius! summon with all speed"
2958,BOOK IV.,"The son of Æsculapius, peerless leech,"
2959,BOOK IV.,Machaon; bid him hither haste to see
2960,BOOK IV.,"The warlike Menelaus, chief of Greeks,"
2961,BOOK IV.,"Who by an arrow from some practis’d hand,"
2962,BOOK IV.,"Trojan or Lycian, hath receiv’d a wound;"
2963,BOOK IV.,"A cause of boast to them, to us of grief.”"
2964,BOOK IV.,
2965,BOOK IV.,"He said, nor did the herald not obey,"
2966,BOOK IV.,"But through the brass-clad ranks of Greece he pass’d,"
2967,BOOK IV.,In search of brave Machaon; him he found
2968,BOOK IV.,"Standing, by buckler’d warriors bold begirt,"
2969,BOOK IV.,Who follow’d him from Trica’s grassy plains.
2970,BOOK IV.,"He stood beside him, and address’d him thus:"
2971,BOOK IV.,"“Up, son of Æsculapius! Atreus’ son,"
2972,BOOK IV.,"The mighty monarch, summons thee to see"
2973,BOOK IV.,"The warlike Menelaus, chief of Greeks,"
2974,BOOK IV.,"Who by an arrow from some practis’d hand,"
2975,BOOK IV.,"Trojan or Lycian, hath receiv’d a wound;"
2976,BOOK IV.,"A cause of boast to them, to us of grief.”"
2977,BOOK IV.,
2978,BOOK IV.,Thus he; and not unmov’d Machaon heard:
2979,BOOK IV.,"They thro’ the crowd, and thro’ the wide-spread host,"
2980,BOOK IV.,Together took their way; but when they came
2981,BOOK IV.,"Where fair-hair’d Menelaus, wounded, stood,"
2982,BOOK IV.,"Around him in a ring the best of Greece,"
2983,BOOK IV.,"And in the midst the godlike chief himself,"
2984,BOOK IV.,"From the close-fitting belt the shaft he drew,"
2985,BOOK IV.,Breaking the pointed barbs; the sparkling belt
2986,BOOK IV.,"He loosen’d, and the doublet underneath,"
2987,BOOK IV.,"And coat of mail, the work of arm’rer’s hand."
2988,BOOK IV.,"But when the wound appear’d in sight, where struck"
2989,BOOK IV.,"The stinging arrow, from the clotted blood"
2990,BOOK IV.,"He cleans’d it, and applied with skilful hand"
2991,BOOK IV.,"The herbs of healing power, which Chiron erst"
2992,BOOK IV.,In friendly guise upon his sire bestowed.
2993,BOOK IV.,
2994,BOOK IV.,While round the valiant Menelaus they
2995,BOOK IV.,"Were thus engag’d, advanc’d the Trojan hosts:"
2996,BOOK IV.,"They donn’d their arms, and for the fight prepar’d."
2997,BOOK IV.,In Agamemnon then no trace was seen
2998,BOOK IV.,"Of laggard sloth, no shrinking from the fight,"
2999,BOOK IV.,But full of ardour to the field he rush’d.
3000,BOOK IV.,He left his horses and brass-mounted car
3001,BOOK IV.,"(The champing horses by Eurymedon,"
3002,BOOK IV.,"The son of Ptolemy, Peiraeus’ son,"
3003,BOOK IV.,"Were held aloof), but with repeated charge"
3004,BOOK IV.,"Still to be near at hand, when faint with toil"
3005,BOOK IV.,His limbs should fail him marshalling his host.
3006,BOOK IV.,Himself on foot the warrior ranks array’d;
3007,BOOK IV.,With cheering words addressing whom he found
3008,BOOK IV.,With zeal preparing for the battle-field:
3009,BOOK IV.,"“Relax not, valiant friends, your warlike toil;"
3010,BOOK IV.,For Jove to falsehood ne’er will give his aid;
3011,BOOK IV.,"And they who first, regardless of their oaths,"
3012,BOOK IV.,"Have broken truce, shall with their flesh themselves"
3013,BOOK IV.,"The vultures feed, while we, their city raz’d,"
3014,BOOK IV.,Their wives and helpless children bear away.”
3015,BOOK IV.,
3016,BOOK IV.,But whom remiss and shrinking from the war
3017,BOOK IV.,"He found, with keen rebuke he thus assail’d;"
3018,BOOK IV.,"“Ye wretched Greeks, your country’s foul reproach,"
3019,BOOK IV.,Have ye no sense of shame? Why stand ye thus
3020,BOOK IV.,"Like timid fawns, that in the chase run down,"
3021,BOOK IV.,"Stand all bewildered, spiritless and tame?"
3022,BOOK IV.,"So stand ye now, nor dare to face the fight."
3023,BOOK IV.,"What! will ye wait the Trojans’ near approach,"
3024,BOOK IV.,"Where on the beach, beside the hoary deep,"
3025,BOOK IV.,"Our goodly ships are drawn, and see if Jove"
3026,BOOK IV.,Will o’er you his protecting hand extend?”
3027,BOOK IV.,
3028,BOOK IV.,"As thus the King the serried ranks review’d,"
3029,BOOK IV.,He came where thronging round their skilful chief
3030,BOOK IV.,"Idomeneus, the warlike bands of Crete"
3031,BOOK IV.,"Were arming for the fight; Idomeneus,"
3032,BOOK IV.,"Of courage stubborn as the forest boar,"
3033,BOOK IV.,The foremost ranks array’d; Meriones
3034,BOOK IV.,The rearmost squadrons had in charge; with joy
3035,BOOK IV.,"The monarch Agamemnon saw, and thus"
3036,BOOK IV.,With accents bland Idomeneus address’d:
3037,BOOK IV.,
3038,BOOK IV.,"“Idomeneus, above all other Greeks,"
3039,BOOK IV.,"In battle and elsewhere, I honour thee;"
3040,BOOK IV.,"And in the banquet, where the noblest mix"
3041,BOOK IV.,"The ruddy wine for chiefs alone reserved,"
3042,BOOK IV.,"Though others drink their share, yet by thy side"
3043,BOOK IV.,"Thy cup, like mine, still new replenished stands"
3044,BOOK IV.,"To drink at pleasure. Up then to the fight,"
3045,BOOK IV.,And show thyself the warrior that thou art.”
3046,BOOK IV.,
3047,BOOK IV.,"To whom the Cretan King, Idomeneus:"
3048,BOOK IV.,"“In me, Atrides, thou shalt ever find,"
3049,BOOK IV.,"As at the first I promis’d, comrade true;"
3050,BOOK IV.,"But go, and stir the other long-haired Greeks"
3051,BOOK IV.,To speedy battle; since the Trojans now
3052,BOOK IV.,The truce have broken; and defeat and death
3053,BOOK IV.,Must wait on those who have their oaths forsworn.”
3054,BOOK IV.,
3055,BOOK IV.,"He said, and Agamemnon went his way"
3056,BOOK IV.,"Rejoicing; through the crowd he pass’d, and came"
3057,BOOK IV.,"Where stood th’ Ajaces; them, in act to arm,"
3058,BOOK IV.,Amid a cloud of infantry he found;
3059,BOOK IV.,And as a goat-herd from his watch-tow’r crag
3060,BOOK IV.,"Beholds a cloud advancing o’er the sea,"
3061,BOOK IV.,By Zephyr’s breath impell’d; as from afar
3062,BOOK IV.,"He gazes, black as pitch, it sweeps along"
3063,BOOK IV.,"O’er the dark ocean’s face, and with it brings"
3064,BOOK IV.,"A hurricane of rain; he, shudd’ring, sees,"
3065,BOOK IV.,And drives his flock beneath the shelt’ring cave:
3066,BOOK IV.,"So thick and dark, about th’ Ajaces stirr’d,"
3067,BOOK IV.,"Impatient for the war, the stalwart youths,"
3068,BOOK IV.,"Black masses, bristling close with spear and shield."
3069,BOOK IV.,
3070,BOOK IV.,"Well pleas’d, the monarch Agamemnon saw,"
3071,BOOK IV.,"And thus address’d them: “Valiant chiefs, to you,"
3072,BOOK IV.,"The leaders of the brass-clad Greeks, I give"
3073,BOOK IV.,(’Twere needless and unseemly) no commands;
3074,BOOK IV.,For well ye understand your troops to rouse
3075,BOOK IV.,"To deeds of dauntless courage; would to Jove,"
3076,BOOK IV.,"To Pallas and Apollo, that such mind"
3077,BOOK IV.,"As is in you, in all the camp were found;"
3078,BOOK IV.,"Then soon should Priam’s lofty city fall,"
3079,BOOK IV.,Tak’n and destroy’d by our victorious hands.”
3080,BOOK IV.,
3081,BOOK IV.,"Thus saying, them he left, and onward mov’d."
3082,BOOK IV.,"Nestor, the smooth-tongu’d Pylian chief, he found"
3083,BOOK IV.,"The troops arraying, and to valiant deeds"
3084,BOOK IV.,"His friends encouraging; stout Pelagon,"
3085,BOOK IV.,"Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, warlike Prince,"
3086,BOOK IV.,"And Bias bold, his people’s sure defence."
3087,BOOK IV.,"In the front rank, with chariot and with horse,"
3088,BOOK IV.,"He plac’d the car-borne warriors; in the rear,"
3089,BOOK IV.,"Num’rous and brave, a cloud of infantry,"
3090,BOOK IV.,"Compactly mass’d, to stem the tide of war,"
3091,BOOK IV.,"Between the two he plac’d th’ inferior troops,"
3092,BOOK IV.,That e’en against their will they needs must fight.
3093,BOOK IV.,"The horsemen first he charg’d, and bade them keep"
3094,BOOK IV.,"Their horses well in hand, nor wildly rush"
3095,BOOK IV.,"Amid the tumult: “See,” he said, “that none,"
3096,BOOK IV.,"In skill or valour over-confident,"
3097,BOOK IV.,"Advance before his comrades, nor alone"
3098,BOOK IV.,Retire; for so your lines were easier forc’d;
3099,BOOK IV.,"But ranging each beside a hostile car,"
3100,BOOK IV.,Thrust with your spears; for such the better way;
3101,BOOK IV.,"By men so disciplin’d, in elder days"
3102,BOOK IV.,Were lofty walls and fenced towns destroy’d.”
3103,BOOK IV.,
3104,BOOK IV.,"Thus he, experienc’d in the wars of old;"
3105,BOOK IV.,"Well pleas’d, the monarch Agamemnon saw,"
3106,BOOK IV.,"And thus address’d him; “Would to Heav’n, old man,"
3107,BOOK IV.,"That, as thy spirit, such too were thy strength"
3108,BOOK IV.,"And vigour of thy limbs; but now old age,"
3109,BOOK IV.,"The common lot of mortals, weighs thee down;"
3110,BOOK IV.,"Would I could see some others in thy place,"
3111,BOOK IV.,And thou couldst still be numbered with the young!”
3112,BOOK IV.,
3113,BOOK IV.,To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
3114,BOOK IV.,"“Atrides, I too fain would see restor’d"
3115,BOOK IV.,"The strength I once possess’d, what time I slew"
3116,BOOK IV.,The godlike Ereuthalion; but the Gods
3117,BOOK IV.,On man bestow not all their gifts at once;
3118,BOOK IV.,"I then was young, and now am bow’d with age,"
3119,BOOK IV.,"Yet with the chariots can I still go forth,"
3120,BOOK IV.,And aid with sage advice: for such the right
3121,BOOK IV.,And privilege of age; to hurl the spear
3122,BOOK IV.,"Belongs to younger men, who after me"
3123,BOOK IV.,"Were born, who boast their vigour unimpair’d.”"
3124,BOOK IV.,
3125,BOOK IV.,"He said; and Agamemnon went his way,"
3126,BOOK IV.,"Rejoicing: to Menestheus next he came,"
3127,BOOK IV.,"The son of Peteus, charioteer renown’d;"
3128,BOOK IV.,"Him found he, circled by th’ Athenian bands,"
3129,BOOK IV.,The raisers of the war-cry; close beside
3130,BOOK IV.,"The sage Ulysses stood, around him rang’d,"
3131,BOOK IV.,"Not unrenown’d, the Cephalonian troops:"
3132,BOOK IV.,The sound of battle had not reach’d their ears;
3133,BOOK IV.,For but of late the Greek and Trojan hosts
3134,BOOK IV.,"Were set in motion; they expecting stood,"
3135,BOOK IV.,"Till other Grecian columns should advance,"
3136,BOOK IV.,"Assail the Trojans, and renew the war."
3137,BOOK IV.,
3138,BOOK IV.,"Atrides saw, and thus, reproachful, spoke:"
3139,BOOK IV.,"“O son of Peteus, Heav’n-descended King!"
3140,BOOK IV.,"And thou too, master of all tricky arts,"
3141,BOOK IV.,"Why, ling’ring, stand ye thus aloof, and wait"
3142,BOOK IV.,For others coming? ye should be the first
3143,BOOK IV.,The hot assault of battle to confront;
3144,BOOK IV.,"For ye are first my summons to receive,"
3145,BOOK IV.,Whene’er the honour’d banquet we prepare:
3146,BOOK IV.,"And well ye like to eat the sav’ry meat,"
3147,BOOK IV.,"And, at your will, the luscious wine-cups drain:"
3148,BOOK IV.,"Now stand ye here, and unconcern’d would see"
3149,BOOK IV.,Ten columns pass before you to the fight.”
3150,BOOK IV.,
3151,BOOK IV.,"To whom, with stern regard, Ulysses thus:"
3152,BOOK IV.,"“What words have pass’d the barrier of thy lips,"
3153,BOOK IV.,Atrides? how with want of warlike zeal
3154,BOOK IV.,Canst thou reproach us? when the Greeks again
3155,BOOK IV.,"The furious war shall waken, thou shalt see"
3156,BOOK IV.,(If that thou care to see) amid the ranks
3157,BOOK IV.,"Of Troy, the father of Telemachus"
3158,BOOK IV.,In the fore-front: thy words are empty wind.”
3159,BOOK IV.,
3160,BOOK IV.,"Atrides saw him chafed, and smiling, thus"
3161,BOOK IV.,"Recalled his former words: “Ulysses sage,"
3162,BOOK IV.,"Laertes’ high-born son, not over-much"
3163,BOOK IV.,"I give thee blame, or orders; for I know"
3164,BOOK IV.,Thy mind to gentle counsels is inclin’d;
3165,BOOK IV.,"Thy thoughts are one with mine; then come, henceforth"
3166,BOOK IV.,Shall all be well; and if a hasty word
3167,BOOK IV.,"Have pass’d, may Heaven regard it as unsaid.”"
3168,BOOK IV.,
3169,BOOK IV.,"Thus saying, them he left, and onward mov’d."
3170,BOOK IV.,"The son of Tydeus, valiant Diomed,"
3171,BOOK IV.,Standing he found amid his warlike steeds
3172,BOOK IV.,"And well-built cars; beside him, Sthenelus,"
3173,BOOK IV.,"The son of Capaneus; Atrides saw,"
3174,BOOK IV.,And thus address’d him with reproachful words:
3175,BOOK IV.,"“Alas! thou son of Tydeus, wise and bold,"
3176,BOOK IV.,Why crouch with fear? why thus appall’d survey
3177,BOOK IV.,The pass of war? not so had Tydeus crouch’d;
3178,BOOK IV.,His hand was ever ready from their foes
3179,BOOK IV.,"To guard his comrades; so, at least, they say"
3180,BOOK IV.,Whose eyes beheld his labours; I myself
3181,BOOK IV.,"Nor met him e’er, nor saw; but, by report,"
3182,BOOK IV.,Thy father was the foremost man of men.
3183,BOOK IV.,"A stranger to Mycenæ once he came,"
3184,BOOK IV.,"With godlike Polynices; not at war,"
3185,BOOK IV.,But seeking succour for the troops that lay
3186,BOOK IV.,Encamp’d before the sacred walls of Thebes;
3187,BOOK IV.,For reinforcements earnestly they sued;
3188,BOOK IV.,"The boon they ask’d was granted them, but Jove"
3189,BOOK IV.,With unpropitious omens turn’d them back.
3190,BOOK IV.,"Advancing on their journey, when they reach’d"
3191,BOOK IV.,"Asopus’ grassy banks and rushes deep,"
3192,BOOK IV.,The Greeks upon a mission Tydeus sent:
3193,BOOK IV.,He went; and many Thebans there he found
3194,BOOK IV.,Feasting in Eteocles’ royal hall:
3195,BOOK IV.,"Amid them all, a stranger and alone,"
3196,BOOK IV.,"He stood unterrified, and challeng’d all"
3197,BOOK IV.,"To wrestle with him, and with ease o’erthrew:"
3198,BOOK IV.,So mighty was the aid that Pallas gave.
3199,BOOK IV.,"Whereat indignant, they, on his return,"
3200,BOOK IV.,"An ambush set, of fifty chosen youths;"
3201,BOOK IV.,"Two were their leaders; Haemon’s godlike son,"
3202,BOOK IV.,"Maeon, and Lycophontes, warrior brave,"
3203,BOOK IV.,Son of Autophonus; and these too far’d
3204,BOOK IV.,But ill at Tydeus’ hand; he slew them all:
3205,BOOK IV.,"Maeon alone, obedient to the Gods,"
3206,BOOK IV.,"He spar’d, and bade him bear the tidings home."
3207,BOOK IV.,"Such Tydeus was: though greater in debate,"
3208,BOOK IV.,His son will never rival him in arms.”
3209,BOOK IV.,
3210,BOOK IV.,"He said: brave Diomed in silence heard,"
3211,BOOK IV.,Submissive to the monarch’s stern rebuke;
3212,BOOK IV.,Then answer’d thus the son of Capaneus:
3213,BOOK IV.,"“Atrides, speak not falsely: well thou know’st"
3214,BOOK IV.,"The truth, that we our fathers far surpass."
3215,BOOK IV.,"The seven-gated city, Thebes, we took,"
3216,BOOK IV.,"With smaller force beneath the wall of Mars,"
3217,BOOK IV.,"Trusting to heav’nly signs, and fav’ring Jove,"
3218,BOOK IV.,"Where they by blind, presumptuous folly fail’d;"
3219,BOOK IV.,Then equal not our fathers’ deeds with ours.”
3220,BOOK IV.,
3221,BOOK IV.,"To whom thus Diomed, with stern regard:"
3222,BOOK IV.,"“Father, be silent; hearken to my words:"
3223,BOOK IV.,"I blame not Agamemnon, King of men,"
3224,BOOK IV.,Who thus to battle stirs the well-greav’d Greeks:
3225,BOOK IV.,His will the glory be if we o’ercome
3226,BOOK IV.,"The valiant Trojans, and their city take;"
3227,BOOK IV.,Great too his loss if they o’er us prevail:
3228,BOOK IV.,"Then come, let us too for the fight prepare.”"
3229,BOOK IV.,
3230,BOOK IV.,He said; and from the car leap’d down in arms:
3231,BOOK IV.,"Fierce rang the armour on the warrior’s breast,"
3232,BOOK IV.,That ev’n the stoutest heart might quail with fear.
3233,BOOK IV.,
3234,BOOK IV.,"As by the west wind driv’n, the ocean waves"
3235,BOOK IV.,"Dash forward on the far-resounding shore,"
3236,BOOK IV.,Wave upon wave; first curls the ruffled sea
3237,BOOK IV.,With whit’ning crests; anon with thund’ring roar
3238,BOOK IV.,"It breaks upon the beach, and from the crags"
3239,BOOK IV.,Recoiling flings in giant curves its head
3240,BOOK IV.,"Aloft, and tosses high the wild sea-spray:"
3241,BOOK IV.,"Column on column, so the hosts of Greece"
3242,BOOK IV.,"Pour’d, ceaseless, to the war; to each the chiefs"
3243,BOOK IV.,Their orders gave; the rest in silence mov’d:
3244,BOOK IV.,Nor would ye deem that mighty mass endued
3245,BOOK IV.,"With power of speech, so silently they moved"
3246,BOOK IV.,In awe of their great captains: far around
3247,BOOK IV.,Flashed the bright armour they were girt withal.
3248,BOOK IV.,
3249,BOOK IV.,"On th’ other hand, the Trojans, as the flocks"
3250,BOOK IV.,That in the court-yard of some wealthy Lord
3251,BOOK IV.,"In countless numbers stand, at milking-time,"
3252,BOOK IV.,"Incessant bleating, as their lambs they hear;"
3253,BOOK IV.,So rose their mingled clamours through the camp;
3254,BOOK IV.,"For not one language nor one speech was there,"
3255,BOOK IV.,But many nations call’d from distant lands:
3256,BOOK IV.,"These Mars inspir’d, and those the blue-ey’d Maid;"
3257,BOOK IV.,"And Fear, and Flight, and Discord unappeas’d,"
3258,BOOK IV.,Of blood-stain’d Mars the sister and the friend:
3259,BOOK IV.,"“With humble crest at first, anon her head,"
3260,BOOK IV.,"“While yet she treads the earth, affronts the skies."
3261,BOOK IV.,"The gage of battle in the midst she threw,"
3262,BOOK IV.,"Strode through the crowd, and woe to mortals wrought."
3263,BOOK IV.,"When to the midst they came, together rush’d"
3264,BOOK IV.,"Bucklers and lances, and the furious might"
3265,BOOK IV.,Of mail-clad warriors; bossy shield on shield
3266,BOOK IV.,Clatter’d in conflict; loud the clamour rose.
3267,BOOK IV.,Then rose too mingled shouts and groans of men
3268,BOOK IV.,Slaying and slain; the earth ran red with blood.
3269,BOOK IV.,"As when, descending from the mountain’s brow,"
3270,BOOK IV.,"Two wintry torrents, from their copious source"
3271,BOOK IV.,"Pour downward to the narrow pass, where meet"
3272,BOOK IV.,"Their mingled waters in some deep ravine,"
3273,BOOK IV.,Their weight of flood; on the far mountain’s side
3274,BOOK IV.,The shepherd hears the roar; so loud arose
3275,BOOK IV.,The shouts and yells of those commingling hosts.
3276,BOOK IV.,
3277,BOOK IV.,First ’mid the foremost ranks Antilochus
3278,BOOK IV.,"A Trojan warrior, Echepolus, slew,"
3279,BOOK IV.,"A crested chief, Thalesius’ noble son."
3280,BOOK IV.,Beneath his horsehair-plumed helmet’s peak
3281,BOOK IV.,The sharp spear struck; deep in his forehead fix’d
3282,BOOK IV.,"It pierc’d the bone; then darkness veil’d his eyes,"
3283,BOOK IV.,"And, like a tow’r, amid the press he fell."
3284,BOOK IV.,"Him Elephenor, brave Abantian chief,"
3285,BOOK IV.,"Son of Chalcodon, seizing by the feet,"
3286,BOOK IV.,"Dragg’d from beneath the darts, in haste to strip"
3287,BOOK IV.,His armour off; but short-liv’d was th’ attempt;
3288,BOOK IV.,For bold Agenor mark’d him as he drew
3289,BOOK IV.,"The corpse aside, and with his brass-tipp’d spear"
3290,BOOK IV.,"Thrust through his flank, unguarded, as he stoop’d,"
3291,BOOK IV.,Beside his shield; and slack’d his limbs in death.
3292,BOOK IV.,The spirit was fled; but hotly o’er him rag’d
3293,BOOK IV.,The war of Greeks and Trojans; fierce as wolves
3294,BOOK IV.,"They fought, man struggling hand to hand with man."
3295,BOOK IV.,
3296,BOOK IV.,"Then Ajax Telamon a stalwart youth,"
3297,BOOK IV.,"Son of Anthemion, Simoisius, slew;"
3298,BOOK IV.,"Whose mother gave him birth on Simois’ banks,"
3299,BOOK IV.,When with her parents down from Ida’s heights
3300,BOOK IV.,She drove her flock; thence Simoisius nam’d:
3301,BOOK IV.,Not destined he his parents to repay
3302,BOOK IV.,"Their early care; for short his term of life,"
3303,BOOK IV.,By godlike Ajax’ mighty spear subdued.
3304,BOOK IV.,"Him, to the front advancing, in the breast,"
3305,BOOK IV.,"By the right nipple, Ajax struck; right through,"
3306,BOOK IV.,"From front to back, the brass-tipp’d spear was driv’n,"
3307,BOOK IV.,Out through the shoulder; prone in dust he fell;
3308,BOOK IV.,"As some tall poplar, grown in marshy mead,"
3309,BOOK IV.,"Smooth-stemm’d, with branches tapering tow’rd the head;"
3310,BOOK IV.,"Which with the biting axe the wheelwright fells,"
3311,BOOK IV.,To bend the felloes of his well-built car;
3312,BOOK IV.,"Sapless, beside the river, lies the tree;"
3313,BOOK IV.,"So lay the youthful Simoisius, felled"
3314,BOOK IV.,"By godlike Ajax’ hand. At him, in turn,"
3315,BOOK IV.,"The son of Priam, Antiphus, encas’d"
3316,BOOK IV.,"In radiant armour, from amid the crowd"
3317,BOOK IV.,"His jav’lin threw; his mark, indeed, he miss’d;"
3318,BOOK IV.,"But through the groin Ulysses’ faithful friend,"
3319,BOOK IV.,"Leucus, he struck, in act to bear away"
3320,BOOK IV.,"The youthful dead; down on the corpse he fell,"
3321,BOOK IV.,"And, dying, of the dead relax’d his grasp."
3322,BOOK IV.,"Fierce anger, at his comrade’s slaughter, filled"
3323,BOOK IV.,Ulysses’ breast; in burnished armour clad
3324,BOOK IV.,"Forward he rush’d; and standing near, around"
3325,BOOK IV.,"He look’d, and pois’d on high his glitt’ring lance:"
3326,BOOK IV.,Beneath his aim the Trojans back recoil’d;
3327,BOOK IV.,"Nor vainly flew the spear; Democoon,"
3328,BOOK IV.,"A bastard son of Priam, met the blow:"
3329,BOOK IV.,"He from Abydos came, his high-bred mares"
3330,BOOK IV.,"There left to pasture; him Ulysses, fill’d"
3331,BOOK IV.,"With fury at his lov’d companion’s death,"
3332,BOOK IV.,Smote on the head; through either temple pass’d
3333,BOOK IV.,"The pointed spear, and darkness veil’d his eyes."
3334,BOOK IV.,"Thund’ring he fell, and loud his armour rang."
3335,BOOK IV.,"At this the Trojan chiefs, and Hector’s self,"
3336,BOOK IV.,’Gan to give ground: the Greeks with joyful shouts
3337,BOOK IV.,"Seiz’d on the dead, and forward urg’d their course."
3338,BOOK IV.,"From Ilium’s heights Apollo, filled with wrath,"
3339,BOOK IV.,"Look’d down, and to the Trojans shouted loud:"
3340,BOOK IV.,"“Uprouse ye, valiant Trojans! give not way"
3341,BOOK IV.,"Before the Greeks; their bodies are not stone,"
3342,BOOK IV.,"Nor iron, to defy your trenchant swords;"
3343,BOOK IV.,"And great Achilles, fair-hair’d Thetis’ son,"
3344,BOOK IV.,"Fights not, but o’er his anger broods apart.”"
3345,BOOK IV.,So from the city call’d the heav’nly voice;
3346,BOOK IV.,"The Greeks, meanwhile, all-glorious Pallas fir’d,"
3347,BOOK IV.,"Mov’d ’mid the tumult, and the laggards rous’d."
3348,BOOK IV.,
3349,BOOK IV.,"Then fell Diores, Amarynceus’ son:"
3350,BOOK IV.,A rugged fragment of a rock had crush’d
3351,BOOK IV.,His ancle and right leg; from Ænon came
3352,BOOK IV.,"The Thracian chief who hurl’d it, Peirous, son"
3353,BOOK IV.,"Of Imbrasus; the tendons both, and bones,"
3354,BOOK IV.,The huge mass shatter’d; backward in the dust
3355,BOOK IV.,"He fell, both hands extending to his friends,"
3356,BOOK IV.,Gasping his life away; then quick up-ran
3357,BOOK IV.,"He who the blow had dealt, and with his spear"
3358,BOOK IV.,"Thrust through him, by the navel; from the wound"
3359,BOOK IV.,"His bowels gush’d, and darkness veil’d his eyes."
3360,BOOK IV.,
3361,BOOK IV.,"But he, advancing, through the breast was struck"
3362,BOOK IV.,"Above the nipple, by th’ Ætolian chief."
3363,BOOK IV.,Thoas; and through his lungs the spear was driv’n.
3364,BOOK IV.,"Thoas approach’d, and from his breast withdrew"
3365,BOOK IV.,"The sturdy spear, and with his sharp-edg’d sword"
3366,BOOK IV.,Across his waistband gave the mortal stroke:
3367,BOOK IV.,Yet could not touch his arms; for all around
3368,BOOK IV.,"The Thracian warriors, with, their tufted crowns,"
3369,BOOK IV.,"Their long spears held before them, him, though stout,"
3370,BOOK IV.,"And strong, and valiant, kept at bay; perforce"
3371,BOOK IV.,He yielded; and thus side by side were laid
3372,BOOK IV.,"The two, the Thracian and th’ Epeian chief;"
3373,BOOK IV.,And round them many a valiant soldier lay.
3374,BOOK IV.,
3375,BOOK IV.,Well might the deeds achieved that day deserve
3376,BOOK IV.,"His praise, who through that bloody field might pass"
3377,BOOK IV.,"By sword or spear unwounded, by the hand"
3378,BOOK IV.,Of Pallas guarded from the weapon’s flight;
3379,BOOK IV.,"For many a Trojan, many a Greek, that day"
3380,BOOK IV.,"Prone in the dust, and side by side, were laid."

3421,BOOK V.,"Two gallant sons he had, Idaeus nam’d,"
3422,BOOK V.,"And Phegeus, skill’d in all the points of war."
3423,BOOK V.,"These, parted from the throng, the warrior met;"
3424,BOOK V.,"They on their car, while he on foot advanc’d."
3425,BOOK V.,"When near they came, first Phegeus threw his spear;"
3426,BOOK V.,O’er the left shoulder of Tydides pass’d
3427,BOOK V.,"The erring weapon’s point, and miss’d its mark."
3428,BOOK V.,"His pond’rous spear in turn Tydides threw,"
3429,BOOK V.,"And not in vain; on Phegeus’ breast it struck,"
3430,BOOK V.,"Full in the midst, and hurl’d him from the car."
3431,BOOK V.,"Idaeus from the well-wrought chariot sprang,"
3432,BOOK V.,"And fled, nor durst his brother’s corpse defend."
3433,BOOK V.,"Nor had he so escap’d the doom of death,"
3434,BOOK V.,"But Vulcan bore him safely from the field,"
3435,BOOK V.,"In darkness shrouded, that his aged sire"
3436,BOOK V.,Might not be wholly of his sons bereav’d.
3437,BOOK V.,"The car Tydides to his comrades gave,"
3438,BOOK V.,And bade them to the ships the horses drive.
3439,BOOK V.,
3440,BOOK V.,"Now when the Trojans Dares’ sons beheld,"
3441,BOOK V.,"The one in flight, the other stretch’d in death,"
3442,BOOK V.,Their spirits within them quail’d; but Pallas took
3443,BOOK V.,"The hand of Mars, and thus address’d the God:"
3444,BOOK V.,"“Mars, Mars, thou bane of mortals, blood-stain’d Lord,"
3445,BOOK V.,"Razer of cities, wherefore leave we not"
3446,BOOK V.,"The Greeks and Trojans to contend, and see"
3447,BOOK V.,To which the sire of all will vict’ry give;
3448,BOOK V.,"While we retire, and shun the wrath of Jove?”"
3449,BOOK V.,
3450,BOOK V.,"Thus saying, from the battle Mars she led,"
3451,BOOK V.,And plac’d him on Scamander’s steepy banks.
3452,BOOK V.,
3453,BOOK V.,The Greeks drove back the Trojan host; the chiefs
3454,BOOK V.,"Slew each his victim; Agamemnon first,"
3455,BOOK V.,"The mighty monarch, from his chariot hurl’d"
3456,BOOK V.,"Hodius, the sturdy Halizonian chief,"
3457,BOOK V.,"Him, as he turn’d, between the shoulder-blades"
3458,BOOK V.,"The jav’lin struck, and through his chest was driv’n;"
3459,BOOK V.,"Thund’ring he fell, and loud his armour rang."
3460,BOOK V.,
3461,BOOK V.,"On Phaestus, Borus’ son, Maeonian chief,"
3462,BOOK V.,"Who from the fertile plains of Tarna came,"
3463,BOOK V.,Then sprang Idomeneus; and as he sought
3464,BOOK V.,"To mount upon his car, the Cretan King"
3465,BOOK V.,Through his right shoulder drove the pointed spear;
3466,BOOK V.,"He fell; the shades of death his eyes o’erspread,"
3467,BOOK V.,And of his arms the followers stripp’d his corpse.
3468,BOOK V.,
3469,BOOK V.,"The son of Atreus, Menelaus, slew"
3470,BOOK V.,"Scamandrius, son of Strophius, sportsman keen,"
3471,BOOK V.,In woodcraft skilful; for his practis’d hand
3472,BOOK V.,Had by Diana’s self been taught to slay
3473,BOOK V.,Each beast of chase the mountain forest holds.
3474,BOOK V.,But nought avail’d him then the Archer-Queen
3475,BOOK V.,"Diana’s counsels, nor his boasted art"
3476,BOOK V.,"Of distant aim; for as he fled, the lance"
3477,BOOK V.,"Of Menelaus, Atreus’ warlike son,"
3478,BOOK V.,"Behind his neck, between the shoulder-blades,"
3479,BOOK V.,"His flight arresting, through his chest was driv’n."
3480,BOOK V.,"Headlong he fell, and loud his armour rang."
3481,BOOK V.,
3482,BOOK V.,"Phereclus by Meriones was slain,"
3483,BOOK V.,"Son of Harmonides, whose practis’d hand"
3484,BOOK V.,Knew well to fashion many a work of art;
3485,BOOK V.,By Pallas highly favour’d; he the ships
3486,BOOK V.,"For Paris built, first origin of ill,"
3487,BOOK V.,"Freighted with evil to the men of Troy,"
3488,BOOK V.,"And to himself, who knew not Heav’n’s decrees."
3489,BOOK V.,"Him, in his headlong flight, in hot pursuit"
3490,BOOK V.,"Meriones o’ertook, and thrust his lance"
3491,BOOK V.,Through his right flank; beneath the bone was driv’n
3492,BOOK V.,"The spear, and pierc’d him through: prone on his knees,"
3493,BOOK V.,"Groaning, he fell, and death his eyelids clos’d."
3494,BOOK V.,
3495,BOOK V.,"Meges Pedaeus slew, Antenor’s son,"
3496,BOOK V.,"A bastard born, but by Theano rear’d"
3497,BOOK V.,"With tender care, and nurtur’d as her son,"
3498,BOOK V.,"With her own children, for her husband’s sake."
3499,BOOK V.,"Him, Phyleus’ warrior son, approaching near,"
3500,BOOK V.,Thrust through the junction of the head and neck;
3501,BOOK V.,Crash’d through his teeth the spear beneath the tongue;
3502,BOOK V.,Prone in the dust he gnash’d the brazen point.
3503,BOOK V.,
3504,BOOK V.,"Eurypylus, Euaemon’s noble son,"
3505,BOOK V.,"Hypsenor slew, the worthy progeny"
3506,BOOK V.,"Of Dolopion brave; Scamander’s priest,"
3507,BOOK V.,And by the people as a God rever’d:
3508,BOOK V.,"Him, as he fled before him, from behind"
3509,BOOK V.,"Eurypylus, Euaemon’s noble son,"
3510,BOOK V.,Smote with the sword; and from the shoulder-point
3511,BOOK V.,The brawny arm he sever’d; to the ground
3512,BOOK V.,Down fell the gory hand; the darkling shades
3513,BOOK V.,"Of death, and rig’rous doom, his eyelids clos’d."
3514,BOOK V.,
3515,BOOK V.,Thus labour’d they amid the stubborn fight;
3516,BOOK V.,But of Tydides none might say to whom
3517,BOOK V.,"His arm belong’d, or whether with the hosts"
3518,BOOK V.,Of Troy or Greece he mingled in the fight:
3519,BOOK V.,"Hither and thither o’er the plain he rush’d,"
3520,BOOK V.,"Like to a wintry stream, that brimming o’er"
3521,BOOK V.,Breaks down its barriers in its rapid course;
3522,BOOK V.,"Nor well-built bridge can stem the flood, nor fence"
3523,BOOK V.,"guards the fertile fields, as down it pours"
3524,BOOK V.,"Its sudden torrent, swoll’n with rain from Heav’n,"
3525,BOOK V.,And many a goodly work of man destroys:
3526,BOOK V.,So back were borne before Tydides’ might
3527,BOOK V.,"The serried ranks of Troy, nor dar’d await,"
3528,BOOK V.,"Despite their numbers, his impetuous charge."
3529,BOOK V.,
3530,BOOK V.,Him when Lycaon’s noble son beheld
3531,BOOK V.,"Careering o’er the plain, the serried ranks"
3532,BOOK V.,"Driving before him, quick at Tydeus’ son"
3533,BOOK V.,"He bent his bow; and onward as he rush’d,"
3534,BOOK V.,"On the right shoulder, near the breastplate’s joint,"
3535,BOOK V.,"The stinging arrow struck; right through it pass’d,"
3536,BOOK V.,"And held its way, that blood the breastplate stain’d."
3537,BOOK V.,Then shouted loud Lycaon’s noble son:
3538,BOOK V.,"“Arouse ye, valiant Trojans, ye who goad"
3539,BOOK V.,Your flying steeds; the bravest of the Greeks
3540,BOOK V.,"Is wounded, nor, I deem, can long withstand"
3541,BOOK V.,"My weapon, if indeed from Lycia’s shore"
3542,BOOK V.,By Phoebus’ counsel sent I join’d the war.”
3543,BOOK V.,
3544,BOOK V.,"Thus he, vain-glorious; but not so was quell’d"
3545,BOOK V.,"The godlike chief; back he withdrew, and stood"
3546,BOOK V.,"Beside his car, and thus to Sthenelus,"
3547,BOOK V.,"The son of Capaneus, his speech address’d:"
3548,BOOK V.,"“Up, gentle son of Capaneus, descend"
3549,BOOK V.,"From off the car, and from my shoulder draw"
3550,BOOK V.,"This stinging arrow forth.” He said, and down"
3551,BOOK V.,"Leap’d from the chariot Sthenelus, and stood"
3552,BOOK V.,"Beside him; and as forth he drew the shaft,"
3553,BOOK V.,"Gush’d out the blood, and dyed the twisted mail."
3554,BOOK V.,Then thus the valiant son of Tydeus pray’d:
3555,BOOK V.,"“Hear me, thou child of aegis-bearing Jove,"
3556,BOOK V.,Unconquer’d! if amid the deadly fight
3557,BOOK V.,"Thy friendly aid my father e’er sustain’d,"
3558,BOOK V.,Let me in turn thy favour find; and grant
3559,BOOK V.,Within my reach and compass of my spear
3560,BOOK V.,"That man may find himself, who unawares"
3561,BOOK V.,"Hath wounded me, and vainly boasting deems"
3562,BOOK V.,I shall not long behold the light of day.”
3563,BOOK V.,"Thus pray’d the chief, and Pallas heard his pray’r;"
3564,BOOK V.,"To all his limbs, to feet and hands alike,"
3565,BOOK V.,"She gave fresh vigour; and with winged words,"
3566,BOOK V.,"Beside him as she stood, address’d him thus:"
3567,BOOK V.,
3568,BOOK V.,"“Go fearless onward, Diomed, to meet"
3569,BOOK V.,The Trojan hosts; for I within thy breast
3570,BOOK V.,"Thy father’s dauntless courage have infus’d,"
3571,BOOK V.,"Such as of old in Tydeus’ bosom dwelt,"
3572,BOOK V.,"Bold horseman, buckler-clad; and from thine eyes"
3573,BOOK V.,"The film that dimm’d them I have purg’d away,"
3574,BOOK V.,That thou mayst well ’twixt Gods and men discern.
3575,BOOK V.,"If then some God make trial of thy force,"
3576,BOOK V.,With other of th’ Immortals fight thou not;
3577,BOOK V.,But should Jove’s daughter Venus dare the fray
3578,BOOK V.,Thou needst not shun at her to cast thy spear.”
3579,BOOK V.,
3580,BOOK V.,"This said, the blue-ey’d Goddess disappear’d."
3581,BOOK V.,Forthwith again amid the foremost ranks
3582,BOOK V.,Tydides mingled; keenly as before
3583,BOOK V.,"His spirit against the Trojans burn’d to fight,"
3584,BOOK V.,With threefold fury now he sought the fray.
3585,BOOK V.,As when a hungry lion has o’erleap’d
3586,BOOK V.,The sheepfold; him the guardian of the flock
3587,BOOK V.,"Has wounded, not disabled; by his wound"
3588,BOOK V.,"To rage excited, but not forc’d to fly,"
3589,BOOK V.,"The fold he enters, scares the trembling sheep,"
3590,BOOK V.,"That, closely huddled, each on other press,"
3591,BOOK V.,"Then pounces on his prey, and leaps the fence:"
3592,BOOK V.,So pounc’d Tydides on the Trojan host.
3593,BOOK V.,"Astynous and Hypeiron then he slew,"
3594,BOOK V.,His people’s guardian; through the breast of one
3595,BOOK V.,"He drove his spear, and with his mighty sword"
3596,BOOK V.,"He smote the other on the collar-bone,"
3597,BOOK V.,The shoulder sev’ring from the neck and back.
3598,BOOK V.,Them left he there to lie; of Abas then
3599,BOOK V.,"And Polyeidus went in hot pursuit,"
3600,BOOK V.,"Sons of Eurydamas, an aged seer,"
3601,BOOK V.,Whose visions stay’d them not; but both were doom’d
3602,BOOK V.,A prey to valiant Diomed to fall.
3603,BOOK V.,"Xanthus and Thoon then the hero slew,"
3604,BOOK V.,"The sons of Phaenops, children of his age:"
3605,BOOK V.,"He, worn with years, no other sons begot,"
3606,BOOK V.,"Heirs of his wealth; they two together fell,"
3607,BOOK V.,"And to their father left a load of grief,"
3608,BOOK V.,"That from the battle they return’d not home,"
3609,BOOK V.,And distant kindred all his substance shar’d.
3610,BOOK V.,"On Chromius and Echemon next he fell,"
3611,BOOK V.,Two sons of Priam on one chariot borne;
3612,BOOK V.,"And as a lion springs upon a herd,"
3613,BOOK V.,"And breaks the neck of heifer or of steer,"
3614,BOOK V.,Feeding in woodland glade; with such a spring
3615,BOOK V.,"These two, in vain resisting, from their car"
3616,BOOK V.,"Tydides hurl’d; then stripp’d their arms, and bade"
3617,BOOK V.,His followers lead their horses to the ships.
3618,BOOK V.,
3619,BOOK V.,Him when Æneas saw amid the ranks
3620,BOOK V.,"Dealing destruction, through the fight and throng"
3621,BOOK V.,"Of spears he plung’d, if haply he might find"
3622,BOOK V.,The godlike Pandarus; Lycaon’s son
3623,BOOK V.,"He found, of noble birth and stalwart form,"
3624,BOOK V.,"And stood before him, and address’d him thus:"
3625,BOOK V.,"“Where, Pandarus, are now thy winged shafts,"
3626,BOOK V.,"Thy bow, and well-known skill, wherein with thee"
3627,BOOK V.,"Can no man here contend? nor Lycia boasts,"
3628,BOOK V.,"Through all her wide-spread plains, a truer aim;"
3629,BOOK V.,"Then raise to Jove thy hands, and with thy shaft"
3630,BOOK V.,"Strike down this chief, whoe’er he be, that thus"
3631,BOOK V.,"Is making fearful havoc in our host,"
3632,BOOK V.,Relaxing many a warrior’s limbs in death:
3633,BOOK V.,"If he be not indeed a God, incens’d"
3634,BOOK V.,Against the Trojans for neglected rites;
3635,BOOK V.,For fearful is the vengeance of a God.”
3636,BOOK V.,
3637,BOOK V.,Whom answer’d thus Lycaon’s noble son:
3638,BOOK V.,"“Æneas, chief and councillor of Troy,"
3639,BOOK V.,Most like in all respects to Tydeus’ son
3640,BOOK V.,"He seems; his shield I know, and visor’d helm,"
3641,BOOK V.,"And horses; whether he himself be God,"
3642,BOOK V.,I cannot tell; but if he be indeed
3643,BOOK V.,"The man I think him, Tydeus’ valiant son,"
3644,BOOK V.,He fights not thus without the aid of Heav’n;
3645,BOOK V.,"But by his side, his shoulders veiled in cloud,"
3646,BOOK V.,"Some God attends his steps, and turns away"
3647,BOOK V.,The shaft that just hath reach’d him; for ev’n now
3648,BOOK V.,"A shaft I shot, which by the breastplate’s joint"
3649,BOOK V.,Pierc’d his right shoulder through: full sure I deem’d
3650,BOOK V.,"That shaft had sent him to the shades, and yet"
3651,BOOK V.,It slew him not; ’tis sure some angry God.
3652,BOOK V.,"Nor horse have I, nor car on which to mount;"
3653,BOOK V.,But in my sire Lycaon’s wealthy house
3654,BOOK V.,"Elev’n fair chariots stand, all newly built,"
3655,BOOK V.,Each with its cover; by the side of each
3656,BOOK V.,Two steeds on rye and barley white are fed;
3657,BOOK V.,"And in his well-built house, when here I came,"
3658,BOOK V.,"Lycaon, aged warrior, urg’d me oft"
3659,BOOK V.,"With horses and with chariots high upborne,"
3660,BOOK V.,To lead the Trojans in the stubborn fight;
3661,BOOK V.,I hearken’d not—’twere better if I had—
3662,BOOK V.,"Yet fear’d I lest my horses, wont to feed"
3663,BOOK V.,"In plenty unstinted, by the soldiers’ wants"
3664,BOOK V.,Might of their custom’d forage be depriv’d;
3665,BOOK V.,"I left them there, and hither came on foot,"
3666,BOOK V.,"And trusting to my bow: vain trust, it seems;"
3667,BOOK V.,"Two chiefs already have I struck, the sons"
3668,BOOK V.,Of Tydeus and of Atreus; with true aim
3669,BOOK V.,"Drawn blood from both, yet but increas’d their rage."
3670,BOOK V.,Sad was the hour when down from where it hung
3671,BOOK V.,"I took my bow, and hasting to the aid"
3672,BOOK V.,"Of godlike Hector, hither led my troops;"
3673,BOOK V.,"But should I e’er return, and see again"
3674,BOOK V.,"My native land, my wife, my lofty hall,"
3675,BOOK V.,"Then may a stranger’s sword cut off my head,"
3676,BOOK V.,"If with these hands I shatter not, and burn,"
3677,BOOK V.,The bow that thus hath fail’d me at my need.”
3678,BOOK V.,
3679,BOOK V.,"Him answer’d thus Æneas, chief of Troy:"
3680,BOOK V.,“Speak thou not thus; our fortunes shall not change
3681,BOOK V.,"Till thou and I, with chariot and with horse,"
3682,BOOK V.,"This chief encounter, and his prowess prove;"
3683,BOOK V.,"Then mount my car, and see how swift my steeds."
3684,BOOK V.,"Hither and thither, in pursuit or flight,"
3685,BOOK V.,"From those of Tros descended, scour the plain."
3686,BOOK V.,"So if the victory to Diomed,"
3687,BOOK V.,"The son of Tydeus, should by Jove be giv’n,"
3688,BOOK V.,We yet may safely reach the walls of Troy.
3689,BOOK V.,"Take thou the whip and reins, while I descend"
3690,BOOK V.,"To fight on foot; or thou the chief engage,"
3691,BOOK V.,And leave to me the conduct of the car.”
3692,BOOK V.,
3693,BOOK V.,Whom answer’d thus Lycaon’s noble son:
3694,BOOK V.,"“Æneas, of thy horses and thy car"
3695,BOOK V.,"Take thou the charge; beneath th’ accustomed hand,"
3696,BOOK V.,"With more assurance would they draw the car,"
3697,BOOK V.,If we from Tydeus’ son be forced to fly;
3698,BOOK V.,"Nor, struck with panic, and thy voice unheard,"
3699,BOOK V.,Refuse to bear us from the battle-field;
3700,BOOK V.,"So should ourselves be slain, and Tydeus’ son"
3701,BOOK V.,In triumph drive thy horses to the ships.
3702,BOOK V.,"But thou thy horses and thy chariot guide,"
3703,BOOK V.,While I his onset with my lance receive.”
3704,BOOK V.,
3705,BOOK V.,"Thus saying, on the car they mounted both,"
3706,BOOK V.,And tow’rd Tydides urg’d their eager steeds.
3707,BOOK V.,"Them Sthenelus beheld, the noble son"
3708,BOOK V.,"Of Capaneus, and to Tydides cried:"
3709,BOOK V.,"“Oh son of Tydeus, dearest to my soul,"
3710,BOOK V.,"Two men I see, of might invincible,"
3711,BOOK V.,"Impatient to engage thee; Pandarus,"
3712,BOOK V.,"Well skill’d in archery, Lycaon’s son;"
3713,BOOK V.,"With him, Æneas, great Anchises’ son,"
3714,BOOK V.,Who from immortal Venus boasts his birth.
3715,BOOK V.,"Then let us timely to the car retreat,"
3716,BOOK V.,"Lest, moving thus amid the foremost ranks,"
3717,BOOK V.,Thy daring pay the forfeit of thy life.”
3718,BOOK V.,
3719,BOOK V.,To whom brave Diomed with stern regard:
3720,BOOK V.,“Talk not to me of flight! I heed thee not!
3721,BOOK V.,It is not in my nature so to fight
3722,BOOK V.,With skulking artifice and faint retreat;
3723,BOOK V.,My strength is yet unbroken; I should shame
3724,BOOK V.,To mount the car; but forward will I go
3725,BOOK V.,To meet these chiefs’ encounter; for my soul
3726,BOOK V.,Pallas forbids the touch of fear to know.
3727,BOOK V.,Nor shall their horses’ speed procure for both
3728,BOOK V.,"A safe return, though one escape my arm."
3729,BOOK V.,"This too I say, and bear my words in mind;"
3730,BOOK V.,By Pallas’ counsel if my hap should be
3731,BOOK V.,"To slay them both, leave thou my horses here,"
3732,BOOK V.,"The reins attaching to the chariot-rail,"
3733,BOOK V.,"And seize, and from the Trojans to the ships"
3734,BOOK V.,Drive off the horses in Æneas’ car;
3735,BOOK V.,"From those descended, which all-seeing Jove"
3736,BOOK V.,"On Tros, for Ganymede his son, bestow’d:"
3737,BOOK V.,With these may none beneath the sun compare.
3738,BOOK V.,"Anchises, King of men, the breed obtain’d"
3739,BOOK V.,"By cunning, to the horses sending mares"
3740,BOOK V.,Without the knowledge of Laomedon.
3741,BOOK V.,Six colts were thus engender’d: four of these
3742,BOOK V.,In his own stalls he rear’d; the other two
3743,BOOK V.,"Gave to Æneas, fear-inspiring chief:"
3744,BOOK V.,"These could we win, our praise were great indeed.”"
3745,BOOK V.,
3746,BOOK V.,"Such converse while they held, the twain approach’d,"
3747,BOOK V.,"Their horses urg’d to speed; then thus began,"
3748,BOOK V.,"To Diomed, Lycaon’s noble son:"
3749,BOOK V.,
3750,BOOK V.,"“Great son of Tydeus, warrior brave and skill’d,"
3751,BOOK V.,"My shaft, it seems, has fail’d to reach thy life;"
3752,BOOK V.,Try we then now what hap attends my spear.”
3753,BOOK V.,"He said; and, poising, hurl’d his pond’rous spear,"
3754,BOOK V.,And struck Tydides’ shield; right through the shield
3755,BOOK V.,"Drove the keen weapon, and the breastplate reach’d."
3756,BOOK V.,Then shouted loud Lycaon’s noble son:
3757,BOOK V.,"“Thou hast it through the flank, nor canst thou long"
3758,BOOK V.,Survive the blow; great glory now is mine.”
3759,BOOK V.,
3760,BOOK V.,"To whom, unmov’d, the valiant Diomed:"
3761,BOOK V.,"“Thine aim hath failed, I am not touch’d; and now"
3762,BOOK V.,I deem we part not hence till one of ye
3763,BOOK V.,Glut with his blood th’ insatiate Lord of War.”
3764,BOOK V.,
3765,BOOK V.,"He said: the spear, by Pallas guided, struck"
3766,BOOK V.,"Beside the nostril, underneath the eye;"
3767,BOOK V.,"Crash’d thro’ the teeth, and cutting thro’ the tongue"
3768,BOOK V.,Beneath the angle of the jaw came forth:
3769,BOOK V.,Down from the car he fell; and loudly rang
3770,BOOK V.,His glitt’ring arms: aside the startled steeds
3771,BOOK V.,Sprang devious: from his limbs the spirit fled.
3772,BOOK V.,"Down leap’d Æneas, spear and shield in hand,"
3773,BOOK V.,Against the Greeks to guard the valiant dead;
3774,BOOK V.,"And like a lion, fearless in his strength,"
3775,BOOK V.,"Around the corpse he stalk’d, this way and that,"
3776,BOOK V.,"His spear and buckler round before him held,"
3777,BOOK V.,"To all who dar’d approach him threat’ning death,"
3778,BOOK V.,With fearful shouts; a rocky fragment then
3779,BOOK V.,"Tydides lifted up, a mighty mass,"
3780,BOOK V.,"Which scarce two men could raise, as men are now:"
3781,BOOK V.,"But he, unaided, lifted it with ease."
3782,BOOK V.,"With this he smote Æneas near the groin,"
3783,BOOK V.,"Where the thigh-bone, inserted in the hip,"
3784,BOOK V.,Turns in the socket-joint; the rugged mass
3785,BOOK V.,"The socket crush’d, and both the tendons broke,"
3786,BOOK V.,"And tore away the flesh: down on his knees,"
3787,BOOK V.,"Yet resting on his hand, the hero fell;"
3788,BOOK V.,And o’er his eyes the shades of darkness spread.
3789,BOOK V.,"Then had Æneas, King of men, been slain,"
3790,BOOK V.,"Had not his mother, Venus, child of Jove,"
3791,BOOK V.,"Who to Anchises, where he fed his flocks,"
3792,BOOK V.,"The hero bore, his peril quickly seen:"
3793,BOOK V.,"Around her son she threw her snowy arms,"
3794,BOOK V.,"And with a veil, thick-folded, wrapt him round,"
3795,BOOK V.,"From hostile spears to guard him, lest some Greek"
3796,BOOK V.,"Should pierce his breast, and rob him of his life."
3797,BOOK V.,
3798,BOOK V.,She from the battle thus her son removed;
3799,BOOK V.,Nor did the son of Capaneus neglect
3800,BOOK V.,The strict injunction by Tydides giv’n;
3801,BOOK V.,"His reins attaching to the chariot-rail,"
3802,BOOK V.,"Far from the battle-din he check’d, and left,"
3803,BOOK V.,"His own fleet steeds; then rushing forward, seiz’d,"
3804,BOOK V.,"And from the Trojans tow’rd the camp drove off,"
3805,BOOK V.,The sleek-skinn’d horses of Æneas’ car.
3806,BOOK V.,"These to Deipylus, his chosen friend,"
3807,BOOK V.,"He gave, of all his comrades best esteem’d,"
3808,BOOK V.,"Of soundest judgment, tow’rd the ships to drive."
3809,BOOK V.,"Then, his own car remounting, seiz’d the reins,"
3810,BOOK V.,"And urg’d with eager haste his fiery steeds,"
3811,BOOK V.,"Seeking Tydides; he, meanwhile, press’d on"
3812,BOOK V.,In keen pursuit of Venus; her he knew
3813,BOOK V.,"A weak, unwarlike Goddess, not of those"
3814,BOOK V.,"That like Bellona fierce, or Pallas, range"
3815,BOOK V.,Exulting through the blood-stain’d fields of war.
3816,BOOK V.,
3817,BOOK V.,"Her, searching thro’ the crowd, at length he found,"
3818,BOOK V.,"And springing forward, with his pointed spear"
3819,BOOK V.,A wound inflicted on her tender hand.
3820,BOOK V.,"Piercing th’ ambrosial veil, the Graces’ work,"
3821,BOOK V.,The sharp spear graz’d her palm below the wrist.
3822,BOOK V.,"Forth from the wound th’ immortal current flow’d,"
3823,BOOK V.,"Pure ichor, life-stream of the blessed Gods;"
3824,BOOK V.,"They eat no bread, they drink no ruddy wine,"
3825,BOOK V.,And bloodless thence and deathless they become.
3826,BOOK V.,"The Goddess shriek’d aloud, and dropp’d her son;"
3827,BOOK V.,But in his arms Apollo bore him off
3828,BOOK V.,"In a thick cloud envelop’d, lest some Greek"
3829,BOOK V.,"Might pierce his breast, and rob him of his life."
3830,BOOK V.,"Loud shouted brave Tydides, as she fled:"
3831,BOOK V.,"“Daughter of Jove, from battle-fields retire;"
3832,BOOK V.,Enough for thee weak woman to delude;
3833,BOOK V.,"If war thou seek’st, the lesson thou shalt learn"
3834,BOOK V.,Shall cause thee shudder but to hear it nam’d.”
3835,BOOK V.,"Thus he; but ill at ease, and sorely pain’d,"
3836,BOOK V.,"The Goddess fled: her, Iris, swift as wind,"
3837,BOOK V.,"Caught up, and from the tumult bore away,"
3838,BOOK V.,"Weeping with pain, her fair skin soil’d with blood."
3839,BOOK V.,
3840,BOOK V.,Mars on the left hand of the battle-field
3841,BOOK V.,"She found, his spear reclining by his side,"
3842,BOOK V.,"And, veil’d in cloud, his car and flying steeds."
3843,BOOK V.,"Kneeling, her brother she besought to lend"
3844,BOOK V.,"The flying steeds, with golden frontlets crown’d:"
3845,BOOK V.,"“Dear brother, aid me hence, and lend thy car"
3846,BOOK V.,"To bear me to Olympus, seat of Gods;"
3847,BOOK V.,Great is the pain I suffer from a wound
3848,BOOK V.,"Receiv’d from Diomed, a mortal man,"
3849,BOOK V.,Who now would dare with Jove himself to fight.”
3850,BOOK V.,
3851,BOOK V.,"He lent the steeds, with golden frontlets crown’d;"
3852,BOOK V.,In deep distress she mounted on the car:
3853,BOOK V.,"Beside her Iris stood, and took the reins,"
3854,BOOK V.,"And urg’d the coursers; nothing loth they flew,"
3855,BOOK V.,"And soon to high Olympus, seat of Gods,"
3856,BOOK V.,"They came: swift Iris there the coursers stay’d,"
3857,BOOK V.,"Loos’d from the chariot, and before them plac’d"
3858,BOOK V.,"Ambrosial forage: on her mother’s lap,"
3859,BOOK V.,"Dione, Venus fell; she in her arms"
3860,BOOK V.,"Embrac’d, and sooth’d her with her hand, and said:"
3861,BOOK V.,"“Which of the heav’nly pow’rs hath wrong’d thee thus,"
3862,BOOK V.,"My child, as guilty of some open shame?”"
3863,BOOK V.,
3864,BOOK V.,Whom answer’d thus the laughter-loving Queen;
3865,BOOK V.,"“The haughty son of Tydeus, Diomed,"
3866,BOOK V.,"Hath wounded me, because my dearest son,"
3867,BOOK V.,"Æneas, from the field I bore away."
3868,BOOK V.,"No more ’twixt Greeks and Trojans is the fight,"
3869,BOOK V.,But with the Gods themselves the Greeks contend.”
3870,BOOK V.,"To whom Dione, heav’nly Goddess, thus:"
3871,BOOK V.,"“Have patience, dearest child; though much enforc’d,"
3872,BOOK V.,"Restrain thine anger: we, in Heav’n who dwell,"
3873,BOOK V.,Have much to bear from mortals; and ourselves
3874,BOOK V.,Too oft upon each other suff’rings lay.
3875,BOOK V.,"Mars had his suff’rings; by Aloeus’ sons,"
3876,BOOK V.,"Otus and Ephialtes, strongly bound,"
3877,BOOK V.,He thirteen months in brazen fetters lay:
3878,BOOK V.,"And there had pin’d away the God of War,"
3879,BOOK V.,"Insatiate Mars, had not their step-mother,"
3880,BOOK V.,"The beauteous Eriboea, sought the aid"
3881,BOOK V.,"Of Hermes; he by stealth releas’d the God,"
3882,BOOK V.,Sore worn and wasted by his galling chains.
3883,BOOK V.,"Juno too suffer’d, when Amphitryon’s son"
3884,BOOK V.,Through her right breast a three-barb’d arrow sent:
3885,BOOK V.,"Dire, and unheard of, were the pangs she bore."
3886,BOOK V.,"Great Pluto’s self the stinging arrow felt,"
3887,BOOK V.,When that same son of aegis-bearing Jove
3888,BOOK V.,"Assail’d him in the very gates of hell,"
3889,BOOK V.,And wrought him keenest anguish; pierc’d with pain
3890,BOOK V.,"To high Olympus, to the courts of Jove,"
3891,BOOK V.,"Groaning, he came; the bitter shaft remain’d"
3892,BOOK V.,"Deep in his shoulder fix’d, and griev’d his soul."
3893,BOOK V.,But soon with soothing ointments Paeon’s hand
3894,BOOK V.,(For death on him was powerless) heal’d the wound.
3895,BOOK V.,"Accurs’d was he, of daring over-bold,"
3896,BOOK V.,"Reckless of evil deeds, who with his bow"
3897,BOOK V.,"Assail’d the Gods, who on Olympus dwell."
3898,BOOK V.,"The blue-ey’d Pallas, well I know, has urg’d"
3899,BOOK V.,Tydides to assail thee; fool and blind!
3900,BOOK V.,Unknowing he how short his term of life
3901,BOOK V.,Who fights against the Gods! for him no child
3902,BOOK V.,"Upon his knees shall lisp a father’s name,"
3903,BOOK V.,Safe from the war and battle-field return’d.
3904,BOOK V.,"Brave as he is, let Diomed beware"
3905,BOOK V.,He meet not some more dangerous foe than thee.
3906,BOOK V.,"Then fair Ægiale, Adrastus’ child,"
3907,BOOK V.,"The noble wife of valiant Diomed,"
3908,BOOK V.,"Shall long, with lamentations loud, disturb"
3909,BOOK V.,"The slumbers of her house, and vainly mourn"
3910,BOOK V.,"Her youthful Lord, the bravest of the Greeks.”"
3911,BOOK V.,She said; and wip’d the ichor from the wound;
3912,BOOK V.,"The hand was heal’d, the grievous pains allay’d."
3913,BOOK V.,"But Juno and Minerva, looking on,"
3914,BOOK V.,With words of bitter mock’ry Saturn’s son
3915,BOOK V.,Provok’d: and thus the blue-ey’d Goddess spoke:
3916,BOOK V.,“O Father! may I speak without offence?
3917,BOOK V.,"Venus, it seems, has sought to lead astray"
3918,BOOK V.,"Some Grecian woman, and persuade to join"
3919,BOOK V.,"Those Trojans, whom she holds in high esteem;"
3920,BOOK V.,"And, as her hand the gentle dame caress’d,"
3921,BOOK V.,A golden clasp has scratched her slender arm.”
3922,BOOK V.,
3923,BOOK V.,Thus she: and smil’d the Sire of Gods and men;
3924,BOOK V.,"He call’d the golden Venus to his side,"
3925,BOOK V.,"And, “Not to thee, my child,” he said, “belong"
3926,BOOK V.,The deeds of war; do thou bestow thy care
3927,BOOK V.,"On deeds of love, and tender marriage ties;"
3928,BOOK V.,But leave to Mars and Pallas feats of arms.”
3929,BOOK V.,
3930,BOOK V.,"Such converse while they held, brave Diomed"
3931,BOOK V.,Again assail’d Æneas; well he knew
3932,BOOK V.,Apollo’s guardian hand around him thrown;
3933,BOOK V.,"Yet by the God undaunted, on he press’d"
3934,BOOK V.,"To slay Æneas, and his arms obtain."
3935,BOOK V.,"Thrice was his onset made, with murd’rous aim;"
3936,BOOK V.,And thrice Apollo struck his glitt’ring shield;
3937,BOOK V.,"But when, with godlike force, he sought to make"
3938,BOOK V.,"His fourth attempt, the Far-destroyer spoke"
3939,BOOK V.,"In terms of awful menace: “Be advis’d,"
3940,BOOK V.,"Tydides, and retire; nor as a God"
3941,BOOK V.,Esteem thyself; since not alike the race
3942,BOOK V.,Of Gods immortal and of earth-born men.”
3943,BOOK V.,
3944,BOOK V.,He said; and Diomed a little space
3945,BOOK V.,Before the Far-destroyer’s wrath retir’d:
3946,BOOK V.,Apollo then Æneas bore away
3947,BOOK V.,"Far from the tumult; and in Pergamus,"
3948,BOOK V.,"Where stood his sacred shrine, bestow’d him safe."
3949,BOOK V.,"Latona there, and Dian, Archer-Queen,"
3950,BOOK V.,"In the great temple’s innermost recess,"
3951,BOOK V.,"Gave to his wounds their care, and sooth’d his pride."
3952,BOOK V.,Meanwhile Apollo of the silver bow
3953,BOOK V.,"A phantom form prepar’d, the counterpart"
3954,BOOK V.,"Of great Æneas, and alike in arms:"
3955,BOOK V.,"Around the form, of Trojans and of Greeks,"
3956,BOOK V.,Loud was the din of battle; fierce the strokes
3957,BOOK V.,"That fell on rounded shield of tough bull’s-hide,"
3958,BOOK V.,"And lighter targe, before each warrior’s breast."
3959,BOOK V.,Then thus Apollo to the God of War:
3960,BOOK V.,"“Mars! Mars! thou bane of mortals, blood-stain’d Lord,"
3961,BOOK V.,"Razer of cities, wer’t not well thyself"
3962,BOOK V.,"To interpose, and from the battle-field"
3963,BOOK V.,"Withdraw this chief, Tydides? such his pride,"
3964,BOOK V.,He now would dare with Jove himself to fight.
3965,BOOK V.,"Venus, of late, he wounded in the wrist;"
3966,BOOK V.,"And, like a God, but now confronted me.”"
3967,BOOK V.,"He said, and sat on Ilium’s topmost height:"
3968,BOOK V.,"While Mars, in likeness of the Thracian chief,"
3969,BOOK V.,"Swift Acamas, amid the Trojan ranks"
3970,BOOK V.,"Mov’d to and fro, and urg’d them to the fight."
3971,BOOK V.,To Priam’s Heav’n-descended sons he call’d;
3972,BOOK V.,"“Ye sons of Priam, Heav’n-descended King,"
3973,BOOK V.,How long will ye behold your people slain?
3974,BOOK V.,Till to your very doors the war be brought?
3975,BOOK V.,"Æneas, noble-soul’d Anchises’ son,"
3976,BOOK V.,"In like esteem with Hector held, is down;"
3977,BOOK V.,On to his aid! our gallant comrade save!”
3978,BOOK V.,
3979,BOOK V.,He said; his words fresh courage gave to all:
3980,BOOK V.,"Then thus Sarpedon, in reproachful tone,"
3981,BOOK V.,"Address’d the godlike Hector; “Where is now,"
3982,BOOK V.,"Hector, the spirit that heretofore was thine?"
3983,BOOK V.,’Twas once thy boast that ev’n without allies
3984,BOOK V.,"Thyself, thy brethren, and thy house, alone"
3985,BOOK V.,The city could defend: for all of these
3986,BOOK V.,"I look in vain, and see not one; they all,"
3987,BOOK V.,"As curs around a lion, cow’r and crouch:"
3988,BOOK V.,"We, strangers and allies, maintain the fight."
3989,BOOK V.,"I to your aid, from lands afar remote,"
3990,BOOK V.,"From Lycia came, by Xanthus’ eddying stream;"
3991,BOOK V.,"There left a cherish’d wife, and infant son,"
3992,BOOK V.,"And rich possessions, which might envy move;"
3993,BOOK V.,Yet I my troops encourage; and myself
3994,BOOK V.,"Have play’d my part, though nought have I to lose,"
3995,BOOK V.,Nought that the Greeks could drive or bear away;
3996,BOOK V.,But thou stand’st idly by; nor bidd’st the rest
3997,BOOK V.,"Maintain their ground, and guard their wives and homes."
3998,BOOK V.,"Beware lest ye, as in the meshes caught"
3999,BOOK V.,"Of some wide-sweeping net, become the prey"
4000,BOOK V.,"And booty of your foes, who soon shall lay"
4001,BOOK V.,Your prosp’rous city level with the dust.
4002,BOOK V.,"By day and night should this thy thoughts engage,"
4003,BOOK V.,"With constant pray’r to all thy brave allies,"
4004,BOOK V.,"Firmly to stand, and wipe this shame away.”"
4005,BOOK V.,
4006,BOOK V.,He said; and Hector felt the biting speech;
4007,BOOK V.,"Down from his car he leap’d; and through the ranks,"
4008,BOOK V.,"Two jav’lins brandishing, he pass’d, to arms"
4009,BOOK V.,"Exciting all, and rais’d his battle-cry."
4010,BOOK V.,The tide was turn’d; again they fac’d the Greeks:
4011,BOOK V.,"In serried ranks the Greeks, undaunted, stood."
4012,BOOK V.,"As when the wind from off a threshing-floor,"
4013,BOOK V.,"Where men are winnowing, blows the chaff away;"
4014,BOOK V.,When yellow Ceres with the breeze divides
4015,BOOK V.,"The corn and chaff, which lies in whit’ning heaps;"
4016,BOOK V.,"So thick the Greeks were whiten’d o’er with dust,"
4017,BOOK V.,Which to the brazen vault of Heav’n arose
4018,BOOK V.,"Beneath the horses’ feet, that with the crowd"
4019,BOOK V.,"Were mingled, by their drivers turn’d to flight."
4020,BOOK V.,"Unwearied still, they bore the brunt; but Mars"
4021,BOOK V.,"The Trojans succouring, the battle-field"
4022,BOOK V.,"Veil’d in thick clouds, from ev’ry quarter brought."
4023,BOOK V.,Thus he of Phoebus of the golden sword
4024,BOOK V.,"Obey’d th’ injunction, bidding him arouse"
4025,BOOK V.,"The courage of the Trojans, when he saw"
4026,BOOK V.,Pallas approaching to support the Greeks.
4027,BOOK V.,
4028,BOOK V.,Then from the wealthy shrine Apollo’s self
4029,BOOK V.,"Æneas brought, and vigour fresh infus’d:"
4030,BOOK V.,Amid his comrades once again he stood;
4031,BOOK V.,"They joy’d to see him yet alive, and sound,"
4032,BOOK V.,And full of vigour; yet no question ask’d:
4033,BOOK V.,"No time for question then, amid the toils"
4034,BOOK V.,"Impos’d by Phoebus of the silver bow,"
4035,BOOK V.,"And blood-stain’d Mars, and Discord unappeas’d."
4036,BOOK V.,
4037,BOOK V.,"Meanwhile Ulysses, and th’ Ajaces both,"
4038,BOOK V.,"And Diomed, with courage for the fight"
4039,BOOK V.,The Grecian force inspir’d; they undismay’d
4040,BOOK V.,Shrank not before the Trojans’ rush and charge;
4041,BOOK V.,"In masses firm they stood, as when the clouds"
4042,BOOK V.,Are gather’d round the misty mountain top
4043,BOOK V.,"By Saturn’s son, in breathless calm, while sleep"
4044,BOOK V.,"The force of Boreas and the stormy winds,"
4045,BOOK V.,That with their breath the shadowy clouds disperse;
4046,BOOK V.,"So stood the Greeks, nor shunn’d the Trojans’ charge."
4047,BOOK V.,"Through all the army Agamemnon pass’d,"
4048,BOOK V.,"And cried, “Brave comrades, quit ye now like men;"
4049,BOOK V.,"Bear a stout heart; and in the stubborn fight,"
4050,BOOK V.,Let each to other mutual succour give;
4051,BOOK V.,By mutual succour more are sav’d than fall;
4052,BOOK V.,In timid flight nor fame nor safety lies.”
4053,BOOK V.,
4054,BOOK V.,"Thus he: and straight his jav’lin threw, and struck"
4055,BOOK V.,"A man of mark, Æneas’ faithful friend,"
4056,BOOK V.,"Deicoon, the son of Pergasus,"
4057,BOOK V.,"By Troy, as ever foremost in the field,"
4058,BOOK V.,In equal honour held with Priam’s sons.
4059,BOOK V.,His shield the monarch Agamemnon struck;
4060,BOOK V.,The shield’s defence was vain; the spear pass’d through
4061,BOOK V.,"Beneath the belt, and in his groin was lodg’d;"
4062,BOOK V.,"Thund’ring he fell, and loud his armour rang."
4063,BOOK V.,
4064,BOOK V.,"On th’ other side, Æneas slew two chiefs,"
4065,BOOK V.,"The bravest of the Greeks, Orsilochus"
4066,BOOK V.,"And Crethon, sons of Diocles, who dwelt"
4067,BOOK V.,"In thriving Phera; rich in substance he,"
4068,BOOK V.,And from the mighty River Alpheus trac’d
4069,BOOK V.,"His high descent, who through the Pylian land"
4070,BOOK V.,His copious waters pours; to him was born
4071,BOOK V.,"Orsilochus, of num’rous tribes the chief;"
4072,BOOK V.,To him succeeded valiant Diocles;
4073,BOOK V.,"To whom were born twin sons, Orsilochus"
4074,BOOK V.,"And Crethon, skill’d in ev’ry point of war."
4075,BOOK V.,"They, in the vigour of their youth, to Troy"
4076,BOOK V.,"Had sail’d amid the dark-ribb’d ships of Greece,"
4077,BOOK V.,Of Atreus’ sons the quarrel to uphold;
4078,BOOK V.,But o’er them both the shades of death were spread.
4079,BOOK V.,"As two young lions, by their tawny dam"
4080,BOOK V.,"Nurs’d in the mountain forest’s deep recess,"
4081,BOOK V.,"On flocks and herds their youthful fury pour,"
4082,BOOK V.,"With havoc to the sheepfolds, till themselves"
4083,BOOK V.,"Succumb, o’ermaster’d by the hand of man:"
4084,BOOK V.,"So fell these two beneath Æneas’ hand,"
4085,BOOK V.,And like two lofty pines in death they lay.
4086,BOOK V.,
4087,BOOK V.,The warlike Menelaus saw their fall
4088,BOOK V.,With pitying eye; and through the foremost ranks
4089,BOOK V.,"With brandish’d spear advanc’d, by Mars impell’d,"
4090,BOOK V.,Who hop’d his death by great Æneas’ hand.
4091,BOOK V.,"Him Nestor’s son, Antilochus, beheld,"
4092,BOOK V.,And hasten’d to his aid; for much he fear’d
4093,BOOK V.,"Lest ill befall the monarch, and his death"
4094,BOOK V.,Deprive them of their warlike labours’ fruit.
4095,BOOK V.,"They two, with force combined of hand and spear,"
4096,BOOK V.,Press’d onward to the fight; Antilochus
4097,BOOK V.,His station keeping close beside the King.
4098,BOOK V.,"Before the two combined, Æneas fear’d,"
4099,BOOK V.,"Bold warrior as he was, to hold his ground."
4100,BOOK V.,"The slain they drew within the Grecian lines,"
4101,BOOK V.,"Placed in their comrades’ hands, and turning back"
4102,BOOK V.,Amid the foremost mingled in the fray.
4103,BOOK V.,"Then, brave as Mars, Pylaemenes they slew,"
4104,BOOK V.,The buckler’d Paphlagonians’ warlike chief;
4105,BOOK V.,"Him Menelaus, hand to hand engag’d,"
4106,BOOK V.,Pierc’d with a spear-thrust through the collar-bone;
4107,BOOK V.,"While, with a pond’rous stone, Antilochus"
4108,BOOK V.,"Full on the elbow smote Atymnius’ son,"
4109,BOOK V.,"Mydon, his charioteer, in act to turn"
4110,BOOK V.,His fiery steeds to flight; down from his hands
4111,BOOK V.,Fell to the ground the iv’ry-mounted reins.
4112,BOOK V.,"On rush’d Antilochus, and with his sword"
4113,BOOK V.,"Across the temples smote him; gasping, he"
4114,BOOK V.,Upon his neck and shoulders from the car
4115,BOOK V.,Pitch’d headlong; and (for there the sand was deep)
4116,BOOK V.,"Awhile stood balanc’d, till the horses’ feet"
4117,BOOK V.,"Dash’d him upon the ground; Antilochus,"
4118,BOOK V.,"The horses seizing, drove them to the ships."
4119,BOOK V.,
4120,BOOK V.,"Hector beheld athwart the ranks, and rush’d,"
4121,BOOK V.,"Loud shouting, to th’ encounter; at his back"
4122,BOOK V.,"Follow’d the thronging bands of Troy, by Mars"
4123,BOOK V.,And fierce Bellona led; she by the hand
4124,BOOK V.,Wild Uproar held; while Mars a giant spear
4125,BOOK V.,"Brandish’d aloft: and stalking now before,"
4126,BOOK V.,"Now following after Hector, urg’d them on."
4127,BOOK V.,Quail’d at the sight the valiant Diomed:
4128,BOOK V.,"As when a man, long journeying o’er the plain,"
4129,BOOK V.,"All unprepar’d, stands sudden on the brink"
4130,BOOK V.,"Of a swift stream, down rushing to the sea,"
4131,BOOK V.,"Boiling with foam, and back recoils; so then"
4132,BOOK V.,"Recoil’d Tydides, and address’d the crowd:"
4133,BOOK V.,"“O friends, we marvel at the might display’d"
4134,BOOK V.,"By Hector, spearman skill’d and warrior bold;"
4135,BOOK V.,"But still some guardian God his steps attends,"
4136,BOOK V.,"And shields from danger; now beside him stands,"
4137,BOOK V.,"In likeness of a mortal, Mars himself."
4138,BOOK V.,"Then turning still your faces to your foes,"
4139,BOOK V.,"Retire, nor venture with the Gods to fight.”"
4140,BOOK V.,
4141,BOOK V.,"He said; the Trojans now were close at hand,"
4142,BOOK V.,"And, mounted both upon a single car,"
4143,BOOK V.,"Two chiefs, Menesthes and Anchialus,"
4144,BOOK V.,"Well skill’d in war, by Hector’s hand were slain."
4145,BOOK V.,
4146,BOOK V.,With pitying eyes great Ajax Telamon
4147,BOOK V.,"Beheld their fall; advancing close, he threw"
4148,BOOK V.,His glitt’ring spear; the son of Selagus
4149,BOOK V.,"It struck, Amphius, who in Paesus dwelt,"
4150,BOOK V.,In land and substance rich; by evil fate
4151,BOOK V.,"Impell’d, to Priam’s house he brought his aid."
4152,BOOK V.,"Below the belt the spear of Ajax struck,"
4153,BOOK V.,And in his groin the point was buried deep;
4154,BOOK V.,Thund’ring he fell; then forward Ajax sprang
4155,BOOK V.,To seize the spoils of war; but fast and fierce
4156,BOOK V.,"The Trojans show’r’d their weapons bright and keen,"
4157,BOOK V.,And many a lance the mighty shield receiv’d.
4158,BOOK V.,"Ajax, his foot firm planted on the slain,"
4159,BOOK V.,Withdrew the brazen spear; yet could not strip
4160,BOOK V.,"His armour off, so galling flew the shafts;"
4161,BOOK V.,"And much he fear’d his foes might hem him in,"
4162,BOOK V.,"Who closely press’d upon him, many and brave;"
4163,BOOK V.,"And, valiant as he was, and tall, and strong,"
4164,BOOK V.,Still drove him backward; he perforce retired.
4165,BOOK V.,
4166,BOOK V.,Thus labour’d they amid the stubborn fight.
4167,BOOK V.,"Then evil fate induc’d Tlepolemus,"
4168,BOOK V.,"Valiant and strong, the son of Hercules,"
4169,BOOK V.,Heav’n-born Sarpedon to confront in fight.
4170,BOOK V.,"When near they came, of cloud-compelling Jove"
4171,BOOK V.,"Grandson and son, Tlepolemus began:"
4172,BOOK V.,"“Sarpedon, Lycian chief, what brings thee here,"
4173,BOOK V.,"Trembling and crouching, all unskill’d in war?"
4174,BOOK V.,Falsely they speak who fable thee the son
4175,BOOK V.,Of aegis-bearing Jove; so far art thou
4176,BOOK V.,Beneath their mark who claim’d in elder days
4177,BOOK V.,"That royal lineage: such my father was,"
4178,BOOK V.,"Of courage resolute, of lion heart."
4179,BOOK V.,"With but six ships, and with a scanty band,"
4180,BOOK V.,The horses by Laomedon withheld
4181,BOOK V.,"Avenging, he o’erthrew this city, Troy,"
4182,BOOK V.,And made her streets a desert; but thy soul
4183,BOOK V.,"Is poor, thy troops are wasting fast away;"
4184,BOOK V.,Nor deem I that the Trojans will in thee
4185,BOOK V.,(Ev’n were thy valour more) and Lycia’s aid
4186,BOOK V.,"Their safeguard find; but vanquish’d by my hand,"
4187,BOOK V.,This day the gates of Hades thou shalt pass.”
4188,BOOK V.,
4189,BOOK V.,"To whom the Lycian chief, Sarpedon, thus:"
4190,BOOK V.,"“Tlepolemus, the sacred walls of Troy"
4191,BOOK V.,"Thy sire o’erthrew, by folly of one man,"
4192,BOOK V.,"Laomedon, who with injurious words"
4193,BOOK V.,His noble service recompens’d; nor gave
4194,BOOK V.,"The promis’d steeds, for which he came from far."
4195,BOOK V.,"For thee, I deem thou now shalt meet thy doom"
4196,BOOK V.,"Here, at my hand; on thee my spear shall win"
4197,BOOK V.,"Renown for me, thy soul to Hades send.”"
4198,BOOK V.,
4199,BOOK V.,"Thus as Sarpedon spoke, Tlepolemus"
4200,BOOK V.,Uprais’d his ashen spear; from both their hands
4201,BOOK V.,The pond’rous weapons simultaneous flew.
4202,BOOK V.,Full in the throat Tlepolemus receiv’d
4203,BOOK V.,"Sarpedon’s spear; right through the neck it pass’d,"
4204,BOOK V.,And o’er his eyes the shades of death were spread.
4205,BOOK V.,On th’ other side his spear Sarpedon struck
4206,BOOK V.,On the left thigh; the eager weapon pass’d
4207,BOOK V.,"Right through the flesh, and in the bone was fix’d;"
4208,BOOK V.,The stroke of death his father turn’d aside.
4209,BOOK V.,"Sarpedon from the field his comrades bore,"
4210,BOOK V.,"Weigh’d down and tortured by the trailing spear,"
4211,BOOK V.,"For, in their haste to bear him to his car,"
4212,BOOK V.,Not one bethought him from his thigh to draw
4213,BOOK V.,The weapon forth; so sorely were they press’d.
4214,BOOK V.,
4215,BOOK V.,The Greeks too from the battle-field convey’d
4216,BOOK V.,"The slain Tlepolemus; Ulysses saw,"
4217,BOOK V.,"Patient of spirit, but deeply mov’d at heart;"
4218,BOOK V.,"And with conflicting thoughts his breast was torn,"
4219,BOOK V.,"If first he should pursue the Thund’rer’s son,"
4220,BOOK V.,Or deal destruction on the Lycian host.
4221,BOOK V.,But fate had not decreed the valiant son
4222,BOOK V.,Of Jove to fall beneath Ulysses’ hand;
4223,BOOK V.,So on the Lycians Pallas turn’d his wrath.
4224,BOOK V.,"Alastor then, and Coeranus he slew,"
4225,BOOK V.,"Chromius, Alcander, Halius, Prytanis,"
4226,BOOK V.,Noemon; nor had ended then the list
4227,BOOK V.,Of Lycian warriors by Ulysses slain;
4228,BOOK V.,But Hector of the glancing helm beheld;
4229,BOOK V.,"Through the front ranks he rush’d, with burnish’d crest"
4230,BOOK V.,"Resplendent, flashing terror on the Greeks;"
4231,BOOK V.,"With joy Sarpedon saw his near approach,"
4232,BOOK V.,And with imploring tones address’d him thus:
4233,BOOK V.,
4234,BOOK V.,"“Hector, thou son of Priam, leave me not"
4235,BOOK V.,"A victim to the Greeks, but lend thine aid:"
4236,BOOK V.,Then in your city let me end my days.
4237,BOOK V.,For not to me is giv’n again to see
4238,BOOK V.,"My native land; or, safe returning home,"
4239,BOOK V.,To glad my sorrowing wife and infant child.”
4240,BOOK V.,
4241,BOOK V.,"Thus he; but Hector, answ’ring not a word,"
4242,BOOK V.,"Pass’d on in silence, hasting to pursue"
4243,BOOK V.,"The Greeks, and pour destruction on their host."
4244,BOOK V.,
4245,BOOK V.,Beneath the oak of aegis-bearing Jove
4246,BOOK V.,"His faithful comrades laid Sarpedon down,"
4247,BOOK V.,"And from his thigh the valiant Pelagon,"
4248,BOOK V.,"His lov’d companion, drew the ashen spear."
4249,BOOK V.,"He swoon’d, and giddy mists o’erspread his eyes:"
4250,BOOK V.,"But soon reviv’d, as on his forehead blew,"
4251,BOOK V.,"While yet he gasp’d for breath, the cooling breeze."
4252,BOOK V.,
4253,BOOK V.,By Mars and Hector of the brazen helm
4254,BOOK V.,"The Greeks hard-press’d, yet fled not to their ships,"
4255,BOOK V.,Nor yet sustain’d the fight; but back retir’d
4256,BOOK V.,Soon as they learned the presence of the God.
4257,BOOK V.,"Say then who first, who last, the prowess felt"
4258,BOOK V.,"Of Hector, Priam’s son, and mail-clad Mars?"
4259,BOOK V.,"The godlike Teuthras first, Orestes next,"
4260,BOOK V.,"Bold charioteer; th’ Ætolian spearman skill’d,"
4261,BOOK V.,"Trechus, Œnomaus, and Helenus,"
4262,BOOK V.,"The son of Œnops; and Oresbius, girt"
4263,BOOK V.,"With sparkling girdle; he in Hyla dwelt,"
4264,BOOK V.,"The careful Lord of boundless wealth, beside"
4265,BOOK V.,Cephisus’ marshy banks; Bœotia’s chiefs
4266,BOOK V.,"Around him dwelt, on fat and fertile soil."
4267,BOOK V.,"Juno, the white-arm’d Queen, who saw these two"
4268,BOOK V.,"The Greeks destroying in the stubborn fight,"
4269,BOOK V.,To Pallas thus her winged words address’d:
4270,BOOK V.,"“O Heav’n! brave child of aegis-bearing Jove,"
4271,BOOK V.,Vain was our word to Menelaus giv’n.
4272,BOOK V.,"That he the well-built walls of Troy should raze,"
4273,BOOK V.,"And safe return, if unrestrain’d we leave"
4274,BOOK V.,Ferocious Mars to urge his mad career.
4275,BOOK V.,Come then; let us too mingle in the fray.”
4276,BOOK V.,
4277,BOOK V.,"She said: and Pallas, blue-ey’d Maid, complied."
4278,BOOK V.,"Offspring of Saturn, Juno, heav’nly Queen,"
4279,BOOK V.,"Herself th’ immortal steeds caparison’d,"
4280,BOOK V.,Adorn’d with golden frontlets: to the car
4281,BOOK V.,"Hebe the circling wheels of brass attach’d,"
4282,BOOK V.,"Eight-spok’d, that on an iron axle turn’d;"
4283,BOOK V.,"The felloes were of gold, and fitted round"
4284,BOOK V.,"With brazen tires, a marvel to behold;"
4285,BOOK V.,"The naves were silver, rounded every way:"
4286,BOOK V.,The chariot-board on gold and silver bands
4287,BOOK V.,"Was hung, and round it ran a double rail:"
4288,BOOK V.,The pole was all of silver; at the end
4289,BOOK V.,"A golden yoke, with golden yoke-bands fair:"
4290,BOOK V.,"And Juno, all on fire to join the fray,"
4291,BOOK V.,Beneath the yoke the flying coursers led.
4292,BOOK V.,
4293,BOOK V.,"Pallas, the child of aegis-bearing Jove,"
4294,BOOK V.,"Within her father’s threshold dropp’d her veil,"
4295,BOOK V.,"Of airy texture, work of her own hands;"
4296,BOOK V.,"The cuirass donn’d of cloud-compelling Jove,"
4297,BOOK V.,And stood accoutred for the bloody fray.
4298,BOOK V.,Her tassell’d aegis round her shoulders next
4299,BOOK V.,"She threw, with Terror circled all around;"
4300,BOOK V.,"And on its face were figur’d deeds of arms,"
4301,BOOK V.,"And Strife, and Courage high, and panic Rout;"
4302,BOOK V.,"There too a Gorgon’s head, of monstrous size,"
4303,BOOK V.,"Frown’d terrible, portent of angry Jove:"
4304,BOOK V.,"And on her head a golden helm she plac’d,"
4305,BOOK V.,"Four-crested, double-peak’d, whose ample verge"
4306,BOOK V.,A hundred cities’ champions might suffice:
4307,BOOK V.,Her fiery car she mounted: in her hand
4308,BOOK V.,"A spear she bore, long, weighty, tough; wherewith"
4309,BOOK V.,The mighty daughter of a mighty sire
4310,BOOK V.,Sweeps down the ranks of those her hate pursues.
4311,BOOK V.,
4312,BOOK V.,Then Juno sharply touch’d the flying steeds:
4313,BOOK V.,"Forthwith spontaneous opening, grated harsh"
4314,BOOK V.,"The heavenly portals, guarded by the Hours,"
4315,BOOK V.,Who Heav’n and high Olympus have in charge
4316,BOOK V.,"To roll aside, or draw the veil of cloud."
4317,BOOK V.,Through these th’ excited horses held their way.
4318,BOOK V.,"They found the son of Saturn, from the Gods"
4319,BOOK V.,"Sitting apart, upon the highest crest"
4320,BOOK V.,"Of many-ridg’d Olympus; there arriv’d,"
4321,BOOK V.,"The white-arm’d Goddess Juno stay’d her steeds,"
4322,BOOK V.,And thus address’d the Sov’reign Lord of Heav’n:
4323,BOOK V.,
4324,BOOK V.,“O Father Jove! canst thou behold unmov’d
4325,BOOK V.,"The violence of Mars? how many Greeks,"
4326,BOOK V.,"Reckless and uncontroll’d, he hath destroy’d;"
4327,BOOK V.,To me a source of bitter grief; meanwhile
4328,BOOK V.,Venus and Phoebus of the silver bow
4329,BOOK V.,"Look on, well pleas’d, who sent this madman forth,"
4330,BOOK V.,To whom both law and justice are unknown.
4331,BOOK V.,"Say, Father Jove, shall I thine anger move,"
4332,BOOK V.,If with disgrace I drive him from the field?”
4333,BOOK V.,
4334,BOOK V.,To whom the Cloud-compeller thus replied:
4335,BOOK V.,"“Go, send against him Pallas; she, I know,"
4336,BOOK V.,Hath oft inflicted on him grievous pain.”.
4337,BOOK V.,
4338,BOOK V.,He said: the white-arm’d Queen with joy obey’d;
4339,BOOK V.,"She urg’d her horses; nothing loth, they flew"
4340,BOOK V.,"Midway between the earth, and starry Heav’n:"
4341,BOOK V.,"Far as his sight extends, who from on high"
4342,BOOK V.,"Looks from his watch-tow’r o’er the dark-blue sea,"
4343,BOOK V.,So far at once the neighing horses bound.
4344,BOOK V.,"But when to Troy they came, beside the streams"
4345,BOOK V.,"Where Simois’ and Scamander’s waters meet,"
4346,BOOK V.,"The white-arm’d Goddess stay’d her flying steeds,"
4347,BOOK V.,"Loos’d from the car, and veil’d in densest cloud."
4348,BOOK V.,"For them, at bidding of the river-God,"
4349,BOOK V.,"Ambrosial forage grew: the Goddesses,"
4350,BOOK V.,"Swift as the wild wood-pigeon’s rapid flight,"
4351,BOOK V.,Sped to the battle-field to aid the Greeks.
4352,BOOK V.,"But when they reach’d the thickest of the fray,"
4353,BOOK V.,Where throng’d around the might of Diomed
4354,BOOK V.,"The bravest and the best, as lions fierce,"
4355,BOOK V.,"Or forest-boars, the mightiest of their kind,"
4356,BOOK V.,"There stood the white-arm’d Queen, and call’d aloud,"
4357,BOOK V.,"In form of Stentor, of the brazen voice,"
4358,BOOK V.,Whose shout was as the shout of fifty men:
4359,BOOK V.,
4360,BOOK V.,"“Shame on ye, Greeks, base cowards! brave alone"
4361,BOOK V.,In outward semblance; while Achilles yet
4362,BOOK V.,"Went forth to battle, from the Dardan gates"
4363,BOOK V.,"The Trojans never ventur’d to advance,"
4364,BOOK V.,So dreaded they his pond’rous spear; but now
4365,BOOK V.,"Far from the walls, beside your ships, they fight.”"
4366,BOOK V.,
4367,BOOK V.,She said: her words their drooping courage rous’d.
4368,BOOK V.,Meanwhile the blue-ey’d Pallas went in haste
4369,BOOK V.,In search of Tydeus’ son; beside his car
4370,BOOK V.,"She found the King, in act to cool the wound"
4371,BOOK V.,Inflicted by the shaft of Pandarus:
4372,BOOK V.,Beneath his shield’s broad belt the clogging sweat
4373,BOOK V.,"Oppress’d him, and his arm was faint with toil;"
4374,BOOK V.,"The belt was lifted up, and from the wound"
4375,BOOK V.,He wip’d the clotted blood: beside the car
4376,BOOK V.,"The Goddess stood, and touch’d the yoke, and said:"
4377,BOOK V.,
4378,BOOK V.,“Little like Tydeus’ self is Tydeus’ son:
4379,BOOK V.,"Low was his stature, but his spirit was high:"
4380,BOOK V.,And ev’n when I from combat rashly wag’d
4381,BOOK V.,"Would fain have kept him back, what time in Thebes"
4382,BOOK V.,"He found himself, an envoy and alone,"
4383,BOOK V.,"Without support, among the Thebans all,"
4384,BOOK V.,I counsell’d him in peace to share the feast:
4385,BOOK V.,"But by his own impetuous courage led,"
4386,BOOK V.,He challenged all the Thebans to contend
4387,BOOK V.,"With him in wrestling, and o’erthrew them all"
4388,BOOK V.,With ease; so mighty was the aid I gave.
4389,BOOK V.,"Thee now I stand beside, and guard from harm,"
4390,BOOK V.,And bid thee boldly with the Trojans fight.
4391,BOOK V.,"But, if the labours of the battle-field"
4392,BOOK V.,"O’ertask thy limbs, or heartless fear restrain,"
4393,BOOK V.,No issue thou of valiant Tydeus’ loins.”
4394,BOOK V.,
4395,BOOK V.,Whom answer’d thus the valiant Diomed:
4396,BOOK V.,"“I know thee, Goddess, who thou art; the child"
4397,BOOK V.,Of aegis-bearing Jove: to thee my mind
4398,BOOK V.,"I freely speak, nor aught will I conceal."
4399,BOOK V.,"Nor heartless fear, nor hesitating doubt,"
4400,BOOK V.,"Restrain me; but I bear thy words in mind,"
4401,BOOK V.,With other of th’ Immortals not to fight:
4402,BOOK V.,"But should Jove’s daughter, Venus, dare the fray,"
4403,BOOK V.,At her I need not shun to throw my spear.
4404,BOOK V.,"Therefore I thus withdrew, and others too"
4405,BOOK V.,"Exhorted to retire, since Mars himself"
4406,BOOK V.,I saw careering o’er the battle-field.”
4407,BOOK V.,
4408,BOOK V.,"To whom the blue-ey’d Goddess, Pallas, thus:"
4409,BOOK V.,"“Thou son of Tydeus, dearest to my soul,"
4410,BOOK V.,"Fear now no more with Mars himself to fight,"
4411,BOOK V.,Nor other God; such aid will I bestow.
4412,BOOK V.,Come then; at him the first direct thy car;
4413,BOOK V.,Encounter with him hand to hand; nor fear
4414,BOOK V.,"To strike this madman, this incarnate curse,"
4415,BOOK V.,This shameless renegade; who late agreed
4416,BOOK V.,"With Juno and with me to combat Troy,"
4417,BOOK V.,"And aid the Grecian cause; who now appears,"
4418,BOOK V.,"The Greeks deserting, in the Trojan ranks.”"
4419,BOOK V.,
4420,BOOK V.,"Thus Pallas spoke, and stretching forth her hand"
4421,BOOK V.,Backward his comrade Sthenelus she drew
4422,BOOK V.,From off the chariot; down in haste he sprang.
4423,BOOK V.,His place beside the valiant Diomed
4424,BOOK V.,The eager Goddess took; beneath the weight
4425,BOOK V.,Loud groan’d the oaken axle; for the car
4426,BOOK V.,A mighty Goddess and a Hero bore.
4427,BOOK V.,"Then Pallas took the whip and reins, and urg’d"
4428,BOOK V.,Direct at Mars the fiery coursers’ speed.
4429,BOOK V.,
4430,BOOK V.,"The bravest of th’ Ætolians, Periphas,"
4431,BOOK V.,"Ochesius’ stalwart son, he just had slain,"
4432,BOOK V.,And stood in act to strip him of his arms.
4433,BOOK V.,"The helmet then of Darkness Pallas donn’d,"
4434,BOOK V.,To hide her presence from the sight of Mars:
4435,BOOK V.,But when the blood-stain’d God of War beheld
4436,BOOK V.,"Advancing tow’rd him godlike Diomed,"
4437,BOOK V.,"The corpse of stalwart Periphas he left,"
4438,BOOK V.,"There where he fell, to lie; while he himself"
4439,BOOK V.,Of valiant Diomed th’ encounter met.
4440,BOOK V.,"When near they came, first Mars his pond’rous spear"
4441,BOOK V.,"Advanc’d beyond the yoke and horses’ reins,"
4442,BOOK V.,With murd’rous aim; but Pallas from the car
4443,BOOK V.,"Turn’d it aside, and foil’d the vain attempt."
4444,BOOK V.,
4445,BOOK V.,Then Diomed thrust forward in his turn
4446,BOOK V.,"His pond’rous spear; low on the flank of Mars,"
4447,BOOK V.,"Guided by Pallas, with successful aim,"
4448,BOOK V.,"Just where the belt was girt, the weapon struck:"
4449,BOOK V.,"It pierc’d the flesh, and straight was back withdrawn:"
4450,BOOK V.,"Then Mars cried out aloud, with such a shout"
4451,BOOK V.,As if nine thousand or ten thousand men
4452,BOOK V.,Should simultaneous raise their battle-cry:
4453,BOOK V.,"Trojans and Greeks alike in terror heard,"
4454,BOOK V.,Trembling; so fearful was the cry of Mars.
4455,BOOK V.,"As black with clouds appears the darken’d air,"
4456,BOOK V.,"When after heat the blust’ring winds arise,"
4457,BOOK V.,"So Mars to valiant Diomed appear’d,"
4458,BOOK V.,As in thick clouds he took his heav’nward flight.
4459,BOOK V.,"With speed he came to great Olympus’ heights,"
4460,BOOK V.,Th’ abode of Gods; and sitting by the throne
4461,BOOK V.,"Of Saturn’s son, with anguish torn, he show’d"
4462,BOOK V.,"Th’ immortal stream that trickled from the wound,"
4463,BOOK V.,And thus to Jove his piteous words address’d:
4464,BOOK V.,
4465,BOOK V.,"“O Father Jove, canst thou behold unmov’d"
4466,BOOK V.,These acts of violence? the greatest ills
4467,BOOK V.,"We Gods endure, we each to other owe"
4468,BOOK V.,Who still in human quarrels interpose.
4469,BOOK V.,Of thee we all complain; thy senseless child
4470,BOOK V.,Is ever on some evil deed intent.
4471,BOOK V.,"The other Gods, who on Olympus dwell,"
4472,BOOK V.,Are all to thee obedient and submiss;
4473,BOOK V.,"But thy pernicious daughter, nor by word"
4474,BOOK V.,Nor deed dost thou restrain; who now excites
4475,BOOK V.,"Th’ o’erbearing son of Tydeus, Diomed,"
4476,BOOK V.,Upon th’ immortal Gods to vent his rage.
4477,BOOK V.,"Venus of late he wounded in the wrist,"
4478,BOOK V.,"And, as a God, but now encounter’d me:"
4479,BOOK V.,Barely I ’scap’d by swiftness of my feet;
4480,BOOK V.,"Else, ’mid a ghastly heap of corpses slain,"
4481,BOOK V.,"In anguish had I lain; and, if alive,"
4482,BOOK V.,Yet liv’d disabl’d by his weapon’s stroke.”
4483,BOOK V.,
4484,BOOK V.,"Whom answer’d thus the Cloud-compeller, Jove,"
4485,BOOK V.,"With look indignant: “Come no more to me,"
4486,BOOK V.,"Thou wav’ring turncoat, with thy whining pray’rs:"
4487,BOOK V.,Of all the Gods who on Olympus dwell
4488,BOOK V.,I hate thee most; for thou delight’st in nought
4489,BOOK V.,But strife and war; thou hast inherited
4490,BOOK V.,"Thy mother, Juno’s, proud, unbending mood,"
4491,BOOK V.,"Whom I can scarce control; and thou, methinks,"
4492,BOOK V.,To her suggestions ow’st thy present plight.
4493,BOOK V.,"Yet since thou art my offspring, and to me"
4494,BOOK V.,"Thy mother bore thee, I must not permit"
4495,BOOK V.,That thou should’st long be doom’d to suffer pain;
4496,BOOK V.,"But had thy birth been other than it is,"
4497,BOOK V.,For thy misdoings thou hadst long ere now
4498,BOOK V.,Been banish’d from the Gods’ companionship.”
4499,BOOK V.,
4500,BOOK V.,He said: and straight to Paeon gave command
4501,BOOK V.,To heal the wound; with soothing anodynes
4502,BOOK V.,He heal’d it quickly; soon as liquid milk
4503,BOOK V.,"Is curdled by the fig-tree’s juice, and turns"
4504,BOOK V.,"In whirling flakes, so soon was heal’d the wound."
4505,BOOK V.,"By Hebe bath’d, and rob’d afresh, he sat"
4506,BOOK V.,"In health and strength restor’d, by Saturn’s son."
4507,BOOK V.,
4508,BOOK V.,"Mars thus arrested in his murd’rous course,"
4509,BOOK V.,Together to th’ abode of Jove return’d
4510,BOOK V.,The Queen of Argos and the blue-ey’d Maid.

4534,BOOK VI.,
4535,BOOK VI.,"The Gods had left the field, and o’er the plain"
4536,BOOK VI.,"Hither and thither surg’d the tide of war,"
4537,BOOK VI.,"As couch’d th’ opposing chiefs their brass-tipp’d spears,"
4538,BOOK VI.,Midway ’twixt Simois’ and Scamander’s streams.
4539,BOOK VI.,
4540,BOOK VI.,First through the Trojan phalanx broke his way
4541,BOOK VI.,"The son of Telamon, the prop of Greece,"
4542,BOOK VI.,The mighty Ajax; on his friends the light
4543,BOOK VI.,"Of triumph shedding, as Eusorus’ son"
4544,BOOK VI.,"He smote, the noblest of the Thracian bands,"
4545,BOOK VI.,"Valiant and strong, the gallant Acamas."
4546,BOOK VI.,"Full in the front, beneath the plumed helm,"
4547,BOOK VI.,"The sharp spear struck, and crashing thro’ the bone,"
4548,BOOK VI.,The warrior’s eyes were clos’d in endless night.
4549,BOOK VI.,
4550,BOOK VI.,"Next valiant Diomed Axylus slew,"
4551,BOOK VI.,"The son of Teuthranes, who had his home"
4552,BOOK VI.,"In fair Arisba; rich in substance he,"
4553,BOOK VI.,"And lov’d of all; for, dwelling near the road,"
4554,BOOK VI.,He op’d to all his hospitable gate;
4555,BOOK VI.,But none of all he entertain’d was there
4556,BOOK VI.,To ward aside the bitter doom of death:
4557,BOOK VI.,"There fell they both, he and his charioteer,"
4558,BOOK VI.,"Calesius, who athwart the battle-field"
4559,BOOK VI.,His chariot drove; one fate o’ertook them both.
4560,BOOK VI.,
4561,BOOK VI.,Then Dresus and Opheltius of their arms
4562,BOOK VI.,Euryalus despoil’d; his hot pursuit
4563,BOOK VI.,"Æsepus next, and Pedasus assail’d,"
4564,BOOK VI.,"Brothers, whom Abarbarea, Naiad nymph,"
4565,BOOK VI.,"To bold Bucolion bore; Bucolion, son"
4566,BOOK VI.,"Of great Laomedon, his eldest born,"
4567,BOOK VI.,"Though bastard: he upon the mountain side,"
4568,BOOK VI.,"On which his flocks he tended, met the nymph,"
4569,BOOK VI.,And of their secret loves twin sons were born;
4570,BOOK VI.,Whom now at once Euryalus of strength
4571,BOOK VI.,"And life depriv’d, and of their armour stripp’d."
4572,BOOK VI.,
4573,BOOK VI.,"By Polypoetes’ hand, in battle strong,"
4574,BOOK VI.,"Was slain Astyalus; Pidutes fell,"
4575,BOOK VI.,"Chief of Percote, by Ulysses’ spear;"
4576,BOOK VI.,And Teucer godlike Aretaon slew.
4577,BOOK VI.,"Antilochus, the son of Nestor, smote"
4578,BOOK VI.,With gleaming lance Ablerus; Elatus
4579,BOOK VI.,"By Agamemnon, King of men, was slain,"
4580,BOOK VI.,"Who dwelt by Satnois’ widely-flowing stream,"
4581,BOOK VI.,Upon the lofty heights of Pedasus.
4582,BOOK VI.,By Leitus was Phylacus in flight
4583,BOOK VI.,O’erta’en; Eurypylus Melanthius slew.
4584,BOOK VI.,
4585,BOOK VI.,"Then Menelaus, good in battle, took"
4586,BOOK VI.,"Adrastus captive; for his horses, scar’d"
4587,BOOK VI.,"And rushing wildly o’er the plain, amid"
4588,BOOK VI.,"The tangled tamarisk scrub his chariot broke,"
4589,BOOK VI.,Snapping the pole; they with the flying crowd
4590,BOOK VI.,Held city-ward their course; he from the car
4591,BOOK VI.,"Hurl’d headlong, prostrate lay beside the wheel,"
4592,BOOK VI.,"Prone on his face in dust; and at his side,"
4593,BOOK VI.,"Poising his mighty spear, Atrides stood."
4594,BOOK VI.,"Adrastus clasp’d his knees, and suppliant cried,"
4595,BOOK VI.,"“Spare me, great son of Atreus! for my life"
4596,BOOK VI.,Accept a price; my wealthy father’s house
4597,BOOK VI.,"A goodly store contains of brass, and gold,"
4598,BOOK VI.,And well-wrought iron; and of these he fain
4599,BOOK VI.,"Would pay a noble ransom, could he hear"
4600,BOOK VI.,That in the Grecian ships I yet surviv’d.”
4601,BOOK VI.,
4602,BOOK VI.,His words to pity mov’d the victor’s breast;
4603,BOOK VI.,Then had he bade his followers to the ships
4604,BOOK VI.,The captive bear; but running up in haste.
4605,BOOK VI.,Fierce Agamemnon cried in stern rebuke;
4606,BOOK VI.,
4607,BOOK VI.,"“Soft-hearted Menelaus, why of life"
4608,BOOK VI.,So tender? Hath thy house receiv’d indeed
4609,BOOK VI.,Nothing but benefits at Trojan hands?
4610,BOOK VI.,"Of that abhorred race, let not a man"
4611,BOOK VI.,Escape the deadly vengeance of our arms;
4612,BOOK VI.,"No, not the infant in its mother’s womb;"
4613,BOOK VI.,"No, nor the fugitive; but be they all,"
4614,BOOK VI.,"They and their city, utterly destroy’d,"
4615,BOOK VI.,"Uncar’d for, and from mem’ry blotted out.”"
4616,BOOK VI.,
4617,BOOK VI.,"Thus as he spoke, his counsel, fraught with death,"
4618,BOOK VI.,His brother’s purpose chang’d; he with his hand
4619,BOOK VI.,"Adrastus thrust aside, whom with his lance"
4620,BOOK VI.,Fierce Agamemnon through the loins transfix’d;
4621,BOOK VI.,"And, as he roll’d in death, upon his breast"
4622,BOOK VI.,"Planting his foot, the ashen spear withdrew."
4623,BOOK VI.,
4624,BOOK VI.,Then loudly Nestor shouted to the Greeks:
4625,BOOK VI.,"“Friends, Grecian heroes, ministers of Mars!"
4626,BOOK VI.,"Loiter not now behind, to throw yourselves"
4627,BOOK VI.,"Upon the prey, and bear it to the ships;"
4628,BOOK VI.,Let all your aim be now to kill; anon
4629,BOOK VI.,Ye may at leisure spoil your slaughter’d foes.”
4630,BOOK VI.,
4631,BOOK VI.,With words like these he fir’d the blood of all.
4632,BOOK VI.,Now had the Trojans by the warlike Greeks
4633,BOOK VI.,In coward flight within their walls been driv’n;
4634,BOOK VI.,But to Æneas and to Hector thus
4635,BOOK VI.,"The son of Priam, Helenus, the best"
4636,BOOK VI.,"Of all the Trojan seers, address’d his speech:"
4637,BOOK VI.,"“Æneas, and thou Hector, since on you,"
4638,BOOK VI.,"Of all the Trojans and the Lycian hosts,"
4639,BOOK VI.,"Is laid the heaviest burthen, for that ye"
4640,BOOK VI.,"Excel alike in council and in fight,"
4641,BOOK VI.,"Stand here awhile, and moving to and fro"
4642,BOOK VI.,"On ev’ry side, around the gates exhort"
4643,BOOK VI.,"The troops to rally, lest they fall disgrac’d,"
4644,BOOK VI.,"Flying for safety to their women’s arms,"
4645,BOOK VI.,"And foes, exulting, triumph in their shame."
4646,BOOK VI.,"Their courage thus restor’d, worn as we are,"
4647,BOOK VI.,"We with the Greeks will still maintain the fight,"
4648,BOOK VI.,"For so, perforce, we must; but, Hector, thou"
4649,BOOK VI.,"Haste to the city; there our mother find,"
4650,BOOK VI.,Both thine and mine; on Ilium’s topmost height
4651,BOOK VI.,"By all the aged dames accompanied,"
4652,BOOK VI.,Bid her the shrine of blue-ey’d Pallas seek;
4653,BOOK VI.,Unlock the sacred gates; and on the knees
4654,BOOK VI.,Of fair-hair’d Pallas place the fairest robe
4655,BOOK VI.,"In all the house, the amplest, best esteem’d;"
4656,BOOK VI.,And at her altar vow to sacrifice
4657,BOOK VI.,"Twelve yearling kine that never felt the goad,"
4658,BOOK VI.,"So she have pity on the Trojan state,"
4659,BOOK VI.,"Our wives, and helpless babes, and turn away"
4660,BOOK VI.,"The fiery son of Tydeus, spearman fierce,"
4661,BOOK VI.,"The Minister of Terror; bravest he,"
4662,BOOK VI.,"In my esteem, of all the Grecian chiefs:"
4663,BOOK VI.,"For not Achilles’ self, the prince of men,"
4664,BOOK VI.,"Though Goddess-born, such dread inspir’d; so fierce"
4665,BOOK VI.,His rage; and with his prowess none may vie.”
4666,BOOK VI.,
4667,BOOK VI.,"He said, nor uncomplying, Hector heard"
4668,BOOK VI.,His brother’s counsel; from his car he leap’d
4669,BOOK VI.,In arms upon the plain; and brandish’d high
4670,BOOK VI.,"His jav’lins keen, and moving to and fro"
4671,BOOK VI.,"The troops encourag’d, and restor’d the fight."
4672,BOOK VI.,"Rallying they turn’d, and fac’d again the Greeks:"
4673,BOOK VI.,"These ceas’d from slaughter, and in turn gave way,"
4674,BOOK VI.,Deeming that from the starry Heav’n some God
4675,BOOK VI.,Had to the rescue come; so fierce they turn’d.
4676,BOOK VI.,Then to the Trojans Hector call’d aloud:
4677,BOOK VI.,
4678,BOOK VI.,"“Ye valiant Trojans, and renown’d Allies,"
4679,BOOK VI.,"Quit you like men; remember now, brave friends,"
4680,BOOK VI.,Your wonted valour; I to Ilium go
4681,BOOK VI.,To bid our wives and rev’rend Elders raise
4682,BOOK VI.,"To Heav’n their pray’rs, with vows of hecatombs.”"
4683,BOOK VI.,
4684,BOOK VI.,"Thus saying, Hector of the glancing helm"
4685,BOOK VI.,"Turn’d to depart; and as he mov’d along,"
4686,BOOK VI.,"The black bull’s-hide his neck and ancles smote,"
4687,BOOK VI.,The outer circle of his bossy shield.
4688,BOOK VI.,
4689,BOOK VI.,"Then Tydeus’ son, and Glaucus, in the midst,"
4690,BOOK VI.,"Son of Hippolochus, stood forth to fight;"
4691,BOOK VI.,"But when they near were met, to Glaucus first"
4692,BOOK VI.,The valiant Diomed his speech address’d:
4693,BOOK VI.,"“Who art thou, boldest man of mortal birth?"
4694,BOOK VI.,For in the glorious conflict heretofore
4695,BOOK VI.,I ne’er have seen thee; but in daring now
4696,BOOK VI.,"Thou far surpassest all, who hast not fear’d"
4697,BOOK VI.,To face my spear; of most unhappy sires
4698,BOOK VI.,"The children they, who my encounter meet."
4699,BOOK VI.,"But if from Heav’n thou com’st, and art indeed"
4700,BOOK VI.,"A God, I fight not with the heav’nly powers."
4701,BOOK VI.,"Not long did Dryas’ son, Lycurgus brave,"
4702,BOOK VI.,"Survive, who dar’d th’ Immortals to defy:"
4703,BOOK VI.,"He, ’mid their frantic orgies, in the groves"
4704,BOOK VI.,"Of lovely Nyssa, put to shameful rout"
4705,BOOK VI.,"The youthful Bacchus’ nurses; they, in fear,"
4706,BOOK VI.,"Dropp’d each her thyrsus, scatter’d by the hand"
4707,BOOK VI.,"Of fierce Lycurgus, with an ox-goad arm’d."
4708,BOOK VI.,Bacchus himself beneath the ocean wave
4709,BOOK VI.,"In terror plung’d, and, trembling, refuge found"
4710,BOOK VI.,In Thetis’ bosom from a mortal’s threats:
4711,BOOK VI.,"The Gods indignant saw, and Saturn’s son"
4712,BOOK VI.,"Smote him with blindness; nor surviv’d he long,"
4713,BOOK VI.,Hated alike by all th’ immortal Gods.
4714,BOOK VI.,I dare not then the blessed Gods oppose;
4715,BOOK VI.,"But be thou mortal, and the fruits of earth"
4716,BOOK VI.,"Thy food, approach, and quickly meet thy doom.”"
4717,BOOK VI.,
4718,BOOK VI.,To whom the noble Glaucus thus replied:
4719,BOOK VI.,"“Great son of Tydeus, why my race enquire?"
4720,BOOK VI.,The race of man is as the race of leaves:
4721,BOOK VI.,"Of leaves, one generation by the wind"
4722,BOOK VI.,Is scattered on the earth; another soon
4723,BOOK VI.,In spring’s luxuriant verdure bursts to light.
4724,BOOK VI.,"So with our race; these flourish, those decay."
4725,BOOK VI.,But if thou wouldst in truth enquire and learn
4726,BOOK VI.,"The race I spring from, not unknown of men;"
4727,BOOK VI.,"There is a city, in the deep recess"
4728,BOOK VI.,"Of pastoral Argos, Ephyre by name:"
4729,BOOK VI.,"There Sisyphus of old his dwelling had,"
4730,BOOK VI.,"Of mortal men the craftiest; Sisyphus,"
4731,BOOK VI.,The son of Æolus; to him was born
4732,BOOK VI.,Glaucus; and Glaucus in his turn begot
4733,BOOK VI.,"Bellerophon, on whom the Gods bestow’d"
4734,BOOK VI.,The gifts of beauty and of manly grace.
4735,BOOK VI.,"But Proetus sought his death; and, mightier far,"
4736,BOOK VI.,"From all the coasts of Argos drove him forth,"
4737,BOOK VI.,To Proetus subjected by Jove’s decree.
4738,BOOK VI.,"For him the monarch’s wife, Antaea, nurs’d"
4739,BOOK VI.,"A madd’ning passion, and to guilty love"
4740,BOOK VI.,Would fain have tempted him; but fail’d to move
4741,BOOK VI.,The upright soul of chaste Bellerophon.
4742,BOOK VI.,With lying words she then address’d the King:
4743,BOOK VI.,"‘Die, Proetus, thou, or slay Bellerophon,"
4744,BOOK VI.,Who basely sought my honour to assail.’
4745,BOOK VI.,The King with anger listen’d to her words;
4746,BOOK VI.,Slay him he would not; that his soul abhorr’d;
4747,BOOK VI.,"But to the father of his wife, the King"
4748,BOOK VI.,"Of Lycia, sent him forth, with tokens charg’d"
4749,BOOK VI.,"Of dire import, on folded tablets trac’d,"
4750,BOOK VI.,"Pois’ning the monarch’s mind, to work his death."
4751,BOOK VI.,"To Lycia, guarded by the Gods, he went;"
4752,BOOK VI.,"But when he came to Lycia, and the streams"
4753,BOOK VI.,"Of Xanthus, there with hospitable rites"
4754,BOOK VI.,The King of wide-spread Lycia welcom’d him.
4755,BOOK VI.,"Nine days he feasted him, nine oxen slew;"
4756,BOOK VI.,But with the tenth return of rosy morn
4757,BOOK VI.,"He question’d him, and for the tokens ask’d"
4758,BOOK VI.,"He from his son-in-law, from Proetus, bore."
4759,BOOK VI.,"The tokens’ fatal import understood,"
4760,BOOK VI.,He bade him first the dread Chimaera slay;
4761,BOOK VI.,"A monster, sent from Heav’n, not human born,"
4762,BOOK VI.,"With head of lion, and a serpent’s tail,"
4763,BOOK VI.,And body of a goat; and from her mouth
4764,BOOK VI.,There issued flames of fiercely-burning fire:
4765,BOOK VI.,"Yet her, confiding in the Gods, he slew."
4766,BOOK VI.,"Next, with the valiant Solymi he fought,"
4767,BOOK VI.,The fiercest fight that e’er he undertook.
4768,BOOK VI.,"Thirdly, the women-warriors he o’erthrew,"
4769,BOOK VI.,"The Amazons; from whom returning home,"
4770,BOOK VI.,The King another stratagem devis’d;
4771,BOOK VI.,"For, choosing out the best of Lycia’s sons,"
4772,BOOK VI.,"He set an ambush; they return’d not home,"
4773,BOOK VI.,For all by brave Bellerophon were slain.
4774,BOOK VI.,"But, by his valour when the King perceiv’d"
4775,BOOK VI.,"His heav’nly birth, he entertain’d him well;"
4776,BOOK VI.,Gave him his daughter; and with her the half
4777,BOOK VI.,Of all his royal honours he bestow’d:
4778,BOOK VI.,"A portion too the Lycians meted out,"
4779,BOOK VI.,"Fertile in corn and wine, of all the state"
4780,BOOK VI.,"The choicest land, to be his heritage."
4781,BOOK VI.,Three children there to brave Bellerophon
4782,BOOK VI.,"Were born; Isander, and Hippolochus,"
4783,BOOK VI.,"Laodamia last, belov’d of Jove,"
4784,BOOK VI.,The Lord of counsel; and to him she bore
4785,BOOK VI.,Godlike Sarpedon of the brazen helm.
4786,BOOK VI.,Bellerophon at length the wrath incurr’d
4787,BOOK VI.,Of all the Gods; and to th’ Aleian plain
4788,BOOK VI.,Alone he wander’d; there he wore away
4789,BOOK VI.,"His soul, and shunn’d the busy haunts of men."
4790,BOOK VI.,Insatiate Mars his son Isander slew
4791,BOOK VI.,In battle with the valiant Solymi:
4792,BOOK VI.,His daughter perish’d by Diana’s wrath.
4793,BOOK VI.,I from Hippolochus my birth derive:
4794,BOOK VI.,"To Troy he sent me, and enjoin’d me oft"
4795,BOOK VI.,"To aim at highest honours, and surpass"
4796,BOOK VI.,My comrades all; nor on my father’s name
4797,BOOK VI.,"Discredit bring, who held the foremost place"
4798,BOOK VI.,"In Ephyre, and Lycia’s wide domain."
4799,BOOK VI.,"Such is my race, and such the blood I boast.”"
4800,BOOK VI.,
4801,BOOK VI.,He said; and Diomed rejoicing heard:
4802,BOOK VI.,"His spear he planted in the fruitful ground,"
4803,BOOK VI.,And thus with friendly words the chief address’d:
4804,BOOK VI.,
4805,BOOK VI.,“By ancient ties of friendship are we bound;
4806,BOOK VI.,For godlike Œneus in his house receiv’d
4807,BOOK VI.,For twenty days the brave Bellerophon;
4808,BOOK VI.,They many a gift of friendship interchang’d;
4809,BOOK VI.,"A belt, with crimson glowing, Œneus gave;"
4810,BOOK VI.,"Bellerophon a double cup of gold,"
4811,BOOK VI.,Which in my house I left when here I came.
4812,BOOK VI.,Of Tydeus no remembrance I retain;
4813,BOOK VI.,"For yet a child he left me, when he fell"
4814,BOOK VI.,With his Achaians at the gate of Thebes.
4815,BOOK VI.,So I in Argos am thy friendly host;
4816,BOOK VI.,"Thou mine in Lycia, when I thither come:"
4817,BOOK VI.,"Then shun we, e’en amid the thickest fight,"
4818,BOOK VI.,Each other’s lance; enough there are for me
4819,BOOK VI.,"Of Trojans and their brave allies to kill,"
4820,BOOK VI.,"As Heav’n may aid me, and my speed of foot;"
4821,BOOK VI.,"And Greeks enough there are for thee to slay,"
4822,BOOK VI.,If so indeed thou canst; but let us now
4823,BOOK VI.,"Our armour interchange, that these may know"
4824,BOOK VI.,What friendly bonds of old our houses join.”
4825,BOOK VI.,"Thus as they spoke, they quitted each his car;"
4826,BOOK VI.,"Clasp’d hand in hand, and plighted mutual faith."
4827,BOOK VI.,"Then Glaucus of his judgment Jove depriv’d,"
4828,BOOK VI.,"His armour interchanging, gold for brass,"
4829,BOOK VI.,A hundred oxen’s worth for that of nine.
4830,BOOK VI.,
4831,BOOK VI.,"Meanwhile, when Hector reach’d the oak beside"
4832,BOOK VI.,"The Scaean gate, around him throng’d the wives"
4833,BOOK VI.,"Of Troy, and daughters, anxious to enquire"
4834,BOOK VI.,"The fate of children, brothers, husbands, friends;"
4835,BOOK VI.,"He to the Gods exhorted all to pray,"
4836,BOOK VI.,For deep the sorrows that o’er many hung.
4837,BOOK VI.,"But when to Priam’s splendid house he came,"
4838,BOOK VI.,With polish’d corridors adorn’d—within
4839,BOOK VI.,"Were fifty chambers, all of polish’d stone,"
4840,BOOK VI.,Plac’d each by other; there the fifty sons
4841,BOOK VI.,Of Priam with their wedded wives repos’d;
4842,BOOK VI.,"On th’ other side, within the court were built"
4843,BOOK VI.,"Twelve chambers, near the roof, of polish’d stone,"
4844,BOOK VI.,Plac’d each by other; there the sons-in-law
4845,BOOK VI.,Of Priam with their spouses chaste repos’d;
4846,BOOK VI.,"To meet him there his tender mother came,"
4847,BOOK VI.,"And with her led the young Laodice,"
4848,BOOK VI.,Fairest of all her daughters; clasping then
4849,BOOK VI.,"His hands, she thus address’d him: “Why, my son,"
4850,BOOK VI.,"Why com’st thou here, and leav’st the battle-field?"
4851,BOOK VI.,"Are Trojans by those hateful sons of Greece,"
4852,BOOK VI.,"Fighting around the city, sorely press’d?"
4853,BOOK VI.,"And com’st thou, by thy spirit mov’d, to raise,"
4854,BOOK VI.,"On Ilium’s heights, thy hands in pray’r to Jove?"
4855,BOOK VI.,"But tarry till I bring the luscious wine,"
4856,BOOK VI.,"That first to Jove, and to th’ Immortals all,"
4857,BOOK VI.,Thou mayst thine off’ring pour; then with the draught
4858,BOOK VI.,Thyself thou mayst refresh; for great the strength
4859,BOOK VI.,"Which gen’rous wine imparts to men who toil,"
4860,BOOK VI.,"As thou hast toil’d, thy comrades to protect.”"
4861,BOOK VI.,
4862,BOOK VI.,To whom great Hector of the glancing helm:
4863,BOOK VI.,"“No, not for me, mine honour’d mother, pour"
4864,BOOK VI.,"The luscious wine, lest thou unnerve my limbs,"
4865,BOOK VI.,And make me all my wonted prowess lose.
4866,BOOK VI.,The ruddy wine I dare not pour to Jove
4867,BOOK VI.,With hands unwash’d; nor to the cloud-girt son
4868,BOOK VI.,Of Saturn may the voice of pray’r ascend
4869,BOOK VI.,From one with blood bespatter’d and defil’d.
4870,BOOK VI.,"Thou, with the elder women, seek the shrine"
4871,BOOK VI.,Of Pallas; bring your gifts; and on the knees
4872,BOOK VI.,Of fair-hair’d Pallas place the fairest robe
4873,BOOK VI.,"In all the house, the amplest, best esteem’d;"
4874,BOOK VI.,And at her altar vow to sacrifice
4875,BOOK VI.,"Twelve yearling kine, that never felt the goad;"
4876,BOOK VI.,"So she have pity on the Trojan state,"
4877,BOOK VI.,"Our wives, and helpless babes; and turn away"
4878,BOOK VI.,"The fiery son of Tydeus, spearman fierce,"
4879,BOOK VI.,The Minister of Terror; to the shrine
4880,BOOK VI.,"Of Pallas thou; to Paris I, to call"
4881,BOOK VI.,If haply he will hear; would that the earth
4882,BOOK VI.,Would gape and swallow him! for great the curse
4883,BOOK VI.,"That Jove thro’ him hath brought on men of Troy,"
4884,BOOK VI.,"On noble Priam, and on Priam’s sons."
4885,BOOK VI.,"Could I but know that he were in his grave,"
4886,BOOK VI.,Methinks my sorrows I could half forget.”
4887,BOOK VI.,
4888,BOOK VI.,"He said: she, to the house returning, sent"
4889,BOOK VI.,"Th’ attendants through the city, to collect"
4890,BOOK VI.,The train of aged suppliants; she meanwhile
4891,BOOK VI.,"Her fragrant chamber sought, wherein were stor’d"
4892,BOOK VI.,"Rich garments by Sidonian women work’d,"
4893,BOOK VI.,"Whom godlike Paris had from Sidon brought,"
4894,BOOK VI.,"Sailing the broad sea o’er, the selfsame path"
4895,BOOK VI.,By which the high-born Helen he convey’d.
4896,BOOK VI.,"Of these, the richest in embroidery,"
4897,BOOK VI.,"The amplest, and the brightest, as a star"
4898,BOOK VI.,"Refulgent, plac’d with care beneath the rest,"
4899,BOOK VI.,The Queen her off’ring bore to Pallas’ shrine:
4900,BOOK VI.,"She went, and with her many an ancient dame."
4901,BOOK VI.,"But when the shrine they reach’d on Ilium’s height,"
4902,BOOK VI.,"Theano, fair of face, the gates unlock’d,"
4903,BOOK VI.,"Daughter of Cisseus, sage Antenor’s wife,"
4904,BOOK VI.,By Trojans nam’d at Pallas’ shrine to serve.
4905,BOOK VI.,They with deep moans to Pallas rais’d their hands;
4906,BOOK VI.,"But fair Theano took the robe, and plac’d"
4907,BOOK VI.,"On Pallas’ knees, and to the heav’nly Maid,"
4908,BOOK VI.,"Daughter of Jove, she thus address’d her pray’r:"
4909,BOOK VI.,"“Guardian of cities, Pallas, awful Queen,"
4910,BOOK VI.,"Goddess of Goddesses, break thou the spear"
4911,BOOK VI.,Of Tydeus’ son; and grant that he himself
4912,BOOK VI.,Prostrate before the Scaean gates may fall;
4913,BOOK VI.,So at thine altar will we sacrifice
4914,BOOK VI.,"Twelve yearling kine, that never felt the goad,"
4915,BOOK VI.,"If thou have pity on the state of Troy,"
4916,BOOK VI.,"The wives of Trojans, and their helpless babes.”"
4917,BOOK VI.,
4918,BOOK VI.,Thus she; but Pallas answer’d not her pray’r.
4919,BOOK VI.,"While thus they call’d upon the heav’nly Maid,"
4920,BOOK VI.,Hector to Paris’ mansion bent his way;
4921,BOOK VI.,"A noble structure, which himself had built"
4922,BOOK VI.,Aided by all the best artificers
4923,BOOK VI.,Who in the fertile realm of Troy were known;
4924,BOOK VI.,"With chambers, hall, and court, on Ilium’s height,"
4925,BOOK VI.,Near to where Priam’s self and Hector dwelt.
4926,BOOK VI.,"There enter’d Hector, well belov’d of Jove;"
4927,BOOK VI.,"And in his hand his pond’rous spear he bore,"
4928,BOOK VI.,Twelve cubits long; bright flash’d the weapon’s point
4929,BOOK VI.,"Of polish’d brass, with circling hoop of gold."
4930,BOOK VI.,"There in his chamber found he whom he sought,"
4931,BOOK VI.,"About his armour busied, polishing"
4932,BOOK VI.,"His shield, his breastplate, and his bended bow."
4933,BOOK VI.,"While Argive Helen, ’mid her maidens plac’d,"
4934,BOOK VI.,The skilful labours of their hands o’erlook’d.
4935,BOOK VI.,To him thus Hector with reproachful words;
4936,BOOK VI.,“Thou dost not well thine anger to indulge;
4937,BOOK VI.,In battle round the city’s lofty wall
4938,BOOK VI.,The people fast are falling; thou the cause
4939,BOOK VI.,That fiercely thus around the city burns
4940,BOOK VI.,The flame of war and battle; and thyself
4941,BOOK VI.,"Wouldst others blame, who from the fight should shrink."
4942,BOOK VI.,"Up, ere the town be wrapp’d in hostile fires.”"
4943,BOOK VI.,
4944,BOOK VI.,To whom in answer godlike Paris thus:
4945,BOOK VI.,"“Hector, I own not causeless thy rebuke;"
4946,BOOK VI.,Yet will I speak; hear thou and understand;
4947,BOOK VI.,"’Twas less from anger with the Trojan host,"
4948,BOOK VI.,"And fierce resentment, that I here remain’d,"
4949,BOOK VI.,Than that I sought my sorrow to indulge;
4950,BOOK VI.,"Yet hath my wife, e’en now, with soothing words"
4951,BOOK VI.,"Urg’d me to join the battle; so, I own,"
4952,BOOK VI.,’Twere best; and Vict’ry changes oft her side.
4953,BOOK VI.,"Then stay, while I my armour don; or thou"
4954,BOOK VI.,"Go first: I, following, will o’ertake thee soon.”"
4955,BOOK VI.,
4956,BOOK VI.,He said: but Hector of the glancing helm
4957,BOOK VI.,Made answer none; then thus with gentle tones
4958,BOOK VI.,"Helen accosted him: “Dear brother mine,"
4959,BOOK VI.,"(Of me, degraded, sorrow-bringing, vile!)"
4960,BOOK VI.,Oh that the day my mother gave me birth
4961,BOOK VI.,Some storm had on the mountains cast me forth!
4962,BOOK VI.,Or that the many-dashing ocean’s waves
4963,BOOK VI.,"Had swept me off, ere all this woe were wrought!"
4964,BOOK VI.,"Yet if these evils were of Heav’n ordain’d,"
4965,BOOK VI.,Would that a better man had call’d me wife;
4966,BOOK VI.,A sounder judge of honour and disgrace:
4967,BOOK VI.,"For he, thou know’st, no firmness hath of mind,"
4968,BOOK VI.,Nor ever will; a want he well may rue.
4969,BOOK VI.,"But come thou in, and rest thee here awhile,"
4970,BOOK VI.,"Dear brother, on this couch; for travail sore"
4971,BOOK VI.,"Encompasseth thy soul, by me impos’d,"
4972,BOOK VI.,"Degraded as I am, and Paris’ guilt;"
4973,BOOK VI.,"On whom this burthen Heav’n hath laid, that shame"
4974,BOOK VI.,On both our names through years to come shall rest.”
4975,BOOK VI.,
4976,BOOK VI.,To whom great Hector of the glancing helm:
4977,BOOK VI.,"“Though kind thy wish, yet, Helen, ask me not"
4978,BOOK VI.,To sit or rest; I cannot yield to thee:
4979,BOOK VI.,"For to the succour of our friends I haste,"
4980,BOOK VI.,"Who feel my loss, and sorely need my aid."
4981,BOOK VI.,"But thou thy husband rouse, and let him speed,"
4982,BOOK VI.,That he may find me still within the walls.
4983,BOOK VI.,For I too homeward go; to see once more
4984,BOOK VI.,"My household, and my wife, and infant child:"
4985,BOOK VI.,"For whether I may e’er again return,"
4986,BOOK VI.,"I know not, or if Heav’n have so decreed,"
4987,BOOK VI.,That I this day by Grecian hands should fall.”
4988,BOOK VI.,
4989,BOOK VI.,"Thus saying, Hector of the glancing helm"
4990,BOOK VI.,Turn’d to depart; with rapid step he reach’d
4991,BOOK VI.,"His own well-furnished house, but found not there"
4992,BOOK VI.,"His white-arm’d spouse, the fair Andromache."
4993,BOOK VI.,She with her infant child and maid the while
4994,BOOK VI.,"Was standing, bath’d in tears, in bitter grief,"
4995,BOOK VI.,On Ilium’s topmost tower: but when her Lord
4996,BOOK VI.,"Found not within the house his peerless wife,"
4997,BOOK VI.,"Upon the threshold pausing, thus he spoke:"
4998,BOOK VI.,"“Tell me, my maidens, tell me true, which way"
4999,BOOK VI.,"Your mistress went, the fair Andromache;"
5000,BOOK VI.,"Or to my sisters, or my brothers’ wives?"
5001,BOOK VI.,Or to the temple where the fair-hair’d dames
5002,BOOK VI.,Of Troy invoke Minerva’s awful name?”
5003,BOOK VI.,
5004,BOOK VI.,To whom the matron of his house replied:
5005,BOOK VI.,"“Hector, if truly we must answer thee,"
5006,BOOK VI.,"Not to thy sisters, nor thy brothers’ wives,"
5007,BOOK VI.,Nor to the temple where the fair-hair’d dames
5008,BOOK VI.,"Of Troy invoke Minerva’s awful name,"
5009,BOOK VI.,But to the height of Ilium’s topmost tow’r
5010,BOOK VI.,Andromache is gone; since tidings came
5011,BOOK VI.,"The Trojan force was overmatch’d, and great"
5012,BOOK VI.,"The Grecian strength; whereat, like one distract,"
5013,BOOK VI.,"She hurried to the walls, and with her took,"
5014,BOOK VI.,"Borne in the nurse’s arms, her infant child.”"
5015,BOOK VI.,
5016,BOOK VI.,So spoke the ancient dame; and Hector straight
5017,BOOK VI.,Through the wide streets his rapid steps retrac’d.
5018,BOOK VI.,But when at last the mighty city’s length
5019,BOOK VI.,"Was travers’d, and the Scaean gates were reach’d,"
5020,BOOK VI.,"Whence was the outlet to the plain, in haste"
5021,BOOK VI.,"Running to meet him came his priceless wife,"
5022,BOOK VI.,"Eetion’s daughter, fair Andromache;"
5023,BOOK VI.,"Eetion, who from Thebes Cilicia sway’d,"
5024,BOOK VI.,"Thebes, at the foot of Placos’ wooded heights."
5025,BOOK VI.,His child to Hector of the brazen helm
5026,BOOK VI.,Was giv’n in marriage: she it was who now
5027,BOOK VI.,"Met him, and by her side the nurse, who bore,"
5028,BOOK VI.,"Clasp’d to her breast, his all unconscious child,"
5029,BOOK VI.,"Hector’s lov’d infant, fair as morning star;"
5030,BOOK VI.,"Whom Hector call’d Scamandrius, but the rest"
5031,BOOK VI.,"Astyanax, in honour of his sire,"
5032,BOOK VI.,"The matchless chief, the only prop of Troy."
5033,BOOK VI.,Silent he smil’d as on his boy he gaz’d:
5034,BOOK VI.,"But at his side Andromache, in tears,"
5035,BOOK VI.,"Hung on his arm, and thus the chief address’d:"
5036,BOOK VI.,
5037,BOOK VI.,"“Dear Lord, thy dauntless spirit will work thy doom:"
5038,BOOK VI.,"Nor hast thou pity on this thy helpless child,"
5039,BOOK VI.,"Or me forlorn, to be thy widow soon:"
5040,BOOK VI.,For thee will all the Greeks with force combin’d
5041,BOOK VI.,"Assail and slay: for me, ’twere better far,"
5042,BOOK VI.,"Of thee bereft, to lie beneath the sod;"
5043,BOOK VI.,"Nor comfort shall be mine, if thou be lost,"
5044,BOOK VI.,"But endless grief; to me nor sire is left,"
5045,BOOK VI.,Nor honour’d mother; fell Achilles’ hand
5046,BOOK VI.,"My sire Eetion slew, what time his arms"
5047,BOOK VI.,"The populous city of Cilicia raz’d,"
5048,BOOK VI.,"The lofty-gated Thebes; he slew indeed,"
5049,BOOK VI.,But stripp’d him not; he reverenc’d the dead;
5050,BOOK VI.,"And o’er his body, with his armour burnt,"
5051,BOOK VI.,"A mound erected; and the mountain nymphs,"
5052,BOOK VI.,"The progeny of aegis-bearing Jove,"
5053,BOOK VI.,Planted around his tomb a grove of elms.
5054,BOOK VI.,There were sev’n brethren in my father’s house;
5055,BOOK VI.,"All in one day they fell, amid their herds"
5056,BOOK VI.,"And fleecy flocks, by fierce Achilles’ hand."
5057,BOOK VI.,"My mother, Queen of Placos’ wooded height,"
5058,BOOK VI.,"Brought with the captives here, he soon releas’d"
5059,BOOK VI.,For costly ransom; but by Dian’s shafts
5060,BOOK VI.,"She, in her father’s house, was stricken down."
5061,BOOK VI.,"But, Hector, thou to me art all in one,"
5062,BOOK VI.,"Sire, mother, brethren! thou, my wedded love!"
5063,BOOK VI.,"Then pitying us, within the tow’r remain,"
5064,BOOK VI.,"Nor make thy child an orphan, and thy wife"
5065,BOOK VI.,A hapless widow; by the fig-tree here
5066,BOOK VI.,"Array thy troops; for here the city wall,"
5067,BOOK VI.,"Easiest of access, most invites assault."
5068,BOOK VI.,"Thrice have their boldest chiefs this point assail’d,"
5069,BOOK VI.,"The two Ajaces, brave Idomeneus,"
5070,BOOK VI.,"Th’ Atridae both, and Tydeus’ warlike son,"
5071,BOOK VI.,"Or by the prompting of some Heav’n-taught seer,"
5072,BOOK VI.,Or by their own advent’rous courage led.”
5073,BOOK VI.,
5074,BOOK VI.,To whom great Hector of the glancing helm;
5075,BOOK VI.,"“Think not, dear wife, that by such thoughts as these"
5076,BOOK VI.,My heart has ne’er been wrung; but I should blush
5077,BOOK VI.,"To face the men and long-rob’d dames of Troy,"
5078,BOOK VI.,"If, like a coward, I could shun the fight."
5079,BOOK VI.,Nor could my soul the lessons of my youth
5080,BOOK VI.,"So far forget, whose boast it still has been"
5081,BOOK VI.,"In the fore-front of battle to be found,"
5082,BOOK VI.,Charg’d with my father’s glory and mine own.
5083,BOOK VI.,"Yet in my inmost soul too well I know,"
5084,BOOK VI.,"The day must come when this our sacred Troy,"
5085,BOOK VI.,"And Priam’s race, and Priam’s royal self"
5086,BOOK VI.,Shall in one common ruin be o’erthrown.
5087,BOOK VI.,"But not the thoughts of Troy’s impending fate,"
5088,BOOK VI.,"Nor Hecuba’s nor royal Priam’s woes,"
5089,BOOK VI.,"Nor loss of brethren, numerous and brave,"
5090,BOOK VI.,"By hostile hands laid prostrate in the dust,"
5091,BOOK VI.,"So deeply wring my heart as thoughts of thee,"
5092,BOOK VI.,"Thy days of freedom lost, and led away"
5093,BOOK VI.,A weeping captive by some brass-clad Greek;
5094,BOOK VI.,"Haply in Argos, at a mistress’ beck,"
5095,BOOK VI.,"Condemn’d to ply the loom, or water draw"
5096,BOOK VI.,"From Hypereia’s or Messeis’ fount,"
5097,BOOK VI.,"Heart-wrung, by stern necessity constrain’d."
5098,BOOK VI.,"Then they who see thy tears perchance may say,"
5099,BOOK VI.,"‘Lo! this was Hector’s wife, who, when they fought"
5100,BOOK VI.,"On plains of Troy, was Ilium’s bravest chief.’"
5101,BOOK VI.,Thus may they speak; and thus thy grief renew
5102,BOOK VI.,"For loss of him, who might have been thy shield"
5103,BOOK VI.,To rescue thee from slav’ry’s bitter hour.
5104,BOOK VI.,"Oh may I sleep in dust, ere be condemn’d"
5105,BOOK VI.,"To hear thy cries, and see thee dragg’d away!”"
5106,BOOK VI.,
5107,BOOK VI.,"Thus as he spoke, great Hector stretch’d his arms"
5108,BOOK VI.,"To take his child; but back the infant shrank,"
5109,BOOK VI.,"Crying, and sought his nurse’s shelt’ring breast,"
5110,BOOK VI.,"Scar’d by the brazen helm and horse-hair plume,"
5111,BOOK VI.,"That nodded, fearful, on the warrior’s crest."
5112,BOOK VI.,"Laugh’d the fond parents both, and from his brow"
5113,BOOK VI.,"Hector the casque remov’d, and set it down,"
5114,BOOK VI.,"All glitt’ring, on the ground; then kiss’d his child,"
5115,BOOK VI.,And danc’d him in his arms; then thus to Jove
5116,BOOK VI.,And to th’ Immortals all address’d his pray’r:
5117,BOOK VI.,"“Grant, Jove, and all ye Gods, that this my son"
5118,BOOK VI.,"May be, as I, the foremost man of Troy,"
5119,BOOK VI.,"For valour fam’d, his country’s guardian King;"
5120,BOOK VI.,"That men may say, ‘This youth surpasses far"
5121,BOOK VI.,"His father,’ when they see him from the fight,"
5122,BOOK VI.,"From slaughter’d foes, with bloody spoils of war"
5123,BOOK VI.,"Returning, to rejoice his mother’s heart!”"
5124,BOOK VI.,
5125,BOOK VI.,"Thus saying, in his mother’s arms he plac’d"
5126,BOOK VI.,"His child; she to her fragrant bosom clasp’d,"
5127,BOOK VI.,Smiling through tears; with eyes of pitying love
5128,BOOK VI.,"Hector beheld, and press’d her hand, and thus"
5129,BOOK VI.,"Address’d her—“Dearest, wring not thus my heart!"
5130,BOOK VI.,"For till my day of destiny is come,"
5131,BOOK VI.,"No man may take my life; and when it comes,"
5132,BOOK VI.,Nor brave nor coward can escape that day.
5133,BOOK VI.,"But go thou home, and ply thy household cares,"
5134,BOOK VI.,"The loom, and distaff, and appoint thy maids"
5135,BOOK VI.,Their sev’ral tasks; and leave to men of Troy
5136,BOOK VI.,"And, chief of all to me, the toils of war.”"
5137,BOOK VI.,
5138,BOOK VI.,"Great Hector said, and rais’d his plumed helm;"
5139,BOOK VI.,"And homeward, slow, with oft-reverted eyes,"
5140,BOOK VI.,"Shedding hot tears, his sorrowing wife return’d."
5141,BOOK VI.,"Arriv’d at valiant Hector’s well-built house,"
5142,BOOK VI.,Her maidens press’d around her; and in all
5143,BOOK VI.,Arose at once the sympathetic grief.
5144,BOOK VI.,"For Hector, yet alive, his household mourn’d,"
5145,BOOK VI.,"Deeming he never would again return,"
5146,BOOK VI.,"Safe from the fight, by Grecian hands unharm’d."
5147,BOOK VI.,
5148,BOOK VI.,Nor linger’d Paris in his lofty halls;
5149,BOOK VI.,"But donn’d his armour, glitt’ring o’er with brass,"
5150,BOOK VI.,And through the city pass’d with bounding steps.
5151,BOOK VI.,"As some proud steed, at well-fill’d manger fed,"
5152,BOOK VI.,"His halter broken, neighing, scours the plain,"
5153,BOOK VI.,And revels in the widely-flowing stream
5154,BOOK VI.,"To bathe his sides; then tossing high his head,"
5155,BOOK VI.,While o’er his shoulders streams his ample mane.
5156,BOOK VI.,"Light borne on active limbs, in conscious pride."
5157,BOOK VI.,To the wide pastures of the mares he flies;
5158,BOOK VI.,"So Paris, Priam’s son, from Ilium’s height,"
5159,BOOK VI.,"His bright arms flashing like the gorgeous sun,"
5160,BOOK VI.,"Hasten’d, with boastful mien, and rapid step."
5161,BOOK VI.,"Hector he found, as from the spot he turn’d"
5162,BOOK VI.,Where with his wife he late had converse held;
5163,BOOK VI.,Whom thus the godlike Paris first address’d:
5164,BOOK VI.,"“Too long, good brother, art then here detain’d,"
5165,BOOK VI.,"Impatient for the fight, by my delay;"
5166,BOOK VI.,"Nor have I timely, as thou bad’st me, come.”"
5167,BOOK VI.,To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm:
5168,BOOK VI.,"“My gallant brother, none who thinks aright"
5169,BOOK VI.,Can cavil at thy prowess in the field;
5170,BOOK VI.,For thou art very valiant; but thy will
5171,BOOK VI.,"Is weak and sluggish; and it grieves my heart,"
5172,BOOK VI.,"When from the Trojans, who in thy behalf"
5173,BOOK VI.,"Such labours undergo, I hear thy name"
5174,BOOK VI.,Coupled with foul reproach! But go we now!
5175,BOOK VI.,"Henceforth shall all be well, if Jove permit"
5176,BOOK VI.,"That from our shores we drive th’ invading Greeks,"
5177,BOOK VI.,And to the ever-living Gods of Heav’n
5178,BOOK VI.,In peaceful homes our free libations pour.”

5275,BOOK VII.,With thee in single combat to contend;
5276,BOOK VII.,"By revelation from th’ eternal Gods,"
5277,BOOK VII.,I know that here thou shalt not meet thy fate.”
5278,BOOK VII.,
5279,BOOK VII.,"He said, and Hector joy’d to hear his words;"
5280,BOOK VII.,"Forth in the midst he stepp’d, and with his spear"
5281,BOOK VII.,"Grasp’d in the middle, stay’d the Trojan ranks."
5282,BOOK VII.,With one accord they sat; on th’ other side
5283,BOOK VII.,Atrides bade the well-greav’d Greeks sit down;
5284,BOOK VII.,"While, in the likeness of two vultures, sat"
5285,BOOK VII.,"On the tall oak of aegis-bearing Jove,"
5286,BOOK VII.,"Pallas, and Phoebus of the silver bow,"
5287,BOOK VII.,With heroes’ deeds delighted; dense around
5288,BOOK VII.,"Bristled the ranks, with shield, and helm, and spear."
5289,BOOK VII.,"As when the west wind freshly blows, and brings"
5290,BOOK VII.,"A dark’ning ripple o’er the ocean waves,"
5291,BOOK VII.,E’en so appear’d upon the plain the ranks
5292,BOOK VII.,"Of Greeks and Trojans; standing in the midst,"
5293,BOOK VII.,Thus to both armies noble Hector spoke:
5294,BOOK VII.,"“Hear, all ye Trojans, and ye well-greav’d Greeks,"
5295,BOOK VII.,"The words I speak, the promptings of my soul."
5296,BOOK VII.,It hath not pleas’d high-thron’d Saturnian Jove
5297,BOOK VII.,"To ratify our truce, who both afflicts"
5298,BOOK VII.,"With labours hard, till either ye shall take"
5299,BOOK VII.,"Our well-fenc’d city, or yourselves to us"
5300,BOOK VII.,Succumb beside your ocean-going ships.
5301,BOOK VII.,Here have ye all the chiefest men of Greece;
5302,BOOK VII.,"Of all, let him who dares with me to fight,"
5303,BOOK VII.,"Stand forth, and godlike Hector’s might confront."
5304,BOOK VII.,"And this I say, and call to witness Jove,"
5305,BOOK VII.,"If with the sharp-edg’d spear he vanquish me,"
5306,BOOK VII.,"He shall strip off, and to the hollow ships"
5307,BOOK VII.,In triumph bear my armour; but my corpse
5308,BOOK VII.,"Restore, that so the men and wives of Troy"
5309,BOOK VII.,May deck with honours due my funeral pyre.
5310,BOOK VII.,"But, by Apollo’s grace should I prevail,"
5311,BOOK VII.,"I will his arms strip off and bear to Troy,"
5312,BOOK VII.,And in Apollo’s temple hang on high;
5313,BOOK VII.,"But to the ships his corpse I will restore,"
5314,BOOK VII.,That so the long-hair’d Greeks with solemn rites
5315,BOOK VII.,"May bury him, and to his mem’ry raise"
5316,BOOK VII.,By the broad Hellespont a lofty tomb;
5317,BOOK VII.,"And men in days to come shall say, who urge"
5318,BOOK VII.,"Their full-oar’d bark across the dark-blue sea,"
5319,BOOK VII.,"‘Lo there a warrior’s tomb of days gone by,"
5320,BOOK VII.,"A mighty chief, whom glorious Hector slew:’"
5321,BOOK VII.,"Thus shall they say, and thus my fame shall live.”"
5322,BOOK VII.,
5323,BOOK VII.,"Thus Hector spoke; they all in silence heard,"
5324,BOOK VII.,"Sham’d to refuse, but fearful to accept."
5325,BOOK VII.,"At length in anger Menelaus rose,"
5326,BOOK VII.,"Groaning in spirit, and with bitter words"
5327,BOOK VII.,"Reproach’d them: “Shame, ye braggart cowards, shame!"
5328,BOOK VII.,Women of Greece! I cannot call you men!
5329,BOOK VII.,"’Twere foul disgrace indeed, and scorn on scorn,"
5330,BOOK VII.,If Hector’s challenge none of all the Greeks
5331,BOOK VII.,Should dare accept; to dust and water turn
5332,BOOK VII.,"All ye who here inglorious, heartless sit!"
5333,BOOK VII.,"I will myself confront him; for success,"
5334,BOOK VII.,Th’ immortal Gods above the issues hold.”
5335,BOOK VII.,
5336,BOOK VII.,"Thus as he spoke, he donn’d his dazzling arms."
5337,BOOK VII.,"Then, Menelaus, had thine end approach’d"
5338,BOOK VII.,"By Hector’s hands, so much the stronger he,"
5339,BOOK VII.,Had not the Kings withheld thee and restrain’d.
5340,BOOK VII.,"Great Agamemnon’s self, wide-ruling King,"
5341,BOOK VII.,"Seizing his hand, address’d him thus by name:"
5342,BOOK VII.,"“What! Heav’n-born Menelaus, art thou mad?"
5343,BOOK VII.,"Beseems thee not such folly; curb thy wrath,"
5344,BOOK VII.,"Though vex’d; nor think with Hector to contend,"
5345,BOOK VII.,"Thy better far, inspiring dread in all."
5346,BOOK VII.,"From his encounter in the glorious fight,"
5347,BOOK VII.,"Superior far to thee, Achilles shrinks;"
5348,BOOK VII.,But thou amid thy comrades’ ranks retire;
5349,BOOK VII.,Some other champion will the Greeks provide;
5350,BOOK VII.,"And, fearless as he is, and of the fight"
5351,BOOK VII.,"Insatiate, yet will Hector, should he ’scape"
5352,BOOK VII.,"Unwounded from the deadly battle-strife,"
5353,BOOK VII.,"Be fain, methinks, to rest his weary limbs.”"
5354,BOOK VII.,
5355,BOOK VII.,"He said, and with judicious counsel sway’d"
5356,BOOK VII.,"His brother’s mind; he yielded to his words,"
5357,BOOK VII.,And gladly his attendants doff’d his arms.
5358,BOOK VII.,
5359,BOOK VII.,"Then Nestor rose, and thus address’d the Greeks:"
5360,BOOK VII.,"“Alas, alas! what shame is this for Greece!"
5361,BOOK VII.,"What grief would fill the aged Peleus’ soul,"
5362,BOOK VII.,"Sage chief in council, of the Myrmidons"
5363,BOOK VII.,"Leader approv’d, who often in his house"
5364,BOOK VII.,"Would question me, and lov’d from me to hear"
5365,BOOK VII.,"Of all the Greeks the race and pedigree,"
5366,BOOK VII.,Could he but learn how Hector cow’d them all!
5367,BOOK VII.,He to the Gods with hands uprais’d would pray
5368,BOOK VII.,"His soul might from his body be divorc’d,"
5369,BOOK VII.,"And sink beneath the earth! Oh would to Jove,"
5370,BOOK VII.,"To Pallas and Apollo, such were now"
5371,BOOK VII.,"My vig’rous youth, as when beside the banks"
5372,BOOK VII.,"Of swiftly-flowing Celadon, the men"
5373,BOOK VII.,"Of Pylos with th’ Arcadian spearmen fought,"
5374,BOOK VII.,"By Pheia’s walls, around Iardan’s streams."
5375,BOOK VII.,"Then from the ranks, in likeness as a God,"
5376,BOOK VII.,"Advanc’d their champion, Ereuthalion bold."
5377,BOOK VII.,The arms of Areithous he wore:
5378,BOOK VII.,"Of godlike Areithous, whom men"
5379,BOOK VII.,And richly-girdled women had surnam’d
5380,BOOK VII.,The Macebearer; for not with sword or bow
5381,BOOK VII.,"He went to fight, but with an iron mace"
5382,BOOK VII.,"Broke through the squadrons: him Lycurgus slew,"
5383,BOOK VII.,"By stealth, not brav’ry, in a narrow way,"
5384,BOOK VII.,Where nought avail’d his iron mace from death
5385,BOOK VII.,"To save him; for Lycurgus, with his spear,"
5386,BOOK VII.,"Preventing, thrust him through the midst; he fell"
5387,BOOK VII.,Prostrate; and from his breast the victor stripp’d
5388,BOOK VII.,"His armour off, the gift of brass-clad Mars;"
5389,BOOK VII.,And in the tug of war he wore it oft;
5390,BOOK VII.,"But when Lycurgus felt th’ approach of age,"
5391,BOOK VII.,"He to his faithful follower and friend,"
5392,BOOK VII.,"To Ereuthalion gave it; therewith, arm’d,"
5393,BOOK VII.,He now to combat challeng’d all the chiefs.
5394,BOOK VII.,"None dar’d accept, for fear had fallen on all;"
5395,BOOK VII.,"Then I with dauntless spirit his might oppos’d,"
5396,BOOK VII.,"The youngest of them all; with him I fought,"
5397,BOOK VII.,And Pallas gave the vict’ry to my arm.
5398,BOOK VII.,"Him there I slew, the tallest, strongest man;"
5399,BOOK VII.,For many another there beside him lay.
5400,BOOK VII.,Would that my youth and strength were now the same;
5401,BOOK VII.,Then soon should Hector of the glancing helm
5402,BOOK VII.,"A willing champion find; but ye, of Greece"
5403,BOOK VII.,"The foremost men, with Hector fear to fight.”"
5404,BOOK VII.,
5405,BOOK VII.,The old man spoke reproachful; at his words
5406,BOOK VII.,"Up rose nine warriors: far before the rest,"
5407,BOOK VII.,"The monarch Agamemnon, King of men;"
5408,BOOK VII.,"Next Tydeus’ son, the valiant Diomed;"
5409,BOOK VII.,"The two Ajaces, cloth’d with courage high;"
5410,BOOK VII.,"Idomeneus, and of Idomeneus"
5411,BOOK VII.,"The faithful follower, brave Meriones,"
5412,BOOK VII.,Equal in fight to blood-stain’d Mars; with these
5413,BOOK VII.,"Eurypylus, Euaemon’s noble son;"
5414,BOOK VII.,"Thoas, Andraemon’s son; Ulysses last:"
5415,BOOK VII.,These all with Hector offer’d to contend.
5416,BOOK VII.,Then thus again Gerenian Nestor spoke:
5417,BOOK VII.,"“Shake then the lots; on whomsoe’er it fall,"
5418,BOOK VII.,"Great profit shall he bring to Grecian arms,"
5419,BOOK VII.,"Great glory to himself, if he escape"
5420,BOOK VII.,Unwounded from the deadly battle strife.”
5421,BOOK VII.,"He said: each mark’d his sev’ral lot, and all"
5422,BOOK VII.,Together threw in Agamemnon’s helm.
5423,BOOK VII.,"The crowd, with hands uplifted, pray’d the Gods,"
5424,BOOK VII.,"And looking heav’nward, said, “Grant, Father Jove,"
5425,BOOK VII.,"The lot on Ajax, or on Tydeus’ son,"
5426,BOOK VII.,Or on Mycenæ’s wealthy King may fall.”
5427,BOOK VII.,
5428,BOOK VII.,"Thus they: then aged Nestor shook the helm,"
5429,BOOK VII.,"And forth, according to their wish, was thrown"
5430,BOOK VII.,The lot of Ajax; then from left to right
5431,BOOK VII.,"A herald show’d to all the chiefs of Greece,"
5432,BOOK VII.,"In turn, the token; they who knew it not,"
5433,BOOK VII.,Disclaim’d it all; but when to him he came
5434,BOOK VII.,"Who mark’d, and threw it in Atrides’ helm,"
5435,BOOK VII.,"The noble Ajax, and, approaching, placed"
5436,BOOK VII.,"The token in his outstretch’d hand, forthwith"
5437,BOOK VII.,"He knew it, and rejoic’d; before his feet"
5438,BOOK VII.,"He threw it down upon the ground, and said,"
5439,BOOK VII.,"“O friends, the lot is mine; great is my joy,"
5440,BOOK VII.,And hope o’er godlike Hector to prevail.
5441,BOOK VII.,"But now, while I my warlike armour don,"
5442,BOOK VII.,"Pray ye to Saturn’s royal son, apart,"
5443,BOOK VII.,"In silence, that the Trojans hear ye not;"
5444,BOOK VII.,"Or ev’n aloud, for nought have we to fear."
5445,BOOK VII.,"No man against my will can make me fly,"
5446,BOOK VII.,"By greater force or skill; nor will, I hope,"
5447,BOOK VII.,My inexperience in the field disgrace
5448,BOOK VII.,The teaching of my native Salamis.”
5449,BOOK VII.,
5450,BOOK VII.,Thus he; and they to Saturn’s royal son
5451,BOOK VII.,"Address’d their pray’rs, and looking heav’nward, said:"
5452,BOOK VII.,"“O Father Jove, who rul’st on Ida’s height!"
5453,BOOK VII.,Most great! most glorious! grant that Ajax now
5454,BOOK VII.,"May gain the vict’ry, and immortal praise:"
5455,BOOK VII.,"Or if thy love and pity Hector claim,"
5456,BOOK VII.,Give equal pow’r and equal praise to both.”
5457,BOOK VII.,
5458,BOOK VII.,Ajax meanwhile in dazzling brass was clad;
5459,BOOK VII.,"And when his armour all was duly donn’d,"
5460,BOOK VII.,"Forward he mov’d, as when gigantic Mars"
5461,BOOK VII.,"Leads nations forth to war, whom Saturn’s son"
5462,BOOK VII.,In life-destroying conflict hath involv’d;
5463,BOOK VII.,"So mov’d the giant Ajax, prop of Greece,"
5464,BOOK VII.,With sternly smiling mien; with haughty stride
5465,BOOK VII.,"He trod the plain, and pois’d his pond’rous spear."
5466,BOOK VII.,"The Greeks, rejoicing, on their champion gaz’d,"
5467,BOOK VII.,The Trojans’ limbs beneath them shook with fear;
5468,BOOK VII.,Ev’n Hector’s heart beat quicker in his breast;
5469,BOOK VII.,"Yet quail he must not now, nor back retreat"
5470,BOOK VII.,"Amid his comrades—he, the challenger!"
5471,BOOK VII.,"Ajax approach’d; before him, as a tow’r"
5472,BOOK VII.,"His mighty shield he bore, sev’n-fold, brass-bound,"
5473,BOOK VII.,"The work of Tychius, best artificer"
5474,BOOK VII.,That wrought in leather; he in Hyla dwelt.
5475,BOOK VII.,Of sev’n-fold hides the pond’rous shield was wrought
5476,BOOK VII.,Of lusty bulls; the eighth was glitt’ring brass.
5477,BOOK VII.,This by the son of Telamon was borne
5478,BOOK VII.,"Before his breast; to Hector close he came,"
5479,BOOK VII.,And thus with words of haughty menace spoke:
5480,BOOK VII.,
5481,BOOK VII.,"“Hector, I now shall teach thee, man to man,"
5482,BOOK VII.,"The mettle of the chiefs we yet possess,"
5483,BOOK VII.,"Although Achilles of the lion heart,"
5484,BOOK VII.,"Mighty in battle, be not with us still;"
5485,BOOK VII.,He by his ocean-going ships indeed
5486,BOOK VII.,Against Atrides nurses still his wrath;
5487,BOOK VII.,"Yet are there those who dare encounter thee,"
5488,BOOK VII.,And not a few; then now begin the fight.”
5489,BOOK VII.,
5490,BOOK VII.,To whom great Hector of the glancing helm:
5491,BOOK VII.,"“Ajax, brave leader, son of Telamon,"
5492,BOOK VII.,"Deal not with me as with a feeble child,"
5493,BOOK VII.,"Or woman, ign’rant of the ways of war;"
5494,BOOK VII.,Of war and carnage every point I know;
5495,BOOK VII.,"And well I know to wield, now right, now left,"
5496,BOOK VII.,The tough bull’s-hide that forms my stubborn targe:
5497,BOOK VII.,"Well know I too my fiery steeds to urge,"
5498,BOOK VII.,And raise the war-cry in the standing fight.
5499,BOOK VII.,"But not in secret ambush would I watch,"
5500,BOOK VII.,"To strike, by stealth, a noble foe like thee;"
5501,BOOK VII.,"But slay thee, if I may, in open fight.”"
5502,BOOK VII.,
5503,BOOK VII.,"He said; and, poising, hurl’d his pond’rous spear;"
5504,BOOK VII.,"The brazen cov’ring of the shield it struck,"
5505,BOOK VII.,"The outward fold, the eighth, above the sev’n"
5506,BOOK VII.,Of tough bull’s-hide; through six it drove its way
5507,BOOK VII.,"With stubborn force; but in the seventh was stay’d,"
5508,BOOK VII.,"Then Ajax hurl’d in turn his pond’rous spear,"
5509,BOOK VII.,And struck the circle true of Hector’s shield;
5510,BOOK VII.,"Right thro’ the glitt’ring shield the stout spear pass’d,"
5511,BOOK VII.,And thro’ the well-wrought breastplate drove its way;
5512,BOOK VII.,"And, underneath, the linen vest it tore;"
5513,BOOK VII.,"But Hector, stooping, shunn’d the stroke of death."
5514,BOOK VII.,"Withdrawing then their weapons, each on each"
5515,BOOK VII.,"They fell, like lions fierce, or tusked boars,"
5516,BOOK VII.,In strength the mightiest of the forest beasts.
5517,BOOK VII.,Then Hector fairly on the centre struck
5518,BOOK VII.,The stubborn shield; yet drove not through the spear;
5519,BOOK VII.,For the stout brass the blunted point repell’d.
5520,BOOK VII.,"But Ajax, with a forward bound, the shield"
5521,BOOK VII.,Of Hector pierc’d; right through the weapon pass’d;
5522,BOOK VII.,"Arrested with rude shock the warrior’s course,"
5523,BOOK VII.,"And graz’d his neck, that spouted forth the blood."
5524,BOOK VII.,Yet did not Hector of the glancing helm
5525,BOOK VII.,"Flinch from the contest: stooping to the ground,"
5526,BOOK VII.,"With his broad hand a pond’rous stone he seiz’d,"
5527,BOOK VII.,"That lay upon the plain, dark, jagg’d, and huge,"
5528,BOOK VII.,"And hurl’d against the sev’n-fold shield, and struck"
5529,BOOK VII.,Full on the central boss; loud rang the brass:
5530,BOOK VII.,Then Ajax rais’d a weightier mass of rock
5531,BOOK VII.,"And sent it whirling, giving to his arm"
5532,BOOK VII.,Unmeasur’d impulse; with a millstone’s weight
5533,BOOK VII.,It crush’d the buckler; Hector’s knees gave way;
5534,BOOK VII.,"Backward he stagger’d, yet upon his shield"
5535,BOOK VII.,"Sustain’d, till Phoebus rais’d him to his feet."
5536,BOOK VII.,"Now had they hand to hand with swords engag’d,"
5537,BOOK VII.,"Had not the messengers of Gods and men,"
5538,BOOK VII.,"The heralds, interpos’d; the one for Troy,"
5539,BOOK VII.,"The other umpire for the brass-clad Greeks,"
5540,BOOK VII.,"Talthybius and Idaeus, well approv’d."
5541,BOOK VII.,"Between the chiefs they held their wands, and thus"
5542,BOOK VII.,Idaeus both with prudent speech address’d:
5543,BOOK VII.,"“No more, brave youths! no longer wage the fight:"
5544,BOOK VII.,"To cloud-compelling Jove ye both are dear,"
5545,BOOK VII.,"Both valiant spearmen; that, we all have seen."
5546,BOOK VII.,Night is at hand; behoves us yield to night.”
5547,BOOK VII.,
5548,BOOK VII.,Whom answer’d thus the son of Telamon:
5549,BOOK VII.,"“Idaeus, bid that Hector speak those words:"
5550,BOOK VII.,He challeng’d all our chiefs; let him begin:
5551,BOOK VII.,"If he be willing, I shall not refuse.”"
5552,BOOK VII.,
5553,BOOK VII.,To whom great Hector of the glancing helm:
5554,BOOK VII.,"“Ajax, since God hath giv’n thee size, and strength,"
5555,BOOK VII.,"And skill; and with the spear, of all the Greeks"
5556,BOOK VII.,None is thine equal; cease we for to-day
5557,BOOK VII.,"The fight; hereafter we may meet, and Heav’n"
5558,BOOK VII.,"Decide our cause, and one with vict’ry crown."
5559,BOOK VII.,Night is at hand; behoves us yield to night.
5560,BOOK VII.,"So by the ships shalt thou rejoice the Greeks,"
5561,BOOK VII.,"And most of all, thy comrades and thy friends;"
5562,BOOK VII.,"And so shall I, in Priam’s royal town,"
5563,BOOK VII.,"Rejoice the men of Troy, and long-rob’d dames,"
5564,BOOK VII.,Who shall with grateful pray’rs the temples throng.
5565,BOOK VII.,"But make we now an interchange of gifts,"
5566,BOOK VII.,"That both the Trojans and the Greeks may say,"
5567,BOOK VII.,"‘On mortal quarrel did those warriors meet,"
5568,BOOK VII.,Yet parted thence in friendly bonds conjoin’d.’”
5569,BOOK VII.,
5570,BOOK VII.,"This said, a silver-studded sword he gave,"
5571,BOOK VII.,With scabbard and with well-cut belt complete;
5572,BOOK VII.,"Ajax a girdle, rich with crimson dye."
5573,BOOK VII.,"They parted; Ajax to the Grecian camp,"
5574,BOOK VII.,And Hector to the ranks of Troy return’d:
5575,BOOK VII.,"Great was the joy when him they saw approach,"
5576,BOOK VII.,Alive and safe; escap’d from Ajax’ might
5577,BOOK VII.,And arm invincible; and tow’rd the town
5578,BOOK VII.,"They led him back, beyond their hope preserv’d;"
5579,BOOK VII.,While to Atrides’ tent the well-greav’d Greeks
5580,BOOK VII.,"Led Ajax, glorying in his triumph gain’d."
5581,BOOK VII.,
5582,BOOK VII.,"But when to Agamemnon’s tents they came,"
5583,BOOK VII.,The King of men to Saturn’s royal son
5584,BOOK VII.,"A bullock slew, a male of five years old;"
5585,BOOK VII.,"The carcase then they flay’d; and cutting up,"
5586,BOOK VII.,"Sever’d the joints; then fixing on the spits,"
5587,BOOK VII.,"Roasted with care, and from the fire withdrew."
5588,BOOK VII.,"Their labours ended, and the feast prepar’d,"
5589,BOOK VII.,"They shar’d the social meal, nor lack’d there aught."
5590,BOOK VII.,"To Ajax then the chine’s continuous length,"
5591,BOOK VII.,"As honour’s meed, the mighty monarch gave."
5592,BOOK VII.,"The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,"
5593,BOOK VII.,The aged Nestor first his mind disclos’d;
5594,BOOK VII.,"He who, before, the sagest counsel gave,"
5595,BOOK VII.,"Now thus with prudent speech began, and said:"
5596,BOOK VII.,"“Atrides, and ye other chiefs of Greece,"
5597,BOOK VII.,"Since many a long-hair’d Greek hath fall’n in fight,"
5598,BOOK VII.,"Whose blood, beside Scamander’s flowing stream,"
5599,BOOK VII.,"Fierce Mars has shed, while to the viewless shades"
5600,BOOK VII.,"Their spirits are gone, behoves thee with the morn"
5601,BOOK VII.,The warfare of the Greeks to intermit:
5602,BOOK VII.,"Then we, with oxen and with mules, the dead"
5603,BOOK VII.,"From all the plain will draw; and, from the ships"
5604,BOOK VII.,"A little space remov’d, will burn with fire:"
5605,BOOK VII.,"That we, returning to our native land,"
5606,BOOK VII.,May to their children bear our comrades’ bones.
5607,BOOK VII.,"Then will we go, and on the plain erect"
5608,BOOK VII.,Around the pyre one common mound for all;
5609,BOOK VII.,Then quickly build before it lofty tow’rs
5610,BOOK VII.,To screen both ships and men; and in the tow’rs
5611,BOOK VII.,"Make ample portals, with well-fitting gates,"
5612,BOOK VII.,That through the midst a carriage-way may pass:
5613,BOOK VII.,"And a deep trench around it dig, to guard"
5614,BOOK VII.,"Both men and chariots, lest on our defence"
5615,BOOK VII.,The haughty Trojans should too hardly press.”
5616,BOOK VII.,
5617,BOOK VII.,He said; and all the Kings his words approv’d.
5618,BOOK VII.,"Meanwhile, on Ilium’s height, at Priam’s gate"
5619,BOOK VII.,The Trojan chiefs a troubled council held;
5620,BOOK VII.,"Which op’ning, thus the sage Antenor spoke:"
5621,BOOK VII.,"“Hear now, ye Trojans, Dardans, and Allies,"
5622,BOOK VII.,"The words I speak, the promptings of my soul."
5623,BOOK VII.,Back to the sons of Atreus let us give
5624,BOOK VII.,"The Argive Helen, and the goods she brought;"
5625,BOOK VII.,For now in breach of plighted faith we fight:
5626,BOOK VII.,"Nor can I hope, unless to my advice"
5627,BOOK VII.,"Ye listen, that success will crown our arms.”"
5628,BOOK VII.,"Thus having said, he sat; and next arose"
5629,BOOK VII.,"The godlike Paris, fair-hair’d Helen’s Lord;"
5630,BOOK VII.,Who thus with winged words the chiefs address’d:
5631,BOOK VII.,"“Hostile to me, Antenor, is thy speech;"
5632,BOOK VII.,Thy better judgment better counsel knows;
5633,BOOK VII.,"But if in earnest such is thine advice,"
5634,BOOK VII.,Thee of thy senses have the Gods bereft.
5635,BOOK VII.,"Now, Trojans, hear my answer; I reject"
5636,BOOK VII.,"The counsel, nor the woman will restore;"
5637,BOOK VII.,"But for the goods, whate’er I hither brought"
5638,BOOK VII.,"To Troy from Argos, I am well content"
5639,BOOK VII.,"To give them all, and others add beside.”"
5640,BOOK VII.,
5641,BOOK VII.,"This said, he sat; and aged Priam next,"
5642,BOOK VII.,"A God in council, Dardan’s son, arose,"
5643,BOOK VII.,"Who thus with prudent speech began, and said:"
5644,BOOK VII.,
5645,BOOK VII.,"“Hear now, ye Trojans, Dardans, and Allies,"
5646,BOOK VII.,"The words I speak, the promptings of my soul:"
5647,BOOK VII.,Now through the city take your wonted meal;
5648,BOOK VII.,"Look to your watch, let each man keep his guard:"
5649,BOOK VII.,To-morrow shall Idaeus to the ships
5650,BOOK VII.,"Of Greece, to both the sons of Atreus, bear"
5651,BOOK VII.,"The words of Paris, cause of all this war;"
5652,BOOK VII.,"And ask besides, if from the deadly strife"
5653,BOOK VII.,Such truce they will accord us as may serve
5654,BOOK VII.,To burn the dead; hereafter we may fight
5655,BOOK VII.,"Till Heav’n decide, and one with vict’ry crown.”"
5656,BOOK VII.,
5657,BOOK VII.,"He said; and they, obedient to his word,"
5658,BOOK VII.,Throughout the ranks prepar’d the wonted meal:
5659,BOOK VII.,But with the morning to the ships of Greece
5660,BOOK VII.,Idaeus took his way: in council there
5661,BOOK VII.,By Agamemnon’s leading ship he found
5662,BOOK VII.,"The Grecian chiefs, the ministers of Mars:"
5663,BOOK VII.,And ’mid them all the clear-voic’d herald spoke:
5664,BOOK VII.,
5665,BOOK VII.,"“Ye sons of Atreus, and ye chiefs of Greece,"
5666,BOOK VII.,"From Priam, and the gallant sons of Troy,"
5667,BOOK VII.,"I come, to bear, if ye be pleas’d to hear,"
5668,BOOK VII.,"The words of Paris, cause of all this war:"
5669,BOOK VII.,The goods which hither in his hollow ships
5670,BOOK VII.,"(Would he had perish’d rather!) Paris brought,"
5671,BOOK VII.,"He will restore, and others add beside;"
5672,BOOK VII.,"But further says, the virgin-wedded wife"
5673,BOOK VII.,"Of Menelaus, though the gen’ral voice"
5674,BOOK VII.,Of Troy should bid him. he will not restore:
5675,BOOK VII.,"Then bids me ask, if from the deadly strife"
5676,BOOK VII.,Such truce ye will accord us as may serve
5677,BOOK VII.,To burn the dead: hereafter we may fight
5678,BOOK VII.,"Till Heav’n decide, and one with vict’ry crown.”"
5679,BOOK VII.,
5680,BOOK VII.,Thus he: they all in silence heard; at length
5681,BOOK VII.,"Uprose the valiant Diomed, and said;"
5682,BOOK VII.,“Let none from Paris now propose to accept
5683,BOOK VII.,"Or goods, or Helen’s self; a child may see"
5684,BOOK VII.,That now the doom of Troy is close at hand.”
5685,BOOK VII.,"He said; the sons of Greece, with loud applause,"
5686,BOOK VII.,The speech of valiant Diomed confirm’d.
5687,BOOK VII.,
5688,BOOK VII.,Then to Idaeus Agamemnon thus:
5689,BOOK VII.,"“Idaeus, thou hast heard what answer give"
5690,BOOK VII.,The chiefs of Greece—their answer I approve.
5691,BOOK VII.,"But for the truce, for burial of the dead,"
5692,BOOK VII.,I nought demur; no shame it is to grace
5693,BOOK VII.,With fun’ral rites the corpse of slaughter’d foes.
5694,BOOK VII.,"Be witness, Jove! and guard the plighted truce.”"
5695,BOOK VII.,
5696,BOOK VII.,He said: and heav’nward rais’d his staff; and back
5697,BOOK VII.,To Ilium’s walls Idaeus took his way.
5698,BOOK VII.,Trojans and Dardans there in council met
5699,BOOK VII.,"Expecting sat, till from the Grecian camp"
5700,BOOK VII.,"Idaeus should return; he came, and stood"
5701,BOOK VII.,"In mid assembly, and his message gave:"
5702,BOOK VII.,"Then all in haste their sev’ral ways dispers’d,"
5703,BOOK VII.,"For fuel some, and some to bring the dead."
5704,BOOK VII.,"The Greeks too from their well-mann’d ships went forth,"
5705,BOOK VII.,"For fuel some, and some to bring the dead."
5706,BOOK VII.,The sun was newly glancing on the earth.
5707,BOOK VII.,From out the ocean’s smoothly-flowing depths
5708,BOOK VII.,"Climbing the Heav’ns, when on the plain they met."
5709,BOOK VII.,Hard was it then to recognize the dead;
5710,BOOK VII.,"But when the gory dust was wash’d away,"
5711,BOOK VII.,"Shedding hot tears, they plac’d them on the wains."
5712,BOOK VII.,"Nor loud lament, by Priam’s high command,"
5713,BOOK VII.,"Was heard; in silence they, with grief suppress’d,"
5714,BOOK VII.,Heap’d up their dead upon the fun’ral pyre;
5715,BOOK VII.,"Then burnt with fire, and back return’d to Troy."
5716,BOOK VII.,"The well-greav’d Greeks, they too, with grief suppress’d,"
5717,BOOK VII.,Heap’d up their dead upon the fun’ral pyre;
5718,BOOK VII.,"Then burnt with fire, and to the ships return’d."
5719,BOOK VII.,
5720,BOOK VII.,"But ere ’twas morn, while daylight strove with night,"
5721,BOOK VII.,About the pyre a chosen band of Greeks
5722,BOOK VII.,"Had kept their vigil, and around it rais’d"
5723,BOOK VII.,Upon the plain one common mound for all;
5724,BOOK VII.,"And built in front a wall, with lofty tow’rs"
5725,BOOK VII.,To screen both ships and men; and in the tow’rs
5726,BOOK VII.,"Made ample portals with well-fitting gates,"
5727,BOOK VII.,That through the midst a carriage-way might pass:
5728,BOOK VII.,"Then dug a trench around it, deep and wide,"
5729,BOOK VII.,And in the trench a palisade they fix’d.
5730,BOOK VII.,
5731,BOOK VII.,Thus labour’d thro’ the night the long-hair’d Greeks:
5732,BOOK VII.,"The Gods, assembled in the courts of Jove,"
5733,BOOK VII.,With wonder view’d the mighty work; and thus
5734,BOOK VII.,"Neptune, Earth-shaking King, his speech began:"
5735,BOOK VII.,"“O Father Jove, in all the wide-spread earth"
5736,BOOK VII.,"Shall men be found, in counsel and design"
5737,BOOK VII.,To rival us Immortals? see’st thou not
5738,BOOK VII.,How round their ships the long-hair’d Greeks have built
5739,BOOK VII.,"A lofty wall, and dug a trench around,"
5740,BOOK VII.,Nor to the Gods have paid their off’rings due!
5741,BOOK VII.,Wide as the light extends shall be the fame
5742,BOOK VII.,"Of this great work, and men shall lightly deem"
5743,BOOK VII.,"Of that which I and Phoebus jointly rais’d,"
5744,BOOK VII.,"With toil and pain, for great Laomedon.”"
5745,BOOK VII.,
5746,BOOK VII.,To whom in wrath the Cloud-compeller thus:
5747,BOOK VII.,"“Neptune, Earth-shaking King, what words are these?"
5748,BOOK VII.,"This bold design to others of the Gods,"
5749,BOOK VII.,"Of feebler hands, and pow’r less great than thine,"
5750,BOOK VII.,"Might cause alarm; but, far as light extends,"
5751,BOOK VII.,Of this great work to thee shall be the fame:
5752,BOOK VII.,When with their ships the long-hair’d Greeks shall take
5753,BOOK VII.,"Their homeward voyage to their native land,"
5754,BOOK VII.,"This wall shall by the waves be broken through,"
5755,BOOK VII.,"And sink, a shapeless ruin, in the sea:"
5756,BOOK VII.,"O’er the wide shore again thy sands shall spread,"
5757,BOOK VII.,And all the boasted work of Greece o’erwhelm.”
5758,BOOK VII.,
5759,BOOK VII.,Amid themselves such converse held the Gods.
5760,BOOK VII.,The sun was set; the Grecian work was done;
5761,BOOK VII.,"They slew, and shar’d, by tents, the ev’ning meal."
5762,BOOK VII.,From Lemnos’ isle a num’rous fleet had come
5763,BOOK VII.,"Freighted with wine; and by Euneus sent,"
5764,BOOK VII.,Whom fair Hypsipyle to Jason bore.
5765,BOOK VII.,"For Atreus’ sons, apart from all the rest,"
5766,BOOK VII.,"Of wine, the son of Jason had despatch’d"
5767,BOOK VII.,A thousand measures; all the other Greeks
5768,BOOK VII.,"Hasten’d to purchase, some with brass, and some"
5769,BOOK VII.,"With gleaming iron; other some with hides,"
5770,BOOK VII.,"Cattle, or slaves; and joyous wax’d the feast."
5771,BOOK VII.,"All night the long-hair’d Greeks their revels held,"
5772,BOOK VII.,"And so in Troy, the Trojans and Allies:"
5773,BOOK VII.,But through the night his anger Jove express’d
5774,BOOK VII.,With awful thunderings; pale they turn’d with fear:
5775,BOOK VII.,"To earth the wine was from the goblets shed,"
5776,BOOK VII.,"Nor dar’d they drink, until libations due"
5777,BOOK VII.,Had first been pour’d to Saturn’s mighty son.
5778,BOOK VII.,
5779,BOOK VII.,"Then lay they down, and sought the boon of sleep."

5811,BOOK VIII.,"Now morn, in saffron robe, the earth o’erspread;"
5812,BOOK VIII.,"And Jove, the lightning’s Lord, of all the Gods"
5813,BOOK VIII.,A council held upon the highest peak
5814,BOOK VIII.,Of many-ridg’d Olympus; he himself
5815,BOOK VIII.,Address’d them; they his speech attentive heard.
5816,BOOK VIII.,
5817,BOOK VIII.,"“Hear, all ye Gods, and all ye Goddesses,"
5818,BOOK VIII.,"The words I speak, the promptings of my soul."
5819,BOOK VIII.,"Let none among you, male or female, dare"
5820,BOOK VIII.,"To thwart my counsels: rather all concur,"
5821,BOOK VIII.,That so these matters I may soon conclude.
5822,BOOK VIII.,"If, from the rest apart, one God I find"
5823,BOOK VIII.,Presuming or to Trojans or to Greeks
5824,BOOK VIII.,"To give his aid, with ignominious stripes"
5825,BOOK VIII.,Back to Olympus shall that God be driv’n;
5826,BOOK VIII.,"Or to the gloom of Tartarus profound,"
5827,BOOK VIII.,"Far off, the lowest abyss beneath the earth,"
5828,BOOK VIII.,"With, gates of iron, and with floor of brass,"
5829,BOOK VIII.,"Beneath the shades as far as earth from Heav’n,"
5830,BOOK VIII.,"There will I hurl him, and ye all shall know"
5831,BOOK VIII.,In strength how greatly I surpass you all.
5832,BOOK VIII.,"Make trial if ye will, that all may know."
5833,BOOK VIII.,"A golden cord let down from Heav’n, and all,"
5834,BOOK VIII.,"Both Gods and Goddesses, your strength, apply:"
5835,BOOK VIII.,"Yet would ye fail to drag from Heav’n to earth,"
5836,BOOK VIII.,"Strive as ye may, your mighty master, Jove;"
5837,BOOK VIII.,"But if I choose to make my pow’r be known,"
5838,BOOK VIII.,"The earth itself, and ocean, I could raise,"
5839,BOOK VIII.,"And binding round Olympus’ ridge the cord,"
5840,BOOK VIII.,Leave them suspended so in middle air:
5841,BOOK VIII.,So far supreme my pow’r o’er Gods and men.”
5842,BOOK VIII.,
5843,BOOK VIII.,"He said, and they, confounded by his words,"
5844,BOOK VIII.,In silence sat; so sternly did he speak.
5845,BOOK VIII.,"At length the blue-ey’d Goddess, Pallas, said:"
5846,BOOK VIII.,"“O Father, Son of Saturn, King of Kings,"
5847,BOOK VIII.,Well do we know thy pow’r invincible;
5848,BOOK VIII.,"Yet deeply grieve we for the warlike Greeks,"
5849,BOOK VIII.,"Condemn’d to hopeless ruin; from the fight,"
5850,BOOK VIII.,"Since such is thy command, we stand aloof;"
5851,BOOK VIII.,"But yet some saving counsel may we give,"
5852,BOOK VIII.,Lest in thine anger thou destroy them quite.”
5853,BOOK VIII.,
5854,BOOK VIII.,"To whom the Cloud-compeller, smiling, thus:"
5855,BOOK VIII.,"“Be of good cheer, my child; unwillingly"
5856,BOOK VIII.,"I speak, yet will not thwart thee of thy wish.”"
5857,BOOK VIII.,
5858,BOOK VIII.,"He said, and straight the brazen-footed steeds,"
5859,BOOK VIII.,"Of swiftest flight, with manes of flowing gold,"
5860,BOOK VIII.,He harness’d to his chariot; all in gold
5861,BOOK VIII.,"Himself array’d, the golden lash he grasp’d,"
5862,BOOK VIII.,"Of curious work; and mounting on his car,"
5863,BOOK VIII.,"Urg’d the fleet coursers; nothing loth, they flew"
5864,BOOK VIII.,Midway betwixt the earth and starry heav’n.
5865,BOOK VIII.,"To Ida’s spring-abounding hill he came,"
5866,BOOK VIII.,"And to the crest of Gargarus, wild nurse"
5867,BOOK VIII.,"Of mountain beasts; a sacred plot was there,"
5868,BOOK VIII.,Whereon his incense-honour’d altar stood:
5869,BOOK VIII.,There stay’d his steeds the Sire of Gods and men
5870,BOOK VIII.,"Loos’d from the car, and veil’d with clouds around."
5871,BOOK VIII.,"Then on the topmost ridge he sat, in pride"
5872,BOOK VIII.,"Of conscious strength; and looking down, survey’d"
5873,BOOK VIII.,"The Trojan city, and the ships of Greece."
5874,BOOK VIII.,
5875,BOOK VIII.,"Meantime, the Greeks throughout their tents in haste"
5876,BOOK VIII.,"Despatch’d their meal, and arm’d them for the fight;"
5877,BOOK VIII.,"On th’ other side the Trojans donn’d their arms,"
5878,BOOK VIII.,"In numbers fewer, but with stern resolve,"
5879,BOOK VIII.,"By hard necessity constrain’d, to strive,"
5880,BOOK VIII.,"For wives and children, in the stubborn fight."
5881,BOOK VIII.,"The gates all open’d wide, forth pour’d the crowd"
5882,BOOK VIII.,Of horse and foot; and loud the clamour rose.
5883,BOOK VIII.,"When in the midst they met, together rush’d"
5884,BOOK VIII.,"Bucklers and lances, and the furious might"
5885,BOOK VIII.,Of mail-clad warriors; bossy shield on shield
5886,BOOK VIII.,Clatter’d in conflict; loud the clamour rose:
5887,BOOK VIII.,Then rose too mingled shouts and groans of men
5888,BOOK VIII.,Slaying and slain; the earth ran red with blood.
5889,BOOK VIII.,"While yet ’twas morn, and wax’d the youthful day,"
5890,BOOK VIII.,"Thick flew the shafts, and fast the people fell"
5891,BOOK VIII.,On either side; but when the sun had reach’d
5892,BOOK VIII.,"The middle Heav’n, th’ Eternal Father hung"
5893,BOOK VIII.,"His golden scales aloft, and plac’d in each"
5894,BOOK VIII.,The fatal death-lot: for the sons of Troy
5895,BOOK VIII.,"The one, the other for the brass-clad Greeks;"
5896,BOOK VIII.,Then held them by the midst; down sank the lot
5897,BOOK VIII.,"Of Greece, down to the ground, while high aloft"
5898,BOOK VIII.,"Mounted the Trojan scale, and rose to Heav’n.[2]"
5899,BOOK VIII.,Then loud he bade the volleying thunder peal
5900,BOOK VIII.,From Ida’s heights; and ’mid the Grecian ranks
5901,BOOK VIII.,He hurl’d his flashing lightning; at the sight
5902,BOOK VIII.,"Amaz’d they stood, and pale with terror shook."
5903,BOOK VIII.,
5904,BOOK VIII.,"Then not Idomeneus, nor Atreus’ son,"
5905,BOOK VIII.,"The mighty Agamemnon, kept their ground,"
5906,BOOK VIII.,"Nor either Ajax, ministers of Mars;"
5907,BOOK VIII.,"Gerenian Nestor, aged prop of Greece,"
5908,BOOK VIII.,"Alone remain’d, and he against his will,"
5909,BOOK VIII.,His horse sore wounded by an arrow shot
5910,BOOK VIII.,"By godlike Paris, fair-hair’d Helen’s Lord:"
5911,BOOK VIII.,"Just on the crown, where close behind the head"
5912,BOOK VIII.,"First springs the mane, the deadliest spot of all,"
5913,BOOK VIII.,The arrow struck him; madden’d with the pain
5914,BOOK VIII.,"He rear’d, then plunging forward, with the shaft"
5915,BOOK VIII.,"Fix’d in his brain, and rolling in the dust,"
5916,BOOK VIII.,The other steeds in dire confusion threw;
5917,BOOK VIII.,And while old Nestor with his sword essay’d
5918,BOOK VIII.,"To cut the reins, and free the struggling horse,"
5919,BOOK VIII.,Amid the rout down came the flying steeds
5920,BOOK VIII.,"Of Hector, guided by no timid hand,"
5921,BOOK VIII.,By Hector’s self; then had the old man paid
5922,BOOK VIII.,"The forfeit of his life, but, good at need,"
5923,BOOK VIII.,"The valiant Diomed his peril saw,"
5924,BOOK VIII.,"And loudly shouting, on Ulysses call’d:"
5925,BOOK VIII.,"“Ulysses sage, Laertes’ godlike son,"
5926,BOOK VIII.,"Why fliest thou, coward-like, amid the throng,"
5927,BOOK VIII.,And in thy flight to the aim of hostile spears
5928,BOOK VIII.,"Thy back presenting? stay, and here with me"
5929,BOOK VIII.,From this fierce warrior guard the good old man.”
5930,BOOK VIII.,
5931,BOOK VIII.,"He said; but stout Ulysses heard him not,"
5932,BOOK VIII.,And to the ships pursued his hurried way.
5933,BOOK VIII.,"But in the front, Tydides, though alone,"
5934,BOOK VIII.,Remain’d undaunted; by old Nestor’s car
5935,BOOK VIII.,"He stood, and thus the aged chief address’d:"
5936,BOOK VIII.,"“Old man, these youthful warriors press thee sore,"
5937,BOOK VIII.,"Thy vigour spent, and with the weight of years"
5938,BOOK VIII.,"Oppress’d; and helpless too thy charioteer,"
5939,BOOK VIII.,"And slow thy horses; mount my car, and prove"
5940,BOOK VIII.,"How swift my steeds, or in pursuit or flight,"
5941,BOOK VIII.,"From those of Tros descended, scour the plain;"
5942,BOOK VIII.,My noble prize from great Æneas won.
5943,BOOK VIII.,Leave to th’ attendants these; while mine we launch
5944,BOOK VIII.,"Against the Trojan host, that Hector’s self"
5945,BOOK VIII.,May know how strong my hand can hurl the spear.”
5946,BOOK VIII.,
5947,BOOK VIII.,He said; and Nestor his advice obey’d:
5948,BOOK VIII.,"The two attendants, valiant Sthenelus,"
5949,BOOK VIII.,"And good Eurymedon, his horses took,"
5950,BOOK VIII.,While on Tydides’ car they mounted both.
5951,BOOK VIII.,"The aged Nestor took the glitt’ring reins,"
5952,BOOK VIII.,And urg’d the horses; Hector soon they met:
5953,BOOK VIII.,"As on he came, his spear Tydides threw,"
5954,BOOK VIII.,"Yet struck not Hector; but his charioteer,"
5955,BOOK VIII.,"Who held the reins, the brave Thebaeus’ son,"
5956,BOOK VIII.,"Eniopeus, through the breast transfix’d,"
5957,BOOK VIII.,"Beside the nipple; from the car he fell,"
5958,BOOK VIII.,The startled horses swerving at the sound;
5959,BOOK VIII.,And from his limbs the vital spirit fled.
5960,BOOK VIII.,"Deep, for his comrade slain, was Hector’s grief;"
5961,BOOK VIII.,"Yet him, though griev’d, perforce he left to seek"
5962,BOOK VIII.,A charioteer; nor wanted long his steeds
5963,BOOK VIII.,"A guiding hand; for Archeptolemus,"
5964,BOOK VIII.,"Brave son of Iphitus, he quickly found,"
5965,BOOK VIII.,"And bade him mount his swiftly-flying car,"
5966,BOOK VIII.,And to his hands the glitt’ring reins transferr’d.
5967,BOOK VIII.,
5968,BOOK VIII.,"Then fearful ruin had been wrought, and deeds"
5969,BOOK VIII.,"Untold achiev’d, and like a flock of lambs,"
5970,BOOK VIII.,"The adverse hosts been coop’d beneath the walls,"
5971,BOOK VIII.,"Had not the Sire of Gods and men beheld,"
5972,BOOK VIII.,And with an awful peal of thunder hurl’d
5973,BOOK VIII.,His vivid lightning down; the fiery bolt
5974,BOOK VIII.,Before Tydides’ chariot plough’d the ground.
5975,BOOK VIII.,"Fierce flash’d the sulph’rous flame, and whirling round"
5976,BOOK VIII.,Beneath the yoke th’ affrighted horses quailed.
5977,BOOK VIII.,
5978,BOOK VIII.,"From Nestor’s hand escap’d the glitt’ring reins,"
5979,BOOK VIII.,"And, trembling, thus to Diomed he spoke:"
5980,BOOK VIII.,
5981,BOOK VIII.,"“Turn we to flight, Tydides; see’st thou not,"
5982,BOOK VIII.,That Jove from us his aiding hand withholds?
5983,BOOK VIII.,This day to Hector Saturn’s son decrees
5984,BOOK VIII.,"The meed of vict’ry; on some future day,"
5985,BOOK VIII.,"If so he will, the triumph may be ours;"
5986,BOOK VIII.,"For man, how brave soe’er, cannot o’errule"
5987,BOOK VIII.,"The will of Jove, so much the mightier he.”"
5988,BOOK VIII.,
5989,BOOK VIII.,Whom answer’d thus the valiant Diomed:
5990,BOOK VIII.,"“Truly, old man, and wisely dost thou speak;"
5991,BOOK VIII.,But this the bitter grief that wrings my soul:
5992,BOOK VIII.,"Some day, amid the councillors of Troy"
5993,BOOK VIII.,"Hector may say, ‘Before my presence scar’d"
5994,BOOK VIII.,Tydides sought the shelter of the ships.’
5995,BOOK VIII.,"Thus when he boasts, gape earth, and hide my shame!”"
5996,BOOK VIII.,
5997,BOOK VIII.,To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
5998,BOOK VIII.,"“Great son of Tydeus, oh what words are these!"
5999,BOOK VIII.,"Should Hector brand thee with a coward’s name,"
6000,BOOK VIII.,"No credence would he gain from Trojan men,"
6001,BOOK VIII.,"Or Dardan, or from Trojan warriors’ wives,"
6002,BOOK VIII.,Whose husbands in the dust thy hand hath laid.”
6003,BOOK VIII.,
6004,BOOK VIII.,"He said, and ’mid the general rout, to flight"
6005,BOOK VIII.,"He turn’d his horses; on the flying crowd,"
6006,BOOK VIII.,"With shouts of triumph, Hector at their head,"
6007,BOOK VIII.,The men of Troy their murd’rous weapons show’r’d.
6008,BOOK VIII.,Loud shouted Hector of the glancing helm:
6009,BOOK VIII.,"“Tydides, heretofore the warrior Greeks"
6010,BOOK VIII.,Have held thee in much honour; plac’d on high
6011,BOOK VIII.,"At banquets, and with lib’ral portions grac’d,"
6012,BOOK VIII.,"And flowing cups: but thou, from this day forth,"
6013,BOOK VIII.,Shalt be their scorn! a woman’s soul is thine!
6014,BOOK VIII.,"Out on thee, frighten’d girl! thou ne’er shalt scale"
6015,BOOK VIII.,"Our Trojan tow’rs, and see me basely fly;"
6016,BOOK VIII.,Nor in thy ships our women bear away:
6017,BOOK VIII.,"Ere such thy boast, my hand shall work thy doom.”"
6018,BOOK VIII.,
6019,BOOK VIII.,Thus he; and greatly was Tydides mov’d
6020,BOOK VIII.,"To turn his horses, and confront his foe:"
6021,BOOK VIII.,"Thrice thus he doubted; thrice, at Jove’s command,"
6022,BOOK VIII.,"From Ida’s height the thunder peal’d, in sign"
6023,BOOK VIII.,Of vict’ry swaying to the Trojan side.
6024,BOOK VIII.,Then to the Trojans Hector call’d aloud:
6025,BOOK VIII.,"“Trojans, and Lycians, and ye Dardans, fam’d"
6026,BOOK VIII.,"In close encounter, quit ye now like men;"
6027,BOOK VIII.,Put forth your wonted valour; for I know
6028,BOOK VIII.,That in his secret counsels Jove designs
6029,BOOK VIII.,"Glory to me, disaster to the Greeks."
6030,BOOK VIII.,"Fools, in those wretched walls that put their trust,"
6031,BOOK VIII.,"Scarce worthy notice, hopeless to withstand"
6032,BOOK VIII.,"My onset; and the trench that they have dug,"
6033,BOOK VIII.,Our horses easily can overleap;
6034,BOOK VIII.,"And when I reach the ships, be mindful ye,"
6035,BOOK VIII.,"To have at hand the fire, wherewith the ships"
6036,BOOK VIII.,"We may destroy, while they themselves shall fall"
6037,BOOK VIII.,"An easy prey, bewilder’d by the smoke.”"
6038,BOOK VIII.,
6039,BOOK VIII.,"He said, and thus with cheering words address’d"
6040,BOOK VIII.,"His horses: “Xanthus, and, Podargus, thou,"
6041,BOOK VIII.,"Æthon and Lampus, now repay the care"
6042,BOOK VIII.,"On you bestow’d by fair Andromache,"
6043,BOOK VIII.,Eetion’s royal daughter; bear in mind
6044,BOOK VIII.,How she with ample store of provender
6045,BOOK VIII.,"Your mangers still supplied, before e’en I,"
6046,BOOK VIII.,"Her husband, from her hands the wine-cup took."
6047,BOOK VIII.,"Put forth your speed, that we may make our prize"
6048,BOOK VIII.,"Of Nestor’s shield, whose praise extends to Heav’n,"
6049,BOOK VIII.,"Its handles, and itself, of solid gold;"
6050,BOOK VIII.,And from the shoulders of Tydides strip
6051,BOOK VIII.,"His gorgeous breastplate, work of Vulcan’s hand:"
6052,BOOK VIII.,"These could we take, methinks this very night"
6053,BOOK VIII.,Would see the Greeks embarking on their ships.”
6054,BOOK VIII.,
6055,BOOK VIII.,Such was his pray’r; but Juno on her throne
6056,BOOK VIII.,"Trembled with rage, till great Olympus quak’d,"
6057,BOOK VIII.,"And thus to Neptune, mighty God, she spoke:"
6058,BOOK VIII.,"“O thou of boundless might, Earth-shaking God,"
6059,BOOK VIII.,See’st thou unmov’d the ruin of the Greeks?
6060,BOOK VIII.,"Yet they in Ægae and in Helice,"
6061,BOOK VIII.,With grateful off’rings rich thine altars crown;
6062,BOOK VIII.,Then give we them the vict’ry; if we all
6063,BOOK VIII.,"Who favour Greece, together should combine"
6064,BOOK VIII.,"To put to flight the Trojans, and restrain"
6065,BOOK VIII.,"All-seeing Jove, he might be left alone,"
6066,BOOK VIII.,On Ida’s summit to digest his wrath.”
6067,BOOK VIII.,
6068,BOOK VIII.,"To whom, in anger, Neptune thus replied:"
6069,BOOK VIII.,"“O Juno, rash of speech, what words are these!"
6070,BOOK VIII.,I dare not counsel that we all should join
6071,BOOK VIII.,’Gainst Saturn’s son; so much the stronger he.”
6072,BOOK VIII.,
6073,BOOK VIII.,Such converse held they; all the space meanwhile
6074,BOOK VIII.,"Within the trench, between the tow’r and ships,"
6075,BOOK VIII.,Was closely throng’d with steeds and buckler’d men;
6076,BOOK VIII.,"By noble Hector, brave as Mars, and led"
6077,BOOK VIII.,"By Jove to vict’ry, coop’d in narrow space;"
6078,BOOK VIII.,"Who now had burnt with fire the Grecian ships,"
6079,BOOK VIII.,But Juno bade Atrides haste to rouse
6080,BOOK VIII.,Their fainting courage; through the camp he pass’d;
6081,BOOK VIII.,"On his broad hand a purple robe he bore,"
6082,BOOK VIII.,"And stood upon Ulysses’ lofty ship,"
6083,BOOK VIII.,"The midmost, whence to shout to either side,"
6084,BOOK VIII.,"Or to the tents of Ajax Telamon,"
6085,BOOK VIII.,"Or of Achilles, who at each extreme,"
6086,BOOK VIII.,"Confiding in their strength, had moor’d their ships."
6087,BOOK VIII.,
6088,BOOK VIII.,"Thence to the Greeks he shouted, loud and clear:"
6089,BOOK VIII.,"“Shame on ye, Greeks, base cowards, brave alone"
6090,BOOK VIII.,In outward semblance! where are now the vaunts
6091,BOOK VIII.,Which once (so highly of ourselves we deem’d)
6092,BOOK VIII.,"Ye made, vain-glorious braggarts as ye were,"
6093,BOOK VIII.,"In Lemnos’ isle, when, feasting on the flesh"
6094,BOOK VIII.,"Of straight-horn’d oxen, and your flowing cups"
6095,BOOK VIII.,"Crowning with ruddy wine, not one of you,"
6096,BOOK VIII.,"But for a hundred Trojans in the field,"
6097,BOOK VIII.,"Or for two hundred, deem’d himself a match:"
6098,BOOK VIII.,"Now quail ye all before a single man,"
6099,BOOK VIII.,"Hector, who soon will wrap our ships in fire."
6100,BOOK VIII.,O Father Jove! what sov’reign e’er hast thou
6101,BOOK VIII.,"So far deluded, of such glory robb’d?"
6102,BOOK VIII.,"Yet ne’er, on this disastrous voyage bent,"
6103,BOOK VIII.,Have I unheeded pass’d thine altar by;
6104,BOOK VIII.,"The choicest off’rings burning still on each,"
6105,BOOK VIII.,In hopes to raze the well-built walls of Troy.
6106,BOOK VIII.,Yet to this pray’r at least thine ear incline;
6107,BOOK VIII.,"Grant that this coast in safety we may leave,"
6108,BOOK VIII.,Nor be by Trojans utterly subdued.”
6109,BOOK VIII.,
6110,BOOK VIII.,"He said; and Jove, with pity, saw his tears;"
6111,BOOK VIII.,"And, with a sign, his people’s safety vouch’d."
6112,BOOK VIII.,"He sent an eagle, noblest bird that flies,"
6113,BOOK VIII.,Who in his talons bore a wild deer’s fawn:
6114,BOOK VIII.,"The fawn he dropp’d beside the holy shrine,"
6115,BOOK VIII.,"Where to the Lord of divination, Jove,"
6116,BOOK VIII.,The Greeks were wont their solemn rites to pay.
6117,BOOK VIII.,The sign from Heav’n they knew; with courage fresh
6118,BOOK VIII.,"Assail’d the Trojans, and the fight renew’d."
6119,BOOK VIII.,Then none of all the many Greeks might boast
6120,BOOK VIII.,"That he, before Tydides, drove his car"
6121,BOOK VIII.,"Across the ditch, and mingled in the fight."
6122,BOOK VIII.,"His was the hand that first a crested chief,"
6123,BOOK VIII.,"The son of Phradmon, Agelaus, struck."
6124,BOOK VIII.,"He turn’d his car for flight; but as he turn’d,"
6125,BOOK VIII.,"The lance of Diomed, behind his neck,"
6126,BOOK VIII.,"Between the shoulders, through his chest was driv’n;"
6127,BOOK VIII.,"Headlong he fell, and loud his armour rang."
6128,BOOK VIII.,
6129,BOOK VIII.,"Next to Tydides, Agamemnon came,"
6130,BOOK VIII.,"And Menelaus, Atreus’ godlike sons;"
6131,BOOK VIII.,"Th’ Ajaces both, in dauntless courage cloth’d;"
6132,BOOK VIII.,"Idomeneus, with whom Meriones,"
6133,BOOK VIII.,"His faithful comrade, terrible as Mars;"
6134,BOOK VIII.,"Eurypylus, Euaemon’s noble son;"
6135,BOOK VIII.,"The ninth was Teucer, who, with bended bow,"
6136,BOOK VIII.,Behind the shield of Ajax Telamon
6137,BOOK VIII.,Took shelter; Ajax o’er him held his shield;
6138,BOOK VIII.,"Thence look’d he round, and aim’d amid the crowd;"
6139,BOOK VIII.,"And as he saw each Trojan, wounded, fall,"
6140,BOOK VIII.,"Struck by his shafts, to Ajax close he press’d,"
6141,BOOK VIII.,"As to its mother’s shelt’ring arms a child,"
6142,BOOK VIII.,Conceal’d and safe beneath the ample targe.
6143,BOOK VIII.,
6144,BOOK VIII.,"Say then, who first of all the Trojans fell"
6145,BOOK VIII.,"By Teucer’s arrows slain? Orsilochus,"
6146,BOOK VIII.,"And Ophelestes, Daetor, Ormenus,"
6147,BOOK VIII.,"And godlike Lycophontes, Chromius,"
6148,BOOK VIII.,"And Amopaon, Polyaemon’s son,"
6149,BOOK VIII.,"And valiant Melanippus: all of these,"
6150,BOOK VIII.,"Each after other, Teucer laid in dust."
6151,BOOK VIII.,"Him Agamemnon, with his well-strung bow"
6152,BOOK VIII.,"Thinning the Trojan ranks, with joy beheld,"
6153,BOOK VIII.,"And, standing at his side, address’d him thus:"
6154,BOOK VIII.,"“Teucer, good comrade, son of Telamon,"
6155,BOOK VIII.,"Shoot ever thus, if thou wouldst be the light"
6156,BOOK VIII.,"And glory of the Greeks, and of thy sire,"
6157,BOOK VIII.,"Who nursed thine infancy, and in his house"
6158,BOOK VIII.,"Maintain’d, though bastard; him, though distant far,"
6159,BOOK VIII.,To highest fame let thine achievements raise.
6160,BOOK VIII.,"This too I say, and will make good my word:"
6161,BOOK VIII.,"If by the grace of aegis-bearing Jove,"
6162,BOOK VIII.,"And Pallas, Ilium’s well-built walls we raze,"
6163,BOOK VIII.,"A gift of honour, second but to mine,"
6164,BOOK VIII.,"I in thy hands will place; a tripod bright,"
6165,BOOK VIII.,"Or, with their car and harness, two brave steeds,"
6166,BOOK VIII.,Or a fair woman who thy bed may share.”
6167,BOOK VIII.,
6168,BOOK VIII.,To whom in answer valiant Teucer thus:
6169,BOOK VIII.,"“Most mighty son of Atreus, why excite"
6170,BOOK VIII.,Who lacks not zeal? To th’ utmost of my pow’r
6171,BOOK VIII.,"Since first we drove the Trojans back, I watch,"
6172,BOOK VIII.,"Unceasing, every chance to ply my shafts."
6173,BOOK VIII.,"Eight barbed arrows have I shot e’en now,"
6174,BOOK VIII.,And in a warrior each has found its mark;
6175,BOOK VIII.,That savage hound alone defeats my aim.”
6176,BOOK VIII.,
6177,BOOK VIII.,"At Hector, as he spoke, another shaft"
6178,BOOK VIII.,"He shot, ambitious of so great a prize:"
6179,BOOK VIII.,He miss’d his aim; but Priam’s noble son
6180,BOOK VIII.,"Gorgythion, through the breast his arrow struck,"
6181,BOOK VIII.,"Whom from Æsyme brought, a wedded bride"
6182,BOOK VIII.,"Of heavenly beauty, Castianeira bore."
6183,BOOK VIII.,"Down sank his head, as in a garden sinks"
6184,BOOK VIII.,A ripen’d poppy charg’d with vernal rains;
6185,BOOK VIII.,So sank his head beneath his helmet’s weight.
6186,BOOK VIII.,At Hector yet another arrow shot
6187,BOOK VIII.,"Teucer, ambitious of so great a prize;"
6188,BOOK VIII.,"Yet this too miss’d, by Phoebus turn’d aside;"
6189,BOOK VIII.,"But Archeptolemus, the charioteer"
6190,BOOK VIII.,"Of Hector, onward hurrying, through the breast"
6191,BOOK VIII.,"It struck, beside the nipple; from the car"
6192,BOOK VIII.,He fell; aside the startled horses swerv’d;
6193,BOOK VIII.,And as he fell the vital spirit fled.
6194,BOOK VIII.,"Deep, for his comrade slain, was Hector’s grief;"
6195,BOOK VIII.,"Yet him, though griev’d at heart, perforce he left,"
6196,BOOK VIII.,"And to Cebriones, his brother, call’d,"
6197,BOOK VIII.,"Then near at hand, the horses’ reins to take;"
6198,BOOK VIII.,"He heard, and straight obey’d; then Hector leap’d"
6199,BOOK VIII.,"Down from his glitt’ring chariot to the ground,"
6200,BOOK VIII.,His fearful war-cry shouting; in his hand
6201,BOOK VIII.,"A pond’rous stone he carried; and, intent"
6202,BOOK VIII.,"To strike him down, at Teucer straight he rush’d."
6203,BOOK VIII.,"He from his quiver chose a shaft in haste,"
6204,BOOK VIII.,And fitted to the cord; but as he drew
6205,BOOK VIII.,"The sinew, Hector of the glancing helm"
6206,BOOK VIII.,"Hurl’d the huge mass of rock, which Teucer struck"
6207,BOOK VIII.,"Near to the shoulder, where the collar-bone"
6208,BOOK VIII.,"Joins neck and breast, the spot most opportune,"
6209,BOOK VIII.,"And broke the tendon; paralys’d, his arm"
6210,BOOK VIII.,Dropp’d helpless by his side; upon his knees
6211,BOOK VIII.,"He fell, and from his hands let fall the bow."
6212,BOOK VIII.,"Not careless Ajax saw his brother’s fall,"
6213,BOOK VIII.,But o’er him spread in haste his cov’ring shield.
6214,BOOK VIII.,"Two faithful friends, Mecisteus, Echius’ son,"
6215,BOOK VIII.,"And brave Alastor, from the press withdrew,"
6216,BOOK VIII.,"And bore him, deeply groaning, to the ships."
6217,BOOK VIII.,
6218,BOOK VIII.,"Then Jove again the Trojan courage fir’d,"
6219,BOOK VIII.,And backward to the ditch they forc’d the Greeks.
6220,BOOK VIII.,"Proud of his prowess, Hector led them on;"
6221,BOOK VIII.,"And as a hound that, fleet of foot, o’ertakes"
6222,BOOK VIII.,"Or boar or lion, object of his chase,"
6223,BOOK VIII.,"Springs from behind, and fastens on his flank,"
6224,BOOK VIII.,"Yet careful watches, lest he turn to bay:"
6225,BOOK VIII.,"So Hector press’d upon the long-hair’d Greeks,"
6226,BOOK VIII.,Slaying the hindmost; they in terror fled.
6227,BOOK VIII.,"But, pass’d at length the ditch and palisade,"
6228,BOOK VIII.,"With loss of many by the Trojans slain,"
6229,BOOK VIII.,"Before the ships they rallied from their flight,"
6230,BOOK VIII.,And one to other call’d: and one and all
6231,BOOK VIII.,"With hands uplifted, pray’d to all the Gods;"
6232,BOOK VIII.,"While Hector, here and there, on ev’ry side"
6233,BOOK VIII.,"His flying coursers wheel’d, with eyes that flash’d"
6234,BOOK VIII.,"Awful as Gorgon’s, or as blood-stain’d Mars."
6235,BOOK VIII.,
6236,BOOK VIII.,"Juno, the white-arm’d Queen, with pity mov’d,"
6237,BOOK VIII.,To Pallas thus her winged words address’d:
6238,BOOK VIII.,"“O Heav’n, brave child of aegis-bearing Jove,"
6239,BOOK VIII.,"Can we, ev’n now, in this their sorest need,"
6240,BOOK VIII.,"Refuse the Greeks our aid, by one subdued,"
6241,BOOK VIII.,"One single man, of pride unbearable,"
6242,BOOK VIII.,"Hector, the son of Priam, who e’en now,"
6243,BOOK VIII.,Hath caus’d them endless grief?” To whom again
6244,BOOK VIII.,"The blue-ey’d Goddess, Pallas, thus replied:"
6245,BOOK VIII.,"“I too would fain behold him robb’d of life,"
6246,BOOK VIII.,In his own country slain by Grecian hands;
6247,BOOK VIII.,"But that my sire, by ill advice misled,"
6248,BOOK VIII.,"Rages in wrath, still thwarting all my plans;"
6249,BOOK VIII.,"Forgetting now how oft his son I sav’d,"
6250,BOOK VIII.,Sore wearied with the toils Eurystheus gave.
6251,BOOK VIII.,"Oft would his tears ascend to Heav’n, and oft"
6252,BOOK VIII.,From Heav’n would Jove despatch me to his aid;
6253,BOOK VIII.,"But if I then had known what now I know,"
6254,BOOK VIII.,When to the narrow gates of Pluto’s realm
6255,BOOK VIII.,He sent him forth to bring from Erebus
6256,BOOK VIII.,"Its guardian dog, he never had return’d"
6257,BOOK VIII.,In safety from the marge of Styx profound.
6258,BOOK VIII.,"He holds me now in hatred, and his ear"
6259,BOOK VIII.,"To Thetis lends, who kiss’d his knees, and touch’d"
6260,BOOK VIII.,"His beard, and pray’d him to avenge her son"
6261,BOOK VIII.,Achilles; yet the time shall come when I
6262,BOOK VIII.,Shall be once more his own dear blue-ey’d Maid.
6263,BOOK VIII.,"But haste thee now, prepare for us thy car,"
6264,BOOK VIII.,While to the house of aegis-bearing Jove
6265,BOOK VIII.,"I go, and don my armour for the fight,"
6266,BOOK VIII.,"To prove if Hector of the glancing helm,"
6267,BOOK VIII.,"The son of Priam, will unmov’d behold"
6268,BOOK VIII.,Us two advancing o’er the pass of war;
6269,BOOK VIII.,"Or if the flesh of Trojans, slain by Greeks,"
6270,BOOK VIII.,Shall sate the maw of rav’ning dogs and birds.”
6271,BOOK VIII.,
6272,BOOK VIII.,She said: the white-arm’d Queen her word obey’d.
6273,BOOK VIII.,"Juno, great Goddess, royal Saturn’s child,"
6274,BOOK VIII.,"The horses brought, with golden frontlets crown’d;"
6275,BOOK VIII.,"While Pallas, child of aegis-bearing Jove,"
6276,BOOK VIII.,Within her father’s threshold dropp’d her veil
6277,BOOK VIII.,"Of airy texture, work of her own hands;"
6278,BOOK VIII.,"The cuirass donn’d of cloud-compelling Jove,"
6279,BOOK VIII.,And stood accoutred for the bloody fray.
6280,BOOK VIII.,The fiery car she mounted; in her hand
6281,BOOK VIII.,"A spear she bore, long, weighty, tough; wherewith"
6282,BOOK VIII.,The mighty daughter of a mighty sire
6283,BOOK VIII.,Sweeps down the ranks of those her wrath pursues.
6284,BOOK VIII.,Then Juno sharply touch’d the flying steeds;
6285,BOOK VIII.,"Forthwith spontaneous opening, grated harsh"
6286,BOOK VIII.,"The heavenly portals, guarded by the Hours,"
6287,BOOK VIII.,"Who Heav’n and high Olympus have in charge,"
6288,BOOK VIII.,To roll aside or close the veil of cloud;
6289,BOOK VIII.,Through these th’ excited horses held their way.
6290,BOOK VIII.,
6291,BOOK VIII.,"From Ida’s heights the son of Saturn saw,"
6292,BOOK VIII.,"And, fill’d with wrath, the heav’nly messenger,"
6293,BOOK VIII.,"The golden-winged Iris, thus bespoke:"
6294,BOOK VIII.,"“Haste thee, swift Iris; turn them back, and warn"
6295,BOOK VIII.,That farther they advance not: ’tis not meet
6296,BOOK VIII.,That they and I in war should be oppos’d.
6297,BOOK VIII.,"This too I say, and will make good my words:"
6298,BOOK VIII.,Their flying horses I will lame; themselves
6299,BOOK VIII.,"Dash from their car, and break their chariot-wheels;"
6300,BOOK VIII.,And ten revolving years heal not the wound
6301,BOOK VIII.,Where strikes my lightning; so shall Pallas learn
6302,BOOK VIII.,What ’tis against her father to contend.
6303,BOOK VIII.,Juno less moves my wonder and my wrath;
6304,BOOK VIII.,"Whate’er I plan, ’tis still her wont to thwart.”"
6305,BOOK VIII.,Thus he: from Ida to Olympus’ height
6306,BOOK VIII.,The storm-swift Iris on her errand sped.
6307,BOOK VIII.,At many-ridg’d Olympus’ outer gate
6308,BOOK VIII.,"She met the Goddesses, and stay’d their course,"
6309,BOOK VIII.,And thus convey’d the sov’reign will of Jove:
6310,BOOK VIII.,
6311,BOOK VIII.,“Whither away? what madness fills your breasts?
6312,BOOK VIII.,"To give the Greeks your succour, Jove forbids;"
6313,BOOK VIII.,"And thus he threatens, and will make it good:"
6314,BOOK VIII.,Your flying horses he will lame; yourselves
6315,BOOK VIII.,"Dash from the car, and break your chariot-wheels;"
6316,BOOK VIII.,And ten revolving years heal not the wounds
6317,BOOK VIII.,"His lightning makes: so, Pallas, shalt thou learn"
6318,BOOK VIII.,What ’tis against thy father to contend.
6319,BOOK VIII.,Juno less moves his wonder and his wrath;
6320,BOOK VIII.,"Whate’er he plans, ’tis still her wont to thwart;"
6321,BOOK VIII.,"But over-bold and void of shame art thou,"
6322,BOOK VIII.,If against Jove thou dare to lift thy spear.”
6323,BOOK VIII.,
6324,BOOK VIII.,"Thus as she spoke, swift Iris disappear’d."
6325,BOOK VIII.,"Then Juno thus to Pallas spoke: “No more,"
6326,BOOK VIII.,"Daughter of aegis-bearing Jove, can we"
6327,BOOK VIII.,For mortal men his sov’reign will resist;
6328,BOOK VIII.,"Live they or die, as each man’s fate may be;"
6329,BOOK VIII.,"While he, ’twixt Greeks and Trojans, as ’tis meet,"
6330,BOOK VIII.,"His own designs accomplishing, decides.”"
6331,BOOK VIII.,"She said, and backward turn’d her horses’ heads."
6332,BOOK VIII.,"The horses from the car the Hours unyok’d,"
6333,BOOK VIII.,And safely tether’d in the heav’nly stalls;
6334,BOOK VIII.,"The car they rear’d against the inner wall,"
6335,BOOK VIII.,That brightly polish’d shone; the Goddesses
6336,BOOK VIII.,"Themselves meanwhile, amid th’ Immortals all,"
6337,BOOK VIII.,"With, sorrowing hearts on golden seats reclin’d."
6338,BOOK VIII.,
6339,BOOK VIII.,"Ere long, on swiftly-rolling chariot borne,"
6340,BOOK VIII.,"Jove to Olympus, to th’ abode of Gods,"
6341,BOOK VIII.,"From Ida’s height return’d: th’ earth-shaking God,"
6342,BOOK VIII.,"Neptune, unyok’d his steeds; and on the stand"
6343,BOOK VIII.,"Secur’d the car, and spread the cov’ring o’er."
6344,BOOK VIII.,Then on his golden throne all-seeing Jove
6345,BOOK VIII.,Sat down; beneath his feet Olympus shook.
6346,BOOK VIII.,Juno and Pallas only sat aloof;
6347,BOOK VIII.,"No word they utter’d, no enquiry made."
6348,BOOK VIII.,"Jove knew their thoughts, and thus address’d them both:"
6349,BOOK VIII.,"“Pallas and Juno, wherefore sit ye thus"
6350,BOOK VIII.,In angry silence? In the glorious fight
6351,BOOK VIII.,"No lengthen’d toil have ye sustain’d, to slay"
6352,BOOK VIII.,"The Trojans, whom your deadly hate pursues."
6353,BOOK VIII.,Not all the Gods that on Olympus dwell
6354,BOOK VIII.,"Could turn me from my purpose, such my might,"
6355,BOOK VIII.,And such the pow’r of my resistless hand;
6356,BOOK VIII.,But ye were struck with terror ere ye saw
6357,BOOK VIII.,"The battle-field, and fearful deeds of war."
6358,BOOK VIII.,"But this I say, and bear it in your minds,"
6359,BOOK VIII.,"Had I my lightning launch’d, and from your car"
6360,BOOK VIII.,"Had hurl’d ye down, ye ne’er had reach’d again"
6361,BOOK VIII.,"Olympus’ height, th’ immortal Gods’ abode.”"
6362,BOOK VIII.,
6363,BOOK VIII.,"So spoke the God; but, seated side by side,"
6364,BOOK VIII.,Juno and Pallas glances interchang’d
6365,BOOK VIII.,Of ill portent for Troy; Pallas indeed
6366,BOOK VIII.,"Sat silent, and, though inly wroth with Jove,"
6367,BOOK VIII.,Yet answer’d not a word; but Juno’s breast
6368,BOOK VIII.,"Could not contain her rage, and thus she spoke:"
6369,BOOK VIII.,"“What words, dread son of Saturn, dost thou speak?"
6370,BOOK VIII.,"Well do we know thy pow’r invincible,"
6371,BOOK VIII.,"Yet deeply grieve we for the warlike Greeks,"
6372,BOOK VIII.,"Condemn’d to hopeless ruin: from the fight,"
6373,BOOK VIII.,"Since such is thy command, we stand aloof;"
6374,BOOK VIII.,"But yet some saving counsel may we give,"
6375,BOOK VIII.,Lest in thine anger thou destroy them quite.”
6376,BOOK VIII.,
6377,BOOK VIII.,To whom the Cloud-compeller thus replied:
6378,BOOK VIII.,"“Yet greater slaughter, stag-ey’d Queen of Heav’n,"
6379,BOOK VIII.,"To-morrow shalt thou see, if so thou list,"
6380,BOOK VIII.,Wrought on the warrior Greeks by Saturn’s son;
6381,BOOK VIII.,For Hector’s proud career shall not be check’d
6382,BOOK VIII.,Until the wrath of Peleus’ godlike son
6383,BOOK VIII.,"Beside the ships be kindled, in the day"
6384,BOOK VIII.,"When round Patroclus’ corpse, in narrow space,"
6385,BOOK VIII.,"E’en by the vessels’ sterns, the war shall rage."
6386,BOOK VIII.,"Such is the voice of destiny: for thee,"
6387,BOOK VIII.,I reck not of thy wrath; nor should I care
6388,BOOK VIII.,Though thou wert thrust beneath the lowest deep
6389,BOOK VIII.,"Of earth and ocean, where Iapetus"
6390,BOOK VIII.,"And Saturn lie, uncheer’d by ray of sun"
6391,BOOK VIII.,"Or breath of air, in Tartarus profound."
6392,BOOK VIII.,"Though there thou wert to banishment consign’d,"
6393,BOOK VIII.,"I should not heed, but thy reproaches hear"
6394,BOOK VIII.,Unmov’d; for viler thing is none than thou.”
6395,BOOK VIII.,"He said, but white-arm’d Juno answer’d not."
6396,BOOK VIII.,
6397,BOOK VIII.,"The sun, now sunk beneath the ocean wave,"
6398,BOOK VIII.,Drew o’er the teeming earth the veil of night.
6399,BOOK VIII.,"The Trojans saw, reluctant, day’s decline;"
6400,BOOK VIII.,"But on the Greeks thrice welcome, thrice invoked"
6401,BOOK VIII.,"With earnest prayers, the shades of darkness fell."
6402,BOOK VIII.,
6403,BOOK VIII.,The noble Hector then to council call’d
6404,BOOK VIII.,The Trojan leaders; from the ships apart
6405,BOOK VIII.,"He led them, by the eddying river’s side,"
6406,BOOK VIII.,"To a clear space of ground, from corpses free."
6407,BOOK VIII.,"They from their cars dismounting, to the words"
6408,BOOK VIII.,Of godlike Hector listen’d: in his hand
6409,BOOK VIII.,"His massive spear he held, twelve cubits long,"
6410,BOOK VIII.,"Whose glitt’ring point flash’d bright, with hoop of gold"
6411,BOOK VIII.,"Encircled round; on this he leant, and said,"
6412,BOOK VIII.,"“Hear me, ye Trojans, Dardans, and Allies;"
6413,BOOK VIII.,I hop’d that to the breezy heights of Troy
6414,BOOK VIII.,"We might ere now in triumph have return’d,"
6415,BOOK VIII.,The Grecian ships and all the Greeks destroy’d:
6416,BOOK VIII.,"But night hath come too soon, and sav’d awhile"
6417,BOOK VIII.,The Grecian army and their stranded ships.
6418,BOOK VIII.,Then yield we to the night; prepare the meal;
6419,BOOK VIII.,"Unyoke your horses, and before them place"
6420,BOOK VIII.,Their needful forage; from the city bring
6421,BOOK VIII.,Oxen and sheep; the luscious wine provide;
6422,BOOK VIII.,Bring bread from out our houses; and collect
6423,BOOK VIII.,"Good store of fuel, that the livelong night,"
6424,BOOK VIII.,"E’en till the dawn of day, may broadly blaze"
6425,BOOK VIII.,"Our num’rous watchfires, and illume the Heav’ns;"
6426,BOOK VIII.,"Lest, e’en by night, the long-hair’d Greeks should seek"
6427,BOOK VIII.,"O’er the broad bosom of the sea to fly,"
6428,BOOK VIII.,"That so not unassail’d they may embark,"
6429,BOOK VIII.,"Nor undisturb’d; but haply some may bear,"
6430,BOOK VIII.,"E’en to their homes, the mem’ry of a wound"
6431,BOOK VIII.,"Receiv’d from spear or arrow, as on board"
6432,BOOK VIII.,They leap’d in haste; and others too may fear
6433,BOOK VIII.,To tempt with hostile arms the pow’r of Troy.
6434,BOOK VIII.,Then let the sacred heralds’ voice proclaim
6435,BOOK VIII.,"Throughout the city, that the stripling youths"
6436,BOOK VIII.,And hoary-headed sires allot themselves
6437,BOOK VIII.,In sev’ral watches to the Heav’n-built tow’rs.
6438,BOOK VIII.,"Charge too the women, in their houses each,"
6439,BOOK VIII.,To kindle blazing fires; let careful watch
6440,BOOK VIII.,"Be set, lest, in the absence of the men,"
6441,BOOK VIII.,The town by secret ambush be surpris’d.
6442,BOOK VIII.,"Such, valiant Trojans, is th’ advice I give;"
6443,BOOK VIII.,And what to-night your wisdom shall approve
6444,BOOK VIII.,"Will I, at morn, before the Trojans speak."
6445,BOOK VIII.,"Hopeful, to Jove I pray, and all the Gods,"
6446,BOOK VIII.,"To chase from hence these fate-inflicted hounds,"
6447,BOOK VIII.,By fate sent hither on their dark-ribb’d ships.
6448,BOOK VIII.,Now keep we through the night our watchful guard;
6449,BOOK VIII.,"And with the early dawn, equipp’d in arms,"
6450,BOOK VIII.,Upon their fleet our angry battle pour.
6451,BOOK VIII.,Then shall I know if Tydeus’ valiant son
6452,BOOK VIII.,"Back from the ships shall drive me to the walls,"
6453,BOOK VIII.,"Or I, triumphant, bear his bloody spoils:"
6454,BOOK VIII.,"To-morrow morn his courage will decide,"
6455,BOOK VIII.,If he indeed my onset will await.
6456,BOOK VIII.,"But ere to-morrow’s sun be high in Heav’n,"
6457,BOOK VIII.,"He, ’mid the foremost, if I augur right,"
6458,BOOK VIII.,"Wounded and bleeding in the dust shall lie,"
6459,BOOK VIII.,And many a comrade round him. Would to Heav’n
6460,BOOK VIII.,I were as sure to be from age and death
6461,BOOK VIII.,"Exempt, and held in honour as a God,"
6462,BOOK VIII.,"Phoebus, or Pallas, as I am assur’d"
6463,BOOK VIII.,The coming day is fraught with ill to Greece.”
6464,BOOK VIII.,
6465,BOOK VIII.,Thus Hector spoke; the Trojans shouted loud:
6466,BOOK VIII.,"Then from the yoke the sweating steeds they loos’d,"
6467,BOOK VIII.,And tether’d each beside their sev’ral cars:
6468,BOOK VIII.,Next from the city speedily they brought
6469,BOOK VIII.,Oxen and sheep; the luscious wine procur’d;
6470,BOOK VIII.,"Brought bread from out their houses, and good store"
6471,BOOK VIII.,"Of fuel gather’d; wafted from the plain,"
6472,BOOK VIII.,The winds to Heav’n the sav’ry odours bore.
6473,BOOK VIII.,"Full of proud hopes, upon the pass of war,"
6474,BOOK VIII.,All night they camp’d; and frequent blaz’d their fires.
6475,BOOK VIII.,
6476,BOOK VIII.,"As when in Heav’n, around the glitt’ring moon"
6477,BOOK VIII.,The stars shine bright amid the breathless air;
6478,BOOK VIII.,"And ev’ry crag, and ev’ry jutting peak"
6479,BOOK VIII.,"Stands boldly forth, and ev’ry forest glade;"
6480,BOOK VIII.,Ev’n to the gates of Heav’n is open’d wide
6481,BOOK VIII.,The boundless sky; shines each particular star
6482,BOOK VIII.,Distinct; joy fills the gazing shepherd’s heart.
6483,BOOK VIII.,"So bright, so thickly scatter’d o’er the plain,"
6484,BOOK VIII.,"Before the walls of Troy, between the ships"
6485,BOOK VIII.,"And Xanthus’ stream, the Trojan watchfires blaz’d."
6486,BOOK VIII.,
6487,BOOK VIII.,A thousand fires burnt brightly; and round each
6488,BOOK VIII.,Sat fifty warriors in the ruddy glare;
6489,BOOK VIII.,"Champing the provender before them laid,"
6490,BOOK VIII.,"Barley and rye, the tether’d horses stood"
6491,BOOK VIII.,"Beside the cars, and waited for the morn."

6519,BOOK IX.,"Thus kept their watch, the Trojans; but the Greeks"
6520,BOOK IX.,"Dire Panic held, companion of chill Fear,"
6521,BOOK IX.,Their bravest struck with grief unbearable.
6522,BOOK IX.,"As when two stormy winds ruffle the sea,"
6523,BOOK IX.,"Boreas and Zephyr, from the hills of Thrace"
6524,BOOK IX.,With sudden gust descending; the dark waves
6525,BOOK IX.,"Rear high their angry crests, and toss on shore"

6529,BOOK IX.,"Atrides, heart-struck, wander’d to and fro,"
6530,BOOK IX.,And to the clear-voic’d heralds gave command
6531,BOOK IX.,"To call, but not with proclamation loud,"
6532,BOOK IX.,Each sev’ral man to council; he himself
6533,BOOK IX.,"Spar’d not his labour, mixing with the chiefs."
6534,BOOK IX.,"Sadly they sat in council; Atreus’ son,"
6535,BOOK IX.,"Weeping, arose; as some dark-water’d fount"
6536,BOOK IX.,Pours o’er a craggy steep its gloomy stream;
6537,BOOK IX.,Then with deep groans th’ assembled Greeks address’d:
6538,BOOK IX.,"“O friends! the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
6539,BOOK IX.,"Grievous, and all unlook’d for, is the blow"
6540,BOOK IX.,Which Jove hath dealt me; by his promise led
6541,BOOK IX.,"I hop’d to raze the strong-built walls of Troy,"
6542,BOOK IX.,And home return in safety; but it seems
6543,BOOK IX.,"He falsifies his word, and bids me now"
6544,BOOK IX.,"Return to Argos, frustrate of my hope,"
6545,BOOK IX.,"Dishonour’d, and with grievous loss of men."
6546,BOOK IX.,Such now appears th’ o’er-ruling sov’reign will
6547,BOOK IX.,"Of Saturn’s son, who oft hath sunk the heads"
6548,BOOK IX.,"Of many a lofty city in the dust,"
6549,BOOK IX.,And yet will sink; for mighty is his hand.
6550,BOOK IX.,Hear then my counsel; let us all agree
6551,BOOK IX.,Home to direct our course: since here in vain
6552,BOOK IX.,We strive to take the well-built walls of Troy.”
6553,BOOK IX.,
6554,BOOK IX.,The monarch spoke; they all in silence heard:
6555,BOOK IX.,In speechless sorrow long they sat: at length
6556,BOOK IX.,"Rose valiant Diomed, and thus he spoke:"
6557,BOOK IX.,"“Atrides, I thy folly must confront,"
6558,BOOK IX.,"As is my right, in council: thou, O King!"
6559,BOOK IX.,"Be not offended: once, among the Greeks"
6560,BOOK IX.,"Thou heldest light my prowess, with the name"
6561,BOOK IX.,Of coward branding me; how justly so
6562,BOOK IX.,"Is known to all the Greeks, both young and old."
6563,BOOK IX.,On thee the deep-designing Saturn’s son
6564,BOOK IX.,In diff’ring measure hath his gifts bestow’d:
6565,BOOK IX.,"A throne he gives thee, higher far than all;"
6566,BOOK IX.,"But valour, noblest boon of Heav’n, denies."
6567,BOOK IX.,How canst thou hope the sons of Greece shall prove
6568,BOOK IX.,Such heartless dastards as thy words suppose?
6569,BOOK IX.,"If homeward to return thy mind be fix’d,"
6570,BOOK IX.,"Depart; the way is open, and the ships,"
6571,BOOK IX.,"Which from Mycenæ follow’d thee in crowds,"
6572,BOOK IX.,"Are close at hand, and ready to be launch’d."
6573,BOOK IX.,Yet will the other long-hair’d Greeks remain
6574,BOOK IX.,"Till Priam’s city fall: nay, though the rest"
6575,BOOK IX.,"Betake them to their ships, and sail for home,"
6576,BOOK IX.,"Yet I and Sthenelus, we two, will fight"
6577,BOOK IX.,Till Troy be ours; for Heav’n is on our side.”
6578,BOOK IX.,
6579,BOOK IX.,"Thus he; the sons of Greece, with loud applause,"
6580,BOOK IX.,The speech of valiant Diomed confirm’d.
6581,BOOK IX.,
6582,BOOK IX.,"Then aged Nestor rose, and thus began:"
6583,BOOK IX.,"“Tydides, eminent thou art in war;"
6584,BOOK IX.,And In the council thy compeers in age
6585,BOOK IX.,"Must yield to thee; thy present words, no Greek"
6586,BOOK IX.,"Can censure, or gainsay; and yet the end"
6587,BOOK IX.,"Thou hast not reach’d, and object of debate."
6588,BOOK IX.,"But thou art young, and for thine age mightst be"
6589,BOOK IX.,My latest born; yet dost thou to the Kings
6590,BOOK IX.,"Sage counsel give, and well in season speak."
6591,BOOK IX.,"But now will I, that am thine elder far,"
6592,BOOK IX.,Go fully through the whole; and none my words
6593,BOOK IX.,"May disregard, not ev’n Atrides’ self."
6594,BOOK IX.,"Outcast from kindred, law, and hearth is he"
6595,BOOK IX.,Whose soul delights in fierce internal strife.
6596,BOOK IX.,But yield we now to th’ influence of night:
6597,BOOK IX.,Prepare the meal; and let the sev’ral guards
6598,BOOK IX.,"Be posted by the ditch, without the wall."
6599,BOOK IX.,This duty on the younger men I lay:
6600,BOOK IX.,"Then, Agamemnon, thou thy part perform;"
6601,BOOK IX.,"For thou art King supreme; the Elders all,"
6602,BOOK IX.,"As meet and seemly, to the feast invite:"
6603,BOOK IX.,"Thy tents are full of wine, which Grecian ships"
6604,BOOK IX.,O’er the wide sea bring day by day from Thrace;
6605,BOOK IX.,"Nor lack’st thou aught thy guests to entertain,"
6606,BOOK IX.,"And many own thy sway; when all are met,"
6607,BOOK IX.,"His counsel take, who gives the best advice;"
6608,BOOK IX.,"Great need we have of counsel wise and good,"
6609,BOOK IX.,When close beside our ships the hostile fires
6610,BOOK IX.,Are burning: who can this unmov’d behold?
6611,BOOK IX.,This night our ruin or our safety sees.”
6612,BOOK IX.,
6613,BOOK IX.,"He said; and they, assenting, heard his speech."
6614,BOOK IX.,"Forth with their followers went th’ appointed guards,"
6615,BOOK IX.,"The princely Thrasymedes, Nestor’s son,"
6616,BOOK IX.,"Ascalaphus, and bold Ialmenus,"
6617,BOOK IX.,"Two valiant sons of Mars; Meriones,"
6618,BOOK IX.,"And Aphareus, and brave Deipyrus,"
6619,BOOK IX.,"And godlike Lycomedes, Creon’s son."
6620,BOOK IX.,Sev’n were the leaders; and with each went forth
6621,BOOK IX.,"A hundred gallant youths, with lances arm’d."
6622,BOOK IX.,Between the ditch and wall they took their post;
6623,BOOK IX.,"There lit their fires, and there the meal prepar’d."
6624,BOOK IX.,
6625,BOOK IX.,Then for th’ assembled Elders in his tent
6626,BOOK IX.,An ample banquet Agamemnon spread;
6627,BOOK IX.,"They on the viands, set before them, fell:"
6628,BOOK IX.,"The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,"
6629,BOOK IX.,The aged Nestor first his mind disclos’d
6630,BOOK IX.,"He who, before, the sagest counsel gave,"
6631,BOOK IX.,"Now thus with prudent words began, and said:"
6632,BOOK IX.,
6633,BOOK IX.,"“Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
6634,BOOK IX.,"With thee, Atrides, my discourse shall end,"
6635,BOOK IX.,With thee begin: o’er many nations thou
6636,BOOK IX.,Hold’st sov’reign sway; since Jove to thee hath giv’n
6637,BOOK IX.,"The sceptre, and the high prerogative,"
6638,BOOK IX.,"To be thy people’s judge and counsellor,"
6639,BOOK IX.,"’Tis thine to speak the word, ’tis thine to hear"
6640,BOOK IX.,"And to determine, when some other chief"
6641,BOOK IX.,Suggestions offers in the gen’ral cause:
6642,BOOK IX.,"What counsel shall prevail, depends on thee:"
6643,BOOK IX.,Yet will I say what seems to me the best.
6644,BOOK IX.,"Sounder opinion none can hold than this,"
6645,BOOK IX.,"Which I maintain, and ever have maintain’d,"
6646,BOOK IX.,"Ev’n from the day when thou, great King, didst bear"
6647,BOOK IX.,The fair Briseis from Achilles’ tent
6648,BOOK IX.,Despite his anger—not by my advice:
6649,BOOK IX.,"I fain would have dissuaded thee, but thou,"
6650,BOOK IX.,"Following the dictates of thy wrathful pride,"
6651,BOOK IX.,"Didst to our bravest wrong, dishon’ring him"
6652,BOOK IX.,Whom ev’n th’ Immortals honour’d; for his prize
6653,BOOK IX.,Thou took’st and still retain’st; but let us now
6654,BOOK IX.,"Consider, if ev’n yet, with costly gifts"
6655,BOOK IX.,"And soothing words, we may his wrath appease.”"
6656,BOOK IX.,
6657,BOOK IX.,To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus:
6658,BOOK IX.,"“Father, too truly thou recall’st my fault:"
6659,BOOK IX.,"I err’d, nor will deny it; as a host"
6660,BOOK IX.,"Is he whom Jove in honour holds, as now"
6661,BOOK IX.,"Achilles hon’ring, he confounds the Greeks,"
6662,BOOK IX.,"But if I err’d, by evil impulse led,"
6663,BOOK IX.,"Fain would I now conciliate him, and pay"
6664,BOOK IX.,An ample penalty; before you all
6665,BOOK IX.,I pledge myself rich presents to bestow.
6666,BOOK IX.,"Sev’n tripods will I give, untouch’d by fire;"
6667,BOOK IX.,"Of gold, ten talents, twenty caldrons bright,"
6668,BOOK IX.,"Twelve pow’rful horses, on the course renown’d,"
6669,BOOK IX.,Who by their speed have many prizes won.
6670,BOOK IX.,"Not empty-handed could that man be deem’d,"
6671,BOOK IX.,"Nor poor in gold, who but so much possess’d"
6672,BOOK IX.,As by those horses has for me been won.
6673,BOOK IX.,"Sev’n women too, well skill’d in household cares,"
6674,BOOK IX.,"Lesbians, whom I selected for myself,"
6675,BOOK IX.,"That day he captur’d Lesbos’ goodly isle,"
6676,BOOK IX.,In beauty far surpassing all their sex:
6677,BOOK IX.,These will I give; and with them will I send
6678,BOOK IX.,"The fair Briseis, her whom from his tent"
6679,BOOK IX.,"I bore away; and add a solemn oath,"
6680,BOOK IX.,"I ne’er approach’d her bed, nor held with her"
6681,BOOK IX.,Such intercourse as man with woman holds.
6682,BOOK IX.,All these shall now be his: but if the Gods
6683,BOOK IX.,"Shall grant us Priam’s city to destroy,"
6684,BOOK IX.,"Of gold and brass, when we divide the spoil,"
6685,BOOK IX.,"With countless heaps he shall a vessel freight,"
6686,BOOK IX.,"And twenty captives he himself shall choose,"
6687,BOOK IX.,All only less than Argive Helen fair.
6688,BOOK IX.,And if it be our fate to see again
6689,BOOK IX.,"The teeming soil of Argos, he shall be"
6690,BOOK IX.,My son by marriage; and in honour held
6691,BOOK IX.,"As is Orestes, who, my only son,"
6692,BOOK IX.,Is rear’d at home in luxury and ease.
6693,BOOK IX.,"Three daughters fair I have, Chrysothemis,"
6694,BOOK IX.,"Iphianassa, and Laodice;"
6695,BOOK IX.,"Of these, whiche’er he will, to Peleus’ house,"
6696,BOOK IX.,"No portion ask’d for, he shall take to wife;"
6697,BOOK IX.,"And with her will I add such wedding gifts,"
6698,BOOK IX.,As never man before to daughter gave.
6699,BOOK IX.,"Sev’n prosp’rous towns besides; Cardamyle,"
6700,BOOK IX.,"And Enope, and Ira’s grassy plains;"
6701,BOOK IX.,"And Pherae, and Antheia’s pastures deep,"
6702,BOOK IX.,"Æpeia fair, and vine-clad Pedasus;"
6703,BOOK IX.,"All by the sea, by sandy Pylos’ bounds."
6704,BOOK IX.,"The dwellers there in flocks and herds are rich,"
6705,BOOK IX.,"And, as a God, shall honour him with gifts,"
6706,BOOK IX.,And to his sceptre ample tribute pay.
6707,BOOK IX.,"This will I do, so he his wrath remit:"
6708,BOOK IX.,Then let him yield (Pluto alone remains
6709,BOOK IX.,Unbending and inexorable; and thence
6710,BOOK IX.,"Of all the Gods is most abhorr’d of men),"
6711,BOOK IX.,"To me submitting, as in royal pow’r"
6712,BOOK IX.,"Superior far, and more advanc’d in age.”"
6713,BOOK IX.,
6714,BOOK IX.,To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
6715,BOOK IX.,"“Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
6716,BOOK IX.,"Atrides, not unworthy are the gifts,"
6717,BOOK IX.,Which to Achilles thou design’st to send:
6718,BOOK IX.,Then to the tent of Peleus’ son in haste
6719,BOOK IX.,Let us our chosen messengers despatch:
6720,BOOK IX.,"Whom I shall choose, let them consent to go."
6721,BOOK IX.,"Then first of all let Phoenix lead the way,"
6722,BOOK IX.,Beloved of Jove; the mighty Ajax next:
6723,BOOK IX.,"With them, Ulysses sage; and let them take,"
6724,BOOK IX.,"Of heralds, Hodius and Eurybates."
6725,BOOK IX.,Bring now the hallowing water for our hands;
6726,BOOK IX.,"And bid be silent, while to Saturn’s son,"
6727,BOOK IX.,"That he have mercy, we address our pray’r.”"
6728,BOOK IX.,
6729,BOOK IX.,"He said, and well his counsel pleas’d them all;"
6730,BOOK IX.,The heralds pour’d the water on their hands;
6731,BOOK IX.,"The youths, attending, crown’d the bowls with wine,"
6732,BOOK IX.,And in due order serv’d the cups to all.
6733,BOOK IX.,"Then, their libations made, when each with wine"
6734,BOOK IX.,"Had satisfied his soul, from out the tent"
6735,BOOK IX.,"Of Agamemnon, Atreus’ son, they pass’d;"
6736,BOOK IX.,"And many a caution aged Nestor gave,"
6737,BOOK IX.,"With rapid glance to each, Ulysses chief,"
6738,BOOK IX.,How best to soften Peleus’ matchless son.
6739,BOOK IX.,
6740,BOOK IX.,Beside the many-dashing ocean’s shore
6741,BOOK IX.,They mov’d along; and many a pray’r address’d
6742,BOOK IX.,"To Neptune, Ocean’s Earth-surrounding God,"
6743,BOOK IX.,That he to gentle counsels would incline
6744,BOOK IX.,The haughty soul of great Æacides.
6745,BOOK IX.,"When to the ships and tents they came, where lay"
6746,BOOK IX.,"The warlike Myrmidons, their chief they found"
6747,BOOK IX.,"His spirit soothing with a sweet-ton’d lyre,"
6748,BOOK IX.,"Of curious work, with silver band adorn’d;"
6749,BOOK IX.,"Part of the spoil he took, when he destroy’d"
6750,BOOK IX.,"Eetion’s wealthy town; on this he play’d,"
6751,BOOK IX.,"Soothing his soul, and sang of warriors’ deeds."
6752,BOOK IX.,"Before the chief, in silence and alone"
6753,BOOK IX.,"Patroclus sat, upon Achilles fix’d"
6754,BOOK IX.,"His eyes, awaiting till the song should cease."
6755,BOOK IX.,"The envoys forward stepp’d, Ulysses first,"
6756,BOOK IX.,"And stood before him; from his couch, amaz’d,"
6757,BOOK IX.,"And holding still his lyre, Achilles sprang,"
6758,BOOK IX.,Leaving the seat whereon they found him plac’d;
6759,BOOK IX.,And at their entrance rose Patroclus too:
6760,BOOK IX.,"Waving his hand, Achilles, swift of foot,"
6761,BOOK IX.,"Addressed them: “Welcome, friends! as friends ye come:"
6762,BOOK IX.,Some great occasion surely to my tent
6763,BOOK IX.,"Hath brought the men who are, of all the Greeks,"
6764,BOOK IX.,"Despite my anger, dearest to my heart.”"
6765,BOOK IX.,
6766,BOOK IX.,"Thus as he spoke, he led them in, and plac’d"
6767,BOOK IX.,"On couches spread with, purple carpets o’er,"
6768,BOOK IX.,Then thus address’d Patroclus at his side:
6769,BOOK IX.,"“Son of Menoetius, set upon the board"
6770,BOOK IX.,"A larger bowl, and stronger mix the wine,"
6771,BOOK IX.,And serve a cup to each: beneath my roof
6772,BOOK IX.,This night my dearest friends I entertain.”
6773,BOOK IX.,He said; Patroclus his commands obey’d;
6774,BOOK IX.,"And in the fire-light plac’d an ample tray,"
6775,BOOK IX.,And on it laid of goat’s flesh and of sheep’s
6776,BOOK IX.,"A saddle each; and with them, rich in fat,"
6777,BOOK IX.,A chine of well-fed hog; Automedon
6778,BOOK IX.,"Held fast, while great Achilles carv’d the joints."
6779,BOOK IX.,"The meat, prepar’d, he fix’d upon the spits:"
6780,BOOK IX.,Patroclus kindled then a blazing fire;
6781,BOOK IX.,"And when the fire burnt hotly, and the flame"
6782,BOOK IX.,"Subsided, spread the glowing embers out,"
6783,BOOK IX.,And hung the spits above; then sprinkled o’er
6784,BOOK IX.,"The meat with salt, and lifted from the stand."
6785,BOOK IX.,"The viands cook’d and plac’d upon the board,"
6786,BOOK IX.,From baskets fair Patroclus portion’d out
6787,BOOK IX.,The bread to each; the meat Achilles shar’d.
6788,BOOK IX.,"Facing the sage Ulysses, sat the host"
6789,BOOK IX.,"On th’ other side the tent; and bade his friend,"
6790,BOOK IX.,"Patroclus, give the Gods their honours due:"
6791,BOOK IX.,He in the fire the wonted off’rings burnt:
6792,BOOK IX.,They on the viands set before them fell.
6793,BOOK IX.,"The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,"
6794,BOOK IX.,Ajax to Phoenix sign’d: Ulysses saw
6795,BOOK IX.,"The sign, and rising, fill’d a cup with wine,"
6796,BOOK IX.,"And pledg’d Achilles thus: “To thee I drink,"
6797,BOOK IX.,"Achilles! nobly is thy table spread,"
6798,BOOK IX.,"As heretofore in Agamemnon’s tent,"
6799,BOOK IX.,So now in thine; abundant is the feast:
6800,BOOK IX.,But not the pleasures of the banquet now
6801,BOOK IX.,We have in hand: impending o’er our arms
6802,BOOK IX.,"Grave cause of fear, illustrious chief, we see;"
6803,BOOK IX.,"Grave doubts, to save, or see destroy’d our ships,"
6804,BOOK IX.,"If thou, great warrior, put not forth thy might."
6805,BOOK IX.,For close beside the ships and wall are camp’d
6806,BOOK IX.,The haughty Trojans and renown’d allies:
6807,BOOK IX.,Their watch-fires frequent burn throughout the camp;
6808,BOOK IX.,"And loud their boast that nought shall stay their hands,"
6809,BOOK IX.,Until our dark-ribb’d ships be made their prey.
6810,BOOK IX.,"Jove too for them, with fav’ring augury"
6811,BOOK IX.,"Sends forth his lightning; boastful of his strength,"
6812,BOOK IX.,"And firmly trusting in the aid of Jove,"
6813,BOOK IX.,"Hector, resistless, rages; nought he fears"
6814,BOOK IX.,"Or God or man, with martial fury fir’d."
6815,BOOK IX.,"He prays, impatient, for th’ approach of morn;"
6816,BOOK IX.,"Then, breaking through the lofty sterns, resolv’d"
6817,BOOK IX.,"To the devouring flames to give the ships,"
6818,BOOK IX.,"And slay the crews, bewilder’d in the smoke."
6819,BOOK IX.,"And much my mind misgives me, lest the Gods"
6820,BOOK IX.,"His threats fulfil, and we be fated here"
6821,BOOK IX.,"To perish, far from Argos’ grassy plains."
6822,BOOK IX.,Up then! if in their last extremity
6823,BOOK IX.,"Thy spirit inclines, though late, to save the Greeks"
6824,BOOK IX.,Sore press’d by Trojan arms: lest thou thyself
6825,BOOK IX.,Hereafter feel remorse; the evil done
6826,BOOK IX.,Is past all cure; then thou reflect betimes
6827,BOOK IX.,How from the Greeks to ward the day of doom.
6828,BOOK IX.,"Dear friend, remember now thy father’s words,"
6829,BOOK IX.,"The aged Peleus, when to Atreus’ son"
6830,BOOK IX.,"He sent thee forth from Phthia, how he said,"
6831,BOOK IX.,"‘My son, the boon of strength, if so they will,"
6832,BOOK IX.,Juno or Pallas have the pow’r to give;
6833,BOOK IX.,But thou thyself thy haughty spirit must curb.
6834,BOOK IX.,For better far is gentle courtesy:
6835,BOOK IX.,"And cease from angry strife, that so the Greeks"
6836,BOOK IX.,"The more may honour thee, both young and old.’"
6837,BOOK IX.,"Such were the words thine aged father spoke,"
6838,BOOK IX.,"Which thou hast now forgotten; yet, e’en now,"
6839,BOOK IX.,"Pause for awhile, and let thine anger cool;"
6840,BOOK IX.,"And noble gifts, so thou thy wrath remit,"
6841,BOOK IX.,From Agamemnon shalt thou bear away.
6842,BOOK IX.,"Listen to me, while I recount the gifts"
6843,BOOK IX.,Which in his tent he pledg’d him to bestow.
6844,BOOK IX.,"Sev’n tripods promis’d he, untouch’d by fire,"
6845,BOOK IX.,"Of gold, ten talents, twenty caldrons bright,"
6846,BOOK IX.,"Twelve pow’rful horses, in the course renown’d."
6847,BOOK IX.,Who by their speed have many prizes won.
6848,BOOK IX.,"Not empty-handed could that man be deem’d,"
6849,BOOK IX.,"Nor poor in gold, who but so much possess’d"
6850,BOOK IX.,As by those horses has for him been won.
6851,BOOK IX.,"Sev’n women too, well skill’d in household cares,"
6852,BOOK IX.,"Lesbians, whom he selected for himself,"
6853,BOOK IX.,"That day thou captur’dst Lesbos’ goodly isle,"
6854,BOOK IX.,In beauty far surpassing all their sex.
6855,BOOK IX.,These will he give; and with them will he send
6856,BOOK IX.,"The fair Briseis, her whom from thy tent"
6857,BOOK IX.,"He bore away; and add a solemn oath,"
6858,BOOK IX.,"He ne’er approach’d her bed, nor held with her"
6859,BOOK IX.,Such intercourse as man with woman holds.
6860,BOOK IX.,All these shall now be thine: but if the Gods
6861,BOOK IX.,"Shall grant us Priam’s city to destroy,"
6862,BOOK IX.,"Of gold and brass, when we divide the spoil,"
6863,BOOK IX.,"With countless heaps a vessel shalt thou freight,"
6864,BOOK IX.,"And twenty captives thou thyself shalt choose,"
6865,BOOK IX.,All only less than Argive Helen fair.
6866,BOOK IX.,And if it be our fate to see again
6867,BOOK IX.,"The teeming soil of Argos, thou mayst be"
6868,BOOK IX.,"His son by marriage, and in honour held"
6869,BOOK IX.,"As is Orestes, who, his only son,"
6870,BOOK IX.,"Is rear’d at home in luxury, and ease."
6871,BOOK IX.,"Three daughters fair are his, Chrysothemis,"
6872,BOOK IX.,"Iphianassa, and Laodice;"
6873,BOOK IX.,"Of these whiche’er thou wilt, to Peleus’ house,"
6874,BOOK IX.,"No portion ask’d for, thou shalt take to wife;"
6875,BOOK IX.,"And with her will he add such wedding gifts,"
6876,BOOK IX.,As never man before to daughter gave.
6877,BOOK IX.,"Sev’n prosp’rous towns besides; Cardamyle,"
6878,BOOK IX.,"And Enope, and Ira’s grassy plains,"
6879,BOOK IX.,"And Pherae, and Antheia’s pastures deep,"
6880,BOOK IX.,"Æpeia fair, and vine-clad Pedasus;"
6881,BOOK IX.,"All by the sea, by sandy Pylos’ bounds."
6882,BOOK IX.,"The dwellers there in flocks and herds are rich,"
6883,BOOK IX.,"And, as a God, will honour thee with gifts,"
6884,BOOK IX.,And to thy sceptre ample tribute pay.
6885,BOOK IX.,"All these he gives, so thou thy wrath remit."
6886,BOOK IX.,"But if thou hold Atrides in such hate,"
6887,BOOK IX.,"Him and his gifts, yet let thy pity rest"
6888,BOOK IX.,"On all the other Greeks, thus sore bested;"
6889,BOOK IX.,By whom thou shalt be honour’d as a God:
6890,BOOK IX.,For great the triumph that thou now mayst gain;
6891,BOOK IX.,E’en Hector’s self is now within thy reach;
6892,BOOK IX.,For he is near at hand; and in his pride
6893,BOOK IX.,"And martial fury deems that none, of all"
6894,BOOK IX.,"Our ships contain, can rival him in arms.”"
6895,BOOK IX.,
6896,BOOK IX.,"Whom answer’d thus Achilles, swift of foot:"
6897,BOOK IX.,"“Heav’n-born Ulysses, sage in council, son"
6898,BOOK IX.,"Of great Laertes, I must frankly speak"
6899,BOOK IX.,"My mind at once, my fix’d resolve declare:"
6900,BOOK IX.,"That from henceforth I may not by the Greeks,"
6901,BOOK IX.,"By this man and by that, be importun’d."
6902,BOOK IX.,"Him as the gates of hell my soul abhors,"
6903,BOOK IX.,"Whose outward words his secret thoughts belie,"
6904,BOOK IX.,Hear then what seems to me the wisest course.
6905,BOOK IX.,"On me nor Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,"
6906,BOOK IX.,"Nor others shall prevail, since nought is gain’d"
6907,BOOK IX.,By toil unceasing in the battle field.
6908,BOOK IX.,"Who nobly fight, but share with those who skulk;"
6909,BOOK IX.,Like honours gain the coward and the brave;
6910,BOOK IX.,Alike the idlers and the active die:
6911,BOOK IX.,"And nought it profits me, though day by day"
6912,BOOK IX.,In constant toil I set my life at stake;
6913,BOOK IX.,"But as a bird, though ill she fare herself,"
6914,BOOK IX.,"Brings to her callow brood the food she takes,"
6915,BOOK IX.,"So I through many a sleepless night have lain,"
6916,BOOK IX.,"And many a bloody day have labour’d through,"
6917,BOOK IX.,Engag’d in battle on your wives’ behalf.
6918,BOOK IX.,Twelve cities have I taken with my ships;
6919,BOOK IX.,"Eleven more by land, on Trojan soil:"
6920,BOOK IX.,From all of these abundant stores of wealth
6921,BOOK IX.,"I took, and all to Agamemnon gave;"
6922,BOOK IX.,"He, safe beside his ships, my spoils receiv’d,"
6923,BOOK IX.,"A few divided, but the most retain’d."
6924,BOOK IX.,To other chiefs and Kings he meted out
6925,BOOK IX.,"Their sev’ral portions, and they hold them still;"
6926,BOOK IX.,"From me, from me alone of all the Greeks,"
6927,BOOK IX.,"He bore away, and keeps my cherish’d wife;"
6928,BOOK IX.,"Well! let him keep her, solace of his bed!"
6929,BOOK IX.,"But say then, why do Greeks with Trojans fight?"
6930,BOOK IX.,Why hath Atrides brought this mighty host
6931,BOOK IX.,"To Troy, if not in fair-hair’d Helen’s cause?"
6932,BOOK IX.,"Of mortals are there none that love their wives,"
6933,BOOK IX.,"Save Atreus’ sons alone? or do not all,"
6934,BOOK IX.,"Who boast the praise of sense and virtue, love"
6935,BOOK IX.,And cherish each his own? as her I lov’d
6936,BOOK IX.,"E’en from my soul, though captive of my spear."
6937,BOOK IX.,"Now, since he once hath robb’d me, and deceiv’d,"
6938,BOOK IX.,"Let him not seek my aid; I know him now,"
6939,BOOK IX.,"And am not to be won; let him devise,"
6940,BOOK IX.,"With thee, Ulysses, and the other Kings,"
6941,BOOK IX.,How best from hostile fires to save his ships.
6942,BOOK IX.,He hath completed many mighty works
6943,BOOK IX.,"Without my aid; hath built a lofty wall,"
6944,BOOK IX.,"And dug a trench around it, wide and deep,"
6945,BOOK IX.,And in the trench hath fix’d a palisade;
6946,BOOK IX.,Nor so the warrior-slayer Hector’s might
6947,BOOK IX.,"Can keep in check; while I was in the field,"
6948,BOOK IX.,Not far without the walls would Hector range
6949,BOOK IX.,"His line of battle, nor beyond the Oak"
6950,BOOK IX.,And Scaean gates would venture; there indeed
6951,BOOK IX.,"He once presum’d to meet me, hand to hand,"
6952,BOOK IX.,And from my onset narrowly escap’d.
6953,BOOK IX.,"But as with Hector now no more I fight,"
6954,BOOK IX.,"To-morrow morn, my off’rings made to Jove,"
6955,BOOK IX.,"And all the Gods, and freighted well my ships,"
6956,BOOK IX.,"And launch’d upon the main, thyself shall see,"
6957,BOOK IX.,"If that thou care to see, my vessels spread"
6958,BOOK IX.,"O’er the broad bosom of the Hellespont,"
6959,BOOK IX.,My lusty crews plying the vig’rous oar;
6960,BOOK IX.,"And if th’ Earth-shaker send a fav’ring breeze,"
6961,BOOK IX.,Three days will bear us home to Phthia’s shore.
6962,BOOK IX.,"There did I leave abundant store of wealth,"
6963,BOOK IX.,When hitherward I took my luckless way;
6964,BOOK IX.,"Thither from hence I bear, of ruddy gold,"
6965,BOOK IX.,"And brass, and women fair, and iron hoar"
6966,BOOK IX.,The share assign’d me; but my chiefest prize
6967,BOOK IX.,"The monarch Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,"
6968,BOOK IX.,"Himself who gave, with insult takes away."
6969,BOOK IX.,"To him then speak aloud the words I send,"
6970,BOOK IX.,"That all may know his crimes, if yet he hope"
6971,BOOK IX.,"Some other Greek by treach’rous wiles to cheat,"
6972,BOOK IX.,"Cloth’d as he is in shamelessness! my glance,"
6973,BOOK IX.,"All brazen as he is, he dare not meet."
6974,BOOK IX.,"I share no more his counsels, nor his acts;"
6975,BOOK IX.,"He hath deceiv’d me once, and wrong’d; again"
6976,BOOK IX.,"He shall not cozen me! Of him, enough!"
6977,BOOK IX.,"I pass him by, whom Jove hath robb’d of sense."
6978,BOOK IX.,"His gifts I loathe, and spurn; himself I hold"
6979,BOOK IX.,At a hair’s worth; and would he proffer me
6980,BOOK IX.,"Tenfold or twentyfold of all he has,"
6981,BOOK IX.,Or ever may be his; or all the gold
6982,BOOK IX.,"Sent to Orchomenos or royal Thebes,"
6983,BOOK IX.,"Egyptian, treasurehouse of countless wealth,"
6984,BOOK IX.,"Who boasts her hundred gates, through each of which"
6985,BOOK IX.,With horse and car two hundred warriors march:
6986,BOOK IX.,"Nay, were his gifts in number as the sand,"
6987,BOOK IX.,"Or dust upon the plain, yet ne’er will I"
6988,BOOK IX.,"By Agamemnon be prevail’d upon,"
6989,BOOK IX.,Till I have paid him back my heart’s offence.
6990,BOOK IX.,"Nor e’er of Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,"
6991,BOOK IX.,Will I a daughter wed; not were she fair
6992,BOOK IX.,"As golden Venus, and in works renown’d"
6993,BOOK IX.,"As Pallas, blue-ey’d Maid, yet her e’en so"
6994,BOOK IX.,"I wed not; let him choose some other Greek,"
6995,BOOK IX.,"Some fitting match, of nobler blood than mine."
6996,BOOK IX.,"But should the Gods in safety bring me home,"
6997,BOOK IX.,At Peleus’ hands I may receive a wife;
6998,BOOK IX.,"And Greece can boast of many a lovely maid,"
6999,BOOK IX.,"In Hellas or in Phthia, daughters fair"
7000,BOOK IX.,Of chiefs who hold their native fortresses:
7001,BOOK IX.,"Of these, at will, a wife I may select:"
7002,BOOK IX.,And ofttimes hath my warlike soul inclin’d
7003,BOOK IX.,"To take a wedded wife, a fitting bride,"
7004,BOOK IX.,And aged Peleus’ wealth in peace enjoy.
7005,BOOK IX.,"For not the stores which Troy, they say, contain’d"
7006,BOOK IX.,"In peaceful times, ere came the sons of Greece,"
7007,BOOK IX.,"Nor all the treasures which Apollo’s shrine,"
7008,BOOK IX.,"The Archer-God, in rock-built Pythos holds,"
7009,BOOK IX.,May weigh with life; of oxen and of sheep
7010,BOOK IX.,Successful forays may good store provide;
7011,BOOK IX.,"And tripods may be gain’d, and noble steeds:"
7012,BOOK IX.,"But when the breath of man hath pass’d his lips,"
7013,BOOK IX.,Nor strength nor foray can the loss repair.
7014,BOOK IX.,"I by my Goddess-mother have been warn’d,"
7015,BOOK IX.,"The silver-footed Thetis, that o’er me"
7016,BOOK IX.,A double chance of destiny impends:
7017,BOOK IX.,"If here remaining, round the walls of Troy"
7018,BOOK IX.,"I wage the war, I ne’er shall see my home,"
7019,BOOK IX.,But then undying glory shall be mine:
7020,BOOK IX.,"If I return, and see my native land,"
7021,BOOK IX.,My glory all is gone; but length of life
7022,BOOK IX.,"Shall then be mine, and death be long deferr’d."
7023,BOOK IX.,"If others ask’d my counsel, I should say,"
7024,BOOK IX.,‘Homeward direct your course; of lofty Troy
7025,BOOK IX.,Ye see not yet the end; all-seeing Jove
7026,BOOK IX.,O’er her extends his hand; on him relying
7027,BOOK IX.,Her people all with confidence are fill’d.’
7028,BOOK IX.,Go then; my answer to the chiefs of Greece
7029,BOOK IX.,Speak boldly—such the privilege of age—
7030,BOOK IX.,Bid that some better counsel they devise
7031,BOOK IX.,"To save their ships and men; their present scheme,"
7032,BOOK IX.,"My anger unappeas’d, avails them nought."
7033,BOOK IX.,"But Phoenix here shall stay, and sleep to-night;"
7034,BOOK IX.,And with the morrow he with me shall sail
7035,BOOK IX.,"And seek our native land, if so he will:"
7036,BOOK IX.,For not by force will I remove him hence.”
7037,BOOK IX.,
7038,BOOK IX.,"He said; they all, confounded by his words,"
7039,BOOK IX.,In silence heard; so sternly did he speak.
7040,BOOK IX.,"At length, in tears, the aged Phoenix spoke,"
7041,BOOK IX.,For greatly fear’d he for the ships of Greece:
7042,BOOK IX.,"“If, great Achilles, on returning home"
7043,BOOK IX.,"Thy mind is set, nor canst thou be induc’d"
7044,BOOK IX.,"To save the ships from fire, so fierce thy wrath;"
7045,BOOK IX.,"How then, dear boy, can I remain behind,"
7046,BOOK IX.,"Alone? whom with thee aged Peleus sent,"
7047,BOOK IX.,That day when he in Agamemnon’s cause
7048,BOOK IX.,"From Phthia sent thee, inexperienc’d yet"
7049,BOOK IX.,"In all the duties of confed’rate war,"
7050,BOOK IX.,"And sage debate, on which attends renown."
7051,BOOK IX.,"Me then he sent, instructor of thy youth,"
7052,BOOK IX.,"To prompt thy language, and thine acts to guide."
7053,BOOK IX.,"So not from thee, dear boy, can I consent"
7054,BOOK IX.,"To part, though Heav’n should undertake my age"
7055,BOOK IX.,"To prompt thy language, and thine acts to guide."
7056,BOOK IX.,"So not from thee, dear boy, can I consent"
7057,BOOK IX.,"To part, though Heav’n should undertake my age"
7058,BOOK IX.,"To wipe away, and vig’rous youth restore,"
7059,BOOK IX.,"Such as I boasted, when from Greece I fled"
7060,BOOK IX.,"Before my angry sire, Amyntor, son"
7061,BOOK IX.,Of Ormenus; a fair-hair’d concubine
7062,BOOK IX.,"Cause of the quarrel; her my father lov’d,"
7063,BOOK IX.,"And by her love estrang’d, despis’d his wife,"
7064,BOOK IX.,"My mother; oft she pray’d me to seduce,"
7065,BOOK IX.,"To vex th’ old man, my father’s concubine;"
7066,BOOK IX.,"I yielded; he, suspecting, on my head"
7067,BOOK IX.,"A curse invok’d, and on the Furies call’d"
7068,BOOK IX.,"His curse to witness, that upon his knees"
7069,BOOK IX.,"No child, by me begotten, e’er should sit:"
7070,BOOK IX.,"His curse the Gods have heard, and ratified,"
7071,BOOK IX.,"Th’ infernal King, and awful Proserpine."
7072,BOOK IX.,"Then would I fain have slain him with the sword,"
7073,BOOK IX.,"Had not some God my rising fury quell’d,"
7074,BOOK IX.,"And set before my mind the public voice,"
7075,BOOK IX.,"The odium I should have to bear ’mid Greeks,"
7076,BOOK IX.,If branded with the name of patricide.
7077,BOOK IX.,But longer in my angry father’s house
7078,BOOK IX.,"To dwell, my spirit brook’d not, though my friends"
7079,BOOK IX.,And kinsmen all besought me to remain;
7080,BOOK IX.,"And many a goodly sheep, and many a steer"
7081,BOOK IX.,"They slew, and many swine, with fat o’erlaid,"
7082,BOOK IX.,"They sing’d, and roasted o’er the burning coals;"
7083,BOOK IX.,And drank in many a cup the old man’s wine.
7084,BOOK IX.,"Nine nights they kept me in continual watch,"
7085,BOOK IX.,By turns relieving guards. The fires meanwhile
7086,BOOK IX.,Burnt constant: one beneath the porch that fac’d
7087,BOOK IX.,The well-fenc’d court; one in the vestibule
7088,BOOK IX.,Before my chamber door. The tenth dark night
7089,BOOK IX.,"My chamber’s closely-fitting doors I broke,"
7090,BOOK IX.,"And lightly vaulted o’er the court-yard fence,"
7091,BOOK IX.,By guards alike and servant maids unmark’d.
7092,BOOK IX.,"Through all the breadth of Hellas then I fled,"
7093,BOOK IX.,"Until at length to Phthia’s fruitful soil,"
7094,BOOK IX.,"Mother of flocks, to Peleus’ realm I came,"
7095,BOOK IX.,"Who kindly welcom’d me, and with such love"
7096,BOOK IX.,"As to his only son, his well-belov’d,"
7097,BOOK IX.,"A father shows, his gen’rous gifts bestow’d."
7098,BOOK IX.,"He gave me wealth, he gave me ample rule;"
7099,BOOK IX.,"And on the bounds of Phthia bade me dwell,"
7100,BOOK IX.,And o’er the Dolopes hold sov’reign sway.
7101,BOOK IX.,"Thee too, Achilles, rival of the Gods,"
7102,BOOK IX.,"Such, as thou art I made thee; from my soul"
7103,BOOK IX.,I lov’d thee; nor wouldst thou with others go
7104,BOOK IX.,"Or to the meal, or in the house be fed,"
7105,BOOK IX.,"Till on my knee thou satt’st, and by my hand"
7106,BOOK IX.,"Thy food were cut, the cup were tender’d thee;"
7107,BOOK IX.,"And often, in thy childish helplessness."
7108,BOOK IX.,The bosom of my dress with wine was drench’d;
7109,BOOK IX.,"Such care I had of thee, such pains I took,"
7110,BOOK IX.,"Rememb’ring that by Heav’n’s decree, no son"
7111,BOOK IX.,"Of mine I e’er might see; then thee I made,"
7112,BOOK IX.,"Achilles, rival of the Gods, my son,"
7113,BOOK IX.,That thou mightst be the guardian of mine age.
7114,BOOK IX.,"But thou, Achilles, curb thy noble rage;"
7115,BOOK IX.,A heart implacable beseems thee not.
7116,BOOK IX.,"The Gods themselves, in virtue, honour, strength,"
7117,BOOK IX.,"Excelling thee, may yet be mollified;"
7118,BOOK IX.,"For they, when mortals have transgress’d, or fail’d"
7119,BOOK IX.,"To do aright, by sacrifice and pray’r,"
7120,BOOK IX.,"Libations and burnt-off’rings, may be sooth’d."
7121,BOOK IX.,Pray’rs are the daughters of immortal Jove;
7122,BOOK IX.,"But halt, and wrinkled, and of feeble sight,"
7123,BOOK IX.,"They plod in Ate’s track; while Ate, strong"
7124,BOOK IX.,"And swift of foot, outstrips their laggard pace,"
7125,BOOK IX.,"And, dealing woe to man, o’er all the earth"
7126,BOOK IX.,"Before them flies: they, following, heal her wounds."
7127,BOOK IX.,"Him who with honour welcomes their approach,"

7129,BOOK IX.,"But who rejects, and sternly casts them off,"
7130,BOOK IX.,"To Saturn’s son they go, and make their pray’r"
7131,BOOK IX.,That Ate follow him and claim her dues.
7132,BOOK IX.,"Then to the daughters of immortal Jove,"
7133,BOOK IX.,"Do thou, Achilles, show the like respect,"
7134,BOOK IX.,That many another brave man’s heart hath sway’d.
7135,BOOK IX.,"If to thy tent no gifts Atrides brought,"
7136,BOOK IX.,"With promises of more, but still retain’d"
7137,BOOK IX.,"His vehement enmity, I could not ask"
7138,BOOK IX.,"That thou thy cherish’d anger shouldst discard,"
7139,BOOK IX.,"And aid the Greeks, how great so-e’er their need."
7140,BOOK IX.,"But now large off’rings hath he giv’n, and more"
7141,BOOK IX.,"Hath promis’d; and, of all the Greeks, hath sent"
7142,BOOK IX.,"To pray thine aid, the men thou lov’st the best."
7143,BOOK IX.,"Discredit not their mission, nor their words."
7144,BOOK IX.,"Till now, I grant thee, none could blame thy wrath."
7145,BOOK IX.,"In praise of men in ancient days renown’d,"
7146,BOOK IX.,"This have we heard, that how-so-e’er might rage"
7147,BOOK IX.,"Their hostile feuds, their anger might be still"
7148,BOOK IX.,"By gifts averted, and by words appeas’d."
7149,BOOK IX.,"One case I bear in mind, in times long past,"
7150,BOOK IX.,"And not in later days; and here, ’mid friends,"
7151,BOOK IX.,"How all occurr’d, will I at length recite."
7152,BOOK IX.,"Time was, that with Ætolia’s warlike bands"
7153,BOOK IX.,Round Calydon the Acarnanians fought
7154,BOOK IX.,"With mutual slaughter; these to save the town,"
7155,BOOK IX.,The Acarnanians burning to destroy.
7156,BOOK IX.,This curse of war the golden-throned Queen
7157,BOOK IX.,"Diana sent, in anger that from her"
7158,BOOK IX.,Œneus the first-fruits of his field withheld.
7159,BOOK IX.,The other Gods their hecatombs receiv’d;
7160,BOOK IX.,"Diana’s shrine alone no off’rings deck’d,"
7161,BOOK IX.,"Neglected, or o’erlook’d; the sin was great;"
7162,BOOK IX.,And in her wrath the arrow-darting Queen
7163,BOOK IX.,"A savage wild-boar sent, with gleaming tusks,"
7164,BOOK IX.,"Which Œneus’ vineyard haunting, wrought him harm."
7165,BOOK IX.,"There laid he prostrate many a stately tree,"
7166,BOOK IX.,"With root and branch, with blossom and with fruit."
7167,BOOK IX.,"Him Meleager, son of Œneus, slew,"
7168,BOOK IX.,With youths and dogs from all the neighbouring towns
7169,BOOK IX.,"Collected; smaller force had not avail’d,"
7170,BOOK IX.,"So huge he was, so fierce; and many a youth"
7171,BOOK IX.,Had by his tusks been laid upon the bier.
7172,BOOK IX.,"A fierce contention then the Goddess rais’d,"
7173,BOOK IX.,"For the boar’s head and bristly hide, between"
7174,BOOK IX.,The Acarnanian and th’ Ætolian bands.
7175,BOOK IX.,"While warlike Meleager kept the field,"
7176,BOOK IX.,So long the Acarnanians far’d but ill;
7177,BOOK IX.,"Nor dar’d, despite the numbers of their host,"
7178,BOOK IX.,Maintain their ground before the city walls.
7179,BOOK IX.,"When he to anger yielded, which sometimes"
7180,BOOK IX.,"Swells in the bosom e’en of wisest men,"
7181,BOOK IX.,"Incens’d against his mother, he withdrew"
7182,BOOK IX.,"To Cleopatra fair, his wedded wife;"
7183,BOOK IX.,"(Marpessa her, Evenus’ daughter, bore"
7184,BOOK IX.,"To Idas, strongest man of all who then"
7185,BOOK IX.,"Were living, who against Apollo’s self"
7186,BOOK IX.,For the neat-footed maiden bent his bow.
7187,BOOK IX.,"Her parents call’d the child Alcyone,"
7188,BOOK IX.,"In mem’ry of the tears her mother shed,"
7189,BOOK IX.,"Rival of Alcyon’s melancholy fate,"
7190,BOOK IX.,When by far-darting Phoebus forc’d away).
7191,BOOK IX.,"With her, retiring from the field, he nurs’d"
7192,BOOK IX.,"His wrath; resenting thus his mother’s curse,"
7193,BOOK IX.,"Althaea; she her brother’s death bore hard,"
7194,BOOK IX.,"And pray’d to Heav’n above, and with her hands"
7195,BOOK IX.,"Beating the solid earth, the nether pow’rs,"
7196,BOOK IX.,"Pluto and awful Proserpine, implor’d,"
7197,BOOK IX.,"Down on her knees, her bosom wet with tears,"
7198,BOOK IX.,Death on her son invoking; from the depths
7199,BOOK IX.,"Of Erebus Erinnys heard her pray’r,"
7200,BOOK IX.,"Gloom-haunting Goddess, dark and stern of heart."
7201,BOOK IX.,"Soon round the gates the din of battle rose,"
7202,BOOK IX.,The tow’rs by storm assaulted; then his aid
7203,BOOK IX.,Th’ Ætonian Elders and the sacred priests
7204,BOOK IX.,With promises of great reward implor’d.
7205,BOOK IX.,"A fruitful plot they bade him set apart,"
7206,BOOK IX.,"The richest land in lovely Calydon,"
7207,BOOK IX.,"Of fifty acres: half for vineyard meet,"
7208,BOOK IX.,"And half of fertile plain, for tillage clear’d."
7209,BOOK IX.,Upon the threshold of his lofty rooms
7210,BOOK IX.,"Old Œneus stood, and at the portals clos’d"
7211,BOOK IX.,"He knock’d in vain, a suppliant to his son."
7212,BOOK IX.,"His sisters and his brother join’d their pray’rs,"
7213,BOOK IX.,But sterner his rejection of their suit;
7214,BOOK IX.,"The friends he valued most, and lov’d the best,"
7215,BOOK IX.,Yet they too fail’d his fix’d resolve to shake;
7216,BOOK IX.,"Till to his very doors the war had reach’d,"
7217,BOOK IX.,"The foe upon the tow’rs, the town in flames:"
7218,BOOK IX.,"Then Meleager’s beauteous wife, at length,"
7219,BOOK IX.,"In tears, beseeching him, the thousand ills"
7220,BOOK IX.,"Recall’d, which on a captur’d town attend;"
7221,BOOK IX.,"The slaughter’d men, the city burnt with fire,"
7222,BOOK IX.,The helpless children and deep-bosom’d dames
7223,BOOK IX.,"A prey to strangers. List’ning to the tale,"
7224,BOOK IX.,His spirit was rous’d within him; and again
7225,BOOK IX.,"He took the field, and donn’d his glitt’ring arms."
7226,BOOK IX.,Thus did his act from doom th’ Ætolians save
7227,BOOK IX.,"Spontaneous; yet he gain’d not, though he sav’d,"
7228,BOOK IX.,The rich reward they once were pledg’d to give.
7229,BOOK IX.,"But be not thou like him, nor let thy God"
7230,BOOK IX.,"Turn thitherward thy thoughts; our ships on fire,"
7231,BOOK IX.,"Thine aid will less be priz’d; come, take the gifts,"
7232,BOOK IX.,And as a God be honour’d by the Greeks.
7233,BOOK IX.,"If thou hereafter, unsolicited,"
7234,BOOK IX.,"The battle join, the Greeks thou mayst protect,"
7235,BOOK IX.,But not an equal share of honour gain.”
7236,BOOK IX.,
7237,BOOK IX.,"Whom answer’d thus Achilles, swift of foot:"
7238,BOOK IX.,"“Phoenix, my second father, rev’rend sire,"
7239,BOOK IX.,Such honours move me not; my honour comes
7240,BOOK IX.,"From Jove, whose will it is that I should here"
7241,BOOK IX.,"Remain beside the ships, while I retain"
7242,BOOK IX.,Breath in my lungs and vigour in my limbs.
7243,BOOK IX.,"This too I say, and bear it in thy mind:"
7244,BOOK IX.,"Disturb me not with weeping and complaints,"
7245,BOOK IX.,"To do Atrides grace; if him thou love,"
7246,BOOK IX.,My love for thee perchance may turn to hate:
7247,BOOK IX.,My friend should honour him who honours me.
7248,BOOK IX.,"But come with me, and of my kingdom half,"
7249,BOOK IX.,And equal honours shalt thou share with me.
7250,BOOK IX.,"These shall our message bear; stay thou the while,"
7251,BOOK IX.,And on soft couch repose; to-morrow morn
7252,BOOK IX.,Will we determine or to sail or stay.”
7253,BOOK IX.,
7254,BOOK IX.,"He said, and with his eyebrows gave a sign"
7255,BOOK IX.,"In silence to Patroclus, to prepare"
7256,BOOK IX.,"A bed for Phoenix, that without delay"
7257,BOOK IX.,The rest might leave the tent; then thus began
7258,BOOK IX.,"Ajax, the godlike son of Telamon:"
7259,BOOK IX.,"“Ulysses sage, Laertes’ high-born son,"
7260,BOOK IX.,Depart we now; for this way our discourse
7261,BOOK IX.,Can lead to no result; behoves us bear
7262,BOOK IX.,"Our tidings, all unwelcome as they are,"
7263,BOOK IX.,Back to the chiefs awaiting our return.
7264,BOOK IX.,Achilles hath allow’d his noble heart
7265,BOOK IX.,To cherish rancour and malignant hate;
7266,BOOK IX.,"Nor reeks he of his old companions’ love,"
7267,BOOK IX.,Wherewith we honour’d him above the rest.
7268,BOOK IX.,"Relentless he! a son’s or brother’s death,"
7269,BOOK IX.,"By payment of a fine, may be aton’d;"
7270,BOOK IX.,"The slayer may remain in peace at home,"
7271,BOOK IX.,"The debt discharg’d; the other will forego,"
7272,BOOK IX.,"The forfeiture receiv’d, his just revenge;"
7273,BOOK IX.,"But thou maintain’st a stern, obdurate mood."
7274,BOOK IX.,"And for a single girl! we offer sev’n,"
7275,BOOK IX.,"Surpassing fair, and other gifts to boot."
7276,BOOK IX.,We now bespeak thy courtesy; respect
7277,BOOK IX.,Thy hearth; remember that beneath thy roof
7278,BOOK IX.,"We stand, deputed by the gen’ral voice"
7279,BOOK IX.,"Of all the host; and fain would claim to be,"
7280,BOOK IX.,"Of all the Greeks, thy best and dearest friends.”"
7281,BOOK IX.,
7282,BOOK IX.,"Whom answer’d thus Achilles, swift of foot:"
7283,BOOK IX.,"“Illustrious Ajax, son of Telamon,"
7284,BOOK IX.,Without offence hast thou thy message giv’n;
7285,BOOK IX.,"But fury fills my soul, whene’er I think"
7286,BOOK IX.,"How Agamemnon, ’mid th’ assembled Greeks,"
7287,BOOK IX.,"Insulting, held me forth to public scorn,"
7288,BOOK IX.,"As some dishonour’d, houseless vagabond."
7289,BOOK IX.,"But go ye now, and bear my answer back:"
7290,BOOK IX.,"No more in bloody war will I engage,"
7291,BOOK IX.,"Till noble Hector, Priam’s godlike son,"
7292,BOOK IX.,"O’er slaughter’d Greeks, your ships enwrapp’d in fire,"
7293,BOOK IX.,Shall reach the quarters of the Myrmidons.
7294,BOOK IX.,"Ere he assail my ship and tents, I think"
7295,BOOK IX.,"That Hector, valiant as he is, will pause.”"
7296,BOOK IX.,"Thus he: they each the double goblet rais’d,"
7297,BOOK IX.,"And, to the Gods their due libations pour’d,"
7298,BOOK IX.,"Ulysses leading, to the ships return’d."
7299,BOOK IX.,
7300,BOOK IX.,Meanwhile Patroclus bade th’ attendant maids
7301,BOOK IX.,"Prepare a bed for Phoenix; they obey’d,"
7302,BOOK IX.,"And quickly laid the bed with fleeces warm,"
7303,BOOK IX.,"And rugs, and linen light and fine o’erspread."
7304,BOOK IX.,"There slept th’ old man, and waited for the morn."
7305,BOOK IX.,Within the tent’s recess Achilles slept;
7306,BOOK IX.,"And by his side, from Lesbos captive brought,"
7307,BOOK IX.,"Daughter of Phorbas, Diomede fair;"
7308,BOOK IX.,On th’ other side Patroclus lay; with him
7309,BOOK IX.,"The graceful Iphis, whom, when Scyros’ isle"
7310,BOOK IX.,"He captur’d, and Enyes’ rock-built fort,"
7311,BOOK IX.,Achilles to his lov’d companion gave.
7312,BOOK IX.,
7313,BOOK IX.,"When to Atrides’ tent the envoys came,"
7314,BOOK IX.,"The chiefs, uprising, pledg’d them one by one"
7315,BOOK IX.,In golden goblets; then their tidings ask’d.
7316,BOOK IX.,"First Agamemnon, King of men, enquir’d:"
7317,BOOK IX.,"“Tell me, renown’d Ulysses, pride of Greece,"
7318,BOOK IX.,"What says he: will he save our ships from fire,"
7319,BOOK IX.,"Or still, in wrathful mood, withhold his aid?”"
7320,BOOK IX.,
7321,BOOK IX.,"To whom again Ulysses, stout of heart:"
7322,BOOK IX.,"“Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
7323,BOOK IX.,"His anger is not quench’d, but fiercer still"
7324,BOOK IX.,It glows; thy gifts and thee alike he spurns;
7325,BOOK IX.,He bids thee with the other chiefs concert
7326,BOOK IX.,The means thy people and thy ships to save;
7327,BOOK IX.,And menaces himself at early dawn
7328,BOOK IX.,To launch his well-trimm’d vessels on the main.
7329,BOOK IX.,"Nay more, he counsels others, so he says,"
7330,BOOK IX.,"Homeward to turn, since here of lofty Troy"
7331,BOOK IX.,We see not yet the end; all-seeing Jove
7332,BOOK IX.,"O’er her extends his hand; on him relying,"
7333,BOOK IX.,Her people all with confidence are fill’d.
7334,BOOK IX.,Such was his language; here before you stand
7335,BOOK IX.,"Ajax and both the heralds, sage, grave men,"
7336,BOOK IX.,"Who with me went, and will confirm my words."
7337,BOOK IX.,"Old Phoenix left we there, so will’d the chief,"
7338,BOOK IX.,"That with the morrow he with him may sail,"
7339,BOOK IX.,"And seek their native land, if so he will;"
7340,BOOK IX.,For not by force will he remove him hence.”
7341,BOOK IX.,
7342,BOOK IX.,"Ulysses thus; they all in silence heard,"
7343,BOOK IX.,"Amaz’d, so stern the message that he bore."
7344,BOOK IX.,Long time in silence sat the chiefs of Greece.
7345,BOOK IX.,Outspoke at length the valiant Diomed:
7346,BOOK IX.,"“Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
7347,BOOK IX.,Would that thou ne’er hadst stoop’d with costly gifts
7348,BOOK IX.,To sue for aid from Peleus’ matchless son;
7349,BOOK IX.,"For he before was over-proud, and now"
7350,BOOK IX.,Thine offers will have tenfold swoll’n his pride.
7351,BOOK IX.,"But leave we him, according to his will,"
7352,BOOK IX.,"To go or stay: he then will join the fight,"
7353,BOOK IX.,"When his own spirit shall prompt, or Heav’n inspire."
7354,BOOK IX.,"But hear ye all, and do as I advise:"
7355,BOOK IX.,Refresh’d with food and wine (for therein lie
7356,BOOK IX.,"Both strength and courage), turn we to our rest;"
7357,BOOK IX.,"And when the rosy-finger’d morn appears,"
7358,BOOK IX.,"Thyself among the foremost, with bold hearts,"
7359,BOOK IX.,Before our ships both horse and foot array.”
7360,BOOK IX.,
7361,BOOK IX.,He said; and all the chiefs with loud applause
7362,BOOK IX.,"His speech confirm’d; then, due libations pour’d,"
7363,BOOK IX.,Each to his sev’ral tent they all withdrew;
7364,BOOK IX.,"Then laid them down, and sought the boon of sleep."

7393,BOOK X.,In night-long slumbers lay the other chiefs
7394,BOOK X.,"Of all the Greeks, by gentle sleep subdued;"
7395,BOOK X.,"But not on Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,"
7396,BOOK X.,"By various cares oppress’d, sweet slumber fell."
7397,BOOK X.,"As when from Jove, the fair-hair’d Juno’s Lord,"
7398,BOOK X.,"Flashes the lightning, bringing in its train"
7399,BOOK X.,Tempestuous storm of mingled rain and hail
7400,BOOK X.,"Or snow, by winter sprinkled o’er the fields;"
7401,BOOK X.,Or op’ning wide the rav’nous jaws of war;
7402,BOOK X.,So Agamemnon from his inmost heart
7403,BOOK X.,"Pour’d forth in groans his multitudinous grief,"
7404,BOOK X.,His spirit within him sinking. On the plain
7405,BOOK X.,"He look’d, and there, alarm’d, the watchfires saw,"
7406,BOOK X.,"Which, far advanc’d before the walls of Troy,"
7407,BOOK X.,Blaz’d numberless; and thence of pipes and flutes
7408,BOOK X.,"He heard the sound, and busy hum of men."
7409,BOOK X.,"Upon the ships he look’d, and men of Greece,"
7410,BOOK X.,And by the roots his hair in handfuls tore
7411,BOOK X.,To Jove on high; deep groan’d his mighty heart.
7412,BOOK X.,"Thus as he mus’d, the wisest course appear’d,"
7413,BOOK X.,"With Nestor, son of Neleus, to confer,"
7414,BOOK X.,If they some scheme in council might devise
7415,BOOK X.,To ward destruction from the Grecian host.
7416,BOOK X.,"He rose, and o’er his body drew his vest,"
7417,BOOK X.,And underneath his well-turn’d feet he bound
7418,BOOK X.,"His sandals fair; then o’er his shoulders threw,"
7419,BOOK X.,"Down reaching to his feet, a lion’s skin,"
7420,BOOK X.,Tawny and vast; then grasp’d his pond’rous spear.
7421,BOOK X.,
7422,BOOK X.,On Menelaus weigh’d an equal dread;
7423,BOOK X.,"Nor on his eyes that night had slumber sat,"
7424,BOOK X.,"Lest ill befall the Greeks; who, in his cause,"
7425,BOOK X.,"Crossing the wat’ry waste, had come to Troy,"
7426,BOOK X.,And bold defiance to the Trojans giv’n.
7427,BOOK X.,Round his broad chest a panther’s skin he threw;
7428,BOOK X.,"Then on his head his brazen helmet plac’d,"
7429,BOOK X.,And in his brawny hand a lance he bore.
7430,BOOK X.,"To meet his brother went he forth, of Greece"
7431,BOOK X.,"The mighty monarch, as a God rever’d."
7432,BOOK X.,"Him by the ship he found, in act to arm;"
7433,BOOK X.,And welcome was his presence to the King.
7434,BOOK X.,
7435,BOOK X.,Then valiant Menelaus first began:
7436,BOOK X.,"“Why thus in arms, good brother? seek’st thou one"
7437,BOOK X.,The Trojan camp to spy? I greatly fear
7438,BOOK X.,"That none will undertake the task, alone"
7439,BOOK X.,To spy the movements of the hostile camp
7440,BOOK X.,In the dark night: stout-hearted he must be.”
7441,BOOK X.,
7442,BOOK X.,To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus:
7443,BOOK X.,"“Great need, my noble brother, have we both"
7444,BOOK X.,"Of sagest counsels, if we hope the Greeks"
7445,BOOK X.,"And Grecian ships from ruin to preserve,"
7446,BOOK X.,Since turn’d against us is the mind of Jove.
7447,BOOK X.,To Hector’s off’rings most his soul inclines;
7448,BOOK X.,"For never have I seen, or heard men tell,"
7449,BOOK X.,How in one day one man has wrought such loss
7450,BOOK X.,"As Hector, dear to Jove, yet not the son"
7451,BOOK X.,"Of God or Goddess, on the Greeks has wrought."
7452,BOOK X.,"Such deeds hath he achiev’d, such havoc made,"
7453,BOOK X.,As we shall long in bitter mem’ry keep.
7454,BOOK X.,"Haste thou amid the ships, and hither bring"

7461,BOOK X.,To them by pref’rence hath this charge been giv’n.”
7462,BOOK X.,
7463,BOOK X.,He said: and Menelaus answer’d thus:
7464,BOOK X.,“What wouldst thou have me do then? here remain
7465,BOOK X.,"With them, and wait thy coming, or to them"
7466,BOOK X.,"Thy message give, and follow in thy steps?”"
7467,BOOK X.,
7468,BOOK X.,"Him answer’d Agamemnon, King of men:"
7469,BOOK X.,"“Remain thou here, lest haply we might fail"
7470,BOOK X.,To meet; for in the camp are many paths.
7471,BOOK X.,"But thou, where’er thou go’st, each sev’ral man"
7472,BOOK X.,"Address, and ask to rise; to each his name"
7473,BOOK X.,And patronymic giving; pay to each
7474,BOOK X.,All due respect; nor bear thee haughtily;
7475,BOOK X.,We like the rest must share the load of toil.
7476,BOOK X.,Which Jove assigns to all of mortal birth.”
7477,BOOK X.,
7478,BOOK X.,"His brother thus with counsels wise dismiss’d,"
7479,BOOK X.,The King to aged Nestor took his way:
7480,BOOK X.,Him by his tent and dark-ribb’d ship he found
7481,BOOK X.,"On a soft couch; beside him lay his arms,"
7482,BOOK X.,"His shield, two lances, and a glitt’ring helm:"
7483,BOOK X.,"There lay the rich-wrought belt the old man wore,"
7484,BOOK X.,"When to the battle, arm’d, he led his troops;"
7485,BOOK X.,For nought to age’s weakness would he yield.
7486,BOOK X.,"Raising his head, and on his elbow propp’d,"
7487,BOOK X.,"He question’d thus Atrides: “Who art thou,"
7488,BOOK X.,"That wand’rest through th’ encampment thus alone,"
7489,BOOK X.,"In the dark night, when other mortals sleep?"
7490,BOOK X.,"Seek’st thou some mule broke loose, or comrade lost?"
7491,BOOK X.,"Speak, nor in silence come; what wouldst thou here?”"
7492,BOOK X.,
7493,BOOK X.,"To whom thus Agamemnon, King of men:"
7494,BOOK X.,"“O Nestor! son of Neleus, pride of Greece,"
7495,BOOK X.,"Know me for Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,"
7496,BOOK X.,"On whom hath Jove, beyond the lot of men,"
7497,BOOK X.,"Laid grief that ne’er shall end, while I retain"
7498,BOOK X.,"Breath in my lungs, and vigour in my limbs."
7499,BOOK X.,"I wander thus, because these eyes of mine"
7500,BOOK X.,"Sweet slumber visits not, by cares of war"
7501,BOOK X.,"Oppress’d, and harass’d by the woes of Greece."
7502,BOOK X.,Much for the Greeks I fear; nor keeps my mind
7503,BOOK X.,Its wonted firmess; I am ill at ease;
7504,BOOK X.,And leaps my troubled heart as tho’ ’twould burst
7505,BOOK X.,My bosom’s bounds; my limbs beneath me shake.
7506,BOOK X.,"But if thou wilt, since thou too know’st not sleep,"
7507,BOOK X.,"Together to the outposts let us go,"
7508,BOOK X.,"And see if there, by toil and sleep o’erpow’r’d,"
7509,BOOK X.,"The guard repose, neglectful of their watch."
7510,BOOK X.,The foe is close at hand; nor are we sure
7511,BOOK X.,He may not hazard e’en a night attack.”
7512,BOOK X.,
7513,BOOK X.,To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied;
7514,BOOK X.,"“Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
7515,BOOK X.,Not all the hopes that Hector entertains
7516,BOOK X.,Shall by the Lord of counsel be fulfill’d;
7517,BOOK X.,"For him are toil and danger yet in store,"
7518,BOOK X.,If but Achilles of his wrath repent.
7519,BOOK X.,"Gladly will I attend thee; others too,"
7520,BOOK X.,"Tydides, spearman bold, Ulysses sage,"
7521,BOOK X.,"Ajax the swift, and Phyleus’ noble son,"
7522,BOOK X.,Should all be summon’d; and ’twere well that one
7523,BOOK X.,"Across the camp should run, to call in haste"
7524,BOOK X.,"The godlike Ajax, and Idomeneus;"
7525,BOOK X.,"Theirs are the farthest ships, nor near at hand."
7526,BOOK X.,"But, dear to me as Menelaus is,"
7527,BOOK X.,"And highly honour’d, I must blame, that thus"
7528,BOOK X.,"(Though thou shouldst take offence, I needs must say)"
7529,BOOK X.,"He sleeps, and leaves the toil to thee alone."
7530,BOOK X.,"With all the chiefs he should be busied now,"
7531,BOOK X.,"Imploring aid, in this our utmost need.”"
7532,BOOK X.,
7533,BOOK X.,"To whom thus Agamemnon, King of men:"
7534,BOOK X.,"“For other times, old man, reserve thy blame;"
7535,BOOK X.,"Sometimes, I own, he lags behind, nor takes"
7536,BOOK X.,"His share of labour; not from indolence,"
7537,BOOK X.,Or want of sense; but still regarding me;
7538,BOOK X.,Waiting from me an impulse to receive.
7539,BOOK X.,"But now, before me he was up, and came"
7540,BOOK X.,To visit me; and I have sent him on
7541,BOOK X.,To call those very men whom thou hast nam’d.
7542,BOOK X.,"Come then; for we, beside the gates, and guard"
7543,BOOK X.,Shall find them; there my orders were to meet.”
7544,BOOK X.,
7545,BOOK X.,To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied;
7546,BOOK X.,“Then none can blame him; nor can any Greek
7547,BOOK X.,Justly refuse his summons to obey.”
7548,BOOK X.,
7549,BOOK X.,"He said, and round his body wrapped his vest;"
7550,BOOK X.,"Then on his feet his sandals fair he bound,"
7551,BOOK X.,"And o’er his shoulders clasp’d a purple cloak,"
7552,BOOK X.,"Doubled, with ample folds, and downy pile;"
7553,BOOK X.,"Then took his spear, with point of sharpen’d brass,"
7554,BOOK X.,And through the camp prepar’d to take his way.
7555,BOOK X.,Gerenian Nestor from his slumbers first
7556,BOOK X.,"Ulysses, sage as Jove in council, rous’d,"
7557,BOOK X.,Loud shouting; soon the voice his senses reach’d;
7558,BOOK X.,"Forth from his tent he came, and thus he spoke:"
7559,BOOK X.,"“What cause so urgent leads you, through the camp,"
7560,BOOK X.,In the dark night to wander thus alone?”
7561,BOOK X.,
7562,BOOK X.,To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
7563,BOOK X.,"“Ulysses sage, Laertes’ godlike son,"
7564,BOOK X.,Be not offended; such the stress that now
7565,BOOK X.,"Weighs down our army; come thou then with us,"
7566,BOOK X.,And others let us call; with whom ’tis meet
7567,BOOK X.,"That we should counsel take, to fight or fly.”"
7568,BOOK X.,
7569,BOOK X.,He said; Ulysses to the tent return’d;
7570,BOOK X.,"Then, his broad shield across his shoulders thrown,"
7571,BOOK X.,"Came forth again, and with them took his way."
7572,BOOK X.,"To Diomed, the son of Tydeus, next"
7573,BOOK X.,"They went; and him they found beside his arms,"
7574,BOOK X.,"Without his tent; his comrades slept around,"
7575,BOOK X.,Their heads upon their bucklers laid; their spears
7576,BOOK X.,"Stood upright, on the butts; the burnish’d brass"
7577,BOOK X.,"Like Heav’n’s own lightning, flashing far around."
7578,BOOK X.,"Stretch’d on a wild bull’s hide the chief repos’d,"
7579,BOOK X.,A gay-wrought carpet roll’d beneath his head.
7580,BOOK X.,"Gerenian Nestor close behind him stood,"
7581,BOOK X.,"And touched him with his foot, and thus in tone"
7582,BOOK X.,"Reproachful spoke: “Arouse thee, Tydeus’ son!"
7583,BOOK X.,Why sleep’st thou thus all night? or know’st thou not
7584,BOOK X.,"That on the very margin of the plain,"
7585,BOOK X.,"And close beside the ships the Trojans lie,"
7586,BOOK X.,And little space between the camps is left?”
7587,BOOK X.,
7588,BOOK X.,"Quick rous’d from sleep, thus answer’d Diomed:"
7589,BOOK X.,"“Beshrew thy heart, old man! no labour seems"
7590,BOOK X.,For thee too hard; are there not younger men
7591,BOOK X.,"To run about the camp, and summon all"
7592,BOOK X.,"The sev’ral chiefs? thou dost too much, old man.”"
7593,BOOK X.,
7594,BOOK X.,To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
7595,BOOK X.,"“True, friend, and full of wisdom are thy words;"
7596,BOOK X.,"Good sons indeed I have, and followers brave"
7597,BOOK X.,"And many, who might well my message bear;"
7598,BOOK X.,But great is now the stress that lies on Greece;
7599,BOOK X.,"For on a razor’s edge is balanc’d now,"
7600,BOOK X.,"To all the Greeks, the chance of life or death."
7601,BOOK X.,"Do thou then go (for thou my younger art),"
7602,BOOK X.,"And if thou pity me, thyself arouse"
7603,BOOK X.,"Ajax the swift, and Phyleus’ noble son.”"
7604,BOOK X.,"He said; the warrior round his shoulders threw,"
7605,BOOK X.,"Down reaching to his feet, a lion’s hide,"
7606,BOOK X.,Tawny and dark; and took his pond’rous spear.
7607,BOOK X.,"He went, arous’d, and with him brought the chiefs."
7608,BOOK X.,
7609,BOOK X.,"When to the guard they came, not sunk in sleep"
7610,BOOK X.,Found they the leaders; but on wakeful watch
7611,BOOK X.,"Intent, and all alert beside their arms."
7612,BOOK X.,As round a sheepfold keep their anxious watch
7613,BOOK X.,"The dogs, who in the neighbouring thicket hear"
7614,BOOK X.,"Some beast, that, bold in search of prey, has come"
7615,BOOK X.,Down from the mountain; loud the clamours rise
7616,BOOK X.,Of men and dogs; all sleep is banish’d thence;
7617,BOOK X.,"So from their eyes was banish’d sleep, who watch’d"
7618,BOOK X.,Through that disastrous night; still plainward turning
7619,BOOK X.,At ev’ry movement in the Trojan camp.
7620,BOOK X.,"The old man saw, well-pleas’d; and thus address’d"
7621,BOOK X.,With cheering words the captains of the guard:
7622,BOOK X.,"“Watch ever thus, good youths; nor be surpris’d"
7623,BOOK X.,"By slumber, lest the foe a triumph gain.”"
7624,BOOK X.,
7625,BOOK X.,"This said, he cross’d the ditch, and with him went"
7626,BOOK X.,"The Grecian leaders, to the council call’d:"
7627,BOOK X.,"With them, admitted to the conf’rence, went"
7628,BOOK X.,"Meriones, and Nestor’s noble son."
7629,BOOK X.,"The deep-dug ditch they cross’d, and sat them down"
7630,BOOK X.,"Upon an open space, from corpses clear;"
7631,BOOK X.,Where Hector from the slaughter of the Greeks
7632,BOOK X.,"Turn’d back, when Ev’ning spread her veil around:"
7633,BOOK X.,"There sat they down, and there the conf’rence held."
7634,BOOK X.,Gerenian Nestor first took up the word:
7635,BOOK X.,“O friends! is any here with heart so bold
7636,BOOK X.,"Who dares, self-confident, the Trojan camp"
7637,BOOK X.,"To enter? there some straggler he might take,"
7638,BOOK X.,"Or in the camp itself some tidings gain,"
7639,BOOK X.,What are their secret counsels; if they mean
7640,BOOK X.,"Here by the ships to hold their ground, or back,"
7641,BOOK X.,"Sated with vict’ry, to the town retire."
7642,BOOK X.,"This could he learn, and hither scatheless bring"
7643,BOOK X.,"His tidings, high as Heav’n in all men’s mouths"
7644,BOOK X.,"Would be his praise, and ample his reward."
7645,BOOK X.,For ev’ry captain of a ship should give
7646,BOOK X.,"A coal-black ewe, and at her foot a lamb,"
7647,BOOK X.,A prize beyond compare; and high should be
7648,BOOK X.,His place at banquets and at solemn feasts.”
7649,BOOK X.,
7650,BOOK X.,He said; but all the chiefs in silence heard;
7651,BOOK X.,"Then rose the valiant Diomed, and said:"
7652,BOOK X.,"“Nestor, that heart is mine; I dare alone"
7653,BOOK X.,"Enter the hostile camp, so close at hand;"
7654,BOOK X.,"Yet were one comrade giv’n me, I should go"
7655,BOOK X.,"With more of comfort, more of confidence."
7656,BOOK X.,"Where two combine, one before other sees"
7657,BOOK X.,The better course; and ev’n though one alone
7658,BOOK X.,"The readiest way discover, yet would be"
7659,BOOK X.,"His judgment slower, his decision less.”"
7660,BOOK X.,
7661,BOOK X.,"He said, and many chiefs to Diomed"
7662,BOOK X.,"Proffer’d companionship; stood forth at once,"
7663,BOOK X.,"With him to penetrate the Trojan camp,"
7664,BOOK X.,"The two Ajaces, ministers of Mars;"
7665,BOOK X.,"Stood forth Meriones, and eagerly"
7666,BOOK X.,"Stood forth the son of Nestor; Atreus’ son,"
7667,BOOK X.,"The royal Menelaus, spearman bold,"
7668,BOOK X.,"And stout Ulysses, whose enduring heart"
7669,BOOK X.,For ev’ry deed of valour was prepar’d.
7670,BOOK X.,"Rose Agamemnon, King of men, and said:"
7671,BOOK X.,"“Tydides, comrade dearest to my soul,"
7672,BOOK X.,"Choose thou thine own companion, whom thou wilt;"
7673,BOOK X.,Of all the many here that proffer aid
7674,BOOK X.,Him whom thou deem’st the best; nor from respect
7675,BOOK X.,"To persons leave the better man behind,"
7676,BOOK X.,"And take the worse; nor def’rence show to rank,"
7677,BOOK X.,Not though the purest royal blood were his.”
7678,BOOK X.,
7679,BOOK X.,In fear for Menelaus thus he spoke:
7680,BOOK X.,"Then answer’d valiant Diomed, and said;"
7681,BOOK X.,"“If my companion I may freely choose,"
7682,BOOK X.,How can I pass the sage Ulysses by?
7683,BOOK X.,"Of ready wit, and dauntless courage, prov’d"
7684,BOOK X.,In ev’ry danger; and to Pallas dear.
7685,BOOK X.,"I should not fear, by him accompanied,"
7686,BOOK X.,"To pass through fire, and safely both return;"
7687,BOOK X.,So far in prudence he surpasses all.”
7688,BOOK X.,
7689,BOOK X.,"Whom answer’d thus Ulysses, stout of heart:"
7690,BOOK X.,"“Tydides, nor exaggerated praise"
7691,BOOK X.,"Bestow on me, nor censure; for thou speak’st"
7692,BOOK X.,To those who know me all for what I am.
7693,BOOK X.,"But go we; night wanes fast, the morn is near:"
7694,BOOK X.,The stars are high in Heav’n; and of the night
7695,BOOK X.,"Two thirds are spent, one third alone remains.”"
7696,BOOK X.,
7697,BOOK X.,He said; and both prepar’d to don their arms.
7698,BOOK X.,The youthful warrior Thrasymedes gave
7699,BOOK X.,To Diomed a two-edg’d sword (his own
7700,BOOK X.,Had in the ship been left) and ample shield;
7701,BOOK X.,"Then on his brows a leathern headpiece plac’d,"
7702,BOOK X.,"Without or peak or plume; a simple casque,"
7703,BOOK X.,Such as is worn by youths to guard their head.
7704,BOOK X.,"A bow, and well-fill’d quiver, and a sword,"
7705,BOOK X.,Meriones to sage Ulysses gave;
7706,BOOK X.,"And on his brows a leathern headpiece plac’d,"
7707,BOOK X.,"Well wrought within, with num’rous straps secur’d,"
7708,BOOK X.,"And on th’ outside, with wild boars’ gleaming tusks"
7709,BOOK X.,"Profusely garnish’d, scatter’d here and there"
7710,BOOK X.,By skilful hand; the midst with felt was lin’d;
7711,BOOK X.,"This from Amyntor, son of Ormenus,"
7712,BOOK X.,"Autolycus from Eleon bore away,"
7713,BOOK X.,Spoil of his pillag’d house; Autolycus
7714,BOOK X.,"Gave to Amphidamas, Cytheran chief,"
7715,BOOK X.,Who in Scandea dwelt; Amphidamas
7716,BOOK X.,"To Molus, pledge of friendship; he again"
7717,BOOK X.,"Gave to his son, Meriones, from whom"
7718,BOOK X.,It now encircled sage Ulysses’ brow.
7719,BOOK X.,"Thus with accoutrements and arms supplied,"
7720,BOOK X.,"They left their brother chiefs, and took their way."
7721,BOOK X.,"Then close beside their path, by Pallas sent,"
7722,BOOK X.,"Rose, on the right, a heron; through the gloom"
7723,BOOK X.,"They saw it not indeed, but heard the cry."
7724,BOOK X.,"The fav’ring sign with joy Ulysses hail’d,"
7725,BOOK X.,"And thus to Pallas pray’d: “Hear me, thou child"
7726,BOOK X.,"Of aegis-bearing Jove, who still hast stood"
7727,BOOK X.,"In ev’ry peril at my side, whose eye"
7728,BOOK X.,"My ev’ry movement sees; now, Goddess, now"
7729,BOOK X.,"Befriend me; grant that safe, with triumph crown’d,"
7730,BOOK X.,"We may return, some great exploit achiev’d,"
7731,BOOK X.,Such as the Trojans long may bear in mind.”
7732,BOOK X.,
7733,BOOK X.,"Him following, thus the brave Tydides pray’d:"
7734,BOOK X.,"“My voice too, child of Jove, undaunted, hear;"
7735,BOOK X.,"And be with me, as with my father erst,"
7736,BOOK X.,"The godlike Tydeus, when to Thebes he went,"
7737,BOOK X.,"An envoy, in advance; and left behind,"
7738,BOOK X.,Upon Asopus’ banks the mail-clad Greeks.
7739,BOOK X.,Smooth was the message which to Thebes he bore;
7740,BOOK X.,"But great, his mission ended, were the deeds"
7741,BOOK X.,"That with thine aid he wrought; for, Goddess, thou"
7742,BOOK X.,"Wast with him, and thine arm was his defence:"
7743,BOOK X.,"So be thou now with me, and me defend."
7744,BOOK X.,Then on thine altar will I sacrifice
7745,BOOK X.,"A yearling heifer, broad of brow, untam’d,"
7746,BOOK X.,Whereon no yoke hath mortal ever laid:
7747,BOOK X.,"Her will I give, and tip her horns with gold.”"
7748,BOOK X.,
7749,BOOK X.,"Thus as they pray’d, their pray’r the Goddess heard;"
7750,BOOK X.,"Then, their devotions ended, on they far’d"
7751,BOOK X.,"Through the deep dead of night, like lions twain,"
7752,BOOK X.,"’Mid slaughter, corpses, arms, and blacken’d gore."
7753,BOOK X.,
7754,BOOK X.,"Nor, in the Trojan camp, did Hector leave"
7755,BOOK X.,"The chiefs to rest; but all to conf’rence call’d,"
7756,BOOK X.,The leaders and the councillors of Troy;
7757,BOOK X.,To whom his prudent speech he thus address’d:
7758,BOOK X.,"“Who is there here, that for a rich reward"
7759,BOOK X.,A noble work will undertake? A car
7760,BOOK X.,"And two strong-collar’d horses, best of all"
7761,BOOK X.,"That can be found within the Grecian lines,"
7762,BOOK X.,"Shall he receive, who, to his endless praise,"
7763,BOOK X.,Shall dare approach the ships; and learn if still
7764,BOOK X.,"They keep their wonted watch, or, by our arms"
7765,BOOK X.,"Subdued and vanquished, meditate retreat,"
7766,BOOK X.,"And, worn with toil, the nightly watch neglect.”"
7767,BOOK X.,Thus Hector spoke; but all in silence heard.
7768,BOOK X.,
7769,BOOK X.,"There was one Dolon in the Trojan camp,"
7770,BOOK X.,"The herald’s son, Eumedes; rich in gold"
7771,BOOK X.,"And brass; not fair of face, but swift of foot;"
7772,BOOK X.,Amid five sisters he the only son;
7773,BOOK X.,Who thus to Hector and the Trojans spoke:
7774,BOOK X.,
7775,BOOK X.,"“Hector, with dauntless courage I will dare"
7776,BOOK X.,"Approach the ships, and bring thee tidings sure;"
7777,BOOK X.,"But hold thou forth thy royal staff, and swear"
7778,BOOK X.,That I the horses and the brass-bound car
7779,BOOK X.,"Shall have, the boast of Peleus’ matchless son:"
7780,BOOK X.,"Not vain shall be my errand, nor deceive"
7781,BOOK X.,Thy hopes; right through the camp I mean to pass
7782,BOOK X.,"To Agamemnon’s tent, where all the chiefs"
7783,BOOK X.,"Debate in council, or to fight or fly.”"
7784,BOOK X.,
7785,BOOK X.,"He said; and Hector took his royal staff,"
7786,BOOK X.,"And swore to him: “Be witness Jove himself,"
7787,BOOK X.,"The Lord of thunder, that no Trojan man,"
7788,BOOK X.,"Thyself except, shall e’er those horses drive;"
7789,BOOK X.,"For thee they are reserv’d, a glorious prize.”"
7790,BOOK X.,
7791,BOOK X.,Thus Hector swore; though unfulfill’d the oath.
7792,BOOK X.,The hope to Dolon fresh assurance gave.
7793,BOOK X.,"Forthwith, his bow across his shoulders slung,"
7794,BOOK X.,"A grisly wolf-skin o’er it, on his head"
7795,BOOK X.,"A cap of marten’s fur, and in his hand"
7796,BOOK X.,"A jav’lin, from the camp he took his way,"
7797,BOOK X.,Straight to the Grecian ships; but never thence
7798,BOOK X.,Destin’d to bring th’ expected tidings back.
7799,BOOK X.,
7800,BOOK X.,"The crowd of men and horses left behind,"
7801,BOOK X.,Briskly he mov’d along; Ulysses first
7802,BOOK X.,"Mark’d his approach, and to Tydides said:"
7803,BOOK X.,"“See, from the camp where some one this way comes,"
7804,BOOK X.,With what intent I know not; if to play
7805,BOOK X.,"The spy about the ships, or rob the dead."
7806,BOOK X.,"Turn we aside, and let him pass us by"
7807,BOOK X.,A little way; we then with sudden rush
7808,BOOK X.,May seize him; or if he outstrip us both
7809,BOOK X.,"By speed of foot, may urge him tow’rd the ships,"
7810,BOOK X.,"Driving him still before us with our spears,"
7811,BOOK X.,"And from, the city cutting off his flight.”"
7812,BOOK X.,"Thus saying, ’mid the dead, beside the road"
7813,BOOK X.,"They crouch’d; he, all unconscious, hasten’d by."
7814,BOOK X.,But when such space was interpos’d as leave
7815,BOOK X.,Between the sluggish oxen and themselves[3]
7816,BOOK X.,A team of mules (so much the faster they
7817,BOOK X.,"Through the stiff fallow drag the jointed plough),"
7818,BOOK X.,"They rush’d upon him; at the sound he stopp’d,"
7819,BOOK X.,"Deeming that from the Trojan camp they came,"
7820,BOOK X.,"By Hector sent, to order his return."
7821,BOOK X.,"Within a spear’s length when they came, or less,"
7822,BOOK X.,"For foes he knew them, and to night address’d"
7823,BOOK X.,His active limbs; they rush’d in hot pursuit.
7824,BOOK X.,"And as two hounds, well practis’d in the chase,"
7825,BOOK X.,"With glist’ning fangs, unflagging, strain to catch,"
7826,BOOK X.,"In woodland glade, some pricket deer, or hare,"
7827,BOOK X.,"That flies before them, screaming; so those two,"
7828,BOOK X.,"Tydides and Ulysses, stout of heart,"
7829,BOOK X.,"With fiery zeal, unflagging, strain’d to catch"
7830,BOOK X.,"The flying Dolon, from the camp cut off;"
7831,BOOK X.,"But when the fugitive approach’d the ships,"
7832,BOOK X.,"Close by the guard, fresh vigour Pallas gave"
7833,BOOK X.,"To Diomed, lest haply from the walls"
7834,BOOK X.,"Some other might anticipate his blow,"
7835,BOOK X.,And he himself but second honours gain.
7836,BOOK X.,"Tydides then with threat’ning gesture cried,"
7837,BOOK X.,"“Stop, or I hurl my spear; and small thy chance,"
7838,BOOK X.,"If I assail thee, of escape from death.”"
7839,BOOK X.,"He said, and threw his spear; but by design"
7840,BOOK X.,It struck him not; above his shoulder flew
7841,BOOK X.,"The polish’d lance, and quiver’d in the ground."
7842,BOOK X.,"Sudden he stopp’d, with panic paralys’d:"
7843,BOOK X.,"His teeth all chatt’ring, pale with fear he stood,"
7844,BOOK X.,"With falt’ring accents; panting, they came up"
7845,BOOK X.,"And seiz’d him in their grasp; he thus, in tears:"
7846,BOOK X.,“Spare but my life; my life I can redeem;
7847,BOOK X.,"For ample stores I have of gold, and brass,"
7848,BOOK X.,And well-wrought iron; and of these my sire
7849,BOOK X.,"Would pay a gen’rous ransom, could he learn"
7850,BOOK X.,That in the Grecian ships I yet surviv’d.”
7851,BOOK X.,
7852,BOOK X.,"To whom Ulysses, deep-designing, thus:"
7853,BOOK X.,“Be of good cheer; nor let the fear of death
7854,BOOK X.,Disturb thy mind; but tell me truly this;
7855,BOOK X.,"How is ’t that tow’rd the ships thou com’st alone,"
7856,BOOK X.,"In the still night, when other mortals sleep?"
7857,BOOK X.,Com’st thou perchance for plunder of the dead?
7858,BOOK X.,"Or seek’st upon our ships to play the spy,"
7859,BOOK X.,By Hector sent? or of thine own accord?”
7860,BOOK X.,
7861,BOOK X.,Then Dolon thus—his knees with terror shook—
7862,BOOK X.,"“With much persuasion, of my better mind"
7863,BOOK X.,"Hector beguil’d me, off’ring as my prize"
7864,BOOK X.,Achilles’ horses and his brass-bound car;
7865,BOOK X.,"Through the dark night he sent me, and enjoin’d,"
7866,BOOK X.,"Ent’ring your hostile camp, to learn if still"
7867,BOOK X.,"Ye keep your wonted watch, or by our arms"
7868,BOOK X.,"Subdued and vanquish’d, meditate retreat,"
7869,BOOK X.,"And worn with toil, your nightly watch neglect.”"
7870,BOOK X.,
7871,BOOK X.,To whom Ulysses thus with scornful smile:
7872,BOOK X.,"“High soar’d thy hopes indeed, that thought to win"
7873,BOOK X.,The horses of Achilles; hard are they
7874,BOOK X.,"For mortal man to harness or control,"
7875,BOOK X.,"Save for Achilles’ self, the Goddess-born."
7876,BOOK X.,"But tell me truly this; when here thou cam’st,"
7877,BOOK X.,"Where left’st thou Hector, guardian chief of Troy?"
7878,BOOK X.,Where are his warlike arms? his horses where?
7879,BOOK X.,Where lie the rest? and where are plac’d their guards?
7880,BOOK X.,What are their secret counsels? do they mean
7881,BOOK X.,"Here by the ships to keep their ground, or back,"
7882,BOOK X.,"Sated with vict’ry, to the town return?”"
7883,BOOK X.,
7884,BOOK X.,"Whom Dolon answer’d thus, Eumedes’ son:"
7885,BOOK X.,“Thy questions all true answers shall receive;
7886,BOOK X.,"Hector, with those who share his counsels, sits"
7887,BOOK X.,"In conf’rence, far apart, near Ilus’ tomb;"
7888,BOOK X.,"But for the guards thou speak’st of, noble chief,"
7889,BOOK X.,Not one is station’d to protect the camp.
7890,BOOK X.,"Around the Trojan fires indeed, perforce,"
7891,BOOK X.,"A watch is kept; and they, among themselves,"
7892,BOOK X.,"Due caution exercise: but, for th’ Allies,"
7893,BOOK X.,"They sleep, and to the Trojans leave the watch,"
7894,BOOK X.,Since nor their children nor their wives are near.”
7895,BOOK X.,
7896,BOOK X.,To whom in answer sage Ulysses thus:
7897,BOOK X.,"“Say now, where sleep they? with the Trojans mix’d,"
7898,BOOK X.,"Or separate? explain, that I may know.”"
7899,BOOK X.,
7900,BOOK X.,"Whom answer’d Dolon thus, Eumedes’ son:"
7901,BOOK X.,“To this too will I give ye answer true;
7902,BOOK X.,Next to the sea the Carian forces lie;
7903,BOOK X.,"The Paeon archers and the Leleges,"
7904,BOOK X.,"The Caucons, and the bold Pelasgians next;"
7905,BOOK X.,"On Thymbra’s side the Lycians’ lot has fall’n,"
7906,BOOK X.,"The Mysians brave, the Phrygian cavalry,"
7907,BOOK X.,And the Maeonians with their horsehair plumes.
7908,BOOK X.,But why of these enquire? if ye intend
7909,BOOK X.,"An inroad on the camp, apart from all,"
7910,BOOK X.,"New come, the farthest off, the Thracians lie:"
7911,BOOK X.,"Rhesus their King, the son of Eioneus,"
7912,BOOK X.,Sleeps in the midst; no steeds that e’er I saw
7913,BOOK X.,For size and beauty can with his compare:
7914,BOOK X.,"Whiter than snow, and swifter than the wind."
7915,BOOK X.,"With gold and silver is his chariot wrought,"
7916,BOOK X.,"His armour golden, of gigantic size,"
7917,BOOK X.,A marvel to behold! it seems not meet
7918,BOOK X.,"For mortal man, but for th’ immortal Gods."
7919,BOOK X.,But take me now in safety to the ships;
7920,BOOK X.,"Or leave me here in fetters bound, that so,"
7921,BOOK X.,"Ere ye return, ye may approve my words,"
7922,BOOK X.,"And see if I have told you true, or no.”"
7923,BOOK X.,
7924,BOOK X.,To whom thus Diomed with stern regard:
7925,BOOK X.,"“Dolon, though good thy tidings, hope not thou,"
7926,BOOK X.,"Once in our hands, to ’scape the doom of death;"
7927,BOOK X.,"For if we now should let thee go, again"
7928,BOOK X.,"In after times thou mightst our ships approach,"
7929,BOOK X.,"As secret spy, or open enemy:"
7930,BOOK X.,"But if beneath my hands thou lose thy life,"
7931,BOOK X.,No farther trouble shalt thou cause the Greeks.”
7932,BOOK X.,He said; and as the suppliant sought in vain
7933,BOOK X.,"To touch his beard, imploring, through his throat,"
7934,BOOK X.,"Both tendons sev’ring, drove his trenchant blade:"
7935,BOOK X.,"Ev’n while he spoke, his head was roll’d in dust."
7936,BOOK X.,The cap of marten fur from off his head
7937,BOOK X.,"They took, the wolf-skin, and the bow unstrung,"
7938,BOOK X.,"And jav’lin; these Ulysses held aloft,"
7939,BOOK X.,"And thus to Pallas pray’d, who gave the spoil:"
7940,BOOK X.,"“Receive, great Goddess, these our gifts; to thee,"
7941,BOOK X.,"Of all th’ Immortals on Olympus’ height,"
7942,BOOK X.,"Our off’rings first we give; conduct us now,"
7943,BOOK X.,The Thracian camp and Thracian steeds to gain.”
7944,BOOK X.,
7945,BOOK X.,"Thus as he spoke, amid the tamarisk scrub"
7946,BOOK X.,"Far off he threw the trophies; then with reeds,"
7947,BOOK X.,"And twigs new broken from the tamarisk boughs,"
7948,BOOK X.,"He set a mark, lest in the gloom of night"
7949,BOOK X.,"Returning, they might haply miss the spot."
7950,BOOK X.,"Then on they pass’d thro’ arms and blacken’d gore,"
7951,BOOK X.,And reach’d the confines of the Thracian camp.
7952,BOOK X.,There found they all by sleep subdued; their arms
7953,BOOK X.,"Beside them on the ground, in order due,"
7954,BOOK X.,"In triple rows; and by the side of each,"
7955,BOOK X.,"Harness’d and yok’d, his horses ready stood."
7956,BOOK X.,"Surrounded by his warriors, Rhesus slept;"
7957,BOOK X.,"Beside him stood his coursers fleet, their reins"
7958,BOOK X.,Suspended to the chariot’s topmost rail:
7959,BOOK X.,"Ulysses mark’d him as he lay, and said,"
7960,BOOK X.,"“This is the man, Tydides, these the steeds,"
7961,BOOK X.,"To us by Dolon, whom we slew, describ’d."
7962,BOOK X.,"Now then, put forth thy might; beseems it not"
7963,BOOK X.,To stand thus idly with thine arms in hand:
7964,BOOK X.,Loose thou the horses; or do thou the men
7965,BOOK X.,"Despatch, and to my care the horses leave.”"
7966,BOOK X.,
7967,BOOK X.,"He said: and Pallas vigour new inspir’d,"
7968,BOOK X.,That right and left he smote; dire were the groans
7969,BOOK X.,Of slaughter’d men; the earth was red with blood;
7970,BOOK X.,And as a lion on th’ untended flock
7971,BOOK X.,"Of sheep or goats with savage onslaught springs,"
7972,BOOK X.,"Ev’n so Tydides on the Thracians sprang,"
7973,BOOK X.,Till twelve were slain; and as Tydides’ sword
7974,BOOK X.,"Gave each to death, Ulysses by the feet"
7975,BOOK X.,"Drew each aside; reflecting, that perchance"
7976,BOOK X.,"The horses, startled, might refuse to pass"
7977,BOOK X.,The corpses; for as yet they knew them not.
7978,BOOK X.,"But when Tydides saw the sleeping King,"
7979,BOOK X.,"A thirteenth victim to his sword was giv’n,"
7980,BOOK X.,"Painfully breathing; for by Pallas’ art,"
7981,BOOK X.,"He saw that night, as in an evil dream,"
7982,BOOK X.,The son of Œneus standing o’er his head.
7983,BOOK X.,Meanwhile Ulysses sage the horses loos’d;
7984,BOOK X.,"He gather’d up the reins, and with his bow"
7985,BOOK X.,(For whip was none at hand) he drove them forth;
7986,BOOK X.,Then softly whistling to Tydides gave
7987,BOOK X.,"A signal; he, the while, remain’d behind,"
7988,BOOK X.,Musing what bolder deed he yet might do;
7989,BOOK X.,"Whether the seat, whereon the arms were laid,"
7990,BOOK X.,"To draw away, or, lifted high in air,"
7991,BOOK X.,To bear it off in triumph on the car;
7992,BOOK X.,Or on the Thracians farther loss inflict;
7993,BOOK X.,"But while he mus’d, beside him Pallas stood,"
7994,BOOK X.,"And said, “Bethink thee, Tydeus’ son, betimes"
7995,BOOK X.,"Of thy return, lest, if some other God"
7996,BOOK X.,"Should wake the Trojans, thou shouldst need to fly.”"
7997,BOOK X.,
7998,BOOK X.,"She said; the heav’nly voice he recogniz’d,"
7999,BOOK X.,And mounted straight the car; Ulysses touch’d
8000,BOOK X.,"The horses with his bow; and, urg’d to speed,"
8001,BOOK X.,They tow’rd the ships their rapid course pursued.
8002,BOOK X.,
8003,BOOK X.,"Nor idle watch Apollo kept, who saw"
8004,BOOK X.,Tydides o’er the plain by Pallas led;
8005,BOOK X.,"With anger fill’d, the Trojan camp he sought;"
8006,BOOK X.,"And Rhesus’ kinsman, good Hippocoon,"
8007,BOOK X.,"The Thracian councillor, from sleep arous’d;"
8008,BOOK X.,"Awaking, when the vacant space he view’d,"
8009,BOOK X.,Where late had stood the horses; and his friends
8010,BOOK X.,"Gasping in death, and welt’ring in their blood,"
8011,BOOK X.,He groan’d as on his comrade’s name he call’d:
8012,BOOK X.,"Then loud the clamour rose, and wild uproar,"
8013,BOOK X.,"Unspeakable, of Trojans thronging round;"
8014,BOOK X.,They marvell’d at the deeds; but marvell’d more
8015,BOOK X.,How they who wrought them had escap’d unscath’d.
8016,BOOK X.,
8017,BOOK X.,"Meantime arriv’d where Hector’s scout they slew,"
8018,BOOK X.,"Ulysses, lov’d of Heav’n, a moment check’d"
8019,BOOK X.,His eager steeds; Tydides from the car
8020,BOOK X.,"Leap’d to the ground, and in Ulysses’ hand"
8021,BOOK X.,"The bloody trophies plac’d; then mounted quick,"
8022,BOOK X.,"And tow’rd the ships, their destin’d goal, urg’d on"
8023,BOOK X.,"The fiery horses; nothing loth, they flew."
8024,BOOK X.,"Nestor first heard the sound, and cried, “O friends,"
8025,BOOK X.,"The leaders and the councillors of Greece,"
8026,BOOK X.,"Am I deceiv’d, or is it true? methinks"
8027,BOOK X.,"The sound of horses, hurrying, strikes mine ear;"
8028,BOOK X.,"Grant Heav’n, Ulysses and brave Diomed"
8029,BOOK X.,May bring those horses from the Trojan camp;
8030,BOOK X.,Yet much I fear our bravest may have met
8031,BOOK X.,With some disaster ’mid the crowd of foes.”
8032,BOOK X.,
8033,BOOK X.,"He scarce had ended, when themselves appear’d,"
8034,BOOK X.,And from the car descended: welcom’d back
8035,BOOK X.,"With cordial grasp of hands, and friendly words."
8036,BOOK X.,"Gerenian Nestor first, enquiring, said:"
8037,BOOK X.,"“Tell me, renown’d Ulysses, pride of Greece,"
8038,BOOK X.,Whence come these horses? from the Trojan camp?
8039,BOOK X.,"Or hath some God, that met you by the way,"
8040,BOOK X.,"Bestow’d them, radiant as the beams of light?"
8041,BOOK X.,Among the Trojans day by day I move;
8042,BOOK X.,"’Tis not my wont; old warrior though I be,"
8043,BOOK X.,To lag behind; but horses such as these
8044,BOOK X.,"I never saw; some God hath giv’n them, sure;"
8045,BOOK X.,"For Jove, the Cloud-compeller, loves you both,"
8046,BOOK X.,"And Pallas, child of aegis-bearing Jove.”"
8047,BOOK X.,
8048,BOOK X.,To whom again the sage Ulysses thus:
8049,BOOK X.,"“O Nestor, son of Neleus, pride of Greece,"
8050,BOOK X.,"Had they so will’d, the Gods, so great their pow’r,"
8051,BOOK X.,E’en better horses could have giv’n than these;
8052,BOOK X.,"But these, old man, are Thracians, newly come;"
8053,BOOK X.,"Whose King the valiant Diomed hath slain,"
8054,BOOK X.,"And with him twelve, the best of all his band."
8055,BOOK X.,"A scout too have we slain, by Hector sent,"
8056,BOOK X.,"And by the Trojan chiefs, to spy our camp.”"
8057,BOOK X.,
8058,BOOK X.,"He said, and o’er the ditch the horses drove,"
8059,BOOK X.,Exulting in their prize; and with him went
8060,BOOK X.,"The other chiefs, rejoicing, through the camp."
8061,BOOK X.,"Arriv’d at Diomed’s well-order’d tent,"
8062,BOOK X.,"First with strong halters to the rack, where stood,"
8063,BOOK X.,"High-fed with corn, his own swift-footed steeds,"
8064,BOOK X.,The horses they secur’d; Ulysses then
8065,BOOK X.,The bloody spoils of Dolon stow’d away
8066,BOOK X.,"In the ship’s stern, till fitting sacrifice"
8067,BOOK X.,To Pallas might be offer’d; to the sea
8068,BOOK X.,"Descending then, they wash’d away the sweat,"
8069,BOOK X.,"Which on their necks, and thighs, and knees had dried;"
8070,BOOK X.,"The sweat wash’d off, and in the ocean waves"
8071,BOOK X.,"Themselves refresh’d, they sought the polish’d bath;"
8072,BOOK X.,"Then, by the bath restor’d, and all their limbs"
8073,BOOK X.,"Anointed freely with the lissom oil,"
8074,BOOK X.,Sat down to breakfast; and from flowing bowls
8075,BOOK X.,In Pallas’ honour pour’d the luscious wine.

8130,BOOK XI.,"First on his legs the well-wrought greaves he fix’d,"
8131,BOOK XI.,Fasten’d with silver clasps; his ample chest
8132,BOOK XI.,"A breastplate guarded, giv’n by Cinyras"
8133,BOOK XI.,In pledge of friendship; for in Cyprus’ isle
8134,BOOK XI.,He heard the rumour of the glorious fleet
8135,BOOK XI.,About to sail for Troy; and sought with gifts
8136,BOOK XI.,To win the favour of the mighty King.
8137,BOOK XI.,"Ten bands were there inwrought of dusky bronze,"
8138,BOOK XI.,"Twelve of pure gold, twice ten of shining tin:"
8139,BOOK XI.,Of bronze six dragons upwards tow’rds the neck

8143,BOOK XI.,Then o’er his shoulder threw his sword; bright flash’d
8144,BOOK XI.,"The golden studs; the silver scabbard shone,"
8145,BOOK XI.,With golden baldrick fitted; next his shield
8146,BOOK XI.,"He took, full-siz’d, well-wrought, well-prov’d in fight;"
8147,BOOK XI.,Around it ran ten circling rims of brass;
8148,BOOK XI.,"With twenty bosses round of burnish’d tin,"
8149,BOOK XI.,"And, in the centre, one of dusky bronze."
8150,BOOK XI.,"A Gorgon’s head, with aspect terrible,"
8151,BOOK XI.,"Was wrought, with Fear and Flight encircled round:"
8152,BOOK XI.,Depending from a silver belt it hung;

8159,BOOK XI.,"Then took two weighty lances, tipp’d with brass,"
8160,BOOK XI.,Which fiercely flash’d against the face of Heav’n:
8161,BOOK XI.,Pallas and Juno thund’ring from on high
8162,BOOK XI.,In honour of Mycenæ’s wealthy lord.
8163,BOOK XI.,
8164,BOOK XI.,"Forthwith they order’d, each his charioteer,"
8165,BOOK XI.,"To stay his car beside the ditch; themselves,"
8166,BOOK XI.,"On foot, in arms accoutred, sallied forth,"
8167,BOOK XI.,"And loud, ere early dawn, the clamour rose."
8168,BOOK XI.,"Advanc’d before the cars, they lin’d the ditch;"
8169,BOOK XI.,"Follow’d the cars, a little space between:"
8170,BOOK XI.,"But Jove with dire confusion fill’d their ranks,"
8171,BOOK XI.,Who sent from Heav’n a show’r of blood-stain’d rain.
8172,BOOK XI.,"In sign of many a warrior’s coming doom,"
8173,BOOK XI.,Soon to the viewless shades untimely sent.
8174,BOOK XI.,"Meanwhile upon the slope, beneath the plain,"

8180,BOOK XI.,In front was seen the broad circumference
8181,BOOK XI.,Of Hector’s shield; and as amid the clouds
8182,BOOK XI.,"Shines forth the fiery dog-star, bright and clear,"
8183,BOOK XI.,Anon beneath the cloudy veil conceal’d;
8184,BOOK XI.,"So now in front was Hector seen, and now"
8185,BOOK XI.,"Pass’d to the rear, exhorting; all in brass,"
8186,BOOK XI.,His burnish’d arms like Jove’s own lightning flash’d.
8187,BOOK XI.,
8188,BOOK XI.,As in the corn-land of some wealthy Lord
8189,BOOK XI.,"The rival bands of reapers mow the swathe,"
8190,BOOK XI.,Barley or wheat; and fast the trusses fall;
8191,BOOK XI.,So Greeks and Trojans mow’d th’ opposing ranks;
8192,BOOK XI.,"Nor these admitted thought of faint retreat,"
8193,BOOK XI.,"But still made even head; while those, like wolves,"
8194,BOOK XI.,"Rush’d to the onset; Discord, Goddess dire,"

8196,BOOK XI.,She only mingled with the combatants;
8197,BOOK XI.,"The others all were absent; they, serene,"
8198,BOOK XI.,"Repos’d in gorgeous palaces, for each"
8199,BOOK XI.,Amid Olympus’ deep recesses built.
8200,BOOK XI.,"Yet all the cloud-girt son of Saturn blam’d,"
8201,BOOK XI.,Who will’d the vict’ry to the arms of Troy.
8202,BOOK XI.,He heeded not their anger; but withdrawn
8203,BOOK XI.,"Apart from all, in pride of conscious strength,"
8204,BOOK XI.,"Survey’d the walls of Troy, the ships of Greece,"
8205,BOOK XI.,"The flash of arms, the slayers and the slain."

8207,BOOK XI.,"While yet ’twas morn, and wax’d the youthful day,"

8209,BOOK XI.,On either side: but when the hour was come
8210,BOOK XI.,"When woodmen, in the forest’s deep recess,"
8211,BOOK XI.,"Prepare their food, and wearied with the toil"
8212,BOOK XI.,"Of felling loftiest trees, with aching arms"
8213,BOOK XI.,Turn with keen relish to their midday meal;
8214,BOOK XI.,"Then Grecian valour broke th’ opposing ranks,"
8215,BOOK XI.,As each along the line encourag’d each;
8216,BOOK XI.,"First sprang the monarch Agamemnon forth,"
8217,BOOK XI.,"And brave Bienor slew, his people’s guard;"
8218,BOOK XI.,"And, with the chief, his friend and charioteer,"
8219,BOOK XI.,"Oileus; he, down-leaping from the car,"
8220,BOOK XI.,Stood forth defiant; but between his brows
8221,BOOK XI.,The monarch’s spear was thrust; nor aught avail’d
8222,BOOK XI.,"The brass-bound helm, to stay the weapon’s point;"
8223,BOOK XI.,"Through helm and bone it pass’d, and all the brain"
8224,BOOK XI.,"Was shatter’d; forward as he rush’d, he fell."
8225,BOOK XI.,"Them left he there, their bare breasts gleaming white,"
8226,BOOK XI.,Stripp’d of their arms; and hasten’d in pursuit
8227,BOOK XI.,"Of Antiphus and Isus, Priam’s sons,"
8228,BOOK XI.,"A bastard one, and one legitimate,"
8229,BOOK XI.,Both on one car; the bastard held the reins:
8230,BOOK XI.,Beside him stood the gallant Antiphus.
8231,BOOK XI.,"Them, as they fed their flocks on Ida’s heights,"
8232,BOOK XI.,"Achilles once had captive made, and bound"
8233,BOOK XI.,"With willow saplings, till for ransom freed."
8234,BOOK XI.,"The mighty monarch, Agamemnon, drove"
8235,BOOK XI.,Through Isus’ breast his spear; his weighty sword
8236,BOOK XI.,Descended on the head of Antiphus
8237,BOOK XI.,"Beside the ear, and hurl’d him from his car;"
8238,BOOK XI.,"These of their armour he despoil’d in haste,"
8239,BOOK XI.,Known to him both; for he had seen them oft
8240,BOOK XI.,"Beside the ships, when thither captive brought"
8241,BOOK XI.,"From Ida by Achilles, swift of foot."
8242,BOOK XI.,As when a lion in their lair hath seiz’d
8243,BOOK XI.,"The helpless offspring of a mountain doe,"
8244,BOOK XI.,"And breaks their bones with ease, and with strong teeth"
8245,BOOK XI.,"Crushes their tender life; nor can their dam,"
8246,BOOK XI.,"Though close at hand she be, avail them aught;"
8247,BOOK XI.,"For she herself by deadly terror seiz’d,"
8248,BOOK XI.,"Through the thick coppice and the forest flies,"
8249,BOOK XI.,"Panting, and bath’d in sweat, the monster’s rush;"
8250,BOOK XI.,"So dar’d no Trojan give those brethren aid,"
8251,BOOK XI.,Themselves in terror of the warlike Greeks.
8252,BOOK XI.,"Peisander next, and bold Hippolochus,"
8253,BOOK XI.,"Sons of Antimachus (’twas he who chief,"
8254,BOOK XI.,"Seduc’d by Paris’ gold and splendid gifts,"
8255,BOOK XI.,Advis’d the restitution to refuse
8256,BOOK XI.,"Of Helen to her Lord), the King assail’d;"
8257,BOOK XI.,Both on one car; but from their hands had dropp’d
8258,BOOK XI.,The broider’d reins; bewilder’d there they stood;
8259,BOOK XI.,"While, with a lion’s bound, upon them sprang"
8260,BOOK XI.,"The son of Atreus; suppliant, in the car,"
8261,BOOK XI.,"They clasp’d his knees; “Give quarter, Atreus’ son,"
8262,BOOK XI.,Redeem our lives; our sire Antimachus
8263,BOOK XI.,"Possesses goodly store of brass and gold,"
8264,BOOK XI.,And well-wrought iron; and of these he fain
8265,BOOK XI.,"Would pay a noble ransom, could he hear"
8266,BOOK XI.,That in the Grecian ships we yet surviv’d.”
8267,BOOK XI.,
8268,BOOK XI.,"Thus they, with gentle words, and tears, imploring;"
8269,BOOK XI.,But all ungentle was the voice they heard
8270,BOOK XI.,In answer; “If indeed ye be the sons
8271,BOOK XI.,"Of that Antimachus, who counsel gave,"
8272,BOOK XI.,When noble Menelaus came to Troy
8273,BOOK XI.,"With sage Ulysses, as ambassadors,"
8274,BOOK XI.,"To slay them both, nor suffer their return,"
8275,BOOK XI.,Pay now the forfeit of your father’s guilt.”
8276,BOOK XI.,"He said, and with a spear-thrust through his breast"
8277,BOOK XI.,Peisander dash’d to earth; backward he fell.
8278,BOOK XI.,Down leap’d Hippolochus; but Atreus’ son
8279,BOOK XI.,"Severing his hands and neck, amid the throng"
8280,BOOK XI.,Sent whirling like a bowl the gory head.
8281,BOOK XI.,These left he there; and where the thickest throng
8282,BOOK XI.,"Maintain’d the tug of war, thither he flew,"
8283,BOOK XI.,And with him eager hosts of well-greav’d Greeks.
8284,BOOK XI.,"Soon on the Trojans’ flight enforc’d they hung,"
8285,BOOK XI.,"Destroying; foot on foot, and horse on horse;"
8286,BOOK XI.,While from the plain thick clouds of dust arose
8287,BOOK XI.,Beneath the armed hoofs of clatt’ring steeds;
8288,BOOK XI.,"And on the monarch Agamemnon press’d,"
8289,BOOK XI.,"Still slaying, urging still the Greeks to arms."
8290,BOOK XI.,As when amid a densely timber’d wood
8291,BOOK XI.,"Light the devouring flames, by eddying winds"
8292,BOOK XI.,"Hither and thither borne, fast falls the copse"
8293,BOOK XI.,Prostrate beneath the fire’s impetuous course;
8294,BOOK XI.,So thickly fell the flying Trojans’ heads
8295,BOOK XI.,Beneath the might of Agamemnon’s arm;
8296,BOOK XI.,"And here and there, athwart the pass of war,"
8297,BOOK XI.,Was many an empty car at random whirl’d
8298,BOOK XI.,"By strong-neck’d steeds, of guiding hands bereft;"
8299,BOOK XI.,"Stretch’d on the plain they lay, more welcome sight"
8300,BOOK XI.,To carrion birds than to their widow’d wives.
8301,BOOK XI.,"But Hector, from the fray and din of war,"
8302,BOOK XI.,"And dust, and blood, and carnage, Jove withdrew."
8303,BOOK XI.,"Still on Atrides press’d, the Greek pursuit"
8304,BOOK XI.,With eager shouts exciting; past the tomb
8305,BOOK XI.,"Of Ilus, ancient son of Dardanus,"
8306,BOOK XI.,"And tow’rd the fig-tree, midway o’er the plain,"
8307,BOOK XI.,"Straining to gain the town, the Trojans fled;"
8308,BOOK XI.,"While loudly shouting, his unconquer’d hands"
8309,BOOK XI.,"With carnage dyed, Atrides urg’d their flight."
8310,BOOK XI.,"But when the Scaean gates and oak were reach’d,"
8311,BOOK XI.,"They made a stand, and fac’d the foe’s assault."
8312,BOOK XI.,Some o’er the open plain were yet dispers’d;
8313,BOOK XI.,"As heifers, by a lion scatter’d wide,"
8314,BOOK XI.,At dead of night; all fly; on one descends
8315,BOOK XI.,The doom of death; her with his pow’rful teeth
8316,BOOK XI.,"He seizes, and, her neck first broken, rends,"
8317,BOOK XI.,"And on her entrails gorging, laps her blood."
8318,BOOK XI.,"So these the monarch Agamemnon chas’d,"
8319,BOOK XI.,Slaying the hindmost; they in terror fled:
8320,BOOK XI.,"Some headlong, backward some, Atrides’ hand"
8321,BOOK XI.,Hurl’d from their chariot many a warrior bold;
8322,BOOK XI.,So forward and so fierce he bore his spear.
8323,BOOK XI.,"But as he near’d the city, and stood beneath"
8324,BOOK XI.,"The lofty wall, the Sire of Gods and men"
8325,BOOK XI.,From Heav’n descended; on the topmost height
8326,BOOK XI.,Of Ida’s spring-abounding hill he sat:
8327,BOOK XI.,"And while his hand the lightning grasp’d, he thus"
8328,BOOK XI.,To golden-winged Iris gave command:
8329,BOOK XI.,
8330,BOOK XI.,"“Haste thee, swift Iris, and to Hector bear"
8331,BOOK XI.,"From me this message; bid him, that as long"
8332,BOOK XI.,"As Agamemnon in the van appears,"
8333,BOOK XI.,"Raging, and dealing death among the ranks,"
8334,BOOK XI.,"He from the battle keep himself aloof,"
8335,BOOK XI.,But urge the rest undaunted to maintain
8336,BOOK XI.,"The stubborn fight; but should Atrides, struck"
8337,BOOK XI.,"By spear or arrow, to his car withdraw,"
8338,BOOK XI.,"He shall from me receive such pow’r to slay,"
8339,BOOK XI.,"As to the ships shall bear him, ere the sun"
8340,BOOK XI.,"Decline, and Darkness spread her hallowing shade.”"
8341,BOOK XI.,
8342,BOOK XI.,"Thus he; to Troy, obedient to his word,"
8343,BOOK XI.,From Ida’s heights swift-footed Iris sped:
8344,BOOK XI.,Amid the horses and the well-fram’d cars
8345,BOOK XI.,"The godlike Hector, Priam’s son, she found,"
8346,BOOK XI.,"And stood beside him, and address’d him thus:"
8347,BOOK XI.,
8348,BOOK XI.,"“Hector, thou son of Priam, sage as Jove"
8349,BOOK XI.,"In council, he the Universal Lord"
8350,BOOK XI.,Sends thee by me this message; that as long
8351,BOOK XI.,"As Agamemnon in the van appears,"
8352,BOOK XI.,"Raging, and dealing death amid the ranks,"
8353,BOOK XI.,"Thou from the battle keep thyself aloof,"
8354,BOOK XI.,But urge the rest undaunted to maintain
8355,BOOK XI.,"The stubborn fight; but should Atrides, struck"
8356,BOOK XI.,"By spear or arrow, to his car withdraw,"
8357,BOOK XI.,Thou shalt from him receive such pow’r to slay
8358,BOOK XI.,"As to the ships shall bear thee, ere the sun"
8359,BOOK XI.,"Decline, and Darkness spread her hallowing shade.”"
8360,BOOK XI.,
8361,BOOK XI.,"Swift-footed Iris said, and disappear’d;"
8362,BOOK XI.,"But from his chariot Hector leap’d to earth,"
8363,BOOK XI.,"Hither and thither passing through the ranks,"
8364,BOOK XI.,With brandish’d jav’lins urging to the fight.
8365,BOOK XI.,"Loud, at his bidding, rose the battle-cry;"
8366,BOOK XI.,Back roll’d the tide; again they fac’d the Greeks:
8367,BOOK XI.,"On th’ other side the Greeks their masses form’d,"
8368,BOOK XI.,In line of battle rang’d; opposed they stood;
8369,BOOK XI.,"And in the front, to none content to cede"
8370,BOOK XI.,"The foremost place, was Agamemnon seen."
8371,BOOK XI.,
8372,BOOK XI.,"Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell,"
8373,BOOK XI.,"Of all the Trojans and their fam’d Allies,"
8374,BOOK XI.,Who first oppos’d to Agamemnon stood.
8375,BOOK XI.,"Iphidamas, Antenor’s gallant son,"
8376,BOOK XI.,"Stalwart and brave; in fertile Thracia bred,"
8377,BOOK XI.,"Mother of flocks; him, in his infant years,"
8378,BOOK XI.,"His grandsire Cisseus, fair Theano’s sire,"
8379,BOOK XI.,In his own palace rear’d; and when he reach’d
8380,BOOK XI.,"The perfect measure of his glorious youth,"
8381,BOOK XI.,"Still in his house retain’d him, and to wife"
8382,BOOK XI.,Gave him his daughter; but when tidings came
8383,BOOK XI.,"Of Grecian warfare, from the marriage straight"
8384,BOOK XI.,"Embarking, with twelve beaked ships he sailed,"
8385,BOOK XI.,That owned his sway; these on Percote’s shore
8386,BOOK XI.,He left; and came himself on foot to Troy;
8387,BOOK XI.,Who now confronted Atreus’ godlike son.
8388,BOOK XI.,
8389,BOOK XI.,"When near they drew, Atrides miss’d his aim,"
8390,BOOK XI.,His spear diverging; then Iphidamas
8391,BOOK XI.,"Beneath the breastplate, striking on his belt,"
8392,BOOK XI.,Strove with strong hand to drive the weapon home:
8393,BOOK XI.,Yet could not pierce the belt’s close-plaited work;
8394,BOOK XI.,"The point, encounter’d by the silver fold,"
8395,BOOK XI.,"Was bent, like lead; then with his pow’rful hand"
8396,BOOK XI.,"The monarch Agamemnon seiz’d the spear,"
8397,BOOK XI.,"And tow’rd him drew, and with a lion’s strength"
8398,BOOK XI.,Wrench’d from his foeman’s grasp; then on his neck
8399,BOOK XI.,"Let fall his sword, and slack’d his limbs in death."
8400,BOOK XI.,"There, falling in his country’s cause, he slept"
8401,BOOK XI.,"The iron sleep of death; unhappy he,"
8402,BOOK XI.,"Far from his virgin-bride, yet unpossess’d,"
8403,BOOK XI.,Though bought with costly presents; first he gave
8404,BOOK XI.,A hundred steers; and promis’d thousands more
8405,BOOK XI.,Of sheep and goats from out his countless flocks.
8406,BOOK XI.,"Him Agamemnon of his arms despoil’d,"
8407,BOOK XI.,And to the crowd of Greeks the trophies bore.
8408,BOOK XI.,"But when Antenor’s eldest-born beheld,"
8409,BOOK XI.,"Coon, th’ observ’d of all men, bitt’rest grief"
8410,BOOK XI.,"His eyes o’ershadow’d, for his brother’s fate;"
8411,BOOK XI.,"And, unperceiv’d by Atreus’ godlike son,"
8412,BOOK XI.,"Standing aside, he struck him with his spear,"
8413,BOOK XI.,"Through the mid arm, beneath the elbow’s bend;"
8414,BOOK XI.,And drove right through the weapon’s glitt’ring point.
8415,BOOK XI.,Writh’d with the pain the mighty King of men;
8416,BOOK XI.,"Yet from the combat flinch’d he not, nor quail’d:"
8417,BOOK XI.,But grasping firm his weather-toughen’d spear
8418,BOOK XI.,"On Coon rush’d, as by the feet he drew"
8419,BOOK XI.,"His father’s son, Iphidamas, away,"
8420,BOOK XI.,Invoking all the bravest to his aid;
8421,BOOK XI.,"And as he drew the body tow’rd the crowd,"
8422,BOOK XI.,Beneath the bossy shield the monarch thrust
8423,BOOK XI.,"His brass-clad spear, and slack’d his limbs in death;"
8424,BOOK XI.,"Then near approaching, ev’n upon the corpse"
8425,BOOK XI.,"Of dead Iphidamas, struck off his head:"
8426,BOOK XI.,"So by Atrides’ hand, Antenor’s sons,"
8427,BOOK XI.,"Their doom accomplish’d, to the shades were sent."
8428,BOOK XI.,"Then through the crowded ranks, with spear and sword,"
8429,BOOK XI.,"And massive stones, he held his furious course,"
8430,BOOK XI.,While the hot blood was welling from his arm;
8431,BOOK XI.,"But when the wound was dry, and stanch’d the blood,"
8432,BOOK XI.,Keen anguish then Atrides’ might subdued.
8433,BOOK XI.,As when a woman in her labour-throes
8434,BOOK XI.,"Sharp pangs encompass, by Lucina sent,"
8435,BOOK XI.,"Who rules o’er child-birth travail, ev’n so keen"
8436,BOOK XI.,The pangs that then Atrides’ might subdued.
8437,BOOK XI.,Mounting his car he bade his charioteer
8438,BOOK XI.,Drive to the ships; for sore his spirit was pain’d;
8439,BOOK XI.,But loud and clear he shouted to the Greeks:
8440,BOOK XI.,"“O friends, the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
8441,BOOK XI.,Yours be it now our sea-borne ships to guard:
8442,BOOK XI.,"Since Jove, the Lord of counsel, through the day"
8443,BOOK XI.,Wills not that I the battle should maintain.”
8444,BOOK XI.,
8445,BOOK XI.,He said: and swiftly to the ships were driv’n
8446,BOOK XI.,His sleek-skinn’d coursers; nothing loth they flew;
8447,BOOK XI.,"With foam their chests were fleck’d, with dust their flanks,"
8448,BOOK XI.,As from the field their wounded Lord they bore:
8449,BOOK XI.,"But Hector, as he saw the King retire,"
8450,BOOK XI.,To Trojans and to Lycians call’d aloud:
8451,BOOK XI.,
8452,BOOK XI.,"“Trojans and Lycians, and ye Dardans fam’d"
8453,BOOK XI.,"In close encounter, quit ye now like men;"
8454,BOOK XI.,Put forth your wonted valour; from the field
8455,BOOK XI.,"Their bravest has withdrawn, and Jove on me"
8456,BOOK XI.,Great glory hath shed; now headlong on the Greeks
8457,BOOK XI.,"Urge your swift steeds, and endless honour gain.”"
8458,BOOK XI.,
8459,BOOK XI.,His words fresh courage rous’d in ev’ry breast:
8460,BOOK XI.,And as a hunter cheers his sharp-fang’d hounds
8461,BOOK XI.,On forest boar or lion; on the Greeks
8462,BOOK XI.,"So cheer’d the valiant Trojans Priam’s son,"
8463,BOOK XI.,"Illustrious Hector, stern as blood-stain’d Mars."
8464,BOOK XI.,"Bent on high deeds, himself in front advanc’d,"
8465,BOOK XI.,"Fell on the masses as a whirlwind falls,"
8466,BOOK XI.,Lashing with furious sweep the dark-blue sea.
8467,BOOK XI.,
8468,BOOK XI.,"Say then, who first, who last, by Hector’s hand,"
8469,BOOK XI.,"Whom Jove had will’d to crown with honour, died."
8470,BOOK XI.,"Assaeus first, and then Autonous,"
8471,BOOK XI.,"Opites, and Opheltius, Dolops, son"
8472,BOOK XI.,"Of Clytus, and Æsumnus, Agelas"
8473,BOOK XI.,"And Orus, and brave Hipponous;"
8474,BOOK XI.,All these the chiefs of Greece; the nameless crowd
8475,BOOK XI.,He scatter’d next; as when the west wind drives
8476,BOOK XI.,"The clouds, and battles with the hurricane,"
8477,BOOK XI.,Before the clearing blast of Notus driv’n;
8478,BOOK XI.,"The big waves heave and roll, and high aloft,"
8479,BOOK XI.,"The gale, careering, flings the ocean spray;"
8480,BOOK XI.,So thick and furious fell on hostile heads
8481,BOOK XI.,The might of Hector. Now had fearful deeds
8482,BOOK XI.,"Been done, and Greeks beside their ships had fall’n"
8483,BOOK XI.,"In shameful rout, had not Ulysses thus"
8484,BOOK XI.,"To Diomed, the son of Tydeus, call’d:"
8485,BOOK XI.,
8486,BOOK XI.,"“Why, son of Tydeus, should we thus relax"
8487,BOOK XI.,"Our warlike courage? come, stand by me now,"
8488,BOOK XI.,True friend! if Hector of the glancing helm
8489,BOOK XI.,"Our ships should capture, great were our disgrace.”"
8490,BOOK XI.,
8491,BOOK XI.,Whom answer’d thus the valiant Diomed:
8492,BOOK XI.,"“Beside thee will I stand, and still endure;"
8493,BOOK XI.,"But brief will be the term of our success,"
8494,BOOK XI.,"Since Jove, the Cloud-compeller, not to us,"
8495,BOOK XI.,"But to the Trojans, wills the victory.”"
8496,BOOK XI.,
8497,BOOK XI.,"He said, and from his car Thymbraeus hurl’d,"
8498,BOOK XI.,Through the left breast transfix’d: Ulysses’ hand
8499,BOOK XI.,"His charioteer, the brave Molion, slew."
8500,BOOK XI.,"These left they there, no more to share the fight;"
8501,BOOK XI.,"Then turning, spread confusion ’mid the crowd:"
8502,BOOK XI.,As turn two boars upon the hunter’s pack
8503,BOOK XI.,"With desp’rate courage, turning so to bay,"
8504,BOOK XI.,"Those two, the Trojans scatt’ring, gave the Greeks,"
8505,BOOK XI.,"From Hector flying, time again to breathe."
8506,BOOK XI.,"A car they seiz’d which bore two valiant chiefs,"
8507,BOOK XI.,"Sons of Percotian Merops; he, o’er all"
8508,BOOK XI.,"In lore prophetic skill’d, would fain at home"
8509,BOOK XI.,Have kept them from the life-destroying war:
8510,BOOK XI.,"But they, by adverse fate impell’d to seek"
8511,BOOK XI.,"Their doom of death, his warning voice despis’d."
8512,BOOK XI.,"These two, of strength and life at once bereft,"
8513,BOOK XI.,"The son of Tydeus, valiant Diomed,"
8514,BOOK XI.,Stripp’d of their armour; while Ulysses slew
8515,BOOK XI.,"Hippodamus, and bold Hyperochus."
8516,BOOK XI.,"Thus Jove, from Ida’s height beholding, held"
8517,BOOK XI.,"His even scale, each party slaught’ring each."
8518,BOOK XI.,Then with his spear Tydides through the loins
8519,BOOK XI.,"Agastrophus, the son of Paeon, smote;"
8520,BOOK XI.,"No car had he at hand, whereto to fly:"
8521,BOOK XI.,"But, ill-advis’d, had in th’ attendants’ charge"
8522,BOOK XI.,His horses left far off; while he himself
8523,BOOK XI.,"Rush’d ’mid the throng on foot, and met his doom."
8524,BOOK XI.,"Hector’s quick glance athwart the files beheld,"
8525,BOOK XI.,"And to the rescue, with a shout, he sprang,"
8526,BOOK XI.,The Trojan columns following; not unmov’d
8527,BOOK XI.,"The valiant Diomed his coming saw,"
8528,BOOK XI.,And thus bespoke Ulysses at his side:
8529,BOOK XI.,"“On us this plague, this mighty Hector, falls:"
8530,BOOK XI.,"Yet stand we firm, and boldly meet the shock.”"
8531,BOOK XI.,"He said, and, poising, hurl’d his pond’rous spear,"
8532,BOOK XI.,And not in vain; on Hector’s head it struck
8533,BOOK XI.,"His helmet’s crest, but, brass encount’ring brass,"
8534,BOOK XI.,"Himself it reach’d not; for the visor’d helm,"
8535,BOOK XI.,"Apollo’s gift, three-plated, stay’d its force."
8536,BOOK XI.,"Yet backward Hector sprang amid the crowd,"
8537,BOOK XI.,"And on his knees he dropp’d, his stalwart hand"
8538,BOOK XI.,Propp’d on the ground; while darkness veil’d his eyes.
8539,BOOK XI.,"But ere Tydides, following up his spear,"
8540,BOOK XI.,"Attain’d from far the spot whereon he fell,"
8541,BOOK XI.,"Hector reviv’d, and mounting quick his car,"
8542,BOOK XI.,"Drove ’mid the crowd, and ’scap’d the doom of death"
8543,BOOK XI.,"Then thus, with threat’ning spear, Tydides cried:"
8544,BOOK XI.,"“Yet once again, vile hound, hast thou escap’d;"
8545,BOOK XI.,"Thy doom was nigh; but thee thy God hath sav’d,"
8546,BOOK XI.,"Phoebus, to whom, amid the clash of spears,"
8547,BOOK XI.,Well mayst thou pray! We yet shall meet again;
8548,BOOK XI.,"When I shall end thee, if a guardian God"
8549,BOOK XI.,"I too may claim; meanwhile from thee I turn,"
8550,BOOK XI.,And others seek on whom my hap may light.”
8551,BOOK XI.,
8552,BOOK XI.,"He said, and turn’d him of his arms to strip"
8553,BOOK XI.,The son of Paeon; but beside the stone
8554,BOOK XI.,That mark’d where men of old had rais’d a mound
8555,BOOK XI.,"To Ilus, Dardan’s son, the ancient chief,"
8556,BOOK XI.,"There crouching, Paris, fair-hair’d Helen’s Lord,"
8557,BOOK XI.,Against the son of Tydeus bent his bow.
8558,BOOK XI.,He from the breast of brave Agastrophus
8559,BOOK XI.,Had stripp’d the corslet; from his shoulders broad
8560,BOOK XI.,"The buckler, and the helmet from his head,"
8561,BOOK XI.,"When Paris bent his bow, and not in vain"
8562,BOOK XI.,His arrow launch’d; Tydides’ dexter foot
8563,BOOK XI.,"Right through it pierc’d, and pinn’d it to the ground."
8564,BOOK XI.,"Joyous he laugh’d, and from his hiding place"
8565,BOOK XI.,"Sprang forth, and thus in tones of triumph cried:"
8566,BOOK XI.,
8567,BOOK XI.,“Thou hast it! not in vain my shaft hath flown!
8568,BOOK XI.,"Would that, deep buried in thy flank, it touch’d"
8569,BOOK XI.,Thy very life! so should our Trojans lose
8570,BOOK XI.,"Their panic fear, who now on thee with dread,"
8571,BOOK XI.,"As bleating goats upon a lion, look.”"
8572,BOOK XI.,
8573,BOOK XI.,"To whom, unmov’d, the valiant Diomed:"
8574,BOOK XI.,"“Poor archer, trusting to thy bow alone,"
8575,BOOK XI.,Vile sland’rer and seducer! if indeed
8576,BOOK XI.,"Thou durst in arms oppos’d to me to stand,"
8577,BOOK XI.,Nought would avail thy arrows and thy bow:
8578,BOOK XI.,"And now, because thy shaft hath graz’d my foot,"
8579,BOOK XI.,"Thou mak’st thine empty boast: I heed thee not,"
8580,BOOK XI.,More than a woman or a puny child:
8581,BOOK XI.,A worthless coward’s weapon hath no point.
8582,BOOK XI.,"’Tis diff’rent far with me! though light it fall,"
8583,BOOK XI.,"My spear is sharp, and whom it strikes, it slays."
8584,BOOK XI.,"His widow’s cheeks are mark’d with scars of grief,"
8585,BOOK XI.,"His children orphans; rotting on the ground,"
8586,BOOK XI.,"Red with his blood, he lies, his fun’ral rites"
8587,BOOK XI.,"By carrion birds, and not by women paid.”"
8588,BOOK XI.,
8589,BOOK XI.,"Thus while he spoke, Ulysses, spearman bold,"
8590,BOOK XI.,"Drew near, and stood before him; he, behind,"
8591,BOOK XI.,"Sat down protected, and from out his foot"
8592,BOOK XI.,The arrow drew; whereat sharp anguish shot
8593,BOOK XI.,Through all his flesh; and mounting on his car
8594,BOOK XI.,He bade his faithful charioteer in haste
8595,BOOK XI.,"Drive to the ships, for pain weigh’d down his soul."
8596,BOOK XI.,Alone Ulysses stood; of all the Greeks
8597,BOOK XI.,Not one beside him; all were panic-struck:
8598,BOOK XI.,"Then with his spirit, perturb’d, he commun’d thus:"
8599,BOOK XI.,“Me miserable! which way shall I choose?
8600,BOOK XI.,’Twere ill indeed that I should turn to flight
8601,BOOK XI.,By hostile numbers daunted; yet ’twere worse
8602,BOOK XI.,Here to be caught alone; and Saturn’s son
8603,BOOK XI.,With panic fear the other Greeks hath fill’d.
8604,BOOK XI.,"Yet why, my soul, admit such thoughts as these?"
8605,BOOK XI.,I know that cowards from the battle fly;
8606,BOOK XI.,"But he who boasts a warrior’s name, must learn,"
8607,BOOK XI.,"Wounded or wounding, firmly still to stand.”"
8608,BOOK XI.,
8609,BOOK XI.,"While in his mind and spirit thus he mus’d,"
8610,BOOK XI.,"Onward the buckler’d ranks of Trojans came,"
8611,BOOK XI.,"And, to their harm, encircled him around."
8612,BOOK XI.,"As when a boar, by dogs and stalwart youths"
8613,BOOK XI.,"Attack’d, the shelt’ring thicket leaves, and whets"
8614,BOOK XI.,The tusks that gleam between his curved jaws;
8615,BOOK XI.,"They crowd around, though ring his clatt’ring tusks,"
8616,BOOK XI.,"And, fearful though it be, await his rush:"
8617,BOOK XI.,"So crowded round Ulysses, dear to Jove,"
8618,BOOK XI.,"The Trojans; he, with brandish’d spear aloft,"
8619,BOOK XI.,"Sprang forth, and through the shoulder, from above,"
8620,BOOK XI.,Deiopites wounded: Thoon next
8621,BOOK XI.,"He slew, and Ennomus; then with his spear"
8622,BOOK XI.,"Chersidamas, in act to quit his car,"
8623,BOOK XI.,Thrust through the loins below his bossy shield:
8624,BOOK XI.,"Prone in the dust, he clutch’d the blood-stain’d soil."
8625,BOOK XI.,From these he turn’d; and wounded with his spear
8626,BOOK XI.,"Charops, the high-born Socus’ brother, son"
8627,BOOK XI.,"Of Hippasus; then forward sprang, to aid"
8628,BOOK XI.,"His brother, godlike Socus; close he stood"
8629,BOOK XI.,"Before Ulysses, and address’d him thus:"
8630,BOOK XI.,"“Far-fam’d Ulysses, as in arms, in wiles"
8631,BOOK XI.,"Unwearied, thou this day o’er both the sons"
8632,BOOK XI.,"Of Hippasus, two mighty warriors slain,"
8633,BOOK XI.,"And of their armour spoil’d, shalt make thy boast,"
8634,BOOK XI.,Or by my spear thyself shalt lose thy life.”
8635,BOOK XI.,"He said, and on the shield’s broad circle struck:"
8636,BOOK XI.,"Through the bright shield the sturdy weapon drove,"
8637,BOOK XI.,"And through the rich-wrought baldrick, from the ribs"
8638,BOOK XI.,"Tearing the flesh away; but Pallas seiz’d,"
8639,BOOK XI.,And turn’d it from the vital parts aside.
8640,BOOK XI.,"The wound, Ulysses knew, was not to death,"
8641,BOOK XI.,"And back he drew, and thus to Socus cried:"
8642,BOOK XI.,
8643,BOOK XI.,“Ill-fated thou! thy doom hath found thee now;
8644,BOOK XI.,Me hast thou hinder’d from the war awhile;
8645,BOOK XI.,"But thee to swift destruction and dark death,"
8646,BOOK XI.,"This day I doom: great glory, of thee subdued,"
8647,BOOK XI.,"Shall I obtain, and Hades take thy soul.”"
8648,BOOK XI.,
8649,BOOK XI.,"Thus he: and Socus, turning, sought to fly;"
8650,BOOK XI.,"But as he turn’d him round, Ulysses’ spear"
8651,BOOK XI.,"Behind his neck, between the shoulder blades"
8652,BOOK XI.,"Was driv’n, and through his chest; thund’ring he fell,"
8653,BOOK XI.,"And o’er his fall Ulysses, vaunting, thus:"
8654,BOOK XI.,
8655,BOOK XI.,"“Socus, thou son of warlike Hippasus,"
8656,BOOK XI.,"Here hast thou found, nor couldst escape, thy doom."
8657,BOOK XI.,Ill-fated thou! nor sire’s nor mother’s hand
8658,BOOK XI.,"Shall gather up thy bones, but carrion birds"
8659,BOOK XI.,"O’er thee shall flap their baleful wings, and tear"
8660,BOOK XI.,"Thy mangled flesh; for me, whene’er I die"
8661,BOOK XI.,The sons of Greece will build my fun’ral pile.”
8662,BOOK XI.,"From out his flesh, and from the bossy shield,"
8663,BOOK XI.,"The spear of Socus, as he spoke, he drew;"
8664,BOOK XI.,"And as he drew it forth, out gush’d his blood,"
8665,BOOK XI.,"With anguish keen. The Trojans, when they saw"
8666,BOOK XI.,"Ulysses’ blood, with clam’rous shouts advanc’d"
8667,BOOK XI.,"Promiscuous; he, retiring, shouted loud"
8668,BOOK XI.,To call his comrades; loud as head of man
8669,BOOK XI.,"Could bear, he shouted thrice; and thrice his shout"
8670,BOOK XI.,"The warlike Menelaus heard, and thus"
8671,BOOK XI.,"To Ajax, standing by his side, he spoke:"
8672,BOOK XI.,
8673,BOOK XI.,"“Ajax, thou Heav’n-born son of Telamon,"
8674,BOOK XI.,"Great chief of men, methinks I hear the voice"
8675,BOOK XI.,"Of stout Ulysses, as though left alone,"
8676,BOOK XI.,"And in the stubborn fight cut off from aid,"
8677,BOOK XI.,"By Trojans overmaster’d. Haste we then,"
8678,BOOK XI.,"For so ’twere best, to give him present aid."
8679,BOOK XI.,"Brave though he be, yet left alone, I fear"
8680,BOOK XI.,Great cause we Greeks may have to mourn his loss.”
8681,BOOK XI.,
8682,BOOK XI.,"He spoke, and led the way; the godlike chief"
8683,BOOK XI.,"Follow’d his steps: Ulysses, dear to Jove,"
8684,BOOK XI.,"Surrounded by the Trojan host they found,"
8685,BOOK XI.,As hungry jackals on the mountain side
8686,BOOK XI.,"Around a stag, that from an archer’s hand"
8687,BOOK XI.,"Hath taken hurt, yet while his blood was warm"
8688,BOOK XI.,"And limbs yet serv’d, has baffled his pursuit;"
8689,BOOK XI.,"But when the fatal shaft has drain’d his strength,"
8690,BOOK XI.,"Thirsting for blood, beneath the forest shade,"
8691,BOOK XI.,The jackals seize their victim; then if chance
8692,BOOK XI.,"A hungry lion pass, the jackals shrink"
8693,BOOK XI.,"In terror back, while he devours the prey;"
8694,BOOK XI.,"So round Ulysses, sage in council, press’d"
8695,BOOK XI.,"The Trojans, many and brave, yet nobly he"
8696,BOOK XI.,"Averted, spear in hand, the fatal hour;"
8697,BOOK XI.,"Till, with his tow’r-like shield before him borne,"
8698,BOOK XI.,"Appear’d great Ajax, and beside him stood."
8699,BOOK XI.,Hither and thither then the Trojans fled;
8700,BOOK XI.,While with supporting arm from out the crowd
8701,BOOK XI.,"The warlike Menelaus led him forth,"
8702,BOOK XI.,Till his attendant with his car drew near.
8703,BOOK XI.,"Then Ajax, on the Trojans springing, slew"
8704,BOOK XI.,"Doryclus, royal Priam’s bastard son;"
8705,BOOK XI.,"Next Pyrasus he smote, and Pandocus,"
8706,BOOK XI.,"Lysander, and Pylartes; as a stream,"
8707,BOOK XI.,"Swoll’n by the rains of Heav’n, that from the hills"
8708,BOOK XI.,Pours down its wintry torrent on the plain;
8709,BOOK XI.,"And many a blighted oak, and many a pine"
8710,BOOK XI.,"It bears, with piles of drift-wood, to the sea"
8711,BOOK XI.,"So swept illustrious Ajax o’er the plain,"
8712,BOOK XI.,O’erthrowing men and horses; though unknown
8713,BOOK XI.,"To Hector; he, upon Scamander’s banks"
8714,BOOK XI.,"Was warring on the field’s extremest left,"
8715,BOOK XI.,Where round great Nestor and the warlike King
8716,BOOK XI.,"Idomeneus, while men were falling fast,"
8717,BOOK XI.,"Rose, irrepressible, the battle cry."
8718,BOOK XI.,"Hector, ’mid these, was working wondrous deeds,"
8719,BOOK XI.,"With spear and car, routing th’ opposed youth;"
8720,BOOK XI.,"Yet had the Greeks ev’n so their ground maintain’d,"
8721,BOOK XI.,"But godlike Paris, fair-hair’d Helen’s Lord,"
8722,BOOK XI.,"Through the right shoulder, with a three-barb’d shaft,"
8723,BOOK XI.,"As in the front he fought, Machaon quell’d:"
8724,BOOK XI.,For him the warrior Greeks were sore afraid
8725,BOOK XI.,"Lest he, as back the line of battle roll’d,"
8726,BOOK XI.,Might to the foe be left; to Nestor then
8727,BOOK XI.,"Idomeneus address’d his speech, and said:"
8728,BOOK XI.,
8729,BOOK XI.,"“O Nestor, son of Neleus, pride of Greece,"
8730,BOOK XI.,"Haste thee to mount thy car, and with thee take"
8731,BOOK XI.,Machaon; tow’rd the vessels urge with speed
8732,BOOK XI.,"The flying steeds; worth many a life is his,"
8733,BOOK XI.,"The skilful leech, who knows, with practis’d hand,"
8734,BOOK XI.,"T’ extract the shaft, and healing drugs apply.”"
8735,BOOK XI.,
8736,BOOK XI.,He said: Gerenian Nestor at the word
8737,BOOK XI.,"Mounted his car, Machaon at his side,"
8738,BOOK XI.,"The skilful leech, sage Æsculapius’ son:"
8739,BOOK XI.,"He touch’d his horses; tow’rd the Grecian ships,"
8740,BOOK XI.,"As was his purpose, nothing loth, they flew."
8741,BOOK XI.,
8742,BOOK XI.,"To Hector then Cebriones, who saw"
8743,BOOK XI.,"Confus’d the Trojans’ right, drew near, and said:"
8744,BOOK XI.,
8745,BOOK XI.,"“Hector, we here, on th’ outskirts of the field,"
8746,BOOK XI.,"O’erpow’r the Greeks; on th’ other side, our friends"
8747,BOOK XI.,"In strange confusion mingled, horse and man,"
8748,BOOK XI.,"Are driv’n; among them Ajax spreads dismay,"
8749,BOOK XI.,"The son of Telamon; I know him well,"
8750,BOOK XI.,And the broad shield that o’er his shoulders hangs;
8751,BOOK XI.,"Thither direct we then our car, where most"
8752,BOOK XI.,"In mutual slaughter horse and foot engage,"
8753,BOOK XI.,"And loudest swells, uncheck’d, the battle cry.”"
8754,BOOK XI.,
8755,BOOK XI.,"He said, and with the pliant lash he touch’d"
8756,BOOK XI.,"The sleek-skinn’d horses; springing at the sound,"
8757,BOOK XI.,"Between the Greeks and Trojans, light they bore"
8758,BOOK XI.,"The flying car, o’er bodies of the slain"
8759,BOOK XI.,And broken bucklers trampling; all beneath
8760,BOOK XI.,"Was plash’d with blood the axle, and the rails"
8761,BOOK XI.,"Around the car, as from the horses’ feet,"
8762,BOOK XI.,"And from the felloes of the wheels, were thrown"
8763,BOOK XI.,"The bloody gouts; yet on he sped, to join"
8764,BOOK XI.,"The strife of men, and break th’ opposing ranks."
8765,BOOK XI.,"His coming spread confusion ’mid the Greeks,"
8766,BOOK XI.,"His spear awhile withheld; then through the rest,"
8767,BOOK XI.,"With sword, and spear, and pond’rous stones he rush’d,"
8768,BOOK XI.,But shunn’d the might of Ajax Telamon.
8769,BOOK XI.,
8770,BOOK XI.,"But Jove, high thron’d, the soul of Ajax fill’d"
8771,BOOK XI.,With fear; aghast he stood; his sev’nfold shield
8772,BOOK XI.,"He threw behind his back, and, trembling, gaz’d"
8773,BOOK XI.,"Upon the crowd; then, like some beast of prey,"
8774,BOOK XI.,"Foot slowly following foot, reluctant turn’d."
8775,BOOK XI.,As when the rustic youths and dogs have driv’n
8776,BOOK XI.,"A tawny lion from the cattle fold,"
8777,BOOK XI.,"Watching all night, and baulk’d him of his prey;"
8778,BOOK XI.,"Rav’ning for flesh, he still th’ attempt renews,"
8779,BOOK XI.,"But still in vain: for many a jav’lin, hurl’d"
8780,BOOK XI.,"By vig’rous arms, confronts him to his face,"
8781,BOOK XI.,"And blazing faggots, that his courage daunt;"
8782,BOOK XI.,"Till, with the dawn, reluctant he retreat:"
8783,BOOK XI.,"So from before the Trojans Ajax turn’d,"
8784,BOOK XI.,"Reluctant, fearing for the ships of Greece."
8785,BOOK XI.,"As near a field of corn, a stubborn ass,"
8786,BOOK XI.,"Upon whose sides had many a club been broke,"
8787,BOOK XI.,"O’erpow’rs his boyish guides, and ent’ring in,"
8788,BOOK XI.,On the rich forage grazes; while the boys
8789,BOOK XI.,"Their cudgels ply, but vain their puny strength,"
8790,BOOK XI.,"Yet drive him out, when fully fed, with ease:"
8791,BOOK XI.,"Ev’n so great Ajax, son of Telamon,"
8792,BOOK XI.,"The valiant Trojans and their fam’d Allies,"
8793,BOOK XI.,"Still thrusting at his shield, before them drove:"
8794,BOOK XI.,"Yet would he sometimes, rallying, hold in check"
8795,BOOK XI.,"The Trojan host; then turn again to flight,"
8796,BOOK XI.,Yet barring still the passage to the ships.
8797,BOOK XI.,Midway between the Trojans and the Greeks
8798,BOOK XI.,"He stood defiant; many jav’lins, hurl’d"
8799,BOOK XI.,"By vig’rous arms, were in their flight receiv’d"
8800,BOOK XI.,"On his broad shield; and many, ere they reach’d"
8801,BOOK XI.,"Their living mark, fell midway on the plain,"
8802,BOOK XI.,"Fix’d in the ground, in vain athirst for blood."
8803,BOOK XI.,"Him thus, hard press’d by thick-thrown spears, beheld"
8804,BOOK XI.,"Eurypylus, Euaemon’s noble son."
8805,BOOK XI.,"He hasten’d up, and aim’d his glitt’ring spear;"
8806,BOOK XI.,"And Apisaon, Phausias’ noble son,"
8807,BOOK XI.,"Below the midriff through the liver struck,"
8808,BOOK XI.,And straight relax’d in sudden death his limbs.
8809,BOOK XI.,Forth sprang Eurypylus to seize the spoils:
8810,BOOK XI.,"But godlike Paris saw, and as he stoop’d"
8811,BOOK XI.,"From Apisaon’s corpse to strip his arms,"
8812,BOOK XI.,"Against Eurypylus he bent his bow,"
8813,BOOK XI.,And his right thigh transfix’d; the injur’d limb
8814,BOOK XI.,"Disabling, in the wound the arrow broke."
8815,BOOK XI.,"He ’mid his friends, escaping death, withdrew,"
8816,BOOK XI.,And to the Greeks with piercing shout he call’d:
8817,BOOK XI.,
8818,BOOK XI.,"“O friends, the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
8819,BOOK XI.,"Turn yet again, and from the doom of death"
8820,BOOK XI.,"Great Ajax save, hard press’d by hostile spears:"
8821,BOOK XI.,Scarce can I hope he may escape with life
8822,BOOK XI.,"The desp’rate fight; yet bravely stand, and aid"
8823,BOOK XI.,"The mighty Ajax, son of Telamon.”"
8824,BOOK XI.,
8825,BOOK XI.,Thus spoke the wounded hero: round him they
8826,BOOK XI.,With sloping shields and spears uplifted stood:
8827,BOOK XI.,Ajax to meet them came; and when he reach’d
8828,BOOK XI.,"The friendly ranks, again he turn’d to bay."
8829,BOOK XI.,"So rag’d, like blazing fire, the furious fight."
8830,BOOK XI.,
8831,BOOK XI.,"Meanwhile the mares of Neleus, drench’d with sweat,"
8832,BOOK XI.,Bore Nestor and Machaon from the field;
8833,BOOK XI.,"Achilles saw, and mark’d them where he stood"
8834,BOOK XI.,"Upon his lofty vessel’s prow, and watch’d"
8835,BOOK XI.,"The grievous toil, the lamentable rout."
8836,BOOK XI.,Then on his friend Patroclus from the ship
8837,BOOK XI.,"He call’d aloud; he heard his voice, and forth,"
8838,BOOK XI.,"As Mars majestic, from the tent he came:"
8839,BOOK XI.,(That day commenc’d his evil destiny)
8840,BOOK XI.,And thus Menoetius’ noble son began:
8841,BOOK XI.,
8842,BOOK XI.,"“Why call’st thou me? what wouldst thou, Peleus’ son?”"
8843,BOOK XI.,"To whom Achilles, swift of foot, replied:"
8844,BOOK XI.,"“Son of Menoetius, dearest to my soul,"
8845,BOOK XI.,"Soon, must the suppliant Greeks before me kneel,"
8846,BOOK XI.,So insupportable is now their need.
8847,BOOK XI.,"But haste thee now, Patroclus, dear to Jove:"
8848,BOOK XI.,"Enquire of Nestor, from the battle field"
8849,BOOK XI.,Whom brings he wounded: looking from behind
8850,BOOK XI.,"Most like he seem’d to Æsculapius’ son,"
8851,BOOK XI.,"Machaon; but his face I could not see,"
8852,BOOK XI.,So swiftly past the eager horses flew.”
8853,BOOK XI.,
8854,BOOK XI.,"He said: obedient to his friend’s command,"
8855,BOOK XI.,Quick to the tents and ships Patroclus ran.
8856,BOOK XI.,
8857,BOOK XI.,"They, when they reach’d the tent of Neleus’ son,"
8858,BOOK XI.,Descended to the ground; Eurymedon
8859,BOOK XI.,"The old man’s mares unharness’d from the car,"
8860,BOOK XI.,"While on the beach they fac’d the cooling breeze,"
8861,BOOK XI.,"Which from their garments dried the sweat; then turn’d,"
8862,BOOK XI.,And in the tent on easy seats repos’d.
8863,BOOK XI.,For them the fair-hair’d Hecamede mix’d
8864,BOOK XI.,"A cordial potion; her from Tenedos,"
8865,BOOK XI.,"When by Achilles ta’en, the old man brought;"
8866,BOOK XI.,"Daughter of great Arsinous, whom the Greeks"
8867,BOOK XI.,"On him, their sagest councillor, bestow’d."
8868,BOOK XI.,"Before them first a table fair she spread,"
8869,BOOK XI.,"Well polish’d, and with feet of solid bronze;"
8870,BOOK XI.,"On this a brazen canister she plac’d,"
8871,BOOK XI.,"And onions, as a relish to the wine,"
8872,BOOK XI.,"And pale clear honey, and pure barley meal:"
8873,BOOK XI.,"By these a splendid goblet, which from home"
8874,BOOK XI.,"Th’ old man had brought, with golden studs adorn’d:"
8875,BOOK XI.,"Four were its handles, and round each two doves"
8876,BOOK XI.,"Appear’d to feed; at either end, a cup."
8877,BOOK XI.,"Scarce might another move it from the board,"
8878,BOOK XI.,When full; but aged Nestor rais’d with ease.
8879,BOOK XI.,"In this, their goddess-like attendant first"
8880,BOOK XI.,A gen’rous measure mix’d of Pramnian wine:
8881,BOOK XI.,Then with a brazen grater shredded o’er
8882,BOOK XI.,"The goatsmilk cheese, and whitest barley meal,"
8883,BOOK XI.,And of the draught compounded bade them drink.
8884,BOOK XI.,"They drank, and then, reliev’d the parching thirst,"
8885,BOOK XI.,With mutual converse entertain’d the hour.
8886,BOOK XI.,Before the gate divine Patroclus stood:
8887,BOOK XI.,"The old man saw, and from his seat arose,"
8888,BOOK XI.,"And took him by the hand, and led him in,"
8889,BOOK XI.,"And bade him sit; but he, refusing, said:"
8890,BOOK XI.,
8891,BOOK XI.,"“No seat for me, thou venerable sire!"
8892,BOOK XI.,I must not stay; for he both awe and fear
8893,BOOK XI.,"Commands, who hither sent me to enquire"
8894,BOOK XI.,"What wounded man thou hast; I need not ask,"
8895,BOOK XI.,"I know Machaon well, his people’s guard."
8896,BOOK XI.,"My errand done, I must my message bear"
8897,BOOK XI.,"Back to Achilles; and thou know’st thyself,"
8898,BOOK XI.,"Thou venerable sire, how stern his mood:"
8899,BOOK XI.,"Nay sometimes blames he, where no blame is due.”"
8900,BOOK XI.,
8901,BOOK XI.,To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
8902,BOOK XI.,“Whence comes Achilles’ pity for the Greeks
8903,BOOK XI.,By Trojan weapons wounded? knows he not
8904,BOOK XI.,What depth of suff’ring through the camp prevails?
8905,BOOK XI.,"How in the ships, by arrow or by spear"
8906,BOOK XI.,"Sore wounded, all our best and bravest lie?"
8907,BOOK XI.,"The valiant son of Tydeus, Diomed,"
8908,BOOK XI.,"Pierc’d by a shaft; Ulysses by a spear,"
8909,BOOK XI.,And Agamemnon’s self; Eurypylus
8910,BOOK XI.,By a sharp arrow through the thigh transfix’d;
8911,BOOK XI.,"And here another, whom but now I bring,"
8912,BOOK XI.,"Shot by a bow, from off the battle field:"
8913,BOOK XI.,"Achilles, valiant as he is, the while"
8914,BOOK XI.,For Grecian woes nor care nor pity feels.
8915,BOOK XI.,"Waits he, until our ships beside the sea,"
8916,BOOK XI.,"In our despite, are burnt by hostile fires,"
8917,BOOK XI.,And we be singly slain? not mine is now
8918,BOOK XI.,The strength I boasted once of active limbs.
8919,BOOK XI.,"O that such youth and vigour yet were mine,"
8920,BOOK XI.,As when about a cattle-lifting raid
8921,BOOK XI.,We fought th’ Eleans; there Itymoneus
8922,BOOK XI.,"I slew, the son of brave Hyperochus,"
8923,BOOK XI.,Who dwelt in Elis; and my booty drove.
8924,BOOK XI.,He sought to guard the herd; but from my hand
8925,BOOK XI.,A jav’lin struck him in the foremost ranks:
8926,BOOK XI.,"He fell, and terror seiz’d the rustic crowd."
8927,BOOK XI.,Abundant store of plunder from the plain
8928,BOOK XI.,We drove: of horned cattle fifty herds;
8929,BOOK XI.,"As many flocks of sheep, as many droves"
8930,BOOK XI.,"Of swine, as many wide-spread herds of goats,"
8931,BOOK XI.,"And thrice so many golden-chesnut mares,"
8932,BOOK XI.,The foals of many running with their dams.
8933,BOOK XI.,"To Pylos, Neleus’ city, these we drove"
8934,BOOK XI.,"By night; and much it gladden’d Neleus’ heart,"
8935,BOOK XI.,"That I, though new to war, such prize had won."
8936,BOOK XI.,"When morn appear’d, the clear-voic’d heralds call’d"
8937,BOOK XI.,For all to whom from Elis debts were due;
8938,BOOK XI.,"Collected thus, the Pylians’ leading men"
8939,BOOK XI.,Division made: for Elis ow’d us much;
8940,BOOK XI.,Such wrongs we few in Pylos had sustain’d.
8941,BOOK XI.,The might of Hercules in former years
8942,BOOK XI.,"Had storm’d our town, and all our bravest slain."
8943,BOOK XI.,Twelve gallant sons had Neleus; I of these
8944,BOOK XI.,Alone was left; the others all were gone.
8945,BOOK XI.,"Whence over-proud, th’ Epeians treated us"
8946,BOOK XI.,"With insult, and high-handed violence."
8947,BOOK XI.,"A herd of oxen now, and num’rous flock"
8948,BOOK XI.,"Of sheep, th’ old man selected for himself,"
8949,BOOK XI.,"Three hundred, with their shepherds; for to him"
8950,BOOK XI.,Large compensation was from Elis due.
8951,BOOK XI.,"Train’d to the course, four horses, with their cars,"
8952,BOOK XI.,He for the Tripod at th’ Elean games
8953,BOOK XI.,"Had sent to run; these Augeas, King of men,"
8954,BOOK XI.,"Detain’d, and bade the drivers home return,"
8955,BOOK XI.,"Bootless, and grieving for their horses’ loss."
8956,BOOK XI.,"Th’ old man his words resenting, and his acts,"
8957,BOOK XI.,Large spoils retain’d; the rest among the crowd
8958,BOOK XI.,"He shar’d, that none might lose his portion due."
8959,BOOK XI.,"These we dispos’d of soon, and to the Gods"
8960,BOOK XI.,"Due off’rings made; but when the third day rose,"
8961,BOOK XI.,"Back in all haste, in numbers, horse and foot,"
8962,BOOK XI.,"Our foes return’d; with, them the Molion twins,"
8963,BOOK XI.,"Yet boys, untutor’d in the arts of war."
8964,BOOK XI.,"Far off, by Alpheus’ banks, th’ extremest verge"
8965,BOOK XI.,"Of sandy Pylos, is a lofty mound,"
8966,BOOK XI.,"The city of Thryum; which around, intent"
8967,BOOK XI.,"To raze its walls, their army was encamp’d."
8968,BOOK XI.,The plain already they had overspread;
8969,BOOK XI.,When Pallas from Olympus’ heights came down
8970,BOOK XI.,"In haste, and bade us all prepare for war."
8971,BOOK XI.,"On no unwilling ears her message fell,"
8972,BOOK XI.,"But eager all for fight; but me, to arm"
8973,BOOK XI.,"Neleus forbade, and e’en my horses hid,"
8974,BOOK XI.,Deeming me yet unripe for deeds of war.
8975,BOOK XI.,"Yet so, albeit on foot, by Pallas’ grace"
8976,BOOK XI.,A name I gain’d above our noblest horse.
8977,BOOK XI.,"There is a river, Minyis by name,"
8978,BOOK XI.,"Hard by Arene, flowing to the sea,"
8979,BOOK XI.,"Where we, the Pylian horse, expecting morn,"
8980,BOOK XI.,"Encamp’d, by troops of footmen quickly join’d."
8981,BOOK XI.,"Thence in all haste advancing, all in arms,"
8982,BOOK XI.,"We reach’d, by midday, Alpheus’ sacred stream."
8983,BOOK XI.,"There, to o’erruling Jove our off’rings made,"
8984,BOOK XI.,"To Alpheus and to Neptune each a bull,"
8985,BOOK XI.,"To Pallas, blue-ey’d Maid, a heifer fair,"
8986,BOOK XI.,"In order’d ranks we took our ev’ning meal,"
8987,BOOK XI.,And each in arms upon the river’s brink
8988,BOOK XI.,Lay down to rest; for close beside us lay
8989,BOOK XI.,"Th’ Epeians, on the town’s destruction bent."
8990,BOOK XI.,Then saw they mighty deeds of war display’d;
8991,BOOK XI.,"For we, as sunlight overspread the earth,"
8992,BOOK XI.,"To Jove and Pallas praying, battle gave."
8993,BOOK XI.,"But when the Pylians and th’ Epeians met,"
8994,BOOK XI.,"I first a warrior slew, and seiz’d his car,"
8995,BOOK XI.,"Bold spearman, Mulius; Augeas’ son-in-law,"
8996,BOOK XI.,"His eldest daughter’s husband, Agamede,"
8997,BOOK XI.,"The yellow-hair’d, who all the virtues knew"
8998,BOOK XI.,Of each medicinal herb the wide world grows.
8999,BOOK XI.,"Him, with my brass-tipp’d spear, as on he came,"
9000,BOOK XI.,"I slew; he fell; I, rushing to his car,"
9001,BOOK XI.,Stood ’mid the foremost ranks; th’ Epeians brave
9002,BOOK XI.,"Fled diverse, when they saw their champion fall,"
9003,BOOK XI.,"Chief of their horsemen, foremost in the fight."
9004,BOOK XI.,"With the dark whirlwind’s force, I onward rush’d,"
9005,BOOK XI.,And fifty cars I took; two men in each
9006,BOOK XI.,"Fell to my spear, and bit the bloody dust."
9007,BOOK XI.,"Then Actor’s sons, the Molions, had I slain,"
9008,BOOK XI.,"Had not th’ Earth-shaking God, their mighty sire,"
9009,BOOK XI.,"Veil’d in thick cloud, withdrawn them from the field;"
9010,BOOK XI.,Then Jove great glory to the Pylians gave.
9011,BOOK XI.,"For o’er the wide-spread plain we held pursuit,"
9012,BOOK XI.,"Slaying, and gath’ring up the scatter’d arms,"
9013,BOOK XI.,"Nor till corn-clad Buprasium, and the rock"
9014,BOOK XI.,"Olenian, and Alesium, term’d the Mound,"
9015,BOOK XI.,Stay’d we our steeds; there Pallas bade us turn.
9016,BOOK XI.,"There the last man I slew, and left; the Greeks"
9017,BOOK XI.,Back from Buprasium drove their flying cars
9018,BOOK XI.,"To Pylos, magnifying all the name,"
9019,BOOK XI.,"’Mid men, of Nestor, as ’mid Gods, of Jove."
9020,BOOK XI.,"Such once was I ’mid men, while yet I was;"
9021,BOOK XI.,Now to himself alone Achilles keeps
9022,BOOK XI.,"His valour; yet hereafter, when the Greeks"
9023,BOOK XI.,"Have perish’d all, remorse shall touch his soul."
9024,BOOK XI.,"Dear friend, remember now th’ injunctions giv’n"
9025,BOOK XI.,"By old Menoetius, when from Phthian land"
9026,BOOK XI.,He sent thee forth to Agamemnon’s aid:
9027,BOOK XI.,"I, and Laertes’ godlike son, within,"
9028,BOOK XI.,Heard all his counsel; to the well-built house
9029,BOOK XI.,"Of Peleus we on embassy had come,"
9030,BOOK XI.,Throughout Achaia’s fertile lands to raise
9031,BOOK XI.,"The means of war; Menoetius there we found,"
9032,BOOK XI.,"Achilles, and thyself within the house;"
9033,BOOK XI.,"While in the court-yard aged Peleus slew,"
9034,BOOK XI.,And to the Lord of thunder offer’d up
9035,BOOK XI.,A fatten’d steer; and from a golden bowl
9036,BOOK XI.,O’er the burnt-off’ring pour’d the ruddy wine.
9037,BOOK XI.,"We two, while ye were busied with the flesh,"
9038,BOOK XI.,"Stood at the gate; surpris’d, Achilles rose,"
9039,BOOK XI.,"And took us by the hand, and bade us sit,"
9040,BOOK XI.,Dispensing all the hospitable rites.
9041,BOOK XI.,"With food and wine recruited, I began"
9042,BOOK XI.,"My speech, and urg’d ye both to join the war:"
9043,BOOK XI.,Nor were ye loth to go; much sage advice
9044,BOOK XI.,Your elders gave; old Peleus bade his son
9045,BOOK XI.,"To aim at highest honours, and surpass"
9046,BOOK XI.,"His comrades all; Menoetius, Actor’s son,"
9047,BOOK XI.,"To thee this counsel gave: ‘My son,’ he said,"
9048,BOOK XI.,‘Achilles is by birth above thee far;
9049,BOOK XI.,Thou art in years the elder; he in strength
9050,BOOK XI.,Surpasses thee; do thou with prudent words
9051,BOOK XI.,"And timely speech address him, and advise"
9052,BOOK XI.,"And guide him; he will, to his good, obey.’"
9053,BOOK XI.,
9054,BOOK XI.,“Such were the old man’s words; but thou hast let
9055,BOOK XI.,His counsel slip thy mem’ry; yet ev’n now
9056,BOOK XI.,"Speak to Achilles thus, and stir his soul,"
9057,BOOK XI.,If haply he will hear thee; and who knows
9058,BOOK XI.,But by the grace of Heav’n thou mayst prevail?
9059,BOOK XI.,For great is oft a friend’s persuasive pow’r.
9060,BOOK XI.,"But if the fear of evil prophesied,"
9061,BOOK XI.,Or message by his Goddess-mother brought
9062,BOOK XI.,"From Jove, restrain him, let him send thee forth"
9063,BOOK XI.,"With all his force of warlike Myrmidons,"
9064,BOOK XI.,That thou mayst be the saving light of Greece.
9065,BOOK XI.,Then let him bid thee to the battle bear
9066,BOOK XI.,"His glitt’ring arms; if so the men of Troy,"
9067,BOOK XI.,"Scar’d by his likeness, may forsake the field,"
9068,BOOK XI.,"And breathing-time afford the sons of Greece,"
9069,BOOK XI.,Toil-worn; for little pause has yet been theirs.
9070,BOOK XI.,"Fresh and unwearied, ye with ease may drive"
9071,BOOK XI.,"To their own city, from our ships and tents,"
9072,BOOK XI.,"The Trojans, worn and battle-wearied men.”"
9073,BOOK XI.,
9074,BOOK XI.,"Thus he; Patroclus’ spirit within him burn’d,"
9075,BOOK XI.,And tow’rd Achilles’ tent in haste he sped.
9076,BOOK XI.,"But, running, as Ulysses’ ship he pass’d,"
9077,BOOK XI.,"Where was the Council and the Justice-seat,"
9078,BOOK XI.,"And where were built the altars of the Gods,"
9079,BOOK XI.,"There met him, halting from the battle-field,"
9080,BOOK XI.,"Shot through the thigh, Euaemon’s Heav’n-born son,"
9081,BOOK XI.,Eurypylus; his head and shoulders dank
9082,BOOK XI.,"With clammy sweat, while from his grievous wound"
9083,BOOK XI.,Stream’d the dark blood; yet firm was still his soul.
9084,BOOK XI.,"Menoetius’ noble son with pity saw,"
9085,BOOK XI.,And deeply sorrowing thus address’d the chief:
9086,BOOK XI.,
9087,BOOK XI.,“Woe for the chiefs and councillors of Greece!
9088,BOOK XI.,"And must ye, far from friends and native home,"
9089,BOOK XI.,Glut with your flesh the rav’ning dogs of Troy?
9090,BOOK XI.,"Yet tell me this, Heav’n-born Eurypylus;"
9091,BOOK XI.,Still do the Greeks ’gainst Hector’s giant force
9092,BOOK XI.,"Make head? or fall they, vanquish’d by his spear?”"
9093,BOOK XI.,
9094,BOOK XI.,"To whom with prudent speech, Eurypylus:"
9095,BOOK XI.,"“No source, Heav’n-born Patroclus, have the Greeks,"
9096,BOOK XI.,"Of aid, but all must perish by their ships:"
9097,BOOK XI.,"For in the ships lie all our bravest late,"
9098,BOOK XI.,"By spear or arrow struck, by Trojan hands;"
9099,BOOK XI.,"And fiercer, hour by hour, their onset grows."
9100,BOOK XI.,"But save me now, and lead me to the ships;"
9101,BOOK XI.,"There cut the arrow out, and from the wound"
9102,BOOK XI.,With tepid water cleanse the clotted blood:
9103,BOOK XI.,"Then soothing drugs apply, of healing pow’r,"
9104,BOOK XI.,"Which from Achilles, thou, ’tis said, hast learn’d,"
9105,BOOK XI.,"From Chiron, justest of the Centaurs, he."
9106,BOOK XI.,"For Podalirius and Machaon both,"
9107,BOOK XI.,"Our leeches, one lies wounded in the tents,"
9108,BOOK XI.,Himself requiring sore the leech’s aid;
9109,BOOK XI.,The other on the plain still dares the fight.”
9110,BOOK XI.,
9111,BOOK XI.,To whom again Menoetius’ noble son:
9112,BOOK XI.,"“How may this be? say, brave Eurypylus,"
9113,BOOK XI.,"What must I do? a messenger am I,"
9114,BOOK XI.,"Sent by Gerenian Nestor, prop of Greece,"
9115,BOOK XI.,With tidings to Achilles; yet ev’n so
9116,BOOK XI.,I will not leave thee in this weary plight.”
9117,BOOK XI.,
9118,BOOK XI.,"He said, and passing his supporting hand"
9119,BOOK XI.,"Beneath his breast, the wounded warrior led"
9120,BOOK XI.,"Within the tent; th’ attendant saw, and spread"
9121,BOOK XI.,"The ox-hide couch; then as he lay reclin’d,"
9122,BOOK XI.,"Patroclus, with his dagger, from the thigh"
9123,BOOK XI.,Cut out the biting shaft; and from the wound
9124,BOOK XI.,With tepid water cleans’d the clotted blood;
9125,BOOK XI.,"Then, pounded in his hands, a root applied"
9126,BOOK XI.,"Astringent, anodyne, which all his pain"
9127,BOOK XI.,"Allay’d; the wound was dried, and stanch’d the blood."

9151,BOOK XII.,Thus o’er the wounded chief Eurypylus
9152,BOOK XII.,Watch’d in his tent Menoetius’ noble son;
9153,BOOK XII.,But hand to hand the Greeks and Trojans fought;
9154,BOOK XII.,"Nor longer might the ditch th’ assault repel,"
9155,BOOK XII.,"Nor the broad wall above, which Greeks had built,"
9156,BOOK XII.,"To guard their ships, and round it dug the ditch;"
9157,BOOK XII.,"But to the Gods no hecatombs had paid,"
9158,BOOK XII.,That they the ships and all the stores within
9159,BOOK XII.,Might safely keep; against the will of Heav’n
9160,BOOK XII.,"The work was done, and thence not long endur’d."
9161,BOOK XII.,"While Hector liv’d, and Peleus’ son his wrath"
9162,BOOK XII.,"Retain’d, and Priam’s city untaken stood;"
9163,BOOK XII.,So long the Grecian wall remain’d entire:
9164,BOOK XII.,"But of the Trojans when the best had fall’n,"
9165,BOOK XII.,"Of Greeks, when some were slain, some yet surviv’d;"
9166,BOOK XII.,"When the tenth year had seen the fall of Troy,"
9167,BOOK XII.,"And Greeks, embark’d, had ta’en their homeward way,"
9168,BOOK XII.,Then Neptune and Apollo counsel took
9169,BOOK XII.,To sap the wall by aid of all the streams
9170,BOOK XII.,That seaward from the heights of Ida flow;
9171,BOOK XII.,"Rhesus, Caresus, and Heptaporus,"
9172,BOOK XII.,"Granicus, and Æsepus, Rhodius,"
9173,BOOK XII.,"Scamander’s stream divine, and Simois,"
9174,BOOK XII.,"Where helms and shields lay buried in the sand,"
9175,BOOK XII.,And a whole race of warrior demigods:
9176,BOOK XII.,These all Apollo to one channel turn’d;
9177,BOOK XII.,Nine days against the wall the torrent beat;
9178,BOOK XII.,"And Jove sent rain continuous, that the wall"
9179,BOOK XII.,"Might sooner be submerg’d; while Neptune’s self,"
9180,BOOK XII.,"His trident in his hand, led on the stream,"
9181,BOOK XII.,"Washing away the deep foundations, laid,"
9182,BOOK XII.,"Laborious, by the Greeks, with logs and stones,"
9183,BOOK XII.,Now by fast-flowing Hellespont dispers’d.
9184,BOOK XII.,"The wall destroy’d, o’er all the shore he spread"
9185,BOOK XII.,A sandy drift; and bade the streams return
9186,BOOK XII.,To where of old their silver waters flow’d.
9187,BOOK XII.,"Such were, in future days, to be the works"
9188,BOOK XII.,Of Neptune and Apollo; but meanwhile
9189,BOOK XII.,"Fierce rag’d the battle round the firm-built wall,"
9190,BOOK XII.,And frequent clatter’d on the turrets’ beams
9191,BOOK XII.,The hostile missiles: by the scourge of Jove
9192,BOOK XII.,"Subdued, the Greeks beside their ships were hemm’d,"
9193,BOOK XII.,"By Hector scar’d, fell minister of Dread,"
9194,BOOK XII.,"Who with the whirlwind’s force, as ever, fought."
9195,BOOK XII.,"As when, by dogs and hunters circled round,"
9196,BOOK XII.,"A boar, or lion, in his pride of strength,"
9197,BOOK XII.,"Turns on his foes, while they in close array"
9198,BOOK XII.,"Stand opposite, and frequent shoot their darts;"
9199,BOOK XII.,"Nor yet his spirit quails, but firm he stands"
9200,BOOK XII.,"With suicidal courage; swift he turns,"
9201,BOOK XII.,Where best to break the circling ranks; where’er
9202,BOOK XII.,"He makes his rush, the circling ranks give way:"
9203,BOOK XII.,"So Hector, here and there, amid the crowd,"
9204,BOOK XII.,Urg’d his companions on to cross the ditch:
9205,BOOK XII.,"The fiery steeds shrank back, and, snorting, stood"
9206,BOOK XII.,Upon the topmost brink; for the wide ditch
9207,BOOK XII.,"Withheld them, easy nor to leap nor cross:"
9208,BOOK XII.,"For steep arose on either side the banks,"
9209,BOOK XII.,"And at the top with sharpen’d stakes were crown’d,"
9210,BOOK XII.,"Thick-set and strong, which there the sons of Greece"
9211,BOOK XII.,"Had planted, to repel th’ invading foes."
9212,BOOK XII.,"Scarce might a horse, with well-wheel’d car attach’d,"
9213,BOOK XII.,Essay the passage; but on foot they burn’d
9214,BOOK XII.,"To make th’ attempt; and thus Polydamas,"
9215,BOOK XII.,"Approaching near, to valiant Hector spoke:"
9216,BOOK XII.,
9217,BOOK XII.,"“Hector, and all ye other chiefs of Troy,"
9218,BOOK XII.,"And brave Allies, in vain we seek to drive"
9219,BOOK XII.,Our horses o’er the ditch; ’tis hard to cross;
9220,BOOK XII.,"’Tis crown’d with pointed stakes, and them behind"
9221,BOOK XII.,Is built the Grecian wall; there to descend
9222,BOOK XII.,And from our cars in narrow space to fight
9223,BOOK XII.,Were certain ruin. If it be indeed
9224,BOOK XII.,"The will of Jove, high-thund’ring, to confound"
9225,BOOK XII.,"The Greeks in utter rout, and us to aid,"
9226,BOOK XII.,I should rejoice that ev’ry Greek forthwith
9227,BOOK XII.,Far from his home should fill a nameless grave;
9228,BOOK XII.,"But should they turn, and we again be driv’n"
9229,BOOK XII.,"Back from the ships, and hurried down the ditch,"
9230,BOOK XII.,"Such were our loss, that scarce a messenger"
9231,BOOK XII.,Would live to bear the tidings to the town
9232,BOOK XII.,Of our destruction by the rallied Greeks.
9233,BOOK XII.,Hear then my counsel; let us all agree
9234,BOOK XII.,With our attendants here upon the bank
9235,BOOK XII.,"To leave our horses; and ourselves on foot,"
9236,BOOK XII.,"All arm’d, press on where Hector leads; the Greeks,"
9237,BOOK XII.,"If that their doom be nigh, will make no stand.”"
9238,BOOK XII.,
9239,BOOK XII.,Thus spoke Polydamas; his counsel pleas’d;
9240,BOOK XII.,"And Hector sprang, in arms, from off his car;"
9241,BOOK XII.,"Nor long, the noble Hector when they saw,"
9242,BOOK XII.,Delay’d the other chiefs; then gave command
9243,BOOK XII.,"Each to his own attendant, by the ditch"
9244,BOOK XII.,To keep the chariots all in due array;
9245,BOOK XII.,"Then parting, form’d in order of attack,"
9246,BOOK XII.,"In five divisions, with their sev’ral chiefs."
9247,BOOK XII.,"Round Hector throng’d, and bold Polydamas,"
9248,BOOK XII.,The best and bravest; they who long’d the most
9249,BOOK XII.,"To storm the wall, and fight beside the ships."
9250,BOOK XII.,"With them Cebriones; for Hector left,"
9251,BOOK XII.,"To guard the horses, one of lesser note."
9252,BOOK XII.,"The next division was by Paris led,"
9253,BOOK XII.,"Agenor, and Alcathous; the third"
9254,BOOK XII.,"By Helenus, and brave Deiphobus,"
9255,BOOK XII.,"Two sons of Priam; Asius was the third,"
9256,BOOK XII.,"Asius, the son of Hyrtacus; who brought"
9257,BOOK XII.,"His tow’ring fiery steeds from Selles’ stream,"
9258,BOOK XII.,Hard by Arisba; stout Æneas led
9259,BOOK XII.,"The fourth, Anchises’ son, Archilochus"
9260,BOOK XII.,"With him, and Acamas, Antenor’s sons;"
9261,BOOK XII.,Both skill’d alike in ev’ry point of war.
9262,BOOK XII.,"Of the far-fam’d Allies, Sarpedon held"
9263,BOOK XII.,The chief command; and for his comrades chose
9264,BOOK XII.,"Asteropaeus, and the warlike might"
9265,BOOK XII.,Of Glaucus; these o’er all the rest he held
9266,BOOK XII.,"Pre-eminent in valour, save himself,"
9267,BOOK XII.,Who o’er them all superior stood confess’d.
9268,BOOK XII.,"These, interlac’d their shields of tough bull’s-hide,"
9269,BOOK XII.,"With eager step advanc’d, and deem’d the Greeks"
9270,BOOK XII.,"Would, unresisting, fall before their ships."
9271,BOOK XII.,The other Trojans and renown’d Allies
9272,BOOK XII.,The words of wise Polydamas obey’d:
9273,BOOK XII.,"But Asius, son of Hyrtacus, refus’d"
9274,BOOK XII.,"His horses and his charioteer to leave,"
9275,BOOK XII.,With them advancing to assail the ships.
9276,BOOK XII.,"Blind fool, unconscious! from before those ships,"
9277,BOOK XII.,"Escap’d from death, with horses and with car"
9278,BOOK XII.,"Triumphant, to the breezy heights of Troy"
9279,BOOK XII.,He never shall return; ill-omen’d fate
9280,BOOK XII.,"O’ershadowing, dooms him by the spear to fall"
9281,BOOK XII.,"Of brave Idomeneus, Deucalion’s son."
9282,BOOK XII.,"He tow’rd the left inclin’d, what way the Greeks"
9283,BOOK XII.,With horse and chariot from the plain return’d.
9284,BOOK XII.,That way he drove his horses; and the gates
9285,BOOK XII.,Unguarded found by bolt or massive bar.
9286,BOOK XII.,"Their warders held them open’d wide, to save"
9287,BOOK XII.,"Perchance some comrade, flying from the plain."
9288,BOOK XII.,Thither he bent his course; with clamours loud
9289,BOOK XII.,Follow’d his troops; nor deem’d they that the Greeks
9290,BOOK XII.,"Would hold their ground, but fall amid their ships."
9291,BOOK XII.,Little they knew; before the gates they found
9292,BOOK XII.,"Two men, two warriors of the prime, two sons"
9293,BOOK XII.,Illustrious of the spear-skill’d Lapithae:
9294,BOOK XII.,"Stout Polypoetes one, Pirithous’ son,"
9295,BOOK XII.,"With whom Leonteus, bold as blood-stain’d Mars:"
9296,BOOK XII.,"So stood these two before the lofty gates,"
9297,BOOK XII.,"As on the mountain side two tow’ring oaks,"
9298,BOOK XII.,"Which many a day have borne the wind and storm,"
9299,BOOK XII.,Firm rifted by their strong continuous roots:
9300,BOOK XII.,So in their arms and vigour confident
9301,BOOK XII.,"Those two great Asius’ charge, undaunted, met."
9302,BOOK XII.,"On th’ other side, with, shouts and wild uproar,"
9303,BOOK XII.,"Their bull’s-hide shields uplifted high, advanc’d"
9304,BOOK XII.,"Against the well-built wall, Asius the King,"
9305,BOOK XII.,"Iamenus, Orestes, Acamas"
9306,BOOK XII.,"The son of Asius, and Œnomaus,"
9307,BOOK XII.,And Thoon; those within to save the ships
9308,BOOK XII.,Calling meanwhile on all the well-greav’d Greeks;
9309,BOOK XII.,"But when they saw the wall by Trojans scal’d,"
9310,BOOK XII.,"And heard the cry of Greeks in panic fear,"
9311,BOOK XII.,"Sprang forth those two, before the gates to fight."
9312,BOOK XII.,"As when two boars, upon the mountain side,"
9313,BOOK XII.,"Await th’ approaching din of men and dogs,"
9314,BOOK XII.,"Then sideways rushing, snap the wood around,"
9315,BOOK XII.,"Ripp’d from the roots; loud clash their clatt’ring tusks,"
9316,BOOK XII.,Till to the huntsman’s spear they yield their lives;
9317,BOOK XII.,So clatter’d on those champions’ brass-clad breasts
9318,BOOK XII.,"The hostile weapons; stubbornly they fought,"
9319,BOOK XII.,"Relying on their strength, and friends above:"
9320,BOOK XII.,For from the well-built tow’rs huge stones were hurl’d
9321,BOOK XII.,"By those who for themselves, their tents and ships,"
9322,BOOK XII.,"Maintain’d defensive warfare; thick they fell,"
9323,BOOK XII.,"As wintry snow-flakes, which the boist’rous wind,"
9324,BOOK XII.,"Driving the shadowy clouds, spreads fast and close"
9325,BOOK XII.,O’er all the surface of the fertile earth:
9326,BOOK XII.,"So thick, from Grecian and from Trojan hands,"
9327,BOOK XII.,The weapons flew; on helm and bossy shield
9328,BOOK XII.,With grating sound the pond’rous masses rang.
9329,BOOK XII.,"Then deeply groaning, as he smote his thigh"
9330,BOOK XII.,Thus spoke dismay’d the son of Hyrtacus:
9331,BOOK XII.,"“O Father Jove, how hast thou lov’d our hopes"
9332,BOOK XII.,"To falsify, who deem’d not that the Greeks"
9333,BOOK XII.,"Would stand our onset, and resistless arms!"
9334,BOOK XII.,"But they, as yellow-banded wasps, or bees,"
9335,BOOK XII.,"That by some rocky pass have built their nests,"
9336,BOOK XII.,"Abandon not their cavern’d home, but wait"
9337,BOOK XII.,"Th’ attack, and boldly for their offspring fight;"
9338,BOOK XII.,"So from the gates these two, though two alone,"
9339,BOOK XII.,"Retire not, till they be or ta’en or slain.”"
9340,BOOK XII.,
9341,BOOK XII.,He said: but Jove regarded not his words;
9342,BOOK XII.,So much on Hector’s triumph he was bent.
9343,BOOK XII.,Like battle rag’d round th’ other gates; but hard
9344,BOOK XII.,"It were for me, with godlike pow’r, to paint"
9345,BOOK XII.,Each sev’ral combat; for around the wall
9346,BOOK XII.,A more than human storm of stone was pour’d
9347,BOOK XII.,"On ev’ry side; the Greeks, hard press’d, perforce"
9348,BOOK XII.,"Fought for their ships, while all the Gods look’d on"
9349,BOOK XII.,"Indignant, who the Grecian cause upheld."
9350,BOOK XII.,Fiercely the Lapithae sustain’d the war:
9351,BOOK XII.,"Stout Polypoetes first, Pirithous’ son,"
9352,BOOK XII.,"Smote, through the brass-cheek’d helmet, Damasus;"
9353,BOOK XII.,"Nor stay’d the brazen helm the spear, whose point"
9354,BOOK XII.,"Went crashing through the bone, that all the brain"
9355,BOOK XII.,"Was shatter’d; onward as he rush’d, he fell."
9356,BOOK XII.,"Then Pylon next, and Ormenus he slew:"
9357,BOOK XII.,"Meantime Leonteus, scion true of Mars,"
9358,BOOK XII.,"Struck with unerring spear Hippomachus,"
9359,BOOK XII.,"Son of Antimachus, below the waist;"
9360,BOOK XII.,"Then, drawing from the sheath his trenchant sword,"
9361,BOOK XII.,"Dash’d through the crowd, and hand to hand he smote"
9362,BOOK XII.,"Antiphates; he, backward, fell to earth."
9363,BOOK XII.,"Menon, Iamenus, Orestes next,"
9364,BOOK XII.,In quick succession to the ground he brought.
9365,BOOK XII.,"From these while they their glitt’ring armour stripp’d,"
9366,BOOK XII.,"Round Hector throng’d, and bold Polydamas,"
9367,BOOK XII.,"The bravest and the best, who long’d the most"
9368,BOOK XII.,"To storm the wall, and burn with fire the ships."
9369,BOOK XII.,Yet on the margin of the ditch they paus’d;
9370,BOOK XII.,"For, as they sought to cross, a sign from Heav’n"
9371,BOOK XII.,"Appear’d, to leftward of th’ astonish’d crowd;"
9372,BOOK XII.,A soaring eagle in his talons bore
9373,BOOK XII.,"A dragon, huge of size, of blood-red hue,"
9374,BOOK XII.,"Alive, and breathing still, nor yet subdued;"
9375,BOOK XII.,For twisting backward through the breast he pierc’d
9376,BOOK XII.,"His bearer, near the neck; he, stung with pain,"
9377,BOOK XII.,"Let fall his prey, which dropp’d amid the crowd;"
9378,BOOK XII.,"Then screaming, on the blast was borne away."
9379,BOOK XII.,"The Trojans, shudd’ring, in their midst beheld"
9380,BOOK XII.,"The spotted serpent, dire portent of Jove:"
9381,BOOK XII.,Then to bold Hector thus Polydamas:
9382,BOOK XII.,"“Hector, in council thou reprov’st me oft"
9383,BOOK XII.,"For good advice; it is not meet, thou say’st,"
9384,BOOK XII.,"That private men should talk beside the mark,"
9385,BOOK XII.,"In council or in war, but study still"
9386,BOOK XII.,Thine honour to exalt; yet must I now
9387,BOOK XII.,Declare what seems to me the wisest course:
9388,BOOK XII.,Let us not fight the Greeks beside their ships;
9389,BOOK XII.,"For thus I read the future, if indeed"
9390,BOOK XII.,"To us, about to cross, this sign from Heav’n"
9391,BOOK XII.,"Was sent, to leftward of th’ astonish’d crowd:"
9392,BOOK XII.,"A soaring eagle, bearing in his claws"
9393,BOOK XII.,"A dragon, huge of size, of blood-red hue,"
9394,BOOK XII.,"Alive; yet dropp’d him ere he reach’d his home,"
9395,BOOK XII.,Nor to his nestlings bore th’ intended prey:
9396,BOOK XII.,"So we, e’en though our mighty strength should break"
9397,BOOK XII.,"The gates and wall, and put the Greeks to rout,"
9398,BOOK XII.,"By the same road not scatheless should return,"
9399,BOOK XII.,"But many a Trojan on the field should leave,"
9400,BOOK XII.,"Slain by the Greeks, while they their ships defend."
9401,BOOK XII.,"So would a seer, well vers’d in augury,"
9402,BOOK XII.,"Worthy of public credit, read this sign.”"
9403,BOOK XII.,
9404,BOOK XII.,To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm
9405,BOOK XII.,"Replied, with stern regard: “Polydamas,"
9406,BOOK XII.,This speech of thine is alien to my soul:
9407,BOOK XII.,Thy better judgment better counsel knows.
9408,BOOK XII.,"But if in earnest such is thine advice,"
9409,BOOK XII.,"Thee of thy senses have the Gods bereft,"
9410,BOOK XII.,Who fain wouldst have us disregard the word
9411,BOOK XII.,"And promise by the nod of Jove confirm’d,"
9412,BOOK XII.,And put our faith in birds’ expanded wings;
9413,BOOK XII.,"Little of these I reck, nor care to look,"
9414,BOOK XII.,"If to the right, and tow’rd the morning sun,"
9415,BOOK XII.,"Or to the left, and shades of night, they fly."
9416,BOOK XII.,"Put we our trust in Jove’s eternal will,"
9417,BOOK XII.,Of mortals and Immortals King supreme.
9418,BOOK XII.,The best of omens is our country’s cause.
9419,BOOK XII.,Why shouldst thou tremble at the battle strife?
9420,BOOK XII.,Though ev’ry Trojan else were doom’d to die
9421,BOOK XII.,"Beside the ships, no fear lest thou shouldst fall:"
9422,BOOK XII.,"Unwarlike is thy soul, nor firm of mood:"
9423,BOOK XII.,"But if thou shrink, or by thy craven words"
9424,BOOK XII.,"Turn back another Trojan from the fight,"
9425,BOOK XII.,My spear shall take the forfeit of thy life.”
9426,BOOK XII.,
9427,BOOK XII.,"This said, he led the way; with joyous shouts"
9428,BOOK XII.,"They follow’d all; then Jove, the lightning’s Lord,"
9429,BOOK XII.,"From Ida’s heights a storm of wind sent down,"
9430,BOOK XII.,Driving the dust against the Grecian ships;
9431,BOOK XII.,"Which quell’d their courage, and to Hector gave,"
9432,BOOK XII.,"And to the Trojans, fresh incitement; they,"
9433,BOOK XII.,"On their own strength, and heav’nly signs relying,"
9434,BOOK XII.,Their force address’d to storm the Grecian wall.
9435,BOOK XII.,"They raz’d the counterscarp, the battlements"
9436,BOOK XII.,"Destroy’d; and the projecting buttresses,"
9437,BOOK XII.,"Which, to sustain the tow’rs, the Greeks had fix’d"
9438,BOOK XII.,"Deep in the soil, with levers undermin’d."
9439,BOOK XII.,"These once withdrawn, they hop’d to storm the wall;"
9440,BOOK XII.,"Nor from the passage yet the Greeks withdrew,"
9441,BOOK XII.,But closely fencing with their bull’s-hide shields
9442,BOOK XII.,"The broken battlements, they thence hurl’d down"
9443,BOOK XII.,A storm of weapons on the foe beneath.
9444,BOOK XII.,Commanding from the tow’r in ev’ry place
9445,BOOK XII.,"Were seen th’ Ajaces, urging to the fight,"
9446,BOOK XII.,"Imploring these, and those in sterner tones"
9447,BOOK XII.,"Rebuking, who their warlike toil relax’d."
9448,BOOK XII.,
9449,BOOK XII.,"“Friends, Grecians all, ye who excel in war,"
9450,BOOK XII.,"And ye of mod’rate or inferior strength,"
9451,BOOK XII.,"Though all are not with equal pow’rs endued,"
9452,BOOK XII.,"Yet here is work for all! bear this in mind,"
9453,BOOK XII.,"Nor tow’rd the ships let any turn his face,"
9454,BOOK XII.,"By threats dismay’d; but forward press, and each"
9455,BOOK XII.,"Encourage each, if so the lightning’s Lord,"
9456,BOOK XII.,"Olympian Jove, may grant us to repel,"
9457,BOOK XII.,And backward to his city chase the foe.”
9458,BOOK XII.,
9459,BOOK XII.,"Thus they, with cheering words, sustain’d the war:"
9460,BOOK XII.,"Thick as the snow-flakes on a wintry day,"
9461,BOOK XII.,"When Jove, the Lord of counsel, down on men"
9462,BOOK XII.,"His snow-storm sends, and manifests his pow’r:"
9463,BOOK XII.,"Hush’d are the winds; the flakes continuous fall,"
9464,BOOK XII.,"That the high mountain tops, and jutting crags,"
9465,BOOK XII.,"And lotus-cover’d meads are buried deep,"
9466,BOOK XII.,And man’s productive labours of the field;
9467,BOOK XII.,"On hoary Ocean’s beach and bays they lie,"
9468,BOOK XII.,Th’ approaching waves their bound; o’er all beside
9469,BOOK XII.,Is spread by Jove the heavy veil of snow.
9470,BOOK XII.,"So thickly new the stones from either side,"
9471,BOOK XII.,"By Greeks on Trojans hurl’d, by these on Greeks;"
9472,BOOK XII.,And clatter’d loud through all its length the wall.
9473,BOOK XII.,"Nor yet the Trojans, though by Hector led,"
9474,BOOK XII.,"The gates had broken, and the massive bar,"
9475,BOOK XII.,But Jove against the Greeks sent forth his son
9476,BOOK XII.,"Sarpedon, as a lion on a herd:"
9477,BOOK XII.,"His shield’s broad orb before his breast he bore,"
9478,BOOK XII.,"Well-wrought, of beaten brass, which th’ arm’rer’s hand"
9479,BOOK XII.,"Had beaten out, and lin’d with stout bull’s-hide;"
9480,BOOK XII.,"With golden rods, continuous, all around;"
9481,BOOK XII.,"He thus equipp’d, two jav’lins brandishing,"
9482,BOOK XII.,"Strode onward, as a lion, mountain-bred,"
9483,BOOK XII.,"Whom, fasting long, his dauntless courage leads"
9484,BOOK XII.,"To assail the flock, though in well-guarded fold;"
9485,BOOK XII.,"And though the shepherds there he find, prepar’d"
9486,BOOK XII.,"With dogs and lances to protect the sheep,"
9487,BOOK XII.,Not unattempted will he leave the fold;
9488,BOOK XII.,"But, springing to the midst, he bears his prey"
9489,BOOK XII.,"In triumph thence; or in the onset falls,"
9490,BOOK XII.,Wounded by jav’lins hurl’d by stalwart hands:
9491,BOOK XII.,"So, prompted by his godlike courage, burn’d"
9492,BOOK XII.,"Sarpedon to assail the lofty wall,"
9493,BOOK XII.,"And storm the ramparts; and to Glaucus thus,"
9494,BOOK XII.,"Son of Hippolochus, his speech address’d:"
9495,BOOK XII.,
9496,BOOK XII.,"“Whence is it, Glaucus, that in Lycian land"
9497,BOOK XII.,"We two at feasts the foremost seats may claim,"
9498,BOOK XII.,"The largest portions, and the fullest cups?"
9499,BOOK XII.,Why held as Gods in honour? why endow’d
9500,BOOK XII.,"With ample heritage, by Xanthus’ banks,"
9501,BOOK XII.,"Of vineyard, and of wheat producing land?"
9502,BOOK XII.,Then by the Lycians should we not be seen
9503,BOOK XII.,The foremost to affront the raging fight?
9504,BOOK XII.,So may our well-arm’d Lycians make their boast;
9505,BOOK XII.,‘To no inglorious Kings we Lycians owe
9506,BOOK XII.,Allegiance; they on richest viands feed;
9507,BOOK XII.,Of luscious flavour drink the choicest wine;
9508,BOOK XII.,"But still their valour brightest shows; and they,"
9509,BOOK XII.,"Where Lycians war, are foremost in the fight!’"
9510,BOOK XII.,"O friend! if we, survivors of this war,"
9511,BOOK XII.,"Could live, from age and death for ever free,"
9512,BOOK XII.,"Thou shouldst not see me foremost in the fight,"
9513,BOOK XII.,Nor would I urge thee to the glorious field:
9514,BOOK XII.,But since on man ten thousand forms of death
9515,BOOK XII.,"Attend, which none may ’scape, then on, that we"
9516,BOOK XII.,"May glory on others gain, or they on us!”"
9517,BOOK XII.,
9518,BOOK XII.,Thus he; nor Glaucus from his bidding shrank;
9519,BOOK XII.,And forward straight they led the Lycian pow’rs.
9520,BOOK XII.,"Menestheus, son of Peteus, with dismay"
9521,BOOK XII.,"Observ’d their movement; for on his command,"
9522,BOOK XII.,"Inspiring terror, their attack was made."
9523,BOOK XII.,"He look’d around him to the Grecian tow’rs,"
9524,BOOK XII.,"If any chief might there be found, to save"
9525,BOOK XII.,"His comrades from destruction; there he saw,"
9526,BOOK XII.,"Of war insatiable, th’ Ajaces twain;"
9527,BOOK XII.,"And Teucer, from the tent but newly come,"
9528,BOOK XII.,Hard by; nor yet could reach them with his voice;
9529,BOOK XII.,"Such was the din, such tumult rose to Heav’n,"
9530,BOOK XII.,"From clatt’ring shields, and horsehair-crested helms,"
9531,BOOK XII.,"And batter’d gates, now all at once assail’d:"
9532,BOOK XII.,Before them fiercely strove th’ assaulting bands
9533,BOOK XII.,"To break their way: he then Thootes sent,"
9534,BOOK XII.,"His herald, to th’ Ajaces, craving aid."
9535,BOOK XII.,
9536,BOOK XII.,"“Haste thee, Thootes, on th’ Ajaces call,"
9537,BOOK XII.,"Both, if it may be; so we best may hope"
9538,BOOK XII.,"To ’scape the death, which else is near at hand;"
9539,BOOK XII.,"So fierce the pressure of the Lycian chiefs,"
9540,BOOK XII.,"Undaunted now, as ever, in the fight."
9541,BOOK XII.,"But if they too are hardly press’d, at least"
9542,BOOK XII.,"Let Ajax, son of Telamon, be spar’d,"
9543,BOOK XII.,"And with him Teucer, skilled to draw the bow.”"
9544,BOOK XII.,"He said; the herald heard, and straight obey’d;"
9545,BOOK XII.,"Along the wall, where stood the brass-clad Greeks,"
9546,BOOK XII.,"He ran, and standing near th’ Ajaces, said:"
9547,BOOK XII.,
9548,BOOK XII.,"“Ajaces, leaders of the brass-clad Greeks,"
9549,BOOK XII.,The son of Heav’n-born Peteus craves your aid.
9550,BOOK XII.,To share awhile the labours of his guard;
9551,BOOK XII.,"Both, if it may be; so he best may hope"
9552,BOOK XII.,"To ’scape the death, which else is near at hand:"
9553,BOOK XII.,"So fierce the pressure of the Lycian chiefs,"
9554,BOOK XII.,"Undaunted now, as ever, in the fight."
9555,BOOK XII.,"But if ye too are hardly press’d, at least"
9556,BOOK XII.,"Let Ajax, son of Telamon, be spar’d,"
9557,BOOK XII.,"And with him Teucer, skill’d to draw the bow.”"
9558,BOOK XII.,
9559,BOOK XII.,He said: the mighty son of Telamon
9560,BOOK XII.,"Consenting, thus addresss’d Oileus’ son:"
9561,BOOK XII.,"“Ajax, do thou and valiant Lyeomede"
9562,BOOK XII.,Exhort the Greeks the struggle to maintain;
9563,BOOK XII.,"While I go yonder, to affront the war,"
9564,BOOK XII.,"To aid their need, and back return in haste.”"
9565,BOOK XII.,
9566,BOOK XII.,"Thus saying, Ajax Telamon set forth,"
9567,BOOK XII.,"And with him Teucer went, his father’s son,"
9568,BOOK XII.,While by Pandion Teucer’s bow was borne.
9569,BOOK XII.,"At brave Menestheus’ tow’r, within the wall,"
9570,BOOK XII.,"Arriv’d, sore press’d they found the garrison;"
9571,BOOK XII.,For like a whirlwind on the ramparts pour’d
9572,BOOK XII.,The Lycians’ valiant councillors and chiefs.
9573,BOOK XII.,"They quickly join’d the fray, and loud arose"
9574,BOOK XII.,The battle-cry; first Ajax Telamon
9575,BOOK XII.,"Sarpedon’s comrade, brave Epicles, slew,"
9576,BOOK XII.,"Struck by a rugged stone, within the wall"
9577,BOOK XII.,"Which lay, the topmost of the parapet,"
9578,BOOK XII.,Of size prodigious; which with both his hands
9579,BOOK XII.,"A man in youth’s full vigour scarce could raise,"
9580,BOOK XII.,"As men are now; he lifted it on high,"
9581,BOOK XII.,"And downward hurl’d; the four-peak’d helm it broke,"
9582,BOOK XII.,"Crushing the bone, and shatt’ring all the skull;"
9583,BOOK XII.,"He, like a diver, from the lofty tow’r"
9584,BOOK XII.,"Fell headlong down, and life forsook his bones,"
9585,BOOK XII.,"Teucer, meanwhile, from off the lofty wall"
9586,BOOK XII.,"The valiant Glaucus, pressing to the fight,"
9587,BOOK XII.,"Struck with an arrow, where he saw his arm"
9588,BOOK XII.,Unguarded; he no longer brook’d the fray;
9589,BOOK XII.,"Back from the wall he sprang, in hopes to hide"
9590,BOOK XII.,"From Grecian eyes his wound, that none might see,"
9591,BOOK XII.,And triumph o’er him with insulting words.
9592,BOOK XII.,"With grief Sarpedon saw his friend withdraw,"
9593,BOOK XII.,"Yet not relax’d his efforts; Thestor’s son,"
9594,BOOK XII.,"Alcmaon, with his spear he stabb’d, and back"
9595,BOOK XII.,"The weapon drew; he, following, prostrate fell,"
9596,BOOK XII.,And loudly rang his arms of polish’d brass.
9597,BOOK XII.,"Then at the parapet, with stalwart hand,"
9598,BOOK XII.,Sarpedon tugg’d; and yielding to his force
9599,BOOK XII.,"Down fell the block entire; the wall laid bare,"
9600,BOOK XII.,To many at once the breach gave open way.
9601,BOOK XII.,Ajax and Teucer him at once assail’d;
9602,BOOK XII.,This with an arrow struck the glitt’ring belt
9603,BOOK XII.,"Around his breast, whence hung his pond’rous shield;"
9604,BOOK XII.,"But Jove, who will’d not that his son should fall"
9605,BOOK XII.,"Before the ships, the weapon turn’d aside."
9606,BOOK XII.,"Then forward Ajax sprang, and with his spear"
9607,BOOK XII.,"Thrust at the shield; the weapon pass’d not through,"
9608,BOOK XII.,Yet check’d his bold advance; a little space
9609,BOOK XII.,"Back he recoil’d, but not the more withdrew,"
9610,BOOK XII.,"His soul on glory intent; and rallying quick,"
9611,BOOK XII.,Thus to the warlike Lycians shouted loud:
9612,BOOK XII.,
9613,BOOK XII.,"“Why, Lycians, thus your wonted might relax?"
9614,BOOK XII.,"’Tis hard for one alone, how brave soe’er,"
9615,BOOK XII.,"E’en though he break the rampart down, to force"
9616,BOOK XII.,A passage to the ships; but on with me!
9617,BOOK XII.,For work is here for many hands to do.”
9618,BOOK XII.,
9619,BOOK XII.,"He said; and by the King’s rebuke abash’d,"
9620,BOOK XII.,With fiercer zeal the Lycians press’d around
9621,BOOK XII.,Their King and councillor; on th’ other side
9622,BOOK XII.,Within the wall the Greeks their squadrons mass’d;
9623,BOOK XII.,Then were great deeds achiev’d; nor thro’ the breach
9624,BOOK XII.,Could the brave troops of Lycia to the ships
9625,BOOK XII.,Their passage force; nor could the warrior Greeks
9626,BOOK XII.,"Repel the Lycians from the ground, where they,"
9627,BOOK XII.,"Before the wall, had made their footing good."
9628,BOOK XII.,"As when two neighbours, in a common field,"
9629,BOOK XII.,"Each line in hand, within a narrow space,"
9630,BOOK XII.,About the limits of their land contend;
9631,BOOK XII.,Between them thus the rampart drew the line;
9632,BOOK XII.,"O’er which the full-orb’d shields of tough bull’s-hide,"
9633,BOOK XII.,And lighter bucklers on the warriors’ breasts
9634,BOOK XII.,On either side they clove; and many a wound
9635,BOOK XII.,"The pitiless weapons dealt, on some who, turn’d,"
9636,BOOK XII.,"Their neck and back laid bare; on many more,"
9637,BOOK XII.,"Who full in front, and through their shields were struck."
9638,BOOK XII.,On ev’ry side the parapet and tow’rs
9639,BOOK XII.,With Greek and Trojan blood were spatter’d o’er.
9640,BOOK XII.,"Nor yet, e’en so, the Greeks to flight were driv’n;"
9641,BOOK XII.,"But as a woman that for wages spins,"
9642,BOOK XII.,"Honest and true, with wool and weights in hand,"
9643,BOOK XII.,"In even balance holds the scales, to mete"
9644,BOOK XII.,"Her humble hire, her children’s maintenance;"
9645,BOOK XII.,"So even hung the balance of the war,"
9646,BOOK XII.,"Till Jove with highest honour Hector crown’d,"
9647,BOOK XII.,"The son of Priam; he, the foremost, scal’d"
9648,BOOK XII.,"The wall, and loudly on the Trojans call’d:"
9649,BOOK XII.,
9650,BOOK XII.,"“On, valiant Trojans, on! the Grecian wall"
9651,BOOK XII.,"Break down, and wrap their ships in blazing fires.”"
9652,BOOK XII.,
9653,BOOK XII.,"Thus he, exhorting, spoke; they heard him all,"
9654,BOOK XII.,"And to the wall rush’d numberless, and swarm’d"
9655,BOOK XII.,"Upon the ramparts, bristling thick with spears."
9656,BOOK XII.,"Then Hector, stooping, seiz’d a pond’rous stone"
9657,BOOK XII.,"That lay before the gates; ’twas broad below,"
9658,BOOK XII.,"But sharp above; and scarce two lab’ring men,"
9659,BOOK XII.,"The strongest, from the ground could raise it up,"
9660,BOOK XII.,And load upon a wain; as men are now;
9661,BOOK XII.,"But he unaided lifted it with ease,"
9662,BOOK XII.,"So light it seem’d, by grace of Saturn’s son."
9663,BOOK XII.,As in one hand a shepherd bears with ease
9664,BOOK XII.,"A full-siz’d fleece, and scarcely feels the weight;"
9665,BOOK XII.,"So Hector tow’rd the portals bore the stone,"
9666,BOOK XII.,"Which clos’d the lofty double-folding gates,"
9667,BOOK XII.,Within defended by two massive bars
9668,BOOK XII.,"Laid crosswise, and with one cross bolt secur’d."
9669,BOOK XII.,Close to the gate he stood; and planting firm
9670,BOOK XII.,"His foot, to give his arm its utmost pow’r,"
9671,BOOK XII.,Full on the middle dash’d the mighty mass.
9672,BOOK XII.,The hinges both gave way; the pond’rous stone
9673,BOOK XII.,Fell inwards; widely gap’d the op’ning gates;
9674,BOOK XII.,Nor might the bars within the blow sustain:
9675,BOOK XII.,This way and that the sever’d portals flew
9676,BOOK XII.,Before the crashing missile; dark as night
9677,BOOK XII.,"His low’ring brow, great Hector sprang within;"
9678,BOOK XII.,"Bright flash’d the brazen armour on his breast,"
9679,BOOK XII.,"As through the gates, two jav’lins in his hand,"
9680,BOOK XII.,"He sprang; the Gods except, no pow’r might meet"
9681,BOOK XII.,That onset; blaz’d his eyes with lurid fire.
9682,BOOK XII.,"Then to the Trojans, turning to the throng,"
9683,BOOK XII.,He call’d aloud to scale the lofty wall;
9684,BOOK XII.,"They heard, and straight obey’d; some scal’d the wall:"
9685,BOOK XII.,Some through the strong-built gates continuous pour’d;
9686,BOOK XII.,While in confusion irretrievable
9687,BOOK XII.,Fled to their ships the panic-stricken Greeks.

9704,ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.,"losing his spear in the encounter, repairs to seek another at the tent"
9705,ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.,"of Idomeneus; this occasions a conversation between these two warriors,"
9706,ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.,who return together to the battle. Idomeneus signalizes his courage
9707,ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.,"above the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and Alcathous; Deiphobus"
9708,ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.,"and Æneas march against him, and at length Idomeneus retires. Menelaus"
9709,ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.,wounds Helenus and kills Peisander. The Trojans are repulsed in the
9710,ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.,"left wing. Hector still keeps his ground against the Ajaces, till,"
9711,ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.,"being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas advises to"
9712,ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.,"call a council of war: Hector approves his advice, but goes first to"
9713,ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.,"rally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax again,"
9714,ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.,and renews the attack.
9715,ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.,
9716,ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.,The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the

9720,BOOK XIII.,
9721,BOOK XIII.,When Jove had Hector and the Trojans brought
9722,BOOK XIII.,"Close to the ships, he left them there to toil"
9723,BOOK XIII.,And strife continuous; turning his keen glance
9724,BOOK XIII.,"To view far off th’ equestrian tribes of Thrace,"
9725,BOOK XIII.,"The warlike Mysians, and the men who feed"
9726,BOOK XIII.,"On milk of mares, thence Hippemolgi term’d;"
9727,BOOK XIII.,"A peaceful race, the justest of mankind."
9728,BOOK XIII.,On Troy he turn’d not once his piercing glance;
9729,BOOK XIII.,Nor deem’d he any God would dare to give
9730,BOOK XIII.,To Trojans or to Greeks his active aid.
9731,BOOK XIII.,
9732,BOOK XIII.,No careless watch the monarch Neptune kept:
9733,BOOK XIII.,"Wond’ring, he view’d the battle, where he sat"
9734,BOOK XIII.,"Aloft on wooded Samos’ topmost peak,"
9735,BOOK XIII.,"Samos of Thrace; whence Ida’s heights he saw,"
9736,BOOK XIII.,"And Priam’s city, and the ships of Greece."
9737,BOOK XIII.,
9738,BOOK XIII.,"Thither ascended from the sea, he sat;"
9739,BOOK XIII.,"And thence the Greeks, by Trojans overborne,"
9740,BOOK XIII.,"Pitying he saw, and deeply wroth with Jove."
9741,BOOK XIII.,Then down the mountain’s craggy side he pass’d
9742,BOOK XIII.,"With rapid step; and as he mov’d along,"
9743,BOOK XIII.,Beneath th’ immortal feet of Ocean’s Lord
9744,BOOK XIII.,Quak’d the huge mountain and the shadowy wood.
9745,BOOK XIII.,"Three strides he took; the fourth, he reach’d his goal,"
9746,BOOK XIII.,Ægae; where on the margin of the bay
9747,BOOK XIII.,"His temple stood, all glitt’ring, all of gold,"
9748,BOOK XIII.,"Imperishable; there arriv’d, he yok’d"
9749,BOOK XIII.,"Beneath his car the brazen-footed steeds,"
9750,BOOK XIII.,"Of swiftest flight, with manes of flowing gold."
9751,BOOK XIII.,"All clad in gold, the golden lash he grasp’d"
9752,BOOK XIII.,"Of curious work, and mounting on his car,"
9753,BOOK XIII.,Skimm’d o’er the waves; from all the depths below
9754,BOOK XIII.,"Gamboll’d around the monsters of the deep,"
9755,BOOK XIII.,Acknowledging their King; the joyous sea
9756,BOOK XIII.,"Parted her waves; swift flew the bounding steeds,"
9757,BOOK XIII.,"Nor was the brazen axle wet with spray,"
9758,BOOK XIII.,When to the ships of Greece their Lord they bore.
9759,BOOK XIII.,
9760,BOOK XIII.,Down in the deep recesses of the sea
9761,BOOK XIII.,"A spacious cave there is, which lies midway"
9762,BOOK XIII.,’Twixt Tenedos and Imbros’ rocky isle:
9763,BOOK XIII.,"Th’ Earth-shaking Neptune there his coursers stay’d,"
9764,BOOK XIII.,"Loos’d from the chariot, and before them plac’d"
9765,BOOK XIII.,Ambrosial provender; and round their feet
9766,BOOK XIII.,"Shackles of gold, which none might break nor loose,"
9767,BOOK XIII.,That there they might await their Lord’s return;
9768,BOOK XIII.,Then to the Grecian army took his way.
9769,BOOK XIII.,
9770,BOOK XIII.,"Meantime, by Hector, son of Priam, led,"
9771,BOOK XIII.,"Like fire, or whirlwind, press’d the Trojans on,"
9772,BOOK XIII.,"With furious zeal, and shouts and clamour hoarse;"
9773,BOOK XIII.,"In hopes to take the ships, and all the chiefs"
9774,BOOK XIII.,To slay beside them; but from Ocean’s depths
9775,BOOK XIII.,"Uprose th’ Earth-shaker, Circler of the Earth,"
9776,BOOK XIII.,"To Calchas’ likeness and deep voice conform’d,"
9777,BOOK XIII.,"And rous’d the fainting Greeks; th’ Ajaces first,"
9778,BOOK XIII.,"Themselves with ardour fill’d, he thus address’d:"
9779,BOOK XIII.,"“’Tis yours, Ajaces, fill’d with courage high,"
9780,BOOK XIII.,"Discarding chilly fear, to save the Greeks:"
9781,BOOK XIII.,"Elsewhere I dread not much the Trojan force,"
9782,BOOK XIII.,Though they in crowds have scal’d the lofty wall;
9783,BOOK XIII.,The well-greav’d Greeks their onset may defy.
9784,BOOK XIII.,"Yet greatly fear I lest we suffer loss,"
9785,BOOK XIII.,"Where that fierce, fiery madman, Hector, leads."
9786,BOOK XIII.,Who boasts himself the son of Jove most high.
9787,BOOK XIII.,"But may some God your hearts inspire, yourselves"
9788,BOOK XIII.,"Firmly to stand, and cheer your comrades on;"
9789,BOOK XIII.,So from your swiftly-sailing ships ye yet
9790,BOOK XIII.,"May drive the foe, how bold soe’er he be,"
9791,BOOK XIII.,Though by Olympian Jove himself upheld.”
9792,BOOK XIII.,
9793,BOOK XIII.,"So spake th’ Earth-shaker, Circler of the Earth,"
9794,BOOK XIII.,"And with his sceptre touching both the chiefs,"
9795,BOOK XIII.,"Fill’d them with strength and courage, and their limbs,"
9796,BOOK XIII.,"Their feet and hands, with active vigour strung;"
9797,BOOK XIII.,"Then like a swift-wing’d falcon sprang to flight,"
9798,BOOK XIII.,Which down the sheer face of some lofty rock
9799,BOOK XIII.,Swoops on the plain to seize his feather’d prey:
9800,BOOK XIII.,So swiftly Neptune left the chiefs; him first
9801,BOOK XIII.,"Departing, knew Oileus’ active son,"
9802,BOOK XIII.,And thus the son of Telamon address’d:
9803,BOOK XIII.,"“Ajax, since some one of th’ Olympian Gods,"
9804,BOOK XIII.,"In likeness of a seer, hath hither come"
9805,BOOK XIII.,"To urge us to the war (no Calchas he,"
9806,BOOK XIII.,Our augur Heav’n-inspir’d; for well I mark’d
9807,BOOK XIII.,"His movements, as he went; and of a God"
9808,BOOK XIII.,"’Tis easy to discern the outward signs),"
9809,BOOK XIII.,"I feel fresh spirit kindled in my breast,"
9810,BOOK XIII.,And new-born vigour in my feet and hands.”
9811,BOOK XIII.,
9812,BOOK XIII.,Whom answer’d thus the son of Telamon:
9813,BOOK XIII.,"“My hands too grasp with firmer hold the spear,"
9814,BOOK XIII.,My spirit like thine is stirr’d; I feel my feet
9815,BOOK XIII.,Instinct with fiery life; nor should I fear
9816,BOOK XIII.,"With Hector, son of Priam, in his might"
9817,BOOK XIII.,"Alone to meet, and grapple to the death.”"
9818,BOOK XIII.,
9819,BOOK XIII.,"Such was their mutual converse, as they joy’d"
9820,BOOK XIII.,In the fierce transport by the God inspir’d.
9821,BOOK XIII.,"Neptune, meanwhile, the other Greeks arous’d,"
9822,BOOK XIII.,"Who, to the ships withdrawn, their wasted strength"
9823,BOOK XIII.,"Recruited; for their limbs were faint with toil,"
9824,BOOK XIII.,"And grief was in their hearts, as they beheld"
9825,BOOK XIII.,The Trojan hosts that scal’d the lofty wall;
9826,BOOK XIII.,"They saw, and from their eyes the teardrops fell,"
9827,BOOK XIII.,Of safety desp’rate; but th’ Earth-shaking God
9828,BOOK XIII.,"Amid their ranks appearing, soon restor’d"
9829,BOOK XIII.,"Their firm array; to Teucer first he came,"
9830,BOOK XIII.,"To Leitus, and valiant Peneleus,"
9831,BOOK XIII.,"Thoas, Deipyrus, Meriones,"
9832,BOOK XIII.,"And young Antilochus, brave warriors all,"
9833,BOOK XIII.,And to the chiefs his winged words address’d:
9834,BOOK XIII.,
9835,BOOK XIII.,"“Shame on ye, Grecian youths! to you I look’d"
9836,BOOK XIII.,As to our ships’ defenders; but if ye
9837,BOOK XIII.,"Shrink from the perilous battle, then indeed"
9838,BOOK XIII.,"Our day is come, to be by Troy subdu’d."
9839,BOOK XIII.,"O Heav’n! a sad and wondrous sight is this,"
9840,BOOK XIII.,"A sight I never deem’d my eyes should see,"
9841,BOOK XIII.,Our ships assail’d by Trojan troops; by those
9842,BOOK XIII.,Who heretofore have been as tim’rous hinds
9843,BOOK XIII.,"Amid the forest depths, the helpless prey"
9844,BOOK XIII.,"Of jackals, pards, and wolves; they here and there,"
9845,BOOK XIII.,"Uncertain, heartless, unresisting, fly:"
9846,BOOK XIII.,"Such were the Trojans once; nor dar’d abide,"
9847,BOOK XIII.,"No, not an hour, the strength and arms of Greece;"
9848,BOOK XIII.,"And these are they, who now beside our ships,"
9849,BOOK XIII.,"Far from their city walls, maintain the fight,"
9850,BOOK XIII.,"Embolden’d by our great commander’s fault,"
9851,BOOK XIII.,"And slackness of the people, who, with him"
9852,BOOK XIII.,"Offended, scarce are brought to guard our ships."
9853,BOOK XIII.,"And, feebly fighting, are beside them slain."
9854,BOOK XIII.,"E’en though the mighty monarch, Atreus’ son,"
9855,BOOK XIII.,"Wide-ruling Agamemnon, be in truth"
9856,BOOK XIII.,"Wholly to blame in this, that he hath wrong’d"
9857,BOOK XIII.,"The son of Peleus, yet ’tis not for us"
9858,BOOK XIII.,Our courage to relax. Arouse ye then!
9859,BOOK XIII.,A brave man’s spirit its vigour soon regains.
9860,BOOK XIII.,"That ye, the best and bravest of the host,"
9861,BOOK XIII.,"Should stand aloof thus idly, ’tis not well;"
9862,BOOK XIII.,"If meaner men should from the battle shrink,"
9863,BOOK XIII.,I might not blame them; but that such as ye
9864,BOOK XIII.,"Should falter, indignation fills my soul."
9865,BOOK XIII.,"Dear friends, from this remissness must accrue"
9866,BOOK XIII.,Yet greater evils; but with gen’rous shame
9867,BOOK XIII.,And keen remorse let each man’s breast be fill’d;
9868,BOOK XIII.,Fierce is the struggle; in his pride of strength
9869,BOOK XIII.,"Hector has forc’d the gates and massive bars,"
9870,BOOK XIII.,"And raging, ’mid the ships maintains the war.”"
9871,BOOK XIII.,
9872,BOOK XIII.,"Thus Neptune on the Greeks, reproving, call’d:"
9873,BOOK XIII.,Then round th’ Ajaces twain were cluster’d thick
9874,BOOK XIII.,"The serried files, whose firm array nor Mars,"
9875,BOOK XIII.,Nor spirit-stirring Pallas might reprove:
9876,BOOK XIII.,"For there, the bravest all, in order due,"
9877,BOOK XIII.,Waited the Trojan charge by Hector led:
9878,BOOK XIII.,"Spear close by spear, and shield by shield o’erlaid,"
9879,BOOK XIII.,"Buckler to buckler press’d, and helm to helm,"
9880,BOOK XIII.,"And man to man; the horsehair plumes above,"
9881,BOOK XIII.,"That nodded on the warriors’ glitt’ring crests,"
9882,BOOK XIII.,Each other touch’d; so closely massed they stood.
9883,BOOK XIII.,"Backward, by many a stalwart hand, were drawn"
9884,BOOK XIII.,"The spears, in act to hurl; their eyes and minds"
9885,BOOK XIII.,"Turn’d to the front, and eager for the fray."
9886,BOOK XIII.,On pour’d the Trojan masses; in the van
9887,BOOK XIII.,Hector straight forward urg’d his furious course.
9888,BOOK XIII.,"As some huge boulder, from its rocky bed"
9889,BOOK XIII.,"Detach’d, and by the wintry torrent’s force"
9890,BOOK XIII.,"Hurl’d down the cliff’s steep face, when constant rains"
9891,BOOK XIII.,The massive rock’s firm hold have undermin’d;
9892,BOOK XIII.,With giant bounds it flies; the crashing wood
9893,BOOK XIII.,"Resounds beneath it; still it hurries on,"
9894,BOOK XIII.,"Until, arriving at the level plain,"
9895,BOOK XIII.,"Its headlong impulse check’d, it rolls no more;"
9896,BOOK XIII.,"So Hector, threat’ning now through ships and tents,"
9897,BOOK XIII.,"E’en to the sea, to force his murd’rous way,"
9898,BOOK XIII.,"Anon, confronted by that phalanx firm,"
9899,BOOK XIII.,"Halts close before it; while the sons of Greece,"
9900,BOOK XIII.,"With thrust of sword and double-pointed spears,"
9901,BOOK XIII.,Stave off his onset; he a little space
9902,BOOK XIII.,"Withdrew, and loudly on the Trojans call’d:"
9903,BOOK XIII.,
9904,BOOK XIII.,"“Trojans, and Lycians, and ye Dardans fam’d"
9905,BOOK XIII.,"In close encounter, stand ye firm! not long"
9906,BOOK XIII.,"The Greeks, though densely mass’d, shall bar my way,"
9907,BOOK XIII.,"But soon, methinks, before my spear shall quail,"
9908,BOOK XIII.,"If from the chief of Gods my mission be,"
9909,BOOK XIII.,"From Jove the Thund’rer, royal Juno’s Lord.”"
9910,BOOK XIII.,
9911,BOOK XIII.,His words fresh courage rais’d in ev’ry breast;
9912,BOOK XIII.,"On loftiest deeds intent, Deiphobus,"
9913,BOOK XIII.,"The son of Priam, from the foremost ranks,"
9914,BOOK XIII.,"His shield’s broad orb before him borne, advanc’d"
9915,BOOK XIII.,"With airy step, protected by the shield:"
9916,BOOK XIII.,At him Meriones with glitt’ring spear
9917,BOOK XIII.,"Took aim, nor miss’d his mark; the shield’s broad orb"
9918,BOOK XIII.,"Of tough bull’s-hide it struck; but pass’d not through,"
9919,BOOK XIII.,For near the head the sturdy shaft was snapp’d.
9920,BOOK XIII.,Yet from before his breast Deiphobus
9921,BOOK XIII.,Held at arm’s length his shield; for much he fear’d
9922,BOOK XIII.,The weapon of Meriones; but he
9923,BOOK XIII.,"Back to his comrades’ shelt’ring ranks withdrew,"
9924,BOOK XIII.,Griev’d at his baffled hopes and broken spear.
9925,BOOK XIII.,"Then tow’rd the ships he bent his steps, to seek"
9926,BOOK XIII.,"Another spear, which in his tent remain’d."
9927,BOOK XIII.,"The rest, ’mid wild uproar, maintain’d the fight."
9928,BOOK XIII.,
9929,BOOK XIII.,"There Teucer first, the son of Telamon,"
9930,BOOK XIII.,"A warrior slew, the son of Mentor, Lord"
9931,BOOK XIII.,"Of num’rous horses, Imbrius, spearman skill’d."
9932,BOOK XIII.,"In former days, ere came the sons of Greece,"
9933,BOOK XIII.,"He in Pedaeus dwelt, and had to wife"
9934,BOOK XIII.,"Medesicaste, Priam’s bastard child;"
9935,BOOK XIII.,"But when the well-trimm’d ships of Greece appear’d,"
9936,BOOK XIII.,"Return’d to Troy; and there, rever’d by all,"
9937,BOOK XIII.,"With Priam dwelt, who lov’d him as a son."
9938,BOOK XIII.,Him Teucer with his lance below the ear
9939,BOOK XIII.,"Stabb’d, and drew back the weapon; down he fell,"
9940,BOOK XIII.,"As by the woodman’s axe, on some high peak,"
9941,BOOK XIII.,"Falls a proud ash, conspicuous from afar,"
9942,BOOK XIII.,Scatt’ring its tender foliage on the ground;
9943,BOOK XIII.,He fell; and loud his burnish’d armour rang.
9944,BOOK XIII.,"Forth Teucer sprang to seize the spoil; at whom,"
9945,BOOK XIII.,"Advancing, Hector aim’d his glitt’ring spear;"
9946,BOOK XIII.,"He saw, and, stooping, shunn’d the brazen death"
9947,BOOK XIII.,A little space; but through the breast it struck
9948,BOOK XIII.,"Amphimachus, the son of Cteatus,"
9949,BOOK XIII.,"The son of Actor, hastening to the fight:"
9950,BOOK XIII.,"Thund’ring he fell, and loud his armour rang."
9951,BOOK XIII.,"Then forward Hector sprang, in hopes to seize"
9952,BOOK XIII.,"The brazen helm, that fitted well the brow"
9953,BOOK XIII.,Of brave Amphimachus; but Ajax met
9954,BOOK XIII.,Th’ advance of Hector with his glitt’ring spear;
9955,BOOK XIII.,"Himself he reach’d not, all in dazzling brass"
9956,BOOK XIII.,Encas’d; but pressing on his bossy shield
9957,BOOK XIII.,Drove by main force beyond where lay the dead:
9958,BOOK XIII.,Them both the Greeks withdrew; th’ Athenian chiefs
9959,BOOK XIII.,"Stychius and brave Menestheus, bore away"
9960,BOOK XIII.,Amid the ranks of Greece Amphimachus;
9961,BOOK XIII.,"While, as two lions high above the ground"
9962,BOOK XIII.,"Bear through the brushwood in their jaws a goat,"
9963,BOOK XIII.,Snatch’d from the sharp-fang’d dogs’ protecting care:
9964,BOOK XIII.,"So, fill’d with warlike rage, th’ Ajaces twain"
9965,BOOK XIII.,"Lifted on high, and of its armour stripp’d"
9966,BOOK XIII.,"The corpse of Imbrius; and Oileus’ son,"
9967,BOOK XIII.,"Griev’d at Amphimachus, his comrade’s death,"
9968,BOOK XIII.,"Cut from the tender neck, and like a ball"
9969,BOOK XIII.,Sent whirling through the crowd the sever’d head;
9970,BOOK XIII.,And in the dust at Hector’s feet it fell.
9971,BOOK XIII.,"Then, for his grandson slain, fierce anger fill’d"
9972,BOOK XIII.,The breast of Neptune; through the tents of Greece
9973,BOOK XIII.,"And ships he pass’d, the Greeks encouraging,"
9974,BOOK XIII.,And ills preparing for the sons of Troy.
9975,BOOK XIII.,"Him met Idomeneus, the warrior King,"
9976,BOOK XIII.,"Leaving a comrade, from the battle field,"
9977,BOOK XIII.,"Wounded behind the knee, but newly brought;"
9978,BOOK XIII.,"Borne by his comrades, to the leech’s care"
9979,BOOK XIII.,"He left him, eager to rejoin the fray;"
9980,BOOK XIII.,"Whom by his tent th’ Earth-shaking God address’d,"
9981,BOOK XIII.,"The voice assuming of Andraemon’s son,"
9982,BOOK XIII.,"Who o’er th’ Ætolians, as a God rever’d,"
9983,BOOK XIII.,"In Pleuron reign’d, and lofty Calydon:"
9984,BOOK XIII.,
9985,BOOK XIII.,"“Where now, Idomeneus, sage Cretan chief,"
9986,BOOK XIII.,"Are all the vaunting threats, so freely pour’d"
9987,BOOK XIII.,Against the Trojans by the sons of Greece?”
9988,BOOK XIII.,
9989,BOOK XIII.,"To whom the Cretan King, Idomeneus:"
9990,BOOK XIII.,"“Thoas, on none, so far as I may judge,"
9991,BOOK XIII.,May blame be cast; we all our duties know;
9992,BOOK XIII.,"Nor see I one by heartless fear restrain’d,"
9993,BOOK XIII.,"Nor hanging back, and flinching from the war:"
9994,BOOK XIII.,Yet by th’ o’erruling will of Saturn’s son
9995,BOOK XIII.,"It seems decreed that here the Greeks should fall,"
9996,BOOK XIII.,And far from Argos lie in nameless graves.
9997,BOOK XIII.,"But, Thoas, as thyself art ever staunch,"
9998,BOOK XIII.,"Nor slow the laggards to reprove, thy work"
9999,BOOK XIII.,Remit not now; but rouse each sev’ral man.”
10000,BOOK XIII.,
10001,BOOK XIII.,To whom Earth-shaking Neptune thus replied:
10002,BOOK XIII.,"“Idomeneus, may he from Troy return"
10003,BOOK XIII.,"No more, but here remain to glut the dogs,"
10004,BOOK XIII.,"If such there be, from this day’s fight who shrinks."
10005,BOOK XIII.,"But haste thee, don thine arms; great need is now"
10006,BOOK XIII.,"To hasten, if in aught we two may serve:"
10007,BOOK XIII.,"E’en meaner men, united, courage gain;"
10008,BOOK XIII.,But we the bravest need not fear to meet.”
10009,BOOK XIII.,
10010,BOOK XIII.,"He said, and to the strife of men return’d."
10011,BOOK XIII.,"Within his well-constructed tent arriv’d,"
10012,BOOK XIII.,Straight donn’d Idomeneus his armour bright:
10013,BOOK XIII.,"Two spears he took; and, like the lightning’s flash,"
10014,BOOK XIII.,"Which, as a sign to men, the hand of Jove"
10015,BOOK XIII.,Hurls downwards from Olympus’ glitt’ring heights;
10016,BOOK XIII.,Whose dazzling radiance far around is thrown;
10017,BOOK XIII.,"Flash’d, as the warrior ran, his armour bright."
10018,BOOK XIII.,"Him met Meriones, his follower brave,"
10019,BOOK XIII.,Close to the tent; to seek a spear he came;
10020,BOOK XIII.,"To whom Idomeneus: “Meriones,"
10021,BOOK XIII.,"Swift-footed son of Molus, comrade dear,"
10022,BOOK XIII.,"Why com’st thou here, and leav’st the battle field?"
10023,BOOK XIII.,"Hast thou some wound receiv’d, whereof the pain"
10024,BOOK XIII.,"Subdues thy spirit? or com’st thou, to the field"
10025,BOOK XIII.,"To summon me? unsummon’d, well thou know’st"
10026,BOOK XIII.,I better love the battle than the tent.”
10027,BOOK XIII.,
10028,BOOK XIII.,Whom answer’d thus the sage Meriones:
10029,BOOK XIII.,"“Idomeneus, the brass-clad Cretans’ King,"
10030,BOOK XIII.,"I come to seek a spear, if haply such"
10031,BOOK XIII.,"Within thy tent be found; for, in the fight,"
10032,BOOK XIII.,"That which I lately bore, e’en now I broke"
10033,BOOK XIII.,Against the shield of brave Deiphobus.”
10034,BOOK XIII.,
10035,BOOK XIII.,"To whom Idomeneus, the Cretan King:"
10036,BOOK XIII.,"“Of spears, or one, or twenty, if thou list,"
10037,BOOK XIII.,Thou there mayst find against the polish’d wall.
10038,BOOK XIII.,The spoil of Trojans slain; for with my foes
10039,BOOK XIII.,’Tis not my wont to wage a distant war.
10040,BOOK XIII.,"Thence have I store of spears, and bossy shields,"
10041,BOOK XIII.,"And crested helms, and breastplates polish’d bright.”"
10042,BOOK XIII.,
10043,BOOK XIII.,Whom answer’d thus the sage Meriones:
10044,BOOK XIII.,“Nor are my tent and dark-ribb’d ship devoid
10045,BOOK XIII.,Of Trojan spoils; but they are far to seek;
10046,BOOK XIII.,Nor deem I that my hand is slack in fight;
10047,BOOK XIII.,For ’mid the foremost in the glorious strife
10048,BOOK XIII.,"I stand, whene’er is heard the battle cry."
10049,BOOK XIII.,My deeds by others of the brass-clad Greeks
10050,BOOK XIII.,May not be noted; but thou know’st them well.”
10051,BOOK XIII.,
10052,BOOK XIII.,"To whom Idomeneus, the Cretan King:"
10053,BOOK XIII.,“What need of this? thy prowess well I know;
10054,BOOK XIII.,For should we choose our bravest through the fleet
10055,BOOK XIII.,"To man the secret ambush, surest test"
10056,BOOK XIII.,"Of warriors’ courage, where is manifest"
10057,BOOK XIII.,The diff’rence ’twixt the coward and the brave;
10058,BOOK XIII.,"(The coward’s colour changes, nor his soul"
10059,BOOK XIII.,"Within his breast its even balance keeps,"
10060,BOOK XIII.,"But changing still, from foot to foot he shifts,"
10061,BOOK XIII.,"And in his bosom loudly beats his heart,"
10062,BOOK XIII.,Expecting death; and chatter all his teeth:
10063,BOOK XIII.,The brave man’s colour changes not; no fear
10064,BOOK XIII.,"He knows, the ambush ent’ring; all his pray’r"
10065,BOOK XIII.,Is that the hour of battle soon may come)
10066,BOOK XIII.,"E’en there, thy courage none might call in doubt."
10067,BOOK XIII.,"Shouldst thou from spear or sword receive a wound,"
10068,BOOK XIII.,"Not on thy neck behind, nor on thy back"
10069,BOOK XIII.,"Would fall the blow, but on thy breast, in front,"
10070,BOOK XIII.,Still pressing onward ’mid the foremost ranks.
10071,BOOK XIII.,"But come, prolong we not this idle talk,"
10072,BOOK XIII.,"Like babblers vain, who scorn might justly move:"
10073,BOOK XIII.,"Haste to my tent, and there select thy spear.”"
10074,BOOK XIII.,
10075,BOOK XIII.,"He said: and from the tent Meriones,"
10076,BOOK XIII.,"Valiant as Mars, his spear selected straight,"
10077,BOOK XIII.,"And, eager for the fray, rejoin’d his chief."
10078,BOOK XIII.,"As Mars, the bane of men, goes forth to war,"
10079,BOOK XIII.,"Attended by his strong, unfearing son,"
10080,BOOK XIII.,"Terror, who shakes the bravest warrior’s soul;"
10081,BOOK XIII.,"They two, from Thrace, against the Ephyri,"
10082,BOOK XIII.,Or haughty Phlegyans arm; nor hear alike
10083,BOOK XIII.,"The pray’rs of both the combatants, one side"
10084,BOOK XIII.,With vict’ry crowning; so to battle went
10085,BOOK XIII.,"Those leaders twain, in dazzling arms array’d:"
10086,BOOK XIII.,Then thus Meriones his chief address’d:
10087,BOOK XIII.,
10088,BOOK XIII.,"“Son of Deucalion, say if on the right,"
10089,BOOK XIII.,"Or on the centre of the gen’ral host,"
10090,BOOK XIII.,"Our onset should be made, or on the left;"
10091,BOOK XIII.,"For there, methinks, most succour need the Greeks.”"
10092,BOOK XIII.,
10093,BOOK XIII.,"To whom Idomeneus, the Cretan chief:"
10094,BOOK XIII.,"“Others there are the centre to defend,"
10095,BOOK XIII.,"Th’ Ajaces both, and Teucer, of the Greeks"
10096,BOOK XIII.,"Best archer, good too in the standing fight;"
10097,BOOK XIII.,"These may for Hector full employment find,"
10098,BOOK XIII.,"Brave as he is, and eager for the fray;"
10099,BOOK XIII.,"E’en for his courage ’twere a task too hard,"
10100,BOOK XIII.,"Their might to conquer, and resistless hands,"
10101,BOOK XIII.,"And burn the ships, if Saturn’s son himself"
10102,BOOK XIII.,"Fire not, and ’mid the shipping throw the torch."
10103,BOOK XIII.,"Great Ajax Telamon to none would yield,"
10104,BOOK XIII.,"Of mortal birth, by earthly food sustain’d,"
10105,BOOK XIII.,By spear or pond’rous stone assailable;
10106,BOOK XIII.,"In hand to hand encounter, scarce surpass’d"
10107,BOOK XIII.,By Peleus’ son Achilles; though with him
10108,BOOK XIII.,In speed of foot he might not hope to vie.
10109,BOOK XIII.,Then on the left let us our onset make;
10110,BOOK XIII.,And quickly learn if we on others’ heads
10111,BOOK XIII.,"Are doom’d to win renown, or they on ours.”"
10112,BOOK XIII.,
10113,BOOK XIII.,"He said: and, brave as Mars, Meriones,"
10114,BOOK XIII.,"Thither where he directed, led the way."
10115,BOOK XIII.,"Now when, attended thus, Idomeneus,"
10116,BOOK XIII.,"Like blazing fire, in dazzling arms appear’d,"
10117,BOOK XIII.,"Around him throng’d, with rallying cries, the Greeks,"
10118,BOOK XIII.,And rag’d beside the ships the balanc’d fight.
10119,BOOK XIII.,"As, when the dust lies deepest on the roads,"
10120,BOOK XIII.,"Before the boist’rous winds the storm drives fast,"
10121,BOOK XIII.,And high at once the whirling clouds are toss’d;
10122,BOOK XIII.,So was the fight confus’d; and in the throng
10123,BOOK XIII.,Each man with keen desire of slaughter burn’d.
10124,BOOK XIII.,"Bristled the deadly strife with pond’rous spears,"
10125,BOOK XIII.,Wielded with dire intent; the brazen gleam
10126,BOOK XIII.,"Dazzled the sight, by flashing helmets cast,"
10127,BOOK XIII.,"And breastplates polish’d bright, and glitt’ring shields"
10128,BOOK XIII.,"Commingling; stern of heart indeed were he,"
10129,BOOK XIII.,"Who on that sight with joy, not pain, could gaze."
10130,BOOK XIII.,
10131,BOOK XIII.,Dire evil then on mortal warriors brought
10132,BOOK XIII.,The diverse minds of Saturn’s mighty sons:
10133,BOOK XIII.,"To Hector and the Trojans Jove design’d,"
10134,BOOK XIII.,"In honour of Achilles, swift of foot,"
10135,BOOK XIII.,To give the vict’ry; yet not utterly
10136,BOOK XIII.,He will’d to slay before the walls of Troy
10137,BOOK XIII.,The Grecian host; but glory to confer
10138,BOOK XIII.,On Thetis and her noble-minded son.
10139,BOOK XIII.,"Neptune, on th’ other side, the Greeks inspir’d,"
10140,BOOK XIII.,Clandestine rising from the hoary sea;
10141,BOOK XIII.,For them before the Trojan host o’erborne
10142,BOOK XIII.,"He saw with grief, and deeply wroth with Jove."
10143,BOOK XIII.,"Equal the rank of both, their birth the same,"
10144,BOOK XIII.,"But Jove in wisdom, as in years, the first."
10145,BOOK XIII.,Nor ventur’d Neptune openly to aid
10146,BOOK XIII.,"The cause of Greece; but cloth’d in mortal form,"
10147,BOOK XIII.,In secret still the army’s courage rous’d.
10148,BOOK XIII.,This way and that they tugg’d of furious war
10149,BOOK XIII.,"And balanc’d strife, where many a warrior fell,"
10150,BOOK XIII.,"The straining rope, which none might break or loose."
10151,BOOK XIII.,"Then, though his hair was grizzl’d o’er with age,"
10152,BOOK XIII.,"Calling the Greeks to aid, Idomeneus,"
10153,BOOK XIII.,"Inspiring terror, on the Trojans sprang,"
10154,BOOK XIII.,"And slew Othryoneus, who but of late"
10155,BOOK XIII.,Came from Cabesus on the alarm of war;
10156,BOOK XIII.,"And, welcomed as a guest in Priam’s house,"
10157,BOOK XIII.,"The fairest of his daughters sought to wed,"
10158,BOOK XIII.,"No portion asked, Cassandra; mighty deeds"
10159,BOOK XIII.,"He promis’d, from before the walls of Troy"
10160,BOOK XIII.,In their despite to drive the sons of Greece.
10161,BOOK XIII.,The aged Priam listen’d to his snit;
10162,BOOK XIII.,"And he, his promise trusting, fought for Troy."
10163,BOOK XIII.,"Him, marching with proud step, Idomeneus"
10164,BOOK XIII.,"Struck with his glitt’ring spear, nor aught avail’d"
10165,BOOK XIII.,"His brazen breastplate; through the middle thrust,"
10166,BOOK XIII.,Thund’ring he fell: the victor vaunting cried:
10167,BOOK XIII.,
10168,BOOK XIII.,"“Othryoneus, above all mortal men"
10169,BOOK XIII.,"I hold thee in respect, if thou indeed"
10170,BOOK XIII.,"Wilt make thy words to aged Priam good,"
10171,BOOK XIII.,Who promis’d thee his daughter in return:
10172,BOOK XIII.,We too would offer thee a like reward;
10173,BOOK XIII.,"And give thee here to wed, from Argos brought,"
10174,BOOK XIII.,"Atrides’ fairest daughter, if with us"
10175,BOOK XIII.,Thou wilt o’erthrow the well-built walls of Troy.
10176,BOOK XIII.,"Come then, on board our ocean-going ships"
10177,BOOK XIII.,Discuss the marriage contract; nor shall we
10178,BOOK XIII.,Be found illib’ral of our bridal gifts.”
10179,BOOK XIII.,
10180,BOOK XIII.,"He said, and seizing by the foot the slain,"
10181,BOOK XIII.,Dragg’d from the press; but to the rescue came
10182,BOOK XIII.,"Asius, himself on foot before his car:"
10183,BOOK XIII.,"So close his charioteer the horses held,"
10184,BOOK XIII.,They breath’d upon his shoulders; eagerly
10185,BOOK XIII.,"He sought to reach Idomeneus; but he,"
10186,BOOK XIII.,"Preventing, through his gullet drove the spear,"
10187,BOOK XIII.,Beneath his chin; right through the weapon pass’d;
10188,BOOK XIII.,"He fell; as falls an oak, or poplar tall,"
10189,BOOK XIII.,"Or lofty pine, which on the mountain top,"
10190,BOOK XIII.,"For some proud ship, the woodman’s axe hath hewn:"
10191,BOOK XIII.,"So he, before the car and horses stretch’d,"
10192,BOOK XIII.,"His death-cry utt’ring, clutch’d the blood-stain’d soil;"
10193,BOOK XIII.,"Bewilder’d, helpless, stood his charioteer;"
10194,BOOK XIII.,"Nor dar’d, escaping from the foemen’s hands,"
10195,BOOK XIII.,"To turn his horses: him, Antilochus"
10196,BOOK XIII.,Beneath the waistband struck; nor aught avail’d
10197,BOOK XIII.,"His brazen breastplate; through the middle thrust,"
10198,BOOK XIII.,"He, from the well-wrought chariot, gasping, fell."
10199,BOOK XIII.,"Antilochus, the noble Nestor’s son,"
10200,BOOK XIII.,"The horses seiz’d, and from the Trojan ranks"
10201,BOOK XIII.,Drove to the Grecian camp. For Asius’ death
10202,BOOK XIII.,"Deep griev’d, Deiphobus, approaching, hurl’d"
10203,BOOK XIII.,Against Idomeneus his glitt’ring spear:
10204,BOOK XIII.,"The coming weapon he beheld, and shunn’d:"
10205,BOOK XIII.,"Beneath the ample circle of his shield,"
10206,BOOK XIII.,"With hides and brazen plates encircled round,"
10207,BOOK XIII.,"And by two rods sustain’d, conceal’d he stood:"
10208,BOOK XIII.,"Beneath he crouch’d, and o’er him flew the spear:"
10209,BOOK XIII.,"Yet harsh it grated, glancing from the shield;"
10210,BOOK XIII.,"Nor bootless from that stalwart hand it flew,"
10211,BOOK XIII.,"But through the midriff, close below the heart,"
10212,BOOK XIII.,"Hypsenor, son of Hippasus, it struck,"
10213,BOOK XIII.,"And straight relax’d his limbs; then shouting loud,"
10214,BOOK XIII.,"In boastful tone, Deiphobus exclaim’d:"
10215,BOOK XIII.,
10216,BOOK XIII.,"“Not unaveng’d lies Asius; he, methinks,"
10217,BOOK XIII.,"As I have found him fellowship, with joy"
10218,BOOK XIII.,Thro’ Hades’ strongly-guarded gates may pass.”
10219,BOOK XIII.,"He said; the Greeks, indignant, heard his boast;"
10220,BOOK XIII.,"Chief, of Antilochus the manly soul"
10221,BOOK XIII.,Was stirr’d within him; yet amid his grief
10222,BOOK XIII.,"His comrade not forgetting, up he ran,"
10223,BOOK XIII.,And o’er him spread the cover of his shield.
10224,BOOK XIII.,"Meanwhile, two trusty friends, Mecistheus, son"
10225,BOOK XIII.,"Of Echius, and Alastor, rais’d the slain,"
10226,BOOK XIII.,And deeply groaning bore him to the ships.
10227,BOOK XIII.,Nor did Idomeneus his noble rage
10228,BOOK XIII.,Abate; still burning o’er some Trojan soul
10229,BOOK XIII.,To draw the gloomy veil of night and death;
10230,BOOK XIII.,"Or, having sav’d the Greeks, himself to fall."
10231,BOOK XIII.,"Then high-born Æsuetes’ son he slew,"
10232,BOOK XIII.,"Alcathous; he, Anchises’ son-in-law,"
10233,BOOK XIII.,"The eldest of his daughters had to wife,"
10234,BOOK XIII.,"Hippodamia; by her parents both,"
10235,BOOK XIII.,"O’er all, belov’d; in beauty, skill, and mind,"
10236,BOOK XIII.,"All her compeers surpassing; wife of one,"
10237,BOOK XIII.,The noblest man through all the breadth of Troy.
10238,BOOK XIII.,Him Neptune by Idomeneus subdued;
10239,BOOK XIII.,"Seal’d his quick eyes, his active limbs restrain’d,"
10240,BOOK XIII.,"Without the pow’r to fly, or shun the spear;"
10241,BOOK XIII.,"Fix’d as a pillar, or a lofty tree,"
10242,BOOK XIII.,"He stood, while through his breast Idomeneus"
10243,BOOK XIII.,"His weapon drove; the brazen mail it broke,"
10244,BOOK XIII.,Which oft had turn’d aside the stroke of death;
10245,BOOK XIII.,"Harshly it grated, sever’d by the spear:"
10246,BOOK XIII.,"He fell; the spear-point quiv’ring in his heart,"
10247,BOOK XIII.,Which with convulsive throbbings shook the shaft.
10248,BOOK XIII.,There Mars its course arrested. Then with shouts
10249,BOOK XIII.,"Of triumph, vaunting, thus Idomeneus:"
10250,BOOK XIII.,
10251,BOOK XIII.,"“How now, Deiphobus? are three for one"
10252,BOOK XIII.,An equal balance? where are now thy boasts?
10253,BOOK XIII.,"Come forth, my friend, thyself to me oppos’d;"
10254,BOOK XIII.,"And learn, if here, unworthy my descent"
10255,BOOK XIII.,"From Jove, my great progenitor, I stand."
10256,BOOK XIII.,"He Minos, guardian chief of Crete, begot;"
10257,BOOK XIII.,"Noble Deucalion was to Minos born,"
10258,BOOK XIII.,I to Deucalion; far extends my rule
10259,BOOK XIII.,"In wide-spread Crete; whom now our ships have brought,"
10260,BOOK XIII.,"A bane to thee, thy sire, and Trojans all.”"
10261,BOOK XIII.,
10262,BOOK XIII.,"He said; and doubtful stood Deiphobus,"
10263,BOOK XIII.,"Or to retreat, and summon to his aid"
10264,BOOK XIII.,"The Trojans, or alone the venture try."
10265,BOOK XIII.,"Thus as he mus’d, the wiser course appear’d"
10266,BOOK XIII.,"To seek Æneas; him he found apart,"
10267,BOOK XIII.,Behind the crowd; for he was still at feud
10268,BOOK XIII.,"With godlike Priam, who, he thought, withheld"
10269,BOOK XIII.,The public honour to his valour due.
10270,BOOK XIII.,"To whom Deiphobus, approaching, thus:"
10271,BOOK XIII.,
10272,BOOK XIII.,"“Æneas, sagest councillor of Troy,"
10273,BOOK XIII.,"Behoves thee now, if rev’rence for the dead"
10274,BOOK XIII.,"Can move thy soul, thy sister’s husband aid:"
10275,BOOK XIII.,"Haste we to save Alcathous; who of old,"
10276,BOOK XIII.,"When thou wast little, in thy father’s house,"
10277,BOOK XIII.,"Nurs’d thee with tender care; for him, but now,"
10278,BOOK XIII.,The spear-renown’d Idomeneus hath slain.”
10279,BOOK XIII.,
10280,BOOK XIII.,"He said; Æneas’ spirit was rous’d, and fill’d"
10281,BOOK XIII.,With martial rage he sought Idomeneus.
10282,BOOK XIII.,"Nor, cowardlike, did he th’ encounter shun;"
10283,BOOK XIII.,"But firmly stood, as stands a mountain-boar"
10284,BOOK XIII.,"Self-confident, that in some lonely spot"
10285,BOOK XIII.,Awaits the clam’rous chase; bristles his back;
10286,BOOK XIII.,His eyes with fire are flashing; and his tusks
10287,BOOK XIII.,"He whets, on men and dogs prepar’d to rush:"
10288,BOOK XIII.,"So stood the spear-renown’d Idomeneus,"
10289,BOOK XIII.,"The onset of Æneas, swift in fight,"
10290,BOOK XIII.,Awaiting; and the friends he saw around
10291,BOOK XIII.,"He summon’d to his aid; Ascalaphus,"
10292,BOOK XIII.,"Deipyrus, and brave Meriones,"
10293,BOOK XIII.,"Antilochus and Aphareus; to these,"
10294,BOOK XIII.,"Tried warriors all, he thus addressed his speech:"
10295,BOOK XIII.,
10296,BOOK XIII.,"“Aid me, my friends! alone I stand, and dread"
10297,BOOK XIII.,"The onset of Æneas, swift of foot."
10298,BOOK XIII.,Mighty to slay in battle; and the bloom
10299,BOOK XIII.,"Of youth is his, the crown of human strength;"
10300,BOOK XIII.,"If, as our spirit, our years were but the same,"
10301,BOOK XIII.,"Great glory now should he, or I, obtain.”"
10302,BOOK XIII.,"He said; and, one in heart, their bucklers slop’d"
10303,BOOK XIII.,"Upon their shoulders, all beside him stood."
10304,BOOK XIII.,
10305,BOOK XIII.,"On th’ other side, Æneas to his aid"
10306,BOOK XIII.,"Summon’d his brother chiefs, Deiphobus,"
10307,BOOK XIII.,"And Paris, and Agenor; following whom"
10308,BOOK XIII.,Came on the gen’ral crowd; as flocks of sheep
10309,BOOK XIII.,From pasture follow to their drinking-place
10310,BOOK XIII.,The lordly ram; well pleas’d the shepherd sees;
10311,BOOK XIII.,"So pleas’d, Æneas saw the gath’ring crowd."
10312,BOOK XIII.,Then o’er Alcathous hand to hand was wag’d
10313,BOOK XIII.,The war of spears; dire was the clash of brass
10314,BOOK XIII.,"Upon the heroes’ breasts, as ’mid the press"
10315,BOOK XIII.,Each aim’d at other; proudly eminent
10316,BOOK XIII.,"Stood forth two mighty warriors, terrible"
10317,BOOK XIII.,"As Mars, Æneas and Idomeneus,"
10318,BOOK XIII.,Their sharp spears wielding each at other’s life.
10319,BOOK XIII.,First at Idomeneus Æneas threw
10320,BOOK XIII.,"His spear; he saw, and shunn’d the brazen point;"
10321,BOOK XIII.,"And vainly from his stalwart hand dismiss’d,"
10322,BOOK XIII.,Æneas’ spear stood quiv’ring in the ground.
10323,BOOK XIII.,"Idomeneus in front, below the waist,"
10324,BOOK XIII.,Œnomaus struck; the weighty spear broke through
10325,BOOK XIII.,"The hollow breastplate, and th’ intestines tore;"
10326,BOOK XIII.,"Prone in the dust he fell, and clutch’d the ground."
10327,BOOK XIII.,Forthwith Idomeneus from out the corpse
10328,BOOK XIII.,The pond’rous spear withdrew; yet could not strip
10329,BOOK XIII.,His armour off; so thickly flew the spears.
10330,BOOK XIII.,"Nor did his feet retain their youthful force,"
10331,BOOK XIII.,"His weapon to regain, or back to spring."
10332,BOOK XIII.,"Skill’d in the standing fight his life to guard,"
10333,BOOK XIII.,He lack’d the active pow’r of swift retreat.
10334,BOOK XIII.,"At him, retiring slow, Deiphobus,"
10335,BOOK XIII.,"Still fill’d with anger, threw his glitt’ring spear:"
10336,BOOK XIII.,His aim he miss’d; but through the shoulder pierc’d
10337,BOOK XIII.,"Ascalaphus, a valiant son of Mars;"
10338,BOOK XIII.,"Prone in the dust he fell, and clutch’d the ground."
10339,BOOK XIII.,"Nor knew the loud-voic’d, mighty God of War"
10340,BOOK XIII.,That in the stubborn fight his son had fall’n;
10341,BOOK XIII.,"On high Olympus, girt with golden clouds,"
10342,BOOK XIII.,"He sat, amid th’ Immortals all, restrain’d,"
10343,BOOK XIII.,"By Jove’s commands, from mingling in the war."
10344,BOOK XIII.,How hand to hand around Ascalaphus
10345,BOOK XIII.,Rag’d the fierce conflict: first Deiphobus
10346,BOOK XIII.,From off his head the glitt’ring helmet tore;
10347,BOOK XIII.,"But, terrible as Mars, Meriones"
10348,BOOK XIII.,"Sprang forth, and pierc’d his arm; and from his hand"
10349,BOOK XIII.,With hollow sound the crested helmet fell.
10350,BOOK XIII.,"On, like a vulture, sprang Meriones,"
10351,BOOK XIII.,And from his arm the sturdy spear withdrew;
10352,BOOK XIII.,Then backward leap’d amid his comrades’ ranks;
10353,BOOK XIII.,While round his brother’s waist Polites threw
10354,BOOK XIII.,"His arms, and led him from the battle-field"
10355,BOOK XIII.,"To where, with charioteer and rich-wrought car,"
10356,BOOK XIII.,"Beyond the fight, his flying coursers stood."
10357,BOOK XIII.,"Him, rack’d with pain, and groaning, while the blood"
10358,BOOK XIII.,"Stream’d down his wounded arm, to Troy they bore."
10359,BOOK XIII.,"The rest fought on, and loud the tumult rose."
10360,BOOK XIII.,
10361,BOOK XIII.,"Æneas through the throat of Aphareus,"
10362,BOOK XIII.,"Caletor’s son, turn’d sideways tow’rds him, drove"
10363,BOOK XIII.,"His glitt’ring spear; and down on th’ other side,"
10364,BOOK XIII.,"His shield and helmet following, sank his head;"
10365,BOOK XIII.,And o’er his eyes were cast the shades of death.
10366,BOOK XIII.,"As Thoon turn’d, Antilochus, who watch’d"
10367,BOOK XIII.,"Th’ occasion, forward sprang, and with his spear"
10368,BOOK XIII.,Ripp’d all the flesh that lay along the spine
10369,BOOK XIII.,"Up to the neck; he backward fell, with hands"
10370,BOOK XIII.,Uplifted calling for his comrades’ aid:
10371,BOOK XIII.,"But forward sprang Antilochus, and tore"
10372,BOOK XIII.,"His armour from his breast, while round he cast"
10373,BOOK XIII.,His watchful glances; for on ev’ry side
10374,BOOK XIII.,"On his broad shield the Trojans show’r’d their blows,"
10375,BOOK XIII.,"But touch’d him not; for Neptune, ’mid the throng"
10376,BOOK XIII.,"Of weapons, threw his guard o’er Nestor’s son."
10377,BOOK XIII.,"Yet not aloof he stood, but in their midst,"
10378,BOOK XIII.,Commingled; nor held motionless his spear;
10379,BOOK XIII.,"But ever threat’ning, turn’d from side to side,"
10380,BOOK XIII.,"Prepar’d to hurl, or hand to hand engage."
10381,BOOK XIII.,"Him Adamas, the son of Asius, marked,"
10382,BOOK XIII.,"As o’er the crowd he glanc’d; and springing forth,"
10383,BOOK XIII.,Struck with his spear the centre of the shield;
10384,BOOK XIII.,"But dark-hair’d Neptune grudg’d the hero’s life,"
10385,BOOK XIII.,"And stay’d the brazen point; half in the shield,"
10386,BOOK XIII.,"Like a fire-harden’d stake, remained infix’d,"
10387,BOOK XIII.,"The other half lay broken, on the ground."
10388,BOOK XIII.,"Back to his comrades’ shelt’ring ranks he sprang,"
10389,BOOK XIII.,"In hope of safety; but Meriones,"
10390,BOOK XIII.,"Quick-following, plung’d his weapon through his groin,"
10391,BOOK XIII.,Where sharpest agony to wretched men
10392,BOOK XIII.,Attends on death; there planted he his spear:
10393,BOOK XIII.,"Around the shaft he writh’d, and gasping groan’d,"
10394,BOOK XIII.,"Like to a mountain bull, which, bound with cords,"
10395,BOOK XIII.,"The herdsmen drag along, with struggles vain,"
10396,BOOK XIII.,Resisting; so the wounded warrior groan’d:
10397,BOOK XIII.,"But not for long: for fierce Meriones,"
10398,BOOK XIII.,"Approaching, from his body tore the spear,"
10399,BOOK XIII.,And the dark shades of death his eyes o’erspread.
10400,BOOK XIII.,"Then Helenus, a weighty Thracian sword"
10401,BOOK XIII.,"Wielding aloft, across the temples smote"
10402,BOOK XIII.,"Deipyrus, and all his helmet crash’d;"
10403,BOOK XIII.,"Which, as it roll’d beneath their feet, some Greek"
10404,BOOK XIII.,Seiz’d ’mid the press; his eyes were clos’d in death.
10405,BOOK XIII.,"The valiant Menelaus, Atreus’ son,"
10406,BOOK XIII.,With grief beheld; and royal Helenus
10407,BOOK XIII.,"With threat’ning mien approaching, pois’d on high"
10408,BOOK XIII.,"His glitt’ring spear, while he the bowstring drew."
10409,BOOK XIII.,Then simultaneous flew from either side
10410,BOOK XIII.,"The gleaming spear, and arrow from the string."
10411,BOOK XIII.,The shaft of Priam’s son below the breast
10412,BOOK XIII.,"The hollow cuirass struck, and bounded off;"
10413,BOOK XIII.,"As bound the dark-skinn’d beans, or clatt’ring peas,"
10414,BOOK XIII.,"From the broad fan upon the threshing-floor,"
10415,BOOK XIII.,"By the brisk breeze impell’d, and winnower’s force;"
10416,BOOK XIII.,From noble Menelaus’ cuirass so
10417,BOOK XIII.,"The stinging arrow bounding, glanc’d afar."
10418,BOOK XIII.,"But valiant Menelaus, Atreus’ son,"
10419,BOOK XIII.,Transfix’d the hand that held the polish’d bow:
10420,BOOK XIII.,"The brazen point pass’d through, and to the bow"
10421,BOOK XIII.,The hand was pinn’d; back to his comrades’ ranks
10422,BOOK XIII.,"He sprang, in hope of safety, hanging down"
10423,BOOK XIII.,"The wounded limb, that trail’d the ashen spear."
10424,BOOK XIII.,"Agenor from the wound the spear withdrew,"
10425,BOOK XIII.,"And with a twisted sling of woollen cloth,"
10426,BOOK XIII.,"By an attendant brought, bound up the hand."
10427,BOOK XIII.,To noble Menelaus stood oppos’d
10428,BOOK XIII.,"Peisander, to the confines dark of death"
10429,BOOK XIII.,"Led by his evil fate, by thee to fall,"
10430,BOOK XIII.,"Great son of Atreus, in the deadly strife."
10431,BOOK XIII.,"When near they drew, Atrides miss’d his aim,"
10432,BOOK XIII.,With erring spear divergent; next his shield
10433,BOOK XIII.,"Peisander struck, but drove not through the spear;"
10434,BOOK XIII.,"For the broad shield resisted, and the shaft"
10435,BOOK XIII.,Was snapp’d in sunder: Menelaus saw
10436,BOOK XIII.,"Rejoicing, and with hope of triumph flush’d;"
10437,BOOK XIII.,Unsheathing then his silver-studded sword
10438,BOOK XIII.,Rush’d on Peisander; he beneath his shield
10439,BOOK XIII.,"Drew forth a pond’rous brazen battle-axe,"
10440,BOOK XIII.,"With handle long, of polish’d olive-wood:"
10441,BOOK XIII.,And both at once in deadly combat join’d.
10442,BOOK XIII.,"Then, just below the plume, Peisander struck"
10443,BOOK XIII.,The crested helmet’s peak; but Atreus’ son
10444,BOOK XIII.,"Met him advancing, and across the brow"
10445,BOOK XIII.,"Smote him, above the nose; loud crash’d the bone,"
10446,BOOK XIII.,And in the dust the gory eyeballs dropp’d
10447,BOOK XIII.,"Before him; doubled with the pain, he fell:"
10448,BOOK XIII.,"The victor, planting on his chest his foot,"
10449,BOOK XIII.,"Stripp’d off his arms, and thus exulting cried:"
10450,BOOK XIII.,"“Thus shall ye all, insatiate of the fight,"
10451,BOOK XIII.,"Proud Trojans, from before our ships depart;"
10452,BOOK XIII.,"Nor lack your share of insult and of wrong,"
10453,BOOK XIII.,"Such as on me, vile hounds, ye cast erewhile,"
10454,BOOK XIII.,Nor fear’d th’ avenger of the slighted laws
10455,BOOK XIII.,"Of hospitality, high thund’ring Jove,"
10456,BOOK XIII.,Who soon your lofty city shall o’erthrow.
10457,BOOK XIII.,"Kindly receiv’d, my virgin-wedded wife,"
10458,BOOK XIII.,"With store of goods, ye basely bore away;"
10459,BOOK XIII.,"And now ye rage, infuriate, to destroy"
10460,BOOK XIII.,"With fire our ocean-going ships, and slay"
10461,BOOK XIII.,Our Grecian heroes; but the time shall come
10462,BOOK XIII.,When ye too fain would from the war escape.
10463,BOOK XIII.,"O Father Jove, ’tis said that thou excell’st,"
10464,BOOK XIII.,"In wisdom, Gods and men; all human things"
10465,BOOK XIII.,"From thee proceed; and can it be, that thou"
10466,BOOK XIII.,"With favour seest these men of violence,"
10467,BOOK XIII.,"These Trojans, with presumptuous courage fill’d,"
10468,BOOK XIII.,Whose rage for the battle knows nor stint nor bound?
10469,BOOK XIII.,Men are with all things sated; sleep and love;
10470,BOOK XIII.,"Sweet sounds of music, and the joyous dance."
10471,BOOK XIII.,Of these may some more gladly take their fill;
10472,BOOK XIII.,"But Trojans still for war, instiate, thirst.”"
10473,BOOK XIII.,
10474,BOOK XIII.,Thus Menelaus; and the blood-stained arms
10475,BOOK XIII.,"Stripp’d from the corpse, and to his comrades gave;"
10476,BOOK XIII.,Then join’d again the foremost in the fray.
10477,BOOK XIII.,"There to th’ encounter forth Harpalion sprang,"
10478,BOOK XIII.,"Son of the King Pylaemenes, who came,"
10479,BOOK XIII.,"His father following, to the war of Troy,"
10480,BOOK XIII.,But back return’d not to his native land.
10481,BOOK XIII.,"He standing near, full in the centre struck"
10482,BOOK XIII.,"Atrides’ shield, but drove not through the spear;"
10483,BOOK XIII.,Back to his comrades’ shelt’ring ranks he sprang
10484,BOOK XIII.,"In hopes of safety, glancing all around,"
10485,BOOK XIII.,"His body to defend; but as he turn’d,"
10486,BOOK XIII.,"In his right flank a brazen-pointed shaft,"
10487,BOOK XIII.,"Shot by Meriones, was buried deep:"
10488,BOOK XIII.,"Beneath the bone it pass’d, and pierc’d him through."
10489,BOOK XIII.,"At once he fell; and gasping out his life,"
10490,BOOK XIII.,"Amid his comrades, writhing on the ground"
10491,BOOK XIII.,Like a crush’d worm he lay; and from the wound
10492,BOOK XIII.,"The dark blood pouring, drench’d the thirsty soil."
10493,BOOK XIII.,
10494,BOOK XIII.,The valiant troops of Paphlagonia clos’d
10495,BOOK XIII.,Around him; on his car they plac’d the slain.
10496,BOOK XIII.,"And deeply sorrowing, to the city bore;"
10497,BOOK XIII.,"His father, weeping, walk’d beside the car,[4]"
10498,BOOK XIII.,Nor vengeance for his slaughter’d son obtain’d.
10499,BOOK XIII.,Paris with grief and anger saw him fall:
10500,BOOK XIII.,For he in former days his guest had been
10501,BOOK XIII.,"In Paphlagonia; then, with anger fill’d,"
10502,BOOK XIII.,A brass-tipp’d arrow from his bow he sent.
10503,BOOK XIII.,
10504,BOOK XIII.,"A certain man there was, Euchenor nam’d,"
10505,BOOK XIII.,"Who dwelt in Corinth; rich, of blameless life,"
10506,BOOK XIII.,"The son of Polyeidus, skilful seer:"
10507,BOOK XIII.,"His fate well knowing, he embark’d; for oft"
10508,BOOK XIII.,The good old man had told him that his doom
10509,BOOK XIII.,"Was, or at home by sharp disease to die,"
10510,BOOK XIII.,Or with the Greeks by Trojan hands to fall.
10511,BOOK XIII.,"Embarking, he escap’d alike the fine"
10512,BOOK XIII.,"By Greeks impos’d, and pangs of sharp disease."
10513,BOOK XIII.,Him Paris smote between the ear and jaw;
10514,BOOK XIII.,"Swift fled his spirit, and darkness clos’d his eyes."
10515,BOOK XIII.,"Thus rag’d, like blazing fire, the furious fight."
10516,BOOK XIII.,
10517,BOOK XIII.,"But nought as yet had Hector heard, nor knew"
10518,BOOK XIII.,"How sorely, leftward of the ships, were press’d"
10519,BOOK XIII.,The Trojans by the Greeks; and now appear’d
10520,BOOK XIII.,"Their triumph, sure; such succour Neptune gave,"
10521,BOOK XIII.,"Their courage rousing, and imparting strength."
10522,BOOK XIII.,"But there he kept, where first the serried ranks"
10523,BOOK XIII.,"Of Greeks he broke, and storm’d the wall and gates;"
10524,BOOK XIII.,"There beach’d beside the hoary sea, the ships"
10525,BOOK XIII.,Of Ajax and Protesilaus lay;
10526,BOOK XIII.,There had the wall been lowest built; and there
10527,BOOK XIII.,"Were gather’d in defence the chiefest all,"
10528,BOOK XIII.,"Horses and men: the stout Bœotians there,"
10529,BOOK XIII.,"Join’d to th’ Ionians with their flowing robes,"
10530,BOOK XIII.,"Loerians, and Phthians, and Epeians proud,"
10531,BOOK XIII.,Could scarce protect their ships; nor could repel
10532,BOOK XIII.,Th’ impetuous fire of godlike Hector’s charge.
10533,BOOK XIII.,There too the choicest troops of Athens fought;
10534,BOOK XIII.,"Their chief, Menestheus, Peteus’ son; with whom"
10535,BOOK XIII.,"Were Pheidas, Stichius, Bias in command;"
10536,BOOK XIII.,"Th’ Epeians Meges, Phyleus’ son, obey’d,"
10537,BOOK XIII.,"And Dracius and Amphion; Medon next,"
10538,BOOK XIII.,With brave Podarces led the Phthian host:
10539,BOOK XIII.,"Medon, the great Oileus’ bastard son,"
10540,BOOK XIII.,"Brother of Ajax; he in Phylace,"
10541,BOOK XIII.,"Far from his native land, was driv’n to dwell,"
10542,BOOK XIII.,"Since one to Eriopis near akin,"
10543,BOOK XIII.,"His sire Oileus’ wife, his hand had slain."
10544,BOOK XIII.,"Podarces from Iphiclus claim’d his birth,"
10545,BOOK XIII.,The son of Phylacus; these two in arms
10546,BOOK XIII.,"The valiant Phthians leading to the fight,"
10547,BOOK XIII.,Join’d the Bœotian troops to guard the ships.
10548,BOOK XIII.,But from the side of Ajax Telamon
10549,BOOK XIII.,Stirr’d not a whit Oileus’ active son;
10550,BOOK XIII.,"But as on fallow-land with one accord,"
10551,BOOK XIII.,"Two dark-red oxen drag the well-wrought plough,"
10552,BOOK XIII.,Streaming with sweat that gathers round their horns;
10553,BOOK XIII.,"They by the polish’d yoke together held,"
10554,BOOK XIII.,"The stiff soil cleaving, down the furrow strain;"
10555,BOOK XIII.,"So closely, side by side, those two advanc’d."
10556,BOOK XIII.,"But comrades, many and brave, on Telamon"
10557,BOOK XIII.,"Attended, who, whene’er with toil and sweat"
10558,BOOK XIII.,"His limbs grew faint, upheld his weighty shield;"
10559,BOOK XIII.,"While in the fray, Oileus’ noble son"
10560,BOOK XIII.,No Locrians follow’d; theirs were not the hearts
10561,BOOK XIII.,To brook th’ endurance of the standing fight;
10562,BOOK XIII.,"Nor had they brass-bound helms, with horsehair plume,"
10563,BOOK XIII.,"Nor ample shields they bore, nor ashen spear;"
10564,BOOK XIII.,"But came to Troy, in bows and twisted slings"
10565,BOOK XIII.,Of woollen cloth confiding; and from these
10566,BOOK XIII.,"Their bolts quick-show’ring, broke the Trojan ranks."
10567,BOOK XIII.,"While those, in front, in glitt’ring arms oppos’d"
10568,BOOK XIII.,"The men of Troy, by noble Hector led:"
10569,BOOK XIII.,"These, in the rear, unseen, their arrows shot."
10570,BOOK XIII.,Nor stood the Trojans; for amid their ranks
10571,BOOK XIII.,The galling arrows dire confusion spread.
10572,BOOK XIII.,Then had the Trojans from the ships and tents
10573,BOOK XIII.,Back to the breezy heights of Troy been driv’n
10574,BOOK XIII.,In flight disastrous; but Polydamas
10575,BOOK XIII.,"Drew near to Hector, and address’d him thus:"
10576,BOOK XIII.,
10577,BOOK XIII.,"“Hector, I know thee, how unapt thou art"
10578,BOOK XIII.,To hearken to advice; because the Gods
10579,BOOK XIII.,"Have giv’n thee to excel in warlike might,"
10580,BOOK XIII.,"Thou deemest thyself, in counsel too, supreme;"
10581,BOOK XIII.,Yet every gift thou canst not so combine:
10582,BOOK XIII.,"To one the Gods have granted warlike might,"
10583,BOOK XIII.,"To one the dance, to one the lyre and song;"
10584,BOOK XIII.,While in another’s breast all-seeing Jove
10585,BOOK XIII.,"Hath plac’d the spirit of wisdom, and a mind"
10586,BOOK XIII.,"Discerning, for the common good of all:"
10587,BOOK XIII.,By him are states preserv’d; and he himself
10588,BOOK XIII.,Best knows the value of the precious gift.
10589,BOOK XIII.,Then hear what seems to me the wisest course.
10590,BOOK XIII.,On ev’ry side the circling ring of war
10591,BOOK XIII.,"Is blazing all around thee; and, thou seest,"
10592,BOOK XIII.,"Our valiant Trojans, since the wall they scal’d,"
10593,BOOK XIII.,"Or stand aloof, or scatter’d ’mid the ships"
10594,BOOK XIII.,"Outnumber’d, with superior forces strive."
10595,BOOK XIII.,"Then thou, retiring, hither call the chiefs;"
10596,BOOK XIII.,"Here take we counsel fully, if to fall"
10597,BOOK XIII.,"Upon their well-mann’d ships, should Heaven vouchsafe"
10598,BOOK XIII.,"The needful strength, or, scatheless yet, withdraw;"
10599,BOOK XIII.,For much I fear they soon will pay us back
10600,BOOK XIII.,Their debt of yesterday; since in their ranks
10601,BOOK XIII.,"One yet remains insatiate of the fight,"
10602,BOOK XIII.,"And he, methinks, not long will stand aloof.”"
10603,BOOK XIII.,
10604,BOOK XIII.,Thus he: the prudent counsel Hector pleas’d;
10605,BOOK XIII.,"Down from his chariot with his arms he leap’d,"
10606,BOOK XIII.,And to Polydamas his speech address’d:
10607,BOOK XIII.,
10608,BOOK XIII.,"“Polydamas, detain thou here the chiefs;"
10609,BOOK XIII.,"Thither will I, and meet the front of war,"
10610,BOOK XIII.,"And, giv’n my orders, quickly here return.”"
10611,BOOK XIII.,
10612,BOOK XIII.,"He said; and, like a snow-clad mountain high,"
10613,BOOK XIII.,"Uprose; and loudly shouting, in hot haste"
10614,BOOK XIII.,Flew through the Trojan and Confed’rate host.
10615,BOOK XIII.,"At sound of Hector’s voice, round Panthous’ son,"
10616,BOOK XIII.,"Polydamas, were gather’d all the chiefs."
10617,BOOK XIII.,But ’mid the foremost combatants he sought
10618,BOOK XIII.,"If haply he might find Deiphobus,"
10619,BOOK XIII.,"And royal Helenus, and Adamas,"
10620,BOOK XIII.,"And gallant Asius, son of Hyrtacus."
10621,BOOK XIII.,These found he not unscath’d by wounds or death;
10622,BOOK XIII.,"For some beside the ships of Greece had paid,"
10623,BOOK XIII.,"By Grecian hands, the forfeit of their lives,"
10624,BOOK XIII.,While others wounded lay within the wall.
10625,BOOK XIII.,"But, to the leftward of the bloody fray,"
10626,BOOK XIII.,"The godlike Paris, fair-hair’d Helen’s Lord,"
10627,BOOK XIII.,"Cheering his comrades to the fight, he found,"
10628,BOOK XIII.,And with reproachful words address’d him thus:
10629,BOOK XIII.,
10630,BOOK XIII.,"“Thou wretched Paris, fair in outward form,"
10631,BOOK XIII.,"Thou slave of woman, manhood’s counterfeit,"
10632,BOOK XIII.,"Where is Deiphobus, and where the might"
10633,BOOK XIII.,"Of royal Helenus? where Adamas,"
10634,BOOK XIII.,"The son of Asius? where too Asius, son"
10635,BOOK XIII.,Of Hyrtacus? and where Othryoneus?
10636,BOOK XIII.,Now from its summit totters to the fall
10637,BOOK XIII.,Our lofty Ilium; now thy doom is sure.”
10638,BOOK XIII.,
10639,BOOK XIII.,To whom the godlike Paris thus replied:
10640,BOOK XIII.,"“Hector, since blameless I incur thy blame,"
10641,BOOK XIII.,"Ne’er have I less withdrawn me from the fight,"
10642,BOOK XIII.,And me not wholly vile my mother bore;
10643,BOOK XIII.,"For since thou gav’st command to attack the ships,"
10644,BOOK XIII.,We here against the Greeks unflinching war
10645,BOOK XIII.,"Have wag’d; our comrades, whom thou seek’st, are slain:"
10646,BOOK XIII.,"Only Deiphobus hath left the field,"
10647,BOOK XIII.,"And Helenus; both wounded by the spear,"
10648,BOOK XIII.,Both through the hand; but Jove their life hath spar’d.
10649,BOOK XIII.,"But thou, where’er thy courage bids, lead on:"
10650,BOOK XIII.,We shall be prompt to follow; to our pow’r
10651,BOOK XIII.,Thou shalt in us no lack of valour find;
10652,BOOK XIII.,Beyond his pow’r the bravest cannot fight.”
10653,BOOK XIII.,
10654,BOOK XIII.,Wrought on his brother’s mind the hero’s words:
10655,BOOK XIII.,"Together both they bent their steps, where rag’d"
10656,BOOK XIII.,"The fiercest conflict; there Cebriones,"
10657,BOOK XIII.,"Phalces, Orthaeus, brave Polydamas,"
10658,BOOK XIII.,"Palmys, and godlike Polyphetes’ might,"
10659,BOOK XIII.,"And Morys, and Ascanius fought; these two"
10660,BOOK XIII.,Hippotion’s sons; from rich Ascania’s plains
10661,BOOK XIII.,"They, as reliefs, but yestermorn had come;"
10662,BOOK XIII.,"Impell’d by Jove, they sought the battle field."
10663,BOOK XIII.,"Onward they dash’d, impetuous as the rush"
10664,BOOK XIII.,"Of the fierce whirlwind, which with lightning charg’d,"
10665,BOOK XIII.,From Father Jove sweeps downward o’er the plain:
10666,BOOK XIII.,"As with loud roar it mingles with the sea,"
10667,BOOK XIII.,"The many-dashing ocean’s billows boil,"
10668,BOOK XIII.,"Upheaving, foam-white-crested, wave on wave;"
10669,BOOK XIII.,"So, rank on rank, the Trojans, closely mass’d,"
10670,BOOK XIII.,"In arms all glitt’ring, with their chiefs advanc’d;"
10671,BOOK XIII.,"Hector, the son of Priam, led them on,"
10672,BOOK XIII.,In combat terrible as blood-stain’d Mars:
10673,BOOK XIII.,"Before his breast his shield’s broad orb he bore,"
10674,BOOK XIII.,"Of hides close join’d, with brazen plates o’erlaid;"
10675,BOOK XIII.,The gleaming helmet nodded o’er his brow.
10676,BOOK XIII.,"He, with proud step, protected by his shield,"
10677,BOOK XIII.,"On ev’ry side the hostile ranks survey’d,"
10678,BOOK XIII.,If signs of yielding he might trace; but they
10679,BOOK XIII.,"Unshaken stood; and with like haughty mien,"
10680,BOOK XIII.,Ajax at Hector thus defiance hurl’d:
10681,BOOK XIII.,
10682,BOOK XIII.,"“Draw nearer, mighty chief; why seek to scare"
10683,BOOK XIII.,Our valiant Greeks? we boast ourselves of war
10684,BOOK XIII.,"Not wholly unskill’d, though now the hand of Jove"
10685,BOOK XIII.,Lies heavy on us with the scourge of Heav’n.
10686,BOOK XIII.,"Thou hop’st, forsooth, our vessels to destroy;"
10687,BOOK XIII.,But stalwart arms for their defence we boast.
10688,BOOK XIII.,"Long ere that day shall your proud city fall,"
10689,BOOK XIII.,Tak’n and destroy’d by our victorious hands.
10690,BOOK XIII.,"Not far the hour, when thou thyself in flight"
10691,BOOK XIII.,"To Jove and all the Gods shalt make thy pray’r,"
10692,BOOK XIII.,That swifter than the falcon’s wing thy steeds
10693,BOOK XIII.,May bear thee o’er the dusty plain to Troy.”
10694,BOOK XIII.,
10695,BOOK XIII.,"Thus as he spoke, upon his right appear’d"
10696,BOOK XIII.,"An eagle, soaring high; the crowd of Greeks"
10697,BOOK XIII.,"The fav’ring omen saw, and shouted loud:"
10698,BOOK XIII.,"Then noble Hector thus: “What words are these,"
10699,BOOK XIII.,"Ajax, thou babbling braggart, vain of speech!"
10700,BOOK XIII.,For would to Heav’n I were as well assur’d
10701,BOOK XIII.,"I were the son of aegis-bearing Jove,"
10702,BOOK XIII.,"Born of imperial Juno, and myself"
10703,BOOK XIII.,In equal honour with Apollo held
10704,BOOK XIII.,"Or blue-ey’d Pallas, as I am assur’d"
10705,BOOK XIII.,This day is fraught with ill to all the Greeks:
10706,BOOK XIII.,"Thou ’mid the rest shalt perish, if thou dare"
10707,BOOK XIII.,"My spear encounter, which thy dainty skin"
10708,BOOK XIII.,"Shall rend; and slain beside the ships, thy flesh"
10709,BOOK XIII.,Shall glut the dogs and carrion birds of Troy.”
10710,BOOK XIII.,
10711,BOOK XIII.,"He said, and led them on; with eager cheers"
10712,BOOK XIII.,They followed; shouted loud the hindmost throng.
10713,BOOK XIII.,On th’ other side the Greeks return’d the shout:
10714,BOOK XIII.,"Of all the Trojans’ bravest they, unmov’d,"
10715,BOOK XIII.,The onset bore; their mingled clamours rose
10716,BOOK XIII.,"To Heav’n, and reach’d the glorious light of Jove."

10761,BOOK XIV.,"A sturdy spear too, tipp’d with brass, he took:"
10762,BOOK XIV.,Without the tent he stood; and there his eyes
10763,BOOK XIV.,"A woful sight beheld; the Greeks in flight,"
10764,BOOK XIV.,The haughty Trojans pressing on their rout
10765,BOOK XIV.,Confus’d; the Greeks’ protecting wall o’erthrown.
10766,BOOK XIV.,"As heaves the darkling sea with silent swell,"
10767,BOOK XIV.,Expectant of the boist’rous gale’s approach;
10768,BOOK XIV.,"Nor onward either way is pour’d its flood,"
10769,BOOK XIV.,Until it feel th’ impelling blast from Heav’n;
10770,BOOK XIV.,"So stood th’ old man, his mind perplex’d with doubt,"
10771,BOOK XIV.,"To mingle in the throng, or counsel seek"
10772,BOOK XIV.,"Of mighty Agamemnon, Atreus’ son."
10773,BOOK XIV.,"Thus as he mused, the better course appear’d,"
10774,BOOK XIV.,To seek Atrides; fiercely fought the rest
10775,BOOK XIV.,With mutual slaughter; loud their armour rang
10776,BOOK XIV.,With thrusts of swords and double-pointed spears.
10777,BOOK XIV.,"There Nestor met, advancing from the ships,"
10778,BOOK XIV.,"The Heav’n-born Kings, Ulysses, Diomed,"
10779,BOOK XIV.,"And Agamemnon, son of Atreus, all"
10780,BOOK XIV.,By wounds disabled; for the ships were beach’d
10781,BOOK XIV.,"Upon the shore, beside the hoary sea,"
10782,BOOK XIV.,"Far from the battle; higher, tow’rd the plain"
10783,BOOK XIV.,"The foremost had been drawn, and with a wall"
10784,BOOK XIV.,Their sterns surrounded; for the spacious beach
10785,BOOK XIV.,"Could not contain them, and in narrow bounds"
10786,BOOK XIV.,Were pent their multitudes; so high on land
10787,BOOK XIV.,"They drew, and rang’d them side by side, and fill’d,"
10788,BOOK XIV.,"Within the headlands, all the wide-mouth’d bay."
10789,BOOK XIV.,"Thus they, their steps supporting on their spears,"
10790,BOOK XIV.,"Together came, spectators of the fight;"
10791,BOOK XIV.,"Deep sorrow fill’d their breasts; them Nestor met,"
10792,BOOK XIV.,"The fear increasing, which their souls possess’d."
10793,BOOK XIV.,To whom the monarch Agamemnon thus:
10794,BOOK XIV.,
10795,BOOK XIV.,"“O Nestor, son of Neleus, pride of Greece,"
10796,BOOK XIV.,"Why com’st thou here, and leav’st the battle-field?"
10797,BOOK XIV.,Greatly I fear that noble Hector now
10798,BOOK XIV.,"His menace will fulfil, who made his boast"
10799,BOOK XIV.,"Before th’ assembled Trojans, that to Troy"
10800,BOOK XIV.,"He never would return, until our ships"
10801,BOOK XIV.,"The flames had master’d, and ourselves the sword."
10802,BOOK XIV.,"Such was his threat, and now he makes it good."
10803,BOOK XIV.,"Heav’n! can it be that I of other Greeks,"
10804,BOOK XIV.,"As of Achilles, have incurr’d the wrath,"
10805,BOOK XIV.,Who thence refuse to battle for the ships?”
10806,BOOK XIV.,
10807,BOOK XIV.,To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:
10808,BOOK XIV.,“Such are indeed our prospects; Jove on high
10809,BOOK XIV.,Could to our fortunes give no diff’rent turn.
10810,BOOK XIV.,"The wall is raz’d, wherein our trust we plac’d"
10811,BOOK XIV.,"To guard, impregnable, ourselves and ships;"
10812,BOOK XIV.,"And now around the ships their war they wage,"
10813,BOOK XIV.,"Unceasing, unabated; none might tell"
10814,BOOK XIV.,"By closest scrutiny, which way are driv’n"
10815,BOOK XIV.,"The routed Greeks, so intermix’d they fall"
10816,BOOK XIV.,Promiscuous; and the cry ascends to Heav’n.
10817,BOOK XIV.,"But come, discuss we what may best be done,"
10818,BOOK XIV.,If judgment aught may profit us; ourselves
10819,BOOK XIV.,To mingle in the fray I counsel not;
10820,BOOK XIV.,It were not well for wounded men to fight.”
10821,BOOK XIV.,
10822,BOOK XIV.,"Whom answer’d Agamemnon, King of men:"
10823,BOOK XIV.,"“Nestor, since to the ships the war is brought,"
10824,BOOK XIV.,"Nor hath the wall avail’d to stay their course,"
10825,BOOK XIV.,"Nor yet the deep-dug trench, on which we Greeks"
10826,BOOK XIV.,"Much toil bestow’d, and which we vainly hop’d"
10827,BOOK XIV.,"Might guard, impregnable, ourselves and ships;"
10828,BOOK XIV.,Seems it the will of Saturn’s mighty son
10829,BOOK XIV.,"That, far from Argos, from our native land,"
10830,BOOK XIV.,We all should here in nameless graves be laid.
10831,BOOK XIV.,I knew when once he lov’d to aid the Greeks;
10832,BOOK XIV.,But now I see that to the blessed Gods
10833,BOOK XIV.,"Our foes he equals, and our strength confounds."
10834,BOOK XIV.,Hear then my counsel; let us all agree
10835,BOOK XIV.,The ships that nearest to the sea are beach’d
10836,BOOK XIV.,"To launch upon the main, till nightfall there"
10837,BOOK XIV.,To ride at anchor: if that e’en by night
10838,BOOK XIV.,The Trojans may suspend their fierce assault;
10839,BOOK XIV.,Then may we launch in safety all the fleet.
10840,BOOK XIV.,"No shame it is to fly, although by night,"
10841,BOOK XIV.,Impending evil; better so to fly
10842,BOOK XIV.,Than by the threaten’d danger be o’erta’en.”
10843,BOOK XIV.,
10844,BOOK XIV.,"To whom, with scornful glance, Ulysses sage:"
10845,BOOK XIV.,"“What words have pass’d the barrier of thy lips,"
10846,BOOK XIV.,Thou son of Atreus? counsellor of ill!
10847,BOOK XIV.,Would thou hadst been of some ignoble band
10848,BOOK XIV.,"The leader, not the chief of such a host"
10849,BOOK XIV.,"As ours, on whom, from youth to latest age,"
10850,BOOK XIV.,"Jove hath the gift bestow’d, to bear the brunt"
10851,BOOK XIV.,"Of hardy war, till ev’ry man be slain."
10852,BOOK XIV.,And think’st thou so to leave the lofty walls
10853,BOOK XIV.,"Of Troy, the object of our painful toil?"
10854,BOOK XIV.,"Be silent, that no other Greek may hear"
10855,BOOK XIV.,"Words, which no man might trust his tongue to speak,"
10856,BOOK XIV.,"Who nobler counsels understands, and wields"
10857,BOOK XIV.,"A royal sceptre, and th’ allegiance claims"
10858,BOOK XIV.,"Of numbers, such as those that own thy sway."
10859,BOOK XIV.,Thy counsels all I utterly condemn;
10860,BOOK XIV.,"Who, ’mid the close and clamour of the fight,"
10861,BOOK XIV.,"Wouldst have us launch our ships, and give the foe,"
10862,BOOK XIV.,"Already too triumphant, cause renew’d"
10863,BOOK XIV.,For boasting; then were death our certain lot;
10864,BOOK XIV.,"For, if the ships he launch’d, not long will Greeks"
10865,BOOK XIV.,"Sustain the war, but with reverted eyes"
10866,BOOK XIV.,Shrink from the fight; to such pernicious end
10867,BOOK XIV.,"Would lead thy baneful counsels, mighty chief.”"
10868,BOOK XIV.,
10869,BOOK XIV.,"Whom answer’d Agamemnon, King of men:"
10870,BOOK XIV.,"“Ulysses, thy rebuke hath wrung my soul;"
10871,BOOK XIV.,"Yet never meant I, that against their will"
10872,BOOK XIV.,The sons of Greece should launch their well found ships:
10873,BOOK XIV.,"But if there be who better counsel knows,"
10874,BOOK XIV.,"Or young or old, his words would please me well.”"
10875,BOOK XIV.,
10876,BOOK XIV.,"Then rose the valiant Diomed, and said:"
10877,BOOK XIV.,"“The man is near at hand, nor far to seek,"
10878,BOOK XIV.,"If ye will hear, nor take offence, that I,"
10879,BOOK XIV.,"The youngest of you all, presume to speak."
10880,BOOK XIV.,"Yet of a noble sire I boast me sprung,"
10881,BOOK XIV.,"Tydeus, who sleeps beneath the Theban soil:"
10882,BOOK XIV.,"To Portheus three brave sons were born, who dwelt"
10883,BOOK XIV.,"In Pleuron and in lofty Calydon,"
10884,BOOK XIV.,"Agrius, and Melas; bravest of them all,"
10885,BOOK XIV.,"My father’s father, Œneus, was the third."
10886,BOOK XIV.,"He there remain’d; my father, wand’ring long,"
10887,BOOK XIV.,To Argos came; such was the will of Jove
10888,BOOK XIV.,And of th’ Immortals all; he there espous’d
10889,BOOK XIV.,"Adrastus’ daughter; own’d a wealthy house,"
10890,BOOK XIV.,"With fertile corn-lands round, and orchards stor’d"
10891,BOOK XIV.,"With goodly fruit-trees; num’rous flocks he had,"
10892,BOOK XIV.,And all the Greeks in feats of arms excell’d.
10893,BOOK XIV.,"Hear ye the words I speak, for they are true:"
10894,BOOK XIV.,"And if my speech be wise, despise it not,"
10895,BOOK XIV.,"As of one worthless, or ignobly born."
10896,BOOK XIV.,"Though wounded, to the battle I advise"
10897,BOOK XIV.,That we perforce repair; yet not ourselves
10898,BOOK XIV.,"To join the combat, or confront the spears,"
10899,BOOK XIV.,Lest wounds to wounds be added; but to rouse
10900,BOOK XIV.,"The spirits of some, who, zealous heretofore,"
10901,BOOK XIV.,"How stand aloof, nor mingle in the fray.”"
10902,BOOK XIV.,
10903,BOOK XIV.,"He said, and they, his words approving, went,"
10904,BOOK XIV.,"By Agamemnon led, the King of men."
10905,BOOK XIV.,Nor careless was the watch by Neptune kept:
10906,BOOK XIV.,"With them, in likeness of an aged man,"
10907,BOOK XIV.,"He went, and Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,"
10908,BOOK XIV.,"By the right hand he took, and thus address’d:"
10909,BOOK XIV.,
10910,BOOK XIV.,"“O son of Atreus, great is now the joy"
10911,BOOK XIV.,"With which Achilles’ savage breast is fill’d,"
10912,BOOK XIV.,Who sees the slaughter and the rout of Greeks:
10913,BOOK XIV.,"For nought he has of heart, no, not a whit:"
10914,BOOK XIV.,"But perish he, accursed of the Gods!"
10915,BOOK XIV.,Nor deem thou that to thee the blessed Gods
10916,BOOK XIV.,Are wholly hostile; yet again the chiefs
10917,BOOK XIV.,And councillors of Troy shall scour in flight
10918,BOOK XIV.,The dusty plain; and from the ships and tents
10919,BOOK XIV.,Thine eyes shall see them to the city fly.”
10920,BOOK XIV.,
10921,BOOK XIV.,"He said; and loudly shouting, onward rush’d."
10922,BOOK XIV.,"As of nine thousand or ten thousand men,"
10923,BOOK XIV.,"In deadly combat meeting, is the shout;"
10924,BOOK XIV.,Such was the sound which from his ample chest
10925,BOOK XIV.,Th’ Earth-shaker sent; and ev’ry Greek inspir’d
10926,BOOK XIV.,With stern resolve to wage unflinching war.
10927,BOOK XIV.,
10928,BOOK XIV.,"Standing on high Olympus’ topmost peak,"
10929,BOOK XIV.,"The golden-throned Juno downward look’d,"
10930,BOOK XIV.,"And, busied in the glory-giving strife,"
10931,BOOK XIV.,"Her husband’s brother and her own she saw,"
10932,BOOK XIV.,"Saw, and rejoic’d; next, seated on the crest"
10933,BOOK XIV.,"Of spring-abounding Ida, Jove she saw,"
10934,BOOK XIV.,Sight hateful in her eyes! then ponder’d deep
10935,BOOK XIV.,"The stag-ey’d Queen, how best she might beguile"
10936,BOOK XIV.,The wakeful mind of aegis-bearing Jove;
10937,BOOK XIV.,"And, musing, this appear’d the readiest mode:"
10938,BOOK XIV.,"Herself with art adorning, to repair"
10939,BOOK XIV.,"To Ida; there, with fondest blandishment"
10940,BOOK XIV.,"And female charm, her husband to enfold"
10941,BOOK XIV.,"In love’s embrace; and gentle, careless sleep"
10942,BOOK XIV.,Around his eyelids and his senses pour.
10943,BOOK XIV.,"Her chamber straight she sought, by Vulcan built,"
10944,BOOK XIV.,Her son; by whom were to the door-posts hung
10945,BOOK XIV.,"Close-fitting doors, with secret keys secur’d,"
10946,BOOK XIV.,"That, save herself, no God might enter in."
10947,BOOK XIV.,"There enter’d she, and clos’d the shining doors;"
10948,BOOK XIV.,And with ambrosia first her lovely skin
10949,BOOK XIV.,"She purified, with fragrant oil anointing,"
10950,BOOK XIV.,"Ambrosial, breathing forth such odours sweet,"
10951,BOOK XIV.,"That, wav’d above the brazen floor of Jove,"
10952,BOOK XIV.,All earth and Heav’n were with the fragrance fill’d;
10953,BOOK XIV.,O’er her fair skin this precious oil she spread;
10954,BOOK XIV.,"Comb’d out her flowing locks, and with her hand"
10955,BOOK XIV.,"Wreath’d the thick masses of the glossy hair,"
10956,BOOK XIV.,"Immortal, bright, that crown’d th’ imperial head."
10957,BOOK XIV.,"A robe ambrosial then, by Pallas wrought,"
10958,BOOK XIV.,"She donn’d, in many a curious pattern trac’d,"
10959,BOOK XIV.,With golden brooch beneath her breast confin’d.
10960,BOOK XIV.,"Her zone, from which a hundred tassels hung,"
10961,BOOK XIV.,"She girt about her; and, in three bright drops,"
10962,BOOK XIV.,Her glitt’ring gems suspended from her ears;
10963,BOOK XIV.,And all around her grace and beauty shone.
10964,BOOK XIV.,Then o’er her head th’ imperial Goddess threw
10965,BOOK XIV.,"A beauteous veil, new-wrought, as sunlight white;"
10966,BOOK XIV.,And on her well-turn’d feet her sandals bound.
10967,BOOK XIV.,"Her dress completed, from her chamber forth"
10968,BOOK XIV.,"She issued, and from th’ other Gods apart"
10969,BOOK XIV.,"She call’d to Venus, and address’d her thus:"
10970,BOOK XIV.,"“Say, wilt thou grant, dear child, the boon I ask?"
10971,BOOK XIV.,"Or wilt thou say me nay, in wrath that I"
10972,BOOK XIV.,"Espouse the Greek, as thou the Trojan cause?”"
10973,BOOK XIV.,
10974,BOOK XIV.,To whom the laughter-loving Venus thus:
10975,BOOK XIV.,"“Daughter of Saturn, Juno, mighty Queen,"
10976,BOOK XIV.,Tell me thy wish; to grant it if my pow’r
10977,BOOK XIV.,"May aught avail, thy pleasure shall be done.”"
10978,BOOK XIV.,
10979,BOOK XIV.,"To whom great Juno thus, with artful speech:"
10980,BOOK XIV.,"“Give me the loveliness, and pow’r to charm,"
10981,BOOK XIV.,Whereby thou reign’st o’er Gods and men supreme.
10982,BOOK XIV.,For to the bounteous Earth’s extremest bounds
10983,BOOK XIV.,"I go, to visit old Oceanus,"
10984,BOOK XIV.,"The sire of Gods, and Tethys, who of yore"
10985,BOOK XIV.,"From Rhaea took me, when all-seeing Jove"
10986,BOOK XIV.,"Hurl’d Saturn down below the earth and seas,"
10987,BOOK XIV.,And nurs’d me in their home with tend’rest care;
10988,BOOK XIV.,"I go to visit them, and reconcile"
10989,BOOK XIV.,A lengthen’d feud; for since some cause of wrath
10990,BOOK XIV.,"Has come between them, they from rites of love"
10991,BOOK XIV.,And from the marriage-bed have long abstain’d:
10992,BOOK XIV.,"Could I unite them by persuasive words,"
10993,BOOK XIV.,"And to their former intercourse restore,"
10994,BOOK XIV.,Their love and rev’rence were for ever mine.”
10995,BOOK XIV.,
10996,BOOK XIV.,Whom answer’d thus the laughter-loving Queen:
10997,BOOK XIV.,"“I ought not, and I cannot, say thee nay,"
10998,BOOK XIV.,Who liest encircled by the arms of Jove.”
10999,BOOK XIV.,
11000,BOOK XIV.,Thus Venus spoke; and from her bosom loos’d
11001,BOOK XIV.,"Her broider’d cestus, wrought with ev’ry charm"
11002,BOOK XIV.,"To win the heart; there Love, there young Desire,"
11003,BOOK XIV.,"There fond Discourse, and there Persuasion dwelt,"
11004,BOOK XIV.,Which oft enthralls the mind of wisest men.
11005,BOOK XIV.,"This in her hand she plac’d, as thus she spoke:"
11006,BOOK XIV.,"“Take thou from me, and in thy bosom hide,"
11007,BOOK XIV.,"This broider’d cestus; and, whate’er thy wish,"
11008,BOOK XIV.,Thou shalt not here ungratified return.”
11009,BOOK XIV.,
11010,BOOK XIV.,"Thus Venus; smil’d the stag-ey’d Queen of Heav’n,"
11011,BOOK XIV.,"And, smiling, in her bosom hid the gift."
11012,BOOK XIV.,Then Venus to her father’s house return’d;
11013,BOOK XIV.,But Juno down from high Olympus sped;
11014,BOOK XIV.,"O’er sweet Emathia, and Pieria’s range,"
11015,BOOK XIV.,"O’er snowy mountains of horse-breeding Thrace,"
11016,BOOK XIV.,"Their topmost heights, she soar’d, nor touch’d the earth."
11017,BOOK XIV.,"From Athos then she cross’d the swelling sea,"
11018,BOOK XIV.,"Until to Lemnos, godlike Thoas’ seat,"
11019,BOOK XIV.,"She came; there met she Sleep, twin-born with Death,"
11020,BOOK XIV.,"Whom, as his hand she clasp’d, she thus address’d:"
11021,BOOK XIV.,
11022,BOOK XIV.,"“Sleep, universal King of Gods and men,"
11023,BOOK XIV.,"If ever thou hast listen’d to my voice,"
11024,BOOK XIV.,"Grant me the boon which now I ask, and win"
11025,BOOK XIV.,My ceaseless favour in all time to come.
11026,BOOK XIV.,"When Jove thou seest in my embraces lock’d,"
11027,BOOK XIV.,Do thou his piercing eyes in slumber seal.
11028,BOOK XIV.,"Rich guerdon shall be thine; a gorgeous throne,"
11029,BOOK XIV.,"Immortal, golden; which my skilful son,"
11030,BOOK XIV.,"Vulcan, shall deftly frame; beneath, a stool"
11031,BOOK XIV.,Whereon at feasts thy feet may softly rest.”
11032,BOOK XIV.,
11033,BOOK XIV.,Whom answer’d thus the gentle God of Sleep:
11034,BOOK XIV.,"“Daughter of Saturn, Juno, mighty Queen,"
11035,BOOK XIV.,On any other of th’ immortal Gods
11036,BOOK XIV.,I can with ease exert my slumb’rous pow’r;
11037,BOOK XIV.,"Even to the stream of old Oceanus,"
11038,BOOK XIV.,"Prime origin of all; but Saturn’s son,"
11039,BOOK XIV.,"Imperial Jove, I dare not so approach,"
11040,BOOK XIV.,"Nor sink in sleep, save by his own desire."
11041,BOOK XIV.,"Already once, obeying thy command,"
11042,BOOK XIV.,"A fearful warning I receiv’d, that day"
11043,BOOK XIV.,When from the capture and the sack of Troy
11044,BOOK XIV.,"That mighty warrior, son of Jove, set sail;"
11045,BOOK XIV.,"For, circumfus’d around, with sweet constraint"
11046,BOOK XIV.,"I bound the sense of aegis-bearing Jove,"
11047,BOOK XIV.,"While thou, with ill-design, rousing the force"
11048,BOOK XIV.,"Of winds tempestuous o’er the stormy sea,"
11049,BOOK XIV.,"Didst cast him forth on Coos’ thriving isle,"
11050,BOOK XIV.,"Far from his friends; then Jove, awaking, pour’d"
11051,BOOK XIV.,"His wrath, promiscuous, on th’ assembled Gods;"
11052,BOOK XIV.,Me chief his anger sought; and from on high
11053,BOOK XIV.,"Had hurl’d me, plung’d beneath th’ unfathom’d sea,"
11054,BOOK XIV.,"But Night, the vanquisher of Gods and men,"
11055,BOOK XIV.,Her fugitive received me; he his wrath
11056,BOOK XIV.,"Repress’d, unwilling to invade the claims"
11057,BOOK XIV.,Of holy Night; and now thou fain wouldst urge
11058,BOOK XIV.,That I another reckless deed essay.”
11059,BOOK XIV.,
11060,BOOK XIV.,Whom answer’d thus the stag-ey’d Queen of Heav’n:
11061,BOOK XIV.,"“Why, Sleep, with thoughts like these perplex thy mind"
11062,BOOK XIV.,Think’st thou that Jove as ardently desires
11063,BOOK XIV.,"To aid the men of Troy, as fiercely burn’d"
11064,BOOK XIV.,His anger on his valiant son’s behalf?
11065,BOOK XIV.,"Grant my request; and of the Graces one,"
11066,BOOK XIV.,"The youngest and the fairest, have to wife,"
11067,BOOK XIV.,"Pasithea, whom thy love hath long pursued.”"
11068,BOOK XIV.,
11069,BOOK XIV.,"Thus promis’d Juno; Sleep, rejoicing, heard,"
11070,BOOK XIV.,And answer’d thus: “Swear then the awful oath.
11071,BOOK XIV.,"Inviolable, by the stream of Styx,"
11072,BOOK XIV.,"Thy one hand laid upon the fruitful earth,"
11073,BOOK XIV.,The other resting on the sparkling sea;
11074,BOOK XIV.,That all the Gods who in the nether realms
11075,BOOK XIV.,"With Saturn dwell, may of our solemn bond"
11076,BOOK XIV.,"Be witnesses, that of the Graces one,"
11077,BOOK XIV.,"The youngest, fairest, I shall have to wife,"
11078,BOOK XIV.,"Pasithea, whom my love hath long pursued.”"
11079,BOOK XIV.,
11080,BOOK XIV.,He said: nor did the white-arm’d Queen refuse;
11081,BOOK XIV.,She took the oath requir’d; and call’d by name
11082,BOOK XIV.,"On all the Titans, sub-Tartarean Gods:"
11083,BOOK XIV.,"Then, sworn and ratified the oath, they pass’d"
11084,BOOK XIV.,"From Lemnos, and from Imbros, veil’d in cloud,"
11085,BOOK XIV.,"Skimming their airy way; on Lectum first,"
11086,BOOK XIV.,"In spring-abounding Ida, nurse of beasts,"
11087,BOOK XIV.,"The sea they left, and journey’d o’er the land,"
11088,BOOK XIV.,While wav’d beneath their feet the lofty woods.
11089,BOOK XIV.,"There Sleep, ere yet he met the eye of Jove,"
11090,BOOK XIV.,"Remain’d; and, mounted on a lofty pine,"
11091,BOOK XIV.,"The tallest growth of Ida, that on high"
11092,BOOK XIV.,"Flung through the desert air its boughs to Heav’n,"
11093,BOOK XIV.,Amid the pine’s close branches lay ensconc’d;
11094,BOOK XIV.,"Like to a mountain bird of shrillest note,"
11095,BOOK XIV.,"Whom Gods the Chalcis, men the night-hawk call."
11096,BOOK XIV.,"Juno meanwhile to Ida’s summit sped,"
11097,BOOK XIV.,To Gargarus; the Cloud-compeller saw;
11098,BOOK XIV.,"He saw, and sudden passion fir’d his soul,"
11099,BOOK XIV.,"As when, their parents’ eyes eluding, first"
11100,BOOK XIV.,They tasted of the secret joys of love.
11101,BOOK XIV.,"He rose to meet her, and address’d her thus:"
11102,BOOK XIV.,
11103,BOOK XIV.,"“From high Olympus, Juno, whither bound,"
11104,BOOK XIV.,"And how, to Ida hast thou come in haste?"
11105,BOOK XIV.,For horses here or chariot hast thou none.”
11106,BOOK XIV.,
11107,BOOK XIV.,To whom thus Juno with deceitful speech
11108,BOOK XIV.,Replied: “To fertile earth’s extremest bounds
11109,BOOK XIV.,"I go, to visit old Oceanus,"
11110,BOOK XIV.,"The sire of Gods, and Tethys, who of yore"
11111,BOOK XIV.,"Receiv’d, and nurtur’d me with tend’rest care."
11112,BOOK XIV.,"I go to visit them, and reconcile"
11113,BOOK XIV.,A lengthen’d feud; for since some cause of wrath
11114,BOOK XIV.,"Has come between them, they from rites of love"
11115,BOOK XIV.,And from the marriage-bed have long abstain’d.
11116,BOOK XIV.,Meanwhile at spring-abounding Ida’s foot
11117,BOOK XIV.,"My horses wait me, that o’er land and sea"
11118,BOOK XIV.,Alike my chariot bear; on thine account
11119,BOOK XIV.,"From high Olympus hither have I come,"
11120,BOOK XIV.,"Lest it displease thee, if, to thee unknown,"
11121,BOOK XIV.,I sought the Ocean’s deeply-flowing stream.”
11122,BOOK XIV.,To whom the Cloud-compeller thus replied:
11123,BOOK XIV.,"“Juno, thy visit yet awhile defer;"
11124,BOOK XIV.,And let us now in love’s delights indulge:
11125,BOOK XIV.,For never yet did such a flood of love
11126,BOOK XIV.,For Goddess or for mortal fill my soul;
11127,BOOK XIV.,"Not for Ixion’s beauteous wife, who bore"
11128,BOOK XIV.,"Pirithous, sage in council as the Gods;"
11129,BOOK XIV.,"Nor the neat-footed maiden Danae,"
11130,BOOK XIV.,"Acrisius’ daughter, her who Perseus bore,"
11131,BOOK XIV.,"Th’ observ’d of all; nor noble Phoenix’ child,"
11132,BOOK XIV.,"Who bore me Minos, and the godlike might"
11133,BOOK XIV.,"Of Rhadamanthus; nor for Semele,"
11134,BOOK XIV.,"Nor for Alcmena fair, of whom was born"
11135,BOOK XIV.,"In Thebes the mighty warrior Hercules,"
11136,BOOK XIV.,"As Bacchus, joy of men, of Semele:"
11137,BOOK XIV.,"No, nor for Ceres, golden-tressed Queen,"
11138,BOOK XIV.,"Nor for Latona bright, nor for thyself,"
11139,BOOK XIV.,As now with fond desire for thee I burn.”
11140,BOOK XIV.,
11141,BOOK XIV.,To whom thus Juno with deceitful speech:
11142,BOOK XIV.,"“What words, dread son of Saturn, dost thou speak?"
11143,BOOK XIV.,"If here on Ida, in the face of day,"
11144,BOOK XIV.,We celebrate the mystic rites of love.
11145,BOOK XIV.,How if some other of th’ immortal Gods
11146,BOOK XIV.,"Should find us sleeping, and ’mid all the Gods"
11147,BOOK XIV.,Should spread the tale abroad? I could not then
11148,BOOK XIV.,"Straight to thy house, for very shame, return."
11149,BOOK XIV.,"But if indeed such passion fill thy soul,"
11150,BOOK XIV.,"Thou hast thy secret chamber, built for thee"
11151,BOOK XIV.,"By Vulcan, with close-fitting doors secur’d;"
11152,BOOK XIV.,"Thither, if such thy pleasure, go we now.”"
11153,BOOK XIV.,
11154,BOOK XIV.,To whom the Cloud-compeller thus replied:
11155,BOOK XIV.,"“Juno, nor fear the eye of God or man;"
11156,BOOK XIV.,For all around us I will throw such veil
11157,BOOK XIV.,"Of golden cloud, that not the sun himself"
11158,BOOK XIV.,With sharpest beam of light may pierce it through.”
11159,BOOK XIV.,
11160,BOOK XIV.,"Thus saying, in his arms he clasp’d his wife;"
11161,BOOK XIV.,The teeming earth beneath them caus’d to spring
11162,BOOK XIV.,"The tender grass, and lotus dew-besprent,"
11163,BOOK XIV.,"Crocus and hyacinth, a fragrant couch,"
11164,BOOK XIV.,"Profuse and soft, upspringing from the earth."
11165,BOOK XIV.,"There lay they, all around them spread a veil"
11166,BOOK XIV.,"Of golden cloud, whence heav’nly dews distill’d."
11167,BOOK XIV.,"There on the topmost height of Gargarus,"
11168,BOOK XIV.,"By sleep and love subdued, th’ immortal Sire,"
11169,BOOK XIV.,"Clasp’d in his arms his wife, repos’d in peace."
11170,BOOK XIV.,
11171,BOOK XIV.,"Then Sleep arose, and to the Grecian ships"
11172,BOOK XIV.,"In haste repairing, to th’ Earth-shaking King"
11173,BOOK XIV.,His tidings bore; and standing at his side
11174,BOOK XIV.,Thus to the God his winged words address’d:
11175,BOOK XIV.,
11176,BOOK XIV.,"“Now, Neptune, to the Greeks thy ready aid"
11177,BOOK XIV.,"Afford, that short-liv’d triumph they may gain,"
11178,BOOK XIV.,While slumber holds the eyes of Jove; for I
11179,BOOK XIV.,"In sweet unconsciousness have drown’d his sense,"
11180,BOOK XIV.,"Beguil’d by Juno, in whose arms he lies.”"
11181,BOOK XIV.,
11182,BOOK XIV.,"He said, and vanish’d ’mid the tribes of men:"
11183,BOOK XIV.,"But fir’d with keener zeal to aid the Greeks,"
11184,BOOK XIV.,"Neptune sprang forth in front, and call’d aloud:"
11185,BOOK XIV.,
11186,BOOK XIV.,"“Again, ye Greeks, shall our remissness yield"
11187,BOOK XIV.,"The victory to Hector, Priam’s son,"
11188,BOOK XIV.,"To seize our ships, and endless glory gain?"
11189,BOOK XIV.,"Such is his boast and menace, since in wrath"
11190,BOOK XIV.,Achilles still beside his ships remains.
11191,BOOK XIV.,"Yet him we scarce should miss, if we, the rest,"
11192,BOOK XIV.,But firmly stood for mutual defence.
11193,BOOK XIV.,"Hear then my counsel: let us all agree,"
11194,BOOK XIV.,"Girt with our best and broadest shields, our heads"
11195,BOOK XIV.,"With flashing helmets guarded, in our hands"
11196,BOOK XIV.,"Grasping our longest spears, to dare the fight."
11197,BOOK XIV.,"Myself will lead you on; and Priam’s son,"
11198,BOOK XIV.,"Though bold he be, will fear with me to cope."
11199,BOOK XIV.,"And if, among our bravest, any bear"
11200,BOOK XIV.,"Too small a buckler, with some meaner man"
11201,BOOK XIV.,"Let him exchange, and don the larger shield.”"
11202,BOOK XIV.,
11203,BOOK XIV.,"He said, and they assenting heard his speech."
11204,BOOK XIV.,"The Kings themselves, Ulysses, Diomed,"
11205,BOOK XIV.,"And mighty Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,"
11206,BOOK XIV.,"Though sorely wounded, yet the troops array’d;"
11207,BOOK XIV.,"Thro’out the ranks they pass’d, and chang’d the arms;"
11208,BOOK XIV.,"The bravest donn’d the best, the worse the worst."
11209,BOOK XIV.,"When with their dazzling armour all were girt,"
11210,BOOK XIV.,Forward they mov’d; th’ Earth-shaker led them on:
11211,BOOK XIV.,"In his broad hand an awful sword he bore,"
11212,BOOK XIV.,"Long-bladed, vivid as the lightning’s flash:"
11213,BOOK XIV.,"Yet in the deadly strife he might not join,"
11214,BOOK XIV.,But kindled terror in the minds of men.
11215,BOOK XIV.,
11216,BOOK XIV.,Hector meantime the Trojan troops array’d.
11217,BOOK XIV.,"Then fiercer grew, and more intense the strain"
11218,BOOK XIV.,"Of furious fight, when Ocean’s dark-hair’d King"
11219,BOOK XIV.,"And Priam’s noble son were met in arms,"
11220,BOOK XIV.,"And aided, this the Trojans, that the Greeks."
11221,BOOK XIV.,"High tow’rd the tents uprose the surging sea,"
11222,BOOK XIV.,As with loud clamour met th’ opposing hosts.
11223,BOOK XIV.,"Less loud the roar of Ocean’s wave, that driv’n"
11224,BOOK XIV.,"By stormy Boreas, breaks upon the beach;"
11225,BOOK XIV.,Less loud the crackling of the flames that rage
11226,BOOK XIV.,In the deep forest of some mountain glen;
11227,BOOK XIV.,"Less loud the wind, to wildest fury rous’d,"
11228,BOOK XIV.,Howls in the branches of the lofty oaks;
11229,BOOK XIV.,"Than rose the cry of Trojans and of Greeks,"
11230,BOOK XIV.,"As each, with furious shout, encounter’d each."
11231,BOOK XIV.,"At Ajax first, who straight before him stood,"
11232,BOOK XIV.,"Great Hector threw his spear, nor miss’d his aim,"
11233,BOOK XIV.,"Where the two belts, the one which bore his shield,"
11234,BOOK XIV.,"His silver-studded sword the other, met"
11235,BOOK XIV.,Across his breast; these two his life preserv’d.
11236,BOOK XIV.,"Hector was wroth, that from his stalwart hand"
11237,BOOK XIV.,The spear had flown in vain; and back he sprang
11238,BOOK XIV.,For safety to his comrades’ shelt’ring ranks:
11239,BOOK XIV.,But mighty Ajax Telamon upheav’d
11240,BOOK XIV.,"A pond’rous stone, of many, all around"
11241,BOOK XIV.,"That scatter’d lay beneath the warriors’ feet,"
11242,BOOK XIV.,"And serv’d to prop the ships; with one of these,"
11243,BOOK XIV.,"As Hector backward stepp’d, above the shield"
11244,BOOK XIV.,"He smote him on the breast, below the throat."
11245,BOOK XIV.,"With whirling motion, circling as it flew,"
11246,BOOK XIV.,The mass he hurl’d. As by the bolt of Heav’n
11247,BOOK XIV.,"Uprooted, prostrate lies some forest oak;"
11248,BOOK XIV.,"The sulph’rous vapour taints the air; appall’d,"
11249,BOOK XIV.,"Bereft of strength, the near beholder stands,"
11250,BOOK XIV.,And awestruck hears the thunder-peal of Jove;
11251,BOOK XIV.,So in the dust the might of Hector lay:
11252,BOOK XIV.,Dropp’d from his hand the spear; the shield and helm
11253,BOOK XIV.,Fell with him; loud his polished armour rang.
11254,BOOK XIV.,"On rush’d, with joyous shout, the sons of Greece,"
11255,BOOK XIV.,In hope to seize the spoil; thick flew the spears:
11256,BOOK XIV.,Yet none might reach or wound the fallen chief;
11257,BOOK XIV.,"For gather’d close around, the bravest all,"
11258,BOOK XIV.,"Valiant Æneas, and Polydamas,"
11259,BOOK XIV.,"Godlike Agenor, and the Lycian chief"
11260,BOOK XIV.,"Sarpedon, and the noble Glaucus stood."
11261,BOOK XIV.,Nor did the rest not aid; their shields’ broad orbs
11262,BOOK XIV.,"Before him still they held, while in their arms"
11263,BOOK XIV.,"His comrades bore him from the battle-field,"
11264,BOOK XIV.,"To where, with charioteer and well-wrought car,"
11265,BOOK XIV.,"Beyond the fight, his flying coursers stood,"
11266,BOOK XIV.,"Which bore him, deeply groaning, tow’rd the town."
11267,BOOK XIV.,"But when the ford was reach’d of Xanthus’ stream,"
11268,BOOK XIV.,"Broad-flowing, eddying, by immortal Jove"
11269,BOOK XIV.,"Begotten, on the ground they laid him down,"
11270,BOOK XIV.,And dash’d the cooling water on his brow:
11271,BOOK XIV.,"Reviv’d, he lifted up awhile his eyes;"
11272,BOOK XIV.,"Then on his knees half rising, he disgorg’d"
11273,BOOK XIV.,"The clotted blood; but backward to the earth,"
11274,BOOK XIV.,"Still by the blow subdu’d, again he fell,"
11275,BOOK XIV.,And darkling shades of night his eyes o’erspread.
11276,BOOK XIV.,
11277,BOOK XIV.,"Onward, with zeal redoubled, press’d the Greeks,"
11278,BOOK XIV.,When Hector from the field they saw withdrawn.
11279,BOOK XIV.,"Foremost of all, Oileus’ active son,"
11280,BOOK XIV.,"With sudden spring assailing, Satnius slew:"
11281,BOOK XIV.,"Him a fair Naiad nymph to Œnops bore,"
11282,BOOK XIV.,Who by the banks of Satnois kept his herds.
11283,BOOK XIV.,"Him then, approaching near, Oileus’ son"
11284,BOOK XIV.,"Thrust through the flank: he fell, and o’er his corpse"
11285,BOOK XIV.,Trojans and Greeks in stubborn fight engag’d.
11286,BOOK XIV.,"But Panthous’ son a swift avenger came,"
11287,BOOK XIV.,"Polydamas, with brandish’d spear, and struck"
11288,BOOK XIV.,"Through the right shoulder Prothoenor, son"
11289,BOOK XIV.,Of Areilycus; right through was driv’n
11290,BOOK XIV.,"The sturdy spear; he, rolling in the dust,"
11291,BOOK XIV.,"Clutch’d with his palms the ground; then, shouting loud,"
11292,BOOK XIV.,Thus with triumphant boast Polydamas:
11293,BOOK XIV.,
11294,BOOK XIV.,“From the strong hand of Panthous’ noble son
11295,BOOK XIV.,Methinks that not in vain the spear has flown:
11296,BOOK XIV.,"A Greek now bears it off; and he, perchance,"
11297,BOOK XIV.,May use it as a staff to Pluto’s realm.”
11298,BOOK XIV.,
11299,BOOK XIV.,Thus he; the Greeks with pain his vaunting heard;
11300,BOOK XIV.,But chief it rous’d the spirit within the breast
11301,BOOK XIV.,"Of Ajax Telamon, whom close beside"
11302,BOOK XIV.,"The dead had fall’n; he at Polydamas,"
11303,BOOK XIV.,"Retreating, hurl’d in haste his glitt’ring spear;"
11304,BOOK XIV.,"He, springing sideways, ’scap’d the stroke of fate;"
11305,BOOK XIV.,"But young Archilochus, Antenor’s son,"
11306,BOOK XIV.,"Receiv’d the spear, for Heav’n had will’d his death:"
11307,BOOK XIV.,"The spine it struck, the topmost joint, where met"
11308,BOOK XIV.,"The head and neck, and both the tendons broke;"
11309,BOOK XIV.,"Forward he fell; and ere or knee or leg,"
11310,BOOK XIV.,"His head, and mouth, and nostrils struck the ground."
11311,BOOK XIV.,
11312,BOOK XIV.,"Then Ajax, in his turn, exulting, thus:"
11313,BOOK XIV.,"“Say now, Polydamas, and tell me true,"
11314,BOOK XIV.,May this be deem’d for Prothoenor’s death
11315,BOOK XIV.,A full equivalent? no common man
11316,BOOK XIV.,"He seems, and born of no ignoble race;"
11317,BOOK XIV.,"Valiant Antenor’s brother, or perchance"
11318,BOOK XIV.,His son; the likeness speaks him near akin.”
11319,BOOK XIV.,
11320,BOOK XIV.,"Thus he, though well he knew; then bitter grief"
11321,BOOK XIV.,"Possess’d the Trojans’ souls; but Acamas,"
11322,BOOK XIV.,"Guarding his brother’s body, with his spear"
11323,BOOK XIV.,"Slew the Bœotian Promachus, who fain"
11324,BOOK XIV.,Would by the feet have drawn away the dead:
11325,BOOK XIV.,"Then Acamas, exulting, cried aloud:"
11326,BOOK XIV.,
11327,BOOK XIV.,"“Ye wretched Greeks, in boasting measureless!"
11328,BOOK XIV.,Not ours alone the labour and the loss
11329,BOOK XIV.,Of battle; ye too have your share of death.
11330,BOOK XIV.,"Behold where lies your Promachus, subdued"
11331,BOOK XIV.,Beneath my spear; not long unpaid the debt
11332,BOOK XIV.,Due for my brother’s blood! ’Tis well for him
11333,BOOK XIV.,Who leaves a brother to avenge his fate.”
11334,BOOK XIV.,
11335,BOOK XIV.,Thus he; the Greeks with pain his vaunting heard;
11336,BOOK XIV.,But chief it rous’d the spirit within the breast
11337,BOOK XIV.,"Of Peneleus; on Acamas he sprang,"
11338,BOOK XIV.,Who waited not th’ encounter; next he slew
11339,BOOK XIV.,"Ilioneus, the son of Phorbas, Lord"
11340,BOOK XIV.,"Of num’rous flocks, of all the Trojans most"
11341,BOOK XIV.,"Belov’d of Hermes, who his wealth increas’d."
11342,BOOK XIV.,"To him Ilioneus, an only son,"
11343,BOOK XIV.,"His mother bore; who now, beneath the brow"
11344,BOOK XIV.,"And through the socket of the eye was struck,"
11345,BOOK XIV.,"Thrusting the eyeball out; for through the eye,"
11346,BOOK XIV.,"And backward through the head, the spear was driv’n:"
11347,BOOK XIV.,"With hands extended, down to earth he sank;"
11348,BOOK XIV.,But Peneleus his weighty sword let fall
11349,BOOK XIV.,Full on his neck; the sever’d head and helm
11350,BOOK XIV.,"Together fell, remaining still infix’d"
11351,BOOK XIV.,"The sturdy spear; then he, the gory head"
11352,BOOK XIV.,"Uplifting, to the Trojans vaunting cried:"
11353,BOOK XIV.,
11354,BOOK XIV.,"“Go now, ye Trojans! bid that in the house"
11355,BOOK XIV.,Of brave Ilioneus his parents raise
11356,BOOK XIV.,The voice of wailing for their gallant son;
11357,BOOK XIV.,"As neither shall the wife of Promachus,"
11358,BOOK XIV.,"The son of Alegenor, with glad smile"
11359,BOOK XIV.,"Her husband’s coming hail, when home from Troy"
11360,BOOK XIV.,"We sons of Greece, with vict’ry crown’d, return.”"
11361,BOOK XIV.,
11362,BOOK XIV.,"Thus as he spoke, pale fear possess’d them all,"
11363,BOOK XIV.,Each looking round to seek escape from death.
11364,BOOK XIV.,
11365,BOOK XIV.,"Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell,"
11366,BOOK XIV.,"Who, when th’ Earth-shaker turn’d the tide of war,"
11367,BOOK XIV.,First bore away his foeman’s bloody spoils?
11368,BOOK XIV.,
11369,BOOK XIV.,"Great Ajax Telamon first Hyrtius smote,"
11370,BOOK XIV.,"The son of Gyrtius, who to battle led"
11371,BOOK XIV.,The warlike Mysians; next Antilochus
11372,BOOK XIV.,From Mermerus and Phalces stripp’d their arms;
11373,BOOK XIV.,"Meriones Hippotion gave to death,"
11374,BOOK XIV.,"And Morys; Teucer Periphetes slew,"
11375,BOOK XIV.,"And Prothoon; Menelaus, through the flank"
11376,BOOK XIV.,Smote Hyperenor; as the grinding spear
11377,BOOK XIV.,"Drain’d all his vitals, through the gaping wound"
11378,BOOK XIV.,"His spirit escap’d, and darkness clos’d his eyes."
11379,BOOK XIV.,But chiefest slaughter of the Trojans wrought
11380,BOOK XIV.,Oileus’ active son; of all the Greeks
11381,BOOK XIV.,"No foot so swift as his, when Jove had fill’d"
11382,BOOK XIV.,"Their souls with fear, to chase the flying foe."

11410,BOOK XV.,"Many had fall’n by Grecian swords, the rest,"

11414,BOOK XV.,"Rising, he saw the Trojans and the Greeks,"
11415,BOOK XV.,"Those in confusion, while behind them press’d"
11416,BOOK XV.,"The Greeks, triumphant, Neptune in their midst:"

11419,BOOK XV.,"Drawing short breath, blood gushing from his mouth;"

11421,BOOK XV.,
11422,BOOK XV.,"Pitying, the Sire of Gods and men beheld,"

11426,BOOK XV.,"Nor know I but thyself mayst reap the fruit,"
11427,BOOK XV.,"By shameful scourging, of thy vile deceit."
11428,BOOK XV.,Hast thou forgotten how in former times
11429,BOOK XV.,"I hung thee from on high, and to thy feet"
11430,BOOK XV.,"Attach’d two pond’rous anvils, and thy hands"
11431,BOOK XV.,"With golden fetters bound, which none might break?"
11432,BOOK XV.,There didst thou hang amid the clouds of Heav’n;
11433,BOOK XV.,Through all Olympus’ breadth the Gods were wroth;
11434,BOOK XV.,Yet dar’d not one approach to set thee free.
11435,BOOK XV.,"If any so had ventur’d, him had I"
11436,BOOK XV.,"Hurl’d from Heav’n’s threshold till to earth he fell,"
11437,BOOK XV.,With little left of life. Yet was not quench’d
11438,BOOK XV.,"My wrath on godlike Hercules’ account,"
11439,BOOK XV.,"Whom thou, with Boreas, o’er the wat’ry waste"

11452,BOOK XV.,"“By Earth I swear, and yon broad Heav’n above,"

11473,BOOK XV.,"And if in all sincerity thou speak,"
11474,BOOK XV.,"Go to th’ assembled Gods, and hither send"
11475,BOOK XV.,"Iris, and Phoebus of the silver bow;"
11476,BOOK XV.,"That she may to the Grecian camp repair,"
11477,BOOK XV.,And bid that Neptune from the battle-field
11478,BOOK XV.,"Withdraw, and to his own domain retire;"
11479,BOOK XV.,"While Phoebus Hector to the fight restores,"
11480,BOOK XV.,"Inspiring new-born vigour, and allaying"
11481,BOOK XV.,The mortal pains which bow his spirit down:
11482,BOOK XV.,"Then, heartless fear infusing in the Greeks,"
11483,BOOK XV.,"Put them to flight, that flying they may fall"
11484,BOOK XV.,"Beside Achilles’ ships; his comrade then,"
11485,BOOK XV.,"Patroclus, he shall send to battle forth"
11486,BOOK XV.,"To be by Hector slain, in front of Troy;"
11487,BOOK XV.,Yet not to fall till many valiant youths
11488,BOOK XV.,"Have felt his prowess; and, amid the rest,"
11489,BOOK XV.,"My son, Sarpedon; by his comrade’s death"
11490,BOOK XV.,"Enrag’d, Achilles Hector shall subdue;"
11491,BOOK XV.,"Thenceforth my counsel is, that from the ships"
11492,BOOK XV.,"The Trojan force shall still be backward driv’n,"
11493,BOOK XV.,"Until at length, by Pallas’ deep designs,"
11494,BOOK XV.,The Greeks possess the lofty walls of Troy.
11495,BOOK XV.,"Yet will not I my anger intermit,"
11496,BOOK XV.,Nor suffer other of th’ immortal Gods
11497,BOOK XV.,"To aid the Greeks, till Peleus’ son behold"
11498,BOOK XV.,"His wish accomplish’d, and the boon obtain’d"
11499,BOOK XV.,"I promis’d once, and with a nod confirm’d,"
11500,BOOK XV.,"That day when sea-born Thetis clasp’d my knees,"
11501,BOOK XV.,And pray’d me to avenge her warrior son.”
11502,BOOK XV.,
11503,BOOK XV.,Thus he; the white-arm’d Queen of Heav’n submiss
11504,BOOK XV.,His mandate heard; and from th’ Idaean mount
11505,BOOK XV.,With rapid flight to high Olympus sped.
11506,BOOK XV.,"Swift as the mind of man, who many a land"
11507,BOOK XV.,"Hath travell’d o’er, and with reflective thought"
11508,BOOK XV.,"Recalls, “here was I such a day, or here,”"
11509,BOOK XV.,And in a moment many a scene surveys;
11510,BOOK XV.,So Juno sped o’er intervening space;
11511,BOOK XV.,"Olympus’ heights she reach’d, and in the house"
11512,BOOK XV.,Of Jove appear’d amid th’ assembled Gods.
11513,BOOK XV.,"They at her coming rose, with golden cups"
11514,BOOK XV.,"Greeting their Queen’s approach; the rest she pass’d,"
11515,BOOK XV.,And from the hand of fair-fac’d Themis took
11516,BOOK XV.,"The proffer’d cup, who first had run to meet,"
11517,BOOK XV.,And thus with winged words address’d the Queen:
11518,BOOK XV.,"“Juno, why com’st thou hither? and with looks"
11519,BOOK XV.,"Of one distraught with, fear? hath Saturn’s son,"
11520,BOOK XV.,"Thy mighty Lord, thus sore affrighted thee?”"
11521,BOOK XV.,"To whom the white-arm’d Goddess, Juno, thus:"
11522,BOOK XV.,
11523,BOOK XV.,"“Forbear thy questions, Themis; well thou know’st"
11524,BOOK XV.,How haughty and imperious is his mind;
11525,BOOK XV.,Thou for the Gods in haste prepare the feast;
11526,BOOK XV.,"Then shalt thou learn, amid th’ Immortals all,"
11527,BOOK XV.,"What evil he designs; nor all, I ween,"
11528,BOOK XV.,"His counsels will approve, or men, or Gods,"
11529,BOOK XV.,Though now in blissful ignorance they feast.”
11530,BOOK XV.,
11531,BOOK XV.,"She said, and sat; the Gods, oppress’d with care,"
11532,BOOK XV.,Her farther speech awaited; on her lips
11533,BOOK XV.,"There dwelt indeed a smile, but not a ray"
11534,BOOK XV.,"Pass’d o’er her dark’ning brow, as thus her wrath"
11535,BOOK XV.,Amid th’ assembled Gods found vent in words:
11536,BOOK XV.,
11537,BOOK XV.,"“Fools are we all, who madly strive with Jove,"
11538,BOOK XV.,"Or hope, by access to his throne, to sway,"
11539,BOOK XV.,"By word or deed, his course; from all apart,"
11540,BOOK XV.,"He all our counsels heeds not, but derides;"
11541,BOOK XV.,And boasts o’er all th’ immortal Gods to reign
11542,BOOK XV.,In unapproach’d pre-eminence of pow’r.
11543,BOOK XV.,Prepare then each his sev’ral woe to bear;
11544,BOOK XV.,"On Mars e’en now, methinks, the blow hath fall’n;"
11545,BOOK XV.,"Since in the fight, the man he loves the best,"
11546,BOOK XV.,"And boasts his son, Ascalaphus, is slain.”"
11547,BOOK XV.,"She said; and Mars, enrag’d, his brawny thigh"
11548,BOOK XV.,"Smote with his hands, and thus, lamenting, spoke:"
11549,BOOK XV.,
11550,BOOK XV.,"“Blame not, ye Gods, who on Olympus dwell,"
11551,BOOK XV.,"That to the Grecian ships I haste, to avenge"
11552,BOOK XV.,"My slaughter’d son, though blasted by Heav’n’s fire"
11553,BOOK XV.,"’Twere mine ’mid corpses, blood, and dust to lie.”"
11554,BOOK XV.,
11555,BOOK XV.,"He said, and gave command to Fear and Flight"
11556,BOOK XV.,To yoke his car; and donn’d his glitt’ring arms.
11557,BOOK XV.,Then from the throne of Jove had heavier wrath
11558,BOOK XV.,"And deeper vengeance on th’ Immortals fall’n,"
11559,BOOK XV.,"But Pallas, in alarm for all the Gods,"
11560,BOOK XV.,"Quitting in haste the throne whereon she sat,"
11561,BOOK XV.,"Sprang past the vestibule, and from his head"
11562,BOOK XV.,"The helmet lifted, from his arm the shield;"
11563,BOOK XV.,"Took from his sturdy hand, and rear’d upright,"
11564,BOOK XV.,The brazen spear; then with reproachful words
11565,BOOK XV.,She thus assail’d th’ impetuous God of War;
11566,BOOK XV.,
11567,BOOK XV.,"“Frantic, and passion-maddened, thou art lost!"
11568,BOOK XV.,Hast thou no ears to hear! or are thy mind
11569,BOOK XV.,And sense of rev’rence utterly destroyed?
11570,BOOK XV.,"Or heard’st thou not what white-arm’d Juno spoke,"
11571,BOOK XV.,Fresh from the presence of Olympian Jove?
11572,BOOK XV.,"Wouldst thou, thine evil destiny fulfill’d,"
11573,BOOK XV.,"By hard constraint, despite thy grief, be driv’n"
11574,BOOK XV.,Back to Olympus; and to all the rest
11575,BOOK XV.,Confusion and disaster with thee bring?
11576,BOOK XV.,At once from valiant Trojans and from Greeks
11577,BOOK XV.,"His thoughts would be diverted, and his wrath"
11578,BOOK XV.,"Embroil Olympus, and on all alike,"
11579,BOOK XV.,"Guilty or not, his anger would be pour’d."
11580,BOOK XV.,Waive then thy vengeance for thy gallant son;
11581,BOOK XV.,"Others as brave of heart, as strong of arm,"
11582,BOOK XV.,"Have fall’n, and yet must fall; and vain th’ attempt"
11583,BOOK XV.,To watch at once o’er all the race of men.”
11584,BOOK XV.,
11585,BOOK XV.,"Thus saying, to his seat again she forc’d"
11586,BOOK XV.,"Th’ impetuous Mars: meanwhile, without the house,"
11587,BOOK XV.,"Juno, by Jove’s command, Apollo call’d,"
11588,BOOK XV.,"And Iris, messenger from God to God;"
11589,BOOK XV.,And thus to both her winged words address’d:
11590,BOOK XV.,
11591,BOOK XV.,“Jove bids you with all speed to Ida haste;
11592,BOOK XV.,"And when, arriv’d, before his face ye stand,"
11593,BOOK XV.,"Whate’er he orders, that observe and do.”"
11594,BOOK XV.,
11595,BOOK XV.,"Thus Juno spoke, and to her throne return’d;"
11596,BOOK XV.,"While they to spring-abounding Ida’s heights,"
11597,BOOK XV.,"Wild nurse of forest beasts, pursued their way;"
11598,BOOK XV.,Th’ all-seeing son of Saturn there they found
11599,BOOK XV.,"Upon the topmost crag of Gargarus,"
11600,BOOK XV.,An incense-breathing cloud around him spread.
11601,BOOK XV.,Before the face of cloud-compelling Jove
11602,BOOK XV.,They stood; well-pleas’d he witness’d their approach
11603,BOOK XV.,"In swift obedience to his consort’s words,"
11604,BOOK XV.,And thus to Iris first his speech address’d:
11605,BOOK XV.,
11606,BOOK XV.,"“Haste thee, swift Iris, and to Ocean’s King"
11607,BOOK XV.,"My message bear, nor misreporting aught,"
11608,BOOK XV.,Nor aught omitting; from the battle-field
11609,BOOK XV.,"Bid him retire, and join th’ assembled Gods,"
11610,BOOK XV.,Or to his own domain of sea withdraw.
11611,BOOK XV.,"If my commands he heed not, nor obey,"
11612,BOOK XV.,Let him consider in his inmost soul
11613,BOOK XV.,"If, mighty though he be, he dare await"
11614,BOOK XV.,"My hostile coming; mightier far than him,"
11615,BOOK XV.,His elder born; nor may his spirit aspire
11616,BOOK XV.,"To rival me, whom all regard with awe.”"
11617,BOOK XV.,
11618,BOOK XV.,"He said; swift-footed Iris, at the word,"
11619,BOOK XV.,From Ida’s heights to sacred Ilium sped.
11620,BOOK XV.,"Swift as the snow-flakes from the clouds descend,"
11621,BOOK XV.,Or wintry hail before the driving blast
11622,BOOK XV.,"Of Boreas, ether-born; so swift to Earth"
11623,BOOK XV.,"Descended Iris; by his side she stood,"
11624,BOOK XV.,And with these words th’ Earth-shaking God address’d:
11625,BOOK XV.,"“A message, dark-hair’d Circler of the Earth,"
11626,BOOK XV.,To thee I bring from Ægis-bearing Jove.
11627,BOOK XV.,He bids thee straightway from the battle-field
11628,BOOK XV.,"Retire, and either join th’ assembled Gods,"
11629,BOOK XV.,Or to thine own domain of sea withdraw.
11630,BOOK XV.,"If his commands thou heed not, nor obey,"
11631,BOOK XV.,"Hither he menaces himself to come,"
11632,BOOK XV.,"And fight against thee; but he warns thee first,"
11633,BOOK XV.,"Beware his arm, as mightier far than thee,"
11634,BOOK XV.,Thine elder born; nor may thy spirit aspire
11635,BOOK XV.,"To rival him, whom all regard with awe.”"
11636,BOOK XV.,
11637,BOOK XV.,To whom in tow’ring wrath th’ Earth-shaking God:
11638,BOOK XV.,"“By Heav’n, though great he be, he yet presumes"
11639,BOOK XV.,"Somewhat too far, if me, his equal born,"
11640,BOOK XV.,He seeks by force to baffle of my will.
11641,BOOK XV.,"We were three brethren, all of Rhaea born"
11642,BOOK XV.,"To Saturn; Jove and I, and Pluto third,"
11643,BOOK XV.,Who o’er the nether regions holds his sway.
11644,BOOK XV.,Threefold was our partition; each obtain’d
11645,BOOK XV.,His meed of honour due; the hoary Sea
11646,BOOK XV.,By lot my habitation was assign’d;
11647,BOOK XV.,The realms of Darkness fell to Pluto’s share;
11648,BOOK XV.,"Broad Heav’n, amid the sky and clouds, to Jove;"
11649,BOOK XV.,"But Earth, and high Olympus, are to all"
11650,BOOK XV.,A common heritage; nor will I walk
11651,BOOK XV.,"To please the will of Jove; though great he be,"
11652,BOOK XV.,With his own third contented let him rest:
11653,BOOK XV.,"Nor let him think that I, as wholly vile,"
11654,BOOK XV.,Shall quail before his arm; his lofty words
11655,BOOK XV.,Were better to his daughters and his sons
11656,BOOK XV.,"Address’d, his own begotten; who perforce"
11657,BOOK XV.,"Must listen to his mandates, and obey.”"
11658,BOOK XV.,
11659,BOOK XV.,To whom swift-footed Iris thus replied:
11660,BOOK XV.,"“Is this, then, dark-hair’d Circler of the Earth,"
11661,BOOK XV.,"The message, stern and haughty, which to Jove"
11662,BOOK XV.,Thou bidd’st me bear? perchance thine angry mood
11663,BOOK XV.,May bend to better counsels; noblest minds
11664,BOOK XV.,Are easiest bent; and o’er superior age
11665,BOOK XV.,Thou know’st th’ avenging Furies ever watch.”
11666,BOOK XV.,
11667,BOOK XV.,To whom Earth-shaking Neptune thus replied:
11668,BOOK XV.,"“Immortal Iris, weighty are thy words,"
11669,BOOK XV.,And in good season spoken; and ’tis well
11670,BOOK XV.,When envoys are by sound discretion led.
11671,BOOK XV.,"Yet are my heart and mind with grief oppress’d,"
11672,BOOK XV.,"When me, his equal both by birth and fate,"
11673,BOOK XV.,He seeks with haughty words to overbear.
11674,BOOK XV.,"I yield, but with indignant sense of wrong."
11675,BOOK XV.,"This too I say, nor shall my threat be vain:"
11676,BOOK XV.,"Let him remember, if in my despite,"
11677,BOOK XV.,"’Gainst Pallas’, Juno’s, Hermes’, Vulcan’s will,"
11678,BOOK XV.,"He spare to overthrow proud Ilium’s tow’rs,"
11679,BOOK XV.,"And crown with victory the Grecian arms,"
11680,BOOK XV.,The feud between us never can be heal’d.”
11681,BOOK XV.,
11682,BOOK XV.,"Th’ Earth-shaker said, and from the field withdrew"
11683,BOOK XV.,"Beneath the ocean wave, the warrior Greeks"
11684,BOOK XV.,His loss deploring; to Apollo then
11685,BOOK XV.,The Cloud-compeller thus his speech address’d:
11686,BOOK XV.,
11687,BOOK XV.,"“Go straight to Hector of the brazen helm,"
11688,BOOK XV.,Good Phoebus; for beneath the ocean wave
11689,BOOK XV.,"Th’ Earth-shaker hath withdrawn, escaping thus"
11690,BOOK XV.,"My high displeasure; had he dar’d resist,"
11691,BOOK XV.,The tumult of our strife had reach’d the Gods
11692,BOOK XV.,Who in the nether realms with Saturn dwell.
11693,BOOK XV.,"Yet thus ’tis better, both for me and him,"
11694,BOOK XV.,"That, though indignant, to my will he yields;"
11695,BOOK XV.,For to compel him were no easy task.
11696,BOOK XV.,"Take thou, and wave on high thy tassell’d shield,"
11697,BOOK XV.,"The Grecian warriors daunting: thou thyself,"
11698,BOOK XV.,"Far-darting King, thy special care bestow"
11699,BOOK XV.,On noble Hector; so restore his strength
11700,BOOK XV.,"And vigour, that in panic to their ships,"
11701,BOOK XV.,"And the broad Hellespont, the Greeks be driv’n."
11702,BOOK XV.,Then will I so by word and deed contrive
11703,BOOK XV.,That they may gain fresh respite from their toil.”
11704,BOOK XV.,
11705,BOOK XV.,"He said, nor did Apollo not obey"
11706,BOOK XV.,"His Sire’s commands; from Ida’s heights he flew,"
11707,BOOK XV.,"Like to a falcon, swooping on a dove,"
11708,BOOK XV.,"Swiftest of birds; then Priam’s son he found,"
11709,BOOK XV.,"The godlike Hector, stretch’d at length no more,"
11710,BOOK XV.,"But sitting, now to consciousness restor’d,"
11711,BOOK XV.,With recognition looking on his friends;
11712,BOOK XV.,"The cold sweat dried, nor gasping now for breath,"
11713,BOOK XV.,Since by the will of Ægis-bearing Jove
11714,BOOK XV.,To life new waken’d; close beside him stood
11715,BOOK XV.,"The Far-destroyer, and address’d him thus:"
11716,BOOK XV.,"“Hector, thou son of Priam, why apart"
11717,BOOK XV.,"From all thy comrades art thou sitting here,"
11718,BOOK XV.,Feeble and faint? What trouble weighs thee down?”
11719,BOOK XV.,
11720,BOOK XV.,To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm
11721,BOOK XV.,"With falt’ring voice: “Who art thou, Prince of Gods,"
11722,BOOK XV.,Who thus enquirest of me? know’st thou not
11723,BOOK XV.,"How a huge stone, by mighty Ajax hurl’d,"
11724,BOOK XV.,As on his comrades by the Grecian ships
11725,BOOK XV.,"I dealt destruction, struck me on the breast,"
11726,BOOK XV.,"Dash’d to the earth, and all my vigour quell’d?"
11727,BOOK XV.,"I deem’d in sooth this day my soul, expir’d,"
11728,BOOK XV.,"Should see the dead, and Pluto’s shadowy realm.”"
11729,BOOK XV.,
11730,BOOK XV.,To whom again the far-destroying King:
11731,BOOK XV.,“Be of good cheer; from Saturn’s son I come
11732,BOOK XV.,From Ida’s height to be thy guide and guard;
11733,BOOK XV.,"Phoebus Apollo, of the golden sword,"
11734,BOOK XV.,"I, who of old have thy protector been,"
11735,BOOK XV.,Thee and thy city guarding. Rise then straight;
11736,BOOK XV.,Summon thy num’rous horsemen; bid them drive
11737,BOOK XV.,Their flying cars to assail the Grecian ships:
11738,BOOK XV.,I go before: and will thy horses’ way
11739,BOOK XV.,"Make plain and smooth, and daunt the warrior Greeks.”"
11740,BOOK XV.,
11741,BOOK XV.,His words fresh vigour in the chief infus’d.
11742,BOOK XV.,"As some proud steed, at well-fill’d manger fed,"
11743,BOOK XV.,"His halter broken, neighing, scours the plain,"
11744,BOOK XV.,And revels in the widely-flowing stream
11745,BOOK XV.,"To bathe his sides; then tossing high his head,"
11746,BOOK XV.,"While o’er his shoulders streams his ample mane,"
11747,BOOK XV.,"Light-borne on active limbs, in conscious pride,"
11748,BOOK XV.,To the wide pastures of the mares he flies;
11749,BOOK XV.,"So vig’rous, Hector plied his active limbs,"
11750,BOOK XV.,His horsemen summoning at Heav’n’s command.
11751,BOOK XV.,
11752,BOOK XV.,As when a rustic crowd of men and dogs
11753,BOOK XV.,"Have chas’d an antler’d stag, or mountain goat,"
11754,BOOK XV.,That ’mid the crags and thick o’ershadowing wood
11755,BOOK XV.,"Hath refuge found, and baffled their pursuit:"
11756,BOOK XV.,"If, by the tumult rous’d, a lion stand,"
11757,BOOK XV.,"With bristling mane, before them, back they turn,"
11758,BOOK XV.,"Check’d in their mid career; ev’n so the Greeks,"
11759,BOOK XV.,"Who late in eager throngs were pressing on,"
11760,BOOK XV.,"Thrusting with swords and double-pointed spears,"
11761,BOOK XV.,"When Hector moving through the ranks they saw,"
11762,BOOK XV.,"Recoil’d, and to their feet their courage fell."
11763,BOOK XV.,"To whom thus Thoas spoke, Andraemon’s son,"
11764,BOOK XV.,"Ætolia’s bravest warrior, skill’d to throw"
11765,BOOK XV.,"The jav’lin, dauntless in the stubborn fight;"
11766,BOOK XV.,"By few surpass’d in speech, when in debate"
11767,BOOK XV.,In full assembly Grecian youths contend.
11768,BOOK XV.,"He thus with prudent speech began, and said:"
11769,BOOK XV.,
11770,BOOK XV.,"“Great is the marvel which our eyes behold,"
11771,BOOK XV.,"That Hector see again to life restor’d,"
11772,BOOK XV.,Escap’d the death we hop’d him to have met
11773,BOOK XV.,Beneath the hands of Ajax Telamon.
11774,BOOK XV.,"Some God hath been his guard, and Hector sav’d,"
11775,BOOK XV.,Whose arm hath slack’d the knees of many a Greek:
11776,BOOK XV.,So will he now; for not without the aid
11777,BOOK XV.,"Of Jove, the Lord of thunder, doth he stand"
11778,BOOK XV.,"So boldly forth, so eager for the fight."
11779,BOOK XV.,"Hear, then, and all by my advice be rul’d:"
11780,BOOK XV.,Back to the ships dismiss the gen’ral crowd;
11781,BOOK XV.,"While of our army we, the foremost men,"
11782,BOOK XV.,"Stand fast, and meeting him with levell’d spears,"
11783,BOOK XV.,"Hold him in check; and he, though brave, may fear"
11784,BOOK XV.,To throw himself amid our serried ranks.”
11785,BOOK XV.,
11786,BOOK XV.,"He said: they heard, and all obey’d his words:"
11787,BOOK XV.,"The mighty Ajax, and Idomeneus"
11788,BOOK XV.,"The King, and Teucer, and Meriones,"
11789,BOOK XV.,"And Meges, bold as Mars, with all their best,"
11790,BOOK XV.,"Their stedfast battle rang’d, to wait th’ assault"
11791,BOOK XV.,"Of Hector and his Trojans; while behind,"
11792,BOOK XV.,Th’ unwarlike many to the ships retir’d.
11793,BOOK XV.,"The Trojan mass came on, by Hector led"
11794,BOOK XV.,"With haughty stride; before him Phoebus went,"
11795,BOOK XV.,His shoulders veil’d in cloud; his arm sustain’d
11796,BOOK XV.,"The awful Ægis, dread to look on, hung"
11797,BOOK XV.,With shaggy tassels round and dazzling bright;
11798,BOOK XV.,"Which Vulcan, skilful workman, gave to Jove,"
11799,BOOK XV.,To scatter terror ’mid the souls of men.
11800,BOOK XV.,"This on his arm, the Trojan troops he led."
11801,BOOK XV.,Firm stood the mass of Greeks; from either side
11802,BOOK XV.,Shrill clamours rose; and fast from many a string
11803,BOOK XV.,"The arrows flew, and many a jav’lin, hurl’d"
11804,BOOK XV.,By vig’rous arms; some buried in the flesh
11805,BOOK XV.,"Of stalwart youths, and many, ere they reach’d"
11806,BOOK XV.,"Their living mark, fell midway on the plain,"
11807,BOOK XV.,"Fix’d in the ground, in vain athirst for blood."
11808,BOOK XV.,"While Phoebus motionless his Ægis held,"
11809,BOOK XV.,"Thick flew the shafts, and fast the people fell"
11810,BOOK XV.,On either side; but when he turn’d its flash
11811,BOOK XV.,"Full in the faces of the astonish’d Greeks,"
11812,BOOK XV.,"And shouted loud, their spirits within them quail’d,"
11813,BOOK XV.,Their fiery courage borne in mind no more.
11814,BOOK XV.,"As when two beasts of prey, at dead of night."
11815,BOOK XV.,With sudden onset scatter wide a herd
11816,BOOK XV.,"Of oxen, or a num’rous flock of sheep,"
11817,BOOK XV.,Their keepers absent; so unnerv’d by fear
11818,BOOK XV.,"The Greeks dispers’d; such panic ’mid their ranks,"
11819,BOOK XV.,"That vict’ry so might crown the Trojan arms,"
11820,BOOK XV.,"Apollo sent; and as the masses broke,"
11821,BOOK XV.,Each Trojan slew his man; by Hector’s hand
11822,BOOK XV.,"Fell Stichius and Arcesilas; the one,"
11823,BOOK XV.,"The leader of Bœotia’s brass-clad host,"
11824,BOOK XV.,"The other, brave Menestheus’ trusted friend."
11825,BOOK XV.,"Æneas Medon slew, and Iasus;"
11826,BOOK XV.,"Medon, the great Oileus’ bastard son,"
11827,BOOK XV.,"Brother of Ajax; he in Phylace,"
11828,BOOK XV.,"Far from his native home, was driv’n to dwell;"
11829,BOOK XV.,"Since one to Eriopis near akin,"
11830,BOOK XV.,"His sire Oileus’ wife, his hand had slain:"
11831,BOOK XV.,"And Iasus, th’ Athenian chief, was deem’d"
11832,BOOK XV.,"The son of Sphelus, son of Bucolus."
11833,BOOK XV.,Polydamas amid the foremost ranks
11834,BOOK XV.,"Mecistes slew, Polites Echius,"
11835,BOOK XV.,Agenor Olonius; while from Paris’ hand
11836,BOOK XV.,"An arrow, ’mid the crowd of fugitives"
11837,BOOK XV.,"Shot from behind, beneath the shoulder struck"
11838,BOOK XV.,"Deiocus, and through his chest was driv’n:"
11839,BOOK XV.,"These while the Trojans of their arms despoil’d,"
11840,BOOK XV.,Through ditch and palisades promiscuous dash’d
11841,BOOK XV.,"The flying Greeks, and gain’d, hard-press’d, the wall;"
11842,BOOK XV.,While loudly Hector to the Trojans call’d
11843,BOOK XV.,"To assail the ships, and leave the bloody spoils:"
11844,BOOK XV.,"“Whom I elsewhere, and from the ships aloof"
11845,BOOK XV.,"Shall find, my hand shall doom him on the spot;"
11846,BOOK XV.,"For him no fun’ral pyre his kin shall light,"
11847,BOOK XV.,Or male or female; but before the wall
11848,BOOK XV.,Our city’s dogs his mangled flesh shall tear.”
11849,BOOK XV.,
11850,BOOK XV.,He said; and on his horses’ shoulder point
11851,BOOK XV.,"Let fall the lash, and loudly through the ranks"
11852,BOOK XV.,"Call’d on the Trojans; they, with answ’ring shout"
11853,BOOK XV.,"And noise unspeakable, urg’d on with him"
11854,BOOK XV.,"Their harness’d steeds; Apollo, in the van,"
11855,BOOK XV.,"Trod down with ease th’ embankment of the ditch,"
11856,BOOK XV.,And fill’d it in; and o’er it bridg’d a way
11857,BOOK XV.,"Level and wide, far as a jav’lin’s flight"
11858,BOOK XV.,Hurl’d by an arm that proves its utmost strength.
11859,BOOK XV.,O’er this their columns pass’d; Apollo bore
11860,BOOK XV.,"His Ægis o’er them, and cast down the wall;"
11861,BOOK XV.,"Easy, as when a child upon the beach,"
11862,BOOK XV.,"In wanton play, with hands and feet o’erthrows"
11863,BOOK XV.,"The mound of sand, which late in play he rais’d;"
11864,BOOK XV.,"So, Phoebus, thou, the Grecian toil and pains"
11865,BOOK XV.,"Confounding, sentest panic through their souls."
11866,BOOK XV.,"Thus hemm’d beside the ships they made their stand,"
11867,BOOK XV.,"While each exhorted each, and all, with hands"
11868,BOOK XV.,"Outstretch’d, to ev’ry God address’d their pray’r:"
11869,BOOK XV.,"And chief, Gerenian Nestor, prop of Greece,"
11870,BOOK XV.,With hands uplifted tow’rd the starry Heav’n:
11871,BOOK XV.,
11872,BOOK XV.,“O Father Jove! if any e’er to Thee
11873,BOOK XV.,On corn-clad plains of Argos burnt the fat
11874,BOOK XV.,"Of bulls and sheep, and offer’d up his pray’r"
11875,BOOK XV.,For safe return; and thine assenting nod
11876,BOOK XV.,Confirm’d thy promise; O remember now
11877,BOOK XV.,"His pray’r; stave off the pitiless day of doom,"
11878,BOOK XV.,Nor let the Greeks to Trojan arms succumb.”
11879,BOOK XV.,
11880,BOOK XV.,Thus Nestor pray’d; loud thunder’d from on high
11881,BOOK XV.,"The Lord of counsel, as he heard the pray’r"
11882,BOOK XV.,"Of Neleus’ aged son; with double zeal,"
11883,BOOK XV.,"The Trojans, as the mind of Jove they knew,"
11884,BOOK XV.,"Press’d on the Greeks, with warlike ardour fir’d."
11885,BOOK XV.,As o’er the bulwarks of a ship pour down
11886,BOOK XV.,"The mighty billows of the wide-path’d sea,"
11887,BOOK XV.,"Driv’n by the blast, that tosses high the waves,"
11888,BOOK XV.,"So down the wall, with shouts, the Trojans pour’d;"
11889,BOOK XV.,"The cars admitted, by the ships they fought"
11890,BOOK XV.,"With double-pointed spears, and hand to hand;"
11891,BOOK XV.,"These on their chariots, on the lofty decks"
11892,BOOK XV.,"Of their dark vessels those, with pond’rous spars"
11893,BOOK XV.,"Which on the ships were stor’d for naval war,"
11894,BOOK XV.,"Compact and strong, their heads encas’d in brass."
11895,BOOK XV.,
11896,BOOK XV.,"While yet beyond the ships, about the wall"
11897,BOOK XV.,"The Greeks and Trojans fought, Patroclus still"
11898,BOOK XV.,Within the tent of brave Eurypylus
11899,BOOK XV.,"Remaining, with his converse sooth’d the chief,"
11900,BOOK XV.,"And healing unguents to his wound applied,"
11901,BOOK XV.,Of pow’r to charm away the bitter pains;
11902,BOOK XV.,"But when the Trojans pouring o’er the wall,"
11903,BOOK XV.,"And routed Greeks in panic flight he saw,"
11904,BOOK XV.,"Deeply he groan’d, and smiting on his thigh"
11905,BOOK XV.,"With either palm, in anguish thus he spoke:"
11906,BOOK XV.,
11907,BOOK XV.,"“Eurypylus, how great soe’er thy need,"
11908,BOOK XV.,I can no longer stay; so fierce the storm
11909,BOOK XV.,Of battle rages; but th’ attendants’ care
11910,BOOK XV.,Will all thy wants supply; while I in haste
11911,BOOK XV.,"Achilles seek, and urge him to the war;"
11912,BOOK XV.,Who knows but Heav’n may grant me to succeed?
11913,BOOK XV.,For great is oft a friend’s persuasive pow’r.”
11914,BOOK XV.,"He said, and quickly on his errand sped."
11915,BOOK XV.,
11916,BOOK XV.,"Meanwhile the Greeks, in firm array, endur’d"
11917,BOOK XV.,The onset of the Trojans; nor could these
11918,BOOK XV.,"The assailants, though in numbers less, repel;"
11919,BOOK XV.,"Nor those again the Grecian masses break,"
11920,BOOK XV.,"And force their passage through the ships and tents,"
11921,BOOK XV.,"As by a rule, in cunning workman’s hand,"
11922,BOOK XV.,"Who all his art by Pallas’ aid has learnt,"
11923,BOOK XV.,"A vessel’s plank is smooth and even laid,"
11924,BOOK XV.,So level lay the balance of the fight.
11925,BOOK XV.,"Others round other ships maintain’d the war,"
11926,BOOK XV.,But Hector that of Ajax sought alone.
11927,BOOK XV.,For that one ship they two unwearied toil’d;
11928,BOOK XV.,"Nor Hector Ajax from his post could move,"
11929,BOOK XV.,And burn the ship with fire; nor he repel
11930,BOOK XV.,The foe who came protected by a God.
11931,BOOK XV.,Then noble Ajax with his jav’lin smote
11932,BOOK XV.,"Caletor, son of Clytius, through the breast,"
11933,BOOK XV.,As tow’rd the ship a blazing torch he bore;
11934,BOOK XV.,"Thund’ring he fell, and dropp’d his hand the torch."
11935,BOOK XV.,"But Hector, when his eyes his kinsman saw"
11936,BOOK XV.,"By the dark vessel, prostrate in the dust,"
11937,BOOK XV.,On Trojans and on Lycians call’d aloud:
11938,BOOK XV.,
11939,BOOK XV.,"“Trojans and Lycians, and ye Dardans, fam’d"
11940,BOOK XV.,"In close encounter, in this press of war"
11941,BOOK XV.,Slack not your efforts; haste to save the son
11942,BOOK XV.,"Of Clytius, nor let Greeks his arms possess,"
11943,BOOK XV.,Who ’mid their throng of ships has nobly fall’n.”
11944,BOOK XV.,"At Ajax, as he spoke, his gleaming spear"
11945,BOOK XV.,"He threw, but miss’d his aim; yet Lycophron,"
11946,BOOK XV.,"His comrade, of Cythera, Mastor’s son"
11947,BOOK XV.,(Who flying from Cythera’s lovely isle
11948,BOOK XV.,"With guilt of bloodshed, near to Ajax dwelt),"
11949,BOOK XV.,"Standing beside the chief, above the ear"
11950,BOOK XV.,"He struck, and pierc’d the brain: from the tall prow"
11951,BOOK XV.,"Backwards he fell, his limbs relax’d in death."
11952,BOOK XV.,"Then Ajax, shudd’ring, on his brother call’d:"
11953,BOOK XV.,
11954,BOOK XV.,"“Good Teucer, we have lost a faithful friend,"
11955,BOOK XV.,"The son of Mastor, our Cytheran guest,"
11956,BOOK XV.,Whom as a father all rever’d; who now
11957,BOOK XV.,Lies slain by noble Hector. Where are then
11958,BOOK XV.,"Thine arrows, swift-wing’d messengers of fate,"
11959,BOOK XV.,"And where thy trusty bow, Apollo’s gift?”"
11960,BOOK XV.,
11961,BOOK XV.,"Thus Ajax; Teucer heard, and ran in haste,"
11962,BOOK XV.,"And stood beside him, with his bended bow,"
11963,BOOK XV.,And well-stor’d quiver: on the Trojans fast
11964,BOOK XV.,"He pour’d his shafts; and struck Pisenor’s son,"
11965,BOOK XV.,"Clitus, the comrade of Polydamas,"
11966,BOOK XV.,The noble son of Panthous; he the reins
11967,BOOK XV.,"Held in his hand, and all his care bestow’d"
11968,BOOK XV.,"To guide his horses; for, where’er the throng"
11969,BOOK XV.,"Was thickest, there in Hector’s cause, and Troy’s,"
11970,BOOK XV.,He still was found; but o’er him hung the doom
11971,BOOK XV.,Which none might turn aside; for from behind
11972,BOOK XV.,The fateful arrow struck him through the neck;
11973,BOOK XV.,"Down from the car he fell; swerving aside,"
11974,BOOK XV.,The startled horses whirl’d the empty car.
11975,BOOK XV.,"Them first the King Polydamas beheld,"
11976,BOOK XV.,"And stay’d their course; to Protiaon’s son,"
11977,BOOK XV.,"Astynous, then he gave them, with command"
11978,BOOK XV.,"To keep good watch, and still be near at hand;"
11979,BOOK XV.,Then ’mid the foremost join’d again the fray.
11980,BOOK XV.,Again at Hector of the brazen helm
11981,BOOK XV.,An arrow Teucer aim’d; and had the shaft
11982,BOOK XV.,"The life of Hector quench’d in mid career,"
11983,BOOK XV.,Not long the fight had rag’d around the ships:
11984,BOOK XV.,"But Jove’s all-seeing eye beheld, who watch’d"
11985,BOOK XV.,"O’er Hector’s life, and Teucer’s hopes deceiv’d."
11986,BOOK XV.,"The bow’s well-twisted string he snapp’d in twain,"
11987,BOOK XV.,As Teucer drew; the brass-tipp’d arrow flew
11988,BOOK XV.,"Wide of the mark, and dropp’d his hand the bow."
11989,BOOK XV.,"Then to his brother, all aghast, he cried:"
11990,BOOK XV.,"“O Heav’n, some God our best-laid schemes of war"
11991,BOOK XV.,"Confounds, who from my hand hath, wrench’d the bow,"
11992,BOOK XV.,"And snapp’d the newly-twisted string, which I"
11993,BOOK XV.,"But late attach’d, my swift-wing’d shafts to bear.”"
11994,BOOK XV.,
11995,BOOK XV.,Whom answer’d thus great Ajax Telamon:
11996,BOOK XV.,"“O friend, leave there thine arrows and thy bow,"
11997,BOOK XV.,Marr’d by some God who grudges our renown;
11998,BOOK XV.,"But take in hand thy pond’rous spear, and cast"
11999,BOOK XV.,"Thy shield about thy shoulders, and thyself"
12000,BOOK XV.,"Stand forth, and urge the rest, to face the foe."
12001,BOOK XV.,"Let us not tamely yield, if yield we must,"
12002,BOOK XV.,"Our well-built ships, but nobly dare the fight.”"
12003,BOOK XV.,
12004,BOOK XV.,“Thus Ajax spoke; and Teucer in the tent
12005,BOOK XV.,"Bestowed his bow, and o’er his shoulders threw"
12006,BOOK XV.,His fourfold shield; and on his firm-set head
12007,BOOK XV.,"A helm he plac’d, well-wrought, with horsehair plume,"
12008,BOOK XV.,"That nodded, fearful, o’er his brow; his hand"
12009,BOOK XV.,"Grasp’d the firm spear, with sharpen’d point of brass:"
12010,BOOK XV.,"Then ran, and swiftly stood by Ajax’ side."
12011,BOOK XV.,"Hector meanwhile, who saw the weapon marr’d,"
12012,BOOK XV.,To Trojans and to Lycians call’d aloud:
12013,BOOK XV.,
12014,BOOK XV.,"“Trojans and Lycians, and ye Dardans fam’d"
12015,BOOK XV.,"In close encounter, quit ye now like men;"
12016,BOOK XV.,Against the ships your wonted valour show.
12017,BOOK XV.,"E’en now, before our eyes, hath Jove destroy’d"
12018,BOOK XV.,A chieftain’s weapon. Easy ’tis to trace
12019,BOOK XV.,"O’er human wars th’ o’erruling hand of Jove,"
12020,BOOK XV.,"To whom he gives the prize of victory,"
12021,BOOK XV.,"And whom, withholding aid, he minishes,"
12022,BOOK XV.,"As now the Greeks, while we his favour gain."
12023,BOOK XV.,Pour then your force united on the ships;
12024,BOOK XV.,"And if there be among you, who this day"
12025,BOOK XV.,"Shall meet his doom, by sword or arrow slain,"
12026,BOOK XV.,E’en let him die! a glorious death is his
12027,BOOK XV.,"Who for his country falls; and dying, leaves"
12028,BOOK XV.,"Preserv’d from danger, children, wife, and home,"
12029,BOOK XV.,"His heritage uninjur’d, when the Greeks"
12030,BOOK XV.,Embarking hence shall take their homeward way.”
12031,BOOK XV.,
12032,BOOK XV.,His words fresh courage rous’d in ev’ry breast.
12033,BOOK XV.,"Ajax, on th’ other side, address’d the Greeks:"
12034,BOOK XV.,
12035,BOOK XV.,"“Shame on ye, Greeks! this very hour decides"
12036,BOOK XV.,"If we must perish, or be sav’d, and ward"
12037,BOOK XV.,Destruction from our ships; and can ye hope
12038,BOOK XV.,"That each, if Hector of the glancing helm"
12039,BOOK XV.,"Shall burn our ships, on foot can reach his home?"
12040,BOOK XV.,"Or hear ye not, how, burning to destroy"
12041,BOOK XV.,"Our vessels, Hector cheers his forces on?"
12042,BOOK XV.,"Not to the dance, but to the fight he calls;"
12043,BOOK XV.,"Nor better counsel can for us be found,"
12044,BOOK XV.,Than in close fight with heart and hand to join.
12045,BOOK XV.,"’Twere better far at once to die, than live"
12046,BOOK XV.,"Hemm’d in and straiten’d thus, in dire distress,"
12047,BOOK XV.,"Close to our ships, by meaner men beset.”"
12048,BOOK XV.,
12049,BOOK XV.,His words fresh courage rous’d in ev’ry breast.
12050,BOOK XV.,"Then Hector Schedius, Perimedes’ son,"
12051,BOOK XV.,"The Thracian leader, slew; on th’ other side"
12052,BOOK XV.,"Ajax the captain of the foot o’ercame,"
12053,BOOK XV.,"Laodamas, Antenor’s noble son;"
12054,BOOK XV.,While of his arms Polydamas despoil’d
12055,BOOK XV.,"Cyllenian Otus, friend of Phyleus’ son,"
12056,BOOK XV.,"The proud Epeians’ leader; Meges saw,"
12057,BOOK XV.,"And rush’d upon him; but Polydamas,"
12058,BOOK XV.,"Stooping, the blow evaded; him he miss’d;"
12059,BOOK XV.,For Phoebus will’d not Panthous’ son should fall
12060,BOOK XV.,In the front rank contending; but the spear
12061,BOOK XV.,"Smote Croesmus through the breast; thund’ring he fell,"
12062,BOOK XV.,And from his corpse the victor stripp’d his arms.
12063,BOOK XV.,"Him Dolops, son of Lampus, spearman skill’d,"
12064,BOOK XV.,"Well train’d in ev’ry point of war, assail’d"
12065,BOOK XV.,"(The son of Lampus he, the prince of men,"
12066,BOOK XV.,Son of Laomedon); from close at hand
12067,BOOK XV.,"Forward he sprang, and thrust at Meges’ shield;"
12068,BOOK XV.,"But him the solid corslet which he wore,"
12069,BOOK XV.,"With breast and back-piece fitted, sav’d from harm:*"
12070,BOOK XV.,"The corslet Phyleus brought from Ephyra,"
12071,BOOK XV.,"By Selles’ stream; Euphetes, King of men,"
12072,BOOK XV.,"Bestow’d it as a friendly gift, to wear"
12073,BOOK XV.,In battle for a guard from hostile spears;
12074,BOOK XV.,Which from destruction now preserv’d his son.
12075,BOOK XV.,"Next Meges struck, with keen-edg’d spear, the crown"
12076,BOOK XV.,"Of Dolops’ brass-bound, horsehair-crested helm,"
12077,BOOK XV.,"Sev’ring the horsehair plume, which, brilliant late"
12078,BOOK XV.,"With crimson dye, now lay defil’d in dust."
12079,BOOK XV.,"Yet fought he on, and still for vict’ry hop’d;"
12080,BOOK XV.,But warlike Menelaus to the aid
12081,BOOK XV.,Of Meges came; of Dolops unobserv’d
12082,BOOK XV.,"He stood, and from behind his shoulder pierc’d;"
12083,BOOK XV.,"The point, its course pursuing, through his breast"
12084,BOOK XV.,"Was driv’n, and headlong on his face he fell."
12085,BOOK XV.,"Forthwith, advanc’d the two to seize the spoils;"
12086,BOOK XV.,But loudly Hector on his kinsmen call’d;
12087,BOOK XV.,"On all, but chief on Icetaon’s son,"
12088,BOOK XV.,"The valiant Melanippus; he erewhile,"
12089,BOOK XV.,"In far Percote, ere the foes appear’d,"
12090,BOOK XV.,Pastur’d his herds; but when the ships of Greece
12091,BOOK XV.,"Approach’d the shore, to Ilium back he came;"
12092,BOOK XV.,"There, ’mid the Trojans eminent, he dwelt"
12093,BOOK XV.,"In Priam’s house, belov’d as Priam’s son."
12094,BOOK XV.,"Him Hector call’d by name, and thus address’d:"
12095,BOOK XV.,
12096,BOOK XV.,"“Why, Melanippus, stand we idly thus?"
12097,BOOK XV.,Doth not thy slaughter’d kinsmen touch thy heart?
12098,BOOK XV.,See how they rush on Dolops’ arms to seize;
12099,BOOK XV.,"Then on! no distant war must now be wag’d,"
12100,BOOK XV.,"But hand to hand, till or the Greeks be slain,"
12101,BOOK XV.,"Or lofty Troy, with all her children, fall.”"
12102,BOOK XV.,
12103,BOOK XV.,"He said, and led the way; him follow’d straight"
12104,BOOK XV.,The godlike chief; great Ajax Telamon
12105,BOOK XV.,"Meanwhile the Greeks encourag’d to the fight,"
12106,BOOK XV.,"And cried, “Brave comrades, quit ye now like men;"
12107,BOOK XV.,Bear a stout heart; and in the stubborn fight
12108,BOOK XV.,Let each to other mutual succour give;
12109,BOOK XV.,By mutual succour more are sav’d than fall;
12110,BOOK XV.,In timid flight nor fame nor safety lies.”
12111,BOOK XV.,
12112,BOOK XV.,"He said; and pond’ring well his words, they stood,"
12113,BOOK XV.,Firm in defence; as with a wall of brass
12114,BOOK XV.,The ships they guarded; though against them Jove
12115,BOOK XV.,Led on the Trojans; Menelaus then
12116,BOOK XV.,With stirring words Antilochus address’d:
12117,BOOK XV.,"“Antilochus, than thou, of all the Greeks"
12118,BOOK XV.,"Is none more active, or more light of foot;"
12119,BOOK XV.,None stronger hurls the spear; then from the crowd
12120,BOOK XV.,"Spring forth, and aim to reach some Trojan’s life.”"
12121,BOOK XV.,
12122,BOOK XV.,"Thus saying, he withdrew; fir’d by his words,"
12123,BOOK XV.,"Forth sprang the youth, and pois’d his glitt’ring spear,"
12124,BOOK XV.,Glancing around him; back the Trojans drew
12125,BOOK XV.,Before his aim; nor flew the spear in vain;
12126,BOOK XV.,"But through the breast it pierc’d, as on he came,"
12127,BOOK XV.,"Brave Melanippus, Icetaon’s son."
12128,BOOK XV.,"Thund’ring he fell, and loud his armour rang."
12129,BOOK XV.,"Forth sprang Antilochus, as springs a hound"
12130,BOOK XV.,"Upon a fawn, which from its lair disturb’d"
12131,BOOK XV.,"A hunter’s shaft has struck, and quell’d its pow’rs;"
12132,BOOK XV.,"So, Melanippus, sprang to seize thy spoils"
12133,BOOK XV.,The stout Antilochus; but not unmark’d
12134,BOOK XV.,"Of Hector’s eye, who, hast’ning through the press,"
12135,BOOK XV.,"Advanc’d to meet him; waited not th’ attack,"
12136,BOOK XV.,"Bold warrior as he was, Antilochus,"
12137,BOOK XV.,"But trembling fled: as when a beast of prey,"
12138,BOOK XV.,"Conscious of evil deed, amid the herd"
12139,BOOK XV.,"The guardian dog or herdsman’s self has slain,"
12140,BOOK XV.,"And flies, ere yet th’ avenging crowd collect;"
12141,BOOK XV.,"So fled the son of Nestor; onward press’d,"
12142,BOOK XV.,"By Hector led, the Trojans; loud their shouts,"
12143,BOOK XV.,As on the Greeks their murd’rous shafts they pour’d:
12144,BOOK XV.,"Yet turn’d he, when his comrades’ ranks he reach’d."
12145,BOOK XV.,"Then on the ships, as rav’ning lions, fell"
12146,BOOK XV.,"The Trojans: they but work’d the will of Jove,"
12147,BOOK XV.,"Who still their courage rais’d, and quell’d the Greeks;"
12148,BOOK XV.,"Of vict’ry these debarr’d, and those inspir’d;"
12149,BOOK XV.,"For so he will’d, that Hector, Priam’s son,"
12150,BOOK XV.,"Should wrap in fire the beaked ships of Greece,"
12151,BOOK XV.,And Thetis to the uttermost obtain
12152,BOOK XV.,"Her over-bold petition; yet did Jove,"
12153,BOOK XV.,"The Lord of counsel, wait but to behold"
12154,BOOK XV.,The flames ascending from the blazing ships:
12155,BOOK XV.,"For from that hour the Trojans, backward driv’n,"
12156,BOOK XV.,Should to the Greeks the final triumph leave.
12157,BOOK XV.,"With such design, to seize the ships, he fir’d"
12158,BOOK XV.,Th’ already burning zeal of Priam’s son;
12159,BOOK XV.,"Fiercely he rag’d, as terrible as Mars"
12160,BOOK XV.,With brandish’d spear; or as a raging fire
12161,BOOK XV.,’Mid the dense thickets on the mountain side.
12162,BOOK XV.,The foam was on his lips; bright flash’d his eyes
12163,BOOK XV.,"Beneath his awful brows, and terribly"
12164,BOOK XV.,Above his temples wav’d amid the fray
12165,BOOK XV.,The helm of Hector; Jove himself from Heav’n.
12166,BOOK XV.,"His guardian hand extending, him alone"
12167,BOOK XV.,With glory crowning ’mid the host of men;
12168,BOOK XV.,But short his term of glory: for the day
12169,BOOK XV.,"Was fast approaching, when, with Pallas’ aid,"
12170,BOOK XV.,The might of Peleus’ son should work his doom.
12171,BOOK XV.,"Oft he essay’d to break the ranks, where’er"
12172,BOOK XV.,The densest and throng noblest arms he saw;
12173,BOOK XV.,"But strenuous though his efforts, all were vain:"
12174,BOOK XV.,"They, mass’d in close array, his charge withstood;"
12175,BOOK XV.,"Firm as a craggy rock, upstanding high,"
12176,BOOK XV.,"Close by the hoary sea, which meets unmov’d"
12177,BOOK XV.,"The boist’rous currents of the whistling winds,"
12178,BOOK XV.,And the big waves that bellow round its base;
12179,BOOK XV.,"So stood unmov’d the Greeks, and undismay’d."
12180,BOOK XV.,"At length, all blazing in his arms, he sprang"
12181,BOOK XV.,"Upon the mass; so plunging down, as when"
12182,BOOK XV.,"On some tall vessel, from beneath the clouds"
12183,BOOK XV.,"A giant billow, tempest-nurs’d, descends;"
12184,BOOK XV.,The deck is drench’d in foam; the stormy wind
12185,BOOK XV.,Howls in the shrouds; th’ affrighted seamen quail
12186,BOOK XV.,"In fear, but little way from death remov’d;"
12187,BOOK XV.,So quail’d the spirit in ev’ry Grecian breast.
12188,BOOK XV.,
12189,BOOK XV.,As when a rav’ning lion on a herd
12190,BOOK XV.,"Of heifers falls, which on some marshy mead"
12191,BOOK XV.,"Feed numberless, beneath the care of one,"
12192,BOOK XV.,Unskill’d from beasts of prey to guard his charge;
12193,BOOK XV.,"And while beside the front or rear he walks,"
12194,BOOK XV.,"The lion on th’ unguarded centre springs,"
12195,BOOK XV.,"Seizes on one, and scatters all the rest;"
12196,BOOK XV.,"So Hector, led by Jove, in wild alarm"
12197,BOOK XV.,"Scatter’d the Grecians all; but one alone,"
12198,BOOK XV.,"Brave Periphetes, of Mycenæ, slew;"
12199,BOOK XV.,"The son of Copreus, whom Eurystheus sent"
12200,BOOK XV.,His envoy to the might of Hercules;
12201,BOOK XV.,Far nobler than the father was the son;
12202,BOOK XV.,"In speed of foot, in warlike might, in mind,"
12203,BOOK XV.,"In all, among Mycenians foremost he;"
12204,BOOK XV.,Who now on Hector fresh renown conferr’d;
12205,BOOK XV.,"For, backward as he stepp’d, against the rim"
12206,BOOK XV.,"Of the broad shield which for defence he bore,"
12207,BOOK XV.,"Down reaching to his feet, he tripp’d, and thus"
12208,BOOK XV.,"Entangled, backward fell; and as he fell,"
12209,BOOK XV.,Around his temples clatter’d loud his helm.
12210,BOOK XV.,"Hector beheld, and o’er him stood in haste,"
12211,BOOK XV.,"And with his spear transfix’d his breast, and slew"
12212,BOOK XV.,"Before his comrades’ eyes; yet dar’d not one,"
12213,BOOK XV.,"Though grieving for their comrade’s loss, advance"
12214,BOOK XV.,To rescue; such of Hector was their awe.
12215,BOOK XV.,They fronted now the ships; the leading prows
12216,BOOK XV.,"Which first were drawn on shore, still barr’d their way;"
12217,BOOK XV.,"Yet on they stream’d; and from the foremost ships,"
12218,BOOK XV.,"Now hardly press’d, the Greeks perforce retir’d;"
12219,BOOK XV.,"But closely mass’d before the tents they stood,"
12220,BOOK XV.,"Not scatter’d o’er the camp; by shame restrain’d,"
12221,BOOK XV.,And fear; and loudly each exhorted each.
12222,BOOK XV.,"Gerenian Nestor chief, the prop of Greece,"
12223,BOOK XV.,Thus by their fathers singly each adjur’d:
12224,BOOK XV.,"“Quit ye like men, dear friends; and think it shame"
12225,BOOK XV.,To forfeit now the praise of other men;
12226,BOOK XV.,"Let each man now his children and his wife,"
12227,BOOK XV.,"His fortunes and his parents, bear in mind;"
12228,BOOK XV.,"And not the living only, but the dead;"
12229,BOOK XV.,"For them, the absent, I, your suppliant, pray,"
12230,BOOK XV.,"That firm ye stand, and scorn disgraceful flight.”"
12231,BOOK XV.,
12232,BOOK XV.,His words fresh courage rous’d in ev’ry breast;
12233,BOOK XV.,And from their eyeballs Pallas purg’d away
12234,BOOK XV.,"The film of darkness; and on ev’ry side,"
12235,BOOK XV.,"Both tow’rd the ships and tow’rd the level fight,"
12236,BOOK XV.,"Clear light diffus’d; there Hector they discern’d,"
12237,BOOK XV.,"And all his comrades, those who stood aloof,"
12238,BOOK XV.,And those who near the ships maintain’d the war.
12239,BOOK XV.,Then was not Ajax’ mighty soul content
12240,BOOK XV.,To stand where stood the other sons of Greece;
12241,BOOK XV.,Along the vessels’ lofty decks he mov’d
12242,BOOK XV.,"With haughty stride; a pond’rous boarding-pike,"
12243,BOOK XV.,"Well polish’d, and with rivets well secur’d,"
12244,BOOK XV.,"Of two and twenty cubits’ length, he bore,"
12245,BOOK XV.,"As one well-skill’d in feats of horsemanship,"
12246,BOOK XV.,Who from a troop of horses on the plain
12247,BOOK XV.,"Has parted four, and down the crowded road,"
12248,BOOK XV.,"While men and women all in wonder gaze,"
12249,BOOK XV.,Drives tow’rd the city; and with force untir’d
12250,BOOK XV.,"From one to other springs, as on they fly;"
12251,BOOK XV.,O’er many a vessel’s deck so Ajax pass’d
12252,BOOK XV.,"With lofty stride, and voice that reach’d to Heav’n,"
12253,BOOK XV.,As loudly shouting on the Greeks he call’d
12254,BOOK XV.,To save their ships and tents: nor Hector stay’d
12255,BOOK XV.,Amid the closely buckler’d Trojan ranks;
12256,BOOK XV.,"But, as upon a flock of birds, that feed"
12257,BOOK XV.,"Beside a river’s bank, or geese, or cranes,"
12258,BOOK XV.,"Or long-neck’d swans, a fiery eagle swoops;"
12259,BOOK XV.,So on the dark-prow’d ship with furious rush
12260,BOOK XV.,Swept Hector down; him Jove with mighty hand
12261,BOOK XV.,"Sustain’d, and with him forward urg’d the crowd."
12262,BOOK XV.,Fierce round the ships again the battle rag’d;
12263,BOOK XV.,Well might ye deem no previous toil had worn
12264,BOOK XV.,"Their strength, who in that dread encounter met;"
12265,BOOK XV.,"With edge so keen, and stubborn will they fought."
12266,BOOK XV.,But varying far their hopes and fears: the Greeks
12267,BOOK XV.,Of safety and escape from death despair’d;
12268,BOOK XV.,"While high the hopes in ev’ry Trojan’s breast,"
12269,BOOK XV.,"To burn the ships, and slay the warlike Greeks;"
12270,BOOK XV.,"So minded each, oppos’d in arms they stood."
12271,BOOK XV.,
12272,BOOK XV.,"On a swift-sailing vessel’s stern, that bore"
12273,BOOK XV.,"Protesilaus to the coast of Troy,"
12274,BOOK XV.,"But to his native country bore not thence,"
12275,BOOK XV.,Hector had laid his hand; around that ship
12276,BOOK XV.,Trojans and Greeks in mutual slaughter join’d.
12277,BOOK XV.,The arrow’s or the jav’lin’s distant flight
12278,BOOK XV.,"They waited not, but, fir’d with equal rage,"
12279,BOOK XV.,"Fought hand to hand, with axe and hatchet keen,"
12280,BOOK XV.,"And mighty swords, and double-pointed spears."
12281,BOOK XV.,"Many a fair-hilted blade, with iron bound,"
12282,BOOK XV.,"Dropp’d from the hands, or from the sever’d arms,"
12283,BOOK XV.,Of warrior chiefs; the dark earth ran with blood:
12284,BOOK XV.,"Yet loos’d not Hector of the stern his hold,"
12285,BOOK XV.,"But grasp’d the poop, and on the Trojans call’d;"
12286,BOOK XV.,
12287,BOOK XV.,"“Bring fire, and all together loud and clear"
12288,BOOK XV.,Your war-cry raise; this day will Jove repay
12289,BOOK XV.,"Our labours all, with capture of those ships,"
12290,BOOK XV.,"Which hither came, against the will of Heav’n,"
12291,BOOK XV.,"And which on us unnumber’d ills have brought,"
12292,BOOK XV.,"By our own Elders’ fault, who me, desiring"
12293,BOOK XV.,"Ev’n at their vessels’ sterns to urge the war,"
12294,BOOK XV.,"Withheld, and to the town the troops confin’d."
12295,BOOK XV.,"But Jove all-seeing, if he then o’errul’d"
12296,BOOK XV.,"Our better mind, himself is now our aid.”"
12297,BOOK XV.,
12298,BOOK XV.,Thus he: they onward press’d with added zeal;
12299,BOOK XV.,"Nor Ajax yet endur’d, by hostile spears"
12300,BOOK XV.,"Now sorely gall’d; yet but a little space,"
12301,BOOK XV.,"Back to the helmsman’s sev’n-foot board he mov’d,"
12302,BOOK XV.,"Expecting death; and left the lofty deck,"
12303,BOOK XV.,Where long he stood on guard; but still his spear
12304,BOOK XV.,"The Trojans kept aloof, whoe’er essay’d"
12305,BOOK XV.,Amid the ships to launch th’ unwearied flames;
12306,BOOK XV.,"And, loudly shouting, to the Greeks he call’d:"
12307,BOOK XV.,
12308,BOOK XV.,"“Friends, Grecian heroes, ministers of Mars,"
12309,BOOK XV.,"Quit ye like men! dear friends, remember now"
12310,BOOK XV.,Your wonted valour! think ye in your rear
12311,BOOK XV.,"To find supporting forces, or some fort"
12312,BOOK XV.,Whose walls may give you refuge from your foe?
12313,BOOK XV.,"No city is nigh, whose well-appointed tow’rs,"
12314,BOOK XV.,"Mann’d by a friendly race, may give us aid;"
12315,BOOK XV.,"But here, upon the well-arm’d Trojans’ soil,"
12316,BOOK XV.,"And only resting on the sea, we lie"
12317,BOOK XV.,"Far from our country; not in faint retreat,"
12318,BOOK XV.,"But in our own good arms, our safety lies.”"
12319,BOOK XV.,
12320,BOOK XV.,He said; and with his sharp-edg’d spear his words
12321,BOOK XV.,"He follow’d up; if any Trojan dar’d,"
12322,BOOK XV.,"By Hector’s call inspir’d, with fiery brand"
12323,BOOK XV.,"To assail the ships, him with his ponderous spear"
12324,BOOK XV.,Would Ajax meet; and thus before the ships
12325,BOOK XV.,"Twelve warriors, hand to hand, his prowess felt."

12351,BOOK XVI.,
12352,BOOK XVI.,Thus round the well-mann’d ship they wag’d the war:
12353,BOOK XVI.,"Meanwhile by Peleus’ son Patroclus stood,"
12354,BOOK XVI.,Weeping hot tears; as some dark-water’d fount
12355,BOOK XVI.,Pours o’er a craggy rock its gloomy stream;
12356,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles, swift of foot, with pity saw,"
12357,BOOK XVI.,And to his friend these winged words address’d:
12358,BOOK XVI.,
12359,BOOK XVI.,"“Why weeps Patroclus, like an infant girl,"
12360,BOOK XVI.,"That prays her mother, by whose side she runs,"
12361,BOOK XVI.,"To take her up; and, clinging to her gown,"
12362,BOOK XVI.,"Impedes her way, and still with tearful eyes"
12363,BOOK XVI.,"Looks in her face, until she take her up?"
12364,BOOK XVI.,"Ev’n as that girl, Patroclus, such art thou,"
12365,BOOK XVI.,Shedding soft tears: hast thou some tidings brought
12366,BOOK XVI.,"Touching the gen’ral weal, or me alone?"
12367,BOOK XVI.,"Or have some evil news from Phthia come,"
12368,BOOK XVI.,"Known but to thee? Menoetius, Actor’s son,"
12369,BOOK XVI.,Yet surely lives; and ’mid his Myrmidons
12370,BOOK XVI.,"Lives aged Peleus, son of Æacus:"
12371,BOOK XVI.,Their deaths indeed might well demand our tears:
12372,BOOK XVI.,"Or weep’st thou for the Greeks, who round their ships"
12373,BOOK XVI.,By death their former insolence repay?
12374,BOOK XVI.,"Speak out, that I may know thy cause of grief.”"
12375,BOOK XVI.,
12376,BOOK XVI.,"To whom, with bitter groans, Patroclus thus:"
12377,BOOK XVI.,"“O son of Peleus, noblest of the Greeks,"
12378,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles, be not wroth! such weight of woe"
12379,BOOK XVI.,The Grecian camp oppresses; in their ships
12380,BOOK XVI.,"They who were late their bravest and their best,"
12381,BOOK XVI.,Sore wounded all by spear or arrow lie;
12382,BOOK XVI.,"The valiant son of Tydeus, Diomed,"
12383,BOOK XVI.,"Pierc’d by a shaft, Ulysses by a spear,"
12384,BOOK XVI.,And Agamemnon’s self; Eurypylus
12385,BOOK XVI.,By a sharp arrow through the thigh transfix’d;
12386,BOOK XVI.,"For these, the large resources of their art"
12387,BOOK XVI.,"The leeches ply, and on their wounds attend;"
12388,BOOK XVI.,"While thou, Achilles, still remain’st unmov’d."
12389,BOOK XVI.,"Oh, be it never mine to nurse such hate"
12390,BOOK XVI.,"As thou retain’st, inflexibly severe!"
12391,BOOK XVI.,Who e’er may hope in future days by thee
12392,BOOK XVI.,"To profit, if thou now forbear to save"
12393,BOOK XVI.,The Greeks from shame and loss? Unfeeling man!
12394,BOOK XVI.,"Sure Peleus, horseman brave, was ne’er thy sire,"
12395,BOOK XVI.,Nor Thetis bore thee; from the cold grey sea
12396,BOOK XVI.,And craggy rocks thou hadst thy birth; so hard
12397,BOOK XVI.,And stubborn is thy soul. But if the fear
12398,BOOK XVI.,"Of evil prophesied thyself restrain,"
12399,BOOK XVI.,Or message by thy Goddess-mother brought
12400,BOOK XVI.,"From Jove, yet send me forth with all thy force"
12401,BOOK XVI.,"Of Myrmidons, to be the saving light"
12402,BOOK XVI.,Of Greece; and let me to the battle bear
12403,BOOK XVI.,"Thy glitt’ring arms, if so the men of Troy,"
12404,BOOK XVI.,"Scar’d by thy likeness, may forsake the field,"
12405,BOOK XVI.,"And breathing-time afford the sons of Greece,"
12406,BOOK XVI.,Toil-worn; for little pause has yet been theirs.
12407,BOOK XVI.,"Fresh and unwearied, we may drive with ease"
12408,BOOK XVI.,"To their own city, from our ships and tents,"
12409,BOOK XVI.,"The Trojans, worn and battle-wearied men.”"
12410,BOOK XVI.,
12411,BOOK XVI.,"Thus pray’d he, all unwisely; for the pray’r"
12412,BOOK XVI.,"He utter’d, to himself was fraught with death;"
12413,BOOK XVI.,"To whom, much griev’d, Achilles, swift of foot:"
12414,BOOK XVI.,"“Heav’n-born Patroclus, oh, what words are these!"
12415,BOOK XVI.,"Of prophecy I reck not, though I know;"
12416,BOOK XVI.,Nor message hath my mother brought from Jove;
12417,BOOK XVI.,But it afflicts my soul; when one I see
12418,BOOK XVI.,"That basely robs his equal of his prize,"
12419,BOOK XVI.,"His lawful prize, by highest valour won;"
12420,BOOK XVI.,"Such grief is mine, such wrong have I sustain’d."
12421,BOOK XVI.,"Her, whom the sons of Greece on me bestow’d,"
12422,BOOK XVI.,"Prize of my spear, the well-wall’d city storm’d,"
12423,BOOK XVI.,"The mighty Agamemnon, Atreus’ son,"
12424,BOOK XVI.,"Hath borne by force away, as from the hands"
12425,BOOK XVI.,"Of some dishonour’d, houseless vagabond."
12426,BOOK XVI.,But let the past be past; I never meant
12427,BOOK XVI.,My wrath should have no end; yet had not thought
12428,BOOK XVI.,"My anger to abate, till my own ships"
12429,BOOK XVI.,"Should hear the war-cry, and the battle bear,"
12430,BOOK XVI.,"But go, and in my well-known armour clad,"
12431,BOOK XVI.,"Lead forth the valiant Myrmidons to war,"
12432,BOOK XVI.,Since the dark cloud of Trojans circles round
12433,BOOK XVI.,"The ships in force; and on the shingly beach,"
12434,BOOK XVI.,"Pent up in narrow limits, lie the Greeks;"
12435,BOOK XVI.,And all the city hath pour’d its numbers forth
12436,BOOK XVI.,In hope undoubting; for they see no more
12437,BOOK XVI.,My helm among them flashing; else in flight
12438,BOOK XVI.,"Their dead would choke the streams, if but to me"
12439,BOOK XVI.,Great Agamemnon bore a kindly mind:
12440,BOOK XVI.,But round the camp the battle now is wag’d.
12441,BOOK XVI.,"No more the hands of valiant Diomed,"
12442,BOOK XVI.,"The Greeks protecting, hurl his fiery spear;"
12443,BOOK XVI.,"Nor hear I now, from his detested lips,"
12444,BOOK XVI.,The shout of Agamemnon; all around
12445,BOOK XVI.,"Is heard the warrior-slayer Hector’s voice,"
12446,BOOK XVI.,Cheering his Trojans; with triumphant cries
12447,BOOK XVI.,"They, from the vanquish’d Greeks, hold all the plain."
12448,BOOK XVI.,"Nathless do thou, Patroclus, in defence"
12449,BOOK XVI.,"Fall boldly on, lest they with blazing fire"
12450,BOOK XVI.,"Our ships destroy, and hinder our retreat."
12451,BOOK XVI.,"But hear, and ponder well the end of all"
12452,BOOK XVI.,"I have to say, and so for me obtain"
12453,BOOK XVI.,Honour and glory in the eyes of Greece;
12454,BOOK XVI.,And that the beauteous maiden to my arms
12455,BOOK XVI.,"They may restore, with costly gifts to boot."
12456,BOOK XVI.,"The ships reliev’d, return forthwith; and though"
12457,BOOK XVI.,"The Thund’rer, Juno’s Lord, should crown thine arms"
12458,BOOK XVI.,"With triumph, be not rash, apart from me,"
12459,BOOK XVI.,In combat with the warlike sons of Troy;
12460,BOOK XVI.,(So should my name in less repute be held;)
12461,BOOK XVI.,"Nor, in the keen excitement of the fight"
12462,BOOK XVI.,"And slaughter of the Trojans, lead thy troops"
12463,BOOK XVI.,"On tow’rd the city, lest thou find thyself"
12464,BOOK XVI.,By some one of th’ immortal Gods oppos’d;
12465,BOOK XVI.,For the far-darting Phoebus loves them well;
12466,BOOK XVI.,"But when in safety thou hast plac’d the ships,"
12467,BOOK XVI.,"Delay not to return, and leave the rest"
12468,BOOK XVI.,"To battle on the plain: for would to Jove,"
12469,BOOK XVI.,"To Pallas and Apollo, that not one,"
12470,BOOK XVI.,"Or Greek or Trojan, might escape from death,"
12471,BOOK XVI.,Save only thou and I; that so we two
12472,BOOK XVI.,Alone might raze the sacred tow’rs of Troy.”
12473,BOOK XVI.,
12474,BOOK XVI.,Such converse held they; while by hostile spears
12475,BOOK XVI.,"Hard press’d, no longer Ajax might endure;"
12476,BOOK XVI.,At once by Jove’s high will and Trojan foes
12477,BOOK XVI.,O’ermaster’d; loud beneath repeated blows
12478,BOOK XVI.,"Clatter’d around his brow the glitt’ring helm,"
12479,BOOK XVI.,As on the well-wrought crest the weapons fell;
12480,BOOK XVI.,"And his left arm grew faint, that long had borne"
12481,BOOK XVI.,The burthen of his shield; yet nought avail’d
12482,BOOK XVI.,The press of spears to drive him from his post;
12483,BOOK XVI.,"Lab’ring he drew his breath, his ev’ry limb"
12484,BOOK XVI.,With sweat was reeking; breathing space was none;
12485,BOOK XVI.,Blow follow’d blow; and ills were heap’d on ill.
12486,BOOK XVI.,
12487,BOOK XVI.,"Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell,"
12488,BOOK XVI.,How first the fire assail’d the Grecian ships.
12489,BOOK XVI.,
12490,BOOK XVI.,"Hector approach’d, and on the ashen spear"
12491,BOOK XVI.,"Of Ajax, close behind the head, let fall"
12492,BOOK XVI.,His mighty sword; right through he clove the wood;
12493,BOOK XVI.,And in his hand the son of Telamon
12494,BOOK XVI.,"The headless shaft held bootless; far away,"
12495,BOOK XVI.,"Loud ringing, fell to earth the brazen point."
12496,BOOK XVI.,"Ajax, dismayed, perceived the hand of Heaven,"
12497,BOOK XVI.,And knew that Jove the Thunderer had decreed
12498,BOOK XVI.,"To thwart his hopes, and victory give to Troy."
12499,BOOK XVI.,Slow he retir’d; and to the vessel they
12500,BOOK XVI.,The blazing torch applied; high rose the flame
12501,BOOK XVI.,"Unquenchable, and wrapp’d the poop in fire."
12502,BOOK XVI.,"The son of Peleus saw, and with his palm"
12503,BOOK XVI.,"Smote on his thigh, and to Patroclus call’d:"
12504,BOOK XVI.,"“Up, nobly born Patroclus, car-borne chief!"
12505,BOOK XVI.,"Up, for I see above the ships ascend"
12506,BOOK XVI.,"The hostile fires; and lest they seize the ships,"
12507,BOOK XVI.,"And hinder our retreat, do thou in haste"
12508,BOOK XVI.,"Thine armour don, while I arouse the troops.”"
12509,BOOK XVI.,
12510,BOOK XVI.,He said: his dazzling arms Patroclus donn’d:
12511,BOOK XVI.,"First on his legs the well-wrought greaves he fix’d,"
12512,BOOK XVI.,Fasten’d with silver clasps; his ample chest
12513,BOOK XVI.,"The breastplate of Achilles, swift of foot,"
12514,BOOK XVI.,"Star-spangled, richly wrought, defended well;"
12515,BOOK XVI.,"Around his shoulders slung, his sword he bore,"
12516,BOOK XVI.,"Brass-bladed, silver-studded; next his shield"
12517,BOOK XVI.,Weighty and strong; and on his firm-set head
12518,BOOK XVI.,"A helm he wore, well-wrought, with horsehair plume"
12519,BOOK XVI.,"That nodded, fearful, o’er his brow; his hand"
12520,BOOK XVI.,"Grasp’d two stout spears, familiar to his hold."
12521,BOOK XVI.,"One spear Achilles had, long, pond’rous, tough;"
12522,BOOK XVI.,"But this he touch’d not; none of all the Greeks,"
12523,BOOK XVI.,"None, save Achilles’ self, that spear could poise;"
12524,BOOK XVI.,"The far-fam’d Pelian ash, which to his sire,"
12525,BOOK XVI.,"On Pelion’s summit fell’d, to be the bane"
12526,BOOK XVI.,"Of mightiest chiefs, the Centaur Chiron gave."
12527,BOOK XVI.,Then to Automedon he gave command
12528,BOOK XVI.,"To yoke the horses: him he honour’d most,"
12529,BOOK XVI.,Next to Achilles’ self; the trustiest he
12530,BOOK XVI.,In battle to await his chief’s behest.
12531,BOOK XVI.,"The flying steeds he harness’d to the car,"
12532,BOOK XVI.,"Xanthus and Balius, fleeter than the winds;"
12533,BOOK XVI.,"Whom, grazing in the marsh by ocean’s stream,"
12534,BOOK XVI.,"Podarge, swift of foot, to Zephyr bore:"
12535,BOOK XVI.,"And by their side the matchless Pedasus,"
12536,BOOK XVI.,Whom from the capture of Eetion’s town
12537,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles bore away; a mortal horse,"
12538,BOOK XVI.,But with immortal coursers meet to vie.
12539,BOOK XVI.,
12540,BOOK XVI.,"Meantime Achilles, through their several tents,"
12541,BOOK XVI.,Summon’d to arms the warlike Myrmidons.
12542,BOOK XVI.,"They all, like rav’ning wolves, of courage high,"
12543,BOOK XVI.,That on the mountain side have hunted down
12544,BOOK XVI.,"An antler’d stag, and batten’d on his flesh:"
12545,BOOK XVI.,"Their chaps all dyed with blood, in troops they go,"
12546,BOOK XVI.,With their lean tongues from some black-water’d fount
12547,BOOK XVI.,"To lap the surface of the dark cool wave,"
12548,BOOK XVI.,"Their jaws with blood yet reeking, unsubdued"
12549,BOOK XVI.,"Their courage, and their bellies gorg’d with flesh;"
12550,BOOK XVI.,So round Pelides’ valiant follower throng’d
12551,BOOK XVI.,The chiefs and rulers of the Myrmidons.
12552,BOOK XVI.,Achilles in the midst to charioteers
12553,BOOK XVI.,And buckler’d warriors issued his commands.
12554,BOOK XVI.,"Fifty swift ships Achilles, dear to Jove,"
12555,BOOK XVI.,Led to the coast of Troy; and rang’d in each
12556,BOOK XVI.,Fifty brave comrades mann’d the rowers’ seats.
12557,BOOK XVI.,"O’er these five chiefs, on whom he most relied,"
12558,BOOK XVI.,"He plac’d, himself the Sov’reign Lord of all."
12559,BOOK XVI.,"One band Menestheus led, with glancing mail,"
12560,BOOK XVI.,"Son of Sperchius, Heav’n-descended stream;"
12561,BOOK XVI.,"Him Peleus’ daughter, Polydora fair,"
12562,BOOK XVI.,"A mortal in a God’s embrace compress’d,"
12563,BOOK XVI.,"To stout Sperchius bore; but, by repute,"
12564,BOOK XVI.,"To Boras, Perieres’ son, who her"
12565,BOOK XVI.,"In public, and with ample dow’r, espous’d."
12566,BOOK XVI.,"The brave Eudorus led the second band,"
12567,BOOK XVI.,"Whom Phylas’ daughter, Polymele fair,"
12568,BOOK XVI.,"To Hermes bore; the maid he saw, and lov’d,"
12569,BOOK XVI.,"Amid the virgins, mingling in the dance"
12570,BOOK XVI.,"Of golden-shafted Dian, Huntress-Queen;"
12571,BOOK XVI.,"He to her chamber access found, and gain’d"
12572,BOOK XVI.,"By stealth her bed; a valiant son she bore,"
12573,BOOK XVI.,"Eudorus, swift of foot, in battle strong."
12574,BOOK XVI.,"But when her infant, by Lucina’s aid,"
12575,BOOK XVI.,"Was brought to light, and saw the face of day,"
12576,BOOK XVI.,"Her to his home, with ample dow’r enrich’d,"
12577,BOOK XVI.,"Echecles, son of Actor, bore away;"
12578,BOOK XVI.,"While him the aged Phylas kept, and nurs’d"
12579,BOOK XVI.,"With tender care, and cherish’d—as his own."
12580,BOOK XVI.,"The brave Peisander, son of Maemalus,"
12581,BOOK XVI.,"The third commanded; of the Myrmidons,"
12582,BOOK XVI.,"Next to Pelides’ friend, the noblest spear."
12583,BOOK XVI.,"The fourth, the aged warrior Phoenix led;"
12584,BOOK XVI.,"The fifth, Alcimedon, Laerces’ son:"
12585,BOOK XVI.,These in their order due Achilles first
12586,BOOK XVI.,"Array’d, and next with stirring words address’d:"
12587,BOOK XVI.,
12588,BOOK XVI.,"“Ye Myrmidons, forget not now the vaunts"
12589,BOOK XVI.,"Which, while my wrath endur’d, ye largely pour’d"
12590,BOOK XVI.,Upon the Trojans; me ye freely blam’d;
12591,BOOK XVI.,"‘Ill-omen’d son of Peleus, sure in wrath"
12592,BOOK XVI.,"Thou wast conceiv’d, implacable, who here"
12593,BOOK XVI.,In idleness enforc’d thy comrades keep’st!
12594,BOOK XVI.,"’Twere better far our homeward way to take,"
12595,BOOK XVI.,If such pernicious rancour fill thy soul!’
12596,BOOK XVI.,Thus ye reproach’d me oft! Lo! now ye have
12597,BOOK XVI.,The great occasion which your souls desir’d!
12598,BOOK XVI.,"Then on, and with brave hearts the Trojans meet!”"
12599,BOOK XVI.,
12600,BOOK XVI.,"His words fresh courage rous’d in ev’ry breast,"
12601,BOOK XVI.,"And more compact, beneath their monarch’s eye,"
12602,BOOK XVI.,Their ranks were form’d; as when the builder lays
12603,BOOK XVI.,"The closely-fitting stones, to form the wall"
12604,BOOK XVI.,"Of some great house, and brave the winds of Heav’n;"
12605,BOOK XVI.,So close were fitted helm and bossy shield;
12606,BOOK XVI.,"Buckler on buckler press’d, and helm on helm,"
12607,BOOK XVI.,"And man on man; the horsehair plumes above,"
12608,BOOK XVI.,"That nodded, fearful, from the warriors’ brows,"
12609,BOOK XVI.,Each other touch’d; so closely mass’d they stood.
12610,BOOK XVI.,Before them all stood prominent in arms
12611,BOOK XVI.,"Two chiefs, Patroclus and Automedon,"
12612,BOOK XVI.,"Both with one thought possess’d, to lead the fight"
12613,BOOK XVI.,In the fore-front of all the Myrmidons.
12614,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles then within his tent withdrew,"
12615,BOOK XVI.,"And of a gorgeous coffer rais’d the lid,"
12616,BOOK XVI.,"Well-wrought, by silver-footed Thetis plac’d"
12617,BOOK XVI.,"On board his ship, and fill’d with rich attire,"
12618,BOOK XVI.,"With store of wind-proof cloaks, and carpets soft."
12619,BOOK XVI.,"There lay a goblet, richly chas’d, whence none,"
12620,BOOK XVI.,"But he alone, might drink the ruddy wine,"
12621,BOOK XVI.,Nor might libations thence to other Gods
12622,BOOK XVI.,"Be made, save only Jove: this brought he forth,"
12623,BOOK XVI.,"And first with sulphur purified, and next"
12624,BOOK XVI.,"Wash’d with pure water; then his hands he wash’d,"
12625,BOOK XVI.,And drew the ruddy wine; then standing forth
12626,BOOK XVI.,"Made in the centre of the court his pray’r,"
12627,BOOK XVI.,"And as he pour’d the wine, look’d up to Heav’n,"
12628,BOOK XVI.,"Not unbeheld of Jove, the lightning’s Lord:"
12629,BOOK XVI.,
12630,BOOK XVI.,"“Great King, Dodona’s Lord, Pelasgian Jove,"
12631,BOOK XVI.,"Who dwell’st on high, and rul’st with sov’reign sway"
12632,BOOK XVI.,Dodona’s wintry heights; where dwell around
12633,BOOK XVI.,"Thy Sellian priests, men of unwashen feet,"
12634,BOOK XVI.,That on the bare ground sleep; thou once before
12635,BOOK XVI.,"Hast heard my pray’r, and me with honour crown’d,"
12636,BOOK XVI.,And on the Greeks inflicted all thy plagues;
12637,BOOK XVI.,"Hear yet again, and this my boon accord."
12638,BOOK XVI.,I ’mid the throng of ships myself remain;
12639,BOOK XVI.,But with a num’rous force of Myrmidons
12640,BOOK XVI.,I send my comrade in my stead to fight:
12641,BOOK XVI.,"On him, all-seeing Jove, thy favour pour;"
12642,BOOK XVI.,"Strengthen his heart, that Hector’s self may learn"
12643,BOOK XVI.,"If, e’en alone, my follower knows to fight,"
12644,BOOK XVI.,"Or only then resistless pow’r displays,"
12645,BOOK XVI.,When I myself the toil of battle share.
12646,BOOK XVI.,"And from our vessels when the foe is driv’n,"
12647,BOOK XVI.,Grant that with all his arms and comrades true
12648,BOOK XVI.,He may in safety to the ships return.”
12649,BOOK XVI.,
12650,BOOK XVI.,"Thus pray’d he; Jove, the Lord of counsel, heard,"
12651,BOOK XVI.,"And half his pray’r he granted, half denied:"
12652,BOOK XVI.,For from the ships the battle to repel
12653,BOOK XVI.,He granted; but denied his safe return.
12654,BOOK XVI.,"His pray’rs and off’rings ended, to the tent"
12655,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles turn’d again, and in the chest"
12656,BOOK XVI.,"Replac’d the cup; then issuing forth, he stood"
12657,BOOK XVI.,Before the tent; for much he long’d to see
12658,BOOK XVI.,The Greeks and Trojans join in battle strife.
12659,BOOK XVI.,They who in arms round brave Patroclus stood
12660,BOOK XVI.,"Their line of battle form’d, with courage high"
12661,BOOK XVI.,To dash upon the Trojans; and as wasps
12662,BOOK XVI.,"That have their nest beside the public road,"
12663,BOOK XVI.,Which boys delight to vex and irritate
12664,BOOK XVI.,"In wanton play, but to the gen’ral harm;"
12665,BOOK XVI.,Them if some passing trav’ller unawares
12666,BOOK XVI.,"Disturb, with angry courage forth they rush"
12667,BOOK XVI.,"In one continuous swarm, to guard their nest:"
12668,BOOK XVI.,E’en with such courage pour’d the Myrmidons
12669,BOOK XVI.,"Forth from the ships; then uproar wild arose,"
12670,BOOK XVI.,And loud Patroclus on his comrades call’d:
12671,BOOK XVI.,
12672,BOOK XVI.,"“Ye valiant Myrmidons, who boast yourselves"
12673,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles’ comrades, quit ye now like men;"
12674,BOOK XVI.,"Your ancient valour prove; to Peleus’ son,"
12675,BOOK XVI.,"Of all the Greeks the noblest, so shall we,"
12676,BOOK XVI.,"His faithful followers, highest honour give;"
12677,BOOK XVI.,And Agamemnon’s haughty self shall mourn
12678,BOOK XVI.,The slight on Grecia’s bravest warrior cast.”
12679,BOOK XVI.,
12680,BOOK XVI.,His words fresh courage rous’d in ev’ry breast.
12681,BOOK XVI.,Thick on the Trojan host their masses fell;
12682,BOOK XVI.,While loud the fleet re-echoed to the sound
12683,BOOK XVI.,"Of Grecian cheers; but when the Trojans saw,"
12684,BOOK XVI.,"Blazing in arms, Menoetius’ godlike son,"
12685,BOOK XVI.,"Himself, and follower; quail’d the spirits of all;"
12686,BOOK XVI.,Their firm-set ranks were shaken; for they deem’d
12687,BOOK XVI.,Achilles had beside the ships exchang’d
12688,BOOK XVI.,His wrath for friendship; and each sev’ral man
12689,BOOK XVI.,"Look’d round, to find his own escape from death."
12690,BOOK XVI.,
12691,BOOK XVI.,Then first Patroclus aim’d his glitt’ring spear
12692,BOOK XVI.,"Amid the crowd, where thickest round the ships"
12693,BOOK XVI.,"Of brave Protesilaus, raged the war;"
12694,BOOK XVI.,"And struck Pyraechmes, who from Amydon,"
12695,BOOK XVI.,"From the wide-flowing stream of Axius, led"
12696,BOOK XVI.,The horsehair-crested Paeons; him he struck
12697,BOOK XVI.,Through the right shoulder; backwards in the dust
12698,BOOK XVI.,"Groaning, he fell; around him quail’d with fear"
12699,BOOK XVI.,"His Paeons all, such terror in their ranks"
12700,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus threw, their bravest leader slain,"
12701,BOOK XVI.,The foremost in the fight; the crowd he drove
12702,BOOK XVI.,"Far from the ships, and quench’d the blazing fire."
12703,BOOK XVI.,There lay the half-burnt ship; with shouts confus’d
12704,BOOK XVI.,The Trojans fled; and from amid the ships
12705,BOOK XVI.,Forth pour’d the Greeks; and loud the clamour rose.
12706,BOOK XVI.,
12707,BOOK XVI.,As when around a lofty mountain’s top
12708,BOOK XVI.,"The lightning’s Lord dispels a mass of cloud,"
12709,BOOK XVI.,"And ev’ry crag, and ev’ry jutting peak"
12710,BOOK XVI.,"Is plainly seen, and ev’ry forest glade;"
12711,BOOK XVI.,And the deep vault of Heav’n is open’d wide;
12712,BOOK XVI.,"So when the Greeks had clear’d the ships of fire,"
12713,BOOK XVI.,They breath’d awhile; yet ceas’d not so the strife;
12714,BOOK XVI.,For not in headlong panic from the ships
12715,BOOK XVI.,"The Trojans by the valiant Greeks were driv’n,"
12716,BOOK XVI.,"But, though perforce retiring, still made head."
12717,BOOK XVI.,
12718,BOOK XVI.,"Then of the chiefs, as wider spread the fight,"
12719,BOOK XVI.,Each singled each; Menoetius’ noble son
12720,BOOK XVI.,"First threw his pointed spear, and on the thigh"
12721,BOOK XVI.,"Struck Areilochus, in act to turn;"
12722,BOOK XVI.,Right through the point was driv’n; the weighty spear
12723,BOOK XVI.,"Shatter’d the bone, and prone to earth he fell."
12724,BOOK XVI.,The warlike Menelaus aim’d his spear
12725,BOOK XVI.,"Where Thoas’ breast, unguarded by his shield,"
12726,BOOK XVI.,Was left expos’d; and slack’d his limbs in death.
12727,BOOK XVI.,"Phyleus’ brave son, as rush’d Amphiclus on,"
12728,BOOK XVI.,"Stood firm, with eye observant; then th’ attack"
12729,BOOK XVI.,"Preventing, through his thigh, high up, where lie"
12730,BOOK XVI.,"The strongest muscles, smote; the weapon’s point"
12731,BOOK XVI.,Sever’d the tendons; darkness clos’d his eyes.
12732,BOOK XVI.,"Of Nestor’s sons, Antilochus, the first,"
12733,BOOK XVI.,"Atymnius wounded, driving through his flank"
12734,BOOK XVI.,He brazen spear; prone on his face he fell.
12735,BOOK XVI.,"Then, burning to avenge his brother’s death,"
12736,BOOK XVI.,"Stood Maris o’er the corpse, and hand to hand"
12737,BOOK XVI.,Engaged Antilochus; but ere a blow
12738,BOOK XVI.,"Was struck, the godlike Thrasymedes drove"
12739,BOOK XVI.,"Through his right shoulder, with unerring aim,"
12740,BOOK XVI.,His glitt’ring spear; the point his upper arm
12741,BOOK XVI.,"Tore from the muscles, shatt’ring all the bone:"
12742,BOOK XVI.,"Thund’ring he fell, and darkness clos’d his eyes."
12743,BOOK XVI.,"So to the shades, by those two brethren’s hands"
12744,BOOK XVI.,"Subdued, Sarpedon’s comrades brave were sent,"
12745,BOOK XVI.,"The sons of Amisodarus, who rear’d"
12746,BOOK XVI.,"The dread Chimaera, bane of mortal men."
12747,BOOK XVI.,"On Cleobulus, wounded in the press,"
12748,BOOK XVI.,"Ajax Oileus sprang, and captive took,"
12749,BOOK XVI.,Alive; but sudden on his neck let fall
12750,BOOK XVI.,"His hilted sword, and quench’d the fire of life."
12751,BOOK XVI.,The hot blood dyed the sword; the darkling shades
12752,BOOK XVI.,"Of death, and rig’rous fate, his eyes o’erspread."
12753,BOOK XVI.,"Then Peneleus and Lycon, hand to hand,"
12754,BOOK XVI.,"Engag’d in combat; both had miss’d their aim,"
12755,BOOK XVI.,And bootless hurl’d their weapons; then with swords
12756,BOOK XVI.,They met; first Lycon on the crested helm
12757,BOOK XVI.,Dealt a fierce blow; but in his hand the blade
12758,BOOK XVI.,Up to the hilt was shiver’d; then the sword
12759,BOOK XVI.,"Of Peneleus his neck, below the ear,"
12760,BOOK XVI.,Dissever’d; deeply in his throat the blade
12761,BOOK XVI.,"Was plung’d, and by the skin alone was stay’d;"
12762,BOOK XVI.,"Down droop’d his head, his limbs relax’d in death."
12763,BOOK XVI.,"Meriones by speed of foot o’ertook,"
12764,BOOK XVI.,"And, as his car he mounted, Acarnas"
12765,BOOK XVI.,Though the right shoulder pierc’d; down from the car
12766,BOOK XVI.,He fell; the shades of death his eyes o’erspread.
12767,BOOK XVI.,Full on the mouth of Erymas was thrust
12768,BOOK XVI.,"The weapon of Idomeneus; right through,"
12769,BOOK XVI.,"The white bones crashing, pass’d the brazen spear"
12770,BOOK XVI.,Below the brain; his teeth were shatter’d all;
12771,BOOK XVI.,"With blood, which with convulsive sobs he blew"
12772,BOOK XVI.,"From mouth and nostril, both his eyes were fill’d;"
12773,BOOK XVI.,And death’s dark cloud encompass’d him around.
12774,BOOK XVI.,Thus slew the Grecian leaders each his man.
12775,BOOK XVI.,
12776,BOOK XVI.,"As rav’ning wolves, that lambs or kids assail,"
12777,BOOK XVI.,"Stray’d from their dams, by careless shepherds left"
12778,BOOK XVI.,"Upon the mountain scatter’d; these they see,"
12779,BOOK XVI.,And tear at once their unresisting prey;
12780,BOOK XVI.,So on the Trojans fell the Greeks; in rout
12781,BOOK XVI.,"Disastrous they, unmann’d by terror, fled."
12782,BOOK XVI.,"Great Ajax still, unwearied, long’d to hurl"
12783,BOOK XVI.,His spear at Hector of the brazen helm;
12784,BOOK XVI.,"But he, well skill’d in war, his shoulders broad"
12785,BOOK XVI.,"Protected by his shield of tough bull’s hide,"
12786,BOOK XVI.,"Watch’d for the whizzing shafts, and jav’lins’ whirr."
12787,BOOK XVI.,"Full well he knew the tide of battle turn’d,"
12788,BOOK XVI.,"Yet held his ground, his trusty friends to save."
12789,BOOK XVI.,
12790,BOOK XVI.,"As from Olympus, o’er the clear blue sky"
12791,BOOK XVI.,"Pour the dark clouds, when Jove the vault of Heav’n"
12792,BOOK XVI.,"O’erspreads with storm and tempest, from the ships"
12793,BOOK XVI.,"So pour’d with panic cries the flying host,"
12794,BOOK XVI.,And in disorder’d rout recross’d the trench.
12795,BOOK XVI.,Then Hector’s flying coursers bore him safe
12796,BOOK XVI.,"Far from the struggling masses, whom the ditch"
12797,BOOK XVI.,Detain’d perforce; there many a royal car
12798,BOOK XVI.,With broken pole th’ unharness’d horses left.
12799,BOOK XVI.,"On, shouting to the Greeks, Patroclus press’d"
12800,BOOK XVI.,"The flying Trojans; they, with panic cries,"
12801,BOOK XVI.,"Dispers’d, the roads encumber’d; high uprose"
12802,BOOK XVI.,"The storms of dust, as from the tents and ships"
12803,BOOK XVI.,Back to the city stretch’d the flying steeds;
12804,BOOK XVI.,And ever where the densest throng appear’d
12805,BOOK XVI.,With furious threats Patroclus urg’d his course;
12806,BOOK XVI.,His glowing axle trac’d by prostrate men
12807,BOOK XVI.,"Hurl’d from their cars, and chariots overthrown."
12808,BOOK XVI.,"Flew o’er the deep-sunk trench th’ immortal steeds,"
12809,BOOK XVI.,"The noble prize the Gods to Peleus gave,"
12810,BOOK XVI.,"Still onward straining; for he long’d to reach,"
12811,BOOK XVI.,And hurl his spear at Hector; him meanwhile
12812,BOOK XVI.,His flying steeds in safety bore away.
12813,BOOK XVI.,
12814,BOOK XVI.,"As in th’ autumnal season, when the earth"
12815,BOOK XVI.,With weight of rain is saturate; when Jove
12816,BOOK XVI.,"Pours down his fiercest storms in wrath to men,"
12817,BOOK XVI.,"Who in their courts unrighteous judgments pass,"
12818,BOOK XVI.,"And justice yield to lawless violence,"
12819,BOOK XVI.,The wrath of Heav’n despising; ev’ry stream
12820,BOOK XVI.,Is brimming o’er: the hills in gullies deep
12821,BOOK XVI.,"Are by the torrents seam’d, which, rushing down"
12822,BOOK XVI.,"From the high mountains to the dark-blue sea,"
12823,BOOK XVI.,"With groans and tumult urge their headlong course,"
12824,BOOK XVI.,"Wasting the works of man; so urg’d their flight,"
12825,BOOK XVI.,"So, as they fled, the Trojan horses groan’d."
12826,BOOK XVI.,"The foremost ranks cut off, back tow’rd the ships"
12827,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus drove them, baffling their attempts"
12828,BOOK XVI.,To gain the city; and in middle space
12829,BOOK XVI.,"Between the ships, the stream, and lofty wall,"
12830,BOOK XVI.,"Dealt slaughter round him, and of many a chief"
12831,BOOK XVI.,The bitter penalty of death requir’d.
12832,BOOK XVI.,"Then Pronous with his glitt’ring spear he struck,"
12833,BOOK XVI.,"Where by the shield his breast was left expos’d,"
12834,BOOK XVI.,And slack’d his limbs in death; thund’ring he fell.
12835,BOOK XVI.,"Next Thestor, son of Œnops, he assail’d;"
12836,BOOK XVI.,"He on his polish’d car, down-crouching, sat,"
12837,BOOK XVI.,His mind by fear disorder’d; from his hands
12838,BOOK XVI.,"The reins had dropp’d; him, thrusting with the spear,"
12839,BOOK XVI.,"Through the right cheek and through the teeth he smote,"
12840,BOOK XVI.,"Then dragg’d him, by the weapon, o’er the rail."
12841,BOOK XVI.,As when an angler on a prominent rock
12842,BOOK XVI.,Drags from the sea to shore with hook and line
12843,BOOK XVI.,"A weighty fish; so him Patroclus dragg’d,"
12844,BOOK XVI.,"Gaping, from off the car; and dash’d him down"
12845,BOOK XVI.,Upon his face; and life forsook his limbs.
12846,BOOK XVI.,"Next Eryalus, eager for the fray,"
12847,BOOK XVI.,On the mid forehead with a mighty stone
12848,BOOK XVI.,He struck; beneath the pond’rous helmet’s weight
12849,BOOK XVI.,"The skull was split in twain; prostrate he fell,"
12850,BOOK XVI.,By life-consuming death encompass’d round.
12851,BOOK XVI.,"Forthwith Amphoterus, and Erymas,"
12852,BOOK XVI.,"Epaltes, Echius, and Tlepolemus,"
12853,BOOK XVI.,"Son of Damastor, Pyris, Ipheus brave,"
12854,BOOK XVI.,"Euippus, Polymelus, Argeas’ son,"
12855,BOOK XVI.,In quick succession to the ground he brought.
12856,BOOK XVI.,Sarpedon his ungirdled forces saw
12857,BOOK XVI.,"Promiscuous fall before Menoetius’ son,"
12858,BOOK XVI.,And to the Lycians call’d in loud reproof:
12859,BOOK XVI.,"“Shame, Lycians! whither fly ye? why this haste?"
12860,BOOK XVI.,"I will myself this chief confront, and learn"
12861,BOOK XVI.,"Who this may be of bearing proud and high,"
12862,BOOK XVI.,"Who on the Trojans grievous harm hath wrought,"
12863,BOOK XVI.,And many a warrior’s limbs relax’d in death.”
12864,BOOK XVI.,
12865,BOOK XVI.,"He said, and from his car, accoutred, sprang;"
12866,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus saw, and he too leap’d to earth."
12867,BOOK XVI.,"As on a lofty rock, with angry screams,"
12868,BOOK XVI.,"Hook-beak’d, with talons curv’d, two vultures fight;"
12869,BOOK XVI.,So with loud shouts these two to battle rush’d.
12870,BOOK XVI.,"The son of Saturn pitying saw, and thus"
12871,BOOK XVI.,"To Juno spoke, his sister and his wife:"
12872,BOOK XVI.,
12873,BOOK XVI.,"“Woe, woe! that fate decrees my best-belov’d,"
12874,BOOK XVI.,"Sarpedon, by Patroclus’ hand to fall;"
12875,BOOK XVI.,"E’en now conflicting thoughts my soul divide,"
12876,BOOK XVI.,"To bear him from the fatal strife unhurt,"
12877,BOOK XVI.,"And set him down on Lycia’s fertile plains,"
12878,BOOK XVI.,Or leave him by Patroclus’ hand to fall.”
12879,BOOK XVI.,
12880,BOOK XVI.,"Whom, answer’d thus the stag-ey’d Queen of Heav’n:"
12881,BOOK XVI.,"“What words, dread son of Saturn, dost thou speak?"
12882,BOOK XVI.,Wouldst thou a mortal man from death withdraw
12883,BOOK XVI.,Long since by fate decreed? Do what thou wilt;
12884,BOOK XVI.,"Yet cannot we, the rest, applaud thine act."
12885,BOOK XVI.,"This too I say, and turn it in thy mind:"
12886,BOOK XVI.,If to his home Sarpedon thou restore
12887,BOOK XVI.,"Alive, bethink thee, will not other Gods"
12888,BOOK XVI.,Their sons too from the stubborn fight withdraw?
12889,BOOK XVI.,For in the field around the walls of Troy
12890,BOOK XVI.,"Are many sons of Gods, in all of whom"
12891,BOOK XVI.,This act of thine will angry feelings rouse.
12892,BOOK XVI.,"But if thou love him, and thy soul deplore"
12893,BOOK XVI.,"His coming doom, yet in the stubborn fight"
12894,BOOK XVI.,Leave him beneath Patroclus’ hand to fall:
12895,BOOK XVI.,"Then, when his spirit hath fled, the charge assign"
12896,BOOK XVI.,"To Death and gentle Sleep, that in their arms"
12897,BOOK XVI.,They bear him safe to Lycia’s wide-spread plains:
12898,BOOK XVI.,There shall his brethren and his friends perform
12899,BOOK XVI.,"His fun’ral rites, and mound and column raise,"
12900,BOOK XVI.,The fitting tribute to the mighty dead.”
12901,BOOK XVI.,
12902,BOOK XVI.,Thus she; the Sire of Gods and men complied:
12903,BOOK XVI.,"But to the ground some drops of blood let fall,"
12904,BOOK XVI.,"In honour of his son, whom fate decreed,"
12905,BOOK XVI.,"Far from his country, on the fertile plains"
12906,BOOK XVI.,Of Troy to perish by Patroclus’ hand.
12907,BOOK XVI.,"As near the champions drew, Patroclus first"
12908,BOOK XVI.,"His weapon hurl’d, and Thrasymedes brave,"
12909,BOOK XVI.,"The faithful follower of Sarpedon, struck"
12910,BOOK XVI.,"Below the waist, and slack’d his limbs in death."
12911,BOOK XVI.,"Thrown in his turn, Sarpedon’s glitt’ring spear"
12912,BOOK XVI.,"Flew wide; and Pedasus, the gallant horse,"
12913,BOOK XVI.,Through the right shoulder wounded; with a scream
12914,BOOK XVI.,"He fell, and in the dust breath’d forth his life,"
12915,BOOK XVI.,"As, shrieking loud, his noble spirit fled."
12916,BOOK XVI.,This way and that his two companions swerv’d;
12917,BOOK XVI.,"Creak’d the strong yoke, and tangled were the reins,"
12918,BOOK XVI.,As in the dust the prostrate courser lay.
12919,BOOK XVI.,Automedon the means of safety saw;
12920,BOOK XVI.,And drawing from beside his brawny thigh
12921,BOOK XVI.,"His keen-edg’d sword, with no uncertain blow"
12922,BOOK XVI.,"Cut loose the fallen horse; again set straight,"
12923,BOOK XVI.,"The two, extended, stretch’d the tightened rein."
12924,BOOK XVI.,Again in mortal strife the warriors clos’d:
12925,BOOK XVI.,Once more Sarpedon hurl’d his glitt’ring spear
12926,BOOK XVI.,In vain; above Patroclus’ shoulder flew
12927,BOOK XVI.,"The point, innocuous; from his hand in turn"
12928,BOOK XVI.,"The spear not vainly thrown, Sarpedon struck"
12929,BOOK XVI.,"Where lies the diaphragm, below the heart."
12930,BOOK XVI.,"He fell; as falls an oak, or poplar tall,"
12931,BOOK XVI.,"Or lofty pine, which on the mountain top"
12932,BOOK XVI.,For some proud ship the woodman’s axe hath hewn:
12933,BOOK XVI.,"So he, with death-cry sharp, before his car"
12934,BOOK XVI.,"Extended lay, and clutch’d the blood-stain’d soil."
12935,BOOK XVI.,"As when a lion on the herd has sprung,"
12936,BOOK XVI.,"And, ’mid the heifers seiz’d, the lordly bull"
12937,BOOK XVI.,"Lies bellowing, crush’d between the lion’s jaws;"
12938,BOOK XVI.,"So by Patroclus slain, the Lycian chief,"
12939,BOOK XVI.,"Undaunted still, his faithful comrade call’d:"
12940,BOOK XVI.,"“Good Glaucus, warrior tried, behoves thee now"
12941,BOOK XVI.,"Thy spearmanship to prove, and warlike might."
12942,BOOK XVI.,Welcome the fray; put forth thine utmost speed;
12943,BOOK XVI.,"Call on the Lycian chiefs, on ev’ry side,"
12944,BOOK XVI.,"To press around, and for Sarpedon fight;"
12945,BOOK XVI.,Thou too thine arms for my protection wield;
12946,BOOK XVI.,"For I to thee, through all thy future days,"
12947,BOOK XVI.,"Shall be a ceaseless scandal and reproach,"
12948,BOOK XVI.,"If me, thus slain before the Grecian ships,"
12949,BOOK XVI.,The Greeks be suffer’d of my arms to spoil:
12950,BOOK XVI.,"But stand thou fast, and others’ courage raise.”"
12951,BOOK XVI.,
12952,BOOK XVI.,"Thus as he spoke, the shades of death o’erspread"
12953,BOOK XVI.,His eyes and nostrils; then with foot firm-set
12954,BOOK XVI.,"Upon his chest, Patroclus from the corpse"
12955,BOOK XVI.,"Drew, by main force, the fast-adhering spear;"
12956,BOOK XVI.,The life forth issuing with the weapon’s point.
12957,BOOK XVI.,"Loos’d from the royal car, the snorting steeds,"
12958,BOOK XVI.,"Eager for flight, the Myrmidons detain’d."
12959,BOOK XVI.,"Deep-grieving, Glaucus heard his voice: and chafed"
12960,BOOK XVI.,"His spirit within him, that he lacked the power"
12961,BOOK XVI.,To aid his comrade; with his hand he grasp’d
12962,BOOK XVI.,"His wounded arm, in torture from the shaft"
12963,BOOK XVI.,"By Teucer shot, to save the Greeks from death,"
12964,BOOK XVI.,As on he pressed to scale the lofty wall:
12965,BOOK XVI.,Then to Apollo thus address’d his pray’r:
12966,BOOK XVI.,
12967,BOOK XVI.,"“Hear me, great King, who, as on Lycia’s plains,"
12968,BOOK XVI.,Art here in Troy; and hear’st in ev’ry place
12969,BOOK XVI.,"Their voice who suffer, as I suffer now."
12970,BOOK XVI.,"A grievous wound I bear, and sharpest pangs"
12971,BOOK XVI.,"My arm assail, nor may the blood he stanch’d:"
12972,BOOK XVI.,The pain weighs down my shoulder; and my hand
12973,BOOK XVI.,"Hath lost its pow’r to fight, or grasp my spear."
12974,BOOK XVI.,"Sarpedon, bravest of the brave, is slain,"
12975,BOOK XVI.,The son of Jove; yet Jove preserv’d him not.
12976,BOOK XVI.,"But thou, O King, this grievous wound relieve;"
12977,BOOK XVI.,"Assuage the pain, and give me strength to urge"
12978,BOOK XVI.,"My Lycian comrades to maintain the war,"
12979,BOOK XVI.,And fight myself to guard the noble dead.”
12980,BOOK XVI.,
12981,BOOK XVI.,"Thus as he pray’d, his pray’r Apollo heard,"
12982,BOOK XVI.,"Assuag’d his pains, and from the grievous wound"
12983,BOOK XVI.,"Stanch’ d the dark blood, and fill’d his soul with strength."
12984,BOOK XVI.,"Glaucus within himself perceiv’d, and knew,"
12985,BOOK XVI.,"Rejoicing, that the God had heard his pray’r."
12986,BOOK XVI.,The Lycian leaders first on ev’ry side
12987,BOOK XVI.,He urg’d to hasten for their King to fight:
12988,BOOK XVI.,"Then ’mid the Trojans went with lofty step,"
12989,BOOK XVI.,"And first to Panthous’ son, Polydamas,"
12990,BOOK XVI.,To brave Agenor and Æneas next;
12991,BOOK XVI.,Then Hector of the brazen helm himself
12992,BOOK XVI.,"Approaching, thus with winged words address’d:"
12993,BOOK XVI.,
12994,BOOK XVI.,"“Hector, forgett’st thou quite thy brave allies,"
12995,BOOK XVI.,"Who freely in thy cause pour forth their lives,"
12996,BOOK XVI.,Far from their home and friends? but they from thee
12997,BOOK XVI.,"No aid receive; Sarpedon lies in death,"
12998,BOOK XVI.,"The leader of the buckler’d Lycian bands,"
12999,BOOK XVI.,Whose justice and whose pow’r were Lycia’s shield;
13000,BOOK XVI.,Him by Patroclus’ hand hath Mars subdued.
13001,BOOK XVI.,"But, friends, stand by me now! with just revenge"
13002,BOOK XVI.,"Inspir’d, determine that the Myrmidons"
13003,BOOK XVI.,"Shall not, how griev’d soe’er for all the Greeks"
13004,BOOK XVI.,"Who by our spears beside the ships have fall’n,"
13005,BOOK XVI.,"Our dead dishonour, and his arms obtain.”"
13006,BOOK XVI.,
13007,BOOK XVI.,He said; and through the Trojans thrill’d the sense
13008,BOOK XVI.,"Of grief intolerable, unrestrain’d;"
13009,BOOK XVI.,"For he, though stranger-born, was of the State"
13010,BOOK XVI.,A mighty pillar; and his followers
13011,BOOK XVI.,A num’rous host; and he himself in fight
13012,BOOK XVI.,"Among the foremost; so, against the Greeks,"
13013,BOOK XVI.,"With fiery zeal they rush’d, by Hector led,"
13014,BOOK XVI.,Griev’d for Sarpedon’s loss; on th’ other side
13015,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus’ manly heart the Greeks arous’d,"
13016,BOOK XVI.,"And to th’ Ajaces first, themselves inflamed"
13017,BOOK XVI.,"With warlike zeal, he thus address’d his speech:"
13018,BOOK XVI.,
13019,BOOK XVI.,"“Ye sons of Ajax, now is come the time"
13020,BOOK XVI.,"Your former fame to rival, or surpass:"
13021,BOOK XVI.,"The man hath fall’n, who first o’erleap’d our wall,"
13022,BOOK XVI.,"Sarpedon; now remains, that, having slain,"
13023,BOOK XVI.,"We should his corpse dishonour, and his arms"
13024,BOOK XVI.,Strip off; and should some comrade dare attempt
13025,BOOK XVI.,"His rescue, him too with our spears subdue.”"
13026,BOOK XVI.,
13027,BOOK XVI.,"He said; and they, with martial ardour fir’d,"
13028,BOOK XVI.,Rush’d to the conflict. When on either side
13029,BOOK XVI.,"The reinforc’d battalions were array’d,"
13030,BOOK XVI.,"Trojans and Lycians, Myrmidons and Greeks"
13031,BOOK XVI.,"Around the dead in sternest combat met,"
13032,BOOK XVI.,With fearful shouts; and loud their armour rang.
13033,BOOK XVI.,"Then, to enhance the horror of the strife"
13034,BOOK XVI.,"Around his son, with darkness Jove o’erspread"
13035,BOOK XVI.,The stubborn fight: the Trojans first drove back
13036,BOOK XVI.,"The keen-ey’d Greeks; for first a warrior fell,"
13037,BOOK XVI.,"Not of the meanest ’mid the Myrmidons,"
13038,BOOK XVI.,"Epegeus, son of valiant Agacles;"
13039,BOOK XVI.,Who in Budaeum’s thriving state bore rule
13040,BOOK XVI.,"Erewhile; but flying for a kinsman slain,"
13041,BOOK XVI.,To Peleus and the silver-footed Queen
13042,BOOK XVI.,He came a suppliant; with Achilles thence
13043,BOOK XVI.,"To Ilium sent, to join the war of Troy."
13044,BOOK XVI.,"Him, as he stretch’d his hand to seize the dead,"
13045,BOOK XVI.,Full on the forehead with a massive stone
13046,BOOK XVI.,Great Hector smote; within the pond’rous helm
13047,BOOK XVI.,The skull was split in twain; prone on the corpse
13048,BOOK XVI.,"He fell, by life-destroying death subdued."
13049,BOOK XVI.,Griev’d was Patroclus for his comrade slain;
13050,BOOK XVI.,"Forward he darted, as a swift-wing’d hawk,"
13051,BOOK XVI.,That swoops amid the starlings and the daws;
13052,BOOK XVI.,"So swift didst thou, Patroclus, car-borne chief,"
13053,BOOK XVI.,"Upon the Trojans and the Lycians spring,"
13054,BOOK XVI.,Thy soul with anger for thy comrade fill’d.
13055,BOOK XVI.,"A pond’rous stone he hurl’d at Sthenelas,"
13056,BOOK XVI.,Son of Ithaemenes; the mighty mass
13057,BOOK XVI.,"Fell on his neck, and all the muscles crush’d."
13058,BOOK XVI.,Back drew great Hector and the chiefs of Troy;
13059,BOOK XVI.,"Far as a jav’lin’s flight, in sportive strife,"
13060,BOOK XVI.,"Or in the deadly battle, hurl’d by one"
13061,BOOK XVI.,His utmost strength exerting; back so far
13062,BOOK XVI.,"The Trojans drew, so far the Greeks pursued."
13063,BOOK XVI.,"Glaucus, the leader of the Lycian spears,"
13064,BOOK XVI.,"First turning, slew the mighty Bathycles,"
13065,BOOK XVI.,"The son of Chalcon; he in Hellas dwelt,"
13066,BOOK XVI.,In wealth surpassing all the Myrmidons.
13067,BOOK XVI.,"Him, as he gain’d upon him in pursuit,"
13068,BOOK XVI.,"Quick turning, Glaucus through the breast transfix’d;"
13069,BOOK XVI.,Thund’ring he fell; deep grief possess’d the Greeks
13070,BOOK XVI.,At loss of one so valiant; fiercely joy’d
13071,BOOK XVI.,"The Trojans, and around him crowded thick;"
13072,BOOK XVI.,Nor of their wonted valour were the Greeks
13073,BOOK XVI.,"Oblivious, but still onward held their course."
13074,BOOK XVI.,"Then slew Meriones a crested chief,"
13075,BOOK XVI.,"The bold Laogonus, Onetor’s son;"
13076,BOOK XVI.,"Onetor, of Idaean Jove the priest,"
13077,BOOK XVI.,And by the people as a God rever’d.
13078,BOOK XVI.,Below the ear he struck him; from his limbs
13079,BOOK XVI.,"The spirit fled, and darkness veil’d his eyes."
13080,BOOK XVI.,
13081,BOOK XVI.,Then at Meriones Æneas threw
13082,BOOK XVI.,"His brazen spear, in hopes beneath his shield"
13083,BOOK XVI.,"To find a spot unguarded; he beheld,"
13084,BOOK XVI.,"And downward stooping, shunn’d the brazen death;"
13085,BOOK XVI.,"Behind him far, deep in the soil infix’d,"
13086,BOOK XVI.,The weapon stood; there Mars its impulse stay’d;
13087,BOOK XVI.,"So, bootless hurl’d, though by no feeble hand,"
13088,BOOK XVI.,Æneas’ spear stood quiv’ring in the ground;
13089,BOOK XVI.,"Then thus in wrath he cried: “Meriones,"
13090,BOOK XVI.,"Had it but struck thee, nimble as thou art,"
13091,BOOK XVI.,My spear had brought thy dancing to a close.”
13092,BOOK XVI.,
13093,BOOK XVI.,"To whom the spearman skill’d, Meriones:"
13094,BOOK XVI.,"“Brave as thou art, Æneas, ’tis too much"
13095,BOOK XVI.,"For thee to hope the might of all to quell,"
13096,BOOK XVI.,Who dare confront thee; thou art mortal too!
13097,BOOK XVI.,"And if my aim be true, and should my spear"
13098,BOOK XVI.,"But strike thee fair, all valiant as thou art,"
13099,BOOK XVI.,"And confident, yet me thy fall shall crown"
13100,BOOK XVI.,"With triumph, and thy soul to Hades send.”"
13101,BOOK XVI.,
13102,BOOK XVI.,He said; and him Menoetius’ noble son
13103,BOOK XVI.,"Address’d with grave rebuke: “Meriones,"
13104,BOOK XVI.,"Brave warrior, why thus waste the time in words?"
13105,BOOK XVI.,"Trust me, good friend, ’tis not by vaunting speech,"
13106,BOOK XVI.,"Unseconded by deeds, that we may hope"
13107,BOOK XVI.,To scare away the Trojans from the slain:
13108,BOOK XVI.,"Hands are for battle, words for council meet;"
13109,BOOK XVI.,"Boots it not now to wrangle, but to fight.”"
13110,BOOK XVI.,
13111,BOOK XVI.,"He said, and led the way; him follow’d straight"
13112,BOOK XVI.,"The godlike chief; forthwith, as loudly rings,"
13113,BOOK XVI.,"Amid the mountain forest’s deep recess,"
13114,BOOK XVI.,"The woodman’s axe, and far is heard the sound;"
13115,BOOK XVI.,"So from the wide-spread earth their clamour rose,"
13116,BOOK XVI.,"As brazen arms, and shields, and tough bull’s-hide"
13117,BOOK XVI.,Encounter’d swords and double-pointed spears.
13118,BOOK XVI.,"Nor might the sharpest sight Sarpedon know,"
13119,BOOK XVI.,From head to foot with wounds and blood and dust
13120,BOOK XVI.,Disfigur’d; thickly round the dead they swarm’d.
13121,BOOK XVI.,As when at spring-tide in the cattle-sheds
13122,BOOK XVI.,"Around the milk-cans swarm the buzzing flies,"
13123,BOOK XVI.,While the warm milk is frothing in the pail;
13124,BOOK XVI.,So swarm’d they round the dead; nor Jove the while
13125,BOOK XVI.,Turn’d from the stubborn fight his piercing glance;
13126,BOOK XVI.,"But still look’d down with gaze intent, and mus’d"
13127,BOOK XVI.,"Upon Patroclus’ coming fate, in doubt,"
13128,BOOK XVI.,"If he too there beside Sarpedon slain,"
13129,BOOK XVI.,"Should perish by illustrious Hector’s hand,"
13130,BOOK XVI.,Spoil’d of his arms; or yet be spared awhile
13131,BOOK XVI.,To swell the labours of the battle-field.
13132,BOOK XVI.,"He judg’d it best at length, that once again"
13133,BOOK XVI.,The gallant follower of Peleus’ son
13134,BOOK XVI.,Should tow’rd the town with fearful slaughter drive
13135,BOOK XVI.,"The Trojans, and their brazen-helmed chief."
13136,BOOK XVI.,First Hector’s soul with panic fear he fill’d;
13137,BOOK XVI.,"Mounting his car, he fled, and urg’d to flight"
13138,BOOK XVI.,The Trojans; for he saw the scales of Jove.
13139,BOOK XVI.,Then nor the valiant Lycians held their ground;
13140,BOOK XVI.,"All fled in terror, as they saw their King"
13141,BOOK XVI.,"Pierc’d through the heart, amid a pile of dead;"
13142,BOOK XVI.,"For o’er his body many a warrior fell,"
13143,BOOK XVI.,When Saturn’s son the conflict fierce inflam’d.
13144,BOOK XVI.,"Then from Sarpedon’s breast they stripp’d his arms,"
13145,BOOK XVI.,Of brass refulgent; these Menoetius’ son
13146,BOOK XVI.,Sent by his comrades to the ships of Greece.
13147,BOOK XVI.,
13148,BOOK XVI.,To Phoebus then the Cloud-compeller thus:
13149,BOOK XVI.,"“Hie thee, good Phoebus, from amid the spears"
13150,BOOK XVI.,"Withdraw Sarpedon, and from all his wounds"
13151,BOOK XVI.,"Cleanse the dark gore; then bear him far away,"
13152,BOOK XVI.,And lave his body in the flowing stream;
13153,BOOK XVI.,Then with divine ambrosia all his limbs
13154,BOOK XVI.,"Anointing, clothe him in immortal robes."
13155,BOOK XVI.,"To two swift bearers give him then in charge,"
13156,BOOK XVI.,"To Sleep and Death, twin brothers, in their arms"
13157,BOOK XVI.,To bear him safe to Lycia’s wide-spread plains:
13158,BOOK XVI.,There shall his brethren and his friends perform
13159,BOOK XVI.,"His fun’ral rites, and mound and column raise,"
13160,BOOK XVI.,The fitting tribute to the mighty dead.”
13161,BOOK XVI.,
13162,BOOK XVI.,"He said; obedient to his father’s words,"
13163,BOOK XVI.,Down to the battle-field Apollo sped
13164,BOOK XVI.,From Ida’s height; and from amid the spears
13165,BOOK XVI.,"Withdrawn, he bore Sarpedon far away,"
13166,BOOK XVI.,And lav’d his body in the flowing stream;
13167,BOOK XVI.,Then with divine ambrosia all his limbs
13168,BOOK XVI.,"Anointing, cloth’d him in immortal robes;"
13169,BOOK XVI.,"To two swift bearers gave him then in charge,"
13170,BOOK XVI.,"To Sleep and Death, twin brothers; in their arms"
13171,BOOK XVI.,They bore him safe to Lycia’s wide-spread plains.
13172,BOOK XVI.,
13173,BOOK XVI.,Then to Automedon Patroclus gave
13174,BOOK XVI.,"His orders, and the flying foe pursued."
13175,BOOK XVI.,"Oh much deceiv’d, insensate! had he now"
13176,BOOK XVI.,"But borne in mind the words of Peleus’ son,"
13177,BOOK XVI.,He might have ’scap’d the bitter doom of death.
13178,BOOK XVI.,But still Jove’s will the will of man o’errules:
13179,BOOK XVI.,"Who strikes with panic, and of vict’ry robs"
13180,BOOK XVI.,The bravest; and anon excites to war;
13181,BOOK XVI.,Who now Patroclus’ breast with fury fill’d.
13182,BOOK XVI.,"Whom then, Patroclus, first, whom slew’st thou last,"
13183,BOOK XVI.,When summon’d by the Gods to meet thy doom?
13184,BOOK XVI.,"Adrastus, and Autonous, Perimus"
13185,BOOK XVI.,"The son of Meges, and Echeclus next;"
13186,BOOK XVI.,"Epistor, Melanippus, Elasus,"
13187,BOOK XVI.,"And Mulius, and Pylartes; these he slew;"
13188,BOOK XVI.,The others all in flight their safety found.
13189,BOOK XVI.,
13190,BOOK XVI.,Then had the Greeks the lofty-gated town
13191,BOOK XVI.,"Of Priam captur’d by Patroclus’ hand,"
13192,BOOK XVI.,So forward and so fierce he bore his spear;
13193,BOOK XVI.,"But on the well-built tow’r Apollo stood,"
13194,BOOK XVI.,"On his destruction bent, and Troy’s defence"
13195,BOOK XVI.,The jutting angle of the lofty wall
13196,BOOK XVI.,Patroclus thrice assail’d; his onset thrice
13197,BOOK XVI.,"Apollo, with his own immortal hands"
13198,BOOK XVI.,"Repelling, backward thrust his glitt’ring shield."
13199,BOOK XVI.,"But when again, with more than mortal force"
13200,BOOK XVI.,"He made his fourth attempt, with awful mien"
13201,BOOK XVI.,And threat’ning voice the Far-destroyer spoke:
13202,BOOK XVI.,
13203,BOOK XVI.,"“Back, Heav’n-born chief, Patroclus! not to thee"
13204,BOOK XVI.,Hath fate decreed the triumph to destroy
13205,BOOK XVI.,"The warlike Trojans’ city; no, nor yet"
13206,BOOK XVI.,"To great Achilles, mightier far than thou.”"
13207,BOOK XVI.,
13208,BOOK XVI.,"Thus as he spoke, Patroclus backward stepp’d,"
13209,BOOK XVI.,Shrinking before the Far-destroyer’s wrath.
13210,BOOK XVI.,Still Hector kept before the Scaean gates
13211,BOOK XVI.,"His coursers; doubtful, if again to dare"
13212,BOOK XVI.,"The battle-throng, or summon all the host"
13213,BOOK XVI.,To seek the friendly shelter of the wall.
13214,BOOK XVI.,"Thus as he mus’d, beside him Phoebus stood,"
13215,BOOK XVI.,"In likeness of a warrior stout and brave,"
13216,BOOK XVI.,"Brother of Hecuba, the uncle thence"
13217,BOOK XVI.,"Of noble Hector, Asius, Dymas’ son;"
13218,BOOK XVI.,"Who dwelt in Phrygia, by Saugarius’ stream;"
13219,BOOK XVI.,"His form assuming, thus Apollo spoke:"
13220,BOOK XVI.,"“Hector, why shrink’st thou from the battle thus?"
13221,BOOK XVI.,It ill beseems thee! Would to Heav’n that I
13222,BOOK XVI.,"So far thy greater were, as thou art mine;"
13223,BOOK XVI.,Then sorely shouldst thou rue this abstinence.
13224,BOOK XVI.,"But, forward thou! against Patroclus urge"
13225,BOOK XVI.,"Thy fiery steeds, so haply by his death"
13226,BOOK XVI.,Apollo thee with endless fame may crown.”
13227,BOOK XVI.,
13228,BOOK XVI.,"This said, the God rejoin’d the strife of men;"
13229,BOOK XVI.,And noble Hector bade Cebriones
13230,BOOK XVI.,Drive ’mid the fight his car; before him mov’d
13231,BOOK XVI.,"Apollo, scatt’ring terror ’mid the Greeks,"
13232,BOOK XVI.,And lustre adding to the arms of Troy.
13233,BOOK XVI.,"All others Hector pass’d unnotic’d by,"
13234,BOOK XVI.,Nor stay’d to slay; Patroclus was the mark
13235,BOOK XVI.,At which his coursers’ clatt’ring hoofs he drove.
13236,BOOK XVI.,"On th’ other side, Patroclus from his car"
13237,BOOK XVI.,Leap’d to the ground: his left hand held his spear;
13238,BOOK XVI.,And in the right a pond’rous mass he bore
13239,BOOK XVI.,"Of rugged stone, that fill’d his ample grasp:"
13240,BOOK XVI.,"The stone he hurl’d; not far it miss’d its mark,"
13241,BOOK XVI.,Nor bootless flew; but Hector’s charioteer
13242,BOOK XVI.,"It struck, Cebriones, a bastard son"
13243,BOOK XVI.,"Of royal Priam, as the reins he held."
13244,BOOK XVI.,"Full on his temples fell the jagged mass,"
13245,BOOK XVI.,"Drove both his eyebrows in, and crush’d the bone;"
13246,BOOK XVI.,Before him in the dust his eyeballs fell;
13247,BOOK XVI.,"And, like a diver, from the well-wrought car"
13248,BOOK XVI.,Headlong he plung’d; and life forsook his limbs.
13249,BOOK XVI.,O’er whom Patroclus thus with bitter jest:
13250,BOOK XVI.,“Heav’n! what agility! how deftly thrown
13251,BOOK XVI.,That somersault! if only in the sea
13252,BOOK XVI.,"Such feats he wrought, with him might few compete,"
13253,BOOK XVI.,"Diving for oysters, if with such a plunge"
13254,BOOK XVI.,"He left his boat, how rough soe’er the waves,"
13255,BOOK XVI.,As from his car he plunges to the ground:
13256,BOOK XVI.,"Troy can, it seems, accomplish’d tumblers boast.”"
13257,BOOK XVI.,
13258,BOOK XVI.,"Thus saying, on Cebriones he sprang,"
13259,BOOK XVI.,"As springs a lion, through the breast transfix’d,"
13260,BOOK XVI.,"In act the sheepfold to despoil, and dies"
13261,BOOK XVI.,The victim of his courage; so didst thou
13262,BOOK XVI.,"Upon Cebriones, Patroclus, spring."
13263,BOOK XVI.,Down from his car too Hector leap’d to earth.
13264,BOOK XVI.,"So, o’er Cebriones, oppos’d they stood;"
13265,BOOK XVI.,"As on the mountain, o’er a slaughter’d stag,"
13266,BOOK XVI.,"Both hunger-pinch’d, two lions fiercely fight,"
13267,BOOK XVI.,"So o’er Cebriones two mighty chiefs,"
13268,BOOK XVI.,"Menoetius’ son and noble Hector, strove,"
13269,BOOK XVI.,Each in the other bent to plunge his spear.
13270,BOOK XVI.,"The head, with grasp unyielding, Hector held;"
13271,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus seiz’d the foot; and, crowding round,"
13272,BOOK XVI.,Trojans and Greeks in stubborn conflict clos’d.
13273,BOOK XVI.,
13274,BOOK XVI.,"As when, encount’ring in some mountain-glen,"
13275,BOOK XVI.,"Eurus and Notus shake the forest deep,"
13276,BOOK XVI.,"Of oak, or ash, or slender cornel-tree,"
13277,BOOK XVI.,"Whose tap’ring branches are together thrown,"
13278,BOOK XVI.,"With fearful din, and crash of broken boughs;"
13279,BOOK XVI.,"So mix’d confus’dly, Greeks and Trojans fought,"
13280,BOOK XVI.,No thought of flight by either entertain’d.
13281,BOOK XVI.,"Thick o’er Cebriones the jav’lins flew,"
13282,BOOK XVI.,"And feather’d arrows, bounding from the string;"
13283,BOOK XVI.,"And pond’rous stones that on the bucklers rang,"
13284,BOOK XVI.,As round the dead they fought; amid the dust
13285,BOOK XVI.,"That eddying rose, his art forgotten all,"
13286,BOOK XVI.,"A mighty warrior, mightily he lay."
13287,BOOK XVI.,"While in mid Heav’n the sun pursued his course,"
13288,BOOK XVI.,"Thick flew the shafts, and fast the people fell"
13289,BOOK XVI.,On either side; but when declining day
13290,BOOK XVI.,"Brought on the hour that sees the loosen’d steers,"
13291,BOOK XVI.,The Greeks were stronger far; and from the darts
13292,BOOK XVI.,And Trojan battle-cry Cebriones
13293,BOOK XVI.,"They drew, and from his breast his armour stripp’d."
13294,BOOK XVI.,Fiercely Patroclus on the Trojans fell:
13295,BOOK XVI.,"Thrice he assail’d them, terrible as Mars,"
13296,BOOK XVI.,With fearful shouts; and thrice nine foes he slew:
13297,BOOK XVI.,"But when again, with more than mortal force"
13298,BOOK XVI.,"His fourth assault he made, thy term of life,"
13299,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus, then approach’d its final close;"
13300,BOOK XVI.,"For Phoebus’ awful self encounter’d thee,"
13301,BOOK XVI.,"Amid the battle-throng, of thee unseen,"
13302,BOOK XVI.,For thickest darkness shrouded all his form:
13303,BOOK XVI.,"He stood behind, and with extended palm"
13304,BOOK XVI.,Dealt on Patroclus’ neck and shoulders broad
13305,BOOK XVI.,"A mighty buffet; dizzy swam his eyes,"
13306,BOOK XVI.,And from his head Apollo snatch’d the helm;
13307,BOOK XVI.,"Clank’d, as it roll’d beneath the horses’ feet,"
13308,BOOK XVI.,The visor’d helm; the horsehair plume with blood
13309,BOOK XVI.,And dust polluted; never till that day
13310,BOOK XVI.,"Was that proud helmet so with dust defil’d,"
13311,BOOK XVI.,"That wont to deck a godlike chief, and guard"
13312,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles’ noble head, and graceful brow:"
13313,BOOK XVI.,Now by the will of Jove to Hector giv’n.
13314,BOOK XVI.,Now death was near at hand; and in his grasp
13315,BOOK XVI.,"His spear was shiver’d, pond’rous, long, and tough,"
13316,BOOK XVI.,"Brass-pointed; with its belt, the ample shield"
13317,BOOK XVI.,"Fell from his shoulders; and Apollo’s hand,"
13318,BOOK XVI.,"The royal son of Jove, his corslet loos’d."
13319,BOOK XVI.,Then was his mind bewilder’d; and his limbs
13320,BOOK XVI.,Gave way beneath him; all aghast he stood:
13321,BOOK XVI.,"Him, from behind, a Dardan, Panthous’ son,"
13322,BOOK XVI.,"Euphorbus, peerless ’mid the Trojan youth,"
13323,BOOK XVI.,"To hurl the spear, to run, to drive the car,"
13324,BOOK XVI.,"Approaching close, between the shoulders stabb’d;"
13325,BOOK XVI.,"He, train’d to warfare, from his car, ere this"
13326,BOOK XVI.,A score of Greeks had from their chariots hurl’d:
13327,BOOK XVI.,"Such was the man who thee, Patroclus, first"
13328,BOOK XVI.,"Wounded, but not subdued; the ashen spear"
13329,BOOK XVI.,"He, in all haste, withdrew; nor dar’d confront"
13330,BOOK XVI.,"Patroclus, though disarm’d, in deadly strife."
13331,BOOK XVI.,
13332,BOOK XVI.,"Back to his comrades’ shelt’ring ranks retir’d,"
13333,BOOK XVI.,"From certain death, Patroclus: by the stroke"
13334,BOOK XVI.,"Of Phoebus vanquish’d, and Euphorbus’ spear:"
13335,BOOK XVI.,"But Hector, when Patroclus from the fight"
13336,BOOK XVI.,"He saw retreating, wounded, through the ranks"
13337,BOOK XVI.,"Advancing, smote him through the flank; right through"
13338,BOOK XVI.,The brazen spear was driv’n; thund’ring he fell;
13339,BOOK XVI.,And deeply mourn’d his fall the Grecian host.
13340,BOOK XVI.,
13341,BOOK XVI.,As when a lion hath in fight o’erborne
13342,BOOK XVI.,"A tusked boar, when on the mountain top"
13343,BOOK XVI.,"They two have met, in all their pride of strength,"
13344,BOOK XVI.,"Both parch’d with thirst, around a scanty spring;"
13345,BOOK XVI.,"And vanquish’d by the lion’s force, the boar"
13346,BOOK XVI.,"Hath yielded, gasping; so Menoetius’ son,"
13347,BOOK XVI.,"Great deeds achiev’d, at length beneath the spear"
13348,BOOK XVI.,Of noble Hector yielded up his life;
13349,BOOK XVI.,"Who o’er the vanquish’d, thus exulting, spoke:"
13350,BOOK XVI.,"“Patroclus, but of late thou mad’st thy boast"
13351,BOOK XVI.,"To raze our city walls, and in your ships"
13352,BOOK XVI.,"To bear away to your far-distant land,"
13353,BOOK XVI.,"Their days of freedom lost, our Trojan dames:"
13354,BOOK XVI.,"Fool that thou wast! nor knew’st, in their defence,"
13355,BOOK XVI.,That Hector’s flying coursers scour’d the plain;
13356,BOOK XVI.,"From them, the bravest of the Trojans, I"
13357,BOOK XVI.,Avert the day of doom; while on our shores
13358,BOOK XVI.,Thy flesh shall glut the carrion birds of Troy.
13359,BOOK XVI.,"Poor wretch! though brave he be, yet Peleus’ son"
13360,BOOK XVI.,"Avail’d thee nought, when, hanging back himself,"
13361,BOOK XVI.,With sage advice he sent thee forth to fight:
13362,BOOK XVI.,"‘Come not to me, Patroclus, car-borne chief,"
13363,BOOK XVI.,"Nor to the ships return, until thou bear"
13364,BOOK XVI.,"The warrior-slayer Hector’s bloody spoils,"
13365,BOOK XVI.,"Torn from his body;’ such were, I suppose,"
13366,BOOK XVI.,"His counsels; thou, poor fool, becam’st his dupe.”"
13367,BOOK XVI.,To whom Patroclus thus in accents faint:
13368,BOOK XVI.,
13369,BOOK XVI.,"“Hector, thou boastest loudly now, that Jove,"
13370,BOOK XVI.,"With Phoebus join’d, hath thee with vict’ry crown’d:"
13371,BOOK XVI.,"They wrought my death, who stripp’d me of my arms."
13372,BOOK XVI.,"Had I to deal with twenty such as thee,"
13373,BOOK XVI.,"They all should perish, vanquish’d by my spear:"
13374,BOOK XVI.,"Me fate hath slain, and Phoebus; and, of men,"
13375,BOOK XVI.,Euphorbus; thou wast but the third to strike.
13376,BOOK XVI.,"This too I say, and bear it in thy mind;"
13377,BOOK XVI.,Not long shalt thou survive me; death e’en now
13378,BOOK XVI.,"And final doom hangs o’er thee, by the hand"
13379,BOOK XVI.,"Of great Achilles, Peleus’ matchless son.”"
13380,BOOK XVI.,
13381,BOOK XVI.,"Thus as he spoke, the gloom of death his eyes"
13382,BOOK XVI.,"O’erspread, and to the shades his spirit fled,"
13383,BOOK XVI.,"Mourning his fate, his youth and strength cut off."
13384,BOOK XVI.,"To whom, though dead, the noble Hector thus:"
13385,BOOK XVI.,"“Patroclus, why predict my coming fate?"
13386,BOOK XVI.,"Or who can say but fair-hair’d Thetis’ son,"
13387,BOOK XVI.,"Achilles, by my spear may first be slain?”"
13388,BOOK XVI.,
13389,BOOK XVI.,"He said, and planting firm his foot, withdrew"
13390,BOOK XVI.,"The brazen spear, and backward drove the dead"
13391,BOOK XVI.,"From off the weapon’s point; then, spear in hand,"
13392,BOOK XVI.,"Intent to slay, Automedon pursued,"
13393,BOOK XVI.,The godlike follower of Æacides:
13394,BOOK XVI.,"But him in safety bore th’ immortal steeds,"
13395,BOOK XVI.,The noble prize the Gods to Peleus gave.

13421,BOOK XVII.,BOOK XVII.
13422,BOOK XVII.,
13423,BOOK XVII.,"Nor was Patroclus’ fall, by Trojans slain,"
13424,BOOK XVII.,Of warlike Menelaus unobserv’d;
13425,BOOK XVII.,"Forward he sprang, in dazzling arms array’d,"
13426,BOOK XVII.,"And round him mov’d, as round her new-dropp’d calf"
13427,BOOK XVII.,"Her first, a heifer moves with plaintive moan:"
13428,BOOK XVII.,"So round Patroclus Menelaus mov’d,"
13429,BOOK XVII.,"His shield’s broad orb and spear before him held,"
13430,BOOK XVII.,To all who might oppose him threat’ning death.
13431,BOOK XVII.,"Nor, on his side, was Panthous’ noble son"
13432,BOOK XVII.,"Unmindful of the slain; but, standing near,"
13433,BOOK XVII.,The warlike Menelaus thus address’d:
13434,BOOK XVII.,
13435,BOOK XVII.,"“Illustrious son of Atreus, Heav’n-born chief,"
13436,BOOK XVII.,Quit thou the dead; yield up the bloody spoils:
13437,BOOK XVII.,"For, of the Trojans and their fam’d Allies,"
13438,BOOK XVII.,Mine was the hand that in the stubborn fight
13439,BOOK XVII.,First struck Patroclus; leave me then to wear
13440,BOOK XVII.,"Among the men of Troy my honours due,"
13441,BOOK XVII.,Lest by my spear thou lose thy cherish’d life.”
13442,BOOK XVII.,
13443,BOOK XVII.,To whom in anger Menelaus thus:
13444,BOOK XVII.,"“O Father Jove, how ill this vaunting tone"
13445,BOOK XVII.,"Beseems this braggart! In their own esteem,"
13446,BOOK XVII.,“With Panthous’ sons for courage none may vie;
13447,BOOK XVII.,"Nor pard, nor lion, nor the forest boar,"
13448,BOOK XVII.,"Fiercest of beasts, and proudest of his strength."
13449,BOOK XVII.,Yet nought avail’d to Hyperenor’s might
13450,BOOK XVII.,"His youthful vigour, when he held me cheap,"
13451,BOOK XVII.,And my encounter dar’d; of all the Greeks
13452,BOOK XVII.,"He deem’d my prowess least; yet he, I ween,"
13453,BOOK XVII.,"On his own feet return’d not, to rejoice"
13454,BOOK XVII.,His tender wife’s and honour’d parents’ sight.
13455,BOOK XVII.,"So shall thy pride be quell’d, if me thou dare"
13456,BOOK XVII.,"Encounter; but I warn thee, while ’tis time,"
13457,BOOK XVII.,"Ere ill betide thee, ’mid the gen’ral throng"
13458,BOOK XVII.,"That thou withdraw, nor stand to me oppos’d."
13459,BOOK XVII.,After th’ event may e’en a fool be wise.”
13460,BOOK XVII.,He spoke in vain; Euphorbus thus replied:
13461,BOOK XVII.,
13462,BOOK XVII.,"“Now, Heav’n-born Menelaus, shalt thou pay"
13463,BOOK XVII.,"The forfeit for my brother’s life, o’er whom,"
13464,BOOK XVII.,"Slain by thy hand, thou mak’st thy boasting speech."
13465,BOOK XVII.,Thou in the chambers of her new-found home
13466,BOOK XVII.,Hast made his bride a weeping widow; thou
13467,BOOK XVII.,Hast fill’d with bitt’rest grief his parents’ hearts:
13468,BOOK XVII.,"Some solace might those hapless mourners find,"
13469,BOOK XVII.,Could I thy head and armour in the hands
13470,BOOK XVII.,Of Panthous and of honour’d Phrontis place;
13471,BOOK XVII.,"Nor uncontested shall the proof remain,"
13472,BOOK XVII.,"Nor long deferr’d, of vict’ry or defeat.”"
13473,BOOK XVII.,
13474,BOOK XVII.,"He said, and struck the centre of the shield,"
13475,BOOK XVII.,But broke not through; against the stubborn brass
13476,BOOK XVII.,The point was bent; then with a pray’r to Jove
13477,BOOK XVII.,The son of Atreus in his turn advanc’d;
13478,BOOK XVII.,"And, backward as he stepp’d, below his throat"
13479,BOOK XVII.,"Took aim, and pressing hard with stalwart hand"
13480,BOOK XVII.,Drove through the yielding neck the pond’rous spear:
13481,BOOK XVII.,"Thund’ring he fell, and loud his armour rang."
13482,BOOK XVII.,"Those locks, that with the Graces’ hair might vie,"
13483,BOOK XVII.,"Those tresses bright, with gold and silver bound,"
13484,BOOK XVII.,Were dabbled all with blood. As when a man
13485,BOOK XVII.,"Hath rear’d a fair and vig’rous olive plant,"
13486,BOOK XVII.,"In some lone spot, by copious-gushing springs,"
13487,BOOK XVII.,"And seen expanding, nurs’d by ev’ry breeze,"
13488,BOOK XVII.,Its whit’ning blossoms; till with sudden gust
13489,BOOK XVII.,A sweeping hurricane of wind and rain
13490,BOOK XVII.,"Uproots it from its bed, and prostrate lays;"
13491,BOOK XVII.,"So lay the youthful son of Panthous, slain"
13492,BOOK XVII.,"By Atreus’ son, and of his arms despoil’d."
13493,BOOK XVII.,"And as a lion, in the mountains bred,"
13494,BOOK XVII.,"In pride of strength, amid the pasturing herd"
13495,BOOK XVII.,"Seizes a heifer in his pow’rful jaws,"
13496,BOOK XVII.,"The choicest; and, her neck first broken, rends,"
13497,BOOK XVII.,"And, on her entrails gorging, laps the blood;"
13498,BOOK XVII.,Though with loud clamour dogs and herdsmen round
13499,BOOK XVII.,"Assail him from afar, yet ventures none"
13500,BOOK XVII.,"To meet his rage, for fear is on them all;"
13501,BOOK XVII.,"So none was there so bold, with dauntless breast"
13502,BOOK XVII.,The noble Menelaus’ wrath to meet.
13503,BOOK XVII.,Now had Atrides borne away with ease
13504,BOOK XVII.,The spoils of Panthous’ son; but Phoebus grudg’d
13505,BOOK XVII.,"His prize of vict’ry, and against him launch’d"
13506,BOOK XVII.,"The might of Hector, terrible as Mars:"
13507,BOOK XVII.,"To whom his winged words, in Mentes’ form,"
13508,BOOK XVII.,"Chief of the Cicones, he thus address’d:"
13509,BOOK XVII.,
13510,BOOK XVII.,"“Hector, thy labour all is vain, pursuing"
13511,BOOK XVII.,Pelides’ flying steeds; and hard are they
13512,BOOK XVII.,"For mortal man to harness, or control."
13513,BOOK XVII.,"Save for Achilles’ self, the Goddess-born."
13514,BOOK XVII.,"The valiant Menelaus, Atreus’ son,"
13515,BOOK XVII.,Defends meanwhile Patroclus; and e’en now
13516,BOOK XVII.,"Hath slain a noble Trojan, Panthous’ son,"
13517,BOOK XVII.,"Euphorbus, and his youthful vigour quell’d.”"
13518,BOOK XVII.,
13519,BOOK XVII.,"He said, and join’d again the strife of men:"
13520,BOOK XVII.,Hector’s dark soul with bitter grief was fill’d;
13521,BOOK XVII.,"He look’d amid the ranks, and saw the two,"
13522,BOOK XVII.,"One slain, the other stripping off his arms,"
13523,BOOK XVII.,The blood outpouring from the gaping wound.
13524,BOOK XVII.,"Forward he sprang, in dazzling arms array’d,"
13525,BOOK XVII.,"Loud shouting, blazing like the quenchless flames"
13526,BOOK XVII.,"Of Vulcan: Menelaus heard the shout,"
13527,BOOK XVII.,"And, troubled, commun’d with his valiant heart:"
13528,BOOK XVII.,
13529,BOOK XVII.,"“Oh, woe is me! for should I now the spoils"
13530,BOOK XVII.,"Abandon, and Patroclus, who for me"
13531,BOOK XVII.,"And in my cause lies slain, of any Greek"
13532,BOOK XVII.,"Who saw me, I might well incur the blame:"
13533,BOOK XVII.,And yet if here alone I dare to fight
13534,BOOK XVII.,"With Hector and his Trojans, much I fear,"
13535,BOOK XVII.,"Singly, to be by numbers overwhelm’d;"
13536,BOOK XVII.,For Hector all the Trojans hither brings.
13537,BOOK XVII.,"But wherefore entertain such thoughts, my soul?"
13538,BOOK XVII.,"Who strives, against the will divine, with one"
13539,BOOK XVII.,"Belov’d of Heav’n, a bitter doom must meet."
13540,BOOK XVII.,"Then none may blame me, though I should retreat"
13541,BOOK XVII.,"From Hector, who with Heav’n’s assistance wars."
13542,BOOK XVII.,"Yet could I hear brave Ajax’ battle cry,"
13543,BOOK XVII.,"We two, returning, would the encounter dare,"
13544,BOOK XVII.,"E’en against Heav’n, if so for Peleus’ son"
13545,BOOK XVII.,"We might regain, and bear away the dead:"
13546,BOOK XVII.,Some solace of our loss might then be ours.”
13547,BOOK XVII.,
13548,BOOK XVII.,"While in his mind and spirit thus he mus’d,"
13549,BOOK XVII.,"By Hector led, the Trojan ranks advanc’d:"
13550,BOOK XVII.,"Backward he mov’d, abandoning the dead;"
13551,BOOK XVII.,"But turning oft, as when by men and dogs"
13552,BOOK XVII.,A bearded lion from the fold is driv’n
13553,BOOK XVII.,"With shouts and spears; yet grieves his mighty heart,"
13554,BOOK XVII.,And with reluctant step he quits the yard:
13555,BOOK XVII.,So from Patroclus Menelaus mov’d;
13556,BOOK XVII.,"Yet when he reach’d his comrades’ ranks, he turn’d,"
13557,BOOK XVII.,"And look’d around, if haply he might find"
13558,BOOK XVII.,"The mighty Ajax, son of Telamon."
13559,BOOK XVII.,"Him on the battle’s farthest left he spied,"
13560,BOOK XVII.,"Cheering his friends and urging to the fight,"
13561,BOOK XVII.,For sorely Phoebus had their courage tried;
13562,BOOK XVII.,"And hast’ning to his side, address’d him thus:"
13563,BOOK XVII.,
13564,BOOK XVII.,"“Ajax, haste hither; to the rescue come"
13565,BOOK XVII.,Of slain Patroclus; if perchance we two
13566,BOOK XVII.,"May to Achilles, Peleus’ son, restore"
13567,BOOK XVII.,"His body: his naked body, for his arms"
13568,BOOK XVII.,Are prize to Hector of the glancing helm.”
13569,BOOK XVII.,
13570,BOOK XVII.,"He said, and Ajax’ spirit within him stirr’d;"
13571,BOOK XVII.,"Forward he sprang, and with him Atreus’ son."
13572,BOOK XVII.,"Hector was dragging now Patroclus’ corpse,"
13573,BOOK XVII.,"Stripped of its glitt’ring armour, and intent"
13574,BOOK XVII.,"The head to sever with his sword, and give"
13575,BOOK XVII.,The mangled carcase to the dogs of Troy:
13576,BOOK XVII.,"But Ajax, with his tow’r-like shield, approach’d;"
13577,BOOK XVII.,"Then Hector to his comrades’ ranks withdrew,"
13578,BOOK XVII.,"Rush’d to his car, and bade the Trojans bear"
13579,BOOK XVII.,"The glitt’ring arms, his glorious prize, to Troy:"
13580,BOOK XVII.,While Ajax with his mighty shield o’erspread
13581,BOOK XVII.,"Menoetius’ son; and stood, as for his cubs"
13582,BOOK XVII.,"A lion stands, whom hunters, unaware,"
13583,BOOK XVII.,Have with his offspring met amid the woods.
13584,BOOK XVII.,"Proud in his strength he stands; and down are drawn,"
13585,BOOK XVII.,"Cov’ring his eyes, the wrinkles of his brow:"
13586,BOOK XVII.,"So o’er Patroclus mighty Ajax stood,"
13587,BOOK XVII.,"And by his side, his heart with grief oppress’d,"
13588,BOOK XVII.,"The warlike Menelaus, Atreus’ son."
13589,BOOK XVII.,
13590,BOOK XVII.,"Then Glaucus, leader of the Lycian host,"
13591,BOOK XVII.,"To Hector thus, with scornful glance, address’d"
13592,BOOK XVII.,"His keen reproaches: “Hector, fair of form,"
13593,BOOK XVII.,"How art thou wanting in the fight! thy fame,"
13594,BOOK XVII.,"Coward and runaway, thou hast belied."
13595,BOOK XVII.,"Bethink thee now, if thou alone canst save"
13596,BOOK XVII.,"The city, aided but by Trojans born;"
13597,BOOK XVII.,Henceforth no Lycian will go forth for Troy
13598,BOOK XVII.,To fight with Greeks; since favour none we gain
13599,BOOK XVII.,By unremitting toil against the foe.
13600,BOOK XVII.,"How can a meaner man expect thine aid,"
13601,BOOK XVII.,Who basely to the Greeks a prize and spoil
13602,BOOK XVII.,"Sarpedon leav’st, thy comrade and thy guest?"
13603,BOOK XVII.,"Greatly he serv’d the city and thyself,"
13604,BOOK XVII.,While yet he liv’d; and now thou dar’st not save
13605,BOOK XVII.,His body from the dogs! By my advice
13606,BOOK XVII.,"If Lycians will be rul’d, we take at once"
13607,BOOK XVII.,"Our homeward way, and Troy may meet her doom."
13608,BOOK XVII.,But if in Trojan bosoms there abode
13609,BOOK XVII.,"The daring, dauntless courage, meet for men"
13610,BOOK XVII.,Who in their country’s cause against the foe
13611,BOOK XVII.,"Endure both toil and war, we soon should see"
13612,BOOK XVII.,Patroclus brought within the walls of Troy;
13613,BOOK XVII.,"Him from the battle could we bear away,"
13614,BOOK XVII.,"And, lifeless, bring to royal Priam’s town,"
13615,BOOK XVII.,"Soon would the Greeks Sarpedon’s arms release,"
13616,BOOK XVII.,And we to Ilium’s heights himself might bear:
13617,BOOK XVII.,For with his valiant comrades there lies slain
13618,BOOK XVII.,The follower of the bravest chief of Greece.
13619,BOOK XVII.,But thou before the mighty Ajax stood’st
13620,BOOK XVII.,"With downcast eyes, nor durst in manly fight"
13621,BOOK XVII.,Contend with one thy better far confess’d.”
13622,BOOK XVII.,
13623,BOOK XVII.,"To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm,"
13624,BOOK XVII.,"With stern regard, replied: “Why, Glaucus, speak,"
13625,BOOK XVII.,"Brave as thou art, in this o’erbearing strain?"
13626,BOOK XVII.,"Good friend, I heretofore have held thee wise"
13627,BOOK XVII.,O’er all who dwell in Lycia’s fertile soil;
13628,BOOK XVII.,"But now I change, and hold thy judgment cheap,"
13629,BOOK XVII.,Who chargest me with flying from the might
13630,BOOK XVII.,Of giant Ajax; never have I shrunk
13631,BOOK XVII.,"From the stern fight, and clatter of the cars;"
13632,BOOK XVII.,"But all o’erruling is the mind of Jove,"
13633,BOOK XVII.,"Who strikes with panic, and of vict’ry robs"
13634,BOOK XVII.,The bravest; and anon excites to war.
13635,BOOK XVII.,"Stand by me now, and see if through the day"
13636,BOOK XVII.,"I prove myself the coward that thou say’st,"
13637,BOOK XVII.,"Or suffer that a Greek, how brave soe’er,"
13638,BOOK XVII.,Shall rescue from my hands Patroclus’ corpse.”
13639,BOOK XVII.,
13640,BOOK XVII.,"He said, and loudly on the Trojans call’d:"
13641,BOOK XVII.,"“Trojans and Lycians, and ye Dardans, fam’d"
13642,BOOK XVII.,"In close encounter, quit ye now like men;"
13643,BOOK XVII.,"Maintain awhile the stubborn fight, while I"
13644,BOOK XVII.,"The splendid armour of Achilles don,"
13645,BOOK XVII.,My glorious prize from slain Patroclus torn.”
13646,BOOK XVII.,
13647,BOOK XVII.,"So saying, Hector of the glancing helm,"
13648,BOOK XVII.,"Withdrawing from the field, with rapid steps"
13649,BOOK XVII.,"His comrades follow’d, and ere long o’ertook,"
13650,BOOK XVII.,Who tow’rd the town Achilles’ armour bore;
13651,BOOK XVII.,Then standing from the bloody fight aloof
13652,BOOK XVII.,The armour he exchang’d; his own he bade
13653,BOOK XVII.,The warlike Trojans to the city bear;
13654,BOOK XVII.,"While he, of Peleus’ son, Achilles, donn’d"
13655,BOOK XVII.,"The heav’nly armour, which th’ immortal Gods"
13656,BOOK XVII.,Gave to his sire; he to his son convey’d;
13657,BOOK XVII.,Yet in that armour grew not old that son.
13658,BOOK XVII.,
13659,BOOK XVII.,Him when apart the Cloud-compeller saw
13660,BOOK XVII.,"Girt with the arms of Peleus’ godlike son,"
13661,BOOK XVII.,"He shook his head, and inly thus he mus’d:"
13662,BOOK XVII.,"“Ah hapless! little deem’st thou of thy fate,"
13663,BOOK XVII.,"Though now so nigh! Thou of the prime of men,"
13664,BOOK XVII.,"The dread of all, hast donn’d th’ immortal arms,"
13665,BOOK XVII.,"Whose comrade, brave and good, thy hand hath slain;"
13666,BOOK XVII.,"And sham’d him, stripping from his head and breast"
13667,BOOK XVII.,Helmet and cuirass; yet thy latest hours
13668,BOOK XVII.,"Will I with glory crown; since ne’er from thee,"
13669,BOOK XVII.,"Return’d from battle, shall Andromache"
13670,BOOK XVII.,Receive the spoils of Peleus’ godlike son.”
13671,BOOK XVII.,
13672,BOOK XVII.,"He said, and nodded with his shadowy brows;"
13673,BOOK XVII.,"Then with the armour, fitted to his form"
13674,BOOK XVII.,"By Jove himself, was Hector girt by Mars"
13675,BOOK XVII.,The fierce and terrible; with vig’rous strength
13676,BOOK XVII.,"His limbs were strung, as ’mid his brave allies"
13677,BOOK XVII.,"He sprang, loud-shouting; glitt’ring in his arms,"
13678,BOOK XVII.,To all he seem’d Achilles’ godlike self.
13679,BOOK XVII.,"To each and all in cheering tones he spoke,"
13680,BOOK XVII.,"Mesthles and Glaucus and Thersilochus,"
13681,BOOK XVII.,"Asteropaeus and Hippothous,"
13682,BOOK XVII.,"Medon, Deisenor, Phoreys, Chromius,"
13683,BOOK XVII.,And Ennomus the seer: to all of these
13684,BOOK XVII.,His winged words he cheeringly address’d:
13685,BOOK XVII.,
13686,BOOK XVII.,"“Hear me, ye countless tribes, that dwelling round"
13687,BOOK XVII.,Assist our cause! You from your sev’ral homes
13688,BOOK XVII.,"Not for display of numbers have I call’d,"
13689,BOOK XVII.,But that with willing hearts ye should defend
13690,BOOK XVII.,Our wives and infants from the warlike Greeks:
13691,BOOK XVII.,"For this I drain my people’s stores, for food"
13692,BOOK XVII.,"And gifts for you, exalting your estate;"
13693,BOOK XVII.,"Then, who will boldly onward, he may fall,"
13694,BOOK XVII.,"Or safe escape, such is the chance of war;"
13695,BOOK XVII.,But who within our valiant Trojans’ ranks
13696,BOOK XVII.,"Shall but the body of Patroclus bring,"
13697,BOOK XVII.,Despite the might of Ajax; half the spoils
13698,BOOK XVII.,"To him I give, the other half myself"
13699,BOOK XVII.,Retaining; and his praise shall equal mine.”
13700,BOOK XVII.,
13701,BOOK XVII.,"He said; and onward, with uplifted spears,"
13702,BOOK XVII.,They march’d upon the Greeks; high rose their hopes
13703,BOOK XVII.,From Ajax Telamon to snatch the dead;
13704,BOOK XVII.,"Vain hopes, which cost them many a life! Then thus"
13705,BOOK XVII.,To valiant Menelaus Ajax spoke;
13706,BOOK XVII.,
13707,BOOK XVII.,"“O Heav’n-born Menelaus, noble friend,"
13708,BOOK XVII.,For safe return I dare no longer hope:
13709,BOOK XVII.,"Not for Patroclus’ corpse so much I fear,"
13710,BOOK XVII.,"Which soon will glut the dogs and birds of Troy,"
13711,BOOK XVII.,As for my life and thine I tremble now:
13712,BOOK XVII.,"For, like a war-cloud, Hector’s might I see"
13713,BOOK XVII.,O’ershadowing all around; now is our doom
13714,BOOK XVII.,Apparent; but do thou for succour call
13715,BOOK XVII.,"On all the chiefs, if haply they may hear.”"
13716,BOOK XVII.,"Thus Ajax spoke: obedient to his word,"
13717,BOOK XVII.,On all the chiefs Atrides call’d aloud:
13718,BOOK XVII.,
13719,BOOK XVII.,"“O friends, the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
13720,BOOK XVII.,All ye that banquet at the gen’ral cost
13721,BOOK XVII.,"With Atreus’ sons, and o’er your sev’ral states"
13722,BOOK XVII.,Dominion hold; whose honour is of Jove;
13723,BOOK XVII.,"’Twere hard to call by name each single man,"
13724,BOOK XVII.,So fierce the combat rages; but let each
13725,BOOK XVII.,"And all their aid afford, and deem, it shame"
13726,BOOK XVII.,Patroclus’ corpse should glut the dogs of Troy.”
13727,BOOK XVII.,
13728,BOOK XVII.,"He said: first heard Oileus’ active son,"
13729,BOOK XVII.,"And hast’ning through the fray, beside him stood."
13730,BOOK XVII.,"Next him Idomeneus, with whom there came,"
13731,BOOK XVII.,"Valiant as Mars, his friend Meriones."
13732,BOOK XVII.,"But who can know or tell the names of all,"
13733,BOOK XVII.,"Who, following, swell’d the battle of the Greeks?"
13734,BOOK XVII.,"Onward the Trojans press’d, by Hector led:"
13735,BOOK XVII.,"With such a sound, as when the ocean wave"
13736,BOOK XVII.,"Meets on the beach th’ outpouring of a stream,"
13737,BOOK XVII.,Swoll’n by the rains of Heav’n: the lofty cliffs
13738,BOOK XVII.,"Resound, and bellows the big sea without;"
13739,BOOK XVII.,With such a sound advanc’d the Trojan host:
13740,BOOK XVII.,"While round Patroclus, with one heart and mind,"
13741,BOOK XVII.,The Greeks a fence of brass-clad bucklers rais’d.
13742,BOOK XVII.,O’er their bright helms the son of Saturn shed
13743,BOOK XVII.,"A veil of darkness; for Menoetius’ son,"
13744,BOOK XVII.,"Achilles’ faithful friend, while yet he liv’d"
13745,BOOK XVII.,"Jove hated not, nor would that now his corpse"
13746,BOOK XVII.,"Should to the dogs of Troy remain a prey,"
13747,BOOK XVII.,But to the rescue all his comrades stirr’d.
13748,BOOK XVII.,At first the Trojans drove the keen-ey’d Greeks;
13749,BOOK XVII.,"Leaving the corpse, they fled; nor with their spears"
13750,BOOK XVII.,The valiant Trojans reach’d a single Greek;
13751,BOOK XVII.,But on the dead they seiz’d; yet not for long
13752,BOOK XVII.,"Endur’d their flight; them Ajax rallied soon,"
13753,BOOK XVII.,"In form pre-eminent, and deeds of arms,"
13754,BOOK XVII.,"O’er all the Greeks, save Peleus’ matchless son."
13755,BOOK XVII.,"Onward he sprang, as springs a mountain boar,"
13756,BOOK XVII.,"Which, turning in the forest glade to bay,"
13757,BOOK XVII.,Scatters with ease both dogs and stalwart youths;
13758,BOOK XVII.,"So Ajax scatter’d soon the Trojan ranks,"
13759,BOOK XVII.,"That round Patroclus closing, hop’d to bear,"
13760,BOOK XVII.,"With glory to themselves, his corpse to Troy."
13761,BOOK XVII.,"Hippothous, Pelasgian Lethus’ son,"
13762,BOOK XVII.,"Was dragging by the feet the noble dead,"
13763,BOOK XVII.,"A leathern belt around his ancles bound,"
13764,BOOK XVII.,Seeking the favour of the men of Troy;
13765,BOOK XVII.,"But on himself he brought destruction down,"
13766,BOOK XVII.,Which none might turn aside; for from the crowd
13767,BOOK XVII.,"Outsprang the son of Telamon, and struck,"
13768,BOOK XVII.,"In close encounter, on the brass-cheek’d helm;"
13769,BOOK XVII.,"The plumed helm was shiver’d by the blow,"
13770,BOOK XVII.,Dealt by a weighty spear and stalwart hand;
13771,BOOK XVII.,"Gush’d from the wound the mingled blood and brain,"
13772,BOOK XVII.,His vital spirit quench’d; and on the ground
13773,BOOK XVII.,Fell from his pow’rless grasp Patroclus’ foot;
13774,BOOK XVII.,"While he himself lay stretch’d beside the dead,"
13775,BOOK XVII.,Far from his own Larissa’s teeming soil:
13776,BOOK XVII.,Not destin’d he his parents to repay
13777,BOOK XVII.,"Their early care; for short his term of life,"
13778,BOOK XVII.,By godlike Ajax’ mighty spear subdu’d.
13779,BOOK XVII.,
13780,BOOK XVII.,At Ajax Hector threw his glitt’ring spear:
13781,BOOK XVII.,"He saw, and narrowly the brazen death"
13782,BOOK XVII.,"Escap’d; but Schedius, son of Iphitus,"
13783,BOOK XVII.,"(The bravest of the Phocian chiefs, who dwelt"
13784,BOOK XVII.,"In far-fam’d Panopeus, the mighty Lord"
13785,BOOK XVII.,"Of num’rous hosts,) below the collar-bone"
13786,BOOK XVII.,"It struck, and passing through, the brazen point"
13787,BOOK XVII.,Came forth again beneath his shoulder-blade:
13788,BOOK XVII.,"Thund’ring he fell, and loud his armour rang."
13789,BOOK XVII.,
13790,BOOK XVII.,"As Phorcys, son of Phaenops, kept his watch"
13791,BOOK XVII.,"O’er slain Hippothous, him Ajax smote"
13792,BOOK XVII.,Below the waist; the weighty spear broke through
13793,BOOK XVII.,"The hollow breastplate, and th’ intestines tore;"
13794,BOOK XVII.,"Prone in the dust he fell, and clutch’d the ground."
13795,BOOK XVII.,At this the Trojan chiefs and Hector’s self
13796,BOOK XVII.,"’Gan to give way; the Greeks, with joyful shouts,"
13797,BOOK XVII.,"Seiz’d both the dead, and stripp’d their armour off."
13798,BOOK XVII.,"To Ilium now, before the warlike Greeks,"
13799,BOOK XVII.,"O’ercome by panic, had the Trojans fled;"
13800,BOOK XVII.,"And now had Greeks, despite the will of Jove,"
13801,BOOK XVII.,"By their own strength and courage, won the day,"
13802,BOOK XVII.,"Had not Apollo’s self Æneas rous’d,"
13803,BOOK XVII.,"In likeness of a herald, Periphas,"
13804,BOOK XVII.,"The son of Epytus, now aged grown"
13805,BOOK XVII.,"In service of Æneas’ aged sire,"
13806,BOOK XVII.,A man of kindliest soul: his form assum’d
13807,BOOK XVII.,"Apollo, and Æneas thus address’d:"
13808,BOOK XVII.,
13809,BOOK XVII.,"“Æneas, how, against the will of Heav’n,"
13810,BOOK XVII.,"Could ye defend your city, as others now"
13811,BOOK XVII.,"In their own strength and courage confident,"
13812,BOOK XVII.,"Their numbers, and their troops’ undaunted hearts,"
13813,BOOK XVII.,I see their cause maintaining; if when Jove
13814,BOOK XVII.,"Rather to us than them the vict’ry wills,"
13815,BOOK XVII.,With fear unspeakable ye shun the fight?”
13816,BOOK XVII.,
13817,BOOK XVII.,He said: the presence of the Archer-God
13818,BOOK XVII.,"Æneas knew, and loud to Hector call’d:"
13819,BOOK XVII.,"“Hector, and all ye other chiefs of Troy,"
13820,BOOK XVII.,"And brave Allies, foul shame it were that we,"
13821,BOOK XVII.,"O’ercome by panic, should to Ilium now"
13822,BOOK XVII.,In flight be driv’n before the warlike Greeks;
13823,BOOK XVII.,"And by my side, but now, some God there stood,"
13824,BOOK XVII.,"And told how Jove, the sov’reign arbiter"
13825,BOOK XVII.,"Of battle, on our side bestow’d his aid;"
13826,BOOK XVII.,On then! nor undisturbed allow the Greeks
13827,BOOK XVII.,To bear Patroclus’ body to their ships.”
13828,BOOK XVII.,
13829,BOOK XVII.,"He said, and far before the ranks advanc’d;"
13830,BOOK XVII.,"They rallying turn’d, and fac’d again the Greeks."
13831,BOOK XVII.,Then first Æneas’ spear the comrade brave
13832,BOOK XVII.,"Of Lycomedes struck, Laocritus,"
13833,BOOK XVII.,Son of Arisbas; Lycomedes saw
13834,BOOK XVII.,With pitying eyes his gallant comrade’s fall;
13835,BOOK XVII.,"And standing near, his glitt’ring spear he threw,"
13836,BOOK XVII.,"And through the midriff Apisaon struck,"
13837,BOOK XVII.,"His people’s guardian chief, the valiant son"
13838,BOOK XVII.,"Of Hippasus, and slack’d his limbs in death."
13839,BOOK XVII.,"He from Paeonia’s fertile fields had come,"
13840,BOOK XVII.,"O’er all his comrades eminent in fight,"
13841,BOOK XVII.,"All save Asteropaeus, who with eyes"
13842,BOOK XVII.,"Of pity saw his gallant comrade’s fall,"
13843,BOOK XVII.,And forward sprang to battle with the Greeks;
13844,BOOK XVII.,Yet could not force his way; for all around
13845,BOOK XVII.,"Patroclus rose a fence of serried shields,"
13846,BOOK XVII.,And spears projecting: such the orders giv’n
13847,BOOK XVII.,"By Ajax, and with earnest care enforc’d;"
13848,BOOK XVII.,"That from around the dead should none retire,"
13849,BOOK XVII.,Nor any to the front advance alone
13850,BOOK XVII.,Before his fellows; but their steady guard
13851,BOOK XVII.,"Maintain, and hand to hand the battle wage."
13852,BOOK XVII.,So order’d Ajax; then with crimson blood
13853,BOOK XVII.,"The earth was wet; and hand to hand they fell,"
13854,BOOK XVII.,"Trojans alike, and brave Allies, and Greeks;"
13855,BOOK XVII.,"For neither these a bloodless fight sustain’d,"
13856,BOOK XVII.,Though fewer far their losses; for they stood
13857,BOOK XVII.,"Of mutual succour mindful, and support."
13858,BOOK XVII.,"Thus, furious as the rage of fire, they fought;"
13859,BOOK XVII.,Nor might ye deem the glorious sun himself
13860,BOOK XVII.,Nor moon was safe; for darkest clouds of night
13861,BOOK XVII.,"O’erspread the warriors, who the battle wag’d"
13862,BOOK XVII.,Around the body of Menoetius’ son:
13863,BOOK XVII.,Elsewhere the Trojans and the well-greav’d Greeks
13864,BOOK XVII.,"Fought, undisturb’d, in the clear light of day;"
13865,BOOK XVII.,The sun’s bright beams were shed abroad; no cloud
13866,BOOK XVII.,Lay on the face of earth or mountain tops;
13867,BOOK XVII.,"They but by fits, at distant intervals,"
13868,BOOK XVII.,"And far apart, each seeking to avoid"
13869,BOOK XVII.,"The hostile missiles, fought; but in the midst"
13870,BOOK XVII.,"The bravest all, in darkness and in strife"
13871,BOOK XVII.,"Sore press’d, toil’d on beneath their armour’s weight."
13872,BOOK XVII.,
13873,BOOK XVII.,As yet no tidings of Patroclus’ fall
13874,BOOK XVII.,"Had reach’d two valiant chiefs, Antilochus"
13875,BOOK XVII.,And Thrasymedes; but they deem’d him still
13876,BOOK XVII.,"Alive, and fighting in the foremost ranks."
13877,BOOK XVII.,"They, witnessing their comrades’ flight and death,"
13878,BOOK XVII.,"Fought on apart, by Nestor so enjoin’d,"
13879,BOOK XVII.,When from the ships he bade them join the fray.
13880,BOOK XVII.,"Great was meanwhile their labour, who sustain’d,"
13881,BOOK XVII.,"Throughout the livelong day, that weary fight;"
13882,BOOK XVII.,"Reek’d with continuous toil and sweat, the knees,"
13883,BOOK XVII.,"And legs and feet, the arms, and eyes, of all"
13884,BOOK XVII.,Who round Achilles’ faithful comrade fought.
13885,BOOK XVII.,As when a chief his people bids to stretch
13886,BOOK XVII.,"A huge bull’s hide, all drench’d and soak’d with grease;"
13887,BOOK XVII.,"They in a circle rang’d, this way and that,"
13888,BOOK XVII.,"Pull the tough hide, till ent’ring in, the grease"
13889,BOOK XVII.,Is all absorb’d; and dragg’d by num’rous hands
13890,BOOK XVII.,The supple skin to th’ utmost length is stretch’d;
13891,BOOK XVII.,So these in narrow space this way and that
13892,BOOK XVII.,The body dragg’d; and high the hopes of each
13893,BOOK XVII.,To bear it off in triumph; to their ships
13894,BOOK XVII.,"The Greeks, to Troy the Trojans; fiercely rag’d"
13895,BOOK XVII.,"The struggle; spirit-stirring Mars himself,"
13896,BOOK XVII.,"Or Pallas to her utmost fury rous’d,"
13897,BOOK XVII.,Had not that struggle with contempt beheld:
13898,BOOK XVII.,Such grievous labour o’er Patroclus’ corpse
13899,BOOK XVII.,Had Jove to horses and to men decreed.
13900,BOOK XVII.,
13901,BOOK XVII.,But of Patroclus’ fall no tidings yet
13902,BOOK XVII.,Had reach’d Achilles; for the war was wag’d
13903,BOOK XVII.,"Far from the ships, beneath the walls of Troy;"
13904,BOOK XVII.,"Nor look’d he of his death to hear, but deem’d"
13905,BOOK XVII.,"That when the Trojans to their gates were driv’n,"
13906,BOOK XVII.,He would return in safety; for no hope
13907,BOOK XVII.,"Had he of taking by assault the town,"
13908,BOOK XVII.,"With, or without, his aid; for oft apart"
13909,BOOK XVII.,"His Goddess-mother had his doom, foretold,"
13910,BOOK XVII.,Revealing to her son the mind of Jove;
13911,BOOK XVII.,"Yet ne’er had warn’d him of such grief as this,"
13912,BOOK XVII.,"Which now befell, his dearest comrade’s loss."
13913,BOOK XVII.,
13914,BOOK XVII.,"Still round the dead they held their pointed spears,"
13915,BOOK XVII.,"Fought hand to hand, and mutual slaughter dealt;"
13916,BOOK XVII.,And thus perchance some brass-clad Greek would say:
13917,BOOK XVII.,
13918,BOOK XVII.,"“O friends, ’twere shameful should we to the ships"
13919,BOOK XVII.,"Ingloriously return; ere that should be,"
13920,BOOK XVII.,Let earth engulph us all; so better far
13921,BOOK XVII.,Than let these Trojans to their city bear
13922,BOOK XVII.,"Our dead, and boast them of their triumph gain’d.”"
13923,BOOK XVII.,On th’ other hand some valiant Trojan thus
13924,BOOK XVII.,"Would shout: “O friends, tho’ fate decreed that here"
13925,BOOK XVII.,"We all should die, yet let not one give way.”"
13926,BOOK XVII.,
13927,BOOK XVII.,"Thus, cheering each his comrades, would they speak,"
13928,BOOK XVII.,And thus they fought; the iron clangour pierc’d
13929,BOOK XVII.,"The empty air, and brazen vault of Heav’n."
13930,BOOK XVII.,"But, from the fight withdrawn, Achilles’ steeds"
13931,BOOK XVII.,"Wept, as they heard how in the dust was laid"
13932,BOOK XVII.,"Their charioteer, by Hector’s murd’rous hand."
13933,BOOK XVII.,"Automedon, Diores’ valiant son,"
13934,BOOK XVII.,"Essay’d in vain to rouse them with the lash,"
13935,BOOK XVII.,"In vain with honey’d words, in vain with threats;"
13936,BOOK XVII.,Nor to the ships would they return again
13937,BOOK XVII.,"By the broad Hellespont, nor join the fray;"
13938,BOOK XVII.,"But as a column stands, which marks the tomb"
13939,BOOK XVII.,"Of man or woman, so immovable"
13940,BOOK XVII.,"Beneath the splendid car they stood, their heads"
13941,BOOK XVII.,"Down-drooping to the ground, while scalding tears"
13942,BOOK XVII.,"Dropp’d earthward from their eyelids, as they mourn’d"
13943,BOOK XVII.,Their charioteer; and o’er the yoke-band shed
13944,BOOK XVII.,"Down stream’d their ample manes, with dust defil’d."
13945,BOOK XVII.,"The son of Saturn pitying saw their grief,"
13946,BOOK XVII.,"And sorrowing shook his head, as thus he mus’d:"
13947,BOOK XVII.,
13948,BOOK XVII.,"“Ah, hapless horses! wherefore gave we you"
13949,BOOK XVII.,"To royal Peleus, to a mortal man,"
13950,BOOK XVII.,You that from age and death are both exempt!
13951,BOOK XVII.,Was it that you the miseries might share
13952,BOOK XVII.,"Of wretched mortals? for of all that breathe,"
13953,BOOK XVII.,"And walk upon the earth, or creep, is nought"
13954,BOOK XVII.,More wretched than th’ unhappy race of man.
13955,BOOK XVII.,"Yet shall not ye, nor shall your well-wrought car,"
13956,BOOK XVII.,"By Hector, son of Priam, be controll’d;"
13957,BOOK XVII.,I will not suffer it; enough for him
13958,BOOK XVII.,"To hold, with vaunting boast, Achilles’ arms;"
13959,BOOK XVII.,But to your limbs and spirits will I impart
13960,BOOK XVII.,"Such strength, that from the battle to the ships"
13961,BOOK XVII.,Ye shall in safety bear Automedon;
13962,BOOK XVII.,"For yet I will the Trojans shall prevail,"
13963,BOOK XVII.,"And slay, until they reach the well-mann’d ships,"
13964,BOOK XVII.,"Till sets the sun, and darkness shrouds the earth.”"
13965,BOOK XVII.,
13966,BOOK XVII.,"He said, and in their breasts fresh spirit infus’d;"
13967,BOOK XVII.,"They, shaking from their manes the dust, the car"
13968,BOOK XVII.,Amid the Greeks and Trojans lightly bore.
13969,BOOK XVII.,"Then, as a vulture ’mid a flock of geese,"
13970,BOOK XVII.,"Amid the battle rush’d Automedon,"
13971,BOOK XVII.,"His horses’ course directing, and their speed"
13972,BOOK XVII.,"Exciting, though he mourn’d his comrade slain."
13973,BOOK XVII.,Swiftly he fled from out the Trojan host;
13974,BOOK XVII.,Swiftly again assail’d them in pursuit;
13975,BOOK XVII.,"Yet, speedy to pursue, he could not slay;"
13976,BOOK XVII.,"Nor, in the car alone, had pow’r at once"
13977,BOOK XVII.,"To guide the flying steeds, and hurl the spear."
13978,BOOK XVII.,"At length a comrade brave, Alcimedon,"
13979,BOOK XVII.,"Laerces’ son, beheld; behind the car"
13980,BOOK XVII.,"He stood, and thus Automedon address’d:"
13981,BOOK XVII.,"“Automedon, what God has fill’d thy mind"
13982,BOOK XVII.,"With counsels vain, and thee of sense bereft?"
13983,BOOK XVII.,"That with the Trojans, in the foremost ranks,"
13984,BOOK XVII.,"Thou fain wouldst fight alone, thy comrade slain,"
13985,BOOK XVII.,While Hector proudly on his breast displays
13986,BOOK XVII.,The glorious arms of great Æacides.”
13987,BOOK XVII.,
13988,BOOK XVII.,"To whom Automedon, Diores’ son:"
13989,BOOK XVII.,"“Alcimedon, since none of all the Greeks"
13990,BOOK XVII.,"May vie with thee, the mettle to control"
13991,BOOK XVII.,"Of these immortal horses, save indeed,"
13992,BOOK XVII.,"While yet he liv’d, Patroclus, godlike chief;"
13993,BOOK XVII.,But him stern death and fate have overta’en;
13994,BOOK XVII.,"Take thou the whip and shining reins, while I,"
13995,BOOK XVII.,"Descending from the car, engage in fight.”"
13996,BOOK XVII.,
13997,BOOK XVII.,"He said; and, mounting on the war-car straight,"
13998,BOOK XVII.,Alcimedon the whip and reins assum’d;
13999,BOOK XVII.,"Down leap’d Automedon; great Hector saw,"
14000,BOOK XVII.,And thus address’d Æneas at his side:
14001,BOOK XVII.,
14002,BOOK XVII.,"“Æneas, prince and counsellor of Troy,"
14003,BOOK XVII.,"I see, committed to unskilful hands,"
14004,BOOK XVII.,Achilles’ horses on the battle-field:
14005,BOOK XVII.,"These we may hope to take, if such thy will;"
14006,BOOK XVII.,"For they, methinks, will scarcely stand oppos’d,"
14007,BOOK XVII.,Or dare th’ encounter of our joint assault.”
14008,BOOK XVII.,
14009,BOOK XVII.,He said; Anchises’ valiant son complied;
14010,BOOK XVII.,"Forward they went, their shoulders cover’d o’er"
14011,BOOK XVII.,"With stout bull’s-hide, thick overlaid with brass."
14012,BOOK XVII.,With them both Chromius and Aretus went;
14013,BOOK XVII.,
14014,BOOK XVII.,"And high their hopes were rais’d, the warriors both"
14015,BOOK XVII.,"To slay, and make the strong-neck’d steeds their prize:"
14016,BOOK XVII.,Blind fools! nor destin’d scatheless to escape
14017,BOOK XVII.,Automedon’s encounter; he his pray’r
14018,BOOK XVII.,"To Jove address’d, and straight with added strength"
14019,BOOK XVII.,"His soul was fill’d; and to Alcimedon,"
14020,BOOK XVII.,"His trusty friend and comrade, thus he spoke:"
14021,BOOK XVII.,
14022,BOOK XVII.,"“Alcimedon, do thou the horses keep"
14023,BOOK XVII.,"Not far away, but breathing on my neck;"
14024,BOOK XVII.,"For Hector’s might will not, I deem, be stay’d,"
14025,BOOK XVII.,"Ere us he slay, and mount Achilles’ car,"
14026,BOOK XVII.,"And carry terror ’mid the Grecian host,"
14027,BOOK XVII.,Or in the foremost ranks himself be slain.”
14028,BOOK XVII.,
14029,BOOK XVII.,"Thus spoke Automedon, and loudly call’d"
14030,BOOK XVII.,On Menelaus and th’ Ajaces both:
14031,BOOK XVII.,"“Ye two Ajaces, leaders of the host,"
14032,BOOK XVII.,"And, Menelaus, with our bravest all,"
14033,BOOK XVII.,"Ye on the dead alone your care bestow,"
14034,BOOK XVII.,"To guard him, and stave off the hostile ranks;"
14035,BOOK XVII.,"But haste, and us, the living, save from death;"
14036,BOOK XVII.,"For Hector and Æneas hitherward,"
14037,BOOK XVII.,"With weight o’erpow’ring, through the bloody press,"
14038,BOOK XVII.,"The bravest of the Trojans, force their way:"
14039,BOOK XVII.,Yet is the issue in the hands of Heav’n;
14040,BOOK XVII.,"I hurl the spear, but Jove directs the blow.”"
14041,BOOK XVII.,
14042,BOOK XVII.,"He said, and, poising, hurl’d the pond’rous spear;"
14043,BOOK XVII.,Full on Aretus’ broad-orb’d shield it struck;
14044,BOOK XVII.,Nor stay’d the shield its course; the brazen point
14045,BOOK XVII.,"Drove through the belt, and in his body lodg’d."
14046,BOOK XVII.,"As with sharp axe in hand a stalwart man,"
14047,BOOK XVII.,"Striking behind the horns a sturdy bull,"
14048,BOOK XVII.,"Severs the neck; he, forward, plunging, falls;"
14049,BOOK XVII.,"So forward first he sprang, then backwards fell:"
14050,BOOK XVII.,"And quiv’ring, in his vitals deep infix’d,"
14051,BOOK XVII.,The sharp spear soon relax’d his limbs in death.
14052,BOOK XVII.,Then at Automedon great Hector threw
14053,BOOK XVII.,"His glitt’ring spear; he saw, and forward stoop’d,"
14054,BOOK XVII.,And shunn’d the brazen death; behind him far
14055,BOOK XVII.,"Deep in the soil infix’d, with quiv’ring shaft"
14056,BOOK XVII.,The weapon stood; there Mars its impulse stay’d.
14057,BOOK XVII.,"And now with swords, and hand to hand, the fight"
14058,BOOK XVII.,Had been renew’d; but at their comrade’s call
14059,BOOK XVII.,"The two Ajaces, pressing through the throng,"
14060,BOOK XVII.,Between the warriors interpos’d in haste.
14061,BOOK XVII.,"Before them Hector and Æneas both,"
14062,BOOK XVII.,"And godlike Chromius, in alarm recoil’d;"
14063,BOOK XVII.,"Pierc’d through the heart, Aretus there they left;"
14064,BOOK XVII.,"And, terrible as Mars, Automedon"
14065,BOOK XVII.,"Stripp’d off his arms, and thus exulting cried:"
14066,BOOK XVII.,"“Of some small portion of its load of grief,"
14067,BOOK XVII.,"For slain Patroclus, is my heart reliev’d,"
14068,BOOK XVII.,"In slaying thee, all worthless as thou art.”"
14069,BOOK XVII.,
14070,BOOK XVII.,"Then, throwing on the car the bloody spoils,"
14071,BOOK XVII.,"He mounted, hands and feet imbrued with blood,"
14072,BOOK XVII.,"As ’twere a lion, fresh from his repast"
14073,BOOK XVII.,Upon the carcase of a slaughter’d bull.
14074,BOOK XVII.,
14075,BOOK XVII.,Again around Patroclus’ body rag’d
14076,BOOK XVII.,"The stubborn conflict, direful, sorrow-fraught:"
14077,BOOK XVII.,"From Heav’n descending, Pallas stirr’d the strife,"
14078,BOOK XVII.,Sent by all-seeing Jove to stimulate
14079,BOOK XVII.,The warlike Greeks; so changed was now his will.
14080,BOOK XVII.,As o’er the face of Heav’n when Jove extends
14081,BOOK XVII.,"His bright-hued bow, a sign to mortal men"
14082,BOOK XVII.,"Of war, or wintry storms, which bid surcease"
14083,BOOK XVII.,"The rural works of man, and pinch the flocks;"
14084,BOOK XVII.,"So Pallas, in a bright-hued cloud array’d,"
14085,BOOK XVII.,"Pass’d through the ranks, and rous’d each sev’ral man."
14086,BOOK XVII.,"To noble Menelaus, Atreus’ son,"
14087,BOOK XVII.,"Who close beside her stood, the Goddess first,"
14088,BOOK XVII.,The form of Phoenix and his pow’rful voice
14089,BOOK XVII.,"Assuming, thus her stirring words address’d:"
14090,BOOK XVII.,
14091,BOOK XVII.,"“On thee, O Menelaus, foul reproach"
14092,BOOK XVII.,"Will fasten, if Achilles’ faithful friend"
14093,BOOK XVII.,The dogs devour beneath the walls of Troy;
14094,BOOK XVII.,"Then hold thou firm, and all the host inspire.”"
14095,BOOK XVII.,
14096,BOOK XVII.,"To whom thus Menelaus, good in fight:"
14097,BOOK XVII.,"“O Phoenix, aged warrior, honour’d sire,"
14098,BOOK XVII.,"If Pallas would the needful pow’r impart,"
14099,BOOK XVII.,"And o’er me spread her aegis, then would I"
14100,BOOK XVII.,"Undaunted for Patroclus’ rescue fight,"
14101,BOOK XVII.,For deeply by his death my heart is touch’d;
14102,BOOK XVII.,"But valiant Hector, with the strength of fire"
14103,BOOK XVII.,"Still rages, and destruction deals around:"
14104,BOOK XVII.,"For Jove is with him, and his triumph wills.”"
14105,BOOK XVII.,
14106,BOOK XVII.,He said: the blue-ey’d Goddess heard with joy
14107,BOOK XVII.,"That, chief of all the Gods, her aid he sought."
14108,BOOK XVII.,"She gave fresh vigour to his arms and knees,"
14109,BOOK XVII.,"And to his breast the boldness of the fly,"
14110,BOOK XVII.,"Which, oft repell’d by man, renews th’ assault"
14111,BOOK XVII.,"Incessant, lur’d by taste of human blood;"
14112,BOOK XVII.,Such boldness in Atrides’ manly breast
14113,BOOK XVII.,Pallas inspir’d: beside Patroclus’ corpse
14114,BOOK XVII.,"Again he stood, and pois’d his glitt’ring spear."
14115,BOOK XVII.,
14116,BOOK XVII.,"There was one Podes in the Trojan ranks,"
14117,BOOK XVII.,"Son of Eetion, rich, of blameless life,"
14118,BOOK XVII.,"Of all the people most to Hector dear,"
14119,BOOK XVII.,And at his table oft a welcome guest:
14120,BOOK XVII.,"Him, as he turn’d to fly, beneath the waist"
14121,BOOK XVII.,Atrides struck; right through the spear was driv’n;
14122,BOOK XVII.,Thund’ring he fell; and Atreus’ son the corpse
14123,BOOK XVII.,Dragg’d from the Trojans ’mid the ranks of Greece.
14124,BOOK XVII.,
14125,BOOK XVII.,"Then close at Hector’s side Apollo stood,"
14126,BOOK XVII.,"Clad in the form of Phaenops, Asius’ son,"
14127,BOOK XVII.,Who in Abydos dwelt; of all th’ Allies
14128,BOOK XVII.,"Honour’d of Hector most, and best belov’d;"
14129,BOOK XVII.,"Clad in his form, the Far-destroyer spoke:"
14130,BOOK XVII.,
14131,BOOK XVII.,"“Hector, what other Greek will scare thee next?"
14132,BOOK XVII.,"Who shrink’st from Menelaus, heretofore"
14133,BOOK XVII.,"A warrior deem’d of no repute; but now,"
14134,BOOK XVII.,"Alone, he robs our Trojans of their dead;"
14135,BOOK XVII.,And in the foremost ranks e’en now hath slain
14136,BOOK XVII.,"Podes, thine own good friend, Eetion’s son.”"
14137,BOOK XVII.,
14138,BOOK XVII.,"He said; dark grief o’erclouded Hector’s brow,"
14139,BOOK XVII.,As to the front in dazzling arms he sprang.
14140,BOOK XVII.,"Then Saturn’s son his tassell’d aegis wav’d,"
14141,BOOK XVII.,All glitt’ring bright; and Ida’s lofty head
14142,BOOK XVII.,In clouds and darkness shrouded; then he bade
14143,BOOK XVII.,"His lightning flash, his volleying thunder roar,"
14144,BOOK XVII.,That shook the mountain; and with vict’ry crown’d
14145,BOOK XVII.,"The Trojan arms, and panic-struck the Greeks."
14146,BOOK XVII.,
14147,BOOK XVII.,"The first who turn’d to fly was Peneleus,"
14148,BOOK XVII.,"Bœotian chief; him, facing still the foe,"
14149,BOOK XVII.,"A spear had slightly on the shoulder struck,"
14150,BOOK XVII.,"The bone just grazing: by Polydamas,"
14151,BOOK XVII.,"Who close before him stood, the spear was thrown."
14152,BOOK XVII.,"Then Hector Leitus, Aloctryon’s son,"
14153,BOOK XVII.,"Thrust thro’ the wrist, and quell’d his warlike might;"
14154,BOOK XVII.,"Trembling, he look’d around, nor hop’d again"
14155,BOOK XVII.,"The Trojans, spear in hand, to meet in fight;"
14156,BOOK XVII.,"But, onward as he rush’d on Leitus,"
14157,BOOK XVII.,Idomeneus at Hector threw his spear:
14158,BOOK XVII.,Full on his breast it struck; but near the head
14159,BOOK XVII.,The sturdy shaft was on the breastplate snapp’d:
14160,BOOK XVII.,Loud was the Trojans’ shout; and he in turn
14161,BOOK XVII.,"Aim’d at Idomeneus, Deucalion’s son,"
14162,BOOK XVII.,"Upstanding on his car; his mark he miss’d,"
14163,BOOK XVII.,"But Coeranus he struck, the charioteer"
14164,BOOK XVII.,"And faithful follower of Meriones,"
14165,BOOK XVII.,Who with him came from Lyctus’ thriving town:
14166,BOOK XVII.,The chief had left on foot the well-trimm’d ships;
14167,BOOK XVII.,"And, had not Coeranus his car in haste"
14168,BOOK XVII.,"Driv’n to the rescue, by his fall had giv’n"
14169,BOOK XVII.,A Trojan triumph; to his Lord he brought
14170,BOOK XVII.,"Safety, and rescue from unsparing death;"
14171,BOOK XVII.,"But fell, himself, by Hector’s murd’rous hand."
14172,BOOK XVII.,"Him Hector struck between the cheek and ear,"
14173,BOOK XVII.,"Crashing the teeth, and cutting through the tongue."
14174,BOOK XVII.,"Headlong he fell to earth, and dropp’d the reins:"
14175,BOOK XVII.,"These, stooping from the car, Meriones"
14176,BOOK XVII.,"Caught up, and thus Idomeneus address’d:"
14177,BOOK XVII.,
14178,BOOK XVII.,"“Ply now the lash, until thou reach the ships:"
14179,BOOK XVII.,Thyself must see how crush’d the strength of Greece.”
14180,BOOK XVII.,
14181,BOOK XVII.,He said; and tow’rd the ships Idomeneus
14182,BOOK XVII.,Urg’d his fleet steeds; for fear was on his soul.
14183,BOOK XVII.,Nor did not Ajax and Atrides see
14184,BOOK XVII.,How in the Trojans’ favour Saturn’s son
14185,BOOK XVII.,The wav’ring scale of vict’ry turn’d; and thus
14186,BOOK XVII.,Great Ajax Telamon his grief express’d:
14187,BOOK XVII.,
14188,BOOK XVII.,“O Heav’n! the veriest child might plainly see
14189,BOOK XVII.,That Jove the Trojans’ triumph has decreed:
14190,BOOK XVII.,"Their weapons all, by whomsoever thrown,"
14191,BOOK XVII.,"Or weak, or strong, attain their mark; for Jove"
14192,BOOK XVII.,Directs their course; while ours upon the plain
14193,BOOK XVII.,Innocuous fall. But take we counsel now
14194,BOOK XVII.,"How from the fray to bear away our dead,"
14195,BOOK XVII.,And by our own return rejoice those friends
14196,BOOK XVII.,"Who look with sorrow on our plight, and deem"
14197,BOOK XVII.,"That we, all pow’rless to resist the might"
14198,BOOK XVII.,"Of Hector’s arm, beside the ships must fall."
14199,BOOK XVII.,"Would that some comrade were at hand, to bear"
14200,BOOK XVII.,"A message to Achilles; him, I ween,"
14201,BOOK XVII.,"As yet the mournful tidings have not reach’d,"
14202,BOOK XVII.,That on the field his dearest friend lies dead.
14203,BOOK XVII.,But such I see not; for a veil of cloud
14204,BOOK XVII.,O’er men and horses all around is spread.
14205,BOOK XVII.,"O Father Jove, from, o’er the sons of Greece"
14206,BOOK XVII.,"Remove this cloudy darkness; clear the sky,"
14207,BOOK XVII.,"That we may see our fate, and die at least,"
14208,BOOK XVII.,"If such thy will, in th’ open light of day.”"
14209,BOOK XVII.,
14210,BOOK XVII.,"He said, and, pitying, Jove beheld his tears;"
14211,BOOK XVII.,"The clouds he scatter’d, and the mist dispers’d;"
14212,BOOK XVII.,"The sun shone forth, and all the field was clear;"
14213,BOOK XVII.,Then Ajax thus to Menelaus spoke:
14214,BOOK XVII.,
14215,BOOK XVII.,"“Now, Heav’n-born Menelaus, look around"
14216,BOOK XVII.,If haply ’mid the living thou mayst see
14217,BOOK XVII.,"Antilochus, the noble Nestor’s son;"
14218,BOOK XVII.,And bid him to Achilles bear in haste
14219,BOOK XVII.,"The tidings, that his dearest friend lies dead.”"
14220,BOOK XVII.,
14221,BOOK XVII.,"He said, nor did Atrides not comply;"
14222,BOOK XVII.,"But slow as moves a lion from the fold,"
14223,BOOK XVII.,"Which dogs and youths with ceaseless toil hath worn,"
14224,BOOK XVII.,"Who all night long have kept their watch, to guard"
14225,BOOK XVII.,From his assault the choicest of the herd;
14226,BOOK XVII.,"He, hunger-pinch’d, hath oft th’ attempt renew’d,"
14227,BOOK XVII.,"But nought prevail’d; by spears on ev’ry side,"
14228,BOOK XVII.,"And jav’lins met, wielded by stalwart hands,"
14229,BOOK XVII.,"And blazing torches, which his courage daunt;"
14230,BOOK XVII.,Till with the morn he sullenly withdraws;
14231,BOOK XVII.,"So from Patroclus, with reluctant step"
14232,BOOK XVII.,Atrides mov’d; for much he fear’d the Greeks
14233,BOOK XVII.,"Might to the Trojans, panic-struck, the dead"
14234,BOOK XVII.,"Abandon; and departing, he besought"
14235,BOOK XVII.,The two Ajaces and Meriones:
14236,BOOK XVII.,"“Ye two Ajaces, leaders of the Greeks,"
14237,BOOK XVII.,"And thou, Meriones, remember now"
14238,BOOK XVII.,"Our lost Patroclus’ gentle courtesy,"
14239,BOOK XVII.,"How kind and genial was his soul to all,"
14240,BOOK XVII.,"While yet he liv’d—now sunk, alas! in death.”"
14241,BOOK XVII.,
14242,BOOK XVII.,"Thus saying, Menelaus took his way,"
14243,BOOK XVII.,"Casting his glance around on ev’ry side,"
14244,BOOK XVII.,"Like to an eagle, fam’d of sharpest sight"
14245,BOOK XVII.,Of all that fly beneath the vault of Heav’n;
14246,BOOK XVII.,"Whom, soaring in the clouds, the crouching hare"
14247,BOOK XVII.,"Eludes not, though in leafiest covert hid;"
14248,BOOK XVII.,"But swooping down, he rends her life away:"
14249,BOOK XVII.,"So, Menelaus, through the ranks of war"
14250,BOOK XVII.,"Thy piercing glances ev’ry way were turn’d,"
14251,BOOK XVII.,"If Nestor’s son, alive, thou mightst descry;"
14252,BOOK XVII.,"Him on the field’s extremest left he found,"
14253,BOOK XVII.,"Cheering his friends, and urging to the fight;"
14254,BOOK XVII.,"He stood beside him, and address’d him thus:"
14255,BOOK XVII.,
14256,BOOK XVII.,"“Antilochus, come hither, godlike friend,"
14257,BOOK XVII.,"And woful tidings hear, which would to Heav’n"
14258,BOOK XVII.,I had not to impart; thyself thou seest
14259,BOOK XVII.,"How Jove hath heap’d disaster on the Greeks,"
14260,BOOK XVII.,"And vict’ry giv’n to Troy; but one has fallen,"
14261,BOOK XVII.,"Our bravest, best! Patroclus lies in death;"
14262,BOOK XVII.,And deeply must the Greeks his loss deplore.
14263,BOOK XVII.,"But haste thee to the ships, to Peleus’ son"
14264,BOOK XVII.,"The tidings bear, if haply he may save"
14265,BOOK XVII.,The body of Patroclus from the foe;
14266,BOOK XVII.,"His naked body, for his arms are now"
14267,BOOK XVII.,The prize of Hector of the glancing helm.”
14268,BOOK XVII.,
14269,BOOK XVII.,He said; and at his words Antilochus
14270,BOOK XVII.,Astounded stood; long time his tongue in vain
14271,BOOK XVII.,"For utt’rance strove; his eyes were fill’d with tears,"
14272,BOOK XVII.,His cheerful voice was mute; yet not the less
14273,BOOK XVII.,To Menelaus’ bidding gave his care:
14274,BOOK XVII.,"Swiftly he sped; but to Laodocus,"
14275,BOOK XVII.,"His comrade brave, who waited with his car"
14276,BOOK XVII.,"In close attendance, first consign’d his arms;"
14277,BOOK XVII.,"Then from the field with active limbs he flew,"
14278,BOOK XVII.,"Weeping, with mournful news, to Peleus’ son."
14279,BOOK XVII.,"Nor, noble Menelaus, did thy heart"
14280,BOOK XVII.,"Incline thee to remain, and aid thy friends,"
14281,BOOK XVII.,Where from their war-worn ranks the Pylian troops
14282,BOOK XVII.,Deplor’d the absence of Antilochus;
14283,BOOK XVII.,But these in godlike Thrasymedes’ charge
14284,BOOK XVII.,"He left; and to Patroclus hast’ning back,"
14285,BOOK XVII.,"Beside th’ Ajaces stood, as thus he spoke:"
14286,BOOK XVII.,"“Him to Achilles, to the ships, in haste"
14287,BOOK XVII.,I have despatch’d; yet fiercely as his wrath
14288,BOOK XVII.,"May burn tow’rd Hector, I can scarce expect"
14289,BOOK XVII.,"His presence here; for how could he, unarm’d,"
14290,BOOK XVII.,With Trojans fight? But take we counsel now
14291,BOOK XVII.,"How from the field to bear away our dead,"
14292,BOOK XVII.,And ’scape ourselves from death by Trojan hands.”
14293,BOOK XVII.,
14294,BOOK XVII.,Whom answer’d thus great Ajax Telamon:
14295,BOOK XVII.,"“Illustrious Menelaus, all thy words"
14296,BOOK XVII.,"Are just and true; then from amid the press,"
14297,BOOK XVII.,"Thou and Meriones, take up in haste,"
14298,BOOK XVII.,And bear away the body; while behind
14299,BOOK XVII.,"We two, in heart united, as in name,"
14300,BOOK XVII.,"Who side by side have still been wont to fight,"
14301,BOOK XVII.,Will Hector and his Trojans hold at bay.”
14302,BOOK XVII.,
14303,BOOK XVII.,"He said; they, lifting in their arms the corpse,"
14304,BOOK XVII.,Uprais’d it high in air; then from behind
14305,BOOK XVII.,"Loud yell’d the Trojans, as they saw the Greeks"
14306,BOOK XVII.,"Retiring with their dead; and on they rush’d,"
14307,BOOK XVII.,As dogs that in advance of hunter youths
14308,BOOK XVII.,"Pursue a wounded boar; awhile they run,"
14309,BOOK XVII.,"Eager for blood; but when, in pride of strength,"
14310,BOOK XVII.,"He turns upon them, backward they recoil,"
14311,BOOK XVII.,This way and that in fear of death dispers’d:
14312,BOOK XVII.,"So onward press’d awhile the Trojan crowd,"
14313,BOOK XVII.,"With thrust of swords, and double-pointed spears;"
14314,BOOK XVII.,"But ever as th’ Ajaces turn’d to bay,"
14315,BOOK XVII.,"Their colour chang’d to pale, not one so bold"
14316,BOOK XVII.,"As, dashing on, to battle for the corpse."
14317,BOOK XVII.,"Thus they, with anxious care, from off the field"
14318,BOOK XVII.,Bore tow’rd the ships their dead; but on their track
14319,BOOK XVII.,"Came sweeping on the storm of battle, fierce,"
14320,BOOK XVII.,"As, on a sudden breaking forth, the fire"
14321,BOOK XVII.,"Seizes some populous city, and devours"
14322,BOOK XVII.,"House after house amid the glare and blaze,"
14323,BOOK XVII.,While roar the flames before the gusty wind;
14324,BOOK XVII.,So fiercely pressed upon the Greeks’ retreat
14325,BOOK XVII.,The clatt’ring tramp of steeds and armed men.
14326,BOOK XVII.,"But as the mules, with stubborn strength endued,"
14327,BOOK XVII.,That down the mountain through the trackless waste
14328,BOOK XVII.,"Drag some huge log, or timber for the ships;"
14329,BOOK XVII.,"And spent with toil and sweat, still labour on"
14330,BOOK XVII.,Unflinching; so the Greeks with patient toil
14331,BOOK XVII.,Bore on their dead; th’ Ajaces in their rear
14332,BOOK XVII.,"Stemming the war, as stems the torrent’s force"
14333,BOOK XVII.,"Some wooded cliff, far stretching o’er the plain;"
14334,BOOK XVII.,"Checking the mighty river’s rushing stream,"
14335,BOOK XVII.,"And flinging it aside upon the plain,"
14336,BOOK XVII.,Itself unbroken by the strength of flood:
14337,BOOK XVII.,"So firmly, in the rear, th’ Ajaces stemm’d"
14338,BOOK XVII.,"The Trojan force; yet these still onward press’d,"
14339,BOOK XVII.,"And, ’mid their comrades proudly eminent,"
14340,BOOK XVII.,"Two chiefs, Æneas, old Anchises’ son,"
14341,BOOK XVII.,"And glorious Hector, in the van were seen."
14342,BOOK XVII.,"Then, as a cloud of starlings or of daws"
14343,BOOK XVII.,"Fly screaming, as they see the hawk approach,"
14344,BOOK XVII.,To lesser birds the messenger of death;
14345,BOOK XVII.,"So before Hector and Æneas fled,"
14346,BOOK XVII.,"Screaming, forgetful of their warlike fame,"
14347,BOOK XVII.,The sons of Greece; and scatter’d here and there
14348,BOOK XVII.,"Around the ditch lay store of goodly arms,"
14349,BOOK XVII.,By Greeks abandon’d in their hasty flight.
14350,BOOK XVII.,"Yet still, unintermitted, rag’d the war."

14400,BOOK XVIII.,"And weeping, thus his mournful message gave:"
14401,BOOK XVIII.,
14402,BOOK XVIII.,"“Alas! great son of Peleus, woful news,"
14403,BOOK XVIII.,"Which would to Heav’n I had not to impart,"
14404,BOOK XVIII.,To thee I bring; Patroclus lies in death;

14406,BOOK XVIII.,"His naked body, for his arms are now"
14407,BOOK XVIII.,The prize of Hector of the glancing helm.”
14408,BOOK XVIII.,
14409,BOOK XVIII.,He said; and darkest clouds of grief o’erspread
14410,BOOK XVIII.,Achilles’ brow; with both his hands he seiz’d
14411,BOOK XVIII.,"And pour’d upon his head the grimy dust,"
14412,BOOK XVIII.,Marring his graceful visage; and defil’d
14413,BOOK XVIII.,With black’ning ashes all his costly robes.
14414,BOOK XVIII.,"Stretch’d in the dust his lofty stature lay,"
14415,BOOK XVIII.,As with his hands his flowing locks he tore;
14416,BOOK XVIII.,"Loud was the wailing of the female band,"
14417,BOOK XVIII.,"Achilles’ and Patroclus’ prize of war,"
14418,BOOK XVIII.,"As round Achilles, rushing out of doors,"
14419,BOOK XVIII.,"Beating their breasts, with tott’ring limbs they press’d."

14435,BOOK XVIII.,And all the denizens of ocean’s depths.
14436,BOOK XVIII.,Fill’d was the glassy cave; in unison
14437,BOOK XVIII.,"They beat their breasts, as Thetis led the wail:"
14438,BOOK XVIII.,
14439,BOOK XVIII.,"“Give ear, my sister Nereids all, and learn"

14447,BOOK XVIII.,"To war with Troy; him ne’er shall I behold,"
14448,BOOK XVIII.,"Returning home, in aged Peleus’ house."
14449,BOOK XVIII.,"E’en while he lives, and sees the light of day,"
14450,BOOK XVIII.,"He lives in sorrow; nor, to soothe his grief,"
14451,BOOK XVIII.,"My presence can avail; yet will I go,"
14452,BOOK XVIII.,"That I may see my dearest child, and learn"

14454,BOOK XVIII.,
14455,BOOK XVIII.,"She said, and left the cave; with her they went,"
14456,BOOK XVIII.,Weeping; before them parted th’ ocean wave.
14457,BOOK XVIII.,"But when they reach’d the fertile shore of Troy,"
14458,BOOK XVIII.,"In order due they landed on the beach,"
14459,BOOK XVIII.,"Where frequent, round Achilles swift of foot,"
14460,BOOK XVIII.,Were moor’d the vessels of the Myrmidons.
14461,BOOK XVIII.,"There, as he groan’d aloud, beside him stood"
14462,BOOK XVIII.,"His Goddess-mother; weeping, in her hands"
14463,BOOK XVIII.,"She held his head, while pitying thus she spoke:"
14464,BOOK XVIII.,
14465,BOOK XVIII.,“Why weeps my son? and what his cause of grief?
14466,BOOK XVIII.,"Speak out, and nought conceal; for all thy pray’r"
14467,BOOK XVIII.,"Which with uplifted hands thou mad’st to Jove,"
14468,BOOK XVIII.,"He hath fulfill’d, that, flying to their ships,"
14469,BOOK XVIII.,The routed sons of Greece should feel how much
14470,BOOK XVIII.,"They need thine aid, and mourn their insult past.”"
14471,BOOK XVIII.,
14472,BOOK XVIII.,"To whom Achilles, deeply groaning, thus:"
14473,BOOK XVIII.,"“Mother, all this indeed hath Jove fulfill’d;"
14474,BOOK XVIII.,"Yet what avails it, since my dearest friend"
14475,BOOK XVIII.,"Is slain, Patroclus? whom I honour’d most"
14476,BOOK XVIII.,"Of all my comrades, lov’d him as my soul."
14477,BOOK XVIII.,Him have I lost: and Hector from his corpse
14478,BOOK XVIII.,"Hath stripp’d those arms, those weighty, beauteous arms,"
14479,BOOK XVIII.,"A marvel to behold, which from the Gods"
14480,BOOK XVIII.,"Peleus receiv’d, a glorious gift, that day"
14481,BOOK XVIII.,When they consign’d thee to a mortal’s bed.
14482,BOOK XVIII.,"How better were it, if thy lot had been"
14483,BOOK XVIII.,"Still ’mid the Ocean deities to dwell,"
14484,BOOK XVIII.,And Peleus had espous’d a mortal bride!
14485,BOOK XVIII.,"For now is bitter grief for thee in store,"
14486,BOOK XVIII.,Mourning thy son; whom to his home return’d
14487,BOOK XVIII.,Thou never more shalt see; nor would I wish
14488,BOOK XVIII.,"To live, and move amid my fellow-men,"
14489,BOOK XVIII.,"Unless that Hector, vanquish’d by my spear,"
14490,BOOK XVIII.,"May lose his forfeit life, and pay the price"
14491,BOOK XVIII.,Of foul dishonour to Patroclus done.”
14492,BOOK XVIII.,
14493,BOOK XVIII.,"To whom, her tears o’erflowing, Thetis thus:"
14494,BOOK XVIII.,"“E’en as thou sayst, my son, thy term is short;"
14495,BOOK XVIII.,Nor long shall Hector’s fate precede thine own.”
14496,BOOK XVIII.,
14497,BOOK XVIII.,"Achilles, answ’ring, spoke in passionate grief:"
14498,BOOK XVIII.,"“Would I might die this hour, who fail’d to save"
14499,BOOK XVIII.,My comrade slain! far from his native land
14500,BOOK XVIII.,"He died, sore needing my protecting arm;"
14501,BOOK XVIII.,"And I, who ne’er again must see my home,"
14502,BOOK XVIII.,"Nor to Patroclus, nor the many Greeks"
14503,BOOK XVIII.,"Whom Hector’s hand hath slain, have render’d aid;"
14504,BOOK XVIII.,"But idly here I sit, cumb’ring the ground:"
14505,BOOK XVIII.,"I, who amid the Greeks no equal own"
14506,BOOK XVIII.,"In fight; to others, in debate, I yield."
14507,BOOK XVIII.,Accurs’d of Gods and men be hateful strife
14508,BOOK XVIII.,"And anger, which to violence provokes"
14509,BOOK XVIII.,E’en temp’rate souls: though sweeter be its taste
14510,BOOK XVIII.,"Than dropping honey, in the heart of man"
14511,BOOK XVIII.,"Swelling, like smoke; such anger in my soul"
14512,BOOK XVIII.,"Hath Agamemnon kindled, King of men."
14513,BOOK XVIII.,"But pass we that; though still my heart be sore,"
14514,BOOK XVIII.,Yet will I school my angry spirit down.
14515,BOOK XVIII.,"In search of Hector now, of him who slew"
14516,BOOK XVIII.,"My friend, I go; prepar’d to meet my death,"
14517,BOOK XVIII.,"When Jove shall will it, and th’ Immortals all."
14518,BOOK XVIII.,"From death not e’en the might of Hercules,"
14519,BOOK XVIII.,"Though best belov’d of Saturn’s son, could fly,"
14520,BOOK XVIII.,By fate and Juno’s bitter wrath subdued.
14521,BOOK XVIII.,"I too, since such my doom, must lie in death;"
14522,BOOK XVIII.,"Yet, ere I die, immortal fame will win;"
14523,BOOK XVIII.,"And from their delicate cheeks, deep-bosom’d dames,"
14524,BOOK XVIII.,"Dardan and Trojan, bitter tears shall wipe,"
14525,BOOK XVIII.,And groan in anguish; then shall all men know
14526,BOOK XVIII.,How long I have been absent from the field;
14527,BOOK XVIII.,"Then, though thou love me, seek not from the war"
14528,BOOK XVIII.,To stay my steps; for bootless were thy speech.”
14529,BOOK XVIII.,
14530,BOOK XVIII.,Whom answer’d thus the silver-footed Queen:
14531,BOOK XVIII.,"“True are thy words, my son; and good it is,"
14532,BOOK XVIII.,"And commendable, from the stroke of death"
14533,BOOK XVIII.,"To save a worsted comrade; but thine arms,"
14534,BOOK XVIII.,"Thy brazen, flashing arms, the Trojans hold:"
14535,BOOK XVIII.,Them Hector of the glancing helm himself
14536,BOOK XVIII.,"Bears on his breast, exulting; yet not long"
14537,BOOK XVIII.,"Shall be his triumph, for his doom is nigh."
14538,BOOK XVIII.,"But thou, engage not in the toils of war,"
14539,BOOK XVIII.,Until thine eyes again behold me here;
14540,BOOK XVIII.,For with to-morrow’s sun will I return
14541,BOOK XVIII.,"With arms of heav’nly mould, by Vulcan wrought.”"
14542,BOOK XVIII.,
14543,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus saying, from her son she turn’d away,"
14544,BOOK XVIII.,"And turning, to her sister Nereids spoke:"
14545,BOOK XVIII.,“Back to the spacious bosom of the deep
14546,BOOK XVIII.,"Retire ye now; and to my father’s house,"
14547,BOOK XVIII.,"The aged Ocean God, your tidings bear;"
14548,BOOK XVIII.,"While I to high Olympus speed, to crave"
14549,BOOK XVIII.,"At Vulcan’s hand, the skill’d artificer,"
14550,BOOK XVIII.,A boon of dazzling armour for my son.”
14551,BOOK XVIII.,
14552,BOOK XVIII.,She said; and they beneath the ocean wave
14553,BOOK XVIII.,"Descended, while to high Olympus sped"
14554,BOOK XVIII.,"The silver-footed Goddess, thence in hope"
14555,BOOK XVIII.,To bear the dazzling armour to her son.
14556,BOOK XVIII.,She to Olympus sped; the Greeks meanwhile
14557,BOOK XVIII.,Before the warrior-slayer Hector fled
14558,BOOK XVIII.,"With wild, tumultuous uproar, till they reach’d"
14559,BOOK XVIII.,Their vessels and the shore of Hellespont.
14560,BOOK XVIII.,"Nor had the well-greav’d Greeks Achilles’ friend,"
14561,BOOK XVIII.,"Patroclus, from amid the fray withdrawn;"
14562,BOOK XVIII.,"For close upon him follow’d horse and man,"
14563,BOOK XVIII.,"And Hector, son of Priam, fierce as flame;"
14564,BOOK XVIII.,"Thrice noble Hector, seizing from behind,"
14565,BOOK XVIII.,"Sought by the feet to drag away the dead,"
14566,BOOK XVIII.,"Cheering his friends; thrice, clad in warlike might,"
14567,BOOK XVIII.,The two Ajaces drove him from his prey.
14568,BOOK XVIII.,"Yet, fearless in his strength, now rushing on"
14569,BOOK XVIII.,"He dash’d amid the fray; now, shouting loud,"
14570,BOOK XVIII.,Stood firm; but backward not a step retir’d.
14571,BOOK XVIII.,As from a carcase herdsmen strive in vain
14572,BOOK XVIII.,"To scare a tawny lion, hunger-pinch’d;"
14573,BOOK XVIII.,"E’en so th’ Ajaces, mail-clad warriors, fail’d"
14574,BOOK XVIII.,The son of Priam from the corpse to scare.
14575,BOOK XVIII.,"And now the body had he borne away,"
14576,BOOK XVIII.,With endless fame; but from Olympus’ height
14577,BOOK XVIII.,"Came storm-swift Iris down to Peleus’ son,"
14578,BOOK XVIII.,"And bade him don his arms; by Juno sent,"
14579,BOOK XVIII.,"Unknown to Jove, and to th’ Immortals all."
14580,BOOK XVIII.,"She stood beside him, and address’d him thus:"
14581,BOOK XVIII.,
14582,BOOK XVIII.,"“Up, son of Peleus! up, thou prince of men!"
14583,BOOK XVIII.,"Haste to Patroclus’ rescue; whom, around,"
14584,BOOK XVIII.,"Before the ships, is wag’d a fearful war,"
14585,BOOK XVIII.,"With mutual slaughter; these the dead defending,"
14586,BOOK XVIII.,And those to Ilium’s breezy heights intent
14587,BOOK XVIII.,"To bear the body; noble Hector chief,"
14588,BOOK XVIII.,"Who longs to sever from the tender neck,"
14589,BOOK XVIII.,"And fix upon the spikes, thy comrade’s head."
14590,BOOK XVIII.,Up then! delay no longer; deem it shame
14591,BOOK XVIII.,"Patroclus’ corpse should glut the dogs of Troy,"
14592,BOOK XVIII.,"Dishon’ring thee, if aught dishonour him.”"
14593,BOOK XVIII.,
14594,BOOK XVIII.,"Whom answer’d thus Achilles, swift of foot:"
14595,BOOK XVIII.,"“Say, heav’nly Iris, of th’ immortal Gods"
14596,BOOK XVIII.,"Who bade thee seek me, and this message bring?”"
14597,BOOK XVIII.,
14598,BOOK XVIII.,To whom swift Iris thus: “To thee I come
14599,BOOK XVIII.,"By Juno sent, th’ imperial wife of Jove;"
14600,BOOK XVIII.,"Unknown to Saturn’s son, and all the Gods"
14601,BOOK XVIII.,Who on Olympus’ snowy summit dwell.”
14602,BOOK XVIII.,
14603,BOOK XVIII.,"To whom again Achilles, swift of foot:"
14604,BOOK XVIII.,“How in the battle toil can I engage?
14605,BOOK XVIII.,My arms are with the Trojans; and to boot
14606,BOOK XVIII.,"My mother warn’d me not to arm for fight,"
14607,BOOK XVIII.,Till I again should see her; for she hop’d
14608,BOOK XVIII.,To bring me heav’nly arms by Vulcan wrought:
14609,BOOK XVIII.,"Nor know I well whose armour I could wear,"
14610,BOOK XVIII.,Save the broad shield of Ajax Telamon
14611,BOOK XVIII.,"And he, methinks, amid the foremost ranks"
14612,BOOK XVIII.,Ev’n now is fighting o’er Patroclus’ corpse.”
14613,BOOK XVIII.,
14614,BOOK XVIII.,Whom answer’d storm-swift Iris: “Well we know
14615,BOOK XVIII.,Thy glorious arms are by the Trojans held;
14616,BOOK XVIII.,"But go thou forth, and from above the ditch"
14617,BOOK XVIII.,"Appear before them; daunted at the sight,"
14618,BOOK XVIII.,"Haply the Trojans may forsake the field,"
14619,BOOK XVIII.,"And breathing-time afford the sons of Greece,"
14620,BOOK XVIII.,Toil-worn; for little pause has yet been theirs.”
14621,BOOK XVIII.,
14622,BOOK XVIII.,"Swift Iris said, and vanish’d; then uprose"
14623,BOOK XVIII.,"Achilles, dear to Jove; and Pallas threw"
14624,BOOK XVIII.,Her tassell’d aegis o’er his shoulders broad;
14625,BOOK XVIII.,His head encircling with a coronet
14626,BOOK XVIII.,"Of golden cloud, whence fiery flashes gleam’d."
14627,BOOK XVIII.,As from an island city up to Heav’n
14628,BOOK XVIII.,"The smoke ascends, which hostile forces round"
14629,BOOK XVIII.,"Beleaguer, and all day with cruel war"
14630,BOOK XVIII.,From its own state cut off; but when the sun
14631,BOOK XVIII.,"Hath set, blaze frequent forth the beacon fires;"
14632,BOOK XVIII.,"High rise the flames, and to the dwellers round"
14633,BOOK XVIII.,"Their signal flash, if haply o’er the sea"
14634,BOOK XVIII.,May come the needful aid; so brightly flash’d
14635,BOOK XVIII.,That fiery light around Achilles’ head.
14636,BOOK XVIII.,"He left the wall, and stood above the ditch,"
14637,BOOK XVIII.,"But from the Greeks apart, rememb’ring well"
14638,BOOK XVIII.,"His mother’s prudent counsel; there he stood,"
14639,BOOK XVIII.,"And shouted loudly; Pallas join’d her voice,"
14640,BOOK XVIII.,And fill’d with terror all the Trojan host.
14641,BOOK XVIII.,"Clear as the trumpet’s sound, which calls to arms"
14642,BOOK XVIII.,"Some town, encompass’d round with hostile bands,"
14643,BOOK XVIII.,Rang out the voice of great Æacides.
14644,BOOK XVIII.,"But when Achilles’ voice of brass they heard,"
14645,BOOK XVIII.,"They quail’d in spirit; the sleek-skin’d steeds themselves,"
14646,BOOK XVIII.,"Conscious of coming ill, bore back the cars:"
14647,BOOK XVIII.,"Their charioteers, dismay’d, beheld the flame"
14648,BOOK XVIII.,"Which, kindled by the blue-ey’d Goddess, blaz’d"
14649,BOOK XVIII.,Unquench’d around the head of Peleus’ son.
14650,BOOK XVIII.,Thrice shouted from the ditch the godlike chief;
14651,BOOK XVIII.,Thrice terror struck both Trojans and Allies;
14652,BOOK XVIII.,And there and then beside their chariots fell
14653,BOOK XVIII.,"Twelve of their bravest; while the Greeks, well pleas’d,"
14654,BOOK XVIII.,"Patroclus’ body from the fray withdrew,"
14655,BOOK XVIII.,And on a litter laid; around him stood
14656,BOOK XVIII.,"His comrades mourning; with them, Peleus’ son,"
14657,BOOK XVIII.,"Shedding hot tears, as on his friend he gaz’d,"
14658,BOOK XVIII.,"Laid on the bier, and pierc’d with deadly wounds:"
14659,BOOK XVIII.,Him to the war with horses and with cars
14660,BOOK XVIII.,He sent; but ne’er to welcome his return.
14661,BOOK XVIII.,"By stag-ey’d Juno sent, reluctant sank"
14662,BOOK XVIII.,Th’ unwearied sun beneath the ocean wave;
14663,BOOK XVIII.,"The sun had set, and breath’d awhile the Greeks"
14664,BOOK XVIII.,From the fierce labours of the balanc’d field;
14665,BOOK XVIII.,"Nor less the Trojans, from the stubborn fight"
14666,BOOK XVIII.,"Retiring, from the chariots loos’d their steeds:"
14667,BOOK XVIII.,"But ere they shar’d the ev’ning meal, they met"
14668,BOOK XVIII.,In council; all stood up; none dar’d to sit;
14669,BOOK XVIII.,"For fear had fallen on all, when reappear’d"
14670,BOOK XVIII.,"Achilles, from the battle long withdrawn."
14671,BOOK XVIII.,"First Panthous’ son, the sage Polydamas,"
14672,BOOK XVIII.,Address’d th’ assembly; his sagacious mind
14673,BOOK XVIII.,Alone beheld the future and the past;
14674,BOOK XVIII.,"The friend of Hector, born the selfsame night;"
14675,BOOK XVIII.,"One in debate, the other best in arms;"
14676,BOOK XVIII.,"Who thus with prudent speech began, and said:"
14677,BOOK XVIII.,
14678,BOOK XVIII.,"“Be well advis’d, my friends! my counsel is"
14679,BOOK XVIII.,"That we regain the city, nor the morn"
14680,BOOK XVIII.,"Here in the plain, beside the ships, await,"
14681,BOOK XVIII.,So far remov’d from our protecting walls.
14682,BOOK XVIII.,While fiercely burn’d ’gainst Atreus’ godlike son
14683,BOOK XVIII.,"That mighty warrior’s wrath, ’twas easier far"
14684,BOOK XVIII.,With th’ other Greeks to deal; and I rejoic’d
14685,BOOK XVIII.,"When by the ships we pass’d the night, in hopes"
14686,BOOK XVIII.,"We soon might call them ours; but now, I own"
14687,BOOK XVIII.,"Achilles, swift of foot, excites my fear."
14688,BOOK XVIII.,"His proud, impetuous spirit will spurn the plain,"
14689,BOOK XVIII.,Where Greeks and Trojans oft in warlike strife
14690,BOOK XVIII.,"Their balanc’d strength exert; if he come forth,"
14691,BOOK XVIII.,Our fight will be to guard our homes and wives.
14692,BOOK XVIII.,"Gain we the city; trust me, so ’twere best."
14693,BOOK XVIII.,"Now, for a while, ambrosial night detains"
14694,BOOK XVIII.,The son of Peleus; but at early morn
14695,BOOK XVIII.,"If issuing forth in arms he find us here,"
14696,BOOK XVIII.,His prowess we shall know; and happy he
14697,BOOK XVIII.,"Who, flying, shall in safety reach the walls"
14698,BOOK XVIII.,Of sacred Troy; for many a Trojan slain
14699,BOOK XVIII.,Shall feed the vultures; Heav’n avert such fate!
14700,BOOK XVIII.,"But if, though loth, ye will by me be rul’d,"
14701,BOOK XVIII.,This night in council husband we our strength;
14702,BOOK XVIII.,"While tow’rs, and lofty gates, and folding doors"
14703,BOOK XVIII.,"Close join’d, well-fitting, shall our city guard:"
14704,BOOK XVIII.,Then issuing forth in arms at early morn
14705,BOOK XVIII.,Man we the tow’rs; so harder were his task
14706,BOOK XVIII.,"If, from the ships advancing, round the wall"
14707,BOOK XVIII.,"He offer battle; bootless to return,"
14708,BOOK XVIII.,His strong-neck’d horses worn with labour vain
14709,BOOK XVIII.,"In coursing, purposeless, around the town."
14710,BOOK XVIII.,"To force an entrance, or the town destroy,"
14711,BOOK XVIII.,"Is not his aim; and ere that end be gain’d,"
14712,BOOK XVIII.,The dogs of Troy upon his flesh shall feed.”
14713,BOOK XVIII.,
14714,BOOK XVIII.,To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm
14715,BOOK XVIII.,"With stern regard: “Polydamas, thy words"
14716,BOOK XVIII.,"Are such as grate unkindly on mine ear,"
14717,BOOK XVIII.,Who fain wouldst have us to the walls retire.
14718,BOOK XVIII.,What? have ye not already long enough
14719,BOOK XVIII.,"Been coop’d within the tow’rs? the wealth of Troy,"
14720,BOOK XVIII.,"Its brass, its gold, were once the common theme"
14721,BOOK XVIII.,Of ev’ry tongue; our hoarded treasures now
14722,BOOK XVIII.,"Are gone, to Phrygian and Maeonian shores"
14723,BOOK XVIII.,"For sale exported, costly merchandise,"
14724,BOOK XVIII.,Since on our city fell the wrath of Jove.
14725,BOOK XVIII.,"And now, when deep-designing Saturn’s son"
14726,BOOK XVIII.,"Such glory gives me as to gain the ships,"
14727,BOOK XVIII.,"And, crowded by the sea, hem in the Greeks,"
14728,BOOK XVIII.,"Fool! put not thou these timid counsels forth,"
14729,BOOK XVIII.,"Which none will follow, nor will I allow."
14730,BOOK XVIII.,"But hear ye all, and do as I advise:"
14731,BOOK XVIII.,"Share now the meal, by ranks, throughout the host;"
14732,BOOK XVIII.,"Then set your watch, and each keep careful guard;"
14733,BOOK XVIII.,"And whom his spoils o’erload, if such there be,"
14734,BOOK XVIII.,Let him divide them with the gen’ral crowd;
14735,BOOK XVIII.,Better that they should hold them than the Greeks:
14736,BOOK XVIII.,"And with the morn, in arms, beside the ships,"
14737,BOOK XVIII.,Will we again awake the furious war.
14738,BOOK XVIII.,But if indeed Achilles by the ships
14739,BOOK XVIII.,"Hath reappear’d, himself, if so he choose,"
14740,BOOK XVIII.,Shall be the suff’rer; from the perilous strife
14741,BOOK XVIII.,"I will not shrink, but his encounter meet:"
14742,BOOK XVIII.,"So he, or I, shall gain immortal fame;"
14743,BOOK XVIII.,Impartial Mars hath oft the slayer slain.”
14744,BOOK XVIII.,
14745,BOOK XVIII.,Thus Hector spoke; the Trojans cheer’d aloud:
14746,BOOK XVIII.,"Fools, and by Pallas of their sense bereft,"
14747,BOOK XVIII.,"Who all applauded Hector’s ill advice,"
14748,BOOK XVIII.,None the sage counsel of Polydamas!
14749,BOOK XVIII.,Then through the camp they shar’d the ev’ning meal.
14750,BOOK XVIII.,
14751,BOOK XVIII.,Meantime the Greeks all night with tears and groans
14752,BOOK XVIII.,Bewail’d Patroclus: on his comrade’s breast
14753,BOOK XVIII.,"Achilles laid his murder-dealing hands,"
14754,BOOK XVIII.,And led with bitter groans the loud lament.
14755,BOOK XVIII.,"As when the hunters, in the forest’s depth,"
14756,BOOK XVIII.,Have robb’d a bearded lion of his cubs;
14757,BOOK XVIII.,"Too late arriving, he with anger chafes;"
14758,BOOK XVIII.,"Then follows, if perchance he may o’ertake,"
14759,BOOK XVIII.,"Through many a mountain glen, the hunters’ steps,"
14760,BOOK XVIII.,"With grief and fury fill’d; so Peleus’ son,"
14761,BOOK XVIII.,"With bitter groans, the Myrmidons address’d:"
14762,BOOK XVIII.,
14763,BOOK XVIII.,"“Vain was, alas! the promise which I gave,"
14764,BOOK XVIII.,"Seeking the brave Menoetius to console,"
14765,BOOK XVIII.,"To bring to Opus back his gallant son,"
14766,BOOK XVIII.,Rich with his share of spoil from Troy o’erthrown;
14767,BOOK XVIII.,But Jove fulfils not all that man designs:
14768,BOOK XVIII.,"For us hath fate decreed, that here in Troy"
14769,BOOK XVIII.,We two one soil should redden with our blood;
14770,BOOK XVIII.,"Nor me, returning to my native land,"
14771,BOOK XVIII.,"Shall aged Peleus in his halls receive,"
14772,BOOK XVIII.,Nor Thetis; here must earth retain my bones.
14773,BOOK XVIII.,"But since, Patroclus, I am doom’d on earth"
14774,BOOK XVIII.,"Behind thee to remain, thy fun’ral rites"
14775,BOOK XVIII.,"I will not celebrate, till Hector’s arms,"
14776,BOOK XVIII.,"And head, thy haughty slayer’s, here I bring;"
14777,BOOK XVIII.,And on thy pyre twelve noble sons of Troy
14778,BOOK XVIII.,"Will sacrifice, in vengeance of thy death."
14779,BOOK XVIII.,Thou by our beaked ships till then must lie;
14780,BOOK XVIII.,"And weeping o’er thee shall deep-bosom’d dames,"
14781,BOOK XVIII.,"Trojan and Dardan, mourn both night and day;"
14782,BOOK XVIII.,"The prizes of our toil, when wealthy towns"
14783,BOOK XVIII.,Before our valour and our spears have fall’n.”
14784,BOOK XVIII.,
14785,BOOK XVIII.,"He said, and bade his comrades on the fire"
14786,BOOK XVIII.,"An ample tripod place, without delay"
14787,BOOK XVIII.,To cleanse Patroclus from the bloody gore:
14788,BOOK XVIII.,"They on the burning fire the tripod plac’d,"
14789,BOOK XVIII.,"With water fill’d, and kindled wood beneath."
14790,BOOK XVIII.,"Around the bellying tripod rose the flames,"
14791,BOOK XVIII.,Heating the bath; within the glitt’ring brass
14792,BOOK XVIII.,"Soon as the water boil’d, they wash’d the corpse,"
14793,BOOK XVIII.,"With lissom oils anointing, and the wounds"
14794,BOOK XVIII.,"With fragrant ointments fill’d, of nine years old;"
14795,BOOK XVIII.,Then in fine linen they the body wrapp’d
14796,BOOK XVIII.,"From head to feet, and laid it on a couch."
14797,BOOK XVIII.,And cover’d over with a fair white sheet.
14798,BOOK XVIII.,All night around Achilles swift of foot
14799,BOOK XVIII.,The Myrmidons with tears Patroclus mourn’d.
14800,BOOK XVIII.,
14801,BOOK XVIII.,"To Juno then, his sister and his wife,"
14802,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus Saturn’s son: “At length thou hast thy will,"
14803,BOOK XVIII.,"Imperial Juno, who hast stirr’d to war"
14804,BOOK XVIII.,Achilles swift of foot; well might one deem
14805,BOOK XVIII.,These long-hair’d Greeks from thee deriv’d their birth.”
14806,BOOK XVIII.,
14807,BOOK XVIII.,To whom in answer thus the stag-ey’d Queen:
14808,BOOK XVIII.,"“What words, dread son of Saturn, dost thou speak?"
14809,BOOK XVIII.,"E’en man, though mortal, and inferior far"
14810,BOOK XVIII.,"To us in wisdom, might so much effect"
14811,BOOK XVIII.,"Against his fellow-man; then how should I,"
14812,BOOK XVIII.,"By double title chief of Goddesses,"
14813,BOOK XVIII.,"First by my birth, and next because thy wife"
14814,BOOK XVIII.,"I boast me, thine, o’er all the Gods supreme,"
14815,BOOK XVIII.,Not work my vengeance on the Trojan race?”
14816,BOOK XVIII.,
14817,BOOK XVIII.,"Such, converse while they held, to Vulcan’s house,"
14818,BOOK XVIII.,"Immortal, starlike bright, among the Gods"
14819,BOOK XVIII.,"Unrivall’d, all of brass, by Vulcan’s self"
14820,BOOK XVIII.,"Constructed, sped the silver-footed Queen."
14821,BOOK XVIII.,"Him swelt’ring at his forge she found, intent"
14822,BOOK XVIII.,"On forming twenty tripods, which should stand"
14823,BOOK XVIII.,The wall surrounding of his well-built house;
14824,BOOK XVIII.,"With golden wheels beneath he furnish’d each,"
14825,BOOK XVIII.,And to th’ assembly of the Gods endued
14826,BOOK XVIII.,"With pow’r to move spontaneous, and return,"
14827,BOOK XVIII.,A marvel to behold! thus far his work
14828,BOOK XVIII.,He had completed; but not yet had fix’d
14829,BOOK XVIII.,The rich-wrought handles; these his labour now
14830,BOOK XVIII.,"Engag’d, to fit them, and to rivet fast."
14831,BOOK XVIII.,"While thus he exercis’d his practis’d skill,"
14832,BOOK XVIII.,The silver-footed Queen approach’d the house.
14833,BOOK XVIII.,"Charis, the skilful artist’s wedded wife,"
14834,BOOK XVIII.,"Beheld her coming, and advanc’d to meet;"
14835,BOOK XVIII.,"And, as her hand she clasp’d, address’d her thus:"
14836,BOOK XVIII.,
14837,BOOK XVIII.,"“Say, Thetis of the flowing robe, belov’d"
14838,BOOK XVIII.,"And honour’d, whence this visit to our house,"
14839,BOOK XVIII.,"An unaccustom’d guest? but come thou in,"
14840,BOOK XVIII.,That I may welcome thee with honour due.”
14841,BOOK XVIII.,
14842,BOOK XVIII.,"Thus, as she spoke, the Goddess led her in,"
14843,BOOK XVIII.,"And on a seat with silver studs adorn’d,"
14844,BOOK XVIII.,"Fair, richly wrought, a footstool at her feet,"
14845,BOOK XVIII.,She bade her sit; then thus to Vulcan call’d:
14846,BOOK XVIII.,"“Haste hither, Vulcan; Thetis asks thine aid.”"
14847,BOOK XVIII.,
14848,BOOK XVIII.,Whom answer’d thus the skill’d artificer:
14849,BOOK XVIII.,“An honour’d and a venerated guest
14850,BOOK XVIII.,"Our house contains; who sav’d me once from woe,"
14851,BOOK XVIII.,"When by my mother’s act from Heav’n I fell,"
14852,BOOK XVIII.,"Who, for that I was crippled in my feet,"
14853,BOOK XVIII.,Deem’d it not shame to hide me: hard had then
14854,BOOK XVIII.,"My fortune been, had not Eurynome"
14855,BOOK XVIII.,And Thetis in their bosoms shelter’d me;
14856,BOOK XVIII.,"Eurynome, from old Oceanus"
14857,BOOK XVIII.,"Who drew her birth, the ever-circling flood."
14858,BOOK XVIII.,"Nine years with them I dwelt, and many a work"
14859,BOOK XVIII.,"I fashion’d there of metal, clasps, and chains"
14860,BOOK XVIII.,"Of spiral coil, rich cups, and collars fair,"
14861,BOOK XVIII.,Hid in a cave profound; where th’ ocean stream
14862,BOOK XVIII.,With ceaseless murmur foam’d and moan’d around;
14863,BOOK XVIII.,"Unknown to God or man, but to those two"
14864,BOOK XVIII.,"Who sav’d me, Thetis and Eurynome."
14865,BOOK XVIII.,Now to my house hath fair-hair’d Thetis come;
14866,BOOK XVIII.,"To her, my life preserv’d its tribute owes:"
14867,BOOK XVIII.,Then thou the hospitable rites perform.
14868,BOOK XVIII.,While I my bellows and my tools lay by.”
14869,BOOK XVIII.,
14870,BOOK XVIII.,"He said, and from the anvil rear’d upright"
14871,BOOK XVIII.,"His massive strength; and as he limp’d along,"
14872,BOOK XVIII.,His tottering knees were bow’d beneath his weight.
14873,BOOK XVIII.,"The bellows from the fire he next withdrew,"
14874,BOOK XVIII.,And in a silver casket plac’d his tools;
14875,BOOK XVIII.,Then with a sponge his brows and lusty arms
14876,BOOK XVIII.,"He wip’d, and sturdy neck and hairy chest."
14877,BOOK XVIII.,"He donn’d his robe, and took his weighty staff;"
14878,BOOK XVIII.,Then through the door with halting step he pass’d;
14879,BOOK XVIII.,There waited on their King the attendant maids;
14880,BOOK XVIII.,"In form as living maids, but wrought in gold;"
14881,BOOK XVIII.,"Instinct with consciousness, with voice endued,"
14882,BOOK XVIII.,"And strength, and skill from heav’nly teachers drawn."
14883,BOOK XVIII.,"These waited, duteous, at the Monarch’s side,"
14884,BOOK XVIII.,"His steps supporting; he, with halting gait,"
14885,BOOK XVIII.,"Pass’d to a gorgeous chair by Thetis’ side,"
14886,BOOK XVIII.,"And, as her hand he clasp’d, address’d her thus:"
14887,BOOK XVIII.,
14888,BOOK XVIII.,"“Say, Thetis of the flowing robe, belov’d"
14889,BOOK XVIII.,"And honour’d, whence this visit to our house."
14890,BOOK XVIII.,"An unaccustom’d guest? say what thy will,"
14891,BOOK XVIII.,"And, if within my pow’r, esteem it done.”"
14892,BOOK XVIII.,
14893,BOOK XVIII.,"To whom in answer Thetis, weeping, thus:"
14894,BOOK XVIII.,"“Vulcan, of all the Goddesses who dwell"
14895,BOOK XVIII.,"On high Olympus, lives there one whose soul"
14896,BOOK XVIII.,"Hath borne such weight of woe, so many griefs,"
14897,BOOK XVIII.,As Saturn’s son hath heap’d on me alone?
14898,BOOK XVIII.,"Me, whom he chose from all the sea-born nymphs,"
14899,BOOK XVIII.,"And gave to Peleus, son of Æacus,"
14900,BOOK XVIII.,"His subject; I endur’d a mortal’s bed,"
14901,BOOK XVIII.,"Though sore against my will; he now, bent down"
14902,BOOK XVIII.,"By feeble age, lies helpless in his house."
14903,BOOK XVIII.,Now adds he farther grief; he granted me
14904,BOOK XVIII.,"To bear, and rear, a son, of heroes chief;"
14905,BOOK XVIII.,"Like a young tree he throve; I tended him,"
14906,BOOK XVIII.,In a rich vineyard as the choicest plant:
14907,BOOK XVIII.,Till in the beaked ships I sent him forth
14908,BOOK XVIII.,"To war with Troy; him ne’er shall I receive,"
14909,BOOK XVIII.,"Returning home, in aged Peleus’ house."
14910,BOOK XVIII.,"E’en while he lives, and sees the light of day,"
14911,BOOK XVIII.,"He lives in sorrow; nor, to soothe his grief,"
14912,BOOK XVIII.,"My presence can avail; a girl, his prize,"
14913,BOOK XVIII.,"Selected for him by the sons of Greece,"
14914,BOOK XVIII.,Great Agamemnon wrested from his arms:
14915,BOOK XVIII.,In grief and rage he pin’d his soul away;
14916,BOOK XVIII.,Then by the Trojans were the Greeks hemm’d in
14917,BOOK XVIII.,"Beside their ships, and from within their camp"
14918,BOOK XVIII.,No outlet found; the Grecian Elders then
14919,BOOK XVIII.,"Implor’d his aid, and promis’d costly gifts."
14920,BOOK XVIII.,With his own hand to save them he refus’d;
14921,BOOK XVIII.,"But, in his armour clad, to battle sent"
14922,BOOK XVIII.,"His friend Patroclus, with a num’rous band."
14923,BOOK XVIII.,All day they fought before the Scaean* gates;
14924,BOOK XVIII.,"And in that day had Ilium been destroy’d,"
14925,BOOK XVIII.,"But in the van, Menoetius’ noble son."
14926,BOOK XVIII.,"After great deeds achiev’d, Apollo slew,"
14927,BOOK XVIII.,"And crown’d with glory Hector, Priam’s son."
14928,BOOK XVIII.,"Therefore a suppliant to thy knees I come,"
14929,BOOK XVIII.,"If to my son, to early death condemn’d,"
14930,BOOK XVIII.,"Thou wilt accord the boon of shield and helm,"
14931,BOOK XVIII.,"And well-wrought greaves with silver clasps secur’d,"
14932,BOOK XVIII.,"And breastplate; for his own, his faithful friend,"
14933,BOOK XVIII.,"By Trojan hands subdued, hath lost; and he,"
14934,BOOK XVIII.,"O’erwhelm’d with grief, lies prostrate on the earth.”"
14935,BOOK XVIII.,
14936,BOOK XVIII.,Whom answer’d thus the skill’d artificer:
14937,BOOK XVIII.,"“Take comfort, nor let this disturb thy mind;"
14938,BOOK XVIII.,"Would that as surely, when his hour shall come,"
14939,BOOK XVIII.,"I could defend him from the stroke of death,"
14940,BOOK XVIII.,As I can undertake that his shall be
14941,BOOK XVIII.,Such arms as they shall marvel who behold.”
14942,BOOK XVIII.,
14943,BOOK XVIII.,"He left her thus, and to his forge return’d;"
14944,BOOK XVIII.,"The bellows then directing to the fire,"
14945,BOOK XVIII.,He bade them work; through twenty pipes at once
14946,BOOK XVIII.,Forthwith they pour’d their diverse-temper’d blasts;
14947,BOOK XVIII.,"Now briskly seconding his eager haste,"
14948,BOOK XVIII.,"Now at his will, and as the work requir’d."
14949,BOOK XVIII.,"The stubborn brass, and tin, and precious gold,"
14950,BOOK XVIII.,"And silver, first he melted in the fire,"
14951,BOOK XVIII.,Then on its stand his weighty anvil plac’d;
14952,BOOK XVIII.,And with one hand the hammer’s pond’rous weight
14953,BOOK XVIII.,"He wielded, while the other grasp’d the tongs."
14954,BOOK XVIII.,
14955,BOOK XVIII.,"And first a shield he fashion’d, vast and strong,"
14956,BOOK XVIII.,"With rich adornment; circled with a rim,"
14957,BOOK XVIII.,"Threefold, bright-gleaming, whence a silver belt"
14958,BOOK XVIII.,Depended; of five folds the shield was form’d;
14959,BOOK XVIII.,And on its surface many a rare design
14960,BOOK XVIII.,Of curious art his practis’d skill had wrought.
14961,BOOK XVIII.,
14962,BOOK XVIII.,"Thereon were figur’d earth, and sky, and sea,"
14963,BOOK XVIII.,"The ever-circling sun, and full-orb’d moon,"
14964,BOOK XVIII.,And all the signs that crown the vault of Heav’n;
14965,BOOK XVIII.,"Pleiads and Hyads, and Orion’s might,"
14966,BOOK XVIII.,"And Arctos, call’d the Wain, who wheels on high"
14967,BOOK XVIII.,"His circling course, and on Orion waits;"
14968,BOOK XVIII.,Sole star that never bathes in th’ ocean wave.
14969,BOOK XVIII.,
14970,BOOK XVIII.,And two fair populous towns were sculptur’d there;
14971,BOOK XVIII.,In one were marriage pomp and revelry.
14972,BOOK XVIII.,"And brides, in gay procession, through the streets"
14973,BOOK XVIII.,"With blazing torches from their chambers borne,"
14974,BOOK XVIII.,While frequent rose the hymeneal song.
14975,BOOK XVIII.,"Youths whirl’d around in joyous dance, with sound"
14976,BOOK XVIII.,"Of flute and harp; and, standing at their doors,"
14977,BOOK XVIII.,Admiring women on the pageant gaz’d.
14978,BOOK XVIII.,
14979,BOOK XVIII.,Meanwhile a busy throng the forum fill’d:
14980,BOOK XVIII.,"There between two a fierce contention rose,"
14981,BOOK XVIII.,About a death-fine; to the public one
14982,BOOK XVIII.,"Appeal’d, asserting to have paid the whole;"
14983,BOOK XVIII.,While one denied that he had aught receiv’d.
14984,BOOK XVIII.,Both were desirous that before the Judge
14985,BOOK XVIII.,The issue should be tried; with noisy shouts
14986,BOOK XVIII.,Their several partisans encourag’d each.
14987,BOOK XVIII.,The heralds still’d the tumult of the crowd:
14988,BOOK XVIII.,"On polish’d chairs, in solemn circle, sat"
14989,BOOK XVIII.,The rev’rend Elders; in their hands they held
14990,BOOK XVIII.,"The loud-voic’d heralds’ sceptres; waving these,"
14991,BOOK XVIII.,They heard th’ alternate pleadings; in the midst
14992,BOOK XVIII.,"Two talents lay of gold, which he should take"
14993,BOOK XVIII.,Who should before them prove his righteous cause.
14994,BOOK XVIII.,
14995,BOOK XVIII.,"Before the second town two armies lay,"
14996,BOOK XVIII.,In arms refulgent; to destroy the town
14997,BOOK XVIII.,"Th’ assailants threaten’d, or among themselves"
14998,BOOK XVIII.,Of all the wealth within the city stor’d
14999,BOOK XVIII.,"An equal half, as ransom, to divide."
15000,BOOK XVIII.,"The terms rejecting, the defenders mann’d"
15001,BOOK XVIII.,A secret ambush; on the walls they plac’d
15002,BOOK XVIII.,"Women and children muster’d for defence,"
15003,BOOK XVIII.,"And men by age enfeebled; forth they went,"
15004,BOOK XVIII.,"By Mars and Pallas led; these, wrought in gold,"
15005,BOOK XVIII.,"In golden arms array’d, above the crowd"
15006,BOOK XVIII.,"For beauty and stature, as befitting Gods,"
15007,BOOK XVIII.,Conspicuous shone; of lesser height the rest.
15008,BOOK XVIII.,"But when the destin’d ambuscade was reach’d,"
15009,BOOK XVIII.,"Beside the river, where the shepherds drove"
15010,BOOK XVIII.,"Their flocks and herds to water, down they lay,"
15011,BOOK XVIII.,In glitt’ring arms accoutred; and apart
15012,BOOK XVIII.,"They plac’d two spies, to notify betimes"
15013,BOOK XVIII.,Th’ approach of flocks of sheep and lowing herds.
15014,BOOK XVIII.,"These, in two shepherds’ charge, ere long appear’d,"
15015,BOOK XVIII.,"Who, unsuspecting as they mov’d along,"
15016,BOOK XVIII.,Enjoy’d the music of their past’ral pipes.
15017,BOOK XVIII.,"They on the booty, from afar discern’d,"
15018,BOOK XVIII.,Sprang from their ambuscade; and cutting off
15019,BOOK XVIII.,"The herds, and fleecy flocks, their guardians slew."
15020,BOOK XVIII.,"Their comrades heard the tumult, where they sat"
15021,BOOK XVIII.,"Before their sacred altars, and forthwith"
15022,BOOK XVIII.,"Sprang on their cars, and with fast-stepping steeds"
15023,BOOK XVIII.,"Pursued the plund’rers, and o’ertook them soon."
15024,BOOK XVIII.,"There on the river’s bank they met in arms,"
15025,BOOK XVIII.,And each at other hurl’d their brazen spears.
15026,BOOK XVIII.,"And there were figur’d Strife, and Tumult wild,"
15027,BOOK XVIII.,"And deadly Fate, who in her iron grasp"
15028,BOOK XVIII.,"One newly-wounded, one unwounded bore,"
15029,BOOK XVIII.,While by the feet from out the press she dragg’d
15030,BOOK XVIII.,Another slain: about her shoulders hung
15031,BOOK XVIII.,A garment crimson’d with the blood of men.
15032,BOOK XVIII.,"Like living men they seem’d to move, to fight,"
15033,BOOK XVIII.,To drag away the bodies of the slain.
15034,BOOK XVIII.,
15035,BOOK XVIII.,And there was grav’n a wide-extended plain
15036,BOOK XVIII.,"Of fallow land, rich, fertile, mellow soil,"
15037,BOOK XVIII.,Thrice plough’d; where many ploughmen up and down
15038,BOOK XVIII.,Their teams were driving; and as each attain’d
15039,BOOK XVIII.,"The limit of the field, would one advance,"
15040,BOOK XVIII.,And tender him a cup of gen’rous wine:
15041,BOOK XVIII.,"Then would he turn, and to the end again"
15042,BOOK XVIII.,Along the furrow cheerly drive his plough.
15043,BOOK XVIII.,"And still behind them darker show’d the soil,"
15044,BOOK XVIII.,"The true presentment of a new-plough’d field,"
15045,BOOK XVIII.,Though wrought in gold; a miracle of art.
15046,BOOK XVIII.,
15047,BOOK XVIII.,"There too was grav’n a corn-field, rich in grain,"
15048,BOOK XVIII.,"Where with sharp sickles reapers plied their task,"
15049,BOOK XVIII.,"And thick, in even swathe, the trusses fell;"
15050,BOOK XVIII.,"The binders, following close, the bundles tied:"
15051,BOOK XVIII.,Three were the binders; and behind them boys
15052,BOOK XVIII.,"In close attendance waiting, in their arms"
15053,BOOK XVIII.,"Gather’d the bundles, and in order pil’d."
15054,BOOK XVIII.,"Amid them, staff in hand, in silence stood"
15055,BOOK XVIII.,"The King, rejoicing in the plenteous swathe."
15056,BOOK XVIII.,"A little way remov’d, the heralds slew"
15057,BOOK XVIII.,"A sturdy ox, and now beneath an oak"
15058,BOOK XVIII.,"Prepar’d the feast; while women mix’d, hard by,"
15059,BOOK XVIII.,White barley porridge for the lab’rers’ meal.
15060,BOOK XVIII.,
15061,BOOK XVIII.,"And, with rich clusters laden, there was grav’n"
15062,BOOK XVIII.,"A vineyard fair, all gold; of glossy black"
15063,BOOK XVIII.,"The bunches were, on silver poles sustain’d;"
15064,BOOK XVIII.,"Around, a darksome trench; beyond, a fence"
15065,BOOK XVIII.,"Was wrought, of shining tin; and through it led"
15066,BOOK XVIII.,"One only path, by which the bearers pass’d,"
15067,BOOK XVIII.,Who gather’d in the vineyard’s bounteous store.
15068,BOOK XVIII.,"There maids and youths, in joyous spirits bright,"
15069,BOOK XVIII.,In woven baskets bore the luscious fruit.
15070,BOOK XVIII.,"A boy, amid them, from a clear-ton’d harp"
15071,BOOK XVIII.,Drew lovely music; well his liquid voice
15072,BOOK XVIII.,The strings accompanied; they all with dance
15073,BOOK XVIII.,"And song harmonious join’d, and joyous shouts,"
15074,BOOK XVIII.,As the gay bevy lightly tripp’d along.
15075,BOOK XVIII.,
15076,BOOK XVIII.,Of straight-horn’d cattle too a herd was grav’n;
15077,BOOK XVIII.,Of gold and tin the heifers all were wrought:
15078,BOOK XVIII.,"They to the pasture, from the cattle-yard,"
15079,BOOK XVIII.,"With gentle lowings, by a babbling stream,"
15080,BOOK XVIII.,"Where quiv’ring reed-beds rustled, slowly mov’d."
15081,BOOK XVIII.,"Four golden shepherds walk’d beside the herd,"
15082,BOOK XVIII.,By nine swift dogs attended; then amid
15083,BOOK XVIII.,The foremost heifers sprang two lions fierce
15084,BOOK XVIII.,"Upon the lordly bull: he, bellowing loud,"
15085,BOOK XVIII.,"Was dragg’d along, by dogs and youths pursued."
15086,BOOK XVIII.,"The tough bull’s-hide they tore, and gorging lapp’d"
15087,BOOK XVIII.,Th’ intestines and dark blood; with vain attempt
15088,BOOK XVIII.,"The herdsmen following closely, to the attack"
15089,BOOK XVIII.,"Cheer’d their swift dogs; these shunn’d the lions’ jaws,"
15090,BOOK XVIII.,"And close around them baying, held aloof."
15091,BOOK XVIII.,
15092,BOOK XVIII.,And there the skilful artist’s hand had trac’d
15093,BOOK XVIII.,"A pastaro broad, with fleecy flocks o’erspread,"
15094,BOOK XVIII.,"In a fair glade, with fold, and tents, and pens."
15095,BOOK XVIII.,
15096,BOOK XVIII.,"There, too, the skilful artist’s hand had wrought"
15097,BOOK XVIII.,"With curious workmanship, a mazy dance,"
15098,BOOK XVIII.,Like that which Daedalus in Cnossus erst
15099,BOOK XVIII.,At fair-hair’d Ariadne’s bidding fram’d.
15100,BOOK XVIII.,"There, laying each on other’s wrists their hand,"
15101,BOOK XVIII.,Bright youths and many-suitor’d maidens danc’d:
15102,BOOK XVIII.,"In fair white linen these; in tunics those,"
15103,BOOK XVIII.,"Well woven, shining soft with fragrant oils;"
15104,BOOK XVIII.,"These with fair coronets were crown’d, while those"
15105,BOOK XVIII.,With golden swords from silver belts were girt.
15106,BOOK XVIII.,"Now whirl’d they round with nimble practis’d feet,"
15107,BOOK XVIII.,"Easy, as when a potter, seated, turns"
15108,BOOK XVIII.,"A wheel, new fashion’d by his skilful hand,"
15109,BOOK XVIII.,"And spins it round, to prove if true it run;"
15110,BOOK XVIII.,Now featly mov’d in well-beseeming ranks.
15111,BOOK XVIII.,"A num’rous crowd, around, the lovely dance"
15112,BOOK XVIII.,"Survey’d, delighted; while an honour’d Bard"
15113,BOOK XVIII.,"Sang, as he struck the lyre, and to the strain"
15114,BOOK XVIII.,"Two tumblers, in the midst, were whirling round."
15115,BOOK XVIII.,
15116,BOOK XVIII.,About the margin of the massive shield
15117,BOOK XVIII.,Was wrought the mighty strength of th’ ocean stream.
15118,BOOK XVIII.,
15119,BOOK XVIII.,"The shield completed, vast and strong, he forg’d"
15120,BOOK XVIII.,"A breastplate, dazzling bright as flame of fire;"
15121,BOOK XVIII.,"And next, a weighty helmet for his head,"
15122,BOOK XVIII.,"Fair, richly wrought, with crest of gold above;"
15123,BOOK XVIII.,"Then last, well-fitting greaves of pliant tin."
15124,BOOK XVIII.,
15125,BOOK XVIII.,The skill’d artificer his works complete
15126,BOOK XVIII.,Before Achilles’ Goddess-mother laid:
15127,BOOK XVIII.,"She, like a falcon, from the snow-clad heights"
15128,BOOK XVIII.,"Of huge Olympus, darted swiftly down,"
15129,BOOK XVIII.,Charg’d with the glitt’ring arms by Vulcan wrought.

15161,BOOK XIX.,"The gift of Vulcan; there her son she found,"
15162,BOOK XIX.,Who o’er Patroclus hung in bitter grief;
15163,BOOK XIX.,Around him mourn’d his comrades; in the midst
15164,BOOK XIX.,"She stood, and clasp’d his hand, as thus she spoke:"
15165,BOOK XIX.,
15166,BOOK XIX.,"“Leave we, my son, though deep our grief, the dead;"
15167,BOOK XIX.,"Here let him lie, since Heav’n hath doom’d his fall;"

15171,BOOK XIX.,The Goddess laid; loud rang the wondrous work.
15172,BOOK XIX.,With awe the Myrmidons beheld; nor dar’d
15173,BOOK XIX.,"Affront the sight: but as Achilles gaz’d,"
15174,BOOK XIX.,More fiery burn’d his wrath; beneath his brows
15175,BOOK XIX.,His eyes like lightning flash’d; with fierce delight
15176,BOOK XIX.,He seiz’d the glorious gift: and when his soul
15177,BOOK XIX.,"Had feasted on the miracle of art,"
15178,BOOK XIX.,To Thetis thus his winged words address’d:
15179,BOOK XIX.,
15180,BOOK XIX.,"“Mother, the God hath giv’n me arms indeed,"
15181,BOOK XIX.,"Worthy a God, and such as mortal man"
15182,BOOK XIX.,Could never forge; I go to arm me straight;
15183,BOOK XIX.,"Yet fear I for Menoetius’ noble son,"
15184,BOOK XIX.,Lest in his spear-inflicted wounds the flies
15185,BOOK XIX.,"May gender worms, and desecrate the dead,"
15186,BOOK XIX.,"And, life extinct, corruption reach his flesh.”"
15187,BOOK XIX.,
15188,BOOK XIX.,Whom answer’d thus the silver-footed Queen:
15189,BOOK XIX.,"“Let not such fears, my son, disturb thy mind:"
15190,BOOK XIX.,"I will myself the swarms of flies disperse,"
15191,BOOK XIX.,That on the flesh of slaughter’d warriors prey:
15192,BOOK XIX.,"And should he here remain a year complete,"
15193,BOOK XIX.,Still should his flesh be firm and fresh as now:
15194,BOOK XIX.,But thou to council call the chiefs of Greece;
15195,BOOK XIX.,"Against the monarch Agamemnon there,"
15196,BOOK XIX.,"The leader of the host, abjure thy wrath;"
15197,BOOK XIX.,"Then arm thee quickly, and put on thy might.”"
15198,BOOK XIX.,
15199,BOOK XIX.,Her words with dauntless courage fill’d his breast.

15202,BOOK XIX.,
15203,BOOK XIX.,"Along the ocean beach Achilles pass’d,"
15204,BOOK XIX.,"And loudly shouting, call’d on all the chiefs;"

15206,BOOK XIX.,"The steersmen, who the vessels’ rudders hold,"
15207,BOOK XIX.,"The very stewards that serv’d the daily bread,"
15208,BOOK XIX.,"All to th’ assembly throng’d, when reappear’d"

15215,BOOK XIX.,"Next follow’d Agamemnon, King of men,"
15216,BOOK XIX.,"He also wounded; for Antenor’s son,"
15217,BOOK XIX.,"Coon, had stabb’d him in the stubborn fight."
15218,BOOK XIX.,"When all the Greeks were closely throng’d around,"
15219,BOOK XIX.,"Up rose Achilles swift of foot, and said:"
15220,BOOK XIX.,
15221,BOOK XIX.,"“Great son of Atreus, what hath been the gain"
15222,BOOK XIX.,"To thee or me, since heart-consuming strife"
15223,BOOK XIX.,"Hath fiercely rag’d between us, for a girl,"
15224,BOOK XIX.,Who would to Heav’n had died by Dian’s shafts
15225,BOOK XIX.,That day when from Lyrnessus’ captur’d town
15226,BOOK XIX.,I bore her off? so had not many a Greek
15227,BOOK XIX.,"Bitten the bloody dust, by hostile hands"
15228,BOOK XIX.,"Subdued, while I in anger stood aloof."
15229,BOOK XIX.,"Great was the gain to Troy; but Greeks, methinks,"
15230,BOOK XIX.,Will long retain the mem’ry of our feud.
15231,BOOK XIX.,"Yet pass we that; and though our hearts be sore,"
15232,BOOK XIX.,Still let us school our angry spirits down.
15233,BOOK XIX.,My wrath I here abjure; it is not meet
15234,BOOK XIX.,It burn for ever unappeas’d; do thou
15235,BOOK XIX.,Muster to battle straight the long-hair’d Greeks;
15236,BOOK XIX.,"That, to the Trojans once again oppos’d,"
15237,BOOK XIX.,I may make trial if beside the ships
15238,BOOK XIX.,"They dare this night remain; but he, I ween,"
15239,BOOK XIX.,"Will gladly rest his limbs, who safe shall fly,"
15240,BOOK XIX.,"My spear escaping, from the battle-field.”"
15241,BOOK XIX.,
15242,BOOK XIX.,He said: the well-greav’d Greeks rejoic’d to hear
15243,BOOK XIX.,His wrath abjur’d by Peleus’ godlike son;
15244,BOOK XIX.,"And from his seat, not standing in the midst,"
15245,BOOK XIX.,Thus to th’ assembly Agamemnon spoke:
15246,BOOK XIX.,"“Friends, Grecian Heroes, Ministers of Mars,"
15247,BOOK XIX.,"When one stands up to speak, ’tis meet for all"
15248,BOOK XIX.,"To lend a patient ear, nor interrupt;"
15249,BOOK XIX.,For e’en to practis’d speakers hard the task:
15250,BOOK XIX.,"But, in this vast assembly, who can speak"
15251,BOOK XIX.,That all may hear? the clearest voice must fail.
15252,BOOK XIX.,"To Peleus’ son, Achilles, I my mind"
15253,BOOK XIX.,Will frankly open; ye among yourselves
15254,BOOK XIX.,"Impart the words I speak, that all may know."
15255,BOOK XIX.,"Oft hath this matter been by Greeks discuss’d,"
15256,BOOK XIX.,And I their frequent censure have incurr’d:
15257,BOOK XIX.,"Yet was not I the cause; but Jove, and Fate,"
15258,BOOK XIX.,"And gloomy Erinnys, who combin’d to throw"
15259,BOOK XIX.,"A strong delusion o’er my mind, that day"
15260,BOOK XIX.,I robb’d Achilles of his lawful prize.
15261,BOOK XIX.,"What could I do? a Goddess all o’er-rul’d,"
15262,BOOK XIX.,"Daughter of Jove, dread Ate, baleful pow’r,"
15263,BOOK XIX.,"Misleading all; with lightest step she moves,"
15264,BOOK XIX.,"Not on the earth, but o’er the heads of men,"
15265,BOOK XIX.,With blighting touch; and many hath caus’d to err.
15266,BOOK XIX.,"E’en Jove, the wisest deem’d of Gods and men,"
15267,BOOK XIX.,"In error she involv’d, when Juno’s art"
15268,BOOK XIX.,"By female stratagem the God deceiv’d,"
15269,BOOK XIX.,When in well-girdled Thebes Alcmena lay
15270,BOOK XIX.,In travail of the might of Hercules.
15271,BOOK XIX.,In boastful tone amid the Gods he spoke:
15272,BOOK XIX.,"‘Hear all ye Gods, and all ye Goddesses,"
15273,BOOK XIX.,"The words I speak, the promptings of my soul."
15274,BOOK XIX.,This day Lucina shall to light bring forth
15275,BOOK XIX.,"A child, the future Lord of all around,"
15276,BOOK XIX.,"Of mortal men, who trace to me their blood.’"
15277,BOOK XIX.,"Whom answer’d Juno thus, with deep deceit:"
15278,BOOK XIX.,"‘Thou dost but feign, nor wilt fulfil thy word:"
15279,BOOK XIX.,"Come now, Olympian, swear a solemn oath"
15280,BOOK XIX.,"That he shall be the Lord of all around,"
15281,BOOK XIX.,"Who on this day shall be of woman born,"
15282,BOOK XIX.,"Of mortal men, who trace to thee their blood.’"
15283,BOOK XIX.,"She said, and Jove, the snare unseeing, swore"
15284,BOOK XIX.,A solemn oath; but found his error soon.
15285,BOOK XIX.,Down from Olympus’ height she sped in haste
15286,BOOK XIX.,To Argos of Achaia; for the wife
15287,BOOK XIX.,"Of Sthenelus, the son of Perseus, there,"
15288,BOOK XIX.,"She knew, was sev’n months pregnant of a son;"
15289,BOOK XIX.,"Whom, though untimely born, she brought to light,"
15290,BOOK XIX.,"Staying meanwhile Alcmena’s labour-pangs,"
15291,BOOK XIX.,"To Saturn’s son herself the tidings brought,"
15292,BOOK XIX.,"And thus address’d him: ‘Jove, the lightning’s Lord,"
15293,BOOK XIX.,"I bring thee news; this day a mighty man,"
15294,BOOK XIX.,"By thee ordain’d to be the Argives’ King,"
15295,BOOK XIX.,"Is born, Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus,"
15296,BOOK XIX.,"The son of Perseus, issue of thy blood;"
15297,BOOK XIX.,Well worthy he to be the Argives’ King.’
15298,BOOK XIX.,She said: keen sorrow deeply pierc’d his soul;
15299,BOOK XIX.,Then Ate by the glossy locks he seiz’d
15300,BOOK XIX.,"In mighty wrath; and swore a solemn oath,"
15301,BOOK XIX.,That to Olympus and the starry Heav’n
15302,BOOK XIX.,"She never should return, who all misleads."
15303,BOOK XIX.,"His arm then whirling, from the starry Heav’n"
15304,BOOK XIX.,"He flung her down, to vex th’ affairs of men."
15305,BOOK XIX.,"Yet oft her fraud remember’d he with groans,"
15306,BOOK XIX.,When by Eurystheus’ hard commands he saw
15307,BOOK XIX.,Condemn’d to servile tasks his noble son.
15308,BOOK XIX.,"So, oft as Hector of the glancing helm"
15309,BOOK XIX.,"Beside the ships the Greeks to slaughter gave,"
15310,BOOK XIX.,Back to my mind my former error came.
15311,BOOK XIX.,"I err’d, for Jove my judgment took away;"
15312,BOOK XIX.,"But friendly reconcilement now I seek,"
15313,BOOK XIX.,And tender costly presents; then thyself
15314,BOOK XIX.,"Uprouse thee, and excite the rest to arms."
15315,BOOK XIX.,"While I prepare the gifts, whate’er of late[6]"
15316,BOOK XIX.,The sage Ulysses promis’d in thy tent:
15317,BOOK XIX.,"Or, if thou wilt, though eager for the fray,"
15318,BOOK XIX.,"Remain thou here awhile, till from my ship"
15319,BOOK XIX.,My followers bring the gifts; that thou mayst see
15320,BOOK XIX.,I make my offerings with no niggard hand.”
15321,BOOK XIX.,
15322,BOOK XIX.,Whom answer’d thus Achilles swift of foot:
15323,BOOK XIX.,"“Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
15324,BOOK XIX.,"The gifts thou deem’st befitting, ’tis for thee"
15325,BOOK XIX.,"To give, or to withhold; but now at once"
15326,BOOK XIX.,Prepare we for the battle; ’tis not meet
15327,BOOK XIX.,"On trivial pretexts here to waste our time,"
15328,BOOK XIX.,Or idly loiter; much remains to do:
15329,BOOK XIX.,"Again be seen Achilles in the van,"
15330,BOOK XIX.,Scatt’ring with brazen spear the Trojan ranks;
15331,BOOK XIX.,"And ye, forget not man with man to fight.”"
15332,BOOK XIX.,
15333,BOOK XIX.,To whom in answer sage Ulysses thus:
15334,BOOK XIX.,"“Brave as thou art, Achilles, godlike chief,"
15335,BOOK XIX.,Yet fasting lead not forth the sons of Greece
15336,BOOK XIX.,To fight the Trojans; for no little time
15337,BOOK XIX.,"Will last the struggle, when the serried ranks"
15338,BOOK XIX.,"Are once engag’d in conflict, and the Gods"
15339,BOOK XIX.,With equal courage either side inspire:
15340,BOOK XIX.,"But bid them, by the ships, of food and wine"
15341,BOOK XIX.,(Wherein are strength and courage) first partake;
15342,BOOK XIX.,"For none throughout the day till set of sun,"
15343,BOOK XIX.,"Fasting from food, may bear the toils of war;"
15344,BOOK XIX.,His spirit may still be eager for the fray;
15345,BOOK XIX.,"Yet are his limbs by slow degrees weigh’d down,"
15346,BOOK XIX.,"Himself by thirst and hunger worn, his knees"
15347,BOOK XIX.,"Unable, as he moves, to bear his weight."
15348,BOOK XIX.,"But he who, first with food and wine refresh’d,"
15349,BOOK XIX.,"All day maintains the combat with the foe,"
15350,BOOK XIX.,"His spirit retains unbroken, and his limbs"
15351,BOOK XIX.,"Unwearied, till both armies quit the field."
15352,BOOK XIX.,"Disperse then now the crowd, and bid prepare"
15353,BOOK XIX.,The morning meal; meantime to public view
15354,BOOK XIX.,"Let Agamemnon, King of men, display"
15355,BOOK XIX.,"His costly gifts; that all the Greeks may see,"
15356,BOOK XIX.,And that thy heart within thee melt with joy:
15357,BOOK XIX.,And there in full assembly let him swear
15358,BOOK XIX.,"A solemn oath, that he hath ne’er approach’d"
15359,BOOK XIX.,"The fair Briseis’ bed, nor held with her"
15360,BOOK XIX.,Such intercourse as man with woman holds.
15361,BOOK XIX.,"Be thou propitious, and accept his oath."
15362,BOOK XIX.,Then at a sumptuous banquet in his tent
15363,BOOK XIX.,Let him receive thee; that thine honour due
15364,BOOK XIX.,"May nothing lack; and so, Atrides, thou"
15365,BOOK XIX.,Shalt stand in sight of all men clear of blame;
15366,BOOK XIX.,For none can wonder that insulting speech
15367,BOOK XIX.,Should rouse the anger of a sceptred King.”
15368,BOOK XIX.,
15369,BOOK XIX.,"To whom thus Agamemnon, King of men:"
15370,BOOK XIX.,"“Son of Laertes, I accept thy speech"
15371,BOOK XIX.,With cordial welcome: all that thou hast said
15372,BOOK XIX.,"Is well and wisely spoken; for the oath,"
15373,BOOK XIX.,"I am prepar’d, with willing mind, to swear;"
15374,BOOK XIX.,Nor in the sight of Heav’n will be forsworn.
15375,BOOK XIX.,"Let then Achilles here awhile remain,"
15376,BOOK XIX.,"Though eager for the fray; ye too remain,"
15377,BOOK XIX.,"Until the presents from my tent be brought,"
15378,BOOK XIX.,And we our solemn compact ratify.
15379,BOOK XIX.,Then this command upon thyself I lay:
15380,BOOK XIX.,That thou the noblest youths of all the Greeks
15381,BOOK XIX.,"Select, and bid them from my vessel bear"
15382,BOOK XIX.,"The gifts, which, to Achilles yesternight"
15383,BOOK XIX.,"We promis’d, and withal the women bring;"
15384,BOOK XIX.,And let Talthybius through the host seek out
15385,BOOK XIX.,"A boar, for sacrifice to Jove and Sol.”"
15386,BOOK XIX.,
15387,BOOK XIX.,Whom answer’d thus Achilles swift of foot:
15388,BOOK XIX.,"“Most mighty Agamemnon, King of men,"
15389,BOOK XIX.,These matters to some future time were best
15390,BOOK XIX.,"Deferr’d, some hour of respite from the fight,"
15391,BOOK XIX.,Of rage less fiercely burning in my breast;
15392,BOOK XIX.,"But slaughter’d now they lie, whom Priam’s son,"
15393,BOOK XIX.,"Hector, hath slain, by Jove to vict’ry led."
15394,BOOK XIX.,"Ye bid us take our food; if I might rule,"
15395,BOOK XIX.,"I would to battle lead the sons of Greece,"
15396,BOOK XIX.,"Unfed, and fasting; and at set of sun,"
15397,BOOK XIX.,"Our shame aveng’d, an ample feast prepare;"
15398,BOOK XIX.,"Till then, nor food nor drink shall pass my lips,"
15399,BOOK XIX.,"My comrade slain; who pierc’d with mortal wounds,"
15400,BOOK XIX.,"Turn’d tow’rd the doorway, lies within my tent,"
15401,BOOK XIX.,"His mourning friends around; while there he lies,"
15402,BOOK XIX.,"No thought have I for these or aught beside,"
15403,BOOK XIX.,"Save carnage, blood, and groans of dying men.”"
15404,BOOK XIX.,
15405,BOOK XIX.,"To whom Ulysses, sage in council, thus:"
15406,BOOK XIX.,"“O son of Peleus, noblest of the Greeks,"
15407,BOOK XIX.,"How far, Achilles, thou surpassest me"
15408,BOOK XIX.,"In deeds of arms, I know: but thou must yield"
15409,BOOK XIX.,"To me in counsel, for my years are more,"
15410,BOOK XIX.,And my experience greater far than thine:
15411,BOOK XIX.,Then to my words incline a patient ear.
15412,BOOK XIX.,"Men soonest weary of battle, where the sword"
15413,BOOK XIX.,The bloodiest harvest reaps; the lightest crop
15414,BOOK XIX.,"Of slaughter is where Jove inclines the scale,"
15415,BOOK XIX.,"Dispenser, at his will, of human wars."
15416,BOOK XIX.,The Greeks by fasting cannot mourn their dead;
15417,BOOK XIX.,For day by day successive numbers fall;
15418,BOOK XIX.,Where were the respite then from ceaseless fast?
15419,BOOK XIX.,"Behoves us bury out of sight our dead,"
15420,BOOK XIX.,"Steeling our hearts, and weeping but a day;"
15421,BOOK XIX.,"And we, the rest, whom cruel war has spar’d,"
15422,BOOK XIX.,Should first with food and wine recruit our strength;
15423,BOOK XIX.,"Then, girding on our arms, the livelong day"
15424,BOOK XIX.,"Maintain the war, unwearied; then let none"
15425,BOOK XIX.,Require a farther summons to the field;
15426,BOOK XIX.,(And woe to him who loit’ring by the ships
15427,BOOK XIX.,That summons hears;) but with united force
15428,BOOK XIX.,Against the Trojans wake the furious war.”
15429,BOOK XIX.,
15430,BOOK XIX.,"He said, and call’d on noble Nestor’s sons,"
15431,BOOK XIX.,"On Meges, Phyleus’ son, Meriones,"
15432,BOOK XIX.,"Thoas, and Lycomedes, Creon’s son,"
15433,BOOK XIX.,And Melanippus; they together sought
15434,BOOK XIX.,The mighty monarch Agamemnon’s tent.
15435,BOOK XIX.,"Soon as the word was giv’n, the work was done;"
15436,BOOK XIX.,"Sev’n tripods brought they out, the promis’d gifts;"
15437,BOOK XIX.,"Twelve horses, twenty caldrons glitt’ring bright;"
15438,BOOK XIX.,"Sev’n women too, well skill’d in household cares,"
15439,BOOK XIX.,"With whom, the eighth, the fair Briseis came."
15440,BOOK XIX.,"Ulysses led the way, and with him brought"
15441,BOOK XIX.,Ten talents full of gold; th’ attendant youths
15442,BOOK XIX.,"The other presents bore, and in the midst"
15443,BOOK XIX.,Display’d before th’ assembly: then uprose
15444,BOOK XIX.,"The monarch Agamemnon; by his side,"
15445,BOOK XIX.,"With voice of godlike pow’r, Talthybius stood,"
15446,BOOK XIX.,Holding the victim: then Atrides drew
15447,BOOK XIX.,"The dagger, ever hanging at his side,"
15448,BOOK XIX.,"Close by the scabbard of his mighty sword,"
15449,BOOK XIX.,And from the victim’s head the bristles shore.
15450,BOOK XIX.,With hands uplifted then to Jove he pray’d;
15451,BOOK XIX.,"While all around the Greeks in silence stood,"
15452,BOOK XIX.,"List’ning, decorous, to the monarch’s words,"
15453,BOOK XIX.,As looking up to Heav’n he made his pray’r:
15454,BOOK XIX.,
15455,BOOK XIX.,"“Be witness, Jove, thou highest, first of Gods,"
15456,BOOK XIX.,"And Sun, and Earth, and ye who vengeance wreak"
15457,BOOK XIX.,"Beneath the earth on souls of men forsworn,"
15458,BOOK XIX.,"Furies! that never, or to love unchaste"
15459,BOOK XIX.,"Soliciting, or otherwise, my hand"
15460,BOOK XIX.,Hath fair Briseis touch’d; but in my tent
15461,BOOK XIX.,Still pure and undefil’d hath she remain’d:
15462,BOOK XIX.,"And if in this I be forsworn, may Heav’n"
15463,BOOK XIX.,"With all the plagues afflict me, due to those"
15464,BOOK XIX.,Who sin by perjur’d oaths against the Gods.”
15465,BOOK XIX.,
15466,BOOK XIX.,"Thus as he spoke, across the victim’s throat"
15467,BOOK XIX.,He drew the pitiless blade; Talthybius then
15468,BOOK XIX.,"To hoary Ocean’s depths the carcase threw,"
15469,BOOK XIX.,"Food for the fishes; then Achilles rose,"
15470,BOOK XIX.,And thus before th’ assembled Greeks he spoke:
15471,BOOK XIX.,
15472,BOOK XIX.,"“O Father Jove, how dost thou lead astray"
15473,BOOK XIX.,Our human judgments! ne’er had Atreus’ son
15474,BOOK XIX.,"My bosom fill’d with wrath, nor from my arms,"
15475,BOOK XIX.,"To his own loss, against my will had torn"
15476,BOOK XIX.,"The girl I lov’d, but that the will of Jove"
15477,BOOK XIX.,To death predestin’d many a valiant Greek.
15478,BOOK XIX.,Now to the meal; anon renew the war.”
15479,BOOK XIX.,
15480,BOOK XIX.,"This said, th’ assembly he dismiss’d in haste,"
15481,BOOK XIX.,The crowd dispersing to their sev’ral ships;
15482,BOOK XIX.,Upon the gifts the warlike Myrmidons
15483,BOOK XIX.,"Bestow’d their care, and bore them to the ships;"
15484,BOOK XIX.,Of Peleus’ godlike son; within the tent
15485,BOOK XIX.,"They laid them down, and there the women plac’d,"
15486,BOOK XIX.,While to the drove the followers led the steeds.
15487,BOOK XIX.,"Briseis, fair as golden Venus, saw"
15488,BOOK XIX.,"Patroclus lying, pierc’d with mortal wounds,"
15489,BOOK XIX.,"Within the tent; and with a bitter cry,"
15490,BOOK XIX.,"She flung her down upon the corpse, and tore"
15491,BOOK XIX.,"Her breast, her delicate neck, and beauteous cheeks;"
15492,BOOK XIX.,"And, weeping, thus the lovely woman wail’d:"
15493,BOOK XIX.,
15494,BOOK XIX.,"“Patroclus, dearly lov’d of this sad heart!"
15495,BOOK XIX.,"When last I left this tent, I left thee full"
15496,BOOK XIX.,"Of healthy life; returning now, I find"
15497,BOOK XIX.,"Only thy lifeless corpse, thou Prince of men!"
15498,BOOK XIX.,"So sorrow still, on sorrow heap’d, I bear."
15499,BOOK XIX.,"The husband of my youth, to whom my sire"
15500,BOOK XIX.,"And honour’d mother gave me, I beheld"
15501,BOOK XIX.,Slain with the sword before the city walls:
15502,BOOK XIX.,"Three brothers, whom with me one mother bore,"
15503,BOOK XIX.,"My dearly lov’d ones, all were doom’d to death:"
15504,BOOK XIX.,"Nor wouldst thou, when Achilles swift of foot"
15505,BOOK XIX.,"My husband slew, and royal Mynes’ town"
15506,BOOK XIX.,"In ruin laid, allow my tears to flow;"
15507,BOOK XIX.,But thou wouldst make me (such was still thy speech)
15508,BOOK XIX.,The wedded wife of Peleus’ godlike son:
15509,BOOK XIX.,"Thou wouldst to Phthia bear me in thy ship,"
15510,BOOK XIX.,"And there, thyself, amid the Myrmidons,"
15511,BOOK XIX.,"Wouldst give my marriage feast; then, unconsol’d,"
15512,BOOK XIX.,"I weep thy death, my ever-gentle friend!”"
15513,BOOK XIX.,
15514,BOOK XIX.,"Weeping, she spoke; the women join’d her wail:"
15515,BOOK XIX.,"Patroclus’ death the pretext for their tears,"
15516,BOOK XIX.,But each in secret wept her private griefs.
15517,BOOK XIX.,
15518,BOOK XIX.,"Around Achilles throng’d the elder men,"
15519,BOOK XIX.,"Urging to eat; but he, with groans, refus’d:"
15520,BOOK XIX.,"“I pray you, would you show your love, dear friends,"
15521,BOOK XIX.,Ask me not now with food or drink to appease
15522,BOOK XIX.,Hunger or thirst; a load of bitter grief
15523,BOOK XIX.,Weighs heavy on my soul; till set of sun
15524,BOOK XIX.,"Fasting will I remain, and still endure.”"
15525,BOOK XIX.,
15526,BOOK XIX.,The other monarchs at his word withdrew:
15527,BOOK XIX.,"The two Atridae, and Ulysses sage,"
15528,BOOK XIX.,"And Nestor and Idomeneus remain’d,"
15529,BOOK XIX.,"And aged Phoenix, to divert his grief;"
15530,BOOK XIX.,"But comfort none, save in the bloody jaws"
15531,BOOK XIX.,"Of battle would he take; by mem’ry stirr’d,"
15532,BOOK XIX.,"He heav’d a deep-drawn sigh, as thus he spoke:"
15533,BOOK XIX.,
15534,BOOK XIX.,"“How oft hast thou, ill-fated, dearest friend,"
15535,BOOK XIX.,Here in this tent with eager zeal prepar’d
15536,BOOK XIX.,"The tempting meal, whene’er the sons of Greece"
15537,BOOK XIX.,In haste would arm them for the bloody fray!
15538,BOOK XIX.,"Now liest thou there, while I, for love of thee,"
15539,BOOK XIX.,"From food and drink, before me plac’d, refrain:"
15540,BOOK XIX.,"For ne’er shall I again such sorrow know,"
15541,BOOK XIX.,"Not though I heard of aged Peleus’ death,"
15542,BOOK XIX.,"Who now in Phthia mourns, with tender tears,"
15543,BOOK XIX.,His absent son; he on a foreign shore
15544,BOOK XIX.,Is warring in that hateful Helen’s cause:
15545,BOOK XIX.,"No, nor of his, who now in Scyros’ isle"
15546,BOOK XIX.,"Is growing up, if yet indeed he live,"
15547,BOOK XIX.,"Young Neoptolemus, my godlike son."
15548,BOOK XIX.,"My hope had been indeed, that here in Troy,"
15549,BOOK XIX.,"Far from the plains of Argos, I alone"
15550,BOOK XIX.,"Was doom’d to die; and that to Phthia thou,"
15551,BOOK XIX.,"Return’d in safety, mightst my son convey"
15552,BOOK XIX.,"From Scyros home, and show him all my wealth,"
15553,BOOK XIX.,"My spoils, my slaves, my lofty, spacious house."
15554,BOOK XIX.,"For Peleus or to death, methinks, e’en now"
15555,BOOK XIX.,"Hath yielded, or not far from death remov’d,"
15556,BOOK XIX.,"Lives on in sorrow, bow’d by gloomy age,"
15557,BOOK XIX.,Expecting day by day the messenger
15558,BOOK XIX.,Who bears the mournful tidings of my death.”
15559,BOOK XIX.,
15560,BOOK XIX.,"Weeping, Achilles spoke; and with him wept"
15561,BOOK XIX.,The Elders; each to fond remembrance mov’d
15562,BOOK XIX.,Of all that in his home himself had left.
15563,BOOK XIX.,"The son of Saturn, pitying, saw their grief,"
15564,BOOK XIX.,And Pallas thus with winged words address’d:
15565,BOOK XIX.,"“My child, dost thou a hero’s cause forsake,"
15566,BOOK XIX.,"Or does Achilles claim no more thy care,"
15567,BOOK XIX.,"Who sits in sorrow by the high-prow’d ships,"
15568,BOOK XIX.,Mourning his comrade slain? the others all
15569,BOOK XIX.,"Partake the meal, while he from food abstains:"
15570,BOOK XIX.,"Then haste thee, and, with hunger lest he faint,"
15571,BOOK XIX.,Drop nectar and ambrosia on his breast.”
15572,BOOK XIX.,
15573,BOOK XIX.,His words fresh impulse gave to Pallas’ zeal:
15574,BOOK XIX.,"Down, like the long-wing’d falcon, shrill of voice,"
15575,BOOK XIX.,Thro’ the clear sky she swoop’d: and while the Greeks
15576,BOOK XIX.,"Arm’d for the fight, Achilles she approach’d,"
15577,BOOK XIX.,And nectar and ambrosia on his breast
15578,BOOK XIX.,"Distill’d, lest hunger should his strength subdue;"
15579,BOOK XIX.,Back to her mighty Father’s ample house
15580,BOOK XIX.,"Returning, as from out the ships they pour’d."
15581,BOOK XIX.,"Thick as the snow-flakes that from Heav’n descend,"
15582,BOOK XIX.,Before the sky-born Boreas’ chilling blast;
15583,BOOK XIX.,"So thick, outpouring from the ships, the stream"
15584,BOOK XIX.,"Of helmets polish’d bright, and bossy shields,"
15585,BOOK XIX.,"And breastplates firmly brac’d, and ashen spears:"
15586,BOOK XIX.,Their brightness flash’d to Heav’n; and laugh’d the Earth
15587,BOOK XIX.,Beneath the brazen glare; loud rang the tramp
15588,BOOK XIX.,"Of armed men: Achilles in the midst,"
15589,BOOK XIX.,"The godlike chief, in dazzling arms array’d."
15590,BOOK XIX.,His teeth were gnashing audibly; his eye
15591,BOOK XIX.,"Blaz’d with, the light of fire; but in his heart"
15592,BOOK XIX.,Was grief unbearable; with furious wrath
15593,BOOK XIX.,"He burn’d against the Trojans, as he donn’d"
15594,BOOK XIX.,"The heav’nly gifts, the work of Vulcan’s hand."
15595,BOOK XIX.,"First on his legs the well-wrought greaves he fix’d,"
15596,BOOK XIX.,Fasten’d with silver clasps; his breastplate next
15597,BOOK XIX.,Around his chest; and o’er his shoulders flung
15598,BOOK XIX.,"His silver-studded sword, with blade of brass;"
15599,BOOK XIX.,"Then took his vast and weighty shield, whence gleam’d"
15600,BOOK XIX.,A light refulgent as the full-orb’d moon;
15601,BOOK XIX.,Or as to seamen o’er the wave is borne
15602,BOOK XIX.,"The watchfire’s light, which, high among the hills,"
15603,BOOK XIX.,Some shepherd kindles in his lonely fold:
15604,BOOK XIX.,"As they, reluctant, by the stormy winds,"
15605,BOOK XIX.,Far from their friends are o’er the waters driv’n;
15606,BOOK XIX.,"So from Achilles’ shield, bright, richly wrought,"
15607,BOOK XIX.,"The light was thrown. The weighty helm he rais’d,"
15608,BOOK XIX.,And plac’d it on his head; the plumed helm
15609,BOOK XIX.,Shone like a star; and wav’d the hairs of gold.
15610,BOOK XIX.,Thick-set by Vulcan in the gleaming crest.
15611,BOOK XIX.,"Then all the arms Achilles prov’d, to know"
15612,BOOK XIX.,If well they fitted to his graceful limbs:
15613,BOOK XIX.,"Like wings, they seem’d to lift him from the ground."
15614,BOOK XIX.,"Last, from its case he drew his father’s spear,"
15615,BOOK XIX.,"Long, pond’rous, tough; not one of all the Greeks,"
15616,BOOK XIX.,"None, save Achilles’ self, could poise that spear;"
15617,BOOK XIX.,"The far-fam’d Pelian ash, which to his sire,"
15618,BOOK XIX.,"On Pelion’s summit fell’d, to be the bane"
15619,BOOK XIX.,"Of mighty chiefs, the Centaur Chiron gave."
15620,BOOK XIX.,With care Automedon and Alcimus
15621,BOOK XIX.,"The horses yok’d, with collars fair attach’d:"
15622,BOOK XIX.,"Plac’d in their mouths the bits, and pass’d the reins"
15623,BOOK XIX.,Back to the well-built car: Automedon
15624,BOOK XIX.,"Sprang on the car, with shining lash in hand:"
15625,BOOK XIX.,"Behind, Achilles came, array’d for war,"
15626,BOOK XIX.,"In arms all glitt’ring as the gorgeous sun,"
15627,BOOK XIX.,And loudly to his father’s steeds he call’d:
15628,BOOK XIX.,"“Xanthus and Balius, noble progeny"
15629,BOOK XIX.,"Of swift Podarge, now in other sort"
15630,BOOK XIX.,"Back to the Grecian ranks in safety bear,"
15631,BOOK XIX.,"When he shall quit the field, your charioteer;"
15632,BOOK XIX.,"Nor leave him, as ye left Patroclus, slain.”"
15633,BOOK XIX.,
15634,BOOK XIX.,To whom in answer from beneath the yoke
15635,BOOK XIX.,"Xanthus, the noble horse, with glancing feet:"
15636,BOOK XIX.,"Bowing his head the while, till all his mane"
15637,BOOK XIX.,"Down from th’ yokeband streaming, reach’d the ground;"
15638,BOOK XIX.,"By Juno, white-arm’d Queen, with speech endued:"
15639,BOOK XIX.,
15640,BOOK XIX.,"“Yes, great Achilles, we this day again"
15641,BOOK XIX.,Will bear thee safely; but thy day of doom
15642,BOOK XIX.,"Is nigh at hand; nor we shall cause thy death,"
15643,BOOK XIX.,"But Heav’n’s high will, and Fate’s imperious pow’r."
15644,BOOK XIX.,"By no default of ours, nor lack of speed,"
15645,BOOK XIX.,The Trojans stripp’d Patroclus of his arms:
15646,BOOK XIX.,"The mighty God, fair-hair’d Latona’s son,"
15647,BOOK XIX.,"Achiev’d his death, and Hector’s vict’ry gain’d."
15648,BOOK XIX.,"Our speed of foot may vie with Zephyr’s breeze,"
15649,BOOK XIX.,Deem’d swiftest of the winds; but thou art doom’d
15650,BOOK XIX.,"To die, by force combin’d of God and man.”"
15651,BOOK XIX.,
15652,BOOK XIX.,He said; his farther speech the Furies stay’d.
15653,BOOK XIX.,To whom in wrath Achilles swift of foot;
15654,BOOK XIX.,"“Xanthus, why thus predict my coming fate?"
15655,BOOK XIX.,It ill beseems thee! well I know myself
15656,BOOK XIX.,"That I am fated here in Troy to die,"
15657,BOOK XIX.,Far from my home and parents; yet withal
15658,BOOK XIX.,"I cease not, till these Trojans from the field"
15659,BOOK XIX.,"Before me fly.” He said, and to the front,"
15660,BOOK XIX.,"His war-cry shouting, urg’d his fiery steeds."

15710,BOOK XX.,"Upon Olympus’ lofty ridge remain,"
15711,BOOK XX.,"And view, serene, the combat; you, the rest,"
15712,BOOK XX.,"Go, as you list, to Trojans or to Greeks,"
15713,BOOK XX.,And at your pleasure either party aid.
15714,BOOK XX.,For if we leave Achilles thus alone
15715,BOOK XX.,"To fight against the Trojans, not an hour"
15716,BOOK XX.,Will they before the son of Peleus stand.
15717,BOOK XX.,"They dreaded him before; but now, I fear,"
15718,BOOK XX.,"Since rous’d to fury by his comrade’s death,"
15719,BOOK XX.,He e’en in fate’s despite may storm the wall.”
15720,BOOK XX.,
15721,BOOK XX.,"Thus Saturn’s son, and quenchless battle rous’d:"
15722,BOOK XX.,"The Gods, divided, hasten’d to the war:"
15723,BOOK XX.,"Juno and Pallas to the ships of Greece,"
15724,BOOK XX.,"With them th’ Earth-shaker, and the helpful God,"
15725,BOOK XX.,"Hermes, for cunning subtleties unmatch’d;"
15726,BOOK XX.,"And Vulcan too, exulting in his strength,"
15727,BOOK XX.,"Yet halting, and on feeble limbs sustain’d."
15728,BOOK XX.,"Mars of the glancing helm took part with Troy,"
15729,BOOK XX.,"And golden Phoebus with his locks unshorn,"
15730,BOOK XX.,"Latona too, and Dian, Archer-Queen,"
15731,BOOK XX.,"Xanthus, and Venus, laughter-loving dame."
15732,BOOK XX.,
15733,BOOK XX.,"While from the fight of men the Gods abstain’d,"
15734,BOOK XX.,"High rose the Grecian vaunts, as, long withdrawn,"
15735,BOOK XX.,Achilles on the field again appear’d:
15736,BOOK XX.,"And ev’ry Trojan’s limbs with terror quak’d,"
15737,BOOK XX.,"Trembling, as Peleus’ godlike son they saw,"
15738,BOOK XX.,"In arms all-glitt’ring, fierce as blood-stain’d Mars."
15739,BOOK XX.,"But when th’ Immortals mingled in the throng,"
15740,BOOK XX.,Then furious wax’d the spirit-stirring strife;
15741,BOOK XX.,"Then Pallas rais’d her war-cry, standing now"
15742,BOOK XX.,"Beside the deep-dug trench, without the wall,"
15743,BOOK XX.,Now shouting loud along the sounding beach.
15744,BOOK XX.,"On th’ other side, as with the tempest’s roar,"
15745,BOOK XX.,Mars to the Trojans shouted loud; one while
15746,BOOK XX.,From Ilium’s topmost height; anon again
15747,BOOK XX.,"From the fair hill, o’erhanging Simois’ stream."
15748,BOOK XX.,"Thus, either side exciting to the fray,"
15749,BOOK XX.,Th’ immortal Gods unchain’d the angry war.
15750,BOOK XX.,Thunder’d on high the Sire of Gods and men
15751,BOOK XX.,With awful din; while Neptune shook beneath
15752,BOOK XX.,"The boundless earth, and lofty mountain tops."
15753,BOOK XX.,The spring-abounding Ida quak’d and rock’d
15754,BOOK XX.,"From her firm basis to her loftiest peak,"
15755,BOOK XX.,"And Troy’s proud city, and the ships of Greece."
15756,BOOK XX.,"Pluto, th’ infernal monarch, heard alarm’d,"
15757,BOOK XX.,"And, springing from his throne, cried out in fear,"
15758,BOOK XX.,"Lest Neptune, breaking through the solid earth,"
15759,BOOK XX.,To mortals and Immortals should lay bare
15760,BOOK XX.,"His dark and drear abode, of Gods abhorr’d."
15761,BOOK XX.,Such was the shock when Gods in battle met;
15762,BOOK XX.,For there to royal Neptune stood oppos’d
15763,BOOK XX.,Phoebus Apollo with his arrows keen;
15764,BOOK XX.,The blue-ey’d Pallas to the God of War;
15765,BOOK XX.,"To Juno, Dian, heav’nly Archeress,"
15766,BOOK XX.,"Sister of Phoebus, golden-shafted Queen."
15767,BOOK XX.,"Stout Hermes, helpful God, Latona fac’d;"
15768,BOOK XX.,"While Vulcan met the mighty rolling stream,"
15769,BOOK XX.,"Xanthus by Gods, by men Scamander call’d."
15770,BOOK XX.,Thus Gods encounter’d Gods: Achilles’ soul
15771,BOOK XX.,Meantime was burning ’mid the throng to meet
15772,BOOK XX.,"Hector, the son of Priam; with whose blood"
15773,BOOK XX.,He long’d to glut th’ insatiate Lord of War.
15774,BOOK XX.,"Apollo then, the spirit-stirring God,"
15775,BOOK XX.,"Æneas mov’d Achilles to confront,"
15776,BOOK XX.,"And fill’d with courage high; and thus, the voice"
15777,BOOK XX.,"Assuming of Lycaon, Priam’s son,"
15778,BOOK XX.,"Apollo, son of Jove, the chief address’d:"
15779,BOOK XX.,
15780,BOOK XX.,"“Æneas, prince and councillor of Troy,"
15781,BOOK XX.,"Where are the vaunts, which o’er the wine-cup late"
15782,BOOK XX.,"Thou mad’st amid th’ assembled chiefs of Troy,"
15783,BOOK XX.,That hand to hand thou wouldst Achilles meet?”
15784,BOOK XX.,
15785,BOOK XX.,To whom Æneas thus in answer spoke:
15786,BOOK XX.,"“Why, son of Priam, urge me to contend,"
15787,BOOK XX.,"Against my will, with Peleus’ mighty son?"
15788,BOOK XX.,Not for the first time should I now engage
15789,BOOK XX.,"Achilles swift of foot: I met him once,"
15790,BOOK XX.,"And fled before his spear, on Ida’s hill,"
15791,BOOK XX.,When on our herds he fell; Lyrnessus then
15792,BOOK XX.,"He raz’d, and Pedasus; me Jove preserv’d,"
15793,BOOK XX.,"With strength, endowing, and with speed of foot."
15794,BOOK XX.,"Else had I fall’n beneath Achilles’ hand,"
15795,BOOK XX.,"By Pallas aided; who before him moves,"
15796,BOOK XX.,"Light of his life, and guides his brazen spear"
15797,BOOK XX.,Trojans and Leleges alike to slay.
15798,BOOK XX.,"’Tis not in mortal man with him to fight,"
15799,BOOK XX.,"Whom still some God attends, and guards from harm;"
15800,BOOK XX.,"And, e’en unaided, to the mark his spear"
15801,BOOK XX.,"Unerring flies, uncheck’d until it pierce"
15802,BOOK XX.,A warrior’s breast; yet if the Gods the scale
15803,BOOK XX.,"Impartial held, all brass-clad as he is,"
15804,BOOK XX.,O’er me no easy triumph should he gain.”
15805,BOOK XX.,
15806,BOOK XX.,"To whom the King Apollo, son of Jove:"
15807,BOOK XX.,"“Brave chief, do thou too to th’ immortal Gods"
15808,BOOK XX.,Address thy pray’r; men say that thou art sprung
15809,BOOK XX.,"From Venus, child of Jove; his mother owns"
15810,BOOK XX.,"A humbler origin; one born to Jove,"
15811,BOOK XX.,The other to the aged Ocean God.
15812,BOOK XX.,"On then with dauntless spear, nor be dismay’d"
15813,BOOK XX.,By his high tone and vaunting menaces.”
15814,BOOK XX.,
15815,BOOK XX.,"His words with courage fill’d the hero’s breast,"
15816,BOOK XX.,"And on he sprang, in dazzling arms arrayed;"
15817,BOOK XX.,"But not unmark’d of white-arm’d Juno pass’d,"
15818,BOOK XX.,"To meet Achilles, through the press of men,"
15819,BOOK XX.,"Who thus address’d the Gods, to council call’d:"
15820,BOOK XX.,
15821,BOOK XX.,"“Neptune and Pallas both, bethink ye well"
15822,BOOK XX.,"What now should be our course; Æneas comes,"
15823,BOOK XX.,"In dazzling arms array’d, to meet in fight"
15824,BOOK XX.,The son of Peleus; Phoebus sends him forth.
15825,BOOK XX.,"Say, then, shall we, encount’ring, to retreat"
15826,BOOK XX.,Perforce constrain him? or shall one of us
15827,BOOK XX.,"Beside Achilles stand, and give him strength"
15828,BOOK XX.,That he may nothing lack; and know himself
15829,BOOK XX.,By all the mightiest of th’ immortal Gods
15830,BOOK XX.,"Belov’d, and those how pow’rless, by whose aid"
15831,BOOK XX.,The Trojans yet maintain defensive war?
15832,BOOK XX.,"Therefore, to join the battle, came we all"
15833,BOOK XX.,"From high Olympus, that in this day’s fight"
15834,BOOK XX.,No ill befall him; though the time shall come
15835,BOOK XX.,"For him to meet the doom, by fate decreed,"
15836,BOOK XX.,When at his birth his thread of life was spun.
15837,BOOK XX.,But if Achilles from a voice divine
15838,BOOK XX.,"Receive not this assurance, he may well"
15839,BOOK XX.,"Be struck with fear, if haply to some God"
15840,BOOK XX.,He find himself oppos’d: ’tis hard for man
15841,BOOK XX.,"To meet, in presence visible, a God.”"
15842,BOOK XX.,
15843,BOOK XX.,To whom Earth-shaking Neptune thus replied:
15844,BOOK XX.,"“Juno, thine anger carry not too far;"
15845,BOOK XX.,It ill beseems thee. Not with my consent
15846,BOOK XX.,"Shall we, the stronger far, provoke to arms"
15847,BOOK XX.,"The other Gods; but rather, from the field"
15848,BOOK XX.,"Retiring, let us from on high survey,"
15849,BOOK XX.,"To mortals left, the turmoil of the war."
15850,BOOK XX.,"Should Mars or Phoebus then begin the fight,"
15851,BOOK XX.,"Or stay Achilles, and his arm restrain,"
15852,BOOK XX.,Then in the contest we too may engage;
15853,BOOK XX.,"And soon, methinks, will they be fain to join,"
15854,BOOK XX.,"Driv’n from the field, the Synod of the Gods,"
15855,BOOK XX.,Subdued perforce by our victorious hands.”
15856,BOOK XX.,
15857,BOOK XX.,The dark-hair’d monarch spoke; and led the way
15858,BOOK XX.,"To the high wall, by Trojans built of old,"
15859,BOOK XX.,"With Pallas’ aid, for godlike Hercules;"
15860,BOOK XX.,"Within whose circle he might safety seek,"
15861,BOOK XX.,When from the beach the monster of the deep
15862,BOOK XX.,"Might chase him toward the plain; there Neptune sat,"
15863,BOOK XX.,"And with him, the other Gods, a veil of cloud"
15864,BOOK XX.,Impenetrable around their shoulders spread.
15865,BOOK XX.,"On th’ other side, upon the fair hill’s brow,"
15866,BOOK XX.,Phoebus with Mars the fort-destroyer sat.
15867,BOOK XX.,"On either side they sat, each facing each"
15868,BOOK XX.,With hostile counsels; yet reluctant both
15869,BOOK XX.,To take th’ initiative of ruthless war;
15870,BOOK XX.,"Till Jove, enthron’d on high, the signal gave."
15871,BOOK XX.,"Then all the plain, with men and horses throng’d,"
15872,BOOK XX.,The brazen gleam illumin’d; rang the earth
15873,BOOK XX.,"Beneath their feet, as to the battle-shock"
15874,BOOK XX.,"They rush’d; but in the midst, both hosts between,"
15875,BOOK XX.,"Eager for fight, stood forth two warriors bold,"
15876,BOOK XX.,Proudly pre-eminent; Anchises’ son
15877,BOOK XX.,"Æneas, and Achilles’ godlike might."
15878,BOOK XX.,
15879,BOOK XX.,"Æneas first with threat’ning mien advanc’d,"
15880,BOOK XX.,Nodding his pond’rous helm; before his breast
15881,BOOK XX.,"His shield he bore, and pois’d his brazen spear."
15882,BOOK XX.,Him met Achilles from th’ opposing ranks;
15883,BOOK XX.,"Fierce as a rav’ning lion, whom to slay"
15884,BOOK XX.,"Pour forth the stalwart youths, th’ united strength"
15885,BOOK XX.,Of the rous’d village; he unheeding moves
15886,BOOK XX.,At first; but wounded by a jav’lin thrown
15887,BOOK XX.,"By some bold youth, he turns, with gaping jaws,"
15888,BOOK XX.,"And frothing fangs, collecting for the spring,"
15889,BOOK XX.,His breast too narrow for his mighty heart;
15890,BOOK XX.,And with his tail he lashes both his flanks
15891,BOOK XX.,"And sides, as though to rouse his utmost rage;"
15892,BOOK XX.,"Then on, in pride of strength, with glaring eyes"
15893,BOOK XX.,"He dashes, if some hunter he may slay,"
15894,BOOK XX.,Or in the foremost rank himself be slain.
15895,BOOK XX.,So mov’d his dauntless spirit Peleus’ son
15896,BOOK XX.,"Æneas to confront; when near they came,"
15897,BOOK XX.,"Thus first Achilles, swift of foot, began:"
15898,BOOK XX.,
15899,BOOK XX.,"“Æneas, why so far before the ranks"
15900,BOOK XX.,Advanc’d? dost thou presume with me to fight?
15901,BOOK XX.,Perchance expecting that the throne of Troy
15902,BOOK XX.,And Priam’s royal honours may be thine.
15903,BOOK XX.,"E’en if thou slay me, deem not to obtain"
15904,BOOK XX.,"Such boon from Priam; valiant sons are his,"
15905,BOOK XX.,"And he not weak, but bears a constant mind."
15906,BOOK XX.,Or have the Trojans set apart for thee
15907,BOOK XX.,"Some favour’d spot, the fairest of the land,"
15908,BOOK XX.,"Orchard or corn-land, shouldst thou work my death;"
15909,BOOK XX.,"Which thou shalt find, I trust, too hard a task?"
15910,BOOK XX.,Already hast thou fled before my spear;
15911,BOOK XX.,Hast thou forgotten how amid thy herds
15912,BOOK XX.,"Alone I found thee, and with flying foot"
15913,BOOK XX.,Pursued thee down the steep of Ida’s hill?
15914,BOOK XX.,"Nor didst thou dare to turn, or pause in flight."
15915,BOOK XX.,"Thou to Lyrnessus fledd’st; Lyrnessus I,"
15916,BOOK XX.,"With Pallas’ aid and Jove’s, assail’d and took:"
15917,BOOK XX.,"Their women thence, their days of freedom lost,"
15918,BOOK XX.,"I bore away, my captives; thee from death,"
15919,BOOK XX.,Jove and the other Gods defended then;
15920,BOOK XX.,"But will not now bestow, though such thy hope,"
15921,BOOK XX.,"Their succour; then I warn thee, while ’tis time,"
15922,BOOK XX.,"Ere ill betide thee, to the gen’ral throng"
15923,BOOK XX.,"That thou withdraw, nor stand to me oppos’d:"
15924,BOOK XX.,After th’ event may e’en a fool be wise.”
15925,BOOK XX.,
15926,BOOK XX.,To whom in answer thus Æneas spoke:
15927,BOOK XX.,"“Achilles, think not me, as though a fool,"
15928,BOOK XX.,To daunt with lofty speech; I too could well
15929,BOOK XX.,"With cutting words, and insult, answer thee."
15930,BOOK XX.,Each other’s race and parents well we know
15931,BOOK XX.,From tales of ancient days; although by sight
15932,BOOK XX.,"Nor mine to thee, nor thine to me are known."
15933,BOOK XX.,"To noble Peleus thou, ’tis said, wast born"
15934,BOOK XX.,"Of Thetis, fair-hair’d daughter of the sea;"
15935,BOOK XX.,"Of great Anchises, Heav’n-descended chief,"
15936,BOOK XX.,"I boast me sprung, to him by Venus borne."
15937,BOOK XX.,Of these shall one or other have this day
15938,BOOK XX.,To mourn their son; since not with empty words
15939,BOOK XX.,Shall thou and I from mortal combat part.
15940,BOOK XX.,"But if thou farther wouldst enquire, and learn"
15941,BOOK XX.,"The race I spring from, not unknown to men,"
15942,BOOK XX.,"By Dardanus, of cloud-compelling Jove"
15943,BOOK XX.,"Begotten, was Dardania peopled first,"
15944,BOOK XX.,"Ere sacred Ilium, populous city of men,"
15945,BOOK XX.,Was founded on the plain; as yet they dwelt
15946,BOOK XX.,On spring-abounding Ida’s lowest spurs.
15947,BOOK XX.,"To Dardanus was Erichthonius born,"
15948,BOOK XX.,"Great King, the wealthiest of the sons of men;"
15949,BOOK XX.,"For him were pastur’d in the marshy mead,"
15950,BOOK XX.,"Rejoicing with their foals, three thousand mares;"
15951,BOOK XX.,"Them Boreas, in the pasture where they fed,"
15952,BOOK XX.,"Beheld, enamour’d; and amid the herd"
15953,BOOK XX.,In likeness of a coal-black steed appear’d;
15954,BOOK XX.,"Twelve foals, by him conceiving, they produc’d."
15955,BOOK XX.,"These, o’er the teeming corn-fields as they flew,"
15956,BOOK XX.,"Skimm’d o’er the standing ears, nor broke the haulm;"
15957,BOOK XX.,"And, o’er wide Ocean’s bosom as they flew,"
15958,BOOK XX.,Skimm’d o’er the topmost spray of th’ hoary sea
15959,BOOK XX.,"Again, to Erichthonius Tros was born,"
15960,BOOK XX.,"The King of Troy; three noble sons were his,"
15961,BOOK XX.,"Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede;"
15962,BOOK XX.,The fairest he of all the sons of men;
15963,BOOK XX.,"Him, for his beauty, bore the Gods away,"
15964,BOOK XX.,"To minister as cup-bearer to Jove,"
15965,BOOK XX.,And dwell amid th’ Immortals: Ilus next
15966,BOOK XX.,"Begot a noble son, Laomedon;"
15967,BOOK XX.,"Tithonus he, and Priam; Clytius,"
15968,BOOK XX.,"Lampus and Icetaon, plant of Mars;"
15969,BOOK XX.,"Capys, begotten of Assaracus,"
15970,BOOK XX.,"Begot Anchises, and Anchises me:"
15971,BOOK XX.,To Priam godlike Hector owes his birth.
15972,BOOK XX.,"Such is my race, and such the blood I boast;"
15973,BOOK XX.,"But Jove, at will, to mortals valour gives"
15974,BOOK XX.,Or minishes; for he is Lord of all.
15975,BOOK XX.,"Then cease we now, like babbling fools, to prate"
15976,BOOK XX.,Here in the centre of the coming fight.
15977,BOOK XX.,"Terms of reproach we both might find, whose weight"
15978,BOOK XX.,Would sink a galley of a hundred oars;
15979,BOOK XX.,"For glibly runs the tongue, and can at will"
15980,BOOK XX.,Give utt’rance to discourse in ev’ry vein;
15981,BOOK XX.,Wide is the range of language; and such words
15982,BOOK XX.,"As one may speak, another may return."
15983,BOOK XX.,What need that we should insults interchange?
15984,BOOK XX.,"Like women, who some paltry quarrel wage,"
15985,BOOK XX.,"Scolding and brawling in the public street,"
15986,BOOK XX.,"And in opprobrious terms their anger vent,"
15987,BOOK XX.,"Some true, some false; for so their rage suggests."
15988,BOOK XX.,"With words thou shalt not turn me from the field,"
15989,BOOK XX.,Till we have met in arms; then try we now
15990,BOOK XX.,Each other’s prowess with our brazen spears.”
15991,BOOK XX.,
15992,BOOK XX.,"He said, and hurl’d against the mighty shield"
15993,BOOK XX.,His brazen spear; loud rang the weapon’s point;
15994,BOOK XX.,And at arm’s length Achilles held the shield
15995,BOOK XX.,"With his broad hand, in fear that through its folds"
15996,BOOK XX.,Æneas’ spear would easy passage find;
15997,BOOK XX.,Blind fool! forgetful that the glorious gifts
15998,BOOK XX.,"Bestow’d by Gods, are not with ease o’ercome,"
15999,BOOK XX.,Nor yield before th’ assaults of mortal men.
16000,BOOK XX.,
16001,BOOK XX.,"So broke not through Æneas’ sturdy spear,"
16002,BOOK XX.,"Stay’d by the golden plate, the gift of Heav’n;"
16003,BOOK XX.,"Yet through two plates it pass’d, but three remain’d,"
16004,BOOK XX.,For five were in the shield by Vulcan wrought;
16005,BOOK XX.,"Two were of brass, the inner two of tin,"
16006,BOOK XX.,"And one of gold, which stay’d the brazen spear."
16007,BOOK XX.,
16008,BOOK XX.,Achilles threw in turn his pond’rous spear.
16009,BOOK XX.,And struck the circle of Æneas’ shield
16010,BOOK XX.,"Near the first rim, where thinnest lay the brass,"
16011,BOOK XX.,And thinnest too th’ o’erlying hide; right through
16012,BOOK XX.,The Pelian shaft was driv’n; wide gap’d the shield.
16013,BOOK XX.,"Æneas crouch’d, in fear, as o’er his head"
16014,BOOK XX.,He held his shield; the eager weapon pass’d
16015,BOOK XX.,"Through both the circles of his ample shield,"
16016,BOOK XX.,"And in the ground, behind him, quiv’ring, stood."
16017,BOOK XX.,"Escap’d the pond’rous weapon, sharpest pain"
16018,BOOK XX.,"Flashing across his eyes, in fear he stood,"
16019,BOOK XX.,"So close the spear had pass’d him; onward then,"
16020,BOOK XX.,"Drawing his trenchant blade, Achilles rush’d,"
16021,BOOK XX.,With fearful shout; a rocky fragment then
16022,BOOK XX.,"Æneas lifted up, a mighty mass,"
16023,BOOK XX.,"Which scarce two men, as men are now, could bear,"
16024,BOOK XX.,"But he, unaided, lifted it with ease."
16025,BOOK XX.,"Then had Æneas, with the massive stone,"
16026,BOOK XX.,"Or on the helmet, or the shield, his death"
16027,BOOK XX.,"Averting, struck Achilles; and himself"
16028,BOOK XX.,"Had by the sword of Peleus’ son been slain,"
16029,BOOK XX.,"Had not th’ Earth-shaking God his peril seen,"
16030,BOOK XX.,And to th’ Immortals thus address’d his speech:
16031,BOOK XX.,"“Oh, woe is me for great Æneas’ sake,"
16032,BOOK XX.,"Who, by Achilles slain, must visit soon"
16033,BOOK XX.,"The viewless shades; insensate, who relied"
16034,BOOK XX.,On Phoebus’ words; yet nought shall he avail
16035,BOOK XX.,"From death to save him. Yet oh why should he,"
16036,BOOK XX.,"Blameless himself, the guilt of others rue?"
16037,BOOK XX.,Who still his grateful sacrifice hath paid
16038,BOOK XX.,To all the Gods in wide-spread Heav’n who dwell.
16039,BOOK XX.,Let us then interpose to guard his life;
16040,BOOK XX.,"Lest, if Achilles slay him, Saturn’s son"
16041,BOOK XX.,Be mov’d to anger; for his destiny
16042,BOOK XX.,"Would have him live; lest, heirless, from the earth"
16043,BOOK XX.,Should perish quite the race of Dardanus;
16044,BOOK XX.,By Saturn’s son the best-belov’d of all
16045,BOOK XX.,"His sons, to him by mortal women born."
16046,BOOK XX.,For Jove the race of Priam hath abhorr’d;
16047,BOOK XX.,"But o’er the Trojans shall Æneas reign,"
16048,BOOK XX.,"And his sons’ sons, through ages yet unborn.”"
16049,BOOK XX.,
16050,BOOK XX.,Whom answer’d thus the stag-ey’d Queen of Heav’n:
16051,BOOK XX.,"“Neptune, do thou determine for thyself"
16052,BOOK XX.,"Æneas to withdraw, or leave to fall,"
16053,BOOK XX.,"Good as he is, beneath Achilles’ sword;"
16054,BOOK XX.,"But we before th’ immortal Gods are bound,"
16055,BOOK XX.,"Both I and Pallas, by repeated oaths,"
16056,BOOK XX.,"Ne’er from his doom one Trojan life to save,"
16057,BOOK XX.,"Though to devouring flames a prey, all Troy"
16058,BOOK XX.,"Were blazing, kindled by the valiant Greeks.”"
16059,BOOK XX.,
16060,BOOK XX.,"Th’ Earth-shaker heard; and thro’ the fight he pass’d,"
16061,BOOK XX.,"And through the throng of spears, until he came"
16062,BOOK XX.,Where great Achilles and Æneas stood.
16063,BOOK XX.,Around the eyes of Peleus’ son he spread
16064,BOOK XX.,A veil of mist; then from Æneas’ shield
16065,BOOK XX.,"The brass-tipp’d spear withdrawing, laid it down"
16066,BOOK XX.,Before Achilles’ feet; and lifting up
16067,BOOK XX.,"Æneas, bore him high above the ground."
16068,BOOK XX.,O’er many a rank of warriors and of cars
16069,BOOK XX.,"Æneas flew, supported by the God;"
16070,BOOK XX.,"Till to the field’s extremest verge he came,"
16071,BOOK XX.,"Where stood the Caucons, arming for the war."
16072,BOOK XX.,"There to Æneas, standing by his side,"
16073,BOOK XX.,Th’ Earth-shaker thus his winged words address’d:
16074,BOOK XX.,"“Æneas, say what God has mov’d thee thus"
16075,BOOK XX.,"Against Achilles, reckless, to contend,"
16076,BOOK XX.,"Thy stronger far, and dearer to the Gods?"
16077,BOOK XX.,"If e’er he cross thy path, do thou retire,"
16078,BOOK XX.,"Lest, e’en despite of fate, thou find thy death."
16079,BOOK XX.,"But when Achilles hath to fate succumb’d,"
16080,BOOK XX.,"Then, fearless, with the foremost join the fray:"
16081,BOOK XX.,No other Greek shall bear away thy spoils.”
16082,BOOK XX.,
16083,BOOK XX.,"Thus plainly warn’d, Æneas there he left."
16084,BOOK XX.,Then from Achilles’ eyes he purg’d the film:
16085,BOOK XX.,"Astonish’d, he with eyes wide open gaz’d,"
16086,BOOK XX.,As thus he commun’d with his mighty heart:
16087,BOOK XX.,
16088,BOOK XX.,"“O Heav’n, what marvel do mine eyes behold?"
16089,BOOK XX.,"My spear before me laid, and vanish’d he"
16090,BOOK XX.,At whom I hurl’d it with intent to slay!
16091,BOOK XX.,Then is Æneas of th’ immortal Gods
16092,BOOK XX.,"In truth belov’d, though vain I deem’d his boast."
16093,BOOK XX.,A curse go with him! yet methinks not soon
16094,BOOK XX.,"Will he again presume to prove my might,"
16095,BOOK XX.,Who gladly now in flight escapes from death.
16096,BOOK XX.,"Then, to the valiant Greeks my orders giv’n."
16097,BOOK XX.,Let me some other Trojan’s mettle prove.”
16098,BOOK XX.,"Then tow’rd the ranks he sprang, each sev’ral man"
16099,BOOK XX.,"Exhorting: “From the Trojans, valiant Greeks,"
16100,BOOK XX.,No longer stand aloof; but man to man
16101,BOOK XX.,"Confront the foe, and nobly dare the fight."
16102,BOOK XX.,"’Twere hard for me, brave warrior though I be,"
16103,BOOK XX.,"To face such numbers, and to fight with all:"
16104,BOOK XX.,"Not Mars, nor Pallas, though immortal Gods,"
16105,BOOK XX.,"Could face, and vanquish, such a mighty mass."
16106,BOOK XX.,"But what my single arm, and feet, and strength"
16107,BOOK XX.,"May profit, not a jot will I relax;"
16108,BOOK XX.,Right through the ranks I mean to force my way;
16109,BOOK XX.,"And small shall be that Trojan’s cause for joy,"
16110,BOOK XX.,Who comes within the compass of my spear.”
16111,BOOK XX.,
16112,BOOK XX.,"Thus he, exhorting; Hector cheering on"
16113,BOOK XX.,"Meanwhile the Trojans, with assurance giv’n"
16114,BOOK XX.,That he himself Achilles would confront.
16115,BOOK XX.,
16116,BOOK XX.,"“Ye valiant Trojans, fear not Peleus’ son;"
16117,BOOK XX.,"I too in words could with the Gods contend,"
16118,BOOK XX.,Though not in arms; so much the stronger they.
16119,BOOK XX.,Not all his words Achilles shall make good;
16120,BOOK XX.,"Fulfilling some, in others he shall fail,"
16121,BOOK XX.,His course midway arrested. Him will I
16122,BOOK XX.,"Encounter, though his hands were hands of fire,"
16123,BOOK XX.,"Of fire his hands, his strength as burnish’d steel.”"
16124,BOOK XX.,
16125,BOOK XX.,"Thus he, exhorting; with uplifted spears"
16126,BOOK XX.,Advanc’d the Trojans; from the mingling hosts
16127,BOOK XX.,Loud rose the clamour; then at Hector’s side
16128,BOOK XX.,"Apollo stood, and thus address’d the chief:"
16129,BOOK XX.,"“Hector, forbear Achilles to defy;"
16130,BOOK XX.,And ’mid the crowd withdraw thee from the fray;
16131,BOOK XX.,"Lest with the spear he slay thee, thrown from far,"
16132,BOOK XX.,Or with the sword in combat hand to hand.”
16133,BOOK XX.,
16134,BOOK XX.,"He said; and troubled by the heav’nly voice,"
16135,BOOK XX.,Hector amid the throng of men withdrew.
16136,BOOK XX.,
16137,BOOK XX.,"Then, girt with might, amid the Trojans sprang,"
16138,BOOK XX.,"With fearful shouts, Achilles; first he slew"
16139,BOOK XX.,"Otryntes’ son, Iphition, valiant chief"
16140,BOOK XX.,"Of num’rous warriors; him a Naiad nymph,"
16141,BOOK XX.,"In Hyde’s fertile vale, beneath the feet"
16142,BOOK XX.,"Of snow-clad Tmolus, to Otryntes bore;"
16143,BOOK XX.,"At him, as on he rush’d, Achilles hurl’d,"
16144,BOOK XX.,And through his forehead drove his glitt’ring spear;
16145,BOOK XX.,"The head was cleft in twain; thund’ring he fell,"
16146,BOOK XX.,And o’er him thus Achilles made his boast:
16147,BOOK XX.,
16148,BOOK XX.,"“Son of Otryntes, lie thou there, of men"
16149,BOOK XX.,"The most vain-glorious; here thou find’st thy death,"
16150,BOOK XX.,"Far from thy place of birth, beside the lake"
16151,BOOK XX.,Gygaean; there hadst thou thine heritage
16152,BOOK XX.,"Of old, beside the fish-abounding stream"
16153,BOOK XX.,"Of Hyllus, and by Hermus’ eddying flood.”"
16154,BOOK XX.,
16155,BOOK XX.,"Thus he, exulting: o’er Iphition’s eyes"
16156,BOOK XX.,Were spread the shades of death; his mangled corpse
16157,BOOK XX.,"Was crush’d beneath the Grecian chariot wheels,"
16158,BOOK XX.,"In the first shock. Demoleon next he smote,"
16159,BOOK XX.,"A helpful aid in war, Antenor’s son,"
16160,BOOK XX.,"Pierc’d thro’ the temples, thro’ the brass-bound helm;"
16161,BOOK XX.,"Nor check’d the brazen helm the spear, whose point"
16162,BOOK XX.,"Went crashing through the bone, that all the brain"
16163,BOOK XX.,"Was shatter’d; onward as he rush’d, he fell."
16164,BOOK XX.,"Then through the neck Hippodamas he smote,"
16165,BOOK XX.,"Flying before him, mounted on his car."
16166,BOOK XX.,"Deep groan’d he, breathing out his soul, as groans"
16167,BOOK XX.,"A bull, by sturdy youths to th’ altar dragg’d"
16168,BOOK XX.,"Of Neptune, King divine of Helice;"
16169,BOOK XX.,"Th’ Earth-shaking God, well pleas’d, the gift receives;"
16170,BOOK XX.,E’en with such groans his noble spirit fled.
16171,BOOK XX.,"The godlike Polydore he next assail’d,"
16172,BOOK XX.,The son of Priam; him his aged sire
16173,BOOK XX.,"Would fain have kept at home, of all his sons"
16174,BOOK XX.,At once the youngest and the best-belov’d;
16175,BOOK XX.,Among them all for speed of foot unmatch’d;
16176,BOOK XX.,"Whose youthful folly, in the foremost ranks"
16177,BOOK XX.,"His speed displaying, cost him now his life."
16178,BOOK XX.,"Him, as he darted by, Achilles’ spear"
16179,BOOK XX.,"Struck through the centre of the back, where met"
16180,BOOK XX.,"The golden clasps that held the glitt’ring belt,"
16181,BOOK XX.,And where the breastplate form’d a double guard:
16182,BOOK XX.,Right through his body pass’d the weapon’s point;
16183,BOOK XX.,"Groaning, he fell upon his knees; dark clouds"
16184,BOOK XX.,O’erspread his eyes; supporting with his hand
16185,BOOK XX.,"His wounded bowels, on the ground he writh’d."
16186,BOOK XX.,When Hector saw his brother Polydore
16187,BOOK XX.,"Writhing in death, a mist o’erspread his eyes"
16188,BOOK XX.,"Nor longer could he bear to stand aloof,"
16189,BOOK XX.,"But sprang to meet Achilles, flashing fire,"
16190,BOOK XX.,His keen spear brandishing; at sight of him
16191,BOOK XX.,"Up leap’d Achilles, and exulting cried:"
16192,BOOK XX.,
16193,BOOK XX.,"“Lo, here the man who most hath wrung my soul,"
16194,BOOK XX.,"Who slew my lov’d companion: now, methinks,"
16195,BOOK XX.,Upon the pass of war not long shall we
16196,BOOK XX.,"Stand separate, nor each the other shun.”"
16197,BOOK XX.,
16198,BOOK XX.,"Then, with stern glance, to godlike Hector thus:"
16199,BOOK XX.,"“Draw near, and quickly meet thy doom of death.”"
16200,BOOK XX.,
16201,BOOK XX.,"To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm,"
16202,BOOK XX.,"Unterrified: “Achilles, think not me,"
16203,BOOK XX.,"As though a fool and ignorant of war,"
16204,BOOK XX.,To daunt with lofty speech; I too could well
16205,BOOK XX.,With cutting words and insult answer thee.
16206,BOOK XX.,I know thee strong and valiant; and I know
16207,BOOK XX.,Myself to thee inferior; but th’ event
16208,BOOK XX.,"Is with the Gods; and I, if such their will,"
16209,BOOK XX.,"The weaker, with my spear may reach thy life:"
16210,BOOK XX.,"My point too hath, ere now, its sharpness prov’d.”"
16211,BOOK XX.,
16212,BOOK XX.,"He said, and, poising, hurl’d his pond’rous spear,"
16213,BOOK XX.,Which from Achilles Pallas turn’d aside
16214,BOOK XX.,"With lightest breath; and back to Hector sent,"
16215,BOOK XX.,"And laid before his feet; intent to slay,"
16216,BOOK XX.,"Onward Achilles rush’d, with fearful shout;"
16217,BOOK XX.,"But Phoebus Hector from the field convey’d,"
16218,BOOK XX.,"(As Gods can only,) veil’d in thickest cloud."
16219,BOOK XX.,"Thrice Peleus’ godlike son, with brazen spear,"
16220,BOOK XX.,His onset made; thrice struck the misty cloud;
16221,BOOK XX.,"But when, with pow’r as of a God, he made"
16222,BOOK XX.,"His fourth essay, in fury thus he cried:"
16223,BOOK XX.,
16224,BOOK XX.,"“Yet once again, vile hound, hast thou escap’d;"
16225,BOOK XX.,"Thy doom was nigh, but thee thy God hath sav’d,"
16226,BOOK XX.,"Phoebus, to whom, amid the clash of spears,"
16227,BOOK XX.,Well mayst thou pray! We yet shall meet again;
16228,BOOK XX.,"When I shall end thee, if a guardian God"
16229,BOOK XX.,"I too may claim; meanwhile, from thee I turn,"
16230,BOOK XX.,And others seek on whom my hap may light.”
16231,BOOK XX.,
16232,BOOK XX.,"He said, and drove through Dryops’ neck his spear,"
16233,BOOK XX.,"And stretch’d him at his feet, and pass’d him by."
16234,BOOK XX.,Next with his spear he struck below the knee
16235,BOOK XX.,"Philetor’s son, Demuchus, stout and tall,"
16236,BOOK XX.,And check’d his forward course; then rushing on
16237,BOOK XX.,Dealt with his mighty sword the mortal blow.
16238,BOOK XX.,"The sons of Bias next, Laogonus"
16239,BOOK XX.,"And Dardanus, he hurl’d from off their car,"
16240,BOOK XX.,"One with the spear, and one by sword-stroke slain."
16241,BOOK XX.,"Tros too he slew, Alastor’s son, who came"
16242,BOOK XX.,"To meet him, and embrace his knees, and pray"
16243,BOOK XX.,"To spare his life, in pity of his youth:"
16244,BOOK XX.,Little he knew how vain would be his pray’r;
16245,BOOK XX.,"For not of temper soft, nor mild of mood"
16246,BOOK XX.,"Was he, but sternly fierce; and as he knelt"
16247,BOOK XX.,"And clasp’d his knees, and would his pray’r prefer,"
16248,BOOK XX.,"Achilles clove him with his mighty sword,"
16249,BOOK XX.,Gash’d through the liver; as from out the wound
16250,BOOK XX.,"His liver dropp’d, the dark blood gushing forth"
16251,BOOK XX.,"His bosom fill’d, and darkness clos’d his eyes,"
16252,BOOK XX.,As ebb’d his life away. Then through the ear
16253,BOOK XX.,Mulius he thrust; at th’ other ear came forth
16254,BOOK XX.,"The brazen point. Echeclus next he met,"
16255,BOOK XX.,"Son of Agenor, and his hilted sword"
16256,BOOK XX.,Full on the centre of his head let fall.
16257,BOOK XX.,The hot blood dy’d the blade; the darkling shades
16258,BOOK XX.,"Of death, and rig’rous fate, his eyes o’erspread."
16259,BOOK XX.,"Next, where the tendons bind the elbow-joint,"
16260,BOOK XX.,The brazen spear transfix’d Deucalion’s arm;
16261,BOOK XX.,"With death in prospect, and disabled arm"
16262,BOOK XX.,"He stood, till on his neck Achilles’ sword"
16263,BOOK XX.,"Descending, shar’d, and flung afar, both head"
16264,BOOK XX.,And helmet; from the spine’s dissever’d joints
16265,BOOK XX.,"The marrow flow’d, as stretch’d in dust he lay."
16266,BOOK XX.,"The noble son of Peireus next he slew,"
16267,BOOK XX.,"Rigmus, who came from Thracia’s fertile plains;"
16268,BOOK XX.,"Him through the waist he struck, the brazen spear"
16269,BOOK XX.,Plung’d in his bowels; from the car he fell;
16270,BOOK XX.,"And as Areithous, his charioteer,"
16271,BOOK XX.,"His horses turn’d, Achilles through the neck"
16272,BOOK XX.,"His sharp spear thrusting, hurl’d him to the ground,"
16273,BOOK XX.,The startled steeds in wild confusion thrown.
16274,BOOK XX.,
16275,BOOK XX.,As rage the fires amid the wooded glen
16276,BOOK XX.,"Of some parch’d mountain’s side, and fiercely burns"
16277,BOOK XX.,"The copse-wood dry, while eddying here and there"
16278,BOOK XX.,The flames are whirl’d before the gusty wind;
16279,BOOK XX.,"So fierce Achilles raged, on ev’ry side"
16280,BOOK XX.,"Pursuing, slaught’ring; reek’d the earth with blood."
16281,BOOK XX.,"As when upon a well-roll’d threshing-floor,"
16282,BOOK XX.,"Two sturdy-fronted steers, together yok’d,"
16283,BOOK XX.,Tread the white barley out; beneath their feet
16284,BOOK XX.,Fast flies the grain out-trodden from the husk;
16285,BOOK XX.,"So by Achilles driv’n, his flying steeds"
16286,BOOK XX.,"His chariot bore, o’er bodies of the slain"
16287,BOOK XX.,And broken bucklers trampling; all beneath
16288,BOOK XX.,"Was plash’d with blood the axle, and the rails"
16289,BOOK XX.,"Around the car, as from the horses’ feet"
16290,BOOK XX.,And from the felloes of the wheels were thrown
16291,BOOK XX.,"The bloody gouts; and onward still he press’d,"
16292,BOOK XX.,"Panting for added triumphs, deeply dyed"
16293,BOOK XX.,With gore and carnage his unconquer’d hands.

16341,BOOK XXI.,"Arm’d with his sword alone, a God in pow’r,"
16342,BOOK XXI.,He sprang amid the torrent; right and left
16343,BOOK XXI.,He smote; then fearful rose the groans of men
16344,BOOK XXI.,Slain with the sword; the stream ran red with blood.
16345,BOOK XXI.,"As fishes, flying from a dolphin, crowd"
16346,BOOK XXI.,"The shoal recesses of some open bay,"
16347,BOOK XXI.,"In fear, for whom he catches he devours;"
16348,BOOK XXI.,So crouch’d the Trojans in the mighty stream
16349,BOOK XXI.,Beneath the banks; and when at length his hand
16350,BOOK XXI.,"Wearied of slaughter, from the stream, alive,"
16351,BOOK XXI.,"He dragg’d twelve youths, whose forfeit lives should be"
16352,BOOK XXI.,The bloody fine for slain Patroclus paid.

16354,BOOK XXI.,Their hands secur’d behind them with the belts
16355,BOOK XXI.,"Which o’er their shirts of twisted mail they wore,"

16359,BOOK XXI.,"Lycaon, Priam’s son; him once before"

16390,BOOK XXI.,
16391,BOOK XXI.,"Thus, as he stood, he mus’d; but all aghast"

16394,BOOK XXI.,Escape from bitter death and evil fate.
16395,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles rais’d his spear, in act to strike;"
16396,BOOK XXI.,"He, stooping, ran beneath, and clasp’d his knees;"

16401,BOOK XXI.,"As he with winged words, imploring, spoke:"

16409,BOOK XXI.,"Far from my sire and friends, in Lemnos’ isle."
16410,BOOK XXI.,A hundred oxen were my ransom then;
16411,BOOK XXI.,At thrice so much I now would buy my life.
16412,BOOK XXI.,"This day is but the twelfth, since, sorely tried"
16413,BOOK XXI.,"By lengthen’d suffering, back to Troy I came."
16414,BOOK XXI.,Now to thy hands once more my cruel fate

16420,BOOK XXI.,"In lofty Pedasus, by Satnois’ stream."
16421,BOOK XXI.,His child of Priam’s many wives was one;
16422,BOOK XXI.,"Two sons she bore, and both by thee must die."
16423,BOOK XXI.,"Already one, the godlike Polydore,"
16424,BOOK XXI.,Amid the foremost ranks thy spear hath slain;
16425,BOOK XXI.,"And now my doom hath found me; for from thee,"
16426,BOOK XXI.,"Since evil fate hath plac’d me in thy hands,"
16427,BOOK XXI.,"I may not hope to fly; yet hear but this,"
16428,BOOK XXI.,"And weigh it in thy mind, to spare my life:"
16429,BOOK XXI.,"I come not of that womb which Hector bore,"
16430,BOOK XXI.,"Who slew thy comrade, gentle, kind, and brave.”"
16431,BOOK XXI.,
16432,BOOK XXI.,"Thus Priam’s noble son, imploring, spoke;"
16433,BOOK XXI.,But stern the answer fell upon his ear:
16434,BOOK XXI.,
16435,BOOK XXI.,“Thou fool! no more to me of ransom prate!
16436,BOOK XXI.,"Before Patroclus met the doom of death,"
16437,BOOK XXI.,To spare the Trojans still my soul inclin’d;
16438,BOOK XXI.,"And many captives, ta’en alive, I sold;"
16439,BOOK XXI.,"But from henceforth, before the walls of Troy,"
16440,BOOK XXI.,"Not one of all the Trojans, whom the Gods"
16441,BOOK XXI.,"May to my hands deliver, least of all"
16442,BOOK XXI.,"A son of Priam, shall escape the death."
16443,BOOK XXI.,"Thou too, my friend, must die: why vainly wail?"
16444,BOOK XXI.,"Dead is Patroclus too, thy better far."
16445,BOOK XXI.,"Me too thou see’st, how stalwart, tall, and fair,"
16446,BOOK XXI.,"Of noble sire, and Goddess-mother born:"
16447,BOOK XXI.,"Yet must I yield to death and stubborn fate,"
16448,BOOK XXI.,"Whene’er, at morn, or noon, or eve, the spear"
16449,BOOK XXI.,Or arrow from the bow may reach my life.”
16450,BOOK XXI.,
16451,BOOK XXI.,He said; and sank Lycaon’s limbs and heart;
16452,BOOK XXI.,"He loos’d the spear, and sat, with both his hands"
16453,BOOK XXI.,"Uprais’d, imploring; but Achilles drew,"
16454,BOOK XXI.,And on his neck beside the collar-bone
16455,BOOK XXI.,Let fall his trenchant sword; the two-edg’d blade
16456,BOOK XXI.,Was buried deep; prone on the earth he lay;
16457,BOOK XXI.,"Forth gush’d the crimson blood, and dyed the ground."
16458,BOOK XXI.,
16459,BOOK XXI.,"Him, dragging by the feet, Achilles threw"
16460,BOOK XXI.,"In the mid stream, and thus with vaunting speech:"
16461,BOOK XXI.,
16462,BOOK XXI.,"“Lie there amid the fishes, who shall cleanse,"
16463,BOOK XXI.,"But not with kindly thought, thy gory wounds:"
16464,BOOK XXI.,"O’er thee, extended on thy bier, shall rise"
16465,BOOK XXI.,No mother’s wail; Scamander’s eddying stream
16466,BOOK XXI.,Shall to the sea’s broad bosom roll thee down;
16467,BOOK XXI.,"And, springing through the darkly rippling wave,"
16468,BOOK XXI.,"Fishes shall rise, and banquet on thy flesh."
16469,BOOK XXI.,"On now the work of death! till, flying ye,"
16470,BOOK XXI.,"And slaught’ring I, we reach the city wall."
16471,BOOK XXI.,"Nor this fair-flowing, silver-eddying stream,"
16472,BOOK XXI.,"Shall aught avail ye, though to him ye pay"
16473,BOOK XXI.,"In sacrifice the blood of countless bulls,"
16474,BOOK XXI.,And living horses in his waters sink.
16475,BOOK XXI.,"Ye all shall perish, till Patroclus’ death"
16476,BOOK XXI.,"Be fully aveng’d, and slaughter of the Greeks,"
16477,BOOK XXI.,"Whom, in my absence, by the ships ye slew.”"
16478,BOOK XXI.,He said: the mighty River at his words
16479,BOOK XXI.,"Indignant chaf’d, and ponder’d in his mind"
16480,BOOK XXI.,"How best to check Achilles’ warlike toil,"
16481,BOOK XXI.,And from destruction guard the Trojan host.
16482,BOOK XXI.,
16483,BOOK XXI.,Meantime Achilles with his pond’rous spear
16484,BOOK XXI.,"Asteropaeus, son of Pelegon,"
16485,BOOK XXI.,Assail’d with deadly purpose; Pelegon
16486,BOOK XXI.,"To broadly-flowing Axius ow’d his birth,"
16487,BOOK XXI.,The River-God commingling with the blood
16488,BOOK XXI.,"Of Periboea, daughter eldest born"
16489,BOOK XXI.,Of Acessamenus: on him he sprang;
16490,BOOK XXI.,"He, from the river rising, stood oppos’d."
16491,BOOK XXI.,Two lances in his hand; his courage rous’d
16492,BOOK XXI.,"By Xanthus, who, indignant, saw his stream"
16493,BOOK XXI.,"Polluted by the blood of slaughter’d youths,"
16494,BOOK XXI.,"By fierce Achilles’ hand, unpitying, slain."
16495,BOOK XXI.,"When near the warriors, each to other, came,"
16496,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles, swift of foot, took up the word:"
16497,BOOK XXI.,"“What man, and whence art thou, who dar’st to stand"
16498,BOOK XXI.,Oppos’d to me? of most unhappy sires
16499,BOOK XXI.,"The children they, who my encounter meet!”"
16500,BOOK XXI.,
16501,BOOK XXI.,To whom th’ illustrious son of Pelegon:
16502,BOOK XXI.,"“Great son of Peleus, why enquire my race?"
16503,BOOK XXI.,"From far Paeonia’s fertile fields I come,"
16504,BOOK XXI.,The leader of the long-spear’d Paeon host.
16505,BOOK XXI.,Ten days have pass’d since I to Ilium came.
16506,BOOK XXI.,"From widely-flowing Axius my descent,"
16507,BOOK XXI.,"Axius, the purest stream on earth that flows."
16508,BOOK XXI.,"He Pelegon begot, the spear-renown’d;"
16509,BOOK XXI.,Of Pelegon I boast me sprung; and now
16510,BOOK XXI.,"Address thee, brave Achilles, to the fight.”"
16511,BOOK XXI.,
16512,BOOK XXI.,Threat’ning he spoke: Achilles rais’d on high
16513,BOOK XXI.,"The Pelian spear; but, ambidexter, he"
16514,BOOK XXI.,From either hand at once a jav’lin launch’d.
16515,BOOK XXI.,"One struck, but pierc’d not through, the mighty shield,"
16516,BOOK XXI.,"Stay’d by the golden plate, the gift of Heav’n;"
16517,BOOK XXI.,Achilles’ right fore-arm the other graz’d:
16518,BOOK XXI.,"Forth gush’d the crimson blood; but, glancing by"
16519,BOOK XXI.,"And vainly longing for the taste of flesh,"
16520,BOOK XXI.,The point behind him in the earth was fix’d.
16521,BOOK XXI.,Then at Asteropaeus in his turn
16522,BOOK XXI.,With deadly intent the son of Peleus threw
16523,BOOK XXI.,"His straight-directed spear; his mark he miss’d,"
16524,BOOK XXI.,"But struck the lofty bank, where, deep infix’d"
16525,BOOK XXI.,"To half its length, the Pelian ash remain’d."
16526,BOOK XXI.,Then from beside his thigh Achilles drew
16527,BOOK XXI.,"His trenchant blade, and, furious, onward rush’d;"
16528,BOOK XXI.,While from the cliff Asteropaeus strove
16529,BOOK XXI.,"In vain, with stalwart hand, to wrench the spear."
16530,BOOK XXI.,"Three times he shook it with impetuous force,"
16531,BOOK XXI.,Three times relax’d his grasp; a fourth attempt
16532,BOOK XXI.,He made to bend and break the sturdy shaft;
16533,BOOK XXI.,"But him, preventing, Peleus’ godlike son"
16534,BOOK XXI.,"With deadly stroke across the belly smote,"
16535,BOOK XXI.,And gush’d his bowels forth; upon the ground
16536,BOOK XXI.,"Gasping he lay, and darkness seal’d his eyes."
16537,BOOK XXI.,"Then on his breast Achilles sprang, and stripp’d"
16538,BOOK XXI.,"His armour off, and thus with vaunting speech:"
16539,BOOK XXI.,"“So lie thou there! ’tis hard for thee to fight,"
16540,BOOK XXI.,"Though river-born, against the progeny"
16541,BOOK XXI.,Of mighty Jove; a widely-flowing stream
16542,BOOK XXI.,Thou claim’st as author of thy parentage;
16543,BOOK XXI.,My high descent from Jove himself I boast.
16544,BOOK XXI.,"My father Peleus, son of Æacus,"
16545,BOOK XXI.,Reigns o’er the num’rous race of Myrmidons;
16546,BOOK XXI.,The son of Jove himself was Æacus.
16547,BOOK XXI.,"High o’er all rivers, that to th’ ocean flow,"
16548,BOOK XXI.,Is Jove exalted; and in like degree
16549,BOOK XXI.,Superior is his race in pow’r to theirs.
16550,BOOK XXI.,"A mighty River hast thou here at hand,"
16551,BOOK XXI.,If that might aught avail thee; but his pow’r
16552,BOOK XXI.,Is impotent to strive with Saturn’s son.
16553,BOOK XXI.,"With him, not Achelous, King of streams,"
16554,BOOK XXI.,Presumes to vie; nor e’en the mighty strength
16555,BOOK XXI.,"Of deeply-flowing, wide Oceanus;"
16556,BOOK XXI.,"From whom all rivers, all the boundless sea,"
16557,BOOK XXI.,"All fountains, all deep wells derive their source;"
16558,BOOK XXI.,"Yet him appals the lightning bolt of Jove,"
16559,BOOK XXI.,"And thunder, pealing from the vault of Heav’n.”"
16560,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and from the cliff withdrew his spear."
16561,BOOK XXI.,Him left he lifeless there upon the sand
16562,BOOK XXI.,"Extended; o’er him the dark waters wash’d,"
16563,BOOK XXI.,"And eels and fishes, thronging, gnaw’d his flesh."
16564,BOOK XXI.,"Then ’mid the Paeons’ plumed host he rush’d,"
16565,BOOK XXI.,"Who fled along the eddying stream, when him,"
16566,BOOK XXI.,"Their bravest in the stubborn fight, they saw"
16567,BOOK XXI.,Slain by the sword and arm of Peleus’ son.
16568,BOOK XXI.,"Thersilochus and Mydon then he slew,"
16569,BOOK XXI.,"Mnesus and Thrasius and Astypylus,"
16570,BOOK XXI.,Ænius and Ophelestes; and yet more
16571,BOOK XXI.,"Had been the slaughter by Achilles wrought,"
16572,BOOK XXI.,"But from his eddying depths, in human form,"
16573,BOOK XXI.,With wrathful tone the mighty River spoke:
16574,BOOK XXI.,
16575,BOOK XXI.,"“In strength, Achilles, and in deeds of arms,"
16576,BOOK XXI.,All mortals thou surpassest; for the Gods
16577,BOOK XXI.,"Themselves attend thee, and protect from harm;"
16578,BOOK XXI.,If Saturn’s son have given thee utterly
16579,BOOK XXI.,"The Trojans to destroy, yet, ere thou slay,"
16580,BOOK XXI.,Far from my waters drive them o’er the plain;
16581,BOOK XXI.,For now my lovely stream is fill’d with dead;
16582,BOOK XXI.,"Nor can I pour my current to the sea,"
16583,BOOK XXI.,"With floating corpses chok’d, whilst thou pursuest"
16584,BOOK XXI.,"The work of death, insatiate: stay thy hand!"
16585,BOOK XXI.,"With horror I behold thee, mighty chief!”"
16586,BOOK XXI.,
16587,BOOK XXI.,"Whom answer’d thus Achilles, swift of foot:"
16588,BOOK XXI.,"“Be it as thou wilt, Scamander, Heav’n-born stream;"
16589,BOOK XXI.,Yet cease I not to slay until I drive
16590,BOOK XXI.,"These vaunting Trojans to their walls, and prove"
16591,BOOK XXI.,"The force of Hector, if, in single fight,"
16592,BOOK XXI.,"I be by him, or he by me, subdued.”"
16593,BOOK XXI.,
16594,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and fiercely on the Trojans rush’d,"
16595,BOOK XXI.,A God in might! to Phoebus then his speech
16596,BOOK XXI.,The deeply-eddying River thus address’d:
16597,BOOK XXI.,
16598,BOOK XXI.,"“God of the silver bow, great son of Jove,"
16599,BOOK XXI.,"Obey’st thou thus the will of Saturn’s son,"
16600,BOOK XXI.,"Who charg’d thee by the Trojans still to stand,"
16601,BOOK XXI.,"And aid their cause, till ev’ning’s late approach"
16602,BOOK XXI.,Should cast its shadows o’er the fertile earth?”
16603,BOOK XXI.,
16604,BOOK XXI.,"Thus as he spoke, from off the lofty bank"
16605,BOOK XXI.,Achilles springing in mid current plung’d;
16606,BOOK XXI.,"Then high the swelling stream, tumultuous, rose"
16607,BOOK XXI.,In all its angry flood; and with a roar
16608,BOOK XXI.,"As of a bellowing bull, cast forth to land"
16609,BOOK XXI.,The num’rous corpses by Achilles slain;
16610,BOOK XXI.,"And many living, in his cavern’d bed,"
16611,BOOK XXI.,Conceal’d behind the whirling waters sav’d.
16612,BOOK XXI.,"Fierce, round Achilles, rose the boiling wave,"
16613,BOOK XXI.,"And on his shield descending, drove him down;"
16614,BOOK XXI.,Nor might he keep his foothold; but he grasp’d
16615,BOOK XXI.,"A lofty elm, well-grown, which from the cliff"
16616,BOOK XXI.,"Uprooted, all the bank had torn away,"
16617,BOOK XXI.,And with its tangled branches check’d the flow
16618,BOOK XXI.,"Of the fair river, which with all its length"
16619,BOOK XXI.,"It bridg’d across; then, springing from the deep,"
16620,BOOK XXI.,Swiftly he fled in terror o’er the plain.
16621,BOOK XXI.,"Nor ceas’d the mighty River, but pursued,"
16622,BOOK XXI.,"With darkly-ruffling crest, intent to stay"
16623,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles’ course, and save the Trojan host."
16624,BOOK XXI.,"Far as a jav’lin’s flight he rush’d, in speed"
16625,BOOK XXI.,"Like the dark hunter eagle, strongest deem’d,"
16626,BOOK XXI.,And swiftest wing’d of all the feather’d race.
16627,BOOK XXI.,So on he sped; loud rattled on his breast
16628,BOOK XXI.,"His brazen armour, as before the God,"
16629,BOOK XXI.,"Cow’ring, he fled; the God behind him still"
16630,BOOK XXI.,With thund’ring sound pursued. As when a man
16631,BOOK XXI.,"From some dark-water’d spring through trenches leads,"
16632,BOOK XXI.,"’Mid plants and gardens, th’ irrigating stream,"
16633,BOOK XXI.,"And, spade in hand, th’ appointed channel clears:"
16634,BOOK XXI.,"Down flows the stream anon, its pebbly bed"
16635,BOOK XXI.,"Disturbing; fast it flows with bubbling sound,"
16636,BOOK XXI.,"Down the steep slope, o’ertaking him who leads."
16637,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles so th’ advancing wave o’ertook,"
16638,BOOK XXI.,"Though great his speed; but man must yield to Gods,"
16639,BOOK XXI.,"Oft as Achilles, swift of foot, essay’d"
16640,BOOK XXI.,"To turn and stand, and know if all the Gods,"
16641,BOOK XXI.,"Who dwell in Heav’n, were leagued to daunt his soul"
16642,BOOK XXI.,So oft the Heav’n-born River’s mighty wave
16643,BOOK XXI.,Above his shoulders dash’d; in deep distress
16644,BOOK XXI.,"He sprang on high; then rush’d the flood below,"
16645,BOOK XXI.,"And bore him off his legs, and wore away"
16646,BOOK XXI.,"The soil beneath his feet; then, groaning, thus,"
16647,BOOK XXI.,"As up to Heav’n he look’d, Achilles cried:"
16648,BOOK XXI.,"“O Father Jove, will none of all the Gods"
16649,BOOK XXI.,In pity save me from this angry flood?
16650,BOOK XXI.,"Content, thereafter, would I meet my fate."
16651,BOOK XXI.,"Of all the pow’rs of Heav’n, my mother most"
16652,BOOK XXI.,"Hath wrong’d me, who hath buoy’d me up with hope"
16653,BOOK XXI.,"Delusive, that, before the walls of Troy,"
16654,BOOK XXI.,I should by Phoebus’ swift-wing’d arrows fall.
16655,BOOK XXI.,"Would that by Hector’s hand ’twere mine to die,"
16656,BOOK XXI.,The bravest of their brave! a warrior so
16657,BOOK XXI.,Were by a warrior slain! now am I doom’d
16658,BOOK XXI.,"Ignobly here to sink, the mighty flood"
16659,BOOK XXI.,"O’erwhelming me, like some poor shepherd lad,"
16660,BOOK XXI.,Borne down in crossing by a wintry brook.”
16661,BOOK XXI.,
16662,BOOK XXI.,"He said; and quickly, cloth’d in mortal form,"
16663,BOOK XXI.,Neptune and Pallas at his side appear’d;
16664,BOOK XXI.,"With cheering words they took him by the hand,"
16665,BOOK XXI.,And thus th’ Earth-shaking God his speech began:
16666,BOOK XXI.,
16667,BOOK XXI.,"“Achilles, fear not thou, nor be dismay’d;"
16668,BOOK XXI.,"Such pow’rful aid, by Jove’s consent, we bring,"
16669,BOOK XXI.,"Pallas and I, from Heav’n; ’tis not decreed"
16670,BOOK XXI.,That thou shouldst by the River be o’erwhelm’d;
16671,BOOK XXI.,"He shall retire ere long, and thou shalt see;"
16672,BOOK XXI.,"And more, if thou wilt hear, we undertake"
16673,BOOK XXI.,"That from the war thine arm shall not be stay’d,"
16674,BOOK XXI.,Till thou shalt drive beneath the walls of Troy
16675,BOOK XXI.,The crowd of flying Trojans; thou thyself
16676,BOOK XXI.,"Shalt Hector slay, and safe regain the ships:"
16677,BOOK XXI.,Such high renown we give thee to achieve.”
16678,BOOK XXI.,
16679,BOOK XXI.,"They to the other Gods, this said, return’d;"
16680,BOOK XXI.,"He, greatly strengthen’d by the voice divine,"
16681,BOOK XXI.,Press’d onwards to the plain; the plain he found
16682,BOOK XXI.,"All flooded o’er; and, floating, armour fair,"
16683,BOOK XXI.,And many a corpse of men in battle slain;
16684,BOOK XXI.,"Yet onward, lifting high his feet, he press’d"
16685,BOOK XXI.,Right tow’rd the stream; nor could the mighty stream
16686,BOOK XXI.,"Check his advance, such vigour Pallas gave;"
16687,BOOK XXI.,"Nor did Scamander yet his fury stay,"
16688,BOOK XXI.,But fiercer rose his rage; and rearing high
16689,BOOK XXI.,"His crested wave, to Simois thus he cried:"
16690,BOOK XXI.,
16691,BOOK XXI.,"“Dear brother, aid me with united force"
16692,BOOK XXI.,"This mortal’s course to check; he, unrestrain’d,"
16693,BOOK XXI.,"Will royal Priam’s city soon destroy,"
16694,BOOK XXI.,Nor will the Trojans his assault endure.
16695,BOOK XXI.,"Haste to the rescue then, and from their source"
16696,BOOK XXI.,"Fill all thy stream, and all thy channels swell;"
16697,BOOK XXI.,"Rouse thy big waves, and roll a torrent down"
16698,BOOK XXI.,"Of logs and stones, to whelm this man of might,"
16699,BOOK XXI.,"Who triumphs now, and bears him as a God."
16700,BOOK XXI.,"Nought shall his strength or beauty then avail,"
16701,BOOK XXI.,"Or gallant arms, beneath the waters sunk,"
16702,BOOK XXI.,Deep buried in the mud: himself will I
16703,BOOK XXI.,"In sand imbed, and o’er his corpse a pile"
16704,BOOK XXI.,Of shingly gravel heap; nor shall the Greeks
16705,BOOK XXI.,"Be able to collect his bones, encas’d"
16706,BOOK XXI.,By me so deep in slime. His monument
16707,BOOK XXI.,They here may raise; but when they celebrate
16708,BOOK XXI.,"His fun’ral rites, no mound will he require.”"
16709,BOOK XXI.,
16710,BOOK XXI.,"He said; and on Achilles, from on high"
16711,BOOK XXI.,"Came boiling, rushing down, with thund’ring roar,"
16712,BOOK XXI.,With foam and blood and corpses intermix’d.
16713,BOOK XXI.,"High rose the Heav’n-born River’s darkling wave,"
16714,BOOK XXI.,And bore Achilles downward; then in fear
16715,BOOK XXI.,Lest the broad waters of the eddying stream
16716,BOOK XXI.,"Should quite o’erwhelm him, Juno cried aloud,"
16717,BOOK XXI.,"And Vulcan thus, her son, in haste address’d:"
16718,BOOK XXI.,
16719,BOOK XXI.,"“Up, Vulcan; up, my son; for we had deem’d"
16720,BOOK XXI.,That eddying Xanthus stood to thee oppos’d:
16721,BOOK XXI.,Haste thee to aid; thy fiery strength display;
16722,BOOK XXI.,While from the sea I call the stormy blast
16723,BOOK XXI.,"Of Zephyr and brisk Notus, who shall drive"
16724,BOOK XXI.,"The raging flames ahead, and burn alike"
16725,BOOK XXI.,The Trojans and their arms: do thou the while
16726,BOOK XXI.,Burn down the trees on Xanthus’ banks; himself
16727,BOOK XXI.,"Assail with fire, nor by his honey’d words"
16728,BOOK XXI.,Nor by his menaces be turn’d aside;
16729,BOOK XXI.,"Nor, till thou hear my voice, restrain thy pow’r;"
16730,BOOK XXI.,Then stay the raging flames’ unwearied course.”
16731,BOOK XXI.,
16732,BOOK XXI.,Thus Juno spoke; and Vulcan straight prepar’d
16733,BOOK XXI.,The heav’nly fire; and first upon the plain
16734,BOOK XXI.,"The flames he kindled, and the dead consum’d,"
16735,BOOK XXI.,"Who lay, promiscuous, by Achilles slain:"
16736,BOOK XXI.,"The plain was dried, and stay’d the wat’ry flood."
16737,BOOK XXI.,As when the breath of Boreas quickly dries
16738,BOOK XXI.,"In Autumn-time a newly-water’d field,"
16739,BOOK XXI.,The tiller’s heart rejoicing: so was dried
16740,BOOK XXI.,"The spacious plain; then he, the dead consum’d,"
16741,BOOK XXI.,Against the river turn’d the fiery glare:
16742,BOOK XXI.,"Burnt were the willows, elms, and tamarisk shrubs,"
16743,BOOK XXI.,"The lotus, and the reeds, and galingal,"
16744,BOOK XXI.,Which by the lovely river grew profuse.
16745,BOOK XXI.,"The eels and fishes, ’mid the eddying whirl,"
16746,BOOK XXI.,"’Mid the clear wave were hurrying here and there,"
16747,BOOK XXI.,In dire distress from Vulcan’s fiery breath:
16748,BOOK XXI.,"Scorch’d by the flames, the mighty River spoke:"
16749,BOOK XXI.,
16750,BOOK XXI.,"“Vulcan, no God against thy pow’r can stand,"
16751,BOOK XXI.,Nor with thy fiery flames will I contend;
16752,BOOK XXI.,Restrain thy wrath; though Peleus’ godlike son
16753,BOOK XXI.,"Should from their city drive the Trojans straight,"
16754,BOOK XXI.,With rival parties what concern have I?”
16755,BOOK XXI.,
16756,BOOK XXI.,"All scorch’d he spoke; his fair stream bubbling up,"
16757,BOOK XXI.,"As when a caldron on a blazing fire,"
16758,BOOK XXI.,"Fill’d with the melting fat of well-fed swine,"
16759,BOOK XXI.,"Boils up within, and bubbles all around,"
16760,BOOK XXI.,"With well-dried wood beneath, so bubbling up"
16761,BOOK XXI.,The waters of the lovely River boil’d:
16762,BOOK XXI.,"Nor onward would he flow, but check’d his course,"
16763,BOOK XXI.,"By the hot blast o’er-borne, and fiery strength"
16764,BOOK XXI.,"Of skilful Vulcan; and to Juno thus,"
16765,BOOK XXI.,"Imploring, he his winged words address’d:"
16766,BOOK XXI.,
16767,BOOK XXI.,"“Juno, what cause impels thy son, my stream,"
16768,BOOK XXI.,"O’er all the rest, to visit with his wrath?"
16769,BOOK XXI.,"E’en less than others who the Trojans aid,"
16770,BOOK XXI.,Have I offended; yet at thy command
16771,BOOK XXI.,Will I withdraw; but bid that he too cease;
16772,BOOK XXI.,"And this I swear, no Trojan more to save,"
16773,BOOK XXI.,"Though to devouring flames a prey, all Troy"
16774,BOOK XXI.,"Were blazing, kindled by the valiant Greeks.”"
16775,BOOK XXI.,
16776,BOOK XXI.,"This when the white-arm’d Goddess Juno heard,"
16777,BOOK XXI.,To Vulcan straight she thus address’d her speech:
16778,BOOK XXI.,"“Vulcan, my glorious son, restrain thy hand:"
16779,BOOK XXI.,"In mortal men’s behalf, it is not meet"
16780,BOOK XXI.,To press thus hardly an Immortal God.”
16781,BOOK XXI.,
16782,BOOK XXI.,"She said, and Vulcan stay’d his fiery strength,"
16783,BOOK XXI.,"And, back returning, in his wonted bed"
16784,BOOK XXI.,"Flow’d the fair River. Xanthus thus subdued,"
16785,BOOK XXI.,"These two their warfare ceas’d, by Juno check’d,"
16786,BOOK XXI.,Despite her wrath; but ’mid the other Gods
16787,BOOK XXI.,"Arose contention fierce, and discord dire,"
16788,BOOK XXI.,Their warring passions rous’d on either side.
16789,BOOK XXI.,With fearful crash they met: the broad Earth groan’d;
16790,BOOK XXI.,Loud rang the Heav’n as with a trumpet’s sound:
16791,BOOK XXI.,"Jove, on Olympus’ height, the tumult heard,"
16792,BOOK XXI.,"And in his heart he laugh’d a joyous laugh,"
16793,BOOK XXI.,To see the Gods in angry battle met.
16794,BOOK XXI.,"Not long they stood aloof, led on by Mars"
16795,BOOK XXI.,"The buckler-breaker, who to Pallas first,"
16796,BOOK XXI.,"Poising his spear, his bitter speech address’d:"
16797,BOOK XXI.,
16798,BOOK XXI.,"“What dost thou here, thou saucy jade, to war"
16799,BOOK XXI.,"The Gods exciting, overbold of mood,"
16800,BOOK XXI.,Led by thy haughty spirit? dost thou forget
16801,BOOK XXI.,"How thou the son of Tydeus, Diomed,"
16802,BOOK XXI.,"Didst urge against me, and with visible spear"
16803,BOOK XXI.,"Direct his aim, and aid to wound my flesh?"
16804,BOOK XXI.,"For all I suffer’d then, thou now shalt pay.”"
16805,BOOK XXI.,
16806,BOOK XXI.,"Thus as he spoke, he struck the tassell’d shield,"
16807,BOOK XXI.,"Awful to view, which not the lightning bolt"
16808,BOOK XXI.,Of Jove himself could pierce: the blood-stain’d Mars
16809,BOOK XXI.,Against it thrust in vain his pond’rous spear.
16810,BOOK XXI.,"The Goddess stoop’d, and in her ample hand"
16811,BOOK XXI.,"Took up a stone, that lay upon the plain,"
16812,BOOK XXI.,"Dark, rugged, vast, which men of elder days"
16813,BOOK XXI.,Had set to mark the limits of their land.
16814,BOOK XXI.,"Full on the neck of Mars she hurl’d the mass,"
16815,BOOK XXI.,His limbs relaxing: o’er sev’n hundred feet
16816,BOOK XXI.,"Prostrate he lay, his hair defil’d with dust:"
16817,BOOK XXI.,Loud rang his armour; and with scornful smile
16818,BOOK XXI.,Pallas address’d him thus with vaunting speech:
16819,BOOK XXI.,
16820,BOOK XXI.,"“Fool, hast thou yet to learn how mightier far"
16821,BOOK XXI.,"My strength than thine, that me thou dar’st to meet?"
16822,BOOK XXI.,"Bear thus the burthen of thy mother’s curse,"
16823,BOOK XXI.,"Who works thee harm, in wrath that thou the Greeks"
16824,BOOK XXI.,"Deserting, aid’st the haughty Trojans’ cause.”"
16825,BOOK XXI.,
16826,BOOK XXI.,"She said, and turn’d away her piercing glance:"
16827,BOOK XXI.,"Him, deeply groaning, scarce to life restor’d,"
16828,BOOK XXI.,"Jove’s daughter Venus taking by the hand,"
16829,BOOK XXI.,Led from the field; which when the white-arm’d Queen
16830,BOOK XXI.,"Beheld, in haste to Pallas thus she cried:"
16831,BOOK XXI.,"“O Heav’n, brave child of aegis-bearing Jove,"
16832,BOOK XXI.,Undaunted! lo again this saucy jade
16833,BOOK XXI.,"Amid the press, the bane of mortals, Mars"
16834,BOOK XXI.,Leads from the field; but haste thee in pursuit.”
16835,BOOK XXI.,
16836,BOOK XXI.,Thus Juno: Pallas hasten’d in pursuit
16837,BOOK XXI.,Well pleas’d; and Venus with her pow’rful hand
16838,BOOK XXI.,"Assailing, struck upon the breast; at once"
16839,BOOK XXI.,The Goddess’ courage and her limbs gave way.
16840,BOOK XXI.,"There on the ground the two together lay,"
16841,BOOK XXI.,While Pallas o’er them thus with vaunting speech:
16842,BOOK XXI.,
16843,BOOK XXI.,"“Would all were such, who aid the Trojan cause,"
16844,BOOK XXI.,"Whene’er they meet in fight the warlike Greeks,"
16845,BOOK XXI.,"As valiant and as stout as Venus proves,"
16846,BOOK XXI.,"Who brings her aid to Mars, confronting me;"
16847,BOOK XXI.,"Then had our warlike labours long been o’er,"
16848,BOOK XXI.,And Ilium’s strong-built citadel overthrown.”
16849,BOOK XXI.,
16850,BOOK XXI.,"Thus Pallas spoke: the white-arm’d Goddess smil’d,"
16851,BOOK XXI.,And to Apollo thus th’ Earth-shaker spoke:
16852,BOOK XXI.,
16853,BOOK XXI.,"“Phoebus, why stand we idly thus aloof?"
16854,BOOK XXI.,"The war begun by others, ’tis not meet;"
16855,BOOK XXI.,"And shame it were, that to Olympus’ height"
16856,BOOK XXI.,And to the brazen-floor’d abode of Jove
16857,BOOK XXI.,We two without a contest should return.
16858,BOOK XXI.,"Thou then begin, as younger: ’twere not well"
16859,BOOK XXI.,"For me, in age and practice more advanc’d."
16860,BOOK XXI.,"Feeble of soul, how senseless is thy heart!"
16861,BOOK XXI.,Hast thou forgotten all the cruel wrongs
16862,BOOK XXI.,"We two, alone of all th’ Immortals, bore,"
16863,BOOK XXI.,"When here, in Ilium, for a year, we serv’d,"
16864,BOOK XXI.,"By Jove’s command, the proud Laomedon,"
16865,BOOK XXI.,For promis’d hire; and he our tasks assign’d?
16866,BOOK XXI.,"His fortress, and a wall both broad and fair"
16867,BOOK XXI.,"I built, the town’s impregnable defence;"
16868,BOOK XXI.,"While thou didst on his plodding herds attend,"
16869,BOOK XXI.,In many-crested Ida’s woody glens.
16870,BOOK XXI.,"But when the joyous seasons, in their course,"
16871,BOOK XXI.,"Had brought our labour’s term, the haughty King"
16872,BOOK XXI.,"Denied our guerdon, and with threats dismiss’d."
16873,BOOK XXI.,"Bound hand and foot, he threaten’d thee to send"
16874,BOOK XXI.,"And sell to slav’ry in the distant isles,"
16875,BOOK XXI.,And with the sword cut off the ears of both.
16876,BOOK XXI.,"So in indignant sorrow we return’d,"
16877,BOOK XXI.,"Robb’d of the hire he promis’d, but denied."
16878,BOOK XXI.,For this thy favour dost thou show to Troy;
16879,BOOK XXI.,"And dost not rather join thy force to ours,"
16880,BOOK XXI.,That down upon their knees the Trojans all
16881,BOOK XXI.,"Should perish, with their babes and matrons chaste.”"
16882,BOOK XXI.,
16883,BOOK XXI.,Whom answer’d thus the far-destroying King:
16884,BOOK XXI.,"“Earth-shaking God, I should not gain with thee"
16885,BOOK XXI.,"The esteem of wise, if I with thee should fight"
16886,BOOK XXI.,"For mortal men; poor wretches, who like leaves"
16887,BOOK XXI.,"Flourish awhile, and eat the fruits of earth,"
16888,BOOK XXI.,"But, sapless, soon decay: from combat then"
16889,BOOK XXI.,"Refrain we, and to others leave the strife.”"
16890,BOOK XXI.,
16891,BOOK XXI.,"He turn’d, thus saying: for he deem’d it shame"
16892,BOOK XXI.,His father’s brother to assail in arms;
16893,BOOK XXI.,"But him his sister, Goddess of the chase,"
16894,BOOK XXI.,"Rebuk’d, and thus with scornful speech address’d:"
16895,BOOK XXI.,
16896,BOOK XXI.,"“Fliest thou, Apollo? and to Neptune leav’st"
16897,BOOK XXI.,The easy victory and baseless fame?
16898,BOOK XXI.,Why o’er thy shoulder hangs thine idle bow?
16899,BOOK XXI.,"Ne’er in our father’s halls again, as erst"
16900,BOOK XXI.,"Among th’ Immortals, let me hear thee boast"
16901,BOOK XXI.,How thou with Neptune wouldst in arms contend.”
16902,BOOK XXI.,
16903,BOOK XXI.,Thus she; Apollo answer’d not a word;
16904,BOOK XXI.,"But Jove’s imperial consort, fill’d with wrath,"
16905,BOOK XXI.,Assail’d with bitter words the Archer-Queen.
16906,BOOK XXI.,
16907,BOOK XXI.,"“How canst thou dare, thou saucy minx, to stand[7]"
16908,BOOK XXI.,"Oppos’d to me, too great for thine assault,"
16909,BOOK XXI.,Despite thy bow? though Jove hath giv’n thee pow’r
16910,BOOK XXI.,"O’er feeble women, whom thou wilt, to slay,"
16911,BOOK XXI.,E’en as a lion; better were’t for thee
16912,BOOK XXI.,"To chase the mountain beasts and flying hinds,"
16913,BOOK XXI.,"Than thy superiors thus to meet in arms,"
16914,BOOK XXI.,"But since thou dar’st confront me, thou shalt know"
16915,BOOK XXI.,And feel how far my might surpasses thine.”
16916,BOOK XXI.,
16917,BOOK XXI.,She said; and with the left hand both the wrists
16918,BOOK XXI.,"Of Dian grasping, with her ample right"
16919,BOOK XXI.,The bow and quiver from her shoulders tore;
16920,BOOK XXI.,"And with them, as she turn’d away her head,"
16921,BOOK XXI.,With scornful laughter buffeted her ears:
16922,BOOK XXI.,The arrows keen were scatter’d on the ground:
16923,BOOK XXI.,"Weeping, the Goddess fled; as flies a dove"
16924,BOOK XXI.,"The hawk’s pursuit, and in a hollow rock"
16925,BOOK XXI.,"Finds refuge, doom’d not yet to fall a prey;"
16926,BOOK XXI.,"So, weeping, Dian fled, and left her bow."
16927,BOOK XXI.,
16928,BOOK XXI.,Them Hermes to Latona thus: “With thee
16929,BOOK XXI.,I strive not; shame it were to meet in fight
16930,BOOK XXI.,A consort of the cloud-compelling Jove.
16931,BOOK XXI.,"Freely amid th’ Immortals make thy boast,"
16932,BOOK XXI.,That by thy prowess thou hast vanquish’d me.”
16933,BOOK XXI.,
16934,BOOK XXI.,"Thus he: Latona gather’d up the bow,"
16935,BOOK XXI.,"And fallen arrows, scatter’d here and there"
16936,BOOK XXI.,"Amid the whirling dust; then, these regain’d,"
16937,BOOK XXI.,"Following her daughter, from the field withdrew."
16938,BOOK XXI.,"Meanwhile to high Olympus fled the Maid,"
16939,BOOK XXI.,And to the brazen-floor’d abode of Jove.
16940,BOOK XXI.,"There, weeping, on her father’s knees she sat,"
16941,BOOK XXI.,While quiver’d round her form th’ ambrosial robe.
16942,BOOK XXI.,"The son of Saturn tow’rds him drew his child,"
16943,BOOK XXI.,"And thus, with gracious smile, enquiry made:"
16944,BOOK XXI.,“Which of the heav’nly pow’rs hath wrong’d thee thus
16945,BOOK XXI.,"My child, as guilty of some open shame?”"
16946,BOOK XXI.,
16947,BOOK XXI.,To whom the bright-crown’d Goddess of the chase:
16948,BOOK XXI.,"“Thy wife, my father, white-arm’d Juno; she"
16949,BOOK XXI.,"Hath dealt thus rudely with me; she, from whom"
16950,BOOK XXI.,All jars and strife among the Gods proceed.”
16951,BOOK XXI.,
16952,BOOK XXI.,"Such converse while they held, the gates of Troy"
16953,BOOK XXI.,"Apollo enter’d, for the well-built wall"
16954,BOOK XXI.,"Alarm’d, lest e’en against the will of fate"
16955,BOOK XXI.,The Greeks that day should raze it to the ground.
16956,BOOK XXI.,"The other Gods were to Olympus gone,"
16957,BOOK XXI.,"Triumphant these, and those in angry mood,"
16958,BOOK XXI.,And took their seats before the cloud-girt Sire.
16959,BOOK XXI.,"But on the Trojans pressing, Peleus’ son"
16960,BOOK XXI.,"Horses and men alike, promiscuous, slew."
16961,BOOK XXI.,"As in a city, which the Gods in wrath"
16962,BOOK XXI.,"Have fir’d, whose volleying smoke ascends to Heav’n,"
16963,BOOK XXI.,"On all her people grievous toil is cast,"
16964,BOOK XXI.,"On many, harm and loss; such toil, such loss"
16965,BOOK XXI.,Achilles wrought amid the Trojan host.
16966,BOOK XXI.,
16967,BOOK XXI.,"Upon a lofty tow’r, the work of Gods,"
16968,BOOK XXI.,"The aged Priam stood, and thence beheld"
16969,BOOK XXI.,"By fierce Achilles driven in flight confused,"
16970,BOOK XXI.,"Their courage quite subdued, the Trojan host:"
16971,BOOK XXI.,"Then, groaning, from the tow’r he hasten’d down,"
16972,BOOK XXI.,And to the warders cried along the wall:
16973,BOOK XXI.,
16974,BOOK XXI.,"“Stand to the gates, and hold them open’d wide,"
16975,BOOK XXI.,"That in the crowd of fugitives may pour,"
16976,BOOK XXI.,And refuge find; for close upon their flight
16977,BOOK XXI.,Achilles hangs; disaster now is near.
16978,BOOK XXI.,"But while our friends, receiv’d within the walls,"
16979,BOOK XXI.,"Find time to breathe again, replace in haste"
16980,BOOK XXI.,The closely-fitting portals; for I fear
16981,BOOK XXI.,That man of blood may e’en the city storm.”
16982,BOOK XXI.,
16983,BOOK XXI.,"He said; the gates they open’d, and drew back"
16984,BOOK XXI.,"The solid bars; the portals, op’ning wide,"
16985,BOOK XXI.,Let in the light; but in the vacant space
16986,BOOK XXI.,"Apollo stood, the Trojan host to save."
16987,BOOK XXI.,"The flyers, parch’d with thirst and dust-begrim’d,"
16988,BOOK XXI.,Straight for the city and the lofty wall
16989,BOOK XXI.,"Made from the plain; Achilles, spear in hand,"
16990,BOOK XXI.,Press’d hotly on the rearmost; for his soul
16991,BOOK XXI.,"With rage was fill’d, and madd’ning lust of fame."
16992,BOOK XXI.,And now the lofty-gated city of Troy
16993,BOOK XXI.,The sons of Greece had won; but Phoebus rous’d
16994,BOOK XXI.,"Agenor’s spirit, a valiant youth and strong,"
16995,BOOK XXI.,Son of Antenor; he his bosom fill’d
16996,BOOK XXI.,"With dauntless courage, and beside him stood"
16997,BOOK XXI.,"To turn aside the heavy hand of death,"
16998,BOOK XXI.,"As, veil’d in cloud, against the oak he lean’d."
16999,BOOK XXI.,"He, when Achilles’ awful form he knew,"
17000,BOOK XXI.,"Yet firmly stood, though much perplex’d in mind,"
17001,BOOK XXI.,As thus he commun’d with his mighty heart:
17002,BOOK XXI.,
17003,BOOK XXI.,“Oh woe is me! should I attempt to fly
17004,BOOK XXI.,"Before Achilles’ might, where fly the rest"
17005,BOOK XXI.,"Across the plain, disorder’d, he would soon"
17006,BOOK XXI.,"O’ertake me, and in flight ignoble slay."
17007,BOOK XXI.,"Or should I leave the others to their fate,"
17008,BOOK XXI.,Scatter’d by Peleus’ son; and from the wall
17009,BOOK XXI.,"And o’er the plain of Troy direct my flight,"
17010,BOOK XXI.,"Far as the foot of Ida’s hill, and there"
17011,BOOK XXI.,"Lie hid in thickest covert; and at eve,"
17012,BOOK XXI.,"Refresh’d by bathing in the cooling stream,"
17013,BOOK XXI.,"And purg’d the sweat, retrace my steps to Troy?"
17014,BOOK XXI.,"Yet why, my soul, admit such thoughts as these?"
17015,BOOK XXI.,"For should he mark me flying from the town,"
17016,BOOK XXI.,"And overtake me by his speed of foot,"
17017,BOOK XXI.,No hope were left me of escape from death.
17018,BOOK XXI.,So far his strength exceeds the strength of man.
17019,BOOK XXI.,But how if boldly I await him here
17020,BOOK XXI.,Before the wall? his flesh is not to wounds
17021,BOOK XXI.,"Impervious: but a single life is his,"
17022,BOOK XXI.,"Nor is he more, they say, than mortal man,"
17023,BOOK XXI.,"Though Jove assists him, and his triumph wills.”"
17024,BOOK XXI.,
17025,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and stood collected, to await"
17026,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles’ onset; and his manly heart,"
17027,BOOK XXI.,"With courage fill’d, was eager for the fray."
17028,BOOK XXI.,As when a panther from the thicket’s depth
17029,BOOK XXI.,"Comes forth to meet the hunter, undismay’d,"
17030,BOOK XXI.,Nor turn’d to flight by baying of the hounds;
17031,BOOK XXI.,"Nor, wounded or by jav’lin or by sword,"
17032,BOOK XXI.,"Or by the spear transfix’d, remits her rage,"
17033,BOOK XXI.,"But fights, until she reach her foe, or die;"
17034,BOOK XXI.,"Agenor so, Antenor’s godlike son,"
17035,BOOK XXI.,"Disdain’d to fly, ere prove Achilles’ might."
17036,BOOK XXI.,"Before his breast his shield’s broad orb he bore,"
17037,BOOK XXI.,"And pois’d his spear, as thus he call’d aloud:"
17038,BOOK XXI.,
17039,BOOK XXI.,"“Thy hope, renown’d Achilles, was this day"
17040,BOOK XXI.,The valiant Trojans’ city to destroy;
17041,BOOK XXI.,"Unconscious of the toils, the woes, that ye"
17042,BOOK XXI.,Around her walls await ye! for within
17043,BOOK XXI.,"Are warriors brave and num’rous, who will fight"
17044,BOOK XXI.,"In her defence, for parents, children, wives."
17045,BOOK XXI.,"Thou too, Achilles, here shalt meet thy doom,"
17046,BOOK XXI.,"All-pow’rful as thou art, and warrior bold.”"
17047,BOOK XXI.,
17048,BOOK XXI.,"He said, and threw with stalwart hand the spear;"
17049,BOOK XXI.,"Achilles’ leg he struck, below the knee,"
17050,BOOK XXI.,Nor miss’d his aim; and loudly rang the greaves
17051,BOOK XXI.,Of new-wrought tin; but back the brazen point
17052,BOOK XXI.,"Rebounded, nor the heav’nly armour pierc’d."
17053,BOOK XXI.,In turn Achilles on Agenor sprang:
17054,BOOK XXI.,"But Phoebus robb’d him of his hop’d-for prize,"
17055,BOOK XXI.,"Who, veil’d in thickest cloud, convey’d away"
17056,BOOK XXI.,"Antenor’s son, and from the battle bore"
17057,BOOK XXI.,To rest in peace; while he by guile withdrew
17058,BOOK XXI.,The son of Peleus from the flying crowd:
17059,BOOK XXI.,"For in Agenor’s very likeness clad,"
17060,BOOK XXI.,Before him stood the far-destroying King:
17061,BOOK XXI.,"Then fled, Achilles hast’ning in pursuit."
17062,BOOK XXI.,He o’er the fertile plain with flying foot
17063,BOOK XXI.,Pursu’d; beside Scamander’s eddying stream
17064,BOOK XXI.,"Apollo turn’d, and still but little space"
17065,BOOK XXI.,"Before him flying, subtly lur’d him on,"
17066,BOOK XXI.,Each moment hoping to attain his prize.
17067,BOOK XXI.,"Meantime the gen’ral crowd, in panic flight,"
17068,BOOK XXI.,"With eager haste the city’s refuge sought,"
17069,BOOK XXI.,And all the town with fugitives was fill’d.
17070,BOOK XXI.,Nor did they dare without the walls to stand
17071,BOOK XXI.,For mutual aid; nor halt to know what friends
17072,BOOK XXI.,"Were safe, who left upon the battle-field;"
17073,BOOK XXI.,But through the gates pour’d in the hurrying mass
17074,BOOK XXI.,Who to their active limbs their safety ow’d.

17138,BOOK XXII.,"Shines eminent amid the depth of night,"
17139,BOOK XXII.,Whom men the dog-star of Orion call;
17140,BOOK XXII.,"The brightest he, but sign to mortal man"
17141,BOOK XXII.,"Of evil augury, and fiery heat:"
17142,BOOK XXII.,So shone the brass upon the warrior’s breast.
17143,BOOK XXII.,
17144,BOOK XXII.,"The old man groan’d aloud, and lifting high"
17145,BOOK XXII.,"His hands, he beat his head, and with loud voice"
17146,BOOK XXII.,"Call’d on his son, imploring; he, unmov’d,"
17147,BOOK XXII.,"Held post before the gates, awaiting there"
17148,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles’ fierce encounter; him his sire,"
17149,BOOK XXII.,"With hands outstretch’d and piteous tone, address’d:"
17150,BOOK XXII.,
17151,BOOK XXII.,"“Hector, my son, await not here alone"
17152,BOOK XXII.,"That warrior’s charge, lest thou to fate succumb,"
17153,BOOK XXII.,"Beneath Pelides’ arm, thy better far!"
17154,BOOK XXII.,Accurs’d be he! would that th’ immortal Gods
17155,BOOK XXII.,So favour’d him as I! then should his corpse
17156,BOOK XXII.,Soon to the vultures and the dogs be giv’n!
17157,BOOK XXII.,(So should my heart a load of anguish lose)
17158,BOOK XXII.,"By whom I am of many sons bereav’d,"
17159,BOOK XXII.,"Many and brave, whom he has slain, or sold"
17160,BOOK XXII.,"To distant isles in slav’ry; and e’en now,"
17161,BOOK XXII.,Within the city walls I look in vain
17162,BOOK XXII.,"For two, Lycaon brave, and Polydore,"
17163,BOOK XXII.,"My gallant sons, by fair Laothoe:"
17164,BOOK XXII.,"If haply yet they live, with brass and gold"
17165,BOOK XXII.,Their ransom shall be paid; good store of these
17166,BOOK XXII.,We can command; for with his daughter fair
17167,BOOK XXII.,A wealthy dowry aged Altes gave.
17168,BOOK XXII.,"But to the viewless shades should they have gone,"
17169,BOOK XXII.,Deep were their mother’s sorrow and my own;
17170,BOOK XXII.,"But of the gen’ral public, well I know"
17171,BOOK XXII.,"Far lighter were the grief, than if they heard"
17172,BOOK XXII.,That thou hadst fall’n beneath Achilles’ hand.
17173,BOOK XXII.,"Then enter now, my son, the city gates,"
17174,BOOK XXII.,"And of the women and the men of Troy,"
17175,BOOK XXII.,"Be still the guardian; nor to Peleus’ son,"
17176,BOOK XXII.,"With thine own life, immortal glory give."
17177,BOOK XXII.,"Look too on me with pity; me, on whom,"
17178,BOOK XXII.,"E’en on the threshold of mine age, hath Jove"
17179,BOOK XXII.,"A bitter burthen cast, condemn’d to see"
17180,BOOK XXII.,"My sons struck down, my daughters dragg’d away"
17181,BOOK XXII.,In servile bonds; our chambers’ sanctity
17182,BOOK XXII.,Invaded; and our babes by hostile hands
17183,BOOK XXII.,Dash’d to the ground; and by ferocious Greeks
17184,BOOK XXII.,Enslav’d the widows of my slaughter’d sons.
17185,BOOK XXII.,"On me at last the rav’ning dogs shall feed,"
17186,BOOK XXII.,"When by some foeman’s hand, by sword or lance,"
17187,BOOK XXII.,My soul shall from my body be divorc’d;
17188,BOOK XXII.,"Those very dogs which I myself have bred,"
17189,BOOK XXII.,"Fed at my table, guardians of my gate,"
17190,BOOK XXII.,"Shall lap my blood, and over-gorg’d shall lie"
17191,BOOK XXII.,E’en on my threshold. That a youth should fall
17192,BOOK XXII.,"Victim, to Mars, beneath a foeman’s spear,"
17193,BOOK XXII.,May well beseem his years; and if he fall
17194,BOOK XXII.,"With honour, though he die, yet glorious he!"
17195,BOOK XXII.,"But when the hoary head and hoary beard,"
17196,BOOK XXII.,"And naked corpse to rav’ning dogs are giv’n,"
17197,BOOK XXII.,No sadder sight can wretched mortals see.”
17198,BOOK XXII.,
17199,BOOK XXII.,"The old man spoke, and from, his head he tore"
17200,BOOK XXII.,The hoary hair; yet Hector firm remain’d.
17201,BOOK XXII.,"Then to the front his mother rush’d, in tears,"
17202,BOOK XXII.,"Her bosom bare, with either hand her breast"
17203,BOOK XXII.,"Sustaining, and with tears address’d him thus:"
17204,BOOK XXII.,"“Hector, my child, thy mother’s breast revere;"
17205,BOOK XXII.,And on this bosom if thine infant woes
17206,BOOK XXII.,"Have e’er been hush’d, bear now in mind, dear child,"
17207,BOOK XXII.,The debt thou ow’st; and from within the walls
17208,BOOK XXII.,"Ward off this fearful man, nor in the field"
17209,BOOK XXII.,"Encounter; curs’d be he! should he prevail,"
17210,BOOK XXII.,"And slay thee, not upon the fun’ral bed,"
17211,BOOK XXII.,"My child, my own, the offspring of my womb,"
17212,BOOK XXII.,"Shall I deplore thee, nor thy widow’d wife,"
17213,BOOK XXII.,"But far away, beside the Grecian ships,"
17214,BOOK XXII.,Thy corpse shall to the rav’ning dogs be giv’n.”
17215,BOOK XXII.,
17216,BOOK XXII.,"Thus they, with tears and earnest pray’rs imploring,"
17217,BOOK XXII.,"Address’d their son; yet Hector firm remain’d,"
17218,BOOK XXII.,Waiting th’ approach of Peleus’ godlike son.
17219,BOOK XXII.,"As when a snake upon the mountain side,"
17220,BOOK XXII.,"With deadly venom charg’d, beside his hole,"
17221,BOOK XXII.,"Awaits the traveller, and fill’d with rage,"
17222,BOOK XXII.,"Coil’d round his hole, his baleful glances darts;"
17223,BOOK XXII.,"So fill’d with dauntless courage Hector stood,"
17224,BOOK XXII.,"Scorning retreat, his gleaming buckler propp’d"
17225,BOOK XXII.,"Against the jutting tow’r; then, deeply mov’d,"
17226,BOOK XXII.,Thus with his warlike soul communion held:
17227,BOOK XXII.,
17228,BOOK XXII.,“Oh woe is me! if I should enter now
17229,BOOK XXII.,"The city gates, I should the just reproach"
17230,BOOK XXII.,"Encounter of Polydamas, who first"
17231,BOOK XXII.,His counsel gave within the walls to lead
17232,BOOK XXII.,"The Trojan forces, on that fatal night"
17233,BOOK XXII.,When great Achilles in the field appear’d.
17234,BOOK XXII.,I heeded not his counsel; would I had!
17235,BOOK XXII.,"Now, since my folly hath the people slain,"
17236,BOOK XXII.,"I well might blush to meet the Trojan men,"
17237,BOOK XXII.,"And long-rob’d dames of Troy, lest some might say,"
17238,BOOK XXII.,"To me inferior far, ‘This woful loss"
17239,BOOK XXII.,To Hector’s blind self-confidence we owe.’
17240,BOOK XXII.,"Thus shall they say; for me, ’twere better far,"
17241,BOOK XXII.,"Or from Achilles, slain in open fight,"
17242,BOOK XXII.,"Back to return in triumph, or myself"
17243,BOOK XXII.,To perish nobly in my country’s cause.
17244,BOOK XXII.,"What if my bossy shield I lay aside,"
17245,BOOK XXII.,"And stubborn helmet, and my pond’rous spear"
17246,BOOK XXII.,"Propping against the wall, go forth to meet"
17247,BOOK XXII.,Th’ unmatch’d Achilles? What if I engage
17248,BOOK XXII.,"That Helen’s self, and with her all the spoil,"
17249,BOOK XXII.,And all that Paris in his hollow ships
17250,BOOK XXII.,"Brought here to Troy, whence first this war arose,"
17251,BOOK XXII.,Should be restor’d; and to the Greeks be paid
17252,BOOK XXII.,"An ample tribute from the city’s stores,"
17253,BOOK XXII.,Her secret treasures; and hereafter bind
17254,BOOK XXII.,The Trojans by their Elders’ solemn oaths
17255,BOOK XXII.,"Nought to withhold, but fairly to divide"
17256,BOOK XXII.,Whate’er of wealth our much-loved city holds?
17257,BOOK XXII.,"But wherefore entertain such thoughts, my soul?"
17258,BOOK XXII.,"Should I so meet him, what if he should show"
17259,BOOK XXII.,"Nor pity nor remorse, but slay me there,"
17260,BOOK XXII.,"Defenceless as a woman, and unarm’d?"
17261,BOOK XXII.,"Not this the time, nor he the man, with whom"
17262,BOOK XXII.,"By forest oak or rock, like youth and maid,"
17263,BOOK XXII.,"To hold light talk, as youth and maid might hold."
17264,BOOK XXII.,"Better to dare the fight, and know at once"
17265,BOOK XXII.,To whom the vict’ry is decreed by Heav’n.”
17266,BOOK XXII.,
17267,BOOK XXII.,"Thus, as he stood, he mus’d; but near approach’d"
17268,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles, terrible as plumed Mars;"
17269,BOOK XXII.,From his right shoulder brandishing aloft
17270,BOOK XXII.,"The ashen spear of Peleus, while around"
17271,BOOK XXII.,"Flash’d his bright armour, dazzling as the glare"
17272,BOOK XXII.,"Of burning fire, or of the rising sun."
17273,BOOK XXII.,"Hector beheld, and trembled at the sight;"
17274,BOOK XXII.,"Nor dar’d he there await th’ attack, but left"
17275,BOOK XXII.,"The gates behind, and, terror-stricken, fled."
17276,BOOK XXII.,"Forward, with flying foot, Pelides rush’d."
17277,BOOK XXII.,"As when a falcon, bird of swiftest flight,"
17278,BOOK XXII.,"From some high mountain-top, on tim’rous dove"
17279,BOOK XXII.,"Swoops fiercely down; she, from beneath, in fear,"
17280,BOOK XXII.,"Evades the stroke; he, dashing through the brake,"
17281,BOOK XXII.,"Shrill-shrieking, pounces on his destin’d prey;"
17282,BOOK XXII.,"So, wing’d with desp’rate hate, Achilles flew,"
17283,BOOK XXII.,"So Hector, flying from his keen pursuit,"
17284,BOOK XXII.,Beneath the walls his active sinews plied.
17285,BOOK XXII.,"They by the watch-tow’r, and beneath the wall"
17286,BOOK XXII.,"Where stood the wind-beat fig-tree, rac’d amain"
17287,BOOK XXII.,"Along the public road, until they reach’d"
17288,BOOK XXII.,"The fairly-flowing fount whence issu’d forth,"
17289,BOOK XXII.,"From double source, Scamander’s eddying streams."
17290,BOOK XXII.,"One with hot current flows, and from beneath,"
17291,BOOK XXII.,"As from a furnace, clouds of steam arise;"
17292,BOOK XXII.,’Mid summer’s heat the other rises cold
17293,BOOK XXII.,"As hail, or snow, or water crystalliz’d;"
17294,BOOK XXII.,Beside the fountains stood the washing-troughs
17295,BOOK XXII.,"Of well-wrought stone, where erst the wives of Troy"
17296,BOOK XXII.,"And daughters fair their choicest garments wash’d,"
17297,BOOK XXII.,"In peaceful times, ere came the sons of Greece."
17298,BOOK XXII.,"There rac’d they, one in flight, and one pursuing;"
17299,BOOK XXII.,"Good he who fled, but better who pursu’d,"
17300,BOOK XXII.,With fiery speed; for on that race was stak’d
17301,BOOK XXII.,"No common victim, no ignoble ox:"
17302,BOOK XXII.,The prize at stake was mighty Hector’s life.
17303,BOOK XXII.,As when the solid-footed horses fly
17304,BOOK XXII.,"Around the course, contending for the prize,"
17305,BOOK XXII.,"Tripod, or woman of her lord bereft;"
17306,BOOK XXII.,So rac’d they thrice around the walls of Troy
17307,BOOK XXII.,With active feet; and all the Gods beheld.
17308,BOOK XXII.,Then thus began the Sire of Gods and men:
17309,BOOK XXII.,“A woful sight mine eyes behold; a man
17310,BOOK XXII.,I love in flight around the walls! my heart
17311,BOOK XXII.,"For Hector grieves, who, now upon the crown"
17312,BOOK XXII.,"Of deeply-furrow’d Ida, now again"
17313,BOOK XXII.,"On Ilium’s heights, with fat of choicest bulls"
17314,BOOK XXII.,"Hath pil’d mine altar; whom around the walls,"
17315,BOOK XXII.,With flying speed Achilles now pursues.
17316,BOOK XXII.,"Give me your counsel, Gods, and say, from death"
17317,BOOK XXII.,"If we shall rescue him, or must he die,"
17318,BOOK XXII.,"Brave as he is, beneath Pelides’ hand?”"
17319,BOOK XXII.,
17320,BOOK XXII.,"To whom the blue-ey’d Goddess, Pallas, thus:"
17321,BOOK XXII.,"“O Father, lightning-flashing, cloud-girt King,"
17322,BOOK XXII.,"What words are these? wouldst thou a mortal man,"
17323,BOOK XXII.,"Long doom’d by fate, again from death preserve?"
17324,BOOK XXII.,"Do as thou wilt, but not with our consent.”"
17325,BOOK XXII.,
17326,BOOK XXII.,To whom the Cloud-compeller thus replied:
17327,BOOK XXII.,"“Be of good cheer, my child! unwillingly"
17328,BOOK XXII.,"I speak, yet both thy wishes to oppose:"
17329,BOOK XXII.,"Have then thy will, and draw not back thy hand.”"
17330,BOOK XXII.,
17331,BOOK XXII.,"His words fresh impulse gave to Pallas’ zeal,"
17332,BOOK XXII.,And from Olympus’ heights in haste she sped.
17333,BOOK XXII.,
17334,BOOK XXII.,"Meanwhile on Hector, with untiring hate."
17335,BOOK XXII.,"The swift Achilles press’d: as when a hound,"
17336,BOOK XXII.,"Through glen and tangled brake, pursues a fawn,"
17337,BOOK XXII.,Rous’d from its lair upon the mountain side;
17338,BOOK XXII.,"And if awhile it should evade pursuit,"
17339,BOOK XXII.,"Low crouching in the copse, yet quests he back,"
17340,BOOK XXII.,"Searching unwearied, till he find the trace;"
17341,BOOK XXII.,"So Hector sought to baffle, but in vain,"
17342,BOOK XXII.,The keen pursuit of Peleus’ active son.
17343,BOOK XXII.,Oft as he sought the shelter of the gates
17344,BOOK XXII.,"Beneath the well-built tow’rs, if haply thence"
17345,BOOK XXII.,His comrades’ weapons might some aid afford;
17346,BOOK XXII.,"So oft his foeman, with superior speed,"
17347,BOOK XXII.,"Would cut him off, and turn him to the plain."
17348,BOOK XXII.,He tow’rd the city still essay’d his flight;
17349,BOOK XXII.,"And as in dreams, when one pursues in vain,"
17350,BOOK XXII.,"One seeks in vain to fly, the other seeks"
17351,BOOK XXII.,As vainly to pursue; so could not now
17352,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles reach, nor Hector quit, his foe."
17353,BOOK XXII.,Yet how should Hector now the doom of death
17354,BOOK XXII.,"Have ’scap’d, had not Apollo once again,"
17355,BOOK XXII.,"And for the last time, to his rescue come,"
17356,BOOK XXII.,And giv’n him strength and suppleness of limb?
17357,BOOK XXII.,
17358,BOOK XXII.,Then to the crowd Achilles with his head
17359,BOOK XXII.,Made sign that none at Hector should presume
17360,BOOK XXII.,"To cast a spear, lest one might wound, and so"
17361,BOOK XXII.,"The greater glory obtain, while he himself"
17362,BOOK XXII.,Must be contented with the second place.
17363,BOOK XXII.,But when the fourth time in their rapid course
17364,BOOK XXII.,"The founts were reach’d, th’ Eternal Father hung"
17365,BOOK XXII.,"His golden scales aloft, and plac’d in each"
17366,BOOK XXII.,"The lots of doom, for great Achilles one,"
17367,BOOK XXII.,"For Hector one, and held them by the midst:"
17368,BOOK XXII.,"Down sank the scale, weighted with Hector’s death,"
17369,BOOK XXII.,"Down to the shades, and Phoebus left his side."
17370,BOOK XXII.,
17371,BOOK XXII.,"Then to Pelides came the blue-ey’d Maid,"
17372,BOOK XXII.,"And stood beside him, and bespoke him thus:"
17373,BOOK XXII.,"“Achilles, lov’d of Heav’n, I trust that now"
17374,BOOK XXII.,To thee and me great glory shall accrue
17375,BOOK XXII.,"In Hector’s fall, insatiate of the fight."
17376,BOOK XXII.,"Escape he cannot now, though at the feet"
17377,BOOK XXII.,"Of aegis-bearing Jove, on his behalf,"
17378,BOOK XXII.,With earnest pray’r Apollo prostrate fall.
17379,BOOK XXII.,"But stay thou here and take thy breath, while I"
17380,BOOK XXII.,Persuade him to return and dare the fight.”
17381,BOOK XXII.,
17382,BOOK XXII.,"So Pallas spoke; and he with joy obeying,"
17383,BOOK XXII.,Stood leaning on his brass-barb’d ashen spear.
17384,BOOK XXII.,"The Goddess left him there, and went (the form"
17385,BOOK XXII.,And voice assuming of Deiphobus)
17386,BOOK XXII.,"In search of godlike Hector; him she found,"
17387,BOOK XXII.,"And standing near, with winged words address’d:"
17388,BOOK XXII.,
17389,BOOK XXII.,"“Sorely, good brother, hast thou been bested"
17390,BOOK XXII.,"By fierce Achilles, who around the walls"
17391,BOOK XXII.,Hath chas’d thee with swift foot; now stand we both
17392,BOOK XXII.,"For mutual succour, and his onset wait.”"
17393,BOOK XXII.,
17394,BOOK XXII.,To whom great Hector of the glancing helm:
17395,BOOK XXII.,"“Deiphobus, of all my brothers, sons"
17396,BOOK XXII.,"Of Hecuba and Priam, thou hast been"
17397,BOOK XXII.,Still dearest to my heart; and now the more
17398,BOOK XXII.,"I honour thee who dar’st on my behalf,"
17399,BOOK XXII.,"Seeing my peril, from within the walls"
17400,BOOK XXII.,"To sally forth, while others skulk behind.”"
17401,BOOK XXII.,
17402,BOOK XXII.,To whom the blue-ey’d Goddess thus replied:
17403,BOOK XXII.,"“With many pray’rs, good brother, both our sire"
17404,BOOK XXII.,"And honour’d mother, and our comrades all"
17405,BOOK XXII.,Successively implored me to remain;
17406,BOOK XXII.,Such fear is fall’n on all; but in my soul
17407,BOOK XXII.,On thine account too deep a grief I felt.
17408,BOOK XXII.,"Now, forward boldly! spare we not our spears;"
17409,BOOK XXII.,Make trial if Achilles to the ships
17410,BOOK XXII.,"From both of us our bloody spoils can bear,"
17411,BOOK XXII.,Or by thine arm himself may be subdued.”
17412,BOOK XXII.,
17413,BOOK XXII.,Thus Pallas lur’d him on with treach’rous wile;
17414,BOOK XXII.,"But when the two were met, and close at hand,"
17415,BOOK XXII.,First spoke great Hector of the glancing helm:
17416,BOOK XXII.,
17417,BOOK XXII.,"“No more before thee, Peleus’ son, I fly:"
17418,BOOK XXII.,"Thrice have I fled around the walls, nor dar’d"
17419,BOOK XXII.,Await thine onset; now my spirit is rous’d
17420,BOOK XXII.,"To stand before thee, to be slain, or slay."
17421,BOOK XXII.,But let us first th’ immortal Gods invoke;
17422,BOOK XXII.,The surest witnesses and guardians they
17423,BOOK XXII.,Of compacts: at my hand no foul disgrace
17424,BOOK XXII.,"Shalt thou sustain, if Jove with victory"
17425,BOOK XXII.,"Shall crown my firm endurance, and thy life"
17426,BOOK XXII.,To me be forfeit; of thine armour stripp’d
17427,BOOK XXII.,"I promise thee, Achilles, to the Greeks"
17428,BOOK XXII.,Thy body to restore; do thou the like.”
17429,BOOK XXII.,
17430,BOOK XXII.,With fierce regard Achilles answer’d thus:
17431,BOOK XXII.,"“Hector, thou object of my deadly hate,"
17432,BOOK XXII.,Talk not to me of compacts; as ’tween men
17433,BOOK XXII.,"And lions no firm concord can exist,"
17434,BOOK XXII.,"Nor wolves and lambs in harmony unite,"
17435,BOOK XXII.,But ceaseless enmity between them dwells:
17436,BOOK XXII.,"So not in friendly terms, nor compact firm,"
17437,BOOK XXII.,"Can thou and I unite, till one of us"
17438,BOOK XXII.,Glut with his blood the mail-clad warrior Mars.
17439,BOOK XXII.,Mind thee of all thy fence; behoves thee now
17440,BOOK XXII.,"To prove a spearman skill’d, and warrior brave."
17441,BOOK XXII.,"For thee escape is none; now, by my spear,"
17442,BOOK XXII.,"Hath Pallas doom’d thy death; my comrades’ blood,"
17443,BOOK XXII.,"Which thou hast shed, shall all be now aveng’d.”"
17444,BOOK XXII.,
17445,BOOK XXII.,"He said, and poising, hurl’d his weighty spear;"
17446,BOOK XXII.,"But Hector saw, and shunn’d the blow; he stoop’d,"
17447,BOOK XXII.,"And o’er his shoulder flew the brass-tipp’d spear,"
17448,BOOK XXII.,And in the ground was fix’d; but Pallas drew
17449,BOOK XXII.,"The weapon forth, and to Achilles’ hand,"
17450,BOOK XXII.,"All unobserv’d of Hector, gave it back."
17451,BOOK XXII.,Then Hector thus to Peleus’ matchless son:
17452,BOOK XXII.,
17453,BOOK XXII.,"“Thine aim has fail’d; nor truly has my fate,"
17454,BOOK XXII.,"Thou godlike son of Peleus, been to thee"
17455,BOOK XXII.,From Heav’n reveal’d; such was indeed thy boast;
17456,BOOK XXII.,"But flippant was thy speech, and subtly fram’d"
17457,BOOK XXII.,"To scare me with big words, and make me prove"
17458,BOOK XXII.,False to my wonted prowess and renown.
17459,BOOK XXII.,"Not in my back will I receive thy spear,"
17460,BOOK XXII.,"But through my breast, confronting thee, if Jove"
17461,BOOK XXII.,Have to thine arm indeed such triumph giv’n.
17462,BOOK XXII.,"Now, if thou canst, my spear in turn elude;"
17463,BOOK XXII.,May it be deeply buried in thy flesh!
17464,BOOK XXII.,"For lighter were to Troy the load of war,"
17465,BOOK XXII.,"If thou, the greatest of her foes, wert slain.”"
17466,BOOK XXII.,
17467,BOOK XXII.,"He said, and poising, hurl’d his pond’rous spear;"
17468,BOOK XXII.,Nor miss’d his aim; full in the midst he struck
17469,BOOK XXII.,Pelides’ shield; but glancing from the shield
17470,BOOK XXII.,"The weapon bounded off. Hector was griev’d,"
17471,BOOK XXII.,That thus his spear had bootless left his hand.
17472,BOOK XXII.,He stood aghast; no second spear was nigh:
17473,BOOK XXII.,And loudly on Deiphobus he call’d
17474,BOOK XXII.,A spear to bring; but he was far away.
17475,BOOK XXII.,"Then Hector knew that he was dup’d, and cried,"
17476,BOOK XXII.,“Oh Heav’n! the Gods above have doom’d my death!
17477,BOOK XXII.,I deem’d indeed that brave Deiphobus
17478,BOOK XXII.,Was near at hand; but he within the walls
17479,BOOK XXII.,"Is safe, and I by Pallas am betray’d."
17480,BOOK XXII.,"Now is my death at hand, nor far away:"
17481,BOOK XXII.,"Escape is none; since so hath Jove decreed,"
17482,BOOK XXII.,"And Jove’s far-darting son, who heretofore"
17483,BOOK XXII.,Have been my guards; my fate hath found me now.
17484,BOOK XXII.,"Yet not without a struggle let me die,"
17485,BOOK XXII.,"Nor all inglorious; but let some great act,"
17486,BOOK XXII.,"Which future days may hear of, mark my fall.”"
17487,BOOK XXII.,
17488,BOOK XXII.,"Thus as he spoke, his sharp-edged sword he drew,"
17489,BOOK XXII.,"Pond’rous and vast, suspended at his side;"
17490,BOOK XXII.,"Collected for the spring, and forward dash’d:"
17491,BOOK XXII.,"As when an eagle, bird of loftiest flight,"
17492,BOOK XXII.,"Through the dark clouds swoops downward on the plain,"
17493,BOOK XXII.,"To seize some tender lamb, or cow’ring hare;"
17494,BOOK XXII.,"So Hector rush’d, and wav’d his sharp-edg’d sword."
17495,BOOK XXII.,Achilles’ wrath was rous’d: with fury wild
17496,BOOK XXII.,His soul was fill’d: before his breast he bore
17497,BOOK XXII.,His well-wrought shield; and fiercely on his brow
17498,BOOK XXII.,"Nodded the four-plum’d helm, as on the breeze"
17499,BOOK XXII.,"Floated the golden hairs, with which the crest"
17500,BOOK XXII.,By Vulcan’s hand was thickly interlac’d;
17501,BOOK XXII.,"And as amid the stars’ unnumber’d host,"
17502,BOOK XXII.,"When twilight yields to night, one star appears,"
17503,BOOK XXII.,"Hesper, the brightest star that shines in Heav’n,"
17504,BOOK XXII.,"Gleam’d the sharp-pointed lance, which in his right"
17505,BOOK XXII.,"Achilles pois’d, on godlike Hector’s doom"
17506,BOOK XXII.,"Intent, and scanning eagerly to see"
17507,BOOK XXII.,Where from attack his body least was fenc’d.
17508,BOOK XXII.,"All else the glitt’ring armour guarded well,"
17509,BOOK XXII.,Which Hector from Patroclus’ corpse had stripp’d;
17510,BOOK XXII.,"One chink appear’d, just where the collar-bone"
17511,BOOK XXII.,"The neck and shoulder parts, beside the throat,"
17512,BOOK XXII.,Where lies expos’d the swiftest road of death.
17513,BOOK XXII.,"There levell’d he, as Hector onward rush’d;"
17514,BOOK XXII.,"Right through the yielding neck the lance was driv’n,"
17515,BOOK XXII.,"But sever’d not the windpipe, nor destroy’d"
17516,BOOK XXII.,His pow’r of speech; prone in the dust he fell;
17517,BOOK XXII.,"And o’er him, vaunting, thus Achilles spoke:"
17518,BOOK XXII.,
17519,BOOK XXII.,"“Hector, Patroclus stripping of his arms,"
17520,BOOK XXII.,"Thy hope was that thyself wast safe; and I,"
17521,BOOK XXII.,"Not present, brought no terror to thy soul:"
17522,BOOK XXII.,"Fool! in the hollow ships I yet remain’d,"
17523,BOOK XXII.,"I, his avenger, mightier far than he;"
17524,BOOK XXII.,"I, who am now thy conqu’ror. By the dogs"
17525,BOOK XXII.,"And vultures shall thy corpse be foully torn,"
17526,BOOK XXII.,While him the Greeks with fun’ral rites shall grace.”
17527,BOOK XXII.,
17528,BOOK XXII.,"Whom answer’d Hector of the glancing helm,"
17529,BOOK XXII.,"Prostrate and helpless: “By thy soul, thy knees,"
17530,BOOK XXII.,"Thy parents’ heads, Achilles, I beseech,"
17531,BOOK XXII.,Let not my corpse by Grecian dogs be torn.
17532,BOOK XXII.,"Accept the ample stores of brass and gold,"
17533,BOOK XXII.,Which as my ransom by my honour’d sire
17534,BOOK XXII.,And mother shall be paid thee; but my corpse
17535,BOOK XXII.,"Restore, that so the men and wives of Troy"
17536,BOOK XXII.,May deck with honours due my fun’ral pyre.”
17537,BOOK XXII.,
17538,BOOK XXII.,"To whom, with fierce aspect, Achilles thus:"
17539,BOOK XXII.,"“Knee me no knees, vile hound! nor prate to me"
17540,BOOK XXII.,"Of parents! such my hatred, that almost"
17541,BOOK XXII.,I could persuade myself to tear and eat
17542,BOOK XXII.,"Thy mangled flesh; such wrongs I have to avenge,"
17543,BOOK XXII.,"He lives not, who can save thee from the dogs;"
17544,BOOK XXII.,Not though with ransom ten and twenty fold
17545,BOOK XXII.,"He here should stand, and yet should promise more;"
17546,BOOK XXII.,"No, not though Priam’s royal self should sue"
17547,BOOK XXII.,To be allow’d for gold to ransom thee;
17548,BOOK XXII.,"No, not e’en so, thy mother shall obtain"
17549,BOOK XXII.,"To lay thee out upon the couch, and mourn"
17550,BOOK XXII.,"O’er thee, her offspring; but on all thy limbs"
17551,BOOK XXII.,Shall dogs and carrion vultures make their feast.”
17552,BOOK XXII.,
17553,BOOK XXII.,"To whom thus Hector of the glancing helm,"
17554,BOOK XXII.,Dying: “I know thee well; nor did I hope
17555,BOOK XXII.,To change thy purpose; iron is thy soul.
17556,BOOK XXII.,But see that on thy head I bring not down
17557,BOOK XXII.,"The wrath of Heav’n, when by the Scaean gate"
17558,BOOK XXII.,"The hand of Paris, with Apollo’s aid,"
17559,BOOK XXII.,"Brave warrior as thou art, shall strike thee down.”"
17560,BOOK XXII.,
17561,BOOK XXII.,"E’en as he spoke, his eyes were clos’d in death;"
17562,BOOK XXII.,"And to the viewless shades his spirit fled,"
17563,BOOK XXII.,"Mourning his fate, his youth and vigour lost."
17564,BOOK XXII.,
17565,BOOK XXII.,"To him, though dead, Achilles thus replied:"
17566,BOOK XXII.,"“Die thou! my fate I then shall meet, whene’er"
17567,BOOK XXII.,Jove and th’ immortal Gods shall so decree.”
17568,BOOK XXII.,
17569,BOOK XXII.,"He said, and from the corpse his spear withdrew,"
17570,BOOK XXII.,"And laid aside; then stripp’d the armour off,"
17571,BOOK XXII.,"With, blood besmear’d; the Greeks around him throng’d,"
17572,BOOK XXII.,"Gazing on Hector’s noble form and face,"
17573,BOOK XXII.,And none approach’d that did not add a wound:
17574,BOOK XXII.,"And one to other look’d, and said, “Good faith,"
17575,BOOK XXII.,"Hector is easier far to handle now,"
17576,BOOK XXII.,Then when erewhile he wrapp’d our ships in fire.”
17577,BOOK XXII.,"Thus would they say, then stab the dead anew."
17578,BOOK XXII.,
17579,BOOK XXII.,"But when the son of Peleus, swift of foot,"
17580,BOOK XXII.,"Had stripp’d the armour from the corpse, he rose,"
17581,BOOK XXII.,"And, standing, thus th’ assembled Greeks address’d:"
17582,BOOK XXII.,"“O friends, the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
17583,BOOK XXII.,"Since Heav’n hath granted us this man to slay,"
17584,BOOK XXII.,Whose single arm hath wrought us more of ill
17585,BOOK XXII.,"Than all the rest combin’d, advance we now"
17586,BOOK XXII.,"Before the city in arms, and trial make"
17587,BOOK XXII.,"What is the mind of Troy; if, Hector slain,"
17588,BOOK XXII.,"They from the citadel intend retreat,"
17589,BOOK XXII.,"Or still, despite their loss, their ground maintain."
17590,BOOK XXII.,"But wherefore entertain such thoughts, my soul?"
17591,BOOK XXII.,"Beside the ships, unwept, unburied, lies"
17592,BOOK XXII.,"Patroclus: whom I never can forget,"
17593,BOOK XXII.,"While number’d with the living, and my limbs"
17594,BOOK XXII.,Have pow’r to move; in Hades though the dead
17595,BOOK XXII.,"May be forgotten, yet e’en there will I"
17596,BOOK XXII.,The mem’ry of my lov’d companion keep.
17597,BOOK XXII.,"Now to the ships return we, sons of Greece,"
17598,BOOK XXII.,Glad paeans singing! with us he shall go;
17599,BOOK XXII.,"Great glory is ours, the godlike Hector slain,"
17600,BOOK XXII.,"The pride of Troy, and as a God rever’d.”"
17601,BOOK XXII.,
17602,BOOK XXII.,"He said, and foully Hector’s corpse misus’d;"
17603,BOOK XXII.,"Of either foot he pierc’d the tendon through,"
17604,BOOK XXII.,"That from the ancle passes to the heel,"
17605,BOOK XXII.,"And to his chariot bound with leathern thongs,"
17606,BOOK XXII.,Leaving the head to trail along the ground;
17607,BOOK XXII.,"Then mounted, with the captur’d arms, his car,"
17608,BOOK XXII.,"And urg’d his horses; nothing loth, they flew."
17609,BOOK XXII.,A cloud of dust the trailing body rais’d:
17610,BOOK XXII.,Loose hung his glossy hair; and in the dust
17611,BOOK XXII.,"Was laid that noble head, so graceful once;"
17612,BOOK XXII.,"Now to foul insult doom’d by Jove’s decree,"
17613,BOOK XXII.,"In his own country, by a foeman’s hand."
17614,BOOK XXII.,So lay the head of Hector; at the sight
17615,BOOK XXII.,"His aged mother tore her hair, and far"
17616,BOOK XXII.,"From off her head the glitt’ring veil she threw,"
17617,BOOK XXII.,And with loud cries her slaughter’d son bewail’d.
17618,BOOK XXII.,"Piteous, his father groan’d; and all around"
17619,BOOK XXII.,Was heard the voice of wailing and of woe.
17620,BOOK XXII.,"Such was the cry, as if the beetling height"
17621,BOOK XXII.,Of Ilium all were smould’ring in the fire.
17622,BOOK XXII.,Scarce in his anguish could the crowd restrain
17623,BOOK XXII.,The old man from issuing through the Dardan gates;
17624,BOOK XXII.,"Low in the dust he roll’d, imploring all,"
17625,BOOK XXII.,Entreating by his name each sev’ral man:
17626,BOOK XXII.,"“Forbear, my friends; though sorrowing, stay me not;"
17627,BOOK XXII.,"Leave me to reach alone the Grecian ships,"
17628,BOOK XXII.,"And there implore this man of violence,"
17629,BOOK XXII.,"This haughty chief, if haply he my years"
17630,BOOK XXII.,"May rev’rence, and have pity on my age."
17631,BOOK XXII.,"For he too has a father, like to me;"
17632,BOOK XXII.,"Peleus, by whom he was begot, and bred,"
17633,BOOK XXII.,"The bane of Troy; and, most of all, to me"
17634,BOOK XXII.,"The cause of endless grief, who by his hand"
17635,BOOK XXII.,Have been of many stalwart sons bereft.
17636,BOOK XXII.,"Yet all, though griev’d for all, I less lament,"
17637,BOOK XXII.,"Than one, whose loss will sink me to the grave,"
17638,BOOK XXII.,Hector! oh would to Heav’n that in mine arms
17639,BOOK XXII.,He could have died; with mourning then and tears
17640,BOOK XXII.,"We might have satisfied our grief, both she"
17641,BOOK XXII.,"Who bore him, hapless mother, and myself.”"
17642,BOOK XXII.,
17643,BOOK XXII.,"Weeping, he spoke; and with him wept the crowd:"
17644,BOOK XXII.,"Then, ’mid the women, Hecuba pour’d forth"
17645,BOOK XXII.,"Her vehement grief: “My child, oh whither now,"
17646,BOOK XXII.,"Heart-stricken, shall I go, of thee bereft,"
17647,BOOK XXII.,"Of thee, who wast to me by night and day"
17648,BOOK XXII.,A glory and a boast; the strength of all
17649,BOOK XXII.,"The men of Troy, and women? as a God"
17650,BOOK XXII.,They worshipp’d thee: for in thy life thou wast
17651,BOOK XXII.,The glory of all; but fate hath found thee now.”
17652,BOOK XXII.,
17653,BOOK XXII.,"Weeping, she spoke; but nought as yet was known"
17654,BOOK XXII.,To Hector’s wife; to her no messenger
17655,BOOK XXII.,"Had brought the tidings, that without the walls"
17656,BOOK XXII.,Remained her husband; in her house withdrawn
17657,BOOK XXII.,"A web she wove, all purple, double woof,"
17658,BOOK XXII.,"With varied flow’rs in rich embroidery,"
17659,BOOK XXII.,And to her neat-hair’d maidens gave command
17660,BOOK XXII.,"To place the largest caldrons on the fire,"
17661,BOOK XXII.,"That with warm baths, returning from the fight,"
17662,BOOK XXII.,"Hector might be refresh’d; unconscious she,"
17663,BOOK XXII.,"That by Achilles’ hand, with Pallas’ aid,"
17664,BOOK XXII.,"Far from the bath, was godlike Hector slain."
17665,BOOK XXII.,The sounds of wailing reach’d her from the tow’r;
17666,BOOK XXII.,"Totter’d her limbs, the distaff left her hand,"
17667,BOOK XXII.,And to her neat-hair’d maidens thus she spoke:
17668,BOOK XXII.,"“Haste, follow me, some two, that I may know"
17669,BOOK XXII.,What mean these sounds; my honour’d mother’s voice
17670,BOOK XXII.,I hear; and in my breast my beating heart
17671,BOOK XXII.,Leaps to my mouth; my limbs refuse to move;
17672,BOOK XXII.,"Some evil, sure, on Priam’s house impends."
17673,BOOK XXII.,Be unfulfill’d my words! yet much I fear
17674,BOOK XXII.,"Lest my brave Hector be cut off alone,"
17675,BOOK XXII.,"By great Achilles, from the walls of Troy,"
17676,BOOK XXII.,"Chas’d to the plain, the desp’rate courage quench’d,"
17677,BOOK XXII.,Which ever led him from the gen’ral ranks
17678,BOOK XXII.,"Far in advance, and bade him yield to none.”"
17679,BOOK XXII.,
17680,BOOK XXII.,"Then from the house she rush’d, like one distract,"
17681,BOOK XXII.,With beating heart; and with her went her maids.
17682,BOOK XXII.,"But when she reach’d the tow’r, where stood the crowd,"
17683,BOOK XXII.,"And mounted on the wall, she look’d around,"
17684,BOOK XXII.,And saw the body which with insult foul
17685,BOOK XXII.,The flying steeds were dragging towards the ships;
17686,BOOK XXII.,Then sudden darkness overspread her eyes;
17687,BOOK XXII.,"Backward she fell, and gasp’d her spirit away."
17688,BOOK XXII.,"Far off were flung th’ adornments of her head,"
17689,BOOK XXII.,"The net, the fillet, and the woven bands;"
17690,BOOK XXII.,"The nuptial veil by golden Venus giv’n,"
17691,BOOK XXII.,That day when Hector of the glancing helm
17692,BOOK XXII.,Led from Eetion’s house his wealthy bride.
17693,BOOK XXII.,"The sisters of her husband round her press’d,"
17694,BOOK XXII.,"And held, as in the deadly swoon she lay."
17695,BOOK XXII.,"But when her breath and spirit return’d again,"
17696,BOOK XXII.,With sudden burst of anguish thus she cried:
17697,BOOK XXII.,"“Hector, oh woe is me! to misery"
17698,BOOK XXII.,We both were born alike; thou here in Troy
17699,BOOK XXII.,"In Priam’s royal palace; I in Thebes,"
17700,BOOK XXII.,"By wooded Placos, in Eetion’s house,"
17701,BOOK XXII.,"Who nurs’d my infancy; unhappy he,"
17702,BOOK XXII.,Unhappier I! would I had ne’er been born!
17703,BOOK XXII.,"Now thou beneath the depths of earth art gone,"
17704,BOOK XXII.,Gone to the viewless shades; and me hast left
17705,BOOK XXII.,"A widow in thy house, in deepest woe;"
17706,BOOK XXII.,"Our child, an infant still, thy child and mine,"
17707,BOOK XXII.,"Ill-fated parents both! nor thou to him,"
17708,BOOK XXII.,"Hector, shalt be a guard, nor he to thee:"
17709,BOOK XXII.,"For though he ’scape this tearful war with Greece,"
17710,BOOK XXII.,"Yet nought for him remains but ceaseless woe,"
17711,BOOK XXII.,And strangers on his heritage shall seize.
17712,BOOK XXII.,No young companions own the orphan boy:
17713,BOOK XXII.,"With downcast eyes, and cheeks bedew’d with tears,"
17714,BOOK XXII.,"His father’s friends approaching, pinch’d with want,"
17715,BOOK XXII.,"He hangs upon the skirt of one, of one"
17716,BOOK XXII.,He plucks the cloak; perchance in pity some
17717,BOOK XXII.,"May at their tables let him sip the cup,"
17718,BOOK XXII.,"Moisten his lips, but scarce his palate touch;"
17719,BOOK XXII.,"While youths, with both surviving parents bless’d,"
17720,BOOK XXII.,"May drive him from their feast with blows and taunts,"
17721,BOOK XXII.,‘Begone! thy father sits not at our board:’
17722,BOOK XXII.,"Then weeping, to his widow’d mother’s arms"
17723,BOOK XXII.,"He flies, that orphan boy, Astyanax,"
17724,BOOK XXII.,Who on his father’s knees erewhile was fed
17725,BOOK XXII.,"On choicest marrow, and the fat of lambs;"
17726,BOOK XXII.,"And, when in sleep his childish play was hush’d,"
17727,BOOK XXII.,Was lull’d to slumber in his nurse’s arms
17728,BOOK XXII.,"On softest couch, by all delights surrounded."
17729,BOOK XXII.,"But grief, his father lost, awaits him now,"
17730,BOOK XXII.,"Astyanax, of Trojans so surnam’d,"
17731,BOOK XXII.,Since thou alone wast Troy’s defence and guard.
17732,BOOK XXII.,"But now on thee, beside the beaked ships,"
17733,BOOK XXII.,"Far from thy parents, when the rav’ning dogs"
17734,BOOK XXII.,"Have had their fill, the wriggling worms shall feed;"
17735,BOOK XXII.,"On thee, all naked; while within thy house"
17736,BOOK XXII.,"Lies store of raiment, rich and rare, the work"
17737,BOOK XXII.,Of women’s hands; these will I burn with fire;
17738,BOOK XXII.,"Not for thy need—thou ne’er shalt wear them more,—"
17739,BOOK XXII.,But for thine honour in the sight of Troy.”
17740,BOOK XXII.,
17741,BOOK XXII.,Weeping she spoke; the women join’d her wail.

17774,BOOK XXIII.,Thus they throughout the city made their moan;
17775,BOOK XXIII.,But when the Greeks had come where lay their ships
17776,BOOK XXIII.,"By the broad Hellespont, their sev’ral ways"
17777,BOOK XXIII.,"They each pursu’d, dispersing; yet not so"
17778,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles let his Myrmidons disperse,"
17779,BOOK XXIII.,But thus his warlike comrades he address’d:
17780,BOOK XXIII.,
17781,BOOK XXIII.,"“My faithful comrades, valiant Myrmidons,"
17782,BOOK XXIII.,Loose we not yet our horses from the cars;
17783,BOOK XXIII.,"But for Patroclus mourn, approaching near,"
17784,BOOK XXIII.,With horse and car; such tribute claim the dead;
17785,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, free indulgence to our sorrows giv’n,"
17786,BOOK XXIII.,"Loose we the steeds, and share the ev’ning meal.”"
17787,BOOK XXIII.,
17788,BOOK XXIII.,He said; and they with mingled voices rais’d
17789,BOOK XXIII.,The solemn dirge; Achilles led the strain;
17790,BOOK XXIII.,"Thrice round the dead they drove their sleek-skinn’d steeds,"
17791,BOOK XXIII.,"Mourning, with hearts by Thetis grief-inspir’d;"
17792,BOOK XXIII.,"With tears the sands, with tears the warriors’ arms,"
17793,BOOK XXIII.,Were wet; so mighty was the chief they mourn’d.
17794,BOOK XXIII.,Then on his comrade’s breast Achilles laid
17795,BOOK XXIII.,"His blood-stain’d hands, and thus began the wail:"
17796,BOOK XXIII.,
17797,BOOK XXIII.,"“All hail, Patroclus, though in Pluto’s realm;"
17798,BOOK XXIII.,"All that I promis’d, lo! I now perform;"
17799,BOOK XXIII.,"That on the corpse of Hector, hither dragg’d,"
17800,BOOK XXIII.,"Our dogs should feed; and that twelve noble youths,"
17801,BOOK XXIII.,"The sons of Troy, before thy fun’ral pyre,"
17802,BOOK XXIII.,"My hand, in vengeance for thy death, should slay.”"
17803,BOOK XXIII.,
17804,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and foully Hector’s corpse misus’d,"
17805,BOOK XXIII.,"Flung prostrate in the dust, beside the couch"
17806,BOOK XXIII.,Where lay Menoetius’ son. His comrades then
17807,BOOK XXIII.,"Their glitt’ring armour doff’d, of polish’d brass,"
17808,BOOK XXIII.,And loos’d their neighing steeds; then round the ship
17809,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Peleus’ son in countless numbers sat,"
17810,BOOK XXIII.,While he th’ abundant fun’ral feast dispens’d.
17811,BOOK XXIII.,"There many a steer lay stretch’d beneath the knife,"
17812,BOOK XXIII.,"And many a sheep, and many a bleating goat,"
17813,BOOK XXIII.,"And many a white-tusk’d porker, rich in fat,"
17814,BOOK XXIII.,"There lay extended, singeing o’er the fire;"
17815,BOOK XXIII.,"And blood, in torrents, flow’d around the corpse."
17816,BOOK XXIII.,To Agamemnon then the Kings of Greece
17817,BOOK XXIII.,"The royal son of Peleus, swift of foot,"
17818,BOOK XXIII.,Conducted; yet with him they scarce prevail’d;
17819,BOOK XXIII.,So fierce his anger for his comrade’s death.
17820,BOOK XXIII.,"But when to Agamemnon’s tent they came,"
17821,BOOK XXIII.,He to the clear-voic’d heralds gave command
17822,BOOK XXIII.,An ample tripod on the fire to place;
17823,BOOK XXIII.,If haply Peleus’ son he might persuade
17824,BOOK XXIII.,To wash away the bloody stains of war:
17825,BOOK XXIII.,"But sternly he, and with an oath refus’d."
17826,BOOK XXIII.,
17827,BOOK XXIII.,"“No, by great Jove I swear, of all the Gods"
17828,BOOK XXIII.,"Highest and mightiest, water shall not touch"
17829,BOOK XXIII.,"This head of mine, till on the fun’ral pyre"
17830,BOOK XXIII.,"I see the body of Patroclus laid,"
17831,BOOK XXIII.,"And build his tomb, and cut my votive hair;"
17832,BOOK XXIII.,"For while I live and move ’mid mortal men,"
17833,BOOK XXIII.,No second grief like this can pierce my soul.
17834,BOOK XXIII.,Observe we now the mournful fun’ral feast;
17835,BOOK XXIII.,"But thou, great Agamemnon, King of men,"
17836,BOOK XXIII.,"Send forth at early dawn, and to the camp"
17837,BOOK XXIII.,"Bring store of fuel, and all else prepare,"
17838,BOOK XXIII.,That with provision meet the dead may pass
17839,BOOK XXIII.,Down to the realms of night; so shall the fire
17840,BOOK XXIII.,"From out our sight consume our mighty dead,"
17841,BOOK XXIII.,And to their wonted tasks the troops return.”
17842,BOOK XXIII.,
17843,BOOK XXIII.,"He said; they listen’d, and his words obey’d;"
17844,BOOK XXIII.,"Then busily the ev’ning meal prepar’d,"
17845,BOOK XXIII.,And shar’d the social feast; nor lack’d there aught.
17846,BOOK XXIII.,"The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,"
17847,BOOK XXIII.,Each to their sev’ral tents the rest repair’d;
17848,BOOK XXIII.,But on the many-dashing ocean’s shore
17849,BOOK XXIII.,"Pelides lay, amid his Myrmidons,"
17850,BOOK XXIII.,"With bitter groans; in a clear space he lay,"
17851,BOOK XXIII.,"Where broke the waves, continuous, on the beach."
17852,BOOK XXIII.,"There, circumfus’d around him, gentle sleep,"
17853,BOOK XXIII.,"Lulling the sorrows of his heart to rest,"
17854,BOOK XXIII.,O’ercame his senses; for the hot pursuit
17855,BOOK XXIII.,Of Hector round the breezy heights of Troy
17856,BOOK XXIII.,"His active limbs had wearied: as he slept,"
17857,BOOK XXIII.,"Sudden appear’d Patroclus’ mournful shade,"
17858,BOOK XXIII.,"His very self; his height, and beauteous eyes,"
17859,BOOK XXIII.,And voice; the very garb he wont to wear:
17860,BOOK XXIII.,"Above his head it stood, and thus it spoke:"
17861,BOOK XXIII.,
17862,BOOK XXIII.,"“Sleep’st thou, Achilles, mindless of thy friend,"
17863,BOOK XXIII.,"Neglecting, not the living, but the dead?"
17864,BOOK XXIII.,"Hasten my fun’ral rites, that I may pass"
17865,BOOK XXIII.,"Through Hades’ gloomy gates; ere those be done,"
17866,BOOK XXIII.,The spirits and spectres of departed men
17867,BOOK XXIII.,"Drive me far from them, nor allow to cross"
17868,BOOK XXIII.,Th’ abhorred river; but forlorn and sad
17869,BOOK XXIII.,I wander through the wide-spread realms of night.
17870,BOOK XXIII.,"And give me now thy hand, whereon to weep;"
17871,BOOK XXIII.,"For never more, when laid upon the pyre,"
17872,BOOK XXIII.,"Shall I return from Hades; never more,"
17873,BOOK XXIII.,"Apart from all our comrades, shall we two,"
17874,BOOK XXIII.,"As friends, sweet counsel take; for me, stern Death,"
17875,BOOK XXIII.,"The common lot of man, has op’d his mouth;"
17876,BOOK XXIII.,"Thou too, Achilles, rival of the Gods,"
17877,BOOK XXIII.,Art destin’d here beneath the walls of Troy
17878,BOOK XXIII.,"To meet thy doom; yet one thing must I add,"
17879,BOOK XXIII.,"And make, if thou wilt grant it, one request."
17880,BOOK XXIII.,"Let not my bones be laid apart from thine,"
17881,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles, but together, as our youth"
17882,BOOK XXIII.,"Was spent together in thy father’s house,"
17883,BOOK XXIII.,Since first my sire Menoetius me a boy
17884,BOOK XXIII.,"From Opus brought, a luckless homicide,"
17885,BOOK XXIII.,"Who of Amphidamas, by evil chance,"
17886,BOOK XXIII.,"Had slain the son, disputing o’er the dice:"
17887,BOOK XXIII.,"Me noble Peleus in his house receiv’d,"
17888,BOOK XXIII.,"And kindly nurs’d, and thine attendant nam’d;"
17889,BOOK XXIII.,"So in one urn be now our bones enclos’d,"
17890,BOOK XXIII.,"The golden vase, thy Goddess-mother’s gift.”"
17891,BOOK XXIII.,
17892,BOOK XXIII.,"Whom answer’d thus Achilles, swift of foot:"
17893,BOOK XXIII.,"“Why art thou here, lov’d being? why on me"
17894,BOOK XXIII.,These sev’ral charges lay? whate’er thou bidd’st
17895,BOOK XXIII.,"Will I perform, and all thy mind fulfil;"
17896,BOOK XXIII.,"But draw thou near; and in one short embrace,"
17897,BOOK XXIII.,"Let us, while yet we may, our grief indulge.”"
17898,BOOK XXIII.,
17899,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus as he spoke, he spread his longing arms,"
17900,BOOK XXIII.,"But nought he clasp’d; and with a wailing cry,"
17901,BOOK XXIII.,"Vanish’d, like smoke, the spirit beneath the earth."
17902,BOOK XXIII.,"Up sprang Achilles, all amaz’d, and smote"
17903,BOOK XXIII.,"His hands together, and lamenting cried:"
17904,BOOK XXIII.,
17905,BOOK XXIII.,"“O Heav’n, there are then, in the realms below,"
17906,BOOK XXIII.,"Spirits and spectres, unsubstantial all;"
17907,BOOK XXIII.,"For through the night Patroclus’ shade hath stood,"
17908,BOOK XXIII.,"Weeping and wailing, at my side, and told"
17909,BOOK XXIII.,His bidding; th’ image of himself it seem’d.”
17910,BOOK XXIII.,
17911,BOOK XXIII.,He said; his words the gen’ral grief arous’d:
17912,BOOK XXIII.,"To them, as round the piteous dead they mourn’d,"
17913,BOOK XXIII.,"Appear’d the rosy-finger’d morn; and straight,"
17914,BOOK XXIII.,"From all the camp, by Agamemnon sent,"
17915,BOOK XXIII.,"Went forth, in search of fuel, men and mules,"
17916,BOOK XXIII.,"Led by a valiant chief, Meriones,"
17917,BOOK XXIII.,The follower of renown’d Idomeneus.
17918,BOOK XXIII.,"Their felling axes in their hands they bore,"
17919,BOOK XXIII.,And twisted ropes; their mules before them driv’n;
17920,BOOK XXIII.,"Now up, now down, now sideways, now aslope,"
17921,BOOK XXIII.,They journey’d on; but when they reach’d the foot
17922,BOOK XXIII.,"Of spring-abounding Ida, they began"
17923,BOOK XXIII.,With axes keen to hew the lofty oaks;
17924,BOOK XXIII.,"They, loudly crashing, fell: the wood they clove,"
17925,BOOK XXIII.,And bound it to the mules; these took their way
17926,BOOK XXIII.,"Through the thick brushwood, hurrying to the plain."
17927,BOOK XXIII.,"The axe-men too, so bade Meriones,"
17928,BOOK XXIII.,"The follower of renown’d Idomeneus,"
17929,BOOK XXIII.,"Were laden all with logs, which on the beach"
17930,BOOK XXIII.,"They laid in order, where a lofty mound,"
17931,BOOK XXIII.,"In mem’ry of Patroclus and himself,"
17932,BOOK XXIII.,Achilles had design’d. When all the store
17933,BOOK XXIII.,"Of wood was duly laid, the rest remain’d"
17934,BOOK XXIII.,In masses seated; but Achilles bade
17935,BOOK XXIII.,"The warlike Myrmidons their armour don,"
17936,BOOK XXIII.,And harness each his horses to his car;
17937,BOOK XXIII.,"They rose and donn’d their arms, and on the cars"
17938,BOOK XXIII.,Warriors and charioteers their places took.
17939,BOOK XXIII.,
17940,BOOK XXIII.,"First came the horse, and then a cloud of foot,"
17941,BOOK XXIII.,"Unnumber’d; in the midst Patroclus came,"
17942,BOOK XXIII.,Borne by his comrades; all the corpse with hair
17943,BOOK XXIII.,"They cover’d o’er, which from their heads they shore."
17944,BOOK XXIII.,"Behind, Achilles held his head, and mourn’d"
17945,BOOK XXIII.,The noble friend whom to the tomb he bore.
17946,BOOK XXIII.,"Then on the spot by Peleus’ son assign’d,"
17947,BOOK XXIII.,"They laid him down, and pil’d the wood on high."
17948,BOOK XXIII.,Then a fresh thought Achilles’ mind conceiv’d:
17949,BOOK XXIII.,"Standing apart, the yellow locks he shore,"
17950,BOOK XXIII.,"Which as an off’ring to Sperchius’ stream,"
17951,BOOK XXIII.,He nurs’d in rich profusion; sorrowing then
17952,BOOK XXIII.,"Look’d o’er the dark-blue sea, as thus he spoke:"
17953,BOOK XXIII.,
17954,BOOK XXIII.,"“Sperchius, all in vain to thee his pray’r"
17955,BOOK XXIII.,"My father Peleus made, and vow’d that I,"
17956,BOOK XXIII.,"Return’d in safety to my native land,"
17957,BOOK XXIII.,"To thee should dedicate my hair, and pay"
17958,BOOK XXIII.,"A solemn hecatomb, with sacrifice"
17959,BOOK XXIII.,"Of fifty rams, unblemish’d, to the springs"
17960,BOOK XXIII.,Where on thy consecrated soil is plac’d
17961,BOOK XXIII.,Thine incense-honour’d altar; so he vow’d;
17962,BOOK XXIII.,But thou the boon withhold’st; since I no more
17963,BOOK XXIII.,"My native land may see, the hair he vow’d,"
17964,BOOK XXIII.,To brave Patroclus thus I dedicate.”
17965,BOOK XXIII.,
17966,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and on his comrade’s hand he laid"
17967,BOOK XXIII.,The locks; his act the gen’ral grief arous’d;
17968,BOOK XXIII.,And now the setting sun had found them still
17969,BOOK XXIII.,Indulging o’er the dead; but Peleus’ son
17970,BOOK XXIII.,"Approaching, thus to Agamemnon spoke:"
17971,BOOK XXIII.,
17972,BOOK XXIII.,"“Atrides, for to thee the people pay"
17973,BOOK XXIII.,"Readiest obedience, mourning too prolong’d"
17974,BOOK XXIII.,May weary; thou then from the pyre the rest
17975,BOOK XXIII.,"Disperse, and bid prepare the morning meal;"
17976,BOOK XXIII.,"Ours be the farther charge, to whom the dead"
17977,BOOK XXIII.,Was chiefly dear; yet let the chiefs remain.”
17978,BOOK XXIII.,
17979,BOOK XXIII.,"The monarch Agamemnon heard, and straight"
17980,BOOK XXIII.,Dispers’d the crowd amid their sev’ral ships.
17981,BOOK XXIII.,"Th’ appointed band remain’d, and pil’d the wood."
17982,BOOK XXIII.,"A hundred feet each way they built the pyre,"
17983,BOOK XXIII.,"And on the summit, sorrowing, laid the dead."
17984,BOOK XXIII.,Then many a sheep and many a slow-paced ox
17985,BOOK XXIII.,They flay’d and dress’d around the fun’ral pyre;
17986,BOOK XXIII.,"Of all the beasts Achilles took the fat,"
17987,BOOK XXIII.,"And cover’d o’er the corpse from head to foot,"
17988,BOOK XXIII.,And heap’d the slaughter’d carcases around;
17989,BOOK XXIII.,"Then jars of honey plac’d, and fragrant oils,"
17990,BOOK XXIII.,"Resting upon the couch; next, groaning loud,"
17991,BOOK XXIII.,Four pow’rful horses on the pyre he threw;
17992,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, of nine dogs that at their master’s board"
17993,BOOK XXIII.,"Had fed, he slaughter’d two upon his pyre;"
17994,BOOK XXIII.,"Last, with the sword, by evil counsel sway’d,"
17995,BOOK XXIII.,"Twelve noble youths he slew, the sons of Troy."
17996,BOOK XXIII.,"The fire’s devouring might he then applied,"
17997,BOOK XXIII.,"And, groaning, on his lov’d companion call’d:"
17998,BOOK XXIII.,
17999,BOOK XXIII.,"“All hail, Patroclus, though in Pluto’s realm!"
18000,BOOK XXIII.,"All that I promis’d, lo! I now perform:"
18001,BOOK XXIII.,"On twelve brave sons of Trojan sires, with thee,"
18002,BOOK XXIII.,"The flames shall feed; but Hector, Priam’s son,"
18003,BOOK XXIII.,"Not to the fire, but to the dogs I give.”"
18004,BOOK XXIII.,
18005,BOOK XXIII.,"Such was Achilles’ threat, but him the dogs"
18006,BOOK XXIII.,"Molested not; for Venus, night and day"
18007,BOOK XXIII.,"Daughter of Jove, the rav’ning dogs restrain’d;"
18008,BOOK XXIII.,"And all the corpse o’erlaid with roseate oil,"
18009,BOOK XXIII.,"Ambrosial, that though dragg’d along the earth,"
18010,BOOK XXIII.,The noble dead might not receive a wound.
18011,BOOK XXIII.,Apollo too a cloudy veil from Heav’n
18012,BOOK XXIII.,"Spread o’er the plain, and cover’d all the space"
18013,BOOK XXIII.,"Where lay the dead, nor let the blazing sun"
18014,BOOK XXIII.,The flesh upon his limbs and muscles parch.
18015,BOOK XXIII.,Yet burnt not up Patroclus’ fun’ral pyre;
18016,BOOK XXIII.,Then a fresh thought Achilles’ mind conceiv’d:
18017,BOOK XXIII.,"Standing apart, on both the Winds he call’d,"
18018,BOOK XXIII.,"Boreas and Zephyrus, and added vows"
18019,BOOK XXIII.,Of costly sacrifice; and pouring forth
18020,BOOK XXIII.,"Libations from a golden goblet, pray’d"
18021,BOOK XXIII.,"Their presence, that the wood might haste to burn,"
18022,BOOK XXIII.,And with the fire consume the dead; his pray’r
18023,BOOK XXIII.,"Swift Iris heard, and bore it to the Winds."
18024,BOOK XXIII.,They in the hall of gusty Zephyrus
18025,BOOK XXIII.,"Were gather’d round the feast; in haste appearing,"
18026,BOOK XXIII.,Swift Iris on the stony threshold stood.
18027,BOOK XXIII.,"They saw, and rising all, besought her each"
18028,BOOK XXIII.,To sit beside him; she with their requests
18029,BOOK XXIII.,"Refus’d compliance, and address’d them thus:"
18030,BOOK XXIII.,
18031,BOOK XXIII.,“No seat for me; for I o’er th’ ocean stream
18032,BOOK XXIII.,"From hence am bound to Æthiopia’s shore,"
18033,BOOK XXIII.,"To share the sacred feast, and hecatombs,"
18034,BOOK XXIII.,Which there they offer to th’ immortal Gods;
18035,BOOK XXIII.,"But, Boreas, thee, and loud-voic’d Zephyrus,"
18036,BOOK XXIII.,"With vows of sacrifice, Achilles calls"
18037,BOOK XXIII.,"To fan the fun’ral pyre, whereon is laid"
18038,BOOK XXIII.,"Patroclus, mourn’d by all the host of Greece.”"
18039,BOOK XXIII.,
18040,BOOK XXIII.,"She said, and vanish’d; they, with rushing sound,"
18041,BOOK XXIII.,"Rose, and before them drove the hurrying clouds:"
18042,BOOK XXIII.,Soon o’er the sea they swept; the stirring breeze
18043,BOOK XXIII.,Ruffled the waves; the fertile shores of Troy
18044,BOOK XXIII.,"They reach’d, and falling on the fun’ral pyre,"
18045,BOOK XXIII.,Loud roar’d the crackling flames; they all night long
18046,BOOK XXIII.,With current brisk together fann’d the fire.
18047,BOOK XXIII.,All night Achilles from a golden bowl
18048,BOOK XXIII.,"Drew forth, and, in his hand a double cup,"
18049,BOOK XXIII.,"The wine outpouring, moisten’d all the earth,"
18050,BOOK XXIII.,Still calling on his lost Patroclus’ shade.
18051,BOOK XXIII.,"As mourns a father o’er a youthful son,"
18052,BOOK XXIII.,Whose early death hath wrung his parents’ hearts;
18053,BOOK XXIII.,"So mourn’d Achilles o’er his friend’s remains,"
18054,BOOK XXIII.,"Prostrate beside the pyre, and groan’d aloud."
18055,BOOK XXIII.,"But when the star of Lucifer appear’d,"
18056,BOOK XXIII.,"The harbinger of light, whom following close"
18057,BOOK XXIII.,"Spreads o’er the sea the saffron-robed morn,"
18058,BOOK XXIII.,"Then pal’d the smould’ring fire, and sank the flame;"
18059,BOOK XXIII.,"And o’er the Thracian sea, that groan’d and heav’d"
18060,BOOK XXIII.,"Beneath their passage, home the Winds return’d;"
18061,BOOK XXIII.,"And weary, from the pyre a space withdrawn,"
18062,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles lay, o’ercome by gentle sleep."
18063,BOOK XXIII.,
18064,BOOK XXIII.,"Anon, awaken’d by the tramp and din"
18065,BOOK XXIII.,"Of crowds that follow’d Atreus’ royal son,"
18066,BOOK XXIII.,"He sat upright, and thus address’d his speech:"
18067,BOOK XXIII.,
18068,BOOK XXIII.,"“Thou son of Atreus, and ye chiefs of Greece,"
18069,BOOK XXIII.,"Far as the flames extended, quench we first"
18070,BOOK XXIII.,With ruddy wine the embers of the pyre;
18071,BOOK XXIII.,"And of Menoetius’ son, Patroclus, next"
18072,BOOK XXIII.,"With care distinguishing, collect the bones;"
18073,BOOK XXIII.,Nor are they hard to know; for in the midst
18074,BOOK XXIII.,"He lay, while round the edges of the pyre,"
18075,BOOK XXIII.,"Horses and men commix’d, the rest were burnt."
18076,BOOK XXIII.,"Let these, between a double layer of fat"
18077,BOOK XXIII.,"Enclos’d, and in a golden urn remain,"
18078,BOOK XXIII.,Till I myself shall in the tomb be laid;
18079,BOOK XXIII.,"And o’er them build a mound, not over-large,"
18080,BOOK XXIII.,"But of proportions meet; in days to come,"
18081,BOOK XXIII.,"Ye Greeks, who after me shall here remain,"
18082,BOOK XXIII.,"Complete the work, and build it broad and high.”"
18083,BOOK XXIII.,
18084,BOOK XXIII.,Thus spoke Achilles; they his words obey’d:
18085,BOOK XXIII.,"Far as the flames had reach’d, and thickly strown"
18086,BOOK XXIII.,"The embers lay, they quench’d with ruddy wine;"
18087,BOOK XXIII.,Then tearfully their gentle comrade’s bones
18088,BOOK XXIII.,"Collected, and with double layers of fat"
18089,BOOK XXIII.,"Enclos’d, and in a golden urn encas’d;"
18090,BOOK XXIII.,"Then in the tent they laid them, overspread"
18091,BOOK XXIII.,With veil of linen fair; then meting out
18092,BOOK XXIII.,"Th’ allotted space, the deep foundations laid"
18093,BOOK XXIII.,"Around the pyre, and o’er them heap’d the earth."
18094,BOOK XXIII.,"Their task accomplished, all had now withdrawn;"
18095,BOOK XXIII.,"But Peleus’ son the vast assembly stay’d,"
18096,BOOK XXIII.,"And bade them sit; then, prizes of the games,"
18097,BOOK XXIII.,"Tripods and caldrons from the tents he brought,"
18098,BOOK XXIII.,"And noble steeds, and mules, and sturdy steers,"
18099,BOOK XXIII.,"And women fair of form, and iron hoar."
18100,BOOK XXIII.,
18101,BOOK XXIII.,"First, for the contest of the flying cars"
18102,BOOK XXIII.,"The prizes he display’d: a woman fair,"
18103,BOOK XXIII.,"Well skill’d in household cares; a tripod vast,"
18104,BOOK XXIII.,"Two-handled, two and twenty measures round;"
18105,BOOK XXIII.,"These both were for the victor: for the next,"
18106,BOOK XXIII.,"A mare, unbroken, six years old, in foal"
18107,BOOK XXIII.,"Of a mule colt; the third, a caldron bright,"
18108,BOOK XXIII.,"Capacious of four measures, white and pure,"
18109,BOOK XXIII.,"By fire as yet untarnish’d; for the fourth,"
18110,BOOK XXIII.,"Of gold two talents; for the fifth, a vase"
18111,BOOK XXIII.,"With double cup, untouch’d by fire, he gave."
18112,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, standing up, he thus address’d the Greeks:"
18113,BOOK XXIII.,
18114,BOOK XXIII.,"“Thou son of Atreus, and ye well-greav’d Greeks,"
18115,BOOK XXIII.,"Before ye are the prizes, which await"
18116,BOOK XXIII.,"The contest of the cars; but if, ye Greeks,"
18117,BOOK XXIII.,"For any other cause these games were held,"
18118,BOOK XXIII.,I to my tent should bear the foremost prize;
18119,BOOK XXIII.,"For well ye know how far my steeds excel,"
18120,BOOK XXIII.,"Steeds of immortal race, which Neptune gave"
18121,BOOK XXIII.,"To Peleus, he to me, his son, transferr’d."
18122,BOOK XXIII.,"But from the present strife we stand aloof,"
18123,BOOK XXIII.,My horses and myself; they now have lost
18124,BOOK XXIII.,The daring courage and the gentle hand
18125,BOOK XXIII.,"Of him who drove them, and with water pure"
18126,BOOK XXIII.,"Wash’d oft their manes, and bath’d with fragrant oil."
18127,BOOK XXIII.,"For him they stand and mourn, with drooping heads"
18128,BOOK XXIII.,"Down to the ground, their hearts with sorrow fill’d;"
18129,BOOK XXIII.,"But ye in order range yourselves, who boast"
18130,BOOK XXIII.,Your well-built chariots and your horses’ speed.”
18131,BOOK XXIII.,
18132,BOOK XXIII.,He said: up sprang the eager charioteers;
18133,BOOK XXIII.,"The first of all, Eumelus, King of men,"
18134,BOOK XXIII.,"Son of Admetus, matchless charioteer;"
18135,BOOK XXIII.,"Next, Tydeus’ son, the valiant Diomed,"
18136,BOOK XXIII.,"With Trojan horses, from Æneas won,"
18137,BOOK XXIII.,When by Apollo’s aid himself escap’d;
18138,BOOK XXIII.,"Then Heav’n-born Menelaus, Atreus’ son,"
18139,BOOK XXIII.,Two flying coursers harness’d to his car;
18140,BOOK XXIII.,"His own, Podargus, had for yokefellow"
18141,BOOK XXIII.,"Æthe, a mare by Agamemnon lent:"
18142,BOOK XXIII.,"Her, Echepolus to Atrides gave,"
18143,BOOK XXIII.,"Anchises’ son, that to the wars of Troy"
18144,BOOK XXIII.,"He might not be compell’d, but safe at home"
18145,BOOK XXIII.,Enjoy his ease; for Jove had bless’d his store
18146,BOOK XXIII.,"With ample wealth, in Sicyon’s wide domain."
18147,BOOK XXIII.,"Her now he yok’d, impatient for the course."
18148,BOOK XXIII.,"The fourth, Antilochus, the gallant son"
18149,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Nestor, son of Neleus, mighty chief,"
18150,BOOK XXIII.,Harness’d his sleek-skinn’d steeds; of Pylian race
18151,BOOK XXIII.,"Were they who bore his car; to him, his sire"
18152,BOOK XXIII.,Sage counsel pour’d in understanding ears:
18153,BOOK XXIII.,
18154,BOOK XXIII.,"“Antilochus, though young in years thou art,"
18155,BOOK XXIII.,"Yet Jove and Neptune love thee, and have well"
18156,BOOK XXIII.,Instructed thee in horsemanship; of me
18157,BOOK XXIII.,Thou need’st no counsel; skill’d around the goal
18158,BOOK XXIII.,"To whirl the chariot; but thou hast, of all,"
18159,BOOK XXIII.,The slowest horses: whence I augur ill.
18160,BOOK XXIII.,"But though their horses have the speed of thine,"
18161,BOOK XXIII.,In skill not one of them surpasses thee.
18162,BOOK XXIII.,"Then thou, dear boy, exert thine ev’ry art,"
18163,BOOK XXIII.,That so thou mayst not fail to gain a prize.
18164,BOOK XXIII.,"By skill, far more than strength, the woodman fells"
18165,BOOK XXIII.,The sturdy oak; by skill the steersman guides
18166,BOOK XXIII.,"His flying ship across the dark-blue sea,"
18167,BOOK XXIII.,Though shatter’d by the blast; ’twixt charioteer
18168,BOOK XXIII.,And charioteer ’tis skill that draws the line.
18169,BOOK XXIII.,"One, vainly trusting to his coursers’ speed,"
18170,BOOK XXIII.,"Drives reckless here and there; o’er all the course,"
18171,BOOK XXIII.,"His horses, unrestrain’d, at random run."
18172,BOOK XXIII.,"Another, with inferior horses far,"
18173,BOOK XXIII.,"But better skill’d, still fixing on the goal"
18174,BOOK XXIII.,"His eye, turns closely round, nor overlooks"
18175,BOOK XXIII.,The moment when to draw the rein; but holds
18176,BOOK XXIII.,"His steady course, and on the leader waits."
18177,BOOK XXIII.,"A mark I give thee now, thou canst not miss:"
18178,BOOK XXIII.,"There stands a wither’d trunk, some six feet high,"
18179,BOOK XXIII.,"Of oak, or pine, unrotted by the rain;"
18180,BOOK XXIII.,"On either side have two white stones been plac’d,"
18181,BOOK XXIII.,Where meet two roads; and all around there lies
18182,BOOK XXIII.,A smooth and level course; here stood perchance
18183,BOOK XXIII.,The tomb of one who died long years ago;
18184,BOOK XXIII.,"Or former generations here have plac’d,"
18185,BOOK XXIII.,"As now Achilles hath decreed, a goal."
18186,BOOK XXIII.,"There drive, as only not to graze the post;"
18187,BOOK XXIII.,"And leaning o’er the wicker body, leave"
18188,BOOK XXIII.,Close on the left the stones; thine offside horse
18189,BOOK XXIII.,"Then urge with voice and whip, and slack his rein,"
18190,BOOK XXIII.,"And let the nearside horse so closely graze,"
18191,BOOK XXIII.,"As that thy nave may seem to touch, the goal:"
18192,BOOK XXIII.,"But yet beware, lest, striking on the stone,"
18193,BOOK XXIII.,"Thy steeds thou injure, and thy chariot break,"
18194,BOOK XXIII.,"A source of triumph to thy rivals all,"
18195,BOOK XXIII.,Of shame to thee; but thou sage caution use;
18196,BOOK XXIII.,"For, following, if thou make the turn the first,"
18197,BOOK XXIII.,"Not one of all shall pass thee, or o’ertake;"
18198,BOOK XXIII.,"Not though Arion’s self were in the car,"
18199,BOOK XXIII.,"Adrastus’ flying steed, of heav’nly race,"
18200,BOOK XXIII.,Nor those which here Laomedon possess’d.”
18201,BOOK XXIII.,
18202,BOOK XXIII.,"This said, and to his son his counsels giv’n,"
18203,BOOK XXIII.,The aged Nestor to his seat withdrew.
18204,BOOK XXIII.,Fifth in the lists Meriones appear’d.
18205,BOOK XXIII.,"They mounted on their cars, and cast their lots:"
18206,BOOK XXIII.,Achilles shook the helmet; first leaped forth
18207,BOOK XXIII.,"The lot of Nestor’s son, Antilochus;"
18208,BOOK XXIII.,Next came the King Eumelus; after whom
18209,BOOK XXIII.,"The valiant Menelaus, Atreus’ son;"
18210,BOOK XXIII.,"The fourth, Meriones; and last of all,"
18211,BOOK XXIII.,"But ablest far, Tydides drew his place."
18212,BOOK XXIII.,"They stood in line; Achilles pointed out,"
18213,BOOK XXIII.,"Ear on the level plain, the distant goal;"
18214,BOOK XXIII.,"And there in charge the godlike Phoenix plac’d,"
18215,BOOK XXIII.,"His father’s ancient follower, to observe"
18216,BOOK XXIII.,"The course assign’d, and true report to make."
18217,BOOK XXIII.,"Then all at once their whips they rais’d, and urg’d"
18218,BOOK XXIII.,"By rein, and hand, and voice, their eager steeds."
18219,BOOK XXIII.,They from the ships pursued their rapid course
18220,BOOK XXIII.,Athwart the distant plain; beneath their chests
18221,BOOK XXIII.,"Rose like a cloud, or hurricane, the dust;"
18222,BOOK XXIII.,Loose floated on the breeze their ample manes;
18223,BOOK XXIII.,"The cars now skimm’d along the fertile ground,"
18224,BOOK XXIII.,Now bounded high in air; the charioteers
18225,BOOK XXIII.,"Stood up aloft, and ev’ry bosom beat"
18226,BOOK XXIII.,With hope of vict’ry; each with eager shout
18227,BOOK XXIII.,"Cheering his steeds, that scour’d the dusty plain."
18228,BOOK XXIII.,"But when, the farthest limits of the course"
18229,BOOK XXIII.,"Attain’d, they turn’d beside the hoary sea,"
18230,BOOK XXIII.,"Strain’d to their utmost speed, were plainly seen"
18231,BOOK XXIII.,The qualities of each; then in the front
18232,BOOK XXIII.,"Appear’d Eumelus’ flying mares, and next"
18233,BOOK XXIII.,The Trojan horses of Tydides came:
18234,BOOK XXIII.,"Nor these were far behind, but following close"
18235,BOOK XXIII.,They seem’d in act to leap upon the car.
18236,BOOK XXIII.,"Eumelus, on his neck and shoulders broad,"
18237,BOOK XXIII.,"Felt their warm breath; for o’er him, as they flew,"
18238,BOOK XXIII.,"Their heads were downward bent; and now, perchance,"
18239,BOOK XXIII.,"Had he or pass’d, or made an even race,"
18240,BOOK XXIII.,"But that, incens’d with valiant Diomed,"
18241,BOOK XXIII.,Apollo wrested from his hands the whip.
18242,BOOK XXIII.,"Then tears of anger from his eyelids fell,"
18243,BOOK XXIII.,"As gaining more and more the mares he saw,"
18244,BOOK XXIII.,"While, urg’d no more, his horses slack’d their speed."
18245,BOOK XXIII.,But Pallas mark’d Apollo’s treach’rous wile;
18246,BOOK XXIII.,"And hasting to the chief, restor’d his whip,"
18247,BOOK XXIII.,And to his horses strength and courage gave.
18248,BOOK XXIII.,"The Goddess then Admetus’ son pursued,"
18249,BOOK XXIII.,"And snapp’d his chariot yoke; the mares, releas’d,"
18250,BOOK XXIII.,Swerv’d from the track; the pole upon the ground
18251,BOOK XXIII.,Lay loosen’d from the car; and he himself
18252,BOOK XXIII.,Beside the wheel was from the chariot hurl’d.
18253,BOOK XXIII.,"From elbows, mouth, and nose, the skin was torn;"
18254,BOOK XXIII.,His forehead crush’d and batter’d in; his eyes
18255,BOOK XXIII.,"Were fill’d with tears, and mute his cheerful voice."
18256,BOOK XXIII.,"Tydides turn’d aside, and far ahead"
18257,BOOK XXIII.,"Of all the rest, pass’d on; for Pallas gave"
18258,BOOK XXIII.,"His horses courage, and his triumph will’d."
18259,BOOK XXIII.,"Next him, the fair-hair’d Menelaus came,"
18260,BOOK XXIII.,The son of Atreus; but Antilochus
18261,BOOK XXIII.,Thus to his father’s horses call’d aloud:
18262,BOOK XXIII.,
18263,BOOK XXIII.,"“Forward, and stretch ye to your utmost speed;"
18264,BOOK XXIII.,I ask you not with those of Diomed
18265,BOOK XXIII.,"In vain to strive, whom Pallas hath endued"
18266,BOOK XXIII.,"With added swiftness, and his triumph will’d;"
18267,BOOK XXIII.,"But haste ye, and o’ertake Atrides’ car,"
18268,BOOK XXIII.,"Nor be by Æthe, by a mare, disgrac’d."
18269,BOOK XXIII.,"Why, my brave horses, why be left behind?"
18270,BOOK XXIII.,"This too I warn ye, and will make it good:"
18271,BOOK XXIII.,No more at Nestor’s hand shall ye receive
18272,BOOK XXIII.,"Your provender, but with the sword be slain,"
18273,BOOK XXIII.,If by your faults a lower prize be ours;
18274,BOOK XXIII.,"Then rouse ye now, and put forth all your speed,"
18275,BOOK XXIII.,"And I will so contrive, as not to fail"
18276,BOOK XXIII.,Of slipping past them in the narrow way.”
18277,BOOK XXIII.,
18278,BOOK XXIII.,"He said; the horses, of his voice in awe,"
18279,BOOK XXIII.,Put forth their pow’rs awhile; before them soon
18280,BOOK XXIII.,Antilochus the narrow pass espied.
18281,BOOK XXIII.,"It was a gully, where the winter’s rain"
18282,BOOK XXIII.,"Had lain collected, and had broken through"
18283,BOOK XXIII.,"A length of road, and hollow’d out the ground:"
18284,BOOK XXIII.,There Menelaus held his cautious course.
18285,BOOK XXIII.,"Fearing collision; but Antilochus,"
18286,BOOK XXIII.,"Drawing his steeds a little from the track,"
18287,BOOK XXIII.,"Bore down upon him sideways: then in fear,"
18288,BOOK XXIII.,The son of Atreus to Antilochus
18289,BOOK XXIII.,"Shouted aloud, “Antilochus, thou driv’st"
18290,BOOK XXIII.,Like one insane; hold in awhile thy steeds;
18291,BOOK XXIII.,"Here is no space; where wider grows the road,"
18292,BOOK XXIII.,"There thou mayst pass; but here, thou wilt but cause"
18293,BOOK XXIII.,"Our cars to clash, and bring us both to harm.”"
18294,BOOK XXIII.,
18295,BOOK XXIII.,"He said; but madlier drove Antilochus,"
18296,BOOK XXIII.,"Plying the goad, as though he heard him not."
18297,BOOK XXIII.,
18298,BOOK XXIII.,"Far as a discus’ flight, by some stout youth,"
18299,BOOK XXIII.,"That tests his vigour, from the shoulder hurl’d,"
18300,BOOK XXIII.,"So far they ran together, side by side:"
18301,BOOK XXIII.,"Then dropp’d Atrides’ horses to the rear,"
18302,BOOK XXIII.,"For he himself forbore to urge their speed,"
18303,BOOK XXIII.,"Lest, meeting in the narrow pass, the cars"
18304,BOOK XXIII.,"Should be o’erthrown, and they themselves, in haste"
18305,BOOK XXIII.,"To gain the vict’ry, in the dust be roll’d."
18306,BOOK XXIII.,"Then thus, reproachful, to Antilochus:"
18307,BOOK XXIII.,
18308,BOOK XXIII.,"“Antilochus, thou most perverse of men!"
18309,BOOK XXIII.,Beshrew thy heart! we Greeks are much deceiv’d
18310,BOOK XXIII.,Who give thee fame for wisdom! yet e’en now
18311,BOOK XXIII.,"Thou shalt not gain, but on thine oath, the prize.”"
18312,BOOK XXIII.,
18313,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and to his horses call’d aloud:"
18314,BOOK XXIII.,"“Slack not your speed, nor, as defeated, mourn;"
18315,BOOK XXIII.,"Their legs and feet will sooner tire than yours,"
18316,BOOK XXIII.,For both are past the vigour of their youth.”
18317,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus he; the horses, of his voice in awe,"
18318,BOOK XXIII.,"Put forth their pow’rs, and soon the leaders near’d."
18319,BOOK XXIII.,
18320,BOOK XXIII.,"Meanwhile the chieftains, seated in the ring,"
18321,BOOK XXIII.,"Look’d for the cars, that scour’d the dusty plain."
18322,BOOK XXIII.,"The first to see them was Idomeneus,"
18323,BOOK XXIII.,"The Cretan King; for he, without the ring,"
18324,BOOK XXIII.,Was posted high aloft; and from afar
18325,BOOK XXIII.,He heard and knew the foremost horseman’s voice;
18326,BOOK XXIII.,"Well too he knew the gallant horse that led,"
18327,BOOK XXIII.,"All bay the rest, but on his front alone"
18328,BOOK XXIII.,"A star of white, full-orbed as the moon:"
18329,BOOK XXIII.,"Then up he rose, and thus the Greeks address’d:"
18330,BOOK XXIII.,
18331,BOOK XXIII.,"“O friends, the chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
18332,BOOK XXIII.,"Can ye too see, or I alone, the cars?"
18333,BOOK XXIII.,"A diff’rent chariot seems to me in front,"
18334,BOOK XXIII.,A diff’rent charioteer; and they who first
18335,BOOK XXIII.,"Were leading, must have met with some mischance."
18336,BOOK XXIII.,"I saw them late, ere round the goal they turn’d,"
18337,BOOK XXIII.,But see them now no more; though all around
18338,BOOK XXIII.,My eyes explore the wide-spread plain of Troy.
18339,BOOK XXIII.,"Perchance the charioteer has dropp’d the reins,"
18340,BOOK XXIII.,Or round the goal he could not hold the mares;
18341,BOOK XXIII.,"Perchance has miss’d the turn, and on the plain"
18342,BOOK XXIII.,"Is lying now beside his broken car,"
18343,BOOK XXIII.,While from the course his mettled steeds have flown.
18344,BOOK XXIII.,"Stand up, and look yourselves; I cannot well"
18345,BOOK XXIII.,"Distinguish; but to me it seems a chief,"
18346,BOOK XXIII.,"Who reigns o’er Greeks, though of Ætolian race,"
18347,BOOK XXIII.,"The son of Tydeus, valiant Diomed.”"
18348,BOOK XXIII.,
18349,BOOK XXIII.,Sharply Oileus’ active son replied:
18350,BOOK XXIII.,"“Idomeneus, why thus, before the time,"
18351,BOOK XXIII.,So rashly speak? while the high-stepping steeds
18352,BOOK XXIII.,Are speeding yet across the distant plain.
18353,BOOK XXIII.,"Thine eyes are not the youngest in the camp,"
18354,BOOK XXIII.,Nor look they out the sharpest from thy head;
18355,BOOK XXIII.,"But thou art ever hasty in thy speech,"
18356,BOOK XXIII.,And ill becomes thee this precipitance.
18357,BOOK XXIII.,"Since others are there here, thy betters far."
18358,BOOK XXIII.,"The same are leading now, that led at first,"
18359,BOOK XXIII.,Eumelus’ mares; ’tis he that holds the reins.”
18360,BOOK XXIII.,
18361,BOOK XXIII.,To whom in anger thus the Cretan chief:
18362,BOOK XXIII.,"“Ajax, at wrangling good, in judgment naught,"
18363,BOOK XXIII.,"And for aught else, among the chiefs of Greece"
18364,BOOK XXIII.,Of small account—so stubborn is thy soul;
18365,BOOK XXIII.,"Wilt thou a tripod or a caldron stake,"
18366,BOOK XXIII.,"And Agamemnon, Atreus’ son, appoint"
18367,BOOK XXIII.,The umpire to decide whose steeds are first?
18368,BOOK XXIII.,So shalt thou gain thy knowledge at thy cost.”
18369,BOOK XXIII.,
18370,BOOK XXIII.,"He said; up sprang Oileus’ active son,"
18371,BOOK XXIII.,In anger to reply; and farther yet
18372,BOOK XXIII.,"Had gone the quarrel, but Achilles’ self"
18373,BOOK XXIII.,"Stood up, and thus the rival chiefs address’d:"
18374,BOOK XXIII.,
18375,BOOK XXIII.,"“Forbear, both Ajax and Idomeneus,"
18376,BOOK XXIII.,This bitter interchange of wordy war;
18377,BOOK XXIII.,"It is not seemly; and yourselves, I know,"
18378,BOOK XXIII.,"Another would condemn, who so should speak."
18379,BOOK XXIII.,"But stay ye here, and seated in the ring,"
18380,BOOK XXIII.,"Their coming wait; they, hurrying to the goal,"
18381,BOOK XXIII.,Will soon be here; and then shall each man know
18382,BOOK XXIII.,"Whose horses are the second, whose the first.”"
18383,BOOK XXIII.,
18384,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus he; but Tydeus’ son drew near, his lash"
18385,BOOK XXIII.,Still laid upon his horses’ shoulder-points;
18386,BOOK XXIII.,"As lightly they, high-stepping, scour’d the plain."
18387,BOOK XXIII.,Still on the charioteer the dust was flung;
18388,BOOK XXIII.,As close upon the flying-footed steeds
18389,BOOK XXIII.,Follow’d the car with gold and tin inlaid;
18390,BOOK XXIII.,"And lightly, as they flew along, were left"
18391,BOOK XXIII.,Impress’d the wheel-tracks on the sandy plain.
18392,BOOK XXIII.,"There in the midst he stood, the sweat profuse"
18393,BOOK XXIII.,Down-pouring from his horses’ heads and chests;
18394,BOOK XXIII.,"Down from the glitt’ring car he leap’d to earth,"
18395,BOOK XXIII.,And lean’d his whip against the chariot yoke;
18396,BOOK XXIII.,"Nor long delay’d the valiant Sthenelus,"
18397,BOOK XXIII.,But eagerly sprang forth to claim the prize;
18398,BOOK XXIII.,Then to his brave companions gave in charge
18399,BOOK XXIII.,"To lead away the woman, and to bear"
18400,BOOK XXIII.,"The tripod, while himself unyok’d the steeds."
18401,BOOK XXIII.,
18402,BOOK XXIII.,"Nest came the horses of Antilochus,"
18403,BOOK XXIII.,"Who had by stratagem, and not by speed,"
18404,BOOK XXIII.,O’er Menelaus triumph’d; yet e’en so
18405,BOOK XXIII.,Atrides’ flying coursers press’d him hard;
18406,BOOK XXIII.,For but so far as from the chariot-wheel
18407,BOOK XXIII.,"A horse, when harness’d to a royal car;"
18408,BOOK XXIII.,"Whose tail, back-streaming, with the utmost hairs"
18409,BOOK XXIII.,"Brushes the felloes; close before the wheel,"
18410,BOOK XXIII.,"Small space between, he scours the wide-spread plain:"
18411,BOOK XXIII.,So far was Menelaus in the rear
18412,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Nestor’s son; at first, a discus’ cast"
18413,BOOK XXIII.,Between them lay; but rapidly his ground
18414,BOOK XXIII.,He gain’d—so well the speed and courage serv’d
18415,BOOK XXIII.,"Of Æthe, Agamemnon’s beauteous mare;"
18416,BOOK XXIII.,"And, but a little farther were the course,"
18417,BOOK XXIII.,"Had pass’d him by, nor left the race in doubt."
18418,BOOK XXIII.,"Behind the noble son of Atreus came,"
18419,BOOK XXIII.,"A jav’lin’s flight apart, Meriones,"
18420,BOOK XXIII.,The faithful follower of Idomeneus:
18421,BOOK XXIII.,"His were the slowest horses, and himself"
18422,BOOK XXIII.,The least experienc’d in the rapid race.
18423,BOOK XXIII.,"Dragging his broken car, came last of all,"
18424,BOOK XXIII.,"His horses driv’n in front, Admetus’ son;"
18425,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles swift of foot with pity saw,"
18426,BOOK XXIII.,And to the Greeks his winged words address’d:
18427,BOOK XXIII.,
18428,BOOK XXIII.,“See where the best of all the last appears;
18429,BOOK XXIII.,"But let him take, as meet, the second prize;"
18430,BOOK XXIII.,The first belongs of right to Tydeus’ son.”
18431,BOOK XXIII.,
18432,BOOK XXIII.,Thus he; they all assented to his words;
18433,BOOK XXIII.,"And, by the gen’ral voice of Greece, the mare"
18434,BOOK XXIII.,"Had now been his; but noble Nestor’s son,"
18435,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus, stood up, his right to claim,"
18436,BOOK XXIII.,"And to Achilles, Peleus’ son, replied:"
18437,BOOK XXIII.,"“Achilles, thou wilt do me grievous wrong,"
18438,BOOK XXIII.,If thou thy words accomplish; for my prize
18439,BOOK XXIII.,"Thou tak’st away, because mishap befell"
18440,BOOK XXIII.,"His car and horses, by no fault of his;"
18441,BOOK XXIII.,"Yet had he to th’ Immortals made his pray’r,"
18442,BOOK XXIII.,He surely had not thus been last of all.
18443,BOOK XXIII.,"But, pitying him, if so thy mind incline,"
18444,BOOK XXIII.,"Thy tents contain good store of gold, and brass,"
18445,BOOK XXIII.,"And sheep, and female slaves, and noble steeds;"
18446,BOOK XXIII.,"For him, of these, hereafter mayst thou take"
18447,BOOK XXIII.,"A prize of higher value; or e’en now,"
18448,BOOK XXIII.,"And with th’ applause of all; but for the mare,"
18449,BOOK XXIII.,I will not give her up; and let who will
18450,BOOK XXIII.,"Stand forth, my own right hand shall guard my prize.”"
18451,BOOK XXIII.,
18452,BOOK XXIII.,"He said; and smil’d Achilles swift of foot,"
18453,BOOK XXIII.,"Delighted; for he lov’d the noble youth,"
18454,BOOK XXIII.,To whom his winged words he thus address’d:
18455,BOOK XXIII.,
18456,BOOK XXIII.,"“Antilochus, if such be thy request,"
18457,BOOK XXIII.,"That for Eumelus I should add a prize,"
18458,BOOK XXIII.,This too I grant thee; and to him I give
18459,BOOK XXIII.,"My breastplate, from Asteropaeus won,"
18460,BOOK XXIII.,"Of brass, around whose edge is roll’d a stream"
18461,BOOK XXIII.,Of shining tin; a gift of goodly price.”
18462,BOOK XXIII.,
18463,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and bade Automedon, his friend"
18464,BOOK XXIII.,"And comrade, bring the breastplate from his tent;"
18465,BOOK XXIII.,"He went, and brought it; in Eumelus’ hand"
18466,BOOK XXIII.,He plac’d it; he with joy the gift receiv’d.
18467,BOOK XXIII.,"Then Menelaus, sad at heart, arose,"
18468,BOOK XXIII.,Burning with wrath against Antilochus;
18469,BOOK XXIII.,And while the herald in the monarch’s hand
18470,BOOK XXIII.,"His royal sceptre plac’d, and bade the Greeks"
18471,BOOK XXIII.,"Keep silence, thus the godlike hero spoke:"
18472,BOOK XXIII.,
18473,BOOK XXIII.,"“Antilochus, till now reputed wise,"
18474,BOOK XXIII.,"What hast thou done? thou hast impugn’d my skill,"
18475,BOOK XXIII.,"And sham’d my horses, who hast brought thine own,"
18476,BOOK XXIII.,"Inferior far, before them to the goal."
18477,BOOK XXIII.,"But come, ye chiefs and councillors of Greece,"
18478,BOOK XXIII.,"Judge ye between us, fav’ring neither side:"
18479,BOOK XXIII.,That none of all the brass-clad Greeks may say
18480,BOOK XXIII.,That Menelaus hath by false reports
18481,BOOK XXIII.,"O’erborne Antilochus, and holds his prize:"
18482,BOOK XXIII.,"His horses fairly worsted, and himself"
18483,BOOK XXIII.,Triumphant only by superior pow’r.
18484,BOOK XXIII.,"Or come now, I myself will judgment give;"
18485,BOOK XXIII.,Nor deem I any Greek will find to blame
18486,BOOK XXIII.,"In my decision, for ’tis fair and just."
18487,BOOK XXIII.,"Antilochus, come forward, noble chief;"
18488,BOOK XXIII.,"And standing, as ’tis meet, before the car"
18489,BOOK XXIII.,"And horses, in thy hand the slender whip"
18490,BOOK XXIII.,"Wherewith thou drov’st, upon the horses lay"
18491,BOOK XXIII.,"Thy hand, and by Earth-shaking Neptune swear"
18492,BOOK XXIII.,"That not of malice, and by set design,"
18493,BOOK XXIII.,Thou didst by fraud impede my chariot’s course.”
18494,BOOK XXIII.,
18495,BOOK XXIII.,To whom Antilochus with prudent speech:
18496,BOOK XXIII.,"“Have patience with me yet; for I, O King,"
18497,BOOK XXIII.,"O Menelaus, am thy junior far;"
18498,BOOK XXIII.,My elder and superior thee I own.
18499,BOOK XXIII.,"Thou know’st th’ o’er-eager vehemence of youth,"
18500,BOOK XXIII.,"How quick in temper, and in judgment weak."
18501,BOOK XXIII.,Set then thy heart at ease; the mare I won
18502,BOOK XXIII.,I freely give; and if aught else of mine
18503,BOOK XXIII.,"Thou shouldst desire, would sooner give it all,"
18504,BOOK XXIII.,"Than all my life be low’r’d, illustrious King,"
18505,BOOK XXIII.,"In thine esteem, and sin against the Gods.”"
18506,BOOK XXIII.,
18507,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus saying, noble Nestor’s son led forth,"
18508,BOOK XXIII.,And plac’d in Menelaus’ hands the mare:
18509,BOOK XXIII.,"The monarch’s soul was melted, like the dew"
18510,BOOK XXIII.,"Which glitters on the ears of growing corn,"
18511,BOOK XXIII.,"That bristle o’er the plain; e’en so thy soul,"
18512,BOOK XXIII.,"O Menelaus, melted at his speech;"
18513,BOOK XXIII.,To whom were thus address’d thy winged words:
18514,BOOK XXIII.,
18515,BOOK XXIII.,"“Antilochus, at once I lay aside"
18516,BOOK XXIII.,"My anger; thou art prudent, and not apt"
18517,BOOK XXIII.,To be thus led astray; but now thy youth
18518,BOOK XXIII.,Thy judgment hath o’erpow’r’d; seek not henceforth
18519,BOOK XXIII.,By trick’ry o’er thine elders to prevail.
18520,BOOK XXIII.,To any other man of all the Greeks
18521,BOOK XXIII.,I scarce so much had yielded; but for that
18522,BOOK XXIII.,"Thyself hast labour’d much, and much endur’d,"
18523,BOOK XXIII.,"Thou, thy good sire, and brother, in my cause:"
18524,BOOK XXIII.,"I yield me to thy pray’rs; and give, to boot,"
18525,BOOK XXIII.,"The mare, though mine of right; that these may know"
18526,BOOK XXIII.,"I am not of a harsh, unyielding mood.”"
18527,BOOK XXIII.,
18528,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and to Noemon gave in charge,"
18529,BOOK XXIII.,"The faithful comrade of Antilochus,"
18530,BOOK XXIII.,The mare; himself the glitt’ring caldron took.
18531,BOOK XXIII.,"Of gold two talents, to the fourth assign’d,"
18532,BOOK XXIII.,"Fourth in the race, Meriones receiv’d;"
18533,BOOK XXIII.,"Still the fifth prize, a vase with double cup,"
18534,BOOK XXIII.,"Remain’d; Achilles this to Nestor gave,"
18535,BOOK XXIII.,"Before th’ assembled Greeks, as thus he spoke:"
18536,BOOK XXIII.,
18537,BOOK XXIII.,"“Take this, old man, and for an heirloom keep,"
18538,BOOK XXIII.,"In mem’ry of Patroclus’ fun’ral games,"
18539,BOOK XXIII.,Whom thou no more amid the Greeks shalt see.
18540,BOOK XXIII.,Freely I give it thee; for thou no more
18541,BOOK XXIII.,"Canst box, or wrestle, or in sportive strife"
18542,BOOK XXIII.,"The jav’lin throw, or race with flying feet;"
18543,BOOK XXIII.,For age with heavy hand hath bow’d thee down.”
18544,BOOK XXIII.,
18545,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and plac’d it in his hand; th’ old man"
18546,BOOK XXIII.,"Beceiv’d with joy the gift, and thus replied:"
18547,BOOK XXIII.,
18548,BOOK XXIII.,"“All thou hast said, my son, is simple truth:"
18549,BOOK XXIII.,"No firmness now my limbs and feet retain,"
18550,BOOK XXIII.,"Nor can my arms with freedom, as of old,"
18551,BOOK XXIII.,"Straight from the shoulder, right and left, strike out."
18552,BOOK XXIII.,"Oh that such youth and vigour yet were mine,"
18553,BOOK XXIII.,As when th’ Epeians in Buprasium held
18554,BOOK XXIII.,"The royal Amarynceus’ fun’ral games,"
18555,BOOK XXIII.,And when the monarch’s sons his prizes gave!
18556,BOOK XXIII.,"Then could not one of all th’ Epeian race,"
18557,BOOK XXIII.,"Or Pylians, or Ætolians, vie with me."
18558,BOOK XXIII.,"In boxing, Clytomedes, Œnops’ son,"
18559,BOOK XXIII.,"I vanquished; then Anchaeus, who stood up"
18560,BOOK XXIII.,"To wrestle with me, I with ease o’erthrew;"
18561,BOOK XXIII.,"Iphiclus I outran, though fleet of foot;"
18562,BOOK XXIII.,"In hurling with the spear, with Phyleus strove,"
18563,BOOK XXIII.,"And Polydorus, and surpass’d them both."
18564,BOOK XXIII.,The sons of Actor in the chariot-race
18565,BOOK XXIII.,"Alone o’ercame me; as in number more,[8]"
18566,BOOK XXIII.,"And grudging more my triumph, since remain’d,"
18567,BOOK XXIII.,"This contest to reward, the richest prize."
18568,BOOK XXIII.,"They were twin brothers; one who held the reins,"
18569,BOOK XXIII.,"Still drove, and drove; the other plied the whip."
18570,BOOK XXIII.,Such was I once; but now must younger men
18571,BOOK XXIII.,"Engage in deeds like these; and I, the chief"
18572,BOOK XXIII.,"Of heroes once, must bow to weary age."
18573,BOOK XXIII.,But honour thou with fitting fun’ral games
18574,BOOK XXIII.,"Thy comrade: I accept, well-pleas’d, thy gift,"
18575,BOOK XXIII.,My heart rejoicing that thou still retain’st
18576,BOOK XXIII.,"Of me a kindly mem’ry, nor o’erlook’st"
18577,BOOK XXIII.,"The place of honour, which among the Greeks"
18578,BOOK XXIII.,"Belongs to me of right; for this, the Gods"
18579,BOOK XXIII.,Reward thee with a worthy recompense!”
18580,BOOK XXIII.,
18581,BOOK XXIII.,He said; Achilles listen’d to the praise
18582,BOOK XXIII.,Of Neleus’ son; then join’d the gen’ral throng.
18583,BOOK XXIII.,"Next, he set forth the prizes, to reward"
18584,BOOK XXIII.,The labours of the sturdy pugilists;
18585,BOOK XXIII.,"A hardy mule he tether’d in the ring,"
18586,BOOK XXIII.,"Unbroken, six years old, most hard to tame;"
18587,BOOK XXIII.,"And for the vanquished man, a double cup;"
18588,BOOK XXIII.,"Then rose, and to the Greeks proclaim’d aloud:"
18589,BOOK XXIII.,
18590,BOOK XXIII.,"“Thou son of Atreus, and ye well-greav’d Greeks,"
18591,BOOK XXIII.,For these we bid two champions brave stand forth.
18592,BOOK XXIII.,And in the boxer’s manly toil contend;
18593,BOOK XXIII.,"And he, whose stern endurance Phoebus crowns"
18594,BOOK XXIII.,"With vict’ry, recogniz’d by all the Greeks,"
18595,BOOK XXIII.,He to his tent shall lead the hardy mule;
18596,BOOK XXIII.,The loser shall the double cup receive.”
18597,BOOK XXIII.,
18598,BOOK XXIII.,"He said; up sprang Epeius, tall and stout,"
18599,BOOK XXIII.,"A boxer skill’d, the son of Panopeus,"
18600,BOOK XXIII.,"Who laid his hand upon the mule, and said:"
18601,BOOK XXIII.,
18602,BOOK XXIII.,"“Stand forth, if any care the cup to win;"
18603,BOOK XXIII.,"The mule, methinks, no Greek can bear away"
18604,BOOK XXIII.,"From me, who glory in the champion’s name."
18605,BOOK XXIII.,"Is’t not enough, that in the battle-field"
18606,BOOK XXIII.,I claim no special praise? ’tis not for man
18607,BOOK XXIII.,"In all things to excel; but this I say,"
18608,BOOK XXIII.,"And will make good my words, who meets me here,"
18609,BOOK XXIII.,"I mean to pound his flesh, and smash his bones."
18610,BOOK XXIII.,"See that his seconds be at hand, and prompt"
18611,BOOK XXIII.,"To bear him from the ring, by me subdued.”"
18612,BOOK XXIII.,
18613,BOOK XXIII.,He said; they all in silence heard his speech:
18614,BOOK XXIII.,"Only Euryalus, a godlike chief,"
18615,BOOK XXIII.,"Son of Mecistheus, Talaion’s son,"
18616,BOOK XXIII.,Stood forth opposing; he had once in Thebes
18617,BOOK XXIII.,"Join’d in the fun’ral games of Œdipus,"
18618,BOOK XXIII.,And there had vanquish’d all of Cadmian race.
18619,BOOK XXIII.,"On him attended valiant Diomed,"
18620,BOOK XXIII.,"With cheering words, and wishes of success."
18621,BOOK XXIII.,"Around his waist he fasten’d first the belt,"
18622,BOOK XXIII.,Then gave the well-cut gauntlets for his hands.
18623,BOOK XXIII.,"Of wild bull’s hide. When both were thus equipp’d,"
18624,BOOK XXIII.,Into the centre of the ring they stepp’d:
18625,BOOK XXIII.,"There, face to face, with sinewy arms uprais’d,"
18626,BOOK XXIII.,"They stood awhile, then clos’d; strong hand with hand"
18627,BOOK XXIII.,"Mingling, in rapid interchange of blows."
18628,BOOK XXIII.,Dire was the clatter of their jaws; the sweat
18629,BOOK XXIII.,"Pour’d forth, profuse, from ev’ry limb; then rush’d"
18630,BOOK XXIII.,"Epeius on, and full upon the cheek,"
18631,BOOK XXIII.,"Half turn’d aside, let fall a stagg’ring blow;"
18632,BOOK XXIII.,"Nor stood Euryalus; but, legs and feet"
18633,BOOK XXIII.,"Knock’d from beneath him, prone to earth he fell;"
18634,BOOK XXIII.,"And as a fish, that flounders on the sand,"
18635,BOOK XXIII.,"Thrown by rude Boreas on the weedy beach,"
18636,BOOK XXIII.,Till cover’d o’er by the returning wave;
18637,BOOK XXIII.,So flounder’d he beneath that stunning blow.
18638,BOOK XXIII.,"But brave Epeius took him by the hand,"
18639,BOOK XXIII.,And rais’d him up; his comrades crowded round
18640,BOOK XXIII.,"And bore him from the field, with dragging steps,"
18641,BOOK XXIII.,"Spitting forth clotted gore, his heavy head"
18642,BOOK XXIII.,Rolling from side to side; within his tent
18643,BOOK XXIII.,"They laid him down, unconscious; to the ring"
18644,BOOK XXIII.,"Then back returning, bore away the cup."
18645,BOOK XXIII.,
18646,BOOK XXIII.,Achilles next before the Greeks display’d
18647,BOOK XXIII.,The prizes of the hardy wrestlers’ skill:
18648,BOOK XXIII.,"The victor’s prize, a tripod vast, fire-proof,"
18649,BOOK XXIII.,And at twelve oxen by the Greeks apprais’d;
18650,BOOK XXIII.,"And for the vanquish’d man, a female slave"
18651,BOOK XXIII.,"Pric’d at four oxen, skill’d in household work."
18652,BOOK XXIII.,"Then rose, and loudly to the Greeks proclaim’d,"
18653,BOOK XXIII.,"“Stand forth, whoe’er this contest will essay.”"
18654,BOOK XXIII.,
18655,BOOK XXIII.,He said; and straight uprose the giant form
18656,BOOK XXIII.,Of Ajax Telamon; with him uprose
18657,BOOK XXIII.,"Ulysses, skill’d in ev’ry crafty wile."
18658,BOOK XXIII.,"Girt with the belt, within the ring they stood,"
18659,BOOK XXIII.,"And each, with stalwart grasp, laid hold on each;"
18660,BOOK XXIII.,"As stand two rafters of a lofty house,"
18661,BOOK XXIII.,"Each propping each, by skilful architect"
18662,BOOK XXIII.,Design’d the tempest’s fury to withstand.
18663,BOOK XXIII.,Creak’d their backbones beneath the tug and strain
18664,BOOK XXIII.,Of those strong arms; their sweat pour’d down like rain;
18665,BOOK XXIII.,And bloody weals of livid purple hue
18666,BOOK XXIII.,"Their sides and shoulders streak’d, as sternly they"
18667,BOOK XXIII.,For vict’ry and the well-wrought tripod strove.
18668,BOOK XXIII.,"Nor could Ulysses Ajax overthrow,"
18669,BOOK XXIII.,"Nor Ajax bring Ulysses to the ground,"
18670,BOOK XXIII.,So stubbornly he stood; but when the Greeks
18671,BOOK XXIII.,"Were weary of the long-protracted strife,"
18672,BOOK XXIII.,Thus to Ulysses mighty Ajax spoke:
18673,BOOK XXIII.,"“Ulysses sage, Laertes’ godlike son,"
18674,BOOK XXIII.,"Or lift thou me, or I will thee uplift:"
18675,BOOK XXIII.,The issue of our struggle rests with Jove.”
18676,BOOK XXIII.,
18677,BOOK XXIII.,"He said, and rais’d Ulysses from the ground;"
18678,BOOK XXIII.,"Nor he his ancient craft remember’d not,"
18679,BOOK XXIII.,"But lock’d his leg around, and striking sharp"
18680,BOOK XXIII.,"Upon the hollow of the knee, the joint"
18681,BOOK XXIII.,"Gave way; the giant Ajax backwards fell,"
18682,BOOK XXIII.,"Ulysses on his breast; the people saw,"
18683,BOOK XXIII.,And marvell’d. Then in turn Ulysses strove
18684,BOOK XXIII.,"Ajax to lift; a little way he mov’d,"
18685,BOOK XXIII.,"But fail’d to lift him fairly from, the ground;"
18686,BOOK XXIII.,"Yet crook’d his knee, that both together fell,"
18687,BOOK XXIII.,"And side by side, defil’d with dust, they lay."
18688,BOOK XXIII.,
18689,BOOK XXIII.,And now a third encounter had they tried
18690,BOOK XXIII.,"But rose Achilles, and the combat stay’d:"
18691,BOOK XXIII.,
18692,BOOK XXIII.,"“Forbear, nor waste your strength, in farther strife;"
18693,BOOK XXIII.,Ye both are victors; both then bear away
18694,BOOK XXIII.,"An equal meed of honour; and withdraw,"
18695,BOOK XXIII.,That other Greeks may other contests wage.”
18696,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus spoke Achilles: they his words obey’d,"
18697,BOOK XXIII.,"And brushing off the dust, their garments donn’d."
18698,BOOK XXIII.,
18699,BOOK XXIII.,"The prizes of the runners, swift of foot,"
18700,BOOK XXIII.,"Achilles next set forth; a silver bowl,"
18701,BOOK XXIII.,"Six measures its content, for workmanship"
18702,BOOK XXIII.,"Unmatch’d on earth, of Sidon’s costliest art"
18703,BOOK XXIII.,The product rare; thence o’er the misty sea
18704,BOOK XXIII.,"Brought by Phoenicians, who, in port arriv’d,"
18705,BOOK XXIII.,"Gave it to Thoas; by Euneus last,"
18706,BOOK XXIII.,"The son of Jason, to Patroclus paid,"
18707,BOOK XXIII.,"In ransom of Lycaon, Priam’s son;"
18708,BOOK XXIII.,"Which now Achilles, on his friend’s behalf,"
18709,BOOK XXIII.,"Assign’d as his reward, whoe’er should prove"
18710,BOOK XXIII.,"The lightest foot, and speediest in the race."
18711,BOOK XXIII.,"A steer, well fatten’d, was the second prize,"
18712,BOOK XXIII.,"And half a talent, for the third, of gold."
18713,BOOK XXIII.,"He rose, and to the Greeks proclaim’d aloud,"
18714,BOOK XXIII.,"“Stand forth, whoe’er this contest will essay.”"
18715,BOOK XXIII.,He said: uprose Oileus’ active son;
18716,BOOK XXIII.,"Uprose Ulysses, skill’d in ev’ry wile,"
18717,BOOK XXIII.,"And noble Nestor’s son, Antilochus,"
18718,BOOK XXIII.,Who all the youth in speed of foot surpass’d.
18719,BOOK XXIII.,They stood in line: Achilles pointed out
18720,BOOK XXIII.,The limits of the course; as from the goal
18721,BOOK XXIII.,"They stretch’d them to the race, Oileus’ son"
18722,BOOK XXIII.,First shot ahead; Ulysses following close;
18723,BOOK XXIII.,Nor farther than the shuttle from the breast
18724,BOOK XXIII.,"Of some fair woman, when her outstretch’d arm"
18725,BOOK XXIII.,"Has thrown the woof athwart the warp, and back"
18726,BOOK XXIII.,Withdraws it tow’rd her breast; so close behind
18727,BOOK XXIII.,"Ulysses press’d on Ajax, and his feet"
18728,BOOK XXIII.,"Trod in his steps, ere settled yet the dust."
18729,BOOK XXIII.,"His breath was on his shoulders, as the plain"
18730,BOOK XXIII.,He lightly skimm’d; the Greeks with eager shouts
18731,BOOK XXIII.,"Still cheering, as he strain’d to win the prize."
18732,BOOK XXIII.,"But as they near’d the goal, Ulysses thus"
18733,BOOK XXIII.,To blue-ey’d Pallas made his mental pray’r:
18734,BOOK XXIII.,"“Now hear me, Goddess, and my feet befriend.”"
18735,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus as he pray’d, his pray’r the Goddess heard,"
18736,BOOK XXIII.,And all his limbs with active vigour fill’d;
18737,BOOK XXIII.,"And, as they stretch’d their hands to seize the prize,"
18738,BOOK XXIII.,"Tripp’d up by Pallas, Ajax slipp’d and fell,"
18739,BOOK XXIII.,Amid the offal of the lowing kine
18740,BOOK XXIII.,Which o’er Patroclus Peleus’ son had slain.
18741,BOOK XXIII.,His mouth and nostrils were with offal fill’d.
18742,BOOK XXIII.,"First in the race, Ulysses bore away"
18743,BOOK XXIII.,The silver bowl; the steer to Ajax fell;
18744,BOOK XXIII.,"And as upon the horn he laid his hand,"
18745,BOOK XXIII.,"Sputt’ring the offal out, he call’d aloud:"
18746,BOOK XXIII.,"“Lo, how the Goddess has my steps bewray’d,"
18747,BOOK XXIII.,Who guards Ulysses with a mother’s care.”
18748,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus as he spoke, loud laugh’d the merry Greeks."
18749,BOOK XXIII.,Antilochus the sole remaining prize
18750,BOOK XXIII.,"Receiv’d, and, laughing, thus the Greeks address’d:"
18751,BOOK XXIII.,
18752,BOOK XXIII.,"“I tell you, friends, but what yourselves do know,"
18753,BOOK XXIII.,How of the elder men th’ immortal Gods
18754,BOOK XXIII.,Take special care; for Ajax’ years not much
18755,BOOK XXIII.,"Exceed mine own; but here we see a man,"
18756,BOOK XXIII.,"One of a former age, and race of men;"
18757,BOOK XXIII.,A hale old man we call him; but for speed
18758,BOOK XXIII.,"Not one can match him, save Achilles’ self.”"
18759,BOOK XXIII.,
18760,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus he, with praise implied of Peleus’ son;"
18761,BOOK XXIII.,To whom in answer thus Achilles spoke:
18762,BOOK XXIII.,
18763,BOOK XXIII.,"“Antilochus, not unobserv’d of me"
18764,BOOK XXIII.,Nor unrewarded shall thy praise remain:
18765,BOOK XXIII.,To thy half talent add this second half.”
18766,BOOK XXIII.,
18767,BOOK XXIII.,"Thus saying, in his hand he plac’d the gold;"
18768,BOOK XXIII.,Antilochus with joy the gift receiv’d.
18769,BOOK XXIII.,
18770,BOOK XXIII.,"Next, in the ring the son of Peleus laid"
18771,BOOK XXIII.,"A pond’rous spear, a helmet, and a shield,"
18772,BOOK XXIII.,The spoil Patroclus from Sarpedon won;
18773,BOOK XXIII.,"Then rose, and loudly to the Greeks proclaim’d:"
18774,BOOK XXIII.,
18775,BOOK XXIII.,“For these we call upon two champions brave
18776,BOOK XXIII.,"To don their arms, their sharp-edg’d weapons grasp,"
18777,BOOK XXIII.,And public trial of their prowess make;
18778,BOOK XXIII.,"And he who first his rival’s flesh shall reach,"
18779,BOOK XXIII.,"And, through his armour piercing, first draw blood,"
18780,BOOK XXIII.,"He shall this silver-studded sword receive,"
18781,BOOK XXIII.,"My trophy from Asteropaeus won,"
18782,BOOK XXIII.,"Well-wrought, of Thracian metal; but the arms"
18783,BOOK XXIII.,"In common property they both shall hold,"
18784,BOOK XXIII.,And in my tent a noble banquet share.”
18785,BOOK XXIII.,
18786,BOOK XXIII.,"He said; uprose great Ajax Telamon,"
18787,BOOK XXIII.,"And Tydeus’ son, the valiant Diomed."
18788,BOOK XXIII.,"First, from the crowd apart, they donn’d their arms;"
18789,BOOK XXIII.,"Then, eager for the fight, with haughty stare"
18790,BOOK XXIII.,Stood in the midst; the Greeks admiring gaz’d.
18791,BOOK XXIII.,"When, each approaching other, near they came,"
18792,BOOK XXIII.,"Thrice rush’d they on, and thrice in combat clos’d."
18793,BOOK XXIII.,Then through the buckler round of Diomed
18794,BOOK XXIII.,Great Ajax drove his spear; nor reach’d the point
18795,BOOK XXIII.,"Tydides’ body, by the breastplate stay’d:"
18796,BOOK XXIII.,"While, aim’d above the mighty shield’s defence,"
18797,BOOK XXIII.,His glitt’ring weapon flash’d at Ajax’ throat.
18798,BOOK XXIII.,"For Ajax fearing, shouted then the Greeks"
18799,BOOK XXIII.,"To cease the fight, and share alike the prize;"
18800,BOOK XXIII.,"But from Achilles’ hand the mighty sword,"
18801,BOOK XXIII.,"With belt and scabbard, Diomed receiv’d."
18802,BOOK XXIII.,
18803,BOOK XXIII.,Next in the ring the son of Peleus plac’d
18804,BOOK XXIII.,"A pond’rous mass of iron, as a quoit"
18805,BOOK XXIII.,"Once wielded by Eetion’s giant strength,"
18806,BOOK XXIII.,"But to the ships with other trophies borne,"
18807,BOOK XXIII.,When by Achilles’ hand Eetion fell.
18808,BOOK XXIII.,"Then rose, and loudly to the Greeks proclaim’d:"
18809,BOOK XXIII.,"“Stand forth, whoe’er this contest will essay."
18810,BOOK XXIII.,"This prize who wins, though widely may extend"
18811,BOOK XXIII.,"His fertile fields, for five revolving years"
18812,BOOK XXIII.,It will his wants supply; nor to the town
18813,BOOK XXIII.,"For lack of iron, with this mass in store,"
18814,BOOK XXIII.,Need he his shepherd or his ploughman send.”
18815,BOOK XXIII.,
18816,BOOK XXIII.,"He said; and valiant Polypoetes rose,"
18817,BOOK XXIII.,"Epeius, and Leonteus’ godlike strength,"
18818,BOOK XXIII.,"And mighty Ajax, son of Telamon."
18819,BOOK XXIII.,In turns they took their stand; Epeius first
18820,BOOK XXIII.,"Uprais’d the pond’rous mass, and through the air"
18821,BOOK XXIII.,"Hurl’d it, amid the laughter of the Greeks."
18822,BOOK XXIII.,"Next came Leonteus, scion true of Mars;"
18823,BOOK XXIII.,The third was Ajax; from whose stalwart hand
18824,BOOK XXIII.,Beyond the farthest mark the missile flew.
18825,BOOK XXIII.,But when the valiant Polypoetes took
18826,BOOK XXIII.,"The quoit in hand, far as a herdsman throws"
18827,BOOK XXIII.,"His staff, that, whirling, flies among the herd;"
18828,BOOK XXIII.,So far beyond the ring’s extremest bound
18829,BOOK XXIII.,He threw the pond’rous mass; loud were the shouts;
18830,BOOK XXIII.,"And noble Polypoetes’ comrades rose,"
18831,BOOK XXIII.,And to the ships the monarch’s gift convey’d.
18832,BOOK XXIII.,
18833,BOOK XXIII.,"The archers’ prizes next, of iron hoar,"
18834,BOOK XXIII.,"Ten sturdy axes, double-edg’d, he plac’d,"
18835,BOOK XXIII.,And single hatchets ten; then far away
18836,BOOK XXIII.,"Rear’d on the sand a dark-prow’d vessel’s mast,"
18837,BOOK XXIII.,"On which, with slender string, a tim’rous dove"
18838,BOOK XXIII.,"Was fasten’d by the foot, the archers’ mark;"
18839,BOOK XXIII.,That who should strike the dove should to his tent
18840,BOOK XXIII.,The axes bear away; but who the string
18841,BOOK XXIII.,"Should sever, but should fail to strike the bird,"
18842,BOOK XXIII.,"As less in skill, the hatchets should receive."
18843,BOOK XXIII.,Thus spoke Achilles; straight uprose the might
18844,BOOK XXIII.,"Of royal Teucer, and Meriones,"
18845,BOOK XXIII.,The faithful follower of Idomeneus.
18846,BOOK XXIII.,They in a brass-bound helmet shook the lots.
18847,BOOK XXIII.,The first was Teucer’s; with impetuous force
18848,BOOK XXIII.,He shot; but vow’d not to the Archer-King
18849,BOOK XXIII.,Of firstling lambs a solemn hecatomb.
18850,BOOK XXIII.,"The dove he struck not, for the Archer-God"
18851,BOOK XXIII.,Withheld his aid; but close beside her foot
18852,BOOK XXIII.,The arrow sever’d the retaining string.
18853,BOOK XXIII.,"The bird releas’d, soar’d heav’nward; while the string"
18854,BOOK XXIII.,"Dropp’d, from the mast suspended, tow’rds the earth,"
18855,BOOK XXIII.,And loudly shouted their applause the Greeks.
18856,BOOK XXIII.,Then snatch’d Meriones in haste the bow
18857,BOOK XXIII.,From Teucer’s hand; his own already held
18858,BOOK XXIII.,"His arrow, pointed straight; he drew the string,"
18859,BOOK XXIII.,And to the far-destroying King he vow’d
18860,BOOK XXIII.,Of firstling lambs a solemn hecatomb.
18861,BOOK XXIII.,"Aloft amid the clouds he mark’d the dove,"
18862,BOOK XXIII.,"And struck her, as she soar’d, beneath the wing;"
18863,BOOK XXIII.,Right through the arrow pass’d; and to the earth
18864,BOOK XXIII.,"Returning, fell beside Meriones."
18865,BOOK XXIII.,The bird upon the dark-prow’d vessel’s mast
18866,BOOK XXIII.,"Lighted awhile; anon, with drooping head,"
18867,BOOK XXIII.,"And pinions flutt’ring vain, afar she fell,"
18868,BOOK XXIII.,Lifeless; th’ admiring crowd with wonder gaz’d.
18869,BOOK XXIII.,"Meriones the axes bore away,"
18870,BOOK XXIII.,While Teucer to the ships the hatchets bore.
18871,BOOK XXIII.,
18872,BOOK XXIII.,"Last, in the ring the son of Peleus laid"
18873,BOOK XXIII.,"A pond’rous spear, and caldron, burnish’d bright,"
18874,BOOK XXIII.,"Pric’d at an ox’s worth, untouch’d by fire,"
18875,BOOK XXIII.,For those who with the jav’lin would contend.
18876,BOOK XXIII.,"Uprose then Agamemnon, King of men,"
18877,BOOK XXIII.,"The son of Atreus, and Meriones,"
18878,BOOK XXIII.,The faithful follower of Idomeneus:
18879,BOOK XXIII.,But Peleus’ godlike son address’d them thus:
18880,BOOK XXIII.,
18881,BOOK XXIII.,"“How far, Atrides, thou excell’st us all,"
18882,BOOK XXIII.,And with the jav’lin what thy pow’r and skill
18883,BOOK XXIII.,"Pre-eminent, we know; take thou this prize,"
18884,BOOK XXIII.,And bear it to thy ships; and let us give
18885,BOOK XXIII.,To brave Meriones the brazen spear;
18886,BOOK XXIII.,"If so it please thee, such were my advice.”"
18887,BOOK XXIII.,
18888,BOOK XXIII.,"He said; and Agamemnon, King of men,"
18889,BOOK XXIII.,"Assenting, gave to brave Meriones"
18890,BOOK XXIII.,"The brazen spear; while in Talthybius’ care,"
18891,BOOK XXIII.,"His herald, plac’d the King his noble prize."

18919,THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR.,
18920,BOOK XXIV.,BOOK XXIV.
18921,BOOK XXIV.,
18922,BOOK XXIV.,"The games were ended, and the multitude"
18923,BOOK XXIV.,Amid the ships their sev’ral ways dispers’d:
18924,BOOK XXIV.,"Some to their supper, some to gentle sleep"
18925,BOOK XXIV.,"Yielding, delighted; but Achilles still"
18926,BOOK XXIV.,Mourn’d o’er his lov’d companion; not on him
18927,BOOK XXIV.,"Lighted all-conqu’ring sleep, but to and fro"
18928,BOOK XXIV.,"Restless he toss’d, and on Patroclus thought,"
18929,BOOK XXIV.,His vigour and his courage; all the deeds
18930,BOOK XXIV.,"They two together had achiev’d; the toils,"
18931,BOOK XXIV.,"The perils they had undergone, amid"
18932,BOOK XXIV.,"The strife of warriors, and the angry waves."
18933,BOOK XXIV.,"Stirr’d by such mem’ries, bitter tears he shed;"
18934,BOOK XXIV.,"Now turning on his side, and now again"
18935,BOOK XXIV.,Upon his back; then prone upon his face;
18936,BOOK XXIV.,"Then starting to his feet, along the shore"
18937,BOOK XXIV.,"All objectless, despairing, would he roam;"
18938,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor did the morn, above the sea appearing,"
18939,BOOK XXIV.,Unmark’d of him arise; his flying steeds
18940,BOOK XXIV.,"He then would harness, and, behind the car"
18941,BOOK XXIV.,"The corpse of Hector trailing in the dust,"
18942,BOOK XXIV.,Thrice make the circuit of Patroclus’ tomb;
18943,BOOK XXIV.,"Then would he turn within his tent to rest,"
18944,BOOK XXIV.,Leaving the prostrate corpse with dust defil’d;
18945,BOOK XXIV.,But from unseemly marks the valiant dead
18946,BOOK XXIV.,"Apollo guarded, who with pity view’d"
18947,BOOK XXIV.,"The hero, though in death; and round him threw"
18948,BOOK XXIV.,"His golden aegis; nor, though dragg’d along,"
18949,BOOK XXIV.,Allow’d his body to receive a wound.
18950,BOOK XXIV.,
18951,BOOK XXIV.,Thus foully did Achilles in his rage
18952,BOOK XXIV.,Misuse the mighty dead; the blessed Gods
18953,BOOK XXIV.,"With pitying grief beheld the sight, and urg’d"
18954,BOOK XXIV.,That Hermes should by stealth the corpse remove.
18955,BOOK XXIV.,"The counsel pleas’d the rest; but Juno still,"
18956,BOOK XXIV.,"And Neptune, and the blue-ey’d Maid, retain’d"
18957,BOOK XXIV.,"The hatred, unappeas’d, with which of old"
18958,BOOK XXIV.,Troy and her King and people they pursued;
18959,BOOK XXIV.,"Since Paris to the rival Goddesses,"
18960,BOOK XXIV.,"Who to his sheepfold came, gave deep offence,"
18961,BOOK XXIV.,Preferring her who brought him in return
18962,BOOK XXIV.,The fatal boon of too successful love.
18963,BOOK XXIV.,"But when the twelfth revolving day was come,"
18964,BOOK XXIV.,Apollo thus th’ assembled Gods address’d:
18965,BOOK XXIV.,"“Shame on ye, Gods, ungrateful! have ye not,"
18966,BOOK XXIV.,"At Hector’s hand, of bulls and choicest goats"
18967,BOOK XXIV.,Receiv’d your off’rings meet? and fear ye now
18968,BOOK XXIV.,"E’en his dead corpse to save, and grant his wife,"
18969,BOOK XXIV.,"His mother, and his child, his aged sire"
18970,BOOK XXIV.,"And people, to behold him, and to raise"
18971,BOOK XXIV.,"His fun’ral pile, and with due rites entomb?"
18972,BOOK XXIV.,But fell Achilles all your aid commands;
18973,BOOK XXIV.,"Of mind unrighteous, and inflexible"
18974,BOOK XXIV.,His stubborn heart; his thoughts are all of blood;
18975,BOOK XXIV.,"E’en as a lion, whom his mighty strength"
18976,BOOK XXIV.,"And dauntless courage lead to leap the fold,"
18977,BOOK XXIV.,And ’mid the trembling flocks to seize his prey;
18978,BOOK XXIV.,"E’en so Achilles hath discarded ruth,"
18979,BOOK XXIV.,"And conscience, arbiter of good and ill."
18980,BOOK XXIV.,"A man may lose his best-lov’d friend, a son,"
18981,BOOK XXIV.,"Or his own mother’s son, a brother dear:"
18982,BOOK XXIV.,"He mourns and weeps, but time his grief allays,"
18983,BOOK XXIV.,For fate to man a patient mind hath giv’n:
18984,BOOK XXIV.,"But godlike Hector’s body, after death,"
18985,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles, unrelenting, foully drags,"
18986,BOOK XXIV.,"Lash’d to his car, around his comrade’s tomb."
18987,BOOK XXIV.,"This is not to his praise; though brave he be,"
18988,BOOK XXIV.,"Yet thus our anger he may justly rouse,"
18989,BOOK XXIV.,Who in his rage insults the senseless clay.”
18990,BOOK XXIV.,
18991,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom, indignant, white-arm’d Juno thus:"
18992,BOOK XXIV.,"“Some show of reason were there in thy speech,"
18993,BOOK XXIV.,"God of the silver bow, could Hector boast"
18994,BOOK XXIV.,Of equal dignity with Peleus’ son.
18995,BOOK XXIV.,"A mortal one, and nurs’d at woman’s breast;"
18996,BOOK XXIV.,"The other, of a Goddess born, whom I"
18997,BOOK XXIV.,"Nurtur’d and rear’d, and to a mortal gave"
18998,BOOK XXIV.,"In marriage; gave to Peleus, best belov’d"
18999,BOOK XXIV.,"By all th’ Immortals, of the race of man."
19000,BOOK XXIV.,"Ye, Gods, attended all the marriage rites;"
19001,BOOK XXIV.,"Thou too, companion base, false friend, wast there,"
19002,BOOK XXIV.,"And, playing on thy lyre, didst share the feast.”"
19003,BOOK XXIV.,
19004,BOOK XXIV.,To whom the Cloud-compeller answer’d thus:
19005,BOOK XXIV.,"“Juno, restrain thy wrath; they shall not both"
19006,BOOK XXIV.,"Attain like honour; yet was Hector once,"
19007,BOOK XXIV.,"Of all the mortals that in Ilium dwell,"
19008,BOOK XXIV.,"Dearest to all the Gods, and chief to me;"
19009,BOOK XXIV.,For never did he fail his gifts to bring.
19010,BOOK XXIV.,"And with, burnt-off’rings and libations due"
19011,BOOK XXIV.,My altars crown; such worship I receiv’d.
19012,BOOK XXIV.,"Yet shall bold Hector’s body, not without"
19013,BOOK XXIV.,"The knowledge of Achilles, be remov’d;"
19014,BOOK XXIV.,For day and night his Goddess-mother keeps
19015,BOOK XXIV.,"Her constant watch beside him. Then, some God"
19016,BOOK XXIV.,Bid Thetis hither to my presence haste;
19017,BOOK XXIV.,"And I with prudent words will counsel her,"
19018,BOOK XXIV.,That so Achilles may at Priam’s hand
19019,BOOK XXIV.,"Large ransom take, and set brave Hector free.”"
19020,BOOK XXIV.,
19021,BOOK XXIV.,He said; and promptly on his errand sprang
19022,BOOK XXIV.,The storm-swift Iris; in the dark-blue sea
19023,BOOK XXIV.,"She plung’d, midway ’twixt Imbros’ rugged shore"
19024,BOOK XXIV.,And Samos’ isle; the parting waters plash’d.
19025,BOOK XXIV.,"As down to ocean’s lowest depths she dropp’d,"
19026,BOOK XXIV.,"Like to a plummet, which the fisherman"
19027,BOOK XXIV.,"Lets fall, encas’d in wild bull’s horn, to bear"
19028,BOOK XXIV.,Destruction to the sea’s voracious tribes.
19029,BOOK XXIV.,"There found she Thetis in a hollow cave,"
19030,BOOK XXIV.,Around her rang’d the Ocean Goddesses:
19031,BOOK XXIV.,"She, in the midst, was weeping o’er the fate"
19032,BOOK XXIV.,"Her matchless son awaiting, doom’d to die"
19033,BOOK XXIV.,"Far from his home, on fertile plains of Troy."
19034,BOOK XXIV.,"Swift-footed Iris at her side appear’d,"
19035,BOOK XXIV.,"And thus address’d her: “Hasten, Thetis; Jove,"
19036,BOOK XXIV.,"Lord of immortal counsel, summons thee.”"
19037,BOOK XXIV.,To whom the silver-footed Goddess thus:
19038,BOOK XXIV.,“What would with me the mighty King of Heav’n?
19039,BOOK XXIV.,"Press’d as I am with grief, I am asham’d"
19040,BOOK XXIV.,To mingle with the Gods; yet will I go:
19041,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor shall he speak in vain, whate’er his words.”"
19042,BOOK XXIV.,
19043,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus as she spoke, her veil the Goddess took,"
19044,BOOK XXIV.,"All black, than which none deeper could be found;"
19045,BOOK XXIV.,She rose to go; the storm-swift Iris led
19046,BOOK XXIV.,The way before her; ocean’s parted waves
19047,BOOK XXIV.,Around their path receded; to the beach
19048,BOOK XXIV.,"Ascending, upwards straight to Heav’n they sprang."
19049,BOOK XXIV.,"Th’ all-seeing son of Saturn there they found,"
19050,BOOK XXIV.,And rang’d around him all th’ immortal Gods.
19051,BOOK XXIV.,Pallas made way; and by the throne of Jove
19052,BOOK XXIV.,"Sat Thetis, Juno proff’ring to her hand"
19053,BOOK XXIV.,"A goblet fair of gold, and adding words"
19054,BOOK XXIV.,"Of welcome; she the cup receiv’d, and drank."
19055,BOOK XXIV.,Then thus began the sire of Gods and men:
19056,BOOK XXIV.,"“Thou, Thetis, sorrowing to Olympus com’st,"
19057,BOOK XXIV.,Borne down by ceaseless grief; I know it well;
19058,BOOK XXIV.,Yet hear the cause for which I summon’d thee.
19059,BOOK XXIV.,"About Achilles, thy victorious son,"
19060,BOOK XXIV.,"And valiant Hector’s body, for nine days"
19061,BOOK XXIV.,Hath contest been in Heav’n; and some have urg’d
19062,BOOK XXIV.,That Hermes should by stealth the corpse remove.
19063,BOOK XXIV.,"This to Achilles’ praise I mean to turn,"
19064,BOOK XXIV.,And thus thy rev’rence and thy love retain.
19065,BOOK XXIV.,"Then haste thee to the camp, and to thy son"
19066,BOOK XXIV.,My message bear; tell him that all the Gods
19067,BOOK XXIV.,Are fill’d with wrath; and I above the rest
19068,BOOK XXIV.,"Am angry, that beside the beaked ships,"
19069,BOOK XXIV.,"He, mad with rage, the corpse of Hector keeps:"
19070,BOOK XXIV.,"So may he fear me, and restore the dead."
19071,BOOK XXIV.,"Iris meantime to Priam I will send,"
19072,BOOK XXIV.,"And bid him seek the Grecian ships, and there"
19073,BOOK XXIV.,Obtain his son’s release: and with him bring
19074,BOOK XXIV.,Such presents as may melt Achilles’ heart.”
19075,BOOK XXIV.,
19076,BOOK XXIV.,He said; the silver-footed Queen obey’d;
19077,BOOK XXIV.,"Down from Olympus’ heights in haste she sped,"
19078,BOOK XXIV.,"And sought her son; him found she in his tent,"
19079,BOOK XXIV.,"Groaning with anguish, while his comrades round,"
19080,BOOK XXIV.,"Plying their tasks, prepar’d the morning meal."
19081,BOOK XXIV.,"For them a goodly sheep, full-fleec’d, was slain."
19082,BOOK XXIV.,"Close by his side his Goddess-mother stood,"
19083,BOOK XXIV.,"And gently touch’d him with her hand, and said,"
19084,BOOK XXIV.,"“How long, my son, wilt thou thy soul consume"
19085,BOOK XXIV.,"With grief and mourning, mindful nor of food"
19086,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor sleep? nor dost thou wisely, to abstain"
19087,BOOK XXIV.,From woman’s love; for short thy time on earth:
19088,BOOK XXIV.,Death and imperious fate are close at hand.
19089,BOOK XXIV.,Hear then my words; a messenger from Jove
19090,BOOK XXIV.,"To thee I come, to tell thee that the Gods"
19091,BOOK XXIV.,"Are fill’d with wrath, and he above the rest"
19092,BOOK XXIV.,"Is angry, that beside the beaked ships"
19093,BOOK XXIV.,"Thou, mad with rage, the corpse of Hector keep’st."
19094,BOOK XXIV.,"Then ransom take, and liberate the dead.”"
19095,BOOK XXIV.,
19096,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom Achilles, swift of foot, replied:"
19097,BOOK XXIV.,"“So be it; ransom let him bring, and bear"
19098,BOOK XXIV.,"His dead away, if such the will of Jove.”"
19099,BOOK XXIV.,
19100,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus, in the concourse of the ships, they two,"
19101,BOOK XXIV.,"Mother and son, their lengthen’d converse held."
19102,BOOK XXIV.,
19103,BOOK XXIV.,Then Saturn’s son to Iris gave command:
19104,BOOK XXIV.,"“Haste thee, swift Iris, from Olympus’ height,"
19105,BOOK XXIV.,"To Troy, to royal Priam bear my words;"
19106,BOOK XXIV.,"And bid him seek the Grecian ships, and there"
19107,BOOK XXIV.,Obtain his son’s release; and with him take
19108,BOOK XXIV.,Such presents as may melt Achilles’ heart.
19109,BOOK XXIV.,"Alone, no Trojan with him, must he go;"
19110,BOOK XXIV.,"Yet may a herald on his steps attend,"
19111,BOOK XXIV.,"Some aged man, his smoothly-rolling car"
19112,BOOK XXIV.,And mules to drive; and to the city back
19113,BOOK XXIV.,"To bring his dead, whom great Achilles slew."
19114,BOOK XXIV.,Nor let the fear of death disturb his mind:
19115,BOOK XXIV.,"Hermes shall with him, as his escort, go,"
19116,BOOK XXIV.,And to Achilles’ presence safely bring.
19117,BOOK XXIV.,"Arriv’d within the tent, nor he himself"
19118,BOOK XXIV.,"Will slay him, but from others will protect."
19119,BOOK XXIV.,"Not ignorant is he, nor void of sense,"
19120,BOOK XXIV.,Nor disobedient to the Gods’ behest
19121,BOOK XXIV.,But will with pitying eyes his suppliant view.”
19122,BOOK XXIV.,
19123,BOOK XXIV.,He said; and on his errand sped in haste
19124,BOOK XXIV.,The storm-swift Iris; when to Priam’s house
19125,BOOK XXIV.,"She came, the sounds of wailing met her ear."
19126,BOOK XXIV.,"Within the court, around their father, sat"
19127,BOOK XXIV.,"His sons, their raiment all bedew’d with tears;"
19128,BOOK XXIV.,"And in the midst, close cover’d with his robe,"
19129,BOOK XXIV.,"Their sire, his head and neck with dirt defil’d,"
19130,BOOK XXIV.,"Which, wallowing on the earth, himself had heap’d,"
19131,BOOK XXIV.,"With his own hands, upon his hoary head."
19132,BOOK XXIV.,Throughout the house his daughters loudly wail’d
19133,BOOK XXIV.,In mem’ry of the many and the brave
19134,BOOK XXIV.,"Who lay in death, by Grecian warriors slain."
19135,BOOK XXIV.,"Beside him stood the messenger of Jove,"
19136,BOOK XXIV.,"And whisper’d, while his limbs with terror shook:"
19137,BOOK XXIV.,"“Fear nothing, Priam, son of Dardanus,"
19138,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor let thy mind be troubled; not for ill,"
19139,BOOK XXIV.,But here on kindly errand am I sent:
19140,BOOK XXIV.,"To thee I come, a messenger from Jove,"
19141,BOOK XXIV.,Who from on high looks down on thee with eyes
19142,BOOK XXIV.,Of pitying love; he bids thee ransom home
19143,BOOK XXIV.,The godlike Hector’s corpse; and with thee take
19144,BOOK XXIV.,Such presents as may melt Achilles’ heart.
19145,BOOK XXIV.,"Alone, no Trojan with thee, must thou go;"
19146,BOOK XXIV.,"Yet may a herald on thy steps attend,"
19147,BOOK XXIV.,"Some aged man, thy smoothly-rolling car"
19148,BOOK XXIV.,"And mules to drive, and to the city back"
19149,BOOK XXIV.,"To bring thy dead, whom great Achilles slew."
19150,BOOK XXIV.,Nor let the fear of death disturb thy mind:
19151,BOOK XXIV.,"Hermes shall with thee, as thine escort, go,"
19152,BOOK XXIV.,And to Achilles’ presence safely bring.
19153,BOOK XXIV.,"Arriv’d within the tent, nor he himself"
19154,BOOK XXIV.,"Will slay thee, but from others will protect;"
19155,BOOK XXIV.,"Not ignorant is he, nor void of sense,"
19156,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor disobedient to the Gods’ behest,"
19157,BOOK XXIV.,But will with pitying eyes his suppliant view.”
19158,BOOK XXIV.,
19159,BOOK XXIV.,"Swift-footed Iris said, and vanish’d straight:"
19160,BOOK XXIV.,"He to his sons commandment gave, the mules"
19161,BOOK XXIV.,"To yoke beneath the smoothly-rolling car,"
19162,BOOK XXIV.,And on the axle fix the wicker seat.
19163,BOOK XXIV.,"Himself the lofty cedar chamber sought,"
19164,BOOK XXIV.,"Fragrant, high-roof’d, with countless treasures stor’d;"
19165,BOOK XXIV.,"And call’d to Hecuba his wife, and said,"
19166,BOOK XXIV.,"“Good wife, a messenger from Jove hath come,"
19167,BOOK XXIV.,"Who bids me seek the Grecian ships, and there"
19168,BOOK XXIV.,Obtain my son’s release; and with me take
19169,BOOK XXIV.,Such presents as may melt Achilles’ heart.
19170,BOOK XXIV.,"Say then, what think’st thou? for my mind inclines"
19171,BOOK XXIV.,To seek the ships within the Grecian camp.”
19172,BOOK XXIV.,
19173,BOOK XXIV.,"So he; but Hecuba lamenting cried,"
19174,BOOK XXIV.,"“Alas, alas! where are thy senses gone?"
19175,BOOK XXIV.,"And where the wisdom, once of high repute"
19176,BOOK XXIV.,"’Mid strangers, and ’mid those o’er whom thou reign’st?"
19177,BOOK XXIV.,"How canst thou think alone to seek the ships,"
19178,BOOK XXIV.,"Ent’ring his presence, who thy sons hath slain,"
19179,BOOK XXIV.,Many and brave? an iron heart is thine!
19180,BOOK XXIV.,"Of that bloodthirsty and perfidious man,"
19181,BOOK XXIV.,"If thou within the sight and reach shalt come,"
19182,BOOK XXIV.,"No pity will he feel, no rev’rence show:"
19183,BOOK XXIV.,Rather remain we here apart and mourn;
19184,BOOK XXIV.,"For him, when at his birth his thread of life"
19185,BOOK XXIV.,"Was spun by fate, ’twas destin’d that afar"
19186,BOOK XXIV.,"From home and parents, he should glut the maw"
19187,BOOK XXIV.,"Of rav’ning dogs, by that stern warrior’s tent,"
19188,BOOK XXIV.,Whose inmost heart I would I could devour:
19189,BOOK XXIV.,"Such for my son were adequate revenge,"
19190,BOOK XXIV.,Whom not in ignominious flight he slew;
19191,BOOK XXIV.,"But standing, thoughtless of escape or flight,"
19192,BOOK XXIV.,For Trojan men and Troy’s deep-bosom’d dames.”
19193,BOOK XXIV.,
19194,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom in answer Priam, godlike sire:"
19195,BOOK XXIV.,“Seek not to hinder me; nor be thyself
19196,BOOK XXIV.,A bird of evil omen in my house;
19197,BOOK XXIV.,For thou shalt not persuade me. If indeed
19198,BOOK XXIV.,"This message had been brought by mortal man,"
19199,BOOK XXIV.,"Prophet, or seer, or sacrificing priest,"
19200,BOOK XXIV.,"I should have deem’d it false, and laugh’d to scorn"
19201,BOOK XXIV.,The idle tale; but now (for I myself
19202,BOOK XXIV.,Both saw and heard the Goddess) I must go;
19203,BOOK XXIV.,Nor unfulfill’d shall be the words I speak:
19204,BOOK XXIV.,And if indeed it be my fate to die
19205,BOOK XXIV.,"Beside the vessels of the brass-clad Greeks,"
19206,BOOK XXIV.,I am content! by fierce Achilles’ hand
19207,BOOK XXIV.,"Let me be slain, so once more in my arms"
19208,BOOK XXIV.,"I hold my boy, and give my sorrow vent.”"
19209,BOOK XXIV.,"Then raising up the coffer’s polish’d lid,"
19210,BOOK XXIV.,"He chose twelve gorgeous shawls, twelve single cloaks."
19211,BOOK XXIV.,"As many rugs, as many splendid robes,"
19212,BOOK XXIV.,As many tunics; then of gold he took
19213,BOOK XXIV.,"Ten talents full; two tripods, burnish’d bright,"
19214,BOOK XXIV.,"Four caldrons; then a cup of beauty rare,"
19215,BOOK XXIV.,"A rich possession, which the men of Thrace"
19216,BOOK XXIV.,"Had giv’n, when there he went ambassador;"
19217,BOOK XXIV.,"E’en this he spar’d not, such his keen desire"
19218,BOOK XXIV.,His son to ransom. From the corridor
19219,BOOK XXIV.,With angry words he drove the Trojans all:
19220,BOOK XXIV.,
19221,BOOK XXIV.,"“Out with ye, worthless rascals, vagabonds!"
19222,BOOK XXIV.,"Have ye no griefs at home, that here ye come"
19223,BOOK XXIV.,To pester me? or is it not enough
19224,BOOK XXIV.,"That Jove with deep affliction visits me,"
19225,BOOK XXIV.,Slaying my bravest son? ye to your cost
19226,BOOK XXIV.,"Shall know his loss: since now that he is gone,"
19227,BOOK XXIV.,The Greeks shall find you easier far to slay.
19228,BOOK XXIV.,"But may my eyes be clos’d in death, ere see"
19229,BOOK XXIV.,"The city sack’d, and utterly destroy’d.”"
19230,BOOK XXIV.,
19231,BOOK XXIV.,"He said, and with his staff drove out the crowd;"
19232,BOOK XXIV.,Before the old man’s anger fled they all;
19233,BOOK XXIV.,Then to his sons in threat’ning tone he cried;
19234,BOOK XXIV.,"To Paris, Helenus, and Agathon,"
19235,BOOK XXIV.,"Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites brave,"
19236,BOOK XXIV.,"Deiphobus, and bold Hippothous,"
19237,BOOK XXIV.,And godlike Dius; all these nine with threats
19238,BOOK XXIV.,And angry taunts the aged sire assail’d:
19239,BOOK XXIV.,"“Haste, worthless sons, my scandal and my shame!"
19240,BOOK XXIV.,Would that ye all beside the Grecian ships
19241,BOOK XXIV.,"In Hector’s stead had died! Oh woe is me,"
19242,BOOK XXIV.,"Who have begotten sons, in all the land"
19243,BOOK XXIV.,The best and bravest; now remains not one;
19244,BOOK XXIV.,"Mestor, and Troilus, dauntless charioteer,"
19245,BOOK XXIV.,"And Hector, who a God ’mid men appear’d,"
19246,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor like a mortal’s offspring, but a God’s:"
19247,BOOK XXIV.,"All these hath Mars cut off; and left me none,"
19248,BOOK XXIV.,"None but the vile and refuse; liars all,"
19249,BOOK XXIV.,"Vain skipping coxcombs, in the dance alone,"
19250,BOOK XXIV.,"And in nought else renown’d; base plunderers,"
19251,BOOK XXIV.,"From their own countrymen, of lambs and kids."
19252,BOOK XXIV.,"When, laggards, will ye harness me the car"
19253,BOOK XXIV.,Equipp’d with all things needed for the way?”
19254,BOOK XXIV.,
19255,BOOK XXIV.,"He said; they quail’d beneath their father’s wrath,"
19256,BOOK XXIV.,"And brought the smoothly-running mule-wain out,"
19257,BOOK XXIV.,"Well-fram’d, new-built; and fix’d the wicker seat;"
19258,BOOK XXIV.,"Then from the peg the mule-yoke down they took,"
19259,BOOK XXIV.,"Of boxwood wrought, with boss and rings complete;"
19260,BOOK XXIV.,"And with the yoke, the yoke-band brought they forth,"
19261,BOOK XXIV.,Nine cubits long; and to the polish’d pole
19262,BOOK XXIV.,At the far end attach’d; the breast-rings then
19263,BOOK XXIV.,Fix’d to the pole-piece: and on either side
19264,BOOK XXIV.,Thrice round the knob the leathern thong they wound.
19265,BOOK XXIV.,"And bound it fast, and inward turn’d the tongue."
19266,BOOK XXIV.,"Then the rich ransom, from the chambers brought,"
19267,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Hector’s head, upon the wain they pil’d;"
19268,BOOK XXIV.,"And yok’d the strong-hoof’d mules, to harness train’d,"
19269,BOOK XXIV.,The Mysians’ splendid present to the King:
19270,BOOK XXIV.,"To Priam’s car they harness’d then the steeds,"
19271,BOOK XXIV.,Which he himself at polish’d manger fed.
19272,BOOK XXIV.,
19273,BOOK XXIV.,"Deep thoughts revolving, in the lofty halls"
19274,BOOK XXIV.,"Were met the herald and the aged King,"
19275,BOOK XXIV.,When Hecuba with troubled mind drew near;
19276,BOOK XXIV.,In her right hand a golden cup she bore
19277,BOOK XXIV.,"Of luscious wine, that ere they took their way"
19278,BOOK XXIV.,They to the Gods might due libations pour;
19279,BOOK XXIV.,"Before the car she stood, and thus she spoke:"
19280,BOOK XXIV.,"“Take, and to father Jove thine off’ring pour,"
19281,BOOK XXIV.,And pray that he may bring thee safely home
19282,BOOK XXIV.,From all thy foes; since sore against my will
19283,BOOK XXIV.,Thou needs wilt venture to the ships of Greece.
19284,BOOK XXIV.,"Then to Idaean Jove, the cloud-girt son"
19285,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Saturn, who th’ expanse of Troy surveys,"
19286,BOOK XXIV.,"Prefer thy pray’r, beseeching him to send,"
19287,BOOK XXIV.,"On thy right hand, a winged messenger,"
19288,BOOK XXIV.,"The bird he loves the best, of strongest flight;"
19289,BOOK XXIV.,"That thou thyself mayst see and know the sign,"
19290,BOOK XXIV.,"And, firm in faith, approach the ships of Greece."
19291,BOOK XXIV.,"But should all-seeing Jove the sign withhold,"
19292,BOOK XXIV.,"Then not with my consent shouldst thou attempt,"
19293,BOOK XXIV.,"Whate’er thy wish, to reach the Grecian ships.”"
19294,BOOK XXIV.,
19295,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom, in answer, godlike Priam thus:"
19296,BOOK XXIV.,"“O woman, I refuse not to obey"
19297,BOOK XXIV.,Thy counsel; good it is to raise the hands
19298,BOOK XXIV.,"In pray’r to Heav’n, and Jove’s protection seek.”"
19299,BOOK XXIV.,The old man said; and bade th’ attendant pour
19300,BOOK XXIV.,"Pure water on his hands; with ewer she,"
19301,BOOK XXIV.,"And basin, stood beside him: from his wife,"
19302,BOOK XXIV.,"The due ablutions made, he took the cup;"
19303,BOOK XXIV.,"Then in the centre of the court he stood,"
19304,BOOK XXIV.,"And as he pour’d the wine, look’d up to Heav’n,"
19305,BOOK XXIV.,And thus with voice uplifted pray’d aloud:
19306,BOOK XXIV.,"“O father Jove, who rul’st on Ida’s height,"
19307,BOOK XXIV.,"Most great, most glorious! grant that I may find"
19308,BOOK XXIV.,"Some pity in Achilles’ heart; and send,"
19309,BOOK XXIV.,"On my right hand, a winged messenger,"
19310,BOOK XXIV.,"The bird thou lov’st the best, of strongest flight,"
19311,BOOK XXIV.,"That I myself may see and know the sign,"
19312,BOOK XXIV.,"And, firm in faith, approach the ships of Greece.”"
19313,BOOK XXIV.,
19314,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus as he pray’d, the Lord of counsel heard;"
19315,BOOK XXIV.,"And sent forthwith an eagle, feather’d king,"
19316,BOOK XXIV.,"Dark bird of chase, and Dusky thence surnam’d:"
19317,BOOK XXIV.,"Wide as the portals, well secur’d with bolts,"
19318,BOOK XXIV.,"That guard some wealthy monarch’s lofty hall,"
19319,BOOK XXIV.,On either side his ample pinions spread.
19320,BOOK XXIV.,"On the right hand appear’d he, far above"
19321,BOOK XXIV.,The city soaring; they the fav’ring sign
19322,BOOK XXIV.,"With joy beheld, and ev’ry heart was cheer’d."
19323,BOOK XXIV.,"Mounting his car in haste, the aged King"
19324,BOOK XXIV.,"Drove thro’ the court, and thro’ the echoing porch;"
19325,BOOK XXIV.,"The mules in front, by sage Idaeus driv’n,"
19326,BOOK XXIV.,That drew the four-wheel’d wain; behind them came
19327,BOOK XXIV.,"The horses, down the city’s steep descent"
19328,BOOK XXIV.,Urg’d by th’ old man to speed; the crowd of friends
19329,BOOK XXIV.,"That follow’d mourn’d for him, as doom’d to death."
19330,BOOK XXIV.,"Descended from the city to the plain,"
19331,BOOK XXIV.,His sons and sons-in-law to Ilium took
19332,BOOK XXIV.,Their homeward way; advancing o’er the plain
19333,BOOK XXIV.,They two escap’d not Jove’s all-seeing eye;
19334,BOOK XXIV.,Pitying he saw the aged sire; and thus
19335,BOOK XXIV.,"At once to Hermes spoke, his much-lov’d son:"
19336,BOOK XXIV.,"“Hermes, for thou in social converse lov’st"
19337,BOOK XXIV.,"To mix with men, and hear’st whome’er thou wilt;"
19338,BOOK XXIV.,"Haste thee, and Priam to the Grecian ships"
19339,BOOK XXIV.,"So lead, that none of all the Greeks may see"
19340,BOOK XXIV.,Ere at Achilles’ presence he attain.”
19341,BOOK XXIV.,
19342,BOOK XXIV.,He said; nor disobey’d the heav’nly Guide;
19343,BOOK XXIV.,"His golden sandals on his feet he bound,"
19344,BOOK XXIV.,"Ambrosial work; which bore him o’er the waves,"
19345,BOOK XXIV.,"Swift as the wind, and o’er the wide-spread earth;"
19346,BOOK XXIV.,"Then took his rod, wherewith he seals at will"
19347,BOOK XXIV.,"The eyes of men, and wakes again from sleep."
19348,BOOK XXIV.,"This in his hand he bore, and sprang for flight."
19349,BOOK XXIV.,"Soon the wide Hellespont he reach’d, and Troy,"
19350,BOOK XXIV.,"And pass’d in likeness of a princely youth,"
19351,BOOK XXIV.,"In op’ning manhood, fairest term of life."
19352,BOOK XXIV.,
19353,BOOK XXIV.,"The twain had pass’d by Ilus’ lofty tomb,"
19354,BOOK XXIV.,And halted there the horses and the mules
19355,BOOK XXIV.,Beside the margin of the stream to drink;
19356,BOOK XXIV.,For darkness now was creeping o’er the earth:
19357,BOOK XXIV.,When through the gloom the herald Hermes saw
19358,BOOK XXIV.,"Approaching near, to Priam thus he cried:"
19359,BOOK XXIV.,"“O son of Dardanus, bethink thee well;"
19360,BOOK XXIV.,Of prudent counsel great is now our need.
19361,BOOK XXIV.,"A man I see, and fear he means us ill."
19362,BOOK XXIV.,"Say, with the horses shall we fly at once,"
19363,BOOK XXIV.,"Or clasp his knees, and for his mercy sue?”"
19364,BOOK XXIV.,"The old man heard, his mind confus’d with dread;"
19365,BOOK XXIV.,"So grievously he fear’d, that ev’ry hair"
19366,BOOK XXIV.,Upon his bended limbs did stand on end;
19367,BOOK XXIV.,He stood astounded; but the Guardian-God
19368,BOOK XXIV.,"Approach’d, and took him by the hand, and said:"
19369,BOOK XXIV.,"“Where, father, goest thou thus with horse and mule"
19370,BOOK XXIV.,"In the still night, when men are sunk in sleep?"
19371,BOOK XXIV.,"And fear’st thou not the slaughter-breathing Greeks,"
19372,BOOK XXIV.,"Thine unrelenting foes, and they so near?"
19373,BOOK XXIV.,"If any one of them should see thee now,"
19374,BOOK XXIV.,"So richly laden in the gloom of night,"
19375,BOOK XXIV.,"How wouldst thou feel? thou art not young thyself,"
19376,BOOK XXIV.,"And this old man, thy comrade, would avail"
19377,BOOK XXIV.,But little to protect thee from assault.
19378,BOOK XXIV.,"I will not harm thee, nay will shield from harm,"
19379,BOOK XXIV.,"For like my father’s is, methinks, thy face.”"
19380,BOOK XXIV.,
19381,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom in answer Priam, godlike sire:"
19382,BOOK XXIV.,"“’Tis as thou say’st, fair son; yet hath some God"
19383,BOOK XXIV.,"Extended o’er me his protecting hand,"
19384,BOOK XXIV.,"Who sends me such a guide, so opportune."
19385,BOOK XXIV.,Bless’d are thy parents in a son so grac’d
19386,BOOK XXIV.,"In face and presence, and of mind so wise.”"
19387,BOOK XXIV.,
19388,BOOK XXIV.,To whom in answer thus the Guardian-God:
19389,BOOK XXIV.,"“O father, well and wisely dost thou speak;"
19390,BOOK XXIV.,"But tell me this, and truly: dost thou bear"
19391,BOOK XXIV.,"These wealthy treasures to some foreign land,"
19392,BOOK XXIV.,That they for thee in safety may be stor’d?
19393,BOOK XXIV.,Or have ye all resolv’d to fly from Troy
19394,BOOK XXIV.,"In fear, your bravest slain, thy gallant son,"
19395,BOOK XXIV.,Who never from the Greeks’ encounter flinch’d?”
19396,BOOK XXIV.,
19397,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom in answer Priam, godlike sire:"
19398,BOOK XXIV.,"“Who art thou, noble Sir, and what thy race,"
19399,BOOK XXIV.,That speak’st thus fairly of my hapless son?”
19400,BOOK XXIV.,
19401,BOOK XXIV.,To whom in answer thus the Guardian-God:
19402,BOOK XXIV.,"“Try me, old man; of godlike Hector ask;"
19403,BOOK XXIV.,For often in the glory-giving fight
19404,BOOK XXIV.,"These eyes have seen him; chief, when to the ships"
19405,BOOK XXIV.,"The Greeks he drove, and with the sword destroy’d."
19406,BOOK XXIV.,We gaz’d in wonder; from the fight restrain’d
19407,BOOK XXIV.,"By Peleus’ son, with Agamemnon wroth."
19408,BOOK XXIV.,His follower I; one ship convey’d us both;
19409,BOOK XXIV.,One of the Myrmidons I am; my sire
19410,BOOK XXIV.,"Polyctor, rich, but aged, e’en as thou."
19411,BOOK XXIV.,"Six sons he hath, besides myself, the sev’nth;"
19412,BOOK XXIV.,And I by lot was drafted for the war.
19413,BOOK XXIV.,I from the ships am to the plain come forth;
19414,BOOK XXIV.,For with the dawn of day the keen-ey’d Greeks
19415,BOOK XXIV.,Will round the city marshal their array.
19416,BOOK XXIV.,They chafe in idleness; the chiefs in vain
19417,BOOK XXIV.,Strive to restrain their ardour for the fight.”
19418,BOOK XXIV.,
19419,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom in answer Priam, godlike sire:"
19420,BOOK XXIV.,"“If of Achilles, Peleus’ son, thou art"
19421,BOOK XXIV.,"Indeed a follower, tell me all the truth;"
19422,BOOK XXIV.,"Lies yet my son beside the Grecian ships,"
19423,BOOK XXIV.,"Or hath Achilles torn him limb from limb,"
19424,BOOK XXIV.,And to his dogs the mangled carcase giv’n?”
19425,BOOK XXIV.,
19426,BOOK XXIV.,To whom in answer thus the Guardian-God:
19427,BOOK XXIV.,"“On him, old man, nor dogs nor birds have fed,"
19428,BOOK XXIV.,But by the ship of Peleus’ son he lies
19429,BOOK XXIV.,"Within the tent; twelve days he there hath lain,"
19430,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor hath corruption touch’d his flesh, nor worms,"
19431,BOOK XXIV.,That wont to prey on men in battle slain.
19432,BOOK XXIV.,"The corpse, indeed, with each returning morn,"
19433,BOOK XXIV.,"Around his comrade’s tomb Achilles drags,"
19434,BOOK XXIV.,Yet leaves it still uninjur’d; thou thyself
19435,BOOK XXIV.,"Mightst see how fresh, as dew-besprent, he lies,"
19436,BOOK XXIV.,"From blood-stains cleans’d, and clos’d his many wounds,"
19437,BOOK XXIV.,For many a lance was buried in his corpse.
19438,BOOK XXIV.,"So, e’en in death, the blessed Gods above,"
19439,BOOK XXIV.,"Who lov’d him well, protect thy noble son.”"
19440,BOOK XXIV.,
19441,BOOK XXIV.,"He said; th’ old man rejoicing heard his words,"
19442,BOOK XXIV.,"And answer’d, “See, my son, how good it is"
19443,BOOK XXIV.,To give th’ immortal Gods their tribute due;
19444,BOOK XXIV.,"For never did my son, while yet he liv’d,"
19445,BOOK XXIV.,Neglect the Gods who on Olympus dwell;
19446,BOOK XXIV.,And thence have they remember’d him in death.
19447,BOOK XXIV.,"Accept, I pray, this goblet rich-emboss’d;"
19448,BOOK XXIV.,"Be thou my guard, and, under Heav’n, my guide,"
19449,BOOK XXIV.,Until I reach the tent of Peleus’ son.”
19450,BOOK XXIV.,
19451,BOOK XXIV.,To whom in answer thus the Guardian-God:
19452,BOOK XXIV.,"“Old father, me thy younger wouldst thou tempt,"
19453,BOOK XXIV.,In vain; who bidd’st me at thy hands accept
19454,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy proffer’d presents, to Achilles’ wrong."
19455,BOOK XXIV.,I dread his anger; and should hold it shame
19456,BOOK XXIV.,"To plunder him, through fear of future ill."
19457,BOOK XXIV.,"But, as thy guide, I could conduct thee safe,"
19458,BOOK XXIV.,"As far as Argos, journeying by thy side,"
19459,BOOK XXIV.,On ship-board or on foot; nor by the fault
19460,BOOK XXIV.,Of thy conductor shouldst thou meet with harm.”
19461,BOOK XXIV.,
19462,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus spoke the Guardian-God, and on the car"
19463,BOOK XXIV.,"Mounting in haste, he took the whip and reins,"
19464,BOOK XXIV.,And with fresh vigour mules and horses fill’d.
19465,BOOK XXIV.,"When to the ship-tow’rs and the trench they came,"
19466,BOOK XXIV.,The guard had late been busied with their meal;
19467,BOOK XXIV.,And with deep sleep the heav’nly Guide o’erspread
19468,BOOK XXIV.,"The eyes of all; then open’d wide the gates,"
19469,BOOK XXIV.,"And push’d aside the bolts, and led within"
19470,BOOK XXIV.,"Both Priam, and the treasure-laden wain."
19471,BOOK XXIV.,"But when they reach’d Achilles’ lofty tent,"
19472,BOOK XXIV.,(Which for their King the Myrmidons had built
19473,BOOK XXIV.,"Of fir-trees fell’d, and overlaid the roof"
19474,BOOK XXIV.,With rushes mown from off the neighb’ring mead;
19475,BOOK XXIV.,And all around a spacious court enclos’d
19476,BOOK XXIV.,With cross-set palisades; a single bar
19477,BOOK XXIV.,"Of fir the gateway guarded, which to shut"
19478,BOOK XXIV.,"Three men, of all the others, scarce suffic’d,"
19479,BOOK XXIV.,And three to open; but Achilles’ hand
19480,BOOK XXIV.,Unaided shut with ease the massive bar)
19481,BOOK XXIV.,"Then for the old man Hermes op’d the gate,"
19482,BOOK XXIV.,And brought within the court the gifts design’d
19483,BOOK XXIV.,For Peleus’ godlike son; then from the car
19484,BOOK XXIV.,"Sprang to the ground, and thus to Priam spoke:"
19485,BOOK XXIV.,"“Old man, a God hath hither been thy guide;"
19486,BOOK XXIV.,"Hermes I am, and sent to thee from Jove,"
19487,BOOK XXIV.,"Father of all, to bring thee safely here."
19488,BOOK XXIV.,"I now return, nor to Achilles’ eyes"
19489,BOOK XXIV.,Will I appear; beseems it not a God
19490,BOOK XXIV.,To greet a mortal in the sight of all.
19491,BOOK XXIV.,"But go thou in, and clasp Achilles’ knees,"
19492,BOOK XXIV.,"And supplicate him for his father’s sake,"
19493,BOOK XXIV.,"His fair-hair’d mother’s, and his child’s, that so"
19494,BOOK XXIV.,Thy words may stir an answer in his heart.”
19495,BOOK XXIV.,
19496,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus saying, Hermes to Olympus’ heights"
19497,BOOK XXIV.,"Return’d; and Priam from his chariot sprang,"
19498,BOOK XXIV.,"And left Idaeus there, in charge to keep"
19499,BOOK XXIV.,"The horses and the mules, while he himself"
19500,BOOK XXIV.,"Enter’d the dwelling straight, where wont to sit"
19501,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles, lov’d of Heav’n. The chief he found"
19502,BOOK XXIV.,"Within, his followers seated all apart;"
19503,BOOK XXIV.,"Two only in his presence minister’d,"
19504,BOOK XXIV.,"The brave Automedon, and Alcimus,"
19505,BOOK XXIV.,A warrior bold; scarce ended the repast
19506,BOOK XXIV.,Of food and wine; the table still was set.
19507,BOOK XXIV.,"Great Priam enter’d, unperceiv’d of all;"
19508,BOOK XXIV.,"And standing by Achilles, with his arms"
19509,BOOK XXIV.,"Embrac’d his knees, and kiss’d those fearful hands,"
19510,BOOK XXIV.,"Blood-stain’d, which many of his sons had slain."
19511,BOOK XXIV.,"As when a man, by cruel fate pursued,"
19512,BOOK XXIV.,"In his own land hath shed another’s blood,"
19513,BOOK XXIV.,"And flying, seeks beneath some wealthy house"
19514,BOOK XXIV.,"A foreign refuge; wond’ring, all behold:"
19515,BOOK XXIV.,On godlike Priam so with wonder gaz’d
19516,BOOK XXIV.,"Achilles; wonder seiz’d th’ attendants all,"
19517,BOOK XXIV.,And one to other looked; then Priam thus
19518,BOOK XXIV.,To Peleus’ son his suppliant speech address’d:
19519,BOOK XXIV.,"“Think, great Achilles, rival of the Gods,"
19520,BOOK XXIV.,"Upon thy father, e’en as I myself"
19521,BOOK XXIV.,Upon the threshold of unjoyous age:
19522,BOOK XXIV.,"And haply he, from them that dwell around"
19523,BOOK XXIV.,"May suffer wrong, with no protector near"
19524,BOOK XXIV.,"To give him aid; yet he, rejoicing, knows"
19525,BOOK XXIV.,That thou still liv’st; and day by day may hope
19526,BOOK XXIV.,To see his son returning safe from Troy;
19527,BOOK XXIV.,"While I, all hapless, that have many sons,"
19528,BOOK XXIV.,"The best and bravest through the breadth of Troy,"
19529,BOOK XXIV.,"Begotten, deem that none are left me now."
19530,BOOK XXIV.,"Fifty there were, when came the sons of Greece;"
19531,BOOK XXIV.,Nineteen the offspring of a single womb;
19532,BOOK XXIV.,"The rest, the women of my household bore."
19533,BOOK XXIV.,Of these have many by relentless Mars
19534,BOOK XXIV.,"Been laid in dust; but he, my only one,"
19535,BOOK XXIV.,"The city’s and his brethren’s sole defence,"
19536,BOOK XXIV.,"He, bravely fighting in his country’s cause,"
19537,BOOK XXIV.,"Hector, but lately by thy hand hath fall’n:"
19538,BOOK XXIV.,On his behalf I venture to approach
19539,BOOK XXIV.,The Grecian ships; for his release to thee
19540,BOOK XXIV.,"To make my pray’r, and priceless ransom pay."
19541,BOOK XXIV.,"Then thou, Achilles, reverence the Gods;"
19542,BOOK XXIV.,"And, for thy father’s sake, look pitying down"
19543,BOOK XXIV.,"On me, more needing pity; since I bear"
19544,BOOK XXIV.,Such grief as never man on earth hath borne.
19545,BOOK XXIV.,Who stoop to kiss the hand that slew my son.”
19546,BOOK XXIV.,
19547,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus as he spoke, within Achilles’ breast"
19548,BOOK XXIV.,Fond mem’ry of his father rose; he touch’d
19549,BOOK XXIV.,"The old man’s hand, and gently put him by;"
19550,BOOK XXIV.,"Then wept they both, by various mem’ries stirr’d:"
19551,BOOK XXIV.,"One, prostrate at Achilles’ feet, bewail’d"
19552,BOOK XXIV.,"His warrior son; Achilles for his sire,"
19553,BOOK XXIV.,"And for Patroclus wept, his comrade dear;"
19554,BOOK XXIV.,And through the house their weeping loud was heard.
19555,BOOK XXIV.,"But when Achilles had indulg’d his grief,"
19556,BOOK XXIV.,"And eas’d the yearning of his heart and limbs,"
19557,BOOK XXIV.,"Uprising, with his hand the aged sire,"
19558,BOOK XXIV.,"Pitying his hoary head and hoary beard,"
19559,BOOK XXIV.,"He rais’d, and thus with gentle words address’d:"
19560,BOOK XXIV.,
19561,BOOK XXIV.,"“Alas, what sorrows, poor old man, are thine!"
19562,BOOK XXIV.,How couldst thou venture to the Grecian ships
19563,BOOK XXIV.,"Alone, and to the presence of the man"
19564,BOOK XXIV.,"Whose hand hath slain so many of thy sons,"
19565,BOOK XXIV.,Many and brave? an iron heart is thine!
19566,BOOK XXIV.,"But sit thou on this seat; and in our hearts,"
19567,BOOK XXIV.,"Though filled with grief, let us that grief suppress;"
19568,BOOK XXIV.,For woful lamentation nought avails.
19569,BOOK XXIV.,"Such, is the thread the Gods for mortals spin,"
19570,BOOK XXIV.,"To live in woe, while they from cares are free."
19571,BOOK XXIV.,"Two coffers lie beside the door of Jove,"
19572,BOOK XXIV.,"With gifts for man: one good, the other ill;"
19573,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom from each the Lord of lightning gives,"
19574,BOOK XXIV.,"Him sometimes evil, sometimes good befalls;"
19575,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom the ill alone, him foul disgrace"
19576,BOOK XXIV.,And grinding mis’ry o’er the earth pursue:
19577,BOOK XXIV.,By God and man alike despis’d he roams.
19578,BOOK XXIV.,Thus from his birth the Gods to Peleus gave
19579,BOOK XXIV.,Excellent gifts; with wealth and substance bless’d
19580,BOOK XXIV.,Above his fellows; o’er the Myrmidons
19581,BOOK XXIV.,He rul’d with sov’reign sway; and Heav’n bestow’d
19582,BOOK XXIV.,"On him, a mortal, an immortal bride."
19583,BOOK XXIV.,"Yet this of ill was mingled in his lot,"
19584,BOOK XXIV.,That in his house no rising race he saw
19585,BOOK XXIV.,"Of future Kings; one only son he had,"
19586,BOOK XXIV.,One doom’d to early death; nor is it mine
19587,BOOK XXIV.,To tend my father’s age; but far from home
19588,BOOK XXIV.,Thee and thy sons in Troy I vex with war.
19589,BOOK XXIV.,Much have we heard too of thy former wealth;
19590,BOOK XXIV.,"Above what Lesbos northward, Macar’s seat,"
19591,BOOK XXIV.,"Contains, and Upper Phrygia, and the shores"
19592,BOOK XXIV.,"Of boundless Hellespont, ’tis said that thou"
19593,BOOK XXIV.,In wealth and number of thy sons wast bless’d.
19594,BOOK XXIV.,"But since on thee this curse the Gods have brought,"
19595,BOOK XXIV.,Still round thy city war and murder rage.
19596,BOOK XXIV.,"Bear up, nor thus with grief incessant mourn;"
19597,BOOK XXIV.,Vain is thy sorrow for thy gallant son;
19598,BOOK XXIV.,"Thou canst not raise him, and mayst suffer more.”"
19599,BOOK XXIV.,
19600,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom in answer Priam, godlike sire;"
19601,BOOK XXIV.,"“Tell me not yet, illustrious chief, to sit,"
19602,BOOK XXIV.,"While Hector lies, uncar’d for, in the tent;"
19603,BOOK XXIV.,"But let me quickly go, that with mine eyes"
19604,BOOK XXIV.,I may behold my son; and thou accept
19605,BOOK XXIV.,The ample treasures which we tender thee:
19606,BOOK XXIV.,"Mayst thou enjoy them, and in safety reach"
19607,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy native land, since thou hast spar’d my life,"
19608,BOOK XXIV.,And bidd’st me still behold the light of Heav’n.”
19609,BOOK XXIV.,
19610,BOOK XXIV.,To whom Achilles thus with stern regard:
19611,BOOK XXIV.,"“Old man, incense me not; I mean myself"
19612,BOOK XXIV.,To give thee back thy son; for here of late
19613,BOOK XXIV.,"Despatch’d by Jove, my Goddess-mother came,"
19614,BOOK XXIV.,The daughter of the aged Ocean-God:
19615,BOOK XXIV.,"And thee too, Priam, well I know, some God"
19616,BOOK XXIV.,(I cannot err) hath guided to our ships.
19617,BOOK XXIV.,"No mortal, though in vent’rous youth, would dare"
19618,BOOK XXIV.,Our camp to enter; nor could hope to pass
19619,BOOK XXIV.,"Unnotic’d by the watch, nor easily"
19620,BOOK XXIV.,Remove the pond’rous bar that guards our doors.
19621,BOOK XXIV.,But stir not up my anger in my grief;
19622,BOOK XXIV.,"Lest, suppliant though thou be, within my tent"
19623,BOOK XXIV.,"I brook thee not, and Jove’s command transgress.”"
19624,BOOK XXIV.,
19625,BOOK XXIV.,"He said; the old man trembled, and obey’d;"
19626,BOOK XXIV.,"Then to the door-way, with a lion’s spring,"
19627,BOOK XXIV.,Achilles rush’d; not unaccompanied;
19628,BOOK XXIV.,"With him Automedon and Alcimus,"
19629,BOOK XXIV.,"His two attendants, of his followers all,"
19630,BOOK XXIV.,"Next to the lost Patroclus, best-esteem’d;"
19631,BOOK XXIV.,They from the yoke the mules and horses loos’d;
19632,BOOK XXIV.,"Then led the herald of the old man in,"
19633,BOOK XXIV.,And bade him sit; and from the polish’d wain
19634,BOOK XXIV.,The costly ransom took of Hector’s head.
19635,BOOK XXIV.,"Two robes they left, and one well-woven vest,"
19636,BOOK XXIV.,"To clothe the corpse, and send with honour home."
19637,BOOK XXIV.,Then to the female slaves he gave command
19638,BOOK XXIV.,"To wash the body, and anoint with oil,"
19639,BOOK XXIV.,"Apart, that Priam might not see his son;"
19640,BOOK XXIV.,Lest his griev’d heart its passion unrestrain’d
19641,BOOK XXIV.,"Should utter, and Achilles, rous’d to wrath,"
19642,BOOK XXIV.,"His suppliant slay, and Jove’s command transgress."
19643,BOOK XXIV.,"When they had wash’d the body, and with oil"
19644,BOOK XXIV.,"Anointed, and around it wrapp’d the robe"
19645,BOOK XXIV.,"And vest, Achilles lifted up the dead"
19646,BOOK XXIV.,"With his own hands, and laid him on the couch;"
19647,BOOK XXIV.,Which to the polish’d wain his followers rais’d.
19648,BOOK XXIV.,"Then groaning, on his friend by name he call’d:"
19649,BOOK XXIV.,"“Forgive, Patroclus! be not wroth with me,"
19650,BOOK XXIV.,If in the realm of darkness thou shouldst hear
19651,BOOK XXIV.,"That godlike Hector to his father’s arms,"
19652,BOOK XXIV.,"For no mean ransom, I restore; whereof"
19653,BOOK XXIV.,A fitting share for thee I set aside.”
19654,BOOK XXIV.,
19655,BOOK XXIV.,"This said, Achilles to the tent return’d;"
19656,BOOK XXIV.,"On the carv’d couch, from whence he rose, he sat"
19657,BOOK XXIV.,Beside the wall; and thus to Priam spoke:
19658,BOOK XXIV.,
19659,BOOK XXIV.,"“Old man, thy son, according to thy pray’r,"
19660,BOOK XXIV.,Is giv’n thee back; upon the couch he lies;
19661,BOOK XXIV.,Thyself shalt see him at the dawn of day.
19662,BOOK XXIV.,Meanwhile the ev’ning meal demands our care.
19663,BOOK XXIV.,Not fair-hair’d Niobe abstain’d from food
19664,BOOK XXIV.,"When in the house her children lay in death,"
19665,BOOK XXIV.,Six beauteous daughters and six stalwart sons.
19666,BOOK XXIV.,"The youths, Apollo with his silver bow,"
19667,BOOK XXIV.,"The maids, the Archer-Queen, Diana, slew,"
19668,BOOK XXIV.,With anger fill’d that Niobe presum’d
19669,BOOK XXIV.,"Herself with fair Latona to compare,"
19670,BOOK XXIV.,Her many children with her rival’s two;
19671,BOOK XXIV.,So by the two were all the many slain.
19672,BOOK XXIV.,Nine days in death they lay; and none was there
19673,BOOK XXIV.,To pay their fun’ral rites; for Saturn’s son
19674,BOOK XXIV.,Had given to all the people hearts of stone.
19675,BOOK XXIV.,At length th’ immortal Gods entomb’d the dead.
19676,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor yet did Niobe, when now her grief"
19677,BOOK XXIV.,"Had worn itself in tears, from food refrain."
19678,BOOK XXIV.,"And now in Sipylus, amid the rocks,"
19679,BOOK XXIV.,"And lonely mountains, where the Goddess nymphs"
19680,BOOK XXIV.,"That love to dance by Achelous’ stream,"
19681,BOOK XXIV.,"’Tis said, were cradled, she, though turn’d to stone,"
19682,BOOK XXIV.,Broods o’er the wrongs inflicted by the Gods.
19683,BOOK XXIV.,"So we too, godlike sire, the meal may share;"
19684,BOOK XXIV.,"And later, thou thy noble son mayst mourn,"
19685,BOOK XXIV.,To Troy restor’d—well worthy he thy tears.”
19686,BOOK XXIV.,
19687,BOOK XXIV.,"This said, he slaughter’d straight a white-fleec’d sheep;"
19688,BOOK XXIV.,His comrades then the carcase flay’d and dress’d:
19689,BOOK XXIV.,"The meat prepar’d, and fasten’d to the spits;"
19690,BOOK XXIV.,"Roasted with care, and from the fire withdrew."
19691,BOOK XXIV.,The bread Automedon from baskets fair
19692,BOOK XXIV.,Apportion’d out; the meat Achilles shar’d.
19693,BOOK XXIV.,They on the viands set before them fell.
19694,BOOK XXIV.,"The rage of thirst and hunger satisfied,"
19695,BOOK XXIV.,"In wonder Priam on Achilles gaz’d,"
19696,BOOK XXIV.,His form and stature; as a God he seem’d;
19697,BOOK XXIV.,"And he too look’d on Priam, and admir’d"
19698,BOOK XXIV.,"His venerable face, and gracious speech."
19699,BOOK XXIV.,"With mutual pleasure each on other gaz’d,"
19700,BOOK XXIV.,Till godlike Priam first address’d his host:
19701,BOOK XXIV.,
19702,BOOK XXIV.,"“Dismiss me now, illustrious chief, to rest;"
19703,BOOK XXIV.,"And lie we down, in gentle slumbers wrapp’d;"
19704,BOOK XXIV.,"For never have mine eyes been clos’d in sleep,"
19705,BOOK XXIV.,Since by thy hand my gallant son was slain:
19706,BOOK XXIV.,"But groaning still, I brood upon my woes,"
19707,BOOK XXIV.,And in my court with dust my head defile.
19708,BOOK XXIV.,"Now have I tasted bread, now ruddy wine"
19709,BOOK XXIV.,Hath o’er my palate pass’d; but not till now.”
19710,BOOK XXIV.,
19711,BOOK XXIV.,Thus he; his comrades and th’ attendant maids
19712,BOOK XXIV.,Achilles order’d in the corridor
19713,BOOK XXIV.,"Two mattresses to place, with blankets fair"
19714,BOOK XXIV.,Of purple wool o’erlaid; and on the top
19715,BOOK XXIV.,Rugs and soft sheets for upper cov’ring spread.
19716,BOOK XXIV.,"They from the chamber, torch in hand, withdrew,"
19717,BOOK XXIV.,And with obedient haste two beds prepar’d.
19718,BOOK XXIV.,Then thus Achilles spoke in jesting tone:
19719,BOOK XXIV.,"“Thou needs must sleep without, my good old friend;"
19720,BOOK XXIV.,"Lest any leader of the Greeks should come,"
19721,BOOK XXIV.,"As is their custom, to confer with me;"
19722,BOOK XXIV.,Of them whoe’er should find thee here by night
19723,BOOK XXIV.,"Forthwith to Agamemnon would report,"
19724,BOOK XXIV.,"And Hector might not be so soon, restor’d."
19725,BOOK XXIV.,But tell me truly this; how many days
19726,BOOK XXIV.,For godlike Hector’s fun’ral rites ye need;
19727,BOOK XXIV.,That for so long a time I may myself
19728,BOOK XXIV.,"Refrain from combat, and the people stay.”"
19729,BOOK XXIV.,
19730,BOOK XXIV.,"To whom in answer Priam, godlike sire:"
19731,BOOK XXIV.,“If by thy leave we may indeed perform
19732,BOOK XXIV.,"His fun’ral rites, to thee, Achilles, great"
19733,BOOK XXIV.,"Will be our gratitude, if this thou grant."
19734,BOOK XXIV.,Thou know’st how close the town is hemm’d around;
19735,BOOK XXIV.,"And from the mountain, distant as it is,"
19736,BOOK XXIV.,The Trojans well may fear to draw the wood.
19737,BOOK XXIV.,Nine days to public mourning would we give;
19738,BOOK XXIV.,"The tenth, to fun’ral rites and fun’ral feast;"
19739,BOOK XXIV.,Then on th’ eleventh would we raise his mound;
19740,BOOK XXIV.,"The twelfth, renew the war, if needs we must.”"
19741,BOOK XXIV.,
19742,BOOK XXIV.,To whom Achilles swift of foot replied:
19743,BOOK XXIV.,"“So shall it be, old Priam; I engage"
19744,BOOK XXIV.,To stay the battle for the time requir’d.”
19745,BOOK XXIV.,
19746,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus speaking, with his hand the old man’s wrist"
19747,BOOK XXIV.,"He grasp’d, in token that he need not fear."
19748,BOOK XXIV.,Then in the corridor lay down to rest
19749,BOOK XXIV.,"Old Priam and the herald, Elders sage;"
19750,BOOK XXIV.,"While in his tent’s recess Achilles slept,"
19751,BOOK XXIV.,The fair Briseis resting by his side.
19752,BOOK XXIV.,
19753,BOOK XXIV.,"In night-long slumbers lay the other Gods,"
19754,BOOK XXIV.,"And helmed chiefs, by gentle sleep subdued;"
19755,BOOK XXIV.,"But on the eyes of Hermes, Guardian-God,"
19756,BOOK XXIV.,"No slumber fell, deep pond’ring in his mind"
19757,BOOK XXIV.,How from the ships in safety to conduct
19758,BOOK XXIV.,"The royal Priam, and the guard elude."
19759,BOOK XXIV.,"Above the sleeper’s head he stood, and cried:"
19760,BOOK XXIV.,"“Old man, small heed thou tak’st of coming ill,"
19761,BOOK XXIV.,"Who, when Achilles gives thee leave to go,"
19762,BOOK XXIV.,"Sleep’st undisturb’d, surrounded by thy foes."
19763,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy son hath been restor’d, and thou hast paid"
19764,BOOK XXIV.,"A gen’rous price; but to redeem thy life,"
19765,BOOK XXIV.,If Agamemnon and the other Greeks
19766,BOOK XXIV.,"Should know that thou art here, full thrice so much"
19767,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy sons, who yet are left, would have to pay.”"
19768,BOOK XXIV.,
19769,BOOK XXIV.,"He said; the old man trembled, and arous’d"
19770,BOOK XXIV.,The herald; while the horses and the mules
19771,BOOK XXIV.,"Were yok’d by Hermes, who with silent speed"
19772,BOOK XXIV.,"Drove through th’ encampment, unobserv’d of all."
19773,BOOK XXIV.,"But when they came to eddying Xanthus’ ford,"
19774,BOOK XXIV.,"Fair-flowing stream, born of immortal Jove,"
19775,BOOK XXIV.,"To high Olympus Hermes took his flight,"
19776,BOOK XXIV.,"As morn, in saffron robe, o’er all the earth"
19777,BOOK XXIV.,Was light diffusing; they with fun’ral wail
19778,BOOK XXIV.,Drove cityward the horses; following came
19779,BOOK XXIV.,The mules that drew the litter of the dead.
19780,BOOK XXIV.,"The plain they travers’d o’er, observ’d of none,"
19781,BOOK XXIV.,"Or man or woman, till Cassandra, fair"
19782,BOOK XXIV.,"As golden Venus, from the topmost height"
19783,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Pergamus, her father in his car"
19784,BOOK XXIV.,"Upstanding saw, the herald at his side."
19785,BOOK XXIV.,"Him too she saw, who on the litter lay;"
19786,BOOK XXIV.,"Then lifted up her voice, and cried aloud"
19787,BOOK XXIV.,"To all the city, “Hither, Trojans, come,"
19788,BOOK XXIV.,"Both men and women, Hector see restor’d;"
19789,BOOK XXIV.,"If, while he liv’d, returning from the fight,"
19790,BOOK XXIV.,"Ye met him e’er rejoicing, who indeed"
19791,BOOK XXIV.,Was all the city’s chiefest joy and pride.”
19792,BOOK XXIV.,
19793,BOOK XXIV.,She said; nor man nor woman then was left
19794,BOOK XXIV.,Within the city; o’er the minds of all
19795,BOOK XXIV.,"Grief pass’d, resistless; to the gates in throngs"
19796,BOOK XXIV.,"They press’d, to crowd round him who brought the dead."
19797,BOOK XXIV.,The first to clasp the body were his wife
19798,BOOK XXIV.,And honour’d mother; eagerly they sprang
19799,BOOK XXIV.,"On the smooth-rolling wain, to touch the head"
19800,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Hector; round them, weeping, stood the crowd"
19801,BOOK XXIV.,"Weeping, till sunset, all the live-long day"
19802,BOOK XXIV.,Had they before the gates for Hector mourn’d;
19803,BOOK XXIV.,Had not old Priam from the car address’d
19804,BOOK XXIV.,"The crowd: “Make way, that so the mules may pass;"
19805,BOOK XXIV.,"When to my house I shall have brought my dead,"
19806,BOOK XXIV.,Ye there may vent your sorrow as ye will.”
19807,BOOK XXIV.,
19808,BOOK XXIV.,"Thus as he spoke, obedient to his word"
19809,BOOK XXIV.,"They stood aside, and for the car made way:"
19810,BOOK XXIV.,"But when to Priam’s lordly house they came,"
19811,BOOK XXIV.,"They laid him on a rich-wrought couch, and call’d"
19812,BOOK XXIV.,"The minstrels in, who by the hero’s bed"
19813,BOOK XXIV.,Should lead the melancholy chorus; they
19814,BOOK XXIV.,"Pour’d forth the music of the mournful dirge,"
19815,BOOK XXIV.,While women’s voices join’d in loud lament.
19816,BOOK XXIV.,"White-arm’d Andromache the wail began,"
19817,BOOK XXIV.,The head of Hector clasping in her hands:
19818,BOOK XXIV.,"“My husband, thou art gone in pride of youth,"
19819,BOOK XXIV.,And in thine house hast left me desolate;
19820,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy child an infant still, thy child and mine,"
19821,BOOK XXIV.,Unhappy parents both! nor dare I hope
19822,BOOK XXIV.,That he may reach the ripeness of his youth;
19823,BOOK XXIV.,"For ere that day shall Troy in ruin fall,"
19824,BOOK XXIV.,"Since thou art gone, her guardian! thou whose arm"
19825,BOOK XXIV.,"Defended her, her wives, and helpless babes!"
19826,BOOK XXIV.,"They now shall shortly o’er the sea be borne,"
19827,BOOK XXIV.,"And with them I shall go; thou too, my child,"
19828,BOOK XXIV.,"Must follow me, to servile labour doom’d,"
19829,BOOK XXIV.,The suff’ring victim of a tyrant Lord;
19830,BOOK XXIV.,Unless perchance some angry Greek may seize
19831,BOOK XXIV.,And dash thee from the tow’r—a woful death!
19832,BOOK XXIV.,"Whose brother, or whose father, or whose son"
19833,BOOK XXIV.,By Hector hath been slain; for many a Greek
19834,BOOK XXIV.,By Hector’s hand hath bit the bloody dust;
19835,BOOK XXIV.,Not light in battle was thy father’s hand!
19836,BOOK XXIV.,Therefore for him the gen’ral city mourns;
19837,BOOK XXIV.,"Thou to thy parents bitter grief hast caus’d,"
19838,BOOK XXIV.,Hector! but bitt’rest grief of all hast left
19839,BOOK XXIV.,To me! for not to me was giv’n to clasp
19840,BOOK XXIV.,"The hand extended from thy dying bed,"
19841,BOOK XXIV.,"Nor words of wisdom catch, which night and day,"
19842,BOOK XXIV.,"With tears, I might have treasur’d in my heart.”"
19843,BOOK XXIV.,
19844,BOOK XXIV.,Weeping she spoke—the women join’d the wail.
19845,BOOK XXIV.,Then Hecuba took up the loud lament:
19846,BOOK XXIV.,"“Hector, of all my children dearest thou!"
19847,BOOK XXIV.,"Dear to th’ Immortals too in life wast thou,"
19848,BOOK XXIV.,And they in death have borne thee still in mind;
19849,BOOK XXIV.,"For other of my sons, his captives made,"
19850,BOOK XXIV.,"Across the wat’ry waste, to Samos’ isle"
19851,BOOK XXIV.,"Or Imbros, or th’ inhospitable shore"
19852,BOOK XXIV.,"Of Lemnos, hath Achilles, swift of foot,"
19853,BOOK XXIV.,"To slav’ry sold; thee, when his sharp-edg’d spear"
19854,BOOK XXIV.,"Had robb’d thee of thy life, he dragg’d indeed"
19855,BOOK XXIV.,"Around Patroclus’ tomb, his comrade dear,"
19856,BOOK XXIV.,Whom thou hadst slain; yet so he rais’d not up
19857,BOOK XXIV.,"His dead to life again; now liest thou here,"
19858,BOOK XXIV.,"All fresh and fair, as dew-besprent; like one"
19859,BOOK XXIV.,"Whom bright Apollo, with his arrows keen,"
19860,BOOK XXIV.,"God of the silver bow, hath newly slain.”"
19861,BOOK XXIV.,
19862,BOOK XXIV.,"Weeping, she spoke; and rous’d the gen’ral grief."
19863,BOOK XXIV.,"Then Helen, third, the mournful strain renew’d:"
19864,BOOK XXIV.,"“Hector, of all my brethren dearest thou!"
19865,BOOK XXIV.,"True, godlike Paris claims me as his wife,"
19866,BOOK XXIV.,Who bore me hither—would I then had died!
19867,BOOK XXIV.,"But twenty years have pass’d since here I came,"
19868,BOOK XXIV.,And left my native land; yet ne’er from thee
19869,BOOK XXIV.,"I heard one scornful, one degrading word;"
19870,BOOK XXIV.,"And when from others I have borne reproach,"
19871,BOOK XXIV.,"Thy brothers, sisters, or thy brothers’ wives,"
19872,BOOK XXIV.,"Or mother, (for thy sire was ever kind"
19873,BOOK XXIV.,E’en as a father) thou hast check’d them still
19874,BOOK XXIV.,"With tender feeling, and with gentle words."
19875,BOOK XXIV.,"For thee I weep, and for myself no less:"
19876,BOOK XXIV.,"For, through the breadth of Troy, none love me now,"
19877,BOOK XXIV.,"None kindly look on me, but all abhor.”"
19878,BOOK XXIV.,
19879,BOOK XXIV.,"Weeping she spoke, and with her wept the crowd."
19880,BOOK XXIV.,At length the aged Priam gave command:
19881,BOOK XXIV.,"“Haste now, ye Trojans, to the city bring"
19882,BOOK XXIV.,Good store of fuel; fear no treach’rous wile;
19883,BOOK XXIV.,"For when he sent me from the dark-ribb’d ships,"
19884,BOOK XXIV.,Achilles promis’d that from hostile arms
19885,BOOK XXIV.,Till the twelfth morn we should no harm sustain.”
19886,BOOK XXIV.,
19887,BOOK XXIV.,He said; and they the oxen and the mules
19888,BOOK XXIV.,"Yok’d to the wains, and from the city throng’d:"
19889,BOOK XXIV.,"Nine days they labour’d, and brought back to Troy"
19890,BOOK XXIV.,Good store of wood; but when the tenth day’s light
19891,BOOK XXIV.,"Upon the earth appear’d, weeping, they bore"
19892,BOOK XXIV.,Brave Hector out; and on the fun’ral pile
19893,BOOK XXIV.,"Laying the glorious dead, applied the torch."
19894,BOOK XXIV.,
19895,BOOK XXIV.,While yet the rosy-finger’d morn was young
19896,BOOK XXIV.,Round noble Hector’s pyre the people press’d:
19897,BOOK XXIV.,"When all were gather’d round, and closely throng’d"
19898,BOOK XXIV.,"First on the burning mass, as far as spread"
19899,BOOK XXIV.,"The range of fire, they pour’d the ruddy wine,"
19900,BOOK XXIV.,And quench’d the flames: his brethren then and friends
19901,BOOK XXIV.,"Weeping, the hot tears flowing down their cheeks,"
19902,BOOK XXIV.,Collected from the pile the whiten’d bones;
19903,BOOK XXIV.,"These in a golden casket they enclos’d,"
19904,BOOK XXIV.,And o’er it spread soft shawls of purple dye;
19905,BOOK XXIV.,"Then in a grave they laid it, and in haste"
19906,BOOK XXIV.,With stone in pond’rous masses cover’d o’er;
19907,BOOK XXIV.,"And rais’d a mound, and watch’d on ev’ry side,"
19908,BOOK XXIV.,From sudden inroad of the Greeks to guard.
19909,BOOK XXIV.,"The mound erected, back they turn’d; and all"
19910,BOOK XXIV.,"Assembled duly, shar’d the solemn feast"
19911,BOOK XXIV.,"In Priam’s palace, Heav’n-descended King."
19912,BOOK XXIV.,
19913,BOOK XXIV.,Such were the rites to glorious Hector paid.

19918,FOOTNOTES,
19919,FOOTNOTES,[1] The text of the original leaves it somewhat in doubt whether the
19920,FOOTNOTES,anger of the Greeks were directed against Thersites or Agamemnon. I
19921,FOOTNOTES,"believe the preponderance of authority, ancient and modern, is in"
19922,FOOTNOTES,favour of the former interpretation; but the latter is not without the
19923,FOOTNOTES,"support of some eminent scholars, and after much consideration I have"
19924,FOOTNOTES,been induced to adopt it. The original represents the Greeks as filled
19925,FOOTNOTES,with anger and resentment against some one. Thersites was an object of
19926,FOOTNOTES,"general contempt, but he had done nothing to excite those feelings:"
19927,FOOTNOTES,"indeed, apart from the offensiveness of his tone, the public sympathy"
19928,FOOTNOTES,"was with him; for the army was deeply dissatisfied, and resented the"
19929,FOOTNOTES,"conduct of Agamemnon against Achilles, mainly perhaps because they had"
19930,FOOTNOTES,ceased to be enriched with the plunder of his successful forays (see
19931,FOOTNOTES,"i. 202, and ix. 387). This dissatisfaction and resentment are referred"
19932,FOOTNOTES,"to by Neptune (xiii. 126), and by Agamemnon himself (xiv. 55). They"
19933,FOOTNOTES,had lately manifested themselves in the alacrity with which the whole
19934,FOOTNOTES,army had caught at the insidious suggestion of abandoning the war;
19935,FOOTNOTES,"and, just before the second assembly, Thersites avails himself of the"
19936,FOOTNOTES,"general feeling, constituting himself the representative of a popular"
19937,FOOTNOTES,"grievance, to vent his personal spite against Agamemnon. Ulysses saw"
19938,FOOTNOTES,how dangerous such a display might be at such a moment; and artfully
19939,FOOTNOTES,assuming (line 281) that the feeling was confined to Thersites alone
19940,FOOTNOTES,"(though in his subsequent speech, line 335, he admits and excuses the"
19941,FOOTNOTES,"general discontent), he proceeds to cut short its expression by"
19942,FOOTNOTES,"summary chastisement. Thereupon the fickle multitude, “despite their"
19943,FOOTNOTES,"anger” (against Agamemnon), cannot refrain from laughing at the signal"
19944,FOOTNOTES,discomfiture of their self-constituted champion.
