43,CANTO I,
44,CANTO I,"IN the midway of this our mortal life,"
45,CANTO I,"I found me in a gloomy wood, astray"
46,CANTO I,Gone from the path direct: and e'en to tell
47,CANTO I,"It were no easy task, how savage wild"
48,CANTO I,"That forest, how robust and rough its growth,"
49,CANTO I,"Which to remember only, my dismay"
50,CANTO I,"Renews, in bitterness not far from death."
51,CANTO I,"Yet to discourse of what there good befell,"
52,CANTO I,All else will I relate discover'd there.
53,CANTO I,"How first I enter'd it I scarce can say,"
54,CANTO I,Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh'd
55,CANTO I,"My senses down, when the true path I left,"
56,CANTO I,"But when a mountain's foot I reach'd, where clos'd"
57,CANTO I,"The valley, that had pierc'd my heart with dread,"
58,CANTO I,"I look'd aloft, and saw his shoulders broad"
59,CANTO I,"Already vested with that planet's beam,"
60,CANTO I,Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.
61,CANTO I,
62,CANTO I,"Then was a little respite to the fear,"
63,CANTO I,"That in my heart's recesses deep had lain,"
64,CANTO I,"All of that night, so pitifully pass'd:"
65,CANTO I,"And as a man, with difficult short breath,"
66,CANTO I,"Forespent with toiling, 'scap'd from sea to shore,"
67,CANTO I,"Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands"
68,CANTO I,"At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd"
69,CANTO I,"Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits,"
70,CANTO I,That none hath pass'd and liv'd.  My weary frame
71,CANTO I,"After short pause recomforted, again"
72,CANTO I,"I journey'd on over that lonely steep,"
73,CANTO I,
74,CANTO I,The hinder foot still firmer.  Scarce the ascent
75,CANTO I,"Began, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,"
76,CANTO I,"And cover'd with a speckled skin, appear'd,"
77,CANTO I,"Nor, when it saw me, vanish'd, rather strove"
78,CANTO I,To check my onward going; that ofttimes
79,CANTO I,With purpose to retrace my steps I turn'd.
80,CANTO I,
81,CANTO I,"The hour was morning's prime, and on his way"
82,CANTO I,"Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,"
83,CANTO I,"That with him rose, when Love divine first mov'd"
84,CANTO I,Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope
85,CANTO I,"All things conspir'd to fill me, the gay skin"
86,CANTO I,"Of that swift animal, the matin dawn"
87,CANTO I,"And the sweet season.  Soon that joy was chas'd,"
88,CANTO I,"And by new dread succeeded, when in view"
89,CANTO I,"A lion came, 'gainst me, as it appear'd,"
90,CANTO I,
91,CANTO I,"With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,"
92,CANTO I,That e'en the air was fear-struck.  A she-wolf
93,CANTO I,"Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem'd"
94,CANTO I,"Full of all wants, and many a land hath made"
95,CANTO I,Disconsolate ere now.  She with such fear
96,CANTO I,"O'erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall'd,"
97,CANTO I,"That of the height all hope I lost.  As one,"
98,CANTO I,"Who with his gain elated, sees the time"
99,CANTO I,"When all unwares is gone, he inwardly"
100,CANTO I,"Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,"
101,CANTO I,"Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,"
102,CANTO I,"Who coming o'er against me, by degrees"
103,CANTO I,Impell'd me where the sun in silence rests.
104,CANTO I,
105,CANTO I,While to the lower space with backward step
106,CANTO I,"I fell, my ken discern'd the form one of one,"
107,CANTO I,Whose voice seem'd faint through long disuse of speech.
108,CANTO I,"When him in that great desert I espied,"
109,CANTO I,"""Have mercy on me!"" cried I out aloud,"
110,CANTO I,"""Spirit! or living man! what e'er thou be!"""
111,CANTO I,
112,CANTO I,"He answer'd: ""Now not man, man once I was,"
113,CANTO I,"And born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both"
114,CANTO I,"By country, when the power of Julius yet"
115,CANTO I,Was scarcely firm.  At Rome my life was past
116,CANTO I,"Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time"
117,CANTO I,Of fabled deities and false.  A bard
118,CANTO I,"Was I, and made Anchises' upright son"
119,CANTO I,"The subject of my song, who came from Troy,"
120,CANTO I,When the flames prey'd on Ilium's haughty towers.
121,CANTO I,"But thou, say wherefore to such perils past"
122,CANTO I,Return'st thou?  wherefore not this pleasant mount
123,CANTO I,"Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?"""
124,CANTO I,"""And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,"
125,CANTO I,From which such copious floods of eloquence
126,CANTO I,"Have issued?""  I with front abash'd replied."
127,CANTO I,"""Glory and light of all the tuneful train!"
128,CANTO I,May it avail me that I long with zeal
129,CANTO I,"Have sought thy volume, and with love immense"
130,CANTO I,Have conn'd it o'er.  My master thou and guide!
131,CANTO I,Thou he from whom alone I have deriv'd
132,CANTO I,"That style, which for its beauty into fame"
133,CANTO I,"Exalts me.  See the beast, from whom I fled."
134,CANTO I,"O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!"""
135,CANTO I,
136,CANTO I,"""For every vein and pulse throughout my frame"
137,CANTO I,"She hath made tremble.""  He, soon as he saw"
138,CANTO I,"That I was weeping, answer'd, ""Thou must needs"
139,CANTO I,"Another way pursue, if thou wouldst 'scape"
140,CANTO I,"From out that savage wilderness.  This beast,"
141,CANTO I,"At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none"
142,CANTO I,"To pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:"
143,CANTO I,"So bad and so accursed in her kind,"
144,CANTO I,"That never sated is her ravenous will,"
145,CANTO I,Still after food more craving than before.
146,CANTO I,To many an animal in wedlock vile
147,CANTO I,"She fastens, and shall yet to many more,"
148,CANTO I,"Until that greyhound come, who shall destroy"
149,CANTO I,Her with sharp pain.  He will not life support
150,CANTO I,"By earth nor its base metals, but by love,"
151,CANTO I,"Wisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be"
152,CANTO I,The land 'twixt either Feltro.  In his might
153,CANTO I,"Shall safety to Italia's plains arise,"
154,CANTO I,"For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,"
155,CANTO I,"Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell."
156,CANTO I,He with incessant chase through every town
157,CANTO I,"Shall worry, until he to hell at length"
158,CANTO I,"Restore her, thence by envy first let loose."
159,CANTO I,"I for thy profit pond'ring now devise,"
160,CANTO I,"That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide"
161,CANTO I,"Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,"
162,CANTO I,"Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see"
163,CANTO I,"Spirits of old tormented, who invoke"
164,CANTO I,"A second death; and those next view, who dwell"
165,CANTO I,"Content in fire, for that they hope to come,"
166,CANTO I,"Whene'er the time may be, among the blest,"
167,CANTO I,Into whose regions if thou then desire
168,CANTO I,"T' ascend, a spirit worthier then I"
169,CANTO I,"Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,"
170,CANTO I,"Thou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,"
171,CANTO I,"Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,"
172,CANTO I,"Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,"
173,CANTO I,That to his city none through me should come.
174,CANTO I,"He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds"
175,CANTO I,"His citadel and throne.  O happy those,"
176,CANTO I,"Whom there he chooses!""  I to him in few:"
177,CANTO I,"""Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,"
178,CANTO I,I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse
179,CANTO I,"I may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,"
180,CANTO I,"That I Saint Peter's gate may view, and those"
181,CANTO I,"Who as thou tell'st, are in such dismal plight."""
182,CANTO I,
183,CANTO I,"Onward he mov'd, I close his steps pursu'd."
184,CANTO I,
185,CANTO I,
186,CANTO I,
187,CANTO I,
188,CANTO II,CANTO II
189,CANTO II,
190,CANTO II,"NOW was the day departing, and the air,"
191,CANTO II,"Imbrown'd with shadows, from their toils releas'd"
192,CANTO II,All animals on earth; and I alone
193,CANTO II,"Prepar'd myself the conflict to sustain,"
194,CANTO II,"Both of sad pity, and that perilous road,"
195,CANTO II,Which my unerring memory shall retrace.
196,CANTO II,
197,CANTO II,O Muses!  O high genius! now vouchsafe
198,CANTO II,Your aid!  O mind! that all I saw hast kept
199,CANTO II,"Safe in a written record, here thy worth"
200,CANTO II,And eminent endowments come to proof.
201,CANTO II,
202,CANTO II,"I thus began: ""Bard! thou who art my guide,"
203,CANTO II,"Consider well, if virtue be in me"
204,CANTO II,"Sufficient, ere to this high enterprise"
205,CANTO II,"Thou trust me.  Thou hast told that Silvius' sire,"
206,CANTO II,"Yet cloth'd in corruptible flesh, among"
207,CANTO II,"Th' immortal tribes had entrance, and was there"
208,CANTO II,"Sensible present.  Yet if heaven's great Lord,"
209,CANTO II,"Almighty foe to ill, such favour shew'd,"
210,CANTO II,"In contemplation of the high effect,"
211,CANTO II,"Both what and who from him should issue forth,"
212,CANTO II,It seems in reason's judgment well deserv'd:
213,CANTO II,"Sith he of Rome, and of Rome's empire wide,"
214,CANTO II,In heaven's empyreal height was chosen sire:
215,CANTO II,"Both which, if truth be spoken, were ordain'd"
216,CANTO II,"And 'stablish'd for the holy place, where sits"
217,CANTO II,Who to great Peter's sacred chair succeeds.
218,CANTO II,"He from this journey, in thy song renown'd,"
219,CANTO II,"Learn'd things, that to his victory gave rise"
220,CANTO II,And to the papal robe.  In after-times
221,CANTO II,"The chosen vessel also travel'd there,"
222,CANTO II,"To bring us back assurance in that faith,"
223,CANTO II,Which is the entrance to salvation's way.
224,CANTO II,"But I, why should I there presume?  or who"
225,CANTO II,"Permits it?  not, Aeneas I nor Paul."
226,CANTO II,"Myself I deem not worthy, and none else"
227,CANTO II,"Will deem me.  I, if on this voyage then"
228,CANTO II,"I venture, fear it will in folly end."
229,CANTO II,"Thou, who art wise, better my meaning know'st,"
230,CANTO II,"Than I can speak.""  As one, who unresolves"
231,CANTO II,"What he hath late resolv'd, and with new thoughts"
232,CANTO II,"Changes his purpose, from his first intent"
233,CANTO II,"Remov'd; e'en such was I on that dun coast,"
234,CANTO II,"Wasting in thought my enterprise, at first"
235,CANTO II,"So eagerly embrac'd.  ""If right thy words"
236,CANTO II,"I scan,"" replied that shade magnanimous,"
237,CANTO II,"""Thy soul is by vile fear assail'd, which oft"
238,CANTO II,"So overcasts a man, that he recoils"
239,CANTO II,"From noblest resolution, like a beast"
240,CANTO II,At some false semblance in the twilight gloom.
241,CANTO II,"That from this terror thou mayst free thyself,"
242,CANTO II,"I will instruct thee why I came, and what"
243,CANTO II,"I heard in that same instant, when for thee"
244,CANTO II,"Grief touch'd me first.  I was among the tribe,"
245,CANTO II,"Who rest suspended, when a dame, so blest"
246,CANTO II,"And lovely, I besought her to command,"
247,CANTO II,Call'd me; her eyes were brighter than the star
248,CANTO II,Of day; and she with gentle voice and soft
249,CANTO II,Angelically tun'd her speech address'd:
250,CANTO II,"""O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame"
251,CANTO II,"Yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!"
252,CANTO II,"A friend, not of my fortune but myself,"
253,CANTO II,On the wide desert in his road has met
254,CANTO II,"Hindrance so great, that he through fear has turn'd."
255,CANTO II,"Now much I dread lest he past help have stray'd,"
256,CANTO II,"And I be ris'n too late for his relief,"
257,CANTO II,"From what in heaven of him I heard.  Speed now,"
258,CANTO II,"And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,"
259,CANTO II,"And by all means for his deliverance meet,"
260,CANTO II,Assist him.  So to me will comfort spring.
261,CANTO II,I who now bid thee on this errand forth
262,CANTO II,Am Beatrice; from a place I come
263,CANTO II,
264,CANTO II,"(Note: Beatrice.  I use this word, as it is"
265,CANTO II,"pronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four"
266,CANTO II,"syllables, of which the third is a long one.)"
267,CANTO II,
268,CANTO II,"Revisited with joy.  Love brought me thence,"
269,CANTO II,Who prompts my speech.  When in my Master's sight
270,CANTO II,"I stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell."""
271,CANTO II,
272,CANTO II,"She then was silent, and I thus began:"
273,CANTO II,"""O Lady! by whose influence alone,"
274,CANTO II,Mankind excels whatever is contain'd
275,CANTO II,"Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb,"
276,CANTO II,"So thy command delights me, that to obey,"
277,CANTO II,"If it were done already, would seem late."
278,CANTO II,No need hast thou farther to speak thy will;
279,CANTO II,"Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth"
280,CANTO II,"To leave that ample space, where to return"
281,CANTO II,"Thou burnest, for this centre here beneath."""
282,CANTO II,
283,CANTO II,"She then: ""Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,"
284,CANTO II,"I will instruct thee briefly, why no dread"
285,CANTO II,Hinders my entrance here.  Those things alone
286,CANTO II,"Are to be fear'd, whence evil may proceed,"
287,CANTO II,"None else, for none are terrible beside."
288,CANTO II,"I am so fram'd by God, thanks to his grace!"
289,CANTO II,That any suff'rance of your misery
290,CANTO II,"Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire"
291,CANTO II,Assails me.  In high heaven a blessed dame
292,CANTO II,"Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief"
293,CANTO II,"That hindrance, which I send thee to remove,"
294,CANTO II,"That God's stern judgment to her will inclines."""
295,CANTO II,"To Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:"
296,CANTO II,"""Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid"
297,CANTO II,"And I commend him to thee.""  At her word"
298,CANTO II,"Sped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,"
299,CANTO II,"And coming to the place, where I abode"
300,CANTO II,"Seated with Rachel, her of ancient days,"
301,CANTO II,"She thus address'd me: ""Thou true praise of God!"
302,CANTO II,Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent
303,CANTO II,"To him, who so much lov'd thee, as to leave"
304,CANTO II,For thy sake all the multitude admires?
305,CANTO II,"Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,"
306,CANTO II,"Nor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,"
307,CANTO II,"Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?"""
308,CANTO II,"""Ne'er among men did any with such speed"
309,CANTO II,"Haste to their profit, flee from their annoy,"
310,CANTO II,"As when these words were spoken, I came here,"
311,CANTO II,"Down from my blessed seat, trusting the force"
312,CANTO II,"Of thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all"
313,CANTO II,"Who well have mark'd it, into honour brings."""
314,CANTO II,
315,CANTO II,"""When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes"
316,CANTO II,Tearful she turn'd aside; whereat I felt
317,CANTO II,"Redoubled zeal to serve thee.  As she will'd,"
318,CANTO II,"Thus am I come: I sav'd thee from the beast,"
319,CANTO II,Who thy near way across the goodly mount
320,CANTO II,Prevented.  What is this comes o'er thee then?
321,CANTO II,"Why, why dost thou hang back?  why in thy breast"
322,CANTO II,Harbour vile fear?  why hast not courage there
323,CANTO II,And noble daring?  Since three maids so blest
324,CANTO II,"Thy safety plan, e'en in the court of heaven;"
325,CANTO II,"And so much certain good my words forebode."""
326,CANTO II,
327,CANTO II,"As florets, by the frosty air of night"
328,CANTO II,"Bent down and clos'd, when day has blanch'd their leaves,"
329,CANTO II,Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems;
330,CANTO II,"So was my fainting vigour new restor'd,"
331,CANTO II,"And to my heart such kindly courage ran,"
332,CANTO II,That I as one undaunted soon replied:
333,CANTO II,"""O full of pity she, who undertook"
334,CANTO II,My succour! and thou kind who didst perform
335,CANTO II,So soon her true behest!  With such desire
336,CANTO II,"Thou hast dispos'd me to renew my voyage,"
337,CANTO II,That my first purpose fully is resum'd.
338,CANTO II,Lead on: one only will is in us both.
339,CANTO II,"Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord."""
340,CANTO II,
341,CANTO II,"So spake I; and when he had onward mov'd,"
342,CANTO II,I enter'd on the deep and woody way.
