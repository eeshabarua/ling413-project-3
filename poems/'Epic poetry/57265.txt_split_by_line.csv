13,,
14,,This book was transcribed from scans of several different copies of the
15,,original found at the Internet Archive. The typesetters of the original
16,,book represented the letter ā (with a macron above) as â (with
17,,"circumflex above) when italicized, but this etext uses the macron"
18,,throughout. Words in italics in this etext were italicized in the
19,,original book. I have corrected obvious misspellings (for example in one
20,,"place the word ""spices"" was used when ""spies"" was clearly meant) but"
21,,I’ve left variant spellings alone.

59,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
60,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
61,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,The immortal Epic of Valmiki is undoubtedly one of the gems of
62,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"literature,—indeed, some considering it as the Kohinur of the literary"
63,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"region, which has for centuries, and from a time reaching to the dim and"
64,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,far past been shedding unparalleled and undying halo upon the domain
65,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"presided over by ""the vision and the faculty divine."" The burthen of the"
66,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"bard’s song is the perpetual contest between good and evil,that is"
67,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"everywhere going on in this mysteriously-ordered world of ours,and which"
68,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"seemingly sometimes ending in the victory of the former,and at others in"
69,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"that of the latter,vitally and spiritually results in the utter"
70,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,overthrow and confusion of evil and in the triumph and final conquest of
71,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,good. Rāma sprung from the bright loins of the effulgent luminary of
72,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"day, and bringing his life and being from a long and illustrious"
73,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"ancestry of sovereigns, Rāma taking birth among the sons of men for"
74,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"chastising and repressing rampant Iniquity and Injustice, typifies the"
75,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"spirit of good that obtains in this world,—Rāvana, that grim and"
76,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"terrible Ten-headed one, a Rakshasa by virtue of birth, and worthy to be"
77,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,the chief and foremost of Rākshasas by virtue of his many misdeeds and
78,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"impieties, who challenges and keeps in awe the whole host of the"
79,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"celestials—""to whom the Sun did not shine too hot, and about whom the"
80,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"Wind did not dare to breathe,"" represents the spirit of unrighteousness"
81,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"and evil. Lakshmana, disregrading the pomp and splendours of princely"
82,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"life, to follow his beloved brother Rāma into the forest, and cheerfully"
83,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"undergoing there a world of trials and privations, and daily and nightly"
84,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,keeping watch and ward over his brother and his spouse in their
85,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"cottage,—and Bharata, stoutly and persistently declining, despite the"
86,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"exhortations of the elders and the spiritual guides, to govern the"
87,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"kingdom during Rāma’s absence in the forest, and holding the royal"
88,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"umbrella over his brother’s sandals,are personations of the _ne plus"
89,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"ultra_ of fraternal love, and consummate and perfect ideals of their"
90,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"kind. The righteous Bibhishana, who for Rāma’s cause forsook his royal"
91,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"brother, and set small store by the splendours of royalty, who suffered"
92,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,no earthly considerations to interfere with his entire and absolute
93,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"devotion to his friend, embodies in his person the sterling virtues"
94,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,going under the precious name of friendship. The ever-devoted Hanumana
95,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"glorying in the appellation of Rāma’s servant,—ever-prompt at the beck"
96,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,and call of his master to lay down his life—is the grandest and loftiest
97,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,conception of the faithful servant that is to be found in all
98,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"literature. Shall we say aught of Rāma and Sitā, or keep silence over"
99,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,themes too sacred for babblement and frofane mouthing? The kingdom is
100,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,astir and alive with the jubilations of the populace at the prospect of
101,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,Rāma’s coronation; pennons by thousands are streaming like meteors in
102,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,the air at the tops of stately edifices; and drums and _panavas_ and
103,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,other musical instruments are sounding forth the auspicious anouncement.
104,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,The royal household swims in a sea of bliss surging and heaving on all
105,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,sides. Delight and Joy move about and laugh and talk under the names of
106,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,Daçarātha and Kaucalya. Anon a thunder-clap bursts in the midst of the
107,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"Merry-making, and converts delight into dole, the sounds of laughter and"
108,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,hilarity into loud wails and lamentations issuing from hearts knowing no
109,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,consolation. All is lost! Rāma is to be banished into the woods for
110,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,fourteen years. He cheerfully makes up his mind and repairs to the
111,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,forest in consonance with his father’s promise. Sitā steps forth—a
112,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,divinity clad in flesh—Sitā would follow the fortunes of her lord. She
113,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"considers it as the height of undutifulness to remain behind, continuing"
114,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"to enjoy the pleasures of the palace, while her beloved Rāma is leading"
115,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,a life of toils and privations in the remote woods. The daughter as well
116,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"as the daughter-in-law of kings, brought up in the lap of luxury and"
117,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,amidst the soft ministrations of those pleasures that pertain to a royal
118,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"household, Sitā, the idol of every one’s love and regard, boldly and"
119,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"with alacrity faces all the toils and terrors of a forest-life, in"
120,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"preferance to remaining in Daçarātha’s residence, bereft of the company"
121,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,of her sweet lord.
122,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
123,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,All these and various other characters that figure on the fascinating
124,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"and enchanting boards of Valmiki, have been developed fully and"
125,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"elaborately, and with and perfect consistency of portraiture through the"
126,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,length of his gigantic poem of Rāmāyana. Rāvana standing before us in
127,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"stupendous proportions as the personation of terror and wrong-doing,"
128,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,before whom the human spirit trembles as Sitā in the Asoka wood; the
129,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"lotus-eyed Rāma self-forgetful and heroic, and possessed of the highest"
130,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"perfections that can adorn humanity, and through the extremes of misery"
131,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,and misfortune ever abiding by righteousness and truth; Sitā the best
132,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"and fairest of her sex, the embodiment of all loveliness and grace"
133,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"physical and mental, she who rose from the sacrificial fire of"
134,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,inspiration—a goddess in all her manifold perfections and unsurpassed
135,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"exellences, whose name carries in the very mention a world of pathos;"
136,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"the faithful Lakshmana, aye cleaving to his brother on the perilous edge"
137,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"of raging battle, and in the dreary forest leading a life lorn and"
138,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"desolate,—these and others whom we forbear reluctantly to name, have"
139,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,been pourtrayed to the life; they are quick with the Promethean spark
140,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,and occupy prominent positions in that ideal world brought into being by
141,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,those mighty intellectual wizards—the poets; and are the perennial
142,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"fountains of our joy and sorrow, never suffering the good and the"
143,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,beautiful to degenerate into cant and commonplace in our minds. Oh! the
144,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,privilege of genius.
145,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
146,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,The influence exercised by the Rāmāyana upon the Hindus reaching down to
147,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"the lowest strata of the society, is literally and in actual fact"
148,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,immense. Truly of the Rāmāyana it can be said in Baconian language that
149,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,it has come home to the business and bosoms of all men. If there is one
150,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,test which more than another distinguishes the true from the false in
151,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"Art, it is the circumstance of a work influencing or not influencing"
152,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,life: a work that assimilates itself with the mental constitution of a
153,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"nation, lending energy to impulse, contributing to clearness of thought,"
154,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"and ennobling and spiritualis- ing the higher emotions and aspirations,"
155,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"must by the very reason of its doing so, be true; while that which fails"
156,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"in doing so, is not the real and genuine thing and can well be spared."
157,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"The Rāmāyana has become a household-word in Hindu Society, and"
158,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"expressions embodying the memories of incidents celebrated in the epic,"
159,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"pass current amongst all ranks of the people, being mouthed alike by"
160,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"high and low, by prince and peasantry the aristocracy and the nobility"
161,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"of the land, by merchants and mechanics, by cultivators ploughing the"
162,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"field, and by shepherds keeping the flock, by princesses and high-born"
163,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"dames in towering edifices, and the women of the peasantry plying their"
164,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"daily tasks, religionists and politicians and men of letters,—in short"
165,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,by the community universally. Such absolute and all-commanding and
166,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,comprehensive sway and influence of literature is perhaps unknown in the
167,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"West, with the single exception of the Bible. _Rāma’s regime_ embodies"
168,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,the popular conception of administrative perfection—the ideal of a
169,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,monarchy. Rāvana is remembered not only in consequence of the prominent
170,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"part he plays in the Rāmāyana, but also on account of his famous advice"
171,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"to Rāma immediately before his death,—namely that the execution of evil"
172,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"projects should be deferred, but that good ones should be promptly"
173,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"executed,—a very sage counsel doubtless, answering partially to"
174,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,Macbeth’s observation on hearing of Macduff’s escape:
175,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
176,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"""—————From this moment"
177,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
178,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,The very firstlings of my heart shall be
179,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
180,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"The firstlings of my hand———"""
181,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
182,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"""The vow concerning the bow-breaking,"" applied sarcastically to a case"
183,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"of contumacy, ""The war between Rāma and Rāvana is matched by that war"
184,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"alone,"" ""Rāvana’s family."" ""Rāvana hath been ruined by domestic"
185,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"disclosure,"" ""Lankā hath met with destruction in consequence of excess"
186,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"of pride,"" ""That won’t render the Rāmāyana incorrect,""—these are some of"
187,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"the adages universally current in Hindu society, mixing constantly into"
188,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,common talk. Does not this unequivocally and unmistakably prove that the
189,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"influence of Valmiki has entered into the pith and marrow of the nation,"
190,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,and vitally sways its intellectual and emotional tendencies?
191,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
192,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,Sitā has become the grand exemplar to Hindu women as the embodiment of
193,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"purity, chastity, and wifely fidelity. She has furnished Hindu ladies"
194,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,with the highest and noblest conception of their duties in their various
195,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,and manifold relations in life. Her empire is both wide and deep over
196,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"the hearts of her sex, performing for their eternal behoof spiritual"
197,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,services of incalculable worth. She should be looked upon as one of the
198,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,greatest teachers of her kind—as a teacher in that highest and best
199,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"sense in which Christ and Chaitanya, Nanat and Socrates are called"
200,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"teachers. Ah, who can say how many women have turned away in the budding"
201,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"prime of youth from the primrose path of dalliance, and have in"
202,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"preferance followed virtue, who alone is truly fair,—how many stirred"
203,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,and influenced by the example of her matchless self-sacrifice have
204,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,firmly made up their minds to tread in her foot-steps? In like manner it
205,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"may be said of almost all the principal characters of the Rāmāyana, that"
206,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,they have more or less deeply influenced the thoughts and sentiments of
207,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,the people.
208,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
209,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"Further, the Rāmāyana has been all along a reservoir upon which"
210,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,subsequent writers have drawn ceaselessly. Indeed most of the succeeding
211,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,poems owe to the Mahabharata and the Rāmāyana for their subjects. Not to
212,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"mention writers of less note, even Kalidasa’s self has dunk deep of that"
213,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,fountain. Bhababhuti not less celebrated has composed a poem treating of
214,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,the latter part of Rāma’s life and saturated with a pathos which perhaps
215,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,no other pen has surpassed.
216,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
217,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"To the antiquary and the student of oriental literature and manners, a"
218,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,knowledge of the Rāmāyana is simply indispensable. Together with the
219,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"Mahabharata with which it is joined in popular parlance, and with which"
220,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"it goes hand in hand in compass and variety of information, but to which"
221,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,its superiority is pronounced in point of epic excellence and
222,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"consistency and uniformity of execution, the Rāmāyana constitutes the"
223,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"great repository of wisdom and learning, the manners and customs of the"
224,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"ancient Hindus. Indeed, the adage current in our socity with regard to"
225,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"the Mahabharata, ""What is not in _Bharat_ (Mahabharat), is not in"
226,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"_Bharat_ (India)"" applies to Ihe Rāmāyana as well. In it, cosmogony and"
227,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"theogony, the genealogies of kings and princes,—of human and extra-human"
228,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"beings, of _Ashuras_ and _Dānavas_, of _Yakshas_ and _Gandharvas_, and"
229,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"_Shiddhas_ and _Charanas_; folklore and anecdotes and legends, and"
230,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,stories half- mythical and half-historical; descriptions of cities
231,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"existing at a period long anterior to the age of Troy and Memphis, and"
232,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"the chronicles of kings that reigned before Priam and Busiris,—all these"
233,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"with others too numerous to enumerate, have been woven into the mighty"
234,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,web and woof of the magic drapery evolved by the so potent art of
235,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,Valmiki.
236,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
237,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,Nor is the poem less interesting in a political point of view. It can
238,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,hardly be questioned that all progress to be real and intrinsic must be
239,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,developed out of the inherent tendencies of a nation—the feelings and
240,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,sentiments and idiosyncracies into which it is born as well as those
241,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,which have been stamped on its life and mind by the stress and
242,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"exigencies of circumstances, social and political. For a nation,"
243,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"therefore, to govern another with such an object as that with which"
244,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"England has taken upon herself the Government of this country—namely,"
245,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,the progress and advancement of the children of the soil—a close and
246,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"wide study of its laws, and institutions manners and customs, modes of"
247,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,thought and emotional proclivities becomes a thing of paramount
248,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"interest. It is clear, hence, that to our rulers an acquaintance with"
249,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,such works as the Mahabharata and Rāmāyana is most important for wise
250,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,and beneficient adminstration. Nor can it avail one to advance the
251,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,seemingly unanswerable objection that treating of as they do a state of
252,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,society divided from the real present by a huge and abyssmal gulf of
253,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"time, such works can by no means serve as useful and faithful guides to"
254,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"the life and manners of Hindu society existing at this day. ""In India,"""
255,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"as Professor Monier Williams justly remarks, ""the lapse of centuries is"
256,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,powerless in effecting radical changes in the foundation and
257,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"constitution of Hindu society."" The conservative character of the Hindu"
258,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"nation is proverbial. In India usages and observances, the rituals"
259,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"prescribed by the scriptures and the customs sanctioned by hoary age,"
260,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,are clung to with a tenacity that is proof against time and innovation;
261,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,and those who think that England has materially swayed and influnced the
262,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"social life of the people, labour, we make bold to say, under a"
263,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,lamentable delusion.
264,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
265,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,Having regard alike to the surpassing and matchless excellence of the
266,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"poem itself both in its dramatic and lyric character, the extreme"
267,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,interest it possesses for antiquaries and students of oriental
268,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"literature, and the importance with which its study is fraught"
269,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"politically to Englishmen, it is most desirable that the Rāmāyana should"
270,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,be presented before the public in an English garb. In consequence of its
271,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"being composed originally in Sanskrit, it literally remains a sealed"
272,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,book to the majority of students. Few are the persons that can devote
273,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,their time and energies to master Sanskrit—a language which of all
274,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"languages existing on earth, is, in consequence of its highly complex"
275,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"and complicated grammar, as well as the indefiniteness which"
276,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"characterises it on account of its possessing countless synonyms, most"
277,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"difficult to master by a foreigner. Nay, we can perhaps safely go so far"
278,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,as to assert that very few amongst those Western scholars who have
279,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"devoted their lives to the study of Sanskrit literature, have been able"
280,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,to enter into the spirit of that part of its vocabulary in which are
281,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,couched those peculiarly Hindu ideas and sentiments that constitute the
282,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"unique genius of the people. To translate, therefore, such a work as the"
283,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,Rāmāyana from the dead and indefinite Sanskrit into the living and real
284,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"English, is, like unearthening a fossil and inspiring it with life; or"
285,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,rather like transferring a light from a bushel in which it has been
286,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"hidden, to a mountain- top,—so that men may behold it and the"
287,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"surrounding objects by help of its grateful rays. Surely, to render a"
288,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,work from a dead tongue into a living language and specially such a
289,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"language as English with all its resources, is literally taking it from"
290,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"its narrow and circumscribed sphere of influence, and placing it before"
291,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"the world at large—in fact, making it the common property and heritage"
292,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"of all mankind. The utility, therefore, we flatter ourselves, of this"
293,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"present literary undertaking, will recomend itself to all thinking-minds"
294,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"without any further elaboration on our part. Indeed, it would argue no"
295,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"common hardihood in him who despite common sense and reason, would"
296,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,endevour to maintain that the Epic of Valmiki published in an English
297,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,garb (always provided that the execution do not fall far short of the
298,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,requirements) would prove valueless as a contribution to the case of
299,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,literature and culture.
300,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,
301,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"In translating the Rāmāyana into English, we are concerned with a work"
302,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,composed by an illustrious ascetic passing his days in a hermitage in
303,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,devout contemplation and the practice of rigid austerities and
304,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"self-denial. It behoves us, therefore, to approach the task in a"
305,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"becoming spirit, with minds duly prepared and fitted. Let us,"
306,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"accordingly, begin by invoking Him whose presence can convert the"
307,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"foulest and the most unclean spot, pure and clean, ""like the icicle that"
308,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"hangs on Dian’s temple,"" or the hearts and aspirations of the Vestal"
309,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"Virgins, or pious saints ever engaged in meditating the Most High. May"
310,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,He in His infinite and eternal grace vouchsafe to purge our minds of all
311,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"ignoble feelings and motives,—may He enable is to find delight in duty"
312,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,and doing His will! May our energies never flag while carrying the
313,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,burden we have taken on our shoulders! May He enlighten our
314,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,understanding to interpret aright and convey in clear and adequate
315,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"language the great thoughts and sentiments of the sublime bard,—so that"
316,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,the English Rāmāyana being read by all the subjects of a Monarch on
317,THE RĀMĀYANA IN AN ENGLISH GARB.,"whose dominions the sun never sets, it may contribute to their constant"

585,SECTION I.,"son Rāma. In pursuance of his father’s promise, and with the view of"
586,SECTION I.,"compassing the pleasure of Kaikeyi, that heroic one, commanded by his"
587,SECTION I.,"sire, wended into the forest. And on the eve of his departure for the"
588,SECTION I.,"forest, that enhancer of Sumitrā’s joy and favorite of his brother"
589,SECTION I.,"(Rāma), his dear brother Lakshmana, endowed with humility, displaying"
590,SECTION I.,"brotherliness, followed him out of affection. And as Rohini followeth"
591,SECTION I.,"the moon, Rāma’s beloved spouse, sprung in Janaka’s line—like unto an"
592,SECTION I.,"embodiment of Divine power— dear (unto Rāma) as life itself, and engaged"
593,SECTION I.,"in acts of good, and furnished with every auspicious mark, and the best"
594,SECTION I.,"of wives, followed Rāma. Having been followed far by his father"
595,SECTION I.,"Daçarātha along with the citizens, Rāma met with the virtuous and"
596,SECTION I.,"beloved king of the Nishādas; and then in company with Guha,"
597,SECTION I.,"Lakshmana,and Sitā, dismissed his charioteer on the banks of the Ganges"
598,SECTION I.,"at Sringaverapura. Then wending from one wood to another, and having"
599,SECTION I.,"crossed many broad rivers, they, in accordance with Bharadwāja’s"
600,SECTION I.,"directions, arrived at the Chitrakuta; and constructing a romantic"
601,SECTION I.,"abode, the three began to live there as they listed. And they spent"
602,SECTION I.,"their days in delight, even like gods and Gandharbhas. And when Rāma had"
603,SECTION I.,"reached the Chitrakuta, king Daçarātha, distressed on account of his"
604,SECTION I.,"son, went to heaven, bewailing the latter. And when Daçarātha had"
605,SECTION I.,"ascended heaven, the mighty Bharata, although pressed by the Brāhmanas"
606,SECTION I.,"headed by Vasistha, to rule the kingdom, did not wish for dominion. And"
607,SECTION I.,"that hero went after Rāma into the forest, with the view of propitiating"
608,SECTION I.,"that worshipful one. And having come to the high- souled Rāma, with"
609,SECTION I.,"truth for his prowess, he besought his brother, with every mark of"
610,SECTION I.,"respect. And Rāma said unto Bharata these words,—""Thou too, O thou"
611,SECTION I.,"conversant with duty, art king."" And the exceedingly generous,"
612,SECTION I.,illustrious and mighty Rāma of a cheerful countenance did not wish for
613,SECTION I.,"the kingdom, in consonance with his father’s injunction. And having made"
614,SECTION I.,"over unto Bharata, as his substitute on the throne, his own sandals,"
615,SECTION I.,"Bharata’s elder brother repeatedly forbade him. And then Bharata,finding"
616,SECTION I.,"his desire not obtained,touched Rāma’s feet, and began to rule at"
617,SECTION I.,"Nandigrāma, expecting the return of Rāma. And when the auspicious"
618,SECTION I.,"Bharata, firm in promise and of subdued sense, had gone away, Rāma again"
619,SECTION I.,"perceiving there the influx of citizens and others, eagerly entered"
620,SECTION I.,"Dandaka. And having entered that mighty forest, the lotus-eyed Rāma slew"
621,SECTION I.,"the Rākshasa, Virādha, and saw Sarabhanga, Suitikshna, Agastya and"
622,SECTION I.,"Agastya’s brother. And he then, directed by Agastya, gladly possessed"
623,SECTION I.,"himself of Indra’s bow, the inexhaustible arrows, the scimitar, and the"
624,SECTION I.,"quiver. And while Rāma was dwelling there with the rangers of woods, the"
625,SECTION I.,sages came to him in a body for the destruction of the Asuras and
626,SECTION I.,Rākshasas. Thereupon in the presence of those ascetics like unto flaming
627,SECTION I.,"fire, inhabiting the Dandaka forest, he promised to slay those Rākshasas"
628,SECTION I.,"in battle. And it was while he was living there that, that dweller of"
629,SECTION I.,"Janasthāna, the Rākshasi Surpanakhā, capable of assuming any form at"
630,SECTION I.,"will, was disfigured. And it was while living there in the society of"
631,SECTION I.,"the inhabitants of Janasthāna, that Rāma slew in battle the Rākshasas"
632,SECTION I.,"Khara and Tricira and Dushana, together with their followers, who all"
633,SECTION I.,had been stirred up by the words of Surpanakhā. And fourteen thousand
634,SECTION I.,Rikshasas were slain in that battle. And learning of the destruction of
635,SECTION I.,"his relatives, Rāvana wrought into frenzy by anger, sought the aid of a"
636,SECTION I.,Rakshasa named Māricha. And although strongly dissuaded by
637,SECTION I.,"Māricha,saying ""Thou ought not to enter into hostilities with that"
638,SECTION I.,"powerful one. Do thou, therefore, O Rāvana, excuse me!"" Yet,"
639,SECTION I.,"disregarding those words of his, Rāvana, urged on by Fate, went into"
640,SECTION I.,that asylum in company with Māricha. And that one (Māricha) commanding
641,SECTION I.,"illusions, having drawn far the king’s sons (Rāma and Lakshmana) he"
642,SECTION I.,"(Rāvana) carried away Rāma’s wife, slaying the vulture Jatāyu. And"
643,SECTION I.,beholding the vulture slain and learning of the carrying off of
644,SECTION I.,"Mithilā’s daughter, the descendant of Raghu, deprived of sense, bewailed"
645,SECTION I.,"in grief. And having with unassuaged sorrow burnt the vulture Jatayu, as"
646,SECTION I.,"he was searching for Sitā in that wood, he fell in with a Rākshasa,"
647,SECTION I.,"Kāvandha by name, of a dreadful and deformed shape. Having slain him,"
648,SECTION I.,"the mighty-armed one burnt his body,—and thereupon he went to heaven."
649,SECTION I.,"And the Rākshasa addressed Rāma, saying, ""Do thou, O descendant of"
650,SECTION I.,"Raghu, repair unto the female ascetic, Savari, conversant with all"
651,SECTION I.,"systems of morality."" Reparing to Savari, that destroyer of foes, gifted"
652,SECTION I.,"with exceeding energy, Rāma, the son of Daçarātha, highly honored by"
653,SECTION I.,"Savari, met with Hanumān on the banks of the Pampā. Then, agreeably to"
654,SECTION I.,"Hanumān’s advice, the exceedingly powerful Rāma saw Sugriva and detailed"
655,SECTION I.,"unto him all, specially touching Sitā. Then the monkey Sugriva, having"
656,SECTION I.,"heard all from Rāma, was well pleased with Rāma and in the presence of"
657,SECTION I.,"fire, made friends with him. Then the king of monkeys, out of"
658,SECTION I.,"friendship, mournfully related unto him all about his hostilities with"
659,SECTION I.,Vāli. And then Rāma vowed that he would slay Vāli. Thereupon the monkey
660,SECTION I.,"described unto Rāghava the prowess of Vāli, and he feared lest Rāma"
661,SECTION I.,should not prove a match for Vāli. And with the view of convincing
662,SECTION I.,"Rāghava (as to Vāli’s might), Sugriva showed unto him the huge corpse of"
663,SECTION I.,"Dundabhi, resembling a large hill. And looking at the skeleton, Rāma"
664,SECTION I.,"endued with exceeding prowess, smiling the while, with his toe cast it"
665,SECTION I.,off at the distance of full ninety miles. And with a single mighty shaft
666,SECTION I.,"he pierced seven palmyra palms, a hill, and the sixth nether world,"
667,SECTION I.,"carrying conviction into Sugriva. Thus convinced, the mighty monkey well"
668,SECTION I.,pleased went with Rāma towards the cave called Kishkinda. And having
669,SECTION I.,"arrived there, that best of monkeys Sugriva of a tawney and golden hue,"
670,SECTION I.,"set up loud roars. And at those mighty sounds, out came the lord of"
671,SECTION I.,"monkeys and having obtained Tāra’s consent, came before Sugriva for"
672,SECTION I.,"battle. Then Rāghava killed Vāli on the spot with a single shaft. And,"
673,SECTION I.,"in compliance with Sugriva’s request, having slain Vāli in battle,"
674,SECTION I.,Rāghava conferred the kingdon on Sugriva. Then that best of monkeys
675,SECTION I.,"having summoned all the various monkeys, sent them in various directions"
676,SECTION I.,it search of Janaka’s daughter. Then at the suggestion of the vulture
677,SECTION I.,"Sampāti, the mighty Hanumān crossed the salt sea extending for a hundred"
678,SECTION I.,"_yojanas_. And arriving at the city of Lankā, ruled by Rāvana, he found"
679,SECTION I.,"Sitā in the midst of an Asoka wood, absorbed in thought. And then having"
680,SECTION I.,"shown her the sign, he related unto her all about the friendship between"
681,SECTION I.,"Rāma and Sugriva, and having cheered Videha’s daughter, he smashed the"
682,SECTION I.,"gate of the palace. Then having slain five generals, and seven"
683,SECTION I.,"counsellors’ sons, and grinded the heroic Aksha, he was bound fast (by"
684,SECTION I.,the arms of Indrajit). Then knowing that in virtue of the grand-sire’s
685,SECTION I.,"boon, he was free, he forgave those Rākshasas that were leading him (to"
686,SECTION I.,"Rāvana). Then having burnt down the city of Lankā, with the exception of"
687,SECTION I.,"the place occupied by Mithila’s daughter, the mighty one returned, with"
688,SECTION I.,the intention of delivering the glad tidings unto Rāma. And that one of
689,SECTION I.,"immeasurable soul having come before the high souled Rāma, and circled"
690,SECTION I.,"him, addressed him, saying,—""I have truly seen Sitā."" Then accompanied"
691,SECTION I.,"by Sugriva, Rāma repaired to the shore of the mighty ocean, and with"
692,SECTION I.,"shafts resembling the sun, vexed the deep. Then that lord of rivers—the"
693,SECTION I.,"Ocean—showed himself. And agreeably to the advice of the Ocean, Nala"
694,SECTION I.,constructed a bridge (over the water). By that bridge Rāma went to the
695,SECTION I.,"city of Lankā,—and slew Rāvana in battle. And having recovered Sitā,"
696,SECTION I.,Rāma experienced high shame (in consequence of Sitā’s having lived so
697,SECTION I.,"long in Rāvana’s place), and used harsh language towards Sitā in the"
698,SECTION I.,"presence of all. Incapable of hearing it, the chaste Sitā entered"
699,SECTION I.,"flaming fire. Thereupon assured by Agni as to the sinlessness of Sitā,"
700,SECTION I.,"Rāma became exceedingly pleased, and was honored by all the deities. And"
701,SECTION I.,"at the great act of Rāma’s, the three worlds with all that was mobile"
702,SECTION I.,"and immobile in them, as well as the sages and gods, were well pleased"
703,SECTION I.,with the mighty-souled Rāghava. Then installing that foremost of
704,SECTION I.,"Rākshasas, Bibhisana, on the throne of Lankā, Rāma was perfectly easy,"
705,SECTION I.,"and rejoiced exceedingly. Then Rāma, obtaining a boon from the"
706,SECTION I.,"celestials, revived the monkeys fallen in battle, and surrounded by"
707,SECTION I.,"friends, set out for Ayodhyā on the car Pushpaka. And repairing to"
708,SECTION I.,"Bharadwāja’s hermitage, Rāma, having truth for his prowess, despatched"
709,SECTION I.,"Hanumān to Bharata. Then talking over past affairs, accompanied with"
710,SECTION I.,"Sugriva, Rāma, mounted on the Pushpaka, departed for Nandigrama. Having"
711,SECTION I.,"arrived at Nandigrama, the sinless Rāma sheared himself of his matted"
712,SECTION I.,"locks along with his brothers, and, laving regained Sitā, got back his"
713,SECTION I.,"kingdom. And Daçarātha’s son, the auspicious Rāma, lord of Ayodha, hath"
714,SECTION I.,"been ruling those happy subjects of his, even like a father. (During his"
715,SECTION I.,"reign) his subjects will enjoy happiness, and contentment, and become"
716,SECTION I.,"hale, and grow in righteousness, and be devoid of mental disquietude and"
717,SECTION I.,"disease, and free from the fear of famine. And no person is to witness"
718,SECTION I.,"his son’s death, and women will be ever chaste, and never bear"
719,SECTION I.,"widowhood. And no fear of conflagration (will exercise people), nor"
720,SECTION I.,"creatures be drowned in water. And no danger will come from the wind,"
721,SECTION I.,"—nor any suffer from fever. And no fear will come from hunger, Or from"
722,SECTION I.,thieves. And cities and provinces will be filled with corn and wealth.
723,SECTION I.,"And all will live happily as at the Golden age, And having performed"
724,SECTION I.,"with countless gold an hundred horse sacrifices, and bestowed with due"
725,SECTION I.,"rites _ayutas_ and _kotis_² of kine on learned persons, and countless"
726,SECTION I.,"wealth on famous Brāhmanas, Rāghava will establish an hundred royal"

750,SECTION II.,"having received due honors, the celestial asking for and receiving"
751,SECTION II.,"permission (to depart), went to the etherial regions. And when Nārada"
752,SECTION II.,"had left for the celestial regions, that holy person went to the banks"
753,SECTION II.,of the Tamasā hard by the Jahnavi. And having arrived at the banks of
754,SECTION II.,"that river, the pious one, observing a holy spot devoid of mud, spoke"

756,SECTION II.,"spot devoid of mud. And it is beautiful, and contains pleasant waters,"
757,SECTION II.,"even like the minds of good men. Do thou, child, put down thy pitcher,"
758,SECTION II.,"and give me my bark. I will bathe even in this Tamasā, the best of holy"

760,SECTION II.,"intent upon serving his spiritual guide, presented the sage his bark."
761,SECTION II.,"And that one of subdued senses, having received his bark from his"
762,SECTION II.,"disciple, began to range around, surveying that extensive forest. In the"
763,SECTION II.,"vicinity of the wood, that worshipful one espied a pair of Kraunchas,"
764,SECTION II.,"emitting melodious notes, and ranging around in perfect peace of mind."
765,SECTION II.,"At this juncture, a wicked-minded fowler, singling out the male without"
766,SECTION II.,"any cause of hostility, slew him in the very presence of the holy man."
767,SECTION II.,"And observing him struggling on the earth, bathed in blood his help-mate"
768,SECTION II.,"began to bewail in piteous accents, at the prospect of her separation"
769,SECTION II.,"from her copper-crested oviparous husband, engaged in sport with"
770,SECTION II.,extended plumage. Finding the oviparous one thus brought down by the
771,SECTION II.,"fowler, the piety of that pious and righteous-souled Rishi was excited"
772,SECTION II.,"exceedingly. Then considering it to be an unrighteous deed, with a heart"
773,SECTION II.,"moved with pity, that twice-born one, beholding the weeping Kraunchi,"
774,SECTION II.,"spoke these words,—""O fowler, since thou hast slain one of a pair of"
775,SECTION II.,"Kraunchas, thou shalt never attain prosperity!"" Having uttered this, he"
776,SECTION II.,"thought within himself, ""What is this that I have said, afflicted with"
777,SECTION II.,"grief for the bird?"" Revolving thus in his mind, that highly-wise one"
778,SECTION II.,"and best of sages addressed his disciple, saying,—""This speech that I"
779,SECTION II.,have uttered is of equal feet and accents; and is capable of being
780,SECTION II.,chaunted according to measure to stringed accompaniment. Let it
781,SECTION II.,"therefore go forth as a _sloka_ as it has come out of my sorrow!"" When"
782,SECTION II.,"the sage had spoken thus, his disciple, well pleased, assented to his"
783,SECTION II.,excellent speech; and thereat that pious person was gratified. Then
784,SECTION II.,"having duly performed his ablutions at that holy spot, the reverend sage"
785,SECTION II.,"retraced his steps, pondering over the incidents touching the _sloka_."
786,SECTION II.,"And his disciple also, accomplished in learning, and of I meek"
787,SECTION II.,"demeanour, followed Valmiki, carrying on his back a pitcher filled with"
788,SECTION II.,water.
789,SECTION II.,
790,SECTION II.,"Having entered the hermitage along with his disciple, that one knowing"
791,SECTION II.,"duty, while apparently engaged in diverse kinds of talk, revolved in his"
792,SECTION II.,mind the circumstances connected with the verses. And it came to pass
793,SECTION II.,"that desirous of seeing the best of sages, there arrived that lord and"
794,SECTION II.,"creator of all, the effulgent Brahmā, furnished with four countenances."
795,SECTION II.,"Beholding him, Vālmiki rose up suddenly and, wondering greatly, humbly"
796,SECTION II.,and silently stood before him with folded hands. And duly bending low in

798,SECTION II.,"things for reception. And having sat down on a highly-honored seat, that"
799,SECTION II.,worshipful one enquired after the welfare of that sage Vālmiki knowing
800,SECTION II.,no deterioration; and then asked him to be seated. And having been
801,SECTION II.,"seated in the presence of the Grand-sire of all, Vālmiki, his mind"
802,SECTION II.,"running upon the self-same subject, became plunged in thought. ""What a"
803,SECTION II.,"sin hath been committed by that wicked-minded one, incited by hostile"

805,SECTION II.,"thereupon, again lamenting that female Krauncha, he, in grief of heart,"
806,SECTION II.,"mentally recited those verses. Then smiling, Brahmft spoke unto that"
807,SECTION II.,"excellent sage,—""Those verses of thine which thou hast composed shall"
808,SECTION II.,attain celebrity: no doubt need be entertained on this head. It is
809,SECTION II.,"because I had intended so, that those verses had come out of thy lips."
810,SECTION II.,"Do thou now, O best of saints, compose the entire history of Rāma. Do"
811,SECTION II.,thou relate unto the world the history of the righteous-souled and

820,SECTION II.,"long as this story of Rāmāyana shall retain currency, thou shalt reside"
821,SECTION II.,"both in this world and in mine."" Having said this, the worshipful Brahmā"
822,SECTION II.,disappeared there. And thereat the sage and his disciples marvelled
823,SECTION II.,"greatly. And his disciples sang those verses again and again; and,"
824,SECTION II.,"momentarily experiencing pleasure, said unto him with exceeding"
825,SECTION II.,"wonder,—""Those verses, composed of equal accents, and furnished with"
826,SECTION II.,"four parts, have been sung by the mighty saint, have, in virtue of"
827,SECTION II.,"frequent repetition, been associated with a world of pathos, and have"
828,SECTION II.,attained the eminence of a _sloka_. And now it is the intention of that

831,SECTION II.,
832,SECTION II.,The great ascetic Vālmiki of gracious appearance and unparalleled renown

847,SECTION III.,"himself facing the east on a cushion of _kusa_ grass, and sipping water"
848,SECTION III.,"according to the ordinance, he addressed himself to the contemplation of"
849,SECTION III.,"the subject through _yoga_. And by virtue of his _yoga_ powers, he"

931,SECTION IV.,"When Rāma had obtained his kingdom, that worshipful sage Vālmiki,"
932,SECTION IV.,composed the entire history [of that hero] in excellent metre and
933,SECTION IV.,"fraught with high meaning, saint recited twenty-four thousand _slokas_;"
934,SECTION IV.,"and it consists of five hundred sections, and is divided into six"
935,SECTION IV.,"_Kandas_ with the Uttara. And having composed it, including as well fut"
936,SECTION IV.,"incidents to happen afterwards, that lord reflected as to who should"
937,SECTION IV.,publish the same before assemblies. And as that great sage of purified
938,SECTION IV.,"soul was thus pondering, in came Kusi and Lava, in the guise of the sons"
939,SECTION IV.,"of ascetics, and touched his feet. And he found those illustrious"
940,SECTION IV.,"princes, the brothers Kusi and Lava, knowing morality, and living in a"
941,SECTION IV.,"hermitage, and endowed with sweet voices,—apt at taking in the meaning"
942,SECTION IV.,"of poetry. And finding them of a retentive endowment, and initiated into"
943,SECTION IV.,"Vedic studies, that lord taught them how to interpret the Vedas, and"
944,SECTION IV.,"that vow-observing one taught them the great Rāmāyana in full, treating"
945,SECTION IV.,"of Sitā’s life, and the destruction of Paulastya. And those sweet voiced"
946,SECTION IV.,"brothers, resembling Gandharbas in grace, accomplished in music and"
947,SECTION IV.,"dancing, and cognizant of _Sthana_ and _Murchhana_, began to chant this"
948,SECTION IV.,"poem delightful in recitation and in singing, set in three measures, and"
949,SECTION IV.,"seven notes, and sung according to time to the accompaniment of stringed"
950,SECTION IV.,"instruments, and fraught with the sentiments of love, pathos,"
951,SECTION IV.,"risibility, the irascible, the terrible, and the heroic. And knowing the"
952,SECTION IV.,"characteristics that go to make up the Drama, and gifted with"
953,SECTION IV.,"mellifluous voices, those blameless princes, coming from Rāma’s body,"
954,SECTION IV.,"and resembling him, even as the reflection of the solar or the lunar"
955,SECTION IV.,"disc resembles that disc, got by heart that excellent and moral story in"
956,SECTION IV.,"its entirety; and those princes versed in the Fine arts, with a"
957,SECTION IV.,"concentrated mind chanted it as they had learnt it, in the assemblies of"
958,SECTION IV.,ascetics and Brāhmanas and good men.
959,SECTION IV.,
960,SECTION IV.,"Once upon a time, those high souled and pious ones, furnished with every"
961,SECTION IV.,"auspicious mark, chanted this poem in an assembly of ascetics of"
962,SECTION IV.,"purified souls. Having heard this music, all the ascetics were seized"
963,SECTION IV.,"with surprise, and with eyes flooded with tears, exclaimed, ""Well done!"
964,SECTION IV.,"Well done!"" And well pleased, those saints cherishing Duty, praised the"
965,SECTION IV.,"praiseworthy Kusa and Lava as they sang, saying—""Ah! what charming"
966,SECTION IV.,"music! What sweetness of the verses! All this happened long ago, yet it"
967,SECTION IV.,"seems as if we saw it before us."" And unified with the theme, both of"
968,SECTION IV.,"them singing together sweetly, and at a high pitch, by means of _saraja_"
969,SECTION IV.,"and the other notes, they entranced the audience. And the two thus went"
970,SECTION IV.,"on sweetly singing at a high pitch, praised by those mighty sages"
971,SECTION IV.,priding in their asceticism. Some one in the assembly pleased with them
972,SECTION IV.,"presented them with a water-pitcher; and some one of high fame, being"
973,SECTION IV.,"delighted, made them a present of a bark garment; and some one gave them"
974,SECTION IV.,"a dark deer skin;—and some holy thread,—and some, a _kamandalu_³ and"
975,SECTION IV.,some great saint conferred on them a _maunja_⁴ made girdle; and some
976,SECTION IV.,"person granted them a _vrishi_,⁵ and some, a _kaupina_.⁶ And then some"
977,SECTION IV.,"ascetic, well-pleased, gave them an axe; and some, a red cloth; and"
978,SECTION IV.,"some, a thread for tying up their matted locks; and some gladly gave a"
979,SECTION IV.,"twine for binding faggots with,— and some, ascetic presented them with a"
980,SECTION IV.,"sacrificial pot; and some, a quantity of fire-wood; and some, a seat"
981,SECTION IV.,"made of _adumvari_⁷. And some exclaimed, ""Swasti;"" and some joyfully"
982,SECTION IV.,"cried,—""May ye be long-lived!"" And all those ascetics of truthful speech"
983,SECTION IV.,"conferred on them blessings. And the sages said,—""Wonderful is the"
984,SECTION IV.,"story! And, O ye accomplished in all kinds of music! beautifully have ye"
985,SECTION IV.,"chanted and finished this poem, charming ear and heart, and conferring"
986,SECTION IV.,"long life and prosperity,—which will afford themes to poets."" And"
987,SECTION IV.,"admired everywhere, on one occasion those singers were seen by Bharata’s"
988,SECTION IV.,"elder brother, in a street of Ayodhyā, sparsely scattered with stalls."
989,SECTION IV.,"And having had the brothers Kusa and Lava brought under his roof, that"
990,SECTION IV.,"destroyer of enemies, Rāma, accorded those ones worthy of honor, a"
991,SECTION IV.,respectful reception. And having seated himself on a throne of excellent
992,SECTION IV.,"gold, in the midst of his brothers and counsellors, that lord, Rāma,"
993,SECTION IV.,"beholding both the brothers, handsome and of modest demeanour, spoke"
994,SECTION IV.,"unto Lakshmana, Bharata and Satrughna, saying,—""Do ye listen to the"
995,SECTION IV.,"story, fraught with excellent sense and composed in excellent measure,"
996,SECTION IV.,"as sung by these ones endowed with the divine afflatus."" And then he"
997,SECTION IV.,ordered the singers to begin. Thereupon causing the down of the audience
998,SECTION IV.,"to stand on end, and ravishing their minds and hearts, they began to"
999,SECTION IV.,sing melodiously and distinctly and in as high a pitch as they could
1000,SECTION IV.,"command, and in strains rivalling the notes of a Vina. And that song of"
1001,SECTION IV.,"theirs enchanted the ear of that assembly. And Rāma said,—""Although"
1002,SECTION IV.,"these Kusa and Lava, of rigid penances, look like ascetics, yet they"
1003,SECTION IV.,"bear on their persons the signs of royalty. And, besides, the story"
1004,SECTION IV.,"conduces to my fame. Do ye, therefore, listen to that history fraught"
1005,SECTION IV.,"with great worth!"" And then commanded by Rāma, they began to chaunt"
1006,SECTION IV.,"according to the _Marga_ mode, and Rāma seated in the midst of his"
1007,SECTION IV.,"court, was drawn to the music, anxious for the perpetuation of his"

1026,SECTION V.,"with Prajāpati, and having Ikshwāku for their founder, who ruled the"
1027,SECTION V.,"entire earth as no other kings had done so before them, and in whose"

1030,SECTION V.,"entire history of that dynasty from the beginning. Do ye, with minds"
1031,SECTION V.,"free from ill will, listen to that story conferring merit, profit and"

1033,SECTION V.,
1034,SECTION V.,There is on the banks of the Sarayu a great and flourishing country
1035,SECTION V.,"called Kosala abounding in corn and wealth, in which the inhabitants"
1036,SECTION V.,passed their days pleasantly. And the capital of that country was
1037,SECTION V.,Ayodhyā famed among men which was founded by Manu himself—that foremost
1038,SECTION V.,of men. And that beautiful and mighty city was twelve _yojanas_ in
1039,SECTION V.,length and ten in breadth; and was intersected outside with spacious
1040,SECTION V.,"roads laid out orderly. And scattered with blown blossoms, and regularly"
1041,SECTION V.,"sprinkled with water, the well- arranged broad high-ways looked"
1042,SECTION V.,"beautiful. And that one bringing prosperity unto mighty kingdoms, King"
1043,SECTION V.,"Daçarātha, lived in that city, like unto the lord of the deities"
1044,SECTION V.,inhabiting the celestial regions. And the city was furnished with doors
1045,SECTION V.,"and gates, and well-arranged rows of shops. And it contained all kinds"
1046,SECTION V.,"of instruments and arms, and was inhabited by all classes of artizans."
1047,SECTION V.,And that graceful and matchlessly brilliant city abounded in eulogists
1048,SECTION V.,"and genealogists. And it was crowned with stately edifices with flags,"
1049,SECTION V.,and guarded by hundreds of _Sataghnis_⁸. And the mighty city contained
1050,SECTION V.,"theatres for females, and gardens, and mango-groves; and was enclosed by"
1051,SECTION V.,"a wall. And encircled by a deep moat, the city was accessible neither to"
1052,SECTION V.,"friend nor foe. And it abounded with elephants and horses, and kine and"
1053,SECTION V.,camels and asses. And it was thronged with neighbouring kings come to
1054,SECTION V.,"pay tribute, and inhabited by merchants from various countries, and"
1055,SECTION V.,"adorned with mountain-like palaces glittering with gems, and filled with"
1056,SECTION V.,"sporting-places for females, and like unto Indra’s Amaravāti. And the"
1057,SECTION V.,"city was wonderful to behold, gleaming with gold-burnished ornaments,"
1058,SECTION V.,"and inhabited by troops of courtezans, and abounding in all kinds of"
1059,SECTION V.,"gems, and graced with royal places. And it abounded in paddy and rice,"
1060,SECTION V.,and its water was sweet as the juice of the sugar-cane. And it resounded
1061,SECTION V.,with the sounds of _Dundubhis_ and _Mridangas_ and _Vinas_ and
1062,SECTION V.,_Panavas_. And that foremost spot of all the earth was like unto an
1063,SECTION V.,"aerial car obtained in heaven by the _Siddhas_, through force of ascetic"
1064,SECTION V.,"austerities, and thronged with the best specimens of humanity. And that"
1065,SECTION V.,city was filled by king Daçarātha with thousands of such Mahārathas⁹
1066,SECTION V.,"light-handed and accomplished in fight, as could by force of arms or"
1067,SECTION V.,sharpened shafts slaughter infuriated lions and tigers and boars roaming
1068,SECTION V.,in the forest; yet as would not pierce with arrows persons lorn or
1069,SECTION V.,abandoned or hiding or fugitive. And it abounded mostly in excellent
1070,SECTION V.,"Brāhmanas, lighting the sacrificial fire, and crowned with qualities,"
1071,SECTION V.,"and versed in the Vedas and the Vedāngas, and giving away thousands, and"
1072,SECTION V.,"ever abiding by truth, and high-souled, and resembling mighty ascetic."

1087,SECTION VI.,"inhabitants both rural and urban, an _Athiratha_¹⁰ in the Ikshwāku line,"
1088,SECTION VI.,"performing sacrifices, engaged in the performance of"
1089,SECTION VI.,"duties,self-controled like unto a _Maharshi_, a royal saint famed in the"
1090,SECTION VI.,"three worlds, possessed of strength, the destroyer of foes, having"
1091,SECTION VI.,"friends, of subdued senses, comparable unto Sakra and Vaisravana by"
1092,SECTION VI.,"virtue of accumulated riches and other possessions, and protecting"
1093,SECTION VI.,people even as the highly energetic Manu protected them. And as Indra
1094,SECTION VI.,"rules Amarāvati, that one firm in promise, and following duty, profit,"
1095,SECTION VI.,"and pleasure, ruled that best of cities. And in that excellent city, the"
1096,SECTION VI.,"men were happy and righteous-souled, and widely-read, and each contented"
1097,SECTION VI.,"with his possessions, and devoid of covetuousness, and speaking the"
1098,SECTION VI.,"truth. And in that prime of cities, there was none who had not at his"
1099,SECTION VI.,"command a plenteous supply of the good things, and there was no"
1100,SECTION VI.,"householder who was not well off in horses and kine, and corn and"
1101,SECTION VI.,"wealth. And one could see nowhere in Ayodhyā persons given up to lust,"
1102,SECTION VI.,"or unsightly, or crooked-minded, or unlettered, or atheistical. And all"
1103,SECTION VI.,"the men and all the women were of excellent character, and subdued"
1104,SECTION VI.,"senses and a happy frame of mind, and both in respect of occupation and"
1105,SECTION VI.,conduct spotless like unto _Maharshis_. And all wore ear-rings and
1106,SECTION VI.,"tiaras and garlands, and abundantly enjoyed the good things of life. And"
1107,SECTION VI.,"all were clean, daubing their limbs, and perfuming their persons, and"
1108,SECTION VI.,"feeding on pure food, and giving away, and wearing _Angadas_ and"
1109,SECTION VI.,"_Nishkas_¹¹ and hand-ornaments, and repressing passions And there were"
1110,SECTION VI.,"not in Ayodhyā persons not lighting the sacrificial fire, or not"
1111,SECTION VI.,"performing sacrifices, or mean-minded, or thieving, or engaged in"
1112,SECTION VI.,"improper occupations, or of impure descent. And the Brāhmanas of subdued"
1113,SECTION VI.,"senses were always engaged in the performance of their own duties,"
1114,SECTION VI.,"giving away in charity, and studying, and receiving gifts with"
1115,SECTION VI.,discrimination. And none of them was atheistical or untruthful or
1116,SECTION VI.,slenderly-read or detracting or incompetent or illiterate. And there was
1117,SECTION VI.,"no Brāhmana who was not versed in the Vedas and Vedāngas, or not"
1118,SECTION VI.,"observing vows, or not giving away by thousands, or poor-spirited, or of"
1119,SECTION VI.,"insane mind, or afflicted. And no man and no woman was seen devoid of"
1120,SECTION VI.,"grace or beauty, or lacking in reverence for their monarch. And the four"
1121,SECTION VI.,orders with Brāhmanas at their head contained persons serving gods and
1122,SECTION VI.,"guests, and endowed with gratitude, and munificent, and heroic, and"
1123,SECTION VI.,possessing prowess. And the men were long-lived; and ever abode by duty
1124,SECTION VI.,"and truth; and lived in that best of cities, always surrounded by sons"
1125,SECTION VI.,and grandsons and wives. The Kshatriyas were obedient unto the
1126,SECTION VI.,"Brāhmanas, and the Vaicyas followed the Kshatriyas, and the Sudras,"
1127,SECTION VI.,"occupied with their proper vocations, ministered unto the three other"
1128,SECTION VI.,"orders. And that city was ably governed by that lord of Ikshwāku’s line,"
1129,SECTION VI.,"even as that foremost of men, the intelligent Manu, had governed it"
1130,SECTION VI.,"before him. And as a mountain-cavern abounds with lions, it was filled"
1131,SECTION VI.,"with warriors resembling flaming fire, of straight ways, unforbearing,"
1132,SECTION VI.,and of accomplished learning. And the city abounded with excellent
1133,SECTION VI.,"horses sprung in Kāmvoja, and Vāhlika, and Vanāyu, and the banks of the"
1134,SECTION VI.,"Sindhu, and like unto that best of horse, Hari’s charge; and with fierce"
1135,SECTION VI.,"elephants sprung on the Vindha mountain, and the Himavat, filled with"

1139,SECTION VI.,"and Mriga, and from Mriga and Mandra,—superior like unto Airavata, and"
1140,SECTION VI.,"coming from Mahāpadma, Anjana, and Vāmana breeds; fierce, and looking"
1141,SECTION VI.,like hills. And that city was over two _yojanas_; and truly it was
1142,SECTION VI.,"called Ayodhyā.¹³ And repressing enemies, that city was governed by the"
1143,SECTION VI.,"great and the exceedingly powerful king Daçarātha, even as the Moon"

1168,SECTION VII.,"Dhrishti, and Vijaya, and Surāshtra, and Rāshtravardhana, and Akopa, and"

1172,SECTION VII.,"Suyajna,and Javali, and Kācyapa, and Gautama, and the long-lived"
1173,SECTION VII.,"Markandeya, and the regenerate Kātyāyana. Ever associated in counsel"
1174,SECTION VII.,"with these Brahmārshis, his priests and counsellors serving the dynasty"
1175,SECTION VII.,"from father to son, learned yet modest, and bashful, and conversant with"
1176,SECTION VII.,"policy, and of subdued-senses, and auspicious, and high-souled, and"

1181,SECTION VII.,employing spies noting what was doing or done in the midst of their own
1182,SECTION VII.,"or a hostile party. And they were adepts in intercourse with people, and"
1183,SECTION VII.,well-tried in friendship by the monarch. And they were ever busy in
1184,SECTION VII.,replenishing the exchequer and in levying troops. And they did not
1185,SECTION VII.,"cherish ill will even towards enemies, when innocent. And they were"
1186,SECTION VII.,"heroic, and ever high-spirited, following policy, and protecting those"
1187,SECTION VII.,"citizens that were pure, and not bearing ill will towards Brāhmanas and"
1188,SECTION VII.,"Kshatriyas, and filling the treasury, by inflicting punishments"
1189,SECTION VII.,according to the offences of the persons guilty. And during the time
1190,SECTION VII.,when those pure ones of one mind presided over the justice of the
1191,SECTION VII.,"kingdom, there was neither in the city nor the provinces any that was a"
1192,SECTION VII.,"liar, or wicked, or going after others’ wives. And peace reigned all"
1193,SECTION VII.,around the city and the provinces. And the ministers wore excellent
1194,SECTION VII.,"raiment, and ornaments, and were engaged in observing pure vows, and"
1195,SECTION VII.,"ever kept their eye of policy open, in the interests of the monarch. And"
1196,SECTION VII.,the king considered them as crowned with virtues; and they were famed on
1197,SECTION VII.,"account of their prowess, concluding unerringly in consequence of their"
1198,SECTION VII.,intelligence of other countries. And in all climes and times they could
1199,SECTION VII.,manifest their noble qualities; and they were cognizant of war and
1200,SECTION VII.,"peace, and possessed of goodness, passion and ignorance. And they could"
1201,SECTION VII.,"keep their counsel, and judge of things finely, and were well-versed in"
1202,SECTION VII.,"the art of policy, and ever fair-spoken. Surrounded by such counsellors"
1203,SECTION VII.,"endowed with various qualities, the faultless king Daçarātha ruled the"

1205,SECTION VII.,"protecting the subjects, and preserving the people, and not sacrificing"
1206,SECTION VII.,"his duties,—famed over the three worlds. And munificent, and firm in"
1207,SECTION VII.,"promise in battle, that best of men ruled there this earth. Nor did he"
1208,SECTION VII.,ever meet with a foe that was either his equal or superior. And
1209,SECTION VII.,"possessed of friends, and having obedient commanders, and extricating"

1222,SECTION VIII.,"him, the powerful and high-souled king, had no son capable of"
1223,SECTION VIII.,"perpetuating his line. And mentally turning the matter over, the"
1224,SECTION VIII.,"high-souled one thought, ""Why do I not celebrate a horse-sacrifice with"
1225,SECTION VIII.,"the intention obtaining a son?"" And that highly-energetic, pious and"
1226,SECTION VIII.,"intelligent monarch, in consultation with all his counsellors of sedate"
1227,SECTION VIII.,"minds, having made up his mind to celebrate the sacrifice, said unto"
1228,SECTION VIII.,"that best of counsellors, Sumantra,—""Do thou speedily summon my"
1229,SECTION VIII.,"spiritual guides, along with the family priests."" Thereupon, going out"
1230,SECTION VIII.,"speedily, Sumantra of swift movements called together all the spiritual"
1231,SECTION VIII.,"guides, as well as others versed in the Vedic ritual; _viz_., Suyajna,"
1232,SECTION VIII.,"and Vāmadeva, and Jāvāli, and Kācyapa, and Vasistha, and other principal"
1233,SECTION VIII.,"twice-born ones. And having paid homage unto them, the virtuous king"
1234,SECTION VIII.,"Daçarātha then spoke unto them these sweet words, consistent with duty"
1235,SECTION VIII.,"and interest, —""Ever pining on account of a son, I know no happiness,—"
1236,SECTION VIII.,therefore it is my intention that I should celebrate a horse sacrifice.
1237,SECTION VIII.,"I intend to celebrate it according to the ordinance. Do ye, therefore,"
1238,SECTION VIII.,"consider how I may attain my object."" Thereat, the Brāhmanas with"
1239,SECTION VIII.,"Vasistha at their head, exclaiming ing ""Well! Well!"" approved the words"
1240,SECTION VIII.,"that had fallen from the lips of the monarch. And exceedingly pleased,"
1241,SECTION VIII.,"they spoke unto Daçarātha saying,—""Do thou order the necessary articles,"
1242,SECTION VIII.,"loose the horse, and prepare the sacrificial ground on the north bank of"
1243,SECTION VIII.,"the Sarayu. And, O king, since with the intention of obtaining offspring"
1244,SECTION VIII.,"thou purposest so piously, thou wilt surely obtain sons after thy"
1245,SECTION VIII.,"heart."" And hearing these words of the regenerate ones, the king was"
1246,SECTION VIII.,"highly gratified. And with eyes expanded in delight, he spoke unto his"
1247,SECTION VIII.,"ministers,—""Do ye procure the necessary sacrificial articles, according"
1248,SECTION VIII.,to the injunction of my spiritual preceptors; and loose a horse
1249,SECTION VIII.,"protected by a competent person, and followed by one of the chief family"
1250,SECTION VIII.,priests; and do ye prepare the sacrifical ground on the north bank of
1251,SECTION VIII.,the Sarayu; and do ye in due order and according to the ordinance
1252,SECTION VIII.,perform the rites required to secure an uninterrupted completion to the
1253,SECTION VIII.,ceremony. This ceremony is incapable of being celebrated by every king.
1254,SECTION VIII.,Particular care should be taken that the sacrifice is not defective on
1255,SECTION VIII.,account of any serious omission; inasmuch as with learned
1256,SECTION VIII.,Brahmā-Rākshasas ever on the look-out to espy shortcomings in the
1257,SECTION VIII.,"ceremony, the performer thereof speedily perishes, should anything take"
1258,SECTION VIII.,place not consonant to the Ordinance. And do ye possessed of ability so
1259,SECTION VIII.,"arrange, that this sacrifice may be completed in harmony with the"
1260,SECTION VIII.,"ritual."" Thus addressed with due respect, the counsellors listened to"
1261,SECTION VIII.,"the words of the monarch, and said, ""So be it."""
1262,SECTION VIII.,
1263,SECTION VIII.,"Then taking the permission of that best of kings, those regenerate ones"
1264,SECTION VIII.,"knowing duty, having blessed the monarch, returned to their respective"
1265,SECTION VIII.,"quarters. And dismissing those Brāhmanas, the king spoke unto his"
1266,SECTION VIII.,"minister, saying, —""Do ye, even as the family priests have ordered,"
1267,SECTION VIII.,"arrange for the sacrifice!"" Having said this, that mighty-minded and"
1268,SECTION VIII.,"best of men dismissed his ministers, and himself entered into the inner"
1269,SECTION VIII.,"apartment. And coming there, that lord of men said unto his favourite"
1270,SECTION VIII.,"wives,—""Do ye know it for certain that in order to obtain a son I am"
1271,SECTION VIII.,"going to petform a sacrifice."" And hearing those sweet words, the"
1272,SECTION VIII.,"countenances of those shining dames looked resplendent, like lotuses"

1282,SECTION IX.,and to what I have heard myself! This horse-sacrifice is enjoined by the
1283,SECTION IX.,family priests; and I have myself heard the following story celebrated
1284,SECTION IX.,in ancient chronicle. And what the worshipful Sanat Kumāra had said
1285,SECTION IX.,"formerly in the presence of the saints, applies, O king, the case of thy"
1286,SECTION IX.,"having a son. ""Kācyapa hath a son known by the name of Bibhāndaka. He"
1287,SECTION IX.,will get a son called Rhishyasringa. And he will grow up and pass his
1288,SECTION IX.,days in the woods. And that foremost of Brāhmanas will not know aught
1289,SECTION IX.,"else save following his father. And, O king, it is rumoured abroad, and"
1290,SECTION IX.,"also always said by the Vipras, that that high-souled one will practise"
1291,SECTION IX.,the two modes¹⁴ of Brahmācharya life. And he will spend some time in
1292,SECTION IX.,"serving the sacrificial fire and his famous sire. At this time, the"
1293,SECTION IX.,powerful Romapāda of exceeding strength will be famed as king of the
1294,SECTION IX.,"Angas. And in consequence of some default on bif part, there will occur"
1295,SECTION IX.,"in his kingdom a terrible and dreadful drouth, capable of striking"
1296,SECTION IX.,"terror into all. And filled with grief on account of this drouth, the"
1297,SECTION IX.,"king will call about him Veda-accomplished Brāhmanas, and speak unto"
1298,SECTION IX.,"them, saying,—""Ye are conversant with the Vedic ritual and the social"
1299,SECTION IX.,"duties. Do ye, therefore, tell me how to expiate for this evil."" And"
1300,SECTION IX.,"thus accosted by the king, those excellent Brāhmanas versed in the"
1301,SECTION IX.,"Vedas, will say unto that ruler of earth,—""Do thou, O monarch, by all"
1302,SECTION IX.,"means, bring Bibhāndaka’s son. And having, O king, brought that Brāhmana"
1303,SECTION IX.,"versed in the Vedas, Bibhāndaka’s son Rhishyasringa, and duly honored"
1304,SECTION IX.,"him, do thou, O monarch with a concentrated mind, bestow upon him thy"
1305,SECTION IX.,"daughter Sāntā, according to the ordinance."" And hearing those words of"
1306,SECTION IX.,"theirs, the king will begin to think as to how he can bring over that"
1307,SECTION IX.,"one endowed with energy. Then in consultation with his counsellors, the"
1308,SECTION IX.,"prudent king having come to a conclusion, will, honoring them duly,"
1309,SECTION IX.,desire his priest and his courtiers to set out in quest of
1310,SECTION IX.,"Rhishyasriuga. Thereupon hearing the king’s words, with aggrieved"
1311,SECTION IX.,"hearts, and with heads hanging down, they will beseech the monarch,"
1312,SECTION IX.,"saying,—""Afraid of the saint, Bibhāndaka, we shall not be able to repair"
1313,SECTION IX.,"thither."" Anon hitting upon the appropriate means, they say,—’We will"
1314,SECTION IX.,"search for the Vipra, and no blame shall attach unto us.’—"
1315,SECTION IX.,
1316,SECTION IX.,"Thus by help of courtezans, the saint’s son was brought by the lord of"
1317,SECTION IX.,the Angas. And then the god (Indra) poured down showers; and the king
1318,SECTION IX.,conferred on him Sāntā. And now thy son-in-law Rhishyasringa will help
1319,SECTION IX.,thee in obtaining a son. Now I have related unto thee what Sanat Kumāra
1320,SECTION IX.,"had communicated."" Thereupon king Daçarātha, well pleased, spoke unto"
1321,SECTION IX.,"Sumantra,—""Do thou now tell me by what means Rhishyasringa was brought"
1322,SECTION IX.,"over (by the lord of the Angas)."""
1323,SECTION IX.,
1324,SECTION IX.,¹⁴ Those that assume the staff and the _kamandalu_ are reckoned the

1334,SECTION X.,thee how the counsellors brought Rhishyasringa. Do thou listen with thy
1335,SECTION X.,counsellors! The priest together with the counsellors spoke unto
1336,SECTION X.,"Romapāda, saying,— ’The means that we have hit upon can never fail of"
1337,SECTION X.,effect.’ Rhishyasringa hath been brought up in woods; and is engaged in
1338,SECTION X.,austerities and the study of the Vedas; and is ignorant of the pleasure
1339,SECTION X.,that ensueth from contact with women. By help of things agreeably
1340,SECTION X.,"ministering unto the senses, and ravishing the soul, we shall bring him"
1341,SECTION X.,"to the city. Do thou, therefore, arrange for them! Let courtezans of"
1342,SECTION X.,"comely presence, clad in ornaments, repair thither. And if well treated,"
1343,SECTION X.,"they will by various means bring him hither.’ Hearing this, the king"
1344,SECTION X.,"said unto the priest,—’So be it!’ and laid the charge upon him,—who,"
1345,SECTION X.,"however, made it over to the courtiers. And the latter acted"
1346,SECTION X.,accordingly.
1347,SECTION X.,
1348,SECTION X.,"And in accordance with the instructions, the courtesans entered that"
1349,SECTION X.,"great forest; and remaining at some distance from the hermitage,"
1350,SECTION X.,endeavoured to meet with the sober son of the saint ever dwelling in the
1351,SECTION X.,"woods. And satisfied with serving his sire, he never strayed from the"
1352,SECTION X.,"hermitage; and consequently had never seen men and women, or any other"
1353,SECTION X.,creatures living in cities and towns. And it came to pass that on one
1354,SECTION X.,"occasion, walking about at will, Bibhāndaka’s son came to that spot and"
1355,SECTION X.,"beheld the courtezans. And excellently attired, and singing in sweet"
1356,SECTION X.,"voices, the women said unto the saint’s son,—’Who art thou? And what"
1357,SECTION X.,"dost thou, O Brāhmana? We wish to learn all this. And why is it that"
1358,SECTION X.,thou rangest alone this far-off forest? Beholding these beautiful
1359,SECTION X.,"damsels never seen before, he from delight hastened to inform them of"
1360,SECTION X.,"his lineage, ’My father is Bibhāndaka; and I am his son, having sprung"
1361,SECTION X.,from his loins. My name is Rhishyasringa; and my occupation is known the
1362,SECTION X.,world over. And this auspicious hermitage hard by belongs to us; and
1363,SECTION X.,there I shall receive you all in due form.’ Hearing the words of the
1364,SECTION X.,"saint’s son, they all consented, and the women went to behold that"
1365,SECTION X.,"asylum. And when they had come there, the saint’s son received them"
1366,SECTION X.,"hospitably, saying,—’Here is _Arghya_,’ ’Here is water for washing the"
1367,SECTION X.,"feet,’ ’Here are fruits and roots.’ And thereupon they readily received"
1368,SECTION X.,"his hospitality. And actuated by the fear of the saint, Bibhāndaka, they"
1369,SECTION X.,"bent their minds upon departing soon. And they said,—’Do thou also, O"
1370,SECTION X.,"twice-born one, receive from us these excellent fruits! And, good betide"
1371,SECTION X.,"thee, O Vipra, do not tarry!’ And thereupon, embracing him joyfully,"
1372,SECTION X.,they gave unto him sweetmeats and various kinds of savoury viands. And
1373,SECTION X.,"tasting those things, that one of exceeding energy took them for fruits,"
1374,SECTION X.,"never tasted before by the dwellers of the forest. Then, having accosted"
1375,SECTION X.,"him, the women, feigning the observance of some vow, went away, inspired"
1376,SECTION X.,"with the fear of his father. And when they had gone, that twice-born"
1377,SECTION X.,"one, Kācyapa’s son, became sad, and from grief of heart went this way"
1378,SECTION X.,"and that. And the next day his mind momentarily running upon it, the"
1379,SECTION X.,"graceful son of Bibhāndaka, endowed with prowess, came to that spot"
1380,SECTION X.,"where he had encountered the comely courtezans, adorned with ornaments."
1381,SECTION X.,"And as soon as they observed him coming, they came forward, and said,—Do"
1382,SECTION X.,"thou, O Brāhmana, come unto our hermitage! There are in that asylum"
1383,SECTION X.,diverse kinds of fruits and roots; and there thou wilt surely feed thy
1384,SECTION X.,"fill. Thereupon, hearing those words of theirs capable of influencing"
1385,SECTION X.,"the heart, he became bent upon going,—and the women brought him away."
1386,SECTION X.,"And when that high-souled Vipra had been brought over, the good, Indra,"
1387,SECTION X.,"suddenly poured forth plenteous showers, enlivening the spirits of men."
1388,SECTION X.,"And when the ascetic had arrived, with showers, the king approached him"
1389,SECTION X.,"in humble guise, bending his head to the ground. And he offered him"
1390,SECTION X.,"_Arghya_,in due form, and with a collected mind; and asked for his"
1391,SECTION X.,"favor, so that wrath could not influence the Vipra. And taking him into"
1392,SECTION X.,"the inner apartments, and in due form conferring upon him in sober mood"
1393,SECTION X.,"his daughter Sāntā, the king became happy. Thus the highly powerful"

1404,SECTION XI.,"the line of Ikshwāku will be born a righteous king, named Daçarātha,"

1407,SECTION XI.,"highly pious daughter, Sāntā by name. And the (old) king of the Angas"

1413,SECTION XI.,"having pondered well, he will make over unto him Rhishyasringa of"
1414,SECTION XI.,"subdued senses, together with Sāntā and his children. And taking that"
1415,SECTION XI.,"Vipra, that king, his mind free from anxiety, with a glad heart, will"

1417,SECTION XI.,"desirous of fame, with the intention of obtaining offspring and heaven,"
1418,SECTION XI.,"with joined hands, will appoint that best of Brāhmanas, Rhishyasringa,"
1419,SECTION XI.,to conduct the ceremony. And that bringer of good will attain his object

1424,SECTION XI.,"repairing thither, accompanied with thy forces and equipage, thyself, O"
1425,SECTION XI.,"mighty king, bring Rhishyasringa over with due honors."" And hearing"
1426,SECTION XI.,"Sumantra’s words, Daçarātha was exceedingly delighted. After hearing"
1427,SECTION XI.,"these words, and permitted by Vasishtha, he, accompanied with the"
1428,SECTION XI.,"ladies, and his courtiers, set out for the place where that twice-born"
1429,SECTION XI.,"one was. And gradually passing by woods and fells, he arrived at the"
1430,SECTION XI.,place where that foremost of ascetics was. And coming before that best
1431,SECTION XI.,"of regenerate ones, he saw that sage’s son near Romapāda, like unto"

1615,SECTION XIV.,performed the _pravargya_ as well as the _upasada_ according to the

1617,SECTION XIV.,"the deities with glad hearts, those foremost of ascetics duly performed"
1618,SECTION XIV.,the morning ablutions and the other prescribed rites. The oblations of
1619,SECTION XIV.,"clarified butter first having been offered unto Indra, according to the"
1620,SECTION XIV.,"ritual, the king with a purified heart performed his ablutions. And then"
1621,SECTION XIV.,the mid-day ablutions took place in proper sequence. And those foremost
1622,SECTION XIV.,"of Brāhmanas, in due form, and according to the ordinance, officiated at"

1626,SECTION XIV.,"and soft mantras, duly invoking the dwellers of the celestial regions,"

1638,SECTION XIV.,various countries to the sacrifice of that high-souled one were
1639,SECTION XIV.,excellently entertained with meats and drinks. And the foremost

1645,SECTION XIV.,interval between the completion of one bath and the beginning of the
1646,SECTION XIV.,"next, mild and eloquent Vipras, desirous of victory, engaged in various"
1647,SECTION XIV.,"disputations. And every day in that sacrifice, skilful Brāhmanas,"
1648,SECTION XIV.,"engaged in the ceremony, did every thing, according to the ritual. And"
1649,SECTION XIV.,there was no twice-born one that was not versed in the Vedas and the
1650,SECTION XIV.,"Vedāngas, or that did not observe vows, or that was not profoundly"

1652,SECTION XIV.,"And when the time came for planting the _Yupas_, persons cognizant of"
1653,SECTION XIV.,"arts and sacrificial rites, prepared six _Yupas_ of _Vilwa_, as many of"
1654,SECTION XIV.,"catechu, and as many of _Palasa_, and one of _Sleshmataka_, and two of"
1655,SECTION XIV.,_Devadaru_ well-made and measuring two outstretched arms. Persons versed

1659,SECTION XIV.,"having eight angles, and smooth-faced were decked out in one and twenty"
1660,SECTION XIV.,"pieces of cloth, and were firmly planted with due ceremonies by"
1661,SECTION XIV.,"artizans. And being wrapped up in cloths, and worshipped with flowers,"
1662,SECTION XIV.,they looked like the seven Rishis appearing in the welkin. And an
1663,SECTION XIV.,adequate number of bricks was also duly made (for the ceremony.) And
1664,SECTION XIV.,Brāhmanas accomplished in the arts constructed the sacrificial
1665,SECTION XIV.,fire-place with those bricks. And that fire-place of that lion among
1666,SECTION XIV.,"kings, set by skilful Brāhmanas, consisting on three sides of eighteen"
1667,SECTION XIV.,"bricks, looked like the golden-winged Garura. And for the purpose of"
1668,SECTION XIV.,sacrificing them unto the respective deities were collected beasts and
1669,SECTION XIV.,"reptiles, and birds, and horses, and aquatic animals. And the priests"
1670,SECTION XIV.,sacrificed all these in proper form. And to these _Yupas_ were bound
1671,SECTION XIV.,"three hundred beasts, as well as the foremost of the best horses"
1672,SECTION XIV.,"belonging to king Daçarātha. Then Kaucalyā, having performed the"
1673,SECTION XIV.,"preliminary rites, with three strokes slew that horse, experiencing"
1674,SECTION XIV.,"great glee. And with the view of reaping merit Kaucalyā, with an"
1675,SECTION XIV.,undisturbed heart passed one night with that horse furnished with wings.
1676,SECTION XIV.,"And the _Hotâs_ and _Adhwaryus_, and the _Uâgatas_ joined the king’s"
1677,SECTION XIV.,_Vâvâtâ_ along with his _Mahishi_ and _Parivriti_¹⁵ And priests of
1678,SECTION XIV.,"subdued senses, well-up in sacrificial rites, began to offer oblations"

1680,SECTION XIV.,"lord of men, desirous of removing his sins, at the proper time smelt the"
1681,SECTION XIV.,"odour of the smoke arising from the fat, agreeably to the scriptures."
1682,SECTION XIV.,And then sixteen sacrificial priests in the prescribed form offered the
1683,SECTION XIV.,various parts of the horse unto the fire. It is customary in other
1684,SECTION XIV.,sacrifices to offer the oblations by means of a _Plaksha_ bough; but in
1685,SECTION XIV.,"the horse-sacrifice a cane is used instead. The horse-sacrifice,"
1686,SECTION XIV.,"according to the Kalpa Sutras and the Brāhmanas, extend over three days."
1687,SECTION XIV.,"There after, on the first day was the _Chatushtoma_ celebrated; and on"
1688,SECTION XIV.,"the second the _Uktha_,— and on the third the _Atiratra_. And then the"
1689,SECTION XIV.,"_Jyotishtoma_, and then _Ayushtoma_, and the _Atiratra_ and the"
1690,SECTION XIV.,"_Abhijit_, and the _Viswajit_, and the _Aptoryama_—all these various"
1691,SECTION XIV.,great sacrifices were celebrated with due rites. And in this mighty
1692,SECTION XIV.,"horse-sacrifice founded of yore by Sayambhu, that perpetuator of his"
1693,SECTION XIV.,"line, the king, bestowed the Eastern quarter on his chief sacrificial"
1694,SECTION XIV.,"priest, the Western on his _Adhwaryu_, the Southern on Brahmā, and the"
1695,SECTION XIV.,"Northern on the _Udgath_, as _Dakshinas_. And having completed that"
1696,SECTION XIV.,"sacrifice, that perpetuator of his race, and foremost of men, the king,"
1697,SECTION XIV.,"conferred on the priests the earth; and having conferred it, that"
1698,SECTION XIV.,auspicious descendant of Iskhāku experienced high delight. And then the
1699,SECTION XIV.,"priests spoke unto that monarch, who had all his sins purged off,"
1700,SECTION XIV.,"saying,—""Thou alone art worthy to protect the entire world. We do not"
1701,SECTION XIV.,"want the earth; nor can we rule it, being, O lord of Earth, constantly"
1702,SECTION XIV.,"engaged in Vaidika studies. Do thou, therefore, confer upon us something"
1703,SECTION XIV.,"instead, as the price thereof. Do thou confer upon us gems, or gold, or"
1704,SECTION XIV.,"kine, or anything else, for, O foremost of monarchs, we do not want"
1705,SECTION XIV.,"Earth."" Thus addressed by the Brāhmanas versed in the Veda, that best of"
1706,SECTION XIV.,"kings bestowed upon them ten lacs of kine, and ten _Kotis_ of gold, and"
1707,SECTION XIV.,"forty of silver. Then those priests in a body, accepting the wealth,"
1708,SECTION XIV.,brought it unto the ascetic Rhishyasringa and the intelligent Vasishtha.
1709,SECTION XIV.,"Then having receieived each his share, those foremost of regenerate ones"
1710,SECTION XIV.,"were exceedingly pleased, and said,—""We have been highly gratified."""
1711,SECTION XIV.,"Then unto those Brāhmanas that had come there, the king with due regard"
1712,SECTION XIV.,gave _Kotis_ of gold. And unto a certain poor twice-born one that asked
1713,SECTION XIV.,"for gifts, the descendant of Raghu gave an excellent ornament from his"
1714,SECTION XIV.,"own arm. And, when the regenerate ones were thus properly gratified,"
1715,SECTION XIV.,"that one cherishing the Brāhmanas, with senses intoxicated by excess of"
1716,SECTION XIV.,"joy, reverentially bowed unto them. And thereupon the Brāhmanas uttered"
1717,SECTION XIV.,"various blessings upon that generous king, bending low to the earth."
1718,SECTION XIV.,"Then having celebrated that excellent and sin-destroying sacrifice,"
1719,SECTION XIV.,"bringing heaven, and incapable of being celebrated by foremost monarchs,"
1720,SECTION XIV.,"king Daçarātha, well pleased, spoke unto Rhisyasinga, saying,—""0 thou of"

1722,SECTION XIV.,"increase."" Thereupon the best of Brāhmanas said,—""Be it so! Unto thee, O"

1724,SECTION XIV.,"sweet words of his, that foremost of monarchs bended low unto him with"

1743,SECTION XV.,that effulgent one set about the son-conferring ceremony; and in

1746,SECTION XV.,"the _Siddhas_, and the principal saints, assembled there duly, with the"
1747,SECTION XV.,object of each obtaining his share of the offerings. And having duly
1748,SECTION XV.,"assembled there, the deities addressed these words unto Brahmā, the lord"
1749,SECTION XV.,"of creatures,—""O thou possessed of the six attributes, through thy"
1750,SECTION XV.,"grace, a Rākshasa named Rāvana oppresses us all by his prowess,—nor can"

1760,SECTION XV.,"that Rākshasa of dreadful appearance. And O lord, it behoves thee to"
1761,SECTION XV.,"devise some means for destroying him."" Thus addressed by the deities in"
1762,SECTION XV.,"a body, he said,—""Alas! I have, however, decided on the means of"

1853,SECTION XVI.,"red face, uttering the blares of a trumpet, and having a body covered"

1855,SECTION XVI.,"furnished with auspicious marks, and adorned with celestial ornaments,"
1856,SECTION XVI.,"and resembling a mountain-peak, and bearing the prowess of a flaming"
1857,SECTION XVI.,"tiger, and like unto the Sun or tongues of flaming fire. And with his"
1858,SECTION XVI.,"eyes fixed upon Daçarātha, he addressed the king, saying,—""O monarch,"
1859,SECTION XVI.,"take thou me as a person commisioned by _Prajāpati_."" Hearing him speak"
1860,SECTION XVI.,"thus, Daçarātha, with joined hands, said,—’Lord, art thou welcome? What"
1861,SECTION XVI.,"can I do for thee?"" Thereupon, that person despatched by _Prajāpati_"
1862,SECTION XVI.,"again spake thus,—""O king, having adored the deities, thou hast to-day"
1863,SECTION XVI.,"obtained this. Do thou foremost of kings, accept this excellent and"
1864,SECTION XVI.,"divinly-prepared Pāyasa, conferring sons, health, and affluence,—which"
1865,SECTION XVI.,"thou art to give unto thy worthy consorts, saying,—_Partake it_. Through"
1866,SECTION XVI.,"them thou wilt, O monarch, obtain sons,—for obtaining whom thou hast"
1867,SECTION XVI.,"performed this sacrifice."" Thereupon, saying,—""So be it,"" the lord of"
1868,SECTION XVI.,men delightedly placed that divinely-bestowed golden vessel filled with
1869,SECTION XVI.,the celestial _Pāyasa_ upon his head. And having saluted that wonderful
1870,SECTION XVI.,"being of gracious presence, he in excess of joy began to go round him"
1871,SECTION XVI.,"again and again. Then Daçarātha, having received that divinely-prepared"
1872,SECTION XVI.,"_Pāyasa_, waxed exceeding glad; like unto a pauper attaining plenty."
1873,SECTION XVI.,"Then that highly effulgent being of a wonderful form, having performed"
1874,SECTION XVI.,"that mission of his, vanished even there. And Daçarātha’s inner"
1875,SECTION XVI.,"apartment, being graced with the rays of joy, looked like unto the"
1876,SECTION XVI.,welkin flooded with the lovely beams of the autumnal moon. Then entering
1877,SECTION XVI.,"the inner apaitment, he spake unto Kausalya, saying,—""Take thou this"
1878,SECTION XVI.,"_Pāyasa_; for this will make thee bear a son."" Having said this,the king"
1879,SECTION XVI.,offered unto her a portion of this _Pāyasa_. Then he conferred upon
1880,SECTION XVI.,"Sumitrā a fourth of it. Then in order that she might have a son, king"
1881,SECTION XVI.,Daçarātha made over unto Kaikeyi an equal portion of what remained. And
1882,SECTION XVI.,"then having reflected, the mighty-minded one gave unto Sumitrā the"
1883,SECTION XVI.,remaining portion of the _Pāyasa_ resembling ambrosia. Thus the king
1884,SECTION XVI.,dispensed the _Pāyasa_ unto each and all of his wives. And those
1885,SECTION XVI.,"foremost wives of the king, having received that _Pāyasa_, became"
1886,SECTION XVI.,"exceedingly delighted, and considered themselves as highly honored. Then"
1887,SECTION XVI.,"those excellent consorts of the lord of earth, having separately"
1888,SECTION XVI.,"partaken of that choice _Pāyasa_, shortly bore offspring, resmbling fire"

1890,SECTION XVI.,obtained his desire and became delighted; even as that foremost of the

2030,SECTION XVIII.,"And thus were separately born four high-souled sons unto the king,"

2033,SECTION XVIII.,"sweetly, and the _Apsarās_ to dance. And the celestial kettledrums"
2034,SECTION XVIII.,sounded; and there showered down blossoms from the sky. And high
2035,SECTION XVIII.,festivities were commenced by the multitude in Ayodhyā. And the spacious
2036,SECTION XVIII.,"highways became filled with players and dancers, glittering with all"
2037,SECTION XVIII.,"kinds of gems, and resounding with the music of singers and performers"
2038,SECTION XVIII.,on instruments. And the king bestowed gifts upon bards and genealogists
2039,SECTION XVIII.,"and penegyrists, and he also gave kine by thousands to Brāhmanas."
2040,SECTION XVIII.,
2041,SECTION XVIII.,"And when the eleventh day had gone by, the king performed the Naming"
2042,SECTION XVIII.,"ceremony of his sons. And experiencing great delight, Vasishtha"
2043,SECTION XVIII.,conferred the names. And the high- souled eldest one was called Rāma;
2044,SECTION XVIII.,and Kaikeyi’s son was called Bharata; and Sumitrā’s son was called
2045,SECTION XVIII.,"Lakshmana,— and the last was named Satrughna. And the king fed the"
2046,SECTION XVIII.,Brāhmanas as well as the inhabitants rural and urban; and he bestowed
2047,SECTION XVIII.,heaps of jewels upon Brāhmanas. Thus did he celebrate the natal rites of

2052,SECTION XVIII.,And all were accomplished in knowledge; and endowed with virtues. And
2053,SECTION XVIII.,"among them all, the exceedingly puissant Rāma, having truth for prowess,"

2055,SECTION XVIII.,"He could ride on elephants and horses, and was an adept in managing"

2059,SECTION XVIII.,"Rāma, that delight of all. And like unto another life of Rāma, Lakshmana"
2060,SECTION XVIII.,furnished with auspiciousness was in everything attentive to Rāma’s
2061,SECTION XVIII.,"wishes, even at the neglect of his own person. And that foremost of"

2063,SECTION XVIII.,"partake any sweetmeat that was offered, unless Rāma partook it with him."
2064,SECTION XVIII.,"And when mounted on horse-back, Rāghava went a-hunting, Lakshmana went"
2065,SECTION XVIII.,"at his back bow in hand, protecting him. And that younger brother of"
2066,SECTION XVIII.,"Lakshmana, Satrughna, likewise became ever dearer unto Bharata than life"
2067,SECTION XVIII.,itself.
2068,SECTION XVIII.,
2069,SECTION XVIII.,"And on account of those exalted and well-beloved sons of his, Daçarātha"
2070,SECTION XVIII.,"experienced the excess of joy, like unto the Grand-sire on account of"

2073,SECTION XVIII.,"attain wisdom in everything, and to be far-sighted,Daçarātha, the father"
2074,SECTION XVIII.,"of such powerful and flamingly effulgent sens, became delighted even"
2075,SECTION XVIII.,"like that lord of worlds—Brahmā. And those best of men, ever engaged in"
2076,SECTION XVIII.,"the study of the Vedas, were accomplished in the art of archery—and"
2077,SECTION XVIII.,always intent upon ministering unto their father.

2079,SECTION XVIII.,"And once upon a time, when the virtuous king Daçarātha, surrounded by"

2084,SECTION XVIII.,"Gadhi’s son, sprung in the Kuçika line, have come!"" Hearing those words"
2085,SECTION XVIII.,"of his, they urged on by them, all hurriedly began to run towards the"
2086,SECTION XVIII.,"royal chambers. And coming to the royal apartments, they communicated to"
2087,SECTION XVIII.,Ikshwāku’s descendant the arrival of the ascetic Viswāmitra. Hearing
2088,SECTION XVIII.,"those words of theirs, Daçarātha surrounded by his priests, went out"
2089,SECTION XVIII.,"delightedly to meet him, like Vāsava going out to meet Vrihashpati.²⁹"
2090,SECTION XVIII.,"And having come unto that ascetic observing vows and of flaming energy,"
2091,SECTION XVIII.,the monarch with a cheerful countenance offered him the _Arghya_. And
2092,SECTION XVIII.,"there- upon, having accepted the king’s _Arghya_ in accordance with the"
2093,SECTION XVIII.,"ordinance, he enquired of the lord of men as to his continued prosperity"
2094,SECTION XVIII.,and peace. And the exceedingly virtuous descendant of Kuçika asked the
2095,SECTION XVIII.,"king concerning the welfare of the exchequer, and the provinces; and the"
2096,SECTION XVIII.,"peace of his friends and acquaintances. ""And are thy captains"
2097,SECTION XVIII.,submissive: and hast thou vanquished thy foes? And hast thou performed
2098,SECTION XVIII.,"well the human and the divine rites?"" And approaching Vasishtha and the"
2099,SECTION XVIII.,"other anchorites, that foremost of ascetics of exalted piety duly asked"
2100,SECTION XVIII.,them touching their welfare. And having been properly received by the
2101,SECTION XVIII.,"monarch, they with glad hearts entered the royal residence, and sat them"
2102,SECTION XVIII.,down according to precedence. Then gladly worshipping the mighty
2103,SECTION XVIII.,"ascetic, Viswāmitra, the exceedingly generous king, well-pleased,"
2104,SECTION XVIII.,"addressed him, saying,—""Like unto the obtaining of ambrosia, like unto a"

2165,SECTION XIX.,"being protected by me, is capable of even destroying those Rākshasas"
2166,SECTION XIX.,"disturbing the ceremony. And I will, without doubt,confer upon him"
2167,SECTION XIX.,"manifold blessings,—by means of which he will secure the golden opinions"
2168,SECTION XIX.,"of the three worlds. And encountering Rāma,they will by no means be able"
2169,SECTION XIX.,"to stand him, nor is there any other who dares to slay them. And puffed"
2170,SECTION XIX.,"up with energy, they have become ensnared at the hands of Kāla,³⁰ —and,"
2171,SECTION XIX.,"O best of monarchs, they are no match for Rāma. Nor, king, ought thou to"
2172,SECTION XIX.,indulge in paternal affection. For ten nights only Rāma is to remain
2173,SECTION XIX.,"there, with the object of slaying those foes to my sacrifice, those"
2174,SECTION XIX.,"Rākshasas disturbing the rites. I tell thee, do thou consider the"
2175,SECTION XIX.,Rākshasas as already slain. I know full well Rāma of sterling
2176,SECTION XIX.,"prowess,—as also the highly-energetic Vasishtha and the other ascetics"
2177,SECTION XIX.,"present here. And if thou, O king, set thy heart upon acquiring"
2178,SECTION XIX.,"religious merit and high fame on earth, do thou then grant me Rāma! And,"
2179,SECTION XIX.,"O Kākutstha,³¹ if thy counsellors together with the Brāhmanas having"
2180,SECTION XIX.,"Vasishtha at their head, consent, do thou then dismiss Rāma! Even this"
2181,SECTION XIX.,"is my wish,—and he also hath come of age. Do thou, therefore, part with"
2182,SECTION XIX.,"thy son, the lotus-eyed Rāma, for the ten days of the sacrifice! Do thou"
2183,SECTION XIX.,"act so, O descendant of Raghu, that the time appointed for the ceremony"
2184,SECTION XIX.,may not be overpassed. Good betide thee! Let not thy mind indulge in
2185,SECTION XIX.,"grief!"""

2187,SECTION XIX.,"Having said these words consistent with virtue and interest, the"

2209,SECTION XX.,fitness to cope with Rākshasas in battle. I am the lord of this
2210,SECTION XX.,"_Akshaukini_³² of forces. Marching with this, will I engage with the"

2227,SECTION XX.,"the four sons of mine, I find my highest delight in Rāma, my first-born,"
2228,SECTION XX.,"and the most virtuous of them all,—therefore, it behoveth thee not to"
2229,SECTION XX.,take Rāma. What is the prowess of the Rākshasas? And whose sons are
2230,SECTION XX.,"they? And who, pray, are they? And what are the proportions of their"
2231,SECTION XX.,"bodies? And who protecteth them, O foremost of ascetics? And by what"

2240,SECTION XX.,that lord of the Rākshasas is the very brother of Vacravana and the son
2241,SECTION XX.,of the ascetic Vicravan. And when that one possessed of mighty strength
2242,SECTION XX.,"does not stoop to disturb the sacrifice himself, those powerful"
2243,SECTION XX.,"Rākshasas, Mārich and Suvāhu, being incited by him, disturb the rites."""
2244,SECTION XX.,"The ascetic having spoken thus, the king then answered him,—""I am"

2255,SECTION XX.,not part with my son. The sons of Sunda and Upasunda resemble Kāla
2256,SECTION XX.,"himself in battle,—and it is they who are disturbing thy sacrifice."
2257,SECTION XX.,Therefore I will not part with my son. And Māricha and Suvāhu are
2258,SECTION XX.,"possessed of prowess, and accomplished in weapons. But with my friends I"
2259,SECTION XX.,"will repair to encounter one of them. If thou do not consent to this, I"
2260,SECTION XX.,"beseech thee with my friends, (do thou desist!)"" Hearing these words of"
2261,SECTION XX.,"the lord of men, a mighty ire took possession of that foremost of"
2262,SECTION XX.,"regenerate ones, Kuçika’s son; and the fire of the Maharshi’s wrath"

2281,SECTION XXI.,"come. O Kākuthstha’s descendant false in promise, do thou attain"
2282,SECTION XXI.,"happiness, being surrounded by thy friends."" And when the intelligent"
2283,SECTION XXI.,"Viçwāmitra was exercised with wrath, the entire earth began to tremble,"
2284,SECTION XXI.,and the gods even were inspired with awe. And knowing that the entire
2285,SECTION XXI.,"universe was in trepidation, that mighty saint, the sedate Vasishtha of"
2286,SECTION XXI.,"excellent vows, said these words unto the king,—""Born in the line of"
2287,SECTION XXI.,"Ikshwāku, thou art the very second self of virtue. And endowed with"
2288,SECTION XXI.,"patience, and auspicious, and observing excellent vows, thou ought not"
2289,SECTION XXI.,to renounce virtue. The descendant of Raghu is famed over the three
2290,SECTION XXI.,worlds as righteous-souled. Do thou maintain thy habit of adhering to
2291,SECTION XXI.,promise; for it doth not behove thee to act unrighteously. If having
2292,SECTION XXI.,"promised,—’I will do so,’ thou dost not act up to thy word, the merit"
2293,SECTION XXI.,thou hast achieved by digging tanks and by performing sacrifices shall
2294,SECTION XXI.,"come to naught,—therefore do thou renounce Rāma! Accomplished or not"
2295,SECTION XXI.,"accomplished in weapons, the Rākshasas cannot bear him protected by"
2296,SECTION XXI.,"Kuçika’s son, like ambrosia, by flaming fire. This one is Virtue"
2297,SECTION XXI.,incarnate: this one is the foremost of those possessing prowess. This
2298,SECTION XXI.,"one surpasseth all others in learning, and is the refuge of asceticism."
2299,SECTION XXI.,This one is cognizant of all the weapons that exist in the three worlds
2300,SECTION XXI.,furnished with mobile and imobile things; but others do not know
2301,SECTION XXI.,"him,—nor yet shall know him hereafter. And neither the gods, nor the"
2302,SECTION XXI.,"saints, nor the immortals, nor the Rākshasas, nor the foremost of"
2303,SECTION XXI.,"Gandharbas and Yakshas, nor the Kinnaras, nor the mighty Serpents can"

2305,SECTION XXI.,"kingdom, Sivā conferred upon him the highly famous sons of Kricācwa in"
2306,SECTION XXI.,the shape of all weapons. And those sons of Kricācwa were the offspring
2307,SECTION XXI.,"of Prajāpati’s daughters. They were endowed with various forms, and were"
2308,SECTION XXI.,"effulgent and dreadful. And Daksha’s daughters of elegant waists, Jayā"
2309,SECTION XXI.,"and Suprabhā, brought forth an hundred exceedingly effulgent weapons."
2310,SECTION XXI.,"And by virtue of her boon, Jayā obtained fifty sons of immeasurable"
2311,SECTION XXI.,strength and endued with the power of becoming invisible for the purpose
2312,SECTION XXI.,of slaughtering the hosts of the Asuras. And Suprabhā also brought forth
2313,SECTION XXI.,"fifty sons named _Sanhāras_, incapable of being borne, and infallible,"
2314,SECTION XXI.,and powerful. Kuçika’s son is adequately conversant with all those
2315,SECTION XXI.,weapons. And that one knowing duty is also capable of creating wonderful
2316,SECTION XXI.,"weapons. And, O descendant of Raghu, there is nothing present, past, or"
2317,SECTION XXI.,"future which is not known by that foremost of ascetics of high soul, and"
2318,SECTION XXI.,cognizant of morality. Such is the prowess of that highly famous
2319,SECTION XXI.,"Viçwāmitra possessed of mighty energy. Therefore, O king, it behoveth"
2320,SECTION XXI.,thee not to hesitate in the matter of Rāma’s going. The descendant of
2321,SECTION XXI.,Kuçika is himself capable of repressing the Rākshasas; and it is in
2322,SECTION XXI.,"order to thy son’s welfare that coming unto thee, he asketh for him of"

2337,SECTION XXII.,"Daçarātha, smelling his son’s crown, with a glad heart, made him over"

2339,SECTION XXII.,"and of delicious feel, on witnessing the lotus-eyed Rāma at the hands of"
2340,SECTION XXII.,"Viçwāmitra. And as the high-souled one was about to set out, blossoms"

2348,SECTION XXII.,"faultless limbs went in the wake of the ascetic, illumining him with"

2350,SECTION XXII.,"following the incomprehensible deity, Sthānu, those youthful brothers of"

2353,SECTION XXII.,"with scimitars, with their fingers encased in _Guana_ skin, flamingly"
2354,SECTION XXII.,"followed Kuçika’s son, beautifying him with their splendour. And having"
2355,SECTION XXII.,"proceeded over half a _Yojana_, and arriving at the right bank of the"
2356,SECTION XXII.,"Sarayu, Viçwāmitra addressed these sweet words unto Rāma,—""O Rāma! do"
2357,SECTION XXII.,"thou, O child, take of this water: let no delay occur. Do thou receive"
2358,SECTION XXII.,"the _mantras_ Valā and Ativalā,—and thou wilt not feel fatigue or fever"
2359,SECTION XXII.,"or undergo any change of look, and whether asleep or heedless, the"
2360,SECTION XXII.,"Rākshasas will not be able to surprise thee. And, O Rāma, the might of"
2361,SECTION XXII.,"thy arms will be unequalled in this world,—nay, in all the three worlds."
2362,SECTION XXII.,"There shall be none—thy equal. Do thou, O Rāghava, recite Valā and"
2363,SECTION XXII.,"Ativalā, O child! And, O sinless one, when thou hast secured these two"

2365,SECTION XXII.,"or in talent, or in philosophic wisdom or in subtle apprehension, or in"
2366,SECTION XXII.,the capacity of answering a controversialist; for Valā and Ativalā are
2367,SECTION XXII.,"the nurses of all knowledge. And, O Rāma, O foremost of men, if thou"
2368,SECTION XXII.,recitest Valā and Ativalā on the way. neither hunger nor thirst will
2369,SECTION XXII.,"exercise thee, O descendant of Raghu! And if thou recitest these, thou"
2370,SECTION XXII.,wilt attain fame on earth. Those sciences fraught with energy are the
2371,SECTION XXII.,"daughters of the Grandsire. I intend to confer them upon thee, O"
2372,SECTION XXII.,"Kākutstha; and, O lord of earth, they are worthy to be conferred upon"
2373,SECTION XXII.,thee as thou art possessed of various virtues. Thou need not entertain
2374,SECTION XXII.,any doubt about it. And if thou learn them like unto the exercise of
2375,SECTION XXII.,"asceticism they will prove of manifold good unto thee."" Thereat Rāma"
2376,SECTION XXII.,"with a cheerful countenance sipping water, with a purified body received"
2377,SECTION XXII.,those sciences from the _Maharshi_ of subdued soul. And furnished with
2378,SECTION XXII.,"the sciences, Rāma of dreadful prowess appeared resplendent, even like"
2379,SECTION XXII.,the adorable autumnal Sun invested with a thousand rays. Then Rāma
2380,SECTION XXII.,having rendered unto Kuçika’s son all the duties appertaining to a

2401,SECTION XXIII.,"proceeding, at the shining confluence of the Sarayu and the Gangā they"

2403,SECTION XXIII.,"hermitage, belonging to ascetics of subdued souls, where they had been"

2408,SECTION XXIII.,"desirous of hearing this. Surely, great is our curiosity."" At those"
2409,SECTION XXIII.,"words of theirs, that foremost of ascetics, smiling, said,—""Hear, O"
2410,SECTION XXIII.,"Rāma, as to whom the asylum belonged in time past. Kandarpa, called Kāma"
2411,SECTION XXIII.,"by the wise, was once incarnate (on earth.) And it came to pass that as"
2412,SECTION XXIII.,"that lord of the deities, Sthānu, having performed here his austerities"
2413,SECTION XXIII.,"in accordance with the prescribed restrictions, was wending his way in"
2414,SECTION XXIII.,"company with the Maruts, that fool-hardy wight dared disturb the"
2415,SECTION XXIII.,"equanimity of his mind. Thereupon, descendant of Raghu, uttering a roar,"
2416,SECTION XXIII.,the high-souled Rudra eyed him steadfastly. And thereat all the limbs of
2417,SECTION XXIII.,that perverse-hearted one became blasted. On his body being consumed by
2418,SECTION XXIII.,"that high- souled one, Kāma was deprived of his person in consequence of"
2419,SECTION XXIII.,"the ire of that foremost among the deities; and, O Rāghava, from that"
2420,SECTION XXIII.,"time forth, he hath become known as Ananga.³⁶  And the place where he"
2421,SECTION XXIII.,was deprived of his body is the lovely land of Anga. This sacred
2422,SECTION XXIII.,"hermitage belongs to Sivā; and these ascetics engaged in pious acts, O"
2423,SECTION XXIII.,"hero, have been from father to son his disciples. And no sin toucheth"
2424,SECTION XXIII.,"them. Here, O Rāma, in the midst of the sacred streams, will we spend"

2475,SECTION XXIV.,Sarayu issues from that pool of Brahmā. And as the Sarayu meets the
2476,SECTION XXIV.,"Jāhnavi, this tremendous uproar is heard, being produced by the clashing"
2477,SECTION XXIV.,"of the waters. Do thou, O Rāma, bow down to them with a concentrated"
2478,SECTION XXIV.,"mind."" Thereupon, both of these exceedingly righteous ones, bowed down"
2479,SECTION XXIV.,"unto those streams; and betaking themselves to the right bank, began to"
2480,SECTION XXIV.,"proceed with fleet vigour. And beholding a dreadful trackless forest,"
2481,SECTION XXIV.,"that son of the foremost of men, Ikshhwaku’s descendant, asked that best"
2482,SECTION XXIV.,"of ascetics, saying,— ""Ah! deep is this forest abounding in crickets;"
2483,SECTION XXIV.,"and filled with terrible ferocious beasts,and various birds possessed of"
2484,SECTION XXIV.,"shocking voices and screaming frightfully; and graced by lions, and"
2485,SECTION XXIV.,"tigers, and boars, and elephants; and crowded with _Dhavas_⁴⁰ and"
2486,SECTION XXIV.,_Acwas_ and _Karnas_⁴¹ and _Kukubhas_ and _Vilmas_⁴² and _Tindukas_⁴³
2487,SECTION XXIV.,"and _Patalas_⁴⁴ and _Badaris_.⁴⁵ Whence is this dreadful forest?"" Him"
2488,SECTION XXIV.,"answered thus the mighty asetic Viçwāmitra endowed with high energy,—""Do"
2489,SECTION XXIV.,"thou listen, O Kākutshtha, as to whom belongeth this dreadful forest!"
2490,SECTION XXIV.,"Here were formerly, O foremost of men, two flourishing provinces, named"
2491,SECTION XXIV.,"Malada, and Karusha, built by celestial architects. In days of yore, O"
2492,SECTION XXIV.,"Rāma, on the occasion of the destruction of Vritra, the thousand-eyed"
2493,SECTION XXIV.,"one came to have hunger, to be besmeared with excreta, and to slay a"
2494,SECTION XXIV.,"Brāhmana. And when Indra had been thus besmeared, the deities, and the"
2495,SECTION XXIV.,"saints having asceticism for wealth, washed him here, and cleansed his"
2496,SECTION XXIV.,"person from the dirt. And the deities, having renounced here the filth"
2497,SECTION XXIV.,"that had clung unto the person of the mighty Indra, as well as his"
2498,SECTION XXIV.,"hunger, attained exceeding delight. And thereat Indra becoming purified,"
2499,SECTION XXIV.,"attained his former brightness, and became devoid of hunger. And"
2500,SECTION XXIV.,"mightily pleased with this region, he conferred on it an excellent boon,"
2501,SECTION XXIV.,"saying,—""Since these two places have held excreta from my body, they"
2502,SECTION XXIV.,"going by the names of Malada and Karusha, shall attain exceeding"
2503,SECTION XXIV.,"prosperity and fame among men."" And beholding the land thus honored by"
2504,SECTION XXIV.,"the intelligent Sacra, the deities said unto the subduer of"
2505,SECTION XXIV.,"Pāka,—’Well!"" ""Well!"" And, O repressor of foes, these two places, Malada"
2506,SECTION XXIV.,"and Karusha, enjoyed prosperity for a long lime and were blessed with"
2507,SECTION XXIV.,"corn and wealth. Then after a space of time, was born a Yakshini capable"
2508,SECTION XXIV.,"of assuming forms at will, and endowed with the strength of a thousand"
2509,SECTION XXIV.,"elephants. Her name, good betide thee! was Tārakā, and she was the"
2510,SECTION XXIV.,"spouse of the intelligent Sunda—she whose son is the Rākshasa, Māricha"
2511,SECTION XXIV.,"possessed of the prowess of Sacra; having round arms, with a huge head,"
2512,SECTION XXIV.,a capacious mouth and a cyclopean body. And that Rakshasa of dreadful
2513,SECTION XXIV.,"form daily frightens people. And, O descendant of Raghu, Tārakā of"
2514,SECTION XXIV.,"wicked deeds, daily commits havoc upon these countries, Malada and"
2515,SECTION XXIV.,"Karusha . And now at the distance of over half a Yojana, she stayeth,"
2516,SECTION XXIV.,"obstructing the way. And since this forest belongeth unto Tārakā, thou"
2517,SECTION XXIV.,"shouldst repair thither and, resorting to the might of thy own arms,"
2518,SECTION XXIV.,"slay this one of wicked deeds. And by my direction, do thou again rid"
2519,SECTION XXIV.,"this region of its thorn; for no one dareth to approach such a place,"
2520,SECTION XXIV.,"infested, O Rāma, by the dreadful and unbearable Yakshini. And now I"
2521,SECTION XXIV.,have related unto thee all about this fearful forest. And to this day

2549,SECTION XXV.,"Hearing this excellent speech of that ascetic of immeasurable energy,"
2550,SECTION XXV.,"that foremost of men answered him in these happy words,—""O best of"
2551,SECTION XXV.,"ascetics, I have heard that the Yaksha race is endowed with but small"
2552,SECTION XXV.,prowess. How can then that one of the weaker sex possess the strength of
2553,SECTION XXV.,"a thousand elephants?"" Hearing this speech that was uttered by Rāghava"
2554,SECTION XXV.,"of immeasurable energy, Viçwāmitra, delighting with his amiable words"
2555,SECTION XXV.,"that subduer of foes, Rāma, and Lakshmana, said,—""Do thou listen as to"
2556,SECTION XXV.,"the means whereby attaining terrible strength, that one belonging to the"
2557,SECTION XXV.,weaker sex hath come to possess strength and prowess by virtue of a
2558,SECTION XXV.,boon. In former times there was a mighty and exceedingly powerful
2559,SECTION XXV.,"Yaksha, named Suketu. And he had no issue. And he was of pure practices,"
2560,SECTION XXV.,"and used to perform rigid austerities. And, O Rāma, the Grand-sire, well"
2561,SECTION XXV.,"pleased with that lord of Yakshas, conferred upon him a gem of a"
2562,SECTION XXV.,"daughter, by name Tārakā. And the Grand-sire endowed her with the"
2563,SECTION XXV.,strength of a thousand elephants; yet that illustrious one did not
2564,SECTION XXV.,"bestow a son on that Yaksha. And when she had grown, and attained youth"
2565,SECTION XXV.,"and beauty, he gave that famous damsel unto Jambha’s son, Sunda, for"
2566,SECTION XXV.,"wife. And after a length of time, that Yakshi gave birth to a son, named"
2567,SECTION XXV.,"Māricha, possessed of irrepressible energy—him who became a Rākshasa in"
2568,SECTION XXV.,"consequence of a curse. And, O Rāma, when Sunda had been destroyed,"
2569,SECTION XXV.,"Tārakā along with her son, set her heart upon afflicting that excellent"
2570,SECTION XXV.,"saint Agastya. And enraged with Agastya, she rushed at him with a roar,"
2571,SECTION XXV.,"intending to devour him. And on seeing her thus rushing, that worshipful"
2572,SECTION XXV.,"saint, Agastya, said unto Māricha, ""Do thou become a Rākshasa!"", and, in"
2573,SECTION XXV.,"exceeding wrath, he also cursed Tārakā. ""And, O mighty Yakshi, ince in"
2574,SECTION XXV.,frightful guise with a frightful face thou hast desired to eat up a
2575,SECTION XXV.,"human being, do thou immediately leave this (thy original) shape, and"
2576,SECTION XXV.,"become of a terrible form!"" Thus cursed by Agastya, Tārakā, overwhelmed"
2577,SECTION XXV.,"with rage, lays waste this fair region, where Agastya carrieth on his"
2578,SECTION XXV.,"austerities. Do thou, O descendant of Raghu, for the welfare of"
2579,SECTION XXV.,"Brāhmanas and kine, slay this exceedingly terrible Yakshi of wicked ways"
2580,SECTION XXV.,"and vile prowess! Nor, O son of Raghu, doth any one in the three worlds,"
2581,SECTION XXV.,"save, thee, dare to slay this Yakshi joined with a curse. Nor shouldst"
2582,SECTION XXV.,"thou, best of men, shrink from slaying a woman; for even this should be"
2583,SECTION XXV.,accomplished by a prince in the interests of the four orders. And
2584,SECTION XXV.,"whether an act be cruel or otherwise, slightly or highly sinful, it"
2585,SECTION XXV.,"should for protecting the subjects, be performed by a ruler. Of those"
2586,SECTION XXV.,"engaged in the onerous task of government, even this is the eternal rule"
2587,SECTION XXV.,"of conduct. Do thou, O Kukutstha, slay this impious one; for she knoweth"
2588,SECTION XXV.,"no righteousness! We hear, O king, that in days of yore, Sakra slew"
2589,SECTION XXV.,"Virochana’s daughter, Mantharā, who had intented to distroy the earth."
2590,SECTION XXV.,"And formerly, O Rāma, Vishnu destroyed Kāvya’s mother, the devoted wife"
2591,SECTION XXV.,"of Bhrigu, who had set her heart upon making the world, devoid of Indra."
2592,SECTION XXV.,By these as well as innumerable princes—foremost of men—have wicked
2593,SECTION XXV.,"women been slain. Therefore, O king, renouncing antipathy, do thou, by"
2594,SECTION XXV.,"my command, slay this one!"""

2604,SECTION XXVI.,ought fearlessly to do even as Kuçika’s son sayeth. And havingbeen
2605,SECTION XXVI.,"desired to that end while at Ayodhyā by that high-souled one, my father"
2606,SECTION XXVI.,"Daçarātha, in the midst of the spiritual guides, I ought not to pass by"
2607,SECTION XXVI.,"thy words. Therefore, commanded by that upholder of the Veda, I,"
2608,SECTION XXVI.,"agreeably to my father’s mandate, will, without doubt, bring about that"
2609,SECTION XXVI.,"welcome event—the death of Tārakā. And in the interests of Brāhmanas,"
2610,SECTION XXVI.,"kine, and celestials, I am ready to act as desired by thee of"
2611,SECTION XXVI.,"immeasurable energy."" Having said this, that repressor of foes, with"
2612,SECTION XXVI.,"clenched fist, twanged his bow-string, filling the ten cardinal points"
2613,SECTION XXVI.,"with the sounds. And at those sounds, the dwellers in Tārakā’s forest"
2614,SECTION XXVI.,"were filled with perturbation,—and Tārakā also amazed at those sounds,"
2615,SECTION XXVI.,"became exceedingly wroth. And, rendered almost insensible by anger, that"
2616,SECTION XXVI.,Rākshasi furiously rushed in amain towards the spot whence had come the
2617,SECTION XXVI.,report. And beholding that frightful one of hideous visage and colossal
2618,SECTION XXVI.,"proportions, transported with rage, Raghu’s descendant spake unto"
2619,SECTION XXVI.,"Lakshmana,—""Behold, O Lakshmana, the terrible and hideous body of yonder"
2620,SECTION XXVI.,Yakshini! The sight of her striketh terror into the hearts of even the
2621,SECTION XXVI.,"brave. Mark! - This irrepressible one, possessing all the resources of"
2622,SECTION XXVI.,"illusion, will I oppose, and deprive her of ears and nose. But I dare"
2623,SECTION XXVI.,"not slay her, she being protected by virtue of her fcminineness. I"
2624,SECTION XXVI.,"intend only to oppose her course, and de- prive her of her prowess."" As"
2625,SECTION XXVI.,"Rāma was speaking thus, Tārakā, deprived of sense through ire, uttering"
2626,SECTION XXVI.,"roars, with uplifted arms rushed against him. And thereat the"
2627,SECTION XXVI.,"Brahmārshi, Viçwāmitra, uttering a roar, upbraided her, and said,—"
2628,SECTION XXVI.,"""_Swasti!_""⁴⁶ May victory attend the descendants of Raghu!"" And raising"
2629,SECTION XXVI.,"thick clouds of dust, Tārakā instantly bewildered both the descendants"
2630,SECTION XXVI.,"of Raghu. And then by help of illusion, she began to pour upon them a"
2631,SECTION XXVI.,mighty shower of crags. And thereat Raghu’s descendant was wroth. And
2632,SECTION XXVI.,"resisting that mighty shower of crags by vollies of shafts, Rāghava with"
2633,SECTION XXVI.,arrows cut off her hands. And with the fore-parts of her arms lopped
2634,SECTION XXVI.,"off, as she was roaring before them, Sumitrā’s son waxing worth deprived"
2635,SECTION XXVI.,her of her ears and nose. Therupon that one capable of assuming forms at
2636,SECTION XXVI.,"will, began to assume various shapes; and to vanish from sight,"
2637,SECTION XXVI.,bewildering her antagonists with her illusory displays. And terribly
2638,SECTION XXVI.,"ranging the field, the Yakshi showered crags upon her antagonists. And"
2639,SECTION XXVI.,"beholding them enveloped on all sides by that craggy down-pour, the"
2640,SECTION XXVI.,"auspicious son of Gadhi spake these words,—""O Rāma, renounce thy"
2641,SECTION XXVI.,antipathy. This one of wicked ways is exceedingly impious. And this
2642,SECTION XXVI.,"sacrifice-disturbing Yakshi will, by virtue of her power of illusion,"
2643,SECTION XXVI.,"come to increase more and more in energy. Do thou, therefore, against"
2644,SECTION XXVI.,"the arrival of dusk, slay her! The Rākshasas are incapable of being"
2645,SECTION XXVI.,"controlled when evening sets in."" Thus addressed, Rāma, displaying his"
2646,SECTION XXVI.,"skill in aiming by sounds, enveloped with arrows that Yakshi showering"
2647,SECTION XXVI.,"crags. Being thus hemmed in with a network cf shafts, she possessed of"
2648,SECTION XXVI.,"the powers of illusion, rushed against Kākutstha and Lakshmana, uttering"
2649,SECTION XXVI.,"terrible roars. And as that Yakshi, in prowess like unto a thunder-bolt,"
2650,SECTION XXVI.,"was rushing on, Rāma pierced her chest with arrows,—and thereat she"
2651,SECTION XXVI.,"dropped down and died. And upon seeing that grim-visaged one slain, the"
2652,SECTION XXVI.,lord of the celestials together with the celestials themselves honoring
2653,SECTION XXVI.,"Kākutstha, exclaimed ""Well!"", ""Well!"" And exceedingly pleased, the"
2654,SECTION XXVI.,"thousand -eyed Purandara, together with the delighted deities,said unto"
2655,SECTION XXVI.,"Viçwāmitra,—""O ascetic, O Kuçika’s son, good betide thee! all the Maruts"

2657,SECTION XXVI.,"Do thou therefore show affection unto Rāghava! Do thou, O Brāhmana,"

2660,SECTION XXVI.,"Brāhmana, is fit to receive them of thee. And this son of the king is to"
2661,SECTION XXVI.,"accomplish a mighty task in the interest of the celestials."" Saying"
2662,SECTION XXVI.,"this, the deities, having paid homage unto Viçwāmitra, joyfully entered"

2664,SECTION XXVI.,
2665,SECTION XXVI.,"And now came evening on, when that best of ascetics, gratified at the"

2777,SECTION XXVIII.,"like clouds? Great is my curiosity. It is pleasing unto the sight, and"
2778,SECTION XXVIII.,"abounds in beasts, and is exceedingly romantic, and is adorned with"
2779,SECTION XXVIII.,"various birds singing sweetly. Now, O foremost of ascetics, we have come"
2780,SECTION XXVIII.,out of a wilderness capable of making one’s hair stand on end. And from
2781,SECTION XXVIII.,"the pleasantness attaching to this place, I have come to a conclusion."
2782,SECTION XXVIII.,"Tell me, O reverend sir, whose hermitage is this? where, O eminent"
2783,SECTION XXVIII.,"ascetic, is that hermitage where dwell those wicked-minded wretches of"
2784,SECTION XXVIII.,"impious deeds, given to slaughtering Brāhmanas, who disturb thy"
2785,SECTION XXVIII.,"sacrifice? Where, O adorable one, is that spot, repairing unto which, O"
2786,SECTION XXVIII.,"Brāhmana, I am to protect thy sacrificial rites, and to slay the"
2787,SECTION XXVIII.,"Rākshasas? All this, O foremost of ascetics, I desire to hear, O lord."""

2793,SECTION XXIX.,
2794,SECTION XXIX.,"Hearing those words of Rāma of measureless prowess, vho had asked the"
2795,SECTION XXIX.,"question, the highly energetic Viçwāmitra answered, saying,—""Here, O"
2796,SECTION XXIX.,"mighty-armed Rāma, Vishnu of mighty asceticism worshipped of all the"
2797,SECTION XXIX.,"deities, for years upon years, and hundreds of _Yugas_, dwelt for"
2798,SECTION XXIX.,"carrying on his austerities and _Yoga_. This, O Rāma, was formerly the"
2799,SECTION XXIX.,"hermitage of the high-souled Vāmana. And this is famed as Siddhāçrama,"
2800,SECTION XXIX.,in consequence of that one of potent asceticism having attained fruition
2801,SECTION XXIX.,"there. And it came to pass that at this time Virochana’s son, king Vāli,"
2802,SECTION XXIX.,"having vanquished the celestials with Indra and the Maruts, established"
2803,SECTION XXIX.,"that dominion of his, famous in the three worlds. And that mighty chief"
2804,SECTION XXIX.,of the Asuras celebrated a sacrifice. And as Vāli was performing that
2805,SECTION XXIX.,"sacrifice, the deities with Agni at their head, coming unto Vishnu"
2806,SECTION XXIX.,"himself at this asylum, addressed him, saying.—""Virochana’s son, Vāli, O"
2807,SECTION XXIX.,"Vishnu, is celebrating a sacrifice. Do thou, before the ceremoney is"
2808,SECTION XXIX.,"finished, accomplish thy own end. He duly conferreth upon such as repair"
2809,SECTION XXIX.,unto him from various quarters all those things that they ask for. And
2810,SECTION XXIX.,"do thou thyself, O Vishuu, aided by thy power of illusion, assuming a"
2811,SECTION XXIX.,"Dwarf-form, accomplish the welfare (of the celestials.)"" In the"
2812,SECTION XXIX.,"meantime, O Rāma, the wonderful Kasyapa resembling fire in splendour,"
2813,SECTION XXIX.,"and flaming in energy, having in company with, and with the assistance"
2814,SECTION XXIX.,"of, the divine Aditi, O Rāma, accomplished his vow, lasting for hundred"
2815,SECTION XXIX.,"years, began to hymn the destroyer of Madhu ready to confer boons. ""By"
2816,SECTION XXIX.,"means of warm austerities, do I behold thee composed of penances, a mass"
2817,SECTION XXIX.,"of mortifications, and endowed with a form and a soul of austerities."
2818,SECTION XXIX.,"And in thy person, O lord, do I behold this entire universe. And in Thee"
2819,SECTION XXIX.,"without beginning, and incapable of being pointed out, do I take"
2820,SECTION XXIX.,"refuge!"" Thereupon exceedingly pleased, Hari spake unto Kaçyapa, with"
2821,SECTION XXIX.,"his sins purged off saying,—""Do thou mention the boon! Good betide thee."
2822,SECTION XXIX.,"Methinks thou deservest a boon."" Hearing these words of his, Marichi’s"
2823,SECTION XXIX.,"son, Kaçyapa, said,—""Aditi, the gods and I myself, crave of thee"
2824,SECTION XXIX.,"this,—and, O bestower of boons, it behoveth thee well pleased to confer"
2825,SECTION XXIX.,"on us this boon, O thou of excellent vows! Do thou, O sinless one,"
2826,SECTION XXIX.,"become born as my son in Aditi, O adorable deity! Do thou become the"
2827,SECTION XXIX.,"younger brother of Sakra, O destroyer of Asuras. It behoveth thee to"
2828,SECTION XXIX.,help the celestials afflicted with grief. And this place through thy
2829,SECTION XXIX.,"grace will attain the name of Siddhāçrama. The work, O lord of the"
2830,SECTION XXIX.,"celestials, hath been accomplished. Do thou now, O thou of the six"
2831,SECTION XXIX.,"attributes, ascend from hence!"" And accordingly Vishnu of mighty energy"
2832,SECTION XXIX.,"took his birth in Aditi. And assuming the form of a dwarf, he presented"
2833,SECTION XXIX.,himself before Virochana’s son. And then asking for as much earth as
2834,SECTION XXIX.,"could be covered by three footsteps, that one ever engaged in the"
2835,SECTION XXIX.,"welfare of all creatures, with the object of compassing the good of all,"
2836,SECTION XXIX.,"stood occupying the worlds. And having by his power restrained Vāli,"
2837,SECTION XXIX.,"that one of exceeding energy, again conferred the three worlds upon the"
2838,SECTION XXIX.,"mighty Indra,—and made them subject to his control. Formerly he used to"
2839,SECTION XXIX.,dwell in this asylum capable of removing fatigue. And through reverence
2840,SECTION XXIX.,"for the Dwarf, I reside here. And this hermitage is infested by"
2841,SECTION XXIX.,"Rākshasas disturbing rites. And, O most puissant of men, here thou"
2842,SECTION XXIX.,"shouldst slay those ones of wicked ways. To-day, O Rāma, will I repair"
2843,SECTION XXIX.,"unto this supremely excellent Siddhāçrama. And this asylum, child, is as"
2844,SECTION XXIX.,"much thine as mine."" Saying this, taking Rāma and Lakshmana, the mighty"
2845,SECTION XXIX.,"ascetic, experiencing exceeding delight, entered that asylum, and"
2846,SECTION XXIX.,"appeared graceful, like the Moon emerged from mist in conjunction with"
2847,SECTION XXIX.,"the Punarvasu stars. And beholding Viçwāmitra, the ascetics inhabiting"
2848,SECTION XXIX.,"Siddhāçrama, suddenly rising in joy, worshipped that intelligent"
2849,SECTION XXIX.,"one,—and extended unto the princes the rites of hospitality. And then"
2850,SECTION XXIX.,"having reposed for while, those unreproved princes, the descendants of"
2851,SECTION XXIX.,"Raghu, with clasped hands, addressed that foremost of ascetics,—""Be thou"
2852,SECTION XXIX.,"even to-day initiated unto the ceremony. Good betide thee, O best of"
2853,SECTION XXIX.,"ascetics! Let this Siddhāçrama verily attain fruition,—and let thy words"
2854,SECTION XXIX.,"be verified!"" Thus addressed, that mighty saint of exceeding energy,"
2855,SECTION XXIX.,"with his mind subdued, and senses under restraint, caused himself to be"
2856,SECTION XXIX.,"initiated into the ceremony. And like unto the Kumāras,⁴⁹ Rāma and"
2857,SECTION XXIX.,"Lakshamana, having passed the night pleasantly, rose in the morning; and"
2858,SECTION XXIX.,"having finished their morning worship, and with purity and"
2859,SECTION XXIX.,"self-restraint recited the prime _mantras_, paid their obeisance unto"
2860,SECTION XXIX.,"the sacrificial fire and the sacrificer, Viçwāmitra, who was seated."

2869,SECTION XXX.,"Then those princes, repressors of foes, cognizant of place, and time,"
2870,SECTION XXX.,"and words, thus spake unto Kuçika’s son agreeably to time and place,"
2871,SECTION XXX.,"saying,—""O adorable one do thou tell us as to the time when we should"
2872,SECTION XXX.,"oppose those rangers of the night! Let not that hour pass away!"" Upon"
2873,SECTION XXX.,"the two Kākutsthas’ saying this, and finding them prompt for the"
2874,SECTION XXX.,"encounter, those ascetics well-pleased, fell to extolling the sons of"
2875,SECTION XXX.,"the king. ""For six nights from to-day, ye should protect us. This"
2876,SECTION XXX.,"ascetic hath been initiated into the sacrifice, and must therefore,"
2877,SECTION XXX.,"observe taciturnity."" Hearing these words of theirs, those illustrious"
2878,SECTION XXX.,"princes, renouncing sleep, began to guard the hermitage six days and"
2879,SECTION XXX.,nights; and those heroic and mighty archers with their armours on
2880,SECTION XXX.,protected that best of ascetics and subduer of enemies. And when time
2881,SECTION XXX.,"had thus gone by and the sixth day had arrived, Rāma said unto Sumitrā’s"
2882,SECTION XXX.,"son,—""Being well equipped, be thou vigilant!"" When Rāma, manifesting"
2883,SECTION XXX.,"emotion, and being eager for encounter, had said this, the priests and"
2884,SECTION XXX.,spiritual guides lit up the altar. And along with Viçwāmitra and the
2885,SECTION XXX.,"family priests, they lit up the altar furnished with Kuça, and Kāca, and"
2886,SECTION XXX.,"ladles, and faggots, and flowers. And as reciting _mantras_, they were"
2887,SECTION XXX.,"about to duly engage in that sacrifice, there arose a mighty and"
2888,SECTION XXX.,"dreadful uproar in the sky. And as in the rains, masses of clouds appear"
2889,SECTION XXX.,"enveloping the firmament,⁵⁰ the Rākshasas, displaying illusions in that"
2890,SECTION XXX.,"wise, began to rush onward. And Maricha and Suvahu together with their"
2891,SECTION XXX.,"followers coming in dreadful forms, began to shower down blood upon the"
2892,SECTION XXX.,"altar. And on seeing the altar deluged with gore, Rāma suddenly rushed"
2893,SECTION XXX.,"forward, and beheld them in the sky. And suddenly seeing them rushing in"
2894,SECTION XXX.,"amain, the lotus-eyed Rāma fixing his gaze at Lakshmana, said,—""Behold,"
2895,SECTION XXX.,"O Lakshmana, by means of a _Mānava_ weapon, I shall, without doubt,"
2896,SECTION XXX.,"drive away the wicked, flesh-eating Rākshasas, even as the wind driveth"
2897,SECTION XXX.,away clouds before it. Surely I cannot bring myself to slay such as
2898,SECTION XXX.,"these."" Saying this, that descendant of Raghu, Rāma, in vehemence fixing"
2899,SECTION XXX.,"on his bow an exceedingly mighty and gloriously-dazzling Mānava weapon,"
2900,SECTION XXX.,discharged it in great wrath at Māricha’s chest. And wounded by that
2901,SECTION XXX.,"foremost of Mānava weapons, Māricha carried off a sheer hundred Yojanas,"
2902,SECTION XXX.,"dropped in the midst of the ocean. And finding Māricha senseless, and"
2903,SECTION XXX.,"whirling, and afflicted by the might of the weapon, and overcome, Rāma"
2904,SECTION XXX.,"addressed Lakshmana, saying,—""Behold, O Lakshmana, this Mānava weapon"
2905,SECTION XXX.,"first used by Manu, depriving him of his senses, hath carried him"
2906,SECTION XXX.,"off,—and yet hath not taken his life! But these shameless, wicked, and"
2907,SECTION XXX.,"blood-drinking Rākshasas, addicted to wrong-doing, these disturbers of"
2908,SECTION XXX.,"sacrifices, will I slaughter."" Having said this, anon showing unto"
2909,SECTION XXX.,"Lakshmana his lightness of hand, Raghu’s descendant took out a mighty"
2910,SECTION XXX.,"Agneya weapon, and discharged it at the breast of Suvāhu. Thereat being"
2911,SECTION XXX.,"pierced with that shaft, he fell down upon the ground. Then taking a"
2912,SECTION XXX.,"Vāyavaya weapon, the illustrious and exceedingly generous Rāghava,"
2913,SECTION XXX.,"bringing delight unto those ascetics, slew the rest. And having"
2914,SECTION XXX.,"destroyed all those Rākshasas disturbing sacrifices, Raghu’s descendant"
2915,SECTION XXX.,"was honored by the saints, even as Indra in days of yore, after having"
2916,SECTION XXX.,"vanquished the Asuras. And when the sacrifice had been completed, the"
2917,SECTION XXX.,"mighty ascetic Viçwāmitra, beholding all sides cleared of Rākshasas,"
2918,SECTION XXX.,"spake unto Kākutstha, saying,—""O mighty-armed one, I have obtained my"
2919,SECTION XXX.,"desire; and thou hast executed thy preceptor’s mandate. And, O"
2920,SECTION XXX.,"illustrious hero, thou hast truly made this a Siddhacrama."" Having thus"
2921,SECTION XXX.,"extolled Rāma, he took Rāma and Lakshmana, to perform his evening"
2922,SECTION XXX.,devotions.

2936,SECTION XXXI.,and the rest. And having saluted that foremost of ascetics resembling
2937,SECTION XXXI.,"flaming fire, they of honied speech spake unto him words exceedingly"
2938,SECTION XXXI.,"lofty.—""These servants of thine, O best of ascetics, have come before"
2939,SECTION XXXI.,"thee. Do thou command, O chief of anchorets, what command of thine are"
2940,SECTION XXXI.,"we to execute?"" Thus addressed by them, the Maharshis with Viçwāmitra at"
2941,SECTION XXXI.,"their head spake unto Rāma, saying,—""A highly meritorious sacrifice, O"
2942,SECTION XXXI.,"foremost of men, is to be celebrated by Mithila’s lord, Janaka. Thither"
2943,SECTION XXXI.,"shall we repair. And thou, O great among men, must accompany us, and"
2944,SECTION XXXI.,there behold a wonderful jewel of a bow. And formerly this bow of
2945,SECTION XXXI.,"immeasurable energy, and dreadful, and exceedingly effulgent at the"
2946,SECTION XXXI.,"sacrifice, had been conferred in court by the celestials (on king"
2947,SECTION XXXI.,"Devarāta). And neither gods nor Gandharbas, neither Asuras nor Rākshasas"
2948,SECTION XXXI.,"nor men, can fix the string upon it. And desirous of being acquainted"
2949,SECTION XXXI.,"with the prowess of this bow, many kings and princes came; but they in"
2950,SECTION XXXI.,"spite of their mighty strength, failed in stringing it. There,"
2951,SECTION XXXI.,"Kākutstha, thou wilt behold that bow belonging to the high-souled king"
2952,SECTION XXXI.,"of Mithilā,—as well as his exceedingly wonderful sacrifice. That rare"
2953,SECTION XXXI.,"bow, O foremost of men, furnished with an excellent device for griping"
2954,SECTION XXXI.,"it, had been solicited by Mithilā’s lord as the fruit of his sacrifice;"
2955,SECTION XXXI.,"and the celestials conferred it upon him. And now, O descendant of"
2956,SECTION XXXI.,"Raghu, in the residence of king, the bow is worshipped like a deity with"
2957,SECTION XXXI.,"_aguru_, _dhupa_, and various other incenses."" This having been said,"
2958,SECTION XXXI.,"that foremost of ascetics, in company with Kākutstha and the saints,"
2959,SECTION XXXI.,"departed. And on the eve of setting out, he addressed the sylvan"
2960,SECTION XXXI.,"deities, saying,—""Luck! I will, with my desire obtained, go from forth"
2961,SECTION XXXI.,"this Siddhāçrama unto the Himavat mountain on the north of the Jāhnavi."""
2962,SECTION XXXI.,"Having said this, that tiger-like ascetic, Kuçika’s son, along with"
2963,SECTION XXXI.,"other anchorets having asceticism for their wealth, set out in a"
2964,SECTION XXXI.,"northerly direction. And as that best of ascetics proceeded, he was"
2965,SECTION XXXI.,"followed by Brāhmanas upholding the Veda, carrying the sacrificial"
2966,SECTION XXXI.,necessaries on an hundred cars. And birds and beasts dwelling in
2967,SECTION XXXI.,Siddhāçrama followed the high-souled Viçwāmitra having asceticism for
2968,SECTION XXXI.,wealth. And then followed by the body of devotees he dismissed the
2969,SECTION XXXI.,"birds. And having proceded a longway, when the sun was sloping down, the"
2970,SECTION XXXI.,ascetics rested on the banks of the Sona. And when the maker of day had
2971,SECTION XXXI.,"set, having bathed and offered oblations unto the fire, those ascetics"
2972,SECTION XXXI.,"of immeasurable energy, placing Viçwāmitra in their front, sat them"
2973,SECTION XXXI.,"down. And Rāma also together with Sumitrā’s son, having paid homage unto"
2974,SECTION XXXI.,"those ascetics, sat him down before the intelligent Viçwāmitra. Then"
2975,SECTION XXXI.,"Rāma of exceeding energy, influenced by curiosity, asked that foremost"

3053,SECTION XXXIII.,"Hearing those words of theirs, the highly pious and puissant king"

3075,SECTION XXXIII.,"concluding that the ascetic was gratified, the Gandharbi, cognizant of"

3082,SECTION XXXIII.,"pleased with her, the Brahmārshi Chulina conferred upon her an excellent"
3083,SECTION XXXIII.,"Brāhmya mind-begotten son, named Brahmādatta. And that king,"
3084,SECTION XXXIII.,"Brahmādatta, founded the flourishing city of Kampilyā,even as the"
3085,SECTION XXXIII.,"sovereign of the celestials founded the celestial regions. And, O"
3086,SECTION XXXIII.,"Kākutstha, the righteous king Kuçanābha finally decided on conferring"
3087,SECTION XXXIII.,his hundred daughters upon Brahmādatta. And inviting Brahmādatta that
3088,SECTION XXXIII.,"highly energetic lord of earth, with a glad heart conferred his hundred"
3089,SECTION XXXIII.,"daughters upon him. And, O descendant of Raghu, king Brahmādatta"
3090,SECTION XXXIII.,"resembling the lord himself of the celestials, by turns received their"
3091,SECTION XXXIII.,"hands in marriage. And as soon as he touched them, the hundred daughters"
3092,SECTION XXXIII.,"were cured of their crookedness, and became free from anguish, and were"
3093,SECTION XXXIII.,"endowed with pre-eminent beauty, And upon beholding them delivered from"

3120,SECTION XXXIV.,"following her lord, she ascended heaven in her own proper person. And my"

3132,SECTION XXXIV.,"also of this place, O mighty-armed one,—which thou hadst asked me to"
3133,SECTION XXXIV.,"relate. But, O Kākutstha, while I was speaking, half the night hath been"
3134,SECTION XXXIV.,"spent. Do thou now sleep, good betide thee,—so that thou mayst not feel"

3169,SECTION XXXV.,"when the day had been half spent they beheld that foremost of streams,"

3171,SECTION XXXV.,"furnished with sacred waters, and frequented by swans and cranes, the"
3172,SECTION XXXV.,ascetics who accompanied Rāghava were exceedingly delighted. And they
3173,SECTION XXXV.,took up their quarters on the banks of the river. And then having bathed

3184,SECTION XXXV.,"and progress, O Rāma, that great mine of ore, Himavat is the foremost of"
3185,SECTION XXXV.,"mountains. Unto him were born two daughters, unparalleled on earth in"
3186,SECTION XXXV.,"loveliness. And, O Rāma, their mother of dainty waist, the amiable"
3187,SECTION XXXV.,"daughter of Meru, named Menā, was the beloved wife of Himavat—she of"
3188,SECTION XXXV.,"whom was born Gangā the elder daughter of Himavat; and, O Rāghava, a"
3189,SECTION XXXV.,"second daughter was also born unto him, named Uma. And it came to pass"
3190,SECTION XXXV.,"that once upon a time, the deities, with the view of accomplishing some"
3191,SECTION XXXV.,"work appertaining to them as divine beings, in a body besought that"
3192,SECTION XXXV.,"foremost of mountains for that river flowing in three directions, Gangā."
3193,SECTION XXXV.,"Thereupon, desirous of the welfare of the three worlds, Himavat in"

3225,SECTION XXXVI.,relate unto Kākutstha that history in detail in the midst of the
3226,SECTION XXXVI.,"ascetics. ""In days of yore, O Rāma, the blue-throated one of mighty"
3227,SECTION XXXVI.,"asceticism, having entered into matrimony, commenced upon knowing the"
3228,SECTION XXXVI.,"goddess. And as that intelligent blue-throated god, Mahādeva, was thus"
3229,SECTION XXXVI.,"engaged in sport, a devine hundred years passed away; and yet, O Rāma,"
3230,SECTION XXXVI.,"chastiser of foes, no son was born of her. Thereat all the gods with the"
3231,SECTION XXXVI.,"Grand sire at their head became exceedingly anxious. ""Who will be able"
3232,SECTION XXXVI.,"to bear the offspring of this union?"" And thereupon the celestials"
3233,SECTION XXXVI.,"repairing unto Mahādeva, thus addressed him, saluting low,—’O god of"
3234,SECTION XXXVI.,"gods, O mighty deity, ever engaged in the welfare of all, it behoveth"
3235,SECTION XXXVI.,thee to be propitious at the humble salutations of the celestials. The
3236,SECTION XXXVI.,"worlds, O foremost of celestials, are incapable of bearing thy energy."
3237,SECTION XXXVI.,"Therefore, for the welfare of the three worlds, do thou, being furnished"
3238,SECTION XXXVI.,"with Brahmā asceticism, in company with the goddess practise"
3239,SECTION XXXVI.,"austerities, and rein in thy energy by thy native indomitableness. Do"
3240,SECTION XXXVI.,thou preserve these worlds; for it becometh thee not to destroy all.’
3241,SECTION XXXVI.,"Hearing the words of the deities, the great god of the worlds said unto"
3242,SECTION XXXVI.,"them,—’So be it!’ And addressing them again he said,—’Ye gods, by my own"
3243,SECTION XXXVI.,"energy I will assisted by Umā bear my virile vigour,—therefore let the"
3244,SECTION XXXVI.,"creation find rest! But tell me, ye foremost of celestials, who will"
3245,SECTION XXXVI.,sustain my potent virility rushing out from its receptacle?’ Being thus
3246,SECTION XXXVI.,"addressed, the gods answered him having the bull for his mark,—’The"
3247,SECTION XXXVI.,"earth will to-day bear thy vital flow.’ Thus assured, the mighty lord of"
3248,SECTION XXXVI.,the celestials let go his vital fluid; and thereat the earth containing
3249,SECTION XXXVI.,mountains and forests was overspread with the energy. Then the gods
3250,SECTION XXXVI.,"spake unto the Fire, saying,—’Do thou in company with the Wind enter"
3251,SECTION XXXVI.,into this fierce and mighty energy!’ And when the Wind had entered into
3252,SECTION XXXVI.,"it, it was developed into a white hill, and a forest of glossy reeds,"
3253,SECTION XXXVI.,resembling fire or the Sun. And here sprang from Fire Kārtikeya of
3254,SECTION XXXVI.,"mighty energy. And there- upon the celestials and the saints, with"
3255,SECTION XXXVI.,"gratified hearts, began to pay enthusiastic adorations unto Umā aud"
3256,SECTION XXXVI.,"Sivā. Then the Mountain’s daughter, O Rāma, addressed the celestials,"
3257,SECTION XXXVI.,"cursing them with eyes reddened in wrath,—’While in association with"
3258,SECTION XXXVI.,"Mahādeva for obtaining sons, I was broken in upon by ye,—for this, ye"
3259,SECTION XXXVI.,shall not be able yourselves to beget offspring on your wives. And from
3260,SECTION XXXVI.,"this day forth, your wives shall remain without issue.’ Having thus"

3263,SECTION XXXVI.,"stained because of my ire, shalt thou experience the pleasure that is"
3264,SECTION XXXVI.,"felt on obtaining a son, O thou of wicked understanding, O thou that"

3285,SECTION XXXVII.,"Agni at their head, bowing unto him, addressed that possessor of the six"
3286,SECTION XXXVII.,"attributes, the Grand-sire, saying,—’0 God, that adorable one who had"
3287,SECTION XXXVII.,"formerly consigned unto us the generalissimo, resorting to high"
3288,SECTION XXXVII.,"asceticism, is practising austerities with Umā. Do thou now, O thou"
3289,SECTION XXXVII.,"conversant with resources, so order as is advisable in the interests of"

3291,SECTION XXXVII.,"deities, the Grandsire of all creatures, consoling them with soft words,"
3292,SECTION XXXVII.,"spoke unto them, saying,—’Even as the Mountain’s daughter hath said,"
3293,SECTION XXXVII.,sons will not be born unto ye of your own wives. Her word is infallible
3294,SECTION XXXVII.,of a certainty: there is no doubt about it. This is the celestial
3295,SECTION XXXVII.,Gangā—she on whom Hutāsana⁵⁴ will beget a son—the foe-subduing
3296,SECTION XXXVII.,generalissimo of the celestials. And the elder daughter of the Mountain
3297,SECTION XXXVII.,"will consider that son as brought forth by Umā; and Umā also will,"
3298,SECTION XXXVII.,"without doubt, look upon him with regard.’ Hearing these words of his, O"
3299,SECTION XXXVII.,"descendant of Raghu, the gods bowing unto the Grand-sire, paid him"
3300,SECTION XXXVII.,"homage. Then, O Rāma, repairing unto the Kailāça mountain teeming with"
3301,SECTION XXXVII.,"metals, the deities commissioned Agni with the view of having a son"
3302,SECTION XXXVII.,"(born unto him.) ’Do thou, O god, accomplish this work of the deities! O"
3303,SECTION XXXVII.,"thou of mighty energy, do thou discharge thy energy into that daughter"
3304,SECTION XXXVII.,"of the mountain, Gangā.’ Thereupon giving his promise unto the gods,"
3305,SECTION XXXVII.,"Pavaka⁵⁵ approached Gangā, saying,— ’Do thou, O Goddess, bear an embryo;"
3306,SECTION XXXVII.,"for even this is the desire of the deities.’ Hearing this speech, she"
3307,SECTION XXXVII.,"assumed a divine appearance. And beholding her mightiness, Agni was"
3308,SECTION XXXVII.,shrunk up on all sides. And then Pavaka from all sides discharged his
3309,SECTION XXXVII.,"energy into her,—and thereat all her streams became surcharged with it,"
3310,SECTION XXXVII.,O descendant of Raghu. And unto him staying at the head of all the
3311,SECTION XXXVII.,"deities, Gangā spoke, saying,—’O god, I am incapable of sustaining this"
3312,SECTION XXXVII.,"new- sprung energy of thine: I am burning with that fire, and my"
3313,SECTION XXXVII.,consciousness fails me.’ Thereupon that partaker of the oblations
3314,SECTION XXXVII.,"offered unto the gods, said unto Gangā,—’Do thou bring forth thy embryo"
3315,SECTION XXXVII.,"on the side of this Himavat!’ Hearing Agni’s words, Gangā of mighty"
3316,SECTION XXXVII.,"energy cast her exceedingly effulgent embryo on her streams, O sinless"
3317,SECTION XXXVII.,"one. And as it came out of her, it wore the splendour of molten gold;"
3318,SECTION XXXVII.,"and in consequence of its fiery virtue, objects near and objects far"
3319,SECTION XXXVII.,"were converted into gold and silver of unsurpassed sheen,—while those"
3320,SECTION XXXVII.,that were more distant were turned into copper and iron. And her excreta
3321,SECTION XXXVII.,"were turned into lead. In this wise, various metals began to increase on"
3322,SECTION XXXVII.,"earth. And as soon as the embryo was brought forth, the woods adjoining"
3323,SECTION XXXVII.,"the mountain, being overspread with that energy, were turned into gold."
3324,SECTION XXXVII.,"And from that day, O descendant of Raghu, gold of effulgence like unto"
3325,SECTION XXXVII.,"that of fire, became known as Jātarupa, O foremost of men! And when the"
3326,SECTION XXXVII.,"son was born, the deities with Indra and the Maruts enjoined ipon the"
3327,SECTION XXXVII.,Kirtikā stars to suckle him. ’Surely he shall be son into us
3328,SECTION XXXVII.,"all’—concluding thus, they as soon as he was born, by turns began to"

3435,SECTION XXXIX.,"Therefore, do thou, O king, act so, that the sacrifice may not be marred"

3438,SECTION XXXIX.,"great sacrifice is, presided over by eminently pious Brāhmanas"
3439,SECTION XXXIX.,"sanctified by mantras, I do not, ye foremost of men, ye sons, see how"

3492,SECTION XL.,"spake unto him, saying —’By us hath the Earth been extensively surveyed,"

3503,SECTION XL.,"And, O son of Raghu, that mighty elephant, Virupāksha, held on his head"

3513,SECTION XL.,And in the Western quarter also those highly powerful ones beheld the
3514,SECTION XL.,"elephant of that quarter named Saumanasa, resembling a mighty mountain."
3515,SECTION XL.,"And having gone round him, and asked him as to his welfare, they delving"

3577,SECTION XLI.,"And thereupon Vinatā’s son possessed of mighty strength spoke unto him,"

3579,SECTION XLI.,for the welfare of all. These highly powerful ones had been consumed by
3580,SECTION XLI.,"the peerless Kapila,—therefore, thou ought not to offer water unto them"
3581,SECTION XLI.,"in consonance with social usuage. Gangā, O foremost of men, is the elder"
3582,SECTION XLI.,daughter of Himavat. In her (streams) do thou perform the watery rites
3583,SECTION XLI.,"of thy uncles, O mighty-armed one: let that purifier of the worlds lave"

3639,SECTION XLII.,"great car-warrior, the highly powerful and mighty-armed Bhagiratha, with"
3640,SECTION XLII.,"clasped hands, said unto the Grand-sire of all creatures,—’If, adorable"

3645,SECTION XLII.,"one, I beseech thee, may our line never languish for want of offspring."
3646,SECTION XLII.,"May, O God, this prime boon light upon Ikshwāku’s race!’ When the king"
3647,SECTION XLII.,"had said this, the Grand-sire addressed him these sweet and auspicious"
3648,SECTION XLII.,"words composed of melting letters,—’O mighty car-warrior Bhagiratha,"
3649,SECTION XLII.,"high is this thy aim. Be it so, good betide thee, thou enhancer of the"
3650,SECTION XLII.,"Ikshwāku line. This Haimavati Gangā, Himavat’s elder daughter, even her"
3651,SECTION XLII.,"to hold, O king, do thou employ Hara; for Gangā’s fall, O king, Earth"
3652,SECTION XLII.,"will not be able to sustain. And to hold her, O king, find I none save"
3653,SECTION XLII.,"the weilder of the Trident."" Having thus addressed the monarch, and"

3656,SECTION XLII.,
3657,SECTION XLII.,"When that god of gods had gone away, Bhagiratha, O Rāma, pressing the"

3660,SECTION XLII.,"unto the king, saying,—’O foremost of men, I am well-pleased with thee:"
3661,SECTION XLII.,I will do what will be for thy welfare. I will hold the Mountain’s

3663,SECTION XLII.,"creatures, the elder daughter of Himavat, assuming an exceedingly mighty"
3664,SECTION XLII.,"shape, with irresistible impetus precipitated herself from the welkin"
3665,SECTION XLII.,"upon Sivā’s gracious head. And that divine one, Gangā, exceedingly"
3666,SECTION XLII.,"difficult to sustain, thought,—’I will enter the nether regions,"
3667,SECTION XLII.,"carrying off Sankara by my streams.’ Knowing her proud intention, the"
3668,SECTION XLII.,adorable Hara waxed wroth; and the three-eyed deity set his heart upon
3669,SECTION XLII.,"enveloping her. And, O Rāma, as that sacred one plunged upon Rudra’s"

3676,SECTION XLII.,"she was let off, seven streams branched out from her. And the three"
3677,SECTION XLII.,streams of the excellent Gangā of auspicious waters went in an easterly
3678,SECTION XLII.,"direction; while the Suchakshu, the Sitā, and that mighty river the"
3679,SECTION XLII.,Sindhu flowed on the auspicious west. And the seventh followed
3680,SECTION XLII.,"Bhagiratha’s car. And that royal saint, the exceedingly puissant"
3681,SECTION XLII.,"Bhagiratha, mounted on a superb car, went before; and Gangā followed"
3682,SECTION XLII.,"him. And she descended from the welkin upon Sankara’s head, thence"
3683,SECTION XLII.,alighting upon the earth; and there her waters flowed with thundering
3684,SECTION XLII.,sounds. And earth looked beautiful with swarms of fallen and falling
3685,SECTION XLII.,"fishes, and tortoises, and porpoises. And then celestials and saints and"
3686,SECTION XLII.,"Gandharbas, and Yakshas and Siddhas mounted on excellent elephants and"
3687,SECTION XLII.,"horses and cars resembling cities, looked on Gangā descending upon the"
3688,SECTION XLII.,earth. And the celestials stationed on cars were struck with surprise;
3689,SECTION XLII.,and all creatures marvelled at the excellent descent of Gangā. And eager

3697,SECTION XLII.,"proceeded sometimes rapidly, and sometimes awry, and sometimes in"
3698,SECTION XLII.,"volumes, and sometimes sloping, and sometimes ascending, and sometimes"
3699,SECTION XLII.,languidly; and sometimes water clashed with water; and sometimes

3701,SECTION XLII.,"water first descending upon Sankara’s head, and thence on to the earth,"
3702,SECTION XLII.,"appeared exceedingly beautiful. And there the saints and the Gandharbas,"
3703,SECTION XLII.,"as well as the inhabitants of the earth, touched the sacred water"
3704,SECTION XLII.,flowing from Bhaba’s body. And those that had fallen from the sky unto
3705,SECTION XLII.,"the earth in consequence of some curse or other, having bathed there,"
3706,SECTION XLII.,and thereby having their sins washed and removed by that sanctifying
3707,SECTION XLII.,"water, again ascended the sky and entered their respective regions. And"
3708,SECTION XLII.,"through the agency of that shining water, all beings, feeling delight,"
3709,SECTION XLII.,"rejoiced, and having bathed in Gangā, became cleansed from sin. And"
3710,SECTION XLII.,"stationed on an excellent car that mighty king, the royal saint"
3711,SECTION XLII.,"Bhagiratha, went first, and Gangā went at his back. And the gods, and"
3712,SECTION XLII.,"the saints, and the Daityas, and the Dānavas, and the Rākshasas, and the"
3713,SECTION XLII.,"foremost of Gandharbas and Yakshas, and the Kinnaras, and the mighty"
3714,SECTION XLII.,"Uragas, and the Serpents, and the Apsarās, O Rāma and the acquatic"
3715,SECTION XLII.,"animals in a body following Bhagiratha’s car, with glad hearts went in"
3716,SECTION XLII.,"the wake of Gangā. And withersoever king Bhagiratha went, the famous"
3717,SECTION XLII.,"Gangā, foremost of streams, capable of destroying all sins, went. And"
3718,SECTION XLII.,"Gangā flooded the sacrificial ground of the high-souled Jahnu, of"
3719,SECTION XLII.,"wonderful deeds, as he was performing a sacrifice. Thereat, O Rāghava,"
3720,SECTION XLII.,"reading her insolence, Jahnu, waxing wroth, drank up all her wonderful"
3721,SECTION XLII.,"waters. Thereupon, the deities, and the Gandharbas, and the saints,"
3722,SECTION XLII.,"struck with amazement, fell to worshipping that foremost of men, the"
3723,SECTION XLII.,high-souled Jahnu and brought Gangā into the daughtership of that high
3724,SECTION XLII.,"souled one. And that highly energetic lord, being propitiated, let Gangā"
3725,SECTION XLII.,off through his ears. Therefore it is that Gangā goes by the name of
3726,SECTION XLII.,Jahnu’s daughter Jāhnavi. Then Gangā again began to follow Bhagiratha’s
3727,SECTION XLII.,"car. And having reached the ocean, that foremost of streams, with the"
3728,SECTION XLII.,"object of accomplishing his work, entered into the subterranean regions."
3729,SECTION XLII.,"And having carefully brought Gangā, that royal saint, Bhagiratha, having"
3730,SECTION XLII.,his senses bewildered beheld his grand-fathers reduced to ashes. And the

3745,SECTION XLIV.,"like unto celestials themselves. And, O lord of earth, as long as the"

3749,SECTION XLIV.,after thy name. And Gangā is called both Tripathagā and Bhāgirathi. And
3750,SECTION XLIV.,"she is known as Tripathagā, in consequence of her proceeding in three"
3751,SECTION XLIV.,"directions. Do thou now, O lord of men, here offer oblations of water"
3752,SECTION XLIV.,"unto thy grand sires,—and thereby, O king, make good thy promise. And, O"
3753,SECTION XLIV.,"king, that foremost of righteous ones, thy ancestor of exceeding renown,"
3754,SECTION XLIV.,"had failed to atain his desire. And, O child, Ançumat likewise"
3755,SECTION XLIV.,unparalleled in the worlds in energy had failed in realising his
3756,SECTION XLIV.,cherished promise of bringing down Gangā. And then again that royal
3757,SECTION XLIV.,"saint, crowned with qualities, of austerities like unto mine, ever"
3758,SECTION XLIV.,"abiding by his Kshatriya duties, even Dilipa’s self—thy exceedingly"
3759,SECTION XLIV.,puissant sire—O eminently righteous one—had failed in bringing down
3760,SECTION XLIV.,"Gangā according to his cherished resolve, O sinless one. And now, O"
3761,SECTION XLIV.,"foremost of men, that promise having been fulfilled by thee, thou shalt"
3762,SECTION XLIV.,"attain signal glory in the world by the common consent of all. And, O"
3763,SECTION XLIV.,"vanquisher of thy foes, having brought about Gangā’s descension, thou"
3764,SECTION XLIV.,"shalt from this act of thine also attain the regions of Brahmā. Do thou,"
3765,SECTION XLIV.,"O best of men, lave thyself in these waters incapable of being rendered"
3766,SECTION XLIV.,"worthless. O prime of men,—and thereby become purified, and attain"
3767,SECTION XLIV.,sanctity. And do thou perform the watery rites of thy grand-sires. May

3802,SECTION XLV.,Let us now cross over this sacred stream—foremost of rivers—wending in

3806,SECTION XLV.,Kauçika crossed over the crowds of ascetics; and on reaching the north
3807,SECTION XLV.,"bank, he paid homage unto the saints. And when they had landed on the"
3808,SECTION XLV.,"banks of tlie Gangā, they beheld a city named Viçāla. And thereupon"
3809,SECTION XLV.,"speedily that foremost of ascetics in company with Rāghava, went towards"
3810,SECTION XLV.,"Viçāla,—beautiful and elegant like unto the celestial regions. Then the"
3811,SECTION XLV.,"highly wise Rāma, with folded hands, asked that mighty ascetic"
3812,SECTION XLV.,"Viçwāmitra concerning the excellent city of Viçāla,-""0 mighty ascetic,"
3813,SECTION XLV.,"what royal line resideth in yonder large city? I desire to hear this,"
3814,SECTION XLV.,"good betide thee; and great is my curiosity."" Hearing those words of"
3815,SECTION XLV.,"Rāma, that foremost of ascetics began to relate the history of Viçāla,"
3816,SECTION XLV.,"saying,—""Do thou listen, O Rāma, to what I had heard from Sakra relating"
3817,SECTION XLV.,"this history; and, O descendant of Raghu, do thou listen to all that"
3818,SECTION XLV.,"befell in this city. Formerly in the Krita age, O Rāma, Diti’s highly"
3819,SECTION XLV.,"powerful sons, as well as those of Aditi, possessed of prowess, and"
3820,SECTION XLV.,"virtuous and pious— high-souled ones both—O foremost of men, fell to"
3821,SECTION XLV.,"reflecting,—’How can we become exempt from decrepitude and disease, and"
3822,SECTION XLV.,"immortal.’ And as they reflected, it struck them,—’By churning the ocean"
3823,SECTION XLV.,"of milk, we must obtain ambrosia.’ Then deciding upon churning (the"
3824,SECTION XLV.,"ocean), those ones of immeasurable energy making Vāsuki the cord, and"
3825,SECTION XLV.,"the Mandara (hill), the stick, began to churn the deep. And after a"
3826,SECTION XLV.,"thousand years had gone by, the hoods (of the serpent) serving as the"
3827,SECTION XLV.,"churning cord, began to vomit virulent venom and to bite at the crags,"
3828,SECTION XLV.,with their fangs. And thereat there came out powerful poison like unto
3829,SECTION XLV.,"fire; and in consequence the entire universe with celestials, and"
3830,SECTION XLV.,"Asuras, and men, began to burn. And thereupon, intending to seek refuge,"
3831,SECTION XLV.,"they appeared before that mighty god, Sankara, or Paçupati, or"
3832,SECTION XLV.,"Rudra,—hymning him,—’Save us.’ ’Save us.’ When that master, the lord of"
3833,SECTION XLV.,"the celestials, was being thus addressed by the deities, there appeared"
3834,SECTION XLV.,before them Hari bearing the conch and the discus. And smiling Hari said
3835,SECTION XLV.,"unto the trident-bearing Rudra,—’O chief of the celestials, since thou"
3836,SECTION XLV.,"art the foremost of the gods, this that hath come out of the ocean"
3837,SECTION XLV.,"churned by the celestials, is thine. Remaining here, O lord, do thou"
3838,SECTION XLV.,receive the first offering in the form of this poison.’ Having said
3839,SECTION XLV.,"this, that best of celestials vanished there. Witnessing the dismay of"
3840,SECTION XLV.,"the celestials, and hearing also the words of Sarngin, Sivā took in that"
3841,SECTION XLV.,"dreadful poison as if it were nectar; and then leaving the deities, the"
3842,SECTION XLV.,"worshipful Hara went away. And then, O descendant of Raghu, as the"
3843,SECTION XLV.,"celestials resumed the churning, that foremost of hills serving as the"
3844,SECTION XLV.,"cord, entered the subterranean regions. Thereupon the gods and the"
3845,SECTION XLV.,"Gandharbas fell to extolling the slayer of Madhu, saying,—’Thou art the"
3846,SECTION XLV.,"way of all beings, of the celestials in especial. Do thou, O"
3847,SECTION XLV.,"mighty-armed one, protect us, and recover the mountain.’ Having heard"
3848,SECTION XLV.,"this, Hrishikesa, or Hari, assuming the form of a tortoise, stood in the"
3849,SECTION XLV.,"sea, supporting the hill on his back; and that Soul of all, Keçava best"
3850,SECTION XLV.,"of male beings, taking hold of the top of the hill by his hand, began to"
3851,SECTION XLV.,"churn the deep, stationed in the midst of the celestials. And after a"
3852,SECTION XLV.,"thousand years had rolled on, arose a male being impregnated with the"
3853,SECTION XLV.,"Ayurveda,⁶¹ of exceedingly righteous soul, called Dhanwantari, bearing"
3854,SECTION XLV.,"in his hands a stick, and a Kamandalu. And there arose also, from the"
3855,SECTION XLV.,"cream of the churning waters, those magnificent dames the shining"
3856,SECTION XLV.,"Apsarās. And, O foremost of men, as they had emerged from water, they"
3857,SECTION XLV.,are called _Apsarās_.⁶² And there sprang sixty _Kotis_ of shining
3858,SECTION XLV.,"Apsarās. And, O Kākutstha, the female attendants of those are"
3859,SECTION XLV.,numberless. And neither the deities nor the Dānavas would accept
3860,SECTION XLV.,"them,—and in consequence of this non-acceptance, they are known as women"
3861,SECTION XLV.,"belonging to all. And then, O Raghu’s descendant, arose the eminently"
3862,SECTION XLV.,"pious daughter of Varuna, Vāruni, who fell to looking for acceptance."
3863,SECTION XLV.,"And Diti’s sons, O Rāma, did not accept the daughter of Varuna,—and"
3864,SECTION XLV.,"Aditi’s sons, O hero, accepted that one of blameless limbs. And hence"
3865,SECTION XLV.,Diti’s sons go by the name of Asuras; and Aditi’s by that of Suras. And
3866,SECTION XLV.,"the celestials became exceeding glad, on having accepted Vāruni. And, O"
3867,SECTION XLV.,"foremost of men, next arose Uchhaiçravā—best of horses, and also"
3868,SECTION XLV.,"Kaustubha; and next, the excellent ambrosia. And,0 Rāma, tremendous was"
3869,SECTION XLV.,the carnage for the porsession thereof (ambrosia); and Aditi’s and
3870,SECTION XLV.,Diti’s sons fought together. And the Asuras assembled together with the
3871,SECTION XLV.,"Rākshasas; and, O hero, mighty was the battle that was fought, striking"
3872,SECTION XLV.,"terror into the three worlds. And when a great havoc had been committed,"
3873,SECTION XLV.,"the highly powerful Vishnu, assuming a captivating form speedily stole"
3874,SECTION XLV.,away the ambrosia. And those that came forward before that best of male
3875,SECTION XLV.,"beings, Vishnu, knowing no deterioration, were crushed in conflict by"
3876,SECTION XLV.,Vishnu in a different form. And in that exceedingly dreadful battle
3877,SECTION XLV.,"between the sons of Diti and Aditi, those heroic ones, _viz_., Aditi’s"
3878,SECTION XLV.,heroic sons slaughtered those of Diti. And having slaughtered the sons

3896,SECTION XLVI.,slayer of Sakra it behoves thee to promise me.’ Hearing those words of
3897,SECTION XLVI.,"hers, Maricha’s son, Kaçyapa of exceeding energy answered the deeply"
3898,SECTION XLVI.,"aggrieved Diti, saying,—’Be it so.’ Good betide thee, do thou become"

3903,SECTION XLVI.,"her person with his palm. And having rubbed her, he said,—’Luck!’ and"
3904,SECTION XLVI.,"then went away to carry on austerities. And when he had gone, Diti, O"
3905,SECTION XLVI.,"foremost of men, becoming exceedingly delighted, went unto Kuçaplava⁶³"
3906,SECTION XLVI.,"and began to practise rigid mortifications. And, O foremost of men, as"
3907,SECTION XLVI.,"she was practising austerities, the thousand-eyed deity most dutifully"
3908,SECTION XLVI.,"ministered unto her. And the thousand-eyed one provided for her fire,"
3909,SECTION XLVI.,"and _Kusa_, and faggots, and water, and fruits, and roots, and other"
3910,SECTION XLVI.,"things that she wanted. And at all times, Sakra served Diti by rubbing"
3911,SECTION XLVI.,"her person, and removing her fatigue. And when ten years only were"
3912,SECTION XLVI.,"wanting to complete the thousand years, Diti, O descendant of Raghu,"
3913,SECTION XLVI.,"being exceedingly delighted, thus spoke unto the thousand-eyed one,—’O"
3914,SECTION XLVI.,"best of those endowed with prowess, of me engaged in austerities, ten"
3915,SECTION XLVI.,"years only remain (to complete the period.) And after that time, good"
3916,SECTION XLVI.,"betide thee, thou wilt behold thy brother. I will, O son, bind him unto"

3918,SECTION XLVI.,"destruction,—so that, the fever of thy heart removed, thou wilt with him"
3919,SECTION XLVI.,enjoy the victory of the three worlds. On thy high-souled sire having
3920,SECTION XLVI.,"been besought by me, he, O foremost of celestials, granted me the boon"
3921,SECTION XLVI.,"that after a thousand years, I shall obtain a son.’ And it came to pass"
3922,SECTION XLVI.,"that having said this, the sun being in his meridian, the worshipful"
3923,SECTION XLVI.,Diti with her feet placed at that part of the bed which should contain

4000,SECTION XLVIII.,"Açwinis in grace, endowed with youth, like unto celestials fancy-led,"
4001,SECTION XLVIII.,"descended from etherial regions to the earth beneath, whose sons, O"

4003,SECTION XLVIII.,"also is it that they journey on foot? And adoring all directions, like"

4005,SECTION XLVIII.,"other in personal proportions, and expressions, and gestures, and"
4006,SECTION XLVIII.,"equipped with excellent weapons, and war-like, how have these paragons"
4007,SECTION XLVIII.,cf men come into this impracticable way? I wish to hear all this related
4008,SECTION XLVIII.,"truly."" Having heard his words, Viçwāmitra faithfully related all about"
4009,SECTION XLVIII.,"it. Hearing Viçwāmitra’s words, the king was extremely surprised and"
4010,SECTION XLVIII.,"having those sons of Daçarātha as his all-worthy guests, received with"
4011,SECTION XLVIII.,becoming respect those highly powerful ones deserving of hospitality.
4012,SECTION XLVIII.,"And meeting with such splendid reception from Sumati, those descendants"
4013,SECTION XLVIII.,"of Raghu spent there a night, and the next day set out for Mithila. And"

4016,SECTION XLVIII.,"saw an ancient, lonely, and romantic asylum, and asked that foremost of"
4017,SECTION XLVIII.,"ascetics, saying,—""What is this that looketh like an asylum, though"
4018,SECTION XLVIII.,"without any ascetics? I wish to hear, O worshipful one, to whom this"
4019,SECTION XLVIII.,"asylum belonged in time past."" Hearing this speech addressed by Raghu’s"
4020,SECTION XLVIII.,"descendant, that one versed in speech, the highly energetic and mighty"
4021,SECTION XLVIII.,"saint, Viçwāmitra, answered,—""Ah! Do thou listen. I will tell thee"
4022,SECTION XLVIII.,through the wrath of what high-souled one this hermitage came to be
4023,SECTION XLVIII.,"cursed. O foremost of men, this excellent asylum honored by ths"
4024,SECTION XLVIII.,"celestials themselves, formerly belonged to the high- souled Gautama."
4025,SECTION XLVIII.,"And here, O illustrious prince, in days of yore Gautama in company with"
4026,SECTION XLVIII.,Ahalyā carried on austerities for a long series of years. And perceiving
4027,SECTION XLVIII.,"occasion, Sachi’s lord, the thousand-eyed deity, assuming the form of"
4028,SECTION XLVIII.,"that ascetic thus addressed Ahalyā,—’0 exceedingly beautiful one, those"
4029,SECTION XLVIII.,"bent upon sport, do not stay for the menstrual season. And, O graceful"
4030,SECTION XLVIII.,"one, I desire to enjoy thy company (on the instant). Thereupon, out of"
4031,SECTION XLVIII.,"curiosity, that one of perverse understanding consented to the proposals"
4032,SECTION XLVIII.,"of the chief of the celestials. Then, having attained her object, she"
4033,SECTION XLVIII.,"spoke unto that foremost of the celestials, saying.—’O best of the"
4034,SECTION XLVIII.,"immortals, I have obtained my desire, —do thou speedily go from his"
4035,SECTION XLVIII.,"place, O lord. Do thou, O lord of the celestials, from a sense of"
4036,SECTION XLVIII.,"repectibility preserve thyself and me also.’ Indra too smiling, said"
4037,SECTION XLVIII.,"unto Ahalyā,—’O thou of shapely hips, pleased am I. Now I repair unto my"
4038,SECTION XLVIII.,"own place.’ Having known her thus, Indra, Rāma, exceedingly apprehensive"
4039,SECTION XLVIII.,"of Gautama, then hurriedly sallied out of the thatched cottage. Just at"
4040,SECTION XLVIII.,"this time, Indra saw that mighty ascetic Gautama entering—that foremost"
4041,SECTION XLVIII.,"of anchorets, incapable of being repressed by the deities and the"
4042,SECTION XLVIII.,"Dānavas, and equipped with ascetic energy, having bathed in the waters"
4043,SECTION XLVIII.,"of holy spots, and flaming like fire, carrying faggots and _kusa_ grass."
4044,SECTION XLVIII.,"And seeing him, the countenance of the lord of the celestials turned"
4045,SECTION XLVIII.,pale. And seeing the wicked thousand-eyed deity in the guise of an
4046,SECTION XLVIII.,"ascetic, the well-behaved anchoret fired with rage said,— ’And since, O"
4047,SECTION XLVIII.,"thou of wicked understanding assuming my form, thou hast done this foul"
4048,SECTION XLVIII.,"deed, thou shalt lose thy scrotum.’ And soon as the high-souled Gautama"
4049,SECTION XLVIII.,"had said this in ire, the scrotum of the thousand-eyed one dropped to"
4050,SECTION XLVIII.,"the earth. And having seen Sakra in this plight, he cursed his wife"
4051,SECTION XLVIII.,"also,—’For a thousand years thou shalt live here feeding upon air,"
4052,SECTION XLVIII.,"without food, tormented with repentance and thou shalt remain in this"
4053,SECTION XLVIII.,hermitage unseen of any. And when the irrepressible son of Daçarātha
4054,SECTION XLVIII.,"Rāma, shall come to this deep wood, thou shalt be cleansed of thy sin."
4055,SECTION XLVIII.,"And, O wicked one, ministering unto him the rites of hospitality, with a"
4056,SECTION XLVIII.,"mind free from ignorance and covetousness, thou shalt in thy own form"
4057,SECTION XLVIII.,with joy regain my side.’ Having said this to that wicked woman the
4058,SECTION XLVIII.,"highly energetic Gautama of rigid austerities, forsaking this hermitage,"
4059,SECTION XLVIII.,"began to carry on penances on the romantic summit of the Himavat,"
4060,SECTION XLVIII.,"inhabited by Siddhas and Charanas."""

4069,SECTION XLIX.,"Siddhas and the Gandharbas and the Chāranas, saying,—’I have"
4070,SECTION XLIX.,accomplished the work of the celestials by stirring the ire of the high-

4072,SECTION XLIX.,I have been deprived of my scrotum; and Ahalyā also hath been put down.

4074,SECTION XLIX.,"mighty curse,—and, therefore, ye celestials, and saints, and Chāranas,"
4075,SECTION XLIX.,ye should restore my scrotum unto me who have served the gods.’ Hearing
4076,SECTION XLIX.,"Satakratu’s⁶⁵ words, the deities along with the Maruts led by Agni,"
4077,SECTION XLIX.,presented themselves before the divine Pitris.⁶⁶ And then Agni addressed
4078,SECTION XLIX.,"the latter, saying,—’This ram is possessed of a scrotum; while Sakra"
4079,SECTION XLIX.,hath been deprived of his. Do ye taking the scrotum of the ram furnish
4080,SECTION XLIX.,"Sakra with it. And although deprived of the scrotum, the ram will be"

4082,SECTION XLIX.,"offer such a ram for your entertainment, ye will bestow undying and"
4083,SECTION XLIX.,"profuse merit.’ Hearing Agni’s speech, the assembled Pitris, rooting up"
4084,SECTION XLIX.,"the scrotum of the ram, joined it unto the person of the thousand-eyed"
4085,SECTION XLIX.,"deity. Thence- forth, Kākutstha, the divine Pitris together feast upon"
4086,SECTION XLIX.,"scrotumless rams, for their scrotum had been joined unto the person of"

4089,SECTION XLIX.,"Therefore, O highly powerful one, do thou enter the hermitage of that"

4094,SECTION XLIX.,at too near even by the celestials and the Asuras; as if created by the
4095,SECTION XLIX.,Deity to be the divinely charming Woman; like a flame hid in smoke; or
4096,SECTION XLIX.,the brightness of the full moon clouded and dimmed in mist; or the solar
4097,SECTION XLIX.,splendour incapable of being beheld on account of clouds. And by virtue

4101,SECTION XLIX.,"then took hold of her feet; but remembering Gautama’s words, she on her"
4102,SECTION XLIX.,part took hold of theirs. And with a collected mind she gave them water

4299,SECTION LIII.,Viçwāmitra consisting of cheerful and stout men being superbly
4300,SECTION LIII.,"entertained by Vasishtha, became exceedingly gratified. And the royal"
4301,SECTION LIII.,"saint, Viçwāmitra himself, together with the priests and Brāhmanas and"
4302,SECTION LIII.,"the inmates of the inner apartment, was also heartily filled. And being"
4303,SECTION LIII.,"hospitably entertained with his courtiers and counsellors and retainers,"
4304,SECTION LIII.,"he, exceedingly delighted, spoke unto Vasishtha, saying, —’Received and"

4306,SECTION LIII.,"worthy of being honored. Do thou, O thou conversant with speech, listen"

4308,SECTION LIII.,"hundred thousand kine. O worshipful one, varily this one is a jewel; and"
4309,SECTION LIII.,"as it is the function of kings to acquire jewels, do thou confer on me"
4310,SECTION LIII.,"Savalā; for, O twice-born one, this one by right belongs unto me.’ Thus"
4311,SECTION LIII.,addressed by Viçwāmitra the righteous and adorable Vasishtha—best of
4312,SECTION LIII.,"ascetics—replied unto that lord of earth,—’O king, neither for an"
4313,SECTION LIII.,"hundred thousand nor for an hundred _koti_ of kine, nor yet for heaps of"
4314,SECTION LIII.,"silver, will I part with Savalā. O subduer of enemies, this one deserves"
4315,SECTION LIII.,"not to be separated from my side. Even like unto the fame of the mighty,"
4316,SECTION LIII.,this Savalā is ever joined with me. My oblations to the gods and the

4320,SECTION LIII.,depend upon her. All this is so: there is no doubt about it. Verily she
4321,SECTION LIII.,"is my all; and in her do I find my delight. And many are the reasons, O"
4322,SECTION LIII.,"king, why I cannot give unto thee Savalā.’ Thus addressed by Vasishtha,"
4323,SECTION LIII.,"that one versed in speech, Viçwāmitra, eagerly rejoined,— ’I shall"

4600,SECTION LVIII.,"Ikshwākus, their spiritual guide is their prime way; nor art thou"
4601,SECTION LVIII.,capable of setting at naught the words of that truth- telling one. That
4602,SECTION LVIII.,"worshipful saint said, that he was incapable (of accomplishing"
4603,SECTION LVIII.,"this),—how can we then undertake that sacrifice? Thou art ignorant, O"
4604,SECTION LVIII.,"foremost of men. Do thou speedily retrace thy steps. And, O king, that"
4605,SECTION LVIII.,adorable one is competent to officiate at the sacrifice itself of the
4606,SECTION LVIII.,"three worlds, how can we then contribute to his dishonor?’ Hearing those"
4607,SECTION LVIII.,"words of theirs, that king, with accents tremulous with passion, again"
4608,SECTION LVIII.,"addressed them, saying, —’Disregarded by that worshipful one as well as"
4609,SECTION LVIII.,"by the sons of my spiritual guide, I will go after another way,—so peace"
4610,SECTION LVIII.,"be unto ye, ascetics.’ The saint’s sons, on their part, hearing that"
4611,SECTION LVIII.,"speech couching a fierce intent, cursed him in exceeding wrath,"
4612,SECTION LVIII.,"saying,—Thou shalt come by Chandāla-hood.’ Having said this, those"
4613,SECTION LVIII.,high-souled ones entered each into his dwelling. And when the night had
4614,SECTION LVIII.,"gone by, the king came by Chandālahood. And clad in a blue garb, blue"
4615,SECTION LVIII.,"and rough of person, having a short head of hair, wearing a garland"
4616,SECTION LVIII.,"composed of materials culled from a cemetery, his body bedaubed with"
4617,SECTION LVIII.,"ashes from the same quarter, he was decked out with iron ornaments. And,"
4618,SECTION LVIII.,"O Rāma, beholding him in the guise of a Chandāla, his counsellors as"
4619,SECTION LVIII.,"well as followers, renouncing him, fled in a body. And, Kākutstha,"
4620,SECTION LVIII.,"maintaining himself in patience, the monarch burning day and night, all"
4621,SECTION LVIII.,alone went unto the ascetic Viçwāmitra. And beholding the disappointed
4622,SECTION LVIII.,"king in the guise of a Chandāla, the ascetic O Rāma, was touched with"
4623,SECTION LVIII.,"pity. And from commiseration, that pre-eminently pious and exceedingly"
4624,SECTION LVIII.,"energetic one said unto that king frightful to behold, saying,—’Good"
4625,SECTION LVIII.,"betide thee, O heroic lord of Ayodhyā, thou hast fallen into"
4626,SECTION LVIII.,"Chandāla-hood through a curse, what is the purpose of thy coming, O"
4627,SECTION LVIII.,"highly powerful prince?’ Hearing him, the king conversant with words,"
4628,SECTION LVIII.,"fallen into Chandāla-hood, with folded hands, said unto that one versed"
4629,SECTION LVIII.,"in speech,—Disregarded had I been by my spiritual guide as well as his"
4630,SECTION LVIII.,"sons. And far from attaining my desire,I came by this calamity. O thou"
4631,SECTION LVIII.,"of placid presence, I had desired to repair unto heaven in body. By me"
4632,SECTION LVIII.,"have an hundred sacrifices been performed,—but yet do I not obtain the"
4633,SECTION LVIII.,fruit thereof. I have never before told an untruth; and I swear by my
4634,SECTION LVIII.,"Kshatriya morality, that albeit fallen on evil days, I will never do so"
4635,SECTION LVIII.,"in future, O gentle one. And sacrifices I have celebrated many,—and I"
4636,SECTION LVIII.,have ruled my people in righteousness; and I have pleased my preceptors
4637,SECTION LVIII.,"by my character and conduct. But, O best of ascetics, now endeavouring"
4638,SECTION LVIII.,"to do my duty and intending to perform a sacrifice, I have failed in"
4639,SECTION LVIII.,enlisting the good graces of my spiritual guides. Therefore do I
4640,SECTION LVIII.,consider Destiny as supreme; and action as nothing. Destiny overtaketh
4641,SECTION LVIII.,all: Destiny is the prime way. Therefore it behoveth thee to grant thy
4642,SECTION LVIII.,"favor unto me extremely distressed, who crave thy favor, and, good"
4643,SECTION LVIII.,"betide thee, whose endeavours have been baffled by Destiny. Other way"

4719,SECTION LX.,entered upon the ceremony; and in that sacrifice the highly energetic
4720,SECTION LX.,Viçwāmitra acted as the priest. And Ritwijas versed in _mantras_
4721,SECTION LX.,"performed every thing in order with _mantras_, in accordance with"

4732,SECTION LX.,"ascetic saying this, Kākutstha, that lord of men bodily ascended heaven"
4733,SECTION LX.,in the very sight of the anchorets. And beholding Trisanku risen to

4736,SECTION LX.,thou hast been blighted by the curse of thy spiritual guide. Do thou
4737,SECTION LX.,"therefore drop down headlong.’ The great Indra having spoken thus,"
4738,SECTION LX.,"Trisanku fell down, crying unto the ascetic Viçwāmitra,— ’Save me, save"
4739,SECTION LX.,"me.’ Thereupon, hearing his distressful cries, Kauçika waxed mightily"
4740,SECTION LX.,"wroth, and exclaimed,—’Stay, stay.’ And in the midst of the ascetics,"
4741,SECTION LX.,"like unto another Prajāpati, he created other seven Rishis⁸⁴ on the"

4745,SECTION LX.,"And, saying,—’I will create another Indra, or the world (that I create)"
4746,SECTION LX.,"shall be without an Indra.’ And in anger, he went the length of creating"
4747,SECTION LX.,"celestials. Thereupon, in trepidation, the saints and the celestials and"
4748,SECTION LX.,"the Asuras humbly addressed the high- souled Viçwāmitra thus,—’This"

4908,SECTION LXIII.,"spoken thus unto him, the lord of celestials returned to heaven. And"
4909,SECTION LXIII.,Viçwāmitra of mighty energy became again engaged in rigid austerities.
4910,SECTION LXIII.,"And, O foremost of men, it came to pass that after a long lapse of time"
4911,SECTION LXIII.,"that prime of Apsarās, Menakā, was at that time performing her ablutions"

4914,SECTION LXIII.,"spoke unto her, saying,—’O Apsari, hath thy journey been a pleasant one"
4915,SECTION LXIII.,"t Do thou abide in my asylum. Do thou favor me; for, good betide thee, I"
4916,SECTION LXIII.,"have been rendered senseless by Madana.’⁹⁰ Thus addressed, that one of"
4917,SECTION LXIII.,shapely hips began to dwell there. And mighty was the hinderance that
4918,SECTION LXIII.,"befell Viçwāmitra as regarded his asceticism, as she, O Rāghava, staying"
4919,SECTION LXIII.,"in that asylum of his, pleasantly spent five and five years, O gentle"
4920,SECTION LXIII.,"one. And after this period had gone by, overwhelmed with shame and"
4921,SECTION LXIII.,"afflicted with anxiety and grief, the mighty ascetic Viçwāmitra"
4922,SECTION LXIII.,"impatiently thought, O son of Raghu, that all this mighty loss of"
4923,SECTION LXIII.,austerities was the work of the celestials. And deprived of his senses
4924,SECTION LXIII.,"by lust, the decade had passed away imperceptibly as if it were one day"
4925,SECTION LXIII.,and night; and this impediment stood in the way of his austerities. And
4926,SECTION LXIII.,"heaving a sigh, that best of ascetics burned in repentance. And with"
4927,SECTION LXIII.,"sweet words, renouncing the terrible and trembling Menakā standing wuh"
4928,SECTION LXIII.,"clasped hands, Kuçika’s son, Viçwāmitra, O Rāma, went to the northern"
4929,SECTION LXIII.,mountains. And practising the Brahmacharyya mode of lite with the
4930,SECTION LXIII.,"intention of subduing lust, that highly famous one engaged in arduous"
4931,SECTION LXIII.,austerities on the banks of the Kauçiki. And as he was thus engaged in
4932,SECTION LXIII.,"profound austerities on the northern mountain, a thousand years, O Rāma"
4933,SECTION LXIII.,"passed away. Then taking counsel together, the celestials and the saints"
4934,SECTION LXIII.,"appeared before (Brahmā), saying,—’Let Kuçika’s son obtain the title of"
4935,SECTION LXIII.,"Maharshi.’ Hearing the words of the celestials, the Grand-sire of all"
4936,SECTION LXIII.,"addressed the ascetic Viçwāmitra, in these sweet words,—O mighty saint,"
4937,SECTION LXIII.,"hast thou had a pleasant journey? Satisfied with thy fierce austerities,"
4938,SECTION LXIII.,"O Kauçika, I confer upon thee the eminence of the foremost saintship.’"
4939,SECTION LXIII.,"Hearing Brahmā’s speech, the anchoret Viçwāmitra bowing down thus"

4942,SECTION LXIII.,thou hast not addressed me (by that title) it appears that I have not

5137,SECTION LXVI.,"well-pleased with them, he conferred this upon those high-souled ones."
5138,SECTION LXVI.,And even this is that jewel of a bow belonging to the high-souled god of
5139,SECTION LXVI.,"gods, and which was ultimately, O lord, consigned as a trust unto our"
5140,SECTION LXVI.,"ancestor. And as I was ploughing the mead, arose a damsel,—and as I"
5141,SECTION LXVI.,"obtained her while hallowing the field (for sacrifice), she hath come to"
5142,SECTION LXVI.,"be known by the name of Sitā. And arising from the earth, she grew as my"
5143,SECTION LXVI.,"daughter. And unsprung from the usual source, she was then established"

5150,SECTION LXVI.,"a body began to flock to Mithilā, desirous of being acquainted with the"
5151,SECTION LXVI.,"strength of the bow. And on their being curious (as to the bow), I"

5499,SECTION LXXII.,"thou, O foremost of men, listen to my words. This youthful brother of"
5500,SECTION LXXII.,"thine, king Kuçadhwaja, O thou versed in morality, this pious-souled"
5501,SECTION LXXII.,"one, O king, hath, O prime of men, a couple of daughters, unparalleled"
5502,SECTION LXXII.,"on earth in beauty, whom we would ask for, to become wives unto the"
5503,SECTION LXXII.,"prince Bharata and the intelligent Satrughna; as we, O king, ask for"
5504,SECTION LXXII.,thine own daughters in the interests of those high-souled ones (Rāma and
5505,SECTION LXXII.,Lakshmana). And these sons of Daçarātha are endeued with youth and
5506,SECTION LXXII.,"beauty, resembling the Lokapālas, and possessed of the prowess of"
5507,SECTION LXXII.,"celestials. Therefore do thou, O foremost of sovereigns, by this"
5508,SECTION LXXII.,"alliance with both the brothers, bind the Ikshwāku race. And in this may"
5509,SECTION LXXII.,"thy mind never waver!"" Hearing Viçwāmitra’s words embodying’ the"
5510,SECTION LXXII.,"sentiments of Vasishtha, Janaka with clasped hands addressed both the"
5511,SECTION LXXII.,"potent ascetics, saying,—""I consider my line as blessed; since such"
5512,SECTION LXXII.,"puissant ascetics wish for such a desirable alliance. Whatever ye wish,"
5513,SECTION LXXII.,"even that shall be done, good betide ye. Let these daughters of"
5514,SECTION LXXII.,Kuçadhwaja together become the wives of Satrughna and Bharata. On the
5515,SECTION LXXII.,"same day, O mighty Muni, let the four highly powerful princes espouse"
5516,SECTION LXXII.,the hands of the four princesses. The learned consider bridal celebrated
5517,SECTION LXXII.,on the day succeeding those on which the Phalgunis are on the
5518,SECTION LXXII.,"ascendant,—and having for its presiding deity Bhaga—as the most"
5519,SECTION LXXII.,"auspicious."" Having said these amiable words, king Janaka arose, and"
5520,SECTION LXXII.,"with clasped hands addressed both the foremost of ascetics, saying,—""I"
5521,SECTION LXXII.,"have reaped high religious merit (by these nuptials), and I also am your"
5522,SECTION LXXII.,"disciple. And do ye, ye anchorets, occupy these best of thrones,"
5523,SECTION LXXII.,"(belonging to us). And even as this kingdom is unto Daçarātha, is"
5524,SECTION LXXII.,Ayodhyā unto myself. Do ye not therefore entertain any doubts as to your
5525,SECTION LXXII.,"lordship. Do ye therefore do as it behoveth ye."" And as Vaideha Janaka"
5526,SECTION LXXII.,"was speaking thus, Raghu’s son, king Daçarātha, well pleased answered"
5527,SECTION LXXII.,"that monarch, saying, —""Countless are the excellences that pertain to ye"
5528,SECTION LXXII.,"brothers, lords of Mithilā""; and saints and sovereigns are ever honored"
5529,SECTION LXXII.,"by ye,⁹⁹ auspiciousness be yours. Good betide ye, I will repair unto my"
5530,SECTION LXXII.,"own quarters, there to duly perform the Srāddha ceremonies."" Then having"
5531,SECTION LXXII.,"greeted that king of men, the illustrious Daçarātha, placing those"
5532,SECTION LXXII.,"foremost of ascetics in his front, went away. And reaching his quarters,"
5533,SECTION LXXII.,"the king performed the Srāddha according to the ordinance, arose the"
5534,SECTION LXXII.,"next morning, and completed _Godana_ ceremony in consonance with the"
5535,SECTION LXXII.,time. And to Brāhmanas the monarch severally gave away kine by hundreds
5536,SECTION LXXII.,"and by thousands, for the welfare of his sons. And that puissant one"
5537,SECTION LXXII.,gave away unto the regenerate ones four hundred thousands of kine
5538,SECTION LXXII.,"furnished with horns plated with gold, and each having her"
5539,SECTION LXXII.,"calf,—together with bell-metal vessels for milking them. And that"
5540,SECTION LXXII.,descendant of Raghu addicted to his sons made presents of various other
5541,SECTION LXXII.,"valuables unto the Brāhmanas, on behalf of his sons. And having given"
5542,SECTION LXXII.,"away kine, the king surrounded by his sons looked like unto the amiable"

5563,SECTION LXXII.,"well.’ And, O foremost of kings, desirous of seeing my nephew (Bharata)"
5564,SECTION LXXII.,"that lord of earth repaired to Ayodhyā, O descendant of Raghu. And"
5565,SECTION LXXII.,"learning at Ayodhyā that thy sons for the purpose of marriage had, O"

5568,SECTION LXXII.,
5569,SECTION LXXII.,"Then king Daçarātha, on having that dear guest with him, rendered unto"

5572,SECTION LXXII.,"arose in the morning, and having disposed of his daily duties,"
5573,SECTION LXXII.,"approached the entrance of the sacrificial ground, headed by the saints."
5574,SECTION LXXII.,"Then at an auspicious moment called Vijaya, Rāma with Vasishtha as well"

5576,SECTION LXXII.,"with various ornaments, who had all performed the rites relative to"
5577,SECTION LXXII.,"their nuptials, (approached the entrance of the sacrificial ground)."
5578,SECTION LXXII.,"Then the worshipful Vasishtha, coming unto Vaideha, spake as"

5581,SECTION LXXII.,"relative to their nuptials, stayeth the orders of the bestower (of the"
5582,SECTION LXXII.,bride); for the meeting of the giver and the receiver is indispensable
5583,SECTION LXXII.,to every transaction (of this nature). Do thou therefore maintain thy
5584,SECTION LXXII.,"merit by accomplishing this excellent nuptial ceremony."" Thus addressed"
5585,SECTION LXXII.,"by the high-souled Vasishtha, that exceedingly generous and energetic"
5586,SECTION LXXII.,"one versed in morality answered, saying,—""Who acts as my warder there?"
5587,SECTION LXXII.,And whose commands doth he stay? And what need of exercising judgment in
5588,SECTION LXXII.,"entering one’s own house? As this kingdom is mine, so it is verily"
5589,SECTION LXXII.,"thine. O foremost of anchorets, my daughters resembling flames of fire,"
5590,SECTION LXXII.,"having performed all the rites relative to the incoming nuptials, are at"
5591,SECTION LXXII.,"the foot of the dais; and, sitting beside the dais, I myself had been"
5592,SECTION LXXII.,expecting thee every moment. Do thou perform everything without let.
5593,SECTION LXXII.,"What need of delaying further?"" Hearing those words uttered by Janaka,"
5594,SECTION LXXII.,Daçarātha entered in together with his sons and the body of saints. Then
5595,SECTION LXXII.,"unto the king of the Videhas, Vasishtha spake as follows,—""O saint, do"
5596,SECTION LXXII.,"thou, O pious one, in company with the saints perform, O master, the"

5598,SECTION LXXII.,"it"" unto Janaka, the worshipful saint Vasishtha of mighty austerities"
5599,SECTION LXXII.,"with Viçwāmitra and the pious Satānanda in his front, constructed a dais"
5600,SECTION LXXII.,"agreeably to the scriptures, decking it out with fragrant flowers all"

5607,SECTION LXXII.,"placing fire upon the dais, the highly energetic one commenced upon"
5608,SECTION LXXII.,offering oblations. Then bringing Sitā adorned with various ornaments
5609,SECTION LXXII.,"near the fire, and placing her before Rāghava, king Janaka addressed the"
5610,SECTION LXXII.,"enhancer of Kauçalya’s joy, saying,—""This Sitā, my daughter, do thou"
5611,SECTION LXXII.,"accept, good betide thee, as thy partner in the observance of every"
5612,SECTION LXXII.,"duty: do thou take her hand by thine. May she be of exalted piety, and"
5613,SECTION LXXII.,"devoted to her husband; ever following thee like thy shadow!"" saying"
5614,SECTION LXXII.,"this, the king sprinkled Rāma’s palm with water sanctified with"
5615,SECTION LXXII.,"_mantras_; with the celestials and saints exclaiming,—""Excellent!"
5616,SECTION LXXII.,"Excellent!"" And the celestial kettle-drums sounded, and blossoms began"
5617,SECTION LXXII.,"to shower down copiously. Having thus given away his daughter Sitā, with"
5618,SECTION LXXII.,"water and _mantras_, king Janaka overflowing with delight, said,—""Come"
5619,SECTION LXXII.,"forward, O Lakshmana, good unto thee. Receive thou Urmilā ready to be"
5620,SECTION LXXII.,bestowed by me upon thee. Do thou accept her hand: let there be no delay
5621,SECTION LXXII.,"about it."" Having addressed Lakshmana thus, Janaka spake unto Bharata,"
5622,SECTION LXXII.,"saying,—""Do thou, O descendant of Raghu, take Mandavyā’s hand by thine"
5623,SECTION LXXII.,"own."" And the righteous lord of Mithilā spake also unto Satrughna,"
5624,SECTION LXXII.,"saying,—""Do thou, O thou of mighty arms, take Srutakirti’s hand by thine"
5625,SECTION LXXII.,"own. May ye all be good, and vowed unto excellent life! and be, ye"

5627,SECTION LXXII.,"Hearing Janaka’s speech, those four perpetuators of Raghu’s line,"
5628,SECTION LXXII.,"staying by Vasishtha’s opinions, taking the hands of the four brides"
5629,SECTION LXXII.,"with their owil, went round the sacrificial fire, and the dais, and the"
5630,SECTION LXXII.,"king, and the high-souled saints; and in company with their wives,"
5631,SECTION LXXII.,agreeably to direction entered into matrimony in accordance with the

5634,SECTION LXXII.,choiring and instrumental music. And the Apsarās danced and the
5635,SECTION LXXII.,"Gandharbas sang melodiously, at the bridal of the foremost of the"
5636,SECTION LXXII.,Raghus. And this seemed wonderful to witness. And to the blowing of
5637,SECTION LXXII.,"trumpets, those exceedingly puissant ones, thrice going round the fire,"
5638,SECTION LXXII.,"in company with their wives went to the encampment. And the king,having"

5650,SECTION LXXIV.,"Vaideha, actively prepared for setting out for his own capital. And then"
5651,SECTION LXXIV.,the king of the Videhas gave a dower consisting of various things. And
5652,SECTION LXXIV.,"Mithilā’s lord gave many hundred thousands of kine, and excellent woolen"
5653,SECTION LXXIV.,"stuffs, and _Kotis_ of common cloths; and elephants, and horses, and"
5654,SECTION LXXIV.,"cars, and foot men, as well as an hundred damsels adorned, endowed with"
5655,SECTION LXXIV.,"elegance, to form goodly waiting-maids. And well- pleased the king gave"
5656,SECTION LXXIV.,as a noble dower gold and silver and pearls and coral. And having given
5657,SECTION LXXIV.,"divers kinds of articles, that king, the lord of Mithilā, bidding adieu"
5658,SECTION LXXIV.,"to the monarch (Daçarātha), re-entered his own capital. And the master"
5659,SECTION LXXIV.,"of Ayodhyā accompanied with his high-souled sons, and headed by the"
5660,SECTION LXXIV.,"saints in a body, started on the journey, followed by his army and"
5661,SECTION LXXIV.,"attendants. And as that tiger-like one was on his way, in company with"
5662,SECTION LXXIV.,"Rāghava and the saints, the fowls began to utter frightful cries all"
5663,SECTION LXXIV.,"around, and the beasts on earth to stream in a Southern direction. And"
5664,SECTION LXXIV.,"beholding them, that tiger like monarch asked Vasishtha, saying,— ""Those"
5665,SECTION LXXIV.,birds of fierce aspects emit frightful cries and beasts stream in a
5666,SECTION LXXIV.,Southerly direction. What is this? My heart trembleth and my mind is not
5667,SECTION LXXIV.,"at ease."" Hearing the speech of king Daçarātha, that mighty saint spake"
5668,SECTION LXXIV.,"sweetly, saying, ""Hear what would be the result of it. These fowls of"
5669,SECTION LXXIV.,the air by their cries presage some dreadful impending evil; but these
5670,SECTION LXXIV.,"beasts betoken peace restored. Therefore do thou renounce anxiety."" And"
5671,SECTION LXXIV.,"as they were thus conversing, there blew a strong wind, shaking all the"
5672,SECTION LXXIV.,"earth, and breaking down the trees. And a deep gloom enveloped the sun;"
5673,SECTION LXXIV.,"and no quarter could be discovered. And enveloped in ashes, that host"
5674,SECTION LXXIV.,"became stupified. And at that dreadful hour, Vasishtha and the other"
5675,SECTION LXXIV.,"saints and the king with his sons alone retained their senses, all else"
5676,SECTION LXXIV.,"were deprived of their senses, and the army was enveloped with ashes."
5677,SECTION LXXIV.,"And the king saw that repressor of kings, the decendant of Bhrigu,"
5678,SECTION LXXIV.,"Jamadagni’s son, dreadful to behold, wearing a head of matted locks,"
5679,SECTION LXXIV.,"irrepresible like unto Kailāça, and unbearable like unto the fire at the"
5680,SECTION LXXIV.,"universal dissolution, flaming fn energy, incapable of being looked at"
5681,SECTION LXXIV.,"by the unrighteous, with his axe on his shoulder, equipped with a bow"
5682,SECTION LXXIV.,"like unto the lightning, and fierce arrows, looking like Sivā the slayer"
5683,SECTION LXXIV.,of Tripura. And beholding him of dreadful appearance like unto flaming
5684,SECTION LXXIV.,"fire, the Vipras headed by Viçwāmitra, engaged in reciting _mantras_ and"
5685,SECTION LXXIV.,"offering oblations unto the fire,— those saints assembled together—began"
5686,SECTION LXXIV.,"to converse with each other., saying,—""Is this one, enraged because of"

5688,SECTION LXXIV.,"Formerly, having slaughtered the Kshatriyas, he pacified his ire and"
5689,SECTION LXXIV.,"mental ferment,—therefore, to annihilate the Kshatriyas once again can"

5691,SECTION LXXIV.,unto Bhrigu’s son of dreadful appearance; and addressed him in soothing
5692,SECTION LXXIV.,"words, saying,—""O Rāma! O Rāma."" Accepting that homage rendered unto him"

5703,SECTION LXXV.,"having heard of that wonderful and inconceivable breaking of the bow, I"
5704,SECTION LXXV.,"have bent my steps hither, taking another auspicious bow. Do thou"

5707,SECTION LXXV.,"might in stretching the bow, I shall offer thee combat, laying under"
5708,SECTION LXXV.,"contribution our utmost strength."" Hearing his words, king Daçarātha"
5709,SECTION LXXV.,"with a blank countenance, and clasped hands, said,—""Thou hast quenched"
5710,SECTION LXXV.,"thy ire against the Kshatriyas; and, moreover, thou art a Brāhmana"
5711,SECTION LXXV.,boasting of high austerities. It therefore behoveth thee to dispel the

5717,SECTION LXXV.,"O mighty _Muni_, thou hast come here to compass the destruction of my"

5720,SECTION LXXV.,"addressed Rāma,—""These two foremost of bows, extraordinary, and"
5721,SECTION LXXV.,"worshipped of all the worlds, and stout, and powerful, surpassingly"
5722,SECTION LXXV.,"excellent, were constructed with care by Viçwakarmā. And, one of these,"

5724,SECTION LXXV.,"unto Tramvaka, desirous of encounter,—even that which, O Kākutstha, thou"
5725,SECTION LXXV.,"hast snapped. And this second, which is irrepressible, was given to"
5726,SECTION LXXV.,"Vishnu, by the chiefs of the celestials. And, O Rāma, this bow belonging"
5727,SECTION LXXV.,"unto Vishnu, capable of conquering hostile cities, is, O Kākutstha,"
5728,SECTION LXXV.,equal in energy unto the bow belonging unto Rudra. Once on a time the
5729,SECTION LXXV.,"deities, with the object of ascertaining the respective prowess of"
5730,SECTION LXXV.,"Vishnu and the blue-throated one, asked the great father, about it."
5731,SECTION LXXV.,"Thereupon the great father,foremost of those abiding by truth —reading"

5736,SECTION LXXV.,"Vishnu uttering a roar, Sivā’s bow of dreadful prowess became flaccid."
5737,SECTION LXXV.,And thereupon the three-eyed Mahādeva became moveless. And upon the
5738,SECTION LXXV.,assembled gods with the saints and the Charanas beseeching those two

5740,SECTION LXXV.,"bow of Sivā rendered flaccid by Vishnu’s prowess, the deities with the"
5741,SECTION LXXV.,saints acknowledged Vishnu as the more powerful. And the enraged Rudra
5742,SECTION LXXV.,of high fame made over the bow along with its shafts unto the hands of
5743,SECTION LXXV.,"the Rājarshi, Devarata of Videha. And, O Rāma, this bow belonging to"
5744,SECTION LXXV.,"Vishnu, capable of conquering hostile cities, Vishnu consigned to"
5745,SECTION LXXV.,"Bhrigu’s son, Richika, as a worthy trust. And the exceedingly energetic"
5746,SECTION LXXV.,"Richika made over the divine bow unto his son of immeasurable prowess,"
5747,SECTION LXXV.,"my sire the high-souled son of Jamadagni. And once on a time, on my sire"

5756,SECTION LXXV.,"speedily come hither. Do thou now, O Rāma, agreeably to the cannon of"
5757,SECTION LXXV.,"the Kshatriya morality, take this excellent and mighty bow of Vishnu,"
5758,SECTION LXXV.,that had belonged to my father and grand-father. And do thou set upon

5916,SECTION I.,incomparable on earth and in worth fully equal to Daçarātha himself. He

5919,SECTION I.,yet he returned no corresponding reply. He was gratified even with a

5922,SECTION I.,"discoursed with persons of character, or wise men, or the aged, or the"
5923,SECTION I.,"virtuous. He was intelligent, and sweet-speeched, and spoke first (to"

5925,SECTION I.,withal not proud of his mighty native virtue. He never spoke an untruth;
5926,SECTION I.,and he was learned; and he rendered homage unto the aged. He felt kindly

5929,SECTION I.,regarded the Brāhmanas; and he commisserated the wretched; and was

5932,SECTION I.,regarded highly his own Kshatriya duties; and considered that heaven was

5940,SECTION I.,the subjects like their life ranging externally. He had performed his
5941,SECTION I.,ablutions after having mastered all learning; and was properly versed in
5942,SECTION I.,the Vedas with their branches. In all weapons either inspired with
5943,SECTION I.,"_mantras_ or otherwise, Bharata’s eldest brother was superior even to"

5973,SECTION I.,malicious. He did not disregard any creature; he was no slave to the
5974,SECTION I.,times. That son of the monarch was furnished with such qualities. And he
5975,SECTION I.,was liked by the subjects as well as by the three worlds. In forgiveness
5976,SECTION I.,he was like unto the Earth; and in intelligence like unto Vrihaspati;

5978,SECTION I.,"acceptable to the people as well as gratifying unto his father, Rāma"
5979,SECTION I.,looked beautiful like the effulgent Sun surrounded by his rays. And the
5980,SECTION I.,Earth desired for her lord even him (Rāma) possessing an excellent
5981,SECTION I.,character and of prow’ess incapable of being repressed—like unto
5982,SECTION I.,Lokanātha¹⁰⁵ himself.
5983,SECTION I.,
5984,SECTION I.,"And finding his son crowmed wdth so many incomparable qualities,that"

5987,SECTION I.,living; and how can this delight be mine?” And this supreme desire
5988,SECTION I.,"rolled in his heart,—“When shall I behold my beloved son installed¹⁰⁶ in"
5989,SECTION I.,the kingdom? Surely he always wisheth for the prosperity of the people;
5990,SECTION I.,and he showeth kindness to all creatures. And like unto the showering
5991,SECTION I.,rain-cloudy he is dearer unto the people than myself. He is like unto
5992,SECTION I.,"Yama and Sakra in prowess, and unto Vrihaspati in intelligence; and in"
5993,SECTION I.,"forbearance, unto a mountain,—yea, he is far more qualified than myself."
5994,SECTION I.,"Therefore in this age, beholding my son established in (the dominion of)"

5996,SECTION I.,crowned with all these various as well as other sterling and
5997,SECTION I.,"immeasurable virtues rare among other princes, the king then took"
5998,SECTION I.,"counsel with his ministers, and made up his mind to confer upon Rāma the"

6000,SECTION I.,his minister) the dreadful evils portended by appearances and phenomena
6001,SECTION I.,in heaven and the air and on the earth; and also pointed out the
6002,SECTION I.,circumstance of decrepitude having taken possession of his person. He
6003,SECTION I.,therefore gave them to understand that the installation of the high
6004,SECTION I.,souled Rāma of countenance resembling the full moon would dispell his
6005,SECTION I.,"grief, at the same time that it would be universally hailed by the"
6006,SECTION I.,"people. Therefore, influenced by his affection (for his subject,) and"
6007,SECTION I.,"with the view of compassing his own as well as their welfare, the"
6008,SECTION I.,righteous monarch urged expedition (upon his counsellors;) and that lord
6009,SECTION I.,of earth brought together the prime and noble from the Various regions
6010,SECTION I.,and countries of the earth. Like unto Prajāpati’s self before all
6011,SECTION I.,"creatures, the king appeared before them, who had been received"
6012,SECTION I.,"respectfully, and had, as befitted their ranks, various ornaments"
6013,SECTION I.,conferred upon and quarters assigned unto them. But that lord of men did
6014,SECTION I.,"not, on account of haste,bring over either Janaka or the king of the"
6015,SECTION I.,"Kekayas, concluding that a little while after they would receive the"
6016,SECTION I.,glad tidings.
6017,SECTION I.,

6054,SECTION II.,mellifluous; and peerless; and surcharged with the sentiment of
6055,SECTION II.,"surprise, the monarch addressed the princes, saying,—""It is known to ye"

6067,SECTION II.,of duty incapable of being borne by even those that have controlled
6068,SECTION II.,"their senses, and requiring (in the bearer) right royal qualities, I"

6078,SECTION II.,"ye,—yea, the very three worlds might consider themselves as having a"

6080,SECTION II.,the welfare of the world; and shall renounce my toil by reposing in him

6088,SECTION II.,"As the king had said this, the princes, exceedingly delighted, seconded"

6097,SECTION II.,"unanimous,—and, having again revolved the matter individually in their"

6112,SECTION II.,"meritorious and intelligent (Rāma) resembling a celestial. O monarch,"
6113,SECTION II.,"furnished with the choicest qualities, Rāma having truth for prowess is"
6114,SECTION II.,like unto Sakrā’s self; and he towereth above Ikshwāku and all. Rāma is
6115,SECTION II.,the one excellent person among men; and is true and devoted to truth.
6116,SECTION II.,And in very Rāma is established morality with prosperity. Touching the
6117,SECTION II.,"good of the subjects, he is like unto the moon, and in the quality of"
6118,SECTION II.,"forgiveness, he is like unto the Earth; in intelligence like unto"
6119,SECTION II.,"Vrihaspati; and in prowess like Sachi’s lord. He is cognizant of duty,"
6120,SECTION II.,"and true in promise,— and honest; and not given to detraction. He is"
6121,SECTION II.,"forgiving, and soothing, and sweet-speeched and grateful, and of subdued"
6122,SECTION II.,"senses. He is pliable to entreaties and staid, and of agreeable"
6123,SECTION II.,"carriage, and uncalumniating. Rāghava speaketh everyone fair, and is of"
6124,SECTION II.,truthful speech. He minstereth unto variously-versed aged Brāhmanas. It
6125,SECTION II.,is for this that in this world his fame and renown and energy go on
6126,SECTION II.,increasing. He hath mastered all the weapons that are extant among the
6127,SECTION II.,"gods, the Asuras, and human beings. He hath performed his ablutions"
6128,SECTION II.,after having acquired learning; and knoweth the Vedas with their
6129,SECTION II.,branches. And Bharata’s elder brother is a proficient in music. He is
6130,SECTION II.,"the home of the good, and is saintly, and hath conquered his grief, and"
6131,SECTION II.,is magnanimous. He is lowly unto those twice born ones that are worthy
6132,SECTION II.,and are conversant with morality and interest. And when in company with
6133,SECTION II.,Sumitrā’s son he wendeth to the fight with the view of protecting a city
6134,SECTION II.,"or a province, he cometh not back without conquering the foe. And even"
6135,SECTION II.,"as a father enquireth after the welfare of his sons, he, returning from"
6136,SECTION II.,"the field on horse or elephant, exhaustively and consecutively enquireth"
6137,SECTION II.,"after the weal of the citizens, concerning their sons, or their"
6138,SECTION II.,"(sacrificial) fire, or their wives, or their servants, or their"
6139,SECTION II.,"disciples. And that tiger- like Rāma always asketh the Brāhmanas,—’Do"
6140,SECTION II.,your disciples tend you’ and the Kshatriyas—’Do your disciples always
6141,SECTION II.,"remain mailed?’ When calamity befalleth the people, he experienced"
6142,SECTION II.,"excess of sorrow; and on their festal occasions, he rejoiceth ever like"
6143,SECTION II.,"their own father. He speaketh the truth, and is a mighty bowman. He"
6144,SECTION II.,"ministereth unto the aged, and hath controlled his senses. He. preludes"
6145,SECTION II.,"his speech with a smile, and is established in righteousness with his"
6146,SECTION II.,"whole soul. He entirely bringeth about good, and he taketh no delight in"
6147,SECTION II.,"bandying words after a quarrel. In reasoning in chain, he is like unto"
6148,SECTION II.,the lord of speech himself. His eye-brows are graceful; and his eyes
6149,SECTION II.,expansive and coppery; and he is like unto the very Vishnu. Like Kāma he
6150,SECTION II.,"is charming unto all by virtue of his heroism, prowess and might. He is"
6151,SECTION II.,ever engaged in protecting the people: and the desire for the good
6152,SECTION II.,things of the world cannot perturb his mind. He is capable of bearing
6153,SECTION II.,"the burden even of the three worlds,—what then is this Earth? Neither"
6154,SECTION II.,his pleasure nor his displeasure even goeth for naught. He slayeth those
6155,SECTION II.,that deserve to be slain; but he is never enraged with those that ought
6156,SECTION II.,"not to be slain (i.e. the unoffending),—with whom, he is pleased, he"
6157,SECTION II.,bestows wealth upon. In virtue of his self-control and other qualities;
6158,SECTION II.,"dear unto the subjects and capable of exciting the delight of mankind,"
6159,SECTION II.,Rāma shineth even like the effulgent Sun surrounded by his rays. And
6160,SECTION II.,"even that Rāma, crowned with such qualities and having truth for his"
6161,SECTION II.,"prowess,—like unto a Lokapāla, the Earth wisheth to have for her lord."
6162,SECTION II.,By our good luck it is that thy son hath acquired competence in the task
6163,SECTION II.,of administration; and also by thy good luck it is that Rāghava hath
6164,SECTION II.,"been born endowed with sonly qualities, like unto Maricha’s son Kāçyapa."
6165,SECTION II.,"The gods, and the Asuras, and men, with the Gandharvas, and the Uragas,"
6166,SECTION II.,"and the inhabitants rural and urban, pray for the strength, health, and"
6167,SECTION II.,"long life of self-knowing Rāma. And whether inmates or outsiders,"
6168,SECTION II.,"citizens or natives of provinces, everyone speaks high of him. Women,"
6169,SECTION II.,"old and young, in both the morning and evening, with intent minds, bow"
6170,SECTION II.,down unto all the gods on behalf of the intelligent Rāma. Let their
6171,SECTION II.,"desire, O worshipful one, be fulfiled, through thy grace. And we would"
6172,SECTION II.,"behold the son of the foremost of monarchs, the foe-destroying Rāma"
6173,SECTION II.,"dark-blue like a lotus,—installed as the heir-apparent to the kingdom."
6174,SECTION II.,"Therefore, O bestower of boons, it behoveth thee, for the sake of our"
6175,SECTION II.,"well-being, with a delighted mind to speedily instal thy son furnished"
6176,SECTION II.,"with noble qualities resembling the god of gods, and ever intent upon"
6177,SECTION II.,the welfare of the entire community.”

6185,SECTION II.,expressed. _The thought of the disspassionate is different from

6194,SECTION III.,And when they had raised unto their heads their clasped hands resembling
6195,SECTION III.,"lotuses, the king responding unto them addressed them in welcome words"
6196,SECTION III.,"fraught with their good; ""Exceedingly pleased am I, and incomparable"
6197,SECTION III.,"also is my influence,—because ye wish to behold my dear first born"
6198,SECTION III.,"installed as heir-apparent."" Having greeted them thus, the king in their"
6199,SECTION III.,"hearing spoke unto Vasishtha, Vāmadeva, and other Brāhmanas"
6200,SECTION III.,"saying,—""This is the holy month of Chaitra; and the groves look"
6201,SECTION III.,beautiful with blossoms. Do ye now prepare for the installation of
6202,SECTION III.,"Rāma."" When the king paused, there arose a mighty tumult from the"
6203,SECTION III.,"multitude. And when it subsided, that lord of men, the king, addressed"
6204,SECTION III.,"that foremost of ascetics, Vasishtha saying,—""It behovcth thee, O"
6205,SECTION III.,"worshipful Sir, to order for things, necessary for the installation of"
6206,SECTION III.,"Rāma."" Hearing those words of the monarch, Vasishtha—chief of"
6207,SECTION III.,anchorets—ordered the counsellors staying before the king with clasped
6208,SECTION III.,"hands, saying,—""Do ye early in the morning in the Agnihautric ball of"
6209,SECTION III.,"the monarch provide and store up- gold, and gems, and articles for"
6210,SECTION III.,"worship, and _Sarvaushadhi_¹⁰⁹ and white garlands, and fried paddy, and"
6211,SECTION III.,"honey and clarified butter in separate vessels, and cloths fresh from"
6212,SECTION III.,"the loom, and a car, every kind of weapons, and the fourfold forces, and"
6213,SECTION III.,"an elephant with auspicious marks, and a couple of chowris, and a"
6214,SECTION III.,"sceptre and an umbrella, pale colored, and an hundred furnished golden"
6215,SECTION III.,"pitchers of water, and a bull with horns plated in gold, and an entire"
6216,SECTION III.,"tiger-skin, together with all othet necessary articles. And do ye"
6217,SECTION III.,embellish all the door-ways of the inner apartment as well as those of
6218,SECTION III.,"the entire city with garlands, with sandal paste and fragrant _Dhupa_."
6219,SECTION III.,Do ye on the morning of the morrow bestow upon the principal Brāhmanas
6220,SECTION III.,goodly and refined rice mixed with curds and milk.—so that hundreds of
6221,SECTION III.,"thousands may be fed, and gratified, bestowing on them at the same time"
6222,SECTION III.,"clarified butter and curds, and fried paddy, and moire than sufficient"
6223,SECTION III.,"_Dakshinas_. To-morrow as soon as the sun will rise, the"
6224,SECTION III.,"_Swastivachana_¹¹⁰ will be finished. Do ye invite the Brāhmanas, and"
6225,SECTION III.,"prepare seats (for them). And do ye set up flags, and water the high"
6226,SECTION III.,"ways, and let courtezans whose profession is music, adorning themselves"
6227,SECTION III.,stay in the second apartment of the king’s residence. In the abodes of
6228,SECTION III.,"the gods and under the Chaitya¹¹¹ trees, should be separately placed"
6229,SECTION III.,"fragrant blossoms, together with boiled rice and other edibles, and with"
6230,SECTION III.,"_Dakshinas_. And let the warriors properly arrayed, enter the courtyard"
6231,SECTION III.,"of the monarch which is welling up with festal glee mailed, and"
6232,SECTION III.,"accoutred with leather fences and long swords."" Having issued these"
6233,SECTION III.,"orders, those two Vipras entered upon their work (as priests;) and did"
6234,SECTION III.,what remained to be done after making that known unto the lord of the
6235,SECTION III.,earth. When everything had been got ready those foremost of the twice-
6236,SECTION III.,born ones gladly and well-pleased presented themselves before the master
6237,SECTION III.,"of the earth, and said unto him, ""Everything as ordered has been done."""
6238,SECTION III.,"Then unto Sumantra, the effulgent monarch spake, saying,—""Do thou"
6239,SECTION III.,"speedily bring the virtuous Rāma hither."" Thereupon saying, ""so be it,"""
6240,SECTION III.,Sumantra at the mandate of the king brought thither in a car Rāma the
6241,SECTION III.,"foremost of car-warriors. The kings of the North, and the South and the"
6242,SECTION III.,"East and the West, together with the _Mlechas_ and the Arya princes,"
6243,SECTION III.,with those inhabiting mountains and forests were then paying homage unto
6244,SECTION III.,him (Daçarātha) even as the celestials do unto Vāsava. Stationed in his
6245,SECTION III.,"palace, the royal saint Daçarātha in the midst of those princes, like"
6246,SECTION III.,"Vāsava in the midst of the Maruts, saw his son, resembling the king of"
6247,SECTION III.,"the Gandharvas, approach, gladdening the subjects like a shower, when"
6248,SECTION III.,they were oppressed with the heat of summer—even Rāma of redoubtable
6249,SECTION III.,"prowess among men, long armed, and of mighty strength, and bearing the"
6250,SECTION III.,"gait of a mad elephant, ""with a countenance fair as the moon, of"
6251,SECTION III.,"presence prepossessing to a degree, and captivating men’s sight and"
6252,SECTION III.,hearts by reason of his beauty generosity and other qualities. And as he
6253,SECTION III.,"was approaching, the lord of men eyed him steadily, without experiencing"
6254,SECTION III.,satiety.
6255,SECTION III.,
6256,SECTION III.,"Making Rāghava descend from that excellent car, Sumantra followed him"
6257,SECTION III.,with clasped hands as he proceeded to the presence of his father.
6258,SECTION III.,"Accompanied with Sumantra, Rāghava, the descendant of the Raghus, for"
6259,SECTION III.,"the purpose of beholding the monarch, began with rapid steps, to ascend"
6260,SECTION III.,the palace resembling a peak of the Kailāsa hill. Rāma humbly
6261,SECTION III.,"approaching his father with clasped hands, and announcing his name bowed"
6262,SECTION III.,low and worshipped his father’s feet. Thereupon seeing Rāma at his side
6263,SECTION III.,"with clasped hands, and in lowly guise, the king took hold of Rāma’s"
6264,SECTION III.,"clasped hands, and drawing his beloved son, embraced the latter. Then"
6265,SECTION III.,"the king desired Rāma to sit upon a seat prepared expressly for him,"
6266,SECTION III.,"excellent, and flaming and garnished with gold and gems. Rāghava shed"
6267,SECTION III.,"lustre on that noble seat, as the unclouded sun at his rising lighteth"
6268,SECTION III.,up the _Sumeru_ hill with his rays. That entire assembly looked
6269,SECTION III.,"beautiful in his presence, like the cloudless, autumnal sky crested with"
6270,SECTION III.,"stars and planets, in the presence of the moon. The king experienced"
6271,SECTION III.,"delight, beholding his dearly beloved son, like unto his own image,"
6272,SECTION III.,"richly adorned, reflected on mirror. And even as Kaçyapa addresseth"
6273,SECTION III.,"Indra of the celestials, the king—the best of those possessing sons—"
6274,SECTION III.,"addressed his son, well seated, in these words, saying. ""Born of my"
6275,SECTION III.,"eldest wife worthy of myself, thou crowned with the best qualities, art"
6276,SECTION III.,"my worthy son, O Rāma dear unto me. Thou hast by thy virtues drawn unto"
6277,SECTION III.,"thyself the hearts of the people, therefore do thou during the"
6278,SECTION III.,"conjunction of the moon with the Pushyā constellation, receive the"
6279,SECTION III.,office of heir-apparent. Thou art by nature crowned with virtues.
6280,SECTION III.,"Notwithstanding thy great virtues, I will, 0 son, from affection tell"
6281,SECTION III.,"thee what is for thy profit. Practicing greater humility, do thou"
6282,SECTION III.,constantly restrain thy senses. Do thou renounce the ills that come
6283,SECTION III.,"through anger and lust. Replenishing thy exchequer and arsenal do thou,"
6284,SECTION III.,"acquainting thyself with the state of things personally and otherwise,"
6285,SECTION III.,administer justice and thereby enlist the affection of the courtiers and
6286,SECTION III.,"other subjects; for the friends of him that swayeth the earth, pleasing"
6287,SECTION III.,"the people to his satisfaction, rejoice even as did the immortals on"
6288,SECTION III.,"obtaining ambrosia. Therefore, do thou, O son, disciplining thyself thus"
6289,SECTION III.,"address thee to thy task."" Hearing this, Rāma’s well wishers, ever doing"
6290,SECTION III.,"his pleasure, speedily going out, acquainted Kauçalya with everything."
6291,SECTION III.,Thereupon that foremost of her sex Kauçalya ordered gold and kine and
6292,SECTION III.,various kinds of gems to be given to the tellers of the glad tidings.
6293,SECTION III.,"Then Rāghava, having been honored by the multitude and saluted the"
6294,SECTION III.,"sovereign, ascended a car, and repaired unto his shining residence. And"
6295,SECTION III.,"the citizens, hearing those words of the monarch, as if fraught with"
6296,SECTION III.,"some speedy good fortune unto them, made their obeisance unto that lord"
6297,SECTION III.,"of men, and repairing to their homes, with delighted minds, worshipped"

6313,SECTION IV.,"When the citizens had gone away, the king versed in the time and place"
6314,SECTION IV.,"of ceremonies, after deliberating with his counsellors fixed the time"
6315,SECTION IV.,"(of the installation.) And his conclusion was even this: ""To-morrow the"
6316,SECTION IV.,"Pushyā will be in; and to-morrow should my son, Rāma of eyes like"
6317,SECTION IV.,"lotus-leaves be installed as heir-apparent."" Then entering the inner"
6318,SECTION IV.,"apartment king Daçarātha said unto the charioteer Sumantra,— ""Do thou"
6319,SECTION IV.,"again bring Rāma hither."" In response to those words, the charioteer"
6320,SECTION IV.,"again speedily went unto Rāma’s residence,for bringing him thither. His"
6321,SECTION IV.,"fresh approach having been announced unto Rāma by the warders, the"
6322,SECTION IV.,"latter, filled with apprehension, became anxious. And bringing Sumantra"
6323,SECTION IV.,"in, Rāma with eagerness said ""Tell me fully the reason of this thy fresh"
6324,SECTION IV.,"visit."" Thereupon, the charioteer told him,— ""The sovereign wisheth to"
6325,SECTION IV.,behold thee. Thou hast known the occasion; and now decide whether thou
6326,SECTION IV.,"wilt go thither or not."" Hearing the charioteer’s speech, Rāma also in"
6327,SECTION IV.,"haste repaired unto the king’s palace, with the view of again beholding"
6328,SECTION IV.,"the lord of men. And on hearing of Rāma’s arrival, king Daçarātha made"
6329,SECTION IV.,"him enter his own chamber, with the view of communicating unto him"
6330,SECTION IV.,something exceedingly agreeable. Aud immediately on entering his
6331,SECTION IV.,"father’s residence, the graceful Rāghava seeing his father from a"
6332,SECTION IV.,"distance, bent low with clasped hands. Thereupon raising Rāma as he was"
6333,SECTION IV.,"bending down, and embracing him, and pointing out a seat, the protector"
6334,SECTION IV.,"of the earth again spake unto him,— ""O Rāma, enjoying at my will the"
6335,SECTION IV.,"good things of life, I have grown old; and have attained great age. I"
6336,SECTION IV.,have worshipped the deities by celebrating hundreds of sacrifices with
6337,SECTION IV.,numerous _Dakshinas_ and gifts of boiled rice; and incomparable on
6338,SECTION IV.,"earth, thou hast been born unto me for a son after my heart. I have"
6339,SECTION IV.,"given whatever bad been wanted (by others); I have finished my studies,"
6340,SECTION IV.,"O foremost of men. I have, O hero, acted and enjoyed. I have been"
6341,SECTION IV.,"emancipated from my obligations unto the celestials and saints, and the"
6342,SECTION IV.,"_Pitris_, and the Vipras, and myself.¹¹² And naught now remaineth to be"
6343,SECTION IV.,done by me save thy installation. Therefore it behoveth thee to do even
6344,SECTION IV.,what I say unto thee. To-day the subjects in a body have expressed their
6345,SECTION IV.,"desire of having thee for their sovereign. Therefore, O son, I shall"
6346,SECTION IV.,"install thee as the heir-apparent. O Rāghava, to-night I have dreamt"
6347,SECTION IV.,"inauspicious dreams. Stars with tremendous sounds, shoot by day,"
6348,SECTION IV.,accompanied with thunder-claps. The astrologers say that the star of my
6349,SECTION IV.,"life hath been invaded by those terrible planets, the Sun, Mars, and"
6350,SECTION IV.,"Rāhu. It generally happens that when such signs manifest themselves, the"
6351,SECTION IV.,"king cometh by a terrible calamity, and may meet with death itself."
6352,SECTION IV.,"Therefore, O Rāghava, my thoughts change, be thou installed (in the"
6353,SECTION IV.,"kingdom), for fickle is the mind of all creatures. To-day, before"
6354,SECTION IV.,"meeting Pushyā, the moon, has entered the Punarvasu asterism; and the"
6355,SECTION IV.,astrologers say that to-morrow it will certainly be in conjunction with
6356,SECTION IV.,"Pushyā. My heart urgeth me to instal thee during the Pushyā conjunction,"
6357,SECTION IV.,"so Oh! afflicter of foes, I shall instal thee to-morrow as heir-"
6358,SECTION IV.,apparent. Therefore do thou along with my daughter-in-law commencing
6359,SECTION IV.,"from sun-set, serving the prescribed restrictions, and lying down on a"
6360,SECTION IV.,"bed of Kuça grass, spend the night in fast. And let thy friends"
6361,SECTION IV.,"vigilantly protect thee all around, for many are the impediments that"
6362,SECTION IV.,"happen in affairs like this. In my opinion, during the interval that"
6363,SECTION IV.,"Bharata is away from the city, should thy installation be effected most"
6364,SECTION IV.,opportunely; even though thy brother Bharata ever stayeth entirely by
6365,SECTION IV.,the course of the honest; he followeth his elder brother; and is
6366,SECTION IV.,righteous-souled; tender-hearted; and of subdued senses. But in my
6367,SECTION IV.,"opinion, the hearts of men are inconstant,—and, O Rāghava, the hearts"
6368,SECTION IV.,"even of the virtuous change by the action of the natural impulses."""
6369,SECTION IV.,Having been thus addressed in the matter of his coming installation in
6370,SECTION IV.,"the next day, Rāma, with the king’s permission embodied in ""Go thou,"""
6371,SECTION IV.,"greeting his father, repaired unto his quarters. And entering his"
6372,SECTION IV.,"residence in the interests of the installation ordered by the monarch,"
6373,SECTION IV.,"he immediately issued out, and went to the inner apartment of his"
6374,SECTION IV.,"mother. There, Rāma found his mother in the temple, clad in silk,"
6375,SECTION IV.,"adoring the gods, and silently praying for his royal luck. There,"
6376,SECTION IV.,"hearing of the welcome installation of Rāma, had already come Sumitrā,"
6377,SECTION IV.,and Lakshmana and Sitā summoned (by Kauçalyā). Hearing of the
6378,SECTION IV.,installation of his son in the office of heir apparent during the
6379,SECTION IV.,"influence of the Pushyā, at that time, tended by Sumitrā and Siti and"
6380,SECTION IV.,"Lakshmana, there stood Kauçalya, meditating the (triune) person"
6381,SECTION IV.,"Janārddana, through suspension of breath. Rāma, approaching and saluting"
6382,SECTION IV.,"her engaged in auspicious observance, addressed her in excellent words,"
6383,SECTION IV.,"cheering her up,—""O mother, by my father have I been appointed to the"
6384,SECTION IV.,"task of governing the people. And, agreeably to the desire of my father,"
6385,SECTION IV.,to morrow will take place my installation. To-night Sitā will fast along
6386,SECTION IV.,with me. The priests have said thus; and this also hath been declared by
6387,SECTION IV.,my father. Do thou therefore even to-day provide those necessary
6388,SECTION IV.,auspicious things that will be required for myself and Vaidehi on the
6389,SECTION IV.,"occasion of the coming installation."""
6390,SECTION IV.,
6391,SECTION IV.,"Hearing of that for which she had ever wished, Kauçalyā, her voice"
6392,SECTION IV.,"choking with the vapour begot of delight, addressed Rāma, saying,—""Rāma,"
6393,SECTION IV.,"my child, be thou long lived; and may thy enemies find destruction!"
6394,SECTION IV.,"Furnished with this good fortune, do thou gladden Sumitrā’s as well as"
6395,SECTION IV.,my own relatives. Oh! thou wast born under an auspicious star: thou
6396,SECTION IV.,"hast. O son, by thy virtues gratified thy sire Daçarātha. Ah! not"
6397,SECTION IV.,unfruitful has proved my disinterested observance of vow unto the
6398,SECTION IV.,lotus-eyed Person; for this royal fortune of the Ikshwāku race shall
6399,SECTION IV.,"rest upon thee."""
6400,SECTION IV.,
6401,SECTION IV.,"Having been thus addressed by his mother, Rāma looking at his brother"
6402,SECTION IV.,"(Lakshmana), seated in humble guise with clasped hands, with smile spake"
6403,SECTION IV.,"unto him, saying,—""O Lakshmana, do thou together with me rule this"
6404,SECTION IV.,earth. Thou art my second self; and this good fortune hath taken
6405,SECTION IV.,"possession of thee (as well). Do thou, O Sumitrā’s son, enjoy every"
6406,SECTION IV.,desirable thing and the privileges pertaining to royalty. My life and
6407,SECTION IV.,this kingdom I covet for thy sake alone.” Having said this unto

6425,SECTION V.,"versed in the Veda, the worshipful Vasistha conversant wdth _mantras_,"
6426,SECTION V.,"that one practicing excellent vows, mounting a Brāhma car, himself went"
6427,SECTION V.,"unto the residence of Rāma cognizant of _mantras_, for the purpose of"
6428,SECTION V.,"making him fast. And that foremost of ascetics, having readied Rāma’s"
6429,SECTION V.,"sable hued residence resembling a mass of clouds, passed through three"
6430,SECTION V.,"several apartments, mounted on the car. With the view of honoring the"
6431,SECTION V.,"saint worthy of honor, Rāma swiftly issued out of his abode. And nearing"
6432,SECTION V.,"the car of that intelligent one, Rāma, personally taking him by the"
6433,SECTION V.,"hand, made him descend. Finding Rāma so humble and dear, the priest"
6434,SECTION V.,"addressed him, gratifying and delighting him with words that were"
6435,SECTION V.,"acceptable,—“O Rāma thy father hath been well pleased with thee; since"
6436,SECTION V.,thou achievest the kingdom (through him). Do thou to-day fast with Sitā.
6437,SECTION V.,"And in the morning, the king, thy father Daçarātha, will, well-pleased"
6438,SECTION V.,"install thee as heir-apparent like Nahusha installing Yayāti."" Having"
6439,SECTION V.,"said this, that pure spirited one, observing vows with _mantras_, made"
6440,SECTION V.,"Rāma fast along with Sitā. Then having been duly worshipped by Rāma, and"
6441,SECTION V.,"taken Kākutstha’s permission, the spiritual preceptor of the king, went"
6442,SECTION V.,"away from Rāma’s residence. Rāma, having passed sometime with"
6443,SECTION V.,"sweet-speeched friends, and been honored by them, with their permission"
6444,SECTION V.,entered his apartment. At that time Rāma’s residence was filled with
6445,SECTION V.,joyous men and women; and it was like unto a lake containing lotuses and
6446,SECTION V.,graced with maddened birds.
6447,SECTION V.,
6448,SECTION V.,"(On the other hand) Vasishtha, issuing from the palace of Rāma like unto"
6449,SECTION V.,"the king’s palace itself, found the street filled with people. On all"
6450,SECTION V.,"sides, Ayodhyā’s high-ways were crowded with groups of men full of"
6451,SECTION V.,curiosity. The tumult that arose in the high-ways in consequence of the
6452,SECTION V.,"concourse and noise, was like the roaring of the ocean. The streets were"
6453,SECTION V.,cleared and washed and hung with garlands; and that day Ayodhyā had her
6454,SECTION V.,dwellings furnished with upraised flagstaffs. In the city of Ayodhyā men
6455,SECTION V.,with women and children eagerly expected the rising of the sun (next
6456,SECTION V.,"day), and Rāma’s installation; and the people burnt to behold in Ayodhyā"
6457,SECTION V.,"the august festivity, that was like unto an ornament unto the subjects,"
6458,SECTION V.,and that enhanced the joy of the people. Dividing the crowd thronging
6459,SECTION V.,"the high-way, the priest slowly proceeded to the royal family. And"
6460,SECTION V.,"ascending the palace like unto a peak of the Himavat, he met with the"
6461,SECTION V.,"lord of men, like Vrihaspati meeting with Sakra. Seeing him come, the"
6462,SECTION V.,"king rising up from his royal seat, asked Vasishtha whether his"
6463,SECTION V.,"intention had been carried out, whereupon Vasishtha answered that it"
6464,SECTION V.,"had. The courtiers who had all along sat with Daçarātha, rose from the"
6465,SECTION V.,"seats, for worshipping the priest. Then with the permission of his"
6466,SECTION V.,"spiritual guide, leaving that assembly of men, the monarch entered his"
6467,SECTION V.,inner apartment like a lion entering his den. Even as the moon
6468,SECTION V.,"illumineth the firmament crowded with stars, the handsome king entered"
6469,SECTION V.,"his mansion, like unto the abode of the mighty Indra, and thronged with"
6470,SECTION V.,"females excellently attired,—gracing it (by his presence)."

6479,SECTION VI.,eyes. Then raising the vessel of clarified butter unto his head (by way
6480,SECTION VI.,"of paying reverence), he in accordance with the ordinance began to offer"
6481,SECTION VI.,"oblations unto the flaming fire on behalf of that mighty deity. Then,"
6482,SECTION VI.,"having partaken of the remaining quantity of the clarified butter, Rāma"
6483,SECTION VI.,"prayed for his own welfare, and meditated on the god Nārāyana. The son"
6484,SECTION VI.,"of the best of men with a collected mind, and restraining his speech lay"
6485,SECTION VI.,down on a _kuça_ bed together with Vaidehi within the graceful dwelling
6486,SECTION VI.,of Vishnu.
6487,SECTION VI.,
6488,SECTION VI.,"When a single watch only remained of the night, Rāma awoke, and made his"

6491,SECTION VI.,"finished devotions for the prior twilight, and with an intent mind began"
6492,SECTION VI.,"to recite (_Sāvatri_)¹¹³ And clad in a clear silk dress, he with bended"
6493,SECTION VI.,"head hymned the destroyer of Madhu, and made the regenerate ones perform"
6494,SECTION VI.,the _Swastivāchana_ ceremony. Already resounding with the blares of
6495,SECTION VI.,"trumpets, Ayodhyā became filled with the sweet and solemn tones of the"
6496,SECTION VI.,"expression ""Holy day"" uttered by them. The denizens of Ayodhyā, hearing"
6497,SECTION VI.,"that Rāghava had fasted with Vaidehi, rejoiced exceedingly."
6498,SECTION VI.,
6499,SECTION VI.,"Then the citizens, hearing of the installation of Rāma, and seeing that"
6500,SECTION VI.,"the night had departed, fell to adorning the city. Standards with"
6501,SECTION VI.,pennons were beautifully reared up in the abodes of the gods resembling
6502,SECTION VI.,"a peak, enveloped with white clouds, and at the crossing, and on"
6503,SECTION VI.,high-ways; and over the chaitya tree; and edifices; and over the
6504,SECTION VI.,warehouses of merchants abounding in goods and the goodly and prosperous
6505,SECTION VI.,mansions of householders; and over all the council-houses; and
6506,SECTION VI.,"conspicuous trees. The multitude then heard the music, soothing unto the"
6507,SECTION VI.,"ear and heart, of stage managers, dancers and singers chanting. The"
6508,SECTION VI.,people began to talk with each other anent the installation of Rāma; and
6509,SECTION VI.,"the time for his installation having arrived, on terraces and houses,"
6510,SECTION VI.,"and doorways boys playing in bodies, conversed with each other"
6511,SECTION VI.,concerning the installation of Rāma. On the occasion of the investiture
6512,SECTION VI.,"of Rāma, the goodly high-ways were adorned with garlands,and scented"
6513,SECTION VI.,with _dhupa_ incense—by the citizens. And fearing lest Rāma should come
6514,SECTION VI.,"out over night (to behold the beautified capital), the inhabitants of"
6515,SECTION VI.,"the city, by way of ornamentation as with the view of beholding Rāma"
6516,SECTION VI.,"himself, had by the road side reared up lamp-stands in the form of"
6517,SECTION VI.,(branched) trees. Eagerly expecting the investiture of Rāma as the heir
6518,SECTION VI.,"apparent, all having thus ornamented the city and assembling themselves"
6519,SECTION VI.,"on terraces and in council-halls, talking with each other, extolled the"
6520,SECTION VI.,"lord of men, saying,—""Ah high-souled is this king—the perpetuator of the"
6521,SECTION VI.,"Ikshwāku race; for, knowing himself as old, he will install Rāma in the"
6522,SECTION VI.,"kingdom. Obliged we have been, since good Rāma capable of reading"
6523,SECTION VI.,"character, will be the lord of earth, and our protector. He is of a"
6524,SECTION VI.,"heart devoid of arrogance, and is learned; and righteous-souled; and"
6525,SECTION VI.,affectionate to his brothers. Rāghava loveth us even as he doth bis own
6526,SECTION VI.,brothers. May the sinless and pious king Daçarātha live long; for it is
6527,SECTION VI.,through his grace that we shall behold Rāma installed. The inhabitants
6528,SECTION VI.,"of the provinces, who having heard the tidings, had come from various"
6529,SECTION VI.,"regions, heard the citizens conversing thus. Desirous of beholding the"
6530,SECTION VI.,"installation of Rāma, they coming into the city from various directions,"
6531,SECTION VI.,"filled Rāma’s city. As the vast concourse entered (the city), there was"
6532,SECTION VI.,heard an uproar like unto the roaring of the heaving ocean during the
6533,SECTION VI.,"fullness of the moon. Then that city resembling the regions of Indra,"
6534,SECTION VI.,being filled on all sides with tumult raised by the dwellers of the

6550,SECTION VII.,with standards bearing gay pennons; with thoroughfares and roads leading

6554,SECTION VII.,having the doorways of the temples painted white; and resounding with

6564,SECTION VII.,"overflow of joy? And what doth the delighted monarch purpose to do?"""
6565,SECTION VII.,"Thereupon bursting with very great delight, the nurse communicated unto"
6566,SECTION VII.,"the hump-backed woman the high fortune awaiting Rāma, saying,—""To-morrow"
6567,SECTION VII.,"under Pushyā, king Daçarātha will install the sinless Rāghava having his"
6568,SECTION VII.,"anger under control, as heir-apparent to the throne."" Hearing the words"
6569,SECTION VII.,"of the nurse, the hump-backed one, speedily growing angry, descended"
6570,SECTION VII.,from the edifice resembling a summit of the Kailāça hill. Burning in
6571,SECTION VII.,"ire, the sin-seeking Mantharā addressed Kaikeyi, lying down,"
6572,SECTION VII.,"saying,—""Up, ye senseless one! What for art thou down? A great danger"
6573,SECTION VII.,approacheth thee. Thou understandeth not that a mighty grief overfloweth
6574,SECTION VII.,thee. Thou boastest of good fortune while misfortune is thine in the
6575,SECTION VII.,shape of luck. Thy good fortune is surely unstable like the tide of a
6576,SECTION VII.,river during summer. Thus addressed by the sin-seeking hump-backed (hag)
6577,SECTION VII.,"in exceedingly harsh language, Kaikeyi became afflicted with great"
6578,SECTION VII.,"grief. And Kaikeyi said unto the hump-backed one,—""Is any evil present,"
6579,SECTION VII.,O Mantharā? I do not find thee with countenance fallen and sore
6580,SECTION VII.,"distressed with grief."" The hump-backed Mantharā, skilled in speech, who"

6582,SECTION VII.,"words, displaying sorrow greater than Kaikeyi’s own, lamenting, and"
6583,SECTION VII.,"enlisting Kaikeyi’s feelings against Rāma, uttered words inflamed with"
6584,SECTION VII.,"anger, saying,—""O worshipful one, an enduring and terrible destruction"
6585,SECTION VII.,is imminent unto thee. King Daçarātha will install Rāma as
6586,SECTION VII.,heir-apparent. I have been sunk in a fathomless fear; and am afflicted

6738,SECTION IX.,"thou tell me the means. By what means, O Mantharā, Bharata will gain the"
6739,SECTION IX.,"kingdom, and in no wise Rāma."" Thus addressed by the worshipful one, the"
6740,SECTION IX.,"wicked- minded Mantharā,—envying Rāma’s interest, thus spoke unto"
6741,SECTION IX.,"Kaikeyi:—""Formerly during the wars of the gods and Asuras, thy husband"
6742,SECTION IX.,"taking thee along, went with the royal saints for the purpose of"
6743,SECTION IX.,"assisting the king of the celestials. O Kaikeyi, in Dandaka, situated"
6744,SECTION IX.,"towards the south, there is the city known by the name of Vaijayanta,"
6745,SECTION IX.,"where dwelt Timidhvaja, otherwise called Samvara, —possessed of an"
6746,SECTION IX.,"hundred conjurations, and a mighty Asura. That unreproved one gave"
6747,SECTION IX.,battle unto Sakra accompanied by the celestials. And in that mighty
6748,SECTION IX.,conflict the Rākshasas during the night used to drag by main force
6749,SECTION IX.,"persons asleep having their bodies cut all over, and kill them. Then"
6750,SECTION IX.,King Daçarātha warred with the Asuras most heroically. And that mighty
6751,SECTION IX.,"armed one, O worshipful lady, losing his senses in consequence of wounds"
6752,SECTION IX.,"received from weapons, was removed from the field by thee. In that"
6753,SECTION IX.,"imminent danger, thy husband, sadly cut by weapons, was preserved by"
6754,SECTION IX.,"thee. Thereupon gratified, he, O, thou of gracious presence, granted"
6755,SECTION IX.,"thee two boons. Whereupon thou didst say,—’I shall receive from my lord"
6756,SECTION IX.,the boon whenever I shall wish.’ Thereupon that high-souled one
6757,SECTION IX.,"said,—’So be it.’ I did not know anything about this, O respected one;"
6758,SECTION IX.,and it was thou who didst formerly communicate this (unto me). And it is
6759,SECTION IX.,because I bear affection unto thee that I have not forgotten it. Now do
6760,SECTION IX.,thou forcibly make the monarch desist from installing Rāma; and ask thy
6761,SECTION IX.,"husband for these two boons,—the installation of Bharata, and the exile"
6762,SECTION IX.,of Rāma into the woods for fourteen years. On Rāma having been banished
6763,SECTION IX.,"into the woods for fourteen years, thy son securing the affections of"
6764,SECTION IX.,"subjects, will be firmly established (on the throne). Entering the"
6765,SECTION IX.,"anger-chamber to day, do thou, O daughter of Açwapati, clad in soiled"
6766,SECTION IX.,"garment, lie down on the uncovered floor. Do not look at him, nor speak"
6767,SECTION IX.,"to him aught. Do thou on beholding the lord of the earth, over-whelmed"
6768,SECTION IX.,"with grief, weep only. Thou hast always been the favorite wife of thy"
6769,SECTION IX.,husband. Of this I have not the least doubt. For thy sake the monarch
6770,SECTION IX.,"can enter into a flame. He can never anger thee, nor can he eye thee"
6771,SECTION IX.,when angered. For compassing thy pleasure the king can renounce life
6772,SECTION IX.,itself. Therefore the monarch can never set aside thy word. O senseless
6773,SECTION IX.,"lady, do thou now reflect upon the strength of thy good fortune. King"
6774,SECTION IX.,Daçaratba will offer thee rubies and pearls and gold and gems of various
6775,SECTION IX.,"kinds; but do not thou bend thy heart to them. Do thou, exalted dame,"
6776,SECTION IX.,bring into Daçarātha’s recollection the two boons which he had granted
6777,SECTION IX.,"thee at the time of the war between the gods and Asuras, and thou shalt"
6778,SECTION IX.,"not fail to achieve thy objects. And when that descendant of Raghu,"
6779,SECTION IX.,"raising thee will go to bestow the boons, do thou then binding him fast"
6780,SECTION IX.,"by oath, unfold unto the monarch the boons,saying,— ’Send Rāma unto the"
6781,SECTION IX.,"forest for nine and five years, and let Bharata, becoming on earth the"
6782,SECTION IX.,"foremost of monarchs, carry on the Government.’ And Rāma having been"
6783,SECTION IX.,"banished for fourteen years, thy son growing (in the interval) firm and"
6784,SECTION IX.,"fast, will remain (on the throne) during the rest of his life. Do thou,"
6785,SECTION IX.,"therefore, O worshipful one, demand even the banishment of Rāma; for by"
6786,SECTION IX.,"this it is, O damsel, all interests will be secured unto thy son. Thus"
6787,SECTION IX.,banished Rāma will no longer maintain possession of the hearts of the
6788,SECTION IX.,"people; and thy Bharata with his foes put out, will be the king. By the"
6789,SECTION IX.,"time that Rāma returns from the forest, thy son, thy prudent son along"
6790,SECTION IX.,"with his friends, securing the hearts of the people externally and"
6791,SECTION IX.,"internally, will have been firmly established on the throne. Now is the"
6792,SECTION IX.,"time, I apprehend. Renouncing fear, do thou forcibly make the monarch"
6793,SECTION IX.,"remove from his mind his intention of installing Rāma."""
6794,SECTION IX.,
6795,SECTION IX.,"Having been thus made to accept that for good which was really evil,"
6796,SECTION IX.,"Kaikeyi, desirous of obtaining the boons, was filled with delight. And"
6797,SECTION IX.,"at the words of the hump-backed woman, that exceedingly beautiful"
6798,SECTION IX.,"Kaikeyi experienced the height of pride, and betook herself to this"
6799,SECTION IX.,"wrong course, like a mare attached to her young, (springing up after"
6800,SECTION IX.,"it). And she said to Mantharā,—""O excellent wench, O speaker of things"
6801,SECTION IX.,"fair, thy wisdom I do not dishonor. In ascertaining the propriety or"
6802,SECTION IX.,"otherwise of actions, thou art the very first of hump- backed women on"
6803,SECTION IX.,"earth. And ever intent on my interest, thou seekest my welfare. I had"
6804,SECTION IX.,"not, O hump-backed one, (ere this) apprehended the endeavours of the"
6805,SECTION IX.,"king. O hump- backed one, there are many deformed, crooked and unsightly"
6806,SECTION IX.,"women (on earth); but thou alone down, lookest beautiful like a lotus"
6807,SECTION IX.,"bent by the breeze. Thy breast weighed down by thy hump, is high near"
6808,SECTION IX.,"the shoulders; and beneath is thy belly graced with a goodly navel,"
6809,SECTION IX.,which hath grown lean from shame (on holding the attitude of thy bust.)
6810,SECTION IX.,Thy buttocks are spacious; and thy breasts are firm. Thy countenance is
6811,SECTION IX.,"like the bright moon, Ah! O Mantharā,how lovely dost thou look! Thy hips"
6812,SECTION IX.,"are smooth, and is decked with chains; and thy thighs and legs are of"
6813,SECTION IX.,"large proportions. O Mantharā, O thou clad in linen garment, O graceful"
6814,SECTION IX.,"damsel, with thy pair of spacious humps, thou goest before me like a"
6815,SECTION IX.,she- crane. In thy heart reside all those thousand-conjurations
6816,SECTION IX.,"belonging to that lord of the Asuras, Samvara; and besides thousands"
6817,SECTION IX.,there are many more. Intelligence and policy and conjurations reside in
6818,SECTION IX.,thy elevated hump resembling the nave of a chariot- wheel. When Bharata
6819,SECTION IX.,"hath been installed and Rāma gone to the woods, I will, O hump-backed"
6820,SECTION IX.,"one, furnish thy hump with a garland made, O beautiful one, of well"
6821,SECTION IX.,"melted gold. And when I shall have attained my object and be happy, I"
6822,SECTION IX.,"will smear thy hump with sandal paste. O hump-backed one, I will prepare"
6823,SECTION IX.,for thy face an excellent _tilaka_ of gold; as well as other ornaments.
6824,SECTION IX.,"Wearing elegant apparel, thou wilt go about like a very goddess. With an"
6825,SECTION IX.,"incomparable countenance challenging the moon himself, thou wilt attain"
6826,SECTION IX.,"pre-eminence, defying thy foes. Even as thou servest me, other"
6827,SECTION IX.,"hump-backed women adorned with every ornament will serve thy feet."""
6828,SECTION IX.,
6829,SECTION IX.,"Thus praised by Kaikeyi, as she was lying down on a white bed, like unto"
6830,SECTION IX.,"fire upon the sacrificial dais, Mantharā addressed her, saying,—""O"
6831,SECTION IX.,"blessed one, when water has flown out, it is not proper to set up a"
6832,SECTION IX.,"dyke. Arise. Do thy welfare. Show thyself unto the king."" Puffed up with"
6833,SECTION IX.,"the pride of good fortune, that noble lady of expansive eyes thus"
6834,SECTION IX.,"encouraged (by Mantharā), went with her to the anger- chamber. (Having"
6835,SECTION IX.,"entered the chamber), that exalted lady put off her pearl neck-lace"
6836,SECTION IX.,"priced at many hundreds and thousands of gold, together with other"
6837,SECTION IX.,"elegant, beautiful and rich ornaments. Then sitting down upon the"
6838,SECTION IX.,"ground, Kaikeyi, comparable unto gold, under the influence of Mantharā’s"
6839,SECTION IX.,"words, spoke unto her, saying—""Do thou, hump-backed one, tell the"
6840,SECTION IX.,"monarch, that I am dead at this place. On Rāghava having gone to the"
6841,SECTION IX.,"forest, Bharata will obtain the earth. I do not require gold, or gems,"
6842,SECTION IX.,"or repasts; this will be the end of my existence if Rāma be installed."""
6843,SECTION IX.,
6844,SECTION IX.,Again the hump-backed woman addressed Bharata’s mother in exceedingly
6845,SECTION IX.,"cruel language fraught with good unto Bharata and evil unto Rāma,—""If"
6846,SECTION IX.,"Rāghava attaineth the kingdom, thou wilt surely grieve along with thy"
6847,SECTION IX.,"son. Therefore, O blessed one, do thou strive so that thy son Bharata be"
6848,SECTION IX.,"installed."""
6849,SECTION IX.,
6850,SECTION IX.,"Thus momentarily pierced by the wordy shafts shot by Mantharā, the queen"
6851,SECTION IX.,"exceedingly surprised, laying her hand on her bosom, wrathfully broke"
6852,SECTION IX.,"out,—""Either beholding me gone unto the regions of Death, thou wilt"
6853,SECTION IX.,"apprize the king of it, or Rāghava repairing unto the forest for a long"
6854,SECTION IX.,"time, Bharata will attain his desire. If Rāghava doth not repair hence"
6855,SECTION IX.,"into the forest, I will not desire beds, nor garlands, nor sandal paste,"
6856,SECTION IX.,"nor colyrium, nor meat, nor drinks, nor life."" Having said these cruel"
6857,SECTION IX.,"words, and thrown off every ornament, the wrathful dame lay down on the"
6858,SECTION IX.,"ground having no covering, like a fallen Kinnari. Casting away her"
6859,SECTION IX.,excellent garlands and ornaments with her countenance clouded with the
6860,SECTION IX.,"gloom of wrath, the King’s wife became sunk in thought looking like a"
6861,SECTION IX.,"sky enveloped in darkness, with the stars hid."

6868,SECTION X.,"Thus perversely advised by the exceedingly wicked Mantharā, the noble"
6869,SECTION X.,"and sagacious lady, influenced by passion, having completely decided in"
6870,SECTION X.,"her mind as to her course, was lying down on the ground like a Kinnari"
6871,SECTION X.,"pierced with poisoned shafts, and gradually told everything unto"
6872,SECTION X.,"Mantharā. And having made up her mind, that lady wrought up with ire,"
6873,SECTION X.,"being under the influence of Mantharā’s words, sighed hot and hard like"
6874,SECTION X.,the daughter of a Naga; and for a while reflected on the way which was
6875,SECTION X.,"to bring her happiness.Then her friend and well-wisher Mantharā, hearing"
6876,SECTION X.,"of her resolution, rejoiced exceedingly, as if she had already secured"
6877,SECTION X.,"success. And, having fully ascertained her course, that weak one being"
6878,SECTION X.,"angry, lay down upon the floor, knitting her eyebrows. The ground was"
6879,SECTION X.,strewn with garlands and excellent ornaments which Kaikeyi had cast
6880,SECTION X.,away; and they adorned the earth as the stars adorn the welkin. Like an
6881,SECTION X.,"enfeebled Kinnari she clad in a soiled garment, binding fast her braid,"
6882,SECTION X.,lay down in the anger-chamber.
6883,SECTION X.,
6884,SECTION X.,"The monarch having issued orders for the installation of Rāma,entered"
6885,SECTION X.,his inner apartment after giving permission to the courtiers to repair
6886,SECTION X.,"to their respective abodes. ""To-day it has been fixed to install Rāma,"
6887,SECTION X.,"but Kaikeyi has not yet heard of it""—thus thought the monarch. Therefore"
6888,SECTION X.,with the view of communicating the welcome news unto that lady deserving
6889,SECTION X.,"of good, (Kaikeyi), that renowned one of subdued senses entered the"
6890,SECTION X.,inner apartment. Like unto the moon entering the sky covered with white
6891,SECTION X.,"clouds and with Rāhu present in it, that one of high fame entered the"
6892,SECTION X.,"excellent apartment of Kaikeyi, having parrots and peacocks and"
6893,SECTION X.,"_Kraunchas_ and swans, resounding with the sounds of musical"
6894,SECTION X.,"instruments,—containing hump-backed and dwarfish women, graced with"
6895,SECTION X.,"houses containing creepers, and pictures, and adorned with _ashokas_ and"
6896,SECTION X.,"_champakas_, furnished with daises composed of ivory and silver and"
6897,SECTION X.,"gold, and adorned with trees bearing flowers and fruits always, and"
6898,SECTION X.,"tanks, having superb seats made of ivory, silver and gold; rich with"
6899,SECTION X.,"various viands and drinks and edibles, with costly ornaments, and"
6900,SECTION X.,resembling heaven itself; and the prosperous monarch having entered his
6901,SECTION X.,own inner apartment did not see his dear Kaikeyi on the excellent bed.
6902,SECTION X.,"The lord of men not seeing his favorite wife, asked (within himself) and"
6903,SECTION X.,was struck with grief. Never before this that noble lady spent that hour
6904,SECTION X.,(at any other place); nor had the monarch ever entered the empty
6905,SECTION X.,apartment. Then the king entering the apartment asked (a sentinel)
6906,SECTION X.,"concerning Kaikeyi, not knowing that that unwise woman was hankering"
6907,SECTION X.,"after her self-interest, as on previous occasions not finding her he"
6908,SECTION X.,"used to ask. Thereupon hurriedly and with clasped hands, the warder"
6909,SECTION X.,"said,— ""Worshipful sire, the noble lady exceedingly angry, hath repaired"
6910,SECTION X.,"unto the anger chamber."" Hearing the warder’s word, the king exceedingly"
6911,SECTION X.,"anxious, with his senses agitated and afflicted, again grieved. There"
6912,SECTION X.,"burning with grief, the lord of the earth saw her lying down on the"
6913,SECTION X.,ground in an improper guise. And the sinless aged (monarch) saw on the
6914,SECTION X.,"ground his youthful wife dearer unto him than life itself, cherishing an"
6915,SECTION X.,"unrighteous intention,—like a torn creeper, and lying down like a very"
6916,SECTION X.,"goddess, resembling a Kinnari fallen from heaven because of sin, like a"
6917,SECTION X.,"fallen Apsarā, like unto an illusion spread to take another, and like an"
6918,SECTION X.,"ensnared doe, or a she-clcphant that has been pierced with an envenomed"

6920,SECTION X.,"midst of a forest, the king, exceedingly aggrieved, out of affection,"
6921,SECTION X.,"gently passing his hand upon Kaikeyi’s person, thus addressed her"
6922,SECTION X.,"furnished with eyes resembling lotus’ petals,—""I do not know why thou"

6924,SECTION X.,"has offended thee, that, O auspicious one, in this guise thou art lying"
6925,SECTION X.,down in dust enhancing my sorrow? And wherefore art thou down on the
6926,SECTION X.,"ground, I, who seek thy welfare, being yet alive? O thou that afflictest"
6927,SECTION X.,"my heart, art like one under the influence of a malignant spirit, I have"
6928,SECTION X.,"skilful physicians whom I have completely satisfied with gifts,—they"
6929,SECTION X.,"will render thee whole. Do thou, O angry wench, mention thy malady. Whom"
6930,SECTION X.,dost thou wish to please; and whom to displease? Who shall to-day
6931,SECTION X.,"receive an welcome office, and who a highly unwelcome one? Do not"
6932,SECTION X.,"conceal thy thoughts, nor, O noble one, afflict thy person. Who, that"
6933,SECTION X.,"should not be slain, shall be put to death; and who that should, is to"
6934,SECTION X.,be set at liberty? Who that is poor is to be made rich; and who that is
6935,SECTION X.,affluent is to be turned into a pauper? I and mine are at thy command. I
6936,SECTION X.,"dare not cross any wish of thine. Tell me thy mind, and I will satisfy"
6937,SECTION X.,thee by laying down life itself. Thou knowest the influence thou hast
6938,SECTION X.,"upon me,—therefore, it behoveth thee not to entertain any apprehension."
6939,SECTION X.,By all my good deeds I swear that I will compass thy pleasure. The space

6945,SECTION X.,"that thy mind may take a fancy to. What,0 timid one, is the use of"
6946,SECTION X.,"afflicting thyself thus? O beauteous damsel, arise, arise. Do thou, O"
6947,SECTION X.,"Kaikeyi, unfold unto me the cause whence hath proceeded thy fear. On"

7047,SECTION XII.,"regard for Rāma’s virtues, for what transgression shall I forsake my"
7048,SECTION XII.,"dear son? I may renounce Kauçalyā or Sumitrā or the kingdom, or life"
7049,SECTION XII.,"itself; but Rāma, filled with affection for his father, will I not"
7050,SECTION XII.,renounce. I experience supreme delight on beholding my first-born; and
7051,SECTION XII.,"when I see him not, I lose my senses. The world may exist without the"
7052,SECTION XII.,Sun; and corn without water; but this life doth not exist in this body
7053,SECTION XII.,"without Rāma. Do thou then that entertainest unrighteous aims, abandon"
7054,SECTION XII.,this intention of thine. I lay my head at thy feet. Be propitious unto
7055,SECTION XII.,"me. Why dost thou, O sinful one, cherish in thy mind such a frightful"
7056,SECTION XII.,idea? Thou (often) asked me whether I love Bharata or not. Be that which
7057,SECTION XII.,thou hadst formerly told me in favor of that descendant of Raghu. ’That
7058,SECTION XII.,"blessed one is my eldest son, and the most righteous of them all’ even"
7059,SECTION XII.,"this, with the view of pleasing me, thou sweet speeched one had said."
7060,SECTION XII.,"Now hearing of the installation of Rāma, thou thyself filled with grief,"
7061,SECTION XII.,art making me exceedingly aggrieved. Or in this empty chamber having
7062,SECTION XII.,"been possessed, thou hast come under influence not thy own. And this"
7063,SECTION XII.,"signal lawlessness, O exalted lady, has befallen the race of the"
7064,SECTION XII.,"Ikshwākus; the cause of which, 0 Thou versed in moral laws, is thy"
7065,SECTION XII.,mental derangement. Thou didst not formerly do unto me aught that was
7066,SECTION XII.,"improper or disagreeable; therefore, O thou of expansive eyes, I cannot"
7067,SECTION XII.,"rely upon thee (as sane). Thou didst, O girl, many a time tell me that"
7068,SECTION XII.,"Rāma was equal unto thee with the high-souled Bharata. Wherefore then, O"
7069,SECTION XII.,"bashful one, dost thou like that the illustrious and righteous Rāma, O"
7070,SECTION XII.,"exalted dame, should reside in the forest for five and nine years? Why"
7071,SECTION XII.,dost thou like that the exceedingly tender Rāma with his soul
7072,SECTION XII.,"established in virtue, should dwell in the woods, undergoing terrible"
7073,SECTION XII.,"hardship? Why dost thou, O thou of graceful eyes, wish Rāma, captivating"
7074,SECTION XII.,"all creatures, and engaged in ministering unto thee, to be banished?"
7075,SECTION XII.,Rāma verily serveth thee far more than doth Bharata; and I do not find
7076,SECTION XII.,"that Bharata regardeth thee more than Rāma. Who will, save that foremost"
7077,SECTION XII.,"of men, so devotedly minister unto thee, regard thee, enhance thy"
7078,SECTION XII.,"influence, and do thy will. Not one of the many thousands of females and"
7079,SECTION XII.,"the innumerable retainers (in the palace), has been able to fasten"
7080,SECTION XII.,reproach upon Rāma for real or false misconduct. Soothing all creatures
7081,SECTION XII.,"with a pure heart, that great soul by means of good officers secureth"
7082,SECTION XII.,the affections of the inhabitants of the kingdom. He conquers all the
7083,SECTION XII.,twice-born ones by gifts; and that hero conquers his superiors by
7084,SECTION XII.,ministrations; and his enemies by encountering them with the bow. For
7085,SECTION XII.,"certain, in Rāghava are truth and charity, and asceticism,and self-"
7086,SECTION XII.,"renunciation,and friendship, and purity, and sincerity, and learning,"
7087,SECTION XII.,"and the disposition to tend his superiors. How, O respected one, canst"
7088,SECTION XII.,"thou ask for this that will bring thee sin, touching Rāma endowed with"
7089,SECTION XII.,"candour, and energetic like unto a Maharshi, and resembling a celestial?"
7090,SECTION XII.,"I do not recollect to have heard Rāma, who ever speaks sweet words, to"
7091,SECTION XII.,have used any unpleasant speech to any one; how can I then for thy sake
7092,SECTION XII.,unfold this disagreeable matter unto the beloved Rāma? And what stay
7093,SECTION XII.,"have I save him in whom abide forgtveness,and asceticism and"
7094,SECTION XII.,"renunciation, and verity, and righteousness, and gratitude, and harmless"
7095,SECTION XII.,"towards all creatures. It behoveth thee, O Kaikeyi, to have pity on me,"
7096,SECTION XII.,"aged and on the verge of death, and afflicted with grief, and"
7097,SECTION XII.,"distressed, and engaged in lamentations. Whatever can be obtained in"
7098,SECTION XII.,this earth bounded by the ocean I will confer on thee—do thou not bring
7099,SECTION XII.,"about my death. O Kaikeyi, 1 clasp my palms, I fall at thy feet, be thou"
7100,SECTION XII.,"the protector of Rāma, so that sin may not taint me."""
7101,SECTION XII.,
7102,SECTION XII.,When the terrible Kaikeyi in still more terrible language addressed the
7103,SECTION XII.,"mighty king, who was burning in grief, and bewailing, and deprived of"
7104,SECTION XII.,"his senses, and feeling a sensation of whirling, and overwhelmed with"
7105,SECTION XII.,"woe, and again and again beseeching for crossing this ocean of sorrow,"
7106,SECTION XII.,"saying. ""If, O monarch, having conferred the boon,thou repentest"
7107,SECTION XII.,"afterwards how, O hero, wilt thou speak of thy righteousness in the"
7108,SECTION XII.,"world? When,0 thou versed in duty, the Rajarshis assembled around thee,"
7109,SECTION XII.,"shall ask thee regarding this matter, what wilt thou answer? Wilt thou"
7110,SECTION XII.,"say, ’by whose favor do I live and who had tended me, unto that Kaikeyi"
7111,SECTION XII.,"have I broken my promise?’ Surely, O lord of men, thou wilt bring"
7112,SECTION XII.,"disgrace unto all the monarchs (of thy line), since having conferred the"
7113,SECTION XII.,"boons this very day, thou speakest otherwise. Saivya granted his own"
7114,SECTION XII.,flesh unto the bird in the matter of the hawk and the pigeon.¹¹⁵ And
7115,SECTION XII.,"Alarka, having granted his eyes (unto a blind Brahmin) attained"
7116,SECTION XII.,"excellent state. And the ocean, having bound himself by promise, never"
7117,SECTION XII.,passes beyond his shores. Remembering these old stories render not thy
7118,SECTION XII.,"promise nugatory. O thou of perverted understanding, renouncing"
7119,SECTION XII.,"righteousness, and installing Rāma in the kingdom, thou wishest ever to"
7120,SECTION XII.,give thyself up to pleasure with Kauçalyā. Whether what I have proposed
7121,SECTION XII.,"be righteous or otherwise, whether thou hast promised truly or falsely,"
7122,SECTION XII.,"swerve not from thy word. If thou install Raima, this very day drinking"
7123,SECTION XII.,"poison, I will surely die before thee. If I for a single day behold"
7124,SECTION XII.,"Rāma’s mother receiving homage rendered with clasped hands, I will"
7125,SECTION XII.,"consider death even as welcome, O lord of men, by Bharata’s self dear"
7126,SECTION XII.,"unto me as my own life, I swear that save the exile of Rāma, nothing"
7127,SECTION XII.,"shall satisfy me."""
7128,SECTION XII.,
7129,SECTION XII.,"Having said this, Kaikeyi paused; and maintained silence disregarding"
7130,SECTION XII.,"the bewailing monarch. The king with his senses overwhelmed with grief,"
7131,SECTION XII.,"hearing Kaikeyi’s exceedingly bitter words, reflected on Rāma’s abode in"
7132,SECTION XII.,"the woods, and the advancement of Bharata, and being bewildered for a"
7133,SECTION XII.,while spoke not unto Kaikeyi; but gazed steadfastly at that exalted
7134,SECTION XII.,"dame, his beloved wife, who had uttered disagreeable things. And having"
7135,SECTION XII.,"heard that speech resembling a thunder-bolt, and unpleasant to the"
7136,SECTION XII.,"heart, and surcharged with grief, the king was extremely pained. Then"
7137,SECTION XII.,"recollecting that revered lady’s resolve, and his own terrible oath, he,"
7138,SECTION XII.,"sighing forth,—""O Rāma,"" dropped down like a felled tree. And then that"
7139,SECTION XII.,"master of the earth being deprived of his sense, was like a mad man, or"
7140,SECTION XII.,"a patient with his faculties wildered, or a serpent whose energy has"
7141,SECTION XII.,"been exhausted. In sad and distressful words, he addressed Kaikeyi,"
7142,SECTION XII.,"saying,—""Who is it that has convinced thee that this exceedingly heinous"
7143,SECTION XII.,"course is a proper one? Dost thou not feel shame to speak thus unto me,"
7144,SECTION XII.,like one whose faculties have been possessed by an evil spirit? I did
7145,SECTION XII.,"not know before, when thou wast youthful that thy nature was so"
7146,SECTION XII.,perverted; but now I find the very reverse of what I then thought.
7147,SECTION XII.,Whence proceedeth thy fear that thou askest for such a boon—the
7148,SECTION XII.,"establishment of Bharata in the kingdom, and the banishment of Rāma into"
7149,SECTION XII.,the woods? Do thou cease to urge such a suit that is fraught with evil
7150,SECTION XII.,"unto thy wifely virtue, and that will render my word untrue, if thou"
7151,SECTION XII.,"wishest for the good of thy husband, of the people, and Bharata. O cruel"
7152,SECTION XII.,"woman; O thou that intendest sinfully, O base wretch, O doer of impious"
7153,SECTION XII.,"deeds, how have I and Rāma conspired against thy happiness; and what"
7154,SECTION XII.,offence dost thou find in us? Bharata will by no means accept the
7155,SECTION XII.,"kingdom, depriving Rāma of it, for I consider Bharata a still more"
7156,SECTION XII.,"grounded in righteousness than Rāma himself. When I shall say,—""Repair"
7157,SECTION XII.,"unto the forest,"" and Rāma’s countenance will fall, like unto the moon"
7158,SECTION XII.,"overwhelmed by Rāhu, how shall I behold it? How shall I, having in"
7159,SECTION XII.,"consultation with my friends come to this decision, retract the same,"
7160,SECTION XII.,like unto an army defeated by the enemy? And what will the monarchs
7161,SECTION XII.,"coming from various quarters say concerning me,— ""Alas! how has this"
7162,SECTION XII.,puerile descendant of Ikshwāku reigned so long?’ And when many aged
7163,SECTION XII.,"folks, endowed with virtues, and accomplished in various lore will ask"
7164,SECTION XII.,"me concerning Kākutstha, what then shall I sav unto them.—’Sore pressed"
7165,SECTION XII.,"by Kaikeyi, have I banished Rāma? Even if I speak this truly, yet none"
7166,SECTION XII.,"will lend credence to it. And what will Kauçalyā say unto me, when Rāma"
7167,SECTION XII.,"shall have gone to the forest? Having dpne her this mighty wrong, what"
7168,SECTION XII.,"shall I say unto her? Kauçalyā serves me at the same time like a slave,"
7169,SECTION XII.,"and a friend, and wife, and sister, and mother. Ever studious of my"
7170,SECTION XII.,"welfare, dearly loving her son, and speaking every one fair, that"
7171,SECTION XII.,"exalted lady, although deserving of homage at my hands, has up to this"
7172,SECTION XII.,"time not been regarded by me, because of thee. That I have so long"
7173,SECTION XII.,"sought thy welfare, afflicteth me now, even like rice partaken by a sick"
7174,SECTION XII.,person with curries that are unhealthful. Beholding Rāma deprived of his
7175,SECTION XII.,"kingdom, and banished unto the forest, why will Sumitrā alarmed believe"
7176,SECTION XII.,"in me. Ah! woe to me! Vaidehi will have to hear of two evil events,—my"
7177,SECTION XII.,"death and Rāma’s journey unto the woods. Alas! my Vaidehi, indulging in"
7178,SECTION XII.,"grief, will renounce her existence, like a Kinnari on the side of the"
7179,SECTION XII.,"Himavat, who has been forsaken by her kinnara. When I shall witness Rāma"
7180,SECTION XII.,"repairing to the mighty forest, and Sitā weeping (in grief) , I shall"
7181,SECTION XII.,"not hope for a long life; and thou, becoming a widow, will reign along"
7182,SECTION XII.,"with thy son. Like unto a goodly liquor, which people having partaken"
7183,SECTION XII.,"it, subsequently find to contain poison, I have found thee, who had"
7184,SECTION XII.,"passed for a chaste woman, to be now really unchaste. Having soothed me"
7185,SECTION XII.,"with soft but false words, thou speakest thus. Thou hast killed me like"
7186,SECTION XII.,"a deer that has been entrapped by a hunter, having been allured into the"
7187,SECTION XII.,net through the sound of a song. Surely gentle folks will on the
7188,SECTION XII.,"high-way censure me as one lost to gentility,—as one who has sold his"
7189,SECTION XII.,"son (for buying his wife’s good graces), even like a Brāhmana given to"
7190,SECTION XII.,"drinking. Alas! alas! having promised thee the boon, I have to bear"
7191,SECTION XII.,these words of thine; and have come by this grief like unto evil
7192,SECTION XII.,"consequent upon misdeeds in a previous existence. Wretch as I am, like a"
7193,SECTION XII.,"halter set round one’s neck, have I, O vile woman, cherished thee"
7194,SECTION XII.,"through ignorance. Not knowing thee for my death, I have sported with"
7195,SECTION XII.,"thee, like an infant dallying in solitude with a venomous snake. Surely,"
7196,SECTION XII.,"people will be justified in con- demning me wicked-minded that I am, for"
7197,SECTION XII.,"my son having been deprived of his ancestral kingdom by me; saying,—"
7198,SECTION XII.,"""Alas! king Daçarātha is foolish and lustful; for he sends his beloved"
7199,SECTION XII.,"son to the woods for the sake of his wife."" Rāma has grown emaciated by"
7200,SECTION XII.,"study ng the Vedas, leading the Brahmācharyya mode of life, and serving"
7201,SECTION XII.,"his preceptors,—- will he again undergo this mighty toil at this time of"
7202,SECTION XII.,enjoyment? My son is incapable of uttering a second word unto me; and
7203,SECTION XII.,"commissioned, he will repair to the woods, saying, ’Very well.’ if"
7204,SECTION XII.,"ordered with ’Go to the forest,’ Rāghava does not consent, even that"
7205,SECTION XII.,would conduce to my pleasure; but he will do nothing of the kind. And
7206,SECTION XII.,"Rāghava having gone to the forest, Death will surely summon me away to"
7207,SECTION XII.,"his abode who am of exceedingly reprehensible character, and who am"
7208,SECTION XII.,"universally execrated. And I having been dead and that best of men,"
7209,SECTION XII.,"Rāma, having gone to the woods (I do not know) to what a plight thou"
7210,SECTION XII.,"wilt bring my kindreds. And if Kauçalyā loses me and Rāma, and Sumitrā"
7211,SECTION XII.,"loses her two sons and me and Rāma, then tormented with the extreme of"
7212,SECTION XII.,"grief, those exalted ladies will follow me. Do thou, O Kaikeyi, casting"
7213,SECTION XII.,"into hell Kauçalyā and Sumitrā and myself with our three sons, attain"
7214,SECTION XII.,"happiness. Renounced by me as well as Rāma, this lkshwaku line existing"
7215,SECTION XII.,"from a time immemorial, and ennobled by excellent qualities, and"
7216,SECTION XII.,"incapable of coming by grief, thou wilt rule, when it shall have been"
7217,SECTION XII.,"overwhelmed with misfortune. If the banishment of Rāma, be agreeable to"
7218,SECTION XII.,"Bharata let him not, when I am dead, perform my funeral obsequies. When"
7219,SECTION XII.,"I am dead, and when that foremost of men has gone to the forest, do"
7220,SECTION XII.,"thou, a widow, rule the kingdom along with thy son. O daughter of a"
7221,SECTION XII.,"king, when by chance thou residest in my mansion, I must come by signal"
7222,SECTION XII.,"infamy and discomfiture in the world, and meet with general disregard,"
7223,SECTION XII.,like unto a sinful person. How having always gone on cars and elephants
7224,SECTION XII.,"and horses, will dear Rāma range in the forest on foot? How will my son,"
7225,SECTION XII.,"at the approach of whose meal-time, cooks wearing ear-rings and"
7226,SECTION XII.,"emulating each other prepare excellent meats and drinks, pass his days,"
7227,SECTION XII.,"living on fare furnished by the woods, of astringent, or bitter, or"
7228,SECTION XII.,"pungent taste? How will he, who has always been clad in costly attire,"
7229,SECTION XII.,"and who has always enjoyed happiness, will dwell on the bare earth,"
7230,SECTION XII.,wearing a piece of red cloth? From whom hast thou received this
7231,SECTION XII.,"inconceivable and dreadful advice,— Rāma’s journey to the woods and"
7232,SECTION XII.,"installation of Bharata? Fie upon women, crafty and selfish! But I must"
7233,SECTION XII.,not name all women—I mean only the mother of Bharata. O thou that art
7234,SECTION XII.,"intent upon doing mischief unto all, O thou addicted to selfishness, O"
7235,SECTION XII.,"cruel one, has God made thy mind so very vile, only to torment me? What"
7236,SECTION XII.,"wrong hast thou come by either through me, or Rāma ever engaged in thy"
7237,SECTION XII.,"welfare? On beholding Rāma plunged in sorrow, fathers will forsake sons,"
7238,SECTION XII.,"and wives attached unto their husbands will forsake them, and the entire"
7239,SECTION XII.,"earth will be affected with ill-humour. When I hear him coming, adorned"
7240,SECTION XII.,"like unto a son of the celestials, I rejoice on casting my eyes on him,"
7241,SECTION XII.,"and I feel as if I had regained my youth. Men may do without the Sun,"
7242,SECTION XII.,"and the wielder of the thunder-bolt not raining, but none, I apprehend,"
7243,SECTION XII.,"can live, on witnessing Rāma repairing hence. I have kept in my mansion,"
7244,SECTION XII.,"like unto my own death, thee that desirest my destruction, and art"
7245,SECTION XII.,"intent upon doing me wrong, and art my foe. I have for a long time held"
7246,SECTION XII.,"thee on my lap, like unto a she-snake of virulent poison; therefore in"
7247,SECTION XII.,"consequence of my folly, I now meet with destruction. Now dissevered"
7248,SECTION XII.,"from me, and Rāma together with Lakshmana, let Bharata govern the city"
7249,SECTION XII.,"and the kingdom along with thee. Destroying thy relatives, do thou"
7250,SECTION XII.,"enhance the joy of my enemies. O thou cruelly-disposed, O thou bringer"
7251,SECTION XII.,"on of calamities, since banishing all sense of the relation in which we"
7252,SECTION XII.,"stand to each other as husband and wife, thou hast spoken thus, why"
7253,SECTION XII.,reduced to thousand fragments thy teeth drop not from off thy mouth down
7254,SECTION XII.,to the ground? Rāma has not used any harsh speech towards thee. Indeed
7255,SECTION XII.,Rāma knows no harsh speech; why then dost thou seek to inflict upon Rāma
7256,SECTION XII.,"(ever) pleasant spoken, and endowed with agreeable qualities—such"
7257,SECTION XII.,"wrongs. O thou that renderest infamous the king of the Kekayas, whether"
7258,SECTION XII.,"thou becomest miserable, or enterest into fire, or killest thyself (by"
7259,SECTION XII.,"taking poison), or divest into the bowels of the earth opened at a"
7260,SECTION XII.,"thousand places, I will not execute thy fell intention that is fraught"
7261,SECTION XII.,"with evil unto me. I do not wish, that thou, like unto a razor, and ever"
7262,SECTION XII.,"speaking pleasant falsehoods, and possessed of a vile heart, the"
7263,SECTION XII.,"destroyer of thy own race,—thou that wishest to burn my heart and life,"
7264,SECTION XII.,"thou unbeautiful one, mayst remain alive. My life itself is in"
7265,SECTION XII.,"jeopardy,—where then is my happiness? Where is the happiness of parents"
7266,SECTION XII.,"without their sons? It behoveth thee not, O noble dame, to do evil unto"
7267,SECTION XII.,"me. I take hold of thy feet; be thou propitious unto me."" As bewailing"
7268,SECTION XII.,thus like one forlorn the ruler of earth whose heart was captivated by
7269,SECTION XII.,Kaikeyi on account of her supreme beauty proceeded to take hold of her
7270,SECTION XII.,"feet, who having banished all self respect, sat with her legs stretched,"
7271,SECTION XII.,"he, without being able to come at them, fell down in a swoon, like one"
7272,SECTION XII.,enfeebled with disease.
7273,SECTION XII.,
7274,SECTION XII.,"¹¹⁵ The story goes that desirous of testing the charity of Saivya,"
7275,SECTION XII.,Indra and Agni assuming the forms of a hawk and a pigeon
7276,SECTION XII.,"respectively, went to the king, the former pursuing the latter."
7277,SECTION XII.,"The pigeon in a fright asked the protection of the monarch,"
7278,SECTION XII.,"whereon he granted it. But the hawk urged, ’why dost thou retain"

7288,SECTION XIII.,"guise, like Yayāti dropped from the celestial regions when his religious"
7289,SECTION XIII.,"merit had been exhausted, that lady, personating the ruin of the race,"
7290,SECTION XIII.,"not fearing public odium, who had discerned danger from Rāma unto"
7291,SECTION XIII.,"Bharata, not having attained her wish, again addressed the monarch,"
7292,SECTION XIII.,"concerning the boon he had promised unto her,—Thou describest thyself, O"
7293,SECTION XIII.,"mighty monarch, as speaking the truth and firm in vow. Why then dost"
7294,SECTION XIII.,"thou hesitate to confer this boon on me?"" Thus addressed by Kaikeyi king"
7295,SECTION XIII.,"Daçarātha, remaining stupified for a while thus answered her in"
7296,SECTION XIII.,"wrath,—""O ignoble one! O enemy of mine! On my being dead, and that chief"
7297,SECTION XIII.,"of men, Rāma, reparing to the woods, do thou, thine wish attained,"
7298,SECTION XIII.,"become happy. When in heaven, questioning me as to Rāma’s welfare, the"
7299,SECTION XIII.,"celestials, learning of his banishment to the woods, will tax me on this"
7300,SECTION XIII.,"score, how shall I also bear that reproach of theirs? If I shall"
7301,SECTION XIII.,truthfully say I have sent Rāma to the woods for compassing Kaikeyi’s
7302,SECTION XIII.,"pleasure, that will count for a falsehood. Sonless first, I have"
7303,SECTION XIII.,"obtained the exceedingly energetic and mighty Rāma by great pain,—how"
7304,SECTION XIII.,can I then renounce him? How shall I banish Rāma having eyes resembling
7305,SECTION XIII.,"lotus’ petals, who is heroic, and accomplished and of subdued anger, and"
7306,SECTION XIII.,forgiving. How shall I dismiss unto Dandaka the charming Rāma of dark
7307,SECTION XIII.,"blue hue like that of a blue lotus, possessed of mighty arms, and having"
7308,SECTION XIII.,"great strength? How shall I behold the intelligent Rāma in evil plight,"
7309,SECTION XIII.,"who has never known suffering, and has always enjoyed felicity? If"
7310,SECTION XIII.,"without inflicting injury upon Rāma, I meet with death, I shall then"
7311,SECTION XIII.,"attain happiness. O cruel Kaikeyi, O thou of evil purpose, why dost thou"
7312,SECTION XIII.,do this wrong unto my beloved Rāma having truth for prowess? If I banish
7313,SECTION XIII.,"Rāma, an unparalleled obloquy will surely darken (my fair fame)."
7314,SECTION XIII.,
7315,SECTION XIII.,"As king Daçarātha was bewailing thus with a heart wrought up with grief,"
7316,SECTION XIII.,"the sun set and night came on. But although crested with the lunar disc,"
7317,SECTION XIII.,"the night failed to bring comfort unto the king, distressed, and"
7318,SECTION XIII.,"indulging in grief. Then the old king Daçarātha, with his eyes fixed at"
7319,SECTION XIII.,"the sky, sighing hot, lamented in this strain—""O night studded with"
7320,SECTION XIII.,"stars, I beseech thee, let not the morning appear. Do thou, O gentle"

7323,SECTION XIII.,"hated and relentless Kaikeyi, who has brought this calamity upon me""."
7324,SECTION XIII.,"Having spoken thus, the king conversant with the duties of Sovereigns"
7325,SECTION XIII.,"again endeavoured to propitiate Kaikeyi, saying,—""O noble dame, do thou"
7326,SECTION XIII.,"show favour unto me, who am of honest ways, who am distressed, who have"
7327,SECTION XIII.,"made myself thine, who have finished his life, and who, in especial, am"
7328,SECTION XIII.,"thy king. That I have spoken to thee thus was because, O thou of shapely"

7330,SECTION XIII.,"show thy favour unto me,—be thou generous,—be thou propitious. Let my"

7332,SECTION XIII.,"having the outer corner of thy eyes of dark blue hue, thou wilt attain"
7333,SECTION XIII.,"high fame (among men). O thou of well-developed hips, do thou do this"

7336,SECTION XIII.,
7337,SECTION XIII.,"Having heard the exceedingly piteous words of her husband, the king of"

7340,SECTION XIII.,Thereat seeing that his favourite dissatisfied wife persisted in urging
7341,SECTION XIII.,"the banishment of his son, the king struck with grief, again fell down"
7342,SECTION XIII.,"to the earth, senseless. As the wise king afflicted with sorrow was"
7343,SECTION XIII.,"sighing hot and hard, the night passed away. Then as the eulogists"

7353,SECTION XIV.,"account of his son, and deprived of conciousness, and lying inert on the"
7354,SECTION XIV.,"ground, spoke unto him, saying,—""Having promised to grant me the boon,"
7355,SECTION XIV.,"how distressed dost thou lie on the ground, as if thou didst commit some"
7356,SECTION XIV.,sin? It behoveth thee to keep untainted thy dignity by performing what
7357,SECTION XIV.,"thou hast promised. Truth, say persons cognizant of it, is the prime"
7358,SECTION XIV.,"virtue. And it is in the interests of virtue, that I have been exhorting"
7359,SECTION XIV.,"thee. Having promised his own person unto the hawk, that lord of earth,"
7360,SECTION XIV.,"Saivya, having granted the same unto the bird, went the excellent way."
7361,SECTION XIV.,"In the same manner, Alarka, being asked, plucked out his eyes readily"
7362,SECTION XIV.,and bestowed them on a certain Brāhmana versed in the Vedas. And the
7363,SECTION XIV.,"lord of rivers, having promised, even on occasions of Parvas, does not"
7364,SECTION XIV.,pass over his bounds for the sake of truth. The one syllable (_Onkar_)
7365,SECTION XIV.,"signifying Brahmā. is the truth itself, In truth is established"

7367,SECTION XIV.,"attain the foremost state. If thy mind is established in virtue, do thou"
7368,SECTION XIV.,"then follow truth. Since, O excellent one, thou hast promised the boon,"
7369,SECTION XIV.,"let that boon bear fruit. Do thou, incited by me with the view of"
7370,SECTION XIV.,"maintaining virtue, banish Rāma. Thrice, do I tell thee. If thou dost"

7374,SECTION XIV.,"Thus fearlessly urged by Kaikeyi, the king could not take off from"

7378,SECTION XIV.,like unto a beast of burden moving tortuously when placed within the
7379,SECTION XIV.,"yoke and wheels. Then calming himself with a great effort, the king, as"
7380,SECTION XIV.,"if not seeing Kaikeyi, with his haggard eyes, addressed her, saying,—""I"
7381,SECTION XIV.,"do here, wicked wretch, renounce that hand of thine which I had held"
7382,SECTION XIV.,"with _mantras_ before the sacrificial fire, and I do also renounce along"
7383,SECTION XIV.,"with thee own-begotten¹¹⁶ thy son Bharata. O exalted one, the night has"

7392,SECTION XIV.,
7393,SECTION XIV.,"As the high-souled ruler of earth was speaking thus unto her, the night"

7398,SECTION XIV.,"It behoveth thee to summon hither thy son, the energetic Rāma. Having"
7399,SECTION XIV.,"established my son in the kingdom, and rendered Rāma a ranger of the"

7401,SECTION XIV.,"by Kaikeyi, the king like unto an excellent steed stung by a sharp goad,"

7422,SECTION XIV.,at the same time was his counseller of gracious looks. Therefore the
7423,SECTION XIV.,highly energetic Vasishtha said unto the skilful son of the
7424,SECTION XIV.,"charioteer,—""Do thou speedily acquaint the mighty monarch that I have"

7440,SECTION XIV.,"others, with hearts filled with joy, and mouth speaking pleasant words,"
7441,SECTION XIV.,stay with the sovereigns to witness the installation of Rāma. Do thou

7449,SECTION XIV.,could not prevent his entrance. Not knowing the plight that had befallen
7450,SECTION XIV.,"the king, Sumantra presenting himself before him, endeavoured to gladden"

7452,SECTION XIV.,"king, the charioteer Sumantra with clasped hands, pleasing the monarch"
7453,SECTION XIV.,"as he proceeded, said,—""Do thou please us delightedly and with a glad"

7455,SECTION XIV.,"The charioteer Matuli used to hymn India at this season, and (encouraged"

7465,SECTION XIV.,"with the Brāhmanas. Do thou, O king, immediately order the installation"

7469,SECTION XIV.,
7470,SECTION XIV.,"Hearing these words of Sumantra, bland and appropriate, the lord of"

7473,SECTION XIV.,"reddened with the effect of grief, seeing the charioteer, said,—""This"

7475,SECTION XIV.,
7476,SECTION XIV.,Hearing those sorrowful words and finding the lord of earth aggrieved

7478,SECTION XIV.,utterly incapable of speaking any thing personally owing to his heavy
7479,SECTION XIV.,"sorrow, Kaikeyi, the best counsellor in matters like these, addressed"
7480,SECTION XIV.,"Sumantra with the following words :—""Sumantra, being elated with joy on"
7481,SECTION XIV.,"account of Rāma’s installation, the king has kept up the whole night,"
7482,SECTION XIV.,"and being tired therefore, is overpowered with sleep. Go ye therefore"
7483,SECTION XIV.,"speedily, O charioteer, and bring Rāma here, the praiseworthy son of"

7490,SECTION XIV.,speedily delighted at the royal mandate. Being asked again by Kaikeyi to
7491,SECTION XIV.,hurry on at the time of departure Sumantra thought within himself—
7492,SECTION XIV.,"""Evident it is that the Queen has become impatient to sea Rāma’s"

7494,SECTION XIV.,"Thinking this the energetic charioteer with great delight, intent on"

7666,SECTION XVI.,"engaged in ceremonies, wearing excellent deer skin for cloth and"
7667,SECTION XVI.,"carrying horns in the hands. May Indra protect thee on the East, may"
7668,SECTION XVI.,"Yāma (Death) protect thee on the South, and Varuna (God of water) on the"
7669,SECTION XVI.,"West and Kuvera (God of wealth) on the North."" Being greeted with"
7670,SECTION XVI.,"benedictory ceremonies, Rāma, bidding farewell to Sitā, issued out of"
7671,SECTION XVI.,"his house like unto a lion, living in the den of a mountain. He saw"
7672,SECTION XVI.,"Lakshmana standing at the gate with clasped hands, and met all his"
7673,SECTION XVI.,friends assembled at the middle apartment. Then that great son of the
7674,SECTION XVI.,"king, casting a glance upon them all who were present there to see him"
7675,SECTION XVI.,"and pleasing them with sweet words ascended, like unto the thousand-eyed"
7676,SECTION XVI.,"Indra, the splendid chariot, made of silver and coated with tiger-skin,"
7677,SECTION XVI.,"and bright like the fire itself, making a noise (when going) like the"
7678,SECTION XVI.,"roaring of clouds; defying all obstacles, adorned with jewels, and gold,"
7679,SECTION XVI.,dazzling the eye-sight and bright like the golden peaks of Sumeru. It
7680,SECTION XVI.,"had two excellent horses tied to it like unto two young elephants, and"
7681,SECTION XVI.,"was of quick motion, resembling that of Indra’s chariot carried by his"
7682,SECTION XVI.,"horses. Ascending the car, Rāghava, of great effulgence, went speedily"
7683,SECTION XVI.,"on, making (the space)resounded like unto the muttering cloud on the"
7684,SECTION XVI.,sky. He issued out of his abode like the beautiful moon passing through
7685,SECTION XVI.,"a huge cloud. And Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rāghava, standing"
7686,SECTION XVI.,"behind him on the car with a splendid _Chowri_ in his hand, began to"
7687,SECTION XVI.,guard his body. And there was caused a great tumult by the crowd
7688,SECTION XVI.,gathering around on the issuing out of Rāma. Then followed in his train
7689,SECTION XVI.,many hundreds and thousands of beautiful horses and elephants resembling
7690,SECTION XVI.,"hills in their appearance; and went before him hundreds of heroes, well"
7691,SECTION XVI.,"accoutered, and having their bodies sprinkled with sandal and _Aguru_"
7692,SECTION XVI.,"and holding swords and arms in their hands, and other persons uttering"
7693,SECTION XVI.,"benedictions. He heard on the way sounds of musical instruments, eulogy"
7694,SECTION XVI.,of the panegyrists and lion-like roars of the heroes. Exquisitely
7695,SECTION XVI.,"beautiful damsels, adorned with various ornaments and dresses, standing"
7696,SECTION XVI.,by the windows began to shower flowers upon the head of the
7697,SECTION XVI.,"foe-destroyer Rāma, and those spotless beauties with a view to please"
7698,SECTION XVI.,"Rāma,some standing on the buildings and some on the ground began to"
7699,SECTION XVI.,"praise him:—""Oh thou, delight of thy mother, surely has mother Kauçalyā"
7700,SECTION XVI.,"become exceedingly gratified, on seeing thee of successful journey to"
7701,SECTION XVI.,"accept the heir- apparentship of the throne."" Those ladies thought that"
7702,SECTION XVI.,"Sitā, the captivater of Rāma’s heart was surely the best of all women"
7703,SECTION XVI.,and for certain had she performed some great austerities in her past
7704,SECTION XVI.,"life or else she would not have been the companion of Rāma, like unto"
7705,SECTION XVI.,"Rohini, the companion of Moon. That best among men heard these pleasant"
7706,SECTION XVI.,words from those ladies standing on the buildings and on high-ways.
7707,SECTION XVI.,Rāghava then heard the people coming from different quarters and the
7708,SECTION XVI.,"well-pleased citizens, talking amongst themselves regarding him in the"
7709,SECTION XVI.,"following strain. ""This Rāghava going shall obtain through the grace of"
7710,SECTION XVI.,"the king great wealth, and all our desires will be gratified when he"
7711,SECTION XVI.,will become our governor. It is a great gain to the subjects that he is
7712,SECTION XVI.,going to get for ever the entire empire at once; he being the lord of
7713,SECTION XVI.,"the people, no body shall witness any misfortune or unpleasant thing."""
7714,SECTION XVI.,"Like unto Vaisravana he began to proceed, being dignified by the horses"
7715,SECTION XVI.,"and elephants going before sending forth great sound, and eulogised in"
7716,SECTION XVI.,"various metres by persons singing his glory, by the panegyrists and by"
7717,SECTION XVI.,men tracing his noble ancestry. He saw the courtyard thronged with young
7718,SECTION XVI.,"and old elephants, horses, chariots, and the high-ways crowded all over"
7719,SECTION XVI.,"with people, many pearls and various merchandises."

7723,SECTION XVII.,SECTION XVII.
7724,SECTION XVII.,
7725,SECTION XVII.,
7726,SECTION XVII.,"Rāma, having his friends delighted, ascending the car, and viewing the"
7727,SECTION XVII.,city adorned with pennons and flags and incensed with _Dhupa_ and
7728,SECTION XVII.,"_Aguru_, entered the high way, crowded with people and containing houses"
7729,SECTION XVII.,"coloured as the pale white clouds, and the place between the two rows"
7730,SECTION XVII.,whereof scented with _Dhupa_ and _Aguru_. It was a splendidly spacious
7731,SECTION XVII.,"road decorated with a collection of sandal, _Aguru_ and other fine"
7732,SECTION XVII.,"scents, with silk and red cloth, with pearls holed and other valuable"
7733,SECTION XVII.,crystals and strewn with various flowers and filled with edibles
7734,SECTION XVII.,multiform. Like unto the lord of celestials in heaven he saw this high
7735,SECTION XVII.,"way and the court-yard covered with curd, clarified butter, fried paddy,"
7736,SECTION XVII.,"_Dhupa_, _Aguru_ and sandal, and embellished with garlands and other"
7737,SECTION XVII.,scents. Having heard benedictions uttered by many in the following
7738,SECTION XVII.,"strain and paying proper respects unto all, he wended his way. ""Being"
7739,SECTION XVII.,installed this day do thou following in the footsteps of thy father and
7740,SECTION XVII.,grand-fathers cherish and protect us. Thou taking the reins of
7741,SECTION XVII.,government we shall live more happily than what we were under your
7742,SECTION XVII.,ancestors. Seek not we earthly comforts or the highest things (in the
7743,SECTION XVII.,"life to come), if we can only see Rāma installed in the kingdom issuing"
7744,SECTION XVII.,out from his father’s abode. There is nothing more pleasant to us than
7745,SECTION XVII.,"the installation of the highly energetic Rāma on the throne."" Rāma,"
7746,SECTION XVII.,hearing these and other auspicious words from his friends eulogising his
7747,SECTION XVII.,"own self, went on his way without being moved. Rāghava passed away, but"
7748,SECTION XVII.,not a single person could withdraw his eyes and mind from that best of
7749,SECTION XVII.,"men. In fact he who did not see Rāma, and whom Rāma did not see, was"
7750,SECTION XVII.,looked down by all. and he considered himself contemptible. That
7751,SECTION XVII.,"righteous one showed mercy unto all, old and young, of the four castes,"
7752,SECTION XVII.,"and hence, thty were all obedient to him. He proceeded leaving on his"
7753,SECTION XVII.,"left side the junctions of four roads, the paths leading to temples, the"
7754,SECTION XVII.,"religious fig trees and altars, and reached after all the family"
7755,SECTION XVII.,"dwelling of the king, with its palatial tops piercing the sky, looking"
7756,SECTION XVII.,"beautiful, resembling mass of clouds, white as the celestial cars and"
7757,SECTION XVII.,"high as the hill Kailaça, and with sporting houses adorned with pearls."
7758,SECTION XVII.,"And the son of the monarch, shining in beauty, entered into the palace"
7759,SECTION XVII.,"of his father, the best on earth resembling the abode of Mahendra."
7760,SECTION XVII.,"Daçarātha’s son, the best of men, crossed in his chariot three"
7761,SECTION XVII.,"apartments guarded by warriors with bows in their hands, and other two"
7762,SECTION XVII.,"on foot, and in this way passing by all, and ordering his followers to"
7763,SECTION XVII.,"go back, entered the inner apartment. That son of the king entering into"
7764,SECTION XVII.,"the presence of his father, all were extremely gladdened and were"
7765,SECTION XVII.,eagerly expecting his return like unto the lord of water expecting the
7766,SECTION XVII.,appearance of the moon.

7769,SECTION XVII.,
7770,SECTION XVIII.,SECTION XVIII.
7771,SECTION XVIII.,
7772,SECTION XVIII.,
7773,SECTION XVIII.,"Rāma saw his father, seated on a beautiful sofa with Kaikeyi, looking"
7774,SECTION XVIII.,sorry and poorly and with his countenance dried up. And humbly bowing
7775,SECTION XVIII.,"down at the feet of his father first, he saluted Kaikeyi with due"
7776,SECTION XVIII.,"solemnity. Uttering the word ""Rāma"" only, the poor king with his eyes"
7777,SECTION XVIII.,full of tears could not eye him nor could he speak to him. Seeing this
7778,SECTION XVIII.,"unforeseen and terrible appearance of the king, like unto a serpent"
7779,SECTION XVIII.,"trampled under foot, Rāma was exceedingly terrified. He was dejected and"
7780,SECTION XVIII.,pulled down much with sorrow and penitence. He was sighing hot and hard
7781,SECTION XVIII.,and his heart was greatly pained. His heart was troubled like the wavy
7782,SECTION XVIII.,"ocean agitating though incapable of agitation,and clouded like the Sun"
7783,SECTION XVIII.,"possessed by Rāhu, and (that of) an ascetic speaking falsehood. Thinking"
7784,SECTION XVIII.,of this unthought of sorrow of the king he became agitated like unto the
7785,SECTION XVIII.,"ocean during the course of the full-moon. And clever Rāma, intent on bis"
7786,SECTION XVIII.,"father’s welfare, thought within himself:—""Why does not the king display"
7787,SECTION XVIII.,"joy on my arrival to-day? Angry though, he used to express joy whenever"
7788,SECTION XVIII.,"he saw me; then why does his sorrow prevail even seeing me to-day?"""
7789,SECTION XVIII.,"Being pressed with sorrow, Rāma of pale countenance, like one miserable,"
7790,SECTION XVIII.,"saluting Kaikeyi, spoke unto her the following words. ""Is it not that I"
7791,SECTION XVIII.,committed some offence through ignorance that I see my father angry? Do
7792,SECTION XVIII.,thou propitiate him therefore. Why is his mind so aggrieved who was so
7793,SECTION XVIII.,"kind to me, and why does he look poorly and of pale countenance who used"
7794,SECTION XVIII.,to welcome me always with kind words? Is he subject to any physical or
7795,SECTION XVIII.,mental disturbance? Oh! happiness uninterrupted is very dear. Has any
7796,SECTION XVIII.,evil befallen the good-looking Bharata or high souled Satrughana? Is it
7797,SECTION XVIII.,"not all well with my mothers? Dissatisfying the king, disregarding his"
7798,SECTION XVIII.,"words and offending him, I do not want to breathe for a single moment."
7799,SECTION XVIII.,"How can a man disregard him who is god himself seen and felt, and who is"
7800,SECTION XVIII.,"looked upon as a cause from whom he has sprung. Oh mother, hast thou"
7801,SECTION XVIII.,spoken any harsh word to my father either through anger or through
7802,SECTION XVIII.,"haughtiness for which his mind is thus pulled down? Oh worshipful one,"
7803,SECTION XVIII.,"tell me all this, who am exceedingly anxious to get at the real truth."
7804,SECTION XVIII.,"Why has this unforeseen sorrow overtaken the heart of the lord of men?"""
7805,SECTION XVIII.,
7806,SECTION XVIII.,"Being thus addressed by the high-souled Rāghava, that exceedingly"
7807,SECTION XVIII.,"shameless Kaikeyi spoke unto him the following impudent words, fraught"
7808,SECTION XVIII.,"with her self-interest. ""Oh Rāma, the monarch is not angry nor has any"
7809,SECTION XVIII.,danger befallen him. He has got something in his mind which he cannot
7810,SECTION XVIII.,speak out through thy fear. Thou art his most beloved son and word does
7811,SECTION XVIII.,not proceed from his mouth to speak thee things unpleasant. But it
7812,SECTION XVIII.,behoveth thee to carry out what the monarch has promised unto me.
7813,SECTION XVIII.,Formerly regarding me very highly he conferred on me two boons and he
7814,SECTION XVIII.,now repents for that like a common person. Promising ’I give thee’ the
7815,SECTION XVIII.,lord of earth granted me these boons; in vain he wishes to set up a dyke
7816,SECTION XVIII.,"when all the water has passed away. Oh Rāma, it is known to thee that"
7817,SECTION XVIII.,"truth is the root of all religion and may he not renounce that for thee,"
7818,SECTION XVIII.,being angry with me. If do thou carry out all that the king will speak
7819,SECTION XVIII.,"to thee, good or evil, then I shall relate unto thee every thing. If"
7820,SECTION XVIII.,"what I, with the king’s permission, speak to thee, does not go useless,"
7821,SECTION XVIII.,"I shall speak unto the all; thee king will not speak any thing."""
7822,SECTION XVIII.,
7823,SECTION XVIII.,"Hearing these words uttered by Kaikeyi, Rāma, pained at heart, spoke"
7824,SECTION XVIII.,"unto her in the presence of the king in the following way:—""Oh! shame to"
7825,SECTION XVIII.,"me. May it not please thee, Oh worshipful lady, to speak such words to"
7826,SECTION XVIII.,"me. I can at the king’s words jump into the fire. Being ordered by him,"
7827,SECTION XVIII.,"who is my father and who is my king especially, I can drink virulent"
7828,SECTION XVIII.,"poison and drown into the ocean. Speak thou, Oh worshipful lady, what is"
7829,SECTION XVIII.,"the desire of thy king, and know that I shall carry it out—Rāma does not"
7830,SECTION XVIII.,"contradict what he has once spoken."" Then that wicked Kaikeyi spoke"
7831,SECTION XVIII.,"these highly cruel words unto Rāma, simple and truthful. ""Formerly in a"
7832,SECTION XVIII.,"great war between the gods and Asuras, thy father, being wounded with"
7833,SECTION XVIII.,shafts was tended by me for which he conferred upon me two boons. Of
7834,SECTION XVIII.,"these two boons I have asked of the king the installation of Bharata,"
7835,SECTION XVIII.,and the departure of Rāghava into the Dandaka forest even this very day.
7836,SECTION XVIII.,"Oh thou, best among men, if do thou wish to keep thy father’s vows as"
7837,SECTION XVIII.,"well as thine, hear what I say. Thy father is bound unto me by promise,"
7838,SECTION XVIII.,"obeying therefore thy father’s mandate, do thou repair unto the forest"
7839,SECTION XVIII.,"for nine years and five. Bharata shall be installed, Oh Rāghava, by all"
7840,SECTION XVIII.,those articles which have been brought by the monarch for thy
7841,SECTION XVIII.,"installation. Forsaking this installation, do thou repair unto Dandaka"
7842,SECTION XVIII.,forest for seven and seven years and wear bark and matted hair. And here
7843,SECTION XVIII.,"in this Koçala let Bharata govern the world, adorned with many pearls"
7844,SECTION XVIII.,"and diamonds, with elephants, horses and chariots. The king, filled with"
7845,SECTION XVIII.,"pity and having his face marked with the affliction of sorrow, cannot"
7846,SECTION XVIII.,"cast a glance upon thee. Oh thou descendant of Raghu, do thou carry out"
7847,SECTION XVIII.,these words of the Lord of men and save him by redeeming these great
7848,SECTION XVIII.,"vows of his."" Hearing these cruel words of her, Rāma was not grieved;"
7849,SECTION XVIII.,but the generous king afflicted with the thought of the approaching
7850,SECTION XVIII.,"separation with his son, was greatly pained."
7851,SECTION XVIII.,
7852,SECTION XVIII.,
7853,SECTION XVIII.,
7854,SECTION XIX.,SECTION XIX.
7855,SECTION XIX.,
7856,SECTION XIX.,
7857,SECTION XIX.,"Hearing these unpleasant words like unto death, Rāma, the destroyer of"
7858,SECTION XIX.,"foes, was not pained, and spoke thus unto Kaikeyi. ""Be it what thou"
7859,SECTION XIX.,"sayst; carrying out the promise of the king, I shall repair unto the"
7860,SECTION XIX.,forest from this place wearing bark and matted hair. Now I want to know
7861,SECTION XIX.,"only why that lord of the earth, invincible and the conqueror of foes,"
7862,SECTION XIX.,does not receive me in the same way as he used to do on previous
7863,SECTION XIX.,"occasions. Be not angry, Oh worshipful one, I speak before thee, be thou"
7864,SECTION XIX.,"propitiated well, and I shall go to the forest wearing bark and matted"
7865,SECTION XIX.,"hair. What is there that I cannot perform, considering it good without"
7866,SECTION XIX.,"suspicion, if I am ordered so by my well-wisher, spiritual leader,"
7867,SECTION XIX.,"father and king, who acknowledges thy service (rendered in time of"
7868,SECTION XIX.,"danger¹¹⁷). But this one sorrow burns my heart, why king did not tell me"
7869,SECTION XIX.,personally of the installation of Bharata. What of the command of the
7870,SECTION XIX.,"king, my father, I shall even at thy mandate joyfully make over unto"
7871,SECTION XIX.,"Bharata, my kingdom, Sitā, wealth and even my life, thereby satisfying"
7872,SECTION XIX.,"thee, aad fulfilling my promise. Do thou now console the bashful king;"
7873,SECTION XIX.,"why has he, with his eyes steadily fixed on the ground, been shedding"
7874,SECTION XIX.,"tears slowly? Let messengers, with fast going steeds go to-day at the"
7875,SECTION XIX.,command of the king to fetch Bharata from his maternal uncle’s house.
7876,SECTION XIX.,"And I shall, not even judging the propriety of my father’s words,"
7877,SECTION XIX.,"speedily repair unto the forest of Dandaka for fourteen years."" Hearing"
7878,SECTION XIX.,"those words of Rāma, Kaikeyi was pleased, and being certain about his"
7879,SECTION XIX.,"departure, hurried on Rāghava. ""Let it be that messengers with fast"
7880,SECTION XIX.,going steeds shall go to bring Bharata from his maternal uncle’s
7881,SECTION XIX.,"residence. I do not think it proper for thee, O Rāma, to delay, when"
7882,SECTION XIX.,thou art so anxious; it behoves thee therefore to depart from this place
7883,SECTION XIX.,"speedily unto the forest. The king being abashed, does not himself"
7884,SECTION XIX.,"address thee, there is nothing else than this. Do thou, Oh best of men,"
7885,SECTION XIX.,dispel this wretchedness of his. As long as thou shalt not hurriedly
7886,SECTION XIX.,"depart froth his presence, Oh Rāma. thy father shall not bathe, or eat"
7887,SECTION XIX.,"anything."" ’Oh fie!’ ’what affliction’ sobbing hard with these words,"
7888,SECTION XIX.,"the monarch, filled with sorrow, swooned away and fell down upon the"
7889,SECTION XIX.,"sofa, embellished with gold. Raising the king up, Rāma, being directed"
7890,SECTION XIX.,"by Kaikeyi, began to hurry on his departure to the forest, like unto a"
7891,SECTION XIX.,steed struck sharp with a whip. Hearing those cruel and unpleasant words
7892,SECTION XIX.,"of the wicked Kaikeyi, Rāma, not being distressed, began to address her"
7893,SECTION XIX.,"with the following words. ""Oh worshipful one, being addicted to wealth"
7894,SECTION XIX.,"do I not long for living in this world; like unto Rishis, know me, to be"
7895,SECTION XIX.,"well established in pure religion. If I can, even at the sacrifice of my"
7896,SECTION XIX.,"own life, satisfy my worshipful father rest assured it is to be done"
7897,SECTION XIX.,first in all manner. There is no virtue greater than the serving of the
7898,SECTION XIX.,"father and carrying out his words. Even though not commanded by him, I"
7899,SECTION XIX.,"shall; for thy words, live in a solitary forest for fourteen years. Oh"
7900,SECTION XIX.,"Kaikeyi, certain it is that thou art not acquainted with my foremost"
7901,SECTION XIX.,"virtues, inasmuch as possessing full authority to rule me, thou hast"
7902,SECTION XIX.,"requested the monarch for this. Excuse me until I ask my mother, and"
7903,SECTION XIX.,comfort Sitā; even this very day shall I wend my way unto the great
7904,SECTION XIX.,forest of Dandaka. It behoves thee to do that by which Bharata may
7905,SECTION XIX.,"govern the kingdom and tend our father, for this is the virtue eternal."""
7906,SECTION XIX.,"Hearing these words of Rāma, his father, greatly afflicted and incapable"
7907,SECTION XIX.,"of speaking anything on account of sorrow, began to cry aloud."
7908,SECTION XIX.,"Worshipping the feet of the king lying insensible, and those of vicious"
7909,SECTION XIX.,"Kaikeyi, that greatly effulgent one went out. And reverentially going"
7910,SECTION XIX.,"round his father and Kaikeyi, and issuing out of the female apartment,"
7911,SECTION XIX.,"Rāma saw his own friends and relatives. Then followed him Lakshmana, the"
7912,SECTION XIX.,"enhancer of Sumitrā’s joy, greatly angry and with his eyes full of"
7913,SECTION XIX.,tears. Going round with reverence the house of instalation full of
7914,SECTION XIX.,"necessary articles, not turning away from it his wistful look, Rāma"
7915,SECTION XIX.,began to proceed slowly. Loss of kingdom could not diminish the great
7916,SECTION XIX.,beauty of that beloved of the people on account of its everlasting
7917,SECTION XIX.,"pleasantness, like unto the wane of the moon. There was manifest in him"
7918,SECTION XIX.,"no change of mind, who was about to fly as an exile to the forest and"
7919,SECTION XIX.,"leave the world, like unto one emancipated while yet living. Leaving"
7920,SECTION XIX.,"aside the excellent umbrella and well adorned _chowries_, forsaking his"
7921,SECTION XIX.,"relatives, chariot, citizens and other people, calmly bearing the"
7922,SECTION XIX.,"affliction in mind and not manifesting the outward signs of sorrow,"
7923,SECTION XIX.,"Rāma, with a view to communicate this unpleasant news to his mother,"
7924,SECTION XIX.,"entered her abode. All persons, who were present there and who adorned"
7925,SECTION XIX.,"themselves on account of the installation, did not percieve any sign of"
7926,SECTION XIX.,mental agony on the face of Rāma. Like unto the rays of the fully
7927,SECTION XIX.,"brilliant autumnal moon, that hero of mighty arms, having control over"
7928,SECTION XIX.,"himself, did not forsake his native cheerfulness. The pious Rāma, having"
7929,SECTION XIX.,"high fame, entered into the presence of his mother, manifesting great"
7930,SECTION XIX.,"regards for the people with sweet speech. Then followed him, the son of"
7931,SECTION XIX.,"Sumitrā, of mighty prowess, of equal accomplishments with his brother,"
7932,SECTION XIX.,"and bearing the mental sorrow. Rāma, entering the abode of his mother,"
7933,SECTION XIX.,saw it filled with all sorts of amusements; and even though his mind was
7934,SECTION XIX.,not agitated with any mental disturbance seeing the impending calamity
7935,SECTION XIX.,"of loss of wealth, he was anxious lest the lives of his dear relatives"
7936,SECTION XIX.,might be in danger.
7937,SECTION XIX.,
7938,SECTION XIX.,¹¹⁷ The epithet _Kritajnena_ may as well be rendered into general
7939,SECTION XIX.,terms; such as ’who acknowledges services rendered onto him.’ Here
7940,SECTION XIX.,in translation I have followed the commentator who has restricted
7941,SECTION XIX.,it to the special sense suitable to the occasion.— T.

7948,SECTION XX.,"There arose a great uproar of cry in the apartment of the females, when"

7950,SECTION XX.,serve all the females in all matters even without his father’s
7951,SECTION XX.,"permission, who was our stay and protector, is going to the forest."
7952,SECTION XX.,Rāghava from his birth pays as much attention to us as to his mother

7954,SECTION XX.,wrathful and studiously avoids words and deeds that excite anger in

7956,SECTION XX.,"king, who forsakes Rāghava who is the stay of all people, and thus kills"
7957,SECTION XX.,"his subjects."" Thus the queens of Daçarātha, like unto the cows that"
7958,SECTION XX.,"have lost their young ones, began to blame him and cry aloud. Hearing"
7959,SECTION XX.,"this terrible uproar of cry in the female apartment, that lord of earth,"
7960,SECTION XX.,"racked with sorrow on account of his son, hid himself in the seat (with"
7961,SECTION XX.,"head hanging downdards). Rāma too, having control over his own self,"
7962,SECTION XX.,experiencing sorrow (for his relatives) and sobbing like an (enchained)
7963,SECTION XX.,"elephant, entered into his mother’s apartment together with his brother."
7964,SECTION XX.,"He saw a venerable old man, sitting at the gate and many other persons."
7965,SECTION XX.,"All those present, seeing Rāma, began to shower benedictions on him, the"

7967,SECTION XX.,"passed through the first apartment he saw in the second, many old"
7968,SECTION XX.,"Brahmins, versed in the Vedas and honored by the king. Having bowed down"
7969,SECTION XX.,"unto them, Rāma saw in the third apartment, women, boys, and old men,"
7970,SECTION XX.,all engaged in watching the gate. The female warders honored Rāma
7971,SECTION XX.,"rejoicing, and entering his mother’s apartment, communicated unto her"
7972,SECTION XX.,"speedily this pleasant news. Worshipful Kauçalyā, seeking her son’s"
7973,SECTION XX.,"welfare, kept up the whole night being absorbed in meditation, and was,"
7974,SECTION XX.,"in the morning, worshipping the God Vishnu. Wearing silk-cloth, pleased,"
7975,SECTION XX.,"and accustomed to the performance of religious rites every day, she,"
7976,SECTION XX.,"performing benedictory ceremonies, was offering oblation unto the fire."
7977,SECTION XX.,Rāma entering the auspicious abode of his mother beheld her thus engaged
7978,SECTION XX.,"in the sacrifice to the fire. The descendant of Raghu saw there, brought"

7980,SECTION XX.,"sweetmeats, things fit for oblations unto the fire, fried paddy, white"
7981,SECTION XX.,"garlands, rice boiled in milk and sugar, rice sesamum and pea mixtures,"
7982,SECTION XX.,sacrficial fuels and jars full of water. He saw his virtuous mother
7983,SECTION XX.,"wearing white silk, pulled down by the austere performance of religious"
7984,SECTION XX.,"rites, and engaged in propitiating the deities with the offering of"
7985,SECTION XX.,"water. She seeing her son, ever advancing the joy of his mother,"
7986,SECTION XX.,"approach, became pleased, and stepped forward like unto a mare beholding"
7987,SECTION XX.,"her young one. Seeing his mother approach, Rāghava bowed low, and"
7988,SECTION XX.,"(Kauçalyā) embracing him in her arms smelt his head. Kauçalyā, out of"
7989,SECTION XX.,"motherly affection, spoke these sweet and beneficient words unto her own"
7990,SECTION XX.,"invincible son, Rāghava. ""Mayst thou obtain the life and fame of the"
7991,SECTION XX.,"pious, old _Rajarshis_, and the virtue worthy of thy family. See, Oh"
7992,SECTION XX.,"Rāghava, how truthful is your father the king! That virtuous- souled one"
7993,SECTION XX.,"shall install thee this day as the heir-apparent of the throne."""
7994,SECTION XX.,"Rāghava, humble by nature, who was offered by his mother a seat and"
7995,SECTION XX.,"asked by her to eat something, streching forth a little his clasped"
7996,SECTION XX.,"hands, and with his head downwards with a view to show respects towards"
7997,SECTION XX.,"his mother, touched the seat, and began to relate unto her the object of"
7998,SECTION XX.,"his repairing unto the Dandaka forest. ""O worshipful one, certain it is"
7999,SECTION XX.,that thou knowest not the great impending calamity. It is for the
8000,SECTION XX.,"distress of thine, Lakshmana and Vaidehi, that shall I wend my way unto"
8001,SECTION XX.,the Dandaka forest. What is the use of a seat to me then? Now is the
8002,SECTION XX.,time come when I deserve a seat made of Kusa grass. I shall live in the
8003,SECTION XX.,forest for fourteen years abstaining from animal food and living on
8004,SECTION XX.,tuberous roots and fruits like unto the ascetics. The king shall confer
8005,SECTION XX.,upon Bharata the heir-apparentship and shall banish me as an ascetic
8006,SECTION XX.,into the forest. And I shall live in that solitary forest for eight and
8007,SECTION XX.,"six years, feasting on roots, and fruits and performing the duties of a"
8008,SECTION XX.,"hermit."" Like unto the stem of a _sala_ tree cut asunder by an axe in a"
8009,SECTION XX.,"wood, like unto a female celestial fallen down from the abode of the"
8010,SECTION XX.,"gods, she fell down suddenly (hearing these heart-rending words.) Rāma"
8011,SECTION XX.,"seeing his mother, who deserved no distress, fall down like a plantain"
8012,SECTION XX.,"tree and insensible, raised her up, and finding her covered with dust"
8013,SECTION XX.,all over her body like unto a mare risen up after rolling on the ground
8014,SECTION XX.,on account of toil of bearing heavy burden wiped oflf (her body) gently
8015,SECTION XX.,"with his hand. She, deserving happiness, being racked with the"
8016,SECTION XX.,"destruction of her delight spoke thus unto Rāghava, that best of men, in"
8017,SECTION XX.,"the presence of Lakshmana. ""Oh! my son, Oh! Rāghava, hadst thou not been"
8018,SECTION XX.,"born for my grief I would have been sonless only, but would not have"
8019,SECTION XX.,been subject to this greater grief. A sonless woman has only one cause
8020,SECTION XX.,"of mental affliction. Her only sorrow is ""I have no child"" and nothing"
8021,SECTION XX.,else my son. I have not experienced in my life that blessing and
8022,SECTION XX.,pleasure which women generally feel when their husbands are devoted to
8023,SECTION XX.,"them. I have sustained my life so long, O Rāma, only with the hope that"
8024,SECTION XX.,I shall witness this and other happiness when I shall have a son.
8025,SECTION XX.,"Myself, being the eldest of all the queens, shall have to hear"
8026,SECTION XX.,unpleasant and heart-rending words from the co-wives who are all younger
8027,SECTION XX.,than I. There can be no greater misery for women than this my boundless
8028,SECTION XX.,"grief and lamentations. Thou being present, they have reduced me to this"
8029,SECTION XX.,"miserable plight, I do not know what else they will do, thou being away;"
8030,SECTION XX.,"there is death certain for me, Oh my darling! Being disregarded by my"
8031,SECTION XX.,husband I have been greatly insulted—I am equal to the maid-servants of
8032,SECTION XX.,Kaikeyi or even inferior to them. Those who serve me or are obedient
8033,SECTION XX.,"unto me, shall not even speak with me when they will see the son of"
8034,SECTION XX.,"Kaikeyi (installed). She is always of fretful temper, how shall I,"
8035,SECTION XX.,"reduced to misery (on account of thy exile), eye the face of Kaikeyi,"
8036,SECTION XX.,"uttering harsh words. I have spent, Oh Rāghava, ten years and seven from"
8037,SECTION XX.,thy (second) birth¹¹⁸ expecting a termination of my sorrow. Even though
8038,SECTION XX.,"worn out, Oh Rāghava, I shall not be able to suffer this great misery"
8039,SECTION XX.,cosequent upon thy unending exile and the contempt of the co-wives. How
8040,SECTION XX.,"shall I, of miserable life pass my days in grief not seeing thy face,"
8041,SECTION XX.,"effulgent like unto the full-moon. Wretched as I am, in vain have I"
8042,SECTION XX.,"brought thee up with fasts, contemplations and many other toilsome"
8043,SECTION XX.,"austerities. Surely, I consider my heart is very hard, as it does not"
8044,SECTION XX.,rend like unto the bank of a great river in contact with new water in
8045,SECTION XX.,the rainy season. There is no death for me— no vacant place in the abode
8046,SECTION XX.,of Yama; otherwise why does not Death take me away like unto a lion
8047,SECTION XX.,snatching away a weeping hind; certain it is that my heart is made of
8048,SECTION XX.,"iron, as it does not rend nor does my body being pressed down with this"
8049,SECTION XX.,"sorrow and falling) down on earth, break into pieces; verily have I no"
8050,SECTION XX.,"death before time. This distresses me that all my religious vows, alms"
8051,SECTION XX.,"givings, self-restraint and austerity, performed with a view of"
8052,SECTION XX.,"obtaining a son, have been fruitless, like unto the seeds thrown on a"
8053,SECTION XX.,"barren soil. If any body in this life, being pressed down with some"
8054,SECTION XX.,"great calamity, could meet with death of his own accord, I would have"
8055,SECTION XX.,"instantly gone to the abode of dealh, being cut off from thee like unto"
8056,SECTION XX.,"a cow from her young one. Oh, thou, having a countenance of moon-like"
8057,SECTION XX.,"splendour, wretched indeed is my life without thee—I shall follow thee"
8058,SECTION XX.,"to the forest out of great affection, like unto an enfeebled cow"
8059,SECTION XX.,following her young one. Kauçalyā like a Kinnari unable to bear this
8060,SECTION XX.,"great calamity, anticipating some great misfortune and seeing Rāma bound"
8061,SECTION XX.,"(with a great vow), began to lament in various ways."
8062,SECTION XX.,
8063,SECTION XX.,¹¹⁸ Here the commentators differ in fixing the age of Rāma at the time
8064,SECTION XX.,of his going to the forest. Rāma’s age was under sixteen at the
8065,SECTION XX.,"time of marriage, and after he was married to Sica he enjoyed her"
8066,SECTION XX.,"company for twelve years, when the proposal of installation was"
8067,SECTION XX.,made. This makes totally an age of twenty-seven. In the text
8068,SECTION XX.,’_dasa saptacha_’ (ten and seven) ten years fall short which are
8069,SECTION XX.,to be made up by taking into account the age of ten being left
8070,SECTION XX.,"out, preceding Rāma’s entering into the second birth which begins"
8071,SECTION XX.,at _maunji-bandhana_ or initiation into the mysteries of the Vedic
8072,SECTION XX.,"literature. Following the example of Bhashyakara Patanjali, the"
8073,SECTION XX.,"commentator, Rāmanuju has in the sentence ’dasa saptacha’ supplied"
8074,SECTION XX.,"another (dasa) (ten) by means of ellipsis, thus giving an age of"
8075,SECTION XX.,"twenty-seven. This, however, contradicts the statement of Sitā to"
8076,SECTION XX.,"Rāvana in guise of an anchorite, informing him of the age of her"
8077,SECTION XX.,husband being twenty-five. A modern annotator with great ingenuity
8078,SECTION XX.,has devised ways to make up this discrepancy. The age of Rāma was
8079,SECTION XX.,"under sixteen, when Visvamitra asked his assistance in destroying"
8080,SECTION XX.,Tārakā. ’Under sixteen’ may mean fifteen or twelve as well. After
8081,SECTION XX.,"marriage at twelve, Rāma enjoyed twelve years more the pleasure of"
8082,SECTION XX.,"home. This giving in total twenty-four, it is to be supposed that"
8083,SECTION XX.,when he was exiled he stepped at twenty-five. The text ’_dasa
8084,SECTION XX.,"saptacha_’ is correct, considering the age of eight being left out"
8085,SECTION XX.,preceding his second birth at the initiation into the mysteries of
8086,SECTION XX.,the Veda.

8092,SECTION XXI.,
8093,SECTION XXI.,"At this time Lakshmana, sorely distressed, addressed the weeping"
8094,SECTION XXI.,"Kauçalyā, the mother of Rāma with the following words suitable to that"
8095,SECTION XXI.,"occasion. ""I like it not, Oh worshipful one, that Rāghava, should repair"
8096,SECTION XXI.,"unto the forest, renouncing this grandeur of sovereignty. The king is"
8097,SECTION XXI.,"uxorious, old and therefore of perverted judgment and is addicted to"
8098,SECTION XXI.,worldly affairs; being under the influence of his wife and passion what
8099,SECTION XXI.,could he not speak? I do not see any such fault or sin in Rāma that he
8100,SECTION XXI.,should be banished from the kingdom to range in the wood. I do not find
8101,SECTION XXI.,"any such man in this world, even amongst great enemies, who, forsaken"
8102,SECTION XXI.,"for heinous sins, can cite, even in his absence, any fault of him."
8103,SECTION XXI.,"Observing what law of righteousness does the monarch, without any cause,"
8104,SECTION XXI.,"renounce such a son who is like unto celestials, simple, well"
8105,SECTION XXI.,"disciplined and beloved even of the enemies? What son, remembering his"
8106,SECTION XXI.,"father’s conduct, shall carry in his heart these words of the king, who"
8107,SECTION XXI.,has again gone back to childhood? Ere people come to know this proposal
8108,SECTION XXI.,"of exile, do thou secure the government of the kingdom unto thyself with"
8109,SECTION XXI.,"me. Who can disturb the installation, Oh Rāghava, myself protecting thee"
8110,SECTION XXI.,"by thy side with my bows, like unto Death himself. If any body stands"
8111,SECTION XXI.,"here as an enemy, surely shall I, Oh best of men, depopulate the whole"
8112,SECTION XXI.,city of Ayodhyā with sharp arrows. I shall immolate all who shall stand
8113,SECTION XXI.,by Bharata or wish him well—certainly mildness brings about
8114,SECTION XXI.,"discomfiture. If father being propitiated and excited by Kaikeyi, turns"
8115,SECTION XXI.,"out to be our enemy, he shall be slain, without any hesitation. Even a"
8116,SECTION XXI.,"spiritual leader deserves chastisement if he is puffed up with pride,"
8117,SECTION XXI.,"and is devoid of the power of judging good actions and bad, and when he"
8118,SECTION XXI.,"is gone astray. Tell me, Oh best of men, by what law of virtue and what"
8119,SECTION XXI.,"reason does he purpose to confer this kingdom upon Kaikeyi, which has"
8120,SECTION XXI.,devolved upon thee (by the law of inheritance). Who dares conferring on
8121,SECTION XXI.,"Bharata the kingdom, carrying hostility with me and thee? Oh worshipful"
8122,SECTION XXI.,"one, verily am I attached at heart to my brother. By truth, bow, gifts"
8123,SECTION XXI.,"and things dear unto me, do I swear unto thee; if Rāma shall enter into"
8124,SECTION XXI.,"the wood, know me, Oh worshipful one, to have entered into the fire"
8125,SECTION XXI.,"before that Like unto the sun dispelling darkness, shall I remove thy"
8126,SECTION XXI.,sorrow by dint of my power; may your worshipful self and Rāghava witness
8127,SECTION XXI.,"it. Readily shall I despatch my father, whose heart is unduly attached"
8128,SECTION XXI.,unto Kaikeyi and who is therefore vile and being old contemptibly
8129,SECTION XXI.,"playing the child."" Hearing these words of the high-souled Lakshmana,"
8130,SECTION XXI.,Kauçalyā weeping and being pressed with sorrow spoke these words unto
8131,SECTION XXI.,"Rāma. ""You have heard, Oh my son, what your brother Lakshmana said; and"
8132,SECTION XXI.,"if you like, do what seems reasonable unto thee. It does not behove"
8133,SECTION XXI.,"thee, hearing the sinful words given vent to by the co-wife, to repair"
8134,SECTION XXI.,"hence, leaving me who is sore distressed with sorrow. Oh thou pious one,"
8135,SECTION XXI.,"having knowledge of religion, if do thou wish to acquire righteousness,"
8136,SECTION XXI.,"serve me here and continue practising the best of all virtues. Hear, Oh"
8137,SECTION XXI.,"my son, the great ascetic Kasyapa, lived in his house, serving his"
8138,SECTION XXI.,mother continually and being crowned with best moral merit reached
8139,SECTION XXI.,heaven. As the monarch is worshipful unto thee in veneration so am I. I
8140,SECTION XXI.,"do not permit thee, to repair hence unto the forest. Separated from thee"
8141,SECTION XXI.,I do not need life or happiness; with thee I would prefer faring on
8142,SECTION XXI.,grass. If do thou depart unto the forest leaving me troubled with
8143,SECTION XXI.,"sorrow, I shall resort to the vow of fasting and shall not be able to"
8144,SECTION XXI.,"sustain my life. And then thou shalt receive the penalty of hell, well"
8145,SECTION XXI.,"known to the people, as did the ocean, the lord of rivers, for like,"
8146,SECTION XXI.,"unrighteousness, suffer the agony of Brahminicide.""¹¹⁹ Whereupon unto"
8147,SECTION XXI.,"his mother Kauçalyā, sorrowful and weeping, spoke Rāma, virtuous-souled,"
8148,SECTION XXI.,"these words of righteousness. ""There is no power in me to transgress my"
8149,SECTION XXI.,father’s behests; bend low I my head unto thee—I want to proceed to the
8150,SECTION XXI.,"forest. The learned Rishi Kandu, who lived in the forest keeping the"
8151,SECTION XXI.,"word of his father, killed a cow, knowing it to be unrighteousness. In"
8152,SECTION XXI.,"our line the descendants of Sāgara, at the command of their father, met"
8153,SECTION XXI.,"with signal destruction, while digging the earth. Rāma the son of"
8154,SECTION XXI.,"Jāmadagni, at his father’s words, decapitated his mother in the forest."
8155,SECTION XXI.,"These and other god-like personages, Oh worshipful one, obeyed"
8156,SECTION XXI.,heroically the orders of their father; and I shall do my father’s
8157,SECTION XXI.,welfare therefore. It is not I alone who am carrying out my father’s
8158,SECTION XXI.,"commands; those whom I have mentioned now, O worshipful one, have done"
8159,SECTION XXI.,"so. I am not introducing some such righteousness, unfavourable unto"
8160,SECTION XXI.,"thee, that has been never practised before. I am simply treading the"
8161,SECTION XXI.,"path, that has been upheld and followed by worthies gone before. Surely"
8162,SECTION XXI.,shall I accomplish that which is worthy of being performed in this world
8163,SECTION XXI.,and nothing else—one going by his father’s behests is not certainly
8164,SECTION XXI.,"degraded."""
8165,SECTION XXI.,
8166,SECTION XXI.,"Saying these words unto his mother, that best of men versed in speech"
8167,SECTION XXI.,"and best of archers, again spoke unto Lakshmana all these words. ""I know"
8168,SECTION XXI.,"full well, Oh Lakshmana, thy affection towards me and thy power,"
8169,SECTION XXI.,strength and unconquerable force. Not knowing my settted conviction in
8170,SECTION XXI.,"regard to truth and peace, my mother, Oh beautiful Lakshmana, is so"
8171,SECTION XXI.,disturbed with incomparable sorrow. Righteousness is the prime object in
8172,SECTION XXI.,"this world and in righteousness is established truth, and this excellent"
8173,SECTION XXI.,utterance of my father is in keeping with righteousness. It does not
8174,SECTION XXI.,"become them, O hero, who abide in righteousness to fail to carry out the"
8175,SECTION XXI.,"commands of father, mother or a Brahmin. While I have been, Oh warrior,"
8176,SECTION XXI.,"ordered by Kaikeyi at my father’s words, I shall not be able to"
8177,SECTION XXI.,transgress those behests again. Do thou relinquish therefore this
8178,SECTION XXI.,unrighteous purpose of thine consequent to the virtues of the
8179,SECTION XXI.,"Kshatriyas; do thou abide by righteousness but not cruelty, and follow"
8180,SECTION XXI.,"my decision."" Saying these words unto Lakshmana out of fraternal"
8181,SECTION XXI.,"affection, spoke again Rāma to Kauçalyā with clasped hands and with his"
8182,SECTION XXI.,"head bending low. ""I do bind thee with an oath of my life, Oh venerable"
8183,SECTION XXI.,"one, to allow me to wander away hence into the wood. Do thou perform"
8184,SECTION XXI.,benedictory ceremonies for my welfare. Like unto the royal saint
8185,SECTION XXI.,_Yayati_ in the days of yore once falling on earth going again to the
8186,SECTION XXI.,"abode of celestials, I shall, fulfilling my vows, again return home from"
8187,SECTION XXI.,"the forest. Do thou, Oh mother, assuage thy grief within thy heart;"
8188,SECTION XXI.,"lament not thou, I shall return home again from the wood after making"
8189,SECTION XXI.,"good my father’s words. Myself, Lakshmana, Vaidehi, Sumitrā and thyself"
8190,SECTION XXI.,"shall abide by father’s words, and this is the virtue eternal. Desisting"
8191,SECTION XXI.,from the ceremonies of installation and allaying thy sorrow in thy heart
8192,SECTION XXI.,"do thou, Oh my mother, follow my pious decision about retiring to the"
8193,SECTION XXI.,"forest"". Hearing those pious, sober and reasonable words of Rāma, the"
8194,SECTION XXI.,"venerable mother, regaining her sense like unto the dead, and casting"
8195,SECTION XXI.,"her look upon him, spoke to him again the following words. ""I am equally"
8196,SECTION XXI.,"worshipful unto thee, Oh my son, with your father, for like him have I"
8197,SECTION XXI.,brought thee up with pains and like him do I love thee. I shall not
8198,SECTION XXI.,allow thee to repair unto the forest and it does not behove thee to go
8199,SECTION XXI.,"leaving me behind sore distresssd with grief. Without thee, of what"
8200,SECTION XXI.,"avail to me is my life, my relatives, the worship of the manes and the"
8201,SECTION XXI.,deities and the knowledge of divine truth on this earth? Prefer do I thy
8202,SECTION XXI.,"company even for a moment to the presence of all creation."" Hearing"
8203,SECTION XXI.,"these sorrowful words of his mother, Rāma was again inflamed with ire,"
8204,SECTION XXI.,"like unto an elephant goaded with a fire-brand, when entering into"
8205,SECTION XXI.,"darkness. He, abiding in righteousness spoke such pious words unto his"
8206,SECTION XXI.,"mother, almost insensible, and unto the son of Sumitrā, bewailing and"
8207,SECTION XXI.,"racked with sorrow, as he was justified to utter on that occasion. ""I"
8208,SECTION XXI.,"know, Oh Lakshmana, thy deep respects unto me and thy power. It is not"
8209,SECTION XXI.,"proper for thee to pain me along with my mother, not being cognizant of"
8210,SECTION XXI.,"my intention. Righteousness, wealth, and the objects of desire are"
8211,SECTION XXI.,looked upon with great esteem in this world of the created but when the
8212,SECTION XXI.,occasion for obtaining the result consequent upon the virtuous deeds of
8213,SECTION XXI.,"a prior life appears, all these three, I have no doubt, are fulfilled in"
8214,SECTION XXI.,"righteousness, as the wife alone, obedient, charming and having a son"
8215,SECTION XXI.,(fulfils them all). It is not becoming for us to perform all those
8216,SECTION XXI.,things where these three do not combine—whence results righteousness
8217,SECTION XXI.,"that we should resort to. A man seeking wealth becomes despicable, and"
8218,SECTION XXI.,one subject to desires is not admired by any (when bereft of
8219,SECTION XXI.,"righteousness). Who of us, having no tendency to wickedness, shall not"
8220,SECTION XXI.,"obey the command of our father knowing it to be righteousness, who is"
8221,SECTION XXI.,"old, our monarch and preceptor in military training, be it an outcome of"
8222,SECTION XXI.,"his desires, anger or joy. For this it is that I am unable to act"
8223,SECTION XXI.,against my father’s vow—he is our father and therefore can command us
8224,SECTION XXI.,"both like a master; and he is the husband of this venerable one,"
8225,SECTION XXI.,therefore her stay and righteousness itself. The righteous monarch is
8226,SECTION XXI.,still living and continues in his own path when ready to redeem his vow
8227,SECTION XXI.,even by renouncing me—how can this worshipful one accompany me like
8228,SECTION XXI.,"other insignificant widows? Do thou permit me therefore, to repair unto"
8229,SECTION XXI.,the forest and perform benedictory ceremonies for me so that I may again
8230,SECTION XXI.,return home like unto Yajati regaining heaven by truth. I cannot neglect
8231,SECTION XXI.,eminent fame being impelled by avarice for kingdom alone. Life is but of
8232,SECTION XXI.,"short duration, Oh worshipful one, and as such I do not long for"
8233,SECTION XXI.,"acquiring this nether earth by means unrighteous."" Rāma, that foremost"
8234,SECTION XXI.,"of men, with a view to range into the forest Dandaka after patiently"
8235,SECTION XXI.,propitiating his mother and instructing fully his younger brother the
8236,SECTION XXI.,"mysteries of righteousness, went round his mother with reverence and"
8237,SECTION XXI.,made up his mind to repair unto the forest.
8238,SECTION XXI.,
8239,SECTION XXI.,¹¹⁹ The text has been here a little freely translated to make it
8240,SECTION XXI.,"compatible with the legend to which it refers. The ocean, thus"
8241,SECTION XXI.,"goes the story, caused the grief of his mother. Upon which,"
8242,SECTION XXI.,"Maharshi Pippyalada, through magical power, subjected him to agony"
8243,SECTION XXI.,of hell. This agony the mother of Rāma relates as the same that

8253,SECTION XXII.,"who was greatly sorry, had lost his patience and was pressed down with"
8254,SECTION XXII.,"this misfortune of Rāma, and had his eyes inflated with anger like unto"

8256,SECTION XXII.,"to patience only, brooking the insult and resorting to joy, do thou set"
8257,SECTION XXII.,aside all those things that have been collected here for my installation
8258,SECTION XXII.,and make preparations speedily for my repairing to the forest. Oh son of
8259,SECTION XXII.,"Sumitrā, do thou take that amount of trouble for preventing now the"
8260,SECTION XXII.,"collection of materials for installation, as didst thou take beforehand"
8261,SECTION XXII.,for collecting them. Do thou act therefore in such a way as will remove
8262,SECTION XXII.,"the apprehension from the mind of our mother (Kaikeyi), who is troubled"
8263,SECTION XXII.,"at heart so greatly on hearing of my installation. O son of Sumitrā, I"
8264,SECTION XXII.,cannot neglect for a moment the trouble which hass arisen in her mind on
8265,SECTION XXII.,account of this fear. I do not remember to have done on any occasion
8266,SECTION XXII.,wilfully or unwilfully any thing that is displeasing onto my father or
8267,SECTION XXII.,mothers. My father is of truthful words and vows and he has been greatly
8268,SECTION XXII.,terrified by the fear of the next world; may his fear disappear now. If
8269,SECTION XXII.,"this work of installation be not stopped, my father shall be greatly"
8270,SECTION XXII.,pained at heart thinking that his vows shall not be fulfilled and his
8271,SECTION XXII.,"sorrow will also ache me. And it is for this reason, Oh Lakshmana, that"
8272,SECTION XXII.,"I purpose speedily to retire from this city to the forest, renouncing"
8273,SECTION XXII.,the preparations for my installation. On my wandering away unto the
8274,SECTION XXII.,"forest to-day, the daughter of Kekaya shall have her ends attained and"
8275,SECTION XXII.,shall install Bharata on the throne without any disturbance whatsoever.
8276,SECTION XXII.,"Myself going to the forest, wearing bark, tiger-skin and matted hair,"
8277,SECTION XXII.,"Kaikeyi shall attain the happiness of her mind. That great One, who has"
8278,SECTION XXII.,"inspired Kaikeyi with this mode of mind and has kept it firm, I cannot"
8279,SECTION XXII.,"offend. I shall repair hence without any delay. Do thou regard, Oh"
8280,SECTION XXII.,"Lakshmana, Destiny as the only cause of this transfer of the kingdom,"
8281,SECTION XXII.,"although attained, and of my banishment. Had not Destiny been"
8282,SECTION XXII.,"instrumental in bringing about this determination in Kaikeyi, she would"
8283,SECTION XXII.,not have been so much persevering in the infliction of misery upon me.
8284,SECTION XXII.,"Knowest thou, Oh gentle Lakshmana, that I have never made any"
8285,SECTION XXII.,"distinction in my mind between my mothers, nor did Kaikeyi make any such"

8287,SECTION XXII.,that has made her press for the prevention of my installation and for my
8288,SECTION XXII.,"exile with harsh and cruel words, or else why should she, a daughter of"
8289,SECTION XXII.,"a king and possessed of an excellent temper and high accomplishments,"
8290,SECTION XXII.,speak painful words unto me in the presence of her husband like unto an
8291,SECTION XXII.,ordinary woman. That which is above comprehension is Destiny and it is
8292,SECTION XXII.,beyond the power of creatures to avert its consequences; and evidently
8293,SECTION XXII.,it is through this Destiny that have sprung up this distemper of Kaikeyi
8294,SECTION XXII.,"and my loss of kingdom. What man dares withstand Oh son of Sumitrā, this"
8295,SECTION XXII.,(terrible) Destiny hidden from our view until known by the consequences
8296,SECTION XXII.,of action. Destiny is the prime source of those inconceivable causes
8297,SECTION XXII.,"which occur with reference to happiness misery, fear, and anger, profit"
8298,SECTION XXII.,"and loss, birth and deliverance. Seers of great austerity being"
8299,SECTION XXII.,"influenced by this Destiny, succumb to the attack of anger and desire,"
8300,SECTION XXII.,renouncing all their hard disciplines. The hinderance in this world to
8301,SECTION XXII.,"the completion of works taken in hand, and the origination of an"
8302,SECTION XXII.,"unthought of event in its stead, is nothing but the action of this"
8303,SECTION XXII.,"Destiny. The mind brought under discipline by this true rationale, there"
8304,SECTION XXII.,remains no cause of sorrow regarding my installation being put a stop
8305,SECTION XXII.,to. Do thou therefore assuage thy grief and follow me and intercept
8306,SECTION XXII.,speedily the collection of materials for my installation. The bathing
8307,SECTION XXII.,"ceremony, necessary before taking the vows of asceticism, shall be"
8308,SECTION XXII.,"performed, O Lakshmana, with all these jars full of water brought for my"
8309,SECTION XXII.,installation. Or what necessity have I with all these articles of
8310,SECTION XXII.,installation; water drawn from the well by myself shall do for entering
8311,SECTION XXII.,"into the vow of exile. Do not grieve, Oh Lakshmana, for the loss of this"
8312,SECTION XXII.,"kingdom. Of kingdom and exile into the forest, exile is fraught with"
8313,SECTION XXII.,glorious results. Knowest thou now the mighty power of Destiny and do
8314,SECTION XXII.,not blame therefore my younger mother and my father laboring under the
8315,SECTION XXII.,influence of Destiny.

8322,SECTION XXIII.,"Being addressed by Rāma thus, Lakshmana, the mighty hero, hanging down"
8323,SECTION XXIII.,"his head with half reluctance, pondered for sometime, and, placed midway"
8324,SECTION XXIII.,"between joy and grief, with frown drawn in between his brows, began to"
8325,SECTION XXIII.,"sob hot and hard, like unto an angry serpent in a cave belonging to"
8326,SECTION XXIII.,"another. No body could eye his face, having terrible frowns, which"
8327,SECTION XXIII.,looked like that of an angry lion. Moving the extremities of his hands
8328,SECTION XXIII.,"like unto the trunk of an elephant, variously altering the altitude of"
8329,SECTION XXIII.,"the neck above his frame, glancing a look awry, thus spoke he unto his"
8330,SECTION XXIII.,"brother. ""To avoid the transgression of righteousness, and the"
8331,SECTION XXIII.,"degradation of the people (consequent upon a bad example), thou art"
8332,SECTION XXIII.,eager to repair unto the forest. This thy eagerness is certainly
8333,SECTION XXIII.,"misplaced. Wast not thou under error, how could one like thyself, being"
8334,SECTION XXIII.,"heroic among the Kshatriyas, and capable of overcoming Destiny, speak in"
8335,SECTION XXIII.,such a strain as behoves one that is impotent. Why dost thou extol
8336,SECTION XXIII.,Destiny which is powerless and weak. For what reason dost thou not
8337,SECTION XXIII.,"apprehend (unrighteousness) in those two (Daçarātha and Kaikeyi),"
8338,SECTION XXIII.,addicted to vice. Dost thou not understand that there are many people
8339,SECTION XXIII.,who feign piety outwardly (to deceive the simple). With a desire to
8340,SECTION XXIII.,"renounce thee by fraud,they simulate piety which is but selfishness. Had"
8341,SECTION XXIII.,"they not purposed thus, Oh, Rāghava, things would not have taken such a"
8342,SECTION XXIII.,"turn. If this story of the vows be true, then why had it not been"
8343,SECTION XXIII.,declared before. Surely has the monarch engaged in an action hateful to
8344,SECTION XXIII.,"the people, namely the installation of a younger brother neglecting thee"
8345,SECTION XXIII.,"(the eldest one). Pray, pardon me, Oh great hero, I cannot brook all"
8346,SECTION XXIII.,"this. Even that so called virtue do I loathe, which has, O high-souled"
8347,SECTION XXIII.,"one, fascinated thee, and made thy mind run from one extreme to"
8348,SECTION XXIII.,"another.¹²⁰ Why shalt thou, being capable of work, conform these impious"
8349,SECTION XXIII.,"and cursed words of thy father, who is sadly under the influence of"
8350,SECTION XXIII.,Kaikeyi. Here lies my sorrow that thou dost not admit that this
8351,SECTION XXIII.,disturbance of the installation has arisen out of the pretext of boon
8352,SECTION XXIII.,giving; thy idea of virtue is indeed an object of censure. People will
8353,SECTION XXIII.,mark this thy forsaking of the kingdom for redeeming the vows of thy
8354,SECTION XXIII.,"father, with opprobrium. Who else, save thee, even thinks of compassing"
8355,SECTION XXIII.,"the desires of the monarch and the queen Kaikeyi, who are of"
8356,SECTION XXIII.,"unrestrained habits, ever intent on our mischief and are our enemies"
8357,SECTION XXIII.,known by the name of parents. Even if their throwing obstacles in the
8358,SECTION XXIII.,"way of thy installation thou considerest, as the inevitable action of"
8359,SECTION XXIII.,"Destiny—pray disregard it, that does not please me. He, who is"
8360,SECTION XXIII.,"tremulous, weak and powerless, follows the track of Destiny; they pay no"
8361,SECTION XXIII.,regard to it who are mighty heroes and whose prowess is held in esteem
8362,SECTION XXIII.,"by the people. He, who can avert the consequences of Destiny by dint of"
8363,SECTION XXIII.,"his manliness, does not lose heart even in the face of his interest"
8364,SECTION XXIII.,being endangered by it. People shall witness to-day the power of Destiny
8365,SECTION XXIII.,and manliness; this day shall appear which of them is more powerful.
8366,SECTION XXIII.,Those who have witnessed before the prevention of thy installation by
8367,SECTION XXIII.,"the evil agency of Destiny, shall see it defeated, even this very day,"
8368,SECTION XXIII.,by my manliness. Thwart shall I that assailing Destiny by my prowess
8369,SECTION XXIII.,"like unto a terrible elephant, freed of its shackles past the"
8370,SECTION XXIII.,restraining power of a goading hook and inflamed with the juice issuing
8371,SECTION XXIII.,"out of its temples. What of the father, not even all the protectors of"
8372,SECTION XXIII.,the regions nor the entire population of the three worlds shall be able
8373,SECTION XXIII.,to present any obstacle in the way of Rāma’s installation. Those who
8374,SECTION XXIII.,"have, with one voice, Oh king, settled about thy exile unto the forest,"
8375,SECTION XXIII.,shall be banished to day for fourteen years. Burn shall I down that hope
8376,SECTION XXIII.,of my father and Kaikeyi that they want to place Bharata on the throne
8377,SECTION XXIII.,by hindering thy installation. Influence of destiny shall not bring my
8378,SECTION XXIII.,"opponents that amount of happiness, as the misery inflicted on them by"
8379,SECTION XXIII.,my terrible prowess. Thyself retiring unto the forest after governing
8380,SECTION XXIII.,"the people for a thousand years, thy sons shall resume the"
8381,SECTION XXIII.,administration. Dwelling into the forest is permitted after making over
8382,SECTION XXIII.,"(the charge of the subjects unto (the hands of the) sons, as did the"
8383,SECTION XXIII.,"Rajarshis of old. The monarch changing his mind, the kingdom shall be"
8384,SECTION XXIII.,"transferred into another’s hands—dost thou, being afraid of this, want"
8385,SECTION XXIII.,"to fly as an exile unto the forest? And is it for this, that thou Oh"
8386,SECTION XXIII.,"virtuous souled Rāma, dost not wish to have kingdom for thee? I do"
8387,SECTION XXIII.,"promise unto thee, Oh great hero, that I shall protect thy kingdom like"
8388,SECTION XXIII.,"unto shore protecting the sea, or else I shall not attain to the region"
8389,SECTION XXIII.,of heroes. Do thou perform the rites of installation with things
8390,SECTION XXIII.,necessary for benediction—do thou engage in these affairs—myself alone
8391,SECTION XXIII.,shall be able by force to thwart the opposition of the kings. These
8392,SECTION XXIII.,hands of mine are not intended for enhancing the beauty of my body—this
8393,SECTION XXIII.,"bow is not meant for an ornament only, this sword is not for binding"
8394,SECTION XXIII.,"woods together with, and these arrows are not for carrying the weight of"
8395,SECTION XXIII.,woods—these four belonging to me are for the use of killing the enemies.
8396,SECTION XXIII.,Never do I desire that I shall not cut them into pieces with sharp edged
8397,SECTION XXIII.,"swords, brilliant as the lightning, whom I do consider as my enemies,"
8398,SECTION XXIII.,"though they be redoutable as Indra, the wielder of thunderbolt. Cover"
8399,SECTION XXIII.,thick shall I the field of battle and make it impassable by cutting
8400,SECTION XXIII.,"assunder the trunks of the elephants, thighs of the horses and heads of"
8401,SECTION XXIII.,the infantry. Being beheaded by my swords like unto the flaming fire and
8402,SECTION XXIII.,"besmeared with blood resembling the clouds with lightning, my enemies"
8403,SECTION XXIII.,"shall fall down to the ground. Who is there, proud of his own prowess,"
8404,SECTION XXIII.,that shall be able to withstand me when I shall appear at the battle
8405,SECTION XXIII.,field with bows and leathern fences of fingers. Killing one with a
8406,SECTION XXIII.,"number of arrows, and sometimes many with a single one, I shall drive"
8407,SECTION XXIII.,"shafts into the vital organs of men, horses and elephants. To-day shall"
8408,SECTION XXIII.,I display my skill in arms in destroying the supremacy of the monarch
8409,SECTION XXIII.,"and establishing thine. That hand, which is fit for the smearing of the"
8410,SECTION XXIII.,"Sandal, for wearing armlets, distributing wealth and maintaining"
8411,SECTION XXIII.,"relations, shall be engaged to-day, Oh Rāma, in performing its worthy"
8412,SECTION XXIII.,action—the discomfiture of them who want to throw obstacles in the way
8413,SECTION XXIII.,"of thy installation. Pray tell me now, which of your enemies shall be"
8414,SECTION XXIII.,"cut off by me from wealth, life and relatives? I am thy servant: do thou"
8415,SECTION XXIII.,give me instruction that the whole earth may be brought under thy
8416,SECTION XXIII.,"subjection"". That descendant of Raghu, wiping tears off the eyes of"
8417,SECTION XXIII.,"Lakshmana and consoling him repeatedly, spoke unto him saying ""Oh gentle"

8437,SECTION XXIV.,"highly accomplished descendant of Kākuthstha, favourite of the king, is"
8438,SECTION XXIV.,"going to be exiled? Certainly Destiny, who crowns or afflicts people"
8439,SECTION XXIV.,"with happiness or misery, is the most powerful agency in the world, or"
8440,SECTION XXIV.,"why shalt thou, Oh pleasing Rāma, fly as an exile unto the forest? This"

8442,SECTION XXIV.,"the wind of thy absence, increased by the fuels of lamentation and pain,"
8443,SECTION XXIV.,"kindled by hard sobs, obtaining the oblations of tears, vomiting the"
8444,SECTION XXIV.,smoke of vapour begotten of anxious thoughts—the result of counting upon
8445,SECTION XXIV.,"the days of thy return, shall consume me, making greatly lean, when"
8446,SECTION XXIV.,"deprived of thy presence, as does the fire burn the dry grass in summer."
8447,SECTION XXIV.,"Like unto a cow following its young one shall I follow thee, Oh my"
8448,SECTION XXIV.,"darling, wherever shalt thou go."" Hearing those words of his mother,"
8449,SECTION XXIV.,"Rāma that best of men, spoke the following words unto her, who was"
8450,SECTION XXIV.,"greatly troubled with sorrow. ""The monarch has been duped by Kaikeyi;"
8451,SECTION XXIV.,"myself resorting to the forest, surely shall he resign his life, if cast"
8452,SECTION XXIV.,off again by thee. There is nothing more cruel for women than the
8453,SECTION XXIV.,"forsaking of their husbands; it does not behove thee therefore, to think"
8454,SECTION XXIV.,even of this opprobrious action. Do thou serve this descendant of
8455,SECTION XXIV.,"Kākuthstha, my father, and the lord of the earth as long as he"
8456,SECTION XXIV.,"lives—know thou this to be the eternal virtue."""
8457,SECTION XXIV.,
8458,SECTION XXIV.,"Thus addressed by Rāma, Kauçalya of auspicious looks, being gratified"
8459,SECTION XXIV.,"greatly; spoke unto him, the remover of her sorrows. ""Truly it is."""
8460,SECTION XXIV.,"Rāma, the foremost amongst religious men, being spoken thus, said to his"

8462,SECTION XXIV.,"strain. ""Proper it is both for thee and me to carry out father’s words:"
8463,SECTION XXIV.,"he is thy husband, and my best preceptor and the lord and master of all"

8467,SECTION XXIV.,"her eyes full of tears, spoke unto her beloved son the following words."
8468,SECTION XXIV.,"""Oh Rāma, I shall not be able to live amongst these co-wives, if art"
8469,SECTION XXIV.,thou resolved to go to the forest for the discharge of thy father’s
8470,SECTION XXIV.,"behest; do thou take me with thee, Oh Kākuthstha, like unto a wild hind."
8471,SECTION XXIV.,"Rāma, supressing his feeling, spoke unto his mother who was lamenting,"
8472,SECTION XXIV.,"thus, saying:—""Husband is the deity and master of the wife as long as"
8473,SECTION XXIV.,she lives; so the monarch being the lord can deal with thee and me in
8474,SECTION XXIV.,"any way he likes. That highly intelligent lord of men living, we should"
8475,SECTION XXIV.,not consider ourselves as without a master. Bharata is also pious and
8476,SECTION XXIV.,"beloved of all people in speech—he, intent on the performance of"

8479,SECTION XXIV.,"separation, that this terrible sorrow may not kill him. Do thou look"

8481,SECTION XXIV.,"husband being engaged in excellent religious rites and fasts, shall fare"
8482,SECTION XXIV.,wretchedly in the life to come; and a woman gets at the excellent abode
8483,SECTION XXIV.,of the celestials by serving her husband. Even those who do not worship
8484,SECTION XXIV.,and bow unto the celestial’s should serve their husbands alone being
8485,SECTION XXIV.,intent upon their welfare Such is the virtue that should be always
8486,SECTION XXIV.,pursued by women according to the _Vedas_ and _Smritis_. Do thou beguile
8487,SECTION XXIV.,"thy time, Oh worshipful one, expecting my return, by worshipping the"
8488,SECTION XXIV.,celestials with flowers and oblations unto the fire and serving well the
8489,SECTION XXIV.,Brahmins. Engaged in discipline and fasting and devoted to the services
8490,SECTION XXIV.,"of thy husband thou shalt attain thy best desire, on my return, if this"

8659,SECTION XXVI.,the approach of Rāma with a grateful and pleased heart. Entered Rāma

8669,SECTION XXVI.,"—and planet Vrihaspati is presiding over this conjunction, this day has"

8672,SECTION XXVI.,"face been placed under the shade of an umbrella, having hundred ribs and"
8673,SECTION XXVI.,"white as a watery foam? Why do not the servants fan thee, having eyes"
8674,SECTION XXVI.,"like lotus’ petals, with chowries white as the moon or a goose? I do not"
8675,SECTION XXVI.,"see thee, Oh best of men, eulogised with auspicious songs by the"

8690,SECTION XXVI.,"family, versed in the knowledge of religion and intent on the"
8691,SECTION XXVI.,"performance of religious rites, my father has banished me unto the"
8692,SECTION XXVI.,"forest! Do thou hear, Oh daughter of Janaka, how has this calamity"
8693,SECTION XXVI.,"befallen me. In the days of yore was granted unto my mother, Kaikeyi two"
8694,SECTION XXVI.,"boons by my father, king Daçarātha of truthful vows. When every thing"
8695,SECTION XXVI.,"was made ready by my father for my installation, Kaikeyi reminded him of"
8696,SECTION XXVI.,his promise and gained over him for his righteousness. I shall live in
8697,SECTION XXVI.,the forest of Dandaka for fourteen years and Bharata shall be installed
8698,SECTION XXVI.,by my father as the heir apparent of the throne. And myself bound to fly
8699,SECTION XXVI.,"as an exile unto the wood, come here to see thee; do thou not praise me"
8700,SECTION XXVI.,ever before Bharata. Those who are crowned with prosperity cannot bear
8701,SECTION XXVI.,another’s praise; it therefore behoves thee not to extol my virtues in
8702,SECTION XXVI.,the presence of Bharata. Thou shouldst not extol me even in the company
8703,SECTION XXVI.,of thy friends; thou shalt be then able to live with Bharata as one
8704,SECTION XXVI.,favourable to his party. The monarch has granted him this lasting heir
8705,SECTION XXVI.,"apparentship; it is therefore proper for thee, Oh Sitā, to please him"
8706,SECTION XXVI.,specially for he is the king now. To day shall I repair unto the forest
8707,SECTION XXVI.,"for redeeming my father’s vows; do thou, Oh high-minded one, live here"
8708,SECTION XXVI.,"in undisturbed mind. Do thou, Oh sinless and auspicious one, live here"
8709,SECTION XXVI.,"engaged in religious rites and fasts, when I shall wend my way unto the"
8710,SECTION XXVI.,forest inhabited by the great ascetics. Rising from the bed early in the
8711,SECTION XXVI.,"morning, adore the deities every day, and then bow down unto the feet of"
8712,SECTION XXVI.,"my father Daçarātha, the lord of men. My mother Kauçalyā is old and much"
8713,SECTION XXVI.,"pressed down with sorrow; do thou show proper respects unto her,"
8714,SECTION XXVI.,considering it to be a pious deed. Thou shouldst then bow down unto my
8715,SECTION XXVI.,"other mothers who all minister unto me, with equal love and affection."
8716,SECTION XXVI.,Shouldst thou specially regard Bharata and Satrugna like unto thy sons
8717,SECTION XXVI.,"or brothers, who are dearer unto me than my life itself. Thou shouldst"
8718,SECTION XXVI.,"not do, Oh Vaidehi, any such thing as might be unpleasant unto Bharata,"
8719,SECTION XXVI.,for he is the king of the land as well as of the family.
8720,SECTION XXVI.,
8721,SECTION XXVI.,The monarchs are always propitiated by being served with assiduity and
8722,SECTION XXVI.,good temper; they are offended when any thing contrary to it happens.

8724,SECTION XXVI.,"him bringing about their mischief, and admit into their favour persons"
8725,SECTION XXVI.,devoted to their welfare bearing no relationship whatever. It therefore
8726,SECTION XXVI.,"behoves thee, Oh auspicious one, to live here, abiding by Bharata’s"
8727,SECTION XXVI.,commands and being engaged in religious rites and truthful vows. I am
8728,SECTION XXVI.,"going unto the forest, Oh my darling, and thou shalt live here. Oh"
8729,SECTION XXVI.,"excellent lady, abide by my word as didst thou never formerly falsify"

8739,SECTION XXVII.,"great affection. ""Is it that thou speakest me thus, thinking me, no"
8740,SECTION XXVII.,"doubt, mean minded? I can not but laugh at thy words, Oh best of men;"
8741,SECTION XXVII.,what thou hast said is not becoming of a mighty prince versed in
8742,SECTION XXVII.,"military arts and is really very opprobrious and infamous. What more, it"
8743,SECTION XXVII.,"is not proper even to hear them. Oh dear husband, father, mother, son,"
8744,SECTION XXVII.,"brother, daugther-in-law, all of them abide by the consequences of their"
8745,SECTION XXVII.,"own actions, it is the wife alone, Oh best of men, that shares the fate"
8746,SECTION XXVII.,of her husband; it therefore that ever along with thee I have been
8747,SECTION XXVII.,"ordered to live in the forest. Neither father, mother, son, friends, nor"
8748,SECTION XXVII.,"her ownself is the stay of a woman in this or in after life, it is the"
8749,SECTION XXVII.,husband alone that is her only support. If dost thou repair to-day unto
8750,SECTION XXVII.,"the forest impregnable, I shall go before thee, Oh Rāghava, treading"
8751,SECTION XXVII.,"upon the thorns and prickly grass. Confident do thou take me with thee,"
8752,SECTION XXVII.,"Oh great hero, renouncing jealousy and indignation, like unto water left"
8753,SECTION XXVII.,after drinking; there exists no sin in me that could justify forsaking.
8754,SECTION XXVII.,Unto woman is preferable under all circumtances the shade of her

8757,SECTION XXVII.,follow my husband in all conditions of life; and I shall carry out now

8759,SECTION XXVII.,"wend my way unto the forest impassable, devoid of men. inhabited by"

8761,SECTION XXVII.,"there as if in my paternal house, giving no thought upon the prosperity"
8762,SECTION XXVII.,"of the three worlds, thinking only of the services that are to be"
8763,SECTION XXVII.,"rendered unto my husband. I shall sport with thee, Oh great hero, in"
8764,SECTION XXVII.,"that forest impregnated with the fragrance of flowers, tending thee"
8765,SECTION XXVII.,"constantly, having my senses subdued, and being engaged in austere"
8766,SECTION XXVII.,"performances. Oh great hero, capable art thou to maintain many thousand"
8767,SECTION XXVII.,"others in the forest, what of me. Surely shall I go to-day to the forest"
8768,SECTION XXVII.,"with thee; there is no doubt about it and thou shalt not be able, Oh"
8769,SECTION XXVII.,"great hero, to dissuade me from so doing. Undoubtedly I shall always"
8770,SECTION XXVII.,live upon roots and fruits; living with thee always I shall not bring
8771,SECTION XXVII.,"about thy affliction. Always I shall precede thee when walking, and"
8772,SECTION XXVII.,shall take my repast after thou hast taken it. Willing am I to view
8773,SECTION XXVII.,"mountains, rivulets, lakes and ponds. Being fearless in thy company, Oh"
8774,SECTION XXVII.,"my intelligent husband and great hero, I shall behold on all sides ponds"
8775,SECTION XXVII.,filled with wild geese and ducks and beautified with a collection of
8776,SECTION XXVII.,"fullblown lotuses, and shall bathe there every day, pursuing the same"
8777,SECTION XXVII.,"vow with thee. And greatly gratified, I shall, Oh thou having expansive"
8778,SECTION XXVII.,"eyes, amuse there with thee, in this manner, even for hundred or"
8779,SECTION XXVII.,"thousand years. I shall never experience the reverse of fortune,"
8780,SECTION XXVII.,"inasmuch as I do not like to live in the abode of celestials, Oh"
8781,SECTION XXVII.,"Rāghava, if I am to dwell there without thee; no, it is not pleasing"

8803,SECTION XXVIII.,"spoken thus. And consoling her whose eyes were stained with tears, that"
8804,SECTION XXVIII.,virtuous-souled one spoke unto her the following words with a view to
8805,SECTION XXVIII.,"prevent her from going. ""Oh Sitā, thou art born of an illustrious family"
8806,SECTION XXVIII.,and ever intent on the performance of religious deeds; do thou practise
8807,SECTION XXVIII.,"virtue here as it may conduce to the happiness of my mind. Oh Sitā, Oh"
8808,SECTION XXVIII.,"thou of the weaker sex, do thou act up to my counsels; there are evils"
8809,SECTION XXVIII.,"enough in the forest, do thou learn them from me who am about to dwell"
8810,SECTION XXVIII.,"in it. Renounce therefore. Oh Sitā, thy intention of flying as an exile"
8811,SECTION XXVIII.,"unto the forest, which for its impenitrableness is said to abound in"
8812,SECTION XXVIII.,evils. It is for thy welfare that I give utterance to these words;
8813,SECTION XXVIII.,"happiness there is none, it is always covered with miseries. The"
8814,SECTION XXVIII.,"roarings of the lions living in the caves of mountains, swelling with"
8815,SECTION XXVIII.,"the sounds of the waterfalls, produce a very painful impression upon the"
8816,SECTION XXVIII.,"ears; so the wood is full of misery. Animals, all maddened, sporting in"
8817,SECTION XXVIII.,"solitude, seeing (man), approach to attack him; so the wood is full of"
8818,SECTION XXVIII.,"misery. The rivers are full of crocodiles, sharks, and other fearful"
8819,SECTION XXVIII.,"animals, muddy and impassable and always infested with infuriated"
8820,SECTION XXVIII.,elephants; the wood is full of misery. There the wayfares are covered
8821,SECTION XXVIII.,with creepers and thorns: they are void of drinking water and ever
8822,SECTION XXVIII.,resounded with the noise of the wild fowls; so the wood is full of
8823,SECTION XXVIII.,"misery. Being exhausted with the toil of the day, the dwellers of the"
8824,SECTION XXVIII.,wood have to sleep in night on the bed made of leaves fallen from the
8825,SECTION XXVIII.,trees on the surface of the ground; so the wood is full of misery. With
8826,SECTION XXVIII.,the (supply of) fruits that have fallen from the trees man of self
8827,SECTION XXVIII.,"discipline must content himself morning and evening; so the wood, O"
8828,SECTION XXVIII.,"Sitā, is full of misery. One has to fast, O Maithili, according to his"
8829,SECTION XXVIII.,"might, to wear matted hair and bark, to adore the deities and his"
8830,SECTION XXVIII.,"ancestors according to due rites, every day to serve the guests that"
8831,SECTION XXVIII.,"come to him, and observing the rules of asceticism, to bathe every day"
8832,SECTION XXVIII.,"thrice, namely, in the morning, in the mid-day and in the evening; so"
8833,SECTION XXVIII.,the wood is full of misery. One has to offer presents of flowers
8834,SECTION XXVIII.,"collected by his ownself unto the altars, O Sitā, according to the rites"
8835,SECTION XXVIII.,of the ascetics; so the wood is full of misery. Those that dwell in the
8836,SECTION XXVIII.,"forest will have to remain content, having practised moderation in food,"
8837,SECTION XXVIII.,"O Maithili, with whatever edibles are attainable in the forest; so the"
8838,SECTION XXVIII.,"wood is full of misery. There are always violent winds, darkness,"
8839,SECTION XXVIII.,"hunger, and great fear; so the wood is full of misery. Reptiles, many"
8840,SECTION XXVIII.,"and of various kinds, creep there on the path, O excellent lady, with"
8841,SECTION XXVIII.,haughtiness; so the wood is full of misery. And snakes living in the
8842,SECTION XXVIII.,"rivers and of crooked course like them, always await the wayfarers,"
8843,SECTION XXVIII.,"hindering the passers-by: so the wood is full of misery. Birds,"
8844,SECTION XXVIII.,"scorpions, insects mosquitos and wild gnats, always disturb the"
8845,SECTION XXVIII.,"dwellers, O fair one of the weaker sex; so the wood is full of misery."
8846,SECTION XXVIII.,"There are trees full of thorns, having their branches moving to and fro,"
8847,SECTION XXVIII.,and the _kusa_ and _kāsa_ grasses with thorny blades constantly
8848,SECTION XXVIII.,undulating; so the wood is full of misery. There are various physical
8849,SECTION XXVIII.,afflictions and divers fears and great misery consequent upon living in
8850,SECTION XXVIII.,"the forest. Anger and desires are to be renounced, the heart is to be"
8851,SECTION XXVIII.,"set on ascetic austerities, fear in the fearful objects is to be cast"
8852,SECTION XXVIII.,off; so the wood is full of misery. Thou shouldst not therefore go unto
8853,SECTION XXVIII.,"the forest—it forebodes no good unto thee. Weighing well, have I"
8854,SECTION XXVIII.,"concluded that the forest abounds in innumerable evils."" While the"
8855,SECTION XXVIII.,"high-souled Rāma, resolved thus not to take Sitā with him unto the"
8856,SECTION XXVIII.,"forest, she, greatly sorry, did not accept his words and spoke unto him"
8857,SECTION XXVIII.,in the following way.

8867,SECTION XXIX.,"qualities unto me, who have been made forward by thy affection. Deer,"
8868,SECTION XXIX.,"lions, elephants, tigers, _saravas_,¹³² _chamaras_,¹³³ _srimaras_,¹³⁴"
8869,SECTION XXIX.,"and other animals which have not seen thee before, seeing thee, Rāghava,"
8870,SECTION XXIX.,"will stand off, for they all fear thee. I shall follow thee, taking the"
8871,SECTION XXIX.,"permission of the respected ones; without thee, O Rāma, I will renounce"
8872,SECTION XXIX.,"my life. If I live by thee, O Rāghava, _Sakra_, the lord of celestials,"
8873,SECTION XXIX.,"shall not be able with his mighty power to defeat me. ’A woman, without"
8874,SECTION XXIX.,"her husband, cannot live’; this truth has been pointed out by thee, O"
8875,SECTION XXIX.,"Rāma, unto me. Besides, I heard before, thou of great intelligence, in"
8876,SECTION XXIX.,my paternal house from the Brāhmanas that I should live in the forest. I
8877,SECTION XXIX.,"have heard this from the Brāhmanas versed in palmistry, and I have all"
8878,SECTION XXIX.,"along been anxious, O mighty hero, to go to the forest; shall therefore"
8879,SECTION XXIX.,"obtain permission and go, O dearly beloved, unto the forest with thee;"
8880,SECTION XXIX.,nothing can make it otherwise. I shall secure permission and follow
8881,SECTION XXIX.,thee; the time has arrived; may the Brāhmanas be of truthful words! I
8882,SECTION XXIX.,"know, O great hero, that there are many evils incident to living in the"
8883,SECTION XXIX.,forest; but they generally befall those men who have not their senses
8884,SECTION XXIX.,"subdued. I heard, when I was a girl, that an ascetic woman of"
8885,SECTION XXIX.,"well-disciplined character, came to my mother and apprised her of my"
8886,SECTION XXIX.,"future abode in the forest. I had requested thee, O my lord, many times"
8887,SECTION XXIX.,"before in this house to take me to the forest with thee for enjoyment,"
8888,SECTION XXIX.,"and thou wast pleased to agree. For thy welfare, O Rāghava, having"
8889,SECTION XXIX.,"received thy permission to follow thee, I like to serve thee, O great"
8890,SECTION XXIX.,"hero, while living in the forest."
8891,SECTION XXIX.,
8892,SECTION XXIX.,"O thou, pure-hearted one, surely shall I become sinless if I follow my"
8893,SECTION XXIX.,"husband,out of affection; for my husband is my Divinity. I have heard"
8894,SECTION XXIX.,this pious report from the Brāhmanas of great fame that even in after
8895,SECTION XXIX.,"life thy company is greatly beneficial unto me. She, who has been given"
8896,SECTION XXIX.,"away as wife by her father to one, with due rites of gift peculiar to"
8897,SECTION XXIX.,"each class, touching holy water, shall be his, even in her after life."
8898,SECTION XXIX.,For what reason then dost thou not wish to take thy wife with thee who
8899,SECTION XXIX.,"is of good character and devoted to her husband? Do thou take me, O"
8900,SECTION XXIX.,"Kākuthstha, who am poor in spirit, devoted to my husband, ever given to"
8901,SECTION XXIX.,"thy service, and participating equally in thy joy and sorrow. If thou"
8902,SECTION XXIX.,"dost not purpose to take me with thee, surely will I do away with my"
8903,SECTION XXIX.,"life by drinking poison, entering into fire, or drowning myself in"
8904,SECTION XXIX.,"water."" She begged Rāma in these and various other means to take her"
8905,SECTION XXIX.,"with him, but that mighty hero did not consent to lead her into the"
8906,SECTION XXIX.,"lonely forest. Being accosted thus, Maithili was wrapt up in thought and"
8907,SECTION XXIX.,bathed her breast with tears trickling down from her eyes. And
8908,SECTION XXIX.,"Kākuthstha having control over his ownself, with a view to dissuade her"
8909,SECTION XXIX.,"who was angry and engrossed in anxious thoughts, began to console her in"

8931,SECTION XXX.,that the sun has not that burning flood of light which in Rāma does
8932,SECTION XXX.,"shine forth, woe is them, it is falsehood. Why art thou so dejected and"
8933,SECTION XXX.,whence is thy fear that thou art willing to leave behind thy wife who
8934,SECTION XXX.,has none else but thee? Know me to be perfectly under thy influence like
8935,SECTION XXX.,"unto _Sāvitri_, following her husband _Satvavān_, the son of _Dumat"
8936,SECTION XXX.,"Sen_. I have not, like one bringing stigma on her line, ever in my life"
8937,SECTION XXX.,"thought of a second person, but of thee whom I must follow into the"
8938,SECTION XXX.,"forest. Dost thou, like unto an ordinary actor, wish to hand me over to"
8939,SECTION XXX.,"others, who am chaste, pure as a virgin, and long held in conjugal"
8940,SECTION XXX.,"affection? O sinless one, do thou become subservient and serviceable to"
8941,SECTION XXX.,"him whose pleasure thou biddst me seek, and for whom thou hast suffered"
8942,SECTION XXX.,thyself to be impeded (in the installation). It does not behove thee to
8943,SECTION XXX.,repair unto the forest without taking me along with thee. Be it the
8944,SECTION XXX.,"austerity of an ascetic, the forest or heaven, with thee will I be"
8945,SECTION XXX.,"everywhere. No toil shall I suffer on the way, as if lying on a bed of"
8946,SECTION XXX.,"luxury, while following thee in thy footstep. When with thee, the"
8947,SECTION XXX.,"various thorny grasses, the _Kusa_, the _Kāsa_, the _Sara_, and the"
8948,SECTION XXX.,"_Ishika_, and the thistles and brambles on the way, shall be unto me in"
8949,SECTION XXX.,"touch like unto linen and deer-skin. The dust that will cover me, thrown"
8950,SECTION XXX.,"up by the gush of wind, shall be, O ravisher of my heart, regarded by me"
8951,SECTION XXX.,as the finest sandal dust. When I shall lie down on the bed of green
8952,SECTION XXX.,"grass in the forest, it shall appear to me more pleasant than one"
8953,SECTION XXX.,"covered with a colored blanket. Fruits, roots and leaves which thou wilt"
8954,SECTION XXX.,"bring thyself and give me, be they great or small in quantity, shall be"
8955,SECTION XXX.,"to me like unto the ambrosia-juice. I shall never think of my father,"
8956,SECTION XXX.,"mother, or my abode; I shall enjoy fruits and flowers growing in various"
8957,SECTION XXX.,seasons. Thou shalt not witness any thing disagreeable there; for me
8958,SECTION XXX.,"thou shalt not experience any sorrow,nor shall I be a burden unto thee;"
8959,SECTION XXX.,"do thou take me with thee, O Rāma, conceiving with pleasure that thy"
8960,SECTION XXX.,company is a heaven unto me and thy absence a hell. If thou dost not
8961,SECTION XXX.,"take me unto the forest which I count freed from all evils, surely I"
8962,SECTION XXX.,shall drink poison and never come under the influence of my enemies.
8963,SECTION XXX.,"When through affliction I shall not live after separation, better it is,"
8964,SECTION XXX.,"O Lord, that I die immediately at the time of my being forsaken by thee;"
8965,SECTION XXX.,I cannot bear this grief even for a moment. How shall I be able to live
8966,SECTION XXX.,"without thee for fourteen years?"""
8967,SECTION XXX.,
8968,SECTION XXX.,"Thus lamenting, Sitā, racked with sorrow, embraced her husband and began"
8969,SECTION XXX.,"to cry aloud. Like unto a she- elephant,she being pierced by the"
8970,SECTION XXX.,"poisonous shafts of Rāma’s words, began to shed tears, long kept off, as"
8971,SECTION XXX.,an _Arani_ wood emits fire continually. Tears caused by her sorrow and
8972,SECTION XXX.,"white as the crystal began to trickle down from her eyes, like unto"
8973,SECTION XXX.,water falling in drops from lotus petals. And that beautiful face having
8974,SECTION XXX.,"expansive eyes and resembling the full moon in its splendour, with tears"
8975,SECTION XXX.,"became pale and parched, like unto a lotus taken out of its watery bed."
8976,SECTION XXX.,"Finding her almost insensible with sorrow, Rāma flung his arms round her"
8977,SECTION XXX.,and reviving her (with consolation) spoke the following words unto her;
8978,SECTION XXX.,"""I do not long for, O worshipful one, even the abode of celestials"
8979,SECTION XXX.,gained through thy affliction: fear there is none for me like unto the
8980,SECTION XXX.,"self-create Brahmā. Not apprised of thy full intention, O thou of"
8981,SECTION XXX.,"beautiful countenance, I could not, though capable of escorting thee,"
8982,SECTION XXX.,"desire thy abode in the forest. When thou art determined O Maithili, to"
8983,SECTION XXX.,"repair unto the forest with me, I cannot leave thee behind, as one"
8984,SECTION XXX.,"possessing self knowledge cannot renounce munificence. O thou, having"
8985,SECTION XXX.,"thighs resembling the trunks of an elephant, I shall resort to that"
8986,SECTION XXX.,virtue which was exercised by great and good men going before; do thou
8987,SECTION XXX.,follow me therefore like Suvarchalā following the Sun. I cannot but go
8988,SECTION XXX.,"unto the forest, O daughter of Janaka, the truthful word of my father"
8989,SECTION XXX.,leads me thereto. Obedience unto his parents is the virtue of a son.
8990,SECTION XXX.,Disobeying the command of my father I am not eager to live. Why should
8991,SECTION XXX.,"we with meditations and adorations worship Destiny, which is not"
8992,SECTION XXX.,"cognizable to the worshippers, neglecting our parents, who are ever"
8993,SECTION XXX.,present to our senses? In the worship of the parents are fulfilled the
8994,SECTION XXX.,"triple object of religious pursuit, and the adoration of the three"
8995,SECTION XXX.,"regions; there is nothing equal to it, conducing to purity; so do I, O"
8996,SECTION XXX.,"thou of excellent look, resort to it."
8997,SECTION XXX.,
8998,SECTION XXX.,"Truth, almsgiving, honor, and sacrifices with profuse gifts are not so"
8999,SECTION XXX.,strengthening (in the life to come) as the services rendered unlo the
9000,SECTION XXX.,"parents. Heaven, wealth, grains, learning, son, and happiness,—nothing"
9001,SECTION XXX.,"remains inaccessible unto us. Great souls following the desires, and"
9002,SECTION XXX.,"resorting to the service of their parents, get at the abodes of"
9003,SECTION XXX.,"celestials, Gandharvas, the seats of Brahmā and Vishnu, and other"
9004,SECTION XXX.,excellent regions. Therefore do I desire to follow what my father
9005,SECTION XXX.,"commands me, treading in the path of truth,— and this is the virtue"
9006,SECTION XXX.,"eternal. My resolution of not taking thee, Sitā, unto the forest of"
9007,SECTION XXX.,"Dandaka is now rent asunder, as thou hast prepared thyself to live in"
9008,SECTION XXX.,"the forest and follow me. Permitted by me, O fair one of exquisite"
9009,SECTION XXX.,"beauty, to repair unto the forest, do thou follow me, O thou timid one,"
9010,SECTION XXX.,"and the partner of my righteousness. Thy determination to follow me, O"
9011,SECTION XXX.,"beautiful one, is very excellent and is in perfect keeping with myself"
9012,SECTION XXX.,"and my family. Do thou address thyself to repairing unto the forest, for"
9013,SECTION XXX.,without this now even heaven itself does not please me. Do thou give
9014,SECTION XXX.,away jewels unto the Brāhmanas and edibles unto the beggars longing for
9015,SECTION XXX.,"them, and make haste without delay. Confer upon the Brāhmanas, valuable"
9016,SECTION XXX.,"ornaments, excellent clothes, pleasant toys, beds, conveyances and other"
9017,SECTION XXX.,fine things in thy possession and then what remains do thou distribute
9018,SECTION XXX.,"amongst the servants."" Convinced that her going to the forest was"
9019,SECTION XXX.,"desired by her husband, Sitā began to distribute them speedily with a"
9020,SECTION XXX.,delighted heart.

9024,SECTION XXXI.,SECTION XXXI.
9025,SECTION XXXI.,
9026,SECTION XXXI.,
9027,SECTION XXXI.,"Hearing this conversation, Lakshmana, who had gone there before, with"
9028,SECTION XXXI.,"tears in his eyes and being unable to bear this terrible sorrow, took"
9029,SECTION XXXI.,hold of his brother’s feet and spoke thus unto that greatly renowned
9030,SECTION XXXI.,"Sitā and Rāghava. ""If thou art resolved to repair unto the forest filled"
9031,SECTION XXXI.,"with deer and elephants, I shall accompany thee, always going before"
9032,SECTION XXXI.,with bows in my hands. Thou shalt range with me in that charming part of
9033,SECTION XXXI.,the forest which resounds with the music of the birds and the humming of
9034,SECTION XXXI.,the bees. Alienated from thee I do not long for the abode of the
9035,SECTION XXXI.,"celestials, nor for eternal life, nor for the wealth of the three"
9036,SECTION XXXI.,"regions."" The son of Sumitrā, who spoke thus and was determined upon"
9037,SECTION XXXI.,"going to the forest, being repeatedly requested by Rāma with consoling"
9038,SECTION XXXI.,"words to desist from his purpose, spoke unto him the following words."
9039,SECTION XXXI.,"""Formerly thou didst order me to follow thee; and why dost thou prevent"
9040,SECTION XXXI.,"me now from accompanying thee to the forest? I want to learn, O sinless"
9041,SECTION XXXI.,"one, why thou dost prevent me now from following thee. I entertain a"
9042,SECTION XXXI.,"grave doubt in this."" Then the highly effulgent Rāma spoke thus unto"
9043,SECTION XXXI.,"that sedate Lakshmana, who stood praying before him with clasped hands."
9044,SECTION XXXI.,"""Thou art sedate, fond of virtue, of peaceful temper, and thou walkest"
9045,SECTION XXXI.,always in the paths of righteousness. I hold thee dear as my life and
9046,SECTION XXXI.,thou art obedient unto me and art my friend. If thou dost accompany me
9047,SECTION XXXI.,"unto the forest, O son of Sumitrā, who shall serve Kauçalyā and the"
9048,SECTION XXXI.,highly renowned Sumitrā? That highly effulgent lord of earth who will
9049,SECTION XXXI.,satisfy the world with the fulfillment of its desires like unto rain
9050,SECTION XXXI.,"spreading in showers over the earth, is himself now shackled with"
9051,SECTION XXXI.,desires unto Kaikeyi. That daughter of Açwapati obtaining this kingdom
9052,SECTION XXXI.,"from the monarch, there will be no end of the miseries of these"
9053,SECTION XXXI.,"co-wives. Bharata attaining the throne and siding his mother, Kaikeyi"
9054,SECTION XXXI.,will never think of Kauçalyā or Sumitrā sore distressed with grief. Do
9055,SECTION XXXI.,"thou therefore, O son of Sumitrā, live here of thy own accord or by the"
9056,SECTION XXXI.,"favour of the monarch, and maintain these worshipful ones. If thou dost"
9057,SECTION XXXI.,"act thus, it will be showing thy best regard in me. O thou, versed in"
9058,SECTION XXXI.,"the knowledge of religion, real virtue consists in the adoration of"
9059,SECTION XXXI.,"superiors. Do this, O son of Sumitrā, for my sake; if we all go away"
9060,SECTION XXXI.,"leaving her aside, she will not be happy in any way."""
9061,SECTION XXXI.,
9062,SECTION XXXI.,"Accosted thus by Rāma, Lakshmana, well versed in speech, spoke unto him"
9063,SECTION XXXI.,"the following humble words. ""Be afraid of thy power, O hero, Bharata"
9064,SECTION XXXI.,shall adore Kauçalyā and Sumitrā—there is no doubt about this. If that
9065,SECTION XXXI.,"wicked Bharata obtaining this excellent kingdom, does not maintain and"
9066,SECTION XXXI.,"take care of them, being impelled by haughtiness and wicked impulses,"
9067,SECTION XXXI.,"surely shall I kill him, that wicked-minded one, though he be assisted"
9068,SECTION XXXI.,"by the entire population of the three regions. Besides, that worshipful"
9069,SECTION XXXI.,"Kauçalyā, who has made grants of many thousand villages unto her"
9070,SECTION XXXI.,"servants, can maintain thousands of people like us, and has enough to"
9071,SECTION XXXI.,maintain herself as well as my mother. Do thou therefore permit me to
9072,SECTION XXXI.,"follow thee; there will be no breach of virtue in this,and I shall have"
9073,SECTION XXXI.,my desires attained and thy interests shall be secured. I shall go
9074,SECTION XXXI.,"before thee pointing out thy course, with stringed bows, a hoe, and a"
9075,SECTION XXXI.,basket in my hands. I shall bring for thee every day various roots and
9076,SECTION XXXI.,fruits and other things that grow in the forest and which the ascetics
9077,SECTION XXXI.,use in their sacrifice. Thou shalt amuse thyself with Vaidehi on the
9078,SECTION XXXI.,"sides of the hill, and I shall perform everything for thee whether thou"
9079,SECTION XXXI.,"art asleep or awake."""
9080,SECTION XXXI.,
9081,SECTION XXXI.,"Being extremely gratified with these words, Rāma spoke unto him,"
9082,SECTION XXXI.,"saying,—""Do thou follow me, O son of Sumitrā, obtaining permission from"
9083,SECTION XXXI.,all thy relatives. The high-souled Varuna himself offered two
9084,SECTION XXXI.,"terrible-looking bows of etherial temper, two sets of weapons at the"
9085,SECTION XXXI.,"great sacrifice of the royal Janaka—namely, impenetrable mail, two"
9086,SECTION XXXI.,"quivers, two inexhaustible arrows, and two swords burnished with gold"
9087,SECTION XXXI.,and bright as the Sun. These things were offered unto me as bridal
9088,SECTION XXXI.,"presents, and I have kept them at the house of my preceptor. Do thou, O"
9089,SECTION XXXI.,"Lakshmana, paying homage unto my preceptor, taking all those weapons,"
9090,SECTION XXXI.,"swiftly bring them hither. Determined upon going unto the forest,"
9091,SECTION XXXI.,"Lakshmana, taking leave of his friends, went to the abode of the"
9092,SECTION XXXI.,spiritual preceptor of the Ikshwākus and took from him those excellent
9093,SECTION XXXI.,"weapons. And that best of princes, the son of Sumitrā, showed Rāma those"
9094,SECTION XXXI.,heavenly arms—worshipped and well adorned with garlands. Seeing
9095,SECTION XXXI.,"Lakshmana arrive there, Rāma, having control over his ownself, greatly"
9096,SECTION XXXI.,"pleased, spoke unto him the following words. ""Thou hast arrived, O"
9097,SECTION XXXI.,"Lakshmana, just when I wanted thee. I want to distribute with thee these"
9098,SECTION XXXI.,my riches amongst the Brāhmauas and the ascetics. There are many
9099,SECTION XXXI.,excellent Brāhmanas having firm reverence in their preceptor. I want to
9100,SECTION XXXI.,distribute my wealth amongst them and many other personages who depend
9101,SECTION XXXI.,upon me for their maintenance. Bring here speedily the worshipful
9102,SECTION XXXI.,"Sujajna, the son of Vasishtha; I want to repair unto the forest after"
9103,SECTION XXXI.,"duly adoring him and other excellent Brāhmanas."""

9108,SECTION XXXII.,
9109,SECTION XXXII.,
9110,SECTION XXXII.,"Receiving this pleasant and beneficial mandate of his brother, Lakshmana"
9111,SECTION XXXII.,"speedily went unto the abode of Sujajna, and finding that Vipra in the"
9112,SECTION XXXII.,"chamber where the sacrificial fire was maintained, worshipped him and"
9113,SECTION XXXII.,"addressed him, saying; ""Friend, come and behold the abode of that one of"
9114,SECTION XXXII.,"arduous deeds (Rāma) renouncing his incoming installation."" Finishing"
9115,SECTION XXXII.,"his prayers, Sujajna accompanied Lakshmana and arrived at the splendid"
9116,SECTION XXXII.,"mansion of Rāma, filled with riches. No sooner Rāma found that Brāhmana"
9117,SECTION XXXII.,"versed in the Veda (Sujajna) arrive there, shining in effulgence like"
9118,SECTION XXXII.,"unto the blazing fire, than he rose up from his seat along with Sitā,"
9119,SECTION XXXII.,"with clasped hands, and received him as if he had been the sacrificial"
9120,SECTION XXXII.,"fire itself, and offered him excellent golden _Angadas_, shining"
9121,SECTION XXXII.,"ear-rings, necklaces of jewels fastened together with golden strings,"
9122,SECTION XXXII.,"_Keyuras_, bracelets, and various other ornaments, and spoke unto him,"
9123,SECTION XXXII.,"being desired by Sitā, the following words. ""O my gentle friend! do thou"
9124,SECTION XXXII.,by some servant send unto thy wife this necklace and _Hemasutra_. And
9125,SECTION XXXII.,"Sitā, the friend of thy wife, also intends to give this _Rasanā_ unto"
9126,SECTION XXXII.,"thy wife, And on the eve of her going to the woods, she presents thyself"
9127,SECTION XXXII.,and thy wife with _Angadas_ of curious workmanship and elegant
9128,SECTION XXXII.,_Keyuras_. And Vaidehi wishes to present thee with this fine bed-stead
9129,SECTION XXXII.,"with its coverlet studed with various precious jewels. And I offer thee,"
9130,SECTION XXXII.,"O great ascetic, with a thousand gold coins, this excellent elephant,"
9131,SECTION XXXII.,"called the destroyer of foes, which had been bestowed upon me by my"
9132,SECTION XXXII.,"maternal uncle."""
9133,SECTION XXXII.,
9134,SECTION XXXII.,"Being addressed thus by Rāma, Sujajna accepted all those offers, and"
9135,SECTION XXXII.,"showered benedictions upon Rāma, Sitā, and Lakshmana. Thereupon Rāma"
9136,SECTION XXXII.,"spoke unto his beloved, considerate and fair-speaking brother, the son"
9137,SECTION XXXII.,"of Sumitrā the following pleasant words, like unto Brahmā addressing the"
9138,SECTION XXXII.,"Lord of celestials. ""O son of Sumitrā, do thou invite the excellent"
9139,SECTION XXXII.,"Brāhmanas, Agastya and Viswāmitra, and adore them, O Rāghava, by"
9140,SECTION XXXII.,"conferring upon them gems, as people cherish corn with water. And O"
9141,SECTION XXXII.,"mighty armed one, do thou worship them, O Rāghava, with a thousand cows,"
9142,SECTION XXXII.,"gold, silver, and various precious jewels. Do thou confer upon that good"
9143,SECTION XXXII.,"Brāhmana, the preceptor of the _Tittiriya_ portion of the _Vedas_, who"
9144,SECTION XXXII.,"crowns Kauçalyā with blessings every day, silk cloth, conveyances,"
9145,SECTION XXXII.,"maid-servants, and such other things, till the twice-born one is"
9146,SECTION XXXII.,"satisfied. Do thou propitiate the worshipful Chitraratha, who is our"
9147,SECTION XXXII.,"charioteer and counsellor and of advanced years, with precious jewels"
9148,SECTION XXXII.,"clothes, wealth, with all kinds of beasts and a thousand cows. Do thou"
9149,SECTION XXXII.,"confer upon those Brāhmanas, O son of Sumitrā, who live under my"
9150,SECTION XXXII.,"protection, studying the _Kata_ section of _Yayur_ Veda, with staffs in"
9151,SECTION XXXII.,"their hands, a grant of eighty mules loaded with jewels, of a thousand"
9152,SECTION XXXII.,"miles of pines, and of a thousand cows, for curd and clarified butter."
9153,SECTION XXXII.,"They are always inactive, being constantly engaged in Vedic studies, and"
9154,SECTION XXXII.,"are greatly slothful though having a taste for delicious food, and are"
9155,SECTION XXXII.,"always esteemed by great men; to each of all those Brāhmanas, who always"
9156,SECTION XXXII.,"come to Kauçalyā, do thou, O Lakshmāna,make a grant of a thousand gold"
9157,SECTION XXXII.,"coins, and offer unto them all such gifts as may please my mother."""
9158,SECTION XXXII.,"Thereupon Lakshmana, that best of men, distributed amongst all these"
9159,SECTION XXXII.,Brāhmanas all the entire riches as ordered by Rāma like unto the Lord of
9160,SECTION XXXII.,"wealth. Seeing his dependants in a wretched plight, shedding tears"
9161,SECTION XXXII.,"continually, Rāma proferred unto them various articles for their"
9162,SECTION XXXII.,"maintenance, and said :—""Do ye occupy in turn until our return my rooms"
9163,SECTION XXXII.,"as well as Lakshmana’s."" Having spoken thus unto all those dependants"
9164,SECTION XXXII.,"who were racked with great sorrow, Rāma ordered the Treasury officer to"
9165,SECTION XXXII.,"bring his riches there. Thereat, the servants brought all his riches and"
9166,SECTION XXXII.,"collected them in great heaps. Rāma, the best of men, together with"
9167,SECTION XXXII.,"Lakshmana, distributed them amongst the Brāhmanas, boys, the old, and"
9168,SECTION XXXII.,"the poor. There lived in that quarter a Brāhmana of a tawny colour, by"
9169,SECTION XXXII.,"name Trijatā, descended from the line of Garga, earning his livelihood"
9170,SECTION XXXII.,by digging the earth with spades and ploughs. His young wife with her
9171,SECTION XXXII.,"little children, struggling with poverty, spoke thus unto the old"
9172,SECTION XXXII.,"Brāhmana. ""Throwing aside thy spades and ploughs, do thou hear my words."
9173,SECTION XXXII.,"Go and see the virtuous-souled Rāma, and thou art sure to get something"
9174,SECTION XXXII.,"from him now."" Hearing these words of his wife, Trijatā, shining in"
9175,SECTION XXXII.,"effulgence like unto Vrigu and Angira, covering his body with a torn"
9176,SECTION XXXII.,"piece of cloth, proceeded towards Rāma’s abode with his wife, and going"
9177,SECTION XXXII.,"on in a speedy and uninterrupted course, reached at last the royal abode"
9178,SECTION XXXII.,"and spoke unto Rāma thus:—""O mighty son of the king! a poor man am I,"
9179,SECTION XXXII.,having a number of children. I maintain my family by digging the earth;
9180,SECTION XXXII.,do thou therefore look upon me mercifully. Whereupon Rāma replied
9181,SECTION XXXII.,"laughing:—""I have not distributed as yet even one thousand of my cows."
9182,SECTION XXXII.,"Do thou hurl this rod, and thou art the master of all those cows"
9183,SECTION XXXII.,"occupying the space at the extremity of which this rod shall fall."" Upon"
9184,SECTION XXXII.,"this, swiftly tightening the cloth around his waist, Trijatā firmly"
9185,SECTION XXXII.,"grasping the rod hurled it with a mighty force. The rod, hurled off his"
9186,SECTION XXXII.,"hands, fell on the other side of the river Saraju in the midst of many"
9187,SECTION XXXII.,"thousand bullocks. Seeing this, the virtuous-souled Rāma despatched to"
9188,SECTION XXXII.,the hermitage of Trijatā all the cows that lay extending up to the banks
9189,SECTION XXXII.,"of the river Saraju, and consoling him afterwards accosted him with the"
9190,SECTION XXXII.,"following words. ""Be not offended, I acted thus only as a matter of"
9191,SECTION XXXII.,joke. I asked thee to do this only with the object of knowing whether
9192,SECTION XXXII.,thou hadst the power to hurl this rod. Do thou ask of me now any thing
9193,SECTION XXXII.,thou likest. Truly do I speak that thou shouldst not hesitate. I am
9194,SECTION XXXII.,ready to devote my wealth to the services of the Brāhmanas. And the
9195,SECTION XXXII.,"wealth I have earned will conduce to my favour, if. I can apply it to"
9196,SECTION XXXII.,"your service."""
9197,SECTION XXXII.,
9198,SECTION XXXII.,"Then Trijata, being pleased with the accession of cows, went away along"
9199,SECTION XXXII.,"with his wife, showering happiness and joy. Rāma of great manliness"
9200,SECTION XXXII.,afterwards distributed with proper respect and due welcome all his
9201,SECTION XXXII.,"wealth amassed by righteous means amongst the Brāhmanas, friends,"
9202,SECTION XXXII.,"servants and the poor, according to the recomendation of his friends."

9205,SECTION XXXII.,
9206,SECTION XXXIII.,SECTION XXXIII.
9207,SECTION XXXIII.,
9208,SECTION XXXIII.,
9209,SECTION XXXIII.,"Having distributed much wealth to the Brāhmanas, the Rāghavas set out"
9210,SECTION XXXIII.,with Sitā for the purpose of seeing their father. And the two looked
9211,SECTION XXXIII.,"beautiful with a couple of handmaids (following them), taking the"
9212,SECTION XXXIII.,weapons that had been decked by Sitā with flowery wreaths. Then crowds
9213,SECTION XXXIII.,"of elegantly-attired citizens, mounting on the terraces of three-"
9214,SECTION XXXIII.,"storied and seven-storied houses, looked on the scene with hearts filled"
9215,SECTION XXXIII.,with sorrow. And unable to tread the streets because of a vast
9216,SECTION XXXIII.,"concourse, they ascending the terraces of the buildings, eyed Rāghava"
9217,SECTION XXXIII.,"with woe-begone eyes. And deprived of their senses by grief, the"
9218,SECTION XXXIII.,"multitudes,¹³⁵ beholding Rāma proceeding on foot in company with Sitā"
9219,SECTION XXXIII.,"and his younger brother, said,—""He that used to be followed by the vast"
9220,SECTION XXXIII.,"body of the four-fold forces, proceeds now along with Sitā, followed by"
9221,SECTION XXXIII.,"Lakshmana alone. Knowing every kind of enjoyment, that magnanimous one"
9222,SECTION XXXIII.,"who has tasted of every luxury, for maintaining the dignity of morality,"
9223,SECTION XXXIII.,does not wish to falsify (his father’s) word. And that Sitā whom
9224,SECTION XXXIII.,"formerly the very rangers of the sky could not see, is to-day beheld by"
9225,SECTION XXXIII.,the passers-by. Now summer’s heat and winter’s cold and the rains of the
9226,SECTION XXXIII.,"wet season will speedily stain Sitā, whose person is worthy of being"
9227,SECTION XXXIII.,"dyed, and who used to daub her limbs with red sandal paste. Surely"
9228,SECTION XXXIII.,"to-day Daçarātha speaks thus, possessed by some evil spirit; for the"
9229,SECTION XXXIII.,king ought by no means to banish his beloved son. Who ever exiles his
9230,SECTION XXXIII.,"son, albeit he be worthless? And what is to be said concerning a son"
9231,SECTION XXXIII.,that has fast secured all men’s hearts by his behavior? Universal
9232,SECTION XXXIII.,"benevolence, kindness, learning goodness, the restraint of the senses,"
9233,SECTION XXXIII.,"and the control of the faculties,—these six qualities adorn that best of"
9234,SECTION XXXIII.,"men, Rāghava. Therefore the subjects will be afflicted in consequence of"
9235,SECTION XXXIII.,"his separation, even as aquatic animals are, when summer dries up the"
9236,SECTION XXXIII.,waters of a tank. The entire earth is distressed on account of the
9237,SECTION XXXIII.,"distress of this lord of the earth, even like a tree bearing blossoms"
9238,SECTION XXXIII.,"and fruits, when its roots have been severed. Surely this highly"
9239,SECTION XXXIII.,"effulgent one with virtue for his chief good, is the root of humanity,"
9240,SECTION XXXIII.,"and the latter represents its flowers, fruits, foliage, and boughs."
9241,SECTION XXXIII.,"Therefore, accompanied by our wives and friends will we like Lakshmana"
9242,SECTION XXXIII.,follow the departing Rāghava by the same way that he takes. And leaving
9243,SECTION XXXIII.,"aside our gardens and fields and abodes, will we, making the righteous"

9245,SECTION XXXIII.,"herself of our deserted mansions, deprived of their buried treasures,"
9246,SECTION XXXIII.,"with their unswept courtyards robbed of kine and wealth, and shorn of"
9247,SECTION XXXIII.,"all substance, filled with dust, and abandoned by the deities, mansions"
9248,SECTION XXXIII.,"where rats will run from hole to hole, which will neither emit smoke nor"

9252,SECTION XXXIII.,"absent, and around which will be strewn broken earthenware, as they are"

9254,SECTION XXXIII.,"calamities. Let the forest to which Rāghava repairs resemble a city, and"
9255,SECTION XXXIII.,let this city renounced by us be converted into a wilderness. Inspired
9256,SECTION XXXIII.,"by the fear of us, serpents will leave their holes, and beasts and birds"
9257,SECTION XXXIII.,"the caves of mountain, and elephants and lions the forest. Let them"
9258,SECTION XXXIII.,"occupy the tracts left behind by us, and let them renounce such"
9259,SECTION XXXIII.,"abounding in serpents, beasts, and birds, as yield grass, meat, and"
9260,SECTION XXXIII.,fruits. Let Kaikeyi (reign in this realm) along with her sons and
9261,SECTION XXXIII.,"adherents; we, renouncing homes, will dwell in the forest with Rāghava."""
9262,SECTION XXXIII.,
9263,SECTION XXXIII.,Rāghava heard various words uttered thus by the populace; and having
9264,SECTION XXXIII.,"heard them, he did not suffer his mind to be agitated. And that"
9265,SECTION XXXIII.,"righteous one of the prowess of a mad elephant, from a distance began to"
9266,SECTION XXXIII.,make for the residence of his father resembling in brightness a summit
9267,SECTION XXXIII.,"of the Kailāça mountain. Entering the king’s mansion, he drawing nigh"
9268,SECTION XXXIII.,found the heroic Sumantra seated in dejected mood. Seeing that
9269,SECTION XXXIII.,"well-wisher of his thus depressed, Rāma endeavouring by all means to do"
9270,SECTION XXXIII.,"his father’s bidding, cheerfully went on, desirous of beholding his"
9271,SECTION XXXIII.,sire. And with the view of meeting the aggrieved king before repairing
9272,SECTION XXXIII.,"to the forest, the magnanimous son of the Ikshwāku race, seeing"
9273,SECTION XXXIII.,"Sumantra, stayed there,—so that that noble-minded one might inform his"
9274,SECTION XXXIII.,father of his visit. And making up his mind to go to the woods in
9275,SECTION XXXIII.,"accordance with the command of his father, Rāghava seeing Sumantra, said"
9276,SECTION XXXIII.,"unto him; ""Do you inform the king of my arrival."""

9284,SECTION XXXIV.,
9285,SECTION XXXIV.,
9286,SECTION XXXIV.,Then the mighty and incomparable Rāma of eyes resembling lotus-petals
9287,SECTION XXXIV.,"said unto the charioteer,—""Do you announce me to my father."" Thus"
9288,SECTION XXXIV.,"commissoned by Rāma, the charioteer entering the apartment, found the"
9289,SECTION XXXIV.,"king heaving sighs, his senses overwhelmed with grief. And he saw the"
9290,SECTION XXXIV.,"monarch like the sun afflicted by Rāhu, or like fire enveloped in ashes,"
9291,SECTION XXXIV.,or like a tank deprived of its water. Thereupon concluding that the king
9292,SECTION XXXIV.,"agitated by sorrow was bewailing Rāma, the charioteer said with joined"
9293,SECTION XXXIV.,"hands. And first paying homage unto the king, invoking victory upon him,"
9294,SECTION XXXIV.,"the charioteer, perplexed with fear, softly and sweetly addressed the"
9295,SECTION XXXIV.,"monarch thus:—""O foremost of men, your son waits at the entrance, after"
9296,SECTION XXXIV.,having distributed wealth to Brāhmanas and his retinue Let that one
9297,SECTION XXXIV.,"having truth for prowess, good betide you, see you. Having greeted all"
9298,SECTION XXXIV.,"his friends,he now wishes to see you. Know that he is about to set out"
9299,SECTION XXXIV.,"for the mighty forest. Do you, O Lord of earth, see him furnished with"
9300,SECTION XXXIV.,"every perfection, like the Sun himself surrounded by his rays."""
9301,SECTION XXXIV.,"Thereupon, that virtuous and truthful (king) resembling the ocean by"
9302,SECTION XXXIV.,"virtue of his gravity, and motionless like the welkin, answered"
9303,SECTION XXXIV.,"Sumantra, saying,—""O Sumantra, do thou bring hither my wives."" Reaching"
9304,SECTION XXXIV.,"the inner apartment, the charioteer said unto the ladies,—""The"
9305,SECTION XXXIV.,"worshipful king calls you. Do you come speedily."" Thus addressed by"
9306,SECTION XXXIV.,"Sumantra at the mandate of the monarch, the ladies in a body, informed"
9307,SECTION XXXIV.,"of their husband’s command, went to the king’s apartment. And three"
9308,SECTION XXXIV.,hundred and fifty females furnished with coppery eyes and observing
9309,SECTION XXXIV.,"vows, surrounding Kauçalyā, proceeded slowly. On the females coming"
9310,SECTION XXXIV.,"there, the monarch seeing this, said unto the charioteer,—""O Sumantra,"
9311,SECTION XXXIV.,"do you bring hither my son."" Thereat the charioteer taking Rāma,"
9312,SECTION XXXIV.,"Lākshmana and Mithila’s daughter, speedily came before the lord of"
9313,SECTION XXXIV.,"earth. The king seeing his son drawing nigh with joined hands, hastily"
9314,SECTION XXXIV.,rose up from his seat in company with his wives. And casting his eyes on
9315,SECTION XXXIV.,"Rāma, the king rushed towards him, but before reaching his son, the"
9316,SECTION XXXIV.,aggrieved monarch fell down to the earth in a swoon. Rāma and that
9317,SECTION XXXIV.,migthy car-warrior Lakshmana swiftly neared the king striken with grief
9318,SECTION XXXIV.,and rendered senseless by sorrow. And there arose in the palace cries of
9319,SECTION XXXIV.,"women by thousands of ""Ah Rāma,"" mingled with the tinkling of ornaments."
9320,SECTION XXXIV.,Then both Rāma and Lakshmana along with Sitā took the king up with their
9321,SECTION XXXIV.,"arms, and with tears in their eyes laid him upon the couch. When the"
9322,SECTION XXXIV.,lord of the earth oppressed with the vapour begot of grief and
9323,SECTION XXXIV.,"overwhelmed with emotion, had regained his senses, Rāma with joined"
9324,SECTION XXXIV.,"palms said—""I ask you, O mighty monarch, as you are the lord of all. Do"
9325,SECTION XXXIV.,you see me safely despatched to the forest of Dandaka. Do you permit
9326,SECTION XXXIV.,"Lakshmana, and let Sitā also follow mc to the woods; for although"
9327,SECTION XXXIV.,"prohibited by me with various reasons, they do not wish to be left"
9328,SECTION XXXIV.,"behind. Do you, O bestower of honor, permit us all, renouncing"
9329,SECTION XXXIV.,"sorrow—Lakshmana and Sitā and me,—like Prajāpati permitting his sons."""
9330,SECTION XXXIV.,"Seeing Rāghava about to set out for the forest, the lord of earth said"
9331,SECTION XXXIV.,"unto the calm Rāma waiting for his orders,—""O Rāghava, I have been"
9332,SECTION XXXIV.,deprived of my senses in consequence of my having conferred boons on
9333,SECTION XXXIV.,"Kaikeyi. Do you therefore confining me to-day become king in Ayodhyā."""
9334,SECTION XXXIV.,"Thus addressed by the monarch, Rāma—the best of the righteous—well"
9335,SECTION XXXIV.,"versed in speech, with joined hands addressed his father thus,—""O king"
9336,SECTION XXXIV.,"do you rule this earth for a thousand years,—I will reside in the"
9337,SECTION XXXIV.,forest. I do not wish for the kingdom. Having spent five and nine years
9338,SECTION XXXIV.,"in the woods, I shall again embrace your feet, lord of men, after"
9339,SECTION XXXIV.,"fulfilling your vow."" Fettered in the net of promise, the king bewailing"
9340,SECTION XXXIV.,"his beloved son, secretly spurred on by Kaikeyi, said,—""Do you, my"
9341,SECTION XXXIV.,"darling, with the view of attaining welfare here and hereafter and"
9342,SECTION XXXIV.,"auspicious fortune, go calmly your fearless way,—so that you may return"
9343,SECTION XXXIV.,"hither (in time.) I dare not, O descendant of the Raghu race, forbid you"
9344,SECTION XXXIV.,who are established in truth and who are bent upon discharging your
9345,SECTION XXXIV.,"duty. But, O son, do not by any means depart to-night: beholding you"
9346,SECTION XXXIV.,"even for a single day, I shall feed with you. Do you, seeing me as well"
9347,SECTION XXXIV.,"as your mother, stay here to-night. Then ministered unto every way, you"
9348,SECTION XXXIV.,"will set out to-morrow. O son, O beloved Rāghava difficult is the task"
9349,SECTION XXXIV.,"that you are going to perform,—for compassing my good in the next world,"
9350,SECTION XXXIV.,"you are ready to repair to the very woods! But, O Rāghava, I swear unto"
9351,SECTION XXXIV.,"you, this is anything but agreeable to me, my son. I have been made to"
9352,SECTION XXXIV.,swerve from my purpose by the crafty Kaikeyi resembling a fire hidden
9353,SECTION XXXIV.,under ashes. You are going to give effect to the deceit that has been
9354,SECTION XXXIV.,practised upon me by this woman intent upon sullying her line. And as
9355,SECTION XXXIV.,"you are my eldest son, it is no wonder, O son, that you should wish to"
9356,SECTION XXXIV.,"maintain your father’s truth."" Hearing these words of his distressed"
9357,SECTION XXXIV.,"father, the humble Rāma, along with his brother Lakshmana, said,—""Who"
9358,SECTION XXXIV.,will confer on me the merit tomorrow that I shall reap by going to-day?
9359,SECTION XXXIV.,"Therefore, I prefer even the journey to the woods to enjoying comforts"
9360,SECTION XXXIV.,here. Do you bestow upon Bharata this earth renounced by me— this
9361,SECTION XXXIV.,kingdom abounding in corn and kine and filled with people; my mind
9362,SECTION XXXIV.,"determined upon dwelling in the forest, does not waver. Do you, O"
9363,SECTION XXXIV.,"bestower of boons, grant Kaikeyi everything that you had promised unto"
9364,SECTION XXXIV.,"her at the time of the war¹³⁶ (you had waged against the Dānavas), and"
9365,SECTION XXXIV.,"thereby do you follow truth. Obeying the mandate that you have issued, I"
9366,SECTION XXXIV.,will dwell in the forest for fourteen years in the company of the
9367,SECTION XXXIV.,rangers of the woods. Do you without feeling any compunction confer the
9368,SECTION XXXIV.,earth on Bharata. Mine is not the desire to obtain the kingdom for
9369,SECTION XXXIV.,"enjoying happiness or attaining any benefit. I will, O descendant of the"
9370,SECTION XXXIV.,"Raghu race, do your bidding. Banish your grief, and suppress your tears."
9371,SECTION XXXIV.,"That lord of streams, the irresistible ocean, never forsakes his own"
9372,SECTION XXXIV.,"magnanimity. I desire neither dominion, nor happiness, nor the earth,¹³⁷"
9373,SECTION XXXIV.,"nor any object¹³⁸ of enjoyment, nor heaven, nor life. O foremost of men,"
9374,SECTION XXXIV.,"all I wish for is that you may not come by falsehood, and abide by"
9375,SECTION XXXIV.,"truth. I truly and in good sooth swear before you that I cannot, O lord,"
9376,SECTION XXXIV.,"remain here for a moment longer, O my father. Do you bear this grief. I"
9377,SECTION XXXIV.,cannot for certain act contrary to my promise. Directed by Kaikeyi
9378,SECTION XXXIV.,"saying,— ’Do you, O Rāghava, go to the forest,’ I had said,—’I will"
9379,SECTION XXXIV.,"go,’—That promise I must accomplish. Do you not, O revered one, feel"
9380,SECTION XXXIV.,aggrieved. We will abide in the forest abounding in mild deer and
9381,SECTION XXXIV.,resounding with the notes of various birds. The father is a very
9382,SECTION XXXIV.,"God,—even the celestials say this. Therefore will I look upon your word"
9383,SECTION XXXIV.,"in the light of divinity. And, O best of monarchs, after the fourteen"
9384,SECTION XXXIV.,"years have been spent, you will see me again by your side,— therefore do"
9385,SECTION XXXIV.,"you banish this grief. Why do you, O foremost of men, who will suppress"
9386,SECTION XXXIV.,"other’s grief, undergo this alteration? Do you confer upon Bharata this"
9387,SECTION XXXIV.,"city and this kingdom and the earth renounced by me. Doing your behest,"
9388,SECTION XXXIV.,"I will repair to the forest, sojourning there for a long time. Staying"
9389,SECTION XXXIV.,"at the auspicious frontiers, let Bharata barely rule this earth"
9390,SECTION XXXIV.,"furnished with watery expanses, cities and forests, when it has been"
9391,SECTION XXXIV.,"renounced by me. O king, let what you have said be as you wish it. I do"
9392,SECTION XXXIV.,"not, O king, set my heart upon any great object of desire, nor do I seek"
9393,SECTION XXXIV.,"my own behoof, as I am bent upon, O you beloved of the good, working out"
9394,SECTION XXXIV.,"your will. O sinless one, you will not therefore reap any evil on my"
9395,SECTION XXXIV.,"account. Associating you with untruth, I would not, O sinless one, wish"
9396,SECTION XXXIV.,"even for your company who are agitated with anxiety,¹³⁹ or this entire"
9397,SECTION XXXIV.,"kingdom, or every object of desire, or the earth, or Mithilā’s daughter."
9398,SECTION XXXIV.,"Even this is my truthful vow,—let also your vow prove true. Living upon"

9400,SECTION XXXIV.,"streams and graceful trees, I shall be happy on entering the forest, Do"
9401,SECTION XXXIV.,"you cease to lament."" Thus benetted with calamities and exercised with"
9402,SECTION XXXIV.,"grief and anguish, the king embraced his son,—and then deprived of his"
9403,SECTION XXXIV.,consciousness fell down on the ground and became motionless. Thereat all
9404,SECTION XXXIV.,the queens save that wife of the monarch (Kaikeyi) bewailed together;
9405,SECTION XXXIV.,and crying Sumantra also went into a swoc And the place was filled all

9428,SECTION XXXV.,"worshipful one, since you have forsaken king Daçarātha, the maintainer"
9429,SECTION XXXV.,"of this world and the mobile and the immobile that it contains, there is"
9430,SECTION XXXV.,nothing that is incapable of being done by you. I consider you the
9431,SECTION XXXV.,murderess of your husband and as one that has finally exterminated one’s
9432,SECTION XXXV.,line; inasmuch as you have by your act afflicted the monarch invincible
9433,SECTION XXXV.,"like Indra, firm as a hill, and imperturbable like the deep itself. You"
9434,SECTION XXXV.,ought not to bring down your boon-bestowing lord and husband Daçarātha;
9435,SECTION XXXV.,for surely the wish of a husband to a wife outweighs a _koti_ of sons.
9436,SECTION XXXV.,The princes will obtain the kingdom one after another according to age;—
9437,SECTION XXXV.,this custom it is your study to render nugatory even when the lord of

9443,SECTION XXXV.,"reap by remaining here, allured by the lust of dominion? And you are"
9444,SECTION XXXV.,"going to do such an act!]¹⁴⁰ A wonder it is that I perceive, viz,—that"
9445,SECTION XXXV.,the earth hid by a character like you is not riven this very day. And
9446,SECTION XXXV.,why doth not the flaming and dreadful censure uttered by the mighty
9447,SECTION XXXV.,Brahmārshis destroy you who are bent upon banishing Rāma? Who having
9448,SECTION XXXV.,"hewn a mangoe tree by his axe, tendeth a Nimba? It never turns sweet for"
9449,SECTION XXXV.,him that waters it. Your birth is noble indeed; it is as much so as is
9450,SECTION XXXV.,your mother’s. They say that sweet is never extracted from Nimba. I
9451,SECTION XXXV.,remember what I have heard from old men concerning the vicious
9452,SECTION XXXV.,inclinations of your mother.
9453,SECTION XXXV.,
9454,SECTION XXXV.,Some one intent upon conferring boons conferred an excellent one on your
9455,SECTION XXXV.,"father. In virtue of this, that lord of earth could understand the"
9456,SECTION XXXV.,"import of sounds emitted by all beings, and it is in consequence of this"
9457,SECTION XXXV.,that he could understand the speech even of birds and beasts. One day as
9458,SECTION XXXV.,"your father was lying down, he, understanding the thoughts of a gold-"
9459,SECTION XXXV.,"hued Jrimbha bird, from its cries, laughed heartily. Thereat your mother"
9460,SECTION XXXV.,"getting angry, wishing for the noose of death, said,—’O king, O placid"
9461,SECTION XXXV.,"one, I ask you for the reason of your laughter.’ The king replied,—’O"
9462,SECTION XXXV.,"worshipful lady, if I unfold unto you the reason of my laugh, then I"
9463,SECTION XXXV.,"shall without doubt die to-day.’ But that revered one, your mother,"
9464,SECTION XXXV.,"again urged Kekaya, saying,—’Tell it to me, whether you live or die; for"
9465,SECTION XXXV.,"(when I have learnt all about it), you will not be able to laugh at me"
9466,SECTION XXXV.,"again.’ Thus addressed by his beloved spouse, that lord of earth Kekaya"
9467,SECTION XXXV.,went to the saint that had conferred the boon on him and related unto
9468,SECTION XXXV.,him everything faithfully. Thereupon that boon-giving saint said unto
9469,SECTION XXXV.,"the kin; ""Whether this one kills herself or be destroyed, do you not, O"
9470,SECTION XXXV.,"king reveal it."" Hearing these words of his, the king well pleased"
9471,SECTION XXXV.,summarily forsook your mother and began to divert himself like Kuvera.
9472,SECTION XXXV.,"Even in the same way, you, O you that see only evil, staying in an"
9473,SECTION XXXV.,"unrighteous count befouling the king’s sense, endeavour to make him"
9474,SECTION XXXV.,"commit this wrong. In this connection I remember a saying, viz.,— men"
9475,SECTION XXXV.,"take after their fathers, and women their mothers. Do not be so,—do you"
9476,SECTION XXXV.,"even accept what the lord of earth says. Doing the will of your lord, do"

9478,SECTION XXXV.,make your husband the lord of men endued with the prowess of the
9479,SECTION XXXV.,"celestial chief, perpetrate an unrighteous deed. That sinless one will"
9480,SECTION XXXV.,not for certain give practical effect to the promise jestingly made by
9481,SECTION XXXV.,"you. O worshipful one, king Daçarātha is graceful, being furnished with"
9482,SECTION XXXV.,"eyes resembling lotuses. Let him install his eldest son, Rāma generous"
9483,SECTION XXXV.,"and able, maintaining his own religion—the protector of all men—and"
9484,SECTION XXXV.,"endued with might. O revered lady, great is the obloquy that will spread"
9485,SECTION XXXV.,"concerning you, if leaving his royal father, Rāma repaireth to the"

9491,SECTION XXXV.,with soft yet cutting words endeavoured to strike Kaikeyi with regret.

9508,SECTION XXXVI.,let sweet- speeched courtezans and opulent traders grace the extensive
9509,SECTION XXXVI.,"army of the prince. And, giving them immense wealth, do you also send"
9510,SECTION XXXVI.,"with him those that depend on Rāma, as well as those with whom he"
9511,SECTION XXXVI.,"delights to wrestle. And let the foremost weapons, and the citizens, and"
9512,SECTION XXXVI.,"cars, and fowlers well acquainted with the forest go in the wake of"
9513,SECTION XXXVI.,"Kākutstha. Killing deer and elephants, and drinking wild honey, and"
9514,SECTION XXXVI.,"beholding various rivers, they will ultimately forget this kingdom. And"
9515,SECTION XXXVI.,let our granary and treasury follow Rāma who is to reside in the forest.
9516,SECTION XXXVI.,"Performing sacrifices at holy spots, and dispensing the prescribed"
9517,SECTION XXXVI.,"_Dakshinas_, let Rāma happily reside in the forest in the company of"
9518,SECTION XXXVI.,"saints. The mighty- armed Bharata will govern Ayodhyā. Therefore, do you"
9519,SECTION XXXVI.,"furnish the auspicious Rāma with every object of enjoyment."" When that"
9520,SECTION XXXVI.,"descendant of Kākutstha said this, Kaikeyi was inspired with"
9521,SECTION XXXVI.,"apprehension: her countenance became blank, and her utterance was"
9522,SECTION XXXVI.,"choked. Losing her complexion and agitated with fear, with her"
9523,SECTION XXXVI.,"countenance fallen, Kaikeyi faced the king and said,—""O righteous one,"
9524,SECTION XXXVI.,"like unto a liquor whose lees alone have been left, Bharata will not"
9525,SECTION XXXVI.,"receive the kingdom tasteless and denuded of all substance."" While the"
9526,SECTION XXXVI.,"shameless Kaikeyi was speaking thus sternly, king Daçarātha said unto"
9527,SECTION XXXVI.,"that one of expansive eyes,—""O worker of mischief, why having laid the"
9528,SECTION XXXVI.,"load upon me, do you torment me? O ignoble one, why did you not ask for"
9529,SECTION XXXVI.,"this, when you did first solicit the boon?"" Hearing these wrathful words"
9530,SECTION XXXVI.,"of the king, that beauteous one, Kaikeyi, waxing doubly wroth, addressed"
9531,SECTION XXXVI.,"the monarch, saying,—""Even in this line of yours, Sagara deprived his"
9532,SECTION XXXVI.,eldest son Asamanja by name of the enjoyment of the kingdom. In this way
9533,SECTION XXXVI.,"this one deserves to go to the forest."" Thus addressed, king Daçarātha"
9534,SECTION XXXVI.,"said,—""O fie!"" and all present were afflicted with shame; but Kaikeyi"
9535,SECTION XXXVI.,"feigned not to understand all this. Then a notable, aged, pure-spirited"
9536,SECTION XXXVI.,"personage held in high esteem by the monarch, named Siddhārtha,"
9537,SECTION XXXVI.,"addressed Kaikeyi, saying,—""Asamanja by way of sport catching people on"
9538,SECTION XXXVI.,"the way, used to throw them into the waters of the Sarayu, and that"
9539,SECTION XXXVI.,"wicked-minded wretch made merry over the same. Seeing him do so, the"
9540,SECTION XXXVI.,"citizens in a body, waxing wroth spoke unto the monarch,—’O enhancer of"
9541,SECTION XXXVI.,"the kingdom’s prosperity, do you either banish Asamanja or us.’ To them"
9542,SECTION XXXVI.,"he replied,—’Whence is this fear of yours?’ Thus asked by the monarch,"
9543,SECTION XXXVI.,"the subjects said,—’Through his impudence this one of perverted sense by"
9544,SECTION XXXVI.,"way of diversion throwing our sons into the Sarayu, finds extreme"
9545,SECTION XXXVI.,"delight.’ Hearing these words of his subjects, that lord of men, with"
9546,SECTION XXXVI.,"the intention of doing good to them, forsook that mischievous son of"
9547,SECTION XXXVI.,"his. Then swiftly causing a car to be yoked, he said unto his men,—This"
9548,SECTION XXXVI.,one is to be banished for life in proper garb along with his wife.’
9549,SECTION XXXVI.,Thereupon that worker of iniquity went to the forest and went about
9550,SECTION XXXVI.,seeing mountain fastnesses. Thus did the virtuous king Sagara renounce
9551,SECTION XXXVI.,his son. But what offence has Rāma committed that he is to be banished?
9552,SECTION XXXVI.,We do not find any fault whatever in Rāghava. Rare is his fault even
9553,SECTION XXXVI.,"like the spot on the Moon. Or it may be, O exalted lady, that you"
9554,SECTION XXXVI.,"perceive some fault in Rāghava,—Do you, if so, unfold it; and then let"
9555,SECTION XXXVI.,Rāma be banished. But the renunciation of the honest ever constant in a
9556,SECTION XXXVI.,"righteous course, in consequence of its being opposed to virtue,"
9557,SECTION XXXVI.,"destroys the splendour of Sakra himself. Therefore, O noble one, cease"
9558,SECTION XXXVI.,"to persevere in this, for what good would the marring of Rāma’s good"
9559,SECTION XXXVI.,"fortune bring you? And, O you of a fair countenace, you will by such a"
9560,SECTION XXXVI.,"course escape odium."" Hearing Siddhārtha’ s words, the king, his voice"
9561,SECTION XXXVI.,"waxing exceedingly feeble, addressed Kaikeyi in words surcharged with"
9562,SECTION XXXVI.,"emotion,—""O Personation of sin, thou relishest not this speech. Thou"
9563,SECTION XXXVI.,"knowest not either thy own good or mine. This wicked endeavour of thine,"
9564,SECTION XXXVI.,"O thou that strivest after harm, which thou puttest forth adopting a"
9565,SECTION XXXVI.,"narrow path, is surely divorced from the course of the good. Forsaking"
9566,SECTION XXXVI.,"my kingdom, forsaking happiness and treasures, I will to-day follow"
9567,SECTION XXXVI.,Rāma. Do thou with Bharata for the king forever enjoy dominion according
9568,SECTION XXXVI.,"to thy heart’s desire,"""

9571,SECTION XXXVI.,
9572,SECTION XXXVII.,SECTION XXXVII.
9573,SECTION XXXVII.,
9574,SECTION XXXVII.,
9575,SECTION XXXVII.,"HEARING the words of that worthy, Rāma conversant with modesty, humbly"
9576,SECTION XXXVII.,"addressed Daçarātha, saying,—""What O king, have I, that am renouncing"
9577,SECTION XXXVII.,everything and am going to dwell in the forest subsisting on what the
9578,SECTION XXXVII.,"forest yields, to do with a following? Of what avail is a person’s"
9579,SECTION XXXVII.,"attachment for the tether of a goodly elephant, when the elephant itself"
9580,SECTION XXXVII.,"is renounced by him? Thus it is with me, O foremost of righteous ones."
9581,SECTION XXXVII.,"What shall I do with the army, O lord of men? I will confer everything"
9582,SECTION XXXVII.,"on Bharata. Let them bring me a vesture of bark, and for me who will go"
9583,SECTION XXXVII.,"to the forest and reside there for fourteen years, bring a hoe and a"
9584,SECTION XXXVII.,"basket."" Thereupon Kaikeyi herself brought a bark dress and that"
9585,SECTION XXXVII.,"shameless one said unto Rāghnva in the presence of all,—""Do you wear"
9586,SECTION XXXVII.,"this."" On this, that foremost of men taking those two pieces of bark"
9587,SECTION XXXVII.,"from Kaikeyi, left his fine attire and put on the ascetic garb. And"
9588,SECTION XXXVII.,"Lakshmana also, renouncing his choice raiment, put on the dress of an"
9589,SECTION XXXVII.,"anchoret before his father. Then Sitā clad in silk apparel, eying the"
9590,SECTION XXXVII.,"ascetic covering meant for her, became agitated, like a doe at sight of"
9591,SECTION XXXVII.,"a noose. And afflicted with shame, that one graced with auspicious"
9592,SECTION XXXVII.,"marks, Jānaki, sorrowfully took from Kaikeyi the Kuça and bark; and with"
9593,SECTION XXXVII.,"tears flooding her eyes, that one cognizant of virtue and having her"
9594,SECTION XXXVII.,"gaze ever fixed upon it, thus addressed her lord resembling the king of"
9595,SECTION XXXVII.,"the Gandharbas,—""How do the ascetics dwelling in the woods put on their"
9596,SECTION XXXVII.,"dress?"" Saying this, Sitā, ill at ease became embrassed. And putting on"
9597,SECTION XXXVII.,"one piece on her neck and holding the other in her hand, the daughter of"
9598,SECTION XXXVII.,"Janaka, feeling uneasy, stood overpowered with shame. Thereupon that"
9599,SECTION XXXVII.,"best of righteous persons, Rāma, speedily coming up to her, fastened the"
9600,SECTION XXXVII.,monastic garb over Sitā’s silk attire. Beholding Rāma fastening that
9601,SECTION XXXVII.,"goodly garb on Sitā, the females of the inner apartment began to shed"
9602,SECTION XXXVII.,"tears. And waxing exceedingly aggrieved, they spoke unto Rāma flaming in"
9603,SECTION XXXVII.,"effulgence:—""Child, do not take this virtuous one to the forest. So long"
9604,SECTION XXXVII.,as you will reside in the forest in accordance with the wishes of your
9605,SECTION XXXVII.,"father, we shall behold her; and by this means let our lives attain"
9606,SECTION XXXVII.,"their object, O lord. O son taking Lakshmana for your help, go you to"
9607,SECTION XXXVII.,the forest. This auspuious one does not deserve to live in the woods
9608,SECTION XXXVII.,"like an ascetic. O son, grant our prayer. Let the fair Sitā remain. Ever"
9609,SECTION XXXVII.,"steady in virtue, you do not yourself intend to stay here."" Hearing"
9610,SECTION XXXVII.,"these words, Daçarātha’s son tied the dress on Sitā having a similar"
9611,SECTION XXXVII.,character with himself. When she had put on the upper and under
9612,SECTION XXXVII.,"garments, the preceptor of the king, Vasistha, his voice choked with the"
9613,SECTION XXXVII.,"vapour of sorrow, dissuading Sitā, said unto Kaikeyi,—""O thou whose"
9614,SECTION XXXVII.,"desires outrun thy sense of honor, O thou of perverted understanding O"
9615,SECTION XXXVII.,"befouler of thy line, deceiving the monarch, thou stayest not within the"
9616,SECTION XXXVII.,"pale of the promise. O thou bereft of good behavior, that noble lady,"
9617,SECTION XXXVII.,"Sitā, should not go to the forest. Sitā will occupy Rāma’s seat. Of all"
9618,SECTION XXXVII.,"those that marry, the wife is the (other) soul. Sitā will govern the"
9619,SECTION XXXVII.,"earth, as she is Rāma’s self. But if Vaidehi goes to the forest with"
9620,SECTION XXXVII.,"Rāma, we will follow him, and the inhabitants of the city will also"
9621,SECTION XXXVII.,"repair thither. And the warders of the inner apartment, and the people"
9622,SECTION XXXVII.,of the kingdom and the city taking with them their neccessaries and
9623,SECTION XXXVII.,servants will accompany Rāghava and his wife. And Bharata and Satrughna
9624,SECTION XXXVII.,wearing ascetic clothes and ranging the forest will live like their
9625,SECTION XXXVII.,elder brother resident in the woods. Then alone thou of vile ways and
9626,SECTION XXXVII.,intent upon harming the people wilt govern this empty earth deserted by
9627,SECTION XXXVII.,"the inhabitants, along with the trees. That can never be a kingdom where"
9628,SECTION XXXVII.,"Rāma is not the monarch, and that forest where Rāma will reside will"
9629,SECTION XXXVII.,flourish into a monarchy. Bharata never wishes to govern a kingdom that
9630,SECTION XXXVII.,"has not been conferred upon him by his father; nor, if he has really"
9631,SECTION XXXVII.,"been begotten by the monarch, wilt he any further act by you as a son."
9632,SECTION XXXVII.,"Even if you leaving the earth fly unto the air, that one cognizant of"
9633,SECTION XXXVII.,"the character of his ancestry, will never act otherwise. Therefore"
9634,SECTION XXXVII.,"although intent on advancing your son, you have really brought about his"
9635,SECTION XXXVII.,injury. There exists not a person in the world that is not partial to
9636,SECTION XXXVII.,"Rāma. O Kaikeyi, do you to-day behold beasts and snakes and birds"
9637,SECTION XXXVII.,"journeying in the wake of Rāma, and even the trees stand with their"
9638,SECTION XXXVII.,"heads turned towards him. Do you, O noble lady, removing the ascetic"
9639,SECTION XXXVII.,"guise, confer elegant ornaments on your daughter-in-law, for such a"
9640,SECTION XXXVII.,"dress suits not this one."" Saying this Vasistha prevented Kaikeyi. ""O"
9641,SECTION XXXVII.,"daughter of kmg Kekaya, you have asked for the abode of Rāma in the"
9642,SECTION XXXVII.,woods; and decked out in ornaments let Sitā daily engaged in adorning
9643,SECTION XXXVII.,"herself, reside in the forest with Rāghava. And let the daughter of the"
9644,SECTION XXXVII.,"King go to the forest, surrounded by excellent cars and servants, and"
9645,SECTION XXXVII.,taking with her attires and other necessary things. When you demanded
9646,SECTION XXXVII.,"the (fulfilment of the) promise, you had not your eye on Sitā."" When"
9647,SECTION XXXVII.,"that foremost of* Brāhmanas, that preceptor of the king possessed of"
9648,SECTION XXXVII.,"unparalelled potency, had said this, Sitā, desirous of serving her"
9649,SECTION XXXVII.,"beloved lord, did not turn away from the ascetic dress (presented by"
9650,SECTION XXXVII.,Kaikeyi.)

9653,SECTION XXXVII.,
9654,SECTION XXXVIII.,SECTION XXXVIII.
9655,SECTION XXXVIII.,
9656,SECTION XXXVIII.,
9657,SECTION XXXVIII.,"WHEN Sitā, having a husband although seeming as if she had none, was"
9658,SECTION XXXVIII.,"putting on the ascetic guise, the people got into a wrath and exclaimed,"
9659,SECTION XXXVIII.,"""O Daāaratha, fie on you!"" Aggrieved at the uproar that arose there in"
9660,SECTION XXXVIII.,"consequence, the lord of earth banished from his heart all regard for"
9661,SECTION XXXVIII.,"life, virtue, and fame. And sighing hot, that descendant Ikshwāku spoke"
9662,SECTION XXXVIII.,"onto that wife of his, saying,—""O Kaikeyi, Sitā deserves not to go in a"
9663,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Kuça dress. Tender, and youthful, and worthy of happiness, she is by no"
9664,SECTION XXXVIII.,means capable of living in the forest. My spiritual guide has spoken the
9665,SECTION XXXVIII.,"truth. Whom has this one injured that, being the daughter of the"
9666,SECTION XXXVIII.,"foremost of kings, she like a female ascetic, wearing a meagre garb in"
9667,SECTION XXXVIII.,"the presence of all, will (repair to the woods and) remain there like a"
9668,SECTION XXXVIII.,beggar destitute of everything? Let Janaka’s daughter leave off her
9669,SECTION XXXVIII.,ascetic guise. This is not the promise that I had made to you before.
9670,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Let the princess go to the forest in comfort, furnished with all sorts"
9671,SECTION XXXVIII.,of gems. My sands run out; by me hath this cruel promise been made with
9672,SECTION XXXVIII.,an oath. But this (exile of Sitā) has been thought of by you through
9673,SECTION XXXVIII.,"your ignorance! Let it not, however, consume you like a bamboo flower"
9674,SECTION XXXVIII.,"destroying the bamboo. If, O wicked woman, Rāma has happened to do thee"
9675,SECTION XXXVIII.,"something unbeautiful, what wrong, O base wretch, has Vaidehi done thee"
9676,SECTION XXXVIII.,"in the world? Of eyes expanded like those of a doe, endued with a mild"
9677,SECTION XXXVIII.,"temperament, and virtuous, what harm has Janaka’s daughter done thee."
9678,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Surely, O nefarious one, the banishment of Rāma is enough for thee. Why"
9679,SECTION XXXVIII.,then dost thou bend thy mind to perpetrate these atrocious sins? O noble
9680,SECTION XXXVIII.,"dame, having heard you asking for the banishment of Rāma, who had at"
9681,SECTION XXXVIII.,"first been intended by me for being installed, and who came here"
9682,SECTION XXXVIII.,"afterwards, I had promised you (his exile alone.) But since, going"
9683,SECTION XXXVIII.,"beyond that promise of mine, you behold Mithāla’s daughter dressed in"
9684,SECTION XXXVIII.,"mendicant garb, surely you wish to find your way to hell."" Thus"
9685,SECTION XXXVIII.,"commissioned to the forest, Rāma who was seated sealing his lips,"
9686,SECTION XXXVIII.,"said,—""O righteous one, this my mother is aged and famous and of a lofty"
9687,SECTION XXXVIII.,spirit. May she not meet with improper treatment at your hands! It
9688,SECTION XXXVIII.,"behoves you, O bestower of boons, to show greater honor to her when she"
9689,SECTION XXXVIII.,shall be deprived of me and be plunged into a sea of grief and afflicted
9690,SECTION XXXVIII.,"with unprecedented woe. O you comparable unto the mighty Indra, you"
9691,SECTION XXXVIII.,"should so behave with my mother smitten with my separation, that"
9692,SECTION XXXVIII.,"exercised by grief in consequence of my residence in the forest, she may"
9693,SECTION XXXVIII.,"not, renouncing life, repair to the mansions of Yama."""

9698,SECTION XXXIX.,
9699,SECTION XXXIX.,
9700,SECTION XXXIX.,"HEARING Rāma’s words, and seeing him dressed like an ascetic, the king"
9701,SECTION XXXIX.,in the midst of his wives was deprived of his senses. And burning in
9702,SECTION XXXIX.,"grief, the king could not eye Rāghava, nor seeing him could that one of"
9703,SECTION XXXIX.,"afflicted mind answer anything. Then remaining unconscious for a while,"
9704,SECTION XXXIX.,"the mighty-armed lord of earth oppressed by grief began to bewail,"
9705,SECTION XXXIX.,"thinking of Rāma. ""I conclude that formerly I deprived many a cow of her"
9706,SECTION XXXIX.,"calf, and took the life of many a creature, and it is for this that the"
9707,SECTION XXXIX.,present calamity has befallen me. (I infer) that life never departs from
9708,SECTION XXXIX.,"the body unless the time comes, for although sore tried by Kaikeyi, my"
9709,SECTION XXXIX.,"life does not go out of me, and for I can see before me this one"
9710,SECTION XXXIX.,"resembling fire, clad in the dress of an ascetic, having left his fine"
9711,SECTION XXXIX.,vesture. These people are in trouble in consequence of Kaikeyi alone
9712,SECTION XXXIX.,"striving by help of this craftiness to secure her interest."" Having said"
9713,SECTION XXXIX.,"these words, Daçarātha, his semes overpowered by the vapour of sorrow,"
9714,SECTION XXXIX.,"exclaimed ""Rāma!"" and could not proceed further. Then soon regaining"
9715,SECTION XXXIX.,"consciousness, the lord of earth with tearful eyes, addressed Sumuntra,"
9716,SECTION XXXIX.,"saying,—""Yoking a riding car with excellent horses, do you come hither;"
9717,SECTION XXXIX.,and take the exalted one to the south of the kingdom. The virtuous and
9718,SECTION XXXIX.,heroic Rāma is being banished by his father and mother. Even this
9719,SECTION XXXIX.,methinks will be asserted as the fruit of the virtues possessed by the
9720,SECTION XXXIX.,"pious."" Receiving the mandate of the sovereign, Sumantra endued with"
9721,SECTION XXXIX.,"fleet vigour, yoking a car adorned with horses, came there. Then the"
9722,SECTION XXXIX.,charioteer with joined hands announced to the prince that the car
9723,SECTION XXXIX.,"adorned with gold was ready, yoked with excellent horses. The king,"
9724,SECTION XXXIX.,"versed in time and place, and pure, speedily summoning his treasurer,"
9725,SECTION XXXIX.,"said unto him these words firmly,— ""Do you without delay bring unto"
9726,SECTION XXXIX.,"Vaidehi excellent and costly attires and noble ornaments, counting these"
9727,SECTION XXXIX.,"(ten and four) years."" Thus desired by the foremost of men, that officer"
9728,SECTION XXXIX.,"repairing to the treasury, procuring all those, speedily presented them"
9729,SECTION XXXIX.,"to Sitā. Thereupon that pure-sprung one, Vaidehi, ordered to the forest,"
9730,SECTION XXXIX.,"adorned her goodly limbs with those rare ornaments. And thus decked out,"
9731,SECTION XXXIX.,Vaidehi graced that chamber like the effulgence of the Sun irradiating
9732,SECTION XXXIX.,the welkin with his rays. Then embracing with her arms Mithilā’s
9733,SECTION XXXIX.,"daughter of noble behaviour, and smelling the crown of her head, Sitā’s"
9734,SECTION XXXIX.,"mother-in-law said,—""Those women that although having always been"
9735,SECTION XXXIX.,"carefully tended by their husbands, do not regard them during the"
9736,SECTION XXXIX.,"incident of adversity, are in this world reckoned as unchaste.—Even this"
9737,SECTION XXXIX.,is the nature of women: having formerly tasted happiness (at the hands
9738,SECTION XXXIX.,"of their husbands), they, on the accession of an inconsiderable"
9739,SECTION XXXIX.,"misfortune, take them to task,—nay, forsake them utterly. Those women"
9740,SECTION XXXIX.,"that are untruthful, unmindful, of evil ways, heartless, intent on"
9741,SECTION XXXIX.,"unrighteous acts, and whose love is evanescent, are unchaste. Neither"
9742,SECTION XXXIX.,"lineage, nor benefit, nor learning, nor gift, nor forbearance of faults,"
9743,SECTION XXXIX.,"can secure the hearts of females,—surely their hearts are unstable. But"
9744,SECTION XXXIX.,"chaste women of good character, abiding in truth, acting in accordance"
9745,SECTION XXXIX.,"with the precepts of superiors, and maintaining the dignity of their"
9746,SECTION XXXIX.,"race, single out their lords as the prime means of compassing their"
9747,SECTION XXXIX.,spiritual welfare. Therefore although my son is going to be banished to
9748,SECTION XXXIX.,"the woods, you should by no means disregard him. Whether he be wealthy"
9749,SECTION XXXIX.,"or poor, he is unto you like a god."" Hearing her mother-in- law’s words"
9750,SECTION XXXIX.,"fraught with virtue and interest, Sitā facing that lady, said with"
9751,SECTION XXXIX.,"joined palms,—""I will do all that the noble one says. I know how I"
9752,SECTION XXXIX.,should act by my husband. I have heard all about that (from my parents.)
9753,SECTION XXXIX.,The worshipful one ought not to place me on the same footing with
9754,SECTION XXXIX.,"unrighteous persons. As brightness doth not depart from the moon, so I"
9755,SECTION XXXIX.,cannot swerve from virtue. The Vinā without strings does not sound; and
9756,SECTION XXXIX.,"the car without wheels does not move,— so although having an hundred"
9757,SECTION XXXIX.,"sons, a woman without her husband cannot attain happiness. The Father"
9758,SECTION XXXIX.,"gives in measure, the father and the son give in measure,—but who does"
9759,SECTION XXXIX.,not worship that bestower of ’riches fineless’—the husband? O exalted
9760,SECTION XXXIX.,"one, having learnt from my superiors the principal as well the minor"
9761,SECTION XXXIX.,"duties, shall I disregard (my lord)? A husband is a deity unto the"
9762,SECTION XXXIX.,"wife."" Hearing Sitā’s words which went directly to the heart, Kauçalyā"
9763,SECTION XXXIX.,"endued with purity of spirit, out of fulness of bliss and bale suddenly"
9764,SECTION XXXIX.,shed tears. Then with joined hands that foremost of virtuous ones
9765,SECTION XXXIX.,"addressed his mother, who, duly honored by all, was seated in the midst"
9766,SECTION XXXIX.,"of his other mothers, saying,—""O mother, without indulging in grief, you"
9767,SECTION XXXIX.,should minister unto my father; and the term of my abode in the woods
9768,SECTION XXXIX.,will shortly expire. You will find these five and nine years pass away
9769,SECTION XXXIX.,"as if in a sleep. Then again, getting me,you will see me surrounded by"
9770,SECTION XXXIX.,"my friends and relatives."" Having spoken out his mind unto his mother,"
9771,SECTION XXXIX.,Rāma attentively eyed his three hundred and fifty mothers. And with
9772,SECTION XXXIX.,joined hands Daçarātha’s son spake words fraught with virtue unto his
9773,SECTION XXXIX.,"mothers afflicted like Kauçalyā herseH ""If I have said anything harsh to"
9774,SECTION XXXIX.,"you in consequence a familiarity, or done any wrong through ignorance,"
9775,SECTION XXXIX.,"do you forgive the same. I salute you all."" These calm words of Rāghava"
9776,SECTION XXXIX.,informed with piety were heard by the ladies overwhelmed with grief. As
9777,SECTION XXXIX.,"Rāghava was speaking thus, then arose a loud wail proceeding from those"
9778,SECTION XXXIX.,"wives of that chief of men, like unto the cries of Kraunchis. And the"
9779,SECTION XXXIX.,"aboA of Daçarātha which formerly resounded with _murajas_, _panavas_,"
9780,SECTION XXXIX.,"_meghas_,¹⁴¹ was now filled with cries of distress and lamentations."

9788,SECTION XL.,
9789,SECTION XL.,"Then exceedingly distressed, Rāma, Sitā and Lakshmana, bowing down unto"
9790,SECTION XL.,"the king, circumambulated him. Then with the king’s permission, the"
9791,SECTION XL.,"righteous Rāghava stupified with sorrow, in company with Sitā, paid"
9792,SECTION XL.,"respect unto his mother. Following his brother, Lakshmana saluted"
9793,SECTION XL.,Kauçalyā; then he again took hold of his mother Sumitrā’s feet. As the
9794,SECTION XL.,"son of Sumitrā, was thus engaged in honoring his mother, his mother"
9795,SECTION XL.,"smelling the crown of his head, thus spoke unto the mighty-armed"
9796,SECTION XL.,"Lakshmana,—""Although attached unto thy friends here, thou hast my"
9797,SECTION XL.,permission to go to the forest. When Rāma shall have gone (to the
9798,SECTION XL.,"woods), do not, O son, show any negligence unto him. O sinless one,"
9799,SECTION XL.,"whether in prosperity or in adversity, even this one is thy way. That a"
9800,SECTION XL.,younger brother should follow his elder is in this world the duty of the
9801,SECTION XL.,righteous. These are the legitimate duties ever observed by this
9802,SECTION XL.,"race—charity, initiation into sacrifice, and renunciation of the body in"
9803,SECTION XL.,"the field of battle. Do thou consider Rāma as Daçarātha, and Janaka’s"
9804,SECTION XL.,"own-begotten as myself; do thou regard Ayodhyā as a wilderness,—go my"
9805,SECTION XL.,"son, at thy sweet pleasure."" Having thus spoken unto that dear"
9806,SECTION XL.,"descendant of Raghu, who had made up his mind (to journey to the"
9807,SECTION XL.,"forest), Sumitrā, again and again said unto him,— ""Go! Go!"" Then like"
9808,SECTION XL.,"unto Mātali addressing Vāsava, that one understanding humility,"
9809,SECTION XL.,"Sumantra, with joined hands humbly said unto Kākutstha,—""O illustrious"
9810,SECTION XL.,"prince, good betide you: do you ascend the car. O Rāma, I will speedily"
9811,SECTION XL.,take you to wherever you will tell me. You will have to spend fourteen
9812,SECTION XL.,"years in the forest, and your stay must commence from this very day. So"
9813,SECTION XL.,"the noble lady has ordered."" Then having adorned her person, that best"
9814,SECTION XL.,"of her sex, Sitā, with a glad heart ascended the car resembling the sun."
9815,SECTION XL.,"Counting the term of their stay in the woods, her father-in-law"
9816,SECTION XL.,furnished Sitā following her lord with attires and ornaments. And then
9817,SECTION XL.,"he placed in front of the car various weapons, coats of mail, a basket"
9818,SECTION XL.,bound in hide and a hoe. At length the brothers Rāma and Lakshmana
9819,SECTION XL.,swiftly ascended the flaming car garnished with gold. And seeing them
9820,SECTION XL.,"with Sitā for the third, mounted, Sumantra drove the car yoked with"
9821,SECTION XL.,goodly horses resembling the wind in celerity. On Rāghava having left
9822,SECTION XL.,"for the forest to stay there for a long period, the men and beasts"
9823,SECTION XL.,within the city were deprived of their senses (by grief). And in the
9824,SECTION XL.,city there arose a mighty tumult in consequence of the hurrying of
9825,SECTION XL.,"people, the elephants waxing mad and furious, and the neighings of"
9826,SECTION XL.,"horses. And the entire city containing young and old, extremely"
9827,SECTION XL.,"afflicted, rushed after Rāma, like persons oppressed with the heat of"
9828,SECTION XL.,the sun rushing towards water.
9829,SECTION XL.,
9830,SECTION XL.,"At his side and back, the people bending forward with their faces"
9831,SECTION XL.,"covered with the vapour of grief, and sighing hard, said unto the"
9832,SECTION XL.,"charioteer,—""O charioteer, rein in the horses,—do thou proceed softly."
9833,SECTION XL.,"We will see the countenance of Rāma, which we shall never see again."
9834,SECTION XL.,"Surely the heart of Rāma’s mother is made of iron, for it does not burst"
9835,SECTION XL.,on witnessing her son resembling Skanda repairing to the forest.
9836,SECTION XL.,"Vaidehi, attaining her desire, follows her husband, like a"
9837,SECTION XL.,"shadow—attached to virtue, she does not forsake him even as the Sun"
9838,SECTION XL.,"forsakes not meru. O Lakshmana, you are blessed, since you will serve"
9839,SECTION XL.,your god-like brother ever speaking fair. This design of yours is great;
9840,SECTION XL.,this is your mighty good fortune; this the way to heaven that you are
9841,SECTION XL.,"following him."" Saying this, they could not supress their fears; and the"
9842,SECTION XL.,"men followed the beloved descendant of Ikshwāku. Then the king, his"
9843,SECTION XL.,"senses overcome by grief, surrounded by his distressed wives, went out"
9844,SECTION XL.,"of his house, saying—""I will behold my dear son."" He heard before him a"
9845,SECTION XL.,"mighty noise proceeding from weeping women, like unto the roars of"
9846,SECTION XL.,"she-elephants, when a great elephant has been taken captive. Thereupon"
9847,SECTION XL.,"Rāma’s father, the graceful Kākutstha, became shorn of his splendour,"
9848,SECTION XL.,like unto the full-moon enveloped at the appointed time during the

9851,SECTION XL.,"speedily Rāma saying unto the charioteer,—""Go,"" and the people,— ""Stay,"""
9852,SECTION XL.,"thus desired on the way, the charioteer could not act both ways at once."
9853,SECTION XL.,"As the mighty-armed Rāma proceeded, the dust of the earth raised by the"
9854,SECTION XL.,car-wheels were laid by the tears of the citizens showering down. And in
9855,SECTION XL.,"consequence of Rāghava’s departure, the entire city filled with despair,"
9856,SECTION XL.,"and uttering with their senses lost exclamations of ""Oh"" and ""Alas,"""
9857,SECTION XL.,became exceedingly afflicted. And the tears begot of heart’s grief that
9858,SECTION XL.,"flowed from the eyes of the females, resembled rain-drops scattered"
9859,SECTION XL.,around from lotuses shaken by the movements of fish. And beholding the
9860,SECTION XL.,"citizens absorbed in one thought, the auspicious monarch fell down in"
9861,SECTION XL.,grief like a tree whose roots have been severed. Then seeing the
9862,SECTION XL.,"sovereign senseless and stricken with exceeding sorrow, the multitudes"
9863,SECTION XL.,at the rear of Rāma broke out into a loud tumult. And seeing the king
9864,SECTION XL.,"weeping aloud with the inmates of the inner apartment, some exclaiming"
9865,SECTION XL.,"""Oh Rāma,"" and others, ""O Rāma’s mother,"" began to bewail. Then turning"
9866,SECTION XL.,"back, Rāma saw that his sorrow-stricken and bewildered father along with"
9867,SECTION XL.,"his mother, was following his track. As a colt fastened in a snare"
9868,SECTION XL.,"cannot see its mother, so Rāma fastened in the bonds of virtue could not"
9869,SECTION XL.,look at his mother openly. And seeing his parents deserving of comfort
9870,SECTION XL.,"and worthy of going in a carriage, going on foot, Rāma said unto the"
9871,SECTION XL.,"charioteer,—""Go thou swiftly."" And that foremost of men was incapable of"
9872,SECTION XL.,"bearing the looks of his father and mother, like unto an elephant"
9873,SECTION XL.,"afflicted with the hook, (not being able to look at what is placed on"
9874,SECTION XL.,its back.)
9875,SECTION XL.,
9876,SECTION XL.,Rāma’s mother rushed after him like a cow having a calf which has been
9877,SECTION XL.,"fettered, rushing towards the fold, for the purpose of seeing it. Rāma"
9878,SECTION XL.,"beheld his mother Kauçalyā running after the car, bewailing aloud,—"
9879,SECTION XL.,"""Rāma, Rāma, Ah Sitā, Lakshmana,"" shedding tears for Rāma, Lakshmana and"
9880,SECTION XL.,"Sitā, and appearing as if she had been dancing incessantly. The king"
9881,SECTION XL.,"exclaimed,—""Stay,"" Rāghava said,—""On, On."" Sumantra’s mind vascillated"
9882,SECTION XL.,like that of one placed between two hosts burning to encounter each
9883,SECTION XL.,"other. Rāma said unto him—""When taxed by the monarch (on your return),"
9884,SECTION XL.,"you will say, ’I did not hear you.’ But delay will impart me terrible"
9885,SECTION XL.,"pain."" Thereupon, doing Rāma’s bidding, the charioteer, telling the"
9886,SECTION XL.,"people to desist, made the horses already coursing, run faster. The"
9887,SECTION XL.,"retainers of the king stopped after circumambulating Rāma, but their"
9888,SECTION XL.,minds did not turn back. But the others did not return either bodily or
9889,SECTION XL.,"mentally. Then the courtiers said unto that mighty monarch,"
9890,SECTION XL.,"Daçarātha,—""He that is expected back should not be followed far."""
9891,SECTION XL.,"Hearing their words, the king endued with every virtue, with his body"
9892,SECTION XL.,"covered with perspiration and his countenance woe-begone, and exceeding"
9893,SECTION XL.,"distressed, stopped short and stood along with his wife looking at his"
9894,SECTION XL.,son.

9901,SECTION XLI.,"When that foremost of men had gone out of the city with joined hands,"
9902,SECTION XLI.,there arose a chorus of cries proceeding from the females residing in
9903,SECTION XLI.,"the inner apartment. ""Where goeth he that was the stay and refuge of the"
9904,SECTION XLI.,"friendless, the feeble, and the helpless? He that although falsely"
9905,SECTION XLI.,"accused, used not to be moved by anger, who pacified every enraged"
9906,SECTION XLI.,person by renouncing things calculated to fan anger and who felt equally
9907,SECTION XLI.,"for all, where goeth he? Where goeth that highly energetic and"
9908,SECTION XLI.,magnanimous one who conducted himself with us as he did with his mother
9909,SECTION XLI.,Kauçalyā? Afflicted by Kaikeyi and commissioned by the monarch unto the
9910,SECTION XLI.,"woods, where goeth the deliverer of these people—of the entire world?"
9911,SECTION XLI.,Ah! the senseless monarch is sending to the woods the stay of all
9912,SECTION XLI.,"creatures—the righteous and truthful Rāma."" Thus all the queens,"
9913,SECTION XLI.,"oppressed with grief, burst out into lamentations like kine bereft of"
9914,SECTION XLI.,"calves, and loud was the sound of their wailing. Hearing the loud tumult"
9915,SECTION XLI.,"of lamentation in the inner apartment, the lord of earth burning in"
9916,SECTION XLI.,grief for his son was striken with sorrow. And oblations unto the fire
9917,SECTION XLI.,had not been offered; and the Sun set; and elephants forsook their
9918,SECTION XLI.,"forage; and the kine did not suckle their calves. Trisanku, Lohitānga,"
9919,SECTION XLI.,"Vrihashpati, Budha and the other Grahas getting at the Moon, remained"
9920,SECTION XLI.,with fierce aspects. The stars are shorn of their brightness; the Grahas
9921,SECTION XLI.,deprived of sheen; and Viçakhā appeareth enveloped in haze. And clouds
9922,SECTION XLI.,driven by the wind resembled the sea mounting the welkin; and the city
9923,SECTION XLI.,shook on Rāma having departed for the forest. And the cardinal points
9924,SECTION XLI.,"are distressed, and appear enveloped in darkness. And no planet or star"
9925,SECTION XLI.,is to be seen. And all of a sudden the citizens have been striken with
9926,SECTION XLI.,poverty: and no one turns his thoughts to eating or drinking. And
9927,SECTION XLI.,"ceaselessly burning in grief and heaving sighs, the people in Ayodhyā"
9928,SECTION XLI.,"rage at the monarch. And with their faces washed in tears, the wayfarers"
9929,SECTION XLI.,"betoken no delight, but all are being exercised with grief. And the cool"
9930,SECTION XLI.,"air does not blow, and no moon of mild appearance is seen, and no sun"
9931,SECTION XLI.,"heats the world, all the entire Earth is overwhelmed with woe. And sons"
9932,SECTION XLI.,"depend not upon their parents, hurbands on their wives, and brothers on"
9933,SECTION XLI.,"brothers; and all forsaking each other, think of Rāma only. And deprived"
9934,SECTION XLI.,"of sense, and oppressed by the load of sorrow, the friends of Rāma"
9935,SECTION XLI.,forsook their rest. Like the Earth with her mountains bereft of
9936,SECTION XLI.,"Purandara, Ayodhyā, bereft of Rāma, shook, agitated by fear and grief;"
9937,SECTION XLI.,and the citizens with elephants and warriors uttered exclamations of

9946,SECTION XLII.,"for the forest, so long that best of the Ikshwāku race did not turn his"
9947,SECTION XLII.,eyes from that direction. And so long as the king could discover his
9948,SECTION XLII.,"exceedingly virtuous and favorite son, so long he raised himself (on his"
9949,SECTION XLII.,toes) on the earth with the view of beholding him. And when the ruler of
9950,SECTION XLII.,"earth could no longer perceive even the dust raised by Rāma’s car, then"
9951,SECTION XLII.,"pierced with sorrow, and in heaviness of heart, he fell down to the"
9952,SECTION XLII.,"ground. Then (raising him up), Kauçalyā held his right arm and walked"
9953,SECTION XLII.,"with him, while the slender-waisted Kaikeyi walked by his left. Endowed"
9954,SECTION XLII.,"with a sense of justice and with virtue and humility, the king with"
9955,SECTION XLII.,"afflicted senses steadily eyeing Kaikeyi, thus spake unto her,—""O"
9956,SECTION XLII.,"Kaikeyi, that hast decided for following sin, do thou not touch my"
9957,SECTION XLII.,"person,—nor do I wish to see thee. Thou art no wife of mine—not even a"
9958,SECTION XLII.,maid-servant of a friend sharing his good graces. I am none to those
9959,SECTION XLII.,"that subsist on thy favour, nor are they anything to me. I renounce thee"
9960,SECTION XLII.,who solely seekest thy interest and hast abandoned virtue. I renounce
9961,SECTION XLII.,all the advantages pertaining either to this world or the next which I
9962,SECTION XLII.,am entitled to by virtue of having obtained thy hand and having made
9963,SECTION XLII.,thee circumambulate the sacrifical fire. If Bharata is satisfied with
9964,SECTION XLII.,"receiving this entire kingdom, let not what he spends on account of my"
9965,SECTION XLII.,"funeral obsequies find its way to me."" Then raising the lord of men"
9966,SECTION XLII.,"covered with dust, the noble Kauçalyā pierced with grief, stopped (along"
9967,SECTION XLII.,with the monarch). The righteous one remembering Rāghava repented
9968,SECTION XLII.,"himself, as if he had slain a Brāhmana through inordinate desire, or as"
9969,SECTION XLII.,"if he had placed his hand in fire. And having stopped again and again,"
9970,SECTION XLII.,"the visage of the monarch lamenting on beholding the track of the car,"
9971,SECTION XLII.,"appeared dim like the Moon invaded by Rāhu. And stricken with grief, he"
9972,SECTION XLII.,"lamented, remembering his beloved son; and thinking that by this time he"
9973,SECTION XLII.,"had reached the precincts of the city, he broke out into the"
9974,SECTION XLII.,"following,—""On the way are traced the foot-prints of those foremost of"
9975,SECTION XLII.,bearers that are carrying my son away; but that magnanimous one I do not
9976,SECTION XLII.,"find. And that meritorious son of mine, who, doubed with sandal, used to"
9977,SECTION XLII.,"rest his head pleasantly upon a pillow, fanned by beauteous damsels"
9978,SECTION XLII.,"decked in ornaments, will to-day surely take refuge underneath a tree,"
9979,SECTION XLII.,"and lay his head on a wooden plank or a stone. Covered with dust, he"
9980,SECTION XLII.,"heaving sighs will rise from the ground in sad guise, like a leader of"
9981,SECTION XLII.,she-elephants rising from the side of a mountain. The rangers of the
9982,SECTION XLII.,woods will now see the long-armed Rāma resembling the lord himself of
9983,SECTION XLII.,"the worlds, rising from the ground and going like one forlorn. And that"
9984,SECTION XLII.,"one so dearly loved by Janaka, worthy of being constantly ministered"
9985,SECTION XLII.,"unto with comforts, is to-day going to the forest, fatigued in"
9986,SECTION XLII.,consequence of having been pierced with thorns. Unacquainted with the
9987,SECTION XLII.,"forest, she is certainly afflicted with fright on hearing the deep roars"
9988,SECTION XLII.,"of ferocious beasts, capable of making one’s hair stand erect. O"
9989,SECTION XLII.,"Kaikeyi, do thou realize thy desire,—do thou becoming a widow, rule this"
9990,SECTION XLII.,"kingdom. Without that best of men I cannot live."" Thus lamenting, the"
9991,SECTION XLII.,"king surrounded by the multitude, like one that had performed his bath"
9992,SECTION XLII.,"after death, entered that best of cities filled with people enfeebled"
9993,SECTION XLII.,"and smitten with grief, with its streets thined of men and its stalls"
9994,SECTION XLII.,"closed. And beholding that entire city, with his mind fixed upon Rāma,"
9995,SECTION XLII.,"the king lamenting, like unto the sun entering clouds, entered that city"
9996,SECTION XLII.,"like unto an unagitated sea rid of serpents by Suparna,¹⁴² the city"
9997,SECTION XLII.,"without Rāma or Lakshmana or Sitā. Then with tears in his eyes, the lord"
9998,SECTION XLII.,"of earth, lamenting, in unintelligible accents said these sad and broken"
9999,SECTION XLII.,"words,—""Do you speedily take me to the room of Rāma’s mother, Kauçalyā;"
10000,SECTION XLII.,"for in no other place shall I find rest for my heart."" When the king had"
10001,SECTION XLII.,"spoken thus, the ushers taking him to Kauçalyā’s chamber, made him lie"
10002,SECTION XLII.,"down in lowly plight. And having entered Kauçalyā’s apartment, the king"
10003,SECTION XLII.,"having laid himself on the bed, was overwhelmed with emotion. And the"
10004,SECTION XLII.,king surveyed the mansion deprived of his two sons as well as his
10005,SECTION XLII.,"daughter-in-law, like unto the welkin deprived of the Moon. Beholding"
10006,SECTION XLII.,"this, the puissant sovereign raising up his arm, burst out into"
10007,SECTION XLII.,"lamentations, saying,— ""Ah! Rāma, thou forsakest us both! Ah me! surely"
10008,SECTION XLII.,"those blessed people are happy, who having passed this gap of time, will"
10009,SECTION XLII.,"behold Rāma returned and will embrace him."" Then when the night had come"
10010,SECTION XLII.,"like unto his own fatal night, Daçarātha at mid-night addressed Kauçalyā"
10011,SECTION XLII.,"saying,—""I do not perceive thee, O Kauçalyā. Do thou touch me with thy"
10012,SECTION XLII.,"hand. My sight having followed Rāma doth not return yet."" Then seeing"
10013,SECTION XLII.,"that foremost of men absorbed in the contemplation of Rāma, that noble"
10014,SECTION XLII.,"dame sat by him, and afflicted with greater grief, began to indulge a"
10015,SECTION XLII.,"sorrow,¹⁴³ sighing heavily."

10029,SECTION XLIII.,"having vented her venom upon Rāghava, the crooked Kaikeyi will go about"
10030,SECTION XLIII.,like a she- serpent that has cast off her slough. And that fortunate one
10031,SECTION XLIII.,"having by her endeavours attained her end, will frighten me the more"
10032,SECTION XLIII.,like a wicked serpent in one’s house. If Rāma had stayed in this city
10033,SECTION XLIII.,"subsisting himself by alms, or had I made my son as Kaikeyi’s slave,"
10034,SECTION XLIII.,even that would have been preferable (before his retirement to the
10035,SECTION XLIII.,woods). Like unto the sacrificial share cast unto the Rākshasas by the
10036,SECTION XLIII.,"sacrificers on the occasions of Parvas, that wielder of the bow, the"
10037,SECTION XLIII.,"mighty-armed Rāma, gifted with the gait of the prince of elephants, cast"
10038,SECTION XLIII.,"off by Kaikeyi, takes refuge in the forest in company with his wife and"

10040,SECTION XLIII.,"what a plight will they, not inured to the privations of a forest-life,"

10043,SECTION XLIII.,subsisting on fruits and roots! Will such a time present itself now that
10044,SECTION XLIII.,"my grief removed and my desire attained, I shall here behold Rāghava"
10045,SECTION XLIII.,"along with his wife and brother? When, hearing that those heroes have"
10046,SECTION XLIII.,"come, will Ayodhyā adorned with standards and garlands, attain fame,"
10047,SECTION XLIII.,"with her populace filled with joy? When, seeing those foremost of men"
10048,SECTION XLIII.,"returned from the forest, will the city overflow with delight, like the"
10049,SECTION XLIII.,ocean on the occasion of a Parva? When will the mighty-armed hero enter
10050,SECTION XLIII.,"the city of Ayodhyā, placing Sitā"" before him on the car,—like unto a"
10051,SECTION XLIII.,bull having his bovine mate before him? When will people by thousands
10052,SECTION XLIII.,"shower fried paddy upon my sons on the road, as those repressors of foes"
10053,SECTION XLIII.,will enter the city? When shall I behold those (two) wearing burnished
10054,SECTION XLIII.,"ear-rings, entering Ayodhyā, placing before them their weapons and"
10055,SECTION XLIII.,"swords, like unto two hills furnished with their summits? When accepting"
10056,SECTION XLIII.,"flowers from girls and fruits from Brāhmanas, will they, filled with"
10057,SECTION XLIII.,"delight, go round the palace? When with his intelligence ripened by"
10058,SECTION XLIII.,"time, although resembling a celestial in age, will that righteous-souled"
10059,SECTION XLIII.,"one come here, rejoicing people like a _Trivarsha_?¹⁴⁴ Doubtless, O"
10060,SECTION XLIII.,"hero, formerly of vile ways that I was, I had cut off the paps of kine"
10061,SECTION XLIII.,"and thus prevented their calves hungering after their mothers’ milk,"
10062,SECTION XLIII.,"from drinking it. And it is for this sin that, O foremost of men, have"
10063,SECTION XLIII.,"I, attached to my son, been forcibly deprived of him by Kaikeyi, like a"
10064,SECTION XLIII.,"cow deprived of her calf by a lion. Having an only son, I dare not live"
10065,SECTION XLIII.,without him endowed with every virtue and versed in every branch of

10100,SECTION XLIV.,"that foremost of the Dānavas, the son of Timidhwaja, slain in"
10101,SECTION XLIV.,"battle,—that tiger-like one, relying on the native strength of his arms,"

10103,SECTION XLIV.,should not the earth remain in the sway of him coming within the range
10104,SECTION XLIV.,"of whose arms enemies find destruction? Considering Rāma’s grace,"
10105,SECTION XLIV.,"heroism and auspiciousness, (there cannot be any doubt that) returning"
10106,SECTION XLIV.,"from the forest, he will speedily regain his own kingdom. He is the sun"

10111,SECTION XLIV.,"in the forest? And that best of men, Rāma, will soon be installed in the"
10112,SECTION XLIV.,"kingdom, in company with these three— the Earth, Vaidehi, and the"
10113,SECTION XLIV.,"goddess of victory. Although overwhelmed with grief, the people of"

10118,SECTION XLIV.,"goeth that foremost of bowmen himself bearing arrows, swords and other"

10120,SECTION XLIV.,"chase your grief and sadness, I tell you this truly. O blameless one,"
10121,SECTION XLIV.,"you will again, O auspicious lady, see your son, like onto the new-risen"

10130,SECTION XLIV.,"Beholding your son surrounded by his friends, bowing unto you, you will"

10156,SECTION XLV.,"inhabitants of Ayodhyā have for me, let them, for pleasing me, extend in"
10157,SECTION XLV.,full measure towards Bharata. That enhancer of Kaikeyi’s delight bearing
10158,SECTION XLV.,"an auspicious character, will duly compass your happiness and welfare."
10159,SECTION XLV.,"Aged by virtue of his wisdom, although young in years, and mild albeit"
10160,SECTION XLV.,"furnished with heroic virtue, that remover of fear will make a fit ruler"
10161,SECTION XLV.,for ye. Crowned with every regal virtue and selected as the
10162,SECTION XLV.,"heir-apparent (by the monarch), he is more meritorious by far than I am."
10163,SECTION XLV.,"It behoves ye to obey the order of your master. And seeking my good, it"
10164,SECTION XLV.,"behoves ye to act so that when I shall have gone to the forest, the king"
10165,SECTION XLV.,"may not grieve."" But as Daçarātha’s son was bringing home to the people"
10166,SECTION XLV.,"that their duty lay in obeying the royal mandate, they desired that even"
10167,SECTION XLV.,Rāma should rule them. And Rāma in company with Sumitrā’s son attracted
10168,SECTION XLV.,"the inhabitants of the city subdued by his virtues, who stood with tears"
10169,SECTION XLV.,"in their eyes. And the three kinds of the twice born ones, viz., those"
10170,SECTION XLV.,"old by virtue, respectively, of age, wisdom, and ascetic energy, the old"
10171,SECTION XLV.,"folks with their heads shaking through length of years,—cried from a"
10172,SECTION XLV.,"distance,—""O ye fleet coursers boasting of exalted extraction that bear"
10173,SECTION XLV.,"Rāma away, do ye desist,—do not go; do ye do even what is for the good"
10174,SECTION XLV.,of your master. And more particularly being creatures furnished with
10175,SECTION XLV.,"ears, do ye, ye horses, knowing our prayer, desist. And pure of spirit"
10176,SECTION XLV.,"and heroic and ever firm in noble promises, that master of yours should"
10177,SECTION XLV.,in justice be carried (unto the city) and not unto the forest away from
10178,SECTION XLV.,"it."" Suddenly seeing those old Brāhmanas thus lamenting distressfully,"
10179,SECTION XLV.,"Rāma speedily descended from his car. And along with Lakshmana and Sitā,"
10180,SECTION XLV.,"Rāma bound for the forest, began to walk near them on foot. Endowed with"
10181,SECTION XLV.,"kindness, that friend of the good, Rāma, could not by proceeding on his"
10182,SECTION XLV.,car bear to part with the Brāhmanas that were following on foot. Seeing
10183,SECTION XLV.,"him thus going, the Brāhmanas with agitated hearts, and burning in"
10184,SECTION XLV.,"grief, addressed Rāma in these words,—""The Brāhmanas in a body are"
10185,SECTION XLV.,"following thee ever seeking their good, and mounting on the shoulders of"
10186,SECTION XLV.,"the regenerate ones, the (sacrificial) Fires are walking in thy wake."
10187,SECTION XLV.,And behold these raised umbrellas of ours got from the Vājapeya
10188,SECTION XLV.,"sacrifice, that like unto autumnal clouds follow at your back. With"
10189,SECTION XLV.,"these umbrellas got at the Vājapeya sacrifice, we will afford shade unto"
10190,SECTION XLV.,"Rāma destitute of his own white umbrella, when he shall feel the heat of"
10191,SECTION XLV.,the (solar) rays. That intelligence of ours which ever followeth the
10192,SECTION XLV.,"Vedic Mantras, is now, O child, ready to follow thee unto the forest in"
10193,SECTION XLV.,"thy interests. That best of treasures, the Vedas, resides in our bosoms;"
10194,SECTION XLV.,and our wives protected by their chastity abide in our homes. As we have
10195,SECTION XLV.,"already made up our minds to follow thee, it is useless to fix our"
10196,SECTION XLV.,"hearts afresh. But if thou overlookest virtue, what becomes of abiding"
10197,SECTION XLV.,"by righteousness?¹⁴⁵ O thou that art ever firm in virtue, we beseech"
10198,SECTION XLV.,thee by humbling unto the dust our heads covered with hair white like
10199,SECTION XLV.,"cranes, do thou desist. These numerous Brāhmanas that have come hither"
10200,SECTION XLV.,"have entered upon many a sacrifice. The completion of these, O child,"
10201,SECTION XLV.,depends upon thy return. All creatures mobile and immobile cherish thee
10202,SECTION XLV.,with high regard. All these beseech thee. Do thou show consideration
10203,SECTION XLV.,unto those that regard thee. Tall trees deprived of motion in
10204,SECTION XLV.,consequence of being fast rooted to the earth and incapable of following
10205,SECTION XLV.,"thee, are prohibiting thee by sounding with the wind. And birds staying"
10206,SECTION XLV.,upon trees and neither manifesting any motion nor seeking for their
10207,SECTION XLV.,"food, beseech thee to have compassion upon all creatures."" While the"
10208,SECTION XLV.,"Brāhmanas were loudly demanding the return of Rāma, he found the"
10209,SECTION XLV.,darkness to descend as if forbidding him. Then Sumantra unyoked the
10210,SECTION XLV.,"fatigued horses from the car, which at once fell to rolling in the dust."
10211,SECTION XLV.,"And then bathing them and making then drink, he soon as the dusk set in,"
10212,SECTION XLV.,set fare before them.
10213,SECTION XLV.,
10214,SECTION XLV.,¹⁴⁵ Another reading is; _What becomes of the virtue that we expect at
10215,SECTION XLV.,thy hands?_— T.

10219,SECTION XLVI.,SECTION XLVI.
10220,SECTION XLVI.,
10221,SECTION XLVI.,
10222,SECTION XLVI.,"Then Rāghava pausing on the banks of the Tamasā, looked at Sitā and"
10223,SECTION XLVI.,"spake unto Sumitrā’s son, saying,— ""O son of Sumitrā, this is the first"
10224,SECTION XLVI.,"night of our exile into the forest. From this day it behoveth thee not,"
10225,SECTION XLVI.,"good betide thee, to suffer thy mind to grieve (by dwelling on past"
10226,SECTION XLVI.,joys.) The empty forest resounding with the cries of beasts and birds
10227,SECTION XLVI.,"returned to their abodes, and covered with gloom, seems to weep on all"
10228,SECTION XLVI.,"sides. Doubtless to-day the men and women of Ayodhyā, the metropolis of"
10229,SECTION XLVI.,"my father, are bewailing us retired to the forest. O foremost of men,"
10230,SECTION XLVI.,"the people are attached unto thyself, the monarch, Bliarata, Satrughna,"
10231,SECTION XLVI.,"and myself, because of our various good qualities. I bewail our father"
10232,SECTION XLVI.,"as well as my illustrious mother. I fear lest lamenting ceaselessly,"
10233,SECTION XLVI.,they become blind. But surely the virtuous Bharata will console our
10234,SECTION XLVI.,"father and mother with words fraught with virtue, interest and profit."
10235,SECTION XLVI.,"Reflecting again and again on Bharata’s sincerity of soul, I do not, O"
10236,SECTION XLVI.,"mighty- armed one, bewail either my mother or my father. O foremost of"
10237,SECTION XLVI.,"men, that thou hast followed me is what is thy duty. (If thou hadest not"
10238,SECTION XLVI.,"done so), I should have to seek elsewhere for the protection of Vaidehi."
10239,SECTION XLVI.,"O Sumitrā’s son, I will spend here this night, subsisting on water"
10240,SECTION XLVI.,"alone. Even this recommends itself unto me, although the forest yields"
10241,SECTION XLVI.,"various kinds of fruits."" Having said this unto Sumitrā’s son, Rāghava"
10242,SECTION XLVI.,"spake unto Sumantra, saying,—""O mild one, do thou now needfully tend the"
10243,SECTION XLVI.,"horses."" Then at sunset, fastening the horses, Sumantra fed them"
10244,SECTION XLVI.,"plentifully with grass, and then came back. Then seeing the night"
10245,SECTION XLVI.,"arrived, the charioteer worshipped the beneficent Sandhyā, and then in"
10246,SECTION XLVI.,"company with Sumitrā’s son, prepared Rāma’s bed. And looking at that bed"
10247,SECTION XLVI.,"on the shores of the Tamasā surrounded by trees, Rāma along with his"
10248,SECTION XLVI.,"wife and the son of Sumitrā, lay down. When Lakshmana found that Rāma"
10249,SECTION XLVI.,"afflicted with fatigue had slept together with his spouse, he began to"
10250,SECTION XLVI.,speak unto the charioteer concerning the various qualities of Rāma. As
10251,SECTION XLVI.,"remaining awake in the night, Sumitrā’s son was engaged in expatiating"
10252,SECTION XLVI.,"to the charioteer on the virtues of Rāma on the banks of the Tamasā, the"
10253,SECTION XLVI.,sun arose.
10254,SECTION XLVI.,
10255,SECTION XLVI.,Rāma abode that night along with the subjects at some distance from the
10256,SECTION XLVI.,"banks of the Tamasā filled with kine. Rising (from his bed), that highly"
10257,SECTION XLVI.,"energetic one, Rāma, viewing the subjects (asleep), addressed his"
10258,SECTION XLVI.,"brother Lakshmana graced with auspicious marks,—""O son of Sumitrā, these"
10259,SECTION XLVI.,"for our sake have disregarded their own homes, are asleep beneath the"
10260,SECTION XLVI.,trees. These citizens have determined upon making me turn back from the
10261,SECTION XLVI.,"forest,— they would rather renounce their lives than give up their"
10262,SECTION XLVI.,"resolve. Let us while they are asleep ascending on our car, swiftly go"
10263,SECTION XLVI.,"our way without fear of molestation. Attached to me, the denizons of"
10264,SECTION XLVI.,Ikshwāku’s city will not again indulge in sleep underneath trees. A
10265,SECTION XLVI.,prince should deliver citizens from the calamity they bring upon
10266,SECTION XLVI.,themselves; but he should by no means drag them into those which he
10267,SECTION XLVI.,"himself has brought on."" Then Lakshmana spake unto Rāma like unto"
10268,SECTION XLVI.,"manifest Virtue on earth,—""O wise one, even this is relished also by me."
10269,SECTION XLVI.,"Do you speedily ascend (the car.)"" Rāma said unto the charioteer,—""Do"
10270,SECTION XLVI.,"thou at once yoke the car. I will repair to the forest. Do thou, my"
10271,SECTION XLVI.,"master, swiftly go hence."" Thereupon the charioteer bestirring himself,"
10272,SECTION XLVI.,"yoking the excellent horses unto the car, said unto Rāma with joined"
10273,SECTION XLVI.,"hands,— ""Here, O mighty-armed one, is your car ready yoked, O foremost"
10274,SECTION XLVI.,"of car-warriors. Do you speedily ascend, good betide you, along with"
10275,SECTION XLVI.,"Sitā and Lakshmana."" Ascending the car after equipping himself, Rāghava"
10276,SECTION XLVI.,crossed the rapidly- rushing Tamasā abounding in eddies. Having crossed
10277,SECTION XLVI.,"(the stream), the auspicious and mighty-armed one came upon a safe and"
10278,SECTION XLVI.,goodly high way capable of inspiring even timid people with confidence.
10279,SECTION XLVI.,"But with the view of deluding the citizens, Rāma said unto the"
10280,SECTION XLVI.,"charioteer.—""0 charioteer, do thou ascending the car proceed northwards;"
10281,SECTION XLVI.,"and having proceeded swiftly for a while, do thou turn the car. Do thou"
10282,SECTION XLVI.,"carefully act so that the citizens may not perceive this."" Hearing"
10283,SECTION XLVI.,"Rāma’s words, the charioteer did accordingly. and having returned said"
10284,SECTION XLVI.,unto Rāma to ascend the car.
10285,SECTION XLVI.,
10286,SECTION XLVI.,Then on those perpetuators of the Raghu race having along with Sitā been
10287,SECTION XLVI.,"seated on the car, the charioteer drove the horses by that road which"
10288,SECTION XLVI.,conducted to the hermitage. Then placing the car with its face
10289,SECTION XLVI.,"northwards for the purpose of invoking auspiciousness on their journey,"
10290,SECTION XLVI.,"that mighty charioteer, Daçarātha’s son, established on the vehicle, set"
10291,SECTION XLVI.,out for the forest.

10298,SECTION XLVII.,"When the night had departed and day dawned, the citizens not finding"
10299,SECTION XLVII.,"Rāghava, were overwhelmed with grief and were deprived of their senses."
10300,SECTION XLVII.,"With tears of grief and afflicted with distress, they looked hither and"
10301,SECTION XLVII.,"thither, but they could not discover even the dust raised by Rāma’s car."
10302,SECTION XLVII.,"And those intelligent ones, extremely distressed on being deprived of"
10303,SECTION XLVII.,"Rāma endowed with understanding, with countenances betokening sorrow,"
10304,SECTION XLVII.,"spoke these piteous words,— ""Oh! fie on that sleep through which having"
10305,SECTION XLVII.,"been deprived of senses, we shall not to-day behold Rāma of broad chest"
10306,SECTION XLVII.,"and mighty arms. How could Rāma of mighty arms, resorting to this"
10307,SECTION XLVII.,"undesirable course, has gone into exile as an ascetic, leaving behind"
10308,SECTION XLVII.,"those that regard him dearly? Why has that foremost of Raghus, who has"
10309,SECTION XLVII.,always cherished us even as a father cherishes his sons begot by his own
10310,SECTION XLVII.,"loins, forsaking us, betaken himself to the forest? Here will we either"
10311,SECTION XLVII.,"renounce our lives, or direct our course to the north to meet death. Of"
10312,SECTION XLVII.,"what good are our lives, when we have been deprived of Rāma? There are"
10313,SECTION XLVII.,huge trunks of dry wood to be got here in plenty. Lighting the pile of
10314,SECTION XLVII.,woods will we all enter the fire. What shall we say (when people ask
10315,SECTION XLVII.,"us?) How can we say,—’We took hence the mighty-armed, sweet-speeched and"
10316,SECTION XLVII.,"unavenging Rāma’? Surely seeing us without Rāghava, the forlorn city"
10317,SECTION XLVII.,"with her women, children and grown up folks will be plunged in grid We"
10318,SECTION XLVII.,"had issued with that high-souled hero. Deprived of him, how shall we"
10319,SECTION XLVII.,"behold that city?"" Thus raising up their arms, they stricken with grief,"
10320,SECTION XLVII.,"indulged in lamentations, like unto kine deprived of their calves.—Then"
10321,SECTION XLVII.,"following for a while the track of the car, they, missing the track,"
10322,SECTION XLVII.,become overwhelmed with woe. And then those intelligent ones came back
10323,SECTION XLVII.,"by the track of the car. ""What is this? What shall we do? We have been"
10324,SECTION XLVII.,"foiled by some supernatural agency."" Then they returned to the city of"
10325,SECTION XLVII.,"Ayodhyā with its good people oppressed with grief, by the self-same way"
10326,SECTION XLVII.,"by which they had come. Viewing the city, they with their eyes weighed"
10327,SECTION XLVII.,"down with grief, and minds oppressed with woe, shed plentiful tears."
10328,SECTION XLVII.,"""This city deprived of Rāma does not look beautiful, like a lake bereft"
10329,SECTION XLVII.,"of its serpent by Garura, or the firmament deprived of the Moon, or the"
10330,SECTION XLVII.,"ocean without its waters."" And they disturbed in mind beheld the city"
10331,SECTION XLVII.,"sunk in sorrow. And entering their wealthy mansions, they deprived of"
10332,SECTION XLVII.,"their senses by grief, could not recognize them for their own, nor could"
10333,SECTION XLVII.,"they with their hearts rendered absolutely cheerless, although looking"

10338,SECTION XLVIII.,SECTION XLVIII.

10341,SECTION XLVIII.,"THEN with depressed spirits, and exceedingly afflicted, with tears"
10342,SECTION XLVIII.,"flooding their eyes, smitten with mortal grief, the inhabitants of the"
10343,SECTION XLVIII.,city went back from Rāma unto the city. And with their lives appearing
10344,SECTION XLVIII.,"as ready to go out, those unsteady ones came to their respective homes,"
10345,SECTION XLVIII.,"and surrounded by their wives and sons, washed their faces with copious"
10346,SECTION XLVIII.,"tears. And they forgot to rejoice or make merry, and the traders did not"
10347,SECTION XLVIII.,"spread (their stores), and stalls did not grace the place, and the"
10348,SECTION XLVIII.,"householders drd not cook, and people did not rejoice on recovering lost"

10351,SECTION XLVIII.,"females afflicted with woe, weeping chid their husbands, coming home,"
10352,SECTION XLVIII.,"with the following words as (drivers) spur elephants with hooks, ""Of"
10353,SECTION XLVIII.,"what use are their houses, and wives, and wealth, and sons, and"
10354,SECTION XLVIII.,"comforts, to those who see not Rāghava (in their midst?) There is one"
10355,SECTION XLVIII.,"only good man in this world even Lakshmana, who along with Sitā is"
10356,SECTION XLVIII.,"following Kākutstha Rāma unto the woods. Those streams, assemblage of"
10357,SECTION XLVIII.,"lotuses, and pools are blessed, by which bathing in the sacred waters,"
10358,SECTION XLVIII.,"Kākutstha will pass. And romantic forests and woods, watery expanses of"
10359,SECTION XLVIII.,"mighty volume, and mountains with flat spaces, will grace Kākutstha. And"
10360,SECTION XLVIII.,forests and hills to which will repair Rāma cannot go without paying him
10361,SECTION XLVIII.,homage like unto a welcome guest. And crested with flowers of various
10362,SECTION XLVIII.,"hues and putting forth frequent shoots, trees, swarming with bees will"
10363,SECTION XLVIII.,show themselves unto Rāghava. And hills from regard will show unto Rāma
10364,SECTION XLVIII.,arrived there the choicest flowers and fruits even out of season; and
10365,SECTION XLVIII.,will supply him with fountains of pure water. And presenting him with
10366,SECTION XLVIII.,"many a charming fountain, trees will delight Rāma at the tops of"
10367,SECTION XLVIII.,"mountains.¹⁴⁶ Where Rāma is, there is not fear or failure. That mighty-"
10368,SECTION XLVIII.,armed son of Daçarātha is heroic. Let us while he is yet ahead within a
10369,SECTION XLVIII.,"short distance of us, follow Rāghava. Even the shadow of the feet of our"
10370,SECTION XLVIII.,"master, so high-souled, would, bring us happiness. He is the lord of all"
10371,SECTION XLVIII.,these—he is the refuge—he is the accomplishment of our religious duties.
10372,SECTION XLVIII.,"We and you, will serve Sitā, and Rāghava."" Thus afflicted with grief,"
10373,SECTION XLVIII.,"the women of the city spake unto their husbands. ""In the forest Rāghava"
10374,SECTION XLVIII.,will attain for you the unattainable and protect what is attained; and
10375,SECTION XLVIII.,Sitā being a female will do the same for these (women.) Who will take
10376,SECTION XLVIII.,"pleasure in residing in a dwelling where the heart dies within itself,"
10377,SECTION XLVIII.,"which is devoid of delight, where the people are always agitated with"
10378,SECTION XLVIII.,anxiety and which is exceedingly disagreeable? If this kingdom devolves
10379,SECTION XLVIII.,on Kaikeyi it will be divested of all virtues and will be like unto one
10380,SECTION XLVIII.,"without a master. And of what avail then is our life itself, not to"
10381,SECTION XLVIII.,"speak of sons and wealth. Whom else will that stainer of her line,"
10382,SECTION XLVIII.,"Kaikeyi, forsake now, who for the sake of wealth has forsaken her son"
10383,SECTION XLVIII.,"and her lord? We swear by our sons that so long as Kaikeyi is alive, we"
10384,SECTION XLVIII.,"living will never stay in her kingdom, although we may be maintained by"
10385,SECTION XLVIII.,her. What happiness can be ours by living with that wicked and
10386,SECTION XLVIII.,unrighteous one who lost to every sense of shame is bent upon exiling
10387,SECTION XLVIII.,"the son of the foremost of kings? Troubled by disturbances, with all its"
10388,SECTION XLVIII.,"sacrifices stopped, and having no master over it, the entire (kingdom)"
10389,SECTION XLVIII.,will meet with destruction because of Kaikeyi. On Rāma retiring to the
10390,SECTION XLVIII.,"forest, the lord of earth will surely not live; and Daçarātha dying, it"
10391,SECTION XLVIII.,"is evident everything will come to naught. Do you, your virtue"
10392,SECTION XLVIII.,"exhausted, and oppressed with grief pounding poison, take it or follow"
10393,SECTION XLVIII.,"Rāghava, or remove to such a place that the very name of Kaikeyi may not"
10394,SECTION XLVIII.,reach your ears? Rāma has been deceitfully exiled along with his wife
10395,SECTION XLVIII.,"and Lakshmana; and we are bound unto Bharata like unto a (sacrificial,)"
10396,SECTION XLVIII.,beast before one that is to slaughter it. Surely that mighty
10397,SECTION XLVIII.,"car-warrior, with deepest collar-bones having a countenance resembling"
10398,SECTION XLVIII.,"the full moon, sable-hued, repressing his foes, with his arms reaching"
10399,SECTION XLVIII.,unto his knees and lotus-like eyes—Rāma the elder brother of
10400,SECTION XLVIII.,"Lakshmana—always speaking first (to a visitor,) suave, truth-telling,"
10401,SECTION XLVIII.,"endowed with prowess, amiable unto all men, and lovely like the moon"
10402,SECTION XLVIII.,"himself, surely that foremost of men gifted with the strength of a mad"
10403,SECTION XLVIII.,"elephant, will grace the forests, ranging it around."" Thus lamenting in"

10406,SECTION XLVIII.,
10407,SECTION XLVIII.,"As the women were thus bewailing Rāghava in their homes, the Sun set and"

10410,SECTION XLVIII.,"edifying discourse ceased. And the shops of the tradesmen being closed,"
10411,SECTION XLVIII.,"and festive mirth having disappeared, and people becoming defenceless,"
10412,SECTION XLVIII.,the city of Ayodhyā resembled the firmament deprived of the stars. And
10413,SECTION XLVIII.,distressed for the sake of Rāma as if it was a son or a brother of
10414,SECTION XLVIII.,"theirs that was banished, the women weeping forlorn, lamented with"
10415,SECTION XLVIII.,senses lost; and Rāma was to them more than a son. And the voice of song
10416,SECTION XLVIII.,"and festal glee and dance and sounds of instruments having died away,"
10417,SECTION XLVIII.,"and mirth having disappeared, and the shops not displaying their wares,"
10418,SECTION XLVIII.,Ayodhyā then resembled the mighty ocean emptied of its waters.
10419,SECTION XLVIII.,

10428,SECTION XLIX.,"THAT best of men, Rāma, remembering his father’s command cleared a large"

10430,SECTION XLIX.,auspicious night was spent. And then having offered up his devotions
10431,SECTION XLIX.,"unto the beneficent Sandhyā, Rāma entered into another country. And"
10432,SECTION XLIX.,"seeing villages having ploughed fields on their skirts, and flowering"
10433,SECTION XLIX.,"woods, he by means of those excellent horses, proceeded very fast"
10434,SECTION XLIX.,"although seeming to go slowly. And as Rāma proceeded,¹⁴⁷ he heard the"
10435,SECTION XLIX.,"villagers speaking to each other, saying,—""Fie on king Daçarātha, who"
10436,SECTION XLIX.,"has yielded himself up unto lust! Ah! the rebutless, fell and sinful"
10437,SECTION XLIX.,"Kaikeyi intent upon impiety, having put by her honor, has resolved upon"
10438,SECTION XLIX.,an exceedingly atrocious deed—she that exiles into the woods such a
10439,SECTION XLIX.,"virtuous son of the monarch, endowed with high wisdom, kind, and having"
10440,SECTION XLIX.,his senses under control.¹⁴⁸ Alas! king Daçarātha has no affection for
10441,SECTION XLIX.,"his own son, since he wishes to dismiss from hence Rāma sinless and dear"
10442,SECTION XLIX.,"unto the subjects."" Hearing these words of the villagers, that hero, the"
10443,SECTION XLIX.,"lord of Koçala, left Koçala behind him. Then crossing the river"
10444,SECTION XLIX.,"Vedaçruti of sacred waters, Rāma went in the direction of the quarter in"
10445,SECTION XLIX.,which Agastya resided. (South)
10446,SECTION XLIX.,
10447,SECTION XLIX.,"Then proceeding for a good while, he crossed the coolflowing stream"
10448,SECTION XLIX.,"Gomati running in the direction of the ocean, with its banks filled with"

10450,SECTION XLIX.,of fleet-coursing horses next crossed over the river Sandika resounding
10451,SECTION XLIX.,with the cries of cranes and peacocks. Here Rāma showed unto Vaidehi
10452,SECTION XLIX.,those flourishing regions that had formerly been conferred by king Manu
10453,SECTION XLIX.,"on Ikshwāku, and which teemed with populous tracts. Then frequently"
10454,SECTION XLIX.,"addressing the charioteer, saying, ""O Suta"", that best of men furnished"
10455,SECTION XLIX.,"with grace and endowed with a voice like that of a mad swan,"
10456,SECTION XLIX.,"spoke,—""When shall I coming back, range ahunting the blossoming groves"
10457,SECTION XLIX.,"of the Sarayu, along with my father and mother? I do not so much long"
10458,SECTION XLIX.,for hunting in the woods of the Sarayu; but a relish (for the pastime)
10459,SECTION XLIX.,is considered as beyond compare being held in esteem by the Rājarshis.
10460,SECTION XLIX.,Hunting in the forest was introduced for the recreation of Rāghavas. Yet
10461,SECTION XLIX.,do I not take beyond measure to the chase which has been followed in

10533,SECTION L.,"mighty car-warrior said unto the charioteer, Sumantra, ""We will rest"

10535,SECTION L.,"a profusion of flowers and fresh leaves. Here, O charioteer, will we"

10538,SECTION L.,Gandharbas and beasts and serpents and fowls. Thereupon saying unto
10539,SECTION L.,"Rāghava, ""Very well,"" Lakshmana and Sumantra with the horses went to the"
10540,SECTION L.,"Ingudi tree. And reaching the tree, that desendant of Ikshwāku alighted"
10541,SECTION L.,"from the car along with his wife and Lakshmana. Then descending,"
10542,SECTION L.,"Sumantra relieved those excellent horses, and with joined hands stood"
10543,SECTION L.,before Rāma seated at the foot of the tree. There lived at the place a
10544,SECTION L.,"king named Guha, a friend unto Rāma, dear as his own self, a Nishāda by"
10545,SECTION L.,"birth, powerful and famed as the lord of the Nishādas. Hearing that that"
10546,SECTION L.,"foremost of men, Rāma, had arrived at the place, he (Guha) surrounded by"
10547,SECTION L.,his aged counsellors and kindred came unto him. Seeing the lord of the
10548,SECTION L.,"Nishadhas at a distance, Rāma came up unto him in company with Sumitrā’s"

10550,SECTION L.,"Ayodhyā this kingdom is unto thee. What shall I do for thee? Who, O"
10551,SECTION L.,"might-armed one, receives such a welcome guest?"" Then speedily bringing"
10552,SECTION L.,"various kinds of sapid rice and Arghyas, he said,—""O mighty -armed one,"
10553,SECTION L.,has thy journey been a pleasant one? This entire earth is thine. We are
10554,SECTION L.,"thy servants; thou art our master. Do thou rule here, accepting the"
10555,SECTION L.,eatables and drinkables and those that are to be sucked and excellent
10556,SECTION L.,"beds and fodder."" When Guha had said this, Rāghava answered him,"
10557,SECTION L.,"saying,—""We have been well received by thee and are well pleased with"
10558,SECTION L.,"thee, since coming here on foot thou hast shown us affection."" Then"
10559,SECTION L.,"pressing Guha hard with his arms, Rāma said, ""O Guha, it is by good luck"
10560,SECTION L.,that I see thee whole along with thy friends. Is thy kingdom in peace
10561,SECTION L.,both as regards thy friends and the forest? The things that thou hast
10562,SECTION L.,presented me with out of love I accept but cannot enjoy. Do thou know me
10563,SECTION L.,"as assuming an ascetic mode of life in the woods, in which I am to wear"
10564,SECTION L.,"Kuça and bark and live upon fruits and roots. So, will the single"
10565,SECTION L.,"exception of the food for the horses, things require I none; and these"
10566,SECTION L.,"horses being well kept, I shall consider myself as entertained by thee."
10567,SECTION L.,"These are the favorites of my father, Daçarātha, and on these horses"
10568,SECTION L.,"being well provided for, I shall be well received. Thereupon Guha on the"
10569,SECTION L.,"spot commanded the men, saying, ""Let the horses have without delay meats"
10570,SECTION L.,"and drinks."" Then putting his sheet over his person, he (Rāma) performed"
10571,SECTION L.,"his evening devotions. Having done this, he took as his sustenance the"
10572,SECTION L.,water that had been procured by Lakshmana himself. On Rāma having lain
10573,SECTION L.,"down on the ground along with his wife, Lakshmana washed their feet, and"
10574,SECTION L.,then remained stationed under the tree. Then bow in hand and with his
10575,SECTION L.,"wits about him, conversing with Sumitrā’s son along with the charioteer,"
10576,SECTION L.,"Guha remained awake, watching Rāma. Thus the livelong night passed away"

10596,SECTION LI.,nothing herein is unknown to me. I shall vanquish even any mighty body
10597,SECTION LI.,"of fourfold forces (that may come up against us.)"" Thereupon Lakshmana"

10599,SECTION LI.,"virtue, we do not fear to live in this place. But how with Daçarātha’s"
10600,SECTION LI.,son lying down on the ground along with Sitā can I indulge in sleep or
10601,SECTION LI.,what is the use of my living and enjoying happiness? Him do thou behold
10602,SECTION LI.,"with ease asleep on the grass in company with Sitā, who was incapable of"
10603,SECTION LI.,"being borne in fight by the gods and the Asuras. Hfm do thou behold, who"

10607,SECTION LI.,"the earth will shortly be widowed."" Having bewailed aloud, the women"
10608,SECTION LI.,"have, methinks, (by this time) ceased through fatigue, and the king’s"
10609,SECTION LI.,"residence is still. I cannot hope that Kauçalyā, the king, and my mother"
10610,SECTION LI.,"are yet alive. If they are, it is for this night only. Even if my mother"
10611,SECTION LI.,"live looking up to Satrughna, yet this is my grief that that mother of a"
10612,SECTION LI.,"hero, Kauçalyā will breathe her last And that palace filled with people"

10617,SECTION LI.,die after him and then my mother will depart this life. Frustrated in
10618,SECTION LI.,"his desire, my father, foiled in his endeavours to confer the kingdom on"
10619,SECTION LI.,"Rāma, will, exclaiming ’All is lost,’ ’All is lost,’ give up the ghost."
10620,SECTION LI.,Sirely they are blessed that when the time shall come when the king will

10656,SECTION LII.,"joined hands, Guha spake unto Rāghava, saying,—""The boat is ready,"

10658,SECTION LII.,"resemblest the son of a celestial, here is the boat for thee, O foremost"

10660,SECTION LII.,"excellent vows, do thou ascend it."" Thereupon the highly energetic Rāma"
10661,SECTION LII.,"said unto Guha the following words,—""I have attained my end through"
10662,SECTION LII.,"thee. Do thou at once get on board the baggage."" Then donning on their"
10663,SECTION LII.,"mail and equipped with their bows, quivers and swords, the Rāghavas"
10664,SECTION LII.,along with Sitā descended unto the Gangā. Then coming forward in humble
10665,SECTION LII.,"guise before Rāma cognizant of virtue, the charioteer said with joined"
10666,SECTION LII.,"hands,—""What shall I do (now)?"" Thereupon Daçarātha’s son touching"
10667,SECTION LII.,"Sumantra by his goodly right hand, said,— ""O Sumantra, do thou again"
10668,SECTION LII.,"repair unto the monarch, but let thy senses be unclouded."" ""Do thou"""
10669,SECTION LII.,"said he unto the charioteer, ""turn back. So far I have come (in"
10670,SECTION LII.,"obedience to the order of the monarch;. Now, renouncing the car, will I"
10671,SECTION LII.,"repair unto the mighty forest on foot"" Finding himself thus commanded,"
10672,SECTION LII.,"the charioteer, Sumantra grieved at heart spoke unto that best of men,"
10673,SECTION LII.,"the descendant of Ikshwāku. ""That Destiny owing to which you will have"
10674,SECTION LII.,"to pass your days in the forest like a low person, along with your"
10675,SECTION LII.,"brother and wife, has in this world been withstood by none. I deem the"
10676,SECTION LII.,"Brahmācharyya mode of life, or study, or meekness or sincerity as"
10677,SECTION LII.,"attended with no fruit, since you have come by calamity. O Rāghava,"
10678,SECTION LII.,"living in the forest with Vaidehi and your brother, you, O Lord, attain"
10679,SECTION LII.,"a state (of supreme excellence), having, as it were, conquered the three"
10680,SECTION LII.,"worlds. O Rāma, it is we, wretched that we are, that are undone, as we,"
10681,SECTION LII.,"deprived of your company, shall come under the sinful Kaikeyi expressing"
10682,SECTION LII.,"great misery."" Having said this, the charioteer, Sumantra, seeing Rāma"
10683,SECTION LII.,"intent upon going to a distant land, wept for a long while in heaviness"
10684,SECTION LII.,"of heart. Then when he had dried up his tears, and sanctified himself by"
10685,SECTION LII.,"touching the water of the Gangā, Rāma again addressed the charioteer in"
10686,SECTION LII.,"sweet words, saying,—""I do not find any one that is a friend of the sons"
10687,SECTION LII.,of Ikshwāku like unto thee. Do thou so act that king Daçarātha may not
10688,SECTION LII.,grieve (for me). The lord of earth hath been deprived of his senses by
10689,SECTION LII.,"grief, hath grown old, and is oppressed by the weight of desires"
10690,SECTION LII.,(thwarted). Therefore it is that I tell thee this. Whatever that noble-
10691,SECTION LII.,"minded lord of earth commands for the pleasure of Kaikeyi, should by us"
10692,SECTION LII.,"be done with alacrity. It is for this that those lords of men, kings,"
10693,SECTION LII.,"govern,—viz., that others may not thwart their purposes. O Sumantra, do"
10694,SECTION LII.,"thou act so, that the mighty monarch may not come across any thing"
10695,SECTION LII.,"unpleasant, or be attacked with chagrin through grief. Do thou saluting"
10696,SECTION LII.,"him for me say these words unto the aged monarch, who has his senses"
10697,SECTION LII.,"under complete control, and who hath never seen misfortune before."
10698,SECTION LII.,"’Neither I nor Lakshmana grieve for being ejected out of Ayodhyā, or"
10699,SECTION LII.,that we shall have to abide in the forest. After these fourteen years
10700,SECTION LII.,"have gone by, you will see Lakshmana, Sitā. and myself come to you"
10701,SECTION LII.,"speedily.’ Having thus, O Sumantra, in my name again and again spoken to"
10702,SECTION LII.,"the king, to my mother and to Kaikevi along with the other revered"
10703,SECTION LII.,ladies do thou communicate unto Kauçalyā our welfare conveying unto her
10704,SECTION LII.,at the same time Sitā’s and Lakshmana’s salutations to her feet as well
10705,SECTION LII.,"those of myself who am her eldest son. Do thou also tell the king,— ’Do"

10707,SECTION LII.,invested with royalty. And when you have embraced Bharata and installed
10708,SECTION LII.,"him in the kingdom, you no longer be overpowered with grief on our"

10710,SECTION LII.,"it behoves thee to bear thyself to all thy mothers, without making any"
10711,SECTION LII.,"distinction at all. As Kaikeyi is unto thee, so without distinction is"

10714,SECTION LII.,"pleasure of our father, he will be able to secure happiness both in this"
10715,SECTION LII.,"world and the next."" Told by Rāma to go back and instructed in this"
10716,SECTION LII.,"wise, Sumantra having heard everything, addressed Kākutstha from"
10717,SECTION LII.,"affection, saying,—""It behoves you to forgive what I say plainly from"
10718,SECTION LII.,"affection, without letting myself be overwhelmed with emotion, and with"
10719,SECTION LII.,"due reverence for you. How can I, O child, without you return to that"
10720,SECTION LII.,city! which seems as if afflicted with the grief incident to the loss of
10721,SECTION LII.,"a son? Having then seen my car with Rāma on it, the hearts of the people"
10722,SECTION LII.,and the palace now will in all likelihood burst when they shall see it

10724,SECTION LII.,"car, like a host seeing a car with its hero slain and the charioteer"
10725,SECTION LII.,alone left in the field. Thinking in their minds that you although
10726,SECTION LII.,"actually at a great distance from them, are before them, the subjects"
10727,SECTION LII.,(not finding you) will renounce food (and thus destroy themselves.) You
10728,SECTION LII.,yourself witnessed how the subjects overwhelmed with grief on your
10729,SECTION LII.,"account, conducted themselves when you were being banished unto the"
10730,SECTION LII.,"woods. They will on seeing me with the car, burst out into lamentations"
10731,SECTION LII.,exceeding a hundred times in bitterness those in which they indulged
10732,SECTION LII.,"when you set out for the forest. Shall I say unto the worshipful one,—’I"
10733,SECTION LII.,have conveyed your son to the home of his maternal uncle. Do you not
10734,SECTION LII.,grieve’. I will never tell such a lie. Yet how can I speak this truth

10738,SECTION LII.,without you; and it behoves you to permit me to follow you to the
10739,SECTION LII.,"forest. But if you forsake me who beseech you, I will as soon as left by"
10740,SECTION LII.,"you, enter into fire along with the car. I shall, O Rāghava, by means of"
10741,SECTION LII.,"this car, withstand all those impediments that shall present themselves"
10742,SECTION LII.,against your ascetic austerities in the forest. I have through your
10743,SECTION LII.,favour experienced the pleasure of driving the car. I expect at your
10744,SECTION LII.,hands the pleasure of living in the woods. Be you propitious. It is my
10745,SECTION LII.,"wish to remain in the forest with you, and do you say,"
10746,SECTION LII.,"affectionately—’Do you remain by my side’. And these horses, O hero,"
10747,SECTION LII.,will attain to a supreme state if they serve you during your abode in
10748,SECTION LII.,"the forest. Living in the forest, I will serve you with the crown of my"
10749,SECTION LII.,head; and I will entirely renounce Ayodhyā or the celestial regions
10750,SECTION LII.,themselves. Even as a doer of evil deeds cannot enter the metropolis of
10751,SECTION LII.,"the mighty Indra, I am incapable of entering Ayodhyā without you. And"
10752,SECTION LII.,"this is my desire that the term of exile over, I may carry you back to"
10753,SECTION LII.,the palace on this very car. Remaining with you in the forest the
10754,SECTION LII.,"fourteen years will pass away dwindled into a moment, but without you,"
10755,SECTION LII.,they shall assume the proportions of an hundred years. O you bearing
10756,SECTION LII.,"affection towards your servants, it does not behove you to forsake your"
10757,SECTION LII.,"servant having regard for you, ever abiding by the way that is wended by"
10758,SECTION LII.,"the son of his master, and observing the duties of his pesition."""
10759,SECTION LII.,"Thereupon Rāma kind towards servants, said these words unto Sumantra as"
10760,SECTION LII.,"he besought him thus humbly in various ways, ""O thou that bearest"
10761,SECTION LII.,"attachment unto thy master, I know that thou regardest me highly. But do"
10762,SECTION LII.,thou listen as to why I send thee to the city from hence. Seeing thee
10763,SECTION LII.,"returned to the city, my youngest mother Kaikeyi will believe that Rāma"
10764,SECTION LII.,has gone to the woods. Then well pleased on my having repaired to the
10765,SECTION LII.,"woods, she will not entertain any apprehension anent the righteous"
10766,SECTION LII.,"monarch, thinking that he is untruthful. This is my first wish that my"
10767,SECTION LII.,"youngest mother may obtain her son’s kingdom, properous and well"
10768,SECTION LII.,"protected by Bharata. Do thou, O Sumantra, bear thyself unto the palace"
10769,SECTION LII.,"to compass the end of both the king and myself, and do thou communicate"
10770,SECTION LII.,"in the desired way what I have said unto the respective parties."" Having"
10771,SECTION LII.,"said this unto the charioteer and consoled him again and again, the"
10772,SECTION LII.,"energetic Rāma spoke unto Guha the following words fraught with reason,"
10773,SECTION LII.,"""O Guha, I should not now reside in a forest inhabited by men. I should"
10774,SECTION LII.,certainly now abide in an asylum in proper guise. In harmony with the
10775,SECTION LII.,"wishes of Sitā and Lakshmana, I, imposing on myself in the interests of"
10776,SECTION LII.,"my father selfdenial and wearing that ornament of ascetics, a head of"
10777,SECTION LII.,"matted hair, will go (to the forest). Do thou therefore bring me starch"
10778,SECTION LII.,"from the banian."" Thereupon Guha speedily brought the starch for the"
10779,SECTION LII.,"prince; and prepared matted locks for himself, Rāma and Lakshmana. And"
10780,SECTION LII.,that mighty- armed chief of men wore matted locks. And those brothers
10781,SECTION LII.,"Rāma and Lakshmana dressed as mendicants, and wearing heads of matted"
10782,SECTION LII.,"hair, appeared like saints. Then entering upon the Vānaprastha mode of"
10783,SECTION LII.,"life, Rāma along with Lakshmana assuming the vow of that life, observed"
10784,SECTION LII.,"unto that adherent of his, Guha,—""Do thou, my friend, vigilantly protect"
10785,SECTION LII.,"the army, the exchequer, the fort and the provinces; for a kingdom"
10786,SECTION LII.,"demands all the exertions (of the king thereof)."" Then taking the"
10787,SECTION LII.,"permission of Guha, the descendant of Ikshwāku, holding his soul in"
10788,SECTION LII.,"calmness, set out with his wife and Lakshmana. Seeing a boat at the"
10789,SECTION LII.,"river-side, that son of Ikshwāku desirous of crossing the swift-coursing"
10790,SECTION LII.,"Gangā, spoke these words,—""Do thou ascend, gently, O foremost of men,"
10791,SECTION LII.,"the boat that stayeth here, after the making the virtuous Sitā ascend by"
10792,SECTION LII.,"taking her by the hand."" Hearing his brother’s command, that"
10793,SECTION LII.,"strong-willed one, furthering everything, having made Mithilā’s daughter"
10794,SECTION LII.,"ascend, ascended himself. That energetic elder brother of Lakshmana next"
10795,SECTION LII.,"ascended himself. Then the lord of the Nishādas, Guha, incited his"
10796,SECTION LII.,"kinsfolk. Having got on board the boat, the exceedingly puissant Rāghava"
10797,SECTION LII.,"for securing his welfare, recited _mantras_ fit to be recited by"
10798,SECTION LII.,"Kshatriyas and Brāhmanas. Then that mighty car-warrior, Lakshmana,"
10799,SECTION LII.,"sipping water from the river as laid down in the scriptures, bowed down"
10800,SECTION LII.,"to it along with Sitā in gladness of heart. Then telling Sumantra, Guha,"
10801,SECTION LII.,"and the forces, Rāma ascending the boat, ordered the boatmen (to"
10802,SECTION LII.,"proceed). Then the boat decked out by the helmsman, moved by them, and"
10803,SECTION LII.,"urged on by the pulls of the goodly oars, proceeded apace in the water."
10804,SECTION LII.,"Having arrived at the middle of the Bhāgirathi, that blameless one,"
10805,SECTION LII.,"Vaidehi, with joined hands, addressed the river, saying,— ""O Gangā,"
10806,SECTION LII.,"protected by thee, may the son of the intelligent and mighty monarch,"
10807,SECTION LII.,"Daçarātha, execute the mandate (of the latter.) Having spent complete"
10808,SECTION LII.,"fourteen years in the forest, he will return in company with his brother"
10809,SECTION LII.,"and myself. Then, O worshipful one, O thou of auspicious fortune, having"
10810,SECTION LII.,"returned safely, I will, O Gangā, worship thee, thou that crownst every"
10811,SECTION LII.,"desire. O thou that wendst in three ways, O revered one, thou envelopest"
10812,SECTION LII.,the regions of Brahmā. Thou appearest in this world as the spouse of the
10813,SECTION LII.,"Ocean- king. I will, O respected one, bow down unto thee, O beauteous"
10814,SECTION LII.,"one, I will hymn thee, when, with good fortune returned, the foremost of"
10815,SECTION LII.,"men has obtained the kingdom, I will to please thee give away unto"
10816,SECTION LII.,"Brāhmanas hundreds and thousands of kine, cloths, sapid rice, and"
10817,SECTION LII.,"vessels of wine by thousands, and _pillaos_. O worshipful one, I will"
10818,SECTION LII.,worship thee on Rāma having returned to the city. And I will worship all
10819,SECTION LII.,"the gods that dwell on thy banks, as well as the holy spots and fanes,"
10820,SECTION LII.,"as soon as, O sinless one, that mighty-armed one without sin will,"
10821,SECTION LII.,"coming back from his abode in the forest, enter Ayodhyā in company with"
10822,SECTION LII.,"his brother and myself."" Having thus addressed the Gangā, that blameless"
10823,SECTION LII.,"one ever obedient unto her husband, swiftly went to the south bank (of"
10824,SECTION LII.,"the river). Going to the (other) bank of the stream, that best of men,"
10825,SECTION LII.,and subduer of foes stood along with his brother and Vaidehi. Then that
10826,SECTION LII.,"long-armed one spoke unto the enhancer of Sumitrā’s delight, saying,—""Be"
10827,SECTION LII.,"thou, whether in society or solitude, intent upon protecting Sitā. Of"
10828,SECTION LII.,"course it behoves us to protect her in lone places. Do thou, O son of"
10829,SECTION LII.,"Sumitrā, go ahead; and let Sitā follow thee. I myself will go in your"
10830,SECTION LII.,"wake, protecting both yourself and Sitā. Surely, O foremost of men, we"
10831,SECTION LII.,should now protect each other. We have not yet performed any of the
10832,SECTION LII.,arduous tasks. Today Vaidehi will know the grief of a life in the woods.
10833,SECTION LII.,"And today she will enter the forest destitute of the concourse of men,"
10834,SECTION LII.,"devoid of fields and gardens, uneven, and containing pits, etc."" Hearing"
10835,SECTION LII.,"Rāma’s words, Lakshmana went ahead; that descendant of Raghu, Rāma,"
10836,SECTION LII.,followed Sitā.
10837,SECTION LII.,
10838,SECTION LII.,"On Rāma having speedily crossed the Gangā, the distressed Sumantra who"
10839,SECTION LII.,"had been gazing at him stedfastly, being no longer able to discern him,"
10840,SECTION LII.,"turned away his eyes and, overcome with grief, shed tears. And having"
10841,SECTION LII.,"crossed that mighty river, that high-souled one, that bestower of boons,"
10842,SECTION LII.,"resembling in prowess a Lokapāla, without delay entered the flourishing"
10843,SECTION LII.,and smiling Vatsas crowned with goodly crops. And then the two
10844,SECTION LII.,"(brothers) having slain the four kinds of beasts, viz., boars, _risyas_,"
10845,SECTION LII.,"_prishatas_ and _mahārurus_,¹⁴⁹ and taking their flesh, in the evening"
10846,SECTION LII.,"took refuge under a mighty tree, feeling the demands of appetite."
10847,SECTION LII.,
10848,SECTION LII.,¹⁴⁹ Varieties of deer.— T.

10852,SECTION LIII.,SECTION LIII.
10853,SECTION LIII.,
10854,SECTION LIII.,
10855,SECTION LIII.,"Having taken refuge under the tree and performed his evening devotions,"
10856,SECTION LIII.,"that foremost of those capable of charming others, Rāma, addressed"
10857,SECTION LIII.,"Lakshmana, saying,—""To day is the first night (which we must spend)"
10858,SECTION LIII.,outside the inhabited tracts without the company of Sumantra. Thou ought
10859,SECTION LIII.,"not to suffer thy mind to be uneasy on that score. From tonight forth,"
10860,SECTION LIII.,"we shall have to guard her vigilantly; for, O Lakshmana, the"
10861,SECTION LIII.,preservation of what she has as well as the securing unto her of what
10862,SECTION LIII.,"she has not, rests with us. We will, O son of Sumitrā, anyhow pass the"
10863,SECTION LIII.,night; let us ourselves procuring (leaves) and spreading them on the
10864,SECTION LIII.,"ground, anyhow lie down on it."" Saying this, Rāma lying down on the"
10865,SECTION LIII.,"ground although worthy of a costly bed, spoke these excellent words unto"
10866,SECTION LIII.,"Sumitrā’s son,—""O Lakshmana, surely the king sleeps uneasily to day, and"
10867,SECTION LIII.,Kaikeyi having attained her end ought to be satisfied. Will not that
10868,SECTION LIII.,"revered lady, for the purpose of having Bharata established in the"
10869,SECTION LIII.,"kingdom, take the king’s life, when she shall see Bharata arrived?"
10870,SECTION LIII.,"Forlorn and old and deprived of me, I do not know what he will do, his"
10871,SECTION LIII.,"soul possessed by desire, and having come under the influence of"
10872,SECTION LIII.,Kaikeyi. Viewing this calamity (that has overtaken us) and the disorder
10873,SECTION LIII.,"that has taken place in the senses of the monarch, I deem even lust as"
10874,SECTION LIII.,"more potent than either virtue or interest. O Lakshmana, what man is"
10875,SECTION LIII.,"there ignorant though he be, who for the sake of a female forsaketh as"
10876,SECTION LIII.,"my father has done me, his son following his foot-steps? Ah! Kaikeyi’s"
10877,SECTION LIII.,son Bharata with his wife is really happy—he that enjoys the sole
10878,SECTION LIII.,sovereignity of the delighted Koçalas. Now that our father has grown old
10879,SECTION LIII.,"and I have taken refuge in the forest, he will alone experience the"
10880,SECTION LIII.,"supreme felicity in the kingdom. He that renouncing interest and virtue,"
10881,SECTION LIII.,"followes lust, speedily gets himself involved in troubles even like king"
10882,SECTION LIII.,"Daçarātha. O amiable one, I think that Kaikeyi has been born for making"
10883,SECTION LIII.,"an end of Daçarātha, sending me into exile, and conferring the kingdom"
10884,SECTION LIII.,"on Bharata. At present for imparting me pain, Kaikeyi intoxicated by the"
10885,SECTION LIII.,"tide of good fortune, will afflict Kauçalyā and Sumitrā. Thy mother, the"
10886,SECTION LIII.,"revered Sumitrā, will be smitten with grief on our account. Do thou,"
10887,SECTION LIII.,"Lakshmana, tomorrow morning repair unto Ayodhyā: I alone will go unto"
10888,SECTION LIII.,Dandaka along with Sitā. Thou wilt be the protector of the helpless
10889,SECTION LIII.,"Kauçalyā. Kaikeyi is surely mean-minded, she perpetrates wrongs from"
10890,SECTION LIII.,"malice. O thou cognizant of virtue, she may administer poison unto my"
10891,SECTION LIII.,"mother. Surely, O child, in a former birth, women were bereft of their"
10892,SECTION LIII.,"sons by my mother, O son of Sumitrā; and it is for this that this"
10893,SECTION LIII.,misfortune has befallen her. Having been brought up and reared with
10894,SECTION LIII.,"great pains by Kauçalyā, I have left her at the time when her labors"
10895,SECTION LIII.,"ought to have borne fruit. Fie on me! Let no woman, son of Sumitrā, give"
10896,SECTION LIII.,birth unto a son like me who have imparted such infinite pain unto my
10897,SECTION LIII.,"mother. O Lakshmana, I consider my mother’s female parrot as more"
10898,SECTION LIII.,"sharing her affection, since she is heard to say, ’O Suka, do you bite"
10899,SECTION LIII.,"the foot of the foe?’ What am I, O repressor of foes, now to do for her,"
10900,SECTION LIII.,"bewailing, of slender fortune,—she that hath not profitted in the least"
10901,SECTION LIII.,"by her son, and who stands in no further need of his good offices?"
10902,SECTION LIII.,"Surely my unfortunate mother, Kauçalyā, bereft of me, lies down on the"
10903,SECTION LIII.,"ground, overwhelmed will woe, and plunged in an ocean of grief. O"
10904,SECTION LIII.,"Lakshmana, enraged, I alone, without doubt, can rid Ayodhyā—the Earth"
10905,SECTION LIII.,herself—by means of my arrows. But improper is the display of prowess
10906,SECTION LIII.,"for no reason. O sinless one, I am afraid of unrighteousness and of the"
10907,SECTION LIII.,"next life; and for this it is that, O Lakshmana, I do not install myself"
10908,SECTION LIII.,"in the kingdom."""
10909,SECTION LIII.,
10910,SECTION LIII.,Having in solitude for a long while piteously bewailed thus and in other
10911,SECTION LIII.,"ways, Rāma sat silent in the night with tears in his eyes. Thereupon"
10912,SECTION LIII.,"Lakshmana consoled Rāma spent with lamentation, like unto fire deprived"
10913,SECTION LIII.,"of its radiance or the ocean of its tide. ""Surely, O Rāma, O foremost of"
10914,SECTION LIII.,"warriors, on your having come out, the city of Ayodhyā is shorn of its"
10915,SECTION LIII.,splendour like the night deprived of the moon. This is not fit that you
10916,SECTION LIII.,"should grieve; for thereby, O foremost of men, you make both Sitā and"
10917,SECTION LIII.,"myself grieve. Rāghava, deprived of you neither Sitā nor I can live for"
10918,SECTION LIII.,"a moment, like fish taken out of water : without you, O repressor of"
10919,SECTION LIII.,"foes, I wish to see neither my father, nor Satrughna, nor Sumitrā, nor"
10920,SECTION LIII.,"heaven itself."" Then viewing from where they sat at ease their well-laid"
10921,SECTION LIII.,"bed under the banian, those virtuous ones (Rāma and Sitā) went to it."
10922,SECTION LIII.,Hearing Lakshmana’s excellent and appropriate words with which he gladly
10923,SECTION LIII.,"assumed a life in the woods, that subduer of foes, Rāghava, in the name"
10924,SECTION LIII.,"of righteousness, at once folly granted him the permission to dwell with"
10925,SECTION LIII.,him for the entire fourteen years. Then like unto a couple of lions
10926,SECTION LIII.,"dwelling on a mountain-summit, at that lone spot of the extensive"
10927,SECTION LIII.,"forest, those powerful perpetuators of the Raghu race, began to dwell"
10928,SECTION LIII.,without fear.
10929,SECTION LIII.,
10930,SECTION LIII.,
10931,SECTION LIII.,
10932,SECTION LIV.,SECTION LIV.
10933,SECTION LIV.,
10934,SECTION LIV.,
10935,SECTION LIV.,"Having passed the auspicious night underneath that mighty tree, they,"
10936,SECTION LIV.,"when the sun had risen in unclouded splendour, went away from that"
10937,SECTION LIV.,"place. Then diving into a mighty forest, they proceeded in the direction"
10938,SECTION LIV.,in which the Bhāgirathi Gangā meets with the Yamunā. And those
10939,SECTION LIV.,"illustrious ones went on, viewing at intervals various fields and"
10940,SECTION LIV.,delightful lands which they had never seen before. And going on
10941,SECTION LIV.,"beholding various kinds of blossoming trees, Rāma when the day had"
10942,SECTION LIV.,"declined, spoke unto Sumitrā’s son, saying, ""O son of Sumitrā, do thou"
10943,SECTION LIV.,behold the beautiful wreath of smoke that rises in front of Prayāga—sign
10944,SECTION LIV.,"of the worshipful Fire, and I infer some ascetic to be near. For certain"
10945,SECTION LIV.,we have arrived at the confluence of the Gangā and the Yamunā; and it is
10946,SECTION LIV.,for this that we hear the roar of the waters produced by the rushing of
10947,SECTION LIV.,them. And all these various trees with their wood hewn away by foresters
10948,SECTION LIV.,"are seen in the asylums."" Thus having proceeded at ease, those bowmen"
10949,SECTION LIV.,"when the sun stood aslant, arrived in the vicinity of the ascetic’s"
10950,SECTION LIV.,residence on the delta of the Yamunā and the Gangā. And proceeding
10951,SECTION LIV.,"awhile on the way, Rāma, in presence of the asylum, came up to"
10952,SECTION LIV.,"Bharadwāja’s place, frightening beasts and birds. And arriving at the"
10953,SECTION LIV.,"hermitage, the heroes desirous of seeing the ascetic, stood at a"
10954,SECTION LIV.,"distance with Sitā behind them. And as soon as entering in, that exalted"
10955,SECTION LIV.,"one saw that high-souled anchoret of accomplished vows, who had attained"
10956,SECTION LIV.,"spiritual insight through austerities, sitting surrounded by his"
10957,SECTION LIV.,"disciples after having finished the Agnihotrā, Rāma with joined hands"
10958,SECTION LIV.,saluted him along with Sumitrā’s son and Sitā. Then Lakshmana’s elder
10959,SECTION LIV.,"brother imparted unto Bharadwāja a knowledge of himself. ""O worshipful"
10960,SECTION LIV.,"one, we are the sons of Daçarātha, Rāma and Lakshmana. This is my wife,"
10961,SECTION LIV.,the auspicious daughter of Janaka. This blameless one followeth me unto
10962,SECTION LIV.,"the solitary forest; and my dear younger brother, the son of Sumitrā"
10963,SECTION LIV.,"too, observing the vow, follows me, who have been exiled by my father. O"
10964,SECTION LIV.,"revered one, commissioned by my father, I will enter the forest of"
10965,SECTION LIV.,"asceticism, and there subsisting on fruits and roots will practise"
10966,SECTION LIV.,"virtue."" Hearing those words of the intelligent prince, that righteous"
10967,SECTION LIV.,(ascetic) brought a bull¹⁵⁰ as well as _arghya_ and water and divers
10968,SECTION LIV.,kinds of edibles consisting of wild fruits and roots. And that one of
10969,SECTION LIV.,"fiery austerities assigned quarters, along with beasts and birds as well"
10970,SECTION LIV.,"as ascetics, for Rāma. Then paying homage unto Rāma as he proceeded by"
10971,SECTION LIV.,"short stages, and asking him,—""Has your journey been a pleasant"
10972,SECTION LIV.,"one?""—the ascetic sat down. And when Rāghava had sat down after"
10973,SECTION LIV.,"receiving the homage, Bharadwāja spoke unto him these words fraught with"
10974,SECTION LIV.,"virtue,— ""O Kākutstha, I behold thee come after a long time. I have"
10975,SECTION LIV.,heard of thy causeless exile. This spot at the meeting of the mighty
10976,SECTION LIV.,"rivers is lonely, sacred and charming. Do thou dwell here happily."" Thus"
10977,SECTION LIV.,"addressed by Bharadwāja, that descendant of Raghu, Rāma intent on the"
10978,SECTION LIV.,"welfare of all, answered in auspicious words,—""O reverend one, I"
10979,SECTION LIV.,"apprehend that, living hard by, the inhabitants of the city and the"
10980,SECTION LIV.,"provinces, thinking me as easily to be seen, will come to this asylum"
10981,SECTION LIV.,desirous of beholding me and Vaidehi. It is for this reason that living
10982,SECTION LIV.,"at this place does not recommend itself unto me. Do thou, O worshipful"
10983,SECTION LIV.,"one, hit upon a retired and agreeable asylum where Janaka’s daughter"
10984,SECTION LIV.,"worthy of happiness, will pass her days pleasantly "" Hearing this"
10985,SECTION LIV.,"auspicious speech of Rāghava, that eminent anchoret Bharadwāja said"
10986,SECTION LIV.,"these words calculated to serve Rāma’s purpose,—""Ten Krosas hence, my"
10987,SECTION LIV.,"child, is the mountain where thou shalt dwell. It is inhabited by"
10988,SECTION LIV.,"_maharshis_, and is sacred, and picturseque throughout, abounding in"
10989,SECTION LIV.,"_Golāngulas_, monkeys, and bears,—known by the name of"
10990,SECTION LIV.,Chitrakuta—resembling Gandhamādana. On beholding the peaks of
10991,SECTION LIV.,"Chitrakuta, one reaps welfare, and ignorance does not envelope one’s"
10992,SECTION LIV.,mind. There innumerable saints with the hair of their heads rendered
10993,SECTION LIV.,"white like skulls, having spent hundreds of years, have through"
10994,SECTION LIV.,austerities ascended heaven. That solitary spot I deem as one which will
10995,SECTION LIV.,"make a happy residence for thee. O Rāma, do thou, for living out the"
10996,SECTION LIV.,"term of thy banishment, dwell either here or with me."" Bharadwāja"
10997,SECTION LIV.,"entertained his welcome guest, Rāma, along with his wife and brother by"
10998,SECTION LIV.,extending towards them every rite of hospitality. And at Prayāga Rāma
10999,SECTION LIV.,"having obtained the company of that Maharshi, and discoursing on a"
11000,SECTION LIV.,"variety of sacred topics, the night came on. And with Sitā for the"
11001,SECTION LIV.,"third, Kākutstha brought up in luxury, being fatigued, pleasantly spent"
11002,SECTION LIV.,that night at the romantic hermitage of Bharadwāja. When the night had
11003,SECTION LIV.,"passed away and day dawned, (Rāma) approached Bharadwāja, and that chief"
11004,SECTION LIV.,"of men addressed that ascetic of flaming energy,—""O reverend sire of"
11005,SECTION LIV.,"truthful character, we have here in thy asylum spent the night. Do thou"
11006,SECTION LIV.,"now permit us to set forward (for Chitrakuta)."" On Rāma having passed"
11007,SECTION LIV.,"the night there, Bharadwāja spoke unto him,—""Do thou trace thy steps to"
11008,SECTION LIV.,"Chitrakuta filled with delicious fruits and roots. I deem that, O mighty"
11009,SECTION LIV.,"Rāma, as a fit abode for thee, being, as it is, furnished with various"
11010,SECTION LIV.,"kinds of trees, inhabited by crowds of Kinnaras, resounding with the"
11011,SECTION LIV.,"cries of peacocks, and frequented by gignantic elephants. Do thou repair"
11012,SECTION LIV.,"unto the famed Chitrakuta, holy, fair to the view, and abounding in"
11013,SECTION LIV.,countless fruits and roots. And in those forests range herds of
11014,SECTION LIV.,"elephants and deer; and these, O Rāghava, thou wilt behold. And ranging"
11015,SECTION LIV.,"with Sitā rivers and rills and plateaus, caverns and fountains, thy mind"
11016,SECTION LIV.,will experience delight. Delighted with the notes of joyous Koyastivas
11017,SECTION LIV.,"and coels, and the cries of deer and countless mad elephants, do thou,"
11018,SECTION LIV.,"arriving at the auspicious mountain, reside at that romantic asylum."""

11030,SECTION LV.,"after paying their obeisance unto the Maharshi, set out for the"

11032,SECTION LV.,"propitiatory ceremony for them, even as a father does on behalf of the"
11033,SECTION LV.,"sons begot from his own loins. And that mighty ascetic, Bharadwāja"
11034,SECTION LV.,"having truth for his prowess, addressed them, saying,—""O best of men, do"
11035,SECTION LV.,you coming to the confluence of the Gangā and the Yamunā proceed along
11036,SECTION LV.,the Kālindi river flowing westwards. Arriving at the Kālindi running in
11037,SECTION LV.,"a contrary direction, you will, O Rāghava, behold a goodly bathing place"
11038,SECTION LV.,"well-worn by foot-passengers. There constructing a raft, do you cross"
11039,SECTION LV.,over the river who is the daughter of the Sun. Next coming to a gigantic
11040,SECTION LV.,"banian tree with green foliage, named Syāma, surrounded by various trees"
11041,SECTION LV.,"and inhabited by ascetics of accomplished purposes, let Sitā with joined"
11042,SECTION LV.,"hands offer humble supplications to it. Having come to the tree and,"
11043,SECTION LV.,"whether staying under it or proceeding along, after passing only a"
11044,SECTION LV.,"_Krosa_, you will, O Rāma, see a wood abounding in Sallakis, Vadaris,"
11045,SECTION LV.,and other wild trees belonging unto the Yamunā. I went to Chitrakuta
11046,SECTION LV.,"many a time by that road, which is beautiful, sandy, and free from"
11047,SECTION LV.,"forest-fire."" Having directed the way, the Maharshi paused. Thereupon"
11048,SECTION LV.,"Rāma, saying,—""So be it"" asked him to stop. On the ascetic turning away,"
11049,SECTION LV.,"Rāma spoke unto Lakshmana, ""We had surely acquired religious merit, good"
11050,SECTION LV.,"betide you, since, the ascetic has shown compassion unto us."" Having"
11051,SECTION LV.,"thus conversed with each other, those foremost of men endowed with"
11052,SECTION LV.,"intelligence, placing Sitā in their front, proceeded towards the river"
11053,SECTION LV.,"Kālindi. And having arrived at the Kālindi of rapid currents, they"
11054,SECTION LV.,"desirous of crossing over, began I think (as to the means). Then with"
11055,SECTION LV.,"heaps of dry wild wood covered with grass, they constructed a large"
11056,SECTION LV.,raft. And the puissant Lakshmana tearing twigs from the ratan and the
11057,SECTION LV.,"rose-apple, made a comfortable seat for Sitā. Then Daçarātha’s son,"
11058,SECTION LV.,"Rāma, made his bashful wife (in power) inconceivable like unto Sree"
11059,SECTION LV.,"herself, ascend the raft, and carefully laid beside Vaidehi her attires"
11060,SECTION LV.,and ornaments as well as the hoe and the basket. And first having placed
11061,SECTION LV.,"Sitā on the raft, those sons of Daçarātha ascended themselves, and with"
11062,SECTION LV.,glad hearts began carefully to cross (the stream). Having come near the
11063,SECTION LV.,"middle of the Kālindi, Sitā prayed unto her, saying, —""Hail to thee, O"
11064,SECTION LV.,"goddess! I cross thee. If my husband can successfully perform his vow, I"
11065,SECTION LV.,"will worship thee with a thousand cows and an hundred vessels of wine,"
11066,SECTION LV.,"hail unto thee, upon Rāma’s return to the city ruled by Ikshwāku."""
11067,SECTION LV.,"Having thus prayed to Kālindi with joined hands, that virtuous lady,"
11068,SECTION LV.,"Sitā, reached the southern bank thereof. And by means of that raft they"
11069,SECTION LV.,"crossed that fleet-coursing daughter of the Sun, heaving with"
11070,SECTION LV.,billows—the river Yamunā with her banks abounding with innumerable
11071,SECTION LV.,"trees. Then renouncing the raft, and passing by the woods adjoining the"
11072,SECTION LV.,"Yamunā, they came upon a banian Syamā by name, of cool shade and verdant"
11073,SECTION LV.,"foliage. On coming to the banian, Vaidehi saluted it saying,—""O mighty"
11074,SECTION LV.,"tree, I bow unto thee. May my husband fulfil his vow; and may we behold"
11075,SECTION LV.,"Kauçalyā and the illustrious Sumitrā."" Having thus prayed with joined"
11076,SECTION LV.,"hands, the intelligent Sitā went away. Seeing the blameless and beloved"
11077,SECTION LV.,"Sitā ever conducting herself properly,—praying, Rāma said unto"
11078,SECTION LV.,"Lakshmana, ""Do thou, O younger brother of Bharata, taking Sitā with"
11079,SECTION LV.,"thee, go forward. O best of men, furnished with weapons, I will go in"

11082,SECTION LV.,"crowned with blossoms unseen before, that one belonging to the softer"
11083,SECTION LV.,"sex questioned Rāma about it. And hearing Sitā’s words, Lakshmana"
11084,SECTION LV.,brought unto her (fruits and flowers) of beautiful and flower-scattering
11085,SECTION LV.,trees of divers kinds. And beholding streams with water flowing over
11086,SECTION LV.,"glittering sands and resounding with cranes of various kinds, the"
11087,SECTION LV.,daughter of king Janaka felt exceeding delight. And having proceeded
11088,SECTION LV.,"just a _Krosa_, those brothers, Rāma and Lakshmana, having killed many a"
11089,SECTION LV.,"sacred deer, began to range in the woods of the Yamunā. And having"
11090,SECTION LV.,disported in the beautiful woods resounding with multitudes of peacocks

11102,SECTION LVI.,"foes, the time of our departure is present."" Awakened at the proper"
11103,SECTION LVI.,"time, Rāma’s brother left off sleep and drowsiness and clinging fatigue."
11104,SECTION LVI.,"Then they all arising touched the sacred waters of the river, and began"
11105,SECTION LVI.,to proceed on the way to Chitrakuta inhabited by ascetics. Setting out
11106,SECTION LVI.,"in season with Sumitrā’s son, he of eyes resembling lotus-petals spoke"
11107,SECTION LVI.,"these words unto Sitā,—""O Vaidehi, behold these flowering trees, the"
11108,SECTION LVI.,"Kinsukas in spring appearing engarlanded with their own flowers, and as"
11109,SECTION LVI.,if flaming.—Do thou behold the Bhallātakas and Vilwas bending beneath
11110,SECTION LVI.,"their fruits and flowers, with no man to enjoy them. Surely, we shall be"
11111,SECTION LVI.,"able to live here. Behold, O Lakshmana, these honeycombs measuring about"
11112,SECTION LVI.,a _Drona_ have been hung up on trees by the bees. In the charming woods
11113,SECTION LVI.,"overarched by flowers, the _Dātyuha_ cries, and is responded to by the"
11114,SECTION LVI.,peacock. Do thou behold Chitrakuta frequented by mad elephants and
11115,SECTION LVI.,resonant with the voice of multitudes of birds—the mountain with its
11116,SECTION LVI.,"towering summits. O child, we will disport in the sacred woods of"
11117,SECTION LVI.,"Chitrakuta with fine level plains,and covered with divers trees."" Then"
11118,SECTION LVI.,"they proceeding on foot along with Sitā, arrived at the charming and"
11119,SECTION LVI.,beautiful mountain Chitrakuta. And arriving at the mountain inhabited by
11120,SECTION LVI.,"birds of various kinds, abounding in fruits and roots, and furnished"
11121,SECTION LVI.,"with watery expanses, (Rāma) said, ""O amiable one, methinks this"
11122,SECTION LVI.,"beautiful hill furnished with innumerable fruits and roots, is fraught"
11123,SECTION LVI.,with subsistence. And the hill is inhabited by high-souled ascetics. Let
11124,SECTION LVI.,"this, O child, be our abode. We will dwell here."" Then Rāma, Lakshmana"
11125,SECTION LVI.,and Sitā with joined hands presented themselves at the asylum of Valmiki
11126,SECTION LVI.,and saluted him. Thereat the Maharshi cognizant of morality said unto
11127,SECTION LVI.,"them, ""Be seated!"" and addressed Rāma, saying,—""Has thy journey been a"
11128,SECTION LVI.,"pleasant one?"" Then having duly acquainted the saint with matters"
11129,SECTION LVI.,"pertaining to himself, that lord, the mighty- armed elder brother of"
11130,SECTION LVI.,"Lakshmana, said unto the latter, ""O Lakshmana, bring thou wood good and"
11131,SECTION LVI.,"strong. O amiable one, construct a dwelling. My mind is set upon staying"
11132,SECTION LVI.,"here."" Hearing his words, Sumitrā’s son procured wood of various"
11133,SECTION LVI.,"descriptions, and then that subduer of foes reared a cottage thatched"
11134,SECTION LVI.,with leaves. Beholding that goodly dwelling walled with wood and
11135,SECTION LVI.,"furnished with doors, Rāma addressed these words unto Lakshmana, intent"
11136,SECTION LVI.,"upon ministering unto his brother. ""Procuring meat, we will worship the"
11137,SECTION LVI.,"deity presiding over this dwelling. O Sumitrā’s son, those who wish to"
11138,SECTION LVI.,"live long, should pacify the household gods. O Lakshmana graced with"
11139,SECTION LVI.,"auspicious eyes, do thou killing deer, swiftly bring it here. It behoves"
11140,SECTION LVI.,us to observe the rules prescribed by the scriptures. Do thou follow the
11141,SECTION LVI.,"ordinance."" Acquainted with the words of his brother, Lakshmana, slayer"
11142,SECTION LVI.,"of hostile heroes, did as he was told. Thereupon Rāma addressed him"
11143,SECTION LVI.,"again, ""Do thou cook this meat. We will worship the presiding deities of"
11144,SECTION LVI.,"this mansion. Bestir thyself,—the moment is mild and the day is styled"
11145,SECTION LVI.,"_Dhruva_."" Then Lakshmana the son of Sumitrā endowed with vigor, having"
11146,SECTION LVI.,"slain a sacred black deer, threw it into flaming fire. And seeing it"
11147,SECTION LVI.,"well scorched and hot and free from blood, Lakshmana spoke unto that"
11148,SECTION LVI.,"foremost of men, Rāghava, saying,—""Here is the entire black deer roasted"
11149,SECTION LVI.,"by me, capable of serving any purpose. Do you, O you that resemble a"
11150,SECTION LVI.,"celestial, worship the gods."" Having performed his ablutions, Rāma"
11151,SECTION LVI.,"conversant with the ritual and possessing a knowledge of _Japa_,"
11152,SECTION LVI.,"restraining his senses, performed all the _mantras_ that are necessary"
11153,SECTION LVI.,for completing a sacrifice; and having in a pure spirit communed with

11155,SECTION LVI.,Rāma of immeasurable energy rejoiced exceedingly. And sacrificing unto
11156,SECTION LVI.,"Vaicya, Rudra and Vishnu, he performed some ceremonies for removing"
11157,SECTION LVI.,malign influences from the abode. And having duly performed _Japa_ and
11158,SECTION LVI.,"bathed in consonance with the ordinance, Rāma made an excellent"
11159,SECTION LVI.,"sacrifice for removing sin. And then Rāghava established a dais, and a"

11200,SECTION LVII.,"Having thus reflected, the charioteer drawing up to the city- gate by"

11206,SECTION LVII.,"rest) had crossed over (the Gangā), the men with tears in their eyes,"
11207,SECTION LVII.,"sighed forth ""O fie!"" and began to bewail, exclaiming, ""Ah Rāma."" And he"
11208,SECTION LVII.,"heard crowds exclaim,—""Not seeing Rāma in the car, we cease to exist. We"
11209,SECTION LVII.,shall no longer see the righteous Rāma in the midst of mighty assemblies

11212,SECTION LVII.,"in?—(constantly revolving all this in his mind), Rāma ruled this city"
11213,SECTION LVII.,"even as, a father. Then proceeding past the stalls, Sumantra heard the"
11214,SECTION LVII.,"lamentations of females at windows, burning in grief for Rāma. With his"
11215,SECTION LVII.,"face muffled, Sumantra proceeded on the highway towards the palace of"
11216,SECTION LVII.,Daçarātha. Swiftly alighting from the car and entering the royal
11217,SECTION LVII.,"residence, he went past seven apartments thronged with people. And"
11218,SECTION LVII.,"beholding Sumantra returned to the city crowned with edifices, seven-"
11219,SECTION LVII.,"storied houses, and palatial mansions, the women, stricken with the"
11220,SECTION LVII.,"absence of Rāma, set up a cry of ""Oh"" and ""Alas."" And waxing still more"
11221,SECTION LVII.,"aggrieved, the females looked at each other with their expansive and"
11222,SECTION LVII.,"transparent eyes fast flooded with tears. And then he heard the talk, as"
11223,SECTION LVII.,"toned down it proceeded from the royal mansions, of the wives of"
11224,SECTION LVII.,"Daçarātha afflicted with grief for Rāma. ""Going in company with Rāma,"

11226,SECTION LVII.,"bewailing (for her son)? Surely life is miserable, yet is incapable of"
11227,SECTION LVII.,"being renounced, since, although her son leaving (the installation) hath"
11228,SECTION LVII.,"gone away, yet Kauçalyā still liveth."" Having heard those words of the"
11229,SECTION LVII.,"queens, fraught with truth, Sumantra burning as it were in grief, at"
11230,SECTION LVII.,once entered the (next) apartment. And entering the eighth apartment he
11231,SECTION LVII.,"beheld in a gloomy chamber the king distressed and in a pitiable plight,"

11245,SECTION LVII.,"from fear of whom you do not speak to the charioteer, Kaikeyi, is not"
11246,SECTION LVII.,"here. Do you therefore speak to him without fear."" Having said this unto"

11268,SECTION LVIII.,"eyes, and in pitiable guise, ""Where stayeth that righteous one, taking"
11269,SECTION LVIII.,"refuge under a tree? Lapped in luxury, what, O charioteer, will Rāghava"
11270,SECTION LVIII.,"feed on? Unworthy of privations, and worthy of excellent beds, how, O"
11271,SECTION LVIII.,"Sumantra, a king’s son, he is sleeping on the ground like one forlorn?"
11272,SECTION LVIII.,How is Rāma passing his days in the lone forest—he who when he went out
11273,SECTION LVIII.,used to be followed by foot-men and elephants? How are the princes in

11275,SECTION LVIII.,"and inhabited by black snakes? How, O Sumantra, having descended from"
11276,SECTION LVIII.,"the car, the princes along with the tender and unfortunate Sitā are"
11277,SECTION LVIII.,"proceeding on foot? O charioteer, surely thou art blessed, for thou hast"
11278,SECTION LVIII.,"beheld my sons enter the forest, like the Açwins entering the Mandara"
11279,SECTION LVIII.,"hill. And what did Rāma say? And what did Lakshmana? And, O Sumantra,"
11280,SECTION LVIII.,"arriving at the forest what did Mithilā’s daughter? Do thou, O"
11281,SECTION LVIII.,"charioteer, describe unto me what Rāma lives on and where he lies down."
11282,SECTION LVIII.,"Hearing this, I shall live, like Yayati in the midst of saints."" Thus"
11283,SECTION LVIII.,"urged by the king, the charioteer spoke unto the king with his voice"
11284,SECTION LVIII.,"faltering and suppressed with the vapour of grief, ""O mighty monarch"
11285,SECTION LVIII.,"observing morality, Rāghava with joined hands and bowing down his head,"
11286,SECTION LVIII.,"said, ’O charioteer, do thou in my name salute with thy head the feet of"

11296,SECTION LVIII.,"do you bear yourself towards my mothers. And, O mother, do you show"
11297,SECTION LVIII.,"respect unto Kaikeyi, who is followed by the king himself. And you"
11298,SECTION LVIII.,should behave towards Bharata as one should towards one’s king. Kings
11299,SECTION LVIII.,"(although juvenile), are really senior by virtue of their royalty; and"

11330,SECTION LVIII.,"looking up to her lord with a blank countenance, she suddenly let fail"

11350,SECTION LIX.,"range about; and the forest appears to be dumb, stupified by grief on"

11356,SECTION LIX.,"idle with their birds drooping. And, O best of men, I do not find the"
11357,SECTION LIX.,"bowers beautiful (as before). And when I entered Ayodhyā, none greeted"

11374,SECTION LIX.,"sinful race and cherishing sinful designs, I did not take counsel with"
11375,SECTION LIX.,aged people capable of offering advice. Without consulting with friends
11376,SECTION LIX.,"or courtiers or persons versed in the Vedas, I have in the interests of"
11377,SECTION LIX.,"a woman rashly done this thing through ignorance. Meseems, O charioteer,"
11378,SECTION LIX.,"for the purpose of destroying this line entirely, this mighty disaster"
11379,SECTION LIX.,"hath surely befallen us through the influence of Destiny. O charioteer,"
11380,SECTION LIX.,"if I have ever done thee any good, do thou immediately take me to Rāma:"
11381,SECTION LIX.,my life urges me on (in this direction). Or let my command make Rāghava
11382,SECTION LIX.,turn back. I cannot live for a moment without Rāma. But if that
11383,SECTION LIX.,"mighty-armed one has proceeded far, do thou placing me on a car speedily"
11384,SECTION LIX.,show me unto Rāma. Where is that elder brother of Lakshmana of a mighty
11385,SECTION LIX.,"bow, furnished with teeth resembling Kunda flowers? If I live so long, I"
11386,SECTION LIX.,"will behold him in company with Sitā. What can be sadder than this, that"

11389,SECTION LIX.,Vaidehi! You do not know that I am through grief lamenting like one
11390,SECTION LIX.,"deserted."" Deprived of his consciousness through that sorrow of his, the"
11391,SECTION LIX.,"king said, ""I have plunged myself into this ocean of woe hard to cross,"
11392,SECTION LIX.,"with grief for Rāma as its mighty tide; separation from Sitā, its other"
11393,SECTION LIX.,"shore; sighs heaved, its furious billows and whirlpools; tears, rivers"
11394,SECTION LIX.,"that rush into it; tossing of the arms, its fishes; lamentations its"

11397,SECTION LIX.,"terrific ravenous animals; the boon, its continents; and the exile of"
11398,SECTION LIX.,"Rāma, its expanse. And, O Kauçalyā, without Rāghava, I shall sink in"
11399,SECTION LIX.,"this ocean. O exalted dame, living, it is hard for me to cross over this"
11400,SECTION LIX.,ocean. It is surely owing to my sin that today wishing to behold Rāghava
11401,SECTION LIX.,"and Lakshmana, I do not get them (before me)."" Having thus lamented, the"

11416,SECTION LX.,delay turn the car. Do thou take me also unto Dandaka. If I do not

11419,SECTION LX.,"words faltering and choked with rising vapour, ""Do you leave grief and"
11420,SECTION LX.,"sorrow and the violent emotion. Renouncing grief, Rāghava is living in"
11421,SECTION LX.,"the woods. And in the forest, the righteous Lakshmana, having his senses"
11422,SECTION LX.,"under control, is ministering unto Rāma’s feet and is thus adoring the"
11423,SECTION LX.,"gods for happiness in the next world. And even in the lonely woods, Sitā"
11424,SECTION LX.,"as if remaining at home, having fixed her thoughts on Rāma, is living a"
11425,SECTION LX.,life of love. And there appears not the least trace of any distress
11426,SECTION LX.,afflicting her; and Vaidehi seems to me as if she were meant (by Nature)
11427,SECTION LX.,for a life away from home. And as formerly going unto urban villas she
11428,SECTION LX.,"disported, she disports now even in the lonely forest. And although"
11429,SECTION LX.,"living in the lone forest, that one of a countenance resembling the"
11430,SECTION LX.,"infant moon, sports merrily like a girl, in the garden represented by"
11431,SECTION LX.,Rāma’s self. Ayodhyā without Rāma would have seemed a wilderness to her
11432,SECTION LX.,whose heart is fixed on him and whose very life depends upon him.
11433,SECTION LX.,Vaidehi is now asking (Rāma) concerning the villages and towns (in their

11435,SECTION LX.,"asking Rāma or Lakshmana (for information), is learning all about them."
11436,SECTION LX.,And Sitā sports as she used to do in arbours stationed at the distance
11437,SECTION LX.,of only one _krosa_ from Ayodhyā. This only I remember; but all that she
11438,SECTION LX.,"had from sudden impulse communicated unto me concerning Kaikeyi, does"
11439,SECTION LX.,"not rise into consciousness."" Suppressing this topic which had come up"
11440,SECTION LX.,"through heedlessness, the charioteer spoke sweet words cheering up that"
11441,SECTION LX.,"noble lady. ""Neither through the fatigue of travel, nor the influence of"
11442,SECTION LX.,"the wind, nor excitement, nor the sun, hath Vaidehi’s lustre resembling"
11443,SECTION LX.,the lunar light suffered any diminution. The countenance of that
11444,SECTION LX.,fair-speaking one resembling the lotus and comparable unto the full moon
11445,SECTION LX.,"in splendour, hath not waxed pale. Her feet now without the dye of the"
11446,SECTION LX.,"liquid lac, but naturally furnished with the roseate hue of the same,"
11447,SECTION LX.,are gorgeous like lotus buds. Still Vaidehi decked in ornaments from
11448,SECTION LX.,"affection for Rāma, goes gracefully, rebuking with her bangles the wavy"
11449,SECTION LX.,"gait (of cranes). Supporting herself on Rāma’s arm, Sitā arrived at the"
11450,SECTION LX.,"forest, is not inspired with fear on beholding either an elephant, or a"
11451,SECTION LX.,"lion, or a tiger. Therefore they are not to be bewailed, nor your own"
11452,SECTION LX.,"self, nor the lord of men. This history of Rāma will endure for ever in"
11453,SECTION LX.,"this world. Renouncing grief and with cheerful hearts, well established"
11454,SECTION LX.,"in the life led by the Maharshis, they living in the forest on wild"
11455,SECTION LX.,"fruits as their sustenance, are maintaining the noble promise of their"
11456,SECTION LX.,"sire."" Consoled by the truth-telling yet sweeet- speeched charioteer,"

11487,SECTION LXI.,"occasions of the Srāddha (first) feast their own friends, and having"
11488,SECTION LXI.,"done this, they mind the choice Brāhmanas. But those twice-born ones"
11489,SECTION LXI.,"that are meritorious, learned, and like unto celestials, do not at the"

11492,SECTION LXI.,"the other twice- born ones have been feasted, even as bulls never"
11493,SECTION LXI.,quietly bear to have their horns cut off. Why will not an elder brother
11494,SECTION LXI.,"and one who has sterling merits, O monarch, disregard a kingdom which"
11495,SECTION LXI.,hath been thus enjoyed by his younger brother? A tiger doth not like to
11496,SECTION LXI.,feed on food procured by others. Even so that tiger-like personage does
11497,SECTION LXI.,not regard anything that has come to be tasted by another. Clarified
11498,SECTION LXI.,"butter, sacrificial cakes, Kuça, stakes of catechu having been used in"
11499,SECTION LXI.,"one sacrifice cannot be used in another,—even so this kingdom which hath"
11500,SECTION LXI.,"been already enjoyed, like unto liquor deprived of its essence or a"
11501,SECTION LXI.,"sacrifice whose _soma_ hath been eaten, cannot be accepted by Rāma. Such"
11502,SECTION LXI.,"an ill treatment Rāghava will not put up with, even as a powerful tiger"
11503,SECTION LXI.,cannot bear the rubbing of its tail (by another). This world aided by
11504,SECTION LXI.,the gods fear to encounter him in high conflict; but he restrains
11505,SECTION LXI.,"himself, thinking any such action on his part as unrighteous. Indeed,"
11506,SECTION LXI.,"that righteous one brings back people to morality. Surely, that"
11507,SECTION LXI.,"mighty-armed one endowed with exceeding prowess, can with his golden"
11508,SECTION LXI.,"shafts burn all creatures and the oceans, like the Day at the"
11509,SECTION LXI.,"dissolution of all. But such a man of men, possessed of leonine"
11510,SECTION LXI.,"strength, and graced with the eyes of a bull, has been destroyed by his"
11511,SECTION LXI.,"father, like a fish destroying his offspring. If you had believed in the"
11512,SECTION LXI.,"morality prescribed in the scriptures, and which is followed by the"
11513,SECTION LXI.,"twice-born ones, you would not have banished your son. But disregarding"
11514,SECTION LXI.,"such morality, you have banished your virtuous son. One of the refuges"
11515,SECTION LXI.,"of a woman is her husband, a second is her son, and a third is her"
11516,SECTION LXI.,relatives; and a fourth she has none. But you cease to be mine; and Rāma
11517,SECTION LXI.,has been sent to the woods. I do not like to go into the forest; so I am

11555,SECTION LXII.,"being extolled in both the worlds. I know duty, O righteous one; I know"
11556,SECTION LXII.,that thou art truth-telling. And it is because I was exceedingly
11557,SECTION LXII.,distressed on account of my son that I spoke harshly to thee. Sorrow
11558,SECTION LXII.,"destroys patience, sorrow destroys knowledge of the scriptures, sorrow"
11559,SECTION LXII.,destroys every thing; there is no enemy like unto sorrow. One can

11604,SECTION LXIII.,"lady, thou wert then unwedded; and I was a youthful prince. And it was"
11605,SECTION LXIII.,at this time that the rainy season increasing my desire set in. Drawing
11606,SECTION LXIII.,"moisture from the ground and heated the earth by his rays, the Sun goes"
11607,SECTION LXIII.,to the dreadful quarter whither repair the dead. The heat was
11608,SECTION LXIII.,"immediately dispelled, and the gelid clouds showed themselves; and frogs"
11609,SECTION LXIII.,"and Sārangas and peacocks began to rejoice; and, finding it unpleasant,"
11610,SECTION LXIII.,the feathered ones bathed and with the surface of their plumage shrunk
11611,SECTION LXIII.,"up from the wet, took refuge in trees shaken by the wind and rain. And"
11612,SECTION LXIII.,"the hill graced by maddened Sārangas, covered by showers falling"
11613,SECTION LXIII.,simultaneously looked like a mass of waters. And the waters although
11614,SECTION LXIII.,"unstained, being mixed up with mineral substances and ashes from the"
11615,SECTION LXIII.,"mountain, flowed in serpentine torrents black and red. At such a sweet"
11616,SECTION LXIII.,"hour, I intent upon taking excercise, taking my bow and arrows and"
11617,SECTION LXIII.,"mounted on my car, sallied out for the river Sarayu, with the intention"
11618,SECTION LXIII.,"that I with my senses under control, should in the watery expense slay"
11619,SECTION LXIII.,"any bufifelo, elephant, or any other beast that might have come there in"
11620,SECTION LXIII.,the night. And (coming there) while it was so dark that nothing could be
11621,SECTION LXIII.,"discovered, I heard sounds of a filling pitcher proceeding from the"
11622,SECTION LXIII.,waters; resembling the roars of an elephant. Thereupon raising up my
11623,SECTION LXIII.,"shaft flaming and like unto a serpent of virulent poison, I desirous of"
11624,SECTION LXIII.,"hunting the (imaginary) elephant, let fly my shaft in the direction of"
11625,SECTION LXIII.,the sound. Thereupon from the spot whereto the sharpened shaft
11626,SECTION LXIII.,"resembling a poisonous snake had been discharged by me in the twilight,"
11627,SECTION LXIII.,proceeded cries of ’Oh’ and ’Alas’ uttered by a forester pierced to the
11628,SECTION LXIII.,"quick by the arrow, and falling into the water. And when he had dropped"
11629,SECTION LXIII.,"down, words spoken by a human being became audible. ’Why doth the weapon"
11630,SECTION LXIII.,light upon me? I had come to this lone stream for procuring water. By
11631,SECTION LXIII.,whom have I been wounded by this arrow? To whom have I done wrong? And
11632,SECTION LXIII.,"how can the slaying of one like me bearing a load of matted locks, and"
11633,SECTION LXIII.,"wearing bark and deer-skin, who subsists on what the forest yields and"
11634,SECTION LXIII.,"never injures others, be sanctioned by the scriptures? Who can serve any"
11635,SECTION LXIII.,purpose by slaying me? And how can I have injured such an one? Such a
11636,SECTION LXIII.,purposeless act cannot but end in evil. This can never be reckoned as
11637,SECTION LXIII.,righteous; even like unto violating the chastity of a preceptor’s wife.
11638,SECTION LXIII.,I do not so much lament my end as I lament it on account of my father
11639,SECTION LXIII.,"and mother. To what will the old couple, who have ever been maintained"
11640,SECTION LXIII.,"by me, betake themselves when I am gone? My father and mother are old,"
11641,SECTION LXIII.,and I their only son am slain. What boy is it of uncontrolled senses
11642,SECTION LXIII.,"that has killed us all?"""
11643,SECTION LXIII.,
11644,SECTION LXIII.,"""Hearing his piteous words, I ever anxious to follow virtue, was"
11645,SECTION LXIII.,"exceedingly pained, and the bow with its arrow fixed fell down from my"
11646,SECTION LXIII.,"hand to the earth. Hearing in the night, the pathetic words of the saint"
11647,SECTION LXIII.,"thus lamenting, I became frightened, and was deprived of my senses"
11648,SECTION LXIII.,"through excess of grief. And coming to the quarter, I exceedingly"
11649,SECTION LXIII.,"unnerved and with an excited mind, discovered on the banks of the Sarayu"
11650,SECTION LXIII.,"an ascetic wounded with a shaft, with his matted locks scattered about,"
11651,SECTION LXIII.,"his pitcher of water lying by, his body smeared with blood and dust and"
11652,SECTION LXIII.,afflicted by the dart. Gazing with his eyes at me who was extremely
11653,SECTION LXIII.,"agitated and ill at ease, he said these words sternly, as if consuming"
11654,SECTION LXIII.,"me with his energy, ’What wrong, O monarch, had I residing in the woods"
11655,SECTION LXIII.,"done thee, that coming to procure water for my parents, I have been thus"
11656,SECTION LXIII.,"afflicted by thee? By piercing my marrow with a shaft, thou hast slain"
11657,SECTION LXIII.,"both my aged and blind father and mother. Surely, they feeble and blind,"
11658,SECTION LXIII.,"who afflicted by thirst are remaining in expectation of me, will now"
11659,SECTION LXIII.,bear (the stress and tension of) the expectation as well as the parching
11660,SECTION LXIII.,"thirst. Surely asceticism and study carry no fruit with them, since I"
11661,SECTION LXIII.,"lying low on the ground, my father knows nothing about it. And what"
11662,SECTION LXIII.,"could he do, even if he knew it, being as he is incapable and unable to"
11663,SECTION LXIII.,go about? One tree cannot rescue another that is being batttered (by the
11664,SECTION LXIII.,"winds). Do thou, O descendant of Raghu, thyself going to my father,"
11665,SECTION LXIII.,speedily inform of him this that has occurred. But take care that like a
11666,SECTION LXIII.,"fire waxing furious consuming a wood, he in his ire do not burn thee."
11667,SECTION LXIII.,"This narrow way, O king, will lead thee unto my father’s dwelling. Do"
11668,SECTION LXIII.,"thou going there, pacify him, so that getting wroth he may not curse"
11669,SECTION LXIII.,"thee. Do thou (now), O king, take out the arrow. Thy sharpened shaft"
11670,SECTION LXIII.,"afflicts my marrow, like the tide of a river wearing away a"
11671,SECTION LXIII.,"hollow-heaving sand bank.’ But touching the extracting of the arrow,"
11672,SECTION LXIII.,"this thought perplexed me: ’If the arrow is left alone, it pains; if"
11673,SECTION LXIII.,"extracted, death ensues.’ As I was distressed, aggrieved and inflicted"
11674,SECTION LXIII.,"with sorrow, the son of the ascetic perceived my anxiety. Thereupon that"
11675,SECTION LXIII.,"one well versed in the scriptures sinking motionless, with his eyes"
11676,SECTION LXIII.,"rolling upwards, and waxing extremely weak, said with difficulty,"
11677,SECTION LXIII.,"’Restraining sorrow, I by dint of patience become calm. Do thou remove"
11678,SECTION LXIII.,from thy mind the grief caused by the consciousness of having slain a
11679,SECTION LXIII.,"Brāhmana. O king, I belong not to the twice-born race: let not thy mind"
11680,SECTION LXIII.,"be pained. O lord of the foremost men, I was begot by a Vaicya on a"

11682,SECTION LXIII.,"rolling, inert and trembling on the ground, with his limbs drawn in, was"
11683,SECTION LXIII.,"speaking with difficulty, I drew out the arrow. Thereupon, looking at"
11684,SECTION LXIII.,"me, the ascetic, growing affrighted, gave up the ghost. On beholding him"
11685,SECTION LXIII.,"with his body dripping with water, and mortally wounded, and breathing"
11686,SECTION LXIII.,"hard without respite, after he had bewailed his mortal wound, lying on"

11717,SECTION LXIV.,"of my mind by assuming a doughty tongue, communicated unto him the"
11718,SECTION LXIV.,danger that had beffallen him in consequence of the calamity of his son:
11719,SECTION LXIV.,"’I am a Kshatria, Daçarātha (by name), and no son of thine, O"

11722,SECTION LXIV.,"prey, an elephant (or some other), come to the waters, I went to the"
11723,SECTION LXIV.,banks of the Sarayu bow in hand. Then hearing sounds from the water of a
11724,SECTION LXIV.,"filling pitcher, I thought,—This must be an elephant.—I wounded it with"

11729,SECTION LXIV.,"And as soon as the arrow had been extracted, he ascended heaven, O"
11730,SECTION LXIV.,"reverend sir, lamenting and bewailing you, both grown old. It is through"
11731,SECTION LXIV.,"ignorance that I suddenly wounded your son. This having been past, do"

11735,SECTION LXIV.,"deprived of his senses by grief, that highly energetic one said unto me"

11890,SECTION LXV.,"not yet awaked. Deprived of lustre, pallid, stricken by sorrow, and"
11891,SECTION LXV.,"lying with her limbs contracted, Kauçalyā looked like a star enveloped"
11892,SECTION LXV.,"in darkness. And after Kauçalyā, the king, and after him, Sumitrā; and"
11893,SECTION LXV.,"with her countenance faded from grief, this noble lady did not look"
11894,SECTION LXV.,particularly lovely. Finding these two ladies asleep and the king
11895,SECTION LXV.,"seeming as if sleeping, the inmates of the inner apartment showed"
11896,SECTION LXV.,themselves as if their lives had departed out of them. Thereupon
11897,SECTION LXV.,"exceedingly distressed, those paragons of their sex, like she-elephants"
11898,SECTION LXV.,"in the forest deprived of their leader of the herd, broke out into"
11899,SECTION LXV.,"wailing. At the sounds of their lamentations, bpth Kauçalyā and Sumitrā"
11900,SECTION LXV.,"suddenly regaining consciousness, awoke from their sleep. And Kauçalyā"
11901,SECTION LXV.,"and Sumitrā looking at the king and feeling him, felt down to the earth,"
11902,SECTION LXV.,"exclaiming, ""Ah lord."" As the daughter of Koçala’s lord rolled on the"
11903,SECTION LXV.,"ground, she covered with dust did not appear in all her loveliness, like"
11904,SECTION LXV.,a star fallen from the sky to the earth below. And when the king had
11905,SECTION LXV.,"departed this life, the women saw Kauçalyā fallen on the earth like the"
11906,SECTION LXV.,slain mate of an elephant. Then all the wives of the monarch headed by
11907,SECTION LXV.,"Kaikeyi, burning with grief and weeping, were well nigh rendered"
11908,SECTION LXV.,"senseless. And the loud sounds emitted by these, mingling with those"
11909,SECTION LXV.,"(who had been lamenting before them), attained greater proportions and"
11910,SECTION LXV.,filled the hall. And the mansion of the king became filled with people
11911,SECTION LXV.,"exceedingly excited and frightened, eager to know all about the"
11912,SECTION LXV.,"matter,—became filled with lamentations, with friends afflicted with"
11913,SECTION LXV.,"distress, its joy instantaneously vanished—a scene of distress and dole."
11914,SECTION LXV.,"Knowing that the lord of earth had departed, his wives surrounding that"
11915,SECTION LXV.,"illustrious one, smitten with excess of sorrow and weeping bitterly and"
11916,SECTION LXV.,"piteously, holding the king’s hands indulged in lamentations, like"

11927,SECTION LXVI.,"with tears in her eyes, said, ""O Kaikeyi, attain thou thy wishes: do"

11936,SECTION LXVI.,"(so Kaikeyi) having done this evil through Mantharā’s incitement, does"
11937,SECTION LXVI.,not bring her guilt home to her mind. It is through the instrumentality
11938,SECTION LXVI.,of the hump-backed woman that this race of the Rāghavas has been
11939,SECTION LXVI.,destroyed by Kaikeyi. Hearing that the king being made to do an
11940,SECTION LXVI.,"unrighteous action, has banished Rāma together with his wife, king"
11941,SECTION LXVI.,Janaka will be filled with grief as I have been. That virtuous one does
11942,SECTION LXVI.,not know that to-day I have become helpless and been widowed. Rāma of
11943,SECTION LXVI.,eyes resembling lotus-petals has living been removed from my sight. The
11944,SECTION LXVI.,"fair daughter of Videha’s king unworthy of hardship, in ascetic guise is"
11945,SECTION LXVI.,leading a life of trouble and terror in the woods. Hearing at night the
11946,SECTION LXVI.,"dreadful roars of birds and beasts crying, she exceedingly frightened"
11947,SECTION LXVI.,"takes shelter with Rāghava. Old and having an only daughter, he"
11948,SECTION LXVI.,"revolving in his mind thoughts of Vaidehi, shall, smitten with grief,"
11949,SECTION LXVI.,surely renounce his life. I ever faithful to my lord will die this very
11950,SECTION LXVI.,"day, embracing this body; I will enter fire."" As embracing the (dead)"
11951,SECTION LXVI.,"body, that unfortunate lady was bewailing, the courtiers had the"
11952,SECTION LXVI.,distressed (queen) removed from there. Then placing the corpse of the
11953,SECTION LXVI.,"king in a (capacious) pan with oil, the courtiers performed the mourning"
11954,SECTION LXVI.,"rites of the monarch. But well versed in every thing, the counsellors,"
11955,SECTION LXVI.,"in the absence of his son, did not perform the funeral obsequies of the"

11957,SECTION LXVI.,"Alas! at length concluding it for certain that the king was dead, the"
11958,SECTION LXVI.,"ladies burst out into lamentations. And raising their arms, with tears"
11959,SECTION LXVI.,"trickling down their faces, they in dire affliction and extremely"
11960,SECTION LXVI.,"exercised with grief, lamented, ""O monarch, why do you forsake us, who"
11961,SECTION LXVI.,have been already deprived of Rāma ever speaking fair and firm in
11962,SECTION LXVI.,"promise? Renounced by Rāma, how shall ye, rendered widows, stay with the"
11963,SECTION LXVI.,"wicked Kaikeyi, co-wife with us? That one of free soul is our master, as"
11964,SECTION LXVI.,"he is the lord of yourself. Rāma has gone to the woods, forsaking regal"
11965,SECTION LXVI.,"dignity. Deprived of you as well as that hero, and overwhelmed with"
11966,SECTION LXVI.,"misfortune, how shall we live reprimanded by Kaikeyi? She that has"
11967,SECTION LXVI.,"renounced the king, Rāma, and Lakshmana along with Sitā— whom can such a"
11968,SECTION LXVI.,"one not renounce?"" Thus with tears in their eyes, the wives of that"
11969,SECTION LXVI.,"descendant of Raghu, joyless and convulsed with a huge passion,"
11970,SECTION LXVI.,"displayed signs of sorrow. Like a night without stars, like a fair one"
11971,SECTION LXVI.,"forsaken by her husband, the city of Ayodhyā without the magnanimous"
11972,SECTION LXVI.,"monarch did not appear delightful as it had done before, with the"
11973,SECTION LXVI.,"populace filled with tears, the ladies uttering exclamations of"

11975,SECTION LXVI.,"having ascended heaven from grief, and the wives of the king remaining"
11976,SECTION LXVI.,"on the earth, the sun, his journey done, set, and the night began her"

11978,SECTION LXVI.,son did not recommend itself to the assembled adherents (of the
11979,SECTION LXVI.,"departed). Thinking this, they in that way laid the king endowed with an"
11980,SECTION LXVI.,inconceivably dignified presence. And with her terraces overflowing with
11981,SECTION LXVI.,"tears that flooded the throats of the mourners, the city appeared like"
11982,SECTION LXVI.,"the welkin without its splendour in the absence of the sun, or the night"
11983,SECTION LXVI.,with the stars enveloped. And on the demise of that illustrious
11984,SECTION LXVI.,"personage, in the city men and women in multitudes, censuring Bharata’s"

11996,SECTION LXVII.,"Mārkandeya, Maudgalya, Vāmadeva, Kāçyapa, Kātyāyana, Gautama, and the"

11999,SECTION LXVII.,"eminent Vasistha, they said, ""That night that had appeared like unto an"
12000,SECTION LXVII.,hundred years has at last been painfully passed. The king racked by
12001,SECTION LXVII.,"sorrow for his son has breathed his last, the mighty monarch has"
12002,SECTION LXVII.,"ascended heaven, Rāma has taken refuge in the woods, the energetic"
12003,SECTION LXVII.,"Lakshmana has gone with Rāma, and both Bharata and Satrugna— repressors"
12004,SECTION LXVII.,"of foes—are staying in Kekaya in pleasant _Rajagriha_, the abode of"
12005,SECTION LXVII.,their maternal grandfather. Do you select some one this very day from
12006,SECTION LXVII.,"the descendants of Ikshwāku, be king here. Verily doth a kingdom go to"
12007,SECTION LXVII.,"ruin, when without a king. He that goes garlanded with lightning, and"
12008,SECTION LXVII.,"has a mighty voice, even the cloud—doth not with skyey shower drench the"
12009,SECTION LXVII.,Earth in a kingdom without a king. In a kingless kingdom no one sows
12010,SECTION LXVII.,"corn. In a kingless kingdom the son does not obey his sire, or the wife"
12011,SECTION LXVII.,"her husband. A kingless kingdom possesses no wealth, and wives are hard"
12012,SECTION LXVII.,to keep in such a place. This great fear attends a kingless country. And
12013,SECTION LXVII.,where is other morality (besides that detailed above) to be found at
12014,SECTION LXVII.,such a place? In a kingless country men do not form themselves into
12015,SECTION LXVII.,"associations, nor do they, inspired with cheerfulness, make elegant"
12016,SECTION LXVII.,"gardens or sacred edifices. In a kingless country, the twice-born ones"
12017,SECTION LXVII.,"do not celebrate sacrifices. In a kingless country, in mighty sacrifices"
12018,SECTION LXVII.,wealthy Brāhmanas do not confer (on the officiating priests) the
12019,SECTION LXVII.,"_dakshinās_ (which they receive according to the ordinance), In a"
12020,SECTION LXVII.,"kingless country, neither social gatherings, nor festivities"
12021,SECTION LXVII.,characterised by the presence of merry theatrical managers and
12022,SECTION LXVII.,"performers, increase. In a kingless country disputants cannot decide"
12023,SECTION LXVII.,their point; nor are persons given to hearing Purānic recitations
12024,SECTION LXVII.,"pleased by those delighting in the practice. In a kingless country,"
12025,SECTION LXVII.,bevies of virgins decked in gold do not repair to gardens for purposes
12026,SECTION LXVII.,"of sport. In a kingless country, the wealthy are not well protected; nor"
12027,SECTION LXVII.,do shepherds and cultivators sleep with their doors open. In a kingless
12028,SECTION LXVII.,country pleasure-seeking people do not in company with females go to the
12029,SECTION LXVII.,"woods by means of swift vehicles, In a kingless country long-tusked"
12030,SECTION LXVII.,"elephants sixty years old, bearing bells on their necks, do not walk the"
12031,SECTION LXVII.,highway. In a kingless country one hears not the clappings of persons
12032,SECTION LXVII.,engaged in shooting arrows constantly. In a kingless country traders
12033,SECTION LXVII.,"coming from distant lands, loaded with various kinds of merchandise, do"
12034,SECTION LXVII.,not with safety go along the roads. In a kingless country the ascetic
12035,SECTION LXVII.,"with his subdued senses, himself his sole protector, who makes his"
12036,SECTION LXVII.,"quarters wherever evening overtakes him, cannot walk contemplating the"
12037,SECTION LXVII.,"Deity. In a kingless country, one cannot protect what one has, or"
12038,SECTION LXVII.,"procure what one has not. In a kingless country, the forces cannot bear"
12039,SECTION LXVII.,the onslaught of the foe. In a kingless country men cannot at will go on
12040,SECTION LXVII.,excellent and high-mettled horses and ornamented cars. In a kingless
12041,SECTION LXVII.,"country persons well versed in learning can not engage in controversy,"
12042,SECTION LXVII.,"repairing to woods and groves. In a kingless country, persons with"
12043,SECTION LXVII.,"intent hearts do not offer garlands, sweets, and _dakshinās_, for"
12044,SECTION LXVII.,"worshipping the gods. In a kingless country, princes smeared with sandal"
12045,SECTION LXVII.,"and _aguru_, do not look graceful like trees in spring. Even as a river"
12046,SECTION LXVII.,"without water, a wood without grass, a herd of kine without a keeper, is"
12047,SECTION LXVII.,"a kingdom without a king. The sign of a car is its pennon, of fire is"
12048,SECTION LXVII.,"smoke, and our banner the king, has gone to heaven. In a kingless"
12049,SECTION LXVII.,country a person hardly preserves his life; and like fishes people eat
12050,SECTION LXVII.,up one another. Even those heretics who having disregarded the dignity
12051,SECTION LXVII.,"of social morality had met with chastisement at the hands of the king,"
12052,SECTION LXVII.,their fear removed—give themselves airs. As the sight is engaged in the
12053,SECTION LXVII.,"welfare of the body, the king—that fountain of truth and religion—is"
12054,SECTION LXVII.,"engaged in compassing the good of the kingdom. The king is truth, the"

12060,SECTION LXVII.,"and foul, darkness would overspread (the face of the earth) and people"

12079,SECTION LXVIII.,"Vijaya, and Jayanta, and Açokanandana. Do ye hear. I will tell you what"

12085,SECTION LXVIII.,"unto him the exile of Rāma, or the demise of the monarch, or the"
12086,SECTION LXVIII.,destruction that hath befallen the Raghu race through this occasion. Do
12087,SECTION LXVIII.,"ye, speedily taking silk apparel and excellent ornaments for king"
12088,SECTION LXVIII.,"Bharata, set off."" Thereupon, having been furnished with the necessaries"
12089,SECTION LXVIII.,"for the journey, they bound for Kekaya went to their respective abodes,"
12090,SECTION LXVIII.,mounted on goodly horses. Then having supplied themselves with the
12091,SECTION LXVIII.,"necessaries of the journey, the envoys in consonance with Vasistha’s"
12092,SECTION LXVIII.,"injunction, speedily went away. Having proceeded by the west of"
12093,SECTION LXVIII.,"Aparatāla, they in the middle crossed the Mālini, and went towards the"
12094,SECTION LXVIII.,"north of Pralamva. Then crossing the Gangā at Hastinapura, and arriving"
12095,SECTION LXVIII.,"at Pānchāla, they proceeded westward through Kurujāngala. And beholding"
12096,SECTION LXVIII.,"watery expanses filled with blown blossoms, and rivers containing"
12097,SECTION LXVIII.,"pellucid waters, the envoys proceeded apace on account of the errand"
12098,SECTION LXVIII.,they had on hand. And they darted past the Saradanda overflowing with
12099,SECTION LXVIII.,"delightful water, beautiful, and haunted by fowls of various kinds. Then"
12100,SECTION LXVIII.,"on the western bank of the stream, coming upon a tree called"
12101,SECTION LXVIII.,"Satyapayāchana presided by a deity, and bowing down unto the tree and"
12102,SECTION LXVIII.,"going round it, they entered the city of Kulinga. And having passed"
12103,SECTION LXVIII.,"Teyobibhabana and arrived at Abhikāla, they crossed the sacred stream"
12104,SECTION LXVIII.,Ikshumati belonging to the Ikshwākus for generations. Beholding here
12105,SECTION LXVIII.,"Brāhmanas versed in the Vedas drinking water with their joined hands,"
12106,SECTION LXVIII.,they went through Vāhllika towards the mount Sudāmān. There seeing the
12107,SECTION LXVIII.,"foot-print of Vishnu, they, desirous of doing the bidding of their"
12108,SECTION LXVIII.,"master, proceeded a long way, viewing the Vipāçā and the Sālmali and"

12125,SECTION LXIX.,"aggrieved, his sweet speeched associates, endeavouring to chase the"
12126,SECTION LXIX.,"heaviness, began to converse on a variety of subjects. Some played on"
12127,SECTION LXIX.,"instruments; some for the purpose of pacifying his mind, danced (the"
12128,SECTION LXIX.,courtezans); others performed scenes variously fraught with the
12129,SECTION LXIX.,sentiment of mirth. But although his friends intending to allay his
12130,SECTION LXIX.,agitation set about enacting passages calculated to amuse family
12131,SECTION LXIX.,"circles, that magnanimous descendant of Raghu did not indulge in"
12132,SECTION LXIX.,"laughter. Then a dear friend addressed Bharata, as he sat surrounded by"
12133,SECTION LXIX.,"his friends, ""Surrounded by your friends, why do you not, my friend,"
12134,SECTION LXIX.,"join in the mirth?"" Thus asked by his friend, Bharata answered, ""Listen"

12136,SECTION LXIX.,"pale, with his hair loosely flowing about, plunging from the summit of a"

12138,SECTION LXIX.,"on a sink of cow-dung, and yet with a momentary laugh drinking oil by"
12139,SECTION LXIX.,"means of his joined hands. Then feeding on rice mixed with sessame, he"
12140,SECTION LXIX.,"again and again hanging his head down, dives into oil with his limbs"
12141,SECTION LXIX.,"rubbed with oil. And in my dream I saw the ocean dried up, and the moon"
12142,SECTION LXIX.,"fallen on the earth, and the earth as if invaded by enfolding darkness,"
12143,SECTION LXIX.,and the tusk of the elephant on which the monarch rides falling in
12144,SECTION LXIX.,"fragments, and flaming fire suddenly extinguished, and the earth rent,"
12145,SECTION LXIX.,"and the trees withered, and all the mountains befching smoke. . And I"
12146,SECTION LXIX.,"saw the king seated on a sable seat of iron, clad in a sable garb; and"
12147,SECTION LXIX.,women black and yellow beating him. And bearing a garland of red
12148,SECTION LXIX.,"flowers, with his body daubed with red sandal, he was fast proceeding to"
12149,SECTION LXIX.,the south in a car yoked with asses. And women clad in red garment were
12150,SECTION LXIX.,"laughing at him, and a grim-visaged Rākshasa was seen by me as dragging"
12151,SECTION LXIX.,"him. This was the dream that I saw this terrible night. Either I, or"

12155,SECTION LXIX.,"do not respond to your words. Further, my throat is parched, and my mind"
12156,SECTION LXIX.,"ill at ease. Ground of fear find I none, yet am I subject to fear. My"
12157,SECTION LXIX.,"voice is untuned, and my grace fled, and I begin to despise my life, nor"

12184,SECTION LXX.,"setting immense store by her wisdom, my mother Kaikeyi—is it also well"
12185,SECTION LXX.,"with her?"" Thus addressed by the magnanimous Bharata, the envoys spoke"
12186,SECTION LXX.,"unto him these humble and brief words, ""Those of whose welfare you are"
12187,SECTION LXX.,"enquiring after, are, O foremost of men, all well. Sree seated on the"
12188,SECTION LXX.,"lotus asks for you. Let your car be yoked."" Thus addressed, Bharata said"
12189,SECTION LXX.,"unto the envoys, ""Let me tell the king that the envoys are urging speed"
12190,SECTION LXX.,"on me."" Having said this, that son of the king. Bharata, communicated"
12191,SECTION LXX.,"unto his maternal grand-father what the envoys had told him. ""Asked by"
12192,SECTION LXX.,"the envoys, I shall, O monarch, go to my father. I shall come again"
12193,SECTION LXX.,"whenever you will remember me."" Thus accosted by Bharata, his maternal"
12194,SECTION LXX.,"grand-father, the king, smelling Bharata’s head, spoke these auspicious"
12195,SECTION LXX.,"words unto that descendant of Raghu, ""Go, my child; I permit thee."
12196,SECTION LXX.,"Kaikeyi is mother of a worthy son through thee. Do thou, O subduer of"
12197,SECTION LXX.,"foes, communicate our welfare unto both thy father and thy mother. Do"
12198,SECTION LXX.,thou likewise communicate the same unto the priest and the other
12199,SECTION LXX.,"principal Brāhmanas; as also, my child, unto those mighty bowmen, the"
12200,SECTION LXX.,"brothers Rāma and Lakshmana."" Then honoring Bharata, king Kekaya"
12201,SECTION LXX.,conferred on Bharata wealth consisting of choice elephants maintained
12202,SECTION LXX.,(at the palace) and woolen sheets and deerskins. And the king presented
12203,SECTION LXX.,"him with dogs brought up in the inner apartment, resembling tigers in"
12204,SECTION LXX.,"strength and prowess, furnished with teeth representing weapons, and"
12205,SECTION LXX.,"large of body. And honoring the son of Kaikeyi, Kekaya gave him two"
12206,SECTION LXX.,"thousand _nishkas_ and six hundred horses. And for following Bharata,"
12207,SECTION LXX.,"Açwapati without delay assigned a number of goodly, trustworthy, and"
12208,SECTION LXX.,qualified courtiers. And Bharata’s maternal uncle conferred on Bharata
12209,SECTION LXX.,wealth in the shape of graceful elephants sprung in the Irāvat mountain
12210,SECTION LXX.,and the country called Indraçirā; as well as fleet and well-broken
12211,SECTION LXX.,"horses. But owing to the hurry of his departure, Bharata the son of"
12212,SECTION LXX.,Kaikeyi did not appear to be so very much gratified with the gifts.
12213,SECTION LXX.,Owing to his having seen the dream and the post haste speed of the
12214,SECTION LXX.,"envoys, a mighty anxiety was present in his heart. Then issuing from his"
12215,SECTION LXX.,"abode, that one possessed of exceeding grace passed the goodly"
12216,SECTION LXX.,"thoroughfare thronged with men, horses, and elephants. Having left it"
12217,SECTION LXX.,"behind, Bharata saw (before him) the inner apartment (of the king); and"
12218,SECTION LXX.,thereupon the handsome Bharata entered it without let. Then after
12219,SECTION LXX.,"speaking with his maternal grandfather and uncle, Yudhājit, Bharata"
12220,SECTION LXX.,"ascending a car, set out with Satrughna. Thereat servants by means of an"
12221,SECTION LXX.,"hundred cars, furnished with circular wheels, and yoked with camels,"
12222,SECTION LXX.,"oxen, horses, and asses, followed Bharata. Protected by the forces and"
12223,SECTION LXX.,the courtiers of his material grandfather dear unto him like his
12224,SECTION LXX.,"ownself, the magnanimous Bharata who had his foes removed, taking with"
12225,SECTION LXX.,"him his brother, Satrughna, departed from the abode (of the king), like"

12233,SECTION LXXI.,"Issuing from the palace, the blazing Bharata endowed with prowess went"
12234,SECTION LXXI.,"in an easterly direction, and seeing before him the river called Sudāma,"
12235,SECTION LXXI.,crossed it. Then the auspicious descendant of Ikshwāku crossed the broad
12236,SECTION LXXI.,"Hrādini coursing westwards, as also the river Satadru. Then crossing a"
12237,SECTION LXXI.,"river at Eladhāna,¹⁵³ and coming to Aparaparvata,¹⁵⁴ he crossed the"
12238,SECTION LXXI.,"Silā¹⁵⁵ and the Akurvati, and arrived at Agneya¹⁵⁶ and Salyakarshanam."
12239,SECTION LXXI.,"And having purified himself and seen Silāvaha,¹⁵⁷ that one of truthful"
12240,SECTION LXXI.,"purposes passed the Mahāçailas,¹⁵⁸ and entered the forest of"
12241,SECTION LXXI.,Chaitraratha. Then coming upon the confluence of the Gangā. and the
12242,SECTION LXXI.,"Saraswati, Bharata entered the forest of Vārunda lyingto the north¹⁵⁹ of"
12243,SECTION LXXI.,Virāmatsya. Next crossing the rapid river Kulingā and the Hrādini
12244,SECTION LXXI.,"surrounded by hills, as Well as the Yamunā, he ordered the forces to"
12245,SECTION LXXI.,halt. Then cooling the limbs of the fatigued horses (with water) and
12246,SECTION LXXI.,"refreshing them, Bharata himself bathed there and drank of the water;"
12247,SECTION LXXI.,"and then resumed the march, furnished with the water. Then the gentle"
12248,SECTION LXXI.,"prince by means of an excellent car, like unto the wind-god himself,"
12249,SECTION LXXI.,entered the mighty forest inhabited by various races of men. Seeing that
12250,SECTION LXXI.,"the mighty river Gangā was hard to cross at Ancudhāna, Bharata speedily"
12251,SECTION LXXI.,went to the famous city of Prāgvata. And having crossed the Gangā at
12252,SECTION LXXI.,"Prāgvata, he went over to the Kutikoshtikā. Having with his forces"
12253,SECTION LXXI.,"crossed that river, he proceeded to Dharmavarddhana. Then proceeding by"
12254,SECTION LXXI.,"ie south of Torana, he came to Jamvuprastha. Then Daçarātha’s son went"
12255,SECTION LXXI.,to the beautiful village of Varutha. Having for a while stayed at that
12256,SECTION LXXI.,"romantic wood, he proceeded eastwards, and presented himself at the"
12257,SECTION LXXI.,"villa of Ujjihāyana, where abound trees (called) Priyaka. Coming to the"
12258,SECTION LXXI.,"Priyakas, Bharata speedily yoking the horses, set out without delay,"
12259,SECTION LXXI.,issuing his orders to the forces. Then sojourning at Sarvatirtha and
12260,SECTION LXXI.,crossing the river there flowing northwards as well as others abounding
12261,SECTION LXXI.,"in various kinds of mountainous horses, Bharata arrived at"
12262,SECTION LXXI.,Hastiprishthaka. And at Lohitya that foremost of men crossed the
12263,SECTION LXXI.,"Kapivati, at Ekasala, the Sthānumati, and at Vinaya, the Gomati. And"
12264,SECTION LXXI.,"Bharata arriving at a forest of Sala trees in the city of Kalinga,"
12265,SECTION LXXI.,speedily passed it with his forces way-worn. And having passed the
12266,SECTION LXXI.,"forest swiftly over night, he at sunrise saw Ayodhyā built by king Manu."
12267,SECTION LXXI.,"Having spent seven nights on the journey, that chief of men beheld"
12268,SECTION LXXI.,"Ayodhyā before him and thus addressed the charioteer, ""O charioteer,"
12269,SECTION LXXI.,"from the distance Ayodhyā seemeth like a mass of black earth, albeit she"
12270,SECTION LXXI.,"boasts of sacrificial priests crowned with every virtue, Brāhmanas"
12271,SECTION LXXI.,"versed in the Vedas and opulent people, and albeit she is maintained by"
12272,SECTION LXXI.,Rājarshis. Formerly one could hear a great and mighty tumult all round
12273,SECTION LXXI.,Ayodhyā proceeding from men and women; but I do not hear this to-day.
12274,SECTION LXXI.,The gardens wherefrom persons having sported in the evening used to rush
12275,SECTION LXXI.,out (at day break) wear a different aspect now. Forsaken by the
12276,SECTION LXXI.,"pleasure-seekers, the gardens appear to weep. And, O charioteer, the"
12277,SECTION LXXI.,city appears to me like a wilderness. And I do not as formerly behold
12278,SECTION LXXI.,the flower of the city leaving or entering her on cars or elephants or
12279,SECTION LXXI.,"horses. Gardens which, frequented by people inebriated with the honey of"
12280,SECTION LXXI.,"love, met together for purposes of sport, looked charmingly blooming, I"
12281,SECTION LXXI.,"find as utterly void of cheerfulness, with the trees as if lamenting"
12282,SECTION LXXI.,with tremulous leaves. Still do I not hear the inarticulate though sweet
12283,SECTION LXXI.,"and delicious voice of beasts and birds crying in chorus.¹⁶⁰ Why, as"
12284,SECTION LXXI.,"before, doth not the blameless¹⁶¹ and bland wind blow mixed with (the"
12285,SECTION LXXI.,"perfume of sandal and faint with _dhupa_? And why, again, have the"
12286,SECTION LXXI.,"sounds of Vinas and Mridangas developed by beating sticks, which"
12287,SECTION LXXI.,"continually flew in a never-ceasing vigorous course, ceased to-day? And"
12288,SECTION LXXI.,"I witness various evil, unsightly, and unpleasant¹⁶² omens, and hence my"
12289,SECTION LXXI.,"mind is depressed. O charioteer, complete good fortune with my friends"
12290,SECTION LXXI.,is hardly to be realised. Bui although no apparent cause exists for my
12291,SECTION LXXI.,"depression of spirits, yet my heart droopeth."" Then Bharata depressed"
12292,SECTION LXXI.,"and cast down and with his senses afflicted, speedily entered the city"
12293,SECTION LXXI.,"ruled by Ikshwāku. And Bharata having his vehicles fatigued, entered by"
12294,SECTION LXXI.,"the Vaijayanta¹⁶³ gate, and went on, followed by the gate-keepers, who"
12295,SECTION LXXI.,enquired after his welfare. Then courteously telling the warders to
12296,SECTION LXXI.,"desist, he with an agitated heart spoke unto the tired charioteer of"
12297,SECTION LXXI.,"Açwapati, ""0 sinless one, why have I been brought in this haste without"
12298,SECTION LXXI.,any (adequate) reason? My heart apprehendeth some evil; and my
12299,SECTION LXXI.,"disposition gives way. O charioteer, I see around me all those signs"
12300,SECTION LXXI.,which I had heard told as occurring on the occasion of the deaths of
12301,SECTION LXXI.,monarchs. I behold the houses of the citizens unswept and unsightly with
12302,SECTION LXXI.,"the doors flung open,—and destitute of grace, without sacrifices and"
12303,SECTION LXXI.,"other religious ceremonies, without the incense of _dhupa_, the citizens"
12304,SECTION LXXI.,"fasting, and the people appearing with faded countenances, displaying no"
12305,SECTION LXXI.,"flags, etc. The abodes of the deities are not decorated with garlands,"
12306,SECTION LXXI.,"and their courts are unclean; and remaining vacant, they look no longer"
12307,SECTION LXXI.,beautiful as formerly. And the images are not worshipped; and the places
12308,SECTION LXXI.,of sacrifice are in a like condition. And garlands are not displayed in
12309,SECTION LXXI.,"the shops where they are sold. And traders looking anxious, with their"
12310,SECTION LXXI.,"business stopped, do not look as before. And in temples and Chaityas"
12311,SECTION LXXI.,birds and beasts appear dispirited. And in the city I behold men and
12312,SECTION LXXI.,"women pale and woe-begone and emaciated and anxious, with tears filling"
12313,SECTION LXXI.,"their eyes."" Having said this unto the charioteer, Bharata, beholding"
12314,SECTION LXXI.,"these inauspicious sights, entered the palace of the king with a"
12315,SECTION LXXI.,"depressed heart. Beholding the city resembling the city of Indra, with"
12316,SECTION LXXI.,"her crossings and houses and roads void of people, and the doors and"
12317,SECTION LXXI.,"hinges covered with dust, Bharata was filled with greater grief. And"
12318,SECTION LXXI.,witnessing many unpleasant things which he had never seen during the
12319,SECTION LXXI.,"life of the monarch, that high-souled one entered the mansion of his"
12320,SECTION LXXI.,"father, bending his head, depressed in spirits, and with his mind"

12358,SECTION LXXII.,"after his sojourn from home, Kaikeyi delighted, rose up from her golden"
12359,SECTION LXXII.,"seat. On entering his own quarter which he found deprived of grace, the"
12360,SECTION LXXII.,virtuous Bharata took hold of his mother’s auspicious feet. Then
12361,SECTION LXXII.,smelling the crown of his head and embracing him and taking that
12362,SECTION LXXII.,"illustrious one on her lap, Kaikeyi addressed him, saying, ""How many"
12363,SECTION LXXII.,days hence did you leave the residence of the revered one? Hast thou
12364,SECTION LXXII.,felt any fatigue on the way incident to the car proceeding swiftly? And
12365,SECTION LXXII.,"is the revered one well, and thy maternal uncle, Yudhājit? And, my son,"

12367,SECTION LXXII.,"to tell me all this."" Thus asked, that son of the king, Bharata,"
12368,SECTION LXXII.,furnished with eyes resembling lotuses told his mother that all was
12369,SECTION LXXII.,"well. ""Seven nights hence I took leave of that revered one’s residence."
12370,SECTION LXXII.,"My mother’s sire is well, as also my maternal uncle, Yudhājit. My"
12371,SECTION LXXII.,vehicles had got tired in consequence of bearing the wealth and jewels
12372,SECTION LXXII.,"which that subduer of foes, the king, had bestowed on me. And it is for"
12373,SECTION LXXII.,this reason that I have come in advance of them. Urged by the royal
12374,SECTION LXXII.,"emissaries, I have come here so swiftly. But it behoves my mother to"
12375,SECTION LXXII.,tell me what I wish to ask. This sleeping bedstead of yours adorned with
12376,SECTION LXXII.,gold is empty. I do not see the race of Ikshwāku in their usual good

12378,SECTION LXXII.,"coming here with the desire of seeing him, I do not today find him at"

12409,SECTION LXXII.,"Having wept for a long while with his body rolling on the earth,"

12415,SECTION LXXII.,the king breathed his last during my absence? Blessed are Rāma and
12416,SECTION LXXII.,others who have personally performed my sire’s last rites. Surely the
12417,SECTION LXXII.,"renowned monarch doth not know that I have come. (If he had done so),"
12418,SECTION LXXII.,"pressing down my head, my father would at once have smelt it. Where is"

12421,SECTION LXXII.,"arrival unto the vigorous Rāma, who is at once my father, brother and"
12422,SECTION LXXII.,"friend, and whose beloved servant I am. The eldest brother of one that"
12423,SECTION LXXII.,"is noble and cognisant of morality, becomes his father. I shall take"

12426,SECTION LXXII.,"his vow, and having truth for prowess—even my father, say? I wish to"
12427,SECTION LXXII.,"hear news concerning us relative to the last moments of the monarch."""
12428,SECTION LXXII.,"Thus asked, Kaikeyi related all as it had happened, saying, ""Bewailing"
12429,SECTION LXXII.,"’Ah Rāma!’ ’Ah Sitā!’ ’Ah Lakshmana!’ that magnanimous one, the foremost"
12430,SECTION LXXII.,"of those that have attained to excellent state (after death), has gone"
12431,SECTION LXXII.,to the next world coming under the law of time. Thy father like a mighty

12434,SECTION LXXII.,"Lakshmana returned along with Sitā.’"" Hearing this, Bharata apprehending"
12435,SECTION LXXII.,"a second misfortune was deeply moved; and with a sad countenance, he"
12436,SECTION LXXII.,"again asked his mother, ""Where hath gone that righteous* souled one, the"
12437,SECTION LXXII.,"enhancer of Kauçalyā’s joy, along with Lakshmana and Sitā?"" Thus"
12438,SECTION LXXII.,"questioned, his mother at the same time duly said in words. which"
12439,SECTION LXXII.,"although highly unwelcome, she took as agreeable to Bharata, ""O son,"
12440,SECTION LXXII.,"that son of the king wearing bark has repaired to the forest of Dandaka,"
12441,SECTION LXXII.,"along with Vaidehi and followed by Lakshmana."" Hearing this, Bharata"
12442,SECTION LXXII.,apprehending some moral lapse on the part of his brother from the
12443,SECTION LXXII.,"dignity of his race, asked in agitation, ""Has Rāma deprived any Brāhmana"
12444,SECTION LXXII.,"of his wealth? Or has he wronged any innocent person, whether rich or"
12445,SECTION LXXII.,poor? Has the fancy of the prince gone after the wife of another? For
12446,SECTION LXXII.,"what reason hath brother Rāma been banished?"" Thereat his volatile"
12447,SECTION LXXII.,"mother, influenced by her feminine nature, related faithfully unto him"
12448,SECTION LXXII.,"her own doings, Thus asked by the magnanimous Bharata, Kaikeyi vainly"
12449,SECTION LXXII.,"turning herself on her wisdom, joyfully said, ""Rāma has deprived no"
12450,SECTION LXXII.,"Brāhmana of his property, nor hath any innocent person rich or otherwise"
12451,SECTION LXXII.,"been wronged by him,— nor doth he ever with his eyes look at the wife of"
12452,SECTION LXXII.,"another. O son, as soon as I heard of Rāma’s (coming) installation, I"
12453,SECTION LXXII.,"asked for the kingdom to be conferred on thee, and Rāma to be banished."
12454,SECTION LXXII.,"Thereupon, he, staying by his promise, did accordingly: Rāma hath been"
12455,SECTION LXXII.,"banished along with Sumitrā’s son and Sitā.’ Not seeing his beloved son,"
12456,SECTION LXXII.,"the illustrious lord of earth, stricken by grief on his account, has"
12457,SECTION LXXII.,"breathed his last. Do thou now, O thou cognizant of duty, take charge of"
12458,SECTION LXXII.,the kingdom. I have done all this in thy interests. Do not give way to
12459,SECTION LXXII.,"sorrow. O son, assume patience. This city is subject to thee, as well as"
12460,SECTION LXXII.,this peaceful kingdom. Having with the help of the principal Brāhmanas
12461,SECTION LXXII.,"headed by Vasishtha, duly performed the funeral obsequies of the king,"
12462,SECTION LXXII.,"do thou, without suffering thy energy to depart, install thyself in the"

12479,SECTION LXXIII.,"Hearing of his father’s death and the exile of his brothers, Bharata"
12480,SECTION LXXIII.,"burning in grief, said these words, ""Deprived of my father as well as my"
12481,SECTION LXXIII.,"brother like unto a father, what shall I bewailing them and undone by"
12482,SECTION LXXIII.,"thee do with the kingdom? Thou, like one throwing alkali on a sore,"
12483,SECTION LXXIII.,"hast, by bringing about the death of the king and making Rāma an"
12484,SECTION LXXIII.,"ascetic, heaped grief on grief. Thou hast come like the fatal night for"
12485,SECTION LXXIII.,"the destruction of this race. Not understanding it, my father embraced"
12486,SECTION LXXIII.,"live coal. O thou that hast thy gaze fixed on sin, it is through thee"
12487,SECTION LXXIII.,"that my sovereign has come by death; and that, O stainer of the line,"
12488,SECTION LXXIII.,this race has by thy infatuation been deprived of its happiness. Having
12489,SECTION LXXIII.,"got thee, my illustrious sire intent upon truth, king Daçarātha,"
12490,SECTION LXXIII.,"afflicted by extreme sorrow, has departed this life. Why hath the king,"
12491,SECTION LXXIII.,"my father, ever loving virtue, been deprived of life? Why hath Rāma been"
12492,SECTION LXXIII.,banished; and wherefore hath he gone to the woods? Afflicted with grief
12493,SECTION LXXIII.,"for their son, even if Kauçalyā and Sumitrā live, it will be hard for"
12494,SECTION LXXIII.,"them to do so in the presence of thee, my mother. Surely the noble and"
12495,SECTION LXXIII.,"virtuous Rāma, well knowing his duties towards his superiors, regards"
12496,SECTION LXXIII.,"thee as highly as he doth his own mother. In the same way, my eldest"
12497,SECTION LXXIII.,"mother, the far-sighted Kauçalyā, doing her duties by thee, bears"
12498,SECTION LXXIII.,"herself like a sister. Why, O sinful one, having sent to the woods her"
12499,SECTION LXXIII.,"magnanimous son, clad in bark, dost thou not grieve? Having exiled the"
12500,SECTION LXXIII.,"famous and heroic Rāma seeing no sin, clad in bark, what benefit dost"
12501,SECTION LXXIII.,thou perceive as thine? I deem that thou didst not know how very highly
12502,SECTION LXXIII.,I regarded Rāghava; and therefore it is that thou hast brought this
12503,SECTION LXXIII.,"mighty calamity. Not seeing those chiefs of men, Rāma and Lakshmana, by"
12504,SECTION LXXIII.,virtue of whose energy can I venture to rule the kingdom? The monarch
12505,SECTION LXXIII.,"was ever protected by that powerful one possessed of mighty energy, as"
12506,SECTION LXXIII.,Meru is protected by its forest. Like a calf burdened with a load
12507,SECTION LXXIII.,"capable of being borne by a mighty ox, by what energy shall I bear this"
12508,SECTION LXXIII.,burthen which was borne by an exceedingly strong person? And even if
12509,SECTION LXXIII.,"this strength be mine through _yoga_ or vigor of intellect, I will not"
12510,SECTION LXXIII.,"crown with success the hopes of thee, proud of thy son. Nor, had Rāma"
12511,SECTION LXXIII.,"not always regarded thee as his mother, would I hesitate to renounce"
12512,SECTION LXXIII.,"thee, whose heart hath been set on sin. O thou that viewest"
12513,SECTION LXXIII.,"unrighteousness, O thou who hast fallen off from the way of the good,"
12514,SECTION LXXIII.,"how could such thoughts unworthy of our line, arise in thy mind? In this"
12515,SECTION LXXIII.,"race, the eldest brother of all is installed in the kingdom: the other"
12516,SECTION LXXIII.,"brothers remain under him. O fell one, thou dost not, I think, know the"
12517,SECTION LXXIII.,"morality of kings, or the consequence that attends its faithful"
12518,SECTION LXXIII.,"observance. Of all the princes, the eldest is always installed as the"
12519,SECTION LXXIII.,king. Even this is the accepted principle of all sovereigns—specially
12520,SECTION LXXIII.,the descendants of Ikswāku. But to-day the pride of character of those
12521,SECTION LXXIII.,"whose virtue was their sole concern,¹⁶⁵ and who shone in the character"
12522,SECTION LXXIII.,"of their line, has been humbled through thy instrumentality. And how, O"
12523,SECTION LXXIII.,"highly exalted lady, O thou that wast born in a royal race, could such"
12524,SECTION LXXIII.,"reprehensible fatuity take possession of thy senses? But, O thou bent"
12525,SECTION LXXIII.,"upon sin, I will by no means fulfil the wish of thee by whom hath been"
12526,SECTION LXXIII.,brought in the first instance this calamity calculated to end my
12527,SECTION LXXIII.,"existence. Further, O sinless one, I will do this at present to"
12528,SECTION LXXIII.,displease thee: I will bring from the forest my brother dear unto his
12529,SECTION LXXIII.,"relatives. And having brought back Rāma, I will in a perfectly contented"
12530,SECTION LXXIII.,"spirit, become the slave of that one of flaming energy."" The high-souled"
12531,SECTION LXXIII.,Bharata afflicted (his mother) with multitudes of words causing pain;
12532,SECTION LXXIII.,"and distressed with grief, emitted sounds like unto a lion in the cave"
12533,SECTION LXXIII.,of Mandara.

12545,SECTION LXXIV.,"Having been lost to righteousness, do not thou lament me dead. What"
12546,SECTION LXXIV.,qualities of thine were taxed by the king or the exceedingly virtuous
12547,SECTION LXXIV.,"Rāma, that both of them simultaneously have come by death and exile"
12548,SECTION LXXIV.,"respectively through thy agency? O Kaikeyi, thou hast been guilty of"
12549,SECTION LXXIV.,homicide in consequence of the destruction of this race. Do thou go to
12550,SECTION LXXIV.,"hell, never to the world attained by my father; since, renouncing Rāma"
12551,SECTION LXXIV.,"dear unto all, thou hast committed this sin by thy grim act and brought"
12552,SECTION LXXIV.,"me into fear. Through thee hath my father met with his end, and Rāma"
12553,SECTION LXXIV.,hath taken refuge in the woods; and it is through thee that I have come
12554,SECTION LXXIV.,to ignominy among all creatures. O thou enemy of mine in the guise of a
12555,SECTION LXXIV.,mother! O fell one! O thou that covetest the kingdom! do thou not speak
12556,SECTION LXXIV.,"to me, O wicked wretch! O slayer of thy husband! it is because of thee,"
12557,SECTION LXXIV.,"stainer of thy race, that Kauçalyā, Sumitrā, and other mothers of mine"
12558,SECTION LXXIV.,have been overwhelmed with a mighty sorrow. Thou art never the daughter
12559,SECTION LXXIV.,"of the pious and intelligent Açwapati, thou art a Rākshasi born in that"
12560,SECTION LXXIV.,"race, thou that hast destroyed my father’s race, inasmuch as the"
12561,SECTION LXXIV.,virtuous and heroic Rāma ever observing truth hath been sent to the
12562,SECTION LXXIV.,woods and my father hath ascended heaven through thy agency; inasmuch as
12563,SECTION LXXIV.,"thou that hast perpetrated this arch offence, hast laid this sin on me,"
12564,SECTION LXXIV.,"who have been forsaken by my sire, renounced by my brothers, and come by"
12565,SECTION LXXIV.,"universal disfavor. O thou of sinful ways, having separated the virtuous"
12566,SECTION LXXIV.,"Kauçalyā (from her son), what world, O thou that repairest to hell,"
12567,SECTION LXXIV.,"shall be thy portion? Dost thou not, O tortuous one, know that that one"
12568,SECTION LXXIV.,"sprung from Kauçalyā’s, self, my eldest brother Rāma, who is like a"
12569,SECTION LXXIV.,"father unto me, has ever been the refuge of his friends? A son born from"
12570,SECTION LXXIV.,"all the limbs of his mother, comes out from her heart; and therefore it"
12571,SECTION LXXIV.,"is that he is far dearer unto his mother, albeit her friends are dear to"
12572,SECTION LXXIV.,"her.¹⁶⁶ Once on a time, it is related by persons cognizant of morality,"
12573,SECTION LXXIV.,"Surabhi regarded by the celestials, beheld two of her sons toiling on"
12574,SECTION LXXIV.,"earth and seeming to be deprived of their senses. And, when the day had"
12575,SECTION LXXIV.,"been half spent, seeing her sons fatigued on earth, she stricken with"
12576,SECTION LXXIV.,"grief for them, began to weep with tears flooding her eyes. And it came"
12577,SECTION LXXIV.,to pass that as the magnanimous sovereign of the celestials was passing
12578,SECTION LXXIV.,"below, her fine and fragrant tear-drops fell on his person. Turning his"
12579,SECTION LXXIV.,"eyes up, Sakra found Surabhi stationed in the sky, distressed and"
12580,SECTION LXXIV.,weeping in extreme anguish of spirit. Seeing that illustrious one
12581,SECTION LXXIV.,"burning in grief, the wielder of the thunder-bolt, Indra the lord of the"
12582,SECTION LXXIV.,"celestials, waxing anxious, with joined hands said, ’Is there any great"
12583,SECTION LXXIV.,"danger in any quarter? Do thou, O thou that art intent on the welfare of"
12584,SECTION LXXIV.,"all, say, whence is this grief of thine?’ Thus addressed by the"
12585,SECTION LXXIV.,"intelligent king of the celestials, that one well skilled in speech, the"
12586,SECTION LXXIV.,"sedate Surabhi answered, ’Auspiciousness, O lord of celestials! No sin"
12587,SECTION LXXIV.,"is yours. But I mourn my sons fallen into evil plight, having seen them"
12588,SECTION LXXIV.,"lean, distressed, and burnt by the rays of the sun— Valivarddhas"
12589,SECTION LXXIV.,afflicted by the wicked-minded ploughman. Seeing those that have been
12590,SECTION LXXIV.,"born of my body, cast down and in trouble, I grieve: there is none that"
12591,SECTION LXXIV.,is dear like unto a son.’ Seeing her the whole earth is filled with
12592,SECTION LXXIV.,"whose sons by thousands, weeping, Indra understood that none is an"
12593,SECTION LXXIV.,"object of greater affection than a son. And that lord, Indra, also"
12594,SECTION LXXIV.,"considered Surabhi of a person breathing a sacred odour, whose tears had"
12595,SECTION LXXIV.,"dropped on his body, as the foremost being on earth. Even that one"
12596,SECTION LXXIV.,"yeilding whatever is asked, auspicious, crowned with the choicest"
12597,SECTION LXXIV.,"virtues, although having all natural functions, showing equal kindness"
12598,SECTION LXXIV.,"unto all, and of unequalled character, who maintaineth all creatures,"
12599,SECTION LXXIV.,"she who hath a thousand sons, grieves (for her sons). How can then"
12600,SECTION LXXIV.,"Kauçalyā carry on existence without Rāma? Chaste and having an only son,"
12601,SECTION LXXIV.,"that lady has through thee been separated from her son, (like a cow"
12602,SECTION LXXIV.,"separated from her calf). For this, thou wilt always have to suffer"
12603,SECTION LXXIV.,misery alike in this world and the next I shall for my part completely
12604,SECTION LXXIV.,"minister unto my brother and father; and shall, without doubt, increase"
12605,SECTION LXXIV.,my fame. Bringing hither the mighty-armed lord of Koçala endowed with
12606,SECTION LXXIV.,"immense strength, I myself will repair to the forest inhabited by"
12607,SECTION LXXIV.,"ascetics. O thou that hast delivered thyself over to iniquity! I, looked"
12608,SECTION LXXIV.,at by the citizens with their throats oppressed with the vapour of
12609,SECTION LXXIV.,"grief, cannot bear this (burden of) sin heaped on me by thee. Do thou"
12610,SECTION LXXIV.,"enter fire, or dive into Dandaka, or wound a cord round thy neck: other"
12611,SECTION LXXIV.,"desirable way there is none for thee. On Rāma having truth for prowess,"
12612,SECTION LXXIV.,"obtaining the earth, I, my disgrace removed, shall be blest."" Grieving"
12613,SECTION LXXIV.,"thus, Bharata, like an elephant in the forest afflicted with a _tomara_"
12614,SECTION LXXIV.,"or _ankusa_,¹⁶⁷ fell to the earth sighing like an enraged snake. With"

12616,SECTION LXXIV.,"away, that subduer of foes, the king’s son fallen on the earth,"

12633,SECTION LXXV.,"filled with tears, began to tax her in the midst of the courtiers: ""I"
12634,SECTION LXXV.,had never desired the kingdom. I had never consulted my mother. Nor did
12635,SECTION LXXV.,I know the installation that had been thought of by the monarch. I was
12636,SECTION LXXV.,then living in a far country in company with Satrughna. I did not know
12637,SECTION LXXV.,"the banishment of the magnanimous Rāma to the woods, or the exile of"
12638,SECTION LXXV.,"Sumitrā’s son; nor did I know how Sitā came to be banished."" As the"
12639,SECTION LXXV.,"high-souled Bharata was thus wailing, Kauçalyā recognizing his voice"
12640,SECTION LXXV.,"spoke unto Sumitrā, ""Come is Bharata, the son of that one of crooked"
12641,SECTION LXXV.,"ways. I am desirous of seeing the far-sighted Bharata."" Having said this"
12642,SECTION LXXV.,"unto Sumitrā, that one emaciated and with a pallid countenance,"
12643,SECTION LXXV.,"trembling and almost deprived of sensation, went to where Bharata was."
12644,SECTION LXXV.,"And it came to pass that the king’s son, Bharata, along with Satrughna"
12645,SECTION LXXV.,"had just then by the way that led to the same, been proceeding to"
12646,SECTION LXXV.,Kauçalyā’s quarter. Then Satrughna and Bharata seeing the aggrieved
12647,SECTION LXXV.,"Kauçalyā, embraced the stricken and fallen lady well nigh deprived of"
12648,SECTION LXXV.,"her senses. Thereupon, weeping from grief, the noble and intelligent"
12649,SECTION LXXV.,"Kauçalyā exceedingly afflicted, embracing them as they indulged in"
12650,SECTION LXXV.,"sorrow, said unto Bharata, ""Thus hast thou, that hadst desired the"
12651,SECTION LXXV.,"kingdom, received it rid of its thorn. Alas! it has been speedily"
12652,SECTION LXXV.,obtained through the crooked act of Kaikeyi. What is the good that is
12653,SECTION LXXV.,perceived by Kaikeyi of tortuous sight in sending away my son clad in
12654,SECTION LXXV.,bark to the woods? It behoveth Kaikeyi to send me also speedily to where
12655,SECTION LXXV.,is staying my illustrious son furnished with a gold-gleaming navel. Or
12656,SECTION LXXV.,"first performing the fire-sacrifice, I followed by Sumitrā, will myself"
12657,SECTION LXXV.,happily seek the way by which Rāghava (has gone to the woods). Or it
12658,SECTION LXXV.,behoveth thee to thyself bring me unto the place where that foremost of
12659,SECTION LXXV.,"men, my son, is performing austerities. This spacious kingdom abounding"
12660,SECTION LXXV.,"in corn and wealth, and filled with elephants, horses, and cars, is"
12661,SECTION LXXV.,"thine, having been conferred on thee (by Kaikeyi)."" Thus reproached by"
12662,SECTION LXXV.,"many a harsh word, the sinless Bharata felt exceeding pain like unto"
12663,SECTION LXXV.,"that produced by pricking a sore with a needle. Exceedingly agitated, he"
12664,SECTION LXXV.,"fell at Kauçalyā’s feet, lamenting much, and well nigh deprived of his"
12665,SECTION LXXV.,"senses. Bharata then regained his consciousness, and with joined hands"
12666,SECTION LXXV.,"answered Kauçalyā lamenting thus and overcome with excess of sorrow,"
12667,SECTION LXXV.,"saying,—""O noble lady, what for dost thou censure me who am without sin"
12668,SECTION LXXV.,and who know nothing of this? Thou knowest that profuse is my delight in
12669,SECTION LXXV.,"Rāghava. May the sense of him never follow scripture, that had approved"

12764,SECTION LXXV.,"swervest not from virtue. My child, for this reason thou wilt attain the"
12765,SECTION LXXV.,"regions of pious persons. Saying this, Kauçalyā overpowered with"
12766,SECTION LXXV.,"emotion, drawing into her lap Bharata attached to his brother, and"
12767,SECTION LXXV.,"embracing the mighty armed one, gave way to grief. And bewailing thus,"
12768,SECTION LXXV.,"the mind of the high souled (Bharata) wrought with sorrow, was overcome"
12769,SECTION LXXV.,"with the burden of grief. And fallen on the ground, lamenting,"
12770,SECTION LXXV.,"senseless, with his intellect overpowered, and momentarily heaving"
12771,SECTION LXXV.,"sighs, Bharata passed away night in grief."
12772,SECTION LXXV.,
12773,SECTION LXXV.,
12774,SECTION LXXV.,
12775,SECTION LXXVI.,SECTION LXXVI.
12776,SECTION LXXVI.,
12777,SECTION LXXVI.,
12778,SECTION LXXVI.,"As Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi was thus burning in grief, that foremost"
12779,SECTION LXXVI.,"of those skilled in speech, the saint Vasishtha, endowed with excellence"
12780,SECTION LXXVI.,"of language, said, ""Do not weep, good betide thee, O illustrious prince."
12781,SECTION LXXVI.,"Do thou perform the funereal rites of the departed king."" Hearing"
12782,SECTION LXXVI.,"Vasishtha’s words, Bharata cognisant of duty, bowed down to the ground"
12783,SECTION LXXVI.,and despatched the ministers for performing the last rites. And raising
12784,SECTION LXXVI.,"from under the oil the body of the king with a sallow countenance, and"
12785,SECTION LXXVI.,"appearing to be asleep, Bharata placed it on the ground upon a couch in"
12786,SECTION LXXVI.,"front adorned with various gems. Then overwhelmed with grief,"
12787,SECTION LXXVI.,"Daçarātha’s son bewailed him thus, ""O king, what was it that thou hadst"
12788,SECTION LXXVI.,"intended to do, I absent and away from home, by banishing righteous Rāma"
12789,SECTION LXXVI.,"and the powerful Lakshmana? Whither wendest thou, O mighty monarch,"
12790,SECTION LXXVI.,"forsaking these aggrieved people, who have already been deprived of the"
12791,SECTION LXXVI.,"lion like Rāma energetic in action? O father, thou having ascended"
12792,SECTION LXXVI.,"heaven and Rāma having taken refuge in the woods, who now in this city"
12793,SECTION LXXVI.,of thine shall protect what the people possess and secure unto them what
12794,SECTION LXXVI.,"they have not? Widowed in consequence of losing thee, this earth does"
12795,SECTION LXXVI.,not look graceful. The city appeareth unto me like the night deprived of
12796,SECTION LXXVI.,"the Moon."" As Bharata was lamenting thus in dejected mood, the mighty"
12797,SECTION LXXVI.,"ascetic Vasishtha again addressed him, saying, ""O mighty armed one, do"
12798,SECTION LXXVI.,"thou without indulging in any reflections, perform those funeral"
12799,SECTION LXXVI.,"ceremonies of the monarch which ought to be performed."" Thereupon"
12800,SECTION LXXVI.,"honoring his words by saying, ""So be it,"" he urged speed upon all the"
12801,SECTION LXXVI.,"Ritwigas, priests, and Achāryas. And then those that had brought the"
12802,SECTION LXXVI.,"king’s corpse outside from the fire chamber, instructed by the Ritwigas"
12803,SECTION LXXVI.,and priests according to the ordinance began to offer oblations into the
12804,SECTION LXXVI.,"fire. Next placing the king deprived of life on a car, the servants with"
12805,SECTION LXXVI.,their throats oppressed with vapour and with their minds weighed down
12806,SECTION LXXVI.,with dejection carried him. And scattering gold and silver and various
12807,SECTION LXXVI.,"kinds of cloth, on the way, people went in front of the king. Others"
12808,SECTION LXXVI.,"procuring sandal, _aguru_ and other resinous incenses, _sarala_,"
12809,SECTION LXXVI.,"_padmaka_ and _devaduru_, cast it (on the earth). And drawing near the"
12810,SECTION LXXVI.,"king there, Ritwigas laid various other fragrant substances on the"
12811,SECTION LXXVI.,"funeral pile. Then offering oblations into the fire, the Ritwigas began"
12812,SECTION LXXVI.,"to recite _japa_; and as laid down in the scriptures, Sāma singers"
12813,SECTION LXXVI.,"chanted Sāmas. And by means of litters and other conveyances, each"
12814,SECTION LXXVI.,"mounted according to her rank, the wives of the king went out from the"
12815,SECTION LXXVI.,"city, surrounded by aged men. And Ritwijas went round the corpse of the"
12816,SECTION LXXVI.,king who performed many sacrifices leaving it on the left side. And
12817,SECTION LXXVI.,"kindling with grief, the females also headed by Kauçalyā,"
12818,SECTION LXXVI.,(circumambulated the pyre). And then there was heard the wail of women
12819,SECTION LXXVI.,distressed with grief weeping piteously by thousands like unto
12820,SECTION LXXVI.,"Kraunchis. Weeping again and again with their sense lost, the wives of"
12821,SECTION LXXVI.,the king alighted from the car on the banks of the Sarayu. Having
12822,SECTION LXXVI.,"performed the watery rites, the wives of the monarch as well as the"
12823,SECTION LXXVI.,"counsellors and priests, in company with Bharata entering the city with"
12824,SECTION LXXVI.,"tears in their eyes, spent ten days¹⁶⁸ in mourning lying down on the"
12825,SECTION LXXVI.,ground.
12826,SECTION LXXVI.,
12827,SECTION LXXVI.,"¹⁶⁸ The _Smriti_ lays down twelve days of mourning for kings, and"
12828,SECTION LXXVI.,"sixteen for Ksbatriyas. Parasara, however, fixes _ten days_ for"
12829,SECTION LXXVI.,Kshatriyas in general.—T.

12836,SECTION LXXVII.,"When the ten days had gone by, the king’s son, his uncleanness"
12837,SECTION LXXVII.,"(consequent on the demise of his father) removed, performed the"
12838,SECTION LXXVII.,_srāddha_ on the twelfth day. On the occasion of the ceremonies for the
12839,SECTION LXXVII.,"welfare of the departed spirit, the son of the king conferred on"
12840,SECTION LXXVII.,"Brāhmanas wealth and gems, and rice in abudance, and herds of goats, and"
12841,SECTION LXXVII.,"silver in profusion, and countless kine, and maid-servants and"
12842,SECTION LXXVII.,"man-servants, and vehicles and spacious mansions. And on the thirteenth"
12843,SECTION LXXVII.,"day, the long armed Bharata, overwhelmed with grief, burst into"
12844,SECTION LXXVII.,lamentation. And coming to the foot of the funeral pyre for gathering
12845,SECTION LXXVII.,"the bones of the departed, he overcome with grief, with his throat"
12846,SECTION LXXVII.,"obstructed with the sounds of lamentation, said, ""my father, on brother"
12847,SECTION LXXVII.,"Rāma, to whom I had been consigned by thee, having gone to the forest, I"
12848,SECTION LXXVII.,"have been cast by thee into vacancy. My father, forsaking forlorn mother"
12849,SECTION LXXVII.,"Kauçalyā, whose stay her son, had gone to the forest, where hast thou"
12850,SECTION LXXVII.,"gone, O king?"" And seeing the spot where lay the bones of his father"
12851,SECTION LXXVII.,"mixed with ashes and embers, Bharata looking at the place where occurred"
12852,SECTION LXXVII.,"the dissolution of his father’s frame, carried away by emotion, indulged"
12853,SECTION LXXVII.,"in sorrow. And seeing this, he exceedingly distressed, crying fell down"
12854,SECTION LXXVII.,to the ground. And raised up (by others) he looked like an uplifted
12855,SECTION LXXVII.,banner of _Sakra_ bound to an engine. And his counsellors rushed towards
12856,SECTION LXXVII.,"that one of pure vows, like the saints making towards Jayati as he was"
12857,SECTION LXXVII.,"falling on the extinction of his merit. Seeing Bharata plunged in grief,"
12858,SECTION LXXVII.,"Satrughna remembering the king, fell down to the ground deprived of"
12859,SECTION LXXVII.,"consciousness. And devoid of sense and like a madman, he in grief of"
12860,SECTION LXXVII.,heart began to lament remembering all the virtues of his father again
12861,SECTION LXXVII.,"and again. ""This terrible sea of grief owing its origin to Mantharā,"
12862,SECTION LXXVII.,"containing its ferocious aquatic animal in the shape of Kaikeyi, and"
12863,SECTION LXXVII.,incapable of being disturbed in consequence of the bestowal of the boon
12864,SECTION LXXVII.,"drowns (us). O father, where hast thou gone, leaving the tender and"
12865,SECTION LXXVII.,"youthful Bharata fondled by thee, to lament (thy loss). Thou didst use"
12866,SECTION LXXVII.,to confer on us eatables and drinkables and attires and ornaments. Who
12867,SECTION LXXVII.,"will now do so? Deprived of thee, the high souled king cognisant of"
12868,SECTION LXXVII.,"duty, the earth albeit her time of riving is come, is not yet riven. My"
12869,SECTION LXXVII.,"father having gone to heaven and Rāma having sought the woods, how can I"
12870,SECTION LXXVII.,"live? I will enter fire. Bereft of my brother and sire, I will not enter"
12871,SECTION LXXVII.,the empty Ayodhyā governed by the Ikshwākus. I will repair to the forest
12872,SECTION LXXVII.,"of asceticism."" Hearing his lamentations and seeing that disaster, all"
12873,SECTION LXXVII.,the followers became all the more distressed. Then depressed and
12874,SECTION LXXVII.,"exhausted, both Satrughna and Bharata rolled on the earth like two bulls"
12875,SECTION LXXVII.,with their horns fractured. Then the all-knowing priest of their father
12876,SECTION LXXVII.,"possessed of sterling worth, Vasishtha, raising Bharata, said unto him,"
12877,SECTION LXXVII.,"""O Lord this is the thirteenth day since the cremation of thy sire. Why"
12878,SECTION LXXVII.,"dost thou delay, when thou hast to collect the bones? Three couples¹⁶⁹"
12879,SECTION LXXVII.,"pertain in especial to all creatures and these being inevitable, thou"
12880,SECTION LXXVII.,ought not to bear yourself thus. And Sumantra also versed in the nature
12881,SECTION LXXVII.,"of things, raising up Satrughna and pacifying him, discoursed the birth"
12882,SECTION LXXVII.,"and death of all beings. Being raised up, those renowned chiefs of men"
12883,SECTION LXXVII.,looked like Indra’s banner stained by shine and shower. And as the
12884,SECTION LXXVII.,"princes stood there shedding tears, with reddened eyes, and speaking"
12885,SECTION LXXVII.,"sadly, the courtiers urged them on in behalf of the rites that remained."
12886,SECTION LXXVII.,
12887,SECTION LXXVII.,"¹⁶⁹ Hunger and thirst, ignorance and grief, sickness and death."
12888,SECTION LXXVII.,

12891,SECTION LXXVIII.,SECTION LXXVIII.
12892,SECTION LXXVIII.,
12893,SECTION LXXVIII.,
12894,SECTION LXXVIII.,"Then Satrughna, the younger brother of Lakshmana spoke unto Bharata"
12895,SECTION LXXVIII.,burning in grief as he was revolving in his mind the (intended) journey
12896,SECTION LXXVIII.,"(to Rāma), ""Need it be said that Rāma is the refuge both of himself and"
12897,SECTION LXXVIII.,all creatures in trouble? That Rāma possessed of strength hath been
12898,SECTION LXXVIII.,"exiled into the woods by a woman! And powerful and having prowess, why"
12899,SECTION LXXVIII.,did not Lakshmana deliver Rāma by checking our father? The king bent
12900,SECTION LXXVIII.,"upon following an unrighteous course through the influence of a woman,"
12901,SECTION LXXVIII.,"should, the justice or otherwise of the measure being fully weighed, at"
12902,SECTION LXXVIII.,"the very outset have been checked."" As Lakshmana’s younger brother"
12903,SECTION LXXVIII.,"Satrughna was speaking thus, appeared there at the door in front the"
12904,SECTION LXXVIII.,"hump-backed one adorned with every kind of ornament, with her body"
12905,SECTION LXXVIII.,"besmeared with sandal paste, wearing regal apparel, and variously decked"
12906,SECTION LXXVIII.,"out with a variety of ornaments. And adorned with elegant cones, and"
12907,SECTION LXXVIII.,"divers other superb ornaments, she looked like a female monkey tethered"
12908,SECTION LXXVIII.,"with a rope. At that time seeing that one of horrible misdeeds,"
12909,SECTION LXXVIII.,"(Bharata) who stood near the door, seizing the hump backed one"
12910,SECTION LXXVIII.,"ruthlessly, took her unto Satrughna, and said, ""That one through whom"
12911,SECTION LXXVIII.,Rāma has gone to the wood and our father has renounced his body this is
12912,SECTION LXXVIII.,"that wicked and remorseless one. Do thou deal with her as thou likest."""
12913,SECTION LXXVIII.,At Bharata’s command Satrughna observing vows waxing exceedingly
12914,SECTION LXXVIII.,"aggrieved, addressed all the inmates of the inner apartment, saying,"
12915,SECTION LXXVIII.,"""This one has occasioned intense misery unto my father and brothers. Let"
12916,SECTION LXXVIII.,"her now take the fruit of her fell deed."" Having said this, he furiously"
12917,SECTION LXXVIII.,fell upon the hump backed one surrounded by her maids. Thereupon she
12918,SECTION LXXVIII.,with her cries made the chamber resound. Concluding Satrughna fired with
12919,SECTION LXXVIII.,"rage, her associates extremely pained, fled away in all directions. Then"
12920,SECTION LXXVIII.,"her companions in a body took counsel of each other, saying,"
12921,SECTION LXXVIII.,"""considering the way in which he has entered upon it, he will annihilate"
12922,SECTION LXXVIII.,us quite. Let us therefore seek the protection of the tender hearted
12923,SECTION LXXVIII.,"generous, pious and illustrious Kauçalyā. Even she is our sure refuge."
12924,SECTION LXXVIII.,"Overpowered with rage, that chastiser of foes, Satrughna, dragged the"
12925,SECTION LXXVIII.,shrieking hump-backed one to the ground. As Mantharā was pushed this way
12926,SECTION LXXVIII.,"and that, her various ornaments were scattered over the floor. Aad"
12927,SECTION LXXVIII.,"strewn with those ornaments, the graceful chamber of the palace looked"
12928,SECTION LXXVIII.,like the autumnal firmament. And that foremost of men possessed of
12929,SECTION LXXVIII.,"strength holding her, began to reprove Kaikeyi with harsh speech."
12930,SECTION LXXVIII.,"Extremely hurt by those rough words, Kaikeyi terrified on account of"
12931,SECTION LXXVIII.,"Satrughna, took refuge with her son. Thereupon casting his eyes on"
12932,SECTION LXXVIII.,"Satrughna, Bharata said, ""A woman is incapable of being slain by any. Do"
12933,SECTION LXXVIII.,thou therefore excuse her. I myself would have slain this wicked Kaikeyi
12934,SECTION LXXVIII.,"of impious deeds, if the righteous Rāma should not be displeased with me"
12935,SECTION LXXVIII.,on account of my slaying my mother. And if Rāghava knows that the
12936,SECTION LXXVIII.,"hump-backed one hath been slain, he surely will speak neither with thee"
12937,SECTION LXXVIII.,"nor me."" Hearing Bharata’s words, Satrughna, younger brother unto"
12938,SECTION LXXVIII.,"Lakshmana, refrained from that wrong and set free the hump-backed woman"
12939,SECTION LXXVIII.,"in a swoon. Thereat, sighing hard in exceeding grief, Mantharā flung"
12940,SECTION LXXVIII.,"herself at Kaikeyi’s feet, weeping piteously. Seeing the hump-backed one"
12941,SECTION LXXVIII.,deprived of her senses in consequence of the pushing she had received at
12942,SECTION LXXVIII.,"the hands of Satrughna, Bhjarata’s mother consoled that distressed"
12943,SECTION LXXVIII.,"woman, who appeared like a Kraunchi that had been entrapped."
12944,SECTION LXXVIII.,

12947,SECTION LXXIX.,SECTION LXXIX.
12948,SECTION LXXIX.,
12949,SECTION LXXIX.,
12950,SECTION LXXIX.,"Then on the morning of the fourteenth day, the ministers of the king"
12951,SECTION LXXIX.,"assembled addressed Bharata in the following words, ""Having exiled his"
12952,SECTION LXXIX.,"eldest son and the exceedingly strong Lakshmana, Daçarātha who was the"
12953,SECTION LXXIX.,"superior of our superiors hath gone to heaven. Do thou, therefore, O"
12954,SECTION LXXIX.,"illustrious prince, become our king. Having been permitted by the king,"
12955,SECTION LXXIX.,"thou wilt commit no fault (by doing so), as this kingdom is without a"
12956,SECTION LXXIX.,"master. O Rāghava, having procured all these necessaries for the"
12957,SECTION LXXIX.,"installation, the counsellors and others as well as the citizens wait, O"
12958,SECTION LXXIX.,"king’s son. Do thou, O Bharata, take charge of this secure kingdom"
12959,SECTION LXXIX.,"bequeathed by thy father and grandfather. Do thou, O foremost of men,"
12960,SECTION LXXIX.,"have thyself sprinkled, and rule over us."" Thereupon, having gone round"
12961,SECTION LXXIX.,all the things procured for the sprinkling Bharata firm in his vows
12962,SECTION LXXIX.,"addressed those persons, saying, ""In our line it is ever fit for the"
12963,SECTION LXXIX.,first-born alone to perform the task of government. It doth not behove
12964,SECTION LXXIX.,ye who are wise to say so unto me. Certainly Rāma our eldest brother
12965,SECTION LXXIX.,shall become the king; and I will abide in the forest for five and nine
12966,SECTION LXXIX.,years. Do ye array the grand and mighty army consisting of fourfold
12967,SECTION LXXIX.,forces. I will bring back from the forest my eldest brother Rāghava. And
12968,SECTION LXXIX.,"taking all these necessaries for the investiture in front, I will go in"
12969,SECTION LXXIX.,the direction of the forest for Rāma. And sprinkling that chief of men
12970,SECTION LXXIX.,"on the spot, I will placing him in our front, bring Rāma back, like unto"
12971,SECTION LXXIX.,fire brought in from the sacrifice. I will never fulfil the desire of
12972,SECTION LXXIX.,"this lady proud of her son. I will inhabit the impracticable woods, and"
12973,SECTION LXXIX.,Rāma shall become the monarch. Let workmen lay out level roads in uneven
12974,SECTION LXXIX.,tracts; and let those men that are adepts in threading places difficult
12975,SECTION LXXIX.,"to pass through, follow us."" When the prince had spoken thus in behalf"
12976,SECTION LXXIX.,"of Rāma, all those persons answered him in these excellent words, ""For"
12977,SECTION LXXIX.,"saying this, may Lakshmi seated on the lotus remain at thy side;"
12978,SECTION LXXIX.,inasmuch as thou wishest to confer the earth on the eldest son of the
12979,SECTION LXXIX.,"monarch!"" Hearing that graceful speech of the king’s son, tear-drops,"
12980,SECTION LXXIX.,begot of delight began to trickle from their eyes and adorned those
12981,SECTION LXXIX.,"noble countenances. And their grief removed, with cheerful hearts, the"
12982,SECTION LXXIX.,"counsellors, courtiers, and others hearing that speech (of the prince),"
12983,SECTION LXXIX.,"said, ""O best of men, according to thy order, artizans as well as people"
12984,SECTION LXXIX.,"cherishing a high regard for thee have been directed to lay out a road."""

12988,SECTION LXXX.,SECTION LXXX.
12989,SECTION LXXX.,

12994,SECTION LXXX.,"water courses, people on pay, car-makers, men preparing machines,"
12995,SECTION LXXX.,"carpenters, those intended to guard the ways, pioneers, cooks,"
12996,SECTION LXXX.,"perfumers, makers of wicker-ware and able guides. And as the mighty"
12997,SECTION LXXX.,"throng began to proceed, it resembled the swell of the sea on the"
12998,SECTION LXXX.,occasion of a _parva_. And numbers of men skilled in road-constructing
12999,SECTION LXXX.,"went before furnished with various implements. And hewing away boughs,"
13000,SECTION LXXX.,"and plants and shrubs and woody projections, stones, and diverse trees,"
13001,SECTION LXXX.,they went on preparing a road. And they set up trees where there were
13002,SECTION LXXX.,"none, and at places they felled trees by means of axes, _tankas_, and"
13003,SECTION LXXX.,"_daos_, others possessed of greater strength and more powerful, with"
13004,SECTION LXXX.,their hands uprooted masses of Virana and here and there leveled a
13005,SECTION LXXX.,rising ground. And others filled up with dust wells and capacious
13006,SECTION LXXX.,"hollows, and speedily leveled deep places air around. And those men"
13007,SECTION LXXX.,"threw bridges wherever they became necessary, and broke the earth"
13008,SECTION LXXX.,"wherever such a process was required, and excavated whenever it was"
13009,SECTION LXXX.,"necessary. In a short time, they made places poor of water overflow with"
13010,SECTION LXXX.,many and various expanses resembling the ocean. And in tracts void of
13011,SECTION LXXX.,"water, they digged divers receptacles of water, decorated with daises."
13012,SECTION LXXX.,"And the way of the army, furnished with pavements of bricks and clay,"
13013,SECTION LXXX.,"with trees bearing blosoms, eloquent with the tunes of birds, decorated"
13014,SECTION LXXX.,"with pennons, sprinkled with sandal showers, and garnished with flowers"
13015,SECTION LXXX.,"of various kinds, looked exceedingly beautiful, like unto the way of the"
13016,SECTION LXXX.,"celestials. Then having received the command of Bharata, the men that"
13017,SECTION LXXX.,"were in charge of the tents, ordered (the workmen) to pitch the tents,"
13018,SECTION LXXX.,and when they had been pitched at a romantic spot filled with tasteful
13019,SECTION LXXX.,"fruits, in consonance with the injunction of the high-souled Bharata,"
13020,SECTION LXXX.,the men decorated splendidly the tents which themselves were like the
13021,SECTION LXXX.,ornaments of the road. And under an auspicious statf and at a favorable
13022,SECTION LXXX.,"hour, men well up in the work set the encampment of the high-souled"
13023,SECTION LXXX.,"Bharata. And the tenfs surrounded by an entrenchment paved with dust,"
13024,SECTION LXXX.,"containing images made of sapphires, graced with goodly thoroughfares,"
13025,SECTION LXXX.,"lined with edifices, encircled by towers and walls, decorated with"
13026,SECTION LXXX.,"streamers, having well-made high-ways, and appearing like celestial"
13027,SECTION LXXX.,"daises and containing stately mansions with dove-cotes, resembled the"
13028,SECTION LXXX.,metropolis of Sakra himself. And passing by the Jahnavi abounding in
13029,SECTION LXXX.,"various trees and woods, of cool and crystal waters, and filled with"
13030,SECTION LXXX.,"mighty fishes, that way of the chief of men constructed by artizans,"
13031,SECTION LXXX.,"looked more and more lovely as it proceeded, as the unclouded sky looks"
13032,SECTION LXXX.,"beautiful at night, adorned with inumerable stars."

13039,SECTION LXXXI.,Then seeing that the night in which had been performed the auspicious
13040,SECTION LXXXI.,"preliminary ceremonies, was about to be spent, eulogists and"
13041,SECTION LXXXI.,genealogists hymned Bharata with consecrated hymns. And then sounded the
13042,SECTION LXXXI.,"kettle-drum, beaten by a golden stick, announcing the departure of the"
13043,SECTION LXXXI.,night; and people sounded conchs and other instruments by hundreds
13044,SECTION LXXXI.,"furnished with soft and loud sounds. And as if fillihg the heavens,"
13045,SECTION LXXXI.,those powerful blasts of the trumpet repeatedly rendered Bharata burning
13046,SECTION LXXXI.,in grief the more aggrieved. Then awaking and silencing those sounds
13047,SECTION LXXXI.,"with saying—""I am not the king,"" he said unto Satrughna, ""Behold, O"
13048,SECTION LXXXI.,"Satrughna, in what a mighty wrong the people are engaged, on account of"
13049,SECTION LXXXI.,Kaikeyi. The king Daçarātha has gone away throwing down on me (the
13050,SECTION LXXXI.,burden of) this misery. The royal grace founded in righteousness of that
13051,SECTION LXXXI.,magnanimous and virtuous monarch is wandering even like a boat on water
13052,SECTION LXXXI.,having no helmsman. And he who is our mighty master hath been banished
13053,SECTION LXXXI.,into the woods by this mother of mine! who had (in doing so) renounced
13054,SECTION LXXXI.,"virtue."" Seeing Bharata lamenting thus senseless, the ladies afflicted"
13055,SECTION LXXXI.,with sorrow began to wail in winsome accents. As Bharata Was mourning
13056,SECTION LXXXI.,"thus, the highly famous and virtuous Vasishtha accompanied by his"
13057,SECTION LXXXI.,"disciples entered the court of the Ikshwāku king: built of entire gold,"
13058,SECTION LXXXI.,"charming, dazzling with gems and gold: like unto Sudharmā itself."
13059,SECTION LXXXI.,"Sitting down on a golden seat furnished with an elegant cover, that one"
13060,SECTION LXXXI.,"versed in all the Vedas commanded the envoys, saying,—""Do ye speedily"
13061,SECTION LXXXI.,with collected minds bring hither Brāhmanas and Kshatriyas and warriors
13062,SECTION LXXXI.,and counsellors and generals of forces and Satrughna with the other
13063,SECTION LXXXI.,"princes, and the famous Bharata and Yudhājit¹⁷⁰ and Sumantra and others"
13064,SECTION LXXXI.,"that are engaged in our welfare."" Then there arose a mighty hubbub"
13065,SECTION LXXXI.,"occasioned by people coming up in cars, horses and elephants. And when"
13066,SECTION LXXXI.,"Bharata arrived, the subjects rejoiced as they used to rejoice on"
13067,SECTION LXXXI.,Daçarātha’s arrival; and as rejoiced the immortals on the arrival of him
13068,SECTION LXXXI.,of an hundred sacrifices. And then the court resembling a moveless ocean
13069,SECTION LXXXI.,"containing whales and serpents,¹⁷¹ and gems and conchs and gold-mines,"
13070,SECTION LXXXI.,"being graced with the presence of Daçarātha’s son, looked splendid as it"
13071,SECTION LXXXI.,formerly did with that of Daçarātha himself.

13082,SECTION LXXXII.,And then the intelligent Bharata surveyed that assembly filled with
13083,SECTION LXXXII.,"noble, and worthy personages, resembling the night of the full moon. And"
13084,SECTION LXXXII.,that august assembly was ablaze with the brilliant hues proceeding from
13085,SECTION LXXXII.,the attires of the honorable persons seated according to rank. And that
13086,SECTION LXXXII.,splendid assembly filled with learned people looked like the night of
13087,SECTION LXXXII.,the full moon after the clouds have dispersed. And seeing all the
13088,SECTION LXXXII.,subjects of the sovereign gathered together the priest cognizant of
13089,SECTION LXXXII.,"virtue soflty spoke unto Bharata, ""My child, leaving unto thee this"
13090,SECTION LXXXII.,"prosperous earth abounding in corn and wealth, king Daçarātha having"
13091,SECTION LXXXII.,"performed his duties, hath gone to heaven. And Rāma of truthful"
13092,SECTION LXXXII.,character observing the virtue of the righteous hath not set aside his
13093,SECTION LXXXII.,"father’s commands, even as the risen moon doth not renounce the"
13094,SECTION LXXXII.,"moonlight. Loved by the courtiers, do thou, having been installed, enjoy"
13095,SECTION LXXXII.,"this kingdom conferred on thee by thy father and mother, rid of its"
13096,SECTION LXXXII.,"thorn. Let princes throned as well as those without thrones, from east,"
13097,SECTION LXXXII.,"and west, north and south, and also persons ranging the sea, procure"
13098,SECTION LXXXII.,"countless gems for presenting them unto thee."" Hearing this speech,"
13099,SECTION LXXXII.,"Bharata cognizant of virtue, filled with sorrow, mentally repaired to"
13100,SECTION LXXXII.,Rāma desirous of reaping merit. Then in words choked with the melodious
13101,SECTION LXXXII.,"voice of a swan, lamented and taxed the priest, in the midst of the"
13102,SECTION LXXXII.,"assembly, ""Who like myself ever deprives one that hath led a"
13103,SECTION LXXXII.,"Brahmācharyya mode of life, that is endowed with understanding and"
13104,SECTION LXXXII.,"performed his bath after having acquired learning, and that is always"
13105,SECTION LXXXII.,"intent on righteousness, of one’s kingdom? How begot of Daçarātha, shall"
13106,SECTION LXXXII.,I deprive Rāma of his kingdom. It behoveth thee to speak righteousness
13107,SECTION LXXXII.,"before this assembly. First-born, and foremost in merit,"
13108,SECTION LXXXII.,"righteous-souled, and comparable unto Dilipa and Nahusha, Kākutstha"
13109,SECTION LXXXII.,"deserves the kingdom, just as Daçarātha did. If I commit myself to this"
13110,SECTION LXXXII.,"sin dishonorable and calculated to bring me to perdition, I shall in"
13111,SECTION LXXXII.,this world bring disgrace on the race of the Ikshwākus. I do not at all
13112,SECTION LXXXII.,relish the sin that has been committed by my mother. Remaining here with
13113,SECTION LXXXII.,joined hands I bow down unto Rāma gone to the forest fastness. I will
13114,SECTION LXXXII.,follow Rāma. That best of men is the king. Rāghava deserves the dominion
13115,SECTION LXXXII.,"of the three worlds themselves."" Hearing those words informed with"
13116,SECTION LXXXII.,"righteousness, the entire assembly with their minds intent upon Rāma,"
13117,SECTION LXXXII.,"from joy shed tears. ""If I fail to bring back the noble one from the"
13118,SECTION LXXXII.,"forest, I will like the exalted Lakshmana remain even in that forest, I"
13119,SECTION LXXXII.,will in presence of this mixed assembly of pious and honorable persons
13120,SECTION LXXXII.,"following every perfection, adopt every expedient to bring back Rāma. I"
13121,SECTION LXXXII.,have already despatched beforehand persons serving for love as well as
13122,SECTION LXXXII.,"those for money, and layers of roads and their keepers; and I intend"
13123,SECTION LXXXII.,"setting out now."" Having said this, the virtuous Bharata attached unto"
13124,SECTION LXXXII.,"his brother spoke to Sumantra skilled in counsel, who was by, saying,"
13125,SECTION LXXXII.,"""Up, and go, O Sumantra, at my command. Do thou make known this journey"
13126,SECTION LXXXII.,"and bring the forces."" Thus accosted by the magnanimous Bharata,"
13127,SECTION LXXXII.,Sumantra with a cheerful heart issued orders concerning everything
13128,SECTION LXXXII.,desirable as he was ordered. Hearing that the army had been ordered to
13129,SECTION LXXXII.,"march forth for bringing back Rāma, the subjects as well as the generals"
13130,SECTION LXXXII.,of the forces became exceedingly delighted. Hearing of the journey to
13131,SECTION LXXXII.,"Rāma, for bringing him back the wives of the soldiers apprised of the"
13132,SECTION LXXXII.,"order that had been issued to the latter, being exceedingly delighted,"
13133,SECTION LXXXII.,hurried on. And the generals expeditiously despatched their forces with
13134,SECTION LXXXII.,warriors by means of horses and carts and cars fleet as the mind. Seeing
13135,SECTION LXXXII.,"those forces marshalled, Bharata staying near his preceptor, said unto"
13136,SECTION LXXXII.,"Sumantra who was at his side, ""Do thou speedily bring my car."" In"
13137,SECTION LXXXII.,"obedience to the mandate of Bharata, Sumantra exceedingly rejoiced,"
13138,SECTION LXXXII.,appeared with the car yoked with superb steeds. Then that powerful
13139,SECTION LXXXII.,"descendant of Raghu of truthful character, and having unswerving truth"
13140,SECTION LXXXII.,"for his prowess, Bharata, having said what was fit, spoke words"
13141,SECTION LXXXII.,calculated to gladden his illustrious superior gone to the mighty
13142,SECTION LXXXII.,"forest, ""0 Sumantra, arise thou speedily and, thy desire fully attained,"
13143,SECTION LXXXII.,"go by my command, and tell the chiefs of the army, and our principal"
13144,SECTION LXXXII.,"adherents to array the forces."" Thereat rising, Rāyanyas and Vaiçyas,"
13145,SECTION LXXXII.,and Vrishalas; and Vipras in every house began to yoke camels and cars
13146,SECTION LXXXII.,and mules and elephants and excellent steeds.

13150,SECTION LXXXIII.,SECTION LXXXIII.
13151,SECTION LXXXIII.,
13152,SECTION LXXXIII.,
13153,SECTION LXXXIII.,"Rising with the morrow, Bharata anxious to behold Rāma, speedily set out"
13154,SECTION LXXXIII.,"ascending an excellent car. Before him went the councellors and priests,"
13155,SECTION LXXXIII.,ascending cars resembling that of the Sun yoked with steeds. And a
13156,SECTION LXXXIII.,thousand elephants duly consecrated went in the wake of that son of the
13157,SECTION LXXXIII.,Ikshwāku line as he was proceeding. And six thousand cars with bow-men
13158,SECTION LXXXIII.,furnished with various weapons followed the illustrious prince Bharata
13159,SECTION LXXXIII.,as he was proceeding. And a hundred thousand horses mounted (by riders)
13160,SECTION LXXXIII.,went in the wake of that descendant of Raghu intent upon truth and
13161,SECTION LXXXIII.,having his senses under control. And Kaikeyi and Sumitrā and the highly
13162,SECTION LXXXIII.,"famous Kauçalyā rejoicing at the prospect of the bringing of Rāma, went"
13163,SECTION LXXXIII.,in an effulgent car. And the honorable persons (belonging to all the
13164,SECTION LXXXIII.,three orders) went with the object of beholding Rāma in company with
13165,SECTION LXXXIII.,Lakshmana. And they with glad hearts variously conversed with each
13166,SECTION LXXXIII.,"other, ""When shall we see the mighty armed Rāma sable like unto a cloud,"
13167,SECTION LXXXIII.,"of steady strength, firm in vows, the remover of the world’s grief? As"
13168,SECTION LXXXIII.,"soon as we shall see him, Rāghava will remove our sorrow; even as the"
13169,SECTION LXXXIII.,"Sun arising dispells the darkness of the entire world."" Thus cheerfully"
13170,SECTION LXXXIII.,"carrying on an auspicious talk, the citizens embracing each other went"
13171,SECTION LXXXIII.,"a!ong. And all others, and the foremost merchants as well as all the"
13172,SECTION LXXXIII.,"principal classes, joyfully went in quest of Rāma. And a number of"
13173,SECTION LXXXIII.,"gem-cutters, and goodly potters, weavers, and armourers, and"
13174,SECTION LXXXIII.,"peacock-dancers, sawers, and perforators of gems, glass-makers, and"
13175,SECTION LXXXIII.,"workers in ivory, cooks, incense-sellers, well-known goldsmiths, and"
13176,SECTION LXXXIII.,"wool-manufacturers, bathers in tepid water, shampooers, physicians,"
13177,SECTION LXXXIII.,"makers of _Dhupas_, and wine-sellers, washermen, and tailors, and actors"
13178,SECTION LXXXIII.,"in numbers with females, and Kaivartas, and persons versed in Vedas"
13179,SECTION LXXXIII.,"having their minds in control, and Brāhmanas of reputed character, and"
13180,SECTION LXXXIII.,"persons well dressed and attired in pure habits, with their bodies"
13181,SECTION LXXXIII.,"daubed with coppery unguents, by thousands followed Bharata on carts."
13182,SECTION LXXXIII.,All these gradually followed Bharata by means of excellent vehicles. And
13183,SECTION LXXXIII.,the army delighted and in high spirits went in the wake of Kaikeyi’s son
13184,SECTION LXXXIII.,"attached unto his brother, going to bring back his brother. Going far by"
13185,SECTION LXXXIII.,"means of cars, vehicles, elephants, and horses, they arrived at the"
13186,SECTION LXXXIII.,"Gangā near Sringaverapura, where was peacefully staying that friend of"
13187,SECTION LXXXIII.,"Rāma, the heroic Guha, surrounded by his relatives, ruling the realm."
13188,SECTION LXXXIII.,"Having come to the banks of the Gangā graced with Chakravākas, the army"
13189,SECTION LXXXIII.,which was following Bharata halted. Seeing the army inactive as well as
13190,SECTION LXXXIII.,"the Gangā, of sacred waters, Bharata versed in speech spoke unto the"
13191,SECTION LXXXIII.,"courtiers, ""Do you communicating unto all our intentions, encamp the"
13192,SECTION LXXXIII.,"army. Having been fatigued, we shall cross the ocean-going Gangā, on the"
13193,SECTION LXXXIII.,"morrow. Having crossed the stream, I am anxious to offer its water unto"
13194,SECTION LXXXIII.,"the monarch, who has gone to heaven, in behalf of his spiritual body."""
13195,SECTION LXXXIII.,"When he had said this, the courtiers with collected minds saying, ""Be it"
13196,SECTION LXXXIII.,"so,"" disposed their forces, each according to his wish. Having on the"
13197,SECTION LXXXIII.,"mighty stream, Gangā, quartered his forces furnished with all appliances"
13198,SECTION LXXXIII.,"for the journey, Bharata remained there, revolving the means of making"
13199,SECTION LXXXIII.,the high-souled Rāma turn back.

13206,SECTION LXXXIV.,Seeing the forces with banners flying quartered on the banks of the
13207,SECTION LXXXIV.,"river Gangā, and engaged in various occupations, the lord of the"
13208,SECTION LXXXIV.,"Nishādas, Guha, said unto his relatives ranged around, ""This mighty host"
13209,SECTION LXXXIV.,here appeareth like an ocean. I do not find its end even by thinking of
13210,SECTION LXXXIV.,it in my mind. Surely the foolish Bharata hath come hither himself: on
13211,SECTION LXXXIV.,"his car appears the huge Kovidara, banner. Belike, he will either bind"
13212,SECTION LXXXIV.,us by nooses or slay us and next Daçarātha’s son Rāma banished from the
13213,SECTION LXXXIV.,kingdom by his sire. Desirous of taking complete possession of the rare
13214,SECTION LXXXIV.,"regal fortune of that sovereign (Rāma), Kaikeyi’s son, Bharata, comes to"
13215,SECTION LXXXIV.,destroy him. Rāma the son of Daçarātha is both my maintainer and friend.
13216,SECTION LXXXIV.,"Do ye in his interests, donning on your mail, wait on the banks of the"
13217,SECTION LXXXIV.,"river. And stationed on the river Gangā, let my powerful retainers"
13218,SECTION LXXXIV.,"subsisting on fruits and roots and meat, be prepared for opposing"
13219,SECTION LXXXIV.,Bharata’s passage over the river. And let hundreds upon hundreds of
13220,SECTION LXXXIV.,Kaivarta youths accoutred in mail remain in each of five hundred
13221,SECTION LXXXIV.,"barks.""—Guha issued this order. ""But if Bharata be well disposed towards"
13222,SECTION LXXXIV.,"Rāma, this host shall today safely cross the Gangā."" Having said this,"
13223,SECTION LXXXIV.,"the lord of the Nishādas, Guha, taking a present of flesh, fish and"
13224,SECTION LXXXIV.,"honey, went out for interviewing Bharata. Seeing Guha approaching, the"
13225,SECTION LXXXIV.,"powerful son of the charioteer knowing season, humbly informed Bharata"
13226,SECTION LXXXIV.,"of it, saying, ""This lord (that approaches) surrounded by his relatives,"
13227,SECTION LXXXIV.,is very potent in Dandaka and is an old friend of your brother.
13228,SECTION LXXXIV.,"Therefore let Guha, the lord of the Nishidas, see you, O Kākutstha. He"
13229,SECTION LXXXIV.,"indubitably knows where Rāma and Lakshmana are."" Hearing these wise"
13230,SECTION LXXXIV.,"words of Sumantra, Bharata at once said,—""Let Guha see me."" Receiving"
13231,SECTION LXXXIV.,"permission, Guha, right glad, appeared before Bharata, bending low, and"
13232,SECTION LXXXIV.,"said, ""This place is thy home. But thou hast stolen a march over us. We"
13233,SECTION LXXXIV.,dedicate all this unto thee. Do thou reside in the abode of thy servant.
13234,SECTION LXXXIV.,Here are fruits and roots gathered by the Nishādas and meat dry and
13235,SECTION LXXXIV.,moist and various other produces of the forest. I pray that entertained
13236,SECTION LXXXIV.,"in various ways and heartily partaking of meats and drinks, this army"
13237,SECTION LXXXIV.,"may spend the night here. Tomorrow morning, thou wilt go along with thy"
13238,SECTION LXXXIV.,"forces."""

13242,SECTION LXXXV.,SECTION LXXXV.
13243,SECTION LXXXV.,
13244,SECTION LXXXV.,
13245,SECTION LXXXV.,"Thus addressed, the exceedingly wise Bharata answered the lord of the"
13246,SECTION LXXXV.,"Nishādas, in words fraught with sense and reason, ""Thy great desire, O"
13247,SECTION LXXXV.,"friend of my superior, is surely as good as attained; since thou of"
13248,SECTION LXXXV.,"mighty energy hast set thy heart on entertaining my army."" Having said"
13249,SECTION LXXXV.,"these fair words unto Guha, the graceful and highly energetic Bharata"
13250,SECTION LXXXV.,"again addressed the lord of Nishādas, ""By what way shall I go to"
13251,SECTION LXXXV.,Bharadwāja’s hermitage? These lands watered by the Gangft are dense and
13252,SECTION LXXXV.,"hard to track."" Hearing these words of the intelligent son of the king,"
13253,SECTION LXXXV.,"Guha well acquainted with the forest, said with joined hands, ""My"
13254,SECTION LXXXV.,servant well acquainted with the place shall attentively follow thee;
13255,SECTION LXXXV.,"and, O prince possessed of mighty strength, I myself will also walk in"
13256,SECTION LXXXV.,thy wake. But dost thou go after Rāma of energetic acts with some evil
13257,SECTION LXXXV.,"intention? This vast force of thine raiseth my apprehension."" When Guha"
13258,SECTION LXXXV.,"had asked this, Bharata with a presence unclouded like the sky, spoke"
13259,SECTION LXXXV.,"unto Guha these sweet words, ""May a time never come when I shall do"
13260,SECTION LXXXV.,wrong onto Rāghava! It behoveth thee not to fear me. Rāghava is my
13261,SECTION LXXXV.,eldest brother dear unto me even as my sire himself. I go to make
13262,SECTION LXXXV.,"Kākutstha dwelling in the woods, turn back. Other intention cherish I"
13263,SECTION LXXXV.,"none. O Guha, this I tell thee truly."" Having heard Bharata’s speech,"
13264,SECTION LXXXV.,"Guha with a countenance lighted up with delight, again cheerfully"
13265,SECTION LXXXV.,"addressed Bharata, saying, ""Blessed art thou! Thy like find I none on"
13266,SECTION LXXXV.,"earth, inasmuch as thou wishest to resign a kingdom that comes to thee"
13267,SECTION LXXXV.,"without search. Thy eternal fame will certainly range this world, since"
13268,SECTION LXXXV.,"thou wishest to bring back Rāma passing through misfortune."" As Guha was"
13269,SECTION LXXXV.,"speaking thus unto Bharata, the Sun became shorn of his splendour and"
13270,SECTION LXXXV.,"night fell. Thereupon, having disposed his troops, the auspicious"
13271,SECTION LXXXV.,"Bharata gratified by Guha, went to bed along with Satrughna. Then arose"
13272,SECTION LXXXV.,thoughts of Rāma in the mind of the magnanimous Bharata ever having his
13273,SECTION LXXXV.,gaze fixed on virtue and undeserving (of hardship). Then even as a tree
13274,SECTION LXXXV.,"already heated by a forest-fire burns with a fire hidden in its cavity,"
13275,SECTION LXXXV.,that descendant of Raghu began to burn with the fire of grief inflamed
13276,SECTION LXXXV.,in his heart. And perspiration produced by the fire of sorrow issued out
13277,SECTION LXXXV.,"of all his limbs, as the Himavat heated by the solar warmth generates"
13278,SECTION LXXXV.,water. And Kaikeyi’s son was overpowered and drowned by the mountain of
13279,SECTION LXXXV.,"grief, having thoughts (of Rāma) for its entire crags, sighs for its"
13280,SECTION LXXXV.,"mineral substance, disgust with the avocations of life, for its trees,"
13281,SECTION LXXXV.,"mental feebleness through grief for its summits, stupor for the animals"
13282,SECTION LXXXV.,"inhabiting it, and burning for its annual shrubs and bamboos. And"
13283,SECTION LXXXV.,"sighing heavily with a heart oppressed with sorrow, well nigh deprived"
13284,SECTION LXXXV.,"of consciousness, and involved in high peril, that best of men,"
13285,SECTION LXXXV.,"oppressed by the fever of his heart, like unto a mighty leader of a"
13286,SECTION LXXXV.,"herd, separated from it, did not attain peace of mind. Meeting with"
13287,SECTION LXXXV.,"Guha, the magnanimous Bharata accompanied by his people, engrossed with"
13288,SECTION LXXXV.,"the thoughts of Rāma, became oppressed with grief. (Seeing this), Guha"
13289,SECTION LXXXV.,by and by encouraged Bharata concerning his elder brother.

13296,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Guha, acquainted with the forest, described unto Bharata of immeasurable"
13297,SECTION LXXXVI.,"prowess the regard the high-souled Lakshmana bore unto Rāma. ""To"
13298,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Lakshmana crowned with every virtue, waking up, holding the bow with the"
13299,SECTION LXXXVI.,"arrow fixed on it for the purpose of guarding well his brother, I said,"
13300,SECTION LXXXVI.,"’This easeful bed has been prepared for thee, my child. O son of Raghu’s"
13301,SECTION LXXXVI.,"descendant, cheer up! Do thou lie down at ease. All these people can"
13302,SECTION LXXXVI.,bear hardship; but thou art meant for comfort. For protecting him
13303,SECTION LXXXVI.,"religiously, we shall wake. To me also there is none that is dearer on"
13304,SECTION LXXXVI.,"earth than Rāma. Do not be anxious. This I tell thee truly, through his"
13305,SECTION LXXXVI.,"grace I expect high fame among men, and immense religious merit, and"
13306,SECTION LXXXVI.,interest and desire in entirety. Bow in hand I shall along with my kin
13307,SECTION LXXXVI.,"protect Rāma lying down with Sitā. To me always ranging in this forest,"
13308,SECTION LXXXVI.,nothing whatever is unknown. I can even cope in battle with an army of
13309,SECTION LXXXVI.,"four- fold forces.’ Thus accosted by us, the magnanimous Lakshmana with"
13310,SECTION LXXXVI.,"his gaze ever fixed on virtue, humbly observed, ’How, Daçarātha’s son"
13311,SECTION LXXXVI.,"sleeping on the earth with Sitā, can I attain sleep, or life, or"
13312,SECTION LXXXVI.,happiness? How see him who is capable of bearing in battle the onslaught
13313,SECTION LXXXVI.,"of the gods and the Asuras combined, sleeping in a cave on grass? It is"
13314,SECTION LXXXVI.,by virtue of mighty austerities and uncommon exertions that Daçarātha
13315,SECTION LXXXVI.,has obtained this son of his crowned with every auspicious sign. He
13316,SECTION LXXXVI.,"being banished, the king shall not live long; and the Earth shall"
13317,SECTION LXXXVI.,"certainly be widowed soon. Having bewailed aloud, by this time have the"
13318,SECTION LXXXVI.,women got exhausted; and surely the king’s mansion is to-day still. I do
13319,SECTION LXXXVI.,not expect that either Kauçalyā or the king or my mother is alive. If
13320,SECTION LXXXVI.,"they live, it can be for this night only. Even if my mother live seeing"
13321,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Satrughna, that mother of a hero, the afflicted Kauçalyā, will (surely)"
13322,SECTION LXXXVI.,"resign her existence. Saying—All is lost,—All is lost,—with his desire"
13323,SECTION LXXXVI.,"unattained, my father having failed to install Rāma in the kingdom, will"
13324,SECTION LXXXVI.,resign his existence. Blessed are they that when the time shall come for
13325,SECTION LXXXVI.,"the same, shall perform the funeral ceremonies of the king my deceased"
13326,SECTION LXXXVI.,sire. Then shall they with happy hearts range the metropolis of my
13327,SECTION LXXXVI.,"father, furnished with fair-looking terraces, with the highways laid out"
13328,SECTION LXXXVI.,"orderly, crowned with lordly edifices, adorned with various gems,"
13329,SECTION LXXXVI.,"crowded by cars and elephants and horses, resounding with the notes of"
13330,SECTION LXXXVI.,"trumpets, abounding in auspicious things, filled with fat and contented"
13331,SECTION LXXXVI.,"people, having gardens and pleasure-houses, and possessed of divers"
13332,SECTION LXXXVI.,"classes of men indulging festal mirth. Shall we, on the occasion of"
13333,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Rāma’s return, with glad hearts peacefully enter the city in company"
13334,SECTION LXXXVI.,with that one firm in his promise? As the magnanimous son of the king
13335,SECTION LXXXVI.,"was thus lamenting, the night passed away. In the morning, with an"
13336,SECTION LXXXVI.,"unclouded sun, both, having made matted locks on the banks of the"
13337,SECTION LXXXVI.,"Bhāgirathi, crossed the river along with me. Wearing matted locks and"
13338,SECTION LXXXVI.,"clad in barks of trees, those persons possessed of mighty strength, like"
13339,SECTION LXXXVI.,"unto leaders of elephant-herds, equipped with excellent arrows and"
13340,SECTION LXXXVI.,"quivers and bows—those repressors of foes, expecting (their return from"

13357,SECTION LXXXVII.,"who was near, taking the former on his lap, began to cry, almost"

13368,SECTION LXXXVII.,unpleasant concerning Lakshmana; or the son of that one having an only
13369,SECTION LXXXVII.,"son,¹⁷² who has gone to the forest along with his wife?"" Having taken"
13370,SECTION LXXXVII.,"comfort for a while, that one of high fame weeping, and solacing"
13371,SECTION LXXXVII.,"Kauçalyā, spoke unto Guha, saying, ""Where did my brother pass the night?"
13372,SECTION LXXXVII.,"And where did Sitā? And where did, again, Lakshmana? And in what bed did"
13373,SECTION LXXXVII.,"he sleep, and what did he previously partake of? Do thou, O Guha, tell"
13374,SECTION LXXXVII.,"me this."" Thereat, well pleased, Guha, the lord of Nishādas, related"
13375,SECTION LXXXVII.,"unto Bharata how he had acted in respect of Rāma, his dear guest,"
13376,SECTION LXXXVII.,"studious of his welfare. ""I procured for Rāma’s use rice and fruits and"
13377,SECTION LXXXVII.,roots and various kinds of food. All these Rāma having truth for his
13378,SECTION LXXXVII.,"prowess accepted, but observing Kshatriya morality, he did not take"
13379,SECTION LXXXVII.,"them. ’O friend, we ought not to take anything: ours is always to give.’"
13380,SECTION LXXXVII.,Thus did that magnanimous one beseech us. On the high-souled Lakshmana
13381,SECTION LXXXVII.,"bringing water, Righava having drunk it, fasted along with Sitā. Then"
13382,SECTION LXXXVII.,Lakshmana drank up the water that remained. Then the three with fixed
13383,SECTION LXXXVII.,"minds silently performed their adorations unto the Twilight. After that,"
13384,SECTION LXXXVII.,"Sumitrā’s son prepared a goodly bed for Rāghava, himself bringing Kuça"
13385,SECTION LXXXVII.,grass. And in that bed lay down Rāma in company with Sitā. Next washing
13386,SECTION LXXXVII.,"their feet, Lakshmana turned away. This is the foot of the Ingudi, and"
13387,SECTION LXXXVII.,this that grass. On it both Rāma and Sitā lay down that night Fastening
13388,SECTION LXXXVII.,"on his back a pair of quivers filled with arrows, furnished with"
13389,SECTION LXXXVII.,"finger-fences, and taking his mighty bow, Lakshmana all night kept watch"
13390,SECTION LXXXVII.,"around. I also taking an excellent bow, remained where remained"

13401,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"Having heard everything, Bharata in company with the counsellors went to"

13403,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"his mothers, ""That high- souled one lay down here on the ground during"
13404,SECTION LXXXVIII.,the night and his limbs pressed this spot. Begot of that foremost of
13405,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"monarchs, the exalted and intelligent Daçarātha, Rāma does not deserve"
13406,SECTION LXXXVIII.,to sleep on the earth. How can that chief of men having reposed in beds
13407,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"furnished with pillows made of deer-skins and having superb cloths, have"
13408,SECTION LXXXVIII.,lain down on the earth? Always reposing in mansions and in upper
13409,SECTION LXXXVIII.,apartments paved with silver and gold and supplied with excellent
13410,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"bed-cloths, decked with heaps of flowers, perfumed with sandal and"
13411,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"_aguru_, hued like unto pale clouds, resonant with the notes of many"
13412,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"parrots,—in palaces going before the choicest of their class, ringing"
13413,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"with music, and perfumed— like unto Meru itself, with their bases"
13414,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"composed of gold, Rāma used to be awakened with vocal and instrumental"
13415,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"music, the tinklings of elegant ornaments and the peals of goodly"
13416,SECTION LXXXVIII.,_mridangas_—that subduer of foes being in due season hymned by the
13417,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"eulogists, and friends, bards and genealogists, with worthy ballads and"
13418,SECTION LXXXVIII.,penegerycs. (This assertion of Rāma’s lying down on the ground) appears
13419,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"to me incredible: it doth by no means look unto me like truth. Forsooth,"
13420,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"I am amazed. I take it, this is a vision. Verily, no destiny is superior"
13421,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"to Time, since Daçarātha’s son, Rāma himself, had to repose on the"
13422,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"earth,—and the beauteous beloved daughter of Videha’s king, and the"
13423,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"daughter-in-law of Daçarātha, had to lie down on the ground. This was"
13424,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"the bed of my brother; on this hard spot did he turn his lovely limbs,"
13425,SECTION LXXXVIII.,and this grass was pressed by them. I think that the graceful Sitā
13426,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"adorned with ornaments slept in this bed, for here and there are"
13427,SECTION LXXXVIII.,scattered particles of gold. It is clear that Sitā had spread her sheet
13428,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"at this spot,—hence it is that fibres of silk are discoverable here. I"
13429,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"deem that the bed of her lord appeareth agreeable unto a wife, since a"
13430,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"girl tender and in affliction, the chaste daughter of Mithilā"
13431,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"experienced no inconvenience (in sleeping in one such). Ah, I am undone!"
13432,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"Baleful am I, for it is on my account that Rāghava along with his wife,"
13433,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"lay down in such a bed, like one forlorn. Born in the imperial race, and"
13434,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"capable of conferring happiness on all, the bringer-about of all good,"
13435,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"why did Rāghava of dark blue hue like that Of a lotus, graceful, and"
13436,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"crowned with red eyes, the inheriter of happiness and undeserving of"
13437,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"misery,—having left his dear consummate kingdom, lie down on the ground?"
13438,SECTION LXXXVIII.,Surely the mighty-armed Lakshmana graced with auspicious marks is
13439,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"blessed,—he who in the time of dire adversity followeth his brother"
13440,SECTION LXXXVIII.,Rāma. And blessed is Videha’s daughter who followeth her husband into
13441,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"the woods. Bereft of that magnanimous one, we have all been brought into"
13442,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"jeopardy. The Earth without her helmsman seemeth me quite empty, on"
13443,SECTION LXXXVIII.,Daçarātha having ascended the celestial regions and Rāma taken refuge in
13444,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"the wilderness. On Rāma having set up his dwelling in the forest, one"
13445,SECTION LXXXVIII.,(like me) doth not even mentally covet this earth which had been
13446,SECTION LXXXVIII.,protected by the immense prowess (of Rāghava). With her walls
13447,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"undefended, her horses and elephants unrestrained, and her gates left"
13448,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"open, the defenceless metropolis deprived of her power, placed in peril"
13449,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"and without any protection, is surely not regarded by the enemies, like"
13450,SECTION LXXXVIII.,food mixed with poison. From this day forth I will lie down on the
13451,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"ground, or on the grass, daily subsisting on fruits and roots, and"
13452,SECTION LXXXVIII.,bearing matted locks and a cloth of bark. And for his sake I will in
13453,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"future live happily in the woods. (By my doing so), the promise of that"
13454,SECTION LXXXVIII.,high-minded one shall not be rendered null. Me residing in the forest in
13455,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"the interests of my brother, Satrughna shall bear company; while my"
13456,SECTION LXXXVIII.,noble one will rule Ayodhyā assisted by Lakshmana. The twice-born ones
13457,SECTION LXXXVIII.,will sprinkle Kākutstha in Ayodhyā. May the deities realize this desire
13458,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"of mine! Propitiated by me personally in various ways with bent head, if"
13459,SECTION LXXXVIII.,"he do not consent, then shall I ever stay with Rāghava in the woods."

13478,SECTION LXXXIX.,"on his part, saying, ""Happily have we spent the night; and we have also"
13479,SECTION LXXXIX.,been well received by thee. Now let thy servants take us over by means
13480,SECTION LXXXIX.,"of many boats."" Thereat, bearing Bharata’s mandate, Guha, bestirring"
13481,SECTION LXXXIX.,"himself, re-entered the city and addressed his kinsfolk, saying, ""Arise"
13482,SECTION LXXXIX.,ye! Awake! May good always attend you! Do ye draw up the boats; I shall
13483,SECTION LXXXIX.,"ferry the forces over."" Thus asked, they arising and bestirring"
13484,SECTION LXXXIX.,"themselves in consequence of the king’s command, brought up five hundred"
13485,SECTION LXXXIX.,"boats around. Others also known by the name of Swastika, bearing large"
13486,SECTION LXXXIX.,"bells on their prows, and banners, well decked out, furnished with oars,"
13487,SECTION LXXXIX.,"and manned by bargemen, with their joints firmly constructed, (were"
13488,SECTION LXXXIX.,"brought up). And Guha himself brought a graceful barge called Swastika,"
13489,SECTION LXXXIX.,"covered with pale woolen cloth, and resounding with music. On this boat"
13490,SECTION LXXXIX.,"ascended Bharata, the mighty Satrughna, Kauçalyā, Sumitrā, and other"
13491,SECTION LXXXIX.,"wives of the king. The priests, and preceptors belonging unto the"
13492,SECTION LXXXIX.,"Brāhmana order, had already ascended. After (Bharata and others had got"
13493,SECTION LXXXIX.,"up), ascended the wives of auxiliary princes, and cars and provisions"
13494,SECTION LXXXIX.,were got on board. And the uproar consequent on the troops burning down
13495,SECTION LXXXIX.,"dwellings, pressing down descents unto the river, and loading goods,"
13496,SECTION LXXXIX.,"spread on all sides. Then those boats hung with pennons, managed by the"
13497,SECTION LXXXIX.,"kinsfolk (of Guha), set off at speed with the teeming folks that had got"
13498,SECTION LXXXIX.,"on board. And some of these were filled with women, and some with"
13499,SECTION LXXXIX.,"horses, and some conveyed cars and cattle of great value. And going to"
13500,SECTION LXXXIX.,"the other bank and landing the crowds on the store, the friends and"
13501,SECTION LXXXIX.,"slaves (of Guha) while returning, displayed various movements (of the"

13546,SECTION LXXXX.,desirous of securely enjoying the kingdom belonging to him as well to
13547,SECTION LXXXX.,"his younger brother, intend to do any harm unto that sinless one?"" Thus"

13596,SECTION LXXXXI.,"Then entering the chamber of the sacrificial fire, (Bharadwāja) having"

13604,SECTION LXXXXI.,"refined wine, and others again cool waters resembling the juice of the"

13617,SECTION LXXXXI.,"that anchoret observing excellent vows, express himself orthoepically in"
13618,SECTION LXXXXI.,consonance with Sikshā. And as he sat with joined hands facing the west
13619,SECTION LXXXXI.,"with a rapt mind, there came separately all those deities. And then"
13620,SECTION LXXXXI.,"touching Malaya and Dardura, and laden (with perfumes), a delicious and"

13628,SECTION LXXXXI.,"delightful unto the ears of men, had thus developed itself, Bharata’s"

13648,SECTION LXXXXI.,"the august royal seat, the _chowri_ and the umbrella, worthy of a king."
13649,SECTION LXXXXI.,"And having bowed down unto Rāma, he worshipped that seat. And then"
13650,SECTION LXXXXI.,"holding the _chowri_ of hair, he sat down on the seat of a minister."
13651,SECTION LXXXXI.,Then the counsellors and priests seated themselves according to rank.
13652,SECTION LXXXXI.,And thereafter the general and the protector of the encampment (got
13653,SECTION LXXXXI.,"themselves seated). Then at Bharadwāja’s command, came into being near"
13654,SECTION LXXXXI.,Bharata streams having _payaca_ for their slime. And at the pleasure of
13655,SECTION LXXXXI.,"the Brāhmana, on both their banks arose charming dwellings, covered with"
13656,SECTION LXXXXI.,pale clay. And at that very moment there came twenty thousand women
13657,SECTION LXXXXI.,"commissioned by Brahmā, adorned with divine ornaments. And there came"
13658,SECTION LXXXXI.,"also twenty thousand females sent by Kuvera, decked out in gold and"
13659,SECTION LXXXXI.,"gems, pearls and corals. The sight of these was capable of filling men’s"
13660,SECTION LXXXXI.,minds with enchanting ravishment. And there came from Nandana twenty
13661,SECTION LXXXXI.,"thousand damsels; and Nirada and Tumvuru and Gopa, resembling the sun in"
13662,SECTION LXXXXI.,splendour. The Gandharba kings began to sing before Bharata. And
13663,SECTION LXXXXI.,"Alamvusha, and Migrakesi, and Pundarikā, and Vāmana danced before"
13664,SECTION LXXXXI.,"Bharata, at the command of Bharadwāja. And those blossoms that are in"
13665,SECTION LXXXXI.,"the celestial regions, and that bloom in the forest of Chaitraratha,"
13666,SECTION LXXXXI.,became visible in Prayāga at the energy of Bharadwāja. And Vilwas did
13667,SECTION LXXXXI.,"the office of players on the _Mridanga_, and Vibhitakas, that of keepers"
13668,SECTION LXXXXI.,"of _Soma_, and Açwaththas became dancers, at the energy of Bharadwāja."
13669,SECTION LXXXXI.,"And Saralas, Tālas, Tilakas, and Tamālas, being delighted, became"
13670,SECTION LXXXXI.,"hump-backed ones and dwarfs. And Sinsapas, Amalakis, Jamvus and other"
13671,SECTION LXXXXI.,"plants of the forest, wearing the forms of females, stood at the mansion"
13672,SECTION LXXXXI.,"of Bharadwāja. ""Let wine-drinkers drink wine, the hungry eat Pāyaça, and"
13673,SECTION LXXXXI.,"those that are inclined to it, feed on clean meat."" And every seven or"
13674,SECTION LXXXXI.,"eight females taking a man, bathed him on the lovely banks of the"
13675,SECTION LXXXXI.,"rivers. And damsels furnished with expansive eyes, having wiped the"
13676,SECTION LXXXXI.,"persons (of the bathers), pressed their legs, and those magnificent"
13677,SECTION LXXXXI.,"women made them drink (wine). And the keepers duly fed excellent horses,"
13678,SECTION LXXXXI.,"elephants, camels and Suravi’s sons (oxen), with their (proper) food."
13679,SECTION LXXXXI.,"And some persons possessed of mighty strength, being directed thereto,"
13680,SECTION LXXXXI.,"fed the bearers of the foremost Ikshwāku warriors with suger-canes,"
13681,SECTION LXXXXI.,"honey, and fried paddy. And the groom forgot his horse, and the"
13682,SECTION LXXXXI.,elephant-keeper his elephant: that army there became transported with
13683,SECTION LXXXXI.,"wine and exhilaration. And sumptuously entertained with every enjoyment,"
13684,SECTION LXXXXI.,"with their bodies decked with red sandal, the soldiery in the company of"
13685,SECTION LXXXXI.,"bevies of Apsarās, exclaimed, ""To Ayodhyā will we not go, nor yet to"
13686,SECTION LXXXXI.,"Dandaka. Peace be unto Bharata, and may Rāma reap happiness""! Thus did"
13687,SECTION LXXXXI.,"footmen and the riders and keepers of elephants and horses, as well as"
13688,SECTION LXXXXI.,"others, having experienced such a state, utter words. And men by"
13689,SECTION LXXXXI.,"thousands, exceedingly delighted, sent up shouts. And saying, ""This is"
13690,SECTION LXXXXI.,"heaven"" the retinue of Bharata—the soldiers—began to dance and laugh and"
13691,SECTION LXXXXI.,"sing; and bearing garlands, they on all sides rushed by thousands. And"
13692,SECTION LXXXXI.,"beholding the inviting viands resembling ambrosia, they, although"
13693,SECTION LXXXXI.,"already fed, became desirous of eating once again. And wearing new"
13694,SECTION LXXXXI.,"clothes, all the serrante, and maids, and females of the household,"
13695,SECTION LXXXXI.,"became exceedingly well pleased. And elephants, and asses, camels, kine"
13696,SECTION LXXXXI.,"and horses, and beasts and birds, being fed their fill, did not hunger"
13697,SECTION LXXXXI.,"after anything else. And there appeared no one who wore a soiled habit,"
13698,SECTION LXXXXI.,"or who was hungry, or melancholy, or whose hair was covered with dust."
13699,SECTION LXXXXI.,And the people with wonder beheld before them vessels of precious metals
13700,SECTION LXXXXI.,"by thousands graced with chaplets of flowers, filled with essences of"
13701,SECTION LXXXXI.,"fruits and fragrant soups and curries and the flesh of goats and bears,"
13702,SECTION LXXXXI.,and white rice. And there were on the skirts of the wood wells having
13703,SECTION LXXXXI.,Pāyaça for their slime; and the kine yeilded whatever was asked; and all
13704,SECTION LXXXXI.,the trees dropped honey. And the tanks were filled with _Maireya_ as
13705,SECTION LXXXXI.,"well as with clean hot meat of deer, peacocks, and cocks, dressed in"
13706,SECTION LXXXXI.,"pans. And there were rice-holders by thousands, and curry-pots by"
13707,SECTION LXXXXI.,"hundred thousands, and golden vessels by _Arvudas_. And there were"
13708,SECTION LXXXXI.,"pitchers and water-pots and cleaned vessels for churning curd, filled"
13709,SECTION LXXXXI.,"with the same. And there were tanks of savoury and yellow butter-milk,"
13710,SECTION LXXXXI.,well-tempered. And there were tanks filled with _Rasāla_;¹⁷⁴ and others
13711,SECTION LXXXXI.,"filled with milk, and with sugar. And men saw sediments, acrid powders"
13712,SECTION LXXXXI.,"and various others things in vessels, (or the purpose of bath, on the"
13713,SECTION LXXXXI.,terraces of tanks; and tooth-cleaning sticks of Ançumān and other
13714,SECTION LXXXXI.,(trees); and white sandal paste lying before; and cleaned mirrors; and
13715,SECTION LXXXXI.,lots of cloths; and sandals; and shoes in pairs by thousands; and
13716,SECTION LXXXXI.,collyrium-pots; and combs; and brushes; and bows at some places; and
13717,SECTION LXXXXI.,mail; and various kinds of seats and beds. And they saw reservoirs for
13718,SECTION LXXXXI.,"asses, camels, elephants, and horses, with easy descents, filled with"
13719,SECTION LXXXXI.,"water to assist their digestion; and pools furnished with lotuses, of"
13720,SECTION LXXXXI.,"the hue of the firmament, with transparent water, comfortable for"
13721,SECTION LXXXXI.,ablutions; and tender (plots of) grass all around colored like blue
13722,SECTION LXXXXI.,"lapises, to serve as pasture for beasts. Witnessing the wonderful"
13723,SECTION LXXXXI.,"hospitality provided by the Maharshi Bharadwāja, like unto a vision, the"
13724,SECTION LXXXXI.,"men marvelled. Thus entertained like unto celestials in Nandana, they"
13725,SECTION LXXXXI.,passed the night at the hermitage of Bharadwāja. Then taking the
13726,SECTION LXXXXI.,"permission of Bharadwāja, all the Gandharbas as well as the superb"
13727,SECTION LXXXXI.,damsels went away as they had come. And the men remained intoxicated and
13728,SECTION LXXXXI.,"highly inebriate with the liquor, their persons daubed with goodly"
13729,SECTION LXXXXI.,_aguru_ and sandal; and the various elegant garlands beautiful to
13730,SECTION LXXXXI.,"behold, lay by themselves all around, crushed by the people."

13739,SECTION LXXXXII.,"Having passed that night, Bharata having been entertained along with his"
13740,SECTION LXXXXII.,"family, appeared before Bharadwāja, desirous (of seeing Rāma). Seeing"
13741,SECTION LXXXXII.,"that foremost of men (standing) with joined hands, Bharadwāja, who had"
13742,SECTION LXXXXII.,"just finished his fire-sacrifice, said, ""Hast thou passed the night"
13743,SECTION LXXXXII.,pleasantly at our place? And have all thy men been pleased with our
13744,SECTION LXXXXII.,"hospitality? Do thou tell me this, O sinless one."" Thereupon, Bharata"
13745,SECTION LXXXXII.,"bowing down, with joined hands said unto that ascetic of excellent"
13746,SECTION LXXXXII.,"energy, as he had issued out of his hermitage, ""O reverend Sire, I along"
13747,SECTION LXXXXII.,with all my forces and vehicles have passed (the night) happily. I have
13748,SECTION LXXXXII.,"been full well entertained by thee, O worshipful one possessed of power."
13749,SECTION LXXXXII.,"And with our languor and heat removed, we all sumptuously feasted and"
13750,SECTION LXXXXII.,"comfortably quartered, have passed (the night) agreeably along with our"
13751,SECTION LXXXXII.,"servants. Now, O best of ascetics, I beseech thee to look with a"
13752,SECTION LXXXXII.,"propitious eye on me who am bound for my brother’s place. And tell me, O"
13753,SECTION LXXXXII.,"thou cognizant of morality, how far is it unto that high-souled"
13754,SECTION LXXXXII.,"righteous one’s asylum, and by what way (shall I reach there)?"" When"
13755,SECTION LXXXXII.,"Bharata eager to see his brother had asked thus, the highly energetic"
13756,SECTION LXXXXII.,"Bharadwāja of rigid austerities answered, ""O Bharata, two and a half"
13757,SECTION LXXXXII.,"Yojanas hence, embosomed in a tenantless wood is the mountain"
13758,SECTION LXXXXII.,"Chitrakuta, charming with rocks and woods. On its northern border flows"
13759,SECTION LXXXXII.,"the river Mandākini, covered with flowering trees and with blossoming"
13760,SECTION LXXXXII.,woods. Beyond the stream is the mountain Chitrakuta. There is their
13761,SECTION LXXXXII.,"thatched cottage, my child; there they abide for certain. Proceeding by"
13762,SECTION LXXXXII.,"the southern way, do thou with thy forces composed of elephants and"
13763,SECTION LXXXXII.,"horses, O master of the army, turn to the left, O exalted one, and go"
13764,SECTION LXXXXII.,"southwards. By doing so, thou wilt be able to see Rāghava."" Hearing of"
13765,SECTION LXXXXII.,"their departure, the wives of that king of kings, leaving their cars,"
13766,SECTION LXXXXII.,"albeit worthy of them, gathered round the Brāmana. Lean and trembling"
13767,SECTION LXXXXII.,"and in woful guise, Kauçalyā along with the noble Sumitrā, with her"
13768,SECTION LXXXXII.,hands took the feet of the ascetic. Despised universally because of her
13769,SECTION LXXXXII.,"unrighteous desire, Kaikeyi also bashfully took hold of his feet, and,"
13770,SECTION LXXXXII.,"having circumambulated the mighty and venerable anchoret, stood near"
13771,SECTION LXXXXII.,Bharata in dejection of spirits. Then the mighty ascetic Bharadwāja
13772,SECTION LXXXXII.,"asked Bharata, ""O descendant of Raghu, I wish to know particularly about"
13773,SECTION LXXXXII.,"thy mothers."" Thus accosted by Bharadwāja, the pious Bharata deft in"
13774,SECTION LXXXXII.,"speech said with joined hands, ""O reverend sir, she whom thou beholdest"
13775,SECTION LXXXXII.,depressed and emaciated through grief and fasting—resembling a very
13776,SECTION LXXXXII.,"goddess—is the noble Queen of my father. This one, Kauçalyā, it is that"
13777,SECTION LXXXXII.,"gave birth unto that chief of men, having the powerful gait of a lion,"
13778,SECTION LXXXXII.,"Rāma, even as Aditi gave birth to Dhātā. She that stands at her left"
13779,SECTION LXXXXII.,"hand, in dejected guise, is the noble Sumitrā afflicted with sorrow, the"
13780,SECTION LXXXXII.,"second wife of the monarch—like a Karnikāra bough in a forest, with all"
13781,SECTION LXXXXII.,its blossoms shrivelled up. The sons of this exalted lady are the
13782,SECTION LXXXXII.,"youthful and heroic Lakshmana and Satrughna, having truth for their"
13783,SECTION LXXXXII.,"prowess, and resembling celestials in shape. And her in consequence of"
13784,SECTION LXXXXII.,"whose act those foremost of men have come by crushing misfortune, and"
13785,SECTION LXXXXII.,"the king Daçarātha hath gone to heaven, deprived of his son,—wrathful"
13786,SECTION LXXXXII.,"and proud of her good fortune, setting her heart on wealth—Kaikeyi,"
13787,SECTION LXXXXII.,"dishonorable, although endowed with the semblance of honor, do thou know"
13788,SECTION LXXXXII.,this wicked one intent on sin as my mother. In her do I perceive the
13789,SECTION LXXXXII.,"root of my mighty misfortune."" Having said this, with his words choked"
13790,SECTION LXXXXII.,"with emotion, that best of men with his eyes reddened, sighed like an"
13791,SECTION LXXXXII.,"enraged serpent. As Bharata was speaking thus, the great ascetic"
13792,SECTION LXXXXII.,"Bharadwāja gifted with high understanding and knowing interest, answered"
13793,SECTION LXXXXII.,"Bharata, saying, ""O Bharata, thou ought not to cast any blame on"
13794,SECTION LXXXXII.,"Kaikeyi. This banishment of the king (Rāma), shall be for the good (of"
13795,SECTION LXXXXII.,all). The banishment of Rāma shall surely be for the welfare of the gods
13796,SECTION LXXXXII.,"and the Asuras and sages of concentrated souls."" Thus blest, Bharata"
13797,SECTION LXXXXII.,"saluted the ascetic and went round him, and then summoning the soldiery,"
13798,SECTION LXXXXII.,"said, ""Yoke."" Thereupon, getting ready excellent steeds and cars decked"
13799,SECTION LXXXXII.,"with gold, many people mounted, with the intention of departing. And"
13800,SECTION LXXXXII.,"male and female elephants with golden chains round their necks, and"
13801,SECTION LXXXXII.,"furnished with banners, with the sounds (of bells), proceeded, like"
13802,SECTION LXXXXII.,clouds at the end of the summer season. And then proceeded various kinds
13803,SECTION LXXXXII.,of cars great and light of movement and of high value; and the infantry
13804,SECTION LXXXXII.,went on foot. And on a magnificent car went the ladies headed by
13805,SECTION LXXXXII.,"Kauçalyā, with delighted hearts, eager to see Rāghava. And ascending an"
13806,SECTION LXXXXII.,"elegant car resembling the infant sun or moon, driven by charioteers,"
13807,SECTION LXXXXII.,went the graceful Bharata well attired. And that mighty host abounding
13808,SECTION LXXXXII.,"with horses and elephants proceeded, blocking up the southern quarter,"
13809,SECTION LXXXXII.,"like a oolossal cloud arisen (in the sky), leaving behind on the other"
13810,SECTION LXXXXII.,bank of the Gangā woods inhabited by birds and beast* and coursing by
13811,SECTION LXXXXII.,rivers and. mountains. And composed of numbers of elephants and horses
13812,SECTION LXXXXII.,"in high spirits, that army of Bharata, frightening multitudes of beasts"
13813,SECTION LXXXXII.,"and birds, dived into that mighty forest."

13822,SECTION LXXXXIII.,in company with the herds themselves. And bears and Prishatas and Rurus
13823,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"were on all sides seen in the forest-ways, and on hills and rivers. And"
13824,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"that virtuous son of Daçarātha with a glad heart held on his way,"
13825,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"surrounded by that vast army consisting of fourfold forces, raising a"
13826,SECTION LXXXXIII.,tremendous upoar. And that army of the high-souled Bharata resembling
13827,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"the waves of the ocean, covered the earth quite, as clouds in the rainy"
13828,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"season cover the welkin. And filled with steeds and mighty elephants,"
13829,SECTION LXXXXIII.,the earth at that time for a long while remained invisible. And having
13830,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"proceeded a long way, the graceful Bharata, with his bearers extremely"
13831,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"tired, said these words unto that foremost of counsellors, Vasishtha,"
13832,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"""From appearances, and from what I had heard, it is evident that we have"
13833,SECTION LXXXXIII.,arrived at that region which Bharadwāja had told us of. This is the
13834,SECTION LXXXXIII.,mountain Chitrakuta and that the river Mandākini. And from a distance
13835,SECTION LXXXXIII.,this forest appeareth like dark clouds. And now our elephants resembling
13836,SECTION LXXXXIII.,hills afflict the romantic sides of Chitrakuta. And the trees scatter
13837,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"blossoms over the sides of the mountain, even as after summer sable"
13838,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"clouds pour down showers. O Satrughna, behold the realms inhabited by"
13839,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"Kinnaras, scattered with steeds, like the main with _makaras_. And these"
13840,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"herds of deer furnished with celerity, being urged on, roam about like"
13841,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"masses of clouds in the sky in autumn, propelled by the winds. And like"
13842,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"the people of the south, these warriors bearing shields resembling"
13843,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"clouds, are adorning their heads with ornaments of perfumed blossoms."
13844,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"And this forest, although void of men and dreadful in appearance, at"
13845,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"present appeareth unto me like Ayodhyā, teeming with people. The dust"
13846,SECTION LXXXXIII.,raised by the hoofs (of horses) stands covering the sky: anon the wind
13847,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"bearing it away, compasses my pleasure. And, O Satrughna, see how fast"
13848,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"these cars yoked with steeds and driven by skilful charioteers, are"
13849,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"proceeding in the forest. And behold these beauteous peacocks, which,"
13850,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"being frightened, take refuge in the mountain —the home of feathered"
13851,SECTION LXXXXIII.,tribes. This country appears to me exceedingly lovely. This abode of the
13852,SECTION LXXXXIII.,ascetics is like onto the way to heaven itself. Male and female deer and
13853,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"Prishatas in the forest, beautiful to look at, appear as if variegated"
13854,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"with flowers. Now let the soldiers go advisedly and search this forest,"
13855,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"so that they light upon those chiefs of men, Rāma and Lakshmana."""
13856,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"Hearing Bharata’s speech, persons with weapons in their hands, plunged"
13857,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"into the forest, and those heroes presently discovered the top of a"
13858,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"(column of) smoke. Having seen the top of the (column of) smoke, they"
13859,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"came before Bharata and said, ""Fire cannot exist where there is no man"
13860,SECTION LXXXXIII.,present. Therefore it is evident that even here are those descendants of
13861,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"Raghu. But if those foremost of men, those subduers of their enemies,"
13862,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"the princes, be not here, there are others, being ascetics, resembling"

13865,SECTION LXXXXIII.,"here: do not proceed further. I myself will go, and Sumantra and"

14036,SECTION LXXXXVI.,"by slaying Bharata, who had formerly done us wrong. On this one being"
14037,SECTION LXXXXVI.,"slain, you will rule the entire earth. To day shall Kaikeyi lusting"
14038,SECTION LXXXXVI.,"after the kingdom, with grief behold her son slain in battle by me, like"
14039,SECTION LXXXXVI.,a tree riven by an elephant. I will also kill Kaikeyi along (with the
14040,SECTION LXXXXVI.,"hump-backed one), and her friends. Let the earth today be freed from"
14041,SECTION LXXXXVI.,"foul sins. To day will I, O bestower of honor, vent my restrained ire"
14042,SECTION LXXXXVI.,"and bad blood upon the hostile hosts, like fire set to a heap of hay."
14043,SECTION LXXXXVI.,To-day with sharpened shafts will I cut the bodies of the hostile hosts

14134,SECTION LXXXXVIII.,"moon, with eyes expansive like lotuses, I shall not attain peace of"

14202,SECTION LXXXXIX.,sheaths and scimitars and shields spangled with gold and nice guana
14203,SECTION LXXXXIX.,finger-fences decked with gold; inaccessible unto foes like a lions’s
14204,SECTION LXXXXIX.,den unto deer; and furnished with a spacious dais inclined on the
14205,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"north-east, with a fire flaming on it. And looking around, anon Bharata"
14206,SECTION LXXXXIX.,saw his superior Rāma seated in the cottage bearing a head of matted
14207,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"locks, clad in a black deer-skin, and having tattered cloth and bark for"
14208,SECTION LXXXXIX.,his garment. And he saw Rāma seated like unto a flame—with leonine
14209,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"shoulders, mighty arms, and eyes resembling lotuses—the righteous lord"
14210,SECTION LXXXXIX.,of this world bounded by the seas—saw the mighty-armed one like unto the
14211,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"eternal Brahmā, seated on a skin-seat on the ground along with Sitā and"
14212,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"Lakshmana. And seeing him, overwhelmed with grief and affliction, the"
14213,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"righteous and graceful son of Kaikeyi, Bharata, rushed (towards him)."
14214,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"And soon as Bharata saw Rāma, he, exceedingly distressed,broke out into"
14215,SECTION LXXXXIX.,lamentations in words choked with sorrow. And incapable of holding
14216,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"himself in patience, he said, ""That elder brother of mine, who (seated)"
14217,SECTION LXXXXIX.,in court should be surrounded by the subjects intent upon paying him
14218,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"homage, is now surrounded by wild deer. He that used to adorn his person"
14219,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"with attire worth many thousands (of things), engaged in observing"
14220,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"morality, is clad in deer-skin. Why doth he that always wore variegated"
14221,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"blossoms, Rāghava, beareth this burthen of matted locks? He who is"
14222,SECTION LXXXXIX.,worthy of acquiring religious merit by celebrating sacrifices according
14223,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"to the ordinance, is now following morality by afflicting his person."
14224,SECTION LXXXXIX.,How is the person of that one whose body used to be daubed with costly
14225,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"sandal, covered with dust? It is for me that Rāma, although deserving of"
14226,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"comfort, has come by this misfortune. Wicked that I am, fie upon my life"
14227,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"despised of men!"" Thus lamenting in woful guise, with the lotus of his"
14228,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"countenance covered with sweat, Bharata coming at Rāma’s feet, fell at"
14229,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"them bewailing. And inflamed with grief, the exceedingly powerful prince"
14230,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"Bharata, having in distress of spirit uttered, ""O noble one,"" again said"
14231,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"nothing. And beholding the illustrious Rāma, Bharata with his utterance"
14232,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"choked with emotion, exclaimed, ""O noble one,"" and was unable to say"
14233,SECTION LXXXXIX.,anything further. Then Satrughna also weeping paid homage unto the feet
14234,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"of Rāma. And shedding tears, Rāma embraced them both. Then as in the"
14235,SECTION LXXXXIX.,"sky, the Sun and the Moon meet with Sukra and Vrihashpati, those two"
14236,SECTION LXXXXIX.,princes (Rāma and Lakshmana) met with Sumantra and Guha in the forest.
14237,SECTION LXXXXIX.,And beholding those kings resembling leaders of elephant-herds met

14254,SECTION C.,forest while he is living. Ah! I see thee come from far after a long
14255,SECTION C.,"time. Why, my child, hast thou come unto this gloomy forest? Is the king"
14256,SECTION C.,"alive, my child, seeing that thou hast come hither; or, afficted with"
14257,SECTION C.,"grief, hath he suddenly gone to the other world? And, O mild one, child"

14261,SECTION C.,"Açwamedha, ever devoted to righteousness, king Daçarātha, well? And, my"
14262,SECTION C.,"child, is that exceedingly effulgent and learned Brāhmana ever steady in"
14263,SECTION C.,"morality, the priest of the Ikshwākus, duly honored? And, my child, are"
14264,SECTION C.,"Kauçalyā, and Sumitrā having a son, in happiness? And is the noble"
14265,SECTION C.,"Kaikeyi in spirits? And is that one, sprung from a mighty line, humble"

14270,SECTION C.,thee of the proper seasons for performing the fire-sacrifice? A dost
14271,SECTION C.,"thou regard the deities, the ancestral manes, the preceptors like unto"

14273,SECTION C.,"not disregard the preceptor Sudhanwā, versed in excellent arms whether"
14274,SECTION C.,"inspired with _mantras_ or not, and accomplished in the knowledge of"
14275,SECTION C.,"polity? And, my child, hast thou employed as thy concillors, persons,"
14276,SECTION C.,"heroic, learned, self-controlled, well-born, and understanding signs,"
14277,SECTION C.,"who are like thy own self? O descendant of Raghu, counsel well kept by"

14282,SECTION C.,"alone, or (on the other hand) with a multiplicity of counsellors? And"
14283,SECTION C.,"thy counsel doth not range the kingdom (i. e. doth not take air)? And, O"

14545,SECTION CIII.,Hearing those piteous words uttered by Bharata in connection with the

14549,SECTION CIII.,"subduer of foes, Rāma, stretching his arms, fell down to the earth, like"

14563,SECTION CIII.,"Ah! Bharata, thou, O sinless one, art blessed, since by thee as well as"

14575,SECTION CIII.,Bharata has communicated unto me the sad intelligence that our father
14576,SECTION CIII.,"hath ascended heaven."" When Kākutstha had said this, tears began to"

14579,SECTION CIII.,"unto him, ""Do thou perform the watery rites of that lord of the earth,"
14580,SECTION CIII.,"our sire."" Having heard that her father-in-law, the king, had gone to"
14581,SECTION CIII.,"the celestial regions. Sitā with her eyes filled with tears, could not"

14590,SECTION CIII.,"the king, having cheered up Rāghava, brought him to the auspicious"
14591,SECTION CIII.,"river, Mandākini. Then those illustrious ones, having in distress"
14592,SECTION CIII.,"arrived at the river Mandākini, having convenient descents, charming,"
14593,SECTION CIII.,"ever furnished with blossoming woods, and of rapid currents; and"
14594,SECTION CIII.,"approached its descents, goodly and void of mud, offered water unto the"
14595,SECTION CIII.,"monarch, uttering, ""May this be so!"" And the protector of the earth"
14596,SECTION CIII.,"(Rāma), holding water with his joined hands, facing the south, said"
14597,SECTION CIII.,"weeping, ""O foremost of monarchs, may this clear water knowing no"

14599,SECTION CIII.,"manes!"" Then drawing nigh unto the marge of the Mandākini, the energetic"
14600,SECTION CIII.,"Rāghava along with his brothers, offered the _Pinda_ unto his father."
14601,SECTION CIII.,And placing the Ingudi _Pinda_ mixed with juyube on a bed of _darbha_
14602,SECTION CIII.,"Rāma crying in distress, said, ""O mighty monarch, do thou well pleased"
14603,SECTION CIII.,"feed on this, which we also live upon. That which is the fare of an"

14605,SECTION CIII.,"men ascending the bank of the stream by the self-same way, got up on the"

14610,SECTION CIII.,perceiving the loud uproar of those mighty ones engaged in offering
14611,SECTION CIII.,"water unto their sire, indulging in lamentations, the army of Bharata"
14612,SECTION CIII.,"became agitated. And they said, ""For certain Bharata hath met with Rāma;"
14613,SECTION CIII.,"and this mighty noise proceeds from them, as they are bitterly mourning"
14614,SECTION CIII.,"their deceased sire."" Thereat leaving aside their vehicles, they with"
14615,SECTION CIII.,"one mind, rushed towards the spot wherefrom proceeded the uproar. And of"
14616,SECTION CIII.,"those that were tender, some went on horses, and some on elephants, and"
14617,SECTION CIII.,"some on ornamented chariots, while others went on foot. And eager to"
14618,SECTION CIII.,"behold Rāma staying away for a short time, though seeming to do so for a"
14619,SECTION CIII.,"long period, all the men at once went to the hermitage. And desirous of"
14620,SECTION CIII.,"witnessing the meeting of the brothers (with Rāma), they with all"
14621,SECTION CIII.,despatch proceeded by means of various vehicles consisting of beasts and
14622,SECTION CIII.,"cars. And the ground trodden by the wheels of innumerable cars, emitted"
14623,SECTION CIII.,"loud sounds, like those emitted by the sky on clouds gathering. And"
14624,SECTION CIII.,"frightened by the uproar, elephants accompanied by female ones,"
14625,SECTION CIII.,"perfuming all sides (by the fragrance of temporal juice), went to"
14626,SECTION CIII.,"another forest. And boars, and deer, and lions, and buffalos, and"
14627,SECTION CIII.,"_Srimaras_, and tigers, and _Gokarnas_, _Gayals_ and _Prishatas_ were"
14628,SECTION CIII.,"striken with panic. And wild with alarm, Chakravākas and swans, and"
14629,SECTION CIII.,"_Natyuhas_, and _Plavas_, and _Karandavas_, and male coels, and"
14630,SECTION CIII.,"_Kraunchas_, fled away in all directions. And the welkin was enveloped"
14631,SECTION CIII.,"by birds frightened by the noise, as the earth was covered by men, and"
14632,SECTION CIII.,both the sky and the land then gave out great effulgence. As the people

14634,SECTION CIII.,"seated on the ground, accusing Kaikeyi as well as the vile Mantharā, the"

14636,SECTION CIII.,"Seeing those men oppressed with grief with their eyes filled with tears,"
14637,SECTION CIII.,"that one cognizant of virtue like fathers and mothers, embraced those"
14638,SECTION CIII.,that deserved it And he embraced some persons; and some offered him
14639,SECTION CIII.,"salutations. And the king’s son, as each deserved, properly received"
14640,SECTION CIII.,"them along with their friends and equals in age. And the sounds,"
14641,SECTION CIII.,"produced by those high souled persons lamenting, resounding the earth"
14642,SECTION CIII.,"and the sky, and the mountain-caverns, and all the cardinal points, were"

14652,SECTION CIV.,"were going slowly by the Mandākini, they discovered the landing-place"
14653,SECTION CIV.,"which was used by Rāma and Lakshmana. Thereupon Kauçalyā, with her eyes"

14656,SECTION CIV.,"unto a first wife, in this forest this is the landing-place of those"
14657,SECTION CIV.,"unfortunate ones of untiring energy, who had been deprived of the"
14658,SECTION CIV.,"kingdom. From here, O Sumitrā, doth thy son, Saumitri, ever vigilant,"
14659,SECTION CIV.,personally procure water for my son. Although thy son performeth a
14660,SECTION CIV.,"servile office, yet he is not to blame: (the performance of) that alone"
14661,SECTION CIV.,"which serves no purpose of his brother possessed of many perfections,"
14662,SECTION CIV.,"could bring blame upon him. To day let thy son, who doth not deserve"
14663,SECTION CIV.,"such toilsome work, cease to perform that office which is fraught with"
14664,SECTION CIV.,"hardships fit only for the base."" That lady of expansive eyes happened"
14665,SECTION CIV.,"to see on the earth the _Ingudi pinda_, which had been placed by Rāma"
14666,SECTION CIV.,for his sire on the _darbha_ with their tops pointing southwards. Seeing
14667,SECTION CIV.,"this, which had been placed on the ground by Rāma disconsolate for his"
14668,SECTION CIV.,"sire, the noble Kauçalyā addressed all the wives of Daçarātha, saying,"
14669,SECTION CIV.,"""Do ye behold this that hath been duly offered to the high-souled"
14670,SECTION CIV.,descendant of Raghu—lord of the Ikshvāku race—by Rāghava. I do not deem
14671,SECTION CIV.,"this as fit fare for that magnanimous monarch resembling a celestial,"
14672,SECTION CIV.,who had enjoyed every luxury (in life). Having enjoyed this earth
14673,SECTION CIV.,"bounded by the four seas, how can that lord of the world, resembling on"
14674,SECTION CIV.,"earth the mighty Indra, feed on this _Ingudi pinda_? Nothing appeareth"
14675,SECTION CIV.,to me more deplorable in this world than this that the auspicious Rāma
14676,SECTION CIV.,hath offered an _Ingudi_ cake unto his father. Seeing the _Ingudi pinda_
14677,SECTION CIV.,"offered by Rāma unto his father, why doth not my heart break into a"
14678,SECTION CIV.,"thousand shivers? Now the tradition in vogue among men, appearth to be"
14679,SECTION CIV.,"true, viz., that ""the fare that is partaken by a person, is also"
14680,SECTION CIV.,"partaken by his deity."" Then those that were co-wives with her, consoled"
14681,SECTION CIV.,"the distressed Kauçalyā; and, (entering the asylum), beheld Rāma like an"
14682,SECTION CIV.,"immortal dropped from the celestial regions. Seeing Rāma, who had been"
14683,SECTION CIV.,"deprived of every comfort, his mothers, overwhehhed with grief and"
14684,SECTION CIV.,"distress, began to shed tears, lamenting. Raising his mothers, that"
14685,SECTION CIV.,"foremost of men, Rāma, true to his promise, took hold of those lotus"
14686,SECTION CIV.,"feet of theirs. And those ones furnished with expansive eyes, (on their"
14687,SECTION CIV.,turn) by means of their fair hands of delicious feel furnished with soft
14688,SECTION CIV.,"fingers and palms, fell to rubbing the dust off Rāma’s back. After Rāma"
14689,SECTION CIV.,"had done, Sumitrā’s son also, seeing all his mothers, with sorrow gently"
14690,SECTION CIV.,"paid his reverence unto them with affection. Thereat, as they had"
14691,SECTION CIV.,"treated Rāma, all the ladies treated that one sprung from Daçarātha,"
14692,SECTION CIV.,"Lakshmana, graced with auspicious marks. Sitā also with her eyes filled"
14693,SECTION CIV.,"with tears, having taken hold of the feet of her mothers-in- law, stood"
14694,SECTION CIV.,before them in distressful guise. Embracing that woeful one in
14695,SECTION CIV.,"banishment, even as a mother doth her daughter, Kauçalyā, smitten with"
14696,SECTION CIV.,"grief, said, ""The daughter of Videha’s King, and the daughter-in-law of"

14701,SECTION CIV.,"begot of this vortex of disaster that is in my mind, fiercely burneth"
14702,SECTION CIV.,"me, as fire consumeth a structure."" As his wretched mother was thus"
14703,SECTION CIV.,"speaking, Bharata’s elder brother, Rāghava, approaching, took the feet"
14704,SECTION CIV.,of Vasishtha. Having taken hold of the feet of the priest resembling a
14705,SECTION CIV.,"flame, and of accumulated energy,—like unto that lord of the immortals,"
14706,SECTION CIV.,"Indra, taking the feet of Vrihaspati, Rāghava sat down with him. Then"
14707,SECTION CIV.,"behind them (Rāma and Vasishtha), along with his own counsellors, and"
14708,SECTION CIV.,"principal citizens, and generals, and persons of eminent piety,—sat the"

14712,SECTION CIV.,"great Indra of controlled faculties in presence of Prajapāti. ""What will"

14716,SECTION CIV.,"Laksmana endowed with magnanimity, and Bharata possessed of"

14729,SECTION CV.,"unto Rāma. And sitting silent, no one said anything. Then Bharata"
14730,SECTION CV.,"addressed Rāma in the midst of those friends, saying, ""My mother was"
14731,SECTION CV.,(first) pacified (by grant of the kingdom.) The kingdom is (now) mine. I
14732,SECTION CV.,grant the same unto thee. Do thou enjoy the kingdom rid of its thorns.
14733,SECTION CV.,"Like unto a dyke forced by a torrent during the rains, this mighty"

14735,SECTION CV.,"incapable of imitating the course of a horse, or as birds, that of"
14736,SECTION CV.,"Tarkshya, I, O Lord of earth, lack the strength to imitate thee. O Rāma,"
14737,SECTION CV.,ever happy is the life of him that others depend upon for subsistence:
14738,SECTION CV.,unhappy is the life of the person that depends upon others for support.
14739,SECTION CV.,"As a tree planted by a person, and by him made to increase, (until at"

14742,SECTION CV.,contribute to the satisfaction of htm for whom it hath been planted. O
14743,SECTION CV.,"mighty- armed one, this comparison is meant for thee. This¹⁸⁹ it behoves"
14744,SECTION CV.,"thee to apprehend, inasmuch as thou art our excellent lord, and thou"

14746,SECTION CV.,"orders, O monarch, behold thee, represser of foes—established in the"
14747,SECTION CV.,"kingdom, like the powerful sun himself. O Kākustha, let mad elephants"
14748,SECTION CV.,"roar, with the view of following thee; and let the women of the inner"
14749,SECTION CV.,"apartments with concentrated minds utter jubilation."" On hearing the"
14750,SECTION CV.,"words of Bharata, who was beseeching Rāma, many of the citizens"
14751,SECTION CV.,"expressed their approbation by exclaiming, ""Excellent well!"" Seeing the"
14752,SECTION CV.,"illustrious Bharata aggrieved and engaged in lamentation, the calm and"
14753,SECTION CV.,"considerate Rāma consoled him, saying, ""No creature is endowed wth the"
14754,SECTION CV.,"power of exercising any control over the course of events,—man has no"
14755,SECTION CV.,independent status (in nature). The Destoyer draws him both here and
14756,SECTION CV.,"hereafter. Those that increase, are destined to deteriorate; those that"
14757,SECTION CV.,"go upward, ultimately fall, those that come together, separate in the"
14758,SECTION CV.,end; and life at length meets with death. As a ripe fruit hath no other
14759,SECTION CV.,"fear than fall, so man who is born, hath no other fear than death. Even"
14760,SECTION CV.,"as a stout-pillared edifice, getting dilapidated, waxes weak, so men"
14761,SECTION CV.,"coming under the sway of decrepitude and death, get enfeebled. A night"
14762,SECTION CV.,"that hath gone by, doth not return, as the full Jamunā, when she hath"

14766,SECTION CV.,deplore thyself. Why dost thou lament any thing else? Every one’s life
14767,SECTION CV.,"is decreasing, whether he sits or moves. Death goeth with one, sitteth"

14776,SECTION CV.,"piece of wood comes in contact with another; so, a person, having been"

14778,SECTION CV.,"wives and sons and kindred and wealth, having been in association, go"

14780,SECTION CV.,that can change one’s nature as received. A person lamenting a dead

14845,SECTION CVI.,overpower a person like thyself furnished with such virtues and
14846,SECTION CVI.,cognizant of life and death. The sin that in my absence from home hath
14847,SECTION CVI.,been perpetrated by my mean-minded mother doth not find favor in my

14851,SECTION CVI.,"Daçarātha of righteous deeds and born of immaculate race, and knowing"

14872,SECTION CVI.,"viz.,—getting oneself installed,—by means of which, O highly wise one,"

14877,SECTION CVI.,after having righteously ruled the four orders. O thou cognizant of
14878,SECTION CVI.,"morality, those versed in duty say that of the four modes of life, the"

15375,SECTION CXIII.,"feet. And after having again and again gone round Bharadwāja, the"
15376,SECTION CXIII.,graceful Bharata went to Ayodhyā accompaniad by his counsellors. And
15377,SECTION CXIII.,"returning by means of cars and carts, horses and elephants, that army"
15378,SECTION CXIII.,"marching in the wake of Bharata, spread wide. And after having crossed"
15379,SECTION CXIII.,"the beautiful river Yamunā flowing in waves, they again beheld the river"
15380,SECTION CXIII.,Gangā of auspicious waters. And having along with his friend crossed
15381,SECTION CXIII.,"over that river filled with beautiful waters, Bharata together with his"
15382,SECTION CXIII.,army entered the charming city of Sringava. And from the city of
15383,SECTION CXIII.,Sringava he went to Ayodhyā and again beheld it. And seeing Ayodhyā
15384,SECTION CXIII.,"bereft of his father and mother, Bharata burning in grief, said unto the"
15385,SECTION CXIII.,"charioteer, ""O charioteer, behold that Ayodhyā, which shorn of its"

15437,SECTION CXIV.,"is not heard the mild neighing of steeds, the rattle of vehicles, the"

15477,SECTION CXV.,"having spoken to his mothers, that graceful one ascended the car in"

15480,SECTION CXV.,"priests. And going ahead, all the preceptors headed by Vasishtha"

15489,SECTION CXV.,"work of government, protecting what the people have and securing unto"
15490,SECTION CXV.,"them what they have not."" Then bowing unto the sandals which represented"
15491,SECTION CXV.,"the trust, Bharata burning in grief addressed the entire body of the"
15492,SECTION CXV.,"subjects, saying, ""Do ye speedily hold the umbrella (over these"

15494,SECTION CXV.,"these sandals of my superior, will be established the regal morality (of"

15497,SECTION CXV.,"putting these sandals on Rāghava’s feet, I shall behold them with the"

15504,SECTION CXV.,"Having consigned all rule unto the sandals, Bharata himself held the"

15517,SECTION CXVI.,"in Chitrakuta, relying upon Rāma (for their protection), he found to be"
15518,SECTION CXVI.,wrought up with anxiety. And by means of signs by the eye and
15519,SECTION CXVI.,"contractions of the brow, they, afflicted with fear, were, alluding to"
15520,SECTION CXVI.,"Rāma, slowly speaking to each other. Perceiving their anxiety, Rāma"
15521,SECTION CXVI.,"apprehensive of himself, with joined hands addressed the patriarchal"

15526,SECTION CXVI.,"is unworthy of him? Doth not Sitā engaged in serving you, having to"
15527,SECTION CXVI.,"serve me, now minister unto you as a woman should?"" Thereat a certain"
15528,SECTION CXVI.,"aged and decrepit ascetic, with his frame trembling, said upto Rāma ever"

15530,SECTION CXVI.,"excellent character, engaged in offices of beneficence,—more specially"
15531,SECTION CXVI.,with reference to ascetics? This fear arising from Rākshasas afflicts
15532,SECTION CXVI.,"the ascetics because of thee and they, extremely agitated, converse with"
15533,SECTION CXVI.,"each other (on the subject). A Rākshasa named Khara, a younger brother"
15534,SECTION CXVI.,"of Rāvana, hath been harassing the ascetics dwelling in Janasthāna. And"
15535,SECTION CXVI.,Dhrishta also a fearless and wicked Rākshasa feeding on human
15536,SECTION CXVI.,"beings,—and the unrighteous Avalipta, cannot bear thee, my child. As"
15537,SECTION CXVI.,"long, my child, as thou hast been residing in this asylum, the Rākshasas"
15538,SECTION CXVI.,have been plaguing the ascetics. And they show themselves sometimes in
15539,SECTION CXVI.,"disgusting shapes, sometimes in horrible and dreadful ones,—in various"
15540,SECTION CXVI.,frightful forms capable of frightening folks. And they throw execrable
15541,SECTION CXVI.,"and unclean things among the anchorets, and torment those that happen to"
15542,SECTION CXVI.,come before them. And they take delight in approaching asylums
15543,SECTION CXVI.,"unperceived, and slaughtering ascetics, after having bound them by means"
15544,SECTION CXVI.,"of their arms. And on the occasion of sacrifices, they throw away the"
15545,SECTION CXVI.,"vessels containing sacrificial articles, pour water on the sacrificial"
15546,SECTION CXVI.,fire and break vessels containing water. Eager to renounce this asylum
15547,SECTION CXVI.,"infested by those wicked ones, and removing to another place, the sages"
15548,SECTION CXVI.,"today have been exhorting me (on the subject). And, O Rāma, ere this,"
15549,SECTION CXVI.,those wicked ones have slain ascetics. Therefore we would renounce this
15550,SECTION CXVI.,asylum. Not far from here is a picturesque wood abounding in fruits and
15551,SECTION CXVI.,roots. Thither shall I betake myself together with my own folks. Khara
15552,SECTION CXVI.,"shall also annoy thee. If thou think it proper, go hence in company with"
15553,SECTION CXVI.,"us. O Rāghava, although thou art vigilant, able, and in all ways"

15577,SECTION CXVII.,memory. And in consequence of the troops of that high- souled one having
15578,SECTION CXVII.,quartered here as well as the dung discharged by his elephants and
15579,SECTION CXVII.,"horses, this place has got exceedingly dirty. Therefore will I go to"
15580,SECTION CXVII.,"another quarter."" Having settled this in his mind, Rāghava departed"
15581,SECTION CXVII.,along with Videha’s daughter and Lakshmana. And having arrived at Atri’s
15582,SECTION CXVII.,"asylum, that renowned one paid obeisance (unto the sage); and the"

15584,SECTION CXVII.,"personally given Rāma respectful reception and entertainment, the"

15587,SECTION CXVII.,"been paid homage, the sage cognizant of virtue ever engaged in the good"
15588,SECTION CXVII.,"of all creatures, gladdened her (by presenting Sitā unto her.) And that"
15589,SECTION CXVII.,"best of sages said unto the pious fetnale ascetic, Anasuyā, engaged in"

15593,SECTION CXVII.,"drouth extending over ten years. O sinless one, that one resembling thy"
15594,SECTION CXVII.,"mother is this, by whom furnished with rigid asceticsim and adorned with"
15595,SECTION CXVII.,"voluntary penances, were created fruits and roots and the Jāhnavi was"
15596,SECTION CXVII.,made to flow through the asylum; by whom were performed mighty
15597,SECTION CXVII.,"austerities for ten thousand years,—in virtue of whose penances,"
15598,SECTION CXVII.,"disturbances to the asceticism of the sages ceased,— by whom ten nights"
15599,SECTION CXVII.,were brought within the compass of a single one. Let Vaidehi always
15600,SECTION CXVII.,"resort to this aged ascetic devoid of anger, who is worthy of being"
15601,SECTION CXVII.,"bowed down to by all creatures."" When the saint had spoken thus, Rāghava"

15603,SECTION CXVII.,"one knowing morality, ""O princess, thou hast heard what hath been"

15614,SECTION CXVII.,"hands, enquired after her welfare. Seeing the virtuous Sitā engaged in"
15615,SECTION CXVII.,"righteous acts, the old lady consoling her, said ""By luck it is that"

15617,SECTION CXVII.,"banishing pride, thou hast, O honored lady, followed Rāma staying in the"

15669,SECTION CXVIII.,"strength, ""All this hath been done by thee."" Thus accosted, that one"
15670,SECTION CXVIII.,"cognizant of virtue, was still more pleased, and said, ""I am exceedingly"
15671,SECTION CXVIII.,pleased (with thy words). I will attain a desire of mine. This noble and
15672,SECTION CXVIII.,"grand garland, this apparel, these ornaments, and this precious paste"
15673,SECTION CXVIII.,"for adorning the person, presented by me— let these, O Sitā, grace thy"
15674,SECTION CXVIII.,"person. These, worthy of thee will never be tarnished. O daughter of"
15675,SECTION CXVIII.,"Janaka, daubing thy person with this excellent paint, thou wilt grace"
15676,SECTION CXVIII.,"thy husband even as Sree doth the undeteriorating Vishnu."" Thereupon"
15677,SECTION CXVIII.,"Mithilā’s daughter accepted those things presented unto her out of love,"
15678,SECTION CXVIII.,"viz., the apparel, the paint, the ornaments and the garland. Having"
15679,SECTION CXVIII.,"accepted those presents conferred on her from love, that illustrious"
15680,SECTION CXVIII.,"one, Sitā, quietly sat beside the female ascetic with joined hands. Then"
15681,SECTION CXVIII.,"as Sitā was sitting, Anasuyā firm in vow asked her concerning a thing"
15682,SECTION CXVIII.,"that was near her heart, saying, ""I have heard, O Sitā, that thou wert"
15683,SECTION CXVIII.,won by the renowned Rāghava on the occasion of a self-choice. O
15684,SECTION CXVIII.,"Maithili, that story I should like to hear, related at length. It"
15685,SECTION CXVIII.,"therefore behoves thee to relate that unto me in detail."" Thus"
15686,SECTION CXVIII.,"addressed, Sitā, saying unto the ascetic engaged in pious acts,"
15687,SECTION CXVIII.,"""Listen!"" began to tell the story. ""Mithilā’s lord, the heroic Janaka,"
15688,SECTION CXVIII.,"justly ruleth the earth, engaged in observing the duties of Kshatriyas."
15689,SECTION CXVIII.,"As he was ploughing a plain intended for a sacrifice, I rose from under"
15690,SECTION CXVIII.,the earth; and (in this sense) I am the daughter of that king. Tending
15691,SECTION CXVIII.,"me, with my body covered with dust, Janaka, engaged in throwing handfuls"
15692,SECTION CXVIII.,"of dust (to level hollow spots), was struck with amazement. Being"
15693,SECTION CXVIII.,"childless, he took me on his lap from affection, and saying—’This is my"
15694,SECTION CXVIII.,"daughter’, conceived affection for me. Then there were uttered words in"
15695,SECTION CXVIII.,"the welkin, resembling those of a human being,—’O king, in all"
15696,SECTION CXVIII.,"righteousness, this is thy daughter.’ Then well-pleased, my righteous"
15697,SECTION CXVIII.,"father,the king, lord of Mithilā, receiving me, attained mighty good"
15698,SECTION CXVIII.,"fortune. Consigned unto the pious eldest noble one (queen), desirous of"
15699,SECTION CXVIII.,"having offspring, I was brought up by that mild lady, with the"
15700,SECTION CXVIII.,tenderness of a mother. (In time) seeing me fit for the company of a
15701,SECTION CXVIII.,"husband, my father in distress was plunged in thought, like a poor man"
15702,SECTION CXVIII.,that hath lost his wealth. Even if the father of a girl be like unto
15703,SECTION CXVIII.,"Sakra himself on earth, he reapeth odium at the hands of his equals and"
15704,SECTION CXVIII.,"inferiors. Perceiving this obloquy at a short distance, the king was"
15705,SECTION CXVIII.,"plunged in a sea of anxiety, but could not cross it, like one that hath"
15706,SECTION CXVIII.,"no raft. Knowing me as unborn from any female vessel, the lord of earth"
15707,SECTION CXVIII.,"reflecting upon it, could not come upon a suitable and fit husband for"
15708,SECTION CXVIII.,"me. Then as he reflected, this thought occurred to him ’I will"
15709,SECTION CXVIII.,righteously celebrate the self-choice of my daughters’. In the great
15710,SECTION CXVIII.,"sacrifice of Daksha, the high-souled Varuna had well-pleased conferred"
15711,SECTION CXVIII.,on Devarāta an excellent bow with inexhaustible arrows and a couple of
15712,SECTION CXVIII.,"quivers. Incapable of being moved on account of its weight, the kings"
15713,SECTION CXVIII.,"could not even dream of bending the bow. Having obtained the bow, my"
15714,SECTION CXVIII.,"truthful father said, ’No fear!’ inviting at the same time the kings to"
15715,SECTION CXVIII.,"an assembly of sovereigns. ’He that, raising the bow, shall string it,"
15716,SECTION CXVIII.,shall doubtless receive my daughter for his wife.’ Seeing that best of
15717,SECTION CXVIII.,"bows in weight resembling a hill, the kings saluting it, go away, unable"
15718,SECTION CXVIII.,"to move it. And it came to pass that after a long time, this highly"
15719,SECTION CXVIII.,effulgent Rāghava came to witness the sacrifice in company with
15720,SECTION CXVIII.,"Viçwāmitra. And Rāma having truth for his prowess, and the righteous"
15721,SECTION CXVIII.,Viçwāmitra were respectfully received by my sire. Then Viçwāmitra said
15722,SECTION CXVIII.,"unto my father, ’The descendants of Raghu, sons of Daçarātha, Rāma and"
15723,SECTION CXVIII.,"Lakshmana, are anxious to behold the bow.’ Thus accosted by the Vipra,"
15724,SECTION CXVIII.,"my father brought the bow, and showed that celestial bow unto the"
15725,SECTION CXVIII.,"princes. Thereupon, in the twinkling of an eye, bending it, the powerful"
15726,SECTION CXVIII.,"(Rāghava) stringed the bow and drew it. And is he drew it vehemently, it"
15727,SECTION CXVIII.,broke in the middle in twain. And the sound of it was dreadful like unto
15728,SECTION CXVIII.,the bursting of a thunder-bolt. Then raising an excellent vessel of
15729,SECTION CXVIII.,"water, my truthful father prepared to bestow me on Rāghava. And bestowed"
15730,SECTION CXVIII.,"on Rāghava, I was accepted of him, after he had consulted the wish of"
15731,SECTION CXVIII.,"his father, that lord, the master of Ayodhyā. And inviting my"
15732,SECTION CXVIII.,"father-in-law, the old king Daçarātha, my father bestowed me on Rāma,"
15733,SECTION CXVIII.,having a knowledge of self. And my father bestowed on Lakshmana for his
15734,SECTION CXVIII.,"wife, my younger sister, the beauteous and chaste Urmilā. Thus was I"
15735,SECTION CXVIII.,bestowed on Rāma on the occasion of that self-choice. And ever since I
15736,SECTION CXVIII.,"have been devoted unto my husband, the foremost of those possessing"
15737,SECTION CXVIII.,"prowess."""
15738,SECTION CXVIII.,
15739,SECTION CXVIII.,"Having heard this grand story, Anasuyā cognizant of righteousness,"
15740,SECTION CXVIII.,"smelling the head of Mithilā’s daughter, embraced Sitā with her arms. ""I"
15741,SECTION CXVIII.,"have heard all that thou, describing the self-choice, hast spoken"
15742,SECTION CXVIII.,sweetly and beautifully in articulated letters and feet. O
15743,SECTION CXVIII.,"sweet-speeched one, I have been delighted with thy narration. But"
15744,SECTION CXVIII.,"ushering in the auspicious night, the graceful Sun hath set. And there"
15745,SECTION CXVIII.,"are heard the notes of feathered ones, which, after having gone about in"
15746,SECTION CXVIII.,search of food are resting now for the purpose of sleeping. And these
15747,SECTION CXVIII.,"ascetics having bathed, are wending their way in a body, carrying"
15748,SECTION CXVIII.,"water-pitchers, their barks drenched with water. And the smoke arising"
15749,SECTION CXVIII.,"from the fire-sacrifice duly performed by the ascetics,—reddish like the"
15750,SECTION CXVIII.,"hue of the pigeon’s neck, is seen, wafted by the wind. And trees of"
15751,SECTION CXVIII.,spare foliage appear dense (on all sides); and distance is no longer
15752,SECTION CXVIII.,perceptible. And animals ranging in the night are going about all round;
15753,SECTION CXVIII.,"and those deer of the asylum are reposing on the daises. O Sitā, the"
15754,SECTION CXVIII.,"night crested by the stars hath arrived; and, veiled in moonlight,"
15755,SECTION CXVIII.,appeareth the moon in the heavens. Go thou; I permit thee. Do thou seek
15756,SECTION CXVIII.,"the society of Rāma. I have been pleased with thy sweet converse. And, O"
15757,SECTION CXVIII.,"daughter of Mithilā, do thou deck thyself before me. Do thou thus please"
15758,SECTION CXVIII.,"me, my child, thou that lookest beautiful with excellent ornaments."""
15759,SECTION CXVIII.,"Thereat, having adorned herself, Sitā, resembling the daughter of a"
15760,SECTION CXVIII.,"celestial, bowing down to the feet (of the female ascetic), directed her"
15761,SECTION CXVIII.,"steps towards Rāma. And that best of speakers, Rāghava, saw Sitā, decked"
15762,SECTION CXVIII.,with the ornaments affectionately presented by the ascetic; and he
15763,SECTION CXVIII.,"rejoiced thereat. Then Mithilā’s daughter, Sitā, related unto Rāma all"
15764,SECTION CXVIII.,about her having been affectionately presented by the ascetic with
15765,SECTION CXVIII.,"attire, ornaments and the garland. Thereupon, witnessing the honor that"
15766,SECTION CXVIII.,"had been accorded unto Maithili,— rare among men, Rāma became well"
15767,SECTION CXVIII.,"pleased,—as also that mighty car-warrior, Lakshmana. Then Raghu’s son,"
15768,SECTION CXVIII.,"ministered unto by the ascetic, happily spent the delightful night"
15769,SECTION CXVIII.,"there, with her face resembling the moon. On the night having passed"
15770,SECTION CXVIII.,"away, those foremost of men, after performing their ablutions, enquired"
15771,SECTION CXVIII.,"of the ascetics performing fire-sacrifices, who lived in the forest."
15772,SECTION CXVIII.,Thereat the righteous ascetics ranging the forest said that all the
15773,SECTION CXVIII.,"sides of the forest were infested by Rākshasas. ""Ferocious beasts"
15774,SECTION CXVIII.,"feasting on blood, and Rākshasas, O Rāghava, living on human"
15775,SECTION CXVIII.,"beings,—wearing various shapes, abide in this mighty forest. These eat"
15776,SECTION CXVIII.,"up ascetics leading the Brahmācharya mode of life, who happen to be"
15777,SECTION CXVIII.,"unclean or heedless. Do thou, therefore, O Rāghava, let them. This is"
15778,SECTION CXVIII.,"the path of the Maharshis, who procure fruits in the forest. By this way"
15779,SECTION CXVIII.,"thou wilt be able to enter the impracticable wild, O Rāghava."" Thus"
15780,SECTION CXVIII.,"addressed by the ascetic twice-born ones, and having been blessed by"
15781,SECTION CXVIII.,"them, that repressor of foes, Rāghava, entered the forest in company"
15782,SECTION CXVIII.,"with his wife and Lakshmana, like the sun entering a mass of clouds."
