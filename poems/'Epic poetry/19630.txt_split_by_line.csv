67,ASTRA DARSANA,
68,ASTRA DARSANA,(The Tournament)
69,ASTRA DARSANA,
70,ASTRA DARSANA,
71,ASTRA DARSANA,The scene of the Epic is the ancient kingdom of the Kurus which
72,ASTRA DARSANA,flourished along the upper course of the Ganges; and the historical
73,ASTRA DARSANA,fact on which the Epic is based is a great war which took place
74,ASTRA DARSANA,"between the Kurus and a neighbouring tribe, the Panchalas, in the"
75,ASTRA DARSANA,thirteenth or fourteenth century before Christ.
76,ASTRA DARSANA,
77,ASTRA DARSANA,"According to the Epic, Pandu and Dhrita-rashtra, who was born blind,"
78,ASTRA DARSANA,"were brothers. Pandu died early, and Dhrita-rashtra became king of"
79,ASTRA DARSANA,"the Kurus, and brought up the five sons of Pandu along with his"
80,ASTRA DARSANA,hundred sons.
81,ASTRA DARSANA,
82,ASTRA DARSANA,"Yudhishthir, the eldest son of Pandu, was a man of truth and piety;"
83,ASTRA DARSANA,"Bhima, the second, was a stalwart fighter; and Arjun, the third son,"
84,ASTRA DARSANA,distinguished himself above all the other princes in arms. The two
85,ASTRA DARSANA,"youngest brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva, were twins. Duryodhan was"
86,ASTRA DARSANA,"the eldest son of Dhrita-rashtra and was jealous of his cousins, the"
87,ASTRA DARSANA,"sons of Pandu. A tournament was held, and in the course of the day"
88,ASTRA DARSANA,"a warrior named Karna, of unknown origin, appeared on the scene and"
89,ASTRA DARSANA,proved himself a worthy rival of Arjun. The rivalry between Arjun
90,ASTRA DARSANA,"and Karna is the leading thought of the Epic, as the rivalry between"
91,ASTRA DARSANA,Achilles and Hector is the leading thought of the Iliad.
92,ASTRA DARSANA,
93,ASTRA DARSANA,"It is only necessary to add that the sons of Pandu as well as Karna,"
94,ASTRA DARSANA,"were, like the heroes of Homer, god-born chiefs. Some god inspired"
95,ASTRA DARSANA,"the birth of each. Yudhishthir was the son of Dharma or Virtue, Bhima"
96,ASTRA DARSANA,"of Vayu or Wind, Arjun of Indra or Rain-god, the twin youngest were"
97,ASTRA DARSANA,"the sons of the Aswin twins, and Karna was the son of Surya the Sun,"
98,ASTRA DARSANA,but was believed by himself and by all others to be the son of a
99,ASTRA DARSANA,simple chariot-driver.

107,I,The Gathering
108,I,
109,I,"Wrathful sons of Dhrita-rashtra, born of Kuru's royal race!"
110,I,"Righteous sons of noble Pandu, god-born men of godlike grace!"
111,I,
112,I,"Skill in arms attained these princes from a Brahman warrior bold,"
113,I,"Drona, priest and proud preceptor, peerless chief of days of old!"
114,I,
115,I,"Out spake Drona to the monarch in Hastina's royal hall,"
116,I,"Spake to Bhishma and to Kripa, spake to lords and courtiers all:"
117,I,
118,I,"""Mark the gallant princes, monarch, trained in arms and warlike art,"
119,I,"Let them prove their skill and valour, rein the steed and throw the dart."""
120,I,
121,I,"Answered then the ancient monarch, joyful was his royal heart,"
122,I,"""Best of Brahmans and of warriors, nobly hast thou done thy part!"
123,I,
124,I,"Name the place and fix the moment, hold a royal tournament,"
125,I,"Publish wide the laws of combat, publish far thy king's consent."
126,I,
127,I,"Sightless roll these orbs of vision, dark to me is noonday light,"
128,I,Happier men will mark the tourney and the peerless princes' fight.
129,I,
130,I,"Let the good and wise Vidura serve thy mandate and behest,"
131,I,"Let a father's pride and gladness fill this old and cheerless breast."""
132,I,
133,I,"Then the good and wise Vidura unto his duties bound,"
134,I,"Drona, blessed with skill and wisdom, measured out the tourney ground,"
135,I,
136,I,"Clear of jungle was the meadow, by a crystal fountain graced,"
137,I,"Drona on the lighted altar holy gifts and offerings placed,"
138,I,
139,I,"Holy was the star auspicious, and the hour was calm and bright,"
140,I,Men from distant town and hamlet came to view the sacred rite.
141,I,
142,I,"Then arose white stately mansions, built by architects of fame,"
143,I,"Decked with arms for Kuru's monarch and for every royal dame,"
144,I,
145,I,"And the people built their stages circling round the listed green,"
146,I,And the nobles with their white tents graced the fair and festive scene.
147,I,
148,I,"Brightly dawned the festal morning, and the monarch left his hall,"
149,I,"Bhishma and the pious Kripa with the lords and courtiers all,"
150,I,
151,I,"And they came unto the mansions, gay and glittering, gold-encased,"
152,I,"Decked with gems and rich _baidurya_, and with strings of pearls be-laced."
153,I,
154,I,"Fair Gandhari, queen of Kuru, Pritha, Pandu's widowed dame,"
155,I,"Ladies in their gorgeous garments, maids of beauty and of fame,"
156,I,
157,I,"Mounted on their glittering mansions where the tints harmonious blend,"
158,I,"As, on Meru's golden mountain, queens of heavenly gods ascend!"
159,I,
160,I,"And the people of the city, Brahmans, Vaisyas, Kshatras bold,"
161,I,"Men from stall and loom and anvil gathered thick, the young and old,"
162,I,
163,I,"And arose the sound of trumpet and the surging people's cry,"
164,I,"Like the voice of angry ocean, tempest-lashed, sublime and high!"
165,I,
166,I,"Came the saintly white-robed Drona, white his sacrificial thread,"
167,I,"White his sandal-mark and garlands, white the locks that crowned his head,"
168,I,
169,I,"With his son renowned for valour walked forth Drona, radiant, high,"
170,I,So the Moon with Mars conjoinéd walks upon the cloudless sky!
171,I,
172,I,"Offerings to the gods immortal then the priestly warrior made,"
173,I,"Brahmans with their chanted _mantra_ worship and obeisance paid,"
174,I,
175,I,"And the festive note of _sankha_ mingled with the trumpet's sound,"
176,I,"Throngs of warriors, various-arméd, came unto the listed ground."
177,I,
178,II,II
179,II,
180,II,The Princes
181,II,
182,II,"Gauntleted and jewel-girdled, now the warlike princes came,"
183,II,"With their stately bows and quivers and their swords like wreaths of flame,"
184,II,
185,II,"Each behind his elder stepping, good Yudhishthir first of all,"
186,II,Each his wondrous skill displaying held the silent crowds in thrall.
187,II,
188,II,"And the men in admiration marked them with a joyful eye,"
189,II,Or by sudden panic stricken stooped to let the arrow fly!
190,II,
191,II,"Mounted on their rapid coursers oft the princes proved their aim,"
192,II,"Racing, hit the targe with arrows lettered with their royal name,"
193,II,
194,II,"With their glinting sunlit weapons shone the youths sublime and high,"
195,II,"More than mortals seemed the princes, like _gandharvas_ of the sky!"
196,II,
197,II,"Shouts of joy the people uttered as by sudden impulse driven,"
198,II,Mingled voice of tens of thousands struck the pealing vault of heaven!
199,II,
200,II,"Still the princes shook their weapons, drove the deep resounding car,"
201,II,Or on steed or tusker mounted waged the glorious mimic war!
202,II,
203,II,"Mighty sword and ample buckler, ponderous mace the princes wield,"
204,II,"Brightly gleam their lightning rapiers as they range the listed field,"
205,II,
206,II,"Brave and fearless is their action, and their movement quick and light,"
207,II,Skilled and true the thrust and parry of their weapons flaming bright!
208,II,
209,III,III
210,III,
211,III,Bhima and Duryodhan
212,III,
213,III,"Bhima came and proud Duryodhan with their maces held on high,"
214,III,Like two cliffs with lofty turrets cleaving through the azure sky!
215,III,
216,III,"In their warlike arms accoutred with their girded loins they stood,"
217,III,Like two untamed jungle tuskers in the deep and echoing wood!
218,III,
219,III,"And as tuskers range the forest, so they range the spacious field,"
220,III,Right to left and back they wander and their ponderous maces wield!
221,III,
222,III,"Unto Kuru's sightless monarch wise Vidura drew the scene,"
223,III,Pritha proudly of the princes spake unto the Kuru queen.
224,III,
225,III,"While the stalwart Bhima battled with Duryodhan brave and strong,"
226,III,"Fierce in wrath, for one or other, shouted forth the maddened throng,"
227,III,
228,III,"""Hail to Kuru prince Duryodhan!"" ""Hail to Bhima hero proud!"""
229,III,Sounds like these from surging myriads rose in tumult deep and loud.
230,III,
231,III,"And with troubled vision Drona marked the heaving restless plain,"
232,III,"Marked the crowd by anger shaken, like the tempest-shaken main,"
233,III,
234,III,"To his son then whispered Drona quick the tumult to appease,"
235,III,"Part the armed and angry wrestlers, bid the deadly combat cease,"
236,III,
237,III,"With their lifted clubs the princes slow retired on signal given,"
238,III,"Like the parting of the billows, mighty-heaving, tempest-driven!"
239,III,
240,III,"Came forth then the ancient Drona on the open battle-ground,"
241,III,"Stopped the drum and lofty trumpet, spake in voice like thunder's sound:"
242,III,
243,III,"""Bid him come, the gallant Arjun! pious prince and warrior skilled,"
244,III,"Arjun, born of mighty INDRA, and with VISHNU'S prowess filled."""
245,III,
246,IV,IV
247,IV,
248,IV,The Advent of Arjun
249,IV,
250,IV,"Gauntleted and jewel-girdled, with his bow of ample height,"
251,IV,"Archer Arjun pious-hearted to the gods performed a rite,"
252,IV,
253,IV,"Then he stepped forth proud and stately in his golden mail encased,"
254,IV,Like the sunlit cloud of evening with the golden rainbow graced!
255,IV,
256,IV,"And a gladness stirred the people all around the listed plain,"
257,IV,Voice of drum and blare of trumpet rose with _sankha's_ festive strain!
258,IV,
259,IV,"""Mark! the gallant son of Pandu, whom the happy Pritha bore,"
260,IV,"Mark! the heir of INDRA'S valour, matchless in his arms and lore,"
261,IV,
262,IV,"Mark! the warrior young and valiant, peerless in his skill of arms,"
263,IV,"Mark! the pure-souled, pious chieftain, decked with grace and varied"
264,IV,"charms!"""
265,IV,
266,IV,"Pritha heard such grateful voices borne aloft unto the sky,"
267,IV,"Milk of love suffused her bosom, tear of joy was in her eye!"
268,IV,
269,IV,"And where rested Kuru's monarch, joyous accents struck his ear,"
270,IV,And he turned to wise Vidura seeking for the cause to hear:
271,IV,
272,IV,"""Wherefore like the voice of ocean, when the tempest winds prevail,"
273,IV,"Rise these voices of the people and the spacious skies assail?"""
274,IV,
275,IV,"Answered him the wise Vidura, ""It is Pritha's gallant boy,"
276,IV,"Godlike moves in golden armour, and the people shout for joy!"""
277,IV,
278,IV,"""Pleased am I,"" so spake the monarch, ""and I bless my happy fate,"
279,IV,"Pritha's sons like fires of _yajna_ sanctify this mighty State!"""
280,IV,
281,IV,"Now the voices of the people died away and all was still,"
282,IV,Arjun to his proud preceptor showed his might and matchless skill.
283,IV,
284,IV,"Towering high or lowly bending, on the turf or on his car,"
285,IV,"With his bow and glist'ning arrows Arjun waged the mimic war,"
286,IV,
287,IV,"Targets on the wide arena, mighty tough or wondrous small,"
288,IV,"With his arrows bright, unfailing, Arjun pierced them one and all!"
289,IV,
290,IV,"Wild-boar shaped of solid iron coursed the wide-extending field,"
291,IV,"In its jaws five glist'ning arrows sent the archer wondrous-skilled,"
292,IV,
293,IV,"Cow-horn by a thread suspended, was by winds unceasing swayed,"
294,IV,"One and twenty well-aimed arrows on this moving mark he laid,"
295,IV,
296,IV,"And with equal skill his rapier did the godlike Arjun wield,"
297,IV,Whirling round his mace of battle ranged the spacious tourney field!
298,IV,
299,V,V
300,V,
301,V,The Advent of Karna
302,V,
303,V,"Now the feats of arm are ended, and the closing hour draws nigh,"
304,V,"Music's voice is hushed in silence, and dispersing crowds pass by,"
305,V,
306,V,"Hark! Like welkin-shaking thunder wakes a deep and deadly sound,"
307,V,Clank and din of warlike weapons burst upon the tented ground!
308,V,
309,V,"Are the solid mountains splitting, is it bursting of the earth,"
310,V,Is it tempest's pealing accent whence the lightning takes its birth?
311,V,
312,V,"Thoughts like these alarm the people for the sound is dread and high,"
313,V,To the gate of the arena turns the crowd with anxious eye!
314,V,
315,V,"Gathered round preceptor Drona, Pandu's sons in armour bright,"
316,V,"Like the five-starred constellation round the radiant Queen of Night,"
317,V,
318,V,"Gathered round the proud Duryodhan, dreaded for his exploits done,"
319,V,"All his brave and warlike brothers and preceptor Drona's son,"
320,V,
321,V,"So the gods encircled INDRA, thunder-wielding, fierce and bold,"
322,V,When he scattered Danu's children in the misty days of old!
323,V,
324,V,"Pale, before the unknown warrior, gathered nations part in twain,"
325,V,"Conqueror of hostile cities, lofty Karna treads the plain!"
326,V,
327,V,"In his golden mail accoutred and his rings of yellow gold,"
328,V,"Like a moving cliff in stature, arméd comes the chieftain bold!"
329,V,
330,V,"Pritha, yet unwedded, bore him, peerless archer on the earth,"
331,V,"Portion of the solar radiance, for the Sun inspired his birth!"
332,V,
333,V,"Like a tusker in his fury, like a lion in his ire,"
334,V,"Like the sun in noontide radiance, like the all-consuming fire!"
335,V,
336,V,"Lion-like in build and muscle, stately as a golden palm,"
337,V,"Blessed with every very manly virtue, peerless warrior proud and calm!"
338,V,
339,V,"With his looks serene and lofty field of war the chief surveyed,"
340,V,Scarce to Kripa or to Drona honour and obeisance made!
341,V,
342,V,"Still the panic-stricken people viewed him with unmoving gaze,"
343,V,"Who may be this unknown warrior, questioned they in hushed amaze!"
344,V,
345,V,Then in voice of pealing thunder spake fair Pritha's eldest son
346,V,"Unto Arjun, Pritha's youngest, each, alas! to each unknown!"
347,V,
348,V,"""All thy feats of weapons, Arjun, done with vain and needless boast,"
349,V,"These and greater I accomplish--witness be this mighty host!"""
350,V,
351,V,"Thus spake proud and peerless Karna in his accents deep and loud,"
352,V,And as moved by sudden impulse leaped in joy the listening crowd!
353,V,
354,V,"And a gleam of mighty transport glows in proud Duryodhan's heart,"
355,V,Flames of wrath and jealous anger from the eyes of Arjun start!
356,V,
357,V,"Drona gave the word, and Karna, Pritha's war-beloving son,"
358,V,With his sword and with his arrows did the feats by Arjun done!
359,V,
360,VI,VI
361,VI,
362,VI,The Rival Warriors
363,VI,
364,VI,"Joyful was the proud Duryodhan, gladness gleamed upon his face,"
365,VI,And he spake to gallant Karna with a dear and fond embrace:
366,VI,
367,VI,"""Welcome, mighty arméd chieftain! thou hast victor's honours won!"
368,VI,"Thine is all my wealth and kingdom, name thy wish and it is done!"""
369,VI,
370,VI,"Answered Karna to Duryodhan, ""Prince! thy word is good as deed,"
371,VI,"But I seek to combat Arjun and to win the victor's meed!"""
372,VI,
373,VI,"""Noble is the boon thou seekest,"" answered Kuru's prince of fame,"
374,VI,"""Be a joy unto your comrades, let the foeman dread thy name!"""
375,VI,
376,VI,"Anger flamed in Arjun's bosom, and he spake in accents rude"
377,VI,Unto Karna who in triumph calm and proud and fearless stood:
378,VI,
379,VI,"""Chief! who comest uninvited, pratest in thy lying boast,"
380,VI,"Thou shalt die the death of braggarts--witness be this mighty host!"""
381,VI,
382,VI,"Karna answered calm and proudly, ""Free this listed field to all,"
383,VI,"Warriors enter by their prowess, wait not, Arjun, for thy call!"
384,VI,
385,VI,"Warlike chieftains take their places by their strength of arm and might,"
386,VI,"And their warrant is their falchion, valour sanctifies their right!"
387,VI,
388,VI,"Angry word is coward's weapon, Arjun, speak with arrows keen,"
389,VI,"Till I lay thee, witness Drona, low upon the listed green!"""
390,VI,
391,VI,"Drona gave the word impartial, wrathful Arjun, dread of foes,"
392,VI,"Parted from his loving brothers, with his glist'ning arms arose,"
393,VI,
394,VI,"Karna clasped the Kuru's princes, parted from them one and all,"
395,VI,With his bow and ample quiver proudly stepped the warrior tall.
396,VI,
397,VI,"Now the clouds with lurid flashes gathered darkling, thick and high,"
398,VI,Lines of cranes like gleams of laughter sailed across the gloomy sky.
399,VI,
400,VI,"Rain-god INDRA over Arjun watched with father's partial love,"
401,VI,"Sun-god SURYA over Karna shed his light from far above,"

1062,RAJASUYA,
1063,RAJASUYA,(The Imperial Sacrifice)
1064,RAJASUYA,
1065,RAJASUYA,
1066,RAJASUYA,A curious incident followed the bridal of Draupadi. The five sons of
1067,RAJASUYA,"Pandu returned with her to the potter's house, where they were"
1068,RAJASUYA,"living on alms according to the custom of Brahmans, and the brothers"
1069,RAJASUYA,reported to their mother that they had received a great gift on that
1070,RAJASUYA,"day. ""Enjoy ye the gift in common,"" replied their mother, not knowing"
1071,RAJASUYA,"what it was. And as a mother's mandate cannot be disregarded,"
1072,RAJASUYA,Draupadi became the common wife of the five brothers.
1073,RAJASUYA,
1074,RAJASUYA,The real significance of this strange legend is unknown. The custom
1075,RAJASUYA,of brothers marrying a common wife prevails to this day in Thibet and
1076,RAJASUYA,"among the hill-tribes of the Himalayas, but it never prevailed among"
1077,RAJASUYA,the Aryan Hindus of India. It is distinctly prohibited in their laws
1078,RAJASUYA,"and institutes, and finds no sanction in their literature, ancient or"
1079,RAJASUYA,"modern. The legend in the _Maha-bharata_, of brothers marrying a wife"
1080,RAJASUYA,"in common, stands alone and without a parallel in Hindu traditions"
1081,RAJASUYA,and literature.
1082,RAJASUYA,
1083,RAJASUYA,"Judging from the main incidents of the Epic, Draupadi might rather be"
1084,RAJASUYA,regarded as the wife of the eldest brother Yudhishthir. Bhima had
1085,RAJASUYA,"already mated himself to a female in a forest, by whom he had a son,"
1086,RAJASUYA,"Ghatotkacha, who distinguished himself in war later on. Arjun too"
1087,RAJASUYA,"married the sister of Krishna, shortly after Draupadi's bridal, and"
1088,RAJASUYA,"had by her a son, Abhimanyu, who was one of the heroes of the war. On"
1089,RAJASUYA,"the other hand, Yudhishthir took to him self no wife save Draupadi,"
1090,RAJASUYA,and she was crowned with Yudhishthir in the Rajasuya or Imperial
1091,RAJASUYA,"Sacrifice. Notwithstanding the legend, therefore, Draupadi might be"
1092,RAJASUYA,"regarded as wedded to Yudhishthir, though won by the skill of Arjun,"
1093,RAJASUYA,"and this assumption would be in keeping with Hindu customs and laws,"
1094,RAJASUYA,ancient and modern.
1095,RAJASUYA,
1096,RAJASUYA,The jealous Duryodhan heard that his contrivance to kill his cousins
1097,RAJASUYA,at Varanavata had failed. He also heard that they had found a
1098,RAJASUYA,"powerful friend in Drupad, and had formed an alliance with him. It"
1099,RAJASUYA,was no longer possible to keep them from their rightful inheritance.
1100,RAJASUYA,The Kuru kingdom was accordingly parcelled; Duryodhan retained the
1101,RAJASUYA,eastern and richer portion with its ancient capital _Hastina-pura_ on
1102,RAJASUYA,the Ganges; and the sons of Pandu were given the western portion on
1103,RAJASUYA,"the Jumna, which was then a forest and a wilderness. The sons of"
1104,RAJASUYA,"Pandu cleared the forest and built a new capital _Indra-prastha_, the"
1105,RAJASUYA,"supposed ruins of which, near modern Delhi, are still pointed out to"
1106,RAJASUYA,the curious traveller.
1107,RAJASUYA,
1108,RAJASUYA,"Yudhishthir, the eldest of the five sons of Pandu, and now king of"
1109,RAJASUYA,"Indra-prastha, resolved to perform the Rajasuya sacrifice, which"
1110,RAJASUYA,was a formal assumption of the Imperial title over all the kings of
1111,RAJASUYA,ancient India. His brothers went out with troops in all directions
1112,RAJASUYA,"to proclaim his supremacy over all surrounding kings. Jarasandha,"
1113,RAJASUYA,"the powerful and semi-civilised king of Magadha or South Behar,"
1114,RAJASUYA,opposed and was killed; but other monarchs recognised the supremacy
1115,RAJASUYA,of Yudhishthir and came to the sacrifice with tributes. King
1116,RAJASUYA,"Dhrita-rashtra and his sons, now reigning at Hastina-pura, were"
1117,RAJASUYA,politely invited to take a share in the performance of the sacrifice.

2104,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"True to their word the sons of Pandu went with Draupadi into exile,"
2105,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,and passed twelve years in the wilderness; and many were the
2106,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"incidents which checkered their forest life. Krishna, who had stood"
2107,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"by Yudhishthir in his prosperity, now came to visit him in his"
2108,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"adversity; he consoled Draupadi in her distress, and gave good advice"
2109,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,to the brothers. Draupadi with a woman's pride and anger still
2110,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"thought of her wrongs and insults, and urged Yudhishthir to disregard"
2111,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,the conditions of exile and recover his kingdom. Bhima too was of the
2112,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"same mind, but Yudhishthir would not be moved from his plighted word."
2113,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,
2114,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"The great _rishi_ Vyasa came to visit Yudhishthir, and advised Arjun,"
2115,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"great archer as he was, to acquire celestial arms by penance and"
2116,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"worship. Arjun followed the advice, met the god SIVA in the guise"
2117,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"of a hunter, pleased him by his prowess in combat, and obtained his"
2118,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,blessings and the _pasupata_ weapon. Arjun then went to INDRA'S
2119,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,heaven and obtained other celestial arms.
2120,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,
2121,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"In the meanwhile Duryodhan, not content with sending his cousins to"
2122,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"exile, wished to humiliate them still more by appearing before them"
2123,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,in all his regal power and splendour. Matters how ever turned out
2124,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"differently from what he expected, and he became involved in a"
2125,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"quarrel with some _gandharvas_, a class of aerial beings. Duryodhan"
2126,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"was taken captive by them, and it was the Pandav brothers who"
2127,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"released him from his captivity, and allowed him to return to his"
2128,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,kingdom in peace. This act of generosity rankled in his bosom and
2129,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,deepened his hatred.
2130,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,
2131,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"Jayadratha, king of the Sindhu or Indus country, and a friend and"
2132,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"ally of Duryodhan, came to the woods, and in the absence of the"
2133,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,Pandav brothers carried off Draupadi. The Pandavs however pursued the
2134,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"king, chastised him for his misconduct, and rescued Draupadi."
2135,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,
2136,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,Still more interesting than these various incidents are the tales and
2137,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,legends with which this book is replete. Great saints came to see
2138,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"Yudhishthir in his exile, and narrated to him legends of ancient"
2139,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"times and of former kings. One of these beautiful episodes, the tale"
2140,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"of Nala and Damayanti, has been translated into graceful English"
2141,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"verse by Dean Milman, and is known to many English readers. The"
2142,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,legend of Agastya who drained the ocean dry; of Parasu-Rama a
2143,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,Brahman who killed the Kshatriyas of the earth; of Bhagiratha who
2144,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,brought down the Ganges from the skies to the earth; of Manu and the
2145,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,universal deluge; of Vishnu and various other gods; of Rama and his
2146,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,deeds which form the subject of the Epic _Ramayana_;--these and
2147,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,various other legends have been inter woven in the account of the
2148,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"forest-life of the Pandavs, and make it a veritable storehouse of"
2149,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,ancient Hindu tales and traditions.
2150,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,
2151,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,Among these various legends and tales I have selected one which is
2152,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,singular and striking. The great truth proclaimed under the thin
2153,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,guise of an eastern allegory is that a True Woman's Love is not
2154,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"conquered by Death. The story is known by Hindu women high and low,"
2155,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"rich and poor, in all parts of India; and on a certain night in the"
2156,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,year millions of Hindu women celebrate a rite in honour of the woman
2157,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"whose love was not conquered by death. Legends like these, though"
2158,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,"they take away from the unity and conciseness of the Epic, impart a"
2159,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,moral instruction to the millions of India the value of which cannot
2160,PATIVRATA-MAHATMYA,be overestimated.

2456,IV,"Served the old and sightless monarch like a daughter by his side,"
2457,IV,
2458,IV,"And with love and gentle sweetness pleased her husband and her lord,"
2459,IV,"But in secret, night and morning, pondered still on Narad's word!"
2460,IV,
2461,IV,"Nearer came the fatal morning by the holy Narad told,"
2462,IV,"Fair Savitri reckoned daily and her heart was still and cold,"
2463,IV,
2464,IV,Three short days remaining only! and she took a vow severe
2465,IV,"Of _triratra_, three nights' penance, holy fasts and vigils drear!"
2466,IV,
2467,IV,"Of Savitri's rigid penance heard the king with anxious woe,"
2468,IV,"Spake to her in loving accents, so the vow she might forgo:"
2469,IV,
2470,IV,"""Hard the penance, gentle daughter, and thy woman's limbs are frail,"
2471,IV,"After three nights' fasts and vigils sure thy tender health may fail!"""
2472,IV,
2473,IV,"""Be not anxious, loving father,"" meekly thus Savitri prayed,"
2474,IV,"""Penance I have undertaken, will unto the gods be made."""
2475,IV,
2476,IV,"Much misdoubting then the monarch gave his sad and slow assent,"
2477,IV,"Pale with fast and unseen tear-drops, lonesome nights Savitri spent."
2478,IV,
2479,IV,"Nearer came the fatal morning, and to-morrow he shall die,"
2480,IV,"Dark, dark hours of nightly silence! Tearless, sleepless is her eye!"
2481,IV,
2482,IV,"""Dawns that dread and fated morning!"" said Savitri, bloodless, brave,"
2483,IV,"Prayed her fervent prayers in silence, to the Fire oblations gave,"
2484,IV,
2485,IV,"Bowed unto the forest Brahmans, to the parents kind and good,"
2486,IV,Joined her hands in salutation and in reverent silence stood.
2487,IV,
2488,IV,"With the usual morning blessing, ""_Widow may'st thou never be_,"""
2489,IV,"Anchorites and agéd Brahmans blessed Savitri fervently,"
2490,IV,
2491,IV,"O! that blessing fell upon her like the rain on thirsty air,"
2492,IV,Struggling hope inspired her bosom as she drank those accents fair!
2493,IV,
2494,IV,"But returned the dark remembrance of the _rishi_ Narad's word,"
2495,IV,"Pale she watched the creeping sunbeams, mused upon her fated lord!"
2496,IV,
2497,IV,"""Daughter, now thy fast is over,"" so the loving parents said,"
2498,IV,"""Take thy diet after penance, for thy morning prayers are prayed,"""
2499,IV,
2500,IV,"""Pardon, father,"" said Savitri, ""let this other day be done,"""
2501,IV,"Unshed tear-drops filled her eyelids, glistened in the morning sun!"
2502,IV,
2503,IV,"Young Satyavan, tall and stately, ponderous axe on shoulder hung,"
2504,IV,"For the distant darksome jungle issued forth serene and strong,"
2505,IV,
2506,IV,"But unto him came Savitri and in sweetest accents prayed,"
2507,IV,As upon his manly bosom gently she her forehead laid:
2508,IV,
2509,IV,"""Long I wished to see the jungle where steals not the solar ray,"
2510,IV,"Take me to the darksome forest, husband, let me go to-day!"""
2511,IV,
2512,IV,"""Come not, love,"" he sweetly answered with a loving husband's care,"
2513,IV,"""Thou art all unused to labour, forest paths thou may'st not dare,"
2514,IV,
2515,IV,"And with recent fasts and vigils pale and bloodless is thy face,"
2516,IV,"And thy steps are weak and feeble, jungle paths thou may'st not trace."""
2517,IV,
2518,IV,"""Fasts and vigils make me stronger,"" said the wife with wifely pride,"
2519,IV,"""Toil I shall not feel nor languor when my lord is by my side,"
2520,IV,
2521,IV,"For I feel a woman's longing with my lord to trace the way,"
2522,IV,"Grant me, husband ever gracious, with thee let me go to-day!"""
2523,IV,
2524,IV,"Answered then the loving husband, as his hands in hers he wove,"
2525,IV,"""Ask permission from my parents in the trackless woods to rove."""
2526,IV,
2527,IV,"Then Savitri to the monarch urged her longing strange request,"
2528,IV,After duteous salutation thus her humble prayer addrest:
2529,IV,
2530,IV,"""To the jungle goes my husband, fuel and the fruit to seek,"
2531,IV,"I would follow if my mother and my loving father speak,"
2532,IV,
2533,IV,"Twelve-month from this narrow _asram_ hath Savitri stepped nor strayed,"
2534,IV,"In this cottage true and faithful ever hath Savitri stayed,"
2535,IV,
2536,IV,"For the sacrificial fuel wends my lord his lonesome way,"
2537,IV,"Please my kind and loving parents, I would follow him to-day."""
2538,IV,
2539,IV,"""Never since her wedding morning,"" so the loving king replied,"
2540,IV,"""Wish or thought Savitri whispered, for a boon or object sighed,"
2541,IV,
2542,IV,"Daughter, thy request is granted, safely in the forest roam,"
2543,IV,"Safely with thy lord and husband, seek again thy cottage home."""
2544,IV,
2545,IV,"Bowing to her loving parents did the fair Savitri part,"
2546,IV,"Smile upon her pallid features, anguish in her inmost heart!"
2547,IV,
2548,IV,"Round her sylvan green woods blossomed 'neath a cloudless Indian sky,"
2549,IV,"Flocks of pea-fowls gorgeous plumaged flew before her wondering eye,"
2550,IV,
2551,IV,"Woodland rills and crystal nullahs gently roll'd o'er rocky bed,"
2552,IV,"Flower-decked hills in dewy brightness towering glittered overhead,"
2553,IV,
2554,IV,"Birds of song and beauteous feather trilled a note in every grove,"
2555,IV,"Sweeter accents fell upon her, from her husband's lips of love!"
2556,IV,
2557,IV,"Still with thoughtful eye Savitri watched her dear and fated lord,"
2558,IV,"Flail of grief was in her bosom but her pale lips shaped no word,"
2559,IV,
2560,IV,"And she listened to her husband, still on anxious thought intent,"
2561,IV,"Cleft in two her throbbing bosom, as in silence still she went!"
2562,IV,
2563,IV,"Gaily with the gathered wild-fruits did the prince his basket fill,"
2564,IV,"Hewed the interlacéd branches with his might and practised skill,"
2565,IV,
2566,IV,"Till the drops stood on his forehead, weary was his aching head,"
2567,IV,Faint he came unto Savitri and in faltering accents said:
2568,IV,
2569,IV,"""Cruel ache is on my forehead, fond and ever faithful wife,"
2570,IV,"And I feel a hundred needles pierce me and torment my life,"
2571,IV,
2572,IV,"And my feeble footsteps falter, and my senses seem to reel,"
2573,IV,"Fain would I beside thee linger, for a sleep doth o'er me steal."""
2574,IV,
2575,IV,"With a wild and speechless terror pale Savitri held her lord,"
2576,IV,"On her lap his head she rested as she laid him on the sward,"
2577,IV,
2578,IV,"Narad's fatal words remembered as she watched her husband's head,"
2579,IV,"Burning lip and pallid forehead, and the dark and creeping shade,"
2580,IV,
2581,IV,"Clasped him in her beating bosom, kissed his lips with panting breath,"

2590,V,
2591,V,"Gleaming form of sable splendour, blood-red was his sparkling eye,"
2592,V,"And a fatal noose he carried, grim and godlike, dark and high!"
2593,V,
2594,V,"And he stood in solemn silence, looked in silence on the dead,"
2595,V,"And Savitri on the greensward gently placed her husband's head,"
2596,V,
2597,V,"And a tremor shook Savitri, but a woman's love is strong,"
2598,V,With her hands upon her bosom thus she spake with quivering tongue:
2599,V,
2600,V,"""More than mortal is thy glory, and a radiant god thou be,"
2601,V,"Tell me what bright name thou bearest, and thy message unto me."""

2614,V,
2615,V,"YAMA from Satyavan's body, pale and bloodless, cold and dumb,"

2617,V,
2618,V,"In his noose the spark he fastened, silent went his darksome way,"
2619,V,Left the body shorn of lustre to its rigid cold decay.
2620,V,
2621,V,"Southward went the dark-hued YAMA with the youth's immortal life,"
2622,V,"And, for woman's love abideth, followed still the faithful wife."
2623,V,
2624,V,"""Turn, Savitri,"" outspake YAMA, ""for thy husband loved and lost,"

2775,VI,"And with father's soft reproaches and with mother's loving fears,"
2776,VI,"Chid me for my tardy footsteps, dewed me with their gentle tears!"
2777,VI,
2778,VI,"Think then of my father's sorrow, of my mother's woeful plight,"

2787,VI,"""Trust me, husband, if Savitri hath been faithful in her love,"
2788,VI,"If she hath with pious offerings served the righteous gods above,"
2789,VI,
2790,VI,"If she hath a sister's kindness unto brother men performed,"
2791,VI,"If she hath in speech and action unto holy truth conformed,"
2792,VI,
2793,VI,"Unknown blessings, mighty gladness, trust thy ever faithful wife,"
2794,VI,"And not sorrows or disasters wait this eve our parents' life!"""
2795,VI,
2796,VI,"Then she rose and tied her tresses, gently helped her lord to rise,"
2797,VI,"Walked with him the pathless jungle, looked with love into his eyes,"

2800,VI,"Round his waist Savitri's right arm doth sweetly interlace,"
2801,VI,
2802,VI,"Thus they walked the darksome jungle, silent stars looked from above,"
2803,VI,And the hushed and throbbing midnight watched Savitri's deathless love.

2814,GO-HARANA,
2815,GO-HARANA,The conditions of the banishment of the sons of Pandu were hard. They
2816,GO-HARANA,"must pass twelve years in exile, and then they must remain a year in"
2817,GO-HARANA,"concealment. If they were discovered within this last year, they must"
2818,GO-HARANA,go into exile for another twelve years.
2819,GO-HARANA,
2820,GO-HARANA,"Having passed the twelve years of exile in forests, the Pandav"
2821,GO-HARANA,brothers disguised themselves and entered into the menial service
2822,GO-HARANA,"of Virata, king of the Matsyas, to pass the year of concealment."
2823,GO-HARANA,"Yudhishthir presented himself as a Brahman, skilled in dice, and"
2824,GO-HARANA,became a courtier of the king. Bhima entered the king's service
2825,GO-HARANA,"as cook. For Arjun, who was so well known, a stricter concealment"
2826,GO-HARANA,was necessary. He wore conch bangles and earrings and braided
2827,GO-HARANA,"his hair, like those unfortunate beings whom nature has debarred"
2828,GO-HARANA,"from the privileges of men and women, and he lived in the inner"
2829,GO-HARANA,"apartments of the king. He assumed the name of _Brihannala_, and"
2830,GO-HARANA,taught the inmates of the royal household in music and dancing.
2831,GO-HARANA,"Nakula became a keeper of the king's horses, and Sahadeva took"
2832,GO-HARANA,charge of the king's cows. Draupadi too disguised herself as a
2833,GO-HARANA,"waiting-woman, and served the princess of the Matsya house in that"
2834,GO-HARANA,humble capacity.
2835,GO-HARANA,
2836,GO-HARANA,In these disguises the Pandav brothers safely passed a year in
2837,GO-HARANA,concealment in spite of all search which Duryodhan made after them.
2838,GO-HARANA,At last an incident happened which led to their discovery when the
2839,GO-HARANA,year was out.
2840,GO-HARANA,
2841,GO-HARANA,"Cattle-lifting was a common practice with the kings of ancient India,"
2842,GO-HARANA,as with the chiefs of ancient Greece. The king of the Trigartas and
2843,GO-HARANA,the king of the Kurus combined and fell on the king of the Matsyas
2844,GO-HARANA,in order to drive off the numerous herd of fine cattle for which his
2845,GO-HARANA,kingdom was famed. The Trigartas entered the Matsya kingdom from
2846,GO-HARANA,"the south-east, and while Virata went out with his troops to meet"
2847,GO-HARANA,"the foe, Duryodhan with his Kuru forces fell on the kingdom from"
2848,GO-HARANA,the north.
2849,GO-HARANA,
2850,GO-HARANA,"When news came that the Kurus had invaded the kingdom, there was"
2851,GO-HARANA,no army in the capital to defend it. King Virata had gone out with
2852,GO-HARANA,"most of his troops to face the Trigartas in the south-east, and the"
2853,GO-HARANA,prince Uttara had no inclination to face the Kurus in the north. The
2854,GO-HARANA,disguised Arjun now came to the rescue in the manner described in
2855,GO-HARANA,"this Book. The description of the bows, arrows, and swords of the"
2856,GO-HARANA,"Pandav brothers which they had concealed in a tree, wrapped like"

2865,I,Complaint of the Cowherd
2866,I,
2867,I,"Monarch of the mighty Matsyas, brave Virata known to fame,"
2868,I,"Marched against Trigarta chieftains who from southward regions came,"
2869,I,
2870,I,"From the north the proud Duryodhan, stealing onwards day by day,"
2871,I,Swooped on Matsya's fattened cattle like the hawk upon its prey!
2872,I,
2873,I,"Bhishma, Drona, peerless Karna, led the Kuru warriors brave,"
2874,I,"Swept the kingdom of Virata like the ocean's surging wave,"
2875,I,
2876,I,"Fell upon the trembling cowherds, chased them from the pasture-field,"
2877,I,Sixty thousand head of cattle was the Matsya country's yield!
2878,I,
2879,I,"And the wailing chief of cowherds fled forlorn, fatigued and spent,"
2880,I,"Speeding on his rapid chariot to the royal city went,"
2881,I,
2882,I,"Came inside the city portals, came within the palace gate,"
2883,I,Struck his forehead in his anguish and bewailed his luckless fate.
2884,I,
2885,I,"Meeting there the prince Uttara, youth of beauty and of fame,"
2886,I,Told him of the Kurus' outrage and lamented Matsya's shame:
2887,I,
2888,I,"""Sixty thousand head of cattle, bred of Matsya's finest breed,"
2889,I,To Hastina's distant empire do the Kuru chieftains lead!
2890,I,
2891,I,"Glory of the Matsya nation! save thy father's valued kine,"
2892,I,"Quick thy footsteps, strong thy valour, vengeance deep and dire be thine!"
2893,I,
2894,I,"'Gainst the fierce Trigarta chieftains Matsya's warlike king is gone,"
2895,I,Thee we count our lord and saviour as our monarch's gallant son!
2896,I,
2897,I,"Rise, Uttara! beat the Kurus, homeward lead the stolen kine,"
2898,I,"Like an elephant of jungle, pierce the Kurus' shattered line!"
2899,I,
2900,I,"As the _Vina_ speaketh music, by musicians tuned aright,"
2901,I,Let thy sounding bow and arrows speak thy deeds of matchless might!
2902,I,
2903,I,"Harness quick thy milk-white coursers to thy sounding battle-car,"
2904,I,"Hoist thy golden lion-banner, speed thee, prince, unto the war!"
2905,I,
2906,I,"And as thunder-wielding INDRA smote _asuras_ fierce and bold,"
2907,I,Smite the Kurus with thy arrows winged with plumes of yellow gold!
2908,I,
2909,I,"As the famed and warlike Arjun is the stay of Kuru's race,"
2910,I,"Thou art refuge of the Matsyas and thy kingdom's pride and grace!"""
2911,I,
2912,I,"But the prince went not to battle from the foe to guard the State,"
2913,I,"To the cowherd answered gaily, sheltered by the palace gate:"
2914,I,
2915,I,"""Not unknown to me the usage of the bow and wingéd dart,"
2916,I,"Not unknown the warrior's duty or the warrior's noble art,"
2917,I,
2918,I,"I would win my father's cattle from the wily foeman's greed,"
2919,I,"If a skilful chariot-driver could my fiery coursers lead,"
2920,I,
2921,I,"For my ancient chariot-driver died on battle's gory plain,"
2922,I,"Eight and twenty days we wrestled, many warlike chiefs were slain!"
2923,I,
2924,I,"Bring me forth a skilful driver who can urge the battle-steed,"
2925,I,"I will hoist my lion-banner, to the dubious battle speed!"
2926,I,
2927,I,"Dashing through the foeman's horses, ranks of elephant and car,"
2928,I,I will win the stolen cattle rescued in the field of war!
2929,I,
2930,I,"And like thunder-wielding INDRA, smiting Danu's sons of old,"
2931,I,"I will smite the Kuru chieftains, drive them to their distant hold!"
2932,I,
2933,I,"Bhishma and the proud Duryodhan, archer Karna known to fame,"
2934,I,Drona too shall quail before me and retreat in bitter shame!
2935,I,
2936,I,Do those warriors in my absence Matsya's far-famed cattle steal?
2937,I,But beneath my countless arrows Matsya's vengeance they shall feel!
2938,I,
2939,I,"Bring me forth a chariot-driver, let me speed my battle-car,"
2940,I,"And in wonder they will question--Is this Arjun famed in war?"""

2944,II,The Disguised Charioteer
2945,II,
2946,II,"Arjun, guised as Brihannala, heard the boast Uttara made,"
2947,II,"And to try his skill and valour, thus to fair Draupadi prayed:"
2948,II,
2949,II,"""Say to him that Brihannala will his battle-chariot lead,"
2950,II,"That as Arjun's chariot-driver he hath learned to urge the steed,"
2951,II,
2952,II,"Say that faithful Brihannala many a dubious war hath seen,"
2953,II,"And will win his father's cattle in this contest fierce and keen."""
2954,II,
2955,II,"Fair Draupadi, guised as menial, Arjun's secret hest obeyed,"
2956,II,Humbly stepped before Uttara and in gentle accents prayed:
2957,II,
2958,II,"""Hear me, prince! yon Brihannala will thy battle-chariot lead,"
2959,II,"He was Arjun's chariot-driver, skilled to urge the flying steed,"
2960,II,
2961,II,"Trained in war by mighty Arjun, trained to drive the battle-car,"
2962,II,"He hath followed helméd Arjun in the glorious field of war,"
2963,II,
2964,II,"And when Arjun conquered Khandav, this, Uttara, I have seen,"
2965,II,"Brihannala drove his chariot, for I served Yudhishthir's queen."""
2966,II,
2967,II,"Heard Uttara hesitating, spake his faint and timid mind,"
2968,II,"""I would trust thee, beauteous maiden, lotus-bosomed, ever kind,"
2969,II,
2970,II,"But a poor and sexless creature, can he rein the warlike steed?"
2971,II,"Can I ask him, worse than woman, in the battle's ranks to lead?"""
2972,II,
2973,II,"""Need is none,"" Draupadi answered, ""Brihannala's grace to ask,"
2974,II,He is eager like the war-horse for this great and warlike task!
2975,II,
2976,II,"And he waits upon thy sister, she will bid the minion speed,"
2977,II,"And he wins thy father's cattle, and the victor's glorious meed!"""
2978,II,
2979,II,"Matsya's princess spake to Arjun, Arjun led the battle-car,"
2980,II,Led the doubting prince Uttara to the dread and dubious war!

2983,III,
2984,III,Arms and Weapons
2985,III,
2986,III,"Arjun drove the prince of Matsya to a darksome _sami_ tree,"
2987,III,Spake unto the timid warrior in his accents bold and free:
2988,III,
2989,III,"""Prince, thy bow and shining arrows, pretty handsome toys are these,"
2990,III,"Scarcely they beseem a warrior, and a warrior cannot please!"
2991,III,
2992,III,"Thou shalt find upon this _sami_, mark my words which never fail,"
2993,III,"Stately bows and wingéd arrows, banners, swords and coats of mail!"
2994,III,
2995,III,"And a bow which strongest warriors scarce can in the battle bend,"
2996,III,And the limits of a kingdom widen when that bow is strained!
2997,III,
2998,III,"Tall and slender like a palm-tree, worthy of a warrior bold,"
2999,III,"Smooth the wood of hardened fibre, and the ends are yellow gold!"""
3000,III,
3001,III,"Doubting still Uttara answered: ""In this _sami's_ gloomy shade"
3002,III,"Corpses hang since many seasons, in their wrappings duly laid,"
3003,III,
3004,III,"Now I mark them all suspended, horrent, in the open air,"
3005,III,"And to touch the unclean objects, friend, is more than I can dare!"""
3006,III,
3007,III,"""Fear not warrior,"" Arjun answered, ""for the tree conceals no dead,"
3008,III,"Warriors' weapons, cased like corpses, lurk within its gloomy shade,"
3009,III,
3010,III,"And I ask thee, prince of Matsya, not to touch an unclean thing,"
3011,III,"But unto a chief and warrior weapons and his arms to bring!"""
3012,III,
3013,III,"Prince Uttara gently lighted, climbed the dark and leafy tree,"
3014,III,"Arjun from the prince's chariot bade him speed the arms to free,"
3015,III,
3016,III,Then the young prince cut the wrappings and the shining bows appear
3017,III,"Twisted, voiced like hissing serpents, like the bright stars glistening"
3018,III,clear!
3019,III,
3020,III,"Seized with wonder prince Uttara silently the weapons eyed,"
3021,III,And unto his chariot-driver thus in trembling accents cried:
3022,III,
3023,III,"""Whose this bow so tall and stately, speak to me my gentle friend,"
3024,III,"On the wood are golden bosses, tipped with gold at either end?"
3025,III,
3026,III,"Whose this second ponderous weapon stout and massive in the hold,"
3027,III,On the staff are worked by artists elephants of burnished gold?
3028,III,
3029,III,"Sure some great and mighty monarch owns this other bow of might,"
3030,III,Set with golden glittering insects on its ebon back so bright?
3031,III,
3032,III,"Golden suns of wondrous brightness on this fourth their lustre lend,"
3033,III,Who may be the unknown archer who this stately bow can bend?
3034,III,
3035,III,"And the fifth is set with jewels, gems and stones of purest ray,"
3036,III,Golden fire-flies glint and sparkle in the yellow light of day!
3037,III,
3038,III,"Who doth own these shining arrows with their heads in gold encased,"
3039,III,"Thousand arrows bright and feathered, in the golden quivers placed?"
3040,III,
3041,III,"Next are these with vulture-feather, golden-yellow in their hue,"
3042,III,"Made of iron, keen and whetted, whose may be these arrows true?"
3043,III,
3044,III,"Next upon this sable quiver jungle tigers worked in gold,"
3045,III,And these keen and boar-eared arrows speak some chieftains fierce and bold!
3046,III,
3047,III,"Fourth are these seven hundred arrows, crescent is their shining blade,"
3048,III,"Thirsting for the blood of foemen, and by cunning artists made!"
3049,III,
3050,III,"And the fifth are golden-crested, made of tempered steel and bright,"
3051,III,"Parrot feathers wing these arrows, whetted and of wondrous might!"
3052,III,
3053,III,"Who doth own this wondrous sabre, shape of toad is on the hilt,"
3054,III,"On the blade a toad is graven, and the scabbard nobly gilt?"
3055,III,
3056,III,"Larger, stouter is this second in its sheath of tiger-skin,"
3057,III,"Decked with bells and gold-surmounted, and the blade is bright and keen!"
3058,III,
3059,III,"Next this scimitar so curious by the skilled _nishadas_ made,"
3060,III,Scabbard made of wondrous cowhide sheathes the bright and polished blade!
3061,III,
3062,III,"Fourth, a long and beauteous weapon glittering sable in its hue,"
3063,III,With its sheath of softer goat-skin worked with gold on azure blue!
3064,III,
3065,III,"And the fifth is broad and massive over thirty fingers long,"
3066,III,"Golden-sheathed and gold embosséd like a snake or fiery tongue!"""
3067,III,
3068,III,"Joyously responded Arjun: ""Mark this bow embossed with gold,"
3069,III,"'Tis the wondrous bow, _gandiva_, worthy of a warrior bold!"
3070,III,
3071,III,"Gift of heaven! to archer Arjun kindly gods this weapon sent,"
3072,III,And the confines of a kingdom widen when the bow is bent!
3073,III,
3074,III,"Next, this mighty ponderous weapon worked with elephants of gold,"
3075,III,With this bow the stalwart Bhima hath the tide of conquests rolled!

3088,III,
3089,III,"These three-knotted shining arrows, thick and yellow vulture-plumed,"
3090,III,"They belong to King Yudhishthir, with their heads by gold illumed."

3113,III,"O'er a game they lost their empire, and we heard of them no more,"
3114,III,Or perchance they lonesome wander on some wild and distant shore!

3137,IV,
3138,IV,"And the Kurus marked with wonder Arjun's standard lifted proud,"
3139,IV,Heard with dread the deep _gandiva_ sounding oft and sounding loud!
3140,IV,
3141,IV,"And they knew the wondrous bowman wheeling round the battle-car,"
3142,IV,And with doubts and grave misgivings whispered Drona skilled in war:
3143,IV,
3144,IV,"""That is Arjun's monkey-standard, how it greets my ancient eyes!"

3156,IV,"Well I know his bow and arrows and I know his standard well,"
3157,IV,And the deep and echoing accents of his far-resounding shell!
3158,IV,
3159,IV,"In his shining arms accoutred, gleaming in his helmet dread,"
3160,IV,"Shines he like the flame of _homa_ by libations duly fed!"""
3161,IV,
3162,IV,"Arjun marked the Kuru warriors arming for th' impending war,"
3163,IV,Whispered thus to prince Uttara as he drove the battle-car:
3164,IV,
3165,IV,"""Stop thy steeds, O prince of Matsya! for too close we may not go,"

3179,IV,
3180,IV,"But I leave these car-borne warriors, other work to-day is mine,"
3181,IV,"Meet Duryodhan in the battle, win thy father's stolen kine!"""
3182,IV,
3183,IV,"Matsya's prince then turned the courses, left behind the war's array,"
3184,IV,"Where Duryodhan with the cattle quickly held his onward way,"
3185,IV,
3186,IV,"Kripa marked the course of Arjun, guessed his inmost thought aright,"
3187,IV,Thus he spake to brother warriors urging speed and instant fight:

3196,IV,"If our monarch sinks in battle like a ship in stormy sea!"""
3197,IV,

3336,UDYOGA,"The term of banishment having expired, Yudhishthir demanded that"
3337,UDYOGA,the kingdom of Indra-prastha should be restored to him. The old
3338,UDYOGA,Dhrita-rashtra and his queen and the aged and virtuous councillors
3339,UDYOGA,"advised the restoration, but, the jealous Duryodhan hated his cousins"
3340,UDYOGA,"with a genuine hatred, and would not cement. All negotiations were"

3353,I,"Youthful bosoms throbbed with pleasure, love-lit glances sparkled bright,"
3354,I,
3355,I,"But when young and white-robed USHAS ope'd the golden gates of day,"
3356,I,To Virata's council chamber chieftains thoughtful held their way.
3357,I,
3358,I,"Stones inlaid in arch and pillar glinted in the glittering dawn,"
3359,I,Gay festoons and graceful garlands o'er the golden cushions shone!
3360,I,
3361,I,"Matsya's king, Panchala's monarch, foremost seats of honour claim,"
3362,I,"Krishna too and Valadeva, Dwarka's chiefs of righteous fame!"

3369,I,
3370,I,"In their gem-bespangled garments came the warriors proud and high,"

3372,I,
3373,I,"Kind the greetings, sweet the converse, soft the golden moments fly,"
3374,I,"Till intent on graver questions all on Krishna turn their eye,"
3375,I,
3376,I,"Krishna with his inner vision then the state of things surveyed,"
3377,I,And his thoughts before the monarchs thus in weighty accents laid:
3378,I,
3379,I,"""Known to all, ye mighty monarchs! May your glory ever last!"
3380,I,"True to plighted word Yudhishthir hath his weary exile passed,"
3381,I,
3382,I,"Twelve long years with fair Draupadi in the pathless jungle strayed,"
3383,I,"And a year in menial service in Virata's palace stayed,"
3384,I,
3385,I,"He hath kept his plighted promise, braved affliction, woe and shame,"
3386,I,"And he begs, assembled monarchs, ye shall now his duty name!"
3387,I,
3388,I,"For he swerveth not from duty kingdom of the sky to win,"
3389,I,"Prizeth hamlet more than empire, so his course be free from sin,"
3390,I,
3391,I,"Loss of realm and wealth and glory higher virtues in him prove,"
3392,I,Thoughts of peace and not of anger still the good Yudhishthir move!
3393,I,
3394,I,Mark again the sleepless anger and the unrelenting hate
3395,I,"Harboured by the proud Duryodhan driven by his luckless fate,"
3396,I,
3397,I,"From a child, by fire or poison, impious guile or trick of dice,"
3398,I,"He hath compassed dark destruction, by deceit and low device!"
3399,I,
3400,I,"Ponder well, ye gracious monarchs, with a just and righteous mind,"
3401,I,"Help Yudhishthir with your counsel, with your grace and blessings kind,"
3402,I,
3403,I,"Should the noble son of Pandu seek his right by open war,"

3407,I,"Unforgiving in their vengeance, unrelenting in their heart?"
3408,I,
3409,I,"Should he rather send a message to the proud unbending foe,"
3410,I,And Duryodhan's haughty purpose seek by messenger to know?
3411,I,
3412,I,"Should he send a noble envoy, trained in virtue, true and wise,"
3413,I,With his greetings to Duryodhan in a meek and friendly guise?
3414,I,
3415,I,Ask him to restore the kingdom on the sacred Jumna's shore?
3416,I,"Either king may rule his empire as in happy days of yore!"""
3417,I,

3427,II,
3428,II,"""Ye have listened, pious monarchs, to my brother's gentle word,"
3429,II,"Love he bears to good Yudhishthir and to proud Hastina's lord,"
3430,II,
3431,II,"For his realm by dark blue Jumna good Yudhishthir held of yore,"
3432,II,"Brave Duryodhan ruled his kingdom on the ruddy Ganga's shore,"
3433,II,
3434,II,"And once more in love and friendship either prince may rule his share,"

3448,II,
3449,II,"Speak he not in futile anger, for Duryodhan holds the power,"
3450,II,And Yudhishthir's wrath were folly in this sad and luckless hour!
3451,II,
3452,II,"By his dearest friends dissuaded, but by rage or madness driven,"
3453,II,"He hath played and lost his empire, may his folly be forgiven!"
3454,II,
3455,II,"Indra-prastha's spacious empire now Duryodhan deems his own,"
3456,II,"By his tears and soft entreaty let Yudhishthir seek the throne,"
3457,II,
3458,II,"Open war I do not counsel, humbly seek Duryodhan's grace,"

3470,III,
3471,III,"Oft from warlike stock ariseth weakling chief who bends the knee,"
3472,III,As a withered fruitless sapling springeth from a fruitful tree!
3473,III,
3474,III,"From a heart so faint and craven, faint and craven words must flow,"
3475,III,Monarchs in their pride and glory list not to such counsel low!
3476,III,
3477,III,"Could'st thou, impious Valadeva, midst these potentates of fame,"
3478,III,On Yudhishthir pious-hearted cast this undeservéd blame?
3479,III,
3480,III,"Challenged by his wily foeman and by dark misfortune crost,"
3481,III,Trusting to their faith Yudhishthir played a righteous game and lost!
3482,III,
3483,III,"Challenge from a crownéd monarch can a crownéd king decline,"
3484,III,Can a Kshatra warrior fathom fraud in sons of royal line?
3485,III,
3486,III,"Nathless he surrendered empire true to faith and plighted word,"
3487,III,Lived for years in pathless forests Indra-prastha's mighty lord!
3488,III,
3489,III,"Past his years of weary exile, now he claims his realm of old,"
3490,III,"Claims it, not as humble suppliant, but as king and warrior bold!"
3491,III,
3492,III,"Past his year of dark concealment, bold Yudhishthir claims his own,"
3493,III,Proud Duryodhan now must render Indra-prastha's jewelled throne!

3497,III,
3498,III,"Open war I therefore counsel, ruthless and relentless war,"
3499,III,Grace we seek not when we meet them speeding in our battle-car!
3500,III,
3501,III,"And our weapons, not entreaties, shall our foemen force to yield,"
3502,III,Yield Yudhishthir's rightful kingdom or they perish on the field!
3503,III,
3504,III,"False Duryodhan and his forces fall beneath our battle's shock,"

3526,III,Place the exile pious-hearted on his father's ancient throne!
3527,III,
3528,III,"And no sin Satyaki reckons slaughter of the mortal foe,"
3529,III,But to beg a grace of foemen were a mortal sin and woe!

3552,IV,
3553,IV,"In his pride he deems our mildness faint and feeble-hearted fear,"
3554,IV,And our suit will fan his glory and his arrogance will cheer!

3598,V,Ill beseems that sin or untruth should thy ancient bosom soil!
3599,V,
3600,V,"For thy sons in impious anger seek to do their kinsmen wrong,"
3601,V,"And withhold the throne and kingdom which by right to them belong,"
3602,V,
3603,V,"And a danger thus ariseth like the comet's baleful fire,"

3894,BHISHMA-BADHA,All negotiations for a peaceful partition of the Kuru kingdom having
3895,BHISHMA-BADHA,"failed, both parties now prepared for a battle, perhaps the most"
3896,BHISHMA-BADHA,sanguinary that was fought on the plains of India in the ancient
3897,BHISHMA-BADHA,"times. It was a battle of nations, for all warlike races in Northern"
3898,BHISHMA-BADHA,India took a share in it.
3899,BHISHMA-BADHA,
3900,BHISHMA-BADHA,"Duryodhan's army consisted of his own division, as well as the"
3901,BHISHMA-BADHA,divisions of ten allied kings. Each allied power is said to have
3902,BHISHMA-BADHA,"brought one _akshauhini_ troops, and if we reduce this fabulous"
3903,BHISHMA-BADHA,"number to the moderate figure of ten thousand, including horse and"
3904,BHISHMA-BADHA,"foot, cars and elephants, Duryodhan's army including his own division"
3905,BHISHMA-BADHA,was over a hundred thousand strong.
3906,BHISHMA-BADHA,
3907,BHISHMA-BADHA,"Yudhishthir had a smaller army, said to have been seven _akshauhinis_"
3908,BHISHMA-BADHA,"in number, which we may by a similar reduction reckon to be seventy"
3909,BHISHMA-BADHA,"thousand. His father-in-law the king of the Panchalas, and Arjun's"
3910,BHISHMA-BADHA,"relative the king of the Matsyas, were his principal allies. Krishna"
3911,BHISHMA-BADHA,"joined him as his friend and adviser, and as the charioteer of Arjun,"
3912,BHISHMA-BADHA,but the Vrishnis as a nation had joined Duryodhan.
3913,BHISHMA-BADHA,
3914,BHISHMA-BADHA,"When the two armies were drawn up in array and faced each other, and"
3915,BHISHMA-BADHA,Arjun saw his revered elders and dear friends and relations among his
3916,BHISHMA-BADHA,"foes, he was unwilling to fight. It was on this occasion that Krishna"
3917,BHISHMA-BADHA,explained to him the great principles of Duty in that memorable work
3918,BHISHMA-BADHA,called the _Bhagavat-gita_ which has been translated into so many
3919,BHISHMA-BADHA,European languages. Belief in one Supreme Deity is the underlying
3920,BHISHMA-BADHA,"thought of this work, and ever and anon, as Professor Garbe remarks,"
3921,BHISHMA-BADHA,"""does Krishna revert to the doctrine that for every man, no matter to"

3925,BHISHMA-BADHA,Duryodhan chose the grand old fighter Bhishma as the

4094,II,"Safely sat the eastern monarch on his _howda's_ lofty seat,"
4095,II,"Till upon the giant tusker Bhima sprang with agile feet,"
4096,II,
4097,II,"Then he struck with fatal fury, brave Kalinga fell in twain,"
4098,II,"Scattered fled his countless forces, when they saw their leader slain!"
4099,II,
4100,II,Darkly rolled the tide of battle where Duryodhan's valiant son
4101,II,"Strove against the son of Arjun famed for deeds of valour done,"
4102,II,
4103,II,"Proud Duryodhan marked the contest with a father's anxious heart,"
4104,II,"Came to save his gallant Lakshman from brave Abhimanyu's dart,"
4105,II,
4106,II,"And the helmet-wearing Arjun marked his son among his foes,"
4107,II,Wheeled from far his battle-chariot and in wrath terrific rose!
4108,II,
4109,II,"""Arjun!"" ""Arjun!"" cried the Kurus, and in panic broke and fled,"
4110,II,"Steed and tusker turned from battle, soldiers fell among the dead!"
4111,II,
4112,II,"Godlike Krishna drove the coursers of resistless Arjun's car,"
4113,II,And the sound of Arjun's _sankha_ rose above the cry of war!
4114,II,
4115,II,"And the voice of his _gandiva_ spread a terror far and near,"
4116,II,"Crushed and broken, faint and frightened, fled the Kurus in their fear!"
4117,II,
4118,II,"Onward still through scattered foemen conquering Arjun held his way,"
4119,II,Till the evening's gathering darkness closed the action of the day!

4123,III,Bhishma and Arjun meet
4124,III,
4125,III,"Anxious was the proud Duryodhan when the golden morning came,"
4126,III,"For before the car of Arjun fled each Kuru chief of fame,"
4127,III,
4128,III,"Brave Duryodhan shook in anger and a tremor moved his frame,"
4129,III,As he spake to ancient Bhishma words of wrath in bitter shame:
4130,III,
4131,III,"""Bhishma! dost thou lead the Kurus in this battle's crimson field?"
4132,III,"Warlike Drona, doth he guard us like a broad and ample shield?"
4133,III,
4134,III,Wherefore then before yon Arjun do the valiant Kurus fly?
4135,III,Wherefore doth our leader linger when he hears the battle cry?
4136,III,
4137,III,Doth a secret love for Pandavs quell our leader's matchless might?
4138,III,With a halting zeal for Kurus doth the noble Bhishma fight?
4139,III,
4140,III,"Pardon, chief! if for the Pandavs doth thy partial heart incline,"
4141,III,"Yield thy place! let faithful Karna lead my gallant Kuru line!"""
4142,III,
4143,III,"Anger flamed on Bhishma's forehead and the tear was in his eye,"
4144,III,And in accents few and trembling thus the warrior made reply:
4145,III,
4146,III,"""Vain our toil, unwise Duryodhan! Nor can Bhishma warrior old,"
4147,III,"Nor can Drona skilled in weapons, Karna archer proud and bold,"
4148,III,
4149,III,"Wash the stain of deeds unholy and of wrongs and outraged laws,"
4150,III,Conquer with a load of cunning 'gainst a right and righteous cause!
4151,III,
4152,III,"Deaf to wisdom's voice, Duryodhan! deaf to parents and to kin,"
4153,III,"Thou shalt perish in thy folly, in thy unrepented sin!"
4154,III,
4155,III,"For the wrongs and insults offered unto good Yudhishthir's wife,"
4156,III,"For the kingdom from him stolen, for the plots against his life,"
4157,III,
4158,III,"For the dreadful oath of Bhima, for the holy counsel given,"
4159,III,"Vainly given by saintly Krishna, thou art doomed by righteous Heaven!"
4160,III,
4161,III,"Meanwhile since he leads thy forces, Bhishma still shall meet his foe,"
4162,III,"Or to conquer, or to perish, to the battle's front I go."""
4163,III,
4164,III,"Speaking thus, unto the battle ancient Bhishma held his way,"
4165,III,"Sweeping all before his chariot as upon a previous day,"
4166,III,
4167,III,"And the army of Yudhishthir shook from end to farthest end,"
4168,III,Arjun nor the valiant Krishna could against the tide contend!
4169,III,
4170,III,"Cars were shattered, fled the coursers, elephants were pierced and slain,"
4171,III,"Shafts of chariots, broken standards, lifeless soldiers strewed the plain!"
4172,III,
4173,III,"Coats of mail were left by warriors as they ran with streaming hair,"
4174,III,Soldiers fled like herds of cattle stricken by a sudden fear!
4175,III,
4176,III,"Krishna, Arjun's chariot-driver, and a chief of righteous fame,"
4177,III,"Marked the broken Pandav forces, spake in grief and bitter shame:"
4178,III,
4179,III,"""Arjun! not in hour of battle hath it been they wont to fly,"
4180,III,"Forward lay thy path of glory, or to conquer or to die!"
4181,III,
4182,III,"If to-day with angry Bhishma Arjun shuns the dubious fight,"
4183,III,Shame on Krishna! if he joins thee in this sad inglorious flight!
4184,III,
4185,III,"Be it mine alone, O Arjun! warrior's wonted work to know,"
4186,III,"Krishna with his fiery discus smites the all-resistless foe!"""
4187,III,
4188,III,"Then he flung the reins to Arjun, left the steeds and sounding car,"
4189,III,"Leaped upon the field of battle, rushed into the dreadful war!"
4190,III,
4191,III,"""Shame!"" cried Arjun in his anger, ""Krishna shall not wage the fight,"
4192,III,"Nor shall Arjun like a recreant seek for safety in his flight!"""
4193,III,
4194,III,"And he dashed behind the warrior, and on foot the chief pursued,"
4195,III,"Caught him as the angry Krishna still his distant foeman viewed,"
4196,III,
4197,III,"Stalwart Arjun lifted Krishna, as the storm lifts up a tree,"
4198,III,"Placed him on his battle-chariot, and he bent to him his knee:"
4199,III,
4200,III,"""Pardon, Krishna, this compulsion! pardon this transgression bold,"
4201,III,"But while Arjun lives, O chieftain! weapon of thy wrath withhold!"
4202,III,
4203,III,"By my warlike Abhimanyu, fair Subhadra's darling boy,"
4204,III,"By my brothers, dearer, truer, than in hours of pride and joy,"
4205,III,
4206,III,"By my troth I pledge thee, Krishna,--let thy angry discus sleep,--"
4207,III,"Archer Arjun meets his foeman, and his plighted word will keep."""
4208,III,
4209,III,"Forthwith rushed the fiery Arjun in his sounding battle-car,"
4210,III,"And like waves before him parted serried ranks of hostile war,"
4211,III,
4212,III,"Vainly hurled his lance Duryodhan 'gainst the valiant warrior's face,"
4213,III,"Vainly Salya, king of Madra, threw with skill his pond'rous mace,"
4214,III,
4215,III,"With disdain the godlike Arjun dashed the feeble darts aside,"
4216,III,"Hold aloft his famed _gandiva_ as he stood with haughty pride,"
4217,III,
4218,III,"Beat of drum and blare of _sankha_ and the thunder of his car,"
4219,III,And his weapon's fearful accents rose terrific near and far!
4220,III,
4221,III,"Came resistless Pandav forces, sweeping onward wave on wave,"
4222,III,"Chedis, Matsyas, and Panchalas, chieftains true and warriors brave!"
4223,III,
4224,III,"Onward too came forth the Kurus, by the matchless Bhishma led,"
4225,III,Shouts arose and cry of anguish midst the dying and the dead!
4226,III,
4227,III,"But the evening closed in darkness, and the night-fires fitful flared,"

4239,IV,
4240,IV,"Smote Duryodhan with his arrows, three terrific darts and five,"
4241,IV,Smote proud Salya; from the battle scarce they bore the chiefs alive!
4242,IV,
4243,IV,"Then Duryodhan's fourteen brothers rushed into the dreadful fray,"
4244,IV,"Fatal was the luckless moment, inauspicious was the day!"
4245,IV,
4246,IV,"Licked his mouth the vengeful Bhima, and he shook his bow and lance,"

4510,X,"Proud Duryodhan marked their onset, and its fatal purpose knew,"
4511,X,"And his bravest men and chieftains 'gainst the fiery Pandavs threw,"
4512,X,
4513,X,"With Kamboja's stalwart monarch and with Drona's mighty son,"
4514,X,With the valiant bowman Kripa stemmed the battle still unwon!
4515,X,
4516,X,"And his younger, fierce Duhsasan, thirsting for the deathful war,"
4517,X,"'Gainst the helmet-wearing Arjun drew his mighty battle-car,"
4518,X,
4519,X,"As the high and rugged mountain meets the angry ocean's sway,"
4520,X,"Proud Duhsasan warred with Arjun in his wild and onward way,"
4521,X,
4522,X,"And as myriad white-winged sea-birds swoop upon the darksome wave,"
4523,X,Clouds of darts and glistening lances drank the red blood of the brave!
4524,X,
4525,X,"Other warlike Kuru chieftains came, the bravest and the best,"
4526,X,"Drona's self and Bhagadatta, monarch of the farthest East,"
4527,X,
4528,X,"Car-borne Salya, mighty warrior, king of Madra's distant land,"
4529,X,"Princes from Avanti's regions, chiefs from Malav's rocky strand,"
4530,X,
4531,X,"Jayadratha, matchless fighter, king of Sindhu's sounding shore,"
4532,X,"Chetrasena and Vikarna, countless chiefs and warriors more!"
4533,X,
4534,X,"And they faced the fiery Pandavs, peerless in their warlike might,"
4535,X,"Long and dreadful raged the combat, darkly closed the dubious fight,"
4536,X,
4537,X,"Dust arose like clouds of summer, glistening darts like lightning played,"
4538,X,"Darksome grew the sky with arrows, thicker grew the gloomy shade,"
4539,X,
4540,X,"Cars went down and mailéd horsemen, soldiers fell in dread array,"
4541,X,Elephants with white tusks broken and with mangled bodies lay!
4542,X,
4543,X,"Arjun and the stalwart Bhima, piercing through their countless foes,"
4544,X,"Side by side impelled their chariots, where the palm-tree standard rose!"
4545,X,
4546,X,"Where the peerless ancient Bhishma on that dark and fatal day,"
4547,X,"Warring with the banded nations, still resistless held his way!"
4548,X,
4549,X,"On he came, his palm-tree standard still the front of battle knew,"
4550,X,And like sun from dark clouds parting Bhishma burst on Arjun's view!
4551,X,
4552,X,"And his eyes brave Arjun shaded at the awe-inspiring sight,"
4553,X,Half he wished to turn for shelter from that chief of godlike might!
4554,X,
4555,X,"But bold Krishna drove his chariot, whispered unto him his plan,"
4556,X,Arjun placed the young Sikhandin in the deathful battle's van!
4557,X,
4558,X,"Bhishma viewed the Pandav forces with a calm unmoving face,"
4559,X,"Saw not Arjun's fair _gandiva_, saw not Bhima's mighty mace,"
4560,X,
4561,X,"Smiled to see the young Sikhandin rushing to the battle's fore,"
4562,X,Like the foam upon the billow when the mighty storm-winds roar!
4563,X,
4564,X,"Bhishma thought of word he plighted and of oath that he had sworn,"
4565,X,Dropped his arms before the warrior who was but a female born!
4566,X,
4567,X,"And the standard which no warrior ever saw in base retreat,"
4568,X,"Idly stood upon the chariot, threw its shade on Bhishma's seat!"
4569,X,
4570,X,"And the flagstaff fell dissevered on the crushed and broken car,"
4571,X,As from azure sky of midnight falls the meteor's flaming star!
4572,X,
4573,X,"Not by young Sikhandin's arrows Bhishma's palm-tree standard fell,"
4574,X,"Not Sikhandin's feeble lances did the peerless Bhishma quell,"
4575,X,
4576,X,"True to oath the bleeding chieftan turned his darkening face away,"
4577,X,Turned and fell; the sun declining marked the closing of the day.
4578,X,
4579,X,"Ended thus the fatal battle, truce came with the close of day,"
4580,X,"Kurus and the silent Pandavs went where Bhishma dying lay,"
4581,X,
4582,X,"Arjun wept as for a father weeps a sad and sorrowing son,"
4583,X,"Good Yudhishthir cursed the morning Kuru-kshetra's war begun,"
4584,X,
4585,X,"Stood Duryodhan and his brothers mantled in the gloom of grief,"
4586,X,Foes like loving brothers sorrowed round the great the dying chief!
4587,X,
4588,X,"Arjun's keen and pointed arrows made the hero's dying bed,"
4589,X,And in soft and gentle accents to Duryodhan thus he said:
4590,X,
4591,X,"""List unto my words, Duryodhan, uttered with my latest breath,"
4592,X,List to Bhishma's dying counsel and revere the voice of death!
4593,X,
4594,X,"End this dread and deathful battle if thy stony heart can grieve,"
4595,X,"Save the chieftains doomed to slaughter, bid the fated nations live!"
4596,X,
4597,X,"Grant his kingdom to Yudhishthir, righteous man beloved of Heaven,"
4598,X,"Keep thy own Hastina's regions, be the hapless past forgiven!"""
4599,X,
4600,X,"Vain, alas! the voice of Bhishma like the voice of angel spoke,"
4601,X,Hatred dearer than his life-blood in the proud Duryodhan woke!
4602,X,
4603,X,"Darker grew the gloomy midnight, and the princes went their way,"
4604,X,"On his bed of pointed arrows Bhishma lone and dying lay,"
4605,X,
4606,X,"Karna, though he loved not Bhishma whilst the chieftain lived in fame,"
4607,X,Gently to the dying Bhishma in the midnight darkness came!
4608,X,
4609,X,"Bhishma heard the tread of Karna, and he oped his glazing eye,"
4610,X,"Spake in love and spake in sadness, and his bosom heaved a sigh:"
4611,X,
4612,X,"""Pride and envy, noble Karna, filled our warlike hearts with strife,"
4613,X,"Discord ends with breath departing, envy sinks with fleeting life!"
4614,X,
4615,X,"More I have to tell thee, Karna, but my parting breath may fail,"
4616,X,"Feeble are my dying accents, and my parchéd lips are pale!"
4617,X,
4618,X,"Arjun beats not noble Karna in the deeds of valour done,"
4619,X,"Nor excels in birth and lineage, Karna, thou art Pritha's son!"
4620,X,
4621,X,"Pritha bore thee, still unwedded, and the Sun inspired thy birth,"
4622,X,God-born man! No mightier archer treads this broad and spacious earth!
4623,X,
4624,X,"Pritha cast thee in her sorrow, hid thee with a maiden's shame,"
4625,X,"And a driver, not thy father, nursed thee, chief of warlike fame!"
4626,X,
4627,X,"Arjun is thy brother, Karna, end this sad fraternal war,"
4628,X,"Seek not life-blood of thy brother, nor against him drive thy car!"""
4629,X,
4630,X,"Vain, alas! the voice of Bhishma like a heavenly warning spoke,"
4631,X,Hatred dearer than his life-blood in the vengeful Karna woke!

4657,I,Single Combat between Bhima and Salya
4658,I,
4659,I,Morning ushered in the battle; Pandav warriors heard with dread
4660,I,"Drona priest and proud preceptor now the Kuru forces led,"
4661,I,
4662,I,"And the foe-compelling Drona pledged his troth and solemn word,"
4663,I,He would take Yudhishthir captive to Hastina's haughty lord!
4664,I,
4665,I,"But the ever faithful Arjun to his virtuous elder bowed,"
4666,I,And in clear and manful accents spake his warlike thoughts aloud:
4667,I,
4668,I,"""Sacred is our great preceptor, sacred is _acharya's_ life,"
4669,I,Arjun may not slay his teacher even in this mortal strife!

4676,I,
4677,I,"Morning witnessed doughty Drona foremost in the battle's tide,"
4678,I,"But Yudhishthir's warlike chieftains compassed him on every side,"
4679,I,
4680,I,"Foremost of the youthful chieftains came resistless Arjun's son,--"
4681,I,"Father's blood and milk of mother fired his deeds of valour done,"
4682,I,
4683,I,"As the lion of the jungle drags the ox into his lair,"

4688,I,

4691,I,
4692,I,"Rank to rank from both the forces cry of admiration rose,"
4693,I,"Streaming men poured forth in wonder, watched the combat fierce and close!"
4694,I,

4703,I,
4704,I,"Stoutest wrestlers in the armies, peerless fighters with the mace,"
4705,I,Bhima and the stalwart Salya stood opposéd face to face!

4715,I,
4716,I,Loud as INDRA'S peals of thunder still their blows were echoed round
4717,I,Rank to rank the startled soldiers heard the oft-repeated sound!
4718,I,
4719,I,"But as strikes in vain the lightning on the solid mountain-rock,"
4720,I,Bhima nor the fearless Salya fell or moved beneath the shock!
4721,I,
4722,I,"Closer drew the watchful heroes, and their clubs were wielded well,"
4723,I,Till by many blows belaboured both the fainting fighters fell!

4754,II,"Arjun fought the Sam-saptakas in the battle-field afar,"
4755,II,
4756,II,"But the prince of fair Panchala marked his father's ancient foe,"
4757,II,"And against the doughty Drona, Dhrishta-dyumna bent his bow!"
4758,II,
4759,II,"But as darksome cloudy masses angry gusts of storm divide,"
4760,II,"Through the scattered fainting foemen Drona drove his car in pride,"
4761,II,
4762,II,"Steeds went down and riven chariots, young Panchala turned and fled,"
4763,II,Onward drove resistless Drona o'er the dying and the dead!
4764,II,
4765,II,"One more prince of fair Panchala 'gainst the mighty Drona came,--"
4766,II,"Ancient feud ran in the red blood of Panchala's chiefs of fame,--"
4767,II,
4768,II,"Fated youth! with reckless valour still he fought his father's foe,"
4769,II,Fought and fell; relentless Drona laid the brave Satyajit low!
4770,II,
4771,II,"Surging still like ocean's billows other Pandav warriors came,"
4772,II,"To protect their virtuous monarch and redeem their ancient fame,"
4773,II,
4774,II,"Came in various battle-chariots drawn by steeds of every hue,"
4775,II,Various were the chieftains' standards which the warring nations knew!
4776,II,
4777,II,"Bhima drove his stalwart horses tinted like the dappled deer,"
4778,II,"Grey and pigeon-coloured coursers bore Panchala's prince and peer,"
4779,II,

4781,II,"Brave Nakula's sumptuous chariot in the deathful battle drew,"
4782,II,
4783,II,"Piebald horses trained to battle did young Sahadeva rein,"
4784,II,"Ivory-white Yudhishthir's coursers with their flowing ebon mane,"
4785,II,
4786,II,"And by him with gold umbrella valiant monarch Drupad came,"
4787,II,Horses of a bright-bay colour carried Matsya's king of fame.
4788,II,
4789,II,"Varied as their various coursers gallantly their standards rose,"
4790,II,"With their wondrous strange devices, terror of their arméd foes!"
4791,II,
4792,II,"Water-jar on tawny deerskin, such was Drona's sign of war,--"
4793,II,"Drona as a tender infant rested in a water-jar,"
4794,II,
4795,II,"Golden moon with stars surrounding was Yudhishthir's sign of yore,"
4796,II,"Silver lion was the standard tiger-waisted Bhima bore,"
4797,II,
4798,II,"Brave Nakula's sign was red deer with its back of burnished gold,"
4799,II,"Silver swan with bells resounding Sahadeva's onset told,"
4800,II,
4801,II,"Golden peacock rich-emblazoned was young Abhimanyu's joy,"
4802,II,"Vulture shone on Ghatotkacha, Bhima's proud and gallant boy."
4803,II,
4804,II,"Now Duryodhan marked the foemen heaving like the rising tide,"
4805,II,"And he faced the wrathful Bhima towering in his tameless pride,"
4806,II,
4807,II,"Short the war, for proud Duryodhan wounded from the battle fled,"
4808,II,And his warriors from fair Anga rested with the countless dead!
4809,II,
4810,II,"Wild with anger Bhagadatta, monarch of the farthest East,"
4811,II,"With his still unconquered forces on the valiant Bhima pressed,"
4812,II,
4813,II,"Came from far the wrathful Arjun and the battle's front he sought,"
4814,II,Where by eastern foes surrounded still the stalwart Bhima fought!
4815,II,
4816,II,"Fated monarch from the far-east Brahma-putra's sounding shore,"
4817,II,"Land of rising sun will hail him and his noble peers no more,"
4818,II,
4819,II,"For his tusker pierced by arrows trumpeted his dying wail,"
4820,II,Like a red and flaming meteor gallant Bhagadatta fell!
4821,II,
4822,II,"Then with rising wrath and anguish Karna's noble bosom bled,--"

4824,II,
4825,II,"Ancient hate and jealous anger clouded Karna's warlike heart,"
4826,II,"And while Bhishma led, all idly slumbered Karna's bow and dart!"

4828,II,"Now he marked with warrior's anguish all his comrades fled afar,"
4829,II,And his foeman Arjun sweeping o'er the red field of the war!
4830,II,
4831,II,"Hatred like a tongue of red fire shot from Karna's flaming eye,"
4832,II,And he sprang to meet his foeman or to conquer or to die!
4833,II,
4834,II,"Fierce and dubious was the battle, answering clouds gave back the din,"
4835,II,"Karna met his dearest foeman and, alas! his nearest kin!"
4836,II,
4837,II,"Bhima and Panchala's warriors unto Arjun's rescue came,"
4838,II,"Proud Duryodhan came to Karna, and fair Sindhu's king of fame!"

4855,III,
4856,III,"Brief, alas! thy sunlit winters, light of war too early quenched,"
4857,III,"Peerless son of peerless Arjun, in the blood of foemen drenched!"
4858,III,
4859,III,Drona on that fatal morning ranged his dreadful battle-line
4860,III,"In a circle darkly spreading where the chiefs with chiefs combine,"
4861,III,
4862,III,"And the Pandavs looked despairing on the battle's dread array,"

4867,III,
4868,III,"Elephants and crashing standards, neighing steeds and warriors slain"
4869,III,Fell before the furious hero as he made a ghastly lane!
4870,III,
4871,III,"Proud Duryodhan rushed to battle, strove to stop the turning tide,"
4872,III,"And his stoutest truest warriors fought by proud Duryodhan's side,"
4873,III,
4874,III,"Onward still went Abhimanyu, Kurus strove and fought in vain,"
4875,III,Backward reeled and fell Duryodhan and his bravest chiefs were slain!

4879,III,
4880,III,"Onward still went Abhimanyu, Salya strove and fought in vain,"
4881,III,And his warriors took him bleeding from the reddened battle-plain!

4883,III,"Next Duhsasan darkly lowering thundered with his bended bow,"
4884,III,"Abhimanyu smiled to see him, kinsman and the dearest foe,"
4885,III,
4886,III,"""Art thou he,"" said Abhimanyu, ""known for cruel word and deed,"
4887,III,"Impious in thy heart and purpose, base and ruthless in thy greed?"

4903,III,
4904,III,"Like a snake upon an ant-hill, on Duhsasan's wicked heart,"
4905,III,Fell with hissing wrath and fury Abhimanyu's fiery dart!
4906,III,
4907,III,"From the loss of blood Duhsasan fainted on his battle-car,"
4908,III,Kuru chieftains bore him senseless from the blood-stained scene of war!
4909,III,
4910,III,"Next in gleaming arms accoutred came Duryodhan's gallant son,"
4911,III,"Proud and warlike as his father, famed for deeds of valour done,"
4912,III,
4913,III,"Young in years and rich in valour, for alas! he fought too well,"
4914,III,And before his weeping father proud and gallant Lakshman fell!
4915,III,
4916,III,"Onward still went Abhimanyu midst the dying and the dead,"
4917,III,Shook from rank to rank the Kurus and their shattered army fled!
4918,III,
4919,III,"Then the impious Jayadratha, king of Sindhu's sounding shore,"
4920,III,"Came forth in unrighteous concert with six car-borne warriors more,"
4921,III,
4922,III,"Darkly closed the fatal circle with the gulfing surge's moan,"
4923,III,"Dauntless, with the seven brave chieftains Abhimanyu fought alone!"
4924,III,
4925,III,"Fell, alas! his peacock standard and his car was broke in twain,"
4926,III,"Bow and sabre rent and shattered and his faithful driver slain,"
4927,III,
4928,III,"Heedless yet of death and danger, misty with the loss of blood,"
4929,III,"Abhimanyu wiped his forehead, gazed where dark his foemen stood!"
4930,III,
4931,III,"Then with wild despairing valour, flickering flame and closing life,"
4932,III,"Mace in hand the heedless warrior rushed to end the mortal strife,"
4933,III,
4934,III,"Rushed upon his startled foemen, Abhimanyu fought and fell,"
4935,III,And his deeds to distant ages bards and wand'ring minstrels tell!
4936,III,
4937,III,"Like a tusker of the forest by surrounding hunters slain,"
4938,III,"Like a wood-consuming wildfire quenched upon the distant plain,"
4939,III,
4940,III,"Like a mountain-shaking tempest, spent in force and hushed and still,"
4941,III,"Like the red resplendent day-god setting on the western hill,"
4942,III,
4943,III,"Like the moon serene and beauteous quenched in eclipse, dark and pale,"
4944,III,Lifeless slumbered Abhimanyu when the softened starlight fell!
4945,III,
4946,III,"Done the day of death and slaughter, darkening shadows close around,"

4950,III,Cast their fitful gleam and radiance on the carnage of the war!
4951,III,
4952,III,"Arjun from a field at distance, where upon that day he fought,"
4953,III,"With the ever faithful Krishna now his nightly shelter sought,"
4954,III,
4955,III,"""Wherefore, Krishna,"" uttered Arjun, ""evil omens strike my eye,"
4956,III,"Thoughts of sadness fill my bosom, wake the long-forgotten sigh?"
4957,III,
4958,III,"Wherefore voice of evening bugle speaks not on the battle-field,"
4959,III,Merry conch nor sounding trumpet music to the warriors yield?
4960,III,
4961,III,"Harp is hushed within the dark tents and the voice of warlike song,"
4962,III,Bards beside the evening camp-fire tales of war do not prolong!
4963,III,
4964,III,"Good Yudhishthir's tent is voiceless, and my brothers look so pale,"
4965,III,Abhimanyu comes not joyous Krishna and his sire to hail!
4966,III,
4967,III,"Abhimanyu's love and greeting bless like blessings from above,"
4968,III,"Fair Subhadra's joy and treasure, Arjun's pride and hope and love!"""
4969,III,
4970,III,"Softly and with many tear-drops did the sad Yudhishthir tell,"

4973,III,"How the impious Jayadratha fell on Arjun's youthful son,--"
4974,III,"He with six proud Kuru chieftains,--Abhimanyu all alone!"
4975,III,
4976,III,"How the young prince, reft of weapon and deprived of steed and car,"
4977,III,Fell as falls a Kshatra warrior fighting on the field of war!
4978,III,
4979,III,"Arjun heard; the father's bosom felt the cruel cureless wound,"
4980,III,"""Brave and gallant boy!"" said Arjun;--and he sank upon the ground!"
4981,III,
4982,III,"Moments passed of voiceless sorrow and of speechless bitter tear,"
4983,III,Sobs within his mailéd bosom smote the weeping listener's ear!
4984,III,
4985,III,"Moments passed; with rising anger quivered Arjun's iron frame,"
4986,III,Abhimanyu's cruel murder smote the father's heart to flame!
4987,III,
4988,III,"""Didst thou say that Sindhu's monarch on my Abhimanyu bore,--"
4989,III,"He alone,--and Jayadratha leagued with six marauders more?"
4990,III,

4992,III,"Outrage on the laws of honour, stain upon a warrior's fame?"
4993,III,
4994,III,"Father's curse and warrior's hatred sting them to their dying breath,"
4995,III,"For they feared my boy in battle, hunted him to cruel death,"
4996,III,
4997,III,"Hear my vow, benign Yudhishthir, hear me, Krishna righteous lord,"
4998,III,"Arjun's hand shall slay the slayer, Arjun plights his solemn word!"

5020,III,
5021,III,"And thy limbs so young and tender, on the bare earth do they lie,"
5022,III,Where the hungry jackal prowleth and the vulture flutters nigh?
5023,III,
5024,III,"Gold and jewels graced thy bosom, gems bedecked thy lofty crest,"

5032,III,
5033,III,"And oh! cheerless is that young heart, Abhimanyu's princess-wife,"
5034,III,What can sad Subhadra offer to her joyless sunless life?
5035,III,
5036,III,"Close our life in equal darkness, for our day on earth is done,"

5063,IV,
5064,IV,"Drona then, the proud preceptor, Arjun's furious progress stayed,"
5065,IV,Tear-drops filled the eye of Arjun as these gentle words he said:

5072,IV,
5073,IV,"Heavy on this bleeding bosom sits the darkening load of woe,"

5077,IV,"Mighty is the vow of Arjun, cruel is his task to-day!"""
5078,IV,

5154,IV,"Karna deemed the evening darkness now proclaimed the close of strife,"

5173,IV,"Proud Duryodhan's many brothers were by vengeful Bhima slain,"
5174,IV,
5175,IV,"And Duryodhan, stung by sorrow, waged the still unceasing fight,"

5199,V,
5200,V,"Ere the crimson morning glittered proud Duryodhan sad at heart,"
5201,V,To the leader of the Kurus did his sorrows thus impart:
5202,V,
5203,V,"""Sadly speeds the contest, Drona, on the battle's gory plain,"
5204,V,Kuru chiefs are thinned and fallen and my brothers mostly slain!
5205,V,
5206,V,"Can it be, O beat of Brahmans! peerless in the art of war,"
5207,V,Can it be that we shall falter while thou speed'st the battle-car?
5208,V,
5209,V,"Pandu's sons are but thy pupils, Arjun meets thee not in fight,"
5210,V,None can face the great _acharya_ in his wrath and warlike might!
5211,V,
5212,V,"Wherefore then in every battle are the Kuru chieftains slain,"
5213,V,Wherefore lie my warlike brothers lifeless on the ghastly plain?
5214,V,
5215,V,"Is it that the fates of battle 'gainst the Kuru house combine,"
5216,V,Is it that thy heart's affection unto Panda's sons incline?
5217,V,
5218,V,"If thy secret love and mercy still the sons of Pandu claim,"
5219,V,"Yield thy place to gallant Karna, Anga's prince of warlike fame!"""
5220,V,
5221,V,"Answered Drona brief and wrathful: ""Fair Gandhari's royal son,"

5225,V,"Faithful unto death is Drona, to his promise plighted fair!"
5226,V,
5227,V,"Ask thyself, O prince Duryodhan! bound by battle's sacred laws,"
5228,V,Wherefore fightest not with Arjun for thy house and for thy cause?
5229,V,
5230,V,"Ask the dark and deep Sakuni, where is now his low device,"
5231,V,Wherefore wields he not his weapon as he wields the loaded dice?

5234,V,"Helméd Arjun sways the battle, whither now doth Karna stay?"
5235,V,
5236,V,"Know the truth; the gallant Arjun hath no peer on earth below,"
5237,V,"And no warrior breathes, Duryodhan, who can face thy helméd foe!"
5238,V,
5239,V,"Drona knows his sacred duty; and 'tis willed by Heaven on high,"
5240,V,"Arjun or preceptor Drona shall in this day's battle die!"""
5241,V,

5244,V,
5245,V,"And from elephant and charger, from each bravely bannered car,"
5246,V,"Lighted mailéd kings and chieftains and the leaders of the war,"

5253,V,
5254,V,"Ill it fared with Pandav forces, doughty Drona took the field,"
5255,V,Peer was none midst living warriors of the Brahman trained and skilled!
5256,V,

5262,V,
5263,V,"Wrathful princes of Panchala by their deathless hatred stung,"
5264,V,Saw their ancient foe in Drona and on him for vengeance sprung!
5265,V,

5269,V,"Royal Drupad's valiant grandsons in their youth untimely slain,"

5276,V,"Rushed the king, and bold Virata charged by doughty Drupad's side!"
5277,V,
5278,V,"Rose a cry of nameless terror o'er the red and ghastly plain,"
5279,V,"Noble Drupad, brave Virata, lay among the countless slain!"
5280,V,
5281,V,"Burning tears the proud Draupadi wept for noble father killed,"
5282,V,Maid and matron with their wailing fair Panchala's empire filled!
5283,V,
5284,V,"Matsya's joyless, widowed princess, for her fate was early crost,"

5286,V,
5287,V,"Waged the war with fearful slaughter, Drona onward urged his way,"
5288,V,"Fate alone and battle's chances changed the fortunes of the day,"
5289,V,
5290,V,"Aswa-thaman, son of Drona, was a chief of peerless fame,"
5291,V,"And an elephant of battle bore that chieftain's warlike name,"
5292,V,
5293,V,"And that proud and lordly tusker, Bhima in his prowess slew,"
5294,V,"Rank to rank, from friend to foeman, then a garbled message flew:"
5295,V,
5296,V,"""Aswa-thaman son of Drona is by mighty Bhima slain!"""
5297,V,"Drona heard that fatal message, bent his anguished head in pain!"
5298,V,
5299,V,"""Speak Yudhishthir, soul of virtue!"" thus the proud preceptor cried,"
5300,V,"""Thou in truth hast never faltered, and thy lips have never lied,"
5301,V,

5312,V,"Marked his father's cruel slayer, marked his noble father slain!"
5313,V,
5314,V,"Dhrista-dyumna bent his weapon and his shaft was pointed well,"
5315,V,"And the priest and proud preceptor, peerless Drona lifeless fell!"
5316,V,
5317,V,"And the fatal day was ended, Kurus fled in abject fear,"
5318,V,Arjun for his ancient teacher dropped a silent filial tear!

5330,KARNA-BADHA,Karna was chosen as the leader of the Kuru forces after the death of
5331,KARNA-BADHA,"Drona, and held his own for two days. The great contest between Karna"
5332,KARNA-BADHA,"and Arjun, long expected and long deferred, came on at last. It is"
5333,KARNA-BADHA,"the crowning incident of the Indian Epic, as the contest between"
5334,KARNA-BADHA,Hector and Achilles is the crowning incident of the Iliad. With a
5335,KARNA-BADHA,"truer artistic skill than that of Homer, the Indian poet represents"
5336,KARNA-BADHA,"Karna as equal to Arjun in strength and skill, and his defeat is only"
5337,KARNA-BADHA,due to an accident.
5338,KARNA-BADHA,
5339,KARNA-BADHA,"After the death of Karna, Salya led the Kuru troops on the eighteenth"
5340,KARNA-BADHA,"and last day of the war, and fell. A midnight slaughter in the Pandav"
5341,KARNA-BADHA,"camp, perpetrated by the vengeful son of Drona, concludes the war."
5342,KARNA-BADHA,"Duryodhan, left wounded by Bhima, heard of the slaughter and died"
5343,KARNA-BADHA,happy.

5351,I,
5352,I,"Sights of red and ghastly carnage day disclosed upon the plain,"
5353,I,Mighty chiefs and countless warriors round the warlike Drona slain!
5354,I,
5355,I,"Sad Duryodhan gazed in sorrow and the tear was in his eye,"
5356,I,Till his glances fell on Karna and his warlike heart beat high!
5357,I,
5358,I,"""Karna!"" so exclaimed Duryodhan, ""hero of resistless might,"
5359,I,"Thou alone canst serve the Kuru in this dread and dubious fight,"

5362,I,Lead the still unconquered Kurus to the trophies of the war!
5363,I,
5364,I,"Matchless was the ancient Bhishma in this famed and warlike land,"
5365,I,"But a weakness for Yudhishthir palsied Bhishma's slaying hand,"
5366,I,
5367,I,"Matchless too was doughty Drona in the warrior's skill and art,"
5368,I,Kindness for his pupil Arjun lurked within the teacher's heart!
5369,I,
5370,I,"Greater than the ancient grandsire, greater than the Brahman old,"
5371,I,"Fiercer in thy deathless hatred, stronger in thy prowess bold,"
5372,I,
5373,I,"Peerless Karna! lead us onward to a brighter, happier fate,"
5374,I,For thy arm is nerved to action by an unforgotten hate!
5375,I,
5376,I,"Lead us as the martial SKANDA led the conquering gods of old,"
5377,I,"Smite the foe as angry INDRA smote the Danavs fierce and bold,"
5378,I,
5379,I,"As before the light of morning flies the baleful gloom of night,"
5380,I,"Pandavs and the proud Panchalas fly before thy conquering might!"""
5381,I,

5385,I,"Earthen jars they placed around him with the sacred water full,"
5386,I,"Elephant's tusk they laid beside him and the horn of mighty bull,"

5388,I,"Gem and jewel, corn and produce, by the arméd hero laid,"
5389,I,"Silken cloth of finest lustre o'er his crested head they spread,"

5399,I,
5400,I,"Morn to noon and noon to evening raged the battle on the plain,"
5401,I,"Countless warriors fought and perished, car-borne chiefs were pierced"
5402,I,and slain!
5403,I,
5404,I,"Helméd Arjun, crested Karna, met at last by will of fate,"
5405,I,"Life-long was their mutual anger, deathless was their mutual hate!"
5406,I,
5407,I,"And the firm earth shook and trembled 'neath the furious rush of war,"
5408,I,"And the echoing welkin answered shouts that nations heard from far,"
5409,I,
5410,I,"And the thickening cloud of arrows filled the firmament on high,"
5411,I,"Darker, deeper, dread and deadlier, grew the angry face of sky,"
5412,I,
5413,I,"Till the evening's sable garment mantled o'er the battle-field,"

5428,II,
5429,II,"But yon sun with crimson lustre sees us meet to part no more,"
5430,II,Gallant Arjun's course this evening or proud Karna's shall be o'er!
5431,II,
5432,II,"Room is none for Arjun's glory and for archer Karna's fame,"
5433,II,"One must sink and one must sparkle with a brighter, richer flame!"
5434,II,
5435,II,"List yet more; in wealth of arrows and in wondrous strength of bow,"
5436,II,"Arjun scarcely me surpasseth, scarcely I excel my foe!"
5437,II,
5438,II,"In the light skill of the archer and in sight and truth of aim,"
5439,II,"Arjun beats not, scarcely rivals, Karna's proud and peerless fame!"
5440,II,
5441,II,"If his wondrous bow _gandiva_ is the gift of gods in heaven,"
5442,II,Karna's bow the famed _vijaya_ is by Par'su-Rama given!
5443,II,
5444,II,"Ay, the son of Jamadagni, kings of earth who proudly slayed,"
5445,II,On the youthful arms of Karna his destructive weapon laid!
5446,II,
5447,II,"Yet I own, O king of Kuru! Arjun doth his foe excel,--"
5448,II,"Matchless are his fiery coursers, peerless Krishna leads them well!"
5449,II,
5450,II,"Krishna holds the reins for Arjun, Krishna speeds his battle-car,"
5451,II,Drives the lightning-wingéd coursers o'er the startled field of war!
5452,II,
5453,II,"Sweeps in pride his sounding chariot till it almost seems to fly,"
5454,II,Arjun lords it o'er the battle like the comet in the sky!
5455,II,
5456,II,"Grant me, monarch, mighty Salya drive my swift and warlike steed,"
5457,II,"And against the car-borne Arjun, Karna's fiery chariot lead!"
5458,II,
5459,II,"Salya too is skilled, like Krishna, with the steed and battle-car,"
5460,II,"Equal thus I meet my foeman in this last and fatal war!"""
5461,II,
5462,II,"Spake Duryodhan; warlike Salya mounted Karna's sounding car,"

5465,II,"""Hundred milch-kine Karna offers, costly garment, yellow gold,"
5466,II,Unto him who in this battle points to me my foeman bold!
5467,II,
5468,II,"Cars and steeds and fertile acres, peaceful hamlets rich and fair,"
5469,II,"Dark-eyed damsels lotus-bosomed, crowned with glossy raven hair,"
5470,II,
5471,II,"These are his who points to Karna, Arjun hiding from this war,"
5472,II,"Arjun's snowy steeds and banner and his swift and thund'ring car!"""
5473,II,
5474,II,"Karna spake, but long and loudly laughed the king of Madra's land,"
5475,II,"As he reined the fiery coursers with his strong and skilful hand,"
5476,II,
5477,II,"""Of rewards and gifts,"" he uttered, ""little need is there, I ween,"
5478,II,Arjun is not wont to tarry from the battle's glorious scene!
5479,II,
5480,II,"Soon will Arjun's snowy coursers shake the battle's startled field,"
5481,II,Helméd Arjun like a comet gleam with bow and sword and shield!
5482,II,
5483,II,"As the forest-ranging tiger springs upon his fated prey,"
5484,II,"As the hornéd bull, infuriate, doth the weakling cattle slay,"
5485,II,
5486,II,"As the fierce and lordly lion smites the timid jungle-deer,"
5487,II,"Arjun soon shall spring upon thee, for he knows nor dread nor fear,"
5488,II,
5489,II,"Save thee then, O mighty archer! while I drive my sounding car,"
5490,II,"Pandu's son hath met no equal in the valiant art of war!"""
5491,II,
5492,II,"Darkly frowned the angry Karna, Salya held the loosened rein,"
5493,II,"Dashing through the hostile forces then the warrior sped amain,"
5494,II,
5495,II,"Through the serried ranks of battle Karna drove in furious mood,"
5496,II,Facing him in royal splendour good Yudhishthir fearless stood!
5497,II,
5498,II,"Surging ranks of brave Nishadas closed between and fought in vain,"
5499,II,"Proud Panchalas, stout and faithful, vainly strove among the slain,"
5500,II,
5501,II,"Onward came the fiery Karna like the ocean's heaving swell,"
5502,II,With the sweeping wrath of tempest on the good Yudhishthir fell!
5503,II,
5504,II,"Wrathful then the son of Pandu marked his noblest chieftains dead,"
5505,II,And in words of scornful anger thus to archer Karna said:
5506,II,
5507,II,"""Hast thou, Karna, vowed the slaughter of my younger Arjun brave?"
5508,II,"Wilt thou do Duryodhan's mandate, proud Duryodhan's willing slave?"
5509,II,
5510,II,"Unfulfilled thy vow remaineth, for the righteous gods ordain,"
5511,II,"By Yudhishthir's hand thou fallest, go and slumber with the slain!"""
5512,II,
5513,II,"Fiercely drew his bow Yudhishthir, fiercely was the arrow driven,"
5514,II,Rocky cliff or solid mountain might the shaft have pierced and riven!
5515,II,
5516,II,"Lightning-like it came on Karna, struck and pierced him on the left,"
5517,II,And the warrior fell and fainted as of life and sense bereft!
5518,II,
5519,II,"Soon he rose; the cloud of anger darkened o'er his livid face,"
5520,II,And he drew his godlike weapon with a more than human grace!
5521,II,
5522,II,"Arrows keen and dark as midnight, gleaming in their lightning flight,"
5523,II,Struck Yudhishthir's royal armour with a fierce resistless might!
5524,II,
5525,II,"Clanking fell the shattered armour from his person fair and pale,"
5526,II,As from sun's meridian splendour clouds are drifted by the gale!
5527,II,
5528,II,"Armourless but bright and radiant brave Yudhishthir waged the fight,"
5529,II,Bright as sky with stars bespangled on a clear and cloudless night!
5530,II,
5531,II,"And he threw his pointed lances like the summer's bursting flood,"
5532,II,Once again Yudhishthir's weapons drank his fiery foeman's blood!
5533,II,
5534,II,"Pale with anguish, wrathful Karna fiercely turned the tide of war,"
5535,II,"Cut Yudhishthir's royal standard, crashed his sumptuous battle-car,"
5536,II,
5537,II,"And he urged his gallant coursers till his chariot bounding flew,"
5538,II,And with more than godlike prowess then his famed _vijaya_ drew!
5539,II,
5540,II,"Faint Yudhishthir sorely bleeding waged no more the fatal fight,"
5541,II,"Carless, steedless, void of armour, sought his safety in his flight!"
5542,II,
5543,II,"""Speed, thou timid man of penance!"" proud insulting Karna said,"
5544,II,"""Famed for virtue not for valour! blood of thine I will not shed!"

5548,II,
5549,II,"To his tent retired Yudhishthir in his wrath and in his shame,"
5550,II,Spake to Arjun who from battle to his angry elder came:
5551,II,
5552,II,"""Hast thou yet, O tardy Arjun! base, insulting Karna slain,"
5553,II,Karna dealing dire destruction on this battle's reddened plain?
5554,II,
5555,II,"Like his teacher Par'su-Rama dyes in purple blood his course,"
5556,II,Like a snake of deathful poison Karna guards the Kuru force!
5557,II,
5558,II,"Karna smote my chariot-driver and my standard rent in twain,"
5559,II,"Shattered car and lifeless horses strew the red inglorious plain,"
5560,II,
5561,II,"Scarce with life in speechless anguish from the battle-field I fled,"
5562,II,Scorn of foes and shame of kinsmen! Warrior's fame and honour dead!
5563,II,
5564,II,"Ten long years and three Yudhishthir joy nor peace nor rest hath seen,"
5565,II,"And while Karna lives and glories, all our insults still are green,"
5566,II,
5567,II,"Hast thou, Arjun, slain that chieftain as in swelling pride he stood,"
5568,II,"Hast thou wiped our wrongs and insults in that chariot-driver's blood?"""
5569,II,
5570,II,"""At a distance,"" Krishna answered, ""fiery Arjun fought his way,"
5571,II,"Now he meets the archer Karna, and he vows his death to-day."""
5572,II,
5573,II,"Anger lit Yudhishthir's forehead, and a tremor shook his frame,"
5574,II,As he spake to silent Arjun words of insult and of shame:
5575,II,
5576,II,"""Wherefore like a painted warrior doth the helméd Arjun stand,"
5577,II,"Wherefore useless lies _gandiva_ in his weak and nerveless hand,"
5578,II,
5579,II,"Wherefore hangs yon mighty sabre from his belt of silk and gold,"
5580,II,"Wherefore doth the peerless Krishna drive his coursers fleet and bold,"
5581,II,
5582,II,"If afar from war's arena timid Arjun seeks to hide,"
5583,II,If he shuns the mighty Karna battling in unconquered pride?
5584,II,
5585,II,"Arjun! yield thy famed _gandiva_ unto worthier hands than thine,"
5586,II,"On some braver, truer warrior let thy mighty standard shine,"
5587,II,
5588,II,"Yield thy helmet and thy armour, yield thy gleaming sword and shield,"
5589,II,"Hide thee from this deathful battle, matchless Karna rules the field!"""
5590,II,
5591,II,"Sparkled Arjun's eye in anger with a red and livid flame,"
5592,II,"And the tempest of his passion shook his more than mortal frame,"
5593,II,
5594,II,"Heedless, on the sword-hilt Arjun placed his swift and trembling hand,"
5595,II,"Heedless, with a warrior's instinct drew the dark and glistening brand!"
5596,II,
5597,II,"Sacred blood of king and elder would have stained his trenchant steel,"
5598,II,But the wise and noble Krishna strove the fatal feud to heal:
5599,II,
5600,II,"""Not before thy elder, Arjun, but in yonder purple field,"
5601,II,'Gainst thy rival and thy foeman use thy warlike sword and shield!
5602,II,
5603,II,"Render honour to thy elder, quench thy hasty, impious wrath,"
5604,II,"Sin not 'gainst holy _sastra_, leave not virtue's sacred path!"
5605,II,
5606,II,"Bow before thy virtuous elder as before the gods in heaven,"
5607,II,"Sheathe thy sword and quell thy passion, be thy hasty sin forgiven!"""
5608,II,
5609,II,"Duteous Arjun silent listened and obeyed the mandate high,"
5610,II,"Tears of manly sorrow trickled from his soft and altered eye,"
5611,II,
5612,II,"Dear in joy and dear in suffering, calm his righteous elder stood,"
5613,II,"Dear in Indra-prastha's mansions, dearer in the jungle wood!"
5614,II,
5615,II,"Arjun sheathed his flashing sabre, joined his hands and hung his head,"
5616,II,Fixed his eye on good Yudhishthir and in humble accents said:
5617,II,
5618,II,"""Pardon, great and saintly monarch, vassal's disrespectful word,"
5619,II,"Pardon, elder, if a younger heedless drew his sinful sword!"
5620,II,
5621,II,"But thy hest to yield my weapon stung my soul to bitter strife,"
5622,II,Dearer is the bow _gandiva_ unto Arjun than his life!
5623,II,
5624,II,"Pardon if the blood of anger mantled o'er this rugged brow,"
5625,II,Pardon if I drew my sabre 'gainst my duty and my vow!

5629,II,
5630,II,"From Yudhishthir's altered eyelids gentle tears of sorrow start,"

5633,II,"""Arjun, I have wronged thee brother, and no fault or sin is thine,"
5634,II,Hasty words of thoughtless anger 'scaped these sinful lips of mine!

5636,II,"Bitter was my shame and anguish when from Karna's car I fled,"
5637,II,Redder than my bleeding bosom warrior's fame and honour bled!
5638,II,
5639,II,"Hasty words I uttered, Arjun, by my pain and anguish driven,"

5648,II,"Often met and often parted, life-long rivals in their fame,"
5649,II,"Not to part again, the heroes, each unto the other came,"
5650,II,
5651,II,"Not to part until a chieftain by the other chief was slain,"

5655,II,"Though like surging ocean billows did the angry warriors meet,"
5656,II,

5672,II,"Like the cobra, dark and hissing, Karna's gleaming lightning dart,"
5673,II,Struck the helpless archer Arjun on his broad and bleeding heart!
5674,II,
5675,II,"Furious like a wounded tiger quivering in the darksome wood,"
5676,II,"With his mended warlike weapon now the angry Arjun stood,"
5677,II,
5678,II,"Blazing with a mighty radiance like a flame in summer night,"
5679,II,Fierce he fell on archer Karna with his more than mortal might!

6325,ASWA-MEDHA,(Sacrifice of the Horse)
6326,ASWA-MEDHA,
6327,ASWA-MEDHA,
6328,ASWA-MEDHA,The real Epic ends with the war and the funerals of the deceased
6329,ASWA-MEDHA,warriors. Much of what follows in the original Sanscrit poem is
6330,ASWA-MEDHA,either episodical or comparatively recent interpolation. The great
6331,ASWA-MEDHA,"and venerable warrior Bhishma, still lying on his death bed,"
6332,ASWA-MEDHA,discourses for the instruction of the newly crowned Yudhishthir on
6333,ASWA-MEDHA,"various subjects like the Duties of Kings, the Duties of the Four"
6334,ASWA-MEDHA,"Castes, and the Four Stages of Life. He repeats the discourses of"
6335,ASWA-MEDHA,"other saints, of Bhrigu and Bharadwaja, of Manu and Brihaspati, of"
6336,ASWA-MEDHA,"Vyasa and Suka, of Yajnavalkya and Janaka, of Narada and Narayana."
6337,ASWA-MEDHA,"He explains _Sankhya_ philosophy and _Yoga_ philosophy, and lays down"
6338,ASWA-MEDHA,"the laws of Marriage, the laws of Succession, the rules of Gifts,"
6339,ASWA-MEDHA,"and the rules of Funeral Rites. He preaches the cult of Krishna, and"
6340,ASWA-MEDHA,"narrates endless legends, tales, traditions, and myths about sages"
6341,ASWA-MEDHA,"and saints, gods and mortal kings. All this is told in two Books"
6342,ASWA-MEDHA,"containing about twenty-two thousand couplets, and forming nearly"
6343,ASWA-MEDHA,one-fourth of the entire Sanscrit Epic!
6344,ASWA-MEDHA,
6345,ASWA-MEDHA,The reason of adding all this episodical and comparatively recent
6346,ASWA-MEDHA,matter to the ancient Epic is not far to seek. The Epic became
6347,ASWA-MEDHA,more popular with the nation at large than dry codes of law and
6348,ASWA-MEDHA,"philosophy, and generations of Brahmanical writers laboured therefore"
6349,ASWA-MEDHA,"to insert in the Epic itself their rules of caste and moral conduct,"
6350,ASWA-MEDHA,their laws and philosophy. There is no more venerable character in
6351,ASWA-MEDHA,"the Epic than Bhishma, and these rules and laws have therefore been"
6352,ASWA-MEDHA,supposed to come from his lips on the solemn occasion of his death.
6353,ASWA-MEDHA,As a storehouse of Hindu laws and traditions and moral rules these
6354,ASWA-MEDHA,"episodes are invaluable; but they form no part of the real Epic, they"
6355,ASWA-MEDHA,"are not a portion of the leading story of the Epic, and we pass them"
6356,ASWA-MEDHA,by.
6357,ASWA-MEDHA,
6358,ASWA-MEDHA,"Bhishma dies and is cremated; but the endless exposition of laws,"
6359,ASWA-MEDHA,"legends, and moral rules is not yet over. Krishna himself takes"
6360,ASWA-MEDHA,"up the task in a new Book, and, as he has done once before in the"
6361,ASWA-MEDHA,"_Bhagavat-gita_, he now once more explains to Arjun in the _Anu-gita_"
6362,ASWA-MEDHA,"the great truths about Soul and Emancipation, Creation and the Wheel"
6363,ASWA-MEDHA,"of Life, True Knowledge and Rites and Penance. The adventures of the"
6364,ASWA-MEDHA,"sage Utanka, whom Krishna meets, then take up a good many pages. All"
6365,ASWA-MEDHA,"this forms no part of the real Epic, and we pass it by."
6366,ASWA-MEDHA,
6367,ASWA-MEDHA,Yudhishthir has in the meantime been crowned king of the Kurus
6368,ASWA-MEDHA,"at Hastinapura, and a posthumous child of Abhimanyu is named"
6369,ASWA-MEDHA,"Parikshit, and is destined to succeed to the throne of the Kurus. But"
6370,ASWA-MEDHA,Yudhishthir's mind is still troubled with the thoughts of the carnage
6371,ASWA-MEDHA,"of the war, of which he considers himself guilty, and the great saint"
6372,ASWA-MEDHA,"Vyasa advises the performance of the _aswa-medha_, or the Sacrifice"
6373,ASWA-MEDHA,"of the Horse, for the expiation of the sin."
6374,ASWA-MEDHA,
6375,ASWA-MEDHA,The Sacrifice of the Horse was an ancient Hindu custom practised by
6376,ASWA-MEDHA,kings exercising suzerain powers over surrounding kings. A horse was
6377,ASWA-MEDHA,"let free, and was allowed to wander from place to place, accompanied"
6378,ASWA-MEDHA,by the king's guard. If any neighbouring king ventured to detain the
6379,ASWA-MEDHA,"animal, it was a signal for war. If no king ventured to restrain the"
6380,ASWA-MEDHA,"wanderer, it was considered a tacit mark of submission to the owner"
6381,ASWA-MEDHA,"of the animal. And when the horse returned from its peregrinations,"
6382,ASWA-MEDHA,it was sacrificed with great pomp and splendour at a feast to which
6383,ASWA-MEDHA,all neighbouring kings were invited.
6384,ASWA-MEDHA,
6385,ASWA-MEDHA,"Yudhishthir allowed the sacrificial horse to wander at will, and"
6386,ASWA-MEDHA,"Arjun accompanied it. Wherever the horse was stopped, Arjun fought"
6387,ASWA-MEDHA,"and conquered, and thus proclaimed the supremacy of Yudhishthir over"
6388,ASWA-MEDHA,all neighbouring potentates. After various wars and adventures in
6389,ASWA-MEDHA,"various regions, Arjun at last returned victorious with the steed"
6390,ASWA-MEDHA,"to Hastinapura, and the sacrifice commenced. The description of the"
6391,ASWA-MEDHA,"sacrifice is somewhat artificial, and concerns itself with rites"
6392,ASWA-MEDHA,"and ceremonious details and gifts to Brahmans, and altogether bears"
6393,ASWA-MEDHA,unmistakable evidence of the interpolating hand of later priestly
6394,ASWA-MEDHA,writers. Nevertheless we cannot exclude from this translation of
6395,ASWA-MEDHA,the leading incidents of the Epic the last great and crowning act
6396,ASWA-MEDHA,"of Yudhishthir, now anointed monarch of Kuru land."

6771,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6772,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6773,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"Ancient India, like ancient Greece, boasts of two great Epics. One"
6774,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"of them, the _Maha-bharata_, relates to a great war in which all the"
6775,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"warlike races of Northern India took a share, and may therefore be"
6776,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"compared to the Iliad. The other, the _Ramayana_, relates mainly to"
6777,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the adventures of its hero, banished from his country and wandering"
6778,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"for long years in the wildernesses of Southern India, and may"
6779,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,therefore be compared to the Odyssey. It is the first of these
6780,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"two Epics, the Iliad of Ancient India, which is the subject of"
6781,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,tile foregoing pages.
6782,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6783,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,The great war which is the subject of this Epic is believed to have
6784,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,been fought in the thirteenth or fourteenth century before Christ.
6785,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,For generations and centuries after the war its main incidents must
6786,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,have been sung by bards and minstrels in the courts of Northern
6787,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"India. The war thus became the centre of a cycle of legends, songs,"
6788,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"and poems in ancient India, even as Charlemagne and Arthur became the"
6789,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"centres of legends in mediæval Europe. And then, probably under"
6790,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the direction of some enlightened king, the vast mass of legends and"
6791,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"poetry, accumulated during centuries, was cast in a narrative form"
6792,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"and formed the Epic of the Great Bharata nation, and therefore called"
6793,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,the _Maha-bharata_. The real facts of the war had been obliterated by
6794,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"age, legendary heroes had become the principal actors, and, as is"
6795,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"invariably the case in India, the thread of a high moral purpose, of"
6796,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the triumph of virtue and the subjugation of vice, was woven into the"
6797,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,fabric of the great Epic.
6798,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6799,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"We should have been thankful if this Epic, as it was thus originally"
6800,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"put together some centuries before the Christian era, had been"
6801,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,preserved to us. But this was not to be. The Epic became so popular
6802,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,that it went on growing with the growth of centuries. Every
6803,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,generation of poets had something to add; every distant nation in
6804,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,Northern India was anxious to interpolate some account of its deeds
6805,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,in the old record of the international war; every preacher of a new
6806,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,creed desired to have in the old Epic some sanction for the new
6807,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,truths he inculcated. Passages from legal and moral codes were
6808,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,incorporated in the work which appealed to the nation much more
6809,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,effectively than dry codes; and rules about the different castes and
6810,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,about the different stages of the human life were included for the
6811,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"same purpose. All the floating mass of tales, traditions, legends,"
6812,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"and myths, for which ancient India was famous, found a shelter under"
6813,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,the expanding wings of this wonderful Epic; and as Krishna-worship
6814,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"became the prevailing religion of India after the decay of Buddhism,"
6815,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the old Epic caught the complexion of the times, and Krishna-cult is"
6816,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,its dominating religious idea in its present shape. It is thus that
6817,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,the work went on growing for a thousand years after it was first
6818,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,compiled and put together in the form of an Epic; until the crystal
6819,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,rill of the Epic itself was all but lost in an unending morass of
6820,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"religious and didactic episodes, legends, tales, and traditions."
6821,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6822,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"When the mischief had been done, and the Epic had nearly assumed its"
6823,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"present proportions, a few centuries after Christ according to the"
6824,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"late Dr. Bühler, an attempt was made to prevent the further"
6825,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,expansion of the work. The contents of the Epic were described in
6826,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"some prefatory verses, and the number of couplets in each Book was"
6827,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"stated. The total number of couplets, according to this metrical"
6828,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"preface, is about eighty-five thousand. But the limit so fixed"
6829,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,has been exceeded in still later centuries; further additions and
6830,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,interpolations have been made; and the Epic as printed and published
6831,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"in Calcutta in this century contains over ninety thousand couplets,"
6832,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,excluding the Supplement about the Race of Hari.
6833,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6834,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,The modern reader will now understand the reason why this great
6835,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,Epic--the greatest work of imagination that Asia has produced--has
6836,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,never yet been put before the European reader in a readable form. A
6837,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"poem of ninety thousand couplets, about seven times the size of the"
6838,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"Iliad and the Odyssey put together, is more than what the average"
6839,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,reader can stand; and the heterogeneous nature of its contents does
6840,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,not add to the interest of the work. If the religious works of
6841,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"Hooker and Jeremy Taylor, the philosophy of Hobbes and Locke, the"
6842,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"commentaries of Blackstone and the ballads of Percy, together with"
6843,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the tractarian writings of Newman, Keble, and Pusey, were all thrown"
6844,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"into blank verse and incorporated with the Paradise Lost, the reader"
6845,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,would scarcely be much to blame if he failed to appreciate that
6846,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,delectable compound. A complete translation of the _Maha-bharata_
6847,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"therefore into English verse is neither possible nor desirable, but"
6848,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,portions of it have now and then been placed before English readers
6849,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,by distinguished writers. Dean Milman's graceful rendering of the
6850,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,story of Nala and Damayanti is still read and appreciated by a select
6851,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,circle of readers; and Sir Edwin Arnold's beautiful translation of
6852,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,the concluding books of the Epic is familiar to a larger circle of
6853,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,Englishmen. A complete translation of the Epic into English prose has
6854,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"also been published in India, and is useful to Sanscrit scholars for"
6855,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,the purpose of reference.
6856,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6857,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,But although the old Epic had thus been spoilt by unlimited
6858,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"expansion, yet nevertheless the leading incidents and characters of"
6859,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the real Epic are still discernible, uninjured by the mass of foreign"
6860,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,substance in which they are embedded--even like those immortal marble
6861,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"figures which have been recovered from the ruins of an ancient world,"
6862,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,and now beautify the museums of modern Europe. For years past I have
6863,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,thought that it was perhaps not impossible to exhume this buried Epic
6864,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"from the superincumbent mass of episodical matter, and to restore"
6865,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,it to the modern world. For years past I have felt a longing to
6866,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"undertake this work, but the task was by no means an easy one."
6867,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"Leaving out all episodical matter, the leading narrative of the Epic"
6868,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,forms about one-fourth of the work; and a complete translation even
6869,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"of this leading story would be unreadable, both from its length and"
6870,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"its prolixness. On the other hand, to condense the story into shorter"
6871,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"limits would be, not to make a translation, but virtually to write a"
6872,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"new poem; and that was not what I desired to undertake, nor what I"
6873,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,was competent to perform.
6874,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6875,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,There seemed to me only one way out of this difficulty. The
6876,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,main incidents of the Epic are narrated in the original work in
6877,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"passages which are neither diffuse nor unduly prolix, and which are"
6878,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"interspersed in the leading narrative of the Epic, at that narrative"
6879,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,itself is interspersed in the midst of more lengthy episodes. The
6880,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"more carefully I examined the arrangement, the more clearly it"
6881,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,appeared to me that these main incidents of the Epic would bear a
6882,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,full and unabridged translation into English verse; and that these
6883,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"translations, linked together by short connecting notes, would"
6884,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,virtually present the entire story of the Epic to the modern reader in
6885,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"a form and within limits which might be acceptable. It would be, no"
6886,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"doubt, a condensed version of the original Epic, but the condensation"
6887,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"would be effected, not by the translator telling a short story in his"
6888,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"own language, but by linking together those passages of the original"
6889,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"which describe the main and striking incidents, and thus telling"
6890,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,the main story as told in the original work. The advantage of this
6891,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"arrangement is that, in the passages presented to the reader, it is"
6892,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the poet who speaks to him, not the translator. Though vast portions"
6893,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"of the original are skipped over, those which are presented are the"
6894,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"portions which narrate the main incidents of the Epic, and they"
6895,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,describe those incidents as told by the poet himself.
6896,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6897,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,This is the plan I have generally adopted in the present work. Except
6898,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"in the three books which describe the actual war (Books viii., ix.,"
6899,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"and x.), the other nine books of this translation are complete"
6900,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,translations of selected passages of the original work. I have not
6901,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,attempted to condense these passages nor to expand them; I have
6902,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,endeavoured to put them before the English reader as they have
6903,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"been told by the poet in Sanscrit. Occasionally, but rarely, a few"
6904,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"redundant couplets have been left out, or a long list of proper names"
6905,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"or obscure allusions has been shortened; and in one place only, at"
6906,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the beginning of the Fifth Book, I have added twelve couplets of my"
6907,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,own to explain the circumstances under which the story of Savitri is
6908,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"told. Generally, therefore, the translation may be accepted as an"
6909,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"unabridged, though necessarily a free translation of the passages"
6910,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,describing the main incidents of the Epic.
6911,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6912,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"From this method I have been compelled to depart, much against my"
6913,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"wish, in the three books describing the actual war. No translation"
6914,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,of an Epic relating to a great war can be acceptable which does not
6915,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,narrate the main events of the war. The war of the _Maha-bharata_
6916,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"was a series of eighteen battles, fought on eighteen consecutive"
6917,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"days, and I felt it necessary to present the reader with an account"
6918,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"of each day's work. In order to do so, I have been compelled to"
6919,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"condense, and not merely to translate selected passages. For the"
6920,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"transactions of the war, unlike the other incidents of the Epic, have"
6921,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,been narrated in the original with almost inconceivable prolixity and
6922,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,endless repetition; and the process of condensation in these three
6923,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"books has therefore been severe and thorough. But, nevertheless, even"
6924,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,in these books I have endeavoured to preserve the character and the
6925,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,spirit of the original. Not only are the incidents narrated in the
6926,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"same order as in the original, but they are told in the style of the"
6927,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,poet as far as possible. Even the similes and metaphors and figures
6928,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,of speech are all or mostly adopted from the original; the translator
6929,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"has not ventured either to adopt his own distinct style of narration,"
6930,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,or to improve on the style of the original with his own decorations.
6931,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6932,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,Such is the scheme I have adopted in presenting an Epic of ninety
6933,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,thousand Sanscrit couplets in about two thousand English couplets.
6934,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6935,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,The excellent and deservedly popular prose translation of the Odyssey
6936,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,of Homer by Messrs. Butcher and Lang often led me to think that
6937,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,perhaps a prose translation of these selected passages from the
6938,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,_Maha-bharata_ might be more acceptable to the modern reader. But a
6939,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,more serious consideration of the question dispelled that idea. Homer
6940,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,has an interest for the European reader which the _Maha-bharata_
6941,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,cannot lay claim to; as the father of European poetry he has a claim
6942,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,on the veneration of modern Europe which an Indian poet can never
6943,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,pretend to. To thousands of European readers Homer is familiar
6944,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"in the original, to hundreds of thousands he is known in various"
6945,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"translations in various modern languages. What Homer actually wrote,"
6946,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,a numerous class of students in Europe wish to know; and a literal
6947,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"prose translation therefore is welcome, after the great Epic has been"
6948,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,so often translated in verse. The case is very different with the
6949,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"_Maha-bharata_, practically unknown to European readers. And the"
6950,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"translators of Homer themselves gracefully acknowledge, ""We have"
6951,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"tried to transfer, not all the truth about the poem, but the"
6952,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,historical truth into English. In this process Homer must lose at
6953,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"least half his charm, his bright and equable speed, the musical"
6954,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"current of that narrative, which, like the river of Egypt, flows from"
6955,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"an undiscoverable source, and mirrors the temples and the palaces of"
6956,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"unforgotten gods and kings. Without the music of verse, only a half"
6957,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"truth about Homer can be told."""
6958,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6959,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"Another earnest worker of the present day, who is endeavouring to"
6960,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,interpret to modern Englishmen the thoughts and sentiments and poetry
6961,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"of their Anglo-Saxon ancestors, has emphatically declared that ""of"
6962,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"all possible translations of poetry, a merely prose translation is"
6963,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the most inaccurate."" ""Prose,"" says Mr. Stopford Brooke, further on,"
6964,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"""no more represents poetry than architecture does music. Translations"
6965,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"of poetry are never much good, but at least they should always"
6966,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"endeavour to have the musical movement of poetry, and to obey the"
6967,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"laws of the verse they translate."""
6968,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6969,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,This appears to me to be a very sound maxim. And one of my greatest
6970,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,difficulties in the task I have undertaken has been to try and
6971,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"preserve something of the ""musical movement"" of the sonorous Sanscrit"
6972,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,poetry in the English translation. Much of tile Sanscrit Epic is
6973,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,written in the well-known _Sloka_ metre of sixteen syllables in each
6974,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"line, and I endeavoured to choose some English metre which is"
6975,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"familiar to the English ear, and which would reproduce to some extent"
6976,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the rhythm, the majesty, and the long and measured sweep of the"
6977,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,Sanscrit verse. It was necessary to adopt such a metre in order to
6978,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,transfer something of the truth about the _Maha-bharata_ into
6979,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"English, for without such reproduction or imitation of the musical"
6980,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,movement of the original very much less than a half truth is told.
6981,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"My kind friend Mr. Edmund Russell, impelled by that enthusiasm for"
6982,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"Indian poetry and Indian art which is a part of him, rendered me"
6983,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"valuable help and assistance in this matter, and I gratefully"
6984,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"acknowledge, the benefit I have derived from his advice and"
6985,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"suggestions. After considerable trouble and anxiety, and after"
6986,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"rendering several books in different English metres, I felt convinced"
6987,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,that the one finally adopted was a nearer approach to the Sanscrit
6988,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,_Sloka_ than any other familiar English metre known to me.
6989,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
6990,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,I have recited a verse in this English metre and a _Sloka_ in
6991,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"presence of listeners who have a better ear for music than myself,"
6992,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,and they have marked the close resemblance. I quote a few lines from
6993,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the Sanscrit showing varieties of the _Sloka_ metre, and comparing"
6994,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,them with the scheme of the English metre selected.

7036,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,It would be too much to assume that even with the help of this
7037,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"similarity in metres, I have been able to transfer into my English"
7038,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"that sweep and majesty of verse which is the charm of Sanscrit, and"
7039,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,which often sustains and elevates the simplest narration and the
7040,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"plainest ideas. Without the support of those sustaining wings, my"
7041,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,poor narration must often plod through the dust; and I can only ask
7042,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"for the indulgence of the reader, which every translator of poetry"
7043,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"from a foreign language can with reason ask, if the story as told"
7044,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"in the translation is sometimes but a plain, simple, and homely"
7045,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,narrative. For any artistic decoration I have neither the inclination
7046,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"nor the necessary qualification. The crisp and ornate style, the"
7047,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"quaint expression, the chiselled word, the new-coined phrase,"
7048,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"in which modern English poetry is rich, would scarcely suit the"
7049,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,translation of an old Epic whose predominating characteristic is
7050,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"its simple and easy flow of narrative. Indeed, the _Maha-bharata_"
7051,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,would lose that unadorned simplicity which is its first and foremost
7052,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,feature if the translator ventured to decorate it with the art of
7053,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the modern day, even if he had been qualified to do so."
7054,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
7055,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,For if there is one characteristic feature which distinguishes the
7056,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"_Maha-bharata_ (as well as the other Indian Epic, the _Ramayana_)"
7057,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"from all later Sanscrit literature, it is the grand simplicity of"
7058,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"its narrative, which contrasts with the artificial graces of later"
7059,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"Sanscrit poetry. The poetry of Kalidasa, for instance, is ornate and"
7060,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"beautiful, and almost scintillates with similes in every verse; the"
7061,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"poetry of the _Maha-bharara_ is plain and unpolished, and scarcely"
7062,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,stoops to a simile or a figure of speech unless the simile comes
7063,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,naturally to the poet. The great deeds of godlike kings sometimes
7064,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,suggest to the poet the mighty deeds of gods; the rushing of warriors
7065,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,suggests the rushing of angry elephants in the echoing jungle; the
7066,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,flight of whistling arrows suggests the flight of sea-birds; the
7067,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,sound and movement of surging crowds suggest the heaving of billows;
7068,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,the erect attitude of a warrior suggests a tall cliff; the beauty
7069,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,of a maiden suggests the soft beauty of the blue lotus. When such
7070,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"comparisons come naturally to the poet, he accepts them and notes"
7071,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"them down, but he never seems to go in quest of them, he is never"
7072,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,anxious to beautify and decorate. He seems to trust entirely to his
7073,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"grand narrative, to his heroic characters, to his stirring incidents,"
7074,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,to hold millions of listeners in perpetual thrall. The majestic and
7075,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"sonorous Sanscrit metre is at his command, and even this he uses,"
7076,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"carelessly, and with frequent slips, known as _arsha_ to later"
7077,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,grammarians. The poet certainly seeks for no art to decorate his
7078,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"tale, he trusts to the lofty chronicle of bygone heroes to enchain"
7079,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,the listening mankind.
7080,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
7081,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,And what heroes! In the delineation of character the _Maha-bharata_
7082,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"is far above anything which we find in later Sanscrit poetry. Indeed,"
7083,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,with much that is fresh and sweet and lovely in later Sanscrit
7084,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"poetry, there is little or no portraiture of character. All heroes"
7085,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,are cast much in the same heroic mould; all love-sick heroines suffer
7086,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"in silence and burn with fever, all fools are shrewd and impudent"
7087,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"by turns, all knaves are heartless and cruel and suffer in the end."
7088,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"There is not much to distinguish between one warrior and another,"
7089,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,between one tender woman and her sister. In the _Maha-bharata_ we
7090,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"find just the reverse; each hero has a distinct individuality, a"
7091,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"character of his own, clearly discernible from that of other heroes."
7092,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"No work of the imagination that could be named, always excepting"
7093,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the Iliad, is so rich and so true as the _Maha-bharata_ in the"
7094,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"portraiture of the human character,--not in torment and suffering as"
7095,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"in Dante, not under overwhelming passions as in Shakespeare,--but"
7096,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"human character in its calm dignity of strength and repose, like"
7097,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"those immortal figures in marble which the ancients turned out, and"
7098,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,which modern sculptors have vainly sought to reproduce. The old Kuru
7099,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"monarch Dhrita-rashtra, sightless and feeble, but majestic in his"
7100,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"ancient grandeur; the noble grandsire Bhishma, ""death's subduer"""
7101,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"and unconquerable in war; the doughty Drona, venerable priest and"
7102,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,vengeful warrior; and the proud and peerless archer Karna--have each a
7103,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,distinct character of his own which can not be mistaken for a moment.
7104,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"The good and royal Yudhishthir, (I omit the final _a_ in some long"
7105,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"names which occur frequently), the ""tiger-waisted"" Bhima, and the"
7106,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"""helmet-wearing"" Arjun are the Agamemnon, the Ajax, and the Achilles"
7107,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"of the Indian Epic. The proud and unyielding Duryodhan, and the"
7108,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,fierce and fiery Duhsasan stand out foremost among the wrathful sons
7109,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,of the feeble old Kuru monarch. And Krishna possesses a character
7110,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"higher than that of Ulysses; unmatched in human wisdom, ever striving"
7111,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"for righteousness and peace, he is thorough and unrelenting in"
7112,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,war when war has begun. And the women of the Indian Epic possess
7113,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,characters as marked as those of the men. The stately and majestic
7114,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"queen Gandhari, the loving and doting mother Pritha, the proud and"
7115,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,scornful Draupadi nursing her wrath till her wrongs are fearfully
7116,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"revenged, and the bright and brilliant and sunny Subhadra,--these are"
7117,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,distinct images pencilled by the hand of a true master in the realm
7118,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,of creative imagination.
7119,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
7120,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,And if the characters of the _Maha-bharata_ impress themselves on
7121,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the reader, the incidents of the Epic are no less striking. Every"
7122,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,scene on the shifting stage is a perfect and impressive picture. The
7123,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,tournament of the princes in which Arjun and Karna--the Achilles and
7124,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,Hector of the Indian Epic--first met and each marked the other for his
7125,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,foe; the gorgeous bridal of Draupadi; the equally gorgeous coronation
7126,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,of Yudhishthir and the death of the proud and boisterous Sisupala;
7127,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,the fatal game of dice and the scornful wrath of Draupadi against her
7128,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,insulters; the calm beauty of the forest life of the Pandavs; the
7129,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,cattle-lifting in Matsyaland in which the gallant Arjun threw off his
7130,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,disguise and stood forth as warrior and conqueror; and the Homeric
7131,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,speeches of the warriors in the council of war on the eve of the
7132,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"great contest,--each scene of this venerable old Epic impresses"
7133,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,itself on the mind of the hushed and astonished reader. Then follows
7134,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,the war of eighteen days. The first few days are more or less
7135,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"uneventful, and have been condensed in this translation often into"
7136,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,a few couplets; but the interest of the reader increases as he
7137,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,approaches the final battle and fall of the grand old fighter
7138,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,Bhishma. Then follows the stirring story of the death of Arjun's
7139,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"gallant boy, and Arjun's fierce revenge, and the death of the priest"
7140,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"and warrior, doughty Drona. Last comes the crowning event of the"
7141,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"Epic, the final contest between Arjun and Karna, the heroes of the"
7142,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"Epic, and the war ends in a midnight slaughter and the death of"
7143,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,Duryodhan. The rest of the story is told in this translation in
7144,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"two books describing the funerals of the deceased warriors, and"
7145,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,Yudhishthir's horse-sacrifice.
7146,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,
7147,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"""The poems of Homer,"" says Mr. Gladstone, ""differ from all other"
7148,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"known poetry in this, that they constitute in themselves an"
7149,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"encyclopædia of life and knowledge; at a time when knowledge,"
7150,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"indeed, such as lies beyond the bounds of actual experience, was"
7151,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"extremely limited, and when life was singularly fresh, vivid, and"
7152,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"expansive."" This remark applies with even greater force to the"
7153,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,_Maha-bharata_; it is an encyclopædia of the life and knowledge
7154,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,of Ancient India. And it discloses to us an ancient and forgotten
7155,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"world, a proud and noble civilisation which has passed away. Northern"
7156,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,India was then parcelled among warlike races living side by side
7157,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"under their warlike kings, speaking the same language, performing"
7158,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the same religious rites and ceremonies, rejoicing in a common"
7159,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"literature, rivalling each other in their schools of philosophy and"
7160,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"learning as in the arts of peace and civilisation, and forming a"
7161,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,confederation of Hindu nations unknown to and unknowing the outside
7162,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,world. What this confederation of nations has done for the cause of
7163,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,human knowledge and human civilisation is a matter of history. Their
7164,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"inquiries into the hidden truths of religion, embalmed in the ancient"
7165,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"_Upanishads_, have never been excelled within the last three thousand"
7166,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"years. Their inquiries into philosophy, preserved in the _Sankhya_"
7167,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"and the _Vedanta_ systems, were the first systems of true philosophy"
7168,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"which the world produced. And their great works of imagination, the"
7169,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"_Maha-bharata_ and the _Ramayana_, will be placed without hesitation"
7170,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,by the side of Homer by critics who survey the world's literatures
7171,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"from a lofty standpoint, and judge impartially of the wares turned"
7172,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,out by the hand of man in all parts of the globe. It is scarcely
7173,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,necessary to add that the discoveries of the ancient Hindus in
7174,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"science, and specially in mathematics, are the heritage of the modern"
7175,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"world; and that the lofty religion of Buddha, proclaimed in India"
7176,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"five centuries before Christ, is now the religion of a third of the"
7177,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"human race. For the rest, the people of modern India know how to"
7178,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,appreciate their ancient heritage. It is not an exaggeration to
7179,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,state that the two hundred millions of Hindus of the present day
7180,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,cherish in their hearts the story of their ancient Epics. The Hindu
7181,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"scarcely lives, man or woman, high or low, educated or ignorant,"
7182,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,whose earliest recollections do not cling round the story and the
7183,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,characters of the great Epics. The almost illiterate oil-manufacturer
7184,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,or confectioner of Bengal spells out some modern translation of the
7185,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,Maha-bharata to while away his leisure hour. The tall and stalwart
7186,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"peasantry of the North-West know of the five Pandav brothers, and of"
7187,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,their friend the righteous Krishna. The people of Bombay and Madras
7188,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,cherish with equal ardour the story of the righteous war. And even
7189,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the traditions and tales interspersed in the Epic, and which spoil"
7190,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"the work as an Epic, have themselves a charm and an attraction;"
7191,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,and the morals inculcated in these tales sink into the hearts of
7192,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"a naturally religious people, and form the basis of their moral"
7193,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,education. Mothers in India know no better theme for imparting wisdom
7194,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"and instruction to their daughters, and elderly men know no richer"
7195,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"storehouse for narrating tales to children, than these stories"
7196,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"preserved in the Epics. No work in Europe, not Homer in Greece or"
7197,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,"Virgil in Italy, not Shakespeare or Milton in English-speaking lands,"
7198,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,is the national property of the nations to the same extent as the
7199,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,Epics of India are of the Hindus. No single work except the Bible has
7200,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,such influence in affording moral instruction in Christian lands as
7201,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,the _Maha-bharata_ and the _Ramayana_ in India. They have been the
7202,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,cherished heritage of the Hindus for three thousand years; they are
7203,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,to the present day interwoven with the thoughts and beliefs and moral
7204,TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE,ideas of a nation numbering two hundred millions.
