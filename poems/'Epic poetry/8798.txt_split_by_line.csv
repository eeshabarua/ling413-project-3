34,CANTO XXII,
35,CANTO XXII,"Astounded, to the guardian of my steps"
36,CANTO XXII,"I turn'd me, like the chill, who always runs"
37,CANTO XXII,"Thither for succour, where he trusteth most,"
38,CANTO XXII,"And she was like the mother, who her son"
39,CANTO XXII,"Beholding pale and breathless, with her voice"
40,CANTO XXII,"Soothes him, and he is cheer'd; for thus she spake,"
41,CANTO XXII,"Soothing me: ""Know'st not thou, thou art in heav'n?"
42,CANTO XXII,"And know'st not thou, whatever is in heav'n,"
43,CANTO XXII,"Is holy, and that nothing there is done"
44,CANTO XXII,"But is done zealously and well?  Deem now,"
45,CANTO XXII,"What change in thee the song, and what my smile"
46,CANTO XXII,"had wrought, since thus the shout had pow'r to move thee."
47,CANTO XXII,"In which couldst thou have understood their prayers,"
48,CANTO XXII,"The vengeance were already known to thee,"
49,CANTO XXII,"Which thou must witness ere thy mortal hour,"
50,CANTO XXII,"The sword of heav'n is not in haste to smite,"
51,CANTO XXII,"Nor yet doth linger, save unto his seeming,"
52,CANTO XXII,Who in desire or fear doth look for it.
53,CANTO XXII,But elsewhere now l bid thee turn thy view;
54,CANTO XXII,"So shalt thou many a famous spirit behold."""
55,CANTO XXII,"Mine eyes directing, as she will'd, I saw"
56,CANTO XXII,"A hundred little spheres, that fairer grew"
57,CANTO XXII,"By interchange of splendour.  I remain'd,"
58,CANTO XXII,"As one, who fearful of o'er-much presuming,"
59,CANTO XXII,"Abates in him the keenness of desire,"
60,CANTO XXII,"Nor dares to question, when amid those pearls,"
61,CANTO XXII,"One largest and most lustrous onward drew,"
62,CANTO XXII,That it might yield contentment to my wish;
63,CANTO XXII,And from within it these the sounds I heard.
64,CANTO XXII,
65,CANTO XXII,"""If thou, like me, beheldst the charity"
66,CANTO XXII,"That burns amongst us, what thy mind conceives,"
67,CANTO XXII,"Were utter'd.  But that, ere the lofty bound"
68,CANTO XXII,"Thou reach, expectance may not weary thee,"
69,CANTO XXII,"I will make answer even to the thought,"
70,CANTO XXII,"Which thou hast such respect of.  In old days,"
71,CANTO XXII,"That mountain, at whose side Cassino rests,"
72,CANTO XXII,Was on its height frequented by a race
73,CANTO XXII,"Deceived and ill dispos'd: and I it was,"
74,CANTO XXII,"Who thither carried first the name of Him,"
75,CANTO XXII,Who brought the soul-subliming truth to man.
76,CANTO XXII,"And such a speeding grace shone over me,"
77,CANTO XXII,That from their impious worship I reclaim'd
78,CANTO XXII,"The dwellers round about, who with the world"
79,CANTO XXII,"Were in delusion lost.  These other flames,"
80,CANTO XXII,"The spirits of men contemplative, were all"
81,CANTO XXII,"Enliven'd by that warmth, whose kindly force"
82,CANTO XXII,Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness.
83,CANTO XXII,Here is Macarius; Romoaldo here:
84,CANTO XXII,"And here my brethren, who their steps refrain'd"
85,CANTO XXII,"Within the cloisters, and held firm their heart."""
86,CANTO XXII,
87,CANTO XXII,"I answ'ring, thus; ""Thy gentle words and kind,"
88,CANTO XXII,"And this the cheerful semblance, I behold"
89,CANTO XXII,"Not unobservant, beaming in ye all,"
90,CANTO XXII,"Have rais'd assurance in me, wakening it"
91,CANTO XXII,"Full-blossom'd in my bosom, as a rose"
92,CANTO XXII,"Before the sun, when the consummate flower"
93,CANTO XXII,Has spread to utmost amplitude.  Of thee
94,CANTO XXII,"Therefore entreat I, father! to declare"
95,CANTO XXII,"If I may gain such favour, as to gaze"
96,CANTO XXII,"Upon thine image, by no covering veil'd."""
97,CANTO XXII,
98,CANTO XXII,"""Brother!""  he thus rejoin'd, ""in the last sphere"
99,CANTO XXII,"Expect completion of thy lofty aim,"
100,CANTO XXII,"For there on each desire completion waits,"
101,CANTO XXII,And there on mine: where every aim is found
102,CANTO XXII,"Perfect, entire, and for fulfillment ripe."
103,CANTO XXII,There all things are as they have ever been:
104,CANTO XXII,"For space is none to bound, nor pole divides,"
105,CANTO XXII,"Our ladder reaches even to that clime,"
106,CANTO XXII,And so at giddy distance mocks thy view.
107,CANTO XXII,Thither the Patriarch Jacob saw it stretch
108,CANTO XXII,"Its topmost round, when it appear'd to him"
109,CANTO XXII,With angels laden.  But to mount it now
110,CANTO XXII,None lifts his foot from earth: and hence my rule
111,CANTO XXII,Is left a profitless stain upon the leaves;
112,CANTO XXII,"The walls, for abbey rear'd, turned into dens,"
113,CANTO XXII,The cowls to sacks choak'd up with musty meal.
114,CANTO XXII,Foul usury doth not more lift itself
115,CANTO XXII,"Against God's pleasure, than that fruit which makes"
116,CANTO XXII,The hearts of monks so wanton: for whate'er
117,CANTO XXII,"Is in the church's keeping, all pertains."
118,CANTO XXII,"To such, as sue for heav'n's sweet sake, and not"
119,CANTO XXII,"To those who in respect of kindred claim,"
120,CANTO XXII,Or on more vile allowance.  Mortal flesh
121,CANTO XXII,"Is grown so dainty, good beginnings last not"
122,CANTO XXII,"From the oak's birth, unto the acorn's setting."
123,CANTO XXII,His convent Peter founded without gold
124,CANTO XXII,Or silver; I with pray'rs and fasting mine;
125,CANTO XXII,And Francis his in meek humility.
126,CANTO XXII,"And if thou note the point, whence each proceeds,"
127,CANTO XXII,"Then look what it hath err'd to, thou shalt find"
128,CANTO XXII,The white grown murky.  Jordan was turn'd back;
129,CANTO XXII,"And a less wonder, then the refluent sea,"
130,CANTO XXII,"May at God's pleasure work amendment here."""
131,CANTO XXII,
132,CANTO XXII,"So saying, to his assembly back he drew:"
133,CANTO XXII,"And they together cluster'd into one,"
134,CANTO XXII,Then all roll'd upward like an eddying wind.
135,CANTO XXII,
136,CANTO XXII,The sweet dame beckon'd me to follow them:
137,CANTO XXII,"And, by that influence only, so prevail'd"
138,CANTO XXII,"Over my nature, that no natural motion,"
139,CANTO XXII,"Ascending or descending here below,"
140,CANTO XXII,"Had, as I mounted, with my pennon vied."
141,CANTO XXII,
142,CANTO XXII,"So, reader, as my hope is to return"
143,CANTO XXII,"Unto the holy triumph, for the which"
144,CANTO XXII,"I ofttimes wail my sins, and smite my breast,"
145,CANTO XXII,Thou hadst been longer drawing out and thrusting
146,CANTO XXII,"Thy finger in the fire, than I was, ere"
147,CANTO XXII,"The sign, that followeth Taurus, I beheld,"
148,CANTO XXII,And enter'd its precinct.  O glorious stars!
149,CANTO XXII,O light impregnate with exceeding virtue!
150,CANTO XXII,To whom whate'er of genius lifteth me
151,CANTO XXII,"Above the vulgar, grateful I refer;"
152,CANTO XXII,With ye the parent of all mortal life
153,CANTO XXII,"Arose and set, when I did first inhale"
154,CANTO XXII,"The Tuscan air; and afterward, when grace"
155,CANTO XXII,Vouchsaf'd me entrance to the lofty wheel
156,CANTO XXII,"That in its orb impels ye, fate decreed"
157,CANTO XXII,My passage at your clime.  To you my soul
158,CANTO XXII,"Devoutly sighs, for virtue even now"
159,CANTO XXII,To meet the hard emprize that draws me on.
160,CANTO XXII,
161,CANTO XXII,"""Thou art so near the sum of blessedness,"""
162,CANTO XXII,"Said Beatrice, ""that behooves thy ken"
163,CANTO XXII,"Be vigilant and clear.  And, to this end,"
164,CANTO XXII,"Or even thou advance thee further, hence"
165,CANTO XXII,"Look downward, and contemplate, what a world"
166,CANTO XXII,Already stretched under our feet there lies:
167,CANTO XXII,"So as thy heart may, in its blithest mood,"
168,CANTO XXII,"Present itself to the triumphal throng,"
169,CANTO XXII,"Which through the' etherial concave comes rejoicing."""
170,CANTO XXII,
171,CANTO XXII,I straight obey'd; and with mine eye return'd
172,CANTO XXII,"Through all the seven spheres, and saw this globe"
173,CANTO XXII,"So pitiful of semblance, that perforce"
174,CANTO XXII,It moved my smiles: and him in truth I hold
175,CANTO XXII,"For wisest, who esteems it least: whose thoughts"
176,CANTO XXII,"Elsewhere are fix'd, him worthiest call and best."
177,CANTO XXII,I saw the daughter of Latona shine
178,CANTO XXII,"Without the shadow, whereof late I deem'd"
179,CANTO XXII,That dense and rare were cause.  Here I sustain'd
180,CANTO XXII,"The visage, Hyperion! of thy sun;"
181,CANTO XXII,"And mark'd, how near him with their circle, round"
182,CANTO XXII,Move Maia and Dione; here discern'd
183,CANTO XXII,Jove's tempering 'twixt his sire and son; and hence
184,CANTO XXII,Their changes and their various aspects
185,CANTO XXII,Distinctly scann'd.  Nor might I not descry
186,CANTO XXII,"Of all the seven, how bulky each, how swift;"
187,CANTO XXII,Nor of their several distances not learn.
188,CANTO XXII,This petty area (o'er the which we stride
189,CANTO XXII,"So fiercely), as along the eternal twins"
190,CANTO XXII,"I wound my way, appear'd before me all,"
191,CANTO XXII,Forth from the havens stretch'd unto the hills.
192,CANTO XXII,Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes return'd.
193,CANTO XXII,
194,CANTO XXII,
195,CANTO XXII,
196,CANTO XXII,
197,CANTO XXIII,CANTO XXIII
198,CANTO XXIII,
199,CANTO XXIII,"E'en as the bird, who midst the leafy bower"
200,CANTO XXIII,"Has, in her nest, sat darkling through the night,"
201,CANTO XXIII,"With her sweet brood, impatient to descry"
202,CANTO XXIII,"Their wished looks, and to bring home their food,"
203,CANTO XXIII,In the fond quest unconscious of her toil:
204,CANTO XXIII,"She, of the time prevenient, on the spray,"
205,CANTO XXIII,"That overhangs their couch, with wakeful gaze"
206,CANTO XXIII,"Expects the sun; nor ever, till the dawn,"
207,CANTO XXIII,Removeth from the east her eager ken;
208,CANTO XXIII,"So stood the dame erect, and bent her glance"
209,CANTO XXIII,"Wistfully on that region, where the sun"
210,CANTO XXIII,"Abateth most his speed; that, seeing her"
211,CANTO XXIII,"Suspense and wand'ring, I became as one,"
212,CANTO XXIII,"In whom desire is waken'd, and the hope"
213,CANTO XXIII,Of somewhat new to come fills with delight.
214,CANTO XXIII,
215,CANTO XXIII,"Short space ensued; I was not held, I say,"
216,CANTO XXIII,"Long in expectance, when I saw the heav'n"
217,CANTO XXIII,"Wax more and more resplendent; and, ""Behold,"""
218,CANTO XXIII,"Cried Beatrice, ""the triumphal hosts"
219,CANTO XXIII,"Of Christ, and all the harvest reap'd at length"
220,CANTO XXIII,"Of thy ascending up these spheres.""  Meseem'd,"
221,CANTO XXIII,"That, while she spake her image all did burn,"
222,CANTO XXIII,"And in her eyes such fullness was of joy,"
223,CANTO XXIII,And I am fain to pass unconstrued by.
224,CANTO XXIII,
225,CANTO XXIII,"As in the calm full moon, when Trivia smiles,"
226,CANTO XXIII,"In peerless beauty, 'mid th' eternal nympus,"
227,CANTO XXIII,That paint through all its gulfs the blue profound
228,CANTO XXIII,"In bright pre-eminence so saw I there,"
229,CANTO XXIII,"O'er million lamps a sun, from whom all drew"
230,CANTO XXIII,Their radiance as from ours the starry train:
231,CANTO XXIII,And through the living light so lustrous glow'd
232,CANTO XXIII,"The substance, that my ken endur'd it not."
233,CANTO XXIII,
234,CANTO XXIII,O Beatrice! sweet and precious guide!
235,CANTO XXIII,Who cheer'd me with her comfortable words!
236,CANTO XXIII,"""Against the virtue, that o'erpow'reth thee,"
237,CANTO XXIII,"Avails not to resist.  Here is the might,"
238,CANTO XXIII,"And here the wisdom, which did open lay"
239,CANTO XXIII,"The path, that had been yearned for so long,"
240,CANTO XXIII,"Betwixt the heav'n and earth.""  Like to the fire,"
241,CANTO XXIII,"That, in a cloud imprison'd doth break out"
242,CANTO XXIII,"Expansive, so that from its womb enlarg'd,"
243,CANTO XXIII,It falleth against nature to the ground;
244,CANTO XXIII,Thus in that heav'nly banqueting my soul
245,CANTO XXIII,"Outgrew herself; and, in the transport lost."
246,CANTO XXIII,Holds now remembrance none of what she was.
247,CANTO XXIII,
248,CANTO XXIII,"""Ope thou thine eyes, and mark me: thou hast seen"
249,CANTO XXIII,"Things, that empower thee to sustain my smile."""
250,CANTO XXIII,
251,CANTO XXIII,"I was as one, when a forgotten dream"
252,CANTO XXIII,"Doth come across him, and he strives in vain"
253,CANTO XXIII,"To shape it in his fantasy again,"
254,CANTO XXIII,"Whenas that gracious boon was proffer'd me,"
255,CANTO XXIII,"Which never may be cancel'd from the book,"
256,CANTO XXIII,Wherein the past is written.  Now were all
257,CANTO XXIII,"Those tongues to sound, that have on sweetest milk"
258,CANTO XXIII,Of Polyhymnia and her sisters fed
259,CANTO XXIII,"And fatten'd, not with all their help to boot,"
260,CANTO XXIII,"Unto the thousandth parcel of the truth,"
261,CANTO XXIII,"My song might shadow forth that saintly smile,"
262,CANTO XXIII,flow merely in her saintly looks it wrought.
263,CANTO XXIII,And with such figuring of Paradise
264,CANTO XXIII,"The sacred strain must leap, like one, that meets"
265,CANTO XXIII,A sudden interruption to his road.
266,CANTO XXIII,"But he, who thinks how ponderous the theme,"
267,CANTO XXIII,"And that 't is lain upon a mortal shoulder,"
268,CANTO XXIII,"May pardon, if it tremble with the burden."
269,CANTO XXIII,"The track, our ventrous keel must furrow, brooks"
270,CANTO XXIII,"No unribb'd pinnace, no self-sparing pilot."
271,CANTO XXIII,
272,CANTO XXIII,"""Why doth my face,"" said Beatrice, ""thus"
273,CANTO XXIII,"Enamour thee, as that thou dost not turn"
274,CANTO XXIII,"Unto the beautiful garden, blossoming"
275,CANTO XXIII,"Beneath the rays of Christ?  Here is the rose,"
276,CANTO XXIII,Wherein the word divine was made incarnate;
277,CANTO XXIII,"And here the lilies, by whose odour known"
278,CANTO XXIII,"The way of life was follow'd.""  Prompt I heard"
279,CANTO XXIII,"Her bidding, and encounter once again"
280,CANTO XXIII,"The strife of aching vision.  As erewhile,"
281,CANTO XXIII,"Through glance of sunlight, stream'd through broken cloud,"
282,CANTO XXIII,"Mine eyes a flower-besprinkled mead have seen,"
283,CANTO XXIII,Though veil'd themselves in shade; so saw I there
284,CANTO XXIII,"Legions of splendours, on whom burning rays"
285,CANTO XXIII,"Shed lightnings from above, yet saw I not"
286,CANTO XXIII,The fountain whence they flow'd.  O gracious virtue!
287,CANTO XXIII,"Thou, whose broad stamp is on them, higher up"
288,CANTO XXIII,Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room
289,CANTO XXIII,To my o'erlabour'd sight: when at the name
290,CANTO XXIII,"Of that fair flower, whom duly I invoke"
291,CANTO XXIII,"Both morn and eve, my soul, with all her might"
292,CANTO XXIII,"Collected, on the goodliest ardour fix'd."
293,CANTO XXIII,"And, as the bright dimensions of the star"
294,CANTO XXIII,"In heav'n excelling, as once here on earth"
295,CANTO XXIII,"Were, in my eyeballs lively portray'd,"
296,CANTO XXIII,"Lo! from within the sky a cresset fell,"
297,CANTO XXIII,"Circling in fashion of a diadem,"
298,CANTO XXIII,"And girt the star, and hov'ring round it wheel'd."
299,CANTO XXIII,
300,CANTO XXIII,"Whatever melody sounds sweetest here,"
301,CANTO XXIII,"And draws the spirit most unto itself,"
302,CANTO XXIII,"Might seem a rent cloud when it grates the thunder,"
303,CANTO XXIII,"Compar'd unto the sounding of that lyre,"
304,CANTO XXIII,"Wherewith the goodliest sapphire, that inlays"
305,CANTO XXIII,"The floor of heav'n, was crown'd. ""Angelic Love"
306,CANTO XXIII,"I am, who thus with hov'ring flight enwheel"
307,CANTO XXIII,"The lofty rapture from that womb inspir'd,"
308,CANTO XXIII,"Where our desire did dwell: and round thee so,"
309,CANTO XXIII,Lady of Heav'n! will hover; long as thou
310,CANTO XXIII,"Thy Son shalt follow, and diviner joy"
311,CANTO XXIII,"Shall from thy presence gild the highest sphere."""
312,CANTO XXIII,
313,CANTO XXIII,Such close was to the circling melody:
314,CANTO XXIII,"And, as it ended, all the other lights"
315,CANTO XXIII,"Took up the strain, and echoed Mary's name."
316,CANTO XXIII,
317,CANTO XXIII,"The robe, that with its regal folds enwraps"
318,CANTO XXIII,"The world, and with the nearer breath of God"
319,CANTO XXIII,"Doth burn and quiver, held so far retir'd"
320,CANTO XXIII,"Its inner hem and skirting over us,"
321,CANTO XXIII,That yet no glimmer of its majesty
322,CANTO XXIII,Had stream'd unto me: therefore were mine eyes
323,CANTO XXIII,"Unequal to pursue the crowned flame,"
324,CANTO XXIII,That rose and sought its natal seed of fire;
325,CANTO XXIII,"And like to babe, that stretches forth its arms"
326,CANTO XXIII,"For very eagerness towards the breast,"
327,CANTO XXIII,After the milk is taken; so outstretch'd
328,CANTO XXIII,"Their wavy summits all the fervent band,"
329,CANTO XXIII,Through zealous love to Mary: then in view
330,CANTO XXIII,"There halted, and ""Regina Coeli"" sang"
331,CANTO XXIII,"So sweetly, the delight hath left me never."
332,CANTO XXIII,
333,CANTO XXIII,O what o'erflowing plenty is up-pil'd
334,CANTO XXIII,"In those rich-laden coffers, which below"
335,CANTO XXIII,"Sow'd the good seed, whose harvest now they keep."
336,CANTO XXIII,
337,CANTO XXIII,"Here are the treasures tasted, that with tears"
338,CANTO XXIII,"Were in the Babylonian exile won,"
339,CANTO XXIII,When gold had fail'd them.  Here in synod high
340,CANTO XXIII,"Of ancient council with the new conven'd,"
341,CANTO XXIII,"Under the Son of Mary and of God,"
342,CANTO XXIII,"Victorious he his mighty triumph holds,"
343,CANTO XXIII,To whom the keys of glory were assign'd.
344,CANTO XXIII,
345,CANTO XXIII,
346,CANTO XXIII,
347,CANTO XXIII,
348,CANTO XXIV,CANTO XXIV
349,CANTO XXIV,
350,CANTO XXIV,"""O ye! in chosen fellowship advanc'd"
351,CANTO XXIV,"To the great supper of the blessed Lamb,"
352,CANTO XXIV,Whereon who feeds hath every wish fulfill'd!
353,CANTO XXIV,If to this man through God's grace be vouchsaf'd
354,CANTO XXIV,"Foretaste of that, which from your table falls,"
355,CANTO XXIV,Or ever death his fated term prescribe;
356,CANTO XXIV,Be ye not heedless of his urgent will;
357,CANTO XXIV,But may some influence of your sacred dews
358,CANTO XXIV,"Sprinkle him.  Of the fount ye alway drink,"
359,CANTO XXIV,"Whence flows what most he craves.""  Beatrice spake,"
360,CANTO XXIV,"And the rejoicing spirits, like to spheres"
361,CANTO XXIV,"On firm-set poles revolving, trail'd a blaze"
362,CANTO XXIV,"Of comet splendour; and as wheels, that wind"
363,CANTO XXIV,"Their circles in the horologe, so work"
364,CANTO XXIV,"The stated rounds, that to th' observant eye"
365,CANTO XXIV,"The first seems still, and, as it flew, the last;"
366,CANTO XXIV,"E'en thus their carols weaving variously,"
367,CANTO XXIV,"They by the measure pac'd, or swift, or slow,"
368,CANTO XXIV,Made me to rate the riches of their joy.
369,CANTO XXIV,
370,CANTO XXIV,"From that, which I did note in beauty most"
371,CANTO XXIV,"Excelling, saw I issue forth a flame"
372,CANTO XXIV,"So bright, as none was left more goodly there."
373,CANTO XXIV,"Round Beatrice thrice it wheel'd about,"
374,CANTO XXIV,"With so divine a song, that fancy's ear"
375,CANTO XXIV,Records it not; and the pen passeth on
376,CANTO XXIV,"And leaves a blank: for that our mortal speech,"
377,CANTO XXIV,"Nor e'en the inward shaping of the brain,"
378,CANTO XXIV,Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds.
379,CANTO XXIV,
380,CANTO XXIV,"""O saintly sister mine! thy prayer devout"
381,CANTO XXIV,"Is with so vehement affection urg'd,"
382,CANTO XXIV,"Thou dost unbind me from that beauteous sphere."""
383,CANTO XXIV,
384,CANTO XXIV,Such were the accents towards my lady breath'd
385,CANTO XXIV,"From that blest ardour, soon as it was stay'd:"
386,CANTO XXIV,"To whom she thus: ""O everlasting light"
387,CANTO XXIV,"Of him, within whose mighty grasp our Lord"
388,CANTO XXIV,"Did leave the keys, which of this wondrous bliss"
389,CANTO XXIV,"He bare below! tent this man, as thou wilt,"
390,CANTO XXIV,"With lighter probe or deep, touching the faith,"
391,CANTO XXIV,By the which thou didst on the billows walk.
392,CANTO XXIV,"If he in love, in hope, and in belief,"
393,CANTO XXIV,"Be steadfast, is not hid from thee: for thou"
394,CANTO XXIV,"Hast there thy ken, where all things are beheld"
395,CANTO XXIV,In liveliest portraiture.  But since true faith
396,CANTO XXIV,"Has peopled this fair realm with citizens,"
397,CANTO XXIV,"Meet is, that to exalt its glory more,"
398,CANTO XXIV,"Thou in his audience shouldst thereof discourse."""
399,CANTO XXIV,
400,CANTO XXIV,"Like to the bachelor, who arms himself,"
401,CANTO XXIV,"And speaks not, till the master have propos'd"
402,CANTO XXIV,"The question, to approve, and not to end it;"
403,CANTO XXIV,"So I, in silence, arm'd me, while she spake,"
404,CANTO XXIV,Summoning up each argument to aid;
405,CANTO XXIV,"As was behooveful for such questioner,"
406,CANTO XXIV,"And such profession: ""As good Christian ought,"

1170,CANTO XXIX,"But to receive the grace, which heav'n vouchsafes,"
1171,CANTO XXIX,"Is meritorious, even as the soul"
1172,CANTO XXIX,With prompt affection welcometh the guest.
1173,CANTO XXIX,"Now, without further help, if with good heed"
1174,CANTO XXIX,"My words thy mind have treasur'd, thou henceforth"
1175,CANTO XXIX,"This consistory round about mayst scan,"
1176,CANTO XXIX,And gaze thy fill.  But since thou hast on earth
1177,CANTO XXIX,"Heard vain disputers, reasoners in the schools,"
1178,CANTO XXIX,"Canvas the' angelic nature, and dispute"
1179,CANTO XXIX,"Its powers of apprehension, memory, choice;"
1180,CANTO XXIX,"Therefore, 't is well thou take from me the truth,"
1181,CANTO XXIX,"Pure and without disguise, which they below,"
1182,CANTO XXIX,"Equivocating, darken and perplex."
1183,CANTO XXIX,
1184,CANTO XXIX,"""Know thou, that, from the first, these substances,"
1185,CANTO XXIX,"Rejoicing in the countenance of God,"
1186,CANTO XXIX,"Have held unceasingly their view, intent"
1187,CANTO XXIX,"Upon the glorious vision, from the which"
1188,CANTO XXIX,Naught absent is nor hid: where then no change
1189,CANTO XXIX,"Of newness with succession interrupts,"
1190,CANTO XXIX,Remembrance there needs none to gather up
1191,CANTO XXIX,Divided thought and images remote
1192,CANTO XXIX,
1193,CANTO XXIX,"""So that men, thus at variance with the truth"
1194,CANTO XXIX,"Dream, though their eyes be open; reckless some"
1195,CANTO XXIX,"Of error; others well aware they err,"
1196,CANTO XXIX,To whom more guilt and shame are justly due.
1197,CANTO XXIX,Each the known track of sage philosophy
1198,CANTO XXIX,"Deserts, and has a byway of his own:"
1199,CANTO XXIX,So much the restless eagerness to shine
1200,CANTO XXIX,And love of singularity prevail.
1201,CANTO XXIX,"Yet this, offensive as it is, provokes"
1202,CANTO XXIX,"Heav'n's anger less, than when the book of God"
1203,CANTO XXIX,"Is forc'd to yield to man's authority,"
1204,CANTO XXIX,Or from its straightness warp'd: no reck'ning made
1205,CANTO XXIX,What blood the sowing of it in the world
1206,CANTO XXIX,"Has cost; what favour for himself he wins,"
1207,CANTO XXIX,Who meekly clings to it.  The aim of all
1208,CANTO XXIX,"Is how to shine: e'en they, whose office is"
1209,CANTO XXIX,"To preach the Gospel, let the gospel sleep,"
1210,CANTO XXIX,And pass their own inventions off instead.
1211,CANTO XXIX,"One tells, how at Christ's suffering the wan moon"
1212,CANTO XXIX,"Bent back her steps, and shadow'd o'er the sun"
1213,CANTO XXIX,"With intervenient disk, as she withdrew:"
1214,CANTO XXIX,"Another, how the light shrouded itself"
1215,CANTO XXIX,"Within its tabernacle, and left dark"
1216,CANTO XXIX,"The Spaniard and the Indian, with the Jew."
1217,CANTO XXIX,"Such fables Florence in her pulpit hears,"
1218,CANTO XXIX,"Bandied about more frequent, than the names"
1219,CANTO XXIX,Of Bindi and of Lapi in her streets.
1220,CANTO XXIX,"The sheep, meanwhile, poor witless ones, return"
1221,CANTO XXIX,"From pasture, fed with wind: and what avails"
1222,CANTO XXIX,"For their excuse, they do not see their harm?"
1223,CANTO XXIX,"Christ said not to his first conventicle,"
1224,CANTO XXIX,"'Go forth and preach impostures to the world,'"
1225,CANTO XXIX,But gave them truth to build on; and the sound
1226,CANTO XXIX,"Was mighty on their lips; nor needed they,"
1227,CANTO XXIX,"Beside the gospel, other spear or shield,"
1228,CANTO XXIX,To aid them in their warfare for the faith.
1229,CANTO XXIX,The preacher now provides himself with store
1230,CANTO XXIX,"Of jests and gibes; and, so there be no lack"
1231,CANTO XXIX,"Of laughter, while he vents them, his big cowl"
1232,CANTO XXIX,"Distends, and he has won the meed he sought:"
1233,CANTO XXIX,Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while
1234,CANTO XXIX,"Of that dark bird which nestles in his hood,"
1235,CANTO XXIX,They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said.
1236,CANTO XXIX,"Which now the dotards hold in such esteem,"
1237,CANTO XXIX,"That every counterfeit, who spreads abroad"
1238,CANTO XXIX,"The hands of holy promise, finds a throng"
1239,CANTO XXIX,Of credulous fools beneath.  Saint Anthony
1240,CANTO XXIX,"Fattens with this his swine, and others worse"
1241,CANTO XXIX,"Than swine, who diet at his lazy board,"
1242,CANTO XXIX,Paying with unstamp'd metal for their fare.
1243,CANTO XXIX,
1244,CANTO XXIX,"""But (for we far have wander'd) let us seek"
1245,CANTO XXIX,The forward path again; so as the way
1246,CANTO XXIX,Be shorten'd with the time.  No mortal tongue
1247,CANTO XXIX,"Nor thought of man hath ever reach'd so far,"
1248,CANTO XXIX,That of these natures he might count the tribes.
1249,CANTO XXIX,What Daniel of their thousands hath reveal'd
1250,CANTO XXIX,With finite number infinite conceals.
1251,CANTO XXIX,"The fountain at whose source these drink their beams,"
1252,CANTO XXIX,"With light supplies them in as many modes,"
1253,CANTO XXIX,"As there are splendours, that it shines on: each"
1254,CANTO XXIX,"According to the virtue it conceives,"
1255,CANTO XXIX,Differing in love and sweet affection.
1256,CANTO XXIX,Look then how lofty and how huge in breadth
1257,CANTO XXIX,"The' eternal might, which, broken and dispers'd"
1258,CANTO XXIX,"Over such countless mirrors, yet remains"
1259,CANTO XXIX,"Whole in itself and one, as at the first."""

1266,CANTO XXX,Noon's fervid hour perchance six thousand miles
1267,CANTO XXX,From hence is distant; and the shadowy cone
1268,CANTO XXX,Almost to level on our earth declines;
1269,CANTO XXX,When from the midmost of this blue abyss
1270,CANTO XXX,By turns some star is to our vision lost.
1271,CANTO XXX,And straightway as the handmaid of the sun

1273,CANTO XXX,"Fade, and the spangled firmament shuts in,"
1274,CANTO XXX,E'en to the loveliest of the glittering throng.
1275,CANTO XXX,Thus vanish'd gradually from my sight
1276,CANTO XXX,"The triumph, which plays ever round the point,"
1277,CANTO XXX,"That overcame me, seeming (for it did)"
1278,CANTO XXX,"Engirt by that it girdeth.  Wherefore love,"
1279,CANTO XXX,"With loss of other object, forc'd me bend"

1281,CANTO XXX,
1282,CANTO XXX,"If all, that hitherto is told of her,"
1283,CANTO XXX,"Were in one praise concluded, 't were too weak"

1286,CANTO XXX,"Not merely to exceed our human, but,"
1287,CANTO XXX,"That save its Maker, none can to the full"
1288,CANTO XXX,"Enjoy it.  At this point o'erpower'd I fail,"
1289,CANTO XXX,"Unequal to my theme, as never bard"

1297,CANTO XXX,"To follow, but not follow them no more;"
1298,CANTO XXX,"My course here bounded, as each artist's is,"
1299,CANTO XXX,When it doth touch the limit of his skill.

1310,CANTO XXX,"Joy, that transcends all sweetness of delight."
1311,CANTO XXX,Here shalt thou look on either mighty host

1313,CANTO XXX,"Which in the final judgment thou shalt see."""
1314,CANTO XXX,
1315,CANTO XXX,"As when the lightning, in a sudden spleen"
1316,CANTO XXX,"Unfolded, dashes from the blinding eyes"
1317,CANTO XXX,The visive spirits dazzled and bedimm'd;
1318,CANTO XXX,"So, round about me, fulminating streams"
1319,CANTO XXX,"Of living radiance play'd, and left me swath'd"
1320,CANTO XXX,And veil'd in dense impenetrable blaze.

1324,CANTO XXX,No sooner to my list'ning ear had come
1325,CANTO XXX,"The brief assurance, than I understood"
1326,CANTO XXX,"New virtue into me infus'd, and sight"
1327,CANTO XXX,"Kindled afresh, with vigour to sustain"
1328,CANTO XXX,"Excess of light, however pure.  I look'd;"

1331,CANTO XXX,"Flash'd up effulgence, as they glided on"
1332,CANTO XXX,"'Twixt banks, on either side, painted with spring,"
1333,CANTO XXX,"Incredible how fair; and, from the tide,"
1334,CANTO XXX,"There ever and anon, outstarting, flew"
1335,CANTO XXX,Sparkles instinct with life; and in the flow'rs
1336,CANTO XXX,"Did set them, like to rubies chas'd in gold;"
1337,CANTO XXX,"Then, as if drunk with odors, plung'd again"
1338,CANTO XXX,"Into the wondrous flood; from which, as one"
1339,CANTO XXX,"Re'enter'd, still another rose.  ""The thirst"

1346,CANTO XXX,"""This stream, and these, forth issuing from its gulf,"
1347,CANTO XXX,"And diving back, a living topaz each,"
1348,CANTO XXX,"With all this laughter on its bloomy shores,"
1349,CANTO XXX,"Are but a preface, shadowy of the truth"
1350,CANTO XXX,"They emblem: not that, in themselves, the things"
1351,CANTO XXX,"Are crude; but on thy part is the defect,"
1352,CANTO XXX,"For that thy views not yet aspire so high."""
1353,CANTO XXX,"Never did babe, that had outslept his wont,"
1354,CANTO XXX,"Rush, with such eager straining, to the milk,"
1355,CANTO XXX,"As I toward the water, bending me,"
1356,CANTO XXX,To make the better mirrors of mine eyes
1357,CANTO XXX,"In the refining wave; and, as the eaves"
1358,CANTO XXX,"Of mine eyelids did drink of it, forthwith"
1359,CANTO XXX,"Seem'd it unto me turn'd from length to round,"
1360,CANTO XXX,"Then as a troop of maskers, when they put"
1361,CANTO XXX,"Their vizors off, look other than before,"
1362,CANTO XXX,The counterfeited semblance thrown aside;
1363,CANTO XXX,So into greater jubilee were chang'd
1364,CANTO XXX,"Those flowers and sparkles, and distinct I saw"
1365,CANTO XXX,Before me either court of heav'n displac'd.
1366,CANTO XXX,
1367,CANTO XXX,O prime enlightener! thou who crav'st me strength
1368,CANTO XXX,On the high triumph of thy realm to gaze!
1369,CANTO XXX,"Grant virtue now to utter what I kenn'd,"
1370,CANTO XXX,"There is in heav'n a light, whose goodly shine"
1371,CANTO XXX,Makes the Creator visible to all
1372,CANTO XXX,"Created, that in seeing him alone"
1373,CANTO XXX,"Have peace; and in a circle spreads so far,"
1374,CANTO XXX,That the circumference were too loose a zone
1375,CANTO XXX,"To girdle in the sun.  All is one beam,"
1376,CANTO XXX,"Reflected from the summit of the first,"
1377,CANTO XXX,"That moves, which being hence and vigour takes,"
1378,CANTO XXX,"And as some cliff, that from the bottom eyes"
1379,CANTO XXX,"Its image mirror'd in the crystal flood,"
1380,CANTO XXX,As if 't admire its brave appareling
1381,CANTO XXX,"Of verdure and of flowers: so, round about,"
1382,CANTO XXX,"Eyeing the light, on more than million thrones,"
1383,CANTO XXX,"Stood, eminent, whatever from our earth"
1384,CANTO XXX,Has to the skies return'd.  How wide the leaves
1385,CANTO XXX,"Extended to their utmost of this rose,"
1386,CANTO XXX,Whose lowest step embosoms such a space
1387,CANTO XXX,"Of ample radiance!  Yet, nor amplitude"
1388,CANTO XXX,"Nor height impeded, but my view with ease"
1389,CANTO XXX,Took in the full dimensions of that joy.
1390,CANTO XXX,"Near or remote, what there avails, where God"

1392,CANTO XXX,Her sway?  Into the yellow of the rose
1393,CANTO XXX,"Perennial, which in bright expansiveness,"
1394,CANTO XXX,"Lays forth its gradual blooming, redolent"
1395,CANTO XXX,"Of praises to the never-wint'ring sun,"
1396,CANTO XXX,"As one, who fain would speak yet holds his peace,"
1397,CANTO XXX,"Beatrice led me; and, ""Behold,"" she said,"

1413,CANTO XXX,Accordant walk: Whom God will not endure

1538,CANTO XXXI,"As, at the birth of morn, the eastern clime"
1539,CANTO XXXI,"Above th' horizon, where the sun declines;"
1540,CANTO XXXI,"To mine eyes, that upward, as from vale"
1541,CANTO XXXI,"To mountain sped, at th' extreme bound, a part"
1542,CANTO XXXI,Excell'd in lustre all the front oppos'd.
1543,CANTO XXXI,"And as the glow burns ruddiest o'er the wave,"
1544,CANTO XXXI,"That waits the sloping beam, which Phaeton"
1545,CANTO XXXI,"Ill knew to guide, and on each part the light"
1546,CANTO XXXI,"Diminish'd fades, intensest in the midst;"
1547,CANTO XXXI,"So burn'd the peaceful oriflame, and slack'd"
1548,CANTO XXXI,On every side the living flame decay'd.
1549,CANTO XXXI,And in that midst their sportive pennons wav'd
1550,CANTO XXXI,Thousands of angels; in resplendence each
1551,CANTO XXXI,"Distinct, and quaint adornment. At their glee"
1552,CANTO XXXI,"And carol, smil'd the Lovely One of heav'n,"
1553,CANTO XXXI,That joy was in the eyes of all the blest.
1554,CANTO XXXI,
1555,CANTO XXXI,"Had I a tongue in eloquence as rich,"
1556,CANTO XXXI,"As is the colouring in fancy's loom,"
1557,CANTO XXXI,'T were all too poor to utter the least part
1558,CANTO XXXI,Of that enchantment.  When he saw mine eyes
1559,CANTO XXXI,"Intent on her, that charm'd him, Bernard gaz'd"
1560,CANTO XXXI,"With so exceeding fondness, as infus'd"
1561,CANTO XXXI,"Ardour into my breast, unfelt before."

1567,CANTO XXXII,
1568,CANTO XXXII,"Freely the sage, though wrapt in musings high,"
1569,CANTO XXXII,"Assum'd the teacher's part, and mild began:"
1570,CANTO XXXII,"""The wound, that Mary clos'd, she open'd first,"
1571,CANTO XXXII,Who sits so beautiful at Mary's feet.
1572,CANTO XXXII,"The third in order, underneath her, lo!"
1573,CANTO XXXII,"Rachel with Beatrice. Sarah next,"
1574,CANTO XXXII,"Judith, Rebecca, and the gleaner maid,"
1575,CANTO XXXII,"Meek ancestress of him, who sang the songs"
1576,CANTO XXXII,Of sore repentance in his sorrowful mood.
1577,CANTO XXXII,"All, as I name them, down from deaf to leaf,"
1578,CANTO XXXII,Are in gradation throned on the rose.
1579,CANTO XXXII,"And from the seventh step, successively,"
1580,CANTO XXXII,Adown the breathing tresses of the flow'r
1581,CANTO XXXII,Still doth the file of Hebrew dames proceed.
1582,CANTO XXXII,"For these are a partition wall, whereby"
1583,CANTO XXXII,"The sacred stairs are sever'd, as the faith"
1584,CANTO XXXII,"In Christ divides them.  On this part, where blooms"
1585,CANTO XXXII,"Each leaf in full maturity, are set"
1586,CANTO XXXII,"Such as in Christ, or ere he came, believ'd."
1587,CANTO XXXII,"On th' other, where an intersected space"
1588,CANTO XXXII,"Yet shows the semicircle void, abide"
1589,CANTO XXXII,"All they, who look'd to Christ already come."
1590,CANTO XXXII,"And as our Lady on her glorious stool,"
1591,CANTO XXXII,"And they who on their stools beneath her sit,"
1592,CANTO XXXII,"This way distinction make: e'en so on his,"
1593,CANTO XXXII,The mighty Baptist that way marks the line
1594,CANTO XXXII,(He who endur'd the desert and the pains
1595,CANTO XXXII,"Of martyrdom, and for two years of hell,"
1596,CANTO XXXII,"Yet still continued holy), and beneath,"
1597,CANTO XXXII,"Augustin, Francis, Benedict, and the rest,"
1598,CANTO XXXII,Thus far from round to round.  So heav'n's decree
1599,CANTO XXXII,"Forecasts, this garden equally to fill."
1600,CANTO XXXII,"With faith in either view, past or to come,"
1601,CANTO XXXII,"Learn too, that downward from the step, which cleaves"
1602,CANTO XXXII,"Midway the twain compartments, none there are"
1603,CANTO XXXII,"Who place obtain for merit of their own,"
1604,CANTO XXXII,"But have through others' merit been advanc'd,"
1605,CANTO XXXII,"On set conditions: spirits all releas'd,"
1606,CANTO XXXII,Ere for themselves they had the power to choose.
1607,CANTO XXXII,"And, if thou mark and listen to them well,"
1608,CANTO XXXII,Their childish looks and voice declare as much.
1609,CANTO XXXII,
1610,CANTO XXXII,"""Here, silent as thou art, I know thy doubt;"
1611,CANTO XXXII,"And gladly will I loose the knot, wherein"
1612,CANTO XXXII,Thy subtle thoughts have bound thee.  From this realm
1613,CANTO XXXII,"Excluded, chalice no entrance here may find,"
1614,CANTO XXXII,"No more shall hunger, thirst, or sorrow can."
1615,CANTO XXXII,A law immutable hath establish'd all;
1616,CANTO XXXII,"Nor is there aught thou seest, that doth not fit,"
1617,CANTO XXXII,"Exactly, as the finger to the ring."
1618,CANTO XXXII,"It is not therefore without cause, that these,"
1619,CANTO XXXII,"O'erspeedy comers to immortal life,"
1620,CANTO XXXII,Are different in their shares of excellence.
1621,CANTO XXXII,Our Sovran Lord--that settleth this estate
1622,CANTO XXXII,"In love and in delight so absolute,"
1623,CANTO XXXII,"That wish can dare no further--every soul,"
1624,CANTO XXXII,"Created in his joyous sight to dwell,"
1625,CANTO XXXII,With grace at pleasure variously endows.
1626,CANTO XXXII,And for a proof th' effect may well suffice.
1627,CANTO XXXII,And 't is moreover most expressly mark'd
1628,CANTO XXXII,"In holy scripture, where the twins are said"
1629,CANTO XXXII,"To, have struggled in the womb.  Therefore, as grace"
1630,CANTO XXXII,"Inweaves the coronet, so every brow"
1631,CANTO XXXII,Weareth its proper hue of orient light.
1632,CANTO XXXII,"And merely in respect to his prime gift,"
1633,CANTO XXXII,"Not in reward of meritorious deed,"
1634,CANTO XXXII,Hath each his several degree assign'd.
1635,CANTO XXXII,In early times with their own innocence
1636,CANTO XXXII,"More was not wanting, than the parents' faith,"
1637,CANTO XXXII,"To save them: those first ages past, behoov'd"
1638,CANTO XXXII,That circumcision in the males should imp
1639,CANTO XXXII,The flight of innocent wings: but since the day
1640,CANTO XXXII,"Of grace hath come, without baptismal rites"
1641,CANTO XXXII,"In Christ accomplish'd, innocence herself"
1642,CANTO XXXII,Must linger yet below.  Now raise thy view
1643,CANTO XXXII,Unto the visage most resembling Christ:
1644,CANTO XXXII,"For, in her splendour only, shalt thou win"
1645,CANTO XXXII,"The pow'r to look on him.""  Forthwith I saw"
1646,CANTO XXXII,"Such floods of gladness on her visage shower'd,"
1647,CANTO XXXII,"From holy spirits, winging that profound;"
1648,CANTO XXXII,"That, whatsoever I had yet beheld,"
1649,CANTO XXXII,"Had not so much suspended me with wonder,"
1650,CANTO XXXII,Or shown me such similitude of God.
1651,CANTO XXXII,"And he, who had to her descended, once,"
1652,CANTO XXXII,"On earth, now hail'd in heav'n; and on pois'd wing."
1653,CANTO XXXII,"""Ave, Maria, Gratia Plena,"" sang:"
1654,CANTO XXXII,"To whose sweet anthem all the blissful court,"
1655,CANTO XXXII,"From all parts answ'ring, rang: that holier joy"
1656,CANTO XXXII,"Brooded the deep serene.  ""Father rever'd:"
1657,CANTO XXXII,"Who deign'st, for me, to quit the pleasant place,"
1658,CANTO XXXII,"Wherein thou sittest, by eternal lot!"
1659,CANTO XXXII,"Say, who that angel is, that with such glee"
1660,CANTO XXXII,"Beholds our queen, and so enamour'd glows"
1661,CANTO XXXII,"Of her high beauty, that all fire he seems."""
1662,CANTO XXXII,So I again resorted to the lore
1663,CANTO XXXII,"Of my wise teacher, he, whom Mary's charms"
1664,CANTO XXXII,"Embellish'd, as the sun the morning star;"
1665,CANTO XXXII,"Who thus in answer spake: ""In him are summ'd,"
1666,CANTO XXXII,Whatever of buxomness and free delight
1667,CANTO XXXII,"May be in Spirit, or in angel, met:"
1668,CANTO XXXII,And so beseems: for that he bare the palm
1669,CANTO XXXII,"Down unto Mary, when the Son of God"
1670,CANTO XXXII,Vouchsaf'd to clothe him in terrestrial weeds.
1671,CANTO XXXII,"Now let thine eyes wait heedful on my words,"
1672,CANTO XXXII,And note thou of this just and pious realm
1673,CANTO XXXII,"The chiefest nobles.  Those, highest in bliss,"
1674,CANTO XXXII,"The twain, on each hand next our empress thron'd,"
1675,CANTO XXXII,Are as it were two roots unto this rose.
1676,CANTO XXXII,"He to the left, the parent, whose rash taste"
1677,CANTO XXXII,"Proves bitter to his seed; and, on the right,"
1678,CANTO XXXII,"That ancient father of the holy church,"
1679,CANTO XXXII,Into whose keeping Christ did give the keys
1680,CANTO XXXII,"Of this sweet flow'r: near whom behold the seer,"
1681,CANTO XXXII,"That, ere he died, saw all the grievous times"
1682,CANTO XXXII,"Of the fair bride, who with the lance and nails"
1683,CANTO XXXII,"Was won.  And, near unto the other, rests"
1684,CANTO XXXII,"The leader, under whom on manna fed"
1685,CANTO XXXII,"Th' ungrateful nation, fickle and perverse."
1686,CANTO XXXII,"On th' other part, facing to Peter, lo!"
1687,CANTO XXXII,"Where Anna sits, so well content to look"
1688,CANTO XXXII,"On her lov'd daughter, that with moveless eye"
1689,CANTO XXXII,"She chants the loud hosanna: while, oppos'd"
1690,CANTO XXXII,"To the first father of your mortal kind,"
1691,CANTO XXXII,"Is Lucia, at whose hest thy lady sped,"
1692,CANTO XXXII,When on the edge of ruin clos'd thine eye.
1693,CANTO XXXII,
1694,CANTO XXXII,"""But (for the vision hasteneth so an end)"
1695,CANTO XXXII,"Here break we off, as the good workman doth,"
1696,CANTO XXXII,That shapes the cloak according to the cloth:
1697,CANTO XXXII,And to the primal love our ken shall rise;
1698,CANTO XXXII,"That thou mayst penetrate the brightness, far"
1699,CANTO XXXII,"As sight can bear thee.  Yet, alas! in sooth"
1700,CANTO XXXII,"Beating thy pennons, thinking to advance,"
1701,CANTO XXXII,Thou backward fall'st.  Grace then must first be gain'd;
1702,CANTO XXXII,"Her grace, whose might can help thee.  Thou in prayer"
1703,CANTO XXXII,"Seek her: and, with affection, whilst I sue,"
1704,CANTO XXXII,"Attend, and yield me all thy heart.""  He said,"
1705,CANTO XXXII,And thus the saintly orison began.
1706,CANTO XXXII,
1707,CANTO XXXII,
1708,CANTO XXXII,
1709,CANTO XXXII,
1710,CANTO XXXIII,CANTO XXXIII
1711,CANTO XXXIII,
1712,CANTO XXXIII,"""O virgin mother, daughter of thy Son,"
1713,CANTO XXXIII,Created beings all in lowliness
1714,CANTO XXXIII,"Surpassing, as in height, above them all,"
1715,CANTO XXXIII,"Term by th' eternal counsel pre-ordain'd,"
1716,CANTO XXXIII,"Ennobler of thy nature, so advanc'd"
1717,CANTO XXXIII,"In thee, that its great Maker did not scorn,"
1718,CANTO XXXIII,"Himself, in his own work enclos'd to dwell!"
1719,CANTO XXXIII,For in thy womb rekindling shone the love
1720,CANTO XXXIII,"Reveal'd, whose genial influence makes now"
1721,CANTO XXXIII,This flower to germin in eternal peace!
1722,CANTO XXXIII,"Here thou to us, of charity and love,"
1723,CANTO XXXIII,"Art, as the noon-day torch: and art, beneath,"
1724,CANTO XXXIII,"To mortal men, of hope a living spring."
1725,CANTO XXXIII,"So mighty art thou, lady! and so great,"
1726,CANTO XXXIII,"That he who grace desireth, and comes not"
1727,CANTO XXXIII,"To thee for aidance, fain would have desire"
1728,CANTO XXXIII,"Fly without wings.  Nor only him who asks,"
1729,CANTO XXXIII,"Thy bounty succours, but doth freely oft"
1730,CANTO XXXIII,Forerun the asking.  Whatsoe'er may be
1731,CANTO XXXIII,"Of excellence in creature, pity mild,"
1732,CANTO XXXIII,"Relenting mercy, large munificence,"
1733,CANTO XXXIII,"Are all combin'd in thee.  Here kneeleth one,"
1734,CANTO XXXIII,"Who of all spirits hath review'd the state,"
1735,CANTO XXXIII,From the world's lowest gap unto this height.
1736,CANTO XXXIII,"Suppliant to thee he kneels, imploring grace"
1737,CANTO XXXIII,"For virtue, yet more high to lift his ken"
1738,CANTO XXXIII,"Toward the bliss supreme.  And I, who ne'er"
1739,CANTO XXXIII,"Coveted sight, more fondly, for myself,"
1740,CANTO XXXIII,"Than now for him, my prayers to thee prefer,"
1741,CANTO XXXIII,(And pray they be not scant) that thou wouldst drive
1742,CANTO XXXIII,Each cloud of his mortality away;
1743,CANTO XXXIII,That on the sovran pleasure he may gaze.
1744,CANTO XXXIII,"This also I entreat of thee, O queen!"
1745,CANTO XXXIII,Who canst do what thou wilt! that in him thou
1746,CANTO XXXIII,"Wouldst after all he hath beheld, preserve"
1747,CANTO XXXIII,"Affection sound, and human passions quell."
1748,CANTO XXXIII,"Lo!  Where, with Beatrice, many a saint"
1749,CANTO XXXIII,"Stretch their clasp'd hands, in furtherance of my suit!"""
1750,CANTO XXXIII,
1751,CANTO XXXIII,"The eyes, that heav'n with love and awe regards,"
1752,CANTO XXXIII,"Fix'd on the suitor, witness'd, how benign"
1753,CANTO XXXIII,She looks on pious pray'rs: then fasten'd they
1754,CANTO XXXIII,"On th' everlasting light, wherein no eye"
1755,CANTO XXXIII,"Of creature, as may well be thought, so far"
1756,CANTO XXXIII,"Can travel inward.  I, meanwhile, who drew"
1757,CANTO XXXIII,"Near to the limit, where all wishes end,"
1758,CANTO XXXIII,"The ardour of my wish (for so behooved),"
1759,CANTO XXXIII,"Ended within me. Beck'ning smil'd the sage,"
1760,CANTO XXXIII,"That I should look aloft: but, ere he bade,"
1761,CANTO XXXIII,Already of myself aloft I look'd;
1762,CANTO XXXIII,"For visual strength, refining more and more,"
1763,CANTO XXXIII,Bare me into the ray authentical
1764,CANTO XXXIII,"Of sovran light.  Thenceforward, what I saw,"
1765,CANTO XXXIII,"Was not for words to speak, nor memory's self"
1766,CANTO XXXIII,To stand against such outrage on her skill.
1767,CANTO XXXIII,"As one, who from a dream awaken'd, straight,"
1768,CANTO XXXIII,All he hath seen forgets; yet still retains
1769,CANTO XXXIII,Impression of the feeling in his dream;
1770,CANTO XXXIII,"E'en such am I: for all the vision dies,"
1771,CANTO XXXIII,"As 't were, away; and yet the sense of sweet,"
1772,CANTO XXXIII,"That sprang from it, still trickles in my heart."
1773,CANTO XXXIII,Thus in the sun-thaw is the snow unseal'd;
1774,CANTO XXXIII,Thus in the winds on flitting leaves was lost
1775,CANTO XXXIII,The Sybil's sentence.  O eternal beam!
1776,CANTO XXXIII,(Whose height what reach of mortal thought may soar?)
1777,CANTO XXXIII,Yield me again some little particle
1778,CANTO XXXIII,"Of what thou then appearedst, give my tongue"
1779,CANTO XXXIII,"Power, but to leave one sparkle of thy glory,"
1780,CANTO XXXIII,"Unto the race to come, that shall not lose"
1781,CANTO XXXIII,"Thy triumph wholly, if thou waken aught"
1782,CANTO XXXIII,"Of memory in me, and endure to hear"
1783,CANTO XXXIII,The record sound in this unequal strain.
1784,CANTO XXXIII,
1785,CANTO XXXIII,"Such keenness from the living ray I met,"
1786,CANTO XXXIII,"That, if mine eyes had turn'd away, methinks,"
1787,CANTO XXXIII,"I had been lost; but, so embolden'd, on"
1788,CANTO XXXIII,"I pass'd, as I remember, till my view"
1789,CANTO XXXIII,Hover'd the brink of dread infinitude.
1790,CANTO XXXIII,
1791,CANTO XXXIII,O grace! unenvying of thy boon! that gav'st
1792,CANTO XXXIII,Boldness to fix so earnestly my ken
1793,CANTO XXXIII,"On th' everlasting splendour, that I look'd,"
1794,CANTO XXXIII,"While sight was unconsum'd, and, in that depth,"
1795,CANTO XXXIII,"Saw in one volume clasp'd of love, whatever"
1796,CANTO XXXIII,The universe unfolds; all properties
1797,CANTO XXXIII,"Of substance and of accident, beheld,"
1798,CANTO XXXIII,"Compounded, yet one individual light"
1799,CANTO XXXIII,The whole.  And of such bond methinks I saw
1800,CANTO XXXIII,The universal form: for that whenever
1801,CANTO XXXIII,"I do but speak of it, my soul dilates"
1802,CANTO XXXIII,"Beyond her proper self; and, till I speak,"
1803,CANTO XXXIII,"One moment seems a longer lethargy,"
1804,CANTO XXXIII,Than five-and-twenty ages had appear'd
1805,CANTO XXXIII,"To that emprize, that first made Neptune wonder"
1806,CANTO XXXIII,At Argo's shadow darkening on his flood.
1807,CANTO XXXIII,
1808,CANTO XXXIII,"With fixed heed, suspense and motionless,"
1809,CANTO XXXIII,Wond'ring I gaz'd; and admiration still
1810,CANTO XXXIII,"Was kindled, as I gaz'd.  It may not be,"
1811,CANTO XXXIII,"That one, who looks upon that light, can turn"
1812,CANTO XXXIII,"To other object, willingly, his view."
1813,CANTO XXXIII,"For all the good, that will may covet, there"
1814,CANTO XXXIII,"Is summ'd; and all, elsewhere defective found,"
1815,CANTO XXXIII,"Complete.  My tongue shall utter now, no more"
1816,CANTO XXXIII,"E'en what remembrance keeps, than could the babe's"
1817,CANTO XXXIII,That yet is moisten'd at his mother's breast.
1818,CANTO XXXIII,Not that the semblance of the living light
1819,CANTO XXXIII,Was chang'd (that ever as at first remain'd)
1820,CANTO XXXIII,"But that my vision quickening, in that sole"
1821,CANTO XXXIII,"Appearance, still new miracles descry'd,"
1822,CANTO XXXIII,And toil'd me with the change.  In that abyss
1823,CANTO XXXIII,"Of radiance, clear and lofty, seem'd methought,"
1824,CANTO XXXIII,Three orbs of triple hue clipt in one bound:
1825,CANTO XXXIII,"And, from another, one reflected seem'd,"
1826,CANTO XXXIII,As rainbow is from rainbow: and the third
1827,CANTO XXXIII,"Seem'd fire, breath'd equally from both.  Oh speech"
1828,CANTO XXXIII,"How feeble and how faint art thou, to give"
1829,CANTO XXXIII,Conception birth!  Yet this to what I saw
1830,CANTO XXXIII,Is less than little.  Oh eternal light!
1831,CANTO XXXIII,Sole in thyself that dwellst; and of thyself
1832,CANTO XXXIII,"Sole understood, past, present, or to come!"
1833,CANTO XXXIII,"Thou smiledst; on that circling, which in thee"
1834,CANTO XXXIII,"Seem'd as reflected splendour, while I mus'd;"
1835,CANTO XXXIII,"For I therein, methought, in its own hue"
1836,CANTO XXXIII,Beheld our image painted: steadfastly
1837,CANTO XXXIII,I therefore por'd upon the view.  As one
1838,CANTO XXXIII,"Who vers'd in geometric lore, would fain"
1839,CANTO XXXIII,"Measure the circle; and, though pondering long"
1840,CANTO XXXIII,"And deeply, that beginning, which he needs,"
1841,CANTO XXXIII,"Finds not; e'en such was I, intent to scan"
1842,CANTO XXXIII,"The novel wonder, and trace out the form,"
1843,CANTO XXXIII,"How to the circle fitted, and therein"
1844,CANTO XXXIII,How plac'd: but the flight was not for my wing;
1845,CANTO XXXIII,"Had not a flash darted athwart my mind,"
1846,CANTO XXXIII,And in the spleen unfolded what it sought.
1847,CANTO XXXIII,
1848,CANTO XXXIII,Here vigour fail'd the tow'ring fantasy:
1849,CANTO XXXIII,"But yet the will roll'd onward, like a wheel"
1850,CANTO XXXIII,"In even motion, by the Love impell'd,"
1851,CANTO XXXIII,That moves the sun in heav'n and all the stars.
