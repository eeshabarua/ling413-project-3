476,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],which the ears at least of the world are familiar. But it is not
477,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],unreasonable to demand of them some such reason for their boldness as
478,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],shall be at any rate presumably related to public utility. Complying
479,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"with this demand by anticipation, I will place in the foreground an"
480,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],explicit statement of the objects which I have in view.
481,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],
482,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"These objects are twofold: firstly, to promote and extend the fruitful"
483,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"study of the immortal poems of Homer; and secondly, to vindicate for"
484,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"them, in an age of discussion, their just degree both of absolute and,"
485,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"more especially, of relative critical value. My desire is to indicate"
486,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"at least, if I cannot hope to establish, their proper place, both"
487,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"in the discipline of classical education, and among the materials of"
488,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"historical inquiry. When the world has been hearing and reading Homer,"
489,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"and talking and writing about him, for nearly three thousand years,"
490,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],it may seem strange thus to imply that he is still an ‘inheritor of
491,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"unfulfilled renown,’[2] and not yet in full possession of his lawful"
492,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],throne. He who seems to impeach the knowledge and judgment of all
493,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"former ages, himself runs but an evil chance, and is likely to be found"
494,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"guilty of ignorance and folly. Such, however, is not my design. There"
495,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],is no reason to doubt that Greece
496,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],
497,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],Dum fortuna fuit
498,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],
499,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"knew right well her own noble child, and paid him all the homage that"
500,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"even he could justly claim. But in later times, and in most of the"
501,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"lands where he is a foreigner, I know not if he has ever yet enjoyed"
502,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"his full honour from the educated world. He is, I trust, coming to it;"
503,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"and my desire is to accelerate, if ever so little, the movement in that"
504,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],direction.
505,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],
506,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"As respects the first portion of the design which has been described,"
507,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],I would offer the following considerations. The controversy _de vitâ
508,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"et sanguine_, concerning the personality of the poet, and the unity"
509,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"and antiquity of the works, has been carried on with vigour for near a"
510,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"century. In default of extraneous testimony, the materials of warfare"
511,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],have been sedulously sought in the rich mine which was offered by the
512,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],poems themselves. There has resulted from this cause a closer study of
513,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"the text, and a fuller development of much that it contains, than could"
514,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],have been expected in times when the student of Homer had only to enjoy
515,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"his banquet, and not to fight for it before he could sit down. It is"
516,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"not merely, however, in warmth of feeling that he may have profited;"
517,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"the Iliad and the Odyssey have been, from the absolute necessity of the"
518,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"case, put into the witness-box themselves, examined and cross-examined"
519,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"in every variety of temper, and thus, in some degree at least, made"
520,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],to tell their own story. The result has been upon the whole greatly
521,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"in their favour. The more they are searched and tested, the more does"
522,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"it appear they have to say, and the better does their testimony hang"
523,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"together. The more plain does it become, that the arguments used on the"
524,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],side of scepticism and annihilation are generally of a technical and
525,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"external character, and the greater is the mass of moral and internal"
526,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"evidence continually accumulated against them. In consequence, there"
527,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"has set in a strong reaction among scholars, even in Germany (in"
528,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"England the destructive theories never greatly throve), on behalf of"
529,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"the affirmative side of all, or nearly all, the main questions which"
530,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"had been raised. Mure,[3] the last and perhaps most distinguished of"
531,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"British writers on this subject, has left the debate in such a state"
532,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"that those who follow him may be excused, and may excuse their readers,"
533,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],from systematic preliminary discussion; and may proceed upon the
534,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],assumption that the Iliad and Odyssey are in their substance the true
535,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"offspring of the heroic age itself, and are genuine gifts not only of a"
536,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"remote antiquity but of a designing mind; as well as that he, to whom"
537,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"that mind belonged, has been justly declared by the verdict of all ages"
538,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],to be the patriarch of poets. These controversies have been ‘bolted to
539,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"the bran;’ for us at least they are all but dead, and to me it seems"
540,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],little better than lost time to revive them.
541,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],
542,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],Having then at the present day the title to the estate in some degree
543,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"secured from litigation, we may enter upon the fruition of it, and with"
544,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"all the truer zest on account of the conflict, which has been long and"
545,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"keenly fought, and in the general opinion fairly won. It now becomes"
546,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"all those, who love Homer, to prosecute the sure method of inquiry"
547,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"and appreciation by close, continued, comprehensive study of the"
548,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"text; a study of which it would be easy to prove the need, by showing"
549,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"how inaccurately the poems are often cited in quarters, to which the"
550,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],general reader justifiably looks for trustworthy information. To this
551,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],we have been exhorted by the writer already named:[4] and we have
552,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],only to make his practice our model. That something has already been
553,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"attained, we may judge by comparison. Let us take a single instance."
554,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],In the year 1735 was published ‘Blackwell’s Inquiry into the Life and
555,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"Writings of Homer.’ Bentley, as it would appear from Bishop Monk’s"
556,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"Life[5] of that extraordinary scholar, was not to be taken in by a"
557,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],book of this kind: but such men as Bentley are not samples of their
558,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"time, they are living symbols and predictions of what it will require"
559,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],years or generations to accomplish. We may rather judge of the common
560,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"impression made by this book, from the Notes to Pope’s Preface to the"
561,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"Iliad, where Warton[6] extols it as ‘a work that abounds in curious"
562,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"researches and observations, and places Homer in a new light.’ But no"
563,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"reader of Homer, in our own time, would really, I apprehend, be the"
564,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"poorer, if every copy of it could be burned."
565,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],
566,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"Since the time of Blackwell’s work, important aids have been gained"
567,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"towards the study of Homer, by the researches of travellers, fruitful"
568,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"in circumstantial evidence, and by the discovery of the Venetian"
569,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"Scholia, as well as by the persevering labours of modern critics."
570,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],We have been gradually coming to understand that these precious
571,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"works, which may have formed the delight of our boyhood, have also"
572,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],been designed to instruct our maturer years. I do not here refer
573,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],to their poetic power and splendour only. It is now time that we
574,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"should recognise the truth, that they constitute a vast depository of"
575,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"knowledge upon subjects of deep interest, and of boundless variety;"
576,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"and that this is a knowledge, too, which can be had from them alone."
577,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"It was the Greek mind transferred, without doubt, in some part through"
578,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"Italy, but yet only transferred, and still Greek both in origin and"
579,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"in much of its essence, in which was shaped and tempered the original"
580,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],mould of the modern European civilization. I speak now of civilization
581,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"as a thing distinct from religion, but destined to combine and coalesce"
582,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],with it. The power derived from this source was to stand in subordinate
583,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"conjunction with the Gospel, and to contribute its own share towards"
584,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],the training of mankind. From hence were to be derived the forms and
585,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"materials of thought, of imaginative culture, of the whole education"
586,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"of the intellectual soul, which, when pervaded with an higher life from"
587,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"the Divine fountain, was thus to be secured from corruption, and both"
588,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],placed and kept in harmony with the world of spirits.
589,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],
590,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"This Greek mind, which thus became one of the main factors of the"
591,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"civilized life of Christendom, cannot be fully comprehended without the"
592,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"study of Homer, and is nowhere so vividly or so sincerely exhibited as"
593,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"in his works. He has a world of his own, into which, upon his strong"
594,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"wing, he carries us. There we find ourselves amidst a system of ideas,"
595,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"feelings, and actions, different from what are to be found anywhere"
596,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],else; and forming a new and distinct standard of humanity. Many among
597,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],them seem as if they were then shortly about to be buried under a mass
598,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"of ruins, in order that they might subsequently reappear, bright and"
599,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"fresh for application, among later generations of men. Others of them"
600,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"almost carry us back to the early morning of our race, the hours of its"
601,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"greater simplicity and purity, and more free intercourse with God. In"
602,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"much that this Homeric world exhibits, we see the taint of sin at work,"
603,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"but far, as yet, from its perfect work and its ripeness; it stands"
604,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"between Paradise and the vices of later heathenism, far from both,"
605,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],from the latter as well as from the former; and if among all earthly
606,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"knowledge, the knowledge of man be that which we should chiefly court,"
607,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"and if to be genuine it should be founded upon experience, how is it"
608,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],possible to over-value this primitive representation of the human race
609,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"in a form complete, distinct, and separate, with its own religion,"
610,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"ethics, policy, history, arts, manners, fresh and true to the standard"
611,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"of its nature, like the form of an infant from the hand of the Creator,"
612,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"yet mature, full, and finished, in its own sense, after its own laws,"
613,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],like some masterpiece of the sculptor’s art.
614,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],
615,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],The poems of Homer never can be put in competition with the Sacred
616,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"Writings of the Old Testament, as regards the one invaluable code"
617,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],of Truth and Hope that was contained in them. But while the Jewish
618,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],records exhibit to us the link between man and the other world in the
619,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"earliest times, the poems of Homer show us the being, of whom God was"
620,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"pleased to be thus mindful, in the free unsuspecting play of his actual"
621,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"nature. The patriarchal and Jewish dispensations created, and sustained"
622,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"through Divine interposition, a state of things essentially special"
623,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],and exceptional: but here first we see our kind set to work out for
624,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"itself, under the lights which common life and experience supplied, the"
625,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"deep problem of his destiny. Nor is there, perhaps, any more solemn and"
626,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"melancholy lesson, than that which is to be learned from its continual"
627,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"downward course. If these words amount to a begging of the question,"
628,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"at least, it is most important for us to know whether the course was"
629,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"continually downwards; whether, as man enlarged his powers and his"
630,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"resources, he came nearer to, or went farther from his happiness and"
631,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"his perfection. Now, this inquiry cannot, for Europe and Christendom at"
632,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"least, be satisfactorily conducted, except in commencing from the basis"
633,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"which the Homeric poems supply. As regards the great Roman people,"
634,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"we know nothing of them, which is at once archaic and veracious. As"
635,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"regards the Greeks, it is Homer that furnishes the point of origin"
636,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],from which all distances are to be measured. When the historic period
637,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"began, Greece was already near its intellectual middle-age. Little can"
638,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],be learned of the relative movements of our moral and our mental nature
639,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"severally, from matching one portion of that period with another, in"
640,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],comparison with what we may gather from bringing into neighbourhood and
641,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"contrast the pristine and youthful Greece of Homer on the one hand,"
642,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"and, on the other, the developed and finished Greece of the age of the"
643,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],tragedians or the orators.
644,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],
645,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"The Mosaic books, and the other historical books of the Old Testament,"
646,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"are not intended to present, and do not present, a picture of human"
647,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"society, or of our nature drawn at large. Their aim is to exhibit it"
648,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"in one master-relation, and to do this with effect, they do it, to a"
649,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"great extent, exclusively. The Homeric materials for exhibiting that"
650,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"relation are different in kind as well as in degree: but as they paint,"
651,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"and paint to the very life, the whole range of our nature, and the"
652,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"entire circle of human action and experience, at an epoch much more"
653,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"nearly analogous to the patriarchal time than to any later age, the"
654,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"poems of Homer may be viewed, in the philosophy of human nature, as the"
655,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],complement of the earliest portion of the Sacred Records.
656,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],
657,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],Although the close and systematic study of the Homeric text has begun
658,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"at a date comparatively recent, yet the marked development of riches"
659,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"from within which it has produced, has already been a real, permanent,"
660,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],and vast addition to the mental wealth of mankind. We can now better
661,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],understand than formerly much that relates to the fame and authority
662,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"of this great poet in early times, and that we may formerly have"
663,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"contemplated as fanciful, exaggerated, or unreal. It was, we can now"
664,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"see, with no idle wonder that, while Greek philosophers took texts"
665,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"from him so largely in their schools, the Greek public listened to his"
666,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"strains in places of thronged resort, and in their solemn assemblages,"
667,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],and Greek warriors and statesmen kept him in their cabinets and under
668,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"their pillows; and, for the first and last time in the history of the"
669,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],"world, made the preservation of a poet’s compositions an object of"
670,I. PROLEGOMENA.[1],permanent public policy.

708,FOOTNOTES:,"Now, from these considerations may arise the important question, Does"
709,FOOTNOTES:,"Homer hold in our English education the place which is his due, and"
710,FOOTNOTES:,which it would be for our advantage to give him? An immense price is
711,FOOTNOTES:,paid by the youth of this country for classical acquirement. It is the

713,FOOTNOTES:,"to be hoped that this price will continue to be paid by all those, who"

716,FOOTNOTES:,"this there shall on no account be less. Still, viewing the greatness"

719,FOOTNOTES:,"both in measure and in quality. What, then, are the facts with respect"
720,FOOTNOTES:,to the study of Homer in England at the present day?
721,FOOTNOTES:,
722,FOOTNOTES:,I must here begin with the apology due from one who feels himself to
723,FOOTNOTES:,be far from perfectly informed on the case of which it is necessary to
724,FOOTNOTES:,give an outline. But even if I understate both the amount of Homeric
725,FOOTNOTES:,"study, and its efficiency, there will, I am confident, remain, after"
726,FOOTNOTES:,"every due allowance shall have been made for error, ample room for"
727,FOOTNOTES:,the application of the general propositions that I seek to enforce.
728,FOOTNOTES:,They are these: that the study of Homer in our Universities is as yet
729,FOOTNOTES:,"below the point to which it is desirable that it should be carried, and"
730,FOOTNOTES:,"that the same study, carried on at our public Schools, neither is,"
731,FOOTNOTES:,"nor can be made, a fitting substitute for what is thus wanting at the"
732,FOOTNOTES:,Universities.
733,FOOTNOTES:,
734,FOOTNOTES:,"In my own day, at Oxford, now a full quarter of a century ago, the"
735,FOOTNOTES:,"poems of Homer were read chiefly by way of exception, and in obedience"
736,FOOTNOTES:,to the impulse of individual tastes. They entered rather materially
737,FOOTNOTES:,into those examinations by which scholarship was principally to be
738,FOOTNOTES:,"tested, but they scarcely formed a substantive or recognised part"
739,FOOTNOTES:,"of the main studies of the place, which were directed to the final"
740,FOOTNOTES:,examination in the Schools for the Bachelor’s degree. I do not
741,FOOTNOTES:,recollect to have ever heard at that time of their being used as the
742,FOOTNOTES:,"subject matter of the ordinary tutorial lectures; and if they were so,"
743,FOOTNOTES:,"the case was certainly a rare one. Although the late Dr. Gaisford, in"
744,FOOTNOTES:,"the estimation of many the first scholar of his age, during his long"
745,FOOTNOTES:,"tenure of the Deanery of Christ Church, gave the whole weight of his"
746,FOOTNOTES:,"authority to the recommendation of Homeric study, it did not avail"
747,FOOTNOTES:,to bring about any material change. The basis of the Greek classical
748,FOOTNOTES:,"instruction lay chiefly in the philosophers, historians, and later"
749,FOOTNOTES:,"poets; and when Homer was, in the academical phrase, ‘taken up,’ he was"
750,FOOTNOTES:,"employed ornamentally, and therefore superficially, and was subjected"
751,FOOTNOTES:,"to no such searching and laborious methods of study as, to the great"
752,FOOTNOTES:,"honour and advantage of Oxford, were certainly applied to the authors"
753,FOOTNOTES:,who held the first rank in her practical system. I am led to believe
754,FOOTNOTES:,"that the case at Cambridge was not essentially different, although,"
755,FOOTNOTES:,from the greater relative space occupied there by examinations in pure
756,FOOTNOTES:,"scholarship, it is probable that Homer may, under that aspect at least,"
757,FOOTNOTES:,have attracted a greater share of attention.
758,FOOTNOTES:,
759,FOOTNOTES:,"When, however, the University of Oxford brought to maturity, in the"
760,FOOTNOTES:,"year 1850, a new Statute of examinations, efforts were made to promote"
761,FOOTNOTES:,"an extended study of Homer. Those efforts, it happily appears, have"
762,FOOTNOTES:,produced a considerable effect. Provision was made by that statute for
763,FOOTNOTES:,dividing the study of the poets from the philosophical and historical
764,FOOTNOTES:,"studies, and for including the former in the intermediate, or, as it is"
765,FOOTNOTES:,"termed, ‘first public’ examination, while both the latter were reserved"
766,FOOTNOTES:,"for the final trial, with which the period of undergraduateship is"
767,FOOTNOTES:,usually wound up. All candidates for honours in this intermediate
768,FOOTNOTES:,examination are now required to present not less than twelve Books
769,FOOTNOTES:,of Homer on the list of works in which they are to be examined. And
770,FOOTNOTES:,I understand that he has also taken his place among the regular
771,FOOTNOTES:,subjects of the tutorial lectures. This is a great sign of progress;
772,FOOTNOTES:,"and it may confidently be hoped that, under these circumstances, Homer"
773,FOOTNOTES:,will henceforward hold a much more forward position in the studies
774,FOOTNOTES:,"of Oxford. There remains something to desire, and that something, I"

778,FOOTNOTES:,"It is clear, that the study of this great master should not be confined"
779,FOOTNOTES:,"to preparation for examinations which deal principally with language,"
780,FOOTNOTES:,"or which cannot enter upon either primitive history, or philosophy, or"
781,FOOTNOTES:,"policy, or religion, except by way of secondary illustration. Better"
782,FOOTNOTES:,"far that he should be studied simply among the poets, than that he"
783,FOOTNOTES:,should not be studied at all. But as long as he is read only among the
784,FOOTNOTES:,"poets, he cannot, I believe, be read effectively for the higher and"
785,FOOTNOTES:,more varied purposes of which Homeric study is so largely susceptible.
786,FOOTNOTES:,
787,FOOTNOTES:,"The grammar, metre, and diction, the tastes, the whole poetic handling"
788,FOOTNOTES:,"and qualities of Homer, do, indeed, offer an assemblage of objects for"
789,FOOTNOTES:,"our consideration at once and alike singular, attractive, extended,"
790,FOOTNOTES:,and profitable. The extraneous controversies with which his name has
791,FOOTNOTES:,"so long been associated as to his personality and date, and as to the"
792,FOOTNOTES:,"unity and transmission of his works, although they are for us, I trust,"
793,FOOTNOTES:,"in substance nearly decided, yet are not likely to lose their literary"
794,FOOTNOTES:,"interest, were it only on account of the peculiarly convenient and"
795,FOOTNOTES:,seductive manner in which they open up many questions of primitive
796,FOOTNOTES:,"research; presenting these questions to us, as they do, not in the"
797,FOOTNOTES:,"dull garb pieced out of antiquarian scraps, but alive, and in the full"
798,FOOTNOTES:,movement of vigorous debate. All this is fit for delightful exercise;
799,FOOTNOTES:,but much more lies behind.
800,FOOTNOTES:,
801,FOOTNOTES:,"There is an inner Homeric world, of which his verse is the tabernacle"
802,FOOTNOTES:,"and his poetic genius the exponent, but which offers in itself a"
803,FOOTNOTES:,"spectacle of the most profound interest, quite apart from him who"
804,FOOTNOTES:,"introduces us to it, and from the means by which we are so introduced."
805,FOOTNOTES:,"This world of religion and ethics, of civil policy, of history and"
806,FOOTNOTES:,"ethnology, of manners and arts, so widely severed from all following"
807,FOOTNOTES:,"experience, that we may properly call them palæozoic, can hardly be"
808,FOOTNOTES:,"examined and understood by those, who are taught to approach Homer as a"
809,FOOTNOTES:,poet only.
810,FOOTNOTES:,
811,FOOTNOTES:,"Indeed, the transcendency of his poetical distinctions has tended to"
812,FOOTNOTES:,overshadow his other claims and uses. As settlers in the very richest
813,FOOTNOTES:,"soils, saturated with the fruits which they almost spontaneously yield,"
814,FOOTNOTES:,"rarely turn their whole powers to account, so they, that are taught"
815,FOOTNOTES:,"simply to repair to Homer for his poetry, find in him, so considered,"
816,FOOTNOTES:,"such ample resources for enjoyment, that, unless summoned onwards by a"
817,FOOTNOTES:,"distinct and separate call, they are little likely to travel further."
818,FOOTNOTES:,It was thus that Lord Bacon’s brilliant fame as a philosopher diverted
819,FOOTNOTES:,public attention from his merits as a political historian.[7] It was
820,FOOTNOTES:,"thus, to take a nearer instance, that most readers of Dante, while"
821,FOOTNOTES:,"submitting their imaginations to his powerful sway, have been almost"
822,FOOTNOTES:,wholly unconscious that they were in the hands of one of the most
823,FOOTNOTES:,"acute and exact of metaphysicians, one of the most tender, earnest,"
824,FOOTNOTES:,"and profound among spiritual writers. Here, indeed, the process has"
825,FOOTNOTES:,"been simpler in form; for the majority, at least, of readers, have"
826,FOOTNOTES:,"stopped with the striking, and, so to speak, incorporated imagery of"
827,FOOTNOTES:,"the ‘Inferno,’ and have not so much as read the following, which are"
828,FOOTNOTES:,"also the loftier and more ethereal, portions of the ‘Divina Commedia.’"
829,FOOTNOTES:,"It may be enough for Homer’s fame, that the consent of mankind has"
830,FOOTNOTES:,"irrevocably assigned to him a supremacy among poets, without real"
831,FOOTNOTES:,"competitors or partners, except Dante and Shakspeare; and that,"
832,FOOTNOTES:,"perhaps, if we take into view his date, the unpreparedness of the"
833,FOOTNOTES:,"world for works so extraordinary as his, the comparative paucity of"
834,FOOTNOTES:,"the traditional resources and training he could have inherited, he"
835,FOOTNOTES:,"then becomes the most extraordinary, as he is also the most ancient,"
836,FOOTNOTES:,phenomenon in the whole history of purely human culture. In particular
837,FOOTNOTES:,"points he appears to me, if it be not presumptuous to say so much, to"
838,FOOTNOTES:,remain to this day unquestionably without an equal in the management of
839,FOOTNOTES:,the poetic art. If Shakspeare be supreme in the intuitive knowledge of
840,FOOTNOTES:,"human nature and in the rapid and fertile vigour of his imagination, if"
841,FOOTNOTES:,Dante have the largest grasp of the ‘height and depth’ of all things
842,FOOTNOTES:,"created, if he stand first in the power of exhibiting and producing"
843,FOOTNOTES:,"ecstasy, and in the compressed and concentrated energy[8] of thought"
844,FOOTNOTES:,"and feeling, Homer, too, has his own peculiar prerogatives. Among them"
845,FOOTNOTES:,might perhaps be placed the faculty of high oratory; the art of turning
846,FOOTNOTES:,to account epithets and distinctive phrases; the production of indirect
847,FOOTNOTES:,or negative effects; and the power of creating and sustaining dramatic
848,FOOTNOTES:,"interest without the large use of wicked agents, in whom later poets"
849,FOOTNOTES:,have found their most indispensable auxiliaries. But all this is not
850,FOOTNOTES:,"enough for us who read him. If the works of Homer are, to letters and"
851,FOOTNOTES:,"to human learning, what the early books of Scripture are to the entire"
852,FOOTNOTES:,Bible and to the spiritual life of man; if in them lie the beginnings
853,FOOTNOTES:,"of the intellectual life of the world, then we must still recollect"
854,FOOTNOTES:,"that that life, to be rightly understood, should be studied in its"
855,FOOTNOTES:,beginnings. There we may see in simple forms what afterwards grew
856,FOOTNOTES:,"complex, and in clear light what afterwards became obscure; and there"
857,FOOTNOTES:,"we obtain starting-points, from which to measure progress and decay"
858,FOOTNOTES:,along all the lines upon which our nature moves.
859,FOOTNOTES:,
860,FOOTNOTES:,Over and above the general plea here offered for the study of Homer
861,FOOTNOTES:,"under other aspects than such as are merely poetical, there is"
862,FOOTNOTES:,"something to be said upon his claims in competition with other, and"
863,FOOTNOTES:,"especially with other Greek poets. The case of the Latin poets, nearer"
864,FOOTNOTES:,"to us historically, more accessible in tongue, more easily retained in"
865,FOOTNOTES:,"the mind under the pressure of after-life, more readily available for"
866,FOOTNOTES:,"literary and social purposes, must stand upon its own grounds."
867,FOOTNOTES:,
868,FOOTNOTES:,"In considering what is the place due to Homer in education, we cannot"
869,FOOTNOTES:,"altogether exclude from view the question of comparative value, as"
870,FOOTNOTES:,"between him and his now successful and overbearing rivals, the Greek"
871,FOOTNOTES:,"tragedians. For we are not to expect that of the total studies, at"
872,FOOTNOTES:,"least of Oxford and Cambridge, any larger share, speaking generally,"
873,FOOTNOTES:,"can hereafter be given to Greek poetry, as a whole, than has heretofore"
874,FOOTNOTES:,been so bestowed. It is rather a question whether there should be some
875,FOOTNOTES:,"shifting, or less uniformity, in the present distribution of time and"
876,FOOTNOTES:,"labour, as among the different claimants within that attractive field."
877,FOOTNOTES:,
878,FOOTNOTES:,I do not dispute the merits of the tragedians as masters in their noble
879,FOOTNOTES:,"art. As long as letters are cultivated among mankind, for so long"
880,FOOTNOTES:,their honours are secure. I do not question the advantage of studying
881,FOOTNOTES:,"the Greek language in its most fixed and most exact forms, which they"
882,FOOTNOTES:,"present in perfection; nor their equal, at least, if not greater value"
883,FOOTNOTES:,"than Homer, as practical helps and models in Greek composition. But,"
884,FOOTNOTES:,"after all allowances on these, or on any other score, they cannot,"
885,FOOTNOTES:,"even in respect of purely poetic titles, make good a claim to that"
886,FOOTNOTES:,"preference over Homer, which they have, nevertheless, extensively"
887,FOOTNOTES:,"enjoyed. I refer far less to Æschylus than to the others, because"
888,FOOTNOTES:,"he seems more to resemble Homer not only in majesty, but in nature,"
889,FOOTNOTES:,"reality, and historical veracity: and far less again to Sophocles, than"
890,FOOTNOTES:,"to Euripides. But it may be said of them, generally, though in greatly"
891,FOOTNOTES:,"differing degrees, that while with Homer everything is pre-eminently"
892,FOOTNOTES:,"fresh and genuine, with them, on the contrary, this freshness and"
893,FOOTNOTES:,"genuineness, this life-likeness, are for the most part wanting. We"
894,FOOTNOTES:,"are reminded, by the matter itself, of the masks in which the actors"
895,FOOTNOTES:,"appeared, of the mechanical appliances with the aid of which they"
896,FOOTNOTES:,"spoke. The very existence of the word, ἐκτραγῳδεῖν,[9] and other[10]"
897,FOOTNOTES:,"like compounds, shows us that, in the Greek tragedy, human nature and"
898,FOOTNOTES:,human life were not represented at large; they were got up; they were
899,FOOTNOTES:,"placed in the light of certain peculiar ideas, with a view to peculiar"
900,FOOTNOTES:,"effects. The dramas were magnificent and also instructive pictures, but"
901,FOOTNOTES:,"they taught, as it were, certain set lessons only: they were pictures"
902,FOOTNOTES:,"_sui generis_, pictures marked with a certain mannerism, pictures"
903,FOOTNOTES:,"in which the artist follows a standard which is neither original,"
904,FOOTNOTES:,"nor general, nor truly normal. Let us try the test of an expression"
905,FOOTNOTES:,somewhat kindred in etymology: such a word as ἐξομηροῦν would carry
906,FOOTNOTES:,"upon its face a damning solecism. Again, let us mark the difference"
907,FOOTNOTES:,which was observed by the sagacity of Aristotle.[11] With the speeches
908,FOOTNOTES:,"in the Iliad, he compares the speeches in the tragedians; those most"
909,FOOTNOTES:,"remarkable and telling compositions, which we have occasion so often to"
910,FOOTNOTES:,"admire in Euripides. But, as he says, the Characters of the ancients,"
911,FOOTNOTES:,"doubtless meaning Homer, speak πολιτικῶς, those of the moderns,"
912,FOOTNOTES:,ῥητορικῶς. I know no reason why the speeches of Achilles should not be
913,FOOTNOTES:,compared with the finest passages of Demosthenes: but no one could make
914,FOOTNOTES:,"such a comparison between Demosthenes and the speeches, though they are"
915,FOOTNOTES:,"most powerful and effective harangues, which we find in the Troades,"
916,FOOTNOTES:,or the Iphigenia in Aulide. This contrast of the earnest and practical
917,FOOTNOTES:,"with the artificial, runs, more or less, along the whole line which"
918,FOOTNOTES:,"divides Homer from the tragedians, particularly from Euripides."
919,FOOTNOTES:,
920,FOOTNOTES:,"When we consider the case in another point of view, and estimate these"
921,FOOTNOTES:,"poets with reference to what they tell, and not to the mere manner of"
922,FOOTNOTES:,"their telling it, the argument for assigning to Homer a greater share"
923,FOOTNOTES:,"of the attention of our youth, becomes yet stronger. For it must be"
924,FOOTNOTES:,"admitted that the tragedians, especially the two later of the three,"
925,FOOTNOTES:,"teach us but very little of the Greek religion, history, manners,"
926,FOOTNOTES:,"arts, or institutions. At the period when they wrote, the religion of"
927,FOOTNOTES:,"the country had become political or else histrionic in its spirit,"
928,FOOTNOTES:,"and the figures it presented were not only multiplied, but were also"
929,FOOTNOTES:,"hopelessly confused: while morals had sunk into very gross corruption,"
930,FOOTNOTES:,"of which, as we have it upon explicit evidence, two at least of them"
931,FOOTNOTES:,"largely partook. The characters and incidents of their own time, and"
932,FOOTNOTES:,"of the generations which immediately preceded it, were found to be"
933,FOOTNOTES:,"growing less suitable for the stage. They were led, from this and other"
934,FOOTNOTES:,"causes, to fetch their themes, in general, from the remote period of"
935,FOOTNOTES:,the heroic or pre-historic ages. But of the traditions of those ages
936,FOOTNOTES:,they were no adequate expositors; hence the representations of them
937,FOOTNOTES:,"are, for the most part, couched in altered and degenerate forms. This"
938,FOOTNOTES:,"will be most clearly seen upon examining the Homeric personages, as"
939,FOOTNOTES:,they appear in the plays of Euripides. Here they seem often to retain
940,FOOTNOTES:,"no sign of identity except the name. The ‘form and pressure,’ and also"
941,FOOTNOTES:,"the machinery or physical circumstances of the Greek drama, were such"
942,FOOTNOTES:,"as to keep the tragedians, so to speak, upon stilts, while its limited"
943,FOOTNOTES:,scope of necessity excluded much that was comprised in the wide circle
944,FOOTNOTES:,"of the epic action; so that they open to us little, in comparison with"
945,FOOTNOTES:,"Homer, of the Greek mind and life: of that cradle wherein lie, we are"
946,FOOTNOTES:,"to remember, the original form and elements, in so far as they are"
947,FOOTNOTES:,"secular, of European civilization."
948,FOOTNOTES:,
949,FOOTNOTES:,If I may judge in any degree of the minds of others by my own
950,FOOTNOTES:,"experience, nothing is more astonishing in Homer, than the mass of"
951,FOOTNOTES:,"his matter. Especially is this true of the Iliad, which most men"
952,FOOTNOTES:,"suppose to be little more than a gigantic battle-piece. But that poem,"
953,FOOTNOTES:,"battle-piece as it is, where we might expect to find only the glitter"
954,FOOTNOTES:,"and the clash of arms, is rich in every kind of knowledge, perhaps"
955,FOOTNOTES:,richest of all in the political and historical departments. It is
956,FOOTNOTES:,"hardly too much to say, in general, that besides his claims as a poet,"
957,FOOTNOTES:,"Homer has, for himself, all the claims that all the other classes"
958,FOOTNOTES:,"of ancient writers can advance for themselves, each in his separate"
959,FOOTNOTES:,"department. And, excepting the works of Aristotle and Plato, on either"
960,FOOTNOTES:,of which may be grafted the investigation of the whole philosophy of
961,FOOTNOTES:,"the world, I know of no author, among those who are commonly studied"
962,FOOTNOTES:,"at Oxford, offering a field of labour and inquiry either so wide or so"
963,FOOTNOTES:,"diversified, as that which Homer offers."
964,FOOTNOTES:,
965,FOOTNOTES:,"But, if Homer is not fully studied in our universities, there is no"
966,FOOTNOTES:,"adequate consolation to be found in the fact, that he is so much read"
967,FOOTNOTES:,in our public schools.
968,FOOTNOTES:,
969,FOOTNOTES:,I am very far indeed from lamenting that he is thus read. His free and
970,FOOTNOTES:,genial temperament gives him a hold on the sympathies of the young.
971,FOOTNOTES:,The simple and direct construction of almost all his sentences allows
972,FOOTNOTES:,them easy access to his meaning; the examination of the sense of single
973,FOOTNOTES:,"words, so often requisite, is within their reach; while it may readily"
974,FOOTNOTES:,"be believed that the large and varied inflexions of the Greek tongue,"
975,FOOTNOTES:,"in his hands at once so accurate and so elastic, make him peculiarly"
976,FOOTNOTES:,"fit for the indispensable and invaluable work of parsing. It may be,"
977,FOOTNOTES:,that for boyhood Homer finds ample employment in his exterior and
978,FOOTNOTES:,more obvious aspects. But neither boyhood nor manhood can read Homer
979,FOOTNOTES:,"effectively for all purposes at once, if my estimate of those purposes"
980,FOOTNOTES:,"be correct. The question therefore is, how best to divide the work"
981,FOOTNOTES:,between the periods of life severally best suited to the different
982,FOOTNOTES:,parts of it.
983,FOOTNOTES:,
984,FOOTNOTES:,"It is, indeed, somewhat difficult, as a general rule, beneficially and"
985,FOOTNOTES:,effectively to use the same book at the same time as an instrument for
986,FOOTNOTES:,"teaching both the language in which it is written, and the subject"
987,FOOTNOTES:,"of which it treats. What is given honestly to the one purpose, will"
988,FOOTNOTES:,ordinarily be so much taken or withheld from the other. For the one
989,FOOTNOTES:,"object, the mind must be directed upon the thought of the author; for"
990,FOOTNOTES:,"the other, upon the material organ through which it is conveyed; or,"
991,FOOTNOTES:,"in other words, for the former of these two aims his language must be"
992,FOOTNOTES:,"regarded on its material, for the latter on its intellectual, side."
993,FOOTNOTES:,"The difficulty of combining these views, taken of necessity from"
994,FOOTNOTES:,"opposite quarters, increases in proportion as the student is young,"
995,FOOTNOTES:,"the language subtle, copious, and elaborate, the subject diversified"
996,FOOTNOTES:,"and extended. In some cases it may be slight, or, at least, easily"
997,FOOTNOTES:,surmountable; but it is raised nearly to its maximum in the instance
998,FOOTNOTES:,of Homer. There are few among us who can say that we learned much of
999,FOOTNOTES:,the inward parts of Homer in our boyhood; while perhaps we do not
1000,FOOTNOTES:,"feel that our labours upon him were below the average, such as it may"
1001,FOOTNOTES:,"have been, of our general exertions; and though other generations"
1002,FOOTNOTES:,"may greatly improve upon us, they cannot, I fear, master the higher"
1003,FOOTNOTES:,"properties of their author at that early period of life. Homer, if"
1004,FOOTNOTES:,"read at our public schools, is, and probably must be, read only, or in"
1005,FOOTNOTES:,"the main, for his diction and poetry (as commonly understood), even"
1006,FOOTNOTES:,by the most advanced; while to those less forward he is little more
1007,FOOTNOTES:,than a mechanical instrument for acquiring the beginnings of real
1008,FOOTNOTES:,"familiarity with the Greek tongue and its inflexions. If, therefore,"
1009,FOOTNOTES:,"he is to be read for his theology, history, ethics, politics, for his"
1010,FOOTNOTES:,"skill in the higher and more delicate parts of the poetic calling, for"
1011,FOOTNOTES:,"his never-ending lessons upon manners, arts, and society, if we are to"
1012,FOOTNOTES:,study in him the great map of that humanity which he so wonderfully
1013,FOOTNOTES:,"unfolds to our gaze,--he must be read at the universities, and read"
1014,FOOTNOTES:,with reference to his deeper treasures. He is second to none of the
1015,FOOTNOTES:,poets of Greece as the poet of boys; but he is far advanced before them
1016,FOOTNOTES:,"all, even before Æschylus and Aristophanes, as the poet of men."
1017,FOOTNOTES:,
1018,FOOTNOTES:,But no discussion upon the general as well as poetical elevation
1019,FOOTNOTES:,"of Homer, can be complete or satisfactory without a more definite"
1020,FOOTNOTES:,consideration of the question--What is the historical value of his
1021,FOOTNOTES:,"testimony? This is not settled by our showing either his existence, or"
1022,FOOTNOTES:,"his excellence in his art. No man doubts Ariosto’s, or Boiardo’s, or"
1023,FOOTNOTES:,"Virgil’s personality, or their high rank as poets; but neither would"
1024,FOOTNOTES:,any man quote them as authorities on a point of history. To arrive at
1025,FOOTNOTES:,"a right view of this further question, we must be reasonably assured"
1026,FOOTNOTES:,"alike of the nature of Homer’s original intention, of his opportunities"
1027,FOOTNOTES:,"of information, and of the soundness of his text. To these subjects"
1028,FOOTNOTES:,"I shall now proceed; in the meantime, enough may have been said to"
1029,FOOTNOTES:,explain the aim of these pages so far as regards the more fruitful
1030,FOOTNOTES:,"study of the works of Homer, the contemplation of them on the positive"

1054,FOOTNOTES:,sufficiently tell the tale of the race to which it belongs. But when
1055,FOOTNOTES:,"we come to seek for high beauty and for approaches to perfection, of"
1056,FOOTNOTES:,"how infinite a diversity, of what countless degrees, does form appear"
1057,FOOTNOTES:,"to be susceptible! How difficult it is to find these, except in mere"

1059,FOOTNOTES:,"treat the whole as a normal specimen, simply because parts are fine,"
1060,FOOTNOTES:,"or even superlative. When, again, we pass onward, and with the body"
1061,FOOTNOTES:,"regard also the mind of man, still greater is the range of differences,"
1062,FOOTNOTES:,and still more rare is either the development of parts in a degree
1063,FOOTNOTES:,"so high as to bring their single excellence near the ideal standard,"
1064,FOOTNOTES:,"or the accurate adjustment of their relations to one another, or the"
1065,FOOTNOTES:,completeness of the aggregate which they form.
1066,FOOTNOTES:,
1067,FOOTNOTES:,"Now, it appears to me, that in the case of Homer, together with the"
1068,FOOTNOTES:,"breadth and elevation of the highest genius, we have before us,"
1069,FOOTNOTES:,"and in a yet more remarkable degree, an even more rare fulness and"
1070,FOOTNOTES:,consistency of the various instruments and organs which make up the
1071,FOOTNOTES:,"apparatus of the human being--constituted as he is, in mind and body,"
1072,FOOTNOTES:,"and holding, as he does, on the one side of the Deity, and on the"
1073,FOOTNOTES:,"other, of the dust. Among all the qualities of the poems, there is"
1074,FOOTNOTES:,none more extraordinary than the general accuracy and perfection of
1075,FOOTNOTES:,"their minute detail, when considered with reference to the standards"
1076,FOOTNOTES:,"at which from time to time they aim. Where other poets sketch, Homer"
1077,FOOTNOTES:,"draws; and where they draw, he carves. He alone, of all the now famous"
1078,FOOTNOTES:,"epic writers, moves (in the Iliad especially) subject to the stricter"
1079,FOOTNOTES:,"laws of time and place; he alone, while producing an unsurpassed work"
1080,FOOTNOTES:,"of the imagination, is also the greatest chronicler that ever lived,"
1081,FOOTNOTES:,"and presents to us, from his own single hand, a representation of"
1082,FOOTNOTES:,"life, manners, history, of morals, theology, and politics, so vivid"
1083,FOOTNOTES:,"and comprehensive, that it may be hard to say whether any of the more"
1084,FOOTNOTES:,"refined ages of Greece or Rome, with their clouds of authors and their"
1085,FOOTNOTES:,"multiplied forms of historical record, are either more faithfully or"
1086,FOOTNOTES:,more completely conveyed to us. He alone presents to us a mind and an
1087,FOOTNOTES:,"organization working with such precision that, setting aside for the"
1088,FOOTNOTES:,"moment any question as to the genuineness of his text, we may reason"
1089,FOOTNOTES:,in general from his minutest indications with the confidence that they
1090,FOOTNOTES:,belong to some consistent and intelligible whole.
1091,FOOTNOTES:,
1092,FOOTNOTES:,"It may be right, however, to consider more circumstantially the"
1093,FOOTNOTES:,question of the historical authority of Homer. It has been justly
1094,FOOTNOTES:,"observed by Wachsmuth[12], that even the dissolution of his"
1095,FOOTNOTES:,individuality does not get rid of his authority. For if the works
1096,FOOTNOTES:,"reputed to be his had proceeded from many minds, yet still, according"
1097,FOOTNOTES:,"to their unity of colour, and their correspondence in ethical and"
1098,FOOTNOTES:,"intellectual tone with the events of the age they purport to describe,"
1099,FOOTNOTES:,"there would arise an argument, founded on internal evidence, for"
1100,FOOTNOTES:,the admissibility of the whole band into the class of trustworthy
1101,FOOTNOTES:,historical witnesses.
1102,FOOTNOTES:,
1103,FOOTNOTES:,"But, first of all, may we not ask, from whence comes the presumption"
1104,FOOTNOTES:,against Homer as an historical authority? Not from the fact that
1105,FOOTNOTES:,"he mixes marvels with common events; for this, to quote no other"
1106,FOOTNOTES:,"instance, would destroy along with him Herodotus. Does it not arise"
1107,FOOTNOTES:,from this--that his compositions are poetical--that history has long
1108,FOOTNOTES:,ceased to adopt the poetical form--that an old association has thus
1109,FOOTNOTES:,"been dissolved--that a new and adverse association has taken its place,"
1110,FOOTNOTES:,which connects poetry with fiction--and that we illogically reflect
1111,FOOTNOTES:,"this modern association upon early times, to which it is utterly"
1112,FOOTNOTES:,inapplicable?
1113,FOOTNOTES:,
1114,FOOTNOTES:,"If so, there is no burden of proof incumbent upon those, who regard"
1115,FOOTNOTES:,Homer as an historical authority. The presumptions are all in favour of
1116,FOOTNOTES:,"their so regarding him. The question will, of course, remain--In what"
1117,FOOTNOTES:,proportions has he mixed history with imaginative embellishment? And
1118,FOOTNOTES:,he has furnished us with some aids towards the consideration of this
1119,FOOTNOTES:,question.
1120,FOOTNOTES:,
1121,FOOTNOTES:,"The immense mass of matter contained in the Iliad, which is beyond what"
1122,FOOTNOTES:,"the action of the poem requires, and yet is in its nature properly"
1123,FOOTNOTES:,"historical, of itself supplies the strongest proof of the historic"
1124,FOOTNOTES:,"aims of the poet. Whether, in the introduction of all this matter, he"
1125,FOOTNOTES:,"followed a set and conscious purpose of his own mind, or whether he"
1126,FOOTNOTES:,only fed the appetite of his hearers with what he found to be agreeable
1127,FOOTNOTES:,"to them, is little material to the question. The great fact stands,"
1128,FOOTNOTES:,"that there was either a design to fulfil, or, at least, an appetite to"
1129,FOOTNOTES:,feed--an intense desire to create bonds and relations with the past--to
1130,FOOTNOTES:,"grasp its events, and fasten them in forms which might become, and"
1131,FOOTNOTES:,"might make them become, the property of the present and the future."
1132,FOOTNOTES:,"Without this great sign of nobleness in their nature, Greeks never"
1133,FOOTNOTES:,could have been Greeks.
1134,FOOTNOTES:,
1135,FOOTNOTES:,I have particularly in view the great multitude of genealogies;
1136,FOOTNOTES:,"their extraordinary consistency one with another, and with the other"
1137,FOOTNOTES:,historical indications of the poems; their extension to a very large
1138,FOOTNOTES:,"number, especially in the Catalogue, of secondary persons; I take"
1139,FOOTNOTES:,"again the Catalogue itself, that most remarkable production, as a"
1140,FOOTNOTES:,whole; the accuracy with which the names of the various races are
1141,FOOTNOTES:,handled and bestowed throughout the poems; the particularity of the
1142,FOOTNOTES:,demands regularly made upon strangers for information concerning
1143,FOOTNOTES:,"themselves, and especially the constant inquiry who were their parents,"
1144,FOOTNOTES:,"what was, for each person as he appears, _his_ relation to the past?"
1145,FOOTNOTES:,"and further, the numerous legends or narratives of prior occurrences"
1146,FOOTNOTES:,"with which the poems, and particularly the more historic Iliad, is so"
1147,FOOTNOTES:,thickly studded. Even the national use of patronymics as titles of
1148,FOOTNOTES:,"honour is in itself highly significant of the historic turn. Nay, much"
1149,FOOTNOTES:,that touches the general structure of the poem may be traced in part
1150,FOOTNOTES:,to this source; for all the intermediate Books between the Wrath and
1151,FOOTNOTES:,"the Return of Achilles, while they are so contrived as to heighten the"
1152,FOOTNOTES:,"military grandeur of the hero, are so many tributes to the special and"
1153,FOOTNOTES:,local desires in each state or district for commemoration of their
1154,FOOTNOTES:,"particular chiefs, which Homer would, of course, have to meet, as he"
1155,FOOTNOTES:,itinerated through the various parts of Greece.
1156,FOOTNOTES:,
1157,FOOTNOTES:,"Now, this appetite for commemoration does not fix itself upon what"
1158,FOOTNOTES:,is imaginary; it may tolerate fiction by way of accessory and
1159,FOOTNOTES:,"embellishment, but in the main it must, from its nature, rely upon"
1160,FOOTNOTES:,"what it takes to be solid food. The actions of great men in all times,"
1161,FOOTNOTES:,"but especially in early times, afford it suitable material; and there"
1162,FOOTNOTES:,is nothing irrational in believing that the race which in its infancy
1163,FOOTNOTES:,"produced so marvellous a poet as Homer, should also in its infancy"
1164,FOOTNOTES:,"have produced great warriors and great statesmen. Composing, with such"
1165,FOOTNOTES:,"powers as his, about his own country, and for his own countrymen,"
1166,FOOTNOTES:,"he could scarcely fail, even independently of conscious purpose,"
1167,FOOTNOTES:,to convey to us a great mass of such matter as is in reality of the
1168,FOOTNOTES:,"very highest historic truth and value. If, indeed, we advance so far"
1169,FOOTNOTES:,as to the conviction that his hearers believed him to be reciting
1170,FOOTNOTES:,"historically, the main question may speedily be decided. For each"
1171,FOOTNOTES:,"generation of men, possessed of the mental culture necessary in order"
1172,FOOTNOTES:,"to appreciate Homer, knows too much of the generations immediately"
1173,FOOTNOTES:,preceding to admit of utter and wholesale imposition. But it is a fair
1174,FOOTNOTES:,"inference from the Odyssey, that the Trojan War was thus sung to the"
1175,FOOTNOTES:,men and the children of the men who waged it. Four lays of bards[13]
1176,FOOTNOTES:,"are mentioned in that poem; one of Phemius, three of Demodocus; and out"
1177,FOOTNOTES:,"of the four, three relate to the War, which appears to show clearly"
1178,FOOTNOTES:,that its celebrity must have been both instantaneous and overpowering;
1179,FOOTNOTES:,"the more so, as the only remaining one has reference not to any human"
1180,FOOTNOTES:,"transaction, but to a scene in Olympus. And I shall shortly advert"
1181,FOOTNOTES:,"to the question, whether the Homeric poems themselves were in all"
1182,FOOTNOTES:,probability composed not later than within two generations of the War
1183,FOOTNOTES:,itself.
1184,FOOTNOTES:,
1185,FOOTNOTES:,"It may be true that, with respect to some parts of his historical"
1186,FOOTNOTES:,"notices, the poet, adapting himself to the wishes and tastes of his"
1187,FOOTNOTES:,"hearers, might take liberties without fear of detection, most of all"
1188,FOOTNOTES:,"where he has filled in accessories, in order to complete a picture;"
1189,FOOTNOTES:,but I think we should be wrong in supposing that in the interest of
1190,FOOTNOTES:,"his art he would have occasion to make this a general practice, or"
1191,FOOTNOTES:,to carry it in historical subjects beyond matters of detail. Nor can
1192,FOOTNOTES:,I wholly disregard the analogy between his history and his equally
1193,FOOTNOTES:,"copious and everywhere intermixed geographical notices: such of them,"
1194,FOOTNOTES:,"I mean, as lay within the sphere of Greek experience. These indeed, he"
1195,FOOTNOTES:,"could not, under the eyes of the men who heard him, cast into the mould"
1196,FOOTNOTES:,of fiction; yet there could be no call of popular necessity for his
1197,FOOTNOTES:,"unequalled and most minute precision, and it can only be accounted for"
1198,FOOTNOTES:,by the belief that accurate record was a great purpose of his poems. If
1199,FOOTNOTES:,"he was thus careful to record both classes of particulars alike, and"
1200,FOOTNOTES:,"if, as to the one, we absolutely know that he has recorded them with"
1201,FOOTNOTES:,"exemplary fidelity, that fact raises a corresponding presumption of"
1202,FOOTNOTES:,some weight as to the other.
1203,FOOTNOTES:,
1204,FOOTNOTES:,"But there is, I think, another argument to the same effect, of the"
1205,FOOTNOTES:,highest degree of strength which the nature of the case admits. It
1206,FOOTNOTES:,is to be found in the fact that Homer has not scrupled to make some
1207,FOOTNOTES:,sacrifices of poetical beauty and propriety to these historic aims. For
1208,FOOTNOTES:,if any judicious critic were called upon to specify the chief poetical
1209,FOOTNOTES:,"blemish of the Iliad, would he not reply by pointing to the multitude"
1210,FOOTNOTES:,"of stories from the past, having no connexion, or at best a very"
1211,FOOTNOTES:,"feeble one, with the War, which are found in it? Such brief and minor"
1212,FOOTNOTES:,"legends as occur in the course of the Catalogue, may have a poetical"
1213,FOOTNOTES:,purpose; it appears not improbable that they may be introduced by way
1214,FOOTNOTES:,of relief to the dryness of topographical and local enumeration. But in
1215,FOOTNOTES:,general the narratives of prior occurrences are (so to speak) rather
1216,FOOTNOTES:,"foisted in, and we must therefore suppose for them a purpose over and"
1217,FOOTNOTES:,"above that, which as a mere poet Homer would have in view. It is hard"
1218,FOOTNOTES:,"to conceive that he would have indulged in them, if he had not been"
1219,FOOTNOTES:,"able to minister to this especial aim by its means. Thus, again, the"
1220,FOOTNOTES:,curious and important genealogy of the Dardanian House[14] is given by
1221,FOOTNOTES:,"Æneas, in answer to Achilles, who had just shown by his taunt that"
1222,FOOTNOTES:,"he, at least, did not want the information, but knew very well[15]"
1223,FOOTNOTES:,"the claims and pretensions of his antagonist. Again, the long story"
1224,FOOTNOTES:,"told by Agamemnon, in the assembly held for the Reconciliation, when"
1225,FOOTNOTES:,"despatch was of all things requisite, may best be accounted for by the"
1226,FOOTNOTES:,desire to relate the circumstances attending the birth of the great
1227,FOOTNOTES:,"national hero, Hercules. It certainly impedes the action of the poem,"
1228,FOOTNOTES:,which seems to be confessed in the rebuke insinuated by the reply of
1229,FOOTNOTES:,Achilles:--
1230,FOOTNOTES:,
1231,FOOTNOTES:,νῦν δὲ μνησώμεθα χάρμης
1232,FOOTNOTES:,αἶψα μάλ’· οὐ γὰρ χρὴ κλοτοπεύειν ἐνθάδ’ ἐόντας
1233,FOOTNOTES:,οὐδὲ διατρίβειν· ἔτι γὰρ μέγα ἔργον ἄρεκτον.[16]
1234,FOOTNOTES:,
1235,FOOTNOTES:,"Still more is this the case when Patroclus, sent in a hurry for news"
1236,FOOTNOTES:,"by a man of the most fiery impatience, is (to use the modern phrase)"
1237,FOOTNOTES:,"button-held by Nestor, in the eleventh Book, and, though he has ‘no"
1238,FOOTNOTES:,"time to sit down,’ yet is obliged to endure a speech of a hundred and"
1239,FOOTNOTES:,"fifty-two lines, ninety-three of which, containing the account of the"
1240,FOOTNOTES:,"Epean contest with Pylos, are absolutely and entirely irrelevant."
1241,FOOTNOTES:,"It may be said, that these effusions are naturally referable to the"
1242,FOOTNOTES:,"garrulous age of Nestor, and to false shame and want of ingenuousness"
1243,FOOTNOTES:,"in Agamemnon. In part, too, we may compare them with the modern"
1244,FOOTNOTES:,fashion among Orientals of introducing parables in common discourse.
1245,FOOTNOTES:,But many of these have no parabolic force whatever: and from all of
1246,FOOTNOTES:,"them poetical beauty suffers. On the other hand, the historic matter"
1247,FOOTNOTES:,introduced is highly curious and interesting for the Greek races:
1248,FOOTNOTES:,"why, then, should we force upon Homer the charge of neglect, folly,"
1249,FOOTNOTES:,"or drowsiness,[17] when an important purpose for these interpolations"
1250,FOOTNOTES:,appears to lie upon the very face of them?
1251,FOOTNOTES:,
1252,FOOTNOTES:,"It will be observed, that if this reasoning in reference to the"
1253,FOOTNOTES:,"interlocutory legends be sound, it supplies an historical character to"
1254,FOOTNOTES:,the poem just in the places where the general argument for it would
1255,FOOTNOTES:,have been weakest; inasmuch as these legends generally relate to
1256,FOOTNOTES:,"times one or two generations earlier than the Troica, and are farther"
1257,FOOTNOTES:,"removed, by so much of additional interval, from the knowledge and"
1258,FOOTNOTES:,experience of his hearers.
1259,FOOTNOTES:,
1260,FOOTNOTES:,"But, over and above the episodes, which seem to owe their place in the"
1261,FOOTNOTES:,"poem to the historic aim, there are a multitude of minor shadings which"
1262,FOOTNOTES:,"run through it, and which, as Homer could have derived no advantage"
1263,FOOTNOTES:,"from feigning them, we are compelled to suppose real. They are part"
1264,FOOTNOTES:,"of the graceful finish of a true story, but they have not the showy"
1265,FOOTNOTES:,"character of what has been invented for effect. Why, for instance,"
1266,FOOTNOTES:,"should Homer say of Clytæmnestra, that till corrupted by Ægisthus she"
1267,FOOTNOTES:,was good?[18] Why should it be worth his while to pretend that the iron
1268,FOOTNOTES:,ball offered by Achilles for a prize was the one formerly pitched by
1269,FOOTNOTES:,Eetion?[19] Why should he spend eight lines in describing the dry trunk
1270,FOOTNOTES:,round which the chariots were to drive?[20] Why should he tell us that
1271,FOOTNOTES:,Tydeus was of small stature?[21] Why does Menelaus drive a mare?[22]
1272,FOOTNOTES:,"Why has Penelope a sister Iphthime, ‘who was wedded to Eumelus,’ wanted"
1273,FOOTNOTES:,for no other purpose than as a _persona_ for Minerva in a dream?[23]
1274,FOOTNOTES:,"These questions, every one will admit, might be indefinitely multiplied."
1275,FOOTNOTES:,
1276,FOOTNOTES:,"But, after all, there can be no point more important for the decision"
1277,FOOTNOTES:,"of this question, than the general tone of Homer himself. Is he, for"
1278,FOOTNOTES:,"ethical and intellectual purposes, the child of that heroic age which"
1279,FOOTNOTES:,he describes? Does he exhibit its form and pressure? Does he chant in
1280,FOOTNOTES:,its key? Are there a set of ideas of the writer which are evidently
1281,FOOTNOTES:,"not those of his heroes, or of his heroes which are not those of"
1282,FOOTNOTES:,"the writer, or does he sing, in the main, as Phemius and Demodocus"
1283,FOOTNOTES:,"might themselves have sung? Wachsmuth says well, that Homer must be"
1284,FOOTNOTES:,regarded as still within the larger boundaries of the heroic age.
1285,FOOTNOTES:,"There are, perhaps, signs, particularly in the Odyssey, of a first"
1286,FOOTNOTES:,stage of transition from it; but the poet is throughout identified
1287,FOOTNOTES:,"with it in heart, soul, speech, and understanding. I would presume to"
1288,FOOTNOTES:,argue thus; that Homer never would have ventured to dispense with mere
1289,FOOTNOTES:,"description, and to adopt action as his sole resource--to dramatise"
1290,FOOTNOTES:,his poem as he has dramatised it--unless he had been strong in the
1291,FOOTNOTES:,consciousness of this identity. It is no answer to say that later
1292,FOOTNOTES:,"writers--namely, the tragedians--dramatised the subject still more,"
1293,FOOTNOTES:,and presented their characters on the stage without even those slender
1294,FOOTNOTES:,"aids from interjected narrative towards the comprehension of them,"
1295,FOOTNOTES:,"which Homer has here and there, at any rate, permitted himself to"
1296,FOOTNOTES:,"use. For the consequence has been in their case, that they entirely"
1297,FOOTNOTES:,"fail to represent the semblance of a picture of the heroic age, or"
1298,FOOTNOTES:,indeed of any age at all. They produce remote occurrences or fables
1299,FOOTNOTES:,"in a dress of feelings, language, and manners suited to their own"
1300,FOOTNOTES:,"time, as far as it is suited to any. Besides, as dramatists, they had"
1301,FOOTNOTES:,immense aids and advantages of other kinds; not to mention their grand
1302,FOOTNOTES:,"narrative auxiliary, the Chorus. But Homer enjoyed little aid from"
1303,FOOTNOTES:,"accessories, and has notwithstanding painted the very life. And yet,"
1304,FOOTNOTES:,"seeking to paint from the life, he commits it to his characters to"
1305,FOOTNOTES:,paint themselves and one another. Surely he never could have confined
1306,FOOTNOTES:,"himself to this indirect process, unless he had been emboldened by the"
1307,FOOTNOTES:,consciousness of his own essential unity with them all. He would have
1308,FOOTNOTES:,"done as most other epic poets have done, whose personages we feel that"
1309,FOOTNOTES:,"we know, not from themselves, but from what the poet in the character"
1310,FOOTNOTES:,of intelligencer has been kind enough to tell us; whereas we learn
1311,FOOTNOTES:,"Achilles by means of Achilles, Ulysses by means of Ulysses, and so with"
1312,FOOTNOTES:,"the rest. Next to their own light, is the light they reflect on one"
1313,FOOTNOTES:,"another; but we never see the poet, so to speak, holding the candle."
1314,FOOTNOTES:,"Still, in urging all this, I feel that more remains and must remain"
1315,FOOTNOTES:,"unspoken. The question, whether Homer speaks and paints essentially"
1316,FOOTNOTES:,"in the spirit of his own age, or whether he fetches from a distance"
1317,FOOTNOTES:,"both his facts and a manner so remarkably harmonizing with them, must"
1318,FOOTNOTES:,after all our discussions continue one to be settled in the last resort
1319,FOOTNOTES:,"not by arguments, which can only play a subsidiary part, but first"
1320,FOOTNOTES:,by the most thorough searching and sifting of the text; then by the
1321,FOOTNOTES:,"application of that inward sense and feeling, to which the critics of"
1322,FOOTNOTES:,"the destructive schools, with their ἀναποδεικταὶ φάσεις, make such"
1323,FOOTNOTES:,copious appeals.
1324,FOOTNOTES:,
1325,FOOTNOTES:,But the assumption by an effort of mind of the manners and tone of
1326,FOOTNOTES:,"a remote age, joined with the consistent support of this character"
1327,FOOTNOTES:,"throughout prolonged works, is of very rare occurrence. In Greek"
1328,FOOTNOTES:,"literature there is nothing, to my knowledge, which at all approaches"
1329,FOOTNOTES:,it; and this I think may fairly be urged as of itself almost conclusive
1330,FOOTNOTES:,"against ascribing it to Homer. The later tragedians, in whose"
1331,FOOTNOTES:,"compositions we should look for it, do not apparently so much as think"
1332,FOOTNOTES:,of it; and it is most difficult to suppose a poet so national as Homer
1333,FOOTNOTES:,to be in this cardinal respect entirely different from all others of
1334,FOOTNOTES:,his race. Indeed the supposition is radically at variance with the
1335,FOOTNOTES:,idea of his poetical character; of which the very groundwork lies in a
1336,FOOTNOTES:,"childlike unconsciousness, and in the unity of Art with Nature[24]."
1337,FOOTNOTES:,
1338,FOOTNOTES:,"May we not, however, go a good deal further, and say boldly that the"
1339,FOOTNOTES:,"faculty of assuming in literary compositions an archaic costume, voice,"
1340,FOOTNOTES:,"and manner, does not belong at all either to an age like that of Homer,"
1341,FOOTNOTES:,or to any age of which the literary conditions at all resemble it?
1342,FOOTNOTES:,
1343,FOOTNOTES:,"In the first place, an inventor, working like Homer for the general"
1344,FOOTNOTES:,"public, must, by departing altogether from the modes of thought,"
1345,FOOTNOTES:,"expression, and action current in his own day, _pro tanto_ lose his"
1346,FOOTNOTES:,hold upon those on whose approval he depends. It seems to follow that
1347,FOOTNOTES:,"this will not be seriously attempted, except in an age which has"
1348,FOOTNOTES:,ceased to afford a liberal supply of the materials of romance. Is not
1349,FOOTNOTES:,"this presumption made good by experience? The Greek tragedians, it is"
1350,FOOTNOTES:,"indisputable, did not find it necessary to aim, and did not aim, at"
1351,FOOTNOTES:,"reproducing the whole contemporary apparatus, which was in strictness"
1352,FOOTNOTES:,appropriate and due to their characters. Virgil made no such attempt in
1353,FOOTNOTES:,"the Æneid, of which, notwithstanding the manners abound in anachronisms"
1354,FOOTNOTES:,"of detail. The romance poets of Italy idealize their subject, not,"
1355,FOOTNOTES:,"however, by the revival of antique manners with their proper apparatus"
1356,FOOTNOTES:,"of incidents, but by means of an abundant preternatural machinery."
1357,FOOTNOTES:,"Even in Shakespeare’s King John, Henry IV, or Henry VIII, how little"
1358,FOOTNOTES:,"difference can be detected from the Elizabethan age, or (in this point)"
1359,FOOTNOTES:,"from one another[25]. Again, in Macbeth or Lear, enough is done"
1360,FOOTNOTES:,to prevent our utterly confounding their ages with the common life
1361,FOOTNOTES:,of the hearers; but there is nothing that approaches to a complete
1362,FOOTNOTES:,characteristic representation of the respective times to which the
1363,FOOTNOTES:,"personages are supposed to belong. So, again, in Coriolanus, Julius"
1364,FOOTNOTES:,"Cæsar, or Antony and Cleopatra, there is a sort of Roman _toga_ thrown"
1365,FOOTNOTES:,loosely over the figures; but we do not feel ourselves amidst Roman
1366,FOOTNOTES:,"life when we read them. And, in truth, what is done at all in these"
1367,FOOTNOTES:,"cases is not done so much by reproducing as by generalizing, in the"
1368,FOOTNOTES:,same sense as a painter generalizes his draperies. A great instance
1369,FOOTNOTES:,of the genuine process of reproduction is to be found in Sir Walter
1370,FOOTNOTES:,"Scott. He, however, besides being a man of powerful genius, cast not"
1371,FOOTNOTES:,"in the mould of his own age, but in one essentially belonging to the"
1372,FOOTNOTES:,"past, was a master of antiquarian knowledge. And this leads me to"
1373,FOOTNOTES:,name what seems to be the second condition of serious and successful
1374,FOOTNOTES:,"attempts (I need not here speak of burlesques, of which all the touches"
1375,FOOTNOTES:,must be broad ones) at disinterring and reviving bygone ages in the
1376,FOOTNOTES:,"whole circle and scheme of their life. The first, as has been already"
1377,FOOTNOTES:,"said, is to live in an age itself socially old, so as not to abound in"
1378,FOOTNOTES:,"proper materials for high invention. The second is, to live in an age"
1379,FOOTNOTES:,possessed of such abundant documents and records of a former time as to
1380,FOOTNOTES:,make it practicable to explore it in all points by historical _data_.
1381,FOOTNOTES:,"This condition was wanting to Virgil, even supposing him to have had"
1382,FOOTNOTES:,"the necessary tastes and qualifications. It was not wanting to Scott,"
1383,FOOTNOTES:,"with reference especially to the period of the Stuarts, who, besides"
1384,FOOTNOTES:,"a vast abundance of oral and written traditions, had laws, usages,"
1385,FOOTNOTES:,"architecture, arms, coins, utensils, every imaginable form of relic"
1386,FOOTNOTES:,"and of testimony at his command, so that he could himself first live"
1387,FOOTNOTES:,"in the age of his works, and then, when himself acclimatised, invent"
1388,FOOTNOTES:,according to it.
1389,FOOTNOTES:,
1390,FOOTNOTES:,In all this it is not forgotten that a certain amount of archaism is
1391,FOOTNOTES:,indispensable in all works purporting to draw their subject from a
1392,FOOTNOTES:,"long-past age. But this _minimum_ need only be slight and general,"
1393,FOOTNOTES:,as in the Æneid; and it consists rather in the exclusion of modern
1394,FOOTNOTES:,"accessories, than in the revival of the original tone. And again,"
1395,FOOTNOTES:,"the very choice of subject, as it is grave and severe or light and"
1396,FOOTNOTES:,"gay, will to some extent influence the manners: the former will"
1397,FOOTNOTES:,"spontaneously lean towards the past, the latter, depending on the zest"
1398,FOOTNOTES:,"of novelty, will be more disposed to clothe itself in the forms of the"
1399,FOOTNOTES:,"present. Thus we have a more antique tone in Henry the Fifth, than in"
1400,FOOTNOTES:,the Merry Wives of Windsor. But archaic colouring within limits such as
1401,FOOTNOTES:,these is broadly different from such systematic representation of the
1402,FOOTNOTES:,"antique as Homer must have practised, if he had practised it at all."
1403,FOOTNOTES:,
1404,FOOTNOTES:,"As in romance and poetry, so in the progress of the drama, this"
1405,FOOTNOTES:,method appears to be the business of a late age. The strength of
1406,FOOTNOTES:,dramatic imagination is always when the drama itself is young. It
1407,FOOTNOTES:,then confidently relies upon its essential elements for the necessary
1408,FOOTNOTES:,"illusion; it knows little, and cares less, about sustaining it by"
1409,FOOTNOTES:,elaborate attention to minor emblems and incidents. But when it has
1410,FOOTNOTES:,"lived into the old age of civilized society, when the critical faculty"
1411,FOOTNOTES:,"has become strong and the imagination weak, then it strengthens"
1412,FOOTNOTES:,"itself by minute accuracy in scenery and costume,--in fact, by exact"
1413,FOOTNOTES:,reproduction. This is indeed the novel gift of our own time: and by
1414,FOOTNOTES:,means of it theatrical revivals are now understood and practised among
1415,FOOTNOTES:,"ourselves in a manner which former generations could not emulate, but"
1416,FOOTNOTES:,did not require.
1417,FOOTNOTES:,
1418,FOOTNOTES:,"Nor must we forget the importance, with reference to this discussion,"
1419,FOOTNOTES:,"of Homer’s minuteness, precision, and multitude of details. Every one"
1420,FOOTNOTES:,"of these, be it remembered, if we suppose him not to be painting from"
1421,FOOTNOTES:,"the life, affords an additional chance of detection, by the discrepancy"
1422,FOOTNOTES:,"between the life habitually present to the poet’s experience, and that"
1423,FOOTNOTES:,which he is representing by effort. But the voice of the Homeric poems
1424,FOOTNOTES:,"is in this respect, after all, unisonous, like that of the Greeks,"
1425,FOOTNOTES:,"and not multiform, like that of the Trojan army[26]. We are driven,"
1426,FOOTNOTES:,"therefore, to suppose that Homer practised this art of reproduction on"
1427,FOOTNOTES:,"a scale, as well as with a success, since unheard of, and this at a"
1428,FOOTNOTES:,"period when, according to all likelihood and all other experience, it"
1429,FOOTNOTES:,could only in a very limited sense be possible to practice it at all.
1430,FOOTNOTES:,"The extravagance of these suppositions tells powerfully against them,"
1431,FOOTNOTES:,and once more throws us back on the belief that the objects which he
1432,FOOTNOTES:,"painted were, in the main, those which his own age placed beneath his"
1433,FOOTNOTES:,view.
1434,FOOTNOTES:,
1435,FOOTNOTES:,"This view of the historical character of Homer, I believe,"
1436,FOOTNOTES:,substantially agrees with that taken by the Greeks in general. If I
1437,FOOTNOTES:,"refer to Strabo, in his remarkable Prolegomena[27], it is because he"
1438,FOOTNOTES:,had occasion to consider the point particularly. Eratosthenes had
1439,FOOTNOTES:,treated the great sire of poets as a fabulist. Strabo confutes him.
1440,FOOTNOTES:,Eratosthenes had himself noticed the precision of the geographical
1441,FOOTNOTES:,"details: Thisbe, with its doves; Haliartus and its meadows; Anthedon,"
1442,FOOTNOTES:,the boundary; Lilæa by the sources of Cephissus; and Strabo retorts
1443,FOOTNOTES:,upon him with force--πότερον οὖν ὁ ποιῶν ταῦτα ψυχαγωγοῦντι ἔοικεν ἢ
1444,FOOTNOTES:,"διδάσκοντι; his general conclusion is, that Homer used fiction, as his"
1445,FOOTNOTES:,smith in the Odyssey used gold for plating silver:--
1446,FOOTNOTES:,
1447,FOOTNOTES:,"ὡς δ’ ὅτε τις χρυσὸν περιχεύεται ἀργύρῳ ἀνὴρ,"
1448,FOOTNOTES:,
1449,FOOTNOTES:,that so Homer adjoined mythical ornaments to true events. But history
1450,FOOTNOTES:,"was the basis:--ἔλαβεν οὖν παρὰ τῆς ἱστορίας τὰς ἀρχάς[28]. And, in"
1451,FOOTNOTES:,adopting the belief that Homer is to be taken generally for a most
1452,FOOTNOTES:,"trustworthy witness to facts, I am far from saying that there are no"
1453,FOOTNOTES:,"cases of exception, where he may reasonably be suspected of showing"
1454,FOOTNOTES:,less than his usual fidelity. The doctrine must be accepted with
1455,FOOTNOTES:,"latitude: the question is not whether it is absolutely safe, but"

1476,FOOTNOTES:,"of transactions, but whether he has truly and faithfully represented"
1477,FOOTNOTES:,"manners and characters, feelings and tastes, races and countries,"
1478,FOOTNOTES:,principles and institutions. Here lies the pith of history; these it
1479,FOOTNOTES:,"has for its soul, and fact for its body. It does not appear to me"
1480,FOOTNOTES:,reasonable to presume that Homer idealized his narration with anything
1481,FOOTNOTES:,like the license which was permitted to the Carlovingian romance; yet
1482,FOOTNOTES:,even that romance did not fail to retain in many of the most essential
1483,FOOTNOTES:,"particulars a true historic character; and it conveys to us, partly by"
1484,FOOTNOTES:,"fact and partly through a vast parable, the inward life of a period"
1485,FOOTNOTES:,pregnant with forces that were to operate powerfully upon our own
1486,FOOTNOTES:,characters and condition. Even those who would regard the cases as
1487,FOOTNOTES:,"parallel should, therefore, remember that they too must read Homer"
1488,FOOTNOTES:,"otherwise than as a poet in the vulgar and more prevailing sense, which"

1538,FOOTNOTES:,"any given number of years before the Olympiads, but simply his relation"
1539,FOOTNOTES:,"in the order of history to the heroic age; to the events, and, above"
1540,FOOTNOTES:,"all, to the living type of that age."
1541,FOOTNOTES:,
1542,FOOTNOTES:,When asserting generally the historic aims and authority of the
1543,FOOTNOTES:,"poet, I do not presume to pronounce confidently upon the difficult"
1544,FOOTNOTES:,question of the period at which he lived. I prefer to dwell upon the
1545,FOOTNOTES:,"proposition that he is an original witness to manners, characters, and"
1546,FOOTNOTES:,"ideas such as those of his poems. It is not necessary, to make good"
1547,FOOTNOTES:,"this proposition, that we should determine a given number of years"
1548,FOOTNOTES:,as the maximum that could have passed between the Trojan war and the
1549,FOOTNOTES:,composition of the Iliad or Odyssey. But the internal evidence seems to
1550,FOOTNOTES:,"me very strongly to support the belief, that he lived before the Dorian"
1551,FOOTNOTES:,conquest of the Peloponnesus. That he was not an eye-witness of the
1552,FOOTNOTES:,"war, we absolutely know from the Invocation before the Catalogue[29]."
1553,FOOTNOTES:,It also appears[30] that he must have seen the grandchildren of Æneas
1554,FOOTNOTES:,reigning over the land of Priam. It is no extravagant supposition that
1555,FOOTNOTES:,"forty or fifty years after the siege, perhaps even less, might have"
1556,FOOTNOTES:,brought this to pass.
1557,FOOTNOTES:,
1558,FOOTNOTES:,"The single idea or form of expression in the poems, which at first"
1559,FOOTNOTES:,"sight tends to suggest a very long interval, is that quoted by Velleius"
1560,FOOTNOTES:,"Paterculus[31], the οἷοι νῦν βροτοί εἰσι[32]. But the question arises,"
1561,FOOTNOTES:,"whether this is an historical land-mark, or a poetical embellishment?"
1562,FOOTNOTES:,"In the former sense, as implying a great physical degeneracy of"
1563,FOOTNOTES:,"mankind, it would require us to suppose nothing less than a lapse"
1564,FOOTNOTES:,of centuries between the Troica and the epoch of the poet. This
1565,FOOTNOTES:,"hypothesis, though Heyne speaks of the eighth or ninth generation[33],"
1566,FOOTNOTES:,"general opinion has rejected. If it be dismissed, and if we adopt"
1567,FOOTNOTES:,"the view of this formula as an ornament, it loses all definite"
1568,FOOTNOTES:,"chronological significance. Thus it is lost in the phrase, common in"
1569,FOOTNOTES:,our own time with respect to the intellectual characters of men now
1570,FOOTNOTES:,"no more, but yet not removed from us, perhaps, by more than from a"
1571,FOOTNOTES:,"quarter to half a century--‘there were giants in those days.’ Nay,"
1572,FOOTNOTES:,"the observation of Paterculus, especially as he was an enthusiastic"
1573,FOOTNOTES:,"admirer, itself exemplifies the little care with which these questions"
1574,FOOTNOTES:,have been treated. For the Iliad itself supplies a complete answer in
1575,FOOTNOTES:,"the speech of Nestor, who draws the very same contrast between the"
1576,FOOTNOTES:,heroes of the Troica and those of his own earlier days:
1577,FOOTNOTES:,
1578,FOOTNOTES:,κείνοισι δ’ ἂν οὔτις
1579,FOOTNOTES:,τῶν οἱ νῦν βροτοί εἰσιν ἐπιχθονίων μαχέοιτο[34].
1580,FOOTNOTES:,
1581,FOOTNOTES:,"And it is curious that we have in these words a measure, supplied by"
1582,FOOTNOTES:,"Homer himself, of the real force of the phrase, which seems to fix it"
1583,FOOTNOTES:,"at something under half a century, and thus makes it harmonise with"
1584,FOOTNOTES:,the indication afforded by the passage relating to the descendants of
1585,FOOTNOTES:,Æneas. The argument of Mitford[35] on the age of Homer appears to me
1586,FOOTNOTES:,"to be of great value: and, while it is rejected, it is not answered"
1587,FOOTNOTES:,by Heyne[36]. Nor is it easy to conceive the answer to those who urge
1588,FOOTNOTES:,"that, so far as the poet’s testimony goes, the years from Pirithous"
1589,FOOTNOTES:,to the siege are as many as from the siege to his own day[37]. But
1590,FOOTNOTES:,"Pirithous was the father of Polypætes, who led a Thessalian division in"
1591,FOOTNOTES:,the war.[38]
1592,FOOTNOTES:,
1593,FOOTNOTES:,"If this view of Homer’s meaning in the particular case be correct,"
1594,FOOTNOTES:,"we can the better understand why it is that the poet, who uses this"
1595,FOOTNOTES:,"form of enhancement four times in the Iliad, does not employ it in the"
1596,FOOTNOTES:,"Odyssey, though it is the later poem, and though he had opportunities"
1597,FOOTNOTES:,"enough; such as the athletic exploits of Ulysses in Phæacia, and"
1598,FOOTNOTES:,especially the handling of the Bow in Ithaca. For in the Iliad a more
1599,FOOTNOTES:,"antique tone of colouring prevails, as it is demanded by the loftier"
1600,FOOTNOTES:,strain of the action.
1601,FOOTNOTES:,
1602,FOOTNOTES:,"There is one passage, and one only, which is just capable of being"
1603,FOOTNOTES:,construed as an allusion to the great Dorian conquest: it is that in
1604,FOOTNOTES:,"the Fourth Book of the Iliad, where Juno tells Jupiter that she well"
1605,FOOTNOTES:,"knows he can destroy in spite of her, whensoever he may choose, her"
1606,FOOTNOTES:,"three dearest cities, Argos, Sparta, and Mycenæ[39]. It is probable"
1607,FOOTNOTES:,that the passage refers to sacking such as had been practised by
1608,FOOTNOTES:,"Hercules[40], and such as is pathetically described by Phœnix[41]."
1609,FOOTNOTES:,"But, in the first place, we do not know that these cities were in any"
1610,FOOTNOTES:,"sense destroyed by the Dorian conquest, more than they had been by"
1611,FOOTNOTES:,"previous dynastic and territorial changes. If, on the other hand, it"
1612,FOOTNOTES:,"be contended, that we need not construe the passage as implying more"
1613,FOOTNOTES:,"than revolution independent of material destruction, then we need"
1614,FOOTNOTES:,not introduce the idea of the Dorian conquest at all to sustain the
1615,FOOTNOTES:,"propriety of the passage, for Homer already knew by tradition how those"
1616,FOOTNOTES:,"cities, and the territory to which they belonged, had changed hands"
1617,FOOTNOTES:,"from Danaïds to Perseids, and from Perseids to Pelopids."
1618,FOOTNOTES:,
1619,FOOTNOTES:,But indications even far less equivocal from an isolated passage
1620,FOOTNOTES:,"would be many times outweighed, in a case like that of Homer, by any"
1621,FOOTNOTES:,"conclusion justly drawn from features, whether positive or negative,"
1622,FOOTNOTES:,that are rooted in the general body of the poems. Now such a conclusion
1623,FOOTNOTES:,arises from the admitted and total absence of any allusion in Homer
1624,FOOTNOTES:,"to the general incidents of the great Dorian conquest, and to the"
1625,FOOTNOTES:,"consequent reconstruction of the old or European Greece, or to the"
1626,FOOTNOTES:,"migrations eastward, or to the very existence of the new Asiatic Greece"
1627,FOOTNOTES:,which it is supposed to have called into being. Respecting the conquest
1628,FOOTNOTES:,"itself, he might by a sustained effort of deliberate intention have"
1629,FOOTNOTES:,kept silence: but is it possible that he could have avoided betraying
1630,FOOTNOTES:,"by reference to results, on a thousand occasions, his knowledge of a"
1631,FOOTNOTES:,change which had drawn anew the whole surface of society in Greece? It
1632,FOOTNOTES:,"would be more rational, were we driven to it (which is not the case),"
1633,FOOTNOTES:,"even to suppose that the passage in question had been tampered with,"
1634,FOOTNOTES:,than to imagine that the poet could have forborne through twenty-eight
1635,FOOTNOTES:,"thousand lines, to make any other reference to, or further betray his"
1636,FOOTNOTES:,"knowledge of, events which must on this supposition have occupied for"
1637,FOOTNOTES:,him so large a part of the whole horizon of life and experience.
1638,FOOTNOTES:,
1639,FOOTNOTES:,"Again, the allusions to the trumpet and the riding-horse found in"
1640,FOOTNOTES:,"illustrative passages, but not as used in the war, are by far too"
1641,FOOTNOTES:,"slight and doubtful, to sustain the theory that Homer saw around him a"
1642,FOOTNOTES:,system of warfare different from that which he recorded; and require
1643,FOOTNOTES:,"us to adopt no supposition for the explanation of them, beyond the"
1644,FOOTNOTES:,"very natural one that the heroic poet, without essentially changing"
1645,FOOTNOTES:,"manners, yet, within certain limits, insensibly projects himself and"
1646,FOOTNOTES:,his subject from the foreground of every-day life into the mellowness
1647,FOOTNOTES:,"of distance; and, therefore, that he may advisedly have excluded from"
1648,FOOTNOTES:,"his poem certain objects or practices, which notwithstanding he knew"
1649,FOOTNOTES:,"to have been more or less in use. Again, what are we to say to the"
1650,FOOTNOTES:,"minute knowledge of Greece proper and the Peloponnesus, which Homer has"
1651,FOOTNOTES:,displayed? Why does he (apparently) know it so much better than he knew
1652,FOOTNOTES:,"Asia Minor? How among the rude Dorians, just emerged from comparative"
1653,FOOTNOTES:,"barbarism, could he learn it at all? How strange, that Lycurgus"
1654,FOOTNOTES:,should have acquired the fame of having first introduced the poems to
1655,FOOTNOTES:,"the Peloponnesus, unless a great revolution and a substitution of one"
1656,FOOTNOTES:,"dominant race for another had come between, to obliterate or greatly"
1657,FOOTNOTES:,"weaken the recollection of them in the very country, which beyond all"
1658,FOOTNOTES:,others they covered with a blaze of glory.
1659,FOOTNOTES:,
1660,FOOTNOTES:,Of the very small number of passages in the poems which contain a
1661,FOOTNOTES:,"reference to events later than the action, there are two, both relating"
1662,FOOTNOTES:,"to the same subject, for which at first sight it appears difficult"
1663,FOOTNOTES:,to account. Why does Neptune obtrude upon the Olympian Court his
1664,FOOTNOTES:,"insignificant and rather absurd jealousy, lest the work of defence,"
1665,FOOTNOTES:,"hastily thrown up by the Achæan army, should eclipse the wall built"
1666,FOOTNOTES:,around Troy by Apollo and himself? Evidently in order to obtain from
1667,FOOTNOTES:,"Jupiter the suggestion, that he should subsequently himself efface all"
1668,FOOTNOTES:,traces of it. But why does Homer show this anxiety to account for its
1669,FOOTNOTES:,"non-appearance? Why does he return subsequently to the subject, and"
1670,FOOTNOTES:,"most carefully relate how Jupiter by raining, and Apollo by turning the"
1671,FOOTNOTES:,"mouths of eight rivers, and Neptune with his trident, all cooperated to"
1672,FOOTNOTES:,"destroy the work, and make the shore smooth and even again? Had Homer"
1673,FOOTNOTES:,"lived many generations after the Trojan war, these passages would have"
1674,FOOTNOTES:,"been entirely without purpose, for he need not then have given reasons"
1675,FOOTNOTES:,"to show, why ages had left no trace still visible of the labour of"
1676,FOOTNOTES:,"a day. But if he lived near the period of the war, the case is very"
1677,FOOTNOTES:,"different. He might then be challenged by his maritime hearers, who,"
1678,FOOTNOTES:,"if they frequented the passage into the Sea of Marmora, would have had"
1679,FOOTNOTES:,"clear views of the camp of Agamemnon, and who would naturally require"
1680,FOOTNOTES:,him to assign a cause for the disappearance even of such a work as
1681,FOOTNOTES:,"a day’s labour of the army could produce, and as the Trojan soldiery"
1682,FOOTNOTES:,could make practicable for their chariots to drive over[42].
1683,FOOTNOTES:,
1684,FOOTNOTES:,These particular indications appear to be worth considering: but the
1685,FOOTNOTES:,great reasons for placing the date of Homer very near to that of the

1823,FOOTNOTES:,and refined taste of Lord Aberdeen. Yet this was not enough.

1827,FOOTNOTES:,
1828,FOOTNOTES:,The ordeal of time has not destroyed the value of Mr. Payne Knight’s
1829,FOOTNOTES:,"Prolegomena, but it has been decidedly unfavourable to his text as a"
1830,FOOTNOTES:,practical attempt at reconstruction. With the old text in the right
1831,FOOTNOTES:,"hand, and Mr. Knight’s in the left, who would doubt in which to look"
1832,FOOTNOTES:,for the nearest likeness to Homer? Or who will ever again venture to
1833,FOOTNOTES:,publish an abridged or re-modelled Iliad?
1834,FOOTNOTES:,
1835,FOOTNOTES:,"Apart, however, from the unsatisfactoriness of the results of"
1836,FOOTNOTES:,"attempts at reconstruction, have we reason to believe that the text"
1837,FOOTNOTES:,"of Homer has, as a whole, been seriously vitiated by interpolation"
1838,FOOTNOTES:,or corruption? The difficulties attending its transmission from the
1839,FOOTNOTES:,time of the poet are not to be denied. But I think we have scarcely
1840,FOOTNOTES:,"enough considered the amount of means which were available, and which"
1841,FOOTNOTES:,"were actually employed, in order to neutralize those difficulties,"
1842,FOOTNOTES:,and achieve the task. Although writing of some description appears to
1843,FOOTNOTES:,"have existed at the epoch of the Poems, it can be probably proved,"
1844,FOOTNOTES:,"and may at any rate be fully admitted, that Homer did not write, but"
1845,FOOTNOTES:,recited only. This is the first step: now for the second. I pass by
1846,FOOTNOTES:,"the argument with those, who deny that poems of this length could be"
1847,FOOTNOTES:,"transmitted orally at all, as one already disposed of by the general"
1848,FOOTNOTES:,"verdict of the world. So, likewise, I leave behind me, at the point"
1849,FOOTNOTES:,"where Mure has placed them, all the reasonings of the _piecers_, who"
1850,FOOTNOTES:,"say that there were originally a number of Iliadic and Odyssean songs,"
1851,FOOTNOTES:,afterwards made up into the poems such as we now have them: of the
1852,FOOTNOTES:,"_amplifiers_, who look upon them as expanded respectively by gradual"
1853,FOOTNOTES:,interpolations and additions from an original of small dimensions; of
1854,FOOTNOTES:,"the _separators_, who will have just two Homers and no more, one for"
1855,FOOTNOTES:,"the Iliad, and one for the Odyssey. I assume for the present purpose"
1856,FOOTNOTES:,the contrary of all these three propositions: and simply invite those
1857,FOOTNOTES:,"who disbelieve them, but who also conceive that the text is generally"
1858,FOOTNOTES:,"unsafe and untrustworthy in its detail, to some consideration of that"
1859,FOOTNOTES:,subject.
1860,FOOTNOTES:,
1861,FOOTNOTES:,In attempting to weigh retrospectively the probable fortunes of the
1862,FOOTNOTES:,"Homeric text, I presume that we may establish as our point of departure"
1863,FOOTNOTES:,"the judgment delivered by Heyne[46], that the manuscripts of Homer are"
1864,FOOTNOTES:,"satisfactory: that we possess all, or nearly all, that the Alexandrian"
1865,FOOTNOTES:,"critics possessed; and that by the advance of the critical art, we"
1866,FOOTNOTES:,"have now probably, on the whole, a better and truer Homer than that of"
1867,FOOTNOTES:,"Aristarchus, which is the basis of the modern text. The imperfect state"
1868,FOOTNOTES:,"of notation when writing first began to be used, and the changes in"
1869,FOOTNOTES:,"pronunciation, have not, we may also suppose with Heyne[47], done more"
1870,FOOTNOTES:,than trifling or secondary damage to the copies.
1871,FOOTNOTES:,
1872,FOOTNOTES:,"The first serious question is this; how far was Homer mutilated, first,"
1873,FOOTNOTES:,"by the rhapsodists, or reciters, before he was put into writing, and"
1874,FOOTNOTES:,"secondly, by those who, in order to bring the lays of the Iliad into"
1875,FOOTNOTES:,"one body, must, it is assumed, have added and altered much, even if"
1876,FOOTNOTES:,"they had no whims of their own, and only sought to do what was needful"
1877,FOOTNOTES:,"_nexûs et juncturæ causâ_. It is, of course, admitted that these lays,"
1878,FOOTNOTES:,"even though ideally one as they came from their framer, were in many"
1879,FOOTNOTES:,"cases actually separated. And Heyne quotes the Scholiast of Pindar[48],"
1880,FOOTNOTES:,complaining by report that Cinæthus and his school had interpolated
1881,FOOTNOTES:,"largely, as well as the passage in which Josephus[49] (so he states)"
1882,FOOTNOTES:,"gives it as his opinion that the Iliad, from having been pieced"
1883,FOOTNOTES:,"together long after it was composed, presented many discrepancies."
1884,FOOTNOTES:,"Now, even if this were the opinion of Josephus, it would have no more"
1885,FOOTNOTES:,"pretension to historical authority, than if it had been delivered"
1886,FOOTNOTES:,"yesterday. But the fact is, that Josephus mentions it simply as a"
1887,FOOTNOTES:,current notion; φασὶν οὐδὲ τοῦτον ... ἀλλὰ διαμνημονευομένην ... καὶ
1888,FOOTNOTES:,"διὰ τοῦτο πολλὰς ἐν αὐτῇ σχεῖν τὰς διαφωνίας. Indeed, it cannot be too"
1889,FOOTNOTES:,"carefully borne in mind, that if the positive notices of Homer in early"
1890,FOOTNOTES:,"times are slight, so as to throw us back very much upon the poems for"
1891,FOOTNOTES:,"their own vindication, yet, on the other hand, all the authorities"
1892,FOOTNOTES:,"cited on the sceptical side, are chronologically so remote from the"
1893,FOOTNOTES:,"question in debate, that they are but opinions and not proofs, and that"
1894,FOOTNOTES:,"we may canvass and question them without the smallest scruple, or fear"
1895,FOOTNOTES:,that we are pitting mere theory against legitimate evidence.
1896,FOOTNOTES:,
1897,FOOTNOTES:,"It is not to be denied that the condition of the Homeric poems,"
1898,FOOTNOTES:,"before they were committed to writing, was one of great danger. But"
1899,FOOTNOTES:,"the question may well be asked, how came poems of such length to"
1900,FOOTNOTES:,be preserved at all by mere oral transmission through a period of
1901,FOOTNOTES:,"undefined, and possibly of very great, length? It is plain that nothing"
1902,FOOTNOTES:,"but an extraordinary celebrity, and a passionate attachment on the part"
1903,FOOTNOTES:,"of the people, could have kept them alive. Now, if we suppose this"
1904,FOOTNOTES:,"celebrity and this attachment, let us inquire further, whether they"
1905,FOOTNOTES:,"may not have supplied the means of neutralizing and counteracting, in"
1906,FOOTNOTES:,"the main, the dangers to which the poems were exposed; and whether"
1907,FOOTNOTES:,"it is unreasonable to say, That which _could_ have preserved them in"
1908,FOOTNOTES:,"their unity at all, _must_, in all likelihood, have preserved them"
1909,FOOTNOTES:,in a tolerably genuine state. Fully admitting that the evidence in
1910,FOOTNOTES:,"the case is imperfect, and can only lead to disputable conclusions, I"
1911,FOOTNOTES:,"nevertheless ask, What is the most probable supposition respecting the"
1912,FOOTNOTES:,condition of the Homeric poems in the pre-historic times of Greece?
1913,FOOTNOTES:,"Is it not this--that, with due allowance for a different state of"
1914,FOOTNOTES:,"circumstances, they were then, what they were in later times; the"
1915,FOOTNOTES:,broad basis of mental culture; the great monument of the glory of the
1916,FOOTNOTES:,"nation, and of each particular State or race; the prime entertainment"
1917,FOOTNOTES:,of those prolonged festive gatherings which were so characteristic of
1918,FOOTNOTES:,early Greece; that they were not only the special charge and pride
1919,FOOTNOTES:,"of particular poetical schools, but distinct objects of the care of"
1920,FOOTNOTES:,legislators and statesmen; that in this manner they were recognised as
1921,FOOTNOTES:,"among the institutions of the country, and that they had thus to depend"
1922,FOOTNOTES:,"for their transmission, not only on the fire of national and poetic"
1923,FOOTNOTES:,"feeling, but upon a jealous custody much resembling that which even a"
1924,FOOTNOTES:,comparatively rude people gives to its laws?
1925,FOOTNOTES:,
1926,FOOTNOTES:,I shall attempt a summary of the arguments and testimonies which appear
1927,FOOTNOTES:,"to me to recommend, if they do not compel, the adoption of these"
1928,FOOTNOTES:,conclusions.
1929,FOOTNOTES:,
1930,FOOTNOTES:,"1. Heraclides Ponticus, a pupil of Plato, in a fragment περὶ πολιτειῶν,"
1931,FOOTNOTES:,declares that Lycurgus was the first to bring the poetry of Homer
1932,FOOTNOTES:,"into Peloponnesus: τὴν Ὁμήρου ποίησιν, παρὰ τῶν ἀπογόνων Κρεοφύλου"
1933,FOOTNOTES:,"λαβὼν, πρῶτος διεκόμισεν εἰς Πελοπόννησον. This testimony is late"
1934,FOOTNOTES:,"with reference to the fact it reports, but not late in the history"
1935,FOOTNOTES:,of Greek literature. Of the source from which it was derived by the
1936,FOOTNOTES:,"author who gives it us, we know nothing. No light is thrown upon it by"
1937,FOOTNOTES:,"Ælian,[50] who adds the epithet ἀθρόαν to ποίησιν. Plutarch enlarges"
1938,FOOTNOTES:,"the expression of the tradition, but seems to add little to its matter,"
1939,FOOTNOTES:,except that some portions of Homer were known before Lycurgus brought
1940,FOOTNOTES:,"the whole from Crete.[51] It is stated in the Republic of Plato,[52]"
1941,FOOTNOTES:,that Creophylus was a companion of Homer. Strabo[53] informs us that
1942,FOOTNOTES:,"he was a Samian; and Hermodamas, the master of Pythagoras, is said"
1943,FOOTNOTES:,"by Diogenes Laertius[54] to have been his descendant. Now, we cannot"
1944,FOOTNOTES:,call any part of these statements history; but they exhibit a body
1945,FOOTNOTES:,"of tradition, of which the members, drawn from scattered quarters,"
1946,FOOTNOTES:,"agree with one another, and agree also with the general probability"
1947,FOOTNOTES:,that arises out of a fact so astonishing as is in itself the actual
1948,FOOTNOTES:,preservation of the poems of Homer. It is in truth this fact that
1949,FOOTNOTES:,lays the best ground for traditions such as the one in question. If
1950,FOOTNOTES:,"they came before us artificially complete and embellished, that might"
1951,FOOTNOTES:,"be made a ground of suspicion. But appearing, as this one does, with"
1952,FOOTNOTES:,"an evident absence of design, there is every presumption of its truth."
1953,FOOTNOTES:,"Before considering the full force which attaches to it if it be true,"
1954,FOOTNOTES:,we will draw out the kindred traditions.
1955,FOOTNOTES:,
1956,FOOTNOTES:,"2. Of these, the next, and a most important one, is the statement of"
1957,FOOTNOTES:,"Herodotus respecting Clisthenes, the ruler of Sicyon, who, when he"
1958,FOOTNOTES:,"had been at war with Argos, ῥαψῳδοὺς ἔπαυσε ἐν Σικυῶνι ἀγωνίζεσθαι,"
1959,FOOTNOTES:,"τῶν Ὁμηρείων ἐπέων εἵνεκα, ὅτι Ἀργεῖοί τε καὶ Ἄργος τὰ πολλὰ πάντα"
1960,FOOTNOTES:,"ὑμνέαται[55]. He proceeds to say, that Clisthenes sought to banish the"
1961,FOOTNOTES:,"memory of Adrastus, as being an Argive hero, from Sicyon. It is not"
1962,FOOTNOTES:,necessary to inquire what these Homeric poems may have included; but
1963,FOOTNOTES:,"the conclusion of Grote, that they were ‘the Thebais and the Epigoni,"
1964,FOOTNOTES:,"not the Iliad[56],’ seems to me incredible. Nor is it correct that"
1965,FOOTNOTES:,the Iliad fails to supply matter to which the statement may refer. In
1966,FOOTNOTES:,"the Iliad, the name of Argos, though meaning it is true the country"
1967,FOOTNOTES:,"rather than a city, is nearly associated with the chief seat of power,"
1968,FOOTNOTES:,and becomes representative of the whole Hellenic race in its heroic
1969,FOOTNOTES:,"infancy. This is surely honour infinitely higher, than any local fame"
1970,FOOTNOTES:,"it could derive from the civil feud with Thebes. The Iliad, too, marks"
1971,FOOTNOTES:,most clearly the connexion of Adrastus with Argos--for it names Diomed
1972,FOOTNOTES:,"as the husband of his daughter or granddaughter, Ægialea[57]; it also"
1973,FOOTNOTES:,"marks the subordinate position of Sicyon,"
1974,FOOTNOTES:,
1975,FOOTNOTES:,"ὅθ’ ἄρ’ Ἄδρηστος πρῶτ’ ἐμβασίλευεν[58],"
1976,FOOTNOTES:,
1977,FOOTNOTES:,"by making it a mere town in the dominions of Agamemnon, while Argos"
1978,FOOTNOTES:,figures as a sovereign and powerful city. There may therefore perhaps
1979,FOOTNOTES:,be room to doubt whether Herodotus meant even to include the Thebais or
1980,FOOTNOTES:,Epigoni in the phrase ‘Homeric poems.’
1981,FOOTNOTES:,
1982,FOOTNOTES:,But the importance of the passage is not wholly dependent on these
1983,FOOTNOTES:,"considerations. It shows,"
1984,FOOTNOTES:,
1985,FOOTNOTES:,"_a._ That there were, at Sicyon, State-recitations of Homer six"
1986,FOOTNOTES:,"centuries before the Christian era, attended with rewards for the"
1987,FOOTNOTES:,successful performers.
1988,FOOTNOTES:,
1989,FOOTNOTES:,_b._ That these recitations were in conformity with common use; for
1990,FOOTNOTES:,"they are named as something ordinary and established, which was then"
1991,FOOTNOTES:,"set aside, not as a custom peculiar to Sicyon."
1992,FOOTNOTES:,
1993,FOOTNOTES:,"_c._ That the recitations depended upon the Homeric poems, since they"
1994,FOOTNOTES:,were entirely stopped on account of exceptionable matter which the
1995,FOOTNOTES:,Homeric poems were deemed to contain.
1996,FOOTNOTES:,
1997,FOOTNOTES:,_d._ That these recitations were in the nature of competitive contests
1998,FOOTNOTES:,"among the rhapsodists, when the best and most approved, of course,"
1999,FOOTNOTES:,"would obtain prizes. This implies that the recitations were not single,"
2000,FOOTNOTES:,"as if by poet laureates, but that many shared in them."
2001,FOOTNOTES:,
2002,FOOTNOTES:,"3. Next to this tradition, and nearly coeval with it, but reported by"
2003,FOOTNOTES:,"later authority, is that respecting Solon and Athens. Dieuchidas of"
2004,FOOTNOTES:,"Megara, an author of uncertain age, placed by Heyne[59] later than"
2005,FOOTNOTES:,"Alexander, is quoted in Diogenes Laertius[60] as testifying to the"
2006,FOOTNOTES:,following effect concerning Solon: τά τε Ὁμήρου ἐξ ὑποβολῆς γέγραφε
2007,FOOTNOTES:,"ῥαψῳδεῖσθαι. οἷον ὅπου ὁ πρῶτος ἔληξεν, ἐκεῖθεν ἄρχεσθαι τὸν ἐχόμενον."
2008,FOOTNOTES:,"μᾶλλον οὖν Σόλων Ὅμηρον ἐφώτισεν, ἢ Πεισίστρατος. But we have also a"
2009,FOOTNOTES:,"better witness, I think, in Lycurgus the orator, contemporary with"
2010,FOOTNOTES:,"Demosthenes,[61] who gives a most striking account of the political"
2011,FOOTNOTES:,"and martial use of the Homeric songs. He says, οὕτω γὰρ ὑπέλαβον ὑμῶν"
2012,FOOTNOTES:,"οἱ πατέρες σπουδαῖον εἶναι ποιήτην, ὥστε νόμον ἔθεντο καθ’ ἑκάστην"
2013,FOOTNOTES:,πενταετηρίδα τῶν Παναθηναίων μόνου τῶν ἄλλων ποιήτων ῥαψωδεῖσθαι τὰ
2014,FOOTNOTES:,"ἔπη. ‘It was with these songs in their ears,’ he proceeds, ‘that your"
2015,FOOTNOTES:,"fathers fought at Marathon; and so valiant were they _then_, that from"
2016,FOOTNOTES:,"among them their brave rivals, the Lacedæmonians, sought a general,"
2017,FOOTNOTES:,Tyrtæus.’
2018,FOOTNOTES:,
2019,FOOTNOTES:,"_a._ Now, these words appear to carry the traditional origin of this"
2020,FOOTNOTES:,"law, as far as the authority of Lycurgus will avail, back to the early"
2021,FOOTNOTES:,"part of the seventh century, when Tyrtæus lived.[62]"
2022,FOOTNOTES:,
2023,FOOTNOTES:,"_b._ Thus, at the period when Athens is just beginning to rise towards"
2024,FOOTNOTES:,"eminence, she enacts a law that the poems of Homer shall be recited at"
2025,FOOTNOTES:,her greatest festival.
2026,FOOTNOTES:,
2027,FOOTNOTES:,_c._ This honour she accords to Homer (whatever that name may have
2028,FOOTNOTES:,imported) alone among poets.
2029,FOOTNOTES:,
2030,FOOTNOTES:,"_d._ This appears, from the connexion with Tyrtæus, to be a tradition"
2031,FOOTNOTES:,of a matter older still than the one mentioned by Dieuchidas. But
2032,FOOTNOTES:,the two are in thorough accordance. For Dieuchidas does not say that
2033,FOOTNOTES:,"Solon introduced the recitations of Homer, nor does he refer simply"
2034,FOOTNOTES:,"to the Panathenaica. He pretty clearly implies, that Solon did not"
2035,FOOTNOTES:,"begin the recitations, but that he reformed--(by bringing them into"
2036,FOOTNOTES:,"regular succession, which implies a fixed order of the songs)--what had"
2037,FOOTNOTES:,been introduced already; while Lycurgus seems to supply the notice of
2038,FOOTNOTES:,the original introduction as having occurred before the time even of
2039,FOOTNOTES:,Tyrtæus.
2040,FOOTNOTES:,
2041,FOOTNOTES:,"4. The argument from the sculptures on the chest of Cypselus,"
2042,FOOTNOTES:,"representing subjects taken out of the Iliad, refers to a period nearly"
2043,FOOTNOTES:,"corresponding with that of Tyrtæus, as Cypselus was probably born about"
2044,FOOTNOTES:,B. C. 700: and tends to show that the Iliad was famous in Corinth at
2045,FOOTNOTES:,that date.[63]
2046,FOOTNOTES:,
2047,FOOTNOTES:,5. The next of the specific traditions is that relating to Pisistratus.
2048,FOOTNOTES:,To his agency it has been the fashion of late years to assign an
2049,FOOTNOTES:,"exaggerated, or even an exclusive, importance. But whereas the"
2050,FOOTNOTES:,"testimonies respecting Lycurgus, Clisthenes, and Solon, (as well as the"
2051,FOOTNOTES:,"Athenian legislators before him,) are derived from authors probably,"
2052,FOOTNOTES:,"or certainly, of the fourth and fifth centuries B. C., we have none at"
2053,FOOTNOTES:,all respecting Pisistratus earlier than the Augustan age.[64] Cicero
2054,FOOTNOTES:,says he first disposed the Homeric books in their present order;
2055,FOOTNOTES:,"Pausanias,[65] that he collected them, διεσπασμένα τε καὶ ἀλλαχοῦ"
2056,FOOTNOTES:,"μνημονευόμενα; Josephus,[66] who, as we have seen, merely refers to the"
2057,FOOTNOTES:,report that the Iliad was not committed to writing until after Homer’s
2058,FOOTNOTES:,"time, is wrongly quoted[67] as a witness to the labours of Pisistratus."
2059,FOOTNOTES:,"An ancient Scholion, recently discovered,[68] names four poets who"
2060,FOOTNOTES:,"worked under that prince. And it may be admitted, that the traditions"
2061,FOOTNOTES:,respecting Pisistratus have this distinctive mark--that they seem to
2062,FOOTNOTES:,indicate the first accomplishment of a critical and literary task upon
2063,FOOTNOTES:,Homer’s text under the direct care and responsibility of the sovereign
2064,FOOTNOTES:,of the country.
2065,FOOTNOTES:,
2066,FOOTNOTES:,"Thus, the testimony concerning Pisistratus is of an order decidedly"
2067,FOOTNOTES:,"inferior to that which supports the earlier traditions, and cannot with"
2068,FOOTNOTES:,propriety be put into the scale against them where they are in conflict
2069,FOOTNOTES:,with it; but there is no reason to reject the report that he fixed the
2070,FOOTNOTES:,"particular order of the poems, which the law of Solon may have left"
2071,FOOTNOTES:,"open in some degree to the judgment of the reciters, although they were"
2072,FOOTNOTES:,required by it to recite in order.
2073,FOOTNOTES:,
2074,FOOTNOTES:,"6. The dialogue, doubtfully ascribed to Plato under the name of"
2075,FOOTNOTES:,"Hipparchus, states that that sovereign--"

2080,FOOTNOTES:,
2081,FOOTNOTES:,"As regards the matter of original introduction, this passage"
2082,FOOTNOTES:,contradicts all the foregoing ones. From the uncertainty who is its
2083,FOOTNOTES:,"author, it must yield to them as of less authority. But this is not"
2084,FOOTNOTES:,"all. It is on the very face of it incredible: for it asserts, not that"
2085,FOOTNOTES:,"his poetry was first arranged or adjusted, but first brought into"
2086,FOOTNOTES:,the country by Hipparchus. This is in itself absurd: and it is also
2087,FOOTNOTES:,"directly in the teeth of the statement, which can hardly be a pure"
2088,FOOTNOTES:,"fiction, that Solon by law required the poems of Homer to be recited"
2089,FOOTNOTES:,"at the Panathenæa. As regards the succession in reciting, it is quite"
2090,FOOTNOTES:,possible that he may have put the last hand to the work of his father.
2091,FOOTNOTES:,
2092,FOOTNOTES:,"However, the passage may deserve notice as a sign of the general belief"
2093,FOOTNOTES:,"that the care of the poems of Homer, and provision for their orderly"
2094,FOOTNOTES:,"publication in the only mode then possible, was a fit and usual part of"
2095,FOOTNOTES:,the care of States and their rulers.
2096,FOOTNOTES:,
2097,FOOTNOTES:,The whole mass of the passages which have been cited may be thought to
2098,FOOTNOTES:,bear primarily on the controversies which I have waived. But they have
2099,FOOTNOTES:,"a most important, even if secondary, bearing upon the question, whether"
2100,FOOTNOTES:,the received text is generally sound in its structure. The dangers
2101,FOOTNOTES:,which menaced that text of course were referable to two sources: the
2102,FOOTNOTES:,"one, want of due care; and the other, falsification for a purpose: and"
2103,FOOTNOTES:,it is necessary to bring into one view the whole positive evidence
2104,FOOTNOTES:,"with respect to the preservation and publication of the Homeric poems,"
2105,FOOTNOTES:,in order to estimate the amount both of these dangers and of the
2106,FOOTNOTES:,safeguards against them. I resume the prosecution of this task.
2107,FOOTNOTES:,
2108,FOOTNOTES:,"From the word ἀγωνίζεσθαι, applied by Herodotus to the recitations at"
2109,FOOTNOTES:,"Sicyon, it is plain that they were matches among the rhapsodists. And"
2110,FOOTNOTES:,as the match did not in the main depend upon the original compositions
2111,FOOTNOTES:,"of the candidates, but on the repetition of what Homer was reputed to"
2112,FOOTNOTES:,"have composed, the question arises, on what grounds could the prize be"
2113,FOOTNOTES:,"adjudged? Partly, perhaps, for the voice and manner of the rhapsodist;"
2114,FOOTNOTES:,"but partly also, nay, we must assume principally, for his comparative"
2115,FOOTNOTES:,"fidelity to the supposed standard of his original. And, when we"
2116,FOOTNOTES:,"consider the length of the poems, we may the more easily understand"
2117,FOOTNOTES:,how the retentiveness of memory required to give an adequate command
2118,FOOTNOTES:,"of them, might well deserve and receive reward. True, the vanity of"
2119,FOOTNOTES:,a particular rhapsodist might readily induce him to suppose that he
2120,FOOTNOTES:,could improve upon Homer. But surely such an one would be subject to
2121,FOOTNOTES:,"no inconsiderable check from the vigilance, and the impartial, or"
2122,FOOTNOTES:,"more probably the jealous, judgment of his contemporaries and rivals."
2123,FOOTNOTES:,"The aberrations, too, or interpolations, of each one inventor, would"
2124,FOOTNOTES:,be immediately crossed by those of every other; and the intrinsic
2125,FOOTNOTES:,"superiority of the great poet himself, and the extraordinary reverence"
2126,FOOTNOTES:,"paid to his name, would thus derive powerful aid from the natural play"
2127,FOOTNOTES:,of human passions. I look upon the circumstance that these recitations
2128,FOOTNOTES:,"were competitive, and probably open to all comers, as one of the utmost"
2129,FOOTNOTES:,"importance. Freedom, in such a case, would be far more conservative"
2130,FOOTNOTES:,than restriction.
2131,FOOTNOTES:,
2132,FOOTNOTES:,"The force of such considerations is abated indeed, but it is not"
2133,FOOTNOTES:,"destroyed, by the fact that poems not composed by Homer were esteemed"
2134,FOOTNOTES:,to be Homeric. We have no means of knowing whether this false
2135,FOOTNOTES:,estimation reached in general beyond the character of mere vulgar
2136,FOOTNOTES:,"rumour. We find, indeed, that Callinus ascribed the Thebais to Homer,"
2137,FOOTNOTES:,"Thucydides the Pythian Hymn, and Aristotle the Margites. But, of these"
2138,FOOTNOTES:,"three, the last judgment, for all we know, may have been a true one."
2139,FOOTNOTES:,"The Thebais was judged by Pausanias to be the best of the epics, after"
2140,FOOTNOTES:,"the Iliad and Odyssey. It does not therefore follow, that because a"
2141,FOOTNOTES:,"poet might assign this to him, he would also have assigned others. Few"
2142,FOOTNOTES:,authors show more slender marks of critical acumen than Herodotus;
2143,FOOTNOTES:,but even he treats the notions that the Cyprian epic or the Epigoni
2144,FOOTNOTES:,"belonged to Homer in terms such as to show, that they were at most mere"
2145,FOOTNOTES:,"speculations, and not established public judgments.[70]"
2146,FOOTNOTES:,
2147,FOOTNOTES:,"Now, even in a critical age, it seems to be inevitable, that authors"
2148,FOOTNOTES:,"of conspicuous popularity shall be followed on their path, not only"

2150,FOOTNOTES:,"success, by forgers. We see, in the present day, attempts to vent"
2151,FOOTNOTES:,"new novels under the name of Walter Scott. I have myself a volume,"
2152,FOOTNOTES:,"purchased in Italy, of spurious verses, printed under the name of"
2153,FOOTNOTES:,"her great, though not yet famous, modern poet, Giacomo Leopardi. In"
2154,FOOTNOTES:,"periods far less critical, impostors would be bolder, and dupes more"
2155,FOOTNOTES:,"numerous. But it cannot be shown that a number of other epics, or even"
2156,FOOTNOTES:,"that any single one, had been generally ascribed to Homer with the same"
2157,FOOTNOTES:,"confidence as the Iliad and Odyssey; nor that the same care, public or"
2158,FOOTNOTES:,"private, was taken in any other case for the keeping and restoration of"
2159,FOOTNOTES:,the text.
2160,FOOTNOTES:,
2161,FOOTNOTES:,"Again, though the Spartan and Athenian traditions take no specific"
2162,FOOTNOTES:,"notice of competition, yet we are justified in supposing that it"
2163,FOOTNOTES:,"existed, because the practice can be traced to an antiquity more remote"
2164,FOOTNOTES:,than any of them. It is true that in Homer we have no example of
2165,FOOTNOTES:,competition among bards actually exhibited; but neither do the poems
2166,FOOTNOTES:,furnish us with an occasion when it might have been looked for. The
2167,FOOTNOTES:,ordinary place of the bard was as a member of a king’s or chieftain’s
2168,FOOTNOTES:,"household. At the great assemblages of tribes, or of the Greek race, to"
2169,FOOTNOTES:,"which the chiefs repaired in numbers, more bards than one would also"
2170,FOOTNOTES:,probably appear. Some light is thrown upon this subject by the passage
2171,FOOTNOTES:,relating to Thamyris in the second Book of the Iliad.[71] He met his
2172,FOOTNOTES:,"calamity at Dorion, when on a journey; and it caught him Οἰχαλίηθεν"
2173,FOOTNOTES:,ἰόντα παρ’ Εὐρύτου Οἰχαλιῆος. Homer’s usual precision justifies our
2174,FOOTNOTES:,"arguing that, when he says he came, not simply from a place, but also"
2175,FOOTNOTES:,"from, or from beside, the lord of a place, the meaning is, that he was"
2176,FOOTNOTES:,"attached to that lord as the bard of his court or household. Again,"
2177,FOOTNOTES:,"he was on a journey. Whither bound, except evidently to one of these"
2178,FOOTNOTES:,"contests? This is fully shown by the lines that follow, for they"
2179,FOOTNOTES:,contemplate a match as then about to take place forthwith. For the
2180,FOOTNOTES:,"form of his boast was not simply that he could beat the Muses, but (to"
2181,FOOTNOTES:,"speak in our phraseology) he vauntingly vowed that he would win, even"
2182,FOOTNOTES:,though the Muses themselves should be his rivals.
2183,FOOTNOTES:,
2184,FOOTNOTES:,"στεῦτο γὰρ εὐχόμενος νικήσεμεν, εἴπερ ἂν αὐταὶ"
2185,FOOTNOTES:,Μοῦσαι ἀείδοιεν.
2186,FOOTNOTES:,
2187,FOOTNOTES:,"Institutions which embrace competition have, from the character of"
2188,FOOTNOTES:,"man’s nature, a great self-sustaining power; and there is no reason to"
2189,FOOTNOTES:,suppose that between the time of Thamyris and that of the Sicyonian
2190,FOOTNOTES:,rhapsodists this method of recitation had at any time fallen into
2191,FOOTNOTES:,"abeyance. In a fragment of Hesiod[72], quoted by the Scholiast on"
2192,FOOTNOTES:,"Pindar, we find the phrase ῥάπτειν ἀοιδήν; but on account of its"
2193,FOOTNOTES:,"mention of Homer as a contemporary, this fragment is untrustworthy."
2194,FOOTNOTES:,"In other places, however, he distinctly witnesses to the matches and"
2195,FOOTNOTES:,"prizes of the bards, and says that at the match held by Amphidamas"
2196,FOOTNOTES:,"in Aulis, he himself won a tripod[73]. Again, Thucydides finds an"
2197,FOOTNOTES:,unequivocal proof of the competition of bards in the beautiful passage
2198,FOOTNOTES:,which he quotes from the very ancient _Hymn_ to Apollo[74].
2199,FOOTNOTES:,
2200,FOOTNOTES:,I do not think it needful to dwell in detail upon the means privately
2201,FOOTNOTES:,taken for the transmission of the Homeric songs. Cinæthus of Chios
2202,FOOTNOTES:,"(according to the Scholiast on Pindar[75], quoting Hippostratus, a"
2203,FOOTNOTES:,"Sicilian author of uncertain date), ἐῤῥαψῴδησε τὰ Ὁμήρου ἔπη (about 500"
2204,FOOTNOTES:,"B.C.), for the first time at Syracuse. It may be observed that this"
2205,FOOTNOTES:,passage may probably imply the foundation of public recitations there.
2206,FOOTNOTES:,"Eustathius[76], quoting, as Heyne[77] observes, inaccurately, charges"
2207,FOOTNOTES:,Cinæthus with having corrupted the Homeric poems; but the words of the
2208,FOOTNOTES:,Scholiast need not mean more than that he composed certain poems and
2209,FOOTNOTES:,threw them into the mass of those which were more or less taken to be
2210,FOOTNOTES:,"Homeric. We need not enlarge upon Creophylus[78], or upon the Homeridæ"
2211,FOOTNOTES:,"mentioned by Pindar, and, according to Strabo, claimed as her own by"
2212,FOOTNOTES:,"Chios[79]. That name appears to be used freely by Plato[80], without"
2213,FOOTNOTES:,"explanation, as if in his own time they formed a well-known school."
2214,FOOTNOTES:,"According to Athenæus[81], quoting Aristocles, a writer of uncertain"
2215,FOOTNOTES:,"date, the name Ὁμηρισταὶ was given to the rhapsodists generally."
2216,FOOTNOTES:,
2217,FOOTNOTES:,The Iliad and the Odyssey were known to Herodotus under their present
2218,FOOTNOTES:,"titles, as we find from his references to them. But it is justly argued"
2219,FOOTNOTES:,"by Heyne, that there must have been known poems of their scope and"
2220,FOOTNOTES:,"subject at the time when the other Cyclic poems were written, which"
2221,FOOTNOTES:,"fill up the interval between them, and complete the Troic story[82];"
2222,FOOTNOTES:,"that is to say, not long after the commencement of the Olympiads."
2223,FOOTNOTES:,
2224,FOOTNOTES:,"Again, it is needless to do more than simply touch upon the relation"
2225,FOOTNOTES:,of Homer to Greek letters and culture in general. He was the source
2226,FOOTNOTES:,"of tragedy, the first text-book of philosophers, and the basis of"
2227,FOOTNOTES:,"liberal education; so much so, that Alcibiades is said to have struck"
2228,FOOTNOTES:,"his schoolmaster for having no MS. rhapsody of the Iliad[83], while"
2229,FOOTNOTES:,Xenophon quotes Niceratus as saying that his father made him learn
2230,FOOTNOTES:,"the Iliad and Odyssey, and that he could repeat the whole of them by"
2231,FOOTNOTES:,"heart[84]. Cassander, king of Macedon, according to Athenæus, could do"
2232,FOOTNOTES:,nearly as much. He had by heart τῶν ἐπῶν τὰ πολλά.[85]
2233,FOOTNOTES:,
2234,FOOTNOTES:,"Passing on from this evidence of general estimation, I come to what is"
2235,FOOTNOTES:,"more important with respect to the question of the text--that is, the"
2236,FOOTNOTES:,"state of the poems at the time of the Alexandrian recensions, as it is"
2237,FOOTNOTES:,"exhibited by Villoison, from the Venetian Scholia on the Iliad which he"
2238,FOOTNOTES:,discovered. From this source appears to me to proceed our best warrant
2239,FOOTNOTES:,for believing in the general soundness of the text.
2240,FOOTNOTES:,
2241,FOOTNOTES:,"The first tendencies of the Alexandrian school, as they are represented"
2242,FOOTNOTES:,"by Zenodotus, appear to have been towards very free excision and"
2243,FOOTNOTES:,"emendation. Aristarchus, its highest authority, is considered to"
2244,FOOTNOTES:,represent a reaction towards more sober handling. The plan of
2245,FOOTNOTES:,expressing suspicion by _obeli_ was a good one--it raised the question
2246,FOOTNOTES:,of genuineness without foreclosing it. The passages which he excluded
2247,FOOTNOTES:,"stand in the text, and many among them are not much damaged by the"
2248,FOOTNOTES:,"condemnation. One particularly, in the speech of Phœnix,[86] appears"
2249,FOOTNOTES:,"to me alike beautiful and characteristic. After all, the _obelos_ is"
2250,FOOTNOTES:,generally attached to lines of amplification and poetic ornament;
2251,FOOTNOTES:,"which could be dispensed with, and yet leave the sense not vitally"
2252,FOOTNOTES:,"mutilated. But we may quote Aristarchus as a witness, on the whole,"
2253,FOOTNOTES:,to the substantial soundness of the text. For it is plain that the
2254,FOOTNOTES:,affirmation of all his doubts would still leave us with the substance
2255,FOOTNOTES:,"of the Iliad as it is; while it seems that the judgment of mankind,"
2256,FOOTNOTES:,"or rather its feeling, which in such a matter is worth more than its"
2257,FOOTNOTES:,"judgment, has refused to go as far as he did, for his doubts or adverse"
2258,FOOTNOTES:,"verdicts are recorded, but the lines and passages remain, are still"
2259,FOOTNOTES:,"read and taught as Homer, and are not pretended to be distinguishable"
2260,FOOTNOTES:,by any broad mark of intrinsic inferiority. It is not meant that the
2261,FOOTNOTES:,soundness of each line has been considered and affirmed to be free
2262,FOOTNOTES:,"from doubt, but that it has been felt that, while clear discrimination"
2263,FOOTNOTES:,"in detail was impracticable, retention was, on the whole, safer than"
2264,FOOTNOTES:,exclusion. Nor is this because a principle of blind credulity has
2265,FOOTNOTES:,"prevailed. On the contrary, the same judgment, feeling, or instinct, be"
2266,FOOTNOTES:,"it what it may, of civilised man, which has found it safest to adhere"
2267,FOOTNOTES:,"to the traditional text of Homer, has likewise thought it safest to"
2268,FOOTNOTES:,rule the case of authorship adversely as to the Hymns. Under all the
2269,FOOTNOTES:,"circumstances, I find no difficulty in understanding such accounts as"
2270,FOOTNOTES:,"that which tells us that the inquiry, which is the best edition of"
2271,FOOTNOTES:,"Homer? was met with the answer, ‘the oldest;’--or such a passage as"
2272,FOOTNOTES:,"that of Lucian,[87] who introduces Homer in the Shades, declaring that"
2273,FOOTNOTES:,"the ἀθετούμεναι στίχες, the suspected and rejected verses, were all"
2274,FOOTNOTES:,"his; whereupon, says Lucian, I recognised the abundant frigidity of the"
2275,FOOTNOTES:,school of Zenodotus and Aristarchus. This is in an ironical work; but
2276,FOOTNOTES:,ironical works are often used as the vehicles of real opinions.
2277,FOOTNOTES:,
2278,FOOTNOTES:,The Venetian Scholiast is full of familiar references to the different
2279,FOOTNOTES:,"editions of the text of the Iliad, as being standards perfectly well"
2280,FOOTNOTES:,"known; and he thus exhibits to us, in a considerable degree, the"
2281,FOOTNOTES:,"materials which the Alexandrian critics found existing, and with which"
2282,FOOTNOTES:,they went to work upon that poem.
2283,FOOTNOTES:,
2284,FOOTNOTES:,"The multitude of editions (ἐκδόσεις) which they had before them,"
2285,FOOTNOTES:,"were partly state editions (αἱ πολιτικαὶ, αἱ κατὰ πόλεις, αἱ διὰ τῶν"
2286,FOOTNOTES:,"πόλεων, αἱ ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων), and partly those due to private care"
2287,FOOTNOTES:,(οἱ κατ’ ἄνδρα). These latter seem to have obtained the name in two
2288,FOOTNOTES:,"ways. The first was, when it was taken from particular editors who"
2289,FOOTNOTES:,"had revised the text, such as Antimachus (contemporary with Plato),"
2290,FOOTNOTES:,"Callimachus, and, above all, Aristotle, who prepared for Alexander the"
2291,FOOTNOTES:,"Great the copy ἐκ νάρθηκος, and, again, the edition of Zenodotus, that"
2292,FOOTNOTES:,"of Aristophanes, and the two separate editions of Aristarchus, all of"
2293,FOOTNOTES:,the Alexandrian school; or else they were named from the persons who
2294,FOOTNOTES:,"possessed them, and for whom they had been prepared by the care of"
2295,FOOTNOTES:,"learned men. Among such possessors was Cassander, king of Macedonia."
2296,FOOTNOTES:,
2297,FOOTNOTES:,The existence of these State editions is a fact full of meaning.
2298,FOOTNOTES:,"It appears to show nothing less than this, that the text was under"
2299,FOOTNOTES:,the charge of the public authorities in the several States. We have
2300,FOOTNOTES:,particular names for six of these editions through the Venetian
2301,FOOTNOTES:,"Scholiast--those of Marseilles, Chios, Cyprus, Crete, Sinope, Argos. On"
2302,FOOTNOTES:,"beholding this list, we are immediately struck by the fact that while"
2303,FOOTNOTES:,"it contains names from the far East, like Sinope, and far West, like"
2304,FOOTNOTES:,"Marseilles, it does not contain one name of a city in Greece Proper,"
2305,FOOTNOTES:,"except Argos, and that a city having perhaps less communion than almost"
2306,FOOTNOTES:,any other considerable place with Greek literature in general. We ask
2307,FOOTNOTES:,"why do not Athens, Sparta, Thebes, Corinth, why do not Syracuse and"
2308,FOOTNOTES:,"the great Greek towns of Sicily and Italy, appear with their several"
2309,FOOTNOTES:,"Homeric texts? The most likely answer appears to be, not that these"
2310,FOOTNOTES:,six enumerated cities were more distinguished than others by the
2311,FOOTNOTES:,"carefulness of their provisions for the safety of the Homeric text, but"
2312,FOOTNOTES:,"that for some reason, possibly from their lying less within the circle"
2313,FOOTNOTES:,"of Greek letters at large, they still retained each their particular"
2314,FOOTNOTES:,"text, whereas an approximation had been made to a common text,--of"
2315,FOOTNOTES:,which the cities most properly Greek in general availed themselves. For
2316,FOOTNOTES:,sometimes there are certain signs supplied in the Scholia of a common
2317,FOOTNOTES:,"text prevailing in the State or national, and another in the private"
2318,FOOTNOTES:,"editions, and this without reference to the six cities above mentioned."
2319,FOOTNOTES:,"In the supposition of such a tendency to divaricate, there is nothing"
2320,FOOTNOTES:,beyond likelihood; for private editors would be more free to follow
2321,FOOTNOTES:,"their own judgments or conjectures, whereas the public curators would"
2322,FOOTNOTES:,"almost, as a matter of course, be more rigidly conservative. At any"
2323,FOOTNOTES:,"rate, there are traceable indications before us to this effect; for the"
2324,FOOTNOTES:,Scholiast cites for particular readings--
2325,FOOTNOTES:,
2326,FOOTNOTES:,"αἱ ἐκ τῶν πόλεων, xxi. 351."
2327,FOOTNOTES:,"αἱ ἀπὸ πόλεων, xxii. 51."
2328,FOOTNOTES:,"αἱ ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων, xix. 386."
2329,FOOTNOTES:,
2330,FOOTNOTES:,and on the other hand--
2331,FOOTNOTES:,
2332,FOOTNOTES:,"αἱ κατ’ ἄνδρα, xxii. 103."
2333,FOOTNOTES:,
2334,FOOTNOTES:,"as well as in other places, τινὲς τῶν πολιτικῶν (e. g. xxiv. 30), and"
2335,FOOTNOTES:,αἱ πλείους τῶν κατ’ ἄνδρα (xxiii. 88). It is therefore likely that
2336,FOOTNOTES:,"there was a national text, approximating to uniformity, and used in"
2337,FOOTNOTES:,"common by those cities, the principal ones of Greece, which are not"
2338,FOOTNOTES:,"quoted as having had texts of their own; for there is no reason, that"
2339,FOOTNOTES:,"I am aware of, to suppose that the phrases αἱ πολιτικαὶ, and the rest"
2340,FOOTNOTES:,"of those equivalent to it, are confined to the six editions. Now, while"
2341,FOOTNOTES:,the six State editions indicate a care probably dating from very early
2342,FOOTNOTES:,"times for the soundness of the text, the common State recension, if,"
2343,FOOTNOTES:,"as appears probable, there was one, indicates a gradual convergence of"
2344,FOOTNOTES:,critical labours and of the public judgment in the generality of those
2345,FOOTNOTES:,"States, of which the people had the oldest, strongest, and most direct"
2346,FOOTNOTES:,interest in the Homeric poems.
2347,FOOTNOTES:,
2348,FOOTNOTES:,"There is a third form of common text, less perfect than either of the"
2349,FOOTNOTES:,"others, of which abundant traces are found. We find mention of the"
2350,FOOTNOTES:,"editions or copies called αἱ κοιναὶ, αἱ δημοτικαὶ, αἱ δημώδεις, and"
2351,FOOTNOTES:,"they are sometimes described collectively, as on Iliad ii. 53, ἐν δὲ"
2352,FOOTNOTES:,"ταῖς κοιναῖς ἐγέγραπτο καὶ τῇ Ζηνοδοτείῳ, βουλήν. Sometimes the greater"
2353,FOOTNOTES:,"part of these κοιναὶ or δημώδεις have a particular reading. They all,"
2354,FOOTNOTES:,"of all classes, varied more or less, and are distinguished according"
2355,FOOTNOTES:,"to their merits, as φαυλαὶ, εἰκαιότεραι, μέτριαι, χαριέσταται. These"
2356,FOOTNOTES:,"ordinary or public (not national) editions, prepared for sale in"
2357,FOOTNOTES:,"the open book-market, were probably founded, in the main, on the"
2358,FOOTNOTES:,"national text, but being intended for general sale, and not prepared"
2359,FOOTNOTES:,"by responsible editors, they were ordinarily inferior. This Venetian"
2360,FOOTNOTES:,"Scholiast was himself a critic, and wrote when the Æolic and Ionic"
2361,FOOTNOTES:,"dialects were still in use, as appears from his references to them.[88]"
2362,FOOTNOTES:,
2363,FOOTNOTES:,The Scholia to the Odyssey supply the names of some editions besides
2364,FOOTNOTES:,"those which have been mentioned. One of these is the Αἰολὶς, or"
2365,FOOTNOTES:,"Αἰολική;[89] another is ἡ ἐκ Μουσείου,[90] which is explained to"
2366,FOOTNOTES:,refer to the depository near the School at Alexandria; and a third ἡ
2367,FOOTNOTES:,"Κυκλικὴ,[91] which is interpreted to mean an edition in which the poems"
2368,FOOTNOTES:,of Homer were placed in a series with those of the Cyclical authors.
2369,FOOTNOTES:,
2370,FOOTNOTES:,"On the one hand, then, it may be readily admitted that the Homeric"
2371,FOOTNOTES:,"poems were exposed, before they were reduced to writing, to the"
2372,FOOTNOTES:,powerful and various action of disintegrating causes. Among these we
2373,FOOTNOTES:,"may name neglect, inability to cope with the real difficulties of their"
2374,FOOTNOTES:,"transmission, the personal vanity of the rhapsodists, and the local"
2375,FOOTNOTES:,"vanity of communities. But I think we have also disclosed to us, both"
2376,FOOTNOTES:,by the fragmentary notices of the history of the poems if taken in
2377,FOOTNOTES:,"their collective effect, and by the state of things in and upon which"
2378,FOOTNOTES:,"the Alexandrian critics laboured, the operation of an immense amount"
2379,FOOTNOTES:,of restorative counter-agency. All chance of our arriving at a sober
2380,FOOTNOTES:,judgment must depend upon our duly weighing these two sets of forces
2381,FOOTNOTES:,"in their relation to one another. There were indeed tendencies, which"
2382,FOOTNOTES:,"may well be called irresistible, to aberrations from the traditional"
2383,FOOTNOTES:,"standard; but there were barriers also insurmountable, which seem to"
2384,FOOTNOTES:,have confined those aberrations within certain limits. They could not
2385,FOOTNOTES:,"proceed beyond a given point without awakening the consciousness,"
2386,FOOTNOTES:,"that Homer, the priceless treasure of Greece, and perhaps the first"
2387,FOOTNOTES:,"source of its keener consciousness of nationality, was in danger of"
2388,FOOTNOTES:,"being disfigured, and deformed, and so lost; and that sense, when once"
2389,FOOTNOTES:,"awakened, without doubt generated such reactions as we find exemplified"
2390,FOOTNOTES:,in the proceedings of Pisistratus.
2391,FOOTNOTES:,
2392,FOOTNOTES:,"We may indeed derive directly, from the force of the destroying"
2393,FOOTNOTES:,"element, when viewed in detail, the strongest proof that there must"
2394,FOOTNOTES:,"have been an original standard, by recurrence to which its ravages"
2395,FOOTNOTES:,could from time to time be repaired. For if that element had worked
2396,FOOTNOTES:,"without such means of correction, I do not see how we could now have"
2397,FOOTNOTES:,been in possession of an Iliad and an Odyssey. As with regard to
2398,FOOTNOTES:,"religions after they are parted from their source, the tendency would"
2399,FOOTNOTES:,have been to continually-increasing divergence. The dissimilarities
2400,FOOTNOTES:,"arising from omission, alteration, and interpolation, would have grown,"
2401,FOOTNOTES:,"so as to embrace larger and larger portions of the poems, and at this"
2402,FOOTNOTES:,"day, instead of merely questioning this or that line in a few places,"
2403,FOOTNOTES:,"and comparing this with that reading, we should have been deliberating"
2404,FOOTNOTES:,"among a dozen Iliads and a dozen Odysseys, to discover which were the"
2405,FOOTNOTES:,true.
2406,FOOTNOTES:,
2407,FOOTNOTES:,"If, then, it be said that the proceedings of Pisistratus or of Solon,"
2408,FOOTNOTES:,bear testimony not to the soundness but to the incessant corruption
2409,FOOTNOTES:,"of the text, my answer is, they bear witness to its corruption, just"
2410,FOOTNOTES:,"as the records of the repairs of Westminster Abbey might be said,"
2411,FOOTNOTES:,"and truly said, to bear testimony to its disrepair. That partial and"
2412,FOOTNOTES:,"local faults, and dislocations, would creep in, is as certain as that"
2413,FOOTNOTES:,wind and weather act upon the stoutest fabric: but when we read of
2414,FOOTNOTES:,"the repairs of a building, we infer that pains were taken to make it"
2415,FOOTNOTES:,"habitable; and when we read of the restorations of Homer, we perceive"
2416,FOOTNOTES:,that it was an object of public solicitude to keep the poems in a
2417,FOOTNOTES:,"state of soundness. As, indeed, the building most used will _cæteris"
2418,FOOTNOTES:,"paribus_ require the most frequent repairs, so the elementary causes of"
2419,FOOTNOTES:,"corruption, by carelessness, might operate most powerfully in a case"
2420,FOOTNOTES:,where the poet might be recited by every strolling minstrel at a local
2421,FOOTNOTES:,festivity: but it is also clear that in these very cases there would
2422,FOOTNOTES:,be the greatest anxiety to detect and to eliminate the destructive
2423,FOOTNOTES:,"elements, when once they were seen to be making head. But, in truth,"
2424,FOOTNOTES:,the analogy of a building does not represent the case. Edifices are
2425,FOOTNOTES:,sometimes disfigured by the parsimony of after-times: but there was no
2426,FOOTNOTES:,"time, so far as we know, when Greece did not rate the value of Homer"
2427,FOOTNOTES:,"more highly than the cost of taking care of him. Again, the architects"
2428,FOOTNOTES:,"of degenerate ages think, as Bernini did of Michael Angelo, that they"
2429,FOOTNOTES:,can improve upon their designs: but the name of no Greek has been
2430,FOOTNOTES:,"recorded who thought he could improve upon Homer, and the vanity of the"
2431,FOOTNOTES:,nameless was likely to be checked by their companions and competitors.
2432,FOOTNOTES:,
2433,FOOTNOTES:,"We have principally had in view the question, whether Homer was, in a"
2434,FOOTNOTES:,"peculiar degree, guarded against any profound and radical corruption"
2435,FOOTNOTES:,which might grow out of unchecked carelessness; but the result will
2436,FOOTNOTES:,"be not more unfavourable, if we ask how did he stand in regard to"
2437,FOOTNOTES:,"the other great fountain-head of evil, namely, falsification with a"
2438,FOOTNOTES:,"purpose? Now, the fact, that in any given case provision is made for"
2439,FOOTNOTES:,"jealous custody against any attack from without, affords no proof, or"
2440,FOOTNOTES:,"even presumption, against the subsistence of destroying causes within."
2441,FOOTNOTES:,"But the Greeks, as a nation, had no motive to corrupt, and had every"
2442,FOOTNOTES:,motive to preserve the text of Homer. His national office and position
2443,FOOTNOTES:,"have been admirably expressed by Statius, in verses on the Trojan"
2444,FOOTNOTES:,expedition:--
2445,FOOTNOTES:,
2446,FOOTNOTES:,Tum primùm Græcia vires

2449,FOOTNOTES:,
2450,FOOTNOTES:,His works were the very cradle of the nation; there it first visibly
2451,FOOTNOTES:,lived and breathed. They were the most perfect expression of every
2452,FOOTNOTES:,Greek feeling and desire: in the rivalry between the Hellenic race and
2453,FOOTNOTES:,"the (afterwards so called) βάρβαροι of Asia, they gave, in forms the"
2454,FOOTNOTES:,"most effective and the most artful, everything worth having to the"
2455,FOOTNOTES:,"former, and left the later Greek nothing to add. What void to be filled"
2456,FOOTNOTES:,"could even vanity discover, when so many Greek chieftains, inferior,"
2457,FOOTNOTES:,"in a degree never measured, to Achilles, were, nevertheless, each of"
2458,FOOTNOTES:,"them, too strong for the prince of Trojan warriors?"
2459,FOOTNOTES:,
2460,FOOTNOTES:,"But it may perhaps be replied that, even supposing that collective"
2461,FOOTNOTES:,"Greece could gain nothing by corrupting Homer, yet the relative"
2462,FOOTNOTES:,distribution of honour among the principal States might be affected to
2463,FOOTNOTES:,"the profit of one and the prejudice of another. Now it is plain that,"
2464,FOOTNOTES:,"in this delicate and vital point, the sectional jealousies of the"
2465,FOOTNOTES:,Greeks would afford the best possible security to the general contents
2466,FOOTNOTES:,of the text: something of the same security that the hatred of the Jews
2467,FOOTNOTES:,"and the Samaritans supplied, when they became rival guardians of the"
2468,FOOTNOTES:,"books of the Old Testament. Argos, deeply interested for Diomed, and"
2469,FOOTNOTES:,"Lacedæmon for Menelaus, and both for Agamemnon, were watchmen alike"
2470,FOOTNOTES:,"powerful and keen against Athens, if she had attempted to obtain for"
2471,FOOTNOTES:,herself in the Iliad a place at all proportioned to her after-fame.
2472,FOOTNOTES:,"There were numerous parts of Homer’s Greece, both great and small,"

2475,FOOTNOTES:,"were fundamentally changed in the historic times. But all, whether"
2476,FOOTNOTES:,"they exulted in the longlived honours of their States, or whether"
2477,FOOTNOTES:,"they fondly brooded on the recollections of former fame, were alike"
2478,FOOTNOTES:,interested in resisting interlopers who might seek to trespass for
2479,FOOTNOTES:,"their own advantage, as well as in the general object of preserving"
2480,FOOTNOTES:,the priceless national monument from decay. Nor is there any room to
2481,FOOTNOTES:,"suppose, that these questions of primeval honour were indifferent to"
2482,FOOTNOTES:,the later Greeks. The citation from the Catalogue by the Athenian
2483,FOOTNOTES:,"envoys before Gelon in Herodotus (to take a single instance), affords"
2484,FOOTNOTES:,"conclusive proof to the contrary: and, even so late as in the day"
2485,FOOTNOTES:,"of Pausanias, he tells us that Argolis and Arcadia were the States,"
2486,FOOTNOTES:,which even then were still keenly disputing with Athens the palm of
2487,FOOTNOTES:,autochthonism.

2489,FOOTNOTES:,"It, therefore, appears to me that the presumptions of the case are on"
2490,FOOTNOTES:,"the whole favourable, and not adverse, to the general soundness of the"
2491,FOOTNOTES:,Homeric text.
2492,FOOTNOTES:,
2493,FOOTNOTES:,I confess myself to be very greatly confirmed in this view of the
2494,FOOTNOTES:,"presumptions, by the scarcely measurable amount of internal evidence"
2495,FOOTNOTES:,which the text supplies to substantiate its own integrity. Almost the
2496,FOOTNOTES:,whole of the copious materials which recent writers have accumulated to
2497,FOOTNOTES:,"prove the unity and personality of the author, is available to show the"
2498,FOOTNOTES:,soundness of the text. The appeal need not be only to the undisturbed
2499,FOOTNOTES:,"state of the main _strata_ of the poems, the consistent structure"
2500,FOOTNOTES:,and relations of the facts; the general _corpus_ of the poems might
2501,FOOTNOTES:,"have been sound, and yet a bad text would, when subjected to a very"
2502,FOOTNOTES:,"searching ordeal on the minutest points, have revealed a multitude of"
2503,FOOTNOTES:,"solecisms and errors: but, instead of this, the rigid application of"
2504,FOOTNOTES:,the microscope has only shown more clearly a great perfection in the
2505,FOOTNOTES:,workmanship. The innumerable forms of refined and delicate coincidence
2506,FOOTNOTES:,"in names and facts, in the use of epithets, the notes of character,"
2507,FOOTNOTES:,"the turn of speeches and phrases, and the like, are so many rills of"
2508,FOOTNOTES:,"evidence, which combine into a stream of resistless force, in favour of"
2509,FOOTNOTES:,"that text which has been found so admirably, as a mirror, to reflect"
2510,FOOTNOTES:,"the image and the mind of Homer, and which, like a mirror, could not"
2511,FOOTNOTES:,have reflected it truly unless it had itself been true.
2512,FOOTNOTES:,
2513,FOOTNOTES:,"Indeed, I must proceed a step further; and admit that the arguments"
2514,FOOTNOTES:,"_ab extra_, which I have here put forward respecting the historic aims"
2515,FOOTNOTES:,"of the poet, his proximity in time to his subject, and the probable"
2516,FOOTNOTES:,"soundness of the text, are rather answers to objections, than the"
2517,FOOTNOTES:,adequate materials of affirmative conviction.
2518,FOOTNOTES:,
2519,FOOTNOTES:,After having myself tested the text as to its self-consistency and
2520,FOOTNOTES:,"otherwise, in several thousand places, I find scarcely one or two"
2521,FOOTNOTES:,"places in each thousand, where it seems to invite expurgation in order"
2522,FOOTNOTES:,to establish the consistency of its contents. The evidence on which
2523,FOOTNOTES:,I really place reliance is experimental evidence: and that I find in
2524,FOOTNOTES:,"the poems, accumulated to a degree which no other human work within my"
2525,FOOTNOTES:,knowledge approaches. I do not presume to hope more than that the more
2526,FOOTNOTES:,"remote and general arguments, which have now been used, may assist in"
2527,FOOTNOTES:,removing preliminary barriers to the consideration of the one cardinal
2528,FOOTNOTES:,"and paramount argument, the text itself and its contents."
2529,FOOTNOTES:,
2530,FOOTNOTES:,And here a brief reference must be made to the scepticism in miniature
2531,FOOTNOTES:,which has replaced the more sweeping incredulity of Wolf and his
2532,FOOTNOTES:,"school. Editors of great weight, refusing to accompany even the"
2533,FOOTNOTES:,"Chorizontes in separating the authorship of the poems, nevertheless"
2534,FOOTNOTES:,freely condemn particular passages. I do not deny that there are
2535,FOOTNOTES:,"various passages, of which the genuineness is fair matter for"
2536,FOOTNOTES:,"discussion. But I confess that I find such grounds of excision, as"
2537,FOOTNOTES:,"those commonly alleged by critics recommending it, very indeterminate,"
2538,FOOTNOTES:,and of a nature to leave it doubtful where their operation is to stop.
2539,FOOTNOTES:,They generally involve arbitrary assumptions either of construction
2540,FOOTNOTES:,"or of history, or the application of a more rigid and literal rule"
2541,FOOTNOTES:,"of consistency than poetry either requires or can endure, or else"
2542,FOOTNOTES:,"the capital error, as I cannot but consider it, of bringing Homer"
2543,FOOTNOTES:,to be tried at the bar of later and inferior traditions. And there
2544,FOOTNOTES:,"is a want of common principles, a general insecurity of standing"
2545,FOOTNOTES:,"ground, and an appearance of reforming Homer not according to any"
2546,FOOTNOTES:,"acknowledged laws of criticism, but according to the humour of each"
2547,FOOTNOTES:,"accomplished and ingenious man: which, in a matter of this weight,"
2548,FOOTNOTES:,"is no sufficient guarantee. I therefore follow in the line of those,"
2549,FOOTNOTES:,whose recommendation is to draw every thing we can out of the present
2550,FOOTNOTES:,text; and to see how far its contents may constitute a substantive and
2551,FOOTNOTES:,"consistent whole, in the various branches of information to which they"
2552,FOOTNOTES:,"refer. When we have carried this process as far as it will bear, we may"
2553,FOOTNOTES:,"find, first that many or some of the seeming discordancies are really"
2554,FOOTNOTES:,"embraced within a comprehensive general harmony, and secondly that"
2555,FOOTNOTES:,with a fuller knowledge of the laws of that harmony we may ourselves
2556,FOOTNOTES:,be in a condition at least of less incapacity to pronounce what is
2557,FOOTNOTES:,Homeric and what is not. I will only say that were I to venture into
2558,FOOTNOTES:,"this field of criticism, I should be governed less than is usual by"
2559,FOOTNOTES:,discrepancies of fact often very hastily assumed; and much more than is
2560,FOOTNOTES:,usual by any violence done to the finer analogies of which Homer is so
2561,FOOTNOTES:,"full, and by departures from his regular modes of thought, feeling, and"

2675,[60] I. 57.,
2676,[60] I. 57.,
2677,[60] I. 57.,"The principal and final purpose, which I wish to present in the most"
2678,[60] I. 57.,"distinct manner to the mind of the reader, is that of securing for the"
2679,[60] I. 57.,"Homeric traditions, estimated according to the effect of the foregoing"
2680,[60] I. 57.,"considerations, a just measure of relative as well as absolute"
2681,[60] I. 57.,appreciation.
2682,[60] I. 57.,
2683,[60] I. 57.,It appears to me that there has prevailed in this respect a wide-spread
2684,[60] I. 57.,"and long-continued error, assuming various forms, and affecting in very"
2685,[60] I. 57.,"different degrees, without doubt, the practice of different writers,"
2686,[60] I. 57.,"but so extended and so rooted, as at this stage in the progress of"
2687,[60] I. 57.,"criticism to require formal challenge. I mean, that it is an error"
2688,[60] I. 57.,"to regard and accept all ancient traditions, relating to the periods"
2689,[60] I. 57.,"that precede regular historic annals, as of equal value, or not to"
2690,[60] I. 57.,"discriminate their several values with adequate care. Above all, I"
2691,[60] I. 57.,strongly contend that we should assign to the Homeric evidence a
2692,[60] I. 57.,"primary rank upon all the subjects which it touches, and that we should"
2693,[60] I. 57.,"make it a rule to reduce all other literary testimony, because of later"
2694,[60] I. 57.,"origin, to a subordinate and subsidiary position."
2695,[60] I. 57.,
2696,[60] I. 57.,"Mere rumours or stories of the pre-historic times are not, as such,"
2697,[60] I. 57.,"entitled to be called traditions. A story of this kind, say in"
2698,[60] I. 57.,"Apollodorus, may indeed by bare possibility be older than any thing in"
2699,[60] I. 57.,Homer; but if it comes to us without the proper and visible criteria
2700,[60] I. 57.,"of age, it has no claim upon our assent as a truthful record of the"
2701,[60] I. 57.,time to which it purports to refer. Traditions of this class only grow
2702,[60] I. 57.,"to be such, as a general rule, for us, at the time when they take a"
2703,[60] I. 57.,"positive form in the work of some author, who thus becomes, as far as"
2704,[60] I. 57.,"his time and circumstances permit, a witness to them. It is only from"
2705,[60] I. 57.,"thenceforward, that their faithful derivation and transmission can be"
2706,[60] I. 57.,relied on as in any degree probable.
2707,[60] I. 57.,
2708,[60] I. 57.,"Again, I cast aside statements with respect to which the poet, being"
2709,[60] I. 57.,"carried beyond the sphere of his ordinary experience, must, on that"
2710,[60] I. 57.,"account, not be presumed to speak historically; yet even here, if he is"
2711,[60] I. 57.,"speaking of matters which were in general belief, he is a witness of"
2712,[60] I. 57.,"the first class with respect to that belief, which is itself in another"
2713,[60] I. 57.,"sense a matter of history; and here also those, who have followed him"
2714,[60] I. 57.,"at a remote date, are witnesses of a lower order."
2715,[60] I. 57.,
2716,[60] I. 57.,"Or there may be cases, as, for instance, in the stubborn facts of"
2717,[60] I. 57.,"geography, where the laws of evidence compel us rudely to thrust aside"
2718,[60] I. 57.,the declaration of the bard; or cases where his mode of handling his
2719,[60] I. 57.,materials affords in itself a proof that he did not mean to speak
2720,[60] I. 57.,"historically, but, in the phrase of Aristotle, ἐκπληκτικῶς, or for"
2721,[60] I. 57.,poetic effect.
2722,[60] I. 57.,
2723,[60] I. 57.,"Or again, it is conceivable, though I do not know whether it has"
2724,[60] I. 57.,"happened, that Homeric testimony might come into conflict, not with"
2725,[60] I. 57.,"mere counter-assertion, but with those forms of circumstantial evidence"
2726,[60] I. 57.,which are sometimes conclusively elicited by reasoning from positive
2727,[60] I. 57.,"_data_ of architecture, language, and ethnology. I claim for Homer no"
2728,[60] I. 57.,exemption from the more cogent authority which may attach to reasoning
2729,[60] I. 57.,of this kind.
2730,[60] I. 57.,
2731,[60] I. 57.,"Clearing the question of these incumbrances, I wish to submit to"
2732,[60] I. 57.,"the suffrages of those, who may be more competent than myself to"
2733,[60] I. 57.,"estimate both the proposition and the proof, the following thesis:"
2734,[60] I. 57.,"that, in regard to the religion, history, ethnology, polity, and life"
2735,[60] I. 57.,"at large of the Greeks of the heroic times, the authority of the"
2736,[60] I. 57.,"Homeric poems, standing far above that of the whole mass of the later"
2737,[60] I. 57.,"literary traditions in any of their forms, ought never to be treated"
2738,[60] I. 57.,"as homogeneous with them, but should usually, in the first instance,"
2739,[60] I. 57.,"be handled by itself, and the testimony of later writers should, in"
2740,[60] I. 57.,"general, be handled in subordination to it, and should be tried by it,"
2741,[60] I. 57.,"as by a touchstone, on all the subjects which it embraces."
2742,[60] I. 57.,
2743,[60] I. 57.,It is generally admitted that Homer is older by some generations than
2744,[60] I. 57.,"Hesiod, by many than the authors of the Cyclical Poems; and older"
2745,[60] I. 57.,by many centuries than the general mass of our authorities on Greek
2746,[60] I. 57.,"antiquity, beginning with Æschylus and Herodotus, and coming down to"
2747,[60] I. 57.,"Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Ælian, Pausanias,"
2748,[60] I. 57.,"Diogenes Laertius. Nor is it by time alone, that his superior proximity"
2749,[60] I. 57.,and weight are to be measured. Of all the ages that have passed since
2750,[60] I. 57.,"Homer, it may be truly said that not one has produced a more acute,"
2751,[60] I. 57.,"accurate, and comprehensive observer. But, above all, writing of the"
2752,[60] I. 57.,"heroic time, he, and he alone, writes like one who, as from internal"
2753,[60] I. 57.,"evidence we may confidently assert, stood within its precinct, and was"
2754,[60] I. 57.,imbued from head to foot with its spirit and its associations.
2755,[60] I. 57.,
2756,[60] I. 57.,"It is, of course, quite possible, that in one particular or another,"
2757,[60] I. 57.,"Homer may be in error, and the later tradition, it is also just"
2758,[60] I. 57.,"possible, may be correct. But so, also, the evidence of an eye-witness"
2759,[60] I. 57.,"in a court of justice may be erroneous, while by chance the merest"
2760,[60] I. 57.,hearsay may be true. This does not divert men from a careful
2761,[60] I. 57.,"classification of evidence according to its presumptive value, where"
2762,[60] I. 57.,"they have purposes of utility, according to the common and limited"
2763,[60] I. 57.,"sense of the term, in their view. In regard to the early Greek history,"
2764,[60] I. 57.,"the practice has often been otherwise; partly in the works of scholars,"
2765,[60] I. 57.,"and yet more, as we might expect, in the more popular forms of tuition."
2766,[60] I. 57.,It has been to lump together the heterogeneous mass of traditions
2767,[60] I. 57.,embodied in the literature of a thousand years. All that the sport of
2768,[60] I. 57.,"fancy and imagination had conceived--all that national, or local, or"
2769,[60] I. 57.,personal vanity had suggested--all that motives of policy had forged in
2770,[60] I. 57.,history or religion--or so much of this aggregate as time has spared
2771,[60] I. 57.,"to us, has been treated without any systematic recognition of the"
2772,[60] I. 57.,different value of different orders of tradition. I admit that it is
2773,[60] I. 57.,towards the close of the Greek literature that we find the principal
2774,[60] I. 57.,professed inquirers into antiquity; and their aim and method may have
2775,[60] I. 57.,"redressed, in great part, any inequality between themselves and writers"
2776,[60] I. 57.,"of the time of Thucydides or Plato. But nothing can cancel, nothing, it"
2777,[60] I. 57.,"might almost be said, can narrow, the enormous interval, in point of"
2778,[60] I. 57.,"authority, between Homer, who sang in the heroic age, and those who not"
2779,[60] I. 57.,"only collected their materials, but formed their thoughts, after it was"
2780,[60] I. 57.,"closed, and after its floating reminiscences had become subject to the"
2781,[60] I. 57.,incessant action of falsifying processes.
2782,[60] I. 57.,
2783,[60] I. 57.,For a length of time the temper of our ancient histories was one of
2784,[60] I. 57.,"unquestioning reception. But where much was self-contradictory, all"
2785,[60] I. 57.,"could not be believed. Under these circumstances, it was not unnatural"
2786,[60] I. 57.,"that those writers who were full and systematic, should be preferred,"
2787,[60] I. 57.,rather than that the labour should be undergone of gathering gold in
2788,[60] I. 57.,"grains from the pages of Homer, of carefully collecting facts and"
2789,[60] I. 57.,"presumptions singly from the text, and then again estimating the amount"
2790,[60] I. 57.,and effect of their bearings upon one another. Hence the Catalogues
2791,[60] I. 57.,"of Apollodorus, or the downright assertions of Scholiasts, have"
2792,[60] I. 57.,been allowed to give form to our early histories of Greece; and the
2793,[60] I. 57.,"authentic, but usually slighter notices of Homer, have received little"
2794,[60] I. 57.,"attention, except where, in some detail or other, they might suit"
2795,[60] I. 57.,the argument which each particular writer happened to have in hand.
2796,[60] I. 57.,"Again, because Herodotus was by profession an historian and nothing"
2797,[60] I. 57.,"else (at least, I can discern no better reason), more importance"
2798,[60] I. 57.,seems to be attached to his notices of prior ages than to the less
2799,[60] I. 57.,"formally presented notices of Homer, who, according to the statement of"
2800,[60] I. 57.,"Herodotus himself, preceded him by four hundred years. I do not mean"
2801,[60] I. 57.,by this remark to imply that Herodotus and Homer are particularly at
2802,[60] I. 57.,"variance with one another, but only to illustrate what seems to me a"
2803,[60] I. 57.,prevailing source of error.
2804,[60] I. 57.,
2805,[60] I. 57.,"In general, where the traditions reported by the later writers are"
2806,[60] I. 57.,"preferred to those of Homer, it is perhaps because, although they may"
2807,[60] I. 57.,conflict with probability as well as with one another in an infinity
2808,[60] I. 57.,"of points, yet they are in themselves more systematic and complete."
2809,[60] I. 57.,They represent to us for the most part _pasticcios_ arbitrarily made up
2810,[60] I. 57.,"of materials of unequal value, but yet made up into wholes; whereas,"
2811,[60] I. 57.,the evidence which he supplies is original though it is fragmentary.
2812,[60] I. 57.,"Had he been followed by a continuous succession of authors, we should,"
2813,[60] I. 57.,"no doubt, do wisely in consenting to view the subjects of fact, with"
2814,[60] I. 57.,"which he dealt, mainly as they were viewed by those who trod in his"
2815,[60] I. 57.,"steps. But, on the contrary, they were separated from him by a gulf"
2816,[60] I. 57.,"both wide and deep; over which his compositions floated, in despite"
2817,[60] I. 57.,of difficulties so great that many have deemed them positively
2818,[60] I. 57.,"insurmountable, only by their extraordinary buoyancy."
2819,[60] I. 57.,
2820,[60] I. 57.,It is in the Cyclic poems that we should naturally seek for materials
2821,[60] I. 57.,"to enlarge, expound, or correct Homer. But there is not a line or a"
2822,[60] I. 57.,"notice remaining of any one of them, which would justify our assigning"
2823,[60] I. 57.,to them any historical authority sufficient to qualify them for such a
2824,[60] I. 57.,"purpose. Their reputed authors, from Arctinus downwards, all belong to"
2825,[60] I. 57.,periods within the dates of the Olympiads[93]. They all bear marks of
2826,[60] I. 57.,"having been written to fill the gaps which Homer had left unoccupied,"
2827,[60] I. 57.,"and so to enter into a partnership, if not with his fame, yet with his"
2828,[60] I. 57.,"popularity; with the popularity, of which his works, as we can well"
2829,[60] I. 57.,"judge from more recent experience, would be sure to shed some portion"
2830,[60] I. 57.,"upon all compositions ostensibly allied with them, and which then, as"
2831,[60] I. 57.,"now, presented the most cogent inducements to imitators who had their"
2832,[60] I. 57.,livelihood to seek by means of their Muse.
2833,[60] I. 57.,
2834,[60] I. 57.,"Homer, without doubt, gave an immense addition of celebrity and vogue"
2835,[60] I. 57.,"to the subject of the Trojan war, much as Boiardo and Ariosto did to"
2836,[60] I. 57.,the whole circle of the romances of which Orlando is the centre. One
2837,[60] I. 57.,"of these poems, the Ἰλίου Πέρσις, is a simple expansion, as Mure has"
2838,[60] I. 57.,"observed[94], of the third lay of Demodocus in the Eighth Odyssey[95]."
2839,[60] I. 57.,"They seem to bear the mark of being, not composed first-hand from"
2840,[60] I. 57.,"actions of men, but from a stock of compositions in which heroic"
2841,[60] I. 57.,actions had already been enshrined; so little do they appear to have
2842,[60] I. 57.,been stamped with the individuality which denotes original design. And
2843,[60] I. 57.,accordingly the usual manner of quoting them is not as the certain
2844,[60] I. 57.,"works of a given person, but the form of citation is (ὁ γράψας τὴν"
2845,[60] I. 57.,"μικρὰν Ἰλιάδα, ὁ ποιήσας τὰ Κύπρια ἔπη), the writer of the little"
2846,[60] I. 57.,"Iliad, the composer of the Cyprian Songs, and the like. Heyne[96] holds"
2847,[60] I. 57.,even the commencement of the Cyclic poems to have been at least a
2848,[60] I. 57.,century after the date of the Iliad and Odyssey.
2849,[60] I. 57.,
2850,[60] I. 57.,"Mr. Fynes Clinton, whose name can never be mentioned without a grateful"
2851,[60] I. 57.,"recognition of his merits and services, supplies, in the early part"
2852,[60] I. 57.,"of his Fasti Hellenici, many valuable suggestions for the sifting of"
2853,[60] I. 57.,"early Greek history. But he nowhere acknowledges, or approaches (I"
2854,[60] I. 57.,"believe) to the acknowledgment of the rule, that for the heroic age"
2855,[60] I. 57.,the authority of Homer stands alone in kind. In the Fasti Hellenici
2856,[60] I. 57.,"many statements, dating long after Homer, are delivered as if of"
2857,[60] I. 57.,equal authority with his in regard to the history of that age; and
2858,[60] I. 57.,"Mr. Clinton seems to have been led into a snare, to which his duty"
2859,[60] I. 57.,"as a chronologer probably exposed him, in assuming that history"
2860,[60] I. 57.,"and chronology may be expected to begin together; an assumption, I"
2861,[60] I. 57.,"apprehend, not supported by probability. Mr. Mitford has admirably"
2862,[60] I. 57.,"pointed out the importance of veracity to Homer’s function, and to his"
2863,[60] I. 57.,"fame as a poet, at a time when a poet could be the only historian[97],"
2864,[60] I. 57.,"the probability and singular consistency of his scattered anecdotes,"
2865,[60] I. 57.,"and the remarkable contrast between the clearness of his history, and"
2866,[60] I. 57.,"the darkness and uncertainty which follow after him, and continue until"
2867,[60] I. 57.,the historic age begins; nor does he scruple to declare that ‘for these
2868,[60] I. 57.,early ages Homer is our best guide[98].’ But even this is still short
2869,[60] I. 57.,"of my desire, which is not merely to recognise him as _primus inter"
2870,[60] I. 57.,"pares_, but to treat his testimony as paramount, and as constituting a"
2871,[60] I. 57.,"class by itself, with which no other literary testimony can compete."
2872,[60] I. 57.,"And so once more Bishop Marsh, in his able work on the Pelasgi, assigns"
2873,[60] I. 57.,"no special office, I might perhaps say no peculiar weight, to the"
2874,[60] I. 57.,Homeric testimony.
2875,[60] I. 57.,
2876,[60] I. 57.,But I am glad to shelter myself under the authority afforded me by the
2877,[60] I. 57.,"practice of Buttmann, who, in the Preface to his admirable Lexilogus,"
2878,[60] I. 57.,declares his rule of philological investigation in Homer to be this:
2879,[60] I. 57.,"to take, first, the evidence of the text itself in its several parts;"
2880,[60] I. 57.,"secondly, that of the succeeding epic poetry, and along with this"
2881,[60] I. 57.,"the testimony of the prime after-ages of Greek literature; thirdly,"
2882,[60] I. 57.,grammatical tradition.
2883,[60] I. 57.,
2884,[60] I. 57.,And yet the extensive contrariety between the old and the new is
2885,[60] I. 57.,"admitted. ‘The Iliad and the Odyssey,’ says Mr. Grote[99], ‘and the"
2886,[60] I. 57.,"remaining Hesiodic fragments, exhibit but too frequently a hopeless"
2887,[60] I. 57.,"diversity, when confronted with the narratives of the logographers.’"
2888,[60] I. 57.,And the author of the Minos[100] cleared away the fabulous and defaming
2889,[60] I. 57.,"accounts of that sovereign, to return to the representations of Homer"
2890,[60] I. 57.,"and of Hesiod; καίτοι γε πιθανώτεροί εἰσιν ἢ σύμπαντες οἱ τραῳδοποιοὶ,"
2891,[60] I. 57.,"ὧν συ ἀκούων ταῦτα λέγεις. The great ancient writers, indeed, seem"
2892,[60] I. 57.,never to have questioned the authority of Homer as a witness; nor
2893,[60] I. 57.,could any one wish to see him enthroned at a greater elevation than
2894,[60] I. 57.,that assigned to him as late as in the pages of Strabo. Virgil
2895,[60] I. 57.,"systematically made light of him, but he was in a manner compelled by"
2896,[60] I. 57.,his subject to make light of historical veracity altogether.
2897,[60] I. 57.,
2898,[60] I. 57.,"Historical scepticism, which has come of late years into possession of"
2899,[60] I. 57.,"the ground, has not redressed, as affecting Homer, the wrong that had"
2900,[60] I. 57.,been done by historical credulity. We once exalted into history the
2901,[60] I. 57.,general mass of traditions relating to the ages which next preceded
2902,[60] I. 57.,those of continuous historic records; we now again decline the labour
2903,[60] I. 57.,"of discrimination, and reduce them all alike into legend. The name of"
2904,[60] I. 57.,Mr. Grote must carry great weight in any question of Greek research:
2905,[60] I. 57.,but it may be doubted whether the force and aptitude of his powerful
2906,[60] I. 57.,mind have been as successfully applied to the Homeric as to the later
2907,[60] I. 57.,"periods. He presents us, indeed, with even more goodly and copious"
2908,[60] I. 57.,"catalogues than historians are wont of Æolids, of Pelopids, of ruling"
2909,[60] I. 57.,"families in every corner of Greece, and from the earliest times; but"
2910,[60] I. 57.,"he, too, fixes a chronological point for the commencement of history,"
2911,[60] I. 57.,"namely, the first recorded Olympiad[101]. He seems to think that the"
2912,[60] I. 57.,trustworthy chronology of Greece begins before its real history. He
2913,[60] I. 57.,declines to take his start from disinterred Pelasgi[102]; he conceives
2914,[60] I. 57.,that we have no other authority for the existence of Troy than we have
2915,[60] I. 57.,for the theogonic revolutions[103]; the immense array of early names
2916,[60] I. 57.,that he presents are offered as names purely legendary. He will not
2917,[60] I. 57.,attempt to determine how much or how little of history these legends
2918,[60] I. 57.,"may contain; he will not exhibit a picture from behind the curtain,"
2919,[60] I. 57.,"because, as he forcibly says, the curtain is the picture, and cannot by"
2920,[60] I. 57.,"any ingenuity be withdrawn[104]. He deals in the main alike with Homer,"
2921,[60] I. 57.,"Hesiod, the tragedians and minor Greek poets, the scattered notices"
2922,[60] I. 57.,"of the historians, of the antiquarian writers near the Christian era,"
2923,[60] I. 57.,"and of the Scholiasts. Of course, therefore, he cannot be expected"
2924,[60] I. 57.,"to rectify the fault, if such there has been, in regard to the"
2925,[60] I. 57.,appreciation of the poems of Homer.
2926,[60] I. 57.,
2927,[60] I. 57.,"I may, however, observe that in this, as in other cases, extremes"
2928,[60] I. 57.,"appear to meet. Attempts to winnow the legendary lore, and to separate"
2929,[60] I. 57.,"the historic or primitive kernel from the husk, were clearing the"
2930,[60] I. 57.,stage of a multitude of mythical personages unknown to the earliest
2931,[60] I. 57.,"tradition; all of whom now are ushered in once more; they are, indeed,"
2932,[60] I. 57.,labelled as unhistorical; but they are again mixed up wholesale with
2933,[60] I. 57.,"those, from whose company critical observation had expelled them. In"
2934,[60] I. 57.,thus reimparting a promiscuous character to the first scenes of Grecian
2935,[60] I. 57.,"history, we seem to effect a retrogressive and not a progressive"
2936,[60] I. 57.,operation. At any rate it should be understood that the issue raised
2937,[60] I. 57.,"embraces the question, whether the personality of Achilles and"
2938,[60] I. 57.,"Agamemnon has no better root in history than that of Pelasgus, of"
2939,[60] I. 57.,"Prometheus, or of Hellen. And again, whether all these, being equal"
2940,[60] I. 57.,"to one another, are likewise equal, and no more than equal, in credit"
2941,[60] I. 57.,"to Ceres, Bacchus, or Apollo. As to all alike, what proportion of"
2942,[60] I. 57.,"truth there may be in the legend, or whether any, ‘it is impossible"
2943,[60] I. 57.,"to ascertain, and useless to inquire[105];’ all alike belong to a"
2944,[60] I. 57.,"region, essentially mythical, neither approachable by the critic, nor"
2945,[60] I. 57.,measurable by the chronologer.
2946,[60] I. 57.,
2947,[60] I. 57.,If the opinions which have been here expressed are in any degree
2948,[60] I. 57.,"correct, we must endeavour to recover as substantial personages, and"
2949,[60] I. 57.,"to bring within the grasp of flesh and blood some of those pictures,"
2950,[60] I. 57.,"and even of those persons, whom Mr. Grote has dismissed to the land of"
2951,[60] I. 57.,Shadow and of Dream.
2952,[60] I. 57.,
2953,[60] I. 57.,"In this view, the earliest Greek history should be founded on the text"
2954,[60] I. 57.,"of Homer, and not merely on its surface, but on its depths. Not only"
2955,[60] I. 57.,"its more broad and obvious statements should be registered, but we"
2956,[60] I. 57.,"should search and ransack all those slighter indications, suggestions,"
2957,[60] I. 57.,"and sources of inference, in which it is so extraordinarily rich;"
2958,[60] I. 57.,"and compel it, as it were, to yield up its treasures. We cannot,"
2959,[60] I. 57.,"indeed, like the zoologist, say the very words, Give me the bone, and"
2960,[60] I. 57.,I will disinter the animal; yet so accurately was the mind of Homer
2961,[60] I. 57.,"constructed, that we may come nearer to this certainty in dealing"
2962,[60] I. 57.,"with him, than with any other child of man. The later and inferior"
2963,[60] I. 57.,"evidence should be differently handled, and should not be viewed as"
2964,[60] I. 57.,"intrinsically authoritative. But that portion of it, which fills up the"
2965,[60] I. 57.,"gaps or confirms the suggestions of Homer, becomes thereby entitled"
2966,[60] I. 57.,"to something of historic rank. Again, widely extended and uniformly"
2967,[60] I. 57.,"continued traditions may amount to proof of notoriety, and may, not"
2968,[60] I. 57.,"by their individual credit, but by their concurrence, supply us with"
2969,[60] I. 57.,"standing ground of tolerable firmness. Beyond all this we may proceed,"
2970,[60] I. 57.,"and may present to view, where for any cause it seems desirable, even"
2971,[60] I. 57.,"ill-supported legends, but always as such, with fair notice of any"
2972,[60] I. 57.,"circumstances which may tend to fix their credit or discredit, and"
2973,[60] I. 57.,with a line sufficiently marked between these and the recitals which
2974,[60] I. 57.,"rest upon Homeric authority. Thus, the general rule would be to begin"
2975,[60] I. 57.,with Homer: _a Jove principium_. We should plant his statements each
2976,[60] I. 57.,"in their place, as so many foundation stones. While he leads us by the"
2977,[60] I. 57.,"hand, we should tread with comparative confidence; when we quit his"
2978,[60] I. 57.,"guidance, we should proceed with caution, with mistrust, with a tone no"
2979,[60] I. 57.,higher than that of speculation and avowed conjecture.
2980,[60] I. 57.,
2981,[60] I. 57.,"In many instances, the application of these principles will require"
2982,[60] I. 57.,the rudiments of early Greek history to be recast. In illustration of
2983,[60] I. 57.,"this statement, I will refer to a legend, which has heretofore been"
2984,[60] I. 57.,popularly assumed as in a great degree the ethnological starting point
2985,[60] I. 57.,of Greek history.
2986,[60] I. 57.,
2987,[60] I. 57.,The current ideas respecting the distribution of the Greek races are
2988,[60] I. 57.,"founded upon the supposition that there was a certain Hellen, and that"
2989,[60] I. 57.,"he had three sons, Dorus, Æolus, and Xuthus, the last of whom died and"
2990,[60] I. 57.,"left behind him two sons, Ion and Achæus. This Hellen was (so runs the"
2991,[60] I. 57.,"story) the son of Deucalion, and Deucalion was the son of Prometheus,"
2992,[60] I. 57.,"and the husband of Pyrrha, who again was the daughter of Epimetheus"
2993,[60] I. 57.,"and of Pandora, the first-made woman. From the agency of Deucalion and"
2994,[60] I. 57.,"Pyrrha, the human race took a new commencement after the Deluge. The"
2995,[60] I. 57.,"nation at large were called Hellenes, after Hellen; and from his two"
2996,[60] I. 57.,"surviving sons, and his grandsons Ion and Achæus, were named the four"
2997,[60] I. 57.,great branches of the common stem. Such is the legend as it stands in
2998,[60] I. 57.,Apollodorus[106]; and that part of it which describes Hellen and his
2999,[60] I. 57.,"three sons, but no more, is found in a fragment of Hesiod, quoted by"
3000,[60] I. 57.,Tzetzes on Lycophron[107].
3001,[60] I. 57.,
3002,[60] I. 57.,"It is obvious that any one, setting about the invention of a story with"
3003,[60] I. 57.,"the compound purpose, first, of uniting the Greeks in a common bond of"
3004,[60] I. 57.,"race; secondly, of referring them to a common country as their cradle;"
3005,[60] I. 57.,"and, thirdly, of carrying up their origin to an extreme antiquity,"
3006,[60] I. 57.,"could hardly have done better than invent this tale. And that, which"
3007,[60] I. 57.,"might have been done at a stroke by an individual mind, was done no"
3008,[60] I. 57.,less effectually by the common thought and wish of the Greek people
3009,[60] I. 57.,moulding itself by degrees into tradition. The tale has a symmetry
3010,[60] I. 57.,"about it, most suggestive of design and invention. How clearly it"
3011,[60] I. 57.,connects all the celebrated families or groups of the Greek nation;
3012,[60] I. 57.,with what accuracy it fixes their relation to the common stem; and with
3013,[60] I. 57.,how much impartial consideration for the self-love of every one among
3014,[60] I. 57.,"them, and for their several shares of fame."
3015,[60] I. 57.,
3016,[60] I. 57.,"Not only in general, but even in detail, we may watch the gradual"
3017,[60] I. 57.,formation of this tradition adapting itself to the state of Greece.
3018,[60] I. 57.,"In Homer we find no Hellenes greatly distinguished, except Æolids"
3019,[60] I. 57.,and Achæans. This is the first stage. But when the Dorians attain
3020,[60] I. 57.,"to power[108], they claim a share in the past answerable to their"
3021,[60] I. 57.,predominance in the present: and they receive accordingly the first
3022,[60] I. 57.,"place in the genealogy as it stands in Hesiod, where Dorus is the"
3023,[60] I. 57.,"first-named among the three sons of Hellen. The Achæans, now in"
3024,[60] I. 57.,"depression, do not appear as Hellenes at all. But with the lapse of"
3025,[60] I. 57.,"time the Ionians of Athens, becoming powerful, desire to be also"
3026,[60] I. 57.,famous: therefore room must be made for them: and the Achæans too
3027,[60] I. 57.,"by their local intermixture with the same race, and their political"
3028,[60] I. 57.,"sympathy with Athens, once more come to be entitled to notice: Xuthus"
3029,[60] I. 57.,"accordingly, in the final form of the tradition is provided with two"
3030,[60] I. 57.,"sons. Ion and Achæus, and now all the four branches have each their"
3031,[60] I. 57.,respective place.
3032,[60] I. 57.,
3033,[60] I. 57.,"This tradition, however, is neither in whole nor in part sustained by"
3034,[60] I. 57.,"Homer, and can by no effort be made to fit into Homer; to say nothing"
3035,[60] I. 57.,"of its containing within itself much incongruity. If we exclude Xuthus,"
3036,[60] I. 57.,"as a mere mute, it gives us five persons as the eponymists of five"
3037,[60] I. 57.,"races, the four last included in the first. But of the five persons"
3038,[60] I. 57.,"thus placed upon the stage, Homer gives us but one; that one, Æolus,"
3039,[60] I. 57.,"has no race or tribe, but only two or three lines of descendants"
3040,[60] I. 57.,"named after him. Again, the two or three children of Æolus in Homer"
3041,[60] I. 57.,"become five in Hesiod, twelve in Apollodorus, and by additions from"
3042,[60] I. 57.,other writers reach a respectable total of seventeen[109]. Thus as
3043,[60] I. 57.,"to persons, Homer has indeed an Æolus, but he has no Hellen, no"
3044,[60] I. 57.,"Dorus, no Ion, no Achæus. Now as to races. He mentions, without doubt,"
3045,[60] I. 57.,"Hellenes, Achæans, Dorians, Ionians; but affords hardly any means of"
3046,[60] I. 57.,"identifying Dorians with Hellenes, and as to Ionians, supplies pretty"
3047,[60] I. 57.,strong presumptions that they were not Hellenic[110]. Nor does he
3048,[60] I. 57.,establish any relation whatever between any of the four races and any
3049,[60] I. 57.,"common ancestor or eponymist. Again, the Deucalion of this legend is"
3050,[60] I. 57.,"two generations before its Æolus; but the Deucalion of Homer, who may"
3051,[60] I. 57.,"be reckoned as three generations before the fall of Troy, is also three"
3052,[60] I. 57.,"generations later than his Æolus. In fact, this legend of Hellen and"
3053,[60] I. 57.,"his family is like an ugly and flimsy, but formal, modern house, built"
3054,[60] I. 57.,by the sacrilegious collection of the fragments of a noble ruin.
3055,[60] I. 57.,
3056,[60] I. 57.,"It may be thought dangerous, however, in setting up the authority"
3057,[60] I. 57.,"of Homer, to pull down that of Hesiod, who comes nearest to him."
3058,[60] I. 57.,"But, firstly, Hesiod is only responsible for so much of the legend"
3059,[60] I. 57.,as connects two persons named Æolus and Dorus with Hellen as their
3060,[60] I. 57.,source; which is at any rate no more than a poetical dress given to an
3061,[60] I. 57.,hypothesis substantially not in conflict with the Homeric traditions.
3062,[60] I. 57.,"Secondly, as respects literal truth, the name Hellen at once bears"
3063,[60] I. 57.,the strongest evidence against its own pretensions to an historical
3064,[60] I. 57.,"character such as that assigned to it, because its etymology refers it"
3065,[60] I. 57.,"to the territorial name Ἑλλὰς, and through this to the national name"
3066,[60] I. 57.,"Ἕλλοι[111]. Lastly, the essential difference in point of authority lies"
3067,[60] I. 57.,"between Homer and Hesiod, not between Homer together with Hesiod on"
3068,[60] I. 57.,"the one side, and those who came after Hesiod on the other. Homer was"
3069,[60] I. 57.,fully within the sphere and spirit of the heroic age; Hesiod was as
3070,[60] I. 57.,plainly outside it. He is apparently separated from the mighty master
3071,[60] I. 57.,"by a considerable term, even as measured in years. That term it would"
3072,[60] I. 57.,be difficult to define by any given number; but it is easy to see that
3073,[60] I. 57.,even when defined it would convey an utterly inadequate idea of the
3074,[60] I. 57.,"interval of poetic and personal difference, and of moral and social"
3075,[60] I. 57.,"change, between Hesiod and Homer. It is not to be found in this or that"
3076,[60] I. 57.,"variation, for it belongs to the whole order of ideas; all the elements"
3077,[60] I. 57.,"of thought, the whole tone of the picture, the atmosphere in which"
3078,[60] I. 57.,"persons and objects are seen, are essentially modified."
3079,[60] I. 57.,
3080,[60] I. 57.,"I venture one remark, however, upon Hesiod’s very beautiful account of"
3081,[60] I. 57.,the Ages. None can fail to be struck by the order in which he places
3082,[60] I. 57.,"them. Beginning with the Golden, he comes next to the Silver age, and"
3083,[60] I. 57.,"then to Brass. But, instead of descending forthwith the fourth and last"
3084,[60] I. 57.,"step to the Iron age, he very singularly retraces his steps, and breaks"
3085,[60] I. 57.,"the downward chain by an age of heroes, of whom he says that it was"
3086,[60] I. 57.,
3087,[60] I. 57.,"δικαιότερον καὶ ἄρειον,"
3088,[60] I. 57.,"ἀνδρῶν ἡρώων θεῖον γένος, οἱ καλέονται"
3089,[60] I. 57.,ἡμίθεοι προτέρῃ γενεᾷ κατ’ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν[112].
3090,[60] I. 57.,
3091,[60] I. 57.,"These, he goes on to explain, were the men, partly slain in the Theban"
3092,[60] I. 57.,"and Trojan wars, partly translated by Jupiter to the ends of the earth,"
3093,[60] I. 57.,"the islands of the blest. After this, the scale drops, at once, to the"
3094,[60] I. 57.,"lowest point, the Iron age, the age without either Νέμεσις or Αἰδὼς,"
3095,[60] I. 57.,the age of sheer wickedness and corruption.
3096,[60] I. 57.,
3097,[60] I. 57.,"This very curious turn in the arrangement of the Hesiodic Ages, and"
3098,[60] I. 57.,"especially the insertion, in a regular figurative series taken from the"
3099,[60] I. 57.,"metals, of a completely heterogeneous passage, calls for explanation;"
3100,[60] I. 57.,and I venture to suggest that this passage should be construed as
3101,[60] I. 57.,"disclosing to us that brilliant halo, which the Homeric poems had cast"
3102,[60] I. 57.,"over an age still recent, so as not only to hold it above the one that"
3103,[60] I. 57.,"followed, but also to raise it even above that which had preceded it;"
3104,[60] I. 57.,"above the age of Bellerophon, of Tantalus, of Sisyphus, of Minos, and"
3105,[60] I. 57.,even of Hercules. The splendour of the fame of heroes really depended
3106,[60] I. 57.,on the Bard. The great Bard of Greece had lifted Achilles and Ulysses
3107,[60] I. 57.,"to a height surpassing that of the older Heroes, who remained unsung"
3108,[60] I. 57.,"by him; and he had promised Menelaus, in the Fourth Odyssey[113],"
3109,[60] I. 57.,"that very seat in the regions of the blest, to which allusion is here"
3110,[60] I. 57.,made by Hesiod. While the apparent poetic solecism of this passage is
3111,[60] I. 57.,"thus accounted for, it becomes, at once, both an emphatic testimony"
3112,[60] I. 57.,"to the immense power exercised by the verse of Homer, and a distinct"
3113,[60] I. 57.,"declaration by Hesiod of the wide social interval, by which he was"
3114,[60] I. 57.,himself separated from the heroic period; a declaration entirely
3115,[60] I. 57.,"accordant with the internal evidence of the poems of Hesiod generally,"
3116,[60] I. 57.,"and amounting by implication to the double statement from this poet,"
3117,[60] I. 57.,"that Homer belonged to the heroic age, and that he himself did not"
3118,[60] I. 57.,belong to it.
3119,[60] I. 57.,
3120,[60] I. 57.,"The tradition of Hellen and his sons, then, exhibits one of the cases"
3121,[60] I. 57.,"in which we must take our choice between the testimony of Homer, and"
3122,[60] I. 57.,what are apparently the inventions of the later Greeks.
3123,[60] I. 57.,
3124,[60] I. 57.,"Another of these cases, which will be my second and last illustration,"
3125,[60] I. 57.,relates to Helen of Troy.
3126,[60] I. 57.,
3127,[60] I. 57.,It has been much disputed whether this celebrated character is to be
3128,[60] I. 57.,regarded as historical or fictitious. A writer of no less judgment
3129,[60] I. 57.,"and authority than the Bishop of St. David’s, adopts the latter"
3130,[60] I. 57.,"alternative, upon various grounds. The strongest among them all, in"
3131,[60] I. 57.,"his view, is, that ‘in the abduction of Helen, Paris only repeats an"
3132,[60] I. 57.,"exploit, also attributed to Theseus[114].’ This exploit, the Bishop"
3133,[60] I. 57.,"thinks, was known to Homer, as he introduces Æthra, the mother of"
3134,[60] I. 57.,"Theseus, in the company of Helen at Troy. And other writers have"
3135,[60] I. 57.,"further developed these ideas, by finding absurdity in the Homeric tale"
3136,[60] I. 57.,"of Helen, on the ground that she must have been eighty years old when"
3137,[60] I. 57.,the supposed abduction by Paris took place.
3138,[60] I. 57.,
3139,[60] I. 57.,"Now, the basis of these statements entirely depends upon the assumption"
3140,[60] I. 57.,that the later traditions are entitled to be treated either as upon
3141,[60] I. 57.,"a par, or, at any rate, as homogeneous with those of Homer. The"
3142,[60] I. 57.,"tradition which assigns a rape of Helen to Theseus, is only available"
3143,[60] I. 57.,"to discredit the tale of Homer, on the supposition that it rests upon"
3144,[60] I. 57.,"authority like that of Homer. But if it was a late invention, then it"
3145,[60] I. 57.,is more probably to be regarded as a witness to the fame of the Homeric
3146,[60] I. 57.,"personages, and the anxiety of Attica to give her hero the advantage"
3147,[60] I. 57.,"of similar embellishments, than as an original tradition which Homer"
3148,[60] I. 57.,"copied, or as a twin report with that which he has handed down."
3149,[60] I. 57.,
3150,[60] I. 57.,The tradition of the rape of Helen by Theseus is mentioned by
3151,[60] I. 57.,Herodotus[115] as a tale current among the Athenians. He testifies
3152,[60] I. 57.,"apparently to the fact, that the Deceleans of Attica enjoyed certain"
3153,[60] I. 57.,"immunities in Sparta, and were spared by the Lacedæmonian forces when"
3154,[60] I. 57.,they invaded Attica; which was ascribed by the Athenians to their
3155,[60] I. 57.,"having assisted in the recovery of Helen from Theseus, by pointing out"
3156,[60] I. 57.,"to the Tyndaridæ the place of her concealment. Herodotus, however,"
3157,[60] I. 57.,"does not affirm the cause stated by the Athenians, nor the abduction"
3158,[60] I. 57.,"by Theseus, which afterwards became, or had even then become, an"
3159,[60] I. 57.,"established tradition. Isocrates[116] handles it without misgiving, and"
3160,[60] I. 57.,"it is methodized in Plutarch, with a multitude of other particulars,"
3161,[60] I. 57.,our acceptance of which absolutely requires the rejection of Homer’s
3162,[60] I. 57.,historical authority.
3163,[60] I. 57.,
3164,[60] I. 57.,"And so again with regard to Æthra, the daughter of Pittheus, whom the"
3165,[60] I. 57.,later ages have connected with Theseus. We have no right to treat her
3166,[60] I. 57.,"introduction in the company of Helen[117], as a proof that Homer knew"
3167,[60] I. 57.,"of a story connecting Helen with Theseus, unless we knew, which we do"
3168,[60] I. 57.,"not, from Homer, or from authority entitled to compete with Homer, that"
3169,[60] I. 57.,there was a relation between Æthra and Theseus.
3170,[60] I. 57.,
3171,[60] I. 57.,"Now, the story of Homer respecting Helen, is perfectly self-consistent:"
3172,[60] I. 57.,and so is his story respecting Theseus: but the two are separated by
3173,[60] I. 57.,"an interval of little less than two generations, or say fifty years."
3174,[60] I. 57.,"For Theseus[118] fought in the wars against the Φῆρες, in which Nestor"
3175,[60] I. 57.,"took part: and he wooed and wedded Ariadne, the aunt of Idomeneus, who"
3176,[60] I. 57.,was himself nearly or quite one generation older than the Greek kings
3177,[60] I. 57.,"in general. On the other hand, Homer shows the age of Helen to have"
3178,[60] I. 57.,"been in just proportion to that of Menelaus: for she had a daughter,"
3179,[60] I. 57.,"Hermione, before the abduction, and might, so far as age was concerned,"
3180,[60] I. 57.,have borne children after their conjugal union was resumed[119].
3181,[60] I. 57.,"Why, then, if Homer be the paramount authority, should we, upon"
3182,[60] I. 57.,"testimony inferior to his, introduce conflict and absurdity into two"
3183,[60] I. 57.,"traditions, which he gives us wide apart from one another and each"
3184,[60] I. 57.,"self-consistent, by forging a connexion between them?"
3185,[60] I. 57.,
3186,[60] I. 57.,"I have stated these two cases, not by way of begging the question as to"
3187,[60] I. 57.,"the superiority in kind of Homer’s testimony, but to show how important"
3188,[60] I. 57.,that question is; and in how many instances the history of the heroic
3189,[60] I. 57.,"age must be rewritten, if we adopt the principle, that Homer ought to"
3190,[60] I. 57.,"be received as an original witness, contemporary with the manners, nay,"
3191,[60] I. 57.,"perhaps, even with some of the persons he describes, and subject only"
3192,[60] I. 57.,to such deductions as other original witnesses are liable to suffer:
3193,[60] I. 57.,"whereas the later traditions rest only upon hearsay; so much so, that"
3194,[60] I. 57.,"they can hardly be called evidence, and should never be opposed, on"
3195,[60] I. 57.,"their own credit, to the testimony of Homer."
3196,[60] I. 57.,
3197,[60] I. 57.,"In bringing this discussion to a close, I will quote a passage"
3198,[60] I. 57.,"respecting Homer, from the Earl of Aberdeen’s _Inquiry into the"
3199,[60] I. 57.,"Principles of Beauty in Grecian Architecture_, which, I think,"
3200,[60] I. 57.,expresses with great truth and simplicity the ground of Homer’s general
3201,[60] I. 57.,"claim to authority, subject, of course, to any question respecting the"
3202,[60] I. 57.,genuineness of the received text:
3203,[60] I. 57.,
3204,[60] I. 57.,In treating of an age far removed from the approach of regular
3205,[60] I. 57.,"history, it is fortunate that we are furnished with a guide so"
3206,[60] I. 57.,"unerring as Homer, whose general accuracy of observation, and"
3207,[60] I. 57.,"minuteness of description, are such as to afford a copious source of"
3208,[60] I. 57.,information respecting almost everything connected with the times in
3209,[60] I. 57.,"which he composed his work: and who, being nearly contemporary with"
3210,[60] I. 57.,"the events which he relates, and, indeed, with the earliest matter"
3211,[60] I. 57.,"for record in Greece, cannot fall into mistakes and anachronisms in"
3212,[60] I. 57.,"arts, or manners, or government, as he might have done had he lived"
3213,[60] I. 57.,at a more advanced and refined period[120].
3214,[60] I. 57.,
3215,[60] I. 57.,"It was said of a certain Dorotheus, that he spent his whole life in"
3216,[60] I. 57.,endeavours to elucidate the meaning of the Homeric word κλισίη. Such a
3217,[60] I. 57.,disproportion between labour and its aim is somewhat startling; yet it
3218,[60] I. 57.,"is hardly too much to say, that no exertion spent upon any of the great"
3219,[60] I. 57.,"classics of the world, and attended with any amount of real result, is"
3220,[60] I. 57.,"really thrown away. It is better to write one word upon the rock, than"
3221,[60] I. 57.,a thousand on the water or the sand: better to remove a single stray
3222,[60] I. 57.,"stone out of the path that mounts the hill of true culture, than to"
3223,[60] I. 57.,"hew out miles of devious tracks, which mislead and bewilder us when we"
3224,[60] I. 57.,"travel them, and make us more than content if we are fortunate enough"
3225,[60] I. 57.,"to find, when we emerge out of their windings, that we have simply"
3226,[60] I. 57.,"returned to the point in our age, from which, in sanguine youth, we set"
3227,[60] I. 57.,out.
3228,[60] I. 57.,
3229,[60] I. 57.,As rules of the kind above propounded can only be fully understood when
3230,[60] I. 57.,"applied, the application of them has accordingly been attempted, in the"
3231,[60] I. 57.,"work to which these pages form an Introduction. In this view, it may be"
3232,[60] I. 57.,regarded as their necessary sequel. I commit it to the press with no
3233,[60] I. 57.,"inconsiderable apprehension, and with due deference to the judgments"
3234,[60] I. 57.,of the learned: for I do not feel myself to have possessed either
3235,[60] I. 57.,the fresh recollection and ready command of the treasures of ancient
3236,[60] I. 57.,"Greece, or the extended and systematic knowledge of the modern Homeric"
3237,[60] I. 57.,"literature, which are among the essential requisites of qualification"
3238,[60] I. 57.,to deal in a satisfactory manner with the subject. I should further
3239,[60] I. 57.,"say, that the poems of Homer, to be rightly and thoroughly sounded,"
3240,[60] I. 57.,"demand undoubtedly a disengaged mind, perhaps would repay even the"
3241,[60] I. 57.,"study of a life. One plea only I can advance with confidence. The work,"
3242,[60] I. 57.,"whatever else it be, is one which has been founded in good faith on"
3243,[60] I. 57.,"the text of Homer. Whether in statement or in speculation, I have"
3244,[60] I. 57.,desired and endeavoured that it should lead me by the hand: and even my
3245,[60] I. 57.,anticipations of what we might in any case expect it to contain have
3246,[60] I. 57.,been formed by a reflex process from the suggestions it had itself
3247,[60] I. 57.,supplied:
3248,[60] I. 57.,
3249,[60] I. 57.,Oh degli altri poeti onore e lume!
3250,[60] I. 57.,"Vagliami il lungo studio, e il grande amore"

3256,[60] I. 57.,"Finally, though sharing the dissatisfaction of others at the"
3257,[60] I. 57.,established preference given among us to the Latin names of deities
3258,[60] I. 57.,"originally Greek, and at some part of our orthography for Greek names,"
3259,[60] I. 57.,"I have thought it best to adhere in general to the common custom, and"
3260,[60] I. 57.,only to deviate from it where a special object was in view. I fear
3261,[60] I. 57.,"that diversity, and even confusion, are more likely to arise than any"
3262,[60] I. 57.,"benefit, from efforts at reform, made by individuals, and without"
3263,[60] I. 57.,"the advantage either of authority or of a clear principle, as a"
3264,[60] I. 57.,"groundwork for general consent. I am here disposed to say, ‘οὐκ ἀγαθὸν"
3265,[60] I. 57.,"πολυκοιρανίη;’ and again with Wordsworth,"
3266,[60] I. 57.,
3267,[60] I. 57.,‘Me this unchartered freedom tires.’
3268,[60] I. 57.,

3270,[60] I. 57.,"and especially of those who bear rule in places of education,"
3271,[60] I. 57.,"improvement might be effected, not only in the points above mentioned,"
3272,[60] I. 57.,but in our solitary and barbarous method of pronouncing both the Greek
3273,[60] I. 57.,and the Latin language. In this one respect the European world may
3274,[60] I. 57.,still with justice describe the English at least as the _penitus toto

3351,SECT. I.,"I now proceed to attempt, in a series of inquiries, the practical"
3352,SECT. I.,application of the principles which have been stated in the preliminary
3353,SECT. I.,Essay. The first of these inquiries might on some grounds be deemed
3354,SECT. I.,the most hazardous. It is an inquiry into the Early Ethnology and
3355,SECT. I.,"Ethnography of Greece: or the Composition of the Greek nation, and"
3356,SECT. I.,"the succession and Distribution of its races, according to the text"
3357,SECT. I.,"of Homer. The religion, the politics, the manners, the contemporary"
3358,SECT. I.,"history, of the Iliad and Odyssey, may justly be considered to form"
3359,SECT. I.,"essential parts of the plan of the Poet, and to have been distinctly"
3360,SECT. I.,contemplated by his intention. But into anterior legends he only dips
3361,SECT. I.,at times: and of the subject of the succession and distribution of
3362,SECT. I.,races it probably formed no part of his purpose to treat at all; so
3363,SECT. I.,"that in the endeavour to investigate it we are entirely dependent, so"
3364,SECT. I.,"far as he is concerned, upon scattered and incidental notices."
3365,SECT. I.,
3366,SECT. I.,"But here it is, that the extraordinary sureness and precision of the"
3367,SECT. I.,"mind of Homer stands us in such admirable stead. Wherever, amidst the"
3368,SECT. I.,"cloud and chaos of pre-Homeric antiquity, he enables us to discern a"
3369,SECT. I.,"luminous point, that point is a beacon, and indicates ground on which"
3370,SECT. I.,"we may tread with confidence. The materials, which at a first glance"
3371,SECT. I.,"appear upon the face of the poems to be available for our purpose,"
3372,SECT. I.,may indeed be but slender. But the careful gathering together of many
3373,SECT. I.,"dispersed indications, and the strict observation of their relative"
3374,SECT. I.,"bearings has this effect, that each fragment added to the stock may"
3375,SECT. I.,"both receive illustration from what is already known, and may give"
3376,SECT. I.,"it in return, by helping to explain and establish relations hitherto"
3377,SECT. I.,"doubtful or obscure. And as the total or gross accumulation grows, the"
3378,SECT. I.,nett result increases in a more rapid ratio: as a single known point
3379,SECT. I.,"upon a plane tells us of nothing besides itself, but two enable us"
3380,SECT. I.,"to draw a line, and three a triangle, and each further one as it is"
3381,SECT. I.,"added to construct a multitude of figures: or as in the map-puzzles,"
3382,SECT. I.,"constructed to provoke the ingenuity of children, when once a very few"
3383,SECT. I.,"countries have been laid in their right places, they serve as keys to"
3384,SECT. I.,"the rest, and we can lay out with confidence the general order. Even so"
3385,SECT. I.,"I am not without hope that, as to some parts at least of this ethnical"
3386,SECT. I.,"examination, the Homeric indications may, when brought together,"
3387,SECT. I.,warrant our applying to them words used by Cicero for another purpose:
3388,SECT. I.,"_est enim admirabilis continuatio seriesque rerum, ut aliæ ex aliis"
3389,SECT. I.,"nexæ, et omnes inter se aptæ conligatæque videantur_[122]."
3390,SECT. I.,
3391,SECT. I.,"I must not, however, step over the threshold of the investigation"
3392,SECT. I.,"without giving warning, that we have to meet at the outset an opinion"
3393,SECT. I.,"broadly pronounced, and proceeding from a person of such high authority"
3394,SECT. I.,"as Mr. Grote, our most recent historian of Greece, to the effect that"
3395,SECT. I.,these inquiries are futile. This intimation is so important that it
3396,SECT. I.,"shall stand in his own words. “In going through historical Greece,”"
3397,SECT. I.,"says Mr. Grote, “we are compelled to accept the Hellenic aggregate"
3398,SECT. I.,"with its constituent elements as a primary fact to start from,"
3399,SECT. I.,because the state of our information does not enable us to ascend any
3400,SECT. I.,"higher. By what circumstances, or out of what pre-existing elements,"
3401,SECT. I.,"this aggregate was brought together and modified, we find no evidence"
3402,SECT. I.,"entitled to credit[123].” And then, in condemnation particularly of"
3403,SECT. I.,"Pelasgic inquiries, he resumes: “if any man is inclined to call the"
3404,SECT. I.,"unknown ante-Hellenic period of Greece by the name of Pelasgic, it is"
3405,SECT. I.,open to him to do so: but this is a name carrying with it no assured
3406,SECT. I.,"predicates, no way enlarging our insight into real history, nor"
3407,SECT. I.,enabling us to explain--what would be the real historical problem--how
3408,SECT. I.,"or from whom the Hellens acquired that stock of dispositions,"
3409,SECT. I.,"aptitudes, arts, &c. with which they began their career.... No"
3410,SECT. I.,attested facts are now present to us--none were present to Herodotus
3411,SECT. I.,"and Thucydides even in their age, on which to build trustworthy"
3412,SECT. I.,affirmations respecting the ante-Hellenic Pelasgians.”
3413,SECT. I.,
3414,SECT. I.,"In answer to these passages, which raise the question no less broadly"
3415,SECT. I.,"than fairly, it may first be observed, that at least Herodotus and"
3416,SECT. I.,"Thucydides did not think what we are thus invited to think for them,"
3417,SECT. I.,"and that of the judgment of the latter, as an inquirer into matters of"
3418,SECT. I.,"fact, Mr. Grote has himself justly expressed the highest opinion[124]."
3419,SECT. I.,"Mr. Grote, placing in one category all that relates to the legendary"
3420,SECT. I.,"age, finds it as a whole intractable and unhistorical, with a"
3421,SECT. I.,predominance of sentimental attributes quite unlike the practical
3422,SECT. I.,turn and powers of the Greek mind in later times[125]. But has not
3423,SECT. I.,this disturbance of equilibrium happened chiefly because the genuine
3424,SECT. I.,"though slender historic materials of the heroic age, supplied by the"
3425,SECT. I.,"poems of Homer, have been overborne and flooded by the accumulations"
3426,SECT. I.,"made by imagination, vanity, resentment, or patriotism, during a"
3427,SECT. I.,"thousand years? Even of the unsifted mass of legend, to which the"
3428,SECT. I.,"distinguished historian refers, it may be doubted, whether it is not,"
3429,SECT. I.,"when viewed as a whole, bewildering, formless, and inconsistent, rather"
3430,SECT. I.,"than sentimental. It has been everywhere darkened by cross purposes,"
3431,SECT. I.,"and by the unauthorized meddling of generations, which had ceased to"
3432,SECT. I.,"sympathize with the heroic age. At any rate, I crave permission to try"
3433,SECT. I.,"what we can make of that age in the matter of history, by dealing first"
3434,SECT. I.,"and foremost with him who handled it for the purposes of history, apart"
3435,SECT. I.,"from those, I mean the after poets, tragedians, and logographers, to"
3436,SECT. I.,whom it was little more than a romance.
3437,SECT. I.,
3438,SECT. I.,I trust that the recent examples of men so learned and able as Bishop
3439,SECT. I.,"Thirlwall and K. O. Müller, neither of whom have thought subjects"
3440,SECT. I.,"of this kind too uninviting to reward inquiry, may avail both to"
3441,SECT. I.,"prevent the interposition of a preliminary bar to the discussion, and"
3442,SECT. I.,to protect it against an adverse prejudgment. By anticipation I can
3443,SECT. I.,"reasonably make no other answer to a condemnatory sentence, than that"
3444,SECT. I.,"which is conveyed in the words ‘let us try.’ But at any rate, _est"
3445,SECT. I.,operæ pretium_: the stake is worth the venture. He would be indeed a
3446,SECT. I.,"worthless biographer who did not, so far as his materials carried him,"
3447,SECT. I.,pursue the life of a hero back to the nursery or even the cradle: and
3448,SECT. I.,the same faithful and well-grounded instincts invest with a surpassing
3449,SECT. I.,"interest all real elucidation of the facts and ideas, that make up the"
3450,SECT. I.,image of the Greek nation either in its infancy or even in its embryo.
3451,SECT. I.,
3452,SECT. I.,"There are three and only three names of ordinary use in the Iliad,"
3453,SECT. I.,by which the poet designates the people that had been banded together
3454,SECT. I.,"against Troy. This same people afterwards became famous in history,"
3455,SECT. I.,"perhaps beyond all others, first by the name of Hellenes, which was"
3456,SECT. I.,"self-applied; and secondly by the name of Greeks, which they acquired"
3457,SECT. I.,from their Italian conquerors and captives. Greece is now again become
3458,SECT. I.,Hellas.
3459,SECT. I.,
3460,SECT. I.,"These names, prominent far beyond all others, are,"
3461,SECT. I.,
3462,SECT. I.,"1. Δαναοὶ, Danaans."
3463,SECT. I.,
3464,SECT. I.,"2. Ἀργεῖοι, Argeians or Argives."
3465,SECT. I.,
3466,SECT. I.,"3. Ἀχαιοὶ, Achæans."
3467,SECT. I.,
3468,SECT. I.,They are commonly treated as synonymous. It appears at least to have
3469,SECT. I.,been assumed that they are incapable of yielding any practical results
3470,SECT. I.,to an attempt at historic analysis and distribution. To try this
3471,SECT. I.,"question fully, is a main part of my present purpose. Thus much at"
3472,SECT. I.,"least is clear: that they seem to be the equivalents, for the Troic"
3473,SECT. I.,"period, of the Hellenic name in later times."
3474,SECT. I.,
3475,SECT. I.,"But there are other names, of various classes, which on account of"
3476,SECT. I.,their relations to the foregoing ones it is material to bring into view.
3477,SECT. I.,
3478,SECT. I.,"First, there are found in Homer two other designations, which purport"
3479,SECT. I.,to have the same effect as the three already quoted. They are
3480,SECT. I.,
3481,SECT. I.,"1. Παναχαιοὶ, Panachæans."
3482,SECT. I.,
3483,SECT. I.,"2. Πανέλληνες, Panhellenes."
3484,SECT. I.,
3485,SECT. I.,"Next come three names of races, whose relations to the foregoing"
3486,SECT. I.,appellations will demand scrutiny. These are
3487,SECT. I.,
3488,SECT. I.,"1. Πελασγοὶ, Pelasgians."
3489,SECT. I.,
3490,SECT. I.,"2. Ἕλληνες, Hellenes."
3491,SECT. I.,
3492,SECT. I.,"3. Θρῇκες, Thracians, or rather Thraces."
3493,SECT. I.,
3494,SECT. I.,"Lastly, there are a more numerous class of names, which are local in"
3495,SECT. I.,"this sense, that Homer only mentions them in connection with particular"
3496,SECT. I.,"parts of Greece, but which being clearly tribal and not territorial,"
3497,SECT. I.,"stand clearly distinguished from the names which owed, or may have"
3498,SECT. I.,"owed, their origin to the different cities or districts of the country,"
3499,SECT. I.,"such as Phocian (Il. ii. 517), Rhodian (654), Elian (Il. xi. 670), or"
3500,SECT. I.,Ithacan (Odyssey _passim_): and likewise from the names which already
3501,SECT. I.,"were, or afterwards came to be, in established connection with those"
3502,SECT. I.,"of districts, though they have no appearance of having been originally"
3503,SECT. I.,"territorial: such as Arcadian (Il. ii. 603, 611), Bœotian (Il. ii."
3504,SECT. I.,"494), Athenian (Il. ii. 546, 551)."
3505,SECT. I.,
3506,SECT. I.,Of the class now before us there are some which are of importance in
3507,SECT. I.,various degrees with regard to the views of primitive history to be
3508,SECT. I.,gathered from the Homeric poems. As such I rank
3509,SECT. I.,
3510,SECT. I.,"1. Καδμεῖοι, Cadmeans, in Thebes, Il. iv. 388 and elsewhere: and with"
3511,SECT. I.,"this, as an equivalent, Καδμείωνες, Il. iv. 385 and elsewhere."
3512,SECT. I.,
3513,SECT. I.,"2. Ἰάονες, Ionians, in Athens, Il. xiii. 685."
3514,SECT. I.,
3515,SECT. I.,"3. Δωριέες, Dorians, in Crete, Od. xix. 177. A town Dorion is also"
3516,SECT. I.,"mentioned in the Catalogue as within the territories of Nestor, Il. ii."
3517,SECT. I.,594.
3518,SECT. I.,
3519,SECT. I.,"4. Κεφάλληνες, Cephallenes, in the islands under Ulysses, Il. ii. 631."
3520,SECT. I.,
3521,SECT. I.,"5. Ἐφυροὶ, Ephyri, in Thessaly, Il. xiii. 301."
3522,SECT. I.,
3523,SECT. I.,"6. Σελλοὶ or Ἑλλοὶ, Helli, in northern Thessaly, Il. xvi. 234."
3524,SECT. I.,
3525,SECT. I.,"7. Καύκωνες, Caucones, in southern Greece, Od. iii. 366: (and among the"
3526,SECT. I.,"Trojan allies, Il. x. 429, xx. 329.)"
3527,SECT. I.,
3528,SECT. I.,"8. Ἐπεῖοι, Epeans, in Elis, Il. ii. 619, and on the opposite or"
3529,SECT. I.,"northern coast and islands of the Corinthian Gulf: compare Il. ii. 627,"
3530,SECT. I.,and xiii. 691.
3531,SECT. I.,
3532,SECT. I.,"9. Ἄβαντες, Abantes, in Eubœa, Il. ii. 536."
3533,SECT. I.,
3534,SECT. I.,"10. Μυρμίδονες, Myrmidones, in Phthia, Il. ii. 684."
3535,SECT. I.,
3536,SECT. I.,"11. Κουρῆτες, Curetes, in Ætolia, Il. ix. 529."
3537,SECT. I.,
3538,SECT. I.,"12. Φλεγύαι, Phlegyæ, in Thessaly, Il. xiii. 301."
3539,SECT. I.,
3540,SECT. I.,"13. Φῆρες, in Thessaly, Il. i. 267, 8, ii. 733, 4."
3541,SECT. I.,
3542,SECT. I.,"And lastly it may be mentioned that in the single word Γραῖα, used (Il."
3543,SECT. I.,"ii. 498) to designate one of the numerous Bœotian towns, we have an"
3544,SECT. I.,isolated indication of the existence in the heroic times of the germ of
3545,SECT. I.,"the names _Greece_ and _Greek_, which afterwards ascended to, and still"
3546,SECT. I.,"retain, such extraordinary fame."
3547,SECT. I.,
3548,SECT. I.,"The Homeric text will afford us means of investigation, more or less,"
3549,SECT. I.,"for the greater part of these names, but the main thread of the inquiry"
3550,SECT. I.,"runs with these five; Pelasgians, Hellenes, Danaans, Argeians, Achæans."
3551,SECT. I.,
3552,SECT. I.,"In conjunction with the present subject, I shall consider what light"
3553,SECT. I.,is thrown by Homer on the relations of the Greeks with other races not
3554,SECT. I.,"properly Greek: the Lycians, the Phœnicians, the Sicels, the Egyptians,"
3555,SECT. I.,"the people of Cyprus, and finally the Persians. The name of the Leleges"
3556,SECT. I.,will be considered in conjunction with that of the Caucones.

3578,SECT. II.,
3579,SECT. II.,It will be most convenient to begin with the case of the Pelasgians:
3580,SECT. II.,and the questions we shall have to investigate will be substantially
3581,SECT. II.,reducible to the following heads:
3582,SECT. II.,
3583,SECT. II.,1. Are the Pelasgians essentially Greek?
3584,SECT. II.,
3585,SECT. II.,"2. If so, what is their relation to the Hellenes, and to the integral"
3586,SECT. II.,Greek nation?
3587,SECT. II.,
3588,SECT. II.,3. What elements did they contribute to the formation of the composite
3589,SECT. II.,body thus called?
3590,SECT. II.,
3591,SECT. II.,4. What was their language?
3592,SECT. II.,
3593,SECT. II.,5. What was the derivation of their name?
3594,SECT. II.,
3595,SECT. II.,6. By what route did they come into Greece?
3596,SECT. II.,
3597,SECT. II.,The direct evidence of the Homeric poems with respect to the Pelasgians
3598,SECT. II.,is scattered and faint. It derives however material aid from various
3599,SECT. II.,"branches of tradition, partly conveyed in the Homeric poems, and partly"
3600,SECT. II.,"extraneous to them, particularly religion, language, and pursuits."
3601,SECT. II.,"Evidence legitimately drawn from these latter sources, wherever it is"
3602,SECT. II.,"in the nature of circumstantial proof, is far superior in authority to"
3603,SECT. II.,"such literary traditions as are surrounded, at their visible source,"
3604,SECT. II.,with circumstances of uncertainty.
3605,SECT. II.,
3606,SECT. II.,_The Pelasgians._
3607,SECT. II.,
3608,SECT. II.,"I. The first passage, with which we have to deal, is that portion of"
3609,SECT. II.,"the Catalogue of the Greek armament, where Homer introduces us to the"
3610,SECT. II.,contingent of Achilles in the following lines:
3611,SECT. II.,
3612,SECT. II.,"Νῦν αὖ τοὺς ὅσσοι τὸ Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος ἔναιον,"
3613,SECT. II.,"Οἵ τ’ Ἄλον οἵ τ’ Ἀλόπην οἵ τε Τρηχῖν’ ἐνέμοντο,"
3614,SECT. II.,"Οἵ τ’ εἶχον Φθίην ἠδ’ Ἑλλάδα καλλιγύναικα,"
3615,SECT. II.,"Μυρμιδόνες δὲ καλεῦντο καὶ Ἕλληνες καὶ Ἀχαιοὶ,"
3616,SECT. II.,Τῶν αὖ πεντήκοντα νεῶν ἦν ἀρχὸς Ἀχιλλεύς[126].
3617,SECT. II.,
3618,SECT. II.,"All evidence goes to show, that Thessaly stood in a most important"
3619,SECT. II.,relation to the infant life of the Greek races; whether we consider it
3620,SECT. II.,as the seat of many most ancient legends; as dignified by the presence
3621,SECT. II.,"of Dodona, the highest seat of religious tradition and authority to"
3622,SECT. II.,the Greeks; as connected with the two ancient names of Helli and
3623,SECT. II.,Pelasgi: or lastly in regard to the prominence it retained even down
3624,SECT. II.,to and during the historic age in the constitution of the Amphictyonic
3625,SECT. II.,Council[127]. All these indications are in harmony with the course of
3626,SECT. II.,Greek ethnological tradition.
3627,SECT. II.,
3628,SECT. II.,Now the Catalogue of the Greek armament is divided into three great
3629,SECT. II.,sections.
3630,SECT. II.,
3631,SECT. II.,"The first comprises Continental Greece, with the islands immediately"
3632,SECT. II.,"adjacent to the coast, and lying south of Thessaly. The second consists"
3633,SECT. II.,of the Greek islands of the Ægean. The third is wholly Thessalian: and
3634,SECT. II.,it begins with the lines which have been quoted.
3635,SECT. II.,
3636,SECT. II.,_The Pelasgians: Pelasgic Argos._
3637,SECT. II.,
3638,SECT. II.,What then does Homer mean us to understand by the phrase τὸ Πελασγικὸν
3639,SECT. II.,Ἄργος in this passage? Is it
3640,SECT. II.,
3641,SECT. II.,"1. A mere town, or town and district, like Alos, Alope, and others"
3642,SECT. II.,which follow; or is it
3643,SECT. II.,
3644,SECT. II.,2. A country comprising several or many such?
3645,SECT. II.,
3646,SECT. II.,"And if the latter, does it describe"
3647,SECT. II.,
3648,SECT. II.,"1. That country only over which Peleus reigned, and which supplied the"
3649,SECT. II.,Myrmidon division; or
3650,SECT. II.,
3651,SECT. II.,2. A more extended country?
3652,SECT. II.,
3653,SECT. II.,First let us remark the use of the article. It is not the manner of
3654,SECT. II.,Homer to employ the article with the proper names of places. We may
3655,SECT. II.,be sure that it carries with it a distinctive force: as in the Trojan
3656,SECT. II.,Catalogue he employs it to indicate a particular race or body of
3657,SECT. II.,Pelasgians[128] apart from others. Now the distinctive force of the
3658,SECT. II.,article here may have either or both of two bearings.
3659,SECT. II.,
3660,SECT. II.,1. It may mark off the Argos of the Pelasgians from one or more other
3661,SECT. II.,countries or places bearing the name of Argos.
3662,SECT. II.,
3663,SECT. II.,"2. Even independently of the epithet, the article may be rightly"
3664,SECT. II.,"employed, if Argos itself be not strictly a proper name, but rather a"
3665,SECT. II.,descriptive word indicating the physical character of a given region.
3666,SECT. II.,"Thus ‘Scotland’ is strictly a proper name, ‘Lowlands’ a descriptive"
3667,SECT. II.,word of this nature: and the latter takes the article where the former
3668,SECT. II.,does not require or even admit it. And now let us proceed to make our
3669,SECT. II.,selection between the various alternatives before us.
3670,SECT. II.,
3671,SECT. II.,"Whichever of the two bearings we give to the article, it seems"
3672,SECT. II.,of itself to preclude the supposition that a mere town or single
3673,SECT. II.,settlement can be here intended: for nowhere does Homer give the
3674,SECT. II.,article to a name of that class.
3675,SECT. II.,
3676,SECT. II.,"Secondly, in almost every place where Homer speaks of an Argos, he"
3677,SECT. II.,"makes it plain that he does not mean a mere town or single settlement,"
3678,SECT. II.,but a country including towns or settlements within it. The exceptions
3679,SECT. II.,"to this rule are rare. In Il. iv. 52 we have one of them, where he"
3680,SECT. II.,"combines Argos with Sparta and Mycenæ, and calls all three by the name"
3681,SECT. II.,of cities. The line Il. ii. 559 probably supplies another. But in a
3682,SECT. II.,later Section[129] the general rule will be fully illustrated.
3683,SECT. II.,
3684,SECT. II.,"It will also clearly appear, that the name Argos is in fact a"
3685,SECT. II.,"descriptive word, not a proper name, and is nearly equivalent to our"
3686,SECT. II.,‘Lowlands’ or to the Italian ‘campagna.’
3687,SECT. II.,
3688,SECT. II.,"Thirdly: in many other places of the Catalogue, Homer begins by placing"
3689,SECT. II.,"in the front, as it were, the comprehensive name which overrides and"
3690,SECT. II.,"includes the particular names that are to follow; and then, without any"
3691,SECT. II.,other distinctive mark than the use of the faint enclitic copulative
3692,SECT. II.,"τε, proceeds to enumerate parts included within the whole which he has"
3693,SECT. II.,previously named. Thus for instance

3715,SECT. II.,
3716,SECT. II.,"We may therefore consider the verse 681,"
3717,SECT. II.,
3718,SECT. II.,"Νῦν αὖ τοὺς, ὅσσοι τὸ Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος ἔναιον·"
3719,SECT. II.,
3720,SECT. II.,"as prefatory, and I print it, accordingly, so as to mark a pause."
3721,SECT. II.,
3722,SECT. II.,"But, again, is it prefatory only to the division of Achilles, and"
3723,SECT. II.,is it simply the integer expressing the whole territory from which
3724,SECT. II.,"his contingent was drawn, or is it prefatory to the whole remainder"
3725,SECT. II.,"of the Catalogue, ending at v. 759, and does it include all the nine"
3726,SECT. II.,territorial divisions described therein? There is no grammatical or
3727,SECT. II.,"other reason for the former alternative, while various considerations"
3728,SECT. II.,recommend the latter.
3729,SECT. II.,
3730,SECT. II.,There is no sign in the poems of any connection between Achilles with
3731,SECT. II.,"his Myrmidons, or between the kingdom of his father Peleus, and any"
3732,SECT. II.,"particular part of Thessaly under the name of Argos, or Pelasgic Argos."
3733,SECT. II.,Although the division of Achilles did not embrace the whole of the
3734,SECT. II.,"Phthians[130], yet Phthia appears to be the proper description of his"
3735,SECT. II.,"territory, so far as it has a collective name: and there are signs,"
3736,SECT. II.,"which will be hereafter considered, that the name of Phthia itself was"
3737,SECT. II.,embraced and included within the wider range of another name.
3738,SECT. II.,
3739,SECT. II.,"Again, the Pelasgic name, as will be further observed, is not in Homer"
3740,SECT. II.,"specially connected with the South of Thessaly, where the realm of"
3741,SECT. II.,"Peleus lay, but rather with the North, the towns and settlements of"
3742,SECT. II.,"which are enumerated, not in the first, but in the later paragraphs of"
3743,SECT. II.,this portion of the Catalogue.
3744,SECT. II.,
3745,SECT. II.,"In the invocation of the Sixteenth Book, to which reference will"
3746,SECT. II.,"shortly be made, Achilles at once addresses Jupiter as Pelasgic, and as"
3747,SECT. II.,"dwelling afar (τηλόθι ναίων): therefore, the special Thessalian seat of"
3748,SECT. II.,the god could not be in the dominions of Peleus.
3749,SECT. II.,
3750,SECT. II.,"We have observed, again, in the earlier parts of the catalogue various"
3751,SECT. II.,"collective names, afterwards explained distributively, for the various"
3752,SECT. II.,contingents: but there is not one of this class of names employed
3753,SECT. II.,for any of the Eight Divisions which follow that of Achilles. They
3754,SECT. II.,"all seem to bear the form of particular distributive enumerations,"
3755,SECT. II.,belonging to the comprehensive head of Pelasgic Argos or Thessaly.
3756,SECT. II.,
3757,SECT. II.,"There is also something in the obvious break in the Catalogue,"
3758,SECT. II.,signified by the words
3759,SECT. II.,
3760,SECT. II.,νῦν αὖ τοὺς ὅσσοι ...
3761,SECT. II.,
3762,SECT. II.,"which indicate, as it were, a completely new starting point. There"
3763,SECT. II.,is nothing else resembling them. They form the introduction to a new
3764,SECT. II.,"chapter of the lists, after a geographical transition from the islands:"
3765,SECT. II.,"and there is no reason for these marked words, if Pelasgic Argos was"
3766,SECT. II.,"either a mere town district, or a local sovereignty, but a very good"
3767,SECT. II.,"reason, if Pelasgic Argos meant that great integral portion of the"
3768,SECT. II.,"Greek territory, the vale of Thessaly, the particular parts of which"
3769,SECT. II.,the Poet was about to set forth in so much detail.
3770,SECT. II.,
3771,SECT. II.,"It may therefore be inferred, that the epithet Πελασγικὸν is applied"
3772,SECT. II.,"by Homer to the Thessalian vale collectively, as it is contained"
3773,SECT. II.,"between the mountains of Pindus to the west, Œta and Olympus to the"
3774,SECT. II.,"north, Othrys to the south, and Ossa or the sea to the east. We might,"
3775,SECT. II.,"without geographical error, translate the phrase τὸ Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος"
3776,SECT. II.,"of the second Iliad by that name of Thessaly[131], which the country"
3777,SECT. II.,"afterwards acquired: but the idea which it properly indicates to us,"
3778,SECT. II.,"is, _that Argos which had been settled by the Pelasgians_."
3779,SECT. II.,
3780,SECT. II.,"It is the only geographical epithet which, applied to the name Argos,"
3781,SECT. II.,belongs to the north of Greece: and it is so applied by way of
3782,SECT. II.,distinction and opposition to other uses of the name Argos in other
3783,SECT. II.,"parts of the poems, which we shall hereafter have to examine, namely,"
3784,SECT. II.,the Achaic and the Iasian Argos.
3785,SECT. II.,
3786,SECT. II.,_The Pelasgians: Dodona._
3787,SECT. II.,
3788,SECT. II.,II. Perhaps the most solemn invocation of Jupiter as the great deity of
3789,SECT. II.,"the Greeks in the whole of the Poems is where Achilles, sending forth"
3790,SECT. II.,"Patroclus to battle, prays that glory may be given him. It runs thus"
3791,SECT. II.,(Il. xvi. 233-5):
3792,SECT. II.,
3793,SECT. II.,"Ζεῦ ἄνα, Δωδωναῖε, Πελασγικὲ, τηλόθι ναίων,"
3794,SECT. II.,Δωδώνης μεδέων δυσχειμέρου· ἀμφὶ δέ σ’ Ἕλλοι
3795,SECT. II.,σοὶ ναίουσ’ ὑποφῆται ἀνιπτόποδες χαμαιεῦναι.
3796,SECT. II.,
3797,SECT. II.,"It seems not too much to say upon this remarkable passage, that it"
3798,SECT. II.,"shows us, as it were, the nation pitching its first altar upon its"
3799,SECT. II.,first arrival in the country. It bears witness that those who brought
3800,SECT. II.,"the worship of Dodonæan Jupiter were Pelasgians, as well as that the"
3801,SECT. II.,"spot, which they chose for the principal seat of their worship, was"
3802,SECT. II.,Dodona. For the appeal of Achilles on this occasion is evidently the
3803,SECT. II.,"most forcible that he has it in his power to make, and is addressed to"
3804,SECT. II.,the highest source of Divine power that he knew.
3805,SECT. II.,
3806,SECT. II.,"It has been debated, but apparently without any conclusive result, what"
3807,SECT. II.,was the site of the Dodona so famous in the after-times of Greece[132].
3808,SECT. II.,"It seems clear, however, that it was a Dodona to the westward of"
3809,SECT. II.,"Pindus, and belonging to Thesprotia or Molossia. But this plainly was"
3810,SECT. II.,not the position of the Dodona we have now before us. For in a passage
3811,SECT. II.,"of the Catalogue Homer distinctly places this Dodona in Thessaly,"
3812,SECT. II.,"giving it the same epithet, δυσχείμερος, as Achilles applies to it in"
3813,SECT. II.,"Il. xvi. Gouneus, he says, was followed by the Enienes and Perrhæbi,"
3814,SECT. II.,
3815,SECT. II.,"οἱ περὶ Δωδώνην δυσχείμερον οἴκι’ ἔθεντο,"
3816,SECT. II.,οἵ τ’ ἀμφ’ ἱμερτὸν Τιταρήσιον ἔργ’ ἐνέμοντο[133].
3817,SECT. II.,
3818,SECT. II.,Both the name of the Perrhæbi and that of the river Titaresius fix the
3819,SECT. II.,Dodona of Homer in the north of Thessaly. And the character assigned
3820,SECT. II.,"to this Titaresius, so near Dodona, as a branch of Styx, ‘the mighty"
3821,SECT. II.,"adjuration of the gods,’ well illustrates the close connection between"
3822,SECT. II.,"that river, by which the other deities were to swear, and Jupiter,"
3823,SECT. II.,"who was their chief, and was in a certain sense the administrator of"
3824,SECT. II.,"justice among them. In the Odyssey, indeed, Ulysses, in his fictitious"
3825,SECT. II.,"narrations to Eumæus and Penelope, represents himself as having"
3826,SECT. II.,"travelled from Thesprotia to consult the oracle of Jupiter, that was"
3827,SECT. II.,delivered from a lofty oak[134]. But no presumption of nearness can be
3828,SECT. II.,founded on this passage such as to justify our assuming the existence
3829,SECT. II.,of a separate Dodona westward of the mountains in the Homeric age:
3830,SECT. II.,and there was no reason why Ulysses should not represent himself as
3831,SECT. II.,travelling through the passes of Mount Pindus[135] from the Ambracian
3832,SECT. II.,gulf into Thessaly to learn his fate. Nor upon the other hand is there
3833,SECT. II.,any vast difficulty in adopting the supposition which the evidence in
3834,SECT. II.,"the case suggests, that the oracle of Dodonæan Jupiter may have changed"
3835,SECT. II.,its seat before the historic age. The evidence of Homer places it in
3836,SECT. II.,"Thessaly, and Homer is, as we shall see, corroborated by Hesiod. After"
3837,SECT. II.,"them, we hear nothing of a Dodona having its seat in Thessaly, but"
3838,SECT. II.,much of one on the western side of the peninsula. As in later times we
3839,SECT. II.,"find Perrhæbi and Dolopes to the westward of Pindus, whom Homer shows"
3840,SECT. II.,"us only on the east, even so in the course of time the oracle may have"
3841,SECT. II.,"travelled in the same direction[136]. It is highly improbable, from"
3842,SECT. II.,"the manner in which the name is used, that there should have been two"
3843,SECT. II.,Greek Dodonas in the Homeric age.
3844,SECT. II.,
3845,SECT. II.,"However, the very passage before us indicates, that revolution"
3846,SECT. II.,had already laid its hand on this ancient seat of Greek religion.
3847,SECT. II.,"For though the Dodona of Homer was Pelasgic by its origin, its"
3848,SECT. II.,"neighbourhood was now inhabited by a different race, the Selli or"
3849,SECT. II.,"Helli, and these Helli were also the ὑποφῆται or ministers of the"
3850,SECT. II.,deity. While their rude and filthy habits of life mark them as probably
3851,SECT. II.,"a people of recent arrival, who had not themselves yet emerged from"
3852,SECT. II.,"their highland home, and from the struggle with want and difficulty,"
3853,SECT. II.,"into civilized life, still they had begun to encroach upon the"
3854,SECT. II.,"Pelasgians with their inviting possessions and more settled habits, and"
3855,SECT. II.,"had acquired by force or otherwise the control of the temple, though"
3856,SECT. II.,without obliterating the tradition of its Pelasgic origin. The very
3857,SECT. II.,"fact, that the Helli were at the time the ministers of Jupiter, tends"
3858,SECT. II.,to confirm the belief that the Pelasgians were those who originally
3859,SECT. II.,established it; for how otherwise could the name of the Pelasgian race
3860,SECT. II.,have found its way into an Hellenic invocation?
3861,SECT. II.,
3862,SECT. II.,"Thus, as before we found that what we term Thessaly is to Homer ‘the"
3863,SECT. II.,"Argos of the Pelasgians,’ so we now find that people associated with"
3864,SECT. II.,"the original and central worship of the Greek Jupiter, as having"
3865,SECT. II.,probably been the race to whom it owed its establishment.
3866,SECT. II.,
3867,SECT. II.,"And thus, though the Pelasgians were not politically predominant in"
3868,SECT. II.,"Thessaly at the epoch of the _Troica_, yet Thessaly is Pelasgian Argos:"
3869,SECT. II.,"though they were not possessed of the Dodonæan oracle, yet Jupiter of"
3870,SECT. II.,"Dodona is Pelasgian Jupiter: two branches of testimony, the first of"
3871,SECT. II.,"which exhibits them as the earliest known colonisers of the country,"
3872,SECT. II.,and the second as the reputed founders of the prime article of its
3873,SECT. II.,religion.
3874,SECT. II.,
3875,SECT. II.,We must not quit this subject without referring to the evidence of
3876,SECT. II.,"Hesiod, which, though second in importance to that of Homer, is before"
3877,SECT. II.,any other literary testimony. He refers twice to Dodona. Neither time
3878,SECT. II.,does he appear to carry it to the westward. In one passage he connects
3879,SECT. II.,it immediately with the Pelasgians;
3880,SECT. II.,
3881,SECT. II.,"Δωδώνην, φῆγόν τε, Πελασγῶν ἕδρανον, ἧκεν[137]."
3882,SECT. II.,
3883,SECT. II.,"In the other passage, he associates it with the Hellic name through the"
3884,SECT. II.,medium of the territorial designation Hellopia:
3885,SECT. II.,
3886,SECT. II.,"ἐστί τις Ἑλλοπίη πολυλήϊος ἠδ’ εὐλείμων,"
3887,SECT. II.,ἔνθα τε Δωδώνη τις ἐπ’ ἐσχατίῃ πεπόλισται[138].
3888,SECT. II.,
3889,SECT. II.,"Thus, in exact accordance with Homer, he associates Dodona with two"
3890,SECT. II.,"and only two names of race, the same two as those with which it is"
3891,SECT. II.,associated in the invocation of Achilles.
3892,SECT. II.,
3893,SECT. II.,_Thessaly and the Southern Islands._
3894,SECT. II.,
3895,SECT. II.,"III. Next, we find in Homer a widely spread connection between Thessaly"
3896,SECT. II.,and the islands which form as it were the base of the Ægean sea.
3897,SECT. II.,
3898,SECT. II.,From these islands he enumerates four contingents furnished to the
3899,SECT. II.,Greek army:
3900,SECT. II.,
3901,SECT. II.,"1. From Crete, under Idomeneus (Il. ii. 645)."
3902,SECT. II.,
3903,SECT. II.,"2. From Rhodes, under Tlepolemus (653)."
3904,SECT. II.,
3905,SECT. II.,"3. From Syme, under Nireus (671)."
3906,SECT. II.,
3907,SECT. II.,"4. From Nisyrus, the Calydnæ, and other minor islands, under Pheidippus"
3908,SECT. II.,and Antiphus (676).
3909,SECT. II.,
3910,SECT. II.,1. As to Crete. Universal tradition connects the name of Deucalion with
3911,SECT. II.,"Thessaly. But he was the son, according to Homer, of Minos, who was the"
3912,SECT. II.,"ruler or warden of Crete (Κρήτῃ ἐπίουρος, Il. xiii. 450): and he was"
3913,SECT. II.,"also the father of Idomeneus, leader of the Cretans before Troy (Il."
3914,SECT. II.,"xiii. 452), and ruler over many of them (ibid.), but not, so far as"
3915,SECT. II.,"appears, over the whole island."
3916,SECT. II.,
3917,SECT. II.,"Now Minos was not only king of all Crete, but son of Jupiter (ibid.,"
3918,SECT. II.,and Od. xi. 568) by a Phœnician damsel of great note (Il. xiv. 321); we
3919,SECT. II.,"must therefore regard him, or his mother, as having come from Phœnicia"
3920,SECT. II.,"into Crete. The inference would be, that Deucalion came from Crete to"
3921,SECT. II.,"Thessaly, and that he, or Idomeneus his son, re-migrated to Crete."
3922,SECT. II.,Homer does not indeed state that Deucalion was ever in Thessaly: but
3923,SECT. II.,he indirectly supports the tradition both by placing Idomeneus in a
3924,SECT. II.,"different position in Crete from that of his grandfather Minos, and"
3925,SECT. II.,otherwise[139]. This supposition would at once reconcile the later
3926,SECT. II.,"tradition with Homer, and explain to us why the grandson of Minos only"
3927,SECT. II.,filled an inferior position.
3928,SECT. II.,
3929,SECT. II.,"Again, as we see that Thessaly is Pelasgic, and that the Thessalian"
3930,SECT. II.,"Myrmidons are called Achæans, so likewise we find among the five"
3931,SECT. II.,"nations of Crete both Pelasgians and Achæans[140]. Here, according to"
3932,SECT. II.,"Strabo, Staphylus described these two races as inhabiting the plains,"
3933,SECT. II.,"and Andron reported them, as also the Dorians, to have come from"
3934,SECT. II.,"Thessaly: erroneously, says Strabo (x. 4., p. 476), making the mother"
3935,SECT. II.,city of the Dorians a mere colony from the Thessalians. And the ancient
3936,SECT. II.,tradition which places the infant Jupiter in Crete (‘Jovis incunabula
3937,SECT. II.,"Creten’), concurs with the idea which the above-named facts would"
3938,SECT. II.,"suggest, that the Pelasgians may have come, at least in part, from the"
3939,SECT. II.,southern islands of the Ægean.
3940,SECT. II.,
3941,SECT. II.,"2. As to Rhodes. Tlepolemus, its chieftain, is the son of Hercules, and"
3942,SECT. II.,"of Astyochea, whom, in the course of his raids, he took from Ephyra by"
3943,SECT. II.,"the river Selleeis. It is questioned which Ephyra, and which Selleeis,"
3944,SECT. II.,"for of both there were several, these may have been. If they were in"
3945,SECT. II.,"Thessaly[141], we have thus a line of connection established between"
3946,SECT. II.,Thessaly and Rhodes.
3947,SECT. II.,
3948,SECT. II.,"3. As to the contingent from Nisyrus, the Calydnæ, and Cos. Firstly, it"
3949,SECT. II.,"was commanded by Pheidippus and Antiphus (678), sons of Thessalus, the"
3950,SECT. II.,"son of Hercules. The connection between Hercules and Thessaly, which"
3951,SECT. II.,"is agreeable to the general course of tradition, also harmonises with"
3952,SECT. II.,the most natural construction which can be put upon this passage of
3953,SECT. II.,"Homer: namely, that this Thessalus was the person who afterwards became"
3954,SECT. II.,"the eponymist of Thessaly, that he was a native or inhabitant of the"
3955,SECT. II.,"country, and that either he, or more probably his sons, were emigrants"
3956,SECT. II.,from it to the islands.
3957,SECT. II.,
3958,SECT. II.,"His name, latent for a time, may afterwards have attained to its"
3959,SECT. II.,"elevation, as a means of connecting Thessaly with Hercules, when the"
3960,SECT. II.,descendants of that hero had become predominant in the South. Perhaps
3961,SECT. II.,the appearance of the post-Homeric name ‘Doris’ may be explained in the
3962,SECT. II.,same manner.
3963,SECT. II.,
3964,SECT. II.,"Secondly, Cos is described as the city of Eurypylus. This may mean a"
3965,SECT. II.,city which he had founded; or a city which was then actually under his
3966,SECT. II.,"dominion. Beyond all doubt, it indicates a very special connection"
3967,SECT. II.,"of some kind between Cos and Eurypylus. Now, his name is mentioned"
3968,SECT. II.,"without adjunct. Had he been a deceased founder of the city, he would"
3969,SECT. II.,probably have been called θεῖος like Thoas (Il. xiv. 230). If he was
3970,SECT. II.,"living, who was he? We have in the Iliad one very famous Eurypylus,"
3971,SECT. II.,who appears among the nine foremost of the Greek heroes (Il. vii.
3972,SECT. II.,"167), and whose rank entitled him (xi. 818) to be called Διοτρεφής; an"
3973,SECT. II.,"epithet confined, as is probable, to Kings[142]. Now although Homer"
3974,SECT. II.,"allows himself, when he is dealing with secondary persons, to apply"
3975,SECT. II.,"the same name to more than one individual, without always caring to"
3976,SECT. II.,"discriminate between them, there is no instance in which he does this"
3977,SECT. II.,"for a person of the class of Eurypylus. This probably, therefore, is"
3978,SECT. II.,"the same Eurypylus, as meets us in other parts of the poem, the son of"
3979,SECT. II.,"Euæmon. But from the Catalogue[143], it appears that he commanded the"
3980,SECT. II.,"contingent from Ormenium in Thessaly. If then, the same person, who"
3981,SECT. II.,"founded or had some special relation to Cos, was also the commander"
3982,SECT. II.,"of a Thessalian force, here we have a new track of connection between"
3983,SECT. II.,Thessaly and the islands to the southward.
3984,SECT. II.,
3985,SECT. II.,"4. Nireus, named by Homer for his beauty alone, with his three ships"
3986,SECT. II.,"from Syme, can scarcely be said to make an unit in the Greek catalogue."
3987,SECT. II.,
3988,SECT. II.,"With this one inconsiderable exception, we find in all the cases of"
3989,SECT. II.,"island contingents a connection subsisting between them and Thessaly,"
3990,SECT. II.,"and this connection not appearing to be mediate, along the line of"
3991,SECT. II.,mainland which reaches from Thessaly to within a short distance from
3992,SECT. II.,"Crete, but apparently maintained directly by the maritime route: a fact"
3993,SECT. II.,of importance in considering the probable extension and movement of the
3994,SECT. II.,"Pelasgic race, which we find existing in both regions. We know from"
3995,SECT. II.,Homer[144] that the southern islands were a common route connecting
3996,SECT. II.,Greece with the East. There are also abundant traces of migration by
3997,SECT. II.,the northern coast of the Ægean. Thus it is at both those gates of
3998,SECT. II.,"Greece, that we find the Pelasgian name subsisting in the time of"
3999,SECT. II.,"Homer, when in the nearer vicinity of the centre of Achæan power it was"
4000,SECT. II.,already extinct.
4001,SECT. II.,
4002,SECT. II.,_The Pelasgians._
4003,SECT. II.,
4004,SECT. II.,"IV. Again, I think we may trace the near connection between the"
4005,SECT. II.,Pelasgians and the Greek nation in the laudatory epithets with which
4006,SECT. II.,the former are mentioned by Homer. We must here keep in mind on the one
4007,SECT. II.,hand the extraordinary skill and care with which the Poet employed his
4008,SECT. II.,"epithets, and on the other hand, his never failing solicitude to exalt"
4009,SECT. II.,and adorn every thing Greek.
4010,SECT. II.,
4011,SECT. II.,"Homer names the Pelasgians only thrice, and each time with a laudatory"
4012,SECT. II.,epithet.
4013,SECT. II.,
4014,SECT. II.,"In Il. x. 429, where they form part of the Trojan camp, and again in"
4015,SECT. II.,"Od. xix. 177, where they are stated to be found in Crete, they are"
4016,SECT. II.,δῖοι. Homer never applies this word except to what is preeminent in its
4017,SECT. II.,"kind: in particular, he never attaches it to any national name besides"
4018,SECT. II.,"the Pelasgi, except Ἀχαιοὶ, which of itself amounts to a presumption"
4019,SECT. II.,that he regarded his countrymen as in some way standing in the same
4020,SECT. II.,class with the Pelasgians.
4021,SECT. II.,
4022,SECT. II.,"In the remaining passage where he names the Pelasgians, that in the"
4023,SECT. II.,"Trojan Catalogue (Il. ii. 340), he calls them ἐγχεσίμωροι. He uses this"
4024,SECT. II.,"epithet in only three other places. Of itself it is laudatory, because"
4025,SECT. II.,"it is connected with the proper work of heroes, the σταδίη ὑσμίνη."
4026,SECT. II.,In one of the three places he applies it individually to two royal
4027,SECT. II.,"warriors, one Munes the husband of Briseis, and the other Epistrophus"
4028,SECT. II.,"(Il. ii. 693), a warrior associated with Munes. In the second (Il. vii."
4029,SECT. II.,"134), he gives it to the Arcadians; whom in the Catalogue (ii. 611), he"
4030,SECT. II.,has already commended as ἐπιστάμενοι πολεμίζειν. In the third passage
4031,SECT. II.,"(Od. iii. 188), he applies the epithet to the Myrmidons themselves."
4032,SECT. II.,"From each of these uses, the last especially, we may draw fresh"
4033,SECT. II.,presumptions of his high estimate of the Pelasgian name.
4034,SECT. II.,
4035,SECT. II.,"V. Again. In the case of a race, unless when it can be traced to"
4036,SECT. II.,"an Eponymus or name-giver, the plural name precedes the singular"
4037,SECT. II.,"in common use. There must be Celts before there can be a Celt, and"
4038,SECT. II.,Pelasgians before there can be a Pelasgian. The use therefore of the
4039,SECT. II.,"singular, in the names of nations, is a proof of what is established"
4040,SECT. II.,and long familiar.
4041,SECT. II.,
4042,SECT. II.,"For example, Homer never calls a single Greek Δαναός, nor Ἀργεῖος"
4043,SECT. II.,(though in the particular cases of Juno and of Helen he uses the
4044,SECT. II.,"singular feminine, of which more hereafter), but only Ἀχαιός; and we"
4045,SECT. II.,"shall find, that this fact is not without its meaning. It is therefore"
4046,SECT. II.,"worthy of note, that he uses the term Πελασγὸς in the singular. The"
4047,SECT. II.,"chiefs of the Pelasgian ἐπίκουροι at Troy were Hippothous and Pulæus,"
4048,SECT. II.,"(Il. ii. 843,) who were"
4049,SECT. II.,
4050,SECT. II.,υἷε δύω Λήθοιο Πελασγοῦ Τευταμίδαο.
4051,SECT. II.,
4052,SECT. II.,"And again, (xvii. 288),"
4053,SECT. II.,
4054,SECT. II.,Λήθοιο Πελασγοῦ φαίδιμος υἷος.
4055,SECT. II.,
4056,SECT. II.,"‘The illustrious son of Lethus the Pelasgian.’ It seems uncertain, from"
4057,SECT. II.,"their place in the Trojan Catalogue, whether these Pelasgians were"
4058,SECT. II.,European or Asiatic; nor is it material to which region they belonged.
4059,SECT. II.,
4060,SECT. II.,_The Pelasgians and Larissa._
4061,SECT. II.,
4062,SECT. II.,"VI. It is further observable, that Homer implies distinctly the"
4063,SECT. II.,existence of various tribes of Pelasgi under that same name in various
4064,SECT. II.,"and widely separated places. He says,"
4065,SECT. II.,
4066,SECT. II.,Ἱππόθοος δ’ ἄγε φῦλα Πελασγῶν ἐγχεσιμώρων
4067,SECT. II.,"τῶν, οἱ Λαρίσσην ἐριβώλακα ναιετάουσιν."
4068,SECT. II.,
4069,SECT. II.,Strabo justly observes upon the use of the plural φῦλα in this passage
4070,SECT. II.,as implying considerable numbers. And the words τῶν οἱ in the
4071,SECT. II.,"following line, signifying “namely those Pelasgi, who,” show that the"
4072,SECT. II.,poet found it necessary to use a distinctive mark in order that these
4073,SECT. II.,"Pelasgi might not be confounded with other Pelasgi. Again, as this is"
4074,SECT. II.,"in the Trojan Catalogue, where as a matter of course no Greeks would"
4075,SECT. II.,"be found, he could hardly need to distinguish them from any Pelasgi"
4076,SECT. II.,"connected with the Greeks, and we may assume it as most probable that"
4077,SECT. II.,he meant thus to distinguish them from other Pelasgi out of Greece
4078,SECT. II.,"rather than in Greece. At the same time, he may have had regard to"
4079,SECT. II.,"other Pelasgians of Pelasgic Argos. In that country, as we may conclude"
4080,SECT. II.,"with confidence from the appellation itself, they were known to form"
4081,SECT. II.,"the bulk of the population, and as we hear of no such Pelasgian mass"
4082,SECT. II.,"elsewhere in Homer, he may possibly have had them particularly in his"
4083,SECT. II.,"mind, when he described the Trojan Pelasgians as Pelasgians of Larissa."
4084,SECT. II.,
4085,SECT. II.,Some light is also thrown upon the character and habits of nations
4086,SECT. II.,by the epithets attached to their places of abode. Homer mentions
4087,SECT. II.,"Larissa but twice: once here, and once where he relates the death of"
4088,SECT. II.,"Hippothous, τῆλ’ ἀπὸ Λαρίσσης ἐριβώλακος (Il. xvii. 301). The fertility"
4089,SECT. II.,"of Larissa tends, as far as it goes, to mark the Pelasgi as a people of"
4090,SECT. II.,"cultivators, having settled habits of life."
4091,SECT. II.,
4092,SECT. II.,"There is some difficulty, however, connected with the particular sign"
4093,SECT. II.,which Homer has employed to distinguish these Pelasgians. ‘Hippothous
4094,SECT. II.,"led the Pelasgi, those Pelasgi, I mean, who inhabit productive"
4095,SECT. II.,"Larissa.’ From this it would appear that in the days of Homer, though"
4096,SECT. II.,"there were many Pelasgi in various places, there was but one Larissa."
4097,SECT. II.,"And, accordingly, the name never appears within the Greece of Homer,"
4098,SECT. II.,"either in the Catalogue, or elsewhere. Yet tradition hands down to us"
4099,SECT. II.,"many Larissas, both in Greece and beyond it: and critics hold it to be"
4100,SECT. II.,"reasonably presumed, wherever we find a Larissa, that there Pelasgi had"
4101,SECT. II.,"been settled. But this name of Larissa apparently was not, and probably"
4102,SECT. II.,"could not have been, thus largely employed in Homer’s time; for if it"
4103,SECT. II.,"had been so, the poet’s use of the term Larissa would not have been"
4104,SECT. II.,"in this case what he meant it to be, namely, distinctive. Yet the"
4105,SECT. II.,"Pelasgians were even at that time apparently falling, or even fallen,"
4106,SECT. II.,into decay. How then could they have built many new cities in the
4107,SECT. II.,"subsequent ages? And, except in that way, how could the name Larissa"
4108,SECT. II.,"have revived, and acquired its peculiar significance?"
4109,SECT. II.,
4110,SECT. II.,In six places of the Iliad we hear of a particular part of the city of
4111,SECT. II.,"Troy which was built upon a height, and in which the temple of Apollo"
4112,SECT. II.,"was situated (v. 446). This affords us an example of a separate name,"
4113,SECT. II.,"Πέργαμος, affixed to a separate part of a city, that part apparently"
4114,SECT. II.,being the citadel. In like manner the citadel of Argos (which stood
4115,SECT. II.,"upon an eminence) had, at a later date, a distinct name, which was"
4116,SECT. II.,"Larissa[145], and was said to have been derived from a daughter of"
4117,SECT. II.,Pelasgus so called[146]. Now it may have been the general rule to
4118,SECT. II.,"call the citadels of the Pelasgian towns Larissa. If so, then we can"
4119,SECT. II.,"readily understand that so long as the towns themselves, or rather, it"
4120,SECT. II.,"might be, the scattered hamlets, remained, the name of the citadels"
4121,SECT. II.,"would be rarely heard: but when the former fell into decay, the solid"
4122,SECT. II.,"masonry which the Pelasgi used for walls and for public buildings,"
4123,SECT. II.,"but which did not extend to private dwellings, would remain. Thus the"
4124,SECT. II.,"citadels would naturally retain their own old name, which had been"
4125,SECT. II.,originally attached to them with reference to their fortifications.
4126,SECT. II.,This hypothesis will fully account for the absorption of the particular
4127,SECT. II.,and separate names of towns in the original and common name of their
4128,SECT. II.,citadels.
4129,SECT. II.,
4130,SECT. II.,"Where an agricultural settlement was made upon ground, some particular"
4131,SECT. II.,"spot of which afforded easy means of fortification, convenience would"
4132,SECT. II.,probably dictate the erection of a citadel for occasional retreat in
4133,SECT. II.,"time of danger, without any attempt to gather closely into one place"
4134,SECT. II.,and surround with walls the residences of the settlers: a measure
4135,SECT. II.,"which, as entailing many disadvantages, was only likely to take place"
4136,SECT. II.,under the pressure of strong necessity. Such I have presumed to have
4137,SECT. II.,"been the ordinary history of the Pelasgian Larissas. That which, while"
4138,SECT. II.,"it flourished as a Pelasgian settlement, might be an Argos[147], would,"
4139,SECT. II.,"perhaps, after a conquest, and the changes consequent upon it, become"
4140,SECT. II.,at last a Larissa.
4141,SECT. II.,
4142,SECT. II.,"But cases might arise in which the most fertile lands, lying entirely"
4143,SECT. II.,"open and level, would, on the one hand, offer peculiar temptations"
4144,SECT. II.,"to the spoiler, and, on the other, offer no scarped or elevated spot"
4145,SECT. II.,suitable for a separate fortification. In such a case the name ἐριβώλαξ
4146,SECT. II.,"would be best deserved, and in such a case too the probable result"
4147,SECT. II.,"would be, to build a walled town including all the habitations of the"
4148,SECT. II.,"colonists. This walled town would, for the very same reason as the"
4149,SECT. II.,"citadels elsewhere, be itself a Larissa: and thus this Pelasgian name"
4150,SECT. II.,"might be a distinctive one in the time of Homer, and yet might become a"
4151,SECT. II.,common one afterwards.
4152,SECT. II.,
4153,SECT. II.,"All this corresponds with the general belief on the two points, (1)"
4154,SECT. II.,"that the Pelasgians dwelt, as in Attica, κωμηδὸν, and (2) that the"
4155,SECT. II.,Larissas are Pelasgian.
4156,SECT. II.,
4157,SECT. II.,"But moreover it is supported by particular instances. Troy, for"
4158,SECT. II.,"example, had its Pergama on a lofty part of the site where it stood:"
4159,SECT. II.,"and from the epithets αἰπείνη, ὀφρυόεσσα, ἠνεμόεσσα, applied to the"
4160,SECT. II.,name Ἴλιος but never to Τροίη (of course I mean when this latter word
4161,SECT. II.,"is used for the city, the only class of cases in point), it may justly"
4162,SECT. II.,be inferred that Ilus[148] built the Pergama when he migrated into the
4163,SECT. II.,plain. But the wall surrounding the entire city was only built in the
4164,SECT. II.,"next generation, under King Laomedon, who employed Neptune and Apollo"
4165,SECT. II.,for the purpose.
4166,SECT. II.,
4167,SECT. II.,"Another, and perhaps more marked instance, is to be found in the case"
4168,SECT. II.,"of Thebes. We know from Thucydides[149] that Bœotia was, from its"
4169,SECT. II.,"openness and fertility, more liable to revolutions from successive"
4170,SECT. II.,occupancy than other parts of Greece. With this statement a passage
4171,SECT. II.,of the Odyssey[150] is in remarkable accordance. Homer tells us that
4172,SECT. II.,"Amphion and Zethus, probably among the very earliest Hellic immigrants"
4173,SECT. II.,"into Middle Greece, first settled on the site of Thebes; and, he adds"
4174,SECT. II.,"specially, that they fortified it. But apparently it could not have"
4175,SECT. II.,"been the usual practice of the time to surround entire cities, at"
4176,SECT. II.,"least, with fortifications, because he goes on to assign the special"
4177,SECT. II.,"reason for its being done in this case, namely, that, even powerful as"
4178,SECT. II.,"they were, they could not hold that country, so open (εὐρύχορος, Od."
4179,SECT. II.,"xi. 265) and rich, except with the aid of walls. This would appear to"
4180,SECT. II.,"be a case like the Λαρίσση ἐριβώλαξ of the seventeenth Iliad, and both"
4181,SECT. II.,alike were probably exceptions to the general rule.
4182,SECT. II.,
4183,SECT. II.,I have now done with the direct notices of the Pelasgi in Homer. But
4184,SECT. II.,we have still a considerable harvest of indirect notices to gather.
4185,SECT. II.,"Particularly, in discussing the meaning of the name Ionians, we shall"
4186,SECT. II.,hereafter find reason to suppose that Homer’s Athenians were Pelasgic:
4187,SECT. II.,and I propose here to refer to some similar indications with respect to
4188,SECT. II.,the Arcadians.
4189,SECT. II.,
4190,SECT. II.,
4191,SECT. II.,_The Arcadians in Homer._
4192,SECT. II.,
4193,SECT. II.,"Like the Pelasgians, the Arcadians are, as we have seen, happy in never"
4194,SECT. II.,being mentioned without Homer’s commendation. In Il. ii. 611 they are
4195,SECT. II.,ἐπιστάμενοι πολεμίζειν. In Il. vii. 134 they are ἐγχεσίμωροι.
4196,SECT. II.,
4197,SECT. II.,_The Arcadians Pelasgian._
4198,SECT. II.,
4199,SECT. II.,In the Catalogue he also throws some light upon the habits of the
4200,SECT. II.,"Arcadians: first, by describing them as heavy armed, ἀγχιμάχηται:"
4201,SECT. II.,"secondly, by stating that they had no care for maritime pursuits."
4202,SECT. II.,In both respects their relation to the Trojans is remarkable. With
4203,SECT. II.,"the exception of the Arcadians, the epithet ἀγχιμάχηται is nowhere"
4204,SECT. II.,"used except for the substantive Δάρδανοι, and the position of the"
4205,SECT. II.,Dardanians in Troas very much corresponded with that of the Arcadians
4206,SECT. II.,"in Greece. Again, the Trojans, as we know, were so entirely destitute"
4207,SECT. II.,"of ships, that Paris had to build them by way of special undertaking."
4208,SECT. II.,These resemblances tend to suggest a further likeness. As the Trojans
4209,SECT. II.,"appear to have been peculiarly given to the pursuits of peace, it is"
4210,SECT. II.,reasonable to suppose the poet had the same idea of the Arcadians. The
4211,SECT. II.,ἀγχιμάχηται is connected with the habits of settled cultivators. A
4212,SECT. II.,"peasantry furnishes heavy infantry, while light troops are best formed"
4213,SECT. II.,from a population of less settled habits and ruder manners. And as the
4214,SECT. II.,use of ships had much less to do with regular commerce than with piracy
4215,SECT. II.,"and war,[151] so the absence of maritime habits tends, for the heroic"
4216,SECT. II.,"age, to imply a pacific character. In those days the principal purpose"
4217,SECT. II.,of easy locomotion was booty: and there was no easy locomotion for
4218,SECT. II.,"bodies of men, except by ships. Though inclosed by hills, Arcadia was a"
4219,SECT. II.,"horse feeding[152], therefore relatively not a poor country. In later"
4220,SECT. II.,"times it was, next to Laconia[153], the most populous province of the"
4221,SECT. II.,"Peloponnesus; and even in Homer, although its political position was"
4222,SECT. II.,"evidently secondary, it supplied no less than sixty ships with large"
4223,SECT. II.,crews to each[154]. All this is favourable to the tradition which gives
4224,SECT. II.,it a Pelasgian character.
4225,SECT. II.,
4226,SECT. II.,"Again, the Arcadians were commanded by Agapenor the son of Ancæus[155]."
4227,SECT. II.,He would appear not to have been an indigenous sovereign. For we
4228,SECT. II.,"learn from a speech of Nestor in the twenty-third Book[156], that"
4229,SECT. II.,"games were celebrated at the burial of Amarynceus by the Epeans, in"
4230,SECT. II.,which he himself overcame in wrestling Ancæus the Pleuronian. Ancæus
4231,SECT. II.,therefore was not an Arcadian but an Ætolian: and his son Agapenor was
4232,SECT. II.,"probably either the first Arcadian of his race, or else a stranger"
4233,SECT. II.,appointed by Agamemnon to command the Arcadians in the Trojan war.
4234,SECT. II.,"Their having ships from Agamemnon, and a chief either foreign or of"
4235,SECT. II.,"non-Arcadian extraction, are facts which tend to mark the Arcadians as"
4236,SECT. II.,"politically dependent, and therefore _pro tanto_ as Pelasgian: for it"
4237,SECT. II.,cannot be doubted that whatever in Greece was Pelasgian at the epoch
4238,SECT. II.,"of the _Troica_, was also subordinate to some race of higher and more"
4239,SECT. II.,effective energies.
4240,SECT. II.,
4241,SECT. II.,Again. It will hereafter (I think) be found that the institution of
4242,SECT. II.,all gymnastic and martial games was Hellenic and not Pelasgic[157].
4243,SECT. II.,"In the passage last quoted there is a very remarkable statement, that"
4244,SECT. II.,"there were present at the games Epeans, Pylians, and Ætolians: that is"
4245,SECT. II.,"to say, all the neighbouring tribes, except the Arcadians. Thus we have"
4246,SECT. II.,a strong presumption established that these games were not congenial
4247,SECT. II.,to Arcadian habits: and if the same can be shown from other sources
4248,SECT. II.,"with respect to the Pelasgians, there is a strong presumption that the"
4249,SECT. II.,Arcadians were themselves Pelasgian.
4250,SECT. II.,
4251,SECT. II.,"Once more. In the sixth book Nestor relates, that in his youth the"
4252,SECT. II.,Pylians and Arcadians fought near the town of Pheiæ and the river
4253,SECT. II.,"Iardanos. The Arcadians were commanded by Ereuthalion, who wore the"
4254,SECT. II.,armour of Areithous. Areithous had met his death by stratagem from
4255,SECT. II.,"Lycoorgos, who appropriated the armour, and bequeathed it to his"
4256,SECT. II.,"θεραπών, or companion in arms, Ereuthalion. Nestor, on the part of the"
4257,SECT. II.,"Pylians, encountered Ereuthalion, and by the aid of Minerva defeated"
4258,SECT. II.,him.
4259,SECT. II.,
4260,SECT. II.,"From this tale it would appear, first, that Lycoorgus was king of"
4261,SECT. II.,"Arcadia. His name savours of Pelasgian origin, from its relation to"
4262,SECT. II.,"Λυκαών of the later tradition respecting Arcadia, and to Lycaon son"
4263,SECT. II.,"of Priam, descended by the mother’s side from the Leleges; again, to"
4264,SECT. II.,Lycaon the father of Pandarus; possibly also to the inhabitants of
4265,SECT. II.,"Lycia. The allusion to his having succeeded by stratagem only, is very"
4266,SECT. II.,"pointed (148),"
4267,SECT. II.,
4268,SECT. II.,"τὸν Λυκόοργος ἔπεφνε δόλῳ, οὔτι κράτεΐ γε,"
4269,SECT. II.,
4270,SECT. II.,and the terms employed appear to indicate a military inferiority: which
4271,SECT. II.,"accords with the probable relation of the Arcadians, as Pelasgi, to"
4272,SECT. II.,their Hellenic neighbours. And this again corresponds with the close
4273,SECT. II.,"of the story; in which Nestor, fighting on the part of the Pylians who"
4274,SECT. II.,"were Achæan, and therefore Hellenic, conquers the Arcadian chieftain"
4275,SECT. II.,Ereuthalion (Il. vi. 132-56).
4276,SECT. II.,
4277,SECT. II.,"It may be remarked once for all, that this military inferiority is not"
4278,SECT. II.,"to be understood as if the Pelasgi were cowards, but simply as implying"
4279,SECT. II.,that they gave way before tribes of more marked military genius or
4280,SECT. II.,habits than themselves; as at Hastings the Saxons did before the
4281,SECT. II.,Normans; or as the Russians did in the late war of 1854-6 before the
4282,SECT. II.,Western armies.
4283,SECT. II.,
4284,SECT. II.,"Lastly, the δῖος applied to Ereuthalion (Il. v. 319), accords with the"
4285,SECT. II.,use of that epithet for the Pelasgi elsewhere.
4286,SECT. II.,
4287,SECT. II.,"Thus a number of indications from Homer, slight when taken separately,"
4288,SECT. II.,"but more considerable when combined, and drawn from _all_ the passages"
4289,SECT. II.,"in which Homer refers to Arcadia, converge upon the supposition that"
4290,SECT. II.,the Arcadians were a Pelasgian people.
4291,SECT. II.,
4292,SECT. II.,They are supported by the whole stream of later tradition; which placed
4293,SECT. II.,"Lycaon, son of Pelasgus, in Arcadia, which uniformly represented the"
4294,SECT. II.,"Arcadians as autochthonic[158], and which made them competitors with"
4295,SECT. II.,the Argives for the honour of having given to the Pelasgians their
4296,SECT. II.,original seat in the Peloponnesus.
4297,SECT. II.,
4298,SECT. II.,"Here too philology steps in, and lends us some small aid. The name"
4299,SECT. II.,"of Προσέληνοι, which the Arcadians took to themselves, and which is"
4300,SECT. II.,"assumed to mean older than the moon, appears, when so understood, to"
4301,SECT. II.,express a very forced idea: it is difficult indeed to conceive how
4302,SECT. II.,such a name could even creep into use. But if we refer its origin to
4303,SECT. II.,"πρὸ and Σελλοὶ or Σέλληνες, it then becomes the simple indication of"
4304,SECT. II.,"the historical fact we are looking for, namely, that they, a Pelasgic"
4305,SECT. II.,"population, occupied Arcadia before any of the Hellic or Sellic races"
4306,SECT. II.,had come into the Peloponnesus.
4307,SECT. II.,
4308,SECT. II.,"From its rich pastures, Arcadia was originally well adapted for"
4309,SECT. II.,"Pelasgian inhabitants. Defended by mountains, it offered, as Attica"
4310,SECT. II.,"did through the poverty of its soil, an asylum to the refugees of that"
4311,SECT. II.,"race, when dispossessed from other still more fertile, and perhaps also"
4312,SECT. II.,more accessible tracts of the Peloponnesus[159]. Hence it is easy to
4313,SECT. II.,"account both for its original Pelasgian character, and for the long"
4314,SECT. II.,retention of it.
4315,SECT. II.,
4316,SECT. II.,We seem then to find the Arcadians of Homer (first) politically
4317,SECT. II.,"dependent, and (secondly) commanded by a foreigner, but yet (thirdly)"
4318,SECT. II.,valiant in war. It would thus appear that what they wanted was not
4319,SECT. II.,"animal or even moral courage, but the political and governing element,"
4320,SECT. II.,which is the main element in high martial talent. All this we shall
4321,SECT. II.,"find, as we already have in some degree found, to be a Pelasgian"
4322,SECT. II.,portraiture. And if it should seem to have been drawn with the aid of
4323,SECT. II.,"conjecture, let it at any rate be observed that it is supported by"
4324,SECT. II.,the Arcadian character in the historic ages. They appear from various
4325,SECT. II.,indications to have been for many generations the Swiss of Greece:
4326,SECT. II.,"not producing great commanders, and obscure enough, until a very late"
4327,SECT. II.,"date, in the political annals of the country, but abounding in the"
4328,SECT. II.,"materials of a hardy soldiery, and taking service with this or that"
4329,SECT. II.,section of the Greeks as chance might dictate. For in Xenophon they
4330,SECT. II.,boast that when any of the Greeks wanted auxiliaries (ἐπίκουροι) they
4331,SECT. II.,came to Arcadia to obtain them: that the Lacedæmonians took them into
4332,SECT. II.,"company when they invaded Attica, and that the Thebans did the very"
4333,SECT. II.,"same when they invaded Lacedæmon[160]. And Thucydides tells us that,"
4334,SECT. II.,"in the Sicilian war, the Mantineans, with a portion of their brother"
4335,SECT. II.,"Arcadians, fought for hire with the Athenians on one side, while"
4336,SECT. II.,"another contingent from the very same State assisted the Corinthians,"
4337,SECT. II.,who had come in force to aid in the defence of Syracuse against
4338,SECT. II.,them[161].
4339,SECT. II.,
4340,SECT. II.,_The Graians: the Pelasgians and Ceres._
4341,SECT. II.,
4342,SECT. II.,"Two other circumstances, slight in themselves, still remain for notice."
4343,SECT. II.,
4344,SECT. II.,1. It was through the authority and practice of the Romans that the
4345,SECT. II.,name of Greeks or Graians came ultimately to supplant that of Hellenes.
4346,SECT. II.,"Out of this fact, which is the most important piece of evidence in our"
4347,SECT. II.,"possession, arises the presumption, that as it was the Pelasgians who"
4348,SECT. II.,"may be said to have supplied the main link between Greece and Italy,"
4349,SECT. II.,"and between the Hellenic and the Roman language, the Graians could not"
4350,SECT. II.,but have been a branch or portion of that people. Now we know that the
4351,SECT. II.,"Pelasgians were cultivators of the plains. Bœotia is, as we have seen,"
4352,SECT. II.,"indicated by Thucydides[162] as the richest plain[163] of Greece, and"
4353,SECT. II.,on that account among the parts most liable to the displacement of
4354,SECT. II.,their inhabitants. It was therefore probably a plain where the Pelasgi
4355,SECT. II.,"would have settled early and in numbers: and it deserves notice, that"
4356,SECT. II.,"the Catalogue[164] placing the town of Graia in Bœotia, places it where"
4357,SECT. II.,"we naturally assume a large, though now, as in Thessaly, subordinate"
4358,SECT. II.,Pelasgian population to have existed.
4359,SECT. II.,
4360,SECT. II.,Nor is the passage in which Aristotle notices the Γραικοὶ adverse
4361,SECT. II.,to the belief that they were a Pelasgian race. He states that the
4362,SECT. II.,deluge of Deucalion was in the ancient Hellas: which is the country
4363,SECT. II.,reaching from Dodona to the Achelous (αὕτη δ’ ἐστὶν ἡ περὶ τὴν Δωδώνην
4364,SECT. II.,"καὶ τὸν Ἀχελῷον). This may include either great part, or the whole,"
4365,SECT. II.,of Thessaly: whether we understand it of the little and Thessalian
4366,SECT. II.,"Achelous, near Lamia, which was within thirty _stadia_ of the"
4367,SECT. II.,"Spercheus[165]: or of the great Achelous, which skirted the western"
4368,SECT. II.,"border of that country, and whose line of tributaries was fed from the"
4369,SECT. II.,"slopes of Pindus. If we understand the Dodona of Epirus, this will give"
4370,SECT. II.,"a considerable range of country, all of it outside Thessaly. Aristotle"
4371,SECT. II.,"proceeds to say, that there dwelt the Selli, and those then called"
4372,SECT. II.,Γραικοὶ but now Hellenes (καὶ οἱ καλούμενοι τότε μὲν Γραικοὶ νῦν δὲ
4373,SECT. II.,"Ἕλληνες). Thus he describes as Γραικοὶ those who, together with the"
4374,SECT. II.,"Selli, were the inhabitants of the country that Homer calls Pelasgic"
4375,SECT. II.,Argos: so that according to him the Γραικοὶ were not Sellic: and the
4376,SECT. II.,"time, when they were thus neighbours of the Selli, was the pre-Hellenic"
4377,SECT. II.,time. This is nearly equivalent to an assertion by Aristotle that the
4378,SECT. II.,"Graians were Pelasgic, for we know of no other pre-Hellenic race in"
4379,SECT. II.,Thessaly[166].
4380,SECT. II.,
4381,SECT. II.,"2. In vv. 695, 6 we find that (Πύρασος) Pyrasus in Thessaly (probably"
4382,SECT. II.,"deriving its name from πυρὸς wheat, grain), is described as Δήμητρος"
4383,SECT. II.,τέμενος: and it is the only ground consecrated to Ceres that Homer
4384,SECT. II.,"mentions. It is material that this should be in Thessaly, the"
4385,SECT. II.,"especially Pelasgic country: for both slight notices in Homer, and"
4386,SECT. II.,"much of later tradition, connect the Pelasgi in a peculiar manner with"
4387,SECT. II.,"the worship of that deity. For example, Pausanias mentions a temple of"
4388,SECT. II.,Δημήτηρ Πελασγὶς[167] at Corinth even in his own time. This connection
4389,SECT. II.,in its turn serves to confirm the character of the Pelasgi as a rural
4390,SECT. II.,and agricultural people.
4391,SECT. II.,
4392,SECT. II.,"So far as this part of the evidence of Homer is concerned, it goes to"
4393,SECT. II.,"this only, that with the aid of Hesiod it serves to exhibit Ceres in"
4394,SECT. II.,"direct relations with two countries; both with Thessaly, and, as will"
4395,SECT. II.,"now be shown, with Crete; in which also, as we know from Homer (brought"
4396,SECT. II.,"down by Hesiod to a later date), the Pelasgian name still remained when"
4397,SECT. II.,it had apparently been submerged elsewhere in Greece; and in which
4398,SECT. II.,therefore it may be inferred that the Pelasgian element was more than
4399,SECT. II.,usually strong and durable.
4400,SECT. II.,
4401,SECT. II.,In the fifth Odyssey[168] we are told that Ceres fell in love with a
4402,SECT. II.,"son of Iasus (Iasion, in Hesiod Iasios), whom she met νειῷ ἐνὶ τριπόλῳ;"
4403,SECT. II.,"in what country Homer does not say, but Hesiod, repeating the story,"
4404,SECT. II.,"adds it was in Crete, Κρήτης ἐν πίονι δήμῳ[169]. Thus the double"
4405,SECT. II.,connection is made good.
4406,SECT. II.,
4407,SECT. II.,"Over and above this, the name Iasus goes of itself to establish a"
4408,SECT. II.,Pelasgian origin.
4409,SECT. II.,
4410,SECT. II.,"1. Because Ἴασον Ἄργος is an old name for the Peloponnesus, or else"
4411,SECT. II.,"a large portion of it; whereas the Hellenic name was, as we know,"
4412,SECT. II.,Ἀχαικὸν Ἄργος. And the Ἰασίδαι reigned in Orchomenus[170] two or three
4413,SECT. II.,generations before the Neleids. This probably touches a period when
4414,SECT. II.,"no Hellic tribes had, as far as we know, found their way into the"
4415,SECT. II.,"Peloponnesus[171], and when the dynasties even of the middle and north"
4416,SECT. II.,"were, as is probable, chiefly Pelasgian."
4417,SECT. II.,
4418,SECT. II.,"2. Because Ἴασος[172] was the name of one of the Athenian leaders, and"
4419,SECT. II.,"the Athenians were, as we shall find, manifestly Pelasgian. His father"
4420,SECT. II.,"Sphelus is also the son of Boucolus, a name which will be shown to be"
4421,SECT. II.,of Pelasgic and not Hellenic character[173].
4422,SECT. II.,
4423,SECT. II.,3. Because Dmetor the son of Iasus was the ruler of Cyprus at the
4424,SECT. II.,"epoch of the Troica, and that island seems to have stood in an"
4425,SECT. II.,"anomalous relation of half-dependence to Agamemnon, which is best"
4426,SECT. II.,capable of explanation if we suppose it to have been inhabited by a
4427,SECT. II.,population still retaining its Pelasgian character. To this question I
4428,SECT. II.,shall shortly have occasion to return in a more full consideration of
4429,SECT. II.,the case of Cyprus.
4430,SECT. II.,
4431,SECT. II.,"Of later tradition, there is abundance to connect Ceres with the"
4432,SECT. II.,"Pelasgians: their character as tillers of the soil, and hers as the"
4433,SECT. II.,"giver of grain: the worship of her at Eleusis, dating from time"
4434,SECT. II.,"immemorial, and purporting to be founded upon rites different from"
4435,SECT. II.,those in vogue at a later epoch: this too taken in connection with the
4436,SECT. II.,"Pelasgian origin of Athens, and its long retention of that character."
4437,SECT. II.,"In the ancient hymn to Ceres, estranged from Jupiter and the other"
4438,SECT. II.,"gods, she comes to Eleusis, and there herself founds the worship; and"
4439,SECT. II.,she announces in her tale that she was come from Crete:
4440,SECT. II.,
4441,SECT. II.,"νῦν αὖτε Κρήτηθεν, ἐπ’ εὐρέα νῶτα θαλάσσης,"
4442,SECT. II.,"ἤλυθον, οὐκ ἐθέλουσα[174]."
4443,SECT. II.,
4444,SECT. II.,I even venture to suggest it as possible that the existence of a
4445,SECT. II.,"τέμενος (or land devoted to the service of any deity) at all, affords"
4446,SECT. II.,a presumption of a Pelasgic population and institutions. For we find
4447,SECT. II.,only three other cases of such endowments: all in places strongly
4448,SECT. II.,marked with a Pelasgic character. One is that of the river Sperchius
4449,SECT. II.,in Thessaly: a second that of Venus in Cyprus; and the third that of
4450,SECT. II.,Jupiter in Gargarus[175].
4451,SECT. II.,
4452,SECT. II.,
4453,SECT. II.,_The Ionians._
4454,SECT. II.,
4455,SECT. II.,The notices of the Ionians contained in Homer are faint and few: but
4456,SECT. II.,they are in entire contradiction with the prevailing tradition.
4457,SECT. II.,
4458,SECT. II.,"The word Ἰάονες occurs only once in the poems, where we find the five"
4459,SECT. II.,"contingents of Bœotians, Ionians, Locrians, Phthians, and Epeans,"
4460,SECT. II.,"united in resisting, but ineffectually, Hector’s attack upon the"
4461,SECT. II.,"ships. They are here termed ἑλκεχίτωνες[176], an epithet which is"
4462,SECT. II.,unfortunately nowhere else employed by the poet. The order in which
4463,SECT. II.,"they are named is,"
4464,SECT. II.,
4465,SECT. II.,"1. Bœotians,"
4466,SECT. II.,"2. Ionians,"
4467,SECT. II.,"3. Locrians,"
4468,SECT. II.,"4. Phthians,"
4469,SECT. II.,5. Epeans.
4470,SECT. II.,
4471,SECT. II.,"A description thus commences in three parts, of which the first is"
4472,SECT. II.,"(689-91),"
4473,SECT. II.,
4474,SECT. II.,οἱ μὲν Ἀθηναίων προλελεγμένοι· ἐν δ’ ἄρα τοῖσιν
4475,SECT. II.,"ἦρχ’ υἷος Πετεῶο, Μενεσθεύς· οἱ δ’ ἅμ’ ἕποντο"
4476,SECT. II.,"Φείδας τε Στιχίος τε, Βίας τ’ ἐΰς·"
4477,SECT. II.,
4478,SECT. II.,The second describes the leaders of the Epeans: the third of the
4479,SECT. II.,"Phthians, and these, it says, meaning apparently the Phthian force,"
4480,SECT. II.,"fought in conjunction with the Bœotians, μετὰ Βοιωτῶν ἐμάχοντο"
4481,SECT. II.,"(700). No Bœotian leaders are named: the absence of Oilean Ajax, who"
4482,SECT. II.,"officially led the Locrians, is immediately accounted for by saying"
4483,SECT. II.,"that he was with his inseparable friend, the Telamonian chief."
4484,SECT. II.,
4485,SECT. II.,"These Ἰάονες ἑλκεχίτωνες then were the προλελεγμένοι, a chosen band"
4486,SECT. II.,of the Athenian force; or else they were the force composed of men
4487,SECT. II.,picked among the Athenians. But no distinguished quality or act of
4488,SECT. II.,"war is recounted of the Athenians, either here or elsewhere in the"
4489,SECT. II.,"Iliad. They are simply called μηστῶρες ἀüτῆς,[177] but this is a mere"
4490,SECT. II.,"general epithet, has no reference to any particular conduct, and is not"
4491,SECT. II.,sustained by any relation of their feats in arms. The five divisions
4492,SECT. II.,above named fight in order to be beaten by the Trojans: and we may be
4493,SECT. II.,sure that Homer does not produce the flower of the Greeks for such a
4494,SECT. II.,purpose. Nor has the Athenian chief Menestheus any distinction whatever
4495,SECT. II.,"accorded to him, even in the much questioned passage of the Catalogue,"
4496,SECT. II.,except that of being excellent at marshalling forces.
4497,SECT. II.,
4498,SECT. II.,_The Athenians in the Catalogue._
4499,SECT. II.,
4500,SECT. II.,"The passage Il. ii. 546-56, describing the Athenians in the Catalogue,"
4501,SECT. II.,is of so much historical interest through the various points it
4502,SECT. II.,"involves, as to deserve a particular consideration, which it may"
4503,SECT. II.,best receive in this place. Upon it depends some part of the Homeric
4504,SECT. II.,evidence relating to the signs of a Pelasgian origin.
4505,SECT. II.,
4506,SECT. II.,"Three lines of it must in any case be allowed to remain, in order to"
4507,SECT. II.,describe the Athenian contingent and its commander.
4508,SECT. II.,
4509,SECT. II.,"οἱ δ’ ἄρ’ Ἀθήνας εἶχον, ἐϋκτίμενον πτολίεθρον ... (v. 546.)"

4512,SECT. II.,
4513,SECT. II.,τῷ δ’ ἅμα πεντήκοντα μέλαιναι νῆες ἕποντο. (556.)
4514,SECT. II.,
4515,SECT. II.,To the supposition that this jejune _minimum_ represents the passage
4516,SECT. II.,"in its original form, it is certainly an objection, that in no other"
4517,SECT. II.,place of the whole Catalogue has Homer dispatched quite so drily and
4518,SECT. II.,summarily any important division of the force.
4519,SECT. II.,
4520,SECT. II.,"The remainder of the passage falls into three portions, of which the"
4521,SECT. II.,"first is separable from the two others, and the first with the second"
4522,SECT. II.,is also separable from the third. They are as follows:
4523,SECT. II.,
4524,SECT. II.,(1)--vv. 546-9.
4525,SECT. II.,
4526,SECT. II.,"οἱ δ’ ἄρ’ Ἀθήνας εἶχον, ἐϋκτίμενον πτολίεθρον,"
4527,SECT. II.,"δῆμον Ἐρεχθῆος μεγαλήτορος, ὅν ποτ’ Ἀθήνη"
4528,SECT. II.,"θρέψε Διὸς θυγάτηρ, τέκε δὲ ζείδωρος Ἄρουρα,"
4529,SECT. II.,"κὰδ δ’ ἐν Ἀθήνῃσ’ εἷσεν, ἑῷ ἐνὶ πίονι νηῷ."
4530,SECT. II.,
4531,SECT. II.,There is a reading of Ἀθήνης for Ἀθηνῃσ’: it is disputed whether τέκε
4532,SECT. II.,applies to δῆμον or to Erechtheus; whether ἑῷ is to be understood of
4533,SECT. II.,"Erechtheus or of Minerva; and again, what is the meaning of πίονι as"
4534,SECT. II.,applied to νηῷ? The variety of lection is not material: the application
4535,SECT. II.,"of τέκε is clearly to Erechtheus, as seems also that of ἑῷ to"
4536,SECT. II.,"Minerva[178]. Again, the application of the epithet πίονι to the temple"
4537,SECT. II.,"is perhaps sufficiently supported by Od. xii. 346, πίονα νηὸν, and Il."
4538,SECT. II.,"v. 512, μάλα πίονος ἐξ ἀδύτοιο."
4539,SECT. II.,
4540,SECT. II.,"It does not appear that these lines, or the two which follow, were"
4541,SECT. II.,"rejected by the Alexandrian critics, but the Pseudo-Herodotus, in the"
4542,SECT. II.,"Life of Homer, c. 28, states that they were interpolated."
4543,SECT. II.,
4544,SECT. II.,The objections from internal evidence are stated by Payne Knight[179].
4545,SECT. II.,
4546,SECT. II.,1. That the Greeks had no temples at the time of the _Troica_.
4547,SECT. II.,
4548,SECT. II.,"2. That as Ἄρουρα is _superficies non orbis Terræ_, so it was not a"
4549,SECT. II.,known personification at the time of Homer.
4550,SECT. II.,
4551,SECT. II.,"As to the first of these, we hear of Trojan temples in the Iliad;"
4552,SECT. II.,probably also of the Greek temple of Apollo in Il. ix. 404; and of
4553,SECT. II.,"Greek temples in the Odyssey, beyond all reasonable doubt. We hear"
4554,SECT. II.,of Ætolian priests in Il. ix. 575; while it is not likely that there
4555,SECT. II.,should have been priests without temples.
4556,SECT. II.,
4557,SECT. II.,"Again, the circumstances of the Greeks in the Iliad were not such as to"
4558,SECT. II.,lead to the mention of temples usually or frequently. Therefore this is
4559,SECT. II.,not a ground of suspicion against the passage.
4560,SECT. II.,
4561,SECT. II.,"As to the second objection, it should be borne in mind that the"
4562,SECT. II.,"Earth, Γαῖα, as well as Ἄρουρα, was apparently to Homer, not less"
4563,SECT. II.,"than to the other ancients, a surface, not a solid (κυκλοτερὴς ὡς ἀπὸ"
4564,SECT. II.,"τόρνου, Herod. iv. 36.) The objection really is, that Ἄρουρα means a"
4565,SECT. II.,"particular class of ground, namely, arable or cultivable land; and that"
4566,SECT. II.,"to personify this class of land by itself is artificial, far-fetched,"
4567,SECT. II.,and not in the manner of Homer.
4568,SECT. II.,
4569,SECT. II.,"To me it appears clear that it would be unnatural for us, but very"
4570,SECT. II.,doubtful whether it was so for Homer. We could not in poetry well
4571,SECT. II.,treat Corn-field or Garden as a person: but the corn-bearing Earth
4572,SECT. II.,(ζείδωρος Ἄρουρα) had for the Greeks in their early days a vividness of
4573,SECT. II.,"meaning, which it has not for us. To us, to the modern European mind,"
4574,SECT. II.,the gifts of Ceres are but one item in an interminable list of things
4575,SECT. II.,"enjoyable and enjoyed: to man when yet youthful, while in his first"
4576,SECT. II.,"ruder contact with his mother Earth and the elements, while possessed"
4577,SECT. II.,"of few instruments and no resources, this idea was as determinate, as"
4578,SECT. II.,it was likewise suggestive and poetical. The Latins have no word by
4579,SECT. II.,"which to render the word Ἄρουρα in its full meaning, though _arvum_"
4580,SECT. II.,"must have been taken from it, or from the same root with it. It nearly"
4581,SECT. II.,corresponds with the English ‘glebe’ in its proper use[180]. It
4582,SECT. II.,"signifies not only corn land, but all productive land, for instance,"
4583,SECT. II.,"vine land, in Il. iii. 246. But to them, so pregnant was the idea,"
4584,SECT. II.,"that besides a crop of epithets such as πολύφορβος and τραφέρη, it"
4585,SECT. II.,"threw off its own inverted image in the epithet, habitual with Homer,"
4586,SECT. II.,"of ἀτρύγετος for θάλασσα, the un-cornbearing sea. Now when the idea"
4587,SECT. II.,"of corn land had been thus vividly conceived, the next step, that of"
4588,SECT. II.,"viewing Ἄρουρα as Γαῖα, was one not very hard to take. The objection"
4589,SECT. II.,seems to arise out of our unconsciously reading Homer in the false
4590,SECT. II.,light of our own familiar associations.
4591,SECT. II.,
4592,SECT. II.,His text affords evidence in support of these views. May it not be
4593,SECT. II.,said that the phrase πάτρις Ἄρουρα[181] for _patria_ shows us a great
4594,SECT. II.,"step towards personification? In the Νεκυία (Od. xi. 489), ἐπάρουρος"
4595,SECT. II.,"is equivalent to ‘alive;’ compare Il. xvii. 447. Again, Ulysses,"
4596,SECT. II.,"the moment he escapes from the river mouth to the shore, kisses the"
4597,SECT. II.,ζείδωρος Ἄρουρα[182] among the reeds: which seems to show an use of the
4598,SECT. II.,"term nearly synonymous with Γαῖα or earth. And again, praying for the"
4599,SECT. II.,"glory of Alcinous[183], he says,"
4600,SECT. II.,
4601,SECT. II.,τοῦ μέν κεν ἐπὶ ζείδωρον ἄρουραν
4602,SECT. II.,ἄσβεστον κλέος εἴη.
4603,SECT. II.,
4604,SECT. II.,The fame of Alcinous could not be confined to fields. So the setting
4605,SECT. II.,sun casts shadows on the ἐρίβωλος Ἄρουρα[184]. In both cases the
4606,SECT. II.,"term so approximates to the meaning of Earth, doubtless by metonymy,"
4607,SECT. II.,"as to be indistinguishable from it. Again Il. iv. 174, σέο δ’ ὄστεα"
4608,SECT. II.,"πύσει Ἄρουρα. Surely the meaning here is Earth, for we are not to"
4609,SECT. II.,suppose Homer meant to say the bodies of his warriors would lie on
4610,SECT. II.,the cultivable land only. But another passage brings us up to actual
4611,SECT. II.,"personification, that respecting Otus and Ephialtes"
4612,SECT. II.,
4613,SECT. II.,οὓς δὴ μηκίστους θρέψε ζείδωρος Ἄρουρα[185].
4614,SECT. II.,
4615,SECT. II.,This objection to Ἄρουρα therefore will not hold good: and the passage
4616,SECT. II.,"cannot be condemned upon internal evidence. It is referred to by Plato,"
4617,SECT. II.,in the first Alcibiades[186].
4618,SECT. II.,
4619,SECT. II.,"(2)--Vss. 550, 1."
4620,SECT. II.,
4621,SECT. II.,ἐνθάδε μιν ταύροισι καὶ ἀρνείοις ἱλάονται
4622,SECT. II.,"κοῦροι Ἀθηναίων, περιτελλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν."
4623,SECT. II.,
4624,SECT. II.,"Some refer μιν to Minerva, and construe the passage with reference to"
4625,SECT. II.,"the Panathenaic celebration. When so interpreted, as it is contended,"
4626,SECT. II.,the words betray a palpable anachronism.
4627,SECT. II.,
4628,SECT. II.,"Again it is alleged, (1) Homer does not in the Catalogue introduce"
4629,SECT. II.,"general descriptions of the religious rites of Greece, and it is"
4630,SECT. II.,"scarcely likely he should mention here a celebration, which he does not"
4631,SECT. II.,report to have had anything peculiar in its character. (2) From xi.
4632,SECT. II.,"729 it appears that cows were sacrificed to Minerva, not bulls: (3)"
4633,SECT. II.,"the tenour of the sentence directs us to Erechtheus, and it involves"
4634,SECT. II.,worship offered to a local hero.
4635,SECT. II.,
4636,SECT. II.,"With respect to the Panathenaica, a difficulty would undoubtedly"
4637,SECT. II.,"arise, if we were obliged to suppose that it contained a reference to"
4638,SECT. II.,"gymnastic games, which we have every reason to treat as having borne in"
4639,SECT. II.,the age of Homer a marked Hellenic character[187]. But the words imply
4640,SECT. II.,"no such reference. They speak, at the most, of no more than periodical"
4641,SECT. II.,"sacrifices. This implies an established festival, and nothing beyond"
4642,SECT. II.,it. Now such a signification raises no presumption whatever against
4643,SECT. II.,the genuineness of the passage: because we have one distinct and
4644,SECT. II.,"unquestionable case in Homer of an established festival of a deity,"
4645,SECT. II.,that namely of Apollo in the Odyssey. The day of the vengeance of
4646,SECT. II.,Ulysses was the ἑορτὴ τοῖο Θεοῖο ἁγνή[188].
4647,SECT. II.,
4648,SECT. II.,"So considering the passage, let us next examine the objection taken"
4649,SECT. II.,"to it, that it involves hero-worship[189], which was not known in the"
4650,SECT. II.,Homeric age.
4651,SECT. II.,
4652,SECT. II.,"Now we have in the Odyssey, as well as here in the Iliad, cases of"
4653,SECT. II.,mortals translated to heaven and to the company of immortals.
4654,SECT. II.,
4655,SECT. II.,"In the Odyssey we have, for example, the case of Castor and Pollux,"
4656,SECT. II.,"who enjoyed a peculiar privilege of life after death, and revisited"
4657,SECT. II.,"earth in some mysterious manner on alternate days[190]. And this, too,"
4658,SECT. II.,although they were buried[191].
4659,SECT. II.,
4660,SECT. II.,"Their τίμη πρὸς Ζηνὸς was such that, as the passage in Od. xi. proceeds"
4661,SECT. II.,"to state, they vied with deities;"
4662,SECT. II.,
4663,SECT. II.,τίμην δὲ λελόγχασ’ ἶσα θεοῖσιν.
4664,SECT. II.,
4665,SECT. II.,"This τίμη must have included honour paid on earth: to be in heaven,"
4666,SECT. II.,"unless in connection with earth and its inhabitants, was not of"
4667,SECT. II.,"itself a τίμη, much less was it the τίμη of the gods. The subject"
4668,SECT. II.,of hero-worship will be further examined in a later portion of this
4669,SECT. II.,"work: but for the present it appears sufficiently, that this comes"
4670,SECT. II.,near to hero-worship. The passage about Erechtheus is no more than a
4671,SECT. II.,"development of the expression relating to the Tyndarid brothers; and,"
4672,SECT. II.,"though by some steps in advance of it, can hardly be rejected on this"
4673,SECT. II.,ground alone as spurious. All passages cannot be expected to express
4674,SECT. II.,with precisely the same degree of fulness the essential ideas on which
4675,SECT. II.,"they are founded; and we are not entitled to cut off, on that ground"
4676,SECT. II.,"alone, the one which happens to be most in advance."
4677,SECT. II.,
4678,SECT. II.,But although the application to Erechtheus might not convict the
4679,SECT. II.,"passage, I very much question whether we ought so to apply it. It is"
4680,SECT. II.,"quite against the general bearing of the passage, which would much"
4681,SECT. II.,more naturally refer it to Minerva. The reason for it is that cows or
4682,SECT. II.,"heifers were offered to her, and not rams or bulls. No doubt, in the"
4683,SECT. II.,"particular cases mentioned to us, (Il. vi. 94, x. 292, xi. 729, and Od."
4684,SECT. II.,"iii. 382,) cows or heifers only are spoken of. But in Od. iii. 145 we"
4685,SECT. II.,"are told that ἑκατομβαὶ were to be offered to her, which we can hardly"
4686,SECT. II.,limit so rigidly: and considering that the cases of cows mentioned by
4687,SECT. II.,"Homer are all special, while this passage speaks of what was ordinary"
4688,SECT. II.,"and periodical, I think we should pause before admitting that the"
4689,SECT. II.,application of the lines to Minerva is on this ground indefensible.
4690,SECT. II.,
4691,SECT. II.,"The word περιτελλομένων[192] is taken to mean not annual revolutions,"
4692,SECT. II.,but the revolutions of periods of years. I question the grounds of this
4693,SECT. II.,"interpretation: but, if it could be established, it would certainly"
4694,SECT. II.,rather weaken the passage; for Homer nowhere else mentions periodical
4695,SECT. II.,"celebrations of any kind divided by any number of years, and I doubt"
4696,SECT. II.,whether such an idea does not involve greater familiarity with
4697,SECT. II.,numerical combinations than the Poet seems to have possessed.
4698,SECT. II.,
4699,SECT. II.,"Leaving these two lines subject to some doubt, but by no means fully"
4700,SECT. II.,"convicted, let us proceed to the third and last of the contested"
4701,SECT. II.,portions of the passage.
4702,SECT. II.,
4703,SECT. II.,(3)--Vss. 553-5.
4704,SECT. II.,
4705,SECT. II.,τῷ δ’ οὔπω τις ὁμοῖος ἐπιχθόνιος γένετ’ ἄνηρ
4706,SECT. II.,κοσμήσαι ἵππους τε καὶ ἀνέρας ἀσπιδιώτας·
4707,SECT. II.,Νέστωρ οἶος ἔριζεν· ὁ γὰρ προγενέστερος ἦεν.
4708,SECT. II.,
4709,SECT. II.,These lines were condemned by Zenodotus[193] upon the ground that we
4710,SECT. II.,"have no other mention of these gifts of Menestheus, and no example of"
4711,SECT. II.,his putting them in exercise. Mr. Payne Knight[194] also urges that
4712,SECT. II.,"Menestheus, here so commended with respect to chariots as well as"
4713,SECT. II.,"infantry, does not even appear as a competitor in the chariot-race"
4714,SECT. II.,"at the funeral games of Patroclus, although, in order to enlarge the"
4715,SECT. II.,"competition, even the slow horses of Nestor are put in requisition."
4716,SECT. II.,
4717,SECT. II.,"The Scholiast answers, with regard to the first objection, and"
4718,SECT. II.,"Heyne[195] accepts the defence as sufficient, that other persons are"
4719,SECT. II.,"praised in the gross, of whom no details are given anywhere: as Machaon"
4720,SECT. II.,is called ἀριστεύων in Il. xi. 506. But a mere general epithet is very
4721,SECT. II.,different from a set passage of three lines expressing extraordinary
4722,SECT. II.,preeminence in particular accomplishments.
4723,SECT. II.,
4724,SECT. II.,"Again, the word applied to Machaon is by no means one of abstract"
4725,SECT. II.,"panegyric, but is itself a description of the activity in the field by"
4726,SECT. II.,"which he was at the moment baffling the energies of Hector, and would,"
4727,SECT. II.,"says the Poet, have continued to baffle them, had not Paris wounded"
4728,SECT. II.,him. Thus the word is not a vague epithet: the words παῦσεν ἀριστεύοντα
4729,SECT. II.,"Μαχάονα simply mean, that the manful exertions of Machaon were arrested."
4730,SECT. II.,
4731,SECT. II.,There is another objection to the passage in the rather inflated
4732,SECT. II.,character of its compliment to an undistinguished man. Even
4733,SECT. II.,"Nestor[196], it says, did not beat him, but only (ἔριζεν) vied with"
4734,SECT. II.,"him: and this not as an abler, but only as an older, man."
4735,SECT. II.,
4736,SECT. II.,"On the other hand, some of the Scholiasts ingeniously suggest that"
4737,SECT. II.,these verses are given to Menestheus by way of compensation; τοῦτο
4738,SECT. II.,"χαρίζεται αὐτῷ, ἐπεὶ μὴ εὐδοκιμήσει ἐν ταῖς μάχαις[197]. But Homer"
4739,SECT. II.,"does not usually deal out compensation, among the Greeks, by abstract"
4740,SECT. II.,"praises, for the want of the honour earned by deeds: and all the other"
4741,SECT. II.,martial eulogies on chiefs in the Catalogue are well borne out in the
4742,SECT. II.,poem.
4743,SECT. II.,
4744,SECT. II.,"On the whole, Mr. Payne Knight’s objection, and the judgment of the"
4745,SECT. II.,"Alexandrine Critics, seem to leave this part of the passage in a state"
4746,SECT. II.,"so questionable, that nothing ought to be rested on it. The best"
4747,SECT. II.,"point in its favour is, that the Athenian Legates before Gelon are"
4748,SECT. II.,"represented by Herodotus as confidently relying on it, when there would"
4749,SECT. II.,"have been an interest on his part in demurring to its authority, for"
4750,SECT. II.,it was a question of military precedence that was at issue: τῶν καὶ
4751,SECT. II.,"Ὅμηρος ὁ ἐποποιὸς ἄνδρα ἄριστον ἔφησε εἰς Ἴλιον ἀπικέσθαι, τάξαι τε καὶ"
4752,SECT. II.,διακοσμῆσαι στράτον[198].
4753,SECT. II.,
4754,SECT. II.,"On the other hand, it may be observed with justice that the compliment"
4755,SECT. II.,here paid to Menestheus is the very best of which the case admitted;
4756,SECT. II.,perhaps the only one that an interpolator would have been safe in
4757,SECT. II.,selecting. For he would have known that any panegyric relating to
4758,SECT. II.,strength or prowess in action would be conclusively belied by the rest
4759,SECT. II.,of the poem in its entire tenour.
4760,SECT. II.,
4761,SECT. II.,"But while we cannot confidently rely upon these three lines, there"
4762,SECT. II.,appears to be no reason why we should not use the evidence supplied
4763,SECT. II.,by the rest of the passage as most probably good historic matter. It
4764,SECT. II.,undoubtedly represents a strong course of old local tradition[199]:
4765,SECT. II.,for there was in Athens a most ancient temple dedicated to Minerva and
4766,SECT. II.,Erechtheus in conjunction.
4767,SECT. II.,
4768,SECT. II.,_Review of the Homeric evidence._
4769,SECT. II.,
4770,SECT. II.,The Homeric evidence then up to this point stands as follows with
4771,SECT. II.,"reference to Athens and the Athenian contingent, or the principal and"
4772,SECT. II.,"picked men of it, whichever be the best term for the passage. They were"
4773,SECT. II.,
4774,SECT. II.,"1. Ionians, Il. xiii. 685."
4775,SECT. II.,
4776,SECT. II.,"2. ἑλκεχίτωνες, ibid."
4777,SECT. II.,
4778,SECT. II.,"3. Autochthonous, Il. ii. 547."
4779,SECT. II.,
4780,SECT. II.,4. Undistinguished in the war.
4781,SECT. II.,
4782,SECT. II.,"5. Under the special patronage of Pallas or Minerva, Il. ii. 546, and"
4783,SECT. II.,"Od. xi. 323, where the epithet ἱεράων, given to Athens, indicates a"
4784,SECT. II.,special relation to a deity.
4785,SECT. II.,
4786,SECT. II.,"The epithet ἑλκεχίτωνες suggests unwarlike habits, and, though"
4787,SECT. II.,"more faintly, it also betokens textile industry. It stands in"
4788,SECT. II.,"marked contrast with the ἀμιτροχίτωνες[200] of the valiant Lycians,"
4789,SECT. II.,whose short and spare tunic required no cincture to confine it. It
4790,SECT. II.,corroborates the negative evidence afforded by the Iliad of some want
4791,SECT. II.,of martial genius in the primitive Athens. It coincides with the
4792,SECT. II.,"tutelage of Pallas, for the Minerva of Homer has no more indisputable"
4793,SECT. II.,function than as the goddess of skilled industry[201]. All this tends
4794,SECT. II.,to betoken that the inhabitants of the Homeric Attica were Pelasgian.
4795,SECT. II.,
4796,SECT. II.,"Again, the autochthonic origin, ascribed to the Athenians in the person"
4797,SECT. II.,"of Erechtheus, amounts to an assertion that they were the first known"
4798,SECT. II.,"inhabitants of the country: in other words, that they were Pelasgian."
4799,SECT. II.,
4800,SECT. II.,The negative evidence is also important. There is nothing in Homer that
4801,SECT. II.,tends to associate Athens with the Hellenic stem. The want of military
4802,SECT. II.,distinction deserves a fuller notice.
4803,SECT. II.,
4804,SECT. II.,"It can hardly be without meaning, that of all the chiefs, considerable"
4805,SECT. II.,"in the Iliad by their positions and commands, there are but two who are"
4806,SECT. II.,"never named as in actual fight, or with any other mark of distinction,"
4807,SECT. II.,and these two are the heads of the two (as we suppose) emphatically
4808,SECT. II.,"Pelasgian contingents, from Athens and Arcadia respectively. Agapenor,"
4809,SECT. II.,"who (being however of Ætolian extraction) leads the Arcadians, is named"
4810,SECT. II.,"nowhere but in the Catalogue: Menestheus is repeatedly named, but never"
4811,SECT. II.,with reference to fighting. In the only part of the action of the poem
4812,SECT. II.,"where he is put forward, he shudders[202], and shows an anxiety for his"
4813,SECT. II.,"personal safety, much more like a Trojan leader than a Greek one. Yet"
4814,SECT. II.,"they were sole commanders, the first of no less than sixty ships, the"
4815,SECT. II.,second of fifty. There are no similar cases. The nearest to them are
4816,SECT. II.,"those (1) of Prothous[203], who commands 40 ships of the Magnesians,"
4817,SECT. II.,"and Gourieus[204], who leads 22 of the Enienes and Perrhæbi: both of"
4818,SECT. II.,"these are remote, Thessalian, and very probably Pelasgian tribes: (2)"
4819,SECT. II.,"of Podarkes, who commands 40 ships, but only as deputy for his deceased"
4820,SECT. II.,"brother Protesilaus, who is said to have been not only the elder, but"
4821,SECT. II.,the more valiant[205].
4822,SECT. II.,
4823,SECT. II.,"Agapenor, indeed, was evidently dependent in a peculiar sense on"
4824,SECT. II.,"Agamemnon, in whose ships he sailed: but this could not affect his"
4825,SECT. II.,position as to personal prowess. The case of Menestheus is the more
4826,SECT. II.,"remarkable from this circumstance, that he is the only independent"
4827,SECT. II.,"and single commander in charge of so many as fifty ships, who is not"
4828,SECT. II.,invested with the supreme rank of Βασιλεὺς or King. His father Peteos
4829,SECT. II.,"is however called Διοτρεφὴς Βασιλεὺς (Il. iv. 338), which marks him as"
4830,SECT. II.,having probably been a person of greater importance.
4831,SECT. II.,
4832,SECT. II.,And what is true of the commanders is true also of the troops.
4833,SECT. II.,"Athens, and with her Arcadia, may justly be regarded as the only two"
4834,SECT. II.,undistinguished in Homer among those states of Greece which afterwards
4835,SECT. II.,attained to distinction. For among the States which acquired fame in
4836,SECT. II.,"the historic ages, Argolis, Achaia, and Laconia hold through their"
4837,SECT. II.,chiefs very high places in the poem: Elis and Bœotia are conspicuous
4838,SECT. II.,in the anterior traditions which it enshrines. Only Attica and Arcadia
4839,SECT. II.,fail in exhibiting to us signs of early pre-eminence in the arts of
4840,SECT. II.,war: which in a marked manner confirms the suppositions we have already
4841,SECT. II.,"obtained, as to the Pelasgian character of their inhabitants."
4842,SECT. II.,
4843,SECT. II.,"A sign, though a more uncertain one, that points in the same"
4844,SECT. II.,"direction, is afforded by the choice of Athens, on the part of"
4845,SECT. II.,"Orestes[206], as his place of habitation during the tyranny of"
4846,SECT. II.,"Ægisthus in Mycenæ. The displaced, if they do not fly to the strong"
4847,SECT. II.,"for protection, go among those who are weaker, and where they may most"
4848,SECT. II.,"easily hold their ground, or even acquire power afresh. In other words,"
4849,SECT. II.,"in the case before us, an Hellenic exile would very naturally betake"
4850,SECT. II.,himself among a Pelasgian people.
4851,SECT. II.,
4852,SECT. II.,While however the indications of a predominating Pelasgian character
4853,SECT. II.,among the Athenians at the epoch of the _Troica_ appear to be varied
4854,SECT. II.,"and powerful, I must admit that they are crossed by one indication,"
4855,SECT. II.,"which is at first sight of an opposite character, I mean that which is"
4856,SECT. II.,afforded by their name. Even though we were to surrender the entire
4857,SECT. II.,"passages in the Catalogue respecting them, it would still be difficult"
4858,SECT. II.,to contend that the name of Athens and of Athenians is forged in six
4859,SECT. II.,"other places of the poems where one or the other of them is found,"
4860,SECT. II.,besides that there is a second allusion to Erechtheus in the Odyssey.
4861,SECT. II.,"Here we have then, attached to a people whom we suppose Pelasgian, a"
4862,SECT. II.,name connecting them immediately with a deity commonly reputed to be
4863,SECT. II.,"of strong Hellic propensities: connecting them, indeed, in a manner"
4864,SECT. II.,"so special as to be exclusive, because no other city or population in"
4865,SECT. II.,Homer takes its name from a deity at all. This indicates a relation of
4866,SECT. II.,the closest description: and it is quite independent of the suspected
4867,SECT. II.,"passage, which represents Minerva as the nurse or foster-mother of"
4868,SECT. II.,Erechtheus.
4869,SECT. II.,
4870,SECT. II.,_Athenian relations with Minerva._
4871,SECT. II.,
4872,SECT. II.,"Now it will be found, upon close examination, that Minerva plays a"
4873,SECT. II.,"very different part in the Iliad from Juno, the great protectress"
4874,SECT. II.,"of the Greeks, and from Neptune, their actual comrade in fight. The"
4875,SECT. II.,"difference even at first sight is this, that theirs appears to be"
4876,SECT. II.,"a national, hers more a personal and moral sentiment. In Juno, it"
4877,SECT. II.,"is sympathy with the Greeks as Greeks; in Neptune, antipathy to the"
4878,SECT. II.,Trojans as Trojans: but both cases are plainly distinguishable from the
4879,SECT. II.,temper and attitude of Minerva.
4880,SECT. II.,
4881,SECT. II.,"Her protection of Ulysses, whose character is the human counterpart"
4882,SECT. II.,"of her own, is the basis of the whole theurgy of the Odyssey, and is"
4883,SECT. II.,"also strongly marked in the Δολώνεια. Again, she comes, in the first"
4884,SECT. II.,"book[207], at the instance of Juno, to restrain and guide Achilles:"
4885,SECT. II.,"for Juno, it is stated, loved both Agamemnon and Achilles alike; which"
4886,SECT. II.,"may imply, that this was not the exact case with Minerva. So again,"
4887,SECT. II.,"she inspires Diomed[208] for the work of his ἀριστεῖα, with a view to"
4888,SECT. II.,his personal distinction[209]. On each of the two occasions when the
4889,SECT. II.,"two goddesses come down together from heaven, it is Juno that makes"
4890,SECT. II.,"the proposal. When Minerva prompts Pandarus to treachery, it is by"
4891,SECT. II.,"the injunction of Jupiter, issued on the suggestion of Juno[210]. In"
4892,SECT. II.,"the seventh book, however, she descends of herself on seeing that the"
4893,SECT. II.,"Greeks lose ground, tells Apollo that she was come, as he was, with"
4894,SECT. II.,"the intention to stay the battle[211], and the result of their counsel"
4895,SECT. II.,"is one of the single fights (that between Hector and Ajax), which were"
4896,SECT. II.,sure to issue in glory to the Greek heroes. Still she has not the rabid
4897,SECT. II.,"virulence against Troy which distinguishes Juno, which makes her exact"
4898,SECT. II.,"the decision for its destruction in the Olympian assembly, and which"
4899,SECT. II.,"leads Jupiter to say to her sarcastically, that if she could but"
4900,SECT. II.,"eat Priam and his children and subjects raw, then her anger would be"
4901,SECT. II.,satiated.
4902,SECT. II.,
4903,SECT. II.,"In fact, Juno has all the marks of a deity entirely Hellic: both in the"
4904,SECT. II.,"passionate character of her attachment, and in the absence of all signs"
4905,SECT. II.,whatever of any practical relation between her and the Trojan people.
4906,SECT. II.,
4907,SECT. II.,It is not so with Pallas. Pitilessly opposed to the Trojans in the
4908,SECT. II.,"war, she is nowhere so identified with the Greeks as to exhibit her"
4909,SECT. II.,"in the light of one of those deities, whose influence or sympathies"
4910,SECT. II.,were confined to any one place or nation. Her enmity to Troy is
4911,SECT. II.,mythologically founded on the Judgment of Paris[212]: but it has a more
4912,SECT. II.,substantive ethical ground in the nature of the quarrel between the two
4913,SECT. II.,countries.
4914,SECT. II.,
4915,SECT. II.,"Unlike Juno and Neptune, she was regularly worshipped at Troy, where"
4916,SECT. II.,"she had a priestess of high rank, and a temple placed, like that of"
4917,SECT. II.,"Apollo, on the height of Pergamus."
4918,SECT. II.,
4919,SECT. II.,"Distinct proof, however, that Minerva was neither originally at war"
4920,SECT. II.,"with the Trojans, nor unknown to them by her beneficial influences, is"
4921,SECT. II.,"afforded by the case of Phereclus son of Harmonides, the carpenter;"
4922,SECT. II.,"this Phereclus was the builder of the ships of Paris, and was a highly"
4923,SECT. II.,"skilled workman[213] by her favour,"
4924,SECT. II.,
4925,SECT. II.,ἐξόχα γάρ μιν ἐφίλατο Πάλλας Ἀθήνη.
4926,SECT. II.,
4927,SECT. II.,The name of Harmonides may be fictitious; but the relation to Pallas
4928,SECT. II.,"deserves remark, if we assume Troy to have been fundamentally"
4929,SECT. II.,"Pelasgian; and it affords a strong presumption, that there was nothing"
4930,SECT. II.,in the character of Minerva to prevent her being propitious to a
4931,SECT. II.,"Pelasgian country. Her attributes as the goddess of industry, or more"
4932,SECT. II.,"strictly, in our phrase, of manufacture, were indeed in no special"
4933,SECT. II.,"harmony with the character of the Pelasgians, as she had nothing to do"
4934,SECT. II.,with works of agriculture: but neither was there any antagonism between
4935,SECT. II.,them.
4936,SECT. II.,
4937,SECT. II.,There is also something that deserves notice in the speech in which
4938,SECT. II.,Minerva expresses to Juno her resentment at the restraint put upon
4939,SECT. II.,her by Jupiter. She accuses him of forgetting the services she had
4940,SECT. II.,so often rendered to Hercules when he was oppressed by the labours
4941,SECT. II.,"that Eurystheus had laid upon him, and declares that it was she who"
4942,SECT. II.,effected his escape from Hades[214]. Now this has all the appearance of
4943,SECT. II.,"being the fabulous dress of the old tradition, which reports that the"
4944,SECT. II.,"children of Hercules had taken refuge in Attica, and had been harboured"
4945,SECT. II.,there; that Eurystheus invaded the country in consequence of the
4946,SECT. II.,"protection thus given, and that he was slain while upon the expedition."
4947,SECT. II.,"It seems therefore possible, that this reception of the Heraclids may"
4948,SECT. II.,"have had something to do with the special relation, at the epoch of"
4949,SECT. II.,"the _Troica_, between Athens and Minerva as its tutelary goddess? In"
4950,SECT. II.,"connection with Hercules personally, the Iliad affords us another mark"
4951,SECT. II.,"that friendly relations might subsist between Troy and Pallas. She, in"
4952,SECT. II.,"conjunction with them,"
4953,SECT. II.,
4954,SECT. II.,"Τρῶες καὶ Πάλλας Ἀθήνη[215],"
4955,SECT. II.,
4956,SECT. II.,erected the rampart in which Hercules took refuge from the pursuing
4957,SECT. II.,monster.
4958,SECT. II.,
4959,SECT. II.,"But the full answer to the objection is of a wider scope, and is to"
4960,SECT. II.,"be found in the general character of this deity, which did not, like"
4961,SECT. II.,"inferior conceptions, admit of being circumscribed by the limits of a"
4962,SECT. II.,particular district or people.
4963,SECT. II.,
4964,SECT. II.,"It will hereafter be shewn, that, like Latona and Apollo in"
4965,SECT. II.,"particular, Minerva in Pagan fiction represents a disguised and"
4966,SECT. II.,solitary fragment of the true primeval tradition[216]. All such
4967,SECT. II.,"deities we may expect to find, and we do find, transmitted from the"
4968,SECT. II.,"old Pelasgians into the mythologies both of Greece and Rome, or those"
4969,SECT. II.,"common to Pelasgian and Hellene. We expect to find, and we do find,"
4970,SECT. II.,"them worshipped both among the Greeks and among the Trojans as gods,"
4971,SECT. II.,"not of this or that nation, but of the great human family. In theory,"
4972,SECT. II.,exclusive regard to the one side or the other comports far better with
4973,SECT. II.,the idea of such deities as represent unruly passions or propensities
4974,SECT. II.,"of our nature like Mars and Venus, or Mercury; or chief physical forces"
4975,SECT. II.,"like Neptune; or such as, like Juno, are the sheer product of human"
4976,SECT. II.,"imagination reflected upon the world above, and have no relation to any"
4977,SECT. II.,"element or part of a true theology. But the Homeric Jupiter, in so far"
4978,SECT. II.,"as he is a representative of supreme power and unity, and the Pallas"
4979,SECT. II.,"and Apollo of the poems by a certain moral elevation, and by various"
4980,SECT. II.,"incidents of their birth or attributes, show a nobler parentage[217]."
4981,SECT. II.,
4982,SECT. II.,"In the capacity of a traditive deity, Minerva is with perfect"
4983,SECT. II.,"consistency worshipped alike among Trojans and Greeks, Hellenic and"
4984,SECT. II.,"Pelasgian tribes. There is nothing strange, then, in our finding her"
4985,SECT. II.,the patroness of a Pelasgian people. The only strangeness is her being
4986,SECT. II.,(if so she was) more specially their patroness than of any other
4987,SECT. II.,"people. The very fact that, for the purposes of the war, Homer gives"
4988,SECT. II.,"her to the Greeks, might perhaps have prepared us to expect that we"
4989,SECT. II.,should find her special domicile among the Hellic portions of that
4990,SECT. II.,nation: but it supplies no absolute and conclusive reason for such
4991,SECT. II.,a domicile. But I close the discussion with these observations. In
4992,SECT. II.,"the first place, the Pelasgian character of the Athenians in early"
4993,SECT. II.,times is established by evidence too strong to be countervailed by
4994,SECT. II.,any such inference as we should be warranted in drawing to a contrary
4995,SECT. II.,"effect from the special connection with Minerva. Again, it may be that"
4996,SECT. II.,the connection of both with Hercules may contain a solution of the
4997,SECT. II.,"difficulty. But lastly, if, as we shall find reason to believe, the"
4998,SECT. II.,"traditive deities were the principal gods of ancient Greece, and if the"
4999,SECT. II.,entrance of the Hellic tribes brought in many new claimants upon the
5000,SECT. II.,"divine honours, it may after all seem not unreasonable that we should"
5001,SECT. II.,"find, in one of the most purely Pelasgian States, the worship of this"
5002,SECT. II.,great traditive deity less obscured than elsewhere by competition with
5003,SECT. II.,"that of the invaders, and consequently in more peculiar and conspicuous"
5004,SECT. II.,honour.
5005,SECT. II.,
5006,SECT. II.,An examination of the etymology of certain names in Homer will
5007,SECT. II.,"hereafter, I trust, confirm these reasonings on the Athens of"
5008,SECT. II.,"the heroic age: with this exception, we may now bid adieu to the"
5009,SECT. II.,investigation of the Homeric evidence of Pelasgianism in Attica.
5010,SECT. II.,
5011,SECT. II.,_Post-Homeric evidence._
5012,SECT. II.,
5013,SECT. II.,"That evidence certainly receives much confirmation, positive and"
5014,SECT. II.,"negative, from without. In the first place, though Hesiod supplies us"
5015,SECT. II.,"with an Hellen, and with a Dorus and Æolus among his sons, he says not"
5016,SECT. II.,a word of an Ion; and the tradition connecting Ion with Hellen through
5017,SECT. II.,"Xuthus is of later date: probably later than Euripides, who makes"
5018,SECT. II.,"Ion only the adopted son of Xuthus an Achæan[218], and the real son"
5019,SECT. II.,"of Creusa, an Erectheid; with Apollo, a Hellic, but also a Pelasgian"
5020,SECT. II.,"deity, for his father. Again, in the legendary times we do not hear of"
5021,SECT. II.,"the Athenians as invaders and conquerors, which was the character of"
5022,SECT. II.,"the Hellic tribes, but usually as themselves invaded; for example, by"
5023,SECT. II.,Eurystheus from the Peloponnesus.
5024,SECT. II.,
5025,SECT. II.,"In ancient tradition generally, the Athenians appear on the defensive"
5026,SECT. II.,"against Bœotians[219], Cretans, or others. And the reputed Pylian and"
5027,SECT. II.,Neleid descent of the Pisistratid family is a curious illustration of
5028,SECT. II.,the manner in which Attica was reported to have imported from abroad
5029,SECT. II.,"the most energetic elements of her own population[220], and also of the"
5030,SECT. II.,(so to speak) natural predominance of Hellic over Pelasgic blood.
5031,SECT. II.,
5032,SECT. II.,"Thucydides[221] informs us, that the Athenians were first among the"
5033,SECT. II.,"Greeks to lay aside the custom of bearing arms, and to cultivate ease"
5034,SECT. II.,and luxury. Of this we have perhaps already had an indication in the
5035,SECT. II.,words ἑλκεχίτωνες.
5036,SECT. II.,
5037,SECT. II.,"He also states that, on account of the indifferent soil[222], which"
5038,SECT. II.,offered no temptation comparable to those supplied by the more fertile
5039,SECT. II.,"portions of Greece, there was no ejection of the inhabitants from"
5040,SECT. II.,"Attica by stronger claimants. Τὴν γοῦν Ἀττικὴν, ἐκ τοῦ ἐπὶ πλεῖστον διὰ"
5041,SECT. II.,"τὸ λεπτογέων ἀστασίαστον οὖσαν, ἄνθρωποι ᾤκουν οἱ αὐτοὶ ἀεί. This is"
5042,SECT. II.,simply stating in another form what was usually expressed by declaring
5043,SECT. II.,them autochthons. It is part of their Pelasgian title.
5044,SECT. II.,
5045,SECT. II.,A remarkable passage in Herodotus covers the whole breadth of the
5046,SECT. II.,"ground that has here been taken; and it is important, because no doubt"
5047,SECT. II.,it expresses what that author considered to be the best of the current
5048,SECT. II.,"traditions, founded in notoriety, and what Crœsus likewise learned"
5049,SECT. II.,"upon a formal inquiry, undertaken with a view to alliances in Greece,"
5050,SECT. II.,"respecting the origin of the Athenians. Herodotus, like Homer, makes"
5051,SECT. II.,the Athenians Ionian; and in conformity with the construction here
5052,SECT. II.,"put upon Homer, he declares the Ionians not to be Hellenic, but to be"
5053,SECT. II.,"Pelasgian[223]. The Attic people, he goes on to say, having once been"
5054,SECT. II.,"Pelasgian became Hellenic[224]. According to some opinions[225], this"
5055,SECT. II.,change occurred when the Ionians came into Attica: but the evidence
5056,SECT. II.,"of Homer, I think, makes Athens Ionian at the same epoch when it"
5057,SECT. II.,is Pelasgian. I therefore construe the statement of Herodotus as
5058,SECT. II.,"signifying that the Athenians, in the course of time, received among"
5059,SECT. II.,themselves Hellenic immigrants from the more disturbed and changeful
5060,SECT. II.,"parts of Greece, and these immigrants impressed on Attica, as they had"
5061,SECT. II.,"done on other states[226], the Hellenic character and name; only with"
5062,SECT. II.,"the difference that, instead of a conflict, and the subjugation of"
5063,SECT. II.,"the original inhabitants, there came a process of more harmonious and"
5064,SECT. II.,"genial absorption, and in consequence, a development of Greek character"
5065,SECT. II.,even more remarkable for its fulness than in any other Grecian race.
5066,SECT. II.,"Even in the case of Attica, however, the Hellenic character was not"
5067,SECT. II.,"finally assumed without a collision, though perhaps a local and partial"
5068,SECT. II.,"one only, which ended in the ejectment of the Pelasgians. This conflict"
5069,SECT. II.,"is reported to us by Herodotus from Hecatæus[227], and if we find that"
5070,SECT. II.,"in it, according to the Athenian version of the story, the Pelasgians"
5071,SECT. II.,"were the wrong-doers, it is probably upon the ground that the winner"
5072,SECT. II.,"is always in the right: and the Athenians had the more need of a case,"
5073,SECT. II.,"because their policy demanded a justification, when, under Miltiades,"
5074,SECT. II.,"they followed the Pelasgians to Lemnos, and again subdued them there."
5075,SECT. II.,Each version of the Attican quarrel contains indications of being
5076,SECT. II.,related to the truth of the case: for the Pelasgians are made to
5077,SECT. II.,"declare, that the Athenians drove them out from the soil of which they"
5078,SECT. II.,"were the prior occupants, and which they cultivated so carefully as to"
5079,SECT. II.,"arouse their envy, while the Athenians alleged that when, before the"
5080,SECT. II.,"days of slavery, their children went to draw water at the Nine-Springs"
5081,SECT. II.,"(Ἐννεάκρουνοι), the Pelasgians of the district insulted them. What more"
5082,SECT. II.,"likely than that, when the Hellenic part of the population was coercing"
5083,SECT. II.,"the other portion of it into servitude, their resentment should"
5084,SECT. II.,occasionally find vent in rustic insolence to boys and maidens?
5085,SECT. II.,
5086,SECT. II.,The doctrine thus propagated by Herodotus concerning Attica is even
5087,SECT. II.,more strongly represented in Strabo as respects its Ionian character.
5088,SECT. II.,Τὴν μὲν Ἰάδα τῇ παλαίᾳ Ἀτθίδι τὴν αὐτὴν φαμέν· καὶ γὰρ Ἴωνες ἐκαλοῦντο
5089,SECT. II.,"οἱ τότε Ἀττικοὶ, καὶ ἐκεῖθεν εἰσιν οἱ τὴν Ἀσίαν ἐποικήσαντες Ἴωνες,"
5090,SECT. II.,καὶ χρησάμενοι τῇ νῦν λεγομένῃ γλώττῃ Ἰάδι[228]. The poverty of their
5091,SECT. II.,"soil kept them, he adds, apart as of a different race (ἔθνος), and of a"
5092,SECT. II.,different speech (γλώττη).
5093,SECT. II.,
5094,SECT. II.,And thus again Herodotus reports that the same letter which the Dorians
5095,SECT. II.,"called San, the Ionians called Sigma. Is not this more than a dialectic"
5096,SECT. II.,"difference, and does it not indicate a deeper distinction of race?[229]"
5097,SECT. II.,
5098,SECT. II.,The connection of the Pelasgians with ancient Attica will receive
5099,SECT. II.,further illustration from our inquiry hereafter into the general
5100,SECT. II.,evidence of the later tradition respecting that race.

5104,SECT. II.,
5105,SECT. II.,_Egypt and the Pelasgians._
5106,SECT. II.,
5107,SECT. II.,"If we are to venture yet one step further back, and ask to what"
5108,SECT. II.,extraneous race and country do the Pelasgic ages of Greece appear
5109,SECT. II.,"particularly to refer us as their type, the answer, as it would seem,"
5110,SECT. II.,"though it can only be given with reserve, must be, that Egypt and its"
5111,SECT. II.,"people appear most nearly to supply the pattern. A variety of notes,"
5112,SECT. II.,"indicative of affinity, are traceable at a variety of points where we"
5113,SECT. II.,"find reason to suspect a Pelasgian character: particularly in Troy,"
5114,SECT. II.,"and in the early Roman history, more or less in Hesiod and his school,"
5115,SECT. II.,"and in certain parts of Greece. Many of these notes, and likewise the"
5116,SECT. II.,"general character that they indicate, appear to belong to Egypt also."
5117,SECT. II.,
5118,SECT. II.,The direct signs of connection between Egypt and Greece are far less
5119,SECT. II.,"palpable in Homer, than between Greece and Phœnicia. We have no account"
5120,SECT. II.,"from him of Egyptians settled among the Greeks, or of Greeks among"
5121,SECT. II.,the Egyptians. The evidence of a trading intercourse between the two
5122,SECT. II.,"countries is confined to the case of the pseudo-Ulysses, who ventures"
5123,SECT. II.,thither from Crete under circumstances[230] which seem to show that
5124,SECT. II.,it was hardly within the ordinary circle of Greek communications.
5125,SECT. II.,"He arrives indeed in five days, by the aid of a steady north-west"
5126,SECT. II.,"wind: but a voyage of five days[231] across the open sea, which"
5127,SECT. II.,"might be indefinitely prolonged by variation or want of wind, was"
5128,SECT. II.,highly formidable to a people whose only safety during their maritime
5129,SECT. II.,enterprises lay in the power of hauling up their vessels whenever
5130,SECT. II.,needful upon a beach. It was near twice the length of the voyage
5131,SECT. II.,to Troy[232]. Hence we find that Menelaus was carried to Egypt not
5132,SECT. II.,"voluntarily, but by stress of weather: and Nestor speaks with horror of"
5133,SECT. II.,"his crossing such an expanse, a passage that even the birds make but"
5134,SECT. II.,once a year[233]. If this be deemed inconsistent with the five days’
5135,SECT. II.,"passage, yet even inconsistency on this point in Homer would be a proof"
5136,SECT. II.,"that the voyage to Egypt was in his time rare, strange, and mysterious"
5137,SECT. II.,"to his countrymen, and so was dealt with freely by him as lying beyond"
5138,SECT. II.,experience and measurement.
5139,SECT. II.,
5140,SECT. II.,There is nothing in Homer absolutely to contradict the opinion that
5141,SECT. II.,Danaus was Egyptian; but neither is there anything which suffices
5142,SECT. II.,conclusively to establish it. And if he considered the Egyptians to
5143,SECT. II.,"approach to the Pelasgian type, this may cast some slight doubt on"
5144,SECT. II.,the Egyptian origin of Danaus. The Poet certainly would not choose a
5145,SECT. II.,"Pelasgian name, unless fully naturalized, for one of the characteristic"
5146,SECT. II.,national designations of the Achæans. But he is too good a Greek to
5147,SECT. II.,give us particular information about any foreign eminence within his
5148,SECT. II.,"fatherland. It seems, however, possible that in the name ἀπίη, given"
5149,SECT. II.,"to Peloponnesus, there may lie a relation to the Egyptian Apis. Apis"
5150,SECT. II.,was the first of the four divine bulls of Egypt[234]; and the ox was
5151,SECT. II.,"the symbol of agriculture which, according to the tradition conveyed by"
5152,SECT. II.,"Æschylus[235], Danaus introduced into the Peloponnesus."
5153,SECT. II.,
5154,SECT. II.,The paucity of intercourse however between Greece and Egypt in the time
5155,SECT. II.,of Homer does not put a negative on the supposition that there may have
5156,SECT. II.,been early migration from the latter country to the former.
5157,SECT. II.,
5158,SECT. II.,It has been questioned how far the ancient Egyptians were conversant
5159,SECT. II.,with the art of navigation. The affirmative is fully argued by Mr.
5160,SECT. II.,M’Culloch[236] in his commentaries on Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations.
5161,SECT. II.,But it is plain that the Egyptians were not known to Homer as a
5162,SECT. II.,nautical people. Not only do we never on any occasion hear of them
5163,SECT. II.,"in connection with the use of ships, but we hear of the plunder of"
5164,SECT. II.,"their coast by pirates, when they confined themselves to resistance by"
5165,SECT. II.,land. This want of nautical genius agrees with all that we learn of
5166,SECT. II.,them in Holy Scripture. And it places them in marked resemblance to
5167,SECT. II.,the Pelasgian races generally: to the Arcadians[237]; to the Trojans;
5168,SECT. II.,"to the early Romans, who paid no serious attention to the creation of"
5169,SECT. II.,"a fleet until the second Samnite War B.C. 311, or, as Niebuhr thinks,"
5170,SECT. II.,"then only first had a fleet at all[238]: and again, to the landsmanlike"
5171,SECT. II.,"spirit of Hesiod, who calls himself"
5172,SECT. II.,
5173,SECT. II.,"οὔτε τι ναυτιλίης σεσοφισμένος, οὔτε τι νηῶν,"
5174,SECT. II.,
5175,SECT. II.,"limits it entirely to a certain season, never was at sea except"
5176,SECT. II.,"crossing from Aulis to Eubœa, and considers the whole business of going"
5177,SECT. II.,to sea one that had better be avoided[239].
5178,SECT. II.,
5179,SECT. II.,That with Homer the fabulous element enters into his view of the
5180,SECT. II.,"Egyptians seems plain, from his calling them the race of Paieon, in the"
5181,SECT. II.,same way as he calls the Phæacians the race of Neptune: and in some
5182,SECT. II.,degree also from the place which he gives them in the wanderings of
5183,SECT. II.,"Menelaus, since they lay, like those of Ulysses, in the exterior and"
5184,SECT. II.,unascertained sphere of geography.
5185,SECT. II.,
5186,SECT. II.,"Proteus is called Αἰγύπτιος, but in all probability the meaning"
5187,SECT. II.,"is Proteus of the Nile, which is the proper Αἴγυπτος in the"
5188,SECT. II.,"masculine gender; while the country, derivatively called from it"
5189,SECT. II.,"as the γῆ Αἴγυπτος, takes the feminine. We shall hereafter see how"
5190,SECT. II.,Proteus belongs to the circle of nautical and therefore Phœnician
5191,SECT. II.,tradition[240]. That deity has upon him all the marks of the outer
5192,SECT. II.,"and non-Grecian world. He is no less an admirable type of the πρωκτής,"
5193,SECT. II.,"than a regular servant of Neptune, Ποσειδάωνος ὑποδμώς (Od. iv. 386)."
5194,SECT. II.,This connection with Neptune by no means makes him Greek: Neptune was
5195,SECT. II.,"the god of the θάλασσα, which extended beyond the circle of Greek"
5196,SECT. II.,"experience, even to the borders of Ocean. We see set upon the whole of"
5197,SECT. II.,this adventure the same singular religious token as upon the remote
5198,SECT. II.,"adventures of Ulysses, namely this, that Menelaus passes beyond the"
5199,SECT. II.,ordinary charge of the Hellenic deities. The means of deliverance
5200,SECT. II.,"are pointed out to him, not by Minerva, but by Eidothea, daughter of"
5201,SECT. II.,"Proteus himself, whose name, function, and relationship alike remind"
5202,SECT. II.,"us that it was Ino Leucothea, daughter of the Phœnician Cadmus,"
5203,SECT. II.,"who appeared to Ulysses for his deliverance, in a nearly similar"
5204,SECT. II.,border-zone of the marine territory lying between the world of fable
5205,SECT. II.,and the world of experience; for the position of Egypt was in this
5206,SECT. II.,"respect like that of Phæacia. It would seem, then, as if Homer himself"
5207,SECT. II.,knew Egypt mainly through a Phœnician medium.
5208,SECT. II.,
5209,SECT. II.,Of the Phœnician intercourse with that country we may safely rest
5210,SECT. II.,"assured, from their proximity, from their resort thither mentioned in"
5211,SECT. II.,"Homer[241], and from the traces they left in Egypt itself."
5212,SECT. II.,
5213,SECT. II.,It seems a probable conjecture that they had from a very early date a
5214,SECT. II.,"colony or factory in Egypt, by which they carried on their commerce"
5215,SECT. II.,"with it. In the time of Herodotus, there was at Memphis a large and"
5216,SECT. II.,"well-cared-for τέμενος or demesne of Proteus, whom the priests reported"
5217,SECT. II.,to be the successor of Sesostris on the Egyptian throne. This demesne
5218,SECT. II.,"was surrounded by the habitations of the ‘Tyrian Phœnices,’ and the"
5219,SECT. II.,whole plain in which it stood was called the Τυρίων στρατόπεδον.
5220,SECT. II.,"There is another tradition in Herodotus, according to which the"
5221,SECT. II.,"Phœnicians furnished Egypt with the fleet, which in the time of Necho"
5222,SECT. II.,circumnavigated Africa[242].
5223,SECT. II.,
5224,SECT. II.,Homer affords us little or no direct evidence of a connection between
5225,SECT. II.,"the religion of Greece and an Egyptian origin, to which Herodotus"
5226,SECT. II.,"conceived it to be referable; but yet it may very well be the case,"
5227,SECT. II.,that Egypt was the fountain-head of many traditions which were carried
5228,SECT. II.,"by the Phœnicians into Greece. In Homer, for example, we find marks"
5229,SECT. II.,that seem to connect Dionysus with Phœnicia: but the Phœnicians
5230,SECT. II.,"may have become acquainted with him in Egypt, where Diodorus[243]"
5231,SECT. II.,"reports that Osiris was held to be his original. There are two marks,"
5232,SECT. II.,"however, of Egyptian influence, which seem to be more deeply traced."
5233,SECT. II.,One is the extraordinary sacredness attached to the oxen of the Sun.
5234,SECT. II.,"The other, the apparent relation between the Egyptian Neith and the"
5235,SECT. II.,"Athene of Attica, taken in conjunction with the Pelasgian character"
5236,SECT. II.,of the district[244]. But certainly our positive information from
5237,SECT. II.,Homer respecting the Egyptians may be summed up in very brief compass.
5238,SECT. II.,"They would appear to have been peaceful, rich, and prosperous: highly"
5239,SECT. II.,"skilled in agriculture, and also in medicine, if we are not rather"
5240,SECT. II.,"to understand by this that they knew the use of opium, which might"
5241,SECT. II.,readily draw fervid eulogiums from a race not instructed in its
5242,SECT. II.,properties. But the testimony to their agricultural excellence cannot
5243,SECT. II.,"be mistaken. Twice their fields are mentioned, and both times as"
5244,SECT. II.,περικάλλεες ἀγροί: in exact correspondence with the tradition which we
5245,SECT. II.,find subsisting in Attica respecting those fields which were tilled by
5246,SECT. II.,the Pelasgians[245]. And this case of the Egyptians is the only one
5247,SECT. II.,throughout the Poems in which Homer bestows commendation upon tillage.
5248,SECT. II.,"Again, they fought bravely when attacked[246]. We find also the name"
5249,SECT. II.,"Ægyptius naturalized in Ithaca. Lastly, they appear to have been"
5250,SECT. II.,"hospitable to strangers, and placable to enemies[247]. This is a faint"
5251,SECT. II.,outline: but all its features appear to be in harmony with those of the
5252,SECT. II.,Pelasgian race.
5253,SECT. II.,
5254,SECT. II.,"It is worthy of remark, that the Lotophagi visited by Ulysses"
5255,SECT. II.,"correspond very much with the Egyptians, such as Homer conceived them."
5256,SECT. II.,"Locally, they belonged to the Egyptian quarter of the globe: they"
5257,SECT. II.,received the companions of Ulysses with kindness[248]; and they gave
5258,SECT. II.,"them to eat of the lotus, which appears in its essential and remarkable"
5259,SECT. II.,properties exactly to correspond with the νήπενθες[249] that Helen
5260,SECT. II.,"had obtained from Egypt. As every figure of the Phœnician traditions,"
5261,SECT. II.,"except perhaps Æolus, is essentially either hard, or cruel, or"
5262,SECT. II.,"deceitful, even so, whether on account of neighbourhood or otherwise,"
5263,SECT. II.,it seems to have been the poet’s intention to impress the less
5264,SECT. II.,energetic but more kindly character of the Egyptians on this particular
5265,SECT. II.,"people, which perhaps he conceived to be allied to them."
5266,SECT. II.,
5267,SECT. II.,There is indeed one suggestive passage of the Odyssey from which it is
5268,SECT. II.,open to us to conjecture that there was more of substantive relation
5269,SECT. II.,between Greece and Egypt than Homer’s purpose as a national poet led
5270,SECT. II.,"him fully to disclose. Menelaus, when he returns to Egypt after hearing"
5271,SECT. II.,"from Proteus of the death of Agamemnon, raises in Egypt a mound in"
5272,SECT. II.,"honour of his brother[250], ἵν’ ἄσβεστον κλέος εἴη. But this mound"
5273,SECT. II.,"could not contribute to the glory of the slain king, unless Greece and"
5274,SECT. II.,its inhabitants were tolerably well known in Egypt.
5275,SECT. II.,
5276,SECT. II.,"Upon the whole, the evidence of the Homeric poems does not correspond"
5277,SECT. II.,with those later traditions which refer principally to Egypt as the
5278,SECT. II.,"origin of what is Greek. In considering this subject, we ought indeed"
5279,SECT. II.,to bear in mind Homer’s systematic silence as to the channels by
5280,SECT. II.,which foreign influences found their way into Greece. For it throws
5281,SECT. II.,us entirely upon such indirect evidence as he may (so to speak)
5282,SECT. II.,involuntarily afford. And we must also recollect firstly that the
5283,SECT. II.,"Egyptian influence, whatever it may have been, may perhaps have"
5284,SECT. II.,"operated more in the Pelasgian period, than in that Achæan age to which"
5285,SECT. II.,"the representations of Homer belong. Secondly, that much may have"
5286,SECT. II.,"reached Greece, as to religion or otherwise, in a Phœnician dress,"
5287,SECT. II.,which the Phœnicians themselves may have derived from Egypt.
5288,SECT. II.,
5289,SECT. II.,"There are other features, well known from all history to be Egyptian,"
5290,SECT. II.,"though not traced for them by the hand of Homer, which tend strongly"
5291,SECT. II.,"to confirm their relationship to the Pelasgian race, partly as it is"
5292,SECT. II.,"delineated in the Homeric outlines, and partly as it is known from"
5293,SECT. II.,later tradition. One of these points is the comparatively hard and
5294,SECT. II.,"unimaginative character of its mythology, conforming to that of the"
5295,SECT. II.,"race. It is interesting to notice how the Greeks, with their fine sense"
5296,SECT. II.,"of beauty, got rid at once, in whatever they derived from Egypt, of the"
5297,SECT. II.,"mythological deformities of gods incarnate in beasts, and threw them"
5298,SECT. II.,into the shapes of more graceful fable.
5299,SECT. II.,
5300,SECT. II.,A second point of Pelasgian resemblance is the strong ritual and
5301,SECT. II.,sacerdotal development of religion. A third is the want of the
5302,SECT. II.,political energies which build and maintain extensive Empire. With
5303,SECT. II.,"all its wealth, and its early civilization, this opulent state could"
5304,SECT. II.,"never make acquisitions beyond its own border, and has usually been"
5305,SECT. II.,"in subordination to some more masculine Power. A fourth is, the early"
5306,SECT. II.,use of solid masonry in public edifices. The remains in Greece and
5307,SECT. II.,Italy which are referred to the Pelasgians are indeed of much smaller
5308,SECT. II.,"dimensions than those of Egypt: but the Pelasgians of these countries,"
5309,SECT. II.,"so far as we know, had not time to attain any higher political"
5310,SECT. II.,"organization than that of small communities, with comparatively"
5311,SECT. II.,"contracted means of commanding labour. A fifth is their wealth itself,"
5312,SECT. II.,which causes Egyptian Thebes to be celebrated both in the Iliad and in
5313,SECT. II.,"the Odyssey, perhaps the only case in which the poet has thus repeated"
5314,SECT. II.,"himself, Il. ix. 381, and Od. iv. 126."
5315,SECT. II.,
5316,SECT. II.,"Lastly, the reputed derivation of the oracle at Dodona from Egypt"
5317,SECT. II.,harmonises with the Pelasgian character assigned to that seat
5318,SECT. II.,of worship by Homer. The tradition to this effect reported by
5319,SECT. II.,"Herodotus[251] was Greek, and not Egyptian: it was obtained by him on"
5320,SECT. II.,"the spot: and if Homer’s countrymen partook of the poet’s reserve,"
5321,SECT. II.,and his dislike of assigning a foreign source to anything established
5322,SECT. II.,"in Greece, a presumption arises that this particular statement would"
5323,SECT. II.,"not have been made, had it not rested on a respectable course of"
5324,SECT. II.,traditionary authority.
5325,SECT. II.,
5326,SECT. II.,_Silence of the Iliad._
5327,SECT. II.,
5328,SECT. II.,"It may however be asked, if the Pelasgians are to be regarded as"
5329,SECT. II.,"Greeks, and as the base of the Greek nation, and if Homer was familiar"
5330,SECT. II.,"with their name and position in that character, how happens it that he"
5331,SECT. II.,"never calls the Greeks Pelasgians, as he calls them Danaans, Argeians,"
5332,SECT. II.,"and Achæans, and never even gives us in the Iliad a Pelasgian race or"
5333,SECT. II.,tribe by name as numbered among the Greeks?
5334,SECT. II.,
5335,SECT. II.,"Now it is not a sufficient answer to say, that the Pelasgian race and"
5336,SECT. II.,name were falling under eclipse in the age of Homer; for we shall
5337,SECT. II.,see reason hereafter to suppose that the appellations of Danaan and
5338,SECT. II.,"Argeian were likewise (so to speak) preterite, though not yet obsolete,"
5339,SECT. II.,appellations; still Homer employs them freely.
5340,SECT. II.,
5341,SECT. II.,"Their case is essentially different, however, as we shall find, from"
5342,SECT. II.,"that of the Pelasgians, since those two names do not imply either any"
5343,SECT. II.,"blood different from that of the Achæan or properly Greek body, or any"
5344,SECT. II.,particular race which had supplied an element in its composition: one
5345,SECT. II.,"of these the Pelasgian name certainly does imply. Those names too,"
5346,SECT. II.,"without doubt, would not be used, unless they shed glory on the Greeks:"
5347,SECT. II.,the Pelasgian name could have no such treasure to dispense.
5348,SECT. II.,
5349,SECT. II.,"It should, however, here be observed, that an examination presently"
5350,SECT. II.,to be made of the force of the Argeian name will help us to account
5351,SECT. II.,"for the disappearance from Greece of the Pelasgian name, which it may"
5352,SECT. II.,perhaps have supplanted.
5353,SECT. II.,
5354,SECT. II.,"Let me observe, that if the Pelasgians did, in point of fact, supply"
5355,SECT. II.,"an element to the Greek nationality, which had, while still remaining"
5356,SECT. II.,"perceptibly distinct, become politically subordinate in Homer’s time,"
5357,SECT. II.,that is precisely the case in which he would be sure not to apply the
5358,SECT. II.,"name to the Greeks at large, nor to any Greek state, as its application"
5359,SECT. II.,could not under such circumstances be popular. His non-employment of
5360,SECT. II.,"it, therefore, for Greeks is _pro tanto_ a confirmation to the general"
5361,SECT. II.,argument of these pages.
5362,SECT. II.,
5363,SECT. II.,"If, again, there were a distinct people of Pelasgians among the Trojan"
5364,SECT. II.,"auxiliaries, and on the Greek side a large but subordinate Pelasgic"
5365,SECT. II.,"element, this would be ample reason both for his naming the Pelasgic"
5366,SECT. II.,"allies of the Trojans, with a view to the truth of his recital, and for"
5367,SECT. II.,his not using the Pelasgic name in connection with the Greeks; for in
5368,SECT. II.,no instance has he placed branches of the same race or tribe on both
5369,SECT. II.,"sides in the struggle. Glaucus and Sarpedon, the transplanted Æolids,"
5370,SECT. II.,"cannot be considered as exceptions, first, from the old date of their"
5371,SECT. II.,"Greek extraction: and secondly, because they are individuals, whereas"
5372,SECT. II.,"we now speak of tribes and races. The name, too, was more suited to the"
5373,SECT. II.,"unmixed Pelasgians of the Trojan alliance, than to a people, among whom"
5374,SECT. II.,it had grown pale beneath the greater splendour of famous dynasties and
5375,SECT. II.,of more energetic tribes.
5376,SECT. II.,
5377,SECT. II.,The application of this reasoning to the Pelasgi is fortified by its
5378,SECT. II.,being applicable to other Homeric names.
5379,SECT. II.,
5380,SECT. II.,_Thraces and Threicii._
5381,SECT. II.,
5382,SECT. II.,It can hardly be doubted that the name Θρῇξ is akin to Τραχὶν and
5383,SECT. II.,"τρῆχυς[252], that it means a highlander, or inhabitant of a rough"
5384,SECT. II.,"and mountainous country, and that it included the inhabitants of"
5385,SECT. II.,territories clearly Greek. This extended signification of the term
5386,SECT. II.,"explains the assertion of Herodotus[253], that the Thracians were the"
5387,SECT. II.,"most numerous of all nations, after the Indians."
5388,SECT. II.,
5389,SECT. II.,Now Homer makes Thamyris the Bard a Thracian; yet it is clear from his
5390,SECT. II.,"having to do with the Muses, and from the geographical points with"
5391,SECT. II.,"which Homer connects his name, that he must be a Greek[254]. They"
5392,SECT. II.,"are, Δώριον in the dominions of Pylos, where he met his calamity, and"
5393,SECT. II.,"the Œchalia of Eurytus in Thessaly, from whence he was making his"
5394,SECT. II.,journey[255]. Strabo tells us that Pieria and Olympus were anciently
5395,SECT. II.,"Thracian[256], and moreover, that the Thracians of Bœotia consecrated"
5396,SECT. II.,"Helicon to the Muses. Orpheus, Musæus, Eumolpus, were held to be"
5397,SECT. II.,"Thracians by tradition, yet it also made them write in Greek. I think"
5398,SECT. II.,"we may trace this descriptive character of the name Θρῇκες, and its not"
5399,SECT. II.,"yet having acquired fully the force of a proper name with Homer, in his"
5400,SECT. II.,"employment of it as an adjective, and not a substantive. It is very"
5401,SECT. II.,"frequently joined in the poems with the affix ἄνδρες, which he does"
5402,SECT. II.,not employ with such proper names as are in familiar and established
5403,SECT. II.,"use, such as Danaan, Argive, or Achæan. He says Achæan or Danaan"
5404,SECT. II.,"heroes, but never joins the names to the simple predicate ‘men.’ When"
5405,SECT. II.,"he says Ἀχαιὸς ἄνηρ, it is with a different force; it is in pointing"
5406,SECT. II.,out an individual among a multitude. Indeed in Homer it is not Θρῇξ but
5407,SECT. II.,"Θρηίκιος which means Thracian, of or belonging to the country called"
5408,SECT. II.,"Thrace, Θρῄκη. There is then sufficient evidence that Greeks of the"
5409,SECT. II.,highlands might be Thraces; and there may very probably have been whole
5410,SECT. II.,tribes so called among the Greeks. Yet we never have Thracians named
5411,SECT. II.,"by Homer on the Greek side, while on the Trojan side they appear as"
5412,SECT. II.,"supplying no less than two contingents of allies: one in the Catalogue,"
5413,SECT. II.,and another which had just arrived at the period of the Δολώνεια[257].
5414,SECT. II.,
5415,SECT. II.,These two appear to be entirely distinct tribes: because no connection
5416,SECT. II.,is mentioned between them; because the first contingent is described
5417,SECT. II.,"as being composed not of all the Thracians, but of all the Thracians"
5418,SECT. II.,"within the Hellespont: and lastly, because the new comers have their"
5419,SECT. II.,"own βασιλεὺς with them, as the first contingent had its leaders,"
5420,SECT. II.,"Acamas and Peirous. The Hellespont meant here seems to be the strait,"
5421,SECT. II.,"because it is ἀγαρρόος. And it is therefore possible, that while the"
5422,SECT. II.,"first contingent was supplied by the nearer tribes, the second may have"
5423,SECT. II.,been composed of those Thracians who lay nearer the Greek border.
5424,SECT. II.,
5425,SECT. II.,"Notwithstanding that Mars, who is so inseparably associated with"
5426,SECT. II.,"Thrace, fights on the Trojan side, we have no evidence from Homer which"
5427,SECT. II.,would warrant the assumption that he intended to connect the Thracians
5428,SECT. II.,more intimately with the Pelasgians than with the Hellenes. It may be
5429,SECT. II.,that the poet’s ethnical knowledge failed him. The wavering of Mars
5430,SECT. II.,seems to indicate a corresponding uncertainty in his own mind. Perhaps
5431,SECT. II.,with both the Thracian and Pelasgian names it was the breadth of their
5432,SECT. II.,range that constituted the difficulty. Some part of Thrace is with him
5433,SECT. II.,"ἐριβώλαξ[258]; it is the part from which the first contingent came, as"
5434,SECT. II.,the son of Peirous belonged to it. And that part is less mountainous
5435,SECT. II.,than the quarter which I have presumed may have supplied the contingent
5436,SECT. II.,of Rhesus. The epithet is the very same as is applied to the Pelasgian
5437,SECT. II.,Larissa[259]: and the Larissan Pelasgians are placed next to the first
5438,SECT. II.,Thracian contingent in the Trojan Catalogue.
5439,SECT. II.,
5440,SECT. II.,The most probable supposition for Thracians as well as Pelasgians
5441,SECT. II.,"is, that they had affinities in both directions; that they existed"
5442,SECT. II.,"among the Greeks diffusively, and were absorbed in names of greater"
5443,SECT. II.,splendour: but that on the Trojan side they still had distinct national
5444,SECT. II.,"existence, and therefore they are named on that side, while to avoid"
5445,SECT. II.,confusion silence is studiously maintained about them on the other.
5446,SECT. II.,"The whole race, says Grote, present a character more Asiatic than"
5447,SECT. II.,European[260].
5448,SECT. II.,
5449,SECT. II.,_Caucones and Leleges._
5450,SECT. II.,
5451,SECT. II.,Many other races have been recorded in the later traditions as having
5452,SECT. II.,in pre-historic times inhabited various parts of Greece. Such are
5453,SECT. II.,"Temnices, Aones, Hyantes, Teleboi. Of these Homer makes no mention."
5454,SECT. II.,"But there are two other races whom he names, the Leleges and Caucones,"
5455,SECT. II.,"and with respect to whom Strabo[261] has affirmed, that they were"
5456,SECT. II.,extensively diffused over Greece as well as over Asia Minor.
5457,SECT. II.,
5458,SECT. II.,"Homer has proceeded, with respect to the Caucones, exactly in the same"
5459,SECT. II.,way as with respect to the Pelasgi. In the Iliad he names them[262]
5460,SECT. II.,"among the Trojan allies, and is wholly silent about them in dealing"
5461,SECT. II.,"with the Greek races. But in the Odyssey, where he had no national"
5462,SECT. II.,"distinctions to keep in view, he names them as a people apparently"
5463,SECT. II.,"Greek, and dwelling on the western side of Greece. The pseudo-Mentor is"
5464,SECT. II.,"going among them on business, to obtain payment of a debt[263]: and the"
5465,SECT. II.,"manner in which they are mentioned, without explanation, shows that the"
5466,SECT. II.,name must have been familiar to Nestor and the other persons addressed.
5467,SECT. II.,Probably therefore they were a neighbouring tribe: certainly a Greek
5468,SECT. II.,"tribe, for we do not find proof that the Homeric Greeks carried on"
5469,SECT. II.,commerce except with their own race.
5470,SECT. II.,
5471,SECT. II.,The poet names them with a laudatory epithet: they are the Καύκωνες
5472,SECT. II.,μεγάθυμοι. This may remind us of his bounty in the same kind to the
5473,SECT. II.,Pelasgians: and it seems as though he had had a reverence for the
5474,SECT. II.,remains of the ancient possessors of the country.
5475,SECT. II.,
5476,SECT. II.,We have abundant signs of the Leleges on the Trojan side in the war.
5477,SECT. II.,"In the Tenth Book they appear as a contingent: but besides this,"
5478,SECT. II.,"Priam had for one of his wives Laothee, daughter of Altes, king of"
5479,SECT. II.,"the Lelegians, who are here called φιλοπτόλεμοι[264]. What is more"
5480,SECT. II.,"important, we find the expressions Λέλεγες καὶ Τρῶες[265] used together"
5481,SECT. II.,"in such a way, as implies the wide extension of the former as a race."
5482,SECT. II.,"In the Twentieth Iliad, Æneas in speaking of Achilles refers to his"
5483,SECT. II.,"former escape from the great warrior. He fought, says Æneas, under"
5484,SECT. II.,"the auspices of Minerva: who shed light before him, and bid him slay"
5485,SECT. II.,"Lelegians and Trojans,"
5486,SECT. II.,
5487,SECT. II.,ἠδ’ ἐκέλευεν
5488,SECT. II.,ἔγχεï χαλκείῳ Λέλεγας καὶ Τρῶας ἐναίρειν.
5489,SECT. II.,
5490,SECT. II.,"The Trojan force was in two main portions, each with many subdivisions:"
5491,SECT. II.,"first, the army of Priam, with those of his kindred or subordinate"
5492,SECT. II.,"princes: and, secondly, the allies, with their numerous and widely"
5493,SECT. II.,"dispersed races. In the passage just quoted, the word _Leleges_ must"
5494,SECT. II.,"either mean the great body of allies, or else it must, conjointly with"
5495,SECT. II.,"_Troes_, signify the whole mass of what we may call the indigenous"
5496,SECT. II.,troops. Now the former is highly improbable. Such differences as are
5497,SECT. II.,"implied in the combination of Thracians, Lycians, and Pelasgians, could"
5498,SECT. II.,"not well be, and nowhere else are comprehended by Homer under a single"
5499,SECT. II.,"name as one race or nation, though the Lycians, on account of their"
5500,SECT. II.,"excellence, are sometimes[266] taken to represent the whole body of"
5501,SECT. II.,"the allies. And again, if the Leleges meant the whole body of allies,"
5502,SECT. II.,"the Pelasgians would appear as a branch of them, which is contrary to"
5503,SECT. II.,all evidence and likelihood. If then the two words together represent
5504,SECT. II.,"those indigenous troops, as contradistinguished from the allies, who"
5505,SECT. II.,were arrayed in the five divisions that are enumerated in vv. 816-39 of
5506,SECT. II.,"the Second book, the question is, how is the sense to be distributed"
5507,SECT. II.,between them. And here there is not much room for doubt. The name Τρῶες
5508,SECT. II.,"had been assumed four generations before the war from King Tros, and"
5509,SECT. II.,"was therefore a political or dynastic name, not a name of race. It most"
5510,SECT. II.,probably therefore indicates either the inhabitants of Priam’s own
5511,SECT. II.,"city and immediate dominions, or else the ruling race, who held power"
5512,SECT. II.,"here, as elsewhere, among a subject population. In either case we must"
5513,SECT. II.,"conclude that the word Leleges is meant to indicate the blood, and also"
5514,SECT. II.,the blood-name (so to speak) of the bulk of the population through a
5515,SECT. II.,considerable tract of country: and it will be observed that in the
5516,SECT. II.,fourth and fifth of the divisions[267] in the Trojan Catalogue Homer
5517,SECT. II.,specifies no blood-name or name of race whatever.
5518,SECT. II.,
5519,SECT. II.,"This being so, we find an important light cast upon the meaning of"
5520,SECT. II.,"the word Leleges. As we proceed with these inquiries, we shall find"
5521,SECT. II.,accumulating evidence of the Pelasgianism of the mass of the population
5522,SECT. II.,on the Trojan side: and thus when it appears that that mass or a very
5523,SECT. II.,"great part of it was Lelegian, it also appears probable that the"
5524,SECT. II.,"Leleges were at least akin to the Pelasgians, though some have taken"
5525,SECT. II.,them to be distinct[268].
5526,SECT. II.,
5527,SECT. II.,"In answer therefore to the question, who were these Caucones and these"
5528,SECT. II.,"Leleges, while we are deficient in the means of detailed and particular"
5529,SECT. II.,"reply, we may, I think, fall back with tolerable security upon the"
5530,SECT. II.,words used by Bishop Thirlwall in closing an ethnological survey:
5531,SECT. II.,
5532,SECT. II.,“The review we have just taken of the Pelasgian settlements in Greece
5533,SECT. II.,appears inevitably to lead to the conclusion that the name Pelasgians
5534,SECT. II.,"was a general one, like that of Saxons, Franks, or Alemanni: but that"
5535,SECT. II.,each of the Pelasgian tribes had also one peculiar to itself[269].”
5536,SECT. II.,
5537,SECT. II.,"Upon our finding, as we find, the Pelasgian name in certain apparent"
5538,SECT. II.,"relations with others, such as Leleges and Caucones, it appears more"
5539,SECT. II.,"reasonable to presume a relationship between them, than the reverse:"
5540,SECT. II.,for nothing can be more improbable than the simultaneous presence at
5541,SECT. II.,"that early period of a multitude of races, radically distinct from each"
5542,SECT. II.,"other, and yet diffused intermixedly over the same country upon equal"
5543,SECT. II.,"terms, and if there was a relationship, it would most probably be that"
5544,SECT. II.,"of subdivision, under which Leleges and Caucones might be branches of"
5545,SECT. II.,the widely spread Pelasgian family.
5546,SECT. II.,
5547,SECT. II.,"This opinion is supported, not only by presumptions, but by much"
5548,SECT. II.,"indirect evidence. It is indisputable that various names were applied,"
5549,SECT. II.,"by the custom of the Homeric age, to the same people, and at the"
5550,SECT. II.,same period. The poet calls the inhabitants of Elis both Elians and
5551,SECT. II.,"Epeans. The people of Ithaca are Ithacesians (Ἰθακήσιοι), but there"
5552,SECT. II.,"are also Ἀχαιοί[270], and in the Catalogue they are included under"
5553,SECT. II.,the Cephallenians[271]. The Dolopians in the speech of Phœnix[272]
5554,SECT. II.,are included under the Phthians; and are also within the scope of the
5555,SECT. II.,"other names applied by the Catalogue to the followers of Achilles, who"
5556,SECT. II.,"were called by the name of Myrmidons, or of Hellens, or of Achæans. Of"
5557,SECT. II.,"these the first seems to be the denomination, which the ruling race"
5558,SECT. II.,of that particular district had brought with it into the country. The
5559,SECT. II.,"third probably belongs to the Myrmidons, as members of that tribe, of"
5560,SECT. II.,"Hellic origin, which at the time predominated in Greece generally."
5561,SECT. II.,"The second, as we shall find, was the common name for all Greek tribes"
5562,SECT. II.,"of that origin, and was the name which ultimately gained a complete"
5563,SECT. II.,ascendancy in the country. Of the five nations of Crete in the
5564,SECT. II.,"Seventeenth Odyssey[273], either all or several are probably included"
5565,SECT. II.,"in the Κρῆτες of the Second Iliad[274]. Nay, we may now declare it"
5566,SECT. II.,"to be at least highly probable[275], that the Ionian name was a"
5567,SECT. II.,sub-designation of the Pelasgians. Thus we have abundant instances of
5568,SECT. II.,"plurality in the designations of tribes. On the whole, we shall do best"
5569,SECT. II.,to assume that the names in question of Leleges and Caucones indicated
5570,SECT. II.,"Pelasgian subdivision. The inquiry is, however, one of ethnical"
5571,SECT. II.,"antiquarianism only; these names are historically insignificant, for,"
5572,SECT. II.,"apart from the Pelasgian, they carry no distinctive character or"
5573,SECT. II.,special function in reference to Greece.

5904,SECT. III.,This appears to be the place for a more full consideration of the
5905,SECT. III.,"testimony of Homer with respect to, probably, the greatest character"
5906,SECT. III.,"of early Greek history, and one who cannot be omitted in any inquiry"
5907,SECT. III.,concerning the early Pelasgians of Greece: in as much as they stand in
5908,SECT. III.,"a direct Homeric relation to Crete, of which he was the king."
5909,SECT. III.,
5910,SECT. III.,"In the poems of Homer, Minos appears to stand forth as the first great"
5911,SECT. III.,and fixed point of Greek nationality and civilization. He is not indeed
5912,SECT. III.,"so remote from the period of Homer himself as others, even as other"
5913,SECT. III.,"Europeans, whom the poet mentions, and whom he connects by genealogy"
5914,SECT. III.,"with the Trojan period, particularly the Æolids. But the peculiarities"
5915,SECT. III.,"meeting in his case, as compared with most of them, are these:"
5916,SECT. III.,
5917,SECT. III.,1. That he is expressly traced upwards as well as downwards.
5918,SECT. III.,
5919,SECT. III.,2. That he is connected with a fixed place as its sovereign.
5920,SECT. III.,
5921,SECT. III.,3. That so much is either recounted or suggested of his character and
5922,SECT. III.,acts.
5923,SECT. III.,
5924,SECT. III.,4. That the Homeric traditions as to Minos are so remarkably supported
5925,SECT. III.,from without.
5926,SECT. III.,
5927,SECT. III.,"Minos is mentioned, and somewhat largely, in no less than six different"
5928,SECT. III.,passages of the Iliad and Odyssey. Homer has given us a much fuller
5929,SECT. III.,"idea of him, than of the more popular hero Hercules, although he is not"
5930,SECT. III.,"named in nearly so many passages; and it is singular, that the more"
5931,SECT. III.,ancient of the two personages is also by much the more historical.
5932,SECT. III.,"Again, the poet has told us more about Minos, although he is of foreign"
5933,SECT. III.,"extraction, than he has said about all the rest of the older Greek"
5934,SECT. III.,"heroes put together. Of Theseus, Pirithous, Castor, Pollux, Meleager,"
5935,SECT. III.,"Perseus, Jason, and the rest, his notices are very few and meagre."
5936,SECT. III.,"In dealing with Homer, I should quote even this fact of the greater"
5937,SECT. III.,"amount of his references, which in the case of most other poets would"
5938,SECT. III.,"be immaterial, as a strong presumption of the superior historical"
5939,SECT. III.,importance of the person concerned.
5940,SECT. III.,
5941,SECT. III.,"Minos, according to Homer, had Jupiter for his father, a Phœnician"
5942,SECT. III.,"damsel for his mother, and Rhadamanthus for his younger brother."
5943,SECT. III.,"The name[276] of his mother is not recorded, but Jupiter calls her"
5944,SECT. III.,"far-famed. This fame, if due to her beauty, would probably have kept"
5945,SECT. III.,"her name alive; but as it has not been preserved, it is more probably a"
5946,SECT. III.,reflection from the subsequent greatness of her son.
5947,SECT. III.,
5948,SECT. III.,The story thus far appears probably to indicate that Minos was a
5949,SECT. III.,"Phœnician by birth, but without a known ancestry, and raised into"
5950,SECT. III.,celebrity by his own energies and achievements.
5951,SECT. III.,
5952,SECT. III.,"The mode, by which he rose to fame, was by the government of men and"
5953,SECT. III.,"the foundation of civil institutions. At nine years old he received,"
5954,SECT. III.,"such is the legend, revelations from Jupiter,[277] and reigned, in"
5955,SECT. III.,"the great or mighty city (μεγάλη πόλις) of Cnossus, over Crete: such"
5956,SECT. III.,"was the form, copied by the politic legislator of Rome, in which a"
5957,SECT. III.,"title to veneration was secured for his laws. No other city, besides"
5958,SECT. III.,"this capital, is described in Homer by the epithet μεγάλη, or by any"
5959,SECT. III.,equivalent word.
5960,SECT. III.,
5961,SECT. III.,A further vivid mark of his political greatness is afforded us by that
5962,SECT. III.,"passage in the Odyssey, which exhibits him not simply as exercising"
5963,SECT. III.,"in the world beneath[278] the mere office of a judge, but rather as"
5964,SECT. III.,discharging there a judicial function in virtue of his sovereignty.
5965,SECT. III.,"Such is the force of the word θεμιστεύειν,[279] which signifies rather"
5966,SECT. III.,"to give law than to administer it: or, at least, to exercise the"
5967,SECT. III.,function of a king rather than of a judge[280] (ἵστωρ). He is described
5968,SECT. III.,"as still the illustrious son of Jupiter, Διὸς ἀγλαὸς υἱός. Even there"
5969,SECT. III.,he appears not as one of the suffering or bewildered inhabitants of
5970,SECT. III.,"that lower world, but in the exercise of power as an actual ruler among"
5971,SECT. III.,the spirits of the departed;
5972,SECT. III.,
5973,SECT. III.,οἱ δέ μιν ἀμφὶ δίκας εἴροντο ἄνακτα.
5974,SECT. III.,
5975,SECT. III.,He only is invested with any character of this kind. Every other
5976,SECT. III.,"apparition below is either in actual suffering, or gloomy and depressed."
5977,SECT. III.,
5978,SECT. III.,"The epithet ὀλοόφρων, applied to Minos in an earlier passage of the"
5979,SECT. III.,"Νεκυία, might perhaps convey the same idea as Virgil has rendered by"
5980,SECT. III.,"his _durissima_ regna,[281] in the description of Rhadamanthus: and we"
5981,SECT. III.,"may also compare the address of Menelaus in the Third Iliad to Jupiter,"
5982,SECT. III.,
5983,SECT. III.,Ζεῦ πάτερ οὔτις σεῖο θεῶν ὀλοώτερος ἄλλος.[282]
5984,SECT. III.,
5985,SECT. III.,A reasonable construction would refer the word to the commercial
5986,SECT. III.,"character of the Phœnician people, at once cunning and daring[283]; and"
5987,SECT. III.,"there is much probability in the opinion of Höck, who interprets the"
5988,SECT. III.,"word as meaning ‘exactor of tribute,’ or as alluding to the exaction by"
5989,SECT. III.,Minos of a tribute from Attica[284]. On this we shall shortly have to
5990,SECT. III.,enlarge.
5991,SECT. III.,
5992,SECT. III.,_Power of Crete._
5993,SECT. III.,
5994,SECT. III.,"As to the family and kingdom of Minos, we should gather in the first"
5995,SECT. III.,"place from Homer, that Crete had under him been preeminent in power. He"
5996,SECT. III.,"was king of the island (Κρήτῃ ἐπίουρος)[285], and he reigned, at the"
5997,SECT. III.,"age of nine years only (ἐννέωρος βασίλευε), in Cnossus over the five"
5998,SECT. III.,"nations. The island had ninety, or in the rounder numbers, an hundred"
5999,SECT. III.,cities. Two generations had passed since Minos; Idomeneus his grandson
6000,SECT. III.,"did not apparently reign, like Minos himself, over the whole of it:"
6001,SECT. III.,"for if this had been the case, it is very improbable, presuming that"
6002,SECT. III.,we may judge by the analogies which the order of the army in general
6003,SECT. III.,"supplies, that Meriones would have been made his associate, which"
6004,SECT. III.,"in some manner he is, in the command; and again, the feigned story"
6005,SECT. III.,"of Ulysses in the Odyssey, though it introduces Idomeneus, does not"
6006,SECT. III.,"represent him as king of the whole island, but rather implies that his"
6007,SECT. III.,"pretended brother, Æthon, also exercised a sovereignty there[286]. But"
6008,SECT. III.,"even then the Cretan contingent, although the towns named as supplying"
6009,SECT. III.,"it do not extend over the whole island[287], amounted to eighty ships,"
6010,SECT. III.,"and thus exceeded any other, except those of Agamemnon and of Nestor."
6011,SECT. III.,"And then, when Minos had so long been dead, it was still the marked and"
6012,SECT. III.,"special distinction of the country, that it was the seat of his race."
6013,SECT. III.,"So Eumæus, describing the disguised stranger to Penelope, says[288],"
6014,SECT. III.,
6015,SECT. III.,"φησὶ δ’ Ὀδυσσῆος ξεῖνος πατρώïος εἶναι,"
6016,SECT. III.,"Κρήτῃ ναιετάων, ὅθι Μίνωος γένος ἐστίν."
6017,SECT. III.,
6018,SECT. III.,A passage which perhaps testifies that the family of Minos had been
6019,SECT. III.,ξεῖνοι to the predecessors of Ulysses.
6020,SECT. III.,
6021,SECT. III.,But perhaps there is no country in Greece which Homer so rarely
6022,SECT. III.,"mentions without a laudatory epithet. Though (περίρρυτος) sea-girt,"
6023,SECT. III.,"it is not with him an island: it is Κρήτη γαῖα, Κρήτη εὐρεῖα, Κρήτη"
6024,SECT. III.,"ἑκατόμπολις[289], and in the principal description, Homer exalts it"
6025,SECT. III.,"more highly, I think, than any other territory,"
6026,SECT. III.,
6027,SECT. III.,"Κρήτη τις γαῖ’ ἐστὶ, μέσῳ ἐνὶ οἴνοπι πόντῳ"
6028,SECT. III.,"καλὴ καὶ πίειρα, περίρρυτος· ἐν δ’ ἄνθρωποι"
6029,SECT. III.,"πολλοὶ, ἀπειέσιοι, καὶ ἐννήκοντα πόληες[290]."
6030,SECT. III.,
6031,SECT. III.,If it should be thought that the evidence to the character of Minos as
6032,SECT. III.,"a lawgiver is slight, we must call to mind that even the word _law_"
6033,SECT. III.,is not found in Homer. The term afterwards used by the Greeks to
6034,SECT. III.,"express what we mean by a law, νόμος, only occurs with Homer in a sense"
6035,SECT. III.,quite different. He tells us of nothing more determinate than δίκαι
6036,SECT. III.,"and θέμιστες. But relatively to his pictures of other governors, the"
6037,SECT. III.,legislatorial character of Minos is as strongly marked as that of Numa
6038,SECT. III.,"is in Livy, relatively to other kings of Rome."
6039,SECT. III.,
6040,SECT. III.,"In conclusion, as to the region of Crete, it was inhabited by five"
6041,SECT. III.,"races: namely,"
6042,SECT. III.,
6043,SECT. III.,1. Ἀχαιοί.
6044,SECT. III.,2. Ἐτεοκρῆτες.
6045,SECT. III.,3. Κυδῶνες.
6046,SECT. III.,4. Δωριέες.
6047,SECT. III.,5. Πελάσγοι.
6048,SECT. III.,
6049,SECT. III.,_Pelasgianism in Crete._
6050,SECT. III.,
6051,SECT. III.,Of these the Achæans and Dorians are evidently Greek. We are now
6052,SECT. III.,examining at large the title of the Pelasgi to the same character. With
6053,SECT. III.,"respect to the Cydones, we may draw an inference from the facts, that"
6054,SECT. III.,"they lived (Od. iii. 292), on a Cretan river Iardanus, and that this"
6055,SECT. III.,was also the name of a river of Peloponnesus (Il. vii. 133). I should
6056,SECT. III.,"even hold that this stream, which is not identified, was most probably"
6057,SECT. III.,"in Arcadia: first, because in the contest with the Hellic tribes of"
6058,SECT. III.,"Pylos, the Arcadians as Pelasgians would be on the defensive, and would"
6059,SECT. III.,"therefore fight on their own ground: secondly, because the battle was"
6060,SECT. III.,on the ὠκύροος Κελάδων. These words are most suitable to some mountain
6061,SECT. III.,"feeder of the Iardanus, with its precipitate descent, rather than to"
6062,SECT. III.,"the usually more peaceful course of a river near the sea, especially"
6063,SECT. III.,"near the sea coast of sandy Pylus, which reached to the Alpheus[291]."
6064,SECT. III.,This supposition respecting the Celadon will also best account for
6065,SECT. III.,"what otherwise seems singular; namely, that the battle was at once on"
6066,SECT. III.,"the Celadon, and also about the Iardanus (Ἰαρδάνου ἀμφὶ ῥεέθρα[292])."
6067,SECT. III.,"Again, the battle was between Arcadians and Pylians, and therefore,"
6068,SECT. III.,"from the relative situation of the territories, was probably on some"
6069,SECT. III.,"Arcadian feeder of the Alpheus, lying far inland. Now if Iardanus was"
6070,SECT. III.,"an Arcadian river, and if the Arcadians were Pelasgi, it leads to a"
6071,SECT. III.,"presumption that the Cydonians of Crete, who dwelt upon an Iardanus,"
6072,SECT. III.,were Pelasgian also.
6073,SECT. III.,
6074,SECT. III.,"There remain the Ἐτεοκρῆτες, apparently so called, to distinguish them"
6075,SECT. III.,"as indigenous from all the other four nations, who were ἐπήλυδες, or"
6076,SECT. III.,"immigrant. This is curious, because it refers us elsewhere for the"
6077,SECT. III.,origin of the Pelasgi. It is the only case in which we hear of any
6078,SECT. III.,"thing anterior to them, upon the soils which they occupied. Lastly,"
6079,SECT. III.,"Crete lay between Greece and Cyprus, and Cyprus is clearly indicated"
6080,SECT. III.,in the Odyssey as on the route to Egypt[293].
6081,SECT. III.,
6082,SECT. III.,"But we hear also of Rhadamanthus as the brother of Minos, of Deucalion"
6083,SECT. III.,"as his son, and of Ariadne as his daughter[294]. And the notices of"
6084,SECT. III.,these personages in Homer all tend to magnify our conception of his
6085,SECT. III.,power and his connections.
6086,SECT. III.,
6087,SECT. III.,"Theseus, who is glorified by Nestor as a first rate hero[295], and"
6088,SECT. III.,"described as a most famous child of the gods[296], whom both Homer,"
6089,SECT. III.,"and also the later legends connect with Attica, marries Ariadne, who"
6090,SECT. III.,dies on her way to Athens[297]. The marriages of Homer were generally
6091,SECT. III.,contracted among much nearer neighbours. This more distant connection
6092,SECT. III.,"cannot, I think, but be taken as indicating the extended relations"
6093,SECT. III.,connected with the sovereignty of Minos and his exalted position.
6094,SECT. III.,
6095,SECT. III.,_Traditions of Deucalion._
6096,SECT. III.,
6097,SECT. III.,"The genealogy of Idomeneus runs thus[298]; ‘Jupiter begot Minos, ruler"
6098,SECT. III.,"of Crete. Minos begot a distinguished son, Deucalion. Deucalion begot"
6099,SECT. III.,"me, a ruler over numerous subjects in broad Crete.’"
6100,SECT. III.,
6101,SECT. III.,"Here it is to be remarked,"
6102,SECT. III.,
6103,SECT. III.,"1. That while Minos and Idomeneus, the first and third generations,"
6104,SECT. III.,"are described as ruling in Crete, Deucalion of the second is not so"
6105,SECT. III.,described.
6106,SECT. III.,
6107,SECT. III.,2. That Idomeneus is nowhere described as having succeeded to the
6108,SECT. III.,"throne of his grandfather Minos, but only as being a ruler in Crete:"
6109,SECT. III.,"and that, as we have seen, from the qualified conjunction of Meriones"
6110,SECT. III.,"with him in the command, perhaps also from the limited range of the"
6111,SECT. III.,"Cretan towns in the Catalogue, there arises a positive presumption that"
6112,SECT. III.,he had succeeded only to a portion of the ancient preeminence and
6113,SECT. III.,power of his ancestor.
6114,SECT. III.,
6115,SECT. III.,Now there is no direct evidence in Homer connecting Deucalion with
6116,SECT. III.,"Thessaly. The later tradition, however, places him there: and this"
6117,SECT. III.,tradition may probably claim an authority as old as that of Hesiod. A
6118,SECT. III.,"fragment of that poet[299], with the text partially corrupt, speaks of"
6119,SECT. III.,"Locrus, leader of the Leleges, as among those whom Jupiter raised from"
6120,SECT. III.,the earth for Deucalion. This reference to Locrus immediately suggests
6121,SECT. III.,"the name of the Locrian race, and so carries us into the immediate"
6122,SECT. III.,neighbourhood of Thessaly; and the general purport of the words is to
6123,SECT. III.,"express something a little like the later tradition about Deucalion,"
6124,SECT. III.,which had that country for its scene. Combining this with the negative
6125,SECT. III.,"evidence afforded by the Homeric text, we thus find established a"
6126,SECT. III.,"communication seemingly direct between Crete under Minos, and Thessaly,"
6127,SECT. III.,to which country we have already found it probable that Deucalion
6128,SECT. III.,"immigrated, and where he may have reigned."
6129,SECT. III.,
6130,SECT. III.,"The usual statement is, that the name Deucalion was common to two"
6131,SECT. III.,"different persons, one the son of Minos, and the other the king of"
6132,SECT. III.,Thessaly. But we must be upon our guard against the device of the later
6133,SECT. III.,"Greek writers, who at once unravelled the accumulated intricacies"
6134,SECT. III.,"that had gradually gathered about their traditions, and enlarged the"
6135,SECT. III.,"stock of material for pampering vanity, and exciting the imagination,"
6136,SECT. III.,by multiplying the personages of the early legends. As regards the
6137,SECT. III.,"case now before us; the tradition, which makes Hellen son of the"
6138,SECT. III.,"latter of these Deucalions, would certainly make him considerably"
6139,SECT. III.,"older than he could be if a son of Minos. It must be admitted, that"
6140,SECT. III.,"Homer repeats the name of Deucalion, for a Trojan so called is slain"
6141,SECT. III.,by Achilles in Il. xx. 478. It has pleased the fancy of the poet
6142,SECT. III.,there to use the names of a number of dead heroes to distinguish the
6143,SECT. III.,warriors who fell like sheep under the sword of the terrible Achilles:
6144,SECT. III.,"we find among them a Dardanus, a Tros, and a Moulius; and it is so"
6145,SECT. III.,"little Homer’s practice to use names without a peculiar meaning, that"
6146,SECT. III.,"we may conjecture he has done it, in preference to letting Achilles"
6147,SECT. III.,"slaughter a crowd of ignoble persons, in order that in every thing his"
6148,SECT. III.,Protagonist might be distinguished from other men. But the poet seems
6149,SECT. III.,"to take particular care to prevent any confusion as to his great Greek,"
6150,SECT. III.,"and indeed as to all his great living, personages. I am not aware of"
6151,SECT. III.,"more than one single passage in the Iliad[300], among the multitude"
6152,SECT. III.,"in which one or other of the Ajaxes is named, where there can be a"
6153,SECT. III.,doubt which of the two is meant. It is exceedingly unlikely that if a
6154,SECT. III.,"separate Deucalion of Thessaly had been known to Homer, he should not"
6155,SECT. III.,have distinguished him from the Deucalion of Crete. This unlikelihood
6156,SECT. III.,"mounts to incredibility, when we remember (1) that this other Deucalion"
6157,SECT. III.,of Thessaly is nothing less than the asserted root of the whole
6158,SECT. III.,"Hellenic stock, and (2) that the poet repeatedly uses the patronymic"
6159,SECT. III.,"Deucalides as an individual appellation for Idomeneus, whereas the"
6160,SECT. III.,adverse supposition would make all the Achæans alike Δευκαλίδαι. We may
6161,SECT. III.,"therefore safely conclude at least, that Homer knew of no Deucalion"
6162,SECT. III.,other than the son of Minos.
6163,SECT. III.,
6164,SECT. III.,_Of Rhadamanthus and the Phæacians._
6165,SECT. III.,
6166,SECT. III.,"We come now to Rhadamanthus, who is thrice mentioned by Homer."
6167,SECT. III.,"Once[301], as born of the same parents with Minos[302]. Once, as"
6168,SECT. III.,enjoying like him honours from Jupiter beyond the term of our
6169,SECT. III.,ordinary human life: for he is placed amidst the calm and comforts
6170,SECT. III.,of the Elysian plain. The third passage is remarkable. It is where
6171,SECT. III.,"Alcinous[303] promises Ulysses conveyance to his home, even should"
6172,SECT. III.,"it be farther than Eubœa, which the Phæacian mariners consider to be"
6173,SECT. III.,"their farthest known point of distance, and whither they had conveyed"
6174,SECT. III.,"Rhadamanthus,"
6175,SECT. III.,
6176,SECT. III.,"ἐποψόμενον Τίτυον, Γαιήιον υἱόν·"
6177,SECT. III.,
6178,SECT. III.,"on his way to visit, or inspect, or look after, Tityus. This Tityus we"
6179,SECT. III.,find in the νεκυία suffering torture for having attempted violence upon
6180,SECT. III.,"Latona[304], as she was proceeding towards Pytho, through Panopeus."
6181,SECT. III.,"Panopeus was a place in Phocis, on the borders of Bœotia, and on the"
6182,SECT. III.,line of any one journeying between Delos and Delphi.
6183,SECT. III.,
6184,SECT. III.,"There is in this legend the geographical indistinctness, and even"
6185,SECT. III.,"confusion, which we commonly find where Homer dealt with places lying"
6186,SECT. III.,in the least beyond the range of his own experience or that of his
6187,SECT. III.,"hearers, as was the case with Phæacia. If Tityus was in Panopeus, the"
6188,SECT. III.,proper way to carry Rhadamanthus was by the Corinthian gulf. But from
6189,SECT. III.,"various points in the geography of the Odyssey, it may, in my opinion,"
6190,SECT. III.,"be gathered, that Homer had an idea, quite vague and indeterminate as"
6191,SECT. III.,"to distance, of a connection by sea between the north of the Adriatic,"
6192,SECT. III.,"and the north of the Ægean, either directly, or from the sea of"
6193,SECT. III.,"Marmora: and it suited his representation of the Phæacians, and best"
6194,SECT. III.,"maintained their as it were aerial character, to give them an unknown"
6195,SECT. III.,"rather than a known route. However that might be, if we look into"
6196,SECT. III.,"the legend in order to conjecture its historic basis, it appears to"
6197,SECT. III.,suggest the inferences which follow:
6198,SECT. III.,
6199,SECT. III.,"1. That according to tradition, the empire or supremacy of Minos, which"
6200,SECT. III.,"may in some points have resembled that afterwards held by Agamemnon,"
6201,SECT. III.,"embraced both Corcyra and likewise middle Greece, where Panopeus and"
6202,SECT. III.,Pytho or Delphi lay.
6203,SECT. III.,
6204,SECT. III.,"We must, however, presume the empire of Minos to have been in great"
6205,SECT. III.,"part insular. There were contemporary kingdoms on the mainland, which"
6206,SECT. III.,give no sign of dependence upon it.
6207,SECT. III.,
6208,SECT. III.,2. That the Phæacians acted as subjects of Minos in carrying
6209,SECT. III.,Rhadamanthus by sea from one part of the dominions of that king to
6210,SECT. III.,another.
6211,SECT. III.,
6212,SECT. III.,3. That Rhadamanthus went to punish Tityus as an offender within the
6213,SECT. III.,"realm of Minos, and did this on the part and in lieu of Minos himself."
6214,SECT. III.,
6215,SECT. III.,"4. That though he was not Greek by birth, his person, and family, and"
6216,SECT. III.,empire were all Greek in the view of Homer.
6217,SECT. III.,
6218,SECT. III.,This conjectural interpretation of the legend derives support from many
6219,SECT. III.,quarters.
6220,SECT. III.,
6221,SECT. III.,"It is in thorough harmony, as to the extended rule of Minos, with the"
6222,SECT. III.,"Eleventh Odyssey, which represents Minos as acting in the capacity of"
6223,SECT. III.,"a sovereign in the shades below; which also exhibits, as suffering"
6224,SECT. III.,"judicially the punishments that he awarded, offenders connected with"
6225,SECT. III.,"various portions of Greek territory, and among them this very Tityus."
6226,SECT. III.,
6227,SECT. III.,_Minos: post-Homeric tradition._
6228,SECT. III.,
6229,SECT. III.,It is now time to look to the post-Homeric traditions.
6230,SECT. III.,
6231,SECT. III.,The extent of the sway of Minos is supported by the tradition of
6232,SECT. III.,"Pelasgus, in the Supplices of Æschylus[305], which represents the"
6233,SECT. III.,whole country from (probably) Macedonia to the extreme south of the
6234,SECT. III.,"peninsula, as having been formerly under one and the same sway. The"
6235,SECT. III.,empire of Minos may have been magnified into this tradition.
6236,SECT. III.,
6237,SECT. III.,The authority of Thucydides is available for the following
6238,SECT. III.,points[306]:--
6239,SECT. III.,
6240,SECT. III.,1. That Minos was the earliest known possessor of maritime power:
6241,SECT. III.,"thus harmonising with the hypothesis that the Phæacians, whose great"
6242,SECT. III.,"distinction was in their nautical character, were acting as his"
6243,SECT. III.,subjects when they carried Rhadamanthus.
6244,SECT. III.,
6245,SECT. III.,"2. That his power extended over the Grecian sea, or Ægean (Ἑλληνικὴ"
6246,SECT. III.,θάλασσα) generally (ἐπὶ πλεῖστον); thus indicating a great extent of
6247,SECT. III.,sway.
6248,SECT. III.,
6249,SECT. III.,3. That he appointed his children to govern his dominions on his behalf
6250,SECT. III.,(τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ παῖδας ἡγεμόνας ἐγκαταστήσας): which supports the idea
6251,SECT. III.,that his brother Rhadamanthus may have acted for him at a distance.
6252,SECT. III.,
6253,SECT. III.,4. That he drove the Carians out of the islands of the Ægean. This
6254,SECT. III.,"statement receives remarkable confirmation from Homer, who makes the"
6255,SECT. III.,islands up to the very coast of Caria contributors to the force of the
6256,SECT. III.,"Greek army: while Lesbos and others, situated farther north, and more"
6257,SECT. III.,"distant from Crete, appear to have been, like Caria itself, in the"
6258,SECT. III.,Trojan interest.
6259,SECT. III.,
6260,SECT. III.,In the Minos ascribed to Plato[307] we find the tradition of his direct
6261,SECT. III.,"relations with Attica, which were well known to the theatre. This"
6262,SECT. III.,supports the notice in Homer of the marriage contracted between Theseus
6263,SECT. III.,and his daughter Ariadne.
6264,SECT. III.,
6265,SECT. III.,"Aristotle[308], like Thucydides, asserts the maritime power of Minos"
6266,SECT. III.,"and his sovereignty over the islands, and adds, that he lost or ended"
6267,SECT. III.,his life in the course of an expedition to conquer Sicily[309].
6268,SECT. III.,
6269,SECT. III.,"Herodotus[310], like Thucydides, treats Minos as the first known"
6270,SECT. III.,"sovereign who had been powerful by sea. He states, that Minos expelled"
6271,SECT. III.,"his brother Sarpedon from Crete, and that Sarpedon with his adherents"
6272,SECT. III.,"colonised Lycia, which was governed, down to the time of the historian"
6273,SECT. III.,"himself, by laws partly Cretan[311]: and he also delivers the tradition"
6274,SECT. III.,"that Minos was slain in an expedition against Sicily at Camicus,"
6275,SECT. III.,afterwards Agrigentum. A town bearing his name remained long after in
6276,SECT. III.,the island.
6277,SECT. III.,
6278,SECT. III.,Euripides laid the scene of his Rhadamanthus in Bœotia: and a Cretan

6287,SECT. III.,"in combination with the admission always made by the Lacedæmonians,"
6288,SECT. III.,"that their lawgiver Lycurgus initiated the Cretan institutions[315],"
6289,SECT. III.,"and with the universal Greek tradition that in Crete, first of all"
6290,SECT. III.,"parts of Greece, laws and a regular polity had been established by"
6291,SECT. III.,"Minos. Again, in the Dialogue printed among the works of Plato, the"
6292,SECT. III.,author of it seeks to establish the fundamental idea of law: puts aside
6293,SECT. III.,the injurious statements of the tragedians who represented Minos as
6294,SECT. III.,"a tyrant, declares his laws to have been the oldest and the best in"
6295,SECT. III.,"Greece, and the models from which the prime parts of the Laconian"
6296,SECT. III.,legislation had been borrowed[316].
6297,SECT. III.,
6298,SECT. III.,Among the resemblances known to us appear to be
6299,SECT. III.,
6300,SECT. III.,1. The division between the military and the agricultural part of the
6301,SECT. III.,community.
6302,SECT. III.,
6303,SECT. III.,"2. The περίοικοι of Crete, holding the same relation to the Cretans, as"
6304,SECT. III.,"the Helots to the Spartans, and like them cultivating the land."
6305,SECT. III.,
6306,SECT. III.,3. The institution of συσσίτια in both countries.
6307,SECT. III.,
6308,SECT. III.,4. The organism of the government: the five ephors corresponding with
6309,SECT. III.,"the ten κοσμοὶ of Crete, and the βουλὴ being alike in both."
6310,SECT. III.,
6311,SECT. III.,There also still remain etymological indications that Minos was the
6312,SECT. III.,"person who raised some tribe or class to preeminence in Crete, and"
6313,SECT. III.,depressed some other tribes or classes below the level of the free
6314,SECT. III.,"community. In Hesychius we read,"
6315,SECT. III.,
6316,SECT. III.,"μνοῖα, οἰκετεία."
6317,SECT. III.,
6318,SECT. III.,"μνῆτοι, δοῦλοι."
6319,SECT. III.,
6320,SECT. III.,"μνῶα, δουλεία."
6321,SECT. III.,
6322,SECT. III.,"And Athenæus quotes from the Cretica of Sosicrates, τὴν μὲν κοινὴν"
6323,SECT. III.,δουλείαν οἱ Κρῆτες καλοῦσι μνοίαν· τὴν δὲ ἰδίαν ἀφαμιώτας· τοὺς δὲ
6324,SECT. III.,"περιοίκους, ὑπηκόους[317]. He also says, that, according to Ephorus,"
6325,SECT. III.,"the general name for slave in Crete was κλαρώτης, and that it was"
6326,SECT. III.,derived from the custom of apportioning the slaves by lot. This
6327,SECT. III.,remarkably fixes the character of Cretan slavery as owing its rise
6328,SECT. III.,"to some institutions public in the highest sense, for merely private"
6329,SECT. III.,"slavery could not, it would appear, have had an origin such as to"
6330,SECT. III.,account for the name. It thus indirectly supports the idea implied in
6331,SECT. III.,"μνοία and μνῆτοι, that it was derived from Minos. Athenæus[318] again,"
6332,SECT. III.,"quoting the _Creticæ glossæ_ of Hermon, gives us the words μνώτας,"
6333,SECT. III.,"τοὺς εὐγενεῖς (otherwise read ἐγγενεῖς) οἰκέτας, and thus pointing to"
6334,SECT. III.,the reduction to servitude of some of the previously free population of
6335,SECT. III.,the country.
6336,SECT. III.,
6337,SECT. III.,There can be little doubt that it was the Pelasgic part of the
6338,SECT. III.,population which thus succumbed before the more active elements of
6339,SECT. III.,"Cretan society, and which continued in the manual occupation of"
6340,SECT. III.,"husbandry, while war, policy, and maritime pursuits became the lot of"
6341,SECT. III.,their more fortunate competitors. For is it difficult to divine which
6342,SECT. III.,"were those more active elements, since Homer points out for us among"
6343,SECT. III.,"the inhabitants of Crete at least two tribes, the Achæans and the"
6344,SECT. III.,"Dorians, of Hellic origin. Bishop Thirlwall points also to a Phœnician"
6345,SECT. III.,"element in Crete, and to Homer as indicating the Phœnician origin of"
6346,SECT. III.,"Minos. This is suggested not only by his birth, and by his maritime"
6347,SECT. III.,"preeminence, but by Homer’s placing Dædalus in Crete[319]. For that"
6348,SECT. III.,name directly establishes a connection with the arts that made Sidon
6349,SECT. III.,"and Phœnicia so famous. The later tradition, indeed, places Dædalus"
6350,SECT. III.,"personally in relations with Minos, as having been pursued by him after"
6351,SECT. III.,he had fled to Sicily[320].
6352,SECT. III.,
6353,SECT. III.,Elsewhere I have shown reason for supposing that a second of the
6354,SECT. III.,"five Cretan nations, namely, the Κύδωνες, was Pelasgian: and there"
6355,SECT. III.,"is a curious tradition, which supports this hypothesis. According to"
6356,SECT. III.,"Ephorus[321], there were solemn festivals of the slave population,"
6357,SECT. III.,"during which freemen were not permitted to enter within the walls,"
6358,SECT. III.,"while the slaves were supreme, and had the right of flogging the free;"
6359,SECT. III.,"and these festivals were held in Cydonia, the city of these Κύδωνες."
6360,SECT. III.,
6361,SECT. III.,"Our belief in a Cretan empire of Minos, founded on the evidence of"
6362,SECT. III.,"the Poems, and sustained by the statement of Thucydides, need not"
6363,SECT. III.,be impaired by the fact that we find little post-Homeric evidence
6364,SECT. III.,directly available for its support. In early times the recollection of
6365,SECT. III.,dynasties very much depended on the interest which their successors
6366,SECT. III.,had in keeping it alive. Now the Minoan empire was already reduced to
6367,SECT. III.,fragments at the time of the _Troica_. The supremacy over Greece was
6368,SECT. III.,then in the hands of a family that held the throne of the Perseids and
6369,SECT. III.,"the Danaids, a throne older than that of Minos himself, though in his"
6370,SECT. III.,time probably less distinguished: a throne whose lustre would have
6371,SECT. III.,been diminished by a lively tradition of his power and greatness. And
6372,SECT. III.,it was from the Pelopids that the Dorian sovereigns of Sparta claimed
6373,SECT. III.,"to inherit. Therefore the great Greek sovereignty, from the _Troica_"
6374,SECT. III.,"onwards, had no interest in cherishing the recollection of this ancient"
6375,SECT. III.,"part of history; on the contrary, their interest lay in depressing"
6376,SECT. III.,"it; and under these circumstances we need not wonder that, until the"
6377,SECT. III.,"inquiring age of Greek literature and philosophy, when Athens gained"
6378,SECT. III.,"the predominance, the traces of it should have remained but faint. But"
6379,SECT. III.,the traces of Cretans have been found extensively dispersed both over
6380,SECT. III.,"the islands, and on the coasts of the Ægean[322]."
6381,SECT. III.,
6382,SECT. III.,_The Lycians._
6383,SECT. III.,
6384,SECT. III.,"To complete the statement of this part of the case, it is necessary to"
6385,SECT. III.,"turn to another country, holding, with its inhabitants, a very peculiar"
6386,SECT. III.,position in the Iliad. The attentive reader of the poem must often
6387,SECT. III.,"inquire, with curiosity and wonder, why it is that Homer everywhere"
6388,SECT. III.,"follows the Lycian name with favour so marked, that it may almost be"
6389,SECT. III.,"called favouritism. At every turn, which brings that people into view,"
6390,SECT. III.,we are met by the clearest indications of it: and few of Homer’s
6391,SECT. III.,"indications, none of his marked indications, are without a cause and an"
6392,SECT. III.,aim.
6393,SECT. III.,
6394,SECT. III.,"Sarpedon, the Lycian commander in chief, performs the greatest"
6395,SECT. III.,military exploit on the Trojan side that is to be found throughout
6396,SECT. III.,the poems[323]. That he does not obscure the eminence of Hector is
6397,SECT. III.,"only owing to the fact, that his share in the action of the poem is"
6398,SECT. III.,"smaller, not to its being less distinguished. Everywhere he plays his"
6399,SECT. III.,"part with a faultless valour, a valour set off by his modesty, and by"
6400,SECT. III.,his keen sense of public duty according to the strictest meaning of the
6401,SECT. III.,"term[324]; Jupiter, his father, sheds tears of blood for his coming"
6402,SECT. III.,death; and he is in truth the most perfect as well as the bravest man
6403,SECT. III.,"on the Trojan side. Glaucus, his second in command, is inferior to no"
6404,SECT. III.,"Trojan warrior save Hector, though in the exchange of the arms with"
6405,SECT. III.,"Diomed Homer has, as usual, reserved the superiority to the Grecian"
6406,SECT. III.,intellect.
6407,SECT. III.,
6408,SECT. III.,The distinctions awarded to the Lycian people are in full proportion
6409,SECT. III.,to those of their king Sarpedon. They formed one only among the eleven
6410,SECT. III.,"divisions of the auxiliary force, but the Lycian[325] name, and theirs"
6411,SECT. III.,"only[326], evidently on account of their eminence, is often used to"
6412,SECT. III.,signify the entire body. In the great assault on the Greek trench and
6413,SECT. III.,"rampart, Sarpedon their leader commands all the allies, and chooses as"
6414,SECT. III.,"his lieutenants Glaucus, and Asteropæus a Pæonian, but not the Pæonian"
6415,SECT. III.,general[327]. They are never mentioned with any epithet except of
6416,SECT. III.,"honour: and to them is applied the term ἀντίθεοι[328], which is given"
6417,SECT. III.,"to no other tribe or nation in the Iliad, and in the Odyssey only to"
6418,SECT. III.,the Phæacians[329]; to these last it appertains doubtless on account
6419,SECT. III.,of their relationship to the immortals. The Lycian attack in the
6420,SECT. III.,"Twelfth Book is the one really formidable to the Greeks[330], and in"
6421,SECT. III.,"the rout of the Sixteenth Book we are told, that ‘not even the stalwart"
6422,SECT. III.,(ἴφθιμοι) Lycians’ held their ground after the death of Sarpedon[331].
6423,SECT. III.,They alone are appealed to in the name of that peculiar and sacred
6424,SECT. III.,"sentiment of military honour called αἰδὼς, which, with this single"
6425,SECT. III.,"exception, seems to be the exclusive property of the Greeks[332]."
6426,SECT. III.,
6427,SECT. III.,"It is difficult to account for this glowing representation, so"
6428,SECT. III.,"consistently carried through the poem, except upon the supposition,"
6429,SECT. III.,that Homer regarded the Lycians as having some peculiar affinity or
6430,SECT. III.,other relation with the Greeks; and that he on this account raised
6431,SECT. III.,them out of what would otherwise more naturally have been a secondary
6432,SECT. III.,position.
6433,SECT. III.,
6434,SECT. III.,"There are many signs of a specific kind, that this was actually his"
6435,SECT. III.,view of them.
6436,SECT. III.,
6437,SECT. III.,1. To make Sarpedon the son of Jupiter was at once to establish some
6438,SECT. III.,relationship with the Greek races.
6439,SECT. III.,
6440,SECT. III.,"2. The legend of Bellerophon, delivered on the field of battle, was"
6441,SECT. III.,"not required, nor is it introduced, merely to fill up the time during"
6442,SECT. III.,which Hector goes from the camp to the city. It required no filling
6443,SECT. III.,up: but Homer turns the interval to account by using it to give us
6444,SECT. III.,"this interesting chapter of archaic history, doubtless in order to"
6445,SECT. III.,"illustrate, as all his other legends do, the beginnings and early"
6446,SECT. III.,"relations of the Hellenic races. Accordingly we find that Antea, wife"
6447,SECT. III.,"of Prœtus the Argive king, was a Lycian: that a familiar intercourse"
6448,SECT. III.,"subsisted between the two courts, such as probably and strongly implies"
6449,SECT. III.,that the nations had other ties: and lastly that an Æolid line of
6450,SECT. III.,"sovereigns, descended through Sisyphus, were the actual governors of"
6451,SECT. III.,Lycia at the period of the _Troica_.
6452,SECT. III.,
6453,SECT. III.,"3. The very same ideas of kingship and its offices, which prevailed"
6454,SECT. III.,"in Greece, are expressed by Sarpedon in his speech to Glaucus[333],"
6455,SECT. III.,and there is an indication of free institutions which enlarges the
6456,SECT. III.,resemblance. The force of this circumstance will be more fully
6457,SECT. III.,"appreciated, when we shall have examined the Asiatic tinge which is"
6458,SECT. III.,perceptible in the institutions of Troy itself.
6459,SECT. III.,
6460,SECT. III.,"4. Besides the Æolid sovereignty, the etymology of the names of Lycian"
6461,SECT. III.,"warriors connects itself not only with the Greek race, but with the"
6462,SECT. III.,Hellic element in that race[334].
6463,SECT. III.,
6464,SECT. III.,"5. On the other hand Apollo, whom we shall hereafter find to be the"
6465,SECT. III.,"great Pelasgian, though also universal, god, is even, according to"
6466,SECT. III.,"Homer, in close and peculiar connection with Lycia, although he is"
6467,SECT. III.,not localized there by Homer as he is in the later tradition. First
6468,SECT. III.,as being λυκηγενής. Secondly as the great bowman: while Lycia was so
6469,SECT. III.,"eminent in this art, that Æneas, addressing Pandarus with a compliment"
6470,SECT. III.,"on his skill, says no man before Troy can match him, and perhaps even"
6471,SECT. III.,"in Lycia there may not be a better archer[335]. Thirdly, this Pandarus"
6472,SECT. III.,"the archer, and son of Lycaon, received the gift of his bow from Apollo"
6473,SECT. III.,"himself[336]: and says, that Apollo prompted or instructed him, as"
6474,SECT. III.,"he came from Lycia[337]. It may, however, be reasonably questioned,"
6475,SECT. III.,"whether we are here to understand the Lycia of the South, or the"
6476,SECT. III.,"district of kindred name in Troas. In any case, Apollo in Lycia would"
6477,SECT. III.,be no more than the counterpart of Minerva in Pelasgian Athens.
6478,SECT. III.,
6479,SECT. III.,"6. The prevalence of that Lycian name in other quarters, such as"
6480,SECT. III.,"Arcadia, of a marked Pelasgian character, further supports the"
6481,SECT. III.,supposition that Lycia had probably a Pelasgian race for the bulk of
6482,SECT. III.,"its population, holding the same subordinate relation to another race"
6483,SECT. III.,as we find in corresponding cases. In Arcadia[338] Pausanias reports a
6484,SECT. III.,"Lycaon son of Pelasgus; a Lycosura, the city he founded; Lyceon, the"
6485,SECT. III.,"hill where it stood; and Lycea, the games he established."
6486,SECT. III.,
6487,SECT. III.,All this evidence combines to show some correspondence between Lycia
6488,SECT. III.,"and Greece, as to the constituent elements of the population. The"
6489,SECT. III.,agreement could not have been perfect: for the records of the Lycian
6490,SECT. III.,"language, I believe, show a prevalence of other elements than the"
6491,SECT. III.,"Greek. But we have thus a reason to suppose, that the community of"
6492,SECT. III.,architecture and other arts which has been found to subsist between the
6493,SECT. III.,"two countries, was not merely dependent on later colonisation, but was"
6494,SECT. III.,owing to an affinity of races and similarity of manners which dates
6495,SECT. III.,from the heroic age.
6496,SECT. III.,
6497,SECT. III.,"Lastly, the fragments of Homeric evidence respecting the Lycians are"
6498,SECT. III.,"combined by a later tradition, which links them to Crete, the main"
6499,SECT. III.,"subject of our recent inquiry. According to this tradition, there was a"
6500,SECT. III.,"Sarpedon earlier than the Sarpedon of the _Troica_, who, besides being"
6501,SECT. III.,"son of Jupiter, was brother to Minos. He is said to have been expelled,"
6502,SECT. III.,"with his adherents, by that sovereign from Crete; to have repaired to"
6503,SECT. III.,"Lycia, and to have colonised that country, or a part of it. In the"
6504,SECT. III.,"time of Herodotus, as we have seen, it retained laws of Cretan, that"
6505,SECT. III.,"is to say of Greek, origin. And at two later periods of its history,"
6506,SECT. III.,"far remote from Homer and from one another, its inhabitants signalised"
6507,SECT. III.,"themselves by the most desperate valour in defence of Xanthus, its"
6508,SECT. III.,capital[339].
6509,SECT. III.,
6510,SECT. III.,"For the origin of the group of names, having Λύκος or some similar"
6511,SECT. III.,"word for their root, it seems most natural to infer its identity with"
6512,SECT. III.,"the Latin _lucus_, essentially the same with _lupus_, and to presume"
6513,SECT. III.,"that it had a Pelasgic source, but that the word corresponding with"
6514,SECT. III.,"it, probably Λύκος, meaning a wood or grove, had become obsolete in"
6515,SECT. III.,the later Hellenic tongue. There is every reason for a supposition of
6516,SECT. III.,"this kind, as these words, etymologically connected, evidently hang"
6517,SECT. III.,"round some common centre, which centre has reference to primitive and"
6518,SECT. III.,"to Pelasgic life, as well as to the somewhat specially Pelasgic deity"
6519,SECT. III.,Apollo. Nor is it strange that the root of a name associated with the
6520,SECT. III.,"Pelasgi should have been lost to the Greek tongue, while the name"
6521,SECT. III.,itself remains: we have another example in Larissa.
6522,SECT. III.,
6523,SECT. III.,"But if there was such a word, with such a meaning, the link, which"
6524,SECT. III.,"may perhaps connect it with Pelasgic life, is evident. For the first"
6525,SECT. III.,"agricultural settlers must often be, as such, in a greater or less"
6526,SECT. III.,"degree, dwellers in woods. It may be said that in the United States,"
6527,SECT. III.,"at the present day, the proper name for an agricultural settler is"
6528,SECT. III.,"‘backwoodsman.’ In British colonies of Australia, they, who pass beyond"
6529,SECT. III.,"the limits of existing settlement, in order to extend it, are said to"
6530,SECT. III.,go into the bush. Thus the idea at the root of the Lycian name is in
6531,SECT. III.,"all probability twin, or rather elder brother, to that which properly"
6532,SECT. III.,would indicate the agricultural settler.
6533,SECT. III.,
6534,SECT. III.,"It is however plain, that we cannot look to any thing simply Pelasgian"
6535,SECT. III.,"in the Lycian population, as supplying the motive which has induced"
6536,SECT. III.,"Homer to give the Lycians a marked preference over other populations,"
6537,SECT. III.,themselves of a Pelasgian character. This preference must be due to
6538,SECT. III.,"the other element, which associates them especially with the Hellenic"
6539,SECT. III.,race. And we may not irrationally suppose it to be founded on any one
6540,SECT. III.,of such causes as these: the special connection in the royal line
6541,SECT. III.,between the two countries: a larger infusion of the more lordly blood
6542,SECT. III.,"into a subordinate Lelegian or Pelasgian body in Lycia, just as in"
6543,SECT. III.,"Greece, than in Troas and Asia Minor generally: or lastly, a more"
6544,SECT. III.,palpable and near connection between the dominant caste in Lycia and
6545,SECT. III.,"those Persian highlanders, from among whom may have proceeded[340]"
6546,SECT. III.,the forefathers of the Hellenic tribes. Everywhere we see this race
6547,SECT. III.,"branching forth, and, by an intrinsic superiority, acquiring a"
6548,SECT. III.,predominance over the races in prior occupation. Whether the stock came
6549,SECT. III.,"to Lycia by land, or from the eastern coast of the Mediterranean, it"
6550,SECT. III.,may be hard even to conjecture: but there is one particular note of
6551,SECT. III.,"relationship to Persia, which Lycia retains more clearly than Greece,"
6552,SECT. III.,"and that is the high estimation in which, to judge from the connection"
6553,SECT. III.,"with Apollo and from Il. v. 172, the use of the bow was held in that"
6554,SECT. III.,"country. The case was the same in Persia. According to Herodotus, one"
6555,SECT. III.,of the three essential articles of education in Persia was the use of
6556,SECT. III.,"the bow[341]; and he is not contradicted by Ctesias, who calls him in"
6557,SECT. III.,"most things a liar and a fabulist[342]. We must not, indeed, rely too"
6558,SECT. III.,strongly upon a circumstance like this. Cyaxares the Median had the
6559,SECT. III.,art taught to his sons by Nomad Scythians[343]. We may however observe
6560,SECT. III.,that alike on the Trojan and the Grecian side we never hear of the
6561,SECT. III.,"bow except in the hands of highborn persons, such as Paris, Pandarus,"
6562,SECT. III.,"Teucer: and, in the games, Meriones[344]."
6563,SECT. III.,
6564,SECT. III.,"In passing, it may deserve remark, that the Lycians alone, of all"
6565,SECT. III.,"tribes or nations on either side, appear not under two leaders merely,"
6566,SECT. III.,"but two kings, in the strict sense. I do not however believe that this"
6567,SECT. III.,indicates a political peculiarity. The origin of it may probably be
6568,SECT. III.,"found in the legend of Bellerophon, to whom, after his high exploits"
6569,SECT. III.,"and great services, the reigning sovereign gave half his kingdom[345]."
6570,SECT. III.,Now that king is nowhere stated to have had a son: and if we suppose a
6571,SECT. III.,"failure of issue in his own direct line, and the succession of one of"
6572,SECT. III.,"the two descendants of his daughter to each moiety of the realm, it at"
6573,SECT. III.,once accounts for the exceptional position of Sarpedon and Glaucus.
6574,SECT. III.,
6575,SECT. III.,"The suppositions then towards which we are led are, that Minos was of"
6576,SECT. III.,"Phœnician origin, that he came to Crete and acquired the sovereignty,"
6577,SECT. III.,"that he ruled over a mixed population of Cretans, Pelasgians, and"
6578,SECT. III.,"Hellic tribes, that he organised the country and established an"
6579,SECT. III.,"extended supremacy, especially maritime and insular, beyond its"
6580,SECT. III.,limits; which however we must not consider as involving the consistent
6581,SECT. III.,"maintenance of sovereignty according to modern ideas, and which is"
6582,SECT. III.,in no degree inconsistent with the rule of Danaids or Perseids in
6583,SECT. III.,"Peloponnesus. Lastly, that in giving form to his social institutions,"
6584,SECT. III.,"he depressed the Pelasgian element of Cretan society, and laid, in"
6585,SECT. III.,"political depression, the foundations of their subsequent servitude."
6586,SECT. III.,
6587,SECT. III.,_Cyprus._
6588,SECT. III.,
6589,SECT. III.,"If this be so, it is worth while further to observe, that there are"
6590,SECT. III.,"traces of a somewhat analogous history in Cyprus, another acknowledged"
6591,SECT. III.,"stepping-stone, according to Homer[346], between Greece and the East."
6592,SECT. III.,
6593,SECT. III.,"In the Seventeenth Book of the Odyssey[347], Ulysses, in one of his"
6594,SECT. III.,"fictitious narrations, states to the Suitors, that the Egyptians, who"
6595,SECT. III.,"had taken him prisoner and reduced him to slavery, then made a present"
6596,SECT. III.,"of him to their ξεῖνος Dmetor, a descendant of Iasus, who ruled ‘with"
6597,SECT. III.,"might,’ that is, with considerable power over Cyprus (ὃς Κύπρου ἶφι"
6598,SECT. III.,ἄνασσεν); the same expression as he uses in the Eleventh Book with
6599,SECT. III.,"respect to Amphion, the Iasid, in Orchomenus. From all we know of the"
6600,SECT. III.,"Iasian name[348], it may be inferred that this was a Pelasgian dynasty,"
6601,SECT. III.,"and if so, then without doubt that it ruled over a Pelasgian people."
6602,SECT. III.,
6603,SECT. III.,Ulysses does not mention the time of this transaction; and it must be
6604,SECT. III.,"remembered, that he spoke in the character of an aged person, so that"
6605,SECT. III.,"the scene might be laid (so to speak) thirty or forty years back, and"
6606,SECT. III.,therefore long before the expedition to Troy.
6607,SECT. III.,
6608,SECT. III.,"But in the Eleventh Book of the Iliad[349], we find Agamemnon putting"
6609,SECT. III.,"on a breastplate, which was evidently a marvel of workmanship, with"
6610,SECT. III.,"its plates on plates of different metals, and its six dragons flashing"
6611,SECT. III.,"forth the colours of the rainbow. Now we must observe, first, that this"
6612,SECT. III.,was evidently meant to be understood as a Sidonian or Phœnician work:
6613,SECT. III.,"secondly, that it was presented to Agamemnon by Cinyres of Cyprus, to"
6614,SECT. III.,"conciliate his favour (--χαριζόμενος βασιλῆï, perhaps we might render"
6615,SECT. III.,"it, to win the favour of _his_ king--) upon the occasion of his hearing"
6616,SECT. III.,that the king was collecting an armament against Troy. That is to
6617,SECT. III.,"say, it was to compound with him for not appearing in person to join"
6618,SECT. III.,the Greek forces. Here then we must infer that there was some vague
6619,SECT. III.,"allegiance, which was due, or which at least might be claimed, from"
6620,SECT. III.,"Cyprus to Agamemnon, under the πολλῇσιν νήσοισι[350]."
6621,SECT. III.,
6622,SECT. III.,Now we know nothing of the Pelopids before the _Troica_ as conquerors:
6623,SECT. III.,"and especially, it would be difficult to apply the supposition that"
6624,SECT. III.,they were such in relation to a place so distant. Therefore the
6625,SECT. III.,"political connection, whatever it may have been, could probably rest"
6626,SECT. III.,"upon an ethnical affinity alone; and, as we know nothing of any Hellic"
6627,SECT. III.,"element in this quarter, that affinity seems to presume the Pelasgian"
6628,SECT. III.,"character of the population. The inference, which may thus be drawn,"
6629,SECT. III.,coincides with that already suggested by the name of Iasus.
6630,SECT. III.,
6631,SECT. III.,We may however justly be curious to learn what conditions they were
6632,SECT. III.,"which gave to Cinyres, and so far as we know to Cinyres alone, among"
6633,SECT. III.,"princes, this very peculiar attitude at a critical juncture. It is"
6634,SECT. III.,"obvious, that in proportion as his situation was remote from the Greek"
6635,SECT. III.,"rendezvous, and from the scene of action, the service became more"
6636,SECT. III.,"burdensome: but on the other hand, in proportion as he was distant"
6637,SECT. III.,"from the centre of Achæan power, he was little likely to be coerced."
6638,SECT. III.,How comes it then that Agamemnon had over Cinyres an influence which
6639,SECT. III.,he does not seem to have possessed over the tribes of Macedonia and
6640,SECT. III.,"Thrace, though these lay nearer both to him, and to the way between him"
6641,SECT. III.,"and the Troad, which he had to traverse by sea?"
6642,SECT. III.,
6643,SECT. III.,"The hypothesis, that the population of Cyprus was purely or generally"
6644,SECT. III.,"Pelasgian, appears to square remarkably with the facts. For then, upon"
6645,SECT. III.,"the one hand, they would naturally be disinclined to interfere on"
6646,SECT. III.,behalf of the Greeks in a war where all purely Pelasgian sympathies
6647,SECT. III.,would (as we must for the present take for granted) incline them
6648,SECT. III.,towards Troy.
6649,SECT. III.,
6650,SECT. III.,"But further, we find among other notes of the Pelasgians this, that"
6651,SECT. III.,"they were characterised by a want of nautical genius, while the more"
6652,SECT. III.,"enterprising character of the Hellenes at once made them, and has kept"
6653,SECT. III.,"them down to this very day, an eminently maritime people; and Homer"
6654,SECT. III.,"himself, with his whole soul, evidently gloried and delighted in the"
6655,SECT. III.,"sea. If then the population of Cyprus was Pelasgian, we can readily"
6656,SECT. III.,"understand how, notwithstanding its sympathies and its remoteness,"
6657,SECT. III.,it might be worth the while of its ruler to propitiate Agamemnon
6658,SECT. III.,by a valuable gift in order to avert a visit which his ships might
6659,SECT. III.,"otherwise be expected to pay; and how the Pelopid power over Cyprus,"
6660,SECT. III.,"as an island, might be greater than over nearer tribes, which were"
6661,SECT. III.,continental.
6662,SECT. III.,
6663,SECT. III.,"It may aid us to comprehend the relation between Cyprus and Agamemnon,"
6664,SECT. III.,if we call to recollection the insular empire which Athens afterwards
6665,SECT. III.,acquired.
6666,SECT. III.,
6667,SECT. III.,"There is another sign, which strongly tends to connect Cyprus with"
6668,SECT. III.,"the Pelasgian races, especially those which belong to Asia. It is the"
6669,SECT. III.,"worship of Venus, who had in that island her especial sanctuary, and"
6670,SECT. III.,"who, upon her detection in the Odyssey[351], takes refuge there. In"
6671,SECT. III.,"the war, she is keenly interested on the Trojan side: and the Trojan"
6672,SECT. III.,"history is too plainly marked with the influence of the idea, that"
6673,SECT. III.,exalted her to Olympian rank. That Venus was known mythologically among
6674,SECT. III.,"the Hellenic tribes, we see from the lay of Demodocus. That she was"
6675,SECT. III.,"worshipped among them, seems to be rendered extremely improbable by the"
6676,SECT. III.,"fact, that Diomed wounds her in his ἀριστεῖα[352]. We must consider"
6677,SECT. III.,"her as a peculiarly, and perhaps in Homer’s time almost exclusively"
6678,SECT. III.,Pelasgian deity; and her local abode at Paphos may be taken as a marked
6679,SECT. III.,"sign, accordingly, of the Pelasgianism of Cyprus."
6680,SECT. III.,
6681,SECT. III.,"We have already seen Agapenor, a stranger, placed by Agamemnon in"
6682,SECT. III.,"command of the Pelasgian forces of Arcadia; and Minos, a stranger,"
6683,SECT. III.,"acquire dominion over the partially, and perhaps mainly, Pelasgian"
6684,SECT. III.,"population of Crete. It seems probable, that Cyprus in this too"
6685,SECT. III.,affords us a parallel. We have the following considerations to guide
6686,SECT. III.,"us in the question. First, the Pelasgians, not being a maritime, were"
6687,SECT. III.,"consequently not a mercantile people. Secondly, from the description"
6688,SECT. III.,"of the gift sent by Cinyres, we must understand it, on account of"
6689,SECT. III.,"the preciousness of its materials and its ornaments, to have been"
6690,SECT. III.,a first rate example of the skill of the workers in metal of the
6691,SECT. III.,"period. Such things were not produced by Pelasgians; and we must, to"
6692,SECT. III.,"be consistent with all the other Homeric indications, suppose this"
6693,SECT. III.,breastplate to have been of Sidonian or Phœnician workmanship. This
6694,SECT. III.,"supposition connects Cinyres himself with Phœnicia, while his people"
6695,SECT. III.,"were Pelasgian. Again, on examining his name we find in it no Pelasgian"
6696,SECT. III.,"characteristics; but it appears to be Asiatic, and to signify a musical"
6697,SECT. III.,"instrument with strings, which was used in Asia[353]. All this makes it"
6698,SECT. III.,"likely, upon Homeric presumptions, that he was a Phœnician, or a person"
6699,SECT. III.,"of Phœnician connections, and that into his hands the old Pelasgic"
6700,SECT. III.,"sovereignty of Minos had passed over from the Iasid family, which had"
6701,SECT. III.,reigned there shortly before the _Troica_.
6702,SECT. III.,
6703,SECT. III.,The Homeric tradition with respect to Cinyres is supported to some
6704,SECT. III.,extent from without[354]. Apollodorus so far agrees with it as to
6705,SECT. III.,"report, that Cinyres migrated from the neighbouring Asiatic continent"
6706,SECT. III.,"into Cyprus with a body of followers, founded Paphos, and married the"
6707,SECT. III.,"daughter of the king of the island. Apollodorus, Pindar, and Ovid, all"
6708,SECT. III.,treat Cinyres in a way which especially connects him with the worship
6709,SECT. III.,"of Venus, as though he had introduced it into the island; and it is"
6710,SECT. III.,"observable, that the points at which we find this deity in contact with"
6711,SECT. III.,"the race are all in Asia, or on the way from it, that is to say, Troas,"
6712,SECT. III.,"Cyprus, and lastly, Cythera: as if it were not original to the Greeks,"
6713,SECT. III.,"but engrafted, and gradually taking its hold. Sandacus was, according"
6714,SECT. III.,"to Apollodorus, the father of Cinyres, and had come from Syria into"
6715,SECT. III.,Cilicia.
6716,SECT. III.,
6717,SECT. III.,The process which we thus seem to see going forward in the Pelasgian
6718,SECT. III.,"countries, and which was probably further exemplified in the Greek"
6719,SECT. III.,"migrations to the coast of Asia Minor, was grounded in the natural,"
6720,SECT. III.,"if we mean by the natural the ordinary, course of things. In the last"
6721,SECT. III.,"century, John Wesley said, that the religious and orderly habits of"
6722,SECT. III.,"his followers would make them wealthy, and that then their wealth"
6723,SECT. III.,would destroy their religion. So in all likelihood it was the peaceful
6724,SECT. III.,habits of the Pelasgians that made their settlements attractive to the
6725,SECT. III.,"spoiler. They thus invited aggression, which their political genius and"
6726,SECT. III.,organization were not strong enough to repel; and the power of their
6727,SECT. III.,ancient but feeble sovereignties passed over into the hands of families
6728,SECT. III.,"or tribes more capable of permanently retaining it, and of wielding it"
6729,SECT. III.,with vigour and effect.
6730,SECT. III.,
6731,SECT. III.,_Negative argument from Homer._
6732,SECT. III.,
6733,SECT. III.,"I must not, however, pass from the subject of Homeric testimony"
6734,SECT. III.,"respecting the Pelasgi, without adverting to one important negative"
6735,SECT. III.,part of it.
6736,SECT. III.,
6737,SECT. III.,"It must be observed, that, as anterior to the three appellatives which"
6738,SECT. III.,"he ordinarily applies to the Greeks of the Trojan war collectively,"
6739,SECT. III.,"Homer uses no name whatever other than the Pelasgic, which is not of"
6740,SECT. III.,"limited and local application. Neither Ἀχαιοὶ, Ἀργεῖοι, nor Δαναοὶ,"
6741,SECT. III.,bear any one sign of being the proper designation of the original
6742,SECT. III.,settlers and inhabitants of all Greece: and if the name for them be
6743,SECT. III.,"not Πελασγοὶ, there certainly is no other name whatever which can"
6744,SECT. III.,"compete for the honour, none which has the same marks at once of great"
6745,SECT. III.,"antiquity, and of covering a wide range of the country. And if, as I"
6746,SECT. III.,"trust, it shall hereafter be shown, that all these came from abroad"
6747,SECT. III.,"as strangers into a country already occupied, there then will be a"
6748,SECT. III.,"presumption of no mean force arising even out of this negative, to the"
6749,SECT. III.,"effect that the Pelasgians were the original base of the Greek nation,"
6750,SECT. III.,"while we are also entitled to affirm, upon the evidence of Homer, that"
6751,SECT. III.,their race extended beyond the limits of Greece.
6752,SECT. III.,
6753,SECT. III.,Such is the supposition upon which we already begin to find that
6754,SECT. III.,"the testimony of the poems as a whole appears to converge. It is, I"
6755,SECT. III.,"grant, indirect, and fragmentary, and much of it conjectural; we may"
6756,SECT. III.,greatly enlarge its quantity from sources not yet opened: but I wish to
6757,SECT. III.,"direct particular attention to its unity and harmony, to the multitude"
6758,SECT. III.,"of indications which, though separate and individually slight, all"
6759,SECT. III.,coincide with the theory that the Pelasgi supplied the _substratum_ of
6760,SECT. III.,the Greek population subsisting under dominant Hellic influences; and
6761,SECT. III.,"to the fact, I would almost venture to add, that they can coincide with"
6762,SECT. III.,nothing else.
6763,SECT. III.,
6764,SECT. III.,_The Pelasgians; post-Homeric evidence._
6765,SECT. III.,
6766,SECT. III.,"We must proceed, however, to consider that portion of the evidence in"
6767,SECT. III.,"the case, which is external to the Homeric Poems."
6768,SECT. III.,
6769,SECT. III.,"Besides what has been up to this point incidentally touched, there is"
6770,SECT. III.,"a great mass of extra-Homeric testimony, which tends, when read in the"
6771,SECT. III.,"light of Homer, to corroborate the views which have here been taken of"
6772,SECT. III.,"the Pelasgi, as one of the main coefficients of the Greek nation."
6773,SECT. III.,
6774,SECT. III.,"In the first chapter of the able work of Bishop Marsh, entitled, _Horæ"
6775,SECT. III.,"Pelasgicæ_[355], will be found an ample collection of passages from"
6776,SECT. III.,"Greek writers, which, though many of them are in themselves slight,"
6777,SECT. III.,and any one if taken singly could be of little weight for the purpose
6778,SECT. III.,"of proof, yet collectively indicate that the possession of the entire"
6779,SECT. III.,country at the remotest period by the Pelasgi was little less than an
6780,SECT. III.,universal and invariable tradition. I will here collect some portion of
6781,SECT. III.,the evidence which may be cited to this effect.
6782,SECT. III.,
6783,SECT. III.,"Coming next to Homer in time and in authority, Hesiod supports him, as"
6784,SECT. III.,"we have seen above[356], in associating Dodona both with the Pelasgic"
6785,SECT. III.,"and with the Hellic races; placing it, just as Homer does, in the midst"
6786,SECT. III.,"of the latter, and more distinctly than Homer indicating its foundation"
6787,SECT. III.,"by the former. It may be observed that, in a Fragment, he questionably"
6788,SECT. III.,personifies Pelasgus[357].
6789,SECT. III.,
6790,SECT. III.,"Next we find the very ancient poet Asius, according to the quotation of"
6791,SECT. III.,"Pausanias[358], assigning the very highest antiquity to the Pelasgian"
6792,SECT. III.,"race, by making Pelasgus the father of men;"
6793,SECT. III.,
6794,SECT. III.,ἀντίθεον δὲ Πελασγὸν ἐν ὑψικόμοισιν ὄρεσσι
6795,SECT. III.,"γαῖα μέλαιν’ ἀνέδωκεν, ἵνα θνητῶν γένος εἴη."
6796,SECT. III.,
6797,SECT. III.,"Among the Greek writers, not being historians themselves, of the"
6798,SECT. III.,"historic period, there is none whose testimony bears, to my perception,"
6799,SECT. III.,"so much of the true archaic stamp, as Æschylus. It seems as if we could"
6800,SECT. III.,"trace in him a greater piety towards Homer, and we certainly find a"
6801,SECT. III.,"more careful regard both to his characters and his facts, than were"
6802,SECT. III.,afterwards commonly paid to them. Nay he excels in this respect the
6803,SECT. III.,"Cyclic poets. They were much nearer in date to the great master, but"
6804,SECT. III.,"he, as it were, outran them, by a deeper and nobler sympathy. In him,"
6805,SECT. III.,"too, the drama had not yet acquired the character, which effaces or"
6806,SECT. III.,impairs its claims to historical authority: which earned for it the
6807,SECT. III.,"ἐκτραγῳδεῖν of Aristotle[359] and Polybius[360], and on which was"
6808,SECT. III.,"founded the declaration of Socrates in the Minos, Ἀττικὸν λέγεις μῦθον"
6809,SECT. III.,"καὶ τραγικόν[361]. Even where he speaks allegorically, he seems to"
6810,SECT. III.,"represent the first form of allegory, in which it is traceably moulded"
6811,SECT. III.,"upon history, and serves for its key. It is not therefore unreasonable"
6812,SECT. III.,to attach importance to his rendering of the public tradition
6813,SECT. III.,"respecting the Pelasgi, which we find in a remarkable passage of the"
6814,SECT. III.,Supplices;
6815,SECT. III.,
6816,SECT. III.,τοῦ γηγενοῦς γάρ εἰμ’ ἐγὼ Παλαίχθονος

6820,SECT. III.,
6821,SECT. III.,"Pelasgus, himself the speaker, then describes his dominions as reaching"
6822,SECT. III.,from Peloponnesus (χώρη Ἀπίη) in the south to the river Strymon in
6823,SECT. III.,"the north (πρὸς δύνοντος ἡλίου), and declares how Apis, coming from"
6824,SECT. III.,"Acarnania, had fitted the country for the abode of man by clearing it"
6825,SECT. III.,"of wild beasts. Acarnania marks the line of country, which formed the"
6826,SECT. III.,"ordinary route from Thessaly to Peloponnesus. Taken literally, Pelasgus"
6827,SECT. III.,"is the son of the Earthborn, and the name-giver of the Pelasgian race."
6828,SECT. III.,"What the passage signifies evidently is, that by ancient tradition"
6829,SECT. III.,"the Pelasgians were the first occupants of the country, and that they"
6830,SECT. III.,reached from the north to the south of Greece. It is in the reign of
6831,SECT. III.,"this mythical Pelasgus, that Danaus reaches the Peloponnesus."
6832,SECT. III.,
6833,SECT. III.,"Of such an _eponymus_ Thessaly, Argos, and Arcadia had each their"
6834,SECT. III.,separate tradition in its appropriate dress. Pausanias reports the
6835,SECT. III.,Arcadian one very fully: and according to its tenour Pelasgus taught
6836,SECT. III.,"the use of dwellings and clothes, and to eat chestnuts instead of"
6837,SECT. III.,"roots, grass, and leaves[363]. The tomb of Pelasgus was pretended to be"
6838,SECT. III.,shown at Argos.
6839,SECT. III.,
6840,SECT. III.,Herodotus states that the Hellas of his day was formerly called
6841,SECT. III.,Πελασγία[364]: gives to the Peloponnesian women of the era of Danaus
6842,SECT. III.,the name of Πελασγιωτίδες γυναῖκες[365]: he denominates the Arcadians
6843,SECT. III.,"Πελασγοὶ Ἀρκάδες[366], the people of what was afterwards Achaia"
6844,SECT. III.,"Πελασγοὶ Αἰγιαλέες[367], the Athenians Πελασγοὶ Κραναοὶ[368], whom also"
6845,SECT. III.,"he describes as autochthonic[369]: and he shows, that recollections"
6846,SECT. III.,of the Pelasgian worship were preserved in his day at Dodona[370].
6847,SECT. III.,He furthermore mentions the Πελασγικὸν τεῖχος[371] at Athens; and he
6848,SECT. III.,"places the Pelasgian race in Samothrace, and Lemnos, and mentions their"
6849,SECT. III.,"settlements upon the Hellespont, named Placia and Scylace."
6850,SECT. III.,
6851,SECT. III.,Thucydides describes the spot or building called Πελασγικὸν under
6852,SECT. III.,"the Acropolis at Athens, the very situation, in which the original"
6853,SECT. III.,town would in all likelihood be placed for safety. This historian
6854,SECT. III.,"also sustains, with the weight of his judgment, the opinion that"
6855,SECT. III.,in pre-Hellenic times the prevailing race and name in Greece were
6856,SECT. III.,Pelasgic; κατὰ ἔθνη δὲ ἄλλα τε καὶ τὸ Πελασγικὸν ἐπὶ πλεῖστον[372].
6857,SECT. III.,
6858,SECT. III.,"It is true, that in another passage[373], among the races of the"
6859,SECT. III.,"βάρβαροι, he enumerates the Pelasgi: but the epithet itself, which"
6860,SECT. III.,"was wholly inapplicable to the heroic age, shows that he spoke with"
6861,SECT. III.,"reference to the demarcation established in his own time, which made"
6862,SECT. III.,"every thing barbarous that was not Greek, either geographically or"
6863,SECT. III.,by known derivation. Barbarian with him and his contemporaries meant
6864,SECT. III.,"simply foreign, with the addition of a strong dash of depreciation."
6865,SECT. III.,The full-grown Hellenic character no longer owned kindred with the
6866,SECT. III.,"particular races, which nevertheless might have contributed, each in"
6867,SECT. III.,"its own time and place, to the formation of that remarkable product."
6868,SECT. III.,"The relationship is, however, established by Thucydides himself; for he"
6869,SECT. III.,"says these Pelasgi were of the same Tyrseni, who occupied Athens at an"
6870,SECT. III.,earlier period.
6871,SECT. III.,
6872,SECT. III.,"Theocritus, who flourished early in the third century B. C., has a"
6873,SECT. III.,passage where he distinguishes chronologically between different
6874,SECT. III.,"persons and races. He begins with the heroes of the Troica, and then"
6875,SECT. III.,"goes back to the ἔτι πρότεροι, in which capacity he names the Lapithæ,"
6876,SECT. III.,"the Deucalidæ, the Pelopids, and lastly the Ἄργεος ἄκρα Πελασγοί[374]."
6877,SECT. III.,"The word ἄκρα might mean either (1) the flower of Greece, or (2)"
6878,SECT. III.,the very oldest and earliest inhabitants of Greece[375]. Now as the
6879,SECT. III.,"Pelasgians were by no means the flower of Greece, we can only choose"
6880,SECT. III.,the latter meaning for this particular passage. The word Ἄργος is
6881,SECT. III.,perhaps taken here in its largest sense[376].
6882,SECT. III.,
6883,SECT. III.,"Apollonius Rhodius, nearly a century later, adheres to part at"
6884,SECT. III.,"least of the same tradition, and calls Thessaly the πολυλήïος αἶα"
6885,SECT. III.,"Πελασγῶν[377]. The Scholiast on this passage adds an older testimony,"
6886,SECT. III.,"stating that Sophocles, in the Inachus, declared that the Πελασγοὶ and"
6887,SECT. III.,Ἀργεῖοι were the same.

6889,SECT. III.,"According to Strabo, the Pelasgi were the most ancient race which"
6890,SECT. III.,had held power in Greece: τῶν περὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα δυναστευσάντων
6891,SECT. III.,ἀρχαιότατοι[378]. In the same place he calls the oracle of Dodona
6892,SECT. III.,"Πελασγῶν ἵδρυμα, a Pelasgian foundation. He expressly supports the"
6893,SECT. III.,construction which has been given above to the Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος of
6894,SECT. III.,"Homer[379], in the words τὸ Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος ἡ Θετταλία λέγεται, and he"
6895,SECT. III.,"defines the country by the Peneus, Pindus, and Thermopylæ. He traces"
6896,SECT. III.,"the Pelasgi in a multitude of particular places, and, on the authority"
6897,SECT. III.,"of Ephorus, mentions Πελασγία as a name of Peloponnesus. He also gives"
6898,SECT. III.,"us that fragment of Euripides, which states, in harmony with the"
6899,SECT. III.,"testimony of Æschylus, that Danaus came to Greece, founded the city of"
6900,SECT. III.,"Inachus, and changed the name of the inhabitants from Pelasgiotes to"

6914,SECT. III.,"Hellenic; which I take to mean, that it was one of the component parts"
6915,SECT. III.,"of the body afterwards called Hellenic, not that the early Pelasgi were"
6916,SECT. III.,included among the early Hellenes. He considers that the race came from
6917,SECT. III.,"Peloponnesus, where many believed it to be autochthonic, into Thessaly,"
6918,SECT. III.,"under Achæus, Phthius, and Pelasgus. It was unfortunate, as in other"
6919,SECT. III.,"respects, so in being driven to frequent migrations. This idea of the"
6920,SECT. III.,frequent displacement of the Pelasgians was probably the product in the
6921,SECT. III.,"main of the two facts, first, that traces of them were found at many"
6922,SECT. III.,"widely separated points, and secondly, that, according to tradition,"
6923,SECT. III.,they had sunk into a position of inferiority.
6924,SECT. III.,
6925,SECT. III.,"K. O. Müller, proceeding chiefly on the post-Homeric tradition, has"
6926,SECT. III.,"strongly summed up the evidence as to the Pelasgi, to the following"
6927,SECT. III.,effect.
6928,SECT. III.,
6929,SECT. III.,They were the original inhabitants of the plains and flat bottoms of
6930,SECT. III.,"the valleys, any one of which the ancients called by the name Ἄργος, as"
6931,SECT. III.,"we see by the plains of the Peneus, and of the Inachus. If, as Strabo"
6932,SECT. III.,"holds, this use of the word was in his time modern, and Macedonian or"
6933,SECT. III.,"Thessalian, it may still have been a revival of a primitive usage,"
6934,SECT. III.,even as the very old word Γραικὸς had come back into use with the
6935,SECT. III.,"Alexandrian poets, through the old common tongue of Macedonia."
6936,SECT. III.,
6937,SECT. III.,"Their oldest towns were the Larissæ[382], and the number of these"
6938,SECT. III.,"points out the Pelasgians as a city-founding people, expert in raising"
6939,SECT. III.,considerable and durable structures. These Larissæ were upon alluvial
6940,SECT. III.,"soils by rivers, and the Pelasgians were early diggers of canals[383]."
6941,SECT. III.,Their pursuits were agricultural; hence they occupy the richest soils:
6942,SECT. III.,"hence Pelasgus is the host of Ceres, and the inventor of bread: hence"
6943,SECT. III.,Tyrrhenian Pelasgi convert the stony ground by Hymettus into fruitful
6944,SECT. III.,"fields. The shepherd life of the Pelasgians is an Arcadian tradition,"
6945,SECT. III.,"but Arcadia was not their only original seat, and, when displaced by"
6946,SECT. III.,"Achæans and Dorians, they may have been driven to the hills. Such seats"
6947,SECT. III.,"we find in Argos, Achaia, Peloponnesus generally, Thessalia, Epirus,"
6948,SECT. III.,"and Attica, where they may be traced in the division of the tribes."
6949,SECT. III.,
6950,SECT. III.,"Treating as an error the tradition of their vagrant character, he"
6951,SECT. III.,conceives them to be generally and above all autochthonic. He quotes
6952,SECT. III.,from Asius in Pausanias the lines which have already been quoted.
6953,SECT. III.,
6954,SECT. III.,"There is no record, he says, of their coming into Greece by"
6955,SECT. III.,"colonization. They are a people distinct, he thinks, from Lelegians"
6956,SECT. III.,"and Carians, as well as from the northern immigrants, Achæans, and"
6957,SECT. III.,Thessalians: and they are the basis and groundwork of the Greek
6958,SECT. III.,nation[384].
6959,SECT. III.,
6960,SECT. III.,In Niebuhr[385] will be found a comprehensive outline of the wide range
6961,SECT. III.,of Pelasgian occupancy in Italy: and Cramer supplies a similar sketch
6962,SECT. III.,for Asia Minor and for Greece[386].
6963,SECT. III.,
6964,SECT. III.,I forbear to quote Latin authorities as to the Pelasgi of Greece. The
6965,SECT. III.,strong Pelasgian character of Magna Græcia will of itself naturally
6966,SECT. III.,account for the free use of the name by Romans to designate the Greek
6967,SECT. III.,"nation, and cannot therefore greatly serve to show even the later"
6968,SECT. III.,"tradition concerning the ancient position of the Pelasgians in Greece,"
6969,SECT. III.,and their relations to its other inhabitants.
6970,SECT. III.,
6971,SECT. III.,"Marsh appears to assert too much, when he says that we may set down as"
6972,SECT. III.,peculiarly Pelasgian those places which retained the Pelasgian name in
6973,SECT. III.,"the historic ages. It does not follow from this retention, that Placia"
6974,SECT. III.,"and Scylace were more genuinely Pelasgian than Thessaly, any more than"
6975,SECT. III.,"we are entitled to say from Homer, that Thessaly was originally more"
6976,SECT. III.,"Pelasgian than Attica or Peloponnesus, though it retained the name"
6977,SECT. III.,"longer. The reason may have been, that no such powerful pressure from a"
6978,SECT. III.,"superior race was brought to bear in the one class of cases, as in the"
6979,SECT. III.,other[387].
6980,SECT. III.,
6981,SECT. III.,"In holding that the Pelasgians were the base, so to speak, of the"
6982,SECT. III.,"Greek nation, I mean to indicate it as a probable opinion, that they"
6983,SECT. III.,continued to form the mass of the inhabitants throughout all the
6984,SECT. III.,changes of name which succeeded the period of their rule. But it would
6985,SECT. III.,"appear, that a succession of other more vigorous influences from the"
6986,SECT. III.,"Hellic stock must have contributed far more powerfully in all respects,"
6987,SECT. III.,"excepting as to numbers, to compose and shape the nationality of the"
6988,SECT. III.,people. The chief part of the Pelasgians of Attica may perhaps have
6989,SECT. III.,"lain among the 400,000 slaves, who formed the unheeded herd of its"
6990,SECT. III.,population; much as in Italy the serfs of the Greek colonists bore the
6991,SECT. III.,Pelasgian name[388]. So large a body could scarcely have been formed
6992,SECT. III.,"in that limited territory, except out of the original inhabitants of"
6993,SECT. III.,the country. In early stages of society the bulk of society takes its
6994,SECT. III.,"impress from one, or from a few, of superior force: and the ruling"
6995,SECT. III.,"families and tribes of a smaller, but more energetic and warlike race,"
6996,SECT. III.,finding for themselves a natural place at the head of societies already
6997,SECT. III.,"constituted, assume the undisputed direction of their fortunes, and"
6998,SECT. III.,"become, by a spontaneous law, their sole representatives in the face of"
6999,SECT. III.,"the world, and in the annals of its history."
7000,SECT. III.,
7001,SECT. III.,_Language of the Pelasgians._
7002,SECT. III.,
7003,SECT. III.,"We may, however, find no inconsiderable proof of the presence of a"
7004,SECT. III.,"strong Pelasgian element in the Greek nation, in that portion of the"
7005,SECT. III.,evidence upon the case which is supplied by language. Those numerous
7006,SECT. III.,"and important words in the Latin tongue, which correspond with the"
7007,SECT. III.,"words belonging to the same ideas in Greek, could only have come from"
7008,SECT. III.,"the Pelasgian ancestry common to both countries; and, if coming from"
7009,SECT. III.,"them, must demonstrate in the one case, as in the other, the strong"
7010,SECT. III.,Pelasgian tincture of the nation.
7011,SECT. III.,
7012,SECT. III.,And as the language of a country cannot be extensively impregnated
7013,SECT. III.,"in this manner, except either by numbers, or by political and social"
7014,SECT. III.,"ascendancy (as was the case of the French tongue with the English), or"
7015,SECT. III.,by literary influence (as is now the case with us in respect to the
7016,SECT. III.,"Greek and Latin tongues), we must ask to which of these causes it was"
7017,SECT. III.,"owing, that the Pelasgians so deeply marked the Greek language with the"
7018,SECT. III.,"traces of their own tongue. It was not literary influence, for we may"
7019,SECT. III.,"be sure that there existed none. It was not political ascendancy, for"
7020,SECT. III.,"they were either enslaved, or at the least subordinate. It could only"
7021,SECT. III.,"be the influence of their numbers, through which their manner of speech"
7022,SECT. III.,could in any measure hold its ground; and thus we arrive again at the
7023,SECT. III.,"conclusion, that they must have supplied the substratum of the nation."
7024,SECT. III.,
7025,SECT. III.,"It is true that Herodotus, as well as Thucydides, spoke of the"
7026,SECT. III.,Pelasgians as using a foreign tongue. So a German writer would
7027,SECT. III.,"naturally describe the English, and yet the English language, by"
7028,SECT. III.,"one of its main ingredients, bears conclusive testimony to the Saxon"
7029,SECT. III.,"element of the English nation, and also illustrates the relative"
7030,SECT. III.,"positions, which the Saxon and Norman races are known in history to"
7031,SECT. III.,have occupied. The tongue of the Pelasgians had been subject within
7032,SECT. III.,Greece to influence and admixture from the language of the Hellic
7033,SECT. III.,tribes: beyond Greece it had received impressions from different
7034,SECT. III.,"sources; and naturally, after the consequences of this severance had"
7035,SECT. III.,"worked for centuries, the speech of the Pelasgians would be barbarous"
7036,SECT. III.,"in the eyes of the Greeks. Again, Marsh[389] observes that, in the very"
7037,SECT. III.,"chapter where he distinguishes Pelasgic from Hellenic, Herodotus (i."
7038,SECT. III.,"56) declares the Ionians to belong to one of these stocks, the Dorians"
7039,SECT. III.,to the other: both of which populations were in his time undoubtedly
7040,SECT. III.,Greek. And the historian gives another strong proof that the Pelasgians
7041,SECT. III.,"were Greek, where he assigns to this parentage (ii. 52) the Greek name"
7042,SECT. III.,"of the gods: θεοὺς δὲ προσωνόμασάν σφεας ἀπὸ τοῦ τοιούτου, ὅτι κόσμῳ"
7043,SECT. III.,θέντες τὰ πάντα πρήγματα κ.τ.λ.
7044,SECT. III.,
7045,SECT. III.,"Even if we suppose, as may have been the case, that the Pelasgi"
7046,SECT. III.,"mentioned by Herodotus, and by Thucydides, spoke a tongue as far from"
7047,SECT. III.,"the Greek actually known to either of them, as is German from the"
7048,SECT. III.,"English language at the present day, yet by its affinities that tongue"
7049,SECT. III.,"might still remain a conclusive proof, that the ancestors of those who"
7050,SECT. III.,spoke it must have formed an essential ingredient in the composition
7051,SECT. III.,"of the nation. The evidence, which we know to be good in the one case,"
7052,SECT. III.,might be equally valid in the other.
7053,SECT. III.,
7054,SECT. III.,"There is abundance of testimony among authors, both Greek and Roman,"
7055,SECT. III.,to establish the relation of the Pelasgi to the old forms of the
7056,SECT. III.,language of both countries. It is enough for the present to refer to
7057,SECT. III.,the Second Chapter of Bishop Marsh’s Horæ Pelasgicæ for a very able
7058,SECT. III.,and satisfactory discussion of the question. I shall presently have to
7059,SECT. III.,consider the particular complexion of the words which the Greek nation
7060,SECT. III.,"appear to have derived from Pelasgic sources, and the inferences which"
7061,SECT. III.,"that complexion suggests. But this will best be done, when we have"
7062,SECT. III.,examined into the Homeric import of the Hellenic and Pelasgian proper
7063,SECT. III.,names.
7064,SECT. III.,
7065,SECT. III.,_Pelasgian route into Greece._
7066,SECT. III.,
7067,SECT. III.,"We have next to examine the question,"
7068,SECT. III.,
7069,SECT. III.,By what route is it most probable that this Pelasgian nation came into
7070,SECT. III.,Greece?
7071,SECT. III.,
7072,SECT. III.,On this subject there can hardly be any other than one of two
7073,SECT. III.,"suppositions: the first, that by Thrace, or by the islands of the"
7074,SECT. III.,"north, they reached Thessaly: the other, that they crossed from Asia,"
7075,SECT. III.,"to the south of the Ægean, by the islands which divide the spaces of"
7076,SECT. III.,that sea.
7077,SECT. III.,
7078,SECT. III.,"It is observed by Cramer[390], that the prevailing opinion among those"
7079,SECT. III.,"ancient writers, who have discussed the subject, places the Pelasgians"
7080,SECT. III.,"first in the Peloponnesus: this being maintained by Pherecydes,"
7081,SECT. III.,"Ephorus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Pausanias, without any"
7082,SECT. III.,dissentients to oppose them. This tradition evidently favours the
7083,SECT. III.,opinion of a passage by the south.
7084,SECT. III.,
7085,SECT. III.,"Dionysius, who may be regarded as summing up the general results of"
7086,SECT. III.,"Greek tradition, says[391] it placed the Pelasgians first in the"
7087,SECT. III.,Peloponnesus as autochthons; and represented them as having migrated
7088,SECT. III.,"to Thessaly in the sixth generation. In six generations more, they"
7089,SECT. III.,"were, he conceives, expelled by the Ætolians and Locrians, then"
7090,SECT. III.,"called Curetes and Leleges, and were dispersed into various quarters:"
7091,SECT. III.,"indeed, here the tradition seems to become wholly vague or mythical,"
7092,SECT. III.,and to have gathered into one mass most of the places in which there
7093,SECT. III.,appeared signs of Pelasgic occupancy: it includes the report of a great
7094,SECT. III.,migration to Italy.
7095,SECT. III.,
7096,SECT. III.,Marsh[392] considers Thrace as the original seat in Europe of the
7097,SECT. III.,Pelasgi; but the _data_ on which he proceeds are too narrow; they
7098,SECT. III.,"have reference only to the islands of Lemnus, Imbrus, and Samothrace."
7099,SECT. III.,There is no evidence of Pelasgians on the Continent to the north of
7100,SECT. III.,the Ægean except what places them at a distance from Troy (τῆλε Hom.
7101,SECT. III.,"Il. xvii. 301), and if so, at a point which they may have reached from"
7102,SECT. III.,"those islands, more probably, than by the continental route. It is on"
7103,SECT. III.,"the whole more likely, however, that Pelasgians may have found their"
7104,SECT. III.,"way into Greece both by the north (and if so, probably through the"
7105,SECT. III.,"islands), and also by the south."
7106,SECT. III.,
7107,SECT. III.,Homer affords no materials for conclusively determining the question.
7108,SECT. III.,"He gives us the Pelasgic name established in Thessaly, which favours"
7109,SECT. III.,"our supposing the one passage, and likewise in Crete, which favours"
7110,SECT. III.,the other. He gives us the Pelasgic Jove of Dodona (a very weighty
7111,SECT. III.,"piece of testimony), and the τέμενος of Ceres in Thessaly, telling"
7112,SECT. III.,rather for the first; and he likewise gives us a perceptible connection
7113,SECT. III.,"between Ceres and Crete, and between Jupiter and king Minos, verging"
7114,SECT. III.,"to the latter. But it is to be observed that, with the exception of"
7115,SECT. III.,"Attica, the chief Homeric tokens of Pelasgianism lie in Northern and in"
7116,SECT. III.,"Southern, but not in Middle, Greece: which favours the opinion, that"
7117,SECT. III.,there may have been a double line of entry.
7118,SECT. III.,
7119,SECT. III.,The extra-Homeric tradition is on the whole most favourable to the
7120,SECT. III.,supposition of a southern route. Hesiod makes Dodona in Thessaly
7121,SECT. III.,"Pelasgian, but distinctly associates Ceres with Crete: and the Theogony"
7122,SECT. III.,"(479, 80) sends Jupiter as an infant to be reared in Crete. The Hymn"
7123,SECT. III.,"to Ceres, as we have seen, brings her from thence to Eleusis; and"
7124,SECT. III.,the popular mythology in general treats that island as the cradle
7125,SECT. III.,"of Jupiter, therefore manifestly as the place from which the Greeks"
7126,SECT. III.,derived his worship. More than this; the tradition makes Peloponnesus
7127,SECT. III.,"the seat and centre of Pelasgic power, as we see from Æschylus, who"
7128,SECT. III.,"makes Pelasgus reside in Peloponnesus, but rule as far as Macedonia."
7129,SECT. III.,So likewise the names both of Ἀπίη γαῖα and of Ἰασὸν Ἄργος connect
7130,SECT. III.,themselves originally with this part of Greece: especially when we
7131,SECT. III.,"consider that Apis in Egypt is the sacred bull, and that agriculture,"
7132,SECT. III.,"the characteristic pursuit of the Pelasgians, was also the business of"
7133,SECT. III.,"oxen. Again, Herodotus[393] reports that the local tradition of Dodona"
7134,SECT. III.,"assigned to that oracle an Egyptian origin; and as Dodona was Pelasgic,"
7135,SECT. III.,this tradition somewhat favours the hypothesis of entry by the south.
7136,SECT. III.,
7137,SECT. III.,"There are several allusions in Homer to Crete, to Cyprus, or to both,"
7138,SECT. III.,"as marking the route between Greece and Asia. Menelaus, after quitting"
7139,SECT. III.,"Troy, and nearing Crete (Od. iii. 285-92), sailed afar"
7140,SECT. III.,
7141,SECT. III.,Κύπρον Φοινίκην τε καὶ Αἰγυπτίους ἐπαληθεῖς[394].
7142,SECT. III.,
7143,SECT. III.,"The pseudo-Ulysses sails from Crete to Egypt[395], and returns"
7144,SECT. III.,"thence to Phœnicia, in one tale, and afterwards starts for Libya by"
7145,SECT. III.,"Crete; in another legend, he is given over from Egypt to Cyprus; and"
7146,SECT. III.,"Antinous[396], in the Seventeenth Odyssey, replying to the supposed"
7147,SECT. III.,"beggar-man, says, Get out of the way,"
7148,SECT. III.,
7149,SECT. III.,μὴ τάχα πικρὴν Αἴγυπτον καὶ Κύπρον ἵκηαι.
7150,SECT. III.,
7151,SECT. III.,We already know the connection of Crete with Greece from the Iliad: and
7152,SECT. III.,"thus it appears as on the high road from Greece to Phœnicia, and by"
7153,SECT. III.,"Phœnicia to Egypt. The unexampled populousness of that island would,"
7154,SECT. III.,"as a matter of course, beget migration; and, of all the tracts lying"
7155,SECT. III.,"to the west of the Ægean, the Thessalian plain would, from its extent,"
7156,SECT. III.,offer perhaps the greatest encouragement to agricultural settlers.
7157,SECT. III.,The traditions reported by Herodotus from Dodona connect that place
7158,SECT. III.,"closely with Egypt and the East, and the route now supposed by Crete"
7159,SECT. III.,establishes that connection in what is probably the simplest and most
7160,SECT. III.,obvious line.
7161,SECT. III.,
7162,SECT. III.,The continental country from Thessaly to the north and east was held
7163,SECT. III.,as it would appear to a great extent by a martial and highland race
7164,SECT. III.,Θρῇκες and Θρηίκιοι. It is not likely that the Pelasgians had much
7165,SECT. III.,"in common with that people, or could make their way to Greece either"
7166,SECT. III.,with or in despite of them. Perhaps the coast where we find Cicones
7167,SECT. III.,"and Pæones apart from the Thracians, may have afforded a route, and we"
7168,SECT. III.,must remember the traditional traces of them both on the coast of the
7169,SECT. III.,Hellespont and in the islands[397].
7170,SECT. III.,
7171,SECT. III.,"This may be the place most convenient for observing, that there can"
7172,SECT. III.,be little hesitation in regarding the northern route as that by which
7173,SECT. III.,"the Hellic tribes came into Greece. They, a highland people, came"
7174,SECT. III.,"along a mountain country. They left their name upon the Hellespont,"
7175,SECT. III.,"the sea of Helle, which means not the mere strait so called in later"
7176,SECT. III.,"times, but the whole northern Ægean[398]; and upon the river Selleeis,"
7177,SECT. III.,which discharges itself into the sea of Marmora. We first hear of them
7178,SECT. III.,in Homer at the extreme north of Thessaly: then we find them giving
7179,SECT. III.,"their name, Hellas, to that country, or to some part of it. The people"
7180,SECT. III.,"of Hellas, when their connection with their sires of the mountain had"
7181,SECT. III.,become faint in comparison with their relation to the territory they
7182,SECT. III.,"occupied, called themselves Hellenes, from the region they inhabited;"
7183,SECT. III.,"and lost sight, as it were, of the ruder parent tribe. In the meantime,"
7184,SECT. III.,"they had struck out offshoots through Greece, and the name Hellas had,"
7185,SECT. III.,"as will be seen[399], probably come, even in the time of Homer, to be"
7186,SECT. III.,applied in a secondary and comprehensive sense to the whole northern
7187,SECT. III.,and central parts of it.
7188,SECT. III.,
7189,SECT. III.,_Peloponnesus the seat of power._
7190,SECT. III.,
7191,SECT. III.,"It is remarkable and undeniable, with reference both to Pelasgic and"
7192,SECT. III.,"to Hellenic times, that in whatever part of the country ruling tribes"
7193,SECT. III.,"or families might first make their appearance, the permanent seat of"
7194,SECT. III.,power for Greece was uniformly in the Peloponnesus. Every movement
7195,SECT. III.,"of political importance appears to direct itself thither, and there"
7196,SECT. III.,"to rest in equilibrium. The old tradition of Pelasgus, the dynasties"
7197,SECT. III.,"of Danaids, Perseids, and Pelopids, the great Heraclid and Doric"
7198,SECT. III.,"invasion, evidently aiming at laying hold on the centre of dominion,"
7199,SECT. III.,"and yet more, that Spartan primacy (ἡγεμονία), which endured for so"
7200,SECT. III.,"many centuries, all tell the same tale; finally the train of evidence"
7201,SECT. III.,is crowned by the strong local sympathies of Juno. It was only in
7202,SECT. III.,the fifth century before the Christian era that Athens acquired the
7203,SECT. III.,"lead: nor did she keep it long. Her sway, after an interval, was"
7204,SECT. III.,"followed by another shortlived ascendancy, that of Thebes, in the"
7205,SECT. III.,fourth century. But Greece ended as she had begun: and the last
7206,SECT. III.,splendours of her national sentiment and military courage were flung
7207,SECT. III.,"from its pristine seats in Peloponnesus: from Lacedæmon, and Achaia."
7208,SECT. III.,"The old Amphictyonic Union alone remained, throughout the historic"
7209,SECT. III.,"times of Greece, to bear witness to the fact that it was in the north"
7210,SECT. III.,"of the Isthmus, and above all in Thessaly, that the Hellic tribes"
7211,SECT. III.,"first organised themselves as distinct political integers, united"
7212,SECT. III.,"in substance, if not in form, in respect of their common religious"
7213,SECT. III.,"worship, and their common blood."
7214,SECT. III.,
7215,SECT. III.,"It was probably greater security, which gave this advantage, in"
7216,SECT. III.,"early times, to Southern over Northern and Midland Greece. Only one"
7217,SECT. III.,"narrow neck of land led into the Peloponnesus, and that passage was"
7218,SECT. III.,"so circuitous, or dangerous, or both, that it was not the highway of"
7219,SECT. III.,"immigrant tribes, who seem usually to have crossed the Corinthian gulf"
7220,SECT. III.,"into Elis. This tract of land had not indeed the whole, but it had"
7221,SECT. III.,"much, of the advantage enjoyed by England. It was not quite, but it was"
7222,SECT. III.,"almost,"
7223,SECT. III.,
7224,SECT. III.,"A precious stone, set in the silver sea,"
7225,SECT. III.,"Which serves it in the office of a wall,"
7226,SECT. III.,Or as a moat defensive to a house[400].
7227,SECT. III.,
7228,SECT. III.,"When reached, it was the highway to nothing. The fat lands of Bœotia"
7229,SECT. III.,were a road onwards for all who came from Thessaly: there was here a
7230,SECT. III.,"choice between barrenness and poverty, on the one hand, like those of"
7231,SECT. III.,"Attica in early times, and insecurity of tenure in the rich soils,"
7232,SECT. III.,which were the object of desire to each tribe as it went upon its
7233,SECT. III.,"march. The Peloponnesus was richer than the one, far more secure than"
7234,SECT. III.,the other: it throve accordingly; and in the Trojan war this small
7235,SECT. III.,"territory supplied four hundred and thirty ships, probably including"
7236,SECT. III.,"the greatest number of large vessels, while the other two divisions of"
7237,SECT. III.,continental Greece together gave no more than five hundred and thirty.
7238,SECT. III.,And it seems to have had altogether a more vigorous and concentrated
7239,SECT. III.,political organisation; for while the five hundred and thirty were in
7240,SECT. III.,"fifteen divisions, under twenty-six leaders, the Peloponnesian force"
7241,SECT. III.,"was in six divisions, under nine leaders only, and of the six three at"
7242,SECT. III.,"least, namely, those of Mycenæ, Lacedæmon, and Arcadia, were virtually"
7243,SECT. III.,under the direct command of Agamemnon.
7244,SECT. III.,
7245,SECT. III.,_Derivation of the Pelasgian name._
7246,SECT. III.,
7247,SECT. III.,Various derivations have been suggested for the name of the Pelasgi.
7248,SECT. III.,"Some will have it to come from Peleg, mentioned in the tenth chapter"
7249,SECT. III.,"of Genesis, whose name, said to mean division, is taken to allude to"
7250,SECT. III.,the partition of the earth’s surface among the various tribes of the
7251,SECT. III.,"human race. Marsh well observes, that this amounts to no more than"
7252,SECT. III.,possibility: that the meaning of the word will not serve to attach
7253,SECT. III.,"it to the Pelasgi in particular, as in the early ages of the world"
7254,SECT. III.,"migration, with partition and repartition, was a continuous process:"
7255,SECT. III.,"and that, even if true, it tells us nothing of them antecedent to their"
7256,SECT. III.,"European settlement[401]: nothing, that is to say, of a material kind,"
7257,SECT. III.,"except what we know independently of it, viz. their being, in common"
7258,SECT. III.,"with all other races, of eastern origin. Clinton gives other reasons"
7259,SECT. III.,"for rejecting this etymology[402], while he sees force in the reference"
7260,SECT. III.,of the names of Iapetus and Ion to Japheth and Javan respectively.
7261,SECT. III.,It seems plain that we could not safely build upon even a complete
7262,SECT. III.,"similarity of name, in a case where the interval of time that separates"
7263,SECT. III.,"Peleg and Pelasgi, the terms we are to compare, is so vast and so"
7264,SECT. III.,obscure.
7265,SECT. III.,
7266,SECT. III.,"So also the name πελαργοὶ, meaning storks, has been taken to be the"
7267,SECT. III.,"foundation of Πελασγοί; and the explanation has been given, that the"
7268,SECT. III.,"stork is a migratory bird, and that the Pelasgi were called after it"
7269,SECT. III.,on account of their wanderings.
7270,SECT. III.,
7271,SECT. III.,"This explanation, which seems worse than the former, rests in part"
7272,SECT. III.,upon a statement of Herodotus misconstrued. He calls the Dorians ἔθνος
7273,SECT. III.,"πουλυπλάνητον κάρτα[403], and this has been erroneously applied to the"
7274,SECT. III.,"Pelasgians, of whom, on the contrary, he says, οὐδαμῆ κω ἐξεχώρησε."
7275,SECT. III.,"This statement from a writer of the age of Herodotus, fully neutralises"
7276,SECT. III.,"the statement of Dionysius, who describes them as itinerant, and never"
7277,SECT. III.,"securely settled[404]. He may, indeed, mean no more than Thucydides"
7278,SECT. III.,"means, when he says (i. 2), that the occupants of good soils were"
7279,SECT. III.,the most liable to dispossession. But does this idea of itinerancy
7280,SECT. III.,"correspond with the migrations of the stork, which seem to have"
7281,SECT. III.,"reference to the steady periodical variations of climate, and to be as"
7282,SECT. III.,far as possible from the idea implied in ‘much-roving?’
7283,SECT. III.,
7284,SECT. III.,"It appears to have been the understood characteristic of that bird,"
7285,SECT. III.,to draw to and dwell about the settled habitations of men. It seems
7286,SECT. III.,"highly improbable, and without precedent, that a widely spread nation"
7287,SECT. III.,should take its name from a bird: but may not the bird have taken its
7288,SECT. III.,"name from the nation? If it were a nation emphatically of settlers,"
7289,SECT. III.,"as opposed to pirates, robbers, nomads, and rovers of all kinds,"
7290,SECT. III.,"dwelling with comfort in fixed abodes, as opposed to the ἀνιπτόποδες"
7291,SECT. III.,"χαμαίευναι[405], might not birds, which seemed to share these"
7292,SECT. III.,"settlements, be reasonably named after the people?"
7293,SECT. III.,
7294,SECT. III.,"It by no means appears as if Aristophanes, in the passage where"
7295,SECT. III.,"he uses the term, intended a mere pun. It is in the comedy of the"
7296,SECT. III.,"Birds[406], and is an allusion to that law of the Athenians, evidently"
7297,SECT. III.,"here signified under the name of storks, which required children to"
7298,SECT. III.,provide for their parents[407]. The passage is clearly a testimony to
7299,SECT. III.,the Pelasgic origin of the Athenians: and it may be based upon the
7300,SECT. III.,"belief, that the storks took their name from the Pelasgi, and that"
7301,SECT. III.,the similarity lay in their habit of settling on the roofs of houses
7302,SECT. III.,"and the like, almost as if inhabitants, in the villages of which the"
7303,SECT. III.,Pelasgi were the first Greek founders. It also gives room for the
7304,SECT. III.,conjecture that Πελαργοὶ may have been the old form of the name.
7305,SECT. III.,"The stork, it may be remembered, was one of the sacred birds of the"
7306,SECT. III.,Egyptians.
7307,SECT. III.,
7308,SECT. III.,"Again, the word πέλαγος has been suggested as supplying the true"
7309,SECT. III.,"derivation of the Pelasgian name. Marsh[408] rejects it, because he"
7310,SECT. III.,conceives it is founded upon the hypothesis that the Pelasgi came
7311,SECT. III.,"across the Ægean, which he thinks improbable. But the evidence appears"
7312,SECT. III.,"to be in favour of their having come principally by the islands, if"
7313,SECT. III.,"not at once across the Ægean. It may also be questioned, whether the"
7314,SECT. III.,"etymology must rest on this hypothesis exclusively. For, in the first"
7315,SECT. III.,"place, the more natural construction would be, not that they came by"
7316,SECT. III.,"sea, but that they came _from beyond sea_, an idea which might very"
7317,SECT. III.,well attach to any people of Asiatic origin. So it was that the too
7318,SECT. III.,"famous Pelagius, who is known to have been a Welshman, came by his"
7319,SECT. III.,classical name; a name bearing that very signification[409]. But
7320,SECT. III.,"is it not also possible, that πέλαγος may at one time have had the"
7321,SECT. III.,"meaning of a plain? It properly signifies a wide open level surface,"
7322,SECT. III.,"corresponding with the Latin _æquor_, and with our _main_. Hence Homer"
7323,SECT. III.,never attaches to the word πέλαγος any of his usual epithets for
7324,SECT. III.,"the sea, such as οἴνοψ, ἠχηεὶς, μεγακήτης, ἀτρύγετος, πολύφλοισβος;"
7325,SECT. III.,"but only μέγα, great: and he uses the phrase ἅλος ἐν πελάγεσσι[410],"
7326,SECT. III.,"which would be mere tautology, if πέλαγος properly and directly meant"
7327,SECT. III.,"the sea. So Pindar has πόντιον πέλαγος, Æschylus ἃλς πελαγία, and"
7328,SECT. III.,"Apollonius Rhodius πέλαγος θαλάσσης[411]. There were in Macedonia, as"
7329,SECT. III.,"we learn from Strabo, a people called Pelagones[412], and in Homer"
7330,SECT. III.,"we find the names Πελάγων and Πηλέγων. Again, we have in Hesychius,"
7331,SECT. III.,"among the meanings of πελαγίζειν, ψεύδεσθαι μεγάλα, and for πέλαγος he"
7332,SECT. III.,"gives μέγεθος, πλῆθος, βύθος; as well as πλάτος θαλάσσης. It seems not"
7333,SECT. III.,"impossible that the Pelasgi may owe their name to the word πέλαγος, in"
7334,SECT. III.,"its primary sense of plain and open surface: as the word Θρῇξ, in this"
7335,SECT. III.,"view its exact counterpart, was derived from τρῆχυς, and at one time"
7336,SECT. III.,"meant simply the inhabitant of a rough and rocky place, a mountaineer"
7337,SECT. III.,or highlander.
7338,SECT. III.,
7339,SECT. III.,"There is, however, another mode in which Πελασγοὶ may bear the sense of"
7340,SECT. III.,"inhabitants of the plain, or rather (for it is in this that the word"
7341,SECT. III.,"will most comprehensively apply to them, and most closely keep to its"
7342,SECT. III.,"proper meaning), of the cultivable country, which would include valleys"
7343,SECT. III.,"as well as plains properly so called: and indeed this derivation,"
7344,SECT. III.,"suggested by K. O. Müller, is the simplest possible, if only we can"
7345,SECT. III.,"clear the first step, which _assumes_ the identity of Πελασγοὶ and"
7346,SECT. III.,Πελαργοί. He says it is compounded of πέλω and ἄργος. The first meaning
7347,SECT. III.,of πέλω seems to imply motion with repetition or custom. Afterwards it
7348,SECT. III.,"is _to be_, and especially _to be wont to be_. Thus it will, while yet"
7349,SECT. III.,"very near its fountain, have the sense, _to frequent_ or _inhabit_."
7350,SECT. III.,"To the same origin he refers πόλις, πολέω; and also the πελώρια, the"
7351,SECT. III.,"harvest feast of Thessaly, taken as the feast of inhabitation[413] or"
7352,SECT. III.,settlement.
7353,SECT. III.,
7354,SECT. III.,"The subject of this name will again come into view, when the later"
7355,SECT. III.,"name of Ἀργεῖοι is examined. In the mean time, let it be observed,"
7356,SECT. III.,"that if the Pelasgi were thus called from being, or if only they in"
7357,SECT. III.,"fact were, inhabitants of the plains, we find in this some further"
7358,SECT. III.,"explanation of the tradition, which can hardly have been an unmixed"
7359,SECT. III.,"error, of their vagrant character. For the plains contained the most"
7360,SECT. III.,"fertile soils: and, especially as they were of limited extent, their"
7361,SECT. III.,"inhabitants could not but rapidly increase, so as to require more space"
7362,SECT. III.,"for the support of their population. Further, these rich tracts offered"
7363,SECT. III.,a prize to all the tribes who were in want of settlements; according
7364,SECT. III.,"to the just observation of Thucydides[414], already quoted, that the"
7365,SECT. III.,"most fertile parts of Greece, namely, Bœotia, Thessaly, and much of"
7366,SECT. III.,"Peloponnesus, most frequently changed hands. This would be more and"
7367,SECT. III.,"more applicable to a given people, in proportion as it might be more"
7368,SECT. III.,"addicted to peaceful pursuits. Manifestly, it is as inhabitants of the"
7369,SECT. III.,"plains, or the cultivable country, that Homer especially marks the"
7370,SECT. III.,"Pelasgi: both by calling the great plain of Thessaly Pelasgic, and by"
7371,SECT. III.,"the epithet ἐριβώλαξ which he applies (Il. ii. 841, and xvii. 301), to"
7372,SECT. III.,"their Larissa, on the only two occasions when he mentions it. And the"
7373,SECT. III.,"etymological inquiry seems, upon the whole, to direct us, although the"
7374,SECT. III.,"particular path be somewhat uncertain, towards a similar conclusion."

7682,SECT. IV.,
7683,SECT. IV.,"The text of Homer appears to afford presumptions, if not of close"
7684,SECT. IV.,"affinity between the Phœnician and Hellenic races, yet of close"
7685,SECT. IV.,"congeniality, and of great capacity for amalgamation; although the"
7686,SECT. IV.,former were of Semitic origin.
7687,SECT. IV.,
7688,SECT. IV.,"The Phœnician name, as may be seen from Strabo, was widely spread"
7689,SECT. IV.,"through Greece: even in Homer we find the word Φοίνιξ already used, (1)"
7690,SECT. IV.,"for a Phœnician, (2) for a Greek proper name, (3) for purple, and (4)"
7691,SECT. IV.,for the palm tree (Od. v. 163).
7692,SECT. IV.,
7693,SECT. IV.,We find the ancient family of Cadmus established as a dynasty in
7694,SECT. IV.,"Bœotia, about the same time, according to the common opinion, with"
7695,SECT. IV.,the earliest appearances of the Hellenic race in the Greek peninsula.
7696,SECT. IV.,We have no reason to suppose that they were themselves of Hellic
7697,SECT. IV.,extraction: but we find them invested with the same marks of political
7698,SECT. IV.,"superiority as the Hellenic families, and figuring among the Greek"
7699,SECT. IV.,sovereigns in successive generations. They must have ejected previous
7700,SECT. IV.,"occupants: for Amphion and Zethus first settled and fortified Thebes,"
7701,SECT. IV.,and they were the sons of Jupiter and Antiope[415].
7702,SECT. IV.,
7703,SECT. IV.,"Ino Leucothee, the daughter of Cadmus, was already a deity in the time"
7704,SECT. IV.,"of Homer. She appears in that capacity to Ulysses, when he is tossed"
7705,SECT. IV.,"upon the waters between Ogygia and Phæacia; that is to say, when he"
7706,SECT. IV.,"was still beyond the limits of the Greek or Homeric world, and within"
7707,SECT. IV.,"the circle of those traditions, lying in the unknown distance, which"
7708,SECT. IV.,the Greeks could only derive from the most experienced and daring
7709,SECT. IV.,"navigators of the time; namely, the Phœnicians. This appears to mark"
7710,SECT. IV.,"Ino herself, and therefore her father Cadmus, as of Phœnician birth."
7711,SECT. IV.,"And accordingly we may set down the position of this family in Greece,"
7712,SECT. IV.,as the earliest token of relations between Phœnicia and Greece.
7713,SECT. IV.,
7714,SECT. IV.,"It is followed by one more significant still, and more clearly attested"
7715,SECT. IV.,"in Homer. Minos, a Phœnician, appears in Crete and founds an empire:"
7716,SECT. IV.,he marries his daughter Ariadne to the Athenian hero Theseus; and so
7717,SECT. IV.,"quickly does this empire assume the national character, that in the"
7718,SECT. IV.,"time of the _Troica_, Hellenic races are established in the island, the"
7719,SECT. IV.,Cretan troops are numbered without distinction among the followers of
7720,SECT. IV.,"Agamemnon; and Idomeneus, only the grandson of Minos, appears to be as"
7721,SECT. IV.,Grecian as any of the other chiefs of the army. The grandfather himself
7722,SECT. IV.,is appointed to act as judge over the shades of Greeks in the nether
7723,SECT. IV.,"world[416]: and his brother Rhadamanthus has a post of great dignity,"
7724,SECT. IV.,"if of inferior responsibility, in being intrusted with the police of"
7725,SECT. IV.,Elysium[417].
7726,SECT. IV.,
7727,SECT. IV.,"Nowhere is Homer’s precision more remarkable, than in the numerous"
7728,SECT. IV.,passages where he appears before us as a real geographer or
7729,SECT. IV.,"topographer. Indeed, by virtue of this accuracy, he enables us to"
7730,SECT. IV.,define with considerable confidence the sphere of his knowledge and
7731,SECT. IV.,experience; by which I mean not only the countries and places he had
7732,SECT. IV.,"visited, but those with respect to which he had habitual information"
7733,SECT. IV.,"from his countrymen, and unrestricted opportunities of correcting"
7734,SECT. IV.,"error. In the direction of the west, it seems plain that he knew"
7735,SECT. IV.,nothing except the coast of Greece and the coastward islands. Phæacia
7736,SECT. IV.,"hangs doubtfully upon his horizon, and it is probable that he had only"
7737,SECT. IV.,"a very general and vague idea of its position. Towards the north, there"
7738,SECT. IV.,"is nothing to imply, that his experimental knowledge reached beyond the"
7739,SECT. IV.,"Thracian coast and, at the farthest, the Sea of Marmora. He speaks of"
7740,SECT. IV.,"Ida, as if its roots and spurs comprised the whole district, of which"
7741,SECT. IV.,"in that quarter he could speak with confidence[418]. To the east, he"
7742,SECT. IV.,"probably knew no region beyond Lycia on the coast of Asia Minor, and to"
7743,SECT. IV.,"the south Crete was probably his boundary: though he was aware, by name"
7744,SECT. IV.,"at least, of the leading geographical points of a maritime passage, not"
7745,SECT. IV.,"wholly unfrequented, to the almost unknown regions of Cyprus, Phœnicia,"
7746,SECT. IV.,and Egypt. The apparent inconsistency however of his statements[419]
7747,SECT. IV.,"respecting the voyage to Egypt, affords proof that it lay beyond the"
7748,SECT. IV.,"geographical circle, within which we are to consider that his familiar"
7749,SECT. IV.,knowledge and that of his nation lay.
7750,SECT. IV.,
7751,SECT. IV.,"While he is within that circle, he is studious alike of the distances"
7752,SECT. IV.,"between places, the forms of country, and the physical character of"
7753,SECT. IV.,"different districts: but, when he passes beyond it, he emancipates"
7754,SECT. IV.,himself from the laws of space. The points touched in the voyage
7755,SECT. IV.,"of Ulysses are wholly irreconcilable with actual geography, though"
7756,SECT. IV.,national partialities have endeavoured to identify them with a view to
7757,SECT. IV.,"particular appropriation. Some of them, indeed, we may conceive that he"
7758,SECT. IV.,"mentally associated with places that had been described to him: nay, he"
7759,SECT. IV.,"may have intended it in all: but the dislocated knowledge, which alone"
7760,SECT. IV.,"even the navigators of the age would possess, has suffered, by intent"
7761,SECT. IV.,"or accident, such further derangement in its transfer to the mind of"
7762,SECT. IV.,"Homer, that it is hopeless to adjust his geography otherwise than by a"
7763,SECT. IV.,"free and large infusion of fictitious drawing. This outer sphere is,"
7764,SECT. IV.,"however, peopled with imagery of deep interest. For the purposes of"
7765,SECT. IV.,"the poem, the whole wanderings both of Menelaus and Ulysses lie within"
7766,SECT. IV.,"it, and beyond the limits of ordinary Greek experience. And throughout"
7767,SECT. IV.,"these wanderings the language of Homer is that of a poet who, as to"
7768,SECT. IV.,"facts, was at the mercy of unsifted information; of information which"
7769,SECT. IV.,"he must either receive from a source not liable to check or scrutiny,"
7770,SECT. IV.,or else not receive at all: and who wisely availed himself of that
7771,SECT. IV.,"character of the marvellous with which the whole was overspread, to"
7772,SECT. IV.,"work it up into pictures of the imagination, which were to fill both"
7773,SECT. IV.,his contemporaries and all succeeding generations with emotions of
7774,SECT. IV.,interest and wonder.
7775,SECT. IV.,
7776,SECT. IV.,_Limits of Greek navigation._
7777,SECT. IV.,
7778,SECT. IV.,"In Homer we find that Greek navigation already extends, yet it is very"
7779,SECT. IV.,"slightly, beyond the limits of Greek settlement. The Pseudo-Ulysses of"
7780,SECT. IV.,"the Fourteenth Odyssey made nine voyages[420], ἀνδρὰς ἐς ἀλλοδάπους;"
7781,SECT. IV.,"and at length, inspired as he says by a wild impulse from on high,"
7782,SECT. IV.,he planned and executed a voyage to Egypt. But he is represented
7783,SECT. IV.,"as a Cretan, and the early fame of Crete in navigation is probably"
7784,SECT. IV.,due to its connection through Minos with Phœnicia. Here too the
7785,SECT. IV.,"representation is, that he is a Cretan of the highest class, the"
7786,SECT. IV.,"colleague of Idomeneus in his command[421], and thus, according to the"
7787,SECT. IV.,"law of poetical likelihood, to be understood as probably of a family"
7788,SECT. IV.,belonging to the Phœnician train of Minos. The Thesprotian ship of the
7789,SECT. IV.,"Fourteenth Odyssey trades for corn to Dulichium only. The Taphians,"
7790,SECT. IV.,"indeed, who from the xenial relation of their lord, Mentes[422], to"
7791,SECT. IV.,"Ulysses, must in all likelihood have lived in the neighbourhood of"
7792,SECT. IV.,"Ithaca, are represented as making voyages not only to an unknown"
7793,SECT. IV.,"Temese, which was in foreign parts (ἐπ’ ἀλλοθρόους ἀνθρώπους[423]), but"
7794,SECT. IV.,"likewise to Phœnicia; the latter voyage, however, is only mentioned in"
7795,SECT. IV.,connection with the purpose of piracy[424]. But these Taphians appear
7796,SECT. IV.,to have formed an insignificant exception to the general rule: we do
7797,SECT. IV.,not hear any thing of them in the great armament of the Iliad. Speaking
7798,SECT. IV.,"generally, we may say that the Achæans had no foreign navigation: it"
7799,SECT. IV.,was in the hands of the Phœnicians.
7800,SECT. IV.,
7801,SECT. IV.,_The Outer Geography Phœnician._
7802,SECT. IV.,
7803,SECT. IV.,"It is to that people that we must look as the established merchants,"
7804,SECT. IV.,"hardiest navigators, and furthest explorers, of those days. To them"
7805,SECT. IV.,"alone as a body, in the whole Homeric world of flesh and blood, does"
7806,SECT. IV.,Homer give the distinctive epithet of ναυσικλυτοὶ ἄνδρες[425]. He
7807,SECT. IV.,"accords it indeed to the airy Phæacians, but in all probability that"
7808,SECT. IV.,"element of their character is borrowed from the Phœnicians[426], and"
7809,SECT. IV.,"if so, the reason of the derivation can only be, that the Phœnicians"
7810,SECT. IV.,were for that age the type of a nautical people. To them only does he
7811,SECT. IV.,"assign the epithets, which belong to the knavery of trade, namely,"
7812,SECT. IV.,πολυπαίπαλοι and τρωκταί. When we hear of their ships in Egypt or
7813,SECT. IV.,"in Greece, the circumstance is mentioned as if their coming was in"
7814,SECT. IV.,"the usual course of their commercial operations. Some force also, in"
7815,SECT. IV.,"respect to national history, may be assigned to the general tradition,"
7816,SECT. IV.,which almost makes the Mediterranean of the heroic age ‘a Phœnician
7817,SECT. IV.,"lake:’ to their settlements in Spain, and the strong hold they took"
7818,SECT. IV.,"upon that country; and to the indirect Homeric testimony, as well as"
7819,SECT. IV.,"the judgment of Thucydides, respecting the maritime character of the"
7820,SECT. IV.,Minoan empire.
7821,SECT. IV.,
7822,SECT. IV.,"Again, Homer knew of a class of merchants whom he calls πρηκτῆρες"
7823,SECT. IV.,in the Eighth Odyssey (v. 152). But where Eumæus enumerates the
7824,SECT. IV.,"δημιόεργοι, or ‘trades and professions’ of a Greek community, there are"
7825,SECT. IV.,"no πρηκτῆρες among them[427]. Again, as the poet knew of the existence"
7826,SECT. IV.,"of this class on earth, so he introduced them into his Olympian heaven,"
7827,SECT. IV.,where gain and increase had their representative in Mercury. From
7828,SECT. IV.,"whence could the prototype have been derived, except from intercourse"
7829,SECT. IV.,with the Phœnicians?
7830,SECT. IV.,
7831,SECT. IV.,But the imaginative geography of the Odyssey goes far beyond the
7832,SECT. IV.,"points, with which Homer has so much at least of substantive"
7833,SECT. IV.,"acquaintance, as to associate them historically with the commerce or"
7834,SECT. IV.,"politics of the age. The habitations of the Cyclops, the Læstrygones,"
7835,SECT. IV.,"the Lotophagi, of Æolus, the Sirens, Calypso, and Circe, may have"
7836,SECT. IV.,"had no ‘whereabout,’ no actual site, outside the fancy of Homer;"
7837,SECT. IV.,still they must have been imagined as repositories in which to lodge
7838,SECT. IV.,"traditions which had reached him, and which, however fabulously"
7839,SECT. IV.,"given, purported to be local. Again, with respect to the tradition"
7840,SECT. IV.,"of Atlas, it is scarcely possible to refuse to it a local character."
7841,SECT. IV.,"He knows the depths of every sea, and he holds or keeps the pillars"
7842,SECT. IV.,that hold heaven and earth apart. This must not be confounded with the
7843,SECT. IV.,"later representations of Atlas carrying the globe, or with his more"
7844,SECT. IV.,"purely geographical character, as representing the mountain ranges of"
7845,SECT. IV.,Northern Africa. Here he appears[428] as the keeper of the great gate
7846,SECT. IV.,"of the outer waters, namely, of the Straits of Gibraltar: that great"
7847,SECT. IV.,"gate being probably the point of connection with the ocean, and that"
7848,SECT. IV.,"outer sea being frequented exclusively by the Phœnicians, who in all"
7849,SECT. IV.,likelihood obtained from Cornwall the tin used in making the Shield of
7850,SECT. IV.,"Agamemnon, or in any of the metal manufactures of the period. Rocks"
7851,SECT. IV.,"rising on each side of a channel at the extreme point of the world, as"
7852,SECT. IV.,"it was known to Greek experience, or painted in maritime narrative,"
7853,SECT. IV.,could not be represented more naturally than as the pillars which hold
7854,SECT. IV.,up the sky. This figure follows the analogy of the pillars and walls
7855,SECT. IV.,"of a house, supporting the roof, and placed at the extremities of the"
7856,SECT. IV.,"interior of its great apartment[429]. With equal propriety, those who"
7857,SECT. IV.,"are believed alone to have reached this remote quarter, and to frequent"
7858,SECT. IV.,"it, would be said to hold those pillars[430]."
7859,SECT. IV.,
7860,SECT. IV.,"Even in a less imaginative age than that of Homer, the love of the"
7861,SECT. IV.,"marvellous, both by the givers and by the receivers of information,"
7862,SECT. IV.,"would act powerfully in colouring all narratives, of which the scene"
7863,SECT. IV.,was laid in tracts unknown except to the narrator. But a more powerful
7864,SECT. IV.,"motive might be found in that spirit of monopoly, which is so highly"
7865,SECT. IV.,"characteristic of the earlier stages, in particular, of the development"
7866,SECT. IV.,"of commerce[431]. To clothe their relations in mystery and awe, by the"
7867,SECT. IV.,"aid both of natural and supernatural wonders, would be, for a people"
7868,SECT. IV.,"possessed of an exclusive navigation, a powerful means of deterring"
7869,SECT. IV.,"competitors, and of maintaining secure hold upon profits either"
7870,SECT. IV.,legitimate or piratical.
7871,SECT. IV.,
7872,SECT. IV.,"We have before us these facts in evidence: on the one hand, a people"
7873,SECT. IV.,"who in maritime enterprise had far surpassed all others, and had a"
7874,SECT. IV.,virtual monopoly of the knowledge of the waters and countries lying
7875,SECT. IV.,"beyond a certain narrow circle. Then, on the other hand, we have"
7876,SECT. IV.,"a multitude of adventures laid by Homer in this outer sphere, and"
7877,SECT. IV.,associated wholly with the persons and places that belong to it. Upon
7878,SECT. IV.,"these grounds it seems hardly possible to avoid the conclusion, that"
7879,SECT. IV.,"the Phœnicians must have been the people from whom Homer drew, whether"
7880,SECT. IV.,"directly or mediately, his information respecting the outer circle of"
7881,SECT. IV.,the geography of the Odyssey. Such is the judgment of Strabo. He says
7882,SECT. IV.,τοὺς δὲ Φοίνικας λέγω μηνυτάς; he considers that even before the time
7883,SECT. IV.,of Homer they were masters of the choice parts of Spain and Africa: and
7884,SECT. IV.,it appears that the traces of their colonization remained until his
7885,SECT. IV.,day[432].
7886,SECT. IV.,
7887,SECT. IV.,_Traditions of the Outer Geography._
7888,SECT. IV.,
7889,SECT. IV.,"But further; the traditions themselves bear other unequivocal marks,"
7890,SECT. IV.,"besides their lying in parts known to Phœnicians only, of a Phœnician"
7891,SECT. IV.,"character; and whether these marks were attached by Homer, or came"
7892,SECT. IV.,"ready made into his hands, has no bearing upon the present argument."
7893,SECT. IV.,
7894,SECT. IV.,I have spoken of the tradition of Atlas; and of the likelihood that
7895,SECT. IV.,the Phœnicians would cast a veil over the regions of which they knew
7896,SECT. IV.,"the profitable secrets. In conformity with these ideas, the island of"
7897,SECT. IV.,"Ogygia is the island of Calypso, the Concealer: and this Calypso is the"
7898,SECT. IV.,daughter of Atlas.
7899,SECT. IV.,
7900,SECT. IV.,"Phæacia is, in the Odyssey, the geographical middle term between the"
7901,SECT. IV.,discovered and the undiscovered world; Ogygia is the stage beyond
7902,SECT. IV.,"it, and the stage on this side of it is Ithaca. I do not understand"
7903,SECT. IV.,the Phæacians to be a portrait of the Phœnicians[433]: but the very
7904,SECT. IV.,resemblance of name is enough to show that Homer had this people in
7905,SECT. IV.,"his eye when he endowed his ethereal islanders with the double gift,"
7906,SECT. IV.,"first, of unrivalled nautical excellence, and, secondly, of forming the"
7907,SECT. IV.,medium of communication between the interior space bounded by the Greek
7908,SECT. IV.,"horizon, and the parts which lay beyond it."
7909,SECT. IV.,
7910,SECT. IV.,_Minos the ὀλοόφρων._
7911,SECT. IV.,
7912,SECT. IV.,But in many instances we find Homer’s peculiar and characteristic use
7913,SECT. IV.,"of epithets the surest guide to his meaning. Now in Minos we have,"
7914,SECT. IV.,"according to Homer, a firmly grounded point of contact with Phœnicia."
7915,SECT. IV.,"Of Minos, as the friend of Jupiter, and the Judge of the defunct, we"
7916,SECT. IV.,must from the poems form a favourable impression. Yet is Ariadne Μίνωος
7917,SECT. IV.,θυγάτηρ ὀλοόφρονος. What is the meaning of the word ὀλοόφρων? I think
7918,SECT. IV.,"an examination of the use of kindred words will show, that in the mind"
7919,SECT. IV.,"of Homer it does not mean anything actually wicked or criminal, but"
7920,SECT. IV.,"hard, rigid, inexorable; or astute, formidable to cope with, one who"
7921,SECT. IV.,"takes merciless advantage, who holds those with whom he deals to the"
7922,SECT. IV.,"letter of the bond; and, in consequence, often entails on them heavy"
7923,SECT. IV.,detriment.
7924,SECT. IV.,
7925,SECT. IV.,"In this view, it would be an epithet natural and appropriate for a"
7926,SECT. IV.,"people, who represented commerce at a time when it so frequently"
7927,SECT. IV.,"partook of the characters of unscrupulous adventure, war, and plunder;"
7928,SECT. IV.,and an epithet which might pass to Minos as one of the great figures
7929,SECT. IV.,"in their history, or as a conqueror. Again, it is worth while to"
7930,SECT. IV.,review Homer’s use of the adjective ὀλοός. This epithet is applied by
7931,SECT. IV.,"him to the lion, the boar, and the water-snake[434]. Achilles, when"
7932,SECT. IV.,"complaining of Apollo for having drawn him away from the Trojan wall,"
7933,SECT. IV.,"calls him θεῶν ὀλοώτατε πάντων[435]. Menelaus, combating with Paris,"
7934,SECT. IV.,"when his sword breaks in his hand, complains of Jupiter that no god"
7935,SECT. IV.,"is ὀλοώτερος[436]. Philætius, in the Twentieth Odyssey, astonished"
7936,SECT. IV.,"that Jupiter does not take better care of good men, uses the same"
7937,SECT. IV.,"words[437]. And Menelaus applies the same epithet to Antilochus, who"
7938,SECT. IV.,has stolen an advantage over him in the chariot-race[438]. In the
7939,SECT. IV.,"positive degree, it is applied to old age, fire, fate, night, battle,"
7940,SECT. IV.,"to Charybdis (Od. xii. 113), and even to the hostile intentions of a"
7941,SECT. IV.,"god, such as the ὀλοὰ φρονέων of Apollo (Il. xvi. 701), and in θεῶν"
7942,SECT. IV.,ὀλοὰς διὰ βουλὰς (Od. xi. 275).
7943,SECT. IV.,
7944,SECT. IV.,But the characteristic force of the epithet applied to Minos becomes
7945,SECT. IV.,"most clear, and its effect in stamping a Phœnician character upon"
7946,SECT. IV.,"certain traditions undeniable, when we examine the remaining instances"
7947,SECT. IV.,"of its use; and likewise that of the cognate, indeed nearly synonymous,"
7948,SECT. IV.,phrase ὀλοφώïα εἰδώς.
7949,SECT. IV.,
7950,SECT. IV.,Only two persons besides Minos receive in Homer the epithet
7951,SECT. IV.,"ὀλοόφρων[439]. One of them is Atlas, the father of Calypso: the other"
7952,SECT. IV.,"is Æetes, the brother of Circe. Again, the phrase ὀλοφώïα εἰδὼς"
7953,SECT. IV.,is applied to Proteus[440]; and it is used nowhere else except by
7954,SECT. IV.,"Melanthius, where he means to describe Eumæus as a person dangerous"
7955,SECT. IV.,"and to be suspected[441]. Again, the ὀλοφώïα of Proteus are his"
7956,SECT. IV.,tricks[442]: and moreover we have the ὀλοφώïα δήνεα of Circe[443].
7957,SECT. IV.,Thus it would appear that Homer virtually confines these epithets
7958,SECT. IV.,"within one particular circle of traditions; for Proteus, Æetes, Circe,"
7959,SECT. IV.,"Atlas, all belong to the Outer Geography of the Odyssey[444]: and the"
7960,SECT. IV.,"use of one of them for Minos, with his already presumable Phœnician"
7961,SECT. IV.,"extraction[445], leads us, in concurrence with many other signs, to"
7962,SECT. IV.,"conclude that the epithet is strictly characteristic, and the circle"
7963,SECT. IV.,"of traditions Phœnician. One of the slightest, is also perhaps one of"
7964,SECT. IV.,the most curious and satisfactory signs of the Phœnicianism of the
7965,SECT. IV.,whole scheme. Tiresias is employed in the Eleventh Odyssey to predict
7966,SECT. IV.,to Ulysses his coming fortunes: and in doing it he uses many of the
7967,SECT. IV.,"very lines, which are afterwards prophetically spoken by Circe. Now"
7968,SECT. IV.,why is Tiresias made the informant of Ulysses? He is nowhere else
7969,SECT. IV.,"mentioned in the poems; yet he is introduced here, in possession of"
7970,SECT. IV.,the only gift of prophecy permitted in the nether world. Why have we
7971,SECT. IV.,"not rather Amphiaraus, or Polupheides, those Seers at the top of all"
7972,SECT. IV.,"mortal renown[446]? Surely there can be but one reason; namely, that"
7973,SECT. IV.,"Tiresias was a Theban, a native of the only Greek State, except Crete,"
7974,SECT. IV.,where he could have been the subject of a Phœnician dynasty[447]. It
7975,SECT. IV.,"was doubtless this Phœnician connection, which qualified him to speak"
7976,SECT. IV.,"of regions, of which a Greek Seer would, in right of his nation, have"
7977,SECT. IV.,possessed no knowledge.
7978,SECT. IV.,
7979,SECT. IV.,Nor is it only upon the epithets that we may rely; but upon the
7980,SECT. IV.,"characters, too, of those to whom they are appropriated. They are full"
7981,SECT. IV.,"of the elements of cunning and deception. Proteus, Circe, Calypso,"
7982,SECT. IV.,"the Sirens, the Læstrygones, the Cyclopes, all partake of this"
7983,SECT. IV.,"element, while in some it is joined with violence, and in others"
7984,SECT. IV.,with refinement or sensuality. In all of these we recognise so many
7985,SECT. IV.,variations of the one Phœnician type.
7986,SECT. IV.,
7987,SECT. IV.,"It has been observed, that Virgil seems to recognise Proteus as an"
7988,SECT. IV.,"eastern counterpart of Atlas, in the lines"
7989,SECT. IV.,
7990,SECT. IV.,"Atrides Protei Menelaus ad usque columnas, &c."
7991,SECT. IV.,
7992,SECT. IV.,This is a recognition by Virgil of the Phœnician character of the
7993,SECT. IV.,tradition: but I see no evidence that Homer meant to place Proteus and
7994,SECT. IV.,Atlas in relations to one another as representing the East and West of
7995,SECT. IV.,"the Mediterranean, though this theory is adopted by Nägelsbach[448] and"
7996,SECT. IV.,others.
7997,SECT. IV.,
7998,SECT. IV.,"The office of the god Mercury, and his relationship to Calypso, will be"
7999,SECT. IV.,found to confirm these conclusions[449].

8001,SECT. IV.,_Commercial aptitude of modern Greeks._
8002,SECT. IV.,
8003,SECT. IV.,"The moral signs of the Greek character, though not identical with"
8004,SECT. IV.,"those of the Phœnician, yet establish a resemblance between them; in"
8005,SECT. IV.,"so far that both possessed vigour, hardihood, and daring, and that"
8006,SECT. IV.,"the intelligence, which directed and sustained these great qualities,"
8007,SECT. IV.,was susceptible of alliance with craft. In the censure upon the
8008,SECT. IV.,"πρηκτῆρες, which Homer has conveyed through the mouth of Euryalus,"
8009,SECT. IV.,we may read a genuine effusion of his own nature: but the gifts of
8010,SECT. IV.,"Mercury to Autolycus appear to show, that the Phœnician character"
8011,SECT. IV.,"easily amalgamated with the Greek by its cunning, as well as by its"
8012,SECT. IV.,"strength. And certainly we may well marvel at the tenacity of tissue,"
8013,SECT. IV.,"with which these characters were formed, when we find that still, after"
8014,SECT. IV.,"the lapse of three thousand years, one race is distinguished beyond"
8015,SECT. IV.,all others for aptitude and energy in prosecuting the pursuits of
8016,SECT. IV.,"honourable commerce; that in England, now the centre of the trade of"
8017,SECT. IV.,"the whole world, the Greeks of the present day alike excel all other"
8018,SECT. IV.,"foreigners who frequent her great emporia, and the children of her own"
8019,SECT. IV.,energetic and persevering people; themselves perhaps the offspring of
8020,SECT. IV.,"the Thesprotians, who went for corn to Dulichium; of the Taphians, who"
8021,SECT. IV.,"carried swarthy iron to Temese; of the Cretans, who made much money in"
8022,SECT. IV.,"Egypt; and of the Lemnians, who obtained metals, hides, captives, and"
8023,SECT. IV.,"even oxen, in return for their wine, from the jovial Greeks of the army"
8024,SECT. IV.,before Troy.
8025,SECT. IV.,
8026,SECT. IV.,"The more we attempt an examination of the geography of the Odyssey, the"
8027,SECT. IV.,"more we find that, impossible as it is to reconcile with the actual"
8028,SECT. IV.,"distribution of earth and sea, it has marks of being derived from the"
8029,SECT. IV.,"nation, who navigated in the remote waters where its scenes are laid."
8030,SECT. IV.,The fundamental article of the whole is the circumscription of the
8031,SECT. IV.,"known seas by the great river Ocean, which, alike in the Iliad and"
8032,SECT. IV.,"the Odyssey, flows round and round the earth, returning upon itself,"
8033,SECT. IV.,"ἀψόρροος[450], like what is called an endless rope. And the two keys,"
8034,SECT. IV.,"as I believe, to the comprehension of it are to be found in the double"
8035,SECT. IV.,"hypothesis,"
8036,SECT. IV.,
8037,SECT. IV.,"(1) That Homer placed to the northward of Thrace, Epirus, and the"
8038,SECT. IV.,"Italian peninsula, an expanse, not of land, but of sea, communicating"
8039,SECT. IV.,"with the Euxine. Or, to express myself in other words, that he greatly"
8040,SECT. IV.,"extended the Euxine westwards, perhaps also shortening it towards"
8041,SECT. IV.,"the east; and that he made it communicate, by the Gulfs of Genoa and"
8042,SECT. IV.,"Venice, with the southern Mediterranean."
8043,SECT. IV.,
8044,SECT. IV.,(2) That he compounded into one two sets of Phœnician traditions
8045,SECT. IV.,"respecting the Ocean-mouth, and fixed the site of them in the North"
8046,SECT. IV.,East.
8047,SECT. IV.,
8048,SECT. IV.,"It would carry us too far from the line of ethnological inquiry, were"
8049,SECT. IV.,I now to examine the extensive question with which these propositions
8050,SECT. IV.,"are connected. I will only observe in this place, that all the features"
8051,SECT. IV.,"of this outer geography, when viewed at large, are of such a nature"
8052,SECT. IV.,"as to favour, or perhaps rather to compel, the supposition, that it"
8053,SECT. IV.,"was founded on foreign, that is to say, on Phœnician information. Its"
8054,SECT. IV.,"extended range, its reach, by the routes of Menelaus on the one side,"
8055,SECT. IV.,"and of Ulysses on the other, over all the points of the compass, its"
8056,SECT. IV.,"vague, indeterminate, and ungeographical character as to distances and"
8057,SECT. IV.,"directions, and yet its frequent, though inconsistent and confused,"
8058,SECT. IV.,"resemblances at almost every point to some actual prototype, of which"
8059,SECT. IV.,the poet may have had possibly or probably a vision in his eye;--all
8060,SECT. IV.,"this agrees with the belief, that it represents a highly manufactured"
8061,SECT. IV.,"work, made up from Phœnician materials, and can scarcely agree with any"
8062,SECT. IV.,thing else.
8063,SECT. IV.,
8064,SECT. IV.,"Reserving this much agitated subject for a fuller separate discussion,"
8065,SECT. IV.,I will here only proceed to consider that limited portion of it which
8066,SECT. IV.,bears upon ethnology; I mean the evidence afforded us by Homer in the
8067,SECT. IV.,"Odyssey, and particularly in connection with the Wanderings, as to"
8068,SECT. IV.,the site and character (1) of the Siceli and of Sicania: (2) of the
8069,SECT. IV.,"Thesprotians and Epirus: and (3) with respect to the family of Cadmus,"
8070,SECT. IV.,which general tradition connects immediately with Phœnicia in the
8071,SECT. IV.,"person of its founder, and which Homer, by indirect testimony, I think,"
8072,SECT. IV.,justifies us in considering as derived from that source.
8073,SECT. IV.,
8074,SECT. IV.,
8075,SECT. IV.,_The Siceli and Sicania._
8076,SECT. IV.,
8077,SECT. IV.,"Notwithstanding his use of the name Thrinacie, the poet appears to"
8078,SECT. IV.,"have had no geographical knowledge of Sicily, at least beyond its"
8079,SECT. IV.,shape; for I think it may be shown that he places the site of the
8080,SECT. IV.,island in the immediate neighbourhood of the Bosphorus. But he might
8081,SECT. IV.,"still have heard of the eastern coast of Italy immediately adjoining,"
8082,SECT. IV.,"afterwards the country of the Bruttii, which forms the sole of the foot"
8083,SECT. IV.,rudely described by the configuration of southern Italy. For this coast
8084,SECT. IV.,is much nearer to Greece; it probably would be taken by mariners on
8085,SECT. IV.,"their way from Greece to Sicily, and might be visited by them before"
8086,SECT. IV.,they had pushed their explorations to the more distant point. The
8087,SECT. IV.,Athenian fleet in the Peloponnesian war touched first at the Iapygian
8088,SECT. IV.,"promontory, and then coasted all the way[451]. This possibility grows"
8089,SECT. IV.,"nearly into a certainty, when we find that Homer speaks of a race,"
8090,SECT. IV.,"evidently as transmarine, which from history would appear probably to"
8091,SECT. IV.,have inhabited that region at some early period.
8092,SECT. IV.,
8093,SECT. IV.,"I venture to argue that this Bruttian coast, the sole of the Italian"
8094,SECT. IV.,"foot, reaching from the gulf of Tarentum down to Rhegium, is the"
8095,SECT. IV.,country which appears to us in the Odyssey under the name of Sicania.
8096,SECT. IV.,
8097,SECT. IV.,In the fabulous account which Ulysses gives of himself to his father
8098,SECT. IV.,"Laertes before the Recognition, he speaks as follows:"
8099,SECT. IV.,
8100,SECT. IV.,"εἶμι μὲν ἐξ Ἀλύβαντος, ὅθι κλυτὰ δώματα ναίω,"
8101,SECT. IV.,υἷος Ἀφείδαντος Πολυπημονίδαο ἄνακτος·
8102,SECT. IV.,αὐτὰρ ἐμοί γ’ ὄνομ’ ἐστὶν Ἐπήριτος· ἀλλά με δαίμων
8103,SECT. IV.,πλάγξ’ ἀπὸ Σικανίης δεῦρ’ ἐλθέμεν οὐκ ἐθέλοντα·
8104,SECT. IV.,νηὺς δέ μοι ἥδ’ ἕστηκεν ἐπ’ ἀγροῦ νόσφι πόληος[452].
8105,SECT. IV.,
8106,SECT. IV.,"In this passage Ulysses represents himself as a mariner, driven by"
8107,SECT. IV.,some cross wind out of his course into Ithaca. Now this implies that
8108,SECT. IV.,his point of departure should be one from which by a single change of
8109,SECT. IV.,"wind he could easily be driven upon Ithaca. Again, Sicania must have"
8110,SECT. IV.,"been a region known to the Ithacans, or else, instead of merely naming"
8111,SECT. IV.,"it, he would have described it to Laertes, as he describes Crete to"
8112,SECT. IV.,Penelope[453].
8113,SECT. IV.,
8114,SECT. IV.,"Now, to fulfil these conditions, no other country than the one I have"
8115,SECT. IV.,"named is available. It has only an open sea between it and Greece, and"
8116,SECT. IV.,"a passage of some two hundred or two hundred and fifty miles, so that"
8117,SECT. IV.,a wind driving him from his course might readily carry him across. And
8118,SECT. IV.,"there is no other tract on the western side of the Adriatic, which is"
8119,SECT. IV.,"so likely to have been intended by Homer. Iapygia, beyond the Tarentine"
8120,SECT. IV.,"gulf, lies northward even of Scheria; and, like Scheria, so Iapygia"
8121,SECT. IV.,"was, we may be assured, in the Outer or unknown sphere of geography for"
8122,SECT. IV.,Homer.
8123,SECT. IV.,
8124,SECT. IV.,"On the other hand, the Bruttian coast might well be known in Greece,"
8125,SECT. IV.,"though by dim rumour, yet better than Sicily: first, because it was"
8126,SECT. IV.,"nearer; and secondly, inasmuch as it did not in the same manner"
8127,SECT. IV.,"present the appearance of an island, its bearings would be more easily"
8128,SECT. IV.,"determined, and therefore its site was less likely to be mistaken."
8129,SECT. IV.,"Lastly, history assures us that the Sicanian name prevailed in Italy,"
8130,SECT. IV.,before it passed over into Sicily. Therefore the country of the Bruttii
8131,SECT. IV.,is in all likelihood the Homeric Sicania.
8132,SECT. IV.,
8133,SECT. IV.,"But again, we hear in Homer of Σικελοὶ, though not of a Σικελία. The"
8134,SECT. IV.,Suitors advise Telemachus to send his guests to the Σικελοὶ[454] for
8135,SECT. IV.,"sale: adding that a good price, a renumerating price (ἄξιον), would"
8136,SECT. IV.,"thus be obtained for them. On the other hand, a Sicelian female slave"
8137,SECT. IV.,"is the wife of Dolios, and looks after Laertes in his old age[455]."
8138,SECT. IV.,
8139,SECT. IV.,"From these passages we may infer,"
8140,SECT. IV.,
8141,SECT. IV.,1. That the country of the Σικελοὶ was within the remoter knowledge of
8142,SECT. IV.,Ithacan seamen.
8143,SECT. IV.,
8144,SECT. IV.,2. That they were a rich people; since they were able to pay a good
8145,SECT. IV.,price for slaves.
8146,SECT. IV.,
8147,SECT. IV.,"The first point, as we have seen, would make the Σικελοὶ suitable"
8148,SECT. IV.,inhabitants of Sicania.
8149,SECT. IV.,
8150,SECT. IV.,"But likewise as to the second, Homer has given us some indications of"
8151,SECT. IV.,their wealth: (_a_) in the name Ἀφείδας (the open-handed) ascribed by
8152,SECT. IV.,Ulysses to his father; (_b_) in that of Ἐπήριτος (object of contention)
8153,SECT. IV.,"assumed for himself; (_c_) perhaps also in the name Ἀλύβας, akin to"
8154,SECT. IV.,"that of Ἀλύβη[456], where there was silver, and to that of Ἀρύβας a"
8155,SECT. IV.,rich Sidonian[457]. This name probably indicates the possession of
8156,SECT. IV.,"metallic mines, which for that period we may consider as a special sign"
8157,SECT. IV.,of advancement and opulence.
8158,SECT. IV.,
8159,SECT. IV.,"Then if we turn for a moment to the historic period, it is in this very"
8160,SECT. IV.,country that we find planted the great and luxurious cities of Sybaris
8161,SECT. IV.,and Crotona[458].
8162,SECT. IV.,
8163,SECT. IV.,"Now as the people called Siceli, and the country called Sicania, are"
8164,SECT. IV.,"thus placed in relations of proximity by Homer, so they continue"
8165,SECT. IV.,throughout all antiquity. The reports collected by Thucydides represent
8166,SECT. IV.,"the Sicanians as giving their name to Sicily, and displacing the former"
8167,SECT. IV.,"name Trinacria, which is identical with the Homeric Thrinacie. At a"
8168,SECT. IV.,"later time, the Sicilians passed from Italy into Sicily, and, as was"
8169,SECT. IV.,"said, upon rafts; that is to say, across the strait, and consequently"
8170,SECT. IV.,"from the country which, as I contend, is the Homeric Sicania. These"
8171,SECT. IV.,"Siceli were rumoured to have overcome the Sicani, and to have again"
8172,SECT. IV.,changed the name of the island to Sicily. It is yet more material to
8173,SECT. IV.,"note, that Thucydides says there were still Siceli in Italy when he"
8174,SECT. IV.,"himself lived: and he adds the tradition that Italus, a king of theirs,"
8175,SECT. IV.,gave his name to the Peninsula[459].
8176,SECT. IV.,
8177,SECT. IV.,"To these reports, which form a part of the account given by Thucydides,"
8178,SECT. IV.,"we may add the statement of Dionysius, that the Σικελοὶ were the oldest"
8179,SECT. IV.,"inhabitants of Latium, and were displaced by the Pelasgi[460]. This"
8180,SECT. IV.,"implies their movement southward, and makes it probable that we should"
8181,SECT. IV.,"meet them in Bruttium, on their way to Sicily, perhaps pressing, in"
8182,SECT. IV.,"that region, upon the Sicani."
8183,SECT. IV.,
8184,SECT. IV.,"Such an hypothesis would be in entire agreement with Homer, who"
8185,SECT. IV.,evidently represents the Sicanian as older than the Sicelian name: for
8186,SECT. IV.,"the first had become territorial, when the latter was only tribal or"
8187,SECT. IV.,national. And all this is in agreement with Thucydides in the essential
8188,SECT. IV.,"point, that he makes the Sicanians precede the Siceli: while, though"
8189,SECT. IV.,the tradition he reports brings the Sicani from Spain under pressure
8190,SECT. IV.,"from the Ligures[461], he need not mean to exclude the supposition,"
8191,SECT. IV.,that they may have come by land down the Italian peninsula. Though it
8192,SECT. IV.,"is probably wrong to confound the Siceli with the Sicani[462], it would"
8193,SECT. IV.,"thus on all hands appear, that they were but successive waves of the"
8194,SECT. IV.,tide of immigration advancing southward.
8195,SECT. IV.,
8196,SECT. IV.,There is a further evidence that Homer meant to place Sicania within
8197,SECT. IV.,"the Greek maritime world, and not beyond it. It is this. In his"
8198,SECT. IV.,"fabulous narrative to Laertes, Ulysses apprises the old man, that he"
8199,SECT. IV.,"had seen his son five years before in Sicania, hopeful of reaching his"
8200,SECT. IV.,home[463]. Now this is a proof that the place was in the Inner or
8201,SECT. IV.,"known sphere of geography: for in the outer circle, as for instance at"
8202,SECT. IV.,"Æolia, he never has any knowledge or reckoning of his own as to the"
8203,SECT. IV.,power of reaching home: it was Æolus who gave him the Zephyr to take
8204,SECT. IV.,"him home, not he who knew that if he got a Zephyr he would reach home."
8205,SECT. IV.,And in like manner he is supplied with express directions by Calypso:
8206,SECT. IV.,"while Menelaus, not being absolutely beyond the known world, has no"
8207,SECT. IV.,"instructions for his voyage from Proteus, who plays for him the part of"
8208,SECT. IV.,divine informant.
8209,SECT. IV.,
8210,SECT. IV.,"Thus then it appears, that Homer knew something of that part of the"
8211,SECT. IV.,"Italian continent, which we may term the sole of the foot. Again,"
8212,SECT. IV.,"if we look onward to the heel, Iapygia or Apulia, and observe its"
8213,SECT. IV.,"proximity to Corcyra or Scheria, we shall perceive that mariners in"
8214,SECT. IV.,"the time of Homer might take the route, which was afterwards pursued"
8215,SECT. IV.,by the Athenian fleet under Nicias and his colleagues. But this is
8216,SECT. IV.,"conjectural; and as Scheria was so faintly known, we must suppose"
8217,SECT. IV.,Apulia to have been still more faintly conceived. Beyond Apulia Homer
8218,SECT. IV.,gives no sign of any acquaintance whatever with Italy. It therefore
8219,SECT. IV.,at once appears possible that he had no idea of the junction by land
8220,SECT. IV.,"between the Greek and Italian peninsulas, and that he had imaged to"
8221,SECT. IV.,"the northward only an expanse of sea. I postpone, however, the further"
8222,SECT. IV.,discussion of this subject.

8228,SECT. IV.,
8229,SECT. IV.,"The Ithacan Suitors threaten to send Irus (Od. xviii. 84, 115), and"
8230,SECT. IV.,"again Ulysses (Od. xxi. 307), to a certain lawless and cruel king"
8231,SECT. IV.,named Echetus; and in the two first passages we have the additional
8232,SECT. IV.,indication ἤπειρόνδε. This expression used in Ithaca can refer to no
8233,SECT. IV.,other mainland than that of the Greek Peninsula: of which even the
8234,SECT. IV.,nearer parts[464] pass by that name.
8235,SECT. IV.,
8236,SECT. IV.,"As on the one hand Echetus is savage, and evidently foreign (for we"
8237,SECT. IV.,"never find a Greek sold by Greeks as a slave to a Greek), he must be"
8238,SECT. IV.,"beyond the Greek limit: doubtless beyond the Thesproti, who were allies"
8239,SECT. IV.,"(ἄρθμιοι, Od. xvi. 427) of Ithaca. On the other hand, he could not"
8240,SECT. IV.,"be remote, or the Suitors would not have spoken so glibly of sending"
8241,SECT. IV.,"persons there. Hence we can hardly doubt, that this Echetus was a"
8242,SECT. IV.,"sovereign in the region of Epirus, between Scheria and the Thesproti:"
8243,SECT. IV.,and the territorial name Ἤπειρος may thus be at least as ancient as the
8244,SECT. IV.,Poet.
8245,SECT. IV.,
8246,SECT. IV.,In like manner we find in the Sixth Odyssey a female slave named
8247,SECT. IV.,"Eurymedusa, in the household of Alcinous, the old nurse of Nausicaa."
8248,SECT. IV.,"She was brought by sea Ἀπείρηθεν, and is described as γρηῢς"
8249,SECT. IV.,Ἀπειραίη[465]. This is probably meant to indicate some part of the same
8250,SECT. IV.,region.
8251,SECT. IV.,

8253,SECT. IV.,"Homer’s line of vanishing points, or extreme limits of actual"
8254,SECT. IV.,"geography, towards the north-west and west of Greece. To trace these"
8255,SECT. IV.,"vanishing points all round the circuit of his horizon, whenever it"
8256,SECT. IV.,"can be done, is most useful towards establishing the fundamental"
8257,SECT. IV.,"distinction between his Inner and Outer, his practical and poetical"
8258,SECT. IV.,"geography. In order to mark that distinction more forcibly, I would, if"
8259,SECT. IV.,"I might venture it, even call the former of these alone Geography, and"
8260,SECT. IV.,the latter his territorial Skiagraphy.
8261,SECT. IV.,
8262,SECT. IV.,More nearly within the circle of every day intercourse with Greece than
8263,SECT. IV.,"the barbarous Echetus and his Epirus, and yet hovering near the verge"
8264,SECT. IV.,"of it, are the Thesprotians of the Odyssey."
8265,SECT. IV.,
8266,SECT. IV.,"Ulysses, in the Fourteenth Book, in the course of his fabulous"
8267,SECT. IV.,"narrative to Eumæus, relates that, when he was on his way from Crete"
8268,SECT. IV.,"to Libya, the ship in which he was sailing foundered, but that, by the"
8269,SECT. IV.,"favour of Jupiter, he floated on the mast for nine days, and, on the"
8270,SECT. IV.,"tenth, reached the land of the Thesprotians."
8271,SECT. IV.,
8272,SECT. IV.,_Thesproti in Homer._
8273,SECT. IV.,
8274,SECT. IV.,This statement suffices to fix that people to the north of the gulf
8275,SECT. IV.,"of Ambracia (Arta). For had they lain to the south of that gulf, this"
8276,SECT. IV.,"would not have been the first land for him to make, as it would have"
8277,SECT. IV.,been covered by the islands.
8278,SECT. IV.,
8279,SECT. IV.,The narrative which follows is very curious. The Thesprotian king
8280,SECT. IV.,"Pheidon, according to the tale of Ulysses, took good care of him"
8281,SECT. IV.,"without making him a slave (ἐκομίσσατο ἀπριάτην); which, as he was cast"
8282,SECT. IV.,"helpless on the shore, common usage would apparently have justified,"
8283,SECT. IV.,"and even suggested. The king’s son, who found him in his destitute"
8284,SECT. IV.,"condition, had his share in this great kindness; for he took him home,"
8285,SECT. IV.,"like Nausicaa, and clothed him. Here, says the tale, he heard news"
8286,SECT. IV.,"of Ulysses, who had proceeded from thence to Dodona to inquire about"
8287,SECT. IV.,"his fate, and had left much valuable property in trust with these"
8288,SECT. IV.,"hospitable and worthy people. But he goes on to relate, still in the"
8289,SECT. IV.,"assumed character, that, instead of keeping him to wait for Ulysses,"
8290,SECT. IV.,the Thesprotian king took advantage of the opportunity afforded by a
8291,SECT. IV.,"Thesprotian ship about to sail to Dulichium for corn, and dispatched"
8292,SECT. IV.,"him by it as a passenger to his home. The crew, however, infected with"
8293,SECT. IV.,"the kidnapping propensities of navigators, maltreated and bound him,"
8294,SECT. IV.,"with the intention of selling him for a slave: but, when they landed on"
8295,SECT. IV.,"the Ithacan beach to make a meal, he took advantage of the opportunity,"
8296,SECT. IV.,and made his escape[466].
8297,SECT. IV.,
8298,SECT. IV.,"This ingenious fable is referred to, and in part repeated in subsequent"
8299,SECT. IV.,"passages of the poem[467], with no material addition, except that the"
8300,SECT. IV.,country is called (πίων δῆμος xix. 271) a rich one.
8301,SECT. IV.,
8302,SECT. IV.,"But another passage[468], quite independent of all the former, adds"
8303,SECT. IV.,"a highly characteristic incident. Antinous, the insolent leader of"
8304,SECT. IV.,"the Suitors, is sharply rebuked by Penelope, and is reminded that"
8305,SECT. IV.,his father Eupeithes had come to the palace as a fugitive from the
8306,SECT. IV.,"Ithacan people, dependent on Ulysses for deliverance from their wrath."
8307,SECT. IV.,"The reason of their exasperation was, that Eupeithes had joined"
8308,SECT. IV.,the buccaneering Taphians in a piratical expedition against the
8309,SECT. IV.,"Thesprotians, who were allies of Ithaca."
8310,SECT. IV.,
8311,SECT. IV.,"We have here a very remarkable assemblage of characteristics, which all"
8312,SECT. IV.,"tend to prove, and I think very sufficiently prove, the Pelasgianism"
8313,SECT. IV.,of the Thesprotians. The humane and genial reception of the stranded
8314,SECT. IV.,sea-farer is in exact accordance with the behaviour of the Egyptian
8315,SECT. IV.,"king[469], and his people to him on a previous occasion. The fact that"
8316,SECT. IV.,"he was not enslaved, suggests it as most probable, that there were no"
8317,SECT. IV.,slaves in the Thesprotian country: which would entirely accord with
8318,SECT. IV.,"the position of the Pelasgians, as themselves not the conquerors of a"
8319,SECT. IV.,"race that had preceded them, but the first inhabitants of the spots"
8320,SECT. IV.,they occupied in the Greek peninsula. The richness of their country
8321,SECT. IV.,"is further in harmony with the account of Egypt, and with their"
8322,SECT. IV.,addiction to agricultural pursuits. The feigned deposit by Ulysses of
8323,SECT. IV.,"his metallic stores with them proves, that they were not a predatory,"
8324,SECT. IV.,"and therefore proves, for that period, that they were not a poor"
8325,SECT. IV.,"people. The name Pheidon, or thrifty, given to the king, agrees with"
8326,SECT. IV.,"the character which, as we shall elsewhere find, attaches in a marked"
8327,SECT. IV.,"manner to Pelasgian proper names. And lastly, they were the subject of"
8328,SECT. IV.,attack by Taphian buccaneers; which tends to show their unoffending and
8329,SECT. IV.,unaggressive character.
8330,SECT. IV.,
8331,SECT. IV.,"On the other side, we find them trading by sea to Dulichium: and we"
8332,SECT. IV.,find the crew of the trader attempting to kidnap Ulysses. But as the
8333,SECT. IV.,"Pelasgians were not in general navigators, it may very well have"
8334,SECT. IV.,happened that the trade of the country had fallen into the hands of
8335,SECT. IV.,"some distinct, possibly some Lelegian, or even some Hellenic race,"
8336,SECT. IV.,which may have settled there for the purpose of carrying on a congenial
8337,SECT. IV.,"employment, and which, like other traders of the time, would be ready"
8338,SECT. IV.,upon occasion to do a turn in the way of piracy. It is to be remembered
8339,SECT. IV.,"that there was a Thesprotian[470] Ephyre; which proves, as I believe,"
8340,SECT. IV.,an early infusion of some race connected with the Hellenic stem.
8341,SECT. IV.,
8342,SECT. IV.,"I conclude, therefore, from Homer, that the Thesprotians were"
8343,SECT. IV.,Pelasgian. And this conclusion is strongly sustained by the
8344,SECT. IV.,"extra-Homeric tradition. Herodotus states, that they were the parent"
8345,SECT. IV.,"stock from whence descended the Thessalians[471], a report which I only"
8346,SECT. IV.,follow to the extent of its signifying an affinity between the early
8347,SECT. IV.,settlers on the two sides of Mount Pindus. And Dionysius[472] appears
8348,SECT. IV.,"to imply the opinion, that they were Thesprotian Pelasgians who settled"
8349,SECT. IV.,in Italy.
8350,SECT. IV.,
8351,SECT. IV.,"I have already stated, that I can hardly think Homer points out to"
8352,SECT. IV.,us more than one Dodona in the Iliad and Odyssey respectively. At
8353,SECT. IV.,"the same time, if the supposition of two Dodonas be admissible, the"
8354,SECT. IV.,circumstances suggested by him would help to account for it. For the
8355,SECT. IV.,Dodona of the Iliad is described as Pelasgic and also Hellic: that
8356,SECT. IV.,"is, as we must I think suppose, having been Pelasgic, it had become"
8357,SECT. IV.,"Hellic. The Dodona of the Odyssey (on this supposition) is Thesprotian,"
8358,SECT. IV.,"that is to say Pelasgic, only. The solution would then be, that the"
8359,SECT. IV.,"Pelasgians of the original Dodona, when displaced, claimed to have"
8360,SECT. IV.,"carried their oracle along with them, while the Hellic intruders in"
8361,SECT. IV.,like manner set up a counter-claim to have retained it in its original
8362,SECT. IV.,seat. The history of Christendom supplies us with cases bearing no
8363,SECT. IV.,"remote analogy to this, in connection with the removal of a great seat"
8364,SECT. IV.,of ecclesiastical power.

8369,SECT. IV.,_Cadmeans in Homer._
8370,SECT. IV.,
8371,SECT. IV.,We have seen that the name of Ino Leucothee is sufficiently identified
8372,SECT. IV.,"with a circle of Phœnician and outer-world traditions. And, as her"
8373,SECT. IV.,"name and position give us directly, or by suggestion, the principal"
8374,SECT. IV.,"testimony borne by Homer to Cadmus her father, this will be the most"
8375,SECT. IV.,convenient place for considering his connection with Greece.
8376,SECT. IV.,
8377,SECT. IV.,"We are justified, I think, in at once assuming, first, from his"
8378,SECT. IV.,"relation to Ino, that he was Phœnician; secondly, from the deification"
8379,SECT. IV.,"of his daughter, that he was a ruler or prince. And thirdly, Ino"
8380,SECT. IV.,"appears to Ulysses in his distress as a protecting deity. Now as, when"
8381,SECT. IV.,"mortal, she had been Phœnician by extraction, and as she thus shows her"
8382,SECT. IV.,"sympathies with the Hellenic race, we must assume a link between these"
8383,SECT. IV.,"two facts. They would be associated in an appropriate manner, if the"
8384,SECT. IV.,family of Cadmus her father had become naturalized in the possession of
8385,SECT. IV.,a Greek sovereignty.
8386,SECT. IV.,
8387,SECT. IV.,"Diodorus Siculus has handed down a tradition respecting Cadmus[473],"
8388,SECT. IV.,which is important from its combination with circumstantial evidence;
8389,SECT. IV.,"and which is in harmony with Homer, as it appears to represent the"
8390,SECT. IV.,Phœnician immigrant at a well known and natural resting-place on his
8391,SECT. IV.,"way towards Greece. It is to the effect, that Cadmus put into Rhodes,"
8392,SECT. IV.,built there a temple of Neptune (and here we should remember the
8393,SECT. IV.,"worship, and, as some think, the temple of Neptune[474] in Scheria),"
8394,SECT. IV.,"established a line of hereditary priests, and deposited offerings to"
8395,SECT. IV.,"Minerva of Lindos. Among these, there remained in after-times a finely"
8396,SECT. IV.,"wrought kettle or caldron, executed in an antique style of art, and"
8397,SECT. IV.,bearing an inscription in the Phœnician character.
8398,SECT. IV.,
8399,SECT. IV.,"In connection with the name of Cadmus, we have the Homeric designations"
8400,SECT. IV.,of Καδμεῖοι and Καδμείωνες. They appear to be synonymous: but the
8401,SECT. IV.,patronymical form of the latter corroborates the opinion that there
8402,SECT. IV.,"was an individual Cadmus from whom the names proceeded, that they were"
8403,SECT. IV.,"properly dynastic, and not names taken from a nation or extended race."
8404,SECT. IV.,
8405,SECT. IV.,We have next to inquire as to the period within which this race of
8406,SECT. IV.,"Cadmeans held sway in Bœotia, the district where alone we hear of them."
8407,SECT. IV.,"When did they begin, and when did they close?"
8408,SECT. IV.,
8409,SECT. IV.,The extra-Homeric tradition would throw Cadmus back to one of the very
8410,SECT. IV.,"earliest periods, which would appear to be included within Homer’s"
8411,SECT. IV.,knowledge upwards. The generations are arranged as follows:
8412,SECT. IV.,
8413,SECT. IV.,1. Cadmus.
8414,SECT. IV.,2. Polydorus.
8415,SECT. IV.,3. Labdacus.
8416,SECT. IV.,4. Laius.
8417,SECT. IV.,5. Œdipus.
8418,SECT. IV.,6. Eteocles and Polynices.
8419,SECT. IV.,
8420,SECT. IV.,The last-named brothers are contemporaries of Tydeus. It follows that
8421,SECT. IV.,Cadmus is placed seven generations before the Trojan war; he is made
8422,SECT. IV.,"contemporary with Dardanus, and he appears in Greece about three and a"
8423,SECT. IV.,half generations before Minos came to Crete.
8424,SECT. IV.,
8425,SECT. IV.,"Now this is not the presumption, to which the Homeric text would"
8426,SECT. IV.,"give rise. For it does not seem likely that, if a family of an"
8427,SECT. IV.,"active race like the Phœnicians made their way into Greece, and"
8428,SECT. IV.,managed to establish a sovereignty within it seven generations before
8429,SECT. IV.,"the _Troica_, upwards of a century should elapse before any other"
8430,SECT. IV.,adventurer was found to repeat so advantageous a process.
8431,SECT. IV.,
8432,SECT. IV.,"Further, the Cadmeans were in Thebes. But Cadmus was not its founder."
8433,SECT. IV.,"It was founded, as we are told in the Eleventh Odyssey[475], by Zethus"
8434,SECT. IV.,"and Amphion, sons of Jupiter and of Antiope, daughter of Asopus: two"
8435,SECT. IV.,"persons who have thus, on both sides of their parentage, the signs"
8436,SECT. IV.,of being the first known of their own race in the country. From the
8437,SECT. IV.,"appearance of Antiope in the Νεκυΐα, where none but Hellenic and"
8438,SECT. IV.,"naturalized Shades are admitted, we may infer that Amphion and Zethus"
8439,SECT. IV.,"were not Pelasgian but Hellene. Again, as they _first_ founded and"
8440,SECT. IV.,"fortified Thebes, they must have preceded Cadmus there. What then was"
8441,SECT. IV.,their probable date?
8442,SECT. IV.,
8443,SECT. IV.,"In the Νεκυΐα, so far as regards the women, Homer gives some appearance"
8444,SECT. IV.,of meaning to introduce the persons and groups in chronological order.
8445,SECT. IV.,
8446,SECT. IV.,"The first of them all is Tyro[476], who seems to have been of the"
8447,SECT. IV.,"family of Æolus, and to have lived about four generations before the"
8448,SECT. IV.,_Troica_.
8449,SECT. IV.,
8450,SECT. IV.,"The next is Antiope, mother of Amphion and Zethus."
8451,SECT. IV.,
8452,SECT. IV.,"After her come (1) Alcmene, mother of Hercules,"
8453,SECT. IV.,
8454,SECT. IV.,"(2) Epicaste, mother of Œdipus, and"
8455,SECT. IV.,
8456,SECT. IV.,"(3) Chloris, mother of Nestor."
8457,SECT. IV.,
8458,SECT. IV.,All of whom belong to a period three generations before the war.
8459,SECT. IV.,
8460,SECT. IV.,"After these follow Leda and Ariadne, with others whose epoch the text"
8461,SECT. IV.,"of Homer does not enable us to fix. But Ariadne, the bride of Theseus,"
8462,SECT. IV.,"and aunt of Idomeneus (the μεσαιπόλιος), stands at about one generation"
8463,SECT. IV.,"and a half before the war: and Leda, as the mother of Castor and Pollux"
8464,SECT. IV.,"who were dead, and of Helen whose marriageable age dated from so many"
8465,SECT. IV.,"years before the action of the Iliad, as well as of Clytemnestra,"
8466,SECT. IV.,belongs to about the same date.
8467,SECT. IV.,
8468,SECT. IV.,"On the whole therefore it would appear, from the signs of chronological"
8469,SECT. IV.,"order, that Antiope can hardly have been older than Tyro, and therefore"
8470,SECT. IV.,"can only have been about four, and her sons about three generations"
8471,SECT. IV.,"before the War. We have no vestiges of their race in Homeric history,"
8472,SECT. IV.,"except that, in the Nineteenth Odyssey[477], there is recorded the"
8473,SECT. IV.,"death of Itylus, the son of Zethus, in his boyhood. The Amphion Iasides"
8474,SECT. IV.,"of Od. xi. 283, must be another person. But, if this reasoning be"
8475,SECT. IV.,"sound, Cadmus, who succeeds to them in Thebes, was probably much more"
8476,SECT. IV.,"recent than the later tradition makes him, and may have come into"
8477,SECT. IV.,Greece only a short time before Minos.
8478,SECT. IV.,
8479,SECT. IV.,"His name appears to have been given as a dynastic name to his subjects,"
8480,SECT. IV.,"or the ruling class of them, and to have continued such under his"
8481,SECT. IV.,"descendants. For not only does it appear to have begun with him, but"
8482,SECT. IV.,with the fall of the family it at once disappears.
8483,SECT. IV.,
8484,SECT. IV.,"In five different places of the poems, Homer has occasion to refer to"
8485,SECT. IV.,"occurrences, which took place at Thebes under the Cadmean dynasty,"
8486,SECT. IV.,in the time of Œdipus and of his sons: and in these five passages he
8487,SECT. IV.,employs the names Καδμεῖοι and Καδμείωνες no less than eight times for
8488,SECT. IV.,"the people, while he never calls them by any other name[478]."
8489,SECT. IV.,
8490,SECT. IV.,"But when we come down to the time of the war, this dynasty has"
8491,SECT. IV.,"disappeared with Eteocles and Polynices: the country of Bœotia, which"
8492,SECT. IV.,"it had once governed, seems to have lost its cohesion, and its troops"
8493,SECT. IV.,"are led by a body of no less than five chiefs. And now, whenever Homer"
8494,SECT. IV.,"has occasion to refer to the inhabitants of the country, they are never"
8495,SECT. IV.,"Καδμεῖοι or Καδμείωνες, but they are Βοιωτοί. The words Βοιωτὸς and"
8496,SECT. IV.,Βοιώτιος are found nine times in the Iliad.
8497,SECT. IV.,
8498,SECT. IV.,"Nations called by a name which is derived from a national source, are"
8499,SECT. IV.,likely to retain it longer than those which are designated dynastically
8500,SECT. IV.,from the head of a ruling family: as they must change their dynasties
8501,SECT. IV.,"more frequently than they can receive new infusions of race and blood,"
8502,SECT. IV.,powerful enough to acquire a predominance over the old.
8503,SECT. IV.,
8504,SECT. IV.,"Strabo indeed says[479], that Homer calls the Cadmeans of the Troic"
8505,SECT. IV.,"war by the name of Minyæ. But no Minyæ are named in Homer at all,"
8506,SECT. IV.,"although he speaks of the Ὀρχόμενος Μινυήïος, and of the ποταμὸς"
8507,SECT. IV.,"Μινυήïος in Peloponnesus, and though there was perhaps there also a"
8508,SECT. IV.,"Minyan Orchomenos. Even if Minyæ were named in Homer as a race, it"
8509,SECT. IV.,"would be strange that Homer should without a reason alter, for the"
8510,SECT. IV.,"period of the war, that use of the Cadmean name, to which he adheres"
8511,SECT. IV.,"elsewhere so strictly, as to show that he is acting on a rule. Whereas"
8512,SECT. IV.,"the transition to Βοιωτοὶ is not only intelligible, but politically"
8513,SECT. IV.,descriptive.
8514,SECT. IV.,
8515,SECT. IV.,Upon the foregoing facts we may found several observations:
8516,SECT. IV.,
8517,SECT. IV.,1. The Cadmean name would seem to be strictly dynastic: as it makes its
8518,SECT. IV.,"first appearance on the spot where Cadmus has reigned, and disappears"
8519,SECT. IV.,"at the same point, along with the extinction of his family."
8520,SECT. IV.,
8521,SECT. IV.,"2. The use of the Cadmean name by Homer, compared with his departure"
8522,SECT. IV.,"from it, each having appropriate reference to the circumstances of"
8523,SECT. IV.,"different epochs, appears to be a marked example of a careful and"
8524,SECT. IV.,historic manner of handling local names with reference to the exact
8525,SECT. IV.,"circumstances of place, time, and persons, and not in the loose manner"
8526,SECT. IV.,of later poetry.
8527,SECT. IV.,
8528,SECT. IV.,3. Our whole view of Cadmus and the Cadmeans from Homer has been
8529,SECT. IV.,"attained by circuitous inference: and, presuming it to be a just"
8530,SECT. IV.,"one, we have here a very singular example of the poet’s reticence"
8531,SECT. IV.,with respect to all infusion of foreign blood and influence into his
8532,SECT. IV.,country.

8679,SECT. V.,_On the Catalogue._
8680,SECT. V.,
8681,SECT. V.,
8682,SECT. V.,The Catalogue in the Second Book belongs more properly to the
8683,SECT. V.,"Geography, than to the Ethnology of the poems. But I advert to it here"
8684,SECT. V.,"on account both of the historic matter it contains, and of the manner"
8685,SECT. V.,in which it illustrates the general historic designs of the Poet.
8686,SECT. V.,
8687,SECT. V.,"It is perhaps, in its own way, nearly as characteristic and remarkable"
8688,SECT. V.,"a performance, as any among the loftier parts of the poem. Considered"
8689,SECT. V.,"as a portion of the Iliad, it would be more justly termed the Array"
8690,SECT. V.,"than the Catalogue; for it is a review, and not a mere enumeration."
8691,SECT. V.,"Considered with respect to history, its value can scarcely be"
8692,SECT. V.,overrated: it contains the highest title-deeds of whatever ancient
8693,SECT. V.,"honour the several States might claim, and is in truth the Doomsday"
8694,SECT. V.,Book of Greece.
8695,SECT. V.,
8696,SECT. V.,We may consider the Greek Catalogue in three parts:
8697,SECT. V.,
8698,SECT. V.,"First, the Invocation or Preface."
8699,SECT. V.,
8700,SECT. V.,"Secondly, the Catalogue Proper."
8701,SECT. V.,
8702,SECT. V.,"Thirdly, the Postscript, so to call it, 761-779."
8703,SECT. V.,
8704,SECT. V.,"Before and after, he has graced the work with splendid similes. When"
8705,SECT. V.,"all is concluded and, as it were, marked off, he proceeds to append to"
8706,SECT. V.,"it the Trojan Catalogue; a work of less extent and difficulty, as also"
8707,SECT. V.,"of less penetrating interest to his hearers, but yet constructed with"
8708,SECT. V.,"much of care, and with various descriptive embellishments."
8709,SECT. V.,
8710,SECT. V.,The Preface contains the most formal invocation of the Muses among the
8711,SECT. V.,"few which are to be found in the poems. The others are,"
8712,SECT. V.,
8713,SECT. V.,Il. i. 1. Introduction to the Iliad: addressed to Θεά.
8714,SECT. V.,
8715,SECT. V.,Il. ii. 761. In the Postscript to the Catalogue.
8716,SECT. V.,
8717,SECT. V.,Il. xi. 218. Before the recital of the persons who were slain by
8718,SECT. V.,Agamemnon.
8719,SECT. V.,
8720,SECT. V.,"Il. xiv. 508. Before the recital of the Greek chiefs, who, on the"
8721,SECT. V.,"turn of the battle, slew various Trojans."
8722,SECT. V.,
8723,SECT. V.,"Il. xvi. 112. Before proceeding to relate, how the Trojans hurled the"
8724,SECT. V.,firebrands at the Grecian ships.
8725,SECT. V.,
8726,SECT. V.,Od. i. 1. Introduction to the Odyssey: addressed to Μοῦσα.
8727,SECT. V.,
8728,SECT. V.,"In the cases of the Eleventh and Fourteenth Books, the invocation of"
8729,SECT. V.,the Muse stands in connection with a particular effort of memory; for
8730,SECT. V.,the recitals prefaced by it consist of names not connected by any
8731,SECT. V.,natural tie one with the other. But it is here that the Poet’s appeal
8732,SECT. V.,to the Muse most deserves attention.
8733,SECT. V.,
8734,SECT. V.,"If Homer was composing a written poem, the invocation is ill-timed and"
8735,SECT. V.,"unmeaning. He has already, by a series of fine similes, elevated the"
8736,SECT. V.,"subject to a proper level. Considered as a mere written Catalogue, it"
8737,SECT. V.,does not deserve or account for the prayer for aid: in this point of
8738,SECT. V.,"view, it was of necessity among the _sermoni propiora_, and was one of"
8739,SECT. V.,the easiest parts of the poem to compose. But if we consider the poem
8740,SECT. V.,"as a recitation, then the Catalogue was very difficult; because of the"
8741,SECT. V.,"great multitude of details which are included in it, and which are not"
8742,SECT. V.,in themselves connected together by any natural or obvious link.
8743,SECT. V.,
8744,SECT. V.,"It is true that he begs the Muses to inform him, because they were"
8745,SECT. V.,"omnipresent and omniscient, whereas he is dependent on report only"
8746,SECT. V.,(κλέος) for information. Now this was equally true of the whole
8747,SECT. V.,material of the poem: but the reason why he introduces the statement of
8748,SECT. V.,"this truth in so marked a manner, must be from the arduous nature of"
8749,SECT. V.,"the task he was beginning; nor could it be arduous in any other way,"
8750,SECT. V.,than as an effort of memory.
8751,SECT. V.,
8752,SECT. V.,The invocation contains another proof that the poems were composed for
8753,SECT. V.,"recitation in the words (vv. 489, 90)"
8754,SECT. V.,
8755,SECT. V.,"οὐδ’ εἴ μοι δέκα μὲν γλῶσσαι, δέκα δὲ στόματ’ εἶεν"
8756,SECT. V.,"φωνὴ δ’ ἄρρηκτος, χαλκέον δέ μοι ἦτορ ἐνείη."
8757,SECT. V.,
8758,SECT. V.,Nothing can be more proper than to refer to the insufficient ability
8759,SECT. V.,"of the bodily organs of recitation, if he were about to recite: but"
8760,SECT. V.,"nothing less proper, if he were engaged on a written poem. It has been"
8761,SECT. V.,"a fashion however with poets to copy Homer in this passage, although"
8762,SECT. V.,the reason and circumstances on which it is founded had become wholly
8763,SECT. V.,inapplicable: and their abusive imitation has blinded us to the
8764,SECT. V.,significance of the passage as it stands in the Iliad.
8765,SECT. V.,
8766,SECT. V.,Now as regards the list itself.
8767,SECT. V.,
8768,SECT. V.,_The Greek Array._
8769,SECT. V.,
8770,SECT. V.,"In this Catalogue, he had to go through the different States of Greece,"
8771,SECT. V.,"furnishing twenty-nine contingents of various strengths, all indicated"
8772,SECT. V.,"by the number of ships, to the army. These contingents are under"
8773,SECT. V.,"forty-five leaders, many of them with genealogies, and coming from one"
8774,SECT. V.,hundred and seventy-one Greek towns. The proper names of the Greek
8775,SECT. V.,"Catalogue, strictly so called, are three hundred and ninety-six, and"
8776,SECT. V.,"those of the Trojan one hundred and five, making in all five hundred"
8777,SECT. V.,"and one. These must have been a selection from a larger number, for"
8778,SECT. V.,"there were Greek towns (for example Φηραὶ of the Peloponnesus, Od. iii."
8779,SECT. V.,"488, and the various towns named Ἐφύρη) not named in the Catalogue;"
8780,SECT. V.,and this again increased the difficulty of keeping by memory to the
8781,SECT. V.,"list throughout. Again, it was difficult to adopt any arrangement"
8782,SECT. V.,"that should not be wholly arbitrary, in displaying to us the parts of"
8783,SECT. V.,"an army which comprised so many divisions, and which was drawn from"
8784,SECT. V.,"sources so numerous, and dispersed over a territory of such extremely"
8785,SECT. V.,irregular formation.
8786,SECT. V.,
8787,SECT. V.,_The principle of arrangement._
8788,SECT. V.,
8789,SECT. V.,Homer has however with great ingenuity adopted a geographical
8790,SECT. V.,"arrangement in the Greek Catalogue, which, so far as the various"
8791,SECT. V.,"divisions were concerned, has enabled him to combine them into a kind"
8792,SECT. V.,of whole.
8793,SECT. V.,
8794,SECT. V.,"The territory, which supplied the army, consisted partly of continent,"
8795,SECT. V.,"and partly of islands: and the islands again were partly such as, lying"
8796,SECT. V.,"about the coast of the mainland, might be most conveniently remembered"
8797,SECT. V.,"in conjunction with it, partly such as formed a group of themselves."
8798,SECT. V.,
8799,SECT. V.,"If we take the continent and islands together, we shall find that they"
8800,SECT. V.,"form part of a curvilinear figure, not indeed circular, but elliptical,"
8801,SECT. V.,and more nearly approaching a circle than that group of islands in
8802,SECT. V.,"the Ægean, which afterwards obtained the name of Cyclades. This name,"
8803,SECT. V.,"taken from the rude approximation to a geometrical figure, may possibly"
8804,SECT. V.,have been at first suggested to the Greeks by Homer’s geometrical
8805,SECT. V.,arrangement in the Catalogue. I speak of Homer’s arrangement as
8806,SECT. V.,"geometrical, because the principle he has adopted is that of mental"
8807,SECT. V.,"figure drawing: it is of course of the rudest kind, and he perhaps did"
8808,SECT. V.,not even know the correct mode of constructing a circle.
8809,SECT. V.,
8810,SECT. V.,The proportion of the figure formed by the mainland and islands is
8811,SECT. V.,about two-thirds of a complete circumference: the ends of the curve
8812,SECT. V.,"being Thessaly to the north, and Calydnæ, with the other small"
8813,SECT. V.,"islands, in the south-east."
8814,SECT. V.,
8815,SECT. V.,"Let us now proceed to notice, firstly, the primary division of the"
8816,SECT. V.,"Catalogue into principal parts, and secondly, the subdivision in each"
8817,SECT. V.,of those parts.
8818,SECT. V.,
8819,SECT. V.,"It is worth while to remark, that the Poet has not adopted the mode"
8820,SECT. V.,"of enumeration which might have been thought most obvious: namely, to"
8821,SECT. V.,"begin at one of the extremities of this semicircle (so to call it), and"
8822,SECT. V.,then proceed towards the other. If the territorial subdivisions had
8823,SECT. V.,"been regular, this would have been convenient: but from their utter"
8824,SECT. V.,irregularity it would in this case have been wholly useless.
8825,SECT. V.,
8826,SECT. V.,"Again, he might have begun with Agamemnon, his immediate forces and"
8827,SECT. V.,dominion; and might then proceed through the States according to the
8828,SECT. V.,political importance of their respective contingents. But to this
8829,SECT. V.,"course there were two objections. First, their order could not on this"
8830,SECT. V.,"principle have been easily decided, especially after passing a few"
8831,SECT. V.,"of the most considerable. But, secondly, he appears to have avoided,"
8832,SECT. V.,"with a fixed purpose and with an extraordinary skill, both here and"
8833,SECT. V.,"elsewhere, whatever could have excited feelings of jealousy as between"
8834,SECT. V.,the several States of Greece. Of course I do not refer to the admitted
8835,SECT. V.,supremacy of Agamemnon: but if he had attempted to place the forces
8836,SECT. V.,"of Nestor, Diomed, Menelaus, of the Athenians, the Arcadians, the"
8837,SECT. V.,"Phthians, in an order thus regulated, it would have been at variance"
8838,SECT. V.,"with obvious prudence, and with his uniform rule of action. Perhaps,"
8839,SECT. V.,"however, we may rightly consider, that if Homer had been writing his"
8840,SECT. V.,"poems, he could not have failed to give Agamemnon the first place"
8841,SECT. V.,in this description. He has not then followed the general form of
8842,SECT. V.,"the territory, nor has he begun with the chief political member of"
8843,SECT. V.,"the armament. Nor, lastly, has he even treated the Peloponnesus as a"
8844,SECT. V.,"separate division of Greece: but he has introduced it, though it was"
8845,SECT. V.,"the most important part of the country, between the eastern parts"
8846,SECT. V.,"(Bœotia, with six other States) and the western parts (Ætolia, with two"
8847,SECT. V.,other States) of Middle Greece.
8848,SECT. V.,
8849,SECT. V.,"There are therefore various modes of arrangement, which either"
8850,SECT. V.,"politically or geographically might be termed obvious, but which the"
8851,SECT. V.,Poet has passed by. Why has he passed them by? and why has he begun the
8852,SECT. V.,"Catalogue with the Bœotians? who were neither powerful, nor ancient,"
8853,SECT. V.,nor distinguished in a remarkable degree; nor did they lie at any one
8854,SECT. V.,of the geographical extremities of the country.
8855,SECT. V.,
8856,SECT. V.,"Again, it might be asked, why has he not either divided all the"
8857,SECT. V.,"islands from Continental Greece, or none? Instead of that, he reckons"
8858,SECT. V.,"Eubœa, Cephallenia, Zacynthus, and Ithaca, in the same division with"
8859,SECT. V.,"Continental Greece, but begins a new division with Crete."
8860,SECT. V.,
8861,SECT. V.,"Let us now carefully note what he has done, and see whether it does not"
8862,SECT. V.,suggest the reasons.
8863,SECT. V.,
8864,SECT. V.,The three principal divisions of the Catalogue would appear to lie as
8865,SECT. V.,follows:
8866,SECT. V.,
8867,SECT. V.,"I. Continental Greece south of mount Œta, including the Middle and the"
8868,SECT. V.,"Southern division, with the islands immediately adjacent. This section"
8869,SECT. V.,furnishes sixteen contingents. (Il. ii. 494-644.)
8870,SECT. V.,
8871,SECT. V.,"II. Insular Greece, from Crete to Calydnæ: these islands furnish four"
8872,SECT. V.,contingents. (645-680.)
8873,SECT. V.,
8874,SECT. V.,"III. Thessalian Greece, from Œta and Othrys in the south, to Olympus in"
8875,SECT. V.,the north: which furnishes nine contingents. (681-759.)
8876,SECT. V.,
8877,SECT. V.,These three divisions completely sever the line of the semicircular
8878,SECT. V.,curve. It follows that in recitation he would be able to dispose of
8879,SECT. V.,"each part severally, as each forms a compact figure of itself: and this"
8880,SECT. V.,"he could not have done, had he followed the seemingly more natural"
8881,SECT. V.,division into continent and islands. At the interval between the first
8882,SECT. V.,"and the second, he makes a spring from Ætolia to Crete: and another"
8883,SECT. V.,"between the second and the third, from the Calydnæ to Thessaly."
8884,SECT. V.,
8885,SECT. V.,"The _desideratum_ obviously was, to assist memory by such a"
8886,SECT. V.,"geographical disposition, that the different parts might be made by"
8887,SECT. V.,association each to suggest that which was immediately to follow. So
8888,SECT. V.,"distributed, they would supply a kind of _memoria technica_."
8889,SECT. V.,
8890,SECT. V.,"We see how he prepares for this operation by his distribution in chief,"
8891,SECT. V.,"which gives him the three sections of Greece, as they succeed one"
8892,SECT. V.,another on the line of the (completed) figure.
8893,SECT. V.,
8894,SECT. V.,"And, though we may not yet have in view a reason for his beginning"
8895,SECT. V.,"with the Bœotians, we seem now at least to have a reason before us for"
8896,SECT. V.,his beginning with the middle section instead of one of the extremes;
8897,SECT. V.,"namely, that it was the principal one, as it not only supplied the"
8898,SECT. V.,"largest number of ships and men, and nearly all the greater commanders,"
8899,SECT. V.,"but also as it contains the seat of sovereignty, and supplied the"
8900,SECT. V.,forces of the Chief of the army.
8901,SECT. V.,
8902,SECT. V.,"Having the three sections before us, let us now observe the manner in"
8903,SECT. V.,"which he manages the sub-distribution, so as to make each district of"
8904,SECT. V.,territory lead him on to the next.
8905,SECT. V.,
8906,SECT. V.,"And here he seems evidently to proceed upon these two rules: first,"
8907,SECT. V.,"never to pass over an intervening territory, though he may cross a"
8908,SECT. V.,strait or gulf.
8909,SECT. V.,
8910,SECT. V.,"And secondly, to throw the several States into rude circles or other"
8911,SECT. V.,"figures, round the arc or along the line of which his recollection"
8912,SECT. V.,moves from point to point.

9045,FIGURE V.,"great minuteness, seems to have noticed the circular arrangement:"
9046,FIGURE V.,"at least he speaks of the κύκλος τῆς Θετταλίας, and the περιόδεια"
9047,FIGURE V.,"τῆς χώρας[485]. But when he comes to the sixth division, that of"
9048,FIGURE V.,"Eurypylus, he appears to find it impossible to fix with any confidence"
9049,FIGURE V.,"the site of Ormenium: and says, καὶ ἄλλα δ’ ἐστὶν ἃ λέγοι τις ἂν,"
9050,FIGURE V.,"ἀλλ’ οὖν ὀκνῶ διατρίβειν ἐπὶ πλέον[486]. And further on he observes,"
9051,FIGURE V.,"that the displacements and changes of cities, and mixtures of races,"
9052,FIGURE V.,"have confounded the names and tribes[487], so as to make them in part"
9053,FIGURE V.,unintelligible to men of his day: where we are anew reminded of the
9054,FIGURE V.,"passage of Thucydides, in which he tells us, that the most fertile"
9055,FIGURE V.,tracts underwent the most frequent changes of population[488].
9056,FIGURE V.,
9057,FIGURE V.,The δυναστεία of Eurypylus is in our maps commonly placed on the sea
9058,FIGURE V.,"coast, but as it appears, with little authority of any kind: while,"
9059,FIGURE V.,"after all the proof we have seen of continuous arrangement, it seems"
9060,FIGURE V.,"incredible that, in this instance alone, Homer could have followed an"
9061,FIGURE V.,order such that the δυναστεία should not march either with that which

9064,FIGURE V.,
9065,FIGURE V.,"To judge from analogy with the otherwise uniform rule of the Catalogue,"

9079,FIGURE V.,
9080,FIGURE V.,"In this view Homer appears to subdivide Thessaly into two figures,"
9081,FIGURE V.,as he had done Southern Greece: and in both cases one of them is

9084,FIGURE V.,
9085,FIGURE V.,"I have described this geometrical arrangement, as of great interest"

9106,FIGURE V.,
9107,FIGURE V.,"In the first place, such proof is afforded by the immense amount of its"
9108,FIGURE V.,"details, which are _prima facie_ a load upon his verse, and which Homer"
9109,FIGURE V.,"seems to have so regarded, from the care he has taken to relieve the"
9110,FIGURE V.,subject by the cluster of similes at the beginning. He must have had a
9111,FIGURE V.,purpose in facing this disadvantage. It is quite at variance with his
9112,FIGURE V.,"own spirit, and the spirit of his age, to suppose that this purpose was"

9118,FIGURE V.,"maintained, there is no other alternative but that of an historical"
9119,FIGURE V.,purpose.
9120,FIGURE V.,
9121,FIGURE V.,"Viewed at large, the Catalogue is an answer to that normal question,"
9122,FIGURE V.,which expresses the anxiety of every Greek to make the acquaintance

9127,FIGURE V.,
9128,FIGURE V.,The chief indication of departure from this purpose is in the case of
9129,FIGURE V.,Nireus[491]. This paltry leader is almost the only person of legitimate
9130,FIGURE V.,"birth, both of whose parents are named: and while he is evidently"
9131,FIGURE V.,"introduced for his beauty only, it is most suspicious that his father"
9132,FIGURE V.,"should be named Χάροψ, and likewise his mother Ἀγλαΐη. This savours of"
9133,FIGURE V.,"the names Δημόδοκος and Τερπιάδης, which Homer has given to his Bards"
9134,FIGURE V.,"in the Odyssey. And again of his Phronius, son of Noemon, whom he"
9135,FIGURE V.,introduces to play the part of a considerate and serviceable Ithacan
9136,FIGURE V.,"citizen[492]. With the insignificant island of Syme Homer might, for"
9137,FIGURE V.,"a special object, well take this liberty. And we may observe here, as"
9138,FIGURE V.,"elsewhere, that what is probably a departure from literal truth, may"
9139,FIGURE V.,also be in a higher view historical: for doubtless his object is to
9140,FIGURE V.,"commemorate impressively the wonderful beauty of Nireus, and this he"
9141,FIGURE V.,does by inventing appropriate accessories.
9142,FIGURE V.,
9143,FIGURE V.,"Again, though an accurate geography would not of itself have proved"
9144,FIGURE V.,"the personal parts of the narrative to be historical, it is scarcely"
9145,FIGURE V.,"conceivable that he would have adopted one so minute and elaborate, as"
9146,FIGURE V.,"well as exact, if he had meant to combine with it a string of merely"
9147,FIGURE V.,fictitious personalities.
9148,FIGURE V.,
9149,FIGURE V.,_Genealogies of the Catalogue._
9150,FIGURE V.,
9151,FIGURE V.,"Thirdly, besides many simple patronymics, there are found thirteen"
9152,FIGURE V.,"minor genealogies in the Catalogue, ten of them Greek, and three"

9154,FIGURE V.,"single exception of the Orchomenian leaders, who have four: and in"
9155,FIGURE V.,"every case they attach to secondary heroes, who are thus treated in a"
9156,FIGURE V.,"mass, while provision is made in other parts of the poem for making"
9157,FIGURE V.,known to us the descent (with the exception of Ajax) of all the greater
9158,FIGURE V.,"heroes, as occasion serves to state it for each of them singly. Now"
9159,FIGURE V.,"it is inconceivable, even on general grounds, that the poet should"
9160,FIGURE V.,have invented this mass of names; for they could surely have excited
9161,FIGURE V.,"no sort of interest among his hearers, except upon one ground. They"
9162,FIGURE V.,"must have been true genealogical records of persons, who had played a"
9163,FIGURE V.,"part in the great national drama; one not perhaps of high importance,"
9164,FIGURE V.,"yet sufficient to be the basis of such traditions, as are justly"
9165,FIGURE V.,deemed worthy of local record among a people eminently strong in their

9191,FIGURE V.,"The second of these cases, if we are to regard the passage containing"

9194,FIGURE V.,"Nireus, whether true persons or not, are evidently named with reference"
9195,FIGURE V.,"to the consideration of beauty only, which is the key to the whole"
9196,FIGURE V.,passage.
9197,FIGURE V.,
9198,FIGURE V.,And the parentage of Æneas may also perhaps be named for the sole

9204,FIGURE V.,"gods for their fathers; nor is there any case, among the Greeks, of"
9205,FIGURE V.,"illegitimate birth from a goddess. Of the five other cases three (1,"
9206,FIGURE V.,"3, and 6), are obviously illegitimate births, one at least of them"
9207,FIGURE V.,with a fabulous father. This raises the presumption that the name of
9208,FIGURE V.,the mother was mentioned as the only remaining means of recording the
9209,FIGURE V.,descent: inasmuch as the persons would otherwise have been οὐτίδανοι.
9210,FIGURE V.,"It may reasonably be conjectured, that all these births were out of"
9211,FIGURE V.,wedlock.
9212,FIGURE V.,
9213,FIGURE V.,The epithets of the Catalogue are so accurately descriptive of the
9214,FIGURE V.,"country, that they have always been used as tests of the traditions"
9215,FIGURE V.,respecting the situations of the places to which they refer. They are
9216,FIGURE V.,not less exactly in harmony with the descriptions in other parts of
9217,FIGURE V.,"the poem, and this in minor cases, where purposed fiction can hardly"
9218,FIGURE V.,"be supposed, not less than in the greater ones. For instance, the"
9219,FIGURE V.,"Arcadians of Il. vii. 134, are ἐγχεσίμωροι: those of the Catalogue"
9220,FIGURE V.,"are ἀγχιμάχηται (604), and ἐπιστάμενοι πολεμίζειν (611). The Pelasgi"
9221,FIGURE V.,"of Il. x. 429 are δῖοι, those of the Catalogue (840) are ἐγχεσίμωροι."
9222,FIGURE V.,"The Cephallenians of the Catalogue are μεγάθυμοι (631), those of Il."
9223,FIGURE V.,iv. 330 are στίχες οὐκ ἀλαπαδναί. The Crete of the Odyssey (xix.
9224,FIGURE V.,"174) has ἐννήκοντα πόληες, the Crete of the Catalogue (v. 649) is"
9225,FIGURE V.,ἑκατόμπολις[493].
9226,FIGURE V.,
9227,FIGURE V.,Single commands are in every instance assigned to those who in the
9228,FIGURE V.,rest of the poem appear as chiefs of the first order. In the case of
9229,FIGURE V.,Idomeneus alone is this in any way obscured; as the passage (645-51)
9230,FIGURE V.,"runs: ‘Idomeneus led the Cretans.... Idomeneus led them, with"
9231,FIGURE V.,Meriones.’ But it is very remarkable that Meriones holds just this sort
9232,FIGURE V.,of ambiguous relation to Idomeneus in the poem at large: sometimes he
9233,FIGURE V.,"is called his θεράπων (xxiii. 113 _et alibi_), and his ὀπάων (x. 58 _et"
9234,FIGURE V.,"alibi_), while he stands among the nine first warriors of the army, who"
9235,FIGURE V.,"(vii. 161), volunteer for single combat with Hector; and when Idomeneus"
9236,FIGURE V.,"leads the van, he manages the rear (iv. 251-4). Again, though the"
9237,FIGURE V.,"opportunities afforded by the Catalogue are of necessity narrow, yet"
9238,FIGURE V.,Homer has contrived within its limits to mark distinctly the character
9239,FIGURE V.,"and position of nearly every great chieftain: certainly of Agamemnon,"
9240,FIGURE V.,"Achilles, Menelaus, Telamonian Ajax (v. 668), and Ulysses."
9241,FIGURE V.,
9242,FIGURE V.,_The Epilogue._
9243,FIGURE V.,
9244,FIGURE V.,"The third portion, or epilogue, appears to be ascribable chiefly to"
9245,FIGURE V.,the genial love of Homer for the horse. His arrangement of the army
9246,FIGURE V.,"according to the number of ships, which conveyed each division, had"
9247,FIGURE V.,"shut out the mention of the chariots and the coursers who drew them,"
9248,FIGURE V.,and he appears to have devised this closing invocation for the purpose
9249,FIGURE V.,of supplying the defect. It was certainly not necessary in order to
9250,FIGURE V.,"fix the position of Achilles in the army, which the First Book had"
9251,FIGURE V.,completely developed; and the passage is chiefly occupied with the
9252,FIGURE V.,"horses of Eumelus, together with those of Achilles and his force."
9253,FIGURE V.,
9254,FIGURE V.,"It contains, however, two remarkable notes of historical veracity. The"
9255,FIGURE V.,"horses of Eumelus, a Thessalian, are proclaimed to have been by far the"
9256,FIGURE V.,"best (μέγ’ ἄρισται): and the Myrmidons, again a Thessalian contingent,"
9257,FIGURE V.,are here spoken of as having a number of separate chariots and horses;
9258,FIGURE V.,"we are told (773), ‘the soldiers played at games.... The horses stood"
9259,FIGURE V.,"feeding, each near his own chariot, and the chariots were in their"
9260,FIGURE V.,sheds.’ This is never said of any other contingent in the army. In
9261,FIGURE V.,"strict harmony with this picture, Thessaly was conspicuous throughout"
9262,FIGURE V.,"the historic times of Greece, for the excellence of its breeds of"
9263,FIGURE V.,"horses, and the high character of its cavalry."
9264,FIGURE V.,
9265,FIGURE V.,"If all this be so, we cannot wonder at the high estimation in which the"
9266,FIGURE V.,"Catalogue of Homer was held by the Greeks of after-ages, as the great"
9267,FIGURE V.,and only systematic record of the national claims of the respective
9268,FIGURE V.,states.
9269,FIGURE V.,
9270,FIGURE V.,This was not merely literary or private estimation: the Catalogue had
9271,FIGURE V.,"the place of an authoritative public document. Under the laws of Solon,"
9272,FIGURE V.,"for example, it received the honour of public recitation on solemn"
9273,FIGURE V.,occasions. It was also quoted for the decision of controversies. In the
9274,FIGURE V.,"critical moment, which preceded the first Persian war, the Athenian and"
9275,FIGURE V.,Spartan envoys apply on the part of Greece to Gelon for his aid. He
9276,FIGURE V.,claims the command. In resisting this claim and urging their own right
9277,FIGURE V.,"to lead the fleet, unless that post be claimed by the Lacedæmonians,"
9278,FIGURE V.,"the Athenians found their pretensions on the magnitude of their fleet,"
9279,FIGURE V.,"their autochthonism, and, finally, the testimony of Homer to the merits"
9280,FIGURE V.,of Menestheus[494].
9281,FIGURE V.,
9282,FIGURE V.,_The Trojan Catalogue._
9283,FIGURE V.,
9284,FIGURE V.,The Trojan Catalogue has less of organic connection than the Greek with
9285,FIGURE V.,the structure of the poem at large.
9286,FIGURE V.,
9287,FIGURE V.,"In proceeding to this portion of his work, the poet does not renew his"
9288,FIGURE V.,"ornamental similes, or his invocation to the Muse. He evidently meant"
9289,FIGURE V.,to lower the tone of his strain: and moreover he was not about to tax
9290,FIGURE V.,"memory as he had done in the former operation, the proper names being"
9291,FIGURE V.,"only about one fourth in number of those used for the Greeks, and none"
9292,FIGURE V.,of them being arranged in long strings like the towns of Bœotia.
9293,FIGURE V.,
9294,FIGURE V.,He now begins in what may be called a natural order: taking first that
9295,FIGURE V.,"section of the army, which was supplied by the Troic sovereignties,"
9296,FIGURE V.,principal and subordinate; and among these giving the first place to
9297,FIGURE V.,"the troops of Ilion itself, as the most considerable, and as those"
9298,FIGURE V.,"chiefly concerned. The next is given to the Dardan forces, which were"
9299,FIGURE V.,"connected with the original seat of the race, and the following ones to"
9300,FIGURE V.,the contingents supplied by the subordinate sovereigns of the rest of
9301,FIGURE V.,Troas.
9302,FIGURE V.,
9303,FIGURE V.,"His pursuit of this order reminds us, that the geographical"
9304,FIGURE V.,"distribution was in the case of the Trojan list simple, and did not"
9305,FIGURE V.,"require the aid of mental geometry, as he had only to follow, almost"
9306,FIGURE V.,"throughout, a single line of States along the European and Asiatic"
9307,FIGURE V.,"coasts. It also strengthens the presumption that, when Homer chose an"
9308,FIGURE V.,"order so different, and so much less natural and obvious, in the case"
9309,FIGURE V.,"of the Greeks, he must have been governed by some peculiar reason."
9310,FIGURE V.,
9311,FIGURE V.,"It will be observed that, of the eleven divisions of the Allies, the"
9312,FIGURE V.,two first are the Pelasgians and the Thracians. As the blood of these
9313,FIGURE V.,"two races flowed likewise in the veins of the Greeks, the precedence"
9314,FIGURE V.,given to them may have been founded on this relationship. But this
9315,FIGURE V.,"presumption is qualified by our finding that, doubtless on the ground"
9316,FIGURE V.,"of geographical order, the Lycian contingent, which had, at any rate,"
9317,FIGURE V.,"strong Greek affinities, comes last of all."
9318,FIGURE V.,
9319,FIGURE V.,"For a reason given elsewhere, we must consider the numbers assigned"
9320,FIGURE V.,to the Greek contingents as approximate representations of their
9321,FIGURE V.,respective force: but the omission to particularize numbers at all in
9322,FIGURE V.,the Trojan Catalogue is itself an evidence of its historical character.
9323,FIGURE V.,The Trojan army was of a miscellaneous character: we also know that
9324,FIGURE V.,"the allied contingents went and came, and that their absence from"
9325,FIGURE V.,"home, not prompted by the same powerful motives as that of the Greeks,"
9326,FIGURE V.,was shortened by reliefs. Thus we find Rhesus with his Thracians just
9327,FIGURE V.,arrived in the Tenth Book[495]: Memnon comes to Troy after the death
9328,FIGURE V.,of Hector[496]: and we are told of the sons of Hippotion (Il. xiii.
9329,FIGURE V.,"792), who ἦλθον ἀμοιβοί, had come as reliefs, on the preceding day. An"
9330,FIGURE V.,"army thus collected piecemeal, and thus fluctuating in its composition,"
9331,FIGURE V.,"could not leave behind it the same accessible traditions. Again, the"
9332,FIGURE V.,destruction of Troy itself obliterated what alone could have been their
9333,FIGURE V.,"depository; nor had Homer, as a Greek bard, either the same motives"
9334,FIGURE V.,"or the same means for gathering detailed information, as he would"
9335,FIGURE V.,naturally possess with reference to his own countrymen.
9336,FIGURE V.,
9337,FIGURE V.,"Hence, as the Trojan Catalogue is shorter, so also its scope is more"
9338,FIGURE V.,limited. It contains no specification of forces: no anecdotes going
9339,FIGURE V.,farther back than the existing generation: scarcely any of what may
9340,FIGURE V.,be called specialties of character or position as to the chiefs. It
9341,FIGURE V.,shows a good deal of knowledge of the geography and products of the
9342,FIGURE V.,"countries, but this knowledge is of a much more general and vague"
9343,FIGURE V.,"character, than that which he has displayed in almost every portion"
9344,FIGURE V.,"of the Greek Array. He gives here very few lists of towns at all, and"
9345,FIGURE V.,never uses epithets requiring us to believe that he had a personal
9346,FIGURE V.,"knowledge of their site and character. Only Ariste is δῖα, and Larissa"
9347,FIGURE V.,is ἐριβώλαξ. In two or three cases he speaks of commercial products;
9348,FIGURE V.,a characteristic which it is obvious that he might have learned
9349,FIGURE V.,without any personal experience of the countries. He does not use
9350,FIGURE V.,this particular kind of sign at all in the descriptions of the Greek
9351,FIGURE V.,"Catalogue: and we may perhaps correctly interpret it, where it appears,"
9352,FIGURE V.,as a token of his want of vivid and experimental knowledge.
9353,FIGURE V.,
9354,FIGURE V.,He also occasionally names a mountain or a river. But there is a
9355,FIGURE V.,"general avoidance of particular and characteristic epithets, such"
9356,FIGURE V.,"as, (to refer to the Bœotian list alone,) πετρήεσσα given to Aulis,"
9357,FIGURE V.,"πολύκνημος to Eteonos, εὐρύχορος to Mycalesos, ἐϋκτίμενον to Medeon and"
9358,FIGURE V.,"Hypothebæ, πολυτρήρων to Thisbe, ποιήεις to Haliartos, πολυστάφυλος to"
9359,FIGURE V.,"Arne, ἐσχατόωσα to Anthedon, with perhaps one or two other cases."
9360,FIGURE V.,
9361,FIGURE V.,Another material inference is suggested by the very different texture
9362,FIGURE V.,of the Trojan Catalogue.
9363,FIGURE V.,
9364,FIGURE V.,"Upon the whole, this vagueness of description cannot, I think, but be"
9365,FIGURE V.,regarded as much in conflict with the belief that Homer was a Greek of
9366,FIGURE V.,"Asia Minor, if at least his comparative knowledge of the two countries"
9367,FIGURE V.,"on the opposite sides of the Ægean is to be taken as a sign, either"
9368,FIGURE V.,"positive or negative, of his nativity."

9427,SECT. VI.,
9428,SECT. VI.,"1. Ἕλληνες, Il. ii. 684.  }"
9429,SECT. VI.,"2. Πανέλληνες, ibid. 530. } National or tribal names."
9430,SECT. VI.,"3. Σελλοὶ, Il. xvi. 234.  }"
9431,SECT. VI.,
9432,SECT. VI.,"And, lastly, the territorial name of"
9433,SECT. VI.,
9434,SECT. VI.,4. Ἕλλας.
9435,SECT. VI.,
9436,SECT. VI.,Observing the order of derivation as it has been pointed out by
9437,SECT. VI.,"Mure[497], we shall naturally look to the word Ἕλλας as a guide to"
9438,SECT. VI.,"the meaning of its derivatives, Ἕλληνες and Πανέλληνες. It is itself"
9439,SECT. VI.,drawn from Ἑλλοὶ or Σελλοί: but as that name is only once used in the
9440,SECT. VI.,"Poems, and as by far the largest body of evidence tells upon the word"
9441,SECT. VI.,"Ἕλλας, the decision upon the whole group of words will turn mainly upon"
9442,SECT. VI.,the inquiry we shall have to make into the use of that word by Homer.
9443,SECT. VI.,"With it therefore we shall commence. Is there, we have to ask, clear"
9444,SECT. VI.,"proof, that it went beyond the dominions of Peleus? If it went beyond"
9445,SECT. VI.,"them, how far did it go? and did it include that division of Greece, in"
9446,SECT. VI.,"which Locris lay, whose inhabitants a particular line of the Catalogue"
9447,SECT. VI.,classes with the Panhellenes? For no suspicion of spuriousness can
9448,SECT. VI.,"justly arise out of the fact (if it be one), that Homer calls by the"
9449,SECT. VI.,"name of Hellenes the inhabitants of any country, which was itself"
9450,SECT. VI.,within the scope of the territorial name Hellas: inasmuch as this is
9451,SECT. VI.,"little more than, the word Yorkshire being given, to make use also of"
9452,SECT. VI.,the word Yorkshiremen.
9453,SECT. VI.,
9454,SECT. VI.,"At the outset, however, it is essential to observe, that a certain"
9455,SECT. VI.,elasticity in the use of geographical as well as political names could
9456,SECT. VI.,"not but belong to the age, in which Homer lived: first, because of the"
9457,SECT. VI.,"successive movements of tribes, like wave on wave, so that the use of"
9458,SECT. VI.,"any such name would ordinarily be either growing or declining, but"
9459,SECT. VI.,"not stationary: secondly, because of the indeterminate forms which"
9460,SECT. VI.,"political authority assumed, as resting on a mixture, in unknown"
9461,SECT. VI.,"proportions, of the various elements of custom, compact, reverence, and"
9462,SECT. VI.,"force: and, thirdly, because of the want of well-defined geographical"
9463,SECT. VI.,boundaries.
9464,SECT. VI.,
9465,SECT. VI.,"We are not entitled to assume that the territory, which we call Greece,"
9466,SECT. VI.,"was, in Homer’s time, subdivided with precision between a given number"
9467,SECT. VI.,"of territorial names. We hear of Phthia, Ægialus, Elis, Arcadia:"
9468,SECT. VI.,but these seem to be the exceptions rather than the rule. For many
9469,SECT. VI.,parts of it there are no local names whatever; and we must not look
9470,SECT. VI.,for any thing resembling the manner in which England is made up of
9471,SECT. VI.,"its counties, France of its departments, or the later Greece of its"
9472,SECT. VI.,individual states.

9523,SECT. VI.,
9524,SECT. VI.,"Of these passages, there are some which admit for the word Hellas"
9525,SECT. VI.,"the contracted sense of the dominions of Peleus, or even of a simple"
9526,SECT. VI.,portion of them. Namely the following:
9527,SECT. VI.,
9528,SECT. VI.,"In (1) we are reading part of the description of the country, from"
9529,SECT. VI.,which the force of Achilles was drawn. Beginning from the line which
9530,SECT. VI.,"precedes it, we may translate thus: ‘the inhabitants of Alos, and of"
9531,SECT. VI.,"Alope, and of Trachin, and those who occupied Phthia, and the Hellas"
9532,SECT. VI.,"of fair women.’ It is clear, on the face of the passage, that, whatever"
9533,SECT. VI.,"it may mean, the sense does not require it to mean more in this place"
9534,SECT. VI.,"than a particular district, forming part of the dominions of Peleus."
9535,SECT. VI.,
9536,SECT. VI.,"In (2), where Achilles says, there are many Achæan maids through Hellas"
9537,SECT. VI.,"and Phthia, any one of whom he can have for a wife."
9538,SECT. VI.,
9539,SECT. VI.,"In (5), where we are told that Bathycles, son of Chalcon, dwelt in"
9540,SECT. VI.,"Hellas, preeminent among the Myrmidons in prosperity and wealth."
9541,SECT. VI.,
9542,SECT. VI.,"And in (9), where the shade of Achilles asks whether his father Peleus"
9543,SECT. VI.,is still in the enjoyment of kingly power in the populous country of
9544,SECT. VI.,"the Myrmidons, or whether he is deprived and despised through the range"
9545,SECT. VI.,of Hellas and Phthia.
9546,SECT. VI.,
9547,SECT. VI.,"But among these four passages there is a distinction. In (1), (5), and"
9548,SECT. VI.,"(9) Hellas is combined with Phthia. Now we have seen, that there were"
9549,SECT. VI.,Phthians beyond the dominions of Peleus: if the territorial name Phthia
9550,SECT. VI.,"was similarly extended, then the presumption would arise that Hellas"
9551,SECT. VI.,also might mean something more than lay within those dominions. But
9552,SECT. VI.,there are many passages where Phthia is used without Hellas; and in
9553,SECT. VI.,them all it is used to express the district where Peleus reigned. It
9554,SECT. VI.,"is not unlikely therefore, at first sight, that Hellas has the limited"
9555,SECT. VI.,sense of a part of the kingdom in these passages. And in the passage
9556,SECT. VI.,"relating to Bathycles, the son of Chalcon, the limited sense is yet"
9557,SECT. VI.,"more strongly suggested; yet, as we may hereafter see more clearly, it"
9558,SECT. VI.,is by no means positively required either in that or in any of these
9559,SECT. VI.,four places.
9560,SECT. VI.,
9561,SECT. VI.,"And it is abundantly clear, from the remainder of the passages, that"
9562,SECT. VI.,"the name Hellas had already, in Homer’s time, begun to bear a more"
9563,SECT. VI.,extended sense.
9564,SECT. VI.,
9565,SECT. VI.,"In proof of this, let us take, firstly, the two passages in which it"
9566,SECT. VI.,"stands alone. In Il. ix. 444-8, Phœnix tells us that nothing would"
9567,SECT. VI.,"induce him to quit Achilles; no, not even if the gods, brushing off"
9568,SECT. VI.,"his old age, were to make him young and vigorous again, such as he was"
9569,SECT. VI.,"when first he left Hellas, the land of fair women, flying from his"
9570,SECT. VI.,feud with his father Amyntor. Now this passage absolutely proves that
9571,SECT. VI.,"the word Hellas was used by Homer, at least occasionally, for some"
9572,SECT. VI.,"limited district, and not (as in after times) for the entire country;"
9573,SECT. VI.,inasmuch as Phœnix could not otherwise have said he _left_ Hellas on
9574,SECT. VI.,"this occasion. But on the other hand it demonstrates, that the limits"
9575,SECT. VI.,"of Hellas were not so narrow, as the passages heretofore considered"
9576,SECT. VI.,might permit us to suppose. For Phœnix goes on to describe the cause
9577,SECT. VI.,of quarrel; and (478-80) says he took his course _through_ broad
9578,SECT. VI.,"open Hellas, and came _into_ fertile Phthia, to Peleus the king. The"
9579,SECT. VI.,"supposition most consistent with the wording of these passages is, that"
9580,SECT. VI.,"Phthia comprised the principal district of the dominions of Peleus,"
9581,SECT. VI.,while a portion of them may have fallen (as we elsewhere see was
9582,SECT. VI.,perhaps the case) under the name of Hellas: but they absolutely place
9583,SECT. VI.,"the abode of Amyntor outside the realm of Peleus; and therefore, in"
9584,SECT. VI.,"saying that Phœnix left Hellas, and that he fled from his home through"
9585,SECT. VI.,"Hellas, they imply necessarily that Hellas, the region from which he"
9586,SECT. VI.,"fled, was, in part at least, outside of that realm to which he fled."
9587,SECT. VI.,
9588,SECT. VI.,"But these passages will harmonise perfectly with each other, and with"
9589,SECT. VI.,"those formerly examined, if we suppose that Hellas meant the whole of"
9590,SECT. VI.,"Northern Greece generally, but that a particular portion of it had been"
9591,SECT. VI.,"more definitely stamped with the name of Phthia, as the chief seat of"
9592,SECT. VI.,Peleus and the Myrmidons. For then the original abode of Phœnix might
9593,SECT. VI.,"be in Hellas, as he says (in ix. 447) that it was: and yet he would"
9594,SECT. VI.,"pursue his way through Hellas, as he says (ibid. 478) that he did: and"
9595,SECT. VI.,"he would also leave Hellas, namely by coming into Phthia: and moreover"
9596,SECT. VI.,the dominions of Peleus might go beyond what was commonly known by the
9597,SECT. VI.,"particular designation of Phthia, and might include some portion of"
9598,SECT. VI.,"Hellas, as, from Il. ii. 683, they evidently did."
9599,SECT. VI.,
9600,SECT. VI.,"This supposition is recommended to us, not only by its conforming to"
9601,SECT. VI.,"all the requisite conditions, and furnishing a convenient construction"
9602,SECT. VI.,"for all the passages we have examined, but by the fact that Phthia, and"
9603,SECT. VI.,"Phthia alone, is commonly mentioned in the poem as the home of Achilles"
9604,SECT. VI.,and the Myrmidons: which shows that they had a more special relation to
9605,SECT. VI.,"the territory known by that name, than to Hellas."
9606,SECT. VI.,
9607,SECT. VI.,"If any thing be still wanting, the proof is brought to completeness by"
9608,SECT. VI.,"two other passages: the one (Il. x. 261-7), which tells us that this"
9609,SECT. VI.,"Amyntor, son of Ormenus, dwelt in Eleon; dwelt there permanently, since"
9610,SECT. VI.,"Autolycus stole from him an helmet, by breaking into his substantial"
9611,SECT. VI.,"well-built house,"
9612,SECT. VI.,
9613,SECT. VI.,πύκινον δόμον ἀντιτορήσας[498]:
9614,SECT. VI.,
9615,SECT. VI.,"and the other the verse of the Catalogue[499], which places Eleon in"
9616,SECT. VI.,Bœotia. These passages therefore clearly appear to carry the name
9617,SECT. VI.,"Hellas as far as Bœotia, and to make it reach continuously from thence"
9618,SECT. VI.,"to Phthia. And if Hellas comes down to Bœotia, then it includes"
9619,SECT. VI.,Locris; and the various tribes of these regions may be included in
9620,SECT. VI.,"the general name of Hellenes, though to all appearance they were not"
9621,SECT. VI.,"as yet familiarly and ordinarily so called. And if Locris and Bœotia,"
9622,SECT. VI.,"with part of Southern Thessaly (the dominions of Peleus), are included"
9623,SECT. VI.,"within the range of the name Hellas, we can have no difficulty in"
9624,SECT. VI.,"supposing that it included Northern Thessaly also, which must have been"
9625,SECT. VI.,the pathway of the Helli to the South.
9626,SECT. VI.,
9627,SECT. VI.,"But we find Ἕλλας in another combination besides that with Phthia,"
9628,SECT. VI.,"in the four passages of the Odyssey, (one of them being a simple"
9629,SECT. VI.,"repetition of another,) which we have still to examine."
9630,SECT. VI.,
9631,SECT. VI.,"Now the line Od. iv. 726, repeated 816, is under suspicion, of which it"
9632,SECT. VI.,is not worth while to scrutinise the justice: as the idea and force of
9633,SECT. VI.,"it is just the same with that of Od. i. 344,"
9634,SECT. VI.,
9635,SECT. VI.,"Ἀνδρὸς, τοῦ κλέος εὐρὺ καθ’ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος."
9636,SECT. VI.,
9637,SECT. VI.,This passage describes the fame of Ulysses as spread through the
9638,SECT. VI.,"breadth of Hellas and mid-Argos; (or, from the heart of Argos to its"
9639,SECT. VI.,"extremities, right through or _all over_ Argos.) And again in Od."
9640,SECT. VI.,"xv. 80, when Telemachus has proposed to return home forthwith from"
9641,SECT. VI.,"the court of Menelaus, his host gently dissuades him from haste, and"
9642,SECT. VI.,"counsels a more extended tour, καθ’ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος; offering"
9643,SECT. VI.,"to take charge of his horses, and to shew him ‘the cities,’ or secured"
9644,SECT. VI.,"dwellings, ‘of men.’"
9645,SECT. VI.,
9646,SECT. VI.,The signification of the word Ἄργος will be considered hereafter: for
9647,SECT. VI.,"the present purpose it is enough to observe that the word μέσον, as"
9648,SECT. VI.,"used by Menelaus, in combination with Hellas, of itself prevents our"
9649,SECT. VI.,applying it simply to the narrow corner of the Peloponnesus in which
9650,SECT. VI.,the city of Argos was placed; and therefore that it can scarcely mean
9651,SECT. VI.,"less than Peloponnesus. And it is not less plain, that whatever may"
9652,SECT. VI.,"be the force of the words when taken singly, their effect when taken"
9653,SECT. VI.,together can hardly be less than this: Menelaus must mean to point to
9654,SECT. VI.,"Greece at large, as the scene of the proposed excursion. For there is"
9655,SECT. VI.,"no assignable portion of Greece to which, consistently with the words"
9656,SECT. VI.,"and the sense, he can be held to confine his meaning. If we could"
9657,SECT. VI.,suppose him to mean Peloponnesus only by the two names Hellas and
9658,SECT. VI.,"Argos, which he employs in this place, we should but enlarge thereby"
9659,SECT. VI.,the Homeric capacity of the word Hellas; for we have already brought it
9660,SECT. VI.,"down from the north to Bœotia; and we should, in the way now proposed,"
9661,SECT. VI.,"carry it through the isthmus, and over Peloponnesus, or, at the least,"
9662,SECT. VI.,"over some part of it. But even if Menelaus means Peloponnesus only,"
9663,SECT. VI.,"which is most improbable, it is plainly incredible that such should be"
9664,SECT. VI.,"the meaning of Penelope in Od. i. 344. As a Greek, she _cannot_ mean to"
9665,SECT. VI.,limit the renown of her husband to any sphere less wide than Greece.
9666,SECT. VI.,
9667,SECT. VI.,"We have already seen, that Hellas sometimes includes certainly the"
9668,SECT. VI.,"territory from Southern Thessaly to Bœotia, and probably Thessaly at"
9669,SECT. VI.,"large: and it is quite plain that, if it comes to Bœotia, it does not"
9670,SECT. VI.,"stop there, but applies to the whole of Middle Greece, the region"
9671,SECT. VI.,between Thessaly and the isthmus: for the application of the term
9672,SECT. VI.,Hellas could not stop except at some great natural division of the
9673,SECT. VI.,"country, and the isthmus is here the only one possible."
9674,SECT. VI.,
9675,SECT. VI.,"Now the name Argos is related to Thessaly[500], but much more specially"
9676,SECT. VI.,"related to the Peloponnesus, as we shall see from a number of passages."
9677,SECT. VI.,It has no relation at all in Homer to that division of the country in
9678,SECT. VI.,particular which we call Middle Greece.
9679,SECT. VI.,
9680,SECT. VI.,"Assuming it, then, to mean Peloponnesus, in that case Hellas means"
9681,SECT. VI.,"Middle with Northern Greece: and the two names of Hellas and Argos,"
9682,SECT. VI.,"taken together, completely and conveniently express the whole country."
9683,SECT. VI.,The only alterations are such as would assign to Hellas a larger sense;
9684,SECT. VI.,"in no case can it, as to this passage, admit of a more restricted one."
9685,SECT. VI.,
9686,SECT. VI.,"The foregoing argument is supported to a certain extent by the fact,"
9687,SECT. VI.,that while territorial names are frequent for the Peloponnesian part of
9688,SECT. VI.,"Greece, (we have Achaic Argos, Iasian Argos, Elis, Arcadia, Lacedæmon,)"
9689,SECT. VI.,the continent to the north of the isthmus is generally without
9690,SECT. VI.,"territorial names: Phthia and Pelasgic Argos are, I think, the only"
9691,SECT. VI.,"exceptions. There is thus before us a gap, which the name Hellas, as it"
9692,SECT. VI.,"has been here construed, seems conveniently to fill."
9693,SECT. VI.,
9694,SECT. VI.,"This construction of certain passages, in which the word Hellas is"
9695,SECT. VI.,"contained, is not one which should be adopted by the reader unawares."
9696,SECT. VI.,"But if, like myself, after examining into it strictly he assents to"
9697,SECT. VI.,"its justice and necessity, then he will find that it is of the utmost"
9698,SECT. VI.,importance to the elucidation of Homeric history; for it supplies a key
9699,SECT. VI.,to other much contested uses of the Hellenic name.
9700,SECT. VI.,
9701,SECT. VI.,"In the first place, I submit that if we now review the ten passages"
9702,SECT. VI.,"in which Homer speaks of Hellas, and bear in mind that in some among"
9703,SECT. VI.,"them it cannot be construed as meaning less than, with a certain amount"
9704,SECT. VI.,"of indeterminateness as to boundaries, Northern and Middle Greece"
9705,SECT. VI.,"generally, we shall also find, that there is not one of all those"
9706,SECT. VI.,"passages, in which it will not at least admit of the same sense. I"
9707,SECT. VI.,"do not deny that it is open to us to hold that the Hellas, in which"
9708,SECT. VI.,"Chalcon dwelt, was a mere district of Thessaly, and that Homer attaches"
9709,SECT. VI.,in different places different senses to the word. But if there is a
9710,SECT. VI.,"sense, substantially one, which will suit the word in every place"
9711,SECT. VI.,"where it is used, it seems most reasonable to adhere generally to"
9712,SECT. VI.,"that sense. Such a meaning we have, I think, found for Hellas, in"
9713,SECT. VI.,concluding that it is used to signify Northern and Middle Greece. In
9714,SECT. VI.,"this sense it overrides and includes Phthia, as France overrides Alsace"
9715,SECT. VI.,"or Burgundy. But as there was a time when Alsace and Burgundy might,"
9716,SECT. VI.,"before the present state of incorporation, have been either said to be"
9717,SECT. VI.,"in France or not in France, without an outrageous license of speech"
9718,SECT. VI.,"either way, so perhaps the land of Phthia was for Homer either a part"
9719,SECT. VI.,"of Hellas, or a province carved out of Hellas by the special occupation"
9720,SECT. VI.,"of the Myrmidons, as occasion might chance to demand. Not that he"
9721,SECT. VI.,"did not conform to the facts, but that the facts were themselves"
9722,SECT. VI.,"indeterminate. To our habits, under which every inch of ground belongs"
9723,SECT. VI.,"to somebody, this indefiniteness is wholly strange; but in times"
9724,SECT. VI.,"when only spots here and there were appropriated, and there was no"
9725,SECT. VI.,"universal occupation, it was thoroughly natural, and the thing really"
9726,SECT. VI.,"strange would be the absence of it. Accordingly, when Phœnix says he"
9727,SECT. VI.,"left Hellas, he gives to Phthia, the name of the place he reached,"
9728,SECT. VI.,its exclusive force. When he says Chalcon dwelt in Hellas among the
9729,SECT. VI.,"Myrmidons, he probably means in Phthia, but now regards Phthia as"
9730,SECT. VI.,covered by the larger designation. When Homer tells us the soldiers
9731,SECT. VI.,"of Achilles were those who inhabited Alos, and Alope, and Trachin,"
9732,SECT. VI.,"and who occupied Phthia and Hellas, we understand by the three first,"
9733,SECT. VI.,"particular spots which the Myrmidons had settled, by Phthia a larger"
9734,SECT. VI.,district which they had so far dotted with their occupancy as to make
9735,SECT. VI.,"it peculiarly theirs, and by Hellas the surrounding country, into which"
9736,SECT. VI.,they had more or less ramified.
9737,SECT. VI.,
9738,SECT. VI.,Assuming then the sense of the word Hellas to be now sufficiently
9739,SECT. VI.,"ascertained, the next question is, how came this country, which has"
9740,SECT. VI.,"been described, to bear the name of Hellas? And the question admits of"
9741,SECT. VI.,but one answer. It could only be called Hellas because tribes of Helli
9742,SECT. VI.,"had become its masters, its governing race, the depositaries, through"
9743,SECT. VI.,"its various regions, of political and military power."
9744,SECT. VI.,
9745,SECT. VI.,"We must therefore understand that, according to Homer, tribes reputed"
9746,SECT. VI.,"to be of Hellic origin were so far distributed over this country, as to"
9747,SECT. VI.,have begun at least to affix their name to it: though without having
9748,SECT. VI.,"absolutely effaced every older name, like Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος and though"
9749,SECT. VI.,"not precluding the introduction of names perhaps more recent, certainly"
9750,SECT. VI.,"more specific, such as Phthia."
9751,SECT. VI.,
9752,SECT. VI.,_The Hellenes of Homer._
9753,SECT. VI.,
9754,SECT. VI.,"We may now proceed to consider the force, according to Homer’s use, of"
9755,SECT. VI.,"the names derived from Hellas. These are, as commonly understood,"
9756,SECT. VI.,
9757,SECT. VI.,"1. Ἕλληνες,"
9758,SECT. VI.,
9759,SECT. VI.,"2. Πανέλληνες,"
9760,SECT. VI.,
9761,SECT. VI.,"and to these I shall presume to add,"
9762,SECT. VI.,
9763,SECT. VI.,3. Κεφάλληνες.
9764,SECT. VI.,
9765,SECT. VI.,"The first of these is found only in Il. ii. 684. Here, after the"
9766,SECT. VI.,"description of the places from which the forces of Achilles came, the"
9767,SECT. VI.,poet proceeds to give them their designation:
9768,SECT. VI.,
9769,SECT. VI.,Μυρμίδονες δὲ καλεῦντο καὶ Ἕλληνες καὶ Ἀχαιοί.
9770,SECT. VI.,
9771,SECT. VI.,We find an exclusive use[501] of the word Myrmidons for the force
9772,SECT. VI.,"of Achilles throughout the Iliad, except in this one place;"
9773,SECT. VI.,"notwithstanding that Phœnix, who was lord of the Dolopes, commanded one"
9774,SECT. VI.,"of the five divisions[502], and that we may therefore presume a certain"
9775,SECT. VI.,"part of the force to have been Dolopian. From this exclusive use, we"
9776,SECT. VI.,cannot doubt that the name of Myrmidons was that which appertained to
9777,SECT. VI.,"them in particular, as the ruling tribe among the subjects of Peleus."
9778,SECT. VI.,
9779,SECT. VI.,Had we found reason to construe the word Ἕλλας in the preceding line as
9780,SECT. VI.,"meaning only a district of his dominions, it would have followed, that"
9781,SECT. VI.,Ἕλληνες meant the inhabitants of that district; and that a part of the
9782,SECT. VI.,"soldiers of Achilles were Hellenes rather than Myrmidons, in virtue of"
9783,SECT. VI.,a local name. But it follows from what we have already concluded about
9784,SECT. VI.,"Hellas, that the name of Hellenes was applicable to all the Myrmidons"
9785,SECT. VI.,"as being themselves inhabitants of Hellas, that is, of Phthia, which"
9786,SECT. VI.,belonged to Hellas.
9787,SECT. VI.,
9788,SECT. VI.,"And in passing it should be noticed that, although the Myrmidons"
9789,SECT. VI.,"inhabited Phthia, they are never called Phthians; nor do we ever hear"
9790,SECT. VI.,"of Phthians at all in Homer, except only in that passage where they"
9791,SECT. VI.,are described as engaged with Locrians and others in repelling the
9792,SECT. VI.,Trojan assault[503]. They are there described as under the command of
9793,SECT. VI.,"Medon and Podarces. But in the Catalogue Podarces and Medon[504], as"
9794,SECT. VI.,"substitutes for Protesilaus and Philoctetes respectively, command the"
9795,SECT. VI.,"second and fourth Thessalian contingents, which came from districts"
9796,SECT. VI.,lying near the kingdom of Peleus. Either therefore the Phthian name
9797,SECT. VI.,"extended beyond the limits of Phthia, or the Phthians were those"
9798,SECT. VI.,"whom the Myrmidons had recently driven out, and whose lands they had"
9799,SECT. VI.,occupied.
9800,SECT. VI.,
9801,SECT. VI.,We cannot conclusively settle the sense of the word Ἀχαιοὶ in this
9802,SECT. VI.,"passage, except by anticipating the results of an examination, on which"
9803,SECT. VI.,"we have not yet entered. But it may be observed even at this point,"
9804,SECT. VI.,that the bearings of the passage are somewhat adverse to a merely
9805,SECT. VI.,"local construction for it. If Myrmidon was the strictly proper name,"
9806,SECT. VI.,then Achæan must have been a designation which was not proper to the
9807,SECT. VI.,"Myrmidons only, but which they enjoyed in common with others. And yet,"
9808,SECT. VI.,"on the other hand, not in common with all the Greeks, but in some"
9809,SECT. VI.,"sense more restricted than that, in which it is habitually applied to"
9810,SECT. VI.,the whole army. For in that large and general sense every contingent
9811,SECT. VI.,"of the army was Achæan, and Homer would certainly therefore not have"
9812,SECT. VI.,mentioned the Achæan name with respect to one in particular. It can
9813,SECT. VI.,"hardly escape observation that, studying great clearness and precision"
9814,SECT. VI.,"in the Catalogue, he systematically avoids the introduction of his"
9815,SECT. VI.,general names for the army. We never read of Danaans or Argeians in
9816,SECT. VI.,"it at all, and of Achæans only twice[505]. So far then as the passage"
9817,SECT. VI.,"itself guides us, it points to the supposition that those who were"
9818,SECT. VI.,"called Myrmidons properly, to distinguish them from all others, and"
9819,SECT. VI.,Hellenes because they were (in common with others) inhabitants of
9820,SECT. VI.,"Hellas, belonged likewise to a particular class or race of Greeks, to"
9821,SECT. VI.,whom the name of Ἀχαιοὶ was applicable in some distinctive sense. The
9822,SECT. VI.,"three appellations, accordingly, are not so many synonyms; but each has"
9823,SECT. VI.,probably its own proper scope.
9824,SECT. VI.,
9825,SECT. VI.,"Thucydides[506] speaks with his usual accuracy, when he says that Homer"
9826,SECT. VI.,has given the name of Hellenes to no portion of the army except the
9827,SECT. VI.,troops of Achilles from Phthiotis. He does not however go beyond the
9828,SECT. VI.,assertion that this word had not yet grown into an appellation for the
9829,SECT. VI.,"Greeks universally, an assertion which, as far as Homer’s evidence"
9830,SECT. VI.,"goes, is undeniable. But it does not require us also to deny that the"
9831,SECT. VI.,"Hellas of Homer extends beyond Phthia, and that the name of Hellenes"
9832,SECT. VI.,may even then have been beginning to attach to the inhabitants of other
9833,SECT. VI.,"parts of Hellas, though perhaps less fixedly, as yet, than to the"
9834,SECT. VI.,Myrmidons.
9835,SECT. VI.,
9836,SECT. VI.,_The Panhellenes of Homer._
9837,SECT. VI.,
9838,SECT. VI.,"With these facts in view, I am wholly unable to follow those who have"
9839,SECT. VI.,"condemned, upon internal evidence, that verse of the Catalogue in which"
9840,SECT. VI.,we find mention of the Panhellenes.
9841,SECT. VI.,
9842,SECT. VI.,"Speaking of Oilean Ajax, commander of the Locrians, the poet says (Il."
9843,SECT. VI.,"ii. 530),"
9844,SECT. VI.,
9845,SECT. VI.,ἐγχείῃ δ’ ἐκέκαστο Πανέλληνας καὶ Ἀχαιούς.
9846,SECT. VI.,
9847,SECT. VI.,It is not grammatically necessary that we should make these two words
9848,SECT. VI.,"coextensive; and I do not believe that either of them separately,"
9849,SECT. VI.,"as here used, conveys the whole force of the two, though perhaps"
9850,SECT. VI.,conjointly they may carry the assertion that he was the best spearman
9851,SECT. VI.,in the army.
9852,SECT. VI.,
9853,SECT. VI.,"If there was a Hellas in the time of Homer, which was inhabited by a"
9854,SECT. VI.,"variety of tribes, then, as these tribes dispersedly might be called"
9855,SECT. VI.,"with propriety Hellenes, even apart from the authority of constant"
9856,SECT. VI.,"use, so they might with equal propriety be combined into the term"
9857,SECT. VI.,"Panhellenes, which would mean all the tribes, including the Locrians,"
9858,SECT. VI.,"that inhabited Hellas, or Northern and Mid-Greece. Thus, as the"
9859,SECT. VI.,Achæan name was at this time more prominent and distinguished in the
9860,SECT. VI.,"Peloponnesus[507] than in any other part of the country, the poet may"
9861,SECT. VI.,in this place by Ἀχαιοὶ mean the Southern or Peloponnesian Greece; so
9862,SECT. VI.,"as, by the two epithets conjointly, to signify the whole army. Or he"
9863,SECT. VI.,"may mean all those who, in Hellas or beyond it, were of the pure Achæan"
9864,SECT. VI.,"race (assuming, for the moment, that such a race existed); and thus may"
9865,SECT. VI.,"here assert, that Ajax excelled all Hellas, and even all Achæans in or"
9866,SECT. VI.,"out of Hellas, using the last of the two words by way of climax. I do"
9867,SECT. VI.,not deny that he may also be construed to mean the whole host in the
9868,SECT. VI.,"gross by Ἀχαιοὶ, agreeably to the common use of it; but this is less"
9869,SECT. VI.,"likely; as the name, so understood, would not be distinctive."
9870,SECT. VI.,
9871,SECT. VI.,Nor do I see any reason to hesitate about treating the Homeric name
9872,SECT. VI.,Κεφάλληνες as one of his Hellenic group of names. As in the case of
9873,SECT. VI.,"Πελασγοὶ, so here we have a name formed by a combination of different"
9874,SECT. VI.,words. The word _head_ seems to have been represented by a root of
9875,SECT. VI.,"flexible structure. In Sanscrit it is _kapâla_[508], in Greek κεφάλη,"
9876,SECT. VI.,"in Latin _caput_: but it also appears in the German _kopf_, and in the"
9877,SECT. VI.,"Greek κόπτειν, ‘to butt,’ and in κύβη, κυβιστάω, κυβερνάω. The word"
9878,SECT. VI.,"Κεφάλληνες seems, then, to be formed in the most direct manner from the"
9879,SECT. VI.,"root κεφ, signifying ‘head,’ and Ἕλληνες: and thus it both attaches"
9880,SECT. VI.,"Ulysses, with at least the dominant race among his subjects, to the"
9881,SECT. VI.,"Hellic stock, and indicates the tendency of the Hellenic name, even in"
9882,SECT. VI.,"Homer’s time, to reproduce itself and to spread abroad."
9883,SECT. VI.,
9884,SECT. VI.,"Again, we observe in his rare use of Κεφάλληνες the same signs as in"
9885,SECT. VI.,"Ἕλληνες and Πανέλληνες, that the power of the name was only growing up"
9886,SECT. VI.,"from its infancy. For the word is used but twice in the Iliad, and no"
9887,SECT. VI.,"more than four times in the Odyssey, where there is constant occasion"
9888,SECT. VI.,"for addressing, or for speaking of, the subjects of Ulysses. We find in"
9889,SECT. VI.,"that poem Ἰθακήσιοι eleven times, and Ἀχαιοὶ constantly."
9890,SECT. VI.,
9891,SECT. VI.,"Having dealt with the Homeric derivations of Hellas[509], let us now"
9892,SECT. VI.,"ascend to the word, from which it is itself derived; Hellas being"
9893,SECT. VI.,"evidently, in the Greek tongue, the country which had been occupied by"
9894,SECT. VI.,the Helli.
9895,SECT. VI.,
9896,SECT. VI.,"Of the people who are so termed, either under the form beginning with"
9897,SECT. VI.,"the aspirate, or else under that of Σελλοὶ, we find obvious Homeric"
9898,SECT. VI.,"vestiges in the Hellespont, Ἑλλήσποντος; in various rivers termed"
9899,SECT. VI.,"Σελληείς; and in the invocation of Achilles to Jupiter, which places"
9900,SECT. VI.,"the Selli in the north of Thessaly, about wintry Dodona, and seems to"
9901,SECT. VI.,stamp them as then still remaining a people of the rudest habits in
9902,SECT. VI.,their mountain home[510];
9903,SECT. VI.,
9904,SECT. VI.,Δωδώνης μεδέων δυσχειμέρου· ἀμφὶ δὲ Σελλοὶ
9905,SECT. VI.,"σοὶ ναίουσ’ ὑποφῆται ἀνιπτόποδες, χαμαιεῦναι."
9906,SECT. VI.,
9907,SECT. VI.,_The Σελλοὶ of Homer._
9908,SECT. VI.,
9909,SECT. VI.,The word Ἕλλοι would appear to be not the most probable reading of
9910,SECT. VI.,the text of this invocation; for it presumes an inconvenient loading
9911,SECT. VI.,of the sentence with the double pronoun σε and σοι. But there can be
9912,SECT. VI.,no doubt whatever as to its identity with Σελλοί. Independently of
9913,SECT. VI.,"philological argument, there is the strongest presumption that in this"
9914,SECT. VI.,"place Achilles intends to name his own national ancestry, as being the"
9915,SECT. VI.,"ministers of the god; who give him, as it were, the right to invoke"
9916,SECT. VI.,"the aid of the Pelasgic indeed, but therefore genuine and original,"
9917,SECT. VI.,Jupiter of Dodona. But no circumstance seems to be better established
9918,SECT. VI.,"by philological research, than that in many cases of Greek words,"
9919,SECT. VI.,"which now begin with the aspirate, there was one (or more than one)"
9920,SECT. VI.,"initial letter, and that frequently that letter was the _sigma_. Much"
9921,SECT. VI.,"obscurity has hung about this subject, from the fact that discovery has"
9922,SECT. VI.,"proceeded piecemeal, and that for a length of time the word _digamma_"
9923,SECT. VI.,was used to signify what had originally filled the void now existing
9924,SECT. VI.,in so many places of the Homeric versification. What this _digamma_
9925,SECT. VI.,"might have been was disputed; but it was, almost insensibly perhaps,"
9926,SECT. VI.,assumed to be some one letter or sound only. But as inquiry has made
9927,SECT. VI.,"further advances, many forms of a lost letter or letters have been"
9928,SECT. VI.,discovered: and it has also been made clear that the gaps ought to be
9929,SECT. VI.,"filled up variously, and not by any one uniform expedient. To take"
9930,SECT. VI.,"very simple examples, there can be no doubt about the identity of"
9931,SECT. VI.,"ἓξ, ἕπτα, ὓς, with _sex_, _septem_, _sus_: nor any doubt about the"
9932,SECT. VI.,"essential identity of ὕδωρ and _sudor_, ἡδὺς and _suavis_, ἑκυρὸς and"
9933,SECT. VI.,"_socer_: none therefore that the σ ought to be supplied, and not _f_,"
9934,SECT. VI.,"_w_, or _v_, in the passage φίλε ἑκυρέ[511]. While indeed a presumption"
9935,SECT. VI.,"arises[512] from the German words _schwieger_ and _schwäger_, that a"
9936,SECT. VI.,"double or even treble loss may have occurred, and that the passage may"
9937,SECT. VI.,"have run φίλε σϝεκυρέ. Under these circumstances, in the case before"
9938,SECT. VI.,"us, where we have both forms represented, there can be no hesitation as"
9939,SECT. VI.,"to the identity of Ἑλλοὶ and Σελλοί: the first represented in Ἕλλας,"
9940,SECT. VI.,"Ἕλληνες, Ἑλλήσποντος, and the Ἑλλοπία of Hesiod: the other and older"
9941,SECT. VI.,one supported by Σελληείς.
9942,SECT. VI.,
9943,SECT. VI.,"There is another curious and instructive case, in which we have"
9944,SECT. VI.,the older form of the word Σελλοὶ still remaining: besides that of
9945,SECT. VI.,"Προσέληνοι, to which allusion has already been made in considering"
9946,SECT. VI.,"the case of the Pelasgian Arcadians. In the Birds of Aristophanes,"
9947,SECT. VI.,"the dramatist satirizes Athens and the Sicilian Expedition, under the"
9948,SECT. VI.,"name of a city in the clouds, called Νεφελοκοκκυγία; the object being"
9949,SECT. VI.,"to expose the arrogance of great pretensions, without adequate means"
9950,SECT. VI.,"to support them. There, he says, lie most of the goods of Theagenes,"
9951,SECT. VI.,"and all those of Æschines. This Theagenes was called κάπνος, smoke,"
9952,SECT. VI.,"because he promised much, and did nothing. Æschines was a pauper,"
9953,SECT. VI.,"who pretended to wealth. The Scholiast adds, ἦν δὲ Αἰσχίνης Σελλοῦ."
9954,SECT. VI.,"Ἔλεγον δὲ ἐκ μεταφορᾶς τοιούτους Σελλούς· καὶ τὸ ἀλαζονεύεσθαι δὲ,"
9955,SECT. VI.,"σελλίζειν[513]. Cary thinks the term σελλίζειν came from a Sellus, the"
9956,SECT. VI.,"father of this Æschines. But in the first place, it seems difficult"
9957,SECT. VI.,"to rely on the Scholiast for knowing, still less for recording with"
9958,SECT. VI.,"accuracy, the name of the father of an obscure person, who had lived"
9959,SECT. VI.,"in the age of Aristophanes. In the second place, if Æschines was an"
9960,SECT. VI.,"obscure fellow, it is most improbable that his father’s name should"
9961,SECT. VI.,have become the root of a Greek word descriptive of a particular
9962,SECT. VI.,habit or propensity. Such words (for example) as hectoring and
9963,SECT. VI.,rhodomontading presuppose a great celebrity in the person on whose
9964,SECT. VI.,"name they are based. Lastly, the derivation from the ancient Σελλοὶ"
9965,SECT. VI.,"seems a perfectly natural one, and also adequate to the case. It is"
9966,SECT. VI.,in some degree characteristic of those who in reduced circumstances
9967,SECT. VI.,"trace back their lineage to a very ancient stock, instead of relying"
9968,SECT. VI.,"simply on the substantial honour of their descent, still to affect the"
9969,SECT. VI.,possession of the wealth which has passed away from them: to play for
9970,SECT. VI.,"themselves the part, which Caleb Balderstone desires to play, on behalf"
9971,SECT. VI.,"not of himself, but of the Master of Ravenswood, in Scott’s ‘Bride"
9972,SECT. VI.,"of Lammermoor’; and altogether to be sensitive, or what is called"
9973,SECT. VI.,"touchy on the subject, and to lean on the whole towards a certain"
9974,SECT. VI.,"boastfulness, in common with the νεοπλοῦτοι at the other extremity of"
9975,SECT. VI.,the scale. There is a broad distinction between treating the Scholiast
9976,SECT. VI.,"as a witness to the existence and force of a current phrase, and the"
9977,SECT. VI.,"taking his word for the parentage of a nobody, like this Æschines,"
9978,SECT. VI.,"who had lived long before him. It may, however, not be necessary to"
9979,SECT. VI.,"construe σελλίζειν solely, or even specially, with reference to a pride"
9980,SECT. VI.,in wealth which had passed away. If we shall hereafter show for the
9981,SECT. VI.,"Selli[514] a Persian ancestry, then, even without any regard to change"
9982,SECT. VI.,"of circumstances, the phrase at once leads us back to the description"
9983,SECT. VI.,"given by Herodotus of the Persians their forefathers. Πέρσαι, φύσιν"
9984,SECT. VI.,"ἐόντες ὑβρισταὶ, εἰσὶν ἀχρήματοι[515]."
9985,SECT. VI.,
9986,SECT. VI.,I shall also have occasion to notice hereafter one or two other words

10058,SECT. VII.,"In this attempt at an ethnological survey, we have now come down to the"
10059,SECT. VII.,"point, at which the Greek Peninsula passes over from its old Pelasgian"
10060,SECT. VII.,"character, and becomes subject to predominating Hellenic influences."
10061,SECT. VII.,
10062,SECT. VII.,"Now therefore, and before we examine the relations and succession of"
10063,SECT. VII.,"the great Homeric appellations for the Hellenes, appears to be the"
10064,SECT. VII.,time for considering how the account stands between these tribes and
10065,SECT. VII.,"the Pelasgians, and what were, so far as by probable evidence we can"
10066,SECT. VII.,"ascertain it, the respective contributions from the two sources to the"
10067,SECT. VII.,integral character of the Greeks and of their institutions.
10068,SECT. VII.,
10069,SECT. VII.,"In the case of Greece, as it is known to us in history, we have the"
10070,SECT. VII.,"most remarkable disproportion between moral and physical power, and"
10071,SECT. VII.,"between the green and the full grown product, which is offered to"
10072,SECT. VII.,"view in the whole range of human experience. A circumscribed country,"
10073,SECT. VII.,"with a small population, throws forth, without loss of vital power,"
10074,SECT. VII.,"to the East and to the West, colonies greatly transcending itself, as"
10075,SECT. VII.,"would appear, in wealth and population; continues for many centuries"
10076,SECT. VII.,to exercise a primary influence in the world; at one time resists and
10077,SECT. VII.,"repels, at another invades and terrifies, at a third overthrows and"
10078,SECT. VII.,"crushes to atoms the great colossus of Eastern empire, and continues"
10079,SECT. VII.,"to exercise, through the medium of mind, a singular mastery, enduring"
10080,SECT. VII.,"down to our own time, and likely still to endure, over civilized man."
10081,SECT. VII.,"And even the miniature organization of Greece presents to us, within"
10082,SECT. VII.,"its own limits, diversities of character almost enough for a quarter of"
10083,SECT. VII.,the globe.
10084,SECT. VII.,
10085,SECT. VII.,Many of these diversities connect themselves with the ethnological
10086,SECT. VII.,"formation of the different communities. In the course of that process,"
10087,SECT. VII.,"so far as can be discerned, certain admixtures of foreign influence"
10088,SECT. VII.,"were supplied direct from Phœnicia, Egypt, or elsewhere: but the grand"
10089,SECT. VII.,"component parts or factors in this composite product are two, the"
10090,SECT. VII.,"Hellenic and the Pelasgic. To this dual combination, perhaps the double"
10091,SECT. VII.,"invocation of Achilles (Il. xvi. 233, 4) is a witness."
10092,SECT. VII.,
10093,SECT. VII.,The development of the national character is the most large and varied
10094,SECT. VII.,"in Attica, where the population, from successive immigrations of"
10095,SECT. VII.,"bodies of refugees, and from the free general resort and reception of"
10096,SECT. VII.,"strangers, presented also the largest and most varied ethnical compound."
10097,SECT. VII.,
10098,SECT. VII.,In analysing that national character which thus resulted from the
10099,SECT. VII.,"amalgamation of ingredients chiefly Hellic and Pelasgic, we have now to"
10100,SECT. VII.,ask how far its different elements are referable to the Pelasgic or to
10101,SECT. VII.,the Hellic root respectively? We have traced in some degree the course
10102,SECT. VII.,and local circumscription of the races: can we affiliate upon them any
10103,SECT. VII.,of the contributions which they severally made to the varied manners
10104,SECT. VII.,and to the institutions of Greece?
10105,SECT. VII.,
10106,SECT. VII.,"The proof, as far as it is specific, can be only that which probable"
10107,SECT. VII.,and conjectural evidence afford: but that evidence is supported by the
10108,SECT. VII.,"fact, that it tends, as a whole, to an orderly result."
10109,SECT. VII.,
10110,SECT. VII.,"While they proceed from different sources, and present visible and"
10111,SECT. VII.,"even permanent distinctions of character, there is no violent disparity"
10112,SECT. VII.,between the Hellic and the Pelasgic races: they afford a good material
10113,SECT. VII.,"for coalescence. We are not to suppose that whatever the one had,"
10114,SECT. VII.,"the other had not. Of what belongs historically to the Pelasgi, much"
10115,SECT. VII.,may stand as theirs only through their priority of entrance into the
10116,SECT. VII.,country.
10117,SECT. VII.,
10118,SECT. VII.,"I propose to inquire what evidence can be drawn, either from"
10119,SECT. VII.,"philological sources, or from the text of Homer, to throw light on the"
10120,SECT. VII.,"several pursuits and tendencies of these races, under the heads of"
10121,SECT. VII.,"Religion, Policy, War, the Games, Poetry, the Chase, and Navigation."
10122,SECT. VII.,
10123,SECT. VII.,"Under some of these heads, however, we must in a measure anticipate"
10124,SECT. VII.,results which will be only obtained in full from later inquiries.
10125,SECT. VII.,
10126,SECT. VII.,The Poems afford us no complete and decisive test for discriminating
10127,SECT. VII.,between the Hellene and the Pelasgian contributions respectively to the
10128,SECT. VII.,Greek religion.
10129,SECT. VII.,
10130,SECT. VII.,"We shall, however, hereafter find many details of evidence bearing upon"
10131,SECT. VII.,this subject.
10132,SECT. VII.,
10133,SECT. VII.,"For the present I must confine myself to two very general propositions,"
10134,SECT. VII.,which are founded on the relations of the Greek religion with those of
10135,SECT. VII.,Troy and of Italy.
10136,SECT. VII.,
10137,SECT. VII.,"First, there seems to be a presumption, which may weigh with us to"
10138,SECT. VII.,"a certain extent in the absence of counter-evidence, that those"
10139,SECT. VII.,parts of the Greek religion which were common to the Greeks with the
10140,SECT. VII.,"Trojans were Pelasgian, and that those which were not common, were not"
10141,SECT. VII.,"Pelasgian. But of the parts which were common, and therefore Pelasgian,"
10142,SECT. VII.,many may have been originally Hellene too.
10143,SECT. VII.,
10144,SECT. VII.,"Again, a relationship subsists between Greece and Italy, as to the"
10145,SECT. VII.,"component parts of their respective populations, which, without being"
10146,SECT. VII.,"unduly strained, will throw considerable light upon the question of"
10147,SECT. VII.,Hellic and Pelasgic attributes.
10148,SECT. VII.,
10149,SECT. VII.,The Greek or the Italian of the classic times could not be expected
10150,SECT. VII.,"to own relationship with what lay to the northward, on each of those"
10151,SECT. VII.,"two peninsulas. The Roman, therefore, whose investigations led him"
10152,SECT. VII.,"to suppose there were Pelasgians in Italy, would only derive them"
10153,SECT. VII.,from Greece. For us the case stands far otherwise; and we must simply
10154,SECT. VII.,"consider the Pelasgians of Greece, and the Pelasgians of Italy, as two"
10155,SECT. VII.,"among a variety of branches, which struck out at different times from"
10156,SECT. VII.,"the main trunk of an extended race, probably diffusing itself over"
10157,SECT. VII.,many parts of Asia and Europe. In Greece and Italy respectively these
10158,SECT. VII.,"Pelasgic tribes entered into new combinations, probably not wholly"
10159,SECT. VII.,"different, nor, on the other hand, by any means in exact correspondence."
10160,SECT. VII.,
10161,SECT. VII.,We may perhaps be found not to go beyond the limits of the modesty
10162,SECT. VII.,"which the case requires, when we simply lay down this rule: that"
10163,SECT. VII.,correspondences in religion or in language between Greece and ancient
10164,SECT. VII.,"Italy raise a presumption, that those features of each country, in"
10165,SECT. VII.,"which the correspondence is observed, are of Pelasgic origin."
10166,SECT. VII.,
10167,SECT. VII.,Something of such correspondence we may perceive in regard to religion.
10168,SECT. VII.,"The religion of Homeric Greece differs from that of Rome, not only"
10169,SECT. VII.,"as to minor deities, but in the names given to many of the greater"
10170,SECT. VII.,"deities, and especially in the far more imaginative character of its"
10171,SECT. VII.,traditions.
10172,SECT. VII.,
10173,SECT. VII.,Those parts of the religion of Greece and Rome which were common to
10174,SECT. VII.,both were probably Pelasgian.
10175,SECT. VII.,
10176,SECT. VII.,"Let us take first the names which correspond, and then those which are"
10177,SECT. VII.,different.
10178,SECT. VII.,
10179,SECT. VII.,(I.) Names of deities that correspond in the Greek and Latin tongues:
10180,SECT. VII.,
10181,SECT. VII.,1. Ζεύς            Deus.
10182,SECT. VII.,2. Ζεὺς-πάτηρ      Jupiter.
10183,SECT. VII.,3. Ἀπόλλων         Apollo.
10184,SECT. VII.,4. Ἱστιή           Vesta.
10185,SECT. VII.,5. Λήτω            Latona.
10186,SECT. VII.,6. Περσεφόνη       Proserpina.
10187,SECT. VII.,7. Ἄρης            Mars or Mavors.
10188,SECT. VII.,
10189,SECT. VII.,(II.) Names of deities which do not in any manner correspond in the
10190,SECT. VII.,Greek and Latin tongues:
10191,SECT. VII.,
10192,SECT. VII.,1. Ἥρη         Juno.
10193,SECT. VII.,2. Ποσειδὼν    Neptune.
10194,SECT. VII.,3. Ἀιδώνευς    Pluto.
10195,SECT. VII.,4. Ἀθήνη       Minerva.
10196,SECT. VII.,5. Ἥφαιστος    Vulcan.
10197,SECT. VII.,6. Ἑρμῆς       Mercury.
10198,SECT. VII.,7. Ἀφροδίτη    Venus.
10199,SECT. VII.,8. Ἄρτεμις     Diana.
10200,SECT. VII.,9. Δημήτηρ     Ceres.
10201,SECT. VII.,10. Διόνυσος   Bacchus.
10202,SECT. VII.,
10203,SECT. VII.,Two remarks may be made on the deities of the first list.
10204,SECT. VII.,
10205,SECT. VII.,"First, that it comprehends generally the gods whom we shall find to"
10206,SECT. VII.,bear marks of being the most ancient among the Greek deities; with the
10207,SECT. VII.,"marked exception, however, of Minerva[516]."
10208,SECT. VII.,
10209,SECT. VII.,"Secondly, that in it we find no deity who takes part on the Greek,"
10210,SECT. VII.,"that is, the Pelasgian side, in the war of Troy. The only two names"
10211,SECT. VII.,"which do not appear on the Trojan side, are Vesta, who with Homer is"
10212,SECT. VII.,"not personified at all: and Proserpine, who from the seat of her dark"
10213,SECT. VII.,dominion could not share in the wars waged upon earth.
10214,SECT. VII.,
10215,SECT. VII.,"On the other hand, when we turn to the second list of exclusively Greek"
10216,SECT. VII.,"names, we find that it contains all the deities who took part against"
10217,SECT. VII.,Troy: and only two very secondary names of deities friendly to it.
10218,SECT. VII.,
10219,SECT. VII.,"Mars and Venus, both engaged on the Trojan side, and one standing in"
10220,SECT. VII.,"the first list, are the deities after whom, according to Ovid[517], the"
10221,SECT. VII.,two first months of the Roman year were named in the first age of the
10222,SECT. VII.,city.
10223,SECT. VII.,
10224,SECT. VII.,"It would not, however, be safe to depend implicitly upon the apparent"
10225,SECT. VII.,"reappearance of certain names in the Latin language, without a fuller"
10226,SECT. VII.,knowledge of the laws of discrimination between the early mythology
10227,SECT. VII.,"of the Romans, and the form which their religious system assumed at"
10228,SECT. VII.,the period when they came into free communication with Greece and its
10229,SECT. VII.,"colonies, from which, as they certainly borrowed some names of deities,"
10230,SECT. VII.,"such as Pallas and Phœbus, so they may have assumed others too. We have"
10231,SECT. VII.,"no proof, for example, that Apollo was prominent, or even that he was"
10232,SECT. VII.,"known, in the earliest Roman worship. Cicero[518] says, _Jam Apollinis"
10233,SECT. VII.,"nomen est Græcum_. Still, a temple was raised to him in Rome[519] as"
10234,SECT. VII.,early as 430 B. C.; and the Trojan sympathies of most of the deities
10235,SECT. VII.,in the first list tend in some degree to show both that they were well
10236,SECT. VII.,"known in the Pelasgian religion, and that many of the older portions"
10237,SECT. VII.,"of the mythology were common to the Trojans, the early Romans, and the"
10238,SECT. VII.,Pelasgians of Greece.
10239,SECT. VII.,
10240,SECT. VII.,_Pelasgian Religion less imaginative._
10241,SECT. VII.,
10242,SECT. VII.,"We may more boldly rely upon a general indication, which is offered to"
10243,SECT. VII.,"us by the religious systems both of Rome and of Troy, in comparison"
10244,SECT. VII.,with that of Greece.
10245,SECT. VII.,
10246,SECT. VII.,"The large account of Roman deities furnished by Saint Augustine, in"
10247,SECT. VII.,"his ‘De Civitate Dei,’ constitutes for us the principal representation"
10248,SECT. VII.,"of the great work of Varro, now lost, on the ‘Antiquitates Rerum"
10249,SECT. VII.,Divinarum.’ Notwithstanding the multitudinous development of the
10250,SECT. VII.,"theurgic system, the ‘_De Civitate_’ tends to support the belief that"
10251,SECT. VII.,"it was not vivified, like the system of the Greeks, by the intense"
10252,SECT. VII.,pervading power of a vigorous and prolific imagination. The ‘Fasti’ of
10253,SECT. VII.,Ovid may perhaps be referred to as sustaining the same opinion. And
10254,SECT. VII.,Heyne in his commentary on Virgil has observed upon the comparative
10255,SECT. VII.,dulness and dryness of the early mythology of Rome: _Italici mythi
10256,SECT. VII.,longe a Græcæ fabulæ suavitate absunt; nec varietas grata inest_[520].
10257,SECT. VII.,
10258,SECT. VII.,"In a later portion of this work[521] I shall endeavour to show, that"
10259,SECT. VII.,a similar character apparently attaches to the religious system of
10260,SECT. VII.,"Troy: not so much a purity or simplicity, as a comparative poverty"
10261,SECT. VII.,and hardness; and an indisposition in the inventions to assume those
10262,SECT. VII.,"graceful forms, of which the Grecian Theo-mythology, as exhibited in"
10263,SECT. VII.,"Homer, is so full."
10264,SECT. VII.,
10265,SECT. VII.,"And again, when we pass from Homer to Hesiod, we find a great mass"
10266,SECT. VII.,"of religious fable, either added by the later poet, or grown up in"
10267,SECT. VII.,the interval between the two. Hesiod’s depositories are much more
10268,SECT. VII.,numerously peopled: but we have passed at once from the poetry of a
10269,SECT. VII.,"theogony to its merest prose, when we compare his manner of touch or"
10270,SECT. VII.,"handling, and his ideas on these subjects, with those of Homer. And, as"
10271,SECT. VII.,on other grounds we may consider Hesiod to represent the Pelasgian side
10272,SECT. VII.,"of the Greek mind, we seem justified in referring the distinctive tone"
10273,SECT. VII.,of his mythology in some degree to his Pelasgian characteristics.
10274,SECT. VII.,
10275,SECT. VII.,"But independently of confirmation from the case of Troy, and from"
10276,SECT. VII.,"the tone of Hesiod, the character of the old Italian mythology, so"
10277,SECT. VII.,"devoid of imagination, force, and grace, leads us to ascribe these"
10278,SECT. VII.,"properties, when we find them abound in the Greek supernaturalism, to"
10279,SECT. VII.,"its non-Pelasgian, that is, to its Hellenic source."
10280,SECT. VII.,
10281,SECT. VII.,_Its ritual development fuller._
10282,SECT. VII.,
10283,SECT. VII.,"When, however, we turn to another form of development in religious"
10284,SECT. VII.,"systems, we find the case entirely different: I mean the development"
10285,SECT. VII.,"in positive observances of all kinds, and in fixed institutions of"
10286,SECT. VII.,property and class. Here the religion of Rome was large and copious.
10287,SECT. VII.,"Polybius has left upon record, in a most remarkable passage, his"
10288,SECT. VII.,"admiration of the Roman system of δεισιδαιμονία, which had, he says,"
10289,SECT. VII.,"been so got up, and carried to such a point, that it could not be"
10290,SECT. VII.,"exceeded. It was all done, in his opinion, on account of the multitude."
10291,SECT. VII.,"Were States composed of the wise, the case would have been different:"
10292,SECT. VII.,"but as the people are full of levity and passion, λείπεται τοῖς ἀδήλοις"
10293,SECT. VII.,φόβοις καὶ τῇ τοιαύτῃ τραγωδίᾳ τὰ πλήθη συνέχειν[522].
10294,SECT. VII.,
10295,SECT. VII.,"Not less remarkable is the testimony of Dionysius; who, while he"
10296,SECT. VII.,praises Romulus for the severe simplicity of what he caused to be
10297,SECT. VII.,"taught and held concerning religion, and for the expulsion of immoral"
10298,SECT. VII.,"fables and practices, says that he arranged for his people all that"
10299,SECT. VII.,"concerned the temples of the gods, their consecrated lands, their"
10300,SECT. VII.,"altars, their images, their forms, their _insignia_, their prerogatives"
10301,SECT. VII.,"and their gifts to man, the sacrifices in which they delight, the"
10302,SECT. VII.,"feasts and assemblies to be celebrated, and the remissions of labour"
10303,SECT. VII.,to be granted in their honour. In no other newly founded city could be
10304,SECT. VII.,"shown such a multitude of priests and ministers of the gods[523], who"
10305,SECT. VII.,"were chosen, too, from the most distinguished families[524]."
10306,SECT. VII.,
10307,SECT. VII.,The Fasti of Ovid give an idea of the manner in which the Roman
10308,SECT. VII.,Calendar brought the ceremonial of religion to bear upon the course
10309,SECT. VII.,of life. For some centuries an acquaintance with the Calendar was the
10310,SECT. VII.,exclusive property of the sacred order[525]; and the priesthood turned
10311,SECT. VII.,"to its own power and profit the knowledge, which afterwards filled the"
10312,SECT. VII.,pages of that characteristic work.
10313,SECT. VII.,
10314,SECT. VII.,"Again, we shall have occasion, when considering the distinctive"
10315,SECT. VII.,"character of Troy, to notice that the political and ritual forms of"
10316,SECT. VII.,"religion appear to have been much more advanced there, than with the"
10317,SECT. VII.,Greeks. This difference will naturally connect itself with the stronger
10318,SECT. VII.,Pelasgian infusion in the former case. We shall then find that of the
10319,SECT. VII.,"two great kinds of sacred office, one only, that of the μάντις, and not"
10320,SECT. VII.,"that of the priest, seems at the time of Homer to have appertained to"
10321,SECT. VII.,the Hellenic races.
10322,SECT. VII.,
10323,SECT. VII.,"And it is not a little curious to observe that, when Saint Paul"
10324,SECT. VII.,"arrives among the Athenians, the point which he selects for notice"
10325,SECT. VII.,"in their character and usages, after all the intermixtures they had"
10326,SECT. VII.,"undergone, is still this, that they are δεισιδαιμονέστεροι[526],"
10327,SECT. VII.,"peculiarly disposed to religious observances; and that, not contented"
10328,SECT. VII.,"with the gods whom they suppose themselves to know, they have likewise"
10329,SECT. VII.,a supernumerary altar for ‘the Unknown God.’ Nor are we the less
10330,SECT. VII.,warranted to connect this peculiarity with the original and long
10331,SECT. VII.,"preserved Pelasgian character of Athens, because that city had, for"
10332,SECT. VII.,"centuries before, become a peculiarly apt representative of the full"
10333,SECT. VII.,"Greek compound: for a system of ritual observance has a fixity,"
10334,SECT. VII.,"which does not belong to mere opinion; and, when once rooted in a"
10335,SECT. VII.,"country, has powerful tendencies to assume such a solidity as survives"
10336,SECT. VII.,vicissitude: perhaps in some degree on account of its neutral and
10337,SECT. VII.,"pacific character, and of the power it leaves to men of separating"
10338,SECT. VII.,between outward observance and inward act.
10339,SECT. VII.,
10340,SECT. VII.,"Although the opinion has been entertained, that from the earliest ages"
10341,SECT. VII.,"it was the exclusive privilege of the first-born to offer sacrifice,"
10342,SECT. VII.,"it appears most probable that the separate function of priesthood was,"
10343,SECT. VII.,"like other offices and professions, one of gradual formation. Whether"
10344,SECT. VII.,"the primitive institution of sacrifice was spontaneous or commanded,"
10345,SECT. VII.,"every man, that is to say, every head of a family, was, I shall assume,"
10346,SECT. VII.,"at first his own offerer or priest[527]. Then, as the household"
10347,SECT. VII.,"developed into the community, the priestly office, in the first stages"
10348,SECT. VII.,"of political society, as a matter of course appertained to the chief."
10349,SECT. VII.,
10350,SECT. VII.,"He, by the necessity of natural order, originally united in his own"
10351,SECT. VII.,person the great functions of
10352,SECT. VII.,
10353,SECT. VII.,1. Father.
10354,SECT. VII.,2. Teacher.
10355,SECT. VII.,3. Priest.
10356,SECT. VII.,4. King.
10357,SECT. VII.,5. Proprietor.
10358,SECT. VII.,6. Commander.
10359,SECT. VII.,
10360,SECT. VII.,The severance of these offices successively would arrive sooner or
10361,SECT. VII.,"later, according as the progress made in numbers and wealth was rapid"
10362,SECT. VII.,or slow. Concentration of employments in a single hand marks the
10363,SECT. VII.,"primitive condition or retarded movement of society, while the division"
10364,SECT. VII.,of labour is the sign of more speedy and more advanced development.
10365,SECT. VII.,Even the annals of the people of Israel furnish instances in which
10366,SECT. VII.,"we trace, at periods when these offices had undergone division under"
10367,SECT. VII.,"divine authority, vestiges of their former union. It appears that,"
10368,SECT. VII.,"besides Moses, who consecrated Aaron and his sons by divine command,"
10369,SECT. VII.,"Joshua, Samuel, and Saul[528] on certain occasions offered sacrifice."
10370,SECT. VII.,"The exclusive character of priesthood has been impressed upon it,"
10371,SECT. VII.,"under Divine Revelation, by positive ordinance, and for a special"
10372,SECT. VII.,purpose[529].
10373,SECT. VII.,
10374,SECT. VII.,_Order of Priests not Hellenic._
10375,SECT. VII.,
10376,SECT. VII.,The Hellenes in Homer appear to exhibit it in its earlier state
10377,SECT. VII.,of union with the office of civil government; and the Pelasgians
10378,SECT. VII.,to display it as a function which has indeed become special and
10379,SECT. VII.,"professional, but only on that self-acting principle which, in the"
10380,SECT. VII.,"progress of society, leads to division of labour."
10381,SECT. VII.,
10382,SECT. VII.,"If we suppose the case of two races, one of them inhabiting a rude and"
10383,SECT. VII.,"barren country in a state of perpetual poverty and warfare, and then"
10384,SECT. VII.,"recently, by a descent upon more fertile soils, brought into contact"
10385,SECT. VII.,with civilised life: the other of them addicted from a much earlier
10386,SECT. VII.,"period to pursuits of peace and industry, inhabiting plains, and"
10387,SECT. VII.,accustomed to form agricultural settlements; there will be no cause
10388,SECT. VII.,for wonder upon our also finding that the latter of these races has
10389,SECT. VII.,"a professional priesthood, while the former has none; but that the"
10390,SECT. VII.,sacrificial office remains in the private dwelling with the father
10391,SECT. VII.,"of the family, and on public occasions with the head of the civil"
10392,SECT. VII.,government.
10393,SECT. VII.,
10394,SECT. VII.,This appears to have been the state of facts as between the Trojans
10395,SECT. VII.,"of Homer who had a priesthood, and the Hellenes who had none: and the"
10396,SECT. VII.,difference may be principally referable to the different condition
10397,SECT. VII.,and history of the Pelasgian and the Hellic races: while other
10398,SECT. VII.,"causes, belonging to the respective characters of the races, may have"
10399,SECT. VII.,contributed their share towards the production of this curious result.
10400,SECT. VII.,Partly the greater personal energy and self-reliance of the Hellic
10401,SECT. VII.,"tribes, but partly also the earlier and older ease, wealth, and fixity"
10402,SECT. VII.,"of the Pelasgians, are the probable reasons why, at the point of time"
10403,SECT. VII.,"exhibited in the writings of Homer, we find priesthood properly a"
10404,SECT. VII.,"Pelasgian, but not yet properly an Hellenic, and only to a limited"
10405,SECT. VII.,"extent an adoptive, institution."
10406,SECT. VII.,
10407,SECT. VII.,"Thus far, then, we have a presumption, to be greatly strengthened"
10408,SECT. VII.,"as I trust hereafter, that the Greek religion owed to the Hellenes"
10409,SECT. VII.,"its imaginative, and to the Pelasgians its sacerdotal and ceremonial"
10410,SECT. VII.,"development. And this presumption is, I think, in entire accordance"
10411,SECT. VII.,"with what we should reasonably anticipate, from relations otherwise"
10412,SECT. VII.,known to have subsisted between the two races. I now pass on to the
10413,SECT. VII.,subject of language.
10414,SECT. VII.,
10415,SECT. VII.,_Contributions to language._
10416,SECT. VII.,
10417,SECT. VII.,In attempting to illustrate the relations of Pelasgians to Hellenes
10418,SECT. VII.,through the medium of the affinities and contrasts between the Greek
10419,SECT. VII.,"and Latin languages, I am aware that I venture upon ground which"
10420,SECT. VII.,requires to be trodden with great circumspection. For the Latin nation
10421,SECT. VII.,may possibly have contained within itself some ethnical element not
10422,SECT. VII.,"dissimilar to the Hellenic, as well as one substantially corresponding"
10423,SECT. VII.,"with the Pelasgian, factor of the Greek people. And again, there is a"
10424,SECT. VII.,very extended relation of the two languages to a common root in the
10425,SECT. VII.,Sanscrit. The number of words traceable to such a root has recently
10426,SECT. VII.,"been stated at 339 in the Greek, and 319 in the Latin tongues[530]. We"
10427,SECT. VII.,"must not then, it will justly be observed, infer from the simple fact"
10428,SECT. VII.,"of resemblance between a Greek and a Latin word, that the one has been"
10429,SECT. VII.,borrowed or directly modified from the other.
10430,SECT. VII.,
10431,SECT. VII.,"Let us begin by considering the just effect of these remarks, and"
10432,SECT. VII.,inquiring whether they do not still leave space enough for an useful
10433,SECT. VII.,examination.
10434,SECT. VII.,
10435,SECT. VII.,"I begin from the assumption, that there was a deep and broad Pelasgian"
10436,SECT. VII.,"_substratum_ both in the Greek and the Roman nations. It is thought,"
10437,SECT. VII.,"and it may perhaps be justly thought, that a dominant tribe of Oscans,"
10438,SECT. VII.,"who were a nation of warriors and hunters, came among the Pelasgi of"
10439,SECT. VII.,"Italy, as the Hellenes came among the Pelasgi of Greece. But while we"
10440,SECT. VII.,may properly assume the identity of the Pelasgian factor in the two
10441,SECT. VII.,"cases respectively, it is quite plain that the compounds or aggregate"
10442,SECT. VII.,"characters are broadly distinguished, and represent an assemblage and"
10443,SECT. VII.,"admixture either of different qualities, or else of the same qualities"
10444,SECT. VII.,in very different proportions. Therefore we are justified in laying
10445,SECT. VII.,"it down as a general rule, that whatever is found in the language of"
10446,SECT. VII.,"the two countries alike was most probably Pelasgian: since, if that"
10447,SECT. VII.,portion of the aggregate language had been supplied from those elements
10448,SECT. VII.,"in which the nations differed, it is likely that a corresponding"
10449,SECT. VII.,difference would have been found to prevail between their modes of
10450,SECT. VII.,speech.
10451,SECT. VII.,
10452,SECT. VII.,"Again, I think we must distinguish between the simple fact of"
10453,SECT. VII.,"derivation from an original source in common, and those degrees or"
10454,SECT. VII.,descriptions of resemblance which show that any given words not only
10455,SECT. VII.,"had one source at first, but that they continued together up to a"
10456,SECT. VII.,"certain point in the formative process, so as to be capable, from their"
10457,SECT. VII.,"shape, of derivation, not only from that root, but also one from the"
10458,SECT. VII.,"other. For instance, the Greek ἐγὼ and the Latin _ego_ are both stated"
10459,SECT. VII.,to be derived from the Sanscrit _aham_. But here it is quite plain that
10460,SECT. VII.,"they have not only set out from the same point, but travelled along"
10461,SECT. VII.,"the same road to their journey’s end, as the Greek and Latin words are"
10462,SECT. VII.,"identical. On the other hand, if we take the Greek τέσσαρες, and the"
10463,SECT. VII.,"Latin _quatuor_, both are referred to the same Sanscrit root, _chatur_:"
10464,SECT. VII.,"but neither of them can well have been derived from the other, and each"
10465,SECT. VII.,is more nearly related to the root than it is to the other. Or if we
10466,SECT. VII.,"take the Latin _anser_, the Greek χὴν, and the English ‘goose,’ these"
10467,SECT. VII.,"words scarcely appear to have a connecting link: but it is found, and"
10468,SECT. VII.,"a remote or mediate connection established, by means of the German"
10469,SECT. VII.,_gans_. Instances might easily be multiplied.
10470,SECT. VII.,
10471,SECT. VII.,"In single cases, where the relationship of words is only of the kind"
10472,SECT. VII.,"last exemplified, it would not be safe to draw inferences to the"
10473,SECT. VII.,effect of their being respectively due to this or that element in the
10474,SECT. VII.,composition of the nation.
10475,SECT. VII.,
10476,SECT. VII.,But where there is such a similarity as to show either that the word
10477,SECT. VII.,has advanced nearly to its mature state before the Greek and Latin
10478,SECT. VII.,"forms began to divaricate, or that the Latin form may have been derived"
10479,SECT. VII.,"from the Greek in an early stage of the history of the language, or"
10480,SECT. VII.,"_vice versâ_, then it seems just to refer the resemblance of terms to"
10481,SECT. VII.,the existence of a powerful common element in the two peoples.
10482,SECT. VII.,
10483,SECT. VII.,"And further, if we shall find that the words standing in close kindred"
10484,SECT. VII.,"are capable of classification with reference to their sense, then, when"
10485,SECT. VII.,"we have once constituted a class of such words, it may be justifiable"
10486,SECT. VII.,"to add fresh words to it on the strength of a more remote affinity,"
10487,SECT. VII.,"in virtue of the presumption already created. For instance, if the"
10488,SECT. VII.,names of the commonest objects and operations of inanimate nature are
10489,SECT. VII.,"generally in close correspondence, we may infer a relation between"
10490,SECT. VII.,"other words which are in the same class as to meaning, though they may"
10491,SECT. VII.,"be not so nearly alike, with more confidence than if the reasoning"
10492,SECT. VII.,as to this latter section were not supported by the former. On this
10493,SECT. VII.,principle I proceed in the collections of words given below.
10494,SECT. VII.,
10495,SECT. VII.,Of course the utmost care must be taken to exclude those words which
10496,SECT. VII.,"have been copied from Greek into Latin, after the literary ages of Rome"
10497,SECT. VII.,"had begun, and according to the practice which Horace has described and"
10498,SECT. VII.,recommended[531].
10499,SECT. VII.,
10500,SECT. VII.,_Niebuhr’s propositions._
10501,SECT. VII.,
10502,SECT. VII.,"Niebuhr was, I believe, the first person to draw from philological"
10503,SECT. VII.,sources a conclusion as to the character and habits of the Pelasgians.
10504,SECT. VII.,"He proceeded upon the threefold assertion, (1) that the words common"
10505,SECT. VII.,"to the two tongues are presumably Pelasgian, (2) that they for the"
10506,SECT. VII.,"most part refer to tillage and the gentler ways of life, and (3) that"
10507,SECT. VII.,we may hence conclude that the Pelasgians were a people given to peace
10508,SECT. VII.,"and husbandry. And conversely, that the words which widely differ in"
10509,SECT. VII.,"the two tongues are not Pelasgian, and that the pursuits which they"
10510,SECT. VII.,indicate must have been more peculiarly characteristic of some other
10511,SECT. VII.,"race, that contributed to make up the composition of the Roman nation."
10512,SECT. VII.,"The principles thus assumed by Niebuhr[532] appear, when placed under"
10513,SECT. VII.,"due limitation, to be sound; and the only question is, whether they are"
10514,SECT. VII.,supported by the facts of the case. If in a given language we find the
10515,SECT. VII.,words indicative of a certain turn of life to have been derived from a
10516,SECT. VII.,"particular race, which forms part of the nation speaking that language,"
10517,SECT. VII.,"while other words, referable to other habits and pursuits, have been"
10518,SECT. VII.,"supplied by other races also numbered among its constituent parts, it"
10519,SECT. VII.,is just to read the characters of those races respectively through the
10520,SECT. VII.,character of the words that they contribute to the common tongue. For
10521,SECT. VII.,the question is really one of forces which may have been adjusted with
10522,SECT. VII.,"as much accuracy, as if they had been purely mechanical. The ordinary"
10523,SECT. VII.,reason why a word of Pelasgian origin prevails over a word of Hellenic
10524,SECT. VII.,"origin with the same signification, or the reverse, is that it is in"
10525,SECT. VII.,more or in less common use: and the commonness of use is likely to be
10526,SECT. VII.,"determined by the degree in which the employment or state of life, with"
10527,SECT. VII.,"which the word is connected, may belong to the one race or the other."
10528,SECT. VII.,
10529,SECT. VII.,The survey taken by Niebuhr appears to have been rapid; and the list
10530,SECT. VII.,of words supplied by him is very meagre. Bishop Marsh[533] and other
10531,SECT. VII.,"authors have, with a variety of views, supplied further materials. The"
10532,SECT. VII.,"most comprehensive list, to which my attention has been directed, is"
10533,SECT. VII.,in the ‘Lateinische Synonyme und Etymologieen’ of Döderlein[534]. The
10534,SECT. VII.,subject is essentially one which hardly admits of a fixed criterion or
10535,SECT. VII.,"authoritative rule, or of a full assurance that its limits have been"
10536,SECT. VII.,"reached. Mindful of the reserve which these considerations recommend, I"
10537,SECT. VII.,should not wish to lay down inflexible propositions. But I venture to
10538,SECT. VII.,"state generally, that those words of the Latin and Greek tongues, which"
10539,SECT. VII.,"are in the closest relationship, are connected"
10540,SECT. VII.,
10541,SECT. VII.,"1. With the elementary structure of language, such as pronouns,"
10542,SECT. VII.,"prepositions, numerals."
10543,SECT. VII.,
10544,SECT. VII.,2. With the earliest state of society.
10545,SECT. VII.,
10546,SECT. VII.,"3. With the pursuits of peaceful and rural industry, not of highly"
10547,SECT. VII.,skilled labour.

10549,SECT. VII.,_Classes of words which agree._
10550,SECT. VII.,
10551,SECT. VII.,"Examples, numerous enough to show a most extensive agreement, will"
10552,SECT. VII.,readily suggest themselves under the first head. To illustrate the
10553,SECT. VII.,"other propositions, though it can only be done imperfectly, I will"
10554,SECT. VII.,"follow both the positive and the negative methods. The first, by"
10555,SECT. VII.,"comparing words which denote elementary objects, both of animate"
10556,SECT. VII.,"and inanimate nature, or the simplest products of human labour for"
10557,SECT. VII.,"the supply of human wants, or the members of the human body, or the"
10558,SECT. VII.,"rudiments of social order. The second, by contrasting the words which"
10559,SECT. VII.,"relate (1) to intelligence and mental operations, (2) to war, and (3)"
10560,SECT. VII.,"to the metals, the extended use of which denotes a certain degree of"
10561,SECT. VII.,"social advancement. It will I hope be borne in mind, on the one hand,"
10562,SECT. VII.,"that these lists are given by way of instance, and have no pretension"
10563,SECT. VII.,"to be exhaustive: and, on the other hand, that exceptions, discovered"
10564,SECT. VII.,"here and there, to the rule they seem to indicate, would in no way"
10565,SECT. VII.,"disprove its existence, but should themselves, if purely exceptions, be"
10566,SECT. VII.,"treated, provisionally at least, as accidental."

10813,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10814,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,A very extensive list of perhaps one hundred or more verbs might be
10815,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"added, which are either identical or nearly related in the Greek and"
10816,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Latin languages: but it would not, I think, materially enlarge or"
10817,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,diminish the general effect of those words which have been enumerated.
10818,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,We have before us about one hundred and eighty words in the classes of
10819,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,substantive and adjective only. They might nearly form the primitive
10820,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"vocabulary of a rustic and pacific people. Two exceptions may be named,"
10821,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"which may deserve remark. It will be observed, that the senses are"
10822,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"inadequately represented, only two of them, smell and taste, being"
10823,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,included. The other three are also connected in the two languages as
10824,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"follows: touch, by the relation of θιγγάνω and _tango_: sight, by εἴδω"
10825,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and _video_: hearing, by the evident connection of the Latin _audire_"
10826,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"with the Greek αὔδη, the proper name in Homer for the voice."
10827,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10828,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,The other marked exception is that of religion. With slender
10829,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"exceptions, such as θεὸς = _deus_, the connection of _rex_ with ῥέζω,"
10830,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of _numen_ with νεύω, of λοιβὴ with _libo_, and that of ἀράομαι,"
10831,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"ἀρητὴρ with _orare_, _orator_, _ara_, there is a considerable want of"
10832,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"correspondence in the leading words, such as ἱερὸς, ἅγιος, θύω, βῶμος,"
10833,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"νῆον, ἄγαλμα, σέβω, μάντις, of the one tongue, and _sacer_, _sanctus_,"
10834,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"_pius_, _templum_, _vates_, _macto_, _mola_, of the other. The greater"
10835,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,part of the Pelasgian vocabulary must have been displaced on the one
10836,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,side or on the other: and as it is in Greece that we have much fuller
10837,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and clearer evidence of the advent of a superior race, which gave its"
10838,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"own impress to life and the mind in the higher departments of thought,"
10839,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"we must conclude that this substitution probably took place in Greece,"
10840,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and was of Hellenic for Pelasgian words.
10841,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10842,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The proposition of Niebuhr with respect to terms of war, appears to me"
10843,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,to be in the main well sustained by the facts. Let us take for example
10844,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the following list: which appears to show that, in this department,"
10845,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,with the exception of a pretty close relation between βέλος and
10846,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"_telum_, and a more remote one between πόλεμος and _bellum_, possibly"
10847,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"also between _lorica_ and θώρηξ, there is hardly in any case the"
10848,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,faintest sign of relationship between the customary terms employed in
10849,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the two languages for the respective objects.

10900,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"It can hardly, I think, be questioned, that this class of words"
10901,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,presents on the whole a very marked contrast to those which were before
10902,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,exhibited. And as we see the highest martial energies of Greece
10903,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"manifestly represented in the Hellenes, we may the more confidently"
10904,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,adopt that inference as to the habits of Hellenes and Pelasgians
10905,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"respectively, which the contrast between the two languages of itself"
10906,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,vividly suggests.
10907,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10908,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Before quitting this head of the subject, let us notice the wide"
10909,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,difference in the channels by which the two languages arrive at the
10910,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,words intended to represent the highest excellence. For ‘better’ the
10911,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Greeks have βέλτερος, from βέλος, ‘a dart,’ and for ‘best,’ ἄριστος,"
10912,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"from ἄρης, ‘war;’ while the Latins are contented with _optimus_, formed"
10913,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"from a common root with _opes_, ‘wealth.’"
10914,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10915,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,There is almost as remarkable a want of correspondence between the two
10916,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"languages in respect to the higher ideas, both intellectual and moral,"
10917,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,as in regard to war.
10918,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10919,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"In three words indeed we may trace a clear etymological relationship,"
10920,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"but in two of the cases with a total, and in the third with an"
10921,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,important change in the meaning.
10922,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10923,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,1. The μένος of the Greeks becomes the Latin _mens_; so that a
10924,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"particular quality, and that one belonging to the πάθη rather than the"
10925,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"ἤθη of man, comes to stand for the entire mind."
10926,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10927,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"2. The Greek ἄνεμος is evidently the Latin _animus_: or, that word"
10928,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,which remains the symbol of a sensible object in Greek becomes
10929,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the representative of mind in Latin. The adjective ἀνεμώλιος is
10930,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,indeed capable of a metaphysical application: but it means ‘of no
10931,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,account[543].’
10932,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10933,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,3. The θυμὸς of the Greeks is the _fumus_ of the Latins: and the case
10934,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,last described is exactly reversed.
10935,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10936,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,The three great words in the early Greek for the unseen or spiritual
10937,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"powers of man’s nature are νόος, φρὴν, and ψυχή. They perhaps"
10938,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"correspond most nearly with the three Latin words _mens_, _indoles_,"
10939,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and _vita_[544]. There is not the slightest sign of conformity
10940,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,or common origin in any of the cases; although νόος is akin to
10941,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,_nosco_[545].
10942,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10943,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,In two other very important words we find perhaps derivation from a
10944,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"common root, but nothing like a near or direct relationship. The Greek"
10945,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"ἀρετὴ may proceed from the same stock with the Latin _virtus_, and in"
10946,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,like manner ἄτη may have the same source as _vitium_.
10947,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10948,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Upon the whole we may conclude, that in this important class of words"
10949,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the resemblances are scanty and remote. It will be seen that under
10950,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the head of general ideas there is not included any clear case of
10951,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,correspondence in a mental quality; and all the resemblances appear to
10952,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"rest, mediately or immediately, upon sensible objects and phenomena."
10953,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10954,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"As respects the terms employed in navigation, it will have been"
10955,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"observed, that they are all connected with its rudest form, that of"
10956,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"rowing; and that they do not include the words for mast, yard, or sail,"
10957,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,in all of which the two tongues appear to be entirely separated.
10958,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10959,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Again, it may be stated generally, that society in its very earliest"
10960,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,stages has little to do with the use of metals. This rule will be
10961,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of various application, according to their abundance or scarcity in"
10962,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"various countries, and according to the facility with which they are"
10963,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,convertible to the uses of man. As the objects of enjoyment multiply
10964,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"with the continuance and growth of industry, the precious metals become"
10965,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,more desirable with a view to exchange. But the principal metal for
10966,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"direct utility is iron: and of that, the quantity known and used by the"
10967,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Greeks would appear, even in the time of Homer, to have been extremely"
10968,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"small. The use of metal for works of art, and probably also for"
10969,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"commercial exchange, would seem to have been derived from Phœnician,"
10970,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,not Pelasgian sources; and we have no proof that when Homer lived they
10971,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,had acquired the art in any high degree for themselves.
10972,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10973,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,The absence of any great progress in the use of metals may thus be set
10974,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,down as a sign of Pelasgianism. And now let us compare the Greek and
10975,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Roman names for the metals respectively:
10976,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10977,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"1. χρυσὸς, aurum."
10978,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10979,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"2. ἄργυρος, argentum."
10980,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10981,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"3. χαλκὸς, æs."
10982,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10983,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"4. σίδηρος, ferrum."
10984,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10985,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"5. μόλιβος, plumbus: in later Greek μόλυβδος, the form nearest to the"
10986,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Latin.
10987,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10988,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"6. κασσίτερος, stannum."
10989,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10990,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Here also there is a great want of correspondence. Only in iron and
10991,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"lead, and possibly in silver, are there signs of relationship: but in"
10992,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,all it is remote. In the other metals it is entirely wanting; and in
10993,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"those which are nearest, it amounts only to presumptive derivation from"
10994,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,a common root. The want of community in this class of terms seems to
10995,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"show, that the race which was the common factor of the two nations,"
10996,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,was probably not advanced in the use of metals beyond their elementary
10997,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,purposes.
10998,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
10999,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"I will only further observe, that while so many names indicative of"
11000,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"social and domestic relations are akin, nothing can be more clearly"
11001,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,separate than the Greek δοῦλος and the Latin _servus_. From this fact
11002,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"it would be no improbable inference, that slavery was unknown to the"
11003,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Pelasgians: and their ignorance of it would, on the other hand, be"
11004,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,in the closest harmony with their slight concern in warlike and in
11005,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"maritime pursuits; since captivity in the one, and kidnapping through"
11006,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the other, were the two great feeders of the institution. It is also"
11007,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"in close correspondence with the further hypothesis, which represents"
11008,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the Pelasgians as probably the race that first occupied the Greek soil,"
11009,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and found no predecessors upon it over whom to establish political or
11010,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,proprietary dominion[546].
11011,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11012,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"It may, I think, deserve notice in confirmation of the general"
11013,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"argument, that almost all those Greek words, which are in close"
11014,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"affinity with the Latin, are found in Homer. For there can be little"
11015,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"doubt that, after his time, the Greek tongue became more and more"
11016,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Hellenic: and the fact that a word is Homeric supplies the most
11017,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,probable token of a link with a Pelasgian origin.
11018,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11019,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,And now let us sum up under this head of discussion.
11020,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11021,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"It may be said with very general truth, that the words which have"
11022,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"been quoted, and the classes to which they belong, have reference to"
11023,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the primary experience and to the elementary wants and productions of
11024,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,life: but that they do not touch the range of subjects belonging to
11025,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"civilization and the highest powers of man, such as war, art, policy,"
11026,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and song.
11027,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11028,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"But if the evidence goes to show, that the Pelasgian tongue supplied"
11029,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,both the Latin and the Greek nations with most of the principal
11030,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"elementary words, and with those which express the main ideas connected"
11031,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"with rural industry, the inference strongly arises, 1. That they"
11032,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"constituted the base of the Greek nation; and, 2. that, originally"
11033,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"cultivators of the soil for themselves, there came upon them a time"
11034,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"when other tribes acquired the mastery among them, so that thenceforth"
11035,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,they had to cultivate it under the government of others. The case of
11036,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the Pelasgian vocabulary in the Latin and in the Greek languages would
11037,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,thus appear to resemble the Saxon contribution to the English tongue:
11038,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and it is likely that something like the general position, which we"
11039,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"know to be denoted in the one case, is also similarly to be inferred in"
11040,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the other.
11041,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11042,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,_Evidence from names of persons._
11043,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11044,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"No inconsiderable light may, I think, be thrown upon the character and"
11045,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"pursuits of the Pelasgian and Hellenic races respectively, from an"
11046,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,examination of the etymology of the names of persons contained in the
11047,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Homeric poems. For the names of men, in the early stages of society,"
11048,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"are so frequently drawn direct from their pursuits and habits, that the"
11049,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"ideas, on which they are founded, may serve to guide us to a knowledge"
11050,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,of the character and occupations of a people.
11051,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11052,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,By way of summary proof that a connection prevailed (whether the names
11053,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"be fictitious or not, I care not, for this purpose, to inquire,)"
11054,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"between the Homeric names, and the pursuits and habits of those who"
11055,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"bear them, I may refer to the names of Phæacians and Ithacans. Of the"
11056,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"latter, which are numerous, not one is derived from the horse; and we"
11057,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,know[547] that no horses were used in Ithaca. The former are chiefly
11058,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,composed of words connected with the sea: in conformity with the fact
11059,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,that the pursuits of the people are represented by Homer as thoroughly
11060,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,maritime.
11061,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11062,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The names of persons in Homer are extremely numerous, amounting to many"
11063,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"hundreds. It would be hazardous, as a general rule, to assume for them"
11064,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"an historical character, except in the cases of such individuals as,"
11065,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"from general eminence or local connection, or from some particular"
11066,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"gift or circumstance, were likely to be held in remembrance. In some"
11067,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"cases, as we have already seen[548], they bear the marks of invention"
11068,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,upon them. But this question is little material for the present
11069,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"purpose: and indeed the probability that we ought, as a general rule,"
11070,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,to regard the less distinguished names as fabricated for the purposes
11071,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of the poem, makes it the more reasonable that we should turn to them"
11072,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"to see how far they connect themselves with distinctions of pursuit,"
11073,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"character, and race, and what properties and characteristics, when so"
11074,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"connected, they appear to indicate as having been assigned by Homer to"
11075,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,one race or to another.
11076,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11077,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,We must not expect to arrive at anything better than general and
11078,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"approximate conclusions; for particular circumstances, unknown to us,"
11079,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"may have varied the course of etymological nomenclature, and it may"
11080,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"also happen, that in a great number of cases we cannot securely trace"
11081,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,etymology at all.
11082,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11083,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Subject to these cautions, I would observe, first, that the evidence"
11084,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"from other sources generally tends to show,"
11085,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11086,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"1. That the Trojans, except as to the royal house[549], and perhaps a"
11087,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"few other distinguished families, were Pelasgian."
11088,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11089,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,2. That the base of the Greek army and nation were Pelasgian: with
11090,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"an infusion of Hellenic tribes, not families merely, who held the"
11091,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"governing power and probably formed the upper, that is, the proprietary"
11092,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and military, class of the community, in most parts of Greece."
11093,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11094,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,3. That some parts of the Greek peninsula present little or no mark of
11095,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Hellenic influences; particularly Attica and Arcadia.
11096,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11097,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,4. That the Lycians appear to approximate more than the other races
11098,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"on the Trojan side to the high Greek type, and to present either the"
11099,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Hellenic element, or some element akin to it, in a marked form."
11100,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11101,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,The investigation of individual names occurring singly would be
11102,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"endless, and often equivocal: but Homer frequently unites many names"
11103,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"in a group under circumstances, which authorize us to assume a common"
11104,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"origin and character for the persons designated: and others, though he"
11105,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"may not collect them together in the same passage, are yet associated"
11106,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,in virtue of palpable relations between them.
11107,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11108,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"An examination of Homeric names, in the groups thus gathered, has"
11109,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,brought me to the following results:
11110,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11111,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"1. Where we have reason to presume an Hellenic extraction, a large"
11112,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"proportion of those names, of which the etymology can be traced,"
11113,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"appear to express ideas connected with glory, political power, mental"
11114,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"fortitude, energy and ability, martial courage and strength, or"
11115,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,military operations.
11116,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11117,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"2. But where we may more reasonably suppose, in part or in whole, a"
11118,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Pelasgic stock, ideas of this kind are more rarely expressed, and"
11119,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"another vein of etymology appears, founded on rural habits, abodes,"
11120,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and pursuits, or the creation and care of worldly goods, or on other"
11121,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"properties or occupations less akin to political and martial pursuits,"
11122,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,or to high birth and station.
11123,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11124,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"It is at the same time worth remark that, among the slaves of the"
11125,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Odyssey, we find names of a more high-born cast than those most"
11126,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"current among the Pelasgians. Such as Eumæus (μάω, to desire eagerly"
11127,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and strive after), Euryclea, (who moreover is daughter of Ops the son"
11128,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of Peisenor,) Eurymedusa (in Scheria), and Alcippe (at Sparta[550])."
11129,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"There were two causes, to which this might be referable: first, that"
11130,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,high-born slaves were often obtained both by kidnapping and by war;
11131,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Eumæus, as we know, was of this class. And secondly, that the names"
11132,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of their lords may then, as now, have been occasionally given them."
11133,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,So that the high significations connected with servile names do not
11134,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,constitute an objection to the rules which have been stated.
11135,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11136,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"There is another class of names, which requires especial notice. They"
11137,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,are those which have reference to the horse. The rearing and care of
11138,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the horse are in Homer more connected with the Trojans, than with the"
11139,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Greeks: and his standing epithet, ἱπποδάμος, is more largely employed"
11140,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"on the Trojan side[551]. The horse was not exclusively, perhaps not"
11141,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"principally, employed in war and games. He was used in travelling also:"
11142,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,he may have been employed as a beast of burden: he certainly drew the
11143,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"plough, though Homer informs us that in this occupation the mule was"
11144,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,preferable.
11145,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11146,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The points at which we may expect to find names chiefly Pelasgian,"
11147,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"besides those which are expressly given us as such, will be these three:"
11148,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11149,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"1. In connection with some particular parts of Greece, especially"
11150,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Attica or Arcadia.
11151,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11152,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,2. Among the masses of the common Greek soldiery.
11153,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11154,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"3. Still more unequivocally among the masses of the Trojan force, and"
11155,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of the auxiliaries generally; except the Lycians, whom we have seen"
11156,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"reason to presume to have been less Pelasgian, and more allied, or at"
11157,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"least more similar, to the Hellic races."
11158,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11159,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"On the other hand we may presume Hellic blood, or what in Homer’s"
11160,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"estimation was akin to it, among the Lycians, and likewise wherever"
11161,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"we find, especially on the Greek side, any considerable collection of"
11162,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"names appertaining to the higher class or aristocracy of the army, or"
11163,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,of the country.
11164,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11165,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,_Names of the Pelasgian Class._
11166,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11167,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The Homeric names, which are given us as expressly Pelasgian, are four"
11168,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,only; and they belong to the Pelasgian force on the Trojan side.
11169,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11170,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,1. Hippothous.
11171,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,2. Pulæus.
11172,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,3. Lethus.
11173,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,4. Teutamus[552].
11174,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11175,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The etymology of the three first names seems obvious enough: and,"
11176,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"though the persons are all rulers among their people, not one of them"
11177,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,unequivocally presents the characteristics which we should regard as
11178,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"appropriate in Hellic names: although, from their being of the highest"
11179,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"rank, we should be less surprised if the case were otherwise."
11180,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11181,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"As regards the first of the four, upon examining the class of names"
11182,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"relating to the horse in the poems, we find, as far as I have observed,"
11183,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,only Hipponous[553] among the Greeks. This rank does not clearly
11184,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"appear: but νόος, the second factor of the word, supplies the higher"
11185,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,element.
11186,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11187,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"On the other side, in addition to Hippolochus, a name meaning"
11188,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"horse-ambush, who was both Lycian and royal, we have Hippasus,"
11189,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Hippodamas, Hippodamus, Hippocoon, Hippomachus, and Hippotion. We have"
11190,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"likewise,"
11191,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11192,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Melanippus, (Il. xvi. 695.)"
11193,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Echepolus, (Il. xvi. 417.)"
11194,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Euippus, (Il. xvi. 417.)"
11195,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11196,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Take again Pulæus, from πύλη. This name may mean porter or gate-keeper:"
11197,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,it is scarcely susceptible of a high sense. In connection with the
11198,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"character of the Pelasgians as masons and builders of walled places, it"
11199,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"is appropriate to them. Homer has three other names, and no more, which"
11200,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"appear to be founded simply upon the term gate: Πύλων, Πυλάρτης, and"
11201,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Πυλαιμένης. They are all on the Trojan side.
11202,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11203,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Next, we have a larger class of names, where a strong infusion of the"
11204,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Pelasgic character may be expected: namely, those connected with Attica."
11205,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11206,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Among these, three belong to its royal house, and in them we find no"
11207,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"certain features of the Pelasgian kind. They are,"
11208,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11209,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"1. Erechtheus,   }"
11210,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"2. Peteos,       } From Il. ii. 547-52."
11211,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"3. Menestheus,   }"
11212,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11213,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The last of the three, however, seems, if derived from μένος, to belong"
11214,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,to the higher class of names.
11215,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11216,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Besides these three there are,"
11217,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11218,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"4. Pheidas,   }"
11219,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"5. Stichius,  } Il. xiii. 690, 1."
11220,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"6. Bias,      }"
11221,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11222,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"7. Iasus,     }"
11223,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"8. Sphelus,   } Il. xv. 332, 7, 8."
11224,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,9. Boucolus.  }
11225,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11226,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Now the whole of these are commanders or officers; and yet four of
11227,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"them, Pheidas (φείδω), Stichius (στείχω), Sphelus (σφάλλω), and"
11228,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Boucolus (βούκολος), are in a marked manner of the Pelasgian class:"
11229,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Bias (βίη), may perhaps belong to it, as meaning mere physical force:"
11230,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and on the etymology of the ancient name Iasus I do not venture to
11231,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"speculate. Boucolus, like Boucolion, which we shall meet presently,"
11232,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,deserves particular attention: we find nothing at all resembling it
11233,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,among the names which are (on other grounds) presumably Hellic.
11234,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11235,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Other names in the poems, which there may be some reason, from their"
11236,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"local connection, to presume Pelasgian, are,"
11237,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11238,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"1. Lycoorgus,   } From Il. vii. 136, 149, where"
11239,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"2. Ereuthalion, } they are described as Arcadians."
11240,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"3. Dmetor, Lord of Cyprus, from Od. xvii. 443."
11241,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11242,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"And perhaps we may add,"
11243,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11244,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"4. An Ion or Ian, as head of the Ἰάονες."
11245,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"5. An Apis, the early eponymist of the Peloponnesus, or a part of"
11246,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,it[554].
11247,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11248,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Now, though these are all rulers and great personages, the name Dmetor"
11249,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,is the only one among them which seems in any degree to present
11250,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Hellenic ideas: nor need that mean a subduer of men; it may as well
11251,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"mean simply a breaker of horses. Apis, we have every reason to suppose,"
11252,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"means the ox. Lycoorgus, from Λυκὸς and ἔργον or its root, has all the"
11253,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,appearance of being characteristically Pelasgian.
11254,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11255,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Let us now inquire if the rules laid down will bear the test of being
11256,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,applied to the lower order of the Greek soldiery.
11257,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11258,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,In the Fifth Iliad Hector and Mars slay a batch of apparently
11259,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"undistinguished persons[555]. They are,"
11260,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11261,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,1. Teuthras.
11262,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,2. Orestes.
11263,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,3. Trechus.
11264,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,4. Œnomaus.
11265,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,5. Helenus (son of Œnops).
11266,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,6. Orestius.
11267,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11268,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,And again in the Eleventh Iliad Hector slays nine more;
11269,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11270,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,1. Asæus.
11271,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,2. Autonous.
11272,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,3. Opites.
11273,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,4. Dolops (son of Clytus).
11274,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,5. Opheltius.
11275,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,6. Agelaus.
11276,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,7. Æsymnus.
11277,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,8. Orus.
11278,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,9. Hipponous.
11279,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11280,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Now out of the seventeen names here assembled,"
11281,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11282,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Four, namely, Autonous, Clytus, Agelaus, and Æsymnus (from its"
11283,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"connection with the word αἰσυμνητὴς, ruler), belong to what I term the"
11284,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Hellic class.
11285,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11286,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Three, namely, Teuthras, Asæus, and Helenus, do not immediately suggest"
11287,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,a particular derivation.
11288,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11289,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Of Hipponous I have already spoken. The other nine appear to conform to
11290,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the Pelasgian type. Œnomaus corresponds with the Latin Bibulus.
11291,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11292,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Again; the names of ordinary Trojans appear to belong generally to the
11293,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,same type.
11294,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11295,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"When Patroclus commences his exploits in the Sixteenth book, he slays"
11296,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"in succession,"
11297,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11298,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,1. Pronous.
11299,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"2. Thestor, son of"
11300,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,3. Enops.
11301,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,4. Erualus.
11302,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,5. Erumas.
11303,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,6. Amphoteros.
11304,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,7. Epaltes.
11305,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"8. Tlepolemus, son of"
11306,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,9. Damastor.
11307,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,10. Echios.
11308,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,11. Puris.
11309,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,12. Ipheus.
11310,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"13. Euippus, and"
11311,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"14. Polumelus, son of"
11312,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,15. Argeas.
11313,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11314,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Of these only Tlepolemus and Pronous can with certainty be assigned
11315,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"to the higher class. Damastor is doubtful, like Dmetor; but perhaps"
11316,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"from its connection with Tlepolemus, we ought to place it in the same"
11317,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,category. Still it must be observed that Homer takes care to bring into
11318,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"action against Patroclus and the Myrmidons his favourites the Lycians,"
11319,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,as well as the Trojans[556]: and that therefore we are to presume in
11320,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,this list an intermixture of Lycian names.
11321,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11322,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,The names of ordinary Trojans are for the most part of the same colour.
11323,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,But we must bear in mind that we cannot so easily trace the Trojan as
11324,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the Greek commonalty. Homer rarely allows a Greek of high station or
11325,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,distinction to be slain: whereas the Greeks continually destroy Trojans
11326,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,of eminence. We may therefore be prepared to find names of the higher
11327,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,type somewhat more freely sprinkled among the Trojan than among the
11328,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Greek slain.
11329,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11330,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,In the Sixth Iliad[557] a number of the Greek heroes dispatch
11331,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"consecutively a list of Trojans, which supplies the following names:"
11332,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11333,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,1. Dresus.
11334,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,2. Opheltius.
11335,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"{ These two were sons of Boucolion,"
11336,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"{ an illegitimate son of Laomedon,"
11337,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"3. Æsepus      { who apparently never was acknowledged,"
11338,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,{ but was brought up in the
11339,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,4. Pedasus     { lower class by his mother Abarbaree.
11340,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,{ I add these names to the list:
11341,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,5. Boucolion.
11342,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,6. Abarbaree (mother of Boucolion).

11351,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11352,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Among all these names there is not one which we can with confidence
11353,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"place in the higher category except Aretaon. Dresus (compare δρήστηρ,"
11354,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"a domestic servant), Opheltius, Boucolion, Melanthius (from its use in"
11355,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the Odyssey, supported by Melantho, and both belonging to servants),"
11356,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,are unequivocally of the Pelasgian class: probably Elatus (which
11357,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"however is found among the Ithacan suitors), Phylacus, Adrestus, should"
11358,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"be similarly interpreted. Astualos (ἄστυ, ἃλς) has no contrary force:"
11359,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and of the rest the derivation is not obvious.
11360,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11361,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"If we take the second batch of Trojans slain by Patroclus, it gives a"

11373,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11374,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Of these Autonous and Epistor would seem clearly to belong to the
11375,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"higher class; to which we may add Echeclus, if it is derived (like"
11376,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Echecles, a Myrmidon chieftain) from ἔχω and κλέος: but even this is"
11377,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,not a large proportion.

11379,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Now when we turn to the Lycians[559] slain consecutively by Ulysses, we"

11392,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,All of these seven visibly belong to the higher or Hellenic order of
11393,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"names, except Χρόμιος, which I presume may be akin to χρῶμα, and Ἅλιος,"
11394,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,‘mariner.’ But this last named designation is also somewhat Hellic: I
11395,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,doubt if we find among Pelasgian names any taken from maritime ideas or

11398,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Again, when Achilles comes forth, there is provided for him a list of"

11417,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11418,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Now of these fifteen names none, if judged by the rules which we have"
11419,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"laid down, would clearly fall into the Pelasgian, or more plebeian,"
11420,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"class, except Dryops, perhaps Laogonus, and Bias: three only. Peiroos"
11421,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and Rigmos (probably akin to ῥῖγος) are Thracian, and may be put aside."
11422,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Six, viz., Demuchus, Philetor, Alastor (contrast with this Lethus),"
11423,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Echeclus, Agenor, and Areithous, are of the Hellic class. The others,"
11424,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Dardanus, Tros, Moulius (Il. xi. 739), and Deucalion are repeated from"
11425,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,eminent historical personages.
11426,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11427,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"In this set of names we observe, in conjunction with a new instance"
11428,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of Homer’s ever wakeful care in doing supreme honour to Achilles,"
11429,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"unequivocal evidence, as I think, that the poet did distribute his"
11430,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"names with some special meaning among his minor, and, (so we must"
11431,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"suppose,) generally or frequently, non-historical personages."
11432,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11433,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,And the further inference may perhaps be drawn of a probable affinity
11434,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,of race between the highest Trojans and the Hellic tribes.
11435,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11436,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,This inference may be supported by another example. The numerous sons
11437,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of Antenor, whose names are collected from different parts of the poem,"
11438,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,are as follows:
11439,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11440,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"1. Agenor, Il. xi. 59."
11441,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"2. Acamas, ii. 823. xi. 60. xii. 100, _et alibi_."

11448,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"9. Laodamas, xv. 516."
11449,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"10. Laodocus, iv. 87. and"
11450,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"11. Pedæus (νόθος), v. 70."
11451,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11452,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"I apprehend Laodocus should be construed, after the manner of"
11453,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Demodocus, to signify having fame or repute among the λαός. If so, then"
11454,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of the ten legitimate sons, eight have names with an etymology that"
11455,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,directly connects them with the higher signification. The name of the
11456,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Bastard only is more doubtful.
11457,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11458,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Among the Suitors in Ithaca, who are the princes and chief men of the"
11459,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"island, with their connections, and others of the same class, we have"
11460,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the following list of names of the high class:
11461,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11462,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Mentor.
11463,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Elatus. (cf. Il. xi. 701.)
11464,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Euryades.
11465,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Eurydamas.
11466,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Eurymachus.
11467,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Eurynomus.
11468,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Amphinomus.
11469,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Peisander.
11470,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Eupeithes.
11471,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Antinous.
11472,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Leiocritus.
11473,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Leiodes.
11474,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Agelaus.
11475,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Damastor.
11476,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Demoptolemus.
11477,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Euryades.
11478,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Mastor.
11479,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Euenor.
11480,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Phronius.
11481,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Noemon.
11482,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11483,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Nor are the names which have not been placed in this list of an
11484,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,opposite character. They are chiefly such as have not an obvious
11485,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"etymology. Two of them, Ægyptius and Polybus, were, as we know, great"
11486,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"names in Egypt, and they probably indicate a Pelasgian or an Egyptian"
11487,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"extraction. Others are, Halitherses, Melaneus, Ctesippus, Nisus,"
11488,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Antiphus, Peiræus. Of these, the two, or even the three, first may"
11489,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,perhaps be regarded as properly Hellic.
11490,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11491,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Take again the six sons of Nestor:
11492,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11493,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,1. Antilochus.
11494,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,2. Stratius.
11495,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,3. Thrasymedes.
11496,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,4. Echephron.
11497,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,5. Perseus.
11498,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"6. Aretus (akin to ἀρέσκω, ἀρετή, and the Arete of Scheria)."
11499,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11500,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Of these only Perseus would not at once fall within the class; and this
11501,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"is evidently a most noble name, taken from a great Greek hero. Indeed"
11502,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"it must itself stand as a conspicuous example of the rule, if we shall"
11503,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,hereafter be able to show[561] a relationship between the Hellic races
11504,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and Persia as their fountain-head.
11505,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11506,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Lastly, let us take the Myrmidon leaders and commanders. These were,"
11507,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11508,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,1. Patroclus; { and after him the heads of the five
11509,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,son of   { divisions.
11510,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,2. Menœtius.
11511,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,3. Menesthius.
11512,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,4. Eudorus.
11513,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"5. Peisander, son of"
11514,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"6. Maimalus, from μαιμάω."
11515,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"7. Phœnix. This name may represent, (1) Phœnician"
11516,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,extraction or connection; (2) The palm
11517,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"tree; (3) The colour of red or purple, akin to"
11518,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"φόνος, and to blood, which the colour φοίνιξ is"
11519,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,supposed to betoken. In any of these three
11520,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"aspects, it will fall into the Hellic class."
11521,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"8. Alcimedon, son of Laerces."
11522,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,9. Automedon.
11523,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11524,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,All these names belong to the higher categories. It is therefore the
11525,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"general result of our inquiry, that wherever we have reason on other"
11526,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"grounds to presume a Pelasgian origin, we find in the proper names of"
11527,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"persons, unless they chance to be merely descriptive of the country"
11528,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"they inhabited, a decided tendency to represent peaceful, profitable,"
11529,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and laborious pursuits, or the lower qualities and conditions of"
11530,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,mankind. But wherever from other causes we are entitled to presume an
11531,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Hellic relationship, there, so far as a simple etymology will carry"
11532,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"us, the personal appellatives appear to run upon ideas derived from"
11533,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"intellect, power, command, policy, fame, the great qualities and"
11534,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"achievements of war; in short, apart from religion, which does not"
11535,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"appear to enter into the composition of nomenclature at all, all the"
11536,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,ideas that appeal most strongly to those masculine faculties of our
11537,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"race, in which its perfection was so vividly conceived by the Greeks to"
11538,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,reside.
11539,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11540,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,_Evidence from political and martial ideas._
11541,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11542,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"One among the most remarkable features of the Homeric Poems is, their"
11543,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,highly forward development of political ideas in a very early stage
11544,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,of society[562]. It seems hardly necessary to argue that these were
11545,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of Hellic origin; because the fact is before us, that they make their"
11546,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,appearance in Homer simultaneously with the universal ascendancy of the
11547,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Hellic over the Pelasgian tribes wherever they were in contact; and
11548,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"because, in comparing the two nations together, we shall have occasion"
11549,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"to note the greater backwardness, and indocility, so to speak, of the"
11550,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Trojans[563] in this respect. I assume, therefore, without detailed"
11551,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"argument, the peculiar relation between the Hellic stock and the"
11552,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,political institutions of Greece.
11553,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11554,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,For similar reasons I shall touch very briefly the relation of the
11555,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Hellic tribes to the martial character of Greece.
11556,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11557,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"We may consider the whole Iliad, which represents a conflict between"
11558,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"less Pelasgic and more Pelasgic races, and which gives a clear"
11559,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"superiority to the former, as a general but decisive testimony to this"
11560,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,fact.
11561,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11562,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"We find another such testimony, with a well established historical"
11563,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"character, in the comparison between the secondary military position"
11564,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of Athens in the Iliad, and its splendid distinctions in later"
11565,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"times. It is true indeed, that the Athenian troops are mentioned"
11566,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"specifically in the attack upon the ships, together with the Bœotians,"
11567,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Locrians, Phthians, and Epeans[564]. Of these the two latter are"
11568,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,called respectively μεγάθυμοι and φαιδιμόεντες; the Athenians are the
11569,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Ἰάονες ἑλκεχίτωνες, an epithet of most doubtful character as applied"
11570,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,to soldiers. It seems to me plain that Homer by no means meant the
11571,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,particular notice of these five divisions for a mark of honour: they
11572,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"fought to be defeated, and he does not use his prime Greeks in that"
11573,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,manner. No Peloponnesian forces are named as having been engaged on
11574,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,this occasion. Those probably were the flower of the army; and it
11575,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,is mentioned in the Catalogue that the troops of Agamemnon were the
11576,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"best[565]. Again, it will be seen, on reference to the Catalogue,"
11577,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,that the whole force of Middle Greece is here in battle except the
11578,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Ætolians, the contingent of Ulysses, and the Abantes (for whom see"
11579,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"542-4). These three are all distinguished races, whom he seems"
11580,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"purposely to have excluded from a contest, where honour was not to be"
11581,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"gained. The military contrast, then, between the earlier and the later"
11582,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Athens, may be taken to be established: and with it coincides that"
11583,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"very marked, though normal and pacific, transition of Attica from the"
11584,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,exclusively Pelasgic to the fullest development of the composite Greek
11585,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,character[566].
11586,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11587,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The passage of the seventh Iliad, which describes the war of the"
11588,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Pylians with the Arcadians, suggests a like conclusion."
11589,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11590,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Upon the whole, however, the _de facto_ Hellic ascendancy in Greece at"
11591,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the time is, with reference to war and the strong hand even more than"
11592,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"to policy, a full presumption of their title to be regarded as having"
11593,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,given birth to the splendid military genius of Greece.
11594,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11595,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"When, for the business of the Trojan war, Homer divides the two great"
11596,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"traditive deities[567], and assigns to the Greeks Pallas, the more"
11597,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"political, energetic, and intellectual of the two, to the Trojans"
11598,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Apollo, we may take this as of itself involving an assertion, that the"
11599,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,high arts of policy and war were peculiarly Hellenic.
11600,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11601,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,_Evidence from Games._
11602,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11603,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"We come now to the principle of what may be called corporal education,"
11604,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,which found a development among the Greeks more fully than among any
11605,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"other nation; first, in gymnastic exercises, generally pursued, and,"
11606,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"secondly, in the great national institution of the Games."
11607,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11608,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"“There were,” says Grote[568], “two great holding points in common for"
11609,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"every section of Greeks. One was the Amphictyonic Assembly, which met"
11610,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"half yearly, alternately at Delphi and at Thermopylae; originally and"
11611,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"chiefly for common religious purposes, but indirectly and occasionally"
11612,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,embracing political and social objects along with them. The other
11613,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"was, the public festivals or games, of which the Olympic came first"
11614,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"in importance; next, the Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian: institutions,"
11615,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,which combined religious solemnities with recreative effusion and
11616,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"hearty sympathies, in a manner so imposing and so unparalleled."
11617,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Amphictyon represents the first of these institutions, and Aethlius the"
11618,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,second.”
11619,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11620,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,This passage places in an extremely clear light the relative position
11621,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,of the Games and the Amphictyonic Assembly. The Council represented
11622,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"a religious institution, partaking also of a political character. The"
11623,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Games, on the other hand, were a gymnastic celebration, made available"
11624,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"for national gatherings: placed, as a matter of prime public moment,"
11625,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"under the guardianship of high religious solemnities, and referred for"
11626,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"greater effect, in the later tradition, to some person of the highest"
11627,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"rank and extraction, as their nominal founder. As the objects of the"
11628,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Games and the Council were distinct, so were their origin and history"
11629,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,different; and this difference mounted up into the very earliest
11630,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,ages. This is clearly proved by the extra-historic and mythical names
11631,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"assigned to their founders, whose faint personality does not even"
11632,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"serve to repress the suggestion of fiction, conveyed with irresistible"
11633,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"force by etymological considerations. But the legend, though a legend"
11634,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"only, conformed to the laws of probability, by assigning to Amphictyon"
11635,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"a Thessalian birth, and by vindicating at the same time to Aethlius"
11636,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the higher honour of the immediate paternity of Jupiter; while, by"
11637,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,placing him in Elis it secures his function as the institutor of the
11638,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"oldest, namely, the Olympic Games. In this legend, too, we see Hellenic"
11639,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"imagination providing for its own ancestral honours in competition,"
11640,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"as it were, with those of the sister institution, which may have been"
11641,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Pelasgian.
11642,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11643,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The foundation of Games _in genere_ appears to be traceable, with"
11644,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"sufficient clearness and upon Homeric evidence, to the Hellic tribes."
11645,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11646,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,The lengthened detail of the Twenty-third Iliad is of itself enough
11647,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"to prove their importance, as an institution founded in the national"
11648,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"habits and manners. We must not, however, rely upon the absence of any"
11649,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"similar celebrations, or even allusions to them, among the Trojans;"
11650,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"since their condition, in the circumstances of the war, will of itself"
11651,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,account for it. But we may observe how closely it belonged to the
11652,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,character of the greatest heroes to excel in every feat of gymnastic
11653,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"strength, as well as in the exercises of actual warfare. The kings"
11654,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and leading chiefs all act in the Games, with the qualified exception"
11655,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of Agamemnon, whose dignity could not allow him to be actually judged"
11656,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"by his inferiors, but yet who appears as a nominal candidate, and"
11657,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"receives the compliment of a prize, though spared the contest for it;"
11658,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and with the exception also of Achilles, who could not contend for his"
11659,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"own prizes. Again, it is a piece of evidence in favour of the Hellic"
11660,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"character of public Games, that, though there were three Athenian"
11661,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"leaders alive during the action of the Twenty-third Book, none of them"
11662,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"took any part. They were Menestheus, Pheidas, and Bias. Again, the"
11663,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"speech of Ulysses to Euryalus, the saucy Phæacian[569], with the acts"
11664,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"which followed it, strengthen the general testimony of the Iliad upon"
11665,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the point. So does the prosecution of these exercises, to the best of"
11666,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"their power, even by the Phæacians, the kindred of the gods."
11667,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11668,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"So much for the general idea of Games in Homer; but, to draw the"
11669,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"distinction with any force between what is Hellic and what is Pelasgic,"
11670,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,we must refer to those passages which afford glimpses of the earlier
11671,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"state of Greece, and see what light they afford us."
11672,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11673,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"According to the Homeric text, Elis and Corinth were the portions of"
11674,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the Peloponnesus, where the early notes of the presence of the Hellenic"
11675,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,races are most evident. Now of these Elis had the greatest and oldest
11676,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Greek Games, while the Isthmian festival at Corinth was held to stand"
11677,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,next to them.
11678,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11679,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,The invention of these gymnastic exercises was ascribed in the later
11680,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"mythology to Mercury, who is in Homer a Hellenic, as opposed to"
11681,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Pelasgian, deity."
11682,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11683,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Mercurî, facunde nepos Atlantis,"
11684,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Qui feros mores hominum recentum
11685,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Voce formasti catus, et decoræ"
11686,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,More palæstræ[570].
11687,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11688,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"It has been observed, that the Hermes of Homer bears no trace of this"
11689,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,function: but we have no proof in Homer of the formal institution of
11690,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Games at all, although we have clear signs of them as a known and"
11691,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,familiar practice; and the Mercury of the poems is even yet more
11692,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Phœnician than he is Hellenic. Aristophanes[571] produces the Ἑρμῆς
11693,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Ἐναγώνιος, and supplies a fresh link of connection by referring to"
11694,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"ἀγῶνες in music, as well as in feats of corporal strength and skill. So"
11695,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,does Pindar[572].
11696,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11697,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"In truth, these Games were the exercise and pleasure of the highest"
11698,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"orders only. For we see that, in Homer’s Twenty-third Book, not a"
11699,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,single person takes a part in any of the eight matches that is not
11700,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"actually named among the ἡγεμόνες and κοίρανοι of the Catalogue, with"
11701,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"three such exceptions as really confirm the rule. They are Antilochus,"
11702,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the heir apparent of Pylos, Teucer the brother of Ajax, and Epeus,"
11703,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"(only however in the boxing match,) who appears from the Odyssey[573]"
11704,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"to have been a person of importance, as he contrived the stratagem of"
11705,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the horse. Even the σόλος αὐτοχόωνος, the iron lump, part of the booty"
11706,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of Achilles, had formerly been used for the sport only of a king[574]."
11707,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11708,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,ὃν πρὶν μὲν ῥίπτασκε μέγα σθένος Ἠετίωνος.
11709,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11710,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The Greek Games presuppose leisure, and therefore the accumulation of"
11711,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"property, or the concentrated possession of lands: but this comports"
11712,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"much more with Hellenic than with what we know of Pelasgic society, in"
11713,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"which we do not find the same signs as in the former, of an aristocracy"
11714,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"occupying the middle place between the people at large, and the royal"
11715,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,house. Let us now examine another part of the Homeric evidence.
11716,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11717,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"In the Eleventh Iliad, Nestor’s legend acquaints us that, at the time"
11718,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of the war between Pylians and Elians, Neleus the king appropriated a"
11719,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"part of the Pylian spoil, in respect of a ‘debt’ owed him in Elis, the"
11720,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,nature of which he explains[575]:
11721,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11722,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"τέσσαρες ἀθλοφόροι ἵπποι αὐτοῖσιν ὄχεσφιν,"
11723,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,ἐλθόντες μετ’ ἄεθλα· περὶ τρίποδος γὰρ ἔμελλον
11724,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,θεύσεσθαι· τοὺς δ’ αὖθι ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Αὐγείας
11725,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"κάσχεθε, τὸν δ’ ἐλατῆρ’ ἀφίει, ἀκαχήμενον ἵππων."
11726,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11727,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"There were then, it is plain, chariot races regularly established"
11728,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"(for the Games are here spoken of without explanation, as a matter"
11729,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,familiarly known) in Olympia: and this was during the boyhood of
11730,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Nestor, or about two generations before the Trojan war. The tribes,"
11731,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"which we here see concerned in these Games, are first, the Pylians,"
11732,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and next the Elians, of whom Augeas was king. It will be seen in a"
11733,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"subsequent part of this inquiry[576], that both of these tribes were"
11734,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Hellic, and not Pelasgian. Yet certainly there is nothing here to show"
11735,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,directly the non-participation of Pelasgians in the games.
11736,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11737,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,There is however another passage of our useful friend Nestor in the
11738,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Twenty-third Book, which supplies in some degree even this form of"
11739,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"evidence. ‘Would,’ says he in his usual phrase, ‘would I were young and"
11740,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"strong[577],’"
11741,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11742,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,ὡς ὅποτε κρείοντ’ Ἀμαρυγκέα θάπτον Ἐπειοὶ
11743,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Βουπρασίῳ, παῖδες δ’ ἔθεσαν βασιλῆος ἄεθλα·"
11744,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11745,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Here is a distinct testimony to the custom of funeral Games in Elis,"
11746,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"nearly two generations before the _Troica_. They embraced, as we find"
11747,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"further down in the record, 1. Chariot races, with the best prize; 2."
11748,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Boxing; 3. Wrestling; 4. Running; and 5. Hurling the spear. But we have
11749,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"a further most valuable passage. There was no person present, says"
11750,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Nestor, equal to myself; and then he adds an exhaustive enumeration of"
11751,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the races that furnished the company:
11752,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11753,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"οὔτ’ ἄρ’ Ἐπεῶν,"
11754,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"οὔτ’ αὐτῶν Πυλίων, οὔτ’ Αἰτώλων μεγαθύμων."
11755,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11756,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"For the Epeans (or Elians) and Pylians, I repeat the reference already"
11757,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"made. Nor can I doubt that the Ætolians, the subjects of Œneus and"
11758,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"his illustrious family, belonged to the same stock. I do not inquire"
11759,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"whether, as they were always in later times held to belong to the"
11760,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Æolian branch of the Greeks, so their name may have been radically akin"
11761,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"to, or identical with, the name of Æolus, which is often with Homer"
11762,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Αἴωλος. But we find Meleager (independently of the reference to him,"
11763,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"evidently as a great national hero, in the Catalogue[578],) selected"
11764,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"by Phœnix for the subject of an episode of great length, and held out"
11765,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,as a warning and example to Achilles[579]. It may safely be assumed
11766,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"he would have chosen no character for this purpose, except that of an"
11767,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"hero of pure Hellic origin. And the description of Tydeus, the father"
11768,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of Diomed, by the epithet Αἰτώλιος[580], again serves to identify the"
11769,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Ætolian name with the Hellic races.
11770,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11771,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The tribes present, then, at the Games were all Hellic, and they were"
11772,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"all conterminous: the Epean inhabitants, the Pylians, neighbours on the"
11773,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"South, the Ætolians from the other side of the narrow strait, which"
11774,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"was the most frequented passage into Peloponnesus. In fact, it was"
11775,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,evidently an assemblage of the neighbouring tribes; but with a most
11776,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"remarkable exception, that of the eastern neighbours of Elis, those"
11777,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"same Arcadians, whom by many signs we are enabled to conclude to have"
11778,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,been Pelasgian.
11779,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11780,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"A third instance in which Homer notices gymnastic exercises, is in"
11781,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Il. iv. 389. Here Tydeus, having gone to Thebes, finds a solemn"
11782,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"banquet proceeding in the palace of Eteocles. Alone among many, and on"
11783,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"questionable terms with his hosts, he nevertheless at once challenges"
11784,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"them to gymnastic games, and beats them all."
11785,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11786,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"ἀλλ’ ὅγ’ ἀεθλεύειν προκαλίζετο, πάντα δ’ ἐνίκα"
11787,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,ῥηιδίως· τοίη οἱ ἐπιρρόθος ἦεν Ἀθήνη.
11788,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11789,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Achæan, that is Hellene, himself, he is, if not among Hellenes, yet"
11790,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,among the members and adherents of that Phœnician dynasty which had
11791,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"established itself, to all appearance, in Bœotia, at a somewhat early"
11792,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"date: even as, at a period slightly later[581], Minos established from"
11793,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Phœnicia a Throne in Crete, which soon became wholly Greek in character."
11794,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11795,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"And again, in Il. xxiii. 678-80, we are told, that Mecisteus, on the"
11796,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"death of Œdipus, went to Thebes to the even then customary funeral"
11797,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Games, and there was victor over all the Καδμείωνες who opposed him, by"
11798,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the aid of Minerva. Euryalus, the son of Mecisteus, was an Argive, and"
11799,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,was the colleague of Diomed and Sthenelus. The same observations are
11800,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"applicable here, as in the last case."
11801,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11802,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,There is therefore nothing in any one of these cases to connect the
11803,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"gymnastic celebrations with the Pelasgian, but every thing to associate"
11804,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,them with the Hellic races.
11805,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11806,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Of the Greek Games, the Pythian are those which, as being under"
11807,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Apollo, might most be suspected of Pelasgic origin. But these did"
11808,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,not apparently begin as a national gymnastic festival until about 586
11809,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,B. C.[582] The Olympic contests had then been regularly recorded for
11810,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"nearly two hundred years, since 776 B. C. And in the laws of Solon"
11811,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,there was a reward of 500 drachms for every Athenian who should gain
11812,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"an Olympic prize, of 100 only for an Isthmian: while of the Nemean and"
11813,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Pythian Games, as being merely local, they take no notice. So these"
11814,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Games, besides being secondary, belonged to times much later, and also"
11815,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,purely Hellenic.
11816,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11817,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,The Panathenaic Games are apparently of similar date. And with this
11818,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"evidence from the earlier historic times before us, no importance can"
11819,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"attach to a tradition so late as that of Pausanias, who makes Theseus"
11820,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"found the Panathenaica, and Lycaon, son of Pelasgus, the Λύκαια[583]."
11821,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"But it is well worthy of remark, that in reporting this tradition he"
11822,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"adds, that the Olympic Games were much older, that they mounted to"
11823,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the very highest antiquity of the human race, and that Κρόνος and"
11824,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Jupiter were said to have contended at them for prizes. Again, great"
11825,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,fame attached to the Games said to have been celebrated by Acastus on
11826,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the death of his father Pelias. Stesichorus, who lived in the seventh"
11827,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"century, wrote a poem upon them; but Pelias, the brother of Neleus, and"
11828,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"son of Tyro, (having Neptune for his father,) was of undoubted Hellic"
11829,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,origin[584].
11830,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11831,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Minor instances of the addiction of the Hellic races to Games may be
11832,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"found in the constant practice of the Ithacan Suitors, and in the"
11833,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"resort of the Myrmidons before Troy, during the seclusion of Achilles,"
11834,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,to this method of beguiling their time[585].
11835,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11836,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,The case stands only a little less distinctly as to song. There is an
11837,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"ἀοιδὸς in the palace of Priam, as well as in that of Ulysses; one in"
11838,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"that of Agamemnon, and one in that of Alcinous. The Muses are Olympian"
11839,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Muses. Olympus geographically was quite as much Hellic as Pelasgian,"
11840,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and in every other sense, as I believe, far more. We may perhaps most"
11841,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"fairly estimate its national character, by contrasting the Jupiter"
11842,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of Olympus with the Jupiter of Dodona, and the home of the large and"
11843,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,varied group of Grecian gods with the solitary grandeur which affords a
11844,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,trace of the old Pelasgian worship. In this view Olympus and the Muses
11845,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"will be clearly Hellic. Further[586], Thamyris in his boast supposes"
11846,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the Muses to be contending against him at the public matches. If I have
11847,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"been correct in tracing such matches to an Hellic source, Thamyris must"
11848,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"have regarded the Muses as Hellic when he made this supposition. Again,"
11849,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Thamyris himself is a Θρὴξ, that is to say, a highlander: this connects"
11850,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"him with the Helli of the hills, not with the Pelasgians of the more"
11851,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"open country. The place, too, where the punishment is inflicted upon"
11852,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Thamyris, is in the dominions of Pylus: which, at any rate for a term"
11853,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"equal to three generations before the _Troica_, had been Achæan, that"
11854,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"is, Hellic[587]."
11855,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11856,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Apollo was doubtless an object of Pelasgian worship: the Apollo of
11857,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Homer however is not confined to the Pelasgians, but is by many signs,"
11858,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"scattered throughout the poems, placed in close as well as friendly"
11859,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,relations with the whole Greek nation. Among these may be reckoned his
11860,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"acceptance of the propitiation and prayer offered by Calchas. In truth,"
11861,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"though it is his business, as the organ of Jupiter, to assist the"
11862,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Trojans, he no where shows any of that hostility to their opponents,"
11863,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,which Neptune and Juno show to them.
11864,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11865,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,_As to poetry and music._
11866,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11867,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"In later times, the traditions of Orpheus, Musæus, and Eumolpus, always"
11868,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Θρῇκες, supported the tradition which derives Greek song from the"
11869,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,mountain tribes.
11870,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11871,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Why has Arcadia a muse of her own, but because the Pelasgian poetry is"
11872,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,not the Hellic? and does not the reputed character of that muse oblige
11873,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,us to assign a Hellic origin to the higher national poetry?
11874,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11875,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Hesiod, as author of the Works and Days, is so enormously different"
11876,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"from Homer in his frame of mind, as well as his diction, that it is"
11877,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"hard to trace, even in the most general form, a complete national"
11878,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"affinity between them. The Theogony, by its subject, brought him nearer"
11879,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"to Homer, but it is quite destitute of the heroic power and fire: a"
11880,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"calm and low-toned beauty, as in the legend of the Ages, is all to"
11881,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"which Hesiod ever rises. To my conjecture, he seems to personify the"
11882,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,one-stringed instrument which might suffice for Pelasgian song: while
11883,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the Diapason of Homer, embracing with its immeasurable sweep things"
11884,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"small and things great, things sublime and things homely, all objects"
11885,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"that human experience had suggested, and all thoughts that the soul of"
11886,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"man had imagined or received, presents to us that Greek mind, full,"
11887,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"varied, energetic, lively, profound, exact, which was destined to give"
11888,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,form for so many ages to the genius of the world.
11889,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11890,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"I cannot however part from this subject, and leave the Hellenic races"
11891,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,in possession of the honour of having principally contributed to
11892,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"mould the powerful imagination of the Greeks, without noticing the"
11893,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"opposite conclusion of Mr. Fergusson, in his admirable ‘Handbook of"
11894,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Architecture.’
11895,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11896,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"He treats the Greek nation as made up chiefly of two ingredients, the"
11897,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Dorian and the Pelasgian. He takes the Greeks of the Trojan Epoch to
11898,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"have been Pelasgian, and so to have continued until the return of the"
11899,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Heraclidæ. Then, according to him, began the Hellenic, which he treats"
11900,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"as synonymous with the Doric, preponderance; and, having Sparta before"
11901,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"him as the one great Hellic type, he observes that the race was far"
11902,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"better adapted “for the arts of war and self-government, than for the"
11903,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,softer arts of poetry and peace[588].”
11904,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11905,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"But the supposition of a Pelasgic supremacy in Homeric Greece, is"
11906,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"contrary to all the evidence afforded by the text of Homer, and, I"
11907,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"think we may add, to the belief alike of ancient and of modern times."
11908,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Even the limited part of the Homeric evidence which is connected with
11909,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the names Ἕλλας and Ἕλληνες, seems large enough to overthrow any such"
11910,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"hypothesis. Though the Dorian race was Hellenic, it was apparently"
11911,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"a late outgrowth from the stock, and has no pretension whatever to"
11912,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"be considered as the universal type of its products. In Sparta, the"
11913,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,excessive development of policy was doubtless unfavourable to human
11914,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"excellence in other forms; among others, to poetry and art. Still,"
11915,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"neither verse, music, nor architecture are disconnected from the Dorian"
11916,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,name and race. It seems quite impossible to refer the war-poetry of
11917,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the Iliad, the grandest in the world, for its origin to a people so"
11918,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"unwarlike, in reference especially to the changeful, romantic, and"
11919,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"poetic side of war, as the Pelasgi."
11920,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11921,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The adventurous tone and tenour of the Odyssey, and its wide range over"
11922,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the world, and over the sea, are as little in keeping with what we can"
11923,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"see of Pelasgic habits in the heroic age. Above all, that largeness and"
11924,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"unimpaired universality of type, which belongs to human character as"
11925,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"drawn by Homer, and especially to Achilles and Ulysses, demonstrate (I"
11926,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,cannot use a weaker word) that all the materials of Grecian greatness
11927,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,were in his time fully ripened.
11928,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11929,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,_Pelasgian sense of beauty._
11930,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11931,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"At the same time it is not necessary to deny, that the Pelasgians"
11932,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,may have been endowed with a high sense of beauty. Not that Homer
11933,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,appears to have had a vivid conception of beauty in connection with
11934,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"architecture, their great reputed accomplishment; for he seems, on the"
11935,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"contrary, to have had little idea of ornament in buildings, beyond"
11936,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the blaze of plates of polished metal: far different here from what
11937,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"he shows himself to be in dealing with dress, or armour, or the forms"
11938,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,of men and horses. But we have before us the fact that through Athens
11939,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"itself preeminently, and likewise through its colonies to the east, the"
11940,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Greek race earned in after-times the very highest honours in poetry
11941,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and the fine arts. On the one hand, however, a large share of these"
11942,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"honours, especially in early times, fell to the share of the race"
11943,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"called Æolian, which was clearly Hellic, and a principal part of the"
11944,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Hellic family. On the other hand, Arcadia, which remained more purely"
11945,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Pelasgian, while Athens received all sorts of mixtures, never attained"
11946,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"to high distinction in art, nor rose above a modest and tranquil strain"
11947,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,of verse. The great tragedians and the great artists were of a race
11948,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the most composite in all Greece. The natural inference would seem to
11949,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"be, that whatever the Pelasgians may have contributed to the general"
11950,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"result, however they may have afforded for poetry and art (as also they"
11951,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"did for war) a good raw material, it was only when in combination with"
11952,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"other elements from other sources, that they could attain to great"
11953,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"practical excellence. A lively sense of beauty is, doubtless, not only"
11954,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"a condition, but even a foundation: yet a great organising power is as"
11955,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"necessary for the production of the great works of imagination, as"
11956,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"it was to Lycurgus for the Spartan constitution, or to Aristotle for"
11957,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,philosophical analysis and construction; and this was the commanding
11958,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and sovereign faculty in a mind such as that of Homer.
11959,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11960,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,The connection between the Homeric Greeks and the traditions of
11961,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"huntsmen is, I think, sufficiently evident from Homer. His hunting"
11962,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"legends, and the multitude of his hunting similes, are so many signs of"
11963,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"it; and many indications, I think, concur towards forming a belief that"
11964,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the Greeks owed their fondness for the chace to their Hellic, not to"
11965,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,their Pelasgic habits and blood.
11966,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11967,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,I take first the relation between Achilles and his instructors.
11968,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Chiron was the teacher of Achilles in the surgical art, while Phœnix"
11969,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,had charge of his higher education. Surgery and war would obviously
11970,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,go together. But Chiron too gave his father the ashen spear from
11971,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Pelion, which none but Achilles could wield: he was the most civilized"
11972,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"(δικαιότατος) of the Centaurs, the one to whom the ideas of right, on"
11973,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"which society is founded, were most congenial. But he seems to dwell"
11974,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"on Mount Pelion, not like Phœnix, in the court of Peleus; he is,"
11975,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"therefore, without doubt, a huntsman, and is in fact a link between the"
11976,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"old and rude, and the new and more civilized life of the Hellic tribes."
11977,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11978,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Again. Of the Hellic legends of Homer, which are not in all very"
11979,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"numerous, two have hunting for their subject: as,"
11980,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11981,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,1. That of the Calydonian Boar in Il. ix.
11982,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11983,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"2. That of the visit of Ulysses to the court of Autolycus, in Od. xix."
11984,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11985,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Now these two legends are the only ones in the poems, that do not"
11986,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"relate to war. Though the Trojans dwelt by Ida, we never hear of their"
11987,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"hunts: but their princes feed sheep upon its slopes, or tend horses in"
11988,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the plain below.
11989,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11990,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,_Evidence as to hunting._
11991,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11992,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Even apart from particular evidence, we might presume that, if the"
11993,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"nation derived its warlike turn from a Hellic source, so it must"
11994,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"likewise have been with hunting, which was next of kin to war."
11995,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
11996,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Lastly, if this supposition be correct, it helps to account for what"
11997,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,is otherwise an anomaly in the poems. Diana fights on the Trojan side:
11998,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"yet we find no evidence that she was worshipped among the Trojans, or"
11999,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"even known to them in the character, in which she has the greatest"
12000,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"mythical celebrity. She is mentioned but once, I think, among them; it"
12001,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"is by Andromache, and that is as having put a period to her mother’s"
12002,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"life[589], nowhere in her character as a huntress. But among the Greeks"
12003,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,she constantly appears otherwise than as in connection with death. Her
12004,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"epithets, ἀγροτέρη, κελαδεινὴ, ἰοχέαιρα, are far more suitable to the"
12005,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"huntress, than to the more solemn function of the ministry of Death"
12006,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"among human beings. Again, Helen is compared to her in appearance."
12007,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,The calamities of the Kalydonians came upon them in consequence of
12008,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,their neglect as to her worship on a particular occasion[590]; and the
12009,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,particular punishment inflicted is the sending a wild boar upon them.
12010,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Nausicaa[591] is elaborately compared to her, and in this simile she is"
12011,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,described as hunting in Taygetus and Erymanthus. Thus while among the
12012,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"more Pelasgic Trojans, she appears only in virtue of the relation to"
12013,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,death which (we shall find) she holds from a traditive source[592]; it
12014,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"is the Hellic influence, which superadds the mythical and imaginative"
12015,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"attributes of the beautiful huntress: and which, in so doing, supplies"
12016,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,a marked proof of the addiction of the Hellic tribes to that pursuit.
12017,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12018,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,_Evidence as to navigation._
12019,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12020,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,It is not easy to judge whether the turn of the Greeks for navigation
12021,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"ought to be referred in any degree to a Pelasgian source. Plainly, if"
12022,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"there was such a source, it was not the main one. We have seen that"
12023,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"only the most elementary words connected with propulsion by rowing,"
12024,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,appear to bear any sign on them of proceeding from that stock. We
12025,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,cannot argue from the maritime excellence of the Athenians at a much
12026,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"later date to their nautical character in the time of Homer, on account"
12027,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of the important ethnical changes, which in the mean time they had"
12028,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"gradually, but most thoroughly, undergone. On the other hand, our"
12029,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,finding the pure Pelasgian population of Arcadia resorting to the
12030,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"inland country, and wholly destitute of ships, affords a negative"
12031,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"indication. A stronger, and indeed very remarkable one, is supplied by"
12032,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the total want of ships among the Trojans, notwithstanding that their"
12033,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,situation was one highly favourable to the acquisition of maritime
12034,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,power. Yet Paris needed to have ships built for him in order to effect
12035,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"his tour[593], and the building of them appears in the Iliad as"
12036,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"having been an event of much note in Troy. On the other hand, Homer"
12037,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,is full of indications of the locomotive tendencies of the Hellic
12038,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"races. Among these may be mentioned, the wide circle embraced in"
12039,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the adventures of Hercules: the offer of Menelaus[594] to accompany
12040,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Telemachus on a journey about Greece: the sojourn of Neoptolemus[595]
12041,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,in Scyros: the frequent visits of Idomeneus[596] to Sparta before
12042,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the war: the marriage of Theseus[597] to a daughter of the king of
12043,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Crete: the journey of Nestor[598] into Thessaly: the pleasure visits
12044,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of Autolycus to Ithaca, and of the young Ulysses[599] to Autolycus:"
12045,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the evident familiarity of the Poet with the idea of travelling to
12046,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,recover debts[600]: the existence of places of wide resort for Games
12047,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and Oracles[601]: the custom of assembling from a group of districts
12048,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"at the funerals of great men[602]: nay, the very choice of the voyages"
12049,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of Ulysses for the subject of so great a part of the Odyssey, and the"
12050,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,lengthened tour of Menelaus. And while the Pelasgians appear to be akin
12051,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"to the land-loving Egyptians, we have found the Hellenes to be strongly"
12052,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"sympathetic in character with the Phœnicians, the great masters of"
12053,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,navigation in the heroic age.
12054,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12055,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"From the speech of the Pseudo-Ulysses in the Fourteenth Odyssey, we"
12056,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"have the strongest evidence that navigation and agricultural pursuits,"
12057,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"which were those of the Pelasgians, stood in sharp opposition to one"
12058,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"another. He could not bear tillage, but loved ships and war[603]."
12059,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12060,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"ἔργον δέ μοι οὐ φίλον ἦεν,"
12061,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"οὐδ’ οἰκωφελίη, ἥτε τρέφει ἀγλαὰ τέκνα·"
12062,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,ἀλλά μοι αἰεὶ νῆες ἐπήρετμοι φίλοι ἦσαν
12063,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,καὶ πόλεμοι καὶ ἄκοντες ἐΰξεστοι καὶ ὀïστοί.
12064,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12065,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"It is also plain, from two circumstances at least, that Homer regarded"
12066,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"travelling as one great means of mental and practical culture. One is,"
12067,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,that he describes this benefit as attained in the case of his great
12068,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,hero Ulysses;
12069,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12070,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,ὃς μάλα πολλὰ
12071,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,πλάγχθη ...
12072,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"πολλῶν δ’ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα, καὶ νόον ἔγνω[604]."
12073,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12074,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The other is that, in the very remarkable simile of the Thought, he"
12075,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,treats travelling as the great stimulus to the growth of the mind of
12076,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,man:
12077,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12078,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"ὡς δ’ ὅτ’ ἂν ἀΐξῃ νόος ἀνέρος, ὅς τ’ ἐπὶ πολλήν"
12079,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,γαῖαν ἐληλουθὼς φρεσὶ πευκαλίμῃσι νοήσῃ·
12080,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"ἔνθ’ εἴην, ἢ ἔνθα· μενοινήῃσί τε πολλά[605]."
12081,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12082,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Both as to navigation then, and as to locomotion, which stand nearly"
12083,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"related to each other, it would seem that we ought probably to regard"
12084,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the Hellic stock as the parent of the Greek accomplishment.
12085,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12086,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,_Summary of the case._
12087,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12088,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"After this laborious and microscopic investigation, we may now be"
12089,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,justified in taking a survey more at ease of the ground which we have
12090,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"traversed so slowly, and in endeavouring to embody our general results"
12091,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"in a rude sketch of the succession, places, and functions of the two"
12092,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,great races of early Greece.
12093,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12094,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Relying, therefore, upon what has been produced in the way of proof,"
12095,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,I will proceed to fill up its interstices with such conjectures as
12096,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,probable reasoning will supply.
12097,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12098,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The Greek nation was originally formed of two great coefficients, the"
12099,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Hellic and Pelasgic races respectively: and there is no evidence, that"
12100,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"any other race entered largely into its composition, or modified it"
12101,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"sensibly: although individual foreigners or companies of emigrants,"
12102,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"which left little impression on the names of districts or races, may"
12103,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,notwithstanding have exercised a powerful influence from time to time.
12104,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"We may consider the Leleges, Caucones, and other pre-Hellenic tribes as"
12105,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"branches of the Pelasgian family, or as akin to it rather than to the"
12106,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Hellic stem.
12107,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12108,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"There is Homeric and post-Homeric evidence, which seems to shew us the"
12109,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Pelasgians established through Greece from Macedonia in the north,"
12110,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"to Crete in the south: as well as in Italy, and elsewhere beyond the"
12111,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,borders of Greece.
12112,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12113,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"It is on the whole most probable, that the Pelasgians principally"
12114,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,entered Greece from the south by Crete; but they may have entered
12115,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"it in both directions. In either case, there is no other people"
12116,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,to dispute with them in continental Greece the title of its first
12117,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"regular settlers. They chose their habitations in the plains, and"
12118,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,were essentially a lowland people. It is even likely that they derive
12119,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"their name from this characteristic, and that it marks them at once as"
12120,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,agriculturists.
12121,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12122,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"As respects the religion of Greece, its most essential features were"
12123,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,probably common to the two races: a principle illustrated by the fact
12124,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"that the Helli, by a kind of natural succession, become the wardens and"
12125,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,interpreters of the great Pelasgian shrine of Jupiter at Dodona.
12126,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12127,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,The first form of the religion of Greece was probably due to
12128,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the Pelasgians; and moreover it would appear to be from them
12129,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"that it received, in the main, its ritual and hierarchical, as"
12130,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"contradistinguished from its imaginative, development. They appear to"
12131,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"have incorporated it in visible institutions, and to have given social"
12132,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"order to the country; probably in that form in which men live sparsely,"
12133,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and not in the large aggregations of considerable cities. But social
12134,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,order in any form implies some means of defence against the lawless:
12135,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and we must view the Pelasgians as having introduced the construction
12136,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of works of this class, which were then of prime necessity to the"
12137,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,existence of communities. Their standing pursuit was evidently that of
12138,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,agriculture: the only link of connection established by Homer between
12139,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"them and the beautiful in art, is the doubtful one of the epithets"
12140,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,περικαλλέα and καλὰ[606] applied to the architecture of the palaces of
12141,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Priam and Paris respectively.
12142,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12143,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"In general, the Pelasgian race, though without the vivid temperament of"
12144,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the Hellic tribes, yet would appear to have been both brave and solid"
12145,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,in character.
12146,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12147,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The stream of Pelasgic immigration, flowing chiefly northward, is met"
12148,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"by the counter-stream of Hellic tribes, proceeding from the highland"
12149,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"nation of the Helli, which had taken its seat in the mountains to the"
12150,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,north of Thessaly.
12151,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12152,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,They in their southward course overspread the same countries which the
12153,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,Pelasgi had already occupied; successive tribes of immigrants going
12154,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"forth from the parent stock at different times, as the pressure of"
12155,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"population on the means of subsistence required it, and under different"
12156,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"names, taken in all likelihood from their leaders."
12157,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12158,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"In the nest of mountaineers, barbarism, or at least rudeness,"
12159,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"continues: but as the young broods go forth, and make their way into"
12160,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"more favourable conditions of physical and social life, their great"
12161,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"capacities for development find scope, and they rapidly assume a new"
12162,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,character.
12163,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12164,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"By their greater energy and activity, they became everywhere the"
12165,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,dominant race. Policy and war fell into their hands: they supplied the
12166,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"more vigorous, intellectual, and imaginative element in the wonderful"
12167,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,composition of the Greek mind. Of the Pelasgian imagination it is
12168,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,difficult to speak in a definite manner: but it probably had not that
12169,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"masculine tone, and energetic movement, when alone, which marks the"
12170,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,mind of Greece.
12171,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12172,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Far more expansive than their Pelasgian antecessors, the Hellic tribes"
12173,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,availed themselves of the great advantages which the country offers
12174,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"for extended navigation, which was so essential as a means both of"
12175,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"communication, and of attracting the elements of civilization from"
12176,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"abroad. They were apt pupils under apt instructors, the Phœnician"
12177,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,mariners. They developed the Pelasgic religion into their more enlarged
12178,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and diversified mythology: they idealized the visible world together
12179,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"with human nature, and established those peculiar and pervasively"
12180,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,poetical relations between the seen and the unseen spheres of
12181,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"existence, which are the basis of the Greek mythology. Their keen sense"
12182,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,of the beautiful led them to adorn both the body and the mind of man
12183,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"with the attributes of deity, while their imaginative power continually"
12184,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,prompted them both to clothe celestial objects in shapes borrowed from
12185,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the visible world, and to equip the gods with sentiments and passions"
12186,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,drawn from the sphere of every day experience.
12187,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12188,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,They likewise brought with them the gymnastic element of the Greek
12189,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"system, the education of the body; and they made provision for this"
12190,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"education, in conjunction with a powerful means of national union, in"
12191,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the Games which became so famous through so many ages.
12192,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12193,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,The same qualities which found employment in fashioning the relations
12194,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"of earth to heaven, were likewise busy in uniting the past with the"
12195,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"present, by the agency of history in the form of song."
12196,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12197,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Of this race were the Achæans, who by their power and extension through"
12198,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Greece, gave to it and to its people their first famous designation,"
12199,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,that which they bore in the Homeric times. From the same source
12200,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"proceeded all the Hellenes, derivatively so called, and the Myrmidons."
12201,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Under the great Achæan name, understood in its special sense, are"
12202,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"probably included with the Pelopids, the Pylians, Cephallenians,"
12203,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Epeans, Myrmidons, Loerians. Nor can we be certain that it did not also"
12204,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,include those Æolid families whose power and extension subsequently
12205,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,impressed large portions of Greece with the Æolian name.
12206,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12207,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"While imperial cares and aims, and the refinements and enjoyments,"
12208,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"together with the stir, movement, and solicitude of life, fell to the"
12209,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Hellic portion of the Greek societies, and took its form from them,"
12210,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the Pelasgian element, though depressed below the surface, continued"
12211,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,to live and act with vigour; it predominated in the classes which form
12212,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the solid _substratum_ of society, those on which rural industry, if"
12213,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"not those on which mechanical pursuits depended, and from which the"
12214,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"upper surface, when exhausted by the prolonged performance of its"
12215,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"functions, may draw in every society successive stocks of new materials"
12216,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,to renovate its vital forces.
12217,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12218,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,While Homer himself seems to represent the unbounded wealth and
12219,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"fulness, and the manifold and versatile power, of the composite Greek"
12220,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"mind, we appear to have, in the rural strains of Hesiod, if not in the"
12221,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"unenlivened theogonic traditions ascribed to him, the just and natural"
12222,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,exemplification of all that we might expect in a Pelasgic poet.
12223,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12224,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,_States especially Hellic or Pelasgic._
12225,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12226,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"In later, as well as in Homeric times, the Arcadians seem in the most"
12227,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,marked manner to have exhibited the Pelasgic aspect of the Greek mind
12228,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and life: and they show it much in the same relation to the Hellic
12229,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"races, as that of the Saxons to the Norman chivalry. Like the Saxons,"
12230,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,it was not in bravery that they failed: they were ἐγχεσίμωροι and
12231,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"ἐπιστάμενοι πολεμίζειν: but in energy and passion, and likewise in"
12232,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"governing and organizing powers, they were beneath the competing race,"
12233,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"and therefore they gave way: while, from their enduring and solid"
12234,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"qualities, they were well qualified in after generations to supply the"
12235,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,greater waste caused by a more vivid temperament and keener action in
12236,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,the soil above them.
12237,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12238,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Among the Spartans we find developed, in a very peculiar degree, two"
12239,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,of the imperial elements of the Greek character. The first is that
12240,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"political faculty of the Hellic races, by which, as Strabo says, they"
12241,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"preserved their ἡγεμονία from the time of Lycurgus, down to the fifth"
12242,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,century.
12243,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12244,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"And the second is, the idea of the education of the body, as an"
12245,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,essential and main part of human training: a sentiment which to us may
12246,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"seem narrow, but we must remember that the Greeks kept fully in their"
12247,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"view what we have dropped from our theories, though it may be hoped,"
12248,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"not wholly from our practice, namely, the influence of bodily exercise"
12249,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and discipline in forming mental qualities and habits.
12250,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,
12251,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"It was to Attica, however, that was reserved the offices of exhibiting"
12252,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,in the fullest degree the manysidedness of the Greek character: and
12253,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"the efficient cause, by which she was fitted to fulfil this function,"
12254,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,probably may have been that constant infusion of new blood by the
12255,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"successive immigrations of the different Greek races, without the"
12256,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"absolute displacement of any of them on a large scale, which, as we"
12257,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"have seen, Thucydides remarks to have been her special characteristic."
12258,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Hence she always exhibited both the ancient and the fresh; both, too,"
12259,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"in the highest degree; urging, like Arcadia, the autochthonic origin of"
12260,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"her population, which must refer to its Pelasgic element; contending"
12261,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"with that state, and with Argos[607], for the honour of the traditions"
12262,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,touching Pelasgus and the worship of Ceres; but richer at the same time
12263,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"than any other Greek State, in the varied aggregate of the qualities,"
12264,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,which the composite or entire Greek mind appears to have owed to
12265,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Hellic infusion. Hence the breadth of the transition which, according"

12276,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"The Helli, thus travelling through Hellas, give it a name, and receive"

12278,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"they are no longer Helli but Hellenes, and have only a secondary"
12279,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,and derivative relation to their original home and stock. It is
12280,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"intelligible, that they should not wish to claim too close a kindred"
12281,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"with the ἀνιπτόποδες χαμαίευναι of Homer[609], although most ready to"

12291,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,be the probable and less copious cause of migration from the hills.
12292,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"But in any case, whether from the rapidity of their passage through"
12293,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"Thessaly, or from their having actually occupied no more than a small"

12299,4. GENERAL IDEAS.,"settlement, of which only the Achæan portion lived through the historic"

12535,SECT. VIII.,"Ἀργείους, καὶ Ἀχαιοὺς ἀνακαλεῖ. Why has the great historian arranged"

12537,SECT. VIII.,comparative frequency of their use: for the first is employed the
12538,SECT. VIII.,"smallest number of times, and the third is by far the most frequent."
12539,SECT. VIII.,For the present let us postpone seeking after the cause; and simply

12546,SECT. VIII.,"the various ways in which, so far as we have the means of tracing them"
12547,SECT. VIII.,"(which is but to a limited extent), the names attached by Homer to the"
12548,SECT. VIII.,inhabitants of particular countries are derived.
12549,SECT. VIII.,
12550,SECT. VIII.,They appear to come either
12551,SECT. VIII.,
12552,SECT. VIII.,"1. From an eponymist directly, who is also an original founder, as"
12553,SECT. VIII.,"Δαρδανοὶ, Τρῶες, from Dardanus, and Tros, in relation to Dardania and"
12554,SECT. VIII.,Troja respectively.
12555,SECT. VIII.,
12556,SECT. VIII.,"2. From the land they live in: and thus from an eponymist, if there has"
12557,SECT. VIII.,originally been one for the territory.
12558,SECT. VIII.,
12559,SECT. VIII.,"For example, we find Ἰθακήσιοι from an island Ἰθακὴ, which again was"
12560,SECT. VIII.,"derived from Ἰθακός. In a case like this, when the appellation of"
12561,SECT. VIII.,"the people comes not directly, but mediately from the name-giver, a"
12562,SECT. VIII.,"territorial designation intervening, we can draw no inference as to"
12563,SECT. VIII.,"the oneness of race between them and him. Thus in the case before us,"
12564,SECT. VIII.,"Ἰθακήσιοι, though connected with Ἰθακὴ, has not as of necessity, any"
12565,SECT. VIII.,connection whatever with Ἰθακὸς personally.
12566,SECT. VIII.,
12567,SECT. VIII.,"3. From the land they live in, as described by its most prominent"
12568,SECT. VIII.,physical characteristic.
12569,SECT. VIII.,
12570,SECT. VIII.,"For example, the Thracians (Θρῇκες), must evidently be so called from"
12571,SECT. VIII.,"the roughness of the country, as a cognate word to τρῆχυς, which is"
12572,SECT. VIII.,"thus applied to Ithaca,"
12573,SECT. VIII.,
12574,SECT. VIII.,"τρηχεῖ’, ἀλλ’ ἀγαθὴ κουρότροφος. Odyss. ix. 27."
12575,SECT. VIII.,
12576,SECT. VIII.,"Again, from Αἰγίαλος, the district afterwards called Achæa, we have,"
12577,SECT. VIII.,"in later Greek[613], the name Αἰγιαλεῖς for the inhabitants. This does"
12578,SECT. VIII.,"not occur in Homer, but we have what is equivalent to it in the name of"
12579,SECT. VIII.,"Αἰγιάλεια, who was wife of Diomed, and daughter of Adrastus, the former"
12580,SECT. VIII.,king of Sicyon in Ægialus. This is an instance of the application of
12581,SECT. VIII.,"the principle, not to the inhabitants at large, but to an individual"
12582,SECT. VIII.,inhabitant.
12583,SECT. VIII.,
12584,SECT. VIII.,4. The name of a population may be derived secondarily from that of
12585,SECT. VIII.,"another population. Thus while we must derive Ἕλληνες from Ἕλλας, this"
12586,SECT. VIII.,in its turn can only be drawn from the Ἕλλοι.
12587,SECT. VIII.,
12588,SECT. VIII.,"5. In the single case of the Athenians, we find the name of a"
12589,SECT. VIII.,population derived from that of a deity.
12590,SECT. VIII.,
12591,SECT. VIII.,"6. It is presumable, though not certain, that entire populations took"
12592,SECT. VIII.,their name from ruling individuals or races. It seems hardly possible
12593,SECT. VIII.,"to explain, for example, the name Καδμεῖοι, which nowhere connects"
12594,SECT. VIII.,"itself with any of the foregoing sources of eponymism, otherwise than"
12595,SECT. VIII.,"by reference to an individual Cadmus, whom Homer mentions in Od. v. 333."
12596,SECT. VIII.,
12597,SECT. VIII.,"The idea prevails extensively, at least by sufferance, that these three"
12598,SECT. VIII.,"great names are in Homer mere synonyms, and have no reference to any"
12599,SECT. VIII.,"actual and historical differences, either existing when Homer wrote, or"
12600,SECT. VIII.,known by him to have existed at a previous period.
12601,SECT. VIII.,
12602,SECT. VIII.,This question it is proposed now to examine. I commence by making a
12603,SECT. VIII.,broad admission. It is this.
12604,SECT. VIII.,
12605,SECT. VIII.,"Upon the face of the poems, and on almost all ordinary occasions,"
12606,SECT. VIII.,"Homer seems at first sight to use, and he very frequently does use,"
12607,SECT. VIII.,"as equivalent and interchangeable, those three principal designations"
12608,SECT. VIII.,which he applies to the Greeks in common.
12609,SECT. VIII.,
12610,SECT. VIII.,_Homer’s use of them distinctive._
12611,SECT. VIII.,
12612,SECT. VIII.,"It is a very important question, however, whether Homer knew of and"
12613,SECT. VIII.,"observed any distinctions between these names. For if he did, then"
12614,SECT. VIII.,"these mere commonplace words, as they are taken to be, may involve in"
12615,SECT. VIII.,them the germ of much early history.
12616,SECT. VIII.,
12617,SECT. VIII.,"In this investigation, we have the advantage of dealing in great"
12618,SECT. VIII.,"part, not with mere traditional assertion, but with facts. The use of"
12619,SECT. VIII.,"particular names, at particular epochs, for particular tribes, affords"
12620,SECT. VIII.,(if the text can be trusted for genuineness) a class of evidence
12621,SECT. VIII.,"analogous to that supplied by coins and inscriptions for history, or"
12622,SECT. VIII.,that afforded by geological phænomena with respect to the formation of
12623,SECT. VIII.,the globe.
12624,SECT. VIII.,
12625,SECT. VIII.,"The poems of Homer, particularly the Iliad, abound in passages relating"
12626,SECT. VIII.,to prior occurrences. These passages are not in general of a high
12627,SECT. VIII.,"order of poetical beauty, as compared with the rest of the poem; they"
12628,SECT. VIII.,often cause the action to hang rather heavily; many of them make
12629,SECT. VIII.,"up the speeches of old men, whose natural leaning to loquacity it"
12630,SECT. VIII.,"appears that the Poet has, with his usual skill, made to minister"
12631,SECT. VIII.,to the accomplishment of his own marked historic aims. But they are
12632,SECT. VIII.,"repositories stored, we may almost say packed, with the most curious"
12633,SECT. VIII.,and suggestive information.
12634,SECT. VIII.,
12635,SECT. VIII.,Some of them may be without date: but the time is generally fixed
12636,SECT. VIII.,"within limits sufficiently close, either by genealogies, or by the"
12637,SECT. VIII.,"period in the lives of the narrators, to which the tales belong. The"
12638,SECT. VIII.,war of the Elians and Pylians in the Eleventh Book took place in the
12639,SECT. VIII.,boyhood of Nestor: probably from fifty to sixty years before the war
12640,SECT. VIII.,"of Troy. The birth of Eurystheus, related in the Nineteenth Book, was"
12641,SECT. VIII.,probably earlier still by ten or twenty years. The other legends fall
12642,SECT. VIII.,into the interval between these events and the _Troica_. Now if we can
12643,SECT. VIII.,"trace a difference in the application by Homer of his appellatives,"
12644,SECT. VIII.,"either as to the times or the places, he may hereby conclusively,"
12645,SECT. VIII.,"though unconsciously, tell us a good deal about his view of the"
12646,SECT. VIII.,"succession, and the local distribution, of ruling races in Greece."
12647,SECT. VIII.,
12648,SECT. VIII.,Such a rule of difference is easy to be traced.
12649,SECT. VIII.,
12650,SECT. VIII.,"For example. In the Catalogue[614] and elsewhere, if in the course of"
12651,SECT. VIII.,the action he refers to the soldiers who proceeded from the country
12652,SECT. VIII.,"afterwards called Bœotia, he calls them Βοιωτοί. But where Agamemnon"
12653,SECT. VIII.,"has, or rather makes, occasion to tell a story of the same people"
12654,SECT. VIII.,"acting in prior history, he calls them, not Βοιωτοὶ, but once Καδμεῖοι,"
12655,SECT. VIII.,and once by the equivalent name Καδμειῶνες[615]. The tale is an account
12656,SECT. VIII.,"of the mission of Tydeus from Thebes to Mycenæ, in company with"
12657,SECT. VIII.,"Polynices, which had occurred under the Pelopid dynasty."
12658,SECT. VIII.,
12659,SECT. VIII.,"In this story it appears, that Tydeus and Polynices, first obtained"
12660,SECT. VIII.,"a promise of the help they wanted; but that, after they had departed,"
12661,SECT. VIII.,there was a change of resolution. Hence messengers were sent to
12662,SECT. VIII.,"acquaint Tydeus, and apparently to recall the force. The expression is"
12663,SECT. VIII.,"(Il. iv. 384),"
12664,SECT. VIII.,
12665,SECT. VIII.,ἔνθ’ αὖτ’ ἀγγελίην ἐπὶ Τύῃ στεῖλαν Ἀχαιοί.
12666,SECT. VIII.,
12667,SECT. VIII.,An allusion to this occurrence is again put into the mouth of Minerva
12668,SECT. VIII.,in Il. v. 800-7. The resemblance in the names used is so precise as
12669,SECT. VIII.,"to be almost _precisian_. Again, the Mycenians are named once, and"
12670,SECT. VIII.,"named as Ἀχαιοί. Again, the Thebans are named twice, and once it is as"
12671,SECT. VIII.,"Καδμεῖοι, once as Καδμείωνες."
12672,SECT. VIII.,
12673,SECT. VIII.,_Proofs of the distinctive use._
12674,SECT. VIII.,
12675,SECT. VIII.,These two instances fortify one another to such a degree by their
12676,SECT. VIII.,"concurrence, that, as I would submit, they would, even if they stood"
12677,SECT. VIII.,"alone, amount to a demonstration that Homer had regard to the times"
12678,SECT. VIII.,"and circumstances under which the several races prevailed, in those"
12679,SECT. VIII.,passages of his work which refer to particular incidents of prior
12680,SECT. VIII.,"history, personal and local. But there is no lack of other evidence."
12681,SECT. VIII.,
12682,SECT. VIII.,"First, we have other pieces of prior history, which affect the same"
12683,SECT. VIII.,portion of Greece. The first of these probably preceded the _Troica_
12684,SECT. VIII.,"by only two, or, at the utmost, two and a half generations. It is the"
12685,SECT. VIII.,"account of the birth of Eurystheus, given by Agamemnon himself in the"
12686,SECT. VIII.,Nineteenth Book. The scene of it is described as Ἄργος Ἀχαιïκόν. He
12687,SECT. VIII.,"calls it indeed by the name, which it still bore at the time when he"
12688,SECT. VIII.,"spoke, and which was understood by the hearers, for it remained the"
12689,SECT. VIII.,"same country as it had been in former times. But the same people, who"
12690,SECT. VIII.,"in the time of Tydeus, living under the Pelopids, were Ἀχαιοὶ, in"
12691,SECT. VIII.,"the time of Eurystheus, and therefore before the predominance of the"
12692,SECT. VIII.,"Pelopids, are described as Ἀργεῖοι. In Il. xix. 122, Juno thus speaks"
12693,SECT. VIII.,of the birth of Eurystheus
12694,SECT. VIII.,
12695,SECT. VIII.,"ἤδη ἀνὴρ γέγον’ ἐσθλὸς, ὃς Ἀργείοισιν ἀνάξει."
12696,SECT. VIII.,
12697,SECT. VIII.,"And again, v. 124, the same term is used."
12698,SECT. VIII.,
12699,SECT. VIII.,"Again, it appears from the Sixth Iliad that Prœtus, who expelled"
12700,SECT. VIII.,"Bellerophon about the same time, was king of the Ἀργεῖοι (Il. vi. 158);"
12701,SECT. VIII.,
12702,SECT. VIII.,"ὅς ῥ’ ἐκ δήμου ἔλασσεν, ἐπεὶ πολὺ φέρτερος ἦεν"
12703,SECT. VIII.,Ἀργείων.
12704,SECT. VIII.,
12705,SECT. VIII.,"According to extra-Homeric tradition, Prœtus was the brother of"
12706,SECT. VIII.,"Eurystheus. According to Homer, his power extends over Ephyre, and over"
12707,SECT. VIII.,"the Argives: and as Æolid dynasties were then ruling in the west, it"
12708,SECT. VIII.,"is the country afterwards called the Argos of the Achæans, within some"
12709,SECT. VIII.,part of which he must have ruled. But in telling both the story of
12710,SECT. VIII.,"Prœtus, and the story of Eurystheus, with reference to the same side of"
12711,SECT. VIII.,"Peloponnesus, and entirely out of connection with one another, the text"
12712,SECT. VIII.,"of Homer, true to itself, calls the subjects of each at that period,"
12713,SECT. VIII.,"only by the name Ἀργεῖοι, never Δαναοὶ or Ἀχαιοί."
12714,SECT. VIII.,
12715,SECT. VIII.,"Thus, one generation before the _Troica_ he calls people Achæans, and"
12716,SECT. VIII.,"calls them by that name only, whom one or two generations earlier he"
12717,SECT. VIII.,"describes, and repeatedly and uniformly describes, as having been"
12718,SECT. VIII.,Argives. There can hardly be stronger circumstantial evidence of the
12719,SECT. VIII.,"fact, that to each term he attached its own special meaning."
12720,SECT. VIII.,
12721,SECT. VIII.,And yet it is not simply that Homer has made the Argive the more
12722,SECT. VIII.,"ancient, and the Achæan the more recent, name. On the contrary, he uses"
12723,SECT. VIII.,both the one and the other with marked respect to place as well as to
12724,SECT. VIII.,time. For at the great Argive epoch he has Achæans: and at the great
12725,SECT. VIII.,"Achæan epoch, that of the poems, he has Argive associations, and a"
12726,SECT. VIII.,"local Argive designation, still remaining."
12727,SECT. VIII.,
12728,SECT. VIII.,"In the Eleventh Book, Nestor detains Patroclus with a speech of"
12729,SECT. VIII.,"great length. In the beginning of this harangue, he refers to the"
12730,SECT. VIII.,"circumstances of the moment, and, having ended his preface, he travels"
12731,SECT. VIII.,"back to his own early youth, indeed almost his childhood, to give the"
12732,SECT. VIII.,"story of a war, or foray, between the Epeans and the Pylians. When"
12733,SECT. VIII.,"he has ended this tale, he returns to the actual position of affairs"
12734,SECT. VIII.,before Troy.
12735,SECT. VIII.,
12736,SECT. VIII.,"In the narrative of this raid[616], he commonly terms the one side"
12737,SECT. VIII.,"Epeans, and the other Pylians. But he once calls the Epeans, who were"
12738,SECT. VIII.,"inhabitants of Elis, Elians. This is natural enough: for as the Elian"
12739,SECT. VIII.,name afterwards (and so soon as in the time of Homer) prevailed in
12740,SECT. VIII.,"that race and country, it might very well have been already beginning"
12741,SECT. VIII.,to come into use. But he also calls the Pylians Achæans; and he uses
12742,SECT. VIII.,"the name distinctively, for it is where he is speaking of them as the"
12743,SECT. VIII.,conquering party[617]. For this there is clearly no corresponding
12744,SECT. VIII.,reason. It is equally clear that Homer does not call the Pylians
12745,SECT. VIII.,"Ἀχαιοὶ, simply in the sense of being Greeks, for then the name would"
12746,SECT. VIII.,not have been distinctive: the enemy too would have been included with
12747,SECT. VIII.,"them, which would turn the passage into nonsense. Homer, then, (there"
12748,SECT. VIII.,"is no other alternative) means to say that the Pylians were, in some"
12749,SECT. VIII.,"particular sense, of the Achæan race."
12750,SECT. VIII.,
12751,SECT. VIII.,"This is the more worthy of remark, when we look to the preamble and"
12752,SECT. VIII.,"peroration of the speech. For in both of these, which refer to the"
12753,SECT. VIII.,"whole body of the Greeks and to the Trojan epoch, he employs his usual"
12754,SECT. VIII.,"names, and calls them both Danaans (Δαναῶν οὐ κήδεται, v. 665, also"
12755,SECT. VIII.,"vid. 797), and Argives (Ἀργείων ἀέκητι, v. 667): finally Achæans (υἷες"
12756,SECT. VIII.,"Ἀχαιῶν, 800)."
12757,SECT. VIII.,
12758,SECT. VIII.,Thus then he calls the Pylians Achæans at the time of the Argive
12759,SECT. VIII.,predominance: for this local war could hardly have been more than ten
12760,SECT. VIII.,"or twenty years after the birth of Eurystheus, and must therefore have"
12761,SECT. VIII.,"been before, or else during his reign; that is to say, at a time when"
12762,SECT. VIII.,his own subjects are called Ἀργεῖοι.
12763,SECT. VIII.,
12764,SECT. VIII.,Again. Homer uses the word Ἀργεῖος in the feminine singular fifteen
12765,SECT. VIII.,times. Twice it is with reference to Juno. Of course this application
12766,SECT. VIII.,"of the term is figurative. But though it be figurative, the figure"
12767,SECT. VIII.,"is evidently founded on her close and intimate relation, not to the"
12768,SECT. VIII.,"Greeks at large only, but to the Argive name; and to the persons, but"
12769,SECT. VIII.,"more particularly to the place, that was so specially associated with"
12770,SECT. VIII.,it[618].
12771,SECT. VIII.,
12772,SECT. VIII.,"In all the other thirteen places, the epithet is joined with the name"
12773,SECT. VIII.,"of Helen. Does it for her mean simply Greek, or something special and"
12774,SECT. VIII.,"beyond this? Now if it meant simply Greek, it would be strange that"
12775,SECT. VIII.,"she is never called, I will not say Δαναὴ, because the Danaan name has"
12776,SECT. VIII.,"no singular use in Homer, but certainly Ἀχαιὴ or Ἀχαίïς. Especially as"
12777,SECT. VIII.,"the word Ἀχαιὸς is used as an epithet, be it remembered, many times"
12778,SECT. VIII.,"oftener, than is Ἀργεῖος: and it alone is used to describe the women of"
12779,SECT. VIII.,Greece generally.
12780,SECT. VIII.,
12781,SECT. VIII.,"Again, if the epithet Argive, as applied to Helen, meant simply Greek,"
12782,SECT. VIII.,it might be suitable enough in the mouth of a Trojan speaking among
12783,SECT. VIII.,"Trojans, but it would have been weak and unmeaning, and therefore most"
12784,SECT. VIII.,"unlike Homer, in the mouth of a Greek or a friend of Greeks; or when,"
12785,SECT. VIII.,"as in the Odyssey[619], Helen is no longer among strangers, but at"
12786,SECT. VIII.,"home. Yet it is used in the following passages among others, (1) by"
12787,SECT. VIII.,"Juno to Minerva, Il. ii. 161, (2) by Minerva to Ulysses, Il. ii. 177;"
12788,SECT. VIII.,"and here in a near juxtaposition with the Achæan appellative, which"
12789,SECT. VIII.,goes far to prove of itself that Ἀργείη has a meaning more specific
12790,SECT. VIII.,"than merely Greek. The passage is,"
12791,SECT. VIII.,
12792,SECT. VIII.,"Ἀργείην Ἑλένην, ἧς εἵνεκα πολλοὶ Ἀχαιῶν"
12793,SECT. VIII.,ἐν Τροίῃ ἀπόλοντο.
12794,SECT. VIII.,
12795,SECT. VIII.,I doubt whether Homer ever places in such proximity the two epithets
12796,SECT. VIII.,"with the same meaning for each[620]. The tautology would be gross, if"
12797,SECT. VIII.,Achæan and Argeian each meant neither more nor less than Greek: but if
12798,SECT. VIII.,"Ἀργείη have the local sense, nothing awkward remains. (3) It is used by"
12799,SECT. VIII.,"Agamemnon, Il. iii. 458, in addressing the Trojans; (4) Il. iv. 174, in"
12800,SECT. VIII.,"addressing Menelaus; (5) Il. ix. 140, in addressing the Greek Council."
12801,SECT. VIII.,"It seems quite clear, from even this enumeration, that Ἀργείη, as"
12802,SECT. VIII.,"applied to Helen, must mean something different from the mere fact that"
12803,SECT. VIII.,she belonged to the Greek nation at large.
12804,SECT. VIII.,
12805,SECT. VIII.,Nor is it difficult to find a meaning. Homer indeed leaves us but
12806,SECT. VIII.,narrow information as to the extraction of Helen. He calls her
12807,SECT. VIII.,"sometimes εὐπατέρεια[621], and many times Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα[622]. In the"
12808,SECT. VIII.,"Third Iliad he shows her to be the sister of Castor and Pollux, and"
12809,SECT. VIII.,in the Eleventh Odyssey he shows them to be the children of Tyndareus
12810,SECT. VIII.,and Leda[623]. Who Tyndareus was we do not know from him. But the
12811,SECT. VIII.,"common tradition, which makes him a sovereign in Eastern Peloponnesus,"
12812,SECT. VIII.,"is thoroughly accordant with the slight notices in Homer. For, as"
12813,SECT. VIII.,"we see from the cases of Eurystheus and Prœtus, it was in Eastern"
12814,SECT. VIII.,"Peloponnesus that the Argive power and name prevailed; and Helen, the"
12815,SECT. VIII.,"daughter of Tyndareus is, as we have also seen, characteristically"
12816,SECT. VIII.,"with him the Argive Helen. Thus then it may now be lawful to say, we"
12817,SECT. VIII.,are supplied with a meaning for the name which makes it especially
12818,SECT. VIII.,"appropriate in the mouth of Agamemnon, the head of the Pelopids. For"
12819,SECT. VIII.,"they were the race who, coming in at the head of the Achæans, had from"
12820,SECT. VIII.,"the West overpowered and superseded the Argive power of the East,"
12821,SECT. VIII.,while they also held as heirs to it by marriage: and if a royal Argive
12822,SECT. VIII.,house at the epoch of the war survived only in Helen and her sister
12823,SECT. VIII.,"Clytemnestra, she in part at least represented its title, and, as a"
12824,SECT. VIII.,"lawful wife of Menelaus, added to his throne whatever authority the"
12825,SECT. VIII.,name and rights of her race were capable of conferring.
12826,SECT. VIII.,
12827,SECT. VIII.,"Having, I trust, seen enough to justify the belief that some at least"
12828,SECT. VIII.,of these names in the mind of Homer had a definite as well as a more
12829,SECT. VIII.,"general meaning, let us now, taking them in succession, proceed to"
12830,SECT. VIII.,examine what that meaning is.
12831,SECT. VIII.,
12832,SECT. VIII.,_The Danaans of Homer._
12833,SECT. VIII.,
12834,SECT. VIII.,"Among the three great Homeric appellatives, let us direct our attention"
12835,SECT. VIII.,"first to the one, which is presumably the oldest. The word Δαναοὶ, from"
12836,SECT. VIII.,"the comparative paucity of the signs and indications connected with it,"
12837,SECT. VIII.,evidently answers to this description.
12838,SECT. VIII.,
12839,SECT. VIII.,"We will take first the Homeric, and then the later, evidence respecting"
12840,SECT. VIII.,"it. Of the former, the greater number of particulars are negative."
12841,SECT. VIII.,"Indeed we have but two positive notes to dwell upon; both of these,"
12842,SECT. VIII.,"however, are of great importance."
12843,SECT. VIII.,
12844,SECT. VIII.,1. The Danaan name is with Homer a standing appellation of the Greeks.
12845,SECT. VIII.,"I think, however, it can be shown that it never means the Greek nation,"
12846,SECT. VIII.,but always the Greek armament or soldiery.
12847,SECT. VIII.,
12848,SECT. VIII.,It is used in the Iliad one hundred and forty-seven times. The name
12849,SECT. VIII.,"Ἀργεῖοι is employed oftener, namely, one hundred and seventy-seven"
12850,SECT. VIII.,"times in the plural, besides eleven times in the singular as a personal"
12851,SECT. VIII.,epithet: and Ἀχαιοὶ much more frequently still.

12856,SECT. VIII.,"means of the epithets which Homer annexes to them, we shall find they"
12857,SECT. VIII.,establish perceptible distinctions.
12858,SECT. VIII.,
12859,SECT. VIII.,The epithets of Δαναοὶ are exclusively military epithets:

12867,SECT. VIII.,7. ταχύπωλοι.
12868,SECT. VIII.,
12869,SECT. VIII.,The epithets of Ἀργεῖοι are as follows:
12870,SECT. VIII.,
12871,SECT. VIII.,"1. ἰόμωροι, Il. iv. 242. xiv. 479."
12872,SECT. VIII.,"2. ἀπειλάων ἀκόρητοι, Il. xiv. 479."
12873,SECT. VIII.,"3. θωρηκτοί, Il. xxi. 429."
12874,SECT. VIII.,"4. φιλοπτόλεμοι, Il. xix. 269."
12875,SECT. VIII.,"5. ἐλεγχέες, Il. iv. 242."
12876,SECT. VIII.,
12877,SECT. VIII.,"Upon these we may observe, first, that they are few in number;"
12878,SECT. VIII.,"secondly, that they are used with extreme rarity; being only applied"
12879,SECT. VIII.,"in four passages altogether, whereas the word Δαναοὶ has epithets in"
12880,SECT. VIII.,"twenty-two. Thirdly, this word only twice in the whole of the poems"
12881,SECT. VIII.,"has a military epithet attached to it. For I must follow those, who do"
12882,SECT. VIII.,not translate ἰόμωροι as corresponding with ἐγχεσίμωροι: (1) because
12883,SECT. VIII.,"the Greeks were not archers, (2) because the derivation from ἴα,"
12884,SECT. VIII.,"‘the voice,’ giving the sense of braggart, harmonises exactly with"
12885,SECT. VIII.,the accompanying phrase ἀπειλάων ἀκόρητοι: as well as (3) for the
12886,SECT. VIII.,"presumptive, but in Homer by no means conclusive, reason, that ἴον in"
12887,SECT. VIII.,composition is long.
12888,SECT. VIII.,
12889,SECT. VIII.,"The epithets of Ἀχαιοὶ are numerous, highly varied, and of very"
12890,SECT. VIII.,frequent use. They are these:

12907,SECT. VIII.,
12908,SECT. VIII.,"These epithets are used in nearly one hundred and thirty passages, and"

12911,SECT. VIII.,"(1) One or two words of sarcastic reproach, very rarely used."
12912,SECT. VIII.,
12913,SECT. VIII.,"(2) Words descriptive of courage and spirit: such are μεγάθυμοι,"

12917,SECT. VIII.,"traceable in the military conduct of the Greeks, as well as glaringly"
12918,SECT. VIII.,palpable among the Trojans.
12919,SECT. VIII.,
12920,SECT. VIII.,(4) Words descriptive of personal beauty: ἑλικῶπες and καρηκομόωντες.
12921,SECT. VIII.,
12922,SECT. VIII.,"(5) The word δῖοι, which signifies generally the possession of some"
12923,SECT. VIII.,kind of excellence.

12927,SECT. VIII.,
12928,SECT. VIII.,"And of the epithets of the three appellatives respectively we may say,"
12929,SECT. VIII.,
12930,SECT. VIII.,"(1) Those of Ἀχαιοὶ are highly diversified, extended, and elevated in"
12931,SECT. VIII.,meaning: and are not suitable for soldiers exclusively.
12932,SECT. VIII.,
12933,SECT. VIII.,(2) Those of Ἀργεῖοι are so slight and rare that they may be passed

12936,SECT. VIII.,"(3) Those of Δαναοὶ are most properly neither those of chiefs, nor of"
12937,SECT. VIII.,"a nation at large, but of a soldiery."
12938,SECT. VIII.,
12939,SECT. VIII.,In the Odyssey the Danaan name is used thirteen times: but it never
12940,SECT. VIII.,signifies either the Greeks contemporary with the action of that

12942,SECT. VIII.,"retrospectively, and always of the soldiery in the Trojan war."

12944,SECT. VIII.,"It will be observed by readers of the poems, that Homer often brings"
12945,SECT. VIII.,"two of the three great appellatives, or even all the three, into"
12946,SECT. VIII.,"juxtaposition so near, as would be inconvenient upon the supposition"
12947,SECT. VIII.,"that they are purely synonymous. For instance, in Il. i. 71, we have"
12948,SECT. VIII.,"Ἀργεῖοι and Ἀχαιοὶ in the same line, and in Il. i. 90, 91, Δαναοὶ and"
12949,SECT. VIII.,"Ἀχαιοὶ in two successive lines. It is, I think, obvious, that this"
12950,SECT. VIII.,"inconvenience will be mitigated or removed, if it can be shown that"
12951,SECT. VIII.,"each of these three names, though they were most commonly applied"
12952,SECT. VIII.,"to mean the same body of persons, nevertheless had its own shade"
12953,SECT. VIII.,"of meaning. And we shall presently have to examine cases, where a"
12954,SECT. VIII.,determination of this kind appears to be required by the sense[624].
12955,SECT. VIII.,
12956,SECT. VIII.,All the rest of the Homeric evidence connected with the name Δαναοὶ is
12957,SECT. VIII.,of a negative character.
12958,SECT. VIII.,
12959,SECT. VIII.,"It is never used in the singular number, either as an adjective, or as"
12960,SECT. VIII.,"a substantive. Nor is it ever applied to women: a point not immaterial,"
12961,SECT. VIII.,"in connection with the question, whether with Homer it does not mean"
12962,SECT. VIII.,"the Greeks of the army exclusively. There is, again, nothing in his use"
12963,SECT. VIII.,"of it which associates it with a particular class of the army, either"
12964,SECT. VIII.,"the lower or the higher; but it appears to be essentially general,"
12965,SECT. VIII.,"comprehensive, and, I may add, likewise invariable in its meaning."
12966,SECT. VIII.,
12967,SECT. VIII.,"Still less should we expect to find it, nor do we find it, connected"
12968,SECT. VIII.,with the inhabitants of any particular part of the country: it has
12969,SECT. VIII.,"not, like the Cadmean or Cephallenian name, a local habitation within"
12970,SECT. VIII.,"Greece. Nor has it in itself any root, or any derivative, which would"
12971,SECT. VIII.,"associate it with any territory, as Αἰγιαλεῖς refers us to Αἰγίαλος, or"
12972,SECT. VIII.,even as Ἄρκαδες is related to Ἀρκαδίη.
12973,SECT. VIII.,
12974,SECT. VIII.,Its use in the Iliad is in exact harmony with that in the Odyssey: it
12975,SECT. VIII.,is never associated with the history of the Greeks or any part of them:
12976,SECT. VIII.,"in short, there is no clear evidence of its existence or application"
12977,SECT. VIII.,beyond the limits of the camp.
12978,SECT. VIII.,
12979,SECT. VIII.,Neither has it any thing related to the physical character of the
12980,SECT. VIII.,"country, or to any of the races known to have inhabited it, or to any"
12981,SECT. VIII.,"employment or habit of life, or to any deity. It floats before us like"
12982,SECT. VIII.,"Delos on the Ægean, without any visible or discoverable root. And the"
12983,SECT. VIII.,"only question is, whether the slight positive evidence at our command"
12984,SECT. VIII.,"is not so limited, and so hemmed in on all sides by negatives, as to"
12985,SECT. VIII.,determine the hypothesis that may be drawn from it to one particular
12986,SECT. VIII.,"form, by forbidding us to move, except in one particular direction."
12987,SECT. VIII.,
12988,SECT. VIII.,"It is quite plain that the Danaan name must have had some root, lying"
12989,SECT. VIII.,very deep in the history or legends of Greece: since it would not have
12990,SECT. VIII.,"been possible for Homer, as a poet of the people, handling a subject"
12991,SECT. VIII.,"the most profoundly national, to describe the Greek army under any"
12992,SECT. VIII.,"name, except one associated with some of the most splendid, or the most"
12993,SECT. VIII.,"venerable, traditions of the country."
12994,SECT. VIII.,
12995,SECT. VIII.,_Danaan name dynastic._
12996,SECT. VIII.,
12997,SECT. VIII.,In one way alone could this name fulfil the required condition. If
12998,SECT. VIII.,"its root was not territorial, nor tribal, nor religious, it could"
12999,SECT. VIII.,"only be personal. Was there, then, a Danaus known to the early"
13000,SECT. VIII.,"history of Greece, who founded a dynasty in its centre of power, at"
13001,SECT. VIII.,"a period anterior to the Hellenic history of the country, so as not"
13002,SECT. VIII.,"to be in competition with the honours of that race? If so, then it"
13003,SECT. VIII.,is intelligible that the Greeks might be called Δαναοὶ by Homer. If
13004,SECT. VIII.,"that dynasty had passed away, we can well understand why Δαναοὶ should"
13005,SECT. VIII.,not be a name of contemporary Greeks as such: just as Καδμεῖοι was
13006,SECT. VIII.,"not an admissible designation for contemporary Bœotians. Further, if"
13007,SECT. VIII.,"it had never been an historical appellative at all, but was the mere"
13008,SECT. VIII.,"reflection cast by the figure of a great primitive personage, and"
13009,SECT. VIII.,"incorporated, for the Poet’s purpose, in a designation made national"
13010,SECT. VIII.,"by him, then we can see how natural it was, that he should limit the"
13011,SECT. VIII.,word altogether to an heroic and martial sense; just as Cambrian
13012,SECT. VIII.,"for Welshman, or Caledonian for Scotchman, or Gael for Highlander,"
13013,SECT. VIII.,"or son of Albion for Englishman, would be an appellation naturally"
13014,SECT. VIII.,"appropriated to romance, or war, or any strain impregnated with a"
13015,SECT. VIII.,"strong vein of imagery or passion, but yet would not be suitable for"
13016,SECT. VIII.,the purposes of pure history.
13017,SECT. VIII.,
13018,SECT. VIII.,"In this inquiry concerning the Danaan name, we must, I think, carry"
13019,SECT. VIII.,"along with us, as a cardinal element in the case, that which we know"
13020,SECT. VIII.,from other sources respecting the manner in which Homer was wont to
13021,SECT. VIII.,"veil all traces of the entry from elsewhere of races, persons, or"
13022,SECT. VIII.,"influences into Greece. It must never be forgotten, that, throughout"
13023,SECT. VIII.,"the whole of the poems, there is apparently not one single statement,"
13024,SECT. VIII.,made to us with the intention of conveying information respecting
13025,SECT. VIII.,the colonization of Greece from abroad. It seems to be the Poet’s
13026,SECT. VIII.,"intention that we should assume all Greek manners, institutions, and"
13027,SECT. VIII.,"races, to have sprung out of the very soil: and it is only accidentally"
13028,SECT. VIII.,"that he imparts to us any information or suggestion on this subject,"
13029,SECT. VIII.,"when he is in quest of some other purpose, and unawares lets fall a"
13030,SECT. VIII.,gleam of light upon some foreign settlement or immigration.
13031,SECT. VIII.,
13032,SECT. VIII.,All this is conformable to the course of natural feeling. Shakespeare
13033,SECT. VIII.,"found it worth his while to sing of Lear, but not of Hengist and Horsa;"
13034,SECT. VIII.,"of the English in France, not of the Normans in England. And though"
13035,SECT. VIII.,"Danish invasions have not robbed our great Alfred of his fame, yet for"
13036,SECT. VIII.,"a long time, in order to guard its brilliancy, it may have been that we"
13037,SECT. VIII.,coloured in our own favour the military history of the period. Arrivals
13038,SECT. VIII.,"from abroad, in the early periods of the life of a nation, are usually"
13039,SECT. VIII.,"the conquests, in one form or another, of foreigners over natives: of"
13040,SECT. VIII.,what is strange to the soil over what is associated with it. It can
13041,SECT. VIII.,"hardly be, that such narratives should be popular. An abnormal instance"
13042,SECT. VIII.,"to the contrary may be found in the fable, which deduced the Julian"
13043,SECT. VIII.,line in Rome from Æneas: but this was for poetry composed a thousand
13044,SECT. VIII.,years after the date of its narrative; composed when the line of
13045,SECT. VIII.,"national continuity with those, whom Æneas was taken to have conquered,"
13046,SECT. VIII.,"had been completely broken; and composed for the ears of a court, when"
13047,SECT. VIII.,the pulse of national life had become almost insensible. Even the
13048,SECT. VIII.,"process, by which Hellenes mastered Pelasgians, is nowhere professedly"
13049,SECT. VIII.,related by Homer; whose purpose it was to unite more closely the
13050,SECT. VIII.,"elements of the nation, and not to record that they had once been"
13051,SECT. VIII.,separate.
13052,SECT. VIII.,
13053,SECT. VIII.,_Compared with the Cadmean._
13054,SECT. VIII.,
13055,SECT. VIII.,"Except in the one point, that the name Καδμεῖοι had had a clear and"
13056,SECT. VIII.,"undeniable place in prior history, there is a marked analogy between"
13057,SECT. VIII.,the modes in which Homer treats the Cadmean and the Danaan stories.
13058,SECT. VIII.,"In each of the two cases, general tradition tells us of a foreigner,"
13059,SECT. VIII.,"who enters Greece and founds a dynasty. This dynasty, after acting"
13060,SECT. VIII.,"powerfully on the destinies of the country for some generations, in"
13061,SECT. VIII.,"the course of time disappears, the name dying with it. All this,"
13062,SECT. VIII.,"in the first of the two instances, we have seen to be sufficiently"
13063,SECT. VIII.,supported by inference and suggestion from Homer. Yet Homer never
13064,SECT. VIII.,"mentions Cadmus, except as it were by chance, in the act of giving the"
13065,SECT. VIII.,extraction of Leucothee[625]; nor states that he came from abroad;
13066,SECT. VIII.,"nor that he founded a dynasty at all. He gives us Cadmus, father of"
13067,SECT. VIII.,"Leucothee, and Cadmeans, and lets us make of them what we can. So here"
13068,SECT. VIII.,"he gives us Danaans, and not indeed a Danaus, but a Danae, who is"
13069,SECT. VIII.,presumably related to Danaus.
13070,SECT. VIII.,
13071,SECT. VIII.,"2. In Iliad xiv., Jupiter renders an account of his passion for various"
13072,SECT. VIII.,"women, all of them persons in the very highest positions; and among"
13073,SECT. VIII.,these for Danae[626].
13074,SECT. VIII.,
13075,SECT. VIII.,"Δανάης καλλισφύρου Ἀκρισιώνης,"

13077,SECT. VIII.,
13078,SECT. VIII.,_The line of Danae._
13079,SECT. VIII.,
13080,SECT. VIII.,In this passage we have Danae exhibited as the head of a line of
13081,SECT. VIII.,"sovereigns through Perseus, who occupied the most ancient and"
13082,SECT. VIII.,"most distinguished seat of power in Greece, that of the Eastern"
13083,SECT. VIII.,"Peloponnesus. From her, indeed, the derivation of sovereignty is"
13084,SECT. VIII.,locally continuous down to the time of Homer. Perseus is the father
13085,SECT. VIII.,"of Sthenelus[627], and Sthenelus of Eurystheus. Next to him, we find"
13086,SECT. VIII.,"Pelops in possession of the throne, with a new sceptre, betokening"
13087,SECT. VIII.,"a new sovereignty. That is to say, he was no longer a merely local"
13088,SECT. VIII.,"sovereign, whose highest honour it was to be first in that class,"
13089,SECT. VIII.,"_primus inter pares_; but he had also acquired an extensive supremacy,"
13090,SECT. VIII.,"reaching beyond his own borders, or those of the Achaic Argos, and"
13091,SECT. VIII.,"embracing all Greece, with a multitude of islands[628]."
13092,SECT. VIII.,
13093,SECT. VIII.,"Such is the line of Danae downwards: beginning with a son, whose"
13094,SECT. VIII.,"paternal extraction we shall consider hereafter[629]. And her epoch,"
13095,SECT. VIII.,"as we shall see, is six generations before the Trojan war. For tracing"
13096,SECT. VIII.,"her upwards, we have no means from Homer, except such as are afforded"
13097,SECT. VIII.,by the word Ἀκρισιώνη. The use of a patronymic which describes Danae
13098,SECT. VIII.,"as the daughter (most probably) of Acrisius, in some degree makes it"
13099,SECT. VIII.,"likely that Acrisius either was the brother of Danaus, or otherwise"
13100,SECT. VIII.,"collaterally related, rather than directly descended from him. For,"
13101,SECT. VIII.,"had Danae herself been descended from Danaus, it seems improbable"
13102,SECT. VIII.,that she would have drawn her patronymic from the less distinguished
13103,SECT. VIII.,"Acrisius, unless Danaus was a very remote ancestor. But this is very"
13104,SECT. VIII.,improbable: for seven generations before Troy form the utmost limit
13105,SECT. VIII.,of Homer’s historical knowledge; and where all besides falls within
13106,SECT. VIII.,"that line, it is improbable that there should be a single exception"
13107,SECT. VIII.,"reaching greatly beyond it. And again, from the course of migration, it"
13108,SECT. VIII.,"is likely that we should find his oldest traditions in Asia, and not"
13109,SECT. VIII.,"in Europe. On the other hand, that Homer should stop short in tracing"
13110,SECT. VIII.,"the lineage onwards, just before he came to the foreign immigrant,"
13111,SECT. VIII.,is in exact conformity with what he has done in omitting to connect
13112,SECT. VIII.,"Œdipus and Epicaste[630] with Cadmus, or Pelops with Tantalus. In the"
13113,SECT. VIII.,"former of these two cases, the omission all the more cogently suggests"
13114,SECT. VIII.,"design, because Epicaste is the only woman introduced in the Νεκυΐα"
13115,SECT. VIII.,"without mention of her husband, among all those, eight in number, of"
13116,SECT. VIII.,"whose cases he gives us the detail. It is most probable, therefore,"
13117,SECT. VIII.,"that Homer meant the genealogy to stand as follows: and at the least,"
13118,SECT. VIII.,it must not be thought that the text of Homer gives countenance either
13119,SECT. VIII.,"directly or indirectly to those later fables, which throw back the"
13120,SECT. VIII.,first Greek dynasties into a very remote antiquity.

13131,SECT. VIII.,_Epoch of the dynasty._
13132,SECT. VIII.,
13133,SECT. VIII.,"According to these presumptions, Danaus is contemporary with"
13134,SECT. VIII.,Dardanus[631]: and also is just such a person as Homer’s poetic use of
13135,SECT. VIII.,"the name Δαναοὶ would lead us to expect; one who came from abroad, and"
13136,SECT. VIII.,"is on that account kept in majestic shadow; one who founded a throne,"
13137,SECT. VIII.,but did not introduce a race: one who may have given his people the
13138,SECT. VIII.,"name of Δαναοὶ, as Cadmus gave that of Καδμεῖοι, for the time while"
13139,SECT. VIII.,"his dynasty was in power, but whose name disappeared, together with"
13140,SECT. VIII.,"its sway. We have, it will be remembered in Homer, no Homeric legends"
13141,SECT. VIII.,"of the period of the Danaids, so that we do not know whether the name"
13142,SECT. VIII.,Δαναοὶ was then in any degree national or not.
13143,SECT. VIII.,
13144,SECT. VIII.,"According to the post-Homeric tradition, Danaus was an Egyptian[632],"
13145,SECT. VIII.,"brother of Ægyptus. He migrated into Greece, and became king of Argos."
13146,SECT. VIII.,Acrisius and Prœtus were reputed to be his great-grandsons.
13147,SECT. VIII.,
13148,SECT. VIII.,"In Homer, too, we have an Acrisius and a Prœtus: but Prœtus is"
13149,SECT. VIII.,"contemporary with Bellerophon, two generations before the _Troica_, so"
13150,SECT. VIII.,"that he is later by four generations than Acrisius, and later by at"
13151,SECT. VIII.,least four than Danaus.
13152,SECT. VIII.,
13153,SECT. VIII.,"The more recent tradition, contradicting Homer positively in this, as"
13154,SECT. VIII.,"in so many instances, carries Prœtus back to the time of Acrisius, and"
13155,SECT. VIII.,"then, paying some respect to the interval between Prœtus and Danaus,"
13156,SECT. VIII.,gives compensation by thrusting Danaus himself three generations
13157,SECT. VIII.,further back.
13158,SECT. VIII.,
13159,SECT. VIII.,"Of the posterity of the Homeric Prœtus we hear nothing, and with him"
13160,SECT. VIII.,"the Danaid line, prolonged in a junior branch, may have expired."
13161,SECT. VIII.,Tradition places him on the throne of Tiryns. His holding a separate
13162,SECT. VIII.,sovereignty in Argolis is not of itself in conflict with the Homeric
13163,SECT. VIII.,"account of the Perseids, who reigned at Mycenæ; because we find in"
13164,SECT. VIII.,Argos itself a separate sovereignty under Diomed at the epoch of the
13165,SECT. VIII.,_Troica_. But the terms used are peculiar. Prœtus ruled over Ἀργεῖοι;
13166,SECT. VIII.,
13167,SECT. VIII.,πολὺ φέρτερος ἦεν
13168,SECT. VIII.,Ἀργείων· Ζεὺς γάρ οἱ ὑπὸ σκηπτρῷ ἐδάμασσεν[633].
13169,SECT. VIII.,
13170,SECT. VIII.,"The account of Eurystheus in the Nineteenth Book may, however, imply"
13171,SECT. VIII.,that he was king of all the Ἀργεῖοι: and at first sight there is some
13172,SECT. VIII.,"conflict here, because both Eurystheus and Prœtus may be said to"
13173,SECT. VIII.,date two generations before the _Troica_. The solution is probably
13174,SECT. VIII.,"as follows. The passion of Antea, wife of Prœtus, for Bellerophon,"
13175,SECT. VIII.,"suggests that her husband was more advanced in life than Bellerophon,"
13176,SECT. VIII.,"whom, as the grandfather of Glaucus, we may take as justly representing"
13177,SECT. VIII.,"in time the second generation before the war. On the other hand, as"
13178,SECT. VIII.,"Eurystheus was the contemporary of Hercules, and Hercules had a son,"
13179,SECT. VIII.,"as well as grandsons in the war, we may assume Eurystheus to have been"
13180,SECT. VIII.,"junior to the generation, as Prœtus was its senior; so that they need"
13181,SECT. VIII.,not have been contemporary princes.
13182,SECT. VIII.,
13183,SECT. VIII.,"The historic place assigned to Danaus, either as we might fix it from"
13184,SECT. VIII.,"Homer, or as the later tradition would determine it, keeps him clear"
13185,SECT. VIII.,of the earliest Hellic traditions in southern Greece. None of these
13186,SECT. VIII.,can well be carried back beyond Sisyphus; and Sisyphus stands at five
13187,SECT. VIII.,"generations before the war, while Danaus cannot be less than seven. Had"
13188,SECT. VIII.,"Homer made Danaus synchronise with the earlier Hellic sovereignties, it"
13189,SECT. VIII.,"would have been, in my view, a presumption against his Egyptian origin,"
13190,SECT. VIII.,or his existence altogether. For an Egyptian stranger was little likely
13191,SECT. VIII.,"to attain to power, where Hellenes were already in the field: the more"
13192,SECT. VIII.,energetic genius would subdue the less vigorous. The expulsion of the
13193,SECT. VIII.,"Hellenic Bellerophon, and the plot against his life, may really have"
13194,SECT. VIII.,been connected with the political jealousies of the Danaids towards
13195,SECT. VIII.,the formidable new-comers of the Æolid stem: nor do I read the fable
13196,SECT. VIII.,"of Jupiter with Danae otherwise than as a veil, used to give dignity"
13197,SECT. VIII.,"to the commencement of an Hellic sovereignty, which, in the person of"
13198,SECT. VIII.,"Perseus, partly succeeded, partly supplanted, the Danaid throne."
13199,SECT. VIII.,
13200,SECT. VIII.,"Danaus has been mentioned by Hesiod, the first among the later"
13201,SECT. VIII.,"authorities. This poet states, that he relieved Argos from drought: an"
13202,SECT. VIII.,operation which harmonises well with the tradition that brings him from
13203,SECT. VIII.,"a country dependent on the irrigation of the Nile, as the conditions of"
13204,SECT. VIII.,cultivation there could not but lead at an early date to care in the
13205,SECT. VIII.,"management of water. He likewise calls Perseus by the name of Δαναίδης,"
13206,SECT. VIII.,and also terms him the son of Danae[634].
13207,SECT. VIII.,
13208,SECT. VIII.,The only point of connection between the Danaids and the Argive or
13209,SECT. VIII.,"Argeian name is, that Prœtus, the last of the Danaids, reigns over"
13210,SECT. VIII.,"Argeians. But this is at a period when the Perseid house, which was"
13211,SECT. VIII.,"evidently Hellenic, has already become the first in rank among the"
13212,SECT. VIII.,"Greek thrones, and has given, as is probable, the Argeian name to the"
13213,SECT. VIII.,"people of Eastern Peloponnesus. The whole evidence, therefore, throws"
13214,SECT. VIII.,"the Danaan name, with all its incidents, back to a period anterior to"
13215,SECT. VIII.,that of Argeians and of Achæans.
13216,SECT. VIII.,
13217,SECT. VIII.,"But if the Danai were thus before the Ἀργεῖοι and before the Ἀχαιοὶ,"
13218,SECT. VIII.,whom did they follow?
13219,SECT. VIII.,
13220,SECT. VIII.,_Post-Homeric tradition._
13221,SECT. VIII.,
13222,SECT. VIII.,The evidence of Æschylus in the Supplices supports the tradition
13223,SECT. VIII.,"which makes them immediately follow the Pelasgi[635], or which, more"
13224,SECT. VIII.,"strictly, represents their name as the first of those borne by the"
13225,SECT. VIII.,Greek nation after it had ceased to be simply Pelasgic.
13226,SECT. VIII.,
13227,SECT. VIII.,"By Euripides was conveyed a kindred tradition, that Danaus, having come"
13228,SECT. VIII.,"to Argos, colonized the city of Inachus; and that the Peloponnesians,"
13229,SECT. VIII.,"previously called Pelasgiotes, were thereafter called Danai[636]."
13230,SECT. VIII.,
13231,SECT. VIII.,"Πελασγιῶτας δ’ ὠνομασμένους, τὸ πρὶν"
13232,SECT. VIII.,Δαναοὺς καλεῖσθαι νόμον ἔθηκ’ ἀν’ Ἑλλάδα.
13233,SECT. VIII.,
13234,SECT. VIII.,"These traditions, received through the tragedians, coincide with the"
13235,SECT. VIII.,"evidence of the Homeric text. For this text, in the first place,"
13236,SECT. VIII.,clearly throws the Danaan line farther back than that of any of the
13237,SECT. VIII.,"Hellic tribes. Secondly, by negative evidence, no where employing the"
13238,SECT. VIII.,"Danaan name in the pre-Troic legends, he leaves us to infer that it"
13239,SECT. VIII.,"must have been the oldest, and the most remote from common use, of his"
13240,SECT. VIII.,"three great appellations. Thirdly, Homer supplies us with no other name"
13241,SECT. VIII.,which there is the smallest ground for inserting between the Danaans
13242,SECT. VIII.,"and the ancient Pelasgi, of whom we have found traces, direct and"
13243,SECT. VIII.,"indirect, in so many places of the poems."
13244,SECT. VIII.,
13245,SECT. VIII.,"Thus, then, although we can plead little but conjecture from Homer with"
13246,SECT. VIII.,"respect to the person Danaus, we seem to be justified in concluding"
13247,SECT. VIII.,"from his testimony, that the appellation was dynastic, that the dynasty"
13248,SECT. VIII.,"was pre-Hellenic, and that it stands in chronological order next to the"
13249,SECT. VIII.,Pelasgic time.
13250,SECT. VIII.,
13251,SECT. VIII.,The name Ἀργεῖοι is the next with which we have to deal: and this
13252,SECT. VIII.,"name, applicable to persons, is so evidently founded on the name"
13253,SECT. VIII.,"Ἄργος, applicable to territory, that with this latter word we must of"
13254,SECT. VIII.,necessity begin the investigation; just as in order to arrive at the
13255,SECT. VIII.,"meaning of the term Hellenes, we were obliged to begin with Hellas."
13256,SECT. VIII.,
13257,SECT. VIII.,_Applications of the name Argos._
13258,SECT. VIII.,
13259,SECT. VIII.,"And the word Ἄργος is so important, and as it were central, in the"
13260,SECT. VIII.,"geography of Homer, that we had better first consider what are the"
13261,SECT. VIII.,various forms of expression which Homer uses when he wants to express
13262,SECT. VIII.,in words the entire territory of the Greek nation:
13263,SECT. VIII.,
13264,SECT. VIII.,1. We have already seen that he appears to use for this purpose the
13265,SECT. VIII.,combined force of the names Hellas and Argos;
13266,SECT. VIII.,
13267,SECT. VIII.,"ἀνδρὸς, τοῦ κλέος εὐρὺ καθ’ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος[637]."
13268,SECT. VIII.,
13269,SECT. VIII.,2. He employs other combinations for the like purpose. The first
13270,SECT. VIII.,"is that of Ἄργος, extended by the epithet πᾶν, and joined with the"
13271,SECT. VIII.,islands. These words taken together embrace the whole Empire of
13272,SECT. VIII.,Agamemnon:
13273,SECT. VIII.,
13274,SECT. VIII.,"πολλῇσιν νήσοισι, καὶ Ἄργει παντὶ ἀνάσσειν[638]."
13275,SECT. VIII.,
13276,SECT. VIII.,"3. And again, with the proper name Ἀχαïὶς,"
13277,SECT. VIII.,
13278,SECT. VIII.,"Ἄργος ἐς ἱππόβοτον, καὶ Ἀχαïίδα καλλιγύναικα[639]."
13279,SECT. VIII.,
13280,SECT. VIII.,This is spoken by the Trojan herald of the possible adjustment of the
13281,SECT. VIII.,"quarrel, upon which, he says, we shall dwell quietly in Troy, and"
13282,SECT. VIII.,_they_ will return to Argos and Achæis. By “they” he means all the
13283,SECT. VIII.,"Greeks, therefore the country to which they return means all Greece."
13284,SECT. VIII.,
13285,SECT. VIII.,"4. It may be a question whether Ἄργος, in combination with μέσος,"
13286,SECT. VIII.,"includes the whole of Greece, as in the speech of Diomed to Glaucus:"
13287,SECT. VIII.,
13288,SECT. VIII.,τῷ νῦν σοι μὲν ἐγὼ ξεῖνος φίλος Ἄργεï μέσσῳ
13289,SECT. VIII.,"εἰμὶ, σὺ δ’ ἐν Λυκίῃ[640]."
13290,SECT. VIII.,
13291,SECT. VIII.,"5. It is also a question, what is the geographical force of Argos, even"
13292,SECT. VIII.,when standing alone. It is manifestly wide in certain passages. Thus
13293,SECT. VIII.,"Paris mentions the κτήματα,"
13294,SECT. VIII.,
13295,SECT. VIII.,ὅσσ’ ἀγόμην ἐξ Ἄργεος ἡμέτερον δῶ[641]:
13296,SECT. VIII.,
13297,SECT. VIII.,"and Polydamas, speaking of the possible destruction of the Greek army,"
13298,SECT. VIII.,
13299,SECT. VIII.,νωνύμνους ἀπολέσθαι ἀπ’ Ἄργεος ἐνθάδ’ Ἀχαιούς[642].
13300,SECT. VIII.,
13301,SECT. VIII.,"a line repeated elsewhere. On the other hand, the word in some places"
13302,SECT. VIII.,has undoubtedly a limited meaning only.
13303,SECT. VIII.,
13304,SECT. VIII.,"6. Again, we find the word Ἀχαίïς γαῖα, used apparently with the"
13305,SECT. VIII.,intention of signifying the whole Greek country; as in the first Iliad
13306,SECT. VIII.,by Nestor;
13307,SECT. VIII.,
13308,SECT. VIII.,"ὦ πόποι, ἢ μέγα πένθος Ἀχαίïδα γαῖα ἱκάνει[643]."
13309,SECT. VIII.,
13310,SECT. VIII.,"7. And we have the same word Ἀχαίïς without γαῖα, both in the Iliad and"
13311,SECT. VIII.,the Odyssey.
13312,SECT. VIII.,
13313,SECT. VIII.,"For instance, when Nestor and Ulysses were collecting the Greek forces,"
13314,SECT. VIII.,they were
13315,SECT. VIII.,
13316,SECT. VIII.,λαὸν ἀγείροντες κατ’ Ἀχαίïδα πουλυβότειραν[644].
13317,SECT. VIII.,
13318,SECT. VIII.,"And Ulysses, addressing his mother in the Shades beneath, says,"
13319,SECT. VIII.,
13320,SECT. VIII.,"οὐ γάρ πω σχέδον ἦλθον Ἀχαίïδος, οὐδέ πω ἀμῆς"
13321,SECT. VIII.,γῆς ἐπέβην[645].
13322,SECT. VIII.,
13323,SECT. VIII.,"To proceed first with what is most clear, I think it may be taken"
13324,SECT. VIII.,"for certain that Ἀχαίïς, with or without the affix γαῖα or αἶα[646],"
13325,SECT. VIII.,means nothing less than the whole of Greece in the passages where
13326,SECT. VIII.,"Homer uses this appellative alone. One passage, indeed, taken alone,"
13327,SECT. VIII.,affords decisive proof for itself that even the islands are included.
13328,SECT. VIII.,Telemachus[647] thus describes his mother as unrivalled in Greece:
13329,SECT. VIII.,
13330,SECT. VIII.,οἵη νῦν οὐκ ἔστι γύνη κατ’ Ἀχαίïδα γαῖαν
13331,SECT. VIII.,"οὔτε Πύλου ἱερῆς, οὔτ’ Ἄργεος, οὔτε Μυκήνης,"
13332,SECT. VIII.,"οὔτ’ αὐτῆς Ἰθάκης, οὔτ’ ἠπείροιο μελαίνης."
13333,SECT. VIII.,
13334,SECT. VIII.,"For here are clearly enumerated as among the parts of Ἀχαίïς, several"
13335,SECT. VIII.,"Peloponnesian states, the island of Ithaca, and the continent,"
13336,SECT. VIII.,evidently meaning that to the North of the Corinthian gulf.
13337,SECT. VIII.,
13338,SECT. VIII.,"And yet it may remain true that, though commonly meaning Greece at"
13339,SECT. VIII.,"large, Ἀχαίïς may still have a more special connection with the South,"
13340,SECT. VIII.,"as the whole of this island is called Britain, whereas the name has"
13341,SECT. VIII.,been derived especially from its southern inhabitants.
13342,SECT. VIII.,
13343,SECT. VIII.,But in the passages numbered (1) and (3) we find the whole of Greece
13344,SECT. VIII.,"designated by the use, not of one, but of two expressions: in the first"
13345,SECT. VIII.,"case they are,"
13346,SECT. VIII.,
13347,SECT. VIII.,1. Ἕλλας.
13348,SECT. VIII.,2. μέσον Ἄργος.
13349,SECT. VIII.,
13350,SECT. VIII.,"In the second they are,"
13351,SECT. VIII.,
13352,SECT. VIII.,1. Ἄργος.
13353,SECT. VIII.,2. Ἀχαίïς.
13354,SECT. VIII.,
13355,SECT. VIII.,"And with these we may compare the expression, evidently meant to cover"
13356,SECT. VIII.,"all the Greeks, in Il. ii. 530, under the names"
13357,SECT. VIII.,
13358,SECT. VIII.,1. Πανέλληνες.
13359,SECT. VIII.,2. Ἀχαιοί.
13360,SECT. VIII.,
13361,SECT. VIII.,Now there are here three ways in which the words may be used so as to
13362,SECT. VIII.,"convey their joint sense, which I assume to be that of Greece _entire_:"
13363,SECT. VIII.,viz.
13364,SECT. VIII.,
13365,SECT. VIII.,"1. That each word should cover a part, the two parts together making up"
13366,SECT. VIII.,"the whole, _i.e._ that the words should be used distributively."
13367,SECT. VIII.,
13368,SECT. VIII.,"2. That each should cover the whole, and that the words should be used"
13369,SECT. VIII.,cumulatively.
13370,SECT. VIII.,
13371,SECT. VIII.,"3. That one of the words should apply to a part of Greece only, and"
13372,SECT. VIII.,"should be overlapped as it were by the other, that other meaning the"
13373,SECT. VIII.,whole.
13374,SECT. VIII.,
13375,SECT. VIII.,Now as Ἀχαίïς uniformly means all Greece in eight passages where it
13376,SECT. VIII.,"stands alone, this will naturally govern its sense in the two passages,"
13377,SECT. VIII.,where it is joined copulatively with Ἄργος. We shall also hereafter
13378,SECT. VIII.,"see the local use of the Ἀχαιοὶ so diffused, that it would hardly be"
13379,SECT. VIII.,"possible to suppose any other meaning. Thus, then, we have one point"
13380,SECT. VIII.,"fixed, from which to operate upon others."
13381,SECT. VIII.,
13382,SECT. VIII.,But what does the Ἄργος ἱππόβοτον mean?
13383,SECT. VIII.,
13384,SECT. VIII.,It is demonstrable that in Homer the word Ἄργος has several meanings.
13385,SECT. VIII.,
13386,SECT. VIII.,"1. It is a city, as in Il. iv. 51,"
13387,SECT. VIII.,
13388,SECT. VIII.,ἤτοι ἐμοὶ τρεῖς μὲν πολὺ φίλταται εἰσὶ πόληες
13389,SECT. VIII.,"Ἄργος τε, Σπάρτη τε, καὶ εὐρυάγυια Μυκήνη."
13390,SECT. VIII.,τὰς διαπέρσαι κ.τ.λ.
13391,SECT. VIII.,
13392,SECT. VIII.,"2. It is a limited territory, probably such as was afterwards the State"
13393,SECT. VIII.,"of Argolis. For when Telemachus is quitting Sparta, Theoclymenus joins"
13394,SECT. VIII.,"him[648], φεύγων ἐξ Ἄργεος. And again, when Melampus quitted Pylos, he"
13395,SECT. VIII.,came to Argos:
13396,SECT. VIII.,
13397,SECT. VIII.,ὁ δ’ ἄλλων ἵκετο δῆμον
13398,SECT. VIII.,Ἄργος ἐς ἱππόβοτον[649].
13399,SECT. VIII.,
13400,SECT. VIII.,The first proves that Sparta was not included in the geographical name
13401,SECT. VIII.,Ἄργος: the second proves the same of Pylos: and this too is the Ἄργος
13402,SECT. VIII.,ἱππόβοτον.
13403,SECT. VIII.,
13404,SECT. VIII.,"The same phrase is used in Od. iii. 263, of Ægisthus, who endeavours to"
13405,SECT. VIII.,"corrupt Clytemnestra,"
13406,SECT. VIII.,
13407,SECT. VIII.,μυχῷ Ἄργεος ἱπποβότοιο.
13408,SECT. VIII.,
13409,SECT. VIII.,"Here Mycenæ is plainly meant by the μυχὸς, and the Ἄργος ἱππόβοτον is"
13410,SECT. VIII.,"Argolis, or something like it."
13411,SECT. VIII.,
13412,SECT. VIII.,"This district, including Mycenæ, was the head quarter of the Greek"
13413,SECT. VIII.,"power. Now we find that the whole dominion of Priam was named Τροίη,"
13414,SECT. VIII.,"while including many cities and much territory, and the name Τροίη"
13415,SECT. VIII.,"was also sometimes applied to the capital, of which the proper name"
13416,SECT. VIII.,was Ilion. So Venezia at the present day means both a city and a
13417,SECT. VIII.,"territory, even though the city is outside the territory; the only"
13418,SECT. VIII.,distinction lying in the use or non-use of the article. Therefore it
13419,SECT. VIII.,"was sufficiently natural, that the Trojan herald should name the whole"
13420,SECT. VIII.,"from the most excellent part, and so identify them: and on the other"
13421,SECT. VIII.,"hand, it would not be otherwise than natural, were he to name the"
13422,SECT. VIII.,"most excellent part, and likewise to name the whole, without verbally"
13423,SECT. VIII.,distinguishing them.
13424,SECT. VIII.,
13425,SECT. VIII.,"So that in Il. iii. 75, 258, the phrase Ἄργος ἐς ἱππόβοτον, according"
13426,SECT. VIII.,"to what has preceded, may either mean,"
13427,SECT. VIII.,
13428,SECT. VIII.,1. The part of the Peloponnesus containing Argos and Mycenæ as its
13429,SECT. VIII.,"head quarter, (and then the line must be interpreted in the third of"
13430,SECT. VIII.,"the modes above pointed out; as we might now say, ‘we visited Rome and"
13431,SECT. VIII.,Italy.’)
13432,SECT. VIII.,
13433,SECT. VIII.,"2. Or it may mean the whole of Greece, by transfer from its capital"
13434,SECT. VIII.,"part, and then the line must be interpreted in the second mode, as"
13435,SECT. VIII.,"might now be said, ‘to our Green Erin, our Ireland mother of the brave.’"
13436,SECT. VIII.,
13437,SECT. VIII.,The English ‘and’ would indeed mar the sense: but the Greek καὶ is much
13438,SECT. VIII.,"more elastic, and may be equivalent to the Italian _ossia_, or to the"
13439,SECT. VIII.,sign =.
13440,SECT. VIII.,
13441,SECT. VIII.,I doubt if there be any passage in Homer where the word Argos stands
13442,SECT. VIII.,"alone, or with a characteristic epithet such as ἱππόβοτον, and where"
13443,SECT. VIII.,it requires any other sense than one of the three just given--the
13444,SECT. VIII.,city--the north east of Peloponnesus--and (by metonymy) all Greece.
13445,SECT. VIII.,
13446,SECT. VIII.,When Nestor (Il. ii. 348) denounces those Greeks who should think of
13447,SECT. VIII.,"returning home before the mind of Jupiter is known, and calls returning"
13448,SECT. VIII.,"Ἄργοσδε ἰέναι, it seems indisputable that we must construe Ἄργος Greece."
13449,SECT. VIII.,
13450,SECT. VIII.,"When Paris says he brought the κτήματα from Argos, the most natural"
13451,SECT. VIII.,"construction is, as the place was Sparta, and therefore not Argos in"
13452,SECT. VIII.,"the narrow sense, from which he took them, that he means by Argos to"
13453,SECT. VIII.,signify Greece.
13454,SECT. VIII.,
13455,SECT. VIII.,"When Sisyphus dwells at Ephyre, μυχῷ Ἄργεος ἱπποβότοιο, the word means"
13456,SECT. VIII.,the north eastern district Peloponnesus[650].
13457,SECT. VIII.,
13458,SECT. VIII.,The word Ἄργος in the Catalogue (ii. 559) most probably means the city
13459,SECT. VIII.,only.
13460,SECT. VIII.,
13461,SECT. VIII.,"As it is plain that in some passages it cannot mean the Peloponnesus,"
13462,SECT. VIII.,and as that meaning does not appear to be supported by superior
13463,SECT. VIII.,"probability in any place, such a meaning ought not to be admitted."
13464,SECT. VIII.,
13465,SECT. VIII.,_Achaic and Iasian Argos._
13466,SECT. VIII.,
13467,SECT. VIII.,It is another question how we ought to construe the phrases μέσον
13468,SECT. VIII.,"Ἄργος--Ἀχαιïκὸν Ἄργος, used four times--and Ἴασον Ἄργος."
13469,SECT. VIII.,
13470,SECT. VIII.,"The two latter are evidently analogous to Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος, which we"
13471,SECT. VIII.,have already found to mean Thessaly.
13472,SECT. VIII.,
13473,SECT. VIII.,"Of the four passages where we read the phrase Ἀχαιïκὸν Ἄργος, the"
13474,SECT. VIII.,"two first[651] relate to the return of Agamemnon and the Greeks, and"
13475,SECT. VIII.,appear to admit therefore either of the limited sense of a portion of
13476,SECT. VIII.,"Peloponnesus as the most eminent part, or of the extended one of all"
13477,SECT. VIII.,"Greece, better than of the intermediate one of Peloponnesus itself,"
13478,SECT. VIII.,"with which neither Agamemnon, nor the whole body of the Greeks, had"
13479,SECT. VIII.,"any separate and defined relation, as they had with the dominions of"
13480,SECT. VIII.,"Agamemnon in the capacity of their supreme Chief, and perhaps with"
13481,SECT. VIII.,"those of the Pelopid family jointly, so as to include Menelaus."
13482,SECT. VIII.,
13483,SECT. VIII.,"In the third case it is used of Juno, as she goes to hasten the birth"
13484,SECT. VIII.,"of Eurystheus[652],"
13485,SECT. VIII.,
13486,SECT. VIII.,"καρπαλίμως δ’ ἵκετ’ Ἄργος Ἀχαιïκὸν, ἔνθ’ ἄρα ᾔδη"
13487,SECT. VIII.,ἰφθίμην ἄλοχον Σθενέλου Περσηïάδαο.
13488,SECT. VIII.,
13489,SECT. VIII.,"This passage evidently admits the sense of the city, or a limited"
13490,SECT. VIII.,"district, better than that of the Peloponnesus at large. Indeed, as"
13491,SECT. VIII.,"the seat of the Perseid dominion is evidently intended, and as that"
13492,SECT. VIII.,"dominion did not reach over all Peloponnesus, we may say that this"
13493,SECT. VIII.,could not be the meaning of the words.
13494,SECT. VIII.,
13495,SECT. VIII.,But the fourth passage requires a larger signification for this phrase.
13496,SECT. VIII.,"It is the question of Telemachus, asking where Menelaus had been during"
13497,SECT. VIII.,all the time that Ægisthus was about his crime[653];
13498,SECT. VIII.,
13499,SECT. VIII.,ποῦ Μενέλαος ἔην;
13500,SECT. VIII.,"ἢ οὐκ Ἄργεος ἦεν Ἀχαιïκοῦ, ἀλλὰ πῇ ἄλλῃ"
13501,SECT. VIII.,πλάζετ’ ἐπ’ ἀνθρώπους;
13502,SECT. VIII.,
13503,SECT. VIII.,"This seems clearly to include Sparta in Achaic Argos; and, this"
13504,SECT. VIII.,"being so, no meaning is so suitable to it in this place as Eastern"
13505,SECT. VIII.,Peloponnesus. This construction is also eminently suitable to the
13506,SECT. VIII.,"relation between Eastern Peloponnesus and the Achæan power, which had"
13507,SECT. VIII.,its central seat there.
13508,SECT. VIII.,
13509,SECT. VIII.,Undoubtedly Strabo treats Ἀχαιïκὸν Ἄργος as meaning the whole of
13510,SECT. VIII.,"Peloponnesus (viii. 5. p. 365, ibid. 6. p. 369), but the argument from"
13511,SECT. VIII.,Homer’s text seems to be against him: and even he admits from Od. iii.
13512,SECT. VIII.,"249, that the term applied also to Laconia in particular: ἀλλὰ καὶ"
13513,SECT. VIII.,ἰδίως τὴν Λακωνικὴν οὕτω προσαγορευθῆναι[654].
13514,SECT. VIII.,
13515,SECT. VIII.,As then it appears that the sense of Eastern Peloponnesus will suit the
13516,SECT. VIII.,"phrase Ἄργος Ἀχαιïκὸν in all the four passages where it is employed,"
13517,SECT. VIII.,while the more extended meaning of the whole Peloponnesus is required
13518,SECT. VIII.,"by none, and could only be even admissible in one (Od. iii. 249), we"
13519,SECT. VIII.,may conclude that Eastern Peloponnesus is the proper meaning of the
13520,SECT. VIII.,phrase.
13521,SECT. VIII.,
13522,SECT. VIII.,_Iasian Argos._
13523,SECT. VIII.,
13524,SECT. VIII.,We now come to Ἴασον Ἄργος.
13525,SECT. VIII.,
13526,SECT. VIII.,"In Od. xviii. 245, Eurymachus the Suitor, in paying a compliment to the"
13527,SECT. VIII.,"beauty of Penelope, says to her, you would have more suitors than you"
13528,SECT. VIII.,"have,"
13529,SECT. VIII.,
13530,SECT. VIII.,εἰ παντές σε ἴδοιεν ἀν’ Ἴασον Ἄργος Ἀχαιοί.
13531,SECT. VIII.,
13532,SECT. VIII.,"Now it must first be admitted, that this does not refer to any country"
13533,SECT. VIII.,"out of the Peloponnesus. For in the first place, that was the most"
13534,SECT. VIII.,"distinguished part of the country, and the chief Achæan seat; so that"
13535,SECT. VIII.,the intention of this speech therefore most naturally bears upon it.
13536,SECT. VIII.,But also we have nothing in Homer to connect any local use of the word
13537,SECT. VIII.,Ἄργος with Middle Greece.
13538,SECT. VIII.,
13539,SECT. VIII.,"But if Eurymachus means nothing to the North of Peloponnesus, it is"
13540,SECT. VIII.,again most probable that he refers to that part of Peloponnesus with
13541,SECT. VIII.,"which Ithaca had most intercourse, where lay its relations of business,"
13542,SECT. VIII.,"and of hospitality. Now this part was Western Peloponnesus, as we see"
13543,SECT. VIII.,from the journey of Ulysses to Ephyre (Od. i. 260); from the journey
13544,SECT. VIII.,"of Telemachus which, as it were, spontaneously takes that direction;"
13545,SECT. VIII.,from the course of public transactions implied in his speech (Od. iii.
13546,SECT. VIII.,"82, cf. 72); from the χρεῖος, which Ulysses went to recover in Messene"
13547,SECT. VIII.,(Od. xxi. 15); from Nestor’s being the person to visit Ithaca in the
13548,SECT. VIII.,matter of the great Trojan quarrel; and from the apprehension felt by
13549,SECT. VIII.,"the party of the Suitors, that Ulysses would forthwith repair to Elis,"
13550,SECT. VIII.,or to Pylos for aid. (Od. xxiv. 431.)
13551,SECT. VIII.,
13552,SECT. VIII.,Just so the relations of Crete were with Eastern Peloponnesus; and
13553,SECT. VIII.,"therefore Helen at Troy recognises Idomeneus, because she has often"
13554,SECT. VIII.,"seen him in Sparta. And this, I may observe in passing, is probably"
13555,SECT. VIII.,"the reason why Ulysses, in the fictitious accounts which he gives"
13556,SECT. VIII.,"of himself in Ithaca, is so fond of making himself a Cretan, namely"
13557,SECT. VIII.,"that he may avoid any risk of detection, by placing his own proper"
13558,SECT. VIII.,whereabout at a distance beyond the ordinary range of intercourse.
13559,SECT. VIII.,
13560,SECT. VIII.,Nor are we wholly without information from Homer on the subject of
13561,SECT. VIII.,"the original Iasus himself, from whom the name appears to be derived;"
13562,SECT. VIII.,and whose name we find still subsisting in Attica at the time of the
13563,SECT. VIII.,_Troica_[655].
13564,SECT. VIII.,
13565,SECT. VIII.,"For a passage in the Eleventh Odyssey informs us that Amphion, son"
13566,SECT. VIII.,"of Iasus[656], was a powerful prince in Minyeian Orchomenus: that"
13567,SECT. VIII.,"his youngest daughter, the beautiful Chloris, was queen of Pylos: and"
13568,SECT. VIII.,"that Neleus, marrying her, founded there the dynasty of the Neleids."
13569,SECT. VIII.,Thus through Pylos we connect a powerful Iasid family with Western
13570,SECT. VIII.,"Peloponnesus, possibly five generations before the Trojan war, and at a"
13571,SECT. VIII.,time when we find from Homer that the Danaids or Perseus must have been
13572,SECT. VIII.,reigning in Eastern Peloponnesus. This seems enough to justify putting
13573,SECT. VIII.,the sense of Western Peloponnesus upon the phrase Ἴασον Ἄργος in the
13574,SECT. VIII.,speech of Eurymachus.
13575,SECT. VIII.,
13576,SECT. VIII.,"We may justly inquire whether it is so certain, as seems to be taken"
13577,SECT. VIII.,"for granted, that the Minyeian Orchomenus, where Amphion reigned, was"
13578,SECT. VIII.,the Orchomenus of Bœotia. For his daughter Chloris was sovereign of
13579,SECT. VIII.,"Pylos, and we must suppose that sovereignty to have been not acquired"
13580,SECT. VIII.,"by herself, but inherited from her father. Now it is very improbable"
13581,SECT. VIII.,that Amphion could have been sovereign at the same time of Pylos and
13582,SECT. VIII.,of the northern Orchomenos: between which intervened an Æolid family
13583,SECT. VIII.,"settled at the Isthmus, another race of Hellenic chiefs, the line"
13584,SECT. VIII.,"of Portheus, in Ætolia, and perhaps also the dynasty of Cadmus in"
13585,SECT. VIII.,Bœotia. We have no instance in Homer of the possession by the same
13586,SECT. VIII.,prince of territories not continuous. Now there was there a river
13587,SECT. VIII.,"Minyeius, between Pylos and Elis; in Arcadia as well as in Bœotia there"
13588,SECT. VIII.,"was an Orchomenos at the period of Homer; it seems then probable,"
13589,SECT. VIII.,that the name of that town should be combined with the Minyeian name
13590,SECT. VIII.,"in Peloponnesus as well as in Bœotia. If it were so, the political"
13591,SECT. VIII.,"connection with Pylos is natural, and the application of the Iasian"
13592,SECT. VIII.,name to Western Peloponnesus becomes still more easy of explication.
13593,SECT. VIII.,"But even though the Orchomenos here named be Bœotian, the case remains"
13594,SECT. VIII.,"sufficiently clear. For it was once, or formerly (τότε) that Amphion"
13595,SECT. VIII.,"reigned in Orchomenus; and the meaning may well be, that having in"
13596,SECT. VIII.,"earlier life reigned there, he had afterwards accompanied the southward"
13597,SECT. VIII.,"movement of the time, perhaps being expelled from his fat soil; and"
13598,SECT. VIII.,"that he established, or re-established the connection between Western"
13599,SECT. VIII.,Peloponnesus and the Iasian name.
13600,SECT. VIII.,
13601,SECT. VIII.,"Lastly, the place μέσον Ἄργος seems to be equivalent to the English"
13602,SECT. VIII.,"expression, ‘through the breadth of Argos,’ or _all over_ Argos;"
13603,SECT. VIII.,and though we may think that Ἄργος alone means one side of the
13604,SECT. VIII.,"Peloponnesus, μέσον Ἄργος may very well mean the whole. In the speech"
13605,SECT. VIII.,"of Diomed[657] to Glaucus, it cannot mean less than this: on the other"
13606,SECT. VIII.,"hand, from its being the counterpart of Lycia, it may perhaps not"
13607,SECT. VIII.,"less probably signify the whole of settled Greece, and thus be the"
13608,SECT. VIII.,equivalent of πᾶν Ἄργος in Il. ii. 108. But the more convenient sense
13609,SECT. VIII.,"for Od. xv. 80 is plainly the Peloponnesus, because then it squares"
13610,SECT. VIII.,"precisely with Hellas in the same passage, and the two together make"
13611,SECT. VIII.,up the whole of Greece. But without disturbing the signification of
13612,SECT. VIII.,"the word Hellas, as meaning Northern and Middle Greece, we might still"
13613,SECT. VIII.,give to μέσον Argos the force of ‘all Greece.’ The words of Menelaus
13614,SECT. VIII.,would then stand as if an inhabitant of London said to his friend a
13615,SECT. VIII.,"foreigner, ‘I will take you through Scotland and all Britain.’ It is"
13616,SECT. VIII.,"difficult, however, to decide absolutely between these two senses of"
13617,SECT. VIII.,"μέσον Ἄργος. What we see plainly is, that the word Ἄργος had taken"
13618,SECT. VIII.,"the deepest root, and a very wide range, in connection with Greek"
13619,SECT. VIII.,"settlements, and with such settlements only."
13620,SECT. VIII.,
13621,SECT. VIII.,"And now with respect to the line so much criticised,"
13622,SECT. VIII.,
13623,SECT. VIII.,ἐγχείῃ δ’ ἐκέκαστο Πανέλληνας καὶ Ἀχαιούς[658].
13624,SECT. VIII.,
13625,SECT. VIII.,"The word Πανέλληνες may, we have seen, either mean the tribes of Greece"
13626,SECT. VIII.,"beyond the Isthmus, or those of all Greece: in which latter and more"
13627,SECT. VIII.,likely sense it is coextensive with Ἀχαιοί. I here finally touch upon
13628,SECT. VIII.,"this verse along with those properly geographical, on account of the"
13629,SECT. VIII.,important combination which it involves.
13630,SECT. VIII.,
13631,SECT. VIII.,_The Apian land._
13632,SECT. VIII.,
13633,SECT. VIII.,"We find in Il. i. 270, iii. 49, and in Od. vii. 25, xvi. 18, the"
13634,SECT. VIII.,"expression ἀπίη γαίη, which some of the grammarians, and the common"
13635,SECT. VIII.,"opinion mentioned by Strabo[659], have explained to mean the"
13636,SECT. VIII.,"Peloponnesus, while modern scholars render it simply distant[660]. In"
13637,SECT. VIII.,"the two passages of the Iliad, the former construction is certainly"
13638,SECT. VIII.,"more suitable: and the combination with τηλόθεν in Il. i. 270, is"
13639,SECT. VIII.,"tautological, flat, and un-Homeric, if ἀπίη mean merely distant. In"
13640,SECT. VIII.,Od. xvi. 18 either sense will serve the passage. In Od. vii. 25 (when
13641,SECT. VIII.,we again have τηλόθεν) Ulysses states himself to have come ἐξ ἀπίης
13642,SECT. VIII.,"γαίης. As he had not come from Peloponnesus, it is assumed that this"
13643,SECT. VIII.,"is not the meaning. I question the reasoning. Ulysses everywhere,"
13644,SECT. VIII.,"when questioned, shows an immense fertility in fiction about himself:"
13645,SECT. VIII.,"in every case, however, carefully reporting himself to be come from"
13646,SECT. VIII.,a distant spot. I see no reason therefore why we should not construe
13647,SECT. VIII.,Ἀπίη γαῖα to mean the Peloponnesus; in conformity with the tradition
13648,SECT. VIII.,"which Æschylus[661] reports concerning Apis, and with the undoubted"
13649,SECT. VIII.,usage of the tragedians. As I interpret the Outer or Romance-geography
13650,SECT. VIII.,"of the Odyssey, the Peloponnesus would be understood by the Phæacians"
13651,SECT. VIII.,of Homer to be extremely remote from their country. The difference of
13652,SECT. VIII.,quantity is no sufficient reason against this construction. Plainly
13653,SECT. VIII.,"Ἀπίη γαίη, if it be a proper name at all, means the whole Peloponnesus,"
13654,SECT. VIII.,"and not a part of it, for Nestor in Il. i. 270 uses it so as to include"
13655,SECT. VIII.,"the Western side, and Hector, Il. iii. 49, so as to include the Eastern."
13656,SECT. VIII.,
13657,SECT. VIII.,_Geographical definitions._
13658,SECT. VIII.,
13659,SECT. VIII.,I will now sum up the conclusions to which this inquiry has brought
13660,SECT. VIII.,"us, either by certain or by probable evidence, with respect to Homer’s"
13661,SECT. VIII.,"geographical nomenclature for Greece at large, and for its principal"
13662,SECT. VIII.,members.
13663,SECT. VIII.,
13664,SECT. VIII.,1. Ἀχαïὶς       }
13665,SECT. VIII.,Ἀχαïὶς γαῖα  }  invariably mean the whole of Greece.
13666,SECT. VIII.,Ἀχαιῒς αἶα   }
13667,SECT. VIII.,
13668,SECT. VIII.,"2. Ἄργος either alone, or with epithets other than those which concern"
13669,SECT. VIII.,"geographical extension, means"
13670,SECT. VIII.,
13671,SECT. VIII.,"(1) The city only, as in Il. iv. 52, and probably in Il. ii. 559."
13672,SECT. VIII.,
13673,SECT. VIII.,(2) The immediate dominions of Agamemnon in the north and north-east
13674,SECT. VIII.,"of Peloponnesus, as in Od. iii. 263."
13675,SECT. VIII.,
13676,SECT. VIII.,"But it is possible, though by no means certain, that Ἄργος in this"
13677,SECT. VIII.,"sense should be held to include the whole Pelopid dominions, which"
13678,SECT. VIII.,"were looked upon as having a certain political unity, and thus to be"
13679,SECT. VIII.,the equivalent of Ἄργος Ἀχαιïκόν.
13680,SECT. VIII.,
13681,SECT. VIII.,"(3) By metonymy from this supreme and metropolitan quarter of Greece,"
13682,SECT. VIII.,it means the whole country.
13683,SECT. VIII.,
13684,SECT. VIII.,3. The phrase πᾶν Ἄργος in Il. ii. 108 means the whole of Continental
13685,SECT. VIII.,Greece.
13686,SECT. VIII.,
13687,SECT. VIII.,"4. The phrase μέσον Ἄργος means most probably the whole of Greece, or"
13688,SECT. VIII.,Greece at large; possibly the Peloponnesus only.
13689,SECT. VIII.,
13690,SECT. VIII.,"5. Πελασγικὸν Ἄργος is Thessaly, from Macedonia to Œta."
13691,SECT. VIII.,
13692,SECT. VIII.,"6. Ἀχαιïκὸν Ἄργος means the Pelopid dominions of the Troic time, or in"
13693,SECT. VIII.,"general words, Eastern Peloponnesus."
13694,SECT. VIII.,
13695,SECT. VIII.,7. Ἴασον Ἄργος means Western Peloponnesus.
13696,SECT. VIII.,
13697,SECT. VIII.,8. The word Ἕλλας means
13698,SECT. VIII.,
13699,SECT. VIII.,"(1) probably a portion of the dominions of Achilles, as in Il. ii."
13700,SECT. VIII.,"683, ix. 395;"
13701,SECT. VIII.,
13702,SECT. VIII.,"(2) certainly the country outside them to the southward of Phthia,"
13703,SECT. VIII.,"down to the Isthmus of Corinth, and probably reaching northward"
13704,SECT. VIII.,through the rest of Thessaly: Il. ix. 447 and elsewhere;
13705,SECT. VIII.,
13706,SECT. VIII.,"(3) it is possible that Ἕλλας may mean all Greece in Od. i. 344, and"
13707,SECT. VIII.,xv. 80; but more likely that the sense is the same as in (2).
13708,SECT. VIII.,
13709,SECT. VIII.,"9. The phrase Ἀπίη γαίη most probably, though not certainly, means the"
13710,SECT. VIII.,entire Peloponnesus.
13711,SECT. VIII.,
13712,SECT. VIII.,"What then was this name Ἄργος, which Homer uses so much more"
13713,SECT. VIII.,"frequently, and with so much more elasticity and diversity of sense,"
13714,SECT. VIII.,than any other territorial name whatever?
13715,SECT. VIII.,
13716,SECT. VIII.,In the first place let us remark how rarely it is used for a city; in
13717,SECT. VIII.,"the strict sense of the word, we cannot be said to find it more than"
13718,SECT. VIII.,once. Its proper meaning is evidently a tract of country.
13719,SECT. VIII.,
13720,SECT. VIII.,From this it is limited to the city to which the tract of country
13721,SECT. VIII.,"belonged: or it is extended to the country at large, of which the"
13722,SECT. VIII.,particular tract was the capital or governing part. Both these
13723,SECT. VIII.,significations are what are termed improper: the latter is also
13724,SECT. VIII.,"political, and has no relation to race, or to an eponymist, or to any"
13725,SECT. VIII.,"physical features of soil or scenery, whether the word Ἄργος may have"
13726,SECT. VIII.,"had such reference or not, when used in its original, proper, and usual"
13727,SECT. VIII.,"application, to mean a district."
13728,SECT. VIII.,
13729,SECT. VIII.,"As previously with populations, let us now set out the various"
13730,SECT. VIII.,"descriptions of source, to which the Homeric names of countries and"
13731,SECT. VIII.,places owe their origin.
13732,SECT. VIII.,
13733,SECT. VIII.,They appear to be derived either
13734,SECT. VIII.,
13735,SECT. VIII.,"1. From an individual eponymist, as Ithaca from Ithacus, Od. xvii. 207;"
13736,SECT. VIII.,"Dardania from Dardanus, Il. xx. 216; Ascanie from Ascanius, Il. ii."
13737,SECT. VIII.,863; while we see the intermediate stage of the process in the name
13738,SECT. VIII.,"Ἀπίη, joined with γαῖα, supposed to indicate the Peloponnesus, and to"
13739,SECT. VIII.,be derived from Apis.
13740,SECT. VIII.,
13741,SECT. VIII.,2. From a race in occupation: as in the case of Ἀχαïὶς γαῖα and Ἀχαïὶς
13742,SECT. VIII.,"simply, from the Achæans; Ἕλλας from the Ἕλλοι; Κρήτη or Κρηταὶ (Od."
13743,SECT. VIII.,xiv. 199) from the Κρῆτες.
13744,SECT. VIII.,
13745,SECT. VIII.,"3. From its physical features or circumstances directly, such as"
13746,SECT. VIII.,Αἰγίαλος from being a narrow strip along the shore of the Corinthian
13747,SECT. VIII.,"gulf, between the mountains and the sea: there is also a town Αἰγίαλος"
13748,SECT. VIII.,"of the Paphlagonians, Il. ii. 855. Probably we may add Εὔβοια, Eubœa,"
13749,SECT. VIII.,"from the adaptation of that fertile island to tillage, which afterwards"
13750,SECT. VIII.,made it the granary of Athens.
13751,SECT. VIII.,
13752,SECT. VIII.,4. From some race occupying it: and in the cases where that race has
13753,SECT. VIII.,"been named from any feature of the country, then, not directly but"
13754,SECT. VIII.,"derivatively, from the country itself."
13755,SECT. VIII.,
13756,SECT. VIII.,"For instance, Θρῄκη from Θρῇκες, Thracians, which word again must come"
13757,SECT. VIII.,from a common root with τρᾶχυς. The name Τρηχῖν has obviously a similar
13758,SECT. VIII.,origin.
13759,SECT. VIII.,
13760,SECT. VIII.,So again in the later Greek we find the old Αἰγίαλος named Αἰγιάλεια
13761,SECT. VIII.,from the intermediate formation Αἰγιαλεῖς: and perhaps Ἄργολις from
13762,SECT. VIII.,"the Ἀργεῖοι, who inhabited it, and took their name from Ἄργος."
13763,SECT. VIII.,
13764,SECT. VIII.,"And so in Homer we have Φθίη; from that apparently comes Φθῖοι, and"
13765,SECT. VIII.,"from this again, in the later Greek, Phthiotis."
13766,SECT. VIII.,
13767,SECT. VIII.,"Such then are the ordinary sources, as far as we know, of the"
13768,SECT. VIII.,territorial names of Homer.
13769,SECT. VIII.,
13770,SECT. VIII.,The three aids which we have for judging of the meaning of the name
13771,SECT. VIII.,"Ἄργος are, the Homeric text, etymology, and the later tradition."
13772,SECT. VIII.,
13773,SECT. VIII.,_Etymology of the word Argos._
13774,SECT. VIII.,
13775,SECT. VIII.,None of these in any manner connect the name Ἄργος either with
13776,SECT. VIII.,"an eponymist, or with a race of inhabitants, either mediately or"
13777,SECT. VIII.,"immediately, as its root. We can only therefore look for its origin"
13778,SECT. VIII.,"in something related to the physical features of the country, or"
13779,SECT. VIII.,"countries, to which it was applied."
13780,SECT. VIII.,
13781,SECT. VIII.,The word ἄργος itself is frequently found in Homer otherwise than as a
13782,SECT. VIII.,proper name. It is used as an adjective in the following combinations:
13783,SECT. VIII.,
13784,SECT. VIII.,1. κύνες ἀργοὶ Il. i. 50.
13785,SECT. VIII.,
13786,SECT. VIII.,2. βόες ἀργοὶ Il. xxiii. 30.
13787,SECT. VIII.,
13788,SECT. VIII.,3. ἀργὴν χῆνα Od. xv. 161.
13789,SECT. VIII.,
13790,SECT. VIII.,"So also we have the compounds ἀργὴς (κέραυνος) ἀργικέραυνος, ἀργεστὴς"
13791,SECT. VIII.,"(Νότος), ἀργενναὶ (ὀΐες, ὀθόναι), ἀργινόεις (Κάμειρος), ἀργιόδοντες"
13792,SECT. VIII.,"(ὕες), ἀργιπόδες (κύνες), Ποδάργης (horse of Achilles)."
13793,SECT. VIII.,
13794,SECT. VIII.,And it is usual to give to the word ἀργὸς[662] in these several forms
13795,SECT. VIII.,the several senses of
13796,SECT. VIII.,
13797,SECT. VIII.,"1. Swift, as in swift dogs, swift thunderbolt."
13798,SECT. VIII.,
13799,SECT. VIII.,"2. White, as in white goose, white (chalky) Cameirus."
13800,SECT. VIII.,
13801,SECT. VIII.,"3. Sleek, shining, as in sleek oxen, with glistening coats."
13802,SECT. VIII.,
13803,SECT. VIII.,"It is said truly, that what is swift in motion gives an appearance"
13804,SECT. VIII.,of shining: and what shines is in some degree akin to whiteness.
13805,SECT. VIII.,"But it is neither easy to say, in this view of the matter, which is"
13806,SECT. VIII.,"the primary, and which the secondary, meaning of the word, nor what"
13807,SECT. VIII.,is its etymology. Nor does it show the slightest resemblance to the
13808,SECT. VIII.,"local name Ἄργος, which, from the variety of its applications, apart"
13809,SECT. VIII.,"from any question of race or political connection, must have had some"
13810,SECT. VIII.,etymological signification.
13811,SECT. VIII.,
13812,SECT. VIII.,"Nor, as regards the βόες ἀργοὶ in particular, is it very easy to"
13813,SECT. VIII.,"believe in the sleekness of the oxen in Homer’s time, (this seems to"
13814,SECT. VIII.,be rather an idea borrowed from the processes and experience of modern
13815,SECT. VIII.,"times,) or of the camp oxen of any time. Nor is the matter mended by"
13816,SECT. VIII.,"two forced attempts, one to construe βόες ἀργοὶ as oxen having white"
13817,SECT. VIII.,"fat within them, or again, as slow oxen. From these sources, then, we"
13818,SECT. VIII.,can at present obtain no light.
13819,SECT. VIII.,
13820,SECT. VIII.,Now I submit that the just signification of the proper name Ἄργος is
13821,SECT. VIII.,"to be found by considering it as akin to the word ἔργον, which plainly"
13822,SECT. VIII.,appears in Homer to have agricultural labours for its primary object.
13823,SECT. VIII.,"And it seems pretty clear, that by the transposition of letters which"
13824,SECT. VIII.,"so commonly occurs in popular speech, especially during the infant"
13825,SECT. VIII.,"state of languages, the word ἄγρος, ‘a field,’ is no more than a form"
13826,SECT. VIII.,of Ἄργος.
13827,SECT. VIII.,
13828,SECT. VIII.,"K. O. Müller, as we have seen, considers that Ἄργος with the ancients"
13829,SECT. VIII.,"means a plain[663]: I would add a plain, not as being a flat surface,"
13830,SECT. VIII.,"but as being formed of cultivable ground, or else it means a"
13831,SECT. VIII.,settlement formed upon such ground.
13832,SECT. VIII.,
13833,SECT. VIII.,"In speaking of the word _plain_ as applied to Greece, we use it"
13834,SECT. VIII.,"relatively, not as it would be employed in reference to Russia or"
13835,SECT. VIII.,"Hungary, but as meaning the broader levels between the hills, and"
13836,SECT. VIII.,commonly towards the sea: such as those valleys of Scotland which are
13837,SECT. VIII.,"called _carses_, or those called _straths_."
13838,SECT. VIII.,
13839,SECT. VIII.,Now in the first place I know no other meaning of the word Ἄργος which
13840,SECT. VIII.,"will suit its various uses in Homer as Pelasgic Argos, Achaic Argos,"
13841,SECT. VIII.,Iasian Argos. What is the one common physical feature of the several
13842,SECT. VIII.,regions that accounts for the common factor in these three compound
13843,SECT. VIII.,"expressions, if it be not that of plain, that is to say, cultivable,"
13844,SECT. VIII.,"and cultivated, or settled country?"
13845,SECT. VIII.,
13846,SECT. VIII.,"Again, look at the relation of Ἄργος to Ἀργεῖοι. What except a physical"
13847,SECT. VIII.,"and geographical meaning, still adhering to the word, and holding"
13848,SECT. VIII.,"it somewhat short of the mature and familiar use of a proper name,"
13849,SECT. VIII.,can account for the fact that we have in the history and geography
13850,SECT. VIII.,"of Greece so many cases of an Argos, without Argives, that is local"
13851,SECT. VIII.,"or provincial Argives, belonging to it? Achaic Argos indeed has"
13852,SECT. VIII.,"Ἀργεῖοι belonging to it, but Pelasgic and Iasian Argos have none."
13853,SECT. VIII.,"Just so we might speak of the Highlands of Saxony, or of the Lowlands"
13854,SECT. VIII.,of Switzerland; but the inhabitants of the first are not known as
13855,SECT. VIII.,"Highlanders, nor those of the latter as Lowlanders[664]."
13856,SECT. VIII.,
13857,SECT. VIII.,"I believe there are no phrases, which more nearly translate the words"
13858,SECT. VIII.,"Ἄργος and Ἀργεῖοι, than Lowlands and Lowlanders respectively. For"
13859,SECT. VIII.,"the word Lowlands means land not only lying low, but both lying low,"
13860,SECT. VIII.,and also being favourable for cultivation: and these ideas more truly
13861,SECT. VIII.,"represent the land fitted for the sort of settlement called Ἄργος, than"
13862,SECT. VIII.,the mere idea of level plains.
13863,SECT. VIII.,
13864,SECT. VIII.,"If this be the idea of the word Argos, we see the propriety of its"
13865,SECT. VIII.,"application to the city of Argos and its district. For this city stood,"
13866,SECT. VIII.,"as a city of the town and more open country, in a certain opposition to"
13867,SECT. VIII.,"Mycenæ, which nestled among the hills; and which bore geographically"
13868,SECT. VIII.,"much the same relation to Argos, as Dardania to Ilion. It afterwards"
13869,SECT. VIII.,fell also into the same political analogy.
13870,SECT. VIII.,
13871,SECT. VIII.,"In the phrase Ἀχαιïκὸν Ἄργος, Homer deals with a case where, as it is"
13872,SECT. VIII.,"sometimes applied without an epithet, Ἄργος may justly be called a"
13873,SECT. VIII.,"proper name, like the European _Pays-bas_; but there is no evidence of"
13874,SECT. VIII.,"this in his ‘Pelasgic Argos,’ and ‘Iasian Argos,’ and it seems likely"
13875,SECT. VIII.,that he rather intends in those phrases to employ the term Argos as a
13876,SECT. VIII.,"word simply descriptive, and to speak of the Pelasgian Lowlands, and"
13877,SECT. VIII.,the Iasian Lowlands. The difference of sense is just that which we
13878,SECT. VIII.,should indicate in English by the absence of the capital letter.
13879,SECT. VIII.,
13880,SECT. VIII.,There is evidence that the name had not exhausted its elasticity even
13881,SECT. VIII.,after Homer’s time. In later ages we find an Argos of Orestis in
13882,SECT. VIII.,Macedonia; an Argos of Amphilochia in Western Greece; an Argos near
13883,SECT. VIII.,"Larissa in Thessaly[665], and other cases more remote. Nothing but a"
13884,SECT. VIII.,geographical force still adhering to the word will account for this
13885,SECT. VIII.,extension.
13886,SECT. VIII.,
13887,SECT. VIII.,The same is the inference to be drawn from the epithets and
13888,SECT. VIII.,"quasi-epithets, or descriptive phrases, applied to it by Homer."
13889,SECT. VIII.,"With the exception of one passage, where he gives it the political"
13890,SECT. VIII.,"epithet[666] κλυτὸν, they are all physical; being ἱππόβοτον,"

13892,SECT. VIII.,first is in Homer peculiarly connected with the specific form and

13894,SECT. VIII.,"of Argos, being used with it eleven times out of only fifteen in which"
13895,SECT. VIII.,"the word has any epithet or quasi-epithet attached to it, it is never"
13896,SECT. VIII.,"found with Achæis, or with Hellas. And the proof of its physically"
13897,SECT. VIII.,descriptive character lies in the passage where Telemachus gives to
13898,SECT. VIII.,Menelaus an account of Ithaca;

13903,SECT. VIII.,"The ἱππόβοτος of Homer, again, does not point merely to fertility, but"
13904,SECT. VIII.,"also to labour and its results; not merely to pasture, but also to"

13909,SECT. VIII.,"Now, in referring the word Ἄργος to a common root and significancy with"
13910,SECT. VIII.,"ἔργον, we are not bound to hold that it attains its initial vowel by"

13923,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,older date than any other which has either been brought in copy from
13924,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Greece, or is to be found on the marbles. The matter of it is a public"

13927,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
13928,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Another good example of the interchange of the vowels α and ε is in
13929,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the word ἀρόω, which it is obvious to derive from ἔρα, the earth. In"
13930,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Latin we see both forms preserved, the one in _aro_ to plough, the"
13931,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,other in _sero_ to sow. And this latter suggests the derivation of the
13932,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Greek σπείρω from a similar source.

13934,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"If then the meaning of Ἄργος be an agricultural settlement, and its"

13937,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to be probable, and which accounts both for the especial reference"

13943,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
13944,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Now, having this view of the words Ἄργος and ἔργον, we shall find, in"
13945,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the fundamental idea of labour itself, a meaning which will furnish"
13946,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"a basis for the Homeric adjective, and for all its compounds in all"
13947,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,their varied applications. That idea is always in relation with what is
13948,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"earnest, and (so to speak) strengthful; sometimes this takes the form"
13949,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of keenness, and then comes in the idea of swiftness in conjunction"
13950,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"with labour: sometimes, again, it takes the form of patience, and then"
13951,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"labour suggests slowness. The labour of a dog is swift, that of an ox"
13952,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"is patient: hence the κύνες ἄργοι are laborious dogs, therefore swift;"
13953,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"and hence too the βόες ἄργοι are laborious oxen, therefore slow; the"
13954,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"office of the one being to cover space, and of the other to overcome"
13955,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,resistance. We may bring the two senses near without any loss in either
13956,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"case, by calling the oxen sturdy or sedulous, and the dogs strenuous or"
13957,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,keen.

13959,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,The third sense of whiteness legitimately attaches to the effect of

13961,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
13962,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,The sense of sleekness does not appear to be required in Homer: but it
13963,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,may be a derivative from that of whiteness.
13964,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
13965,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"By one or more of the three first senses, or by the original sense of"
13966,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"labour in its (so to speak) integral idea, all the Homeric words may be"
13967,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"justly rendered. Some of them will bear either the sense of swift, or"
13968,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"that of white: for instance, ἀργὴς with κεραυνός. In Aristotle[671],"
13969,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"de Mundo, c. 4, we have τῶν κεραυνῶν ... οἱ ταχέως διάττοντες, ἀργῆτες"
13970,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"λέγονται. And again, ἀργεστὴς with Νότος. This may mean the fleet"
13971,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Notus: it may also mean white, as carrying the light white cloud from"
13972,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"over the sea, in the sense taken by Horace, who appears to have been an"
13973,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"accurate and careful observer of Homeric epithets; and who says,"

13977,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
13978,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,This sense of the word Argos will suit other uses of it which have not
13979,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,been yet named.
13980,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
13981,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"For instance, it will suit the ship Argo, which we may consider as"
13982,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"swift, or, and perhaps preferably, as stout, strong, doing battle"
13983,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"with the waves: as we now say, a good ship, or a gallant ship. Again,"
13984,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"it suits the noble dog Argus of the Odyssey, whose character would"
13985,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"be but inadequately represented by either patient, swift, or white."
13986,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Considering this word as the adjective of the word which describes what
13987,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"has been well called by a writer of the present day, “noble, fruitful"
13988,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"labour,” we at once see him before us, swift as he had been, and"
13989,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"patient as he was, but also brave, faithful, trustful, and trustworthy."
13990,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Argus the spy, named in the Ἀργειφόντης of Homer, represents one"
13991,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"side of the early meaning of the word[673]. The adjective ἀργαλέος,"
13992,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,exaggerating as well as isolating that element of difficulty which the
13993,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"root comprises, represents another: and the later word ἀργοῦντες[674],"
13994,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the idle, catching the idea of slowness at the point where it passes"
13995,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"into inertness, similarly represents yet another."
13996,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
13997,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Such being the case in regard to the name Ἄργος, we shall now have an"

13999,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14000,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Homer employs this word in four places (to speak in round numbers) for
14001,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,three in which he uses Δαναοί.
14002,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14003,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"He employs it as an epithet, sometimes with the name of Juno, and"
14004,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,frequently with the name of Helen.

14007,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14008,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,In the Odyssey[675] we have this singular and rare juxtaposition of the
14009,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,words:
14010,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14011,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Ἀργείων Δαναῶν ἠδ’ Ἰλίου οἶτον ἀκούων.
14012,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14013,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Nitzsch[676] observes, that we might almost suppose the word Ἀργείων"
14014,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to be an epithet, and this observation is quoted by G. Crusius."
14015,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Eustathius, the Scholiast, Barnes, Payne Knight, do not notice it."
14016,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,It seems to me more agreeable to Homeric laws to treat Ἀργείων as the
14017,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"substantive, and Δαναῶν as the adjective. For as Homer knows of an"
14018,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Achaic, an Iasian, a Pelasgic Argos, so he may consistently speak of"
14019,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Danaan Argives, with the latent idea that there might be, and were,"
14020,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"other Lowlanders out of Greece. But there were not, so far as we know,"
14021,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,any other Danaans than a single Greek dynasty.
14022,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14023,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Homer also in other places uses Δαναοὶ[677] as an adjective, with"
14024,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the substantives ἥρωες and αἰχμηταί. He has no corresponding use of
14025,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Ἀργεῖοι: thus the old idea of a _colonus_ or farming settler seems
14026,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"still to colour the word, and lingers in it, even after it has grown to"
14027,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,be in common use a proper name.
14028,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14029,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"In the application of the word Ἀργείη as an epithet to Juno and Helen,"
14030,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"he appears not to mean simply Greek but Argive Juno, Argive Helen, so"
14031,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,that the word here is not properly the singular of Ἀργεῖοι the national
14032,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"name, but simply the adjective formed from Ἄργος, in the sense of that"
14033,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,part of Peloponnesus which formed the Pelopid dominions. To these Helen
14034,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"belonged: and for that family, as previously for the Perseid race, Juno"
14035,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"felt her chief anxiety, evidently because they were the political heads"
14036,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of Greece.
14037,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14038,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Thus the use of Argeian as an adjective seems to be quite clearly
14039,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"limited to a local sense of the word: and this being the case, it seems"
14040,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,remarkable that the attention of the commentators before Nitzsch should
14041,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"not have been directed to the line in the Eighth Odyssey, and that"
14042,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Nitzsch, with ἥρωες Δαναοὶ and αἰχμηταὶ Δαναοὶ to guide him, should"
14043,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"suggest the sense of Argive Danaans, instead of Danaan Argives."
14044,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14045,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The local use, however, of the Argeian name must not be dismissed"
14046,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,without a more full investigation. Let us first dispose of its use for
14047,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Juno and Helen.
14048,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14049,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The proof that Helen is meant to be described as not merely Greek, but"
14050,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"as connected with Achaic Argos or Eastern Peloponnesus, has already"
14051,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,been sufficiently[678] set forth.
14052,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14053,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"As respects Juno, we shall find that her affections always centre in"
14054,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the house that was paramount in the chief seat of Hellenic power, the"
14055,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Eastern Peloponnesus. Her tenacious attachments are constantly directed
14056,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to the nation, and they survive dynastic changes. Hence her keen and"
14057,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"venturesome feeling for Eurystheus; her never dying, never sleeping"
14058,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,hatred to his rival Hercules; her esteem for Agamemnon equally with
14059,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Achilles[679], though they were so unequal in fame and valour: perhaps"
14060,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,suggesting that Achilles was regarded by her either because he was
14061,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"necessary for the purposes of Agamemnon, or because he was closely"
14062,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"allied to the chief Achæan stock[680]. Hence it is that, when he has"
14063,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"assumed his arms[681], she thunders in his honour: and hence her"
14064,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"especial love for the three cities, which were the symbols of Greek"
14065,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"power, Argos, Sparta, and Mycenæ[682]. So intense is her attachment,"
14066,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"that she could wish to be the actual mother of the Greeks, even as she"
14067,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"would readily devour the Trojans upon occasion[683]. Hence, once more,"
14068,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"even in the Odyssey, where she is almost a mute, it is mentioned, that"
14069,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Agamemnon[684] came safe across the sea, for Juno protected him. This"
14070,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"is quite enough to fix the sense of Ἀργείη, when it is applied to Juno,"
14071,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,as a local sense.
14072,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14073,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"In fact, Homer’s use of this word with a restrained and local sense is"
14074,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"not only clear, but most carefully defined, both as to time and as to"
14075,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,place.
14076,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14077,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"While in the army before Troy he freely interchanges Danaan, Argive,"
14078,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"and Achæan, as they are near enough to identity for his purpose, he"
14079,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"never applies Danaan at all to the Greeks at home, and employs the"
14080,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,other two names with the most accurate discrimination.

14083,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14084,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The Argeian name is confined in place to the Eastern Peloponnesus, and"
14085,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,in time to the Perseid epoch. Upon the transfer of the sovereignty
14086,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to the Pelopid house, the Argeian name ceases to be applied to their"
14087,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,immediate subjects. Let us now examine passages which may illustrate
14088,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the case.
14089,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14090,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"1. Two or nearly three generations before the _Troica_, in the time"
14091,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"when Bellerophon was young, Prœtus ruled over the Ἀργεῖοι,"
14092,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14093,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,πολὺ φέρτερος ἦεν
14094,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Ἀργείων· Ζεὺς γὰρ οἱ ὑπὸ σκηπτρῷ ἐδάμασσεν[685].
14095,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14096,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Now Prœtus was certainly not lord of Greece. There was no lord
14097,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,paramount of Greece before the Pelopids: and near the time of Prœtus we
14098,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"have Eurystheus, Œneus and his line, Cadmus and his line, Neleus and"
14099,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"his line, Minos and his line, as well as probably other thrones, each"
14100,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in its own place. But Prœtus falls within the period of the Perseids,"
14101,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,and within the local circumscription of the Eastern Peloponnesus where
14102,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,they reigned.
14103,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14104,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,2. But neither is Eurystheus spoken of by Homer as sovereign of Greece;
14105,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"though he is king of the Argives[686],"
14106,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14107,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,ὃς Ἀργείοισιν ἀνάξει.
14108,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14109,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,For when Juno fraudulently asks and obtains from Jupiter the promise
14110,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"that the person to be born that day shall enjoy a certain sovereignty,"
14111,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"it is not over the Argives, but over the περικτίονες:"
14112,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14113,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,ἦ μὲν τὸν πάντεσσι περικτιόνεσσιν ἀνάξειν
14114,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,ὅς κεν ἐπ’ ἤματι τῷδε πέσῃ μετὰ ποσσὶ γυναικός.
14115,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14116,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Thus the promise is the babe shall reign over περικτίονες, a word"
14117,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"clearly inapplicable to the whole of that straggling territory, which"
14118,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,was occupied irregularly by the Greeks. But when the fulfilment is
14119,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"claimed, it is that he shall reign over Ἀργεῖοι. Therefore the two"
14120,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"names are coextensive, and accordingly Ἀργεῖοι does not mean all"
14121,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Greeks; for example, it does not include the line of Cadmus then ruling"
14122,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,in Bœotia.

14124,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"3. But we come down to the time of Tydeus, who was lord of Argos during"
14125,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the epoch of the Pelopid sovereigns. And now we find that his subjects
14126,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"cease to be called Ἀργεῖοι (see Il. v. 803. iv. 384) in the legends,"
14127,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,where Homer observes a peculiar nicety in the application of these
14128,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,important words.

14130,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,_Local sense of the former name retained._
14131,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14132,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,4. Still the Argeian name continues to preserve its local application
14133,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to the inhabitants of Argos and its district, or of Achaic Argos."
14134,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14135,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"At the games on the death of Patroclus, Idomeneus thinks he discerns"
14136,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Diomed coming in as the winner, and he describes him thus:"
14137,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14138,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,δοκέει δέ μοι ἔμμεναι ἀνὴρ
14139,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Αἴτωλος γενέην, μετὰ δ’ Ἀργείοισιν ἀνάσσει[687]."
14140,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14141,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"It is plain that here Idomeneus means among Argives, and not among"
14142,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Greeks.
14143,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14144,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"1. Because not Diomed was lord among the Greeks, but Agamemnon."
14145,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14146,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,2. Because Diomed was lord over a part of the Argives.
14147,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14148,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"3. Because the word is used in evident contradistinction to, and"
14149,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"correspondence with, the foregoing word Αἴτωλος, which is undoubtedly"
14150,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,local.
14151,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14152,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Again, when we are told that Orestes made a funeral feast for the"
14153,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ἀργεῖοι[688], we may probably presume that we have here again the local"
14154,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,sense.
14155,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14156,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Thus we see plainly enough the history of the rise of the Argive name.
14157,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Belonging to the subjects of the ruling part of Greece, it grows so as"
14158,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to be applicable to all Greeks, in cases where no confusion can arise"
14159,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,from its being thus employed. Thus the Roman name became applicable
14160,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to Campanians or Calabrians as subjects of Rome, in contradistinction"
14161,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to Germans, Dacians, or Parthians; but if the subject in hand were"
14162,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"domestic and Italian, the domestic distinction would naturally revive."
14163,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Even so Homer’s Greeks are all Argeians in the _Troica_: but at home
14164,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"they have their local meaning, like Cadmeans, Ætolians, Pylians,"
14165,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Elians, Epeans, Arcadians, Locrians, and also, as we shall find,"
14166,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Achæans.
14167,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14168,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"It is at the very period of the local prevalence of the Argive name,"
14169,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,that we find also from Homer unequivocal appearances of a Cretan
14170,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"empire, circumscribing it by sea, and possibly more or less by"
14171,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"land, though perhaps the Minoan power and dynasty may not at once"
14172,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"have acquired its Grecian character. If then, with respect to the"
14173,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"word Ἀργεῖοι, we see that it was originally of limited and local"
14174,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,application; we have no reason whatever to suppose that the Danaan name
14175,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,could ever have been of wider scope. Two questions then arise.
14176,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14177,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"First, why does Homer use the Danaan and Argive names as national, when"
14178,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,they were only local?
14179,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14180,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Secondly, the priority of the Danaan name being clear, as we see"
14181,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,that the Danaan dynasty preceded that one whose subjects were called
14182,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Argives, why did the Argive name supplant or succeed the Danaan?"
14183,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14184,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The first question will be resumed hereafter, but I will now touch upon"
14185,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the second.
14186,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14187,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The name Danaan, in all likelihood, was that of a dynasty originating"
14188,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"beyond seas; and if so, it could not well, until softened by the mellow"
14189,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"haze of distance, be more popular with the Greeks, when they had"
14190,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,awakened under Hellic influence to a full consciousness of national
14191,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"life, than it would have been with the English in the last century to"
14192,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,be called Hanoverians or Brunswickers.

14194,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The Danaid line ceased, when Perseus came to the throne, as he was"
14195,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,descended on the father’s side from another source.
14196,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14197,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Nothing could be more natural, than that with this change of dynasty"
14198,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,an old and merely dynastic name should disappear. But why should it be
14199,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,succeeded by the name Ἀργεῖοι?

14241,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14242,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Let us compare with it the Latin word _agrestis_. This I take to be
14243,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"precisely similar, indeed identical, etymologically, with Ἀργεῖος."
14244,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The point of divergence is when Ἄργος by transposition becomes ἀγρὸς,"
14245,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,whence are _ager_ and _agrestis_. Materially this Latin word is in

14247,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ideally, it passes through the very same process as has been shown in"

14252,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"This name we find not only as an adjective, but likewise as a proper"

14261,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ἀργεῖος, and in the opposite direction, comes to mean uneducated,"

14290,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"serpent, either generally or of some particular kind, had, it seems,"
14291,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the name of Ἀργὰς, which we can easily derive from ἄργος, taken in the"
14292,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,same sense as that in which it became the name of Argus the spy. ‘Now
14293,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field[691].’ But
14294,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,this does not seem to satisfy the intention of the highly vituperative

14296,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,would not have been perhaps a very effective one in Greece. I think he

14310,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,distinct from the explanation respecting that select and trusted
14311,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"class of Helots, who were called Ἀργεῖοι. This usage both serves to"
14312,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"explain history, and is explained by it. Ἀργεῖοι was the name of the"
14313,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Greek citizen in Eastern Peloponnesus under the Perseids; it appears
14314,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,in part to have retained its local force throughout the period of the
14315,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Pelopids; for though in the legend of Tydeus the inhabitants of Argolis
14316,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"we at least find the name Ἀχαιοὶ among them, yet in the Twenty-third"
14317,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Iliad, and in the Third Odyssey, they are called Ἀργεῖοι. In the local"
14318,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"usage, then, the Helot meaning a serf, the emancipated Helot would be"
14319,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"a citizen, an Ἀργεῖος. But neither serfship nor citizenship were in"
14320,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"those days rigidly defined, and the one ran into the other. What could"
14321,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"under such circumstances be more natural, than that any Helot who was"

14324,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ἀργεῖος, and, that the class who had thus obtained it in a somewhat"
14325,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"peculiar sense, that is to say, the sense of a free rural settler, or"
14326,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"(so to speak) freeholder, should continue to bear it as descriptive of"
14327,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"their own position, even when it had ceased to be generally applicable"
14328,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,to the free Greeks of that particular district? which of course it
14329,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,could no longer be when the family and dynastic tie between Argolis and

14346,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"was a period in which the Greeks were as a nation called Ἀργεῖοι, a"
14347,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,supposition which seems to me improbable: or whether it was a name
14348,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"which Homer applied to them poetically, like the name Δαναοὶ, because"
14349,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,it had once been the proper designation of those who held the seat
14350,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of Greek supremacy. In either view, however, the case of the name"
14351,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ἄργος is different. That name had not its root in political power,"
14352,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"actual or remembered: it kept its place, as being founded in a good"
14353,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"physical description, so far as it went, of the general character of"
14354,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the principal habitable parts of the peninsula which the Hellic tribes,"
14355,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"swarming downwards from their hills, successively and gradually"
14356,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"occupied. Hence the substantive was, as we see, capable of spreading"
14357,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"beyond the adjective in space, since, while we have an Iasian and a"
14358,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Pelasgian Ἄργος, we have no Iasian or Pelasgian Ἀργεῖοι. Thus they were"
14359,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,detached one from the other. In Homer the epithet has a larger range
14360,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of clear signification than the substantive. But apart from Homer the
14361,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"substantive appears from etymology to have been the older, and from"
14362,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,history either to have reached points at which the adjective never
14363,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"arrived, or to have long survived its desuetude."

14377,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14378,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"1. That of the three great appellatives of the nation, the name Ἀχαιοὶ"
14379,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,is the most familiar.
14380,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14381,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,2. That the manner of its national use indicates the political
14382,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"predominance of an Achæan race, in the Homeric age, over other races,"
14383,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"ranged by its side in the Troic enterprise, and composing along with it"
14384,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the nation, which owned Agamemnon for its head."
14385,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14386,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"3. That, besides its national use, the name Ἀχαιοὶ has also an"
14387,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,important local and particular use for a race which had spread through
14388,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Greece, and which exercised sway among its population."
14389,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14390,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,4. That the manner of its local and particular use points out to
14391,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"us, with considerable clearness, the epoch at which it acquired"
14392,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"preponderance, namely that when Pelops and his family acquired"
14393,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,ascendancy in Greece.
14394,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14395,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"As respects the first of these propositions, the numerical test,"
14396,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"although a rude one, yet appears to be conclusive. We find that Homer"
14397,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"uses the name Ἀργεῖοι in the plural two hundred and five times, of"
14398,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,which twenty-eight are in the Odyssey; besides fifteen passages in
14399,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,which the singular is used. And the name Δαναοὶ about one hundred and
14400,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"sixty times, of which thirteen are in the Odyssey. But we find the name"
14401,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ἀχαιοὶ, employed from seven to eight hundred times: that is to say,"
14402,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"five hundred and ninety-seven times in the Iliad, and one hundred and"
14403,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"seventeen times in the Odyssey; all these in the plural number, besides"
14404,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"thirty-two places of the poems in which it is used in the singular, or"
14405,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,in its derivatives Ἀχαίïς or Ἀχαιïκός.
14406,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14407,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,The particulars next to be stated will bear at once upon the first and
14408,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,upon the second proposition.
14409,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14410,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Homer very rarely attaches any epithet to the name Ἀργεῖοι, more"
14411,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"frequently by much to Δαναοὶ, and still oftener to Ἀχαιοί. To the first"
14412,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,only six times in all: to the second twenty-four: and to the third near
14413,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,one hundred and forty times. It is not likely that metrical convenience
14414,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,is the cause of this diversity. We have already seen that Ἀργεῖοι is
14415,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"susceptible of a substantive force, which will carry one at least of"
14416,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the other names by way of epithet, as if it indicated an employment,"
14417,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,and not properly the name of a race. A like inference may be drawn from
14418,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the greater susceptibility of carrying descriptive epithets, which we"
14419,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"now find the Danaan and Achæan names evince. For example, the name of"
14420,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Scotts, Douglasses, or Grahams, four centuries ago, would have"
14421,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,afforded larger scope for characteristic epithets than such a name as
14422,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Farmers or Colonists, when used to point out a particular people, or"
14423,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"than such a name as Lowlanders, while it still retained its descriptive"
14424,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"character, and had not yet become purely titular or proper. We must"
14425,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"probably look, then, to political significance for the basis of the use"
14426,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,made by Homer of the Achæan name.
14427,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14428,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"When we examine the character of the epithets, this presumption is"
14429,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"greatly corroborated. Homer uses with the word Ἀχαιοὶ, and with this"
14430,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"word only, epithets indicating, firstly, high spirit, secondly,"
14431,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"personal beauty, and thirdly, finished armour[693]. I take these to be"
14432,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of themselves sufficient signs, even were others wanting, to point to"
14433,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Achæans as being properly the ruling class, or aristocracy, of the"
14434,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,heroic age.
14435,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14436,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The Achæan name, again, attains with Homer to a greater variety of use"
14437,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,and inflexion than the Danaan or Argeian names.
14438,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14439,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"He has worked it into the female forms Ἀχαιΐδες, Ἀχαιïάδες, Ἀχαιαὶ, as"
14440,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"on the other side he has done with the names Τρῶες into Τρωὲς, Τρωάδες,"
14441,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"and Τρωαὶ, and Δάρδανοι into Δαρδανίδες: but he has not made any such"
14442,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,use of the names Ἀργεῖοι and Δαναοί. The female use of the former
14443,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"appears indeed in the singular with the names of Juno and of Helen,"
14444,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"but never as applicable to Greek women in general, or to a Greek woman"
14445,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,simply as such.
14446,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14447,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"He uses it in the singular to describe ‘a Greek’ Ἀχαιὸς ἄνηρ, Il. iii."
14448,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"167, 226: which he never does for the two other names. In the same"
14449,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"manner he uses Δάρδανος ἄνηρ, Il. ii. 701. This form seems to indicate"
14450,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the full and familiar establishment of a name; and the Dardanians had,"
14451,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"we know, been Dardanians for seven generations before the _Troica_ (Il."
14452,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,xx. 215-40).
14453,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14454,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"In the opening passage of the First Iliad, not less than in that"
14455,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of the Odyssey, Homer has, as it is generally observed by critics,"
14456,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,intentionally given us a summary or ‘Argument’ of his poem. But I doubt
14457,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,whether sufficient notice has been taken of the very effective manner
14458,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in which he has given force to his purpose, by taking care in that"
14459,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,passage to use the most characteristic words. Achilles is there the son
14460,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of Peleus, for his extraction, as on both sides divine, but especially"
14461,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"as on the father’s side from Jupiter, is the groundwork of his high"
14462,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,position in the poem. Agamemnon is likewise here introduced under the
14463,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"title which establishes the same origin for him, and more than any"
14464,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,thing else enhances the dignity of his supremacy before men[694]. And
14465,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Greeks too, if I am correct, are not without significancy here"
14466,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"introduced to us, as is right, under their highest and also their best"
14467,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"established designation, that of Achæans. Nor is it until they have"
14468,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,been five times called Achæans[695] that he introduces the Danaan
14469,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"name[696] at all. The Argive name, as if the weakest, when it is first"
14470,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"employed, is placed in an awkward nearness to the title of Achæans,"
14471,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,perhaps by way of explanation:
14472,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14473,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,ὃς μέγα πάντων
14474,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ἀργείων κρατέει, καὶ οἱ πείθονται Ἀχαιοί[697]."
14475,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14476,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Again the paramount force of the Achæan name may justly be inferred
14477,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,from its being the only territorial name which had clearly grasped the
14478,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,whole of Greece at the epoch of the _Troica_[698].
14479,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14480,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Turning now entirely to what indicates more or less of peculiar
14481,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"character in the Achæans, I would observe, that the adjective δῖοι"
14482,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,appears to be the highest of all the national epithets employed by
14483,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Homer; and this he couples, as has been observed by Mure[699], (who"
14484,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"recognises a peculiar force in the term,) with the Achæan designation"
14485,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"alone among the three. He also applies it to the Pelasgi; for whom, as"
14486,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"we have found, he means it to be a highly honourable epithet. Probably"
14487,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Achæans are δῖοι because of preeminence, the Pelasgians because"
14488,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of antiquity. To no other nation or tribe whatever does he apply this
14489,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,epithet. His very chary use of it in the plural is a sign of its
14490,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,possessing in his eyes some peculiar virtue.
14491,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14492,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,_Signs of its leaning to the aristocracy._
14493,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14494,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Of its feminine forms one has been selected to convey the most biting
14495,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"form of reproach to the army, in the speech of Thersites. Now it is"
14496,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"remarkable that in that speech, of which an inflated presumption is"
14497,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the great mark, the Achæan name is used five times within nine lines,"
14498,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,and neither of the other names is used at all. I do not doubt that
14499,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the upstart and braggart uses this name only because it was the most
14500,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"distinguished or aristocratic name, as an ill-bred person always takes"
14501,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,peculiar care to call himself a gentleman. And doubtless it is for the
14502,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"same reason that he takes the feminine of Ἀχαιὸς, instead of using"
14503,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Δανααὶ or Ἀργειαὶ for his interpretative epithet, when he wants to"
14504,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,sting the soldiery as ‘Greekesses and not Greeks.’
14505,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14506,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Somewhat similar evidence is supplied by the Homeric phrase υἷες
14507,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ἀχαιῶν, which has nothing corresponding to it under the Danaan or"
14508,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Argive names. This is an Homeric formula, and the form υἷες seems to"
14509,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,belong exclusively to the Achæan name. To the Greeks who always asked
14510,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the stranger who were his parents, this phrase would carry a peculiar"
14511,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,significance. What addressed them as the sons of honoured parents
14512,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,would be to them the sharpest touchstone of honour or disgrace. And
14513,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"what the patronymic was to the individual, this form of speech was to"
14514,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the nation, an incentive under the form of an embellishment. It is a"
14515,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,principle that runs throughout Homer; it is every where μηδὲ γένος
14516,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"πατέρων αἰσχύνεμεν. The poet could not say sons of Danaans, for their"
14517,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"forefathers were not Danaan: nor sons of Argeians, for this would"
14518,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,recall the ploughshare and not the sword: though the army are addressed
14519,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"from time to time as ἥρωες Δαναοὶ, and ἥρωες Ἀχαιοὶ, they are never"
14520,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,ἥρωες Ἀργεῖοι. But to be sons of the Achæans was the great glory of the
14521,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"race, even as to degenerate from being Achæan warriors into effeminacy"
14522,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,would have been its deepest reproach: and the fact that he calls a
14523,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,mixed race sons of the Achæans is conversely a proof that the Achæan
14524,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,element was the highest and most famous element in the compound of
14525,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,their ancestry.
14526,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14527,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"But, unless I am mistaken, we have many passages in Homer where the use"
14528,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of the simple term Ἀχαιοὶ is shown from the context to have a special
14529,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"and peculiar, sometimes perhaps even an exclusive reference to the"
14530,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,chiefs and leaders of the army. I think it may be shown that the word
14531,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,has in fact three meanings:
14532,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14533,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"1. That of a particular Greek race, which extended itself from point to"
14534,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"point, acquiring power everywhere as it spread, by inherent superiority."
14535,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14536,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"2. That of the aristocracy of the country, which it naturally became by"
14537,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,virtue of such extension and assumption.
14538,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14539,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"3. That of the whole nation, which takes the name from its prime part."
14540,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14541,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,We have now to examine some passages in support of the second meaning:
14542,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"and I know not why, but certainly these passages appear in the Iliad to"
14543,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,be most abundant near the opening of the poem.
14544,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14545,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Chryses solicits ‘all the Achæans and most the two Atridæ[700].’ All
14546,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Achæans assent, except Agamemnon. Now the priest could not solicit"
14547,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the army generally except in an assembly: and there is no mention of
14548,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"one, indeed the reply of Agamemnon[701] is hardly such as would have"
14549,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"been given in one. It is likely, then, that those whom he addressed"
14550,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"were Agamemnon’s habitual and ordinary associates; in other words, the"
14551,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,chiefs.
14552,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14553,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"When Calchas proceeds to invoke the vengeance of Apollo, which is to"
14554,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"fall upon the army at large, it is no longer the Ἀχαιοὶ of whom he"
14555,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"speaks, but his prayer is,"
14556,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14557,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,τισείαν Δαναοὶ ἐμὰ δάκρυα σοῖσι βέλεσσιν[702].
14558,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14559,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Although I do not concur with those, who find no element of real"
14560,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"freedom in the condition of the Greek masses, whether at home or in the"
14561,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"camp, yet it seems plain enough, from the nature of the case, that the"
14562,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"questions relating to the division of booty, as being necessarily an"
14563,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"executive affair, must have been decided by the chiefs. Now whenever"
14564,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"questions of this class are handled, we generally find such an office"
14565,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"ascribed to Ἀχαιοί. Agamemnon says[703], ‘Do not let me alone of"
14566,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the Argeians go without a prize;’ and in conformity with this we
14567,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,find Nestor stimulating the host at large with the expectation of
14568,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"booty[704]. But Achilles replies to Agamemnon, ‘that the _Achæans_ have"
14569,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"it not in their power to compensate him there and then, for they have"
14570,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"no common stock:’ but ‘when Troy is taken, then we the Achæans will"
14571,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,repay you three and four fold[705].’ The same subject is again touched
14572,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in i. 135, 162, 392. ii. 227: and both times with reference to the"
14573,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Ἀχαιοὶ as the distributors of the spoil. In Il. ii. 255 it is allotted
14574,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,by the ἥρωες Δαναοί.
14575,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14576,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,In the same way we find a decided leaning to the use of the word
14577,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ἀχαιοὶ, when reference is made to other governing duties."
14578,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14579,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"For instance, in the adjuration of Achilles by the staff or sceptre."
14580,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"‘It has been stripped of leaf and bark, and now the υἷες Ἀχαιῶν,"
14581,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"who are intrusted by Jupiter with sovereign functions, bear it in"
14582,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,hand[706].’ It is hardly possible here to construe the phrase without
14583,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,limiting it to the chiefs.
14584,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14585,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,I have referred to the passage where Homer introduces the word Ἀργεῖοι
14586,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"for the first time, under the shadow, as it were, of Ἀχαιοί. Now, if we"
14587,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"examine that passage, we shall perceive that unless there be some shade"
14588,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"whatever of difference in the meaning, the words are tautological, an"
14589,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,imputation which Homer never merits. But if we admit in the Achæan
14590,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"name a certain bias towards the nobles of the army, then the sense and"
14591,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"expressions are alike appropriate. ‘I fear the resentment of him, who"
14592,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"mightily lords it over (all) the Greeks, and to whom even the Achæans"
14593,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,(or chiefs) submit themselves[707].’
14594,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14595,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Again the phrase Ἀχαιὸς ἄνηρ[708], twice used by Homer, and both times"
14596,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in the mouth of Priam from the Trojan wall, both times also refers"
14597,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to noble and chieftainlike figures, which his eye, keen for beauty,"
14598,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,discerns among the crowd. The second case is particularly worthy of
14599,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,notice:
14600,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14601,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"τίς τ’ ἄρ’ ὅδ’ ἄλλος Ἀχαιὸς ἀνὴρ ἤυς τε μέγας τε,"
14602,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,ἔξοχος Ἀργείων κεφάλην ἠδ’ εὔρεας ὤμους;
14603,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14604,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Of which the effect seems to be expressed in these words:
14605,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14606,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Who is th’ Achæan Chieftain
14607,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,So beautiful and tall?
14608,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"His shoulders broad surmount the crowd,"
14609,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,His head outtops them all.
14610,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14611,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Here again, if Achæan and Argeian be synonymous, the use of the latter"
14612,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"word is in the highest degree insipid, but if the reference be to"
14613,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the chief, excelling in height the mass of the soldiery, a perfect"
14614,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,propriety is maintained.
14615,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14616,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"I need not extend these illustrations to other passages, such as Il."
14617,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"ii. 80, 346. ix. 670. And, on the other hand, it is easy to point to"
14618,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,passages where the force of the Achæan and Argeian names is obviously
14619,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"identical, such as Il. ix. 521: or again where Achæan and Danaan must"
14620,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"agree, as in Il. ix. 641, 2. The most frequent use of the Achæan name"
14621,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"is, I believe, for the nation, and not the race or class: yet a number"
14622,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of passages remain to show the native bias and primitive meaning of the
14623,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,word.
14624,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14625,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"I will however point out two more places, one in each poem, where"
14626,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"that shading of the sense, for which I contend, will either greatly"
14627,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"facilitate the rendering of the text, or even may be called requisite"
14628,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,in order to attain a tolerable construction.
14629,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14630,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"1. It deserves particular notice, that Homer sometimes places the words"
14631,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in very close proximity, as in the following passage;"
14632,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14633,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,νηῶν ἐπ’ ἀρίστερα δηιόωντο
14634,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,λαοὶ ὑπ’ Ἀργείων· τάχα δ’ ἂν καὶ κῦδος Ἀχαιῶν
14635,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,ἔπλετο· τοῖος γὰρ Γαιήοχος Ἐννοσίγαιος
14636,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,ὤτρυν’ Ἀργείους·
14637,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14638,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"This is in Il. xiii. 676-8, and Δαναῶν follows in 680. The nearness of"
14639,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the words, and the place of Ἀχαιοὶ, between the twice used Ἀργεῖοι, is"
14640,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"highly insipid and un-Homeric, if they are pure equivalents. But now it"
14641,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"seems by no means impossible, that the Poet may in this passage have in"
14642,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,view a distinction between the leaders and the mass. He may have meant
14643,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to say, ‘Hector had not yet learned that his men were suffering havock"
14644,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,on the left from the Greek troops. But so it was; and the chiefs might
14645,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"now perhaps have won fame, such was the might with which Neptune urged"
14646,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"on their forces,’ but that, &c."
14647,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14648,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"2. It is difficult, except upon the supposition of a different shade of"
14649,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"meaning in these appellatives, to construe at all such a passage as"
14650,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14651,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"ἐξερέεινεν ἕκαστα,"
14652,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ἴλιον, Ἀργείων τε νέας, καὶ νόστον Ἀχαιῶν[709]."
14653,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14654,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Here the juxtaposition of the words, if they are synonymous, becomes"
14655,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"absolutely intolerable. But the sense runs easily and naturally, if we"
14656,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"render it ‘he inquired (of me) all about (the fall of) Troy, and the"
14657,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"fleet (or armament) of the Greeks, and the adventures of the chiefs"
14658,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,while on their way home.’
14659,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14660,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The Odyssey, however, appears to offer a larger contribution towards"
14661,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"our means of comprehending the Homeric use of Ἀχαιοὶ, than can be"
14662,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,supplied by the mere citation of particular passages.
14663,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14664,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,_Its application within Ithaca._
14665,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14666,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,There is considerable evidence of a division of races in Ithaca: and
14667,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,also of the application of the Achæan name to the aristocracy of the
14668,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,country.
14669,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14670,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The length of time during which Ulysses had been absent, will account"
14671,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,for much disorganization in his dominions: and their lying chiefly in
14672,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,separate insular possessions would tend to aggravate the evil. Still
14673,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"not only Nestor, Idomeneus[710], Philoctetes, Neoptolemus, but also"
14674,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Menelaus, who was absent almost as long as Ulysses himself, appear"
14675,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,to have resumed their respective thrones without difficulty; so that
14676,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,we are led to suppose there must have been much peculiarity in the
14677,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"case of Ithaca. Part of this we may find in the fact, that the family"
14678,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of Ulysses may but recently have attained to power, and that the"
14679,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"consolidation of races was imperfect. Besides his force of character,"
14680,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"he had accumulated[711] great wealth, following in the footsteps of his"
14681,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"father Laertes, who was both a conqueror and an economist[712]. His"
14682,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"power, thus depending on what was personal to himself, could not but be"
14683,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"shaken to its very base by his departure, and by his long detention in"
14684,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,foreign parts.
14685,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14686,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"So far as we can learn from the text of Homer, the family of Ulysses"
14687,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"had come, like the other Hellic families, from the north: and it had"
14688,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,only reigned in Ithaca at most for two generations. His extraction is
14689,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,not stated further back than his paternal grandfather Arceisius[713].
14690,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,But his connections all appear to be in the north. His maternal
14691,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"grandfather, Autolycus[714], lived by Parnesus, or Parnassus, in"
14692,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Phocis, near to Delphi. And his wife’s father, Icarius, had a daughter"
14693,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Iphthime, who was married to Eumelus[715], heir-apparent of Pheræ in"
14694,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the south of Thessaly: a circumstance which affords a presumption of
14695,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,proximity in their dominions. Thus it is probable that Laertes may have
14696,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"married in Thessaly; and, as we have no mention of the sovereignty of"
14697,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Arceisius, it is highly probable that Laertes was the first, either to"
14698,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"acquire the Ithacan throne, or at least to hold it for any length of"
14699,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,time.
14700,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14701,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The fountain near the city, which supplied it with water, and which"
14702,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"probably marks its foundation, was constructed, as we are told, by"
14703,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor[716]."
14704,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14705,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,The first must have been the Eponymist of the island: the second of its
14706,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,principal mountain[717].
14707,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14708,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Peisander, called ἄναξ and Πολυκτορίδης[718], is one of four principal"
14709,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Suitors, whose gifts to Penelope are specifically mentioned in the"
14710,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Eighteenth Odyssey. Thus he would appear to have been most probably
14711,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,nephew to the Eponymist of the island. Sometimes indeed the patronymic
14712,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"is derived from a grandfather, or even, as in the case of Priam"
14713,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"(Δαρδανίδης, Il. xxiv. 629, 631), from a remote ancestor; but then he"
14714,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"must apparently be a founder, or one of the highest fame. But Peisander"
14715,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,at the least may have been the son of Polyctor; and he was probably
14716,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the representative of the family, which had been displaced from the"
14717,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Sovereignty by the house of Laertes. He afterwards appears among the
14718,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,leaders in the struggle of the Suitors with Ulysses[719].
14719,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14720,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,The names applied to the subjects of Ulysses in the Odyssey are three:
14721,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Κεφαλλῆνες, Ἰθακήσιοι, and Ἀχαιοί. In accordance with its use in the"
14722,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Iliad, the first of these, which is but four times[720] used, appears"
14723,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to be a name of the whole people of the state; and, judging from what"
14724,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"we have seen of the force of the word, it implies that the Hellenic"
14725,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,element was dominant. The difference in the use of the other two is
14726,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,very marked.
14727,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14728,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"In the first place, the Suitors are commonly called Ἀχαιοὶ[721], never"
14729,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ἰθακήσιοι, nor ever Δαναοὶ or Ἀργεῖοι. Either, being the aristocracy,"
14730,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"they were an Achæan race; or else, without all being of Achæan race,"
14731,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"they were called Achæan, because they were the aristocracy. Of that"
14732,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,class they are stated to have constituted the whole[722].
14733,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14734,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The more probable of these two suppositions is, that they were by no"
14735,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"means exclusively of Achæan blood, but took the name from their birth"
14736,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,and station. It is most natural to suppose that the displaced family
14737,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of Peisander, and probably others, were not Achæan, but belonged to an"
14738,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"older stock. This stock may have been Hellenic; for, as we know, there"
14739,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"were Hellenic, and in particular Æolid, families in Greece long before"
14740,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,we hear of the Achæans there.
14741,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14742,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The house of Ulysses still indeed had friends in the island, like"
14743,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Mentor, like Noemon, son of Phronius, (or the class represented by"
14744,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"these names, if they be typical only,) or like Peiræus, who took charge"
14745,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of Theoclymenus at the request of Telemachus[723]. But the bulk of
14746,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the people were neutral, or else unfriendly. The best that Telemachus"
14747,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"can say is, that the _whole_ people is not hostile[724]. And in the"
14748,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"last Book, whilst more than one half the Assembly take up arms against"
14749,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Ulysses the rest simply[725] remain neutral: so that he has no one to
14750,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"rely upon but his father, his son, and a mere handful of dependents."
14751,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14752,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"While the Achæan name is thus exclusively applied to the Suitors, and"
14753,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"apparently to them because they formed the aristocracy, the people,"
14754,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"when assembled, are invariably addressed as Ἰθακήσιοι. It is said"
14755,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"indeed, that the Achæans[726] were summoned by the heralds to the"
14756,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Assembly of the Second Book: but it seems to have been customary
14757,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to send a special summons only to principal persons, as we find in"
14758,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Scheria[727]; though all classes were expected to attend, and did"
14759,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,attend.
14760,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14761,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"I do not, however, venture to treat it as certain, that the word Ἀχαιοὶ"
14762,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,is not applied to the population of Ithaca generally. When Euripides
14763,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"addresses the Assembly, and incites the people to revenge the death of"
14764,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Suitors, we are told that οἶκτος δ’ ἕλε πάντας Ἀχαιούς. This may"
14765,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"mean the aristocratic party in the Assembly, as we know that there were"
14766,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"two sections very differently minded. At any rate, if the whole people"
14767,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"be meant, it is by the rarest possible exception. The name is applied,"
14768,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"as we should expect, to the soldiers who sailed with Ulysses to Troy:"
14769,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,but within Ithaca it seems clear that the name properly denotes the
14770,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"nobles. And upon the whole it seems most probable, that these Ἀχαιοὶ,"
14771,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in the Twenty-third Book, are the party of the Suitors, with reference"
14772,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,rather to their position in society than their extraction: while the
14773,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"minority, who do not join in the movement against Ulysses, are probably"
14774,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the old population of the island, who have no cause of quarrel to make"
14775,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"them take up arms against him, and yet no such tie with him, either"
14776,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of race or of ancient subordination, as to induce them to move in his"
14777,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,favour.
14778,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14779,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ithaca was ill fitted for tillage, or for feeding anything but sheep"
14780,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"and goats. And Ithacus, its eponymist, being a very modern personage,"
14781,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"it seems highly probable that, whether Achæan or not, he and his race"
14782,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"were Hellenic, and gave to the population that peculiar name of"
14783,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Cephallenes, under which Laertes describes them as his subjects. But"
14784,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"there were probably anterior inhabitants of the old Pelasgian stock,"
14785,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"submerged beneath two Hellenic immigrations, caring little which of"
14786,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"their lords was uppermost, and forming the supine minority of the final"
14787,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Assembly.
14788,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14789,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The use of the Achæan name in Ithaca, in broad separation from the"
14790,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ithacesian, must then prove either its connection with a race, or its"
14791,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"bias towards a class, and may prove both. But quitting the latter as"
14792,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"sufficiently demonstrated, I now proceed to trace the local use of the"
14793,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Achæan name.
14794,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14795,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"And, first of all, we find it locally used in the North; in that"
14796,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Thessaly, where the name of Hellas came into being, and from whence it"
14797,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,extended itself to the Southward; therefore in the closest connection
14798,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,with the Hellic stem.
14799,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14800,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"We are told in the Catalogue, with respect to the division under"
14801,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Achilles, after the names of the districts and places from which they"
14802,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"came,"
14803,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14804,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Μυρμίδονες δὲ καλεῦντο, καὶ Ἕλληνες, καὶ Ἀχαιοί[728]."
14805,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14806,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Now we find throughout the Iliad, that the local or divisional name"
14807,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of this body is unchanging: the troops of Achilles are uniformly
14808,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,denominated Myrmidons. Therefore Homer does not mean that one part were
14809,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Myrmidons, another Hellenes, another Achæans, but that the three names"
14810,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"attached to the whole body, of course in different respects. They were"
14811,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"then Myrmidons, whatever the source of that name may have been, by"
14812,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"common designation. They were Hellenes, because inhabitants of Hellas,"
14813,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of the territory from whence the influence and range of that name
14814,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"had already begun to radiate, more properly and eminently therefore"
14815,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Hellenes, than others who had not so positively acquired the name,"
14816,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,though they may have been included in the Πανέλληνες. And manifestly
14817,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"they could only be called Ἀχαιοὶ, because known to be under leaders of"
14818,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the pure Achæan stock, who were entitled to carry the name in their own"
14819,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"right, instead of bearing it only in a derivative sense, and because"
14820,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,it had spread all over Greece. Of this peculiar and eminent Achæanism
14821,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in the Peleid stock, we have, I think, two other signs from the poems:"
14822,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"one in the possible meaning of the love of Juno, which we have seen"
14823,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,extended to Achilles in an equal degree with Agamemnon; the other
14824,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in the marriage of Hermione to Neoptolemus, which was founded upon"
14825,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,a promise given by Menelaus her father while before Troy. Doubtless
14826,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the eminent services of Neoptolemus might be the sole ground of this
14827,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"promise: but it may also have had to do with kin, as some special"
14828,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"relation, of neighbourhood or otherwise, appears commonly to accompany"
14829,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"these matrimonial connections. In conformity with this passage, the"
14830,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,name Ἀχαίιδες is applied by Achilles in the Ninth Book to the women of
14831,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Hellas and Phthia.

14833,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,_Local uses of the Achæan name._
14834,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14835,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,It is wonderfully illustrative of the perspicacity and accuracy of
14836,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Homer, to find that in this very spot, which he has so especially"
14837,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"marked with the Achæan name, it continued to subsist as a local"
14838,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"appellation, and to subsist here almost exclusively, all through the"
14839,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,historic ages of Greece. On this subject we shall have further occasion
14840,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,to touch.
14841,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14842,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"2. Of the five races who inhabited Crete at the time of the _Troica_,"
14843,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,one was Achæan[729]:
14844,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14845,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,ἐν μὲν Ἀχαιοὶ
14846,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"ἐν δ’ Ἐτεοκρῆτες μεγαλήτορες, ἐν δὲ Κύδωνες,"
14847,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Δωριέες τε τριχάïκες, δῖοί τε Πελασγοί."
14848,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14849,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,The presence of an Achæan tribe in Crete may have been due to its
14850,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"constant intercourse with Eastern Peloponnesus[730], where the Achæans"
14851,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"had for some time been dominant: or to those relations with Thessaly,"
14852,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,to which the name of Deucalion in Homer bears probable witness. In any
14853,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"case, the passage clearly establishes the local virtue of the name."
14854,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"It also exhibits to us Achæans as distinct from Dorians, and shows us"
14855,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"that there were a variety of branches, known to Homer, of the Hellenic"
14856,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,tree. And the enumeration of the Achæan and Pelasgian races with others
14857,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in this place, compared with the uniform description in the Iliad of"
14858,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the whole force of Idomeneus as Cretan, shows us how careful Homer was"
14859,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,to avoid such confusion as the juxtaposition of Achæans and Pelasgians
14860,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,would have caused with reference to the main ethnical division in the
14861,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Iliad.
14862,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14863,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"3. In the Pylian raid of the Eleventh Book, Nestor carefully"
14864,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"distinguishes between the parties, as Epeans, also called Elians, on"
14865,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the one side, and Pylians, also called Achæans, on the other[731]. This"
14866,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"raid took place in his early youth, perhaps forty or fifty years before"
14867,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the _Troica_, and within the Achæan epoch. And as he withholds the"
14868,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Achæan name from the other party, they plainly were not Achæan in the"
14869,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"limited sense. And yet they were Hellenic: for, among other Hellenic"
14870,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"signs, Augeas, the king of the Epeans, was an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Thus again"
14871,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"we have Achæan fixed as a subdivision, though probably the principal"
14872,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"subdivision, of the Hellenic race."
14873,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14874,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"4. A fourth case, in which the Achæan name appears clearly to have a"
14875,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"limited signification, is in a second passage of the Greek Catalogue,"
14876,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"where a part of the forces of Diomed are described as those,"
14877,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14878,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"οἵ τ’ ἔχον Αἰγίνην, Μάσητά τε, κοῦροι Ἀχαιῶν[732]."
14879,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14880,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Although Mases has been taken to be a town, yet its junction here"
14881,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,with Ægina perhaps rather points to it as an island. It appears to be
14882,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,admitted that its site is unknown. And an extra-Homeric tradition[733]
14883,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"reports, that the small islands off the Trœzenian coast were called"
14884,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,after Pelops. It is impossible not to observe the correspondence
14885,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"between this tradition, and the indirect traditions afforded us by"
14886,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Homer’s language in this verse. For in the Catalogue he seems carefully
14887,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,to avoid repeating the general Greek appellatives in connection with
14888,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the inhabitants of particular places, and to give them local and"
14889,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"special names only. It follows irresistibly, that therefore he must"
14890,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,be understood here to speak of the distinct race and local name of
14891,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Achæans: to which race and name would naturally belong any settlers
14892,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,brought by Pelops into Southern Greece.
14893,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14894,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"And, as Homer does not discontinue altogether the application of the"
14895,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Argeian name to the inhabitants of Argolis, he probably in this place"
14896,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"means to distinguish Achæans not only from other Greek races, but even"
14897,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"from other subjects of Tydeus and of Diomed, who would most properly be"
14898,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,called Argeians.
14899,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14900,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"It thus appears, that twice in the Catalogue Homer has occasion to use"
14901,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Achæan name locally, and in its original or, so to speak, gentile"
14902,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,sense. And accordingly he has been careful not to risk confusion by
14903,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,employing it in its wider signification either at the commencement of
14904,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the Catalogue or at the close. In both cases he uses the word Δαναοί;
14905,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the only one of his great appellatives which nowhere takes a local or
14906,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,otherwise varied meaning. When he begins he invites the Muse to tell
14907,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"him, v. 487,"
14908,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14909,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,οἵτινες ἡγεμόνες Δαναῶν καὶ κοίρανοι ἦσαν.
14910,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14911,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"So also at the close, v. 760, he sums up in these words,"
14912,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14913,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,οὗτοι ἀρ’ ἡγεμόνες Δαναῶν καὶ κοίρανοι ἦσαν.
14914,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14915,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"5. As Nestor applies the Achæan name to the inhabitants of Pylos, so"
14916,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,from the time of the Pelopid sway it becomes applicable to those of
14917,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Eastern Peloponnesus generally, in a sense wider than that of Il. ii."
14918,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"562, but yet narrower than the national one. In Il. iv. 384, and Il."
14919,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"v. 803, those, from among whom Tydeus set out for Thebes, are called"
14920,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ἀχαιοί. So also in the colloquy with Glaucus, Diomed calls the comrades"
14921,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of his father on that occasion by the same name (Il. vi. 223). He
14922,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"repeats the name in his prayer to Minerva, Il. x. 286, 7; and here he"
14923,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"is careful to distinguish them from the Thebans of that epoch, who are"
14924,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Καδμεῖοι (288).
14925,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14926,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,_The name Παναχαιοι._
14927,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14928,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"6. In further prosecution of the same subject, we have yet to consider"
14929,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the force of the kindred Homeric word Παναχαιοί.
14930,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14931,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,This is undoubtedly a term that challenges particular notice. No writer
14932,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,is so little wont as Homer to vary his expressions without a reason for
14933,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,it. But since the word Ἀχαιοὶ is used many hundred times as the simple
14934,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"equipollent of Greek, it cannot require the prefix παν to enable it"
14935,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,to convey this sense effectually. Therefore to suppose that Παναχαιοὶ
14936,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"means Greeks and nothing more, would render the prefix unmeaning, and"
14937,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,I conclude that such cannot be an adequate explanation of its purpose.
14938,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,But if we construe the word as having a specific reference not only to
14939,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the aggregate, but to the parts of which it is made up, then the prefix"
14940,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,παν becomes abundantly charged with meaning. The word Παναχαιοὶ will in
14941,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"this view mean what we should call ‘all classes of the Greeks,’ ‘the"
14942,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Greeks from the highest to the lowest.’
14943,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14944,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"It is used, in all, eleven times. Of these eleven passages, seven times"
14945,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,it appears in the expression ἀριστῆες Παναχαιῶν. Here the preceding
14946,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,word ἀριστῆες at once directs the mind to this notice of the different
14947,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"classes, and receives much force from the distinctive particle παν: as"
14948,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"we may judge from the fact that Homer never but once (ἀριστῆες Δαναῶν,"
14949,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Il. xvii. 225) appends the appellative in its simple form to ἀριστῆες.
14950,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The prefix παν seems to strip the idea of conventionality, and to make"
14951,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,it real: the chiefs are the pick and flower of the whole Greek array.
14952,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14953,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Only in one other passage of the Iliad do we find Παναχαιοί; it is in
14954,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the peroration of the speech of Ulysses to Achilles[734]:
14955,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14956,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"εἰ δέ τοι Ἀτρείδης μὲν ἀπήχθετο κηρόθι μᾶλλον,"
14957,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"αὐτὸς καὶ τοῦ δῶρα, σὺ δ’ ἄλλους περ Παναχαιοὺς"
14958,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,τειρομένους ἐλέαιρε κατὰ στρατόν.
14959,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14960,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"‘Still, if you detest (the king) Atrides from your heart ever so"
14961,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"much, him and his gifts, yet pity the Greeks throughout the army, now"
14962,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,suffering from the highest to the lowest.’ The force of the Παναχαιοὶ
14963,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,κατὰ στρατὸν is here very marked.
14964,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14965,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Lastly, in the Odyssey we find the line thrice repeated,"
14966,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14967,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"τῷ κέν οἱ τυμβὸν μὲν ἐποίησαν Παναχαιοί,"
14968,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14969,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,and always in the same connection with the death of some select and
14970,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"beloved hero of the army. Its obvious sense is, ‘all classes of the"
14971,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Greeks would have joined to do him honour, by lending a hand to raise"
14972,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,his funeral mound.’
14973,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14974,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,In every one of these cases therefore the word Παναχαιοὶ seems to
14975,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"express the combination of all classes, and thus to point distinctly"
14976,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,to the word Ἀχαιοὶ as capable of signifying something less than all
14977,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"classes, namely, one, that is, the ruling class."
14978,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14979,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,The construction thus put upon Παναχαιοὶ is in conformity with Homer’s
14980,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,usual mode of employing such words as the adjective πᾶς and the
14981,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,preposition σὺν in composition. We have previously seen the intensive
14982,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,force of πᾶς in πᾶν Ἄργος and Πανέλληνες. And πᾶς itself receives
14983,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"additional power from σύν. As in Il. i., where Achilles, having just"
14984,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"before reminded Calchas of his office as Seer to the Δαναοὶ, proceeds"
14985,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,to assure him that no one of the Greeks shall hurt him for doing his
14986,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"duty, it is now no one, not of the Δαναοὶ merely, but of the σύμπαντες"
14987,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Δαναοί; no, not even if he name Agamemnon himself as the guilty"
14988,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,person[735].
14989,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14990,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,It is hardly necessary to point out how accurately all this coincides
14991,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,with the general results to which we have been already led. According
14992,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to these, the bulk of the Greeks were a Pelasgian population, under the"
14993,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"sway of ruling tribes and families, belonging to another race; among"
14994,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,which the most powerful were those belonging to the Achæan stock; and
14995,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"whose Argeian name was etymologically, and perhaps practically, a sort"
14996,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of substitute for the older Pelasgian one.
14997,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
14998,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Nor is there difficulty in conceiving how, if the Achæans became the"
14999,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"dominant race in the most important parts of Greece, they might,"
15000,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"without constituting a numerical majority, give their name to the mass"
15001,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of the people, and to the country itself, as Britain and Britons became"
15002,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"England and English from the Angles, or as Lombardy took its name from"
15003,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Lombards, and, unhappily, European Turkey, once the civil head of"
15004,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Christendom, from the Turks."
15005,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15006,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,_The Æolid and Æolian names._
15007,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15008,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,It has been customary to speak of the question whether Homer was
15009,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,an Æolian Greek: to give the Æolian name to the forms of the Greek
15010,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,language prevailing in his time: and to describe the Achæans as a
15011,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"branch of the Æolians. With certain exceptions, says Strabo[736], the"
15012,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Æolian name still prevails outside the Isthmus; and it also covered
15013,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Peloponnesus, till a mixture took place. The Ionians from Attica"
15014,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"had occupied Ægialus; and when the Heraclids, with the Dorians, became"
15015,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"masters of many Peloponnesian cities, the Ionians were expelled in"
15016,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"their turn ὑπὸ Ἀχαιῶν, Αἰολικοῦ ἔθνους, after which two ἔθνη only"
15017,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"remained in Peloponnesus, the Æolian and the Dorian."
15018,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15019,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Again, as respects the _digamma_, Heyne[737] most justly observes"
15020,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,that it may much more justly be called Pelasgic than Æolic; since the
15021,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Æolians, as far as we know, only retained it, after having found it"
15022,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in use with the Pelasgi. But in general, to those who ground their"
15023,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"judgments on the Homeric text, the whole view of the relation of"
15024,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Achæans and Æolians, as it is commonly given, will appear a false"
15025,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,one. In the first place the Æolians as a nation or tribe are wholly
15026,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,post-Homeric: unless we are bold enough to find some modification of
15027,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"their name in the Αἴτωλοι. The Æolid families, indeed, of Homer have"
15028,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"evidently a great position, which we shall further discuss[738]: but"
15029,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"they simply fall for the time under the general name of Achæans, as"
15030,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"much as any other families, and more than families like the Æacidæ,"
15031,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,who were in close political relations with a race bearing a designation
15032,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of its own, namely, the Myrmidons. This nowhere appears to have been"
15033,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the case with the Æolians. On the contrary, the Neleids, though they"
15034,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"were of illegitimate birth, may perhaps be considered as belonging"
15035,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to the Æolidæ; but their subjects actually bore the name of Achæans,"
15036,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,besides their territorial name of Pylians[739]. With respect to the
15037,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"epoch of the _Troica_, instead of calling the Achæans an Æolic race, it"
15038,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,would be more reasonable to call the Æolids (as there was nothing more
15039,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,extensive than a patronymic connected with that name) Achæan houses. I
15040,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,do not however mean that they were properly such: for the Æolid name
15041,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"appears in Southern Greece before the Achæan, and was probably an older"
15042,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,branch from the same trunk.
15043,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15044,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,The subsequent prevalence of the Æolian as compared with the Achæan
15045,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"name, (the Hellenic, however, overlying and soon absorbing both,)"
15046,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,appears to point to one of two suppositions. Either there was an
15047,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"original Æolian tribe, which has escaped notice altogether in Homer,"
15048,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"as the Dorians have all but escaped it: or else, and more probably,"
15049,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,it may have happened that part at least of these Æolian houses held
15050,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"their ground in Greece, while the Achæan name, which had been elevated"
15051,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"by the political predominance of the Pelopid sovereigns, collapsed"
15052,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,upon the loss of that predominance. It was to be expected that the
15053,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"name should share in the downfall of the race, when the Heraclid and"
15054,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Dorian invasion expelled the bearers of it from the seat of their
15055,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"power, and reduced them first to be fugitives, and then to settle in"
15056,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"a mere strip of the Peloponnesus; a single region of narrow scope,"
15057,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"and, as is remarked by Polybius[740] after many centuries, of small"
15058,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"weight and influence, which from them was called Achæa. The fact that"
15059,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Dorian name is all but unknown to Homer, while the Achæan one is"
15060,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"at its zenith, not only heroically, as in the Iliad, but in the every"
15061,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"day familiar use of Ithaca throughout the Odyssey, is to me one of"
15062,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"several strong presumptions, not countervailed by any evidence of equal"
15063,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"strength, that Homer could not have lived to see that great revolution,"
15064,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"which so completely effaced the ethnical landmarks, and altered the"
15065,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"condition, of Southern Greece."

15067,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,_The Heraclids in Homer._
15068,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15069,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,There is certainly a striking analogy between the relation of the Æolid
15070,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,houses named in Homer to the afterwards prevalent and powerful Æolian
15071,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"race, and that of the Heraclid families, also named by him, to the"
15072,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Dorian race, which in like manner grew from obscurity in the Homeric"
15073,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,period to such great after-celebrity. Hercules himself appears before
15074,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"us in the ancient legend as the great Dorian hero, ‘everywhere paving"
15075,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the road for his people and their worship, and protecting them from"
15076,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,other races[741].’ The only Heraclids mentioned nominally by Homer are
15077,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Tlepolemus, Pheidippus, Antiphus; and there are others without names"
15078,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"specified[742]; none of these, or of the Greeks of the expedition, are"
15079,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"called Dorians, while, again, none of the Heraclids of Homer are called"
15080,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"by the Achæan or Æolid names. They may have been Dorian houses, like"
15081,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Æolid houses; and the name may have become tribal afterwards, when"
15082,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,they rose to power. The tradition of the reception of certain Heraclids
15083,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,in Attica appears to have been recognised by the Lacedæmonians in
15084,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the historic ages[743], and in the supposition of a friendship thus"
15085,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"established, we may perhaps find the true explanation of the Decelean"
15086,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,privilege mentioned by Herodotus[744].
15087,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15088,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"In arranging chronologically the Danaan, Argeian, and Achæan names of"
15089,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Homer, we give the first place to Danaan, and the next to Argeian, so"
15090,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,as to bring the Danaans nearest to the Pelasgi. But the real meaning of
15091,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,this is simply that the three names were suggested to Homer by three
15092,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"periods of Greek history, which stand in the order given to the names."
15093,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"If, however, instead of tracing the purpose of the Poet, we are to look"
15094,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"for ethnical history, then we must state that the Danaan name does not"
15095,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"denote a change of race, but it is a mere foreign affix to the closing"
15096,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"portion of the Pelasgian period. Nor does the Argeian name, if we"
15097,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,suppose it to have been a sort of translation or reconstruction of the
15098,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Pelasgian, directly indicate the Hellenic infusion; but the mere fact"
15099,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of its substitution for a preceding appellation appears to presuppose a
15100,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"cause. Homer, indeed, gives us no Greek stories of the Danaid period,"
15101,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,so that we do not certainly know that he might not have described the
15102,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Greeks of that period also as Argeian. All we can say positively is,"
15103,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,that his use of the Argeian name _de facto_ begins with the epoch of
15104,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the first Hellenic throne in Greece, that of the Perseids. I hope to"
15105,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,show that the Achæan name and that of Perseus belong in truth to the
15106,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,same stock and origin[745]: but it is with the Pelopids only that the
15107,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Achæan name appears, and it denotes the second stage of the Hellenic"
15108,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"preponderance, as the Argeian name marks the first, and the Dorian the"
15109,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"third. The first, or Argeian, stage belongs partly, as I believe, to"
15110,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the house of Perseus, but partly, as is clear from the Homeric text,"
15111,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,to the houses descended from Æolus.
15112,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15113,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,_Descent of the Æolids._
15114,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15115,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Æolus himself is nowhere mentioned in Homer. The oldest Αἰολίδαι given
15116,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,to us as such are Sisyphus and Cretheus. The patronymic does not of
15117,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"itself enable us to determine whether these were sons of Æolus, or were"
15118,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,more remotely descended from him. But indirectly we may perhaps be
15119,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"enabled to fix his date, as follows:"
15120,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15121,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"1. Bellerophon the grandson of Sisyphus[746], is called by the"
15122,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"contemporary Lycian king, the offspring of the deity, that is, of"
15123,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Jupiter:
15124,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15125,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,γίγνωσκε θεοῦ γόνον ἠῢν ἐόντα[747].
15126,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15127,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The meaning of this can only be that the person, whom Homer has"
15128,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"indicated as the founder of the race, namely Æolus, was a reputed son"
15129,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of Jupiter.
15130,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15131,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"2. In the Νεκυΐα of the Eleventh Odyssey we are introduced to Tyro, the"
15132,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"daughter of Salmoneus, and the wife of Cretheus[748]. She is decorated"
15133,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"with the epithet εὐπατέρεια, never given elsewhere by Homer except to"
15134,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Helen, and apparently an equivalent with him for Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα."
15135,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15136,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"It is by no means unlikely, I would venture to suggest, that a similar"
15137,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"force may lie in the epithet Salmoneus, who is here called ἀμύμων."
15138,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,That epithet is indeed sometimes applied on the ground of personal
15139,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"character. But Homer also gives it to the villain Ægisthus, which"
15140,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,appears quite inexplicable except on the ground of the divine descent
15141,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of the Pelopids[749]. The later tradition has loaded Salmoneus with
15142,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the crime of audacious profanity: and it has also, beginning with"
15143,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Hesiod[750], made him a son of Æolus. The word ἀμύμων, combined with"
15144,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the εὐπατέρεια of Tyro, leaves little room for doubt that perhaps both,"
15145,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,and certainly the latter of these representations are agreeable to the
15146,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"sense of Homer. If so, then Tyro was a granddaughter of Æolus; and we"
15147,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"can at once fix his date from Homer, as follows:"
15148,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15149,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,1. Æolus.
15150,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"2. Salmoneus, Od. xi. 235-7."
15151,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"3. Tyro = Cretheus, ibid."
15152,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"4. Pheres, Od. xi. 259."
15153,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"5. Admetus, Il. ii. 711-15, 763."
15154,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"6. Eumelus, ibid. and Od. iv. 798."
15155,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15156,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,From which last cited passage I set down Eumelus as the contemporary
15157,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of his brother-in-law Ulysses, and half a generation senior to the"
15158,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,standard age of the war.
15159,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15160,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,We have also the collateral line of Sisyphus from Æolus as follows: 1.
15161,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Sisyphus; 2. Glaucus (1); 3. Bellerophon; 4. Hippolochus; 5. Glaucus
15162,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"(2), contemporary with the war[751]. According to this table Sisyphus"
15163,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,might be either the son or the grandson of Æolus.
15164,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15165,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"And again, Cretheus, who like Sisyphus is Αἰολίδης, may have been"
15166,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,either the uncle or the cousin of his wife Tyro. The Fragment of Hesiod
15167,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"would make both him and Sisyphus sons of Æolus, and therefore uncles to"
15168,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Tyro.
15169,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15170,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,These genealogies are in perfect keeping with what Homer tells us of
15171,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Neleid line. Tyro, he says, fell in love with Enipeus. In the"
15172,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"likeness of that river, Neptune had access to her, and she bore to"
15173,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"him two sons, Pelias and Neleus. Neleus is the father of Nestor: and"
15174,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Nestor stands one generation senior to Eumelus; for he was in his third
15175,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"tri-decadal period[752], if the expression may be allowed, during the"
15176,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"action of the Iliad. Thus we have (as before), 3. Tyro; 4. Neleus; 5."
15177,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Nestor; 6. Nestor. The maternal genealogy of Eumelus brings us exactly
15178,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to the same point: for Alcestis, the daughter of Pelias, was married to"
15179,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,his father Admetus[753].
15180,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15181,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Thus the Æolid genealogies are laid down by Homer with great clearness,"
15182,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"except as to the first interval, and with a singular self-consistency."
15183,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Perseus[754], as we have seen, belongs to the fifth generation before"
15184,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the war. This is nearly the same with Sisyphus, and with Cretheus: and"
15185,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,we are thus enabled to determine with tolerable certainty the epoch of
15186,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the first Hellenic infusion into Greece. It precedes the arrival of
15187,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Portheus in Ætolia by one generation, and that of Pelops by two."
15188,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15189,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Of Sisyphus we know from Homer, that he lived at an Ephyre on or near"
15190,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the Isthmus of Corinth. It is not so clear whether Cretheus ever came
15191,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,into the Peloponnesus. There is an Enipeus of Elis: but there is also
15192,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"one[755] of Thessaly, which was doubtless its original. The name,"
15193,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"however, of the Thessalian stream appears to have been written Eniseus."
15194,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Nitzsch[756] determines, on insufficient grounds as far as I can judge,"
15195,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,that the passage of Od. xi. cannot mean the Enipeus of Pisatis. I can
15196,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,find no conclusive evidence either way: but Sisyphus was certainly in
15197,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Southern Greece at or before this time, so that we need not wonder"
15198,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"if Cretheus, another Æolid, was there also. His reputed son Neleus"
15199,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"founded, without doubt, the kingdom of Pylos. Post-Homeric tradition"
15200,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"places even Salmoneus, the father of Tyro, in Elis."

15203,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15204,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,We have now before us an outline of the first entrance of Hellic
15205,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"elements into Greece, south of Thessaly. It seems to have been effected"

15215,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,

15217,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"and only then follows the great house of the Pelopids, not alone, but"
15218,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in conjunction with a race, to whose history we now must turn."
15219,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15220,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Of the Danaid and Perseid princes we have no reason to suppose, that"
15221,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,they enjoyed the extended power which was wielded by Agamemnon. Not
15222,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"only would they appear to have been circumscribed, latterly at least,"
15223,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"by the Minoan empire founded in Crete, but Homer gives us no intimation"
15224,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,that their dominion at any time included the possession of a supremacy
15225,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,over a number of subordinate princes beyond their own immediate
15226,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"borders, or reached beyond the territory which may be generally"
15227,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,described as the Eastern Peloponnesus.
15228,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15229,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,A direct inference bearing on this subject may be obtained from the
15230,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,passage concerning the sceptre of Agamemnon[757]: for the Pelopids do
15231,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"not succeed to that of Eurystheus and the Perseids, but they hold from"
15232,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Jupiter: which seems to imply that they acquired much more, than had"
15233,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,been under the sway of their predecessors. Probably therefore we shall
15234,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"do well to conclude that Eurystheus, for example, had a limited realm,"
15235,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"and that by land only: Agamemnon, a certain supremacy by land and sea,"
15236,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,within the range of which the old Minoan empire had now fallen. Still
15237,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the kingdom of Eurystheus was probably in its own day the greatest, and"
15238,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"was also probably the oldest, of all properly Hellenic kingdoms."
15239,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15240,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"If, then, neither of the prior dynasties of Danaus and Perseus reigned"
15241,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"over all Greece, it is unlikely that either of them could give a name"
15242,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,to the whole nation: though they might give a name to the part of
15243,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the country which, having in their time been particularly famous and"
15244,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"powerful, became under the Pelopids a metropolis, supreme throughout"
15245,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the rest of the country; and whose people then not only took the name
15246,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of Ἀχαιοὶ for itself, but extended it over the whole of Greece."
15247,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15248,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,_Use of the Danaan and Argeian names poetical._
15249,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15250,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"It is thus more than probable that the scope of the name Danai, (if"
15251,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"we are to assume that it was then a name in actual use,) under the"
15252,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Danaids, and of the name Ἀργεῖοι under the Perseids, was local, and"
15253,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"confined in the main to Eastern Peloponnesus, where those princes"
15254,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"ruled; with the addition of any other parts of the country, over which"
15255,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"they might for the time have extended their power. And if so, then"
15256,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"we have to suppose that Homer, having received the traditions of the"
15257,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Danaan and Argeian princes as having been at the head in their own time
15258,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of Greek history or legend, gave to the nation by way of a poetical"
15259,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"name, but of a poetical name only, the appellation which their subjects"
15260,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"respectively had borne, and which had never before been, and never"
15261,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"became by any other title than his poetical authority, applicable to"
15262,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,all the Greeks.
15263,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15264,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"The Achæan name, on the other hand, differs from these, first, in"
15265,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"denoting the extension of a particular race, though not over the whole"
15266,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"country, yet through very many of its parts, and secondly, in the"
15267,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,fact that the ruling house of those who bore the name enjoyed a real
15268,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,political supremacy over both the continent and the islands. So that it
15269,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"became the most legitimate exponent of Greek nationality, until it had"
15270,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,lost both its extension and its power; the one by compression of its
15271,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,principal tribes into a narrow space: the other by the transfer of its
15272,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"political prerogatives to the great Dorian family of the Spartan kings,"
15273,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,after the conquest of the Heraclidæ.
15274,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15275,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"When the Achæans had ceased to predominate, there could be no reason"
15276,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"why their name should remain stamped upon their brethren, who boasted"
15277,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of the same descent, and who had attained to greater force."
15278,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15279,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"As in the Homeric times, while the Achæans were the leaders of Greece,"
15280,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"they might claim to represent the whole Hellenic stock, so, when the"
15281,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Dorians had dethroned them and occupied the seat of power, when the"
15282,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Æolian name was widely diffused, and, again, when Athens with its mixed"
15283,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"race became great, and claimed, along with its vaunts of antiquity and"
15284,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"continuity, to pass over, as Herodotus says, to the Hellenic class,"
15285,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"but without an Achæan descent, then the Achæan name could no longer"
15286,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"adequately represent the title to nationality, and the various races"
15287,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,naturally fell back on the designation which gave no exclusive right
15288,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"or preeminence to any of them, and which they were all entitled to"
15289,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,enjoy in common. They apparently however chose to be connected with the
15290,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"rich plains of Thessaly, where they first learned civilization, and"
15291,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"organized their collective or national life, rather than with the rude"
15292,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,and coarse manners of their more remote ancestors in the hills. They
15293,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"were therefore not Helli, but Hellenes."
15294,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15295,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,This may be considered as the _rationale_ of the common and palpably
15296,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"manufactured tradition respecting Hellen and his family, of which we"
15297,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,have the earliest form in Hesiod.
15298,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15299,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,_Summary of the Evidence._
15300,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15301,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Our conclusions respecting the names by which Homer describes the
15302,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,inhabitants of Greece may now be summed up as follows:
15303,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15304,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"1. We set out from the point at which Greece is, probably for the first"
15305,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"time, settled by a race given to tillage and pacific habits, under"
15306,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the general name of Pelasgians, with subdivision under minor names of"
15307,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"particular tribes, or partially and locally intermixed with fragments"
15308,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of other races.
15309,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15310,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"2. A dynasty of foreign origin, in a portion of Greece which then"
15311,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"became, and ever after continued to be most famous, leads the march of"
15312,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"events; and, apparently without displacing the Pelasgians themselves,"
15313,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"yet seems to have displaced, in a certain quarter, the Pelasgic by"
15314,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Danaan name; at any rate, it attains to such celebrity, that its"
15315,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"history, in the eye of Homer, fills the whole breadth of its own epoch,"
15316,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"and its name stands in after time, poetically at least, for a national"
15317,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,title.
15318,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15319,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"3. An Hellenic dynasty of Perseids, belonging to the Greek Peninsula,"
15320,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"follows this dynasty; and, effacing the trace of foreign rule, governs"
15321,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"its subjects under the Argeian or Argive name; which, without reviving"
15322,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the title of the Pelasgi, a word now becoming or become subordinate,"
15323,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,yet like that title is founded on the physical character of the regions
15324,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in which the population was settled, and upon the employments suited"
15325,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,thereto.
15326,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15327,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"4. Next appears upon the scene the Achæan name, which bears no mark of"
15328,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"relationship to the soil, or to any particular employment, or to any"
15329,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"particular eponymist, but appears to be the designation of a race, not"
15330,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"indeed foreign, yet new to the Peloponnesus."
15331,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15332,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,5. A warlike and highly gifted race gradually pervade different parts
15333,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of Greece under this name: the Pelopids, its ruling family, possessing"
15334,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"themselves of the throne of the Perseids, attain, perhaps through the"
15335,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"extended sympathy of Achæan blood, to a national supremacy. The Achæans"
15336,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"are, in fact, become the Greeks of the Troic age. They include Æolids"
15337,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"and Æacids, Argives, Bœotians, Ætolians, Epeans, Abantes, Dorians,"
15338,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Arcadians, Ionians, and all the other local tribes, as well as the mass"
15339,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of old Pelasgians, who constitute the working population (so to speak)"
15340,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of the country; some of them by virtue of blood, and the rest by that"
15341,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"political union, in which the Achæans had an undisputed ascendancy."
15342,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15343,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"6. All the characteristics of this race, social and religious, and its"
15344,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"close geographical proximity to, if not indeed its identity with, the"
15345,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"first-named or Myrmidon Hellenes of Homer, appear to derive it from the"
15346,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"North, to dissociate it from the Pelasgic, and to unite it with the"
15347,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Hellic stock.
15348,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15349,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,7. Time passes on; we lose the guiding hand of Homer; but universal
15350,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"tradition assures us that the Dorians, emerging, like those who had"
15351,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"preceded them, from the cradle of the nation, lead another and the last"
15352,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,great Hellenic migration southward; the Pelopids are driven from the
15353,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,throne of that which may be termed the metropolitan region of Greece;
15354,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"they migrate to an inferior seat, with their followers, and become the"
15355,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"obscure heads of a secondary State: and the name of Hellenes, belonging"
15356,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to all the great Greek tribes in common, whether of Achæan, Æolid, or"
15357,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Dorian blood or connection, becomes the grand historical designation of"
15358,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the nation at large.
15359,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15360,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"8. After perhaps eight hundred years of fame and freedom for Hellas,"
15361,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the iron hand of Roman power descends upon her at a time when the old
15362,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Achæan name has revived by means of a democratic confederacy, and has"
15363,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"once more overspread[758] the Peloponnesus. From this time, Hellas"
15364,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"takes her place in history only as a minor portion of the Roman empire,"
15365,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"even while, by an inward process, she is asserting her intellectual"
15366,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"supremacy[759], and moulding the literature and philosophy of her"
15367,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,conquerors. But to them politically she is no more than an appendage of
15368,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the _Magna Græcia_, whose glory it is to be a part of imperial Italy,"
15369,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,and whose name the land of Homer’s song must now assume in virtue of a
15370,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"double relationship; the first, that of their common social base, the"
15371,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"old Pelasgi, of whom the Greeks (Γραïκοὶ) were probably a part; and the"
15372,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"second, that of a more recent colonization. Thus the Graic or Greek"
15373,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"name, having existed, but never having emerged to what may be called"
15374,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"visibility in Hellas, travels round to it again by the route of Italy,"
15375,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,and finally becomes predominant in this its earliest seat.
15376,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15377,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Of this intermixture and succession of names dependent on the fusion of
15378,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"races, and on political supremacy, we have sufficient example in our"
15379,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"own island. It has been inhabited by Britons, Romans, Angles, Saxons,"
15380,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Jutes, Danes, and Normans. All came more or less as conquerors, one"
15381,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"following upon the other. But two names only have left their mark,"
15382,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Britons and Angles: all the others, including the last or Norman"
15383,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"conquerors, are submerged. So it has been with the succession of"
15384,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Pelasgians, Achæans, Hellenes, Greeks. Each of these names historically"
15385,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"superseded the one before it. Apart from them, by the high privilege"
15386,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of Poetry, stand their names in another combination: the Iliad"
15387,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"and Odyssey shew us Danaans, Argeians, and Achæans, as in the main"
15388,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"synonymous before Troy: yet each with its own leaning, which makes"
15389,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Δαναοὶ most properly and by preference ‘the soldiery,’ Ἀργεῖοι, ‘the"
15390,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"masses,’ and Ἀχαιοὶ, ‘the chiefs.’"
15391,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15392,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,It still remains to observe the immediately subsequent literary history
15393,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of these three great appellatives, which the _fiat_ of Homer made so"
15394,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,famous.
15395,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15396,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Hesiod and the minor Greek poets afford us the only satisfactory
15397,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"illustration of actual usage, because the tragedians may probably have"
15398,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"sought, in treating heroic subjects, to employ the nomenclature of the"
15399,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"heroic age. The other poets spoke, of course, according to their own"
15400,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,respective ages.
15401,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15402,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,In Hesiod we do not find Δαναοὶ at all: Ἀργεῖος only in the singular
15403,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"for Juno: Ἀχαιοὶ is once used for the Greeks collectively, in a"
15404,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,retrospective passage referring to the assembly at Aulis[760]. He uses
15405,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,Πανέλληνες[761] in the same poem with the same sense. An important
15406,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"passage of Strabo[762] testifies, that both Hesiod and Archilochus were"
15407,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,acquainted with the use of the names Ἕλληνες and Πανέλληνες for the
15408,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Greeks at large; and refers to works of theirs, now lost, by way of"
15409,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,example as to the latter term. Both Ἕλλας and Ἕλληνες are freely used
15410,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in Simonides, who also has Ἀργεῖοι for the Argives only. And generally"
15411,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"these old writers, coming next after Hesiod, knew nothing of the use of"
15412,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Ἀργεῖοι, or even of Ἀχαιοὶ, for the whole nation, while the word Δαναοὶ"
15413,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,is not found in them at all.
15414,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15415,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"This is strongly confirmatory, as it appears to me, of the propositions"
15416,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,I have endeavoured to establish.
15417,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15418,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Among the tragedians the name Ἀχαιὸς, with its derivatives, used to"
15419,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"some extent by Æschylus, progressively declines: the Danaan name holds"
15420,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"its ground rather better, and Ἀργεῖος better still; though all are"
15421,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"eclipsed by the great historical name of Hellenes, which probably had"
15422,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,enjoyed an undisputed prevalence from the time of the Dorian conquest.
15423,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"Thus, for poetical use, dealing with the events and characters of the"
15424,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"heroic age, they properly fall back upon the names which Homer employed."
15425,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15426,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,_Its value as primitive history._
15427,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15428,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"From these successions of name, whether the particular appellation be"
15429,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"founded upon lineage or upon physical incidents, it is not unreasonable"
15430,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"to hold that we may draw the outlines of a primitive history, at least"
15431,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,with more confidence and satisfaction than by efforts to compound and
15432,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,piece together the miscellaneous and promiscuous traditions of many
15433,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"ages and places, set wide apart from one another; in respect to which,"
15434,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"even where we have not to lament the gnawing power of Time, we, at"
15435,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"least, know that the faculties both of exaggeration and of invention,"
15436,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"stimulated by vanity, rivalry, and self-interest in many other forms,"
15437,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"have been at work. It is better to deal with slighter relics, of which"
15438,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"we know the _bona fides_, than with an abundance of such as have been"
15439,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"falsified. Besides, when we have effectually exhausted the power of"
15440,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the first, we may much more profitably use the subsidiary lights which"
15441,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the second will afford us. And the tendency of an attempt to invest
15442,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the Homeric text with an unequivocal supremacy, is to substitute for"
15443,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"complete and symmetrical systems, in which the hewn stone and the trash"
15444,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"are not distinguishable one from another, very slight and partial"
15445,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"indeed, but yet authoritative fragments and outlines, all the intervals"
15446,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,of which are filled up by avowed conjecture. This conjecture is
15447,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"without a pretence to authority properly so called, but it is, at any"
15448,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"rate, both kept visibly apart from what is authoritative, and likewise"
15449,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"founded upon the suggestions which even fragmentary testimony, when"
15450,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"genuine and near the source, is well qualified to make."
15451,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,
15452,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,And the succession of names is in effect of itself almost a political

15454,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,such things have been done to particular cities within the dominion of
15455,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"particular states. The names of races, especially of races disposed,"
15456,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"like the Greeks, to knit themselves closely with the past, are"
15457,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"cherished as a material portion of their patrimony. When they alter,"
15458,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"it is for some great and commanding political reason. Such as, for"
15459,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"example, if some tribe or family, previously not advanced beyond its"
15460,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"fellows, in some great national exigency becomes invested with the"
15461,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"responsibility of acting for the whole body, and thus grows to be as"
15462,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"well its representative and organ in all external relations, as also"
15463,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the representative of its inward life: or when some conquering dynasty
15464,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,and host have by the strong hand entered in upon prior occupants of
15465,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"the soil, and, reducing them to dependence or to servitude more or"
15466,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"less qualified, or narrowing the circle of their possessions, have"
15467,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"taken into their own custody, together with the best lands of the"
15468,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"country, the whole range of public affairs, and have imposed laws"
15469,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"upon the vanquished, and imparted to them manners. In this case, the"
15470,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"different elements are welded into a political unity, by a power"
15471,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,proceeding from that race which among them has possessed the greater
15472,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,physical and martial force. But unless there be more than the merely
15473,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"convulsive effort of conquest, unless deep roots be struck into the"
15474,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"soil, and sharper furrows drawn upon it than the spear alone can"
15475,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"carve, or than the wave of a mere deluge traces, unless, in a word,"
15476,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"there be a predominant organizing faculty, the effect will not be"
15477,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,permanent; and the crude mass of mere strength will sink down amid the
15478,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"surrounding milder, but more enduring and more prevailing impulses."
15479,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"In some instances it has been so: the body, which has been stronger"
15480,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"in the hand, has proved weaker in the intellectual and moral, that"
15481,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"is to say, the enduring, elements of power. The undying yet daily"
15482,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"influences and sympathies of peace wear down the convulsive vibrations,"
15483,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,which the shock of war and conquest have communicated to the social
15484,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"fabric. Victory must end in possession, like toil in sleep. Possession"
15485,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"implies the dispersion of the conquerors, and, in such cases as these,"
15486,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"their free intermixture with the vanquished. Ties of neighbourhood,"
15487,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"of commerce, of marriage, ties belonging to all the transactions of"
15488,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"life, are gradually multiplied between the new comers and the old;"
15489,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"and by a gentle process, experience and opinion gradually decide, not"
15490,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"imperiously in the spirit of party, but insensibly for the benefit of"
15491,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"all, what laws, what manners, what language[763], what religion shall"
15492,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,predominate. The fate of the name follows that of the institutions and
15493,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,habits with which it was connected; and the old designation prevails
15494,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,"ultimately over the new, or the new over the old, in proportion as the"
15495,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,older inhabitants have contributed a larger or a smaller share towards
15496,ΑΙΤΕϜΕΠΟΣ ΑΙΤΕϜΑΡΓΟΝ,the common national life resulting from the combination; in proportion

15826,SECT. IX.,

15828,SECT. IX.,_Difference between Epithets and Titles._
15829,SECT. IX.,
15830,SECT. IX.,"Both in modern society, and in the forms of modern language, the"
15831,SECT. IX.,"distinction is a familiar one, which separates between descriptive"
15832,SECT. IX.,"affixes or epithets, and titles properly so called."
15833,SECT. IX.,
15834,SECT. IX.,"A descriptive affix, be it substantive, like Δαναοὶ αἰχμηταὶ, or"
15835,SECT. IX.,"adjective, like Δαναοὶ φιλοπτόλεμοι, describes a quality, and"
15836,SECT. IX.,"challenges from the reader, like any other phrase conveying an idea,"
15837,SECT. IX.,assent to the justice of its description. These descriptive affixes
15838,SECT. IX.,"have a tendency, from repeated use, to grow into _formulæ_, and then at"
15839,SECT. IX.,length they approximate to the nature of titles.
15840,SECT. IX.,
15841,SECT. IX.,But a title is quite a different thing from a descriptive affix. A
15842,SECT. IX.,"title is the current coin of language, which is intended to pass from"
15843,SECT. IX.,"mouth to mouth without examination. It is like a pronoun, having for"
15844,SECT. IX.,"its office simply to indicate, or to stand for, a particular person. It"
15845,SECT. IX.,"is the index of a rank or office, a thing determinate in its nature,"
15846,SECT. IX.,"like an unit of number: and it has no relation, when once fixed as a"
15847,SECT. IX.,"title, to personal character, though in its origin it may have been"
15848,SECT. IX.,founded on the real or presumed existence of personal qualities. Like a
15849,SECT. IX.,"descriptive affix, a title may be either adjective, as ‘most noble,’ or"
15850,SECT. IX.,"substantive, as ‘marquis.’"
15851,SECT. IX.,
15852,SECT. IX.,Titles evidently presume a certain progress in the organization of
15853,SECT. IX.,"political society; while descriptive epithets must be used, in order to"
15854,SECT. IX.,"meet the purposes of human speech, even in its first stages."
15855,SECT. IX.,
15856,SECT. IX.,This degree of progress must have been attained in the time of Homer;
15857,SECT. IX.,"for the use of titles in the poems, as well as of descriptive"
15858,SECT. IX.,"epithets, can be clearly made out."
15859,SECT. IX.,
15860,SECT. IX.,"Among the descriptive epithets of Homer we find, of substantives,"
15861,SECT. IX.,"ἡγεμόνες, ἀριστῆες, and also βασιλεῖς, ἀοιδοί. Of adjectives, applied"
15862,SECT. IX.,"to classes, σκηπτοῦχοι (βασιλῆες), ὑπερμενέες (βασιλῆες), θεῖοι"
15863,SECT. IX.,"(ἀοιδοί): and applied to persons, ἐχεφρὼν Πηνελόπεια, Τηλέμαχος"
15864,SECT. IX.,"πεπνυμένος, πολύμητις Ὀδύσσευς: and many more."
15865,SECT. IX.,
15866,SECT. IX.,"In modern phraseology, duke, earl, baron, knight, esquire, are titles:"
15867,SECT. IX.,"nobles, clergy, freeholders, burgesses, are descriptive phrases. Of a"
15868,SECT. IX.,"descriptive epithet or affix which has grown to be a title, we may find"
15869,SECT. IX.,instances among those just cited; knight (_knecht_) meant originally
15870,SECT. IX.,"a servant, then a person performing particular service to the king;"
15871,SECT. IX.,"and esquire (_scudiero_, _écuyer_) meant a person who bore the arms"
15872,SECT. IX.,"of a knight, particularly his shield. In process of time these became"
15873,SECT. IX.,"titles. Again, words may hang doubtfully upon the confine between title"
15874,SECT. IX.,and epithet; as the much criticised expressions of the English Common
15875,SECT. IX.,"Prayer Book, ‘(our) most religious and gracious (king).’"
15876,SECT. IX.,
15877,SECT. IX.,"We find in Homer that the word βασιλεὺς, a king, had already begun to"
15878,SECT. IX.,pass from the function of a mere descriptive word towards that of a
15879,SECT. IX.,"title; for, though rarely, he attaches it to the names of individuals,"
15880,SECT. IX.,besides freely using it without them; and it is an usual note of
15881,SECT. IX.,"titles properly so called, that they can, even if substantives, either"
15882,SECT. IX.,"be combined with the name of the person, or, in addressing them,"
15883,SECT. IX.,"substituted for it. In the Iliad we find Ἀλεξάνδρῳ βασιλῆι, and in the"
15884,SECT. IX.,"Odyssey Ἔχετον βασιλῆα. Again, we find βασίλεια used in the Odyssey in"
15885,SECT. IX.,"the vocative[764], which in like manner marks it as a title."
15886,SECT. IX.,
15887,SECT. IX.,"The word ἄναξ, again, in Homer, which must on no account be confounded"
15888,SECT. IX.,"with βασιλεὺς[765], is commonly a descriptive epithet, nearly"
15889,SECT. IX.,"equivalent to our word _lord_, and, like it, having an extraordinary"
15890,SECT. IX.,"elasticity of sense; for as a person may now be lord, so he might then"
15891,SECT. IX.,"be ἄναξ, of a kingdom, a people, a field, a mine, a slave, a horse,"
15892,SECT. IX.,"or a dog. Instances are countless. Sometimes the meaning is lord, or"
15893,SECT. IX.,"master, relatively to a particular object, as of the horses of Nestor,"
15894,SECT. IX.,
15895,SECT. IX.,οἱ δὲ ἄνακτος ὑποδδείσαντες ὁμοκλὴν....[766]
15896,SECT. IX.,
15897,SECT. IX.,"Sometimes it means in the abstract a class of persons,"
15898,SECT. IX.,
15899,SECT. IX.,οἷοί τε ἀνάκτων παῖδες ἔασιν.[767]
15900,SECT. IX.,
15901,SECT. IX.,where the ἀνάκτων παῖδες nearly corresponds with our ‘children of the
15902,SECT. IX.,"higher orders,’ i.e. the masters of slaves."
15903,SECT. IX.,
15904,SECT. IX.,"On the other hand, in reference to the immortals, ἄναξ is sometimes a"
15905,SECT. IX.,"title: as in Il. xvi. 233,"
15906,SECT. IX.,
15907,SECT. IX.,"Ζεῦ ἄνα, Δωδώναιε, Πελασγικέ."
15908,SECT. IX.,
15909,SECT. IX.,_Examples of titles._
15910,SECT. IX.,
15911,SECT. IX.,"There are, however, in Homer various words which are undoubtedly and"
15912,SECT. IX.,uniformly titular. Such are in particular the adjectives Διοτρεφὴς
15913,SECT. IX.,"and Διογενὴς, which are very nearly equivalent in power to the phrase"
15914,SECT. IX.,‘Royal Highness’ of the present day. They commonly accompany the name
15915,SECT. IX.,"of the individual, or of the class, to which they belong: and they are"
15916,SECT. IX.,"confined, with one single exception, in the Iliad, to persons of the"
15917,SECT. IX.,"highest known rank, that of βασιλεὺς or king. The exception is Phœnix,"
15918,SECT. IX.,who is in one place addressed by Achilles as γέραιε Διοτρεφές. But
15919,SECT. IX.,"Achilles says this χαριζόμενος, when petting and coaxing the old man,"
15920,SECT. IX.,and therefore the instance does not destroy the force of the general
15921,SECT. IX.,rule.
15922,SECT. IX.,
15923,SECT. IX.,In one place we have ὁ Διογενὴς[768] used for Achilles in the third
15924,SECT. IX.,person without his name: which still more strikingly marks the word
15925,SECT. IX.,"as a title. Also Διοτρεφὴς is not unfrequently used in the vocative,"
15926,SECT. IX.,"without, as well as with, the name of the person to whom it is"
15927,SECT. IX.,"addressed. It may possibly be worth notice, that these words, Διοτρεφὴς"
15928,SECT. IX.,"and Διογενὴς, are never applied to Agamemnon, as if they had, again"
15929,SECT. IX.,"like the phrase ‘Royal Highness,’ a limit upwards as well as downwards,"
15930,SECT. IX.,and were not applicable to the supreme head of the nation. There is
15931,SECT. IX.,"indeed one passage where Agamemnon is addressed as Διοτρεφὴς, but it is"
15932,SECT. IX.,in the universally suspected[769] νεκυΐα of the Twenty-fourth Odyssey.
15933,SECT. IX.,"Plainly this fact cannot be referred to metrical considerations, even"
15934,SECT. IX.,"as to Διοτρεφὴς, because either in the genitive, or in the vocative,"
15935,SECT. IX.,it would easily have been made available: especially in the latter
15936,SECT. IX.,"inflexion, for Agamemnon is addressed vocatively some five and twenty"
15937,SECT. IX.,"times in the poems. I admit that Ulysses may allude to him in the line,"
15938,SECT. IX.,
15939,SECT. IX.,θυμὸς δὲ μέγας ἐστὶ Διοτρεφέος βασιλῆος[770].
15940,SECT. IX.,
15941,SECT. IX.,But the phrase here is more abstract than personal: it is perhaps as we
15942,SECT. IX.,"should say, ‘our royal master.’"
15943,SECT. IX.,
15944,SECT. IX.,The word βασιλεὺς may have borne originally a merely descriptive
15945,SECT. IX.,character. But it has only partial traces of that character still
15946,SECT. IX.,"adhering to it, as it is used in the Iliad. The chief note of such a"
15947,SECT. IX.,"sense, that I can find, is, that it is used in the comparative and"
15948,SECT. IX.,superlative to distinguish the Pelopid house from the other kings.
15949,SECT. IX.,"Agamemnon is βασιλεύτατος, Il. ix. 69, and Menelaus is evidently"
15950,SECT. IX.,intended in the βασιλεύτερος of Il. x. 239; where Diomed is bidden to
15951,SECT. IX.,"choose the best man, irrespectively of rank, and not to tie himself to"
15952,SECT. IX.,the βασιλεύτερος.
15953,SECT. IX.,
15954,SECT. IX.,"As the Odyssey represents a period of political disorganization,"
15955,SECT. IX.,"brought about by the long absence of the chiefs, it is not surprising"
15956,SECT. IX.,"that we find the word βασιλεὺς, and its proper epithet Διοτρεφὴς, used"
15957,SECT. IX.,"in this poem with greater laxity. The βασιλῆες and the Διοτρεφεῖς[771],"
15958,SECT. IX.,"are here not the kings but the aristocracy of Scheria, and of the"
15959,SECT. IX.,dominions of Ulysses: and it is a compliment paid to Telemachus by
15960,SECT. IX.,"Theoclymenus, when he says[772],"
15961,SECT. IX.,
15962,SECT. IX.,ὑμετέρου δ’ οὐκ ἔστι γένος βασιλεύτερον ἄλλο
15963,SECT. IX.,ἐν δημῷ Ἰθάκης.
15964,SECT. IX.,
15965,SECT. IX.,Yet even here the special and official sense of βασιλεὺς remains: no
15966,SECT. IX.,"one is ever called individually a βασιλεὺς unless he is on the throne,"
15967,SECT. IX.,"though Antinous is said to resemble one of the king-class,"
15968,SECT. IX.,
15969,SECT. IX.,βασιλῆι γὰρ ἀνδρὶ ἔοικας[773].
15970,SECT. IX.,
15971,SECT. IX.,"And the same Antinous sarcastically expresses his hope, that Jupiter"
15972,SECT. IX.,"will not make Telemachus βασιλεὺς in Ithaca, notwithstanding his right"
15973,SECT. IX.,of succession by birth[774]. If βασιλεὺς only indicated a certain
15974,SECT. IX.,"station, Telemachus without doubt was βασιλεὺς already."
15975,SECT. IX.,
15976,SECT. IX.,"The sense proper to it in Homer is that in which, for some thousands of"
15977,SECT. IX.,"years, it appears to have maintained a world-wide celebrity."
15978,SECT. IX.,
15979,SECT. IX.,_Common interpretations of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν._
15980,SECT. IX.,
15981,SECT. IX.,And now as respects the constructions which have been put upon the
15982,SECT. IX.,phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. It is not noticed by Heyne or by Crusius. Of the
15983,SECT. IX.,"translators I have already spoken. As regards the Lexicographers,"
15984,SECT. IX.,Scott and Liddell say ‘Agamemnon _as general-in-chief_ is specially
15985,SECT. IX.,"ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, while Orsilochos is called ἄναξ ἄνδρεσσιν in Il. v."
15986,SECT. IX.,"546;’ but the phrase is πολέεσσ’ ἄνδρεσσιν ἄνακτα, which I take to be"
15987,SECT. IX.,"simply equivalent to ἀνάσσοντα, and to have no relation to a phrase or"
15988,SECT. IX.,_formula_.
15989,SECT. IX.,
15990,SECT. IX.,Damm[775] says it indicates supreme dignity united with military
15991,SECT. IX.,command.
15992,SECT. IX.,
15993,SECT. IX.,"Again; Mure[776] remarks, that in common with ποιμὴν λαῶν and κρείων,"
15994,SECT. IX.,"‘it denotes the office of any king or chieftain, but more particularly"
15995,SECT. IX.,that of a supreme ruler or commander.’
15996,SECT. IX.,
15997,SECT. IX.,"That these explanations are entirely beside the mark, I am convinced"
15998,SECT. IX.,after a somewhat minute consideration.
15999,SECT. IX.,
16000,SECT. IX.,"In answer to Damm, I would observe that the phrase was applied to"
16001,SECT. IX.,"Æneas, who was a commander, but not a sovereign: it was applied to"
16002,SECT. IX.,"Anchises, who was a sovereign, but not a commander; it was applied to"
16003,SECT. IX.,"Eumelus, who was neither a sovereign, nor a warrior of any note, and"
16004,SECT. IX.,who commanded no more than eleven ships.
16005,SECT. IX.,
16006,SECT. IX.,It does not then depend upon the highest degree either of military or
16007,SECT. IX.,of civil elevation.
16008,SECT. IX.,
16009,SECT. IX.,"Nor does it in all cases attach to divine descent, even though that"
16010,SECT. IX.,descent be from Jupiter; nor even if it be immediate or next to
16011,SECT. IX.,"immediate: as among the living, Sarpedon the son of Jupiter has it not,"
16012,SECT. IX.,"neither has Polypœtes his grandson (Il. ii. 740). So, among the dead,"
16013,SECT. IX.,"it is not given either to Hercules or to Rhadamanthus[777], sons of"
16014,SECT. IX.,"Jupiter. If, as is probable, reputed extraction from Jupiter in all"
16015,SECT. IX.,"cases attached to it, it was a remote and not a near extraction, and"
16016,SECT. IX.,thus the title was the ornament of an antique lineage; certainly divine
16017,SECT. IX.,descent was not the immediate qualification for the particular dignity.
16018,SECT. IX.,
16019,SECT. IX.,"I do not dispute, that an idea of divine descent attaches generally and"
16020,SECT. IX.,"immediately to sovereigns as such, at least in the Iliad. But this is"
16021,SECT. IX.,"represented by the words Διοτρεφὴς and Διογενὴς, as they bear witness"
16022,SECT. IX.,"by their etymology, and not by ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Indeed we seem to find the"
16023,SECT. IX.,"word Διοτρεφὴς used for heaven-born, without reference to political"
16024,SECT. IX.,"power, in that line of the Odyssey (v. 378), where Neptune applies it"
16025,SECT. IX.,to the Phæacians:
16026,SECT. IX.,
16027,SECT. IX.,εἰσόκεν ἀνθρώποισι Διοτρεφέεσσι μιγείης.
16028,SECT. IX.,
16029,SECT. IX.,"But of those Homeric titles which are specifically Greek, by far the"
16030,SECT. IX.,most remarkable is the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.
16031,SECT. IX.,
16032,SECT. IX.,_Particulars of its use._
16033,SECT. IX.,
16034,SECT. IX.,"It is used by the Poet fifty-two times: fifty times in the Iliad, twice"
16035,SECT. IX.,only in the Odyssey.
16036,SECT. IX.,
16037,SECT. IX.,"It is applied forty-six times to Agamemnon, and six times to five other"
16038,SECT. IX.,"persons, once for each in four cases, and twice in one. The persons are,"
16039,SECT. IX.,
16040,SECT. IX.,"Eumelus, a living Greek."
16041,SECT. IX.,
16042,SECT. IX.,"Augeias,  }"
16043,SECT. IX.,} dead Greeks.
16044,SECT. IX.,"Euphetes, }"
16045,SECT. IX.,
16046,SECT. IX.,"Anchises, }"
16047,SECT. IX.,} living Trojans.
16048,SECT. IX.,"Æneas,    }"
16049,SECT. IX.,
16050,SECT. IX.,"It appears and perishes with Homer, not being found in the writings of"
16051,SECT. IX.,any other Greek author.
16052,SECT. IX.,
16053,SECT. IX.,"It is never used in any of the cases, except the nominative: never"
16054,SECT. IX.,"separated from the proper name of the person to whom it is applied,"
16055,SECT. IX.,"except once (Il. i. 7), and then only by the particle τε: it always"
16056,SECT. IX.,precedes the name except in that single passage: it always ends with
16057,SECT. IX.,"the first half of the fifth foot of the verse, except in that same"
16058,SECT. IX.,"passage: and again, the word ἄναξ is never separated from the word"
16059,SECT. IX.,"ἀνδρῶν, except once in the Odyssey by the word δέ."
16060,SECT. IX.,
16061,SECT. IX.,"It is applied to no person whose name does not begin with a vowel,"
16062,SECT. IX.,and to no person whose name is not of the metrical value necessary
16063,SECT. IX.,"to enable it to form the last foot and a half of the hexameter: as,"
16064,SECT. IX.,"Agamemnon, of two short syllables and two long ones; Euphetes, three"
16065,SECT. IX.,"long ones; Eumelus, two long and one short. Circumstances, these last,"
16066,SECT. IX.,"which, if they stood alone, would raise a presumption that the use of"
16067,SECT. IX.,it was determined by metrical considerations only.
16068,SECT. IX.,
16069,SECT. IX.,That metrical considerations had some degree of influence on the use of
16070,SECT. IX.,"phrases in Homer, we may sufficiently judge, by observing that while"
16071,SECT. IX.,"Homer uses the name of Achæans four times for that of Argeians once, he"
16072,SECT. IX.,"uses the forms Ἀχαίοισι and Ἀχαίοισιν but twelve times, whereas he uses"
16073,SECT. IX.,Ἀργείοισι and Ἀργείοισιν more than sixty times.
16074,SECT. IX.,
16075,SECT. IX.,But we may observe that no metrical considerations could have prevented
16076,SECT. IX.,"Homer from applying the phrase to Diomedes, Polypœtes, or others, whose"
16077,SECT. IX.,names differ from that of Agamemnon only in having a consonant at the
16078,SECT. IX.,beginning of them: and yet he has not done this: the names of all his
16079,SECT. IX.,six ἄνακτες ἀνδρῶν begin with a vowel. Thus as he restrains himself
16080,SECT. IX.,"beyond what metre requires, he may have had some reason other than"
16081,SECT. IX.,metre to govern his use of the title.
16082,SECT. IX.,
16083,SECT. IX.,"The question is, whether there are, evidently or probably, other"
16084,SECT. IX.,"conditions of substance, which, besides these of sound, meet in the"
16085,SECT. IX.,"persons designated by the title, and which enable us to trace and fix"
16086,SECT. IX.,its purport?
16087,SECT. IX.,
16088,SECT. IX.,"With reference to Mure’s explanation I observe, that it does not"
16089,SECT. IX.,appear to take account of the difference between descriptive words in
16090,SECT. IX.,"general, and titles, as applicable to Homer; but rather to assume that"
16091,SECT. IX.,the Homeric phrases are simply of the former class.
16092,SECT. IX.,
16093,SECT. IX.,"It is plain that the word κρείων is a term of that class only: which,"
16094,SECT. IX.,"_pro tanto_, is indicated by its relationship to the established and"
16095,SECT. IX.,ordinary epithet of comparison κρείσσων. It clearly describes the class
16096,SECT. IX.,"of those, who bore single-handed rule, in the address to Jupiter, ὕπατε"
16097,SECT. IX.,κρειόντων[778]; and it answers to the epithet princely in Il. xxiv. 538.
16098,SECT. IX.,
16099,SECT. IX.,ὅττι οἱ οὔτι
16100,SECT. IX.,Παίδων ἐν μεγάροισι γονὴ γένετο κρειόντων.
16101,SECT. IX.,
16102,SECT. IX.,‘For he had not as yet a princely offspring in his home.’
16103,SECT. IX.,
16104,SECT. IX.,"Lower than Βασιλεὺς, which corresponds to the rank implied by our term"
16105,SECT. IX.,"‘majesty,’ and less wide in sense than ἄναξ, which corresponds very"
16106,SECT. IX.,"nearly with ‘lord,’ it is generally the equivalent as to rank of prince"
16107,SECT. IX.,"or princely, according to the English sense of the terms; but it is in"
16108,SECT. IX.,"Homer always a descriptive word only, and never a title. Accordingly it"
16109,SECT. IX.,"is found in the later Greek writers, when both ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, and even"
16110,SECT. IX.,ποιμὴν λαῶν have disappeared.
16111,SECT. IX.,
16112,SECT. IX.,_The ποιμὴν λαῶν of Homer._
16113,SECT. IX.,
16114,SECT. IX.,"The phrase ποιμὴν λαῶν is more largely used than κρείων, and with"
16115,SECT. IX.,"more appearance of approximation to that substantive character, and"
16116,SECT. IX.,"susceptibility of individual application, which belongs to a title."
16117,SECT. IX.,Thus in
16118,SECT. IX.,
16119,SECT. IX.,"Οἱ δ’ ἐπανέστησαν, πείθοντό τε ποιμένι λαῶν,"
16120,SECT. IX.,"σκηπτοῦχοι βασιλῆες[779],"
16121,SECT. IX.,
16122,SECT. IX.,"the βασιλῆες are the members of the Greek βουλὴ, and ποιμὴν λαῶν means"
16123,SECT. IX.,"Agamemnon. Like κρείων, it was applicable to those who held secondary"
16124,SECT. IX.,"sovereignties, the feudatories, so to speak, of the principal chiefs:"
16125,SECT. IX.,"as for instance, we find among the secondary commanders of the Pylian"
16126,SECT. IX.,"division,"
16127,SECT. IX.,
16128,SECT. IX.,"Αἵμονά τε κρείοντα, Βίαντά τε, ποιμένα λαῶν[780]."
16129,SECT. IX.,
16130,SECT. IX.,"It reaches down to persons, of whom we know and can infer nothing,"
16131,SECT. IX.,but that they may probably have held small fiefs (so to call them)
16132,SECT. IX.,"with derivative sovereignty of some kind, such as were, among the"
16133,SECT. IX.,"Trojans[781], Bienor, Hypeiron, Apisaon, Hypsenor: and it is also"
16134,SECT. IX.,"applied to the sons of the greater chiefs, for example, Thrasymedes and"
16135,SECT. IX.,"Agenor[782], as well as to the chiefs themselves, including Agamemnon."
16136,SECT. IX.,"It is likewise given to Ægisthus, when he was, _de facto_, in"
16137,SECT. IX.,possession of the throne of Agamemnon[783]. It is therefore applicable
16138,SECT. IX.,"to the idea of political rule in the very widest sense, differing"
16139,SECT. IX.,"however from ἄναξ in so far that, while it is assigned to personages of"
16140,SECT. IX.,"smaller note politically, it is confined to the expression of that kind"
16141,SECT. IX.,"of superiority, and has nothing whatever to do with property."
16142,SECT. IX.,
16143,SECT. IX.,"I find it, on the whole, impossible to detect in this phrase any thing"
16144,SECT. IX.,"of a definite character, except that it expresses political rule at"
16145,SECT. IX.,"large, and expresses it under the form of a figure adapted to the early"
16146,SECT. IX.,and patriarchal state of society. I hesitate then to call it with
16147,SECT. IX.,"confidence a title, because the class to which it applies is somewhat"
16148,SECT. IX.,"indeterminate, and therefore it is wanting in specific meaning: yet it"
16149,SECT. IX.,"may partake somewhat of that character. We must, however, distinguish"
16150,SECT. IX.,"broadly between the element of subordination to Agamemnon, such as we"
16151,SECT. IX.,"see it in Nestor and Diomed, and that of the class to which the lower"
16152,SECT. IX.,ποιμένες λαῶν belonged. These were as widely separated as the great
16153,SECT. IX.,"feudatories of mediæval France, from the petty lords who so much"
16154,SECT. IX.,abounded in this island.
16155,SECT. IX.,
16156,SECT. IX.,"In its form, the phrase bears an external, rather than a real"
16157,SECT. IX.,resemblance to ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. For ποίμην figuratively used expresses
16158,SECT. IX.,no more than the office of a ruler in his political relation to his
16159,SECT. IX.,"subjects; while ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν is much more peculiar in character, since"
16160,SECT. IX.,"ἄναξ exhibits the idea of master as well as ruler, and he is not"
16161,SECT. IX.,"merely ἄναξ of a people, but ἄναξ of individual men, in respect to"
16162,SECT. IX.,"something appertaining to man as such, of which he is the possessor or"
16163,SECT. IX.,"usufructuary. The ποιμὴν λαῶν expresses a relation, which implies that"
16164,SECT. IX.,"political society is already formed, for λαὸς means a body united in"
16165,SECT. IX.,that form.
16166,SECT. IX.,
16167,SECT. IX.,"Again, we are scarcely entitled to presume that ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν denotes"
16168,SECT. IX.,"the office of ‘any king or chieftain,’ when, though it is used in some"
16169,SECT. IX.,"fifty passages, it is only applied to six persons: nor is it less"
16170,SECT. IX.,hazardous to say that it means especially the office of a supreme ruler
16171,SECT. IX.,"or commander, when out of these six persons only one at all answers to"
16172,SECT. IX.,"that description, and when at least three are persons of insignificant"
16173,SECT. IX.,"power, as well as individually obscure."
16174,SECT. IX.,
16175,SECT. IX.,"Once more, it is the manner of Homer, where he applies an epithet or"
16176,SECT. IX.,"phrase characteristically to one of his greater personages, to give"
16177,SECT. IX.,"them the exclusive use of it, such as the ποδωκὴς δῖος for Achilles,"
16178,SECT. IX.,"κορυθαίολος for Hector, πολύμητις and πολυτλὰς δῖος for Ulysses. For"
16179,SECT. IX.,"example, κορυθαίολος is used thirty-eight times for Hector, never for"
16180,SECT. IX.,"any other hero: though it is used once for Mars, in Il. xx. 38. It"
16181,SECT. IX.,would be strange if he departed from this usage in the case before
16182,SECT. IX.,"us. But if ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν be a mere phrase of description, as Mure"
16183,SECT. IX.,"supposes, he does depart from it in the strangest manner; for while"
16184,SECT. IX.,"he applies it forty-six times to Agamemnon, he likewise gives it to"
16185,SECT. IX.,the very insignificant Eumelus. If it be a phrase simply serving the
16186,SECT. IX.,"purpose, as an epithet would, of denoting the great political position"
16187,SECT. IX.,"of Agamemnon, how can its force be more utterly shattered than by"
16188,SECT. IX.,"bestowing it not only upon Eumelus, who does nothing except drive a"
16189,SECT. IX.,"chariot, but upon Euphetes, who is mentioned but once in the poems of"
16190,SECT. IX.,"Homer, without any epithet or circumstance whatever except this to"
16191,SECT. IX.,"distinguish him, and who is named nowhere else at all? If it describes"
16192,SECT. IX.,"a ruler as supreme among rulers, why is it thus debasingly, as well as"
16193,SECT. IX.,"loosely, applied? But if it describes a ruler generally, then why is"
16194,SECT. IX.,it employed so restrictedly? The actual mode and conditions of its use
16195,SECT. IX.,require us to examine whether it does not in fact cover some specific
16196,SECT. IX.,"idea, derived from a form of society which, even in the days of Homer,"
16197,SECT. IX.,"had become, or, at the least, was becoming obsolete; perhaps already"
16198,SECT. IX.,"in some part a monument of the past, and cutting across, rather than"
16199,SECT. IX.,"fitting into, the arrangements and usages of his time."
16200,SECT. IX.,
16201,SECT. IX.,_Ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν has a specific meaning._
16202,SECT. IX.,
16203,SECT. IX.,The peculiar formula ‘lord of men’ appears well adapted to mark the
16204,SECT. IX.,period of transition from the patriarchal to the political construction
16205,SECT. IX.,"of society; in the family, sovereignty and the possession of property"
16206,SECT. IX.,"are united, and the βασιλεὺς naturally follows after and grows out of"
16207,SECT. IX.,the ἄναξ. Authority is here clothed in a form more extended than that
16208,SECT. IX.,"of a mere family connection, yet the idea of it remains indeterminate:"
16209,SECT. IX.,there is no distinct formation of _class_; superiors are not yet viewed
16210,SECT. IX.,"under the formal political notion of kings, nor (as in λαὸς) have _men_"
16211,SECT. IX.,yet come to conceive of themselves as subjects. There are human beings
16212,SECT. IX.,with a superior: but there is no society with a head. In that state of
16213,SECT. IX.,"things, power, if less secure and rooted, was more absolute: witness"
16214,SECT. IX.,the projected sacrifice by Abraham of his son Isaac.
16215,SECT. IX.,
16216,SECT. IX.,"To sum up, however, what we have said upon the other phrases, it"
16217,SECT. IX.,appears that we have in Homer four words commonly used to express the
16218,SECT. IX.,"ruling office, from the highest form of that office downwards: they are,"
16219,SECT. IX.,
16220,SECT. IX.,"1. βασιλεὺς, the most limited: confined in the Iliad to those who"
16221,SECT. IX.,"both were practically supreme, and ruled over considerable territory,"
16222,SECT. IX.,or else were of primary importance from personal prowess or other
16223,SECT. IX.,qualities.
16224,SECT. IX.,
16225,SECT. IX.,"2. κρείων, the next; embracing the very highest, but descending to"
16226,SECT. IX.,"secondary princes, though commonly confined to the more considerable."
16227,SECT. IX.,
16228,SECT. IX.,"3. ποιμὴν λαῶν, which, also capable of application to the highest,"
16229,SECT. IX.,"yet, as expressing political dominion in the widest form, embraces the"
16230,SECT. IX.,"subordinate, derivative, and petty principalities even of persons who"
16231,SECT. IX.,do not appear to have been in any sense independent sovereigns.
16232,SECT. IX.,
16233,SECT. IX.,"4. More varied in its application than any of these, perhaps older, and"
16234,SECT. IX.,related to the time when the only known form of sovereignty implied
16235,SECT. IX.,"indeterminate, and so far absolute powers of disposal, the word ἄναξ"
16236,SECT. IX.,involves the double idea of political authority and of ownership; it
16237,SECT. IX.,"accompanies them both, like our word _lord_, when they separate, and it"
16238,SECT. IX.,adheres to each of them in all its forms.
16239,SECT. IX.,
16240,SECT. IX.,I admit that the construction which it is now proposed to put upon
16241,SECT. IX.,"ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν has not, so far as I am aware, been heretofore propounded;"
16242,SECT. IX.,"and that this is, _pro tanto_, a presumption against it. But in lieu"
16243,SECT. IX.,"of _pro tanto_, I would in this case crave to write _pro tantillo_;"
16244,SECT. IX.,"for it seems to be the fact, that, as only of late has Ethnology been"
16245,SECT. IX.,"systematically studied, so only of late have the text and diction of"
16246,SECT. IX.,Homer been subjected to minute investigation; and it is reasonable to
16247,SECT. IX.,"expect, that the further application of critical attention to it may"
16248,SECT. IX.,"yet disclose to our view much, which has heretofore been unsuspected."
16249,SECT. IX.,It is the more allowable to proceed upon this view in the case of ἄναξ
16250,SECT. IX.,"ἀνδρῶν, because so few readers of Homer appear even to have observed"
16251,SECT. IX.,"that it is ever applied to any person besides Agamemnon, and therefore"
16252,SECT. IX.,the common opinion rests upon an inaccurate impression as to the
16253,SECT. IX.,"elementary facts. My purpose, accordingly, may more justly be described"
16254,SECT. IX.,"as an attempt to open a new question, than as an attack upon a critical"
16255,SECT. IX.,verdict regularly delivered.
16256,SECT. IX.,
16257,SECT. IX.,Let us now proceed to examine what the facts really are respecting the
16258,SECT. IX.,use of the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν in Homer.
16259,SECT. IX.,
16260,SECT. IX.,_Persons to whom it is applied._
16261,SECT. IX.,
16262,SECT. IX.,It is applied to Agamemnon in the following passages:
16263,SECT. IX.,
16264,SECT. IX.,"Il. i. 7, 172, 442, 506."
16265,SECT. IX.,"ii. 402, 434, 441, 612."
16266,SECT. IX.,"iii. 81, 267, 455."
16267,SECT. IX.,"iv. 148, 255, 336."
16268,SECT. IX.,v. 38.
16269,SECT. IX.,vi. 33.
16270,SECT. IX.,"vii. 162, 314."
16271,SECT. IX.,viii. 278.
16272,SECT. IX.,"ix. 96, 114, 163, 672, 677, 697."
16273,SECT. IX.,"x. 64, 86, 103, 119, 233."
16274,SECT. IX.,"xi. 99, 254."
16275,SECT. IX.,"xiv. 64, 103, 134."
16276,SECT. IX.,xviii. 111.
16277,SECT. IX.,"xix. 51, 76, 146, 172, 184, 199."
16278,SECT. IX.,"xxiii. 161, 895."
16279,SECT. IX.,
16280,SECT. IX.,Od. viii. 77.
16281,SECT. IX.,xi. 396.
16282,SECT. IX.,
16283,SECT. IX.,It is also applied to
16284,SECT. IX.,
16285,SECT. IX.,"Anchises, Il. v. 268."
16286,SECT. IX.,"Æneas, Il. v. 311."
16287,SECT. IX.,"Augeias, Il. xi. 701, 739."
16288,SECT. IX.,"Euphetes, Il. xv. 532."
16289,SECT. IX.,"Eumelus, Il. xxiii. 288."
16290,SECT. IX.,
16291,SECT. IX.,"Now although, as we have seen, the term is in fact employed only with"
16292,SECT. IX.,"names nearly akin to one another in point of metrical value, yet the"
16293,SECT. IX.,Poet has given us the most distinct evidence that the employment of
16294,SECT. IX.,it was not a mere metrical expedient to assist him in the use of names
16295,SECT. IX.,otherwise unmanageable. This we learn in the two following forms:
16296,SECT. IX.,
16297,SECT. IX.,1. The name Eumelus is one of those to which he applies the phrase:
16298,SECT. IX.,but the metrical conjunction of it with this name is by no means
16299,SECT. IX.,"particularly convenient, for out of five places in which Homer mentions"
16300,SECT. IX.,"Eumelus in the nominative case, he only once gives him his title of"
16301,SECT. IX.,"ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Again, it is evident that he has no preference for the"
16302,SECT. IX.,end of the verse as a place for the name of Eumelus; for he places it
16303,SECT. IX.,"elsewhere, at the beginning, and in τὴν Εὔμηλος ὄπυιε (Il. ii. 714. Od."
16304,SECT. IX.,"iv. 798), on the only two occasions when he uses the nominative without"
16305,SECT. IX.,a title annexed. He only puts it at the end of the verse in order to
16306,SECT. IX.,"couple it with ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, and with κρείων (Il. xxiii. 288, 354). So"
16307,SECT. IX.,"far then from being a metrical convenience, this phrase rather forces"
16308,SECT. IX.,him out of his way in order to introduce it. So it is with Æneas. Homer
16309,SECT. IX.,"uses his name very many times, but never once places it at the end of a"
16310,SECT. IX.,"verse, except in the single case in which he attaches it to the title"
16311,SECT. IX.,"ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Again, then, the phrase compels him to adopt a position"
16312,SECT. IX.,"which he is uniformly careful to avoid elsewhere for Æneas, and this in"
16313,SECT. IX.,little short of forty instances.
16314,SECT. IX.,
16315,SECT. IX.,_Persons to whom it might have been applied._
16316,SECT. IX.,
16317,SECT. IX.,"2. Besides the names to which Homer applies the phrase, he employs"
16318,SECT. IX.,"a great number of names, of persons having high or the very highest"
16319,SECT. IX.,"rank, which possess exactly the same metrical value as one or another"
16320,SECT. IX.,of the six names above quoted; but yet to none of these does he at any
16321,SECT. IX.,time give the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Of such names I have observed the
16322,SECT. IX.,following: and I exclude from the list the merely local characters of
16323,SECT. IX.,"the Odyssey, and all persons in inferior station."
16324,SECT. IX.,
16325,SECT. IX.,(1) Of the same metrical value with Eumelus:
16326,SECT. IX.,
16327,SECT. IX.,Patroclus.
16328,SECT. IX.,Pheidippus.
16329,SECT. IX.,Euneus.
16330,SECT. IX.,Eudorus.
16331,SECT. IX.,Euphemus.
16332,SECT. IX.,Ægisthus.
16333,SECT. IX.,Admetus.
16334,SECT. IX.,Amphius.
16335,SECT. IX.,Euphorbus.
16336,SECT. IX.,
16337,SECT. IX.,"And of the dead,"
16338,SECT. IX.,
16339,SECT. IX.,Isandros.
16340,SECT. IX.,Adrestus.
16341,SECT. IX.,
16342,SECT. IX.,"(2) Of the same metrical value with Augeias, Euphetes, Æneas,"
16343,SECT. IX.,Anchises:
16344,SECT. IX.,
16345,SECT. IX.,Antenor.
16346,SECT. IX.,Sarpedon.
16347,SECT. IX.,Pyræchmes.
16348,SECT. IX.,Hercules (Heracles).
16349,SECT. IX.,Eurystheus.
16350,SECT. IX.,
16351,SECT. IX.,(3) Of the same metrical value with Agamemnon:
16352,SECT. IX.,
16353,SECT. IX.,Diomedes.
16354,SECT. IX.,Polypœtes.
16355,SECT. IX.,Megapenthes.
16356,SECT. IX.,Thrasymedes.
16357,SECT. IX.,Eteoneus.
16358,SECT. IX.,Agapenor.
16359,SECT. IX.,Euphenor.
16360,SECT. IX.,Prothoenor.
16361,SECT. IX.,Hyperenor.
16362,SECT. IX.,
16363,SECT. IX.,"(4) Of the same metrical value with Agamemnon, except having the last"
16364,SECT. IX.,syllable short:
16365,SECT. IX.,
16366,SECT. IX.,Menelaus.
16367,SECT. IX.,Echepolus.
16368,SECT. IX.,Melanippus.
16369,SECT. IX.,Polydorus.
16370,SECT. IX.,
16371,SECT. IX.,"And of the dead,"
16372,SECT. IX.,
16373,SECT. IX.,Rhadamanthus.
16374,SECT. IX.,Meleagros.
16375,SECT. IX.,
16376,SECT. IX.,Here are thirty-five names as susceptible of conjunction with the
16377,SECT. IX.,phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν as the six to which he attaches it. How comes it to
16378,SECT. IX.,"be attached, significant as it is _primâ facie_, to the six, and never"
16379,SECT. IX.,"to the thirty-five? Did it come and go by accident, or had Homer a"
16380,SECT. IX.,meaning in it?
16381,SECT. IX.,
16382,SECT. IX.,"Moreover, I would by no means be understood to admit, that metrical"
16383,SECT. IX.,obstacles would have sufficed to prevent Homer from applying almost any
16384,SECT. IX.,title to almost any name: such were the resources of his genius and his
16385,SECT. IX.,"ear, and such the freedom that the youthful elasticity of the language"
16386,SECT. IX.,secured to him.
16387,SECT. IX.,
16388,SECT. IX.,It must be remembered too that he has given us an instance (in Il.
16389,SECT. IX.,"i. 7) of a second site, so to speak, for ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν in the Greek"
16390,SECT. IX.,"hexameter, which would have enabled him at once to combine it with all"
16391,SECT. IX.,"such proper names as come within the compass of a dactyl and trochee,"
16392,SECT. IX.,or a spondee and trochee. Such as Πουλυδάμας γὰρ ... Καὶ Πρίαμος μὲν
16393,SECT. IX.,... Καὶ γὰρ Τευκρὸς ... Θησεὺς αὐτὸς ... Δάρδανος αὐτὸς .... And even
16394,SECT. IX.,"without altering its usual position in the verse, by a break of it, or"
16395,SECT. IX.,"a _cæsura_, which is not unfrequent with him, he might have given us"
16396,SECT. IX.,"(for example) ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν γὰρ Ἐρεχθεύς. Or he might by _tmesis_, more"
16397,SECT. IX.,"liberally used, have further widened the field for its employment."
16398,SECT. IX.,
16399,SECT. IX.,"Or again, he would have been free, by the rules of his own usage, to"
16400,SECT. IX.,"have said in the vocative, ἀνδρῶν ἄνα."
16401,SECT. IX.,
16402,SECT. IX.,_Homer’s reverence for this title._
16403,SECT. IX.,
16404,SECT. IX.,"His abstinence from inflexion absolutely, and from _tmesis_ almost"
16405,SECT. IX.,"entirely, in the use of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, I think deserves remark. We might"
16406,SECT. IX.,"be struck, even in another author, by finding a word fifty-six times"
16407,SECT. IX.,"in the nominative singular, and never in any other form: but in Homer"
16408,SECT. IX.,"these slight circumstances have a value and significance, which in"
16409,SECT. IX.,ordinary cases it would be more dangerous to assign to them. It seems
16410,SECT. IX.,"to me possible, that this restraint in the use of the name, which"
16411,SECT. IX.,"always assigns to it the most commanding place in the sentence, was"
16412,SECT. IX.,not unconnected with a sense of reverence towards it. I think that if
16413,SECT. IX.,"we were to examine the correspondence, for example, between British"
16414,SECT. IX.,"Ministers and their Sovereign, we might find that the phrase ‘Your"
16415,SECT. IX.,"Majesty’ was placed, under a sort of natural and unconscious bias,"
16416,SECT. IX.,"by the writers, in the nominative case, in a proportional number of"
16417,SECT. IX.,instances far exceeding that which the pronoun ‘you’ would supply in an
16418,SECT. IX.,ordinary letter.
16419,SECT. IX.,
16420,SECT. IX.,It is difficult to define this delicate and subtle sentiment: but it
16421,SECT. IX.,may perhaps be illustrated by the feeling on which is founded the
16422,SECT. IX.,"prevailing usage of addressing among ourselves the very highest ranks,"
16423,SECT. IX.,"and in some languages all persons of consideration, in the third"
16424,SECT. IX.,"rather than the second person. And again, it is the same description"
16425,SECT. IX.,"of sentiment, which, when carried into the sphere of religion, has led"
16426,SECT. IX.,"Dante invariably to forbear, when he introduces the name ‘Cristo’ at"
16427,SECT. IX.,"the close of a verse, from placing any other word in rhyme with it, so"
16428,SECT. IX.,"that he makes it its own echo (so to speak), and repeats it thrice, in"
16429,SECT. IX.,"no less than four passages, to meet the full demand of his metre[784]."
16430,SECT. IX.,
16431,SECT. IX.,"Or again, as Homer appears to have possessed a fineness of ear which"
16432,SECT. IX.,"is not only wonderful, but by us in some part inappreciable, it may be"
16433,SECT. IX.,"that he attached an importance, which we cannot measure, to preserving"
16434,SECT. IX.,"a perfect uniformity in this dignified and sonorous title, as a means"
16435,SECT. IX.,"of producing popular impression, not less than of satisfying his own"
16436,SECT. IX.,taste.
16437,SECT. IX.,
16438,SECT. IX.,"Other instances might be given from Homer, bearing upon the case."
16439,SECT. IX.,
16440,SECT. IX.,"Ἐνοσίχθων is used forty times, and only once out of the nominative,"
16441,SECT. IX.,though metrical reasons could not hamper the poet with respect to any
16442,SECT. IX.,of the cases of this noun. Διογενὴς is used in the nominative and
16443,SECT. IX.,"vocative only. Κύδιστος is used sixteen times, and in the vocative"
16444,SECT. IX.,"alone. The feminine form however is found in the nominative, but only"
16445,SECT. IX.,in two passages (one of them with a rival reading) applied to Minerva.
16446,SECT. IX.,"Εὐρυκρείων is found twelve times, and only in the nominative."
16447,SECT. IX.,
16448,SECT. IX.,Perhaps again the rarity and slightness of his use of _tmesis_ may be
16449,SECT. IX.,"accounted for, not by euphony alone, but by the circumstance that these"
16450,SECT. IX.,two words had grown by titular use almost into one.
16451,SECT. IX.,
16452,SECT. IX.,The fact that the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν should have disappeared with
16453,SECT. IX.,"Homer himself, while his heroes were incessantly sung by later poets,"
16454,SECT. IX.,of itself raises a presumption that it belonged to a state of things
16455,SECT. IX.,"which, when after a wide interval the race of his successors began, had"
16456,SECT. IX.,wholly ceased to exist.
16457,SECT. IX.,
16458,SECT. IX.,"That stage of society, in the closing stages of which Homer lived,"
16459,SECT. IX.,"and which we know through him alone of classical authors, was the"
16460,SECT. IX.,patriarchal stage in its last phasis. By the patriarchal stage of
16461,SECT. IX.,"society, I mean the stage in which rights on the one hand, and powers"
16462,SECT. IX.,"and duties on the other, were still indeterminate, and were gradually"
16463,SECT. IX.,"passing from the state of _nebula_ into that of body. Now, if the"
16464,SECT. IX.,"phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν belonged to it, without doubt it must at the outset"
16465,SECT. IX.,"have exhibited its unvarying characteristic, the union of sovereign"
16466,SECT. IX.,"political power not only with hereditary descent, but with a reference"
16467,SECT. IX.,"to some original stock as an object of deep veneration, if not to a"
16468,SECT. IX.,relationship of blood more or less remote between the royal family and
16469,SECT. IX.,"their subjects, or to the dominant race among them."
16470,SECT. IX.,
16471,SECT. IX.,_Its relation to Patriarchal Chieftaincy._
16472,SECT. IX.,
16473,SECT. IX.,"The chieftaincies of the Celtic tribes in our own island, such as"
16474,SECT. IX.,"they existed until within only one century back, afford us a partial"
16475,SECT. IX.,analogy. The primary idea is that of the headship of an extended
16476,SECT. IX.,"family, sometimes approximating to the character of a nation;"
16477,SECT. IX.,"sometimes more limited, so that many of such families or tribes may be"
16478,SECT. IX.,regarded as belonging to the same nation. One marked characteristic
16479,SECT. IX.,"of these chieftaincies is that the preeminence and power, which"
16480,SECT. IX.,"they attached to birth, is separable from, though capable of union"
16481,SECT. IX.,"with, sovereignty strictly so called, that is, an absolute political"
16482,SECT. IX.,"supremacy, and subsists in its main particulars even after the"
16483,SECT. IX.,"division; neither does it become ambiguous or indefinite, where the"
16484,SECT. IX.,field for its exercise is a narrow one. The splendour of the name
16485,SECT. IX.,"increases with the range of dominion, but its integrity subsists even"
16486,SECT. IX.,"in the most contracted sphere, so long as the organization on which it"
16487,SECT. IX.,is dependent remains.
16488,SECT. IX.,
16489,SECT. IX.,"It is at least conceivable, that the Greek and the Celtic chieftaincies"
16490,SECT. IX.,"thus far agree. They differ in this, that the Hellenes, whenever we"
16491,SECT. IX.,"hear of them, appear more or less clearly as the subjugators of some"
16492,SECT. IX.,"race in prior occupancy of the soil, and as the masters of slaves: so"
16493,SECT. IX.,"that, while the relation of the Highland Chief to his clan was elevated"
16494,SECT. IX.,"and softened by union in blood, a Greek chieftaincy rather affected the"
16495,SECT. IX.,"relation between the head of the tribe and, not the whole, but only a"
16496,SECT. IX.,"privileged part, of the community."
16497,SECT. IX.,
16498,SECT. IX.,The fundamental idea of this chieftainship would lie in the
16499,SECT. IX.,"possession of the powers of government, patriarchally organized, by"
16500,SECT. IX.,"lineal descent, and traced up to the point which was the recognised"
16501,SECT. IX.,fountain-head of the traditions of the race.
16502,SECT. IX.,
16503,SECT. IX.,"Where the idea of succession by primogeniture was well defined, there"
16504,SECT. IX.,probably would be but one line in existence at a time that could hold
16505,SECT. IX.,the title for any one race. But there might be cases where the rule of
16506,SECT. IX.,"primogeniture was unknown, or not consistently applied, or where the"
16507,SECT. IX.,"fact of elder descent was contested, or where common descent from some"
16508,SECT. IX.,one acknowledged race and period might confer the title on a variety of
16509,SECT. IX.,"families, situated at remote points from one another, in each of which"
16510,SECT. IX.,it might afterwards be confined to the lineal heir. In such cases there
16511,SECT. IX.,"would be a plurality of lines, all running up into the stem of a common"
16512,SECT. IX.,"ancestor, and all bearing in their own separate successions the title"
16513,SECT. IX.,of chieftainships.
16514,SECT. IX.,
16515,SECT. IX.,"Again, among these chieftains one might be politically supreme over the"
16516,SECT. IX.,"rest within a given country. Such were the Macdonalds, Lords of the"
16517,SECT. IX.,"Isles, in Scotland, who claimed to be kings as well as chieftains: and"
16518,SECT. IX.,"such in Ireland were the Kevanaghs, O’Ruarcs, and O’Briens."
16519,SECT. IX.,
16520,SECT. IX.,If therefore I am right in interpreting the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν to
16521,SECT. IX.,"mean properly (together with something more) _Chieftain_, in a sense"
16522,SECT. IX.,"including the main elements of Celtic chieftaincy, or _Patriarch_, (but"
16523,SECT. IX.,the latter phrase is less applicable from its conventional connection
16524,SECT. IX.,"with advanced age), then it need excite no surprise if we find an ἄναξ"
16525,SECT. IX.,"ἀνδρῶν on each side, and not in the supreme command. At the same time,"
16526,SECT. IX.,though there are vast differences in power between one Homeric ἄναξ
16527,SECT. IX.,"ἀνδρῶν and another, they are all, so far as we see, strictly in the"
16528,SECT. IX.,"position of princes ordinarily independent within their dominions,"
16529,SECT. IX.,"though owning, it might be, the prerogatives of a qualified political"
16530,SECT. IX.,supremacy lodged in other hands.

16535,SECT. IX.,_Mode of its use for Agamemnon._
16536,SECT. IX.,
16537,SECT. IX.,"It is very worthy of remark, that Homer scarcely ever describes"
16538,SECT. IX.,Agamemnon by personal epithets. In a few passages (I see seven noticed)
16539,SECT. IX.,he uses the word δῖος in connection with the name: but this is one of
16540,SECT. IX.,"the least specific among the Homeric epithets for individuals, and is"
16541,SECT. IX.,"employed not only for Achilles, Hector, Ulysses, Nestor, and others,"
16542,SECT. IX.,"but for a crowd of inferior personages, so that, as a word of the most"
16543,SECT. IX.,"general purport, it has little or no defining or individualizing power."
16544,SECT. IX.,"It means preeminence in some particular kind, among a class, and it"
16545,SECT. IX.,"is applicable to any class; to Agamemnon greatest among sovereigns,"
16546,SECT. IX.,and to Eumæus worthiest among swineherds. A few times Homer calls
16547,SECT. IX.,"him ἥρως, a word which he also applies to the entire Greek army (Il."
16548,SECT. IX.,"ii. 110). In all other places, (I omit, of course, the invectives of"
16549,SECT. IX.,"Achilles,) he is characterised only by words taken from his position or"
16550,SECT. IX.,"descent. The principal of these are Ἀτρείδης, which he enjoys in common"
16551,SECT. IX.,"with Menelaus: κρείων, applied to him and to various other chiefs:"
16552,SECT. IX.,"ποιμὴν λαῶν, yet more largely and loosely used: εὐρυκρείων, which is"
16553,SECT. IX.,"exclusively his own among men, and which is the epithet used by Homer"
16554,SECT. IX.,as properly descriptive of his wide-reaching sway. It is also applied
16555,SECT. IX.,"to Neptune among the immortals, because vastness was with Homer a"
16556,SECT. IX.,"principal feature of the θάλασσα, his domain. Lastly, Agamemnon is ἄναξ"
16557,SECT. IX.,"ἀνδρῶν, which, as I hold, describes his position by birth as the head"
16558,SECT. IX.,or chieftain of the Achæans properly so called.
16559,SECT. IX.,
16560,SECT. IX.,"There are two remarkable passages, which are evidently intended to"
16561,SECT. IX.,"supply the key-note, as it were, for our conception of the material"
16562,SECT. IX.,"power of Agamemnon: the first, Il. ii. 108, respecting the sceptre:"
16563,SECT. IX.,"the second, in the Catalogue, Il. ii. 576-80: in both of these he is"
16564,SECT. IX.,"called κρείων, in neither ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. This fact entirely accords with"
16565,SECT. IX.,"the supposition that neither a determinate form of political power, nor"
16566,SECT. IX.,"military command, is the vital idea of the phrase."
16567,SECT. IX.,
16568,SECT. IX.,"On the other hand, although the Poet does not seem to connect this"
16569,SECT. IX.,"phrase with imperial power, yet that he intended to use it as one"
16570,SECT. IX.,"highly characteristic, we may at once deem probable from his having"
16571,SECT. IX.,"employed it in that remarkable passage[785] with which the poem begins,"
16572,SECT. IX.,"and which so succinctly, yet so broadly opens the subject of it."
16573,SECT. IX.,"For here he has taken the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν out of its usual, and"
16574,SECT. IX.,"elsewhere its only place in the verse, and has subjoined it, contrary"
16575,SECT. IX.,"in this likewise to his uniform practice elsewhere, to the name of the"
16576,SECT. IX.,person described by it. The line is
16577,SECT. IX.,
16578,SECT. IX.,"Ἀτρείδης τε, ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, καὶ δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς."
16579,SECT. IX.,
16580,SECT. IX.,Evidently this is done for greater emphasis: as ‘great Alexander’
16581,SECT. IX.,"is less emphatic than ‘Alexander the Great,’ and ‘king Darius’ than"
16582,SECT. IX.,"‘Darius the king.’ It may be admitted that the epithet δῖος, used in"
16583,SECT. IX.,"this place for Achilles, is not one of the most characteristic: but"
16584,SECT. IX.,Achilles had already been described (in v. i.) by that distinguished
16585,SECT. IX.,"patronymic which formed his chief glory[786], as it connected him,"
16586,SECT. IX.,"through his father and his grandfather, with Jupiter."
16587,SECT. IX.,
16588,SECT. IX.,All these presumptions drawn from the case of Agamemnon converge upon
16589,SECT. IX.,"a point: they tend to show, that ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν means preeminence indeed,"
16590,SECT. IX.,"but yet a particular kind of preeminence; and one distinct from, and"
16591,SECT. IX.,"more specific than, the general idea of sovereignty."
16592,SECT. IX.,
16593,SECT. IX.,_Extraction and station of Agamemnon._
16594,SECT. IX.,
16595,SECT. IX.,The so-called genealogy of Agamemnon differs from every other one given
16596,SECT. IX.,"by Homer in this, that it does not describe the descent in a right"
16597,SECT. IX.,"line. For as Thyestes, one of his three predecessors on the Pelopid"
16598,SECT. IX.,"throne was the father of Ægisthus, who was the contemporary, but yet"
16599,SECT. IX.,"not the brother of Agamemnon, he must without doubt have been brother"
16600,SECT. IX.,"to Atreus, Agamemnon’s father. It is in fact not a genealogy simply,"
16601,SECT. IX.,but rather a succession in dignities. The dignity of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν may
16602,SECT. IX.,have combined with that of the political supremacy to lead Homer into
16603,SECT. IX.,"this unusual course. If, as I suppose, ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν required the double"
16604,SECT. IX.,"derivation both of lineage and of sovereignty, this was the way, and"
16605,SECT. IX.,"the only way, in which Homer could attain his end. And his having"
16606,SECT. IX.,pursued this method seems to imply that such _was_ his end.
16607,SECT. IX.,
16608,SECT. IX.,"I cannot therefore under the conditions of the definition given above,"
16609,SECT. IX.,explain the application of the phrase to Agamemnon by mere reference
16610,SECT. IX.,"to his political supremacy. It will be necessary to prove, either by"
16611,SECT. IX.,"direct or by presumptive evidence, his lineal connection with the"
16612,SECT. IX.,"primitive Grecian or Hellenic stock, the trunk of the tree from which"
16613,SECT. IX.,other Achæan families were branches and offshoots only.
16614,SECT. IX.,
16615,SECT. IX.,"I propose to do this by showing,"
16616,SECT. IX.,
16617,SECT. IX.,"First, that no appreciable value is to be attached to the notions which"
16618,SECT. IX.,represent him as the grandson of an Asiatic immigrant; while even if
16619,SECT. IX.,"this descent could be made good, we should not on that account be"
16620,SECT. IX.,justified in at once proceeding to deny that the Pelopids were of pure
16621,SECT. IX.,Hellenic blood.
16622,SECT. IX.,
16623,SECT. IX.,"Secondly, that he was not merely at the moment the political head of"
16624,SECT. IX.,"Greece, but that he was also the hereditary chief of the Achæans, then"
16625,SECT. IX.,the ruling tribe of the country.
16626,SECT. IX.,
16627,SECT. IX.,"Thirdly, that this Achæan tribe was in all likelihood derived from"
16628,SECT. IX.,"Thessaly, where it was especially rooted and distinguished: as Thessaly"
16629,SECT. IX.,"was itself fed from the Helli of the mountains, and constituted"
16630,SECT. IX.,the secondary and immediate source from whence the Hellenic races
16631,SECT. IX.,"successively issued, and spread themselves over the peninsula."
16632,SECT. IX.,
16633,SECT. IX.,I do not pretend to carry the proof of a patriarchal position or lineal
16634,SECT. IX.,chieftaincy in the case of Agamemnon further. We do not know what was
16635,SECT. IX.,the strictly original royal stock of the Hellenic tribes. The current
16636,SECT. IX.,"tradition of Hellen and his sons would be very convenient, but it is"
16637,SECT. IX.,"too obviously accommodated to after-times, and too flatly at variance"
16638,SECT. IX.,"with the earliest, that is to say with the Homeric accounts, to be in"
16639,SECT. IX.,the slightest degree trustworthy as an historic basis. We may take
16640,SECT. IX.,the Hesiodic tradition as affording evidence of the belief that there
16641,SECT. IX.,"was a primitive royal stock, and that the ruling families had been"
16642,SECT. IX.,"derived from it, since within these limits it does not contradict"
16643,SECT. IX.,Homer; but we can justly build upon it nothing further. Undoubtedly
16644,SECT. IX.,"the very employment of the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, if the proposed"
16645,SECT. IX.,"construction of it can be made good, will greatly fortify this belief."
16646,SECT. IX.,But this can only be made good in a presumptive manner: as by showing
16647,SECT. IX.,that the phrase was only given in ruling families: and only in the
16648,SECT. IX.,representative lines of ruling families: and only in families which
16649,SECT. IX.,ruled over tribes of the dominant race; and which had so ruled from
16650,SECT. IX.,"time immemorial--that is to say, they must be families of which it"
16651,SECT. IX.,cannot be shown that at any time they had acquired their position in
16652,SECT. IX.,"their own tribe. If a first ancestor, apparently the channel of the"
16653,SECT. IX.,"title, is indicated, he must be one from whom history begins: there"
16654,SECT. IX.,"must be nothing before him, nothing to show that he or his line had"
16655,SECT. IX.,"ever been less than what he came to be. Lastly, the tribes, over which"
16656,SECT. IX.,"the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν rules, must be in visible or presumable connection"
16657,SECT. IX.,locally with the original seat or cradle of the nation; and it will
16658,SECT. IX.,"be a further confirmation of the argument if, as we ascend the"
16659,SECT. IX.,"lineal lines, we find in them a tendency to converge towards an unity"
16660,SECT. IX.,"of origin, which we shall find poetically expressed as the divine"
16661,SECT. IX.,"parentage of Jupiter, and thus covered with the golden clouds of a"
16662,SECT. IX.,"remote antiquity, that not even the sun can pierce[787]. Perhaps we may"
16663,SECT. IX.,even find reason to suppose it likely that descent from Jupiter was an
16664,SECT. IX.,essential qualification for the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.
16665,SECT. IX.,
16666,SECT. IX.,_Arguments against his Hellenic descent._
16667,SECT. IX.,
16668,SECT. IX.,"First, then, let us deal with the negative or adverse presumptions,"
16669,SECT. IX.,which would go to prove that Agamemnon was not Hellenic at all.
16670,SECT. IX.,
16671,SECT. IX.,"It may be urged,"
16672,SECT. IX.,
16673,SECT. IX.,"1. That we see, even from Homer, that Pelops was a recent hero, only"
16674,SECT. IX.,"two generations before the _Troica_, so that Agamemnon has no antiquity"
16675,SECT. IX.,to boast of.
16676,SECT. IX.,
16677,SECT. IX.,"2. That, according to extraneous tradition, there is no connection"
16678,SECT. IX.,between Agamemnon and the Hellic stock: as Pelops is reputed to be the
16679,SECT. IX.,"son of Tantalus, and Tantalus the king of Phrygia."
16680,SECT. IX.,
16681,SECT. IX.,"To the first I answer, that the list of names in Il. ii. 101-8, is not"
16682,SECT. IX.,"simply a genealogy, for it includes Thyestes, who is not in the right"
16683,SECT. IX.,"line; but it is a succession of kings on a common throne, and can only"
16684,SECT. IX.,"therefore begin with Pelops, as the first who sat upon that throne."
16685,SECT. IX.,
16686,SECT. IX.,"But, further, even if it were a genealogy, yet Homer seems usually to"
16687,SECT. IX.,"begin his genealogies not with the first known ancestor of a person,"
16688,SECT. IX.,but with the first ancestor of his who settled in the place where he
16689,SECT. IX.,"exercises power. Thus Nestor, though we acquire indirectly a knowledge"
16690,SECT. IX.,"of his earlier descent through the Νεκυΐα, has no genealogy beyond"
16691,SECT. IX.,"Neleus his father, because he was the ancestor that migrated into"
16692,SECT. IX.,"Peloponnesus, or, at least, that first acquired the Pylian throne, by"
16693,SECT. IX.,"marriage into a prior, and perhaps a Pelasgian house[788]. Ulysses"
16694,SECT. IX.,"has none beyond Arceisius; and it is plain, from the records of the"
16695,SECT. IX.,"earlier dynasty in Ithaca, that there could have been no king of that"
16696,SECT. IX.,"house before him. Dardanus and Minos, heads of genealogies, were also"
16697,SECT. IX.,"the founders of sovereignties. Again, Portheus is given us as the head"
16698,SECT. IX.,of the Œneid line in Ætolia: and we have found it probable that he was
16699,SECT. IX.,the first of his race[789] who migrated into that country. The same
16700,SECT. IX.,"considerations, in all likelihood, hold good with regard to Pelops."
16701,SECT. IX.,
16702,SECT. IX.,Now with respect to the second objection.
16703,SECT. IX.,
16704,SECT. IX.,We are to remember that Homer has nowhere asserted the connection
16705,SECT. IX.,"between Pelops and Tantalus, or between Tantalus and Phrygia."
16706,SECT. IX.,
16707,SECT. IX.,"But not even the latter connection, and far less the former, would"
16708,SECT. IX.,disprove the title of Agamemnon to represent lineally the character of
16709,SECT. IX.,"ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. For, as we have seen, that title subsisted in the line of"
16710,SECT. IX.,"Dardanus, and the causes which planted it there might also have planted"
16711,SECT. IX.,it in Phrygia; which is not irrationally supposed to have been the line
16712,SECT. IX.,of march for the Hellic race in its original movement westwards[790].
16713,SECT. IX.,"Moreover, Phrygia is not a name confined to Asia."
16714,SECT. IX.,
16715,SECT. IX.,_Connection of Tantalus with the Greeks._
16716,SECT. IX.,
16717,SECT. IX.,"There are, however, many indirect Homeric indications, as well as"
16718,SECT. IX.,"much extra-Homeric tradition, which tend to connect Pelops both with"
16719,SECT. IX.,Tantalus and with Greece.
16720,SECT. IX.,
16721,SECT. IX.,"First, even if Tantalus were known to Homer as the father of Pelops, he"
16722,SECT. IX.,"could not have been named in the tradition of Il. ii. 101-8, unless he"
16723,SECT. IX.,"had occupied, like Pelops, the throne to which Agamemnon succeeded."
16724,SECT. IX.,
16725,SECT. IX.,"From the appearance of Tantalus in the Νεκυΐα, it is probable that"
16726,SECT. IX.,"Homer regarded him as Greek, either by birth or by what we may call"
16727,SECT. IX.,"naturalization. This he might be in the Poet’s view, if the traditions"
16728,SECT. IX.,"concerning him, without assigning to him Greek birth or even residence,"
16729,SECT. IX.,"made him the father of one who became a great Greek sovereign. If,"
16730,SECT. IX.,"for instance, we take the name of Æolus; it is the source of some of"
16731,SECT. IX.,"the most famous Greek houses, yet Homer never mentions it, except in"
16732,SECT. IX.,"the patronymic, and gives us no means of absolutely attaching it to"
16733,SECT. IX.,any part of Greece. Æolus may have been known only as the father of
16734,SECT. IX.,"Greeks. So Minos was not of Greek birth; but was naturalized, and"
16735,SECT. IX.,therefore appears in the Νεκυΐα as the judge of the nether world. All
16736,SECT. IX.,"the other personages, without exception, who are introduced there, are"
16737,SECT. IX.,"apparently Greek: Sisyphus, Hercules, Tityus, Theseus, Pirithous, from"
16738,SECT. IX.,"clear marks of residence: even Orion, since he is made the hero of a"
16739,SECT. IX.,"scene in Delos[791], appears, whatever his origin, to have been already"
16740,SECT. IX.,Hellenized by tradition. Nor is it easy to avoid the same assumption
16741,SECT. IX.,with respect to Tantalus.
16742,SECT. IX.,
16743,SECT. IX.,"Again, we may be quite sure, that Tantalus was a person of the highest"
16744,SECT. IX.,rank and position. None others seem to have been distinguished by an
16745,SECT. IX.,express notice of their fate after death. Orion was the object of the
16746,SECT. IX.,"passion of Aurora (Od. v. 121). Tityus was an offender so lofty, that"
16747,SECT. IX.,he became the occasion of a voyage of Rhadamanthus himself to deal with
16748,SECT. IX.,"his crime[792]. Sisyphus was, as we have found reason to believe[793],"
16749,SECT. IX.,of the most exalted stock.
16750,SECT. IX.,
16751,SECT. IX.,"The punishment of Tantalus in the nether world is probably, as in"
16752,SECT. IX.,"other cases, the reflection of a previous catastrophe, certainly of"
16753,SECT. IX.,"a previous character, upon earth. The nature of his punishment is a"
16754,SECT. IX.,"perpetual temptation, of irresistible force, presented to the appetites"
16755,SECT. IX.,"of hunger and thirst, while the gratification of it is wholly and"
16756,SECT. IX.,perpetually denied. This shews that his offence on earth must have been
16757,SECT. IX.,"some form of πλεονεξία, of greediness, presumption, or ambition. It is"
16758,SECT. IX.,"therefore not unlikely that by restless attempts at acquisition, he may"
16759,SECT. IX.,"have convulsed his dominions, and caused his son to migrate."
16760,SECT. IX.,
16761,SECT. IX.,Now this supposed vein of character in Tantalus would thoroughly accord
16762,SECT. IX.,with that of the Pelopid line. He is punished for covetousness or
16763,SECT. IX.,"acquisitiveness. His son gains a kingdom through Mercury, who is the"
16764,SECT. IX.,god of increase by fair means or foul. His grandson Thyestes gathers
16765,SECT. IX.,"wealth (πολύαρς, Il. ii. 106): his great-grandson Agamemnon is deeply"
16766,SECT. IX.,marked by the avarice everywhere glanced at in the Iliad: and finally
16767,SECT. IX.,we have the reckless and guilty cravings of the ambition of Ægisthus.
16768,SECT. IX.,
16769,SECT. IX.,"We are by no means without reasons from the poems for placing Tantalus,"
16770,SECT. IX.,"as the later tradition places him, among the heroes of the stock"
16771,SECT. IX.,of Jupiter. One ground is afforded us by the text of the Eleventh
16772,SECT. IX.,"Odyssey for supposing that he was, I do not say a son, but at least a"
16773,SECT. IX.,"descendant of Jupiter. It is this; that apparently all the heroes, to"
16774,SECT. IX.,"whom we are thus introduced, were at least of divine extraction. They"
16775,SECT. IX.,"are, besides Tantalus, as follows:--"
16776,SECT. IX.,
16777,SECT. IX.,"1. Minos, who was a son of Jupiter. (Od. xi. 568.)"
16778,SECT. IX.,
16779,SECT. IX.,2. Orion: he was of divine extraction according to the later tradition.
16780,SECT. IX.,"In Homer he has no parentage, but he had at least attained to divine"
16781,SECT. IX.,"honours, inasmuch as he was translated into a star. (Od. v. 274 et"
16782,SECT. IX.,alibi.)
16783,SECT. IX.,
16784,SECT. IX.,"3. Tityus, son of Γαῖα. (Od. xi. 596, and vii. 324.)"
16785,SECT. IX.,
16786,SECT. IX.,"4. Sisyphus, son of Æolus; therefore descended from Jupiter."
16787,SECT. IX.,
16788,SECT. IX.,"5. Hercules, son of Jupiter (ibid. 620.)"
16789,SECT. IX.,
16790,SECT. IX.,"But I rely specially upon the passages towards the end, where these"
16791,SECT. IX.,"are all called ἄνδρες ἥρωες, and where Ulysses says he might have seen"
16792,SECT. IX.,"others, namely, Θήσεα Πειρίθοόν τε, θεῶν ἐρικύδεα τέκνα, illustrious"
16793,SECT. IX.,children of the gods: as if to be a child of the gods were a condition
16794,SECT. IX.,"of appearing in this august, though mournful, company."
16795,SECT. IX.,
16796,SECT. IX.,"Hereas, a Megarian author of uncertain age, is quoted by Plutarch[794]"
16797,SECT. IX.,as having declared that the last cited verse was among the
16798,SECT. IX.,interpolations of Pisistratus. But Hereas was as likely to be wrong
16799,SECT. IX.,"in this statement, through Megarian antipathy, as Pisistratus to have"
16800,SECT. IX.,interpolated the verse in favour of Athenian vanity. The internal
16801,SECT. IX.,"evidence is, I think, in its favour. For the phrase θεῶν ἐρικύδεα τέκνα"
16802,SECT. IX.,"is, according to the view here given, really characteristic. It is,"
16803,SECT. IX.,"at the same time, characteristic through the medium of an idea which,"
16804,SECT. IX.,"though it can be deduced fairly from the text, is not obvious upon"
16805,SECT. IX.,its surface; namely the idea that all the heroes of the Νεκυΐα were
16806,SECT. IX.,divine. The verse is therefore supported by something in the nature of
16807,SECT. IX.,a spontaneous or undesigned coincidence.
16808,SECT. IX.,
16809,SECT. IX.,The post-Homeric tradition makes Niobe the daughter of Tantalus;
16810,SECT. IX.,"and, if this be so, then we may derive from her very high position a"
16811,SECT. IX.,further support to the presumption that Tantalus was of the race of
16812,SECT. IX.,"Jupiter, as also to the hypothesis of his personal connection with"
16813,SECT. IX.,"Greece. For that the tradition of Niobe is Greek we see, from its being"
16814,SECT. IX.,cited by Achilles; and that she was a sovereign is clearly implied
16815,SECT. IX.,by the combined effect of various circumstances. The first is her
16816,SECT. IX.,"being compared by Achilles with Priam. The second, that the vaunt"
16817,SECT. IX.,of an inferior person would hardly have been noticed by the direct
16818,SECT. IX.,intervention of the gods. The third is the singular extent and dignity
16819,SECT. IX.,"of that intervention: Apollo slays the sons, Diana the daughters;"
16820,SECT. IX.,Jupiter converts the people to stone; the Immortals at large bury the
16821,SECT. IX.,"dead. The fourth is the use of the term λαοὺς, which means plainly the"
16822,SECT. IX.,subjects of the kingdom where Niobe was queen.
16823,SECT. IX.,
16824,SECT. IX.,We cannot now carry farther the presumptions that Tantalus was
16825,SECT. IX.,"the descendant of Jupiter, and Agamemnon of Tantalus: but if, in"
16826,SECT. IX.,"considering the cases of the other members of his class, we shall"
16827,SECT. IX.,sufficiently shew that they were all descended in common repute from
16828,SECT. IX.,"Jupiter, we shall then perhaps be warranted in relying more decidedly"
16829,SECT. IX.,"upon the connection, which is suggested by the text in the case of"
16830,SECT. IX.,Agamemnon through his presumed ancestor Tantalus.
16831,SECT. IX.,
16832,SECT. IX.,It is difficult to find more than slight traces of the seat of the
16833,SECT. IX.,power of Tantalus from Homer.
16834,SECT. IX.,
16835,SECT. IX.,"He mentions a mountain called Sipylus[795], near the Achelous, and"
16836,SECT. IX.,thus near the principal passage from Northern and Middle into Southern
16837,SECT. IX.,Greece. Here it is that he places the mourning Niobe. But Pausanias
16838,SECT. IX.,"places the tomb of Pelops on the summit of Mount Sipylus, meaning,"
16839,SECT. IX.,"apparently, the hill of that name in Lydia[796]. Again, the Phryges,"
16840,SECT. IX.,"over whom the later tradition reports him to have reigned, are also"
16841,SECT. IX.,made known to us as a Thracian people[797]: a designation quite capable
16842,SECT. IX.,of embracing any of the hill tribes in the neighbourhood of Thessaly.
16843,SECT. IX.,We have another sign of the extension of this name in the Phrygians of
16844,SECT. IX.,"Attica, mentioned by Thucydides (ii. 22): and the Phrygian alphabet is"
16845,SECT. IX.,closely akin to that of Greece.
16846,SECT. IX.,
16847,SECT. IX.,"Strabo, however, observes, that the state of these traditions is"
16848,SECT. IX.,"so greatly confused, so as to make them scarcely tractable for the"
16849,SECT. IX.,purposes of history[798].
16850,SECT. IX.,
16851,SECT. IX.,_Place of Pelops in Greek history._
16852,SECT. IX.,
16853,SECT. IX.,The connection of Pelops with Southern Greece is well supported by
16854,SECT. IX.,the ancient name of Peloponnesus. No notice of this name is found in
16855,SECT. IX.,"Homer; but we need not be surprised, if Pelops was the first of his"
16856,SECT. IX.,"race in that part of the country, at finding him sparely recognised by"
16857,SECT. IX.,the Poet: it is the uniform manner of the poet with strangers or _novi
16858,SECT. IX.,homines_.
16859,SECT. IX.,
16860,SECT. IX.,The Homeric notices of Pelops are not more liberal than of Tantalus. 1.
16861,SECT. IX.,We find him called πλήξιππος[799] in such a way as shows that something
16862,SECT. IX.,connected with the driving of a chariot must have been attached either
16863,SECT. IX.,"to the known habits, or to some great crisis of his life, or to both."
16864,SECT. IX.,"In either mode, it agrees with the common tradition, according to"
16865,SECT. IX.,"which, by success in the chariot race, he won the hand of Hippodameia,"
16866,SECT. IX.,"daughter of king Œnomaus, and therewith the throne of Pisa. We have"
16867,SECT. IX.,"another fact from Homer which tends to support this tradition, namely,"
16868,SECT. IX.,"that in the earliest youth of Nestor there were, as we have seen,"
16869,SECT. IX.,"public games, which included chariot-races, in Elis."
16870,SECT. IX.,
16871,SECT. IX.,2. The common tradition is also further supported by the passage in the
16872,SECT. IX.,"Second Iliad, which gives us the line of Pelopid sovereigns. For we are"
16873,SECT. IX.,there told that Vulcan wrought the Pelopid sceptre for Jupiter: that
16874,SECT. IX.,"Jupiter gave it to Mercury, and Mercury to Pelops the horse-driver, who"
16875,SECT. IX.,handed it on to Atreus and the rest. From this statement two things
16876,SECT. IX.,"clearly appear. First, that the throne of Pelops was gained either by"
16877,SECT. IX.,"craft, or at least by enterprise, of his own. Secondly, that it was a"
16878,SECT. IX.,"new power which he erected, and that he was not merely the transferee"
16879,SECT. IX.,of the power of the Perseid line.
16880,SECT. IX.,
16881,SECT. IX.,Nor is it difficult to discern wherein the novelty consisted. This
16882,SECT. IX.,sceptre carried the right of paramount lordship over all Greece--
16883,SECT. IX.,
16884,SECT. IX.,πολλῇσιν νήσοισι καὶ Ἄργεϊ παντὶ ἀνάσσειν[800]--
16885,SECT. IX.,
16886,SECT. IX.,"whereas the Perseids had been local sovereigns, though probably the"
16887,SECT. IX.,first in rank and power among their contemporaries of Continental
16888,SECT. IX.,Greece.
16889,SECT. IX.,
16890,SECT. IX.,"Now this sovereignty, thus extended, was plainly an Achæan sovereignty."
16891,SECT. IX.,"For we have seen that, contemporaneously with its erection, Homer drops"
16892,SECT. IX.,the marked and exclusive use of the word Ἀργεῖοι for the inhabitants
16893,SECT. IX.,"of that quarter, and calls them by preference Ἀχαιοὶ, the older name"
16894,SECT. IX.,"falling into the shade. Thus, then, the Achæans rose with the house of"
16895,SECT. IX.,"Pelops: and this being the case, we can the better understand why it"
16896,SECT. IX.,was that that house rose to so great an elevation. It was because the
16897,SECT. IX.,Achæan race had now acquired extension in the North and in the South
16898,SECT. IX.,"of Greece, in Eastern and Western Peloponnesus, and because it usually"
16899,SECT. IX.,predominated wheresoever it went. Thus the house of Pelops had an
16900,SECT. IX.,"opportunity of gaining influence and power, which had not been enjoyed"
16901,SECT. IX.,"by the preceding dynasties, though they ruled from the same sovereign"
16902,SECT. IX.,seat. They were families only: the Pelopids were chiefs of a race.
16903,SECT. IX.,
16904,SECT. IX.,"What we have thus seen from Homer, with respect to the high position"
16905,SECT. IX.,"attained by Pelops, is confirmed by the later tradition."
16906,SECT. IX.,
16907,SECT. IX.,"Pausanias notices the local traces of Tantalus, as well as of Pelops,"
16908,SECT. IX.,in Elis. A harbour there bore the name of Tantalus[801]: and Pelops was
16909,SECT. IX.,worshipped in a sanctuary hard by the temple of Jupiter Olympius. It
16910,SECT. IX.,"was on the right hand, in front of that temple, a very marked situation"
16911,SECT. IX.,"in all likelihood: and Pausanias says, that the Elians reverenced"
16912,SECT. IX.,"Pelops among heroes, like Jupiter among gods. It was probably on this"
16913,SECT. IX.,"account, and as a memorial of the worship from high places, that the"
16914,SECT. IX.,"θρόνος, or seat of Pelops, was, as he says, not only in Sipylus, but on"
16915,SECT. IX.,the summit of the mountain.
16916,SECT. IX.,
16917,SECT. IX.,"Another tradition makes Pelops the original king of Pisa, the rival"
16918,SECT. IX.,"town to Elis, which at length succumbed to it. And a further tradition"
16919,SECT. IX.,"reports, that he became the son-in-law of Œnomaus, king of Pisa, by"
16920,SECT. IX.,"conquering him in the chariot-race: and together with this, that he"
16921,SECT. IX.,restored the Olympian Games. Another tradition reports him to have come
16922,SECT. IX.,"from Olenos in Achaia: and as the Dorians, with the Heraclids, came"
16923,SECT. IX.,"into Peloponnesus by that route, probably as the easiest, so, and for"
16924,SECT. IX.,"the same reason, may Pelops probably have done. Lastly, while Homer"
16925,SECT. IX.,"places Achæans in Ægina and in Mases, (of which the site is unknown,)"
16926,SECT. IX.,Pausanias (b. ii. c. 34) states that nine islands (νησίδες) off the
16927,SECT. IX.,"coast of Methana, which lies directly opposite Ægina, were in his time"
16928,SECT. IX.,called the Islands of Pelops.
16929,SECT. IX.,
16930,SECT. IX.,"Before quitting the subject of Pelops, I would observe, that his"
16931,SECT. IX.,worship in Olympia with such peculiar honours is connected with a
16932,SECT. IX.,"tradition, that he raised the Olympian Games to a distinction which"
16933,SECT. IX.,they had never before attained. Now if we view him as the principal
16934,SECT. IX.,"chief who brought the Achæans into Peloponnesus, this tradition tends"
16935,SECT. IX.,to support the view which has been taken in a former section of the
16936,SECT. IX.,relation between the Hellic race and the institution of public Games.
16937,SECT. IX.,"Nor is there any thing more intrinsically probable, than that a chief"
16938,SECT. IX.,from the great breeding region of Thessaly should have either founded
16939,SECT. IX.,"the chariot or horse-races of Olympia, or should have raised them to"
16940,SECT. IX.,"an unprecedented celebrity, and secured for them the truly national"
16941,SECT. IX.,position that they for so long a time maintained.
16942,SECT. IX.,
16943,SECT. IX.,"We have seen thus far,"
16944,SECT. IX.,
16945,SECT. IX.,1. That the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν is employed by Homer as the chief
16946,SECT. IX.,distinction of Agamemnon.
16947,SECT. IX.,
16948,SECT. IX.,"2. That most probably Agamemnon was descended from Tantalus, as well"
16949,SECT. IX.,"as from Pelops, that the line was a line of sovereigns all along, and"
16950,SECT. IX.,Tantalus in all likelihood a reputed descendant of Jupiter himself.
16951,SECT. IX.,
16952,SECT. IX.,"3. That the Achæans emerge in company with the Pelopids, from the"
16953,SECT. IX.,"cavern of pre-historic night, and that the Pelopids are therefore to"
16954,SECT. IX.,be taken as in all likelihood the chief and senior house of the Achæan
16955,SECT. IX.,tribe.
16956,SECT. IX.,
16957,SECT. IX.,"But we have still to ask, whence came the Achæans themselves? and how"
16958,SECT. IX.,are we to prove their connection with the Hellenic name and stock?
16959,SECT. IX.,
16960,SECT. IX.,"And first, as to Homeric evidence."
16961,SECT. IX.,
16962,SECT. IX.,_Achæans from Thessaly._
16963,SECT. IX.,
16964,SECT. IX.,"We have already seen, in considering Homer’s account of the contingent"
16965,SECT. IX.,"of Achilles, and also from Il. ix. 395, that the Achæan race appears"
16966,SECT. IX.,to have been the dominant one in the proper and original Hellas of
16967,SECT. IX.,"Thessaly: which appears to place it beyond doubt, that the Achæans were"
16968,SECT. IX.,they who first carried with them extensively into Greece the Hellenic
16969,SECT. IX.,"name, a name always following in the wake of the Achæan one, and in"
16970,SECT. IX.,"Homer extending to all Greece, unless we except that part which was the"
16971,SECT. IX.,sovereign seat of Achæan power.
16972,SECT. IX.,
16973,SECT. IX.,The first form of the name is with the Helli of Northern Thessaly:
16974,SECT. IX.,the second is developed into the Hellas proper of Southern Thessaly;
16975,SECT. IX.,we find the third in the more large and less determinate use of the
16976,SECT. IX.,word for Greece to the northward of the Isthmus. The name gains this
16977,SECT. IX.,extension apparently just during the period while the Achæans are
16978,SECT. IX.,"moving southward, as the house of Ulysses to Ithaca, the house of"
16979,SECT. IX.,"Neleus, perhaps with an Achæan train, to Pylos, the Pelopids to Mycenæ"
16980,SECT. IX.,"and Sparta, Tydeus from Ætolia to Argos."
16981,SECT. IX.,
16982,SECT. IX.,"And again, we must observe this distinction. We see the Achæans come"
16983,SECT. IX.,"into the Peloponnesus, and we can, from the text of Homer, point out"
16984,SECT. IX.,the time when they were not there. But we do not see them come into
16985,SECT. IX.,Thessaly from among the Helli of the mountains. We simply find their
16986,SECT. IX.,"name prominent there; from which we must conclude, that Homer meant to"
16987,SECT. IX.,point them out as the first representatives on an adequate scale of
16988,SECT. IX.,Hellas in that country.
16989,SECT. IX.,
16990,SECT. IX.,All this is strongly confirmed by the later tradition as to the
16991,SECT. IX.,"connection of Pelops with the Achæans of Thessaly, and by the clear"
16992,SECT. IX.,historical proofs in our possession of the profound root which the
16993,SECT. IX.,Achæan name had taken there.
16994,SECT. IX.,
16995,SECT. IX.,"Strabo, in a passage where he chooses a particular tradition from among"
16996,SECT. IX.,"many, as peculiarly worthy of record, says[802],"
16997,SECT. IX.,
16998,SECT. IX.,Ἀχαιοὺς γὰρ τοὺς Φθιώτας φασὶ συγκατελθόντας Πέλοπι εἰς τὴν
16999,SECT. IX.,"Πελοπόννησον, οἰκῆσαι τὴν Λακωνικὴν· τοσοῦτον δ’ ἀρετῇ διενεγκεῖν, ὥστε"
17000,SECT. IX.,"τὴν Πελοπόννησον, ἐκ πολλῶν ἤδη χρόνων Ἄργος λεγομένην, τότε Ἀχαϊκὸν"
17001,SECT. IX.,Ἄργος λεχθῆναι.
17002,SECT. IX.,
17003,SECT. IX.,"Thus he at once asserts the connection of Pelops with the Achæans, and"
17004,SECT. IX.,"of the Achæans with Thessaly. He proceeds to say, that Laconia was"
17005,SECT. IX.,considered to have a peculiar title to the name of Achaic Argos[803];
17006,SECT. IX.,"that some construed Od. iii. 251 as supporting it, and that the"
17007,SECT. IX.,"Achæans, driven by the Dorians out of Laconia, in their turn displaced"
17008,SECT. IX.,"an Ionian race from Achaia, and took possession of the district."
17009,SECT. IX.,
17010,SECT. IX.,"Herodotus[804], in treating of the Peloponnesus, describes the"
17011,SECT. IX.,"Arcadians and Cynurians as αὐτόχθονες, who had never changed their"
17012,SECT. IX.,"habitation; four other races, including the Dorians, as ἐπήλυδες, and"
17013,SECT. IX.,"the Achæans as having migrated about the Peloponnesus, but never left"
17014,SECT. IX.,it. He does not explicitly place the Achæans in either class; and this
17015,SECT. IX.,"tradition does not throw much light on the origin of the Achæans, which"
17016,SECT. IX.,"would seem not to have been within his knowledge, but only deals with"
17017,SECT. IX.,matter subsequent to their entry into Peloponnesus.
17018,SECT. IX.,
17019,SECT. IX.,"Pausanias[805], again, would seem rather to draw the Thessalian Achæans"
17020,SECT. IX.,"from Peloponnesus than _vice versa_. He tells us that, after the death"
17021,SECT. IX.,"of Xuthus, Achæus went with an army from Ægialus, and established"
17022,SECT. IX.,"himself in Thessaly. But with Homer before us, we may boldly say,"
17023,SECT. IX.,that there was no such person as either the Xuthus or the Achæus of
17024,SECT. IX.,"the later tradition, and that there were, on the other hand, Achæans"
17025,SECT. IX.,"in Thessaly long before the time assigned to this Achæus, namely, the"
17026,SECT. IX.,"epoch when the race took refuge in Ægialus. This tradition, then, is"
17027,SECT. IX.,"late and worthless, and, even if it directly contradicted that of"
17028,SECT. IX.,"Strabo, which it does not, could not be put in competition with it."
17029,SECT. IX.,
17030,SECT. IX.,The tradition which made Phthiotis in Southern Thessaly the cradle of
17031,SECT. IX.,"the Achæan race, where it first grew into conscious life, seems to have"
17032,SECT. IX.,been an undying one.
17033,SECT. IX.,
17034,SECT. IX.,_Duration of the name in Thessaly._
17035,SECT. IX.,
17036,SECT. IX.,Here again history comes in to our aid. Throughout the historic
17037,SECT. IX.,"times of Greece, and down to the era of Polybius, there were Achæans"
17038,SECT. IX.,"of Phthiotis. When, 205 years before Christ, Quintius, the Roman"
17039,SECT. IX.,"general, examined into the origin of the Greek cities, and made a"
17040,SECT. IX.,"classification of them[806], the Achæans of Phthiotis were declared to"
17041,SECT. IX.,"be Thessalians: and he appears to use the name for all Phthians, since"
17042,SECT. IX.,"he calls Phaxidas[807] an Achæan, seemingly for no other reason than"
17043,SECT. IX.,"that he was an inhabitant of Melitea, a city of Phthiotis."
17044,SECT. IX.,
17045,SECT. IX.,"I take it then to be sufficiently proved, that Agamemnon and his"
17046,SECT. IX.,"house were the proper heads of the Achæan race, which rose with them."
17047,SECT. IX.,The proof is doubled by the fact that they fell with it: for in the
17048,SECT. IX.,"post-Homeric literature, all of which follows the Dorian conquest, the"
17049,SECT. IX.,Achæan name has ceased to be a living name for the nation of the Greeks.
17050,SECT. IX.,
17051,SECT. IX.,"And as the Pelopids were the leaders of the Achæans, so I now assume it"
17052,SECT. IX.,"to be sufficiently shown from Homer, that the Achæans were in his time"
17053,SECT. IX.,"at the head of all the Hellenic families and tribes; of the Dorians,"
17054,SECT. IX.,"the Æolids, the Cephallenes, and whatever others came from the same"
17055,SECT. IX.,"stock, and were in fact, for their age, the proper type of Hellenism"
17056,SECT. IX.,itself.
17057,SECT. IX.,
17058,SECT. IX.,"That most remarkable supremacy of Agamemnon over the Greek nation,"
17059,SECT. IX.,"which is so strongly marked on the page of Homer, and to the force of"
17060,SECT. IX.,"which Thucydides ascribes the wonderful movement of the Trojan war,"
17061,SECT. IX.,left behind it a tradition which it was thought worth while by the
17062,SECT. IX.,"ruling race of Dorians to appropriate, even after the shipwreck of the"
17063,SECT. IX.,old political system.
17064,SECT. IX.,
17065,SECT. IX.,"Orestes came to the throne of Agamemnon, and Tisamenus to that of"
17066,SECT. IX.,"Orestes. He was cast out by the Heraclids with the Dorians, and they"
17067,SECT. IX.,made Sparta the chief seat of their power. Thus established in the
17068,SECT. IX.,"primacy of Greece, they held it, under the name of Ἡγεμονία, contested"
17069,SECT. IX.,"sometimes, but only after the lapse of several ages, by Athens:"
17070,SECT. IX.,"never absolutely taken away, until it passed, as Polybius says,"
17071,SECT. IX.,"unexpectedly, into the hands of the Thebans, in the fourth century"
17072,SECT. IX.,before the Christian era.
17073,SECT. IX.,
17074,SECT. IX.,"Tisamenus and his Achæans went into Ægialus, and gave it their own"
17075,SECT. IX.,name. But the imperial Spartans found it for their interest to put
17076,SECT. IX.,"in their claim to the old Agamemnonian title. So, as Pausanias[808]"
17077,SECT. IX.,"informs us, even down to his day, the Tomb of Tisamenus was shown in"
17078,SECT. IX.,"Sparta, and hard by it the Lycurgian feast of Pheiditia was kept; with"
17079,SECT. IX.,"a tradition that their fathers, admonished by an oracle, had fetched"
17080,SECT. IX.,the remains of the last Pelopid sovereign from Helice in Achæa. On
17081,SECT. IX.,"the other hand, the Achæans, who in the time of Polybius[809] had not"
17082,SECT. IX.,"yet ceased to keep the image of their legendary ancestor Achæus, and"
17083,SECT. IX.,"whose claim to that image was recognised by the Roman general, likewise"
17084,SECT. IX.,"cherished a tradition that the family of Tisamenus had been continued,"
17085,SECT. IX.,"and had reigned among them down to the time of Ogygus[810], when their"
17086,SECT. IX.,League was formed upon the basis of democratic institutions.
17087,SECT. IX.,
17088,SECT. IX.,_Dorians appropriate the Pelopid succession._
17089,SECT. IX.,
17090,SECT. IX.,"Now it is no more than we might expect, that the Achæans should, in"
17091,SECT. IX.,"their depressed fortunes, fondly cherish the recollections of their"
17092,SECT. IX.,"glory, by preserving and honouring the memory of the last of that race,"
17093,SECT. IX.,"who, through being their sovereigns, were also the heads of the Greek"
17094,SECT. IX.,nation. But why did the Dorians exhibit an anxiety of a kind in their
17095,SECT. IX.,"position so remarkable? Such a feeling could hardly have existed, had"
17096,SECT. IX.,"there not been a special character attaching to the Pelopid race, as"
17097,SECT. IX.,"possessed not only of an actual supremacy, but of some peculiar title"
17098,SECT. IX.,"by descent, to which it was worth the while of the Dorian sovereigns to"
17099,SECT. IX.,"lay claim, as a kind of heirs by adoption. We do not find that when the"
17100,SECT. IX.,"Pelopids came in with their Achæans, they had shown any corresponding"
17101,SECT. IX.,solicitude to connect themselves with the memory of Danaids or of
17102,SECT. IX.,"Perseids: on the contrary, Homer expressly disconnects the dynasties,"
17103,SECT. IX.,"by assigning to the Pelopids a new sceptre, fresh by the hands of"
17104,SECT. IX.,"Mercury from Jupiter. It seems to follow, that in all likelihood the"
17105,SECT. IX.,Pelopids had something which neither Danaids nor Perseids possessed
17106,SECT. IX.,"before them, and which the Dorians too did not hold at all, or did not"
17107,SECT. IX.,"hold by so clear a title: the honour, namely, not of Hellenic blood"
17108,SECT. IX.,"alone, but of being ruled by a family which represented an original and"
17109,SECT. IX.,"primitive sovereignty over the Hellenic nation, through its foremost,"
17110,SECT. IX.,or Achæan tribe.
17111,SECT. IX.,
17112,SECT. IX.,"This is the more remarkable, because the Dorian sovereigns of Sparta"
17113,SECT. IX.,"claimed Hercules, and through him Jupiter, for their progenitor. But"
17114,SECT. IX.,"the patriarchal chieftaincy, though not more directly connected with a"
17115,SECT. IX.,"divine stock, had superadded to it that accumulation of dignity, which"
17116,SECT. IX.,depends upon the unbroken transmission of power from the most remote
17117,SECT. IX.,historic origin: and Hercules was modern in comparison with those to
17118,SECT. IX.,whom some of the Hellenic families were able (as we have seen) to trace
17119,SECT. IX.,their ancestry.
17120,SECT. IX.,
17121,SECT. IX.,Were we to give credit to the common tradition respecting Hellen and
17122,SECT. IX.,"his sons, I admit that it would raise a new difficulty in the way"
17123,SECT. IX.,"of the construction, which I propose to attach to the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν."
17124,SECT. IX.,Instead of seeing Agamemnon invested with it because he is head of the
17125,SECT. IX.,"Achæans, and highly favoured by a special, nay by an almost exclusive"
17126,SECT. IX.,"appropriation of it, because they are the foremost Hellenic tribe,"
17127,SECT. IX.,we should have to own in them the youngest of all the branches from
17128,SECT. IX.,"that stem, with Dorians, Æolians, and Ionians too, taking precedence"
17129,SECT. IX.,"of them: and we should have to look, and look in vain, for any trace"
17130,SECT. IX.,"or presumption whatever of his descent from that Achæus, whom the"
17131,SECT. IX.,tradition feigns to have existed.
17132,SECT. IX.,
17133,SECT. IX.,"But with the acknowledgment of Homer’s historical authority, the credit"
17134,SECT. IX.,of that tradition falls; as indeed it is etymologically self-convicted
17135,SECT. IX.,by the formation of its cardinal name Hellen.
17136,SECT. IX.,
17137,SECT. IX.,The Achæan prominence in Homer rests on grounds sufficiently clear:
17138,SECT. IX.,"over the Ionians, who appear to be not even an Hellenic race; over"
17139,SECT. IX.,"the Dorians, latent in the Pylian town of Dorion, or among the sister"
17140,SECT. IX.,"races of Crete, where they are as yet wholly undistinguished: over the"
17141,SECT. IX.,"Æolids, (for there are no Æolians,) because these are single shoots"
17142,SECT. IX.,"only, while the Achæans are a branch, a principal section of the"
17143,SECT. IX.,"Hellenic race; and also, as I think may be shown[811], because of all"
17144,SECT. IX.,Hellenes they appear really to have had the most normal connection with
17145,SECT. IX.,the true fountain-head of their race.
17146,SECT. IX.,
17147,SECT. IX.,"Nowhere among the Dorians, and (of course, if the Ionians are"
17148,SECT. IX.,"Pelasgian,) nowhere among the Ionians, have we any trace of the name"
17149,SECT. IX.,"ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, or of the thing indicated by it. May not this be the"
17150,SECT. IX.,reason that the Dorian kings of Sparta sought (so to speak) to serve
17151,SECT. IX.,themselves heirs to the house of Agamemnon?
17152,SECT. IX.,
17153,SECT. IX.,"I may observe in passing, as to the Ionians, that it has recently been"
17154,SECT. IX.,"held that they are not only Hellenic, but the oldest Hellenes: that"
17155,SECT. IX.,"they parted from the rest of the race in Asia, came into Greece by"
17156,SECT. IX.,"the islands, and were its great sea-faring race. This theory, ably as"
17157,SECT. IX.,"it has been supported, is but doubtfully agreeable to the positive or"
17158,SECT. IX.,negative evidence of Homer: still it is not less fatal to the current
17159,SECT. IX.,"tradition of Hellen and his family, than that which views the Ionians"
17160,SECT. IX.,as more nearly connected with the Pelasgians[812].
17161,SECT. IX.,
17162,SECT. IX.,"Only among Achæans, Æolids, and Dardanians, do we find the patriarchal"
17163,SECT. IX.,title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. The Dardan house fell with the Trojan war. The
17164,SECT. IX.,throne of Augeias had given way even before that great crisis. It is
17165,SECT. IX.,probable that the line of Euphetes was then no longer in existence;
17166,SECT. IX.,"else we must have heard of it in the Catalogue, or during the action."
17167,SECT. IX.,"The realm of Eumelus was remote and small, and if it had been wrecked"
17168,SECT. IX.,"in the convulsions of the period, it would leave nothing upon which the"
17169,SECT. IX.,Dorians could lay hold as a point of junction with the past. But they
17170,SECT. IX.,"had come into the very dominions of the family of Pelops, though with"
17171,SECT. IX.,a transfer of the metropolis from Mycenæ to Sparta. Here was the true
17172,SECT. IX.,"Greek Patriarchate, of which for purposes of policy they might well"
17173,SECT. IX.,desire to become the ostensible representatives.
17174,SECT. IX.,
17175,SECT. IX.,_Spurious Tradition of the Hellenidæ._
17176,SECT. IX.,
17177,SECT. IX.,The legend of the Hellenidæ might probably be meant to cooperate
17178,SECT. IX.,towards the same end. Its determinate form I have ventured to discard:
17179,SECT. IX.,but its spirit and intention have their importance in connection
17180,SECT. IX.,with the subject of the extraction of the Greeks. It affords early
17181,SECT. IX.,witness to the general belief in the derivation of the Greek races
17182,SECT. IX.,from Thessaly: and though it does not suffice of itself to prove that
17183,SECT. IX.,"a Dorus or an Ion came from thence, yet it is of great importance as a"
17184,SECT. IX.,"testimony to their general connection with Thessaly, and it powerfully"
17185,SECT. IX.,corroborates evidence such as Homer affords to that effect in the
17186,SECT. IX.,case of the Achæans. Nor are we entirely without Homeric evidence of
17187,SECT. IX.,"a connection between the Dorians and the Achæans, and thus between"
17188,SECT. IX.,the Dorians and Thessaly. For the Dorians are found in Crete together
17189,SECT. IX.,"with the Achæans (Od. xix.), and in the dominions of Nestor peopled by"
17190,SECT. IX.,"Achæans we find the town called Δώριον, Il. ii. 594. As, however, the"
17191,SECT. IX.,great Dorian mass came into Peloponnesus not under a family of Dorian
17192,SECT. IX.,"rulers, but under Heraclids, their connection with the old Hellas was"
17193,SECT. IX.,"not maintained by any regal tradition, and hence perhaps the need of"
17194,SECT. IX.,the legend of Hellen to revive the memory of it.
17195,SECT. IX.,
17196,SECT. IX.,Let us now endeavour to gather together the threads of the argument.
17197,SECT. IX.,
17198,SECT. IX.,It is plain that Agamemnon was not called ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν on account of
17199,SECT. IX.,"his great monarchy; because other great monarchs want the title, and,"
17200,SECT. IX.,"again, other insignificant lords hold it."
17201,SECT. IX.,
17202,SECT. IX.,Nor did he possess it on the ground of autochthonism: for the Achæans
17203,SECT. IX.,"were immigrants into the Peloponnesus, and not autochthons, and they"
17204,SECT. IX.,had been preceded by other races.
17205,SECT. IX.,
17206,SECT. IX.,Neither was it borne by him on the ground of a divine descent more
17207,SECT. IX.,direct or more illustrious than that of others: for his divine descent
17208,SECT. IX.,"would in that case at least have been specifically stated, instead of"
17209,SECT. IX.,being left to remote and hazardous inference. Nor is the title borne
17210,SECT. IX.,"by Achilles, who was the great grandson of Jupiter, or by Hercules or"
17211,SECT. IX.,"Minos, who were his sons."
17212,SECT. IX.,
17213,SECT. IX.,"If sovereignty and antiquity be connected with the title, they are"
17214,SECT. IX.,not of themselves sufficient to confer it: and if divine descent be a
17215,SECT. IX.,"condition of it, this must be joined with other conditions."
17216,SECT. IX.,
17217,SECT. IX.,"These negatives, established in the case of Agamemnon, leave room, I"
17218,SECT. IX.,"believe, for but one supposition; namely, that the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν must"
17219,SECT. IX.,"indicate chieftaincy, or in other words, the lineal headship, passing"
17220,SECT. IX.,"by seniority, of one among the ruling or royal houses, who represent"
17221,SECT. IX.,"the stem of a particular race, in his case the Achæan branch of the"
17222,SECT. IX.,"Hellenic family; and who govern, and have continuously governed, those"
17223,SECT. IX.,of their own name or branch. Of these royal houses there might be
17224,SECT. IX.,"many, allied together by common derivation, at the same or different"
17225,SECT. IX.,"epochs, from a common stem."
17226,SECT. IX.,
17227,SECT. IX.,_Summary of the Evidence._
17228,SECT. IX.,
17229,SECT. IX.,"In sum, the Homeric picture appears to be as follows."
17230,SECT. IX.,
17231,SECT. IX.,"First we have the remote and wintry Dodona of Thessaly, the most"
17232,SECT. IX.,ancient and most awful seat of the religious worship of the Greeks; in
17233,SECT. IX.,connection with which Achilles invokes Jupiter for the success and safe
17234,SECT. IX.,return of Patroclus.
17235,SECT. IX.,
17236,SECT. IX.,Around Dodona dwell the Selli or Helli. The special veneration paid to
17237,SECT. IX.,the place points it out as the oldest site of the national worship;
17238,SECT. IX.,and the possession of this oldest site again points out the tribe as
17239,SECT. IX.,"the mother-tribe of that wonderful Greek race, whose fame is graven"
17240,SECT. IX.,ineffaceably upon the rock with a pen of iron.
17241,SECT. IX.,
17242,SECT. IX.,"From among the Helli of the mountains, who nowhere appear among the"
17243,SECT. IX.,"contingents of the Greek army, must have proceeded the migratory bands"
17244,SECT. IX.,who gave to the Thessalian plain the name of Hellas. Their descendants
17245,SECT. IX.,"fix themselves as settlers there. Beguiled into civilization, they"
17246,SECT. IX.,"become Hellenes; they spread, by their inborn elastic energies, towards"
17247,SECT. IX.,"the south, and carry with them, only a little in their rear, the very"
17248,SECT. IX.,"title of their Hellenic origin, as well as their own peculiar name."
17249,SECT. IX.,
17250,SECT. IX.,The ruling families of their septs or clans give each to its actual
17251,SECT. IX.,"head, if not to its heir, the dignity of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, and this title"
17252,SECT. IX.,they carry forth with them to the southern provinces in which they
17253,SECT. IX.,plant themselves.
17254,SECT. IX.,
17255,SECT. IX.,"One of these ruling families, the head of the great sept of the"
17256,SECT. IX.,"Achæans, carries the right to this title in the case of Agamemnon: and"
17257,SECT. IX.,inasmuch as it betokens what is both oldest and highest in descent and
17258,SECT. IX.,"in civil authority in the whole group of the Hellenic tribes, it forms"
17259,SECT. IX.,an appropriate and characteristic designation for their chief ruler and
17260,SECT. IX.,leader.
17261,SECT. IX.,
17262,SECT. IX.,"Having thus considered the case of Agamemnon, the great Achæan"
17263,SECT. IX.,"chieftain, in this view, we may proceed to the other cases of Anchises"
17264,SECT. IX.,"and Æneas, of Augeias, Euphetes, and Eumelus."
17265,SECT. IX.,
17266,SECT. IX.,"In none of these cases, however, have we the same right to assume"
17267,SECT. IX.,_in limine_ the character of chieftainship by known lineage from an
17268,SECT. IX.,"Hellenic family, as in the case of the Achæans. The cases of Anchises"
17269,SECT. IX.,and Æneas may indeed be treated on grounds of their own. In the other
17270,SECT. IX.,"instances, we must inquire what ground Homer furnishes for especially"
17271,SECT. IX.,"connecting these persons with the headship of ruling families, and with"
17272,SECT. IX.,Hellas or Thessaly.
17273,SECT. IX.,
17274,SECT. IX.,"This I shall do, subject to the general rule, that if in any particular"
17275,SECT. IX.,case there can be found a special mark of connection with Thessaly
17276,SECT. IX.,"or Hellas in or about a particular spot, it is thereupon to be"
17277,SECT. IX.,inferred that in that particular place the connection was known and
17278,SECT. IX.,"commemorated. If, for example, we find at a given point an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν,"
17279,SECT. IX.,"reason binds us to presume that, as the local name might show the"
17280,SECT. IX.,"derivation from the first seat of the race, so by this title the lineal"
17281,SECT. IX.,descent from a ruling family there was meant to be commemorated and
17282,SECT. IX.,marked.
17283,SECT. IX.,
17284,SECT. IX.,
17285,SECT. IX.,_The Cases of Anchises and Æneas._
17286,SECT. IX.,
17287,SECT. IX.,But first for Anchises and Æneas.
17288,SECT. IX.,
17289,SECT. IX.,Homer is the historian as well as the poet of Greece: but he is neither
17290,SECT. IX.,"the poet nor the historian of Troy, further than as it was necessary"
17291,SECT. IX.,for him to describe generally to the Greeks the race with whom they had
17292,SECT. IX.,been engaged in a death-struggle.
17293,SECT. IX.,
17294,SECT. IX.,"The strong resemblance between the two nations, and especially their"
17295,SECT. IX.,"partaking, to a certain extent, of a common lineage, seems to have"
17296,SECT. IX.,constituted a difficulty in his way. Already in his time the sentiment
17297,SECT. IX.,of Greek nationality was strong. Whether he chiefly found or made it
17298,SECT. IX.,"so, is nothing to the present purpose. This sentiment of nationality"
17299,SECT. IX.,"required to be circumscribed by a clear line, marking the extent of"
17300,SECT. IX.,the Greek political organisation; and if it was unfavourable to the
17301,SECT. IX.,"acknowledgment of relationship to any race beyond that line, especially"
17302,SECT. IX.,was it so in the case of a race that the Greeks had conquered. Probably
17303,SECT. IX.,therefore the purpose of Homer required that he should instinctively as
17304,SECT. IX.,it were keep in special obscurity the notes of kindred between the two
17305,SECT. IX.,countries.
17306,SECT. IX.,
17307,SECT. IX.,"In the case of the Greeks, Homer has intelligibly pointed out the"
17308,SECT. IX.,origin of the race among the hills of Northern Thessaly round the
17309,SECT. IX.,"ancient Dodona, and near Olympus, its poetical counterpart, and the"
17310,SECT. IX.,residence of Jupiter with his gorgeous train. Yet more clearly has
17311,SECT. IX.,he in the case of the Trojans enabled us to trace them to their
17312,SECT. IX.,"fountain-head, again in the mountains, and beside the roots, of Ida,"
17313,SECT. IX.,where they worshipped the Idæan Jove[813]. We have here the race
17314,SECT. IX.,"without predecessors, residing in the very spot where they were planted"
17315,SECT. IX.,"by their divine progenitor, and coming down by a clear line of seven"
17316,SECT. IX.,generations to the cousins Hector and Æneas.
17317,SECT. IX.,
17318,SECT. IX.,But although the conditions of chieftaincy are thus obviously fulfilled
17319,SECT. IX.,"in the race of Dardanus, yet difficulty presents itself in a new form."
17320,SECT. IX.,"Why is the term ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν applied to Anchises and to his son Æneas,"
17321,SECT. IX.,"but never to Priam, or to his son Hector, or to any of his family?"
17322,SECT. IX.,
17323,SECT. IX.,The answer to this question opens a curious chapter of Homeric history
17324,SECT. IX.,and speculation. In going through it I shall endeavour carefully to
17325,SECT. IX.,"separate between positive statement, and interpretation or conjecture."
17326,SECT. IX.,
17327,SECT. IX.,These facts then are on the face of the poem.
17328,SECT. IX.,
17329,SECT. IX.,1. Anchises nowhere personally appears in it. And yet there was at
17330,SECT. IX.,Troy an assembly of δημογέροντες (Il. iii. 146-8). Of the persons
17331,SECT. IX.,"there mentioned, Lampus, Clytius, and Hiketaon were brothers of Priam;"
17332,SECT. IX.,"others, for example, Panthus and Antenor, were in the exercise of at"
17333,SECT. IX.,"the very least a subaltern sovereignty. They were present at Troy,"
17334,SECT. IX.,"while their sons fought in the Trojan ranks. The reason, therefore, of"
17335,SECT. IX.,the absence of Anchises is not to be sought in his being represented
17336,SECT. IX.,"by Æneas. Nor in the immunity of his dominions, through their being"
17337,SECT. IX.,"placed among the mountains, from war: for Æneas himself, before he"
17338,SECT. IX.,"came to Troy, had only been rescued by divine interposition from the"
17339,SECT. IX.,hands of Achilles[814]. Why then does Anchises never appear? Either
17340,SECT. IX.,"surely because of the high rank of his sovereignty, or because of some"
17341,SECT. IX.,unexplained rivalry between the families.
17342,SECT. IX.,
17343,SECT. IX.,_Evidence as to Æneas._
17344,SECT. IX.,
17345,SECT. IX.,2. It does not appear that Æneas took any part in the councils of
17346,SECT. IX.,the Trojans. But still he is always represented as a personage of
17347,SECT. IX.,"the greatest importance. It is said of him, as of Hector, θεὸς δ’ ὡς"
17348,SECT. IX.,τίετο δήμῳ[815]. Yet his character would seem to be wholly unmarked
17349,SECT. IX.,"by any great or striking quality, such as we find in Sarpedon and in"
17350,SECT. IX.,Polydamas. Something peculiar then in his birth and position must have
17351,SECT. IX.,"been the cause of the importance attached to him, as it is not to be"
17352,SECT. IX.,found in his personal qualities.
17353,SECT. IX.,
17354,SECT. IX.,"3. Accordingly, there are clear indications of a jealousy between"
17355,SECT. IX.,Æneas himself and the Trojan royal family. In the great battle of B. x.
17356,SECT. IX.,"118, Deiphobus, wanting aid, goes to seek Æneas (459-61)."
17357,SECT. IX.,
17358,SECT. IX.,τὸν δ’ ὕστατον εὗρεν ὁμίλου
17359,SECT. IX.,ἐστάοτ’· αἰεὶ γὰρ Πριάμῳ ἐπεμήνιε δίῳ
17360,SECT. IX.,"οὕνεκ’ ἀρ’, ἔσθλον ἔοντα μετ’ ἀνδράσιν, οὔτι τίεσκεν."
17361,SECT. IX.,
17362,SECT. IX.,"Now this aversion is wholly foreign to the character of Priam, which"
17363,SECT. IX.,was genial and kindly: nor can it be accounted for by any thing in the
17364,SECT. IX.,"very neutral character of Æneas. There is an opinion of some critics,"
17365,SECT. IX.,that he and Anchises had given offence by advising the restoration of
17366,SECT. IX.,"Helen. This, however, seems (B. iii. 159) to have been the general"
17367,SECT. IX.,"wish of the δημογέροντες, to whom it is expressly ascribed; and it is"
17368,SECT. IX.,"Antenor, who proposes it in the Assembly; why then should it not, if"
17369,SECT. IX.,"it existed, be mentioned by Homer in the case of Æneas and Anchises?"
17370,SECT. IX.,"Yet there is not the faintest reference to it. It would still,"
17371,SECT. IX.,"however, appear insufficient to account for the feeling imputed to"
17372,SECT. IX.,"Priam. Coupling it with the high position of Æneas, and the absence of"
17373,SECT. IX.,"Anchises, I cannot but think there is most probably a reference here"
17374,SECT. IX.,"to the headship of the family, which is designated by the term ἄναξ"
17375,SECT. IX.,ἀνδρῶν. Nothing could be more natural than this jealousy between the
17376,SECT. IX.,"recent and wealthy city of the plain on the one hand, and the ancient"
17377,SECT. IX.,"but comparatively poor city of the hills on the other, if the ruling"
17378,SECT. IX.,family of Dardania claimed by seniority the chieftaincy of the race.
17379,SECT. IX.,
17380,SECT. IX.,4. Another remarkable indication of the peculiar position of Æneas is
17381,SECT. IX.,"afforded by the taunt of Achilles (Il. xx. 179-83),"
17382,SECT. IX.,
17383,SECT. IX.,ἦ σέ γε θυμὸς ἐμοὶ μαχέσασθαι ἀνώγει
17384,SECT. IX.,ἐλπόμενον Τρώεσσιν ἀνάξειν ἱπποδάμοισιν
17385,SECT. IX.,τιμῆς τῆς Πριάμου;
17386,SECT. IX.,
17387,SECT. IX.,"‘But you will not get it,’ he proceeds, ‘for Priam has children of his"
17388,SECT. IX.,"own, and is no fool.’"
17389,SECT. IX.,
17390,SECT. IX.,"To this taunt Æneas makes no reply, except by stating his genealogy,"
17391,SECT. IX.,for which Achilles had not asked. Is not this very like justifying his
17392,SECT. IX.,expectation of the throne? or what other connecting link can be pointed
17393,SECT. IX.,"out between the taunt of Achilles, and the genealogy given in answer to"
17394,SECT. IX.,the challenge it conveyed?
17395,SECT. IX.,
17396,SECT. IX.,"5. While Ilion, the city of Priam, was later by several generations,"
17397,SECT. IX.,"probably having been founded in the reign of Ilus, Anchises reigned in"
17398,SECT. IX.,"Dardania, the original seat (Il. xx. 216) of the race. The fact of his"
17399,SECT. IX.,sovereignty there seems to be indicated by our finding Æneas in command
17400,SECT. IX.,"of the Dardanians, with two sons of Antenor, who probably served as"
17401,SECT. IX.,his lieutenants (ii. 819-23): by the connection which that passage
17402,SECT. IX.,"establishes between Anchises and the hill country, inhabited (Il. xx."
17403,SECT. IX.,216) by the Dardanians; by the division of the royal line at the point
17404,SECT. IX.,where the Ilian name first appears (Il. xx. 231); and by a number of
17405,SECT. IX.,"places showing the high position in the army which Æneas held, as head"
17406,SECT. IX.,of the Dardanian force.
17407,SECT. IX.,
17408,SECT. IX.,6. The rank of Æneas was without any rival or parallel in the Trojan
17409,SECT. IX.,"army, except Hector. Though strictly speaking Dardanian, he is"
17410,SECT. IX.,addressed as
17411,SECT. IX.,
17412,SECT. IX.,"Αἰνεία, Τρώων βουλήφορε·"
17413,SECT. IX.,
17414,SECT. IX.,"His name is often combined with that of Hector, and when so combined"
17415,SECT. IX.,"frequently precedes it. Thus we have (vi. 75),"
17416,SECT. IX.,
17417,SECT. IX.,εἰ μὴ ἄρ’ Αἰνείᾳ τε καὶ Ἕκτορι εἶπε κ.τ.λ.
17418,SECT. IX.,
17419,SECT. IX.,"To this are subjoined, by Helenus, words which assign to Æneas a parity"
17420,SECT. IX.,of command with Hector:
17421,SECT. IX.,
17422,SECT. IX.,"Αἰνεία τε καὶ Ἕκτορ, ἐπεὶ πόνος ὔμμι μάλιστα"
17423,SECT. IX.,Τρώων καὶ Λυκίων ἐγκέκλιται[816].
17424,SECT. IX.,
17425,SECT. IX.,If it be thought that metrical considerations had to do with putting
17426,SECT. IX.,"Æneas in these places as well as in xx. 240, before Hector, so they"
17427,SECT. IX.,might have to do with placing Ilus before Assaracus in the genealogy.
17428,SECT. IX.,
17429,SECT. IX.,"It is asserted of him by Mars in the person of Acamas, Il. v. 467,"
17430,SECT. IX.,
17431,SECT. IX.,"κεῖται ἀνὴρ ὅντ’ ἶσον ἐτίομεν Ἕκτορι δίῳ,"
17432,SECT. IX.,"Αἰνείας, υἱὸς μεγαλήτορος Ἀγχίσαο."
17433,SECT. IX.,
17434,SECT. IX.,"Lastly, we have the prophecy of Neptune that the sceptre of Dardanus"
17435,SECT. IX.,should continue in the line of Anchises (Il. xx. 302-8).
17436,SECT. IX.,
17437,SECT. IX.,"And, as regards the application to Æneas of the title which properly"
17438,SECT. IX.,"belonged to Anchises, this seems to connect itself with the practice"
17439,SECT. IX.,"of the heroic age as to a devolution of sovereignty, either partial or"
17440,SECT. IX.,"total, by aged men upon their heirs. We seem to find another example"
17441,SECT. IX.,"of this in the case of Eumelus; and the instances of Achilles, and"
17442,SECT. IX.,"especially of Ulysses, are also in point."
17443,SECT. IX.,
17444,SECT. IX.,7. As the character of Æneas does not account for the jealousy felt
17445,SECT. IX.,"towards him, so neither does his conduct. He nowhere thwarts Hector by"
17446,SECT. IX.,"opposition, or tries him by advice that he is not inclined to take. Of"
17447,SECT. IX.,this course of proceeding we have an instance; but it is in Polydamas.
17448,SECT. IX.,"If, then, neither the character nor the conduct of Æneas supply the"
17449,SECT. IX.,"explanation, we must look for it in some claims that he was entitled"
17450,SECT. IX.,"to make in virtue of lineage, and that consequently attracted jealousy"
17451,SECT. IX.,towards him.
17452,SECT. IX.,
17453,SECT. IX.,8. Although it has been assumed that Priam was the head of the Trojan
17454,SECT. IX.,"race and federation, this is not stated by Homer. In Il. xxiv. 544"
17455,SECT. IX.,"it is only said that he excelled the other princes of that region,"
17456,SECT. IX.,"(1) in his wealth, and (2) in the number, or possibly it may mean the"
17457,SECT. IX.,"excellence of his sons. On the contrary, it is doubtful, by the mere"
17458,SECT. IX.,"words of the poem, whether Priam represented the senior or the junior"
17459,SECT. IX.,"line, and when we compare and draw inferences from the text, we may"
17460,SECT. IX.,"arrive at the conclusion that it was the junior line, quite as easily"
17461,SECT. IX.,"as at an opposite one; especially if we shall find, that the rights of"
17462,SECT. IX.,"seniority itself were less determinate in Troas, than in Greece."
17463,SECT. IX.,
17464,SECT. IX.,"In the genealogy of the Twentieth Book, we find no assistance towards"
17465,SECT. IX.,"elucidating this question, except in the precedence given to names. The"
17466,SECT. IX.,three sons of Tros stand in the following order:
17467,SECT. IX.,
17468,SECT. IX.,1. Ilus.
17469,SECT. IX.,2. Assaracus.
17470,SECT. IX.,3. Ganymedes.
17471,SECT. IX.,
17472,SECT. IX.,Then (1) the fate of Ganymedes is described;
17473,SECT. IX.,
17474,SECT. IX.,(2) the line of Ilus is traced down to Priam;
17475,SECT. IX.,
17476,SECT. IX.,(3) that of Assaracus is traced to Anchises.
17477,SECT. IX.,
17478,SECT. IX.,"Here the line of Priam has precedence: but on the other hand, lastly,"
17479,SECT. IX.,"Æneas proceeds to state his own birth from Anchises, before that of"
17480,SECT. IX.,"Hector from Priam,"
17481,SECT. IX.,
17482,SECT. IX.,"αὐτὰρ ἔμ’ Ἀγχίσης, Πρίαμος δ’ ἔτεχ’ Ἕκτορα δῖον[817]."
17483,SECT. IX.,
17484,SECT. IX.,"9. In the Fifth Iliad we learn, that Jupiter presented some horses"
17485,SECT. IX.,"of a particular breed to Tros, as a compensation for the loss of his"
17486,SECT. IX.,son Ganymedes. Anchises brought his mares to them in the time of
17487,SECT. IX.,"Laomedon without leave, and thus got possession of the breed. And it"
17488,SECT. IX.,is in this place that Homer calls him ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν[818]. It may also
17489,SECT. IX.,"be observed that this was the act of a young man; for Laomedon, on"
17490,SECT. IX.,"whom he played this trick, was one generation higher in the family"
17491,SECT. IX.,"tree. It is here shown undoubtedly that the horses of Tros, the common"
17492,SECT. IX.,"ancestor, descended to the line of Priam; which was the more wealthy"
17493,SECT. IX.,"and powerful, and occupied the plain country, where the horses fed in"
17494,SECT. IX.,"great numbers (xx. 221); but again, does it not seem as if this very"
17495,SECT. IX.,proceeding of Anchises may have had reference to a rivalry between the
17496,SECT. IX.,"two houses, and a claim on his part to the headship of the family?"
17497,SECT. IX.,especially from the use in this very narrative of the phrase ἄναξ
17498,SECT. IX.,"ἀνδρῶν for Anchises (v. 268), and shortly after for his heir Æneas (v."
17499,SECT. IX.,311).
17500,SECT. IX.,
17501,SECT. IX.,_Summary of the Evidence._
17502,SECT. IX.,
17503,SECT. IX.,To sum up the evidence. We find the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν applied to
17504,SECT. IX.,two persons only among the Trojans. Those two are a father advanced
17505,SECT. IX.,"in years, and his heir apparent. The father is plainly enough the"
17506,SECT. IX.,"sovereign of Dardania, as well as descended from Dardanus; and"
17507,SECT. IX.,"Dardania, though secondary in power, was the original seat of the race."
17508,SECT. IX.,We cannot say positively whether Anchises represented the elder or the
17509,SECT. IX.,younger branch of the family: for precedence of name is sometimes given
17510,SECT. IX.,"to one, and sometimes to the other line. But as Troy was powerful, and"
17511,SECT. IX.,"Dardania poor, we can understand the precedence of the Trojan line,"
17512,SECT. IX.,even although it be supposed junior: whereas it seems difficult to
17513,SECT. IX.,"account for the fact that the precedence is sometimes given to Æneas,"
17514,SECT. IX.,"or for the jealousy felt both towards him, and by him, except on the"
17515,SECT. IX.,supposition that his family in its humbler circumstances either were
17516,SECT. IX.,"the rightful representatives of Dardanus, whose sceptre, after the"
17517,SECT. IX.,"fall of Troy, Æneas and his sons were undoubtedly to transmit[819]; or"
17518,SECT. IX.,"at least were in a condition, whether by primogeniture in Assaracus,"
17519,SECT. IX.,"or whether by holding the original seat of the race, to make fair and"
17520,SECT. IX.,plausible pretensions to the distinction.
17521,SECT. IX.,
17522,SECT. IX.,"It is important to bear in mind, that we have not the same clear"
17523,SECT. IX.,"assertion of the right of the elder branch to succeed to power in Asia,"
17524,SECT. IX.,"which the cases of Agamemnon, Protesilaus, Thrasymedes, and perhaps"
17525,SECT. IX.,"others, supply in Greece. On the contrary, we shall find Sarpedon"
17526,SECT. IX.,"first leader of the Lycians, though of a junior branch to Glaucus, and"
17527,SECT. IX.,likewise representing only the female line. We shall also find great
17528,SECT. IX.,"reason to question whether Hector, even if he was the heir expectant"
17529,SECT. IX.,"of the succession, was not, nevertheless, junior to Paris. This want"
17530,SECT. IX.,of definiteness in the rule of succession is exactly what would bring
17531,SECT. IX.,"it into dispute, and perhaps into prolonged dispute. And if the right"
17532,SECT. IX.,"of seniority was not fully acknowledged in Asia, this would at once"
17533,SECT. IX.,"explain, why Homer did not observe an uniform order in the genealogy:"
17534,SECT. IX.,perhaps it might also explain his not being historically aware what
17535,SECT. IX.,that order was.
17536,SECT. IX.,
17537,SECT. IX.,"If this be so, the apparent anomaly of the application, on the Trojan"
17538,SECT. IX.,"side, to secondary persons only of the title so constantly given to the"
17539,SECT. IX.,"highest Greek, disappears, and becomes the consistent application of a"
17540,SECT. IX.,rule. And Anchises with Æneas may then offer the most perfect model of
17541,SECT. IX.,"the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, as uniting with continued sovereignty not only known"
17542,SECT. IX.,"lineal descent from the first ancestor, and from Jupiter, but also the"
17543,SECT. IX.,continued possession of the original seat.
17544,SECT. IX.,
17545,SECT. IX.,"It may however be asked, why, even if we allow that ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν"
17546,SECT. IX.,"is among the Greeks a title of patriarchal chieftaincy, should we"
17547,SECT. IX.,therefore assume that it had the same defined meaning among a people of
17548,SECT. IX.,different blood and institutions?
17549,SECT. IX.,
17550,SECT. IX.,Let me briefly answer this question.
17551,SECT. IX.,
17552,SECT. IX.,It is to the Helli that we have looked back as the most probable
17553,SECT. IX.,"source of those ideas and institutions of clanship, which gave rise"
17554,SECT. IX.,"to the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. But the Helli were a mountain people,"
17555,SECT. IX.,"(for they were around the wintry Dodona,) and so were the Dardanians:"
17556,SECT. IX.,"and the institutions of highlanders in different parts, even at wide"
17557,SECT. IX.,"intervals of space and time, often present strong mutual resemblances."
17558,SECT. IX.,The limited means and pursuits of man in such a physical position check
17559,SECT. IX.,"development, and tend to maintain uniformity."
17560,SECT. IX.,
17561,SECT. IX.,"The Dardan highlanders worshipped Jupiter on Ida, as the Helli"
17562,SECT. IX.,"worshipped him at Dodona. That it was the same Jupiter, we may infer"
17563,SECT. IX.,"with the greatest confidence, from the fact that Homer makes one"
17564,SECT. IX.,formula of invocation common to his Trojans and his Greeks[820].
17565,SECT. IX.,
17566,SECT. IX.,ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν Ἀχαιῶν τε Τρώων τε·
17567,SECT. IX.,"Ζεῦ πάτερ, Ἴδηθεν μεδέων, κύδιστε, μέγιστε, κ.τ.λ."
17568,SECT. IX.,
17569,SECT. IX.,"The bulk of the religion was nearly the same on both sides, as far as"
17570,SECT. IX.,the principal deities were concerned.
17571,SECT. IX.,
17572,SECT. IX.,_Signs of kin between Trojans and Greeks._
17573,SECT. IX.,
17574,SECT. IX.,"As the first among the proofs of affinity in blood, I should be"
17575,SECT. IX.,"inclined to cite that very visit of Paris to Menelaus, which gave"
17576,SECT. IX.,occasion to the war. We have no other instance recorded in Homer
17577,SECT. IX.,"of a foreign prince, received as such in domestic hospitality by a"
17578,SECT. IX.,"Greek chieftain. Nor can we, inversely, find that Greek chieftains"
17579,SECT. IX.,were similarly entertained by foreigners. We have indeed an account
17580,SECT. IX.,of gifts received by Menelaus in Egypt[821]; and we have the kindly
17581,SECT. IX.,reception by the Egyptian king and his people of the Pseudo-Ulysses as
17582,SECT. IX.,"a suppliant[822]; and the similar entertainment of Ulysses, again as a"
17583,SECT. IX.,"suppliant, in Scheria. But these cases fall greatly short of the case"
17584,SECT. IX.,"of Paris. Again, Homer calls the Egyptians ἀλλόθροοι ἄνθρωποι[823]: and"
17585,SECT. IX.,"that phrase is an usual one with him, evidently representing a familiar"
17586,SECT. IX.,"idea. But he never calls the Trojans ἀλλόθροοι, nor speaks of them as"
17587,SECT. IX.,having different manners or religion from the Greeks. The strongest
17588,SECT. IX.,word applied to them is ἀλλοδάπος[824]. But this word seems to mean
17589,SECT. IX.,"simply ‘from another place,’ and does not convey the proper and full"
17590,SECT. IX.,idea of a foreigner. For not only the Lycian Sarpedon is an ἀλλοδάπος
17591,SECT. IX.,"to the Trojans, but Greek pirates are usually said to attack ἀλλοδάποι,"
17592,SECT. IX.,"whereas they evidently were wont to plunder those of their own nation,"
17593,SECT. IX.,"even down to the time of Thucydides: and above all Eumæus, disgusted"
17594,SECT. IX.,"and worn out with the profligate misdeeds of the Suitors, thinks of"
17595,SECT. IX.,"moving off ἄνδρας ἐς ἀλλοδάπους, together with his oxen (ἰόντ’ αὐτῇσι"
17596,SECT. IX.,"βόεσσιν), by which he could not have meant more than a short passage to"
17597,SECT. IX.,"the Greek continent[825]. On the whole, I think that all this permits"
17598,SECT. IX.,"the supposition that the Trojans were admitted to be a kindred, though"
17599,SECT. IX.,they were not a Greek people.
17600,SECT. IX.,
17601,SECT. IX.,"But further, the poems are full of testimony to the affinities between"
17602,SECT. IX.,the Trojans and the Greeks. It is true they also bear witness to
17603,SECT. IX.,considerable differences: but both nations had been settled in the
17604,SECT. IX.,"plain country for several generations before the Trojan War; and, with"
17605,SECT. IX.,"the growth of agriculture and trade, arts and wealth, they might well"
17606,SECT. IX.,have diverged from the close parallelism of a ruder age.
17607,SECT. IX.,
17608,SECT. IX.,"At this point, however, we must call to mind some matters, which have"
17609,SECT. IX.,been more largely discussed already.
17610,SECT. IX.,
17611,SECT. IX.,"Among these resemblances of a general character it may be observed,"
17612,SECT. IX.,that there evidently are Pelasgi on both sides of the great quarrel.
17613,SECT. IX.,The Πελασγοὶ of the Trojans are among the ἐπίκουροι (Il. ii. 840): the
17614,SECT. IX.,"Πελασγοὶ of the Greeks appear as one of the Cretan races, distinct from"
17615,SECT. IX.,"the Dorians and Achæans, and probably as the first founders of those"
17616,SECT. IX.,"lowland settlements in Thessaly (ii. 681), over which the Hellenic and"
17617,SECT. IX.,Achæan names seem principally to have prevailed. Thus the Pelasgian
17618,SECT. IX.,"name forms a decided bond of union between the two races: though, from"
17619,SECT. IX.,"the Poet’s mentioning it on the Trojan, and suppressing it on the Greek"
17620,SECT. IX.,"side, we at once infer that the Pelasgian element was stronger and more"
17621,SECT. IX.,palpable among the Trojans.
17622,SECT. IX.,
17623,SECT. IX.,_Signs connected with the Helli._
17624,SECT. IX.,
17625,SECT. IX.,"Next, it may be recollected that, according both to antecedent"
17626,SECT. IX.,"probability and to tradition, those Helli who colonized the tract"
17627,SECT. IX.,"about Dodona must have come from, that is, come by way of, Dardania."
17628,SECT. IX.,"There is thus every likelihood of a similarity, either of race or of"
17629,SECT. IX.,"manners, between those who passed onwards, and those who dropped off"
17630,SECT. IX.,"the movement, and remained behind."
17631,SECT. IX.,
17632,SECT. IX.,"Nor are there wanting some indications, small in amount, but"
17633,SECT. IX.,"trustworthy in their nature, of primitive identity between the Dardans,"
17634,SECT. IX.,"or some portion of them, and the Helli."
17635,SECT. IX.,
17636,SECT. IX.,The Trojan Catalogue divides itself into two principal parts. The
17637,SECT. IX.,latter of these (840-877) recites the names of the allied nations.
17638,SECT. IX.,The former (816-39) mentions no names of races but the Trojan and
17639,SECT. IX.,"Dardanian; which were really one, and were even in name sometimes"
17640,SECT. IX.,"treated as identical: for Æneas is addressed, though commander of the"
17641,SECT. IX.,"Dardans[826], as"
17642,SECT. IX.,
17643,SECT. IX.,"Αἰνεία, Τρώων βουλήφορε."
17644,SECT. IX.,
17645,SECT. IX.,This division of the Catalogue is clearly indicated by the verse which
17646,SECT. IX.,"introduces it,"
17647,SECT. IX.,
17648,SECT. IX.,ἔνθα τότε Τρῶές τε διέκριθεν ἠδ’ ἐπίκουροι·
17649,SECT. IX.,
17650,SECT. IX.,where the word Τρῶες evidently includes the Dardanians.
17651,SECT. IX.,
17652,SECT. IX.,"And that every thing is Trojan, or Dardan, which lies within the"
17653,SECT. IX.,"division, vv. 816-839, may further be inferred from Dolon’s description"
17654,SECT. IX.,of the bivouac of the ἐπίκουροι in Il. x. 428-31. He enumerates
17655,SECT. IX.,"nine nations, some of whom appear among the eleven described in Il."
17656,SECT. IX.,"ii. 840-77, but not one among those portions of the force which are"
17657,SECT. IX.,"described 816-839. I therefore gather, that every thing in this part of"
17658,SECT. IX.,the Catalogue is strictly Trojan or Dardan. But here we have
17659,SECT. IX.,
17660,SECT. IX.,"Ἄσιος Ὑρτακίδης, ὃν Ἀρίσβηθεν φέρον ἵπποι"
17661,SECT. IX.,"αἴθωνες μεγάλοι, ποταμοῦ ἀπὸ Σελλήεντος."
17662,SECT. IX.,
17663,SECT. IX.,"The mention of this river is repeated in Il. xii. 96, 7."
17664,SECT. IX.,
17665,SECT. IX.,Now the name of a river Selleeis at once suggests a connection with the
17666,SECT. IX.,"tribe of Selli or Helli: and further on we shall find, that Ephyre is a"
17667,SECT. IX.,"sign of the Helli, as Larissa is of the Pelasgi, and that one at least"
17668,SECT. IX.,"of the Ephyres of Greece, probably one situated in Thessaly, was by a"
17669,SECT. IX.,"river Selleeis. In later times Sicyon[827], and in Homer Elis, if not"
17670,SECT. IX.,"Thessaly, show each their Ephyre with a river Selleeis."
17671,SECT. IX.,
17672,SECT. IX.,"It has been already noticed, that in the Games of the Twenty-third"
17673,SECT. IX.,"Iliad, Homer tells us that the σόλος, or ball of iron given by Achilles"
17674,SECT. IX.,"as a prize, had previously been hurled by the strong arm of king"
17675,SECT. IX.,Eetion. And as all the traces of gymnastic exercises in Homer lead us
17676,SECT. IX.,"to refer them to Hellic families, we may perhaps be justified in taking"
17677,SECT. IX.,"this as an indication that Eetion, the father of Andromache, belonged"
17678,SECT. IX.,to this stock.
17679,SECT. IX.,
17680,SECT. IX.,_The Hellespont of Homer._
17681,SECT. IX.,
17682,SECT. IX.,Another trace of the name of the Helli is found in the grammatical
17683,SECT. IX.,structure of the ancient Homeric word Hellespont. Its composition
17684,SECT. IX.,declares it to be the sea of Helle. Helle would be the descriptive
17685,SECT. IX.,name of a woman of the tribe of Helli. Nor could any thing be more
17686,SECT. IX.,"natural, than that the Strait and neighbouring water should take its"
17687,SECT. IX.,"appellation from the tribe of Helli, or even from a person of that"
17688,SECT. IX.,"tribe, when we have every reason to believe they made the passage in"
17689,SECT. IX.,the course of their migration westward.
17690,SECT. IX.,
17691,SECT. IX.,"In later times, the name Hellespont has been restricted to the narrow"
17692,SECT. IX.,strait between the Sea of Marmora and the Archipelago. In Homer it bore
17693,SECT. IX.,"this sense, at least occasionally or inclusively, because he calls it"
17694,SECT. IX.,"ἀγάῤῥοος[828]. At other times he calls it πλατὺς, and the commentators"
17695,SECT. IX.,have been much puzzled to show how a narrow strait could be a broad
17696,SECT. IX.,"one, while the interpretation _salt_ has also been suggested for the"
17697,SECT. IX.,"epithet. It is just possible, that this adjective might apply to what"
17698,SECT. IX.,"was afterwards known as the Hellespont, and might describe it as broad,"
17699,SECT. IX.,in comparison with the bay in which lay the Greek ships: but it is much
17700,SECT. IX.,"more natural to construe it more freely, and to understand by it the"
17701,SECT. IX.,"broad Hellespont, in opposition to the narrow Hellespont; that is, the"
17702,SECT. IX.,"open sea, in opposition to the ἀγάῤῥοος, which signifies the Strait."
17703,SECT. IX.,The expression πλατὺς Ἑλλήσποντος is used but thrice; once[829] for
17704,SECT. IX.,"the water near the part of the camp occupied by Achilles, which we"
17705,SECT. IX.,"know was by the open sea[830], and twice[831] with reference to the"
17706,SECT. IX.,"sepulchral mounds which were to be erected there, and for which the"
17707,SECT. IX.,"most conspicuous spot would of course be chosen. What πλατὺς suggests,"
17708,SECT. IX.,"another epithet, ἀπείρων[832], surely requires: for it is incredible"
17709,SECT. IX.,"that this word should be applied to the mere Strait. And in truth,"
17710,SECT. IX.,"independently of epithets, it is demonstrable that the word in Homer"
17711,SECT. IX.,"sometimes means, not the strait, but the Archipelago. For Achilles,"
17712,SECT. IX.,"announcing his intention to sail home, says he will be seen passing"
17713,SECT. IX.,"Ἑλλήσποντον ἐπ’ ἰχθυόεντα[833], _over_ the Hellespont, which, having"
17714,SECT. IX.,"his vessels already at the mouth of it, he clearly could not do if it"
17715,SECT. IX.,"meant the strait only. And, in truth, the etymology of the word speaks"
17716,SECT. IX.,for itself: the Greeks never would have given the name πόντος at all
17717,SECT. IX.,"to a narrow strip of water. The connection, which was thus established"
17718,SECT. IX.,"between this quarter and Greece through the medium of the name Helle,"
17719,SECT. IX.,was recognised by the later Greeks: but they naturally altered its
17720,SECT. IX.,"form, by keeping to their own country the honours of the fountain-head,"
17721,SECT. IX.,while they made the eastward traces of the name to be secondary and
17722,SECT. IX.,"derivative. In Apollonius, Phryxus and Helle are the children of"
17723,SECT. IX.,"Athamas, and grandchildren of Æolus: and they are carried from Thessaly"
17724,SECT. IX.,"on the back of a ram to the Troic sea, where she is dropped, and"
17725,SECT. IX.,gives her name to it. This tradition is summed up in the argument to
17726,SECT. IX.,"the Argonautica, and exhibits the belief of the Greeks in the early"
17727,SECT. IX.,relationship of the countries.
17728,SECT. IX.,
17729,SECT. IX.,All this marks the Helli not only as a people who had crossed the
17730,SECT. IX.,"straits, but as one which had left its name associated with the"
17731,SECT. IX.,"northern coast of the Ægean, and moreover upon the country in the"
17732,SECT. IX.,"neighbourhood of the straits, up to the river Selleeis; a stream which"
17733,SECT. IX.,"we see must have been at a considerable distance beyond Troy, because"
17734,SECT. IX.,all the rivers that descended from Mount Ida were employed in clearing
17735,SECT. IX.,"away the Greek earthworks, and this one is not among them[834]."
17736,SECT. IX.,
17737,SECT. IX.,_The gift of Echepolus._
17738,SECT. IX.,
17739,SECT. IX.,We find an insulated yet remarkable note of kin between the Dardan
17740,SECT. IX.,house and the Greeks in the case of Echepolus. He was a son of
17741,SECT. IX.,"Anchises, and he resided in Sicyon. He was possessed of great wealth,"
17742,SECT. IX.,and apparently he had also the fine breed of horses which was in his
17743,SECT. IX.,"family: for he presented Agamemnon with the mare Αἴθη[835], as a"
17744,SECT. IX.,consideration for not being required to follow him against Troy.
17745,SECT. IX.,
17746,SECT. IX.,Now there was evidently at this time no commercial class formed in
17747,SECT. IX.,Greece. Echepolus must therefore have had a territorial fortune. To
17748,SECT. IX.,"find a wealthy member of the Dardan house domesticated in Greece, and"
17749,SECT. IX.,"peacefully remaining there during the expedition, must excite some"
17750,SECT. IX.,surprise. It seems to supply a new and strong presumption of the Hellic
17751,SECT. IX.,"origin of the royal families of Troas. The name too, and the gift"
17752,SECT. IX.,"of a horse, are in remarkable conformity with the horse-rearing and"
17753,SECT. IX.,horse-breaking pursuits of the highest Trojans.
17754,SECT. IX.,
17755,SECT. IX.,We have already seen stray signs of the Pelasgic affinities between
17756,SECT. IX.,"the two contending parties: but it would now appear, that there were"
17757,SECT. IX.,"affinities in the Hellic line also: and if so, then this institution of"
17758,SECT. IX.,"chieftaincy, standing above merely political supremacy, and indicated"
17759,SECT. IX.,"by the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, may probably have subsisted among Trojans as"
17760,SECT. IX.,well as Greeks.
17761,SECT. IX.,
17762,SECT. IX.,"The less warlike character of the Trojans, their more oriental"
17763,SECT. IX.,"manners, and their less multiform and imaginative religion, all point"
17764,SECT. IX.,to considerable differences in the composition of the people. The
17765,SECT. IX.,Pelasgic ingredient was probably stronger in Troy: it appears to have
17766,SECT. IX.,"had more influence over religion, manners, and institutions. But the"
17767,SECT. IX.,circumstances mentioned above are tokens of an infusion of Hellic
17768,SECT. IX.,blood in the populations that inhabited Troas. Now this was nowhere so
17769,SECT. IX.,likely to be found as in the royal family; for we see the governing
17770,SECT. IX.,"faculty everywhere accompanying the Hellic tribes through Greece, and"
17771,SECT. IX.,"asserting itself both by the acquisition of political power, and by the"
17772,SECT. IX.,"energetic use of it. Everywhere it rises, by a natural buoyancy, to the"
17773,SECT. IX.,"summit of society; and gives their first vent, in miniature, to those"
17774,SECT. IX.,"energies, which were afterwards to defy, or even to subdue the world."
17775,SECT. IX.,
17776,SECT. IX.,"At the same time, though it is in connection with the Hellic families"
17777,SECT. IX.,"alone that we find the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν among the Greeks, we need not"
17778,SECT. IX.,proceed so far as to deny the possibility that it might also have been
17779,SECT. IX.,"a Pelasgic institution, and that its non-appearance, in connection with"
17780,SECT. IX.,"their name, might be sufficiently accounted for simply by their loss"
17781,SECT. IX.,of political power. We have no reason to suppose the Pelasgi and Helli
17782,SECT. IX.,to have been families of mankind whose characters were in radical and
17783,SECT. IX.,absolute opposition to one another: the completeness of their fusion
17784,SECT. IX.,"after a short period seems to prove, that, though with a different"
17785,SECT. IX.,"distribution of capacities and tendencies, they must have had many and"
17786,SECT. IX.,important points of contact.
17787,SECT. IX.,
17788,SECT. IX.,
17789,SECT. IX.,IV. _Case of Augeias._
17790,SECT. IX.,
17791,SECT. IX.,Let us take next the case of Augeias.
17792,SECT. IX.,
17793,SECT. IX.,He appears in three passages of the Iliad.
17794,SECT. IX.,
17795,SECT. IX.,"1. The Epeans, who inhabited Elis, with Bouprasium and other towns"
17796,SECT. IX.,"enumerated in the Catalogue, and lying in the north-western corner"
17797,SECT. IX.,"of the Peloponnesus, sent to the Trojan war forty ships, in four"
17798,SECT. IX.,"divisions, under four separate leaders, and without any head over"
17799,SECT. IX.,"the whole contingent. The fourth named of these is Polyxeinus, son of"
17800,SECT. IX.,"Agasthenes, himself a lord (ἄναξ), and the son of Augeias."
17801,SECT. IX.,
17802,SECT. IX.,"2. In the Eleventh Book, Nestor gives the curious history of the war of"
17803,SECT. IX.,"his boyhood or earliest youth, between the Elians (v. 671), called also"
17804,SECT. IX.,"Epeans (688), and the Pylians."
17805,SECT. IX.,
17806,SECT. IX.,Neleus had sent to Elis a chariot with four horses to contend in the
17807,SECT. IX.,"games, of which a tripod was the prize. The horses were detained by"
17808,SECT. IX.,Augeias (v. 701).
17809,SECT. IX.,
17810,SECT. IX.,τοὺς δ’ αὖθι ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Αὐγείας
17811,SECT. IX.,κάσχεθε.
17812,SECT. IX.,
17813,SECT. IX.,"Nestor and the Pylians invaded Elis in return, and brought off an"
17814,SECT. IX.,immense booty. The Elians then took arms and besieged Thryoessa (in
17815,SECT. IX.,"the Catalogue Thryon), the border city of Pylos, at the ford of the"
17816,SECT. IX.,Alpheus. Minerva brought the tidings to Pylos. The Pylian forces spent
17817,SECT. IX.,"one night on the boundary river Minyeius, and marched to the Alpheus,"
17818,SECT. IX.,beside which they spent a second night.
17819,SECT. IX.,
17820,SECT. IX.,"3. In the morning the battle was fought: the Epeans were defeated,"
17821,SECT. IX.,"and driven all the way to Bouprasium and the Olenian rock, upon the"
17822,SECT. IX.,"sea shore, in the western part of what was afterwards Achæa. There"
17823,SECT. IX.,"Pallas turned them back. The Pylians, who returned home, are called"
17824,SECT. IX.,Achæans[836].
17825,SECT. IX.,
17826,SECT. IX.,Nestor in the first fight had slain a warrior named Μούλιος. He was the
17827,SECT. IX.,"son-in-law of Augeias, married to his eldest daughter Agamede, who was"
17828,SECT. IX.,profoundly skilled in drugs (v. 741);
17829,SECT. IX.,
17830,SECT. IX.,"ἣ τόσα φάρμακα ᾔδη, ὅσα τρέφει εὐρεῖα χθών."
17831,SECT. IX.,
17832,SECT. IX.,"K. O. Müller (Orchomenus, p. 355) infers from the Catalogue, that"
17833,SECT. IX.,Augeias was lord only of a fourth part of Elis. But this assumption
17834,SECT. IX.,"seems quite gratuitous in connection with the passage in the Catalogue,"
17835,SECT. IX.,and utterly in contradiction to the tenour of the history of the Pylian
17836,SECT. IX.,"raid in B. xi. On the contrary, I infer with considerable confidence,"
17837,SECT. IX.,"from the acephalous state of the Elian division of the army, in which"
17838,SECT. IX.,"it differs from the other divisions, that there had been a revolution"
17839,SECT. IX.,"in that state since the time of Augeias; and if so, then indirectly the"
17840,SECT. IX.,Catalogue confirms the Elian monarchy described in the Eleventh Book.
17841,SECT. IX.,
17842,SECT. IX.,"Thus then we find this ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, Augeias, lord of Elis two"
17843,SECT. IX.,"generations before the Trojan war. He is neighbour to Achæans, whom"
17844,SECT. IX.,we have already traced in Hellas: and he appears to have belonged to
17845,SECT. IX.,"the same national origin with them, because they sent their chariots"
17846,SECT. IX.,"to run races at his games. Again, the fact of his holding these games"
17847,SECT. IX.,"at all, and at a place which subsequently contended for and obtained"
17848,SECT. IX.,the superintendence of the great national assemblages celebrated at
17849,SECT. IX.,"Olympia, testifies to his known connection with the cradle of the"
17850,SECT. IX.,race whose custom it was to celebrate them; because these festivities
17851,SECT. IX.,"had a religious and national character, and as such could not but"
17852,SECT. IX.,have depended very greatly upon traditionary title. This race we have
17853,SECT. IX.,previously found to be the Hellenic race.
17854,SECT. IX.,
17855,SECT. IX.,_Notes of connection between Elis and the North._
17856,SECT. IX.,
17857,SECT. IX.,We may however find other indications of the descent of Augeias
17858,SECT. IX.,"from a ruling Hellenic family, in local and personal notices which"
17859,SECT. IX.,"connect Elis, his own territory, with the north, and with Thessaly in"
17860,SECT. IX.,particular.
17861,SECT. IX.,
17862,SECT. IX.,For example: it was at the Alpheus in Elis that Thamyris suffered his
17863,SECT. IX.,"calamity: and he was coming at the time from Œchalia[837], in the"
17864,SECT. IX.,"valley of the Upper Peneus, a part of the Homeric Thessaly or Hellas"
17865,SECT. IX.,proper. (Il. ii. 730.)
17866,SECT. IX.,
17867,SECT. IX.,"The name Θρῂξ, too, which is applied to him, never seems to have spread"
17868,SECT. IX.,farther southwards than the hills about Thessaly.
17869,SECT. IX.,
17870,SECT. IX.,"Further, he was coming from Eurytus of Œchalia, who is again named as"
17871,SECT. IX.,"the lord, apparently, of that city, in ii. 730. But the name Eurytus"
17872,SECT. IX.,"was one current among the descendants of Actor[838], for a descendant"
17873,SECT. IX.,of Actor who bore it is named in the Catalogue a little below: and this
17874,SECT. IX.,latter Eurytus was an Epean chief: and the descendants of Actor are
17875,SECT. IX.,"found in the Epean or Elian army of the Eleventh Book. (xi. 709, 739.)"
17876,SECT. IX.,
17877,SECT. IX.,"Again, they are found in Thessaly or Phthiotis, for when Mercury had"
17878,SECT. IX.,"deflowered Polymele, the daughter of Phylas a Thessalian, Echecles,"
17879,SECT. IX.,"a descendant of Actor, married her; and yet again, they are found"
17880,SECT. IX.,"near Aspledon[839] and the Minyeian Orchomenos, between Bœotia and"
17881,SECT. IX.,Phocis[840].
17882,SECT. IX.,
17883,SECT. IX.,"Again, the Pylian army halted, at a day’s march from the Alpheus, on"
17884,SECT. IX.,"the Minyeius, a river evidently named from the Minyæ of Peloponnesus."
17885,SECT. IX.,"But there was a Minya also in Thessaly[841], of which the site was not"
17886,SECT. IX.,precisely known in historic times: and the northern Orchomenos was
17887,SECT. IX.,called Minyeius[842].
17888,SECT. IX.,
17889,SECT. IX.,There is no part of Middle or of Southern Greece which so abounds in
17890,SECT. IX.,the local and personal notes of connection with Thessaly and the North
17891,SECT. IX.,as Elis and its neighbourhood. Some indications of it have already been
17892,SECT. IX.,"given, and many more might be added. As for example, there was an"
17893,SECT. IX.,"Enipeus[843], a river of Elis, so there was of Pieria and of Phthiotis."
17894,SECT. IX.,"Doris, beneath Œta, is reflected or prefigured in the Homeric Dorium"
17895,SECT. IX.,"of the Pylian territories: the Thessalian Larissa in a Larissa, and a"
17896,SECT. IX.,"river Larissus, of Elis. The Thessalian name Œchalia is repeated in the"
17897,SECT. IX.,"district, over which Nestor ruled at the epoch of the _Troica_; and"
17898,SECT. IX.,there is an Arcadian Orchomenos as well as a northern one. Cyparissus
17899,SECT. IX.,"in Elis corresponds, again, with a Cyparissus in Phocis. Some other"
17900,SECT. IX.,more doubtful indications may close the list. The Parrhasie of Arcadia
17901,SECT. IX.,may be from the same root with the Πύρασος[844] of the dominions of
17902,SECT. IX.,Protesilaus. Perhaps the Thessalian Helos and Pteleos may be akin to
17903,SECT. IX.,Alos in the country of Peleus[845]. The resemblance of names is not
17904,SECT. IX.,"confined to the extremities of the line, but is scattered along the"
17905,SECT. IX.,path of migration from north to south. It extends also to Laconia.
17906,SECT. IX.,
17907,SECT. IX.,"Nestor in his youth is summoned all the way from Pylos (τηλόθεν), to"
17908,SECT. IX.,"fight with Pirithous and others in Thessaly; (from whence Polypœtes,"
17909,SECT. IX.,"the son of Pirithous, led a division of the Greek army,) against the"
17910,SECT. IX.,Φῆρες.
17911,SECT. IX.,
17912,SECT. IX.,"Thus far we find some presumptions as to the descent of Augeias, as to"
17913,SECT. IX.,"his connection with the Hellic institution of the games, and as to the"
17914,SECT. IX.,"relation between Elis, over which he reigned, and the line northwards"
17915,SECT. IX.,"into Thessaly; all tending, together with the evidently Hellic"
17916,SECT. IX.,"character of the Epeans, to shew that he was the representative of one"
17917,SECT. IX.,of their ruling tribes.
17918,SECT. IX.,
17919,SECT. IX.,"But he also bears a distinct local mark, the nature of which I shall"
17920,SECT. IX.,now endeavour to investigate.
17921,SECT. IX.,
17922,SECT. IX.,The chieftainship of Agamemnon has been traced and identified by
17923,SECT. IX.,"means of his Achæan connection, without any assistance from local or"
17924,SECT. IX.,territorial names connected with the abode of his family.
17925,SECT. IX.,
17926,SECT. IX.,"In such a case as his, we could not look for aid of that description:"
17927,SECT. IX.,for his house had only been possessed for two generations of their
17928,SECT. IX.,dominions: we have no precise knowledge before that time of the place
17929,SECT. IX.,"of their sojourn: and when they rose to power, it was in a territory,"
17930,SECT. IX.,"and in cities, which appear to have been already of historic fame. It"
17931,SECT. IX.,"was not therefore likely that their abodes should bear names such as,"
17932,SECT. IX.,"if they had come in the characters of founders and not of inheritors,"
17933,SECT. IX.,they would probably have affixed to them.
17934,SECT. IX.,
17935,SECT. IX.,"In the case of the Dardan house, we have found, among other indications"
17936,SECT. IX.,"of their Hellic affinities, the two evidently Hellic names of the"
17937,SECT. IX.,Hellespont and the River Selleeis.
17938,SECT. IX.,
17939,SECT. IX.,_The name of Ephyre._
17940,SECT. IX.,
17941,SECT. IX.,There is another local name in Homer of paramount importance as a key
17942,SECT. IX.,"to the question respecting the ruling Hellic tribes, the name of Ephyre"
17943,SECT. IX.,(Ἐφύρη).
17944,SECT. IX.,
17945,SECT. IX.,Let us endeavour to collect the scattered lights which either the
17946,SECT. IX.,"etymology, or the use and associations of the term in Homer, may supply."
17947,SECT. IX.,
17948,SECT. IX.,_Its cognate names._
17949,SECT. IX.,
17950,SECT. IX.,"And, first, we may notice in Homer a large cluster of names which are"
17951,SECT. IX.,"found running over Greece, and which are evidently in etymological"
17952,SECT. IX.,"association with one another: I will bring these together, before"
17953,SECT. IX.,endeavouring to estimate their relation to the name Ephyre.
17954,SECT. IX.,
17955,SECT. IX.,"1. Φᾶρις, Il. ii. 582. In Lacedæmon."
17956,SECT. IX.,
17957,SECT. IX.,"2. Φεραὶ, Il. ii. 711. In Thessaly."
17958,SECT. IX.,
17959,SECT. IX.,"3. Φήρη, Il. v. 543. Between Pylus and Sparta."
17960,SECT. IX.,
17961,SECT. IX.,"4. Φήραι, Il. ix. 151, 293. Od. iii. 488. The same."
17962,SECT. IX.,
17963,SECT. IX.,"5. Φεαὶ, Od. xv. 296[846]. Otherwise read Φεραὶ, and, according to the"
17964,SECT. IX.,"Scholiast, the same with Φῆραι. The site is on the sea, between Pylus"
17965,SECT. IX.,and Sparta.
17966,SECT. IX.,
17967,SECT. IX.,"6. Φεῖα, Il. vii. 135. On the Iardanus: and probably also on"
17968,SECT. IX.,"the Arcadian frontier towards Pylus: but, in the opinion of the"
17969,SECT. IX.,"Scholiast[847], the same with Φεαί."
17970,SECT. IX.,
17971,SECT. IX.,"Besides these names of places, we have also,"
17972,SECT. IX.,
17973,SECT. IX.,"1. Φηρητιάδης, Il. ii. 763. xxiii. 376, the name of Eumelus; who was"
17974,SECT. IX.,"the son of Admetus, the lord of Φεραὶ in Il. ii. 711."
17975,SECT. IX.,
17976,SECT. IX.,"2. Φέρης, one of the sons of Cretheus, a Thessalian king, Od. xi. 259."
17977,SECT. IX.,
17978,SECT. IX.,"3. The Φῆρες, termed ὀρέσκῳοι in Il. i. 268, and λαχνηέντες in Il. ii."
17979,SECT. IX.,"743; the shaggy mountaineers, on whom Pirithous made war, when he was"
17980,SECT. IX.,attended by Nestor.
17981,SECT. IX.,
17982,SECT. IX.,"With respect to the six local names, and the two first of the three"
17983,SECT. IX.,"personal names, there can be little doubt of their identity in root."
17984,SECT. IX.,"It is directly probable from the text, that Φήρη and Φηραὶ were the"
17985,SECT. IX.,"same place. The name of Eumelus, who lives at Φεραὶ, and who is the"
17986,SECT. IX.,"grandson of Φέρης, yet is called Φηρητιάδης, clearly establishes the"
17987,SECT. IX.,"etymological relationship. Thus there is, again, no difficulty whatever"
17988,SECT. IX.,"in recognising between Φεραὶ and Φεαὶ, or again between Φεαὶ and Φείαι;"
17989,SECT. IX.,and it is in the manner of Homer to give the name of the same country
17990,SECT. IX.,"both in the singular and in the plural, as Μυκήνη, Il. iv. 52, and"
17991,SECT. IX.,"Μυκηναὶ, Il. ii. 569. Φᾶρις, the only remaining name, gives us the"
17992,SECT. IX.,"Doric or Æolic α for η, and an altered form of declension. This however"
17993,SECT. IX.,"is not at all incompatible with the manner of Homer, who not only uses"
17994,SECT. IX.,"Πηνελόπη and Πηνελόπεια, Ἀστυόχη and Ἀστυόχεια, Πηρείη (according"
17995,SECT. IX.,"to one reading), Il. ii. 766, and Πιερίη, Od. v. 50, but Ἑρμῆς and"
17996,SECT. IX.,"Ἑρμείας, Πατροκλέης and Πατρόκλος; and for towns, the Θρύον of Il. ii."
17997,SECT. IX.,591 appears again as Θρυόεσσα in Il. xi. 711.
17998,SECT. IX.,
17999,SECT. IX.,"In general it is to be remembered that the instrument of language, at"
18000,SECT. IX.,the time when Homer lived was as yet in a highly elastic state: it was
18001,SECT. IX.,"in the state as it were of gristle; it had not yet hardened into bone,"
18002,SECT. IX.,nor assumed the strict conventional forms which a formed literature
18003,SECT. IX.,requires. And for the same reasons that it has presented variations as
18004,SECT. IX.,"between one time and another, it could not but do the like as between"
18005,SECT. IX.,one place and another.
18006,SECT. IX.,
18007,SECT. IX.,The very same causes which made change a law of language would give to
18008,SECT. IX.,"that course of change in one place a greater, and in another a less"
18009,SECT. IX.,"velocity, older forms succumbing at a given time in one place, and yet"
18010,SECT. IX.,surviving in another. Such a state of facts around him would give great
18011,SECT. IX.,"liberty to a poet, independently of the exigencies of his verse; which"
18012,SECT. IX.,"appear indeed to have caused to such a man, and with such a language,"
18013,SECT. IX.,little difficulty.
18014,SECT. IX.,
18015,SECT. IX.,But we hardly require the benefit of these general considerations to
18016,SECT. IX.,cover the case of a varying declension for the name of a town. The true
18017,SECT. IX.,"explanation probably is the very simple one, that in one declension it"
18018,SECT. IX.,"has been used substantively, and in the other adjectively. And this"
18019,SECT. IX.,will be the more plain if we consider that the name of the town would
18020,SECT. IX.,"usually be the representative of an idea, either in conjunction with a"
18021,SECT. IX.,"person, or directly. Thus θρύον is _a rush_, and θρυοεὶς _rushy_. The"
18022,SECT. IX.,"town Θρύον in the Catalogue is at the ford of the Alpheus, and in Il."
18023,SECT. IX.,"xi. 711 it is τις Θρυόεσσα πόλις, αἰπεῖα κολώνη, which exhibits to us"
18024,SECT. IX.,the adjective use in an actual example. So again by analogy we might
18025,SECT. IX.,"have Φῆρις from Φήρα or Φήρη, as πάτρις from πάτρα, ἀναλκὶς from ἄλκη."
18026,SECT. IX.,
18027,SECT. IX.,We have a curious extra-Homeric remnant of geographical evidence with
18028,SECT. IX.,"respect to this Pharis. Pausanias[848] relates to us, that the place"
18029,SECT. IX.,"where it was reported to have stood was in his time called Alesiæ, and"
18030,SECT. IX.,that near it there was a river bearing the peculiar name of Phellias;
18031,SECT. IX.,which it seems most natural to regard as a corrupted form of the
18032,SECT. IX.,Homeric name Σελληείς. This connection of Pharis with Selleeis becomes
18033,SECT. IX.,"in its turn an argument for relationship between Pharis and Ephyre,"
18034,SECT. IX.,with which Selleeis is associated in the places where Homer mentions it
18035,SECT. IX.,as the name of a Greek river.
18036,SECT. IX.,
18037,SECT. IX.,"Nor are we without other traces, in this region, of that name which so"
18038,SECT. IX.,often attends upon Ephyre: for Laconia had for its key on the north the
18039,SECT. IX.,town of Sellasia[849]. The Προέληνοι of Arcadia should also here be
18040,SECT. IX.,borne in mind.
18041,SECT. IX.,
18042,SECT. IX.,Thus then we appear to find the name of Ephyre according to one or
18043,SECT. IX.,"other of its forms in Laconia, in Pylus, and in that part of Thessaly"
18044,SECT. IX.,which was ruled by Admetus. The ruling race in the two former was
18045,SECT. IX.,"Achæan, and therefore Hellic. Admetus was himself an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, and"
18046,SECT. IX.,"his Hellic origin will be shown presently. So far, therefore, we have a"
18047,SECT. IX.,presumption established that the name of Ephyre signifies some peculiar
18048,SECT. IX.,connection with the Helli.
18049,SECT. IX.,
18050,SECT. IX.,Etymologically it is obvious to connect these words with ἔρα as their
18051,SECT. IX.,"root, and to suppose that they retain the prefix, which it had lost in"
18052,SECT. IX.,"the common Greek usage even before the days of Homer, as he employs"
18053,SECT. IX.,ἔραζε without the digamma: and which prefix we find reproduced in the
18054,SECT. IX.,Latin _terra_.
18055,SECT. IX.,
18056,SECT. IX.,_The Φῆρες._
18057,SECT. IX.,
18058,SECT. IX.,Let us now pass on to the Φῆρες.
18059,SECT. IX.,
18060,SECT. IX.,"The Φῆρες of Homer are, like the Ἕλλοι, a mountain people, Il. i. 268,"
18061,SECT. IX.,"rude in manners (ii. 743), and aggressive upon the inhabitants of the"
18062,SECT. IX.,"plains; for the war in which Nestor engaged was evidently retributive,"
18063,SECT. IX.,"as the expression used is ἐτίσατο[850], Pirithous ‘_paid them off_;’"
18064,SECT. IX.,"and he was sovereign of a part of the plain country, called Pelasgic"
18065,SECT. IX.,Argos. Nor does any adverse presumption arise from our finding a Hellic
18066,SECT. IX.,"tribe (if such they were) of the mountains, making war on tribes of"
18067,SECT. IX.,similar origin in the plain: any more than we are surprised at war
18068,SECT. IX.,"between the Pylians and the Epeans, both apparently Hellic, though"
18069,SECT. IX.,probably not both Achæan.
18070,SECT. IX.,
18071,SECT. IX.,"It may be well to remember, that the Dardans of Homer are often"
18072,SECT. IX.,included in Trojans; as well as often separately designated: and that
18073,SECT. IX.,the Cephallenians are also apparently included among his Ἀχαιοί.
18074,SECT. IX.,Neither of these pairs of names are territorial: while in each pair one
18075,SECT. IX.,probably indicates a subdivision of the other.
18076,SECT. IX.,
18077,SECT. IX.,"The Φῆρες thus resembling the Ἕλλοι, we are led by their designation"
18078,SECT. IX.,to another link between the name of Φῆραι with its cognates and the
18079,SECT. IX.,Hellic race. It seems thus far as if Φηραὶ were the appropriate name of
18080,SECT. IX.,a settlement formed by Φῆρες.
18081,SECT. IX.,
18082,SECT. IX.,"Having proceeded thus far, we may now observe the relation of the word"
18083,SECT. IX.,"Φὴρ,"
18084,SECT. IX.,
18085,SECT. IX.,"1. To the Greek ἔρα, which evidently, from its passing into the Latin"
18086,SECT. IX.,"_terra_, had at one time a Greek prefix. With this we may probably"
18087,SECT. IX.,"associate the Greek ἔαρ, and the Latin _ver_."
18088,SECT. IX.,
18089,SECT. IX.,"2. To the Greek θὴρ, a wild beast."
18090,SECT. IX.,
18091,SECT. IX.,"3. To the Latin _fera_, with the same meaning."
18092,SECT. IX.,
18093,SECT. IX.,"4. To the Latin _terra_, meaning the earth."
18094,SECT. IX.,
18095,SECT. IX.,"5. To the Italian _terra_, the old classical name, in that beautiful"
18096,SECT. IX.,"tongue, not for a district, but for an inclosed, walled, or fortified"
18097,SECT. IX.,"place. This word seems in Italian to be rarely, if at all, used for a"
18098,SECT. IX.,"district, but so generally for a town, that it is difficult to suppose"
18099,SECT. IX.,"the signification was derived in the same manner as Argos in Greek,"
18100,SECT. IX.,from the tract of country in which it was situated. In Italian _terra_
18101,SECT. IX.,"seems often to mean _tellus_, often _humus_, very rarely _ager_,"
18102,SECT. IX.,"constantly _oppidum_ or _castrum_. Thus in Dante (Inferno, C., v. 97),"
18103,SECT. IX.,"‘_Siede_ la terra, dove nata fui.’"
18104,SECT. IX.,
18105,SECT. IX.,"This being so, it is natural to suppose that, while the correlative"
18106,SECT. IX.,"of the Greek ἔρα became in Latin _terra_, so as directly to signify"
18107,SECT. IX.,"_tellus_ or _humus_, that of the Greek Φηρὰ became in Italian _terra_,"
18108,SECT. IX.,"so as to signify a walled place; or, in other words, that the original"
18109,SECT. IX.,"word, whatever it was, of the common mother language, which became Φηρὰ"
18110,SECT. IX.,"in Greek, in Italy became _terra_ for this latter purpose. The exchange"
18111,SECT. IX.,of θ for _t_ we see in ἐσθὴς becoming _vestis_: and of _t_ for _f_ (=
18112,SECT. IX.,φ) in τρυγάω compared with _fruges_.
18113,SECT. IX.,
18114,SECT. IX.,This sense of _terra_ seems to have dropped altogether out of the
18115,SECT. IX.,"Latin, and especially Pelasgian, branch of the old Italian tongue."
18116,SECT. IX.,
18117,SECT. IX.,"The relation between Φὴρ and θὴρ, the one applicable to men, and the"
18118,SECT. IX.,"other to wild beasts, appears evidently to throw us back upon that"
18119,SECT. IX.,"which the mountain tribes of men had in common with animals, namely, a"
18120,SECT. IX.,"wild and savage life, and the free possession of the earth. Thus the"
18121,SECT. IX.,"two stand in a common and near relation to the word ἔρα, the earth, and"
18122,SECT. IX.,they seem to have ἐρ or ἠρ for their common root.
18123,SECT. IX.,
18124,SECT. IX.,"Before passing on to Ἐφύρη, I would remark that in this instance again"
18125,SECT. IX.,we seem to derive light from Homer’s unequalled point and precision
18126,SECT. IX.,in the use of epithets. His Φῆρες appear to be in fact the rude and
18127,SECT. IX.,"uncombed mountaineers, who also have the name of Ἕλλοι in the same or"
18128,SECT. IX.,"other tribes. These Φῆρες are λαχνηέντες, shaggy. They come down to"
18129,SECT. IX.,"the plains, and acquire settled and civilised habits: from Φῆρες they"
18130,SECT. IX.,"are become Ἀχαιοὶ, but their long hair has not left them, and from"
18131,SECT. IX.,λαχνηέντες they are now καρηκομόωντες.
18132,SECT. IX.,
18133,SECT. IX.,Now we find the word Ἐφύρη used many times in Homer: and once we have
18134,SECT. IX.,"the name Ἔφυροι, applied to a people apparently Thessalian, on whom"
18135,SECT. IX.,"Mars[851], with his son Φόβος, makes war from out of Thrace."
18136,SECT. IX.,
18137,SECT. IX.,_Etymology of Ἐφύρη._
18138,SECT. IX.,
18139,SECT. IX.,"Can we then presume an etymological connection between the word Ἐφύρη,"
18140,SECT. IX.,"and that group of words which we have been discussing, and which we"
18141,SECT. IX.,have found to show marks of connection with the Helli?
18142,SECT. IX.,
18143,SECT. IX.,"For if so, then we shall be supported by various other reasons, which,"
18144,SECT. IX.,"as we shall find, connect the word Ephyre with the Hellic races in a"
18145,SECT. IX.,very remarkable manner.
18146,SECT. IX.,
18147,SECT. IX.,"What we have here to consider is,"
18148,SECT. IX.,
18149,SECT. IX.,1. The prefix ε.
18150,SECT. IX.,
18151,SECT. IX.,2. The change of ε or η for υ.
18152,SECT. IX.,
18153,SECT. IX.,"Dr. Donaldson[852] has given a list of Greek words which have, as"
18154,SECT. IX.,"prefixes unconnected with the root, sometimes the letter α, sometimes"
18155,SECT. IX.,"ε, sometimes ο."
18156,SECT. IX.,
18157,SECT. IX.,Such in the second class are
18158,SECT. IX.,
18159,SECT. IX.,"ἐ-ρέφω, whence roof."
18160,SECT. IX.,"ἐ-λεύθερος, whence liber."
18161,SECT. IX.,"ἐ-ρυθρὸς, whence ruber, rufus."
18162,SECT. IX.,"ἐ-ρετμὸς, whence remus."
18163,SECT. IX.,
18164,SECT. IX.,"This point being disposed of, how are we to account for finding φυρη,"
18165,SECT. IX.,instead of φερη or φηρη?
18166,SECT. IX.,
18167,SECT. IX.,"Can it be because, in cases of Greek syllabic augment, there is a"
18168,SECT. IX.,"tendency to avoid reduplication, as in ἀτιτάλλω for ἀτατάλλω? In but"
18169,SECT. IX.,a small proportion of the cases given in Dr. Donaldson’s table is the
18170,SECT. IX.,vowel prefix the same with the vowel following.
18171,SECT. IX.,
18172,SECT. IX.,Can it be from that tendency of what we call comprehensively the
18173,SECT. IX.,"digamma to lapse into the υ, which Heyne has observed[853]?"
18174,SECT. IX.,
18175,SECT. IX.,"Or, shall we found it on the principles laid down by Bopp[854], in his"
18176,SECT. IX.,"Comparative Grammar, that the α has a tendency to weaken itself into υ,"
18177,SECT. IX.,"and that liquids having a preference for that latter vowel, influence"
18178,SECT. IX.,the generation of it? the conditions of interchange between α and υ
18179,SECT. IX.,"resting, as he says, upon the laws of gravity or vocal equilibrium."
18180,SECT. IX.,
18181,SECT. IX.,"It must be observed that the original vowel of the root may, in this"
18182,SECT. IX.,"case, have been the α which we find in φᾶρις."
18183,SECT. IX.,
18184,SECT. IX.,It is not only α that we may find supplanted by υ. The ε suffers the
18185,SECT. IX.,"same fate in the Italian _Siculus_, which appears as the representative"
18186,SECT. IX.,"of the Greek Σίκελος. Again we have, in the Latin, the kindred words"
18187,SECT. IX.,_furo_ and _fera_. Perhaps I am wrong in dealing thus scrupulously
18188,SECT. IX.,"with the variation from ε to υ, as if capable of affecting vitally the"
18189,SECT. IX.,question of identity in the root. For in examining another root (that
18190,SECT. IX.,"of κεφάλη), we have seen that its derivatives appear to include the"
18191,SECT. IX.,"whole, or nearly the whole range of the vowels of the alphabet."
18192,SECT. IX.,
18193,SECT. IX.,_Its probable signification._
18194,SECT. IX.,
18195,SECT. IX.,"Upon the whole it appears not unsafe, without pretending to any"
18196,SECT. IX.,"authoritative solution of a question fitted for philological scholars,"
18197,SECT. IX.,"among whom I cannot pretend to rank, to suppose that Ἐφύρη and Φηραὶ"
18198,SECT. IX.,"may be drawn etymologically from the same root. If so, that root will"
18199,SECT. IX.,"be probably the same with that of ἔρα, and of φῆρ of which we have"
18200,SECT. IX.,ascertained that it is related to the Hellic races: and upon these
18201,SECT. IX.,"suppositions we may already be prepared, I do not say to conclude, but"
18202,SECT. IX.,"to suspect that Ἐφύρη and Φεραὶ may properly denote, and may be the"
18203,SECT. IX.,"original and proper Hellic name for the _terre_ (Ital.), or walled"
18204,SECT. IX.,"places, founded by the Hellic races; as Ἄργος signifies the open"
18205,SECT. IX.,"districts in which the Pelasgians were given to settling κωμηδὸν, for"
18206,SECT. IX.,agricultural purposes.
18207,SECT. IX.,
18208,SECT. IX.,I do not mean by this that the Pelasgian settlements contained no
18209,SECT. IX.,"aggregations of houses, or that the Hellic were not connected with the"
18210,SECT. IX.,"cultivation of the soil. On the contrary, as the Pelasgians apparently"
18211,SECT. IX.,"built their Larissas for defence, so we seem to have indications"
18212,SECT. IX.,connecting the name Ephyre with a fertile soil. When Homer represents
18213,SECT. IX.,"the Ἔφυροι as objects of invasion by Mars from Thrace, he probably"
18214,SECT. IX.,"means by the name the inhabitants of a settled country in the plains,"
18215,SECT. IX.,on whom predatory incursions were made by the Thracian highlanders.
18216,SECT. IX.,So that if we shall succeed in shewing a special connection between
18217,SECT. IX.,"the local name Ephyre and the Hellic tribes, we may, by the reflected"
18218,SECT. IX.,"light of that conclusion, even venture to understand the word Ephyri"
18219,SECT. IX.,"as meaning Helli, who had come down into the low country, made"
18220,SECT. IX.,"settlements, and acquired something at least of the habits of civilized"
18221,SECT. IX.,life.
18222,SECT. IX.,
18223,SECT. IX.,"Nor are we without further Homeric evidence to the effect that,"
18224,SECT. IX.,"wherever an Ephyre is found, there is usually an abundance of rich"
18225,SECT. IX.,"pasture and cultivable land, so that the name is well adapted to mark"
18226,SECT. IX.,those spots which a conquering race would be apt to choose for its
18227,SECT. IX.,abodes.
18228,SECT. IX.,
18229,SECT. IX.,"For example, Elis has its Ephyre: and from the fact that Elis was the"
18230,SECT. IX.,"scene of the national chariot-races, we might at once conclude that it"
18231,SECT. IX.,"was famous for its horses, and if so, that it abounded in good soil"
18232,SECT. IX.,"and pasture, and in open country. Wherever in Homer we find the horse"
18233,SECT. IX.,"conspicuous, we find also good lands and opulence, whether it be in"
18234,SECT. IX.,"Troas, in the Thrace called ἐριβώλαξ[855], in Thessaly, or in Elis."
18235,SECT. IX.,"For Homer gives us, as to the last, direct evidence of the fact, by"
18236,SECT. IX.,"his epithets εὐρύχορος, open, and ἱππόβοτος, horse-pasturing[856]."
18237,SECT. IX.,"Elis, in fact, was most probably for Peloponnesus what Bœotia was for"
18238,SECT. IX.,"Middle Greece: the first halting place, from its fertile soil, of those"
18239,SECT. IX.,"who entered the region; the scene, accordingly, of rapid successions,"
18240,SECT. IX.,"and therefore frequent revolutions, but also the place bearing the"
18241,SECT. IX.,"strongest marks, through nomenclature, of the country from which the"
18242,SECT. IX.,new-comers had proceeded.
18243,SECT. IX.,
18244,SECT. IX.,"Again, the Ephyre of the Odyssey is expressly called (Od. ii. 328),"
18245,SECT. IX.,πίειραν ἄρουραν. And when Hercules took Astyoche from Ephyre (Il. ii.
18246,SECT. IX.,"659), after despoiling that with many other cities, we may clearly"
18247,SECT. IX.,"infer, that they were rich, and not poor places which he plundered,"
18248,SECT. IX.,"therefore that this Ephyre also was rich, and if so, rich in its soil,"
18249,SECT. IX.,"the only wealth, for regions, then known to Greece. Again, the Ephyre"
18250,SECT. IX.,"of Sisyphus (Il. vi. 152) became Corinth, and Corinth was even in"
18251,SECT. IX.,Homer’s time called ἄφνειος. This epithet is referred by some to its
18252,SECT. IX.,favourable position for commerce. But such an explanation is wholly
18253,SECT. IX.,unsuited to the age of Homer. For the commercial prominence of Corinth
18254,SECT. IX.,"belongs to a later period; and we have nothing to support the idea,"
18255,SECT. IX.,that commercial opulence existed in Greece at this period at all. The
18256,SECT. IX.,"natural explanation seems to be, the fertility of the soil of the plain"
18257,SECT. IX.,"between the rock of Corinth and Sicyon. This seems to have become, in"
18258,SECT. IX.,"after-time, the subject of a proverb. Hence the χρησμόλογος in the Aves"
18259,SECT. IX.,"of Aristophanes says (Av. 968),"
18260,SECT. IX.,
18261,SECT. IX.,ἀλλ’ ὅταν οἰκήσωσι λύκοι πολιαί τε κορώναι
18262,SECT. IX.,ἐν ταυτῷ τὸ μεταξὺ Κορίνθου καὶ Σικυῶνος.
18263,SECT. IX.,
18264,SECT. IX.,"In the same sense as where Shakespeare says,"
18265,SECT. IX.,
18266,SECT. IX.,When Birnam wood shall move to Dunsinane.
18267,SECT. IX.,
18268,SECT. IX.,"The Scholiast gives two explanations, of which the best is εὔφορος γὰρ"
18269,SECT. IX.,αὕτη ἡ χώρα.
18270,SECT. IX.,
18271,SECT. IX.,"Again, it is certainly confirmatory of the supposition that Ἐφύρη"
18272,SECT. IX.,"was the name of the primitive Hellic, as Ἄργος was of the Pelasgic"
18273,SECT. IX.,"settlement, when we find that the first, though clearly meaning"
18274,SECT. IX.,"a settled place, has etymologically no reference to agricultural"
18275,SECT. IX.,"labour, while the second is entirely based upon that idea; since"
18276,SECT. IX.,"these significations of the word chosen to denote settlement, in the"
18277,SECT. IX.,"two cases agree, in their reciprocal difference, with the different"
18278,SECT. IX.,"specific character of the Hellic and Pelasgic tribes, the former"
18279,SECT. IX.,"emerging from the mountains, predatory and poor, ardent, bold, and"
18280,SECT. IX.,"enterprising; the latter peaceful in their habits, and looking to"
18281,SECT. IX.,nothing beyond the cultivation of the soil.
18282,SECT. IX.,
18283,SECT. IX.,"So much for the root of Ephyre and Pheræ, and for the relation between"
18284,SECT. IX.,the two.
18285,SECT. IX.,
18286,SECT. IX.,_Places bearing the name in Homer._
18287,SECT. IX.,
18288,SECT. IX.,Now the Homeric testimony to the prevalence of these names is exactly
18289,SECT. IX.,such as most effectually establishes the connection between them on the
18290,SECT. IX.,"one hand, and Thessaly with the Hellic races on the other."
18291,SECT. IX.,
18292,SECT. IX.,First as to Ephyre.
18293,SECT. IX.,
18294,SECT. IX.,"1. Five generations before the Trojan war, Sisyphus, a son or"
18295,SECT. IX.,"descendant of Æolus, was settled, apparently as a subordinate prince"
18296,SECT. IX.,"or lord, in an Ephyre, which was near the territory of Prœtus, and"
18297,SECT. IX.,"was situated μύχῳ Ἄργεος ἱπποβότοιο. Bellerophon, the grandson of"
18298,SECT. IX.,"Sisyphus, was driven out by Prœtus, king of the Argives; and was a"
18299,SECT. IX.,"ξεῖνος of Œneus, the ancestor of Diomed. These circumstances, combined"
18300,SECT. IX.,with the tradition that attached the name of Ephyre to the site of
18301,SECT. IX.,"Corinth, leave no doubt that Homer means to place Sisyphus in what was"
18302,SECT. IX.,afterwards Corinth[857]. There was no other known Ephyre in a nook of
18303,SECT. IX.,"Ἄργος, or what may be termed within reach of Prœtus and Œneus: whereas"
18304,SECT. IX.,this Ephyre lay upon the pass that communicated with the North from
18305,SECT. IX.,that part of the Peloponnesus.
18306,SECT. IX.,
18307,SECT. IX.,But the line of Sisyphus had been displaced in the person of
18308,SECT. IX.,"Bellerophon, two generations before the Trojan war. Together with this"
18309,SECT. IX.,line the old name of Ephyre had disappeared: we hear of it in the Iliad
18310,SECT. IX.,"only as Corinth, and as part of the Mycenian dominions. Now tradition"
18311,SECT. IX.,"connects the Æolid title particularly with Thessaly, the Æolids always"
18312,SECT. IX.,having been recognised as one of the great primitive Greek races. And
18313,SECT. IX.,"Homer gives us Æolids in Thessaly, as well as in Peloponnesus. In the"
18314,SECT. IX.,"time of Sisyphus then we see this Æolid name, which is Eteo-Hellenic,"
18315,SECT. IX.,"conjoined with the local name Ephyre: at the epoch of the Trojan war,"
18316,SECT. IX.,both have disappeared from the spot.
18317,SECT. IX.,
18318,SECT. IX.,"The traditional name Ephyre remained, indeed, in many parts of Greece"
18319,SECT. IX.,"down to later times. Strabo (p. 338) reckons one in Elis, one in"
18320,SECT. IX.,"Thesprotia, and one in Thessaly, besides Corinth: and also five κωμαὶ"
18321,SECT. IX.,"of the name. But even in Homer’s time, either these settlements had"
18322,SECT. IX.,"decayed, or else, which is more likely, the particular form Ἐφύρη had"
18323,SECT. IX.,"never acquired the precise force of a proper name, but remained rather"
18324,SECT. IX.,in the category of a descriptive word: for otherwise it could hardly
18325,SECT. IX.,"have happened, but that one or other of the Ephyres must have been"
18326,SECT. IX.,"named in the Catalogue of Homer. If a descriptive word, it was in all"
18327,SECT. IX.,likelihood simply descriptive of primitive settlement for the Hellic
18328,SECT. IX.,"race. Probably these Ἐφύραι were rude and small; and were, properly"
18329,SECT. IX.,"speaking, collections of a few buildings, rather than cities regularly"
18330,SECT. IX.,formed.
18331,SECT. IX.,
18332,SECT. IX.,"2. That passage of the Thirteenth Iliad has already been mentioned,"
18333,SECT. IX.,"which places this name in the North. The Poet says, speaking of Mars"
18334,SECT. IX.,"and his son Φόβος,"
18335,SECT. IX.,
18336,SECT. IX.,"τὼ μὲν ἄρ’ ἐκ Θρῄκης Ἐφύρους μέτα θωρήσσεσθον,"
18337,SECT. IX.,ἠὲ μετὰ Φλέγυας μεγαλήτορας[858].
18338,SECT. IX.,
18339,SECT. IX.,Two circumstances warrant our placing these Ἔφυροι in Thessaly: the
18340,SECT. IX.,"first, that the name of Thrace does not extend farther southward: and"
18341,SECT. IX.,"the second, that here is the only known seat of the Phlegyæ."
18342,SECT. IX.,
18343,SECT. IX.,"3. It may be convenient next to take the Ephyre, which is mentioned"
18344,SECT. IX.,twice in the Odyssey.
18345,SECT. IX.,
18346,SECT. IX.,"In the first of these passages Pallas, in the character of Mentes, Lord"
18347,SECT. IX.,"of the Taphians, remembers Ulysses in the days when he undertook other"
18348,SECT. IX.,"journeys before his Trojan one: remembers him,"
18349,SECT. IX.,
18350,SECT. IX.,ἐξ Ἐφύρης ἀνίοντα παρ’ Ἴλου Μερμερίδαο.
18351,SECT. IX.,ᾤχετο γὰρ καὶ κεῖσε θοῆς ἐπὶ νηὸς Ὀδυσσεὺς
18352,SECT. IX.,φάρμακον ἀνδροφόνον διζήμενος[859].
18353,SECT. IX.,
18354,SECT. IX.,"And again, when the Suitors apprehend that Telemachus meditates"
18355,SECT. IX.,"mischief, they ask whether he will bring allies from Pylus, or even"
18356,SECT. IX.,from Sparta (which was more remote).
18357,SECT. IX.,
18358,SECT. IX.,ἤ τινας ἐκ Πύλου ἄξει ἀμύντορας ἠμαθόεντος
18359,SECT. IX.,"ἢ ὅγε καὶ Σπάρτηθεν, ἐπεί νύ περ ἵεται αἰνῶς·"

18361,SECT. IX.,"ἐλθεῖν, ὄφρ’ ἔνθεν θυμοφθόρα φάρμακ’ ἐνείκῃ[860]."
18362,SECT. IX.,
18363,SECT. IX.,For several reasons it appears probable that the Ephyre here meant was
18364,SECT. IX.,"in Elis, and was therefore the Ephyre of Augeias."
18365,SECT. IX.,
18366,SECT. IX.,1. Geographically it would appear likely to be in the Peloponnesus.
18367,SECT. IX.,Telemachus was little likely to make any more extended voyage. The
18368,SECT. IX.,"intercourse of his family was generally with the Iasian Argos, or"
18369,SECT. IX.,"Western Peloponnesus. Hence it is said of Penelope[861], ‘Could all"
18370,SECT. IX.,"the Achæans of Iasian Argos see thee.’ And hence, in the Twenty-fourth"
18371,SECT. IX.,"Odyssey[862], the enemies of Ulysses anticipate that, unless prevented"
18372,SECT. IX.,"by them, he will resort either to Pylus or to Elis, where are the"
18373,SECT. IX.,"Epeans, for assistance. Hence, again, it is that, in the Second"
18374,SECT. IX.,"Odyssey, we find Ephyre joined with Pylus and Sparta (which last is"
18375,SECT. IX.,"mentioned as an extreme point, ἢ ὅγε καὶ Σπάρτηθεν,) as the quarters"
18376,SECT. IX.,to which he might repair for aid. The names of Elis and the Epeans do
18377,SECT. IX.,not appear: and this of itself amounts nearly to a demonstration that
18378,SECT. IX.,"Ephyre not only lay in, but actually stands in lieu of, Elis in this"
18379,SECT. IX.,place.
18380,SECT. IX.,
18381,SECT. IX.,We may however note one or two secondary points.
18382,SECT. IX.,
18383,SECT. IX.,"2. Corinth had now lost the name of Ephyre, that is to say, a new name"
18384,SECT. IX.,"had overshadowed the old one. But this Ephyre, if not Corinth, could"
18385,SECT. IX.,only be the Elian Ephyre.
18386,SECT. IX.,
18387,SECT. IX.,3. Post-Homeric tradition places an Ephyre in Elis.
18388,SECT. IX.,
18389,SECT. IX.,"We have already seen that Augeias was lord of Elis, that he ruled over"
18390,SECT. IX.,"an Hellenic race, that he is an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν: was this Ephyre the seat"
18391,SECT. IX.,of his empire?
18392,SECT. IX.,
18393,SECT. IX.,"Even from the bare fact of being in Elis, it stands in significant"
18394,SECT. IX.,"connection with Augeias: but more especially, it seems impossible not"
18395,SECT. IX.,"to connect the peculiar knowledge of drugs, preserved at the Ephyre to"
18396,SECT. IX.,"which Ulysses repaired, with the former fame of Agamede, the daughter"
18397,SECT. IX.,"of Augeias (Il. xi. 740), from whom it had, in all probability, been"
18398,SECT. IX.,handed down to the next following generation.
18399,SECT. IX.,
18400,SECT. IX.,"It may be asked, what place had Ilus, the son of Mermerus[863], in"
18401,SECT. IX.,"an Ephyre, where Augeias had been king or lord? We can give at least"
18402,SECT. IX.,"this negative answer: the Catalogue shews that Elis, in the time of"
18403,SECT. IX.,"the Trojan war, was no longer patriarchally ruled; for the Epeans had"
18404,SECT. IX.,four coordinate leaders; of whom the grandson of Augeias was but one.
18405,SECT. IX.,Therefore an Ilus may have been in the time of Ulysses possessed of
18406,SECT. IX.,"the place, which belonged to Augeias in Nestor’s boyhood: and we may"
18407,SECT. IX.,"observe, that no Epean or Elian chief, contemporary with the _Troica_,"
18408,SECT. IX.,appears in Homer under the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.
18409,SECT. IX.,
18410,SECT. IX.,"Upon combining all these circumstances, we appear to have the strongest"
18411,SECT. IX.,warrant for believing that Augeias was lord of Ephyre; that he was the
18412,SECT. IX.,head of one of the ruling families which derived themselves by a known
18413,SECT. IX.,and recorded lineage from Hellas and a Hellic tribe; and consequently
18414,SECT. IX.,"that the archaic title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν was applied to him, not casually,"
18415,SECT. IX.,"but with a definite meaning, and in conformity to an established rule."
18416,SECT. IX.,
18417,SECT. IX.,_Summary of the evidence for Augeias._
18418,SECT. IX.,
18419,SECT. IX.,"The following brief synopsis will, after what has been said, serve to"
18420,SECT. IX.,indicate the chief presumptive grounds of the title of Augeias to ἄναξ
18421,SECT. IX.,ἀνδρῶν.
18422,SECT. IX.,
18423,SECT. IX.,"1. Augeias is connected with the φάρμακα, Il. xi. 739-41."
18424,SECT. IX.,
18425,SECT. IX.,"2. The φάρμακα with Ephyre, Od. i. 259."
18426,SECT. IX.,
18427,SECT. IX.,"3. Ephyre with Sisyphus, Il. vi. 152, 3."
18428,SECT. IX.,
18429,SECT. IX.,"4. Sisyphus is the son of Æolus, Il. vi. 154."
18430,SECT. IX.,
18431,SECT. IX.,"5. Æolus is Eteo-Hellenic, as the common ancestor of several of the"
18432,SECT. IX.,"great Greek houses, and the lineal ancestor of at least one ἄναξ"
18433,SECT. IX.,ἀνδρῶν[864].
18434,SECT. IX.,
18435,SECT. IX.,"6. Æolus is also of divine descent, for his descendant Bellerophon is"
18436,SECT. IX.,"θεοῦ γόνος, Il. vi. 191."
18437,SECT. IX.,
18438,SECT. IX.,"7. That is to say, he is a son of Jupiter; for θεὸς commonly means"
18439,SECT. IX.,"Jupiter, when there is no particular reference to any other deity in"
18440,SECT. IX.,"the context, and when a personal act or attribute is described."
18441,SECT. IX.,
18442,SECT. IX.,"The extra-Homeric tradition entirely supports this belief, for it makes"
18443,SECT. IX.,"Augeias the son of Salmoneus, and Salmoneus the son of Æolus."
18444,SECT. IX.,
18445,SECT. IX.,"And now, after we have considered so fully the term Ἐφύρη and its"
18446,SECT. IX.,"kindred words, we shall do well to notice that at least the dominions"
18447,SECT. IX.,of Agamemnon are not void of some relation to this family of names;
18448,SECT. IX.,"inasmuch as Φᾶρις, in the Catalogue, is one of the towns that provide"
18449,SECT. IX.,"his forces, and Φῆραι, in the Ninth Iliad, is one of the towns of which"
18450,SECT. IX.,he promises to make Achilles lord. Of Phellias and Sellasia we have
18451,SECT. IX.,already treated.
18452,SECT. IX.,
18453,SECT. IX.,
18454,SECT. IX.,V. _Case of Euphetes._
18455,SECT. IX.,
18456,SECT. IX.,I proceed to the case of Euphetes.
18457,SECT. IX.,
18458,SECT. IX.,"He is mentioned only once in the Homeric Poems. It is when, in the"
18459,SECT. IX.,"Fifteenth Iliad, Dolops strikes at Meges, son of Phyleus, who is saved"
18460,SECT. IX.,"by his stout breastplate: by that breastplate,"
18461,SECT. IX.,
18462,SECT. IX.,τόν ποτε Φύλευς
18463,SECT. IX.,"ἤγαγεν ἐξ Ἐφύρης, ποταμοῦ ἀπὸ Σελλήεντος."
18464,SECT. IX.,ξεῖνος γάρ οἱ ἔδωκεν ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Εὐφήτης[865].
18465,SECT. IX.,
18466,SECT. IX.,"This case, as it stands, is very simple. Euphetes is manifestly the"
18467,SECT. IX.,king of Ephyre: the name of the place supplies the connection with the
18468,SECT. IX.,cradle of the Hellenes; the link is doubled by the name of the river
18469,SECT. IX.,"Σελληείς, and his rank presumably stamps him as of a ruling race in the"
18470,SECT. IX.,"country; for he is a ξεῖνος to a sovereign, and the xenial relation"
18471,SECT. IX.,"appears to have been always one between persons equal, or nearly so."
18472,SECT. IX.,
18473,SECT. IX.,"The passage, however, affords us no aid towards determining where this"
18474,SECT. IX.,Ephyre lay; for it does not tell us where to look for the residence of
18475,SECT. IX.,Phyleus.
18476,SECT. IX.,
18477,SECT. IX.,"Was it the Ephyre of Elis, or was it another Ephyre, mentioned in a"
18478,SECT. IX.,passage that we have not yet examined? To this passage let us now turn.
18479,SECT. IX.,
18480,SECT. IX.,"In the Greek Catalogue, Tlepolemus, the son of Hercules, commands nine"
18481,SECT. IX.,"ships from Rhodes, whither he had migrated, on account of having slain"
18482,SECT. IX.,"his grand uncle Licymnius. His birth is described as follows,--"
18483,SECT. IX.,
18484,SECT. IX.,ὃν τέκεν Ἀστυόχεια βίῃ Ἡρακληείῃ·
18485,SECT. IX.,"τὴν ἄγετ’ ἐξ Ἐφύρης, ποταμοῦ ἀπὸ Σελληέντος,"
18486,SECT. IX.,πέρσας ἄστεα πολλὰ Διοτρεφέων αἰζηῶν[866].
18487,SECT. IX.,
18488,SECT. IX.,"Hercules then led off Astyocheia from Ephyre beside Selleeis, after"
18489,SECT. IX.,having devastated many cities. The opinion may perhaps be sustained
18490,SECT. IX.,"from this passage, that the Ephyre mentioned in it is not the Ephyre of"
18491,SECT. IX.,"Elis, for the following reasons."
18492,SECT. IX.,
18493,SECT. IX.,1. Tlepolemus[867] emigrates to Rhodes in consequence of homicide. He
18494,SECT. IX.,"is more likely to have done this from Thessaly than Elis, for we see no"
18495,SECT. IX.,signs of communication between western Peloponnesus and the islands of
18496,SECT. IX.,Asia Minor near the base of the Ægean.
18497,SECT. IX.,
18498,SECT. IX.,"2. If Astyocheia, the mother of Tlepolemus, was also the Astyoche who"
18499,SECT. IX.,"bore to Mars Ascalaphus and Ialmenus (Il. ii. 513), then he was more"
18500,SECT. IX.,"likely to be Thessalian than Elian; for Mars, dwelling in Thrace,"
18501,SECT. IX.,"bordered upon Thessaly, but is not heard of in Southern Greece; and"
18502,SECT. IX.,"these princes ruled over the Minyeian Orchomenus, which is far from the"
18503,SECT. IX.,"Peloponnesus, but near Southern Thessaly."
18504,SECT. IX.,
18505,SECT. IX.,"3. Again, Nestor, in the Eleventh Book[868], where he sets forth the"
18506,SECT. IX.,"depression into which the Pylians had fallen, through the depredations"
18507,SECT. IX.,"of their neighbours the Elians, states that they had been unable"
18508,SECT. IX.,"to defend themselves against those ravages, because Hercules had"
18509,SECT. IX.,devastated their country and slain their princes. Now he would hardly
18510,SECT. IX.,"have said this, if the Elian Ephyre and its neighbourhood had likewise"
18511,SECT. IX.,"been devastated by Hercules, since his account would then have failed"
18512,SECT. IX.,to explain the relative inferiority of the Pylians. But if it was
18513,SECT. IX.,"not the Elian Ephyre, and since the situation of the Isthmus and its"
18514,SECT. IX.,"state make the passage inapplicable to the Corinthian Ephyre, then,"
18515,SECT. IX.,still looking for some country known in connection with the exploits
18516,SECT. IX.,"of Hercules, we must naturally take it to be the Ephyre of Thessaly,"
18517,SECT. IX.,"where the name Selleeis, as that of a neighbouring stream, would most"
18518,SECT. IX.,naturally of all be looked for.
18519,SECT. IX.,
18520,SECT. IX.,It is true that the geographers give us no record of a river Selleeis
18521,SECT. IX.,near the Thessalian Ephyre. But the fugitive character of the name
18522,SECT. IX.,"Ephyre is manifest from the fact that, though there were several"
18523,SECT. IX.,"Ephyres in Homer’s time, none of them was of sufficient importance to"
18524,SECT. IX.,furnish a military contingent worth naming. If by Ephyre was meant
18525,SECT. IX.,"the first site of a new colony, that name might naturally disappear,"
18526,SECT. IX.,"not only with a removal to a more secure or convenient spot, but"
18527,SECT. IX.,even perhaps on the growth of a mere group of inclosed buildings
18528,SECT. IX.,into a walled town. It is therefore no wonder if the site of many of
18529,SECT. IX.,"these towns has been forgotten, or if the neighbouring streams in"
18530,SECT. IX.,consequence cannot be identified.
18531,SECT. IX.,
18532,SECT. IX.,_The site of his Ephyre._
18533,SECT. IX.,
18534,SECT. IX.,"There is a tradition, external to Homer, but not at variance with him,"
18535,SECT. IX.,that the Astyocheia whom Hercules carried off was the daughter of
18536,SECT. IX.,"Phylas; and if so, Phylas was of course lord of the Ephyre, from which"
18537,SECT. IX.,"she was carried off. If we assume the veracity of this tradition, we"
18538,SECT. IX.,can determine the seat of the Ephyre of Astyocheia to have been in
18539,SECT. IX.,Thessaly. For the five commanders under Achilles were of course all
18540,SECT. IX.,"drawn from that country. But among them is Eudorus, the son of Polymele"
18541,SECT. IX.,and grandson of Phylas[869].
18542,SECT. IX.,
18543,SECT. IX.,"It may here be asked, by the way, why is not this Eudorus an ἄναξ"
18544,SECT. IX.,ἀνδρῶν? even his name is of the form to which the phrase is so well
18545,SECT. IX.,"suited. The answer is that, though he was the son of Polymele, and the"
18546,SECT. IX.,"grandson of Phylas on the female side, his reputed father was Mercury,"
18547,SECT. IX.,"and he was therefore not descended in the male line from, and could not"
18548,SECT. IX.,"be called, the chieftain of a tribe."
18549,SECT. IX.,
18550,SECT. IX.,"If then Phylas was lord of the Thessalian Ephyre, and Euphetes was also"
18551,SECT. IX.,"lord of the Thessalian Ephyre, in what relation to one another are we"
18552,SECT. IX.,to presume them to have stood as to time? There is here no appearance
18553,SECT. IX.,"of discrepancy. Phyleus, as the father of Meges, was the ξεῖνος of"
18554,SECT. IX.,"Euphetes one generation before the Trojan war. Tlepolemus, contemporary"
18555,SECT. IX.,"of Meges, was by our supposition the grandson of Phylas. Phylas, lord"
18556,SECT. IX.,"of Ephyre, was therefore probably one generation earlier than Euphetes,"
18557,SECT. IX.,and may have been his father.
18558,SECT. IX.,
18559,SECT. IX.,"Nor is it an objection to this reasoning, that Meges, son of Phyleus,"
18560,SECT. IX.,"was lord of Dulichium, and that we cannot suppose Phyleus to have been"
18561,SECT. IX.,the ξεῖνος of one dwelling so far off as the Thessalian Ephyre. For
18562,SECT. IX.,"first, Nestor the Pylian had fought in Thessaly. And next, Meges had"
18563,SECT. IX.,been a fugitive from his father’s dwelling on account of a feud with
18564,SECT. IX.,"him: which makes it even probable that he would remove to a distance,"
18565,SECT. IX.,"as we see that Tlepolemus went on a similar account from Thessaly, or"
18566,SECT. IX.,"at least from some part of Greece, to Rhodes."
18567,SECT. IX.,
18568,SECT. IX.,"If then Euphetes, who was an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, governed an Ephyre, and"
18569,SECT. IX.,"particularly if it was in Thessaly, the special seat of the Helli, we"
18570,SECT. IX.,can have little difficulty in concluding that he bore the title as a
18571,SECT. IX.,"patriarchal one, in right of his descent."
18572,SECT. IX.,
18573,SECT. IX.,"On the other hand, the Ephyre of Tlepolemus is certainly in the"
18574,SECT. IX.,general opinion presumed to be the Ephyre of Elis. If this opinion be
18575,SECT. IX.,"correct, it is still more easy to connect him with the title of ἄναξ"
18576,SECT. IX.,"ἀνδρῶν. Augeias lives two generations before the Trojan war, rules in"
18577,SECT. IX.,"Ephyre, and is ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Euphetes is contemporary with the father of"
18578,SECT. IX.,"Meges, who fights in the war; and he is therefore one generation after"
18579,SECT. IX.,"Augeias, while he rules in the same place, and bears the same title. If"
18580,SECT. IX.,"then the Ephyre of Euphetes was Elian, it seems impossible to escape"
18581,SECT. IX.,the presumption that Euphetes was the son of Augeias.
18582,SECT. IX.,
18583,SECT. IX.,This view as to the Ephyre of Euphetes on the whole will more
18584,SECT. IX.,completely satisfy the Homeric text. For we find Meges in the
18585,SECT. IX.,Thirteenth Book fighting at the head of Epean troops[870]. But the
18586,SECT. IX.,troops he led to Troy were from Dulichium and the Echinades[871]. So we
18587,SECT. IX.,can only conclude one of two things. Either Meges commanded the Epeans
18588,SECT. IX.,of Elis in virtue of the connection of his family with that country;
18589,SECT. IX.,"or he commanded Epeans, whom his father Phyleus had taken with him from"
18590,SECT. IX.,Elis across the Corinthian gulf. Either way a relation between Elis and
18591,SECT. IX.,"the family of Meges is made good, which tends to place Euphetes, as the"
18592,SECT. IX.,"friend of that family, in the Ephyre of Elis."
18593,SECT. IX.,
18594,SECT. IX.,There is yet another supposition open. Homer has told us that Phyleus
18595,SECT. IX.,"was Διὶ φίλος,--a distinction he very rarely confers,--and that he"
18596,SECT. IX.,"migrated, as he implies rather than asserts, from Elis, on account of a"
18597,SECT. IX.,quarrel with his father:
18598,SECT. IX.,
18599,SECT. IX.,ὃς πότε Δουλίχιόν δ’ ἀπενάσσατο πατρὶ χολωθείς.
18600,SECT. IX.,
18601,SECT. IX.,He does not mention the cause; but this abrupt allusion to the father
18602,SECT. IX.,of Phyleus implies that he was a person of note. Strabo[872] may
18603,SECT. IX.,"therefore only be filling up a void in Homer, when he tells us, of"
18604,SECT. IX.,"course from some tradition, that Augeias was the father of Phyleus."
18605,SECT. IX.,
18606,SECT. IX.,"If this were so, we have to ask, why is not Phyleus an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν? and"
18607,SECT. IX.,"who, upon this supposition, could Euphetes be?"
18608,SECT. IX.,
18609,SECT. IX.,As we must infer from the Catalogue that the Elian kingdom of Augeias
18610,SECT. IX.,"was broken up at the epoch of the _Troica_, and as in consequence we do"
18611,SECT. IX.,"not find Polyxeinus, his grandson, called by the title in question, so"
18612,SECT. IX.,neither need we expect it of Phyleus.
18613,SECT. IX.,
18614,SECT. IX.,"If Phyleus was the son of Augeias, Euphetes cannot have been sovereign"
18615,SECT. IX.,"of the Elian Ephyre, for they would in this case not have been ξεῖνοι,"
18616,SECT. IX.,but brothers.
18617,SECT. IX.,
18618,SECT. IX.,But he might still have been sovereign either of the Ephyre mentioned
18619,SECT. IX.,"by Homer, μυχῷ Ἄργεος, which appears as Corinth in the Catalogue: or"
18620,SECT. IX.,possibly of the Thesprotian Ephyre with which we become acquainted in
18621,SECT. IX.,Strabo.
18622,SECT. IX.,
18623,SECT. IX.,"If Euphetes represented, with the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, one of the old"
18624,SECT. IX.,"Hellic chieftaincies at either of those places, nothing could be more"
18625,SECT. IX.,natural than that the tie of hostship should subsist between him and
18626,SECT. IX.,"Phyleus, the son of another Hellic chieftain of the same class."
18627,SECT. IX.,
18628,SECT. IX.,"In any case, though the Homeric evidence is palpably incomplete, yet"
18629,SECT. IX.,by connecting the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν with the highly characteristic
18630,SECT. IX.,"local title of Ephyre, and the name of the river Selleeis, it"
18631,SECT. IX.,unequivocally supports the interpretation of that title as one
18632,SECT. IX.,indicating an original and purely Hellic chieftaincy.
18633,SECT. IX.,
18634,SECT. IX.,
18635,SECT. IX.,VI. _Case of Eumelus._
18636,SECT. IX.,
18637,SECT. IX.,"It now only remains to consider the case of Eumelus, the last of the"
18638,SECT. IX.,six persons to whom Homer gives the peculiar title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.
18639,SECT. IX.,
18640,SECT. IX.,He is introduced to us in the Catalogue as the φίλος παῖς[873] (φίλος
18641,SECT. IX.,"meaning probably either the eldest or only son) of Admetus, who is"
18642,SECT. IX.,"never mentioned except in the oblique cases, and to whom therefore,"
18643,SECT. IX.,"consistently with his usage, Homer never applies the title ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν."
18644,SECT. IX.,"He is in command of his father’s forces; and, as Pheræ is the city"
18645,SECT. IX.,"first named in this list, we may infer that this was his principal city."
18646,SECT. IX.,
18647,SECT. IX.,"In the first place I would remark, that we have for this Pheræ a sign"
18648,SECT. IX.,"of wealth, which has been already noticed, the excellence, namely, of"
18649,SECT. IX.,its breed of horses. There is also abundant evidence of the wealth and
18650,SECT. IX.,importance of Pheræ in the historic times[874]. This mark then accords
18651,SECT. IX.,"with the hypothesis, that it was probably one of the primitive lowland"
18652,SECT. IX.,"settlements made by the Hellic race in Thessaly. In fact, Pheræ stands"
18653,SECT. IX.,"relatively to Admetus, as Ephyre does relatively to Augeias, Euphetes,"
18654,SECT. IX.,"and the older Æolid, Sisyphus."
18655,SECT. IX.,
18656,SECT. IX.,"Through the medium of the name Pheræ we connect this family with Ἐφύρη,"
18657,SECT. IX.,"as its cognate name, and as the name which we have found, in the cases"
18658,SECT. IX.,"of Euphetes and Augeias, to be eminently characteristic of settlements"
18659,SECT. IX.,under an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.
18660,SECT. IX.,
18661,SECT. IX.,"Next it appears, that the father or ancestor of Admetus took his name"
18662,SECT. IX.,"from the place which he inhabited, and was called Pheres, for says the"
18663,SECT. IX.,"poet,"
18664,SECT. IX.,
18665,SECT. IX.,"Ἵπποι μὲν μέγ’ ἄρισται ἔσαν Φηρητιάδαο,"
18666,SECT. IX.,τὰς Εὔμηλος ἔλαυνε[875].
18667,SECT. IX.,
18668,SECT. IX.,The union between the names of the place and the person affords another
18669,SECT. IX.,sign of primitive settlement. Pheres was probably the founder of the
18670,SECT. IX.,town Φηραί.
18671,SECT. IX.,
18672,SECT. IX.,"Next, a passage in the Odyssey gives us an account of this Pheres[876]."
18673,SECT. IX.,"He was the son of Cretheus, by Tyro:"
18674,SECT. IX.,
18675,SECT. IX.,"τοὺς δ’ ἑτέρους Κρηθῆϊ τέκεν βασίλεια γυναικῶν,"
18676,SECT. IX.,Αἴσονά τ’ ἠδὲ Φέρητ’ Ἀμυθάονα τ’ ἱππιοχάρμην.
18677,SECT. IX.,
18678,SECT. IX.,Now Cretheus was a son or descendant of Æolus:
18679,SECT. IX.,
18680,SECT. IX.,Φῆ δὲ Κρηθῆος γυνὴ ἔμμεναι Αἰολίδαο[877].
18681,SECT. IX.,
18682,SECT. IX.,And we have already seen the Æolids of Homer directly connected with
18683,SECT. IX.,the characteristic name of Ephyre in the person of Sisyphus (Il. vi.
18684,SECT. IX.,"152, 211). Outside the Homeric text, all tradition ascribes to the"
18685,SECT. IX.,"Æolians, not less than the Achæans, an Eteo-Hellenic origin. Again, we"
18686,SECT. IX.,"may observe, that among the Greek genealogies of Homer, the longest are"
18687,SECT. IX.,"those of the Æolids. From Æolus to Glaucus II, in the Sixth Iliad, are"
18688,SECT. IX.,six generations: and here in like manner from Cretheus to Eumelus are
18689,SECT. IX.,"four, which number will be increased to five or to six, according as"
18690,SECT. IX.,"we take Cretheus to be the son or the grandson of Æolus, or estimate"
18691,SECT. IX.,"the age of Eumelus. According to the Homeric force of the patronymic,"
18692,SECT. IX.,"he may be either. Eumelus, however, himself was, as we have seen,"
18693,SECT. IX.,presumably not young at the time of the _Troica_; since he was wedded
18694,SECT. IX.,"to Iphthime, the sister of Penelope, who must be taken to stand, with"
18695,SECT. IX.,"her husband Ulysses (Il. xxiii. 791), as above the average age of the"
18696,SECT. IX.,army.
18697,SECT. IX.,
18698,SECT. IX.,"To sum up; it thus far appears,"
18699,SECT. IX.,
18700,SECT. IX.,"1. That Eumelus was heir to Admetus, a reigning prince of Thessaly or"
18701,SECT. IX.,Hellas.
18702,SECT. IX.,
18703,SECT. IX.,2. That the capital of this prince bore testimony by its name to its
18704,SECT. IX.,primitive or Eteo-Hellenic character.
18705,SECT. IX.,
18706,SECT. IX.,"3. That Eumelus was a descendant in the male line from Æolus, of"
18707,SECT. IX.,"whose lineage several, according to Homer, seem to have possessed the"
18708,SECT. IX.,character and borne the title of the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.
18709,SECT. IX.,
18710,SECT. IX.,"4. In virtue of his descent from Æolus, he is sprung from Jupiter."
18711,SECT. IX.,
18712,SECT. IX.,"To estimate fully the force of the evidence, it may be well to observe,"
18713,SECT. IX.,that a great many Thessalian princes and leaders are noticed in the
18714,SECT. IX.,"Catalogue besides Eumelus; to the last alone, however, the title of"
18715,SECT. IX.,"ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν is applied. But no one of the others bears any mark,"
18716,SECT. IX.,"personal or local, of the peculiar descent and social position to which"
18717,SECT. IX.,this title appears to belong: although among them are found Podaleirius
18718,SECT. IX.,"and Machaon, the sons of Asclepius; Polypœtes, the son of Pirithous,"
18719,SECT. IX.,"and grandson of Jupiter; Eurypylus, the distinguished warrior;"
18720,SECT. IX.,"Protesilaus and Philoctetes, each the subject of distinct historical"
18721,SECT. IX.,notices.
18722,SECT. IX.,
18723,SECT. IX.,"Again, I would, from the case of Eumelus, illustrate the phrase ἄναξ"
18724,SECT. IX.,ἀνδρῶν in another point of view.
18725,SECT. IX.,
18726,SECT. IX.,He was descended by his mother Alcestis from Neptune. She was the
18727,SECT. IX.,"daughter of Pelias, the son whom Tyro bore to the fabled ruler of the"
18728,SECT. IX.,"seas. This descent on the mother’s side is mentioned in the Catalogue,"
18729,SECT. IX.,where a total silence is observed as to his paternal lineage from Æolus
18730,SECT. IX.,and Cretheus.
18731,SECT. IX.,
18732,SECT. IX.,"Εὔμηλος, τὸν ὑπ’ Ἀδμήτῳ τέκε δῖα γυναικῶν,"
18733,SECT. IX.,"Ἄλκηστις, Πελίαο θυγατρῶν εἶδος ἀρίστη."
18734,SECT. IX.,
18735,SECT. IX.,But it is plain that his descent from Jupiter by the father’s side was
18736,SECT. IX.,more worthy of notice than his descent from Neptune through the bastard
18737,SECT. IX.,"Pelias. Yet Homer has nowhere taken notice of the descent from Jupiter,"
18738,SECT. IX.,"in the case of Eumelus, unless it is implied in the meaning of the term"
18739,SECT. IX.,"ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, though we know the descent as a fact: surely a strong"
18740,SECT. IX.,"proof that it is part of the meaning of the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, and is"
18741,SECT. IX.,"a thing not only inseparable from it, but conveyed by it."
18742,SECT. IX.,
18743,SECT. IX.,_The ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν descended from Jupiter._
18744,SECT. IX.,
18745,SECT. IX.,With regard to the divine descent of the Homeric chieftains bearing
18746,SECT. IX.,"this title, our direct evidence from the Poet stands as follows:"
18747,SECT. IX.,
18748,SECT. IX.,1. That the Dardan line springs originally from Jupiter.
18749,SECT. IX.,
18750,SECT. IX.,"2. That Tyro, being called εὐπατέρεια in common with Helen only, is"
18751,SECT. IX.,evidently meant to be described as sprung from that deity.
18752,SECT. IX.,
18753,SECT. IX.,"3. That Bellerophon, also an Æolid, is also θεοῦ γόνος, therefore"
18754,SECT. IX.,himself a descendant of Jupiter.
18755,SECT. IX.,
18756,SECT. IX.,"4. And if so, then Eumelus, who was Æolid too, falls within the same"
18757,SECT. IX.,description.
18758,SECT. IX.,
18759,SECT. IX.,5. Augeias in like manner attains to the same honour by the Homeric
18760,SECT. IX.,"presumptions which make him an Æolid, as well as by all extra-Homeric"
18761,SECT. IX.,tradition.
18762,SECT. IX.,
18763,SECT. IX.,"6. With regard to Euphetes and Agamemnon, we have no direct evidence."
18764,SECT. IX.,"But we have seen strong reason to suppose, that Euphetes was himself an"
18765,SECT. IX.,Æolid: and no inconsiderable presumption that Tantalus was according to
18766,SECT. IX.,"Homer what the later tradition makes him, a son of Jupiter, and that"
18767,SECT. IX.,Agamemnon was descended from Tantalus.
18768,SECT. IX.,
18769,SECT. IX.,"Perhaps also, without venturing to attach any conclusive weight to"
18770,SECT. IX.,"such a sign, we may interpret the annexation of Διοτρεφὴς and Διογενὴς"
18771,SECT. IX.,"to Hellic kingship, as a sign that the earliest Hellic kingship,"
18772,SECT. IX.,"being also that which conveyed the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, was always"
18773,SECT. IX.,associated with divine descent.
18774,SECT. IX.,
18775,SECT. IX.,"Among those who bear the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, we find no case of a"
18776,SECT. IX.,descent from Jupiter reputed to be recent. The two lines in which the
18777,SECT. IX.,"title is most clearly transmitted, those of Æolus and of Dardanus, are"
18778,SECT. IX.,"among the oldest genealogies in Homer. That of Agamemnon, apparently"
18779,SECT. IX.,"the shortest, interposes at the least four generations between Jupiter"
18780,SECT. IX.,and him.
18781,SECT. IX.,
18782,SECT. IX.,The line of Dardanus is apparently by one generation longer than any
18783,SECT. IX.,of the others belonging to an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. But nothing can be more
18784,SECT. IX.,"natural: for any settlement, made by the Helli on the Hellespont during"
18785,SECT. IX.,"their eastward movement, would naturally precede by some time their"
18786,SECT. IX.,descent from Olympus and the Thracian hills into Thessaly; so that the
18787,SECT. IX.,"earlier date of the primary ancestor is a witness for, rather than"
18788,SECT. IX.,against the relationship.
18789,SECT. IX.,
18790,SECT. IX.,"It cannot, however, be too carefully borne in mind, that the divine"
18791,SECT. IX.,descent of the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν from Jupiter is widely different from that
18792,SECT. IX.,"of the more recent heroes, like Sarpedon or Hercules. We may suppose"
18793,SECT. IX.,that in such cases as these the divine parent either screens the
18794,SECT. IX.,"result of unlawful love, or perhaps indicates the sudden rise into"
18795,SECT. IX.,eminence of a family previously obscure: with the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν the case
18796,SECT. IX.,"is quite distinct. The poetical meaning here is, that backward there"
18797,SECT. IX.,lay nothing of family history beyond the ancestor from whom he claimed
18798,SECT. IX.,"descent, whether it were Dardanus, or Æolus, or Tantalus: as if aiming"
18799,SECT. IX.,at the effect legitimately produced by those words in the Gospel of
18800,SECT. IX.,"St. Luke, with which the upward line of the genealogy given by him"
18801,SECT. IX.,"closes; ‘which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God[878].’"
18802,SECT. IX.,"And the historic basis of the allegory may probably be this, that the"
18803,SECT. IX.,"person indicated was one of some ruling house, who, with his followers"
18804,SECT. IX.,"or kindred, separated from the migratory race of Helli as it swept"
18805,SECT. IX.,"westward along the hills, and founded a stable settlement, and a"
18806,SECT. IX.,"society more or less organized in orders and employments, in which his"
18807,SECT. IX.,"name became the symbol at once of sovereign rank, of the national point"
18808,SECT. IX.,"of origin, and of affinity in blood with a ruling race."
18809,SECT. IX.,
18810,SECT. IX.,_Four notes of the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν._
18811,SECT. IX.,
18812,SECT. IX.,"To conclude then: the notes of the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν in Homer, probable or"
18813,SECT. IX.,"demonstrative, are these:"
18814,SECT. IX.,
18815,SECT. IX.,1. He must be born of Jupiter _ab antiquo_.
18816,SECT. IX.,
18817,SECT. IX.,"2. He must hold a sovereignty, either paramount or secondary, and"
18818,SECT. IX.,"either in whole, or, like Æneas, by devolution in part, over some given"
18819,SECT. IX.,place or tribe.
18820,SECT. IX.,
18821,SECT. IX.,3. His family must have held this sovereignty continuously from the
18822,SECT. IX.,time of the primary ancestor.
18823,SECT. IX.,
18824,SECT. IX.,4. He must be the head of a ruling tribe or house of the original
18825,SECT. IX.,Hellenic stock: and must be connected with marks of the presence of
18826,SECT. IX.,"Hellenic settlement. These marks may, as in the case of Agamemnon, be"
18827,SECT. IX.,"supplied by a race or tribe: or they may be territorial, such as those"
18828,SECT. IX.,"afforded by the name of the river Selleeis, and more especially by the"
18829,SECT. IX.,"name Ephyre, and the family of cognate words."
18830,SECT. IX.,
18831,SECT. IX.,"Now each of the six persons, to whom alone Homer gives the title ἄναξ"
18832,SECT. IX.,"ἀνδρῶν, partakes, by evidence either demonstrative or probable, of"
18833,SECT. IX.,every one of these notes.
18834,SECT. IX.,
18835,SECT. IX.,_Negative proofs._
18836,SECT. IX.,
18837,SECT. IX.,Among negative evidences that the title ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν conveys a peculiar
18838,SECT. IX.,"sense, we may place the following:"
18839,SECT. IX.,
18840,SECT. IX.,"1. The position of Priam in Troas, where he was the greatest man of"
18841,SECT. IX.,"North-western Asia, Il. xxiv. 543-6, and of Hector, or else Paris, as"
18842,SECT. IX.,"his heir, were such as called for the highest epithets of dignity. He"
18843,SECT. IX.,"had even a regular court of γέροντες, of whom it seems plain, that some"
18844,SECT. IX.,"at least, such as Antenor, were invested with some kind of sovereignty."
18845,SECT. IX.,Yet none of the Ilian family are called by the name of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν.
18846,SECT. IX.,
18847,SECT. IX.,2. Alcinous in the Odyssey affords another example of a lord over
18848,SECT. IX.,"lords, who does not belong to the historical Greek stem, and who"
18849,SECT. IX.,"therefore is not called ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. The example may appear weak,"
18850,SECT. IX.,because of the divine descent of the Phæacians. But if this phrase
18851,SECT. IX.,"had, like κρείων, been one of merely general ornament, why should it"
18852,SECT. IX.,"not have been applied to him as κρείων is, or to his brother Rhexenor,"
18853,SECT. IX.,or his father Nausithous? If the divine descent of the Phæacians from
18854,SECT. IX.,"Neptune renders the phrase inapplicable to them, this is of itself a"
18855,SECT. IX.,proof of its very specific nature.
18856,SECT. IX.,
18857,SECT. IX.,"3. Again; it may be asked why Glaucus was not an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, as he"
18858,SECT. IX.,"was descended from an Æolid sovereign. The answer is, he was no longer"
18859,SECT. IX.,the chieftain of any Hellenic clan. His grandfather Bellerophon had
18860,SECT. IX.,"migrated simply as an individual fugitive into a South-Asian country,"
18861,SECT. IX.,"of which the people had no immediate ties of race with him; and, while"
18862,SECT. IX.,"apart from his original tribe, he could not inherit a title as its head."
18863,SECT. IX.,
18864,SECT. IX.,4. Sarpedon was under the same disqualification as Glaucus his brother
18865,SECT. IX.,"king. Besides this, he was not descended in the male line from Æolus,"
18866,SECT. IX.,but only through his mother Hippodamia.
18867,SECT. IX.,
18868,SECT. IX.,"5. Again, among the Greeks. Why, it may be asked, was not Peleus, or"
18869,SECT. IX.,why was not Achilles an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν? Here was a throne above thrones:
18870,SECT. IX.,"for Patroclus was not only an ἄναξ, but was called Διογενὴς, which"
18871,SECT. IX.,implies sovereignty; therefore Menœtius his father was the same: but
18872,SECT. IX.,Menœtius was in attendance at the court of Peleus. Phœnix again was
18873,SECT. IX.,"tutor to that chief, though he ruled over the Dolopians by the gift of"
18874,SECT. IX.,"Peleus, as he tells us,"
18875,SECT. IX.,
18876,SECT. IX.,"καί μ’ ἀφνειὸν ἔθηκε, πολὺν δέ μοι ὤπασε λαὸν,"
18877,SECT. IX.,"ναῖον δ’ ἐσχατίην Φθίης, Δολόπεσσιν ἀνάσσων[879]."
18878,SECT. IX.,
18879,SECT. IX.,"Besides that he occupied a great position, and was of the highest"
18880,SECT. IX.,"descent, I think it is clear from the Catalogue that the Myrmidons,"
18881,SECT. IX.,"over whom Peleus reigned, were Achæans, and therefore a strictly Hellic"
18882,SECT. IX.,race.
18883,SECT. IX.,
18884,SECT. IX.,"And again, the character of Achilles makes it quite clear that his"
18885,SECT. IX.,family were from the Hellic stock. For it is in him that Homer has
18886,SECT. IX.,chosen to exhibit the prime and foremost pattern of the whole Greek
18887,SECT. IX.,nation: and he could surely never have chosen for such a purpose any
18888,SECT. IX.,"family of foreign, or of doubtful blood."
18889,SECT. IX.,
18890,SECT. IX.,"It is not however in every Hellic race or family, but only among the"
18891,SECT. IX.,"known representatives by descent of the principal or senior branches,"
18892,SECT. IX.,that we are justified in expecting to find the patriarchal title. And
18893,SECT. IX.,"still less do we know whether the Myrmidons, even though Hellic and"
18894,SECT. IX.,"Achæan, were a principal tribe of that stock."
18895,SECT. IX.,
18896,SECT. IX.,The evidence as to the descent of Achilles may throw further light upon
18897,SECT. IX.,this part of the subject.
18898,SECT. IX.,
18899,SECT. IX.,In those cases where a long line of ancestry purported to begin with
18900,SECT. IX.,"Jupiter, as, for instance, the Trojan genealogy, it is doubtless"
18901,SECT. IX.,"natural to treat this as a sort of necessary introduction to a period,"
18902,SECT. IX.,"beyond which the memory of man, unaided as it was, did not run."
18903,SECT. IX.,
18904,SECT. IX.,But when we find the paternity of a person contemporary with the Trojan
18905,SECT. IX.,"war, or of some near ancestor of his, referred to Jupiter, the most"
18906,SECT. IX.,"proper interpretation of this legendary statement seems to be, that"
18907,SECT. IX.,"they were, so to speak, _novi homines_, who having come suddenly into"
18908,SECT. IX.,"the blaze of celebrity, and living among a nation accustomed to ask"
18909,SECT. IX.,"of every passing stranger who were his parents, yet having no parents"
18910,SECT. IX.,"to quote, or none worth quoting, gilded their origin by claiming some"
18911,SECT. IX.,great deity for their father. I do not speak now of the distinct
18912,SECT. IX.,"and yet cognate case, where a similar pretext was used to shield"
18913,SECT. IX.,"illegitimacy: as for example, not to travel from the line before us, in"
18914,SECT. IX.,"the instance of the son of Polydora[880], sister to Achilles himself."
18915,SECT. IX.,But the same principle applies to both: divine progenitorship was used
18916,SECT. IX.,"to keep from view something that it was desirable to hide, whether this"
18917,SECT. IX.,"were the shame of a noble maiden, or the undistinguished ancestry of a"
18918,SECT. IX.,"great house or hero. Such a hero perhaps, according to this rule, was"
18919,SECT. IX.,"Hercules: such a house more clearly was that of the Æacids; for Æacus,"
18920,SECT. IX.,"grandfather of Achilles, was son of Jupiter[881]. He did not therefore"
18921,SECT. IX.,"represent a patriarchal family, and could not bear the title."
18922,SECT. IX.,
18923,SECT. IX.,"According to extra-Homeric tradition, the Myrmidons fled from Ægina to"
18924,SECT. IX.,Thessaly under Peleus[882].
18925,SECT. IX.,
18926,SECT. IX.,6. Further examples may be taken from the Pelopid family. The Menelaus
18927,SECT. IX.,of the Iliad belongs to the highest order: he is more kingly than the
18928,SECT. IX.,other kings[883]. In the Odyssey he desires to transplant Ulysses to a
18929,SECT. IX.,portion of his dominions (Od. iv. 174). And Ægisthus actually occupies
18930,SECT. IX.,"for years, during the exile of Orestes, the Pelopid throne: the name of"
18931,SECT. IX.,either Menelaus or Ægisthus is of the metrical value most convenient
18932,SECT. IX.,for union with the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν: but neither the one nor the other was
18933,SECT. IX.,"the representative of the great Achæan house of Pelops, and accordingly"
18934,SECT. IX.,neither the one nor the other receives the title.
18935,SECT. IX.,
18936,SECT. IX.,"7. Diomed is a Greek of the very highest descent: of him alone, among"
18937,SECT. IX.,"the kings before Troy, we may confidently say, that he was himself a"
18938,SECT. IX.,"hero, had a hero for his father, a hero for his uncle, and a hero for"
18939,SECT. IX.,"his grandfather. Œneus, Tydeus, Meleager, are three names not easily"
18940,SECT. IX.,"to be matched in early Greek story. They were likewise near the stock,"
18941,SECT. IX.,"as we may probably infer from the name of the founder of the race,"
18942,SECT. IX.,"Portheus, the Destroyer. He was father of Œneus and also of Ἄγριος the"
18943,SECT. IX.,"Rude, and Μέλας the Swarthy, all names indicating that the first stage"
18944,SECT. IX.,of arrival within the precinct of civilization had not yet been passed.
18945,SECT. IX.,"He commanded, too, one of the largest contingents: yet neither he nor"
18946,SECT. IX.,"his uncle Meleager, the Achilles of his day, is ever called ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν."
18947,SECT. IX.,
18948,SECT. IX.,"The reason doubtless is that, in the case of the Œneid family, there is"
18949,SECT. IX.,no connection with a leading Greek ancestry. They are neither Æolid nor
18950,SECT. IX.,Pelopid; and they stand in no relation to the characteristic names of
18951,SECT. IX.,Ephyre and the Selleeis.
18952,SECT. IX.,
18953,SECT. IX.,"8. Let me notice, lastly, the case of Nestor. He had been a warrior"
18954,SECT. IX.,of the first class. His rich dominions supplied a contingent of ninety
18955,SECT. IX.,"ships to the war; larger even than that of Diomed, or of any chief"
18956,SECT. IX.,"whatever, except Agamemnon, who had one hundred. His father, Neleus,"
18957,SECT. IX.,was of great fame. He had actually more influence in council than any
18958,SECT. IX.,"other chief, and always took the lead there. He was descended from"
18959,SECT. IX.,"Neptune, who indeed was but his grandfather: while his grandmother,"
18960,SECT. IX.,"Tyro, was probably, as we have found, a granddaughter of Æolus."
18961,SECT. IX.,
18962,SECT. IX.,"But he could not be ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, because not in lineal male descent"
18963,SECT. IX.,from the primary ancestor Æolus: nor was he the tribal head of the
18964,SECT. IX.,"Hellenic race among which he ruled, which was an Achæan one (Il. xi."
18965,SECT. IX.,"759), since the Achæans owned the Pelopids for their chiefs. Also his"
18966,SECT. IX.,"father Neleus, apparently the younger twin, had migrated from the"
18967,SECT. IX.,"North, leaving Pelias the elder, as is probable, in possession. Thus"
18968,SECT. IX.,Nestor presents none of the four notes of the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν. Yet this
18969,SECT. IX.,"title attached to an insignificant relative, Eumelus, his first cousin"
18970,SECT. IX.,"once removed, doubtless because he possessed them."
18971,SECT. IX.,
18972,SECT. IX.,_Persons with the notes yet without the title._
18973,SECT. IX.,
18974,SECT. IX.,It is certainly true that there are a few cases where Homer has _not_
18975,SECT. IX.,"applied the title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν to particular persons, to whom he"
18976,SECT. IX.,"might have given it consistently with the suppositions, as to its"
18977,SECT. IX.,"meaning, of which I have attempted to show the truth. They are, in one"
18978,SECT. IX.,"word, the ancestors of the persons to whom he has actually given the"
18979,SECT. IX.,"title. But all of these, such as Pelops and his line, Dardanus with his"
18980,SECT. IX.,"line as far as Tros, and the earlier descendants of Æolus, are persons"
18981,SECT. IX.,"mentioned in the poems for the most part but once, and rarely more than"
18982,SECT. IX.,"twice or thrice. Now, as Homer mentions frequently without the prefix,"
18983,SECT. IX.,"ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, those to whom on other occasions he gives it, we are not"
18984,SECT. IX.,entitled to require its application to all persons capable of bearing
18985,SECT. IX.,"it, whom he mentions but once."
18986,SECT. IX.,
18987,SECT. IX.,"And again, if I am right in holding that this was strictly a title"
18988,SECT. IX.,"attaching to lineage, then it was wholly needless, when he had"
18989,SECT. IX.,"designated a particular person, as an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, to grace his"
18990,SECT. IX.,"predecessors also with the title, because, as a matter of course,"
18991,SECT. IX.,"inasmuch as they were his predecessors, it attached to them. No"
18992,SECT. IX.,"historic aim then was involved, and no purpose would have been gained"
18993,SECT. IX.,"if Admetus, for example, had been mentioned with this title as well as"
18994,SECT. IX.,his son Eumelus.
18995,SECT. IX.,
18996,SECT. IX.,"But, I confess, it appears to me to afford no small confirmation to the"
18997,SECT. IX.,"arguments and the conclusions of these pages, when we remember that"
18998,SECT. IX.,"not only do the four rules for the sense of the phrase suit, as far as"
18999,SECT. IX.,"we can tell, all the six persons to whom it is applied, but that there"
19000,SECT. IX.,"is absolutely no other living person named in the poems, whom they"
19001,SECT. IX.,"would not effectually exclude, with the insignificant exceptions, first"
19002,SECT. IX.,"of Admetus, who has just been mentioned, and next of Orestes. In the"
19003,SECT. IX.,"Iliad, Orestes is only named in one single passage (twice repeated), of"
19004,SECT. IX.,"the Ninth Book[884]. In the Odyssey he is named several times, but the"
19005,SECT. IX.,title of ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν is less suitable to the political state of Greece
19006,SECT. IX.,"as it appears in this poem, and also to the subject. It never appears,"
19007,SECT. IX.,except retrospectively.
19008,SECT. IX.,
19009,SECT. IX.,"A few words may perhaps be due to the case of Polyxeinus, grandson of"
19010,SECT. IX.,"Augeias, who, it is just possible, though unlikely, may have retained"
19011,SECT. IX.,"the position of his grandfather. It is just possible, because we are"
19012,SECT. IX.,"not assured of the contrary; but most unlikely, because Augeias appears"
19013,SECT. IX.,"as lord of the Epeans, Polyxeinus only as commanding a division of"
19014,SECT. IX.,"them. Again, Polyxeinus is only once mentioned. It is also evident that"
19015,SECT. IX.,"the loss of his grandfather’s throne, by a revolution in Elis, might"
19016,SECT. IX.,naturally put an end to the application of the title in his particular
19017,SECT. IX.,"case, by a process exactly the same with that to which its general and"
19018,SECT. IX.,"final extinction, now so speedily to arrive, was due."
19019,SECT. IX.,
19020,SECT. IX.,"It might indeed be of some interest to inquire why it is that, when"
19021,SECT. IX.,Homer makes no practical or effective use of the phrase for any one
19022,SECT. IX.,"except Agamemnon, he has notwithstanding been careful to register,"
19023,SECT. IX.,"as it were, a title to it on behalf of five other persons? Nor can I"
19024,SECT. IX.,"doubt that the just answer would be, that he did this because, with his"
19025,SECT. IX.,"historic aims, he may have deemed it a matter of national interest to"
19026,SECT. IX.,record a title of such peculiar and primitive significance.
19027,SECT. IX.,
19028,SECT. IX.,_Its disappearance with Homer._
19029,SECT. IX.,
19030,SECT. IX.,But of all the negative arguments that tend to show ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν not to
19031,SECT. IX.,"have been a merely vague title, there is none on which I dwell with"
19032,SECT. IX.,more confidence than its total disappearance with the Homeric age.
19033,SECT. IX.,"For it was not so with the other less peculiar forms, βασιλεὺς, ἄναξ,"
19034,SECT. IX.,and κρείων. Although they were supplanted in actual use by the term
19035,SECT. IX.,"τυραννὸς, which became for the Greeks the type of supreme power in"
19036,SECT. IX.,"the hands of a single person, yet the idea of them was traditionally"
19037,SECT. IX.,"retained. Accordingly, even the name βασιλεὺς was applied by Greek"
19038,SECT. IX.,"writers to contemporary kings out of Greece, and to the old bygone"
19039,SECT. IX.,"Greek monarchies: and Thucydides has given it to them as a class, where"
19040,SECT. IX.,"he describes the πατρικαὶ βασιλεῖαι[885]. But the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν,"
19041,SECT. IX.,"the most specific of them all, disappears even from retrospective"
19042,SECT. IX.,"use: and the inference is, that its proper meaning had ceased to be"
19043,SECT. IX.,represented in the institutions either of Greece or of the known world
19044,SECT. IX.,beyond the Greek borders; that it had passed away with the archaic
19045,SECT. IX.,"system, of which it was the peculiar token."
19046,SECT. IX.,
19047,SECT. IX.,"Even independently of direct testimony, we might be assured that"
19048,SECT. IX.,the patriarchal and highland constitution of society could not very
19049,SECT. IX.,long survive the multiplication of settlements in the plains. For
19050,SECT. IX.,"the wealth, which these settlements created through the increased"
19051,SECT. IX.,"efficiency of labour, the greater bounty of the earth, and the"
19052,SECT. IX.,"augmented means of communication and exchange, could not but bring with"
19053,SECT. IX.,"it at once new temptations, and new sources of disturbance; whereas the"
19054,SECT. IX.,"art of controlling these evils was but painfully and slowly, and most"
19055,SECT. IX.,"incompletely learned. Among highland tribes, there might be war and"
19056,SECT. IX.,pillage with a view to immediate wants: but stored wealth could not be
19057,SECT. IX.,"stolen, where, except in its simplest forms, it did not exist: and men"
19058,SECT. IX.,"do not overturn hereditary power, or drag society into revolutions,"
19059,SECT. IX.,without an object.
19060,SECT. IX.,
19061,SECT. IX.,"But the Catalogue, as well as other parts of the Homeric poems, show"
19062,SECT. IX.,us how the causes thus indicated had already worked. Of the Greek
19063,SECT. IX.,"States comprised in that invaluable enumeration, some were, as is"
19064,SECT. IX.,"plainly asserted or implied, monarchically governed: for example, the"
19065,SECT. IX.,"Mycenians, the Spartans, the Pylians, the Myrmidons, the Arcadians,"
19066,SECT. IX.,"the Eubœans[886], and the Ætolians. We may reasonably infer the same"
19067,SECT. IX.,"with regard to the followers of those great chiefs, who are treated as"
19068,SECT. IX.,"Βασιλεῖς in the body of the poems: the Salaminians and Locrians, each"
19069,SECT. IX.,"under their Ajax, the Cephallenians under Ulysses, the Cretans, or else"
19070,SECT. IX.,"a portion of them, under Idomeneus, the Argives under Diomed. In each"
19071,SECT. IX.,"of these cases, either there is but a single leader, or, as in the two"
19072,SECT. IX.,"last, the text makes it obvious that the chief first named is supreme"
19073,SECT. IX.,in rank. We may probably infer that monarchy prevailed in all the
19074,SECT. IX.,"instances, including the Athenians, when only a single general appears."
19075,SECT. IX.,"The expression δῆμος, applied to Athens, is perfectly compatible with"
19076,SECT. IX.,"kingship in Homer. But there remain six cases, where there are a"
19077,SECT. IX.,"plurality of leaders, apparently on an equal footing. These are the"
19078,SECT. IX.,cases of
19079,SECT. IX.,
19080,SECT. IX.,1. The Bœotians.
19081,SECT. IX.,
19082,SECT. IX.,2. The people of Aspledon and the Minyeian Orchomenus; who are in fact
19083,SECT. IX.,a second Bœotian contingent.
19084,SECT. IX.,
19085,SECT. IX.,3. The Phocians.
19086,SECT. IX.,
19087,SECT. IX.,4. The Elians or Epeans: who differ from the others in being formally
19088,SECT. IX.,"distributed into four divisions, under four leaders, and who are"
19089,SECT. IX.,therefore strictly acephalous.
19090,SECT. IX.,
19091,SECT. IX.,"5. The Nisurians, &c."
19092,SECT. IX.,
19093,SECT. IX.,"6. The people of Tricce, Ithome, and Œchalia, under the sons of"
19094,SECT. IX.,Asclepius.
19095,SECT. IX.,
19096,SECT. IX.,"It is observable with respect to the four first of these, that"
19097,SECT. IX.,"they were all in the comparatively open, and rich country; liable,"
19098,SECT. IX.,"therefore, to the influences which, as Thucydides observes[887],"
19099,SECT. IX.,"made Bœotia, Thessaly, and most of Peloponnesus peculiarly liable to"
19100,SECT. IX.,"revolutions; and whence doubtless it is, that Homer has been led to"
19101,SECT. IX.,"tell us that Amphion and Zethus built walls for Thebes, because they"
19102,SECT. IX.,could not hold it without them.
19103,SECT. IX.,
19104,SECT. IX.,"With respect to the Nisurians, in stating that they were under"
19105,SECT. IX.,"Pheidippus and Antiphus, Homer adds that these were (Il. ii. 679)"
19106,SECT. IX.,
19107,SECT. IX.,Θεσσαλοῦ υἷε δύω Ἡρακλείδαο ἄνακτος.
19108,SECT. IX.,
19109,SECT. IX.,On which we may observe
19110,SECT. IX.,
19111,SECT. IX.,1. That the power divided between them had apparently been monarchical
19112,SECT. IX.,in the preceding generation.
19113,SECT. IX.,
19114,SECT. IX.,2. That the name of their father points to his having been born
19115,SECT. IX.,"in Thessaly[888], which from its richness was peculiarly open to"
19116,SECT. IX.,revolutions.
19117,SECT. IX.,
19118,SECT. IX.,"3. That he was the son of Hercules, with whose name disturbance and"
19119,SECT. IX.,convulsion are so much associated.
19120,SECT. IX.,
19121,SECT. IX.,"In the case of the sons of Asclepius, there is the same presumption"
19122,SECT. IX.,that they divided a power which had been monarchical: and although the
19123,SECT. IX.,"epithet κλωμακόεσσα given to Ithome, the site of which is unknown[889],"
19124,SECT. IX.,"may suggest rough and broken ground, yet the territory is within the"
19125,SECT. IX.,"limits of Thessaly[890], and on the river Peneus. Tricce was known"
19126,SECT. IX.,in the historic times; and it is mentioned in Homer with the epithet
19127,SECT. IX.,"ἱππόβοτος, indicating fertility."
19128,SECT. IX.,
19129,SECT. IX.,_Signs of political disorganisation._
19130,SECT. IX.,
19131,SECT. IX.,"Here, then, and particularly in the Bœotian and Elian cases, we have"
19132,SECT. IX.,considerable signs of the weakening and gradual breaking up of the
19133,SECT. IX.,old highland institutions: I distinguish between those two and the
19134,SECT. IX.,"rest, because where the division is only between two brothers, it may"
19135,SECT. IX.,have implied little deviation from the monarchical form. Still that
19136,SECT. IX.,little might be the first stage of a deviation which was soon to grow
19137,SECT. IX.,indefinitely large.
19138,SECT. IX.,
19139,SECT. IX.,"There are other signs to the same effect, both in the Iliad, and to a"
19140,SECT. IX.,greater extent in the Odyssey.
19141,SECT. IX.,
19142,SECT. IX.,For example: the dynasty of the Œneids had disappeared among the
19143,SECT. IX.,"Ætolians[891]: the dynasty of the Æolids, and the name Ephyre, from"
19144,SECT. IX.,"Corinth[892]: Polyxeinus, the grandson of Augeias, an ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν, is"
19145,SECT. IX.,"not described as an ἄναξ, or lord, at all: Hercules had laid waste the"
19146,SECT. IX.,"cities about Ephyre, and the cities about Pylos[893]: Tlepolemus, at"
19147,SECT. IX.,"war with his Heraclid relations, had been driven to emigrate to Rhodes:"
19148,SECT. IX.,and all this since the family of the Perseids had disappeared before
19149,SECT. IX.,the Pelopids.
19150,SECT. IX.,
19151,SECT. IX.,The changes observable in the Odyssey are such as connect themselves
19152,SECT. IX.,"with a species of deluge, which had apparently overspread the face of"
19153,SECT. IX.,"the political society of Greece. They would merit a full examination,"
19154,SECT. IX.,in connection with a view of the relation of that poem to the Iliad.
19155,SECT. IX.,"Here it need only be observed, that the ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν appears nowhere"
19156,SECT. IX.,"in the action of the Odyssey: the phrase is used but twice, and then"
19157,SECT. IX.,only with reference to the dead Agamemnon: and that the partial
19158,SECT. IX.,disappearance of the word from the later work of Homer evidently
19159,SECT. IX.,accompanies a great approach towards disorganisation of the old order
19160,SECT. IX.,of things and ideas in the political state of Greece.
19161,SECT. IX.,
19162,SECT. IX.,_Summary of the whole._
19163,SECT. IX.,
19164,SECT. IX.,"I may now collect the results, as far as they are related to the"
19165,SECT. IX.,"present subject, of our whole ethnological inquiry."
19166,SECT. IX.,
19167,SECT. IX.,"1. From the Homeric text, the phrase ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν appears not to have"
19168,SECT. IX.,"belonged to political preeminence or power, or to personal heroism,"
19169,SECT. IX.,"or to the distinction of wealth, or to divine descent as such; but to"
19170,SECT. IX.,the archaic form of sovereignty which united it continuously with the
19171,SECT. IX.,"headship in blood of a ruling family or clan, inhabiting the country"
19172,SECT. IX.,"which was the reputed cradle of the nation, or able to trace lineally"
19173,SECT. IX.,its derivation from that country. A tradition of original descent from
19174,SECT. IX.,Jupiter attached in all cases essentially to the possession of the
19175,SECT. IX.,title.
19176,SECT. IX.,
19177,SECT. IX.,"2. In each of the six instances where Homer employs it, he appears to"
19178,SECT. IX.,do so in strict conformity with the rules thus indicated.
19179,SECT. IX.,
19180,SECT. IX.,"3. The immediate cradle of those Greek races, which possessed this"
19181,SECT. IX.,"primitive title and descent, was Thessaly; and of Thessaly Hellas was"
19182,SECT. IX.,"either a synonym, or a part."
19183,SECT. IX.,
19184,SECT. IX.,4. The origin of the races thus ruling Hellas is to be sought among the
19185,SECT. IX.,"Helli, who dwelt in the mountains around Dodona, apparently with those"
19186,SECT. IX.,institutions which have ever been characteristic of mountaineers; and
19187,SECT. IX.,"who represent, more faithfully than the inhabitants of lowlands, the"
19188,SECT. IX.,"earliest type of human society, cast at a time when its relationship to"
19189,SECT. IX.,the family was still palpable and near.
19190,SECT. IX.,
19191,SECT. IX.,"5. The resemblances of the Helli and the Dardans afford, together with"
19192,SECT. IX.,"the probabilities of the case, strong evidence of their having some"
19193,SECT. IX.,"common affinity to the same branch of the great stem, from which a"
19194,SECT. IX.,large part of Europe was peopled with its ruling race.
19195,SECT. IX.,
19196,SECT. IX.,"6. Finally, we may with reasonable grounds conjecture, that the"
19197,SECT. IX.,"patriarchal system denoted by the patriarchal chieftaincies, which had"
19198,SECT. IX.,"been shaken before the Trojan war, was further and violently disturbed"
19199,SECT. IX.,"by it, and by its direct and indirect political consequences; and that"
19200,SECT. IX.,this system had vanished before the line of the post-Homeric Greek
19201,SECT. IX.,"poets, to be reckoned from Hesiod, had begun. Thus, the basis of the"
19202,SECT. IX.,"title being removed, the title itself naturally disappeared from"
19203,SECT. IX.,"literature as well as history; and if we find, that in later times"
19204,SECT. IX.,"the key to its meaning had been lost, it is but a new mark of the"
19205,SECT. IX.,abruptness and width of the breach that lies between Homer and his
19206,SECT. IX.,"successors, of the paucity of continuous traditions, and of the limited"
19207,SECT. IX.,means possessed by the Greeks of the historic ages for research into
19208,SECT. IX.,the earlier periods of their national existence.

19491,SECT. X.,
19492,SECT. X.,
19493,SECT. X.,"We have reached the close of this inquiry, so far as it regards the"
19494,SECT. X.,"origin, character, and pursuits of the Pelasgians; the character of"
19495,SECT. X.,"the Hellenic tribes, and their relations to the Pelasgians; and the"
19496,SECT. X.,"position of the Achæans among the Hellenes, as the first national"
19497,SECT. X.,"representatives of the Hellenic stock. But who were these Achæans, and"
19498,SECT. X.,whence did they come? We have at present been able only to describe
19499,SECT. X.,them by negatives. They were not the descendants of a legendary Achæus:
19500,SECT. X.,"they did not take their name from a Greek territory, nor from any"
19501,SECT. X.,pursuit that they followed; and the word has no apparent root in the
19502,SECT. X.,etymology of the Greek tongue.
19503,SECT. X.,
19504,SECT. X.,But we have seen manifest indications that the Hellic name did not
19505,SECT. X.,first come into being on the western side of the Dardanelles: and if
19506,SECT. X.,"the Achæi were the first leaders of the Helli, why should we not trace"
19507,SECT. X.,"them too beyond the Straits, and thus follow perhaps the Helli also, by"
19508,SECT. X.,"their means, and as represented in them, up to a fountain-head?"
19509,SECT. X.,
19510,SECT. X.,"At the same time, if I presume to affiliate the Hellic nation upon any"
19511,SECT. X.,"Eastern parentage, and, again, to suggest relationships between that"
19512,SECT. X.,"nation and others, which had also migrated from the first nurseries"
19513,SECT. X.,"of man towards the West, it will, I hope, be understood, that all"
19514,SECT. X.,"such propositions are asserted, not only as not demonstrable, but as"
19515,SECT. X.,"likewise being, even within their own limits, those of merely probable"
19516,SECT. X.,"truth, subject, by an admission tacitly carried all along, to every"
19517,SECT. X.,"kind of qualification. The succession and intermixture of races, the"
19518,SECT. X.,"combinations of language, the sympathetic and imitative communication"
19519,SECT. X.,"of ideas and institutions, form a mass of phenomena complex enough, and"
19520,SECT. X.,"difficult to describe, even by contemporaries; how much more so by the"
19521,SECT. X.,aid only of those faint and scattered rays that we can now find cast
19522,SECT. X.,upon them.
19523,SECT. X.,
19524,SECT. X.,Let us then proceed to consider what aid can be had from other sources
19525,SECT. X.,"in support of those presumptions, arising out of the text of Homer,"
19526,SECT. X.,"which tend to connect the Hellenes of his day, and the Achæans as their"
19527,SECT. X.,"leading tribe, with the East."
19528,SECT. X.,
19529,SECT. X.,"And here we may look first, as far as regards the general outlines of"
19530,SECT. X.,"race and language, to the ethnological evidences afforded by the course"
19531,SECT. X.,of migration from Central Asia over Europe.
19532,SECT. X.,
19533,SECT. X.,"Next, to the evidence of those among ancient authors, who have taken"
19534,SECT. X.,notice of this diffusion in such a manner as in any degree to guide us
19535,SECT. X.,towards the sources of the great factors of the Greek nation.
19536,SECT. X.,
19537,SECT. X.,"After that, we will inquire whether the names themselves, which are"
19538,SECT. X.,"employed in Homer for the contemporary Greeks, can, by comparison with"
19539,SECT. X.,"cognate names elsewhere, afford us any light."
19540,SECT. X.,
19541,SECT. X.,"And lastly, whether in the quarter to which these lines of information"
19542,SECT. X.,"would lead us, we can discover any of those resemblances of manners"
19543,SECT. X.,"and character with the Greeks which, if found, would afford the most"
19544,SECT. X.,satisfactory corroboration to the argument in favour of the derivation
19545,SECT. X.,of one from the other.
19546,SECT. X.,
19547,SECT. X.,The labours of ethnologists have associated together in one great
19548,SECT. X.,"family, at first called Indo-Germanic, and then Indo-European, but"
19549,SECT. X.,"threatening to expand even beyond the scope of that comprehensive name,"
19550,SECT. X.,a mass of leading languages from the Celtic regions in the west to the
19551,SECT. X.,plains of India in the east.
19552,SECT. X.,
19553,SECT. X.,_High German and Low German races._
19554,SECT. X.,
19555,SECT. X.,"This great family, says Dr. Donaldson[894], divides itself into two"
19556,SECT. X.,groups. To these two groups respectively belong the Low German and the
19557,SECT. X.,High German tongues: the former spoken in the plain countries to the
19558,SECT. X.,"north of Europe, the latter in the more mountainous countries to the"
19559,SECT. X.,"south. The Low German languages contain evidence of greater antiquity,"
19560,SECT. X.,and those who speak them appear to have been driven onward in their
19561,SECT. X.,migrations by the High Germans following them: the latter entering
19562,SECT. X.,"Europe by Asia Minor, the former to the north of the Euxine."
19563,SECT. X.,
19564,SECT. X.,The distinction runs back to the earlier seat of the race in Ariana or
19565,SECT. X.,"Iran, a portion of Asia which may be loosely defined as lying between"
19566,SECT. X.,"the Caspian and the Indian ocean to the north and south, the Indus"
19567,SECT. X.,and the Euphrates to the east and west. Within these limits are to be
19568,SECT. X.,"found two forms of language, holding the same relation to one another"
19569,SECT. X.,as that which subsists between the High German and Low German tongues;
19570,SECT. X.,"the first, corresponding with the High German, was spoken among the"
19571,SECT. X.,"countries of the south-west, where lies Persia proper, and the other in"
19572,SECT. X.,"its more northern and eastern portions, of which Media formed a central"
19573,SECT. X.,part. The population of this great tract issued forth in the direction
19574,SECT. X.,"of the south-east, over the northern parts of India; and again towards"
19575,SECT. X.,"Asia Minor and Europe, in the direction of the north-west. Those who"
19576,SECT. X.,"came first proceeded from Media, and supplied the base of what have"
19577,SECT. X.,"been called, the Low German nations: Sarmatians, Saxons, Getæ (or"
19578,SECT. X.,"Scythians or Goths). The language of these emigrants was that which,"
19579,SECT. X.,"when it assumed an organized or classical form, and with due allowance"
19580,SECT. X.,"for changes which the lapse of time must have introduced, became the"
19581,SECT. X.,"tongue now best represented, at least as a literary language, by the"
19582,SECT. X.,Sanscrit.
19583,SECT. X.,
19584,SECT. X.,The whole course of history seems to indicate a struggle of races in
19585,SECT. X.,"that quarter of the world, which may be used to illustrate the present"
19586,SECT. X.,inquiry. To a certain extent the scene of that struggle may be pointed
19587,SECT. X.,"out on the map. From the Caspian towards the south, and from the"
19588,SECT. X.,"head of the Persian Gulf towards the north, the land soon rises to a"
19589,SECT. X.,"great general elevation, but with marked and also highly diversified"
19590,SECT. X.,inequalities. Media would appear to have occupied the principal part of
19591,SECT. X.,"the great central space, defined by the mountains which form the outer"
19592,SECT. X.,line of this elevation. It corresponds with what is now the Province
19593,SECT. X.,"of Irak, and Ispahan is its principal city. Here, says Malcolm[895],"
19594,SECT. X.,"we find the happiest climate that Persia can boast. To the south,"
19595,SECT. X.,"near the Gulf, the summer heat is overpowering: as the country rises"
19596,SECT. X.,"towards Shiraz the climate becomes temperate, and further improves as"
19597,SECT. X.,"we advance northward, until we approach the hills that divide Irak from"
19598,SECT. X.,"Mazenderan on the Caspian, where it deteriorates."
19599,SECT. X.,
19600,SECT. X.,_The Province of Fars or Persia proper._
19601,SECT. X.,
19602,SECT. X.,"Immediately to the south of Irak, and touching the Persian gulf, a"
19603,SECT. X.,"little to the east of the Karoon and Jerokh, which are the eastern"
19604,SECT. X.,"tributaries of the great central rivers, Tigris and Euphrates, is"
19605,SECT. X.,"the Province of Fars, which ascends the hills to its capital town"
19606,SECT. X.,"Shiraz, and then extends in a north-easterly direction towards the"
19607,SECT. X.,sandy deserts. This is the province[896] where the Persian race is
19608,SECT. X.,still to be found in its greatest purity; and from this tract the name
19609,SECT. X.,"of Persia, attached by Europeans to the empire of Iran, is supposed"
19610,SECT. X.,"to be derived[897]. From Fars or Pars, for both forms are understood"
19611,SECT. X.,"to exist, is drawn the name Parsee, borne by the fire-worshippers,"
19612,SECT. X.,who migrated for safety into India: and the same root appears to be
19613,SECT. X.,"clearly traceable in the great Persian tribe of Pasargadæ, named by"
19614,SECT. X.,Herodotus[898] as the leading tribe of the country. But though the
19615,SECT. X.,province of Fars now embraces a considerable range of country and
19616,SECT. X.,"diversity of climate, all that is recorded of the ancient Persians"
19617,SECT. X.,would seem to connect them particularly with its ruder and more
19618,SECT. X.,mountainous parts: for we have every reason to believe that Herodotus
19619,SECT. X.,"spoke truly when he described the Persians, properly so called, as"
19620,SECT. X.,"poor, and their country as hard and barren in comparison with the rich"
19621,SECT. X.,"valleys of Media, which at an early date attracted and repaid the"
19622,SECT. X.,"labours of agriculture. It was inhabited, as Herodotus[899] says, κατὰ"
19623,SECT. X.,"κώμας, that is, in the Pelasgian fashion, at the time when Dejoces"
19624,SECT. X.,acquired the throne.

19627,SECT. X.,"energies, and the more advanced, but also more relaxed inhabitants"
19628,SECT. X.,"of the more favoured district, is indicated even amidst the"
19629,SECT. X.,indistinctness of the earliest efforts of history. Ethnologically the
19630,SECT. X.,"general character of the movement is that of a pressure, to adopt the"
19631,SECT. X.,"language of Dr. Donaldson[900], of the High upon the Low Iranians; I"
19632,SECT. X.,"would be understood, however, to signify by the terms High and Low a"
19633,SECT. X.,distinction in language and not one in altitude of site. The overthrow
19634,SECT. X.,"of the Median empire by the Persians, related in different forms by"
19635,SECT. X.,"Ctesias and Herodotus, and again in Holy Scripture, whatever be its"
19636,SECT. X.,"chronological epoch, may be taken as a great crisis in the struggle,"
19637,SECT. X.,at which the High Iranians established themselves in the country of
19638,SECT. X.,"the Low, and in permanent political ascendancy among them. The Magian"
19639,SECT. X.,"revolution, doubtless a great reaction against this ascendancy, was of"
19640,SECT. X.,"short duration. The invasion of Media by the Scythians, which Herodotus"
19641,SECT. X.,has reported as proceeding from beyond the Euxine and the Palus
19642,SECT. X.,"Mæotis, but which was more probably from the east of the Caspian[901],"
19643,SECT. X.,"indicates, it is probable, another form of this reaction. This invasion"
19644,SECT. X.,"took place under Cyaxares, the grandson of Dejoces: and we may perhaps"
19645,SECT. X.,"consider Media as having at this time received Persian influences,"
19646,SECT. X.,"possibly by the immigration of groups of Persian families, before the"
19647,SECT. X.,"general ascendancy of that race, just as we see the Æolid houses, and"
19648,SECT. X.,"the family of Perseus, finding their way into Southern Greece before"
19649,SECT. X.,"the days of the Achæan race, and of the general Hellenic ascendancy in"
19650,SECT. X.,the country.
19651,SECT. X.,
19652,SECT. X.,The resemblance of the modern Persian to the modern High German
19653,SECT. X.,language has been observed[902]: and it has even been thought
19654,SECT. X.,"probable, for reasons which will presently be considered, that the"
19655,SECT. X.,German name may have been derived from that quarter. The Hellic
19656,SECT. X.,ingredient of the Greek tongue is referred to a similar origin. On the
19657,SECT. X.,"other hand, we are told that a traveller[903], taking a popular rather"
19658,SECT. X.,"than a scientific view of language, has noticed the strong resemblance"
19659,SECT. X.,"between the Latin and the modern Sclavonian forms. Again, the structure"
19660,SECT. X.,"of the Latin language, from its repelling certain more modern"
19661,SECT. X.,"tendencies of the Greek, is taken to indicate an antiquity beyond that"
19662,SECT. X.,"of the Greek: and there is also an opinion that the older Greek forms,"
19663,SECT. X.,"like the Latin, bear marks of correspondence with the Sclavonic. All"
19664,SECT. X.,"this would tend to sustain the belief that the Pelasgians, who formed"
19665,SECT. X.,"the older portion, and the basis, of the population of Italy and"
19666,SECT. X.,"Greece, were offshoots from the old, or Low Iranian tribes: and that"
19667,SECT. X.,the more recent element was High Iranian or Persian.

19670,SECT. X.,
19671,SECT. X.,"Ethnological affinities, illustrative of what has here been advanced,"

19673,SECT. X.,Strabo has said on this subject is particularly deserving of notice.
19674,SECT. X.,His derivation of the German name from the Latin word _Germanus_ may
19675,SECT. X.,"indeed be passed by as a notion which cannot be maintained, although it"

19677,SECT. X.,"since even Roman inscriptions show, that it existed three hundred years"
19678,SECT. X.,"before that historian. It is however very remarkable, that Strabo"
19679,SECT. X.,asserts the Germans and the Celts to have been nearly associated:
19680,SECT. X.,μικρὸν ἐξαλλάττοντες τοῦ Κελτικοῦ φύλου τῷ τε πλεονασμῷ τῆς
19681,SECT. X.,"ἀγριότητος, καὶ τοῦ μεγέθους, καὶ τῆς ξανθότητος, τἄλλα δὲ παραπλήσιοι"

19683,SECT. X.,
19684,SECT. X.,_And to Hellenes._
19685,SECT. X.,
19686,SECT. X.,"Now, the result of all that we have drawn from Homer thus far would"
19687,SECT. X.,"be to connect the Celts with the Pelasgi, with Media, and with the"
19688,SECT. X.,Low Iranian countries: the ‘Germans’ with the Helli and with Persia.
19689,SECT. X.,"Observe, then, how the differences, noted by Strabo between Celts and"
19690,SECT. X.,"‘Germans,’ correspond with the Homeric differences between Helli and"
19691,SECT. X.,"Pelasgi. First, as to ἀγριότης: let us call to mind the history of the"
19692,SECT. X.,name Ἀργεῖος; the use of Ἄγριος as an early Hellic proper name; the
19693,SECT. X.,absence of names of this class among the Pelasgians; the rude manners
19694,SECT. X.,"of the Helli and the Pheres; the pacific habits, wealth, and advanced"
19695,SECT. X.,agriculture of the Pelasgian populations. Then as to stature: how this
19696,SECT. X.,"gift has Diana for its goddess, how it is a standing and essential"
19697,SECT. X.,"element of beauty for women as well as men, how the Greek Chiefs in the"
19698,SECT. X.,"Third Iliad are distinguished from the crowd by size,"
19699,SECT. X.,
19700,SECT. X.,"ὥς μοι καὶ τόνδ’ ἄνδρα πελώριον ἐξονομήνῃς,"
19701,SECT. X.,"ὅστις ὅδ’ ἐστὶν Ἀχαιὸς ἀνὴρ ἠΰς τε μέγας τε[906],"
19702,SECT. X.,
19703,SECT. X.,"and how Achilles, the bravest and mightiest chief of this army, was the"
19704,SECT. X.,first also in beauty and in size; for Ajax is always recorded as next
19705,SECT. X.,"to him, and at the same time as before all others[907]; except Nireus,"
19706,SECT. X.,"who was beautiful, but who as a soldier was mere trash."
19707,SECT. X.,
19708,SECT. X.,"And, lastly, as to the auburn hair, which was with Homer in such"
19709,SECT. X.,esteem. Menelaus is ξανθός (_passim_); so is Meleager (Il. ii. 642);
19710,SECT. X.,so is Rhadamanthus (Od. iv. 564); Agamede (Il. xi. 739); Ulysses (Od.
19711,SECT. X.,"xiii. 399, 431); lastly, Achilles (Il. i. 197). But never once, I"
19712,SECT. X.,"think, does Homer bestow this epithet upon a Pelasgian name. None of"
19713,SECT. X.,"the Trojan royal family, so renowned for beauty, are ξανθοί: none of"
19714,SECT. X.,"the Chiefs, not even Euphorbus[908], of whose flowing hair the Poet has"
19715,SECT. X.,given us so beautiful and even so impassioned a description. Nothing
19716,SECT. X.,"Pelasgian, but Ceres[909] the καλλιπλόκαμος, is admitted to the honour"
19717,SECT. X.,of the epithet. It could hardly be denied to the goddess of the ruddy
19718,SECT. X.,harvest:
19719,SECT. X.,
19720,SECT. X.,Excutit et flavas aurea terra comas[910].
19721,SECT. X.,
19722,SECT. X.,"Now Tacitus, describing the Germani, gives them _truces et cærulei"
19723,SECT. X.,"oculi, rutilæ comæ, magna corpora_[911]. His treatise supplies many"
19724,SECT. X.,other points of comparison.
19725,SECT. X.,
19726,SECT. X.,"It is obvious, to compare the names of Scythæ, Getæ, Gothi, Massagetæ,"
19727,SECT. X.,"Mœsi, Mysi, as carrying the marks of their own relationship; and the"
19728,SECT. X.,reader will find in Dr. Donaldson’s New Cratylus[912] the various
19729,SECT. X.,indications recorded by ancient writers of the extension of the Medians
19730,SECT. X.,"over Northern Egypt: namely, from Herodotus (v. 9), Pliny (Hist. Nat."
19731,SECT. X.,"vi. 7), and Diodorus (ii. 43). The last of these authors recognises"
19732,SECT. X.,the similarity of tongue between Greeks and Hyperboreans (ii. 47):
19733,SECT. X.,"and Clemens Alexandrinus, after reciting a series of inventions which"
19734,SECT. X.,"the Greeks owed to the barbarians, records among them the saying of"
19735,SECT. X.,"Anacharsis, whom some of the Greeks placed among their ‘seven wise"
19736,SECT. X.,"men,’ and adds ἐμοὶ δὲ πάντες Ἕλληνες Σκυθίζουσι[913]."
19737,SECT. X.,
19738,SECT. X.,"And again, Herodotus (i. 125) gives us a list of names belonging to the"
19739,SECT. X.,"different tribes of Persia: the Persia, that is to say, of his own day."
19740,SECT. X.,"Six of these are settled or agricultural, and four nomad. Of the six,"
19741,SECT. X.,the Pasargadæ are the first. Then come the Μαράφιοι and Μάσπιοι. Three
19742,SECT. X.,"more follow, of whom one is named Γερμάνιοι. The precise correspondence"
19743,SECT. X.,of name immediately suggests that the modern Germans derive their
19744,SECT. X.,appellation from this Persian tribe. But it is customary to derive that
19745,SECT. X.,"name from _wehr_ and _man_, or from _heer_ and _man_, thus giving it a"
19746,SECT. X.,"military sense: and it is also observed[914] that, if it had borne this"
19747,SECT. X.,"sense in the time of Herodotus, he would probably have assigned to it a"
19748,SECT. X.,"higher place in his list. But he does not give us to understand, that"
19749,SECT. X.,he means to point out these tribal names as being the descriptive names
19750,SECT. X.,"of the various classes in one and the same homogeneous community, or"
19751,SECT. X.,"as having, in any degree, the character of caste. To the first three,"
19752,SECT. X.,"indeed, he assigns a political supremacy: for they were the tribes by"
19753,SECT. X.,whose means Cyrus effected his designs. But the idea of particular
19754,SECT. X.,"employments, and social duties, does not seem to belong even to these,"
19755,SECT. X.,and there is no sign of it with the others. It may have been that the
19756,SECT. X.,"Γερμάνιοι meant martial, as Κεφάλληνες seems to have meant Head or"
19757,SECT. X.,"Chief Hellenes, and yet that, as the latter were not the chiefs of all"
19758,SECT. X.,"the Hellenes, so the former were not the soldiery of all Persia. Again,"
19759,SECT. X.,"as the Δωριέες of Homer lay undistinguished in the Hellenic mass,"
19760,SECT. X.,"yet afterwards, and on the very same arena, attained to a long-lived"
19761,SECT. X.,"supremacy, so, and yet more naturally, may it have happened that a"
19762,SECT. X.,"tribe, secondary in Persia itself, may have taken or acquired the lead"
19763,SECT. X.,"in a northward and westward migration from it, and may have given its"
19764,SECT. X.,"name to the people, which afterwards coagulated (so to speak) around"
19765,SECT. X.,that migration.
19766,SECT. X.,
19767,SECT. X.,_Traces in Homer of the Persian name._
19768,SECT. X.,
19769,SECT. X.,There are not wanting either Homeric or post-Homeric traces of a
19770,SECT. X.,"connection between early Greece and Persia. In Homer, Perseus, father"
19771,SECT. X.,"of a line of Peloponnesian kings, is the son of Jupiter and Danae[915]."
19772,SECT. X.,A son of Nestor bears the same name[916]. We have also the name
19773,SECT. X.,"Περσεφόνεια, wife of Aidoneus or Pluto, and Perse, daughter of Oceanus,"
19774,SECT. X.,"who bears Circe and Æetes to Ἠέλιος, the Sun[917]."
19775,SECT. X.,
19776,SECT. X.,"When Homer makes Perseus the son of Jupiter, he certainly implies of"
19777,SECT. X.,"this sovereign, as of Minos, that he had no known paternal ancestry,"
19778,SECT. X.,"and perhaps that he falsely claimed a maternal one, in the country"
19779,SECT. X.,"where he attained to fame. But further, it very decidedly appears from"
19780,SECT. X.,"the use of the word Ἀργεῖοι for the subjects of the Perseids, and from"
19781,SECT. X.,"the intense attachment of the Homeric Juno to that family, that they"
19782,SECT. X.,"were an Hellenic house, following upon the probably Egyptian dynasty of"
19783,SECT. X.,the Danaids. With them appears to begin what Homer esteems to be the
19784,SECT. X.,really national history. Perseus therefore probably may have brought
19785,SECT. X.,his name direct from among the Hellenes of the north. Why should it not
19786,SECT. X.,have come to the Helli from Persia? Let it be recollected that we have
19787,SECT. X.,"two other links with the east supplied: one in Perse, daughter of the"
19788,SECT. X.,"Eastern Oceanus, and bride of the Sun, the other in Persephoneia, whose"
19789,SECT. X.,"ἄλσεα, as I hope to show in treating of the Outer Geography, are in the"
19790,SECT. X.,same quarter.
19791,SECT. X.,
19792,SECT. X.,"In Herodotus we find a tradition that Perseus visited Cepheus[918],"
19793,SECT. X.,"the Persian king, at the period when the people were called by the"
19794,SECT. X.,"Greeks Cephenes; that he married his daughter Andromeda, and had"
19795,SECT. X.,"a son, Perses, who remained behind him, succeeded Cepheus, and"
19796,SECT. X.,gave his name to the country. This tale has the appearance of a
19797,SECT. X.,"palpable fiction, intended to cover what may have been a fact; that"
19798,SECT. X.,Perseus--who in Homer has himself all the appearance of an immigrant
19799,SECT. X.,"into Peloponnesus--was a stranger, and derived his name from that of"
19800,SECT. X.,the Persians. Now this was the version current among the Persians;
19801,SECT. X.,"who reported that Perseus, born one of themselves, became an Hellene,"
19802,SECT. X.,but that his ancestors had not been Hellenes. To this Persian account
19803,SECT. X.,Herodotus appears to give his own adhesion: and he states that the
19804,SECT. X.,"Greeks reckoned Hellenic kings up to Perseus[919], but that before"
19805,SECT. X.,him they were Egyptian. This is in entire harmony with what can be
19806,SECT. X.,"gathered from the indirect, but consistent and converging, notices"
19807,SECT. X.,"supplied by Homer. And again, the whole mass of the later reports"
19808,SECT. X.,concerning Perseus keep him in close relation with that outer circle
19809,SECT. X.,"of traditions, which I have designated as Phœnician; with the Gorgons"
19810,SECT. X.,"of Hades, with Tartessus on the Ocean, with Æthiopia and Atlas."
19811,SECT. X.,"Lastly; the continuance of the name as a royal name, down to the very"
19812,SECT. X.,extinction of nationality in Greece--for the last Macedonian king was
19813,SECT. X.,"a Perseus--may probably be connected with a stream of tradition, that"
19814,SECT. X.,drew from Persia the oldest of the national monarchs.
19815,SECT. X.,
19816,SECT. X.,_The Achæan name in Persia._
19817,SECT. X.,
19818,SECT. X.,"Again, we find that the name Ἀχαιοὶ was the great descriptive name of"
19819,SECT. X.,the Hellic races in the Homeric age. Yet it is without any note of
19820,SECT. X.,"an Hellic or European origin. Let us therefore see, whether in the"
19821,SECT. X.,"East we can find anything that stands, even though at first sight"
19822,SECT. X.,"disguisedly, in affinity with it. Now Herodotus tells us, that in the"
19823,SECT. X.,"leading tribe of Pasargadæ there was a family (φρήτρη), from which"
19824,SECT. X.,came the Persian kings; the family of the Ἀχαιμενίδαι. Even if it
19825,SECT. X.,"were not easy to trace the mode of the relationship, it would seem"
19826,SECT. X.,"inevitable to recognise a connection between the name Ἀχαιμένης, or"
19827,SECT. X.,"whatever is the proper Persian root of this Greek patronymic, and those"
19828,SECT. X.,Ἀχαιοὶ whom we find at the head of the Greek races. This connection
19829,SECT. X.,"receives a singular illustration from Strabo, who in describing the"
19830,SECT. X.,"Asiatic country called Aria, which gives a name to the Arian race,"
19831,SECT. X.,"states that it has three cities called after their founders, Artacaena,"
19832,SECT. X.,"Alexandria, and Achaia. Artacaes was a distinguished Persian, of the"
19833,SECT. X.,army of Xerxes. The name of Alexander speaks for itself. With respect
19834,SECT. X.,"to either of these, Strabo may be understood to speak of what may, from"
19835,SECT. X.,"the respective dates, have been genuine historical traditions. But he"
19836,SECT. X.,"knew and could know nothing of a Persian Achæus, as the founder of the"
19837,SECT. X.,"third city. And the Greek Achæus, if he existed at all, belonged to"
19838,SECT. X.,"another country, and to a pre-historic antiquity. The real force of"
19839,SECT. X.,the tradition which reports that these cities bore the names of their
19840,SECT. X.,"founders, seems, however, to be pretty obvious. It must surely mean"
19841,SECT. X.,this: that they had borne the same names at all times within the memory
19842,SECT. X.,"of man. Thus we have the Achæan name thrown back, by a local testimony"
19843,SECT. X.,"subsisting in Strabo’s time, to a remote antiquity: there it finds a"
19844,SECT. X.,holding-ground in the Achæmenidæ of Herodotus: and both these authors
19845,SECT. X.,"become witnesses, I think, to the derivation of the Ἀχαιοὶ of Homer"
19846,SECT. X.,"from Persia[920]. I do not mean that the Achæmenes, who, according to"
19847,SECT. X.,"the Behistun Inscription, gave his name to the Achæmenidæ, was the"
19848,SECT. X.,"father of the Achæans of the poems, for he appears to have lived only"
19849,SECT. X.,five generations before Darius. But the coincidence of name between
19850,SECT. X.,"the ruling family in Persia, and the dominant race in Greece, bears"
19851,SECT. X.,"witness, in harmony with other testimonies, to a presumptive identity"
19852,SECT. X.,of origin.
19853,SECT. X.,
19854,SECT. X.,"It appears, too, that the name thus viewed may well have had its root"
19855,SECT. X.,"in the ancient Arian language, if we judge from its extant forms."
19856,SECT. X.,"The word signifying ‘friends,’ according to Sir H. Rawlinson, is in"
19857,SECT. X.,"Sanscrit _sakhá_, and in Persian _hakhá_."
19858,SECT. X.,
19859,SECT. X.,"“The name Achæmenes signifies ‘friendly,’ or ‘possessing friends,’"
19860,SECT. X.,"being formed of a Persian word _hakhá_, corresponding to the Sanscrit"

19864,SECT. X.,"The word, then, if we may rely on this high authority, undergoes no"
19865,SECT. X.,"other change, on passing into the Greek tongue, than the loss of the"
19866,SECT. X.,"initial aspirate, (while the second is retained in χ,) and the addition"
19867,SECT. X.,of the Greek termination ος or ιος. In this description of a ruling
19868,SECT. X.,"race by their common bond as associates, there is something that"
19869,SECT. X.,resembles the European and feudal name of peers.
19870,SECT. X.,
19871,SECT. X.,"There is indeed another name still existing in Persia, that of the"
19872,SECT. X.,"Eelliats or itinerant tribes, the form of which, and the circumstances"
19873,SECT. X.,"under which it appears, will shortly be noticed[922]."
19874,SECT. X.,
19875,SECT. X.,"We have now obtained various lights, which point out to us the Persians"
19876,SECT. X.,"as the probable ancestry of the Greeks. It still remains to learn,"
19877,SECT. X.,whether from the history of ancient Persia we can raise a presumption
19878,SECT. X.,"that there were, through resemblances subsisting there, marked signs of"
19879,SECT. X.,affinity between the two.
19880,SECT. X.,
19881,SECT. X.,_The Persians according to Herodotus._
19882,SECT. X.,
19883,SECT. X.,"Herodotus has given us a remarkable, and apparently a careful, account"
19884,SECT. X.,"of the ancient Persians, both as to religion and as to manners, which"
19885,SECT. X.,"upon the whole both exhibits striking points of resemblance to Greece,"
19886,SECT. X.,and likewise tends to attach that resemblance to the Hellic rather than
19887,SECT. X.,the Pelasgian race.
19888,SECT. X.,
19889,SECT. X.,"In making the comparison, we must allow specially for two sources of"
19890,SECT. X.,error. The Hellic tribes of Homer’s time had been probably for not
19891,SECT. X.,less than eight or ten generations (since we trace the Dardanians on
19892,SECT. X.,"their own ground for seven generations, the Perseids and Æolids for"
19893,SECT. X.,"six) detached from the parent stock, and might well have modified their"
19894,SECT. X.,"character and customs, especially since they had mingled with the"
19895,SECT. X.,"Pelasgians in the plains. And again, the account of Herodotus is later"
19896,SECT. X.,"probably by 500 years or more, than the manners described in Homer. The"
19897,SECT. X.,"Persians of his day had long been mixed with the Medes: and had, as he"
19898,SECT. X.,"tells us[923], adopted their costume: probably much else along with it."
19899,SECT. X.,
19900,SECT. X.,_The comparison as to religious belief._
19901,SECT. X.,
19902,SECT. X.,"The Persians, says Herodotus[924], have no temples, altars, nor statues"
19903,SECT. X.,of the gods. Tacitus[925] gives a like account of the Germans. Of these
19904,SECT. X.,Homer only enables us to trace altars with clearness as having been
19905,SECT. X.,adopted by the Hellenic races at the period of the _Troica_. But the
19906,SECT. X.,tendency to sacerdotal development among the Pelasgi may have had its
19907,SECT. X.,counterpart in ‘the symbolism and complicated ceremonial of Media[926].’
19908,SECT. X.,
19909,SECT. X.,They worship Jupiter from high places. So did Hector. We have no reason
19910,SECT. X.,to make the same assertion of the Trojans generally: but the place
19911,SECT. X.,"given to Jupiter on Ida, and the whole Olympian fabric, probably also"
19912,SECT. X.,"the plan of scaling heaven by heaping mountains one on another, all"
19913,SECT. X.,belong to the same train of thought.
19914,SECT. X.,
19915,SECT. X.,"They, if we are to adopt the statement, call the whole circuit of the"
19916,SECT. X.,"heaven by the name of Jupiter. This same is the share of the universe,"
19917,SECT. X.,"which, in the Homeric mythology, falls to the lot of Jupiter, and the"
19918,SECT. X.,"name Ζεὺς is said to be identical with the Sanscrit _Dyaus_, meaning"
19919,SECT. X.,‘the sky[927]:’ a sense which we find in the _sub dio_ and _sub Jove_
19920,SECT. X.,"of the Latin writers, belonging to the Augustan age. This elemental"
19921,SECT. X.,"conception of him, however, is probably more Median than Persian."
19922,SECT. X.,
19923,SECT. X.,They did not originally worship Venus (ἀρχῆθεν); but they learned the
19924,SECT. X.,"worship of her from others, apparently the Medes or Assyrians. This"
19925,SECT. X.,"remarkably accords with the case of the Hellenes of Homer, who seem"
19926,SECT. X.,"only to have been drawing towards, rather than to have accepted fully,"
19927,SECT. X.,the worship of Venus in his time[928].
19928,SECT. X.,
19929,SECT. X.,They considered fire to be a god[929]: differing in this from the
19930,SECT. X.,"Egyptians, who held it to be an animal."
19931,SECT. X.,
19932,SECT. X.,So we find that the worship of Vulcan appears to be Hellic more than
19933,SECT. X.,"Pelasgian, and that the fable of his origin distinctly points to what"
19934,SECT. X.,was for Homer the farthest east[930].
19935,SECT. X.,
19936,SECT. X.,They paid a particular reverence to rivers[931]. Of this we have the
19937,SECT. X.,"amplest evidence in Homer among the Greeks as to Alpheus, Spercheus,"
19938,SECT. X.,"and the River of Scheria: rivers, too, were honoured by a more distinct"
19939,SECT. X.,personification than was attributed to other natural objects. The
19940,SECT. X.,"Scamander is, indeed, similarly treated. But this is an exception"
19941,SECT. X.,to the general mode of representation: and no other Trojan River is
19942,SECT. X.,actively personified[932]. Simois is addressed (Il. xxi. 308) by
19943,SECT. X.,Scamander; but is himself a mute.
19944,SECT. X.,
19945,SECT. X.,"These, however, are particular points: let us also consider more at"
19946,SECT. X.,large the general outline which Herodotus has given us of the Persian
19947,SECT. X.,religion.
19948,SECT. X.,
19949,SECT. X.,"They did not, he says, consider as the Greeks did that the gods were"
19950,SECT. X.,(ἀνθρωποφυέας) anthropophuistic[933]. They called the entire circle
19951,SECT. X.,of heaven by the name of Jupiter. They originally worshipped no gods
19952,SECT. X.,"except the sun, the moon, the earth, fire, water, and the winds."
19953,SECT. X.,Afterwards they learned from the Assyrians and Arabians to worship
19954,SECT. X.,Οὐρανίη under the name of Mitra.
19955,SECT. X.,
19956,SECT. X.,I shall not attempt in this place to discuss the difficult subject of
19957,SECT. X.,the Persian or Magian religions as they are in themselves; farther than
19958,SECT. X.,"to observe, that they appear to have been different. Here we have only"
19959,SECT. X.,"to consider the relation, if any, between that system which the sketch"
19960,SECT. X.,"by Herodotus describes, and the religion of heroic Greece."
19961,SECT. X.,
19962,SECT. X.,"It appears that the religion of the Persians[934], either as anterior"
19963,SECT. X.,"to, or as independent of that of Zoroaster and the Magi, embraced, (1)"
19964,SECT. X.,"the belief in one Supreme and incorporeal God, and (2) the worship of"
19965,SECT. X.,the host of heaven.
19966,SECT. X.,
19967,SECT. X.,The sketch of Herodotus appears to be a representation of this
19968,SECT. X.,"religion: it contains no evidence of dualism, and fire-worship appears"
19969,SECT. X.,in it only as a subordinate characteristic. Only it would appear as
19970,SECT. X.,if the historian had reflected upon Persia the leading idea of the
19971,SECT. X.,"Greek mythology, namely, that which invested Jupiter, as the supreme"
19972,SECT. X.,"deity, especially with the charge of the sky and atmosphere: and that"
19973,SECT. X.,"when he says the Persians call the heavens Jupiter, he probably means"
19974,SECT. X.,"that they consider the Supreme Being not to be circumscribed, but"
19975,SECT. X.,to pervade all space. The powers of outward Nature were doubtless
19976,SECT. X.,"worshipped by them, in the first instance, as organs of the Supreme"
19977,SECT. X.,Being.
19978,SECT. X.,
19979,SECT. X.,"In this sketch there is something to remind us of a primitive religion,"
19980,SECT. X.,or at least to suggest the traditional forms in which that religion was
19981,SECT. X.,"conveyed: it teaches the unity of God, and then steps only into the"
19982,SECT. X.,most natural and proximate form of deviation. It is well called by Dr.
19983,SECT. X.,Döllinger ‘a monotheism with polytheistic elements[935].’
19984,SECT. X.,
19985,SECT. X.,"It is unlike the Homeric religion, inasmuch as it does not contain any"
19986,SECT. X.,"evidences of traditive derivation nearly so abundant or so specific as,"
19987,SECT. X.,"I think, we shall find manifest in the Homeric system[936]. But then we"
19988,SECT. X.,"must remember that it is junior, by many centuries, to the system of"
19989,SECT. X.,"Homer: and that these evidences had become far less palpable, at the"
19990,SECT. X.,"epoch when Herodotus lived, in the contemporary religion of Greece."
19991,SECT. X.,
19992,SECT. X.,"On the other hand, with respect to its human, inventive, and"
19993,SECT. X.,"polytheistic element, it is evidently akin to the Homeric religion;"
19994,SECT. X.,"under which Nature is everywhere animated and uplifted, and teems"
19995,SECT. X.,at every pore with some expression of divinity. The Greek scheme is
19996,SECT. X.,"indeed still more human, (for it takes everywhere the human dress,)"
19997,SECT. X.,"more poetical and imaginative, than the Persian one; but the generative"
19998,SECT. X.,"principle is one and the same, namely, the impersonation, though not"
19999,SECT. X.,"necessarily in both cases alike under human conditions, of all powers"
20000,SECT. X.,observed and felt in outward nature. The whole group may well remind
20001,SECT. X.,"us, both in letter and in spirit, of the invocation of Agamemnon,"
20002,SECT. X.,"which after Jupiter enumerates the sun, the rivers, and the earth:"
20003,SECT. X.,though it also adds the infernal gods[937]. We find from another place
20004,SECT. X.,"in Herodotus, that he knew the Persians to believe in an infernal"
20005,SECT. X.,"deity, to whom they offered human sacrifices[938]."
20006,SECT. X.,
20007,SECT. X.,"If we conceive the Persians moving westward, and gathering mental"
20008,SECT. X.,"and imaginative, as well as warlike and political energy, on their"
20009,SECT. X.,"way, we shall see that they are only enlarging the scheme reported in"
20010,SECT. X.,"Herodotus by a consistent application of its principles, and following"
20011,SECT. X.,"them out in an imaginative and dramatic spirit to their results, when"
20012,SECT. X.,"they people every meadow, wood, and fountain with deity, and when"
20013,SECT. X.,"they construct the great Olympian court for heaven, with its several"
20014,SECT. X.,"reflections; in the sea, around the throne of Nereus, and, in the"
20015,SECT. X.,"nether world, under the gloomy sway of Aidoneus and Persephone."
20016,SECT. X.,
20017,SECT. X.,_As to ritual and other resemblances._
20018,SECT. X.,
20019,SECT. X.,Herodotus[939] also gives us a sketch of the Persian system as to
20020,SECT. X.,"ritual. Each person sacrificed for himself: without libation, music,"
20021,SECT. X.,"garlands, or cakes: only in a becoming spot, and having the tiara"
20022,SECT. X.,wreathed usually with myrtle. When he had performed the essential part
20023,SECT. X.,"of the function, a _Magus_ recited a religious chant; and no one could"
20024,SECT. X.,perform sacrifice except in presence of a _Magus_. It is plain that we
20025,SECT. X.,"see here, if not, as Mr. Blakesley thinks[940], the confusion, at any"
20026,SECT. X.,"rate the combination, of the genuine Persian with the Median ritual."
20027,SECT. X.,"The presence of the Magian was required, or let us suppose that it was"
20028,SECT. X.,simply usual: yet he did not offer the sacrifice. This was perhaps
20029,SECT. X.,"the compromise between the sacerdotal system of the Pelasgians, and"
20030,SECT. X.,"the independent or patriarchal principle of the Hellenes, who exhibit"
20031,SECT. X.,"to us first ὑποφῆται, then μάντιες and θυοσκόοι, but who seem to know"
20032,SECT. X.,"nothing, as among themselves, of priests."
20033,SECT. X.,
20034,SECT. X.,"Like the Hellic races, the Persians of old were remarkable for personal"
20035,SECT. X.,"modesty. They did not practice any unnatural vice, until they learned"
20036,SECT. X.,it from Greece[941]. They placed an extremely high value on their own
20037,SECT. X.,"race, which they esteemed far before all others[942]. Different social"
20038,SECT. X.,relations among those who were intimate were marked by differences in
20039,SECT. X.,"the kiss[943]. Equals kissed with the mouths, unequals by the mouth"
20040,SECT. X.,of one on the cheek of the other: while persons greatly inferior fell
20041,SECT. X.,"prostrate. In the Odyssey, Ulysses kisses his son Telemachus (doubtless"
20042,SECT. X.,"on the face) (Od. xvi. 190), and Penelope kisses Telemachus on the head"
20043,SECT. X.,"and eyes (xvii. 39); but Ulysses kisses the king of Egypt, when he is"
20044,SECT. X.,"a suppliant (xiv. 279) on the knees, and the slave Dolius on the hands"
20045,SECT. X.,"(xxiv. 398): he kisses Eumæus and Philœtius on the head and hands,"
20046,SECT. X.,"while they embrace, but do not kiss him (xxi. 224, 5). Dolius held the"
20047,SECT. X.,"hand, and no more, of Ulysses. But the chief is kissed on the head and"
20048,SECT. X.,eyes by his grandmother (Od. xix. 417.)
20049,SECT. X.,
20050,SECT. X.,"Like the Greeks, the Persians shore the hair in mourning. They held"
20051,SECT. X.,lying to be the most disgraceful of all things. It was also disgraceful
20052,SECT. X.,"to be called a woman[944]. Again, the Persians in the time of Crœsus"
20053,SECT. X.,"were highlanders[945], destitute of all the comforts of life, just"
20054,SECT. X.,as Achilles describes the Helli round Dodona. Like the καρηκομόωντες
20055,SECT. X.,"Ἀχαιοὶ, they wore their hair long[946]."
20056,SECT. X.,
20057,SECT. X.,"All these are points of similarity. Upon the other hand, there are"
20058,SECT. X.,"two points of discrepancy, which may be noticed. The Persians had many"
20059,SECT. X.,wives and concubines: and they did not burn their dead. Upon the first
20060,SECT. X.,"of these points of discrepancy with the Greeks, the Persians were in"
20061,SECT. X.,"harmony with, at least, the ruling race of Troas; and polygamy must"
20062,SECT. X.,"always be an affair of ruling races, or of a select few."
20063,SECT. X.,
20064,SECT. X.,A fragment of the old historian Xanthus[947] would lead us to suppose
20065,SECT. X.,"that they derived this habit from the Medes, who, according to that"
20066,SECT. X.,"author, had no law of incest, and freely exchanged their wives."
20067,SECT. X.,
20068,SECT. X.,"On the second point, they differed from Troy: for the Trojans, like the"
20069,SECT. X.,"Greeks, burned their dead."
20070,SECT. X.,
20071,SECT. X.,It was also the Persian custom to introduce women to their
20072,SECT. X.,"banquets[948]. There is, however, a trace of this last-named practice"
20073,SECT. X.,"at least in the Olympian banquets of Homer. And it is plain that Arete,"
20074,SECT. X.,"the queen of Alcinous, was at the Phæacian banquet (Od. vii. 49, 50,"
20075,SECT. X.,"147, 8): but this may have been due to the unusual honour in which she"
20076,SECT. X.,was held (Od. vii. 67). More ordinarily the Greek women do not appear
20077,SECT. X.,at meals with men.
20078,SECT. X.,
20079,SECT. X.,Thus far we seem to be carried by the text of Herodotus standing alone.
20080,SECT. X.,"And it should be borne in mind, that Ctesias, as he is reported in"
20081,SECT. X.,"Photius[949], though he condemns Herodotus as a teller of untruth, and"
20082,SECT. X.,"contradicts him in his narrative, does not question his account of"
20083,SECT. X.,religion and manners.
20084,SECT. X.,
20085,SECT. X.,_Evidence of the Behistun Inscription._
20086,SECT. X.,
20087,SECT. X.,But the discovery and deciphering by Rawlinson of the Behistun
20088,SECT. X.,"Inscription throws an additional light upon this question, and one"
20089,SECT. X.,highly confirmatory of the general conclusions towards which we have
20090,SECT. X.,"tended. The Magian, called Smerdis[950] by Herodotus, appears in this"
20091,SECT. X.,"Inscription under the name of Gomates: and it is now demonstrated,"
20092,SECT. X.,"that the revolution which he wrought, or of which he took advantage,"
20093,SECT. X.,"and which was reversed by Darius, was religious as well as political."
20094,SECT. X.,"For, says the Inscription, ‘when Cambyses had proceeded to Egypt, the"
20095,SECT. X.,state became irreligious.’ It is then related that Gomates obtained
20096,SECT. X.,"the empire. But, says Darius, ‘I adored Ormuzd. Ormuzd brought me"
20097,SECT. X.,"aid.’ ‘Then did I, with faithful men, slay Gomates the Magian.... By"
20098,SECT. X.,the grace of Ormuzd I became king. Ormuzd gave me the empire.... The
20099,SECT. X.,rites which Gomates the Magian had introduced I prohibited. I restored
20100,SECT. X.,"the chants, and the worship, to the State, and to those families,"
20101,SECT. X.,which Gomates the Magian had deprived of them.’ Thus Darius represents
20102,SECT. X.,"in this great transaction the Persian party and its religion, as"
20103,SECT. X.,against the Medians and the Magi. Hence arises a direct presumption
20104,SECT. X.,"that the Magi were properly a Median class, and were adopted into the"
20105,SECT. X.,"Persian system, only in consequence of the connection and political"
20106,SECT. X.,amalgamation of the Persians with the Medes.
20107,SECT. X.,
20108,SECT. X.,"Again, in a political point of view, we have the Persians clearly"
20109,SECT. X.,"exhibited as standing in the same relation to the Medes, which the"
20110,SECT. X.,Helli held to the Pelasgi. The needy highlanders[951] come down upon
20111,SECT. X.,and overpower the richer and more advanced inhabitants of the central
20112,SECT. X.,"valleys: under the Magian upstart, the latter take advantage of"
20113,SECT. X.,"the absence of the sovereign to rebel, but they are, after a short"
20114,SECT. X.,"interval, finally put down."
20115,SECT. X.,
20116,SECT. X.,_The political system of Darius._
20117,SECT. X.,
20118,SECT. X.,"Darius, having obtained the throne, and established the Persian"
20119,SECT. X.,"supremacy, proceeded to organize the empire; and he appears to have"
20120,SECT. X.,displayed in this great sphere the same thoroughly political mind
20121,SECT. X.,"as the Hellenic races exhibited in their diminutive, but still"
20122,SECT. X.,"extraordinary polities. He divided the empire by a cadastral system,"
20123,SECT. X.,under provincial governors; and he established everywhere fixed rates
20124,SECT. X.,of tribute. These were great departures from the old Greek form of
20125,SECT. X.,sovereignty: but we are now five centuries later than the heroic age:
20126,SECT. X.,"and, besides, we must remember that the paternal and everywhere fixed"
20127,SECT. X.,"forms of government, which will suffice for very small states, are"
20128,SECT. X.,"not always applicable to large ones. Yet, as we learn from Herodotus,"
20129,SECT. X.,"the innovations of Darius were much resented by the Persians, who"
20130,SECT. X.,"under Cyrus, and even under Cambyses, knew nothing of fixed rates of"
20131,SECT. X.,"taxation, but offered benevolences (δῶρα) to the throne[952]; and a"
20132,SECT. X.,"saying came into vogue, that Cyrus was a father, Cambyses an autocrat"
20133,SECT. X.,"(δεσπότης), and Darius a tradesman (κάπηλος)."
20134,SECT. X.,
20135,SECT. X.,"‘Landlord of England art thou now, not King[953].’"
20136,SECT. X.,
20137,SECT. X.,We seem to have here an emphatic testimony to the original identity of
20138,SECT. X.,"the Persian and Hellic, or Hellenic ideas of government."
20139,SECT. X.,
20140,SECT. X.,"It is also worthy of remark, that in the case of Minos, who seems"
20141,SECT. X.,"to have held a large and disjointed empire, we have traditional,"
20142,SECT. X.,and even Homeric indications of some proceeding not wholly unlike
20143,SECT. X.,"this of Darius. For this prince, according to Thucydides, governed"
20144,SECT. X.,"the islands through his sons, that is, by a provincial organization"
20145,SECT. X.,under local officers[954]; in Homer we find Rhadamanthus acting at a
20146,SECT. X.,"distance, probably on his behalf; and we may perhaps hence conceive,"
20147,SECT. X.,"that there was truth in the tradition, afterwards so odious, that he"
20148,SECT. X.,imposed tribute upon the then Pelasgian Attica. Minos indeed was a
20149,SECT. X.,reputed Phœnician: but in Homer the Phœnician and Persian traditions
20150,SECT. X.,"are closely combined, and the poet appears to have treated Phœnicia as"
20151,SECT. X.,"the medium, perhaps even the symbol, of much that was Persian. Even"
20152,SECT. X.,geographically I believe that he placed the two countries in very close
20153,SECT. X.,proximity.
20154,SECT. X.,
20155,SECT. X.,"It seems probable also, that we may consider the long continued"
20156,SECT. X.,"application of the term Βασιλεὺς by the Greeks to the Persian kings, as"
20157,SECT. X.,having reference to an original identity of race and manners. It had
20158,SECT. X.,been their own original name for a monarch. When the ancient monarchies
20159,SECT. X.,"passed away, so did the name from their usage; and the possessor of"
20160,SECT. X.,"singlehanded power among the Greeks, having in all cases obtained it by"
20161,SECT. X.,"the suppression of liberty, came to be called τύραννος; but the word"
20162,SECT. X.,"Βασιλεὺς continued to be used with reference to Persia, where the chain"
20163,SECT. X.,"of traditions had not been broken, and where monarchy had never ceased"
20164,SECT. X.,"to prevail; so that there had been no reason for a change of usage,"
20165,SECT. X.,or for a deviation from the ancient respect and reverence towards the
20166,SECT. X.,"possessor of a throne. Again, the traditional throne of Lacedæmon"
20167,SECT. X.,continued to be held by Βασιλεῖς[955].
20168,SECT. X.,
20169,SECT. X.,For the word Βασιλεὺς was one of no ordinary force; and down to a very
20170,SECT. X.,late date it must have been surrounded with venerable recollections.
20171,SECT. X.,"It was borne by the emperors of Constantinople, and even at times"
20172,SECT. X.,"stickled for by them, as a title distinguishing them from the emperors"
20173,SECT. X.,"of the West. Though essentially Greek, it was also written in the"
20174,SECT. X.,"Latin character. Unlike the word _Rex_, it appears never to have been"
20175,SECT. X.,applied to any ruler who exercised a merely derivative power. It
20176,SECT. X.,"travelled so far westward as to our own island: and King Edgar, in a"
20177,SECT. X.,"charter, calls himself _Anglorum Basileus, omniumque Regum, Insularum,"
20178,SECT. X.,"Oceanique Britanniam circumjacentis, cunctarumque nationum, quæ infra"
20179,SECT. X.,"eam includuntur, Imperator et Dominus_[956]."

20181,SECT. X.,_Hellenic traits in modern Persia._
20182,SECT. X.,
20183,SECT. X.,"Even now, after so many centuries of vicissitude, the Persian presents"
20184,SECT. X.,"numerous points of resemblance, perhaps more than we can find in"
20185,SECT. X.,"Modern Greece itself, to the primitive and heroic Greek of Homer."
20186,SECT. X.,"Upon the whole, without doubt, he stands upon a lower level. Lying,"
20187,SECT. X.,"drunkenness, unnatural vice[957], the degradation of women, are all"
20188,SECT. X.,now rife in Persia. But such things were to be expected after so many
20189,SECT. X.,"ages of estrangement from the revealed knowledge of God, of moral"
20190,SECT. X.,"contamination, and of political depression and misgovernment. But"
20191,SECT. X.,"with allowance on these accounts, and on the score of the changes to"
20192,SECT. X.,"Magianism and Mahometanism, the old features are still retained, and"
20193,SECT. X.,they present to our view abundant presumptions of identity.
20194,SECT. X.,
20195,SECT. X.,The Persians[958] are still noted for hospitality and love of display:
20196,SECT. X.,for highly refined manners and great personal beauty. They have still
20197,SECT. X.,"an intense love of poetry, of song, and also of music, while their"
20198,SECT. X.,practice of this art is rude and simple: they still associate poetry
20199,SECT. X.,"(sometimes licentious, as in the Eighth Odyssey) with recitation and"
20200,SECT. X.,"the banquet; and, when Malcolm wrote, printing was still unknown among"
20201,SECT. X.,"the useful arts of the country. They are passionately fond of horses,"
20202,SECT. X.,much given to the chase and to the practice of horse-racing[959]. Men
20203,SECT. X.,"of letters are esteemed, and their society valued, even as in the"
20204,SECT. X.,Odyssey the Bard is among those whom men are accustomed to invite to
20205,SECT. X.,dinner[960]. On the occasion of a marriage they celebrate prolonged
20206,SECT. X.,"feasts of three days for the poor, and from that up to thirty or forty"
20207,SECT. X.,"days for the highest classes. Amidst great depravity, much of filial"
20208,SECT. X.,piety and of maternal influence remains[961]. It is observed that they
20209,SECT. X.,do not usually allude to women by name[962]. There is an approach to
20210,SECT. X.,"this abstinence in the Homeric poems; where names of men, and likewise"
20211,SECT. X.,"of goddesses, in the vocative are frequent, but I am not sure that we"
20212,SECT. X.,have any instances of a woman addressed by her proper name throughout
20213,SECT. X.,the Iliad or Odyssey. But certainly one of the most curious notes of
20214,SECT. X.,"similarity is that, together with their high and refined politeness,"
20215,SECT. X.,"they retain a liability, when under great excitement, to a sort of"
20216,SECT. X.,cannibal ferocity. A recent writer states[963] the following anecdotes.
20217,SECT. X.,"A few years ago, the chieftain of a tribe slew in a feud the chieftain"
20218,SECT. X.,"of another. Shortly afterwards he was attacked while on a journey,"
20219,SECT. X.,"taken after vigorous resistance, and put to death. His heart, if we may"
20220,SECT. X.,"believe the recital, was then roasted, and was eaten by the mother of"
20221,SECT. X.,his former victim. And again; the husband of a beautiful young woman
20222,SECT. X.,"had been slain by a rival chief. The widow, who had been much attached"
20223,SECT. X.,"to the dead warrior, would minutely describe the incidents of the"
20224,SECT. X.,"catastrophe, and then, lifting up her hands to heaven, would pray to"
20225,SECT. X.,"Ali to deliver the murderer into her hands, ‘that having cut out his"
20226,SECT. X.,"heart, I may make it into kibabs, and eat it before I die.’ These are"
20227,SECT. X.,certainly most pointed proofs that Homer has proceeded with his usual
20228,SECT. X.,"veracity, as an observer and chronicler of man, when he shocks us by"
20229,SECT. X.,"making Achilles wish he could eat Hector, and Hecuba wish she could"
20230,SECT. X.,"eat Achilles; nay, even when he yet further proves that this idea was"
20231,SECT. X.,"familiar to his race and age, by making Jupiter tell Juno, she would,"
20232,SECT. X.,"he believes, be well content to eat Priam and all his sons."
20233,SECT. X.,
20234,SECT. X.,_The Eelliats: Media and the Pelasgi._
20235,SECT. X.,
20236,SECT. X.,"To appreciate fully, however, the resemblances of Greek and Persian,"
20237,SECT. X.,we must take the latter as he is found in the military tribes of the
20238,SECT. X.,province of Pars or Fars. The members of these tribes are chiefly
20239,SECT. X.,"horsemen, all soldiers, and all brigands. But they abhor the name and"
20240,SECT. X.,"character of thief; plunder is redeemed by violence in their eyes,"
20241,SECT. X.,and it is evidently accompanied with the practice of a generous and
20242,SECT. X.,delicate hospitality. Elsewhere in Persia many degrading customs
20243,SECT. X.,"prevail, and women are regarded chiefly with a view to sensual use;"
20244,SECT. X.,"but among these military tribes they are more highly valued, and are"
20245,SECT. X.,of remarkable modesty and chastity; yet they have an innocent freedom
20246,SECT. X.,"in their good offices to strangers[964], which at once recalls the"
20247,SECT. X.,Greek maidens of the Odyssey. Adultery is capitally punishable.
20248,SECT. X.,"Alexander the Great endeavoured to bring these tribes to settle, and"
20249,SECT. X.,"to adopt agricultural habits; but they have defied his efforts, and"
20250,SECT. X.,"still remain like the old Helli of the hills, when they hung over"
20251,SECT. X.,"the Pelasgians of the valleys. It is to be observed, that they are"
20252,SECT. X.,particularly mentioned in the Eteo-Persian province of Fars: and
20253,SECT. X.,"further, that they bear the name Eelleat[965], which at least presents"
20254,SECT. X.,a striking resemblance to that of the Helli. The aspirate would pass
20255,SECT. X.,"into the doubled ε, like ἡλιος into ἠελιος, or ἕδνα into ἔεδνα. So"
20256,SECT. X.,Helli is the equivalent of Eelli.
20257,SECT. X.,
20258,SECT. X.,"In sum, the ancient Persians, like the Helli, were of Arian race,"
20259,SECT. X.,"of highland character and habits, inhabitants of a rude country:"
20260,SECT. X.,"apparently children of Japhet, akin closely to the Hellenes, and less"
20261,SECT. X.,palpably to the Osci and Umbri.
20262,SECT. X.,
20263,SECT. X.,"The Medians were _civilly_ in a more advanced stage of social life, and"
20264,SECT. X.,"were possessed of greater wealth, but endowed with inferior energies."
20265,SECT. X.,They are presumed by many to have been of the race of Ham: to have
20266,SECT. X.,"peopled Egypt, and to be akin to the ancient Sicani, to the Basques,"
20267,SECT. X.,"the Esthonians, the Lapps, and the Finns of modern Europe. For the"
20268,SECT. X.,"purposes of this inquiry, they are to be regarded as in all likelihood"
20269,SECT. X.,the immediate fountain-head of the wide-spread Pelasgian races.
20270,SECT. X.,
20271,SECT. X.,We began under the warning of Mr. Grote: and I fear that we end
20272,SECT. X.,"under the implied ban of another very able and recent writer, Dr."
20273,SECT. X.,Latham[966]. He considers that we have been put in possession of no
20274,SECT. X.,"facts with respect to the Pelasgi more than those three, so slight and"
20275,SECT. X.,"so incapable of effective combination, which are recognised by Mr."
20276,SECT. X.,"Grote[967]. But the principle he lays down is that, by which I wish"
20277,SECT. X.,"to be tried. He says, the scholar finds a ποῦ στῶ in the _dictum_ of"
20278,SECT. X.,"this or that author, but the sound ethnologist ‘on the last testified"
20279,SECT. X.,fact:’ he demands for his basis ‘the existing state of things as either
20280,SECT. X.,"known to ourselves, or known to contemporaries capable of learning them"
20281,SECT. X.,at the period nearest the time under consideration.’ It appears to me
20282,SECT. X.,"that the text of Homer, so far as it goes, answers this demand: that"
20283,SECT. X.,"his accounts of Pelasgian, Hellene, and Achæan, when we can get at"
20284,SECT. X.,"them, and when we take into view his epoch and means of information,"
20285,SECT. X.,come clearly within the meaning of ‘testified facts’ in regard to that
20286,SECT. X.,"particular subject matter. I admit that, from their incidental and"
20287,SECT. X.,"often unconscious nature, there is a great liability to error in the"
20288,SECT. X.,"attempt to elicit them: but my assertion is, that the ground under foot"
20289,SECT. X.,"is sound; and that, though we may go astray while travelling it, yet we"
20290,SECT. X.,are not attempting to tread upon a quicksand. As to the success with
20291,SECT. X.,"which this principle has here been applied, I am not too sanguine; but"
20292,SECT. X.,"I contend earnestly for the principle itself, because I believe that it"
20293,SECT. X.,"will, when admitted, legitimately work out its own results, and that"
20294,SECT. X.,they will make no unimportant addition to the primary facts of that
20295,SECT. X.,"great branch of philosophy, the history, and most of all the early"
20296,SECT. X.,"history, of man."

20478,ADDENDA.,His conclusions are;
20479,ADDENDA.,
20480,ADDENDA.,"1. That the Greek and mid-Italian languages correspond, in what touches"
20481,ADDENDA.,the rudiments of the material life of man.
20482,ADDENDA.,
20483,ADDENDA.,"2. That in the higher region of the mind, of religion, and of advanced"
20484,ADDENDA.,"polity, this correspondence wholly fails."
20485,ADDENDA.,
20486,ADDENDA.,3. That the Græco-Italic agrees with the Sanscrit down to the pastoral
20487,ADDENDA.,"stage of society only, and ceases with the commencement of the"
20488,ADDENDA.,agricultural and settled stage.
20489,ADDENDA.,
20490,ADDENDA.,4. That the abstract genius of the Roman religion bears a relation
20491,ADDENDA.,"to the Greek anthropophuism, like that of the full-formed Indian"
20492,ADDENDA.,mythology to the metaphysical scheme of the Zendavesta.

20530,ADDENDA.,P. 313. The statement as to the persons slain by Hector and Mars is
20531,ADDENDA.,"inaccurate. The seven first names are, so far as the text informs us,"
20532,ADDENDA.,"undistinguished, except Teuthras, who is called ἀντίθεος; and among"

20536,ADDENDA.,"and among these, while we have four names of Hellic complexion, Dolops"
