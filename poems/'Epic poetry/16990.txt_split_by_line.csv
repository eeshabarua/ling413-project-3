80,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.","In this book we are to tell the story of Troy, and particularly of the"
81,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.",famous siege which ended in the total destruction of that renowned city.
82,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.","It is a story of brave warriors and heroes of 3000 years ago, about"
83,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.",whose exploits the greatest poets and historians of ancient times have
84,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.",written. Some of the wonderful events of the memorable siege are related
85,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.","in a celebrated poem called the Ilʹi-ad, written in the Greek language."
86,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.","The author of this poem was Hoʹmer, who was the author of another great"
87,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.","poem, the Odʹys-sey, which tells of the voyages and adventures of the"
88,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.","Greek hero, U-lysʹses, after the taking of Troy."
89,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.",
90,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.","Homer has been called the Father of Poetry, because he was the first and"
91,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.",greatest of poets. He lived so long ago that very little is known about
92,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.",him. We do not even know for a certainty when or where he was born. It
93,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.","is believed, however, that he lived in the ninth century before Christ,"
94,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.","and that his native place was Smyrʹna, in Asia Minor. But long after"
95,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.",his death several other cities claimed the honor of being his
96,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.",birthplace.
97,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.",
98,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.","Seven Grecian cities vied for Homer dead,"
99,"I. HOMER, THE FATHER OF POETRY.",Through which the living Homer begged his bread.

101,LEONIDAS.,LEONIDAS.
102,LEONIDAS.,
103,LEONIDAS.,It is perhaps not true that Homer was so poor as to be obliged to beg
104,LEONIDAS.,for his bread; but it is probable that he earned his living by traveling
105,LEONIDAS.,"from city to city through many parts of Greece and Asia Minor, reciting"
106,LEONIDAS.,"his poems in the palaces of princes, and at public assemblies. This was"
107,LEONIDAS.,"one of the customs of ancient times, when the art of writing was either"
108,LEONIDAS.,"not known, or very little practiced. The poets, or bards, of those days"
109,LEONIDAS.,"committed their compositions to memory, and repeated them aloud at"
110,LEONIDAS.,"gatherings of the people, particularly at festivals and athletic games,"
111,LEONIDAS.,of which the ancient Greeks were very fond. At those games prizes and
112,LEONIDAS.,rewards were given to the bards as well as to the athletes.
113,LEONIDAS.,
114,LEONIDAS.,It is said that in the latter part of his life the great poet became
115,LEONIDAS.,"blind, and that this was why he received the name of Homer, which"
116,LEONIDAS.,"signified a blind person. The name first given to him, we are told, was"
117,LEONIDAS.,"Mel-e-sigʹe-nes, from the river Meʹles, a small stream on the banks of"
118,LEONIDAS.,which his native city of Smyrna was situated.
119,LEONIDAS.,
120,LEONIDAS.,"So little being known of Homer's life, there has been much difference of"
121,LEONIDAS.,opinion about him among learned men. Many have believed that Homer never
122,LEONIDAS.,existed. Others have thought that the Iliad and Odyssey were composed
123,LEONIDAS.,"not by one author, but by several. ""Some,"" says the English poet, Walter"
124,LEONIDAS.,"Savage Landor, ""tell us that there were twenty Homers, some deny that"
125,LEONIDAS.,"there was ever one."" Those who believe that there were ""twenty Homers"""
126,LEONIDAS.,think that different parts of the two great poems--the Iliad and
127,LEONIDAS.,"Odyssey--were composed by different persons, and that all the parts were"
128,LEONIDAS.,afterwards put together in the form in which they now appear. The
129,LEONIDAS.,"opinion of most scholars at present, however, is that Homer did really"
130,LEONIDAS.,"exist, that he was a wandering bard, or minstrel, who sang or recited"
131,LEONIDAS.,"verses or ballads composed by himself, about the great deeds of heroes"
132,LEONIDAS.,"and warriors, and that those ballads, collected and arranged in after"
133,LEONIDAS.,"years in two separate books, form the poems known as the Iliad and"
134,LEONIDAS.,Odyssey.
135,LEONIDAS.,
136,LEONIDAS.,"Homer's poetry is what is called epic poetry, that is, it tells about"
137,LEONIDAS.,heroes and heroic actions. The Iliad and Odyssey are the first and
138,LEONIDAS.,"greatest of epic poems. In all ages since Homer's time, scholars have"
139,LEONIDAS.,agreed in declaring them to be the finest poetic productions of human
140,LEONIDAS.,genius. No nation in the world has ever produced poems so beautiful or
141,LEONIDAS.,so perfect. They have been read and admired by learned men for more than
142,LEONIDAS.,2000 years. They have been translated into the languages of all
143,LEONIDAS.,civilized countries. In this book we make many quotations from the fine
144,LEONIDAS.,"translation of the Iliad by our American poet, William Cullen Bryant. We"
145,LEONIDAS.,"quote also from the well-known translation by the English poet,"
146,LEONIDAS.,Alexander Pope.
147,LEONIDAS.,
148,LEONIDAS.,The ancients had a very great admiration for the poetry of Homer. We are
149,LEONIDAS.,told that every educated Greek could repeat from memory any passage in
150,LEONIDAS.,the Iliad or Odyssey. Alexander the Great was so fond of Homer's poems
151,LEONIDAS.,that he always had them under his pillow while he slept. He kept the
152,LEONIDAS.,"Iliad in a richly ornamented casket, saying that ""the most perfect work"
153,LEONIDAS.,of human genius ought to be preserved in a box the most valuable and
154,LEONIDAS.,"precious in the world."""
155,LEONIDAS.,
156,LEONIDAS.,"So great was the veneration the Greeks had for Homer, that they erected"
157,LEONIDAS.,"temples and altars to him, and worshiped him as a god. They held"
158,LEONIDAS.,"festivals in his honor, and made medals bearing the figure of the poet"
159,LEONIDAS.,sitting on a throne and holding in his hands the Iliad and Odyssey. One
160,LEONIDAS.,"of the kings of Eʹgypt built in that country a magnificent temple, in"
161,LEONIDAS.,"which was set up a statue of Homer, surrounded with a beautiful"
162,LEONIDAS.,representation of the seven cities that contended for the honor of being
163,LEONIDAS.,the place of his birth.
164,LEONIDAS.,
165,LEONIDAS.,"Great bard of Greece, whose ever-during verse"
166,LEONIDAS.,"All ages venerate, all tongues rehearse;"
167,LEONIDAS.,Could blind idolatry be justly paid
168,LEONIDAS.,"To aught of mental power by man display'd,"
169,LEONIDAS.,"To thee, thou sire of soul-exalting song,"
170,LEONIDAS.,That boundless worship might to thee belong.

176,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,
177,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,To understand the Story of Troy it is necessary to know something about
178,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"the gods and goddesses, who played so important a part in the events we"
179,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,are to relate. We shall see that in the Troʹjan War nearly everything
180,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"was ordered or directed by a god or goddess. The gods, indeed, had much"
181,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"to do in the causing of the war, and they took sides in the great"
182,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"struggle, some of them helping the Greeks and some helping the Trojans."
183,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,
184,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,The ancient Greeks believed that there were a great many gods. According
185,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"to their religion all parts of the universe,--the heavens and the earth,"
186,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"the sun and the moon, the ocean, seas, and rivers, the mountains and"
187,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"forests, the winds and storms,--were ruled by different gods. The gods,"
188,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"too, it was supposed, controlled all the affairs of human life. There"
189,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"were a god of war and a god of peace, and gods of music, and poetry, and"
190,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"dancing, and hunting, and of all the other arts or occupations in which"
191,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,men engaged.
192,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,
193,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"The gods, it was believed, were in some respects like human beings. In"
194,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,form they usually appeared as men and women. They were passionate and
195,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"vindictive, and often quarreled among themselves. They married and had"
196,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"children, and needed food and drink and sleep. Sometimes they married"
197,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"human beings, and the sons of such marriages were the heroes of"
198,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"antiquity, men of giant strength who performed daring and wonderful"
199,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"feats. The food of the gods was Am-broʹsia, which conferred immortality"
200,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,and perpetual youth on those who partook of it; their drink was a
201,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,delicious wine called Necʹtar.
202,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,
203,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"The gods, then, were immortal beings. They never died; they never grew"
204,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"old, and they possessed immense power. They could change themselves, or"
205,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"human beings, into any form, and they could make themselves visible or"
206,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"invisible at pleasure. They could travel through the skies, or over"
207,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"earth or ocean, with the rapidity of lightning, often riding in gorgeous"
208,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,golden chariots drawn by horses of immortal breed. They were greatly
209,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"feared by men, and when any disaster occurred,--if lives were lost by"
210,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"earthquake, or shipwreck, or any other calamity,--it was attributed to"
211,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,the anger of some god.
212,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,
213,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"Though immortal beings, however, the gods were subject to some of the"
214,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"physical infirmities of humanity. They could not die, but they might be"
215,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,wounded and suffer bodily pain the same as men. They often took part in
216,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"the quarrels and wars of people on earth, and they had weapons and armor"
217,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,like human warriors.
218,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,
219,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,The usual place of residence of the principal gods was on the top of
220,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"Mount O-lymʹpus in Greece. Here they dwelt in golden palaces, and they"
221,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,had a Council Chamber where they frequently feasted together at grand
222,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"banquets, celestial music being rendered by A-polʹlo, the god of"
223,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"minstrelsy, and the Muses, who were the divinities of poetry and song."
224,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,
225,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,In all the chief cities grand temples were erected for the worship of
226,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"the gods. One of the most famous was the Parʹthe-non, at Athens. At the"
227,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"shrines of the gods costly gifts in gold and silver were presented, and"
228,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"on their altars, often built in the open air, beasts were killed and"
229,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"burned as sacrifices, which were thought to be very pleasing to the"
230,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,divine beings to whom they were offered.

236,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"The greatest and most powerful of the gods was Juʹpi-ter, also called"
237,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,Jove or Zeus. To him all the rest were subject. He was the king of the
238,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"gods, the mighty Thunderer, at whose nod Olympus shook, and at whose"

249,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"The wife of Jupiter, and the queen of heaven, was Juʹno, who, as we"
250,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"shall see, was the great enemy of Troy and the Trojans. One of the"
251,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"daughters of Jupiter, called Veʹnus, or Aph-ro-diʹte, was the goddess of"
252,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,beauty and love. Nepʹtune was the god of the sea. He usually carried in
253,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"his hand a trident, or three-pronged scepter, the emblem of his"

262,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"Mars was the god of war, and Pluʹto, also called Dis and Haʹdes, was god"
263,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,of the regions of the dead. One of the most glorious and powerful of the
264,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"gods was Apollo, or Phœʹbus, or Sminʹtheus, for he had many names. He"
265,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"was god of the sun, and of medicine, music, and poetry. He is"
266,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"represented as holding in his hand a bow, and sometimes a lyre. Homer"
267,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"calls him the ""god of the silver bow,"" and the ""far-darting Apollo,"" for"
268,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,the ancients believed that with the dart of his arrow he sent down
269,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,plagues upon men whenever they offended him.

271,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"The other principal deities mentioned by Homer are Mi-nerʹva, or"

273,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"or Herʹmes, the messenger of Jupiter. Vulcan was also the patron, or"
274,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"god, of smiths. He had several forges; one was on Mount Olympus, and"
275,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"another was supposed to be under Mount Ætʹna in Sicʹi-ly. Here, with his"
276,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"giant workmen, the Cyʹclops, he made thunderbolts for Jupiter, and"

281,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"sometimes by appearing on earth under different forms, and speaking"
282,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,directly to kings and warriors. Very often men learned the will of the

284,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,supposed to have the power of foretelling events. There were temples
285,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,also where the gods gave answers through priests. Such answers were
286,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"called Orʹa-cles, and this name was also given to the priests. The most"
287,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,celebrated oracle of ancient times was in the temple of Apollo at
288,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"Delʹphi, in Greece. To this place people came from all parts of the"
289,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"world to consult the god, whose answers were given by a priestess called"
290,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,Pythʹi-a.
291,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,
292,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,The ancients never engaged in war or any other important undertaking
293,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,without sacrificing to the gods or consulting their oracles or
294,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,soothsayers. Before going to battle they made sacrifices to the gods. If
295,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,they were defeated in battle they regarded it as a sign of the anger of
296,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"Jupiter, or Juno, or Minerva, or Apollo, or some of the other great"
297,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"beings who dwelt on Olympus. When making leagues or treaties of peace,"
298,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"they called the gods as witnesses, and prayed to Father Jupiter to send"
299,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,"terrible punishments on any who should take false oaths, or break their"
300,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,promises. In the story of the Trojan War we shall find many examples of
301,II. THE GODS AND GODDESSES.,such appeals to the gods by the chiefs on both sides.

332,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,
333,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,That part of Asia Minor which borders the narrow channel now known as
334,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"the Dar-da-nellesʹ, was in ancient times called Troʹas. Its capital was"
335,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"the city of Troy, which stood about three miles from the shore of the"
336,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"Æ-geʹan Sea, at the foot of Mount Ida, near the junction of two rivers,"
337,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"the Simʹo-is, and the Sca-manʹder or Xanʹthus. The people of Troy and"
338,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,Troas were called Trojans.
339,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,
340,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"Some of the first settlers in northwestern Asia Minor, before it was"
341,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"called Troas, came from Thrace, a country lying to the north of Greece."
342,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,The king of these Thraʹcian colonists was Teuʹcer. During his reign a
343,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,prince named Darʹdanus arrived in the new settlement. He was a son of
344,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"Jupiter, and he came from Samʹo-thrace, one of the many islands of the"
345,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,Ægean Sea. It is said that he escaped from a great flood which swept
346,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"over his native island, and that he was carried on a raft of wood to the"
347,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,coast of the kingdom of Teucer. Soon afterwards he married Teucer's
348,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,daughter. He then built a city for himself amongst the hills of Mount
349,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"Ida, and called it Dar-daʹni-a; and on the death of Teucer he became"
350,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"king of the whole country, to which he gave the same name, Dardania."
351,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,

360,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,
361,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,Dardanus was the ancestor of the Trojan line of kings. He had a grandson
362,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"named Tros, and from him the city Troy, as well as the country Troas,"
363,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,took its name. The successor of King Tros was his son Iʹlus. By him Troy
364,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"was built, and it was therefore also called Ilʹi-um or Ilʹi-on; hence"
365,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"the title of Homer's great poem,--the Iliad. From the names Dardanus"
366,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,and Teucer the city of Troy has also been sometimes called Dardania and
367,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"Teuʹcri-a, and the Trojans are often referred to as Dardanians and"
368,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"Teucrians. Ilus was succeeded by his son La-omʹe-don, and Laomedon's son"
369,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,Priʹam was king of Troy during the famous siege.
370,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,
371,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,The story of the founding of Troy is a very interesting one. Ilus went
372,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"forth from his father's city of Dardania, in search of adventures, as"
373,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,was the custom of young princes and heroes in those days; and he
374,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"traveled on until he arrived at the court of the king of Phrygʹi-a, a"
375,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,country lying east of Troas. Here he found the people engaged in
376,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"athletic games, at which the king gave valuable prizes for competition."
377,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"Ilus took part in a wrestling match, and he won fifty young men and"
378,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"fifty maidens,--a strange sort of prize we may well think, but not at"
379,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"all strange or unusual in ancient times, when there were many slaves"
380,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,everywhere. During his stay in Phrygia the young Dardanian prince was
381,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"hospitably entertained at the royal palace. When he was about to depart,"
382,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"the king gave him a spotted heifer, telling him to follow the animal,"
383,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,and to build a city for himself at the place where she should first lie
384,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,down to rest.
385,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,
386,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,Ilus did as he was directed. With his fifty youths and fifty maidens he
387,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"set out to follow the heifer, leaving her free to go along at her"
388,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"pleasure. She marched on for many miles, and at last lay down at the"
389,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"foot of Mount Ida on a beautiful plain watered by two rivers, and here"
390,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,Ilus encamped for the night. Before going to sleep he prayed to Jupiter
391,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,to send him a sign that that was the site meant for his city. In the
392,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,morning he found standing in front of his tent a wooden statue of the
393,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"goddess Minerva, also called Pallas. The figure was three cubits high."
394,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"In its right hand it held a spear, and in the left, a distaff and"
395,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,spindle.
396,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,
397,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"This was the Pal-laʹdi-um of Troy, which afterwards became very famous."
398,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"The Trojans believed that it had been sent down from heaven, and that"
399,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,the safety of their city depended upon its preservation. Hence it was
400,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,guarded with the greatest care in a temple specially built for the
401,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,purpose.
402,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,
403,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"Ilus, being satisfied that the statue was the sign for which he had"
404,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"prayed, immediately set about building his city, and thus Troy was"
405,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,founded. It soon became the capital of Troas and the richest and most
406,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"powerful city in that part of the world. During the reign of Laomedon,"
407,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"son of Ilus, its mighty walls were erected, which in the next reign"
408,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,withstood for ten years all the assaults of the Greeks. These walls were
409,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,the work of no human hands. They were built by the ocean god Neptune.
410,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"This god had conspired against Jupiter and attempted to dethrone him,"
411,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"and, as a punishment, his kingdom of the sea was taken away from him for"
412,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"one year, and he was ordered to spend that time in the service of the"
413,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,king of Troy.
414,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,
415,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"In building the great walls, Neptune was assisted by Apollo, who had"
416,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,also been driven from Olympus for an offense against Jupiter. Apollo had
417,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"a son named Æs-cu-laʹpi-us, who was so skilled a physician that he"
418,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"could, and did, raise people from death to life. Jupiter was very angry"
419,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,at this. He feared that men might forget him and worship Æsculapius. He
420,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,therefore hurled a thunderbolt at the great physician and killed him.
421,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"Enraged at the death of his son, Apollo threatened to destroy the"
422,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"Cyclops, the giant workmen of Vulcan, who had forged the terrible"
423,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"thunderbolt. Before he could carry out his threat, however, Jupiter"
424,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"expelled him from heaven. He remained on earth for several years, after"
425,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,which he was permitted to return to his place among the gods on the top
426,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,of Mount Olympus.

431,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,
432,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"Though Neptune was bound to serve Laomedon for one year, there was an"
433,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,agreement between them that the god should get a certain reward for
434,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,building the walls. But when the work was finished the Trojan king
435,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,refused to keep his part of the bargain. Apollo had assisted by his
436,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,powers of music. He played such tunes that he charmed even the huge
437,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"blocks of stone, so that they moved themselves into their proper places,"
438,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,after Neptune had wrenched them from the mountain sides and had hewn
439,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"them into shape. Moreover, Apollo had taken care of Laomedon's numerous"
440,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"flocks on Mount Ida. During the siege, Neptune, in a conversation with"
441,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"Apollo before the walls of Troy, spoke of their labors in the service of"
442,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,the Trojan king:
443,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,
444,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"""Hast thou forgot, how, at the monarch's prayer,"
445,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,We shared the lengthen'd labors of a year?

447,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,And yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hands:

453,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"Long before this, however, the two gods had punished Laomedon very"
454,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"severely for breaking his promise. Apollo, after being restored to"
455,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"heaven, sent a plague upon the city of Troy, and Neptune sent up from"
456,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,the sea an enormous serpent which killed many of the people.
457,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,
458,I. TROY BEFORE THE SIEGE.,"A great serpent from the deep,"

463,LEWIS MORRIS.,
464,LEWIS MORRIS.,In this terrible calamity the king asked an oracle in what way the anger
465,LEWIS MORRIS.,of the two gods might be appeased. The answer of the oracle was that a
466,LEWIS MORRIS.,Trojan maiden must each year be given to the monster to be devoured.
467,LEWIS MORRIS.,"Every year, therefore, a young girl, chosen by lot, was taken down to"
468,LEWIS MORRIS.,the seashore and chained to a rock to become the prey of the serpent.
469,LEWIS MORRIS.,"And every year the monster came and swallowed up a Trojan maiden, and"
470,LEWIS MORRIS.,"then went away and troubled the city no more until the following year,"
471,LEWIS MORRIS.,"when he returned for another victim. At last the lot fell on He-siʹo-ne,"
472,LEWIS MORRIS.,the daughter of the king. Deep was Laomedon's grief at the thought of
473,LEWIS MORRIS.,the awful fate to which his child was thus doomed.
474,LEWIS MORRIS.,
475,LEWIS MORRIS.,"But help came at an unexpected moment. While, amid the lamentations of"
476,LEWIS MORRIS.,"her family and friends, preparations were being made to chain Hesione to"
477,LEWIS MORRIS.,"the rock, the great hero, Herʹcu-les, happened to visit Troy. He was on"
478,LEWIS MORRIS.,"his way home to Greece, after performing in a distant eastern country"
479,LEWIS MORRIS.,one of those great exploits which made him famous in ancient story. The
480,LEWIS MORRIS.,"hero undertook to destroy the serpent, and thus save the princess, on"
481,LEWIS MORRIS.,condition that he should receive as a reward certain wonderful horses
482,LEWIS MORRIS.,which Laomedon just then had in his possession. These horses were given
483,LEWIS MORRIS.,"to Laomedon's grandfather, Tros, on a very interesting occasion. Tros"
484,LEWIS MORRIS.,"had a son named Ganʹy-mede, a youth of wonderful beauty, and Jupiter"
485,LEWIS MORRIS.,admired Ganymede so much that he had him carried up to heaven to be
486,LEWIS MORRIS.,cupbearer to the gods--to serve the divine nectar at the banquets on
487,LEWIS MORRIS.,Mount Olympus.
488,LEWIS MORRIS.,
489,LEWIS MORRIS.,"Godlike Ganymede, most beautiful"
490,LEWIS MORRIS.,Of men; the gods beheld and caught him up
491,LEWIS MORRIS.,"To heaven, so beautiful was he, to pour"
492,LEWIS MORRIS.,"The wine to Jove, and ever dwell with them."
493,LEWIS MORRIS.,
494,LEWIS MORRIS.,"BRYANT, _Iliad_, Book XX."
495,LEWIS MORRIS.,
496,LEWIS MORRIS.,"To compensate Tros for the loss of his son, Jupiter gave him four"
497,LEWIS MORRIS.,magnificent horses of immortal breed and marvelous fleetness. These were
498,LEWIS MORRIS.,the horses which Hercules asked as his reward for destroying the
499,LEWIS MORRIS.,"serpent. As there was no other way of saving the life of his daughter,"
500,LEWIS MORRIS.,"Laomedon consented. Hercules then went down to the seashore, bearing in"
501,LEWIS MORRIS.,"his hand the huge club which he usually carried, and wearing his"
502,LEWIS MORRIS.,lion-skin over his shoulders. This was the skin of a fierce lion he had
503,LEWIS MORRIS.,"strangled to death in a forest in Greece, and he always wore it when"
504,LEWIS MORRIS.,going to perform any of his heroic feats.
505,LEWIS MORRIS.,
506,LEWIS MORRIS.,"When Hesione had been bound to the rock, the hero stood beside her and"
507,LEWIS MORRIS.,awaited the coming of the serpent. In a short time its hideous form
508,LEWIS MORRIS.,"emerged from beneath the waves, and darting forward it was about to"
509,LEWIS MORRIS.,"seize the princess, when Hercules rushed upon it, and with mighty"
510,LEWIS MORRIS.,strokes of his club beat the monster to death. Thus was the king's
511,LEWIS MORRIS.,daughter saved and all Troy delivered from a terrible scourge. But when
512,LEWIS MORRIS.,"the hero claimed the reward that had been agreed upon, and which he had"
513,LEWIS MORRIS.,"so well earned, Laomedon again proved himself to be a man who was"
514,LEWIS MORRIS.,"neither honest nor grateful. Disregarding his promise, and forgetful,"
515,LEWIS MORRIS.,"too, of what he and his people had already suffered as a result of his"
516,LEWIS MORRIS.,"breach of faith with the two gods, he refused to give Hercules the"
517,LEWIS MORRIS.,horses.
518,LEWIS MORRIS.,
519,LEWIS MORRIS.,"The hero at once went away from Troy, but not without resolving to"
520,LEWIS MORRIS.,"return at a convenient time and punish Laomedon. This he did, not long"
521,LEWIS MORRIS.,"afterwards, when he had completed the celebrated ""twelve labors"" at"
522,LEWIS MORRIS.,"which he had been set by a Grecian king, whom Jupiter commanded him to"
523,LEWIS MORRIS.,serve for a period of years because of an offense he had committed. One
524,LEWIS MORRIS.,of these labors was the killing of the lion. Another was the destroying
525,LEWIS MORRIS.,"of the Lerʹnæ-an hydra, a frightful serpent with many heads, which for a"
526,LEWIS MORRIS.,long time had been devouring man and beast in the district of Lerʹna in
527,LEWIS MORRIS.,Greece.
528,LEWIS MORRIS.,
529,LEWIS MORRIS.,Having accomplished his twelve great labors and ended his term of
530,LEWIS MORRIS.,"service, Hercules collected an army and a fleet, and sailed to the"
531,LEWIS MORRIS.,"shores of Troas. He then marched against the city, took it by surprise,"
532,LEWIS MORRIS.,"and slew Laomedon and all his sons, with the exception of Po-darʹces,"
533,LEWIS MORRIS.,afterwards called Priam. This prince had tried to persuade his father to
534,LEWIS MORRIS.,"fulfill the engagement with Hercules, for which reason his life was"
535,LEWIS MORRIS.,"spared. He was made a slave, however, as was done in ancient times with"
536,LEWIS MORRIS.,"prisoners taken in war. But Hesione ransomed her brother, giving her"
537,LEWIS MORRIS.,gold-embroidered veil as the price of his freedom. From this time he was
538,LEWIS MORRIS.,"called Priam, a word which in the Greek language means ""purchased."""
539,LEWIS MORRIS.,Hesione also prevailed upon Hercules to restore Priam to his right as
540,LEWIS MORRIS.,"heir to his father's throne, and so he became king of Troy. Hesione"
541,LEWIS MORRIS.,"herself was carried off to Greece, where she was given in marriage to"
542,LEWIS MORRIS.,"Telʹa-mon, king of Salʹa-mis, a friend of Hercules."
543,LEWIS MORRIS.,
544,LEWIS MORRIS.,Priam reigned over his kingdom of Troas many years in peace and
545,LEWIS MORRIS.,"prosperity. His wife and queen, the virtuous Hecʹu-ba, was a daughter of"
546,LEWIS MORRIS.,"a Thracian king. They had nineteen children, many of whom became famous"
547,LEWIS MORRIS.,"during the great siege. Their eldest son, Hecʹtor, was the bravest of"
548,LEWIS MORRIS.,"the Trojan heroes. Their son Parʹis it was, as we shall see, who brought"
549,LEWIS MORRIS.,"upon his country the disastrous war. Another son, Helʹe-nus, and his"
550,LEWIS MORRIS.,"sister Cas-sanʹdra, were celebrated soothsayers."
551,LEWIS MORRIS.,
552,LEWIS MORRIS.,Cassandra was a maiden of remarkable beauty. The god Apollo loved her so
553,LEWIS MORRIS.,much that he offered to grant her any request if she would accept him as
554,LEWIS MORRIS.,her husband. Cassandra consented and asked for the power of foretelling
555,LEWIS MORRIS.,"events, but when she received it, she slighted the god and refused to"
556,LEWIS MORRIS.,"perform her promise. Apollo was enraged at her conduct, yet he could not"
557,LEWIS MORRIS.,"take back the gift he had bestowed. He decreed, however, that no one"
558,LEWIS MORRIS.,"should believe or pay any attention to her predictions, true though they"
559,LEWIS MORRIS.,should be. And so when Cassandra foretold the evils that were to come
560,LEWIS MORRIS.,"upon Troy, even her own people would not credit her words. They spoke of"
561,LEWIS MORRIS.,"her as the ""mad prophetess."""
562,LEWIS MORRIS.,
563,LEWIS MORRIS.,"Cassandra cried, and cursed the unhappy hour;"
564,LEWIS MORRIS.,"Foretold our fate; but by the god's decree,"

569,VERGIL.,The first sorrow in the lives of King Priam and his good queen came a
570,VERGIL.,"short time before the birth of Paris, when Hecuba dreamed that her next"
571,VERGIL.,child would bring ruin upon his family and native city. This caused the
572,VERGIL.,"deepest distress to Priam and Hecuba, especially when the soothsayer"
573,VERGIL.,"Æsʹa-cus declared that the dream would certainly be fulfilled. Then,"
574,VERGIL.,"though they were tender and loving parents, they made up their minds to"
575,VERGIL.,sacrifice their own feelings rather than that such a calamity should
576,VERGIL.,"befall their country. When the child was born, the king, therefore,"
577,VERGIL.,"ordered it to be given to Ar-che-laʹus, one of the shepherds of Mount"
578,VERGIL.,"Ida, with instructions to expose it in a place where it might be"
579,VERGIL.,"destroyed by wild beasts. The shepherd, though very unwilling to do so"
580,VERGIL.,"cruel a thing, was obliged to obey, but on returning to the spot a few"
581,VERGIL.,days afterwards he found the infant boy alive and unhurt. Some say that
582,VERGIL.,the child had been nursed and carefully tended by a she-bear. Archelaus
583,VERGIL.,was so touched with pity at the sight of the innocent babe smiling in

631,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,that the destruction of Troy was brought about. The strife arose on the
632,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,occasion of the marriage of Peʹleus and Theʹtis. Peleus was a king of
633,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"Thesʹsa-ly, in Greece, and one of the great heroes of those days. Thetis"
634,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"was a daughter of the sea god Neʹre-us, who had fifty daughters, all"
635,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"beautiful sea nymphs, called ""Ne-reʹi-des,"" from the name of their"
636,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"father. Their duty was to attend upon the greater sea gods, and"
637,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,especially to obey the orders of Neptune.
638,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,
639,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"Thetis was so beautiful that Jupiter himself wished to marry her, but"
640,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,the Fates told him she was destined to have a son who would be greater

642,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"should be greater than himself, gave up the idea of wedding the fair"
643,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"nymph of the sea, and consented that she should be the wife of Peleus,"
644,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"who had long loved and wooed her. But Thetis, being a goddess, was"
645,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"unwilling to marry a mortal man. However, she at last consented, and"
646,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"all the gods and goddesses, with one exception, were present at the"

662,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"a guest on so happy an occasion was not very desirable, and therefore no"

664,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,

683,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,
684,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"But soon the only competitors were Juno, Venus, and Minerva, the other"

686,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"bitter, and at last Jupiter was called upon to act as judge in the"
687,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,dispute. This delicate task the king of heaven declined to undertake. He
688,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"knew that whatever way he might decide, he would be sure to offend two"
689,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"of the three goddesses, and thereby destroy the peace of his own"
690,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"household. It was necessary, however, that an umpire should be chosen to"
691,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"put an end to the strife, and doubtless it was the decree of the Fates"
692,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,that the lot should fall on the handsome young shepherd of Mount Ida.
693,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"His wisdom and prudence were well known to the gods, and all seemed to"

697,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"apple was sent to him, to be given to that one of the three goddesses"
698,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,whom he should judge to be the most beautiful. The goddesses themselves
699,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"were directed to appear before him on Mount Ida, so that, beholding"
700,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"their charms, he might be able to give a just decision. The English"
701,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"poet, Tennyson, in his poem ""Œnone,"" gives a fine description of the"
702,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"three contending deities standing in the presence of the Trojan prince,"
703,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"each in her turn trying, by promise of great reward, to persuade him to"
704,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"declare in her favor. Juno spoke first, and she offered to bestow kingly"

715,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,
716,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"Then Venus approached the young prince, who all the while held the"

739,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"for it may be supposed that Venus, being the goddess of beauty, was"
740,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,really the most beautiful of the three. But the story does not give us a
741,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"very high idea of the character of Paris, who now no longer took"
742,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,pleasure in the company of Œnone. All his thoughts and affections were
743,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"turned away from her by the promise of Venus. He had grown weary, too,"
744,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,of his simple and innocent life among his flocks and herds on the
745,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,mountain. He therefore wished much for some adventure that would take
746,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,him away from scenes which had become distasteful to him.

752,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"The opportunity soon came. A member of King Priam's family having died,"
753,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,it was announced that the funeral would be celebrated by athletic
754,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"games, as was the custom in ancient times. Paris resolved to go down to"
755,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,the city and take part in these games. Prizes were to be offered for
756,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"competition, and one of the prizes was to be the finest bull that could"
757,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,be picked from the herds on Mount Ida. Now it happened that the bull
758,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"selected belonged to Paris himself, but it could not be taken without"
759,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"his consent. He was willing, however, to give it for the games on"
760,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,condition that he should be permitted to enter the list of competitors.
761,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,
762,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"The condition was agreed to, and so the shepherd prince parted from"
763,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"Œnone and went to the funeral games at Troy. He intended, perhaps, to"
764,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"return sometime, but it was many years before he saw the fair nymph of"
765,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"Mount Ida again,--not until he was about to die of a wound received from"
766,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"one of the Greeks in the Trojan War. Œnone knew what was to happen, for"
767,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"Apollo had conferred upon her the gift of prophecy, and she warned Paris"
768,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,that if he should go away from her he would bring ruin on himself and
769,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"his country, telling him also that he would seek for her help when it"
770,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"would be too late to save him. These predictions, as we shall see, were"
771,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,fulfilled. Œnone's grief and despair in her loneliness after the
772,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,departure of Paris are touchingly described in Tennyson's poem:
773,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,
774,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"""O happy Heaven, how canst thou see my face?"
775,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"O happy earth, how canst thou bear my weight?"

777,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"There are enough unhappy on this earth,"
778,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"Pass by the happy souls, that love to live:"
779,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"I pray thee, pass before my light of life,"

781,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"Thou weighest heavy on the heart within,"
782,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"Weigh heavy on my eyelids: let me die."""
783,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,
784,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,At the athletic games in Troy everybody admired the noble appearance of
785,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"Paris, but nobody knew who he was. In the competitions he won all the"
786,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"first prizes, for Venus had given him godlike strength and swiftness. He"
787,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"defeated even Hector, who was the greatest athlete of Troy. Hector,"
788,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,angry at finding himself and all the highborn young men of the city
789,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"beaten by an unknown stranger, resolved to put him to death, and Paris"
790,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"would probably have been killed, had he not fled for safety into the"
791,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"temple of Jupiter. Cassandra, who happened to be in the temple at the"
792,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"time, noticed Paris closely, and observing that he bore a strong"
793,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"resemblance to her brothers, she asked him about his birth and age. From"
794,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"his answers she was satisfied that he was her brother, and she at once"
795,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,introduced him to the king. Further inquiries were then made. The old
796,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"shepherd, Archelaus, to whom Paris had been delivered in his infancy to"
797,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"be exposed on Mount Ida, was still living, and he came and told his"
798,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,story. Then King Priam and Queen Hecuba joyfully embraced and welcomed
799,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"their son, never thinking of the terrible dream or of the prophecy of"
800,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"Æsacus. Hector, no longer angry or jealous, was glad to see his brother,"
801,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,and proud of his victories in the games. Everybody rejoiced except
802,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"Cassandra. She knew the evil which was to come to Troy through Paris,"
803,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"but nobody would give credit to what the ""mad prophetess"" said."
804,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,
805,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,Thus restored to his high position as a prince of the royal house of
806,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"Troy, Paris now resided in his father's palace, apparently contented and"
807,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"happy. But the promise made to him on Mount Ida, which he carefully"
808,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"concealed from his family, was always in his mind. His thoughts were"
809,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"ever turned toward Greece, where dwelt the fairest woman of those times."
810,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"This was Helen, wife of Men-e-laʹus, king of Sparʹta, celebrated"
811,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,throughout the ancient world for her matchless beauty. Paris had been

813,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,be no other than the far-famed Helen. To Greece therefore he resolved to
814,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"go, as soon as there should be an excuse for undertaking what was then a"
815,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"long and dangerous voyage of many weeks, though in our day it is no more"
816,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,than a few hours' sail.
817,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,
818,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,The occasion was found when King Priam resolved to send ambassadors to
819,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"the island of Salamis to demand the restoration of his sister Hesione,"
820,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"whom Hercules had carried off many years before. Her husband, Telamon,"
821,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"was now dead, but his son Aʹjax still held her as a prisoner at his"
822,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"court. Priam had never forgotten his sister's love for himself, for she"
823,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"it was, as will be remembered, who redeemed him from slavery and placed"
824,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,him on his father's throne. He now determined that she should be brought
825,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"back to her native country, and Paris earnestly begged permission to"
826,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,take charge of the expedition which was to be sent to Salamis for that
827,II. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.,"purpose. Priam consented, and a fleet worthy to convey the son of the"

918,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,without offending all the rest. He therefore resolved to adopt the

934,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"the difficulty about Helen, if Tyndarus would give him Penelope to be"

936,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"choose for herself which of the princes she would have for her husband,"
937,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"but that before she did so, all the suitors should pledge themselves by"

981,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"of Helen and the treasures which Paris had carried off. Diʹo-mede, king"

986,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,When the Greek ambassadors arrived in the Trojan capital they were

1004,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,
1005,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"But the eloquence of Ulysses was of no avail. King Priam, blinded by his"
1006,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"love for his son, saw not the threatened danger, and he refused the"
1007,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,demand of the ambassadors. Menelaus was not even permitted to see his
1008,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"wife. Ulysses and his companions then returned to Greece, and at once"
1009,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,preparations for war with Troy were commenced.
1010,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,
1011,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,These preparations occupied a very long time. Ten years were spent in
1012,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"getting together the vast force, which in more than a thousand ships was"
1013,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"carried across the Ægean Sea to the Trojan shores, from the port of"
1014,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,Auʹlis on the east coast-of Greece. Some of the Hel-lenʹic (Greek)
1015,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"princes were very unwilling to join the expedition, as they knew that"
1016,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"the struggle would be a tedious and perilous one. Even Ulysses, who, as"
1017,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"we have seen, had first proposed the suitors' oath at Sparta, was at the"
1018,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"last moment unwilling to go. He had now become king of Ithaca, his"
1019,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"father, La-erʹtes, having retired from the cares of government, and he"
1020,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"would gladly have remained in his happy island home with his young wife,"
1021,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"Penelope, and his infant son, Te-lemʹa-chus, both of whom he tenderly"
1022,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,loved.
1023,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,
1024,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,But the man of many arts could not be spared from the Trojan War. He
1025,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"paid no heed, however, to the messages sent to him asking him to join"
1026,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"the army at Aulis. Agamemnon resolved, therefore, to go himself to"
1027,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,Ithaca to persuade Ulysses to take part in the expedition. He was
1028,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"accompanied by his brother Menelaus, and by a chief named Pal-a-meʹdes,"
1029,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,a very wise and learned man as well as a brave warrior. As soon as
1030,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"Ulysses heard of their arrival in Ithaca, he pretended to be insane, and"
1031,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,he tried by a very amusing stratagem to make them believe that he was
1032,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"really mad. Dressing himself in his best clothes, and going down to the"
1033,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"seashore, he began to plow the beach with a horse and an _ox_ yoked"
1034,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"together, and to scatter salt upon the sand instead of seed."

1040,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"Palamedes, however, was more than a match in artifice for the Ithacan"
1041,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"king. Taking Telemachus from the arms of his nurse, he placed the"
1042,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,infant on the sand in front of the plowing team. Ulysses quickly turned
1043,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"the animals aside to avoid injuring his child, thus proving that he was"
1044,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,not mad but in full possession of his senses. The king of Ithaca was
1045,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,therefore obliged to join the expedition to Troy. With twelve ships well
1046,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"manned he sailed from his rugged island, which he did not again see for"
1047,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"twenty years. Ten years he spent at the siege, and ten on his homeward"
1048,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"voyage, during which he met with the wonderful adventures that Homer"
1049,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,describes in the Odyssey.
1050,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,
1051,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,Ulysses had his revenge upon Palamedes in a manner very unworthy of a
1052,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"brave man. In the camp before Troy, during the siege, he bribed one of"
1053,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,the servants of Palamedes to conceal a sum of money in his master's
1054,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"tent. He then forged a letter, which he read before a council of the"
1055,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"Greek generals, saying that Palamedes had taken it from a Trojan"
1056,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"prisoner. This letter was written as if by King Priam to Palamedes,"
1057,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,thanking him for the information he had given regarding the plans of the
1058,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"Greeks, and mentioning money as having been sent him in reward for his"
1059,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,services. The Greek generals at once ordered a search to be made in the
1060,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"tent of Palamedes, and the money being found where it had been hidden by"
1061,III. THE LEAGUE AGAINST TROY.,"direction of Ulysses, the unfortunate Palamedes was immediately put to"

1073,VERGIL.,
1074,VERGIL.,There was another of the Greek princes whose help in the Trojan War was
1075,VERGIL.,obtained only by an ingenious trick. This was the famous A-chilʹles. He
1076,VERGIL.,"was the son of Peleus and Thetis, at whose marriage feast Eris threw the"
1077,VERGIL.,apple of discord on the table. The prophecy that Thetis would have a son
1078,VERGIL.,"greater than his father was fulfilled in Achilles, the bravest of the"
1079,VERGIL.,"Greeks at the Trojan War, and the principal hero of Homer's Iliad."
1080,VERGIL.,
1081,VERGIL.,Thetis educated her son with great care. She had him instructed in all
1082,VERGIL.,the accomplishments fitting for princes of those times. When he was an
1083,VERGIL.,"infant she dipped him in the river Styx, which, it was believed, made it"
1084,VERGIL.,impossible for any weapon wielded by mortal hands to wound him. But the
1085,VERGIL.,water did not touch the child's heel by which his mother held him when
1086,VERGIL.,"she plunged him in the river, and it was in this part that he received"
1087,VERGIL.,the wound of which he died.
1088,VERGIL.,
1089,VERGIL.,"Notwithstanding his being dipped in the Styx, Thetis was afraid to let"
1090,VERGIL.,"Achilles go to the Trojan War, for Jupiter had told her that he would be"
1091,VERGIL.,"killed if he took part in it. For this reason, as soon as she heard that"
1092,VERGIL.,"the Grecian princes were gathering their forces, she secretly sent the"
1093,VERGIL.,"youth to the court of Lyc-o-meʹdes, king of the island of Scyʹros. Here"
1094,VERGIL.,"Achilles, dressed like a young girl, resided as a companion of the"
1095,VERGIL.,"king's daughters. But Calʹchas, the soothsayer of the Grecian army, told"
1096,VERGIL.,the chiefs that without the help of Achilles Troy could not be taken.
1097,VERGIL.,
1098,VERGIL.,"Calchas the wise, the Grecian priest and guide,"

1106,VERGIL.,them. In this difficulty the wily king of Ithaca did good service. After
1107,VERGIL.,much inquiry he discovered that Achilles was at Scyros with the king's
1108,VERGIL.,"daughters. He soon made his way to the island, but here there was a new"
1109,VERGIL.,"difficulty. He had never seen the young prince, and how was he to know"
1110,VERGIL.,him? But he devised a scheme which proved entirely successful. Equipping
1111,VERGIL.,"himself as a peddler, he went to the royal palace, exhibiting jewelry"
1112,VERGIL.,and other fancy articles to attract the attention of the ladies of the
1113,VERGIL.,family. He also had some beautiful weapons of war among his wares.

1122,VERGIL.,"young prince of whom he was in search, the pretended peddler announced"

1269,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"Teu-thra'ni-a, a district in the kingdom of Mys'i-a, lying southeast of"

1271,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"Tel'e-phus, the king of that country, who came down upon them with a"
1272,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"strong force, and drove them back to their ships after a battle in which"
1273,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,many of them were killed. They would probably have fared much worse had
1274,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"it not been for the friendly aid of Bacʹchus, the god of wine. While"
1275,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,Telephus was fighting at the head of his men he tripped and fell over a
1276,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"vine, which the god had caused to spring up suddenly from the earth at"
1277,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,his feet. As he lay flat on the ground Achilles rushed forward and
1278,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,severely wounded him with a thrust of his spear.
1279,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,
1280,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"The Greeks, however, were obliged to take to the sea, and soon afterward"
1281,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"a great storm arose, which destroyed many of their vessels. Owing to"
1282,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"this misfortune they had to return to Aulis, where they set about"
1283,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,repairing their damaged ships and getting ready to start again. While
1284,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"the Greeks were thus engaged, they were surprised by the appearance of"
1285,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"King Telephus, who came to their camp to beg Achilles to cure his wound,"
1286,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,an oracle he had consulted having told him that he could be cured only
1287,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,by the person who had wounded him.
1288,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,
1289,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"Achilles was at first unwilling to comply with the request of Telephus,"
1290,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,but Ulysses advised him to do so. Telephus was one of the sons of
1291,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"Hercules, and it had been decreed that without the help of a son of that"
1292,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"hero Troy could not be taken. Moreover, he was a son-in-law of Priam,"
1293,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,and his country lay close to where the war was to be carried on. For
1294,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"these reasons Ulysses wished to make him friendly to the Greeks, and so"
1295,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,he persuaded Achilles to cure the Teuthranian king. Achilles did this by
1296,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,dropping into the wound portions of the rust from the point of his
1297,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,spear. Telephus was so grateful that he joined the expedition against
1298,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"Troy, and undertook to pilot the Grecian fleet to the Trojan coast."
1299,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,
1300,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,But another difficulty now stood in the way of the Greeks. Their fleet
1301,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"was once more ready for departure, but the winds were unfavorable. In"
1302,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,ancient times they could not make a sea voyage when the winds were
1303,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,"against them. Their ships were very small, and were moved only by oars"
1304,IV. BEGINNING OF THE WAR.,and sails. Homer gives us a good idea of the ancient system of

1569,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1570,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1571,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,For over nine years the siege was carried on without one side or the
1572,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,other gaining any important victory. The Trojans were protected by their
1573,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"walls, which the Greeks were unable to break down, for the ancients had"
1574,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,no such powerful engines of war as those used in armies of the present
1575,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,day. The strongest buildings may now be easily destroyed by cannon; but
1576,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,in those days they had no cannon or gunpowder or dynamite. Success in
1577,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,war in ancient times depended almost entirely on the bravery of the
1578,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"soldiers or on strategy and artifice, in which, as we shall see, the"
1579,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,king of Ithaca was much skilled.
1580,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1581,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"The Greek and Trojan warriors fought with swords, axes, bows and arrows,"
1582,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"and javelins, or long spears tipped with sharp iron points. Sometimes"
1583,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,they used huge stones which the heroes hurled at the foe with the full
1584,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,strength of their powerful arms. They had shields of circular or oval
1585,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"shape, which they wore on the arm to ward off blows, and which could be"
1586,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,moved at pleasure so as to cover almost any part of the body. Their
1587,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"chests were protected by corselets or breastplates made of metal, and"
1588,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"metal greaves, or boots, incased their legs from the knees to the feet."
1589,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"On their heads they wore helmets, usually of brass."
1590,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1591,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"The chiefs fought in chariots, from which they darted their spears at"
1592,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,the enemy with such force and so true an aim as to wound or kill at a
1593,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"considerable distance. The chariots were two-wheeled, open at the back,"
1594,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"and often drawn by three horses. They usually carried two warriors, both"
1595,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"standing, and the charioteer, or driver, was generally the companion or"
1596,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"friend, and not the servant, of the fighters who stood behind him."
1597,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,Sometimes the warriors came down from their chariots and fought hand to
1598,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,hand at close quarters with the enemy. The common soldiers always fought
1599,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,on foot. There were no horse soldiers.
1600,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1601,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,But in the Trojan War success or defeat did not always depend on the
1602,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,bravery of the soldiers or on the skill or strategy of the generals.
1603,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,Very much depended on the gods. We have seen how those divine beings had
1604,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,to do with the events that led to the war. We shall also see them taking
1605,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"part in the battles, sometimes giving victory to one side and sometimes"
1606,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,to the other. The Trojan War was in fact as much a war of the gods as of
1607,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"men, and in Homer's story we find Jupiter and Juno and Apollo and"
1608,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,Neptune and Venus and Minerva mentioned almost as frequently as the
1609,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,Greek and Trojan heroes. In the beginning of the Iliad we find Apollo
1610,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,sending a plague among the Greeks because of an insult offered to his
1611,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"priest, Chryʹses; for the daughter of Chryses, a beautiful maiden named"
1612,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"Chry-seʹis, was carried off by Achilles after the taking of Theʹbe, a"
1613,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,town of Mysia.
1614,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1615,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,During the long siege the Grecian chiefs extended the war into the
1616,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,surrounding districts. While part of their forces was left at the camp
1617,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"to protect the ships and keep the Trojans cooped up within their walls,"
1618,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"expeditions were sent out against many of the towns of Troas, or of the"
1619,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,neighboring countries which were allies and supporters of Troy. When the
1620,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,Greeks captured a town they carried off not only the provisions and
1621,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"riches it contained, but also many of its inhabitants, whom they sold as"
1622,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"slaves, according to the custom of the time, or kept as slaves in their"
1623,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"own service. In one of these expeditions Priam's youngest son,"
1624,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"Troʹi-lus, the hero of Shakespeare's play of ""Troilus and Cresʹsi-da,"""
1625,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,was slain by Achilles.
1626,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1627,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"It was in the tenth year of the war that Thebe was taken, and the maiden"
1628,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,Chryseis was captured. About the same time the town of Lyr-nesʹsus was
1629,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"seized by an expedition, also led by Achilles, and among the prisoners"
1630,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,was a beautiful woman named Bri-seʹis. In the division of the spoils
1631,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"among the chiefs, Chryseis fell to the share of Agamemnon, and the"
1632,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"maiden Briseis was given to Achilles, who took her to his tent with the"
1633,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,intention of making her his wife. But the priest Chryses was deeply
1634,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"grieved at the taking away of his daughter, and he came to the Grecian"
1635,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,camp to beg the chiefs to restore her to him. In his hand he bore a
1636,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"golden scepter bound with fillets, or green branches, the emblems of his"
1637,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"priestly office, and he also carried with him valuable gifts for King"
1638,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,Agamemnon. Being admitted to the presence of the warrior chiefs
1639,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"assembled in council, he begged them to release his child."
1640,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1641,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"He sued to all, but chief implored for grace"
1642,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"The brother-kings, of Atreus' royal race."
1643,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"""Ye kings and warriors! may your vows be crown'd,"
1644,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,And Troy's proud walls lie level with the ground.
1645,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,May Jove restore you when your toils are o'er
1646,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,Safe to the pleasures of your native shore.
1647,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"But, oh! relieve a wretched parent's pain,"

1687,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"throughout the camp, the archer god darted his terrible arrows among the"
1688,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"Greeks, smiting them down in great numbers."
1689,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1690,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"He came as comes the night,"
1691,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"And, seated from the ships aloof, sent forth"
1692,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,An arrow; terrible was heard the clang
1693,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,Of that resplendent bow. At first he smote
1694,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"The mules and the swift dogs, and then on man"
1695,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,He turned the deadly arrow. All around
1696,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,Glared evermore the frequent funeral piles.

1700,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"For nine days the arrows of death were sent upon the Greek army, and the"

1702,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,custom in those times to burn the bodies of the dead. On the tenth day
1703,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,of the plague Achilles called a council of the chiefs to consider how
1704,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"the anger of the god might be appeased, and he spoke before them,"
1705,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,saying:
1706,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1707,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"""Let us consult some prophet or priest who will tell us why Phœbus"
1708,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"Apollo is so much enraged with us, and whether he may, when we shall"

1710,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"is destroying our people."""
1711,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1712,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"Then Calchas, the soothsayer, arose and said:"
1713,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1714,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"""O Achilles, I can tell why the god is wroth against us, and willing I"
1715,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"am to tell it, but perhaps I may irritate the king who rules over all"
1716,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"the Argives, and in his anger he may do evil to me. Promise me,"
1717,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"therefore, your protection, and I will declare why this plague has come"
1718,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"upon the Greeks."""
1719,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1720,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"""Fear nothing, O Calchas,"" answered Achilles. ""While I am alive not one"
1721,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"of all the Greeks, not even Agamemnon himself, shall harm you."""
1722,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1723,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"""Fear nothing, but speak boldly out whate'er"
1724,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"Thou knowest, and declare the will of heaven."

1733,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"Thus encouraged, Calchas announced to the chiefs that Apollo was angry"
1734,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,because his priest had been dishonored and insulted by Agamemnon. This
1735,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"was why the people were perishing, and the wrath of the god could be"
1736,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"appeased only by restoring Chryseis to her father, and sending a hundred"
1737,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,victims to be offered in sacrifice to the god. Upon hearing these words
1738,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,Agamemnon was filled with anger against Calchas.
1739,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1740,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"""Prophet of evil,"" he exclaimed, ""never have you spoken anything good"
1741,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"for me. And now you say I must give up the maiden. I shall do so, since"

1746,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,To this Achilles answered that there was no prize just then that

1754,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"shall be content, but if not, I will seize yours or that of Ajax or"
1755,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"Ulysses. This matter, however, we will attend to afterwards. For the"

1758,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1759,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"At this Achilles was very angry, and he said:"

1764,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,It is to get satisfaction for your brother we have come here in our

1767,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"little treasure to share."""
1768,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1769,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"Greatly enraged at this speech, Agamemnon replied in wrathful words: ""Go"

1772,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1773,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"""Thus, in turn,"

1784,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"Furious at this threat, Achilles put his hand to his sword with the"
1785,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"intention of slaying Agamemnon, and he had half drawn the weapon from"
1786,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"its scabbard, but just at that moment the goddess Minerva stood behind"
1787,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,him and caught him by his yellow hair. She had been sent down from
1788,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"heaven by Juno to pacify the hero, for Juno and Minerva were friendly to"
1789,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"the Greeks. Ever since the judgment on Mount Ida they hated Paris, and"

1799,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1800,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,But Minerva spoke soothing words to the hero:

1889,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,an account of the disasters which happened to the Greeks through the
1890,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"anger of Achilles. The poem, indeed, relates the events of only"
1891,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"fifty-eight days, but they were events of the highest interest and they"
1892,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,were very numerous. It is remarked by Pope that the subject of the Iliad
1893,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,is the shortest and most single ever chosen by any poet. Yet Homer has
1894,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"supplied a vaster variety of incidents, a greater number of councils,"

1915,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,"as god of music and the fine arts, was their leader. They held their"

1919,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,
1920,V. THE WRATH OF ACHILLES.,The epic poets usually began their poems by invoking the aid of the

2149,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,as sent to him in his dream. All agreed that the divine will should be
2150,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,"obeyed, but Agamemnon, like a prudent general, thought it would be well,"
2151,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,"before going to battle, to find out whether the troops, after their"
2152,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,"toils of nine years, were still willing to support him in carrying on"
2153,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,the war. With this object he resolved to try the plan of pretending to
2154,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,them that he had made up his mind to stop the siege and return at once
2155,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,to Greece. But he directed the chiefs to advise their followers not to
2156,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,"consent to the proposal, and to encourage them to make one more fight"
2157,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,for the honor of their country. Then the heralds summoned the whole army
2158,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,"to assemble, and the vast host gathered together on the plain before the"
2159,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,"camp, to listen to the words of their commander. Homer's description of"
2160,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,the muster of the forces on this occasion is very beautiful:
2161,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,
2162,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,"The sceptred rulers lead; the following host,"
2163,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,"Pour'd forth by thousands, darkens all the coast."

2168,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,"Dusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,"
2169,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,And o'er the vale descends the living cloud.
2170,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,"So, from the tents and ships, a lengthen'd train"
2171,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,"Spreads all the beach, and wide o'ershades the plain:"
2172,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,Along the region runs a deafening sound;

2179,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,leaning on his scepter. He told them he now believed that Troy could not
2180,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,"be taken, and that Jupiter, who before promised victory to the Greeks,"
2181,VI. THE DREAM OF AGAMEMNON.,now commanded them to return to Argos.

5208,VERGIL.,"Myrmidons. The brave Memnon was slain, and Aurora bore away his body"
5209,VERGIL.,that funeral rites might be performed.
5210,VERGIL.,
5211,VERGIL.,But the time was now at hand when the great warrior who so far had
5212,VERGIL.,conquered in every fight was to meet his own doom. We have seen that
5213,VERGIL.,"Hector, as he lay dying in front of the Scæan Gate, warned Achilles"
5214,VERGIL.,that he himself should fall by the hand of Paris. This prophecy was
5215,VERGIL.,fulfilled.
5216,VERGIL.,
5217,VERGIL.,By the death of Memnon the Trojans were much discouraged. Their powerful
5218,VERGIL.,"allies had been defeated, and they were no longer able to hold the field"
5219,VERGIL.,against the enemy. Soon after the death of Memnon there was a great
5220,VERGIL.,"battle, in which the Greeks, headed by Achilles, drove them back to the"
5221,VERGIL.,"city walls. Through the Scæan Gate, which lay open, the Trojans rushed"
5222,VERGIL.,"in terror and confusion, the Greeks pressing on close behind. Achilles"
5223,VERGIL.,"reached the gate, and was about to enter, when Paris aimed at him with"
5224,VERGIL.,"an arrow. Guided by Apollo, the weapon struck the hero in the heel, the"
5225,VERGIL.,only part in which he could be fatally wounded.
5226,VERGIL.,
5227,VERGIL.,"The warrior fell to the ground, whereupon the Trojan prince hastened up"
5228,VERGIL.,and slew him with his sword. A terrific struggle took place over the
5229,VERGIL.,"body of the dead chief, but by mighty efforts Ajax Telamon and Ulysses"
5230,VERGIL.,"succeeded in gaining possession of it, and carrying it to the Grecian"
5231,VERGIL.,camp. Deep was the grief of the Greeks at the death of their great
5232,VERGIL.,champion. Magnificent funeral rites and games were celebrated in his
5233,VERGIL.,"honor, his goddess mother, Thetis, presiding over the ceremonies. After"
5234,VERGIL.,"the body had been burned in the customary manner, the bones were placed"
5235,VERGIL.,"in a vase of gold, made by Vulcan, and a vast mound was raised on the"
5236,VERGIL.,shore as a monument to the hero.
5237,VERGIL.,
5238,VERGIL.,The sacred army of the warlike Greeks
5239,VERGIL.,Built up a tomb magnificently vast
5240,VERGIL.,"Upon a cape of the broad Hellespont,"
5241,VERGIL.,"There to be seen, far off upon the deep,"
5242,VERGIL.,"By those who now are born, or shall be born"
5243,VERGIL.,In future years.
5244,VERGIL.,
5245,VERGIL.,"BRYANT, _Odyssey_, Book XXIV."
5246,VERGIL.,
5247,VERGIL.,The armor of Achilles was offered as a reward for the warrior who had
5248,VERGIL.,"fought most bravely in rescuing the body, and who had done most harm to"
5249,VERGIL.,the Trojans. To decide the question which of the Greek chiefs deserved
5250,VERGIL.,"this honor, it was resolved to take the votes of the Trojan prisoners"
5251,VERGIL.,"then in the Greek camp, who had witnessed the struggle at the Scæan"
5252,VERGIL.,"Gate. The majority of votes were in favor of Ulysses, and to him,"
5253,VERGIL.,"therefore, the splendid shield and corselet and helmet and greaves, made"
5254,VERGIL.,"by Vulcan for the son of Thetis, were given. Ajax was so disappointed"
5255,VERGIL.,and grieved at not having obtained the coveted prize that he became
5256,VERGIL.,"insane, and in his frenzy he slew himself with his own sword."
5257,VERGIL.,
5258,VERGIL.,"The Greeks had now lost their two most powerful warriors, and they began"
5259,VERGIL.,"to think that it was impossible for them to take Troy by force, and"
5260,VERGIL.,that they must try other methods. So the wise Ulysses then set his
5261,VERGIL.,brain to work to devise some stratagem by which the city might be taken.
5262,VERGIL.,"The first thing he did was to capture the Trojan prince and soothsayer,"
5263,VERGIL.,"Helenus, who had gone out from the city to offer sacrifices in the"
5264,VERGIL.,"temple of Apollo on Mount Ida. Calchas, the Greek soothsayer, had said"
5265,VERGIL.,that Helenus was the only mortal who knew by what means Troy could be
5266,VERGIL.,"conquered, and so Ulysses made him prisoner and threatened him with"
5267,VERGIL.,death if he did not tell.
5268,VERGIL.,
5269,VERGIL.,Then Helenus told the Ithacan chief that before Troy could be taken
5270,VERGIL.,"three things must be done. First, he said, the Greeks must get the"
5271,VERGIL.,"arrows of Hercules; next, they must carry away the sacred Palladium, for"
5272,VERGIL.,"as long as it remained within the walls the city was safe; and, lastly,"
5273,VERGIL.,they must have the help of the son of Achilles.
5274,VERGIL.,
5275,VERGIL.,"Now the arrows of Hercules could be obtained only from Phil-oc-teʹtes, a"
5276,VERGIL.,Greek chief who received them from Hercules himself. These arrows had
5277,VERGIL.,"been dipped in the blood of the hydra, a monster Hercules had slain."
5278,VERGIL.,"This made them poisonous, so that wounds inflicted by them were fatal."
5279,VERGIL.,Philoctetes was with his countrymen at Aulis when they set sail for
5280,VERGIL.,"Troy, but he was bitten on the foot by a serpent, and the smell of the"
5281,VERGIL.,"injured part being so offensive that his comrades could not endure it,"
5282,VERGIL.,"he had been left behind, on the advice of Ulysses."
5283,VERGIL.,
5284,VERGIL.,"Far in an island, suffering grievous pangs,--"
5285,VERGIL.,The hallowed isle of Lemnos. There the Greeks
5286,VERGIL.,"Left him, in torture from a venomed wound"
5287,VERGIL.,Made by a serpent's fangs. He lay and pined.
5288,VERGIL.,
5289,VERGIL.,"BRYANT, _Iliad_, Book II."
5290,VERGIL.,
5291,VERGIL.,"Ulysses now resolved to get Philoctetes to come to Troy, if he were"
5292,VERGIL.,"still alive, and so, taking Diomede with him, he set out for Lemnos."
5293,VERGIL.,They found him at the cave where they had left him ten years before. The
5294,VERGIL.,"wound was not yet healed, and he had suffered much, having had no means"
5295,VERGIL.,of existence except game which he had to procure himself.
5296,VERGIL.,
5297,VERGIL.,"Exposed to the inclement skies,"
5298,VERGIL.,Deserted and forlorn he lies;
5299,VERGIL.,"No friend or fellow-mourner there,"
5300,VERGIL.,To soothe his sorrows and divide his care.
5301,VERGIL.,
5302,VERGIL.,SOPHOCLES (Francklin's tr.)
5303,VERGIL.,
5304,VERGIL.,"Still enraged at their former ill-treatment of him, Philoctetes at first"
5305,VERGIL.,refused the request of the two chiefs. Their mission would have failed
5306,VERGIL.,had not Hercules appeared to him in a dream and advised him to go to
5307,VERGIL.,"Troy, telling him that his wound would be healed by the famous Machaon."
5308,VERGIL.,He then gladly went with Ulysses and Diomede. On his arrival at the
5309,VERGIL.,Grecian camp the great physician cured him by casting him into a deep
5310,VERGIL.,sleep and cutting away the diseased flesh from the injured foot. He
5311,VERGIL.,"awoke in perfect health and strength, and at once joined his countrymen"
5312,VERGIL.,"in the war, resolved to make good use of his fatal arrows."
5313,VERGIL.,
5314,VERGIL.,"An opportunity soon offered, for the Trojans now began again to venture"
5315,VERGIL.,"out in the open plain, thinking that the Greeks were not so dangerous"
5316,VERGIL.,since the terrible Achilles was no longer at their head. Their new
5317,VERGIL.,"general in chief was Paris, and Philoctetes, happening to encounter him"
5318,VERGIL.,"in battle, aimed at him with one of his poisoned arrows and pierced him"
5319,VERGIL.,"through the shoulder. Paris was immediately carried back to the city,"
5320,VERGIL.,"suffering intense pain, for the poison quickly began to take effect."
5321,VERGIL.,"Then at last the thoughts of Paris turned to the fair Œnone, whom,"
5322,VERGIL.,"twenty years before, he had left in sorrow and loneliness on Mount Ida."
5323,VERGIL.,"He remembered her words, that he would one day have recourse to her for"
5324,VERGIL.,"help. Hoping, therefore, that she might take pity on him, and perhaps"
5325,VERGIL.,"cure him of his wound, for she had been instructed in medicine by"
5326,VERGIL.,"Apollo, he ordered his attendants to carry him to where she still dwelt"
5327,VERGIL.,on the slopes of Ida. Œnone had not forgotten his cruel desertion of
5328,VERGIL.,"her, and so she refused to use her skill in his behalf. But when she"
5329,VERGIL.,"heard that he was dead, she came down to Troy, and in her grief threw"
5330,VERGIL.,"herself on his funeral pyre, and perished by his side."
5331,VERGIL.,
5332,VERGIL.,"She rose, and slowly down,"
5333,VERGIL.,"By the long torrent's ever-deepen'd roar,"
5334,VERGIL.,"Paced, following, as in trance, the silent cry."
5335,VERGIL.,.    .    .    .    .    .    .
5336,VERGIL.,Then moving quickly forward till the heat
5337,VERGIL.,"Smote on her brow, she lifted up a voice"
5338,VERGIL.,"Of shrill command, ""Who burns upon the pyre?"""
5339,VERGIL.,"Whereon their oldest and their boldest said,"
5340,VERGIL.,"""He whom thou wouldst not heal!"" and all at once"
5341,VERGIL.,The morning light of happy marriage broke
5342,VERGIL.,"Thro' all the clouded years of widowhood,"
5343,VERGIL.,"And muffling up her comely head, and crying"
5344,VERGIL.,"""Husband!"" she leapt upon the funeral pile,"
5345,VERGIL.,And mixt herself with him and past in fire.

5347,VERGIL.,"TENNYSON, _Death of Œnone_."
5348,VERGIL.,
5349,VERGIL.,"Meanwhile the Ithacan king, not forgetting the other conditions"
5350,VERGIL.,"mentioned by Helenus, set sail for the island of Scyros, where the son"
5351,VERGIL.,"of Achilles resided. His name was Pyrʹrhus, or Ne-op-tolʹ-mus, and, as"
5352,VERGIL.,"he was a brave youth, he rejoiced at having an opportunity of fighting"
5353,VERGIL.,"the Trojans, by whom his father had been killed. Ulysses gave him his"
5354,VERGIL.,"father's armor, and by many heroic deeds in the war he proved that he"
5355,VERGIL.,was worthy to wear it.
5356,VERGIL.,
5357,VERGIL.,"The Palladium was now to be carried off from Troy, and this was a task"
5358,VERGIL.,by no means easy to perform. But the man of many arts succeeded in
5359,VERGIL.,"accomplishing it. Putting on the garments of a beggar, and scourging his"
5360,VERGIL.,"body so as to leave marks, he went to the Scæan Gate, and entreated the"
5361,VERGIL.,"guards to admit him. He told them that he was a Greek slave, and that he"
5362,VERGIL.,wished to escape from his master who had cruelly ill-used him. The
5363,VERGIL.,"guards, believing his story, permitted him to enter the city."
5364,VERGIL.,
5365,VERGIL.,"""He had given himself"
5366,VERGIL.,"Unseemly stripes, and o'er his shoulders flung"
5367,VERGIL.,"Vile garments like a slave's, and entered thus"
5368,VERGIL.,"The enemy's town, and walked its spacious streets."
5369,VERGIL.,Another man he seemed in that disguise.--
5370,VERGIL.,"A beggar, though when at the Achaian fleet"
5371,VERGIL.,So different was the semblance that he wore.
5372,VERGIL.,"He entered Ilium thus transformed, and none"
5373,VERGIL.,"Knew who it was that passed."""

5375,VERGIL.,"BRYANT, _Odyssey_, Book IV."
5376,VERGIL.,
5377,VERGIL.,"But Helen, happening to pass by at a place near the king's palace, where"
5378,VERGIL.,"the pretended beggar sat down to rest, immediately recognized him. He"
5379,VERGIL.,"made a sign to her to keep silent, thinking that Paris being now dead,"
5380,VERGIL.,"Helen perhaps was friendly to the Greeks, and wished them to take Troy,"
5381,VERGIL.,"so that she might return to her own country. In this Ulysses was right,"
5382,VERGIL.,"as very soon appeared, and as Helen declared years afterwards, when"
5383,VERGIL.,"telling to his own son, Telemachus, the story of the Ithacan king's"
5384,VERGIL.,adventure within the walls of Troy.
5385,VERGIL.,
5386,VERGIL.,"""For I already longed"

5390,VERGIL.,
5391,VERGIL.,"BRYANT, _Odyssey_, Book IV."
5392,VERGIL.,
5393,VERGIL.,"Helen passed on without uttering a word, but in the evening she sent one"
5394,VERGIL.,of her maids to bring Ulysses secretly to her apartment in the palace.
5395,VERGIL.,"There she expressed her joy at meeting her countryman, and after"
5396,VERGIL.,"hospitably entertaining him, she listened with pleasure to his plans."
5397,VERGIL.,"She then told him of the plans of the Trojans, and where and how the"
5398,VERGIL.,Palladium was to be got. Having thus obtained the information he
5399,VERGIL.,"desired, Ulysses contrived to make his way back unobserved to the Greek"
5400,VERGIL.,"camp. In a few days he returned, accompanied by Diomede. They got into"
5401,VERGIL.,"the city by scaling the walls, and Diomede, climbing on the shoulders of"
5402,VERGIL.,"Ulysses, entered the citadel. Here, by following the directions given by"
5403,VERGIL.,"Helen, he found the famous statue, and he and his companion carried it"
5404,VERGIL.,"off to their friends at the ships, who rejoiced at the success of the"
5405,VERGIL.,undertaking.
5406,VERGIL.,
5407,VERGIL.,Troy was now no longer under the protection of Pallas Minerva. Though
5408,VERGIL.,"that goddess helped the Greeks in their battles, she was obliged to"
5409,VERGIL.,save the city itself while it contained her sacred statue. But the
5410,VERGIL.,"Palladium being no longer within the walls, she was now at liberty to"
5411,VERGIL.,help the Greeks to capture and destroy the city. She therefore put into
5412,VERGIL.,"the mind of Ulysses the idea of the wooden horse, and she instructed the"
5413,VERGIL.,"Greek chief E-peʹus how to make it. This horse was of vast size, large"
5414,VERGIL.,"enough to contain about a hundred men, for it was hollow within."
5415,VERGIL.,
5416,VERGIL.,"By Minerva's aid, a fabric reared,"
5417,VERGIL.,Which like a steed of monstrous height appeared;
5418,VERGIL.,The sides were flanked with pine.
5419,VERGIL.,
5420,VERGIL.,VERGIL.
5421,VERGIL.,
5422,VERGIL.,"When it was finished, provisions were put into it. Then Ulysses, and"
5423,VERGIL.,"Pyrrhus, and Menelaus, and Epeus, and a number of other Greek warriors,"
5424,VERGIL.,"mounted into it by means of a ladder, after which the opening was"
5425,VERGIL.,fastened by strong bolts.
5426,VERGIL.,
5427,VERGIL.,"In the hollow side,"
5428,VERGIL.,Selected numbers of their soldiers hide;

5432,VERGIL.,VERGIL.
5433,VERGIL.,
5434,VERGIL.,"Meanwhile the other Greeks broke up their camp, and all going aboard"
5435,VERGIL.,"their ships, they set sail, as if they had given up the siege, and were"
5436,VERGIL.,about to return to Greece. But they went no farther than the island of
5437,VERGIL.,"Tenʹe-dos, about three miles from the shore."
5438,VERGIL.,
5439,VERGIL.,"In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle"
5440,VERGIL.,(While Fortune did on Priam's empire smile)
5441,VERGIL.,"Renowned for wealth; but since, a faithless bay,"

5443,VERGIL.,There was their fleet concealed.
5444,VERGIL.,
5445,VERGIL.,VERGIL.
5446,VERGIL.,
5447,VERGIL.,As soon as the Trojans saw from their walls that the tents of the enemy
5448,VERGIL.,"were removed, and that their fleet had departed, they were filled with"
5449,VERGIL.,surprise and delight. They believed that the Greeks had given up the
5450,VERGIL.,"war, and so, throwing open their gates, they rushed out in multitudes"
5451,VERGIL.,"upon the plain, King Priam riding in his chariot at their head."
5452,VERGIL.,
5453,VERGIL.,"The Trojans, cooped within their walls so long,"
5454,VERGIL.,"Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng"

5457,VERGIL.,
5458,VERGIL.,VERGIL.
5459,VERGIL.,
5460,VERGIL.,"But soon their attention was attracted by the huge wooden horse, and"
5461,VERGIL.,"they gathered about it, astonished at its great size, and wondering what"
5462,VERGIL.,"it meant. Some thought that it meant evil to Troy, and advised that it"
5463,VERGIL.,should be burned; others proposed that it should be hauled into the city
5464,VERGIL.,"and placed within the citadel. La-ocʹo-on, one of Priam's sons, who was"
5465,VERGIL.,"also a priest of Apollo, cried out in a loud voice, warning the king"
5466,VERGIL.,"and people against doing this. ""Are you so foolish,"" he exclaimed, ""as"
5467,VERGIL.,to suppose that the enemy are gone? Put no faith in this horse. Whatever
5468,VERGIL.,"it is, I fear the Greeks even when offering gifts."""

5478,VERGIL.,
5479,VERGIL.,"Thus saying, Laocoon hurled his spear against the side of the horse, and"
5480,VERGIL.,it sent forth a hollow sound like a deep groan. But at this moment a
5481,VERGIL.,"stranger, having the appearance of a Greek, was brought before the king."
5482,VERGIL.,"Some Trojan shepherds, finding him loitering on the river bank, had made"
5483,VERGIL.,"him prisoner. Being asked who he was and why he was there, he told an"
5484,VERGIL.,"artful story. His name, he said, was Si'non, and he was a Greek. His"
5485,VERGIL.,"countrymen, having decided to give up the war, resolved to offer one of"
5486,VERGIL.,"themselves as a sacrifice to the gods, that they might get fair winds to"
5487,VERGIL.,"return home, and they selected him to be the victim. To escape that"
5488,VERGIL.,terrible fate he concealed himself among the reeds by the side of the
5489,VERGIL.,Scamander until the fleet departed. This was Sinon's account of
5490,VERGIL.,"himself. The Trojans believed it, and the prisoner was set free. But the"
5491,VERGIL.,"king asked him to tell them about the wooden horse,--why it had been"
5492,VERGIL.,"made, and left there upon the plain."
5493,VERGIL.,
5494,VERGIL.,Then Sinon told another false story. He said that the horse was a peace
5495,VERGIL.,"offering to Minerva, who had been angry because the Palladium was taken"
5496,VERGIL.,"from Troy. For that insult to her, the goddess commanded the Greeks to"
5497,VERGIL.,"return to their own country, and Calchas ordered them to build the horse"
5498,VERGIL.,as an atonement for their crime. He also told them to make it so large
5499,VERGIL.,that the Trojans might not be able to drag it within their gates; for if
5500,VERGIL.,"it were brought into the city, it would be a protection to Troy, but if"
5501,VERGIL.,"any harm were done to it, ruin would come on the kingdom of Priam."
5502,VERGIL.,
5503,VERGIL.,"""We raised and dedicate this wondrous frame,"
5504,VERGIL.,"So lofty, lest through your forbidden gates"
5505,VERGIL.,"It pass, and intercept our better fates;"
5506,VERGIL.,"For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost;"
5507,VERGIL.,And Troy may then a new Palladium boast

5516,VERGIL.,
5517,VERGIL.,VERGIL.
5518,VERGIL.,
5519,VERGIL.,"King Priam and the Trojans believed this story too, and a terrible thing"
5520,VERGIL.,which just then happened made them believe it all the more. After
5521,VERGIL.,"Laocoon had hurled his spear at the wooden horse, he and his two sons"
5522,VERGIL.,went to offer sacrifice to the gods at an altar erected on the beach.
5523,VERGIL.,"While they were thus engaged, two enormous serpents, darting out from"
5524,VERGIL.,"the sea, glided up to the altar, seized the priest and his sons, and"
5525,VERGIL.,crushed all three to death in their tremendous coils.
5526,VERGIL.,
5527,VERGIL.,"First around the tender boys they wind,"
5528,VERGIL.,Then with their sharpened fangs their limbs and bodies grind.

5537,VERGIL.,
5538,VERGIL.,The terrified Trojans regarded this awful event as a punishment sent by
5539,VERGIL.,the gods upon Laocoon for insulting Minerva by casting his spear at her
5540,VERGIL.,"gift, which they now believed the horse to be. They therefore resolved"
5541,VERGIL.,to take the huge figure into the city in spite of the advice of
5542,VERGIL.,"Cassandra, who also warned them that it would bring ruin upon Troy. And"
5543,VERGIL.,"so they made a great breach in the walls, for none of their gates were"
5544,VERGIL.,"large enough to admit the vast image, and fastening strong ropes to its"
5545,VERGIL.,feet they dragged it into the citadel. Then they decorated the temples
5546,VERGIL.,"with garlands of green boughs, and spent the remainder of the day in"
5547,VERGIL.,festivity and rejoicing.
5548,VERGIL.,
5549,VERGIL.,"But in the dead of the night, when they were all sunk in deep repose,"
5550,VERGIL.,the treacherous Sinon drew the bolts from the trapdoor in the side of
5551,VERGIL.,"the wooden horse, and out came the Greek warriors, rejoicing at the"
5552,VERGIL.,success of their stratagem.
5553,VERGIL.,
5554,VERGIL.,"Sinon next hurried down to the beach, and there kindled a fire as a"
5555,VERGIL.,"signal to his countrymen on the ships. They knew what it meant, for it"
5556,VERGIL.,"was part of the plan that had been agreed on. Quickly plying their oars,"
5557,VERGIL.,"they soon reached the shore, and, marching across the plain, the Greeks"
5558,VERGIL.,"poured in thousands into the streets, through the breach that had been"
5559,VERGIL.,made in the walls.
5560,VERGIL.,
5561,VERGIL.,"The Trojans, startled from their sleep by the noise, understood at once"
5562,VERGIL.,"what had happened. Hastily they rushed to arms, and, led and encouraged"
5563,VERGIL.,"by Æneas and other chiefs, they fought valiantly to drive out the enemy,"
5564,VERGIL.,but all their valor was in vain. Troy was at last taken. The victorious
5565,VERGIL.,"Greeks swept through the city, dealing death and destruction around"
5566,VERGIL.,"them. King Priam was slain by Pyrrhus, at the foot of the altar in one"
5567,VERGIL.,"of the temples, to which he fled for safety. His son Deiphobus, who had"
