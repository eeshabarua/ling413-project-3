46,CANTO XXIII,
47,CANTO XXIII,"IN silence and in solitude we went,"
48,CANTO XXIII,"One first, the other following his steps,"
49,CANTO XXIII,As minor friars journeying on their road.
50,CANTO XXIII,
51,CANTO XXIII,The present fray had turn'd my thoughts to muse
52,CANTO XXIII,"Upon old Aesop's fable, where he told"
53,CANTO XXIII,What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.
54,CANTO XXIII,"For language hath not sounds more like in sense,"
55,CANTO XXIII,"Than are these chances, if the origin"
56,CANTO XXIII,And end of each be heedfully compar'd.
57,CANTO XXIII,"And as one thought bursts from another forth,"
58,CANTO XXIII,"So afterward from that another sprang,"
59,CANTO XXIII,Which added doubly to my former fear.
60,CANTO XXIII,"For thus I reason'd: ""These through us have been"
61,CANTO XXIII,"So foil'd, with loss and mock'ry so complete,"
62,CANTO XXIII,As needs must sting them sore.  If anger then
63,CANTO XXIII,"Be to their evil will conjoin'd, more fell"
64,CANTO XXIII,"They shall pursue us, than the savage hound"
65,CANTO XXIII,"Snatches the leveret, panting 'twixt his jaws."""
66,CANTO XXIII,
67,CANTO XXIII,Already I perceiv'd my hair stand all
68,CANTO XXIII,"On end with terror, and look'd eager back."
69,CANTO XXIII,
70,CANTO XXIII,"""Teacher,"" I thus began, ""if speedily"
71,CANTO XXIII,"Thyself and me thou hide not, much I dread"
72,CANTO XXIII,Those evil talons.  Even now behind
73,CANTO XXIII,They urge us: quick imagination works
74,CANTO XXIII,"So forcibly, that I already feel them."""
75,CANTO XXIII,
76,CANTO XXIII,"He answer'd: ""Were I form'd of leaded glass,"
77,CANTO XXIII,I should not sooner draw unto myself
78,CANTO XXIII,"Thy outward image, than I now imprint"
79,CANTO XXIII,That from within.  This moment came thy thoughts
80,CANTO XXIII,"Presented before mine, with similar act"
81,CANTO XXIII,"And count'nance similar, so that from both"
82,CANTO XXIII,I one design have fram'd.  If the right coast
83,CANTO XXIII,"Incline so much, that we may thence descend"
84,CANTO XXIII,"Into the other chasm, we shall escape"
85,CANTO XXIII,"Secure from this imagined pursuit."""
86,CANTO XXIII,
87,CANTO XXIII,"He had not spoke his purpose to the end,"
88,CANTO XXIII,When I from far beheld them with spread wings
89,CANTO XXIII,Approach to take us.  Suddenly my guide
90,CANTO XXIII,"Caught me, ev'n as a mother that from sleep"
91,CANTO XXIII,"Is by the noise arous'd, and near her sees"
92,CANTO XXIII,"The climbing fires, who snatches up her babe"
93,CANTO XXIII,"And flies ne'er pausing, careful more of him"
94,CANTO XXIII,"Than of herself, that but a single vest"
95,CANTO XXIII,Clings round her limbs.  Down from the jutting beach
96,CANTO XXIII,"Supine he cast him, to that pendent rock,"
97,CANTO XXIII,Which closes on one part the other chasm.
98,CANTO XXIII,
99,CANTO XXIII,Never ran water with such hurrying pace
100,CANTO XXIII,"Adown the tube to turn a landmill's wheel,"
101,CANTO XXIII,"When nearest it approaches to the spokes,"
102,CANTO XXIII,"As then along that edge my master ran,"
103,CANTO XXIII,"Carrying me in his bosom, as a child,"
104,CANTO XXIII,Not a companion.  Scarcely had his feet
105,CANTO XXIII,"Reach'd to the lowest of the bed beneath,"
106,CANTO XXIII,
107,CANTO XXIII,When over us the steep they reach'd; but fear
108,CANTO XXIII,"In him was none; for that high Providence,"
109,CANTO XXIII,"Which plac'd them ministers of the fifth foss,"
110,CANTO XXIII,Power of departing thence took from them all.
111,CANTO XXIII,
112,CANTO XXIII,"There in the depth we saw a painted tribe,"
113,CANTO XXIII,"Who pac'd with tardy steps around, and wept,"
114,CANTO XXIII,Faint in appearance and o'ercome with toil.
115,CANTO XXIII,"Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down"
116,CANTO XXIII,"Before their eyes, in fashion like to those"
117,CANTO XXIII,Worn by the monks in Cologne.  Their outside
118,CANTO XXIII,"Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,"
119,CANTO XXIII,"But leaden all within, and of such weight,"
120,CANTO XXIII,That Frederick's compar'd to these were straw.
121,CANTO XXIII,"Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!"
122,CANTO XXIII,
123,CANTO XXIII,We yet once more with them together turn'd
124,CANTO XXIII,"To leftward, on their dismal moan intent."
125,CANTO XXIII,"But by the weight oppress'd, so slowly came"
126,CANTO XXIII,"The fainting people, that our company"
127,CANTO XXIII,Was chang'd at every movement of the step.
128,CANTO XXIII,
129,CANTO XXIII,"Whence I my guide address'd: ""See that thou find"
130,CANTO XXIII,"Some spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known,"
131,CANTO XXIII,"And to that end look round thee as thou go'st."""
132,CANTO XXIII,
133,CANTO XXIII,"Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice,"
134,CANTO XXIII,"Cried after us aloud: ""Hold in your feet,"
135,CANTO XXIII,Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air.
136,CANTO XXIII,"Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish."""
137,CANTO XXIII,
138,CANTO XXIII,"Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake:"
139,CANTO XXIII,"""Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed."""
140,CANTO XXIII,
141,CANTO XXIII,"I staid, and saw two Spirits in whose look"
142,CANTO XXIII,Impatient eagerness of mind was mark'd
143,CANTO XXIII,To overtake me; but the load they bare
144,CANTO XXIII,And narrow path retarded their approach.
145,CANTO XXIII,
146,CANTO XXIII,"Soon as arriv'd, they with an eye askance"
147,CANTO XXIII,"Perus'd me, but spake not: then turning each"
148,CANTO XXIII,"To other thus conferring said: ""This one"
149,CANTO XXIII,"Seems, by the action of his throat, alive."
150,CANTO XXIII,"And, be they dead, what privilege allows"
151,CANTO XXIII,"They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?"""
152,CANTO XXIII,
153,CANTO XXIII,"Then thus to me: ""Tuscan, who visitest"
154,CANTO XXIII,"The college of the mourning hypocrites,"
155,CANTO XXIII,"Disdain not to instruct us who thou art."""
156,CANTO XXIII,
157,CANTO XXIII,"""By Arno's pleasant stream,"" I thus replied,"
158,CANTO XXIII,"""In the great city I was bred and grew,"
159,CANTO XXIII,And wear the body I have ever worn.
160,CANTO XXIII,"but who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,"
161,CANTO XXIII,"As now I witness, courseth down your cheeks?"
162,CANTO XXIII,"What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe?"""
163,CANTO XXIII,"""Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,"""
164,CANTO XXIII,"One of them answer'd, ""are so leaden gross,"
165,CANTO XXIII,That with their weight they make the balances
166,CANTO XXIII,"To crack beneath them.  Joyous friars we were,"
167,CANTO XXIII,"Bologna's natives, Catalano I,"
168,CANTO XXIII,"He Loderingo nam'd, and by thy land"
169,CANTO XXIII,"Together taken, as men used to take"
170,CANTO XXIII,"A single and indifferent arbiter,"
171,CANTO XXIII,"To reconcile their strifes.  How there we sped,"
172,CANTO XXIII,"Gardingo's vicinage can best declare."""
173,CANTO XXIII,
174,CANTO XXIII,"""O friars!""  I began, ""your miseries--"""
175,CANTO XXIII,"But there brake off, for one had caught my eye,"
176,CANTO XXIII,Fix'd to a cross with three stakes on the ground:
177,CANTO XXIII,"He, when he saw me, writh'd himself, throughout"
178,CANTO XXIII,"Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard."
179,CANTO XXIII,"And Catalano, who thereof was 'ware,"
180,CANTO XXIII,
181,CANTO XXIII,"Thus spake: ""That pierced spirit, whom intent"
182,CANTO XXIII,"Thou view'st, was he who gave the Pharisees"
183,CANTO XXIII,"Counsel, that it were fitting for one man"
184,CANTO XXIII,To suffer for the people.  He doth lie
185,CANTO XXIII,"Transverse; nor any passes, but him first"
186,CANTO XXIII,Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs.
187,CANTO XXIII,In straits like this along the foss are plac'd
188,CANTO XXIII,"The father of his consort, and the rest"
189,CANTO XXIII,"Partakers in that council, seed of ill"
190,CANTO XXIII,"And sorrow to the Jews.""  I noted then,"
191,CANTO XXIII,"How Virgil gaz'd with wonder upon him,"
192,CANTO XXIII,Thus abjectly extended on the cross
193,CANTO XXIII,In banishment eternal.  To the friar
194,CANTO XXIII,"He next his words address'd: ""We pray ye tell,"
195,CANTO XXIII,"If so be lawful, whether on our right"
196,CANTO XXIII,"Lies any opening in the rock, whereby"
197,CANTO XXIII,"We both may issue hence, without constraint"
198,CANTO XXIII,"On the dark angels, that compell'd they come"
199,CANTO XXIII,"To lead us from this depth.""  He thus replied:"
200,CANTO XXIII,"""Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock"
201,CANTO XXIII,"From the next circle moving, which o'ersteps"
202,CANTO XXIII,"Each vale of horror, save that here his cope"
203,CANTO XXIII,Is shatter'd.  By the ruin ye may mount:
204,CANTO XXIII,"For on the side it slants, and most the height"
205,CANTO XXIII,"Rises below.""  With head bent down awhile"
206,CANTO XXIII,"My leader stood, then spake: ""He warn'd us ill,"
207,CANTO XXIII,"Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook."""
208,CANTO XXIII,
209,CANTO XXIII,To whom the friar: At Bologna erst
210,CANTO XXIII,"""I many vices of the devil heard,"
211,CANTO XXIII,"Among the rest was said, 'He is a liar,"
212,CANTO XXIII,"And the father of lies!'""  When he had spoke,"
213,CANTO XXIII,"My leader with large strides proceeded on,"
214,CANTO XXIII,Somewhat disturb'd with anger in his look.
215,CANTO XXIII,
216,CANTO XXIII,"I therefore left the spirits heavy laden,"
217,CANTO XXIII,"And following, his beloved footsteps mark'd."
218,CANTO XXIII,
219,CANTO XXIII,
220,CANTO XXIII,
221,CANTO XXIII,
222,CANTO XXIV,CANTO XXIV
223,CANTO XXIV,
224,CANTO XXIV,"IN the year's early nonage, when the sun"
225,CANTO XXIV,"Tempers his tresses in Aquarius' urn,"
226,CANTO XXIV,"And now towards equal day the nights recede,"
227,CANTO XXIV,When as the rime upon the earth puts on
228,CANTO XXIV,"Her dazzling sister's image, but not long"
229,CANTO XXIV,"Her milder sway endures, then riseth up"
230,CANTO XXIV,"The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,"
231,CANTO XXIV,And looking out beholds the plain around
232,CANTO XXIV,"All whiten'd, whence impatiently he smites"
233,CANTO XXIV,"His thighs, and to his hut returning in,"
234,CANTO XXIV,"There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,"
235,CANTO XXIV,As a discomfited and helpless man;
236,CANTO XXIV,"Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope"
237,CANTO XXIV,"Spring in his bosom, finding e'en thus soon"
238,CANTO XXIV,"The world hath chang'd its count'nance, grasps his crook,"
239,CANTO XXIV,And forth to pasture drives his little flock:
240,CANTO XXIV,So me my guide dishearten'd when I saw
241,CANTO XXIV,"His troubled forehead, and so speedily"
242,CANTO XXIV,That ill was cur'd; for at the fallen bridge
243,CANTO XXIV,"Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,"
244,CANTO XXIV,"He turn'd him back, as that I first beheld"
245,CANTO XXIV,At the steep mountain's foot.  Regarding well
246,CANTO XXIV,"The ruin, and some counsel first maintain'd"
247,CANTO XXIV,"With his own thought, he open'd wide his arm"
248,CANTO XXIV,"And took me up.  As one, who, while he works,"
249,CANTO XXIV,"Computes his labour's issue, that he seems"
250,CANTO XXIV,"Still to foresee the' effect, so lifting me"
251,CANTO XXIV,"Up to the summit of one peak, he fix'd"
252,CANTO XXIV,"His eye upon another.  ""Grapple that,"""
253,CANTO XXIV,"Said he, ""but first make proof, if it be such"
254,CANTO XXIV,"As will sustain thee.""  For one capp'd with lead"
255,CANTO XXIV,"This were no journey.  Scarcely he, though light,"
256,CANTO XXIV,"And I, though onward push'd from crag to crag,"
257,CANTO XXIV,Could mount.  And if the precinct of this coast
258,CANTO XXIV,"Were not less ample than the last, for him"
259,CANTO XXIV,"I know not, but my strength had surely fail'd."
260,CANTO XXIV,But Malebolge all toward the mouth
261,CANTO XXIV,"Inclining of the nethermost abyss,"
262,CANTO XXIV,"The site of every valley hence requires,"
263,CANTO XXIV,"That one side upward slope, the other fall."
264,CANTO XXIV,
265,CANTO XXIV,At length the point of our descent we reach'd
266,CANTO XXIV,"From the last flag: soon as to that arriv'd,"
267,CANTO XXIV,"So was the breath exhausted from my lungs,"
268,CANTO XXIV,"I could no further, but did seat me there."
269,CANTO XXIV,
270,CANTO XXIV,"""Now needs thy best of man;"" so spake my guide:"
271,CANTO XXIV,"""For not on downy plumes, nor under shade"
272,CANTO XXIV,"Of canopy reposing, fame is won,"
273,CANTO XXIV,Without which whosoe'er consumes his days
274,CANTO XXIV,"Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth,"
275,CANTO XXIV,As smoke in air or foam upon the wave.
276,CANTO XXIV,Thou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness
277,CANTO XXIV,"By the mind's effort, in each struggle form'd"
278,CANTO XXIV,"To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight"
279,CANTO XXIV,Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.
280,CANTO XXIV,A longer ladder yet remains to scale.
281,CANTO XXIV,From these to have escap'd sufficeth not.
282,CANTO XXIV,"If well thou note me, profit by my words."""
283,CANTO XXIV,
284,CANTO XXIV,"I straightway rose, and show'd myself less spent"
285,CANTO XXIV,"Than I in truth did feel me.  ""On,"" I cried,"
286,CANTO XXIV,"""For I am stout and fearless.""  Up the rock"
287,CANTO XXIV,"Our way we held, more rugged than before,"
288,CANTO XXIV,Narrower and steeper far to climb.  From talk
289,CANTO XXIV,"I ceas'd not, as we journey'd, so to seem"
290,CANTO XXIV,Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss
291,CANTO XXIV,"Did issue forth, for utt'rance suited ill."
292,CANTO XXIV,"Though on the arch that crosses there I stood,"
293,CANTO XXIV,"What were the words I knew not, but who spake"
294,CANTO XXIV,"Seem'd mov'd in anger.  Down I stoop'd to look,"
295,CANTO XXIV,But my quick eye might reach not to the depth
296,CANTO XXIV,For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:
297,CANTO XXIV,"""To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,"
298,CANTO XXIV,And from the wall dismount we; for as hence
299,CANTO XXIV,"I hear and understand not, so I see"
300,CANTO XXIV,"Beneath, and naught discern.""--""I answer not,"""
301,CANTO XXIV,"Said he, ""but by the deed.  To fair request"
302,CANTO XXIV,"Silent performance maketh best return."""
303,CANTO XXIV,
304,CANTO XXIV,"We from the bridge's head descended, where"
305,CANTO XXIV,"To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm"
306,CANTO XXIV,"Opening to view, I saw a crowd within"
307,CANTO XXIV,"Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape"
308,CANTO XXIV,"And hideous, that remembrance in my veins"
309,CANTO XXIV,Yet shrinks the vital current.  Of her sands
310,CANTO XXIV,"Let Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,"
311,CANTO XXIV,"Pareas and Chelyder be her brood,"
312,CANTO XXIV,"Cenchris and Amphisboena, plagues so dire"
313,CANTO XXIV,"Or in such numbers swarming ne'er she shew'd,"
314,CANTO XXIV,"Not with all Ethiopia, and whate'er"
315,CANTO XXIV,Above the Erythraean sea is spawn'd.
316,CANTO XXIV,
317,CANTO XXIV,Amid this dread exuberance of woe
318,CANTO XXIV,"Ran naked spirits wing'd with horrid fear,"
319,CANTO XXIV,"Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,"
320,CANTO XXIV,Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.
321,CANTO XXIV,"With serpents were their hands behind them bound,"
322,CANTO XXIV,Which through their reins infix'd the tail and head
323,CANTO XXIV,Twisted in folds before.  And lo! on one
324,CANTO XXIV,"Near to our side, darted an adder up,"
325,CANTO XXIV,"And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,"
326,CANTO XXIV,Transpierc'd him.  Far more quickly than e'er pen
327,CANTO XXIV,"Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn'd, and chang'd"
328,CANTO XXIV,"To ashes, all pour'd out upon the earth."
329,CANTO XXIV,"When there dissolv'd he lay, the dust again"
330,CANTO XXIV,"Uproll'd spontaneous, and the self-same form"
331,CANTO XXIV,"Instant resumed.  So mighty sages tell,"
332,CANTO XXIV,"The' Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years"
333,CANTO XXIV,"Have well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith"
334,CANTO XXIV,Renascent.  Blade nor herb throughout his life
335,CANTO XXIV,"He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone"
336,CANTO XXIV,And odorous amomum: swaths of nard
337,CANTO XXIV,"And myrrh his funeral shroud.  As one that falls,"
338,CANTO XXIV,"He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg'd"
339,CANTO XXIV,"To earth, or through obstruction fettering up"
340,CANTO XXIV,"In chains invisible the powers of man,"
341,CANTO XXIV,"Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around,"
342,CANTO XXIV,Bewilder'd with the monstrous agony
343,CANTO XXIV,"He hath endur'd, and wildly staring sighs;"
344,CANTO XXIV,So stood aghast the sinner when he rose.
345,CANTO XXIV,
346,CANTO XXIV,"Oh! how severe God's judgment, that deals out"
347,CANTO XXIV,Such blows in stormy vengeance!  Who he was
348,CANTO XXIV,"My teacher next inquir'd, and thus in few"
349,CANTO XXIV,"He answer'd: ""Vanni Fucci am I call'd,"
350,CANTO XXIV,Not long since rained down from Tuscany
351,CANTO XXIV,To this dire gullet.  Me the beastial life
352,CANTO XXIV,"And not the human pleas'd, mule that I was,"
353,CANTO XXIV,"Who in Pistoia found my worthy den."""
354,CANTO XXIV,
355,CANTO XXIV,"I then to Virgil: ""Bid him stir not hence,"
356,CANTO XXIV,And ask what crime did thrust him hither: once
357,CANTO XXIV,"A man I knew him choleric and bloody."""
358,CANTO XXIV,
359,CANTO XXIV,"The sinner heard and feign'd not, but towards me"
360,CANTO XXIV,"His mind directing and his face, wherein"
361,CANTO XXIV,"Was dismal shame depictur'd, thus he spake:"
362,CANTO XXIV,"""It grieves me more to have been caught by thee"
363,CANTO XXIV,"In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than"
364,CANTO XXIV,When I was taken from the other life.
365,CANTO XXIV,I have no power permitted to deny
366,CANTO XXIV,What thou inquirest.  I am doom'd thus low
367,CANTO XXIV,"To dwell, for that the sacristy by me"
368,CANTO XXIV,"Was rifled of its goodly ornaments,"
369,CANTO XXIV,And with the guilt another falsely charged.
370,CANTO XXIV,"But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,"
371,CANTO XXIV,So as thou e'er shalt 'scape this darksome realm
372,CANTO XXIV,Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.
373,CANTO XXIV,"Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines,"
374,CANTO XXIV,Then Florence changeth citizens and laws.
375,CANTO XXIV,"From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,"
376,CANTO XXIV,"A vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists,"
377,CANTO XXIV,And sharp and eager driveth on the storm
378,CANTO XXIV,"With arrowy hurtling o'er Piceno's field,"
379,CANTO XXIV,"Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike"
380,CANTO XXIV,Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.
381,CANTO XXIV,"This have I told, that grief may rend thy heart."""
382,CANTO XXIV,

384,CANTO XXIV,
385,CANTO XXIV,
386,CANTO XXV,CANTO XXV
387,CANTO XXV,
388,CANTO XXV,"WHEN he had spoke, the sinner rais'd his hands"
389,CANTO XXV,"Pointed in mockery, and cried: ""Take them, God!"
390,CANTO XXV,"I level them at thee!""  From that day forth"
391,CANTO XXV,The serpents were my friends; for round his neck
392,CANTO XXV,"One of then rolling twisted, as it said,"
393,CANTO XXV,"""Be silent, tongue!""  Another to his arms"
394,CANTO XXV,"Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself"
395,CANTO XXV,"So close, it took from them the power to move."
396,CANTO XXV,
397,CANTO XXV,Pistoia!  Ah Pistoia! why dost doubt
398,CANTO XXV,"To turn thee into ashes, cumb'ring earth"
399,CANTO XXV,"No longer, since in evil act so far"
400,CANTO XXV,"Thou hast outdone thy seed?  I did not mark,"
401,CANTO XXV,"Through all the gloomy circles of the' abyss,"
402,CANTO XXV,"Spirit, that swell'd so proudly 'gainst his God,"
403,CANTO XXV,"Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes.  He fled,"
404,CANTO XXV,Nor utter'd more; and after him there came
405,CANTO XXV,"A centaur full of fury, shouting, ""Where"
406,CANTO XXV,"Where is the caitiff?""  On Maremma's marsh"
407,CANTO XXV,"Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch"
408,CANTO XXV,"They swarm'd, to where the human face begins."
409,CANTO XXV,"Behind his head upon the shoulders lay,"
410,CANTO XXV,"With open wings, a dragon breathing fire"
411,CANTO XXV,On whomsoe'er he met.  To me my guide:
412,CANTO XXV,"""Cacus is this, who underneath the rock"
413,CANTO XXV,Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.
414,CANTO XXV,"He, from his brethren parted, here must tread"
415,CANTO XXV,"A different journey, for his fraudful theft"
416,CANTO XXV,"Of the great herd, that near him stall'd; whence found"
417,CANTO XXV,"His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace"
418,CANTO XXV,"Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on"
419,CANTO XXV,"A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt."""
420,CANTO XXV,
421,CANTO XXV,"While yet he spake, the centaur sped away:"
422,CANTO XXV,"And under us three spirits came, of whom"
423,CANTO XXV,"Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim'd;"
424,CANTO XXV,"""Say who are ye?""  We then brake off discourse,"
425,CANTO XXV,Intent on these alone.  I knew them not;
426,CANTO XXV,"But, as it chanceth oft, befell, that one"
427,CANTO XXV,"Had need to name another.  ""Where,"" said he,"
428,CANTO XXV,"""Doth Cianfa lurk?""  I, for a sign my guide"
429,CANTO XXV,"Should stand attentive, plac'd against my lips"
430,CANTO XXV,"The finger lifted.  If, O reader! now"
431,CANTO XXV,"Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,"
432,CANTO XXV,No marvel; for myself do scarce allow
433,CANTO XXV,The witness of mine eyes.  But as I looked
434,CANTO XXV,"Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet"
435,CANTO XXV,"Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:"
436,CANTO XXV,"His midmost grasp'd the belly, a forefoot"
437,CANTO XXV,Seiz'd on each arm (while deep in either cheek
438,CANTO XXV,He flesh'd his fangs); the hinder on the thighs
439,CANTO XXV,"Were spread, 'twixt which the tail inserted curl'd"
440,CANTO XXV,Upon the reins behind.  Ivy ne'er clasp'd
441,CANTO XXV,"A dodder'd oak, as round the other's limbs"
442,CANTO XXV,The hideous monster intertwin'd his own.
443,CANTO XXV,"Then, as they both had been of burning wax,"
444,CANTO XXV,"Each melted into other, mingling hues,"
445,CANTO XXV,That which was either now was seen no more.
446,CANTO XXV,"Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,"
447,CANTO XXV,"A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,"
448,CANTO XXV,And the clean white expires.  The other two
449,CANTO XXV,"Look'd on exclaiming: ""Ah, how dost thou change,"
450,CANTO XXV,"Agnello!  See!  Thou art nor double now,"
451,CANTO XXV,
452,CANTO XXV,"""Nor only one.""  The two heads now became"
453,CANTO XXV,"One, and two figures blended in one form"
454,CANTO XXV,"Appear'd, where both were lost.  Of the four lengths"
455,CANTO XXV,Two arms were made: the belly and the chest
456,CANTO XXV,"The thighs and legs into such members chang'd,"
457,CANTO XXV,As never eye hath seen.  Of former shape
458,CANTO XXV,All trace was vanish'd.  Two yet neither seem'd
459,CANTO XXV,"That image miscreate, and so pass'd on"
460,CANTO XXV,With tardy steps.  As underneath the scourge
461,CANTO XXV,"Of the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,"
462,CANTO XXV,"Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems"
463,CANTO XXV,"A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,"
464,CANTO XXV,So toward th' entrails of the other two
465,CANTO XXV,"Approaching seem'd, an adder all on fire,"
466,CANTO XXV,"As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart."
467,CANTO XXV,"In that part, whence our life is nourish'd first,"
468,CANTO XXV,One he transpierc'd; then down before him fell
469,CANTO XXV,Stretch'd out.  The pierced spirit look'd on him
470,CANTO XXV,"But spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn'd,"
471,CANTO XXV,As if by sleep or fev'rous fit assail'd.
472,CANTO XXV,"He ey'd the serpent, and the serpent him."
473,CANTO XXV,"One from the wound, the other from the mouth"
474,CANTO XXV,"Breath'd a thick smoke, whose vap'ry columns join'd."
475,CANTO XXV,
476,CANTO XXV,"Lucan in mute attention now may hear,"
477,CANTO XXV,"Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus! tell,"
478,CANTO XXV,"Nor shine, Nasidius!  Ovid now be mute."
479,CANTO XXV,What if in warbling fiction he record
480,CANTO XXV,"Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake"
481,CANTO XXV,"Him chang'd, and her into a fountain clear,"
482,CANTO XXV,I envy not; for never face to face
483,CANTO XXV,"Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,"
484,CANTO XXV,Wherein both shapes were ready to assume
485,CANTO XXV,The other's substance.  They in mutual guise
486,CANTO XXV,"So answer'd, that the serpent split his train"
487,CANTO XXV,"Divided to a fork, and the pierc'd spirit"
488,CANTO XXV,"Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs"
489,CANTO XXV,"Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon"
490,CANTO XXV,Was visible: the tail disparted took
491,CANTO XXV,"The figure which the spirit lost, its skin"
492,CANTO XXV,"Soft'ning, his indurated to a rind."
493,CANTO XXV,"The shoulders next I mark'd, that ent'ring join'd"
494,CANTO XXV,"The monster's arm-pits, whose two shorter feet"
495,CANTO XXV,"So lengthen'd, as the other's dwindling shrunk."
496,CANTO XXV,The feet behind then twisting up became
497,CANTO XXV,"That part that man conceals, which in the wretch"
498,CANTO XXV,Was cleft in twain.  While both the shadowy smoke
499,CANTO XXV,"With a new colour veils, and generates"
500,CANTO XXV,"Th' excrescent pile on one, peeling it off"
501,CANTO XXV,"From th' other body, lo! upon his feet"
502,CANTO XXV,"One upright rose, and prone the other fell."
503,CANTO XXV,Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps
504,CANTO XXV,"Were shifted, though each feature chang'd beneath."
505,CANTO XXV,"Of him who stood erect, the mounting face"
506,CANTO XXV,"Retreated towards the temples, and what there"
507,CANTO XXV,"Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears"
508,CANTO XXV,"From the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg'd,"
509,CANTO XXV,Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell'd
510,CANTO XXV,Into due size protuberant the lips.
511,CANTO XXV,"He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends"
512,CANTO XXV,"His sharpen'd visage, and draws down the ears"
513,CANTO XXV,"Into the head, as doth the slug his horns."
514,CANTO XXV,His tongue continuous before and apt
515,CANTO XXV,"For utt'rance, severs; and the other's fork"
516,CANTO XXV,Closing unites.  That done the smoke was laid.
517,CANTO XXV,"The soul, transform'd into the brute, glides off,"
518,CANTO XXV,"Hissing along the vale, and after him"
519,CANTO XXV,The other talking sputters; but soon turn'd
520,CANTO XXV,"His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few"
521,CANTO XXV,"Thus to another spake: ""Along this path"
522,CANTO XXV,"Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!"""
523,CANTO XXV,
524,CANTO XXV,So saw I fluctuate in successive change
525,CANTO XXV,Th' unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:
526,CANTO XXV,"And here if aught my tongue have swerv'd, events"
527,CANTO XXV,So strange may be its warrant.  O'er mine eyes
528,CANTO XXV,"Confusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze."
529,CANTO XXV,
530,CANTO XXV,"Yet 'scap'd they not so covertly, but well"
531,CANTO XXV,I mark'd Sciancato: he alone it was
532,CANTO XXV,"Of the three first that came, who chang'd not: thou,"
533,CANTO XXV,"The other's fate, Gaville, still dost rue."
534,CANTO XXV,
535,CANTO XXV,
536,CANTO XXV,
537,CANTO XXV,
538,CANTO XXVI,CANTO XXVI
539,CANTO XXVI,
540,CANTO XXVI,FLORENCE exult! for thou so mightily
541,CANTO XXVI,"Hast thriven, that o'er land and sea thy wings"
542,CANTO XXVI,"Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell!"
543,CANTO XXVI,Among the plund'rers such the three I found
544,CANTO XXVI,"Thy citizens, whence shame to me thy son,"
545,CANTO XXVI,And no proud honour to thyself redounds.
546,CANTO XXVI,
547,CANTO XXVI,"But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn,"
548,CANTO XXVI,"Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long"
549,CANTO XXVI,"Shalt feel what Prato, (not to say the rest)"
550,CANTO XXVI,Would fain might come upon thee; and that chance
551,CANTO XXVI,"Were in good time, if it befell thee now."
552,CANTO XXVI,"Would so it were, since it must needs befall!"
553,CANTO XXVI,"For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more."
554,CANTO XXVI,
555,CANTO XXVI,We from the depth departed; and my guide
556,CANTO XXVI,"Remounting scal'd the flinty steps, which late"
557,CANTO XXVI,"We downward trac'd, and drew me up the steep."
558,CANTO XXVI,Pursuing thus our solitary way
559,CANTO XXVI,"Among the crags and splinters of the rock,"
560,CANTO XXVI,Sped not our feet without the help of hands.
561,CANTO XXVI,
562,CANTO XXVI,"Then sorrow seiz'd me, which e'en now revives,"
563,CANTO XXVI,"As my thought turns again to what I saw,"
564,CANTO XXVI,"And, more than I am wont, I rein and curb"
565,CANTO XXVI,"The powers of nature in me, lest they run"
566,CANTO XXVI,Where Virtue guides not; that if aught of good
567,CANTO XXVI,"My gentle star, or something better gave me,"
568,CANTO XXVI,I envy not myself the precious boon.
569,CANTO XXVI,
570,CANTO XXVI,"As in that season, when the sun least veils"
571,CANTO XXVI,"His face that lightens all, what time the fly"
572,CANTO XXVI,"Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then"
573,CANTO XXVI,"Upon some cliff reclin'd, beneath him sees"
574,CANTO XXVI,"Fire-flies innumerous spangling o'er the vale,"
575,CANTO XXVI,"Vineyard or tilth, where his day-labour lies:"
576,CANTO XXVI,With flames so numberless throughout its space
577,CANTO XXVI,"Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth"
578,CANTO XXVI,"Was to my view expos'd. As he, whose wrongs"
579,CANTO XXVI,"The bears aveng'd, at its departure saw"
580,CANTO XXVI,"Elijah's chariot, when the steeds erect"
581,CANTO XXVI,"Rais'd their steep flight for heav'n; his eyes meanwhile,"
582,CANTO XXVI,"Straining pursu'd them, till the flame alone"
583,CANTO XXVI,Upsoaring like a misty speck he kenn'd;
584,CANTO XXVI,"E'en thus along the gulf moves every flame,"
585,CANTO XXVI,"A sinner so enfolded close in each,"
586,CANTO XXVI,That none exhibits token of the theft.
587,CANTO XXVI,
588,CANTO XXVI,"Upon the bridge I forward bent to look,"
589,CANTO XXVI,"And grasp'd a flinty mass, or else had fall'n,"
590,CANTO XXVI,"Though push'd not from the height.  The guide, who mark'd"
591,CANTO XXVI,"How I did gaze attentive, thus began:"
592,CANTO XXVI,
593,CANTO XXVI,"""Within these ardours are the spirits, each"
594,CANTO XXVI,"Swath'd in confining fire.""--""Master, thy word,"""
595,CANTO XXVI,"I answer'd, ""hath assur'd me; yet I deem'd"
596,CANTO XXVI,"Already of the truth, already wish'd"
597,CANTO XXVI,"To ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes"
598,CANTO XXVI,"So parted at the summit, as it seem'd"
599,CANTO XXVI,"Ascending from that funeral pile, where lay"
600,CANTO XXVI,"The Theban brothers?""  He replied: ""Within"
601,CANTO XXVI,Ulysses there and Diomede endure
602,CANTO XXVI,"Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now"
603,CANTO XXVI,"Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath."
604,CANTO XXVI,These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore
605,CANTO XXVI,"The ambush of the horse, that open'd wide"
606,CANTO XXVI,"A portal for that goodly seed to pass,"
607,CANTO XXVI,Which sow'd imperial Rome; nor less the guile
608,CANTO XXVI,"Lament they, whence of her Achilles 'reft"
609,CANTO XXVI,Deidamia yet in death complains.
610,CANTO XXVI,"And there is rued the stratagem, that Troy"
611,CANTO XXVI,"Of her Palladium spoil'd.""--""If they have power"
612,CANTO XXVI,"Of utt'rance from within these sparks,"" said I,"
613,CANTO XXVI,"""O master! think my prayer a thousand fold"
614,CANTO XXVI,"In repetition urg'd, that thou vouchsafe"
615,CANTO XXVI,"To pause, till here the horned flame arrive."
616,CANTO XXVI,"See, how toward it with desire I bend."""
617,CANTO XXVI,
618,CANTO XXVI,"He thus: ""Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,"
619,CANTO XXVI,And I accept it therefore: but do thou
620,CANTO XXVI,"Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine,"
621,CANTO XXVI,"For I divine thy wish: and they perchance,"
622,CANTO XXVI,"For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee."""
623,CANTO XXVI,
624,CANTO XXVI,"When there the flame had come, where time and place"
625,CANTO XXVI,"Seem'd fitting to my guide, he thus began:"
626,CANTO XXVI,"""O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!"
627,CANTO XXVI,"If living I of you did merit aught,"
628,CANTO XXVI,"Whate'er the measure were of that desert,"
629,CANTO XXVI,"When in the world my lofty strain I pour'd,"
630,CANTO XXVI,"Move ye not on, till one of you unfold"
631,CANTO XXVI,"In what clime death o'ertook him self-destroy'd."""
632,CANTO XXVI,
633,CANTO XXVI,Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn
634,CANTO XXVI,"Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire"
635,CANTO XXVI,"That labours with the wind, then to and fro"
636,CANTO XXVI,"Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,"
637,CANTO XXVI,"Threw out its voice, and spake: ""When I escap'd"
638,CANTO XXVI,"From Circe, who beyond a circling year"
639,CANTO XXVI,"Had held me near Caieta, by her charms,"
640,CANTO XXVI,"Ere thus Aeneas yet had nam'd the shore,"
641,CANTO XXVI,"Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence"
642,CANTO XXVI,"Of my old father, nor return of love,"
643,CANTO XXVI,"That should have crown'd Penelope with joy,"
644,CANTO XXVI,Could overcome in me the zeal I had
645,CANTO XXVI,"T' explore the world, and search the ways of life,"
646,CANTO XXVI,Man's evil and his virtue.  Forth I sail'd
647,CANTO XXVI,"Into the deep illimitable main,"
648,CANTO XXVI,"With but one bark, and the small faithful band"
649,CANTO XXVI,"That yet cleav'd to me.  As Iberia far,"
650,CANTO XXVI,"Far as Morocco either shore I saw,"
651,CANTO XXVI,And the Sardinian and each isle beside
652,CANTO XXVI,Which round that ocean bathes.  Tardy with age
653,CANTO XXVI,"Were I and my companions, when we came"
654,CANTO XXVI,"To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain'd"
655,CANTO XXVI,The bound'ries not to be o'erstepp'd by man.
656,CANTO XXVI,"The walls of Seville to my right I left,"
657,CANTO XXVI,On the' other hand already Ceuta past.
658,CANTO XXVI,
659,CANTO XXVI,"""O brothers!""  I began, ""who to the west"
660,CANTO XXVI,"Through perils without number now have reach'd,"
661,CANTO XXVI,"To this the short remaining watch, that yet"
662,CANTO XXVI,"Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof"
663,CANTO XXVI,"Of the unpeopled world, following the track"
664,CANTO XXVI,Of Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:
665,CANTO XXVI,Ye were not form'd to live the life of brutes
666,CANTO XXVI,But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.
667,CANTO XXVI,With these few words I sharpen'd for the voyage
668,CANTO XXVI,"The mind of my associates, that I then"
669,CANTO XXVI,Could scarcely have withheld them.  To the dawn
670,CANTO XXVI,"Our poop we turn'd, and for the witless flight"
671,CANTO XXVI,"Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left."
672,CANTO XXVI,"Each star of the' other pole night now beheld,"
673,CANTO XXVI,"And ours so low, that from the ocean-floor"
674,CANTO XXVI,"It rose not.  Five times re-illum'd, as oft"
675,CANTO XXVI,Vanish'd the light from underneath the moon
676,CANTO XXVI,"Since the deep way we enter'd, when from far"
677,CANTO XXVI,"Appear'd a mountain dim, loftiest methought"
678,CANTO XXVI,"Of all I e'er beheld.  Joy seiz'd us straight,"
679,CANTO XXVI,But soon to mourning changed.  From the new land
680,CANTO XXVI,"A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side"
681,CANTO XXVI,Did strike the vessel.  Thrice it whirl'd her round
682,CANTO XXVI,"With all the waves, the fourth time lifted up"
683,CANTO XXVI,"The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:"
684,CANTO XXVI,"And over us the booming billow clos'd."""

702,CANTO XVII,"Nor avenue immediate through the flame,"
703,CANTO XVII,Into its language turn'd the dismal words:

731,CANTO XVII,"Ravenna hath maintain'd this many a year,"
732,CANTO XVII,"Is steadfast.  There Polenta's eagle broods,"
