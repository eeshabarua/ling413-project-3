36,CANTO I,
37,CANTO I,O'er better waves to speed her rapid course
38,CANTO I,"The light bark of my genius lifts the sail,"
39,CANTO I,Well pleas'd to leave so cruel sea behind;
40,CANTO I,"And of that second region will I sing,"
41,CANTO I,In which the human spirit from sinful blot
42,CANTO I,"Is purg'd, and for ascent to Heaven prepares."
43,CANTO I,
44,CANTO I,"Here, O ye hallow'd Nine! for in your train"
45,CANTO I,"I follow, here the deadened strain revive;"
46,CANTO I,Nor let Calliope refuse to sound
47,CANTO I,"A somewhat higher song, of that loud tone,"
48,CANTO I,Which when the wretched birds of chattering note
49,CANTO I,"Had heard, they of forgiveness lost all hope."
50,CANTO I,
51,CANTO I,"Sweet hue of eastern sapphire, that was spread"
52,CANTO I,"O'er the serene aspect of the pure air,"
53,CANTO I,"High up as the first circle, to mine eyes"
54,CANTO I,"Unwonted joy renew'd, soon as I 'scap'd"
55,CANTO I,"Forth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom,"
56,CANTO I,That had mine eyes and bosom fill'd with grief.
57,CANTO I,"The radiant planet, that to love invites,"
58,CANTO I,"Made all the orient laugh, and veil'd beneath"
59,CANTO I,"The Pisces' light, that in his escort came."
60,CANTO I,
61,CANTO I,"To the right hand I turn'd, and fix'd my mind"
62,CANTO I,"On the' other pole attentive, where I saw"
63,CANTO I,Four stars ne'er seen before save by the ken
64,CANTO I,Of our first parents.  Heaven of their rays
65,CANTO I,"Seem'd joyous.  O thou northern site, bereft"
66,CANTO I,"Indeed, and widow'd, since of these depriv'd!"
67,CANTO I,
68,CANTO I,"As from this view I had desisted, straight"
69,CANTO I,"Turning a little tow'rds the other pole,"
70,CANTO I,"There from whence now the wain had disappear'd,"
71,CANTO I,I saw an old man standing by my side
72,CANTO I,"Alone, so worthy of rev'rence in his look,"
73,CANTO I,That ne'er from son to father more was ow'd.
74,CANTO I,Low down his beard and mix'd with hoary white
75,CANTO I,"Descended, like his locks, which parting fell"
76,CANTO I,Upon his breast in double fold.  The beams
77,CANTO I,Of those four luminaries on his face
78,CANTO I,"So brightly shone, and with such radiance clear"
79,CANTO I,"Deck'd it, that I beheld him as the sun."
80,CANTO I,
81,CANTO I,"""Say who are ye, that stemming the blind stream,"
82,CANTO I,"Forth from th' eternal prison-house have fled?"""
83,CANTO I,He spoke and moved those venerable plumes.
84,CANTO I,"""Who hath conducted, or with lantern sure"
85,CANTO I,"Lights you emerging from the depth of night,"
86,CANTO I,That makes the infernal valley ever black?
87,CANTO I,Are the firm statutes of the dread abyss
88,CANTO I,"Broken, or in high heaven new laws ordain'd,"
89,CANTO I,"That thus, condemn'd, ye to my caves approach?"""
90,CANTO I,
91,CANTO I,"My guide, then laying hold on me, by words"
92,CANTO I,"And intimations given with hand and head,"
93,CANTO I,Made my bent knees and eye submissive pay
94,CANTO I,Due reverence; then thus to him replied.
95,CANTO I,
96,CANTO I,"""Not of myself I come; a Dame from heaven"
97,CANTO I,"Descending, had besought me in my charge"
98,CANTO I,"To bring.  But since thy will implies, that more"
99,CANTO I,"Our true condition I unfold at large,"
100,CANTO I,Mine is not to deny thee thy request.
101,CANTO I,This mortal ne'er hath seen the farthest gloom.
102,CANTO I,But erring by his folly had approach'd
103,CANTO I,"So near, that little space was left to turn."
104,CANTO I,"Then, as before I told, I was dispatch'd"
105,CANTO I,"To work his rescue, and no way remain'd"
106,CANTO I,Save this which I have ta'en.  I have display'd
107,CANTO I,Before him all the regions of the bad;
108,CANTO I,"And purpose now those spirits to display,"
109,CANTO I,That under thy command are purg'd from sin.
110,CANTO I,How I have brought him would be long to say.
111,CANTO I,"From high descends the virtue, by whose aid"
112,CANTO I,I to thy sight and hearing him have led.
113,CANTO I,Now may our coming please thee.  In the search
114,CANTO I,Of liberty he journeys: that how dear
115,CANTO I,"They know, who for her sake have life refus'd."
116,CANTO I,"Thou knowest, to whom death for her was sweet"
117,CANTO I,"In Utica, where thou didst leave those weeds,"
118,CANTO I,That in the last great day will shine so bright.
119,CANTO I,For us the' eternal edicts are unmov'd:
120,CANTO I,"He breathes, and I am free of Minos' power,"
121,CANTO I,Abiding in that circle where the eyes
122,CANTO I,"Of thy chaste Marcia beam, who still in look"
123,CANTO I,"Prays thee, O hallow'd spirit! to own her shine."
124,CANTO I,"Then by her love we' implore thee, let us pass"
125,CANTO I,Through thy sev'n regions; for which best thanks
126,CANTO I,"I for thy favour will to her return,"
127,CANTO I,"If mention there below thou not disdain."""
128,CANTO I,
129,CANTO I,"""Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found,"""
130,CANTO I,"He then to him rejoin'd, ""while I was there,"
131,CANTO I,That all she ask'd me I was fain to grant.
132,CANTO I,"Now that beyond the' accursed stream she dwells,"
133,CANTO I,"She may no longer move me, by that law,"
134,CANTO I,"Which was ordain'd me, when I issued thence."
135,CANTO I,"Not so, if Dame from heaven, as thou sayst,"
136,CANTO I,Moves and directs thee; then no flattery needs.
137,CANTO I,Enough for me that in her name thou ask.
138,CANTO I,Go therefore now: and with a slender reed
139,CANTO I,"See that thou duly gird him, and his face"
140,CANTO I,"Lave, till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence."
141,CANTO I,"For not with eye, by any cloud obscur'd,"
142,CANTO I,"Would it be seemly before him to come,"
143,CANTO I,Who stands the foremost minister in heaven.
144,CANTO I,"This islet all around, there far beneath,"
145,CANTO I,"Where the wave beats it, on the oozy bed"
146,CANTO I,"Produces store of reeds. No other plant,"
147,CANTO I,"Cover'd with leaves, or harden'd in its stalk,"
148,CANTO I,"There lives, not bending to the water's sway."
149,CANTO I,"After, this way return not; but the sun"
150,CANTO I,"Will show you, that now rises, where to take"
151,CANTO I,"The mountain in its easiest ascent."""
152,CANTO I,
153,CANTO I,He disappear'd; and I myself uprais'd
154,CANTO I,"Speechless, and to my guide retiring close,"
155,CANTO I,Toward him turn'd mine eyes.  He thus began;
156,CANTO I,"""My son! observant thou my steps pursue."
157,CANTO I,"We must retreat to rearward, for that way"
158,CANTO I,"The champain to its low extreme declines."""
159,CANTO I,
160,CANTO I,"The dawn had chas'd the matin hour of prime,"
161,CANTO I,"Which deaf before it, so that from afar"
162,CANTO I,I spy'd the trembling of the ocean stream.
163,CANTO I,
164,CANTO I,"We travers'd the deserted plain, as one"
165,CANTO I,"Who, wander'd from his track, thinks every step"
166,CANTO I,Trodden in vain till he regain the path.
167,CANTO I,
168,CANTO I,"When we had come, where yet the tender dew"
169,CANTO I,"Strove with the sun, and in a place, where fresh"
170,CANTO I,"The wind breath'd o'er it, while it slowly dried;"
171,CANTO I,Both hands extended on the watery grass
172,CANTO I,"My master plac'd, in graceful act and kind."
173,CANTO I,"Whence I of his intent before appriz'd,"
174,CANTO I,Stretch'd out to him my cheeks suffus'd with tears.
175,CANTO I,There to my visage he anew restor'd
176,CANTO I,"That hue, which the dun shades of hell conceal'd."
177,CANTO I,
178,CANTO I,"Then on the solitary shore arriv'd,"
179,CANTO I,That never sailing on its waters saw
180,CANTO I,"Man, that could after measure back his course,"
181,CANTO I,He girt me in such manner as had pleas'd
182,CANTO I,"Him who instructed, and O, strange to tell!"
183,CANTO I,"As he selected every humble plant,"
184,CANTO I,"Wherever one was pluck'd, another there"
185,CANTO I,"Resembling, straightway in its place arose."
186,CANTO I,
187,CANTO I,
188,CANTO I,
189,CANTO I,
190,CANTO II,CANTO II
191,CANTO II,
192,CANTO II,"Now had the sun to that horizon reach'd,"
193,CANTO II,"That covers, with the most exalted point"
194,CANTO II,"Of its meridian circle, Salem's walls,"
195,CANTO II,"And night, that opposite to him her orb"
196,CANTO II,"Sounds, from the stream of Ganges issued forth,"
197,CANTO II,"Holding the scales, that from her hands are dropp'd"
198,CANTO II,"When she reigns highest: so that where I was,"
199,CANTO II,Aurora's white and vermeil-tinctur'd cheek
200,CANTO II,To orange turn'd as she in age increas'd.
201,CANTO II,
202,CANTO II,"Meanwhile we linger'd by the water's brink,"
203,CANTO II,"Like men, who, musing on their road, in thought"
204,CANTO II,"Journey, while motionless the body rests."
205,CANTO II,"When lo! as near upon the hour of dawn,"
206,CANTO II,Through the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam
207,CANTO II,"Glares down in west, over the ocean floor;"
208,CANTO II,"So seem'd, what once again I hope to view,"
209,CANTO II,"A light so swiftly coming through the sea,"
210,CANTO II,No winged course might equal its career.
211,CANTO II,From which when for a space I had withdrawn
212,CANTO II,"Thine eyes, to make inquiry of my guide,"
213,CANTO II,Again I look'd and saw it grown in size
214,CANTO II,And brightness: thou on either side appear'd
215,CANTO II,"Something, but what I knew not of bright hue,"
216,CANTO II,And by degrees from underneath it came
217,CANTO II,Another.  My preceptor silent yet
218,CANTO II,"Stood, while the brightness, that we first discern'd,"
219,CANTO II,Open'd the form of wings: then when he knew
220,CANTO II,"The pilot, cried aloud, ""Down, down; bend low"
221,CANTO II,Thy knees; behold God's angel: fold thy hands:
222,CANTO II,Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed.
223,CANTO II,
224,CANTO II,"""Lo how all human means he sets at naught!"
225,CANTO II,"So that nor oar he needs, nor other sail"
226,CANTO II,"Except his wings, between such distant shores."
227,CANTO II,"Lo how straight up to heaven he holds them rear'd,"
228,CANTO II,"Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes,"
229,CANTO II,"That not like mortal hairs fall off or change!"""
230,CANTO II,
231,CANTO II,"As more and more toward us came, more bright"
232,CANTO II,"Appear'd the bird of God, nor could the eye"
233,CANTO II,Endure his splendor near: I mine bent down.
234,CANTO II,He drove ashore in a small bark so swift
235,CANTO II,"And light, that in its course no wave it drank."
236,CANTO II,"The heav'nly steersman at the prow was seen,"
237,CANTO II,Visibly written blessed in his looks.
238,CANTO II,
239,CANTO II,Within a hundred spirits and more there sat.
240,CANTO II,"""In Exitu Israel de Aegypto;"""
241,CANTO II,"All with one voice together sang, with what"
242,CANTO II,In the remainder of that hymn is writ.
243,CANTO II,Then soon as with the sign of holy cross
244,CANTO II,"He bless'd them, they at once leap'd out on land,"
245,CANTO II,"The swiftly as he came return'd. The crew,"
246,CANTO II,"There left, appear'd astounded with the place,"
247,CANTO II,Gazing around as one who sees new sights.
248,CANTO II,
249,CANTO II,"From every side the sun darted his beams,"
250,CANTO II,And with his arrowy radiance from mid heav'n
251,CANTO II,"Had chas'd the Capricorn, when that strange tribe"
252,CANTO II,"Lifting their eyes towards us: ""If ye know,"
253,CANTO II,"Declare what path will Lead us to the mount."""
254,CANTO II,
255,CANTO II,"Them Virgil answer'd.  ""Ye suppose perchance"
256,CANTO II,"Us well acquainted with this place: but here,"
257,CANTO II,"We, as yourselves, are strangers.  Not long erst"
258,CANTO II,"We came, before you but a little space,"
259,CANTO II,"By other road so rough and hard, that now"
260,CANTO II,"The' ascent will seem to us as play.""  The spirits,"
261,CANTO II,"Who from my breathing had perceiv'd I liv'd,"
262,CANTO II,Grew pale with wonder.  As the multitude
263,CANTO II,"Flock round a herald, sent with olive branch,"
264,CANTO II,"To hear what news he brings, and in their haste"
265,CANTO II,"Tread one another down, e'en so at sight"
266,CANTO II,"Of me those happy spirits were fix'd, each one"
267,CANTO II,"Forgetful of its errand, to depart,"
268,CANTO II,"Where cleans'd from sin, it might be made all fair."
269,CANTO II,
270,CANTO II,Then one I saw darting before the rest
271,CANTO II,"With such fond ardour to embrace me, I"
272,CANTO II,To do the like was mov'd.  O shadows vain
273,CANTO II,Except in outward semblance! thrice my hands
274,CANTO II,"I clasp'd behind it, they as oft return'd"
275,CANTO II,Empty into my breast again.  Surprise
276,CANTO II,"I needs must think was painted in my looks,"
277,CANTO II,For that the shadow smil'd and backward drew.
278,CANTO II,"To follow it I hasten'd, but with voice"
279,CANTO II,Of sweetness it enjoin'd me to desist.
280,CANTO II,"Then who it was I knew, and pray'd of it,"
281,CANTO II,"To talk with me, it would a little pause."
282,CANTO II,"It answered: ""Thee as in my mortal frame"
283,CANTO II,"I lov'd, so loos'd forth it I love thee still,"
284,CANTO II,"And therefore pause; but why walkest thou here?"""
285,CANTO II,
286,CANTO II,"""Not without purpose once more to return,"
287,CANTO II,"Thou find'st me, my Casella, where I am"
288,CANTO II,"Journeying this way;"" I said, ""but how of thee"
289,CANTO II,"Hath so much time been lost?""  He answer'd straight:"
290,CANTO II,"""No outrage hath been done to me, if he"
291,CANTO II,"Who when and whom he chooses takes, me oft"
292,CANTO II,"This passage hath denied, since of just will"
293,CANTO II,"His will he makes.  These three months past indeed,"
294,CANTO II,"He, whose chose to enter, with free leave"
295,CANTO II,Hath taken; whence I wand'ring by the shore
296,CANTO II,"Where Tyber's wave grows salt, of him gain'd kind"
297,CANTO II,"Admittance, at that river's mouth, tow'rd which"
298,CANTO II,"His wings are pointed, for there always throng"
299,CANTO II,"All such as not to Archeron descend."""
300,CANTO II,
301,CANTO II,"Then I: ""If new laws have not quite destroy'd"
302,CANTO II,"Memory and use of that sweet song of love,"
303,CANTO II,That while all my cares had power to 'swage;
304,CANTO II,Please thee with it a little to console
305,CANTO II,"My spirit, that incumber'd with its frame,"
306,CANTO II,"Travelling so far, of pain is overcome."""
307,CANTO II,
308,CANTO II,"""Love that discourses in my thoughts.""  He then"
309,CANTO II,"Began in such soft accents, that within"
310,CANTO II,The sweetness thrills me yet.  My gentle guide
311,CANTO II,"And all who came with him, so well were pleas'd,"
312,CANTO II,That seem'd naught else might in their thoughts have room.
313,CANTO II,
314,CANTO II,Fast fix'd in mute attention to his notes
315,CANTO II,"We stood, when lo! that old man venerable"
316,CANTO II,"Exclaiming, ""How is this, ye tardy spirits?"
317,CANTO II,What negligence detains you loit'ring here?
318,CANTO II,"Run to the mountain to cast off those scales,"
319,CANTO II,"That from your eyes the sight of God conceal."""
320,CANTO II,
321,CANTO II,"As a wild flock of pigeons, to their food"
322,CANTO II,"Collected, blade or tares, without their pride"
323,CANTO II,"Accustom'd, and in still and quiet sort,"
324,CANTO II,"If aught alarm them, suddenly desert"
325,CANTO II,"Their meal, assail'd by more important care;"
326,CANTO II,"So I that new-come troop beheld, the song"
327,CANTO II,"Deserting, hasten to the mountain's side,"
328,CANTO II,As one who goes yet where he tends knows not.
329,CANTO II,
330,CANTO II,Nor with less hurried step did we depart.
331,CANTO II,
332,CANTO II,
333,CANTO II,
334,CANTO II,
335,CANTO III,CANTO III
336,CANTO III,
337,CANTO III,"Them sudden flight had scatter'd over the plain,"
338,CANTO III,"Turn'd tow'rds the mountain, whither reason's voice"
339,CANTO III,Drives us; I to my faithful company
340,CANTO III,"Adhering, left it not.  For how of him"
341,CANTO III,"Depriv'd, might I have sped, or who beside"
342,CANTO III,Would o'er the mountainous tract have led my steps
343,CANTO III,He with the bitter pang of self-remorse
344,CANTO III,Seem'd smitten.  O clear conscience and upright
345,CANTO III,How doth a little fling wound thee sore!
346,CANTO III,
347,CANTO III,"Soon as his feet desisted (slack'ning pace),"
348,CANTO III,"From haste, that mars all decency of act,"
349,CANTO III,"My mind, that in itself before was wrapt,"
350,CANTO III,"Its thoughts expanded, as with joy restor'd:"
351,CANTO III,And full against the steep ascent I set
352,CANTO III,"My face, where highest to heav'n its top o'erflows."
353,CANTO III,
354,CANTO III,"The sun, that flar'd behind, with ruddy beam"
355,CANTO III,Before my form was broken; for in me
356,CANTO III,His rays resistance met.  I turn'd aside
357,CANTO III,"With fear of being left, when I beheld"
358,CANTO III,Only before myself the ground obscur'd.
359,CANTO III,"When thus my solace, turning him around,"
360,CANTO III,"Bespake me kindly: ""Why distrustest thou?"
361,CANTO III,"Believ'st not I am with thee, thy sure guide?"
362,CANTO III,"It now is evening there, where buried lies"
363,CANTO III,"The body, in which I cast a shade, remov'd"
364,CANTO III,To Naples from Brundusium's wall.  Nor thou
365,CANTO III,"Marvel, if before me no shadow fall,"
366,CANTO III,More than that in the sky element
367,CANTO III,One ray obstructs not other.  To endure
368,CANTO III,"Torments of heat and cold extreme, like frames"
369,CANTO III,"That virtue hath dispos'd, which how it works"
370,CANTO III,Wills not to us should be reveal'd.  Insane
371,CANTO III,"Who hopes, our reason may that space explore,"
372,CANTO III,Which holds three persons in one substance knit.
373,CANTO III,"Seek not the wherefore, race of human kind;"
374,CANTO III,"Could ye have seen the whole, no need had been"
375,CANTO III,For Mary to bring forth.  Moreover ye
376,CANTO III,Have seen such men desiring fruitlessly;
377,CANTO III,"To whose desires repose would have been giv'n,"
378,CANTO III,That now but serve them for eternal grief.
379,CANTO III,"I speak of Plato, and the Stagyrite,"
380,CANTO III,"And others many more.""  And then he bent"
381,CANTO III,"Downwards his forehead, and in troubled mood"
382,CANTO III,Broke off his speech.  Meanwhile we had arriv'd
383,CANTO III,"Far as the mountain's foot, and there the rock"
384,CANTO III,"Found of so steep ascent, that nimblest steps"
385,CANTO III,To climb it had been vain.  The most remote
386,CANTO III,"Most wild untrodden path, in all the tract"
387,CANTO III,'Twixt Lerice and Turbia were to this
388,CANTO III,A ladder easy' and open of access.
389,CANTO III,
390,CANTO III,"""Who knows on which hand now the steep declines?"""
391,CANTO III,"My master said and paus'd, ""so that he may"
392,CANTO III,"Ascend, who journeys without aid of wine?"""
393,CANTO III,And while with looks directed to the ground
394,CANTO III,"The meaning of the pathway he explor'd,"
395,CANTO III,"And I gaz'd upward round the stony height,"
396,CANTO III,"Of spirits, that toward us mov'd their steps,"
397,CANTO III,"Yet moving seem'd not, they so slow approach'd."
398,CANTO III,
399,CANTO III,"I thus my guide address'd: ""Upraise thine eyes,"
400,CANTO III,"Lo that way some, of whom thou may'st obtain"
401,CANTO III,"Counsel, if of thyself thou find'st it not!"""
402,CANTO III,
403,CANTO III,"Straightway he look'd, and with free speech replied:"
404,CANTO III,"""Let us tend thither: they but softly come."
405,CANTO III,"And thou be firm in hope, my son belov'd."""
406,CANTO III,
407,CANTO III,Now was that people distant far in space
408,CANTO III,"A thousand paces behind ours, as much"
409,CANTO III,"As at a throw the nervous arm could fling,"

411,CANTO III,"Of the steep bank, and firmly stood unmov'd"

413,CANTO III,
414,CANTO III,"""O spirits perfect!  O already chosen!"""
415,CANTO III,"Virgil to them began, ""by that blest peace,"
416,CANTO III,"Which, as I deem, is for you all prepar'd,"
417,CANTO III,"Instruct us where the mountain low declines,"

426,CANTO III,"Simple and quiet, nor the cause discern;"
427,CANTO III,"So saw I moving to advance the first,"
428,CANTO III,"Who of that fortunate crew were at the head,"
429,CANTO III,Of modest mien and graceful in their gait.
430,CANTO III,When they before me had beheld the light
431,CANTO III,"From my right side fall broken on the ground,"
432,CANTO III,"So that the shadow reach'd the cave, they stopp'd"
433,CANTO III,"And somewhat back retir'd: the same did all,"
434,CANTO III,"Who follow'd, though unweeting of the cause."
435,CANTO III,
436,CANTO III,"""Unask'd of you, yet freely I confess,"
437,CANTO III,This is a human body which ye see.

439,CANTO III,"Marvel not: but believe, that not without"
440,CANTO III,"Virtue deriv'd from Heaven, we to climb"
441,CANTO III,"Over this wall aspire.""  So them bespake"
442,CANTO III,My master; and that virtuous tribe rejoin'd;

444,CANTO III,Making a signal to us with bent hands.

449,CANTO III,
450,CANTO III,"I tow'rds him turn'd, and with fix'd eye beheld."
451,CANTO III,"Comely, and fair, and gentle of aspect,"
452,CANTO III,"He seem'd, but on one brow a gash was mark'd."
453,CANTO III,
454,CANTO III,When humbly I disclaim'd to have beheld
455,CANTO III,"Him ever: ""Now behold!""  he said, and show'd"
456,CANTO III,High on his breast a wound: then smiling spake.

464,CANTO III,"My frame was shatter'd, I betook myself"
465,CANTO III,"Weeping to him, who of free will forgives."
466,CANTO III,My sins were horrible; but so wide arms

472,CANTO III,"Near Benevento, by the heavy mole"
473,CANTO III,"Protected; but the rain now drenches them,"
474,CANTO III,"And the wind drives, out of the kingdom's bounds,"
475,CANTO III,"Far as the stream of Verde, where, with lights"
476,CANTO III,"Extinguish'd, he remov'd them from their bed."
477,CANTO III,"Yet by their curse we are not so destroy'd,"

480,CANTO III,That such one as in contumacy dies
481,CANTO III,"Against the holy church, though he repent,"
482,CANTO III,Must wander thirty-fold for all the time
