42,I.,
43,I.,"Real and Ideal--these are the handy terms, admiring or disapproving,"
44,I.,which criticism claps with random facility on to every imaginable
45,I.,school. This artist or group of artists goes in for the real--the
46,I.,"upright, noble, trumpery, filthy real; that other artist or group of"
47,I.,artists seeks after the ideal--the ideal which may mean sublimity or
48,I.,platitude. We summon every living artist to state whether he is a
49,I.,realist or an idealist; we classify all dead artists as realists or
50,I.,idealists; we treat the matter as if it were one of almost moral
51,I.,importance. Now the fact of the case is that the question of realism and
52,I.,"idealism, which we calmly assume as already settled or easy to settle by"
53,I.,"our own sense of right and wrong, is one of the tangled questions of"
54,I.,"art-philosophy; and one, moreover, which no amount of theory, but only"
55,I.,"historic fact, can ever set right. For, to begin with, we find realism"
56,I.,and idealism coming before us in different ways and with different
57,I.,meaning and importance. All art which is not addressing (as decrepit art
58,I.,is forced to do) faculties to which it does not spontaneously and
59,I.,"properly appeal--all art is decorative, ornamental, idealistic"
60,I.,"therefore, since it consciously or unconsciously aims, not merely at"
61,I.,"reproducing the already existing, but at producing something which shall"
62,I.,"repay the looking at it, something which shall ornament, if not a place,"
63,I.,"at least our lives; and such making of the ornamental, of the worth"
64,I.,"looking at, necessarily implies selection and arrangement--that is to"
65,I.,"say idealism. At the same time, while art aims definitely at being in"
66,I.,"this sense decorative, art may very possibly aim more immediately at"
67,I.,"merely reproducing, without, selection or arrangement, the actually"
68,I.,existing things of the world; and this in order to obtain the mere power
69,I.,"of representation. In short, art which is idealistic as a master will"
70,I.,"yet be realistic as a scholar: it decorates when it achieves, it copies"
71,I.,when it studies. But this is only half the question. Certain whole
72,I.,"schools may be described as idealistic, others as realistic, in"
73,I.,"tendency; and this, not in their study, but in their achievement. One"
74,I.,school will obviously be contented with forms the most unselected and
75,I.,vulgar; others will go but little out of their way in search of
76,I.,"form-superiority; while yet others, and these we must emphatically call"
77,I.,"idealistic, are squeamish to the last degree in the choice and"
78,I.,"adaptation of form, anxious, to get the very best, and make the very"
79,I.,"best of it. Yet, on thinking over it, we shall find that realistic and"
80,I.,"idealistic schools are all, in their achievements, equally striving"
81,I.,after something which is not the mere reproduction of the already
82,I.,"existing as such--striving, in short, after decoration. The pupil of"
83,I.,"Perugino will, indeed, wait patiently to begin his work until he can"
84,I.,find a model fit for a god or goddess; while the fellow-craftsman of
85,I.,Rembrandt will be satisfied with the first dirty old Jew or besotten
86,I.,"barmaid that comes to hand. But the realistic Dutchman is not,"
87,I.,"therefore, any the less smitten with beauty, any the less eager to be"
88,I.,"ornamental, than the idealistic Italian: his man and woman he takes"
89,I.,"indeed with off-hand indifference, but he places them in that of which"
90,I.,"the Italian shall perhaps never have dreamed, in that on which he has"
91,I.,"expended all his science, his skill, his fancy, in that which he gives"
92,I.,"as his addition to the beautiful things of art--in atmosphere, in light,"
93,I.,which are to the everyday atmosphere and light what the patiently sought
94,I.,"for, carefully perfected god or goddess model of Raphael is to the"
95,I.,"everyday Jew, to the everyday barmaid, of Rembrandt."
96,I.,
97,I.,"The ideal, for the man who is quite coarsely realistic in his figures,"
98,I.,"exists in the air, light, colour; and in saying this I have, so to"
99,I.,"speak, turned over the page too quickly, forestalled the expression of"
100,I.,what I can prove only later: the disconnection of such comparative
101,I.,"realism and idealism as this (the only kind of realism, let us remember,"
102,I.,"which can exist in great art) with any personal bias of the artist, its"
103,I.,"intimate dependence upon the constitution and tendency of art, upon its"
104,I.,"preoccupations about form, or colour, or light, in a given country and"
105,I.,at a given moment. And now I should wish to resume the more orderly
106,I.,"treatment of the subject, which will lead us in time to the second half"
107,I.,of the question respecting realism and idealism. These considerations
108,I.,have come to me in connection with the portrait art of the Renaissance;
109,I.,"and this very simply. For portrait is a curious bastard of art, sprung"
110,I.,"on the one side from a desire which is not artistic, nay, if anything,"
111,I.,opposed to the whole nature and function of art: the desire for the mere
112,I.,"likeness of an individual. The union with this interloping tendency, so"
113,I.,"foreign to the whole aristocratic temper of art, has produced portrait;"
114,I.,"and by the position of this hybrid, or at least far from regularly bred"
115,I.,creature; by the amount of the real artistic quality of beauty which it
116,I.,"is permitted to retain by the various schools of art, we can, even as by"
117,I.,the treatment of similar social interlopers we can estimate the
118,I.,"necessities and tendencies of various states of society, judge what are"
119,I.,the conditions in which the various schools of art struggle for the
120,I.,"object of their lives, which is the beautiful."
121,I.,
122,I.,I have said that art is realistic in its periods or moments of study;
123,I.,and this is essentially the case even with the school which in many
124,I.,respects was the most unmistakably decorative and idealistic in
125,I.,intention: the school of Giotto. The Giottesques are more than
126,I.,"decorative artists, they are decorators in the most literal sense."
127,I.,Painting with them is merely one of the several arts and crafts enslaved
128,I.,by mediæval architecture and subservient to architectural effects. Their
129,I.,art is the only one which is really and successfully architecturally
130,I.,decorative; and to appreciate this we must contrast their fresco-work
131,I.,"with that of the fifteenth century and all subsequent times. Masaccio,"
132,I.,"Ghirlandajo, Signorelli, turn the wall into a mere badly made frame; a"
133,I.,"gigantic piece of cardboard would do as well, and better; the colours"
134,I.,"melt into one another, the figures detach themselves at various degrees"
135,I.,of relief; those upon the ceiling and pendentives are frequently upside
136,I.,"down; yet these figures, which are so difficult to see, are worth seeing"
137,I.,"only in themselves, and not in relation to their position. The masonry"
138,I.,"is no longer covered, but carved, rendered uneven with the cavities and"
139,I.,protrusions of perspective. In Mantegna's frescoes the wall becomes a
140,I.,"slanting theatre scene, cunningly perspectived like Palladio's Teatro"
141,I.,"Olimpico; with Correggio, wall, masonry, everything, is dissolved, the"
142,I.,"side or cupola of a church becomes a rent in the clouds, streaming with"
143,I.,light.
144,I.,
145,I.,"Not so with the Giottesque frescoes: the wall, the vault, the triumphant"
146,I.,"masonry is always present and felt, beneath the straight, flat bands of"
147,I.,"uniform colour; the symmetrical compartments, the pentacles, triangles,"
148,I.,"and segments, and borders of histories, whose figures never project,"
149,I.,whose colours are separate as those in a mosaic. The Giottesque
150,I.,"frescoes, with their tiers and compartments of dark blue, their vague"
151,I.,"figures dressed in simple ultramarines, greens, dull reds, and purples;"
152,I.,"their geometrical borders and pearlings and dog-tooths; cover the walls,"
153,I.,"the ribbed and arched ceilings, the pointed raftering almost like some"
154,I.,"beautiful brown, blue, and tarnished gold leather-hangings; the figures,"
155,I.,"outlined in dark paint, have almost the appearance of being stencilled,"
156,I.,or even stamped on the wall. Such is Giottesque painting: an art which
157,I.,"is not merely essentially decorative, but which is, moreover, what"
158,I.,"painting and sculpture remained throughout the Gothic period,"
159,I.,subservient to the decorative effect of another art; an art in which all
160,I.,"is subordinated to architectural effect, in which form, colour, figures,"
161,I.,"houses, the most dramatic scenes of the most awful of all dramas,"
162,I.,everything is turned into a kind of colossal and sublime wall-paper; and
163,I.,"such an art as this would lead us to expect but little realism, little"
164,I.,deliberate and slavish imitation of the existing. Yet wherever there is
165,I.,"life in this Gothic art (which has a horrible tendency, piously"
166,I.,"unobserved by critics, to stagnate into blundering repetition of the"
167,I.,"same thing), wherever there is progress, there is, in the details of"
168,I.,"that grandiose, idealistic decoration, realism of the crudest kind."
169,I.,"Those Giottesque workers, who were not content with a kind of Gothic"
170,I.,Byzantinism; those who really handed over something vital to their
171,I.,"successors of the fifteenth century, while repeating the old"
172,I.,idealistical decorations; were studying with extraordinary crudeness of
173,I.,realism. Everything that was not conventional ornament or type was
174,I.,portrait; and portrait in which the scanty technical means of the
175,I.,"artist, every meagre line and thin dab of colour, every timid stroke of"
176,I.,"brush or of pencil, went towards the merciless delineation not merely of"
177,I.,"a body but of a soul. And the greater the artist, the more cruel the"
178,I.,portrait: cruellest in representation of utter spiritual baseness in the
179,I.,"two greatest of these idealistic decorators; Giotto, and his latest"
180,I.,"disciple, Fra Angelico. Of this I should like to give a couple of"
181,I.,examples.
182,I.,
183,I.,In Giotto's frescoes at Santa Croce--one of the most lovely pieces of
184,I.,mere architectural decoration conceivable--there are around the dying
185,I.,"and the dead St. Francis two groups of monks, which are astoundingly"
186,I.,realistic. The solemn ending of the ideally beautiful life of sanctity
187,I.,"which was so fresh in the memory of Giotto's contemporaries, is nothing"
188,I.,"beyond a set of portraits of the most absolutely mediocre creatures,"
189,I.,"moral and intellectual, of creatures the most utterly incapable of"
190,I.,religious enthusiasm that ever made religion a livelihood. They gather
191,I.,"round the dying and the dead St. Francis, a noble figure, not at all"
192,I.,"ecstatic or seraphic, but pure, strong, worn out with wise and righteous"
193,I.,"labour, a man of thought and action, upon whose hands and feet the"
194,I.,stigmata of supernatural rapture are a mere absurdity. The monks are
195,I.,"presumably his immediate disciples, those fervent and delicate poetic"
196,I.,"natures of whom we read in the ""Fioretti di San Francesco."" To represent"
197,I.,them Giotto has painted the likeness of the first half-dozen friars he
198,I.,"may have met in the streets near Santa Croce: not caricatures, nor"
199,I.,"ideals, but portraits Giotto has attempted neither to exalt nor to"
200,I.,degrade them into any sort of bodily or spiritual interestingness. They
201,I.,are not low nor bestial nor extremely stupid. They are in various
202,I.,"degrees dull, sly, routinist, prosaic, pedantic; their most noteworthy"
203,I.,characteristic is that they are certainly the men who are not called by
204,I.,"God. They are no scandal to the Church, but no honour; they are sloth,"
205,I.,"stupidity, sensualism, and cunning not yet risen to the dignity of a"
206,I.,"vice. They look upon the dying and the dead saint with indifference,"
207,I.,"want of understanding, at most a gape or a bright look of stupid"
208,I.,miscomprehension at the stigmata: they do not even perceive that a saint
209,I.,is a different being from themselves. With these frescoes of Giotto I
210,I.,should wish to compare Fra Angelico's great ceremonial crucifixion in
211,I.,the cloister chapel of San Marco of Florence; for it displays to an
212,I.,extraordinary degree that juxtaposition of the most conventionally
213,I.,"idealistic, pious decorativeness with the realism straightforward,"
214,I.,"unreflecting, and heartless to the point of becoming perfectly"
215,I.,grotesque. The fresco is divided into two scenes: on the one side the
216,I.,"crucifixion, the mystic actors of the drama, on the other the holy men"
217,I.,admitted to its contemplation. A sense that holy things ought to be
218,I.,"old-fashioned, a respect for Byzantine inanity which invariable haunted"
219,I.,"the Giottesques in their capacity of idealistic decorators, of men who"
220,I.,replaced with frescoes the solemn lifeless splendours of mosaic; this
221,I.,"kind of artistico-religious prudery has made Angelico, who was able to"
222,I.,"foreshorten powerfully the brawny crucified thieves, represent the"
223,I.,"Saviour dangling from the cross bleached, boneless, and shapeless, a"
224,I.,thing that is not dead because it has never been alive. The holy persons
225,I.,"around stand rigid, vacant, against their blue nowhere of background,"
226,I.,with vague expanses of pink face looking neither one way nor the other;
227,I.,"mere modernized copies of the strange, goggle-eyed, vapid beings on the"
228,I.,old Italian mosaics. This is not a representation of the actual reality
229,I.,"of the crucifixion, like Tintoret's superb picture at S. Rocco, or"
230,I.,"Dürer's print, or so many others, which show the hill, the people, the"
231,I.,"hangman, the ladders and ropes and hammers and tweezers: it is a sort of"
232,I.,"mystic repetition of it; subjective, if I may say so; existing only in"
233,I.,"the contemplation of the saints on the opposite side, who are spectators"
234,I.,only in the sense that a contemplative Christian may be said to be the
235,I.,mystic spectator of the Passion. The thing for the painter to represent
236,I.,"is fervent contemplation, ecstatic realization of the past by the force"
237,I.,"of ardent love and belief; the condition of mind of St. Francis, St."
238,I.,"Catherine of Siena, Madame Guyon: it is the revelation of the great"
239,I.,"tragedy of heaven to the soul of the mystic. Now, how does Fra Angelico"
240,I.,"represent this? A row of saints, founders of orders, kneel one behind"
241,I.,"the other, and by their side stand apostles and doctors of the Church;"
242,I.,"admitting them to the sight of the super-human, with the gesture, the"
243,I.,"bland, indifferent vacuity of the Cameriere Segreto or Monsignore who"
244,I.,"introduces a troop of pilgrims to the Pope; they are privileged persons,"
245,I.,"they respect, they keep up decorum, they raise their eyes and compress"
246,I.,"their lips with ceremonious reverence; but, Lord! they have gone through"
247,I.,"it all so often, they are so familiar with it, they don't look at it any"
248,I.,"longer; they gaze about listlessly, they would yawn if they were not too"
249,I.,"well bred for that. The others, meanwhile, the sainted pilgrims, the men"
250,I.,whose journey over the sharp stones and among the pricking brambles of
251,I.,life's wilderness finds its final reward in this admission into the
252,I.,"presence of the Holiest, kneel one by one, with various expressions: one"
253,I.,with the stupid delight of a religious sightseer; his vanity is
254,I.,"satisfied, he will next draw a rosary from his pocket and get it blessed"
255,I.,by Christ Himself; he will recount it all to his friends at home.
256,I.,"Another is dull and gaping, a clown who has walked barefoot from"
257,I.,"Valencia to Rome, and got imbecile by the way; yet another, prim and"
258,I.,"dapper; the rest indifferent looking restlessly about them, at each"
259,I.,"other, at their feet and hands, perhaps exchanging mute remarks about"
260,I.,the length of time they are kept waiting; those at the end of the
261,I.,"kneeling procession, St. Peter Martyr and St. Giovanni Gualberto"
262,I.,"especially, have the bored, listless, devout look of the priestlets in"
263,I.,"the train of a bishop. All these figures, the standing ones who"
264,I.,"introduce and the kneeling ones who are being introduced, are the most"
265,I.,"perfect types of various states of dull, commonplace, mediocre routinist"
266,I.,"superstition; so many Camerlenghi on the one hand, so many Passionist or"
267,I.,"Propagandists on the other: the first aristocratic, bland and bored; the"
268,I.,"second, dull, listless, mumbling, chewing Latin Prayers which never"
269,I.,"meant much to their minds, and now mean nothing; both perfectly"
270,I.,"reverential and proper in behaviour, with no more possibility of"
271,I.,individual fervour of belief than of individual levity of disbelief: the
272,I.,"Church, as it exists in well-regulated decrepitude. And thus does the"
273,I.,"last of the Giottesques, the painter of glorified Madonnas and dancing"
274,I.,"angels, the saint, represent the saints admitted to behold the supreme"
275,I.,tragedy of the Redemption.
276,I.,
277,I.,Thus much for the Giottesques. The Tuscans of the early Renaissance
278,I.,"developed up to the utmost, assisted by the goldsmiths and sculptors,"
279,I.,"who taught them modelling and anatomy, that realistic element of"
280,I.,Giottesque painting. Its ideal decorative part had become impossible.
281,I.,"Painting could no longer be a decoration of architecture, and it had not"
282,I.,yet the means of being ornamental in itself; it was an art which did
283,I.,"not achieve, but merely studied. Among its exercises in anatomy,"
284,I.,"modelling, perspective, and so forth, always laborious and frequently"
285,I.,"abortive, its only spontaneous, satisfactory, mature production was its"
286,I.,"portrait work, Portraits of burghers in black robes and hoods; of"
287,I.,"square-jawed youths with red caps stuck on to their fuzzy heads, of bald"
288,I.,and wrinkled scholars and magnificoes; of thinly bearded artizans;
289,I.,"people who stand round the preaching Baptist or crucified Saviour, look"
290,I.,"on at miracle or martyrdom, stolid, self-complacent, heedless, against"
291,I.,"their background of towered, walled, and cypressed city--of buttressed"
292,I.,"square and street; ugly but real, interesting, powerful among the"
293,I.,"grotesque agglomerations of bag-of-bones nudities, bunched and taped-up"
294,I.,draperies and out-of-joint architecture of the early Renaissance
295,I.,frescoes; at best among its picture-book and Noah's-ark prettinesses of
296,I.,"toy-box cypresses, vine trellises, inlaid house fronts, rabbits in the"
297,I.,"grass, and peacocks on the roofs; for the early Renaissance, with the"
298,I.,"one exception of Masaccio, is in reality a childish time of art, giving"
299,I.,us the horrors of school-hour blunders and abortions varied with the
300,I.,"delights of nursery wonderland: maturity, the power of achieving, the"
301,I.,"perception of something worthy of perception, comes only with the later"
302,I.,"generation, the one immediately preceding the age of Raphael and Michael"
303,I.,"Angelo; with Ghirlandajo, Signorelli, Filippino, Botticelli, Perugino,"
304,I.,and their contemporaries.
305,I.,
306,I.,"But this period is not childish, is not immature in everything. Or,"
307,I.,"rather, the various arts which exist together at this period are not all"
308,I.,in the same stage of development. While painting is in this immature
309,I.,"ugliness, and ideal sculpture, in works like Verrocchio's and"
310,I.,"Donatello's David, only a cleverer, more experienced, but less"
311,I.,"legitimate kind of painting, painting more successful in the present,"
312,I.,but with no possible future; the almost separate art of
313,I.,portrait-sculpture arises again where it was left by Græco-Roman
314,I.,"masters, and, developing to yet greater perfection, gives in marble the"
315,I.,equivalent of what painting will be able to produce only much later:
316,I.,realistic art which is decorative; beautiful works made out of ugly
317,I.,materials.
318,I.,
319,I.,"The vicissitudes of Renaissance sculpture are strange: its life, its"
320,I.,"power, depend upon death; it is an art developed in the burying vault"
321,I.,and cloister cemetery. During the Middle Ages sculpture had had its
322,I.,"reason, its vital possibility, its something to influence, nay, to keep"
323,I.,"it alive, in architecture; but with the disappearance of Gothic building"
324,I.,disappears also the possibility of the sculpture which covers the
325,I.,portals of Chartres and the belfry of Florence. The pseudo-classic
326,I.,"colonnades, entablatures, all the thin bastard Ionic and Corinthian of"
327,I.,"Aberti and Bramante, did not require sculpture, or had their own little"
328,I.,"supply of unfleshed ox-skulls, greengrocer's garlands, scallopings and"
329,I.,"wave-linings, which, with a stray siren and one or two bloated emperors'"
330,I.,"heads, amply sufficed. On the other hand, mediæval civilization and"
331,I.,Christian dogma did not encourage the production of naked of draped
332,I.,ideal statues like those which Antiquity stuck on countless temple
333,I.,"fronts, and erected at every corner of square, street, or garden. The"
334,I.,"people of the Middle Ages were too grievously ill grown, distorted,"
335,I.,"hideous, to be otherwise than indecent in nudity; they may have had an"
336,I.,"instinct of the kind, and, ugly as they knew themselves to be, they must"
337,I.,yet have found in forms like those of Verrocchio's David insufficient
338,I.,"beauty to give much pleasure. Besides, if the Middle Ages had left no"
339,I.,moral room for ideal sculpture once freed from the service of
340,I.,architecture; they had still less provided it with a physical place.
341,I.,"Such things could not be set up in churches, and only a very moderate"
342,I.,number of statues could be wanted as open-air monuments in the narrow
343,I.,"space of a still Gothic city; and, in fact, ideal heroic statues of the"
344,I.,"early Renaissance are fortunately not only ugly, but comparatively few"
345,I.,"in number. There remained, therefore, for sculpture, unless contented to"
346,I.,"dwindle down into brass and gold miniature work, no regular employment"
347,I.,save that connected with sepulchral monuments. During the real Middle
348,I.,"Ages, and in the still Gothic north, the ornamentation of a tomb"
349,I.,"belonged to architecture: from the superb miniature minsters, pillared"
350,I.,"and pinnacled and sculptured, cathedrals within the cathedral, to the"
351,I.,"humbler foliated arched canopy, protecting a simple sarcophagus at the"
352,I.,corner of many a street in Lombardy. The sculptor's work was but the
353,I.,"low relief on the church flags, the timidly carved, outlined,"
354,I.,"cross-legged knight or praying priest, flattened down on his pillow as"
355,I.,"if ashamed even of that amount of prominence, and in a hurry to be"
356,I.,trodden down and obliterated into a few ghostly outlines. But to this
357,I.,"humiliated prostrate image, to this flat thing doomed to obliteration,"
358,I.,"came the sculptor of the Renaissance, and bade the wafer-like simulacrum"
359,I.,"fill up, expand, raise itself, lift itself on its elbow, arise and take"
360,I.,"possession of the bed of state, the catafalque raised high above the"
361,I.,"crowd, draped with brocade, carved with rich devices of leaves and"
362,I.,"beasts of heraldry, roofed over with a daïs, which is almost a triumphal"
363,I.,"arch, garlanded with fruits and flowers, upon which the illustrious dead"
364,I.,"were shown to the people; but made eternal, and of eternal magnificence,"
365,I.,"by the stone-cutter, and guarded, not for an hour by the liveried pages"
366,I.,"or chaunting monks, but by winged genii for all eternity. Some people, I"
367,I.,"know, call this a degradation, and say that it was the result of corrupt"
368,I.,"pride, this refusal to have the dear or illustrious dead scraped out any"
369,I.,"longer by the shoe-nails of every ruffian, rubbed out by the knees of"
370,I.,every kitchen wench; but to me it seems that it was due merely to the
371,I.,"fact that sculpture had lost its former employment, and that a great art"
372,I.,cannot (thank Heaven!) be pietistically self-humiliating. Be this as it
373,I.,"may, the sculpture of the Renaissance had found a new and singularly"
374,I.,"noble line of work, the one in which it was great, unique, unsurpassed,"
375,I.,"because untutored. It worked here without models, to suit modern"
376,I.,"requirements, with modern spirit; it was emphatically-modern sculpture;"
377,I.,"the only modern sculpture which can be talked of as something original,"
378,I.,"genuine, valuable, by the side of antique sculpture. Greek Antiquity had"
379,I.,"evaded death, and neglected the dead; a garland of mænads and fauns"
380,I.,"among ivy leaves, a battle of amazons or centaurs; in the late"
381,I.,"semi-Christian, platonic days, some Orphic emblem, or genius; at most,"
382,I.,"as in the exquisite tombs of the Keramikos of Athens, a figure, a youth"
383,I.,"on a prancing steed, like the Phidian monument of Dexileus; a maiden,"
384,I.,draped and bearing an urn; but neither the youth nor the maiden is the
385,I.,"inmate of the tomb: they are types, living types, no portraits. Nay,"
386,I.,"even where Antiquity shows us Death or Hermes, gently leading away the"
387,I.,"beloved; the spirit, the ghost, the dead one, is unindividual."
388,I.,"""Sarkophagen und Urnen bekränzte der Heide mit Leben,"" said Goethe; but"
389,I.,it was the life which was everlasting because it was typical: the life
390,I.,"not which had been relinquished by the one buried there, but the life"
391,I.,"which the world danced on, forgetful, round his ashes. The Romans, on"
392,I.,"the contrary, graver and more retentive folk than the Greeks, as well as"
393,I.,"more domestic, less coffee-house living, appear to have inherited from"
394,I.,"the Etruscans a desire to preserve the effigy of the dead, a desire"
395,I.,"unknown to the Greeks. But the Etrusco-Roman monuments, where husband"
396,I.,"and wife stare forth togaed and stolaed, half reduced to a conventional"
397,I.,"crop-headedness, grim and stiff as if sitting unwillingly for their"
398,I.,"portrait; or reclining on the sarcophagus-lid, neither dead, nor asleep,"
399,I.,"nor yet alive and awake, but with a hieratic mummy stare, have little of"
400,I.,"æsthetic or sympathetic value. The early Renaissance, then, first"
401,I.,bethought it of representing the real individual in the real death
402,I.,slumber. And I question whether anything more fitting could be placed on
403,I.,a tomb than the effigy of the dead as we saw them just before the
404,I.,coffin-lid closed down; as we would give our all to see them but one
405,I.,little moment longer; as they continue to exist for our fancy within the
406,I.,grave; for to any but morbid feelings the beloved can never suffer
407,I.,"decay. Whereas a portrait of the man in life, as the throning popes in"
408,I.,"St. Peter's, seems heartless and derisive; such monuments striking us as"
409,I.,"conceived and ordered by their inmates while alive, like Michael"
410,I.,"Angelo's Pope Julius, and Browning's Bishop, who was so preoccupied"
411,I.,"about his tomb in St. Praxed's Church. The Renaissance, the late Middle"
412,I.,"Ages, felt better than this: on the extreme pinnacle, high on the roof,"
413,I.,"they might indeed place against the russet brick or the blue sky, amid"
414,I.,"the hum of life and the movement of the air, the living man, like the"
415,I.,"Scaligers, the mailed knight on his charger, lance in rest: but in the"
416,I.,"church below, under the funereal pall, they could place only the body"
417,I.,such as it may have lain on the bier.
418,I.,
419,I.,And that figure on the bier was the great work of Renaissance sculpture.
420,I.,Inanimate and vulgar when in heroic figures they tried to emulate the
421,I.,"ancients, the sculptors of the fifteenth century have found their own"
422,I.,"line. The modesty, the simplicity, the awful and beautiful repose of the"
423,I.,dead; the individual character cleared of all its conflicting meannesses
424,I.,"by death, simplified, idealized as it is in the memory of the"
425,I.,survivors--all these are things which belong to the Renaissance. As the
426,I.,"Greeks gave the strong, smooth life-current circulating through their"
427,I.,heroes; so did these men of the fifteenth century give the gentle and
428,I.,harmonious ebbing after-life of death in their sepulchral monuments.
429,I.,"Things difficult to describe, and which must be seen and remembered."
430,I.,"There is the monument, now in the museum at Ravenna, by a sculptor whose"
431,I.,"name, were it known, would surely be among the greatest, of the"
432,I.,"condottiere, Braccioforte: the body prone in its heavy case of armour,"
433,I.,"not yet laid out in state, but such as he may have been found in the"
434,I.,"evening, when the battle was over, under a tree where they had carried"
435,I.,him to die while they themselves went back to fight; the head has fallen
436,I.,"back, side-ways, weighed down by the helmet, which has not even been"
437,I.,"unbuckled, only the face, the clear-cut, austere features, visible"
438,I.,beneath the withdrawn vizor; the eyes have not been closed; and there
439,I.,"are few things more exquisite and solemn at once in all sculpture, than"
440,I.,"the indication of those no longer seeing eyes, of that broken glance,"
441,I.,beneath the half-closed lids. There is Rossellino's Cardinal of Portugal
442,I.,"at S. Miniato a Monte: the slight body, draped in episcopal robes, lying"
443,I.,"with delicate folded hands, in gracious decorum of youthful sanctity;"
444,I.,"the strong delicate head, of clear feature and gentle furrow of"
445,I.,"suffering and thought, a face of infinite purity of strength, strength"
446,I.,"still ungnarled by action: a young priest, who in his virginal dignity"
447,I.,is almost a noble woman. And there is the Ilaria Guinigi of Jacopo della
448,I.,Quercia (the man who had most natural affinity with the antique of all
449,I.,"these sculptors, as one may see from the shattered remains of the Fonte"
450,I.,"Gaia of Siena), the lady stretched out on the rose-garlanded bed of"
451,I.,"state in a corner of Lucca Cathedral, her feet upon her sleeping dog,"
452,I.,"her sweet, girlish head, with wavy plaits of hair encircled by a"
453,I.,"rose-wreathed, turban-like diadem, lying low on round cushions; the bed"
454,I.,"gently giving way beneath the beautiful, ample-bosomed body, round which"
455,I.,"the soft robe is chastely gathered, and across which the long-sleeved"
456,I.,arms are demurely folded; the most beautiful lady (whose majestic tread
457,I.,through the palace rooms we can well imagine) that the art of the
458,I.,"fifteenth century has recorded. There is, above all, the Carlo"
459,I.,"Marsuppini of Desiderio da Settignano, the humanist Secretary of the"
460,I.,"Commonwealth, lying on the sarcophagus, superb with shell fretwork and"
461,I.,"curling acanthus, in Santa Croce of Florence. For the youthful beauty"
462,I.,of the Cardinal of Portugal and of the Lady Ilaria are commonplace
463,I.,"compared with the refinement of this worn old face, with scant wavy hair"
464,I.,"and thin, gently furrowed, but by no means ploughed-up features. The"
465,I.,slight figure looks as if in life it must have seemed almost
466,I.,"transparent; and the hands are very pathetic: noble, firm hands, subtle"
467,I.,"of vein and wrist, crossed simply, neither in prayer nor in agony, but"
468,I.,"in gentle weariness, over the book on his breast. That book is certainly"
469,I.,no prayer-book; rather a volume of Plato or Cicero: in his last moments
470,I.,the noble old man has longed for a glance over the familiar pages; they
471,I.,"have placed the book on his breast, but it has been too late; the"
472,I.,"drowsiness of death has overtaken him, and with his last sigh he has"
473,I.,"gently folded his hands over the volume, with the faint, last clinging"
474,I.,to the things beloved in this world.
475,I.,
476,I.,"Such is that portrait sculpture of the early Renaissance, its only"
477,I.,"sculpture, if we except the exquisite work in babies and angels just out"
478,I.,"of the nursery of the Robbias, which is a real achievement. But how"
479,I.,achieved? This art is great just by the things which Antiquity did not.
480,I.,And what are those things? Shall we say that it is sentiment? But all
481,I.,"fine art has tact, antique art most certainly; and as to pathos, why,"
482,I.,"any quiet figure of a dead man or woman, however rudely carved, has"
483,I.,"pathos; nay, there is pathos in the poor puling hysterical art which"
484,I.,"makes angels draw the curtains of fine ladies' bedchambers, and fine"
485,I.,"ladies, in hoop or limp Grecian dress, faint (the smelling bottle,"
486,I.,"Betty!) over their lord's coffin; there is pathos, to a decently"
487,I.,"constituted human being, wherever (despite all absurdities) we can"
488,I.,"imagine that there lies some one whom it was bitter to see departing, to"
489,I.,"whom it was bitter to depart. Pathos, therefore, is not the question;"
490,I.,"and, if you choose to call it sentiment, it is in reality a sentiment"
491,I.,"for line and curve, for stone and light. The great question is, How did"
492,I.,these men of the Renaissance make their dead people look beautiful? For
493,I.,"they were not all beautiful in life, and ugly folk do not grow beautiful"
494,I.,"merely because they are dead. The Cardinal of Portugal, the beautiful"
495,I.,"Ilaria herself, were you to sketch their profile and place it by the"
496,I.,"side of no matter what ordinary antique, would greatly fall short of"
497,I.,"what we call sculpturesque beauty; and many of the others, old humanists"
498,I.,"and priests and lawyers, are emphatically ugly: snub or absurdly hooked"
499,I.,"noses, retreating or deformedly overhanging foreheads, fleshy noses, and"
500,I.,"flabby cheeks, blear eyes and sunk-in mouths; and a perfect network of"
501,I.,"wrinkles and creases, which, hard as it is to say, have been scooped out"
502,I.,"not merely by age, but by low mind, fretting and triumphant animalism."
503,I.,"Now, by what means did the sculptor--the sculptor, too unacquainted with"
504,I.,"sculptural beauty (witness his ugly ideal statues), to be able, like the"
505,I.,man who turned the successors of Alexander into a race of leonine though
506,I.,crazy demi-gods--to insidiously idealize these ugly and insignificant
507,I.,features; by what means did he turn these dead men into things beautiful
508,I.,to see? I have said that he took up art where Græco-Roman Antiquity had
509,I.,"left it. Remark that I say Græco-Roman, and I ought to add much more"
510,I.,"Roman than Greek. For Greek sculpture, nurtured in the habit of perfect"
511,I.,"form, art to whom beauty was a cheap necessity, invariably idealized"
512,I.,"portrait, idealized it into beauty or inanity. But when Greek art had"
513,I.,run its course; when beauty of form had well-nigh been exhausted or
514,I.,"begun to pall; certain artists, presumably Greeks, but working for"
515,I.,"Romans, began to produce portrait work of quite a new and wonderful"
516,I.,"sort: the beautiful portraits of ugly old men, of snub little boys, work"
517,I.,"which was clearly before its right time, and was swamped by idealized"
518,I.,"portraits, insipid, nay, inane, from the elegant revivalist busts of"
519,I.,Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius down to the bonnet blocks of the lower
520,I.,"empire. Of this Roman portrait art, of certain heads of half-idiotic"
521,I.,"little Cæsar brats, of sly and wrinkled old men, things which ought to"
522,I.,"be so ugly and yet are so beautiful, we say, at least, perhaps"
523,I.,"unformulated, we think, ""How Renaissance!"" And the secret of the beauty"
524,I.,"of these few Græco-Roman busts, which is also that of Renaissance"
525,I.,"portrait sculpture, is that the beauty is quite different in kind from"
526,I.,"the beauty of Greek ideal sculpture, and obtained by quite different"
527,I.,means.
528,I.,
529,I.,"It is, essentially, that kind of beauty which I began by saying"
530,I.,"belonged to realistic art, to the art which is not squeamish about the"
531,I.,"object which it represents, but is squeamish about the manner and medium"
532,I.,"in which that indifferent object is represented; it is a kind of beauty,"
533,I.,"therefore, more akin to that of Rembrandt and Velasquez than to that of"
534,I.,"Michael Angelo or Raphael. It is the beauty, not of large lines and"
535,I.,"harmonies, beauty residing in the real model's forms, beauty real,"
536,I.,"wholesale, which would be the same if the man were not marble but flesh,"
537,I.,not in a given position but moving; but it is a beauty of combinations
538,I.,"of light and surface, a beauty of texture opposed to texture, which"
539,I.,would probably be unperceived in the presence of the more regal beauty
540,I.,"of line and colour harmonies, and which those who could obtain this"
541,I.,latter would employ only as much as they were conducive to such larger
542,I.,beauties. And this beauty of texture opposed to texture and light
543,I.,combined with surface is a very real thing; it is the great reality of
544,I.,"Renaissance sculpture: this beauty, resulting from the combination, for"
545,I.,"instance, in a commonplace face, of the roughness and coarser pore of"
546,I.,the close shaven lips and chin with the smoothness of the waxy hanging
547,I.,"cheeks; the one catching the light, the other breaking it into a ribbed"
548,I.,and forked penumbra. The very perfection of this kind of work is
549,I.,Benedetto da Maiano's bust of Pietro Mellini in the Bargello at
550,I.,"Florence. The elderly head is of strongly marked osseous structure, yet"
551,I.,"fleshed with abundant and flaccid flesh, hanging in folds or creases"
552,I.,"round the mouth and chin, yet not flobbery and floppy, but solid, though"
553,I.,"yielding, creased, wrinkled, crevassed rather as a sandy hillside is"
554,I.,"crevassed by the trickling waters; semi-solid, promising slight"
555,I.,"resistance, waxy, yielding to the touch. But all the flesh has, as it"
556,I.,"were, gravitated to the lower part of the face, conglomerated, or rather"
557,I.,"draped itself, about the mouth, firmer for sunken teeth and shaving; and"
558,I.,"the skin has remained alone across the head, wrinkled, yet drawn in"
559,I.,"tight folds across the dome-shaped skull, as if, while the flesh"
560,I.,"disappeared, the bone also had enlarged. And on the temples the flesh"
561,I.,"has once been thick, the bone (seemingly) slight; and now the skin is"
562,I.,"being drawn, recently, and we feel more and more every day, into a"
563,I.,"radiation of minute creases, as if the bone and flesh were having a last"
564,I.,struggle. Now in this head there is little beauty of line (the man has
565,I.,"never been good-looking), and there is not much character in the sense"
566,I.,"of strongly marked mental or moral personality. I do not know, nor care,"
567,I.,"what manner of man this may have been. The individuality is one, not of"
568,I.,"the mind but of the flesh. What interests, attaches, is not the"
569,I.,"character or temperament, but the bone and skin, the creases and folds"
570,I.,of flesh. And herein also lies the beauty of the work. I do not mean its
571,I.,"interest or mere technical skill, I mean distinctly visible and artistic"
572,I.,beauty.
573,I.,
574,I.,"Thus does the sculptor of the Renaissance get beauty, visible beauty,"
575,I.,"not psychologic interest, out of a plain human being; but the beauty"
576,I.,(and this is the distinguishing point of what I must call realistic
577,I.,decorative art) does not exist necessarily in the plain human being: he
578,I.,merely affords the beginning of a pattern which the artist may be able
579,I.,to carry out. A person may have in him the making of a really beautiful
580,I.,bust and yet be ugly; just as the same person may afford a subject for a
581,I.,splendid painting and for an execrable piece of sculpture. The wrinkles
582,I.,and creases in a face like that of Benedetto da Maiano's Mellini would
583,I.,"probably be ugly and perhaps disgusting in the real reddish, flaccid,"
584,I.,discoloured flesh; while they are admirable in the solid and
585,I.,"supple-looking marble, in its warm and delicate bistre and yellow."
586,I.,"Material has an extraordinary effect upon form; colour, though not a"
587,I.,"positive element in sculpture, has immense negative power in"
588,I.,accentuating or obliterating the mere line. All form becomes vague and
589,I.,soft in the dairy flaccidness of modern ivory; and clear and powerful in
590,I.,"the dark terra cotta, which can ennoble even the fattest and flattest"
591,I.,"faces with its wonderful faculty for making mere surface markings, mere"
592,I.,"crowsfeet, interesting. Thus also with bronze: the polished, worked"
593,I.,"bronze, of fine chocolate burnish and reddish reflections, mars all"
594,I.,"beauty of line; how different the unchased, merely rough cast, greenish,"
595,I.,"with infinite delicate greys and browns, making, for instance, the head"
596,I.,"of an old woman like an exquisite withered, shrivelled, veined autumnal"
597,I.,"leaf. It is moreover, as I have said, a question of combination of"
598,I.,"surface and light, this art which makes beautiful busts of ugly men. The"
599,I.,ideal statue of the Greeks intended for the open air; fit to be looked
600,I.,"at under any light, high or low, brilliant or veiled, had indeed to be"
601,I.,prepared to look well under any light; but to look well under any light
602,I.,means not to use any one particular relation of light as an ally; the
603,I.,"surface was kept modestly subordinated to the features, the features"
604,I.,which must needs look well at all moments and from all points of view.
605,I.,But the Renaissance sculptor knew where his work would be placed; he
606,I.,could calculate the effect of the light falling invariably through this
607,I.,"or that window; he could make a fellow-workman of that light, present"
608,I.,"for it to draw or to obliterate what features he liked, bid it sweep"
609,I.,"away such or such surfaces with a broad stream, cut them with a deep"
610,I.,"shadow, caress their smooth chiselling or their rough grainings, mark as"
611,I.,with a nail the few large strokes of the point which gave the firmness
612,I.,"to the strained muscle or stretched skin. Out of this model of his, this"
613,I.,"plain old burgess, he and his docile friend the light, could make quite"
614,I.,"a new thing; a new pattern of bosses and cavities, of smooth sweeps and"
615,I.,"tracked lines, of creases and folds of flesh, of pliable linen and rough"
616,I.,"brocade of dress: something new, something which, without a single"
617,I.,"feature being straightened or shortened, yet changed completely the"
618,I.,value of the whole assemblage of features; something undreamed of by
619,I.,nature in moulding that ugly old merchant or humanist. With this art
620,I.,which produced works like Desiderio da Settignano's Carlo Marsuppini and
621,I.,"Benedetto da Maiano's Pietro Mellini, is intimately connected the art of"
622,I.,"the great medallists of the Renaissance--Pasti, Guacialotti, Niccolò"
623,I.,"Fiorentino, and, greatest of all, Pisanello. Its excellence depends"
624,I.,"precisely upon its independence of the ideal work of Antiquity; nay,"
625,I.,"even upon the fact that, while the ancients, striking their coins in"
626,I.,"chased metal dies, obtained an astonishing minuteness and clearness of"
627,I.,"every separate little stroke and dint, and were therefore forced into an"
628,I.,"almost more than sculptural perfection of mere line, of mere profile and"
629,I.,"throat and elaborately composed hair, a sort of sublime abstraction of"
630,I.,"the possible beauty of a human face, as in the coins of Syracuse and"
631,I.,also of Alexander; the men of the fifteenth century employed the process
632,I.,of casting the bronze in a concave mould obtained by the melting away of
633,I.,"a medallion in wax; in wax, which taking the living impress of the"
634,I.,"artist's finger, and recalling in its firm and yet soft texture the real"
635,I.,"substance of the human face, insensibly led the medallist to seek, not"
636,I.,"sharp and abstract lines, but simple, strongly moulded bosses; not ideal"
637,I.,"beauty, but the real appearance of life. It is, moreover, a significant"
638,I.,"fact that while the men who, half a century or so later, made fine,"
639,I.,"characterless die-stamped medals in imitation of the antique, Caradossi"
640,I.,"and Benvenuto for instance, were goldsmiths and sculptors, workers with"
641,I.,"the chisel, artists seeking essentially for abstract elegance of line;"
642,I.,"the two greatest medallists of the early Renaissance, Vittore Pisano and"
643,I.,"Matteo di Pasti, were both of them painters; and painters of the"
644,I.,"Northern Italian school, to whom colour and texture were all important,"
645,I.,"and linear form a matter of indifference. And indeed, if we look at the"
646,I.,best work of what I may call the wax mould medallists of the fifteenth
647,I.,"century, even at the magnificent marble medallions of the"
648,I.,laurel-wreathed head of Sigismund Malatesta on the pillars of his church
649,I.,"at Rimini, modelled by Pasti, we shall see that these men were"
650,I.,preoccupied almost exclusively with the almost pictorial effect of the
651,I.,flesh in its various degrees of boss and of reaction of the light; and
652,I.,"that the character, the beauty even, which they attained, is essentially"
653,I.,"due to a skilful manipulation of texture, and surface, and light--one"
654,I.,might almost say of colour. We all know Pisanello's famous heads of the
655,I.,"Malatesti of Rimini: the saturnine Sigismund, the delicate dapper"
656,I.,"Novello, the powerful yet beautiful Isotta; but there are other"
657,I.,"Renaissance medals which illustrate my meaning even better, and connect"
658,I.,my feelings on the subject of this branch of art more clearly with my
659,I.,feelings towards such work as Benedetto's Pietro Mellini. Foremost among
660,I.,"these is the perhaps somewhat imperfect and decidedly grotesque, but"
661,I.,"astonishingly powerful, naïf and characteristic Lorenzo dei Medici by"
662,I.,Niccolò real grandeur of whose conception of this coarse yet imaginative
663,I.,head may be profitably contrasted with the classicizing efforts after
664,I.,the demi-god or successor of Alexander in Pollaiolo's famous medal of
665,I.,the Pazzi conspiracy. Next to this I would place a medal by Guacialotti
666,I.,"of Bishop Niccolò Palmieri, with the motto, ""Nudus egressus sic"
667,I.,"redibo""--singularly appropriate to the shameless fleshliness of the"
668,I.,"personage, with his naked fat chest and shoulders, his fat, pig-like"
669,I.,"cheeks and greasy-looking bald head; a hideous beast, yet magnificent in"
670,I.,"his bestiality like some huge fattened porker. These medals give us, as"
671,I.,"does the bust of Pietro Mellini, beauty of the portrait despite ugliness"
672,I.,"of the original. But there are two other medals, this time by Pisanello,"
673,I.,"and, as it seems to me, perhaps his masterpieces, which show the quite"
674,I.,"peculiar way in which this homely charm of portraiture amalgamates, so"
675,I.,"as to form a homogeneous and most seemingly simple whole, with the"
676,I.,homely charm of certain kinds of pure and simple youthful types. One of
677,I.,"these (the reverse of which fantastically represents the four elements,"
678,I.,"the wooded earth, the starry sky, the rippled sea, the sun, all in one"
679,I.,sphere) is the portrait of Don Inigo d'Avalos; the other that of Cecilia
680,I.,Gonzaga. This slender beardless boy in the Spanish shovel hat and wisp
681,I.,"of scarf twisted round the throat; and this tall, long-necked girl, with"
682,I.,"sloping shoulders and still half-developed bosom; are, so to speak,"
683,I.,"brother and sister in art, in Pisanello's wonderful genius. The relief"
684,I.,"of the two medals is extremely low, so that in certain lights the"
685,I.,"effigies vanish almost completely, sink into the pale green surface of"
686,I.,"the bronze; the portraits are a mere film, a sort of haze which has"
687,I.,"arisen on the bronze and gathered into human likeness; but in this film,"
688,I.,"this scarce perceptible relief, we are made to perceive the slender"
689,I.,"osseous structure, the smooth, sleek, childish blond flesh and hair, the"
690,I.,"delicate, undecided pallor of extreme youth and purity, even as we might"
691,I.,"in some elaborate portrait by Velasquez, but with a spring-like"
692,I.,"healthiness which Velasquez, painting his lymphatic Hapsburgs, rarely"
693,I.,has.
694,I.,
695,I.,"Such is this Renaissance art of medals, this side branch of the great"
696,I.,"realistic portraiture in stone of the Benedettos, Desiderios, and"
697,I.,"Rossellinos; a perfect thing in itself; and one which, if we muse over"
698,I.,it in connection with the more important works of fifteenth century
699,I.,"sculpture, will perhaps lead us to think that, as the sculpture of"
700,I.,"Antiquity, in its superb idealism, its devotion to the perfect line and"
701,I.,"curve of beauty, achieved the highest that mere colourless art can"
702,I.,"achieve--thanks to the very purity, sternness, and narrowness of its"
703,I.,"sculpturesque feeling--so also, perhaps, modern sculpture, should it"
704,I.,"ever re-arise, must be a continuation of the tendencies of the"
705,I.,"Renaissance, must be the humbler sister of painting, must seek for the"
706,I.,"realistic portrait and begin, perhaps, with the realistic medal."

714,II.,"This kind of realism, where only the model is ugly, while the portrait"
715,II.,is beautiful; which seeks decorative value by other means than the
716,II.,"intrinsic excellence of form in the object represented, this kind of"
717,II.,"realism is quite different in sort from the realisms of immature art,"
718,II.,"which, aiming at nothing beyond a faithful copy, is content with"
719,II.,producing an ugly picture of an ugly thing. Now this latter kind of
720,II.,realism endured in painting some time after decorative realism such as I
721,II.,have described had reached perfection in sculpture. Nor was it till
722,II.,"later, and when the crude scholastic realism had completely come to an"
723,II.,"end, that there became even partially possible in painting decorative"
724,II.,realism analogous to what we have noticed in sculpture; while it was not
725,II.,till after the close of the Italian Renaissance period that the painters
726,II.,arose in Spain and the Netherlands who were able to treat their subjects
727,II.,with the uncompromising decorative realism of Desiderio or Rosellino or
728,II.,Benedetto da Maiano. For the purely imitative realism of the painters of
729,II.,"the early Renaissance was succeeded in Italy by idealism, which matured"
730,II.,in the great art of intrinsically beautiful linear form of Michael
731,II.,"Angelo and Raphael, and the great art of intrinsically beautiful colour"
732,II.,"form of Giorgione and Titian. These two schools were bound to be, each"
733,II.,"in its degree, idealistic. Complete power of mere representation in"
734,II.,tint and colour having been obtained through the realistic drudgery of
735,II.,"the early Renaissance, selection in the objects thus to be represented"
736,II.,had naturally arisen; and the study of the antique had further hastened
737,II.,"and directed this movement of art no longer to study but to achieve, to"
738,II.,"be decorative once more, decorative no longer in subservience to"
739,II.,"architecture, but as the separate and self-sufficing art of painting."
740,II.,"Selection, therefore, which is the only practical kind of idealism, had"
741,II.,begun as soon as painting was possessed of the power of representing
742,II.,"objects in their relations of line and colour, with that amount of light"
743,II.,and shadow requisite to the just appreciation of the relations of form
744,II.,and the just relations of colour. Now art which stops short at this
745,II.,"point of representation must inevitably be, if decorative at all,"
746,II.,idealistically decorative; it must be squeamish respecting the objects
747,II.,"represented, respecting their real structure, colour, position, and"
748,II.,"grouping. For, of the visible impressions received from an object, some"
749,II.,"are far more intrinsic than others. Suppose we see a woman, beautiful in"
750,II.,"the structure of her body, and beautiful in the colour of her person and"
751,II.,"her draperies, standing under a light which is such as we should call"
752,II.,beautiful and interesting: of these three qualities one will be
753,II.,"intrinsic in the woman, the second very considerably so, the third not"
754,II.,"at all. For, let us call that woman away and replace her immediately by"
755,II.,another woman chosen at random. We shall immediately perceive that we
756,II.,"have lost one pleasurable impression, that of beautiful bodily"
757,II.,structure: the woman has taken away her well-shapen body. Next we shall
758,II.,perceive a notable diminution in the second pleasurable impression: the
759,II.,"woman has taken with her, not indeed her well-tinted garments, which we"
760,II.,"may have bestowed on her successor, but her beautifully coloured skin"
761,II.,"and hair, so that of the pleasing colour-impression will remain only as"
762,II.,"much as was due to, and may have been retained with, the original"
763,II.,"woman's clothes. But if we look for our third pleasurable impression,"
764,II.,"our beautiful light, we shall find that unchanged, whether it fall upon"
765,II.,"a magnificently arrayed goddess or upon a sordid slut And, conversely,"
766,II.,"the beautiful woman, when withdrawn from that light and placed in any"
767,II.,"other, will be equally lovely in form, even if we cast her in plaster,"
768,II.,and lose the colour of her skin and hair; or if we leave her not only
769,II.,"the beautiful tints of her flesh and hair, but her own splendidly"
770,II.,"coloured garments, we shall still have, in whatsoever light, a"
771,II.,magnificent piece of colour. But if we recall the poor ugly creature who
772,II.,"has succeeded her from out of that fine effect of light, we shall have"
773,II.,nothing but a hideous form invested in hideous colour.
774,II.,
775,II.,This rough diagram will be sufficient to explain my thought respecting
776,II.,"the relative degree to which the art dealing with linear form, that"
777,II.,"dealing with colour and that dealing with light, with the medium in"
778,II.,which form and colour are perceived; is each respectively bound to be
779,II.,idealistically or realistically decorative. Now painting was
780,II.,"æsthetically mature, possessed the means to achieve great beauty, at a"
781,II.,time when of the three modes of representation there had as yet
782,II.,developed only those of linear form and colour; and the very possibility
783,II.,and necessity of immediately achieving all that could be achieved by
784,II.,these means delayed for a long time the development of the third mode of
785,II.,representation: the representation of objects as they appear with
786,II.,reference to the light through which they are seen. A beginning had
787,II.,"indeed been made. Certain of Correggio's effects of light, even more an"
788,II.,"occasional manner of treating the flesh and hair, reducing both form and"
789,II.,"colour to a kind of vague boss and vague sheen, such as they really"
790,II.,"present in given effects of light, a something which we define roughly"
791,II.,as eminently modern in the painting of his clustered cherubs; all this
792,II.,is certainly a beginning of the school of Velasquez. Still more so is it
793,II.,"the case with Andrea del Sarto, the man of genius whom critics love to"
794,II.,"despatch as a mediocrity, because his art, which is art altogether for"
795,II.,"the eyes, and in which he innovated more than any of his contemporaries,"
796,II.,does not afford any excuse for the irrelevancies of ornamental
797,II.,"criticism; with him the appearance of form and colour, acted upon by"
798,II.,"light, the relative values of which flesh and draperies consist with"
799,II.,"reference to the surrounding medium, all this becomes so evident a"
800,II.,"preoccupation and a basis for decorative effects, as to give certain of"
801,II.,his works an almost startling air of being modern. But this tendency
802,II.,comes to nothing: the men of the sixteenth century appear scarcely to
803,II.,"have perceived wherein lay the true excellence of this ""Andrea senza"
804,II.,"errori,"" deeming him essentially the artist of linear perfection; while"
805,II.,the innovations of Correggio in the way of showing the relations of
806,II.,flesh tones and light ended in the mere coarse gala illuminations in
807,II.,which his successors made their seraphs plunge and sprawl. There was too
808,II.,"much to be done, good and bad, in the way of mere linear form and mere"
809,II.,"colour; and as art of mere linear form and colour, indifferent of all"
810,II.,"else, did the art of the Italian Renaissance run to seed."
811,II.,
812,II.,I said at the beginning of this paper that the degree to which any art
813,II.,"is strictly idealistic, can be measured by the terms which it will make"
814,II.,with portrait. For as portrait is due to the desire to represent a
815,II.,"person quite apart from that person affording material for decoration,"
816,II.,it is evident that only the art which can call in the assistance of
817,II.,"decorative materials, independent of the represented individual, can"
818,II.,possibly make a beautiful picture out of an ugly man; while the art
819,II.,which deals only with such visible peculiarities as are inherent in the
820,II.,"individual, has no kind of outlet, is cornered, and can make of a"
821,II.,repulsive original only a repulsive picture. The analogy to this we have
822,II.,"already noticed in sculpture: antique sculpture, considering only the"
823,II.,"linear bosses which existed equally in the living man and in the statue,"
824,II.,"could not afford to represent plain people; while Renaissance sculpture,"
825,II.,extracting a large amount of beauty out of combinations of surface and
826,II.,"light, was able, as long as it could arrange such an artificial"
827,II.,"combination, to dispense with great perfection in the model. Nay, if we"
828,II.,"except Renaissance statuary as a kind of separate art, we may say that"
829,II.,"this independence of the object portrayed is a kind of analytic test,"
830,II.,"enabling us to judge at a glance, and by the degree of independence from"
831,II.,"the model, the degree to which any art is removed from the mere line and"
832,II.,boss of antique sculpture. In the statue standing free in any light that
833,II.,"may chance to come, every form must be beautiful from every point; but"
834,II.,"in proportion as the new elements of painting enter, in proportion as"
835,II.,"the actual linear form and boss is marked and helped out by grouping,"
836,II.,"colour, and light and shade, does the actual perfection of the model"
837,II.,"become less important; until, under the reign of light as the chief"
838,II.,"factor, it becomes altogether indifferent. In this fact lies the only"
839,II.,"rational foundation for the notion, made popular by Hegel, that painting"
840,II.,is an art in which beauty is of much less account than in sculpture;
841,II.,"failing to understand that the sum total of beauty remained the same,"
842,II.,whether dependent upon the concentration of a single element or obtained
843,II.,by the co-operation of several consequently less singly important
844,II.,elements.
845,II.,
846,II.,"But to return to the question of portrait art. From what we have seen,"
847,II.,it is clear that art which requires perfection of form will be reduced
848,II.,"to ugliness if cramped in the obtaining of such perfection, whereas art"
849,II.,which can obtain beauty by other means will still have a chance when
850,II.,reduced to imitate ugly object? Hence it is that while the realistically
851,II.,decorative art of the seventeenth century can make actually beautiful
852,II.,"things of the portraits of ugly people, the idealistically decorative"
853,II.,art of the Renaissance produces portraits which are cruelly ugly in
854,II.,proportion as the art is purely idealistic. Yet even in idealism there
855,II.,"are degrees: the more the art is confined to mere linear form, to the"
856,II.,"exclusion of colour, the uglier will be the portraits. With Michael"
857,II.,Angelo the difficulty was simplified to impossibility: he could not
858,II.,paint portrait at all; and in his sculptured portraits of the two
859,II.,"Medicean dukes at S. Lorenzo he evaded all attempt at likeness, making"
860,II.,"those two men into scarcely more than two architectural monsters,"
861,II.,half-human cousins of the fantastic creatures who keep watch on the
862,II.,belfries and gurgoyles of a Gothic cathedral. It is almost impossible to
863,II.,think of Michael Angelo attempting portrait: the man's genius cannot be
864,II.,"constrained to it, and what ought to be mere ugliness would come out"
865,II.,idealized into grandiose monstrosity. Men like Titian and Tintoret are
866,II.,at the other end of the scale of ideal decoration: they are bordering
867,II.,"upon the domain of realism. Hence they can raise into interest, by the"
868,II.,"mere power of colour, many an insignificant type; yet even they are"
869,II.,"incapable of dealing with absolute ugliness, with absence of fine"
870,II.,"colour, or, if they do deal with it, there is an immediate improvement"
871,II.,"upon the model, and the appearance of truthfulness goes. Between the"
872,II.,"absolute incapacity for dealing with ugliness of Michael Angelo, and the"
873,II.,"power of compromising with it of Titian and Tintoret, Raphael stands"
874,II.,half-way: he can call in the assistance of colour just sufficiently to
875,II.,"create a setting of carefully harmonized draperies and accessories,"
876,II.,beautiful enough to allow of his filling it up with the most cruelly
877,II.,ugly likeness which any painter ever painted. Far too much has been
878,II.,"written about Raphael in general, but not half enough about Raphael as a"
879,II.,"portrait-painter; for by the side of the eclectic idealist, who combined"
880,II.,"and balanced beauty almost into insipidity, is the most terribly,"
881,II.,inflexibly veracious portrait-painter that ever was. Compared with those
882,II.,"sternly straightforward portraits of his Florentine and Roman time,"
883,II.,"where ugliness and baseness are never attenuated by one tittle, and"
884,II.,"alloyed nobility or amiability, as with his finer models, like the two"
885,II.,"Donis, husband and wife, and Bibbiena, is never purified of its"
886,II.,troubling element; compared with them the Venetian portraits are mere
887,II.,"insincere, enormously idealized pieces of colour-harmony; nay, the"
888,II.,portraits of Velasquez are mere hints--given rapidly by a sickened
889,II.,"painter striving to make those scrofulous Hapsburgs no longer mere men,"
890,II.,but keynotes of harmonies of light--of what the people really are. For
891,II.,"Velasquez seems to show us the temperament, the potentiality of his"
892,II.,"people, and to leave us, with a kind of dignified and melancholy silence"
893,II.,"as to all further, to find out what life, what feelings and actions,"
894,II.,such a temperament implies. But Raphael shows us all: the temperament
895,II.,"and the character, the real active creature, with all the marks of his"
896,II.,"present temper and habits, with all the indications of his immediate"
897,II.,"actions upon him: completely without humour or bitterness, without the"
898,II.,"smallest tendency to twist the reality into caricature or monstrosity,"
899,II.,"nay, perhaps without much psychologic analysis to tell him the exact"
900,II.,"meaning of what he is painting, going straight to the point, and utterly"
901,II.,ruthless from sheer absence of all alternative of doing otherwise than
902,II.,"he does. There is nothing more cruelly realistic in the world, cruel not"
903,II.,"only to the base originals but to the feelings of the spectator, than"
904,II.,"the harmony of villainies, of various combinations of black and hog-like"
905,II.,"bestiality, and fox and wolf-like cunning and ferocity with wicked human"
906,II.,"thought and self-command, which Raphael has enshrined in that splendid"
907,II.,"harmony of scarlet silk and crimson satin, and purple velvet and dull"
908,II.,"white brocade, as the portraits of Leo X. and his cardinals Rossi and"
909,II.,Dei Medici.
910,II.,
911,II.,"The idealistic painter, accustomed to rely upon the intrinsic beauty"
912,II.,which he has hitherto been able to select or create; accustomed also to
913,II.,think of form as something quite independent of the medium through which
914,II.,"it is seen, scarcely conscious of the existence of light and air in his"
915,II.,"habit of concentrating all attention upon a figure placed, as it were,"
916,II.,in a sort of vacuum of indifference;--this idealistic artist is left
917,II.,without any resources when bid to paint an ugly man or woman. With the
918,II.,"realistic artist, to whom the man or woman is utterly indifferent, to"
919,II.,"whom the medium in which they are seen is everything, the case Is just"
920,II.,"reversed: let him arrange his light, his atmospheric effect, and he will"
921,II.,work into their pattern no matter what plain or repulsive wretch. To
922,II.,"Velasquez the flaccid yellowish fair flesh, with its grey downy shadows,"
923,II.,"the limp pale drab hair, which is grey in the light and scarcely"
924,II.,"perceptibly blond in the shade, all this unhealthy, bloodless, feebly"
925,II.,"living, effete mass of humanity called Philip IV. of Spain, shivering in"
926,II.,"moral anæmia like some dog thorough bred into nothingness, becomes"
927,II.,"merely the foundation for a splendid harmony of pale tints. Again, the"
928,II.,"poor little baby princess, with scarce visible features, seemingly"
929,II.,kneaded (but not sufficiently pinched and modelled) out of the wet ashes
930,II.,"of an _auto da fè_, in her black-and-white frock (how different from the"
931,II.,"dresses painted by Raphael and Titian!), dingy and gloomy enough for an"
932,II.,"abbess or a cameriera major, this childish personification of courtly"
933,II.,"dreariness, certainly born on an Ash Wednesday, becomes the principal"
934,II.,"strands for a marvellous tissue of silvery and ashy light, tinged"
935,II.,"yellowish in the hair, bluish in the eyes and downy cheeks, pale red in"
936,II.,the lips and the rose in the hair; something to match which in beauty
937,II.,"you must think of some rarely seen veined and jaspered rainy twilight,"
938,II.,"or opal-tinted hazy winter morning. Ugliness, nay, repulsiveness,"
939,II.,"vanish, subdued into beauty, even as noxious gases may be subdued into"
940,II.,health-giving substances by some cunning chemist. The difference between
941,II.,such portraits as these and the portraits by Raphael does not however
942,II.,consist merely in the beauty: there is also the fact that if you take
943,II.,"one of Velasquez's portraits out of their frame, reconstitute the living"
944,II.,"individual, and bid him walk forth in whatsoever light may fall upon"
945,II.,"him, you will have something infinitely different from the portrait, and"
946,II.,of which your only distinct feeling will be that a fine portrait might
947,II.,be made of the creature; whereas it is a matter of complete indifference
948,II.,whether you see Raphael's Leo X. in the flesh or in his gilded frame.
949,II.,
950,II.,Whatever may fairly be said respecting the relative value of idealistic
951,II.,and realistic decorative art is really also connected with this latter
952,II.,point. Considering that realistic art is merely obtaining beauty by
953,II.,"attention to other factors than those which preoccupy idealistic art,"
954,II.,that the one fulfils what the other neglects--taking the matter from
955,II.,"this point of view, it would seem as if the two kinds of arts were, so"
956,II.,"to speak, morally equal; and that any vague sense of mysterious"
957,II.,superior dignity clinging to idealistic art was a mere shred of long
958,II.,discarded pedantry. But it is not so. For realistic art does more than
959,II.,"merely bring into play powers unknown to idealistic art: it becomes, by"
960,II.,"the possession of these powers, utterly indifferent to the intrinsic"
961,II.,value of the forms represented: it is so certain of making everything
962,II.,lovely by its harmonies of light and atmosphere that it almost prefers
963,II.,to choose inferior things for this purpose. I am thinking at present of
964,II.,"a picture by I forget what Dutchman in our National Gallery,"
965,II.,"representing in separate compartments five besotten-looking creatures,"
966,II.,"symbolical of the five senses: they are ugly, brutish, with I know not"
967,II.,what suggestion of detestable temperament in their bloodshot flesh and
968,II.,"vermilion lips, as if the whole man were saturated with his appetite."
969,II.,Yet the Dutchman has found the means of making these degraded types into
970,II.,"something which we care to look at, and to look at on account of its"
971,II.,"beauty; even as, in lesser degree, Rubens has always managed to make us"
972,II.,"feel towards his flaccid, veal-complexioned, fish-eyed women, something"
973,II.,of what we feel towards the goddesses of the Parthenon; towards the
974,II.,"white-robed, long-gloved ladies, with meditative face beneath their"
975,II.,"crimped auburn hair, of Titian."
976,II.,
977,II.,"Viewed in one way, there is a kind of nobility in the very fact that"
978,II.,"such realistic art can make us pardon, can redeem, nay almost sanctify,"
979,II.,"so much. But is it right thus to pardon, redeem, and sanctify; thus to"
980,II.,"bring the inferior on to the level of the superior? Nay, is it not"
981,II.,rather wrong to teach us to endure so much meanness and ugliness in
982,II.,"creatures, on account of the nobility with which they are represented?"
983,II.,"Is this not vitiating our feelings, blunting our desire for the better,"
984,II.,our repugnance for the worse?
985,II.,
986,II.,"A great and charitable art, this realistic art of the seventeenth"
987,II.,"century, and to be respected for its very tenderness towards the scorned"
988,II.,"and castaway things of reality; but accustoming us, perhaps too much,"
989,II.,"like all charitable and reclaiming impulses, to certain unworthy"
990,II.,contacts: in strange contrast herein with that narrow but ascetic and
991,II.,"aristocratic art of idealism, which, isolated and impoverished though it"
992,II.,"may be, has always the dignity of its immaculate purity, of its"
993,II.,"unswerving judgment, of its obstinate determination to deal only with"
994,II.,"the best. A hard task to judge between them. But be this as it may, it"
995,II.,is one of the singular richnesses of the Italian Renaissance that it
996,II.,knew of both tendencies; that while in painting it gave the equivalent
997,II.,of that rigid idealism of the Greeks which can make no compromise with
998,II.,ugliness; in sculpture it possessed the equivalent of the realism of
999,II.,"Velasquez, which can make beauty out of ugly things, even as the chemist"
1000,II.,can make sugar out of vitriol.

1014,I.,"Throughout the tales of Charlemagne and his warriors, overtopping by far"
1015,I.,"the crowd of paladins and knights, move two colossal mailed and vizored"
1016,I.,"figures--Roland, whom the Italians call Orlando and the Spaniards"
1017,I.,"Roldan, the son of Milon d'Angers and of Charlemagne's sister; and"
1018,I.,"Renaud or Rinaldo, the lord of Montauban, and eldest of the famous four"
1019,I.,"sons of Aymon. These are the two representative heroes, equal but"
1020,I.,"opposed, the Achilles and Odysseus, the Siegfried and Dietrich, of the"
1021,I.,"Carolingian epic; and in each is personified, by the unconscious genius"
1022,I.,"of the early Middle Ages, one of the great political movements, of the"
1023,I.,"heroic struggles, of feudalism. For there existed in feudalism two"
1024,I.,"forces, a centripetal and a centrifugal--a force which made for the"
1025,I.,"supremacy of the kingly overlordship, and a force which made for the"
1026,I.,"independence of the great vassals. Hence, in the poetry which is the"
1027,I.,"poetry of feudalism, two distinct currents of feeling, two distinct"
1028,I.,epics---the epic of the devoted loyalty of all the heroes of France to
1029,I.,"their wise and mighty emperor Charlemagne, triumphant even in"
1030,I.,misfortune; and the epic of the hopeless resistance against a craven and
1031,I.,capricious despot Charles of the most righteous and whole-hearted among
1032,I.,"his feudatories: the epic of Roland, and the epic of Renaud. Of the"
1033,I.,"first there remains to us, in its inflexible and iron solemnity, an"
1034,I.,"original rhymed narrative, ""The Chanson de Roland,"" which we may read"
1035,I.,perhaps almost in the self-same words in which it was sung by the
1036,I.,Normans of William in their night watch before the great battle. The
1037,I.,"centripetal force of feudalism gained the upper hand, and the song of"
1038,I.,"the great empire, of the great deeds of loyal prowess, was consecrated"
1039,I.,in the feudal monarchy. The case was different with the tale of
1040,I.,resistance and rebellion. The story of Renaud soon became a dangerous
1041,I.,lesson for the great barons; it fell from the hands of the nobles to
1042,I.,those of humbler folk; and it is preserved to us no longer in mediæval
1043,I.,"verse, but in a prose version, doubtless of the fifteenth century, under"
1044,I.,"the name, familiar on the stalls of village fairs, of ""The Quatre Fils"
1045,I.,"Aymon."" But, as Renaud is the equal of Roland, so is this humble prose"
1046,I.,tale nevertheless the equal of the great song of Roncevaux; and even
1047,I.,"now, it would be a difficult task to decide which were the grander, the"
1048,I.,tale of loyalty or the tale of resistance.
1049,I.,
1050,I.,"In each of these tales,""The Chanson de Roland"" and ""The Quatre Fils"
1051,I.,"Aymon,"" there is contained a picture of its respective hero, which sums"
1052,I.,"up, as it were, the whole noble character of the book; and which, the"
1053,I.,"picture of the dying Roland and the picture of the dying Renaud, I would"
1054,I.,fain bring before you before speaking of the other Roland and the other
1055,I.,"Renaud, the Orlando of Ariosto and the Rinaldo of Boiardo. The traitor"
1056,I.,Ganelon has enabled King Marsile to overtake with all his heathenness
1057,I.,the rear-guard of Charlemagne between the granite walls of Roncevaux;
1058,I.,"the Franks have been massacred, but the Saracens have been routed;"
1059,I.,Roland has at last ceded to the prayers of Oliver and of Archbishop
1060,I.,Turpin; three times has he put to his mouth his oliphant and blown a
1061,I.,"blast to call back Charlemagne to vengeance, till the blood has foamed"
1062,I.,"round his lips and his temple has burst. Oliver is dead, the archbishop"
1063,I.,"is dying, Roland himself is slowly bleeding to death. He goes down into"
1064,I.,"the defile, heaped with corpses, and seeks for the bodies of the"
1065,I.,"principal paladins, Ivon and Ivaire, the Gascon Engelier, Gérier and"
1066,I.,"Gérin, Bérenger and Otho, Anseis and Salamon, and the old Gerard of"
1067,I.,Rousillon; and one by one drags them to where the archbishop lies dying.
1068,I.,"And then, when to these knights Roland has at last added his own beloved"
1069,I.,"comrade Oliver, he bids the archbishop bless all the dead, before he die"
1070,I.,"himself. Then, when he has reverently crossed Turpin's beautiful"
1071,I.,"priestly hands over his breast, he goes forth to shatter his sword"
1072,I.,Durendal against the rocks; but the good sword has cut the rock without
1073,I.,"shivering; and the coldness of death steals, over Roland. He stretches"
1074,I.,"himself upon a hillock looking towards Spain, and prays for the"
1075,I.,"forgiveness of his sins; then, with Durendal and his ivory horn by his"
1076,I.,"side, he stretches out the glove of his right hand to God. ""He has"
1077,I.,stretched forth to God the glove of his right hand; St. Gabriel has
1078,I.,"received it... Then his head has sunk on his arm; he has gone, with"
1079,I.,"clasped hands, to his end. God sends him one of his cherubim and St."
1080,I.,Michael of Peril. St. Gabriel has come with them. They carry the soul of
1081,I.,"the Count: up to paradise."""
1082,I.,
1083,I.,"More solitary, and solemn and sad even, is the end of the other hero, of"
1084,I.,"the great rebel Renaud of Montauban. At length, after a lifetime wasted"
1085,I.,"in fruitless, attempts to resist the iniquity of the emperor, to baffle"
1086,I.,"his power, to shame him by magnanimity into, justice, the four sons of"
1087,I.,"Aymon, who have given up their youth, their manhood, the dearest things"
1088,I.,"to their heart, respect to their father and loyalty to their sovereign,"
1089,I.,"rather than countenance the injustice of Charlemagne to their kinsman,"
1090,I.,"have at last obtained to be pardoned; to be pardoned, they, heroes, by"
1091,I.,"this, dastardly tyrant, and to quietly sink, broken-hearted into"
1092,I.,"nothingness. The eldest, Renaud, returning from his exile and the Holy"
1093,I.,"Land, finds that his wife Clarisse has pined for him and died; and"
1094,I.,"then, putting away his armour from him, and dressing in a pilgrim's"
1095,I.,"frock made of the purple serge of the dead lady's robe, he goes forth to"
1096,I.,"wander through the world; not very old in years, but broken-spirited; at"
1097,I.,"peace, but in solitude of heart. And one evening he arrives at Cologne."
1098,I.,"We can imagine the old knight, only half aware of the sunshine of the"
1099,I.,"evening, the noise of the streets, the looks of the crowd, the great"
1100,I.,"minster rising half-finished in the midst of the town by the Rhine, the"
1101,I.,"cries and noise and chipping of the masons; unconscious of all this,"
1102,I.,"half away: with his brothers hiding in the Ardennes, living on roots and"
1103,I.,"berries, at bay before Charlemagne; or wandering ragged and famishing"
1104,I.,"through France; with King Yon brilliant at Toulouse, seeing perhaps for"
1105,I.,"the first time his bride Clarisse, or the towers of Montauban rising"
1106,I.,"under the workmen's hands; thinking perhaps of the frightful siege, when"
1107,I.,"all, all had been eaten in the fortress, and his children Aymonnet and"
1108,I.,"Yonnet, all thin and white, knelt down and begged him to slaughter his"
1109,I.,"horse Bayard that they might eat; perhaps of that journey, when he and"
1110,I.,"his brothers, all in red-furred robes with roses in their hands, rode"
1111,I.,prisoners of King Charles across the plain of Vaucouleurs; perhaps of
1112,I.,"when he galloped up to the gallows at Montfaucon, and cut loose his"
1113,I.,"brother Richard; or of that daring ride to Paris, where he and his horse"
1114,I.,"won the race, snatched the prize from before Charlemagne and sped off"
1115,I.,"crying out that the winner was Renaud of Montauban; or, perhaps, seeing"
1116,I.,"once more the sad, sweet face of the Lady Clarisse, when she had burned"
1117,I.,"all her precious stuffs and tires in the castle-yard, and lay dead"
1118,I.,without him to kiss her cold mouth; of seeing once more his good horse
1119,I.,"Bayard, when he kissed him in his stall before giving him to be killed"
1120,I.,"by Charlemagne. Thinking of all that past, seeing it all within his"
1121,I.,"mind, and seeing but little of the present; as, in the low yellow light,"
1122,I.,"he helped, for his bread, the workmen to heave the great beams, to carry"
1123,I.,"the great stones of the cathedral, to split the huge marble masses while"
1124,I.,"they stared in astonished envy; as he sat, unconscious of their"
1125,I.,"mutterings, eating his dry bread and porridge in the building docks by"
1126,I.,"the river. And then, when wearied, he had sunk to sleep in the hay-loft,"
1127,I.,dreaming perchance that all this evil life was but a dream and the
1128,I.,awakening therefrom to happiness and strength; the jealous workmen came
1129,I.,"and killed him with their base tools, and cast him into the Rhine. They"
1130,I.,"say that the huge body floated on the water, surrounded by a great halo;"
1131,I.,"and that when the men of the banks, seeing this, reverently fished it"
1132,I.,"out, they found that the noble corpse was untouched by decay, and still"
1133,I.,"surrounded by a light of glory. And thus, it seems to me, this Renaud,"
1134,I.,"this rebel baron of whose reality we know nothing, has floated"
1135,I.,surrounded by a halo of poetry down the black flood of the Middle Ages
1136,I.,"(in which so much has sunk); and when we look upon his face, and see"
1137,I.,"its beauty and strength and solemness, we feel, like the people of the"
1138,I.,"Rhine bank, inclined to weep, and to say of this mysterious corpse,"
1139,I.,"""Surely this is some great saint."""
1140,I.,
1141,I.,"Of each of these heroes thus shown us by the Middle Ages, the Italian"
1142,I.,"Renaissance also, by the hand of two of her greatest poets, has given us"
1143,I.,"a picture. And first, of Roland. Of him, of Count Orlando, we are told"
1144,I.,"by Messer Lodovico Ariosto, that in consequence of his having"
1145,I.,"discovered, in a certain pleasant grotto among the ferns and maidenhair,"
1146,I.,"words graven on the rock (interrupted, doubtless, by the lover's kisses)"
1147,I.,which revealed that the Princess Angelica of Cathay had disdained him
1148,I.,"for Medoro, the fair-haired page of the King of the Moors; Count Orlando"
1149,I.,"went straightway out of his mind, and hanging up his armour and"
1150,I.,"stripping off his clothes, galloped about on his bare-backed horse,"
1151,I.,"slaughtering cows and sheep instead of Saracens; until it pleased God,"
1152,I.,"moved by the danger of Christendom and the prayers of Charlemagne, to"
1153,I.,"permit Astolfo to ride on the hippogriffs back up to the moon, and bring"
1154,I.,back thence the wits of the great paladin contained in a small phial. We
1155,I.,all know that merry tale. What the Renaissance has to say of Renaud of
1156,I.,"Montauban is even stranger and more fantastic. One day, says Matteo"
1157,I.,"Boiardo, in the fifteenth canto of the second part of his ""Orlando"
1158,I.,"Innamorato,"" as Rinaldo of Montalbano, the contemner of love, was riding"
1159,I.,"in the Ardennes, he came to a clearing in the forest, where, close to"
1160,I.,"the fountain of Merlin, a wonderful sight met his eyes. On a flowery"
1161,I.,"meadow were dancing three naked damsels, and singing with them danced"
1162,I.,"also a naked youth, dark of eyes and fair of hair, the first down on his"
1163,I.,"lips, so that some might have said it was and others that it was not"
1164,I.,there. On Rinaldo's approach they broke through their singing and
1165,I.,"dancing, and rushed upon him, pelting him with roses and hyacinths and"
1166,I.,"violets from their baskets, and beating him with great sheaves of"
1167,I.,"lilies, which burnt like flames through the plates of his armour to the"
1168,I.,"very marrow of his bones. Then when they had dragged him, tied with"
1169,I.,"garlands, by the feet round and round the meadow; wings, eyed not with"
1170,I.,"the eyes of a peacock but with the eyes of lovely damsels, suddenly"
1171,I.,"sprouted out of their shoulders, and they flew off, leaving the poor"
1172,I.,"baron, bruised on the grass, to meditate upon the vanity of all future"
1173,I.,resistance to love.
1174,I.,
1175,I.,Such are the things which the Middle Ages and the Renaissance found to
1176,I.,tell us of the two great heroes of Carolingian poetry. And the
1177,I.,"explanation of how it came to pass, that for the Roland of the song of"
1178,I.,"Roncevaux was substituted the Orlando of Ariosto, and for the Renaud of"
1179,I.,"""The Quatre Fils Aymon"" the Rinaldo of Matteo Boiardo--means simply that"
1180,I.,which I desire here to study: the metamorphoses of mediæval romance
1181,I.,"stuffs, and, more especially, the vicissitudes of the cycle of"
1182,I.,Charlemagne.
1183,I.,
1184,I.,
1185,I.,
1186,I.,
1187,II.,II.
1188,II.,
1189,II.,
1190,II.,We are apt to think of the Middle Ages as if they were the
1191,II.,companion-piece to Antiquity; but no such ideal correspondence exists
1192,II.,"between the two periods. Antiquity is all of a piece, and the Middle"
1193,II.,"Ages, on the contrary, are heterogeneous and chaotic. For Antiquity is"
1194,II.,the steady and uniform development of civilization in one direction and
1195,II.,with one meaning; there are great differences between its various
1196,II.,"epochs, but they are as the differences between the budding, the"
1197,II.,"blossoming, and the fading stages of one plant: life varies, but is one."
1198,II.,"The Middle Ages, on the other hand, are a series of false starts, of"
1199,II.,"interruptions and of new departures; a perpetual confusion. For, if we"
1200,II.,"think over them, we shall see that these centuries called mediæval are"
1201,II.,"occupied by the effort of one people, or one generation, to put to"
1202,II.,rights and settle down among as much as it can save of the civilization
1203,II.,of Antiquity. And the sudden overwhelming of this people or this
1204,II.,"generation by another, which puts all the elaborate arrangements into"
1205,II.,"disarray, adds to the ruins of Antiquity the ruins of more recent times;"
1206,II.,"and then this destroying generation tries to put things straight, to"
1207,II.,"settle down, and is in its turn interrupted by the advent of some new"
1208,II.,comer who begins the game afresh.
1209,II.,
1210,II.,"As it is with peoples, so also is it with ideas; scarcely has a scheme"
1211,II.,"of life or of philosophy or of art taken shape and consistence before,"
1212,II.,"from out of the inexhaustible chaos of mediæval thought and feeling,"
1213,II.,"there issue new necessities, new aspirations, which put into confusion"
1214,II.,all previous ones. The Middle Ages were like some financial crisis: a
1215,II.,"little time, a little credit, money will fructify, wealth will reappear,"
1216,II.,the difficult moment will be tided over; and so with civilization. But
1217,II.,unfortunately the wealth of ideas began to accumulate in the storehouse
1218,II.,"only just long enough to bring down a rout of creditors, people who"
1219,II.,"rifled the bank, and went home to consume or invest their money in order"
1220,II.,"to be succeeded by others. Hence, in the matter of civilization, the"
1221,II.,"Middle Ages ended in an extraordinary slow ruin, a bankruptcy like that"
1222,II.,"which overtook France before '89, and from which, as France was restored"
1223,II.,"by the bold seizure and breaking up of property of the revolution, the"
1224,II.,world was restored by the bold breaking of feudal and spiritual
1225,II.,"mortmain, the restoring of wasted energies to utility, of that great"
1226,II.,"double revolution, the Renaissance and the Reformation. Be this as it"
1227,II.,"may, mankind throughout the Middle Ages appears to have been in a"
1228,II.,"chronic condition of packing up and unpacking, and packing up again; one"
1229,II.,"after another a nation, a race, a philosophy, a political system came to"
1230,II.,the front and was pushed back again into limbo: Germans and Kelts and
1231,II.,"Latins, French civilization of the day of Abélard, Provençal"
1232,II.,"civilization of the days of the Raymonds, brilliant and evanescent"
1233,II.,"Hohenstauffen supremacy, papacy at Canossa and at Avignon, Templars"
1234,II.,"triumphant and Templars persecuted; scholasticism, mysticism, feudalism,"
1235,II.,"democracy, communism: influences all these perpetually rising up and"
1236,II.,"being trodden down, till they all rotted away in the great stagnation of"
1237,II.,"the fifteenth century; and only in one part of the world, where the"
1238,II.,"conflict was more speedily ended, where one set of tendencies early"
1239,II.,"triumphed, where stability was temporarily obtained, in Italy alone did"
1240,II.,civilization continue to be nurtured and developed for the benefit of
1241,II.,all mankind. In such a state of affairs only such things could flourish
1242,II.,"and mature as were safe from what I have called, for want of a better"
1243,II.,"expression, the perpetual unpacking and repacking, the perpetual being"
1244,II.,"on the move, of the Middle Ages; and among such things foremost was art,"
1245,II.,"the essential art of the times, architecture, which, belonging to the"
1246,II.,"small towns, to the infinite minority of the democracy, who worked and"
1247,II.,"made money and let the great changes pass over their heads, thrived"
1248,II.,almost as something too insignificant for notice. But it was different
1249,II.,with literature. Cathedrals once built cannot so easily be changed; new
1250,II.,"peoples, new ideas, must accept them. But poetry--the thing which every"
1251,II.,"nation insists upon having to suit its own taste, the thing which every"
1252,II.,"nation and every generation carries about with it hither and thither,"
1253,II.,"the thing which can be altered to suit every passing whim--poetry was,"
1254,II.,"of all the fluctuating things of the Middle Ages, perhaps the most"
1255,II.,"fluctuating. And fluctuating also because, as none of these various"
1256,II.,"nations, tendencies, aspirations, dominated sufficiently long to produce"
1257,II.,"any highly organized art, there remained no standard works, nothing"
1258,II.,"recognizedly perfect, which would be kept for its perfection and gather"
1259,II.,"round it imitations, so as to form the nucleus of any homogeneous"
1260,II.,"tradition. The Middle Ages, so full of fashions in literary matters,"
1261,II.,possessed no classics; the minnesingers knew nothing of the stern old
1262,II.,Teutonic war songs; the meistersängers had forgotten the minnesingers;
1263,II.,"the trouvères and troubadours knew nothing of ""The Chanson de Roland,"""
1264,II.,"and Villon knew nothing of them; only in Italy, where the Middle Ages"
1265,II.,"came to an end and the Renaissance began with the Lombard league, was"
1266,II.,"there established a tradition of excellence, with men like Dante,"
1267,II.,"Petrarch, and Boccaccio, handed down from generation to generation; even"
1268,II.,"as, while in the north there came about the strange modification which"
1269,II.,substituted the French of Rabelais for the French of Chrestien de
1270,II.,"Troyes, the German of Luther for the German of Wolfram von Eschenbach,"
1271,II.,"the Italian language, from Ciullo d'Alcamo almost to Boiardo and Lorenzo"
1272,II.,"dei Medici, remained virtually identical. The result of this, which I"
1273,II.,may call the heterogeneousness and instability of the Middle Ages was
1274,II.,that not merely literary forms were for ever arising and being
1275,II.,"superseded, but literary subject matter was continually undergoing a"
1276,II.,process of transformation. While in Antiquity the great epic and tragic
1277,II.,"stuffs remained well-nigh unaltered, and the stories of Valerius Flaccus"
1278,II.,and Apollonius Rhodius were merely the stories which had been current
1279,II.,"since the days of Homer, during the course of the Middle Ages every epic"
1280,II.,"cycle, and every tale belonging thereunto, was gradually adulterated,"
1281,II.,"mingled with, swamped by, some other cycle or tale; nay, rather, every"
1282,II.,"other, cycle and every other tale, the older ones trying to save their"
1283,II.,"popularity by admixture with the more recent, till at last all mythical"
1284,II.,"significance, all historical meaning, all national character, all"
1285,II.,"psychological reality, were lost in the chaotic result. And meanwhile,"
1286,II.,"in the absence of any stable language, of any durable literary fashion,"
1287,II.,"the Middle Ages were unable to give to these epic stuffs, at any one"
1288,II.,"period of their life of metamorphose, a form sufficiently artistically"
1289,II.,"valuable to secure anything beyond momentary vogue, to secure for them"
1290,II.,the immortality of the great Greek tales of adventure and warfare and
1291,II.,"love. Thus it came about that the epic cycle of Charlemagne, after"
1292,II.,"supplanting in men's minds the grand sagas of the pagan North, was"
1293,II.,itself supplanted by the Arthurian cycle; that the Frankish stories
1294,II.,absorbed the wholly discrepant elements of their more fortunate Keltic
1295,II.,"rivals; that both cycles, having lost all character through fusion and"
1296,II.,"through obliteration by time, became more meaningless generation by"
1297,II.,"generation and year by year, until when the Middle Ages had come to an"
1298,II.,"end, and the great poets of the Renaissance were ready to give this old"
1299,II.,"mediæval epic stuff a definitive and durable artistic shape, there came"
1300,II.,"to the hands of Boiardo and Ariosto, of Tasso and Spenser, only a"
1301,II.,"strange, trumpery material, muddled by jongleurs and romance writers,"
1302,II.,"and reduced to mere fairy stuff, taken seriously only by Don Quixote,"
1303,II.,and by the authors of the volumes of insane twaddle called after Amadis
1304,II.,of Gaul and all his kinsmen.
1305,II.,
1306,II.,"Such a condition of perpetual change as explains, in my belief, why the"
1307,II.,"mediæval epic subjects were wanted, can be made clear only by examples."
1308,II.,I shall therefore try to show the transformations which were undergone
1309,II.,by one or two principal mediæval epic subjects as a result of a mixture
1310,II.,with other epic cycles; of a gradual adaptation to a new state of
1311,II.,civilization; and finally of their gradual separation from all kind of
1312,II.,reality and real interests.
1313,II.,
1314,II.,"First of all, let us look at the epic cycle, which, although known to us"
1315,II.,only in poems no older than those of the trouvères and minnesingers who
1316,II.,"sang of Charlemagne and Arthur, is in reality far more ancient, and on"
1317,II.,account of its antiquity and its consequent disconnection with mediæval
1318,II.,"religious and political interests, was thrown aside even by the nations"
1319,II.,"to which it belonged, by the Scandinavians who took to writing sagas"
1320,II.,"about the wars of Charlemagne against Saracens, and by the Germans who"
1321,II.,"preferred to hear the adventures of Welsh and Briton, Launcelots and"
1322,II.,Tristrams. I am alluding to the stories connected with the family and
1323,II.,"life of the hero called Sigurd by the Scandinavians, and Siegfried by"
1324,II.,the Germans. Of these we possess a Norse version called the Volsunga
1325,II.,"Saga, magnificently done into English by Mr. William Morris; which,"
1326,II.,"although written down at the end of the twelfth century, in the very"
1327,II.,"time therefore of Chrestien de Troyes, Wolfram von Eschenbach, and"
1328,II.,"Gottfried von Strassburg, and subsequently to the presumed writing of"
1329,II.,"""The Chanson de Roland"" and the Nibelungenlied, shows us in reality the"
1330,II.,"product of a people, the distant Scandinavians of Iceland, who were five"
1331,II.,"or six hundred years behind the French, Germans, and English of the"
1332,II.,"twelfth century. In the Volsunga Saga, neither Christianity nor"
1333,II.,feudalism is yet dreamed of; and it is for this reason that I wish to
1334,II.,"compare it with the Nibelungenlied, in order to show how enormously the"
1335,II.,old epic stuff was altered by the new civilization. The whole social and
1336,II.,moral condition of the two versions is different. In the old
1337,II.,"Scandinavian civilization, where the Viking is surrounded and served by"
1338,II.,"clansmen, the feeling of blood relationship is the strongest in people's"
1339,II.,"hearts; strangely and fearfully shown in the introductory tale of Signy,"
1340,II.,"who, in order to avenge her father Volsung, killed by her husband,"
1341,II.,"murders her children by the latter, and then, altered in face by magic"
1342,II.,"arts, goes forth to the woods to her brother Sigmund, that,"
1343,II.,"un-wittingly, he may beget with her the only man fit to avenge the"
1344,II.,Volsungs. And then she sends the boy Sinfjotli to the man he has
1345,II.,"hitherto considered merely as his uncle, bidding the latter kill him if"
1346,II.,"he prove unworthy of his incestuous birth, or train him to vengeance."
1347,II.,"The three together murder the husband and legitimate children of Signy,"
1348,II.,"and set the palace on fire; which, being done, the queen, having"
1349,II.,"accomplished her duty to her kin, accomplishes that towards her husband,"
1350,II.,and calmly returns to die in the burning hall. Here (and apparently
1351,II.,again in the case of the children of Sigurd and Brynhilt) incest becomes
1352,II.,a family virtue. This being the frightful preponderance of the feeling
1353,II.,"of blood relationship, it is quite natural that the Scandinavian"
1354,II.,"Chriemhilt (called in the Volsunga Saga, Gudrun) should not resent the"
1355,II.,murder of her husband Siegfried or Sigurd by her brothers at the
1356,II.,instigation of the jealous Brynhilt (who has in a manner been Sigurd's
1357,II.,"wife before he made her over to Chriemhilt's eldest brother); and that,"
1358,II.,"so far from seeking any revenge against them, she should, when her second"
1359,II.,"husband Atli sends for her brothers in order to rob and murder them,"
1360,II.,"first vainly warn them of the plot, and then, when they have been"
1361,II.,"massacred, kill Atli and her children by him in order to avenge her"
1362,II.,"brothers. The slackening of the tribal feeling, the idea of fidelity in"
1363,II.,"love and sanctity of marriage belonging to Christianity and feudalism,"
1364,II.,rendered such a story unintelligible to the Germans of the Othos and
1365,II.,"Henrys. In the Nibelungenlied, the whole story of the massacre of the"
1366,II.,"brothers is changed. Chriemhilt never forgives the murder of Siegfried,"
1367,II.,"and it is not Etzel--Atli for the sake of plunder, but she herself for"
1368,II.,"the sake of revenge, who decoys her brothers and murders them; it is she"
1369,II.,who with her own hand cuts off the head of Gunther to expiate his murder
1370,II.,"of Siegfried. To our feelings, more akin to those of the feudal"
1371,II.,Christians of Franconia than to those of the tribal Scandinavians of the
1372,II.,"Edda, the second version is far more intelligible and interesting--the"
1373,II.,"story of this once gentle and loving Chriemhilt, turned by the murder of"
1374,II.,"her beloved into a fury, and plotting to avenge his death by the death"
1375,II.,"of all his kinsfolk, must be much grander and more pathetic than the"
1376,II.,"story of this strange Gudrun, who sits down patiently beneath the injury"
1377,II.,"done to her by her brothers, but savagely avenges them on her new"
1378,II.,"husband, and her own and his innocent children; to us this persistence"
1379,II.,"of tribal feeling, destroying all indignation and love, is merely"
1380,II.,"unnatural, confusing, and repulsive. But this alteration for the better"
1381,II.,in one of the incidents of the tale is a mere fluke; and the whole main
1382,II.,plot of the originally central figures are completely obliterated by the
1383,II.,"new state of civilization, and rendered merely trivial and grotesque. In"
1384,II.,"the Volsunga Saga Sigurd, overcome by enchantments, has forgotten his"
1385,II.,"wife (or mistress, a vague mythical relationship); and, with all sense"
1386,II.,"of the past obliterated, has made her over to the brother of his new"
1387,II.,wife Gudrun; and Brynhilt kills her faithless love to dissolve the
1388,II.,second marriage and be reunited with him in death. In the Nibelungenlied
1389,II.,"Siegfried, although the flower of knighthood, conquers by foul play the"
1390,II.,"Amazon Brunhilt to reward Gunther for the hand of his sister; nay, in a"
1391,II.,comic and loathsome scene he forces her into the embraces of the craven
1392,II.,"Gunther; and then he gets killed by Brunhilt's machinations; when, after"
1393,II.,"most unqueenly bickerings, the proud Amazon is brutally told by"
1394,II.,Siegfried's wife of the dirty trick which has given her to Gunther.
1395,II.,"After this, it is impossible to realize, when Siegfried is murdered and"
1396,II.,"all our sympathies called on to his side, the utterly out-of-character,"
1397,II.,blackguardly behaviour which has brought the hero to his death.
1398,II.,Similarly the conception of the character and position of Brynhilt is
1399,II.,entirely disfigured and rendered inane in the Nibelungenlied: of that
1400,II.,"superb demi-goddess of the Scandinavians, burnt on the pyre with her"
1401,II.,"falcons and dogs and horses and slaves, by the side of the demi-god"
1402,II.,"Sigurd, whom she has loved and killed, lest the door of Valhalla,"
1403,II.,"swinging after him, should shut her out from his presence; of her there"
1404,II.,remains in the German mediæval poem only a virago (more like the
1405,II.,giantesses of the Amadis romances) enraged at having been defeated and
1406,II.,"grotesquely and grossly pummelled into wedlock by a man not her husband,"
1407,II.,and then slanged like a fishwife by her envious sister-in-law.
1408,II.,
1409,II.,"The old, consistent, grandly tragic tale of the mysterious incests and"
1410,II.,"revenges of a race of demi-gods has lost its sense, its point in the"
1411,II.,attempt to arrange it to suit Christian and feudal ideas. The really
1412,II.,fine portions of the Nibelungenlied are exactly those which have no real
1413,II.,"connection with the original story, gratuitous additions by mediæval"
1414,II.,poets. The delicately indicated falling in love of Siegfried and
1415,II.,"Chriemhilt, the struggles of Markgraf Rüdger between obedience to his"
1416,II.,"feudal superior and fidelity towards his friends and guests; and, above"
1417,II.,"all, the canto of the death of Siegfried. This last is different,"
1418,II.,"intensely different, from the rugged and dreary monotony of the rest;"
1419,II.,"this most poetical, almost Spenserian or Ariostesque realization of the"
1420,II.,scene; this beautiful picture (though worked with the needle of the
1421,II.,"arras-worker rather than with pencil or brush) of the wood, the hunt,"
1422,II.,"the solitary fountain in the Odenwald, where, with his spear leaned"
1423,II.,"against the lime-tree, Siegfried was struck down into the clover and"
1424,II.,"flowers, and writhed with Hagen's steel through his back. This canto is"
1425,II.,"certainly interpolated by some first-rate poet, at least a Gottfried or"
1426,II.,"a Walther, to whom that passage of the savage old droning song of death"
1427,II.,had suggested a piece of new art; it is like the fragments of
1428,II.,exquisitely chiselled leafage and figures which you sometimes find
1429,II.,encrusted--by whom? wherefore?--quite isolated in the midst of the rough
1430,II.,and lichen-stained stones of some rude Lombard church. All the rest of
1431,II.,the Nibelungenlied gives an impression of effeteness; there is no
1432,II.,definiteness of idea such as that of the Volsunga Saga; the battles are
1433,II.,"mere vague slaughter, no action, no realized movement, or (excepting"
1434,II.,Rüdger) no realized motive of conduct. Shape and colour would seem to
1435,II.,have been obliterated by repetition and alteration. Yet even these
1436,II.,alterations could not make the tale of Siegfried survive among the
1437,II.,"Germans of the Middle Ages; nay, the more the alterations the less the"
1438,II.,interest; the want of consistency and colour due to rearrangement merely
1439,II.,"accelerated the throwing aside of a subject which, dating from pagan and"
1440,II.,"tribal times, had become repugnant to the new generations. All the"
1441,II.,mutilations in the world could not make the old Scandinavian tales of
1442,II.,"betrayed trust, of revenge and triumphant bloodshed, at all sympathetic"
1443,II.,to men whose religious and social ideals were those of forgiveness and
1444,II.,fidelity; even stripped of its incestuous mysteries and of its fearful
1445,II.,"tribal love, the tale of Sigurd and Brynhilt, reduced to the tale of"
1446,II.,"Chriemhilt's revenge, was unpalatable: no more attempts were made at"
1447,II.,"re-writing it, and the poems of Walther, of Gottfried, of Wolfram, of"
1448,II.,"Ulrich, and of Tannhäuser, full as they are of references to stories of"
1449,II.,"the Carolingian and Arthurian cycles, nay, to Antique and Oriental"
1450,II.,"tales, contain no allusion to the personages of the Nibelungenlied. The"
1451,II.,old epic of the Gothic races had been pushed aside by the triumphant
1452,II.,epic of the obscure and conquered Kelts.
1453,II.,
1454,II.,There are few phenomena in the history of ideas and forms more singular
1455,II.,than that of the sudden conquest of the poetry of dominant or distant
1456,II.,"nations by the poetic subjects of a comparatively small race, sheared of"
1457,II.,"all political importance, restricted to a trifling territory, and"
1458,II.,well-nigh deprived of their language; and of this there can be found no
1459,II.,more striking example than the sudden ousting of the Carolingian epic by
1460,II.,the cycle of Arthur.
1461,II.,
1462,II.,"The Kelts of Britain and Ireland possessed an epic cycle of their own,"
1463,II.,which came to notice only when they were dispossessed of their last
1464,II.,"strongholds by Saxons and Normans, and which immediately spread with"
1465,II.,astounding rapidity all over Europe. The vanquished race became
1466,II.,"fashionable; themselves, their art and their poetry, began to be sought"
1467,II.,for as a precious and war-enhanced loot. The heroic tales of the Kelts
1468,II.,"were transcribed in Welsh, and translated into Latin, by order of the"
1469,II.,"Norman and Angevine kings, glad, it would seem, to oppose the Old Briton"
1470,II.,to the Saxon element. The Keltic songs were carried all over France by
1471,II.,"Breton bards, to whose music and rhymes, with only a general idea of the"
1472,II.,"subjects, the neo-Latin-speaking Franks listened with the sort of stolid"
1473,II.,satisfaction with which English or Germans of a hundred years ago
1474,II.,listened to Italians singing Metastasio's verses. But soon the songs and
1475,II.,"tales were translated; and French poets imitated in their language,"
1476,II.,"northern and southern, the graceful metres of the Keltic lays, and"
1477,II.,"altered and arranged their subjects. So that, in a very short time,"
1478,II.,"France, and through it Germany, was inundated with Keltic stories. This"
1479,II.,"triumph of the vanquished race was not without reason. The Kelts, early"
1480,II.,"civilized by Rome and Christianity, had a set of stories and a set of"
1481,II.,"heroes extremely in accordance with mediæval ideas, and requiring but"
1482,II.,very little alteration. The considerable age of their civilization had
1483,II.,long obliterated all traces of pagan and tribal feeling in their tales.
1484,II.,"Their heroes, originally, like those of all other people, divinities"
1485,II.,"intimately connected with natural phenomena, had long lost all cosmic"
1486,II.,"characteristics, long ceased to be gods, and, manipulated by the fancy"
1487,II.,"of a race whose greatness was quite a thing of the past, had become a"
1488,II.,"sort of golden age ideals--the men of a distant period of glory, which"
1489,II.,"was adorned with every kind of perfection, till it became as unreal as"
1490,II.,"fairyland. Fairyland, in good sooth, was this country of the Keltic"
1491,II.,tales; and there is a sort of symbolical significance in the fact of its
1492,II.,"lawgiver Merlin, and its emperor Arthur, being both of them not dead,"
1493,II.,"like Sigurd, like Dietrich, like Charlemagne and Roland, but lying in"
1494,II.,enchanted sleep. Long inaction and the day-dreaming of idleness had
1495,II.,refined and idealized the heroes of this Keltic race--a race of
1496,II.,"brilliant fancy and almost southern mobility, and softened for a long"
1497,II.,time by contact with Roman colonists and Christian priests. They were
1498,II.,"not the brutal combatants of an active fighting age, like the heroes of"
1499,II.,the Edda and of the Carolingian cycles; nor had they any particular
1500,II.,"military work to do, belonging as they did to a people huddled away into"
1501,II.,inactivity. Their sole occupation was to extend abroad that ideal
1502,II.,happiness which reigned in the ideal court of Arthur; to go forth on the
1503,II.,loose and see what ill-conditioned folk there might yet be who required
1504,II.,"being subdued or taught manners in the happy kingdom, which the poor"
1505,II.,insignificant Kelts connected with some princelet of theirs who
1506,II.,centuries before may have momentarily repelled the pagan Saxons. Hence
1507,II.,"in the Keltic stories, such as they exist in the versions previous to"
1508,II.,"the conquest by the Norman kings, and previous also to any"
1509,II.,"communications with other peoples, the distinct beginning of what was"
1510,II.,"later to be called knight-errantry; of heroes, creations of an inactive"
1511,II.,"nation, having no special military duties, going forth to do what good"
1512,II.,"they may at random, unforced by any necessity, and following a mere"
1513,II.,æsthetico-romantic plan of perfecting themselves by deeds of valour to
1514,II.,"become more worthy of their God, their King, and their Lady: religion,"
1515,II.,"loyalty, and love, all three of them mere æsthetic abstractions,"
1516,II.,"becoming the goal of an essentially æsthetic, unpractical system of"
1517,II.,"self-improvement, such as was utterly incompatible with any real and"
1518,II.,"serious business in life. Idle poetic fancies of an inert people, the"
1519,II.,Knights of the Round Table have no mission save that of being
1520,II.,"poetically perfect. Such was the spirit of Keltic poetry; and, as it"
1521,II.,"happened, this spirit satisfied the imaginative wants of mediæval"
1522,II.,society just at the moment when political events diffused in other
1523,II.,countries the knowledge of the Arthurian legends. The old Teutonic tales
1524,II.,"of Sigurd, Gudrun, and Dietrich, had long ceased to appeal, in their"
1525,II.,"mutilated and obliterated condition, to a society to whom tribal feeling"
1526,II.,"and pagan heroism were odious, and whose religion distinctly reproved"
1527,II.,revenge. These semi-mythological tales had been replaced by another
1528,II.,"cycle: the purely realistic epic, which had arisen during the struggles"
1529,II.,between the Christian west against the pagan north-east and the
1530,II.,"Mohammedan south, and which, originating in the short battle-songs"
1531,II.,narrating the exploits of the predecessors and help-mates of
1532,II.,"Charlemagne, had constituted itself into large narratives of which the"
1533,II.,"""Song of Roland"" represents artistic culmination. These narratives of"
1534,II.,"mere military exploits, of the battles of a strong feudal aristocracy"
1535,II.,"animated by feudal loyalty and half-religious, half-patriotic fury"
1536,II.,"against invading heathenness, had perfectly satisfied the men of the"
1537,II.,"earliest Middle Ages, of the times when feudalism was being established"
1538,II.,and the church being reformed; when the strong military princelets of
1539,II.,the North were embarking with their barons to conquer new kingdoms in
1540,II.,England and in Italy and Greece; when the whole of feudal Europe hurled
1541,II.,itself against Asia in the first Crusades. But the condition of things
1542,II.,soon altered: the feudal hierarchy was broken up into a number of
1543,II.,"semi-independent little kingdoms or principalities, struggling, with the"
1544,II.,"assistance of industrial and mercantile classes, to become absolute"
1545,II.,monarchies; princes who had been mere generals became stay-at-home
1546,II.,"diplomatists, studious of taxation and intrigue, surrounded no longer by"
1547,II.,"armed vassals, but by an essentially urban court, in constant"
1548,II.,"communication with the money-making burghers. Religion, also, instead of"
1549,II.,"being a matter of fighting with infidel invaders, turned to fantastic"
1550,II.,"sectarianism and emotional mysticism. With the sense of futility, of"
1551,II.,"disappointment, attendant on the later Crusades, came also a habit of"
1552,II.,"roaming in strange countries, of isolated adventure in search of wealth"
1553,II.,"or information, a love of the distant, the half-understood, the"
1554,II.,equivocal; perhaps even a hankering after a mysterious compromise
1555,II.,"between the religion of Europe and the religions of the East, such as"
1556,II.,appears to have existed among the Templars and other Franks settled in
1557,II.,Asia.
1558,II.,
1559,II.,"There was, throughout feudal society, a sort of enervated languor, a"
1560,II.,"morbid longing for something new, now that the old had ceased to be"
1561,II.,possible or had proved futile; after the great excitement of the
1562,II.,"Crusades it was impossible to be either sedately idle or quietly active,"
1563,II.,even as it is with all of us during the days of weariness and
1564,II.,restlessness after some long journey. To such a society the strongly
1565,II.,realistic Carolingian epic had ceased to appeal: the tales of the Welsh
1566,II.,"and Breton bards, repeated by trouvère and jongleur, troubadour and"
1567,II.,"minnesinger, came as a revelation. The fatigued, disappointed, morbid,"
1568,II.,imaginative society of the later Crusades recognized in this fairyland
1569,II.,"epic of a long refined, long idle, nay, effete race, the realization of"
1570,II.,"their own ideal: of activity unhampered by aim or organization, of"
1571,II.,"sentiment and emotion and action quite useless and unnecessary, purely"
1572,II.,"subservient to imaginative gratification. These Arthurs, Launcelots,"
1573,II.,"Tristrams, Kays, and Gawains, fantastic phantoms, were also far more"
1574,II.,"artistically malleable than the iron Rolands, Olivers, and Renauds of"
1575,II.,earlier days; that unknown kingdom of Britain could much more easily be
1576,II.,"made the impossible ideal, in longing for which squeamish and lazy minds"
1577,II.,"might refuse all coarser reality. Moreover, those who listened to the"
1578,II.,tales of chivalry were different from those who had listened to the
1579,II.,"Carolingian stories; and, therefore, required something different. They"
1580,II.,"were courtiers, and one half of them were women. Now the Carolingian"
1581,II.,"tales, originally battle-songs, sung in camps and castles to mere"
1582,II.,"soldiers, had at first possessed no female characters at all; and when"
1583,II.,"gradually they were introduced, it was in the coarsest barrack or"
1584,II.,"tap-room style. The Keltic tales, on the contrary, whether from national"
1585,II.,"tradition, or rather from longer familiarity with Christian culture and"
1586,II.,"greater idleness of life, naturally made women and women's love the"
1587,II.,goal of a great many adventures which an effete nation could no longer
1588,II.,ascribe to patriotic movements. But this was not all. The religious
1589,II.,"feeling of the day was extremely inclined to mysticism, in which"
1590,II.,"æsthetic, erotic, and all kinds of morbid and ill-defined tendencies"
1591,II.,"were united, which was more than anything else tinged with a"
1592,II.,"semi-Asiatic quietism, a longing for the passive ecstasy of Nirvâna."
1593,II.,This religious side of mediæval life was also gratified by the Arthurian
1594,II.,"romances. Oddly enough, there existed an old Welsh or Breton tale about"
1595,II.,"the boy Peredur, who from a complete simpleton became the prince of"
1596,II.,"chivalry, and his many adventures connected with a certain mysterious"
1597,II.,"blood-dripping lance, and a still more mysterious basin or _grail_ (an"
1598,II.,allusion to which is said by M. de la Villemarqué to be contained in the
1599,II.,"originally Keltic name of Percival), which possessed magic properties"
1600,II.,"akin to those of the purse of Fortunatus, or the pipkin in the story of"
1601,II.,"""Little pot, boil!"" The story, whose original mythical meaning had been"
1602,II.,"lost in the several centuries of Christianity, was very decayed and"
1603,II.,obscure; and the fact of the blood on the lance being that of a murdered
1604,II.,"kinsman of Peredur, and of the basin containing the head of the same"
1605,II.,"person cut off by Gloucester witches, was evidently insufficient to"
1606,II.,account for all the mystery with which these objects were surrounded.
1607,II.,"The French poets of the Middle Ages, strongly imbued with Oriental"
1608,II.,"legends brought back by the Crusaders, saw at a glance the meaning of"
1609,II.,the whole story: the lance was the lance with which Longinus had pierced
1610,II.,"the Saviour's side; the Grail was the cup which had received His blood,"
1611,II.,"nay, it was the cup of the Last Supper. A tale about the preservation of"
1612,II.,"these precious relics by Joseph of Arimathæa, was immediately connected"
1613,II.,therewith; a theory was set up (doubtless with the aid of quite
1614,II.,"unchristian, Oriental legends) of a kind of kingdom of the keepers of"
1615,II.,"the Grail, of a vague half-material, half-spiritual state of bliss"
1616,II.,"connected with the service of the Grail, which fed its knights (and here"
1617,II.,"the Templars and their semi-oriental mysteries, for which they were"
1618,II.,"later so frightfully misused, certainly come into play) with food which"
1619,II.,"is at once of the body and of the soul. Thus the Keltic Peredur, bent"
1620,II.,"upon massacring the Gloucester witches to avenge his uncle, was turned"
1621,II.,"into a saintly knight, seeking throughout a more and more perfect life"
1622,II.,"for the kingdom of the Grail: the Perceval of Chrestien de Troyes, the"
1623,II.,"Parzifal of Wolfram von Eschenbach, whom later romance writers (wishing"
1624,II.,to connect everything more closely with Arthur's court) replaced by the
1625,II.,"Sir Galahad of the ""Morte d'Arthur,"" while the guest of the Grail became"
1626,II.,"a sort of general mission of several knights, a sort of spiritual"
1627,II.,"crusade to whose successful champions Percival, Bors, and Galahad, the"
1628,II.,Middle Ages did not hesitate to add the arch-adulterer Launcelot.
1629,II.,
1630,II.,"Thus did the Arthurian tales answer the requirements of the languid,"
1631,II.,"dreamy, courtly, lady-serving and religiously mystic sons and grandsons"
1632,II.,of those earlier Crusaders whose aspirations had been expressed by the
1633,II.,rough and solemn heroes of Carolingian tales. The Carolingian tales were
1634,II.,"thrown aside, or were kept by the noble mediæval poets only on condition"
1635,II.,of their original meaning being completely defaced by wholesale
1636,II.,admixture of the manners and adventures belonging to the Arthurian
1637,II.,cycles. The paladins were forced to disport themselves in the same
1638,II.,fairyland as the Knights of the Round Table; and many mediæval poems the
1639,II.,"heroes of which, like Ogier of Denmark and Huon of Bordeaux, already"
1640,II.,"existed in the Carolingian tales, are in reality, with their romantic"
1641,II.,"loves, their useless adventures, their Morgana's castles and Oberon's"
1642,II.,"horns, offshoots of the Keltic stories, which were as rich in every kind"
1643,II.,"of supernatural (being, in fact, pagan myths turned into fairy tales) as"
1644,II.,"the genuine Carolingian subjects, whose origin was entirely historical,"
1645,II.,were completely devoid of such things. Arthur and his ladies and
1646,II.,"knights: Guenevere, Elaine, Enid, Yseult, Launcelot, Geraint, Kay,"
1647,II.,"Gawain, Tristram, and Percival-Galahad, were the real heroes and"
1648,II.,heroines of the courtly nobles and the courtly poets of this second
1649,II.,"phase of mediæval life. The Teuton Charlemagne, Roland and Oliver were"
1650,II.,as completely forgotten of the poets who met in that memorable combat of
1651,II.,"the Wartburg, as were the Teuton Sigurd and Dietrich. And if the"
1652,II.,"Carolingian cycle survived, however much altered, I think it must have"
1653,II.,been thanks to the burghers and artizans of the Netherlands and of
1654,II.,"Provence, to whom the bluff, matter-of-fact heroism, the simple, gross,"
1655,II.,"but not illegitimate amours of Carolingian heroes, were more"
1656,II.,"satisfactory than any mystic quest of the Grail, any refined adultery of"
1657,II.,Guenevere or Yseult.
1658,II.,
1659,II.,But the inevitable fate of all mediæval epics awaited this triumphant
1660,II.,Arthurian cycle: the fate of being obliterated by passing from one
1661,II.,"nation and civilization to another, long before the existence of any"
1662,II.,poetic art adequate to its treatment. Of this I will take as an example
1663,II.,one of the mediæval poems which has the greatest reputation the
1664,II.,"masterpiece (according to most critics, with whom I find it difficult,"
1665,II.,"in the presence of a poet like Gottfried von Strassburg, to agree) of"
1666,II.,probably the most really poetical and earnest school of poetry which the
1667,II.,"pre-Dantesque Middle Ages possessed--the ""Parzifal"" of Wolfram von"
1668,II.,Eschenbach.
1669,II.,
1670,II.,"The paramount impression (I cannot say the strongest, for strong"
1671,II.,impressions are incompatible with such work as this) left by the
1672,II.,"masterpiece of Wolfram von Eschenbach, is that of the most astonishing"
1673,II.,"vagueness, fluidity, haziness, vaporousness. In reading it one looks"
1674,II.,"back to that rudely hewn and extremely obliterated Nibelungenlied, as to"
1675,II.,"something quite astonishingly clear, detailed and strongly marked as to"
1676,II.,"something distinctly artistic. Indeed by the side of ""Parzifal"""
1677,II.,"everything seems artistic; Hartmann von Aue reads like Chaucer,"
1678,II.,"""Aucassin et Nicolette"" is as living as ""Cymbeline,"" ""Chevy Chase"" seems"
1679,II.,"as good as the battles of Homer. It is not a narrative, but a vague"
1680,II.,"mooning; a knight illiterate, not merely like his fellow minnesingers,"
1681,II.,"in the way of reading and writing, but in the sense of complete absence"
1682,II.,"of all habit of literary form; extremely noble and pure of mind, chaste,"
1683,II.,"gentle, with a funny, puzzled sense of humour, reminding one distantly"
1684,II.,"of Jean Paul in his drowsy moments; a hanger-on of courts, but perfectly"
1685,II.,"simple-hearted and childlike; very poor and easily pleased: such is, for"
1686,II.,"good and for bad, Herr Wolfram von Eschenbach, the only real personality"
1687,II.,"in his poem. And he narrates, in a mooning, digressive, good-natured,"
1688,II.,"drowsy tone, with only a rare awaking of interest, a story which he has"
1689,II.,"heard from some one else, and that some one else from a series of other"
1690,II.,"some one elses (Chrestien de Troyes, a legendary Provençal Chiot or"
1691,II.,"Guyot, perhaps even the original Welsh bard); all muddled, monotonous,"
1692,II.,"and droning; events and persons ill-defined, without any sense of the"
1693,II.,"relative importance of anything, without clear perception of what it is"
1694,II.,"all about, or at least without the power of keeping the matter straight"
1695,II.,"before the reader. A story, in point of fact, which is no story at all,"
1696,II.,but a mere series of rambling adventures (adventures which are scarcely
1697,II.,"adventures, having no point or plot) of various people with not much"
1698,II.,"connection and no individuality--Gachmuret, Parzifal, Gawain,"
1699,II.,"Loherangrein, Anfortas, Feirefis--pale ghosts of beings, moving in a"
1700,II.,"country of Kennaqwhere, Aquitaine, Anjou, Brittany, Wales, Spain, and"
1701,II.,heaven knows what wondrous Oriental places; a misty country with woods
1702,II.,and towns and castles which are infinitely far apart and yet quite near
1703,II.,each other; which seem to sail about like cloud castles round the only
1704,II.,"solid place in the book, Plimizöl, where Arthur's court, with round"
1705,II.,"table constantly spread, is for ever established. A no place, nowhere;"
1706,II.,yet full of details; minute inventories of the splendid furniture of
1707,II.,castles (castles where? how reached?); infinitely inferior in this
1708,II.,"matter even to the Nibelungenlied, where you are made to feel so vividly"
1709,II.,"(one of the few modern and therefore clear things therein) the long,"
1710,II.,"dreary road from Worms to Bechlarn, and thence to Etzelburg, though of"
1711,II.,none of them is there anything beyond a name. For the Nibelungen story
1712,II.,"had been localized in what to narrator and audience was a reality, the"
1713,II.,"country in which themselves lived, where themselves might seek out the"
1714,II.,"abbey in which Siegfried was buried, the well in the Odenwald near which"
1715,II.,he was stabbed; where they knew from merchant and pilgrim the road taken
1716,II.,"by the Nibelungs from Santen to Worms, by the Burgundians from Worms to"
1717,II.,"Hungary. But here in ""Parzifal"" we are in a mere vague world of"
1718,II.,"anywhere, the world of Keltic and Oriental romance become mere cloudland"
1719,II.,to the Thuringian knight. And similarly have the heroes of other
1720,II.,"nations, the Arthurs, Gawains, Gachmurets, of Wales and Anjou, become"
1721,II.,"mere vague names; they have become liquified, lost all shape and local"
1722,II.,"habitation. They are mere names, these ladies and knights of Herr"
1723,II.,"Wolfram, names with fair pink and white faces, names magnificently"
1724,II.,draped in bejewelled Oriental stuffs and embossed armour; they have no
1725,II.,"home, no work, nothing to do. This is the most remarkable characteristic"
1726,II.,"of ""Parzifal,"" and what makes it so typical of the process of growing"
1727,II.,"inane through overmuch alteration, which prevented the mediæval epics"
1728,II.,ever turning into an Iliad or an Odyssey; this that it is essentially
1729,II.,idle and all about nothing. The feudal relations strongly marked in the
1730,II.,German Nibelungenlied have melted away like the distinctions of race:
1731,II.,"every knight is independent, not a vassal nor a captain, a Volker or"
1732,II.,"Hagen, or Roland or Renaud followed by his men; but an isolated"
1733,II.,"individual, without even a squire, wandering about alone through this"
1734,II.,"hazy land of nowhere. Knight-errantry, in the time of the great Guelph"
1735,II.,"and Ghibelline struggles, every bit as ideal as that of Spenser or"
1736,II.,Cervantes; and with the difference that Sir Calidore and Sir Artegal
1737,II.,"have an appointed task, some Blatant Beast or other nuisance to"
1738,II.,overcome; and that Don Quixote has the general rescuing of all the
1739,II.,"oppressed Princesse Micomiconas, and the destruction of all windmills,"
1740,II.,"and the capturing of all helmets of Mambrino, and the establishing all"
1741,II.,over the world of the worship of Dulcinea. But these knights of Wolfram
1742,II.,von Eschenbach have no more this mission than they have the
1743,II.,"politico-military missions, missions of a Rüdger or a Roland. They are"
1744,II.,"all riding about at random, without any particular pagans, necromancers,"
1745,II.,"or dragons to pursue. The very service of the Holy Grail, which is the"
1746,II.,"main interest of the poem, consists in nothing apparently except living"
1747,II.,"virtuously at the Castle of Montselväsche, and virtuously eating and"
1748,II.,drinking the victuals provided miraculously. To be admitted to this
1749,II.,"service, no initiation, no mission, nothing preliminary seems required."
1750,II.,"Parzifal himself merely wanders about vaguely, without doing any"
1751,II.,specified thing. The fact is that in this poem all has become purely
1752,II.,ideal; ideal to the point of utter vacuity: there is no connection with
1753,II.,any human business. Of all the heroes and heroines we hear that they are
1754,II.,"perfectly chaste, truthful, upright; and they are never put into any"
1755,II.,situation to test these qualities: they are never placed in the way of
1756,II.,"temptation, never made to fight with evil, or to decide between it and"
1757,II.,good. The very religion of the Holy Grail consists in doing nothing: not
1758,II.,"a word about relieving the poor or oppressed, of tending the sick, of"
1759,II.,"delivering the Holy Sepulchre, of defending that great injured One,"
1760,II.,Christ. To be Grail Knight or even Grail King means to be exactly the
1761,II.,same as before. Where in this vague dreamland of passive purity and
1762,II.,"heroism, of untempted chastity and untried honour, where are the earthly"
1763,II.,"trials of Tristram, of Guenevere, of Rüdger, of Renaud? Where the moral"
1764,II.,"struggles of the Middle Ages? Where is Godfrey, or Francis, or Dominick?"
1765,II.,"Nowhere. All has disappeared, melted away; Christianity and Paganism"
1766,II.,"themselves have melted away or into each other, as in the easy meeting"
1767,II.,"of the Pagan Feirefis and the Christian Parzifal, and in the double"
1768,II.,marriage of Gachmuret with the Indian Belakane and the Welsh Herzeloid;
1769,II.,there remains only a kind of Buddhistic Nirvâna of vague passive
1770,II.,"perfection, but without any renunciation; and in a world devoid of evil"
1771,II.,"and full of excellent brocade and armour and eatables, and lovely"
1772,II.,"maidens who dress and undress you, and chastely kiss you on the mouth; a"
1773,II.,"world without desire, aspiration, or combat, vacantly happy and"
1774,II.,"virtuous. A world purely ideal, divorced from all reality, unsubstantial"
1775,II.,"like the kingdom of Gloriana, but, unlike Spenser's, quite unshadowed by"
1776,II.,"any puritan sadness, by any sense of evil, untroubled by allegorical"
1777,II.,"vices; cheerful, serene, filled with flowers and song of birds, but as"
1778,II.,"unreal as the illuminated arabesques of a missal. In truth, perhaps more"
1779,II.,"to be compared with an eighteenth century pastoral, an ideal created"
1780,II.,almost in opposition to reality; a dream of passiveness and liberty (as
1781,II.,"of light leaves blown about) as the ideal of the fiercely troubled,"
1782,II.,"struggling, tightly fettered feudal world. The ideal, perhaps, of only"
1783,II.,"one moment, scarcely of a whole civilization; or rather (how express my"
1784,II.,"feeling?) an accidental combination of an instant, as of spectre vapour"
1785,II.,"arisen from the mixture of Kelt and Teuton, of Frank and Moslem. Is it"
1786,II.,"Christian, Pagan, Mohammedan? None of all these. A simple-looking"
1787,II.,"vaporous chaos of incongruous, but not conflicting, elements: a poem of"
1788,II.,"virtue without object, of knighthood without work, of religion without"
1789,II.,"belief; in this like its central interest, the Grail: a mystery, a cup,"
1790,II.,"a stone; a thing which heals, feeds, speaks; animate or inanimate? Stone"
1791,II.,of the Caaba or chalice of the Sacrament? Merely a mysterious holy of
1792,II.,"holies and good of goods, which does everything and nothings means"
1793,II.,nothing and requires nothing--is nothing.
1794,II.,
1795,II.,
1796,II.,
1797,II.,
1798,III.,III.
1799,III.,
1800,III.,
1801,III.,"Thus was obliterated, in all its national and traditional meaning, the"
1802,III.,heroic cycle of Arthur; and by the same process of slow adaptation to
1803,III.,new intellectual requirements which had completely wiped out of men's
1804,III.,"memory the heroic tales of Siegfried, which had entirely altered the"
1805,III.,originally realistic character of the epic of Charlemagne. But unreal
1806,III.,"and ideal as had become the tales of the Round Table, and disconnected"
1807,III.,"with any national tradition, the time came when even these were not"
1808,III.,sufficiently independent of reality to satisfy the capricious
1809,III.,imagination of the later Middle Ages. At the end of the fourteenth
1810,III.,"century was written, most probably in Portuguese by Vasco de Lobeira,"
1811,III.,"the tale of ""Amadis de Gaula,"" which was followed by some forty or fifty"
1812,III.,"similar books telling the adventures of all the brothers, nephews,"
1813,III.,"sons, grandsons sons, and great-grandsons, an infinite succession, of"
1814,III.,"the original Amadis; which, translated into all languages and presently"
1815,III.,"multiplied by the press, seem to have usurped the place of the Arthurian"
1816,III.,stories in feudal countries until well-nigh the middle of the sixteenth
1817,III.,"century; and which were succeeded by no more stories of heroes, but by"
1818,III.,"the realistic comic novels of the type of ""Lazarillo de Tormes,"" and the"
1819,III.,"buffoon philosophic extravaganzas of ""Gargantua."" Further indeed it was"
1820,III.,impossible to go than did mediæval idealism in the Amadises. Compared
1821,III.,with them the most fairy-tale-like Arthurian stories are perfect
1822,III.,historical documents. There remains no longer any connection whatsoever
1823,III.,"with reality, historical or geographical: the whole world seems to have"
1824,III.,"been expeditiously emptied of all its contents, to make room for"
1825,III.,"kingdoms of Gaul, of Rome, of the Firm Island, of Sobradisa, etc., which"
1826,III.,are less like the Land West of the Moon and East of the Sun than they
1827,III.,"are like Sancho Panza's island. All real mankind, past, present, and"
1828,III.,"future, has similarly been swept away and replaced by a miraculous race"
1829,III.,"of Amadises, Lisvarts, Galaors, Gradasilias, Orianas, Pintiquinestras,"
1830,III.,"Fradalons, and so forth, who flit across our vision, in company with the"
1831,III.,"indispensable necromancers, fairies, dwarfs, giants, and duennas, like"
1832,III.,"some huge ballet: things without character, passions, pathos; knights"
1833,III.,"who are never wounded or killed, princesses who always end with"
1834,III.,"marrying the right man, enchanters whose heads are always chopped off,"
1835,III.,"foundlings who are always reinstated in their kingdom, inane paper"
1836,III.,"puppets bespangled with impossible sentiment, tinsel and rags which are"
1837,III.,driven about like chaff by the wind-puffs of romance. The advent of the
1838,III.,"Amadises is the coming of the Kingdom of Nonsense, the sign that the"
1839,III.,"last days of chivalric romance have come; a little more, and the"
1840,III.,"Licentiate Alonzo Perez will take his seat in Don Quixote's library, and"
1841,III.,Nicholas the Barber light his faggots in the yard.
1842,III.,
1843,III.,"But, as if in compensation of the usurpation of which they had been the"
1844,III.,"victims, the Carolingian tales, pushed out of the way by the Arthurian"
1845,III.,"cycle, were not destined to perish. Thrown aside with contempt by the"
1846,III.,"upper classes, engrossed with the Round Table and the Holy Grail, the"
1847,III.,"tales of Charlemagne and his paladins, largely adulterated with"
1848,III.,"Arthurian elements, were apparently cherished by a lower class of"
1849,III.,"society: burgesses, artizans, and such-like, for whom that Arthurian"
1850,III.,world was far too etherial and too delicately immoral; and to this
1851,III.,circumstance is due the fact that the humiliated Carolingian tales
1852,III.,eventually received an artistic embodiment which was not given to the
1853,III.,Arthurian stories. While troubadours and minnesingers were busy with the
1854,III.,"court of Arthur, and grave Latinists like Rusticiano of Pisa wrote of"
1855,III.,Launcelot and Guenevere; the Carolingian epics seem to have been mainly
1856,III.,"sung about by illiterate jongleurs, and to have busied the pens of"
1857,III.,prose hackwriters for the benefit of townsfolk. The free towns of the
1858,III.,Netherlands and of Germany appear to have been full of this
1859,III.,unfashionable literature: the Carolingian cycle had become democratic.
1860,III.,"And, inasmuch as it was literature no longer for knights and courtiers,"
1861,III.,"but for artizans and shopkeepers, it went, of course, to the"
1862,III.,pre-eminently democratic country of the Middle Ages--Italy. This was at
1863,III.,"a time when Italian was not yet a recognized language, and when the men"
1864,III.,"and women who talked in Tuscan, Lombard, or Venetian dialects, wrote in"
1865,III.,Latin and in French; and while Francesca and Paolo read the story of
1866,III.,"Launcelot most probably in good mediæval _langue d'oil_, as befitted"
1867,III.,"people of high birth; the jongleurs, who collected crowds so large as to"
1868,III.,bar the streets and require the interference of the Bolognese
1869,III.,"magistrates, sang of Roland and Oliver in a sort of _lingua Franca_ of"
1870,III.,French Lombard. French jongleurs singing in impossible French-Italian;
1871,III.,Italian jongleurs singing in impossible French; Paduan penny-a-liners
1872,III.,"writing Carolingian cyclical novels in French, not of Paris, assuredly,"
1873,III.,but of Padua--a comical and most hideous jabber of hybrid
1874,III.,languages--this was how the Carolingian stories became popular in Italy.
1875,III.,"Meanwhile, the day came when the romantic Arthurian tales had to"
1876,III.,"dislodge in Italy before the invasion of the classic epic. Troy, Rome,"
1877,III.,and Thebes had replaced Tintagil and Cærleon in the interest of the
1878,III.,cultured classes long before the beginning of the fifteenth century;
1879,III.,"when Poggio, in the very midst of the classic revival, still told of the"
1880,III.,comically engrossed audience which surrounded the vagabonds singing of
1881,III.,"Orlando and Rinaldo. The effete Arthurian cycle, superseded in Spain and"
1882,III.,"France by the Amadis romances, was speedily forgotten in Italy; but the"
1883,III.,Carolingian stories remained; and when Italian poetry arose once more
1884,III.,"after the long interregnum between Petrarch and Lorenzo dei Medici, and"
1885,III.,"looked about for subjects, it laid its hand upon them. But when, in the"
1886,III.,"second half of the fifteenth century, those old tales of Charlemagne"
1887,III.,"received, after so many centuries of alterations and ephemeral"
1888,III.,"embodiments, that artistic form which the Middle Ages had been unable to"
1889,III.,"give them, the stories themselves, and the way in which they were"
1890,III.,"regarded, were totally different from what they had been in the time of"
1891,III.,"Theroulde, or of the anonymous author of ""The Quatre Fils Aymon;"" the"
1892,III.,"Renaissance, with its keen artistic sense, made out of the Carolingian"
1893,III.,"tales real works of art, but works of art which were playthings. To"
1894,III.,"begin with, the Carolingian stories had been saturated with Arthurian"
1895,III.,"colour: they had been furnished with all the knight-rrantry, all the"
1896,III.,"gallantry, all the enchantments, the fairies, giants, and necromancers"
1897,III.,"of the Keltic legends; and, moreover, they had lost, by infinite"
1898,III.,"repetition, all the political realism and meaning so striking in ""The"
1899,III.,"Chanson de Roland"" and ""The Quatre Fils Aymon;"" a confusion and"
1900,III.,unreality further increased by the fact that the Italians had no
1901,III.,"original connection with those tales, that to them real men and plans"
1902,III.,"were no better than imaginary ones, and that the minstrels who sang in"
1903,III.,"the market-place, and the laborious prose-writers who compiled such"
1904,III.,"collections as that called of the ""Reali di Francia,"" were equally free"
1905,III.,"in their alterations and adaptations, creating unknown relationships,"
1906,III.,"inventing new adventures, suppressing essential historical points, with"
1907,III.,no object save amusing their audience or readers with new stories about
1908,III.,familiar heroes. Such was the condition of the stories themselves. The
1909,III.,"attitude of the public towards them was, by the middle of the fifteenth"
1910,III.,"century, one of complete incredulity and frivolous amusement; the"
1911,III.,paladins were as unreal as the heroes of any granny's fairy tale. The
1912,III.,"people wanted to hear of wonderful battles and adventures, of"
1913,III.,"enchantments and love-makings; but they wanted also to laugh; and,"
1914,III.,"sceptical, practical, democratic, the artizans and shopkeepers of"
1915,III.,"Florence--to whom, paying, as they did, expensive mercenaries who stole"
1916,III.,"poultry and never got wounded on any account, all chivalry or real"
1917,III.,military honour was the veriest nursery rubbish--such people as crowded
1918,III.,"round the _cantastoria_ of _mercato vecchio_, must indeed have found"
1919,III.,much to amuse them in these tales of so different an age.
1920,III.,
1921,III.,And into such crowds there penetrated to listen and watch (even as the
1922,III.,Magnificent Lorenzo had elbowed among the carnival ragamuffins of
1923,III.,"Florence, and had slid in among the holiday-making peasants of Poggio a"
1924,III.,"Caiano) a learned man, a poet, an intimate of the Medicis, of Politian,"
1925,III.,"Ficino, and Pico della Mirandola, Messer Luigi Pulci, the same who had"
1926,III.,"written the semi-allegorical, semi-realistic poem about Lorenzo dei"
1927,III.,"Medici's gala tournament. There was a taste in the house of the Medici,"
1928,III.,"together with those for platonic philosophy, classical erudition,"
1929,III.,"religious hymns, and Hebrew kabbala, for a certain kind of realism, for"
1930,III.,"the language and mode of thinking of the lower classes, as a reaction"
1931,III.,from Petrarchesque conventionality. As the Magnificent Lorenzo had had
1932,III.,the fancy to string together in more artistic shape the quaint and
1933,III.,"graceful love poems, hyperbolical, realistic, tender, and abusive, of"
1934,III.,the Tuscan peasantry; so also Messer Luigi Pulci appears to have been
1935,III.,smitten with the notion of trying his hand at a chivalric poem like
1936,III.,those to which he and his friends had listened among the butchers and
1937,III.,"pork-shops, the fishmongers and frying booths of the market, and giving"
1938,III.,"an impression, in its ideas and language, of the people to whom such"
1939,III.,strains were sung. But Luigi Pulci was vastly less gifted as a poet than
1940,III.,Lorenzo dei Medici; Florentine prentices are less æsthetically pleasing
1941,III.,"than Tuscan peasants, and the ""Morgante Maggiore"" is a piece of work of"
1942,III.,"a sort utterly inferior to the ""Nencia da Barberino."" Still the"
1943,III.,"""Morgante Maggiore"" remains, and will remain, as a very remarkable"
1944,III.,production of grotesque art. Just as Lorenzo dei Medici was certainly
1945,III.,not without a deliberate purpose of selecting the quaintness and
1946,III.,"gracefulness of peasant life; even so, and perhaps more, Luigi Pulci"
1947,III.,must have had a deliberate intention of producing a ludicrous effect; in
1948,III.,"both cases the deliberate attempt is very little perceptible, in the"
1949,III.,"""Nencia da Barberino"" from the genius of Lorenzo, in the ""Morgante"
1950,III.,"Maggiore"" from the stolidity of Pulci. The ""Morgante,"" of which parts"
1951,III.,"were probably written as a mere sample to amuse a supper party, became"
1952,III.,"interesting to Pulci, in the mere matter of inventing and stringing"
1953,III.,"together new incidents; and despite its ludicrous passages, it must have"
1954,III.,"been more seriously written by him, and more seriously listened to by"
1955,III.,"his friends, than would a similar production now-a-days. For the men of"
1956,III.,"the Renaissance, no matter how philosophized and cultured, retained the"
1957,III.,"pleasure in mere incident, which we moderns seem to have given over to"
1958,III.,"children and savages; and Lorenzo, Ficino, and Politian probably"
1959,III.,listened to the adventures of Luigi Pulci's paladins and giants with
1960,III.,"much the same interest, and only a little more conscious sense of"
1961,III.,"grotesqueness, with which the crowd in the market listened to Cristofano"
1962,III.,"dell' Altissimo and similar story-tellers. The ""Morgante Maggiore,"""
1963,III.,"therefore, is neither really comic nor really serious. It is not a piece"
1964,III.,"of realistic grotesqueness like ""Gargantua"" or ""Pantagruel,"" any more"
1965,III.,"than it is a serious ideal work like ""Amadis de Gaula:"" the proportion"
1966,III.,"of deliberately sought effects is small; the great bulk, serious or"
1967,III.,"comic, seems to have come quite at random. It is not a caricatured"
1968,III.,"reproduction of the poems of chivalry sung in the market, for they were"
1969,III.,"probably serious, stately, and bald, with at most an occasional joke; it"
1970,III.,"is the reproduction of the joint impression received from the absurd,"
1971,III.,"harum-scarum, unpractical world of chivalry of the poet, and the real"
1972,III.,"world of prose, of good-humoured buffoonish coarseness with which the"
1973,III.,"itinerant poet was surrounded. The paladins are no Don Quixotes, the"
1974,III.,"princesses no Dulcineas, the battles are real battles; but the language"
1975,III.,"is that of Florentine wool-workers, housewives, cheese-sellers, and"
1976,III.,"ragamuffins, crammed with the slang of the market-place, its heavy jokes"
1977,III.,and perpetual sententious aphorism. Moreover the prominence given to
1978,III.,food and eating is unrivalled except by Rabelais: the poet must have
1979,III.,"lounged with delight through the narrow mediæval lanes, crowded with"
1980,III.,"booths and barrows, sniffing with rapture the mingled scents of cheese,"
1981,III.,"pork, fish, spices, and a hundred strange concomitant market smells. And"
1982,III.,"the market, that classic _mercato vecchio_ (alas, finally condemned and"
1983,III.,"destroyed by modern sanitary prudishness, and which only those who have"
1984,III.,"seen can conceive in its full barbarous, nay, barbaric Pantagruelian"
1985,III.,"splendour of food, blood, and stenches) of Florence, is what we think of"
1986,III.,"throughout the poem. And, when Messer Luigi comes to narrate, with real"
1987,III.,"gravity and after the due invocation of the Virgin, the Trinity, and"
1988,III.,"the saints, the tremendous disaster of Roncevaux, he uses such words and"
1989,III.,"such similes, that above the neighing of horses and the clash of"
1990,III.,hurtling armour and the yells of the combatants we suddenly hear the
1991,III.,"nasal sing-song of Florentine tripe-vendors and pumpkin-pod-sellers, the"
1992,III.,chaffer and oaths and laughter of the gluttonous crowd pouring through
1993,III.,the lanes of Calimala and Pellicceria; nay (horrible and grotesque
1994,III.,"miracle), there seems to rise out of the confused darkness of the"
1995,III.,"battle-filled valley, there seems to disengage itself (as out of a mist)"
1996,III.,"from the chaos of heaped bodies, and the flash of steel among the"
1997,III.,"whirlwinds of dust, a vision, more and more distinct and familiar, of"
1998,III.,"the crowded square with its black rough-hewn, smoke-stained houses,"
1999,III.,ornamented with Robbia-ware angels and lilies or painted madonnas; of
2000,III.,"its black butchers dens, outside which hang the ghastly disembowelled"
2001,III.,"sheep with blood-stained fleeces, the huge red-veined hearts and livers;"
2002,III.,"of the piles of cabbage and cauli-flowers, the rows of tin ware and"
2003,III.,"copper saucepans, the heaps of maccaroni and pastes, of spices and"
2004,III.,drugs; the garlands of onions and red peppers and piles of apples; the
2005,III.,"fetid sliminess of the fish tressels; the rough pavement oozy and black,"
2006,III.,"slippery with cabbage-stalks, puddled with bullock's blood, strewn with"
2007,III.,"plucked feathers--all under the bright blue sky, with Giotto's"
2008,III.,"dove-coloured belfry soaring high above; a vision, finally, of one of"
2009,III.,"those deep dens, with walls, all covered with majolica plates and"
2010,III.,"dishes and flashing brass-embossed trenchers, in the dark depths of"
2011,III.,"which crackles perennially a ruddy fire, while a huge spit revolves,"
2012,III.,offering to the flames now one now the other side of scores of legs of
2013,III.,"mutton, rounds of beef, and larded chickens, trickling with the butter"
2014,III.,"unceasingly ladled by the white-dressed cooks. Roncisvalle, Charlemagne,"
2015,III.,"the paladins, paganism, Christendom--what of them? ""I believe in capon,"
2016,III.,"roast or boiled, and sometimes done in butter; in mead and in must; and"
2017,III.,"I believe in the pasty and the pastykins, mother and children; but above"
2018,III.,"all things I believe in good wine ""--as Margutte snuffles out in his"
2019,III.,"catechism; and as to Saracens and paladins, past, present, and future, a"
2020,III.,fig for them!
2021,III.,
2022,III.,"But meanwhile, for all that Florentine burgesses, artizans, and"
2023,III.,"humorists may think, there is in this Italy of the Renaissance something"
2024,III.,"besides Florence; there is a school of poetry, disconnected with the"
2025,III.,"realisms of Lorenzo and Pulci, with the Ovidian Petrarchisms of"
2026,III.,"Politian. There is Ferrara. Lying, as they do, between the Northern"
2027,III.,"Apennine slopes of Modena and the Euganean hills, the dominions of the"
2028,III.,House of Este appear at first sight merely as part and parcel of
2029,III.,"Lombardy, and we should expect from them nothing very different from"
2030,III.,that which we expect from Milan or Bologna or Padua. But the truth is
2031,III.,"different; all round Ferrara, indeed, stretches the fertile flatness of"
2032,III.,"Lombard cornfields, and they produce, as infallibly as they produce"
2033,III.,"their sacks of grain and tuns of wine and heaps of silk cocoon, the"
2034,III.,intellectual and social equivalents of such things in Renaissance Italy:
2035,III.,"industry, wealth, comfort, scepticism, art. But on either side, into the"
2036,III.,"defiles of the Euganean hills to the north, into the widening torrent"
2037,III.,"valleys of the Modenese Apennines to the south, the Marquisate of Este"
2038,III.,"stretches up into feudalism, into chivalry, into the imaginative kingdom"
2039,III.,"of the Middle Ages. Mediævalism, feudalism, chivalry, indeed, of a very"
2040,III.,modified sort; and as different from that of France and Germany as
2041,III.,differ from the poverty-stricken plains and forests and and moors of the
2042,III.,"north these Italian mountain slopes, along which the vines crawl in long"
2043,III.,"trellises, and the chestnuts rise in endlessly superposed tiers of"
2044,III.,"terraces, cultivated by a peasant who is not the serf, but the equal"
2045,III.,sharer in profits with the master of the soil. And on one of those
2046,III.,"fertile hill-sides, looking down upon a narrow valley all a green-blue"
2047,III.,"shimmer with corn and vine-bearing elms, was born, in the year 1434,"
2048,III.,"Matteo Maria Boiardo, in the village which gave him the title, one of"
2049,III.,"the highest in the Estensian dominions, of Count of Scandiano. Here, in"
2050,III.,"the Apennines, Scandiano is a fortified village, also a castle,"
2051,III.,"doubtless half turned into a Renaissance villa, but mediæval and feudal"
2052,III.,"nevertheless; but the name of Scandiano belongs also, I know not for"
2053,III.,"what reason, to a certain little red-brick palace on the outskirts of"
2054,III.,"Ferrara, beautifully painted with half-allegorical, half-realistic"
2055,III.,"pageant frescoes by Cosimo Tura, and enclosing a sweet tangled"
2056,III.,"orchard-garden; to all of which, being the place to which Duke Borso and"
2057,III.,"Duke Ercole were wont to retire for amusement, the Ferrarese have given"
2058,III.,"the further name of Schifanoia, which means, ""fly from cares."" This"
2059,III.,"little coincidence of Scandiano the feudal castle in the Apennines, and"
2060,III.,"Scandiano the little pleasure palace at Ferrara, seems to give, by"
2061,III.,"accidental allegory, a fair idea of the double nature of Matteo Boiardo,"
2062,III.,"of the Ferrarese court to which he belonged, and of the school of poetry"
2063,III.,(including the more notable but less original work of Ariosto) which the
2064,III.,genius of the man and the character of the court succeeded together in
2065,III.,producing.
2066,III.,
2067,III.,To understand Boiardo we must compare him with Ariosto; and to
2068,III.,understand Ariosto we must compare him with Boiardo; both belong to the
2069,III.,"same school, and are men of very similar genius, and where the one"
2070,III.,"leaves off the other begins. But first, in order to understand the"
2071,III.,"character of this poetry which, in the main, is identical in Boiardo and"
2072,III.,"in his more successful but less fascinating pupil Ariosto, let us"
2073,III.,"understand Ferrara. It was, in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth"
2074,III.,"centuries, a chivalric town of Ariostesque chivalry: feudalism turned"
2075,III.,"courtly and elegant, and moreover, very liberal and comfortable by"
2076,III.,"preponderance of democratic and industrial habits; a military court, of"
2077,III.,"brave mercenary captains full of dash and adventure, not mere brigands"
2078,III.,"and marauders having studied strategy, like the little Umbrian"
2079,III.,"chieftains; a court orderly, elegant, and brilliant: a prince not risen"
2080,III.,"from behind a counter like Medicis and Petruccis, nor out of blood like"
2081,III.,"Baglionis and Sforzas, but of a noble old house whose beginnings are"
2082,III.,lost in the mist of real chivalry and real paladinism; a duke with a
2083,III.,"pretence of feudal honour and decorum, at whose court men were all brave"
2084,III.,and ladies all chaste--with the little licenses of baseness and
2085,III.,"gallantry admitted by Renaissance chivalry. A bright, brilliant court at"
2086,III.,the close of the fifteenth century; and more stable than the only one
2087,III.,"which might have rivalled it, the Feltrian court of Urbino, too small"
2088,III.,"and lost among the Umbrian bandits. A bright, brilliant town, also, this"
2089,III.,"Ferrara: not mercantile like Florence, not mere barracks like Perugia; a"
2090,III.,"capital, essentially, in its rich green plain by the widened Po, with"
2091,III.,its broad handsome streets (so different from the mediæval exchanges of
2092,III.,"Bologna, and the feudal alleys of Perugia), its well-built houses, so"
2093,III.,"safe and modern, needing neither _bravi_ nor iron window bars, protected"
2094,III.,"(except against some stray murder by one of the Estensi themselves), by"
2095,III.,"the duke's well-organized police; houses with well-trimmed gardens, like"
2096,III.,"so many Paris hôtels; and with the grand russet brick castle, military"
2097,III.,"with its moat and towers, urban with its belvederes and balconies, in"
2098,III.,"the middle, well placed to sweep away with its guns (the wonderful guns"
2099,III.,"of the duke's own making) any riot, tidily, cleanly, without a nasty"
2100,III.,heap of bodies and slop of blood as in the narrow streets of other
2101,III.,"towns Imagine this bright capital, placed, moreover, in the richest"
2102,III.,"centre of Lombardy, with glitter of chivalry from the Euganean hills and"
2103,III.,"Apennines (castellated with Este, Monselice, Canossa, and Boiardo's own"
2104,III.,Scandiano); with gorgeous rarities of commerce from Venice and Milan--a
2105,III.,"central, unique spot. It is the natural home of the chivalrous poets of"
2106,III.,"the Renaissance, Boiardo, Ariosto, Tasso; as Florence is of the"
2107,III.,Politians and Pulcis (Hellenism and back-shopery); and Venice of the
2108,III.,"literature of lust, jests, cynicism, and adventure, Aretine, Beolco,"
2109,III.,"Calmo, and Poliphilo-Colonna. In that garden, where the white"
2110,III.,butterflies crowd among the fruit trees bowed down to the tall grass of
2111,III.,"the palace of Schifanoia--a garden neither grand nor classic, but"
2112,III.,elegiac and charming--we can imagine Boiardo or Ariosto reading their
2113,III.,"poems to just such a goodly company as Giraldi Cinthio (a Ferrarese, and"
2114,III.,"fond of romance, too) describes in the prologue of his ""Ecatomiti:"""
2115,III.,"gentle and sprightful ladies, with the splendid brocaded robes, and the"
2116,III.,gold-filleted golden hair of Dosso Dossi's wonderful Alcina Circe;
2117,III.,graceful youths like the princely St. John of Benvenuto Garofalo;
2118,III.,jesters like Dosso's at Modena; brilliant captains like his St. George
2119,III.,and St. Michael; and a little crowd of pages with doublets and sleeves
2120,III.,"laced with gold tags, of sedate magistrates in fur robes and scarlet"
2121,III.,"caps, of white-dressed maids with instruments of music and embroidery"
2122,III.,"frames and hand looms, like those which Cosimo Tura painted for Duke"
2123,III.,Borso on the walls of this same Schifanoia palace. Such is the audience;
2124,III.,now for the poems.
2125,III.,
2126,III.,The stuff of Boiardo and Ariosto is the same: that old mediæval stuff of
2127,III.,"the Carolingian poems, coloured, scented with Arthurian chivalry and"
2128,III.,wonder. The knight-errantry of the Keltic tales is cleverly blended with
2129,III.,the pseudo-historical military organization of the Carolingian cycle.
2130,III.,"Paladins and Saracens are ingeniously manoeuvred about, now scattered in"
2131,III.,"little groups of twos and threes, to encounter adventures in the style"
2132,III.,of Sir Launcelot or Amadis; now gathered into a compact army to crash
2133,III.,upon each other as at Roncevaux; or else wildly flung up by the poet to
2134,III.,"alight in fairyland, to find themselves in the caverns of Jamschid, in"
2135,III.,"the isles where Oberon's mother kept Cæsar, and Morgana kept Ogier, in"
2136,III.,"the boats, entering subterranean channels, of Sindbad and Huon of"
2137,III.,Bordeaux; a constant alternation of individual adventure and wholesale
2138,III.,"organized campaigns, conceived and carried out with admirable ingenuity."
2139,III.,So much for the deeds of arms. The deeds of love are also compounded of
2140,III.,"Carolingian and Arthurian, but flavoured with special Renaissance"
2141,III.,feeling. There is a great deal of rapid love-making between too gallant
2142,III.,knights and too impressionable ladies; licentious amours which we
2143,III.,"moderns lay at the door of Boiardo and Ariosto, not knowing that the"
2144,III.,licentiousness of the Olivers and Ogiers and Guerins and Huons of
2145,III.,"mediæval poetry, of the sentimental Amadises, Galaors, and Lisvarts of"
2146,III.,"the fourteenth century, whom the Renaissance has toned down in Rogers"
2147,III.,"and Rinaldos and Ricciardettos, is by many degrees worse. A moral"
2148,III.,improvement also (for all the immorality of the Renaissance) in the
2149,III.,"eschewing of the never-failing adultery of the Arthurian romances, and"
2150,III.,the appropriation to legitimately faithful love of the poetical devotion
2151,III.,which Tristram and Launcelot bear to other men's wives. To this are
2152,III.,"added, and more by Ariosto than by Boiardo, two essentially Italian"
2153,III.,elements: something of the nobility of passion of the Platonic
2154,III.,"sonneteers; and a good dose of the ironical, scurrilous, moralizing"
2155,III.,immoral anecdote gossiping of Boccaccio and Sacchetti. Such is the
2156,III.,"stuff. The conception, though rarely comic, and sometimes _bond fide_"
2157,III.,"serious, is never earnest. All this is a purely artistic world, a world"
2158,III.,"of decorative arabesque incident, intended to please, scarcely ever to"
2159,III.,"move, or to move, at most, like some Decameronian tale of Isabella and"
2160,III.,"the Basil Plant, or Constance and Martuccio. On the other hand, there is"
2161,III.,none of the grotesque irreverence of Pulci. Boiardo and Ariosto are not
2162,III.,in earnest; they are well aware that their heroes and heroines are mere
2163,III.,"modern men and women tricked out in pretty chivalric trappings, driven"
2164,III.,"wildly about from Paris to Cathay, and from Spain to the Orkneys--on"
2165,III.,Tony Lumpkin's principle of driving his mother round and round the
2166,III.,garden plot till she thought herself on a heath six miles off--without
2167,III.,"ever really changing place. But they do not, like Pulci, make fun of"
2168,III.,their characters. They write chivalry romances not for Florentine
2169,III.,"pork-butchers and wool-carders, but for gallant ladies and gentlemen, to"
2170,III.,"whom, with duels, tournaments, serenades, and fine speeches, chivalry is"
2171,III.,"an admired name, though no longer a respected reality."
2172,III.,
2173,III.,The heroes of Boiardo and of Ariosto are always bold and gallant and
2174,III.,"glittering, the spirit of romance is in them; a giant Sancho Panza like"
2175,III.,"Morgante, redolent of sausage and cheese, would never be admitted into"
2176,III.,the society of a Ferrarese Orlando. The art of Boiardo and of Ariosto is
2177,III.,"eminently pageant art, in which sentiment and heroism are but as one"
2178,III.,element among many; there is no pretence at reality (although there is a
2179,III.,"good deal of incidental realism), and no thought of the interest in"
2180,III.,"subject and persons which goes with reality. It is a masquerade, and one"
2181,III.,"whose men and women must, I think, be imagined in a kind of artistic"
2182,III.,"fancy costume: a mixture of the Renaissance dress and of the antique, as"
2183,III.,"we see it in the prints of contemporary pageants, and in Venetian and"
2184,III.,"Ferrarese pictures; that Circe of Dosso's, in the Borghese gallery of"
2185,III.,"Rome, seated in her stately wine-lees and gold half-heraldically and"
2186,III.,"half-cabalistically patterned brocade, before the rose-bushes of the"
2187,III.,"little mysterious wood, is the very ideal of the Falerinas and Alcinas,"
2188,III.,"of the enchantresses of Boiardo and Ariosto. Pageant people, these of"
2189,III.,"the Ferrarese poets; they only play at being in forests and deserts, as"
2190,III.,children play at being on volcanoes or in Green-land by the nursery
2191,III.,"fire. It is a kind of dressing up, a masquerading of the fancy; not"
2192,III.,"disguising in order to deceive, but rather laying hold of any pretty or"
2193,III.,"brilliant impressive garb that comes to hand, and putting that on in"
2194,III.,"conjunction with many odds and ends, as an artist's guests might do with"
2195,III.,the silks and velvets and Oriental properties of a studio. These knights
2196,III.,"and ladies, for ever tearing about from Scotland to India, never, in"
2197,III.,"point of fact, get any further than the Apennine slopes where Boiardo"
2198,III.,"was born, where Ariosto governed the Garfagnana. They ride for ever"
2199,III.,(while supposed to be in the Ardennes or in Egypt) across the velvet
2200,III.,"moss turf, all patterned with minute starry clovers and the fallen white"
2201,III.,"ropy chestnut blossom, amidst the bracken beneath the slender chestnut"
2202,III.,"trees, the pale blue sky looking in between their spreading branches; at"
2203,III.,"most they lose their way in the intricacies of some seaside pineta,"
2204,III.,"where the feet slip on the fallen needles, and the sun slants along the"
2205,III.,"vistas of serried, red, scaly trunks, among the juniper and gorse and"
2206,III.,dry grass and flowers growing in the sea sand. Into the vast mediæval
2207,III.,"forests of Germany and France, Boiardo and Ariosto's fancy never"
2208,III.,penetrated.
2209,III.,
2210,III.,Such is the school: a school represented in its typical character only
2211,III.,"by Boiardo and Ariosto, but to which belong, nevertheless, with whatever"
2212,III.,"differences, Tasso, Spenser, Camoens, all the poets of Renaissance"
2213,III.,romance. Now of the two leaders thereof. Here I feel that I can speak
2214,III.,only personally; tell only of my own personal impressions and
2215,III.,"preferences. Comparing together Boiardo and Ariosto, I am, of course,"
2216,III.,aware of the infinite advantages of the latter. Ariosto is a man of far
2217,III.,"more varied genius; he is an artist, while Boiardo is an amateur; he is"
2218,III.,learned in arranging and ornamenting; he knows how to alternate various
2219,III.,"styles, how to begin and how to end. Moreover, he is a scholarly person"
2220,III.,"of a more scholarly time: he is familiar with the classics, and, what is"
2221,III.,"more important, he is familiar with the language in which he is writing."
2222,III.,"He writes exquisitely harmonious, supple, and brilliant Tuscan verse,"
2223,III.,with an infinite richness of diction; while poor Boiardo jogs along in a
2224,III.,"language which is not the Lombard dialect in which he speaks, and which"
2225,III.,"is very uncouth and awkward, as is every pure language for a provincial;"
2226,III.,"indeed, so much so, that the pedantic Tuscans require Berni to make"
2227,III.,"Tuscan, elegant, to _ingentilire_, with infinite loss to quaintness and"
2228,III.,"charm, the ""Orlando Innamorato"" of poor Ferrarese Boiardo. Moreover,"
2229,III.,"Ariosto has many qualities unknown to Boiardo; wit, malice, stateliness,"
2230,III.,decided eloquence and power of simile and apostrophe; he is a symphony
2231,III.,"for full orchestra, and Boiardo a mere melody played on a single fiddle,"
2232,III.,which good authorities (and no one dare contest with Italians when they
2233,III.,condemn anything not Tuscan as jargon) pronounce to be no Cremona. All
2234,III.,these advantages Ariosto certainly has; and I do not quarrel with those
2235,III.,who prefer him for them. But many of them distinctly take away from my
2236,III.,pleasure. I confess that I am bored by the beautifully written moral and
2237,III.,allegorical preludes of Ariosto's cantos; I would willingly give all his
2238,III.,"aphorism and all his mythology to get quickly to the story. Also, I"
2239,III.,"resent his admirable rhetorical flourishes about his patrons, his"
2240,III.,"Ercoles, Ippolitos, and Isabellas they ring false, dreadfully false and"
2241,III.,studied; and Boiardo's quickly despatched friendly greeting of his
2242,III.,"friends, his courteous knights and gentle ladies, pleases me much"
2243,III.,"better. Moreover, the all-pervading consciousness of the existence of"
2244,III.,"Homer, Virgil, nay, Statius and Lucan, every trumpery antique"
2245,III.,"epic-monger, annoys me, giving an uncomfortable doubt as to whether"
2246,III.,"Ariosto did not try to make all this nonsense serious, and this romance"
2247,III.,"into an epic; all this occasional Virgilian stateliness, alternated with"
2248,III.,"a kind of polished Decameronian gossipy cynicism, diverts my attention,"
2249,III.,"turns paladins and princesses too much into tutor-educated gentlemen,"
2250,III.,into Bandello and Cinthio-reading ladies of the sixteenth century. The
2251,III.,"picture painted by Ariosto is finer, but you see too much of the"
2252,III.,"painter; he and his patrons take up nearly the whole foreground, and"
2253,III.,"they have affected, idealized faces and would-be dignified and"
2254,III.,"senatorial poses. For these and many other reasons, I personally prefer"
2255,III.,Boiardo; and perhaps the best reason for my preference is the
2256,III.,"irrational one that he gives me more pleasure. My preferences, my"
2257,III.,"impressions, I have said, are in this matter, much less critical than"
2258,III.,personal. Hence I can speak of Boiardo only as he affects me.
2259,III.,
2260,III.,"When first I read Boiardo, I was conscious of a curious phenomenon in"
2261,III.,myself. I must confess to reading books usually in a very ardent or
2262,III.,"rather weary manner, either way in a hurry to finish them. As it"
2263,III.,"happened, when I borrowed Boiardo, I had a great many other things on"
2264,III.,hand which required my time and attention; yet I could not make up my
2265,III.,"mind to return the book until I had finished it, though my intention had"
2266,III.,"been merely to satisfy my curiosity by a dip into it. I went on, without"
2267,III.,that eager desire to know what follows which one has in a novel;
2268,III.,"drowsily with absolute reluctance to leave off, like the reluctance to"
2269,III.,rise from the grass beneath the trees with only butterflies and shadows
2270,III.,"to watch, or the reluctance to put aside some fairy book of Walter"
2271,III.,"Crane's. It was like strolling in some quaint, ill-trimmed, old garden,"
2272,III.,"finding fresh flowers, fresh bits of lichened walls, fresh fragments of"
2273,III.,"broken earthenware ornaments; or, rather, more like a morning in the"
2274,III.,"Cathedral Library at Siena, the place where the gorgeous choir books are"
2275,III.,"kept, itself illuminated like missal pages by Pinturicchio: amused,"
2276,III.,"delighted, not moved nor fascinated; finding every moment something new,"
2277,III.,"some charming piece of gilding, some sweet plumed head, some quaint"
2278,III.,little tree or town; making a journey of lazy discovery in a sort of
2279,III.,"world of Prince Charmings, the real realm of the ""Färy Queen,"" quite"
2280,III.,"different in enchantment from the country of Spenser's Gloriana, with"
2281,III.,"its pale allegoric ladies and knights, half-human, half-metaphysical,"
2282,III.,and its make-believe allegorical ogres and giants. This is the real
2283,III.,"Fairyland, this of Boiardo: no mere outskirts of Ferrara, with real,"
2284,III.,playfully cynical Ferrarese men and women tricked out as paladins and
2285,III.,"Amazons, and making fun of their disguise, as in Ariosto; no wonderland"
2286,III.,"of Tasso, with enchanted gardens copied out of Bolognese pictures and"
2287,III.,"miraculous forests learned from theatre mechanicians, wonders imitated"
2288,III.,by a great poet from the cardboard and firework wonders of Bianca
2289,III.,"Cappello's wedding feasts. This is the real fairyland, the wonderland of"
2290,III.,"mediæval romance and of Persian and Arabian tales, no longer solemn or"
2291,III.,"awful, but brilliant, sunny, only half believed in; the fairyland of the"
2292,III.,"Renaissance, superficially artistic, with its lightest, brightest"
2293,III.,"fancies, and its charming realities; its cloistered and painted courts"
2294,III.,"with plashing fountains, its tapestried and inlaid rooms, its towered"
2295,III.,"and belvedered villas, its quaint clipped gardens full of strange"
2296,III.,Oriental plants and beasts; and all this transported into a country of
2297,III.,"wonders, where are the gardens of the Hesperides, the fountain of"
2298,III.,"Merlin, the tomb of Narcissus, the castle of Morgan-le-Fay; every quaint"
2299,III.,"and beautiful fancy, antique and mediæval, mixed up together, as in some"
2300,III.,"Renaissance picture of Botticelli or Rosselli or Filippino, where"
2301,III.,"knights in armour descend from Pegasus before Roman temples, where"
2302,III.,"swarthy white-turbaned Turks, with oddly bunched-up trousers and"
2303,III.,"jewelled caftans, and half-naked, oak-crowned youths, like genii"
2304,III.,"descended, pensive and wondering, from some antique sarcophagus, and"
2305,III.,"dapper princelets and stalwart knights, and citizens and monks, all"
2306,III.,crowd round the altar of some wonder-working Macone or Apolline or
2307,III.,"Trevigante; some comic, dreadful, apish figure, mummed up in"
2308,III.,"half-antique, half-oriental garb. Or else we are led into some dainty,"
2309,III.,"pale-tinted panel of Botticelli, where the maidens dance in white"
2310,III.,"clinging clothes, strewing flowers on to the flower-freaked turf; or"
2311,III.,"into some of Poliphilo's vignettes, where the gentle ladies, seated with"
2312,III.,"lute and viol under vine-trellises, welcome the young gallant, or poet,"
2313,III.,or knight.
2314,III.,
2315,III.,"Such is the world of Boiardo. Spenser has once or twice peeped in,"
2316,III.,"painted it, and given us exquisite little pictures, as that of"
2317,III.,"Malecasta's castle, all hung with mythological tapestries, that of the"
2318,III.,"enchanted chamber of Britomart, and those of Sir Calidore meeting the"
2319,III.,Graces and of Hellenore dancing with the Satyrs; but Spenser has done it
2320,III.,"rarely, trembling to return to his dreary allegories. Equal to these"
2321,III.,"single pictures by Spenser, Boiardo has only one or two, but he keeps us"
2322,III.,permanently in the world where such pictures are painted. Boiardo is not
2323,III.,"a great artist like Spenser: but he is a wizard, which is better. He"
2324,III.,"leads us, unceasingly, through the little dreamy laurelwoods, where we"
2325,III.,"meet crisp-haired damsels tied to pine-trees, or terrible dragons, or"
2326,III.,"enchanted wells, through whose translucent green waters we see brocaded"
2327,III.,rooms full of fair ladies; he ferries us ever and anon across shallow
2328,III.,"streams, to the castles where _gentil donzelle_ wave their kerchiefs"
2329,III.,from the pillared belvedere; he slips us unseen into the camps and
2330,III.,"council-rooms of the splendidly trapped Saracens, like so many figures"
2331,III.,out of Filippino's frescoes; he conducts us across the bridges where
2332,III.,"giants stand warders, to the mysterious carved tombs whence issue green"
2333,III.,"and crested snakes, who, kissed by a paladin, turn into lovely"
2334,III.,enchantresses; he takes us beneath the beds of rivers and through the
2335,III.,"bowels of the earth where kings and knights turned into statues of gold,"
2336,III.,"sit round tables covered with jewels, illumined by carbuncles more"
2337,III.,"wonderful than that of Jamschid; or through the mazes of fairy gardens,"
2338,III.,"where every ear of corn, cut off, turns into a wild beast, and every"
2339,III.,"fallen leaf into a bird, where hydras watch in the waters and lamias"
2340,III.,"rear themselves in the grass, where Orlando must fill his helmet with"
2341,III.,roses lest he hear the voice of the sirens; where all the wonders of
2342,III.,"Antiquity--the snake-women, the Circes, the sirens, the hydras and fauns"
2343,III.,"live, strangely changed into something infinitely quaint and graceful,"
2344,III.,"still half-antique, yet already half-Arabian or Keltic, in the midst of"
2345,III.,"the fairyland of Merlin and of Oberon--live, move, transform themselves"
2346,III.,"afresh; where the golden-haired damsels and the stripling knights,"
2347,III.,"delicate like Pinturicchio's Prince Charmings, gallop for ever on their"
2348,III.,"enchanted coursers, within enchanted armour, invincible, invulnerable,"
2349,III.,"under a sky always blue, and through an unceasing spring, ever onwards"
2350,III.,"to new adventures. Adventures which the noble, gentle Castellan of"
2351,III.,"Scandiano, poet and knight and humorist, philanthropical philosopher"
2352,III.,"almost from sheer goodness of heart, yet a little crazy, and capable of"
2353,III.,setting all the church bells ringing in honour of the invention of the
2354,III.,name of Rodomonte relates not to some dully ungrateful Alfonso or
2355,III.,"Ippolito, but to his own guests, his own brilliant knights and ladies,"
2356,III.,"with ever and anon an effort to make them feel, through his verse, some"
2357,III.,of those joyous spring-tide feelings which bubble up in himself; as when
2358,III.,"he remembers how, ""Once did I wander on a May morning in a fair"
2359,III.,"flower-adorned field on a hillside overlooking the sea, which was all"
2360,III.,"tremulous with light; and there, among the roses of a green thorn-brake,"
2361,III.,a damsel was singing of love; singing so sweetly that the sweetness
2362,III.,"still touches my heart; touches my heart, and makes me think of the"
2363,III.,"great delight it was to listen;"" and how he would fain repeat that song,"
2364,III.,"and indeed an echo of its sweetness runs through his verse. Meanwhile,"
2365,III.,"stanza pours out after stanza, adventure grows out of adventure, each"
2366,III.,"more wonderful, more gorgeous than its predecessor. To which listen the"
2367,III.,"ladies, with their white, girdled dresses and crimped golden locks; the"
2368,III.,"youths, with their soft beardless faces framed in combed-out hair, with"
2369,III.,their daggers on their hips and their plumed hats between their fingers;
2370,III.,"and the serious bearded men, in silken robes; drawing nearer the poet,"
2371,III.,letting go lute or violin or music-book as they listen on the villa
2372,III.,"terrace or in some darkened room, where the sunset sky turns green-blue"
2373,III.,"behind the pillared window, and the roses hang over the trellise of the"
2374,III.,"cloister. And as they did four hundred years ago, so do we now, rejoice."
2375,III.,The great stalwart naked forms of Greece no longer leap and wrestle or
2376,III.,carry their well-poised baskets of washed linen before us; the mailed
2377,III.,and vizored knights of the Nibelungen no longer clash their armour to
2378,III.,the sound of Volker's red fiddle-bow; the glorified souls of Dante no
2379,III.,longer move in mystic mazes of light before the eyes of our fancy. All
2380,III.,that is gone. But here is the fairyland of the Renaissance. And thus
2381,III.,"Matteo Boiardo, Count of Scandiano, goes on, adding adventure to"
2382,III.,"adventure, stanza to stanza, in his castle villa, or his palace at"
2383,III.,Ferrara. But suddenly he stops and his bright fiddle and lute music jars
2384,III.,"and ends: ""While I am singing, O Redeeming God, I see all Italy set on"
2385,III.,"fire by these Gauls, coming to ravage I know not what fresh place."""
2386,III.,
2387,III.,"And thus, with the earlier and more hopeful Renaissance of the fifteenth"
2388,III.,"century, Matteo Boiardo broke off with his ""Orlando Innamorato."" The"
2389,III.,"perfect light-heartedness, the delight in play of a gentle, serious,"
2390,III.,"eminently kindly nature, which gives half the charm to Boiardo's work,"
2391,III.,seems to have become impossible after the ruin of Italian liberty and
2392,III.,prosperity the frightful showing up of Italy's moral and social and
2393,III.,political insignificance at the beginning of the sixteenth century.
2394,III.,"Lombardy especially became a permanent battle-field, and its towns mere"
2395,III.,"garrison places of French, German, Spanish, and Swiss barbarians, whose"
2396,III.,presence meant slaughter and pillage and every foulest outrage; and
2397,III.,"then, between the horrors of the unresisted invasions and the unresisted"
2398,III.,"exactions, came plague and famine, and industry and commerce gradually"
2399,III.,"died out. A few princes, subsidised and guarded by French or"
2400,III.,"Imperialists, kept up an appearance of cheerfulness, but the courts even"
2401,III.,grew more gloomy as the people grew more miserable. There is more
2402,III.,"joking, more resonant laughter in Ariosto than in Boiardo, but there is"
2403,III.,very much less serenity and cheerfulness; ever and anon a sort of
2404,III.,"bitterness, a dreary moralizing tendency, a still more dreary fit of"
2405,III.,"prophesying future good in which he has no belief, comes over Ariosto."
2406,III.,"Berni, who rewrote the ""Orlando Innamorato"" in choice Tuscan, and who"
2407,III.,"underlined every faintly marked jest of Boiardo's, with evident"
2408,III.,"preoccupation of the ludicrous effects of the ""Morgante Maggiore""--Berni"
2409,III.,even could not keep up his spirits; into the middle of Boiardo's serene
2410,III.,fairyland adventures he inserted a description of the sack of Rome which
2411,III.,"is simply harrowing. All real cheerfulness departed from the people, to"
2412,III.,be replaced only by pleasure in the debaucheries of the buffoonish
2413,III.,"obscenity of Aretino, Bandello, and so forth, to which the men of the"
2414,III.,dying Italy of the Renaissance listened as the roysterers of the plague
2415,III.,"of Florence, with the mortal sickness almost upon them, may have"
2416,III.,listened to the filthy songs which they trolled out in their
2417,III.,"drunkenness. Or at best, the poor starved, bruised, battered, humiliated"
2418,III.,nation may have tried to be cheerful on the principle of its harlequin
2419,III.,"playwright Beolco, who, more honest than the Ariostos and Bibbienas, and"
2420,III.,"Aretines, came forward on his stage of planks at Padua, and after"
2421,III.,"describing the ruin and wretchedness of the country, the sense of"
2422,III.,"dreariness and desolation, which made young folk careless of marriage,"
2423,III.,"and the very nightingales (he thought) careless of song, recommended his"
2424,III.,"audience, since they could not even cry thoroughly and to feel any the"
2425,III.,"better for it, to laugh, if they still were able. Boiardo was forgotten;"
2426,III.,"his spirit was unsuited to the depression, gloomy brutality, gloomy"
2427,III.,"sentimentality, which grew every day as Italy settled down after its"
2428,III.,Renaissance-Shrovetide in the cinders and fasting of the long Lent of
2429,III.,Spanish and Jesuit rule.
2430,III.,
2431,III.,Still the style of Boiardo was not yet exhausted; the peculiar kind of
2432,III.,"fairy epic, the peculiar combination of chivalric and classic elements"
2433,III.,"of which the ""Orlando Innamorato"" and the ""Orlando Furioso,"" had been"
2434,III.,"the great examples, still fascinated poets and public. The Renaissance,"
2435,III.,"or what remained of it, was now no longer confined to Italy; it had"
2436,III.,"spread, paler, more diluted, shallower, over the rest of Europe. To"
2437,III.,"follow the filiation of schools, to understand the intellectual"
2438,III.,"relationships of individuals, of the latter half of the sixteenth"
2439,III.,"century, it becomes necessary to move from one country to another. And"
2440,III.,"thus the two brother poets of the family of Boiardo, its two last and"
2441,III.,"much saddened representatives, came to write in very different languages"
2442,III.,and under very different circumstances. These two are Tasso and our own
2443,III.,"Spenser. They are both poets of the school of the ""Orlando Innamorato,"""
2444,III.,"both poets of a reaction, of a kind of purified Renaissance: the one of"
2445,III.,the late Italian Renaissance emasculated by the Council of Trent and by
2446,III.,"Spain; the other of the English Renaissance, in its youth truly, but, in"
2447,III.,"the individual case of Spenser, timidly drawn aside from the excesses of"
2448,III.,"buoyant life around. In the days of the semi-atheist dramatists, all"
2449,III.,"flesh and blood and democracy, Spenser steeps himself in Christianity"
2450,III.,"and chivalry, even as Tasso does, following on the fleshly levity and"
2451,III.,"scepticism of Boiardo, Berni, and Ariosto. There is in both poets a"
2452,III.,"paleness, a certain diaphanous weakness, an absence of strong tint or"
2453,III.,"fibre or perfume; in Tasso the pallor of autumn, in Spenser the paleness"
2454,III.,of spring: autumn left sad and leafless by the too voluptuous heat and
2455,III.,"fruitfulness of summer; spring still pale and pinched by winter, with"
2456,III.,"timid nipped grass and unripe stiff buds and catkins, which never"
2457,III.,"suggest the tangle of bush, grasses, and magnificent flowers and fruits,"
2458,III.,"sweet, splendid, or poisonous, which the sun will make out of them. The"
2459,III.,"Renaissance, in the past for Tasso, in the proximate and very visible"
2460,III.,"future for Spenser, has frightened both; the cynicism and bestiality of"
2461,III.,"men like Machiavelli and Aretino; the godless, muscular lustiness of"
2462,III.,"Marlowe, Greene, and Peele, seen in a glimpse by Tasso and Spenser, have"
2463,III.,"given a shock to their sensitive nature, have made them turn away and"
2464,III.,hide themselves from a second sight of it. They both take refuge in a
2465,III.,"land of fiction, of romance, from the realities into which they dread to"
2466,III.,"splash; a world unsubstantial, diaphanous, faint-hued, almost"
2467,III.,"passionless, which they make out of beauty and heroism and purity, which"
2468,III.,"they alembicize and refine, but into which there never enters any vital"
2469,III.,"element, anything to give it flesh and bone and pulsing life: it is a"
2470,III.,"mere soap bubble. And beautiful as is this world of their own making, it"
2471,III.,"is too negative even for them; they move in it only in imagination,"
2472,III.,"calm, serene, vacant, almost sad. There is in it, and in themselves, a"
2473,III.,something wanting; and the remembrance of that unholy-life of reality
2474,III.,"which jostled and splashed their delicate souls, comes back and haunts"
2475,III.,"them with its evil thought. There is no laugh--what is worse, no smile"
2476,III.,"--in these men. Incipient puritanism, not yet the terrible brawny"
2477,III.,"reality of Bunyan, but a vague, grey spectre, haunts Spenser; and the"
2478,III.,"puritanism of Don Quixote, the vague, melancholy, fantastic reverting"
2479,III.,"from the evil world of to-day to an impossible world of chivalry, is"
2480,III.,"troubling the sight of Tasso. He cannot go crazy like Don Quixote, and"
2481,III.,instead he grows melancholy; he cannot believe in his own ideals; he
2482,III.,"cannot give them life, any more than can Spenser give life to his"
2483,III.,"allegoric knights and ladies, because the life would have to be fetched"
2484,III.,"by Tasso out of the flesh of Ariosto, and by Spenser out of the blood of"
2485,III.,Marlowe; and both Tasso and Spenser shrink at the thought of what might
2486,III.,with it be inoculated or transfused; and they rest satisfied with
2487,III.,phantoms. The phantoms of Spenser are more shadowy much more utterly
2488,III.,"devoid of human character; they are almost metaphysical abstractions,"
2489,III.,and they do not therefore sadden us: they are too unlike living things
2490,III.,"to seem very lifeless. But the phantoms of Tasso, he would fain make"
2491,III.,"realities; he works at every detail of character, history, or geography,"
2492,III.,"which may make his people real; they are not, as with Spenser, elves and"
2493,III.,"wizards flitting about in a nameless fairyland, characterless and"
2494,III.,"passionless; they are historical creatures, captains and soldiers in a"
2495,III.,country mapped out by the geographer; but they are phantoms all the more
2496,III.,"melancholy, these beautiful and heroic Clorindas and Erminias and"
2497,III.,Tancreds and Godfreys--why? because the real world around Tasso is
2498,III.,"peopled with Brachianos and Corombonas, and Annabellas and Giovannis,"
2499,III.,"creatures for Webster and Ford; and because this world of chivalry is,"
2500,III.,"in his Italy, as false as the world of Amadis and Esplandian in Toboso"
2501,III.,"and Barcelona for poor Don Quixote. Melancholy therefore, and dreamy,"
2502,III.,"both Tasso and Spenser, with nothing they can fully love in reality,"
2503,III.,because they see it tainted with reality and evil; without the cheerful
2504,III.,"falling back upon everyday life of Ariosto and Shakespeare, and with a"
2505,III.,"strange fancy for fairyland, for the distant, for the Happy Islands, the"
2506,III.,"St. Brandan's Isles, the country of the fountain of youth, the country"
2507,III.,of which vague reports have come back with the ships of Raleigh and
2508,III.,"Ponce de Leon. Tasso and Spenser are happiest, in their calm, melancholy"
2509,III.,"way, when they can let themselves go in day-dreams, and talk of things"
2510,III.,"in which they do not believe, of diamond shields which stun monsters of"
2511,III.,ointments which cure all ills of body and of soul of enchanted groves
2512,III.,"whose trees sound with voices, and lutes, of boats in which, steered by"
2513,III.,"fairies, we can glide across the scarcely rippled summer sea, and"
2514,III.,"watching the ruins of the past, time and reality left behind, set sail"
2515,III.,for some strange land of bliss. And there is in the very sensuousness
2516,III.,"and love of beauty-of these men a vagueness and melancholy, a constant:"
2517,III.,"sense of the fleeting and of the eternal, as in that passage, translated"
2518,III.,"from the languidly sweet Italian perfection of Tasso into the timid,"
2519,III.,"almost scentless, English of Spenser--""Cosi trapassa al trapassar d'un"

2536,III.,"A sense of evanescence, of dreamlikeness, quite different from the"
2537,III.,"thoughtless enjoyment of Boiardo, from the bold and manly facing of the"
2538,III.,"future, the solemn, strong sense of life and death as of waking"
2539,III.,"realities, of the Elizabethan dramatists, even of weaklings like"
2540,III.,Massinger and Beaumont. In Tasso and in Spenser there is no such
2541,III.,"joyousness, no such solemnity; only a dreamy watching, a regret which is"
2542,III.,"scarcely a regret, at the evanescence of pale beauty and pale life, of"
2543,III.,joys feebly felt and evils meekly borne.
2544,III.,
2545,III.,"With Tasso and Spenser comes to a close the school of Boiardo, the small"
2546,III.,number of real artists who finally gave an enduring and beautiful shape
2547,III.,to that strangely mixed and altered material of romantic epic left
2548,III.,behind by the Middle Ages; comes to an end at least till our own day of
2549,III.,appreciative and deliberate imitation and selection and rearrangement of
2550,III.,the artistic forms of the past. Until the revival (after much study and
2551,III.,criticism) by our own poets of Arthur and Gudrun and the Fortunate
2552,III.,"Isles, the world had had enough of mediæval romance. Chivalry had"
2553,III.,avowedly ended in chamberlainry; the devotion to women in the official
2554,III.,routine of the _cicisbeo_; the last romance to which the late
2555,III.,"Renaissance had clung, which made it sympathize with Huon, Ogier,"
2556,III.,"Orlando, and Rinaldo, which had made it take delight still in the"
2557,III.,"fairyland of Oberon, of Fallerina, of Alcina, of Armida, of Acrasia, the"
2558,III.,"romance of the new world, had also turned into prose, prose of"
2559,III.,blood-stained filth. The humanistic and rationalistic men of the
2560,III.,Renaissance had doubtless early begun to turn up their noses in dainty
2561,III.,"dilettantism or scientific contempt, at what were later to be called by"
2562,III.,"Montaigne, ""Ces Lancelots du Lac, ces Amadis, ces Huons et tels fatras"
2563,III.,"di livres à quoy l'enfance s'amuse;"" and by Ben Jonson:"
2564,III.,
2565,III.,
2566,III.,"Public nothings,"
2567,III.,"Abortives of the fabulous dark cloister,"
2568,III.,"Sent out to poison courts, and infect manners--"
2569,III.,
2570,III.,
2571,III.,"the public at large was more constant, and still retained a love for"
2572,III.,"mediæval romance. But more than humanities, more than scientific"
2573,III.,"scepticism and religious puritanism, did the slow dispelling of the"
2574,III.,illusion of Eldorado and the Fortunate Isles. Mankind set sail for
2575,III.,"America in brilliant and knightly gear, believing in fountains of youth"
2576,III.,"and St. Brandan's Isles, with Ariosto, Tasso, and Spenser still in its"
2577,III.,pockets. It returns from America either as the tattered fever-stricken
2578,III.,"ruffian, or as the vulgar, fat upstart of Spanish comedy, returns"
2579,III.,"without honour or shame, holding money (and next to money, negroes) of"
2580,III.,greater account than any insignia of paladinship or the Round Table; it
2581,III.,"is brutal, vulgar, cynical; at best very sad, and it gets written for"
2582,III.,"its delectation the comic-tragic novels of rapscallions, panders,"
2583,III.,"prostitutes, and card-sharpers, which from ""Lazarillo de Tormes"" to ""Gil"
2584,III.,"Blas,"" and from ""Gil Blas"" to ""Tom Jones,"" finally replace the romances"
2585,III.,"of the Launcelots, Galahads, Rinaldos, and Orlandos."
2586,III.,
2587,III.,
2588,III.,
2589,III.,"Thus did the mediæval romantic-epic stuffs suffer alteration,"
2590,III.,"adulteration, and loss of character, throughout the long period of the"
2591,III.,"Middle Ages, without ever receiving an artistic shape, such as should"
2592,III.,make all men preserve and cherish them for the only thing which makes
2593,III.,"men preserve and cherish such things--that never to be wasted quality,"
2594,III.,beauty. The Middle Ages were powerless to endow therewith their own
2595,III.,"subjects; so the subjects had to wait, altering more and more with every"
2596,III.,"passing day, till the coming of the Renaissance. And by that time these"
2597,III.,subjects had ceased to have any serious meaning whatever; the Roland of
2598,III.,the song of Roncevaux had become the crazy Orlando of Ariosto; the
2599,III.,"Renaud of ""The Quatre Fils Aymon,"" had become the Rinaldo, thrashed with"
2600,III.,"sheaves of lilies by Cupid, of Matteo Boiardo. The Renaissance took up"
2601,III.,the old epic-romantic materials and made out of them works of art; but
2602,III.,"works of art which, as I said before, were playthings gets written for"
2603,III.,"its delectation the comic-tragic novels of rapscallions, panders,"
2604,III.,"prostitutes, and card-sharpers, which, from ""Lazarillo de Tormes"" to"

2616,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"On laying down the ""Vita Nuova"" our soul is at first filled and"

2618,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"noble loving may lurk within ourselves, have been awakened by the solemn"
2619,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"music of this book, and have sung in unison with Dante's love till we"
2620,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,have ceased to hear the voice of his passion and have heard only the
2621,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"voice of our own. When the excitement has diminished, when we have grown"
2622,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,able to separate from our own feelings the feelings of the man dead
2623,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"these five centuries and a half, and to realize the strangeness, the"
2624,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,obsoleteness of this love which for a moment had seemed our love; then a
2625,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"new phase of impressions has set in, and the ""Vita Nuova"" inspires us"
2626,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,with mere passionate awe: awe before this passion which we feel to be no
2627,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"longer our own, but far above and distant from us, as in some rarer"
2628,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"stratum of atmosphere; awe before this woman who creates it, or rather"
2629,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,who is its creation. Even as Dante fancied that the people of Florence
2630,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"did when the bodily presence of this lady came across their path, so do"
2631,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,we cast down our glance as the image of Beatrice passes across our mind.

2635,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"though Dante tells us nothing of stature, features, eyes or hair, we"
2636,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"seem to recognize a likeness to her on whose passage ""ogni lingua divien"
2637,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"tremando muta, e gli occhi non ardiscon di guardare."" Passion like this,"
2638,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"to paraphrase a line of Rossetti's, is genius; and it arouses in such as"
2639,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"look upon it the peculiar sense of wonder and love, of awe-stricken"
2640,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"raising up of him who contemplates, which accompanies the contemplation"
2641,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,of genius.
2642,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,
2643,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"But it may be that one day we feel, instead of this, wonder indeed, but"

2646,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"mere thinking on the beloved one, will strike us with the cold and"
2647,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"barren glitter of the miraculous. This Beatrice, as we gaze on her, will"
2648,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,prove to be no reality of flesh and blood like ourselves; she is a form
2649,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"modelled in the semblance of that real, living woman who died six"
2650,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"centuries ago, but the substance of which is the white fire of Dante's"
2651,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,love. And the thought will arise that this purely intellectual love of a
2652,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,scarce-noticed youth for a scarce-known woman is a thing which does not
2653,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"belong to life, neither sweetening nor ennobling any of its real"
2654,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"relations; that it is, in its dazzling purity and whiteness, in fact a"
2655,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"mere strange and sterile death light, such as could not and should not,"
2656,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"in this world of ours, exist twice over. And, lest we should ever be"
2657,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,tempted to think of this ideal love for Beatrice as of a wonderful and
2658,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"beautiful, but scarcely natural or useful phenomenon, I would wish to"
2659,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,study the story of its origin and its influence. I would wish to show
2660,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"that had it not burned thus strangely concentrated and pure, the poets"
2661,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,of succeeding ages could not have taken from that white flame of love
2662,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"which Dante set alight upon the grave of Beatrice, the spark of ideal"
2663,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"passion which has, in the noblest of our literature, made the desire of"
2664,MEDIEVAL LOVE.,"man for woman and of woman for man burn clear towards heaven, leaving"

2680,I.,"literature as one of two things: the wife or the mistress. The wife,"
2681,I.,"Penelope, Andromache, Alkestis, nay, even the charming young bride in"
2682,I.,"Xenophon's ""Oeconomics,"" is, while excluded from many concerns,"
2683,I.,distinctly reverenced and loved in her own household capacity; but the
2684,I.,reverence is of the sort which the man feels for his parents and his
2685,I.,"household gods, and the affection is calm and gently rebuking like that"
2686,I.,"for his children. The mistress, on the other hand, is the object of"
2687,I.,"passion which is often very vehement, but which is always either simply"
2688,I.,"fleshly or merely fancifully æsthetic or both, and which entirely"
2689,I.,precludes any save a degrading influence upon the sensual and suspicious
2690,I.,"lover. Even Tibullus, in love matters one of the most modern among the"
2691,I.,"ancients, and capable of painting many charming and delicate little"
2692,I.,"domestic idyls even in connection with a mere bought mistress, is"
2693,I.,"perpetually accusing his Delia of selling herself to a higher bidder,"
2694,I.,and sighing at the high probability of her abandoning him for the
2695,I.,Illyrian prætor or some other rich amateur of pretty women. The
2696,I.,"barbarous North--whose songs have come down to us either, like the"
2697,I.,"Volsunga Saga translated by Mr. Morris, in an original pagan version, or"
2698,I.,"else, as the Nibelungenlied, recast during the early Middle Ages--the"
2699,I.,"North tells us nothing of the venal paramour, but knows nothing also"
2700,I.,beyond the wedded wife; more independent and mighty perhaps than her
2701,I.,"counterpart of classical Antiquity, but although often bought, like"
2702,I.,"Brynhilt or Gudrun, at the expense of tremendous adventures, cherished"
2703,I.,"scarcely more passionately than the wives of Odysseus and Hector. Thus,"
2704,I.,"before the Middle Ages, there existed as a rule only a holy, but"
2705,I.,"indifferent and utterly unlyrical, love for the women, the equals of"
2706,I.,"their husbands, wooed usually of the family and solemnly given in"
2707,I.,marriage without much consultation of their wishes; and a highly
2708,I.,"passionate and singing, but completely profligate and debasing, desire"
2709,I.,for mercenary though cultivated creatures like the Delias and Cynthlas
2710,I.,"of Tibullus and Propertius, or highborn women, descended, like Catullus'"
2711,I.,"Lesbia, in brazen dishonour to their level, women towards whom there"
2712,I.,could not possibly exist on the part of their lovers any sense of
2713,I.,"equality, much less of inferiority. To these two kinds of love, chaste"
2714,I.,"but cold, and passionate but unchaste, the Middle Ages added, or rather"
2715,I.,"opposed, a new manner of loving, which, although a mere passing"
2716,I.,"phenomenon, has left the clearest traces throughout our whole mode of"
2717,I.,feeling and writing.
2718,I.,
2719,I.,"To describe mediæval love is a difficult matter, and to describe it"
2720,I.,except in negations is next to impossibility. I conceive it to consist
2721,I.,"in a certain sentimental, romantic, idealistic attitude towards women,"
2722,I.,not by any means incompatible however with the grossest animalism; an
2723,I.,"attitude presupposing a complete moral, æsthetical, and social"
2724,I.,"superiority on the part of the whole sex, inspiring the very highest"
2725,I.,respect and admiration independently of the individual's qualities; and
2726,I.,"reaching the point of actual worship, varying from the adoration of a"
2727,I.,"queen by a courtier to the adoration of a shrine by a pilgrim, in the"
2728,I.,case of the one particular lady who happens to be the beloved; an
2729,I.,attitude in the relations of the sexes which results in love becoming an
2730,I.,"indispensable part of a noble life, and the devoted attachment to one"
2731,I.,"individual woman, a necessary requisite of a gentlemanly training."
2732,I.,
2733,I.,"Mediæval love is not merely a passion, a desire, an affection, a habit;"
2734,I.,"it is a perfect occupation. It absorbs, or is supposed to absorb, the"
2735,I.,Individual; it permeates his life like a religion. It is not one of the
2736,I.,"interests of life, or, rather, one of life's phases; it is the whole of"
2737,I.,"life, all other interests and actions either sinking into an unsingable"
2738,I.,"region below it, or merely embroidering a variegated pattern upon its"
2739,I.,"golden background. Mediæval love, therefore, never obtains its object,"
2740,I.,"however much it may obtain the woman; for the object of mediæval love,"
2741,I.,"as of mediæval religious mysticism, is not one particular act or series"
2742,I.,"of acts, but is its own exercise, of which the various incidents of the"
2743,I.,drama between man and woman are merely so many results. It has not its
2744,I.,"definite stages, like the love of the men of classical Antiquity or the"
2745,I.,"heroic time of the North: its stages of seeking, obtaining, cherishing,"
2746,I.,"guarding; it is always at the same point, always in the same condition"
2747,I.,"of half-religious, half-courtier-like adoration, whether it be"
2748,I.,triumphantly successful or sighingly despairing. The man and the
2749,I.,"woman--or rather, I should say, the knight and the lady, for mediæval"
2750,I.,"love is an aristocratic privilege, and the love of lower folk is not a"
2751,I.,"theme for song--the knight and the lady, therefore, seem always, however"
2752,I.,"knit together by habit, nay, by inextricable meshes of guilt, somehow at"
2753,I.,the same distance from one another. Once they have seen and loved each
2754,I.,"other, their passion burns on always evenly, burns on (at least"
2755,I.,theoretically) to all eternity. It seems almost as if the woman were a
2756,I.,"mere shrine, a mysterious receptacle of the ineffable, a grail cup, a"
2757,I.,"consecrated wafer, but not the ineffable itself. For there is always in"
2758,I.,"mediæval love, however fleshly the incidents which it produces, a"
2759,I.,"certain Platonic element; that is to say, a craving for, a pursuit of,"
2760,I.,something which is an abstraction; an abstraction impossible to define
2761,I.,"in its constant shifting and shimmering, and which seems at one moment a"
2762,I.,"social standard, a religious ideal, or both, and which merges for ever"
2763,I.,"in the dazzling, vague sheen of the Eternal Feminine. Hence, one of the"
2764,I.,"most distinctive features of mediæval love, an extraordinary sameness of"
2765,I.,"intonation, making it difficult to distinguish between the _bonâ fide_"
2766,I.,"passion for which a man risks life and honour, and the mere"
2767,I.,conventional gallantry of the knight who sticks a lady's glove on his
2768,I.,"helmet as a compliment to her rank; nay, between the impure adoration of"
2769,I.,"an adulterous lamia like Yseult, and the mystical adoration of a"
2770,I.,"glorified Mother of God; for both are women, both are ladies, and"
2771,I.,"therefore the greatest poet of the early Middle Ages, Gottfried von"
2772,I.,"Strassburg, sings them both with the same religious respect, and the"
2773,I.,same hysterical rapture. This mediæval love is furthermore a
2774,I.,"deliberately expected, sought-for, and received necessity in a man's"
2775,I.,"life; it is not an accident, much less an incidental occurrence to be"
2776,I.,lightly taken or possibly avoided: it is absolutely indispensable to
2777,I.,"man's social training, to his moral and æsthetical self-improvement; it"
2778,I.,"is part and parcel of manhood and knighthood. Hence, where it does not"
2779,I.,"arise of itself (and where a man is full of the notion of such love, it"
2780,I.,is rare that it does not come but too soon) it has to be sought for.
2781,I.,"Ulrich von Liechtenstein, in his curious autobiography written late in"
2782,I.,"the twelfth century, relates how ever since his childhood he had been"
2783,I.,aware of the necessity of the loyal love service of a lady for the
2784,I.,"accomplishment of knightly duties; and how, as soon as he was old enough"
2785,I.,"to love, he looked around him for a lady whom he might serve; a"
2786,I.,proceeding renewed in more prosaic days and with a curious pedantic
2787,I.,"smack, by Lorenzo dei Medici; and then again, perhaps for the last time,"
2788,I.,"by the Knight of La Mancha, in that memorable discussion which ended in"
2789,I.,the enthronement as his heart's queen of the unrivalled Dulcinea of
2790,I.,"Toboso. _Frowendienst,_ ""lady's service,"" is the name given by Ulrich"
2791,I.,"von Liechtenstein, a mediæval Quixote, outshining by far the mad"
2792,I.,"Provençals Rudel and Vidal, to the memoirs very delightfully done into"
2793,I.,"modern German by Ludwig Tieck; and ""lady's service"" is the highest"
2794,I.,"occupation of knightly leisure, the subject of the immense bulk of"
2795,I.,"mediæval poetry. ""Lady's service"" in deeds of arms and song, in constant"
2796,I.,"praise and defence of the beloved, in heroic enterprise and madcap"
2797,I.,"mummery, in submission and terror to the wondrous creature whom the"
2798,I.,"humble servant, the lover, never calls by her sacred name, speaking of"
2799,I.,"her in words unknown to Antiquity, _dompna, dame, frowe, madonna_--words"
2800,I.,"of which the original sense has almost been forgotten, although there"
2801,I.,cleave to them even now ideas higher than those associated with the
2802,I.,"_puella_ of the ancients, the _wib_ of the heroic days--lady,"
2803,I.,"mistress--the titles of the Mother of God, who is, after all, only the"
2804,I.,"mystical Soul's Paramour of the mediæval world. ""Lady's service""--the"
2805,I.,"almost technical word, expressing the position, half-serf-like,"
2806,I.,"half-religious, the bonds of complete humility and never-ending"
2807,I.,"faithfulness, the hopes of reward, the patience under displeasure, the"
2808,I.,"pride in the livery of servitude, the utter absorption of the life of"
2809,I.,"one individual in the life of another; which constitute in Provence, in"
2810,I.,"France, in Germany, in England, in Italy, in the fabulous kingdoms of"
2811,I.,"Arthur and Charlemagne, the strange new thing which I have named"
2812,I.,Mediæval Love.
2813,I.,
2814,I.,Has such a thing really existed? Are not these mediæval poets leagued
2815,I.,together in a huge conspiracy to deceive us? Is it possible that strong
2816,I.,"men have wept and fainted at a mere woman's name, like the Count of"
2817,I.,"Nevers in ""Flamenca,"" or that their mind has swooned away in months of"
2818,I.,reverie like that of Parzifal in Eschenbach's poem; that worldly wise
2819,I.,and witty men have shipped off and died on sea for love of an unseen
2820,I.,woman like Jaufre Rudel; or dressed in wolf's hide and lurked and fled
2821,I.,before the huntsmen-like Peire Vidal; or mangled their face and cut off
2822,I.,"their finger, and, clothing themselves in rags more frightful than"
2823,I.,"Nessus' robe, mixed in the untouchable band of lepers like Ulrich von"
2824,I.,Liechtenstein? Is it possible to believe that the insane enterprises of
2825,I.,"the Amadises, Lisvarts and Felixmartes of late mediæval romance, that"
2826,I.,"the behaviour of Don Quixote in the Sierra Morena, ever had any serious"
2827,I.,"models in reality? Nay, more difficult still to believe--because the"
2828,I.,whole madness of individuals is more credible than the half-madness of
2829,I.,"the whole world--is it possible to believe that, as the poems of"
2830,I.,"innumerable trouvères and troubadours, minnesingers and Italian poets,"
2831,I.,"as the legion of mediæval romances of the cycles of Charlemagne, Arthur,"
2832,I.,"and Amadis would have it, that during so long a period of time society"
2833,I.,"could have been enthralled by this hysterical, visionary, artificial,"
2834,I.,incredible religion of mediæval love? It is at once too grotesque and
2835,I.,"too beautiful, too high and too low, to be credible; and our first"
2836,I.,"impulse, on closing the catechisms and breviaries, the legendaries and"
2837,I.,"hymn-books of this strange new creed, is to protest that the love poems"
2838,I.,"must be allegories, the love romances solar myths, the Courts of Love"
2839,I.,"historical bungles; that all this mediæval world of love is a figment, a"
2840,I.,"misinterpretation, a falsehood."
2841,I.,
2842,I.,"But if we seek more than a mere casual impression; if, instead of"
2843,I.,"feeling sceptical over one or two fragments of evidence, we attempt to"
2844,I.,collect the largest possible number of facts together; if we read not
2845,I.,"one mediæval love story, but twenty--not half a dozen mediæval love"
2846,I.,"poems, but several scores; if we really investigate into the origin of"
2847,I.,"the apparent myth, the case speedily alters. Little by little this which"
2848,I.,"had been inconceivable becomes not merely intelligible, but inevitable;"
2849,I.,the myth becomes an historical phenomenon of the most obvious and
2850,I.,"necessary sort. Mediæval love, which had seemed to us a poetic fiction,"
2851,I.,"is turned into a reality; and a reality, alas, which is prosaic. Let us"
2852,I.,look at it.
2853,I.,
2854,I.,Mediæval love is first revealed in the sudden and almost simultaneous
2855,I.,"burst of song which, like the twitter and trill so dear to trouvères,"
2856,I.,"troubadours, and minnesingers, fills the woods that yesterday were"
2857,I.,"silent and dead, and greeted the earliest sunshine, the earliest faint"
2858,I.,"green after the long winter numbness of the dark ages, after the"
2859,I.,boisterous gales of the earliest Crusade. The French and Provençals
2860,I.,"sang first, the Germans later, the Sicilians last; but although we may"
2861,I.,"say after deliberate analysis, such or such a form, or such or such a"
2862,I.,"story, was known in this country before it appeared in that one, such"
2863,I.,"imitation or suggestion was so rapid that with regard to the French, the"
2864,I.,"Provençals, and the Germans at least, the impression is simultaneous;"
2865,I.,"only the Sicilians beginning distinctly later, forerunners of the new"
2866,I.,"love lyric, wholly different from that of trouvères, troubadours, and"
2867,I.,"minnesingers, of the Italians of the latter thirteenth century. And this"
2868,I.,simultaneous revelation of mediæval love takes place in the last quarter
2869,I.,"of the twelfth century, when Northern France had already consolidated"
2870,I.,"into a powerful monarchy, and Paris, after the teachings of Abélard, was"
2871,I.,recognized as the intellectual metropolis of Europe; when south of the
2872,I.,Loire the brilliant Angevine kings held the overlordship of the cultured
2873,I.,Raymonds of Toulouse and of the reviving Latin municipalities of
2874,I.,Provence \ when Germany was welded as a compact feudal mass by the most
2875,I.,powerful of the Stauffens; and the papacy had been built up by Gregory
2876,I.,and Alexander into a political wall against which Frederick and Henry
2877,I.,"vainly battered; when the Italian commonwealths grew slowly but surely,"
2878,I.,as yet still far from guessing that the day would come when their
2879,I.,democracy should produce a new civilization to supersede this triumphant
2880,I.,"mediæval civilization of the early Capetiens, the Angevines, and the"
2881,I.,Hohenstauffens. Europe was setting forth once more for the East; but no
2882,I.,longer as the ignorant and enthusiastic hordes of Peter the Hermit: Asia
2883,I.,"was the great field for adventure, the great teacher of new luxuries, at"
2884,I.,once the Eldorado and the grand tour of all the brilliant and
2885,I.,"inquisitive and unscrupulous chivalry of the day. And, while into the"
2886,I.,West were insidiously entering habits and modes of thought of the East;
2887,I.,"throughout Germany and Provence, and throughout the still obscure free"
2888,I.,"burghs of Italy, was spreading the first indication of that emotional"
2889,I.,"mysticism which, twenty or thirty years later, was to burst out in the"
2890,I.,frenzy of spiritual love of St. Francis and his followers. The moment is
2891,I.,one of the most remarkable in all history: the premature promise in the
2892,I.,twelfth century of that intellectual revival which was delayed
2893,I.,throughout Northern Europe until the sixteenth. It is the moment when
2894,I.,"society settled down, after the anarchy of eight hundred years, on its"
2895,I.,"feudal basis; a basis fallaciously solid, and in whose presence no one"
2896,I.,might guess that the true and definitive Renaissance would arise out of
2897,I.,the democratic civilization of Italy.
2898,I.,
2899,I.,Such is the moment when we first hear the almost universal song of
2900,I.,mediæval love. This song comes from the triumphantly reorganized portion
2901,I.,"of society, not from the part which is slowly working its way to"
2902,I.,"reorganization; not from the timidly encroaching burghers, but from the"
2903,I.,"nobles. The reign of town poetry, of fabliaux and meistersang, comes"
2904,I.,"later; the poets of the early Middle Ages, trouvères, troubadours, and"
2905,I.,"minnesingers are, with barely one or two exceptions, all knights. And"
2906,I.,"their song comes from the castle. Now, in order to understand mediæval"
2907,I.,"love, we must reflect for a moment upon this feudal castle, and upon the"
2908,I.,kind of life which the love poets of the late twelfth and early
2909,I.,"thirteenth century--whether lords like Bertram de Born, and Guillaume de"
2910,I.,"Poitiers, among the troubadours; the Vidame de Chartres, Meurisses de"
2911,I.,"Craon, and the Duke of Brabant among the trouvères of Northern France;"
2912,I.,like Ulrich von Liechtenstein among the minnesingers; or retainers and
2913,I.,"hangers-on like Bernard de Ventadour and Armand de Mareulh, like"
2914,I.,"Chrestiens de Troyes, Gaisses Brulez, or Quienes de Béthune, like"
2915,I.,"Walther, Wolfram, and Tannhäuser--great or small, good or bad, saw"
2916,I.,before them and mixed with in that castle. The castle of a great
2917,I.,"feudatory of the early Middle Ages, whether north or south of the Loire,"
2918,I.,"in Austria or in Franconia, is like a miniature copy of some garrison"
2919,I.,town in barbarous countries: there is an enormous numerical
2920,I.,"preponderance of men over women; for only the chiefs in command, the"
2921,I.,"overlord, and perhaps one or two of his principal kinsmen or adjutants,"
2922,I.,are permitted the luxury of a wife; the rest of the gentlemen are
2923,I.,"subalterns, younger sons without means, youths sent to learn their"
2924,I.,military duty and the ways of the world: a whole pack of men without
2925,I.,"wives, without homes, and usually without fortune. High above all this"
2926,I.,"deferential male crowd, moves the lady of the castle: highborn, proud,"
2927,I.,"having brought her husband a dower of fiefs often equal to his own, and"
2928,I.,of vassals devoted to her race. About her she has no equals; her
2929,I.,"daughters, scarcely out of the nurse's hands, are given away in"
2930,I.,"marriage; and her companions, if companions they may be called, are the"
2931,I.,"waiting ladies, poor gentlewomen situated between the maid of honour and"
2932,I.,"the ladies' maid, like that Brangwaine whom Yseult sacrifices to her"
2933,I.,"intrigue with Tristram, or those damsels whom Flamenca gives over to the"
2934,I.,"squires of her lover Guillems; at best, the wife of one of her husband's"
2935,I.,"subalterns, or some sister or aunt or widow kept by charity. Round this"
2936,I.,"lady--the stately, proud lady perpetually described by mediæval"
2937,I.,"poets--flutters the swarm of young men, all day long, in her path:"
2938,I.,"serving her at meals, guarding her apartments, nay, as pages, admitted"
2939,I.,even into her most secret chamber; meeting her for ever in the
2940,I.,"narrowness of that castle life, where every unnecessary woman is a"
2941,I.,"burden usurping the place of a soldier, and, if possible, replaced by a"
2942,I.,"man. Servants, lacqueys, and enjoying the privileges of ubiquity of"
2943,I.,"lacqueys, yet, at the same time, men of good birth and high breeding,"
2944,I.,"good at the sword and at the lute; bound to amuse this highborn woman,"
2945,I.,"fading away in the monotony of feudal life, with few books to read or"
2946,I.,"unable to read them, and far above all the household concerns which"
2947,I.,"devolve on the butler, the cellarer, the steward, the gentleman,"
2948,I.,"honourably employed as a servant. To them, to these young men, with few"
2949,I.,"or no young women of their own age to associate, and absolutely no"
2950,I.,"unmarried girls who could be a desirable match, the lady of the castle"
2951,I.,"speedily becomes a goddess, the impersonation at once of that feudal"
2952,I.,"superiority before which they bow, of that social perfection which they"
2953,I.,"are commanded to seek, and of that womankind of which the castle affords"
2954,I.,"so few examples. To please her, this lazy, bored, highbred woman, with"
2955,I.,"all the squeamishness and caprice of high birth and laziness about her,"
2956,I.,"becomes their ideal; to be favourably noticed, their highest glory; to"
2957,I.,"be loved, these wretched mortals, by this divinity--that thought must"
2958,I.,often pass through their brain and terrify them with its delicious
2959,I.,"audacity; oh no, such a thing is not possible. But it is. The lady at"
2960,I.,"first, perhaps most often, singles out as a pastime some young knight,"
2961,I.,"some squire, some page; and, in a half-queenly, half-motherly way,"
2962,I.,"corrects, rebukes his deficiencies, undertakes to teach him his duty as"
2963,I.,"a servant. The romance of the ""Petit Jehan de Saintre,"" written in the"
2964,I.,"fifteenth century, but telling, with a delicacy of cynicism worthy of"
2965,I.,"Balzac, what must have been the old, old story of the whole feudal"
2966,I.,"Middle Ages, shows the manner in which, while feeling that he is being"
2967,I.,"trained to knightly courtesy and honour, the young man in the service of"
2968,I.,"a great feudal lady is gradually taught dissimulation, lying, intrigue;"
2969,I.,is initiated by the woman who looms above him like a saint into all the
2970,I.,"foulness of adultery. Adultery; a very ugly word, which must strike"
2971,I.,almost like a handful of mud in the face whosoever has approached this
2972,I.,subject of mediæval love in admiration of its strange delicacy and
2973,I.,"enthusiasm. Yet it is a word which must be spoken, for in it is the"
2974,I.,explanation of the whole origin and character of this passion which
2975,I.,"burst into song in the early Middle Ages. This almost religious love,"
2976,I.,this love which conceives no higher honour than the service of the
2977,I.,"beloved, no higher virtue than eternal fidelity--this love is the love"
2978,I.,"for another man's wife. Between unmarried young men and young women,"
2979,I.,kept carefully apart by the system which gives away a girl without her
2980,I.,"consent and only to a rich suitor, there is no possibility of love in"
2981,I.,"these early feudal courts; the amours, however licentious, between"
2982,I.,"kings' daughters and brave knights, of the Carolingian tales, belong to"
2983,I.,"a different rank of society, to the prose romances made up in the"
2984,I.,"fourteenth century for the burgesses of cities; the intrigues, ending in"
2985,I.,"marriage, of the princes and princesses of the cycle of Amadis, belong"
2986,I.,"to a different period, to the fifteenth century, and to courts where"
2987,I.,"feudal society scarcely exists; the squires, the young knights who hang"
2988,I.,about a great baronial establishment of the twelfth and thirteenth
2989,I.,"centuries, have still to make their fortune, and do not dream of"
2990,I.,"marriage. The husband, on the other hand, the great lord or successful"
2991,I.,"knightly adventurer, married late in life, and married from the"
2992,I.,"necessity, for ever pressing upon the feudal proprietor, of adding on"
2993,I.,"new fiefs and new immunities, of increasing his importance and"
2994,I.,independence in proportion to the hourly increasing strength and claims
2995,I.,"of the overlord, the king, who casts covetous eyes upon him--the husband"
2996,I.,has not married for love; he has had his love affairs with the wives of
2997,I.,"other men in his day, or may still have them; this lady is a mere feudal"
2998,I.,"necessity, she is required to give him a dower and give him an heir,"
2999,I.,"that is all. If the husband does not love, how much less can the wife;"
3000,I.,"married, as she is, scarce knowing what marriage is, to a man much older"
3001,I.,"than herself, whom most probably she has never seen, to whom she is a"
3002,I.,"mere investment. Nay, there is not even the after-marriage love of the"
3003,I.,"ancients: this wife is not the housekeeper, the woman who works that the"
3004,I.,man's house may be rich and decorous; not even the nurse of his
3005,I.,"children, for the children are speedily given over to the squires and"
3006,I.,"duennas; she is the woman of another family who has come into his, the"
3007,I.,"stranger who must be respected (as that most typical mediæval wife,"
3008,I.,"Eleanor of Guienne, was respected by her husbands) on account of her"
3009,I.,"fiefs, her vassals, her kinsfolk; but who cannot be loved. Can there be"
3010,I.,love between man and wife? There cannot be love between man and wife.
3011,I.,"This is no answer of mine, fantastically deduced from mediæval poetry."
3012,I.,It is the answer solemnly made to the solemnly asked question by the
3013,I.,"Court of Love held by the Countess of Champagne in 1174, and registered"
3014,I.,"by Master Andrew the King of France's chaplain: ""Dicimus enim et"
3015,I.,stabilito tenore firmamus amorem non posse inter duos jugales suas
3016,I.,"extendere vires."" And the reason alleged for this judgment brings us"
3017,I.,back to the whole conception of mediæval love as a respectful service
3018,I.,"humbly waiting for a reward: ""For,"" pursues the decision published by"
3019,I.,"André le Chapelain, ""whereas lovers grant to each other favours freely"
3020,I.,"and from no legal necessity, married people have the duty of obeying"
3021,I.,"each other's wishes and of refusing nothing to one another."" ""No love is"
3022,I.,"possible between man and wife,"" repeat the Courts of Love which,"
3023,I.,consisting of all the highborn ladies of the province and presided by
3024,I.,"some mighty queen or princess, represent the social opinions of the day."
3025,I.,"""But this lady,"" says a knight (Miles) before the love tribunal of Queen"
3026,I.,"Eleanor, ""promised to me that if ever she should lose the love of her"
3027,I.,"lover, she would take me in his place. She has wedded the man who was"
3028,I.,"her lover, and I have come to claim fulfilment of her promise."" The"
3029,I.,"court discusses for awhile. ""We cannot,"" answers Queen Eleanor, ""go"
3030,I.,against the Countess of Champagne's decision that love cannot exist
3031,I.,between man and wife. We therefore desire this lady to fulfil her
3032,I.,"promise and give you her love."" Again, there come to the Court of Love"
3033,I.,"of the Viscountess of Narbonne a knight and a lady, who desire to know"
3034,I.,"whether, having been once married, but since divorced, a love engagement"
3035,I.,"between them would be honourable. The viscountess decides that ""Love"
3036,I.,"between those who have been married together, but who have since been"
3037,I.,"divorced from one another, is not to be deemed reprehensible; nay, that"
3038,I.,"it is to be considered as honourable."" And these Courts of Love, be it"
3039,I.,"remarked, were frequently held on occasion of the marriage of great"
3040,I.,"personages; as, for instance, of that between Louis VII. and Eleanor of"
3041,I.,Poitiers in 1137. The poetry of the early Middle Ages follows implicitly
3042,I.,"the decisions of these tribunals, which reveal a state of society to"
3043,I.,which the nearest modern approach is that of Italy in the eighteenth
3044,I.,"century, when, as Goldoni and Parini show us, as Stendhal (whose ""De"
3045,I.,"l'Amour"" may be taken as the modern ""Breviari d'Amor"") expounds, there"
3046,I.,was no impropriety possible as long as a lady was beloved by any one
3047,I.,"except her own husband. No love, therefore, between unmarried people"
3048,I.,"(the cyclical romances, as before stated, and the Amadises, belong to"
3049,I.,"another time of social condition, and the only real exception to my rule"
3050,I.,"of which I can think is the lovely French tale of ""Aucassin et"
3051,I.,"Nicolette""); and no love between man and wife. But love there must be;"
3052,I.,and love there consequently is; love for the married woman from the man
3053,I.,"who is not her husband. The feudal lady, married without being consulted"
3054,I.,"and without having had a chance of knowing what love is, yet lives to"
3055,I.,know love; lives to be taught it by one of these many bachelors bound to
3056,I.,flutter about her in military service or social duty; lives to teach it
3057,I.,"herself. And she is too powerful in her fiefs and kinsmen, too powerful"
3058,I.,"in the public opinion which approves and supports her, to be hampered by"
3059,I.,"her husband. The husband, indeed, has grown up in the same habits, has"
3060,I.,"known, before marrying, the customs sanctioned by the Courts of Love; he"
3061,I.,"has been the knight of some other man's wife in his day, what right has"
3062,I.,"he to object? As in the days of Italian _cecisbei_, the early mediæval"
3063,I.,"lover might say with Goldoni's Don Alfonso or Don Roberto, ""I _serve_"
3064,I.,"your wife--such or such another serves mine, what harm can there be in"
3065,I.,"it?"" (""Io servo vostra moglie, Don Eugenio favorisce la mia; che male c'"
3066,I.,"e?"" I am quoting from memory.) And as a fact, we hear little of"
3067,I.,jealousy; the amusement of En Barral when Peire Vidal came in and kissed
3068,I.,his sleeping wife; and the indignation of all Provence for the murder of
3069,I.,Guillems de Cabestanh (buried in the same tomb with the lady who had
3070,I.,been made to eat of his heart)--showing from opposite sides how the
3071,I.,society accustomed to Courts of Love looked upon the duties of husbands.
3072,I.,
3073,I.,Such was the social life in those feudal courts whence first arises the
3074,I.,"song of mediæval love, and that this is the case is proved by the whole"
3075,I.,"huge body of early mediæval poetry. We must not judge, as I have said,"
3076,I.,"either by poems of much earlier date, like the Nibelungen and the"
3077,I.,"Carolingian _chansons de geste_, which merely received a new form in the"
3078,I.,"early Middle Ages; still less from the prose romances of Mélusine,"
3079,I.,"Milles et Amys, Palemon and Arcite, and a host of others which were"
3080,I.,elaborated only later and under the influence of the quite unfeudal
3081,I.,habits of the great cities; and least of all from that strange late
3082,I.,"southern cycle of the Amadises, from which, odd as it seems, many of our"
3083,I.,"notions of chivalric love have, through our ancestors, through the"
3084,I.,"satirists or burlesque poets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,"
3085,I.,"been inherited. We must look at the tales which, as we are constantly"
3086,I.,"being told by trouvères, troubadours, and minnesingers, were the"
3087,I.,fashionable reading of the feudal classes of the twelfth and thirteenth
3088,I.,centuries: the tales best known to us in the colourless respectability
3089,I.,"of the collection made in the reign of Edward IV. by Sir Thomas Malory,"
3090,I.,"and called by him the ""Morte d'Arthur""--of the ladies and knights of"
3091,I.,Arthur's court; of the quest of the Grail by spotless knights who were
3092,I.,bastards and fathers of bastards; of the intrigues of Tristram of
3093,I.,Lyoness and Queen Yseult; of Launcelot and Guenevere; the tales which
3094,I.,"Francesca and Paolo read together. We must look, above all, at the lyric"
3095,I.,"poetry of France, Provence, Germany, and Sicily in the early Middle"
3096,I.,Ages.
3097,I.,
3098,I.,
3099,I.,Vos qui très bien ameis i petit mentendeis

3103,I.,
3104,I.,
3105,I.,"This strange entreaty to love the maidens for the sake of Christ's love,"
3106,I.,"this protest of a nameless northern French poet (Wackernagel,"
3107,I.,Altfranzösische Lieder and Leiche IX.) against the adulterous passion of
3108,I.,"his contemporaries, comes to us, pathetically enough, solitary, faint,"
3109,I.,"unnoticed in the vast chorus, boundless like the spring song of birds or"
3110,I.,"the sound of the waves, of poets singing the love of other men's wives."
3111,I.,"But, it may be objected--how can we tell that these love songs, so"
3112,I.,"carefully avoiding all mention of names, are not addressed to the"
3113,I.,"desired bride, to the legitimate wife of the poet? For several reasons;"
3114,I.,"and mainly, for the crushing evidence of an undefinable something which"
3115,I.,tells us that they are not. The other reasons are easily stated. We know
3116,I.,that feudal habits would never have allowed to unmarried women (and
3117,I.,women were married when scarcely out of their childhood) the
3118,I.,opportunities for the relations which obviously exist between the poet
3119,I.,"and his lady; and that, if by some accident a young knight might fall in"
3120,I.,"love with a girl, he would address not her but her parents, since the"
3121,I.,"Middle Ages, who were indifferent to adultery, were, like the southern"
3122,I.,"nations among whom the married woman is not expected to be virtuous,"
3123,I.,"extreme sticklers for the purity of their unmarried womankind. Further,"
3124,I.,we have no instance of an unmarried woman being ever addressed during
3125,I.,"the early Middle Ages, in those terms of social respect--_madame,"
3126,I.,"domna, frowe, madonna_--which essentially belong to the mistress of a"
3127,I.,household; nor do these stately names fit in with any theory which would
3128,I.,make us believe that the lady addressed by the poet is the jealously
3129,I.,guarded daughter of the house with whom he is plotting a secret
3130,I.,"marriage, or an elopement to end off in marriage. This is not the way"
3131,I.,"that Romeo speaks to Juliet, nor even that the princesses in the"
3132,I.,cyclical romances and in the Amadises are wooed by their bridegrooms.
3133,I.,"This is not the language of a lover who is broaching his love, and who"
3134,I.,"hopes, however timidly, to consummate it before all the world by"
3135,I.,marriage. It is obviously the language of a man either towards a woman
3136,I.,who is taking a pleasure in keeping him dangling without favours which
3137,I.,she has implicitly or explicitly promised; or towards a woman who is
3138,I.,momentarily withholding favours which her lover has habitually enjoyed.
3139,I.,"And in a large proportion of cases the poems of trouvères, troubadours,"
3140,I.,"and minnesingers are the expression of fortunate love, the fond"
3141,I.,recollection or eager expectation of meetings with the beloved. All this
3142,I.,"can evidently not be connected with the wooing, however stealthy,"
3143,I.,however Romeo-and-Juliet-like of a bride; still less can it be explained
3144,I.,"in reference to love within wedlock. A man does not, however loving,"
3145,I.,worship his wife as his social superior; he does not address her in
3146,I.,titles of stiff respect; he does not sigh and weep and supplicate for
3147,I.,"love which is his due, and remind his wife that she owes it him in"
3148,I.,"return for loyal, humble, discreet service. Above all, a man (except in"
3149,I.,"some absurd comedy perhaps, where the husband, in an age of _cicisbeos_,"
3150,I.,is in love with his own wife and dares not admit it before the society
3151,I.,"which holds ""that there can be no love between married folk "")--a"
3152,I.,"husband, I repeat, does not beg for, arrange, look forward to, and"
3153,I.,"recall with triumph or sadness, secret meetings with his own wife. Now"
3154,I.,"the secret meeting is, in nearly every aristocratic poet of the early"
3155,I.,"poetry, the inevitable result of the humble praises and humble requests"
3156,I.,"for kindness; it is, most obviously, _the_ reward for which the poet is"
3157,I.,"always importuning. Mediæval love poetry, compared with the love poetry"
3158,I.,"of Antiquity and the love poetry of the revival of letters, is, in its"
3159,I.,"lyric form, decidedly chaste; but it is perfectly explicit; and, for all"
3160,I.,"its metaphysical tendencies and its absence of clearly painted pictures,"
3161,I.,the furthest possible removed from being Platonic. One of the most
3162,I.,"important, characteristic, and artistically charming categories of"
3163,I.,mediæval love lyrics is that comprising the Provençal _serena_ and
3164,I.,"_alba,_ with their counterparts in the _langue d'oil_, and the so-called"
3165,I.,_Wachtlieder_ of the minnesingers; and this category of love poetry may
3166,I.,"be defined as the drama, in four acts, of illicit love. The faithful"
3167,I.,"lover has received from his lady an answer to his love, the place and"
3168,I.,hour are appointed; all the day of which the evening is to bring him
3169,I.,"this honour, he goes heavy hearted and sighing: ""Day, much do you grow"
3170,I.,"for my grief, and the evening, the evening and the long hope kills me."""
3171,I.,"Thus far the _serena_, the evening song, of Guiraut Riquier. A lovely"
3172,I.,"anonymous _alba,_ whose refrain, ""Oi deus, oi deus; de l' alba, tan tost"
3173,I.,"ve!"" is familiar to every smatterer of Provençal, shows us the lady and"
3174,I.,"her knight in an orchard beneath the hawthorn, giving and taking the"
3175,I.,"last kisses while the birds sing and the sky whitens with dawn. ""The"
3176,I.,"lady is gracious and pleasant, and many look upon her for her beauty,"
3177,I.,"and her heart Is all in loving loyally; alas, alas, the dawn! how soon"
3178,I.,"it: comes!--"" ""Oi deus, oi deus; de l'alba, tan tost ve!"" The real _alba_"
3179,I.,"is the same as the German _Wachtlieder,_ the song of the squire or"
3180,I.,"friend posted at the garden gate or outside the castle wall, warning the"
3181,I.,"lovers to separate. ""Fair comrade (Bel Companho), I call to you singing."
3182,I.,"'Sleep no more, for I hear the birds announcing the day in the trees,"
3183,I.,and I fear that the jealous one may find you;' and in a moment it will
3184,I.,"be day, 'Bel Companho, come to the window and look at the signs in the"
3185,I.,"sky! you will know me a faithful messenger; if you do it not, it will be"
3186,I.,"to your harm"" and in a moment it will be dawn (et ades sera l' alba)..."
3187,I.,"Bel Companho, since I left you I have not slept nor raised myself from"
3188,I.,"my knees; for I have prayed to God the Son of Saint Mary, that he should"
3189,I.,"send me: back my faithful comrade, and in a moment it will be dawn In"
3190,I.,"this _alba_ of Guiraut de Borneulh, the lover comes at last to the"
3191,I.,"window, and cries to his watching comrade that he is too happy to care"
3192,I.,either for the dawn or for the jealous one. The German _Wachtlieder_ are
3193,I.,"even more explicit. ""He must away at once and without delay,"" sings the"
3194,I.,"watchman in a poem of Wolfram, the austere singer of Parzifal and the"
3195,I.,"Grail Quest; ""let him go, sweet lady; let him away from thy love so that"
3196,I.,he keep his honour and life. He trusted himself to me that I should
3197,I.,"bring him safely hence; it is day ..."" ""Sing what thou wilt, watchman,"""
3198,I.,"answers the lady, ""but leave him here."" In a far superior, but also far"
3199,I.,"less chaste poem of Heinrich von Morungen, the lady, alone and"
3200,I.,"melancholy, wakes up remembering the sad white light of morning, the sad"
3201,I.,"cry of the watchman, which separated her from her knight. Still more"
3202,I.,"frankly, and in a poem which is one of the few real masterpieces of"
3203,I.,"Minnesang, the lady in Walther von der Vogelweide's ""Under der linden an"
3204,I.,"der Heide"" narrates a meeting in the wood. ""What passed between us shall"
3205,I.,"never be known by any! never by any, save him and me--yes, and by the"
3206,I.,little nightingale that sang _Tandaradei_! The little bird will surely
3207,I.,"be discreet."""
3208,I.,
3209,I.,"The songs of light love for another's wife of troubadour, trouvère, and"
3210,I.,"minnesinger, seem to have been squeezed together, so that all their"
3211,I.,"sweet and acrid perfume is, so to speak, sublimated, in the recently"
3212,I.,"discovered early Provençal narrative poem called ""Flamenca."" Like the"
3213,I.,"""Tristram"" of Gottfried von Strassburg, like all these light mediæval"
3214,I.,"love _lyrics,_ of which I have been speaking, the rhymed story of"
3215,I.,"""Flamenca,"" a pale and simple, but perfect petalled daisy, has come up"
3216,I.,in a sort of moral and intellectual dell in the winter of the Middle
3217,I.,Ages--a dell such as you meet in hollows of even the most wind-swept
3218,I.,"southern hills, where, while all round the earth is frozen and the short"
3219,I.,"grass nibbled away by the frost, may be found even at Christmas a bright"
3220,I.,"sheen of budding wheat beneath the olives on the slope, a yellow haze of"
3221,I.,sun upon the grass in which the little aromatic shoots of fennel and
3222,I.,"mint and marigold pattern with greenness the sere brown, the"
3223,I.,frost-burnt; where the very leafless fruit trees have a spring-like rosy
3224,I.,"tinge against the blue sky, and the tufted little osiers flame a joyous"
3225,I.,orange against the greenness of the hill.
3226,I.,
3227,I.,Such spots there are--and many--in the winter of the Middle Ages; though
3228,I.,"it is not in them, but where the rain beats, and the snow and the wind"
3229,I.,"tugs, that grow, struggling with bitterness, the great things of the"
3230,I.,"day: the philosophy of Abélard, the love of man of St. Francis, the"
3231,I.,"patriotism of the Lombard communes; nor that lie dormant, fertilized in"
3232,I.,"the cold earth, the great things of art and thought, the great things to"
3233,I.,come. But in them arise the delicate winter flowers which we prize:
3234,I.,"tender, pale things, without much life, things either come too soon or"
3235,I.,"stayed too late, among which is ""Flamenca;"" one of those roses, nipped"
3236,I.,"and wrinkled, but stained a brighter red by the frost, which we pluck in"
3237,I.,"December or in March; beautiful, bright, scentless roses, which, scarce"
3238,I.,"in bud, already fall to pieces in our hand. ""Flamenca"" is simply the"
3239,I.,narrative of the loves of the beautiful wife of the bearish and jealous
3240,I.,"Count Archambautz, and of Guillems de Nevers, a brilliant young knight"
3241,I.,"who hears of the lady's sore captivity, is enamoured before he sees her,"
3242,I.,"dresses up as the priest's clerk, and speaks one word with her while"
3243,I.,"presenting the mass book to be kissed, every holiday; and finally"
3244,I.,deceives the vigilance of the husband by means of a subterranean
3245,I.,"corridor, which he gets built between his inn and the bath-room of the"
3246,I.,lady at the famous waters of Bourbon-les-Bains. In this world of
3247,I.,"""Flamenca,"" which is in truth the same world as that of the ""Romaunt of"
3248,I.,"the Rose,"" the ""Morte d'Arthur,"" and of the love poets of early France"
3249,I.,"and Germany, conjugal morality and responsibility simply do not exist."
3250,I.,"It seems an unreal pleasure-garden, with a shadowy guardian--impalpable"
3251,I.,"to us gross moderns--called Honour, but where, as it seems, Love only"
3252,I.,"reigns. Love, not the mystic and melancholy god of the ""Vita Nuova,"" but"
3253,I.,"a foppish young deity, sentimental at once and sensual, of fashionable"
3254,I.,"feudal life: the god of people with no apparent duties towards others,"
3255,I.,unconscious of any restraints save those of this vague thing called
3256,I.,"honour; whose highest mission for the knight, as put in our English"
3257,I.,"""Romaunt of the Rose"" is to--"
3258,I.,
3259,I.,Set thy might and alle thy witte
3260,I.,"Wymmen and ladies for to plese,"
3261,I.,And to do thyng that may hem ese;
3262,I.,
3263,I.,"while, for the lady, it is expressed with perfect simplicity of"
3264,I.,"shamelessness by Flamenca herself to her damsels, teaching them that the"
3265,I.,"woman must yield to the pleasure of her lover. Now love, when young,"
3266,I.,"when, so to speak, but just born and able to feed (as a newborn child on"
3267,I.,"milk, without hungering for more solid food) on looks and words and"
3268,I.,"sighs; love thus young, is a fair-seeming godhead, and the devotion to"
3269,I.,him a pretty and delicate piece of æstheticism. And such it is here in
3270,I.,"""Flamenca,"" where there certainly exists neither God nor Christ, both"
3271,I.,"complete absentees, whose priest becomes a courteous lover's valet,"
3272,I.,"whose church the place for amorous rendezvous, whose sacrifice of mass"
3273,I.,"and prayer becomes a means of amorous correspondence: Cupid, in the"
3274,I.,shape of his slave Guillems de Nevers--become _patarin_(zealot) for
3275,I.,"love--peeping with shaven golden head from behind the missal, touching"
3276,I.,the lady's hand and whispering with the words of spiritual peace the
3277,I.,"declaration of love, the appointment for meeting. God and Christ, I"
3278,I.,"repeat, are absentees. Where they are I know not; perhaps over the Rhine"
3279,I.,"with the Lollards in their weavers' dens, or over the Alps in the cell"
3280,I.,"of St. Francis; not here, certainly, or if here, themselves become the"
3281,I.,"mere slaves of love. But this King Love, as long as a mere infant, is a"
3282,I.,"sweet and gracious divinity, surrounded by somewhat of the freshness and"
3283,I.,hawthorn sweetness of spring which seem to accompany his favourite
3284,I.,"Guillems. Guillems de Nevers, ""who could still grow,"" this brilliant"
3285,I.,"knight and troubadour, in his white silken and crimson and purple"
3286,I.,"garments and soundless shoes embroidered with flowers, this prince of"
3287,I.,"tournaments and _tensos_, who hearing the sorrows of the beautiful"
3288,I.,"Flamenca, loves her unseen, sits sighing in sight of her prison bower,"
3289,I.,"and faints like a hero of the Arabian Nights at her name, and has"
3290,I.,visions of her as St. Francis has of Christ; this younger and brighter
3291,I.,"Sir Launcelot, is an ideal little figure, whom you might mistake for"
3292,I.,"Love himself as described in the ""Romaunt of the Rose;"" Love's avatar or"
3293,I.,"incarnation, on whose appearance the year blooms into spring, the fruit"
3294,I.,"trees blossom, the birds sing, the girls dance at eve round the"
3295,I.,"maypoles; behind whom, while reading this poem, we seem to see the corn"
3296,I.,"shine green beneath the olives, the white-blossomed branches slant"
3297,I.,"across the blue sky. For is he not the very incarnation of chivalry, of"
3298,I.,"beauty, and of love? So much for this King Love while but quite young."
3299,I.,Unfortunately he is speedily weaned of his baby food of mere blushing
3300,I.,"glances and sighed-out names; and then his aspect, his kingdom's aspect,"
3301,I.,"the aspect of his votaries, undergoes a change. The profane but charming"
3302,I.,game of the loving clerk and the missal is exchanged for the more
3303,I.,"coarse hide-and-seek of hidden causeways and tightened bolts, with"
3304,I.,jealous husbands guarding the useless door; Guillems becomes but an
3305,I.,"ordinary Don Juan or Lovelace, Flamenca but a sorry, sneaking"
3306,I.,"adulteress, and the gracious damsels mere common sluts, curtseying at"
3307,I.,the loan (during the interview of nobler folk) of the gallant's squires.
3308,I.,"For the scent of May, of fresh leaves and fallen blossoms, we get the"
3309,I.,"nauseous vapours of the bath-room; and, alas, King Love has lost his"
3310,I.,"aureole and his wings and turned keeper of the hot springs, sought out"
3311,I.,"by the gouty and lepers, of Bourbon-les-Bains; and in closing this book,"
3312,I.,"so delightfully begun, we sicken at the whiff of hot and fetid moral air"
3313,I.,as we should sicken in passing over the outlet of the polluted hot
3314,I.,water.
3315,I.,

3317,I.,"""every one knows that illicit passion existed and exists, and has its"
3318,I.,"chroniclers, its singers in prose and in verse. But what has all this"
3319,I.,"poetry of common adultery to do with a book like the 'Vita Nuova,' with"
3320,I.,"that strange new thing, that lifelong worship of a woman, which you call"
3321,I.,"mediæval love?"" This much: that out of this illicit love, and out of it,"
3322,I.,"gross as it looks, alone arises the possibility of the ""Vita Nuova;"""
3323,I.,arises the possibility of the romantic and semi-religious love of the
3324,I.,"Middle Ages. Or, rather, let us say that this mere loose love of the"
3325,I.,"_albas_ and _Wachtlieder_ and ""Flamenca,"" is the substratum, nay, is the"
3326,I.,"very flesh and blood, of the spiritual passion to which, in later days,"
3327,I.,we owe the book of Beatrice.

3329,I.,"It is a harsh thing to say, but one which all sociology teaches us, that"
3330,I.,as there exists no sensual relation which cannot produce for its
3331,I.,"ennoblement a certain amount of passion, so also does there exist no"
3332,I.,passion (and Phædrus is there to prove it) so vile and loathsome as to
3333,I.,be unable to weave about itself a glamour of ideal sentiment. The poets
3334,I.,of the Middle Ages strove after the criminal possession of another man's
3335,I.,"wife. This, however veiled with fine and delicate poetic expressions, is"
3336,I.,"the thing for which they wait and sigh and implore; this is the reward,"
3337,I.,the supremely honouring and almost sanctifying reward which the lady
3338,I.,cannot refuse to the knight who has faithfully and humbly served her.
3339,I.,The whole bulk of the love lyrics of the early Middle Ages are there to
3340,I.,"prove it; and if the allusions in them are not sufficiently clear, those"
3341,I.,who would be enlightened may study the discussions of the allegorical
3342,I.,persons even in the English (and later) version of Guillaume de Lorris'
3343,I.,"""Roman de la Rose;"" and turn to what, were it in _langue d'oc_, we"
3344,I.,should call a _tenso_ of Guillaume li Viniers among Mätzner's
3345,I.,"""Altfranzösische Lieder-dichter."" The catastrophe of Ulrich von"
3346,I.,"Liechtenstein's ""Frowendienst,"" where the lady, the ""virtuous,"" the"
3347,I.,"""pure,"" as he is pleased to call her, after making him cut off his"
3348,I.,"finger, dress in leper's clothes, chop off part of his upper lip, and go"
3349,I.,through the most marvellous Quixotic antics dressed in satin and pearls
3350,I.,"and false hair as Queen Venus, and jousting in this costume with every"
3351,I.,"knight between Venice and Styria, all for her honour and glory; pulls"
3352,I.,"the gallant in a basket up to her window, and then lets him drop down"
3353,I.,into the moat which is no better than a sewer; this grotesque and
3354,I.,tragically resented end of Ulrich's first _love service_ speaks volumes
3355,I.,"on the point. The stones in Nostradamus' ""Lives of the Troubadours,"" the"
3356,I.,"incidents in Gottfried's ""Tristan und Isolde,"" nay, the adventures even"
3357,I.,"in our expunged English ""Morte d'Arthur,"" relating to the birth of Sir"
3358,I.,"Galahad, are as explicit as anything in Brantôme or the Queen of"
3359,I.,Navarre; the most delicate love songs of Provence and Germany are
3360,I.,"cobwebs spun round Decameronian situations. And all this is permitted,"
3361,I.,"admitted, sanctioned by feudal society even as the _cecisbeos_ of the"
3362,I.,noble Italian ladies were sanctioned by the society of the seventeenth
3363,I.,"and eighteenth centuries. In the mediæval castle, where, as we have"
3364,I.,"seen, the lady, separated from her own sex, is surrounded by a swarm of"
3365,I.,"young men without a chance of marriage, and bound to make themselves"
3366,I.,agreeable to the wife of a military superior; the woman soon ceases to
3367,I.,"be the exclusive property of her husband, and the husband speedily"
3368,I.,"discovers that the majority, hence public ridicule, are against any"
3369,I.,"attempt at monopolizing her. Thus adultery becomes, as we have seen,"
3370,I.,"accepted as an institution under the name of _service_; and, like all"
3371,I.,"other social institutions, developes a morality of its own--a morality"
3372,I.,"within immorality, of faithfulness within infidelity. The lady must be"
3373,I.,"true to her knight, and the knight must be true to his lady: the Courts"
3374,I.,of Love solemnly banish from society any woman who is known to have more
3375,I.,than one lover. Faithfulness is the first and most essential virtue of
3376,I.,"mediæval love; a virtue unknown to the erotic poets of Antiquity, and"
3377,I.,"which modern times have inherited from the Middle Ages as a requisite,"
3378,I.,even (as the reproaches of poets of the Alfred de Musset school teach
3379,I.,"us) in the most completely illicit love. Tristram and Launcelot, the two"
3380,I.,"paragons of knighthood, are inviolably constant to their mistress: the"
3381,I.,"husband may and must be deceived, but not the wife who helps to deceive"
3382,I.,"him. Yseult of Brittany and Elaine, the mother of Galahad, do not"
3383,I.,succeed in breaking the vows made to Yseult the Fair and to Queen
3384,I.,"Guenevere. The beautiful lady in the hawthorn _alba_ ""a son cor en amar"
3385,I.,"lejalmens."" But this loyal loving is for the knight who is warned to"
3386,I.,"depart, certainly not for the husband, the _gilos_, in whose despite"
3387,I.,"(""Bels dous amios, baizem nos eu e vos--Aval els pratzon chantols"
3388,I.,"auzellos--_Tot O fassam en despeit del gilos_"") they are meeting. The"
3389,I.,"ladies of the minnesingers are ""pure,"" ""good,"" ""faithful"" (and each and"
3390,I.,"all are pure, good, and faithful, as long as they do not resist) from"
3391,I.,"the point of view of the lover, not of the husband, if indeed a husband"
3392,I.,be permitted to have any point of view at all. And as fidelity is the
3393,I.,"essential virtue in these adulterous connections, so infidelity is the"
3394,I.,"greatest crime that a woman (and even a man) can commit, the greatest"
3395,I.,misfortune which fate can send to an unhappy knight. That he leaves a
3396,I.,"faithful mistress behind him is the one hope of the knight who, taking"
3397,I.,"the cross, departs to meet the scimitars of Saladin's followers, the"
3398,I.,"fevers, the plagues, the many miserable deaths of the unknown East. ""If"
3399,I.,"any lady be unfaithful,"" says Quienes de Béthune, ""she will have to be"
3400,I.,"unfaithful with some base wretch."""

3430,I.,"thus one of the interlocutors in a French _jeu-parti_, published by"

3432,I.,"and Launcelot, and from the last remnants of mediæval love lore in"
3433,I.,"modern French novels, means simply that the more completely a man has"
3434,I.,"induced a woman to deceive her husband, the more stoutly is he bound to"
3435,I.,"deny, with lies, rows, and blows, that she has ever done anything of the"
3436,I.,"sort. Here, then, we find established, as a very fundamental necessity"
3437,I.,"of this socially recognized adultery, a reciprocity of fidelity between"
3438,I.,lover and mistress which Antiquity never dreamed of even between husband
3439,I.,"and wife (Agamemnon has a perfect right to Briseis or Chryseis, but"
3440,I.,Clytæmnestra has no right to Aegisthus); and which indeed could scarcely
3441,I.,arise as a moral obligation except where the woman was not bound to love
3442,I.,the man (which the wife is) and where her behaviour towards him depended
3443,I.,"wholly upon her pleasure, that is to say, upon her satisfaction with his"
3444,I.,"behaviour towards her. This, which seems to us so obvious, and of which"
3445,I.,every day furnishes us an example in the relations of the modern suitor
3446,I.,"and his hoped-for wife, could not, at a time when women were married by"
3447,I.,"family arrangement, arise except as a result of illegitimate love."
3448,I.,"Horrible as it seems, the more we examine into this subject of mediæval"
3449,I.,"love, the more shall we see that our whole code of Grandisonian chivalry"
3450,I.,between lovers who intend marriage is derived from the practice of the
3451,I.,"Launcelots and Gueneveres, not from that of the married people (we may"
3452,I.,remember the manner in which Gunther woos his wife Brunhilt in the
3453,I.,"Nibelungenlied) of former ages; nay, the more we shall have to recognize"
3454,I.,that the very feeling which constitutes the virtuous love of modern
3455,I.,poets is derived from the illegitimate loves of the Middle Ages.
3456,I.,
3457,I.,Let us examine what are the habits of feeling and thinking which grow
3458,I.,out of this reciprocal fidelity due to the absence of all one-sided
3459,I.,"legal pressure in this illegitimate, but socially legitimated, love of"
3460,I.,the early Middle Ages; which are added on to it by the very necessities
3461,I.,"of illicit connection. The lover, having no right to the favours of his"
3462,I.,"mistress, is obliged, in order to win and to keep them, to please her by"
3463,I.,"humility, fidelity, and such knightly qualities as are the ideal plumage"
3464,I.,"of a man: he must bring home to her, by showing the world her colours"
3465,I.,"victorious in serious warfare, in the scarcely less dangerous play of"
3466,I.,"tournaments, and by making her beauty and virtues more illustrious in"
3467,I.,his song than are those of other women in the songs of their lovers--he
3468,I.,must bring home to her that she has a more worthy servant than her
3469,I.,rivals; he must determine her to select him and to adhere to her
3470,I.,"selection. Now mediæval husbands select their wives, instead of being"
3471,I.,"selected; and once the woman and the dowry are in their hands, trouble"
3472,I.,themselves but little whether they are approved of or not. On the other
3473,I.,"hand, the mistress appears to her lover invested with imaginative, ideal"
3474,I.,advantages such as cannot surround her in the eyes of her husband: she
3475,I.,"is, in nearly every case, his superior in station and the desired of"
3476,I.,many beholders; she is bound to him by no tie which may grow prosaic and
3477,I.,"wearisome; she appears to him in no domestic capacity, can never descend"
3478,I.,"to be the female drudge; her possession is prevented from growing stale,"
3479,I.,"her personality from becoming commonplace, by the difficulty, rareness,"
3480,I.,"mystery, adventure, danger, which even in the days of Courts of Love"
3481,I.,"attach to illicit amours; above all, being for this man neither the"
3482,I.,"housewife nor the mother, she remains essentially and continually the"
3483,I.,"mistress, the beloved. Similarly the relations between the knight and"
3484,I.,"the lady, untroubled by domestic worries, pecuniary difficulties, and"
3485,I.,"squabbles about children, remain, exist merely as love relations,"
3486,I.,relations of people whose highest and sole desire is to please one
3487,I.,"another. Moreover, and this is an important consideration, the lady, who"
3488,I.,"is a mere inexperienced, immature girl when she first meets her husband,"
3489,I.,"is a mature woman, with character and passions developed by the"
3490,I.,"independence of conjugal and social life. When she meets her lover,"
3491,I.,whatever power or dignity of character she may possess is ripe; whatever
3492,I.,intensity of aspiration and passion may be latent is ready to come
3493,I.,"forth; for the first time there is equality in love. Equality? Ah, no."
3494,I.,"This woman who is the wife of his feudal superior, this woman surrounded"
3495,I.,"by all the state of feudal sovereignty, this woman who, however young,"
3496,I.,"has already known so much of life, this woman whose love is a free, gift"
3497,I.,"of grace to the obscure, trembling vassal who has a right not even to be"
3498,I.,noticed; this lady of mediæval love must always remain immeasurably
3499,I.,"above her lover. And, in the long day-dreams while watching her, as he"
3500,I.,"thinks unseen, while singing of her, as he thinks unheard, there cluster"
3501,I.,"round her figure, mistily seen in his fancy, those vague and-mystic"
3502,I.,"splendours which surround the new sovereign of the Middle Ages, the"
3503,I.,Queen of Heaven; there mingles in the half-terrified raptures of the
3504,I.,"first kind glance, the first encouraging word, the ineffable passion"
3505,I.,"stored up in the Christian's heart for the immortal beings who, in the"
3506,I.,"days of Bernard and Francis, descend cloud-like on earth and fill the"
3507,I.,cells of the saints with unendurable glory.
3508,I.,
3509,I.,"And thus, out of the baseness of habitual adultery, arises incense-like,"
3510,I.,"in the early mediæval poetry, a new kind of love--subtler, more"
3511,I.,"imaginative, more passionate, a love of the fancy and the heart, a love"
3512,I.,stimulating to the perfection of the individual as is any religion;
3513,I.,"nay, a religion, and one appealing more completely to the complete man,"
3514,I.,"flesh and soul, than even the mystical beliefs of the Middle Ages. And"
3515,I.,"as, in the fantastic song of Ritter Tannhäuser, whose liege lady, so"
3516,I.,"legend tells, was Dame Venus herself, the lady bids the knight go forth"
3517,I.,"and fetch her green water which has washed the setting sun, salamanders"
3518,I.,"snatched from the flame, the stars out of heaven; so would it seem as if"
3519,I.,"this new power in the world, this poetically worshipped woman, had sent"
3520,I.,"forth mankind to seek wonderful new virtues, never before seen on earth."
3521,I.,"Nay, rather, as the snowflakes became green leaves, the frost blossoms"
3522,I.,"red and blue flowers, the winter wind a spring-scented breeze, when"
3523,I.,Bernard de Ventadorn was greeted by his mistress; so also does it seem
3524,I.,"as if, at the first greeting of the world by this new love, the mediæval"
3525,I.,"winter had turned to summer, and there had budded forth and flowered a"
3526,I.,"new ideal of manly virtue, a new ideal of womanly grace."
3527,I.,
3528,I.,"But evil is evil, and evil is its fruit. Out of circumstances hitherto"
3529,I.,"unknown, circumstances come about for the first time owing to the"
3530,I.,"necessities of illegitimate passion, have arisen certain new and nobler"
3531,I.,"characters of sexual love, certain new and beautiful conceptions of"
3532,I.,manly and womanly nature. The circumstances to which these are owed are
3533,I.,"pure in themselves, they are circumstances which in more modern times"
3534,I.,have characterized the perfectly legitimate passion of lovers held
3535,I.,"asunder by no social law, but by mere accidental barriers--from Romeo"
3536,I.,and Juliet to the Master of Ravenswood and Lucy Ashton; and pure so far
3537,I.,"have been the spiritual results. But these circumstances were due, in"
3538,I.,"the early Middle Ages, to the fact of adultery; and to the new ideal of"
3539,I.,"love has clung, even in its purity, in its superior nobility, an element"
3540,I.,of corruption as unknown to gross and corrupt Antiquity as was the
3541,I.,delicacy and nobility of mediæval love. The most poetical and pathetic
3542,I.,"of all mediæval love stories, the very incarnation of all that is most"
3543,I.,"lyric at once and most tragic in the new kind of passion, is the story,"
3544,I.,"told and retold by a score of poets and prose writers, of the loves of"
3545,I.,"Yseult of Ireland and of Sir Tristram who, as the knight was bringing"
3546,I.,"the princess to his uncle and her affianced, King Mark of Cornwall drank"
3547,I.,together by a fatal mistake a philter which made all such as partook of
3548,I.,it in common inseparable lovers even unto death. Every one knows the
3549,I.,result r: how Yseult came to her husband already the paramour of
3550,I.,"Tristram; how Brangwaine, her damsel, feeling that this unhallowed"
3551,I.,passion was due to her having left-within reach the potion intended for
3552,I.,"the King and Queen of Cornwall, devoted herself, at the price of her"
3553,I.,"maidenhood, to connive in the amours of the lovers whom she had made;"
3554,I.,"how King Mark was deceived, and doubted, and was deceived again; how"
3555,I.,"Tristram fled to Brittany, but how, despite his seeming marriage with"
3556,I.,"another and equally lovely Yseult, he remained faithful to the Queen of"
3557,I.,Cornwall. One version tells that Mark slew his nephew while he sat
3558,I.,harping to Queen Yseult; another that Tristram died of grief because his
3559,I.,"scorned though wedded wife told him that the white-sailed ship, bearing"
3560,I.,"his mistress to meet him, bore the black sail which meant that she was"
3561,I.,"not on board; but all versions, I think, agree in ending with the fact,"
3562,I.,"that the briar-rose growing on the tomb of the one, slowly trailed its"
3563,I.,flowers and thorns along till it had reached also the grave of the
3564,I.,"other, and knit together, as love had knit together with its sweet"
3565,I.,"blossoms and sharp spines, the two fated lovers. The Middle Ages were"
3566,I.,"enthralled by this tale; but they were also, occasionally, a little"
3567,I.,shocked by it. Poets and prose writers tampered every now and then with
3568,I.,"incidents and characters, seeking to make it appear that, owing to the"
3569,I.,"substitution of the waiting-maid, and the neglect of the wedded princess"
3570,I.,"of Brittany, Yseult had never belonged to any man save Tristram, nor"
3571,I.,Tristram to any woman save Yseult; or that King Mark had sent his nephew
3572,I.,to woo the Irish queen's daughter merely in hopes of his perishing in
3573,I.,"the attempt, and that his whole subsequent conduct was due to a mere"
3574,I.,unnatural hatred of a better knight than himself; touching up here and
3575,I.,there with a view to justifying and excusing to some degree the long
3576,I.,series of deceits which constituted the whole story. Thus the more timid
3577,I.,"and less gifted. But when, in the very first years (1210) of the"
3578,I.,"thirteenth century, the greatest mediæval poet that preceded Dante, the"
3579,I.,"greatest German poet that preceded Goethe, Meister Gottfried von"
3580,I.,"Strassburg, took in hand the old threadbare story of ""Tristan und"
3581,I.,"Isolde,"" he despised all alterations of this sort, and accepted the"
3582,I.,original tale in its complete crudeness.
3583,I.,
3584,I.,"For, consciously or unconsciously, Gottfried had conceived this story as"
3585,I.,"a thing wholly unknown in his time, and no longer subject to any of"
3586,I.,those necessities of constant rearrangement which tormented mediæval
3587,I.,"poets: he had conceived it not as a tale, but as a novel. Gottfried"
3588,I.,himself was probably but little aware of what he was doing; the poem
3589,I.,that he was writing probably fell for him into the very same category as
3590,I.,"the poems of other men; but to us, with our experience of so many"
3591,I.,"different forms of narrative, it must be evident that ""Tristan und"
3592,I.,"Isolde"" is a new departure, inasmuch as it is not the story of deeds and"
3593,I.,"the people who did them, like the true epic from Homer to the"
3594,I.,Nibelungen; nor the story of people and the adventures which happened to
3595,I.,"them, like all romance poetry from ""Palemon and Arcite,"" to the ""Orlando"
3596,I.,"Furioso;"" but, on the contrary, the story of the psychological"
3597,I.,"relations, the gradual metamorphosis of soul by soul, between two"
3598,I.,persons. The long introductory story of Tristram's youth must not
3599,I.,"mislead us, nor all the minute narrations of the killing of dragons and"
3600,I.,"the drinking of love philters: Gottfried, we must remember, was"
3601,I.,"certainly no deliberate innovator, and these thing's are the mere"
3602,I.,"inevitable externalities of mediæval poetry, preserved with dull slavish"
3603,I.,"care by the re-writer of a well-known tale, but enclosing in reality"
3604,I.,something essentially and startlingly modern: the history of a passion
3605,I.,and of the spiritual changes which it brings about in those who are its
3606,I.,victims.
3607,I.,
3608,I.,To meet again this purely psychological interest we must skip the whole
3609,I.,"rest of the Middle Ages, nay, skip even the great period of dramatic"
3610,I.,"literature, not stopping till we come to the end of the seventeenth and"
3611,I.,"beginning of the eighteenth century, to the ""Princesse de Clèves,"" to"
3612,I.,"""Clarissa Harlowe,"" nay, really, to ""The Nouvelle Heloise."" For even in"
3613,I.,Shakespeare there is always interest and importance in the action and
3614,I.,"reaction of subsidiary characters, in the event, in the accidental;"
3615,I.,"there is intrigue, chance, misunderstanding, fate--active agencies of"
3616,I.,"which Othello and Hamlet, King Lear and Romeo, are helpless victims;"
3617,I.,"there is, even in this psychological English drama of the Elizabethans,"
3618,I.,"fate in the shape of Iago, in the shape of the Ghost, in the shape of"
3619,I.,"the brothers of Webster's duchess; fate in the shape of a ring, a"
3620,I.,"letter, a drug, but fate always. And in this ""Tristan und Isolde"" of"
3621,I.,Gottfried von Strassburg is there not fate also in the love potion
3622,I.,"intended for King Mark, and given by the mistake of Brangwaine to Mark's"
3623,I.,"bride and his nephew? To this objection, which will naturally occur to"
3624,I.,"any reader who is not acquainted with the poem of Gottfried, I simply"
3625,I.,"answer, there is not. The love potion there is, but it does not play the"
3626,I.,"same part as do, for instance, the drugs of Friar Laurence and his"
3627,I.,intercepted letter. Suppose the friar's narcotic to have been less
3628,I.,"enduring in its action, or his message to have reached in safety, why"
3629,I.,"then Juliet would have been awake instead of asleep, or Romeo would not"
3630,I.,"have supposed her to be dead, and instead of the suicide of the two"
3631,I.,"lovers, we should have had the successful carying off of Juliet by"
3632,I.,"Romeo. Not so with Gottfried. The philter is there, and a great deal is"
3633,I.,"talked about it; but it is merely one of the old, threadbare trappings"
3634,I.,"of the original story, which he has been too lazy to suppress; it is"
3635,I.,"merely, for the reader, the allegorical signal for an outburst of"
3636,I.,passion which all our subsequent knowledge of Tristram and Yseult shows
3637,I.,"us to be absolutely inevitable. In Gottfried's poem, the drinking of the"
3638,I.,"potion signifies merely that all the rambling, mediæval prelude, not to"
3639,I.,"be distinguished from the stories of ""Morte d'Arthur,"" and of half the"
3640,I.,"romances of the Middle Ages, has come to a close and may be forgotten;"
3641,I.,"and that the real work of the great poet, the real, matchless tragedy of"
3642,I.,"the four actors--Tristram, Yseult, Mark, and Brangwaine--has begun."
3643,I.,
3644,I.,Yet if we seek again to account to ourselves for this astonishing
3645,I.,"impression of modernness which we receive from Gottfried's poem, we"
3646,I.,recognize that it is due to something far more important than the mere
3647,I.,"precocious psychological interest; nay, rather, that this psychological"
3648,I.,"interest is itself dependent upon the fact which makes ""Tristan und"
3649,I.,"Isolde,"" so modern to our feelings. This fact is simply that the poem of"
3650,I.,"Gottfried is the earliest, and yet perhaps almost the completest,"
3651,I.,"example of a literary anomaly which Antiquity, for all its abominations,"
3652,I.,"did not know: the glorification of fidelity in adultery, the"
3653,I.,glorification of excellence within the compass of guilt. Older times
3654,I.,"--more distant from our own in spirit, though not necessarily in"
3655,I.,years--have presented us with many themes of guilt: the guilt which
3656,I.,"exists according to our own moral standard, but not according to that of"
3657,I.,"the narrator, as the magnificently tragic Icelandic incest story of"
3658,I.,"Sigmund and Signy; the guilt which has come about no one well knows how,"
3659,I.,"an unfortunate circumstance leaving the sinner virtually stainless, in"
3660,I.,"his or her own eyes and the eyes of others, like the Homeric Helen; the"
3661,I.,"heroic guilt, where the very heroism seems due to the self-sacrifice of"
3662,I.,"the sinner's innocence, of Judith; the struggling, remorseful guilt,"
3663,I.,"hopelessly overcome by fate and nature, of Phædra; the dull and dogged"
3664,I.,"guilt, making the sinner scarce more than a mere physical"
3665,I.,"stumbling-block for others, of the murderer Hagen in the Nibelungenlied;"
3666,I.,"and, finally, the perverse guilt, delighting in the consciousness of"
3667,I.,"itself, of demons like Richard and Iago, of libidinous furies like the"
3668,I.,"heroines of Tourneur and Marston. The guilt theme of ""Tristan und"
3669,I.,"Isolde"" falls into none of these special categories. This theme,"
3670,I.,"unguessed even by Shakespeare, is that of the virtuous behaviour towards"
3671,I.,one another of two individuals united in sinning against every one else.
3672,I.,Gottfried von Strassburg narrates with the greatest detail how Tristram
3673,I.,"leads to the unsuspecting king the unblushing, unremorseful woman"
3674,I.,polluted by his own embraces; how Yseult substitutes on the wedding
3675,I.,"night her spotless damsel Brangwaine for her own sullied self; then,"
3676,I.,"terrified lest the poor victim of her dishonour should ever reveal it,"
3677,I.,"attempts to have her barbarously murdered, and, finally, seeing that"
3678,I.,"nothing can shake the heroic creature's faith, admits her once more to"
3679,I.,be the remorseful go-between in her amours. He narrates how Tristram
3680,I.,"dresses as a pilgrim and carries the queen from a ship to the shore, in"
3681,I.,order that Yseult may call on Christ to bear witness by a miracle that
3682,I.,"she is innocent of adultery, never having been touched save by that"
3683,I.,"pilgrim and her own husband; and how, when the followers of King Mark"
3684,I.,"have surrounded the grotto in the wood, Tristram places the drawn sword"
3685,I.,"between himself and the sleeping queen, as a symbol of their chastity"
3686,I.,"which the king is too honest to suspect. He draws, with a psychological"
3687,I.,"power truly extraordinary in the beginning of the thirteenth century,"
3688,I.,"the two other figures in this love drama: King Mark, cheated,"
3689,I.,"dishonoured, oscillating between horrible doubt, ignominious suspicion"
3690,I.,"and more ignominious credulity, his love for his wife, his trust in his"
3691,I.,"nephew, his incapacity for conceiving ill-faith and fraud, the very"
3692,I.,"gentleness and generosity of his nature, made the pander of guilt in"
3693,I.,"which he cannot believe; and, on the other side, Brangwaine, the"
3694,I.,"melancholy, mute victim of her fidelity to Yseult, the weak, heroic"
3695,I.,"soul, rewarded only with cruel ingratitude, and condemned to screen and"
3696,I.,help the sin which she loathes and for which she assumes the awful
3697,I.,"responsibility. All this does Gottfried do, yet without ever seeming to"
3698,I.,"perceive the baseness and wickedness of this tissue of lies,"
3699,I.,"equivocations, and perjuries in which his lovers hide their passion;"
3700,I.,without ever seeming to guess at the pathos and nobility of the man and
3701,I.,the woman who are the mere trumpery obstacles or trumpery aids to their
3702,I.,amours. He heaps upon Tristram and Yseult the most extravagant praises:
3703,I.,"he is the flower of all knighthood, and she, the kindest, gentlest,"
3704,I.,"purest, and noblest of women; he insists upon the wickedness of the"
3705,I.,"world which is for ever waging war upon their passion, and holds up to"
3706,I.,execration all those who seek to spy out their secret. Gottfried is most
3707,I.,genuinely overcome by the ideal beauty of this inextinguishable
3708,I.,"devotion, by the sublimity of this love which holds the whole world as"
3709,I.,dross; the crimes of the lovers are for him the mere culminating point
3710,I.,"of their moral grandeur, which has ceased to know any guilt save"
3711,I.,"absence of love, any virtue save loving. And so serene is the old"
3712,I.,"minnesinger's persuasion, that it obscures the judgment and troubles the"
3713,I.,"heart even of his reader; and we are tempted to ask ourselves, on laying"
3714,I.,"down the book, whether indeed this could have been sinful, this love of"
3715,I.,"Tristram and Yseult which triumphed over everything in the world, and"
3716,I.,could be quenched only by death. That circle of hell where all those who
3717,I.,"had sinfully loved were whirled incessantly in the perse, dark, stormy"
3718,I.,"air, appeared in the eyes even of Dante as a place less of punishment"
3719,I.,"than of glory; and, especially since the Middle Ages, all mankind looks"
3720,I.,upon that particular hell-pit with admiration rather than with loathing.
3721,I.,"And herein consists, more even than in any deceptions practised upon"
3722,I.,"King Mark or any ingratitude manifested towards Brangwaine, the"
3723,I.,sinfulness of Tristram and Yseult: sinfulness which is not finite like
3724,I.,"the individual lives which it offends, but infinite and immortal as the"
3725,I.,"heart and the judgment which it perverts. For such a tale, and so told,"
3726,I.,"as the tale of Gottfried von Strassburg, makes us sympathize with this"
3727,I.,fidelity and devotion of a man and woman who care for nothing in the
3728,I.,"world save for each other, who are dragged and glued together by the"
3729,I.,desire and habit of mutual pleasure; it makes us admire their readiness
3730,I.,"to die rather than be parted, when their whole life is concentrated in"
3731,I.,"their reciprocal sin, when their miserable natures enjoy, care for,"
3732,I.,"know, only this miserable love. It makes us wink with leniency at the"
3733,I.,"dishonour, the baseness, the cruelty, to which all this easy virtue is"
3734,I.,"due. And such sympathy, such admiration, such leniency, for howsoever"
3735,I.,"short a time they may remain in our soul, leave it, if they ever leave"
3736,I.,"it completely and utterly less strong, less clean than it was before. We"
3737,I.,have all of us a lazy tendency to approve of the virtue which costs no
3738,I.,"trouble; to contemplate in ourselves or others, with a spurious moral"
3739,I.,"satisfaction, the development of this or that virtuous quality in souls"
3740,I.,which are deteriorating in undoubted criminal self-indulgence. We have
3741,I.,"all of us, at the bottom of our hearts, a fellow feeling for all human"
3742,I.,affection; and the sinfulness of sinners like Tristram and Yseult lies
3743,I.,largely in the fact that they pervert this legitimate and holy sympathy
3744,I.,"into a dangerous leniency for any strong and consistent love, into a"
3745,I.,"morbid admiration for any irresistible mutual passion, making us forget"
3746,I.,"that love has in itself no moral value, and that while self-indulgence"
3747,I.,"may often be innocent, only self-abnegation can ever be holy."
3748,I.,
3749,I.,The great mediæval German poem of Tristram and Yseult remained for
3750,I.,"centuries a unique phenomenon; only John Ford perhaps, that grander and"
3751,I.,"darker twin spirit of Gottfried von Strassburg, reviving, even among the"
3752,I.,"morbidly psychological and crime-fascinated followers of Shakespeare,"
3753,I.,that new theme of evil--the heroism of unlawful love. But Gottfried had
3754,I.,merely manipulated with precocious analytical power a mode of feeling
3755,I.,and thinking which was universal in the feudal Middle Ages; the great
3756,I.,"epic of adultery was forgotten, but the sympathetic and admiring"
3757,I.,"interest in illegitimate passion remained; and was transmitted, wherever"
3758,I.,the Renaissance or the Reformation did not break through such
3759,I.,"transmission of mediæval habits, as an almost inborn instinct from"
3760,I.,"father to son, from mother to daughter. And we may doubt whether the"
3761,I.,important class of men and women who write and read the novels of
3762,I.,"illicit love, could ever have existed, had not the psychological artists"
3763,I.,"of modern times, from Rousseau to George Sand, and from Stendhal to"
3764,I.,"Octave Feuillet, found ready prepared for them in the countries not"
3765,I.,"re-tempered by Protestantism, an assoiation of romance, heroism, and"
3766,I.,"ideality with mere adulterous passion, which was unknown to the"
3767,I.,"corruption of Antiquity and to the lawlessness of the Dark Ages, and"
3768,I.,which remained as a fatal alloy to that legacy of mere spiritual love
3769,I.,which was left to the world by the love poets of early feudalism.
3770,I.,
3771,I.,
3772,II.,II.
3773,II.,
3774,II.,"The love of the troubadours and minnesingers, of the Arthurian tales,"
3775,II.,"which show that love in narrative form, was, as we have seen, polluted"
3776,II.,"by the selfishness, the deceitfulness, the many unclean necessities of"
3777,II.,"adulterous passion. Elevated and exquisite though it was, it could not"
3778,II.,"really purify the relations of man and woman, since it was impure. Nay,"
3779,II.,we see that through its influence the grave and simple married love of
3780,II.,"the earlier tales of chivalry, the love of Siegfried for Chriemhilt, of"
3781,II.,"Roland for his bride Belle Aude, of Renaud for his wife Clarisse, is"
3782,II.,gradually replaced in later fiction by the irregular love-makings of
3783,II.,"Huon of Bordeaux, Ogier the Dane, and Artus of Brittany; until we come"
3784,II.,"at last to the extraordinary series of the Amadis romances, where every"
3785,II.,"hero without exception is the bastard of virtuous parents, who"
3786,II.,subsequently marry and discover their foundling: a state of things
3787,II.,"which, even in the corrupt Renaissance, Boiardo and Ariosto found it"
3788,II.,"necessary to reform in their romantic poems. With idealizing refinement,"
3789,II.,"the chivalric love of the French, Provençal, and German poets brings"
3790,II.,"also a kind of demoralization which, from one point of view, makes the"
3791,II.,"spotless songs of Bernard de Ventadour and Armaud de Mareulh, of Ulrich"
3792,II.,"von Liechtenstein and Frauenlob, less pure than the licentious poems"
3793,II.,"addressed by the Greeks and Romans to women who, at least, were not the"
3794,II.,wives of other men.
3795,II.,
3796,II.,"Shall all this idealizing refinement, this almost religious fervour,"
3797,II.,this new poetic element of chivalric love remain useless; or serve only
3798,II.,to subtly pollute while pretending to purify the great singing passion?
3799,II.,Not so. But to prevent such waste of what in itself is pure and
3800,II.,"precious, is the mission of another country, of another civilization; of"
3801,II.,"a wholly different cycle of poets who, receiving the new element of"
3802,II.,mediæval love after it has passed through and been sifted by a number
3803,II.,"of hands, shall cleanse and recreate it in the fire of intellectual and"
3804,II.,"almost abstract passion, producing that wonderful essence of love which,"
3805,II.,as the juices squeezed by alchemists out of jewels purified the body
3806,II.,"from all its ills, shall purify away all the diseases of the human soul."
3807,II.,
3808,II.,While the troubadours and minnesingers had been singing at the courts of
3809,II.,"Angevine kings and Hohenstauffen emperors, of counts of Toulouse and"
3810,II.,"dukes of Austria; a new civilization, a new political and social system,"
3811,II.,had gradually been developing in the free burghs of Italy; a new life
3812,II.,entirely the reverse of the life of feudal countries. The Italian cities
3813,II.,"were communities of manufacturers and merchants, into which only"
3814,II.,"gradually, and at the sacrifice of every aristocratic privilege and"
3815,II.,"habit, a certain number of originally foreign feudatories were gradually"
3816,II.,"absorbed. Each community consisted of a number of mercantile families,"
3817,II.,"equal before the law, and illustrious or obscure according to their"
3818,II.,"talents or riches, whose members, instead of being scattered over a wide"
3819,II.,"area like the members of the feudal nobility, were most often gathered"
3820,II.,"together under one roof--sons, brothers, nephews, daughters, sisters and"
3821,II.,"daughters-in-law, forming a hierarchy attending to the business of"
3822,II.,"factory or counting-house under the orders of the father of the family,"
3823,II.,and to the economy of the house-under the superintendence of the mother;
3824,II.,"a manner of living at once business-like and patriarchal, expounded"
3825,II.,"pounded by the interlocutors in Alberti's ""Governo della Famiglia,"" and"
3826,II.,which lasted until the dissolution of the commonwealths and almost to
3827,II.,"our own times. Such habits imply a social organization, an intercourse"
3828,II.,"between men and women, and a code of domestic morality the exact"
3829,II.,"opposite to those of feudal countries. Here, in the Italian cities,"
3830,II.,"there are no young men bound to loiter, far from their homes, round the"
3831,II.,"wife of a military superior, to whom her rank and her isolation from all"
3832,II.,neighbours give idleness and solitude. The young men are all of them in
3833,II.,"business, usually with their own kinsfolk; not in their employer's"
3834,II.,"house, but in his office; they have no opportunity of seeing a woman"
3835,II.,"from dawn till sunset. The women, on their side, are mainly employed at"
3836,II.,"home: the whole domestic arrangement depends upon them, and keeps their"
3837,II.,"hands constantly full; working, and working in the company of their"
3838,II.,female relatives and friends. Men and women are free comparatively
3839,II.,"little, and then they are free all together in the same places; hence no"
3840,II.,opportunities for _tête-à-tête_. Early Italian poetry is fond of showing
3841,II.,us the young poet reading his verses or explaining his passion to those
3842,II.,"gentle, compassionate women learned in love, of whom we meet a troop,"
3843,II.,"beautiful, vague, half-arch, half-melancholy faces, consoling Dante in"
3844,II.,"the ""Vita Nuova,"" and reminding Guido Cavalcanti of his lady far off at"
3845,II.,Toulouse. But such women almost invariably form a group; they cannot be
3846,II.,approached singly. Such a state of society inevitably produces a high
3847,II.,and strict morality. In these early Italian cities a case of in'
3848,II.,fidelity is punished ruthlessly; the lover banished or killed; the wife
3849,II.,"for ever lost to the world, perhaps condemned to solitude and a"
3850,II.,"lingering death in the fever tracts, like Pia dei Tolomei. A complacent"
3851,II.,deceived husband is even more ridiculous (the deceived husband is
3852,II.,notoriously the chief laughing stock of all mediæval free towns) than is
3853,II.,a jealous husband among the authorized and recognized _cicisbeos_ of a
3854,II.,feudal court. Indeed the respect for marriage vows inevitable in this
3855,II.,"busy democratic mediæval life is so strong, that long after the"
3856,II.,"commonwealths have turned into despotisms, and every social tie has been"
3857,II.,"dissolved in the Renaissance, the wives and daughters of men stained"
3858,II.,"with every libidinous vice, nay, of the very despots themselves"
3859,II.,--Tiberiuses and Neros on a smaller scale--remain spotless in the midst
3860,II.,of evil; and authorized adultery begins in Italy only under the Spanish
3861,II.,rule in the late sixteenth century.
3862,II.,
3863,II.,"Such were the manners and morals of the Italian commonwealths when,"
3864,II.,"about the middle of the thirteenth century, the men of Tuscany, now free"
3865,II.,"and prosperous, suddenly awoke to the consciousness that they had a soul"
3866,II.,"which desired song, and a language which was spontaneously singing. It"
3867,II.,was the moment when painting was beginning to claim for the figures of
3868,II.,real men and women the walls and vaulted spaces whence had hitherto
3869,II.,"glowered, with vacant faces and huge ghostlike eyes, mosaic figures,"
3870,II.,from their shimmering golden ground; the moment when the Pisan artists
3871,II.,had sculptured solemnly draped madonnas and kings not quite unworthy of
3872,II.,"the carved sarcophagi which stood around them; the moment when, merging"
3873,II.,"together old Byzantine traditions and Northern examples, the architects"
3874,II.,"of Florence, Siena, and Orvieto conceived a style which made cathedrals"
3875,II.,"into marvellous and huge reliquaries of marble, jasper, alabaster, and"
3876,II.,"mosaics. The mediæval flowering time had come late, very late, in Italy;"
3877,II.,"but the atmosphere was only the warmer, the soil the richer, and Italy"
3878,II.,put forth a succession of exquisite and superb immortal flowers of art
3879,II.,when the artistic sap of other countries had begun to be exhausted. But
3880,II.,"the Italians, the Tuscans, audacious in the other arts, were diffident"
3881,II.,"of themselves with regard to poetry. Architecture, painting, sculpture,"
3882,II.,"had been the undisputed field for plebeian craftsmen, belonging"
3883,II.,exclusively to the free burghs and disdained by the feudal castles; but
3884,II.,"poetry was essentially the aristocratic, the feudal art, cultivated by"
3885,II.,knights and cultivated for kings and barons. It was probably an unspoken
3886,II.,sense of this fact which caused the early Tuscan poets to misgive their
3887,II.,own powers and to turn wistfully and shyly towards the poets of Provence
3888,II.,"and of Sicily. There, beyond the seas, under the last lords of Toulouse"
3889,II.,"and the brilliant mongrel Hohenstauffen princes, were courts, knights,"
3890,II.,and ladies; there was the tradition of this courtly art of poetry; and
3891,II.,"there only could the sons of Florentine or Sienese merchants,"
3892,II.,"clodhoppers in gallantry and song, hope to learn the correct style of"
3893,II.,thing. Hence the history of the Italian lyric before Dante is the
3894,II.,history of a series of transformations which connect a style of poetry
3895,II.,"absolutely feudal and feudally immoral, with the hitherto unheard-of"
3896,II.,"platonic love subtleties of the ""Vita Nuova."" And it is curious, in"
3897,II.,"looking over the collections of early Italian lyrists, to note the"
3898,II.,alteration in tone as Sicily and the feudal courts are left further and
3899,II.,"further behind. Ciullo d' Alcamo, flourishing about 1190, is the only"
3900,II.,Italian-writing poet absolutely contemporaneous with the earlier and
3901,II.,"better trouvères, troubadours, and minnesingers; and he is also the only"
3902,II.,"one who resembles them very closely. His famous _tenso_, beginning ""Rosa"
3903,II.,"fresca aulentissima"" (a tolerably faithful translation heads the"
3904,II.,"beautiful collection of the late Mr. D.G. Rossetti), is indeed more"
3905,II.,explicitly gross and immoral than the majority of Provençal and German
3906,II.,"love-songs: loose as are many of the _albas, serenas, wachtlieder_, and"
3907,II.,"even many of the less special forms of German and Provençal poetry, I am"
3908,II.,"acquainted with none of them which comes up to this singular dialogue,"
3909,II.,"in which a man, refusing to marry a woman, little by little wins her"
3910,II.,over to his wishes and makes her brazenly invite him to her dishonour.
3911,II.,"Between Ciullo d' Alcamo and his successors there is some gap of time,"
3912,II.,and a corresponding want of gradation. Yet the Sicilian poets of the
3913,II.,"courts of Hohenstauffen and Anjou, recognizable by their name or the"
3914,II.,"name of their town, Inghilfredi, Manfredi, Ranieri and Ruggierone da"
3915,II.,"Palermo, Tommaso and Matteo da Messina, Guglielmotto d' Otranto, Rinaldo"
3916,II.,"d'Aquino, Peir delle Vigne, either maintain altogether unchanged the"
3917,II.,"tone of the troubadours, or only gradually, as in the remarkable case of"
3918,II.,"the Notary of Lentino, approximate to the platonic poets of Tuscany. The"
3919,II.,"songs of the archetype of Sicilian singers, the Emperor Frederick II.,"
3920,II.,"are completely Provençal in feeling as in form, though infinitely"
3921,II.,inferior in execution. With him it is always the pleasure which he hopes
3922,II.,"from his lady, or the pleasure which he has had--""Quando ambidue stavamo"
3923,II.,"in allegranza alla dolce fera;"" ""Pregovi donna mia--Per vostra"
3924,II.,"cortesia--E pregovi che sia--Quello che lo core disia."" Again: ""Sospiro"
3925,II.,e sto in rancura--Ch' io son si disioso--E pauroso--Mi fate penare--Ma
3926,II.,tanto m' assicura--Lo suo viso amoroso--E lo gioioso--Riso e lo
3927,II.,sguardare--E lo parlare--Di questa criatura--Che per paura--Mi fate
3928,II.,penare--E di morare--Tant' è fina e pura--Tanto è saggia e cortese--Non
3929,II.,"credo che pensasse--Nè distornasse--Di ciò he m' impromise."" It is, this"
3930,II.,"earliest Italian poetry, like the more refined poetry of troubadours and"
3931,II.,"minnesingers, eminently an importuning of highborn but loosely living"
3932,II.,"women. From Sicily and Apulia poetry goes first, as might be expected"
3933,II.,"(and as probably sculpture went) to the seaport Pisa, thence to the"
3934,II.,"neighbouring Lucca, considerably before reaching Florence. And as it"
3935,II.,"becomes more Italian and urban, it becomes also, under the strict"
3936,II.,"vigilance of burgher husbands, considerably more platonic. In Bologna,"
3937,II.,"the city of jurists, it acquires (the remark is not mine merely, but"
3938,II.,belongs also to Carducci) the very strong flavour of legal quibbling
3939,II.,which distinguishes the otherwise charming Guido Guinicelli; and once in
3940,II.,"Florence, among the most subtle of all subtle Tuscans, it becomes at"
3941,II.,"once what it remained even for Dante, saturated with metaphysics: the"
3942,II.,"woman is no longer paramount, she is subordinated to Love himself; to"
3943,II.,"that personified abstraction Amor, the serious and melancholy son of"
3944,II.,pagan philosophy and Christian mysticism. The Tuscans had imported from
3945,II.,"Provence and Sicily the new element of mediæval love, of life devotion,"
3946,II.,"soul absorption in loving; if they would sing, they must sing of this;"
3947,II.,"any other kind of love, at a time when Italy still read and relished her"
3948,II.,"would-be Provençals, Lanfranc Cicala and Sordel of Mantua, would have"
3949,II.,"been unfashionable and unendurable. But in these Italian commonwealths,"
3950,II.,"as we have seen, poets are forced, nilly-willy, to be platonic; an"
3951,II.,importuning poem found in her work-basket may send a Tuscan lady into a
3952,II.,"convent, or, like Pia, into the Maremma; an _alba_ or a _serena_"
3953,II.,"interrupted by a wool-weaver of Calimara or a silk spinner of Lucca, may"
3954,II.,mean that the imprudent poet be found weltering in blood under some
3955,II.,archway the next morning. The chivalric sentimentality of feudalism must
3956,II.,"be restrained; and little by little, under the pressure of such very"
3957,II.,"different social habits, it grows into a veritable platonic passion."
3958,II.,"Poets must sing, and in order that they sing, they must adore; so men"
3959,II.,"actually begin to seek out, and adore and make themselves happy and"
3960,II.,wretched about women from whom they can hope only social distinctions;
3961,II.,"and this purely æsthetic passion goes on by the side nay, rather on the"
3962,II.,"top, of their humdrum, conjugal life or loosest libertinage. Petrarch's"
3963,II.,bastards were born during the reign of Madonna Laura; and that they
3964,II.,"should have been, was no more a slight or infidelity to her than to the"
3965,II.,"other Madonna, the one in heaven. Laura had a right to only ideal"
3966,II.,sentiments ideal relations; the poet was at liberty to carry more
3967,II.,material preferences elsewhere.
3968,II.,
3969,II.,"But could such love as this exist, could it be genuine? To my mind,"
3970,II.,"indubitably. For there is, in all our perceptions and desires of"
3971,II.,"physical and moral beauty, an element of passion which is akin to love;"
3972,II.,"and there is, in all love that is not mere lust, a perception of, a"
3973,II.,"craving for, beauty, real or imaginary which is identical with our"
3974,II.,"merely æsthetic perceptions and cravings; hence the possibility, once"
3975,II.,"the wish for such a passion present, of a kind of love which is mainly"
3976,II.,"æsthetic, which views the beloved as gratifying merely to the wish for"
3977,II.,"physical or spiritual loveliness, and concentrates upon one exquisite"
3978,II.,"reality all dreams of ideal perfection. Moreover there comes, to all"
3979,II.,"nobler natures, a love dawning: a brightening and delicate flushing of"
3980,II.,the soul before the actual appearance of the beloved one above the
3981,II.,"horizon, which is as beautiful and fascinating in its very clearness,"
3982,II.,"pallor, and coldness, as the unearthly purity of the pale amber and"
3983,II.,green and ashy rose which streaks the heavens before sunrise. The love
3984,II.,"of the early Tuscan poets (for we must count Guinicelli, in virtue of"
3985,II.,"his language, as a Tuscan) had been restrained, by social necessities"
3986,II.,"first, then by habit and deliberate æsthetic choice, within the limits"
3987,II.,"of this dawning state; and in this state, it had fed itself off mere"
3988,II.,"spiritual food, and acquired the strange intensity of mere intellectual"
3989,II.,"passions. We give excessive weight, in our days, to spontaneity in all"
3990,II.,"things, apt to think that only the accidental, the unsought, can be"
3991,II.,"vital; but it is true in many things, and truest in all matters of the"
3992,II.,"imagination and the heart, that the desire to experience any sentiment"
3993,II.,"will powerfully conduce to its production, and even give it a strength"
3994,II.,due to the long incubation of the wish. Thus the ideal love of the
3995,II.,"Tuscan poets was probably none the weaker, but rather the stronger, for"
3996,II.,"the desire which they felt to sing such passion; nay, rather to hear it"
3997,II.,"singing in themselves. The love of man and wife, of bride and"
3998,II.,"bridegroom, was still of the domain of prose; adulterous love forbidden;"
3999,II.,"and the tradition of, the fervent wish for, the romantic passion of the"
4000,II.,troubadours consumed them as a strong artistic craving. Platonic love
4001,II.,"was possible, doubly possible in souls tense with poetic wants; it"
4002,II.,became a reality through the strength of the wish for it.
4003,II.,
4004,II.,"Nor was this all. In all imaginative passions, intellectual motives are"
4005,II.,so much fuel; and in this case the necessity of logically explaining the
4006,II.,"bodiless passion for a platonic lady, of understanding why they felt in"
4007,II.,"a manner so hitherto unknown to gross mankind, tended greatly to"
4008,II.,"increase the love of these Tuscans, and to bring it in its chastity to"
4009,II.,"the pitch of fervour of more fleshly passions, by mingling with the"
4010,II.,æsthetic emotions already in their souls the mystical theorizings of
4011,II.,"transcendental metaphysics, and the half-human, half-supernatural"
4012,II.,ecstasy of mediæval religion. For we must remember that Italy was a
4013,II.,"country not merely of manufacturers and bankers, but of philosophers"
4014,II.,also and of saints.
4015,II.,
4016,II.,Among the Italians of the thirteenth century the revival of antique
4017,II.,"literature was already in full swing; while in France, Germany, and"
4018,II.,"Provence there had been, in lyric poetry at least, no trace of classic"
4019,II.,lore. Whereas the trouvères and troubadours had possessed but the light
4020,II.,intellectual luggage of a military aristocracy; and the minnesingers
4021,II.,"had, for the most part, been absolutely ignorant of reading and writing"
4022,II.,"(Wolfram says so of himself, and Ulrich von Liechtenstein relates how he"
4023,II.,carried about his lady's letter for days unread until the return of his
4024,II.,"secretary); the poets of Italy, from Brunetto Latini to Petrarch, were"
4025,II.,"eminently scholars; men to whom, however much they might be politicians"
4026,II.,"and ringleaders, like Cavalcanti, Donati, and Dante, whatever existed of"
4027,II.,antique learning was thoroughly well known. Such men were familiar with
4028,II.,whatever yet survived of the transcendental theories of Plato and
4029,II.,Plotinus; and they seized at once upon the mythic metaphysics of an
4030,II.,"antenatal condition, of typical ideas, of the divine essence of beauty,"
4031,II.,"on all the mystic discussions on love and on the soul, as a"
4032,II.,philosophical explanation of their seemingly inexplicable passion for an
4033,II.,"unapproachable woman. The lady upon whom the poetic fervour, the"
4034,II.,"mediæval love, inherited from Provence and France, was now expended, and"
4035,II.,whom social reasons placed quite beyond the reach of anything save the
4036,II.,"poet's soul and words, was evidently beloved for the sake of that much"
4037,II.,of the divine essence contained in her nature; she was loved for purely
4038,II.,"spiritual reasons, loved as a visible and living embodiment of virtue"
4039,II.,"and beauty, as a human piece of the godhead. So far, therefore, from"
4040,II.,"such an attachment being absurd, as absurd it would have seemed to"
4041,II.,"troubadours and minnesingers, who never served a lady save for what they"
4042,II.,"called a reward; it became, in the eyes of these platonizing Italians,"
4043,II.,"the triumph of the well-bred soul; and as such, soon after, a necessary"
4044,II.,"complement to dignities, talents, and wealth, the very highest"
4045,II.,occupation of a liberal mind. Thus did their smattering of platonic and
4046,II.,neo-platonic philosophy supply the Tuscan poets with a logical reality
4047,II.,for this otherwise unreal passion.
4048,II.,
4049,II.,But there was something more. In this democratic and philosophizing
4050,II.,"Italy, there was not the gulf which separated the chivalric poets, men"
4051,II.,"of the sword and not of books, from the great world of religious"
4052,II.,"mysticism; for, though the minnesingers especially were extremely devout"
4053,II.,"and sang many a strange love-song to the Virgin; they knew, they could"
4054,II.,"know, nothing of the contemplative religion of Eckhardt and his"
4055,II.,"disciples--humble and transcendental spirits, whose words were treasured"
4056,II.,"by the sedentary, dreamy townsfolk of the Rhine, but would have conveyed"
4057,II.,"no meaning even to the poet of the Grail epic, with its battles and"
4058,II.,"feasts, its booted and spurred slapdash morality, Wolfram von"
4059,II.,"Eschenbach. In the great manufacturing cities of Italy, such religious"
4060,II.,mysticism spread as it could never spread in feudal courts; it became
4061,II.,"familiar, both in the mere passionate sermons and songs of the wandering"
4062,II.,"friars, and in the subtle dialectics of the divines; above all, it"
4063,II.,became familiar to the poets. Now the essence of this contemplative
4064,II.,"theology of the Middle Ages, which triumphantly held its own against the"
4065,II.,"cut-and-dry argumentation of scholastic rationalism, was love. Love"
4066,II.,which assuredly meant different things to different minds; a passionate
4067,II.,benevolence towards man and beast to godlike simpletons like Francis of
4068,II.,Assisi; a mere creative and impassive activity of the divinity to
4069,II.,deep-seeing (so deep as to see only their own strange passionate eyes
4070,II.,and lips reflected in the dark well of knowledge) and almost pantheistic
4071,II.,"thinkers like Master Eckhardt; but love nevertheless, love. ""Amor,"
4072,II.,"amore, ardo d' amore,"" St. Francis had sung in a wild rhapsody, a sort"
4073,II.,"of mystic dance, a kind of furious _malagueña_ of divine love; and that"
4074,II.,"he who would wish to know God, let him love--""Qui vult habere notitiam"
4075,II.,"Dei, amet,"" had been written by Hugo of St. Victor, one of the subtlest"
4076,II.,"of all the mystics. ""Amor oculus est,"" said Master Eckhardt; love,"
4077,II.,"love--was not love then the highest of all human faculties, and must not"
4078,II.,"the act of loving, of perceiving God's essence in some creature which"
4079,II.,"had virtue, the soul's beauty, and beauty, the body's virtue, be the"
4080,II.,noblest business of a noble life? Thus argued the poets; and their
4081,II.,"argument, half-passionate, half-scholastic, mixing Phædrus and"
4082,II.,"Bonaventura, the Schools of Alexandria and the Courts of Love of"
4083,II.,"Provence, resulted in adding all the fervid reality of philosophical and"
4084,II.,religious aspiration to their clear and cold phantom of disembodied love
4085,II.,of woman.
4086,II.,
4087,II.,"Little by little therefore, together with the carnal desires of"
4088,II.,"Provençals and Sicilians, the Tuscan poets put behind them those little"
4089,II.,"coquetries of style and manner, complications of metre and rhythm"
4090,II.,learned and fantastic as a woman's plaited and braided hair; those
4091,II.,"metaphors and similes, like bright flowers or shining golden ribbons"
4092,II.,dropped from the lady's bosom and head and eagerly snatched by the
4093,II.,"lover, which we still find, curiously transformed and scented with the"
4094,II.,"rosemary and thyme of country lanes, in the peasant poetry of modern"
4095,II.,Tuscany. Little by little does the love poetry of the Italians reject
4096,II.,"such ornaments; and cloth itself in that pale garment, pale and stately"
4097,II.,"in heavy folds like a nun's or friar's weeds, but pure and radiant and"
4098,II.,"solemn as the garment of some painted angel, which we have all learned"
4099,II.,"to know from the ""Vita Nuova."""
4100,II.,
4101,II.,To describe this poetry of the immediate precursors and contemporaries
4102,II.,of Dante is to the last degree difficult: it can be described only by
4103,II.,"symbols, and symbols can but mislead us. Dante Rossetti himself, after"
4104,II.,"translating with exquisite beauty the finest poems of this school,"
4105,II.,"showed how he had read into them his own spirit, when he drew the"
4106,II.,beautiful design for the frontispiece of his collection. These two
4107,II.,"lovers--the youth kneeling in his cloth of silver robe, lifting his long"
4108,II.,"throbbing neck towards the beloved; the lady stooping down towards him,"
4109,II.,"raising him up and kissing him; the mingled cloud of waving hair, the"
4110,II.,"four tight-clasped hands, the four tightly glued lips, the profile"
4111,II.,"hidden by the profile, the passion and the pathos, the eager, wistful"
4112,II.,"faces, nay, the very splendour of brocade robes and jewels, the very"
4113,II.,sweetness of blooming rose spaliers; all this is suitable to illustrate
4114,II.,"this group of sonnets or that of the ""House of Life;"" but it is false,"
4115,II.,"false in efflorescence and luxuriance of passion, splendour and colour"
4116,II.,"of accessory, to the poetry of these early Tuscans. Imaginative their"
4117,II.,"poetry certainly is, and passionate; indeed the very concentration of"
4118,II.,imaginative passion; but imagination and passion unlike those of all
4119,II.,other poets; perhaps because more rigorously reduced to their elements:
4120,II.,"imagination purely of the heart, passion purely of the intellect,"
4121,II.,"neither of the senses: love in its most essential condition, but, just"
4122,II.,"because an essence, purged of earthly alloys, rarefied, sublimated into"
4123,II.,a cultus or a philosophy.
4124,II.,
4125,II.,"These poems might nearly all have been written by one man, were it"
4126,II.,possible for one man to vary from absolute platitude to something like
4127,II.,"genius, so homogeneous is their tone: everywhere do we meet the same"
4128,II.,simplicity of diction struggling with the same complication and subtlety
4129,II.,"of thought, the same abstract speculation strangely mingled with most"
4130,II.,"individual and personal pathos. The mode of thinking and feeling, the"
4131,II.,"conception of all the large characteristics of love, and of all its"
4132,II.,"small incidents are, in this _cycle_ of poets, constantly the same; and"
4133,II.,"they are the same in the ""Vita Nuova;"" Dante having, it would seem,"
4134,II.,invented and felt nothing unknown to his immediate predecessors and
4135,II.,"contemporaries, but merely concentrated their thoughts and feelings by"
4136,II.,the greater intenseness of his genius. This platonic love of Dante's
4137,II.,"days is, as I have said, a passion sublimated into a philosophy and a"
4138,II.,cultus. The philosophy of love engages much of these poets' attention;
4139,II.,"all have treated of it, but Guido Cavalcanti, Dante's elder brother in"
4140,II.,"poetry, is love's chief theologian. He explains, as Eckhardt or"
4141,II.,"Bonaventura might explain the mysteries of God's being and will, the"
4142,II.,"nature and operation of love. ""Love, which enamours us of excellence,"
4143,II.,"arises out of pure virtue of the soul, and equals us to God,"" he tells"
4144,II.,"us; and subtly developes his theme. This being the case, nothing can be"
4145,II.,"more mistaken than to suppose, as do those of little sense, that Love is"
4146,II.,"blind, and goes blindly about (""Da sentir poco, e da credenza vana--Si"
4147,II.,move il dir di cotal grossa gente--Ch' amor fa cieco andar per lo suo
4148,II.,"regno""). Love is omniscient, since love is born of the knowledge and"
4149,II.,recognition of excellence. Such love as this is the only true source of
4150,II.,"happiness, since it alone raises man to the level of the divinity."
4151,II.,Cavalcanti has in him not merely the subtlety but the scornfulness of a
4152,II.,great divine. His wrath against all those who worship or defend a
4153,II.,"different god of Love knows no bounds. ""I know not what to say of him"
4154,II.,who adores the goddess born of Saturn and sea-foam. His love is fire: it
4155,II.,"seems sweet, but its result is bitter and evil. He may indeed call"
4156,II.,himself happy; but in such delights he mingles himself with much
4157,II.,"baseness."" Such is this god of Love, who, when he descended into Dante's"
4158,II.,"heart, caused the spirit of life to tremble terribly in his secret"
4159,II.,"chamber, and trembling to cry, ""Lo, here is a god stronger than myself,"
4160,II.,"who coming will rule over me. Ecce Deus fortior me, qui veniens"
4161,II.,"dominabitur mihi!"""
4162,II.,
4163,II.,"The god, this chaste and formidable archangel Amor, is the true subject"
4164,II.,of these poets' adoration; the woman into whom he descends by a mystic
4165,II.,miracle of beauty and of virtue becomes henceforward invested with
4166,II.,"somewhat of his awful radiance. She is a gentle, gracious lady; a"
4167,II.,"lovable and loving woman, in describing whose grey-green eyes and colour"
4168,II.,"as of snow tinted with pomegranate, the older Tuscans would fain linger,"
4169,II.,"comparing her to the new-budded rose, to the morning star, to the golden"
4170,II.,"summer air, to the purity of snowflakes falling silently in a serene"
4171,II.,sky; but the sense of the divinity residing within her becomes too
4172,II.,strong. From her eyes dart spirits who strike awe into the heart; from
4173,II.,her lips come words which make men sigh; on her passage the poet casts
4174,II.,"down his eyes; notions, all these, with which we are familiar from the"
4175,II.,"""Vita Nuova;"" but which belong to Cavalcanti, Lapo Gianni, nay, even to"
4176,II.,"Guinicelli, quite as much as to Dante. The poet bids his verse go forth"
4177,II.,"to her, but softly; and stand before her with bended head, as before the"
4178,II.,"Mother of God. She is a miracle herself, a thing sent from heaven, a"
4179,II.,"spirit, as Dante says in that most beautiful of all his sonnets, the"
4180,II.,summing up of all that the poets of his circle had said of their
4181,II.,"lady--""Tanto gentile e tanto onesta pare."""
4182,II.,
4183,II.,"""She passes along the street so beautiful and gracious,"" says"
4184,II.,"Guinicelli, ""that she humbles pride in all whom she greets, and makes"
4185,II.,him of our faith if he does not yet believe. And no base man can come
4186,II.,into her presence. And I will tell you another virtue of her: no man can
4187,II.,"think ought of evil as long as he looks upon her."" ""The noble mind which"
4188,II.,"I feel, on account of this youthful lady who has appeared, makes me"
4189,II.,"despise baseness and vileness,"" says Lapo Gianni. The women who surround"
4190,II.,"her are glorified in her glory, glorified in their womanhood and"
4191,II.,"companionship with her. ""The ladies around you,"" says Cavalcanti, ""are"
4192,II.,dear to me for the sake of your love; and I pray them as they are
4193,II.,"courteous, that they should do you all honour."" She is, indeed, scarcely"
4194,II.,"a woman, and something more than a saint: an avatar, an incarnation of"
4195,II.,"that Amor who is born of virtue and beauty, and raises men's minds to"
4196,II.,heaven; and when Cavalcanti speaks of his lady's portrait behind the
4197,II.,"blazing tapers of Orsanmichele, it seems but natural that she should be"
4198,II.,"on an altar, in the Madonna's place. The idea of a mysterious"
4199,II.,"incarnation of love in the lady, or of a mystic relationship between her"
4200,II.,"and love, returns to these poets. Lapo Gianni tells us first that she is"
4201,II.,"Amor's sister, then speaks of her as Amor's bride; nay, in this love"
4202,II.,"theology of the thirteenth century, arises the same kind of confusion as"
4203,II.,"in the mystic disputes of the nature of the Godhead. A Sienese poet, Ugo"
4204,II.,"da Massa, goes so far as to say, ""Amor and I are all one thing; and we"
4205,II.,"have one will and one heart; and if I were not, Amor were not; mind you,"
4206,II.,do not think I am saying these things from subtlety ('e non pensate ch'
4207,II.,"io 'l dica per arte'); for certainly it is true that I am love, and he"
4208,II.,"who should slay me would slay love."""
4209,II.,
4210,II.,"Together with the knowledge of public life and of scholastic theories,"
4211,II.,"together with the love of occult and cabalistic science, and the craft"
4212,II.,"of Provençal poetry, Dante received from his Florence of the thirteenth"
4213,II.,"century the knowledge of this new, this exotic and esoteric intellectual"
4214,II.,"love. And, as it is the mission of genius to gather into an undying"
4215,II.,"whole, to model into a perfect form, the thoughts and feelings and"
4216,II.,"perceptions of the less highly endowed men who surround it, so Dante"
4217,II.,"moulded out of the love passion and love philosophy of his day the ""Vita"
4218,II.,"Nuova."" Whether the story narrated in this book is fact; whether a real"
4219,II.,woman whom he called Beatrice ever existed; some of those praiseworthy
4220,II.,"persons, who prowl in the charnel-house of the past, and put its poor"
4221,II.,"fleshless bones into the acids and sublimates of their laboratory, have"
4222,II.,gravely doubted. But such doubts cannot affect us. For if the story of
4223,II.,"the ""Vita Nuova"" be a romance, and if Beatrice be a mere romance"
4224,II.,"heroine, the real meaning and value of the book does not change in our"
4225,II.,"eyes; since, to concoct such a tale, Dante must have had a number of"
4226,II.,real experiences which are fully the tale's equivalent; and to conceive
4227,II.,"and create such a figure as Beatrice, and such a passion as she inspires"
4228,II.,"her poet, he must have felt as a poignant reality the desire for such a"
4229,II.,"lady, the capacity for such a love. A tale merely of the soul, and of"
4230,II.,"the soul's movements and actions, this ""Vita Nuova;"" so why should it"
4231,II.,"matter if that which could never exist save in the spirit, should have"
4232,II.,"been but the spirit's creation? It is, in its very intensity, a vision"
4233,II.,of love; what if it be a vision merely conceived and never realized?
4234,II.,Hence the futility of all those who wish to destroy our faith and
4235,II.,"pleasure by saying ""all this never took place."" Fools, can you tell what"
4236,II.,"did or did not take place in a poet's mind? Be this as it may, the ""Vita"
4237,II.,"Nuova,"" thank heaven, exists; and, thank heaven, exists as a reality to"
4238,II.,"our feelings. The longed-for ideal, the perfection whose love, said"
4239,II.,"Cavalcanti, raises us up to God, has seemed to gather itself into a"
4240,II.,human shape; and a real being has been surrounded by the halo of
4241,II.,perfection emanated from the poet's own soul. The vague visions of glory
4242,II.,"have suddenly taken body in this woman, seen rarely, at a distance; the"
4243,II.,"woman whom, as a child, the poet, himself a child, had already looked at"
4244,II.,"with the strange, ideal fascination which we sometimes experience in our"
4245,II.,"childhood. People are apt to smile at this opening of the ""Vita Nuova;"""
4246,II.,to put aside this narrative of childish love together with the pathetic
4247,II.,"little pedantries of learned poetry and Kabbala, of the long gloses to"
4248,II.,"each poem, and the elaborate calculations of the recurrence and"
4249,II.,combination of the number nine (and that curious little bit of
4250,II.,encyclopædic display about the Syrian month _Tismin_) as so much pretty
4251,II.,local colouring or obsolete silliness. But there is nothing at which to
4252,II.,"laugh in such childish fascinations; the wonderful, the perfect, is more"
4253,II.,"open to us as children than it is afterwards: a word, a picture, a"
4254,II.,"snatch of music will have for us an ineffable, mysterious meaning; and"
4255,II.,"how much more so some human being, often some other, more brilliant"
4256,II.,"child from whose immediate contact we are severed by some circumstance,"
4257,II.,"perhaps by our own consciousness of inferiority, which makes that other"
4258,II.,"appear strangely distant, above us, moving in a world of glory which we"
4259,II.,"scarcely hope to approach; a child sometimes, or sometimes some grown"
4260,II.,"person, beautiful, brilliant, who sings or talks or looks at us, the"
4261,II.,"child, with ways which we do not understand, like some fairy or goddess."
4262,II.,"No indeed, there is nothing to laugh at in this, in this first"
4263,II.,"blossoming of that love for higher and more beautiful things, which in"
4264,II.,"most of us is trodden down, left to wither, by our maturer selves;"
4265,II.,"nothing to make us laugh; nay, rather to make us sigh that later on we"
4266,II.,"see too well, see others too much on their real level, scrutinize too"
4267,II.,"much; too much, alas, for what at best is but an imperfect creature. And"
4268,II.,in this state of fascination does the child Dante see the child
4269,II.,"Beatrice, as a strange, glorious little vision from a childish sphere"
4270,II.,"quite above him; treasuring up that vision, till with his growth it"
4271,II.,"expands and grows more beautiful and noble, but none the less"
4272,II.,"fascinating and full of awfulness. When, therefore, the grave young"
4273,II.,"poet, full of the yearning for Paradise (but Paradise vaguer, sweeter,"
4274,II.,less metaphysic and theological than the Paradise of his manhood); as
4275,II.,"yet but a gracious, learned youth, his terrible moral muscle still"
4276,II.,"undeveloped by struggle, the noble and delicate dreamer of Giotto's"
4277,II.,"fresco, with the long, thin, almost womanish face, marked only by dreamy"
4278,II.,"eyes and lips, wandering through this young Florence of the Middle"
4279,II.,"Ages--when, I say, he meets after long years, the noble and gentle"
4280,II.,"woman, serious and cheerful and candid; and is told that she is that"
4281,II.,same child who was the queen and goddess of his childish fancies; then
4282,II.,the vague glory with which his soul is filled expands and enwraps the
4283,II.,"beloved figure, so familiar and yet so new. And the blood retreats from"
4284,II.,"his veins, and he trembles; and a vague god within him, half allegory,"
4285,II.,"half reality, cries out to him that a new life for him has begun."
4286,II.,"Beatrice has become the ideal; Beatrice, the real woman, has ceased to"
4287,II.,"exist; the Beatrice of his imagination only remains, a piece of his own"
4288,II.,"soul embodied in a gracious and beautiful reality, which he follows,"
4289,II.,"seeks, but never tries to approach. Of the real woman he asks nothing;"
4290,II.,"no word throughout the ""Vita Nuova"" of entreaty or complaint, no shadow"
4291,II.,"of desire, not a syllable of those reproaches of cruelty which Petrarch"
4292,II.,"is for ever showering upon Laura. He desires nothing of Beatrice, and"
4293,II.,"Beatrice cannot act wrongly; she is perfection, and perfection makes him"
4294,II.,"who contemplates humble at once and proud, glorifying his spirit. Once,"
4295,II.,"indeed, he would wish that she might listen to him; he has reason to"
4296,II.,"think that he has fallen in her esteem, has seemed base and uncourteous"
4297,II.,"in her eyes, and he would explain. But he does not wish to address her;"
4298,II.,it never occurs to him that she can ever feel in any way towards him; it
4299,II.,is enough that he feels towards her. Let her go by and smile and
4300,II.,graciously salute her friends: the sight of her grave and pure
4301,II.,"regalness, nay, rather divinity, of womanhood, suffices for his joy;"
4302,II.,"nay, later the consciousness comes upon him that it is sufficient to"
4303,II.,"know of her existence and of his love even without seeing her. And, as"
4304,II.,"must be the case in such ideal passion, where the action is wholly in"
4305,II.,"the mind of the lover, he is at first ashamed, afraid; he feels a terror"
4306,II.,"lest his love, if known to her, should excite her scorn; a horror lest"
4307,II.,"it be misunderstood and befouled by the jests of those around him, even"
4308,II.,of those same gentle women to whom he afterwards addresses his praise of
4309,II.,Beatrice. He is afraid of exposing to the air of reality this ideal
4310,II.,flower of passion. But the moment comes when he can hide it no longer;
4311,II.,"and, behold, the passion flower of his soul opens out more gloriously in"
4312,II.,"the sunlight of the world. He is proud of his passion, of his worship;"
4313,II.,he feels the dignity and glory of being the priest of such a love. The
4314,II.,"women all round, the beautiful, courteous women, of whom, only just"
4315,II.,"now, he was so dreadfully afraid, become his friends and confidants;"
4316,II.,"they are quite astonished (half in love, perhaps, with the young poet)"
4317,II.,"at this strange way of loving; they sympathize, admire, are in love with"
4318,II.,"his love for Beatrice. And to them he speaks of her rather than to men,"
4319,II.,for the womanhood which they share with his lady consecrates them in his
4320,II.,"eyes; and they, without jealousy towards this ideal woman, though"
4321,II.,"perhaps not without longing for this ideal love, listen as they might"
4322,II.,"listen to some new and unaccountably sweet music, touched and honoured,"
4323,II.,"and feeling towards Dante as towards some beautiful, half-mad thing. He"
4324,II.,"talks of her, sings of her, and is happy; the strangest thing in this"
4325,II.,intensely real narrative of real love is this complete satisfaction of
4326,II.,"the passion in its own existence, this complete absence of all desire or"
4327,II.,"hope. But this happiness is interrupted by the sudden, terrible thought"
4328,II.,"that one day all this must cease; the horrible, logical necessity coming"
4329,II.,"straight home to him, that one day she must die--""Di necessità conviene"
4330,II.,"che la gentilissima Beatrice alcuna volta si muoia."" There is nothing"
4331,II.,"truer, more intensely pathetic, in all literature, than this frightful"
4332,II.,"pang of evil, not real, but first imagined; this frightful nightmare"
4333,II.,vision of the end coming when reality is still happy. Have we not all of
4334,II.,us at one time felt the horrible shudder of that sudden perception that
4335,II.,"happiness must end; that the beloved, the living, must die; that this"
4336,II.,"thing the present, which we clasp tight with our arms, which throbs"
4337,II.,"against our breast, will in but few moments be gone, vanished, leaving"
4338,II.,us to grasp mere phantom recollections? Compared with this the blow of
4339,II.,"the actual death of Beatrice is gentle. And then, the truthfulness of"
4340,II.,"his narration how, with yearning, empty heart, hungering after those"
4341,II.,"poor lost realities of happiness, after that occasional glimpse of his"
4342,II.,"lady, that rare catching of her voice, that blessed consciousness of her"
4343,II.,"existence, he little by little lets himself be consoled, cradled to"
4344,II.,"sleep like a child which has sobbed itself out, in the sympathy, the"
4345,II.,"vague love, of another--the Donna della Finestra--with whom he speaks of"
4346,II.,"Beatrice; and the sudden, terrified, starting up and shaking off of any"
4347,II.,"such base consolation, the wrath at any such mental infidelity to the"
4348,II.,"dead one, the indignant impatience with his own weakness, with his"
4349,II.,baseness in not understanding that it is enough that Beatrice has lived
4350,II.,"and that he has loved her, in not feeling that the glory and joy of the"
4351,II.,ineffaceable past is sufficient for all present and future. A revolution
4352,II.,"in himself which gradually merges in that grave final resolve, that"
4353,II.,"sudden seeing how Beatrice can be glorified by him, that solemn, quiet,"
4354,II.,brief determination not to say any more of her as yet; not till he can
4355,II.,"show her transfigured in Paradise. ""After this sonnet there appeared"
4356,II.,"unto me a marvellous vision, in which I beheld things that made me"
4357,II.,"propose unto myself to speak no more of this blessed one, until the"
4358,II.,time when I might more worthily treat of her. And that this may come to
4359,II.,"pass, I strive with all my endeavour, even as she truly knows it. Thus,"
4360,II.,"if it should please Him, through whom all things do live, that my life"
4361,II.,"continue for several more years, I hope to say of her such things as"
4362,II.,"have never been said of any lady. And then may it please Him, who is the"
4363,II.,"lord of all courtesy, that my soul shall go forth to see the glory of"
4364,II.,"its lady, that is to say, of that blessed Beatrice, who gloriously looks"
4365,II.,"up into the face of Him, _qui est per omnia sæcula benedictus_"""
4366,II.,
4367,II.,"Thus ends the ""Vita Nuova;"" a book, to find any equivalent for whose"
4368,II.,"reality and completeness of passion, though it is passion for a woman"
4369,II.,"whom the poet scarcely knows and of whom he desires nothing, we must go"
4370,II.,"back to the merest fleshly love of Antiquity, of Sappho or Catullus; for"
4371,II.,modern times are too hesitating and weak. So at least it seems; but in
4372,II.,"fact, if we only think over the matter, we shall find that in no earthly"
4373,II.,love can we find this reality and completeness: it is possible only in
4374,II.,love like Dante's. For there can be no unreality in it: it is a reality
4375,II.,"of the imagination, and leaves, with all its mysticism and idealism, no"
4376,II.,"room for falsehood. Any other kind of love may be set aside, silenced,"
4377,II.,by the activity of the mind; this love of Dante's constitutes that very
4378,II.,"activity. And, after reading that last page which I have above"
4379,II.,"transcribed, as those closing Latin words echo through our mind like the"
4380,II.,"benediction from an altar, we feel as if we were rising from our knees"
4381,II.,"in some secret chapel, bright with tapers and dim with incense; among a"
4382,II.,"crowd kneeling like ourselves; yet solitary, conscious of only the glory"
4383,II.,"we have seen and tasted, of that love _qui est per omnia scecula"
4384,II.,benedictus._
4385,II.,
4386,II.,
4387,III.,III.
4388,III.,
4389,III.,"But is it right that we should feel thus? Is it right that love,"
4390,III.,containing within itself the potentialities of so many things so sadly
4391,III.,"needed in this cold real world, as patience, tenderness, devotion, and"
4392,III.,loving-kindness--is it right that love should thus be carried away out
4393,III.,"of ordinary life and enclosed, a sacred thing for contemplation, in the"
4394,III.,"shrine or chapel of an imaginary Beatrice? And, on the other hand, is it"
4395,III.,"right that into the holy places of our soul, the places where we should"
4396,III.,come face to face with the unattainable ideal of our own conduct that we
4397,III.,may strive after something nobler than mere present pleasure and
4398,III.,"profit--is it right that into such holy places, destined but for an"
4399,III.,"abstract perfection, there should be placed a mere half-unknown, vaguely"
4400,III.,"seen woman? In short, is not this ""Vita Nuova"" a mere false ideal, one"
4401,III.,"of those works of art which, because they are beautiful, get worshipped"
4402,III.,as holy?
4403,III.,
4404,III.,"This question is a grave one, and worthy to make us pause. The world is"
4405,III.,full of instances of the fatal waste of feelings misapplied: of human
4406,III.,"affections, human sympathy and compassion, so terribly necessary to"
4407,III.,"man, wasted in various religious systems, upon Christ and God: of"
4408,III.,"religious aspirations, contemplation, worship, and absorption, necessary"
4409,III.,"to the improvement of the soul, wasted in various artistic or poetic"
4410,III.,"crazes upon mere pleasant works, or pleasant fancies, of man;"
4411,III.,"wastefulness of emotions, wastefulness of time, which constitute"
4412,III.,two-thirds of mankind's history and explain the vast amount of evil in
4413,III.,"past and present. The present question therefore becomes, is not this"
4414,III.,"""Vita Nuova"" merely another instance of this lamentable carrying off of"
4415,III.,precious feelings in channels where they result no longer in
4416,III.,"fertilization, but in corruption? The Middle Ages, especially, in its"
4417,III.,"religion, its philosophy, nay, in that very love of which I am writing,"
4418,III.,are one succession of such acts of wastefulness. This question has come
4419,III.,"to me many a time, and has left me in much doubt and trouble. But on"
4420,III.,reflection I am prepared to answer that such doubts as these may safely
4421,III.,"be cast behind us, and that we may trust that instinct which, whenever"
4422,III.,"we lay down the ""Vita Nuova,"" tells us that to have felt and loved this"
4423,III.,"book is one of those spiritual gains in our life which, come what may,"
4424,III.,can never be lost entirely.
4425,III.,
4426,III.,"The ""Vita Nuova"" represents the most exceptional of exceptional moral"
4427,III.,"and intellectual conditions. Dante's love for Beatrice is, in great"
4428,III.,"measure, to be regarded as an extraordinary and exquisite work of art,"
4429,III.,"produced not by the volition of man, but by the accidental combination"
4430,III.,of circumstances. It is no more suited to ordinary life than would a
4431,III.,golden and ivory goddess of Phidias be suited to be the wife of a mortal
4432,III.,"man. But it may not therefore be useless; nay, it may be of the highest"
4433,III.,"utility. It may serve that high utilitarian mission of all art, to"
4434,III.,"correct the real by the ideal, to mould the thing as it is in the"
4435,III.,"semblance of the thing as it should be. Herein, let it be remembered,"
4436,III.,"consists the value, the necessity of the abstract and the ideal. In the"
4437,III.,long history of evolution we have now reached the stage where selection
4438,III.,"is no longer in the mere hands of unconscious nature, but of conscious"
4439,III.,"or half-conscious man; who makes himself, or is made by mankind,"
4440,III.,"according to not merely physical necessities, but to the intellectual"
4441,III.,"necessity of realizing the ideal, of pursuing the object, of imitating"
4442,III.,"the model, before him. No man will ever find the living counterpart of"
4443,III.,"that chryselephantine goddess of the Greeks; ivory and gold, nay,"
4444,III.,"marble, fashioned by an artist, are one thing; flesh is another, and"
4445,III.,flesh fashioned by mere blind accident. But the man who should have
4446,III.,"beheld that Phidian goddess, who should have felt her full perfection,"
4447,III.,would not have been as easily satisfied as any other with a mere
4448,III.,"commonplace living woman; he would have sought--and seeking, would have"
4449,III.,had more likelihood of finding--the woman of flesh and blood who nearest
4450,III.,approached to that ivory and gold perfection. The case is similar with
4451,III.,"the ""Vita Nuova."" No earthly affection, no natural love of man for"
4452,III.,"woman, of an entire human being, body and soul, for another entire human"
4453,III.,"being, can ever be the counterpart of this passion for Beatrice, the"
4454,III.,passion of a mere mind for a mere mental ideal. But if the old
4455,III.,"lust-fattened evil of the world is to diminish rather than to increase,"
4456,III.,"why then every love of man for woman and of woman for man should tend,"
4457,III.,"to the utmost possibility, to resemble that love of the ""Vita Nuova."""
4458,III.,For mankind has gradually separated from brute kind merely by the
4459,III.,development of those possibilities of intellectual and moral passion
4460,III.,"which the animal has not got; an animal man will never cease to be, but"
4461,III.,"a man he can daily more and more become, until from the obscene"
4462,III.,"goat-legged and goat-faced creature which we commonly see, he has turned"
4463,III.,"into something like certain antique fauns: a beautiful creature, not"
4464,III.,"noticeably a beast, a beast in only the smallest portion of his nature."
4465,III.,"In order that this may come to pass--and its coming to pass means, let"
4466,III.,"us remember, the enormous increase of happiness and diminution of misery"
4467,III.,upon earth--it is necessary that day by day and year by year there
4468,III.,"should enter into man's feelings, emotions, and habits, into his whole"
4469,III.,"life, a greater proportion of that which is his own, and is not shared"
4470,III.,"by the animal; that his actions, preferences, the great bulk of his"
4471,III.,"conscious existence, should be busied with things of the soul, truth,"
4472,III.,"good, and beauty, and not with things of the body. Hence the love of"
4473,III.,such a gradually improving and humanizing man for a gradually improving
4474,III.,"and humanizing woman, should become, as much as is possible, a"
4475,III.,"connection of the higher and more human, rather than of the lower and"
4476,III.,"more bestial, portions of their nature; it should tend, in its"
4477,III.,"reciprocal stimulation, to make the man more a man, the woman more a"
4478,III.,"woman, to make both less of the mere male and female animals that they"
4479,III.,"were. In brief, love should increase, instead, like that which oftenest"
4480,III.,"profanes love's name, of diminishing, the power of aspiration, of"
4481,III.,"self-direction, of self-restraint, which may exist within us. Now to"
4482,III.,"tend to this is to tend towards the love of the ""Vita Nuova;"" to tend"
4483,III.,"towards the love of the ""Vita Nuova"" is to tend towards this. Say what"
4484,III.,"you will of the irresistible force of original constitution, it remains"
4485,III.,"certain, and all history is there as witness, that mankind--that is to"
4486,III.,"say, the only mankind in whom lies the initiative of good, mankind which"
4487,III.,can judge and select--possesses the faculty of feeling and acting in
4488,III.,accordance with its standard of feeling and action; the faculty in great
4489,III.,measure of becoming that which it thinks desirable to become. Now to
4490,III.,have perceived the even imaginary existence of such a passion as that of
4491,III.,"Dante for Beatrice, must be, for all who can perceive it, the first step"
4492,III.,towards attempting to bring into reality a something of that passion:
4493,III.,the real passion conceived while the remembrance of that ideal passion
4494,III.,"be still in the mind will bear to it a certain resemblance, even as,"
4495,III.,"according to the ancients, the children born of mothers whose rooms"
4496,III.,"contained some image of Apollo or Adonis would have in them a reflex,"
4497,III.,"however faint, of that beauty in whose presence they came into"
4498,III.,"existence. In short, it seems to me, that as the ""Vita Nuova"" embodies"
4499,III.,"the utmost ideal of absolutely spiritual love, and as to spiritualize"
4500,III.,"love must long remain one of the chief moral necessities of the world,"
4501,III.,"there exists in this book a moral force, a moral value, a power in its"
4502,III.,"unearthly passion and purity, which, as much as anything more"
4503,III.,"deliberately unselfish, more self-consciously ethical, we must"
4504,III.,acknowledge and honour as holy.
4505,III.,
4506,III.,"As the love of him who has read and felt the ""Vita Nuova"" cannot but"
4507,III.,"strive towards a purer nature, so also the love of which poets sang"
4508,III.,became also nobler as the influence of the strange Tuscan school of
4509,III.,"platonic lyrists spread throughout literature, bringing to men the"
4510,III.,knowledge of a kind of love born of that idealizing and worshipping
4511,III.,passion of the Middle Ages; but of mediæval love chastened by the
4512,III.,manners of stern democracy and passed through the sieve of Christian
4513,III.,"mysticism and pagan philosophy. Of this influence of the ""Vita"
4514,III.,"Nuova""--for the ""Vita Nuova"" had concentrated in itself all the"
4515,III.,intensest characteristics of Dante's immediate predecessors and
4516,III.,"contemporaries, causing them to become useless and forgotten--of this"
4517,III.,"influence of the ""Vita Nuova,"" there is perhaps no more striking example"
4518,III.,"than that of the poet who, constituted by nature to be the mere"
4519,III.,"continuator of the romantically gallant tradition of the troubadours,"
4520,III.,"became, and hence his importance and glory, the mediator between Dante"
4521,III.,"and the centuries which followed him; the man who gave to mankind,"
4522,III.,incapable as yet of appreciating or enduring the spiritual essence of
4523,III.,"the ""Vita Nuova,"" that self-same essence of intellectual love in an"
4524,III.,"immortal dilution. I speak, of course, of Petrarch. His passion is"
4525,III.,"neither ideal nor strong. The man is in love, or has been in love,"
4526,III.,"existing on a borderland of loving and not loving, with the beautiful"
4527,III.,"woman. His elegant, refined, half-knightly, half-scholarly, and"
4528,III.,altogether courtly mind is delighted with her; with her curly yellow
4529,III.,"hair, her good red and white beauty (we are never even told that Dante's"
4530,III.,"Beatrice is beautiful, yet how much lovelier is she not than this Laura,"
4531,III.,descended from all the golden-haired bright-eyed ladies of the
4532,III.,"troubadours!), with her manner, her amiability, her purity and dignity"
4533,III.,in this ecclesiastical Babylon called Avignon. He maintains a
4534,III.,"semi-artificial love; frequenting her house, writing sonnet after"
4535,III.,"sonnet, rhetorical exercises, studies from the antique and the"
4536,III.,"Provençal, for the most part; he, who was born to be a mere troubadour"
4537,III.,"like Ventadour or Folquet, becomes, through the influence of Dante, the"
4538,III.,"type of the poet Abate, of the poetic _cavaliere servente_; a good, weak"
4539,III.,"man with aspirations, who, failing to get the better of Laura's virtue,"
4540,III.,"doubtless consoles himself elsewhere, but returns to an habitual"
4541,III.,"contemplation of it. He is, being constitutionally a troubadour, an"
4542,III.,"Italian priest turned partly Provençal, vexed at her not becoming his"
4543,III.,"mistress; then (having made up his mind, which was but little set upon"
4544,III.,"her), quite pleased at her refusal: it turns her into a kind of"
4545,III.,"Beatrice, and him, poor man, heaven help him! into a kind of Dante--a"
4546,III.,"Dante for the use of the world at large. He goes on visiting Laura, and"
4547,III.,"writing to her a sonnet regularly so many times a week, and the best,"
4548,III.,"carefully selected, we feel distinctly persuaded, at regular intervals."
4549,III.,"It is a determined cultus, a sort of half-real affectation, something"
4550,III.,equivalent to lighting a lamp before a very well-painted and very
4551,III.,"conspicuous shrine. All his humanities, all his Provençal lore go into"
4552,III.,these poems--written for whom? For her? Decidedly; for she has no reason
4553,III.,"not to read the effusions of this amiable, weak priestlet; she feels"
4554,III.,nothing for him. For her; but doubtless also to be handed round in
4555,III.,"society; a new sonnet or canzone by that charming and learned man, the"
4556,III.,Abate Petrarch. There is considerable emptiness in all this: he praises
4557,III.,"Laura's chastity, then grows impatient, then praises her again; adores"
4558,III.,"her, calls her cruel, his goddess, his joy, his torment; he does not"
4559,III.,"really want her, but in the vacuity of his feeling, thinks he does;"
4560,III.,"calls her alternately the flat, abusive, and eulogistic names which mean"
4561,III.,nothing. He plays loud and soft with this absence of desire; he fiddle
4562,III.,"faddles in descriptions of her, not passionate or burning, but"
4563,III.,delicately undressed: he sees her (but with chaste eyes) in her bath;
4564,III.,"he envies her veil, &c.; he neither violently intellectually embraces,"
4565,III.,"nor humbly bows down in imagination before her; he trifles gracefully,"
4566,III.,"modestly, half-familiarly, with her finger tips, with the locks of her"
4567,III.,"hair, and so forth. Fancy Dante abusing Beatrice; fancy Dante talking of"
4568,III.,Beatrice in her bath; the mere idea of his indignation and shame makes
4569,III.,one shameful and indignant at the thought. But this perfect Laura is no
4570,III.,"Beatrice, or only a half-and-half sham one. She is no ideal figure,"
4571,III.,"merely a figure idealized; this is no imaginative passion, merely an"
4572,III.,"unreal one. Compare, for instance, the suggestion of Laura's possible"
4573,III.,death with the suggestion of the possible death of Beatrice. Petrarch
4574,III.,does not love sufficiently to guess what such a loss would be. Then
4575,III.,Laura does die. Here Petrarch rises. The severing of the dear old
4576,III.,"habits, the absence of the sweet reality, the terrible sense that all is"
4577,III.,"over, Death, the great poetizer and giver of love philters, all this"
4578,III.,makes him love Laura as he never loved her before. The poor weak
4579,III.,"creature, who cannot, like a troubadour, go seek a new mistress when the"
4580,III.,"old one fails him, feels dreadfully alone, the world dreadfully dreary"
4581,III.,"around him; he sits down and cries, and his crying is genuine, making"
4582,III.,"the tears come also into our eyes. And Laura, as she becomes a more"
4583,III.,"distant ideal, becomes nobler, though noble with only a faint earthly"
4584,III.,"graciousness not comparable to the glory of the living Beatrice. And,"
4585,III.,"as he goes on, growing older and weaker and more desolate, the thought"
4586,III.,"of a glorified Laura (as all are glorified, even in the eyes of the"
4587,III.,"weakest, by death) begins to haunt him as Dante was haunted by the"
4588,III.,"thought of Beatrice alive. Yet, even at this very time, come doubts of"
4589,III.,the lawfulness of having thus adored (or thought he had adored) a mortal
4590,III.,woman; he does not know whether all this may not have been vanity and
4591,III.,folly; he tries to turn his thoughts away from Laura and up to God.
4592,III.,Perhaps he may be called on to account for having given too much of his
4593,III.,"life to a mere earthly love. Then, again, Laura reappears beautified in"
4594,III.,"his memory, and is again tremblingly half-conjured away. He is weak, and"
4595,III.,"sad, and helpless, and alone; and his heart is empty; he knows not what"
4596,III.,"to think nor how to feel; he sobs, and we cry with him. Nowhere could"
4597,III.,there be found a stranger contrast than this nostalgic craving after the
4598,III.,"dead Laura, vacillating and troubled by fear of sin and doubt of"
4599,III.,"unworthiness of object, with that solemn ending of the ""Vita Nuova,"""
4600,III.,where the name of Beatrice is pronounced for the last time before it be
4601,III.,"glorified in Paradise, where Dante devotes his life to becoming worthy"
4602,III.,"of saying ""such words as have never been said of any lady."" The ideal"
4603,III.,"woman is one and unchangeable in glory, and unchangeable is the passion"
4604,III.,"of her lover; but of this sweet dead Laura, whose purity and beauty and"
4605,III.,"cruelty he had sung, without a tremor of self-unworthiness all her"
4606,III.,"life, of her the poor weak Petrarch begins to doubt, of her and her"
4607,III.,worthiness of all this love; and when? when she is dead and himself is
4608,III.,dying.
4609,III.,
4610,III.,"Such a man is Petrarch; and yet, by the irresistible purifying and"
4611,III.,"elevating power of the ""Vita Nuova,'"" this man came to write not other"
4612,III.,"_albas_ and _serenas,_ not other love-songs to be added to the"
4613,III.,"love-songs of Provence, but those sonnets and canzoni which for four"
4614,III.,"centuries taught the world, too coarse as yet to receive Dante's passion"
4615,III.,"at first hand, a nobler and more spiritual love. After Petrarch a"
4616,III.,gradual change takes place in the poetic conception of love: except in
4617,III.,"learned revivalisms or in loose buffooneries, the mere fleshly love of"
4618,III.,"Antiquity disappears out of literature; and equally so, though by a"
4619,III.,"slower process of gradual transformation, vanishes also the adoring, but"
4620,III.,undisguisedly adulterous love of the troubadours and minnesingers. Into
4621,III.,"the love Instincts of mankind have been mingled, however much diluted,"
4622,III.,some drops of the more spiritual passion of Dante. The _puella_ of
4623,III.,"Antiquity, the noble dame of feudal days, is succeeded in Latin"
4624,III.,"countries, in Italy, and France, and Spain, and Portugal, by the"
4625,III.,"_gloriosa donna_ imitated from. Petrarch, and imitated by Petrarch from"
4626,III.,"Dante; a long-line of shadowy figures, veiled in the veil of Madonna"
4627,III.,"Laura, ladies beloved of Lorenzo and Michael Angelo, of Ariosto, and"
4628,III.,"Tasso, and Camoens, and Cervantes, passes through the world; nay, even"
4629,III.,"the sprightly-mistress of Ronsard, half-bred pagan and troubadour has"
4630,III.,airs of dignity and mystery which make us almost think that in this
4631,III.,"dainty coquettish French body, of Marie or Helene or Cassandrette, there"
4632,III.,really may be an immortal soul. But with the Renaissance--that movement
4633,III.,"half of mediæval democratic progress, and half of antique revivalism,"
4634,III.,"and to which in reality belongs not merely Petrarch, but Dante, and"
4635,III.,"every one of the Tuscan poets, Guinicelli, Lapo Gianni, Cavalcanti, who"
4636,III.,broke with the feudal poetry of Provence and Sicily--with the
4637,III.,"Renaissance, or rather with its long-drawn-out end, comes the close, for"
4638,III.,"the moment, of the really creative activity of the Latin peoples in the"
4639,III.,domain of poetry. All the things for two centuries which Italy and
4640,III.,France and Spain and Portugal (which we must remember for the sake of
4641,III.,"Camoens) continue to produce, are but developments of parts left"
4642,III.,"untouched; or refinements of extreme detail, as in the case,"
4643,III.,"particularly, of the French poets of the sixteenth century; but poetry"
4644,III.,"receives from these races nothing new or vital, no fresh ideal or"
4645,III.,"fruitful marriage of ideals. And here begins, uniting in itself all the"
4646,III.,"scattered and long-dormant powers of Northern poetry, the great and"
4647,III.,unexpected action of England. It had slept through the singing period of
4648,III.,"the Middle Ages, and was awakened, not by Germany or Provence, but by"
4649,III.,"Italy: Boccaccio and Petrarch spoke, and, as through dreams, England in"
4650,III.,"Chaucer's voice, made answer. Again, when the Renaissance had drawn to a"
4651,III.,"close, far on in the sixteenth century, English poetry was reawakened;"
4652,III.,"and again by Italy. This time it was completely wakened, and arose and"
4653,III.,slept no more. And one of the great and fruitful things achieved by
4654,III.,English poetry in this its final awakening was to give to the world the
4655,III.,"new, the modern, perhaps the definitive, the final ideal of love."
4656,III.,England drank a deep draught--how deep we see from Sidney's and
4657,III.,"Spenser's sonnets--of Petrarch; and in this pleasant dilution, tasted"
4658,III.,"and felt the burning essence of the ""Vita Nuova;"" for though Dante"
4659,III.,"remained as the poet, the poet of heaven and hell, this happy"
4660,III.,half-and-half Petrarch had for full two centuries completely driven into
4661,III.,"oblivion the young Dante who had loved Beatrice. For England, for this"
4662,III.,magnificent and marvellous outburst of all the manifold poetic energy
4663,III.,"stored up and quintupled during that long period of inertness, there"
4664,III.,could however be no foreign imported ideal of love; there was no
4665,III.,"possibility of a new series of spectral Lauras, shadows projected by a"
4666,III.,"shadow. Already, long ago, at the first call of Petrarch, Chaucer, by"
4667,III.,the side of the merely mediæval love types--of brutish lust and doglike
4668,III.,"devotion--of the Wife of Bath and of Griseldis, had rough-sketched a"
4669,III.,"kind of modern love, the love which is to become that of Romeo and"
4670,III.,"Hamlet, in his story of Palemon and Arcite. Among the poetic material"
4671,III.,which existed in England at the close of the sixteenth century was the
4672,III.,"old, long-neglected, domestic love, quiet, undemonstrative, essentially"
4673,III.,"unsinging, of the early Northern (as indeed also of the Greek and"
4674,III.,"Hindoo) epics; a domestic love which, in a social condition more closely"
4675,III.,"resembling our own than any other, even than that of the Italian"
4676,III.,"democracies, which had preceded it; among a people who permitted a woman"
4677,III.,"to choose her own husband, and forbade a man wooing another man's wife,"
4678,III.,"had already, in ballads and folk poetry, begun a faint-twitter of song."
4679,III.,"To this love of the man and the woman who hope to marry, strong and"
4680,III.,"tender, but still (as Coleridge remarked of several of the lesser"
4681,III.,"Elizabethan playwrights) most outspokenly carnal, was united by the pure"
4682,III.,"spirit of Spenser, by the unerring genius of Shakespeare, that vivifying"
4683,III.,"drop of burning, spiritual love taken from out of the ""Vita Nuova,"""
4684,III.,"which had floated, like some sovereign essential oil, on the top of"
4685,III.,Petrarch's rose-water. Henceforward the world possesses a new kind of
4686,III.,"love: the love of Romeo, of Hamlet, of Bassanio, of Viola, and of"
4687,III.,"Juliet; the love of the love poems of Shelley, of Tennyson, of Browning"
4688,III.,"and Browning's wife. A love whose blindness, exaggeration of passion,"
4689,III.,"all that might have made it foolish and impracticable, leads no longer"
4690,III.,"to folly and sin, but to an intenser activity of mankind's imagination"
4691,III.,"of the good and beautiful, to a momentary realization in our fancy of"
4692,III.,"all our vague dreams of perfection; a love which, though it may cool"
4693,III.,"down imperceptibly and pale in its intenseness, like the sunrise fires"
4694,III.,"into a serene sky, has left some glory round the head of the wife, some"
4695,III.,"glory in the heart of the husband, has been, however fleeting, a vision"
4696,III.,of beauty which has made beauty more real. And all this owing to the
4697,III.,"creation, the storing up, the purification by the Platonic poets of"
4698,III.,"Tuscany, of that strange and seemingly so artificial and unreal thing,"
4699,III.,"mediæval love; the very forms and themes of whose poetry, the _serena_"
4700,III.,"and the _alba_, which had been indignantly put aside by the early"
4701,III.,"Italian lyrists, being unconsciously revived, and purified and"
4702,III.,consecrated in the two loveliest love poems of Elizabethan poetry: the
4703,III.,"_serena_, the evening song of impatient expectation in Spenser's"
4704,III.,"Epithalamium; the _alba_, the dawn song of hurried parting, in the"
4705,III.,"balcony scene of ""Romeo and Juliet."""
4706,III.,
4707,III.,Let us recapitulate. The feudal Middle Ages gave to mankind a more
4708,III.,"refined and spiritual love, a love all chivalry, fidelity, and"
4709,III.,"adoration, but a love steeped in the poison of adultery; and to save the"
4710,III.,pure and noble portions of this mediæval love became the mission of the
4711,III.,Tuscan poets of that strange school of Platonic love which in its very
4712,III.,"loveliness may sometimes seem so unnatural and sterile. For, by reducing"
4713,III.,"this mediæval love to a mere intellectual passion, seeking in woman"
4714,III.,"merely a self-made embodiment of cravings after perfection, they"
4715,III.,cleansed away that deep stain of adultery; they quadrupled the intensity
4716,III.,of the ideal element; they distilled the very essential spirit of poetic
4717,III.,"passion, of which but a few drops, even as diluted by Petrarch,"
4718,III.,"precipitated, when mingled with the earthly passion of future poets, to"
4719,III.,"the bottom, no longer to be seen or tasted, all baser ingredients."
4720,III.,
4721,III.,"And, while the poems of minnesingers and troubadours have ceased to"
4722,III.,"appeal to us, and remain merely for their charm of verse and of graceful"
4723,III.,conceit; the poetry written by the Italians of the thirteenth century
4724,III.,"for women, whose love was but an imaginative fervour, remains"
4725,III.,"concentrated in the ""Vita Nuova;"" and will remain for all time the"
4726,III.,sovereign purifier to which the world must have recourse whenever that
4727,III.,"precipitate of baser instincts, which thickened like slime the love"
4728,III.,"poetry of Antiquity, shall rise again and sully the purity of the love"
4729,III.,poetry of to-day.

4735,EPILOGUE.,EPILOGUE.
4736,EPILOGUE.,
4737,EPILOGUE.,"More than a year has elapsed since the moment when, fancying that this"
4738,EPILOGUE.,"series of studies must be well-nigh complete, I attempted to explain in"
4739,EPILOGUE.,"an introductory chapter what the nature of this book of mine is, or"
4740,EPILOGUE.,would fain be. I had hoped that each of these studies would complete its
4741,EPILOGUE.,"companions; and that, without need for explicit explanation, my whole"
4742,EPILOGUE.,idea would have become more plain to others than it was at that time
4743,EPILOGUE.,"even to myself. But instead, it has become obvious that the more"
4744,EPILOGUE.,"carefully I had sought to reduce each question to unity, the more that"
4745,EPILOGUE.,"question-subdivided and connected itself with other questions; and that,"
4746,EPILOGUE.,"with the solution of each separate problem, had arisen a new set of"
4747,EPILOGUE.,problems which infinitely complicated the main lessons to be deduced
4748,EPILOGUE.,"from a study of that many-sided civilization to which, remembering the"
4749,EPILOGUE.,"brilliant and mysterious offspring of Faustus and Helena, I have given"
4750,EPILOGUE.,"the name of Euphorion. Hence, as it seems, the necessity for a few"
4751,EPILOGUE.,further words of explanation.
4752,EPILOGUE.,
4753,EPILOGUE.,"In those introductory pages written some fifteen months ago, I tried to"
4754,EPILOGUE.,bring home to the reader a sense which has haunted me throughout the
4755,EPILOGUE.,"writing of this volume; namely, that instead of having deliberately made"
4756,EPILOGUE.,"up my mind to study the Renaissance, as one makes up one's mind to visit"
4757,EPILOGUE.,"Greece or Egypt or the Holy Land; I have, on the contrary, quite"
4758,EPILOGUE.,"accidentally and unconsciously, found myself wandering about in spirit"
4759,EPILOGUE.,"among the monuments of this particular historic region, even as I might"
4760,EPILOGUE.,"wander about in the streets of Siena where I wrote last year, of"
4761,EPILOGUE.,"Florence whence I write at present; wandering about among these things,"
4762,EPILOGUE.,"and little by little feeling a particular interest in one, then in"
4763,EPILOGUE.,"another, according as each happened to catch my fancy or to recall some"
4764,EPILOGUE.,"already known thing. Now these, which for want of a better word I have"
4765,EPILOGUE.,"just called monuments, and just now, less clearly, but also less"
4766,EPILOGUE.,"foolishly, merely _things_--these things were in reality not merely"
4767,EPILOGUE.,"individual and really existing buildings, books, pictures, or statues,"
4768,EPILOGUE.,"individual and really registered men, women, and events; they were the"
4769,EPILOGUE.,mental conceptions which I had extracted out of these realities; the
4770,EPILOGUE.,intellectual types made up (as the mediæval symbols of justice are made
4771,EPILOGUE.,"up of the visible paraphernalia, robe, scales and sword, for judging and"
4772,EPILOGUE.,weighing and punishing) of the impressions left on the mind by all
4773,EPILOGUE.,"those buildings, or books, or pictures, or statues, or men, women, and"
4774,EPILOGUE.,events. They were not the iniquities of this particular despot nor the
4775,EPILOGUE.,"scandalous sayings of that particular humanist, but the general moral"
4776,EPILOGUE.,chaos of the Italian fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; not the poem of
4777,EPILOGUE.,"Pulci, of Boiardo, of Ariosto in especial, but a vast imaginary poem"
4778,EPILOGUE.,made up of them all; not the mediæval saints of Angelico and the pagan
4779,EPILOGUE.,"demi-gods of Michael Angelo, but the two tremendous abstractions: the"
4780,EPILOGUE.,"spirit of Mediævalism in art, and the spirit of Antiquity; the interest"
4781,EPILOGUE.,"in the distressed soul, and the interest in the flourishing body. And,"
4782,EPILOGUE.,"as my thoughts have gone back to Antiquity and onwards to our own times,"
4783,EPILOGUE.,their starting-point has nevertheless been the Tuscan art of the
4784,EPILOGUE.,"fifteenth century, their nucleus some notes on busts by Benedetto da"
4785,EPILOGUE.,Maiano and portraits by Raphael.
4786,EPILOGUE.,
4787,EPILOGUE.,My _dramatis persona_ have been modes of feeling and forms of art. I
4788,EPILOGUE.,"have tried to explain the life and character, not of any man or woman,"
4789,EPILOGUE.,"but of the moral scepticism of Italy, of the tragic spirit of our"
4790,EPILOGUE.,Elizabethan dramatists; I have tried to write the biography of the
4791,EPILOGUE.,"romance poetry of the Middle Ages, of the realism of the great portrait"
4792,EPILOGUE.,"painters and sculptors of the Renaissance. But these, my _dramatis"
4793,EPILOGUE.,"persona,_ are, let me repeat it, abstractions: they exist only in my"
4794,EPILOGUE.,"mind and in the minds of those who think like myself. Hence, like all"
4795,EPILOGUE.,"abstractions, they represent the essence of a question, but not its"
4796,EPILOGUE.,"completeness, its many-sidedness as we may see it in reality. Hence it"
4797,EPILOGUE.,is that I have frequently passed over exceptions to the rule which I was
4798,EPILOGUE.,"stating, because the explanation of these exceptions would have involved"
4799,EPILOGUE.,the formulating of a number of apparently irrelevant propositions; so
4800,EPILOGUE.,"that any one who please may accuse me of inexactness; and, to give an"
4801,EPILOGUE.,"instance, cover the margins of my essay on Mediæval Love with a whole"
4802,EPILOGUE.,list of virtuous love stories of the Middle Ages; or else ferret out of
4803,EPILOGUE.,Raynouard and Von der Hagen a dozen pages of mediæval poems in praise of
4804,EPILOGUE.,"rustic life. These objections will be perfectly correct, and (so far as"
4805,EPILOGUE.,my knowledge permitted me) I might have puzzled the reader with them
4806,EPILOGUE.,"myself; but it remains none the less certain that, in the main, mediæval"
4807,EPILOGUE.,"love was not virtuous, and mediæval peasantry not admired by poets; and"
4808,EPILOGUE.,"none the less certain, I think, also, that in describing the"
4809,EPILOGUE.,"characteristics and origin of an abstract thing, such as mediæval love,"
4810,EPILOGUE.,"or mediæval feeling towards the country and country folk, it was my"
4811,EPILOGUE.,business to state the rule and let alone the exceptions.
4812,EPILOGUE.,
4813,EPILOGUE.,There is another matter which gives me far greater concern. In creating
4814,EPILOGUE.,"and dealing with an abstraction, one is frequently forced, if I may use"
4815,EPILOGUE.,"the expression, to cut a subject in two, to bring one of its sides into"
4816,EPILOGUE.,"full light and leave the other in darkness; nay, to speak harshly of one"
4817,EPILOGUE.,side of an art or of a man without being able to speak admiringly of
4818,EPILOGUE.,another side.
4819,EPILOGUE.,
4820,EPILOGUE.,"This one-sidedness, this apparent injustice of judgment, has in some"
4821,EPILOGUE.,cases been remedied by the fact that I have treated in one study those
4822,EPILOGUE.,"things which I was forced to omit in another study; as, in two separate"
4823,EPILOGUE.,"essays, I have pointed out first the extreme inferiority of Renaissance"
4824,EPILOGUE.,sculpture to the sculpture of Antiquity with regard to absolute beauty
4825,EPILOGUE.,of form; and then the immeasurable superiority of Renaissance over
4826,EPILOGUE.,antique sculpture in the matter of that beauty and interest dependent
4827,EPILOGUE.,"upon mere arrangement and handling, wherein lies the beauty-creating"
4828,EPILOGUE.,"power of realistic schools. But most often I have shown one side, not"
4829,EPILOGUE.,"merely of an artist or an art, but of my own feeling, without showing"
4830,EPILOGUE.,the other; and in one case this inevitable one-sidedness has weighed
4831,EPILOGUE.,"upon me almost like personal guilt, and has almost made me postpone the"
4832,EPILOGUE.,"publication of this book to the Greek Kalends, in hopes of being able to"
4833,EPILOGUE.,explain and to atone. I am alluding to Fra Angelico. I spoke of him in a
4834,EPILOGUE.,"study of the progress of mere beautiful form, the naked human form"
4835,EPILOGUE.,"moreover, in the art of the Renaissance; I looked at his work with my"
4836,EPILOGUE.,mind full of the unapproachable superiority of antique form; I judged
4837,EPILOGUE.,and condemned the artist with reference to that superb movement towards
4838,EPILOGUE.,nature and form and bodily beauty which was the universal movement of
4839,EPILOGUE.,the fifteenth century; I lost patience with this saint because he would
4840,EPILOGUE.,"not turn pagan; I pushed aside, because he did not seek for a classic"
4841,EPILOGUE.,"Olympus, his exquisite dreams of a mediæval Paradise. I had taken part,"
4842,EPILOGUE.,"as its chronicler, with the art which seeks mere plastic perfection, the"
4843,EPILOGUE.,"art to which Angelico said, ""Retro me Sathana."" It was my intention to"
4844,EPILOGUE.,close even this volume with a study of the poetical conception of early
4845,EPILOGUE.,"Renaissance painting, of that strange kind of painting in which a thing"
4846,EPILOGUE.,"but imperfect in itself, a mere symbol of lovely ideas, brings home to"
4847,EPILOGUE.,"our mind, with a rush of associations, a sense of beauty and wonder"
4848,EPILOGUE.,greater perhaps than any which we receive from the sober reality of
4849,EPILOGUE.,"perfect form. Again, there are the German masters--the great engravers,"
4850,EPILOGUE.,"Kranach, Altdorfer, Aldegrever, especially; of whom, for their absolute"
4851,EPILOGUE.,"pleasure in ugly women, for their filthy delight in horrors, I have said"
4852,EPILOGUE.,"an immense amount of ill; and of whom, for their wonderful intuition of"
4853,EPILOGUE.,"dramatic situation, their instinct of the poetry of common things, and"
4854,EPILOGUE.,"their magnificently imaginative rendering of landscape, I hope some day"
4855,EPILOGUE.,to say an equal amount of good.
4856,EPILOGUE.,
4857,EPILOGUE.,I have spoken of the lesson which may be derived from studies even as
4858,EPILOGUE.,"humble as these studies of mine; since, in my opinion, we cannot treat"
4859,EPILOGUE.,history as a mere art--though history alone can gives us now-a-days
4860,EPILOGUE.,"tragedy which has ceased to exist on our stage, and wonder which has"
4861,EPILOGUE.,ceased to exist in our poetry--we cannot seek in it mere selfish
4862,EPILOGUE.,"enjoyment of imagination and emotion, without doing our soul the great"
4863,EPILOGUE.,"injury of cheating it of some of those great indignations, some of"
4864,EPILOGUE.,those great lessons which make it stronger and more supple in the
4865,EPILOGUE.,practical affairs of life. Each of these studies of mine brings its own
4866,EPILOGUE.,"lesson, artistic or ethical, important or unimportant; its lesson of"
4867,EPILOGUE.,"seeking certainty in our moral opinions, beauty in all and whatever our"
4868,EPILOGUE.,"forms of art, spirituality in our love. But besides these I seem to"
4869,EPILOGUE.,"perceive another deduction, an historical fact with a practical"
4870,EPILOGUE.,application; to see it as the result not merely perhaps of the studies
4871,EPILOGUE.,"of which this book is the fruit, but of those further studies, of the"
4872,EPILOGUE.,subtler sides of Mediæval and Renaissance life and art which at present
4873,EPILOGUE.,occupy my mind and may some day add another series of essays to this: a
4874,EPILOGUE.,"lesson still vague to myself, but which, satisfactorily or"
4875,EPILOGUE.,"unsatisfactorily, I shall nevertheless attempt to explain; if indeed it"
4876,EPILOGUE.,requires to be brought home to the reader.
4877,EPILOGUE.,
4878,EPILOGUE.,Of the few forms of feeling and imagination which I have treated--things
4879,EPILOGUE.,so different from one another as the feeling for nature and the
4880,EPILOGUE.,"chivalric poem, as modern art, with its idealism and realism, and modern"
4881,EPILOGUE.,"love--of these forms, emotional and artistic, which Antiquity did not"
4882,EPILOGUE.,"know, or knew but little, the reader may have observed that I have"
4883,EPILOGUE.,almost invariably traced the origin deep into that fruitful cosmopolitan
4884,EPILOGUE.,"chaos, due to the mingling of all that was still unused of the remains"
4885,EPILOGUE.,of Antiquity with all that was untouched of the intellectual and moral
4886,EPILOGUE.,"riches of the barbarous nations, to which we give the name of Middle"
4887,EPILOGUE.,"Ages; and that I have, as invariably, followed the development of these"
4888,EPILOGUE.,"precious forms, and their definitive efflorescence and fruit-bearing,"
4889,EPILOGUE.,into that particular country where certain mediæval conditions had
4890,EPILOGUE.,"ceased to exist, namely Italy. In other words, it has seemed to me that"
4891,EPILOGUE.,the things which I have studied were originally produced during the
4892,EPILOGUE.,"Middle Ages, and consequently in the mediæval countries, France,"
4893,EPILOGUE.,"Germany, Provence; but did not attain maturity except in that portion of"
4894,EPILOGUE.,"the Middle Ages which is mediæval no longer, but already more than half"
4895,EPILOGUE.,"modern, the Renaissance, which began in Italy not with the establishment"
4896,EPILOGUE.,"of despotisms and the coming of Greek humanists, but with the"
4897,EPILOGUE.,independence of the free towns and with the revival of Roman tradition.
4898,EPILOGUE.,
4899,EPILOGUE.,"Why so? Because, it appears to me, after watching the lines of my"
4900,EPILOGUE.,"thought converging to this point, because, with a few exceptions, the"
4901,EPILOGUE.,Middle Ages were rich in great beginnings (indeed a good half of all
4902,EPILOGUE.,that makes up our present civilization seems to issue from them): but
4903,EPILOGUE.,they were poor in complete achievements; full of the seeds of modern
4904,EPILOGUE.,"institutions, arts, thoughts, and feelings, they yet show us but rarely"
4905,EPILOGUE.,"the complete growth of any one of them: a fruitful Nile flood, but which"
4906,EPILOGUE.,"must cease to drown and to wash away, which must subside before the"
4907,EPILOGUE.,germs that it has brought can shoot forth and mature. The sense of this
4908,EPILOGUE.,comes home to me most powerfully whenever I think of mediæval poetry and
4909,EPILOGUE.,mediæval painting.
4910,EPILOGUE.,
4911,EPILOGUE.,"The songs of the troubadours and minnesingers, what are they to our"
4912,EPILOGUE.,"feelings? They are pleasant, even occasionally beautiful, but they are"
4913,EPILOGUE.,"empty, lamentably empty, charming arrangements of words; poetry which"
4914,EPILOGUE.,fills our mind or touches our heart comes only with the Tuscan lyrists
4915,EPILOGUE.,of the thirteenth century. The same applies to mediæval narrative-verse:
4916,EPILOGUE.,"it is, with one or two exceptions or half exceptions, such as ""The"
4917,EPILOGUE.,"Chanson de Roland"" and Gottfried's ""Tristan und Isolde,"" decidedly"
4918,EPILOGUE.,"wearisome; a thing to study, but scarcely a thing to delight in. I do"
4919,EPILOGUE.,"not mean to say that the old legends of Wales and Scandinavia,"
4920,EPILOGUE.,"subsequently embodied by the French and German poets of the Middle Ages,"
4921,EPILOGUE.,are without imaginative or emotional interest; nothing can be further
4922,EPILOGUE.,"from my thoughts. The Nibelung story possesses, both in the Norse and in"
4923,EPILOGUE.,"the Middle High German version, a tragic fascination; and a quaint"
4924,EPILOGUE.,"fairy-tale interest, every now and then rising to the charm of a"
4925,EPILOGUE.,"Decameronian _novella_, is possessed by many of the Keltic tales,"
4926,EPILOGUE.,whether briefly told in the Mabinogion or lengthily detailed by
4927,EPILOGUE.,Chrestien de Troyes and Wolfram von Eschenbach. But all this is the
4928,EPILOGUE.,"interest of the mere story, and you would enjoy it almost as much if"
4929,EPILOGUE.,that story were related not by a poet but by a peasant; it is the
4930,EPILOGUE.,"fascination of the mere theme, with the added fascination of our own"
4931,EPILOGUE.,"unconscious filling up and colouring of details. And the poem itself,"
4932,EPILOGUE.,"whence we extract this theme, remains, for the most part, uninteresting."
4933,EPILOGUE.,"The figures are vague, almost shapeless and colourless; they have no"
4934,EPILOGUE.,"well-understood mental and moral anatomy, so that when they speak and"
4935,EPILOGUE.,act the writer seems to have no clear conception of the motives or
4936,EPILOGUE.,"tempers which make them do so; even as in a child's pictures, the horses"
4937,EPILOGUE.,"gallop, the men run, the houses stand, but without any indication of the"
4938,EPILOGUE.,"muscles which move the horse, of the muscles which hold up the man, of"
4939,EPILOGUE.,"the solid ground upon which is built, nay rather, into which is planted,"
4940,EPILOGUE.,"the house. Hatred of Hagen, devotion of Rüdger, passionate piety of"
4941,EPILOGUE.,Parzival--all these are things of which we do not particularly see the
4942,EPILOGUE.,"how or why; we do not follow the reasons, in event or character, which"
4943,EPILOGUE.,"make these men sacrifice themselves or others, weep, storm, and so"
4944,EPILOGUE.,"forth; nay, even when these reasons are clear from the circumstances, we"
4945,EPILOGUE.,"are not shown the action of the mechanism, we do not see how Brunhilt is"
4946,EPILOGUE.,"wroth, how Chriemhilt is revengeful, how Herzeloid is devoted to"
4947,EPILOGUE.,"Parzival. There is, in the vast majority of this mediæval poetry, no"
4948,EPILOGUE.,clear conception of the construction and functions of people's
4949,EPILOGUE.,"character, and hence no conception either of those actions and reactions"
4950,EPILOGUE.,"of various moral organs which, after all, are at the bottom of the"
4951,EPILOGUE.,events related. Herein lies the difference between the forms of the
4952,EPILOGUE.,"Middle Ages and those of Antiquity; for how perfectly felt, understood,"
4953,EPILOGUE.,"is not every feeling and every action of the Homeric heroes, how"
4954,EPILOGUE.,perfectly indicated! We can see the manner and reason of the conflict of
4955,EPILOGUE.,"Achilles and Agamemnon, of the behaviour of the returned Odysseus, as"
4956,EPILOGUE.,clearly as we see the manner and reason of the movements of the fighting
4957,EPILOGUE.,"Centaurs and Lapithæ, or the Amazons; nay, even the minute mood of"
4958,EPILOGUE.,"comparatively unimportant figures, as Helen, Brisei's, and Nausicaa, is"
4959,EPILOGUE.,indicated in its moral anatomy and attitude as distinctly as is the
4960,EPILOGUE.,manner in which the maidens of the Parthenon frieze slowly restrain
4961,EPILOGUE.,"their steps, the boys curb their steeds, or the old men balance their"
4962,EPILOGUE.,"oil jars. Nothing of this in mediæval literature, except perhaps in"
4963,EPILOGUE.,"""Flamenca"" and ""Tristan,"" where the motive of action, mere imaginative"
4964,EPILOGUE.,"desire, is all-permeating and explains everything. These people clearly"
4965,EPILOGUE.,"had no interest, no perception, connected with character: a valorous"
4966,EPILOGUE.,"woman, a chivalrous knight, an insolent steward, a jealous husband, a"
4967,EPILOGUE.,"faithful retainer; things recognized only in outline, made to speak and"
4968,EPILOGUE.,"act only according to a fixed tradition, without knowledge of the"
4969,EPILOGUE.,internal mechanism of motive; these sufficed. Hence it is that mediæval
4970,EPILOGUE.,poetry is always like mediæval painting (for painting continued to be
4971,EPILOGUE.,mediæval with Giotto's pupils long after poetry had ceased to be
4972,EPILOGUE.,"mediæval with Dante and his school), where the Virgin sits and holds the"
4973,EPILOGUE.,child without body wherewith to sit or arms wherewith to hold; where
4974,EPILOGUE.,"angels flutter forward and kneel in conventional greeting, with"
4975,EPILOGUE.,"obviously no bended knees beneath their robes, nay, with knees, waist,"
4976,EPILOGUE.,"armpits, all anywhere; where men ride upon horses without flat to their"
4977,EPILOGUE.,"back; where processions of the blessed come forth, guided by fiddling"
4978,EPILOGUE.,"seraphs, vague, faint faces, sweet or grand, heads which might wave like"
4979,EPILOGUE.,"pieces of cut-out paper upon their necks, arms and legs here and there,"
4980,EPILOGUE.,"not clearly belonging to any one; creatures marching, soaring, flying,"
4981,EPILOGUE.,"singing, fiddling, without a bone or a muscle wherewith to do it all."
4982,EPILOGUE.,"And meanwhile, in this mediæval poetry, as in this mediæval painting,"
4983,EPILOGUE.,there are yards and yards of elaborate preciousness: all the embossed
4984,EPILOGUE.,"velvets, all the white-and-gold-shot brocades, all the silks and satins,"
4985,EPILOGUE.,and jewel-embroidered stuffs of the universe cast stiffly about these
4986,EPILOGUE.,"phantom men and women, these phantom horses and horsemen. It is not"
4987,EPILOGUE.,"until we turn to Italy, and to the Northern man, Chaucer, entirely under"
4988,EPILOGUE.,"Italian influence, that we obtain an approach to the antique clearness"
4989,EPILOGUE.,of perception and comprehension; that we obtain not only in Dante
4990,EPILOGUE.,something akin to the muscularities of Signorelli and Michael Angelo;
4991,EPILOGUE.,"but in Boccaccio and Chaucer, in Cavalca and Petrarch, the equivalent of"
4992,EPILOGUE.,"the well-understood movement, the well-indicated situation of the"
4993,EPILOGUE.,"simple, realistic or poetic, sketches of Filippino and Botticelli."
4994,EPILOGUE.,
4995,EPILOGUE.,"This, you will say, is a mere impression; it is no explanation, still"
4996,EPILOGUE.,less such an explanation as may afford a lesson. Not so. This strange
4997,EPILOGUE.,"inconclusiveness in all mediæval things, till the moment comes when they"
4998,EPILOGUE.,cease to be mediæval; this richness in germs and poverty in mature
4999,EPILOGUE.,"fruit, cannot be without its reason. And this reason, to my mind, lies"
5000,EPILOGUE.,"in one word, the most terrible word of any, since it means suffering and"
5001,EPILOGUE.,hopelessness; a word which has haunted my mind ever since I have looked
5002,EPILOGUE.,into mediæval things: the word Wastefulness. Wastefulness; the frightful
5003,EPILOGUE.,"characteristic of times at once so rich and so poor, the explanation of"
5004,EPILOGUE.,"the long starvation and sickness that mankind, that all mankind's"
5005,EPILOGUE.,"concerns--art, poetry, science, life--endured while the very things"
5006,EPILOGUE.,"which would have fed and revived and nurtured, existed close at hand,"
5007,EPILOGUE.,"and in profusion. Wastefulness, in this great period of confusion, of"
5008,EPILOGUE.,"the most precious things that we possess: time, thought, and feeling"
5009,EPILOGUE.,"refused to the realities of the world, and lavished on the figments of"
5010,EPILOGUE.,"the imagination. Why this vagueness, this imperfection in all mediæval"
5011,EPILOGUE.,"representations of life? Because even as men's eyes were withdrawn, by"
5012,EPILOGUE.,"the temporal institutions of those days, from the sight of the fields"
5013,EPILOGUE.,and meadows which were left to the blind and dumb thing called serf; so
5014,EPILOGUE.,"also the thoughts of mankind, its sympathy and intentions, were"
5015,EPILOGUE.,"withdrawn from the mere earthly souls, the mere earthly wrongs and woes"
5016,EPILOGUE.,of men by the great self-organized institution of mediæval religion.
5017,EPILOGUE.,Pity of the body of Christ held in bondage by the Infidel; love of God;
5018,EPILOGUE.,study of the unknowable things of Heaven: such are the noblest
5019,EPILOGUE.,"employments of the mediæval soul; how much of pity, of love, may remain"
5020,EPILOGUE.,for man; how much of study for the knowable? To Wastefulness like
5021,EPILOGUE.,"this--to misapplication of mind ending almost in palsy--must we ascribe,"
5022,EPILOGUE.,"I think, the strange sterility of such mediæval art as deals not merely"
5023,EPILOGUE.,"with pattern, but with the reality of man's body and soul. And we might"
5024,EPILOGUE.,"be thankful, if, during our wanderings among mediæval things, we had"
5025,EPILOGUE.,seen the starving of only art and artistic instincts; but the soul of
5026,EPILOGUE.,man has lain starving also; starving for the knowledge which was sought
5027,EPILOGUE.,"only of Divine things, starving for the love which was given only to"
5028,EPILOGUE.,God.
5029,EPILOGUE.,
5030,EPILOGUE.,"The explanation, therefore, and its lesson, may thus be summed up in the"
5031,EPILOGUE.,"one word Wastefulness. And the fruitfulness of the Renaissance, all that"
5032,EPILOGUE.,"it has given to us of art, of thought, of feeling (for the ""Vita Nuova"""
5033,EPILOGUE.,"is its fruit), is due, as it seems to me, to the fact that the"
5034,EPILOGUE.,"Renaissance is simply the condition of civilization when, thanks to the"
5035,EPILOGUE.,civil liberty and the spiritual liberty inherited from Rome and
5036,EPILOGUE.,"inherited from Greece, man's energies of thought and feeling were"
5037,EPILOGUE.,"withdrawn from the unknowable to the knowable, from Heaven to Earth; and"
5038,EPILOGUE.,were devoted to the developing of those marvellous new things which
5039,EPILOGUE.,"Antiquity had not known, and which had lain neglected and wasted during"
5040,EPILOGUE.,the Middle Ages.

5052,APPENDIX.,"here my original research, if such it may be called, comes to an end. I"
5053,APPENDIX.,have trusted only to myself for my impressions; but I have taken from
5054,APPENDIX.,"others everything that may be called historical fact, as distinguished"
5055,APPENDIX.,from the history of this or that form of thought or of art which I have
5056,APPENDIX.,tried to elaborate. My references are therefore only to standard
5057,APPENDIX.,"historical works, and to such editions of poets and prose writers as"
5058,APPENDIX.,have come into my hands. How much I am endebted to the genius of
5059,APPENDIX.,"Michelet; nay, rather, how much I am, however unimportant, the thing"
5060,APPENDIX.,"made by him, every one will see and judge. With regard to positive"
5061,APPENDIX.,information I must express my great obligations to the works of Jacob
5062,APPENDIX.,"Burckhardt, of Prof. Villari, and of Mr. J.A. Symonds in everything that"
5063,APPENDIX.,concerns the political history and social condition of the Renaissance.
5064,APPENDIX.,"Mr. Symonds' name I have placed last, although this is by no means the"
5065,APPENDIX.,"order of importance in which the three writers appear in my mind,"
5066,APPENDIX.,because vanity compels me to state that I have deprived myself of the
5067,APPENDIX.,"pleasure and profit of reading his volumes on Italian literature, from a"
5068,APPENDIX.,fear that finding myself doubtless forestalled by him in various
5069,APPENDIX.,"appreciations, I might deprive my essays of what I feel to be their"
5070,APPENDIX.,"principal merit, namely, the spontaneity and wholeness of personal"
5071,APPENDIX.,"impression. With regard to philological lore, I may refer, among a"
5072,APPENDIX.,"number of other works, to M. Gaston Paris' work on the Cycle of"
5073,APPENDIX.,"Charlemagne, M. de la Villemarqué's companion volume on Keltic romances,"
5074,APPENDIX.,"and Professor Rajna's ""Fonti dell' Ariosto."" My knowledge of"
5075,APPENDIX.,"troubadours, trouvères, and minnesingers is obtained mainly from the"
5076,APPENDIX.,"great collections of Raynouard, Wackernagel, Mätzner, Bartsch, and Von"
5077,APPENDIX.,"der Hagen, and from Bartsch's and Simrock's editions and versions of"
5078,APPENDIX.,"Gottfried von Strassburg, Hartmann von Aue, and Wolfram von Eschenbach."
5079,APPENDIX.,"""Flamenca"" I have read in Professor Paul Meyer's beautiful edition, text"
5080,APPENDIX.,"and translation; ""Aucassin et Nicolette,"" in an edition published, if I"
5081,APPENDIX.,"remember rightly, by Janet; and also in a very happy translation"
5082,APPENDIX.,"contained in Delvau's huge collection of ""Romans de Chevalerie,"" which"
5083,APPENDIX.,"contains, unfortunately sometimes garbled, as many of the prose stories"
5084,APPENDIX.,"of the Carolingian and Amadis cycle as I, at all events, could endure to"
5085,APPENDIX.,"read. For the early Italian poets, excepting Carducci's ""Cino da"
5086,APPENDIX.,"Pistoia,"" my references are the same as those in Rossetti's ""Dante and"
5087,APPENDIX.,"his Cycle,"" especially the ""Rime Antiche"" and the ""Poeti del Primo"
5088,APPENDIX.,"Secolo."" Professor d'Ancona's pleasant volume has greatly helped me in"
5089,APPENDIX.,the history of the transformation of the courtly poetry of the early
5090,APPENDIX.,"Middle Ages into the folk poetry of Tuscany. I owe a good deal also,"
5091,APPENDIX.,"with regard to this same essay ""The Outdoor Poetry,"" to Roskoff's famous"
5092,APPENDIX.,"""Geschichte des Teufels,"" and to Signor Novati's recently published"
5093,APPENDIX.,"""Carmina Medii _Ævi_."" The Italian _novellieri,_ Bandello, Cinthio, and"
5094,APPENDIX.,"their set, I have used in the Florentine editions of 1820 or 1825;"
5095,APPENDIX.,Masuccio edited by De Sanctis. For the essay on the Italian Renaissance
5096,APPENDIX.,"on the Elizabethan Stage, I have had recourse, chiefly, to the fifteenth"
5097,APPENDIX.,"century chronicles in the ""Archivio Storico Italiano,"" and to Dyce's"
5098,APPENDIX.,"Webster, Hartley Coleridge's Massinger and Ford, Churton Collins' Cyril"

5100,APPENDIX.,
5101,APPENDIX.,The essays on art have naturally profited by the now inevitable Crowe

5104,APPENDIX.,information to be obtained from any writers in the suggestions and
5105,APPENDIX.,"explanations of my friend Mr. T. Nelson MacLean, who has made it"
5106,APPENDIX.,possible for a mere creature of pens and ink to follow the differences
5107,APPENDIX.,of _technique_ of the sculptors and medallists of the fifteenth century;
5108,APPENDIX.,"a word of thanks also, for various such suggestions as can come only"
5109,APPENDIX.,"from a painter, to my old friend Mr. John S. Sargent, of Paris."
