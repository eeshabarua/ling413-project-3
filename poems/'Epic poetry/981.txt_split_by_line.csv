25,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,
26,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,
27,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,
28,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"LO, praise of the prowess of people-kings"
29,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"of spear-armed Danes, in days long sped,"
30,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"we have heard, and what honor the athelings won!"
31,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"Oft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes,"
32,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"from many a tribe, the mead-bench tore,"
33,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,awing the earls. Since erst he lay
34,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"friendless, a foundling, fate repaid him:"
35,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"for he waxed under welkin, in wealth he throve,"
36,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"till before him the folk, both far and near,"
37,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"who house by the whale-path, heard his mandate,"
38,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,gave him gifts:  a good king he!
39,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"To him an heir was afterward born,"
40,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"a son in his halls, whom heaven sent"
41,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"to favor the folk, feeling their woe"
42,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,that erst they had lacked an earl for leader
43,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"so long a while; the Lord endowed him,"
44,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"the Wielder of Wonder, with world's renown."
45,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"Famed was this Beowulf:  {0a} far flew the boast of him,"
46,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"son of Scyld, in the Scandian lands."
47,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,So becomes it a youth to quit him well
48,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"with his father's friends, by fee and gift,"
49,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"that to aid him, aged, in after days,"
50,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"come warriors willing, should war draw nigh,"
51,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,liegemen loyal:  by lauded deeds
52,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,shall an earl have honor in every clan.
53,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,
54,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"Forth he fared at the fated moment,"
55,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,sturdy Scyld to the shelter of God.
56,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"Then they bore him over to ocean's billow,"
57,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"loving clansmen, as late he charged them,"
58,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"while wielded words the winsome Scyld,"
59,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,the leader beloved who long had ruled....
60,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"In the roadstead rocked a ring-dight vessel,"
61,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"ice-flecked, outbound, atheling's barge:"
62,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,there laid they down their darling lord
63,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"on the breast of the boat, the breaker-of-rings, {0b}"
64,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,by the mast the mighty one. Many a treasure
65,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,fetched from far was freighted with him.
66,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,No ship have I known so nobly dight
67,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"with weapons of war and weeds of battle,"
68,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,with breastplate and blade:  on his bosom lay
69,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,a heaped hoard that hence should go
70,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,far o'er the flood with him floating away.
71,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"No less these loaded the lordly gifts,"
72,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"thanes' huge treasure, than those had done"
73,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,who in former time forth had sent him
74,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"sole on the seas, a suckling child."
75,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"High o'er his head they hoist the standard,"
76,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"a gold-wove banner; let billows take him,"
77,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"gave him to ocean. Grave were their spirits,"
78,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,mournful their mood. No man is able
79,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"to say in sooth, no son of the halls,"
80,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,"no hero 'neath heaven, -- who harbored that freight!"
81,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,
82,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,
83,PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE,

85,I,
86,I,"Now Beowulf bode in the burg of the Scyldings,"
87,I,"leader beloved, and long he ruled"
88,I,"in fame with all folk, since his father had gone"
89,I,"away from the world, till awoke an heir,"
90,I,"haughty Healfdene, who held through life,"
91,I,"sage and sturdy, the Scyldings glad."
92,I,"Then, one after one, there woke to him,"
93,I,"to the chieftain of clansmen, children four:"
94,I,"Heorogar, then Hrothgar, then Halga brave;"
95,I,"and I heard that -- was -- 's queen,"
96,I,the Heathoscylfing's helpmate dear.
97,I,"To Hrothgar was given such glory of war,"
98,I,"such honor of combat, that all his kin"
99,I,obeyed him gladly till great grew his band
100,I,of youthful comrades. It came in his mind
101,I,"to bid his henchmen a hall uprear,"
102,I,"a master mead-house, mightier far"
103,I,"than ever was seen by the sons of earth,"
104,I,"and within it, then, to old and young"
105,I,"he would all allot that the Lord had sent him,"
106,I,save only the land and the lives of his men.
107,I,"Wide, I heard, was the work commanded,"
108,I,"for many a tribe this mid-earth round,"
109,I,"to fashion the folkstead. It fell, as he ordered,"
110,I,"in rapid achievement that ready it stood there,"
111,I,of halls the noblest:  Heorot {1a} he named it
112,I,whose message had might in many a land.
113,I,"Not reckless of promise, the rings he dealt,"
114,I,"treasure at banquet:  there towered the hall,"
115,I,"high, gabled wide, the hot surge waiting"
116,I,of furious flame. {1b} Nor far was that day
117,I,when father and son-in-law stood in feud
118,I,for warfare and hatred that woke again. {1c}
119,I,With envy and anger an evil spirit
120,I,"endured the dole in his dark abode,"
121,I,that he heard each day the din of revel
122,I,"high in the hall:  there harps rang out,"
123,I,clear song of the singer. He sang who knew {1d}
124,I,"tales of the early time of man,"
125,I,"how the Almighty made the earth,"
126,I,"fairest fields enfolded by water,"
127,I,"set, triumphant, sun and moon"
128,I,"for a light to lighten the land-dwellers,"
129,I,and braided bright the breast of earth
130,I,"with limbs and leaves, made life for all"
131,I,of mortal beings that breathe and move.
132,I,So lived the clansmen in cheer and revel
133,I,"a winsome life, till one began"
134,I,"to fashion evils, that field of hell."
135,I,"Grendel this monster grim was called,"
136,I,"march-riever {1e} mighty, in moorland living,"
137,I,in fen and fastness; fief of the giants
138,I,the hapless wight a while had kept
139,I,since the Creator his exile doomed.
140,I,On kin of Cain was the killing avenged
141,I,by sovran God for slaughtered Abel.
142,I,"Ill fared his feud, {1f} and far was he driven,"
143,I,"for the slaughter's sake, from sight of men."
144,I,"Of Cain awoke all that woful breed,"
145,I,"Etins {1g} and elves and evil-spirits,"
146,I,as well as the giants that warred with God
147,I,weary while:  but their wage was paid them!
148,I,
149,I,
150,I,
151,II,II
152,II,
153,II,WENT he forth to find at fall of night
154,II,"that haughty house, and heed wherever"
155,II,"the Ring-Danes, outrevelled, to rest had gone."
156,II,Found within it the atheling band
157,II,"asleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow,"
158,II,"of human hardship. Unhallowed wight,"
159,II,"grim and greedy, he grasped betimes,"
160,II,"wrathful, reckless, from resting-places,"
161,II,"thirty of the thanes, and thence he rushed"
162,II,"fain of his fell spoil, faring homeward,"
163,II,"laden with slaughter, his lair to seek."
164,II,"Then at the dawning, as day was breaking,"
165,II,the might of Grendel to men was known;
166,II,"then after wassail was wail uplifted,"
167,II,"loud moan in the morn. The mighty chief,"
168,II,"atheling excellent, unblithe sat,"
169,II,"labored in woe for the loss of his thanes,"
170,II,"when once had been traced the trail of the fiend,"
171,II,"spirit accurst:  too cruel that sorrow,"
172,II,"too long, too loathsome. Not late the respite;"
173,II,"with night returning, anew began"
174,II,"ruthless murder; he recked no whit,"
175,II,"firm in his guilt, of the feud and crime."
176,II,They were easy to find who elsewhere sought
177,II,"in room remote their rest at night,"
178,II,"bed in the bowers, {2a} when that bale was shown,"
179,II,"was seen in sooth, with surest token, --"
180,II,the hall-thane's {2b} hate. Such held themselves
181,II,far and fast who the fiend outran!
182,II,Thus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill
183,II,one against all; until empty stood
184,II,"that lordly building, and long it bode so."
185,II,"Twelve years' tide the trouble he bore,"
186,II,"sovran of Scyldings, sorrows in plenty,"
187,II,boundless cares. There came unhidden
188,II,"tidings true to the tribes of men,"
189,II,"in sorrowful songs, how ceaselessly Grendel"
190,II,"harassed Hrothgar, what hate he bore him,"
191,II,"what murder and massacre, many a year,"
192,II,"feud unfading, -- refused consent"
193,II,"to deal with any of Daneland's earls,"
194,II,"make pact of peace, or compound for gold:"
195,II,still less did the wise men ween to get
196,II,great fee for the feud from his fiendish hands.
197,II,But the evil one ambushed old and young
198,II,"death-shadow dark, and dogged them still,"
199,II,"lured, or lurked in the livelong night"
200,II,of misty moorlands:  men may say not
201,II,where the haunts of these Hell-Runes {2c} be.
202,II,"Such heaping of horrors the hater of men,"
203,II,"lonely roamer, wrought unceasing,"
204,II,"harassings heavy. O'er Heorot he lorded,"
205,II,"gold-bright hall, in gloomy nights;"
206,II,"and ne'er could the prince {2d} approach his throne,"
207,II,"-- 'twas judgment of God, -- or have joy in his hall."
208,II,"Sore was the sorrow to Scyldings'-friend,"
209,II,heart-rending misery. Many nobles
210,II,"sat assembled, and searched out counsel"
211,II,how it were best for bold-hearted men
212,II,against harassing terror to try their hand.
213,II,Whiles they vowed in their heathen fanes
214,II,"altar-offerings, asked with words {2e}"
215,II,that the slayer-of-souls would succor give them
216,II,"for the pain of their people. Their practice this,"
217,II,their heathen hope; 'twas Hell they thought of
218,II,"in mood of their mind. Almighty they knew not,"
219,II,"Doomsman of Deeds and dreadful Lord,"
220,II,"nor Heaven's-Helmet heeded they ever,"
221,II,Wielder-of-Wonder. -- Woe for that man
222,II,who in harm and hatred hales his soul
223,II,to fiery embraces; -- nor favor nor change
224,II,awaits he ever. But well for him
225,II,"that after death-day may draw to his Lord,"
226,II,and friendship find in the Father's arms!
227,II,

230,III,III
231,III,
232,III,THUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene
233,III,with the woe of these days; not wisest men
234,III,"assuaged his sorrow; too sore the anguish,"
235,III,"loathly and long, that lay on his folk,"
236,III,most baneful of burdens and bales of the night.
237,III,
238,III,"This heard in his home Hygelac's thane,"
239,III,"great among Geats, of Grendel's doings."
240,III,He was the mightiest man of valor
241,III,"in that same day of this our life,"
242,III,stalwart and stately. A stout wave-walker
243,III,"he bade make ready. Yon battle-king, said he,"
244,III,"far o'er the swan-road he fain would seek,"
245,III,the noble monarch who needed men!
246,III,The prince's journey by prudent folk
247,III,"was little blamed, though they loved him dear;"
248,III,"they whetted the hero, and hailed good omens."
249,III,And now the bold one from bands of Geats
250,III,"comrades chose, the keenest of warriors"
251,III,e'er he could find; with fourteen men
252,III,"the sea-wood {3a} he sought, and, sailor proved,"
253,III,led them on to the land's confines.
254,III,"Time had now flown; {3b} afloat was the ship,"
255,III,"boat under bluff. On board they climbed,"
256,III,warriors ready; waves were churning
257,III,sea with sand; the sailors bore
258,III,"on the breast of the bark their bright array,"
259,III,"their mail and weapons:  the men pushed off,"
260,III,"on its willing way, the well-braced craft."
261,III,Then moved o'er the waters by might of the wind
262,III,"that bark like a bird with breast of foam,"
263,III,"till in season due, on the second day,"
264,III,the curved prow such course had run
265,III,"that sailors now could see the land,"
266,III,"sea-cliffs shining, steep high hills,"
267,III,"headlands broad. Their haven was found,"
268,III,their journey ended. Up then quickly
269,III,"the Weders' {3c} clansmen climbed ashore,"
270,III,"anchored their sea-wood, with armor clashing"
271,III,and gear of battle:  God they thanked
272,III,or passing in peace o'er the paths of the sea.
273,III,"Now saw from the cliff a Scylding clansman,"
274,III,"a warden that watched the water-side,"
275,III,"how they bore o'er the gangway glittering shields,"
276,III,war-gear in readiness; wonder seized him
277,III,to know what manner of men they were.
278,III,"Straight to the strand his steed he rode,"
279,III,Hrothgar's henchman; with hand of might
280,III,"he shook his spear, and spake in parley."
281,III,"""Who are ye, then, ye armed men,"
282,III,"mailed folk, that yon mighty vessel"
283,III,"have urged thus over the ocean ways,"
284,III,"here o'er the waters? A warden I,"
285,III,"sentinel set o'er the sea-march here,"
286,III,lest any foe to the folk of Danes
287,III,with harrying fleet should harm the land.
288,III,"No aliens ever at ease thus bore them,"
289,III,linden-wielders:  {3d} yet word-of-leave
290,III,"clearly ye lack from clansmen here,"
291,III,my folk's agreement. -- A greater ne'er saw I
292,III,"of warriors in world than is one of you, --"
293,III,yon hero in harness! No henchman he
294,III,"worthied by weapons, if witness his features,"
295,III,"his peerless presence! I pray you, though, tell"
296,III,"your folk and home, lest hence ye fare"
297,III,suspect to wander your way as spies
298,III,"in Danish land. Now, dwellers afar,"
299,III,"ocean-travellers, take from me"
300,III,simple advice:  the sooner the better
301,III,"I hear of the country whence ye came."""

305,IV,IV
306,IV,
307,IV,To him the stateliest spake in answer;
308,IV,the warriors' leader his word-hoard unlocked:  --
309,IV,"""We are by kin of the clan of Geats,"
310,IV,and Hygelac's own hearth-fellows we.
311,IV,"To folk afar was my father known,"
312,IV,"noble atheling, Ecgtheow named."
313,IV,"Full of winters, he fared away"
314,IV,aged from earth; he is honored still
315,IV,through width of the world by wise men all.
316,IV,To thy lord and liege in loyal mood
317,IV,"we hasten hither, to Healfdene's son,"
318,IV,people-protector:  be pleased to advise us!
319,IV,"To that mighty-one come we on mickle errand,"
320,IV,to the lord of the Danes; nor deem I right
321,IV,that aught be hidden. We hear -- thou knowest
322,IV,"if sooth it is -- the saying of men,"
323,IV,"that amid the Scyldings a scathing monster,"
324,IV,"dark ill-doer, in dusky nights"
325,IV,"shows terrific his rage unmatched,"
326,IV,hatred and murder. To Hrothgar I
327,IV,"in greatness of soul would succor bring,"
328,IV,"so the Wise-and-Brave {4a} may worst his foes, --"
329,IV,"if ever the end of ills is fated,"
330,IV,"of cruel contest, if cure shall follow,"
331,IV,and the boiling care-waves cooler grow;
332,IV,else ever afterward anguish-days
333,IV,he shall suffer in sorrow while stands in place
334,IV,"high on its hill that house unpeered!"""
335,IV,"Astride his steed, the strand-ward answered,"
336,IV,"clansman unquailing:  ""The keen-souled thane"
337,IV,must be skilled to sever and sunder duly
338,IV,"words and works, if he well intends."
339,IV,"I gather, this band is graciously bent"
340,IV,"to the Scyldings' master. March, then, bearing"
341,IV,weapons and weeds the way I show you.
342,IV,I will bid my men your boat meanwhile
343,IV,"to guard for fear lest foemen come, --"
344,IV,your new-tarred ship by shore of ocean
345,IV,faithfully watching till once again
346,IV,"it waft o'er the waters those well-loved thanes,"
347,IV,"-- winding-neck'd wood, -- to Weders' bounds,"
348,IV,heroes such as the hest of fate
349,IV,"shall succor and save from the shock of war."""
350,IV,"They bent them to march, -- the boat lay still,"
351,IV,"fettered by cable and fast at anchor,"
352,IV,broad-bosomed ship. -- Then shone the boars {4b}
353,IV,"over the cheek-guard; chased with gold,"
354,IV,"keen and gleaming, guard it kept"
355,IV,"o'er the man of war, as marched along"
356,IV,"heroes in haste, till the hall they saw,"
357,IV,broad of gable and bright with gold:
358,IV,"that was the fairest, 'mid folk of earth,"
359,IV,"of houses 'neath heaven, where Hrothgar lived,"
360,IV,and the gleam of it lightened o'er lands afar.
361,IV,The sturdy shieldsman showed that bright
362,IV,burg-of-the-boldest; bade them go
363,IV,"straightway thither; his steed then turned,"
364,IV,"hardy hero, and hailed them thus:  --"
365,IV,"""'Tis time that I fare from you. Father Almighty"
366,IV,"in grace and mercy guard you well,"
367,IV,"safe in your seekings. Seaward I go,"
368,IV,"'gainst hostile warriors hold my watch."""

372,V,V
373,V,
374,V,STONE-BRIGHT the street:  {5a} it showed the way
375,V,to the crowd of clansmen. Corselets glistened
376,V,"hand-forged, hard; on their harness bright"
377,V,"the steel ring sang, as they strode along"
378,V,"in mail of battle, and marched to the hall."
379,V,"There, weary of ocean, the wall along"
380,V,"they set their bucklers, their broad shields, down,"
381,V,"and bowed them to bench:  the breastplates clanged,"
382,V,"war-gear of men; their weapons stacked,"
383,V,"spears of the seafarers stood together,"
384,V,gray-tipped ash:  that iron band
385,V,was worthily weaponed! -- A warrior proud
386,V,asked of the heroes their home and kin.
387,V,"""Whence, now, bear ye burnished shields,"
388,V,"harness gray and helmets grim,"
389,V,"spears in multitude? Messenger, I,"
390,V,Hrothgar's herald! Heroes so many
391,V,ne'er met I as strangers of mood so strong.
392,V,"'Tis plain that for prowess, not plunged into exile,"
393,V,"for high-hearted valor, Hrothgar ye seek!"""
394,V,"Him the sturdy-in-war bespake with words,"
395,V,"proud earl of the Weders answer made,"
396,V,"hardy 'neath helmet:  -- ""Hygelac's, we,"
397,V,fellows at board; I am Beowulf named.
398,V,I am seeking to say to the son of Healfdene
399,V,"this mission of mine, to thy master-lord,"
400,V,"the doughty prince, if he deign at all"
401,V,"grace that we greet him, the good one, now."""
402,V,"Wulfgar spake, the Wendles' chieftain,"
403,V,"whose might of mind to many was known,"
404,V,"his courage and counsel:  ""The king of Danes,"
405,V,"the Scyldings' friend, I fain will tell,"
406,V,"the Breaker-of-Rings, as the boon thou askest,"
407,V,"the famed prince, of thy faring hither,"
408,V,"and, swiftly after, such answer bring"
409,V,"as the doughty monarch may deign to give."""
410,V,Hied then in haste to where Hrothgar sat
411,V,"white-haired and old, his earls about him,"
412,V,till the stout thane stood at the shoulder there
413,V,of the Danish king:  good courtier he!
414,V,Wulfgar spake to his winsome lord:  --
415,V,"""Hither have fared to thee far-come men"
416,V,"o'er the paths of ocean, people of Geatland;"

811,XI,"struck it,"
812,XI,"and baleful he burst in his blatant rage,"

817,XI,

828,XI,how he would fare in fell attack.
829,XI,Not that the monster was minded to pause!
830,XI,Straightway he seized a sleeping warrior
831,XI,"for the first, and tore him fiercely asunder,"
832,XI,"the bone-frame bit, drank blood in streams,"
833,XI,swallowed him piecemeal:  swiftly thus
834,XI,"the lifeless corse was clear devoured,"
835,XI,e'en feet and hands. Then farther he hied;
836,XI,"for the hardy hero with hand he grasped,"
837,XI,"felt for the foe with fiendish claw,"
838,XI,"for the hero reclining, -- who clutched it boldly,"
839,XI,"prompt to answer, propped on his arm."
840,XI,Soon then saw that shepherd-of-evils
841,XI,"that never he met in this middle-world,"
842,XI,"in the ways of earth, another wight"
843,XI,"with heavier hand-gripe; at heart he feared,"
844,XI,"sorrowed in soul, -- none the sooner escaped!"
845,XI,"Fain would he flee, his fastness seek,"
846,XI,the den of devils:  no doings now
847,XI,such as oft he had done in days of old!
848,XI,Then bethought him the hardy Hygelac-thane
849,XI,"of his boast at evening:  up he bounded,"
850,XI,"grasped firm his foe, whose fingers cracked."
851,XI,"The fiend made off, but the earl close followed."
852,XI,The monster meant -- if he might at all --
853,XI,"to fling himself free, and far away"
854,XI,"fly to the fens, -- knew his fingers' power"
855,XI,in the gripe of the grim one. Gruesome march
856,XI,to Heorot this monster of harm had made!
857,XI,"Din filled the room; the Danes were bereft,"
858,XI,"castle-dwellers and clansmen all,"
859,XI,"earls, of their ale. Angry were both"
860,XI,those savage hall-guards:  the house resounded.
861,XI,Wonder it was the wine-hall firm
862,XI,"in the strain of their struggle stood, to earth"
863,XI,the fair house fell not; too fast it was
864,XI,within and without by its iron bands
865,XI,craftily clamped; though there crashed from sill
866,XI,many a mead-bench -- men have told me --
867,XI,"gay with gold, where the grim foes wrestled."
868,XI,So well had weened the wisest Scyldings
869,XI,that not ever at all might any man
870,XI,"that bone-decked, brave house break asunder,"
871,XI,"crush by craft, -- unless clasp of fire"
872,XI,in smoke engulfed it. -- Again uprose
873,XI,din redoubled. Danes of the North
874,XI,"with fear and frenzy were filled, each one,"
875,XI,"who from the wall that wailing heard,"
876,XI,"God's foe sounding his grisly song,"
877,XI,"cry of the conquered, clamorous pain"
878,XI,from captive of hell. Too closely held him
879,XI,he who of men in might was strongest
880,XI,in that same day of this our life.
881,XI,
882,XI,
883,XI,
884,XII,XII
885,XII,
886,XII,NOT in any wise would the earls'-defence {12a}
887,XII,"suffer that slaughterous stranger to live,"
888,XII,useless deeming his days and years
889,XII,to men on earth. Now many an earl
890,XII,"of Beowulf brandished blade ancestral,"
891,XII,"fain the life of their lord to shield,"
892,XII,"their praised prince, if power were theirs;"
893,XII,"never they knew, -- as they neared the foe,"
894,XII,"hardy-hearted heroes of war,"
895,XII,aiming their swords on every side
896,XII,"the accursed to kill, -- no keenest blade,"
897,XII,"no farest of falchions fashioned on earth,"
898,XII,could harm or hurt that hideous fiend!
899,XII,"He was safe, by his spells, from sword of battle,"
900,XII,from edge of iron. Yet his end and parting
901,XII,on that same day of this our life
902,XII,"woful should be, and his wandering soul"
903,XII,far off flit to the fiends' domain.
904,XII,"Soon he found, who in former days,"
905,XII,"harmful in heart and hated of God,"
906,XII,"on many a man such murder wrought,"
907,XII,that the frame of his body failed him now.
908,XII,For him the keen-souled kinsman of Hygelac
909,XII,held in hand; hateful alive
910,XII,was each to other. The outlaw dire
911,XII,took mortal hurt; a mighty wound
912,XII,"showed on his shoulder, and sinews cracked,"
913,XII,and the bone-frame burst. To Beowulf now
914,XII,"the glory was given, and Grendel thence"
915,XII,"death-sick his den in the dark moor sought,"
916,XII,noisome abode:  he knew too well
917,XII,"that here was the last of life, an end"
918,XII,of his days on earth. -- To all the Danes
919,XII,by that bloody battle the boon had come.
920,XII,From ravage had rescued the roving stranger
921,XII,Hrothgar's hall; the hardy and wise one
922,XII,"had purged it anew. His night-work pleased him,"
923,XII,his deed and its honor. To Eastern Danes
924,XII,"had the valiant Geat his vaunt made good,"
925,XII,"all their sorrow and ills assuaged,"
926,XII,"their bale of battle borne so long,"
927,XII,and all the dole they erst endured
928,XII,"pain a-plenty. -- 'Twas proof of this,"
929,XII,"when the hardy-in-fight a hand laid down,"
930,XII,"arm and shoulder, -- all, indeed,"
931,XII,"of Grendel's gripe, -- 'neath the gabled roof."
932,XII,
933,XII,
934,XII,
935,XIII,XIII
936,XIII,
937,XIII,"MANY at morning, as men have told me,"
938,XIII,"warriors gathered the gift-hall round,"
939,XIII,"folk-leaders faring from far and near,"
940,XIII,"o'er wide-stretched ways, the wonder to view,"
941,XIII,trace of the traitor. Not troublous seemed
942,XIII,the enemy's end to any man
943,XIII,who saw by the gait of the graceless foe
944,XIII,"how the weary-hearted, away from thence,"
945,XIII,"baffled in battle and banned, his steps"
946,XIII,death-marked dragged to the devils' mere.
947,XIII,"Bloody the billows were boiling there,"
948,XIII,turbid the tide of tumbling waves
949,XIII,"horribly seething, with sword-blood hot,"
950,XIII,"by that doomed one dyed, who in den of the moor"
951,XIII,"laid forlorn his life adown,"
952,XIII,"his heathen soul, and hell received it."
953,XIII,Home then rode the hoary clansmen
954,XIII,"from that merry journey, and many a youth,"
955,XIII,"on horses white, the hardy warriors,"
956,XIII,back from the mere. Then Beowulf's glory
957,XIII,"eager they echoed, and all averred"
958,XIII,"that from sea to sea, or south or north,"
959,XIII,"there was no other in earth's domain,"
960,XIII,"under vault of heaven, more valiant found,"
961,XIII,of warriors none more worthy to rule!
962,XIII,"(On their lord beloved they laid no slight,"
963,XIII,gracious Hrothgar:  a good king he!)
964,XIII,"From time to time, the tried-in-battle"
965,XIII,"their gray steeds set to gallop amain,"
966,XIII,and ran a race when the road seemed fair.
967,XIII,"From time to time, a thane of the king,"
968,XIII,"who had made many vaunts, and was mindful of verses,"
969,XIII,"stored with sagas and songs of old,"
970,XIII,"bound word to word in well-knit rime,"
971,XIII,welded his lay; this warrior soon
972,XIII,"of Beowulf's quest right cleverly sang,"
973,XIII,"and artfully added an excellent tale,"
974,XIII,"in well-ranged words, of the warlike deeds"
975,XIII,he had heard in saga of Sigemund.
976,XIII,"Strange the story:  he said it all, --"
977,XIII,"the Waelsing's wanderings wide, his struggles,"
978,XIII,"which never were told to tribes of men,"
979,XIII,"the feuds and the frauds, save to Fitela only,"
980,XIII,"when of these doings he deigned to speak,"
981,XIII,uncle to nephew; as ever the twain
982,XIII,"stood side by side in stress of war,"
983,XIII,and multitude of the monster kind
984,XIII,"they had felled with their swords. Of Sigemund grew,"
985,XIII,"when he passed from life, no little praise;"
986,XIII,for the doughty-in-combat a dragon killed
987,XIII,that herded the hoard:  {13a} under hoary rock
988,XIII,the atheling dared the deed alone
989,XIII,"fearful quest, nor was Fitela there."
990,XIII,"Yet so it befell, his falchion pierced"
991,XIII,"that wondrous worm, -- on the wall it struck,"
992,XIII,best blade; the dragon died in its blood.
993,XIII,Thus had the dread-one by daring achieved
994,XIII,"over the ring-hoard to rule at will,"
995,XIII,"himself to pleasure; a sea-boat he loaded,"
996,XIII,"and bore on its bosom the beaming gold,"
997,XIII,son of Waels; the worm was consumed.
998,XIII,He had of all heroes the highest renown
999,XIII,"among races of men, this refuge-of-warriors,"
1000,XIII,for deeds of daring that decked his name
1001,XIII,since the hand and heart of Heremod
1002,XIII,"grew slack in battle. He, swiftly banished"
1003,XIII,"to mingle with monsters at mercy of foes,"
1004,XIII,to death was betrayed; for torrents of sorrow
1005,XIII,had lamed him too long; a load of care
1006,XIII,to earls and athelings all he proved.
1007,XIII,"Oft indeed, in earlier days,"
1008,XIII,"for the warrior's wayfaring wise men mourned,"
1009,XIII,"who had hoped of him help from harm and bale,"
1010,XIII,"and had thought their sovran's son would thrive,"
1011,XIII,"follow his father, his folk protect,"
1012,XIII,"the hoard and the stronghold, heroes' land,"
1013,XIII,"home of Scyldings. -- But here, thanes said,"
1014,XIII,the kinsman of Hygelac kinder seemed
1015,XIII,to all:  the other {13b} was urged to crime!
1016,XIII,"And afresh to the race, {13c} the fallow roads"
1017,XIII,by swift steeds measured! The morning sun
1018,XIII,was climbing higher. Clansmen hastened
1019,XIII,"to the high-built hall, those hardy-minded,"
1020,XIII,"the wonder to witness. Warden of treasure,"
1021,XIII,"crowned with glory, the king himself,"
1022,XIII,with stately band from the bride-bower strode;
1023,XIII,and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens
1024,XIII,measured the path to the mead-house fair.
1025,XIII,
1026,XIII,
1027,XIII,
1028,XIV,XIV
1029,XIV,
1030,XIV,"HROTHGAR spake, -- to the hall he went,"
1031,XIV,"stood by the steps, the steep roof saw,"
1032,XIV,"garnished with gold, and Grendel's hand:  --"
1033,XIV,"""For the sight I see to the Sovran Ruler"
1034,XIV,be speedy thanks! A throng of sorrows
1035,XIV,I have borne from Grendel; but God still works
1036,XIV,"wonder on wonder, the Warden-of-Glory."
1037,XIV,It was but now that I never more
1038,XIV,for woes that weighed on me waited help
1039,XIV,"long as I lived, when, laved in blood,"
1040,XIV,"stood sword-gore-stained this stateliest house, --"
1041,XIV,"widespread woe for wise men all,"
1042,XIV,who had no hope to hinder ever
1043,XIV,foes infernal and fiendish sprites
1044,XIV,"from havoc in hall. This hero now,"
1045,XIV,"by the Wielder's might, a work has done"
1046,XIV,that not all of us erst could ever do
1047,XIV,"by wile and wisdom. Lo, well can she say"
1048,XIV,whoso of women this warrior bore
1049,XIV,"among sons of men, if still she liveth,"
1050,XIV,that the God of the ages was good to her
1051,XIV,"in the birth of her bairn. Now, Beowulf, thee,"
1052,XIV,"of heroes best, I shall heartily love"
1053,XIV,"as mine own, my son; preserve thou ever"
1054,XIV,this kinship new:  thou shalt never lack
1055,XIV,wealth of the world that I wield as mine!
1056,XIV,"Full oft for less have I largess showered,"
1057,XIV,"my precious hoard, on a punier man,"
1058,XIV,less stout in struggle. Thyself hast now
1059,XIV,"fulfilled such deeds, that thy fame shall endure"
1060,XIV,"through all the ages. As ever he did,"
1061,XIV,"well may the Wielder reward thee still!"""
1062,XIV,"Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:  --"
1063,XIV,"""This work of war most willingly"
1064,XIV,"we have fought, this fight, and fearlessly dared"
1065,XIV,"force of the foe. Fain, too, were I"
1066,XIV,"hadst thou but seen himself, what time"
1067,XIV,the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall!
1068,XIV,"Swiftly, I thought, in strongest gripe"
1069,XIV,"on his bed of death to bind him down,"
1070,XIV,that he in the hent of this hand of mine
1071,XIV,should breathe his last:  but he broke away.
1072,XIV,Him I might not -- the Maker willed not --
1073,XIV,"hinder from flight, and firm enough hold"
1074,XIV,"the life-destroyer:  too sturdy was he,"
1075,XIV,"the ruthless, in running! For rescue, however,"
1076,XIV,"he left behind him his hand in pledge,"
1077,XIV,arm and shoulder; nor aught of help
1078,XIV,could the cursed one thus procure at all.
1079,XIV,"None the longer liveth he, loathsome fiend,"
1080,XIV,"sunk in his sins, but sorrow holds him"
1081,XIV,"tightly grasped in gripe of anguish,"
1082,XIV,"in baleful bonds, where bide he must,"
1083,XIV,"evil outlaw, such awful doom"
1084,XIV,"as the Mighty Maker shall mete him out."""
1085,XIV,
1086,XIV,More silent seemed the son of Ecglaf {14a}
1087,XIV,"in boastful speech of his battle-deeds,"
1088,XIV,"since athelings all, through the earl's great prowess,"
1089,XIV,"beheld that hand, on the high roof gazing,"
1090,XIV,"foeman's fingers, -- the forepart of each"
1091,XIV,"of the sturdy nails to steel was likest, --"
1092,XIV,"heathen's ""hand-spear,"" hostile warrior's"
1093,XIV,"claw uncanny. 'Twas clear, they said,"
1094,XIV,"that him no blade of the brave could touch,"
1095,XIV,"how keen soever, or cut away"
1096,XIV,that battle-hand bloody from baneful foe.
1097,XIV,
1098,XIV,
1099,XIV,
1100,XV,XV
1101,XV,
1102,XV,THERE was hurry and hest in Heorot now
1103,XV,"for hands to bedeck it, and dense was the throng"
1104,XV,"of men and women the wine-hall to cleanse,"
1105,XV,the guest-room to garnish. Gold-gay shone the hangings
1106,XV,"that were wove on the wall, and wonders many"
1107,XV,to delight each mortal that looks upon them.
1108,XV,"Though braced within by iron bands,"
1109,XV,that building bright was broken sorely; {15a}
1110,XV,rent were its hinges; the roof alone
1111,XV,"held safe and sound, when, seared with crime,"
1112,XV,"the fiendish foe his flight essayed,"
1113,XV,"of life despairing. -- No light thing that,"
1114,XV,"the flight for safety, -- essay it who will!"
1115,XV,"Forced of fate, he shall find his way"
1116,XV,"to the refuge ready for race of man,"
1117,XV,"for soul-possessors, and sons of earth;"
1118,XV,and there his body on bed of death
1119,XV,shall rest after revel.
1120,XV,Arrived was the hour
1121,XV,when to hall proceeded Healfdene's son:
1122,XV,the king himself would sit to banquet.
1123,XV,Ne'er heard I of host in haughtier throng
1124,XV,more graciously gathered round giver-of-rings!
1125,XV,"Bowed then to bench those bearers-of-glory,"
1126,XV,fain of the feasting. Featly received
1127,XV,"many a mead-cup the mighty-in-spirit,"
1128,XV,"kinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall,"
1129,XV,Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot now
1130,XV,was filled with friends; the folk of Scyldings
1131,XV,ne'er yet had tried the traitor's deed.
1132,XV,To Beowulf gave the bairn of Healfdene
1133,XV,"a gold-wove banner, guerdon of triumph,"
1134,XV,"broidered battle-flag, breastplate and helmet;"
1135,XV,and a splendid sword was seen of many
1136,XV,borne to the brave one. Beowulf took
1137,XV,cup in hall:  {15b} for such costly gifts
1138,XV,he suffered no shame in that soldier throng.
1139,XV,"For I heard of few heroes, in heartier mood,"
1140,XV,"with four such gifts, so fashioned with gold,"
1141,XV,on the ale-bench honoring others thus!
1142,XV,"O'er the roof of the helmet high, a ridge,"
1143,XV,"wound with wires, kept ward o'er the head,"
1144,XV,"lest the relict-of-files {15c} should fierce invade,"
1145,XV,"sharp in the strife, when that shielded hero"
1146,XV,should go to grapple against his foes.
1147,XV,Then the earls'-defence {15d} on the floor {15e} bade lead
1148,XV,"coursers eight, with carven head-gear,"
1149,XV,adown the hall:  one horse was decked
1150,XV,with a saddle all shining and set in jewels;
1151,XV,"'twas the battle-seat of the best of kings,"
1152,XV,when to play of swords the son of Healfdene
1153,XV,was fain to fare. Ne'er failed his valor
1154,XV,in the crush of combat when corpses fell.
1155,XV,To Beowulf over them both then gave
1156,XV,"the refuge-of-Ingwines right and power,"
1157,XV,o'er war-steeds and weapons:  wished him joy of them.
1158,XV,"Manfully thus the mighty prince,"
1159,XV,"hoard-guard for heroes, that hard fight repaid"
1160,XV,with steeds and treasures contemned by none
1161,XV,who is willing to say the sooth aright.
1162,XV,
1163,XV,
1164,XV,
1165,XVI,XVI
1166,XVI,
1167,XVI,"AND the lord of earls, to each that came"
1168,XVI,"with Beowulf over the briny ways,"
1169,XVI,"an heirloom there at the ale-bench gave,"
1170,XVI,precious gift; and the price {16a} bade pay
1171,XVI,in gold for him whom Grendel erst
1172,XVI,"murdered, -- and fain of them more had killed,"
1173,XVI,"had not wisest God their Wyrd averted,"
1174,XVI,and the man's {16b} brave mood. The Maker then
1175,XVI,"ruled human kind, as here and now."
1176,XVI,"Therefore is insight always best,"
1177,XVI,and forethought of mind. How much awaits him
1178,XVI,"of lief and of loath, who long time here,"
1179,XVI,through days of warfare this world endures!
1180,XVI,
1181,XVI,Then song and music mingled sounds
1182,XVI,in the presence of Healfdene's head-of-armies {16c}
1183,XVI,and harping was heard with the hero-lay
1184,XVI,as Hrothgar's singer the hall-joy woke
1185,XVI,"along the mead-seats, making his song"
1186,XVI,of that sudden raid on the sons of Finn. {16d}
1187,XVI,"Healfdene's hero, Hnaef the Scylding,"
1188,XVI,was fated to fall in the Frisian slaughter. {16e}
1189,XVI,Hildeburh needed not hold in value
1190,XVI,her enemies' honor! {16f} Innocent both
1191,XVI,"were the loved ones she lost at the linden-play,"
1192,XVI,"bairn and brother, they bowed to fate,"
1193,XVI,stricken by spears; 'twas a sorrowful woman!
1194,XVI,None doubted why the daughter of Hoc
1195,XVI,"bewailed her doom when dawning came,"
1196,XVI,"and under the sky she saw them lying,"
1197,XVI,"kinsmen murdered, where most she had kenned"
1198,XVI,"of the sweets of the world! By war were swept, too,"
1199,XVI,"Finn's own liegemen, and few were left;"
1200,XVI,in the parleying-place {16g} he could ply no longer
1201,XVI,"weapon, nor war could he wage on Hengest,"
1202,XVI,and rescue his remnant by right of arms
1203,XVI,from the prince's thane. A pact he offered:
1204,XVI,"another dwelling the Danes should have,"
1205,XVI,"hall and high-seat, and half the power"
1206,XVI,should fall to them in Frisian land;
1207,XVI,"and at the fee-gifts, Folcwald's son"
1208,XVI,"day by day the Danes should honor,"
1209,XVI,"the folk of Hengest favor with rings,"
1210,XVI,"even as truly, with treasure and jewels,"
1211,XVI,"with fretted gold, as his Frisian kin"
1212,XVI,he meant to honor in ale-hall there.
1213,XVI,Pact of peace they plighted further
1214,XVI,on both sides firmly. Finn to Hengest
1215,XVI,"with oath, upon honor, openly promised"
1216,XVI,"that woful remnant, with wise-men's aid,"
1217,XVI,"nobly to govern, so none of the guests"
1218,XVI,"by word or work should warp the treaty, {16h}"
1219,XVI,or with malice of mind bemoan themselves
1220,XVI,"as forced to follow their fee-giver's slayer,"
1221,XVI,"lordless men, as their lot ordained."
1222,XVI,"Should Frisian, moreover, with foeman's taunt,"
1223,XVI,"that murderous hatred to mind recall,"
1224,XVI,then edge of the sword must seal his doom.
1225,XVI,
1226,XVI,"Oaths were given, and ancient gold"
1227,XVI,"heaped from hoard. -- The hardy Scylding,"
1228,XVI,"battle-thane best, {16i} on his balefire lay."
1229,XVI,All on the pyre were plain to see
1230,XVI,"the gory sark, the gilded swine-crest,"
1231,XVI,"boar of hard iron, and athelings many"
1232,XVI,slain by the sword:  at the slaughter they fell.
1233,XVI,"It was Hildeburh's hest, at Hnaef's own pyre"
1234,XVI,"the bairn of her body on brands to lay,"
1235,XVI,"his bones to burn, on the balefire placed,"
1236,XVI,at his uncle's side. In sorrowful dirges
1237,XVI,bewept them the woman:  great wailing ascended.
1238,XVI,"Then wound up to welkin the wildest of death-fires,"
1239,XVI,"roared o'er the hillock:  {16j} heads all were melted,"
1240,XVI,"gashes burst, and blood gushed out"
1241,XVI,"from bites {16k} of the body. Balefire devoured,"
1242,XVI,"greediest spirit, those spared not by war"
1243,XVI,out of either folk:  their flower was gone.
1244,XVI,
1245,XVI,
1246,XVI,
1247,XVII,XVII
1248,XVII,
1249,XVII,"THEN hastened those heroes their home to see,"
1250,XVII,"friendless, to find the Frisian land,"
1251,XVII,houses and high burg. Hengest still
1252,XVII,"through the death-dyed winter dwelt with Finn,"
1253,XVII,"holding pact, yet of home he minded,"
1254,XVII,though powerless his ring-decked prow to drive
1255,XVII,"over the waters, now waves rolled fierce"
1256,XVII,"lashed by the winds, or winter locked them"
1257,XVII,in icy fetters. Then fared another
1258,XVII,"year to men's dwellings, as yet they do,"
1259,XVII,"the sunbright skies, that their season ever"
1260,XVII,duly await. Far off winter was driven;
1261,XVII,"fair lay earth's breast; and fain was the rover,"
1262,XVII,"the guest, to depart, though more gladly he pondered"
1263,XVII,"on wreaking his vengeance than roaming the deep,"
1264,XVII,and how to hasten the hot encounter
1265,XVII,where sons of the Frisians were sure to be.
1266,XVII,"So he escaped not the common doom,"
1267,XVII,"when Hun with ""Lafing,"" the light-of-battle,"
1268,XVII,"best of blades, his bosom pierced:"
1269,XVII,its edge was famed with the Frisian earls.
1270,XVII,"On fierce-heart Finn there fell likewise,"
1271,XVII,"on himself at home, the horrid sword-death;"
1272,XVII,for Guthlaf and Oslaf of grim attack
1273,XVII,"had sorrowing told, from sea-ways landed,"
1274,XVII,mourning their woes. {17a} Finn's wavering spirit
1275,XVII,bode not in breast. The burg was reddened
1276,XVII,"with blood of foemen, and Finn was slain,"
1277,XVII,king amid clansmen; the queen was taken.
1278,XVII,To their ship the Scylding warriors bore
1279,XVII,"all the chattels the chieftain owned,"
1280,XVII,whatever they found in Finn's domain
1281,XVII,of gems and jewels. The gentle wife
1282,XVII,"o'er paths of the deep to the Danes they bore,"
1283,XVII,led to her land.
1284,XVII,"The lay was finished,"
1285,XVII,the gleeman's song. Then glad rose the revel;
1286,XVII,bench-joy brightened. Bearers draw
1287,XVII,"from their ""wonder-vats"" wine. Comes Wealhtheow forth,"
1288,XVII,"under gold-crown goes where the good pair sit,"
1289,XVII,"uncle and nephew, true each to the other one,"
1290,XVII,kindred in amity. Unferth the spokesman
1291,XVII,"at the Scylding lord's feet sat:  men had faith in his spirit,"
1292,XVII,"his keenness of courage, though kinsmen had found him"
1293,XVII,unsure at the sword-play. The Scylding queen spoke:
1294,XVII,"""Quaff of this cup, my king and lord,"
1295,XVII,"breaker of rings, and blithe be thou,"
1296,XVII,gold-friend of men; to the Geats here speak
1297,XVII,such words of mildness as man should use.
1298,XVII,"Be glad with thy Geats; of those gifts be mindful,"
1299,XVII,"or near or far, which now thou hast."
1300,XVII,
1301,XVII,"Men say to me, as son thou wishest"
1302,XVII,"yon hero to hold. Thy Heorot purged,"
1303,XVII,"jewel-hall brightest, enjoy while thou canst,"
1304,XVII,with many a largess; and leave to thy kin
1305,XVII,folk and realm when forth thou goest
1306,XVII,to greet thy doom. For gracious I deem
1307,XVII,"my Hrothulf, {17b} willing to hold and rule"
1308,XVII,"nobly our youths, if thou yield up first,"
1309,XVII,"prince of Scyldings, thy part in the world."
1310,XVII,I ween with good he will well requite

1314,XVII,"Then she turned to the seat where her sons wereplaced,"

1325,XVIII,"she offered, to honor him, arm-jewels twain,"
1326,XVIII,"corselet and rings, and of collars the noblest"
1327,XVIII,that ever I knew the earth around.
1328,XVIII,"Ne'er heard I so mighty, 'neath heaven's dome,"
1329,XVIII,"a hoard-gem of heroes, since Hama bore"
1330,XVIII,"to his bright-built burg the Brisings' necklace,"
1331,XVIII,"jewel and gem casket. -- Jealousy fled he,"
1332,XVIII,Eormenric's hate:  chose help eternal.
1333,XVIII,"Hygelac Geat, grandson of Swerting,"
1334,XVIII,"on the last of his raids this ring bore with him,"
1335,XVIII,"under his banner the booty defending,"
1336,XVIII,the war-spoil warding; but Wyrd o'erwhelmed him
1337,XVIII,"what time, in his daring, dangers he sought,"
1338,XVIII,feud with Frisians. Fairest of gems
1339,XVIII,"he bore with him over the beaker-of-waves,"
1340,XVIII,sovran strong:  under shield he died.
1341,XVIII,"Fell the corpse of the king into keeping of Franks,"
1342,XVIII,"gear of the breast, and that gorgeous ring;"
1343,XVIII,"weaker warriors won the spoil,"
1344,XVIII,"after gripe of battle, from Geatland's lord,"
1345,XVIII,and held the death-field.
1346,XVIII,Din rose in hall.
1347,XVIII,"Wealhtheow spake amid warriors, and said:  --"

1360,XVIII,"Here every earl to the other is true,"

1362,XVIII,"Thanes are friendly, the throng obedient,"
1363,XVIII,"liegemen are revelling:  list and obey!"""
1364,XVIII,Went then to her place. -- That was proudest of feasts;
1365,XVIII,"flowed wine for the warriors. Wyrd they knew not,"
1366,XVIII,"destiny dire, and the doom to be seen"
1367,XVIII,"by many an earl when eve should come,"
1368,XVIII,"and Hrothgar homeward hasten away,"
1369,XVIII,"royal, to rest. The room was guarded"
1370,XVIII,"by an army of earls, as erst was done."
1371,XVIII,They bared the bench-boards; abroad they spread
1372,XVIII,beds and bolsters. -- One beer-carouser
1373,XVIII,in danger of doom lay down in the hall. --
1374,XVIII,
1375,XVIII,"At their heads they set their shields of war,"
1376,XVIII,bucklers bright; on the bench were there
1377,XVIII,"over each atheling, easy to see,"
1378,XVIII,"the high battle-helmet, the haughty spear,"
1379,XVIII,the corselet of rings. 'Twas their custom so
1380,XVIII,"ever to be for battle prepared,"
1381,XVIII,"at home, or harrying, which it were,"
1382,XVIII,even as oft as evil threatened
1383,XVIII,their sovran king. -- They were clansmen good.

1389,XIX,THEN sank they to sleep. With sorrow one bought
1390,XIX,"his rest of the evening, -- as ofttime had happened"
1391,XIX,"when Grendel guarded that golden hall,"
1392,XIX,"evil wrought, till his end drew nigh,"
1393,XIX,slaughter for sins. 'Twas seen and told
1394,XIX,"how an avenger survived the fiend,"
1395,XIX,as was learned afar. The livelong time
1396,XIX,"after that grim fight, Grendel's mother,"
1397,XIX,"monster of women, mourned her woe."
1398,XIX,"She was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters,"
1399,XIX,"cold sea-courses, since Cain cut down"
1400,XIX,"with edge of the sword his only brother,"
1401,XIX,"his father's offspring:  outlawed he fled,"
1402,XIX,"marked with murder, from men's delights"
1403,XIX,warded the wilds. -- There woke from him
1404,XIX,"such fate-sent ghosts as Grendel, who,"
1405,XIX,"war-wolf horrid, at Heorot found"
1406,XIX,"a warrior watching and waiting the fray,"
1407,XIX,with whom the grisly one grappled amain.
1408,XIX,"But the man remembered his mighty power,"
1409,XIX,"the glorious gift that God had sent him,"
1410,XIX,in his Maker's mercy put his trust
1411,XIX,"for comfort and help:  so he conquered the foe,"
1412,XIX,"felled the fiend, who fled abject,"
1413,XIX,"reft of joy, to the realms of death,"
1414,XIX,"mankind's foe. And his mother now,"
1415,XIX,"gloomy and grim, would go that quest"
1416,XIX,"of sorrow, the death of her son to avenge."
1417,XIX,"To Heorot came she, where helmeted Danes"
1418,XIX,slept in the hall. Too soon came back
1419,XIX,"old ills of the earls, when in she burst,"
1420,XIX,"the mother of Grendel. Less grim, though, that terror,"
1421,XIX,"e'en as terror of woman in war is less,"
1422,XIX,"might of maid, than of men in arms"
1423,XIX,"when, hammer-forged, the falchion hard,"
1424,XIX,"sword gore-stained, through swine of the helm,"
1425,XIX,"crested, with keen blade carves amain."
1426,XIX,"Then was in hall the hard-edge drawn,"
1427,XIX,"the swords on the settles, {19a} and shields a-many"
1428,XIX,firm held in hand:  nor helmet minded
1429,XIX,"nor harness of mail, whom that horror seized."
1430,XIX,Haste was hers; she would hie afar
1431,XIX,and save her life when the liegemen saw her.
1432,XIX,Yet a single atheling up she seized
1433,XIX,"fast and firm, as she fled to the moor."
1434,XIX,"He was for Hrothgar of heroes the dearest,"
1435,XIX,"of trusty vassals betwixt the seas,"
1436,XIX,"whom she killed on his couch, a clansman famous,"
1437,XIX,in battle brave. -- Nor was Beowulf there;
1438,XIX,"another house had been held apart,"
1439,XIX,"after giving of gold, for the Geat renowned. --"
1440,XIX,"Uproar filled Heorot; the hand all had viewed,"
1441,XIX,"blood-flecked, she bore with her; bale was returned,"
1442,XIX,dole in the dwellings:  'twas dire exchange
1443,XIX,where Dane and Geat were doomed to give
1444,XIX,"the lives of loved ones. Long-tried king,"
1445,XIX,"the hoary hero, at heart was sad"
1446,XIX,"when he knew his noble no more lived,"
1447,XIX,and dead indeed was his dearest thane.
1448,XIX,"To his bower was Beowulf brought in haste,"
1449,XIX,"dauntless victor. As daylight broke,"
1450,XIX,"along with his earls the atheling lord,"
1451,XIX,"with his clansmen, came where the king abode"
1452,XIX,waiting to see if the Wielder-of-All
1453,XIX,would turn this tale of trouble and woe.
1454,XIX,"Strode o'er floor the famed-in-strife,"
1455,XIX,"with his hand-companions, -- the hall resounded, --"
1456,XIX,"wishing to greet the wise old king,"

1470,XX,"when warriors clashed and we warded our heads,"

1472,XX,should be every earl as Aeschere was!
1473,XX,But here in Heorot a hand hath slain him
1474,XX,"of wandering death-sprite. I wot not whither, {20a}"
1475,XX,"proud of the prey, her path she took,"

1484,XX,"so that many a thane shall think, who e'er"
1485,XX,"sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings,"

1494,XX,"of womankind; and one, accursed,"
1495,XX,in man's guise trod the misery-track
1496,XX,"of exile, though huger than human bulk."
1497,XX,"Grendel in days long gone they named him,"
1498,XX,"folk of the land; his father they knew not,"
1499,XX,nor any brood that was born to him
1500,XX,of treacherous spirits. Untrod is their home;

1502,XX,"fenways fearful, where flows the stream"
1503,XX,"from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks,"
1504,XX,underground flood. Not far is it hence
1505,XX,"in measure of miles that the mere expands,"

1534,XXI,Each of us all must his end abide
1535,XXI,in the ways of the world; so win who may

1537,XXI,that is the warrior's worthiest doom.
1538,XXI,"Rise, O realm-warder! Ride we anon,"
1539,XXI,and mark the trail of the mother of Grendel.
1540,XXI,No harbor shall hide her -- heed my promise! --
1541,XXI,enfolding of field or forested mountain
1542,XXI,"or floor of the flood, let her flee where she will!"
1543,XXI,"But thou this day endure in patience,"
1544,XXI,"as I ween thou wilt, thy woes each one."""
1545,XXI,"Leaped up the graybeard:  God he thanked,"
1546,XXI,"mighty Lord, for the man's brave words."
1547,XXI,For Hrothgar soon a horse was saddled
1548,XXI,wave-maned steed. The sovran wise
1549,XXI,stately rode on; his shield-armed men
1550,XXI,followed in force. The footprints led
1551,XXI,"along the woodland, widely seen,"
1552,XXI,"a path o'er the plain, where she passed, and trod"
1553,XXI,the murky moor; of men-at-arms
1554,XXI,"she bore the bravest and best one, dead,"
1555,XXI,him who with Hrothgar the homestead ruled.
1556,XXI,On then went the atheling-born
1557,XXI,"o'er stone-cliffs steep and strait defiles,"
1558,XXI,"narrow passes and unknown ways,"
1559,XXI,"headlands sheer, and the haunts of the Nicors."
1560,XXI,"Foremost he {21a} fared, a few at his side"
1561,XXI,"of the wiser men, the ways to scan,"
1562,XXI,till he found in a flash the forested hill
1563,XXI,"hanging over the hoary rock,"
1564,XXI,a woful wood:  the waves below
1565,XXI,were dyed in blood. The Danish men
1566,XXI,"had sorrow of soul, and for Scyldings all,"
1567,XXI,"for many a hero, 'twas hard to bear,"
1568,XXI,"ill for earls, when Aeschere's head"
1569,XXI,they found by the flood on the foreland there.
1570,XXI,"Waves were welling, the warriors saw,"
1571,XXI,hot with blood; but the horn sang oft
1572,XXI,"battle-song bold. The band sat down,"
1573,XXI,"and watched on the water worm-like things,"
1574,XXI,"sea-dragons strange that sounded the deep,"
1575,XXI,and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness --
1576,XXI,such as oft essay at hour of morn
1577,XXI,"on the road-of-sails their ruthless quest, --"
1578,XXI,"and sea-snakes and monsters. These started away,"
1579,XXI,"swollen and savage that song to hear,"
1580,XXI,"that war-horn's blast. The warden of Geats,"
1581,XXI,"with bolt from bow, then balked of life,"
1582,XXI,"of wave-work, one monster, amid its heart"
1583,XXI,went the keen war-shaft; in water it seemed
1584,XXI,less doughty in swimming whom death had seized.
1585,XXI,"Swift on the billows, with boar-spears well"
1586,XXI,"hooked and barbed, it was hard beset,"
1587,XXI,"done to death and dragged on the headland,"
1588,XXI,wave-roamer wondrous. Warriors viewed
1589,XXI,the grisly guest.
1590,XXI,Then girt him Beowulf
1591,XXI,"in martial mail, nor mourned for his life."
1592,XXI,"His breastplate broad and bright of hues,"
1593,XXI,"woven by hand, should the waters try;"
1594,XXI,well could it ward the warrior's body
1595,XXI,that battle should break on his breast in vain
1596,XXI,nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe.
1597,XXI,And the helmet white that his head protected
1598,XXI,"was destined to dare the deeps of the flood,"
1599,XXI,"through wave-whirl win:  'twas wound with chains,"
1600,XXI,"decked with gold, as in days of yore"
1601,XXI,"the weapon-smith worked it wondrously,"
1602,XXI,"with swine-forms set it, that swords nowise,"
1603,XXI,"brandished in battle, could bite that helm."
1604,XXI,Nor was that the meanest of mighty helps
1605,XXI,which Hrothgar's orator offered at need:
1606,XXI,"""Hrunting"" they named the hilted sword,"
1607,XXI,of old-time heirlooms easily first;

1609,XXI,"with battle-blood hardened, nor blenched it at fight"
1610,XXI,"in hero's hand who held it ever,"
1611,XXI,on paths of peril prepared to go
1612,XXI,to folkstead {21b} of foes. Not first time this
1613,XXI,it was destined to do a daring task.
1614,XXI,"For he bore not in mind, the bairn of Ecglaf"
1615,XXI,"sturdy and strong, that speech he had made,"
1616,XXI,"drunk with wine, now this weapon he lent"
1617,XXI,"to a stouter swordsman. Himself, though, durst not"
1618,XXI,under welter of waters wager his life

1650,XXII,closed o'er the hero. Long while of the day
1651,XXII,fled ere he felt the floor of the sea.
1652,XXII,
1653,XXII,Soon found the fiend who the flood-domain
1654,XXII,"sword-hungry held these hundred winters,"
1655,XXII,"greedy and grim, that some guest from above,"
1656,XXII,"some man, was raiding her monster-realm."
1657,XXII,"She grasped out for him with grisly claws,"
1658,XXII,and the warrior seized; yet scathed she not
1659,XXII,"his body hale; the breastplate hindered,"
1660,XXII,"as she strove to shatter the sark of war,"
1661,XXII,"the linked harness, with loathsome hand."
1662,XXII,"Then bore this brine-wolf, when bottom she touched,"

1665,XXII,weapon to wield against wondrous monsters
1666,XXII,that sore beset him; sea-beasts many
1667,XXII,"tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail,"
1668,XXII,and swarmed on the stranger. But soon he marked
1669,XXII,"he was now in some hall, he knew not which,"
1670,XXII,"where water never could work him harm,"
1671,XXII,nor through the roof could reach him ever

1674,XXII,"Then the warrior was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep,"

1676,XXII,"he swung his blade, and the blow withheld not."
1677,XXII,Then sang on her head that seemly blade
1678,XXII,its war-song wild. But the warrior found
1679,XXII,"the light-of-battle {22a} was loath to bite,"
1680,XXII,to harm the heart:  its hard edge failed
1681,XXII,"the noble at need, yet had known of old"

1688,XXII,the angry earl; on earth it lay
1689,XXII,"steel-edged and stiff. His strength he trusted,"
1690,XXII,hand-gripe of might. So man shall do
1691,XXII,whenever in war he weens to earn him
1692,XXII,"lasting fame, nor fears for his life!"
1693,XXII,"Seized then by shoulder, shrank not from combat,"
1694,XXII,the Geatish war-prince Grendel's mother.
1695,XXII,"Flung then the fierce one, filled with wrath,"
1696,XXII,"his deadly foe, that she fell to ground."
1697,XXII,Swift on her part she paid him back
1698,XXII,"with grisly grasp, and grappled with him."
1699,XXII,"Spent with struggle, stumbled the warrior,"
1700,XXII,"fiercest of fighting-men, fell adown."
1701,XXII,"On the hall-guest she hurled herself, hent her short sword,"
1702,XXII,"broad and brown-edged, {22b} the bairn to avenge,"
1703,XXII,the sole-born son. -- On his shoulder lay
1704,XXII,"braided breast-mail, barring death,"
1705,XXII,withstanding entrance of edge or blade.
1706,XXII,"Life would have ended for Ecgtheow's son,"
1707,XXII,"under wide earth for that earl of Geats,"
1708,XXII,"had his armor of war not aided him,"
1709,XXII,"battle-net hard, and holy God"
1710,XXII,"wielded the victory, wisest Maker."
1711,XXII,The Lord of Heaven allowed his cause;
1712,XXII,and easily rose the earl erect.
1713,XXII,
1714,XXII,
1715,XXII,
1716,XXII,
1717,XXIII,XXIII
1718,XXIII,
1719,XXIII,"'MID the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant,"
1720,XXIII,"old-sword of Eotens, with edge of proof,"
1721,XXIII,"warriors' heirloom, weapon unmatched,"
1722,XXIII,-- save only 'twas more than other men
1723,XXIII,to bandy-of-battle could bear at all --
1724,XXIII,"as the giants had wrought it, ready and keen."
1725,XXIII,"Seized then its chain-hilt the Scyldings' chieftain,"
1726,XXIII,"bold and battle-grim, brandished the sword,"
1727,XXIII,"reckless of life, and so wrathfully smote"
1728,XXIII,"that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard,"
1729,XXIII,her bone-rings breaking:  the blade pierced through
1730,XXIII,that fated-one's flesh:  to floor she sank.
1731,XXIII,Bloody the blade:  he was blithe of his deed.
1732,XXIII,Then blazed forth light. 'Twas bright within
1733,XXIII,as when from the sky there shines unclouded
1734,XXIII,heaven's candle. The hall he scanned.
1735,XXIII,By the wall then went he; his weapon raised
1736,XXIII,"high by its hilts the Hygelac-thane,"
1737,XXIII,angry and eager. That edge was not useless
1738,XXIII,to the warrior now. He wished with speed
1739,XXIII,"Grendel to guerdon for grim raids many,"
1740,XXIII,for the war he waged on Western-Danes
1741,XXIII,"oftener far than an only time,"
1742,XXIII,when of Hrothgar's hearth-companions
1743,XXIII,"he slew in slumber, in sleep devoured,"
1744,XXIII,"fifteen men of the folk of Danes,"
1745,XXIII,"and as many others outward bore,"
1746,XXIII,his horrible prey. Well paid for that
1747,XXIII,the wrathful prince! For now prone he saw
1748,XXIII,"Grendel stretched there, spent with war,"
1749,XXIII,"spoiled of life, so scathed had left him"
1750,XXIII,Heorot's battle. The body sprang far
1751,XXIII,"when after death it endured the blow,"
1752,XXIII,"sword-stroke savage, that severed its head."
1753,XXIII,"Soon, {23a} then, saw the sage companions"
1754,XXIII,"who waited with Hrothgar, watching the flood,"
1755,XXIII,"that the tossing waters turbid grew,"
1756,XXIII,"blood-stained the mere. Old men together,"
1757,XXIII,"hoary-haired, of the hero spake;"
1758,XXIII,"the warrior would not, they weened, again,"
1759,XXIII,"proud of conquest, come to seek"
1760,XXIII,their mighty master. To many it seemed
1761,XXIII,the wolf-of-the-waves had won his life.
1762,XXIII,The ninth hour came. The noble Scyldings
1763,XXIII,left the headland; homeward went
1764,XXIII,"the gold-friend of men. {23b} But the guests sat on,"
1765,XXIII,"stared at the surges, sick in heart,"
1766,XXIII,"and wished, yet weened not, their winsome lord"
1767,XXIII,again to see.
1768,XXIII,
1769,XXIII,"Now that sword began,"
1770,XXIII,"from blood of the fight, in battle-droppings, {23c}"
1771,XXIII,"war-blade, to wane:  'twas a wondrous thing"
1772,XXIII,that all of it melted as ice is wont
1773,XXIII,"when frosty fetters the Father loosens,"
1774,XXIII,"unwinds the wave-bonds, wielding all"
1775,XXIII,seasons and times:  the true God he!
1776,XXIII,Nor took from that dwelling the duke of the Geats
1777,XXIII,save only the head and that hilt withal
1778,XXIII,"blazoned with jewels:  the blade had melted,"
1779,XXIII,"burned was the bright sword, her blood was so hot,"
1780,XXIII,so poisoned the hell-sprite who perished within there.
1781,XXIII,Soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat
1782,XXIII,downfall of demons; up-dove through the flood.
1783,XXIII,"The clashing waters were cleansed now,"
1784,XXIII,"waste of waves, where the wandering fiend"
1785,XXIII,her life-days left and this lapsing world.
1786,XXIII,"Swam then to strand the sailors'-refuge,"
1787,XXIII,"sturdy-in-spirit, of sea-booty glad,"
1788,XXIII,of burden brave he bore with him.
1789,XXIII,"Went then to greet him, and God they thanked,"
1790,XXIII,"the thane-band choice of their chieftain blithe,"
1791,XXIII,that safe and sound they could see him again.
1792,XXIII,Soon from the hardy one helmet and armor
1793,XXIII,"deftly they doffed:  now drowsed the mere,"
1794,XXIII,"water 'neath welkin, with war-blood stained."
1795,XXIII,"Forth they fared by the footpaths thence,"
1796,XXIII,"merry at heart the highways measured,"
1797,XXIII,well-known roads. Courageous men
1798,XXIII,"carried the head from the cliff by the sea,"
1799,XXIII,"an arduous task for all the band,"
1800,XXIII,"the firm in fight, since four were needed"
1801,XXIII,on the shaft-of-slaughter {23d} strenuously
1802,XXIII,to bear to the gold-hall Grendel's head.
1803,XXIII,So presently to the palace there
1804,XXIII,"foemen fearless, fourteen Geats,"
1805,XXIII,marching came. Their master-of-clan
1806,XXIII,mighty amid them the meadow-ways trod.
1807,XXIII,Strode then within the sovran thane
1808,XXIII,"fearless in fight, of fame renowned,"
1809,XXIII,"hardy hero, Hrothgar to greet."
1810,XXIII,And next by the hair into hall was borne
1811,XXIII,"Grendel's head, where the henchmen were drinking,"
1812,XXIII,"an awe to clan and queen alike,"
1813,XXIII,a monster of marvel:  the men looked on.
1814,XXIII,
1815,XXIII,
1816,XXIII,
1817,XXIV,XXIV
1818,XXIV,
1819,XXIV,"BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:  --"
1820,XXIV,"""Lo, now, this sea-booty, son of Healfdene,"
1821,XXIV,"Lord of Scyldings, we've lustily brought thee,"
1822,XXIV,sign of glory; thou seest it here.
1823,XXIV,Not lightly did I with my life escape!
1824,XXIV,In war under water this work I essayed
1825,XXIV,with endless effort; and even so
1826,XXIV,my strength had been lost had the Lord not shielded me.
1827,XXIV,Not a whit could I with Hrunting do
1828,XXIV,"in work of war, though the weapon is good;"
1829,XXIV,yet a sword the Sovran of Men vouchsafed me
1830,XXIV,"to spy on the wall there, in splendor hanging,"
1831,XXIV,"old, gigantic, -- how oft He guides"
1832,XXIV,"the friendless wight! -- and I fought with that brand,"
1833,XXIV,"felling in fight, since fate was with me,"
1834,XXIV,the house's wardens. That war-sword then
1835,XXIV,"all burned, bright blade, when the blood gushed o'er it,"
1836,XXIV,battle-sweat hot; but the hilt I brought back
1837,XXIV,from my foes. So avenged I their fiendish deeds
1838,XXIV,"death-fall of Danes, as was due and right."
1839,XXIV,"And this is my hest, that in Heorot now"
1840,XXIV,"safe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band,"
1841,XXIV,and every thane of all thy folk
1842,XXIV,"both old and young; no evil fear,"
1843,XXIV,"Scyldings' lord, from that side again,"
1844,XXIV,"aught ill for thy earls, as erst thou must!"""
1845,XXIV,"Then the golden hilt, for that gray-haired leader,"
1846,XXIV,"hoary hero, in hand was laid,"
1847,XXIV,"giant-wrought, old. So owned and enjoyed it"
1848,XXIV,"after downfall of devils, the Danish lord,"
1849,XXIV,"wonder-smiths' work, since the world was rid"
1850,XXIV,"of that grim-souled fiend, the foe of God,"
1851,XXIV,"murder-marked, and his mother as well."
1852,XXIV,"Now it passed into power of the people's king,"
1853,XXIV,best of all that the oceans bound
1854,XXIV,who have scattered their gold o'er Scandia's isle.
1855,XXIV,"Hrothgar spake -- the hilt he viewed,"
1856,XXIV,"heirloom old, where was etched the rise"
1857,XXIV,"of that far-off fight when the floods o'erwhelmed,"
1858,XXIV,"raging waves, the race of giants"
1859,XXIV,"(fearful their fate!), a folk estranged"
1860,XXIV,from God Eternal:  whence guerdon due
1861,XXIV,in that waste of waters the Wielder paid them.
1862,XXIV,So on the guard of shining gold
1863,XXIV,in runic staves it was rightly said
1864,XXIV,"for whom the serpent-traced sword was wrought,"
1865,XXIV,"best of blades, in bygone days,"
1866,XXIV,"and the hilt well wound. -- The wise-one spake,"
1867,XXIV,son of Healfdene; silent were all:  --
1868,XXIV,"""Lo, so may he say who sooth and right"
1869,XXIV,"follows 'mid folk, of far times mindful,"
1870,XXIV,"a land-warden old, {24a} that this earl belongs"
1871,XXIV,"to the better breed! So, borne aloft,"
1872,XXIV,"thy fame must fly, O friend my Beowulf,"
1873,XXIV,far and wide o'er folksteads many. Firmly thou
1874,XXIV,"shalt all maintain,"
1875,XXIV,mighty strength with mood of wisdom. Love of
1876,XXIV,"mine will I assure thee,"
1877,XXIV,"as, awhile ago, I promised; thou shalt prove a stay"
1878,XXIV,"in future,"
1879,XXIV,"in far-off years, to folk of thine,"
1880,XXIV,to the heroes a help. Was not Heremod thus
1881,XXIV,"to offspring of Ecgwela, Honor-Scyldings,"
1882,XXIV,"nor grew for their grace, but for grisly slaughter,"
1883,XXIV,for doom of death to the Danishmen.
1884,XXIV,
1885,XXIV,"He slew, wrath-swollen, his shoulder-comrades,"
1886,XXIV,"companions at board! So he passed alone,"
1887,XXIV,"chieftain haughty, from human cheer."
1888,XXIV,"Though him the Maker with might endowed,"
1889,XXIV,"delights of power, and uplifted high"
1890,XXIV,"above all men, yet blood-fierce his mind,"
1891,XXIV,"his breast-hoard, grew, no bracelets gave he"
1892,XXIV,to Danes as was due; he endured all joyless
1893,XXIV,"strain of struggle and stress of woe,"
1894,XXIV,long feud with his folk. Here find thy lesson!
1895,XXIV,"Of virtue advise thee! This verse I have said for thee,"
1896,XXIV,wise from lapsed winters. Wondrous seems
1897,XXIV,how to sons of men Almighty God
1898,XXIV,"in the strength of His spirit sendeth wisdom,"
1899,XXIV,"estate, high station:  He swayeth all things."
1900,XXIV,Whiles He letteth right lustily fare
1901,XXIV,"the heart of the hero of high-born race, --"
1902,XXIV,"in seat ancestral assigns him bliss,"
1903,XXIV,"his folk's sure fortress in fee to hold,"
1904,XXIV,"puts in his power great parts of the earth,"
1905,XXIV,"empire so ample, that end of it"
1906,XXIV,this wanter-of-wisdom weeneth none.
1907,XXIV,"So he waxes in wealth, nowise can harm him"
1908,XXIV,illness or age; no evil cares
1909,XXIV,shadow his spirit; no sword-hate threatens
1910,XXIV,from ever an enemy:  all the world
1911,XXIV,"wends at his will, no worse he knoweth,"
1912,XXIV,till all within him obstinate pride
1913,XXIV,"waxes and wakes while the warden slumbers,"
1914,XXIV,the spirit's sentry; sleep is too fast
1915,XXIV,"which masters his might, and the murderer nears,"
1916,XXIV,stealthily shooting the shafts from his bow!
1917,XXIV,
1918,XXIV,
1919,XXIV,
1920,XXV,XXV
1921,XXV,
1922,XXV,"""UNDER harness his heart then is hit indeed"
1923,XXV,by sharpest shafts; and no shelter avails
1924,XXV,from foul behest of the hellish fiend. {25a}
1925,XXV,Him seems too little what long he possessed.
1926,XXV,"Greedy and grim, no golden rings"
1927,XXV,he gives for his pride; the promised future
1928,XXV,"forgets he and spurns, with all God has sent him,"
1929,XXV,"Wonder-Wielder, of wealth and fame."
1930,XXV,Yet in the end it ever comes
1931,XXV,"that the frame of the body fragile yields,"
1932,XXV,fated falls; and there follows another
1933,XXV,"who joyously the jewels divides,"
1934,XXV,"the royal riches, nor recks of his forebear."
1935,XXV,"Ban, then, such baleful thoughts, Beowulf dearest,"
1936,XXV,"best of men, and the better part choose,"
1937,XXV,"profit eternal; and temper thy pride,"
1938,XXV,warrior famous! The flower of thy might
1939,XXV,lasts now a while:  but erelong it shall be
1940,XXV,"that sickness or sword thy strength shall minish,"
1941,XXV,"or fang of fire, or flooding billow,"
1942,XXV,"or bite of blade, or brandished spear,"
1943,XXV,or odious age; or the eyes' clear beam
1944,XXV,wax dull and darken:  Death even thee
1945,XXV,"in haste shall o'erwhelm, thou hero of war!"
1946,XXV,"So the Ring-Danes these half-years a hundred I ruled,"
1947,XXV,"wielded 'neath welkin, and warded them bravely"
1948,XXV,"from mighty-ones many o'er middle-earth,"
1949,XXV,"from spear and sword, till it seemed for me"
1950,XXV,no foe could be found under fold of the sky.
1951,XXV,"Lo, sudden the shift! To me seated secure"
1952,XXV,came grief for joy when Grendel began
1953,XXV,"to harry my home, the hellish foe;"
1954,XXV,"for those ruthless raids, unresting I suffered"
1955,XXV,"heart-sorrow heavy. Heaven be thanked,"
1956,XXV,"Lord Eternal, for life extended"
1957,XXV,"that I on this head all hewn and bloody,"
1958,XXV,"after long evil, with eyes may gaze!"
1959,XXV,"-- Go to the bench now! Be glad at banquet,"
1960,XXV,warrior worthy! A wealth of treasure
1961,XXV,"at dawn of day, be dealt between us!"""
1962,XXV,"Glad was the Geats' lord, going betimes"
1963,XXV,"to seek his seat, as the Sage commanded."
1964,XXV,"Afresh, as before, for the famed-in-battle,"
1965,XXV,"for the band of the hall, was a banquet dight"
1966,XXV,nobly anew. The Night-Helm darkened
1967,XXV,dusk o'er the drinkers.
1968,XXV,The doughty ones rose:
1969,XXV,"for the hoary-headed would hasten to rest,"
1970,XXV,"aged Scylding; and eager the Geat,"
1971,XXV,"shield-fighter sturdy, for sleeping yearned."
1972,XXV,"Him wander-weary, warrior-guest"
1973,XXV,"from far, a hall-thane heralded forth,"
1974,XXV,who by custom courtly cared for all
1975,XXV,needs of a thane as in those old days
1976,XXV,warrior-wanderers wont to have.
1977,XXV,So slumbered the stout-heart. Stately the hall
1978,XXV,rose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on
1979,XXV,till a raven black the rapture-of-heaven {25b}
1980,XXV,blithe-heart boded. Bright came flying
1981,XXV,"shine after shadow. The swordsmen hastened,"
1982,XXV,athelings all were eager homeward
1983,XXV,forth to fare; and far from thence
1984,XXV,the great-hearted guest would guide his keel.
1985,XXV,Bade then the hardy-one Hrunting be brought
1986,XXV,"to the son of Ecglaf, the sword bade him take,"
1987,XXV,"excellent iron, and uttered his thanks for it,"
1988,XXV,"quoth that he counted it keen in battle,"
1989,XXV,"""war-friend"" winsome:  with words he slandered not"
1990,XXV,edge of the blade:  'twas a big-hearted man!
1991,XXV,Now eager for parting and armed at point
1992,XXV,"warriors waited, while went to his host"
1993,XXV,that Darling of Danes. The doughty atheling
1994,XXV,to high-seat hastened and Hrothgar greeted.

1999,XXVI,
2000,XXVI,"BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:  --"
2001,XXVI,"""Lo, we seafarers say our will,"
2002,XXVI,"far-come men, that we fain would seek"
2003,XXVI,Hygelac now. We here have found
2004,XXVI,hosts to our heart:  thou hast harbored us well.
2005,XXVI,If ever on earth I am able to win me
2006,XXVI,"more of thy love, O lord of men,"
2007,XXVI,"aught anew, than I now have done,"
2008,XXVI,for work of war I am willing still!
2009,XXVI,If it come to me ever across the seas
2010,XXVI,"that neighbor foemen annoy and fright thee, --"
2011,XXVI,"as they that hate thee erewhile have used, --"
2012,XXVI,"thousands then of thanes I shall bring,"
2013,XXVI,"heroes to help thee. Of Hygelac I know,"
2014,XXVI,"ward of his folk, that, though few his years,"
2015,XXVI,the lord of the Geats will give me aid
2016,XXVI,"by word and by work, that well I may serve thee,"
2017,XXVI,wielding the war-wood to win thy triumph
2018,XXVI,and lending thee might when thou lackest men.
2019,XXVI,"If thy Hrethric should come to court of Geats,"
2020,XXVI,"a sovran's son, he will surely there"
2021,XXVI,find his friends. A far-off land
2022,XXVI,"each man should visit who vaunts him brave."""
2023,XXVI,"Him then answering, Hrothgar spake:  --"
2024,XXVI,"""These words of thine the wisest God"
2025,XXVI,sent to thy soul! No sager counsel
2026,XXVI,from so young in years e'er yet have I heard.
2027,XXVI,"Thou art strong of main and in mind art wary,"
2028,XXVI,art wise in words! I ween indeed
2029,XXVI,if ever it hap that Hrethel's heir
2030,XXVI,"by spear be seized, by sword-grim battle,"

2033,XXVI,no seemlier man will the Sea-Geats find
2034,XXVI,"at all to choose for their chief and king,"
2035,XXVI,"for hoard-guard of heroes, if hold thou wilt"
2036,XXVI,thy kinsman's kingdom! Thy keen mind pleases me
2037,XXVI,"the longer the better, Beowulf loved!"
2038,XXVI,
2039,XXVI,"Thou hast brought it about that both our peoples,"
2040,XXVI,"sons of the Geat and Spear-Dane folk,"
2041,XXVI,"shall have mutual peace, and from murderous strife,"

2049,XXVI,"and honor they keep in the olden way."""
2050,XXVI,"To him in the hall, then, Healfdene's son"
2051,XXVI,"gave treasures twelve, and the trust-of-earls"
2052,XXVI,"bade him fare with the gifts to his folk beloved,"
2053,XXVI,"hale to his home, and in haste return."
2054,XXVI,"Then kissed the king of kin renowned,"
2055,XXVI,"Scyldings' chieftain, that choicest thane,"
2056,XXVI,and fell on his neck. Fast flowed the tears
2057,XXVI,"of the hoary-headed. Heavy with winters,"
2058,XXVI,"he had chances twain, but he clung to this, {26a} --"
2059,XXVI,"that each should look on the other again,"
2060,XXVI,and hear him in hall. Was this hero so dear to him.
2061,XXVI,his breast's wild billows he banned in vain;
2062,XXVI,"safe in his soul a secret longing,"
2063,XXVI,"locked in his mind, for that loved man"

2080,XXVII,"trusty as ever, the earl's return."
2081,XXVII,From the height of the hill no hostile words
2082,XXVII,reached the guests as he rode to greet them;
2083,XXVII,"but ""Welcome!"" he called to that Weder clan"
2084,XXVII,as the sheen-mailed spoilers to ship marched on.
2085,XXVII,"Then on the strand, with steeds and treasure"

2094,XXVII,"A sea-cloth was set, a sail with ropes,"
2095,XXVII,firm to the mast; the flood-timbers moaned; {27a}
2096,XXVII,nor did wind over billows that wave-swimmer blow
2097,XXVII,"across from her course. The craft sped on,"
2098,XXVII,"foam-necked it floated forth o'er the waves,"
2099,XXVII,"keel firm-bound over briny currents,"
2100,XXVII,"till they got them sight of the Geatish cliffs,"
2101,XXVII,"home-known headlands. High the boat,"
2102,XXVII,"stirred by winds, on the strand updrove."
2103,XXVII,"Helpful at haven the harbor-guard stood,"
2104,XXVII,who long already for loved companions
2105,XXVII,by the water had waited and watched afar.
2106,XXVII,He bound to the beach the broad-bosomed ship
2107,XXVII,"with anchor-bands, lest ocean-billows"
2108,XXVII,that trusty timber should tear away.
2109,XXVII,"Then Beowulf bade them bear the treasure,"
2110,XXVII,gold and jewels; no journey far
2111,XXVII,"was it thence to go to the giver of rings,"
2112,XXVII,Hygelac Hrethling:  at home he dwelt
2113,XXVII,"by the sea-wall close, himself and clan."
2114,XXVII,"Haughty that house, a hero the king,"
2115,XXVII,"high the hall, and Hygd {27b} right young,"
2116,XXVII,"wise and wary, though winters few"
2117,XXVII,"in those fortress walls she had found a home,"
2118,XXVII,"Haereth's daughter. Nor humble her ways,"
2119,XXVII,"nor grudged she gifts to the Geatish men,"
2120,XXVII,"of precious treasure. Not Thryth's pride showed she,"
2121,XXVII,"folk-queen famed, or that fell deceit."
2122,XXVII,Was none so daring that durst make bold
2123,XXVII,(save her lord alone) of the liegemen dear
2124,XXVII,"that lady full in the face to look,"
2125,XXVII,"but forged fetters he found his lot,"
2126,XXVII,bonds of death! And brief the respite;
2127,XXVII,"soon as they seized him, his sword-doom was spoken,"
2128,XXVII,and the burnished blade a baleful murder
2129,XXVII,proclaimed and closed. No queenly way
2130,XXVII,"for woman to practise, though peerless she,"
2131,XXVII,that the weaver-of-peace {27c} from warrior dear
2132,XXVII,by wrath and lying his life should reave!
2133,XXVII,But Hemming's kinsman hindered this. --
2134,XXVII,For over their ale men also told
2135,XXVII,"that of these folk-horrors fewer she wrought,"
2136,XXVII,"onslaughts of evil, after she went,"
2137,XXVII,"gold-decked bride, to the brave young prince,"
2138,XXVII,"atheling haughty, and Offa's hall"
2139,XXVII,o'er the fallow flood at her father's bidding
2140,XXVII,"safely sought, where since she prospered,"
2141,XXVII,"royal, throned, rich in goods,"
2142,XXVII,"fain of the fair life fate had sent her,"
2143,XXVII,and leal in love to the lord of warriors.
2144,XXVII,"He, of all heroes I heard of ever"
2145,XXVII,"from sea to sea, of the sons of earth,"
2146,XXVII,most excellent seemed. Hence Offa was praised
2147,XXVII,"for his fighting and feeing by far-off men,"
2148,XXVII,the spear-bold warrior; wisely he ruled
2149,XXVII,"over his empire. Eomer woke to him,"
2150,XXVII,"help of heroes, Hemming's kinsman,"
2151,XXVII,"Grandson of Garmund, grim in war."
2152,XXVII,
2153,XXVII,
2154,XXVII,
2155,XXVIII,XXVIII
2156,XXVIII,
2157,XXVIII,"HASTENED the hardy one, henchmen with him,"
2158,XXVIII,sandy strand of the sea to tread
2159,XXVIII,"and widespread ways. The world's great candle,"
2160,XXVIII,sun shone from south. They strode along
2161,XXVIII,with sturdy steps to the spot they knew
2162,XXVIII,"where the battle-king young, his burg within,"
2163,XXVIII,"slayer of Ongentheow, shared the rings,"
2164,XXVIII,shelter-of-heroes. To Hygelac
2165,XXVIII,"Beowulf's coming was quickly told, --"
2166,XXVIII,"that there in the court the clansmen's refuge,"
2167,XXVIII,"the shield-companion sound and alive,"
2168,XXVIII,hale from the hero-play homeward strode.
2169,XXVIII,"With haste in the hall, by highest order,"
2170,XXVIII,room for the rovers was readily made.
2171,XXVIII,"By his sovran he sat, come safe from battle,"
2172,XXVIII,kinsman by kinsman. His kindly lord
2173,XXVIII,"he first had greeted in gracious form,"
2174,XXVIII,"with manly words. The mead dispensing,"
2175,XXVIII,"came through the high hall Haereth's daughter,"
2176,XXVIII,"winsome to warriors, wine-cup bore"
2177,XXVIII,to the hands of the heroes. Hygelac then
2178,XXVIII,his comrade fairly with question plied
2179,XXVIII,"in the lofty hall, sore longing to know"
2180,XXVIII,what manner of sojourn the Sea-Geats made.
2181,XXVIII,"""What came of thy quest, my kinsman Beowulf,"
2182,XXVIII,when thy yearnings suddenly swept thee yonder
2183,XXVIII,"battle to seek o'er the briny sea,"
2184,XXVIII,combat in Heorot? Hrothgar couldst thou
2185,XXVIII,"aid at all, the honored chief,"
2186,XXVIII,in his wide-known woes? With waves of care
2187,XXVIII,my sad heart seethed; I sore mistrusted
2188,XXVIII,my loved one's venture:  long I begged thee
2189,XXVIII,"by no means to seek that slaughtering monster,"
2190,XXVIII,but suffer the South-Danes to settle their feud
2191,XXVIII,themselves with Grendel. Now God be thanked
2192,XXVIII,"that safe and sound I can see thee now!"""
2193,XXVIII,"Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow:  --"
2194,XXVIII,"""'Tis known and unhidden, Hygelac Lord,"
2195,XXVIII,"to many men, that meeting of ours,"
2196,XXVIII,"struggle grim between Grendel and me,"
2197,XXVIII,which we fought on the field where full too many
2198,XXVIII,"sorrows he wrought for the Scylding-Victors,"
2199,XXVIII,evils unending. These all I avenged.
2200,XXVIII,"No boast can be from breed of Grendel,"
2201,XXVIII,"any on earth, for that uproar at dawn,"
2202,XXVIII,from the longest-lived of the loathsome race
2203,XXVIII,in fleshly fold! -- But first I went
2204,XXVIII,"Hrothgar to greet in the hall of gifts,"
2205,XXVIII,"where Healfdene's kinsman high-renowned,"
2206,XXVIII,"soon as my purpose was plain to him,"
2207,XXVIII,assigned me a seat by his son and heir.
2208,XXVIII,The liegemen were lusty; my life-days never
2209,XXVIII,such merry men over mead in hall
2210,XXVIII,"have I heard under heaven! The high-born queen,"
2211,XXVIII,"people's peace-bringer, passed through the hall,"
2212,XXVIII,"cheered the young clansmen, clasps of gold,"
2213,XXVIII,"ere she sought her seat, to sundry gave."
2214,XXVIII,"Oft to the heroes Hrothgar's daughter,"
2215,XXVIII,"to earls in turn, the ale-cup tendered, --"
2216,XXVIII,she whom I heard these hall-companions
2217,XXVIII,"Freawaru name, when fretted gold"
2218,XXVIII,"she proffered the warriors. Promised is she,"
2219,XXVIII,"gold-decked maid, to the glad son of Froda."
2220,XXVIII,"Sage this seems to the Scylding's-friend,"
2221,XXVIII,kingdom's-keeper:  he counts it wise
2222,XXVIII,"the woman to wed so and ward off feud,"
2223,XXVIII,store of slaughter. But seldom ever
2224,XXVIII,"when men are slain, does the murder-spear sink"
2225,XXVIII,"but briefest while, though the bride be fair! {28a}"
2226,XXVIII,"""Nor haply will like it the Heathobard lord,"
2227,XXVIII,"and as little each of his liegemen all,"
2228,XXVIII,"when a thane of the Danes, in that doughty throng,"
2229,XXVIII,"goes with the lady along their hall,"
2230,XXVIII,and on him the old-time heirlooms glisten
2231,XXVIII,"hard and ring-decked, Heathobard's treasure,"
2232,XXVIII,weapons that once they wielded fair
2233,XXVIII,until they lost at the linden-play {28b}
2234,XXVIII,liegeman leal and their lives as well.
2235,XXVIII,"Then, over the ale, on this heirloom gazing,"
2236,XXVIII,some ash-wielder old who has all in mind
2237,XXVIII,"that spear-death of men, {28c} -- he is stern of mood,"
2238,XXVIII,"heavy at heart, -- in the hero young"
2239,XXVIII,tests the temper and tries the soul
2240,XXVIII,"and war-hate wakens, with words like these:  --"
2241,XXVIII,"Canst thou not, comrade, ken that sword"
2242,XXVIII,which to the fray thy father carried
2243,XXVIII,"in his final feud, 'neath the fighting-mask,"
2244,XXVIII,"dearest of blades, when the Danish slew him"
2245,XXVIII,"and wielded the war-place on Withergild's fall,"
2246,XXVIII,"after havoc of heroes, those hardy Scyldings?"
2247,XXVIII,"Now, the son of a certain slaughtering Dane,"
2248,XXVIII,"proud of his treasure, paces this hall,"
2249,XXVIII,"joys in the killing, and carries the jewel {28d}"
2250,XXVIII,that rightfully ought to be owned by thee!_
2251,XXVIII,Thus he urges and eggs him all the time
2252,XXVIII,"with keenest words, till occasion offers"
2253,XXVIII,"that Freawaru's thane, for his father's deed,"
2254,XXVIII,"after bite of brand in his blood must slumber,"
2255,XXVIII,losing his life; but that liegeman flies
2256,XXVIII,"living away, for the land he kens."
2257,XXVIII,And thus be broken on both their sides
2258,XXVIII,"oaths of the earls, when Ingeld's breast"
2259,XXVIII,"wells with war-hate, and wife-love now"
2260,XXVIII,after the care-billows cooler grows.
2261,XXVIII,"""So {28e} I hold not high the Heathobards' faith"
2262,XXVIII,"due to the Danes, or their during love"
2263,XXVIII,"and pact of peace. -- But I pass from that,"
2264,XXVIII,"turning to Grendel, O giver-of-treasure,"
2265,XXVIII,"and saying in full how the fight resulted,"
2266,XXVIII,hand-fray of heroes. When heaven's jewel
2267,XXVIII,"had fled o'er far fields, that fierce sprite came,"
2268,XXVIII,"night-foe savage, to seek us out"
2269,XXVIII,where safe and sound we sentried the hall.
2270,XXVIII,"To Hondscio then was that harassing deadly,"
2271,XXVIII,"his fall there was fated. He first was slain,"
2272,XXVIII,girded warrior. Grendel on him
2273,XXVIII,"turned murderous mouth, on our mighty kinsman,"
2274,XXVIII,and all of the brave man's body devoured.
2275,XXVIII,"Yet none the earlier, empty-handed,"
2276,XXVIII,"would the bloody-toothed murderer, mindful of bale,"
2277,XXVIII,outward go from the gold-decked hall:
2278,XXVIII,"but me he attacked in his terror of might,"
2279,XXVIII,with greedy hand grasped me. A glove hung by him {28f}
2280,XXVIII,"wide and wondrous, wound with bands;"
2281,XXVIII,"and in artful wise it all was wrought,"
2282,XXVIII,"by devilish craft, of dragon-skins."
2283,XXVIII,"Me therein, an innocent man,"
2284,XXVIII,the fiendish foe was fain to thrust
2285,XXVIII,"with many another. He might not so,"
2286,XXVIII,when I all angrily upright stood.
2287,XXVIII,'Twere long to relate how that land-destroyer
2288,XXVIII,I paid in kind for his cruel deeds;
2289,XXVIII,"yet there, my prince, this people of thine"
2290,XXVIII,"got fame by my fighting. He fled away,"
2291,XXVIII,and a little space his life preserved;
2292,XXVIII,but there staid behind him his stronger hand
2293,XXVIII,left in Heorot; heartsick thence
2294,XXVIII,on the floor of the ocean that outcast fell.
2295,XXVIII,Me for this struggle the Scyldings'-friend
2296,XXVIII,"paid in plenty with plates of gold,"
2297,XXVIII,"with many a treasure, when morn had come"
2298,XXVIII,and we all at the banquet-board sat down.
2299,XXVIII,"Then was song and glee. The gray-haired Scylding,"
2300,XXVIII,"much tested, told of the times of yore."
2301,XXVIII,"Whiles the hero his harp bestirred,"
2302,XXVIII,wood-of-delight; now lays he chanted
2303,XXVIII,"of sooth and sadness, or said aright"
2304,XXVIII,"legends of wonder, the wide-hearted king;"
2305,XXVIII,"or for years of his youth he would yearn at times,"
2306,XXVIII,"for strength of old struggles, now stricken with age,"
2307,XXVIII,hoary hero:  his heart surged full
2308,XXVIII,"when, wise with winters, he wailed their flight."
2309,XXVIII,Thus in the hall the whole of that day
2310,XXVIII,"at ease we feasted, till fell o'er earth"
2311,XXVIII,another night. Anon full ready
2312,XXVIII,"in greed of vengeance, Grendel's mother"
2313,XXVIII,set forth all doleful. Dead was her son
2314,XXVIII,"through war-hate of Weders; now, woman monstrous"
2315,XXVIII,"with fury fell a foeman she slew,"
2316,XXVIII,"avenged her offspring. From Aeschere old,"
2317,XXVIII,"loyal councillor, life was gone;"
2318,XXVIII,"nor might they e'en, when morning broke,"
2319,XXVIII,"those Danish people, their death-done comrade"
2320,XXVIII,"burn with brands, on balefire lay"
2321,XXVIII,the man they mourned. Under mountain stream
2322,XXVIII,she had carried the corpse with cruel hands.
2323,XXVIII,For Hrothgar that was the heaviest sorrow
2324,XXVIII,of all that had laden the lord of his folk.
2325,XXVIII,"The leader then, by thy life, besought me"
2326,XXVIII,(sad was his soul) in the sea-waves' coil
2327,XXVIII,to play the hero and hazard my being
2328,XXVIII,for glory of prowess:  my guerdon he pledged.
2329,XXVIII,I then in the waters -- 'tis widely known --
2330,XXVIII,that sea-floor-guardian savage found.
2331,XXVIII,Hand-to-hand there a while we struggled;
2332,XXVIII,billows welled blood; in the briny hall
2333,XXVIII,her head I hewed with a hardy blade
2334,XXVIII,"from Grendel's mother, -- and gained my life,"
2335,XXVIII,though not without danger. My doom was not yet.
2336,XXVIII,"Then the haven-of-heroes, Healfdene's son,"
2337,XXVIII,gave me in guerdon great gifts of price.
2338,XXVIII,
2339,XXVIII,
2340,XXVIII,
2341,XXIX,XXIX
2342,XXIX,
2343,XXIX,"""So held this king to the customs old,"
2344,XXIX,"that I wanted for nought in the wage I gained,"
2345,XXIX,"the meed of my might; he made me gifts,"
2346,XXIX,"Healfdene's heir, for my own disposal."
2347,XXIX,"Now to thee, my prince, I proffer them all,"
2348,XXIX,gladly give them. Thy grace alone
2349,XXIX,can find me favor. Few indeed
2350,XXIX,"have I of kinsmen, save, Hygelac, thee!"""
2351,XXIX,"Then he bade them bear him the boar-head standard,"
2352,XXIX,"the battle-helm high, and breastplate gray,"
2353,XXIX,the splendid sword; then spake in form:  --
2354,XXIX,"""Me this war-gear the wise old prince,"
2355,XXIX,"Hrothgar, gave, and his hest he added,"
2356,XXIX,that its story be straightway said to thee. --
2357,XXIX,"A while it was held by Heorogar king,"
2358,XXIX,for long time lord of the land of Scyldings;
2359,XXIX,"yet not to his son the sovran left it,"
2360,XXIX,"to daring Heoroweard, -- dear as he was to him,"
2361,XXIX,"his harness of battle. -- Well hold thou it all!"""
2362,XXIX,"And I heard that soon passed o'er the path of this treasure,"
2363,XXIX,"all apple-fallow, four good steeds,"
2364,XXIX,"each like the others, arms and horses"
2365,XXIX,"he gave to the king. So should kinsmen be,"
2366,XXIX,"not weave one another the net of wiles,"
2367,XXIX,or with deep-hid treachery death contrive
2368,XXIX,for neighbor and comrade. His nephew was ever
2369,XXIX,"by hardy Hygelac held full dear,"
2370,XXIX,and each kept watch o'er the other's weal.
2371,XXIX,"I heard, too, the necklace to Hygd he presented,"
2372,XXIX,"wonder-wrought treasure, which Wealhtheow gave him"
2373,XXIX,"sovran's daughter:  three steeds he added,"
2374,XXIX,slender and saddle-gay. Since such gift
2375,XXIX,the gem gleamed bright on the breast of the queen.
2376,XXIX,Thus showed his strain the son of Ecgtheow
2377,XXIX,as a man remarked for mighty deeds
2378,XXIX,and acts of honor. At ale he slew not
2379,XXIX,"comrade or kin; nor cruel his mood,"
2380,XXIX,"though of sons of earth his strength was greatest,"
2381,XXIX,a glorious gift that God had sent
2382,XXIX,"the splendid leader. Long was he spurned,"
2383,XXIX,and worthless by Geatish warriors held;
2384,XXIX,him at mead the master-of-clans
2385,XXIX,failed full oft to favor at all.
2386,XXIX,"Slack and shiftless the strong men deemed him,"
2387,XXIX,"profitless prince; but payment came,"
2388,XXIX,"to the warrior honored, for all his woes. --"
2389,XXIX,"Then the bulwark-of-earls {29a} bade bring within,"
2390,XXIX,"hardy chieftain, Hrethel's heirloom"
2391,XXIX,garnished with gold:  no Geat e'er knew
2392,XXIX,in shape of a sword a statelier prize.
2393,XXIX,The brand he laid in Beowulf's lap;
2394,XXIX,"and of hides assigned him seven thousand, {29b}"
2395,XXIX,with house and high-seat. They held in common
2396,XXIX,"land alike by their line of birth,"
2397,XXIX,"inheritance, home:  but higher the king"
2398,XXIX,because of his rule o'er the realm itself.
2399,XXIX,
2400,XXIX,"Now further it fell with the flight of years,"
2401,XXIX,"with harryings horrid, that Hygelac perished, {29c}"
2402,XXIX,"and Heardred, too, by hewing of swords"
2403,XXIX,"under the shield-wall slaughtered lay,"
2404,XXIX,when him at the van of his victor-folk
2405,XXIX,"sought hardy heroes, Heatho-Scilfings,"
2406,XXIX,in arms o'erwhelming Hereric's nephew.
2407,XXIX,Then Beowulf came as king this broad
2408,XXIX,realm to wield; and he ruled it well
2409,XXIX,"fifty winters, {29d} a wise old prince,"
2410,XXIX,"warding his land, until One began"
2411,XXIX,"in the dark of night, a Dragon, to rage."
2412,XXIX,"In the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded,"
2413,XXIX,"in the stone-barrow steep. A strait path reached it,"
2414,XXIX,"unknown to mortals. Some man, however,"
2415,XXIX,came by chance that cave within
2416,XXIX,to the heathen hoard. {29e} In hand he took
2417,XXIX,"a golden goblet, nor gave he it back,"
2418,XXIX,"stole with it away, while the watcher slept,"
2419,XXIX,by thievish wiles:  for the warden's wrath
2420,XXIX,prince and people must pay betimes!
2421,XXIX,
2422,XXIX,
2423,XXIX,
2424,XXX,XXX
2425,XXX,
2426,XXX,"THAT way he went with no will of his own,"
2427,XXX,"in danger of life, to the dragon's hoard,"
2428,XXX,"but for pressure of peril, some prince's thane."
2429,XXX,"He fled in fear the fatal scourge,"
2430,XXX,"seeking shelter, a sinful man,"
2431,XXX,and entered in. At the awful sight
2432,XXX,"tottered that guest, and terror seized him;"
2433,XXX,yet the wretched fugitive rallied anon
2434,XXX,"from fright and fear ere he fled away,"
2435,XXX,and took the cup from that treasure-hoard.
2436,XXX,"Of such besides there was store enough,"
2437,XXX,"heirlooms old, the earth below,"
2438,XXX,"which some earl forgotten, in ancient years,"
2439,XXX,"left the last of his lofty race,"
2440,XXX,"heedfully there had hidden away,"
2441,XXX,dearest treasure. For death of yore
2442,XXX,had hurried all hence; and he alone
2443,XXX,"left to live, the last of the clan,"
2444,XXX,"weeping his friends, yet wished to bide"
2445,XXX,"warding the treasure, his one delight,"
2446,XXX,"though brief his respite. The barrow, new-ready,"
2447,XXX,"to strand and sea-waves stood anear,"
2448,XXX,"hard by the headland, hidden and closed;"
2449,XXX,there laid within it his lordly heirlooms
2450,XXX,and heaped hoard of heavy gold
2451,XXX,that warden of rings. Few words he spake:
2452,XXX,"""Now hold thou, earth, since heroes may not,"
2453,XXX,"what earls have owned! Lo, erst from thee"
2454,XXX,brave men brought it! But battle-death seized
2455,XXX,"and cruel killing my clansmen all,"
2456,XXX,robbed them of life and a liegeman's joys.
2457,XXX,"None have I left to lift the sword,"
2458,XXX,"or to cleanse the carven cup of price,"
2459,XXX,beaker bright. My brave are gone.
2460,XXX,"And the helmet hard, all haughty with gold,"
2461,XXX,shall part from its plating. Polishers sleep
2462,XXX,who could brighten and burnish the battle-mask;
2463,XXX,and those weeds of war that were wont to brave
2464,XXX,over bicker of shields the bite of steel
2465,XXX,rust with their bearer. The ringed mail
2466,XXX,"fares not far with famous chieftain,"
2467,XXX,"at side of hero! No harp's delight,"
2468,XXX,no glee-wood's gladness! No good hawk now
2469,XXX,flies through the hall! Nor horses fleet
2470,XXX,stamp in the burgstead! Battle and death
2471,XXX,"the flower of my race have reft away."""
2472,XXX,"Mournful of mood, thus he moaned his woe,"
2473,XXX,"alone, for them all, and unblithe wept"
2474,XXX,"by day and by night, till death's fell wave"
2475,XXX,o'erwhelmed his heart. His hoard-of-bliss
2476,XXX,"that old ill-doer open found,"
2477,XXX,"who, blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth,"
2478,XXX,naked foe-dragon flying by night
2479,XXX,folded in fire:  the folk of earth
2480,XXX,dread him sore. 'Tis his doom to seek
2481,XXX,"hoard in the graves, and heathen gold"
2482,XXX,"to watch, many-wintered:  nor wins he thereby!"
2483,XXX,Powerful this plague-of-the-people thus
2484,XXX,held the house of the hoard in earth
2485,XXX,three hundred winters; till One aroused
2486,XXX,"wrath in his breast, to the ruler bearing"
2487,XXX,"that costly cup, and the king implored"
2488,XXX,"for bond of peace. So the barrow was plundered,"
2489,XXX,borne off was booty. His boon was granted
2490,XXX,that wretched man; and his ruler saw
2491,XXX,first time what was fashioned in far-off days.
2492,XXX,"When the dragon awoke, new woe was kindled."
2493,XXX,O'er the stone he snuffed. The stark-heart found
2494,XXX,footprint of foe who so far had gone
2495,XXX,in his hidden craft by the creature's head. --
2496,XXX,So may the undoomed easily flee
2497,XXX,"evils and exile, if only he gain"
2498,XXX,the grace of The Wielder! -- That warden of gold
2499,XXX,"o'er the ground went seeking, greedy to find"
2500,XXX,the man who wrought him such wrong in sleep.
2501,XXX,"Savage and burning, the barrow he circled"
2502,XXX,"all without; nor was any there,"
2503,XXX,"none in the waste.... Yet war he desired,"
2504,XXX,"was eager for battle. The barrow he entered,"
2505,XXX,"sought the cup, and discovered soon"
2506,XXX,"that some one of mortals had searched his treasure,"
2507,XXX,his lordly gold. The guardian waited
2508,XXX,ill-enduring till evening came;
2509,XXX,"boiling with wrath was the barrow's keeper,"
2510,XXX,and fain with flame the foe to pay
2511,XXX,for the dear cup's loss. -- Now day was fled
2512,XXX,as the worm had wished. By its wall no more
2513,XXX,"was it glad to bide, but burning flew"
2514,XXX,folded in flame:  a fearful beginning
2515,XXX,"for sons of the soil; and soon it came,"
2516,XXX,"in the doom of their lord, to a dreadful end."
2517,XXX,
2518,XXX,
2519,XXX,
2520,XXXI,XXXI
2521,XXXI,
2522,XXXI,"THEN the baleful fiend its fire belched out,"
2523,XXXI,and bright homes burned. The blaze stood high
2524,XXXI,all landsfolk frighting. No living thing
2525,XXXI,would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew.
2526,XXXI,"Wide was the dragon's warring seen,"
2527,XXXI,"its fiendish fury far and near,"
2528,XXXI,as the grim destroyer those Geatish people
2529,XXXI,"hated and hounded. To hidden lair,"
2530,XXXI,to its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn.
2531,XXXI,"Folk of the land it had lapped in flame,"
2532,XXXI,"with bale and brand. In its barrow it trusted,"
2533,XXXI,its battling and bulwarks:  that boast was vain!
2534,XXXI,
2535,XXXI,To Beowulf then the bale was told
2536,XXXI,"quickly and truly:  the king's own home,"
2537,XXXI,"of buildings the best, in brand-waves melted,"
2538,XXXI,that gift-throne of Geats. To the good old man
2539,XXXI,"sad in heart, 'twas heaviest sorrow."
2540,XXXI,The sage assumed that his sovran God
2541,XXXI,"he had angered, breaking ancient law,"
2542,XXXI,and embittered the Lord. His breast within
2543,XXXI,"with black thoughts welled, as his wont was never."
2544,XXXI,The folk's own fastness that fiery dragon
2545,XXXI,"with flame had destroyed, and the stronghold all"
2546,XXXI,"washed by waves; but the warlike king,"
2547,XXXI,"prince of the Weders, plotted vengeance."
2548,XXXI,"Warriors'-bulwark, he bade them work"
2549,XXXI,all of iron -- the earl's commander --
2550,XXXI,a war-shield wondrous:  well he knew
2551,XXXI,"that forest-wood against fire were worthless,"
2552,XXXI,"linden could aid not. -- Atheling brave,"
2553,XXXI,"he was fated to finish this fleeting life, {31a}"
2554,XXXI,"his days on earth, and the dragon with him,"
2555,XXXI,though long it had watched o'er the wealth of the hoard! --
2556,XXXI,"Shame he reckoned it, sharer-of-rings,"
2557,XXXI,"to follow the flyer-afar with a host,"
2558,XXXI,"a broad-flung band; nor the battle feared he,"
2559,XXXI,"nor deemed he dreadful the dragon's warring,"
2560,XXXI,its vigor and valor:  ventures desperate
2561,XXXI,"he had passed a-plenty, and perils of war,"
2562,XXXI,"contest-crash, since, conqueror proud,"
2563,XXXI,"Hrothgar's hall he had wholly purged,"
2564,XXXI,"and in grapple had killed the kin of Grendel,"
2565,XXXI,loathsome breed! Not least was that
2566,XXXI,"of hand-to-hand fights where Hygelac fell,"
2567,XXXI,"when the ruler of Geats in rush of battle,"
2568,XXXI,"lord of his folk, in the Frisian land,"
2569,XXXI,"son of Hrethel, by sword-draughts died,"
2570,XXXI,by brands down-beaten. Thence Beowulf fled
2571,XXXI,"through strength of himself and his swimming power,"
2572,XXXI,"though alone, and his arms were laden with thirty"
2573,XXXI,"coats of mail, when he came to the sea!"
2574,XXXI,Nor yet might Hetwaras {31b} haughtily boast
2575,XXXI,"their craft of contest, who carried against him"
2576,XXXI,shields to the fight:  but few escaped
2577,XXXI,from strife with the hero to seek their homes!
2578,XXXI,Then swam over ocean Ecgtheow's son
2579,XXXI,"lonely and sorrowful, seeking his land,"
2580,XXXI,"where Hygd made him offer of hoard and realm,"
2581,XXXI,"rings and royal-seat, reckoning naught"
2582,XXXI,the strength of her son to save their kingdom
2583,XXXI,"from hostile hordes, after Hygelac's death."
2584,XXXI,No sooner for this could the stricken ones
2585,XXXI,in any wise move that atheling's mind
2586,XXXI,over young Heardred's head as lord
2587,XXXI,and ruler of all the realm to be:
2588,XXXI,"yet the hero upheld him with helpful words,"
2589,XXXI,"aided in honor, till, older grown,"
2590,XXXI,he wielded the Weder-Geats. -- Wandering exiles
2591,XXXI,"sought him o'er seas, the sons of Ohtere,"
2592,XXXI,"who had spurned the sway of the Scylfings'-helmet,"
2593,XXXI,"the bravest and best that broke the rings,"
2594,XXXI,"in Swedish land, of the sea-kings' line,"
2595,XXXI,haughty hero. {31c} Hence Heardred's end.
2596,XXXI,"For shelter he gave them, sword-death came,"
2597,XXXI,"the blade's fell blow, to bairn of Hygelac;"
2598,XXXI,but the son of Ongentheow sought again
2599,XXXI,"house and home when Heardred fell,"
2600,XXXI,leaving Beowulf lord of Geats
2601,XXXI,and gift-seat's master. -- A good king he!
2602,XXXI,
2603,XXXI,
2604,XXXI,
2605,XXXII,XXXII
2606,XXXII,
2607,XXXII,THE fall of his lord he was fain to requite
2608,XXXII,in after days; and to Eadgils he proved
2609,XXXII,"friend to the friendless, and forces sent"
2610,XXXII,"over the sea to the son of Ohtere,"
2611,XXXII,weapons and warriors:  well repaid he
2612,XXXII,those care-paths cold when the king he slew. {32a}
2613,XXXII,Thus safe through struggles the son of Ecgtheow
2614,XXXII,"had passed a plenty, through perils dire,"
2615,XXXII,"with daring deeds, till this day was come"
2616,XXXII,that doomed him now with the dragon to strive.
2617,XXXII,With comrades eleven the lord of Geats
2618,XXXII,swollen in rage went seeking the dragon.
2619,XXXII,He had heard whence all the harm arose
2620,XXXII,and the killing of clansmen; that cup of price
2621,XXXII,on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder.
2622,XXXII,"In the throng was this one thirteenth man,"
2623,XXXII,"starter of all the strife and ill,"
2624,XXXII,care-laden captive; cringing thence
2625,XXXII,"forced and reluctant, he led them on"
2626,XXXII,"till he came in ken of that cavern-hall,"
2627,XXXII,"the barrow delved near billowy surges,"
2628,XXXII,flood of ocean. Within 'twas full
2629,XXXII,"of wire-gold and jewels; a jealous warden,"
2630,XXXII,"warrior trusty, the treasures held,"
2631,XXXII,lurked in his lair. Not light the task
2632,XXXII,of entrance for any of earth-born men!
2633,XXXII,"Sat on the headland the hero king,"
2634,XXXII,"spake words of hail to his hearth-companions,"
2635,XXXII,"gold-friend of Geats. All gloomy his soul,"
2636,XXXII,"wavering, death-bound. Wyrd full nigh"
2637,XXXII,"stood ready to greet the gray-haired man,"
2638,XXXII,"to seize his soul-hoard, sunder apart"
2639,XXXII,life and body. Not long would be
2640,XXXII,the warrior's spirit enwound with flesh.
2641,XXXII,"Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow:  --"
2642,XXXII,"""Through store of struggles I strove in youth,"
2643,XXXII,mighty feuds; I mind them all.
2644,XXXII,"I was seven years old when the sovran of rings,"
2645,XXXII,"friend-of-his-folk, from my father took me,"
2646,XXXII,"had me, and held me, Hrethel the king,"
2647,XXXII,"with food and fee, faithful in kinship."
2648,XXXII,"Ne'er, while I lived there, he loathlier found me,"
2649,XXXII,"bairn in the burg, than his birthright sons,"
2650,XXXII,Herebeald and Haethcyn and Hygelac mine.
2651,XXXII,"For the eldest of these, by unmeet chance,"
2652,XXXII,"by kinsman's deed, was the death-bed strewn,"
2653,XXXII,"when Haethcyn killed him with horny bow,"
2654,XXXII,"his own dear liege laid low with an arrow,"
2655,XXXII,"missed the mark and his mate shot down,"
2656,XXXII,"one brother the other, with bloody shaft."
2657,XXXII,"A feeless fight, {32b} and a fearful sin,"
2658,XXXII,"horror to Hrethel; yet, hard as it was,"
2659,XXXII,unavenged must the atheling die!
2660,XXXII,Too awful it is for an aged man
2661,XXXII,"to bide and bear, that his bairn so young"
2662,XXXII,"rides on the gallows. A rime he makes,"
2663,XXXII,sorrow-song for his son there hanging
2664,XXXII,as rapture of ravens; no rescue now
2665,XXXII,"can come from the old, disabled man!"
2666,XXXII,"Still is he minded, as morning breaks,"
2667,XXXII,of the heir gone elsewhere; {32c} another he hopes not
2668,XXXII,he will bide to see his burg within
2669,XXXII,"as ward for his wealth, now the one has found"
2670,XXXII,doom of death that the deed incurred.
2671,XXXII,"Forlorn he looks on the lodge of his son,"
2672,XXXII,wine-hall waste and wind-swept chambers
2673,XXXII,"reft of revel. The rider sleepeth,"
2674,XXXII,"the hero, far-hidden; {32d} no harp resounds,"
2675,XXXII,"in the courts no wassail, as once was heard."
2676,XXXII,
2677,XXXII,
2678,XXXII,
2679,XXXIII,XXXIII
2680,XXXIII,
2681,XXXIII,"""THEN he goes to his chamber, a grief-song chants"
2682,XXXIII,"alone for his lost. Too large all seems,"
2683,XXXIII,homestead and house. So the helmet-of-Weders
2684,XXXIII,hid in his heart for Herebeald
2685,XXXIII,waves of woe. No way could he take
2686,XXXIII,to avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul;
2687,XXXIII,nor e'en could he harass that hero at all
2688,XXXIII,"with loathing deed, though he loved him not."
2689,XXXIII,"And so for the sorrow his soul endured,"
2690,XXXIII,men's gladness he gave up and God's light chose.
2691,XXXIII,Lands and cities he left his sons
2692,XXXIII,(as the wealthy do) when he went from earth.
2693,XXXIII,There was strife and struggle 'twixt Swede and Geat
2694,XXXIII,"o'er the width of waters; war arose,"
2695,XXXIII,"hard battle-horror, when Hrethel died,"
2696,XXXIII,and Ongentheow's offspring grew
2697,XXXIII,"strife-keen, bold, nor brooked o'er the seas"
2698,XXXIII,"pact of peace, but pushed their hosts"
2699,XXXIII,to harass in hatred by Hreosnabeorh.
2700,XXXIII,"Men of my folk for that feud had vengeance,"
2701,XXXIII,"for woful war ('tis widely known),"
2702,XXXIII,"though one of them bought it with blood of his heart,"
2703,XXXIII,a bargain hard:  for Haethcyn proved
2704,XXXIII,"fatal that fray, for the first-of-Geats."
2705,XXXIII,"At morn, I heard, was the murderer killed"
2706,XXXIII,"by kinsman for kinsman, {33a} with clash of sword,"
2707,XXXIII,when Ongentheow met Eofor there.
2708,XXXIII,"Wide split the war-helm:  wan he fell,"
2709,XXXIII,hoary Scylfing; the hand that smote him
2710,XXXIII,"of feud was mindful, nor flinched from the death-blow."
2711,XXXIII,"-- ""For all that he {33b} gave me, my gleaming sword"
2712,XXXIII,"repaid him at war, -- such power I wielded, --"
2713,XXXIII,"for lordly treasure:  with land he entrusted me,"
2714,XXXIII,homestead and house. He had no need
2715,XXXIII,"from Swedish realm, or from Spear-Dane folk,"
2716,XXXIII,"or from men of the Gifths, to get him help, --"
2717,XXXIII,some warrior worse for wage to buy!
2718,XXXIII,"Ever I fought in the front of all,"
2719,XXXIII,sole to the fore; and so shall I fight
2720,XXXIII,while I bide in life and this blade shall last
2721,XXXIII,that early and late hath loyal proved
2722,XXXIII,"since for my doughtiness Daeghrefn fell,"
2723,XXXIII,"slain by my hand, the Hugas' champion."
2724,XXXIII,Nor fared he thence to the Frisian king
2725,XXXIII,"with the booty back, and breast-adornments;"
2726,XXXIII,"but, slain in struggle, that standard-bearer"
2727,XXXIII,"fell, atheling brave. Not with blade was he slain,"
2728,XXXIII,"but his bones were broken by brawny gripe,"
2729,XXXIII,"his heart-waves stilled. -- The sword-edge now,"
2730,XXXIII,"hard blade and my hand, for the hoard shall strive."""
2731,XXXIII,"Beowulf spake, and a battle-vow made"
2732,XXXIII,"his last of all:  ""I have lived through many"
2733,XXXIII,"wars in my youth; now once again,"
2734,XXXIII,"old folk-defender, feud will I seek,"
2735,XXXIII,"do doughty deeds, if the dark destroyer"
2736,XXXIII,"forth from his cavern come to fight me!"""
2737,XXXIII,"Then hailed he the helmeted heroes all,"
2738,XXXIII,"for the last time greeting his liegemen dear,"
2739,XXXIII,"comrades of war:  ""I should carry no weapon,"
2740,XXXIII,"no sword to the serpent, if sure I knew"
2741,XXXIII,"how, with such enemy, else my vows"
2742,XXXIII,I could gain as I did in Grendel's day.
2743,XXXIII,"But fire in this fight I must fear me now,"
2744,XXXIII,and poisonous breath; so I bring with me
2745,XXXIII,breastplate and board. {33c} From the barrow's keeper
2746,XXXIII,no footbreadth flee I. One fight shall end
2747,XXXIII,"our war by the wall, as Wyrd allots,"
2748,XXXIII,all mankind's master. My mood is bold
2749,XXXIII,but forbears to boast o'er this battling-flyer.
2750,XXXIII,"-- Now abide by the barrow, ye breastplate-mailed,"
2751,XXXIII,"ye heroes in harness, which of us twain"
2752,XXXIII,better from battle-rush bear his wounds.
2753,XXXIII,"Wait ye the finish. The fight is not yours,"
2754,XXXIII,nor meet for any but me alone
2755,XXXIII,to measure might with this monster here
2756,XXXIII,and play the hero. Hardily I
2757,XXXIII,"shall win that wealth, or war shall seize,"
2758,XXXIII,"cruel killing, your king and lord!"""
2759,XXXIII,"Up stood then with shield the sturdy champion,"
2760,XXXIII,"stayed by the strength of his single manhood,"
2761,XXXIII,and hardy 'neath helmet his harness bore
2762,XXXIII,under cleft of the cliffs:  no coward's path!
2763,XXXIII,"Soon spied by the wall that warrior chief,"
2764,XXXIII,survivor of many a victory-field
2765,XXXIII,"where foemen fought with furious clashings,"
2766,XXXIII,"an arch of stone; and within, a stream"
2767,XXXIII,that broke from the barrow. The brooklet's wave
2768,XXXIII,was hot with fire. The hoard that way
2769,XXXIII,"he never could hope unharmed to near,"
2770,XXXIII,"or endure those deeps, {33d} for the dragon's flame."
2771,XXXIII,"Then let from his breast, for he burst with rage,"
2772,XXXIII,the Weder-Geat prince a word outgo;
2773,XXXIII,stormed the stark-heart; stern went ringing
2774,XXXIII,and clear his cry 'neath the cliff-rocks gray.
2775,XXXIII,The hoard-guard heard a human voice;
2776,XXXIII,his rage was enkindled. No respite now
2777,XXXIII,for pact of peace! The poison-breath
2778,XXXIII,"of that foul worm first came forth from the cave,"
2779,XXXIII,hot reek-of-fight:  the rocks resounded.
2780,XXXIII,"Stout by the stone-way his shield he raised,"
2781,XXXIII,"lord of the Geats, against the loathed-one;"
2782,XXXIII,while with courage keen that coiled foe
2783,XXXIII,came seeking strife. The sturdy king
2784,XXXIII,"had drawn his sword, not dull of edge,"
2785,XXXIII,heirloom old; and each of the two
2786,XXXIII,"felt fear of his foe, though fierce their mood."
2787,XXXIII,Stoutly stood with his shield high-raised
2788,XXXIII,"the warrior king, as the worm now coiled"
2789,XXXIII,together amain:  the mailed-one waited.
2790,XXXIII,"Now, spire by spire, fast sped and glided"
2791,XXXIII,"that blazing serpent. The shield protected,"
2792,XXXIII,soul and body a shorter while
2793,XXXIII,"for the hero-king than his heart desired,"
2794,XXXIII,could his will have wielded the welcome respite
2795,XXXIII,"but once in his life! But Wyrd denied it,"
2796,XXXIII,and victory's honors. -- His arm he lifted
2797,XXXIII,"lord of the Geats, the grim foe smote"
2798,XXXIII,with atheling's heirloom. Its edge was turned
2799,XXXIII,"brown blade, on the bone, and bit more feebly"
2800,XXXIII,than its noble master had need of then
2801,XXXIII,in his baleful stress. -- Then the barrow's keeper
2802,XXXIII,"waxed full wild for that weighty blow,"
2803,XXXIII,cast deadly flames; wide drove and far
2804,XXXIII,those vicious fires. No victor's glory
2805,XXXIII,"the Geats' lord boasted; his brand had failed,"
2806,XXXIII,"naked in battle, as never it should,"
2807,XXXIII,excellent iron! -- 'Twas no easy path
2808,XXXIII,that Ecgtheow's honored heir must tread
2809,XXXIII,over the plain to the place of the foe;
2810,XXXIII,for against his will he must win a home
2811,XXXIII,"elsewhere far, as must all men, leaving"
2812,XXXIII,this lapsing life! -- Not long it was
2813,XXXIII,ere those champions grimly closed again.
2814,XXXIII,The hoard-guard was heartened; high heaved his breast
2815,XXXIII,"once more; and by peril was pressed again,"
2816,XXXIII,"enfolded in flames, the folk-commander!"
2817,XXXIII,"Nor yet about him his band of comrades,"
2818,XXXIII,"sons of athelings, armed stood"
2819,XXXIII,"with warlike front:  to the woods they bent them,"
2820,XXXIII,their lives to save. But the soul of one
2821,XXXIII,with care was cumbered. Kinship true
2822,XXXIII,can never be marred in a noble mind!
2823,XXXIII,
2824,XXXIII,
2825,XXXIII,
2826,XXXIV,XXXIV
2827,XXXIV,
2828,XXXIV,"WIGLAF his name was, Weohstan's son,"
2829,XXXIV,"linden-thane loved, the lord of Scylfings,"
2830,XXXIV,Aelfhere's kinsman. His king he now saw
2831,XXXIV,with heat under helmet hard oppressed.
2832,XXXIV,"He minded the prizes his prince had given him,"
2833,XXXIV,"wealthy seat of the Waegmunding line,"
2834,XXXIV,and folk-rights that his father owned
2835,XXXIV,"Not long he lingered. The linden yellow,"
2836,XXXIV,"his shield, he seized; the old sword he drew:  --"
2837,XXXIV,"as heirloom of Eanmund earth-dwellers knew it,"
2838,XXXIV,"who was slain by the sword-edge, son of Ohtere,"
2839,XXXIV,"friendless exile, erst in fray"
2840,XXXIV,"killed by Weohstan, who won for his kin"
2841,XXXIV,"brown-bright helmet, breastplate ringed,"
2842,XXXIV,"old sword of Eotens, Onela's gift,"
2843,XXXIV,"weeds of war of the warrior-thane,"
2844,XXXIV,battle-gear brave:  though a brother's child
2845,XXXIV,"had been felled, the feud was unfelt by Onela. {34a}"
2846,XXXIV,"For winters this war-gear Weohstan kept,"
2847,XXXIV,"breastplate and board, till his bairn had grown"
2848,XXXIV,earlship to earn as the old sire did:
2849,XXXIV,"then he gave him, mid Geats, the gear of battle,"
2850,XXXIV,"portion huge, when he passed from life,"
2851,XXXIV,fared aged forth. For the first time now
2852,XXXIV,with his leader-lord the liegeman young
2853,XXXIV,was bidden to share the shock of battle.
2854,XXXIV,"Neither softened his soul, nor the sire's bequest"
2855,XXXIV,weakened in war. {34b} So the worm found out
2856,XXXIV,when once in fight the foes had met!
2857,XXXIV,"Wiglaf spake, -- and his words were sage;"
2858,XXXIV,"sad in spirit, he said to his comrades:  --"
2859,XXXIV,"""I remember the time, when mead we took,"
2860,XXXIV,what promise we made to this prince of ours
2861,XXXIV,"in the banquet-hall, to our breaker-of-rings,"
2862,XXXIV,"for gear of combat to give him requital,"
2863,XXXIV,"for hard-sword and helmet, if hap should bring"
2864,XXXIV,stress of this sort! Himself who chose us
2865,XXXIV,"from all his army to aid him now,"
2866,XXXIV,"urged us to glory, and gave these treasures,"
2867,XXXIV,because he counted us keen with the spear
2868,XXXIV,"and hardy 'neath helm, though this hero-work"
2869,XXXIV,our leader hoped unhelped and alone
2870,XXXIV,"to finish for us, -- folk-defender"
2871,XXXIV,who hath got him glory greater than all men
2872,XXXIV,for daring deeds! Now the day is come
2873,XXXIV,that our noble master has need of the might
2874,XXXIV,of warriors stout. Let us stride along
2875,XXXIV,the hero to help while the heat is about him
2876,XXXIV,glowing and grim! For God is my witness
2877,XXXIV,I am far more fain the fire should seize
2878,XXXIV,along with my lord these limbs of mine! {34c}
2879,XXXIV,Unsuiting it seems our shields to bear
2880,XXXIV,"homeward hence, save here we essay"
2881,XXXIV,to fell the foe and defend the life
2882,XXXIV,of the Weders' lord. I wot 'twere shame
2883,XXXIV,on the law of our land if alone the king
2884,XXXIV,out of Geatish warriors woe endured
2885,XXXIV,"and sank in the struggle! My sword and helmet,"
2886,XXXIV,"breastplate and board, for us both shall serve!"""
2887,XXXIV,"Through slaughter-reek strode he to succor his chieftain,"
2888,XXXIV,"his battle-helm bore, and brief words spake:  --"
2889,XXXIV,"""Beowulf dearest, do all bravely,"
2890,XXXIV,as in youthful days of yore thou vowedst
2891,XXXIV,that while life should last thou wouldst let no wise
2892,XXXIV,"thy glory droop! Now, great in deeds,"
2893,XXXIV,"atheling steadfast, with all thy strength"
2894,XXXIV,"shield thy life! I will stand to help thee."""
2895,XXXIV,"At the words the worm came once again,"
2896,XXXIV,"murderous monster mad with rage,"
2897,XXXIV,"with fire-billows flaming, its foes to seek,"
2898,XXXIV,the hated men. In heat-waves burned
2899,XXXIV,"that board {34d} to the boss, and the breastplate failed"
2900,XXXIV,to shelter at all the spear-thane young.
2901,XXXIV,Yet quickly under his kinsman's shield
2902,XXXIV,"went eager the earl, since his own was now"
2903,XXXIV,all burned by the blaze. The bold king again
2904,XXXIV,had mind of his glory:  with might his glaive
2905,XXXIV,"was driven into the dragon's head, --"
2906,XXXIV,"blow nerved by hate. But Naegling {34e} was shivered,"
2907,XXXIV,"broken in battle was Beowulf's sword,"
2908,XXXIV,old and gray. 'Twas granted him not
2909,XXXIV,that ever the edge of iron at all
2910,XXXIV,"could help him at strife:  too strong was his hand,"
2911,XXXIV,"so the tale is told, and he tried too far"
2912,XXXIV,"with strength of stroke all swords he wielded,"
2913,XXXIV,though sturdy their steel:  they steaded him nought.
2914,XXXIV,Then for the third time thought on its feud
2915,XXXIV,"that folk-destroyer, fire-dread dragon,"
2916,XXXIV,"and rushed on the hero, where room allowed,"
2917,XXXIV,"battle-grim, burning; its bitter teeth"
2918,XXXIV,"closed on his neck, and covered him"
2919,XXXIV,with waves of blood from his breast that welled.
2920,XXXIV,
2921,XXXIV,
2922,XXXIV,
2923,XXXV,XXXV
2924,XXXV,
2925,XXXV,"'TWAS now, men say, in his sovran's need"
2926,XXXV,"that the earl made known his noble strain,"
2927,XXXV,craft and keenness and courage enduring.
2928,XXXV,"Heedless of harm, though his hand was burned,"
2929,XXXV,"hardy-hearted, he helped his kinsman."
2930,XXXV,A little lower the loathsome beast
2931,XXXV,he smote with sword; his steel drove in
2932,XXXV,bright and burnished; that blaze began
2933,XXXV,to lose and lessen. At last the king
2934,XXXV,"wielded his wits again, war-knife drew,"
2935,XXXV,"a biting blade by his breastplate hanging,"
2936,XXXV,"and the Weders'-helm smote that worm asunder,"
2937,XXXV,"felled the foe, flung forth its life."
2938,XXXV,"So had they killed it, kinsmen both,"
2939,XXXV,athelings twain:  thus an earl should be
2940,XXXV,in danger's day! -- Of deeds of valor
2941,XXXV,"this conqueror's-hour of the king was last,"
2942,XXXV,"of his work in the world. The wound began,"
2943,XXXV,"which that dragon-of-earth had erst inflicted,"
2944,XXXV,to swell and smart; and soon he found
2945,XXXV,"in his breast was boiling, baleful and deep,"
2946,XXXV,"pain of poison. The prince walked on,"
2947,XXXV,"wise in his thought, to the wall of rock;"
2948,XXXV,"then sat, and stared at the structure of giants,"
2949,XXXV,where arch of stone and steadfast column
2950,XXXV,upheld forever that hall in earth.
2951,XXXV,Yet here must the hand of the henchman peerless
2952,XXXV,"lave with water his winsome lord,"
2953,XXXV,"the king and conqueror covered with blood,"
2954,XXXV,"with struggle spent, and unspan his helmet."
2955,XXXV,"Beowulf spake in spite of his hurt,"
2956,XXXV,his mortal wound; full well he knew
2957,XXXV,his portion now was past and gone
2958,XXXV,"of earthly bliss, and all had fled"
2959,XXXV,"of his file of days, and death was near:"
2960,XXXV,"""I would fain bestow on son of mine"
2961,XXXV,"this gear of war, were given me now"
2962,XXXV,that any heir should after me come
2963,XXXV,of my proper blood. This people I ruled
2964,XXXV,"fifty winters. No folk-king was there,"
2965,XXXV,"none at all, of the neighboring clans"
2966,XXXV,who war would wage me with 'warriors'-friends' {35a}
2967,XXXV,and threat me with horrors. At home I bided
2968,XXXV,"what fate might come, and I cared for mine own;"
2969,XXXV,"feuds I sought not, nor falsely swore"
2970,XXXV,"ever on oath. For all these things,"
2971,XXXV,"though fatally wounded, fain am I!"
2972,XXXV,"From the Ruler-of-Man no wrath shall seize me,"
2973,XXXV,"when life from my frame must flee away,"
2974,XXXV,for killing of kinsmen! Now quickly go
2975,XXXV,"and gaze on that hoard 'neath the hoary rock,"
2976,XXXV,"Wiglaf loved, now the worm lies low,"
2977,XXXV,"sleeps, heart-sore, of his spoil bereaved."
2978,XXXV,And fare in haste. I would fain behold
2979,XXXV,"the gorgeous heirlooms, golden store,"
2980,XXXV,"have joy in the jewels and gems, lay down"
2981,XXXV,softlier for sight of this splendid hoard
2982,XXXV,"my life and the lordship I long have held."""

2987,XXXVI,
2988,XXXVI,I HAVE heard that swiftly the son of Weohstan
2989,XXXVI,"at wish and word of his wounded king, --"
2990,XXXVI,"war-sick warrior, -- woven mail-coat,"
2991,XXXVI,"battle-sark, bore 'neath the barrow's roof."
2992,XXXVI,"Then the clansman keen, of conquest proud,"
2993,XXXVI,"passing the seat, {36a} saw store of jewels"
2994,XXXVI,and glistening gold the ground along;
2995,XXXVI,"by the wall were marvels, and many a vessel"
2996,XXXVI,"in the den of the dragon, the dawn-flier old:"
2997,XXXVI,unburnished bowls of bygone men
2998,XXXVI,reft of richness; rusty helms
2999,XXXVI,of the olden age; and arm-rings many
3000,XXXVI,"wondrously woven. -- Such wealth of gold,"
3001,XXXVI,"booty from barrow, can burden with pride"
3002,XXXVI,each human wight:  let him hide it who will! --
3003,XXXVI,His glance too fell on a gold-wove banner
3004,XXXVI,"high o'er the hoard, of handiwork noblest,"
3005,XXXVI,"brilliantly broidered; so bright its gleam,"
3006,XXXVI,all the earth-floor he easily saw
3007,XXXVI,and viewed all these vessels. No vestige now
3008,XXXVI,was seen of the serpent:  the sword had ta'en him.
3009,XXXVI,"Then, I heard, the hill of its hoard was reft,"
3010,XXXVI,"old work of giants, by one alone;"
3011,XXXVI,he burdened his bosom with beakers and plate
3012,XXXVI,"at his own good will, and the ensign took,"
3013,XXXVI,brightest of beacons. -- The blade of his lord
3014,XXXVI,-- its edge was iron -- had injured deep
3015,XXXVI,one that guarded the golden hoard
3016,XXXVI,many a year and its murder-fire
3017,XXXVI,spread hot round the barrow in horror-billows
3018,XXXVI,"at midnight hour, till it met its doom."
3019,XXXVI,"Hasted the herald, the hoard so spurred him"
3020,XXXVI,"his track to retrace; he was troubled by doubt,"
3021,XXXVI,"high-souled hero, if haply he'd find"
3022,XXXVI,"alive, where he left him, the lord of Weders,"
3023,XXXVI,weakening fast by the wall of the cave.
3024,XXXVI,So he carried the load. His lord and king
3025,XXXVI,"he found all bleeding, famous chief"
3026,XXXVI,at the lapse of life. The liegeman again
3027,XXXVI,"plashed him with water, till point of word"
3028,XXXVI,"broke through the breast-hoard. Beowulf spake,"
3029,XXXVI,"sage and sad, as he stared at the gold. --"
3030,XXXVI,"""For the gold and treasure, to God my thanks,"
3031,XXXVI,"to the Wielder-of-Wonders, with words I say,"
3032,XXXVI,"for what I behold, to Heaven's Lord,"
3033,XXXVI,for the grace that I give such gifts to my folk
3034,XXXVI,or ever the day of my death be run!
3035,XXXVI,Now I've bartered here for booty of treasure
3036,XXXVI,"the last of my life, so look ye well"
3037,XXXVI,to the needs of my land! No longer I tarry.
3038,XXXVI,A barrow bid ye the battle-fanned raise
3039,XXXVI,"for my ashes. 'Twill shine by the shore of the flood,"
3040,XXXVI,to folk of mine memorial fair
3041,XXXVI,"on Hrones Headland high uplifted,"
3042,XXXVI,that ocean-wanderers oft may hail
3043,XXXVI,"Beowulf's Barrow, as back from far"
3044,XXXVI,"they drive their keels o'er the darkling wave."""
3045,XXXVI,"From his neck he unclasped the collar of gold,"
3046,XXXVI,"valorous king, to his vassal gave it"
3047,XXXVI,"with bright-gold helmet, breastplate, and ring,"
3048,XXXVI,to the youthful thane:  bade him use them in joy.
3049,XXXVI,"""Thou art end and remnant of all our race"
3050,XXXVI,"the Waegmunding name. For Wyrd hath swept them,"
3051,XXXVI,"all my line, to the land of doom,"
3052,XXXVI,"earls in their glory:  I after them go."""
3053,XXXVI,This word was the last which the wise old man
3054,XXXVI,harbored in heart ere hot death-waves
3055,XXXVI,of balefire he chose. From his bosom fled
3056,XXXVI,his soul to seek the saints' reward.

3058,XXXVI,
3059,XXXVI,
3060,XXXVII,XXXVII
3061,XXXVII,
3062,XXXVII,IT was heavy hap for that hero young
3063,XXXVII,on his lord beloved to look and find him
3064,XXXVII,"lying on earth with life at end,"
3065,XXXVII,"sorrowful sight. But the slayer too,"
3066,XXXVII,"awful earth-dragon, empty of breath,"
3067,XXXVII,"lay felled in fight, nor, fain of its treasure,"
3068,XXXVII,could the writhing monster rule it more.
3069,XXXVII,"For edges of iron had ended its days,"
3070,XXXVII,"hard and battle-sharp, hammers' leaving; {37a}"
3071,XXXVII,and that flier-afar had fallen to ground
3072,XXXVII,"hushed by its hurt, its hoard all near,"
3073,XXXVII,no longer lusty aloft to whirl
3074,XXXVII,"at midnight, making its merriment seen,"
3075,XXXVII,proud of its prizes:  prone it sank
3076,XXXVII,by the handiwork of the hero-king.
3077,XXXVII,"Forsooth among folk but few achieve,"
3078,XXXVII,"-- though sturdy and strong, as stories tell me,"
3079,XXXVII,"and never so daring in deed of valor, --"
3080,XXXVII,the perilous breath of a poison-foe
3081,XXXVII,"to brave, and to rush on the ring-board hall,"
3082,XXXVII,whenever his watch the warden keeps
3083,XXXVII,bold in the barrow. Beowulf paid
3084,XXXVII,the price of death for that precious hoard;
3085,XXXVII,and each of the foes had found the end
3086,XXXVII,of this fleeting life.
3087,XXXVII,Befell erelong
3088,XXXVII,"that the laggards in war the wood had left,"
3089,XXXVII,"trothbreakers, cowards, ten together,"
3090,XXXVII,fearing before to flourish a spear
3091,XXXVII,in the sore distress of their sovran lord.
3092,XXXVII,"Now in their shame their shields they carried,"
3093,XXXVII,"armor of fight, where the old man lay;"
3094,XXXVII,and they gazed on Wiglaf. Wearied he sat
3095,XXXVII,"at his sovran's shoulder, shieldsman good,"
3096,XXXVII,to wake him with water. {37b} Nowise it availed.
3097,XXXVII,"Though well he wished it, in world no more"
3098,XXXVII,could he barrier life for that leader-of-battles
3099,XXXVII,nor baffle the will of all-wielding God.
3100,XXXVII,Doom of the Lord was law o'er the deeds
3101,XXXVII,"of every man, as it is to-day."
3102,XXXVII,"Grim was the answer, easy to get,"
3103,XXXVII,from the youth for those that had yielded to fear!
3104,XXXVII,"Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan, --"
3105,XXXVII,mournful he looked on those men unloved:  --
3106,XXXVII,"""Who sooth will speak, can say indeed"
3107,XXXVII,that the ruler who gave you golden rings
3108,XXXVII,and the harness of war in which ye stand
3109,XXXVII,-- for he at ale-bench often-times
3110,XXXVII,"bestowed on hall-folk helm and breastplate,"
3111,XXXVII,"lord to liegemen, the likeliest gear"
3112,XXXVII,"which near of far he could find to give, --"
3113,XXXVII,"threw away and wasted these weeds of battle,"
3114,XXXVII,on men who failed when the foemen came!
3115,XXXVII,Not at all could the king of his comrades-in-arms
3116,XXXVII,"venture to vaunt, though the Victory-Wielder,"
3117,XXXVII,"God, gave him grace that he got revenge"
3118,XXXVII,sole with his sword in stress and need.
3119,XXXVII,"To rescue his life, 'twas little that I"
3120,XXXVII,could serve him in struggle; yet shift I made
3121,XXXVII,(hopeless it seemed) to help my kinsman.
3122,XXXVII,"Its strength ever waned, when with weapon I struck"
3123,XXXVII,"that fatal foe, and the fire less strongly"
3124,XXXVII,flowed from its head. -- Too few the heroes
3125,XXXVII,in throe of contest that thronged to our king!
3126,XXXVII,"Now gift of treasure and girding of sword,"
3127,XXXVII,joy of the house and home-delight
3128,XXXVII,shall fail your folk; his freehold-land
3129,XXXVII,every clansman within your kin
3130,XXXVII,"shall lose and leave, when lords high-born"

3142,XXXVIII,"daring shieldsmen, in doubt of twain:"
3143,XXXVIII,"would they wail as dead, or welcome home,"
3144,XXXVIII,their lord beloved? Little {38a} kept back

3151,XXXVIII,with knife-wounds sick:  {38b} no sword availed
3152,XXXVIII,on the awesome thing in any wise

3155,XXXVIII,"the living earl by the other dead,"

3158,XXXVIII,for waging of war when once unhidden
3159,XXXVIII,to Frisian and Frank the fall of the king
3160,XXXVIII,is spread afar. -- The strife began
3161,XXXVIII,when hot on the Hugas {38d} Hygelac fell
3162,XXXVIII,and fared with his fleet to the Frisian land.
3163,XXXVIII,"Him there the Hetwaras humbled in war,"
3164,XXXVIII,plied with such prowess their power o'erwhelming
3165,XXXVIII,that the bold-in-battle bowed beneath it
3166,XXXVIII,and fell in fight. To his friends no wise
3167,XXXVIII,could that earl give treasure! And ever since
3168,XXXVIII,the Merowings' favor has failed us wholly.
3169,XXXVIII,Nor aught expect I of peace and faith
3170,XXXVIII,from Swedish folk. 'Twas spread afar
3171,XXXVIII,how Ongentheow reft at Ravenswood
3172,XXXVIII,"Haethcyn Hrethling of hope and life,"
3173,XXXVIII,when the folk of Geats for the first time sought
3174,XXXVIII,in wanton pride the Warlike-Scylfings.

3224,XXXIX,Nor swift enough was the son of Wonred

3286,XXXIX,"sad, they climbed to the Cliff-of-Eagles,"
3287,XXXIX,"went, welling with tears, the wonder to view."
3288,XXXIX,"Found on the sand there, stretched at rest,"
3289,XXXIX,"their lifeless lord, who had lavished rings"
3290,XXXIX,of old upon them. Ending-day
3291,XXXIX,had dawned on the doughty-one; death had seized
3292,XXXIX,in woful slaughter the Weders' king.
3293,XXXIX,"There saw they, besides, the strangest being,"
3294,XXXIX,"loathsome, lying their leader near,"
3295,XXXIX,"prone on the field. The fiery dragon,"
3296,XXXIX,"fearful fiend, with flame was scorched."
3297,XXXIX,"Reckoned by feet, it was fifty measures"
3298,XXXIX,in length as it lay. Aloft erewhile
3299,XXXIX,"it had revelled by night, and anon come back,"
3300,XXXIX,seeking its den; now in death's sure clutch
3301,XXXIX,it had come to the end of its earth-hall joys.
3302,XXXIX,By it there stood the stoups and jars;
3303,XXXIX,"dishes lay there, and dear-decked swords"
3304,XXXIX,"eaten with rust, as, on earth's lap resting,"
3305,XXXIX,a thousand winters they waited there.
3306,XXXIX,"For all that heritage huge, that gold"

3354,XL,still wielding his wits. The wise old man
3355,XL,"spake much in his sorrow, and sent you greetings"
3356,XL,"and bade that ye build, when he breathed no more,"

3386,XL,No lots they cast for keeping the hoard
3387,XL,"when once the warriors saw it in hall,"
3388,XL,"altogether without a guardian,"
3389,XL,lying there lost. And little they mourned

3407,XLI,heroes mourning their master dear.
3408,XLI,Then on the hill that hugest of balefires
3409,XLI,the warriors wakened. Wood-smoke rose

3411,XLI,"of flame with weeping (the wind was still),"

3424,XLI,"in ten days' time their toil had raised it,"
3425,XLI,the battle-brave's beacon. Round brands of the pyre
3426,XLI,"a wall they built, the worthiest ever"
3427,XLI,that wit could prompt in their wisest men.
3428,XLI,"They placed in the barrow that precious booty,"
3429,XLI,"the rounds and the rings they had reft erewhile,"

3433,XLI,useless to men as of yore it was.
3434,XLI,"Then about that barrow the battle-keen rode,"
3435,XLI,"atheling-born, a band of twelve,"
3436,XLI,"lament to make, to mourn their king,"
3437,XLI,"chant their dirge, and their chieftain honor."
3438,XLI,"They praised his earlship, his acts of prowess"

3615,XLI,"nevertheless has a ""castle"" outside the Frisian border, marries"
3616,XLI,"Hildeburh, a Danish princess; and her brother, Hnaef, with many"
3617,XLI,"other Danes, pays Finn a visit. Relations between the two peoples"
3618,XLI,have been strained before. Something starts the old feud anew; and
3619,XLI,the visitors are attacked in their quarters. Hnaef is killed; so is
3620,XLI,a son of Hildeburh. Many fall on both sides. Peace is patched up; a
3621,XLI,stately funeral is held; and the surviving visitors become in a way
3622,XLI,"vassals or liegemen of Finn, going back with him to Frisia. So"
3623,XLI,matters rest a while. Hengest is now leader of the Danes; but he is
3624,XLI,"set upon revenge for his former lord, Hnaef. Probably he is killed"
3625,XLI,"in feud; but his clansmen, Guthlaf and Oslaf, gather at their home a"

3658,XLI,"assurances on his probity. ""My own Hrothulf"" will surely not forget"

3666,XLI,"{20b} The connection is not difficult. The words of mourning, of"
3667,XLI,"acute grief, are said; and according to Germanic sequence of"
3668,XLI,"thought, inexorable here, the next and only topic is revenge. But is"
3669,XLI,it possible? Hrothgar leads up to his appeal and promise with a
3670,XLI,skillful and often effective description of the horrors which
3671,XLI,surround the monster's home and await the attempt of an avenging
3672,XLI,foe.
3673,XLI,
3674,XLI,{21a} Hrothgar is probably meant.

3715,XLI,"{27c} Kenning for ""wife."""
3716,XLI,
3717,XLI,{28a} Beowulf gives his uncle the king not mere gossip of his
3718,XLI,"journey, but a statesmanlike forecast of the outcome of certain"
3719,XLI,policies at the Danish court. Talk of interpolation here is absurd.
3720,XLI,"As both Beowulf and Hygelac know, -- and the folk for whom the"
3721,XLI,"Beowulf was put together also knew, -- Froda was king of the"
3722,XLI,"Heathobards (probably the Langobards, once near neighbors of Angle"
3723,XLI,"and Saxon tribes on the continent), and had fallen in fight with the"
3724,XLI,Danes. Hrothgar will set aside this feud by giving his daughter as
3725,XLI,"""peace-weaver"" and wife to the young king Ingeld, son of the slain"
3726,XLI,"Froda. But Beowulf, on general principles and from his observation"
3727,XLI,"of the particular case, foretells trouble. Note:"
3728,XLI,
3729,XLI,"{28b} Play of shields, battle. A Danish warrior cuts down Froda in"
3730,XLI,"the fight, and takes his sword and armor, leaving them to a son."
3731,XLI,"This son is selected to accompany his mistress, the young princess"
3732,XLI,"Freawaru, to her new home when she is Ingeld's queen. Heedlessly he"
3733,XLI,wears the sword of Froda in hall. An old warrior points it out to
3734,XLI,"Ingeld, and eggs him on to vengeance. At his instigation the Dane is"
3735,XLI,"killed; but the murderer, afraid of results, and knowing the land,"
3736,XLI,escapes. So the old feud must break out again.

3740,XLI,
3741,XLI,{28d} The sword.
3742,XLI,
3743,XLI,{28e} Beowulf returns to his forecast. Things might well go somewhat
3744,XLI,"as follows, he says; sketches a little tragic story; and with this"
3745,XLI,prophecy by illustration returns to the tale of his adventure.

3758,XLI,
3759,XLI,"{29d} The chronology of this epic, as scholars have worked it out,"
3760,XLI,would make Beowulf well over ninety years of age when he fights the
3761,XLI,dragon. But the fifty years of his reign need not be taken as
3762,XLI,historical fact.
3763,XLI,
3764,XLI,"{29e} The text is here hopelessly illegible, and only the general"
3765,XLI,"drift of the meaning can be rescued. For one thing, we have the old"
3766,XLI,myth of a dragon who guards hidden treasure. But with this runs the
3767,XLI,"story of some noble, last of his race, who hides all his wealth"
3768,XLI,within this barrow and there chants his farewell to life's glories.
3769,XLI,After his death the dragon takes possession of the hoard and watches
3770,XLI,"over it. A condemned or banished man, desperate, hides in the"
3771,XLI,"barrow, discovers the treasure, and while the dragon sleeps, makes"
3772,XLI,"off with a golden beaker or the like, and carries it for"
3773,XLI,propitiation to his master. The dragon discovers the loss and exacts
3774,XLI,fearful penalty from the people round about.

3810,XLI,
3811,XLI,{34b} Both Wiglaf and the sword did their duty. -- The following is
3812,XLI,one of the classic passages for illustrating the comitatus as the

3865,XLI,
3866,XLI,{40c} Ten Brink points out the strongly heathen character of this
3867,XLI,"part of the epic. Beowulf's end came, so the old tradition ran, from"
3868,XLI,his unwitting interference with spell-bound treasure.
3869,XLI,
